00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
days of it
 
00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:29.160 align:start position:0%
so I've been dealing with a lot of water
 
00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:32.520 align:start position:0%
in Acworth where we we have all
 
00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:35.160 align:start position:0%
horrible uh measures of flooding going
 
00:06:37.249 --> 00:06:37.259 align:start position:0%
on anyway
 
00:06:37.259 --> 00:06:37.909 align:start position:0%
on anyway
um

00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:37.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:41.400 align:start position:0%
I would like to start off with
 
00:06:43.189 --> 00:06:43.199 align:start position:0%
our first bill
 
00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:45.380 align:start position:0%
HB 37
 
00:06:47.629 --> 00:06:47.639 align:start position:0%
establishing a committee to study best
 
00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:51.060 align:start position:0%
practices for companion animal groomers
 
00:06:53.689 --> 00:06:53.699 align:start position:0%
and I would like to entertain any
 
00:06:58.010 --> 00:06:58.020 align:start position:0%
comments about what we may or may not do
 
00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:00.680 align:start position:0%
with this bill and your thoughts on it
 
00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:03.360 align:start position:0%
if there's any particular
 
00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:04.070 align:start position:0%
if there's any particular
um

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:07.309 --> 00:07:07.319 align:start position:0%
work that you feel needs to be done on
 
00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:09.240 align:start position:0%
it or
 
00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.309 align:start position:0%
it or
whatever

00:07:10.309 --> 00:07:10.319 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:12.180 align:start position:0%
representative Brouillard
 
00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:13.740 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:15.900 align:start position:0%
uh so I believe that we're already over
 
00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:19.020 align:start position:0%
permitted we're already over licensed uh
 
00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:21.360 align:start position:0%
I think it should be up to the consumer
 
00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:25.080 align:start position:0%
to let them see uh whoever they do so
 
00:07:27.409 --> 00:07:27.419 align:start position:0%
choose to go to for their animal
 
00:07:30.469 --> 00:07:30.479 align:start position:0%
grooming activity to say okay what what
 
00:07:32.749 --> 00:07:32.759 align:start position:0%
makes this person qualified are they
 
00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:34.440 align:start position:0%
certified have they gone to some sort of
 
00:07:37.249 --> 00:07:37.259 align:start position:0%
Institute let them hear by you know Word
 
00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:40.080 align:start position:0%
of Mouth ratings let them be the ones to
 
00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:41.629 align:start position:0%
of Mouth ratings let them be the ones to
decide

00:07:41.629 --> 00:07:41.639 align:start position:0%
decide
 
00:07:41.639 --> 00:07:42.290 align:start position:0%
decide
um

00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:42.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:45.960 align:start position:0%
the groomers expertise
 
00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:49.620 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:07:52.129 --> 00:07:52.139 align:start position:0%
yeah representative germano thank you
 
00:07:54.529 --> 00:07:54.539 align:start position:0%
madam chair uh and with respect to my
 
00:07:55.969 --> 00:07:55.979 align:start position:0%
colleagues comments that say this
 
00:07:57.409 --> 00:07:57.419 align:start position:0%
committee doesn't necessarily have to
 
00:07:59.270 --> 00:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
result in more permitting or regulations
 
00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:00.780 align:start position:0%
one of the things we talked about was
 
00:08:02.629 --> 00:08:02.639 align:start position:0%
that there might be a set of
 
00:08:05.089 --> 00:08:05.099 align:start position:0%
recommendations for example or questions
 
00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:07.860 align:start position:0%
about where policies needed to be posted
 
00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:11.160 align:start position:0%
Etc so uh I it's not a foregone
 
00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:13.020 align:start position:0%
conclusion by any means that the result
 
00:08:14.629 --> 00:08:14.639 align:start position:0%
of a study committee is going to be
 
00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:16.620 align:start position:0%
excess permitting or anything like that
 
00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:19.500 align:start position:0%
so uh whatever the outcome eventually is
 
00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:21.840 align:start position:0%
uh I just want us to be clear about that
 
00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
and personally I think from some of the
 
00:08:26.749 --> 00:08:26.759 align:start position:0%
testimony we heard before uh that that
 
00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:28.440 align:start position:0%
some of the things that even fall short
 
00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:30.180 align:start position:0%
of any additional regulations or
 
00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
permitting uh could potentially be
 
00:08:34.909 --> 00:08:34.919 align:start position:0%
helpful to the industry and to uh and to
 
00:08:34.919 --> 00:08:38.149 align:start position:0%
helpful to the industry and to uh and to
clients

00:08:38.149 --> 00:08:38.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:40.740 align:start position:0%
oh representative Creighton
 
00:08:44.449 --> 00:08:44.459 align:start position:0%
I agree that that other things could
 
00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:46.640 align:start position:0%
come out of here other than licensure
 
00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:49.860 align:start position:0%
however I would say that the committee
 
00:08:51.769 --> 00:08:51.779 align:start position:0%
is not going to add any expertise that's
 
00:08:53.329 --> 00:08:53.339 align:start position:0%
not already out there provided by the
 
00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:56.180 align:start position:0%
AKC or other
 
00:08:58.130 --> 00:08:58.140 align:start position:0%
agencies that
 
00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:00.300 align:start position:0%
are private agencies that actually do
 
00:09:02.449 --> 00:09:02.459 align:start position:0%
have the expertise so the committee
 
00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:04.200 align:start position:0%
would be hearing from experts that are
 
00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
already deeply involved in the situation
 
00:09:08.449 --> 00:09:08.459 align:start position:0%
I don't think providing anything new
 
00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:10.740 align:start position:0%
other than an additional committee that
 
00:09:15.769 --> 00:09:15.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:18.060 align:start position:0%
representative Howard
 
00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I
 
00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:25.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:27.889 --> 00:09:27.899 align:start position:0%
a question that representative Creighton
 
00:09:30.530 --> 00:09:30.540 align:start position:0%
mentions so and along with information
 
00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:32.030 align:start position:0%
mentions so and along with information
about

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:32.040 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:33.720 align:start position:0%
um potential harms done by these
 
00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:36.180 align:start position:0%
individuals or the this profession and
 
00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:36.949 align:start position:0%
individuals or the this profession and
and

00:09:36.949 --> 00:09:36.959 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:39.000 align:start position:0%
um like a collection of information
 
00:09:41.269 --> 00:09:41.279 align:start position:0%
about how much how how frequently that
 
00:09:41.279 --> 00:09:44.210 align:start position:0%
about how much how how frequently that
happens

00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:44.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:47.769 --> 00:09:47.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:50.329 --> 00:09:50.339 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry representative Murray I'm like
 
00:09:53.269 --> 00:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
popping my eye in here uh thank you
 
00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:56.100 align:start position:0%
madam chair um yeah I think also I'd
 
00:09:58.130 --> 00:09:58.140 align:start position:0%
like to mention that we heard compelling
 
00:10:01.009 --> 00:10:01.019 align:start position:0%
sort of testimony regarding some
 
00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
situations that had Arisen as a result
 
00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:05.940 align:start position:0%
of some experiences that
 
00:10:08.329 --> 00:10:08.339 align:start position:0%
um resulted in sort of concern and
 
00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
oversight around animal welfare and I do
 
00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:13.200 align:start position:0%
think that it's important that uh the
 
00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:16.500 align:start position:0%
charge does say that it's looking at a
 
00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:19.140 align:start position:0%
few sort of areas so it's not a wide
 
00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:21.060 align:start position:0%
open area
 
00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:22.980 align:start position:0%
um it discusses safety and facility
 
00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:25.260 align:start position:0%
standards possible certification and
 
00:10:27.769 --> 00:10:27.779 align:start position:0%
life licensure and then
 
00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:30.060 align:start position:0%
um waste and disposals so those are
 
00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
things that even are very germane to
 
00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:33.420 align:start position:0%
some of the other topics we discuss in
 
00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:35.389 align:start position:0%
the committee
um

00:10:35.389 --> 00:10:35.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:38.040 align:start position:0%
and maybe as representative germana said
 
00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
other types of recommendations may come
 
00:10:44.389 --> 00:10:44.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:47.050 --> 00:10:47.060 align:start position:0%
there you go thank you representative
 
00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:49.500 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:50.449 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
um

00:10:50.449 --> 00:10:50.459 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:54.720 align:start position:0%
having sat through listening to uh this
 
00:10:59.210 --> 00:10:59.220 align:start position:0%
legislation for the last two terms
 
00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:01.800 align:start position:0%
um it seems that it's the same people
 
00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:04.500 align:start position:0%
and it's the same
 
00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:06.650 align:start position:0%
and it's the same
um

00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:06.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:09.300 align:start position:0%
person that keeps or people that keep
 
00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
bringing this up and we have thousands
 
00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:13.860 align:start position:0%
in the state and if you talk to
 
00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:15.480 align:start position:0%
different people across the state in
 
00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:17.820 align:start position:0%
this industry that are doing a great job
 
00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
they don't want to see anything else
 
00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:22.920 align:start position:0%
done they are perfectly happy they
 
00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:25.800 align:start position:0%
regulate themselves word of mouth is one
 
00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
of the most damaging things that can
 
00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:31.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:33.410 --> 00:11:33.420 align:start position:0%
representative knabb
 
00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:11:36.889 --> 00:11:36.899 align:start position:0%
um I just want to comment that the many
 
00:11:38.449 --> 00:11:38.459 align:start position:0%
people I've mentioned this to have been
 
00:11:40.069 --> 00:11:40.079 align:start position:0%
surprised that there isn't any sort of
 
00:11:41.569 --> 00:11:41.579 align:start position:0%
Standards or practice around animal
 
00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:43.200 align:start position:0%
grooming and
 
00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:44.820 align:start position:0%
um I asked my dog groomer about it and
 
00:11:45.949 --> 00:11:45.959 align:start position:0%
she said that some of the things that
 
00:11:47.329 --> 00:11:47.339 align:start position:0%
were done in the situation where the dog
 
00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:49.860 align:start position:0%
died they would never do so you know I
 
00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:51.300 align:start position:0%
do agree that
 
00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:53.160 align:start position:0%
um creating a permitting process is
 
00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:55.560 align:start position:0%
probably overly cumbersome but I think
 
00:11:58.069 --> 00:11:58.079 align:start position:0%
having just best practices out there
 
00:12:00.829 --> 00:12:00.839 align:start position:0%
could be a good outcome of this
 
00:12:02.569 --> 00:12:02.579 align:start position:0%
um without you know without requiring
 
00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
licensure or permitting it would just
 
00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:06.420 align:start position:0%
create standards that people adhere to
 
00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
so thank you
 
00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:14.760 align:start position:0%
so for my own
 
00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:17.940 align:start position:0%
um point of view on this is first of all
 
00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:20.100 align:start position:0%
in terms of testimony we only had like
 
00:12:23.389 --> 00:12:23.399 align:start position:0%
one or two people come this time as
 
00:12:27.650 --> 00:12:27.660 align:start position:0%
opposed to previous terms we had five
 
00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:30.600 align:start position:0%
the last time so it's not very
 
00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:32.760 align:start position:0%
representative of of
 
00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:33.949 align:start position:0%
representative of of
um

00:12:33.949 --> 00:12:33.959 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:35.880 align:start position:0%
you know the
 
00:12:38.810 --> 00:12:38.820 align:start position:0%
groomer community
 
00:12:42.410 --> 00:12:42.420 align:start position:0%
and the things that are being asked in
 
00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:45.420 align:start position:0%
this bill to study
 
00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:46.550 align:start position:0%
this bill to study
um

00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:49.220 align:start position:0%
safety facility standards possible
 
00:12:51.769 --> 00:12:51.779 align:start position:0%
certification licensure whatever waste
 
00:12:53.329 --> 00:12:53.339 align:start position:0%
and chemical disposal education
 
00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:55.880 align:start position:0%
continuing education
 
00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
I have spoken to members of different
 
00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
animal groups the AKC dogs
 
00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:07.860 align:start position:0%
um various organizations who already
 
00:13:10.129 --> 00:13:10.139 align:start position:0%
have standards in place for their
 
00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:13.700 align:start position:0%
members that their members follow
 
00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:16.860 align:start position:0%
and I would think that that would be
 
00:13:18.829 --> 00:13:18.839 align:start position:0%
sufficient for the community to pretty
 
00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:20.940 align:start position:0%
much educate their own community and
 
00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:22.680 align:start position:0%
police themselves
 
00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:25.860 align:start position:0%
with that information
 
00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:30.240 align:start position:0%
um as well as you know consumers who are
 
00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:35.420 align:start position:0%
aware of whether their dog groomer is
 
00:13:38.389 --> 00:13:38.399 align:start position:0%
certified through the AKC or certified
 
00:13:43.009 --> 00:13:43.019 align:start position:0%
through some other organization so
 
00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
it just seems to me to be redundant to
 
00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:49.560 align:start position:0%
ask the house to have the House and
 
00:13:51.889 --> 00:13:51.899 align:start position:0%
Senate the legislature to have a study
 
00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:54.540 align:start position:0%
committee to do the work that these
 
00:13:56.389 --> 00:13:56.399 align:start position:0%
organizations have already pretty much
 
00:13:56.399 --> 00:13:58.009 align:start position:0%
organizations have already pretty much
done

00:13:58.009 --> 00:13:58.019 align:start position:0%
done
 
00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:00.600 align:start position:0%
um so for my
 
00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:03.480 align:start position:0%
um for my purposes I I don't see any
 
00:14:05.629 --> 00:14:05.639 align:start position:0%
need for this bill at all
 
00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:07.560 align:start position:0%
representative Murray
 
00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:09.480 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:11.880 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to maybe
 
00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
respectfully if I can disagree because I
 
00:14:17.449 --> 00:14:17.459 align:start position:0%
I would like to see that there I'm
 
00:14:18.889 --> 00:14:18.899 align:start position:0%
trying to think about instances and
 
00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:20.760 align:start position:0%
where there are folks in these
 
00:14:22.129 --> 00:14:22.139 align:start position:0%
industries who may not be part of those
 
00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:23.940 align:start position:0%
other organizations that you mentioned
 
00:14:26.569 --> 00:14:26.579 align:start position:0%
and and also
 
00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:28.680 align:start position:0%
um with the discussion of chemical and
 
00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:30.360 align:start position:0%
waste disposal that's really the first
 
00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:33.420 align:start position:0%
time in looking at that sort of niche of
 
00:14:34.730 --> 00:14:34.740 align:start position:0%
of topic
 
00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:35.509 align:start position:0%
of topic
um

00:14:35.509 --> 00:14:35.519 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:38.449 --> 00:14:38.459 align:start position:0%
that we really delved into this I I
 
00:14:39.949 --> 00:14:39.959 align:start position:0%
agree that it has come up in past
 
00:14:42.949 --> 00:14:42.959 align:start position:0%
legislation but as far as this bill and
 
00:14:45.290 --> 00:14:45.300 align:start position:0%
that's the general topic but as far as
 
00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
waste disposal and chemical disposure
 
00:14:50.629 --> 00:14:50.639 align:start position:0%
best practices I would
 
00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:52.620 align:start position:0%
I would like to see there are not at
 
00:14:54.250 --> 00:14:54.260 align:start position:0%
least an opportunity to consider it
 
00:14:56.449 --> 00:14:56.459 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Murray for
 
00:14:58.610 --> 00:14:58.620 align:start position:0%
bringing that up because it seems to me
 
00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:00.720 align:start position:0%
as I recall from my own and maybe
 
00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
representative NAB can chime in on this
 
00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:04.260 align:start position:0%
for my own
 
00:15:08.810 --> 00:15:08.820 align:start position:0%
um knowledge of like local ordinances in
 
00:15:11.449 --> 00:15:11.459 align:start position:0%
various municipalities they already have
 
00:15:14.509 --> 00:15:14.519 align:start position:0%
something in their ordinances to to say
 
00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:19.380 align:start position:0%
how um animal waste is handled and as
 
00:15:20.410 --> 00:15:20.420 align:start position:0%
well as
 
00:15:24.949 --> 00:15:24.959 align:start position:0%
any kind of chemical disposal too it
 
00:15:26.889 --> 00:15:26.899 align:start position:0%
would seem to me that
 
00:15:29.269 --> 00:15:29.279 align:start position:0%
municipalities already have that in
 
00:15:31.129 --> 00:15:31.139 align:start position:0%
their in their codes
 
00:15:31.139 --> 00:15:33.590 align:start position:0%
their in their codes
representative

00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:15:35.689 --> 00:15:35.699 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:38.040 align:start position:0%
if they're using any type of chemicals
 
00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:41.160 align:start position:0%
as we all know the label is the law
 
00:15:43.009 --> 00:15:43.019 align:start position:0%
and I am sure that all of these people
 
00:15:46.310 --> 00:15:46.320 align:start position:0%
are reading the the label and it also
 
00:15:48.590 --> 00:15:48.600 align:start position:0%
talks about how you are disposed of that
 
00:15:50.389 --> 00:15:50.399 align:start position:0%
type of chemical
 
00:15:53.389 --> 00:15:53.399 align:start position:0%
again the label is the law
 
00:15:55.329 --> 00:15:55.339 align:start position:0%
so I don't think there's any additional
 
00:15:58.250 --> 00:15:58.260 align:start position:0%
requirement needed uh regarding that
 
00:16:00.889 --> 00:16:00.899 align:start position:0%
it's pretty straightforward
 
00:16:00.899 --> 00:16:02.930 align:start position:0%
it's pretty straightforward
um

00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:02.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
anyone else representative NAB
 
00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
you very much I don't actually have an
 
00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:08.160 align:start position:0%
answer to your question I'm sorry but I
 
00:16:10.850 --> 00:16:10.860 align:start position:0%
think representative spoke to it
 
00:16:12.650 --> 00:16:12.660 align:start position:0%
um I I recall and I might be wrong about
 
00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:13.800 align:start position:0%
this that one of the outcomes we
 
00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:15.180 align:start position:0%
discussed when we first discussed this
 
00:16:17.689 --> 00:16:17.699 align:start position:0%
bill was standards that already existed
 
00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
and putting them on the USDA or not the
 
00:16:21.769 --> 00:16:21.779 align:start position:0%
USDA the department of agricultural
 
00:16:25.189 --> 00:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
website using standards from the AKC or
 
00:16:27.290 --> 00:16:27.300 align:start position:0%
a similar organization
 
00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:29.220 align:start position:0%
um and just having those posted and is
 
00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
that a potential outcome and something
 
00:16:32.509 --> 00:16:32.519 align:start position:0%
we could direct if we decide not to move
 
00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:34.320 align:start position:0%
forward with this bill I would have to
 
00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:37.440 align:start position:0%
touch base again with commissioner
 
00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:40.320 align:start position:0%
Jasper and find out
 
00:16:43.189 --> 00:16:43.199 align:start position:0%
um if that's doable if they be willing
 
00:16:45.610 --> 00:16:45.620 align:start position:0%
to do that
 
00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:47.880 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby good morning good
 
00:16:52.189 --> 00:16:52.199 align:start position:0%
morning so if we did if we uh decide
 
00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:55.680 align:start position:0%
that uh having uh
 
00:16:57.590 --> 00:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
having the department web page make
 
00:17:00.650 --> 00:17:00.660 align:start position:0%
reference to uh standards that are
 
00:17:02.569 --> 00:17:02.579 align:start position:0%
already out there that's something that
 
00:17:04.730 --> 00:17:04.740 align:start position:0%
we could do by amending this bill rather
 
00:17:06.949 --> 00:17:06.959 align:start position:0%
than by having a study committee
 
00:17:09.590 --> 00:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
so oh so that's so if there's someone
 
00:17:13.549 --> 00:17:13.559 align:start position:0%
who wants to take on that uh task then
 
00:17:15.949 --> 00:17:15.959 align:start position:0%
on bring forward an amendment for when
 
00:17:19.490 --> 00:17:19.500 align:start position:0%
we exec probably in late October then
 
00:17:20.870 --> 00:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
um that would be that would be another
 
00:17:22.909 --> 00:17:22.919 align:start position:0%
approach to this
 
00:17:22.919 --> 00:17:24.710 align:start position:0%
approach to this
okay

00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:24.720 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:27.480 align:start position:0%
anyone else representative Potenza
 
00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
I think that's a great idea if you just
 
00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
spend two minutes in Google the best
 
00:17:36.169 --> 00:17:36.179 align:start position:0%
practices are all there from the ASPCA
 
00:17:36.179 --> 00:17:37.549 align:start position:0%
practices are all there from the ASPCA
um

00:17:37.549 --> 00:17:37.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:40.620 align:start position:0%
it's all so clear in being able to have
 
00:17:42.049 --> 00:17:42.059 align:start position:0%
that information
 
00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
just on a you know on Des website is I
 
00:17:48.169 --> 00:17:48.179 align:start position:0%
think it's great and without having to
 
00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
have a study Community all that so
 
00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:53.640 align:start position:0%
um if nobody else will do that amendment
 
00:17:56.930 --> 00:17:56.940 align:start position:0%
I will I I think that information is key
 
00:17:59.690 --> 00:17:59.700 align:start position:0%
so I think and there's tons of it that
 
00:18:01.610 --> 00:18:01.620 align:start position:0%
would not necessarily that would not be
 
00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:04.200 align:start position:0%
on the Des website that would be on the
 
00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:06.120 align:start position:0%
Department of Agriculture oh yeah I mean
 
00:18:08.210 --> 00:18:08.220 align:start position:0%
Department of Agriculture sorry
 
00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:10.070 align:start position:0%
Department of Agriculture sorry
yeah

00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:11.210 align:start position:0%
yeah
yeah

00:18:11.210 --> 00:18:11.220 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:18:13.669 --> 00:18:13.679 align:start position:0%
all right representative germana
 
00:18:15.650 --> 00:18:15.660 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I I would just
 
00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
like to add that I think that there is
 
00:18:19.669 --> 00:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
an understandable philosophical
 
00:18:21.529 --> 00:18:21.539 align:start position:0%
difference among some of us about how
 
00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:24.480 align:start position:0%
the free market functions and and how to
 
00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:26.520 align:start position:0%
what extent the free market can be
 
00:18:28.789 --> 00:18:28.799 align:start position:0%
expected to regulate itself and the
 
00:18:30.770 --> 00:18:30.780 align:start position:0%
extent to which we say that any business
 
00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:33.480 align:start position:0%
interest or industry should Simply Be
 
00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:35.640 align:start position:0%
regulating itself and when we're talking
 
00:18:37.730 --> 00:18:37.740 align:start position:0%
about communities of various sizes
 
00:18:40.490 --> 00:18:40.500 align:start position:0%
communities that may not have more than
 
00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:42.360 align:start position:0%
one or maybe two I don't know we'd have
 
00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
to look at it right uh facilities that
 
00:18:47.090 --> 00:18:47.100 align:start position:0%
offer these kinds of services your your
 
00:18:49.370 --> 00:18:49.380 align:start position:0%
choices are limited right and we're also
 
00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:51.480 align:start position:0%
talking about a variety of price ranges
 
00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:54.360 align:start position:0%
and people who can afford uh to pay a
 
00:18:56.930 --> 00:18:56.940 align:start position:0%
higher price for services or more likely
 
00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
I would assume to get a quality of care
 
00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:01.860 align:start position:0%
that may not be available I'm not
 
00:19:04.250 --> 00:19:04.260 align:start position:0%
presuming to to prejudge that but may
 
00:19:05.810 --> 00:19:05.820 align:start position:0%
not be available at places where you
 
00:19:07.370 --> 00:19:07.380 align:start position:0%
don't have
 
00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
um uh where the the price for the
 
00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:13.140 align:start position:0%
services is lower so uh I I wanted to to
 
00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:16.260 align:start position:0%
add that act as a is something for us to
 
00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:17.880 align:start position:0%
think about as well right when we're not
 
00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:19.860 align:start position:0%
saying that this applies to the vast
 
00:19:23.210 --> 00:19:23.220 align:start position:0%
majority of of uh places that offer
 
00:19:25.610 --> 00:19:25.620 align:start position:0%
these services but if these concerns
 
00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:28.020 align:start position:0%
exist for even a percentage of that it's
 
00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:30.480 align:start position:0%
still a significant number of pets and
 
00:19:32.450 --> 00:19:32.460 align:start position:0%
granite Staters who are affected and and
 
00:19:34.850 --> 00:19:34.860 align:start position:0%
as I said I think it's entirely Goodwill
 
00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
in their philosophical differences as I
 
00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:39.000 align:start position:0%
said about the faith that some of us
 
00:19:40.669 --> 00:19:40.679 align:start position:0%
have that the free market is simply
 
00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:43.860 align:start position:0%
going to regulate itself on uh behalf of
 
00:19:46.490 --> 00:19:46.500 align:start position:0%
the interests of people
 
00:19:49.370 --> 00:19:49.380 align:start position:0%
and pets
 
00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:50.690 align:start position:0%
and pets
okay

00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:50.700 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
all right I think we've kind of
 
00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
put that uh
 
00:19:58.909 --> 00:19:58.919 align:start position:0%
all those ideas together and uh we can
 
00:20:02.210 --> 00:20:02.220 align:start position:0%
move forward to the next bill if that is
 
00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:05.340 align:start position:0%
uh okay with everybody
 
00:20:10.210 --> 00:20:10.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:13.370 --> 00:20:13.380 align:start position:0%
so so you would you would work on doing
 
00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:17.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:20.570 --> 00:20:20.580 align:start position:0%
bring thank you
 
00:20:22.010 --> 00:20:22.020 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
um moving on to hb122
 
00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:27.960 align:start position:0%
relative to micro Enterprise home
 
00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:30.440 align:start position:0%
kitchen operations
 
00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:33.240 align:start position:0%
I believe representative comtwa would
 
00:20:35.810 --> 00:20:35.820 align:start position:0%
like to speak to this
 
00:20:38.029 --> 00:20:38.039 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair
 
00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:40.140 align:start position:0%
um I would like to have the opportunity
 
00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:43.140 align:start position:0%
to bring forth an amendment uh because
 
00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:45.720 align:start position:0%
some of the information already
 
00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
in this bill has already been passed uh
 
00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:50.820 align:start position:0%
expect you know especially where it
 
00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
talks about maximum gross sales we've
 
00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
actually eliminated that dollar amount
 
00:20:57.650 --> 00:20:57.660 align:start position:0%
so there do need to be some changes in
 
00:21:01.669 --> 00:21:01.679 align:start position:0%
there and I would really like to have an
 
00:21:03.169 --> 00:21:03.179 align:start position:0%
opportunity to present an amendment to
 
00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
the committee in the next few weeks if
 
00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:07.750 align:start position:0%
the committee in the next few weeks if
possible

00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
possible
 
00:21:12.049 --> 00:21:12.059 align:start position:0%
anyone else have any comments on that
 
00:21:12.059 --> 00:21:13.730 align:start position:0%
anyone else have any comments on that
okay

00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:13.740 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:21:16.789 --> 00:21:16.799 align:start position:0%
representative Creighton and just just a
 
00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:19.320 align:start position:0%
question and so exactly what would you
 
00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:21.720 align:start position:0%
be looking to that Amendment what would
 
00:21:23.150 --> 00:21:23.160 align:start position:0%
it look like
 
00:21:25.370 --> 00:21:25.380 align:start position:0%
um I'm looking at an amendment
 
00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
um and I went to Montana and to look at
 
00:21:31.789 --> 00:21:31.799 align:start position:0%
micros Enterprise home kitchen
 
00:21:35.450 --> 00:21:35.460 align:start position:0%
operations where a person could sell to
 
00:21:37.850 --> 00:21:37.860 align:start position:0%
an informed and the key word there is an
 
00:21:41.289 --> 00:21:41.299 align:start position:0%
informed and consumer uh any product
 
00:21:46.190 --> 00:21:46.200 align:start position:0%
without labeling or package you know and
 
00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:47.400 align:start position:0%
that way
 
00:21:49.850 --> 00:21:49.860 align:start position:0%
we could have mitigated what happened up
 
00:21:51.649 --> 00:21:51.659 align:start position:0%
in Meredith where they had the cease and
 
00:21:51.659 --> 00:21:52.730 align:start position:0%
in Meredith where they had the cease and
desist

00:21:52.730 --> 00:21:52.740 align:start position:0%
desist
 
00:21:54.890 --> 00:21:54.900 align:start position:0%
um with regards to donating food to help
 
00:21:56.750 --> 00:21:56.760 align:start position:0%
people that didn't have any means of
 
00:21:59.690 --> 00:21:59.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:01.370 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:22:01.370 --> 00:22:01.380 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:02.960 align:start position:0%
any other discussion on this
 
00:22:06.830 --> 00:22:06.840 align:start position:0%
representative Murray uh yeah um the
 
00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:06.950 align:start position:0%
representative Murray uh yeah um the
um

00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:10.430 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:10.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:12.600 align:start position:0%
knowing that the particular details of
 
00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:16.740 align:start position:0%
what are what transpired fully up in uh
 
00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:18.480 align:start position:0%
Meredith like you mentioned I do know
 
00:22:21.409 --> 00:22:21.419 align:start position:0%
that like the Good Samaritan act like
 
00:22:24.770 --> 00:22:24.780 align:start position:0%
does cover certain donations and so to
 
00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
that end I also am curious about what
 
00:22:29.570 --> 00:22:29.580 align:start position:0%
the definition of informed consumer
 
00:22:31.850 --> 00:22:31.860 align:start position:0%
would be and so how would you determine
 
00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:32.930 align:start position:0%
would be and so how would you determine
what

00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:32.940 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:22:34.370 --> 00:22:34.380 align:start position:0%
consumer would be
 
00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:36.240 align:start position:0%
um I don't have the definition in front
 
00:22:38.690 --> 00:22:38.700 align:start position:0%
of me but in an informed end consumer
 
00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:43.320 align:start position:0%
would be a person that is aware that the
 
00:22:45.770 --> 00:22:45.780 align:start position:0%
person selling the product is not
 
00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:47.750 align:start position:0%
person selling the product is not
licensed

00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
licensed
 
00:22:51.529 --> 00:22:51.539 align:start position:0%
that the kitchen has not been inspected
 
00:22:54.289 --> 00:22:54.299 align:start position:0%
and that they're buying it
 
00:22:58.490 --> 00:22:58.500 align:start position:0%
um with conversation with the person
 
00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:01.320 align:start position:0%
selling that product what's in it and
 
00:23:03.169 --> 00:23:03.179 align:start position:0%
have a conversation they would be
 
00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:05.400 align:start position:0%
completely informed and they would have
 
00:23:08.270 --> 00:23:08.280 align:start position:0%
the option to choose whether to buy or
 
00:23:10.370 --> 00:23:10.380 align:start position:0%
not to buy
 
00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:14.950 align:start position:0%
not to buy
foreign

00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:17.280 align:start position:0%
Murray uh thank you madam chair follow
 
00:23:20.090 --> 00:23:20.100 align:start position:0%
up if I may sure okay thank you
 
00:23:22.370 --> 00:23:22.380 align:start position:0%
um to that end is there um have you
 
00:23:24.529 --> 00:23:24.539 align:start position:0%
talked with anybody in like sort of the
 
00:23:27.710 --> 00:23:27.720 align:start position:0%
legal end of things like informed
 
00:23:29.450 --> 00:23:29.460 align:start position:0%
consumer could mean many things and in
 
00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:31.260 align:start position:0%
the event that
 
00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
um some sort of harm or damage would
 
00:23:35.029 --> 00:23:35.039 align:start position:0%
happen as a result of an uninspected
 
00:23:35.039 --> 00:23:36.649 align:start position:0%
happen as a result of an uninspected
product

00:23:36.649 --> 00:23:36.659 align:start position:0%
product
 
00:23:37.909 --> 00:23:37.919 align:start position:0%
um what
 
00:23:40.430 --> 00:23:40.440 align:start position:0%
what could happen uh if there was
 
00:23:43.310 --> 00:23:43.320 align:start position:0%
serious illness or some other thing that
 
00:23:44.690 --> 00:23:44.700 align:start position:0%
that's something that
 
00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:46.440 align:start position:0%
would be considered in the potential
 
00:23:49.130 --> 00:23:49.140 align:start position:0%
legislation representative you may reply
 
00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and I apologize
 
00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:54.240 align:start position:0%
for not raising my hair no worries
 
00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:55.250 align:start position:0%
for not raising my hair no worries
um

00:23:55.250 --> 00:23:55.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:59.930 --> 00:23:59.940 align:start position:0%
we already have legislation not using
 
00:24:03.169 --> 00:24:03.179 align:start position:0%
the word informed and consumer but we
 
00:24:06.409 --> 00:24:06.419 align:start position:0%
have legislation where you can have a
 
00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
homestead license that is uninspected
 
00:24:10.610 --> 00:24:10.620 align:start position:0%
the difference is is that you have to
 
00:24:14.149 --> 00:24:14.159 align:start position:0%
have a label on it we have raw milk
 
00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:16.880 align:start position:0%
products that are from uninspected
 
00:24:20.210 --> 00:24:20.220 align:start position:0%
facilities you just have to have a note
 
00:24:22.850 --> 00:24:22.860 align:start position:0%
saying that it is from an uninspected
 
00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:23.870 align:start position:0%
saying that it is from an uninspected
facility

00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:23.880 align:start position:0%
facility
 
00:24:27.289 --> 00:24:27.299 align:start position:0%
so we already have a precedence
 
00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:34.190 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:24:34.190 --> 00:24:34.200 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:36.720 align:start position:0%
representative good morning good morning
 
00:24:39.890 --> 00:24:39.900 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair okay I'm going to
 
00:24:42.890 --> 00:24:42.900 align:start position:0%
have my ignorance on display here
 
00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:44.460 align:start position:0%
um because I don't know a lot about this
 
00:24:47.169 --> 00:24:47.179 align:start position:0%
area but for example the other day
 
00:24:49.669 --> 00:24:49.679 align:start position:0%
one of our colleagues was you know
 
00:24:49.679 --> 00:24:51.110 align:start position:0%
one of our colleagues was you know
selling

00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
selling
 
00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:53.940 align:start position:0%
um honey out of the back of his truck I
 
00:24:55.549 --> 00:24:55.559 align:start position:0%
bought it didn't even think about it it
 
00:24:58.610 --> 00:24:58.620 align:start position:0%
was fine so I'm I'm assuming that we
 
00:25:02.750 --> 00:25:02.760 align:start position:0%
have a a lot of people who do backyard
 
00:25:05.390 --> 00:25:05.400 align:start position:0%
things and maybe they make you know 20
 
00:25:08.510 --> 00:25:08.520 align:start position:0%
or 30 Jam things
 
00:25:11.029 --> 00:25:11.039 align:start position:0%
um how is that regulated now is it not
 
00:25:11.039 --> 00:25:12.590 align:start position:0%
um how is that regulated now is it not
regulated

00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
regulated
 
00:25:14.990 --> 00:25:15.000 align:start position:0%
um how do we handle it in law
 
00:25:16.909 --> 00:25:16.919 align:start position:0%
representative Compton
 
00:25:19.370 --> 00:25:19.380 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:21.710 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
so

00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:21.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
as we heard in previous testimony and
 
00:25:25.850 --> 00:25:25.860 align:start position:0%
the reason we eliminated the gross sales
 
00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:29.340 align:start position:0%
dollar amount from DHHS was that they
 
00:25:32.690 --> 00:25:32.700 align:start position:0%
don't inspect or regulate it at all
 
00:25:36.049 --> 00:25:36.059 align:start position:0%
so that is the short answer
 
00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:39.000 align:start position:0%
representative Murray uh thank you madam
 
00:25:41.570 --> 00:25:41.580 align:start position:0%
chair at one point of clarification
 
00:25:43.970 --> 00:25:43.980 align:start position:0%
um I do believe that there is within
 
00:25:46.130 --> 00:25:46.140 align:start position:0%
DHHS and Homestead licensure there are
 
00:25:47.930 --> 00:25:47.940 align:start position:0%
certain products that can and cannot be
 
00:25:49.970 --> 00:25:49.980 align:start position:0%
produced to be under Homestead licensure
 
00:25:53.090 --> 00:25:53.100 align:start position:0%
and it depends on uh bacteria certain
 
00:25:54.950 --> 00:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
things that may or may not grow in them
 
00:25:57.830 --> 00:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
and there is a list of products
 
00:26:00.289 --> 00:26:00.299 align:start position:0%
representative thank you madam chair
 
00:26:02.269 --> 00:26:02.279 align:start position:0%
that is absolutely correct this would
 
00:26:03.950 --> 00:26:03.960 align:start position:0%
not fall under the homestead licensure
 
00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:06.409 align:start position:0%
not fall under the homestead licensure
Act

00:26:06.409 --> 00:26:06.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:08.340 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby you had your hand
 
00:26:09.529 --> 00:26:09.539 align:start position:0%
up yes
 
00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:12.480 align:start position:0%
uh I just wanted to point out that um
 
00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:14.760 align:start position:0%
on page three of the bill that we have
 
00:26:18.169 --> 00:26:18.179 align:start position:0%
in front of us uh the current definition
 
00:26:20.330 --> 00:26:20.340 align:start position:0%
is actually there a homestead food
 
00:26:22.570 --> 00:26:22.580 align:start position:0%
operation means
 
00:26:25.610 --> 00:26:25.620 align:start position:0%
what it struck out a person who produces
 
00:26:27.769 --> 00:26:27.779 align:start position:0%
Homestead food products excluding
 
00:26:30.010 --> 00:26:30.020 align:start position:0%
excluding potentially hazardous food
 
00:26:32.390 --> 00:26:32.400 align:start position:0%
only in the home kitchen of that
 
00:26:35.269 --> 00:26:35.279 align:start position:0%
person's primary residence so
 
00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:39.240 align:start position:0%
um the current uh exam the car the
 
00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:42.240 align:start position:0%
things that you're currently able to uh
 
00:26:44.630 --> 00:26:44.640 align:start position:0%
produce on that using that homestead
 
00:26:46.549 --> 00:26:46.559 align:start position:0%
exemption are things that you produce
 
00:26:49.610 --> 00:26:49.620 align:start position:0%
exclusively in your home and it has to
 
00:26:51.470 --> 00:26:51.480 align:start position:0%
and it can't be potentially hazardous
 
00:26:53.810 --> 00:26:53.820 align:start position:0%
food and there is a definition of
 
00:26:57.710 --> 00:26:57.720 align:start position:0%
potentially hazardous food on the uh the
 
00:27:03.950 --> 00:27:03.960 align:start position:0%
um on the HHS web uh website that um
 
00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:07.520 align:start position:0%
that but essentially uh
 
00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:12.120 align:start position:0%
jams and jellies honey maple syrup uh
 
00:27:13.909 --> 00:27:13.919 align:start position:0%
all fall under the non-hazardous
 
00:27:13.919 --> 00:27:15.769 align:start position:0%
all fall under the non-hazardous
category

00:27:15.769 --> 00:27:15.779 align:start position:0%
category
 
00:27:17.090 --> 00:27:17.100 align:start position:0%
um things that are fermented like
 
00:27:21.230 --> 00:27:21.240 align:start position:0%
pickles are not considered uh are not
 
00:27:22.610 --> 00:27:22.620 align:start position:0%
allowed in the
 
00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:25.320 align:start position:0%
um in the non-hazardous anything that is
 
00:27:28.970 --> 00:27:28.980 align:start position:0%
dairy is is an animal product other than
 
00:27:32.570 --> 00:27:32.580 align:start position:0%
I think uh fresh eggs are would be
 
00:27:35.990 --> 00:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
considered on not part of the that
 
00:27:40.730 --> 00:27:40.740 align:start position:0%
exemption uh so uh there are
 
00:27:43.850 --> 00:27:43.860 align:start position:0%
um and you can uh so there basically
 
00:27:46.970 --> 00:27:46.980 align:start position:0%
anything that has the potential of uh
 
00:27:49.549 --> 00:27:49.559 align:start position:0%
going bad quickly would be considered a
 
00:27:54.169 --> 00:27:54.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:57.890 --> 00:27:57.900 align:start position:0%
and so you can and there's no there's no
 
00:28:01.010 --> 00:28:01.020 align:start position:0%
regulation if you are selling jams and
 
00:28:02.570 --> 00:28:02.580 align:start position:0%
jellies and that sort of thing other
 
00:28:04.490 --> 00:28:04.500 align:start position:0%
than other than I think there are I
 
00:28:06.230 --> 00:28:06.240 align:start position:0%
think there is a labeling requirement
 
00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
but beyond that uh beyond that uh it is
 
00:28:12.049 --> 00:28:12.059 align:start position:0%
there's a fair amount of freedom in that
 
00:28:14.210 --> 00:28:14.220 align:start position:0%
regard already
 
00:28:17.269 --> 00:28:17.279 align:start position:0%
all right well thank you
 
00:28:20.390 --> 00:28:20.400 align:start position:0%
so I I suppose
 
00:28:23.269 --> 00:28:23.279 align:start position:0%
with any of these retained bills
 
00:28:25.850 --> 00:28:25.860 align:start position:0%
um if anybody is working on an amendment
 
00:28:27.370 --> 00:28:27.380 align:start position:0%
to them
 
00:28:30.590 --> 00:28:30.600 align:start position:0%
within the next couple of weeks I would
 
00:28:32.810 --> 00:28:32.820 align:start position:0%
expect that the amendment would be
 
00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
drafted and shared with the committee so
 
00:28:37.510 --> 00:28:37.520 align:start position:0%
that we would have all the information
 
00:28:40.610 --> 00:28:40.620 align:start position:0%
needed when we come back to do the exec
 
00:28:42.110 --> 00:28:42.120 align:start position:0%
on these bills
 
00:28:46.850 --> 00:28:46.860 align:start position:0%
and also to recognize that um if the
 
00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:48.710 align:start position:0%
and also to recognize that um if the
bill

00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:48.720 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:28:50.690 --> 00:28:50.700 align:start position:0%
is passed through the committee with an
 
00:28:52.610 --> 00:28:52.620 align:start position:0%
amendment and it goes to the house floor
 
00:28:54.289 --> 00:28:54.299 align:start position:0%
there's still a vote that has to happen
 
00:28:56.990 --> 00:28:57.000 align:start position:0%
with that and then it would go on to the
 
00:29:00.110 --> 00:29:00.120 align:start position:0%
Senate as well so you know
 
00:29:03.649 --> 00:29:03.659 align:start position:0%
we have to still be mindful of the
 
00:29:06.289 --> 00:29:06.299 align:start position:0%
procedure for for how this is going to
 
00:29:08.090 --> 00:29:08.100 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
00:29:09.950 --> 00:29:09.960 align:start position:0%
any other comment on this particular
 
00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:11.450 align:start position:0%
any other comment on this particular
bill

00:29:11.450 --> 00:29:11.460 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:12.850 align:start position:0%
bill
no

00:29:12.850 --> 00:29:12.860 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:29:14.930 --> 00:29:14.940 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
00:29:18.889 --> 00:29:18.899 align:start position:0%
let's move on to our next bill
 
00:29:21.950 --> 00:29:21.960 align:start position:0%
HB 326 prohibiting the use of second
 
00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:24.840 align:start position:0%
generation anticoagulant rodenticides
 
00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:27.360 align:start position:0%
and I would particularly draw your
 
00:29:29.049 --> 00:29:29.059 align:start position:0%
attention to
 
00:29:33.529 --> 00:29:33.539 align:start position:0%
a preliminary report that was sent to us
 
00:29:36.730 --> 00:29:36.740 align:start position:0%
from the pesticide review board
 
00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
which it was sent electronically I do
 
00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
have a hard copy here with me and we
 
00:29:45.289 --> 00:29:45.299 align:start position:0%
have the pleasure of Mr Rousseau joining
 
00:29:48.049 --> 00:29:48.059 align:start position:0%
us today if we have any questions for Mr
 
00:29:50.990 --> 00:29:51.000 align:start position:0%
Russo from the pesticide review board I
 
00:29:52.250 --> 00:29:52.260 align:start position:0%
would encourage
 
00:29:56.450 --> 00:29:56.460 align:start position:0%
um your questions as a result of the
 
00:29:59.750 --> 00:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
preliminary report and with respect to
 
00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:03.120 align:start position:0%
the language in this bill so who would
 
00:30:06.529 --> 00:30:06.539 align:start position:0%
like to start off the conversation
 
00:30:08.450 --> 00:30:08.460 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby
 
00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
yeah so
 
00:30:13.250 --> 00:30:13.260 align:start position:0%
um having read through the uh the
 
00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:14.640 align:start position:0%
preliminary report
 
00:30:17.389 --> 00:30:17.399 align:start position:0%
um I've uh was looking at the
 
00:30:20.210 --> 00:30:20.220 align:start position:0%
recommendations in section e on page 10.
 
00:30:22.789 --> 00:30:22.799 align:start position:0%
I think we all have this in on our in
 
00:30:24.049 --> 00:30:24.059 align:start position:0%
front of us so if you want to take a
 
00:30:25.310 --> 00:30:25.320 align:start position:0%
look at that
 
00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:26.630 align:start position:0%
look at that
um

00:30:26.630 --> 00:30:26.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:30.289 --> 00:30:30.299 align:start position:0%
one so uh one of the the second
 
00:30:33.169 --> 00:30:33.179 align:start position:0%
recommendation on that list is consider
 
00:30:35.029 --> 00:30:35.039 align:start position:0%
product label revision to identify
 
00:30:37.010 --> 00:30:37.020 align:start position:0%
state-specific restriction of second
 
00:30:39.649 --> 00:30:39.659 align:start position:0%
generation anticoagulant regenicide
 
00:30:42.350 --> 00:30:42.360 align:start position:0%
contingent on epa's final decision
 
00:30:44.810 --> 00:30:44.820 align:start position:0%
for example certain pesticide label
 
00:30:47.090 --> 00:30:47.100 align:start position:0%
instructions restrict use in particular
 
00:30:49.850 --> 00:30:49.860 align:start position:0%
States Beyond EPA requirements this may
 
00:30:51.289 --> 00:30:51.299 align:start position:0%
be considered for second generation
 
00:30:54.049 --> 00:30:54.059 align:start position:0%
anticoagulants and so
 
00:30:56.269 --> 00:30:56.279 align:start position:0%
um that's that's essentially a follow-up
 
00:30:57.889 --> 00:30:57.899 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
00:30:59.750 --> 00:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
what's mentioned in the report which is
 
00:31:03.490 --> 00:31:03.500 align:start position:0%
that the EPA is really looking into
 
00:31:07.370 --> 00:31:07.380 align:start position:0%
creating uh restricted use category for
 
00:31:10.909 --> 00:31:10.919 align:start position:0%
these products and uh
 
00:31:17.930 --> 00:31:17.940 align:start position:0%
the so uh I think that the uh there's an
 
00:31:20.389 --> 00:31:20.399 align:start position:0%
based on the epa's movement in that
 
00:31:22.490 --> 00:31:22.500 align:start position:0%
direction based on what we heard in
 
00:31:27.470 --> 00:31:27.480 align:start position:0%
testimony uh uh last spring and based on
 
00:31:30.889 --> 00:31:30.899 align:start position:0%
the the information on in this report
 
00:31:33.169 --> 00:31:33.179 align:start position:0%
that indicates that uh there are a
 
00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
number of wildlife species in New
 
00:31:39.470 --> 00:31:39.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that have been showing uh the
 
00:31:44.210 --> 00:31:44.220 align:start position:0%
presence of uh these anti-anticoagulants
 
00:31:46.130 --> 00:31:46.140 align:start position:0%
um insofar as they can be tested and
 
00:31:49.490 --> 00:31:49.500 align:start position:0%
testing is testing Wildlife is is a very
 
00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:51.840 align:start position:0%
is a much more challenging process than
 
00:31:55.610 --> 00:31:55.620 align:start position:0%
testing uh testing farm animals so it's
 
00:31:58.130 --> 00:31:58.140 align:start position:0%
much harder to get the data uh so
 
00:32:00.049 --> 00:32:00.059 align:start position:0%
insofar as there is data it says that
 
00:32:02.870 --> 00:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
this stuff is out there I think that it
 
00:32:06.950 --> 00:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
would be a sensible approach to make
 
00:32:09.110 --> 00:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
sure that the people who are using these
 
00:32:12.049 --> 00:32:12.059 align:start position:0%
products know how to use them and uh
 
00:32:15.769 --> 00:32:15.779 align:start position:0%
that so I would suggest that we
 
00:32:20.389 --> 00:32:20.399 align:start position:0%
uh revive amend the bill to say that to
 
00:32:23.930 --> 00:32:23.940 align:start position:0%
recommend to the uh pesticide control
 
00:32:26.149 --> 00:32:26.159 align:start position:0%
board that they use their existing
 
00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
rulemaking uh Power to make these uh
 
00:32:36.250 --> 00:32:36.260 align:start position:0%
um restricted use in New Hampshire and
 
00:32:41.210 --> 00:32:41.220 align:start position:0%
uh and if that you know if any if
 
00:32:43.549 --> 00:32:43.559 align:start position:0%
Federal Regulations come down soon
 
00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:46.320 align:start position:0%
enough to make that you know Superfluous
 
00:32:50.090 --> 00:32:50.100 align:start position:0%
great uh but if the potential government
 
00:32:51.710 --> 00:32:51.720 align:start position:0%
shutdown that they're talking about
 
00:32:54.769 --> 00:32:54.779 align:start position:0%
happens in uh at the end of September
 
00:32:56.450 --> 00:32:56.460 align:start position:0%
and we don't know how long that's going
 
00:32:58.909 --> 00:32:58.919 align:start position:0%
to last because we know how things fail
 
00:33:01.610 --> 00:33:01.620 align:start position:0%
to work sometimes in Washington then the
 
00:33:04.669 --> 00:33:04.679 align:start position:0%
EPA may end up being very you know
 
00:33:07.570 --> 00:33:07.580 align:start position:0%
substantially delayed in being able to
 
00:33:10.730 --> 00:33:10.740 align:start position:0%
uh finalize this rule that they're
 
00:33:13.310 --> 00:33:13.320 align:start position:0%
proposing so and I don't think that we
 
00:33:15.769 --> 00:33:15.779 align:start position:0%
should continue to put our wildlife
 
00:33:18.110 --> 00:33:18.120 align:start position:0%
Jeopardy during that period so I think
 
00:33:21.049 --> 00:33:21.059 align:start position:0%
that we should as a as a step to protect
 
00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:25.200 align:start position:0%
our state wildlife uh say we will we
 
00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:26.029 align:start position:0%
our state wildlife uh say we will we
will

00:33:26.029 --> 00:33:26.039 align:start position:0%
will
 
00:33:27.769 --> 00:33:27.779 align:start position:0%
make it restricted use in New Hampshire
 
00:33:30.710 --> 00:33:30.720 align:start position:0%
and If the Fed when the if and when the
 
00:33:33.169 --> 00:33:33.179 align:start position:0%
feds come down with their final rule we
 
00:33:35.509 --> 00:33:35.519 align:start position:0%
will then make sure that our rules are
 
00:33:37.669 --> 00:33:37.679 align:start position:0%
consistent with their rules
 
00:33:39.649 --> 00:33:39.659 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Bixby my own
 
00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
thoughts on this are
 
00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:42.889 align:start position:0%
thoughts on this are
um

00:33:42.889 --> 00:33:42.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:47.330 --> 00:33:47.340 align:start position:0%
I haven't seen any reports for that that
 
00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
actually show numbers or any kind of
 
00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:55.490 align:start position:0%
actually show numbers or any kind of
definitive

00:33:55.490 --> 00:33:55.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:56.450 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:33:56.450 --> 00:33:56.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:00.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:02.450 --> 00:34:02.460 align:start position:0%
that these
 
00:34:02.460 --> 00:34:05.149 align:start position:0%
that these
rodenticides

00:34:05.149 --> 00:34:05.159 align:start position:0%
rodenticides
 
00:34:07.370 --> 00:34:07.380 align:start position:0%
have absolutely
 
00:34:07.380 --> 00:34:08.869 align:start position:0%
have absolutely
caused

00:34:08.869 --> 00:34:08.879 align:start position:0%
caused
 
00:34:10.730 --> 00:34:10.740 align:start position:0%
a negative
 
00:34:10.740 --> 00:34:11.930 align:start position:0%
a negative
um

00:34:11.930 --> 00:34:11.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:15.050 --> 00:34:15.060 align:start position:0%
circumstances with our Predator
 
00:34:18.349 --> 00:34:18.359 align:start position:0%
population I mean I haven't seen that
 
00:34:20.750 --> 00:34:20.760 align:start position:0%
there is a decrease of our Predator
 
00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:21.849 align:start position:0%
there is a decrease of our Predator
population

00:34:21.849 --> 00:34:21.859 align:start position:0%
population
 
00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:25.740 align:start position:0%
directly tied or as a result of the use
 
00:34:27.710 --> 00:34:27.720 align:start position:0%
of these pesticides
 
00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:29.690 align:start position:0%
of these pesticides
and

00:34:29.690 --> 00:34:29.700 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:34:32.629 --> 00:34:32.639 align:start position:0%
um I know that might be hard to obtain
 
00:34:35.210 --> 00:34:35.220 align:start position:0%
that kind of data
 
00:34:38.089 --> 00:34:38.099 align:start position:0%
but we have to look at the the fact that
 
00:34:41.329 --> 00:34:41.339 align:start position:0%
if we are restricting use
 
00:34:43.550 --> 00:34:43.560 align:start position:0%
then what that is doing is that is
 
00:34:46.750 --> 00:34:46.760 align:start position:0%
pushing the homeowner to employ
 
00:34:49.430 --> 00:34:49.440 align:start position:0%
Professional Services
 
00:34:53.210 --> 00:34:53.220 align:start position:0%
to deal with a rat or mice mouse or
 
00:34:54.950 --> 00:34:54.960 align:start position:0%
rodent problem that they may have in
 
00:34:57.290 --> 00:34:57.300 align:start position:0%
their home in their Farm wherever
 
00:34:59.630 --> 00:34:59.640 align:start position:0%
their business
 
00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:00.770 align:start position:0%
their business
um

00:35:00.770 --> 00:35:00.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:02.640 align:start position:0%
and I have
 
00:35:05.690 --> 00:35:05.700 align:start position:0%
I'm kind of torn with this because
 
00:35:07.430 --> 00:35:07.440 align:start position:0%
um yeah it'll certainly don't want
 
00:35:10.190 --> 00:35:10.200 align:start position:0%
people to be purchasing buckets of this
 
00:35:13.370 --> 00:35:13.380 align:start position:0%
stuff and just tossing it wherever there
 
00:35:16.370 --> 00:35:16.380 align:start position:0%
should be some not some education some
 
00:35:18.829 --> 00:35:18.839 align:start position:0%
knowledge of of how to properly use
 
00:35:20.870 --> 00:35:20.880 align:start position:0%
these substances
 
00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:23.640 align:start position:0%
but by the same token
 
00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:24.250 align:start position:0%
but by the same token
um

00:35:24.250 --> 00:35:24.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:27.410 --> 00:35:27.420 align:start position:0%
we're here um at least for me I'm I'm
 
00:35:29.329 --> 00:35:29.339 align:start position:0%
thinking I'm only hearing anecdotal
 
00:35:32.270 --> 00:35:32.280 align:start position:0%
evidence from rehabbers or or
 
00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:33.290 align:start position:0%
evidence from rehabbers or or
um

00:35:33.290 --> 00:35:33.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:36.109 --> 00:35:36.119 align:start position:0%
Wildlife organizations
 
00:35:39.370 --> 00:35:39.380 align:start position:0%
of certain instances where they've found
 
00:35:44.450 --> 00:35:44.460 align:start position:0%
uh poison Predators so I'm kind of I'm
 
00:35:46.849 --> 00:35:46.859 align:start position:0%
kind of mixed on this so representative
 
00:35:46.859 --> 00:35:48.170 align:start position:0%
kind of mixed on this so representative
Murray

00:35:48.170 --> 00:35:48.180 align:start position:0%
Murray
 
00:35:50.690 --> 00:35:50.700 align:start position:0%
yeah thanks Madam chair um I do have
 
00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
some questions that I think maybe you
 
00:35:54.109 --> 00:35:54.119 align:start position:0%
all at the department could speak to so
 
00:35:56.329 --> 00:35:56.339 align:start position:0%
certainly I invite you to the microphone
 
00:35:58.490 --> 00:35:58.500 align:start position:0%
Mr Russo
 
00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
one of the things that I'm curious about
 
00:36:03.170 --> 00:36:03.180 align:start position:0%
is the Bobcat study that's listed
 
00:36:06.650 --> 00:36:06.660 align:start position:0%
through SUNY SUNY I'm just that's is
 
00:36:10.370 --> 00:36:10.380 align:start position:0%
that New York yeah okay so um I'm
 
00:36:12.710 --> 00:36:12.720 align:start position:0%
curious about that data and and before
 
00:36:14.630 --> 00:36:14.640 align:start position:0%
we get into that I also just wanted to
 
00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:16.200 align:start position:0%
mention I think in the previous hearing
 
00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:18.720 align:start position:0%
of my member my memory serves me
 
00:36:21.470 --> 00:36:21.480 align:start position:0%
correctly we did talk about
 
00:36:23.450 --> 00:36:23.460 align:start position:0%
um some concerns about some of these
 
00:36:25.250 --> 00:36:25.260 align:start position:0%
things being widely available in large
 
00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:26.990 align:start position:0%
things being widely available in large
quantities

00:36:26.990 --> 00:36:27.000 align:start position:0%
quantities
 
00:36:30.349 --> 00:36:30.359 align:start position:0%
um and um also available online in large
 
00:36:30.359 --> 00:36:32.210 align:start position:0%
um and um also available online in large
quantities

00:36:32.210 --> 00:36:32.220 align:start position:0%
quantities
 
00:36:34.190 --> 00:36:34.200 align:start position:0%
um and to which end I think
 
00:36:36.290 --> 00:36:36.300 align:start position:0%
um there has to be some discussion I
 
00:36:38.930 --> 00:36:38.940 align:start position:0%
think around the availability of some of
 
00:36:41.870 --> 00:36:41.880 align:start position:0%
these products in um
 
00:36:44.270 --> 00:36:44.280 align:start position:0%
to the general public in that amount and
 
00:36:46.670 --> 00:36:46.680 align:start position:0%
I I think part of the discussion
 
00:36:49.550 --> 00:36:49.560 align:start position:0%
was about how do we monitor that how
 
00:36:51.530 --> 00:36:51.540 align:start position:0%
does that how is what oversight
 
00:36:53.690 --> 00:36:53.700 align:start position:0%
mechanism would there be to potentially
 
00:36:55.849 --> 00:36:55.859 align:start position:0%
limit that so the first part is with the
 
00:36:58.310 --> 00:36:58.320 align:start position:0%
Bobcat study I'd like to talk touch on
 
00:37:00.170 --> 00:37:00.180 align:start position:0%
that and then talk about maybe next
 
00:37:02.510 --> 00:37:02.520 align:start position:0%
steps or other measures that we could
 
00:37:06.470 --> 00:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
do for personal use purchasing
 
00:37:08.690 --> 00:37:08.700 align:start position:0%
okay uh David Rousseau with New
 
00:37:09.890 --> 00:37:09.900 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Agriculture
 
00:37:12.770 --> 00:37:12.780 align:start position:0%
markets and food in regard to the Bobcat
 
00:37:15.890 --> 00:37:15.900 align:start position:0%
study and I'm one of of 10 of the folks
 
00:37:17.569 --> 00:37:17.579 align:start position:0%
that were on task force and I know there
 
00:37:18.770 --> 00:37:18.780 align:start position:0%
are other people here so if I miss
 
00:37:20.510 --> 00:37:20.520 align:start position:0%
something I just want to make that point
 
00:37:23.210 --> 00:37:23.220 align:start position:0%
and someone can fill in the gaps but the
 
00:37:25.550 --> 00:37:25.560 align:start position:0%
um the Bobcat study was part of a a
 
00:37:28.730 --> 00:37:28.740 align:start position:0%
study from New Hampshire University New
 
00:37:30.230 --> 00:37:30.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Diagnostic lab and it was
 
00:37:32.569 --> 00:37:32.579 align:start position:0%
actually to study distemper and wild
 
00:37:35.750 --> 00:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
animals bobcat being one of them
 
00:37:38.150 --> 00:37:38.160 align:start position:0%
um and they were able to wrap in a
 
00:37:40.550 --> 00:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
couple other studies to that distemper
 
00:37:42.530 --> 00:37:42.540 align:start position:0%
study and one of them was what is the
 
00:37:45.290 --> 00:37:45.300 align:start position:0%
residue of rodenticides and wild animals
 
00:37:47.990 --> 00:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
and so Trappers would provide the uh the
 
00:37:49.430 --> 00:37:49.440 align:start position:0%
livers of these animals that they would
 
00:37:51.050 --> 00:37:51.060 align:start position:0%
trap and that's really the only way you
 
00:37:54.589 --> 00:37:54.599 align:start position:0%
can identify the um the rodenticide and
 
00:37:57.170 --> 00:37:57.180 align:start position:0%
it's and it's uh lethal impact to an
 
00:37:59.030 --> 00:37:59.040 align:start position:0%
animal so that's that's how that that
 
00:38:00.829 --> 00:38:00.839 align:start position:0%
study I think that was a question and it
 
00:38:02.750 --> 00:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
actually includes um
 
00:38:04.970 --> 00:38:04.980 align:start position:0%
for more New York and New Hampshire
 
00:38:08.150 --> 00:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
animals and yes there is residue in
 
00:38:10.670 --> 00:38:10.680 align:start position:0%
Wildlife that that's not um that's a
 
00:38:13.069 --> 00:38:13.079 align:start position:0%
question that is the answer is yes
 
00:38:15.530 --> 00:38:15.540 align:start position:0%
um to what extent the impact is that
 
00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:17.280 align:start position:0%
that's that's the question now and I
 
00:38:20.210 --> 00:38:20.220 align:start position:0%
think that the reason why the task force
 
00:38:22.910 --> 00:38:22.920 align:start position:0%
in its five months of of six months that
 
00:38:25.069 --> 00:38:25.079 align:start position:0%
they put together eight meetings decided
 
00:38:27.290 --> 00:38:27.300 align:start position:0%
to go into further study was to identify
 
00:38:29.930 --> 00:38:29.940 align:start position:0%
try to identify the the actual impact to
 
00:38:32.450 --> 00:38:32.460 align:start position:0%
Wildlife populations
 
00:38:33.650 --> 00:38:33.660 align:start position:0%
um and I'm sorry I missed the second
 
00:38:43.550 --> 00:38:43.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:46.190 --> 00:38:46.200 align:start position:0%
cards whether it's online or in the
 
00:38:47.750 --> 00:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
stores in the larger quantities that we
 
00:38:48.829 --> 00:38:48.839 align:start position:0%
were hearing about in our previous
 
00:38:52.490 --> 00:38:52.500 align:start position:0%
hearing and I guess my concern is um I
 
00:38:54.170 --> 00:38:54.180 align:start position:0%
think we had conversation at that time
 
00:38:54.180 --> 00:38:55.609 align:start position:0%
think we had conversation at that time
about

00:38:55.609 --> 00:38:55.619 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:38:55.619 --> 00:38:56.870 align:start position:0%
about
um

00:38:56.870 --> 00:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:58.250 --> 00:38:58.260 align:start position:0%
they're being concerned about the
 
00:39:02.810 --> 00:39:02.820 align:start position:0%
ability to monitor that and so I I'm
 
00:39:04.910 --> 00:39:04.920 align:start position:0%
when you when you talked about buckets
 
00:39:07.190 --> 00:39:07.200 align:start position:0%
Madam chair I think of these things we
 
00:39:08.329 --> 00:39:08.339 align:start position:0%
do know that they're out there for
 
00:39:09.710 --> 00:39:09.720 align:start position:0%
purchase right now in those quantities
 
00:39:12.530 --> 00:39:12.540 align:start position:0%
so I'm curious about your thoughts about
 
00:39:14.569 --> 00:39:14.579 align:start position:0%
changes around that
 
00:39:18.130 --> 00:39:18.140 align:start position:0%
certainly if the second generation
 
00:39:20.210 --> 00:39:20.220 align:start position:0%
anticoagulant rodenticides are
 
00:39:21.829 --> 00:39:21.839 align:start position:0%
restricted use that takes it out of the
 
00:39:23.450 --> 00:39:23.460 align:start position:0%
hands of anyone that does not have a
 
00:39:25.550 --> 00:39:25.560 align:start position:0%
license and I think you will see
 
00:39:28.010 --> 00:39:28.020 align:start position:0%
an impact as far as availability to
 
00:39:29.630 --> 00:39:29.640 align:start position:0%
general consumers
 
00:39:31.910 --> 00:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
on the history of rodenticide regulation
 
00:39:35.569 --> 00:39:35.579 align:start position:0%
in right around 2011 EPA
 
00:39:37.970 --> 00:39:37.980 align:start position:0%
try to identify those products is only
 
00:39:41.150 --> 00:39:41.160 align:start position:0%
available to folks that are um that
 
00:39:42.530 --> 00:39:42.540 align:start position:0%
tried to get it out of the hand of the
 
00:39:44.450 --> 00:39:44.460 align:start position:0%
general consumers clearly that isn't
 
00:39:47.150 --> 00:39:47.160 align:start position:0%
working so someone could go to certain
 
00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:48.349 align:start position:0%
working so someone could go to certain
websites

00:39:48.349 --> 00:39:48.359 align:start position:0%
websites
 
00:39:50.450 --> 00:39:50.460 align:start position:0%
um even certain stores and and buy a
 
00:39:52.069 --> 00:39:52.079 align:start position:0%
five gallon container of some of these
 
00:39:54.950 --> 00:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
materials as far as how we watch that
 
00:39:56.870 --> 00:39:56.880 align:start position:0%
I'm on it to that it's really you know
 
00:39:58.550 --> 00:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
when you have a general use situation
 
00:39:59.690 --> 00:39:59.700 align:start position:0%
where someone could just go in a store
 
00:40:01.490 --> 00:40:01.500 align:start position:0%
and buy something or buy it online we
 
00:40:03.829 --> 00:40:03.839 align:start position:0%
can't really track that very well if
 
00:40:05.569 --> 00:40:05.579 align:start position:0%
it's restricted we can track it because
 
00:40:08.450 --> 00:40:08.460 align:start position:0%
that licensed individual has to report
 
00:40:10.910 --> 00:40:10.920 align:start position:0%
what they use in a given year how much
 
00:40:12.470 --> 00:40:12.480 align:start position:0%
where they used it what the target
 
00:40:14.450 --> 00:40:14.460 align:start position:0%
organism is so there's there's control
 
00:40:14.460 --> 00:40:17.750 align:start position:0%
organism is so there's there's control
there

00:40:17.750 --> 00:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:20.810 --> 00:40:20.820 align:start position:0%
um representative Murray I know that
 
00:40:24.050 --> 00:40:24.060 align:start position:0%
you know the other thing too is
 
00:40:28.430 --> 00:40:28.440 align:start position:0%
um as a consumer of a pesticide service
 
00:40:30.470 --> 00:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
I know that some of these pesticide
 
00:40:32.750 --> 00:40:32.760 align:start position:0%
service companies
 
00:40:36.230 --> 00:40:36.240 align:start position:0%
or animal rodent control companies I
 
00:40:38.870 --> 00:40:38.880 align:start position:0%
should say are stepping away from using
 
00:40:41.230 --> 00:40:41.240 align:start position:0%
some of these uh second generation
 
00:40:43.670 --> 00:40:43.680 align:start position:0%
rodenticides they I've received a letter
 
00:40:46.010 --> 00:40:46.020 align:start position:0%
from a company that I deal with saying
 
00:40:48.109 --> 00:40:48.119 align:start position:0%
that you know they've had enough of
 
00:40:48.119 --> 00:40:50.030 align:start position:0%
that you know they've had enough of
consumer

00:40:50.030 --> 00:40:50.040 align:start position:0%
consumer
 
00:40:52.790 --> 00:40:52.800 align:start position:0%
um feedback of people who don't want to
 
00:40:54.829 --> 00:40:54.839 align:start position:0%
use these kinds of substances on their
 
00:40:57.530 --> 00:40:57.540 align:start position:0%
properties that they are now stepping
 
00:40:59.630 --> 00:40:59.640 align:start position:0%
away from the use of these they still
 
00:41:01.730 --> 00:41:01.740 align:start position:0%
have them in their toolbox but they're
 
00:41:04.250 --> 00:41:04.260 align:start position:0%
stepping away from them and suggesting
 
00:41:08.210 --> 00:41:08.220 align:start position:0%
other means of rodent control so when I
 
00:41:11.089 --> 00:41:11.099 align:start position:0%
think that there's also at play here
 
00:41:13.310 --> 00:41:13.320 align:start position:0%
an element of
 
00:41:17.650 --> 00:41:17.660 align:start position:0%
the market correcting the use or overuse
 
00:41:20.510 --> 00:41:20.520 align:start position:0%
of some some of these substances and I
 
00:41:22.790 --> 00:41:22.800 align:start position:0%
think that we should also be cognizant
 
00:41:25.609 --> 00:41:25.619 align:start position:0%
of that kind of activity that's going on
 
00:41:28.190 --> 00:41:28.200 align:start position:0%
just so just so we know representative
 
00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:33.170 align:start position:0%
just so just so we know representative
Howard

00:41:33.170 --> 00:41:33.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:35.160 align:start position:0%
excuse me thank you madam chair
 
00:41:37.130 --> 00:41:37.140 align:start position:0%
um I have a couple points to make as far
 
00:41:40.370 --> 00:41:40.380 align:start position:0%
as anecdotal evidence goes um it might
 
00:41:42.109 --> 00:41:42.119 align:start position:0%
it will probably have to suffice because
 
00:41:44.810 --> 00:41:44.820 align:start position:0%
wild animals don't go to researchers to
 
00:41:47.030 --> 00:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
die they're not penned in they so the
 
00:41:48.950 --> 00:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
fact that they are are in the hands of
 
00:41:51.530 --> 00:41:51.540 align:start position:0%
researchers at all means that there is a
 
00:41:54.410 --> 00:41:54.420 align:start position:0%
significant or some impact and whether
 
00:41:56.810 --> 00:41:56.820 align:start position:0%
or not it endangers the species is
 
00:42:00.349 --> 00:42:00.359 align:start position:0%
that's that's too late right and I use
 
00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
00:42:04.670 --> 00:42:04.680 align:start position:0%
um paraquat as an example right now
 
00:42:06.890 --> 00:42:06.900 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with um the possibility
 
00:42:09.710 --> 00:42:09.720 align:start position:0%
that Parkinson's is caused by paraquat
 
00:42:11.630 --> 00:42:11.640 align:start position:0%
um and they're using it in the fields
 
00:42:13.910 --> 00:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
where you know
 
00:42:16.370 --> 00:42:16.380 align:start position:0%
um workers from you know Farm Workers
 
00:42:18.050 --> 00:42:18.060 align:start position:0%
are are being exposed to it now and
 
00:42:20.210 --> 00:42:20.220 align:start position:0%
there's lawsuits that are pursuing I
 
00:42:22.250 --> 00:42:22.260 align:start position:0%
just think that it's too late to wait
 
00:42:25.550 --> 00:42:25.560 align:start position:0%
until the impact is so great that that
 
00:42:27.589 --> 00:42:27.599 align:start position:0%
we're talking about you know like the
 
00:42:30.410 --> 00:42:30.420 align:start position:0%
you know the reduction or the or the um
 
00:42:35.030 --> 00:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:37.069 --> 00:42:37.079 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:42:37.079 --> 00:42:38.990 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
um

00:42:38.990 --> 00:42:39.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:41.329 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:42:41.329 --> 00:42:41.339 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:42:43.490 --> 00:42:43.500 align:start position:0%
a couple things
 
00:42:45.950 --> 00:42:45.960 align:start position:0%
um I was at a meeting not too long ago
 
00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
where they said that the Bobcat
 
00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:49.680 align:start position:0%
population was on the Rise
 
00:42:51.050 --> 00:42:51.060 align:start position:0%
um and that there was
 
00:42:52.370 --> 00:42:52.380 align:start position:0%
started they were starting to see a lot
 
00:42:55.310 --> 00:42:55.320 align:start position:0%
of roadkill and uh Bobcats
 
00:42:55.320 --> 00:42:56.750 align:start position:0%
of roadkill and uh Bobcats
so

00:42:56.750 --> 00:42:56.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:42:58.910 --> 00:42:58.920 align:start position:0%
um just wanted to put that out there the
 
00:43:02.150 --> 00:43:02.160 align:start position:0%
other thing is is the pesticide control
 
00:43:04.670 --> 00:43:04.680 align:start position:0%
board did exactly what we asked them to
 
00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:05.450 align:start position:0%
board did exactly what we asked them to
do

00:43:05.450 --> 00:43:05.460 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:43:07.790 --> 00:43:07.800 align:start position:0%
they went in they did the study they
 
00:43:09.950 --> 00:43:09.960 align:start position:0%
looked at it
 
00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
I do not think that it is this jobs this
 
00:43:16.670 --> 00:43:16.680 align:start position:0%
committee's job or the legislator's job
 
00:43:18.829 --> 00:43:18.839 align:start position:0%
to tell the pesticide control board
 
00:43:21.470 --> 00:43:21.480 align:start position:0%
which pesticides should be restricted
 
00:43:24.349 --> 00:43:24.359 align:start position:0%
use and which should not I believe it
 
00:43:28.790 --> 00:43:28.800 align:start position:0%
sets the slippery slope in the future
 
00:43:31.910 --> 00:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
I believe we rely on the experts
 
00:43:34.069 --> 00:43:34.079 align:start position:0%
and usually when we make a suggestion to
 
00:43:37.730 --> 00:43:37.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:41.390 --> 00:43:41.400 align:start position:0%
the other thing is is rodent
 
00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:42.710 align:start position:0%
the other thing is is rodent
problem

00:43:42.710 --> 00:43:42.720 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:43:47.089 --> 00:43:47.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:49.130 --> 00:43:49.140 align:start position:0%
I went to a greenhouse a couple years
 
00:43:52.190 --> 00:43:52.200 align:start position:0%
ago never saw a rat in my life in New
 
00:43:54.890 --> 00:43:54.900 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and they were running rampant
 
00:43:57.770 --> 00:43:57.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:00.470 --> 00:44:00.480 align:start position:0%
people need
 
00:44:05.089 --> 00:44:05.099 align:start position:0%
to be able to correct these problems and
 
00:44:07.190 --> 00:44:07.200 align:start position:0%
it's not through a pesticide service
 
00:44:09.050 --> 00:44:09.060 align:start position:0%
that's going to handle it
 
00:44:13.250 --> 00:44:13.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:16.370 --> 00:44:16.380 align:start position:0%
rodents carry disease
 
00:44:20.930 --> 00:44:20.940 align:start position:0%
and they affect agriculture in a bad way
 
00:44:24.770 --> 00:44:24.780 align:start position:0%
so we have to be mindful of that also
 
00:44:27.050 --> 00:44:27.060 align:start position:0%
and I do believe that the pesticide
 
00:44:28.790 --> 00:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
control board will listen to whatever
 
00:44:30.890 --> 00:44:30.900 align:start position:0%
we're saying here it will go back to
 
00:44:32.390 --> 00:44:32.400 align:start position:0%
them I'm
 
00:44:34.550 --> 00:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
going to make an assumption director
 
00:44:36.530 --> 00:44:36.540 align:start position:0%
Russo but I am sure that you will bring
 
00:44:38.690 --> 00:44:38.700 align:start position:0%
everything that we've talked to back to
 
00:44:41.450 --> 00:44:41.460 align:start position:0%
them in our concerns
 
00:44:45.470 --> 00:44:45.480 align:start position:0%
but I also think it's not our place
 
00:44:47.630 --> 00:44:47.640 align:start position:0%
represent Bixby
 
00:44:51.589 --> 00:44:51.599 align:start position:0%
uh the question for the director uh so
 
00:44:51.599 --> 00:44:52.849 align:start position:0%
uh the question for the director uh so
um

00:44:52.849 --> 00:44:52.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:55.849 --> 00:44:55.859 align:start position:0%
if this is a restricted dues a farmer
 
00:44:57.950 --> 00:44:57.960 align:start position:0%
who has a pesticide license would be
 
00:44:59.870 --> 00:44:59.880 align:start position:0%
able to use it correct that's correct
 
00:45:01.910 --> 00:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:45:04.870 --> 00:45:04.880 align:start position:0%
representative Creighton
 
00:45:07.490 --> 00:45:07.500 align:start position:0%
representative see I'm sorry I didn't
 
00:45:10.190 --> 00:45:10.200 align:start position:0%
see you over there that's okay thank you
 
00:45:12.589 --> 00:45:12.599 align:start position:0%
um I was surprised to learn on page nine
 
00:45:16.910 --> 00:45:16.920 align:start position:0%
the second paragraph uh when we heard
 
00:45:18.650 --> 00:45:18.660 align:start position:0%
this bill first I mean the the
 
00:45:20.930 --> 00:45:20.940 align:start position:0%
discussion was all about the increase in
 
00:45:23.809 --> 00:45:23.819 align:start position:0%
rats and how it was affecting the
 
00:45:25.730 --> 00:45:25.740 align:start position:0%
general population and I was really
 
00:45:28.190 --> 00:45:28.200 align:start position:0%
surprised it says the type of rodents
 
00:45:31.430 --> 00:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
noted included the house mouse and the
 
00:45:33.710 --> 00:45:33.720 align:start position:0%
house mouse was identified as the most
 
00:45:37.130 --> 00:45:37.140 align:start position:0%
common request for control followed by
 
00:45:39.069 --> 00:45:39.079 align:start position:0%
the Norway rat
 
00:45:42.710 --> 00:45:42.720 align:start position:0%
can you educate me I mean you know I I
 
00:45:44.870 --> 00:45:44.880 align:start position:0%
have cats and every once in a while I
 
00:45:47.089 --> 00:45:47.099 align:start position:0%
see a dead mouse
 
00:45:49.130 --> 00:45:49.140 align:start position:0%
um and you know
 
00:45:52.930 --> 00:45:52.940 align:start position:0%
I I just don't understand is are mice
 
00:45:57.970 --> 00:45:57.980 align:start position:0%
how devastating our mice to Children
 
00:46:00.849 --> 00:46:00.859 align:start position:0%
homeowners agriculture because I'm
 
00:46:05.150 --> 00:46:05.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:07.609 --> 00:46:07.619 align:start position:0%
if if it's okay I think it'd be best if
 
00:46:10.370 --> 00:46:10.380 align:start position:0%
this question was answered by Mr Karachi
 
00:46:12.770 --> 00:46:12.780 align:start position:0%
actually oversaw this study and if
 
00:46:13.849 --> 00:46:13.859 align:start position:0%
that's okay
 
00:46:15.890 --> 00:46:15.900 align:start position:0%
um I think Adam if you're all right with
 
00:46:22.130 --> 00:46:22.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:22.140 --> 00:46:23.329 align:start position:0%
 
thanks

00:46:23.329 --> 00:46:23.339 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
00:46:25.309 --> 00:46:25.319 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr Karachi and welcome good
 
00:46:27.530 --> 00:46:27.540 align:start position:0%
morning uh Madame Karachi I own pastend
 
00:46:30.470 --> 00:46:30.480 align:start position:0%
I was the uh structural pest control
 
00:46:32.809 --> 00:46:32.819 align:start position:0%
person on the board so to answer your
 
00:46:34.670 --> 00:46:34.680 align:start position:0%
question it really depends obviously you
 
00:46:36.650 --> 00:46:36.660 align:start position:0%
get the occasional mouse that you your
 
00:46:39.230 --> 00:46:39.240 align:start position:0%
cat catches not a big deal what we see a
 
00:46:41.089 --> 00:46:41.099 align:start position:0%
lot of especially in multi-family
 
00:46:44.510 --> 00:46:44.520 align:start position:0%
housing or low-income housing is the
 
00:46:46.670 --> 00:46:46.680 align:start position:0%
problem persists and then you get into
 
00:46:48.589 --> 00:46:48.599 align:start position:0%
attic spaces or you get into basements
 
00:46:51.530 --> 00:46:51.540 align:start position:0%
and the amount of rodent droppings and
 
00:46:54.829 --> 00:46:54.839 align:start position:0%
urine that is inside of the insulation
 
00:46:57.410 --> 00:46:57.420 align:start position:0%
or in those areas causes asthma health
 
00:46:59.750 --> 00:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
hazards other problems so it's not
 
00:47:02.089 --> 00:47:02.099 align:start position:0%
necessarily the occasional Mouse it's
 
00:47:04.069 --> 00:47:04.079 align:start position:0%
the situation where they they don't take
 
00:47:06.170 --> 00:47:06.180 align:start position:0%
care of the problem whether that's on
 
00:47:08.089 --> 00:47:08.099 align:start position:0%
their own or hiring someone they don't
 
00:47:09.530 --> 00:47:09.540 align:start position:0%
think it's a big deal and all of a
 
00:47:12.109 --> 00:47:12.119 align:start position:0%
sudden that one to two mice becomes 40
 
00:47:15.109 --> 00:47:15.119 align:start position:0%
50 100 mice and a pretty quick amount of
 
00:47:17.329 --> 00:47:17.339 align:start position:0%
time and then that can cause a lot of
 
00:47:19.250 --> 00:47:19.260 align:start position:0%
health hazards more so for children than
 
00:47:21.650 --> 00:47:21.660 align:start position:0%
anything else and then on top of that if
 
00:47:22.970 --> 00:47:22.980 align:start position:0%
they go to clean it up you can get
 
00:47:25.309 --> 00:47:25.319 align:start position:0%
antivirus you can get other respiratory
 
00:47:26.809 --> 00:47:26.819 align:start position:0%
issues that can come from from the
 
00:47:29.870 --> 00:47:29.880 align:start position:0%
droppings in urine as well
 
00:47:32.030 --> 00:47:32.040 align:start position:0%
represent Creighton
 
00:47:34.730 --> 00:47:34.740 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair uh Mr Russo
 
00:47:37.069 --> 00:47:37.079 align:start position:0%
just a question on the on the
 
00:47:40.730 --> 00:47:40.740 align:start position:0%
recommendations what What legislation
 
00:47:42.650 --> 00:47:42.660 align:start position:0%
would you need to enact these
 
00:47:42.660 --> 00:47:44.150 align:start position:0%
would you need to enact these
recommendations

00:47:44.150 --> 00:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
00:47:45.829 --> 00:47:45.839 align:start position:0%
is there anything that you would need
 
00:47:47.150 --> 00:47:47.160 align:start position:0%
from us
 
00:47:50.329 --> 00:47:50.339 align:start position:0%
to to move forward with with the
 
00:47:52.910 --> 00:47:52.920 align:start position:0%
recommendations from your study
 
00:47:54.890 --> 00:47:54.900 align:start position:0%
if EPA moves ahead with their
 
00:47:56.690 --> 00:47:56.700 align:start position:0%
preliminary decision which was to
 
00:47:57.890 --> 00:47:57.900 align:start position:0%
restrict the second generation
 
00:48:00.109 --> 00:48:00.119 align:start position:0%
anticoagulants there would be no need
 
00:48:02.809 --> 00:48:02.819 align:start position:0%
for for legislation at the state level
 
00:48:05.510 --> 00:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:48:08.390 --> 00:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
and Mr Russo um director Rousseau would
 
00:48:12.349 --> 00:48:12.359 align:start position:0%
you what's your sense of the time period
 
00:48:14.690 --> 00:48:14.700 align:start position:0%
where the EPA would do this
 
00:48:17.510 --> 00:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
when we ask we hear December of this
 
00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:18.309 align:start position:0%
when we ask we hear December of this
year

00:48:18.309 --> 00:48:18.319 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:48:20.870 --> 00:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
my experience is that sometimes it'll go
 
00:48:24.109 --> 00:48:24.119 align:start position:0%
a little few months over that but uh but
 
00:48:25.970 --> 00:48:25.980 align:start position:0%
that's what I've been told most likely
 
00:48:25.980 --> 00:48:27.710 align:start position:0%
that's what I've been told most likely
December

00:48:27.710 --> 00:48:27.720 align:start position:0%
December
 
00:48:32.030 --> 00:48:32.040 align:start position:0%
and as a follow-up what is your sense of
 
00:48:33.710 --> 00:48:33.720 align:start position:0%
um do you believe that they would move
 
00:48:36.530 --> 00:48:36.540 align:start position:0%
for restricting this yes substances I I
 
00:48:39.170 --> 00:48:39.180 align:start position:0%
firmly believe that yeah
 
00:48:41.870 --> 00:48:41.880 align:start position:0%
representative Murray
 
00:48:43.730 --> 00:48:43.740 align:start position:0%
um thank you madam chair I get I guess
 
00:48:45.829 --> 00:48:45.839 align:start position:0%
to that end if if we're concerned about
 
00:48:47.870 --> 00:48:47.880 align:start position:0%
a timeline where there would be a period
 
00:48:50.390 --> 00:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
of time where Second Use has not been
 
00:48:52.609 --> 00:48:52.619 align:start position:0%
enacted by the EPA
 
00:48:54.230 --> 00:48:54.240 align:start position:0%
um would it not make sense to put
 
00:48:56.510 --> 00:48:56.520 align:start position:0%
something temporary in place that could
 
00:48:59.270 --> 00:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
give us six months to a year
 
00:49:01.790 --> 00:49:01.800 align:start position:0%
um where that could then be sunsetted
 
00:49:04.790 --> 00:49:04.800 align:start position:0%
and it we could reevaluate where we're
 
00:49:07.370 --> 00:49:07.380 align:start position:0%
at if that's the based on the study
 
00:49:10.190 --> 00:49:10.200 align:start position:0%
results the information I'm a little bit
 
00:49:12.050 --> 00:49:12.060 align:start position:0%
concerned that we don't have if there's
 
00:49:13.730 --> 00:49:13.740 align:start position:0%
no data there's no problem and if we
 
00:49:13.740 --> 00:49:16.069 align:start position:0%
no data there's no problem and if we
can't

00:49:16.069 --> 00:49:16.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:18.050 --> 00:49:18.060 align:start position:0%
collect the data because second
 
00:49:21.710 --> 00:49:21.720 align:start position:0%
generation General use is not tracked
 
00:49:23.150 --> 00:49:23.160 align:start position:0%
um and we
 
00:49:25.670 --> 00:49:25.680 align:start position:0%
had testimony as to the effects of of
 
00:49:28.010 --> 00:49:28.020 align:start position:0%
these things and sort of we are seeing
 
00:49:29.150 --> 00:49:29.160 align:start position:0%
the writing on the wall and where the
 
00:49:31.010 --> 00:49:31.020 align:start position:0%
direction is going
 
00:49:33.050 --> 00:49:33.060 align:start position:0%
um it it would be my preference to see
 
00:49:34.790 --> 00:49:34.800 align:start position:0%
something at least temporary put in
 
00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:36.710 align:start position:0%
something at least temporary put in
place

00:49:36.710 --> 00:49:36.720 align:start position:0%
place
 
00:49:38.630 --> 00:49:38.640 align:start position:0%
representative Howard
 
00:49:41.150 --> 00:49:41.160 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I also wonder what
 
00:49:43.849 --> 00:49:43.859 align:start position:0%
the restrictions include and if we don't
 
00:49:45.950 --> 00:49:45.960 align:start position:0%
need to use the EPA restrictions as a
 
00:49:48.170 --> 00:49:48.180 align:start position:0%
Baseline and see if it includes things
 
00:49:49.670 --> 00:49:49.680 align:start position:0%
like that they're mentioned in the
 
00:49:51.710 --> 00:49:51.720 align:start position:0%
report like protective clothing and that
 
00:49:53.450 --> 00:49:53.460 align:start position:0%
kind of stuff
 
00:49:55.609 --> 00:49:55.619 align:start position:0%
representative Contour
 
00:49:58.270 --> 00:49:58.280 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:50:01.730 --> 00:50:01.740 align:start position:0%
if this product can be sold online in
 
00:50:04.490 --> 00:50:04.500 align:start position:0%
other states that are local to us that
 
00:50:06.290 --> 00:50:06.300 align:start position:0%
do not have restricted use
 
00:50:09.650 --> 00:50:09.660 align:start position:0%
you're going to make criminals out of
 
00:50:11.630 --> 00:50:11.640 align:start position:0%
law-abiding citizens because they will
 
00:50:14.809 --> 00:50:14.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:17.870 --> 00:50:17.880 align:start position:0%
president germana
 
00:50:20.930 --> 00:50:20.940 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I just uh wanted
 
00:50:22.730 --> 00:50:22.740 align:start position:0%
to say that I agree with the point that
 
00:50:24.829 --> 00:50:24.839 align:start position:0%
the chair made earlier very much so
 
00:50:27.349 --> 00:50:27.359 align:start position:0%
about concern about you know the cost
 
00:50:29.510 --> 00:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
burden right in terms of of kind of the
 
00:50:31.910 --> 00:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
average you know Granite stator in terms
 
00:50:34.250 --> 00:50:34.260 align:start position:0%
of dealing with these issues and the
 
00:50:36.650 --> 00:50:36.660 align:start position:0%
expense of bringing in a pest control
 
00:50:38.510 --> 00:50:38.520 align:start position:0%
person as opposed to being able to deal
 
00:50:42.109 --> 00:50:42.119 align:start position:0%
with with some issues on their own
 
00:50:44.089 --> 00:50:44.099 align:start position:0%
I would also say I was really impressed
 
00:50:46.910 --> 00:50:46.920 align:start position:0%
when we heard testimony previously from
 
00:50:49.309 --> 00:50:49.319 align:start position:0%
our Pest Control specialists in terms of
 
00:50:51.890 --> 00:50:51.900 align:start position:0%
them describing you know the the kind of
 
00:50:56.809 --> 00:50:56.819 align:start position:0%
hierarchy or right the the level of of
 
00:50:56.819 --> 00:50:57.650 align:start position:0%
hierarchy or right the the level of of
um

00:50:57.650 --> 00:50:57.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:59.630 --> 00:50:59.640 align:start position:0%
techniques that they use right and this
 
00:51:01.490 --> 00:51:01.500 align:start position:0%
is kind of on the nuclear option end of
 
00:51:02.930 --> 00:51:02.940 align:start position:0%
things and there are other things that
 
00:51:05.329 --> 00:51:05.339 align:start position:0%
you would you would try first and I
 
00:51:07.549 --> 00:51:07.559 align:start position:0%
think we all accept when it comes to the
 
00:51:09.049 --> 00:51:09.059 align:start position:0%
application of these kinds of chemicals
 
00:51:10.609 --> 00:51:10.619 align:start position:0%
that there's a line that has to be drawn
 
00:51:12.230 --> 00:51:12.240 align:start position:0%
somewhere right so that we say that
 
00:51:14.390 --> 00:51:14.400 align:start position:0%
there is a point where uh it should be
 
00:51:16.730 --> 00:51:16.740 align:start position:0%
professionals who are doing this work as
 
00:51:18.589 --> 00:51:18.599 align:start position:0%
opposed to an individual in their own
 
00:51:21.589 --> 00:51:21.599 align:start position:0%
home and in their own community and it
 
00:51:24.290 --> 00:51:24.300 align:start position:0%
seems to me that the uh the question
 
00:51:27.890 --> 00:51:27.900 align:start position:0%
about making it restricted uh the second
 
00:51:29.870 --> 00:51:29.880 align:start position:0%
recommendation I also agree with with
 
00:51:32.450 --> 00:51:32.460 align:start position:0%
representative comptwa about the The
 
00:51:34.370 --> 00:51:34.380 align:start position:0%
Pest Control Board here did exactly what
 
00:51:35.930 --> 00:51:35.940 align:start position:0%
we asked them to do delivered a report
 
00:51:38.349 --> 00:51:38.359 align:start position:0%
they gave us really valuable information
 
00:51:41.510 --> 00:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
the second recommendation is that we
 
00:51:42.770 --> 00:51:42.780 align:start position:0%
could do something right which is
 
00:51:46.010 --> 00:51:46.020 align:start position:0%
contingent upon the outcome of the EPA
 
00:51:48.109 --> 00:51:48.119 align:start position:0%
review right which means either if that
 
00:51:50.450 --> 00:51:50.460 align:start position:0%
review takes longer than it should then
 
00:51:52.010 --> 00:51:52.020 align:start position:0%
there is something in place or if there
 
00:51:53.450 --> 00:51:53.460 align:start position:0%
are elements of that review that we're
 
00:51:55.549 --> 00:51:55.559 align:start position:0%
just not satisfied with we could take a
 
00:51:56.510 --> 00:51:56.520 align:start position:0%
different route
 
00:51:59.210 --> 00:51:59.220 align:start position:0%
I would also if I may just quickly point
 
00:52:01.730 --> 00:52:01.740 align:start position:0%
out I hope we don't ignore the first and
 
00:52:03.349 --> 00:52:03.359 align:start position:0%
third recommendations we've been talking
 
00:52:04.849 --> 00:52:04.859 align:start position:0%
a lot about the second recommendation
 
00:52:08.510 --> 00:52:08.520 align:start position:0%
but this question about uh what kind of
 
00:52:10.250 --> 00:52:10.260 align:start position:0%
evidence we have about the scope of this
 
00:52:10.260 --> 00:52:11.630 align:start position:0%
evidence we have about the scope of this
problem

00:52:11.630 --> 00:52:11.640 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:52:15.650 --> 00:52:15.660 align:start position:0%
um uh is a difficulty in terms of how
 
00:52:17.510 --> 00:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
we're able to gather the data as as
 
00:52:19.370 --> 00:52:19.380 align:start position:0%
representative Howard pointed out and I
 
00:52:20.630 --> 00:52:20.640 align:start position:0%
tend to believe in a case like this
 
00:52:22.130 --> 00:52:22.140 align:start position:0%
where there's smoke there's fire if
 
00:52:23.690 --> 00:52:23.700 align:start position:0%
there's enough anecdotal evidence it
 
00:52:25.010 --> 00:52:25.020 align:start position:0%
points to something bigger than what's
 
00:52:27.950 --> 00:52:27.960 align:start position:0%
here and I would really uh like to to to
 
00:52:31.069 --> 00:52:31.079 align:start position:0%
see the development of what I see in the
 
00:52:32.510 --> 00:52:32.520 align:start position:0%
first and third points because I think
 
00:52:35.210 --> 00:52:35.220 align:start position:0%
that's our best chance of getting better
 
00:52:36.890 --> 00:52:36.900 align:start position:0%
data so that we do have a better sense
 
00:52:38.450 --> 00:52:38.460 align:start position:0%
of the scope of the problem
 
00:52:40.910 --> 00:52:40.920 align:start position:0%
thank you sorry for the long-winded
 
00:52:43.370 --> 00:52:43.380 align:start position:0%
and I I have a question for the director
 
00:52:44.870 --> 00:52:44.880 align:start position:0%
is um
 
00:52:47.329 --> 00:52:47.339 align:start position:0%
with regard to the recommendations that
 
00:52:49.370 --> 00:52:49.380 align:start position:0%
are in this report are these
 
00:52:49.380 --> 00:52:51.530 align:start position:0%
are in this report are these
recommendations

00:52:51.530 --> 00:52:51.540 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
00:52:54.290 --> 00:52:54.300 align:start position:0%
that which you would have the pesticide
 
00:52:58.309 --> 00:52:58.319 align:start position:0%
control board do in other words you
 
00:53:01.309 --> 00:53:01.319 align:start position:0%
recommend the recommendation is for
 
00:53:04.069 --> 00:53:04.079 align:start position:0%
the pesticide control board to explore
 
00:53:06.290 --> 00:53:06.300 align:start position:0%
potential for further research
 
00:53:06.300 --> 00:53:08.390 align:start position:0%
potential for further research
Etc

00:53:08.390 --> 00:53:08.400 align:start position:0%
Etc
 
00:53:08.400 --> 00:53:09.349 align:start position:0%
Etc
um

00:53:09.349 --> 00:53:09.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:11.930 --> 00:53:11.940 align:start position:0%
so the these um recommendations are
 
00:53:13.549 --> 00:53:13.559 align:start position:0%
based on the 10 individuals that
 
00:53:16.250 --> 00:53:16.260 align:start position:0%
represent um and that the list of folks
 
00:53:19.069 --> 00:53:19.079 align:start position:0%
in their their uh yes affiliations are
 
00:53:21.230 --> 00:53:21.240 align:start position:0%
are listed on the on page two so that
 
00:53:22.730 --> 00:53:22.740 align:start position:0%
yes so these are recommendations that
 
00:53:25.490 --> 00:53:25.500 align:start position:0%
were put forth by the task force
 
00:53:28.910 --> 00:53:28.920 align:start position:0%
um certainly the board you know in the
 
00:53:30.710 --> 00:53:30.720 align:start position:0%
board meets next Tuesday and we'll
 
00:53:33.530 --> 00:53:33.540 align:start position:0%
review this by the way but um
 
00:53:33.540 --> 00:53:34.630 align:start position:0%
review this by the way but um
and

00:53:34.630 --> 00:53:34.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:53:36.829 --> 00:53:36.839 align:start position:0%
determine you know what what piece is
 
00:53:38.630 --> 00:53:38.640 align:start position:0%
the board could actually adopt as
 
00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:40.670 align:start position:0%
the board could actually adopt as
recommendations

00:53:40.670 --> 00:53:40.680 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
00:53:40.680 --> 00:53:41.390 align:start position:0%
recommendations
um

00:53:41.390 --> 00:53:41.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:43.609 --> 00:53:43.619 align:start position:0%
clearly it's identified as a concern the
 
00:53:45.650 --> 00:53:45.660 align:start position:0%
second generation residue and Wildlife
 
00:53:47.630 --> 00:53:47.640 align:start position:0%
so the board will probably
 
00:53:49.309 --> 00:53:49.319 align:start position:0%
um and I can't speak fully on the board
 
00:53:50.690 --> 00:53:50.700 align:start position:0%
I don't work for the I work for the
 
00:53:53.329 --> 00:53:53.339 align:start position:0%
board I'm not on the board but um
 
00:53:56.049 --> 00:53:56.059 align:start position:0%
the board could move to to sort of
 
00:53:58.130 --> 00:53:58.140 align:start position:0%
identify that these three items be
 
00:53:58.140 --> 00:54:01.010 align:start position:0%
identify that these three items be
addressed

00:54:01.010 --> 00:54:01.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:01.020 --> 00:54:03.230 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:54:03.230 --> 00:54:03.240 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:54:08.569 --> 00:54:08.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:08.579 --> 00:54:10.450 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:54:10.450 --> 00:54:10.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:13.329 --> 00:54:13.339 align:start position:0%
directive thank you
 
00:54:18.829 --> 00:54:18.839 align:start position:0%
to to put a restriction on any of
 
00:54:20.750 --> 00:54:20.760 align:start position:0%
you know any of these substances you
 
00:54:22.549 --> 00:54:22.559 align:start position:0%
know you could do that on your own
 
00:54:24.170 --> 00:54:24.180 align:start position:0%
correct I'm sorry I interrupted yeah
 
00:54:26.870 --> 00:54:26.880 align:start position:0%
that's true okay
 
00:54:26.880 --> 00:54:27.710 align:start position:0%
that's true okay
um

00:54:27.710 --> 00:54:27.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:29.870 --> 00:54:29.880 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:54:32.569 --> 00:54:32.579 align:start position:0%
any other representative Dotsy
 
00:54:36.170 --> 00:54:36.180 align:start position:0%
uh yeah so just for clarification if we
 
00:54:39.470 --> 00:54:39.480 align:start position:0%
wanted to move forward with this bill as
 
00:54:42.230 --> 00:54:42.240 align:start position:0%
uh representative Bixby said and and
 
00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:43.370 align:start position:0%
uh representative Bixby said and and
restricted

00:54:43.370 --> 00:54:43.380 align:start position:0%
restricted
 
00:54:45.170 --> 00:54:45.180 align:start position:0%
when we're looking at the time frame I
 
00:54:48.470 --> 00:54:48.480 align:start position:0%
mean we could move this through and in
 
00:54:51.950 --> 00:54:51.960 align:start position:0%
December if the EPA does
 
00:54:51.960 --> 00:54:52.549 align:start position:0%
December if the EPA does
um

00:54:52.549 --> 00:54:52.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:57.349 --> 00:54:57.359 align:start position:0%
uh uh you know rule on this then the
 
00:54:59.569 --> 00:54:59.579 align:start position:0%
bill doesn't have we can withdraw it it
 
00:55:01.910 --> 00:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to go forward correct I
 
00:55:03.829 --> 00:55:03.839 align:start position:0%
mean because it wouldn't go to committee
 
00:55:07.849 --> 00:55:07.859 align:start position:0%
until sometime in January anyway correct
 
00:55:10.549 --> 00:55:10.559 align:start position:0%
yeah right right oh okay so I mean we
 
00:55:12.650 --> 00:55:12.660 align:start position:0%
could decide to move forward on it but
 
00:55:15.829 --> 00:55:15.839 align:start position:0%
recognizing that if the timing coincides
 
00:55:18.710 --> 00:55:18.720 align:start position:0%
it the bill could be withdrawn okay
 
00:55:21.349 --> 00:55:21.359 align:start position:0%
and as I'm understanding the pesticide
 
00:55:23.569 --> 00:55:23.579 align:start position:0%
control board can also say we're going
 
00:55:25.910 --> 00:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
to restrict usage of this product
 
00:55:28.130 --> 00:55:28.140 align:start position:0%
with this substance and we wouldn't have
 
00:55:29.630 --> 00:55:29.640 align:start position:0%
to do anything
 
00:55:31.430 --> 00:55:31.440 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:55:33.230 --> 00:55:33.240 align:start position:0%
represent Bixby
 
00:55:37.250 --> 00:55:37.260 align:start position:0%
so another possibility is that we could
 
00:55:41.750 --> 00:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
write the bill with uh an effective date
 
00:55:43.970 --> 00:55:43.980 align:start position:0%
essentially essentially saying that if
 
00:55:46.910 --> 00:55:46.920 align:start position:0%
the EPA has not acted by such and such a
 
00:55:49.130 --> 00:55:49.140 align:start position:0%
date then
 
00:55:52.670 --> 00:55:52.680 align:start position:0%
um then we direct the uh pesticide
 
00:55:55.670 --> 00:55:55.680 align:start position:0%
control board to to make the
 
00:55:55.680 --> 00:55:56.329 align:start position:0%
control board to to make the
um

00:55:56.329 --> 00:55:56.339 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:59.569 --> 00:55:59.579 align:start position:0%
to make it restricted use so that uh and
 
00:56:00.950 --> 00:56:00.960 align:start position:0%
then uh
 
00:56:03.170 --> 00:56:03.180 align:start position:0%
that would also uh
 
00:56:06.650 --> 00:56:06.660 align:start position:0%
sort of create and give give a little
 
00:56:07.849 --> 00:56:07.859 align:start position:0%
bit more leeway and put a little bit
 
00:56:10.329 --> 00:56:10.339 align:start position:0%
more power still in the hands of the
 
00:56:13.549 --> 00:56:13.559 align:start position:0%
pesticide control board
 
00:56:17.089 --> 00:56:17.099 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby I think that I I
 
00:56:19.430 --> 00:56:19.440 align:start position:0%
I'm not um
 
00:56:22.250 --> 00:56:22.260 align:start position:0%
I don't know that I would want to direct
 
00:56:25.490 --> 00:56:25.500 align:start position:0%
the pesticide control board to restrict
 
00:56:27.890 --> 00:56:27.900 align:start position:0%
something I think that's something that
 
00:56:30.710 --> 00:56:30.720 align:start position:0%
we must leave up to them based on their
 
00:56:35.390 --> 00:56:35.400 align:start position:0%
study and how you know what their review
 
00:56:39.829 --> 00:56:39.839 align:start position:0%
board the pesticide review board decides
 
00:56:44.150 --> 00:56:44.160 align:start position:0%
represent Bixby yeah so I proposed that
 
00:56:46.870 --> 00:56:46.880 align:start position:0%
um that uh
 
00:56:50.329 --> 00:56:50.339 align:start position:0%
uh I or someone else uh work on an
 
00:56:52.730 --> 00:56:52.740 align:start position:0%
amendment and then when we come to exec
 
00:56:54.950 --> 00:56:54.960 align:start position:0%
this at the end of October we can make a
 
00:56:56.390 --> 00:56:56.400 align:start position:0%
decision at that point as a committee
 
00:56:58.670 --> 00:56:58.680 align:start position:0%
because I think I think we're there are
 
00:57:00.829 --> 00:57:00.839 align:start position:0%
clearly a couple of trains of thought
 
00:57:02.930 --> 00:57:02.940 align:start position:0%
here uh and we're not going to get it
 
00:57:05.690 --> 00:57:05.700 align:start position:0%
resolved today so uh we should
 
00:57:08.569 --> 00:57:08.579 align:start position:0%
um so but it seems to me that we and I
 
00:57:10.069 --> 00:57:10.079 align:start position:0%
didn't mean to interrupt you but it it
 
00:57:13.010 --> 00:57:13.020 align:start position:0%
seems to me that we have two things we
 
00:57:15.290 --> 00:57:15.300 align:start position:0%
were waiting for we're either waiting
 
00:57:17.150 --> 00:57:17.160 align:start position:0%
for the EPA to come out with a decision
 
00:57:19.790 --> 00:57:19.800 align:start position:0%
or the pesticide review board to come
 
00:57:22.430 --> 00:57:22.440 align:start position:0%
out with a decision and I don't know
 
00:57:22.440 --> 00:57:23.809 align:start position:0%
out with a decision and I don't know
that

00:57:23.809 --> 00:57:23.819 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:57:26.930 --> 00:57:26.940 align:start position:0%
you need any legislative activity
 
00:57:29.030 --> 00:57:29.040 align:start position:0%
to go along with any of those two
 
00:57:29.040 --> 00:57:31.549 align:start position:0%
to go along with any of those two
outcomes

00:57:31.549 --> 00:57:31.559 align:start position:0%
outcomes
 
00:57:35.809 --> 00:57:35.819 align:start position:0%
well um and well I I propose that
 
00:57:38.329 --> 00:57:38.339 align:start position:0%
um that I or someone else who is
 
00:57:39.950 --> 00:57:39.960 align:start position:0%
interested in doing so make an amendment
 
00:57:43.250 --> 00:57:43.260 align:start position:0%
and then we resolve it in uh when we
 
00:57:44.930 --> 00:57:44.940 align:start position:0%
have time to exact because I don't think
 
00:57:46.130 --> 00:57:46.140 align:start position:0%
we're going to get any further today
 
00:57:48.950 --> 00:57:48.960 align:start position:0%
representative you have comment yes I
 
00:57:51.829 --> 00:57:51.839 align:start position:0%
did thank you madam chair
 
00:57:53.510 --> 00:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
although I understand Representatives
 
00:57:55.549 --> 00:57:55.559 align:start position:0%
bixby's concerns and other members of
 
00:57:57.530 --> 00:57:57.540 align:start position:0%
this delegation's concern this
 
00:58:00.049 --> 00:58:00.059 align:start position:0%
committee's concern
 
00:58:02.390 --> 00:58:02.400 align:start position:0%
we have a pesticide control board for a
 
00:58:05.210 --> 00:58:05.220 align:start position:0%
reason we rely on their expertise
 
00:58:07.849 --> 00:58:07.859 align:start position:0%
and again they have done everything that
 
00:58:09.530 --> 00:58:09.540 align:start position:0%
we have asked
 
00:58:12.890 --> 00:58:12.900 align:start position:0%
I think that delegate legislating what
 
00:58:15.650 --> 00:58:15.660 align:start position:0%
they can and cannot restrict
 
00:58:18.950 --> 00:58:18.960 align:start position:0%
sent is a slippery slope because what's
 
00:58:21.710 --> 00:58:21.720 align:start position:0%
to stop in the future legislation from
 
00:58:23.569 --> 00:58:23.579 align:start position:0%
bypassing the pestico control board
 
00:58:23.579 --> 00:58:24.710 align:start position:0%
bypassing the pestico control board
altogether

00:58:24.710 --> 00:58:24.720 align:start position:0%
altogether
 
00:58:27.589 --> 00:58:27.599 align:start position:0%
and and making further legislation on
 
00:58:29.809 --> 00:58:29.819 align:start position:0%
what can be used in agriculture or in
 
00:58:35.270 --> 00:58:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:35.280 --> 00:58:36.829 align:start position:0%
 
question

00:58:36.829 --> 00:58:36.839 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:58:39.470 --> 00:58:39.480 align:start position:0%
do you have any other comments
 
00:58:41.270 --> 00:58:41.280 align:start position:0%
no but thank you very much for your time
 
00:58:42.890 --> 00:58:42.900 align:start position:0%
on this subject it's greatly appreciated
 
00:58:44.809 --> 00:58:44.819 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:58:48.109 --> 00:58:48.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:51.289 --> 00:58:51.299 align:start position:0%
we will move on to our next
 
00:58:53.930 --> 00:58:53.940 align:start position:0%
the next bill that and and thank you
 
00:58:56.930 --> 00:58:56.940 align:start position:0%
very much uh I want to extend this
 
00:58:59.150 --> 00:58:59.160 align:start position:0%
committee's thanks to the pesticide
 
00:59:01.609 --> 00:59:01.619 align:start position:0%
review board for this very well written
 
00:59:04.250 --> 00:59:04.260 align:start position:0%
preliminary report we look forward to
 
00:59:05.990 --> 00:59:06.000 align:start position:0%
the final report
 
00:59:08.569 --> 00:59:08.579 align:start position:0%
and we look forward to further
 
00:59:10.309 --> 00:59:10.319 align:start position:0%
conversation with you regarding this
 
00:59:10.319 --> 00:59:11.450 align:start position:0%
conversation with you regarding this
topic

00:59:11.450 --> 00:59:11.460 align:start position:0%
topic
 
00:59:17.089 --> 00:59:17.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:17.099 --> 00:59:19.250 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:59:19.250 --> 00:59:19.260 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:59:20.510 --> 00:59:20.520 align:start position:0%
um the next bill that we're going to
 
00:59:23.690 --> 00:59:23.700 align:start position:0%
discuss is HB 369
 
00:59:26.030 --> 00:59:26.040 align:start position:0%
establishing a task force to provide
 
00:59:29.030 --> 00:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
energy relief on farms representative
 
00:59:29.040 --> 00:59:30.109 align:start position:0%
energy relief on farms representative
Bixby

00:59:30.109 --> 00:59:30.119 align:start position:0%
Bixby
 
00:59:35.270 --> 00:59:35.280 align:start position:0%
so last last spring I spoke with uh the
 
00:59:37.190 --> 00:59:37.200 align:start position:0%
Camel Valley who's the director of
 
00:59:41.030 --> 00:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
Cooperative Extension to see if uh they
 
00:59:45.650 --> 00:59:45.660 align:start position:0%
would be interested in uh in
 
00:59:45.660 --> 00:59:46.309 align:start position:0%
would be interested in uh in
um

00:59:46.309 --> 00:59:46.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:49.250 --> 00:59:49.260 align:start position:0%
and having a field specialist who would
 
00:59:49.260 --> 00:59:51.069 align:start position:0%
and having a field specialist who would
help

00:59:51.069 --> 00:59:51.079 align:start position:0%
help
 
00:59:53.589 --> 00:59:53.599 align:start position:0%
farms uh
 
00:59:56.930 --> 00:59:56.940 align:start position:0%
assess assess and and work out their
 
01:00:01.190 --> 01:00:01.200 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency and uh generation
 
01:00:04.730 --> 01:00:04.740 align:start position:0%
strategies uh in order to help Farms
 
01:00:07.670 --> 01:00:07.680 align:start position:0%
negotiate the basically the paperwork
 
01:00:11.390 --> 01:00:11.400 align:start position:0%
morass that this can turn into and
 
01:00:11.400 --> 01:00:12.230 align:start position:0%
morass that this can turn into and
um

01:00:12.230 --> 01:00:12.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:14.270 --> 01:00:14.280 align:start position:0%
and he said that he would be interested
 
01:00:17.990 --> 01:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
in uh having uh a position like that in
 
01:00:20.569 --> 01:00:20.579 align:start position:0%
uh Cooperative Extension uh Cooperative
 
01:00:24.170 --> 01:00:24.180 align:start position:0%
Extension has uh very good relationships
 
01:00:26.870 --> 01:00:26.880 align:start position:0%
across the agricultural community in the
 
01:00:30.530 --> 01:00:30.540 align:start position:0%
State uh so this would be a good uh way
 
01:00:34.010 --> 01:00:34.020 align:start position:0%
to provide support a lot of farms could
 
01:00:38.150 --> 01:00:38.160 align:start position:0%
really use uh to have uh better Energy
 
01:00:42.609 --> 01:00:42.619 align:start position:0%
Efficiency and energy production
 
01:00:45.470 --> 01:00:45.480 align:start position:0%
and I I don't think I need to go into
 
01:00:47.690 --> 01:00:47.700 align:start position:0%
the details of you know how you know the
 
01:00:50.510 --> 01:00:50.520 align:start position:0%
various ways that would be useful and
 
01:00:53.089 --> 01:00:53.099 align:start position:0%
the capacities of farms to you know they
 
01:00:56.450 --> 01:00:56.460 align:start position:0%
have the land they have the onto
 
01:00:56.460 --> 01:00:57.109 align:start position:0%
have the land they have the onto
um

01:00:57.109 --> 01:00:57.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:03.289 --> 01:01:03.299 align:start position:0%
and to use uh solar to uh uh for Maple
 
01:01:05.569 --> 01:01:05.579 align:start position:0%
Farmers upgrading to
 
01:01:08.809 --> 01:01:08.819 align:start position:0%
um to using more reverse osmosis that
 
01:01:11.750 --> 01:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
sort of thing this is this is something
 
01:01:13.970 --> 01:01:13.980 align:start position:0%
that Cooperative Extension could advise
 
01:01:16.010 --> 01:01:16.020 align:start position:0%
on and
 
01:01:20.170 --> 01:01:20.180 align:start position:0%
um I am happy to work on work with uh
 
01:01:23.930 --> 01:01:23.940 align:start position:0%
Kendall Valley and uh and the department
 
01:01:27.230 --> 01:01:27.240 align:start position:0%
to come up with an amendment to this
 
01:01:29.630 --> 01:01:29.640 align:start position:0%
that changes it from a task force which
 
01:01:30.950 --> 01:01:30.960 align:start position:0%
would just be a bunch of people talking
 
01:01:33.710 --> 01:01:33.720 align:start position:0%
in you know talking in a room and not
 
01:01:36.170 --> 01:01:36.180 align:start position:0%
getting much done to a field specialist
 
01:01:38.750 --> 01:01:38.760 align:start position:0%
who would actually be able to
 
01:01:42.650 --> 01:01:42.660 align:start position:0%
um help uh help move forward on energy
 
01:01:45.730 --> 01:01:45.740 align:start position:0%
which is a an important
 
01:01:48.349 --> 01:01:48.359 align:start position:0%
aspect of being able to run a farm
 
01:01:48.359 --> 01:01:49.730 align:start position:0%
aspect of being able to run a farm
effectively

01:01:49.730 --> 01:01:49.740 align:start position:0%
effectively
 
01:01:52.190 --> 01:01:52.200 align:start position:0%
so um any
 
01:01:54.890 --> 01:01:54.900 align:start position:0%
thoughts about that my I just also
 
01:01:56.750 --> 01:01:56.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to interject that
 
01:01:59.690 --> 01:01:59.700 align:start position:0%
um we I did send out an email late last
 
01:02:02.510 --> 01:02:02.520 align:start position:0%
night for an email that I received from
 
01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:03.589 align:start position:0%
night for an email that I received from
uh

01:02:03.589 --> 01:02:03.599 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:02:06.349 --> 01:02:06.359 align:start position:0%
Griffin robers he's the state energy
 
01:02:10.490 --> 01:02:10.500 align:start position:0%
program manager who made it made us
 
01:02:12.549 --> 01:02:12.559 align:start position:0%
aware of the
 
01:02:16.010 --> 01:02:16.020 align:start position:0%
USDA Federal funding programs rural
 
01:02:18.670 --> 01:02:18.680 align:start position:0%
energy for America program reap
 
01:02:22.190 --> 01:02:22.200 align:start position:0%
apparently that information is available
 
01:02:25.370 --> 01:02:25.380 align:start position:0%
to small businesses and agricultural
 
01:02:28.010 --> 01:02:28.020 align:start position:0%
producers for Energy Efficiency and
 
01:02:31.549 --> 01:02:31.559 align:start position:0%
renewable energy projects so I'm
 
01:02:33.170 --> 01:02:33.180 align:start position:0%
wondering if
 
01:02:36.309 --> 01:02:36.319 align:start position:0%
there would be some overlap between what
 
01:02:39.589 --> 01:02:39.599 align:start position:0%
our New Hampshire Department of energy
 
01:02:43.490 --> 01:02:43.500 align:start position:0%
is already doing versus what UNH May
 
01:02:47.030 --> 01:02:47.040 align:start position:0%
provide represent Bixby yeah so um I
 
01:02:49.490 --> 01:02:49.500 align:start position:0%
actually spoke with so the reap program
 
01:02:52.849 --> 01:02:52.859 align:start position:0%
is run through the USDA office in
 
01:02:54.530 --> 01:02:54.540 align:start position:0%
Burlington which covers both New
 
01:02:59.569 --> 01:02:59.579 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and uh and uh Vermont and uh
 
01:03:01.549 --> 01:03:01.559 align:start position:0%
one and I spoke to people who have gone
 
01:03:04.490 --> 01:03:04.500 align:start position:0%
through the that process and the reap
 
01:03:08.450 --> 01:03:08.460 align:start position:0%
paperwork is uh it's real it's fairly
 
01:03:11.630 --> 01:03:11.640 align:start position:0%
challenging and um so I got I got
 
01:03:13.849 --> 01:03:13.859 align:start position:0%
information I got a list of from Tara
 
01:03:13.859 --> 01:03:14.990 align:start position:0%
information I got a list of from Tara
sad

01:03:14.990 --> 01:03:15.000 align:start position:0%
sad
 
01:03:17.930 --> 01:03:17.940 align:start position:0%
um at uh Council of state governments I
 
01:03:19.190 --> 01:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
got a
 
01:03:22.490 --> 01:03:22.500 align:start position:0%
a list of you know what sorts of
 
01:03:25.069 --> 01:03:25.079 align:start position:0%
information a farmer would need to
 
01:03:28.970 --> 01:03:28.980 align:start position:0%
provide in order to apply for re for the
 
01:03:30.770 --> 01:03:30.780 align:start position:0%
reef funding it's the sort of thing
 
01:03:33.970 --> 01:03:33.980 align:start position:0%
where if you were a large
 
01:03:37.010 --> 01:03:37.020 align:start position:0%
and the refunding is available to small
 
01:03:39.650 --> 01:03:39.660 align:start position:0%
businesses small business according to
 
01:03:42.530 --> 01:03:42.540 align:start position:0%
the state into the feds is anything
 
01:03:45.530 --> 01:03:45.540 align:start position:0%
under oh 50 million dollars
 
01:03:45.540 --> 01:03:46.930 align:start position:0%
under oh 50 million dollars
so

01:03:46.930 --> 01:03:46.940 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:03:50.150 --> 01:03:50.160 align:start position:0%
if you are a 50 million dollar rural
 
01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:51.349 align:start position:0%
if you are a 50 million dollar rural
business

01:03:51.349 --> 01:03:51.359 align:start position:0%
business
 
01:03:54.289 --> 01:03:54.299 align:start position:0%
then you can apply for this you can
 
01:03:56.089 --> 01:03:56.099 align:start position:0%
afford to have your accountants figure
 
01:03:59.390 --> 01:03:59.400 align:start position:0%
out all the details if you are a farmer
 
01:04:02.510 --> 01:04:02.520 align:start position:0%
with half a dozen employees
 
01:04:04.549 --> 01:04:04.559 align:start position:0%
you don't have it's much more
 
01:04:06.349 --> 01:04:06.359 align:start position:0%
challenging I talked to couple House
 
01:04:09.049 --> 01:04:09.059 align:start position:0%
Farm which did go ahead with applying
 
01:04:13.250 --> 01:04:13.260 align:start position:0%
for a previous round of funding for for
 
01:04:17.870 --> 01:04:17.880 align:start position:0%
solar stuff and uh and she said that
 
01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:18.490 align:start position:0%
solar stuff and uh and she said that
um

01:04:18.490 --> 01:04:18.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:21.530 --> 01:04:21.540 align:start position:0%
the uh that she had basic had to
 
01:04:23.510 --> 01:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
basically cease all of her farming work
 
01:04:26.690 --> 01:04:26.700 align:start position:0%
for two or three weeks in order to be
 
01:04:29.809 --> 01:04:29.819 align:start position:0%
able to just figure out the paperwork uh
 
01:04:31.910 --> 01:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
that's that's a burden that it would be
 
01:04:35.089 --> 01:04:35.099 align:start position:0%
nice to be able to uh sort of relieve
 
01:04:39.289 --> 01:04:39.299 align:start position:0%
the farmer of and to some extent so uh
 
01:04:41.089 --> 01:04:41.099 align:start position:0%
one of the things that I think is would
 
01:04:44.150 --> 01:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
be a real benefit of this of having a
 
01:04:46.549 --> 01:04:46.559 align:start position:0%
specialist would be to have someone who
 
01:04:50.089 --> 01:04:50.099 align:start position:0%
can help the farmers uh negotiate that
 
01:04:52.670 --> 01:04:52.680 align:start position:0%
reap paperwork
 
01:04:55.069 --> 01:04:55.079 align:start position:0%
oh and the other thing is I I uh
 
01:04:58.730 --> 01:04:58.740 align:start position:0%
speaking with the USDA person uh she
 
01:05:01.970 --> 01:05:01.980 align:start position:0%
said the USDA does not have uh the
 
01:05:03.950 --> 01:05:03.960 align:start position:0%
capacity to assist Farmers with the
 
01:05:06.829 --> 01:05:06.839 align:start position:0%
details however they do have a matching
 
01:05:09.950 --> 01:05:09.960 align:start position:0%
grant program that would allow them to
 
01:05:12.109 --> 01:05:12.119 align:start position:0%
cover some of the cost of a state
 
01:05:14.150 --> 01:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
specialist if we did that
 
01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:15.530 align:start position:0%
specialist if we did that
oh

01:05:15.530 --> 01:05:15.540 align:start position:0%
oh
 
01:05:17.870 --> 01:05:17.880 align:start position:0%
representative come to off
 
01:05:20.870 --> 01:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:05:22.910 --> 01:05:22.920 align:start position:0%
every County
 
01:05:22.920 --> 01:05:24.109 align:start position:0%
every County
um

01:05:24.109 --> 01:05:24.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:27.650 --> 01:05:27.660 align:start position:0%
I can't assume but our County we give
 
01:05:30.890 --> 01:05:30.900 align:start position:0%
money to UNH extension cooperative
 
01:05:33.530 --> 01:05:33.540 align:start position:0%
and they're there to assist all people
 
01:05:35.809 --> 01:05:35.819 align:start position:0%
in the county including Farmers with
 
01:05:38.150 --> 01:05:38.160 align:start position:0%
grants and other things there's also a
 
01:05:40.670 --> 01:05:40.680 align:start position:0%
non-profit agency called score that will
 
01:05:42.950 --> 01:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
help anybody with anything and can help
 
01:05:44.809 --> 01:05:44.819 align:start position:0%
with any grants
 
01:05:46.849 --> 01:05:46.859 align:start position:0%
I don't think we need to add another
 
01:05:49.089 --> 01:05:49.099 align:start position:0%
layer or another person
 
01:05:51.289 --> 01:05:51.299 align:start position:0%
to help with this
 
01:05:53.630 --> 01:05:53.640 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of non-profits out there
 
01:05:56.030 --> 01:05:56.040 align:start position:0%
we have the New Hampshire Farm Bureau we
 
01:05:58.849 --> 01:05:58.859 align:start position:0%
have UNH extension in each County we
 
01:06:02.089 --> 01:06:02.099 align:start position:0%
have score and many others
 
01:06:05.630 --> 01:06:05.640 align:start position:0%
I think that we need to
 
01:06:08.329 --> 01:06:08.339 align:start position:0%
maybe get the information out to people
 
01:06:10.670 --> 01:06:10.680 align:start position:0%
on what organizations are there
 
01:06:14.450 --> 01:06:14.460 align:start position:0%
available to them instead of putting it
 
01:06:16.150 --> 01:06:16.160 align:start position:0%
in another position
 
01:06:19.250 --> 01:06:19.260 align:start position:0%
to do this
 
01:06:20.990 --> 01:06:21.000 align:start position:0%
representative Murray you had your hand
 
01:06:28.130 --> 01:06:28.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:29.870 --> 01:06:29.880 align:start position:0%
Farmers already
 
01:06:33.049 --> 01:06:33.059 align:start position:0%
time to do these applications and
 
01:06:34.789 --> 01:06:34.799 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby is correct that
 
01:06:36.589 --> 01:06:36.599 align:start position:0%
when the application process does go
 
01:06:39.470 --> 01:06:39.480 align:start position:0%
forward in Vermont they can't answer any
 
01:06:41.390 --> 01:06:41.400 align:start position:0%
of those technical questions at all they
 
01:06:43.490 --> 01:06:43.500 align:start position:0%
are actually the person deciding whether
 
01:06:45.650 --> 01:06:45.660 align:start position:0%
or not to Grant the
 
01:06:49.250 --> 01:06:49.260 align:start position:0%
application to the applicant so if these
 
01:06:52.730 --> 01:06:52.740 align:start position:0%
folks are then having to juggle their
 
01:06:54.829 --> 01:06:54.839 align:start position:0%
farming practice or their production
 
01:06:58.010 --> 01:06:58.020 align:start position:0%
side of whatever their value-added
 
01:07:01.069 --> 01:07:01.079 align:start position:0%
product is without those resources we've
 
01:07:02.690 --> 01:07:02.700 align:start position:0%
heard from folks like the Cooperative
 
01:07:04.490 --> 01:07:04.500 align:start position:0%
Extension that yes they would love to be
 
01:07:07.690 --> 01:07:07.700 align:start position:0%
able to help more easily facilitate
 
01:07:10.789 --> 01:07:10.799 align:start position:0%
this process for Farmers they just don't
 
01:07:13.329 --> 01:07:13.339 align:start position:0%
have enough of the funds or
 
01:07:15.710 --> 01:07:15.720 align:start position:0%
infrastructure in place and this grant
 
01:07:18.650 --> 01:07:18.660 align:start position:0%
program would offer that to or this
 
01:07:25.670 --> 01:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:29.210 --> 01:07:29.220 align:start position:0%
uh yes I was a member of score several
 
01:07:33.049 --> 01:07:33.059 align:start position:0%
years ago for several years and
 
01:07:36.349 --> 01:07:36.359 align:start position:0%
um I didn't I'm not sure that they have
 
01:07:37.970 --> 01:07:37.980 align:start position:0%
different branches around the state
 
01:07:40.730 --> 01:07:40.740 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe they do okay so there are
 
01:07:42.910 --> 01:07:42.920 align:start position:0%
branches around the state and there are
 
01:07:45.410 --> 01:07:45.420 align:start position:0%
uh farmers
 
01:07:47.870 --> 01:07:47.880 align:start position:0%
that or people who would have expertise
 
01:07:49.010 --> 01:07:49.020 align:start position:0%
in this area
 
01:07:52.670 --> 01:07:52.680 align:start position:0%
okay because in you know I mean I was
 
01:07:55.309 --> 01:07:55.319 align:start position:0%
only colleagues with a lot of Engineers
 
01:07:58.370 --> 01:07:58.380 align:start position:0%
and and nobody was a farmer so I just
 
01:08:00.650 --> 01:08:00.660 align:start position:0%
want clarification on that that you know
 
01:08:03.170 --> 01:08:03.180 align:start position:0%
if if score does have that expertise
 
01:08:04.549 --> 01:08:04.559 align:start position:0%
then they can be a resource
 
01:08:04.559 --> 01:08:06.109 align:start position:0%
then they can be a resource
representative

01:08:06.109 --> 01:08:06.119 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:08:08.630 --> 01:08:08.640 align:start position:0%
um thank you madam chair I know that in
 
01:08:10.789 --> 01:08:10.799 align:start position:0%
the Belknap area we have a great uh
 
01:08:13.849 --> 01:08:13.859 align:start position:0%
chapter of score and some of them are in
 
01:08:16.610 --> 01:08:16.620 align:start position:0%
the uh industry
 
01:08:24.410 --> 01:08:24.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:26.450 --> 01:08:26.460 align:start position:0%
um if we were to have someone who
 
01:08:29.570 --> 01:08:29.580 align:start position:0%
specialized in just this process then um
 
01:08:31.729 --> 01:08:31.739 align:start position:0%
they can they can serve a broader swath
 
01:08:35.390 --> 01:08:35.400 align:start position:0%
of of farmers and and workers to get get
 
01:08:37.430 --> 01:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
these grants um I work in I work in a
 
01:08:38.930 --> 01:08:38.940 align:start position:0%
professional kitchen and you don't put
 
01:08:41.030 --> 01:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
down one tool until you're finished with
 
01:08:42.950 --> 01:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
that job you move on to the next tool
 
01:08:45.829 --> 01:08:45.839 align:start position:0%
and I think that having uh having a a
 
01:08:47.329 --> 01:08:47.339 align:start position:0%
position like this would give you a
 
01:08:49.729 --> 01:08:49.739 align:start position:0%
sharp tool on that front
 
01:08:52.970 --> 01:08:52.980 align:start position:0%
represent Bixby so
 
01:08:52.980 --> 01:08:53.990 align:start position:0%
represent Bixby so
um

01:08:53.990 --> 01:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:57.050 --> 01:08:57.060 align:start position:0%
the way that Co-operative extension
 
01:09:01.189 --> 01:09:01.199 align:start position:0%
Works uh deals with uh they're advising
 
01:09:03.769 --> 01:09:03.779 align:start position:0%
through the county extensions is they
 
01:09:08.030 --> 01:09:08.040 align:start position:0%
have uh they have field experts who are
 
01:09:11.769 --> 01:09:11.779 align:start position:0%
uh who have different areas of expertise
 
01:09:16.849 --> 01:09:16.859 align:start position:0%
in uh every County those sometimes but
 
01:09:19.249 --> 01:09:19.259 align:start position:0%
sometimes some counties will not have
 
01:09:22.010 --> 01:09:22.020 align:start position:0%
every single area of expertise so for
 
01:09:25.370 --> 01:09:25.380 align:start position:0%
instance uh they're
 
01:09:27.470 --> 01:09:27.480 align:start position:0%
um there are some counties that have
 
01:09:29.630 --> 01:09:29.640 align:start position:0%
someone who is a forest specialist not
 
01:09:33.050 --> 01:09:33.060 align:start position:0%
All Counties have that and they will the
 
01:09:35.090 --> 01:09:35.100 align:start position:0%
the four Specialists will then be
 
01:09:38.030 --> 01:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
essentially loaned to other counties for
 
01:09:41.570 --> 01:09:41.580 align:start position:0%
that purpose uh and uh
 
01:09:43.550 --> 01:09:43.560 align:start position:0%
um so for instance we have our
 
01:09:45.349 --> 01:09:45.359 align:start position:0%
agricultural specialists in Stratford
 
01:09:49.030 --> 01:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
county is a greenhouse specialist and he
 
01:09:51.890 --> 01:09:51.900 align:start position:0%
will travel to other counties where
 
01:09:54.650 --> 01:09:54.660 align:start position:0%
Greenhouse that need Greenhouse advising
 
01:09:59.150 --> 01:09:59.160 align:start position:0%
in order to provide that surface so what
 
01:10:01.130 --> 01:10:01.140 align:start position:0%
this bill would do is it would be create
 
01:10:04.010 --> 01:10:04.020 align:start position:0%
a field specialist with an expertise in
 
01:10:05.870 --> 01:10:05.880 align:start position:0%
energy there is not currently a field
 
01:10:07.930 --> 01:10:07.940 align:start position:0%
specialist with an expertise in energy
 
01:10:11.510 --> 01:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
and by creating effect by creating that
 
01:10:13.669 --> 01:10:13.679 align:start position:0%
field specialist position that person
 
01:10:15.650 --> 01:10:15.660 align:start position:0%
could serve every county in the state
 
01:10:20.390 --> 01:10:20.400 align:start position:0%
and provide really uh you know the
 
01:10:22.550 --> 01:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
provide this
 
01:10:24.649 --> 01:10:24.659 align:start position:0%
um the knowledge that some specialist
 
01:10:27.470 --> 01:10:27.480 align:start position:0%
can provide rather than a generalist
 
01:10:29.870 --> 01:10:29.880 align:start position:0%
representative come to our and then
 
01:10:31.310 --> 01:10:31.320 align:start position:0%
representative Morris thank you madam
 
01:10:34.070 --> 01:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
chair and this is basically directed at
 
01:10:35.930 --> 01:10:35.940 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby
 
01:10:39.530 --> 01:10:39.540 align:start position:0%
um but UNH extension does not need the
 
01:10:41.209 --> 01:10:41.219 align:start position:0%
legislator to direct what field
 
01:10:43.010 --> 01:10:43.020 align:start position:0%
Specialties they have they could do that
 
01:10:46.870 --> 01:10:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:50.930 --> 01:10:50.940 align:start position:0%
the the issue is with the funding so
 
01:10:53.450 --> 01:10:53.460 align:start position:0%
um what this essentially what the
 
01:10:55.130 --> 01:10:55.140 align:start position:0%
amendment that I'm proposing would
 
01:10:56.570 --> 01:10:56.580 align:start position:0%
provide the funding for one field
 
01:11:01.250 --> 01:11:01.260 align:start position:0%
specialist and uh I when I talked with
 
01:11:03.110 --> 01:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
um director Lavallee he said that would
 
01:11:06.530 --> 01:11:06.540 align:start position:0%
probably with the combination of salary
 
01:11:12.470 --> 01:11:12.480 align:start position:0%
benefits and uh and Transportation uh it
 
01:11:14.870 --> 01:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
would require it would be about a a
 
01:11:17.149 --> 01:11:17.159 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars
 
01:11:19.610 --> 01:11:19.620 align:start position:0%
representative Morse
 
01:11:21.350 --> 01:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
good morning good morning thank you
 
01:11:22.610 --> 01:11:22.620 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
01:11:24.410 --> 01:11:24.420 align:start position:0%
um I'm just hearing that it sounds like
 
01:11:27.410 --> 01:11:27.420 align:start position:0%
this is a recommendation by experts and
 
01:11:29.510 --> 01:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
Specialists and so would it not be a
 
01:11:31.669 --> 01:11:31.679 align:start position:0%
slippery slope if we don't listen to
 
01:11:38.290 --> 01:11:38.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:41.390 --> 01:11:41.400 align:start position:0%
anyone else yep
 
01:11:44.090 --> 01:11:44.100 align:start position:0%
representative vote thank you madam
 
01:11:44.100 --> 01:11:44.930 align:start position:0%
representative vote thank you madam
chair

01:11:44.930 --> 01:11:44.940 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:11:47.510 --> 01:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
um I will second uh what representative
 
01:11:49.790 --> 01:11:49.800 align:start position:0%
Morris has said and I think when we have
 
01:11:52.610 --> 01:11:52.620 align:start position:0%
one of the top research universities in
 
01:11:55.130 --> 01:11:55.140 align:start position:0%
this state coming to us and we are
 
01:11:57.649 --> 01:11:57.659 align:start position:0%
reaching out and saying we have an
 
01:12:00.229 --> 01:12:00.239 align:start position:0%
opportunity here to as the environment
 
01:12:02.570 --> 01:12:02.580 align:start position:0%
in agriculture committee for the State
 
01:12:04.189 --> 01:12:04.199 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire
 
01:12:07.430 --> 01:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
to add to bring somebody in
 
01:12:10.970 --> 01:12:10.980 align:start position:0%
from this top university to basically
 
01:12:14.149 --> 01:12:14.159 align:start position:0%
assist Farmers with getting the
 
01:12:16.130 --> 01:12:16.140 align:start position:0%
resources they need in order to be
 
01:12:16.140 --> 01:12:17.570 align:start position:0%
resources they need in order to be
successful

01:12:17.570 --> 01:12:17.580 align:start position:0%
successful
 
01:12:20.510 --> 01:12:20.520 align:start position:0%
I will second that that thought and also
 
01:12:23.870 --> 01:12:23.880 align:start position:0%
add that there definitely could be a
 
01:12:26.330 --> 01:12:26.340 align:start position:0%
slippery slope with that because in the
 
01:12:29.450 --> 01:12:29.460 align:start position:0%
public eye then it looks like wow the
 
01:12:30.950 --> 01:12:30.960 align:start position:0%
environment and agriculture committee
 
01:12:33.350 --> 01:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
had an opportunity to give Farmers the
 
01:12:36.169 --> 01:12:36.179 align:start position:0%
necessary resources and then that did
 
01:12:37.370 --> 01:12:37.380 align:start position:0%
not occur
 
01:12:39.470 --> 01:12:39.480 align:start position:0%
that is all I'm elevating on that level
 
01:12:41.510 --> 01:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair representative
 
01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:44.570 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair representative
smart

01:12:44.570 --> 01:12:44.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:46.550 --> 01:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
um so I looked at that list this morning
 
01:12:46.560 --> 01:12:48.229 align:start position:0%
um so I looked at that list this morning
quickly

01:12:48.229 --> 01:12:48.239 align:start position:0%
quickly
 
01:12:49.729 --> 01:12:49.739 align:start position:0%
I was having my coffee
 
01:12:52.310 --> 01:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
and um I just went through and looked at
 
01:12:55.010 --> 01:12:55.020 align:start position:0%
the one the businesses in my county that
 
01:12:58.070 --> 01:12:58.080 align:start position:0%
I know about and we keep talking about
 
01:13:00.350 --> 01:13:00.360 align:start position:0%
farmers and a lot of those businesses
 
01:13:04.790 --> 01:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
are small businesses they're not farmers
 
01:13:07.430 --> 01:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
um and they've received large sums of
 
01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:09.169 align:start position:0%
um and they've received large sums of
money

01:13:09.169 --> 01:13:09.179 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:13:12.770 --> 01:13:12.780 align:start position:0%
I just and I I
 
01:13:14.450 --> 01:13:14.460 align:start position:0%
um represented
 
01:13:16.910 --> 01:13:16.920 align:start position:0%
Bixby said I don't know it was something
 
01:13:19.669 --> 01:13:19.679 align:start position:0%
about businesses small businesses that
 
01:13:22.729 --> 01:13:22.739 align:start position:0%
earn 50 million or less are allowed to
 
01:13:25.070 --> 01:13:25.080 align:start position:0%
apply for this
 
01:13:25.080 --> 01:13:25.610 align:start position:0%
apply for this
um

01:13:25.610 --> 01:13:25.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:29.030 --> 01:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
I don't know is there a way that we can
 
01:13:32.990 --> 01:13:33.000 align:start position:0%
limit and so that the farmers get first
 
01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.270 align:start position:0%
limit and so that the farmers get first
dibs

01:13:35.270 --> 01:13:35.280 align:start position:0%
dibs
 
01:13:37.430 --> 01:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
um and that you can't I don't I don't
 
01:13:39.649 --> 01:13:39.659 align:start position:0%
know how that works but it seems to me
 
01:13:44.270 --> 01:13:44.280 align:start position:0%
that adding a a person to represent all
 
01:13:47.990 --> 01:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
the counties is going to enlarge not
 
01:13:50.450 --> 01:13:50.460 align:start position:0%
only the government but that that
 
01:13:52.790 --> 01:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
department one person is going to say oh
 
01:13:55.490 --> 01:13:55.500 align:start position:0%
I can't do all the counties and so
 
01:13:58.370 --> 01:13:58.380 align:start position:0%
trying to it will increase that
 
01:14:00.770 --> 01:14:00.780 align:start position:0%
department and
 
01:14:05.750 --> 01:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
in turn increasing our taxes
 
01:14:08.570 --> 01:14:08.580 align:start position:0%
so is there a way that we can
 
01:14:13.130 --> 01:14:13.140 align:start position:0%
lower that amount use those funds and to
 
01:14:16.430 --> 01:14:16.440 align:start position:0%
to support our farmers and and this
 
01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:18.850 align:start position:0%
to support our farmers and and this
venture

01:14:18.850 --> 01:14:18.860 align:start position:0%
venture
 
01:14:23.870 --> 01:14:23.880 align:start position:0%
in Bixby okay so uh the way that the the
 
01:14:26.510 --> 01:14:26.520 align:start position:0%
way that the reap program which is the
 
01:14:29.149 --> 01:14:29.159 align:start position:0%
uh basically rural energy program that
 
01:14:32.530 --> 01:14:32.540 align:start position:0%
that is uh something that is through the
 
01:14:37.189 --> 01:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
USDA and the USDA makes the rules and
 
01:14:39.229 --> 01:14:39.239 align:start position:0%
their rules say this is for Rural
 
01:14:43.130 --> 01:14:43.140 align:start position:0%
operations and any rural business or
 
01:14:46.370 --> 01:14:46.380 align:start position:0%
Farm uh that is 50 million dollars or
 
01:14:49.130 --> 01:14:49.140 align:start position:0%
under is qualified to apply for we can't
 
01:14:52.669 --> 01:14:52.679 align:start position:0%
affect those rules but what we can do is
 
01:14:55.430 --> 01:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
make our Farmers more competitive
 
01:14:58.070 --> 01:14:58.080 align:start position:0%
competitive in the competition for those
 
01:15:00.470 --> 01:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
funds by providing them with the
 
01:15:04.930 --> 01:15:04.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:08.050 --> 01:15:08.060 align:start position:0%
representative smart
 
01:15:10.910 --> 01:15:10.920 align:start position:0%
so the only way would be to raise more
 
01:15:13.790 --> 01:15:13.800 align:start position:0%
money for more taxes to support our
 
01:15:17.570 --> 01:15:17.580 align:start position:0%
small farmers that I mean I don't
 
01:15:20.750 --> 01:15:20.760 align:start position:0%
I I see this as a vicious cycle not
 
01:15:22.610 --> 01:15:22.620 align:start position:0%
helping anybody
 
01:15:22.620 --> 01:15:26.030 align:start position:0%
helping anybody
representative

01:15:26.030 --> 01:15:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:30.229 --> 01:15:30.239 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair basically what it
 
01:15:33.050 --> 01:15:33.060 align:start position:0%
is is hiring someone to write a grant
 
01:15:35.689 --> 01:15:35.699 align:start position:0%
so you're hiring a grant writer uh so
 
01:15:37.430 --> 01:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
that farmers can apply
 
01:15:40.250 --> 01:15:40.260 align:start position:0%
to this reap program
 
01:15:42.830 --> 01:15:42.840 align:start position:0%
or any other program representative
 
01:15:42.840 --> 01:15:44.870 align:start position:0%
or any other program representative
Murray

01:15:44.870 --> 01:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
Murray
 
01:15:46.850 --> 01:15:46.860 align:start position:0%
um thank you madam chair that that was
 
01:15:50.630 --> 01:15:50.640 align:start position:0%
my point I think that um to represent
 
01:15:53.270 --> 01:15:53.280 align:start position:0%
based based on what representative Bixby
 
01:15:55.250 --> 01:15:55.260 align:start position:0%
was saying I think that what we are
 
01:15:56.870 --> 01:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
recognizing is that some of the other
 
01:15:58.430 --> 01:15:58.440 align:start position:0%
Industries and businesses that he
 
01:16:00.709 --> 01:16:00.719 align:start position:0%
mentioned with that income cap have have
 
01:16:03.830 --> 01:16:03.840 align:start position:0%
a leg up on Farmers with the ability
 
01:16:06.709 --> 01:16:06.719 align:start position:0%
um to hire somebody independently
 
01:16:08.870 --> 01:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
um and go out and seek those grants
 
01:16:11.030 --> 01:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
whereas Farmers don't necessarily A have
 
01:16:13.669 --> 01:16:13.679 align:start position:0%
the time nor the extra funds I mean we
 
01:16:15.229 --> 01:16:15.239 align:start position:0%
see that our Farmers sometimes are
 
01:16:17.990 --> 01:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
living on very small budgets here in New
 
01:16:20.030 --> 01:16:20.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I think that this would be
 
01:16:22.250 --> 01:16:22.260 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to present
 
01:16:24.229 --> 01:16:24.239 align:start position:0%
um an additional Resource Bank for them
 
01:16:26.390 --> 01:16:26.400 align:start position:0%
to be able to seek the grants know
 
01:16:28.490 --> 01:16:28.500 align:start position:0%
what's out there and then be able to to
 
01:16:30.950 --> 01:16:30.960 align:start position:0%
access those Okay so
 
01:16:33.830 --> 01:16:33.840 align:start position:0%
I mean in a nutshell I think we're
 
01:16:35.530 --> 01:16:35.540 align:start position:0%
looking to have
 
01:16:40.090 --> 01:16:40.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:43.550 --> 01:16:43.560 align:start position:0%
agency organization whatever
 
01:16:46.510 --> 01:16:46.520 align:start position:0%
dedicated to help our Farmers
 
01:16:48.370 --> 01:16:48.380 align:start position:0%
know about
 
01:16:52.669 --> 01:16:52.679 align:start position:0%
and as get gain assistance for these
 
01:16:54.649 --> 01:16:54.659 align:start position:0%
energy programs
 
01:16:58.850 --> 01:16:58.860 align:start position:0%
the question is does that
 
01:17:01.189 --> 01:17:01.199 align:start position:0%
already exist
 
01:17:04.970 --> 01:17:04.980 align:start position:0%
and I know in Sullivan County we just
 
01:17:06.830 --> 01:17:06.840 align:start position:0%
hired a grant writer
 
01:17:09.649 --> 01:17:09.659 align:start position:0%
and that grant writer is available for
 
01:17:09.659 --> 01:17:11.709 align:start position:0%
and that grant writer is available for
anybody

01:17:11.709 --> 01:17:11.719 align:start position:0%
anybody
 
01:17:15.709 --> 01:17:15.719 align:start position:0%
to specifically municipalities in the
 
01:17:18.410 --> 01:17:18.420 align:start position:0%
county but I would imagine if they
 
01:17:21.350 --> 01:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
put out a you know an individual wanted
 
01:17:23.149 --> 01:17:23.159 align:start position:0%
to get in touch with
 
01:17:26.090 --> 01:17:26.100 align:start position:0%
whoever it is the the person that they
 
01:17:28.669 --> 01:17:28.679 align:start position:0%
could pose a question I'm looking into
 
01:17:30.950 --> 01:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
getting this kind of Grant or do you
 
01:17:33.050 --> 01:17:33.060 align:start position:0%
know of any kind of grants for this so
 
01:17:36.290 --> 01:17:36.300 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering if if this is
 
01:17:36.300 --> 01:17:37.070 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering if if this is
um

01:17:37.070 --> 01:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:39.709 --> 01:17:39.719 align:start position:0%
if this is replicating anything that's
 
01:17:43.490 --> 01:17:43.500 align:start position:0%
already existing and I and it sounds to
 
01:17:46.189 --> 01:17:46.199 align:start position:0%
me that representative comtwa is saying
 
01:17:47.630 --> 01:17:47.640 align:start position:0%
it is
 
01:17:51.410 --> 01:17:51.420 align:start position:0%
as well as representative smart is
 
01:17:51.420 --> 01:17:52.669 align:start position:0%
as well as representative smart is
saying

01:17:52.669 --> 01:17:52.679 align:start position:0%
saying
 
01:17:54.649 --> 01:17:54.659 align:start position:0%
um representative datsey your your
 
01:17:57.530 --> 01:17:57.540 align:start position:0%
comments uh yeah I would you know you
 
01:17:59.630 --> 01:17:59.640 align:start position:0%
know would say if I'm looking at
 
01:18:02.330 --> 01:18:02.340 align:start position:0%
that we would not have any resources and
 
01:18:04.130 --> 01:18:04.140 align:start position:0%
even though you think of Nashua and
 
01:18:06.649 --> 01:18:06.659 align:start position:0%
Manchester and Merrimack as comprising
 
01:18:09.169 --> 01:18:09.179 align:start position:0%
Hillsborough County we have a lot of
 
01:18:12.830 --> 01:18:12.840 align:start position:0%
small farms in Milford and Wilton and
 
01:18:16.370 --> 01:18:16.380 align:start position:0%
Goffstown and on and on and on and they
 
01:18:18.410 --> 01:18:18.420 align:start position:0%
would have no resources because score
 
01:18:20.330 --> 01:18:20.340 align:start position:0%
certainly would not be a resource for
 
01:18:23.870 --> 01:18:23.880 align:start position:0%
them and you know and we our farmers in
 
01:18:27.169 --> 01:18:27.179 align:start position:0%
Hillsborough County rely very heavily on
 
01:18:31.130 --> 01:18:31.140 align:start position:0%
UNH extension so you know
 
01:18:33.709 --> 01:18:33.719 align:start position:0%
for a hundred and ten thousand dollars a
 
01:18:36.830 --> 01:18:36.840 align:start position:0%
year to hire somebody who would have not
 
01:18:39.290 --> 01:18:39.300 align:start position:0%
only the grant writing expertise but the
 
01:18:42.830 --> 01:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
energy expertise you know I think would
 
01:18:45.290 --> 01:18:45.300 align:start position:0%
be a good use of funds the other thing
 
01:18:49.250 --> 01:18:49.260 align:start position:0%
is is that you know our mission here is
 
01:18:53.030 --> 01:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
to support agriculture okay and I think
 
01:18:55.810 --> 01:18:55.820 align:start position:0%
if we can support farmers in in this way
 
01:18:59.229 --> 01:18:59.239 align:start position:0%
it's certainly a good use of our mission
 
01:19:02.810 --> 01:19:02.820 align:start position:0%
did we hear refresh my memory did we
 
01:19:05.149 --> 01:19:05.159 align:start position:0%
hear testimony from the New Hampshire
 
01:19:07.130 --> 01:19:07.140 align:start position:0%
Department of energy as to whether or
 
01:19:10.070 --> 01:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
not they are in a position to help any
 
01:19:12.470 --> 01:19:12.480 align:start position:0%
of our Farmers with that representative
 
01:19:16.130 --> 01:19:16.140 align:start position:0%
Bixby yes they uh they said that they
 
01:19:18.830 --> 01:19:18.840 align:start position:0%
did not have the capacity to do that
 
01:19:21.110 --> 01:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
within within their Department within
 
01:19:22.850 --> 01:19:22.860 align:start position:0%
their department so this is this is
 
01:19:25.550 --> 01:19:25.560 align:start position:0%
basically they said that
 
01:19:28.310 --> 01:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
um it's a program that they they're it's
 
01:19:31.490 --> 01:19:31.500 align:start position:0%
a federal program that they are not uh
 
01:19:33.709 --> 01:19:33.719 align:start position:0%
sort of qualified to
 
01:19:35.689 --> 01:19:35.699 align:start position:0%
um provide the support for there are
 
01:19:38.450 --> 01:19:38.460 align:start position:0%
there are scattered types of support
 
01:19:42.110 --> 01:19:42.120 align:start position:0%
across the state you know some some uh
 
01:19:44.990 --> 01:19:45.000 align:start position:0%
installers might provide this assistance
 
01:19:48.790 --> 01:19:48.800 align:start position:0%
but what what what's lacking is having
 
01:19:51.950 --> 01:19:51.960 align:start position:0%
one person that farmers can go to and
 
01:19:51.960 --> 01:19:53.090 align:start position:0%
one person that farmers can go to and
say

01:19:53.090 --> 01:19:53.100 align:start position:0%
say
 
01:19:55.790 --> 01:19:55.800 align:start position:0%
can you help me figure out what I can do
 
01:19:59.149 --> 01:19:59.159 align:start position:0%
do to improve my uh my energy situation
 
01:20:02.830 --> 01:20:02.840 align:start position:0%
on my farm and get advice and that and
 
01:20:07.010 --> 01:20:07.020 align:start position:0%
the this this field specialist might not
 
01:20:09.709 --> 01:20:09.719 align:start position:0%
do the grant writing on him or herself
 
01:20:13.250 --> 01:20:13.260 align:start position:0%
they might say they might provide they
 
01:20:15.229 --> 01:20:15.239 align:start position:0%
might say okay these are the solar
 
01:20:17.030 --> 01:20:17.040 align:start position:0%
installers that might be able to help
 
01:20:19.090 --> 01:20:19.100 align:start position:0%
you with that grant writing process
 
01:20:21.050 --> 01:20:21.060 align:start position:0%
these are
 
01:20:23.390 --> 01:20:23.400 align:start position:0%
uh these These are the federal funds
 
01:20:25.370 --> 01:20:25.380 align:start position:0%
that might be available for you these
 
01:20:26.570 --> 01:20:26.580 align:start position:0%
are State programs that might be
 
01:20:29.570 --> 01:20:29.580 align:start position:0%
available for you uh these are different
 
01:20:33.229 --> 01:20:33.239 align:start position:0%
aspects of energy on your farm that by
 
01:20:35.930 --> 01:20:35.940 align:start position:0%
working on them together you could get a
 
01:20:39.649 --> 01:20:39.659 align:start position:0%
more effective uh Energy System than by
 
01:20:42.050 --> 01:20:42.060 align:start position:0%
just doing uh putting in solar panels
 
01:20:44.510 --> 01:20:44.520 align:start position:0%
piecemeal and Farm Bureau can't provide
 
01:20:46.790 --> 01:20:46.800 align:start position:0%
that Farm Bureau does not that's not
 
01:20:49.550 --> 01:20:49.560 align:start position:0%
what Farm Bureau does from so
 
01:20:51.410 --> 01:20:51.420 align:start position:0%
um but so what we're looking at is
 
01:20:56.689 --> 01:20:56.699 align:start position:0%
someone who can really provide the uh
 
01:21:00.790 --> 01:21:00.800 align:start position:0%
the advising expertise to help
 
01:21:04.010 --> 01:21:04.020 align:start position:0%
farmers pull together the resources that
 
01:21:06.530 --> 01:21:06.540 align:start position:0%
they need most efficiently and that is
 
01:21:07.610 --> 01:21:07.620 align:start position:0%
something that
 
01:21:10.310 --> 01:21:10.320 align:start position:0%
Cooperative Extension does highly
 
01:21:12.050 --> 01:21:12.060 align:start position:0%
effectively in a number of different
 
01:21:16.310 --> 01:21:16.320 align:start position:0%
fields I so for instance if the The
 
01:21:18.770 --> 01:21:18.780 align:start position:0%
Cooperative Extension forestry expert
 
01:21:21.229 --> 01:21:21.239 align:start position:0%
does not write the forest plant
 
01:21:25.070 --> 01:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
management plan for a Timber owner they
 
01:21:27.709 --> 01:21:27.719 align:start position:0%
say they provide the education to help
 
01:21:29.750 --> 01:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
the far the timber owner
 
01:21:34.689 --> 01:21:34.699 align:start position:0%
know how to select a uh Forest manager
 
01:21:39.530 --> 01:21:39.540 align:start position:0%
uh so in by the same token this field
 
01:21:42.890 --> 01:21:42.900 align:start position:0%
specialist would provide the farmer with
 
01:21:42.900 --> 01:21:44.209 align:start position:0%
specialist would provide the farmer with
the

01:21:44.209 --> 01:21:44.219 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:21:46.130 --> 01:21:46.140 align:start position:0%
with the knowledge that they need in
 
01:21:48.350 --> 01:21:48.360 align:start position:0%
order to pull together the re their the
 
01:21:50.930 --> 01:21:50.940 align:start position:0%
resources as efficiently as possible and
 
01:21:53.870 --> 01:21:53.880 align:start position:0%
another aspect of it is there is a lot
 
01:21:56.270 --> 01:21:56.280 align:start position:0%
of federal money out there that New
 
01:21:58.310 --> 01:21:58.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is missing out on because we
 
01:22:00.290 --> 01:22:00.300 align:start position:0%
don't have the capacity the because
 
01:22:02.270 --> 01:22:02.280 align:start position:0%
people don't know how to do this and
 
01:22:03.770 --> 01:22:03.780 align:start position:0%
they don't know if it's available okay
 
01:22:03.780 --> 01:22:07.370 align:start position:0%
they don't know if it's available okay
representative

01:22:07.370 --> 01:22:07.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:09.410 --> 01:22:09.420 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:22:12.010 --> 01:22:12.020 align:start position:0%
um representative Bixby you mentioned
 
01:22:15.229 --> 01:22:15.239 align:start position:0%
installer and then you mentioned solar
 
01:22:18.709 --> 01:22:18.719 align:start position:0%
so basically is this strictly uh when
 
01:22:20.270 --> 01:22:20.280 align:start position:0%
you're talking about energy efficient
 
01:22:22.490 --> 01:22:22.500 align:start position:0%
are you talking about solar installation
 
01:22:24.770 --> 01:22:24.780 align:start position:0%
and if so
 
01:22:27.530 --> 01:22:27.540 align:start position:0%
if it is solar most of these solar
 
01:22:30.169 --> 01:22:30.179 align:start position:0%
people would know about all these grants
 
01:22:32.030 --> 01:22:32.040 align:start position:0%
and would be more than happy to help the
 
01:22:32.040 --> 01:22:34.370 align:start position:0%
and would be more than happy to help the
farmer

01:22:34.370 --> 01:22:34.380 align:start position:0%
farmer
 
01:22:36.830 --> 01:22:36.840 align:start position:0%
not strictly for solar this is for the
 
01:22:39.950 --> 01:22:39.960 align:start position:0%
entire range of energy uses on the farm
 
01:22:43.130 --> 01:22:43.140 align:start position:0%
and how to uh
 
01:22:45.410 --> 01:22:45.420 align:start position:0%
how to uh
 
01:22:47.930 --> 01:22:47.940 align:start position:0%
basically optimize all those research
 
01:22:50.450 --> 01:22:50.460 align:start position:0%
all the resources available so it's it's
 
01:22:53.570 --> 01:22:53.580 align:start position:0%
not uh figuring out one Niche or another
 
01:22:56.450 --> 01:22:56.460 align:start position:0%
Niche it is looking at looking at it as
 
01:23:00.770 --> 01:23:00.780 align:start position:0%
a global or as a the holistic uh use of
 
01:23:03.169 --> 01:23:03.179 align:start position:0%
energy on the farm and how to
 
01:23:06.110 --> 01:23:06.120 align:start position:0%
uh maximize Energy Efficiency which is
 
01:23:09.590 --> 01:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
not solar solar is Generation uh and
 
01:23:13.610 --> 01:23:13.620 align:start position:0%
also maximize generation and figure out
 
01:23:16.310 --> 01:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
um how you know what resources are
 
01:23:19.189 --> 01:23:19.199 align:start position:0%
available uh and that's
 
01:23:22.250 --> 01:23:22.260 align:start position:0%
having an expert who can provide that
 
01:23:24.770 --> 01:23:24.780 align:start position:0%
education is something that is has
 
01:23:26.930 --> 01:23:26.940 align:start position:0%
proved to be very valuable in different
 
01:23:29.750 --> 01:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
aspects of agricultural and business
 
01:23:33.290 --> 01:23:33.300 align:start position:0%
business planning operations uh using
 
01:23:37.250 --> 01:23:37.260 align:start position:0%
the uh the extension model and I think
 
01:23:40.490 --> 01:23:40.500 align:start position:0%
that it would be very effective to use
 
01:23:43.729 --> 01:23:43.739 align:start position:0%
take advantage of that that extension
 
01:23:45.830 --> 01:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
model to provide this service for the
 
01:23:45.840 --> 01:23:46.790 align:start position:0%
model to provide this service for the
state

01:23:46.790 --> 01:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:23:48.290 --> 01:23:48.300 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Bixby
 
01:23:50.330 --> 01:23:50.340 align:start position:0%
representative Haskins
 
01:23:53.570 --> 01:23:53.580 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair good morning I'm a
 
01:23:55.130 --> 01:23:55.140 align:start position:0%
little confused by this conversation
 
01:23:57.830 --> 01:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
because I've been so impressed over the
 
01:24:00.110 --> 01:24:00.120 align:start position:0%
course the learning curve of my first
 
01:24:03.649 --> 01:24:03.659 align:start position:0%
term about the support for Family Farms
 
01:24:06.530 --> 01:24:06.540 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire this looks to me like
 
01:24:09.410 --> 01:24:09.420 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to embrace something
 
01:24:12.169 --> 01:24:12.179 align:start position:0%
that's going to help our farmers and the
 
01:24:15.229 --> 01:24:15.239 align:start position:0%
department has said they can't do it so
 
01:24:18.770 --> 01:24:18.780 align:start position:0%
let's get somebody who will do it
 
01:24:21.830 --> 01:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:24.310 --> 01:24:24.320 align:start position:0%
well I think just healthy
 
01:24:27.229 --> 01:24:27.239 align:start position:0%
conversation and about various aspects
 
01:24:30.410 --> 01:24:30.420 align:start position:0%
of how and why this should happen and if
 
01:24:31.850 --> 01:24:31.860 align:start position:0%
it should happen and if there's any
 
01:24:35.990 --> 01:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
overlap between other departments Etc is
 
01:24:38.090 --> 01:24:38.100 align:start position:0%
is a good conversation to have so that
 
01:24:39.410 --> 01:24:39.420 align:start position:0%
we're not
 
01:24:43.130 --> 01:24:43.140 align:start position:0%
making decisions that you know may have
 
01:24:45.830 --> 01:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
an unintended consequences or anything
 
01:24:47.330 --> 01:24:47.340 align:start position:0%
else but
 
01:24:49.610 --> 01:24:49.620 align:start position:0%
that just like to clarify that so
 
01:24:51.290 --> 01:24:51.300 align:start position:0%
representative coulon
 
01:24:52.790 --> 01:24:52.800 align:start position:0%
your thoughts
 
01:24:55.790 --> 01:24:55.800 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair yeah so I know we
 
01:24:58.910 --> 01:24:58.920 align:start position:0%
have 4 000 small farms in the state so
 
01:25:01.250 --> 01:25:01.260 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious is there data out there
 
01:25:04.790 --> 01:25:04.800 align:start position:0%
that we know how many of these Farms are
 
01:25:07.850 --> 01:25:07.860 align:start position:0%
interested in solar and how many you
 
01:25:09.729 --> 01:25:09.739 align:start position:0%
know this person that we would bring on
 
01:25:12.590 --> 01:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
how many you know people are they going
 
01:25:15.290 --> 01:25:15.300 align:start position:0%
to be able to serve and uh just
 
01:25:17.330 --> 01:25:17.340 align:start position:0%
particulars like that another concern
 
01:25:20.570 --> 01:25:20.580 align:start position:0%
that I have is that it seems like
 
01:25:23.689 --> 01:25:23.699 align:start position:0%
it's where we could be getting a little
 
01:25:25.970 --> 01:25:25.980 align:start position:0%
loose with what is a farm and what is
 
01:25:28.790 --> 01:25:28.800 align:start position:0%
like a small business so is this
 
01:25:31.729 --> 01:25:31.739 align:start position:0%
you know assistance is this for anyone
 
01:25:34.550 --> 01:25:34.560 align:start position:0%
that wants solar and you know any County
 
01:25:36.470 --> 01:25:36.480 align:start position:0%
or I'm just
 
01:25:38.630 --> 01:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
want to get straight on the details a
 
01:25:41.510 --> 01:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
little bit yeah bring up a good a good
 
01:25:43.490 --> 01:25:43.500 align:start position:0%
point representative colon represent
 
01:25:46.550 --> 01:25:46.560 align:start position:0%
Bixby in your discussions with Mr
 
01:25:49.189 --> 01:25:49.199 align:start position:0%
Lavalley and so and others
 
01:25:52.189 --> 01:25:52.199 align:start position:0%
what is their sense of
 
01:25:53.450 --> 01:25:53.460 align:start position:0%
um the
 
01:25:56.450 --> 01:25:56.460 align:start position:0%
numbers of people they that they would
 
01:25:58.669 --> 01:25:58.679 align:start position:0%
be able to handle with just one person
 
01:26:01.070 --> 01:26:01.080 align:start position:0%
and would is there thought that they
 
01:26:03.410 --> 01:26:03.420 align:start position:0%
might need more than one person to do
 
01:26:05.870 --> 01:26:05.880 align:start position:0%
this uh and so
 
01:26:08.870 --> 01:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
um the sense that I got from uh director
 
01:26:10.910 --> 01:26:10.920 align:start position:0%
of the valley was that
 
01:26:10.920 --> 01:26:12.229 align:start position:0%
of the valley was that
um

01:26:12.229 --> 01:26:12.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:15.770 --> 01:26:15.780 align:start position:0%
one person would be one one full-time
 
01:26:18.770 --> 01:26:18.780 align:start position:0%
person would be capable of doing this
 
01:26:23.050 --> 01:26:23.060 align:start position:0%
and that uh in terms of the numbers
 
01:26:26.930 --> 01:26:26.940 align:start position:0%
the numbers of uh people served and and
 
01:26:28.669 --> 01:26:28.679 align:start position:0%
how that works
 
01:26:28.679 --> 01:26:29.750 align:start position:0%
how that works
um

01:26:29.750 --> 01:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:31.910 --> 01:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
I know that Cooperative Extension has
 
01:26:35.570 --> 01:26:35.580 align:start position:0%
very good numbers on uh how many people
 
01:26:38.270 --> 01:26:38.280 align:start position:0%
their their field Specialists serve in
 
01:26:40.669 --> 01:26:40.679 align:start position:0%
different areas in in different areas of
 
01:26:44.390 --> 01:26:44.400 align:start position:0%
of specialty and uh
 
01:26:47.870 --> 01:26:47.880 align:start position:0%
one of the things that I I don't I don't
 
01:26:49.490 --> 01:26:49.500 align:start position:0%
have those numbers off the top of my
 
01:26:51.590 --> 01:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
head but one of the things that I'm
 
01:26:55.129 --> 01:26:55.139 align:start position:0%
always impressed with when I'm going to
 
01:26:56.209 --> 01:26:56.219 align:start position:0%
my County
 
01:26:57.910 --> 01:26:57.920 align:start position:0%
um working with the county
 
01:27:00.709 --> 01:27:00.719 align:start position:0%
advisory committee for Cooperative
 
01:27:02.270 --> 01:27:02.280 align:start position:0%
Extension is
 
01:27:05.830 --> 01:27:05.840 align:start position:0%
how many contacts the various special
 
01:27:09.770 --> 01:27:09.780 align:start position:0%
Specialists have with uh our New
 
01:27:12.709 --> 01:27:12.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents uh to help them work
 
01:27:14.090 --> 01:27:14.100 align:start position:0%
on their
 
01:27:14.100 --> 01:27:14.750 align:start position:0%
on their
um

01:27:14.750 --> 01:27:14.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:16.910 --> 01:27:16.920 align:start position:0%
the the projects they need to work on
 
01:27:19.550 --> 01:27:19.560 align:start position:0%
you know how many people how many Timber
 
01:27:22.610 --> 01:27:22.620 align:start position:0%
owners the far the Forester helps with
 
01:27:23.930 --> 01:27:23.940 align:start position:0%
how many
 
01:27:26.270 --> 01:27:26.280 align:start position:0%
um how many businesses the business
 
01:27:29.590 --> 01:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
development people work with they are
 
01:27:32.290 --> 01:27:32.300 align:start position:0%
incredibly good at leveraging resources
 
01:27:35.689 --> 01:27:35.699 align:start position:0%
and I think that which is one of the
 
01:27:38.390 --> 01:27:38.400 align:start position:0%
reasons that I think that this could be
 
01:27:43.689 --> 01:27:43.699 align:start position:0%
a real uh powerful assistance for our
 
01:27:48.709 --> 01:27:48.719 align:start position:0%
our state's farmers and uh
 
01:27:51.830 --> 01:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
the in terms of whether it would be
 
01:27:53.990 --> 01:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
strictly Farmers or other rural
 
01:27:58.310 --> 01:27:58.320 align:start position:0%
businesses that is you know uh I had I
 
01:28:00.709 --> 01:28:00.719 align:start position:0%
had envisioned this as being essentially
 
01:28:04.070 --> 01:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
for Farmers but that is something that
 
01:28:07.070 --> 01:28:07.080 align:start position:0%
if we want to expand it to a certain
 
01:28:09.410 --> 01:28:09.420 align:start position:0%
range of rural businesses in terms of
 
01:28:12.050 --> 01:28:12.060 align:start position:0%
people who are sort of the support
 
01:28:14.810 --> 01:28:14.820 align:start position:0%
businesses for Farmers like feed stores
 
01:28:18.350 --> 01:28:18.360 align:start position:0%
Etc that I mean we could look at we
 
01:28:20.709 --> 01:28:20.719 align:start position:0%
could look at that as a as a possible
 
01:28:23.750 --> 01:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
approach to it on but
 
01:28:26.209 --> 01:28:26.219 align:start position:0%
um I think that uh I'm just kind of
 
01:28:27.649 --> 01:28:27.659 align:start position:0%
looking at the clock and thinking we'll
 
01:28:29.570 --> 01:28:29.580 align:start position:0%
probably discuss this as much as we need
 
01:28:32.209 --> 01:28:32.219 align:start position:0%
to discuss it right now and I will work
 
01:28:34.970 --> 01:28:34.980 align:start position:0%
on bringing forward the amendment and uh
 
01:28:37.729 --> 01:28:37.739 align:start position:0%
and we can have a more uh continue to do
 
01:28:41.110 --> 01:28:41.120 align:start position:0%
the discussion when uh it's time to okay
 
01:28:43.669 --> 01:28:43.679 align:start position:0%
fair enough I think we'll we'll just
 
01:28:45.350 --> 01:28:45.360 align:start position:0%
have representative and then
 
01:28:48.350 --> 01:28:48.360 align:start position:0%
representative Murray and uh wrap it up
 
01:28:51.410 --> 01:28:51.420 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh and thank you
 
01:28:53.570 --> 01:28:53.580 align:start position:0%
representative coulin for bringing that
 
01:28:55.669 --> 01:28:55.679 align:start position:0%
um to the Forefront and I would ask
 
01:28:59.209 --> 01:28:59.219 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby in his Amendment
 
01:29:04.189 --> 01:29:04.199 align:start position:0%
to focus on farmers and to identify put
 
01:29:05.629 --> 01:29:05.639 align:start position:0%
in a definition
 
01:29:05.639 --> 01:29:07.129 align:start position:0%
in a definition
because

01:29:07.129 --> 01:29:07.139 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:29:10.370 --> 01:29:10.380 align:start position:0%
as representative coulon mentioned we
 
01:29:13.129 --> 01:29:13.139 align:start position:0%
have over 4 300 Farms listed in in the
 
01:29:13.139 --> 01:29:14.030 align:start position:0%
have over 4 300 Farms listed in in the
state

01:29:14.030 --> 01:29:14.040 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:29:17.270 --> 01:29:17.280 align:start position:0%
and we need to make sure that they are
 
01:29:20.149 --> 01:29:20.159 align:start position:0%
the priority and not someone just in the
 
01:29:22.970 --> 01:29:22.980 align:start position:0%
rural community regarding this program
 
01:29:25.610 --> 01:29:25.620 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Murray thank
 
01:29:27.709 --> 01:29:27.719 align:start position:0%
you madam chair I I also would like to
 
01:29:29.930 --> 01:29:29.940 align:start position:0%
Echo representative kumtot and represent
 
01:29:32.330 --> 01:29:32.340 align:start position:0%
coulon in their desire to have farming
 
01:29:33.950 --> 01:29:33.960 align:start position:0%
well-defined I would also like to see
 
01:29:36.410 --> 01:29:36.420 align:start position:0%
that including things like aquaculture
 
01:29:38.090 --> 01:29:38.100 align:start position:0%
and other types of farming that are not
 
01:29:41.090 --> 01:29:41.100 align:start position:0%
just traditional land use farming so
 
01:29:43.689 --> 01:29:43.699 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about those things
 
01:29:46.129 --> 01:29:46.139 align:start position:0%
I think the real in the realm of what's
 
01:29:47.810 --> 01:29:47.820 align:start position:0%
possible here for New Hampshire and New
 
01:29:50.390 --> 01:29:50.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire farming having access to a
 
01:29:51.830 --> 01:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
resource like this is incredibly
 
01:29:54.350 --> 01:29:54.360 align:start position:0%
beneficial to not only the farmers
 
01:29:56.629 --> 01:29:56.639 align:start position:0%
themselves but the state thank you
 
01:29:58.490 --> 01:29:58.500 align:start position:0%
representative Potenza you are the last
 
01:29:58.500 --> 01:29:59.689 align:start position:0%
representative Potenza you are the last
person

01:29:59.689 --> 01:29:59.699 align:start position:0%
person
 
01:30:01.970 --> 01:30:01.980 align:start position:0%
to speak here
 
01:30:03.950 --> 01:30:03.960 align:start position:0%
so just quick question for
 
01:30:06.470 --> 01:30:06.480 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby so is this entire
 
01:30:08.689 --> 01:30:08.699 align:start position:0%
Bill going to change and actually focus
 
01:30:12.110 --> 01:30:12.120 align:start position:0%
on you know the whole gamut of energy
 
01:30:15.770 --> 01:30:15.780 align:start position:0%
relief and not just solar and then
 
01:30:18.530 --> 01:30:18.540 align:start position:0%
um in regards with this position that
 
01:30:20.510 --> 01:30:20.520 align:start position:0%
you're talking about a field specialist
 
01:30:22.550 --> 01:30:22.560 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:30:24.950 --> 01:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
um costs and all of that type of stuff
 
01:30:27.350 --> 01:30:27.360 align:start position:0%
will be outlined because it as of right
 
01:30:29.750 --> 01:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
now these people that are going to be
 
01:30:32.510 --> 01:30:32.520 align:start position:0%
appointed from the commissioners
 
01:30:34.970 --> 01:30:34.980 align:start position:0%
are just you know experts in the field
 
01:30:37.610 --> 01:30:37.620 align:start position:0%
and all of that that are not being paid
 
01:30:37.620 --> 01:30:40.189 align:start position:0%
and all of that that are not being paid
so

01:30:40.189 --> 01:30:40.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:30:42.649 --> 01:30:42.659 align:start position:0%
this is a Bixby so the amendment will
 
01:30:44.570 --> 01:30:44.580 align:start position:0%
completely rewrite the bill it will no
 
01:30:46.790 --> 01:30:46.800 align:start position:0%
it will not be a task force it will not
 
01:30:49.729 --> 01:30:49.739 align:start position:0%
be people appointed it will be it will
 
01:30:53.930 --> 01:30:53.940 align:start position:0%
simply create a field specialist uh in
 
01:30:57.890 --> 01:30:57.900 align:start position:0%
the in Cooperative Extension who will
 
01:31:03.290 --> 01:31:03.300 align:start position:0%
focus on the entire focus on farms and
 
01:31:06.129 --> 01:31:06.139 align:start position:0%
uh how Farms can
 
01:31:10.090 --> 01:31:10.100 align:start position:0%
optimize their energy uh infrastructure
 
01:31:13.189 --> 01:31:13.199 align:start position:0%
and uh the when I talked with director
 
01:31:15.530 --> 01:31:15.540 align:start position:0%
of Valley last spring he said that the
 
01:31:17.570 --> 01:31:17.580 align:start position:0%
cost of such a specialist would be a
 
01:31:19.450 --> 01:31:19.460 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars including
 
01:31:25.330 --> 01:31:25.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:30.169 --> 01:31:30.179 align:start position:0%
and I might add to that that we did uh I
 
01:31:31.370 --> 01:31:31.380 align:start position:0%
did ask
 
01:31:34.129 --> 01:31:34.139 align:start position:0%
um representative Weiler who is chair of
 
01:31:36.110 --> 01:31:36.120 align:start position:0%
the finance committee whether or not
 
01:31:39.070 --> 01:31:39.080 align:start position:0%
such funding would be available and he
 
01:31:42.590 --> 01:31:42.600 align:start position:0%
enthusiastically said yes for sure
 
01:31:42.600 --> 01:31:43.790 align:start position:0%
enthusiastically said yes for sure
so

01:31:43.790 --> 01:31:43.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:31:46.729 --> 01:31:46.739 align:start position:0%
um with that being said I've also had
 
01:31:48.830 --> 01:31:48.840 align:start position:0%
conversations with other colleagues of
 
01:31:50.330 --> 01:31:50.340 align:start position:0%
mine who have said
 
01:31:52.669 --> 01:31:52.679 align:start position:0%
you know we really give a lot of money
 
01:31:55.370 --> 01:31:55.380 align:start position:0%
to UNH already and I'm surprised that
 
01:31:57.110 --> 01:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
they can't find enough money in their
 
01:31:59.030 --> 01:31:59.040 align:start position:0%
own budget to deal with this without
 
01:32:02.030 --> 01:32:02.040 align:start position:0%
getting more that being said
 
01:32:02.040 --> 01:32:03.669 align:start position:0%
getting more that being said
um

01:32:03.669 --> 01:32:03.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:07.430 --> 01:32:07.440 align:start position:0%
I think I will be interested in seeing
 
01:32:10.070 --> 01:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
the amendment that you you develop
 
01:32:12.970 --> 01:32:12.980 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby and we can leave it
 
01:32:16.669 --> 01:32:16.679 align:start position:0%
as that for now and come back and talk
 
01:32:18.350 --> 01:32:18.360 align:start position:0%
about it
 
01:32:21.709 --> 01:32:21.719 align:start position:0%
um when we when we look at the um
 
01:32:25.610 --> 01:32:25.620 align:start position:0%
at the um the bills that
 
01:32:28.189 --> 01:32:28.199 align:start position:0%
we're gonna dispose of
 
01:32:28.199 --> 01:32:29.810 align:start position:0%
we're gonna dispose of
okay

01:32:29.810 --> 01:32:29.820 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:32:32.810 --> 01:32:32.820 align:start position:0%
thank you for very interesting Lively
 
01:32:34.610 --> 01:32:34.620 align:start position:0%
conversation on all these bills this
 
01:32:37.669 --> 01:32:37.679 align:start position:0%
morning it's very very nice I'm enjoying
 
01:32:37.679 --> 01:32:39.050 align:start position:0%
morning it's very very nice I'm enjoying
this

01:32:39.050 --> 01:32:39.060 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:32:41.990 --> 01:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
um okay HB 493 eliminating the state
 
01:32:44.270 --> 01:32:44.280 align:start position:0%
Meat Inspection program
 
01:32:47.090 --> 01:32:47.100 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby uh this is my bill
 
01:32:48.649 --> 01:32:48.659 align:start position:0%
I don't think it should go forward end
 
01:32:51.550 --> 01:32:51.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:54.410 --> 01:32:54.420 align:start position:0%
short and sweet that's good anyone else
 
01:32:58.490 --> 01:32:58.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:02.270 --> 01:33:02.280 align:start position:0%
okay move on okay so our very last bill
 
01:33:05.590 --> 01:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
that we're going to discuss is hb602
 
01:33:08.870 --> 01:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
relative to landfill citing have we had
 
01:33:12.010 --> 01:33:12.020 align:start position:0%
enough of this topic this year
 
01:33:14.930 --> 01:33:14.940 align:start position:0%
uh representative Bixby
 
01:33:16.729 --> 01:33:16.739 align:start position:0%
um I think that
 
01:33:16.739 --> 01:33:17.450 align:start position:0%
um I think that
um

01:33:17.450 --> 01:33:17.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:19.970 --> 01:33:19.980 align:start position:0%
we saw what happened with our other
 
01:33:24.530 --> 01:33:24.540 align:start position:0%
landfill citing Bill uh and that I I
 
01:33:28.910 --> 01:33:28.920 align:start position:0%
have heard that the Senate are Senate
 
01:33:31.790 --> 01:33:31.800 align:start position:0%
counterparts have no interest in seeing
 
01:33:34.790 --> 01:33:34.800 align:start position:0%
another landfill Bill uh I think that it
 
01:33:36.709 --> 01:33:36.719 align:start position:0%
would not that there's not much use for
 
01:33:39.229 --> 01:33:39.239 align:start position:0%
this one at this point
 
01:33:44.090 --> 01:33:44.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:46.790 --> 01:33:46.800 align:start position:0%
so representative Simon I assumed was
 
01:33:49.550 --> 01:33:49.560 align:start position:0%
going to be here today and he's not and
 
01:33:49.560 --> 01:33:50.390 align:start position:0%
going to be here today and he's not and
so

01:33:50.390 --> 01:33:50.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:33:54.229 --> 01:33:54.239 align:start position:0%
um just in championing for him uh
 
01:33:56.090 --> 01:33:56.100 align:start position:0%
there is going to be Amendment that's
 
01:33:59.629 --> 01:33:59.639 align:start position:0%
going to be put in I believe on 602
 
01:34:03.530 --> 01:34:03.540 align:start position:0%
um and I can read I mean I can literally
 
01:34:05.930 --> 01:34:05.940 align:start position:0%
read what it's going to do and it's
 
01:34:07.970 --> 01:34:07.980 align:start position:0%
pretty much replacing everything that's
 
01:34:09.110 --> 01:34:09.120 align:start position:0%
in here
 
01:34:12.410 --> 01:34:12.420 align:start position:0%
and uh it's it's not going to be us like
 
01:34:15.709 --> 01:34:15.719 align:start position:0%
in a sense a citing Bill and so
 
01:34:15.719 --> 01:34:16.430 align:start position:0%
in a sense a citing Bill and so
um

01:34:16.430 --> 01:34:16.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:18.410 --> 01:34:18.420 align:start position:0%
do you want me to do that or what would
 
01:34:21.290 --> 01:34:21.300 align:start position:0%
you like well as far as I understand and
 
01:34:23.629 --> 01:34:23.639 align:start position:0%
what my colleague representative Compton
 
01:34:26.689 --> 01:34:26.699 align:start position:0%
is telling me that we are the only ones
 
01:34:29.270 --> 01:34:29.280 align:start position:0%
who can put an amendment onto a bill
 
01:34:30.950 --> 01:34:30.960 align:start position:0%
that we are considering that has been
 
01:34:33.649 --> 01:34:33.659 align:start position:0%
retained that someone else in the house
 
01:34:35.930 --> 01:34:35.940 align:start position:0%
can't change that bill
 
01:34:39.410 --> 01:34:39.420 align:start position:0%
so that's true well then maybe I was in
 
01:34:42.330 --> 01:34:42.340 align:start position:0%
Bixby yeah yeah so uh yes the
 
01:34:42.340 --> 01:34:49.129 align:start position:0%
Bixby yeah yeah so uh yes the
[Music]

01:34:49.129 --> 01:34:49.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:53.090 --> 01:34:53.100 align:start position:0%
an amendment on it then uh that is that
 
01:34:54.649 --> 01:34:54.659 align:start position:0%
is entirely your right as a member of
 
01:34:55.850 --> 01:34:55.860 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
01:34:58.669 --> 01:34:58.679 align:start position:0%
and uh if you would like to just tell us
 
01:35:00.530 --> 01:35:00.540 align:start position:0%
briefly what that Amendment would do
 
01:35:02.750 --> 01:35:02.760 align:start position:0%
then um I think we'd be happy to hear
 
01:35:02.760 --> 01:35:06.410 align:start position:0%
then um I think we'd be happy to hear
that

01:35:06.410 --> 01:35:06.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:08.750 --> 01:35:08.760 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to
 
01:35:08.760 --> 01:35:10.250 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to
so

01:35:10.250 --> 01:35:10.260 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:35:13.669 --> 01:35:13.679 align:start position:0%
um my esteemed colleague patenza and I
 
01:35:15.530 --> 01:35:15.540 align:start position:0%
are working on an amendment for this
 
01:35:15.540 --> 01:35:16.910 align:start position:0%
are working on an amendment for this
bill

01:35:16.910 --> 01:35:16.920 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:35:19.610 --> 01:35:19.620 align:start position:0%
um we are extremely concerned about two
 
01:35:23.209 --> 01:35:23.219 align:start position:0%
issues one is transparency
 
01:35:26.090 --> 01:35:26.100 align:start position:0%
and the other is protection
 
01:35:30.790 --> 01:35:30.800 align:start position:0%
so the essence of the amendment will be
 
01:35:35.629 --> 01:35:35.639 align:start position:0%
for Des to have a process that allows
 
01:35:39.649 --> 01:35:39.659 align:start position:0%
the public to to see what they are
 
01:35:44.090 --> 01:35:44.100 align:start position:0%
coming up with that there would be in
 
01:35:46.370 --> 01:35:46.380 align:start position:0%
the spirit of protection
 
01:35:50.510 --> 01:35:50.520 align:start position:0%
some prohibitions to where citing a
 
01:35:52.370 --> 01:35:52.380 align:start position:0%
landfill would be completely
 
01:35:52.380 --> 01:35:54.350 align:start position:0%
landfill would be completely
inappropriate

01:35:54.350 --> 01:35:54.360 align:start position:0%
inappropriate
 
01:35:59.149 --> 01:35:59.159 align:start position:0%
so again protection and transparency and
 
01:36:02.209 --> 01:36:02.219 align:start position:0%
public hearings public comment we're
 
01:36:05.629 --> 01:36:05.639 align:start position:0%
just trying to ensure that the people
 
01:36:07.729 --> 01:36:07.739 align:start position:0%
who will bear the burdens of the
 
01:36:10.070 --> 01:36:10.080 align:start position:0%
decisions we make will have ample
 
01:36:12.830 --> 01:36:12.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity for input will have enough
 
01:36:16.189 --> 01:36:16.199 align:start position:0%
transparency to know what the process is
 
01:36:19.209 --> 01:36:19.219 align:start position:0%
what under what's under consideration
 
01:36:23.270 --> 01:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
and we'll work on the wording and get
 
01:36:26.450 --> 01:36:26.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:26.460 --> 01:36:29.390 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:36:29.390 --> 01:36:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:34.189 --> 01:36:34.199 align:start position:0%
and I'd just like to say that I'm sorry
 
01:36:34.199 --> 01:36:35.390 align:start position:0%
and I'd just like to say that I'm sorry
so

01:36:35.390 --> 01:36:35.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:36:35.400 --> 01:36:36.350 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:36:36.350 --> 01:36:36.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:38.390 --> 01:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
I think that this is a win-win
 
01:36:41.750 --> 01:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
especially for Des and I think it for
 
01:36:43.610 --> 01:36:43.620 align:start position:0%
the most part I'm gonna just read so
 
01:36:45.290 --> 01:36:45.300 align:start position:0%
unlike other states
 
01:36:46.910 --> 01:36:46.920 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire's landfill application
 
01:36:49.850 --> 01:36:49.860 align:start position:0%
process requires that the developer to
 
01:36:52.189 --> 01:36:52.199 align:start position:0%
submit each permit air Wetland Solid
 
01:36:55.189 --> 01:36:55.199 align:start position:0%
Waste in full before Des will review it
 
01:36:57.649 --> 01:36:57.659 align:start position:0%
this can be very costly to developer and
 
01:36:59.750 --> 01:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
to the state as thousands of persons
 
01:37:01.510 --> 01:37:01.520 align:start position:0%
hours in staff time are needed to review
 
01:37:04.850 --> 01:37:04.860 align:start position:0%
a full application therefore like a
 
01:37:06.830 --> 01:37:06.840 align:start position:0%
two-phase permit process will save both
 
01:37:09.110 --> 01:37:09.120 align:start position:0%
private and public money so this bill
 
01:37:12.490 --> 01:37:12.500 align:start position:0%
merely asks Des while it's already
 
01:37:15.709 --> 01:37:15.719 align:start position:0%
revising the relevant regulations to
 
01:37:17.870 --> 01:37:17.880 align:start position:0%
create a preliminary application Phase
 
01:37:20.629 --> 01:37:20.639 align:start position:0%
so that applications that are clearly
 
01:37:23.689 --> 01:37:23.699 align:start position:0%
ill-conceived can be rejected based upon
 
01:37:26.570 --> 01:37:26.580 align:start position:0%
evidence contained in partial permit
 
01:37:28.970 --> 01:37:28.980 align:start position:0%
application those applications deemed
 
01:37:31.189 --> 01:37:31.199 align:start position:0%
plausible can then proceed to a full
 
01:37:33.229 --> 01:37:33.239 align:start position:0%
application which can be processed more
 
01:37:35.330 --> 01:37:35.340 align:start position:0%
quickly than a single phase applications
 
01:37:38.149 --> 01:37:38.159 align:start position:0%
since d es will already have evaluated
 
01:37:40.610 --> 01:37:40.620 align:start position:0%
the basic parameters of the location
 
01:37:43.610 --> 01:37:43.620 align:start position:0%
proposed so because Des already does
 
01:37:45.830 --> 01:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
have this information there's there's
 
01:37:47.090 --> 01:37:47.100 align:start position:0%
certain things that would be an
 
01:37:48.890 --> 01:37:48.900 align:start position:0%
automatic reject which you know our
 
01:37:50.810 --> 01:37:50.820 align:start position:0%
committee does know pretty well so so
 
01:37:52.370 --> 01:37:52.380 align:start position:0%
that's just giving you a little bit of a
 
01:37:55.070 --> 01:37:55.080 align:start position:0%
preview it seems to me though so that
 
01:37:57.770 --> 01:37:57.780 align:start position:0%
you're you would be rewriting the entire
 
01:38:00.350 --> 01:38:00.360 align:start position:0%
Bill why wouldn't you just submit a new
 
01:38:02.229 --> 01:38:02.239 align:start position:0%
bill for next year
 
01:38:05.600 --> 01:38:05.610 align:start position:0%
and scrap this one
 
01:38:05.610 --> 01:38:07.310 align:start position:0%
and scrap this one
[Music]

01:38:07.310 --> 01:38:07.320 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:38:09.470 --> 01:38:09.480 align:start position:0%
represent Bixby yeah
 
01:38:09.480 --> 01:38:10.129 align:start position:0%
represent Bixby yeah
yeah

01:38:10.129 --> 01:38:10.139 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:38:11.750 --> 01:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
um I think that
 
01:38:11.760 --> 01:38:13.129 align:start position:0%
um I think that
um

01:38:13.129 --> 01:38:13.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:16.430 --> 01:38:16.440 align:start position:0%
because the and because what the
 
01:38:18.770 --> 01:38:18.780 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment is would be doing is
 
01:38:23.209 --> 01:38:23.219 align:start position:0%
in fact uh related to the the permitting
 
01:38:27.410 --> 01:38:27.420 align:start position:0%
process uh I and I think this actually
 
01:38:29.810 --> 01:38:29.820 align:start position:0%
uh this is actually a very reasonable
 
01:38:32.570 --> 01:38:32.580 align:start position:0%
thing to do with this bill so I'm so I
 
01:38:33.590 --> 01:38:33.600 align:start position:0%
think that
 
01:38:36.229 --> 01:38:36.239 align:start position:0%
um in terms of why you would do why you
 
01:38:39.770 --> 01:38:39.780 align:start position:0%
would do it uh amend this rather than uh
 
01:38:42.770 --> 01:38:42.780 align:start position:0%
have it you know put submit a new bill
 
01:38:42.780 --> 01:38:43.430 align:start position:0%
have it you know put submit a new bill
um

01:38:43.430 --> 01:38:43.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:47.510 --> 01:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
one aspect of that is that uh it gets it
 
01:38:48.890 --> 01:38:48.900 align:start position:0%
gets us through the process a little bit
 
01:38:51.770 --> 01:38:51.780 align:start position:0%
faster that's right so uh we can if if
 
01:38:53.750 --> 01:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
we choose to to
 
01:38:53.760 --> 01:38:54.530 align:start position:0%
we choose to to
um

01:38:54.530 --> 01:38:54.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:57.410 --> 01:38:57.420 align:start position:0%
to accept this amended bill in our
 
01:38:59.750 --> 01:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
committee it goes to the floor in the
 
01:39:04.010 --> 01:39:04.020 align:start position:0%
house in January instead of uh instead
 
01:39:06.590 --> 01:39:06.600 align:start position:0%
of in February or March it then goes
 
01:39:09.110 --> 01:39:09.120 align:start position:0%
immediately to the Senate so that it
 
01:39:11.570 --> 01:39:11.580 align:start position:0%
will probably save three or four months
 
01:39:15.050 --> 01:39:15.060 align:start position:0%
on the bill process and that's not crazy
 
01:39:18.290 --> 01:39:18.300 align:start position:0%
no except that it would seemed to me
 
01:39:23.810 --> 01:39:23.820 align:start position:0%
that since this is a whole rewrite
 
01:39:26.810 --> 01:39:26.820 align:start position:0%
it hasn't really had a public hearing on
 
01:39:28.390 --> 01:39:28.400 align:start position:0%
on the
 
01:39:28.400 --> 01:39:30.169 align:start position:0%
on the
new

01:39:30.169 --> 01:39:30.179 align:start position:0%
new
 
01:39:32.570 --> 01:39:32.580 align:start position:0%
the new aspects of this bill
 
01:39:35.090 --> 01:39:35.100 align:start position:0%
that would be my only concern
 
01:39:38.090 --> 01:39:38.100 align:start position:0%
representative Murray I'm sorry no thank
 
01:39:43.790 --> 01:39:43.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:46.790 --> 01:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
that there is a connection to the type
 
01:39:46.800 --> 01:39:48.050 align:start position:0%
that there is a connection to the type
of

01:39:48.050 --> 01:39:48.060 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:39:49.430 --> 01:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
information that was brought forward
 
01:39:51.950 --> 01:39:51.960 align:start position:0%
between the committee so representative
 
01:39:53.930 --> 01:39:53.940 align:start position:0%
Bixby I think I mean I'm not opposed to
 
01:39:55.910 --> 01:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
it I'm just questioning it
 
01:39:58.610 --> 01:39:58.620 align:start position:0%
representative Potenza
 
01:40:01.729 --> 01:40:01.739 align:start position:0%
so it's to me it's kind of like this
 
01:40:05.209 --> 01:40:05.219 align:start position:0%
bill talks about what is is
 
01:40:05.219 --> 01:40:06.410 align:start position:0%
bill talks about what is is
um

01:40:06.410 --> 01:40:06.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:08.750 --> 01:40:08.760 align:start position:0%
the mandatory language
 
01:40:11.030 --> 01:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
and instead we're kind of bringing it
 
01:40:13.910 --> 01:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
back to the permissive language so
 
01:40:16.129 --> 01:40:16.139 align:start position:0%
it's really the same bill but it's just
 
01:40:18.290 --> 01:40:18.300 align:start position:0%
leaving the outcome of the agency rather
 
01:40:21.169 --> 01:40:21.179 align:start position:0%
than like prejudging the outcome so it's
 
01:40:24.350 --> 01:40:24.360 align:start position:0%
not totally different but it's just it's
 
01:40:25.910 --> 01:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
instead of going down because they're
 
01:40:27.410 --> 01:40:27.420 align:start position:0%
doing the rule making we're not giving
 
01:40:30.350 --> 01:40:30.360 align:start position:0%
those criteria we're kind of dialing it
 
01:40:33.290 --> 01:40:33.300 align:start position:0%
back a little bit so yes there's
 
01:40:36.110 --> 01:40:36.120 align:start position:0%
difference I understand that but I I
 
01:40:38.450 --> 01:40:38.460 align:start position:0%
still think it's within the same scope
 
01:40:40.790 --> 01:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
that we can do this
 
01:40:43.910 --> 01:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
represent Bixby I think
 
01:40:46.910 --> 01:40:46.920 align:start position:0%
I think they're uh amending it to to
 
01:40:48.709 --> 01:40:48.719 align:start position:0%
this extent would be considered
 
01:40:50.810 --> 01:40:50.820 align:start position:0%
non-germaine we should consult with it
 
01:40:54.410 --> 01:40:54.420 align:start position:0%
with uh the clerk about that and Paul
 
01:40:56.629 --> 01:40:56.639 align:start position:0%
can give us a read on whether we might
 
01:40:58.790 --> 01:40:58.800 align:start position:0%
need to have a new public hearing okay
 
01:41:02.090 --> 01:41:02.100 align:start position:0%
thank you I would do that and so I would
 
01:41:04.729 --> 01:41:04.739 align:start position:0%
look forward to seeing whatever
 
01:41:07.669 --> 01:41:07.679 align:start position:0%
Amendment you come up with and then pass
 
01:41:10.990 --> 01:41:11.000 align:start position:0%
it by the house clerk to see if it is uh
 
01:41:13.970 --> 01:41:13.980 align:start position:0%
substantially different and require uh
 
01:41:16.189 --> 01:41:16.199 align:start position:0%
you know call of whether it's germane or
 
01:41:18.590 --> 01:41:18.600 align:start position:0%
not representative Howard
 
01:41:20.450 --> 01:41:20.460 align:start position:0%
I have a question a question for the
 
01:41:22.910 --> 01:41:22.920 align:start position:0%
writers of this amendment um does that
 
01:41:24.290 --> 01:41:24.300 align:start position:0%
does this preclude
 
01:41:27.169 --> 01:41:27.179 align:start position:0%
um the the criteria are we entrusting
 
01:41:29.330 --> 01:41:29.340 align:start position:0%
the rules to the back to the commission
 
01:41:32.810 --> 01:41:32.820 align:start position:0%
and um and not uh having any
 
01:41:35.209 --> 01:41:35.219 align:start position:0%
requirements about the rules
 
01:41:43.149 --> 01:41:43.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:45.950 --> 01:41:45.960 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry Linda has representative
 
01:41:48.950 --> 01:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
Haskins thank you madam chair
 
01:41:53.030 --> 01:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
um we're giving the department the kind
 
01:41:55.729 --> 01:41:55.739 align:start position:0%
of guidance that we believe they need to
 
01:41:57.229 --> 01:41:57.239 align:start position:0%
write the rules
 
01:41:59.270 --> 01:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
so we're just going to we're going to
 
01:42:02.629 --> 01:42:02.639 align:start position:0%
clarify there's there's not a lot that's
 
01:42:05.750 --> 01:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
new it's just clarifying with language
 
01:42:07.669 --> 01:42:07.679 align:start position:0%
that will help us
 
01:42:10.070 --> 01:42:10.080 align:start position:0%
increase the protection for landfill
 
01:42:10.080 --> 01:42:11.570 align:start position:0%
increase the protection for landfill
citing

01:42:11.570 --> 01:42:11.580 align:start position:0%
citing
 
01:42:22.390 --> 01:42:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:25.129 --> 01:42:25.139 align:start position:0%
I was just going to mention the same
 
01:42:27.169 --> 01:42:27.179 align:start position:0%
thing as representative Murray that the
 
01:42:28.850 --> 01:42:28.860 align:start position:0%
rule making process is already underway
 
01:42:31.250 --> 01:42:31.260 align:start position:0%
and by the time we this gets to the
 
01:42:31.260 --> 01:42:32.689 align:start position:0%
and by the time we this gets to the
floor

01:42:32.689 --> 01:42:32.699 align:start position:0%
floor
 
01:42:34.629 --> 01:42:34.639 align:start position:0%
um they'll already probably be nine
 
01:42:36.890 --> 01:42:36.900 align:start position:0%
months to a year already in the
 
01:42:39.050 --> 01:42:39.060 align:start position:0%
rulemaking process
 
01:42:42.290 --> 01:42:42.300 align:start position:0%
thank you representative germanna
 
01:42:44.450 --> 01:42:44.460 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh I just want to
 
01:42:48.109 --> 01:42:48.119 align:start position:0%
say I look forward to reading the uh um
 
01:42:49.850 --> 01:42:49.860 align:start position:0%
the amendment I for one am not sick of
 
01:42:53.270 --> 01:42:53.280 align:start position:0%
the landfill citing bills uh uh but one
 
01:42:54.770 --> 01:42:54.780 align:start position:0%
of the things that I appreciate and as I
 
01:42:55.910 --> 01:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
said I look forward to seeing the
 
01:42:57.950 --> 01:42:57.960 align:start position:0%
details is that we focused a lot on on
 
01:42:59.689 --> 01:42:59.699 align:start position:0%
the rules and with good reason but I I
 
01:43:01.310 --> 01:43:01.320 align:start position:0%
think we do need to have a conversation
 
01:43:04.550 --> 01:43:04.560 align:start position:0%
about the permitting process itself uh
 
01:43:07.189 --> 01:43:07.199 align:start position:0%
that are there better ways both for
 
01:43:10.970 --> 01:43:10.980 align:start position:0%
applicants and for Des to to operate
 
01:43:13.010 --> 01:43:13.020 align:start position:0%
that permitting process so if it's a
 
01:43:16.310 --> 01:43:16.320 align:start position:0%
staged process uh to take a look at how
 
01:43:18.050 --> 01:43:18.060 align:start position:0%
other states for example conduct their
 
01:43:20.450 --> 01:43:20.460 align:start position:0%
permitting processes so I I in
 
01:43:23.629 --> 01:43:23.639 align:start position:0%
particular I look forward to reading the
 
01:43:26.810 --> 01:43:26.820 align:start position:0%
amendment and and more detail about how
 
01:43:28.490 --> 01:43:28.500 align:start position:0%
the the permitting stages would be
 
01:43:28.500 --> 01:43:30.229 align:start position:0%
the the permitting stages would be
structured

01:43:30.229 --> 01:43:30.239 align:start position:0%
structured
 
01:43:31.790 --> 01:43:31.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:43:33.950 --> 01:43:33.960 align:start position:0%
okay so I just want to get a reading
 
01:43:35.750 --> 01:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
from the committee here
 
01:43:37.970 --> 01:43:37.980 align:start position:0%
um we've mentioned several bills today
 
01:43:41.629 --> 01:43:41.639 align:start position:0%
that would be brought some new
 
01:43:44.090 --> 01:43:44.100 align:start position:0%
amendments would be brought to them do
 
01:43:46.729 --> 01:43:46.739 align:start position:0%
we want to have another work session to
 
01:43:48.830 --> 01:43:48.840 align:start position:0%
review those amendments
 
01:43:52.310 --> 01:43:52.320 align:start position:0%
um and discuss those and then have
 
01:43:52.320 --> 01:43:53.870 align:start position:0%
um and discuss those and then have
another

01:43:53.870 --> 01:43:53.880 align:start position:0%
another
 
01:43:56.570 --> 01:43:56.580 align:start position:0%
um another meeting where we have our
 
01:43:59.930 --> 01:43:59.940 align:start position:0%
actual exec session how does everybody
 
01:44:02.990 --> 01:44:03.000 align:start position:0%
feel about that representing Bixby
 
01:44:04.669 --> 01:44:04.679 align:start position:0%
I think another work session would
 
01:44:07.910 --> 01:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
probably make sense yeah okay and
 
01:44:11.570 --> 01:44:11.580 align:start position:0%
any uh sense of everybody as to what the
 
01:44:13.609 --> 01:44:13.619 align:start position:0%
time frame for those
 
01:44:16.030 --> 01:44:16.040 align:start position:0%
for the for that next meeting should be
 
01:44:20.750 --> 01:44:20.760 align:start position:0%
do you uh do how much time will we need
 
01:44:24.169 --> 01:44:24.179 align:start position:0%
for amendments to be uh drafted and
 
01:44:26.930 --> 01:44:26.940 align:start position:0%
developed on Bixby I'd suggest early
 
01:44:26.940 --> 01:44:28.250 align:start position:0%
developed on Bixby I'd suggest early
October

01:44:28.250 --> 01:44:28.260 align:start position:0%
October
 
01:44:33.910 --> 01:44:33.920 align:start position:0%
okay early October we can have a
 
01:44:36.169 --> 01:44:36.179 align:start position:0%
representative come tomorrow thank you
 
01:44:37.490 --> 01:44:37.500 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
01:44:39.770 --> 01:44:39.780 align:start position:0%
um representative Bixby with OLS being
 
01:44:43.970 --> 01:44:43.980 align:start position:0%
flooded with legisla you know
 
01:44:48.109 --> 01:44:48.119 align:start position:0%
LSR requests this week will these bills
 
01:44:52.850 --> 01:44:52.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:57.229 --> 01:44:57.239 align:start position:0%
oh oh in terms of what so so so so the
 
01:45:00.470 --> 01:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
uh with the amendment process as opposed
 
01:45:03.830 --> 01:45:03.840 align:start position:0%
to the new bills for next term uh I
 
01:45:07.010 --> 01:45:07.020 align:start position:0%
believe that uh certainly we don't want
 
01:45:10.450 --> 01:45:10.460 align:start position:0%
to give them any amendments this week
 
01:45:12.830 --> 01:45:12.840 align:start position:0%
so uh but
 
01:45:16.430 --> 01:45:16.440 align:start position:0%
um but uh starting you know if we if we
 
01:45:19.070 --> 01:45:19.080 align:start position:0%
have the amenities as starting next week
 
01:45:20.930 --> 01:45:20.940 align:start position:0%
as soon as we have the Amendments
 
01:45:23.330 --> 01:45:23.340 align:start position:0%
prepared to the point where uh we think
 
01:45:26.810 --> 01:45:26.820 align:start position:0%
that they're ready to be drafted then uh
 
01:45:26.820 --> 01:45:28.129 align:start position:0%
that they're ready to be drafted then uh
we

01:45:28.129 --> 01:45:28.139 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:45:31.070 --> 01:45:31.080 align:start position:0%
then we can bring them to OLS but I
 
01:45:34.790 --> 01:45:34.800 align:start position:0%
think that it would it would not be uh
 
01:45:40.370 --> 01:45:40.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:43.370 --> 01:45:43.380 align:start position:0%
okay so um perhaps maybe what we can do
 
01:45:46.250 --> 01:45:46.260 align:start position:0%
is uh have another work session on
 
01:45:48.169 --> 01:45:48.179 align:start position:0%
October 24th
 
01:45:50.930 --> 01:45:50.940 align:start position:0%
and then an exact session on the 31st
 
01:45:53.030 --> 01:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
how does that how everybody feel about
 
01:45:53.040 --> 01:45:54.290 align:start position:0%
how does that how everybody feel about
that

01:45:54.290 --> 01:45:54.300 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:45:54.300 --> 01:45:55.729 align:start position:0%
that
or

01:45:55.729 --> 01:45:55.739 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:45:55.739 --> 01:45:57.590 align:start position:0%
or
um

01:45:57.590 --> 01:45:57.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:59.270 --> 01:45:59.280 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:45:59.280 --> 01:46:00.950 align:start position:0%
you know
yeah

01:46:00.950 --> 01:46:00.960 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:46:03.590 --> 01:46:03.600 align:start position:0%
Madam chair can I just I I do believe
 
01:46:05.450 --> 01:46:05.460 align:start position:0%
there was also a subcommittee that is
 
01:46:07.370 --> 01:46:07.380 align:start position:0%
convening in October at some point so I
 
01:46:08.629 --> 01:46:08.639 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure that we weren't
 
01:46:12.350 --> 01:46:12.360 align:start position:0%
right I wanted to go over that as well
 
01:46:12.360 --> 01:46:16.689 align:start position:0%
right I wanted to go over that as well
um

01:46:16.689 --> 01:46:16.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:19.729 --> 01:46:19.739 align:start position:0%
the rules committee uh rule subcommittee
 
01:46:22.010 --> 01:46:22.020 align:start position:0%
is meeting on the 24th
 
01:46:22.020 --> 01:46:22.729 align:start position:0%
is meeting on the 24th
um

01:46:22.729 --> 01:46:22.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:24.770 --> 01:46:24.780 align:start position:0%
but we can work timing on that and
 
01:46:26.570 --> 01:46:26.580 align:start position:0%
adjust it so we could do both meetings
 
01:46:28.310 --> 01:46:28.320 align:start position:0%
same day if that's okay with everyone
 
01:46:28.320 --> 01:46:31.129 align:start position:0%
same day if that's okay with everyone
else

01:46:31.129 --> 01:46:31.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:33.410 --> 01:46:33.420 align:start position:0%
I mean we can also
 
01:46:37.490 --> 01:46:37.500 align:start position:0%
we can also do uh October 24th of a for
 
01:46:38.629 --> 01:46:38.639 align:start position:0%
our next
 
01:46:38.639 --> 01:46:39.590 align:start position:0%
our next
um

01:46:39.590 --> 01:46:39.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:43.850 --> 01:46:43.860 align:start position:0%
work session and then do an exec session
 
01:46:45.649 --> 01:46:45.659 align:start position:0%
on the seventh because I don't know if
 
01:46:47.990 --> 01:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
people have children they want to go
 
01:46:49.790 --> 01:46:49.800 align:start position:0%
Halloween trick-or-treating with and
 
01:46:53.229 --> 01:46:53.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:56.750 --> 01:46:56.760 align:start position:0%
where's our deadline
 
01:47:03.410 --> 01:47:03.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:07.070 --> 01:47:07.080 align:start position:0%
uh yes I'm doing uh committee stuff on
 
01:47:08.510 --> 01:47:08.520 align:start position:0%
on election days
 
01:47:11.990 --> 01:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
all right well I guess we can do exec
 
01:47:13.370 --> 01:47:13.380 align:start position:0%
sessions not going to take very long
 
01:47:17.030 --> 01:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
anyway so if we did October 31st we
 
01:47:18.950 --> 01:47:18.960 align:start position:0%
could just do that early in the morning
 
01:47:21.530 --> 01:47:21.540 align:start position:0%
take care of the six bills and
 
01:47:24.770 --> 01:47:24.780 align:start position:0%
representative Contour Madam chair
 
01:47:26.570 --> 01:47:26.580 align:start position:0%
um I agree that we need another work
 
01:47:26.580 --> 01:47:27.709 align:start position:0%
um I agree that we need another work
session

01:47:27.709 --> 01:47:27.719 align:start position:0%
session
 
01:47:29.870 --> 01:47:29.880 align:start position:0%
but do you think the work session will
 
01:47:31.669 --> 01:47:31.679 align:start position:0%
take all day on the 24th and if not
 
01:47:33.350 --> 01:47:33.360 align:start position:0%
could we just do the exact session in
 
01:47:39.530 --> 01:47:39.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:42.590 --> 01:47:42.600 align:start position:0%
okay then we'll do that
 
01:47:44.510 --> 01:47:44.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for that suggestion
 
01:47:46.310 --> 01:47:46.320 align:start position:0%
representative Murray comment over here
 
01:47:48.470 --> 01:47:48.480 align:start position:0%
yeah I just wanted to make sure show for
 
01:47:50.149 --> 01:47:50.159 align:start position:0%
our own planning purposes if we choose
 
01:47:52.790 --> 01:47:52.800 align:start position:0%
to condense all three meetings into one
 
01:47:54.770 --> 01:47:54.780 align:start position:0%
day it would be the Rules meeting it
 
01:47:56.750 --> 01:47:56.760 align:start position:0%
would be our work session and then the
 
01:48:00.530 --> 01:48:00.540 align:start position:0%
exact that would be a full day correct
 
01:48:02.149 --> 01:48:02.159 align:start position:0%
I'm saying you want to have a you're
 
01:48:04.250 --> 01:48:04.260 align:start position:0%
going to want to have a caucus in
 
01:48:07.189 --> 01:48:07.199 align:start position:0%
between they're they're I'm sorry man
 
01:48:07.199 --> 01:48:08.870 align:start position:0%
between they're they're I'm sorry man
charity

01:48:08.870 --> 01:48:08.880 align:start position:0%
charity
 
01:48:10.850 --> 01:48:10.860 align:start position:0%
representative Murray's exactly right if
 
01:48:13.250 --> 01:48:13.260 align:start position:0%
we did the rules
 
01:48:16.250 --> 01:48:16.260 align:start position:0%
than the uh discussion and then the
 
01:48:19.490 --> 01:48:19.500 align:start position:0%
exact you're probably just looking at
 
01:48:20.570 --> 01:48:20.580 align:start position:0%
this they're going to be two or three
 
01:48:22.010 --> 01:48:22.020 align:start position:0%
bills here we're going to want to have a
 
01:48:24.890 --> 01:48:24.900 align:start position:0%
a caucus on so you add that in there and
 
01:48:27.910 --> 01:48:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:29.930 --> 01:48:29.940 align:start position:0%
you know just get ready get a good
 
01:48:31.189 --> 01:48:31.199 align:start position:0%
night's sleep beforehand because that'll
 
01:48:32.810 --> 01:48:32.820 align:start position:0%
be a long day could could we do the work
 
01:48:41.330 --> 01:48:41.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:44.450 --> 01:48:44.460 align:start position:0%
um well we could we could do a committee
 
01:48:47.689 --> 01:48:47.699 align:start position:0%
meeting work session on the 17th
 
01:48:47.699 --> 01:48:49.609 align:start position:0%
meeting work session on the 17th
although

01:48:49.609 --> 01:48:49.619 align:start position:0%
although
 
01:48:51.590 --> 01:48:51.600 align:start position:0%
um representative Creighton would not be
 
01:48:53.990 --> 01:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
able to attend that
 
01:49:07.010 --> 01:49:07.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:10.129 --> 01:49:10.139 align:start position:0%

and represent Bixby yeah um so if we're
 
01:51:13.550 --> 01:51:13.560 align:start position:0%
moving moving on to a different topic uh
 
01:51:15.229 --> 01:51:15.239 align:start position:0%
if that's available if we can do that
 
01:51:16.430 --> 01:51:16.440 align:start position:0%
right now
 
01:51:18.950 --> 01:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to mention that um I
 
01:51:21.350 --> 01:51:21.360 align:start position:0%
have put in a bill that will
 
01:51:25.910 --> 01:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
uh provide for a position and a half in
 
01:51:27.410 --> 01:51:27.420 align:start position:0%
the Department of Agriculture for
 
01:51:31.310 --> 01:51:31.320 align:start position:0%
Organic certification uh because the
 
01:51:34.970 --> 01:51:34.980 align:start position:0%
um the commissioner is concerned that uh
 
01:51:34.980 --> 01:51:36.229 align:start position:0%
um the commissioner is concerned that uh
the

01:51:36.229 --> 01:51:36.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:51:38.390 --> 01:51:38.400 align:start position:0%
um the current the current way that
 
01:51:41.510 --> 01:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
things are set up is likely to
 
01:51:43.430 --> 01:51:43.440 align:start position:0%
um cause a loss of certification in
 
01:51:46.669 --> 01:51:46.679 align:start position:0%
through in the department uh and we had
 
01:51:51.229 --> 01:51:51.239 align:start position:0%
a there was a listening session uh with
 
01:51:52.870 --> 01:51:52.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire nofa
 
01:51:57.050 --> 01:51:57.060 align:start position:0%
organic Farmers Association uh last
 
01:52:01.010 --> 01:52:01.020 align:start position:0%
night and I was extremely impressed with
 
01:52:05.570 --> 01:52:05.580 align:start position:0%
how strongly the uh the organic farmers
 
01:52:08.030 --> 01:52:08.040 align:start position:0%
want our Department of Agriculture to
 
01:52:10.850 --> 01:52:10.860 align:start position:0%
maintain that certification program and
 
01:52:13.850 --> 01:52:13.860 align:start position:0%
not be not have to go to other sources
 
01:52:15.290 --> 01:52:15.300 align:start position:0%
for that
 
01:52:19.550 --> 01:52:19.560 align:start position:0%
um there was a just a a real strong
 
01:52:21.770 --> 01:52:21.780 align:start position:0%
sense of support for how well our
 
01:52:23.990 --> 01:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
department is currently doing that and
 
01:52:26.930 --> 01:52:26.940 align:start position:0%
the fact that our department is highly
 
01:52:31.370 --> 01:52:31.380 align:start position:0%
accessible and they are very uh you know
 
01:52:34.550 --> 01:52:34.560 align:start position:0%
having that New Hampshire seal of uh
 
01:52:36.290 --> 01:52:36.300 align:start position:0%
certification is something that means a
 
01:52:38.270 --> 01:52:38.280 align:start position:0%
lot to them in terms of both pride and
 
01:52:40.910 --> 01:52:40.920 align:start position:0%
marketing uh so
 
01:52:43.189 --> 01:52:43.199 align:start position:0%
um that's something that so if you have
 
01:52:46.510 --> 01:52:46.520 align:start position:0%
constituents who are organic farmers uh
 
01:52:48.830 --> 01:52:48.840 align:start position:0%
they may be getting in touch with you
 
01:52:51.109 --> 01:52:51.119 align:start position:0%
let them know that that bill is in
 
01:52:54.770 --> 01:52:54.780 align:start position:0%
process and that uh providing their
 
01:52:56.930 --> 01:52:56.940 align:start position:0%
support for that bill is a way to to
 
01:52:58.250 --> 01:52:58.260 align:start position:0%
help keep
 
01:52:58.260 --> 01:52:59.149 align:start position:0%

an effort for each committee
 
01:53:47.590 --> 01:53:47.600 align:start position:0%

be a huge undertaking it's probably
 
01:53:58.910 --> 01:53:58.920 align:start position:0%
going to not just take our term but
 
01:54:02.629 --> 01:54:02.639 align:start position:0%
maybe spill into other terms
