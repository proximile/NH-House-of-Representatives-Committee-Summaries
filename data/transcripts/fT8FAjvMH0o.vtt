00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 align:start position:0%
oara I just allowed um representative
 
00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 align:start position:0%
lean to to
 
00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 align:start position:0%
speak good
 
00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 align:start position:0%
morning gu here I
 
00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
am uh good morning uh my name is Peter
 
00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:33.799 align:start position:0%
lechman I represent Hillsboro 24 and I'm
 
00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 align:start position:0%
here to speak in favor of House Bill
 
00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:41.079 align:start position:0%
352 I brought this bill forward after a
 
00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 align:start position:0%
friend of mine and her family were
 
00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:46.119 align:start position:0%
sideswiped by a very large RV uh an RV
 
00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
that was just under the
 
00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 align:start position:0%
26,000 weight limit for uh commercial
 
00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.040 align:start position:0%
vehicles and their dismay and many
 
00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 align:start position:0%
others after the accident they learned
 
00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 align:start position:0%
that uh there was no requirement for any
 
00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 align:start position:0%
special training or uh oversight of
 
00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 align:start position:0%
anyone getting a license just a regular
 
00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:06.039 align:start position:0%
passenger car license to drive such a
 
00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 align:start position:0%
large vehicle so I reached out to
 
00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 align:start position:0%
commissioner Quinn we had a meeting back
 
00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 align:start position:0%
in January around the 25th I believe and
 
00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 align:start position:0%
uh he asked that I'd get together some
 
00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 align:start position:0%
information to see what would work
 
00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 align:start position:0%
whether the department would be in favor
 
00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 align:start position:0%
of such a move to require any sort of uh
 
00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 align:start position:0%
training or at least a skill test to
 
00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 align:start position:0%
operate such a vehicle so thanks to
 
00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:35.879 align:start position:0%
legislative services and research they
 
00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 align:start position:0%
put together quite a package that was
 
00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 align:start position:0%
delivered to the Department of Safety
 
00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 align:start position:0%
back in
 
00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 align:start position:0%
February and uh unfortunately I have to
 
00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 align:start position:0%
report that um as of yesterday I did
 
00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 align:start position:0%
hear from Elizabeth over at DMV she
 
00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 align:start position:0%
called triy to leave a message uh I
 
00:02:54.869 --> 00:02:54.879 align:start position:0%
reached out to her her voicemail was
 
00:02:57.589 --> 00:02:57.599 align:start position:0%
full so I'm not really sure where the
 
00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 align:start position:0%
department stands on the issue because
 
00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 align:start position:0%
so we've had not connected since our uh
 
00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 align:start position:0%
discussion back in January so I did
 
00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
reach out to the department Monday and
 
00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 align:start position:0%
again Tuesday to inform them of the
 
00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 align:start position:0%
upcoming meeting today or hearing on the
 
00:03:15.149 --> 00:03:15.159 align:start position:0%
bill but again Elizabeth did reach out
 
00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
to me from the DMV yesterday but we
 
00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 align:start position:0%
never did connect so hopefully she's uh
 
00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 align:start position:0%
part of this uh hearing but so those are
 
00:03:26.589 --> 00:03:26.599 align:start position:0%
my reasoning I did provide some
 
00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 align:start position:0%
documents I want to thank representative
 
00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 align:start position:0%
Aaron for
 
00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 align:start position:0%
um notifying me last night that uh they
 
00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 align:start position:0%
did not come through hopefully Rebecca
 
00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 align:start position:0%
got them through today but the types of
 
00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 align:start position:0%
vehicles that I would be looking to see
 
00:03:42.149 --> 00:03:42.159 align:start position:0%
that there'd be at least some kind of
 
00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 align:start position:0%
skill test are the large vehicle that I
 
00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 align:start position:0%
show in a one of the documents I sent
 
00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 align:start position:0%
along this morning and then uh there's
 
00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:54.799 align:start position:0%
also a list of states a document that
 
00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 align:start position:0%
can uh has two pages that list the
 
00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 align:start position:0%
states that do require at least some
 
00:04:03.429 --> 00:04:03.439 align:start position:0%
kind of a skill test for uh large
 
00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.360 align:start position:0%
recreational vehicles so I guess that's
 
00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:08.159 align:start position:0%
all I have for my testimony and thank
 
00:04:11.789 --> 00:04:11.799 align:start position:0%
you thank you um did you say there were
 
00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 align:start position:0%
two states um that currently have these
 
00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:16.479 align:start position:0%
types of
 
00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:19.519 align:start position:0%
regulations uh the document I sent Mr
 
00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 align:start position:0%
chairman there um I can read them off
 
00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 align:start position:0%
California Illinois Kansas Maryland
 
00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 align:start position:0%
Nevada North Carolina Pennsylvania
 
00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 align:start position:0%
South Carolina Texas and Wyoming they
 
00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 align:start position:0%
all have some kind of a skill test for
 
00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 align:start position:0%
such Vehicles some have a Knowledge Test
 
00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
um or an a some also have an affidavit
 
00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 align:start position:0%
for the ability to operate such a
 
00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:47.199 align:start position:0%
vehicle so there's there's quite a few
 
00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 align:start position:0%
states that at least require some kind
 
00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
of a skill
 
00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 align:start position:0%
test thank you any questions from
 
00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:59.749 --> 00:04:59.759 align:start position:0%
committee represent thank you thank you
 
00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360 align:start position:0%
very much Mr
 
00:05:04.029 --> 00:05:04.039 align:start position:0%
chair uh representative lean thank you
 
00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:05.960 align:start position:0%
so much for your testimony this morning
 
00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:08.560 align:start position:0%
I'm interested to know uh do you have
 
00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:12.440 align:start position:0%
any kind of Statistics as to how many
 
00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:15.520 align:start position:0%
accidents uh that were caused by RVs in
 
00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:18.639 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire perhaps in the past three
 
00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:21.479 align:start position:0%
years I do not I know that's a figure
 
00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:23.440 align:start position:0%
that the department of safety has they
 
00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000 align:start position:0%
have uh accident records on all sorts of
 
00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:29.080 align:start position:0%
vehicles but I specifically do not have
 
00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:30.400 align:start position:0%
that number
 
00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:31.790 align:start position:0%
that number
thank

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:34.479 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:05:36.749 --> 00:05:36.759 align:start position:0%
Donovan yes uh thank you Mr chairman
 
00:05:39.029 --> 00:05:39.039 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr lean for being here today
 
00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:41.280 align:start position:0%
um are so are you thinking like this
 
00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:42.520 align:start position:0%
would be somewhat similar to a
 
00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:45.440 align:start position:0%
motorcycle license and there' be uh an
 
00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:48.479 align:start position:0%
endorsement on the license that your RV
 
00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:50.800 align:start position:0%
or your recreational vehicle pass or
 
00:05:53.029 --> 00:05:53.039 align:start position:0%
something similar I would because
 
00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:55.199 align:start position:0%
certainly as you probably well know your
 
00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:57.120 align:start position:0%
committee certainly knows as well just
 
00:05:59.150 --> 00:05:59.160 align:start position:0%
to operate a motorcycle does require a
 
00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:02.360 align:start position:0%
skill set um so something similar to
 
00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:04.000 align:start position:0%
that I think would be something that I
 
00:06:06.629 --> 00:06:06.639 align:start position:0%
would be looking for or certainly the
 
00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:08.479 align:start position:0%
committee might have even better ideas
 
00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:10.960 align:start position:0%
or the department of safety but I think
 
00:06:12.749 --> 00:06:12.759 align:start position:0%
at least there should be some kind of a
 
00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:15.680 align:start position:0%
skill set test for operating such a
 
00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:19.000 align:start position:0%
large vehicle and as I think not as a
 
00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:22.120 align:start position:0%
rule but for the most part U most the
 
00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:24.520 align:start position:0%
people operating these vehicles are
 
00:06:27.029 --> 00:06:27.039 align:start position:0%
retired and uh again they're big and
 
00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:29.840 align:start position:0%
bulky and if you're operating a similar
 
00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:32.800 align:start position:0%
vehicle in a commercial service you're
 
00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:34.840 align:start position:0%
required to have a license so it seems
 
00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:38.080 align:start position:0%
like a uh a standard that we should at
 
00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:39.800 align:start position:0%
least address that way because someone
 
00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:41.639 align:start position:0%
operating again a commercial vehicle has
 
00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:43.240 align:start position:0%
to have a license for something this
 
00:06:45.749 --> 00:06:45.759 align:start position:0%
large but operating a large recreational
 
00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:48.680 align:start position:0%
vehicle there's no skill set
 
00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:51.520 align:start position:0%
required thanks for
 
00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:53.840 align:start position:0%
your representative
 
00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:56.240 align:start position:0%
tki thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:06:59.830 --> 00:06:59.840 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question um
 
00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:01.520 align:start position:0%
before we started this morning I quickly
 
00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:03.360 align:start position:0%
looked into motor vehicle definitions
 
00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:07.080 align:start position:0%
for recreational vehicles and thought I
 
00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:10.560 align:start position:0%
found it well I did find it um in RSA
 
00:07:12.589 --> 00:07:12.599 align:start position:0%
259 colon
 
00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:16.360 align:start position:0%
84 um DOA but then I'm looking up at
 
00:07:21.309 --> 00:07:21.319 align:start position:0%
your bill and it has a definition in RSA
 
00:07:21.319 --> 00:07:22.869 align:start position:0%
your bill and it has a definition in RSA
26-

00:07:22.869 --> 00:07:22.879 align:start position:0%
26-
 
00:07:27.309 --> 00:07:27.319 align:start position:0%
i1 uh number eight and they're very
 
00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:29.160 align:start position:0%
different well not very different but
 
00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
the one cited in your bill is under Park
 
00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:35.800 align:start position:0%
and Parks and Recreation and it's seems
 
00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:36.840 align:start position:0%
much more
 
00:07:39.629 --> 00:07:39.639 align:start position:0%
detailed the first one that I found is
 
00:07:44.629 --> 00:07:44.639 align:start position:0%
in motor vehicle um statutes and it's
 
00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:47.680 align:start position:0%
pretty simple um and it says
 
00:07:50.589 --> 00:07:50.599 align:start position:0%
self-propelled or towed vehicles that
 
00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:52.280 align:start position:0%
serve as a temporary living quarters
 
00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:54.840 align:start position:0%
that's me paraphrasing and I guess my
 
00:07:57.469 --> 00:07:57.479 align:start position:0%
question would be um based on your

about the vehicles being towed or the
 
00:08:51.509 --> 00:08:51.519 align:start position:0%
very large vehicles I was specifically
 
00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:53.640 align:start position:0%
looking for the very large vehicles that
 
00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:55.360 align:start position:0%
are you know very close to the
 
00:08:59.710 --> 00:08:59.720 align:start position:0%
26,000 pound limit um and and again
 
00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:01.880 align:start position:0%
meeting with commissioner Quinn I
 
00:09:03.509 --> 00:09:03.519 align:start position:0%
thought the best people to make that
 
00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:10.160 align:start position:0%
safety followup Mr chairman sure follow
 
00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:12.600 align:start position:0%
up thank you uh representative lean the
 
00:09:14.829 --> 00:09:14.839 align:start position:0%
first part of my question um just
 
00:09:17.069 --> 00:09:17.079 align:start position:0%
pointed out that I found two different
 
00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:19.000 align:start position:0%
definitions for recreational vehicles
 
00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:21.000 align:start position:0%
the one that you cite in your bill is
 
00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:22.920 align:start position:0%
under Parks and Recreation and is rather
 
00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:25.240 align:start position:0%
detailed U but the one I found first
 
00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:26.440 align:start position:0%
because I was looking at motor vehicle
 
00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:31.320 align:start position:0%
law was much briefer uh 259 col 884 um.
 
00:09:35.269 --> 00:09:35.279 align:start position:0%
a and um I just wanted to point that out
 
00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:39.480 align:start position:0%
in case um we need to clarify uh in your
 
00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
bill what vehicles we're referring to
 
00:09:44.509 --> 00:09:44.519 align:start position:0%
not really a question but I think that's
 
00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:47.200 align:start position:0%
it all right thanks thanks for pointing
 
00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:48.269 align:start position:0%

Vehicles good morning Mr chairman
 
00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
members of the transportation committee
 
00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
happy Friday to all of you um for the
 
00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
record my name is Elizabeth Bei I am the
 
00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:30.880 align:start position:0%
director of motor vehicles um thank you
 
00:11:32.269 --> 00:11:32.279 align:start position:0%
for the opportunity to speak on this
 
00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
bill the department is taking a neutral
 
00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:36.240 align:start position:0%
position on this bill we're happy to
 
00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:38.600 align:start position:0%
work with the committee and um
 
00:11:41.069 --> 00:11:41.079 align:start position:0%
representative Lehman on this as well um
 
00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:43.000 align:start position:0%
just a few questions or concerns and I
 
00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:45.480 align:start position:0%
think um representative torki pointed
 
00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:47.360 align:start position:0%
out one of them which is the definition
 
00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:49.880 align:start position:0%
of recreational vehicles my other
 
00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:53.000 align:start position:0%
concern is that leaving the policy
 
00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:55.360 align:start position:0%
decision to rule making is a bit
 
00:11:57.269 --> 00:11:57.279 align:start position:0%
concerning um I would look for the
 
00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:00.360 align:start position:0%
committee to clarify a solution to this
 
00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:01.800 align:start position:0%
whether it's an
 
00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:04.480 align:start position:0%
endorsement um or some kind of testing
 
00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:07.480 align:start position:0%
that would be required for this um
 
00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
because I think that unfortunately
 
00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:11.880 align:start position:0%
leaving it to rul making would exceed
 
00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:14.000 align:start position:0%
our authority to do that or to Define
 
00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:15.920 align:start position:0%
how we would um how this would be
 
00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:17.880 align:start position:0%
applicable to recreational vehicles so I
 
00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:19.160 align:start position:0%
would just be looking for some more
 
00:12:21.629 --> 00:12:21.639 align:start position:0%
specificity in law that would then allow
 
00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:24.880 align:start position:0%
us to introduce that in Ru
 
00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:27.240 align:start position:0%
making and with that I'm I'm happy to
 
00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:29.120 align:start position:0%
answer any questions that you might have
 
00:12:33.069 --> 00:12:33.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:36.160 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you director
 
00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:38.440 align:start position:0%

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:40.350 align:start position:0%
oh oh wait a minute I apologize
represent

00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:40.360 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:42.800 align:start position:0%
tki thank you I'm sorry I was a little
 
00:12:45.269 --> 00:12:45.279 align:start position:0%
late um director bki thank you for
 
00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:48.120 align:start position:0%
taking my question can you give us
 
00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
another example um that may be similar
 
00:12:55.629 --> 00:12:55.639 align:start position:0%
to this where um the department has
 
00:12:58.829 --> 00:12:58.839 align:start position:0%
taken that role in establishing what the
 
00:13:02.069 --> 00:13:02.079 align:start position:0%
endorsement might be just to understand
 
00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:04.120 align:start position:0%
the role between the legislature and the
 
00:13:06.509 --> 00:13:06.519 align:start position:0%
um Department of Safety absolutely we
 
00:13:08.829 --> 00:13:08.839 align:start position:0%
have a number of Licensing endorsements
 
00:13:10.509 --> 00:13:10.519 align:start position:0%
that you can have on on your license I
 
00:13:12.069 --> 00:13:12.079 align:start position:0%
think someone mentioned a motorcycle
 
00:13:14.509 --> 00:13:14.519 align:start position:0%
endorsement so again it requires that
 
00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:16.760 align:start position:0%
you have that Base operator level driver
 
00:13:18.509 --> 00:13:18.519 align:start position:0%
license and then you have an endorsement
 
00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
to drive a specialized type of vehicle
 
00:13:24.629 --> 00:13:24.639 align:start position:0%
um we have similar ones in the CDL um
 
00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
licensing capacity as well where you
 
00:13:29.069 --> 00:13:29.079 align:start position:0%
could have a passenger endorsement to
 
00:13:31.829 --> 00:13:31.839 align:start position:0%
drive a motor coach or School Bus
 
00:13:33.189 --> 00:13:33.199 align:start position:0%
endorsement so again there's a
 
00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:35.320 align:start position:0%
recognition that there are special types
 
00:13:37.389 --> 00:13:37.399 align:start position:0%
of vehicles that you need additional
 
00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:40.120 align:start position:0%
training or an endorsement to be able to
 
00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:41.430 align:start position:0%
training or an endorsement to be able to
drive

00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:41.440 align:start position:0%
drive
 
00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
those okay thank you very much thank
 
00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:47.680 align:start position:0%
you the
 
00:13:51.949 --> 00:13:51.959 align:start position:0%
questions see good thank you thank you
 
00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:55.480 align:start position:0%
um we'll try one one more time with uh
 
00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:57.189 align:start position:0%
um we'll try one one more time with uh
William

William
 
00:14:01.949 --> 00:14:01.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:04.829 --> 00:14:04.839 align:start position:0%
list so with that that's the last person
 
00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:08.800 align:start position:0%
I have uh to testify sign up in advance
 
00:14:11.629 --> 00:14:11.639 align:start position:0%

00:14:13.749 --> 00:14:13.759 align:start position:0%

00:24:06.510 --> 00:24:06.520 align:start position:0%
moment for the members of the committee
 
00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
um this bill last year was introduced as
 
00:24:11.470 --> 00:24:11.480 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill
 
00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:14.760 align:start position:0%
738 and this committee the transport the
 
00:24:17.310 --> 00:24:17.320 align:start position:0%
house Transportation committee spent
 
00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:20.720 align:start position:0%
quite a few quite a long time trying to
 
00:24:24.789 --> 00:24:24.799 align:start position:0%
um work on their original Bill uh
 
00:24:26.909 --> 00:24:26.919 align:start position:0%
working with the stakeholders working
 
00:24:30.510 --> 00:24:30.520 align:start position:0%
with the uh State Superior Court and so
 
00:24:32.830 --> 00:24:32.840 align:start position:0%
on and at the end of the day we came up
 
00:24:38.789 --> 00:24:38.799 align:start position:0%
with a um a bill which we am the amended
 
00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:40.720 align:start position:0%
version went to the house and was and
 
00:24:43.230 --> 00:24:43.240 align:start position:0%
was passed but it was lost in the
 
00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
shuffle of covid last last year
 
00:24:50.430 --> 00:24:50.440 align:start position:0%
um this
 
00:24:53.549 --> 00:24:53.559 align:start position:0%
bill has some Provisions that I feel are
 
00:24:55.149 --> 00:24:55.159 align:start position:0%
particularly important as do the
 
00:24:57.830 --> 00:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
supporters so to begin with the bill is
 
00:25:00.269 --> 00:25:00.279 align:start position:0%
is remove specific language to moral
 
00:25:03.909 --> 00:25:03.919 align:start position:0%
impairment and turpitude when deeming a
 
00:25:06.510 --> 00:25:06.520 align:start position:0%
person as incompetent to drive so that's
 
00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
a really important point it also
 
00:25:12.029 --> 00:25:12.039 align:start position:0%
clarifies license suspension in relation
 
00:25:14.710 --> 00:25:14.720 align:start position:0%
to defaults and it limits those
 
00:25:16.389 --> 00:25:16.399 align:start position:0%
suspensions and defaults for motor
 
00:25:16.399 --> 00:25:17.830 align:start position:0%
suspensions and defaults for motor
vehicle

00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
vehicle
 
00:25:20.430 --> 00:25:20.440 align:start position:0%
offenses only unless otherwise allowed
 
00:25:23.230 --> 00:25:23.240 align:start position:0%
under law so as an example of that um in
 
00:25:25.549 --> 00:25:25.559 align:start position:0%
federal law if you don't pay your child
 
00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:28.240 align:start position:0%
support you can lose your drivers like
 
00:25:31.590 --> 00:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
that that is not changed by this
 
00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:36.880 align:start position:0%
bill um it also um would eliminate any
 
00:25:38.789 --> 00:25:38.799 align:start position:0%
driver license suspensions for a person
 
00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:40.840 align:start position:0%
who defaults on a court appearance or
 
00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:44.520 align:start position:0%
conviction or failure to pay a fine for
 
00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:46.760 align:start position:0%
all other offenses that are not motor
 
00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
vehicle related so one of the thing
 
00:25:50.350 --> 00:25:50.360 align:start position:0%
Prime purposes of this bill is to make
 
00:25:53.789 --> 00:25:53.799 align:start position:0%
that Nexus between uh suspension of your
 
00:25:56.070 --> 00:25:56.080 align:start position:0%
driver's license and motor vehicle
 
00:25:59.710 --> 00:25:59.720 align:start position:0%
related offenses it also um so it does
 
00:26:02.110 --> 00:26:02.120 align:start position:0%
in fact clarify suspension for unpaid
 
00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:04.200 align:start position:0%
child support that's applicable under
 
00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:09.720 align:start position:0%
RSA 263 56 col 56 it also eliminates the
 
00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
authority to report names of persons
 
00:26:14.389 --> 00:26:14.399 align:start position:0%
whose driver's license privileges are
 
00:26:17.430 --> 00:26:17.440 align:start position:0%
suspended because of non-payment to a
 
00:26:19.549 --> 00:26:19.559 align:start position:0%
consumer reporting
 
00:26:22.549 --> 00:26:22.559 align:start position:0%
agency um one of the conflicts that we
 
00:26:26.630 --> 00:26:26.640 align:start position:0%
see from existing uh rsas is that if you
 
00:26:28.830 --> 00:26:28.840 align:start position:0%
don't pay a bill that reported under the
 
00:26:32.110 --> 00:26:32.120 align:start position:0%
consumer uh reporting agency it may be
 
00:26:33.870 --> 00:26:33.880 align:start position:0%
because you don't have enough money
 
00:26:35.870 --> 00:26:35.880 align:start position:0%
obviously and yet if you lose your
 
00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:37.480 align:start position:0%
driver's license your ability to
 
00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:39.760 align:start position:0%
continue to work and ultimately pay
 
00:26:43.909 --> 00:26:43.919 align:start position:0%
those those bills is a real problem and
 
00:26:46.269 --> 00:26:46.279 align:start position:0%
finally it establishes a study committee
 
00:26:49.430 --> 00:26:49.440 align:start position:0%
as opposed to instituting a a driver's
 
00:26:54.389 --> 00:26:54.399 align:start position:0%
license for uh persons who are uh
 
00:26:56.750 --> 00:26:56.760 align:start position:0%
involved in the drug court so for all
 
00:26:58.830 --> 00:26:58.840 align:start position:0%
those reasons and many more I would urge
 
00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:02.760 align:start position:0%
the committee to support this Bill thank
 
00:27:10.510 --> 00:27:10.520 align:start position:0%

hear me can thank you um I'm calling in
 
00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:25.480 align:start position:0%
today in support of this bill on behalf
 
00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:26.760 align:start position:0%
of the New Hampshire Association of
 
00:28:29.950 --> 00:28:29.960 align:start position:0%
criminal defense lawyers um I don't
 
00:28:31.230 --> 00:28:31.240 align:start position:0%
appear very often in front of your
 
00:28:32.789 --> 00:28:32.799 align:start position:0%
committee and I would like to briefly
 
00:28:35.470 --> 00:28:35.480 align:start position:0%
just explain that we represent U more
 
00:28:38.710 --> 00:28:38.720 align:start position:0%
than 250 New Hampshire attorneys who
 
00:28:40.509 --> 00:28:40.519 align:start position:0%
include the practice of criminal defense
 
00:28:42.990 --> 00:28:43.000 align:start position:0%
as at least part of their work um we're
 
00:28:44.870 --> 00:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
also a little unique as a professional
 
00:28:46.549 --> 00:28:46.559 align:start position:0%
association in that we don't really
 
00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:48.840 align:start position:0%
advocate for our members we advoc
 
00:28:51.870 --> 00:28:51.880 align:start position:0%
Advocate on behalf of the public so even
 
00:28:54.110 --> 00:28:54.120 align:start position:0%
if something's kind of bad for business
 
00:28:55.830 --> 00:28:55.840 align:start position:0%
um if it's good for the citizens of the
 
00:28:58.110 --> 00:28:58.120 align:start position:0%
state we'll support it and that's part
 
00:29:00.830 --> 00:29:00.840 align:start position:0%
of the reason that we support this bill
 
00:29:03.430 --> 00:29:03.440 align:start position:0%
um I think that this bill will correct
 
00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:06.240 align:start position:0%
some significant flaws in in using the
 
00:29:09.630 --> 00:29:09.640 align:start position:0%
the system of licensed suspensions um to
 
00:29:11.830 --> 00:29:11.840 align:start position:0%
keep people trapped in a cycle of
 
00:29:14.470 --> 00:29:14.480 align:start position:0%
poverty um because of the nature of our
 
00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:16.240 align:start position:0%
state it's so important for people to be
 
00:29:20.230 --> 00:29:20.240 align:start position:0%
able to drive and um it makes sense to
 
00:29:22.350 --> 00:29:22.360 align:start position:0%
suspend licenses when there's a
 
00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:25.120 align:start position:0%
dangerous driving um you know when
 
00:29:26.750 --> 00:29:26.760 align:start position:0%
people are engaging in dangerous driving
 
00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:28.320 align:start position:0%
or have become fit to drive but it
 
00:29:31.070 --> 00:29:31.080 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be used um as a tool to try
 
00:29:33.909 --> 00:29:33.919 align:start position:0%
and control people and other kinds of
 
00:29:35.830 --> 00:29:35.840 align:start position:0%
behaviors that are not actually directly
 
00:29:38.909 --> 00:29:38.919 align:start position:0%
related to driving so we absolutely
 
00:29:42.630 --> 00:29:42.640 align:start position:0%
support that um I do have one request in
 
00:29:44.110 --> 00:29:44.120 align:start position:0%
the second provision that deals with
 
00:29:46.549 --> 00:29:46.559 align:start position:0%
drug court and that would simply be that
 
00:29:50.149 --> 00:29:50.159 align:start position:0%
um a seat be added for the New Hampshire
 
00:29:52.389 --> 00:29:52.399 align:start position:0%
Association of criminal defense lawyers
 
00:29:54.350 --> 00:29:54.360 align:start position:0%
um there is a seat there for public
 
00:29:57.509 --> 00:29:57.519 align:start position:0%
defenders but I will say that our
 
00:30:00.909 --> 00:30:00.919 align:start position:0%
membership includes representation of a
 
00:30:04.950 --> 00:30:04.960 align:start position:0%
much broader scope of the
 
00:30:08.590 --> 00:30:08.600 align:start position:0%
citizenry and um I think that that the
 
00:30:12.549 --> 00:30:12.559 align:start position:0%
drug courts um and also driving in
 
00:30:15.710 --> 00:30:15.720 align:start position:0%
general um it would be beneficial to
 
00:30:18.269 --> 00:30:18.279 align:start position:0%
have one of our experts who works in the
 
00:30:21.590 --> 00:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
drug courts and also works um on driving
 
00:30:24.710 --> 00:30:24.720 align:start position:0%
laws for usually decades um to be able
 
00:30:26.789 --> 00:30:26.799 align:start position:0%
to offer their expertise as well so we
 
00:30:28.549 --> 00:30:28.559 align:start position:0%
would just request that we be added to
 
00:30:30.950 --> 00:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
that and I I have to admit I completely
 
00:30:32.590 --> 00:30:32.600 align:start position:0%
missed this bill last year I would have
 
00:30:36.549 --> 00:30:36.559 align:start position:0%
asked sooner um but uh given the chance
 
00:30:39.630 --> 00:30:39.640 align:start position:0%
now I'll just make the the request today
 
00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
so thank you very
 
00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
much okay thank you any questions from
 
00:30:46.830 --> 00:30:46.840 align:start position:0%

1667 um that's the bill that uh the
 
00:32:09.149 --> 00:32:09.159 align:start position:0%
committee work and and eventually it was
 
00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:11.840 align:start position:0%
passed with uh I believe a unanimous
 
00:32:15.710 --> 00:32:15.720 align:start position:0%
vote of the committee um and uh got lost
 
00:32:20.350 --> 00:32:20.360 align:start position:0%
in the co uh mess um I'm gonna I I'll
 
00:32:22.230 --> 00:32:22.240 align:start position:0%
I'll try and be really brief uh I know
 
00:32:24.430 --> 00:32:24.440 align:start position:0%
the committee's got business to do I
 
00:32:26.789 --> 00:32:26.799 align:start position:0%
think you know at the core of this bill
 
00:32:31.230 --> 00:32:31.240 align:start position:0%
are is two things one uh put aside those
 
00:32:33.269 --> 00:32:33.279 align:start position:0%
who have engaged in motor vehicle
 
00:32:36.710 --> 00:32:36.720 align:start position:0%
offenses and who Merit uh uh perhaps
 
00:32:39.269 --> 00:32:39.279 align:start position:0%
Merit a removal of their suspension of
 
00:32:40.909 --> 00:32:40.919 align:start position:0%
their license while those charges are
 
00:32:43.830 --> 00:32:43.840 align:start position:0%
pending for everybody else it just is
 
00:32:46.509 --> 00:32:46.519 align:start position:0%
not common sense to if we want to
 
00:32:49.350 --> 00:32:49.360 align:start position:0%
encourage people to pay Their fines and
 
00:32:52.350 --> 00:32:52.360 align:start position:0%
to uh show up for court to take away
 
00:32:54.389 --> 00:32:54.399 align:start position:0%
their driver's license making it harder
 
00:32:56.269 --> 00:32:56.279 align:start position:0%
for them to go to work so they can pay
 
00:32:58.190 --> 00:32:58.200 align:start position:0%
Their fines and making it harder for
 
00:32:59.870 --> 00:32:59.880 align:start position:0%
them to go to court because they don't
 
00:33:01.870 --> 00:33:01.880 align:start position:0%
have a license it's the kind of
 
00:33:05.269 --> 00:33:05.279 align:start position:0%
imposition imposition on their ability
 
00:33:07.950 --> 00:33:07.960 align:start position:0%
to do what we want them to do that is
 
00:33:10.830 --> 00:33:10.840 align:start position:0%
inconsistent with uh moving things
 
00:33:13.029 --> 00:33:13.039 align:start position:0%
forward in a positive way I mean that's
 
00:33:16.350 --> 00:33:16.360 align:start position:0%
the essence of this bill uh you you want
 
00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:18.240 align:start position:0%
people to show to court so you're not
 
00:33:19.389 --> 00:33:19.399 align:start position:0%
going to take away their driver's
 
00:33:21.070 --> 00:33:21.080 align:start position:0%
license you want people to pay Their
 
00:33:22.789 --> 00:33:22.799 align:start position:0%
fines so you're not going to make it
 
00:33:26.669 --> 00:33:26.679 align:start position:0%
harder for them to uh uh to go to work
 
00:33:29.430 --> 00:33:29.440 align:start position:0%
uh that's the essence of this bill um
 
00:33:32.909 --> 00:33:32.919 align:start position:0%
and uh others uh have talked or uh
 
00:33:34.350 --> 00:33:34.360 align:start position:0%
representative syes has already talked
 
00:33:37.830 --> 00:33:37.840 align:start position:0%
about some of the details um the last
 
00:33:40.430 --> 00:33:40.440 align:start position:0%
the the uh drug court uh the special
 
00:33:42.629 --> 00:33:42.639 align:start position:0%
what we call the uh special driving
 
00:33:45.389 --> 00:33:45.399 align:start position:0%
privileges for drug court study
 
00:33:47.990 --> 00:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
commission know I've talked to a number
 
00:33:49.549 --> 00:33:49.559 align:start position:0%
of Superior Court judges who are in
 
00:33:51.870 --> 00:33:51.880 align:start position:0%
charge of drug courts around the state
 
00:33:57.470 --> 00:33:57.480 align:start position:0%
uh and they all would like to facilitate
 
00:33:59.909 --> 00:33:59.919 align:start position:0%
the the people who are actively
 
00:34:03.909 --> 00:34:03.919 align:start position:0%
participating in drug court facilitate
 
00:34:07.110 --> 00:34:07.120 align:start position:0%
their engaging in the kind of conduct
 
00:34:10.190 --> 00:34:10.200 align:start position:0%
that helps them in their recovery that
 
00:34:13.629 --> 00:34:13.639 align:start position:0%
is showing up for appointments medical
 
00:34:15.790 --> 00:34:15.800 align:start position:0%
therapeutic appointments showing up for
 
00:34:18.669 --> 00:34:18.679 align:start position:0%
their job showing up for drug court it's
 
00:34:21.069 --> 00:34:21.079 align:start position:0%
particularly important in rural counties
 
00:34:24.389 --> 00:34:24.399 align:start position:0%
like chesher and the northern counties
 
00:34:26.990 --> 00:34:27.000 align:start position:0%
drug courts have been very successful
 
00:34:29.710 --> 00:34:29.720 align:start position:0%
but it it it it's really an imposition
 
00:34:32.669 --> 00:34:32.679 align:start position:0%
for individuals who are working hard and
 
00:34:34.750 --> 00:34:34.760 align:start position:0%
actively and positively involved in drug
 
00:34:39.310 --> 00:34:39.320 align:start position:0%
court uh to uh to do the kinds of things
 
00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
that everybody wants them to do when
 
00:34:45.550 --> 00:34:45.560 align:start position:0%
they don't have a license um so uh we we
 
00:34:47.589 --> 00:34:47.599 align:start position:0%
all the stakeholders recognize that
 
00:34:50.909 --> 00:34:50.919 align:start position:0%
crafting an appropriate license for
 
00:34:54.790 --> 00:34:54.800 align:start position:0%
these people is a complicated matter uh
 
00:34:57.470 --> 00:34:57.480 align:start position:0%
involving any number of stakeholders
 
00:34:59.630 --> 00:34:59.640 align:start position:0%
therein lies the study committee rather
 
00:35:02.390 --> 00:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
than trying to craft in legislation the
 
00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
the the the uh bounds of that kind of
 
00:35:07.390 --> 00:35:07.400 align:start position:0%
license uh with that uh more than
 
00:35:09.390 --> 00:35:09.400 align:start position:0%
willing to entertain any
 
00:35:12.230 --> 00:35:12.240 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much I do see
 
00:35:14.310 --> 00:35:14.320 align:start position:0%
one question representative Aaron thank
 
00:35:17.790 --> 00:35:17.800 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you Mr sherff for
 
00:35:20.870 --> 00:35:20.880 align:start position:0%
uh coming to testify today I'm wondering
 
00:35:25.589 --> 00:35:25.599 align:start position:0%
if you know uh of any statistics which
 
00:35:30.510 --> 00:35:30.520 align:start position:0%
show um the percentage of license
 
00:35:35.150 --> 00:35:35.160 align:start position:0%
suspensions happening because of driver
 
00:35:38.710 --> 00:35:38.720 align:start position:0%
infections versus any other
 
00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:40.670 align:start position:0%
infections versus any other
issues

00:35:40.670 --> 00:35:40.680 align:start position:0%
issues
 
00:35:43.069 --> 00:35:43.079 align:start position:0%
where I appreciate your question thank
 
00:35:46.030 --> 00:35:46.040 align:start position:0%
you it's a good question um I last year
 
00:35:47.829 --> 00:35:47.839 align:start position:0%
I tried to figure that out I tried to
 
00:35:49.270 --> 00:35:49.280 align:start position:0%
reach out I reached out to the court
 
00:35:51.950 --> 00:35:51.960 align:start position:0%
system they don't keep those kind of
 
00:35:54.950 --> 00:35:54.960 align:start position:0%
Statistics uh and uh we tried to see if
 
00:35:56.510 --> 00:35:56.520 align:start position:0%
we could get those kind of Statistics
 
00:35:59.710 --> 00:35:59.720 align:start position:0%
from uh motor vehicles and that uh was
 
00:36:02.670 --> 00:36:02.680 align:start position:0%
not it turned out not to be possible
 
00:36:06.470 --> 00:36:06.480 align:start position:0%
from my years of practice and my uh you
 
00:36:09.430 --> 00:36:09.440 align:start position:0%
know anecdotal conver conversations with
 
00:36:13.309 --> 00:36:13.319 align:start position:0%
people uh in the system uh clerks and
 
00:36:15.430 --> 00:36:15.440 align:start position:0%
judges uh particularly Circuit Court
 
00:36:18.670 --> 00:36:18.680 align:start position:0%
judges my pretty strong sense is that
 
00:36:22.030 --> 00:36:22.040 align:start position:0%
the huge majority of fines that aren't
 
00:36:26.030 --> 00:36:26.040 align:start position:0%
paid are for motor V relatively minor
 
00:36:28.069 --> 00:36:28.079 align:start position:0%
Motor Vehicles
 
00:36:32.550 --> 00:36:32.560 align:start position:0%
offenses um which are not excluded from
 
00:36:35.270 --> 00:36:35.280 align:start position:0%
uh this uh Bill those those are still in
 
00:36:38.309 --> 00:36:38.319 align:start position:0%
place so I guess uh another way to put
 
00:36:40.630 --> 00:36:40.640 align:start position:0%
it is uh I don't think there's going to
 
00:36:44.510 --> 00:36:44.520 align:start position:0%
be a a major Revenue reduction by virtue
 
00:36:48.069 --> 00:36:48.079 align:start position:0%
of this passing because those people who
 
00:36:49.990 --> 00:36:50.000 align:start position:0%
are you know out ofers who are not
 
00:36:52.670 --> 00:36:52.680 align:start position:0%
paying their speeding tickets just as an
 
00:36:57.190 --> 00:36:57.200 align:start position:0%
example you um uh they don't they don't
 
00:36:59.230 --> 00:36:59.240 align:start position:0%
they don't they they are Exempted from
 
00:37:01.390 --> 00:37:01.400 align:start position:0%
not having their license suspended their
 
00:37:03.309 --> 00:37:03.319 align:start position:0%
license if they don't pay their speeding
 
00:37:05.710 --> 00:37:05.720 align:start position:0%
ticket will be suspended and more
 
00:37:08.309 --> 00:37:08.319 align:start position:0%
importantly for for the court system the
 
00:37:10.069 --> 00:37:10.079 align:start position:0%
court system will be able to threaten
 
00:37:11.829 --> 00:37:11.839 align:start position:0%
them which is the most effective thing
 
00:37:14.069 --> 00:37:14.079 align:start position:0%
with these motor vehicle scoff laws the
 
00:37:15.470 --> 00:37:15.480 align:start position:0%
court system will still be able to
 
00:37:17.510 --> 00:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
threaten them with the loss of license
 
00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
if they don't pay their fine and so
 
00:37:22.190 --> 00:37:22.200 align:start position:0%
that's still in place so again I can't
 
00:37:24.510 --> 00:37:24.520 align:start position:0%
give you uh statistics I don't know if
 
00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:27.760 align:start position:0%
they're obtainable given the uh court
 
00:37:29.990 --> 00:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
system doesn't uh is not a data
 
00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:32.640 align:start position:0%
collection system it's a uh it's a case
 
00:37:35.150 --> 00:37:35.160 align:start position:0%
management system uh but I'm pretty
 
00:37:37.069 --> 00:37:37.079 align:start position:0%
confident saying that the huge majority
 
00:37:40.030 --> 00:37:40.040 align:start position:0%
of uh unpaid fines are in uh motor
 
00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
vehicle offenses if that I hope that's
 
00:37:43.069 --> 00:37:43.079 align:start position:0%
helpful to you
 
00:37:45.790 --> 00:37:45.800 align:start position:0%
representative okay thank you for your
 
00:37:49.190 --> 00:37:49.200 align:start position:0%

00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:15.520 align:start position:0%
minutes thank you Mr chair and members
 
00:38:17.390 --> 00:38:17.400 align:start position:0%
of the committee good morning my name is
 
00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:19.040 align:start position:0%
Jeanie hesa and I'm the political
 
00:38:20.270 --> 00:38:20.280 align:start position:0%
director for the American civil
 
00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:22.480 align:start position:0%
liberties Union of New Hampshire I
 
00:38:24.069 --> 00:38:24.079 align:start position:0%
really appreciate the opportunity to
 
00:38:27.150 --> 00:38:27.160 align:start position:0%
testify today on HB 435
 
00:38:29.230 --> 00:38:29.240 align:start position:0%
uh like the previous witness we strongly
 
00:38:31.349 --> 00:38:31.359 align:start position:0%
supported this bill last year and were a
 
00:38:34.550 --> 00:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
part of the really intensive committee
 
00:38:36.910 --> 00:38:36.920 align:start position:0%
deliberations that happened about it um
 
00:38:38.430 --> 00:38:38.440 align:start position:0%
and we're really happy with the bill
 
00:38:40.950 --> 00:38:40.960 align:start position:0%
that the committee ended up producing um
 
00:38:42.950 --> 00:38:42.960 align:start position:0%
and it as has been noted it passed the
 
00:38:45.390 --> 00:38:45.400 align:start position:0%
committee on 20 to zero it passed the
 
00:38:47.710 --> 00:38:47.720 align:start position:0%
house on Voice vote uh and we think it
 
00:38:49.870 --> 00:38:49.880 align:start position:0%
would have actually repeatedly passed
 
00:38:53.430 --> 00:38:53.440 align:start position:0%
the house on Voice vote but for covid um
 
00:38:55.750 --> 00:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
I do want to note this bill is actually
 
00:38:58.069 --> 00:38:58.079 align:start position:0%
a continuation of this legislature is
 
00:38:59.630 --> 00:38:59.640 align:start position:0%
really great
 
00:39:02.230 --> 00:39:02.240 align:start position:0%
bipartisan work over the past few years
 
00:39:05.390 --> 00:39:05.400 align:start position:0%
to end debtor's prison to to create a
 
00:39:07.870 --> 00:39:07.880 align:start position:0%
justice system that is no longer two
 
00:39:11.990 --> 00:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
tiered based on income so often um in
 
00:39:14.150 --> 00:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
past years your experience in the
 
00:39:16.790 --> 00:39:16.800 align:start position:0%
justice system depended on your income
 
00:39:19.349 --> 00:39:19.359 align:start position:0%
if you were wealthy you could afford to
 
00:39:21.829 --> 00:39:21.839 align:start position:0%
get out of jail you could afford fines
 
00:39:23.309 --> 00:39:23.319 align:start position:0%
you could afford to do all sorts of
 
00:39:25.630 --> 00:39:25.640 align:start position:0%
things and if you were lowincome you got
 
00:39:28.550 --> 00:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
hit with penalties and fines and fees
 
00:39:31.790 --> 00:39:31.800 align:start position:0%
and you ended up uh in jail pre-trial so
 
00:39:34.470 --> 00:39:34.480 align:start position:0%
this legislature passed uh legislation
 
00:39:36.470 --> 00:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
related to debtor's prison to make sure
 
00:39:38.710 --> 00:39:38.720 align:start position:0%
that people could not go to jail for a
 
00:39:42.270 --> 00:39:42.280 align:start position:0%
failure to pay a fine um in 2019 the
 
00:39:44.150 --> 00:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
legislature enacted legislation to
 
00:39:45.790 --> 00:39:45.800 align:start position:0%
prevent the government from charging
 
00:39:47.589 --> 00:39:47.599 align:start position:0%
people for the cost of their
 
00:39:49.750 --> 00:39:49.760 align:start position:0%
incarceration um we've made some really
 
00:39:51.790 --> 00:39:51.800 align:start position:0%
great reforms and we see this
 
00:39:54.470 --> 00:39:54.480 align:start position:0%
legislation as a continuation of that
 
00:39:56.550 --> 00:39:56.560 align:start position:0%
the the purpose of this bill to make
 
00:39:59.190 --> 00:39:59.200 align:start position:0%
sure that people do not suffer because
 
00:40:03.190 --> 00:40:03.200 align:start position:0%
of their income um this New Hampshire is
 
00:40:05.349 --> 00:40:05.359 align:start position:0%
a rural State there's a you know we
 
00:40:06.630 --> 00:40:06.640 align:start position:0%
always joke in New Hampshire that
 
00:40:08.870 --> 00:40:08.880 align:start position:0%
everything is an hour away that's an
 
00:40:12.150 --> 00:40:12.160 align:start position:0%
hour of driving if you can't drive in
 
00:40:14.829 --> 00:40:14.839 align:start position:0%
this state you you probably can't get to
 
00:40:17.109 --> 00:40:17.119 align:start position:0%
work it's going to be it's it's
 
00:40:18.710 --> 00:40:18.720 align:start position:0%
difficult to go to the grocery store
 
00:40:19.950 --> 00:40:19.960 align:start position:0%
right now you probably can't get
 
00:40:22.950 --> 00:40:22.960 align:start position:0%
vaccinated if you're not able to drive
 
00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:24.720 align:start position:0%
um and when you suspend a
 
00:40:27.950 --> 00:40:27.960 align:start position:0%
license the the real harsh reality is
 
00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:30.720 align:start position:0%
that people typically Drive anyway
 
00:40:33.589 --> 00:40:33.599 align:start position:0%
because they have to again they have to
 
00:40:35.390 --> 00:40:35.400 align:start position:0%
get to work if you want them to pay off
 
00:40:38.150 --> 00:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
the fine they need a source of income if
 
00:40:40.109 --> 00:40:40.119 align:start position:0%
they want to feed their family they have
 
00:40:41.990 --> 00:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
to be able to drive to the grocery store
 
00:40:44.670 --> 00:40:44.680 align:start position:0%
and so when you suspend a license what
 
00:40:46.750 --> 00:40:46.760 align:start position:0%
happens is people end up driving on a
 
00:40:48.790 --> 00:40:48.800 align:start position:0%
suspended license which actually then
 
00:40:51.750 --> 00:40:51.760 align:start position:0%
risks them getting arrested for driving
 
00:40:54.109 --> 00:40:54.119 align:start position:0%
on a suspended license and they actually
 
00:40:56.990 --> 00:40:57.000 align:start position:0%
could face incarceration for that and so
 
00:40:59.309 --> 00:40:59.319 align:start position:0%
often when you suspend a license you're
 
00:41:01.030 --> 00:41:01.040 align:start position:0%
kind of sending somebody into this
 
00:41:04.750 --> 00:41:04.760 align:start position:0%
downward spiral um of fines and fees and
 
00:41:06.750 --> 00:41:06.760 align:start position:0%
again it could result in
 
00:41:08.910 --> 00:41:08.920 align:start position:0%
incarceration and so we're really trying
 
00:41:11.829 --> 00:41:11.839 align:start position:0%
to create a system where it doesn't have
 
00:41:14.589 --> 00:41:14.599 align:start position:0%
these really harsh collateral
 
00:41:16.670 --> 00:41:16.680 align:start position:0%
consequences for people who are
 
00:41:19.349 --> 00:41:19.359 align:start position:0%
lowincome and may struggle to pay a fine
 
00:41:23.349 --> 00:41:23.359 align:start position:0%
or a fee and and so we really commend
 
00:41:24.910 --> 00:41:24.920 align:start position:0%
this committee again for all its work
 
00:41:27.710 --> 00:41:27.720 align:start position:0%
that put into this bill last year um and
 
00:41:29.910 --> 00:41:29.920 align:start position:0%
and we hope to see it finally advaned to
 
00:41:32.470 --> 00:41:32.480 align:start position:0%
the Senate this session and I'm happy to
 
00:41:34.430 --> 00:41:34.440 align:start position:0%
answer any
 
00:41:38.829 --> 00:41:38.839 align:start position:0%
questions very much representative
 
00:41:42.190 --> 00:41:42.200 align:start position:0%
pataro thank you Mr chair and um thank
 
00:41:44.870 --> 00:41:44.880 align:start position:0%
you uh Miss rasa for uh coming here to
 
00:41:48.750 --> 00:41:48.760 align:start position:0%
testify my question is um if the court
 
00:41:52.270 --> 00:41:52.280 align:start position:0%
imposes a fine and if
 
00:41:56.630 --> 00:41:56.640 align:start position:0%
um if the uh the defendant of a better
 
00:41:59.630 --> 00:41:59.640 align:start position:0%
term they can prove um that they have
 
00:42:01.870 --> 00:42:01.880 align:start position:0%
difficulties paying or whatnot can they
 
00:42:03.870 --> 00:42:03.880 align:start position:0%
work with the court to for example set
 
00:42:06.109 --> 00:42:06.119 align:start position:0%
up some sort of payment
 
00:42:09.790 --> 00:42:09.800 align:start position:0%
plan I I believe in theory they can um
 
00:42:11.349 --> 00:42:11.359 align:start position:0%
and I think that's a good question and
 
00:42:14.230 --> 00:42:14.240 align:start position:0%
and it actually gets to something else
 
00:42:16.190 --> 00:42:16.200 align:start position:0%
which we talked about at length last
 
00:42:18.430 --> 00:42:18.440 align:start position:0%
year right which is the reality is like
 
00:42:20.950 --> 00:42:20.960 align:start position:0%
suspending sentences can't may be
 
00:42:23.190 --> 00:42:23.200 align:start position:0%
effective um because it's an infliction
 
00:42:25.910 --> 00:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
of pain right you are inflicting pain on
 
00:42:27.630 --> 00:42:27.640 align:start position:0%
some somebody you're inflicting hardship
 
00:42:30.150 --> 00:42:30.160 align:start position:0%
on somebody uh and the struggle that we
 
00:42:32.030 --> 00:42:32.040 align:start position:0%
would say is you know there are some
 
00:42:34.270 --> 00:42:34.280 align:start position:0%
really effective policies out there if
 
00:42:37.630 --> 00:42:37.640 align:start position:0%
you wanted to force Somebody To You know
 
00:42:38.750 --> 00:42:38.760 align:start position:0%
spend the money that they would
 
00:42:40.750 --> 00:42:40.760 align:start position:0%
otherwise spend on rent paying off fines
 
00:42:42.349 --> 00:42:42.359 align:start position:0%
and fees you can threaten them with
 
00:42:44.270 --> 00:42:44.280 align:start position:0%
house arrest you could threaten all
 
00:42:46.069 --> 00:42:46.079 align:start position:0%
sorts of things that would probably be
 
00:42:48.670 --> 00:42:48.680 align:start position:0%
effective but it doesn't make for good
 
00:42:51.430 --> 00:42:51.440 align:start position:0%
policy and that's our argument here is
 
00:42:54.109 --> 00:42:54.119 align:start position:0%
you know suspending a license might be
 
00:42:56.309 --> 00:42:56.319 align:start position:0%
effective in certain circumstances but
 
00:43:00.349 --> 00:43:00.359 align:start position:0%
it's a really harsh penalty that can
 
00:43:02.390 --> 00:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
affect somebody's ability to take care
 
00:43:04.510 --> 00:43:04.520 align:start position:0%
of their family to pay rent to do all
 
00:43:08.230 --> 00:43:08.240 align:start position:0%
sorts of other things um so I know I'm
 
00:43:10.670 --> 00:43:10.680 align:start position:0%
going off a going off a little bit from
 
00:43:13.630 --> 00:43:13.640 align:start position:0%
your question um but yes I I do think
 
00:43:15.549 --> 00:43:15.559 align:start position:0%
there are ways to work with the courts
 
00:43:17.790 --> 00:43:17.800 align:start position:0%
however I don't think everybody is
 
00:43:19.670 --> 00:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
necessarily informed of that or able to
 
00:43:21.109 --> 00:43:21.119 align:start position:0%
take advantage of it and there are
 
00:43:22.589 --> 00:43:22.599 align:start position:0%
certain people especially right now
 
00:43:24.109 --> 00:43:24.119 align:start position:0%
we're in we're in the midst of a
 
00:43:26.270 --> 00:43:26.280 align:start position:0%
pandemic when a lot of people have lost
 
00:43:29.510 --> 00:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
job and have no money um and so their
 
00:43:31.510 --> 00:43:31.520 align:start position:0%
ability to pay any kind of fine right
 
00:43:33.710 --> 00:43:33.720 align:start position:0%
now is pretty
 
00:43:38.870 --> 00:43:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:41.710 --> 00:43:41.720 align:start position:0%
youa did you still have a question no
 
00:43:44.829 --> 00:43:44.839 align:start position:0%
okay any further questions from the
 
00:43:46.990 --> 00:43:47.000 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you very
 
00:43:53.870 --> 00:43:53.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:56.990 --> 00:43:57.000 align:start position:0%
you see a few hands up
 
00:44:09.990 --> 00:44:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:12.390 --> 00:44:12.400 align:start position:0%
Cal hi can you all hear
 
00:44:14.549 --> 00:44:14.559 align:start position:0%
me if I can get you to state your name
 
00:44:17.030 --> 00:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
for the record and who you may represent
 
00:44:18.950 --> 00:44:18.960 align:start position:0%
hi uh Alex cassal I work for the
 
00:44:22.230 --> 00:44:22.240 align:start position:0%
judicial branch I am the uh Statewide
 
00:44:25.630 --> 00:44:25.640 align:start position:0%
drug offender program coordinator and uh
 
00:44:26.990 --> 00:44:27.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Mr chairman members of the
 
00:44:30.750 --> 00:44:30.760 align:start position:0%
committee um so I'm here on behalf of uh
 
00:44:32.990 --> 00:44:33.000 align:start position:0%
the drug courts and uh judge Neta who
 
00:44:36.630 --> 00:44:36.640 align:start position:0%
wasn't able to to be here so we
 
00:44:38.790 --> 00:44:38.800 align:start position:0%
understand the the bill and uh we were
 
00:44:41.069 --> 00:44:41.079 align:start position:0%
involved in the in last year before
 
00:44:43.829 --> 00:44:43.839 align:start position:0%
covid hit we we went to the hearings uh
 
00:44:50.710 --> 00:44:50.720 align:start position:0%
on that and so we we feel that the um
 
00:44:52.670 --> 00:44:52.680 align:start position:0%
we're we're really neither like for or
 
00:44:54.589 --> 00:44:54.599 align:start position:0%
against it um you know we we are in
 
00:44:56.109 --> 00:44:56.119 align:start position:0%
favor of a study committee because
 
00:44:57.589 --> 00:44:57.599 align:start position:0%
there's a small handful of states that
 
00:44:59.950 --> 00:44:59.960 align:start position:0%
do have similar legislation like this in
 
00:45:02.309 --> 00:45:02.319 align:start position:0%
place um so we can learn and talk to
 
00:45:04.510 --> 00:45:04.520 align:start position:0%
them uh and find out what's working what
 
00:45:09.069 --> 00:45:09.079 align:start position:0%
doesn't and um I know that driving for
 
00:45:11.109 --> 00:45:11.119 align:start position:0%
uh individuals that are in a treatment
 
00:45:13.549 --> 00:45:13.559 align:start position:0%
court is difficult especially the ones
 
00:45:15.349 --> 00:45:15.359 align:start position:0%
that are coming out of jail or prison
 
00:45:16.470 --> 00:45:16.480 align:start position:0%
they don't have employment they don't
 
00:45:18.790 --> 00:45:18.800 align:start position:0%
have a car they don't have a license uh
 
00:45:20.430 --> 00:45:20.440 align:start position:0%
it might be difficult for them to obtain
 
00:45:22.190 --> 00:45:22.200 align:start position:0%
that um so we're we're definitely open
 
00:45:23.829 --> 00:45:23.839 align:start position:0%
to the idea of a study committee to find
 
00:45:26.150 --> 00:45:26.160 align:start position:0%
out if this is uh something that we
 
00:45:27.630 --> 00:45:27.640 align:start position:0%
should that we should do in New
 
00:45:31.750 --> 00:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and uh my testimony was short
 
00:45:33.309 --> 00:45:33.319 align:start position:0%
but I will answer any questions that you
 
00:45:36.630 --> 00:45:36.640 align:start position:0%
guys may have on uh the drug courts
 
00:45:38.589 --> 00:45:38.599 align:start position:0%
themselves or any kind of difficulties
 
00:45:39.870 --> 00:45:39.880 align:start position:0%
that participants might have while
 
00:45:42.549 --> 00:45:42.559 align:start position:0%
they're in the program thank
 
00:45:46.950 --> 00:45:46.960 align:start position:0%
you questions from the committee
 
00:45:48.990 --> 00:45:49.000 align:start position:0%
repres thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:45:51.150 --> 00:45:51.160 align:start position:0%
for taking my question can you just give
 
00:45:53.710 --> 00:45:53.720 align:start position:0%
me um a little more information when a
 
00:45:56.349 --> 00:45:56.359 align:start position:0%
participant goes into drug court um I
 
00:45:58.670 --> 00:45:58.680 align:start position:0%
assume it's not always a given that they
 
00:46:00.670 --> 00:46:00.680 align:start position:0%
lose their license but would can you
 
00:46:02.430 --> 00:46:02.440 align:start position:0%
give us a little feedback on the
 
00:46:04.349 --> 00:46:04.359 align:start position:0%
participants and their driving
 
00:46:06.630 --> 00:46:06.640 align:start position:0%
privileges when they come through your
 
00:46:08.750 --> 00:46:08.760 align:start position:0%
program sure uh thank you for your
 
00:46:11.990 --> 00:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
question so uh participation in the
 
00:46:14.950 --> 00:46:14.960 align:start position:0%
program doesn't uh doesn't take
 
00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
somebody's ability to drive or give them
 
00:46:19.470 --> 00:46:19.480 align:start position:0%
the ability to drive if they've already
 
00:46:22.109 --> 00:46:22.119 align:start position:0%
lost their license for previous offenses
 
00:46:25.309 --> 00:46:25.319 align:start position:0%
or fines um then then then that's just
 
00:46:27.430 --> 00:46:27.440 align:start position:0%
the case and we try to work with them uh
 
00:46:29.309 --> 00:46:29.319 align:start position:0%
at the beginning stages they they
 
00:46:31.270 --> 00:46:31.280 align:start position:0%
probably have to go to I'd say anywhere
 
00:46:33.910 --> 00:46:33.920 align:start position:0%
from 8 to 10 different appointments on
 
00:46:36.150 --> 00:46:36.160 align:start position:0%
any given week whether it be counseling
 
00:46:39.390 --> 00:46:39.400 align:start position:0%
or Court B management or drug testing so
 
00:46:41.510 --> 00:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
there is a lot of back and forth you
 
00:46:43.710 --> 00:46:43.720 align:start position:0%
know driving around and and you know
 
00:46:45.589 --> 00:46:45.599 align:start position:0%
like like a previous person had said you
 
00:46:46.750 --> 00:46:46.760 align:start position:0%
know everything in New Hampshire is
 
00:46:49.069 --> 00:46:49.079 align:start position:0%
within an hour or two of each other but
 
00:46:50.549 --> 00:46:50.559 align:start position:0%
you do need to drive especially if you
 
00:46:52.309 --> 00:46:52.319 align:start position:0%
live in the Northern country like in
 
00:46:54.950 --> 00:46:54.960 align:start position:0%
Coos County and uh Carroll County and
 
00:46:56.430 --> 00:46:56.440 align:start position:0%
Grafton County where we do have drug
 
00:46:58.549 --> 00:46:58.559 align:start position:0%
courts you know to get from one place to
 
00:47:00.109 --> 00:47:00.119 align:start position:0%
another just if you live in Berlin and
 
00:47:01.829 --> 00:47:01.839 align:start position:0%
you need to get to court you that that's
 
00:47:03.829 --> 00:47:03.839 align:start position:0%
about an hour drive and so if you don't
 
00:47:05.270 --> 00:47:05.280 align:start position:0%
have a license it can be it can be
 
00:47:08.230 --> 00:47:08.240 align:start position:0%
fairly difficult um so we do try to set
 
00:47:10.670 --> 00:47:10.680 align:start position:0%
up other things to to help people out
 
00:47:12.990 --> 00:47:13.000 align:start position:0%
that don't have licenses um but there
 
00:47:15.390 --> 00:47:15.400 align:start position:0%
are a lot of obligations um if they are
 
00:47:18.109 --> 00:47:18.119 align:start position:0%
on Medicaid they can uh get a ride to a
 
00:47:20.069 --> 00:47:20.079 align:start position:0%
medical appointment through their their
 
00:47:23.430 --> 00:47:23.440 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and have that be covered um but
 
00:47:24.870 --> 00:47:24.880 align:start position:0%
if it's a non-medical appointment like
 
00:47:26.470 --> 00:47:26.480 align:start position:0%
Court then they can't
 
00:47:28.710 --> 00:47:28.720 align:start position:0%
um so you know we try to have recovery
 
00:47:31.150 --> 00:47:31.160 align:start position:0%
coaches or maybe case managers be able
 
00:47:32.470 --> 00:47:32.480 align:start position:0%
to give them a ride and that's not
 
00:47:34.710 --> 00:47:34.720 align:start position:0%
always consistent across the state
 
00:47:36.589 --> 00:47:36.599 align:start position:0%
across the board because of availability
 
00:47:39.710 --> 00:47:39.720 align:start position:0%
and Staffing and and things like that so
 
00:47:41.390 --> 00:47:41.400 align:start position:0%
when somebody comes in it's very intense
 
00:47:43.030 --> 00:47:43.040 align:start position:0%
as they move through the program they
 
00:47:44.750 --> 00:47:44.760 align:start position:0%
have less and less obligations with the
 
00:47:46.549 --> 00:47:46.559 align:start position:0%
program and at that point they should be
 
00:47:49.109 --> 00:47:49.119 align:start position:0%
looking towards um you know full
 
00:47:51.750 --> 00:47:51.760 align:start position:0%
fulfilling meaningful employment um you
 
00:47:53.710 --> 00:47:53.720 align:start position:0%
know once they're coming into counseling
 
00:47:55.309 --> 00:47:55.319 align:start position:0%
once or twice a week as opposed to three
 
00:47:58.150 --> 00:47:58.160 align:start position:0%
or four times a week so the program
 
00:48:01.109 --> 00:48:01.119 align:start position:0%
itself can last anywhere from 12 to 18
 
00:48:02.750 --> 00:48:02.760 align:start position:0%
months and longer if there are a couple
 
00:48:05.150 --> 00:48:05.160 align:start position:0%
of relapses uh throughout the way uh
 
00:48:07.190 --> 00:48:07.200 align:start position:0%
that might delay you know program
 
00:48:09.549 --> 00:48:09.559 align:start position:0%
progression so it's it's a lengthy
 
00:48:12.230 --> 00:48:12.240 align:start position:0%
program and there's a lot of
 
00:48:14.670 --> 00:48:14.680 align:start position:0%
obligations thank you very much you're
 
00:48:17.750 --> 00:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
welcome representa thank you Mr chair
 
00:48:20.030 --> 00:48:20.040 align:start position:0%
and thank you Mr Cel for taking my
 
00:48:22.790 --> 00:48:22.800 align:start position:0%
question I'm interested to know for any
 
00:48:25.790 --> 00:48:25.800 align:start position:0%
of the uh programming that you do is any
 
00:48:30.109 --> 00:48:30.119 align:start position:0%
of it available via remote um
 
00:48:32.150 --> 00:48:32.160 align:start position:0%
attendance uh thank you for the question
 
00:48:34.309 --> 00:48:34.319 align:start position:0%
so uh before the pandemic hit there was
 
00:48:36.150 --> 00:48:36.160 align:start position:0%
some remote counseling that was
 
00:48:38.589 --> 00:48:38.599 align:start position:0%
available mainly in the northern C uh
 
00:48:40.069 --> 00:48:40.079 align:start position:0%
country you know Coos and Carrol
 
00:48:42.870 --> 00:48:42.880 align:start position:0%
counties and in Grafton County uh once
 
00:48:45.230 --> 00:48:45.240 align:start position:0%
the pandemic hit all of the courts and
 
00:48:48.069 --> 00:48:48.079 align:start position:0%
programs transitioned over to uh you
 
00:48:50.349 --> 00:48:50.359 align:start position:0%
know tella health and and remote Court
 
00:48:52.870 --> 00:48:52.880 align:start position:0%
hearings as the summer months came up
 
00:48:55.150 --> 00:48:55.160 align:start position:0%
Came Upon Us and the and the pandemic
 
00:48:57.190 --> 00:48:57.200 align:start position:0%
wasn't as as prevalent a lot of the
 
00:48:59.270 --> 00:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
treatment agencies started to reopen you
 
00:49:01.270 --> 00:49:01.280 align:start position:0%
know following CDC guidelines and social
 
00:49:03.270 --> 00:49:03.280 align:start position:0%
distancing if they had the room for it
 
00:49:06.150 --> 00:49:06.160 align:start position:0%
to do inperson treatment the the one or
 
00:49:08.630 --> 00:49:08.640 align:start position:0%
two things that were never U moved away
 
00:49:11.150 --> 00:49:11.160 align:start position:0%
from iners was drug testing um because
 
00:49:12.670 --> 00:49:12.680 align:start position:0%
you know we can can't do a remote drug
 
00:49:14.549 --> 00:49:14.559 align:start position:0%
test and and then also probation parole
 
00:49:16.349 --> 00:49:16.359 align:start position:0%
was still doing home visits uh to make
 
00:49:18.109 --> 00:49:18.119 align:start position:0%
sure that their their house was safe and
 
00:49:19.990 --> 00:49:20.000 align:start position:0%
there wasn't drugs and alcohol and you
 
00:49:22.470 --> 00:49:22.480 align:start position:0%
know people that were um running from
 
00:49:24.470 --> 00:49:24.480 align:start position:0%
the law living in their at their at
 
00:49:28.630 --> 00:49:28.640 align:start position:0%
their house um and so what we found is
 
00:49:30.430 --> 00:49:30.440 align:start position:0%
that especially early on in the program
 
00:49:32.309 --> 00:49:32.319 align:start position:0%
that in-person treatment was really
 
00:49:35.870 --> 00:49:35.880 align:start position:0%
beneficial versus remote treatment once
 
00:49:37.549 --> 00:49:37.559 align:start position:0%
somebody's been sober for a period of
 
00:49:40.030 --> 00:49:40.040 align:start position:0%
time you know having a remote treatment
 
00:49:41.789 --> 00:49:41.799 align:start position:0%
uh seemed to work really well but
 
00:49:42.870 --> 00:49:42.880 align:start position:0%
especially at the very beginning if
 
00:49:44.349 --> 00:49:44.359 align:start position:0%
somebody's still actively using it's
 
00:49:46.069 --> 00:49:46.079 align:start position:0%
really hard to do remote treatment on
 
00:49:48.710 --> 00:49:48.720 align:start position:0%
that person three to four times a week
 
00:49:50.230 --> 00:49:50.240 align:start position:0%
um just just to get them to actually
 
00:49:54.030 --> 00:49:54.040 align:start position:0%
sign in and and participate so we the
 
00:49:56.950 --> 00:49:56.960 align:start position:0%
the treatment agencies um would like to
 
00:49:59.829 --> 00:49:59.839 align:start position:0%
maintain that if if if at all possible
 
00:50:02.390 --> 00:50:02.400 align:start position:0%
they still do have the option of remote
 
00:50:04.109 --> 00:50:04.119 align:start position:0%
Court I know some of our courts are
 
00:50:06.430 --> 00:50:06.440 align:start position:0%
starting to open up and have inperson
 
00:50:08.349 --> 00:50:08.359 align:start position:0%
court hearings with a very small limited
 
00:50:11.549 --> 00:50:11.559 align:start position:0%
number um but they but they're going to
 
00:50:14.069 --> 00:50:14.079 align:start position:0%
reserve the ability for remote Court
 
00:50:16.190 --> 00:50:16.200 align:start position:0%
sessions for certain individuals maybe
 
00:50:17.829 --> 00:50:17.839 align:start position:0%
if they're further along in the program
 
00:50:19.309 --> 00:50:19.319 align:start position:0%
or they're working they don't have to
 
00:50:21.030 --> 00:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
take the day off they can just remote in
 
00:50:22.510 --> 00:50:22.520 align:start position:0%
on their lunch break or something like
 
00:50:24.630 --> 00:50:24.640 align:start position:0%
that so right now I'd say it's more of
 
00:50:26.990 --> 00:50:27.000 align:start position:0%
like a hybrid where there's some remote
 
00:50:29.549 --> 00:50:29.559 align:start position:0%
there's some in person um as opposed to
 
00:50:30.950 --> 00:50:30.960 align:start position:0%
when the pandemic first hit everything
 
00:50:33.750 --> 00:50:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:37.510 --> 00:50:37.520 align:start position:0%
remote thank you you're
 
00:50:40.549 --> 00:50:40.559 align:start position:0%
welcome representative Stevens is that a
 
00:50:43.630 --> 00:50:43.640 align:start position:0%
hand I see raised yes it
 
00:50:47.950 --> 00:50:47.960 align:start position:0%
is um thank you for taking my question
 
00:50:51.990 --> 00:50:52.000 align:start position:0%
uh what questions do you have that could
 
00:50:58.589 --> 00:50:58.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:00.789 --> 00:51:00.799 align:start position:0%
uh the questions that I would have is
 
00:51:04.589 --> 00:51:04.599 align:start position:0%
other states that have a similar type of
 
00:51:06.589 --> 00:51:06.599 align:start position:0%
mechanism in place you know what's
 
00:51:09.589 --> 00:51:09.599 align:start position:0%
working really well what's you know his
 
00:51:12.510 --> 00:51:12.520 align:start position:0%
historically and and what uh was set up
 
00:51:15.270 --> 00:51:15.280 align:start position:0%
that didn't seem to work well um I don't
 
00:51:16.750 --> 00:51:16.760 align:start position:0%
know exactly all the different
 
00:51:19.150 --> 00:51:19.160 align:start position:0%
components of of of what those other
 
00:51:21.589 --> 00:51:21.599 align:start position:0%
states had done um but it would be
 
00:51:23.270 --> 00:51:23.280 align:start position:0%
beneficial I think for me to look at
 
00:51:25.789 --> 00:51:25.799 align:start position:0%
those and see you know is it is it just
 
00:51:28.190 --> 00:51:28.200 align:start position:0%
fines is it fines and fees is it is
 
00:51:31.030 --> 00:51:31.040 align:start position:0%
there a waiting period is there uh any
 
00:51:32.990 --> 00:51:33.000 align:start position:0%
kind of clause if somebody gets their
 
00:51:34.990 --> 00:51:35.000 align:start position:0%
license back but then they but then they
 
00:51:37.069 --> 00:51:37.079 align:start position:0%
relapse and start actively using who
 
00:51:41.150 --> 00:51:41.160 align:start position:0%
makes the decision to give their license
 
00:51:42.829 --> 00:51:42.839 align:start position:0%
back if we know that they're using
 
00:51:45.750 --> 00:51:45.760 align:start position:0%
heroin every day or is that just not a
 
00:51:47.630 --> 00:51:47.640 align:start position:0%
non something that's not in the
 
00:51:49.670 --> 00:51:49.680 align:start position:0%
discussion at all you know if they if
 
00:51:51.190 --> 00:51:51.200 align:start position:0%
they meet their obligations with fines
 
00:51:53.390 --> 00:51:53.400 align:start position:0%
and fees but they lose their license and
 
00:51:55.390 --> 00:51:55.400 align:start position:0%
then that's suspended because of this
 
00:51:58.470 --> 00:51:58.480 align:start position:0%
you know potential mechanism do you not
 
00:52:01.069 --> 00:52:01.079 align:start position:0%
even factor in any kind of potential uh
 
00:52:03.789 --> 00:52:03.799 align:start position:0%
drug use or or alcohol use even though
 
00:52:05.510 --> 00:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
the program might know that they're
 
00:52:08.150 --> 00:52:08.160 align:start position:0%
actively using so those are questions
 
00:52:09.630 --> 00:52:09.640 align:start position:0%
that I don't really know the answer to
 
00:52:11.789 --> 00:52:11.799 align:start position:0%
so I would be looking to you know for
 
00:52:15.190 --> 00:52:15.200 align:start position:0%
the study committee to kind of explore
 
00:52:18.670 --> 00:52:18.680 align:start position:0%
those thank you you're
 
00:52:21.670 --> 00:52:21.680 align:start position:0%
welcome representative thank you Mr
 
00:52:24.309 --> 00:52:24.319 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you Mr casselle for
 
00:52:27.750 --> 00:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
coming in this morning um do you have in
 
00:52:30.150 --> 00:52:30.160 align:start position:0%
terms of the participants of uh the drug
 
00:52:33.990 --> 00:52:34.000 align:start position:0%
Courts are there you have are you are
 
00:52:37.349 --> 00:52:37.359 align:start position:0%
you aware of of their crimes and and why
 
00:52:39.870 --> 00:52:39.880 align:start position:0%
they might be
 
00:52:43.030 --> 00:52:43.040 align:start position:0%
there um yes so everybody that that
 
00:52:45.630 --> 00:52:45.640 align:start position:0%
pleas in has to be vetted through the
 
00:52:48.390 --> 00:52:48.400 align:start position:0%
prosecution office and usually also
 
00:52:50.069 --> 00:52:50.079 align:start position:0%
local police so the prosecutor will
 
00:52:51.430 --> 00:52:51.440 align:start position:0%
check with the local police that
 
00:52:53.549 --> 00:52:53.559 align:start position:0%
arrested them to say do you think that
 
00:52:55.589 --> 00:52:55.599 align:start position:0%
this person is appropriate so we we we
 
00:52:58.510 --> 00:52:58.520 align:start position:0%
try to uh exclude uh people that are
 
00:53:00.309 --> 00:53:00.319 align:start position:0%
just drug entrepreneurs that are just
 
00:53:02.030 --> 00:53:02.040 align:start position:0%
dealing to you know not dealing to
 
00:53:03.349 --> 00:53:03.359 align:start position:0%
support a habit but they're just dealing
 
00:53:05.549 --> 00:53:05.559 align:start position:0%
in mass quantities we want to eliminate
 
00:53:07.150 --> 00:53:07.160 align:start position:0%
those individuals and just take people
 
00:53:10.150 --> 00:53:10.160 align:start position:0%
in that are severely addicted their
 
00:53:12.589 --> 00:53:12.599 align:start position:0%
their crimes may not necessarily be drug
 
00:53:14.230 --> 00:53:14.240 align:start position:0%
you know it might not they not be might
 
00:53:15.910 --> 00:53:15.920 align:start position:0%
not be facing a drug crime when they
 
00:53:18.710 --> 00:53:18.720 align:start position:0%
plea in um but it could be a crime that
 
00:53:21.670 --> 00:53:21.680 align:start position:0%
was fueled from drug or alcohol use so
 
00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
we're familiar with their criminal
 
00:53:25.510 --> 00:53:25.520 align:start position:0%
backgrounds and the the prosecution the
 
00:53:28.030 --> 00:53:28.040 align:start position:0%
county attorney in every County
 
00:53:29.670 --> 00:53:29.680 align:start position:0%
typically has the ultimate veto power I
 
00:53:30.910 --> 00:53:30.920 align:start position:0%
mean they would they would be able to
 
00:53:33.109 --> 00:53:33.119 align:start position:0%
say to the program this person is not
 
00:53:34.710 --> 00:53:34.720 align:start position:0%
appropriate I can't tell you why you
 
00:53:36.430 --> 00:53:36.440 align:start position:0%
know maybe there's an active investig
 
00:53:37.870 --> 00:53:37.880 align:start position:0%
investigation of other things that we
 
00:53:40.230 --> 00:53:40.240 align:start position:0%
don't know about and so therefore the
 
00:53:41.430 --> 00:53:41.440 align:start position:0%
the the County Attorney is really kind
 
00:53:43.349 --> 00:53:43.359 align:start position:0%
of the gatekeeper to most of the
 
00:53:45.670 --> 00:53:45.680 align:start position:0%
participants coming into the
 
00:53:47.630 --> 00:53:47.640 align:start position:0%
programs that covered a lot thank you
 
00:53:51.270 --> 00:53:51.280 align:start position:0%
very much you're welcome any further
 
00:53:54.150 --> 00:53:54.160 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
00:53:59.870 --> 00:53:59.880 align:start position:0%
much thank you chair recognizes
 
00:54:14.230 --> 00:54:14.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:17.470 --> 00:54:17.480 align:start position:0%
raised um good good morning Mr chairman
 
00:54:19.270 --> 00:54:19.280 align:start position:0%
uh members of the committee my name is
 
00:54:20.990 --> 00:54:21.000 align:start position:0%
Richard headed I am the government
 
00:54:23.150 --> 00:54:23.160 align:start position:0%
Affairs coordinator for the judicial
 
00:54:25.829 --> 00:54:25.839 align:start position:0%
branch um and I wanted we're not we do
 
00:54:27.990 --> 00:54:28.000 align:start position:0%
not have a position on Parts two and
 
00:54:29.270 --> 00:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
three of the bill but I did want to
 
00:54:31.750 --> 00:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
testify to give some information and
 
00:54:35.430 --> 00:54:35.440 align:start position:0%
background um and uh and to speak to
 
00:54:38.430 --> 00:54:38.440 align:start position:0%
some of the questions that were asked
 
00:54:41.549 --> 00:54:41.559 align:start position:0%
earlier the the bill itself would remove
 
00:54:43.789 --> 00:54:43.799 align:start position:0%
what is probably the most effective tool
 
00:54:46.069 --> 00:54:46.079 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch has for enforcing
 
00:54:49.150 --> 00:54:49.160 align:start position:0%
obligations to appear in court um and to
 
00:54:52.030 --> 00:54:52.040 align:start position:0%
pay fines that are in default but in
 
00:54:55.069 --> 00:54:55.079 align:start position:0%
doing that I do want to make clear that
 
00:54:57.190 --> 00:54:57.200 align:start position:0%
we do not simply pull a driver's license
 
00:54:59.069 --> 00:54:59.079 align:start position:0%
when somebody goes into default when we
 
00:55:00.829 --> 00:55:00.839 align:start position:0%
don't have that ability it's a
 
00:55:04.030 --> 00:55:04.040 align:start position:0%
coordinated um uh connection with the
 
00:55:06.870 --> 00:55:06.880 align:start position:0%
Department of Motor Vehicles but we take
 
00:55:09.470 --> 00:55:09.480 align:start position:0%
initial steps um within our our the
 
00:55:12.470 --> 00:55:12.480 align:start position:0%
Court's normal processes to get
 
00:55:14.510 --> 00:55:14.520 align:start position:0%
compliance that does not have any
 
00:55:15.829 --> 00:55:15.839 align:start position:0%
relationship with the Department of
 
00:55:18.870 --> 00:55:18.880 align:start position:0%
Motor Vehicles or pulling a a driver's
 
00:55:22.670 --> 00:55:22.680 align:start position:0%
license um if it and if we do get to
 
00:55:25.510 --> 00:55:25.520 align:start position:0%
that stage where we do see to have a
 
00:55:29.549 --> 00:55:29.559 align:start position:0%
driver's license um revoked it is not an
 
00:55:31.589 --> 00:55:31.599 align:start position:0%
automatic process it does not happen
 
00:55:36.150 --> 00:55:36.160 align:start position:0%
upon the request it is more uh a further
 
00:55:38.230 --> 00:55:38.240 align:start position:0%
tap on the shoulder for the party that
 
00:55:40.510 --> 00:55:40.520 align:start position:0%
is involved because they get a notice
 
00:55:44.029 --> 00:55:44.039 align:start position:0%
and they say please contact the court um
 
00:55:46.510 --> 00:55:46.520 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say please do pay the fine
 
00:55:48.710 --> 00:55:48.720 align:start position:0%
immediately it says please contact the
 
00:55:51.670 --> 00:55:51.680 align:start position:0%
court um so that Arrangements can be
 
00:55:51.680 --> 00:55:53.750 align:start position:0%
court um so that Arrangements can be
made

00:55:53.750 --> 00:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
made
 
00:55:58.670 --> 00:55:58.680 align:start position:0%
and in and if that happens we are we are
 
00:56:01.630 --> 00:56:01.640 align:start position:0%
we work very hard with parties if they
 
00:56:05.349 --> 00:56:05.359 align:start position:0%
are unable to pay a fine um but we do
 
00:56:07.789 --> 00:56:07.799 align:start position:0%
find or we do believe that the
 
00:56:10.190 --> 00:56:10.200 align:start position:0%
obligation to appear in court and the
 
00:56:12.670 --> 00:56:12.680 align:start position:0%
obligation to pay fines is extremely
 
00:56:15.390 --> 00:56:15.400 align:start position:0%
important but I also recognize this
 
00:56:17.990 --> 00:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
committee's uh duty to balance public
 
00:56:21.029 --> 00:56:21.039 align:start position:0%
interest and public needs
 
00:56:23.390 --> 00:56:23.400 align:start position:0%
but you know we do want to make very
 
00:56:26.349 --> 00:56:26.359 align:start position:0%
clear this is not a a a switch that goes
 
00:56:29.589 --> 00:56:29.599 align:start position:0%
on and off uh when the court uh
 
00:56:31.910 --> 00:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
identifies a a party in default of
 
00:56:34.829 --> 00:56:34.839 align:start position:0%
either appearing in court or paying of
 
00:56:38.470 --> 00:56:38.480 align:start position:0%
fines um there's a process and there is
 
00:56:41.470 --> 00:56:41.480 align:start position:0%
a strong desire to resolve the issue
 
00:56:44.750 --> 00:56:44.760 align:start position:0%
with the parties uh to ensure compliance
 
00:56:46.109 --> 00:56:46.119 align:start position:0%
with with their
 
00:56:48.589 --> 00:56:48.599 align:start position:0%
duties um in the other aspect of this
 
00:56:51.750 --> 00:56:51.760 align:start position:0%
you know if we don't have um a driver's
 
00:56:54.390 --> 00:56:54.400 align:start position:0%
license tool really the only other
 
00:56:57.190 --> 00:56:57.200 align:start position:0%
available tool is the Assurance of a
 
00:56:59.710 --> 00:56:59.720 align:start position:0%
bench warrant uh which has its own
 
00:57:02.910 --> 00:57:02.920 align:start position:0%
implications um but also does not is not
 
00:57:05.549 --> 00:57:05.559 align:start position:0%
terribly effective if it is an outof
 
00:57:07.589 --> 00:57:07.599 align:start position:0%
State party because that would only
 
00:57:10.150 --> 00:57:10.160 align:start position:0%
really get triggered if they're back in
 
00:57:11.910 --> 00:57:11.920 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire and they get
 
00:57:15.270 --> 00:57:15.280 align:start position:0%
pulled over um so it's you know it's a
 
00:57:17.309 --> 00:57:17.319 align:start position:0%
it's not a terribly effective tool and
 
00:57:19.349 --> 00:57:19.359 align:start position:0%
also has its own
 
00:57:21.230 --> 00:57:21.240 align:start position:0%
ramifications and then the other option
 
00:57:24.510 --> 00:57:24.520 align:start position:0%
is simply stop collecting on these which
 
00:57:26.789 --> 00:57:26.799 align:start position:0%
would then have significant financial
 
00:57:30.069 --> 00:57:30.079 align:start position:0%
ramifications to to the state of New
 
00:57:33.430 --> 00:57:33.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um so I do you know I
 
00:57:35.589 --> 00:57:35.599 align:start position:0%
recognize the the the balancing of
 
00:57:38.589 --> 00:57:38.599 align:start position:0%
interests that um that the legislature
 
00:57:41.589 --> 00:57:41.599 align:start position:0%
has to has to consider but I do just
 
00:57:43.710 --> 00:57:43.720 align:start position:0%
want to make clear it's not you know as
 
00:57:45.990 --> 00:57:46.000 align:start position:0%
simple you're in default you lose your
 
00:57:48.150 --> 00:57:48.160 align:start position:0%
license there is a process and there's a
 
00:57:49.910 --> 00:57:49.920 align:start position:0%
very strong desire with the courts to
 
00:57:52.829 --> 00:57:52.839 align:start position:0%
work with parties uh to ensure that they
 
00:57:56.630 --> 00:57:56.640 align:start position:0%
can uh resolve any uh past any
 
00:57:58.670 --> 00:57:58.680 align:start position:0%
defaults the other point I wanted to
 
00:58:00.470 --> 00:58:00.480 align:start position:0%
make and this is actually a request we
 
00:58:03.029 --> 00:58:03.039 align:start position:0%
have on the bill itself uh if it is to
 
00:58:05.069 --> 00:58:05.079 align:start position:0%
go forward it has an effective date of
 
00:58:09.630 --> 00:58:09.640 align:start position:0%
60 days um and rate up until a little
 
00:58:11.829 --> 00:58:11.839 align:start position:0%
over a year year plus I guess maybe a
 
00:58:15.309 --> 00:58:15.319 align:start position:0%
couple years ago um this was a a manual
 
00:58:17.230 --> 00:58:17.240 align:start position:0%
process between the court system and the
 
00:58:20.829 --> 00:58:20.839 align:start position:0%
department or and DMV um that became
 
00:58:23.190 --> 00:58:23.200 align:start position:0%
highly automated with our what we call
 
00:58:25.230 --> 00:58:25.240 align:start position:0%
Odyssey system and the Department of
 
00:58:27.470 --> 00:58:27.480 align:start position:0%
Motor Vehicle system uh we actually
 
00:58:30.069 --> 00:58:30.079 align:start position:0%
spent a fair amount of time and effort
 
00:58:34.390 --> 00:58:34.400 align:start position:0%
to be able to connect the two um and I
 
00:58:38.150 --> 00:58:38.160 align:start position:0%
think this arose out of the the deaths
 
00:58:40.750 --> 00:58:40.760 align:start position:0%
of the motorcyclist in the North country
 
00:58:42.750 --> 00:58:42.760 align:start position:0%
and a desire to start having systems
 
00:58:45.950 --> 00:58:45.960 align:start position:0%
talk to each other uh automatically so I
 
00:58:47.990 --> 00:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
think as part of that we undertook that
 
00:58:49.510 --> 00:58:49.520 align:start position:0%
effort uh and it was a fairly
 
00:58:52.589 --> 00:58:52.599 align:start position:0%
significant effort um and to unwind it
 
00:58:55.309 --> 00:58:55.319 align:start position:0%
is also going to be significant um it's
 
00:58:58.750 --> 00:58:58.760 align:start position:0%
not simply uh a pulling a connection or
 
00:59:02.390 --> 00:59:02.400 align:start position:0%
or unclicking a box um there was a a
 
00:59:05.430 --> 00:59:05.440 align:start position:0%
significant amount of of effort because
 
00:59:08.470 --> 00:59:08.480 align:start position:0%
our Odyssey database is very detailed
 
00:59:11.150 --> 00:59:11.160 align:start position:0%
it's it has sort of crazy connections
 
00:59:13.390 --> 00:59:13.400 align:start position:0%
and the process of making any changes to
 
00:59:16.270 --> 00:59:16.280 align:start position:0%
it takes a fair amount of time uh and
 
00:59:18.349 --> 00:59:18.359 align:start position:0%
actually has some costs associated with
 
00:59:22.430 --> 00:59:22.440 align:start position:0%
it um and on top of of this bill would
 
00:59:24.029 --> 00:59:24.039 align:start position:0%
be you know the hundreds of other
 
00:59:26.069 --> 00:59:26.079 align:start position:0%
changes come out of any legislative
 
00:59:28.349 --> 00:59:28.359 align:start position:0%
session so anytime there's a new felony
 
00:59:31.390 --> 00:59:31.400 align:start position:0%
a new miss any new crime uh added or
 
00:59:33.910 --> 00:59:33.920 align:start position:0%
modified we have to change your database
 
00:59:37.190 --> 00:59:37.200 align:start position:0%
and it requires again a great deal of of
 
00:59:38.870 --> 00:59:38.880 align:start position:0%
um not only just changing it but to
 
00:59:41.349 --> 00:59:41.359 align:start position:0%
ensure the accuracy of those changes
 
00:59:44.069 --> 00:59:44.079 align:start position:0%
because they drill down uh into into
 
00:59:46.150 --> 00:59:46.160 align:start position:0%
various sections of of criminal
 
00:59:48.390 --> 00:59:48.400 align:start position:0%
statutes um and I would just point out
 
00:59:52.829 --> 00:59:52.839 align:start position:0%
that RSA 14 colon 9-a talks about um
 
00:59:55.470 --> 00:59:55.480 align:start position:0%
effective dates of bills uh in that
 
00:59:58.510 --> 00:59:58.520 align:start position:0%
statute says that any uh law affecting
 
01:00:00.990 --> 01:00:01.000 align:start position:0%
judicial practice and procedure then
 
01:00:03.390 --> 01:00:03.400 align:start position:0%
goes on or changes uh criminal
 
01:00:05.510 --> 01:00:05.520 align:start position:0%
prohibitions or or civil causes of
 
01:00:08.750 --> 01:00:08.760 align:start position:0%
actions should be shall take effect
 
01:00:11.950 --> 01:00:11.960 align:start position:0%
January 1 of the following year so we do
 
01:00:14.670 --> 01:00:14.680 align:start position:0%
ask that if this bill is to proceed that
 
01:00:16.750 --> 01:00:16.760 align:start position:0%
the effective date be changed to at a
 
01:00:19.230 --> 01:00:19.240 align:start position:0%
minimum January 1
 
01:00:22.470 --> 01:00:22.480 align:start position:0%
2022 um as opposed to the current uh
 
01:00:24.270 --> 01:00:24.280 align:start position:0%
effective date which is 60 days after
 
01:00:26.990 --> 01:00:27.000 align:start position:0%
pass message um January to tell you the
 
01:00:29.710 --> 01:00:29.720 align:start position:0%
truth January 1 would be very tight um
 
01:00:33.430 --> 01:00:33.440 align:start position:0%
and we would vastly prefer uh later on
 
01:00:36.510 --> 01:00:36.520 align:start position:0%
in 2022 um simply to make sure we get
 
01:00:40.430 --> 01:00:40.440 align:start position:0%
the systems corrected uh or modified if
 
01:00:42.630 --> 01:00:42.640 align:start position:0%
that's the way this the legislature
 
01:00:45.630 --> 01:00:45.640 align:start position:0%
decides to go um and to give us time to
 
01:00:47.349 --> 01:00:47.359 align:start position:0%
do that correctly and accurately so
 
01:00:49.910 --> 01:00:49.920 align:start position:0%
there are no errors going forward with
 
01:00:51.349 --> 01:00:51.359 align:start position:0%
that I'd be happy to take questions and
 
01:00:52.910 --> 01:00:52.920 align:start position:0%
if I don't know the answers I'll be
 
01:00:55.430 --> 01:00:55.440 align:start position:0%
happy to to try to track down answer ERS
 
01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:56.470 align:start position:0%
happy to to try to track down answer ERS
thank

01:00:56.470 --> 01:00:56.480 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:00:59.470 --> 01:00:59.480 align:start position:0%
you see one question representative Eric
 
01:01:01.430 --> 01:01:01.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you Mr head
 
01:01:06.390 --> 01:01:06.400 align:start position:0%
for testifying today uh about this uh my
 
01:01:10.270 --> 01:01:10.280 align:start position:0%
question is so if someone
 
01:01:13.630 --> 01:01:13.640 align:start position:0%
is has got their license
 
01:01:17.309 --> 01:01:17.319 align:start position:0%
suspended uh as result of uh non-payment
 
01:01:17.319 --> 01:01:18.870 align:start position:0%
suspended uh as result of uh non-payment
of

01:01:18.870 --> 01:01:18.880 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:01:22.029 --> 01:01:22.039 align:start position:0%
fines and they are in the process of
 
01:01:25.750 --> 01:01:25.760 align:start position:0%
paying these fines back um how does the
 
01:01:30.470 --> 01:01:30.480 align:start position:0%
license get reinstated in full and is do
 
01:01:32.309 --> 01:01:32.319 align:start position:0%
they even do that like when they're
 
01:01:35.829 --> 01:01:35.839 align:start position:0%
partially through their payments or do
 
01:01:38.829 --> 01:01:38.839 align:start position:0%
they have to wait until the the fines
 
01:01:40.309 --> 01:01:40.319 align:start position:0%
are completely
 
01:01:43.230 --> 01:01:43.240 align:start position:0%
paid how do how does that whole um
 
01:01:46.549 --> 01:01:46.559 align:start position:0%
reinstatement work sure so part of it is
 
01:01:48.510 --> 01:01:48.520 align:start position:0%
will be and I don't know and I apologize
 
01:01:50.309 --> 01:01:50.319 align:start position:0%
for that but some of that's on the DMV
 
01:01:53.510 --> 01:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
side but from our perspective once they
 
01:01:55.910 --> 01:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
have made arrangements ments and they
 
01:01:58.549 --> 01:01:58.559 align:start position:0%
they're complying we do not you know
 
01:02:00.430 --> 01:02:00.440 align:start position:0%
we're not asking anyone to hold
 
01:02:03.349 --> 01:02:03.359 align:start position:0%
someone's driver's license in suspension
 
01:02:06.069 --> 01:02:06.079 align:start position:0%
pending all payments you know we the the
 
01:02:11.829 --> 01:02:11.839 align:start position:0%
goal of um of the of the process is to
 
01:02:13.870 --> 01:02:13.880 align:start position:0%
ensure they've reached out to the court
 
01:02:16.670 --> 01:02:16.680 align:start position:0%
system they've put in to place either
 
01:02:19.150 --> 01:02:19.160 align:start position:0%
they've pay they pay the fine uh or they
 
01:02:21.870 --> 01:02:21.880 align:start position:0%
explain their absence um or they put a
 
01:02:23.349 --> 01:02:23.359 align:start position:0%
plan together as to how they're going to
 
01:02:25.789 --> 01:02:25.799 align:start position:0%
pay it we're done we don't you know
 
01:02:27.910 --> 01:02:27.920 align:start position:0%
there's not a we're not going to hold
 
01:02:30.510 --> 01:02:30.520 align:start position:0%
the license pending 100% of the payments
 
01:02:33.430 --> 01:02:33.440 align:start position:0%
it's uh it's the desire that they reach
 
01:02:36.190 --> 01:02:36.200 align:start position:0%
out get a essentially a new order if
 
01:02:41.630 --> 01:02:41.640 align:start position:0%
that's needed um and uh exactly how DMV
 
01:02:44.069 --> 01:02:44.079 align:start position:0%
reinstates I that part of it I I
 
01:02:46.630 --> 01:02:46.640 align:start position:0%
apologize I just do not
 
01:02:49.910 --> 01:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
know okay thank you so much see
 
01:02:52.510 --> 01:02:52.520 align:start position:0%
representative kki thank you very much
 
01:02:54.069 --> 01:02:54.079 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you Mr head for taking
 
01:02:57.069 --> 01:02:57.079 align:start position:0%
my question question um to me this sort
 
01:02:57.079 --> 01:02:58.309 align:start position:0%
my question question um to me this sort
of

01:02:58.309 --> 01:02:58.319 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:03:01.549 --> 01:03:01.559 align:start position:0%
feels like a downward spiral that people
 
01:03:03.269 --> 01:03:03.279 align:start position:0%
could have a very difficult time getting
 
01:03:06.309 --> 01:03:06.319 align:start position:0%
out of and I know you're not the person
 
01:03:07.870 --> 01:03:07.880 align:start position:0%
who might have the answer to this but
 
01:03:09.230 --> 01:03:09.240 align:start position:0%
isn't it true that if you have your
 
01:03:12.029 --> 01:03:12.039 align:start position:0%
license suspended there's another fee to
 
01:03:14.710 --> 01:03:14.720 align:start position:0%
then get your license reinstated once
 
01:03:17.230 --> 01:03:17.240 align:start position:0%
you have that ability to get your
 
01:03:20.230 --> 01:03:20.240 align:start position:0%
license reinstated you know I I believe
 
01:03:21.910 --> 01:03:21.920 align:start position:0%
that to be true I don't know that that's
 
01:03:25.470 --> 01:03:25.480 align:start position:0%
a DMV question um but they very well may
 
01:03:29.430 --> 01:03:29.440 align:start position:0%
have post suspension a a process for for
 
01:03:31.190 --> 01:03:31.200 align:start position:0%
reinstatement and I don't know what the
 
01:03:34.150 --> 01:03:34.160 align:start position:0%
waving option is for that and it may be
 
01:03:35.870 --> 01:03:35.880 align:start position:0%
you know if that's a if that's the
 
01:03:38.750 --> 01:03:38.760 align:start position:0%
concern if there is a license suspended
 
01:03:41.789 --> 01:03:41.799 align:start position:0%
because of default maybe you know by
 
01:03:44.670 --> 01:03:44.680 align:start position:0%
Statute you eliminate that fee to ensure
 
01:03:45.789 --> 01:03:45.799 align:start position:0%
a smoother
 
01:03:48.710 --> 01:03:48.720 align:start position:0%
restoration um that may be a that may be
 
01:03:51.190 --> 01:03:51.200 align:start position:0%
a different type of of approach for this
 
01:03:53.470 --> 01:03:53.480 align:start position:0%
type of legislation to to avoid that
 
01:03:56.349 --> 01:03:56.359 align:start position:0%
downward spire viral but not take away
 
01:03:59.390 --> 01:03:59.400 align:start position:0%
that sort of really the the most
 
01:04:02.670 --> 01:04:02.680 align:start position:0%
significant tool that's available um to
 
01:04:05.630 --> 01:04:05.640 align:start position:0%
ensure sort of compliance with with
 
01:04:07.710 --> 01:04:07.720 align:start position:0%
duties to appear in court and to pay
 
01:04:10.950 --> 01:04:10.960 align:start position:0%
fines so I I I appreciate your question
 
01:04:14.029 --> 01:04:14.039 align:start position:0%
and it's a good one it is one I don't
 
01:04:16.190 --> 01:04:16.200 align:start position:0%
you know it's the side of of the agency
 
01:04:17.829 --> 01:04:17.839 align:start position:0%
that or it's within an agency that we
 
01:04:20.269 --> 01:04:20.279 align:start position:0%
don't have any control
 
01:04:23.230 --> 01:04:23.240 align:start position:0%
over um I'm happy to reach out to the to
 
01:04:25.269 --> 01:04:25.279 align:start position:0%
the um Commission though and and see if
 
01:04:28.549 --> 01:04:28.559 align:start position:0%
I can find an answer it helps director B
 
01:04:31.710 --> 01:04:31.720 align:start position:0%
is on Deck so oh great then then
 
01:04:34.870 --> 01:04:34.880 align:start position:0%
hopefully she'll have that answer thank
 
01:04:37.470 --> 01:04:37.480 align:start position:0%
you still have a question thank you Mr
 
01:04:40.029 --> 01:04:40.039 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you Mr ke for taking my
 
01:04:43.190 --> 01:04:43.200 align:start position:0%
question uh can you give me a sense of
 
01:04:46.029 --> 01:04:46.039 align:start position:0%
we're talking about collecting fees here
 
01:04:48.109 --> 01:04:48.119 align:start position:0%
can you give me total give me a sense of
 
01:04:49.950 --> 01:04:49.960 align:start position:0%
what kind of total dollars of fines we
 
01:04:51.630 --> 01:04:51.640 align:start position:0%
talk and I guess what I'm asking is how
 
01:04:54.630 --> 01:04:54.640 align:start position:0%
big is this bucket in terms of you know
 
01:04:56.109 --> 01:04:56.119 align:start position:0%
collecting these
 
01:04:58.230 --> 01:04:58.240 align:start position:0%
fines um thank you thank you for the
 
01:05:01.829 --> 01:05:01.839 align:start position:0%
question um I don't so one of the oh I
 
01:05:04.269 --> 01:05:04.279 align:start position:0%
do have some numbers uh with a caveat
 
01:05:07.470 --> 01:05:07.480 align:start position:0%
that I don't have a separation between
 
01:05:10.230 --> 01:05:10.240 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle and non-motor vehicle so
 
01:05:13.870 --> 01:05:13.880 align:start position:0%
that part I apologize on um but and
 
01:05:16.510 --> 01:05:16.520 align:start position:0%
these are numbers from 2019 as opposed
 
01:05:18.349 --> 01:05:18.359 align:start position:0%
to 2020 because the pandemic sort of
 
01:05:20.589 --> 01:05:20.599 align:start position:0%
screwed everything up um but we were
 
01:05:24.630 --> 01:05:24.640 align:start position:0%
talking total fines of about $14 million
 
01:05:28.470 --> 01:05:28.480 align:start position:0%
about 60% of those were at some point at
 
01:05:29.750 --> 01:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
some level of
 
01:05:34.150 --> 01:05:34.160 align:start position:0%
default um so uh in terms of of those
 
01:05:36.670 --> 01:05:36.680 align:start position:0%
numbers roughly 9 million and again that
 
01:05:38.390 --> 01:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean 9 million you're triggering
 
01:05:41.510 --> 01:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
a driver's license but that's sort of
 
01:05:44.990 --> 01:05:45.000 align:start position:0%
they're at some stage of of a
 
01:05:47.589 --> 01:05:47.599 align:start position:0%
default so it's it's a significant
 
01:05:52.789 --> 01:05:52.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:55.390 --> 01:05:55.400 align:start position:0%
you one thank you I'm sorry I just want
 
01:05:57.950 --> 01:05:57.960 align:start position:0%
one clarification if possible um thank
 
01:05:59.990 --> 01:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
you Mr head
 
01:06:03.950 --> 01:06:03.960 align:start position:0%
um when you were discussing what other
 
01:06:07.710 --> 01:06:07.720 align:start position:0%
options the courts have for making
 
01:06:10.549 --> 01:06:10.559 align:start position:0%
someone appear um I just want you to
 
01:06:13.510 --> 01:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
clarify that because you only listed one
 
01:06:16.750 --> 01:06:16.760 align:start position:0%
possible option um is there uh which was
 
01:06:19.390 --> 01:06:19.400 align:start position:0%
issuance of a bench warrant um there's
 
01:06:21.069 --> 01:06:21.079 align:start position:0%
got to be
 
01:06:23.430 --> 01:06:23.440 align:start position:0%
other uh penalties or something that
 
01:06:26.069 --> 01:06:26.079 align:start position:0%
could be done to call the person in
 
01:06:29.029 --> 01:06:29.039 align:start position:0%
again it just seems that um taking away
 
01:06:31.349 --> 01:06:31.359 align:start position:0%
someone's ability to work and get the
 
01:06:34.670 --> 01:06:34.680 align:start position:0%
funds needed to pay the fine is just um
 
01:06:38.910 --> 01:06:38.920 align:start position:0%
is a dog chasing his tail um can you
 
01:06:40.670 --> 01:06:40.680 align:start position:0%
just explain again why that's the only
 
01:06:45.269 --> 01:06:45.279 align:start position:0%
option possible sure so um you we do
 
01:06:47.150 --> 01:06:47.160 align:start position:0%
they would already get some written
 
01:06:50.630 --> 01:06:50.640 align:start position:0%
notice from from the court um they get a
 
01:06:53.390 --> 01:06:53.400 align:start position:0%
written notice from Department of Motor
 
01:06:55.430 --> 01:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
Vehicles that they have 30 days before
 
01:06:59.069 --> 01:06:59.079 align:start position:0%
they're going to be suspended we do have
 
01:07:00.750 --> 01:07:00.760 align:start position:0%
um within some defaults there's some
 
01:07:02.190 --> 01:07:02.200 align:start position:0%
mandatory fines there's some
 
01:07:04.710 --> 01:07:04.720 align:start position:0%
discretionary fines so we can add to the
 
01:07:07.470 --> 01:07:07.480 align:start position:0%
fines but that seems counterproductive
 
01:07:10.870 --> 01:07:10.880 align:start position:0%
also as as you suggested relative to the
 
01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:11.789 align:start position:0%
also as as you suggested relative to the
downward

01:07:11.789 --> 01:07:11.799 align:start position:0%
downward
 
01:07:15.470 --> 01:07:15.480 align:start position:0%
spiral um and we have some of these are
 
01:07:21.710 --> 01:07:21.720 align:start position:0%
out of state um but you know um there's
 
01:07:24.430 --> 01:07:24.440 align:start position:0%
not a terribly
 
01:07:26.990 --> 01:07:27.000 align:start position:0%
the we don't really have any other tools
 
01:07:29.029 --> 01:07:29.039 align:start position:0%
you know the driver's license is sort of
 
01:07:31.029 --> 01:07:31.039 align:start position:0%
the most effective one if the driver's
 
01:07:33.750 --> 01:07:33.760 align:start position:0%
license is an essential component of
 
01:07:36.710 --> 01:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
somebody's livelihood which I appreciate
 
01:07:38.990 --> 01:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
and certainly understand um I drive to
 
01:07:43.710 --> 01:07:43.720 align:start position:0%
work you know I I get that um they what
 
01:07:46.710 --> 01:07:46.720 align:start position:0%
we're asking is that they respond to the
 
01:07:50.190 --> 01:07:50.200 align:start position:0%
letter and say um you know how do I how
 
01:07:51.750 --> 01:07:51.760 align:start position:0%
do I manage this you know this is the
 
01:07:53.589 --> 01:07:53.599 align:start position:0%
reason I can't pay okay we'll work with
 
01:07:56.069 --> 01:07:56.079 align:start position:0%
them um
 
01:07:59.069 --> 01:07:59.079 align:start position:0%
so if somebody has a good idea I'm happy
 
01:08:00.589 --> 01:08:00.599 align:start position:0%
to listen but there you know they're
 
01:08:05.789 --> 01:08:05.799 align:start position:0%
really not a lot of of uh of options and
 
01:08:08.109 --> 01:08:08.119 align:start position:0%
it's not all money and and so I I just
 
01:08:10.430 --> 01:08:10.440 align:start position:0%
want to make clear that part of this is
 
01:08:12.549 --> 01:08:12.559 align:start position:0%
you know obligations just to to appear
 
01:08:17.030 --> 01:08:17.040 align:start position:0%
in court um and that is uh an important
 
01:08:20.149 --> 01:08:20.159 align:start position:0%
obligation you know we it it causes you
 
01:08:21.950 --> 01:08:21.960 align:start position:0%
know if one party doesn't show the party
 
01:08:24.669 --> 01:08:24.679 align:start position:0%
that does show has to reappear um at
 
01:08:27.390 --> 01:08:27.400 align:start position:0%
times it it causes tremendous burden on
 
01:08:30.470 --> 01:08:30.480 align:start position:0%
the on the court system on the parties
 
01:08:35.510 --> 01:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
on uh on Witnesses you know it has a a a
 
01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:36.669 align:start position:0%
on uh on Witnesses you know it has a a a
sort

01:08:36.669 --> 01:08:36.679 align:start position:0%
sort
 
01:08:40.110 --> 01:08:40.120 align:start position:0%
of effect um a broader effect than
 
01:08:44.709 --> 01:08:44.719 align:start position:0%
simply somebody not showing up um
 
01:08:47.950 --> 01:08:47.960 align:start position:0%
so I don't have a good answer other than
 
01:08:50.149 --> 01:08:50.159 align:start position:0%
than sort of what I've already outlined
 
01:08:51.910 --> 01:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
U if there was a better and easier tool
 
01:08:54.789 --> 01:08:54.799 align:start position:0%
we would certainly use it um this has
 
01:08:59.189 --> 01:08:59.199 align:start position:0%

Vehicles the department is taking a
 
01:09:46.470 --> 01:09:46.480 align:start position:0%
neutral position on this bill as well we
 
01:09:49.910 --> 01:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
do believe that oh can I we can barely
 
01:09:52.709 --> 01:09:52.719 align:start position:0%
hear you oh I'm sorry let me see if I
 
01:09:55.630 --> 01:09:55.640 align:start position:0%
can increase
 
01:09:58.390 --> 01:09:58.400 align:start position:0%
my volume
 
01:10:01.910 --> 01:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
here give me just one
 
01:10:04.870 --> 01:10:04.880 align:start position:0%
minute is that better oh much much
 
01:10:07.149 --> 01:10:07.159 align:start position:0%
better okay all right yeah there's just
 
01:10:08.470 --> 01:10:08.480 align:start position:0%
a couple settings in there that
 
01:10:10.630 --> 01:10:10.640 align:start position:0%
sometimes change so again um for the
 
01:10:12.470 --> 01:10:12.480 align:start position:0%
record my name is Elizabeth Bei director
 
01:10:14.550 --> 01:10:14.560 align:start position:0%
of Motor Vehicles we are taking a
 
01:10:16.510 --> 01:10:16.520 align:start position:0%
neutral position on this bill um
 
01:10:17.910 --> 01:10:17.920 align:start position:0%
believing that it is a matter of
 
01:10:20.510 --> 01:10:20.520 align:start position:0%
legislative policy um I really am going
 
01:10:22.669 --> 01:10:22.679 align:start position:0%
to be brief and then I'll um open up for
 
01:10:25.270 --> 01:10:25.280 align:start position:0%
any questions my only question on the
 
01:10:27.430 --> 01:10:27.440 align:start position:0%
bill is just some language that leaves
 
01:10:31.110 --> 01:10:31.120 align:start position:0%
um some question in our minds as to what
 
01:10:33.830 --> 01:10:33.840 align:start position:0%
is the intent of it um because there is
 
01:10:35.950 --> 01:10:35.960 align:start position:0%
some language in here for example where
 
01:10:39.110 --> 01:10:39.120 align:start position:0%
it speaks to um the fact that we can
 
01:10:41.030 --> 01:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
suspend a license for someone who fails
 
01:10:43.709 --> 01:10:43.719 align:start position:0%
to comply for example with an order of
 
01:10:47.669 --> 01:10:47.679 align:start position:0%
the director or or a court with with on
 
01:10:49.070 --> 01:10:49.080 align:start position:0%
any matter within the director's or
 
01:10:50.870 --> 01:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
Court's Jurisdiction so there Still
 
01:10:53.709 --> 01:10:53.719 align:start position:0%
Remains a question as to what judicial
 
01:10:56.950 --> 01:10:56.960 align:start position:0%
um proceedings would result in a license
 
01:11:00.149 --> 01:11:00.159 align:start position:0%
suspension as well um
 
01:11:03.110 --> 01:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
similarly um there is another provision
 
01:11:05.310 --> 01:11:05.320 align:start position:0%
in here that speaks or leaves that
 
01:11:08.149 --> 01:11:08.159 align:start position:0%
language related to uh compliance with
 
01:11:11.030 --> 01:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
an order of the director of a court so
 
01:11:13.350 --> 01:11:13.360 align:start position:0%
um I would really ask that the judicial
 
01:11:15.270 --> 01:11:15.280 align:start position:0%
branch looks closer and that so that we
 
01:11:16.990 --> 01:11:17.000 align:start position:0%
clearly understand what would fall
 
01:11:18.750 --> 01:11:18.760 align:start position:0%
within the scope of a license suspension
 
01:11:20.189 --> 01:11:20.199 align:start position:0%
when there is some language related to
 
01:11:22.950 --> 01:11:22.960 align:start position:0%
Court's Jurisdiction in here as well um
 
01:11:25.189 --> 01:11:25.199 align:start position:0%
outside of that I will just open up um
 
01:11:26.390 --> 01:11:26.400 align:start position:0%
with for any questions that the
 
01:11:28.590 --> 01:11:28.600 align:start position:0%
committee might
 
01:11:31.310 --> 01:11:31.320 align:start position:0%
have thank you director any questions
 
01:11:33.270 --> 01:11:33.280 align:start position:0%
from the committee
 
01:11:36.149 --> 01:11:36.159 align:start position:0%
yeah representative Aaron thank you Mr
 
01:11:38.470 --> 01:11:38.480 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you um director
 
01:11:41.510 --> 01:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
biki my question is I I had asked this
 
01:11:44.270 --> 01:11:44.280 align:start position:0%
question before of another uh person I
 
01:11:47.270 --> 01:11:47.280 align:start position:0%
was wondering if you knew um the
 
01:11:51.149 --> 01:11:51.159 align:start position:0%
percentage of license suspensions for
 
01:11:54.510 --> 01:11:54.520 align:start position:0%
drivers infractions versus say Court
 
01:11:56.590 --> 01:11:56.600 align:start position:0%
findes you know something that's not
 
01:11:59.669 --> 01:11:59.679 align:start position:0%
driver related do you do you know any
 
01:12:02.229 --> 01:12:02.239 align:start position:0%
numbers for that um I don't have those
 
01:12:04.550 --> 01:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
numbers available but we can definitely
 
01:12:06.270 --> 01:12:06.280 align:start position:0%
um take a closer look to see if we can
 
01:12:08.790 --> 01:12:08.800 align:start position:0%
provide those numbers to you in working
 
01:12:11.310 --> 01:12:11.320 align:start position:0%
with the judicial branch as well thank
 
01:12:12.550 --> 01:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
you and
 
01:12:15.270 --> 01:12:15.280 align:start position:0%
followup thank you Mr chair um my
 
01:12:17.510 --> 01:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
followup question is do you have any
 
01:12:20.470 --> 01:12:20.480 align:start position:0%
idea what the average time is that
 
01:12:22.470 --> 01:12:22.480 align:start position:0%
somebody's license is
 
01:12:25.990 --> 01:12:26.000 align:start position:0%
suspended I I really don't and as one of
 
01:12:27.709 --> 01:12:27.719 align:start position:0%
the other speakers testified I know that
 
01:12:30.270 --> 01:12:30.280 align:start position:0%
the court works with um with their
 
01:12:32.030 --> 01:12:32.040 align:start position:0%
customers to give them a number of
 
01:12:35.310 --> 01:12:35.320 align:start position:0%
different opportunities to um to really
 
01:12:37.310 --> 01:12:37.320 align:start position:0%
cure the issues that are in front of the
 
01:12:40.390 --> 01:12:40.400 align:start position:0%
courts and then once that information is
 
01:12:43.590 --> 01:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
sent over to us we also provide um the
 
01:12:45.149 --> 01:12:45.159 align:start position:0%
customers with a notice before their
 
01:12:47.229 --> 01:12:47.239 align:start position:0%
license is suspended but as far as the
 
01:12:49.750 --> 01:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
duration of a license related to those
 
01:12:51.390 --> 01:12:51.400 align:start position:0%
type of suspensions I really can't
 
01:12:55.030 --> 01:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
answer that question thank you
 
01:12:57.270 --> 01:12:57.280 align:start position:0%

transportation committee I'm in the
 
01:24:11.350 --> 01:24:11.360 align:start position:0%
middle like the chairman our ninth year
 
01:24:14.390 --> 01:24:14.400 align:start position:0%
working on bills um one of the things
 
01:24:16.430 --> 01:24:16.440 align:start position:0%
that I've been particularly proud of
 
01:24:19.149 --> 01:24:19.159 align:start position:0%
over the years working with uh the
 
01:24:21.350 --> 01:24:21.360 align:start position:0%
chairman with representative Smith and
 
01:24:23.590 --> 01:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
other and other members of the committee
 
01:24:26.709 --> 01:24:26.719 align:start position:0%
we've always managed to find our way to
 
01:24:29.830 --> 01:24:29.840 align:start position:0%
good solutions to public policy that
 
01:24:33.629 --> 01:24:33.639 align:start position:0%
needs some need our attention and um I'm
 
01:24:35.229 --> 01:24:35.239 align:start position:0%
very proud of the work that we have done
 
01:24:38.910 --> 01:24:38.920 align:start position:0%
to solve those kinds of things um during
 
01:24:41.109 --> 01:24:41.119 align:start position:0%
that same nine years we've also had an
 
01:24:44.629 --> 01:24:44.639 align:start position:0%
opportunity to
 
01:24:47.149 --> 01:24:47.159 align:start position:0%
um examine what it is that we're
 
01:24:48.510 --> 01:24:48.520 align:start position:0%
actually trying to do here in the
 
01:24:50.189 --> 01:24:50.199 align:start position:0%
transportation committee and those
 
01:24:53.229 --> 01:24:53.239 align:start position:0%
things are uh primarily
 
01:24:56.870 --> 01:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
focused on five areas of policy one is
 
01:24:59.229 --> 01:24:59.239 align:start position:0%
to improve Public Safety that clearly is
 
01:25:03.270 --> 01:25:03.280 align:start position:0%
our number one uh issue next is to
 
01:25:05.990 --> 01:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
provide expanded Social Services maybe
 
01:25:08.950 --> 01:25:08.960 align:start position:0%
to also improve implementation of
 
01:25:11.510 --> 01:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
Criminal Justice as it applies to the
 
01:25:14.910 --> 01:25:14.920 align:start position:0%
transportation sector we also try very
 
01:25:17.350 --> 01:25:17.360 align:start position:0%
hard to encourage the development and
 
01:25:19.550 --> 01:25:19.560 align:start position:0%
expansion of improving
 
01:25:21.350 --> 01:25:21.360 align:start position:0%
Technologies something that we've done
 
01:25:23.550 --> 01:25:23.560 align:start position:0%
quite successfully over the years and
 
01:25:26.950 --> 01:25:26.960 align:start position:0%
finally that we're also always working
 
01:25:29.390 --> 01:25:29.400 align:start position:0%
towards improving Economic Development
 
01:25:32.189 --> 01:25:32.199 align:start position:0%
by the tools that uh are impacted by
 
01:25:32.199 --> 01:25:33.270 align:start position:0%
by the tools that uh are impacted by
this

01:25:33.270 --> 01:25:33.280 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:25:36.270 --> 01:25:36.280 align:start position:0%
sector um so I wanted to remind the

we uh are supporting this bill and we're
 
01:28:29.070 --> 01:28:29.080 align:start position:0%
asking that the committee uh voted ought
 
01:28:31.870 --> 01:28:31.880 align:start position:0%
to pass um I just want to start out with
 
01:28:34.030 --> 01:28:34.040 align:start position:0%
just highlighting the points in that
 
01:28:37.590 --> 01:28:37.600 align:start position:0%
letter uh for clarification for folks um
 
01:28:41.510 --> 01:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
the first thing is immigration law is is
 
01:28:46.270 --> 01:28:46.280 align:start position:0%
part of this issue we're hoping that um
 
01:28:48.830 --> 01:28:48.840 align:start position:0%
that we can expand the group of people
 
01:28:51.350 --> 01:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
that are eligible to apply for dri's
 
01:28:53.870 --> 01:28:53.880 align:start position:0%
licenses in New Hampshire to include
 
01:28:56.709 --> 01:28:56.719 align:start position:0%
people who are undocumented immigrants
 
01:28:58.709 --> 01:28:58.719 align:start position:0%
now it's really important to understand
 
01:29:01.910 --> 01:29:01.920 align:start position:0%
that undocumented immigrants um that's
 
01:29:05.390 --> 01:29:05.400 align:start position:0%
not a criminal offense the federal
 
01:29:08.109 --> 01:29:08.119 align:start position:0%
government has seen fit to make most
 
01:29:11.310 --> 01:29:11.320 align:start position:0%
immigration law infractions civil law
 
01:29:13.830 --> 01:29:13.840 align:start position:0%
infractions so being undocumented is not
 
01:29:15.189 --> 01:29:15.199 align:start position:0%
a criminal offense and that's very
 
01:29:17.669 --> 01:29:17.679 align:start position:0%
important to understand and know the
 
01:29:19.310 --> 01:29:19.320 align:start position:0%
other thing is we we believe there's
 
01:29:22.430 --> 01:29:22.440 align:start position:0%
about 14,000 undocumented IM migrants
 
01:29:24.750 --> 01:29:24.760 align:start position:0%
living in New Hampshire these are people
 
01:29:26.350 --> 01:29:26.360 align:start position:0%
who have been contributing to our
 
01:29:29.390 --> 01:29:29.400 align:start position:0%
community who have relatives who are US
 
01:29:31.870 --> 01:29:31.880 align:start position:0%
citizens and otherwise lawfully present
 
01:29:34.390 --> 01:29:34.400 align:start position:0%
who have children in our school system
 
01:29:36.669 --> 01:29:36.679 align:start position:0%
who are in sometimes essential workers
 
01:29:40.350 --> 01:29:40.360 align:start position:0%
during this pandemic they pay about $77
 
01:29:44.550 --> 01:29:44.560 align:start position:0%
million in taxes federal state and local
 
01:29:48.390 --> 01:29:48.400 align:start position:0%
taxes um and that we we need to really
 
01:29:50.830 --> 01:29:50.840 align:start position:0%
recognize their contribution and their
 
01:29:54.550 --> 01:29:54.560 align:start position:0%
need to be able to to to uh safely uh
 
01:29:58.790 --> 01:29:58.800 align:start position:0%
travel throughout the state uh we we ask
 
01:30:01.350 --> 01:30:01.360 align:start position:0%
um that New Hampshire join the many
 
01:30:05.070 --> 01:30:05.080 align:start position:0%
other states 17 jurisdictions so far who
 
01:30:07.870 --> 01:30:07.880 align:start position:0%
have um decided to grant driers licenses
 
01:30:11.590 --> 01:30:11.600 align:start position:0%
to undocumented immigrants um this will
 
01:30:14.990 --> 01:30:15.000 align:start position:0%
remove a law enforcement burden that's
 
01:30:17.430 --> 01:30:17.440 align:start position:0%
unnecessary it will increase Public
 
01:30:20.790 --> 01:30:20.800 align:start position:0%
Safety by allowing um law enforcement
 
01:30:24.310 --> 01:30:24.320 align:start position:0%
and the DMV to process people make sure
 
01:30:26.350 --> 01:30:26.360 align:start position:0%
that they're eligible that make sure
 
01:30:29.350 --> 01:30:29.360 align:start position:0%
that they know the uh rules of the road
 
01:30:32.189 --> 01:30:32.199 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and comply with them
 
01:30:34.990 --> 01:30:35.000 align:start position:0%
and take tests to be able to drive
 
01:30:39.669 --> 01:30:39.679 align:start position:0%
safely um so I we we have uh reached out
 
01:30:42.669 --> 01:30:42.679 align:start position:0%
to the law enforcement community and we
 
01:30:45.310 --> 01:30:45.320 align:start position:0%
have received support from many law
 
01:30:47.310 --> 01:30:47.320 align:start position:0%
enforcement entities and we ask you to
 
01:30:52.030 --> 01:30:52.040 align:start position:0%
take um notice of that um it will also
 
01:30:55.830 --> 01:30:55.840 align:start position:0%
increase Community well-being and life
 
01:30:58.470 --> 01:30:58.480 align:start position:0%
um people within the Immigrant Community
 
01:31:01.950 --> 01:31:01.960 align:start position:0%
including people who are US citizens and
 
01:31:05.430 --> 01:31:05.440 align:start position:0%
um lawfully present are often afraid of
 
01:31:08.149 --> 01:31:08.159 align:start position:0%
encounters with law enforcement um
 
01:31:10.910 --> 01:31:10.920 align:start position:0%
because of the fear that people will be
 
01:31:15.910 --> 01:31:15.920 align:start position:0%
seized um and so that contributes to
 
01:31:18.189 --> 01:31:18.199 align:start position:0%
fear of reporting legitimate crimes and
 
01:31:20.350 --> 01:31:20.360 align:start position:0%
other problems in the neighborhood and
 
01:31:22.390 --> 01:31:22.400 align:start position:0%
being able to establish trusting
 
01:31:24.310 --> 01:31:24.320 align:start position:0%
relationships with the law enforcement
 
01:31:27.870 --> 01:31:27.880 align:start position:0%

been raised in the past few years about
 
01:32:44.669 --> 01:32:44.679 align:start position:0%
this legislation uh first uh this
 
01:32:46.310 --> 01:32:46.320 align:start position:0%

the driver's license except for the
 
01:33:54.950 --> 01:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
purpose of operating a motor vehicle
 
01:33:56.950 --> 01:33:56.960 align:start position:0%
more specifically I would like to talk
 
01:33:59.790 --> 01:33:59.800 align:start position:0%
about voting since the establishment of
 
01:34:02.510 --> 01:34:02.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire as a state only US
 
01:34:04.830 --> 01:34:04.840 align:start position:0%
citizens have been charged with voter
 
01:34:07.910 --> 01:34:07.920 align:start position:0%
fraud in most cases the person charged
 
01:34:11.350 --> 01:34:11.360 align:start position:0%
is a retired US citizen who lives in New
 
01:34:13.629 --> 01:34:13.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and in another state which
 
01:34:15.870 --> 01:34:15.880 align:start position:0%
most recently is the case of Vincent
 
01:34:20.070 --> 01:34:20.080 align:start position:0%
Marcelo 65 of West Lebanon furthermore
 
01:34:22.229 --> 01:34:22.239 align:start position:0%
the concern of noncitizens voting is
 
01:34:24.470 --> 01:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
already addressed in several provisions
 
01:34:26.950 --> 01:34:26.960 align:start position:0%
of the immigration nationality act which
 
01:34:29.550 --> 01:34:29.560 align:start position:0%
effectively deter immigrants from
 
01:34:32.350 --> 01:34:32.360 align:start position:0%
claiming to be US citizens for example
 
01:34:34.669 --> 01:34:34.679 align:start position:0%
immigrants would be permanently barred
 
01:34:38.350 --> 01:34:38.360 align:start position:0%
from receiving any immigration benefit
 
01:34:41.390 --> 01:34:41.400 align:start position:0%
under Ina section 237
 
01:34:45.070 --> 01:34:45.080 align:start position:0%
a3d from if they claim to be a US
 
01:34:48.030 --> 01:34:48.040 align:start position:0%
citizen in order to register to vote one
 
01:34:50.350 --> 01:34:50.360 align:start position:0%
must prove their identity by showing a
 
01:34:52.070 --> 01:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
US birth certificate
 
01:34:55.229 --> 01:34:55.239 align:start position:0%
a US passport or a US naturalization
 
01:34:57.669 --> 01:34:57.679 align:start position:0%
certificate the driver's license is
 
01:35:01.149 --> 01:35:01.159 align:start position:0%
merely to prove residency in the state
 
01:35:03.390 --> 01:35:03.400 align:start position:0%
nonetheless I would like to stress that
 
01:35:06.350 --> 01:35:06.360 align:start position:0%
for more reasons voting in favor of this
 
01:35:08.390 --> 01:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
bill is the right thing to do as
 
01:35:11.030 --> 01:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
thousands of lives are in your hands and
 
01:35:13.550 --> 01:35:13.560 align:start position:0%
you can make a difference in their lives
 
01:35:16.430 --> 01:35:16.440 align:start position:0%
as immigrants contribute a great deal to
 
01:35:18.550 --> 01:35:18.560 align:start position:0%

the Assembly of God bethl in New
 
01:36:35.030 --> 01:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh I represent the
 
01:36:38.310 --> 01:36:38.320 align:start position:0%
community uh as well not only the church
 
01:36:42.790 --> 01:36:42.800 align:start position:0%
but um part of the uh uh the community
 
01:36:48.149 --> 01:36:48.159 align:start position:0%
uh uh leadership and uh the reason why I
 
01:36:50.270 --> 01:36:50.280 align:start position:0%
wanted to to to speak about this is
 
01:36:52.750 --> 01:36:52.760 align:start position:0%
because I used to be a police officer
 
01:36:55.550 --> 01:36:55.560 align:start position:0%
back in Brazil and I understand the uh
 
01:36:59.070 --> 01:36:59.080 align:start position:0%
the importancy for the police to to to
 
01:37:01.149 --> 01:37:01.159 align:start position:0%
to to know that
 
01:37:03.709 --> 01:37:03.719 align:start position:0%
everyone have a driver's license in
 
01:37:07.790 --> 01:37:07.800 align:start position:0%
their pocket when they stop a
 
01:37:10.830 --> 01:37:10.840 align:start position:0%
person uh what they're looking for is
 
01:37:14.790 --> 01:37:14.800 align:start position:0%
just the uh the uh the driver's license
 
01:37:17.430 --> 01:37:17.440 align:start position:0%
which allows them to drive a car in the
 
01:37:21.270 --> 01:37:21.280 align:start position:0%
roads of New Hampshire so uh we've been
 
01:37:22.910 --> 01:37:22.920 align:start position:0%
meeting with all the uh the police
 
01:37:26.030 --> 01:37:26.040 align:start position:0%
departments in in New Hampshire uh Mo I
 
01:37:28.270 --> 01:37:28.280 align:start position:0%
mean not all of them but a lot of them
 
01:37:31.910 --> 01:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
and they all agree that uh it's better
 
01:37:34.709 --> 01:37:34.719 align:start position:0%
for them to have a person with the
 
01:37:36.510 --> 01:37:36.520 align:start position:0%
driver's license with something that
 
01:37:39.109 --> 01:37:39.119 align:start position:0%
they can identify the persons persons
 
01:37:41.910 --> 01:37:41.920 align:start position:0%
with and uh and thinking about the the
 
01:37:44.189 --> 01:37:44.199 align:start position:0%
community these people like it's been
 
01:37:46.350 --> 01:37:46.360 align:start position:0%
said already they're part of the
 
01:37:48.510 --> 01:37:48.520 align:start position:0%
community they're they have their kids
 
01:37:51.350 --> 01:37:51.360 align:start position:0%
in school they they're contributing with
 
01:37:54.189 --> 01:37:54.199 align:start position:0%
taxes for the state for the uh for the
 
01:37:56.709 --> 01:37:56.719 align:start position:0%
city for the for the for the country
 
01:37:58.990 --> 01:37:59.000 align:start position:0%
they they they're working they're
 
01:38:01.669 --> 01:38:01.679 align:start position:0%
producing and they need to go to the to
 
01:38:03.550 --> 01:38:03.560 align:start position:0%
the doctor's appointment they need to go
 
01:38:06.470 --> 01:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
to school they need to to go about their
 
01:38:09.669 --> 01:38:09.679 align:start position:0%
business and what happen is without
 
01:38:12.669 --> 01:38:12.679 align:start position:0%
having any opportunity for them to have
 
01:38:15.470 --> 01:38:15.480 align:start position:0%
a driver's license they're to Survivor
 
01:38:17.149 --> 01:38:17.159 align:start position:0%
to survive and they they're driving
 
01:38:18.950 --> 01:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
without a license this is this is no
 
01:38:21.470 --> 01:38:21.480 align:start position:0%
good this is no good for the uh for the
 
01:38:23.430 --> 01:38:23.440 align:start position:0%
state this is no good for the public
 
01:38:25.070 --> 01:38:25.080 align:start position:0%
this is no good for
 
01:38:27.910 --> 01:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
security uh of the of the state the city
 
01:38:30.430 --> 01:38:30.440 align:start position:0%
and the and the individuals the the
 
01:38:35.070 --> 01:38:35.080 align:start position:0%
American people so I I encourage
 
01:38:37.430 --> 01:38:37.440 align:start position:0%
everybody who who's voting to to think
 
01:38:40.350 --> 01:38:40.360 align:start position:0%
about those things because uh uh they're
 
01:38:43.629 --> 01:38:43.639 align:start position:0%
driving on the roads without a license
 
01:38:45.709 --> 01:38:45.719 align:start position:0%
it's not that not that they want to
 
01:38:47.430 --> 01:38:47.440 align:start position:0%
drive without a license but because they
 
01:38:49.629 --> 01:38:49.639 align:start position:0%
have no no opportunity they have no
 
01:38:51.510 --> 01:38:51.520 align:start position:0%
possibility there's no fine that they
 
01:38:54.629 --> 01:38:54.639 align:start position:0%
should pay to get a license there is no
 
01:38:56.629 --> 01:38:56.639 align:start position:0%
open doors there's nothing there's
 
01:38:59.390 --> 01:38:59.400 align:start position:0%
nothing that they can do and like I said
 
01:39:01.589 --> 01:39:01.599 align:start position:0%
before in order for them to survive they
 
01:39:04.669 --> 01:39:04.679 align:start position:0%
need to find a way driving a riding a
 
01:39:08.149 --> 01:39:08.159 align:start position:0%
bike is not an option the whole year
 
01:39:10.589 --> 01:39:10.599 align:start position:0%
because of the weather So eventually
 
01:39:12.830 --> 01:39:12.840 align:start position:0%
they're going to drive
 
01:39:17.669 --> 01:39:17.679 align:start position:0%
and uh and uh even even for the uh for
 
01:39:20.470 --> 01:39:20.480 align:start position:0%
the National Security having somebody
 
01:39:22.229 --> 01:39:22.239 align:start position:0%
with an ident
 
01:39:25.870 --> 01:39:25.880 align:start position:0%
in their pocket is is is a is better to
 
01:39:29.830 --> 01:39:29.840 align:start position:0%
even hold them accountable for whatever
 
01:39:31.950 --> 01:39:31.960 align:start position:0%
crime they commit if they don't have
 
01:39:33.550 --> 01:39:33.560 align:start position:0%
anything in their pocket they can say
 
01:39:36.070 --> 01:39:36.080 align:start position:0%
whoever they are and the police is not
 
01:39:38.669 --> 01:39:38.679 align:start position:0%
going to be able to to to find out who
 
01:39:40.750 --> 01:39:40.760 align:start position:0%
they are they can give different names
 
01:39:43.910 --> 01:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
and stuff so
 
01:39:46.109 --> 01:39:46.119 align:start position:0%
me just to be fair to everybody it's
 
01:39:49.189 --> 01:39:49.199 align:start position:0%
been three minutes plus I'll give you a
 
01:39:53.189 --> 01:39:53.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:54.990 --> 01:39:55.000 align:start position:0%
yeah um I mean I thank you very much for
 
01:39:57.149 --> 01:39:57.159 align:start position:0%
the time and uh I just want to close
 
01:40:00.750 --> 01:40:00.760 align:start position:0%
with the with the uh testimony of uh a
 
01:40:05.109 --> 01:40:05.119 align:start position:0%
person uh in our church who is a pastor
 
01:40:07.990 --> 01:40:08.000 align:start position:0%
he's a pastor but he doesn't have the
 
01:40:10.910 --> 01:40:10.920 align:start position:0%
license and he was stopped by the police
 
01:40:13.550 --> 01:40:13.560 align:start position:0%
the police called the uh the
 
01:40:16.430 --> 01:40:16.440 align:start position:0%
immigration the immigration starts a
 
01:40:18.950 --> 01:40:18.960 align:start position:0%
process there there's no hope because
 
01:40:21.229 --> 01:40:21.239 align:start position:0%
there's no law to protect the uh at
 
01:40:23.709 --> 01:40:23.719 align:start position:0%
least to to give him a a way out that he
 
01:40:26.430 --> 01:40:26.440 align:start position:0%
can pay a fine or whatever and get the
 
01:40:29.669 --> 01:40:29.679 align:start position:0%
papers so it's just something that is
 
01:40:31.990 --> 01:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
complicating the family he's got three
 
01:40:35.310 --> 01:40:35.320 align:start position:0%
kids and a wife and he has no way out
 
01:40:37.709 --> 01:40:37.719 align:start position:0%
because he wants to follow the law but
 
01:40:41.229 --> 01:40:41.239 align:start position:0%
there is no option that the state is
 
01:40:44.350 --> 01:40:44.360 align:start position:0%
given to him to be right with the law so
 
01:40:46.550 --> 01:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and I hope uh I hope
 
01:40:49.550 --> 01:40:49.560 align:start position:0%

and some of the surrounding towns
 
01:41:56.629 --> 01:41:56.639 align:start position:0%
including Bedford and Manchester uh we
 
01:41:59.350 --> 01:41:59.360 align:start position:0%
all feel very strongly about this uh and
 
01:42:02.350 --> 01:42:02.360 align:start position:0%
so what I want to say is we as police
 
01:42:04.350 --> 01:42:04.360 align:start position:0%
officers in this day and age have been
 
01:42:06.910 --> 01:42:06.920 align:start position:0%
tasked with uh improving relations with
 
01:42:08.910 --> 01:42:08.920 align:start position:0%
all community members it's been a very
 
01:42:10.750 --> 01:42:10.760 align:start position:0%
tough time for law enforcement it's very
 
01:42:14.310 --> 01:42:14.320 align:start position:0%
been a very tense time um it's because
 
01:42:18.270 --> 01:42:18.280 align:start position:0%
of all those um issues we've engaged
 
01:42:19.709 --> 01:42:19.719 align:start position:0%
with community members we've gotten out
 
01:42:21.510 --> 01:42:21.520 align:start position:0%
we've had meetings with many different
 
01:42:23.470 --> 01:42:23.480 align:start position:0%
minority groups in the community of all
 
01:42:25.750 --> 01:42:25.760 align:start position:0%
different shapes and sizes and basically
 
01:42:27.189 --> 01:42:27.199 align:start position:0%
through that we get to know them we get
 
01:42:28.470 --> 01:42:28.480 align:start position:0%
to know them as people we get to know
 
01:42:30.070 --> 01:42:30.080 align:start position:0%
them as moms and dads bringing their
 
01:42:32.149 --> 01:42:32.159 align:start position:0%
kids to schools parents going to work
 
01:42:33.750 --> 01:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
trying to get their uh to the grocery
 
01:42:35.910 --> 01:42:35.920 align:start position:0%
store and back trying to get to the CVS
 
01:42:37.629 --> 01:42:37.639 align:start position:0%
to get their kids medicin all these
 
01:42:38.990 --> 01:42:39.000 align:start position:0%
things that we take for granted every
 
01:42:41.390 --> 01:42:41.400 align:start position:0%
day we've gotten these undocumented
 
01:42:43.589 --> 01:42:43.599 align:start position:0%
people um who can't do that or have to
 
01:42:45.790 --> 01:42:45.800 align:start position:0%
do so in fear of being stopped and
 
01:42:48.470 --> 01:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
arrested by us um and that's just wrong
 
01:42:51.350 --> 01:42:51.360 align:start position:0%
it's it's wrong for people who uh who do
 
01:42:52.830 --> 01:42:52.840 align:start position:0%
the right thing have no criminal record
 
01:42:54.229 --> 01:42:54.239 align:start position:0%
are just trying to live their lives and
 
01:42:56.629 --> 01:42:56.639 align:start position:0%
be productive members of society to not
 
01:42:58.830 --> 01:42:58.840 align:start position:0%
be able to do so what we're asking for
 
01:43:01.109 --> 01:43:01.119 align:start position:0%
is simply for a group of people to be
 
01:43:03.189 --> 01:43:03.199 align:start position:0%
able to show that they are aware of the
 
01:43:04.589 --> 01:43:04.599 align:start position:0%
rules in the road and can pass it
 
01:43:06.350 --> 01:43:06.360 align:start position:0%
through a written test and can get in a
 
01:43:08.510 --> 01:43:08.520 align:start position:0%
car with a with a certified instructor
 
01:43:10.550 --> 01:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
and prove that they can drive a vehicle
 
01:43:11.910 --> 01:43:11.920 align:start position:0%
then they're held to the St same
 
01:43:13.950 --> 01:43:13.960 align:start position:0%
standards as everybody else they have to
 
01:43:15.390 --> 01:43:15.400 align:start position:0%
register their cars they have to pay for
 
01:43:16.589 --> 01:43:16.599 align:start position:0%
their licensing they have to have
 
01:43:18.189 --> 01:43:18.199 align:start position:0%
insurance or they should be having
 
01:43:20.430 --> 01:43:20.440 align:start position:0%
insurance so all those things uh would
 
01:43:23.390 --> 01:43:23.400 align:start position:0%
help help everybody and allow them to be
 
01:43:25.550 --> 01:43:25.560 align:start position:0%
normal members of society and continue
 
01:43:27.350 --> 01:43:27.360 align:start position:0%
to be the productive members of society
 
01:43:29.950 --> 01:43:29.960 align:start position:0%
that they are um it's it's to me it's
 
01:43:31.709 --> 01:43:31.719 align:start position:0%
the right thing to do and it will save
 
01:43:34.189 --> 01:43:34.199 align:start position:0%
our law our law enforcement communities
 
01:43:35.830 --> 01:43:35.840 align:start position:0%
won't have to stop them and be dealing
 
01:43:37.629 --> 01:43:37.639 align:start position:0%
with operating after suspension
 
01:43:40.109 --> 01:43:40.119 align:start position:0%
arresting somebody having people who are
 
01:43:42.070 --> 01:43:42.080 align:start position:0%
victims of sexual assault crimes not
 
01:43:43.990 --> 01:43:44.000 align:start position:0%
feel comfortable reporting crimes
 
01:43:45.510 --> 01:43:45.520 align:start position:0%
because they don't want to be stopped if
 
01:43:49.470 --> 01:43:49.480 align:start position:0%
they're undocumented so it's for us I I
 
01:43:51.270 --> 01:43:51.280 align:start position:0%
think it's a it's a
 
01:43:54.070 --> 01:43:54.080 align:start position:0%
win-win situation there is no negative
 
01:43:56.270 --> 01:43:56.280 align:start position:0%
the license to drive is not a license to
 
01:43:58.149 --> 01:43:58.159 align:start position:0%
vote these folks can't get out and go to
 
01:44:00.270 --> 01:44:00.280 align:start position:0%
the polls and vote for uh in any
 
01:44:03.390 --> 01:44:03.400 align:start position:0%
elections so it's really a positive
 
01:44:04.910 --> 01:44:04.920 align:start position:0%
thing to do and I will wrap up real
 
01:44:06.350 --> 01:44:06.360 align:start position:0%
quick I want to thank you for your time
 
01:44:08.229 --> 01:44:08.239 align:start position:0%
I will challenge each of you to go out
 
01:44:09.830 --> 01:44:09.840 align:start position:0%
into your communities and get to know
 
01:44:11.870 --> 01:44:11.880 align:start position:0%
some of the undocumented that work hard
 
01:44:13.669 --> 01:44:13.679 align:start position:0%
and have their kids in school listen to
 
01:44:15.550 --> 01:44:15.560 align:start position:0%
their stories and listen to their fears
 
01:44:17.270 --> 01:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
and please just pay attention all we're
 
01:44:19.750 --> 01:44:19.760 align:start position:0%
asking for is a a privilege to drive a
 
01:44:22.350 --> 01:44:22.360 align:start position:0%
car legally and that's it thank you very
 
01:44:24.470 --> 01:44:24.480 align:start position:0%
much for the time I appreciate it thank
 
01:44:25.510 --> 01:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
you very
 
01:44:28.709 --> 01:44:28.719 align:start position:0%
much will you take any
 
01:44:32.669 --> 01:44:32.679 align:start position:0%
questions questions yes sir represent
 
01:44:34.790 --> 01:44:34.800 align:start position:0%
flers thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:44:36.430 --> 01:44:36.440 align:start position:0%
chief carrian for coming and speaking
 
01:44:39.310 --> 01:44:39.320 align:start position:0%
with us today um I know you were trying
 
01:44:42.229 --> 01:44:42.239 align:start position:0%
to be be brief but you did touch on the
 
01:44:46.470 --> 01:44:46.480 align:start position:0%
fact that um the fear of being in touch
 
01:44:48.109 --> 01:44:48.119 align:start position:0%
with the police could prevent someone
 
01:44:51.109 --> 01:44:51.119 align:start position:0%
from um reporting a sexual assault
 
01:44:54.430 --> 01:44:54.440 align:start position:0%
or some other crime do you feel that if
 
01:44:57.950 --> 01:44:57.960 align:start position:0%
a undocumented community members do have
 
01:45:00.189 --> 01:45:00.199 align:start position:0%
that legal license and they know that
 
01:45:03.070 --> 01:45:03.080 align:start position:0%
they're not going to be um putting
 
01:45:05.510 --> 01:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
themselves in Jeopardy um by contacting
 
01:45:09.910 --> 01:45:09.920 align:start position:0%
the police that that would in turn um
 
01:45:13.669 --> 01:45:13.679 align:start position:0%
improve um the community and the the way
 
01:45:15.709 --> 01:45:15.719 align:start position:0%
that these community members can
 
01:45:18.270 --> 01:45:18.280 align:start position:0%
participate um in the process of keeping
 
01:45:20.229 --> 01:45:20.239 align:start position:0%
our city here in Nashua a safe place to
 
01:45:20.239 --> 01:45:21.390 align:start position:0%
our city here in Nashua a safe place to
live

01:45:21.390 --> 01:45:21.400 align:start position:0%
live
 
01:45:23.910 --> 01:45:23.920 align:start position:0%
absolutely 100% I agree with that it
 
01:45:25.950 --> 01:45:25.960 align:start position:0%
would give people for the most part
 
01:45:28.070 --> 01:45:28.080 align:start position:0%
people um the undocumented are not
 
01:45:30.229 --> 01:45:30.239 align:start position:0%
committing any crimes with the exception
 
01:45:32.390 --> 01:45:32.400 align:start position:0%
of driving without a license so if they
 
01:45:33.950 --> 01:45:33.960 align:start position:0%
could have that license and get to and
 
01:45:35.589 --> 01:45:35.599 align:start position:0%
from work they're much more comfortable
 
01:45:36.950 --> 01:45:36.960 align:start position:0%
talking to us they're much more
 
01:45:38.350 --> 01:45:38.360 align:start position:0%
comfortable if they do commit a motor
 
01:45:40.550 --> 01:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
vehicle violations they get stopped they
 
01:45:42.390 --> 01:45:42.400 align:start position:0%
get a ticket they pay their fine like
 
01:45:44.950 --> 01:45:44.960 align:start position:0%
everybody else with that Comfort comes
 
01:45:46.510 --> 01:45:46.520 align:start position:0%
the trust in law enforcement that we're
 
01:45:48.510 --> 01:45:48.520 align:start position:0%
there to help and that trust is what
 
01:45:50.070 --> 01:45:50.080 align:start position:0%
we're working so hard and we've been
 
01:45:52.350 --> 01:45:52.360 align:start position:0%
working tirelessly over the past 5 years
 
01:45:54.350 --> 01:45:54.360 align:start position:0%
to try to get that trust so they will
 
01:45:56.350 --> 01:45:56.360 align:start position:0%
come to us because driving without a
 
01:45:58.430 --> 01:45:58.440 align:start position:0%
license isn't a big deal somebody who's
 
01:46:00.070 --> 01:46:00.080 align:start position:0%
being a victim of domestic abuse or
 
01:46:02.030 --> 01:46:02.040 align:start position:0%
sexual assault is a huge deal and if
 
01:46:03.270 --> 01:46:03.280 align:start position:0%
they're afraid to come forward and tell
 
01:46:05.030 --> 01:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
us about it we can't help them and
 
01:46:06.109 --> 01:46:06.119 align:start position:0%
that's our mission and that's the
 
01:46:08.270 --> 01:46:08.280 align:start position:0%
priority of our mission so it's it's
 
01:46:10.229 --> 01:46:10.239 align:start position:0%
important for us to to have that trust
 
01:46:12.629 --> 01:46:12.639 align:start position:0%
and that trust if it means giving them a
 
01:46:14.990 --> 01:46:15.000 align:start position:0%
a a license to drive a vehicle and
 
01:46:16.950 --> 01:46:16.960 align:start position:0%
that's it I think that goes a long way
 
01:46:19.870 --> 01:46:19.880 align:start position:0%
to solve a huge problem for us thank you
 
01:46:19.880 --> 01:46:21.629 align:start position:0%
to solve a huge problem for us thank you
chief

01:46:21.629 --> 01:46:21.639 align:start position:0%
chief
 
01:46:21.639 --> 01:46:25.229 align:start position:0%
chief
representative

01:46:25.229 --> 01:46:25.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:27.629 --> 01:46:27.639 align:start position:0%
cleverer thank you very much Mr chairman
 
01:46:28.990 --> 01:46:29.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Chief
 
01:46:32.070 --> 01:46:32.080 align:start position:0%
Gan for all your work in nashwa and for
 
01:46:33.669 --> 01:46:33.679 align:start position:0%
coming to testify
 
01:46:36.270 --> 01:46:36.280 align:start position:0%
today appreciate it very
 
01:46:39.229 --> 01:46:39.239 align:start position:0%
much how how many interactions would you
 
01:46:41.310 --> 01:46:41.320 align:start position:0%
say would
 
01:46:44.510 --> 01:46:44.520 align:start position:0%
be on on average how many interactions
 
01:46:48.229 --> 01:46:48.239 align:start position:0%
with undocumented do you have as police
 
01:46:51.430 --> 01:46:51.440 align:start position:0%
officers during any given period any
 
01:46:54.709 --> 01:46:54.719 align:start position:0%
month say so it's it's we don't
 
01:46:56.510 --> 01:46:56.520 align:start position:0%
necessarily track that information uh
 
01:46:58.070 --> 01:46:58.080 align:start position:0%
Alderman CLE uh sorry representative
 
01:47:01.950 --> 01:47:01.960 align:start position:0%
Cleaver because we um they don't
 
01:47:03.629 --> 01:47:03.639 align:start position:0%
necessarily uh we don't ask the
 
01:47:05.109 --> 01:47:05.119 align:start position:0%
questions of their immigration status
 
01:47:06.510 --> 01:47:06.520 align:start position:0%
when we stop them so it's hard to
 
01:47:08.589 --> 01:47:08.599 align:start position:0%
document that we can usually determine
 
01:47:11.149 --> 01:47:11.159 align:start position:0%
it through arrests only and and then
 
01:47:12.589 --> 01:47:12.599 align:start position:0%
only by going through their country of
 
01:47:14.470 --> 01:47:14.480 align:start position:0%
origin and assuming that they don't have
 
01:47:15.950 --> 01:47:15.960 align:start position:0%
the license which is a lot of
 
01:47:18.790 --> 01:47:18.800 align:start position:0%
assumptions but I will say this um
 
01:47:20.790 --> 01:47:20.800 align:start position:0%
having worked in as for 28 years years
 
01:47:22.109 --> 01:47:22.119 align:start position:0%
especially the last five years having
 
01:47:24.550 --> 01:47:24.560 align:start position:0%
gotten out into the community we uh have
 
01:47:26.550 --> 01:47:26.560 align:start position:0%
a large amount of interaction with them
 
01:47:28.990 --> 01:47:29.000 align:start position:0%
and generally uh operating without a Val
 
01:47:31.669 --> 01:47:31.679 align:start position:0%
license happens hundreds of times a year
 
01:47:31.679 --> 01:47:33.109 align:start position:0%
license happens hundreds of times a year
for

01:47:33.109 --> 01:47:33.119 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:47:37.830 --> 01:47:37.840 align:start position:0%
us follow up please follow up yes so
 
01:47:40.310 --> 01:47:40.320 align:start position:0%
what you're saying then Chief is that
 
01:47:44.109 --> 01:47:44.119 align:start position:0%
the interactions with drivers is is
 
01:47:44.119 --> 01:47:45.149 align:start position:0%
the interactions with drivers is is
quite

01:47:45.149 --> 01:47:45.159 align:start position:0%

interact with um that you just mentioned
 
01:48:09.070 --> 01:48:09.080 align:start position:0%
is there a way of knowing a percentage
 
01:48:12.510 --> 01:48:12.520 align:start position:0%
of those that uh that carry um auto
 
01:48:15.430 --> 01:48:15.440 align:start position:0%
insurance when you when you run into
 
01:48:18.030 --> 01:48:18.040 align:start position:0%
them well no because right now they're
 
01:48:19.430 --> 01:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
not allowed to get a driver's license so
 
01:48:20.790 --> 01:48:20.800 align:start position:0%
I would imagine they can get the auto
 
01:48:23.350 --> 01:48:23.360 align:start position:0%
insurance um through the registered
 
01:48:25.310 --> 01:48:25.320 align:start position:0%
vehicles I don't know the answer
 
01:48:26.790 --> 01:48:26.800 align:start position:0%
completely to that but that's an
 
01:48:28.950 --> 01:48:28.960 align:start position:0%
assumption I have I will tell you this
 
01:48:31.390 --> 01:48:31.400 align:start position:0%
if they're allowed to get a license and
 
01:48:33.510 --> 01:48:33.520 align:start position:0%
do so legally they're much more inclined
 
01:48:35.350 --> 01:48:35.360 align:start position:0%
to get their license uh their vehicles
 
01:48:37.430 --> 01:48:37.440 align:start position:0%
registered get them inspected um make
 
01:48:39.070 --> 01:48:39.080 align:start position:0%
sure it's their vehicle as opposed to
 
01:48:40.589 --> 01:48:40.599 align:start position:0%
borrowing a friends who has a valid
 
01:48:42.310 --> 01:48:42.320 align:start position:0%
license so there's a there's a whole
 
01:48:44.709 --> 01:48:44.719 align:start position:0%
spiderweb of things that would be helped
 
01:48:46.870 --> 01:48:46.880 align:start position:0%
if they just had a license to drive did
 
01:48:48.669 --> 01:48:48.679 align:start position:0%
feel more comfortable obeying all those
 
01:48:50.310 --> 01:48:50.320 align:start position:0%
rules of the road if that answers your
 
01:48:53.310 --> 01:48:53.320 align:start position:0%
question it does thank you very
 
01:48:55.750 --> 01:48:55.760 align:start position:0%
much seeing no further questions thank
 
01:48:57.510 --> 01:48:57.520 align:start position:0%
you very much sir thank you everyone I
 
01:48:59.830 --> 01:48:59.840 align:start position:0%

okay Mr chair can you hear me can now
 
01:49:51.629 --> 01:49:51.639 align:start position:0%
good morning good morning I apologize

Special Olympics Mega dip which is 24
 
01:50:05.629 --> 01:50:05.639 align:start position:0%
dips in 24 hours with Chief pnan from
 
01:50:09.709 --> 01:50:09.719 align:start position:0%
NASA so um I'll cut to the chase uh
 
01:50:11.750 --> 01:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
again my name is Joseph hcky I'm a chief
 
01:50:15.390 --> 01:50:15.400 align:start position:0%
of police in in the town of Hollis um I
 
01:50:17.109 --> 01:50:17.119 align:start position:0%
don't want to reiterate too much of what
 
01:50:19.229 --> 01:50:19.239 align:start position:0%
already has been said but I can I can
 
01:50:22.030 --> 01:50:22.040 align:start position:0%
assure you that as a as a chief uh my
 
01:50:25.430 --> 01:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
job is to be apolitical and I act upon
 
01:50:27.669 --> 01:50:27.679 align:start position:0%
what I feel is right um for Public
 
01:50:29.510 --> 01:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
Safety what's
 
01:50:32.870 --> 01:50:32.880 align:start position:0%
just and uh what's in the best interest
 
01:50:35.229 --> 01:50:35.239 align:start position:0%
of our state and our community since
 
01:50:37.149 --> 01:50:37.159 align:start position:0%
I've been a police officer which is 20
 
01:50:40.669 --> 01:50:40.679 align:start position:0%
years we have dealt with the same issue
 
01:50:42.910 --> 01:50:42.920 align:start position:0%
of undocumented persons operating
 
01:50:45.470 --> 01:50:45.480 align:start position:0%
Vehicles without drivers licenses a
 
01:50:47.709 --> 01:50:47.719 align:start position:0%
large majority of these people are
 
01:50:50.149 --> 01:50:50.159 align:start position:0%
merely from my personal experience as as
 
01:50:53.550 --> 01:50:53.560 align:start position:0%
a as a patrol officer for several years
 
01:50:56.030 --> 01:50:56.040 align:start position:0%
were merely attempting to travel to and
 
01:50:58.629 --> 01:50:58.639 align:start position:0%
from work or were attempting to drive
 
01:51:01.709 --> 01:51:01.719 align:start position:0%
their families uh to you know certain
 
01:51:04.109 --> 01:51:04.119 align:start position:0%
events such as doctor's appointments or
 
01:51:07.709 --> 01:51:07.719 align:start position:0%
school events um as we've heard many
 
01:51:10.350 --> 01:51:10.360 align:start position:0%
times before we can't simply arrest our
 
01:51:12.950 --> 01:51:12.960 align:start position:0%
way out of an issue we can't simply
 
01:51:12.960 --> 01:51:13.910 align:start position:0%
way out of an issue we can't simply
issue

01:51:13.910 --> 01:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:51:17.030 --> 01:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
summons uh to navigate our way out of a
 
01:51:20.189 --> 01:51:20.199 align:start position:0%
problem um and again my testimony is not
 
01:51:23.109 --> 01:51:23.119 align:start position:0%
to address issues such as voting but
 
01:51:25.109 --> 01:51:25.119 align:start position:0%
from a public strictly from a public
 
01:51:27.990 --> 01:51:28.000 align:start position:0%
safety perspective why would we not have
 
01:51:31.189 --> 01:51:31.199 align:start position:0%
a mechanism in place that allows people
 
01:51:33.430 --> 01:51:33.440 align:start position:0%
undocumented persons living in the state
 
01:51:35.709 --> 01:51:35.719 align:start position:0%
with a means to demonstrate that they
 
01:51:38.589 --> 01:51:38.599 align:start position:0%
can safely and legally operate a motor
 
01:51:42.629 --> 01:51:42.639 align:start position:0%
vehicle not only does this um uh show
 
01:51:44.950 --> 01:51:44.960 align:start position:0%
that they can be proficient and
 
01:51:47.310 --> 01:51:47.320 align:start position:0%
demonstrate that they can safely do so
 
01:51:49.669 --> 01:51:49.679 align:start position:0%
it also helps my officers because it
 
01:51:51.149 --> 01:51:51.159 align:start position:0%
provides provides them with a way to
 
01:51:53.550 --> 01:51:53.560 align:start position:0%
obtain accurate information so if they
 
01:51:55.750 --> 01:51:55.760 align:start position:0%
write a summons they know that the
 
01:51:58.270 --> 01:51:58.280 align:start position:0%
person listed on that summons is who
 
01:52:01.510 --> 01:52:01.520 align:start position:0%
they say they are um also in terms of
 
01:52:04.430 --> 01:52:04.440 align:start position:0%
NEX ofkin notifications if there's a a
 
01:52:06.430 --> 01:52:06.440 align:start position:0%
traffic accident we have to notify
 
01:52:08.669 --> 01:52:08.679 align:start position:0%
family members oftentimes with
 
01:52:11.109 --> 01:52:11.119 align:start position:0%
undocumented persons we don't have that
 
01:52:13.910 --> 01:52:13.920 align:start position:0%
and it complicates things and then you
 
01:52:15.350 --> 01:52:15.360 align:start position:0%
think about the revenue this would
 
01:52:17.750 --> 01:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
generate for the state I mean there's
 
01:52:19.910 --> 01:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
seven you know roughly 17,000
 
01:52:22.149 --> 01:52:22.159 align:start position:0%
undocumented persons and you know we
 
01:52:24.950 --> 01:52:24.960 align:start position:0%
know that not everyone drives but um
 
01:52:26.470 --> 01:52:26.480 align:start position:0%
we're as eligible to drive but think
 
01:52:28.229 --> 01:52:28.239 align:start position:0%
about the revenue that we create for the
 
01:52:30.629 --> 01:52:30.639 align:start position:0%
state if we could you know uh provide a
 
01:52:33.830 --> 01:52:33.840 align:start position:0%
legal mechanism for these folks to get a
 
01:52:36.069 --> 01:52:36.079 align:start position:0%
driver's license so again and I'll
 
01:52:38.189 --> 01:52:38.199 align:start position:0%
summarize I'm not alone in this you
 
01:52:40.510 --> 01:52:40.520 align:start position:0%
heard from the Nashua Chief the Salem
 
01:52:42.669 --> 01:52:42.679 align:start position:0%
Chief the Hudson Chief the marac chief
 
01:52:44.910 --> 01:52:44.920 align:start position:0%
we've been working on this issue for the
 
01:52:47.750 --> 01:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
last several months with Bruno and other
 
01:52:49.910 --> 01:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
stakeholders we have we have done
 
01:52:51.910 --> 01:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
nothing in the 20 years I've been a cop
 
01:52:54.350 --> 01:52:54.360 align:start position:0%
to address this issue properly it's not
 
01:52:57.390 --> 01:52:57.400 align:start position:0%
going away we need to do something in
 
01:53:01.229 --> 01:53:01.239 align:start position:0%
order to address this issue and the fear
 
01:53:03.709 --> 01:53:03.719 align:start position:0%
component amongst minority populations
 
01:53:06.750 --> 01:53:06.760 align:start position:0%
towards po police is very real and I can
 
01:53:09.470 --> 01:53:09.480 align:start position:0%
tell you that I've met with with these
 
01:53:12.669 --> 01:53:12.679 align:start position:0%
communities and they are very afraid
 
01:53:13.870 --> 01:53:13.880 align:start position:0%
that they're going to be stopped and
 
01:53:16.350 --> 01:53:16.360 align:start position:0%
arrested and I don't think that excuse
 
01:53:16.360 --> 01:53:17.629 align:start position:0%
arrested and I don't think that excuse
me

01:53:17.629 --> 01:53:17.639 align:start position:0%
me
 
01:53:20.430 --> 01:53:20.440 align:start position:0%
Chief uh my closing is I don't think we
 
01:53:23.109 --> 01:53:23.119 align:start position:0%
should position ourselves um to create
 
01:53:25.030 --> 01:53:25.040 align:start position:0%
an environment where people are fearful
 
01:53:27.870 --> 01:53:27.880 align:start position:0%
of us because uh we have the ability to
 
01:53:30.709 --> 01:53:30.719 align:start position:0%
change something and create a process
 
01:53:32.990 --> 01:53:33.000 align:start position:0%
but we just don't do it so I certainly
 
01:53:34.550 --> 01:53:34.560 align:start position:0%
appreciate your time and I'd gladly
 
01:53:36.990 --> 01:53:37.000 align:start position:0%
answer any questions that you or the
 
01:53:39.830 --> 01:53:39.840 align:start position:0%
committee members have thank you very
 
01:53:42.669 --> 01:53:42.679 align:start position:0%
much any questions from any members of
 
01:53:42.679 --> 01:53:43.790 align:start position:0%
much any questions from any members of
the

01:53:43.790 --> 01:53:43.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:53:46.350 --> 01:53:46.360 align:start position:0%
committee represent pataro thank you
 
01:53:49.390 --> 01:53:49.400 align:start position:0%
chairman um and thank you chief for
 
01:53:51.390 --> 01:53:51.400 align:start position:0%
coming tonight I kind of wanted to ask
 
01:53:53.390 --> 01:53:53.400 align:start position:0%
this of your um colleague in nashille
 
01:53:55.709 --> 01:53:55.719 align:start position:0%
about Hudson is a Border Town as well
 
01:53:58.069 --> 01:53:58.079 align:start position:0%
I'm just I'm just curious are you in any
 
01:54:02.229 --> 01:54:02.239 align:start position:0%
way obligated if immigration forces come
 
01:54:06.589 --> 01:54:06.599 align:start position:0%
to you to turn over um criminals
 
01:54:09.350 --> 01:54:09.360 align:start position:0%
or it seems kind of Sensational how they
 
01:54:10.430 --> 01:54:10.440 align:start position:0%
portray it in the media I'm just
 
01:54:12.830 --> 01:54:12.840 align:start position:0%
wondering if you you if your department
 
01:54:15.790 --> 01:54:15.800 align:start position:0%
has any sort of direct contact Federal
 
01:54:18.109 --> 01:54:18.119 align:start position:0%
enforcement agencies concerning
 
01:54:20.430 --> 01:54:20.440 align:start position:0%
immigration yeah so I mean I work in
 
01:54:22.310 --> 01:54:22.320 align:start position:0%
hollus so that it's very limited
 
01:54:25.069 --> 01:54:25.079 align:start position:0%
occasions and there are very there are
 
01:54:26.870 --> 01:54:26.880 align:start position:0%
very strict I used to work in Hudson so
 
01:54:29.830 --> 01:54:29.840 align:start position:0%
I know it's a bit confusing but um
 
01:54:31.589 --> 01:54:31.599 align:start position:0%
there's there's very strict limitations
 
01:54:35.030 --> 01:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
on when and when you cannot contact UM
 
01:54:38.149 --> 01:54:38.159 align:start position:0%
Federal immigration uh law enforcement
 
01:54:42.629 --> 01:54:42.639 align:start position:0%
Representatives um you cannot um for
 
01:54:46.870 --> 01:54:46.880 align:start position:0%
example you cannot use um um your
 
01:54:49.790 --> 01:54:49.800 align:start position:0%
suspicion that you believe someone here
 
01:54:52.430 --> 01:54:52.440 align:start position:0%
is here illegally or is an undocumented
 
01:54:54.390 --> 01:54:54.400 align:start position:0%
person as a justification in order to
 
01:54:57.069 --> 01:54:57.079 align:start position:0%
stop and detain them it would have to be
 
01:54:59.750 --> 01:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
in conjunction with some other type of
 
01:55:01.430 --> 01:55:01.440 align:start position:0%
uh criminal offense or motor vehicle
 
01:55:02.750 --> 01:55:02.760 align:start position:0%
violation and they would have to have
 
01:55:05.470 --> 01:55:05.480 align:start position:0%
some type of detainer on them or request
 
01:55:08.069 --> 01:55:08.079 align:start position:0%
from a federal agency in in order to
 
01:55:10.109 --> 01:55:10.119 align:start position:0%
execute on that detainer I hope that
 
01:55:13.109 --> 01:55:13.119 align:start position:0%
makes sense that helps thank
 
01:55:16.149 --> 01:55:16.159 align:start position:0%
you questions see you none thank you
 
01:55:18.069 --> 01:55:18.079 align:start position:0%

recognizes Maggie fogy uh representing
 
01:55:33.189 --> 01:55:33.199 align:start position:0%
the American friend Services committee
 
01:55:43.390 --> 01:55:43.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:46.589 --> 01:55:46.599 align:start position:0%
bill hi good morning can you hear me you
 
01:55:49.069 --> 01:55:49.079 align:start position:0%
can good morning good morning thank you
 
01:55:50.750 --> 01:55:50.760 align:start position:0%
Mr chair chairman and members of the
 
01:55:53.350 --> 01:55:53.360 align:start position:0%
committee I'm I'm grateful to have a
 
01:55:55.470 --> 01:55:55.480 align:start position:0%
moment to speak with you my name is
 
01:55:57.669 --> 01:55:57.679 align:start position:0%
Maggie Fogerty I'm the director of the
 
01:55:59.709 --> 01:55:59.719 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire program for the American
 
01:56:02.229 --> 01:56:02.239 align:start position:0%
friend service committee and I'm here to
 
01:56:05.550 --> 01:56:05.560 align:start position:0%
express our strong enthusiastic support
 
01:56:08.950 --> 01:56:08.960 align:start position:0%
for HB 328 and I will speak briefly
 
01:56:10.669 --> 01:56:10.679 align:start position:0%
because the key points have been made
 
01:56:13.669 --> 01:56:13.679 align:start position:0%
well by my colleagues but I want to
 
01:56:15.310 --> 01:56:15.320 align:start position:0%
emphasize that in a state like New
 
01:56:17.470 --> 01:56:17.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire with so little infrastructure
 
01:56:20.310 --> 01:56:20.320 align:start position:0%
for public transportation driving is
 
01:56:22.390 --> 01:56:22.400 align:start position:0%
essential to the well-being of so many
 
01:56:24.709 --> 01:56:24.719 align:start position:0%
families who need a drive to their jobs
 
01:56:26.189 --> 01:56:26.199 align:start position:0%
take their children to school buy
 
01:56:27.629 --> 01:56:27.639 align:start position:0%
groceries go to healthc care
 
01:56:31.149 --> 01:56:31.159 align:start position:0%
appointments go to church and we believe
 
01:56:33.229 --> 01:56:33.239 align:start position:0%
that there should be common sense
 
01:56:35.510 --> 01:56:35.520 align:start position:0%
requirements for someone to drive safely
 
01:56:37.629 --> 01:56:37.639 align:start position:0%
on New Hampshire roads that they be able
 
01:56:41.229 --> 01:56:41.239 align:start position:0%
to show proof of of who they are proof
 
01:56:44.390 --> 01:56:44.400 align:start position:0%
of residency and proof of Competency
 
01:56:47.069 --> 01:56:47.079 align:start position:0%
through the written and practiced tests
 
01:56:49.189 --> 01:56:49.199 align:start position:0%
but there's no meaningful justification
 
01:56:51.950 --> 01:56:51.960 align:start position:0%
for immigration status to be a factor in
 
01:56:55.350 --> 01:56:55.360 align:start position:0%
this process it simply does not pertain
 
01:56:55.360 --> 01:56:56.229 align:start position:0%
this process it simply does not pertain
to

01:56:56.229 --> 01:56:56.239 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:56:59.109 --> 01:56:59.119 align:start position:0%
safety uh and the current context of US
 
01:57:02.550 --> 01:57:02.560 align:start position:0%
immigration law is too convoluted and
 
01:57:05.109 --> 01:57:05.119 align:start position:0%
chaotic and cruel to be used as a
 
01:57:07.830 --> 01:57:07.840 align:start position:0%
measure of eligibility for driving
 
01:57:09.910 --> 01:57:09.920 align:start position:0%
millions of people in the United States
 
01:57:12.149 --> 01:57:12.159 align:start position:0%
and many thousands in New Hampshire have
 
01:57:15.109 --> 01:57:15.119 align:start position:0%
been in limbo for decades they have
 
01:57:17.589 --> 01:57:17.599 align:start position:0%
every desire to regularize their status
 
01:57:20.189 --> 01:57:20.199 align:start position:0%
to continue to live and work here and to
 
01:57:22.149 --> 01:57:22.159 align:start position:0%
remain together as a family without
 
01:57:24.790 --> 01:57:24.800 align:start position:0%
threat of separation and Congress has
 
01:57:28.270 --> 01:57:28.280 align:start position:0%
failed for decades to establish a Humane
 
01:57:30.589 --> 01:57:30.599 align:start position:0%
Common Sense immigration reform it is
 
01:57:33.390 --> 01:57:33.400 align:start position:0%
past time for them to do so but in the
 
01:57:35.790 --> 01:57:35.800 align:start position:0%
meantime New Hampshire should join the
 
01:57:38.750 --> 01:57:38.760 align:start position:0%
17 other states in Washington DC to
 
01:57:40.830 --> 01:57:40.840 align:start position:0%
implement a common sense law so that
 
01:57:44.589 --> 01:57:44.599 align:start position:0%
people drive safely here people are here
 
01:57:46.910 --> 01:57:46.920 align:start position:0%
their lives are here and they shouldn't
 
01:57:50.069 --> 01:57:50.079 align:start position:0%
have this chronic stress and potential
 
01:57:52.310 --> 01:57:52.320 align:start position:0%
trauma I have seen up very close I've
 
01:57:54.790 --> 01:57:54.800 align:start position:0%
been visiting immigrants in ice custody
 
01:57:56.990 --> 01:57:57.000 align:start position:0%
at the straford county jail since
 
01:58:00.069 --> 01:58:00.079 align:start position:0%
2014 I have met fathers and mothers who
 
01:58:03.350 --> 01:58:03.360 align:start position:0%
are being torn from their families um in
 
01:58:05.910 --> 01:58:05.920 align:start position:0%
the events triggered by driving without
 
01:58:08.950 --> 01:58:08.960 align:start position:0%
a license I met last year a man a
 
01:58:11.709 --> 01:58:11.719 align:start position:0%
beloved uh multi- decades resident of a
 
01:58:13.910 --> 01:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
small New Hampshire town who every year
 
01:58:16.870 --> 01:58:16.880 align:start position:0%
was the clown in their fourth of July
 
01:58:19.830 --> 01:58:19.840 align:start position:0%
parade and now his US citizen wife and
 
01:58:23.069 --> 01:58:23.079 align:start position:0%
children are separated from him because
 
01:58:25.589 --> 01:58:25.599 align:start position:0%
he was uh caught driving without a
 
01:58:28.550 --> 01:58:28.560 align:start position:0%
license all of that stress separation
 
01:58:31.510 --> 01:58:31.520 align:start position:0%
and Trauma is avoidable so please vote
 
01:58:34.629 --> 01:58:34.639 align:start position:0%
in favor of this Common Sense provision
 
01:58:37.270 --> 01:58:37.280 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very
 
01:58:40.350 --> 01:58:40.360 align:start position:0%

hello and thank you to the committee for
 
01:59:23.470 --> 01:59:23.480 align:start position:0%
giving me the opportunity to speak my
 
01:59:25.430 --> 01:59:25.440 align:start position:0%
name is Grace K I am the program
 
01:59:26.830 --> 01:59:26.840 align:start position:0%
coordinator with the American friend
 
01:59:29.270 --> 01:59:29.280 align:start position:0%
service committee and I am from the man
 
01:59:30.790 --> 01:59:30.800 align:start position:0%
I am from Manchester and have lived the
 
01:59:32.790 --> 01:59:32.800 align:start position:0%
majority of my life in the granite state
 
01:59:34.910 --> 01:59:34.920 align:start position:0%
after immigrating here as a toddler in
 
01:59:37.430 --> 01:59:37.440 align:start position:0%
1989 I know firsthand what it's like to
 
01:59:39.629 --> 01:59:39.639 align:start position:0%
live as both an undocumented immigrant
 
01:59:41.390 --> 01:59:41.400 align:start position:0%
and as a documented one in the granite
 
01:59:44.990 --> 01:59:45.000 align:start position:0%
state I am here in support of hb3 328
 
01:59:47.270 --> 01:59:47.280 align:start position:0%
and urge the committee to pass this bill
 
01:59:49.589 --> 01:59:49.599 align:start position:0%
it is nearly impossible to live work
 
01:59:51.270 --> 01:59:51.280 align:start position:0%
shop or even go to school in New
 
01:59:53.069 --> 01:59:53.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire without access to a vehicle
 
01:59:55.229 --> 01:59:55.239 align:start position:0%
and I know that firsthand I was in high
 
01:59:56.149 --> 01:59:56.159 align:start position:0%
school when I learned that I was
 
01:59:57.910 --> 01:59:57.920 align:start position:0%
undocumented and joined a community of
 
01:59:59.950 --> 01:59:59.960 align:start position:0%
people who are often an overlooked but
 
02:00:01.709 --> 02:00:01.719 align:start position:0%
indelible part of the fabric of the
 
02:00:03.950 --> 02:00:03.960 align:start position:0%
state undocumented people residing in
 
02:00:06.750 --> 02:00:06.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire are about 14,000 14 17,000
 
02:00:09.390 --> 02:00:09.400 align:start position:0%
people as my other supporters have also
 
02:00:11.310 --> 02:00:11.320 align:start position:0%
stated we are contributing members of
 
02:00:13.470 --> 02:00:13.480 align:start position:0%
the state's economy and quality of life
 
02:00:15.709 --> 02:00:15.719 align:start position:0%
and we are your friends your family
 
02:00:18.589 --> 02:00:18.599 align:start position:0%
neighbors and loved ones not being able
 
02:00:20.750 --> 02:00:20.760 align:start position:0%
to drive that even as I like so many of
 
02:00:22.510 --> 02:00:22.520 align:start position:0%
my peers and my friends work to
 
02:00:23.870 --> 02:00:23.880 align:start position:0%
contribute to my family and get my
 
02:00:25.950 --> 02:00:25.960 align:start position:0%
education I had to do so without a
 
02:00:27.950 --> 02:00:27.960 align:start position:0%
license in a state with almost no public
 
02:00:30.069 --> 02:00:30.079 align:start position:0%
transportation system living in
 
02:00:31.910 --> 02:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
Manchester which probably has maybe the
 
02:00:35.149 --> 02:00:35.159 align:start position:0%
more robust uh local bus system local
 
02:00:37.790 --> 02:00:37.800 align:start position:0%
buses only ran once an hour and there is
 
02:00:39.950 --> 02:00:39.960 align:start position:0%
no efficient way to travel between towns
 
02:00:42.270 --> 02:00:42.280 align:start position:0%
and cities unless you have a car so
 
02:00:44.270 --> 02:00:44.280 align:start position:0%
people drive because they need to drive
 
02:00:45.830 --> 02:00:45.840 align:start position:0%
but driving as an immigrant as you've
 
02:00:47.669 --> 02:00:47.679 align:start position:0%
heard comes with the particular danger
 
02:00:49.390 --> 02:00:49.400 align:start position:0%
of becoming criminalized for simp simply
 
02:00:51.669 --> 02:00:51.679 align:start position:0%
doing what we can to work care for our
 
02:00:52.910 --> 02:00:52.920 align:start position:0%
families and contribute to our
 
02:00:55.430 --> 02:00:55.440 align:start position:0%
communities there is no need for this
 
02:00:57.149 --> 02:00:57.159 align:start position:0%
often the only crime is driving without
 
02:00:59.069 --> 02:00:59.079 align:start position:0%
a license and this bill would change
 
02:01:01.109 --> 02:01:01.119 align:start position:0%
that this bill would enable people to
 
02:01:03.189 --> 02:01:03.199 align:start position:0%
drive and also make our roadways and our
 
02:01:05.510 --> 02:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
community safer I urge the committee to
 
02:01:07.189 --> 02:01:07.199 align:start position:0%
vote a to pass on this bill which will
 
02:01:09.069 --> 02:01:09.079 align:start position:0%
go a long way to making New Hampshire a
 
02:01:11.109 --> 02:01:11.119 align:start position:0%
much safer place to live and work for
 
02:01:13.229 --> 02:01:13.239 align:start position:0%

am also a the chair of psychology at
 
02:02:03.430 --> 02:02:03.440 align:start position:0%
Keen State College where I'm sitting in
 
02:02:06.669 --> 02:02:06.679 align:start position:0%
my office right now and I just wanted to
 
02:02:10.270 --> 02:02:10.280 align:start position:0%
uh give a case example of that
 
02:02:14.510 --> 02:02:14.520 align:start position:0%
exemplifies why I support this bill um
 
02:02:17.189 --> 02:02:17.199 align:start position:0%
we we bring at times staff or college
 
02:02:19.430 --> 02:02:19.440 align:start position:0%
professors or students from from other
 
02:02:22.390 --> 02:02:22.400 align:start position:0%
countries too Keen to work here or to be
 
02:02:24.270 --> 02:02:24.280 align:start position:0%
students and they have to go through
 
02:02:27.390 --> 02:02:27.400 align:start position:0%
this strange and arduous process to uh
 
02:02:30.149 --> 02:02:30.159 align:start position:0%
to work here and and sometimes they move
 
02:02:30.159 --> 02:02:31.149 align:start position:0%
to work here and and sometimes they move
towards

02:02:31.149 --> 02:02:31.159 align:start position:0%
towards
 
02:02:33.709 --> 02:02:33.719 align:start position:0%
citizenship um at times when we when we
 
02:02:36.350 --> 02:02:36.360 align:start position:0%
use the term non-documented at times
 
02:02:40.470 --> 02:02:40.480 align:start position:0%
certain visas or permits lapse and
 
02:02:43.830 --> 02:02:43.840 align:start position:0%
there's certain periods of time before
 
02:02:46.589 --> 02:02:46.599 align:start position:0%
they're able to secure the next level
 
02:02:49.109 --> 02:02:49.119 align:start position:0%
documentation and that's often why they
 
02:02:51.550 --> 02:02:51.560 align:start position:0%
called non-documented even though
 
02:02:53.830 --> 02:02:53.840 align:start position:0%
they're moving through a legal process
 
02:02:56.470 --> 02:02:56.480 align:start position:0%
that's on the table and uh just this
 
02:02:58.149 --> 02:02:58.159 align:start position:0%
morning I was talking to a professor
 
02:02:59.709 --> 02:02:59.719 align:start position:0%
here who came from
 
02:03:03.510 --> 02:03:03.520 align:start position:0%
Ireland and he uh went through a similar
 
02:03:06.149 --> 02:03:06.159 align:start position:0%
period where he was quote non-documented
 
02:03:09.030 --> 02:03:09.040 align:start position:0%
he was unable to get a driver's license
 
02:03:11.750 --> 02:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
and during that time he fell at his home
 
02:03:14.189 --> 02:03:14.199 align:start position:0%
and he had a head injury and he was
 
02:03:15.550 --> 02:03:15.560 align:start position:0%
confused didn't know what to do he
 
02:03:17.470 --> 02:03:17.480 align:start position:0%
didn't have a proper driver's license he
 
02:03:19.709 --> 02:03:19.719 align:start position:0%
didn't want to put himself at risk
 
02:03:21.709 --> 02:03:21.719 align:start position:0%
for being sent back and losing his job
 
02:03:24.790 --> 02:03:24.800 align:start position:0%
here at Keen State College so he um
 
02:03:27.189 --> 02:03:27.199 align:start position:0%
actually got a neighbor to drive him to
 
02:03:30.109 --> 02:03:30.119 align:start position:0%
the ER to take care of his head injury
 
02:03:33.430 --> 02:03:33.440 align:start position:0%
so it's this sort of thing that is you
 
02:03:36.950 --> 02:03:36.960 align:start position:0%
know just is a problem for us as people
 
02:03:40.430 --> 02:03:40.440 align:start position:0%
go through these periods of time between
 
02:03:42.430 --> 02:03:42.440 align:start position:0%
documentation even though they're on a
 
02:03:45.669 --> 02:03:45.679 align:start position:0%
legal process um we also have people who
 
02:03:49.430 --> 02:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
are seeking Asylum living a handful of
 
02:03:51.430 --> 02:03:51.440 align:start position:0%
people here in Kean New Hampshire they
 
02:03:53.470 --> 02:03:53.480 align:start position:0%
go through a period usually six months
 
02:03:55.990 --> 02:03:56.000 align:start position:0%
or longer where they are going through a
 
02:03:58.229 --> 02:03:58.239 align:start position:0%
legal process but they're not documented
 
02:04:00.790 --> 02:04:00.800 align:start position:0%
they're unable to get a driver's license
 
02:04:03.189 --> 02:04:03.199 align:start position:0%
and so we have to sort of get people in
 
02:04:05.030 --> 02:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
the community to drive them to their
 
02:04:07.950 --> 02:04:07.960 align:start position:0%
English as a second language class or to
 
02:04:10.189 --> 02:04:10.199 align:start position:0%
their internships at local farms where
 
02:04:12.549 --> 02:04:12.559 align:start position:0%
they're learning skills those sorts of
 
02:04:16.109 --> 02:04:16.119 align:start position:0%
things so for that reason just again uh
 
02:04:18.870 --> 02:04:18.880 align:start position:0%
like the the police chief said for
 
02:04:22.229 --> 02:04:22.239 align:start position:0%
Common Sense reasons um I'd urge you to
 
02:04:24.270 --> 02:04:24.280 align:start position:0%
support this Bill thank
 
02:04:28.589 --> 02:04:28.599 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much see no questions
 
02:04:30.350 --> 02:04:30.360 align:start position:0%
from the committee thank you
 
02:04:33.270 --> 02:04:33.280 align:start position:0%
again uh chair recognizes and I
 
02:04:37.549 --> 02:04:37.559 align:start position:0%
apologize also State Rep Maria
 
02:04:44.910 --> 02:04:44.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:47.870 --> 02:04:47.880 align:start position:0%
earlier thank you for the opportunity Mr
 
02:04:49.310 --> 02:04:49.320 align:start position:0%
Mr Sher
 
02:04:51.669 --> 02:04:51.679 align:start position:0%
um my name is Maria Perez I'm a state
 
02:04:54.669 --> 02:04:54.679 align:start position:0%
representative for district 23 Milford
 
02:04:58.390 --> 02:04:58.400 align:start position:0%
um I'm calling and support of this bill
 
02:05:00.030 --> 02:05:00.040 align:start position:0%
one of the reason that I support this
 
02:05:03.189 --> 02:05:03.199 align:start position:0%
bill is um I'm a Survivor of domestic
 
02:05:05.910 --> 02:05:05.920 align:start position:0%
violence and I heard some of the police
 
02:05:10.589 --> 02:05:10.599 align:start position:0%
officers say it if um someone who is a
 
02:05:13.510 --> 02:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
victim of domestic violence or any kind
 
02:05:16.549 --> 02:05:16.559 align:start position:0%
of violence uh if they have the
 
02:05:19.870 --> 02:05:19.880 align:start position:0%
confidence they can um go to the police
 
02:05:21.830 --> 02:05:21.840 align:start position:0%
and then told them exactly what they
 
02:05:25.990 --> 02:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
going through um they will do it and and
 
02:05:28.270 --> 02:05:28.280 align:start position:0%
I believe this bill would help to people
 
02:05:32.030 --> 02:05:32.040 align:start position:0%
to have that confidence and then um feel
 
02:05:34.750 --> 02:05:34.760 align:start position:0%
um more uh safe to go to the police
 
02:05:37.350 --> 02:05:37.360 align:start position:0%
department without being scared to get
 
02:05:39.430 --> 02:05:39.440 align:start position:0%
the Porter and the other thing that I
 
02:05:42.470 --> 02:05:42.480 align:start position:0%
want to say is a lot of these people
 
02:05:44.510 --> 02:05:44.520 align:start position:0%
they he there
 
02:05:47.750 --> 02:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
are members of our communities they have
 
02:05:51.830 --> 02:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
businesses who who are um employing some
 
02:05:55.109 --> 02:05:55.119 align:start position:0%
of our citizens and they pay taxes and
 
02:05:56.830 --> 02:05:56.840 align:start position:0%
then the other thing that I I want to
 
02:06:01.350 --> 02:06:01.360 align:start position:0%
say um is if we pass this bill um it's
 
02:06:03.189 --> 02:06:03.199 align:start position:0%
going to be revenue for our state and
 
02:06:05.790 --> 02:06:05.800 align:start position:0%
it's going to be revenue for of
 
02:06:08.270 --> 02:06:08.280 align:start position:0%
automobile insurance companies because
 
02:06:10.149 --> 02:06:10.159 align:start position:0%
you know these people if they have a
 
02:06:11.709 --> 02:06:11.719 align:start position:0%
driver's license they were GNA be able
 
02:06:14.310 --> 02:06:14.320 align:start position:0%
to buy a vehicle not using someone
 
02:06:17.310 --> 02:06:17.320 align:start position:0%
else's vehicle and that uh is going to
 
02:06:20.229 --> 02:06:20.239 align:start position:0%
be Revenue not just for the for for us
 
02:06:22.030 --> 02:06:22.040 align:start position:0%
as a state but it's going to be revenue
 
02:06:23.990 --> 02:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
for insurance
 
02:06:28.430 --> 02:06:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:32.109 --> 02:06:32.119 align:start position:0%
time see no questions thank you
 
02:06:34.669 --> 02:06:34.679 align:start position:0%

02:07:46.430 --> 02:07:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:49.350 --> 02:07:49.360 align:start position:0%
now good morning
 
02:07:51.669 --> 02:07:51.679 align:start position:0%
morning thank you Mr chair and members
 
02:07:53.790 --> 02:07:53.800 align:start position:0%
of the committee uh it's great to be
 
02:07:55.310 --> 02:07:55.320 align:start position:0%
with you a second time this morning my
 
02:07:56.669 --> 02:07:56.679 align:start position:0%
name is Jeanie hores and I'm the
 
02:07:58.069 --> 02:07:58.079 align:start position:0%
political director for the American
 
02:08:00.430 --> 02:08:00.440 align:start position:0%
civil liberties Union of New Hampshire
 
02:08:02.030 --> 02:08:02.040 align:start position:0%
it's actually really great to talk about
 
02:08:03.750 --> 02:08:03.760 align:start position:0%
this bill right after the last one
 
02:08:06.910 --> 02:08:06.920 align:start position:0%
because it it's not an unrelated theme
 
02:08:09.669 --> 02:08:09.679 align:start position:0%
which is the importance of driving in a
 
02:08:11.870 --> 02:08:11.880 align:start position:0%
state like New Hampshire that is so
 
02:08:14.549 --> 02:08:14.559 align:start position:0%
rural that to access anything from a job
 
02:08:16.430 --> 02:08:16.440 align:start position:0%
to medical care to even picking your
 
02:08:18.750 --> 02:08:18.760 align:start position:0%
kids up from school depend depends on
 
02:08:21.990 --> 02:08:22.000 align:start position:0%
one's ability to drive um and again not
 
02:08:24.069 --> 02:08:24.079 align:start position:0%
unlike the bill before we're talking
 
02:08:26.669 --> 02:08:26.679 align:start position:0%
about putting people in a situation
 
02:08:29.069 --> 02:08:29.079 align:start position:0%
where we actually risk criminalizing
 
02:08:31.870 --> 02:08:31.880 align:start position:0%
them for taking care of their family
 
02:08:33.709 --> 02:08:33.719 align:start position:0%
forcing people to drive without a
 
02:08:37.270 --> 02:08:37.280 align:start position:0%
license risk unnecessarily criminalizing
 
02:08:39.109 --> 02:08:39.119 align:start position:0%
them it is a crime to drive without a
 
02:08:40.910 --> 02:08:40.920 align:start position:0%
license in this state and in the absence
 
02:08:43.229 --> 02:08:43.239 align:start position:0%
of this legislation we will
 
02:08:45.470 --> 02:08:45.480 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily expend law enforcement and
 
02:08:47.910 --> 02:08:47.920 align:start position:0%
state resources on penalizing people who
 
02:08:50.030 --> 02:08:50.040 align:start position:0%
would read get a driver's license if
 
02:08:52.629 --> 02:08:52.639 align:start position:0%
they were allowed and I also I just want
 
02:08:55.109 --> 02:08:55.119 align:start position:0%
to underscore what some of the previous
 
02:08:57.470 --> 02:08:57.480 align:start position:0%
Witnesses said about the opportunity to
 
02:08:59.990 --> 02:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
reduce the fear that undocumented
 
02:09:02.149 --> 02:09:02.159 align:start position:0%
Granite Staters have towards law
 
02:09:04.870 --> 02:09:04.880 align:start position:0%
enforcement the ACLU actually released a
 
02:09:08.069 --> 02:09:08.079 align:start position:0%
report in 2018 about the very real fears
 
02:09:10.510 --> 02:09:10.520 align:start position:0%
the immigrants have of law enforcement
 
02:09:12.350 --> 02:09:12.360 align:start position:0%
particularly due to the fear of being
 
02:09:14.790 --> 02:09:14.800 align:start position:0%
deported and this fear has real life
 
02:09:16.589 --> 02:09:16.599 align:start position:0%
implications including deterring
 
02:09:18.549 --> 02:09:18.559 align:start position:0%
immigrants from cooperating with law
 
02:09:20.629 --> 02:09:20.639 align:start position:0%
enforcement or even calling law
 
02:09:23.030 --> 02:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
enforcement in the event of an
 
02:09:25.669 --> 02:09:25.679 align:start position:0%
emergency Daily Report noted that quote
 
02:09:27.830 --> 02:09:27.840 align:start position:0%
fear of deportation is stopping
 
02:09:30.069 --> 02:09:30.079 align:start position:0%
immigrants from reporting crimes and
 
02:09:32.790 --> 02:09:32.800 align:start position:0%
participating in court proceedings I
 
02:09:34.390 --> 02:09:34.400 align:start position:0%
think we all know that the most common
 
02:09:36.830 --> 02:09:36.840 align:start position:0%
interaction with law enforcement is is
 
02:09:39.750 --> 02:09:39.760 align:start position:0%
in motor vehicle context so if we
 
02:09:42.629 --> 02:09:42.639 align:start position:0%
provide access to Driver's Licenses to
 
02:09:44.750 --> 02:09:44.760 align:start position:0%
undocumented Granite Staters we really
 
02:09:46.990 --> 02:09:47.000 align:start position:0%
do believe this would reduce the fear
 
02:09:48.830 --> 02:09:48.840 align:start position:0%
that they have towards police polias and
 
02:09:51.669 --> 02:09:51.679 align:start position:0%
could enable cooperation it would allow
 
02:09:54.629 --> 02:09:54.639 align:start position:0%
undocumented Granite Staters um to have
 
02:09:56.350 --> 02:09:56.360 align:start position:0%
more faith in interacting with law
 
02:09:58.030 --> 02:09:58.040 align:start position:0%
enforcement they may call them more in
 
02:10:00.910 --> 02:10:00.920 align:start position:0%
times of emergency um and we could
 
02:10:03.950 --> 02:10:03.960 align:start position:0%
really build community uh collaboration
 
02:10:07.350 --> 02:10:07.360 align:start position:0%
and Trust in those instances um so I
 
02:10:09.069 --> 02:10:09.079 align:start position:0%
thank you for your consideration of this
 
02:10:10.990 --> 02:10:11.000 align:start position:0%

the my the previous statements um so I
 
02:12:24.950 --> 02:12:24.960 align:start position:0%
want just to concentrate on the medical
 
02:12:27.229 --> 02:12:27.239 align:start position:0%
related issues associated with the
 
02:12:30.390 --> 02:12:30.400 align:start position:0%
benefits of having a driver license
 
02:12:32.750 --> 02:12:32.760 align:start position:0%
especially if we consider that many
 
02:12:36.430 --> 02:12:36.440 align:start position:0%
estate residents cannot so far now they
 
02:12:39.669 --> 02:12:39.679 align:start position:0%
cannot have a driver license but they
 
02:12:39.679 --> 02:12:40.549 align:start position:0%
cannot have a driver license but they
are

02:12:40.549 --> 02:12:40.559 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:12:43.430 --> 02:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
forcer to
 
02:12:45.830 --> 02:12:45.840 align:start position:0%
drive dealing with an unconscious
 
02:12:48.149 --> 02:12:48.159 align:start position:0%
patients in a hospital environment can
 
02:12:51.589 --> 02:12:51.599 align:start position:0%
be a dangerous event identifying unnown
 
02:12:54.310 --> 02:12:54.320 align:start position:0%
emergency room patients usually involves
 
02:12:57.390 --> 02:12:57.400 align:start position:0%
assigning the patient an identification
 
02:13:00.390 --> 02:13:00.400 align:start position:0%
tag with a hospital number or medical
 
02:13:04.069 --> 02:13:04.079 align:start position:0%
record number still the risk of treating
 
02:13:07.350 --> 02:13:07.360 align:start position:0%
a patient with no identification rise in
 
02:13:10.030 --> 02:13:10.040 align:start position:0%
the absence of any formal identification
 
02:13:12.950 --> 02:13:12.960 align:start position:0%
credentials like is a driver license
 
02:13:15.669 --> 02:13:15.679 align:start position:0%
unanswered questions about their past
 
02:13:18.510 --> 02:13:18.520 align:start position:0%

02:13:21.430 --> 02:13:21.440 align:start position:0%

02:13:23.430 --> 02:13:23.440 align:start position:0%
patient
 
02:13:26.950 --> 02:13:26.960 align:start position:0%
safety the pharmacy um the pharmacy
 
02:13:29.750 --> 02:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
require patient
 
02:13:32.189 --> 02:13:32.199 align:start position:0%
identification uh before dispensing a
 
02:13:34.870 --> 02:13:34.880 align:start position:0%
controlled substance prescription a
 
02:13:38.629 --> 02:13:38.639 align:start position:0%
foreign passport or consulate ID card is
 
02:13:41.589 --> 02:13:41.599 align:start position:0%
acceptable but um as several times the
 
02:13:44.669 --> 02:13:44.679 align:start position:0%
farm their Pharmacy put to the the
 
02:13:47.549 --> 02:13:47.559 align:start position:0%
trouble uh the patients to asset foreign
 
02:13:49.350 --> 02:13:49.360 align:start position:0%
documents ments like
 
02:13:51.870 --> 02:13:51.880 align:start position:0%
identification um this is especially
 
02:13:54.229 --> 02:13:54.239 align:start position:0%
challenging when the patient does not
 
02:13:58.069 --> 02:13:58.079 align:start position:0%
have enough English to advocate for
 
02:14:00.830 --> 02:14:00.840 align:start position:0%
themselves and I know this because I had
 
02:14:04.790 --> 02:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
to help several times in cases like like
 
02:14:07.790 --> 02:14:07.800 align:start position:0%
this where I could help still the
 
02:14:10.589 --> 02:14:10.599 align:start position:0%
medication was given reluctantly by the
 
02:14:10.599 --> 02:14:12.149 align:start position:0%
medication was given reluctantly by the
pharmacy

02:14:12.149 --> 02:14:12.159 align:start position:0%
pharmacy
 
02:14:15.669 --> 02:14:15.679 align:start position:0%
personel by registering to be an organ
 
02:14:18.390 --> 02:14:18.400 align:start position:0%
and tissue donor in a driver license
 
02:14:21.270 --> 02:14:21.280 align:start position:0%
more people of all ages can
 
02:14:24.510 --> 02:14:24.520 align:start position:0%
donate um we need to consider that many
 
02:14:27.990 --> 02:14:28.000 align:start position:0%
more donors are needed accordingly to
 
02:14:30.229 --> 02:14:30.239 align:start position:0%
the United States Department of Health
 
02:14:33.589 --> 02:14:33.599 align:start position:0%
and Human Services fewer than 2% of
 
02:14:36.510 --> 02:14:36.520 align:start position:0%
registered donors are actually in a
 
02:14:38.189 --> 02:14:38.199 align:start position:0%
position to Save a

Life B an organ donor registered in the
 
02:14:44.310 --> 02:14:44.320 align:start position:0%
license is one of the greatest things we
 
02:14:48.189 --> 02:14:48.199 align:start position:0%
can do we can improve and even save save
 
02:14:51.790 --> 02:14:51.800 align:start position:0%
many people lives one organ and and
 
02:14:54.629 --> 02:14:54.639 align:start position:0%
tissue donor can save the lives of up to
 
02:14:57.709 --> 02:14:57.719 align:start position:0%
eight people and enhance lives of so
 
02:15:01.069 --> 02:15:01.079 align:start position:0%
many through Tio donation a donor can
 
02:15:04.350 --> 02:15:04.360 align:start position:0%
enhance countless others lives through
 
02:15:07.790 --> 02:15:07.800 align:start position:0%
bone donations for repair fractures and
 
02:15:10.629 --> 02:15:10.639 align:start position:0%
prevent amputations and skin donations
 
02:15:13.990 --> 02:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
to heal burn patients donors can also
 
02:15:16.589 --> 02:15:16.599 align:start position:0%
donate their corneas giving the gift of
 
02:15:19.109 --> 02:15:19.119 align:start position:0%
sight to receive
 
02:15:21.750 --> 02:15:21.760 align:start position:0%
if a patient has a driver license
 
02:15:24.589 --> 02:15:24.599 align:start position:0%
Physicians have a way to inform the the
 
02:15:28.149 --> 02:15:28.159 align:start position:0%
DMV when they diagnose a patient with
 
02:15:30.629 --> 02:15:30.639 align:start position:0%
any medical condition that may affect
 
02:15:34.270 --> 02:15:34.280 align:start position:0%
the person ability to drive safely and
 
02:15:36.669 --> 02:15:36.679 align:start position:0%
also the driver license indicates if
 
02:15:39.990 --> 02:15:40.000 align:start position:0%

up thank you I apologize thank you for
 
02:16:16.149 --> 02:16:16.159 align:start position:0%
taking my question um would you say that
 
02:16:19.589 --> 02:16:19.599 align:start position:0%
um undocumented persons who don't have
 
02:16:21.350 --> 02:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
the ability to drive are going to make
 
02:16:23.390 --> 02:16:23.400 align:start position:0%
certain choices about their health care
 
02:16:26.549 --> 02:16:26.559 align:start position:0%
because they either can't get to
 
02:16:29.270 --> 02:16:29.280 align:start position:0%
appropriate medical care or for fear of
 
02:16:31.030 --> 02:16:31.040 align:start position:0%
having to turn over a license for
 
02:16:34.669 --> 02:16:34.679 align:start position:0%
identification at the physician's place
 
02:16:38.270 --> 02:16:38.280 align:start position:0%
yes there is a this is one this is one
 
02:16:41.349 --> 02:16:41.359 align:start position:0%
reason so many many many people who
 
02:16:44.709 --> 02:16:44.719 align:start position:0%
isn't documented they end going to
 
02:16:46.309 --> 02:16:46.319 align:start position:0%
waiting to go to the emergency room
 
02:16:48.469 --> 02:16:48.479 align:start position:0%
there is a combination of two things one
 
02:16:52.030 --> 02:16:52.040 align:start position:0%
is the uh the not access to to to to
 
02:16:54.110 --> 02:16:54.120 align:start position:0%
health insurance is one problem and the
 
02:16:56.910 --> 02:16:56.920 align:start position:0%
other problem is the identification also
 
02:17:00.830 --> 02:17:00.840 align:start position:0%
to call Emergency Services they they are
 
02:17:03.629 --> 02:17:03.639 align:start position:0%
afraid that uh when they call the
 
02:17:06.549 --> 02:17:06.559 align:start position:0%
ambulas for example this their situation
 
02:17:09.030 --> 02:17:09.040 align:start position:0%
or their that could be discovered and
 
02:17:11.990 --> 02:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
they are undocumented and that could be
 
02:17:14.910 --> 02:17:14.920 align:start position:0%
landing that information on immigration
 
02:17:18.589 --> 02:17:18.599 align:start position:0%
and force personel um there is
 
02:17:22.589 --> 02:17:22.599 align:start position:0%
and and and there is an issue also and
 
02:17:25.709 --> 02:17:25.719 align:start position:0%
with there is the lack of um of of
 
02:17:28.150 --> 02:17:28.160 align:start position:0%
driver license is in for example is in
 
02:17:30.389 --> 02:17:30.399 align:start position:0%
an accident sometimes there is people
 
02:17:32.509 --> 02:17:32.519 align:start position:0%
that should go to the hospital and
 
02:17:34.669 --> 02:17:34.679 align:start position:0%
sometimes the ambulance recommend them
 
02:17:37.629 --> 02:17:37.639 align:start position:0%
to go to the hospital and they they said
 
02:17:39.990 --> 02:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
no they don't want they don't want to
 
02:17:42.709 --> 02:17:42.719 align:start position:0%
they don't want to go because they are
 
02:17:44.830 --> 02:17:44.840 align:start position:0%
afraid or something could happen even
 
02:17:46.830 --> 02:17:46.840 align:start position:0%
sometimes people that they are not we're
 
02:17:48.870 --> 02:17:48.880 align:start position:0%
not the people that were driving where
 
02:17:51.790 --> 02:17:51.800 align:start position:0%
people than they just want there in the
 
02:17:55.589 --> 02:17:55.599 align:start position:0%
car I don't know if that your question
 
02:17:55.599 --> 02:17:56.309 align:start position:0%

Manchester uh I concur with every single
 
02:19:01.309 --> 02:19:01.319 align:start position:0%
word my predecessors have said so I'm
 
02:19:05.190 --> 02:19:05.200 align:start position:0%
not going to to repeat that the fact is
 
02:19:07.790 --> 02:19:07.800 align:start position:0%
that this is a practical matter we have
 
02:19:11.830 --> 02:19:11.840 align:start position:0%
people on the road driving right now and
 
02:19:14.950 --> 02:19:14.960 align:start position:0%
this is not only going to benefit those
 
02:19:18.070 --> 02:19:18.080 align:start position:0%
people it's going to make us safer as a
 
02:19:20.790 --> 02:19:20.800 align:start position:0%
state as a community so this is this
 
02:19:24.389 --> 02:19:24.399 align:start position:0%
will benefit every single one of us I
 
02:19:27.830 --> 02:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
have worked in Manchester and in all the
 
02:19:29.870 --> 02:19:29.880 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire with undocumented
 
02:19:34.150 --> 02:19:34.160 align:start position:0%
for over 30 years I I'm also a police
 
02:19:36.389 --> 02:19:36.399 align:start position:0%
commissioner in Manchester this is my
 
02:19:40.150 --> 02:19:40.160 align:start position:0%
third term uh I'm not speaking for the
 
02:19:43.309 --> 02:19:43.319 align:start position:0%
commission but part of my role has
 
02:19:46.429 --> 02:19:46.439 align:start position:0%
always been to make sure that our
 
02:19:46.439 --> 02:19:48.030 align:start position:0%
always been to make sure that our
community

02:19:48.030 --> 02:19:48.040 align:start position:0%
community
 
02:19:52.550 --> 02:19:52.560 align:start position:0%
trusts the police and I can vouch for
 
02:19:54.990 --> 02:19:55.000 align:start position:0%
that fear that immigrants have of the
 
02:19:57.429 --> 02:19:57.439 align:start position:0%
police because of the experiences that
 
02:20:00.429 --> 02:20:00.439 align:start position:0%
we've had in our countries uh our police
 
02:20:02.990 --> 02:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
officers in our countries are pretty
 
02:20:05.750 --> 02:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
corrupt and bad and we have that in our
 
02:20:08.590 --> 02:20:08.600 align:start position:0%
hard disk if you will so we come here
 
02:20:10.429 --> 02:20:10.439 align:start position:0%
and in addition to that we have the
 
02:20:13.309 --> 02:20:13.319 align:start position:0%
immigration status and uh there is
 
02:20:16.270 --> 02:20:16.280 align:start position:0%
plenty of reasons to fear and many times
 
02:20:18.670 --> 02:20:18.680 align:start position:0%
I have had to really talk to my
 
02:20:21.150 --> 02:20:21.160 align:start position:0%
communities and make and convince them
 
02:20:23.990 --> 02:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
to go report crimes or they don't feel
 
02:20:27.270 --> 02:20:27.280 align:start position:0%
safe reporting crimes or fear of of
 
02:20:30.870 --> 02:20:30.880 align:start position:0%
immigration and for lack of having a a
 
02:20:33.349 --> 02:20:33.359 align:start position:0%
some type of identification people are
 
02:20:35.870 --> 02:20:35.880 align:start position:0%
going to continue driving given what you
 
02:20:38.389 --> 02:20:38.399 align:start position:0%
heard the the public transportation
 
02:20:42.670 --> 02:20:42.680 align:start position:0%
system here how limited it is and this
 
02:20:45.510 --> 02:20:45.520 align:start position:0%
you know many times people can most of
 
02:20:47.830 --> 02:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
the time people cannot re uh
 
02:20:50.630 --> 02:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
do register their cars in their names
 
02:20:52.190 --> 02:20:52.200 align:start position:0%
because they don't have a driver's
 
02:20:54.550 --> 02:20:54.560 align:start position:0%
license so so a third party ends up
 
02:20:56.469 --> 02:20:56.479 align:start position:0%
registering the cars for some
 
02:20:58.830 --> 02:20:58.840 align:start position:0%
undocumented person so that LS itself
 
02:21:01.469 --> 02:21:01.479 align:start position:0%
for a total mess the police officers
 
02:21:03.469 --> 02:21:03.479 align:start position:0%
never know who they're dealing with they
 
02:21:06.070 --> 02:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
don't know who owns the cars they that
 
02:21:09.070 --> 02:21:09.080 align:start position:0%
there's a a big web of stuff that could
 
02:21:13.349 --> 02:21:13.359 align:start position:0%
just be resolved if we just allow the
 
02:21:17.469 --> 02:21:17.479 align:start position:0%
people to to uh be who they are and and
 
02:21:19.790 --> 02:21:19.800 align:start position:0%
and to have some type of identification
 
02:21:22.190 --> 02:21:22.200 align:start position:0%
and H and know the rules of the road and
 
02:21:24.349 --> 02:21:24.359 align:start position:0%
make sure that everybody can be held
 
02:21:27.750 --> 02:21:27.760 align:start position:0%
accountable if they fail so for all of
 
02:21:32.870 --> 02:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
this uh I just urge you to please uh
 
02:21:36.429 --> 02:21:36.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:40.309 --> 02:21:40.319 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you very much thank
 
02:21:42.510 --> 02:21:42.520 align:start position:0%
you for the statement made about the
 
02:21:44.950 --> 02:21:44.960 align:start position:0%
police before uh we're not going to be
 
02:21:48.950 --> 02:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
offering any questions chair
 
02:21:59.389 --> 02:21:59.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:03.950 --> 02:22:03.960 align:start position:0%
bill hi um my name is uh is actually
 
02:22:07.030 --> 02:22:07.040 align:start position:0%
Bill plug um but it's a tough name it's
 
02:22:09.630 --> 02:22:09.640 align:start position:0%
a tough name to pronounce uh thank you
 
02:22:12.030 --> 02:22:12.040 align:start position:0%
so much for giving me this
 
02:22:15.150 --> 02:22:15.160 align:start position:0%
opportunity coming towards the end here
 
02:22:17.990 --> 02:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
I I I'm not going to repeat anything
 
02:22:21.110 --> 02:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
that anyone has said what I I'd like to
 
02:22:25.110 --> 02:22:25.120 align:start position:0%
do is amplify the situation that an
 
02:22:28.950 --> 02:22:28.960 align:start position:0%
asylum Seeker experience is here in New
 
02:22:32.110 --> 02:22:32.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I I work with several Asylum
 
02:22:34.309 --> 02:22:34.319 align:start position:0%
support groups in the state including
 
02:22:36.750 --> 02:22:36.760 align:start position:0%
one here in the Upper Valley uper upper
 
02:22:40.750 --> 02:22:40.760 align:start position:0%
Connecticut Valley and um the situation
 
02:22:43.030 --> 02:22:43.040 align:start position:0%
is much as what uh representative
 
02:22:46.710 --> 02:22:46.720 align:start position:0%
welkowitz uh discussed they come here
 
02:22:49.910 --> 02:22:49.920 align:start position:0%
they need need to um they come here with
 
02:22:53.309 --> 02:22:53.319 align:start position:0%
legal a certain kind of legal status
 
02:22:57.270 --> 02:22:57.280 align:start position:0%
often um their first task is to file an
 
02:23:01.870 --> 02:23:01.880 align:start position:0%
asylum claim and then once they uh file
 
02:23:06.349 --> 02:23:06.359 align:start position:0%
an asylum claim they are eligible to
 
02:23:08.550 --> 02:23:08.560 align:start position:0%
apply for work
 
02:23:11.630 --> 02:23:11.640 align:start position:0%
authorization once they get work
 
02:23:14.510 --> 02:23:14.520 align:start position:0%
authorization there they get uh the
 
02:23:17.790 --> 02:23:17.800 align:start position:0%
ability to apply for soci security
 
02:23:20.870 --> 02:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
number and then only then with the
 
02:23:23.710 --> 02:23:23.720 align:start position:0%
social security number are they eligible
 
02:23:26.070 --> 02:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
to apply for a
 
02:23:31.110 --> 02:23:31.120 align:start position:0%
license so right now the period of time
 
02:23:34.590 --> 02:23:34.600 align:start position:0%
that that can take between arrival here
 
02:23:37.309 --> 02:23:37.319 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and the legal
 
02:23:41.590 --> 02:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity to apply for a license is at
 
02:23:46.510 --> 02:23:46.520 align:start position:0%
a minimum a year so they're here without
 
02:23:49.469 --> 02:23:49.479 align:start position:0%
that ability ability to drive for at
 
02:23:52.990 --> 02:23:53.000 align:start position:0%
least a year uh and for all the reasons
 
02:23:57.070 --> 02:23:57.080 align:start position:0%
given that's a very difficult situation
 
02:24:02.309 --> 02:24:02.319 align:start position:0%
to be in in New Hampshire and um a a a
 
02:24:04.710 --> 02:24:04.720 align:start position:0%
product of this bill would be that
 
02:24:08.630 --> 02:24:08.640 align:start position:0%
they'd be able to apply earlier for a
 
02:24:11.510 --> 02:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
driver's license so I'll end right with
 
02:24:14.309 --> 02:24:14.319 align:start position:0%
that point and I'm happy to take any
 
02:24:19.110 --> 02:24:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:22.030 --> 02:24:22.040 align:start position:0%
I do see a couple of questions
 
02:24:24.150 --> 02:24:24.160 align:start position:0%
representative uh thank you Mr chairman
 
02:24:27.150 --> 02:24:27.160 align:start position:0%
my my um it's not really a question it's
 
02:24:28.950 --> 02:24:28.960 align:start position:0%
just uh something for you I think you
 
02:24:30.070 --> 02:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
might have misunderstood what the
 
02:24:31.710 --> 02:24:31.720 align:start position:0%
previous witness was saying about the
 
02:24:33.870 --> 02:24:33.880 align:start position:0%
police she was trying to say that police
 
02:24:35.190 --> 02:24:35.200 align:start position:0%
in their home countries are often
 
02:24:37.550 --> 02:24:37.560 align:start position:0%
corrupt so they tend to fear police in
 
02:24:38.830 --> 02:24:38.840 align:start position:0%
general I don't think she was making a
 
02:24:41.550 --> 02:24:41.560 align:start position:0%
statement about American police or our
 
02:24:43.349 --> 02:24:43.359 align:start position:0%
uh criminal justice system or anything
 
02:24:44.349 --> 02:24:44.359 align:start position:0%
like that
 
02:24:46.710 --> 02:24:46.720 align:start position:0%
so that's not how it was heard but even
 
02:24:49.230 --> 02:24:49.240 align:start position:0%
so so I did not stop her from speaking
 
02:24:52.269 --> 02:24:52.279 align:start position:0%
right let her finish that that's what I
 
02:24:54.950 --> 02:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
understood when she talked about that so
 
02:24:56.429 --> 02:24:56.439 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding but that's not how I
 
02:24:59.790 --> 02:24:59.800 align:start position:0%
took it representa pleer yes thank you
 
02:25:01.750 --> 02:25:01.760 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you Mr
 
02:25:05.030 --> 02:25:05.040 align:start position:0%
PL uh in in your
 
02:25:08.550 --> 02:25:08.560 align:start position:0%
experience typically someone goes to the
 
02:25:11.910 --> 02:25:11.920 align:start position:0%
position they have to show ID and and
 
02:25:15.469 --> 02:25:15.479 align:start position:0%
insurance and so on uh and normally that
 
02:25:17.469 --> 02:25:17.479 align:start position:0%
would be a driver's license in your
 
02:25:20.389 --> 02:25:20.399 align:start position:0%
experience how do those that do not have
 
02:25:23.389 --> 02:25:23.399 align:start position:0%
a license show ID when they
 
02:25:26.230 --> 02:25:26.240 align:start position:0%
go for medical appointment in in
 
02:25:29.670 --> 02:25:29.680 align:start position:0%
particular um so so they do have some uh
 
02:25:29.680 --> 02:25:30.590 align:start position:0%
particular um so so they do have some uh
a

02:25:30.590 --> 02:25:30.600 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:25:33.910 --> 02:25:33.920 align:start position:0%
permission from um you know they've been
 
02:25:36.670 --> 02:25:36.680 align:start position:0%
released into this country uh they've
 
02:25:40.070 --> 02:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
passed a credible fear interview and
 
02:25:45.150 --> 02:25:45.160 align:start position:0%
they've been released to a uh uh to to
 
02:25:47.710 --> 02:25:47.720 align:start position:0%
to travel to the inside the United
 
02:25:52.190 --> 02:25:52.200 align:start position:0%
States so they have that um in that that
 
02:25:55.469 --> 02:25:55.479 align:start position:0%
sort of uh legal permission and other
 
02:25:57.950 --> 02:25:57.960 align:start position:0%
than that I I I can't I can't answer
 
02:26:00.910 --> 02:26:00.920 align:start position:0%
what they use to identify themselves um
 
02:26:04.469 --> 02:26:04.479 align:start position:0%
they may have um identification from
 
02:26:08.389 --> 02:26:08.399 align:start position:0%
their home country but other than that
 
02:26:11.309 --> 02:26:11.319 align:start position:0%

02:26:11.319 --> 02:26:12.830 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure what they use to
identify

02:26:12.830 --> 02:26:12.840 align:start position:0%

02:28:46.870 --> 02:28:46.880 align:start position:0%
I'm here to express our support for HB
 
02:28:50.950 --> 02:28:50.960 align:start position:0%
uh 3 3 to8 um most of our work at the
 
02:28:53.110 --> 02:28:53.120 align:start position:0%
Grand State organizing project involves
 
02:28:55.710 --> 02:28:55.720 align:start position:0%
working with immigrants we encounter uh
 
02:28:57.630 --> 02:28:57.640 align:start position:0%
undocumented immigrants every day in the
 
02:29:00.269 --> 02:29:00.279 align:start position:0%
work that we do and this bill would
 
02:29:03.110 --> 02:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
benefit so many individuals an example
 
02:29:04.990 --> 02:29:05.000 align:start position:0%
is someone that I know personally who
 
02:29:06.750 --> 02:29:06.760 align:start position:0%
has been in this country for over 20
 
02:29:09.910 --> 02:29:09.920 align:start position:0%
years she works as a home care Aid
 
02:29:12.030 --> 02:29:12.040 align:start position:0%
taking care of the elderly she pays
 
02:29:14.750 --> 02:29:14.760 align:start position:0%
taxes using her individual tax
 
02:29:17.190 --> 02:29:17.200 align:start position:0%
identification number but one of the
 
02:29:20.710 --> 02:29:20.720 align:start position:0%
obstacles uh to her work is that what
 
02:29:22.750 --> 02:29:22.760 align:start position:0%
what she does and where she goes is is
 
02:29:25.110 --> 02:29:25.120 align:start position:0%
dependent on the transportation she has
 
02:29:28.389 --> 02:29:28.399 align:start position:0%
to rely on friends for rights sometimes
 
02:29:30.389 --> 02:29:30.399 align:start position:0%
she has to walk if the bus isn't
 
02:29:32.750 --> 02:29:32.760 align:start position:0%
available she's a contributing member of
 
02:29:34.870 --> 02:29:34.880 align:start position:0%
this state so why can't we allow
 
02:29:36.550 --> 02:29:36.560 align:start position:0%
individuals like her to obtain a
 
02:29:39.070 --> 02:29:39.080 align:start position:0%
driver's license stories like this are
 
02:29:41.389 --> 02:29:41.399 align:start position:0%
very common we've had so many today but
 
02:29:42.750 --> 02:29:42.760 align:start position:0%
i' would also like to speak on a
 
02:29:45.110 --> 02:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
personal experience when I was waiting
 
02:29:47.550 --> 02:29:47.560 align:start position:0%
for the renewal of my Visa
 
02:29:50.830 --> 02:29:50.840 align:start position:0%
um I was worried about what I would do
 
02:29:53.510 --> 02:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
if I did not get that paper in time uh
 
02:29:56.990 --> 02:29:57.000 align:start position:0%
cuz my driver's license uh is tied to um
 
02:30:01.070 --> 02:30:01.080 align:start position:0%
my Visa and um I was very fearful
 
02:30:03.710 --> 02:30:03.720 align:start position:0%
because I was still legal here still
 
02:30:05.870 --> 02:30:05.880 align:start position:0%
working here but not having that
 
02:30:08.429 --> 02:30:08.439 align:start position:0%
driver's license meant that I either I
 
02:30:10.469 --> 02:30:10.479 align:start position:0%
have to make choices either to drive
 
02:30:12.830 --> 02:30:12.840 align:start position:0%
without a driver's license or figure out
 
02:30:14.630 --> 02:30:14.640 align:start position:0%
some other sort of way which is really
 
02:30:18.030 --> 02:30:18.040 align:start position:0%
difficult in Hampshire but lucky for me
 
02:30:20.389 --> 02:30:20.399 align:start position:0%
my Visa was approved in time that I was
 
02:30:22.309 --> 02:30:22.319 align:start position:0%
able to renew my driver's license which
 
02:30:24.750 --> 02:30:24.760 align:start position:0%
is attached to my which is um the
 
02:30:27.630 --> 02:30:27.640 align:start position:0%
process itself and the dates are tied
 
02:30:30.230 --> 02:30:30.240 align:start position:0%
together uh but if I had to make a
 
02:30:32.510 --> 02:30:32.520 align:start position:0%
choice of driving by a driver's license
 
02:30:34.750 --> 02:30:34.760 align:start position:0%
and I was ever stopped I could get a
 
02:30:37.110 --> 02:30:37.120 align:start position:0%
record and for for the record for
 
02:30:38.990 --> 02:30:39.000 align:start position:0%
everyone here I don't have anything on
 
02:30:42.710 --> 02:30:42.720 align:start position:0%
my record currently and that fear is um
 
02:30:44.309 --> 02:30:44.319 align:start position:0%
for me I was lucky enough to get the
 
02:30:46.510 --> 02:30:46.520 align:start position:0%
papers on time but that's not the case
 
02:30:49.590 --> 02:30:49.600 align:start position:0%
for many families and the other
 
02:30:51.349 --> 02:30:51.359 align:start position:0%
opposition we've had about this
 
02:30:54.790 --> 02:30:54.800 align:start position:0%
legislation is voting um I've been in
 
02:30:57.150 --> 02:30:57.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for almost 10 years now I've
 
02:31:00.269 --> 02:31:00.279 align:start position:0%
had a driver's license but I do know
 
02:31:02.389 --> 02:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
that that driver's license does not
 
02:31:03.870 --> 02:31:03.880 align:start position:0%
award me the opportunity or the
 
02:31:05.990 --> 02:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
eligibility to vote and for those
 
02:31:08.070 --> 02:31:08.080 align:start position:0%
reasons I know I'm not a citizen I'm not
 
02:31:10.030 --> 02:31:10.040 align:start position:0%
an eligible voter and I do not
 
02:31:12.550 --> 02:31:12.560 align:start position:0%
participate in voting because I know
 
02:31:14.190 --> 02:31:14.200 align:start position:0%
that that would jeopardize my status
 
02:31:15.910 --> 02:31:15.920 align:start position:0%
here and that's the case with Miss
 
02:31:17.950 --> 02:31:17.960 align:start position:0%
immigrants we will not go through that
 
02:31:20.070 --> 02:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
process where we know that if we did
 
02:31:21.670 --> 02:31:21.680 align:start position:0%
something like that it's criminal and
 
02:31:23.269 --> 02:31:23.279 align:start position:0%
it's going to jeopardize our status so I
 
02:31:25.190 --> 02:31:25.200 align:start position:0%
just wanted to relay that information
 
02:31:27.389 --> 02:31:27.399 align:start position:0%
for anyone that has concerns about
 
02:31:29.550 --> 02:31:29.560 align:start position:0%
people having driver's license and
 
02:31:31.670 --> 02:31:31.680 align:start position:0%
voting I have never voted and I will
 
02:31:34.150 --> 02:31:34.160 align:start position:0%
never vote I know that that's illegal I
 
02:31:36.070 --> 02:31:36.080 align:start position:0%
know I'm not eligible and so many
 
02:31:39.190 --> 02:31:39.200 align:start position:0%
immigrants know that so I want to urge
 
02:31:41.349 --> 02:31:41.359 align:start position:0%
committee members today to vote out to
 
02:31:45.349 --> 02:31:45.359 align:start position:0%
pass on HB 3 to8 thank you for your
 
02:31:47.990 --> 02:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
time time would you uh are you taking
 
02:31:48.000 --> 02:31:48.790 align:start position:0%
time time would you uh are you taking
any

02:31:48.790 --> 02:31:48.800 align:start position:0%
any
 
02:31:48.800 --> 02:31:51.590 align:start position:0%
any
questions

02:31:51.590 --> 02:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:31:54.030 --> 02:31:54.040 align:start position:0%
yeski thank you very much Mr chairman
 
02:31:55.230 --> 02:31:55.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question I
 
02:31:57.070 --> 02:31:57.080 align:start position:0%
wanted to ask this to someone previously
 
02:31:59.150 --> 02:31:59.160 align:start position:0%
we've heard testimony that undocumented
 
02:32:01.910 --> 02:32:01.920 align:start position:0%
persons are um still driving because
 
02:32:04.790 --> 02:32:04.800 align:start position:0%
they need to get to work or school or
 
02:32:07.230 --> 02:32:07.240 align:start position:0%
doctor's appointments does that mean
 
02:32:09.070 --> 02:32:09.080 align:start position:0%
that they are not getting car insurance
 
02:32:12.070 --> 02:32:12.080 align:start position:0%
do you know if you can get car insurance
 
02:32:14.910 --> 02:32:14.920 align:start position:0%
on a vehicle if you are not a licensed
 
02:32:18.429 --> 02:32:18.439 align:start position:0%
driver uh I'm aware of that situation uh
 
02:32:20.990 --> 02:32:21.000 align:start position:0%
but my guess is that someone could go
 
02:32:24.110 --> 02:32:24.120 align:start position:0%
through a third party if um if they
 
02:32:26.190 --> 02:32:26.200 align:start position:0%
wanted uh if they wanted Insurance on
 
02:32:28.469 --> 02:32:28.479 align:start position:0%
their car but again I believe there
 
02:32:30.590 --> 02:32:30.600 align:start position:0%
might be some people on this call that
 
02:32:32.030 --> 02:32:32.040 align:start position:0%
are listening to this sharing that have
 
02:32:34.070 --> 02:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
better answers uh that have dealt with
 
02:32:37.990 --> 02:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:43.830 --> 02:32:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:47.510 --> 02:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
much here recognizes Fergus gullen it's
 
02:32:49.469 --> 02:32:49.479 align:start position:0%
Board of the
 
02:33:02.670 --> 02:33:02.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:06.630 --> 02:33:06.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:09.550 --> 02:33:09.560 align:start position:0%
me okay thank you very much uh my name
 
02:33:11.590 --> 02:33:11.600 align:start position:0%
is Fergus Cullen I grew up in Guilford
 
02:33:13.750 --> 02:33:13.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I am a resident of Dover
 
02:33:16.309 --> 02:33:16.319 align:start position:0%
where I am a member of the city council
 
02:33:18.349 --> 02:33:18.359 align:start position:0%
in addition to that as it happens I am a
 
02:33:20.150 --> 02:33:20.160 align:start position:0%
former chairman of the New Hampshire
 
02:33:22.910 --> 02:33:22.920 align:start position:0%
Republican party I'm speaking asking you
 
02:33:26.790 --> 02:33:26.800 align:start position:0%
to vote ought to pass on HB 328 now for
 
02:33:29.710 --> 02:33:29.720 align:start position:0%
some this may be an abstract issue um
 
02:33:31.590 --> 02:33:31.600 align:start position:0%
but I want to tell you about a time when
 
02:33:33.950 --> 02:33:33.960 align:start position:0%
I was involved in an incident uh
 
02:33:36.590 --> 02:33:36.600 align:start position:0%
involving an undocumented person who was
 
02:33:39.830 --> 02:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
stopped driving a vehicle that I owned
 
02:33:42.389 --> 02:33:42.399 align:start position:0%
uh this happened about 10 years ago uh
 
02:33:44.590 --> 02:33:44.600 align:start position:0%
the per I got a call one night from a
 
02:33:46.510 --> 02:33:46.520 align:start position:0%
police officer in a town in
 
02:33:49.110 --> 02:33:49.120 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts it was after around 10:00
 
02:33:52.309 --> 02:33:52.319 align:start position:0%
at night uh they had stopped a uh a
 
02:33:55.110 --> 02:33:55.120 align:start position:0%
vehicle that I owned uh for a moving
 
02:33:57.790 --> 02:33:57.800 align:start position:0%
violation and so the driver of the car
 
02:34:00.830 --> 02:34:00.840 align:start position:0%
did not have a license now so what does
 
02:34:02.790 --> 02:34:02.800 align:start position:0%
the officer do they have a guy who
 
02:34:04.830 --> 02:34:04.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a license who's driving a
 
02:34:07.469 --> 02:34:07.479 align:start position:0%
car that doesn't belong to him so they
 
02:34:09.990 --> 02:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
call up that the car was registered and
 
02:34:12.309 --> 02:34:12.319 align:start position:0%
wolfroad New Hampshire uh where I owned
 
02:34:15.230 --> 02:34:15.240 align:start position:0%
a small business at the time and so they
 
02:34:17.630 --> 02:34:17.640 align:start position:0%
called they track me down that way it
 
02:34:19.510 --> 02:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
ended up I had to drive down to that
 
02:34:22.230 --> 02:34:22.240 align:start position:0%
town in Massachusetts uh to you know
 
02:34:24.550 --> 02:34:24.560 align:start position:0%
explain the situation to the identified
 
02:34:26.070 --> 02:34:26.080 align:start position:0%
as the owner of the vehicle they
 
02:34:28.030 --> 02:34:28.040 align:start position:0%
released the vehicle to me H they
 
02:34:30.190 --> 02:34:30.200 align:start position:0%
released the driver with a Summons the
 
02:34:32.429 --> 02:34:32.439 align:start position:0%
driver was a friend of one of my
 
02:34:35.190 --> 02:34:35.200 align:start position:0%
employees who was uh free to use that
 
02:34:39.269 --> 02:34:39.279 align:start position:0%
car and had lent it to a buddy of of his
 
02:34:41.389 --> 02:34:41.399 align:start position:0%
um so I also want to acknowledge you
 
02:34:43.030 --> 02:34:43.040 align:start position:0%
know and so that's how the situation
 
02:34:45.349 --> 02:34:45.359 align:start position:0%
happened um and you know in the end to
 
02:34:47.950 --> 02:34:47.960 align:start position:0%
me it was not AIG big deal but uh but
 
02:34:50.389 --> 02:34:50.399 align:start position:0%
you know it happened in the real world
 
02:34:52.429 --> 02:34:52.439 align:start position:0%
now this bill is obviously related to
 
02:34:55.309 --> 02:34:55.319 align:start position:0%
immigration and I want to mention that
 
02:34:57.750 --> 02:34:57.760 align:start position:0%
uh my parents immigrated to this country
 
02:35:00.030 --> 02:35:00.040 align:start position:0%

other immigrants uh in a way in to repay
 
02:35:40.590 --> 02:35:40.600 align:start position:0%

02:35:50.389 --> 02:35:50.399 align:start position:0%
nursing home in lonia and when I visit
 
02:35:52.710 --> 02:35:52.720 align:start position:0%
him I can't help but notice that many of
 
02:35:54.750 --> 02:35:54.760 align:start position:0%
those providing care to him are
 
02:35:57.510 --> 02:35:57.520 align:start position:0%
immigrants of a younger generation and
 
02:35:59.269 --> 02:35:59.279 align:start position:0%
uh it's a reminder that they are here to
 
02:36:01.750 --> 02:36:01.760 align:start position:0%
work they are here to better themselves
 
02:36:03.990 --> 02:36:04.000 align:start position:0%
I again I'm the city councel in Dober
 
02:36:05.950 --> 02:36:05.960 align:start position:0%
and uh we have undocumented people
 
02:36:08.309 --> 02:36:08.319 align:start position:0%
living and working in our community I
 
02:36:11.150 --> 02:36:11.160 align:start position:0%
think that uh this bill recognizes the
 
02:36:13.349 --> 02:36:13.359 align:start position:0%
reality that this population exists in
 
02:36:15.590 --> 02:36:15.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and that enhances Public
 
02:36:15.600 --> 02:36:16.630 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and that enhances Public

Safety
 
02:36:19.110 --> 02:36:19.120 align:start position:0%
uh to give them a driver's license uh
 
02:36:21.309 --> 02:36:21.319 align:start position:0%
with that I'll yield my time and yes I'm
 
02:36:22.830 --> 02:36:22.840 align:start position:0%
open to questions if any members of the
 
02:36:25.990 --> 02:36:26.000 align:start position:0%
committee have them thank you very
 
02:36:28.710 --> 02:36:28.720 align:start position:0%
much I see no questions so thank you
 
02:36:35.070 --> 02:36:35.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:41.469 --> 02:36:41.479 align:start position:0%

02:36:55.349 --> 02:36:55.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:56.990 --> 02:36:57.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
02:37:00.990 --> 02:37:01.000 align:start position:0%
committee uh am I coming in loud enough
 
02:37:03.190 --> 02:37:03.200 align:start position:0%
right great great thank you um for the
 
02:37:05.230 --> 02:37:05.240 align:start position:0%
record my name is Elizabeth Bei director
 
02:37:07.190 --> 02:37:07.200 align:start position:0%
of Motor Vehicles and today I'd like to
 
02:37:09.550 --> 02:37:09.560 align:start position:0%
speak to you in opposition to this bill
 
02:37:11.910 --> 02:37:11.920 align:start position:0%
um I will be very brief um and leave
 
02:37:13.710 --> 02:37:13.720 align:start position:0%
some time for questions I know you're
 
02:37:16.389 --> 02:37:16.399 align:start position:0%
over your time already there um some
 
02:37:19.389 --> 02:37:19.399 align:start position:0%
Provisions that we have um real concerns
 
02:37:22.950 --> 02:37:22.960 align:start position:0%
about in this bill including a provision
 
02:37:25.510 --> 02:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
that speaks to the fact that we would be
 
02:37:28.269 --> 02:37:28.279 align:start position:0%
required to notify an individual if
 
02:37:32.030 --> 02:37:32.040 align:start position:0%
there was an inquiry um made about them
 
02:37:35.150 --> 02:37:35.160 align:start position:0%
from um an agency that enforces
 
02:37:37.990 --> 02:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
immigration laws um we are concerned
 
02:37:40.389 --> 02:37:40.399 align:start position:0%
that that could potentially constitute
 
02:37:41.950 --> 02:37:41.960 align:start position:0%
interference with an criminal
 
02:37:43.750 --> 02:37:43.760 align:start position:0%
investigation or just interference with
 
02:37:46.230 --> 02:37:46.240 align:start position:0%
an investigation so that that is a point
 
02:37:49.349 --> 02:37:49.359 align:start position:0%
that I wanted to make um there are some
 
02:37:51.389 --> 02:37:51.399 align:start position:0%
questions that we have or issues that we
 
02:37:53.870 --> 02:37:53.880 align:start position:0%
have with the list of reliable official
 
02:37:56.110 --> 02:37:56.120 align:start position:0%
documentations but we could easily work
 
02:37:59.389 --> 02:37:59.399 align:start position:0%
with the sponsor on that as well but
 
02:38:01.230 --> 02:38:01.240 align:start position:0%
perhaps the biggest issue that we have
 
02:38:03.670 --> 02:38:03.680 align:start position:0%
is that this bill does not provide clear
 
02:38:06.750 --> 02:38:06.760 align:start position:0%
Authority for the division to issue
 
02:38:09.190 --> 02:38:09.200 align:start position:0%
licenses for those without a legal
 
02:38:12.910 --> 02:38:12.920 align:start position:0%
status for example currently under RSA
 
02:38:17.150 --> 02:38:17.160 align:start position:0%
263 39a there specific Provisions that
 
02:38:20.230 --> 02:38:20.240 align:start position:0%
allow us to issue licenses to those
 
02:38:22.510 --> 02:38:22.520 align:start position:0%
non-resident aliens that are here on a
 
02:38:24.910 --> 02:38:24.920 align:start position:0%
temporary status and that points out to
 
02:38:26.710 --> 02:38:26.720 align:start position:0%
those attending private educational
 
02:38:29.070 --> 02:38:29.080 align:start position:0%
institutions or public institutions and
 
02:38:31.750 --> 02:38:31.760 align:start position:0%
those that are engaging in lawful law uh
 
02:38:33.750 --> 02:38:33.760 align:start position:0%
employment I think what this bill is
 
02:38:36.030 --> 02:38:36.040 align:start position:0%
missing is really clear authorization
 
02:38:38.510 --> 02:38:38.520 align:start position:0%
for us to issue licenses to those
 
02:38:40.830 --> 02:38:40.840 align:start position:0%
without legal status and I'm not seeing
 
02:38:43.750 --> 02:38:43.760 align:start position:0%
that um as part of this bill as well
 
02:38:46.110 --> 02:38:46.120 align:start position:0%
with that I will and my testimony and
 
02:38:48.269 --> 02:38:48.279 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to actually I will take that
 
02:38:50.070 --> 02:38:50.080 align:start position:0%
back for a second I I do want to just
 
02:38:51.910 --> 02:38:51.920 align:start position:0%
bring up another point there was a lot
 
02:38:54.110 --> 02:38:54.120 align:start position:0%
of discussion about the Asylum status as
 
02:38:56.150 --> 02:38:56.160 align:start position:0%
well and I I do want to remind the
 
02:38:57.990 --> 02:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
committee that last year I believe
 
02:38:59.950 --> 02:38:59.960 align:start position:0%
representative Sykes had introduced the
 
02:39:02.870 --> 02:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
bill it was HB um
 
02:39:06.349 --> 02:39:06.359 align:start position:0%
1700 that attempted to introduce to this
 
02:39:10.230 --> 02:39:10.240 align:start position:0%
particular law RSA 269 39a another
 
02:39:12.790 --> 02:39:12.800 align:start position:0%
category of individuals that would be
 
02:39:14.830 --> 02:39:14.840 align:start position:0%
allowed to obtain a license and that was
 
02:39:16.510 --> 02:39:16.520 align:start position:0%
those who have found filed a complete
 
02:39:20.389 --> 02:39:20.399 align:start position:0%
application for an asylum status so um
 
02:39:22.070 --> 02:39:22.080 align:start position:0%
but I believe that bill may have been a
 
02:39:24.190 --> 02:39:24.200 align:start position:0%
victim of the pandemic as well so if if
 
02:39:25.670 --> 02:39:25.680 align:start position:0%
you'd like to take a look at that bill
 
02:39:27.030 --> 02:39:27.040 align:start position:0%
as well I think the language was there
 
02:39:28.429 --> 02:39:28.439 align:start position:0%
and I know we worked with a sponsor on
 
02:39:30.389 --> 02:39:30.399 align:start position:0%
that language as well with that I will
 
02:39:32.190 --> 02:39:32.200 align:start position:0%
end my testimony and I'm happy to answer
 
02:39:33.910 --> 02:39:33.920 align:start position:0%
any questions that you might
 
02:39:38.030 --> 02:39:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:40.110 --> 02:39:40.120 align:start position:0%
lki thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
02:39:41.950 --> 02:39:41.960 align:start position:0%
director for taking my question I guess
 
02:39:45.309 --> 02:39:45.319 align:start position:0%
I'm a little confused about um not your
 
02:39:47.070 --> 02:39:47.080 align:start position:0%
last point about the Asylum bill I do
 
02:39:50.230 --> 02:39:50.240 align:start position:0%
remember that um very well but about the
 
02:39:51.790 --> 02:39:51.800 align:start position:0%
um it doesn't provide the authority to
 
02:39:56.190 --> 02:39:56.200 align:start position:0%
issue licenses um can you maybe break
 
02:39:58.630 --> 02:39:58.640 align:start position:0%
that down a little bit
 
02:40:01.790 --> 02:40:01.800 align:start position:0%
because um I guess as I'm looking at
 
02:40:05.230 --> 02:40:05.240 align:start position:0%
this it looks like they're adding this
 
02:40:08.950 --> 02:40:08.960 align:start position:0%
line in as um another option are you
 
02:40:12.750 --> 02:40:12.760 align:start position:0%
saying that potentially this needs to go
 
02:40:15.670 --> 02:40:15.680 align:start position:0%
elsewhere um what I'm seeing is that
 
02:40:17.950 --> 02:40:17.960 align:start position:0%
that the bill introduces a number of
 
02:40:19.910 --> 02:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
documents that could be presented to us
 
02:40:21.790 --> 02:40:21.800 align:start position:0%
for identification
 
02:40:24.790 --> 02:40:24.800 align:start position:0%
purposes but I am not seeing a part of
 
02:40:27.309 --> 02:40:27.319 align:start position:0%
the bill that authorizes the department
 
02:40:30.309 --> 02:40:30.319 align:start position:0%
to issue a license to someone who does
 
02:40:33.750 --> 02:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:36.269 --> 02:40:36.279 align:start position:0%
status So currently when we issue a
 
02:40:39.269 --> 02:40:39.279 align:start position:0%
license we verify either US citizenship
 
02:40:41.110 --> 02:40:41.120 align:start position:0%
or for those that are not citizens we
 
02:40:43.990 --> 02:40:44.000 align:start position:0%
are requiring proof of legal um presence
 
02:40:48.230 --> 02:40:48.240 align:start position:0%
in the US particularly under RSA 26339 a
 
02:40:51.429 --> 02:40:51.439 align:start position:0%
this bill seems to be lacking that that
 
02:40:53.429 --> 02:40:53.439 align:start position:0%
um specific
 
02:40:56.389 --> 02:40:56.399 align:start position:0%
authorization to issue licenses to those
 
02:40:59.990 --> 02:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:04.790 --> 02:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:12.349 --> 02:41:12.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:15.269 --> 02:41:15.279 align:start position:0%
three starting at um line four where
 
02:41:18.269 --> 02:41:18.279 align:start position:0%
it's says the issuances of licenses
 
02:41:21.269 --> 02:41:21.279 align:start position:0%
application oh I'm sorry yeah number
 
02:41:23.750 --> 02:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
four under there where it shows the
 
02:41:27.910 --> 02:41:27.920 align:start position:0%
documents that can be used um so what
 
02:41:31.110 --> 02:41:31.120 align:start position:0%
you're saying is this is not enough even
 
02:41:34.950 --> 02:41:34.960 align:start position:0%
though it's specifies that someone um
 
02:41:37.230 --> 02:41:37.240 align:start position:0%
could present these other forms of
 
02:41:37.240 --> 02:41:39.429 align:start position:0%
could present these other forms of
documentation

02:41:39.429 --> 02:41:39.439 align:start position:0%
documentation
 
02:41:41.750 --> 02:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
exactly would
 
02:41:44.429 --> 02:41:44.439 align:start position:0%
sorry may I clarify one more
 
02:41:44.439 --> 02:41:46.349 align:start position:0%
sorry may I clarify one more
thing

02:41:46.349 --> 02:41:46.359 align:start position:0%
thing
 
02:41:48.309 --> 02:41:48.319 align:start position:0%
yes um
 
02:41:53.469 --> 02:41:53.479 align:start position:0%
so where would you require that
 
02:41:55.990 --> 02:41:56.000 align:start position:0%
authorization I mean it doesn't go here
 
02:41:59.670 --> 02:41:59.680 align:start position:0%
is what I'm I'm trying to figure out um
 
02:42:02.750 --> 02:42:02.760 align:start position:0%
right um I would suggest adding another
 
02:42:04.910 --> 02:42:04.920 align:start position:0%
paragraph either within
 
02:42:08.630 --> 02:42:08.640 align:start position:0%
26938 maybe calling it 38b just to
 
02:42:10.910 --> 02:42:10.920 align:start position:0%
provide a clear authorization that
 
02:42:13.870 --> 02:42:13.880 align:start position:0%
because again the law clearly dis um
 
02:42:16.469 --> 02:42:16.479 align:start position:0%
clearly identifies the narrow scope of
 
02:42:21.389 --> 02:42:21.399 align:start position:0%
those non-resident aliens um that are
 
02:42:23.389 --> 02:42:23.399 align:start position:0%
that are currently qualified for a
 
02:42:25.110 --> 02:42:25.120 align:start position:0%
license so potentially maybe looking at
 
02:42:28.590 --> 02:42:28.600 align:start position:0%
a b or another paragraph within that
 
02:42:33.349 --> 02:42:33.359 align:start position:0%
section thank you thank you
 
02:42:39.269 --> 02:42:39.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:44.349 --> 02:42:44.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:44.359 --> 02:42:46.710 align:start position:0%

incarcerated for example um you
 
02:44:22.590 --> 02:44:22.600 align:start position:0%

part you guys hear
 
02:45:46.150 --> 02:45:46.160 align:start position:0%
me shortly after you were talking about
 
02:45:47.910 --> 02:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
the the difficulty the homeless people
 
02:45:49.510 --> 02:45:49.520 align:start position:0%

02:45:54.190 --> 02:45:54.200 align:start position:0%
sure that you know we we separate that
 
02:45:56.190 --> 02:45:56.200 align:start position:0%
conversation is not only
 
02:45:59.230 --> 02:45:59.240 align:start position:0%
immigrants uh being hurt by this but
 
02:46:01.830 --> 02:46:01.840 align:start position:0%
also uh homeless people and people
 
02:46:03.670 --> 02:46:03.680 align:start position:0%
re-entering Society from from being in
 
02:46:06.309 --> 02:46:06.319 align:start position:0%
jail for example but uh going back to
 
02:46:08.269 --> 02:46:08.279 align:start position:0%
the topic I just want to share with you
 
02:46:09.830 --> 02:46:09.840 align:start position:0%
that for three years of my life here in
 
02:46:11.469 --> 02:46:11.479 align:start position:0%
the United States especially in New
 
02:46:13.309 --> 02:46:13.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I was an undocumented
 
02:46:16.389 --> 02:46:16.399 align:start position:0%
immigrant and I wish back then I had a
 
02:46:17.950 --> 02:46:17.960 align:start position:0%
license to be able to drive my daughter
 
02:46:19.870 --> 02:46:19.880 align:start position:0%
to school or my son to a medical
 
02:46:21.790 --> 02:46:21.800 align:start position:0%
appointment or even just driving to
 
02:46:24.389 --> 02:46:24.399 align:start position:0%
soccer class soccer camp so uh I think
 
02:46:26.590 --> 02:46:26.600 align:start position:0%
this bill will benefit many people will
 
02:46:28.269 --> 02:46:28.279 align:start position:0%
make the road safer for many Gran
 
02:46:30.590 --> 02:46:30.600 align:start position:0%
Staters so I'm asking you here please to
 
02:46:33.349 --> 02:46:33.359 align:start position:0%
support this bill and uh thank you very
 
02:46:40.349 --> 02:46:40.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:00.630 --> 02:47:00.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:11.870 --> 02:47:11.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:14.469 --> 02:47:14.479 align:start position:0%
ER need to unmute okay there you go
 
02:47:17.830 --> 02:47:17.840 align:start position:0%
hello can you hear me can now good good
 
02:47:19.830 --> 02:47:19.840 align:start position:0%
awesome thank you so much my name is
 
02:47:22.269 --> 02:47:22.279 align:start position:0%
Asma El honei and I am with rights and
 
02:47:23.750 --> 02:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
democracy New Hampshire we're a
 
02:47:25.950 --> 02:47:25.960 align:start position:0%
Grassroots organization that promotes
 
02:47:28.389 --> 02:47:28.399 align:start position:0%
human rights um I just first want to
 
02:47:31.269 --> 02:47:31.279 align:start position:0%
start off by addressing what the DMV uh
 
02:47:35.590 --> 02:47:35.600 align:start position:0%
person said in regards to 263 statuette
 
02:47:37.750 --> 02:47:37.760 align:start position:0%
that doesn't allow issuing driver's
 
02:47:40.990 --> 02:47:41.000 align:start position:0%
licenses um this actually does allow the
 
02:47:44.190 --> 02:47:44.200 align:start position:0%
DMV to issue driver's licenses because
 
02:47:46.630 --> 02:47:46.640 align:start position:0%
it amends the section to issue licenses
 
02:47:49.110 --> 02:47:49.120 align:start position:0%
without a social security um the list of
 
02:47:51.710 --> 02:47:51.720 align:start position:0%
the documentation that is being amended
 
02:47:53.950 --> 02:47:53.960 align:start position:0%
is compliant with the list from the
 
02:47:55.830 --> 02:47:55.840 align:start position:0%
reciprocity schedule under the
 
02:47:58.309 --> 02:47:58.319 align:start position:0%
Department of State uh which is the same
 
02:48:01.710 --> 02:48:01.720 align:start position:0%
list that the DMV uses uh the statue the
 
02:48:04.070 --> 02:48:04.080 align:start position:0%
statute does not prevent law enforcement
 
02:48:06.590 --> 02:48:06.600 align:start position:0%
from getting records from DMV for
 
02:48:10.070 --> 02:48:10.080 align:start position:0%
criminal investigation um only civil
 
02:48:11.630 --> 02:48:11.640 align:start position:0%
investigations so that's the main
 
02:48:13.550 --> 02:48:13.560 align:start position:0%
difference so the Clause is merely to
 
02:48:16.070 --> 02:48:16.080 align:start position:0%
prevent ice from um fishing for
 
02:48:18.389 --> 02:48:18.399 align:start position:0%
information of undocumented immigrants
 
02:48:21.870 --> 02:48:21.880 align:start position:0%
in DMV's database like um exactly what
 
02:48:24.910 --> 02:48:24.920 align:start position:0%
happened in Vermont uh so um yeah so I
 
02:48:28.389 --> 02:48:28.399 align:start position:0%
just wanted to share that uh and also um
 
02:48:29.830 --> 02:48:29.840 align:start position:0%
just wanted to share that the majority
 
02:48:31.510 --> 02:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
of people in the United States that are
 
02:48:34.230 --> 02:48:34.240 align:start position:0%
here without documentation actually came
 
02:48:37.349 --> 02:48:37.359 align:start position:0%
uh legally and then uh most people just
 
02:48:39.630 --> 02:48:39.640 align:start position:0%
couldn't um like renew because of
 
02:48:42.790 --> 02:48:42.800 align:start position:0%
language barriers Etc uh and so the fact
 
02:48:44.550 --> 02:48:44.560 align:start position:0%
is undocumented people are here there
 
02:48:47.230 --> 02:48:47.240 align:start position:0%
are 15,000 you saw estimates between 15
 
02:48:50.030 --> 02:48:50.040 align:start position:0%
to 17,000 undocumented people in our
 
02:48:53.309 --> 02:48:53.319 align:start position:0%
state they are driving whether we like
 
02:48:55.830 --> 02:48:55.840 align:start position:0%
it or not so why not create Avenues to
 
02:48:57.469 --> 02:48:57.479 align:start position:0%
make it safer for all of us so that
 
02:48:59.510 --> 02:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
they're going through um Avenues where
 
02:49:02.389 --> 02:49:02.399 align:start position:0%
they're getting tested and so um also I
 
02:49:04.469 --> 02:49:04.479 align:start position:0%
just wanted to sh say that if I was for
 
02:49:08.429 --> 02:49:08.439 align:start position:0%
example undocumented and I hit a car um
 
02:49:10.990 --> 02:49:11.000 align:start position:0%
I would not stay because of the fact
 
02:49:13.349 --> 02:49:13.359 align:start position:0%
that the possibility of it could be
 
02:49:15.389 --> 02:49:15.399 align:start position:0%
detrimental to me because I don't have a
 
02:49:17.070 --> 02:49:17.080 align:start position:0%
license and I'm afraid I'm going to be
 
02:49:19.389 --> 02:49:19.399 align:start position:0%
deported so of course I'd flee the scene
 
02:49:21.349 --> 02:49:21.359 align:start position:0%
versus if I had a license I would feel
 
02:49:23.550 --> 02:49:23.560 align:start position:0%
comfortable enough to stay so that when
 
02:49:25.349 --> 02:49:25.359 align:start position:0%
police came I have something to offer
 
02:49:27.950 --> 02:49:27.960 align:start position:0%
them um so it's just all around safe for
 
02:49:30.830 --> 02:49:30.840 align:start position:0%
everyone and I highly recommend that we
 
02:49:33.150 --> 02:49:33.160 align:start position:0%
uh pass this bill
 
02:49:36.510 --> 02:49:36.520 align:start position:0%
please you very much see no questions
 
02:49:38.150 --> 02:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
from the committee thank you again good
 
02:49:40.790 --> 02:49:40.800 align:start position:0%

02:49:40.800 --> 02:49:41.550 align:start position:0%
afternoon Mr chair I just want to bring
a

02:49:41.550 --> 02:49:41.560 align:start position:0%
a

point Travis's head headset has died and
 
02:49:48.349 --> 02:49:48.359 align:start position:0%
he's charging it for uh the exec session
 
02:49:50.630 --> 02:49:50.640 align:start position:0%
later so he can't really hear what's
 
02:49:54.790 --> 02:49:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:57.349 --> 02:49:57.359 align:start position:0%
speaker I can hear just trying to keep
 
02:49:59.110 --> 02:49:59.120 align:start position:0%
it on the charger so it charges before
 
02:50:01.190 --> 02:50:01.200 align:start position:0%

to read a testimony from a fellow
Dartmouth

02:50:34.710 --> 02:50:34.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:37.830 --> 02:50:37.840 align:start position:0%
student to whom it may concern my name
 
02:50:41.550 --> 02:50:41.560 align:start position:0%
is Juan Quinones sepa and I publicly
 
02:50:45.389 --> 02:50:45.399 align:start position:0%
voice my support for HB 328 I'm a
 
02:50:46.990 --> 02:50:47.000 align:start position:0%
current Dartmouth student and a
 
02:50:48.990 --> 02:50:49.000 align:start position:0%
co-director of the Coalition for
 
02:50:50.950 --> 02:50:50.960 align:start position:0%
immigration reform and equality at
 
02:50:53.389 --> 02:50:53.399 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth as well as a co-founder for
 
02:50:56.630 --> 02:50:56.640 align:start position:0%
the forza Farm Workers Fund in my role
 
02:50:58.389 --> 02:50:58.399 align:start position:0%
and through the years I have seen the
 
02:51:00.510 --> 02:51:00.520 align:start position:0%
challenges that undocumented people face
 
02:51:03.110 --> 02:51:03.120 align:start position:0%
at Dartmouth the Upper Valley and New
 
02:51:06.190 --> 02:51:06.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as a United States citizen I
 
02:51:08.030 --> 02:51:08.040 align:start position:0%
have the privilege of navigating this
 
02:51:10.510 --> 02:51:10.520 align:start position:0%
space differently than my undocumented
 
02:51:12.590 --> 02:51:12.600 align:start position:0%
neor neighbors I don't worry about
 
02:51:15.710 --> 02:51:15.720 align:start position:0%
issues of legality or concerns of using
 
02:51:18.190 --> 02:51:18.200 align:start position:0%
motorized vehicles to navigate spaces
 
02:51:20.510 --> 02:51:20.520 align:start position:0%
outside of Dartmouth yet because of the
 
02:51:22.349 --> 02:51:22.359 align:start position:0%
current political reinforcement of the
 
02:51:24.070 --> 02:51:24.080 align:start position:0%
driving license requirements in New
 
02:51:26.469 --> 02:51:26.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you are political
 
02:51:29.269 --> 02:51:29.279 align:start position:0%
Representatives that if I may remind we
 
02:51:32.110 --> 02:51:32.120 align:start position:0%
helped elect are causing direct harm to
 
02:51:34.229 --> 02:51:34.239 align:start position:0%
residents of New Hampshire contrary to
 
02:51:35.990 --> 02:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
what the proponents against this bill
 
02:51:38.750 --> 02:51:38.760 align:start position:0%
try to instill upon you allowing folks
 
02:51:40.950 --> 02:51:40.960 align:start position:0%
to gain access to a driver's license
 
02:51:42.510 --> 02:51:42.520 align:start position:0%
will in fact raise New Hampshire's
 
02:51:45.510 --> 02:51:45.520 align:start position:0%
economy contribute to Community
 
02:51:47.550 --> 02:51:47.560 align:start position:0%
inclusion and increase the cultural and

unpredictability we felt and still do
 
02:51:57.269 --> 02:51:57.279 align:start position:0%
since the pandemic while some of us are
 
02:51:59.590 --> 02:51:59.600 align:start position:0%
only privileged to have recently
 
02:52:01.229 --> 02:52:01.239 align:start position:0%
experienced these feelings for this past
 
02:52:03.030 --> 02:52:03.040 align:start position:0%
year but many of our neighbors have been
 
02:52:04.670 --> 02:52:04.680 align:start position:0%
living with these fears since they first
 
02:52:06.349 --> 02:52:06.359 align:start position:0%
moved to New Hampshire there's no
 
02:52:08.070 --> 02:52:08.080 align:start position:0%

felt very strongly about this issue um
 
02:53:07.790 --> 02:53:07.800 align:start position:0%
so here the testimony goes as follow um
 
02:53:09.630 --> 02:53:09.640 align:start position:0%
dear representative Walsh and members of
 
02:53:11.750 --> 02:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
the House Transportation committee my
 
02:53:13.830 --> 02:53:13.840 align:start position:0%
name is Megan karthy and I submit this
 
02:53:17.510 --> 02:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
written test in strong support of HB 328
 
02:53:19.070 --> 02:53:19.080 align:start position:0%
I am currently a Dartmouth student and
 
02:53:20.510 --> 02:53:20.520 align:start position:0%
the co-director of communications for
 
02:53:22.429 --> 02:53:22.439 align:start position:0%
dart's Coalition for immigration reform
 
02:53:24.550 --> 02:53:24.560 align:start position:0%
and equality as a member of the broader
 
02:53:25.790 --> 02:53:25.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and Upper Valley
 
02:53:27.710 --> 02:53:27.720 align:start position:0%
communities I respect and value my
 
02:53:29.910 --> 02:53:29.920 align:start position:0%
undocumented peers and neighbors the
 
02:53:32.590 --> 02:53:32.600 align:start position:0%
passage of HB 328 would not only benefit
 
02:53:34.389 --> 02:53:34.399 align:start position:0%
undocumented persons and provide them
 
02:53:36.269 --> 02:53:36.279 align:start position:0%
with the dignity they deserve but it
 
02:53:38.389 --> 02:53:38.399 align:start position:0%
would also promote Road Safety stimulate
 
02:53:40.349 --> 02:53:40.359 align:start position:0%
the economy and Foster a greater sense
 
02:53:42.950 --> 02:53:42.960 align:start position:0%
of community and inclusivity allowing
 
02:53:45.429 --> 02:53:45.439 align:start position:0%
undocumented individuals to to receive
 
02:53:47.150 --> 02:53:47.160 align:start position:0%
driver licenses would respect their
 
02:53:48.710 --> 02:53:48.720 align:start position:0%
dignity as fellow members of our shared
 
02:53:50.510 --> 02:53:50.520 align:start position:0%
Community all people have a right to
 
02:53:52.150 --> 02:53:52.160 align:start position:0%
food housing and medical care and
 
02:53:53.910 --> 02:53:53.920 align:start position:0%
drivers's licenses would make these
 
02:53:56.269 --> 02:53:56.279 align:start position:0%
resources more readily accessible
 
02:53:57.790 --> 02:53:57.800 align:start position:0%
additionally driver's licenses would
 
02:53:59.550 --> 02:53:59.560 align:start position:0%
ensure Road Safety because it guarantees
 
02:54:01.429 --> 02:54:01.439 align:start position:0%
that everyone who drives on the road has
 
02:54:03.790 --> 02:54:03.800 align:start position:0%
been properly assessed and qualified by
 
02:54:06.030 --> 02:54:06.040 align:start position:0%
the state furthermore having driver's
 
02:54:07.790 --> 02:54:07.800 align:start position:0%
licenses can make undocumented persons
 
02:54:09.830 --> 02:54:09.840 align:start position:0%
more active members of the economy it
 
02:54:11.269 --> 02:54:11.279 align:start position:0%
would be easier to travel to work and
 
02:54:12.870 --> 02:54:12.880 align:start position:0%
engage with local businesses as
 
02:54:14.950 --> 02:54:14.960 align:start position:0%
consumers finally undocumented
 
02:54:16.510 --> 02:54:16.520 align:start position:0%
individuals would be able to participate
 
02:54:17.950 --> 02:54:17.960 align:start position:0%
more frequently in cultural and
 
02:54:19.229 --> 02:54:19.239 align:start position:0%
community events because driver's
 
02:54:20.910 --> 02:54:20.920 align:start position:0%
licenses would make these activities
 
02:54:23.070 --> 02:54:23.080 align:start position:0%
more accessible and inclusive for the
 
02:54:24.830 --> 02:54:24.840 align:start position:0%
aforementioned reasons I strongly urge
 
02:54:26.710 --> 02:54:26.720 align:start position:0%

02:54:32.950 --> 02:54:32.960 align:start position:0%

04:50:15.990 --> 04:50:16.000 align:start position:0%
speak I think um this bill would require
 
04:50:17.430 --> 04:50:17.440 align:start position:0%
the commissioner of Department of Safety
 
04:50:19.110 --> 04:50:19.120 align:start position:0%
to issue a driver's license to any
 
04:50:21.270 --> 04:50:21.280 align:start position:0%

04:50:22.948 --> 04:50:22.958 align:start position:0%
evidence of completion of a course of
 
04:50:26.430 --> 04:50:26.440 align:start position:0%
driver ed in any state and the bill is
 
04:50:28.868 --> 04:50:28.878 align:start position:0%
really unnecessary motor vehicle already
 
04:50:30.548 --> 04:50:30.558 align:start position:0%
handles these reciprocity driver
 
04:50:33.948 --> 04:50:33.958 align:start position:0%

04:50:36.270 --> 04:50:36.280 align:start position:0%
have documentation on their website
 
04:50:38.670 --> 04:50:38.680 align:start position:0%
telling people what they need to do and
 
04:50:40.270 --> 04:50:40.280 align:start position:0%

04:50:48.788 --> 04:50:48.798 align:start position:0%
unnecessary further
 
04:50:50.868 --> 04:50:50.878 align:start position:0%

04:53:11.590 --> 04:53:11.600 align:start position:0%
share those amendments and
 
04:53:14.910 --> 04:53:14.920 align:start position:0%
then so why don't
 
04:53:28.910 --> 04:53:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:31.750 --> 04:53:31.760 align:start position:0%
6288 you
 
04:53:43.070 --> 04:53:43.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:49.430 --> 04:53:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:53.948 --> 04:53:53.958 align:start position:0%
don't okay okay open the executive
 
04:53:55.830 --> 04:53:55.840 align:start position:0%
session up on House Bill
 
04:53:59.708 --> 04:53:59.718 align:start position:0%
628 that is relative to maximum vehicle
 
04:53:59.718 --> 04:54:01.150 align:start position:0%
628 that is relative to maximum vehicle
speed

04:54:01.150 --> 04:54:01.160 align:start position:0%
speed
 
04:54:04.990 --> 04:54:05.000 align:start position:0%
limitations chair recognizes
 
04:54:07.270 --> 04:54:07.280 align:start position:0%
representative Hill for a motion thank
 
04:54:09.788 --> 04:54:09.798 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman I would move retain on
 
04:54:12.708 --> 04:54:12.718 align:start position:0%
House Bill 628 motion is retained is
 
04:54:16.070 --> 04:54:16.080 align:start position:0%
there a second second by represent
 
04:54:18.270 --> 04:54:18.280 align:start position:0%
Gagney do you care to wish to speak to
 
04:54:21.390 --> 04:54:21.400 align:start position:0%
the motion I will briefly um I will just
 
04:54:24.430 --> 04:54:24.440 align:start position:0%
to say that um I think the original Bill
 
04:54:27.788 --> 04:54:27.798 align:start position:0%
had Merit I I don't agree with certainly
 
04:54:31.548 --> 04:54:31.558 align:start position:0%
a blanket across the board increase um
 
04:54:34.030 --> 04:54:34.040 align:start position:0%
but I think there are places within New
 
04:54:35.788 --> 04:54:35.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that the roads were designed
 
04:54:39.830 --> 04:54:39.840 align:start position:0%
sufficiently well that uh uh some roads
 
04:54:41.990 --> 04:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
could see an increase in mileage just
 
04:54:47.030 --> 04:54:47.040 align:start position:0%
the way U 93 has seen from um exit 17
 
04:54:49.670 --> 04:54:49.680 align:start position:0%
North so I would think that uh it may be
 
04:54:51.230 --> 04:54:51.240 align:start position:0%
something that the committee would like
 
04:54:55.190 --> 04:54:55.200 align:start position:0%
to explore for other roads within New
 
04:55:02.390 --> 04:55:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:02.400 --> 04:55:09.030 align:start position:0%
 
discussion

04:55:09.030 --> 04:55:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:12.430 --> 04:55:12.440 align:start position:0%
g g h go ahead represent
 
04:55:16.590 --> 04:55:16.600 align:start position:0%
SE thank you Mr chairman um if I
 
04:55:18.270 --> 04:55:18.280 align:start position:0%
understand the intention then in
 
04:55:19.948 --> 04:55:19.958 align:start position:0%
retaining this bill is that there would
 
04:55:22.910 --> 04:55:22.920 align:start position:0%
be further work done by the committee uh
 
04:55:27.070 --> 04:55:27.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:29.628 --> 04:55:29.638 align:start position:0%
session well it's if we retain it be
 
04:55:31.390 --> 04:55:31.400 align:start position:0%
before the committee by is it the
 
04:55:35.830 --> 04:55:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:37.070 --> 04:55:37.080 align:start position:0%
I haven't decided how I'm going to do
 
04:55:39.350 --> 04:55:39.360 align:start position:0%
all these subcommittees yet a lot of
 
04:55:41.150 --> 04:55:41.160 align:start position:0%
these we I'm going to obviously reach
 
04:55:44.510 --> 04:55:44.520 align:start position:0%
out to the sponsor see how much they
 
04:55:46.230 --> 04:55:46.240 align:start position:0%
want to
 
04:55:48.190 --> 04:55:48.200 align:start position:0%
participate so I guess I'm missing
 
04:55:49.990 --> 04:55:50.000 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding it
 
04:55:54.830 --> 04:55:54.840 align:start position:0%
chis well okay so let me try that again
 
04:55:59.830 --> 04:55:59.840 align:start position:0%
um my I I just wanted to I one of the
 
04:56:02.270 --> 04:56:02.280 align:start position:0%
we've all heard in the past that bills
 
04:56:04.628 --> 04:56:04.638 align:start position:0%
that get retained are often considered
 
04:56:07.070 --> 04:56:07.080 align:start position:0%
to be just a way of polite
 
04:56:11.310 --> 04:56:11.320 align:start position:0%
death and I I want to be I was trying to
 
04:56:13.670 --> 04:56:13.680 align:start position:0%
get an understanding from the chairman
 
04:56:15.628 --> 04:56:15.638 align:start position:0%
whether we'll actually work on this bill
 
04:56:15.638 --> 04:56:16.430 align:start position:0%
whether we'll actually work on this bill
or

04:56:16.430 --> 04:56:16.440 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:56:18.590 --> 04:56:18.600 align:start position:0%
whether eventually it'll just come back
 
04:56:20.788 --> 04:56:20.798 align:start position:0%
in the fall and we'll we'll vote on it
 
04:56:22.948 --> 04:56:22.958 align:start position:0%
again without without having had an
 
04:56:25.430 --> 04:56:25.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity to work on it Noe absolutely
 
04:56:27.350 --> 04:56:27.360 align:start position:0%
not I'm glad you rephrase the question
 
04:56:29.708 --> 04:56:29.718 align:start position:0%
for clarification um I'm not that kind
 
04:56:32.628 --> 04:56:32.638 align:start position:0%
of guy I don't do retention is a is a
 
04:56:34.868 --> 04:56:34.878 align:start position:0%
polite way to kill something the only
 
04:56:36.590 --> 04:56:36.600 align:start position:0%
exceptions we were asked to do possibly
 
04:56:39.548 --> 04:56:39.558 align:start position:0%
this time were to uh look at limiting
 
04:56:42.030 --> 04:56:42.040 align:start position:0%
you know the floor time with our our
 
04:56:44.150 --> 04:56:44.160 align:start position:0%
session but but that's not me I don't do
 
04:56:45.628 --> 04:56:45.638 align:start position:0%
it like that if we retain them it's for
 
04:56:48.230 --> 04:56:48.240 align:start position:0%
a good reason um and I do expect we'll
 
04:56:50.430 --> 04:56:50.440 align:start position:0%
work on it if it helps you I spoke with
 
04:56:52.788 --> 04:56:52.798 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor of this I explained to
 
04:56:54.190 --> 04:56:54.200 align:start position:0%
him the problems with the bill he gave
 
04:56:56.470 --> 04:56:56.480 align:start position:0%
us the first time he gets it he's fine
 
04:56:58.310 --> 04:56:58.320 align:start position:0%
with us retaining it and is willing to
 
04:57:00.750 --> 04:57:00.760 align:start position:0%
help us work on
 
04:57:06.390 --> 04:57:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:09.430 --> 04:57:09.440 align:start position:0%
thank you um I guess I'm a little
 
04:57:12.670 --> 04:57:12.680 align:start position:0%
confused by this motion um
 
04:57:15.430 --> 04:57:15.440 align:start position:0%
since I look at this and as the previous
 
04:57:17.670 --> 04:57:17.680 align:start position:0%
speaker who made the motion stated it's
 
04:57:22.190 --> 04:57:22.200 align:start position:0%
you know a blanket um raise the speed
 
04:57:24.590 --> 04:57:24.600 align:start position:0%
limit but it sounds like you want to
 
04:57:28.430 --> 04:57:28.440 align:start position:0%
retain it to work on addressing specific
 
04:57:30.708 --> 04:57:30.718 align:start position:0%
roadways and I was under the impression
 
04:57:32.190 --> 04:57:32.200 align:start position:0%
that the do
 
04:57:35.628 --> 04:57:35.638 align:start position:0%
already um has a process for addressing
 
04:57:38.350 --> 04:57:38.360 align:start position:0%
speed limits on different roadways so I
 
04:57:40.190 --> 04:57:40.200 align:start position:0%
guess I'm I'm just a little confused as
 
04:57:41.910 --> 04:57:41.920 align:start position:0%
to what the intent would be when we
 
04:57:44.750 --> 04:57:44.760 align:start position:0%
don't have specific roads or or projects
 
04:57:47.510 --> 04:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
in mind that were pointed out to us or
 
04:57:49.670 --> 04:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
not projects is the wrong word specific
 
04:57:52.628 --> 04:57:52.638 align:start position:0%
roadways well do has always had a
 
04:57:55.070 --> 04:57:55.080 align:start position:0%
process for raising speed limits but yet
 
04:57:57.470 --> 04:57:57.480 align:start position:0%
us we as a legislature also have the
 
04:57:59.230 --> 04:57:59.240 align:start position:0%
opportunity to make changes on top of
 
04:58:03.670 --> 04:58:03.680 align:start position:0%
that like we did with 93 seven years AG
 
04:58:05.750 --> 04:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
approximately seven years ago uh so
 
04:58:08.470 --> 04:58:08.480 align:start position:0%
that's the only thing that was looking
 
04:58:10.750 --> 04:58:10.760 align:start position:0%
at with this bill by retaining it is to
 
04:58:12.470 --> 04:58:12.480 align:start position:0%
possibly look at a couple other specific
 
04:58:14.548 --> 04:58:14.558 align:start position:0%
local that we might be able to do the
 
04:58:17.510 --> 04:58:17.520 align:start position:0%
same thing we did with 93 if at the end
 
04:58:19.788 --> 04:58:19.798 align:start position:0%
of the day the committee can't find any
 
04:58:22.190 --> 04:58:22.200 align:start position:0%
or the subcommittee rather can't find
 
04:58:24.150 --> 04:58:24.160 align:start position:0%
any that legitimate or worth it well
 
04:58:26.750 --> 04:58:26.760 align:start position:0%
then we'll look at it the
 
04:58:29.230 --> 04:58:29.240 align:start position:0%
fall in my opinion there are a few
 
04:58:31.708 --> 04:58:31.718 align:start position:0%
around the state that
 
04:58:35.310 --> 04:58:35.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:36.350 --> 04:58:36.360 align:start position:0%
I don't think it's going to be on the
 
04:58:41.110 --> 04:58:41.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:43.430 --> 04:58:43.440 align:start position:0%
States okay thank you just I'm having
 
04:58:45.070 --> 04:58:45.080 align:start position:0%
trouble your your audio is going in and
 
04:58:47.430 --> 04:58:47.440 align:start position:0%
out um but I think I I think I got the
 
04:58:49.548 --> 04:58:49.558 align:start position:0%
gist of what you're saying is is you
 
04:58:50.910 --> 04:58:50.920 align:start position:0%
think there are some roadways that we
 
04:58:53.990 --> 04:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
can address and we'll give it that time
 
04:58:57.430 --> 04:58:57.440 align:start position:0%
Y and if we're successful at it Ling it
 
04:58:59.510 --> 04:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
in the
 
04:59:02.110 --> 04:59:02.120 align:start position:0%
fall any other discussion and am I
 
04:59:04.990 --> 04:59:05.000 align:start position:0%
coming in any better
 
04:59:06.628 --> 04:59:06.638 align:start position:0%
yes a little bit a little bit yeah I
 
04:59:08.430 --> 04:59:08.440 align:start position:0%
think it was you were turning away and
 
04:59:10.030 --> 04:59:10.040 align:start position:0%
and looking at your notes while you were
 
04:59:10.040 --> 04:59:11.190 align:start position:0%
and looking at your notes while you were
speaking

04:59:11.190 --> 04:59:11.200 align:start position:0%
speaking
 
04:59:13.590 --> 04:59:13.600 align:start position:0%
perhaps all right any other no other
 
04:59:16.830 --> 04:59:16.840 align:start position:0%
discussion motion on the floor is to
 
04:59:19.670 --> 04:59:19.680 align:start position:0%
retain House Bill

motion I just find the failure to need
 
05:01:57.628 --> 05:01:57.638 align:start position:0%
to see the immediacy of passing
 
05:02:00.548 --> 05:02:00.558 align:start position:0%
legislation like
 
05:02:02.948 --> 05:02:02.958 align:start position:0%
this anybody else wish to speak
 
05:02:02.958 --> 05:02:05.750 align:start position:0%
this anybody else wish to speak
representative

05:02:05.750 --> 05:02:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:09.670 --> 05:02:09.680 align:start position:0%
SES thank you Mr chairman um as I had
 
05:02:13.190 --> 05:02:13.200 align:start position:0%
indicated in my uh introduction of the
 
05:02:16.470 --> 05:02:16.480 align:start position:0%
bill that this uh establishes a a
 
05:02:18.510 --> 05:02:18.520 align:start position:0%
precedent for fish and game and for the
 
05:02:21.110 --> 05:02:21.120 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety Marine Patrol to
 
05:02:21.120 --> 05:02:22.350 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety Marine Patrol to
make

05:02:22.350 --> 05:02:22.360 align:start position:0%
make
 
05:02:26.910 --> 05:02:26.920 align:start position:0%
uh to acknowledge the need for making uh
 
05:02:29.310 --> 05:02:29.320 align:start position:0%
law that would reflect the needs of
 
05:02:31.590 --> 05:02:31.600 align:start position:0%
persons who are handicapped that was the
 
05:02:33.110 --> 05:02:33.120 align:start position:0%
specific reason why this bill was
 
05:02:35.990 --> 05:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
brought forward I
 
05:02:38.390 --> 05:02:38.400 align:start position:0%
um while I acknowledge that it won't
 
05:02:40.910 --> 05:02:40.920 align:start position:0%
affect a ton of people um I think it's
 
05:02:43.788 --> 05:02:43.798 align:start position:0%
still an important policy decision that
 
05:02:45.670 --> 05:02:45.680 align:start position:0%
the this committee the transportation
 
05:02:47.230 --> 05:02:47.240 align:start position:0%
committee be
 
05:02:50.830 --> 05:02:50.840 align:start position:0%
encouraging uh the adoption of laws that
 
05:02:54.230 --> 05:02:54.240 align:start position:0%
would uh answer people who are
 
05:02:56.310 --> 05:02:56.320 align:start position:0%
handicapped being able to use the
 
05:02:58.628 --> 05:02:58.638 align:start position:0%
recreational resources of the state
 
05:03:01.788 --> 05:03:01.798 align:start position:0%
which they pay equally in order to do
 
05:03:03.390 --> 05:03:03.400 align:start position:0%
and um
 
05:03:05.750 --> 05:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
and for that reason I would urge a no
 
05:03:08.868 --> 05:03:08.878 align:start position:0%
vote on this on this
 
05:03:12.230 --> 05:03:12.240 align:start position:0%
motion else wish
 
05:03:15.868 --> 05:03:15.878 align:start position:0%
to seeing none I'll uh I'll
 
05:03:18.470 --> 05:03:18.480 align:start position:0%
reply uh on this I do remember the
 
05:03:20.708 --> 05:03:20.718 align:start position:0%
hearing I believe it was Marine Patrol
 
05:03:22.830 --> 05:03:22.840 align:start position:0%
that was also opposed to this bill uh
 
05:03:24.628 --> 05:03:24.638 align:start position:0%
for exactly that setting
 
05:03:28.430 --> 05:03:28.440 align:start position:0%
precedence and I have to be honest
 
05:03:30.350 --> 05:03:30.360 align:start position:0%
representative I believe it was your own
 
05:03:32.230 --> 05:03:32.240 align:start position:0%
words no I don't believe it were your
 
05:03:34.510 --> 05:03:34.520 align:start position:0%
words that the basic intent of this was
 
05:03:36.430 --> 05:03:36.440 align:start position:0%
to limit as many people from going there
 
05:03:39.190 --> 05:03:39.200 align:start position:0%
as possible which is really not
 
05:03:42.270 --> 05:03:42.280 align:start position:0%
something I can support
 
05:03:45.430 --> 05:03:45.440 align:start position:0%

515 is there a
 
05:06:47.070 --> 05:06:47.080 align:start position:0%
second gag you wish to speak to your
 
05:06:51.230 --> 05:06:51.240 align:start position:0%
motion thank you Mr chairman um I think
 
05:06:52.910 --> 05:06:52.920 align:start position:0%
uh most of us are sensitive to the
 
05:06:54.670 --> 05:06:54.680 align:start position:0%
concerns heard in testimony from the
 
05:06:57.708 --> 05:06:57.718 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor indicating how difficult
 
05:07:00.430 --> 05:07:00.440 align:start position:0%
it is sometimes to begin the process of
 
05:07:02.948 --> 05:07:02.958 align:start position:0%
removing driving privileges from friends
 
05:07:04.590 --> 05:07:04.600 align:start position:0%
neighbors or family
 
05:07:08.070 --> 05:07:08.080 align:start position:0%
members uh this bill tends to tries to
 
05:07:09.788 --> 05:07:09.798 align:start position:0%
make that easier by allowing the
 
05:07:11.830 --> 05:07:11.840 align:start position:0%
reporting process to take place behind
 
05:07:13.310 --> 05:07:13.320 align:start position:0%
the V veil of
 
05:07:17.670 --> 05:07:17.680 align:start position:0%
secrecy um however the uh testimony from
 
05:07:20.150 --> 05:07:20.160 align:start position:0%
the director of the DMV giving
 
05:07:22.310 --> 05:07:22.320 align:start position:0%
statistics that it really is only about
 
05:07:24.230 --> 05:07:24.240 align:start position:0%
20 occurrences in
 
05:07:27.430 --> 05:07:27.440 align:start position:0%
2020 um and also the fact that she
 
05:07:31.470 --> 05:07:31.480 align:start position:0%
personally oversees all cases and feels
 
05:07:33.910 --> 05:07:33.920 align:start position:0%
strongly that new is beyond reproach in
 
05:07:36.948 --> 05:07:36.958 align:start position:0%
terms of handling cases with compassion
 
05:07:39.110 --> 05:07:39.120 align:start position:0%
and professionalism um I think we're
 
05:07:40.830 --> 05:07:40.840 align:start position:0%
working well and I think we should leave
 
05:07:44.270 --> 05:07:44.280 align:start position:0%
the situation as it
 
05:07:48.190 --> 05:07:48.200 align:start position:0%
stands else wish to speak

05:09:58.948 --> 05:09:58.958 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um I would like to
 
05:10:02.708 --> 05:10:02.718 align:start position:0%
make a motion to retain um House Bill 52
 
05:10:05.350 --> 05:10:05.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:09.070 --> 05:10:09.080 align:start position:0%
second a bit of guy care to care to

speak to your motion yes thank you Mr
 
05:10:12.948 --> 05:10:12.958 align:start position:0%
chairman I think uh this particular Bill
 
05:10:14.390 --> 05:10:14.400 align:start position:0%
although has some merits there's still
 
05:10:16.430 --> 05:10:16.440 align:start position:0%
some things that need to be worked on
 
05:10:19.430 --> 05:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
the definition of new for example there
 
05:10:21.470 --> 05:10:21.480 align:start position:0%
different perspectives on that so I
 
05:10:22.910 --> 05:10:22.920 align:start position:0%
think there's some issues here that have
 
05:10:25.510 --> 05:10:25.520 align:start position:0%
to be worked out for us before we can
 
05:10:25.520 --> 05:10:26.910 align:start position:0%
to be worked out for us before we can
consider

05:10:26.910 --> 05:10:26.920 align:start position:0%
consider
 
05:10:31.030 --> 05:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
any enough any further
 
05:10:31.040 --> 05:10:34.548 align:start position:0%
any enough any further
discussion

05:10:34.548 --> 05:10:34.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:38.150 --> 05:10:38.160 align:start position:0%
for your hand you are representative
 
05:10:42.548 --> 05:10:42.558 align:start position:0%
Sykes thank you Mr chairman um yeah have
 
05:10:44.750 --> 05:10:44.760 align:start position:0%
some anxieties about this bill I just
 
05:10:47.548 --> 05:10:47.558 align:start position:0%
think it is fundamentally flawed I'm not
 
05:10:51.030 --> 05:10:51.040 align:start position:0%
positive that we can fix it it's got
 
05:10:52.910 --> 05:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
enough issues that I would have to vote
 
05:10:56.670 --> 05:10:56.680 align:start position:0%
against a a retaining motion um in the
 
05:10:59.310 --> 05:10:59.320 align:start position:0%
chance that we might get an OT uh itl
 
05:11:01.350 --> 05:11:01.360 align:start position:0%
out of it but I think it's just too
 
05:11:04.910 --> 05:11:04.920 align:start position:0%
fundamentally flawed and uh we're going
 
05:11:04.920 --> 05:11:05.948 align:start position:0%
fundamentally flawed and uh we're going
to

05:11:05.948 --> 05:11:05.958 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:11:08.350 --> 05:11:08.360 align:start position:0%
have I don't know how many retained
 
05:11:10.070 --> 05:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
bills we are going to have but there's
 
05:11:11.868 --> 05:11:11.878 align:start position:0%
going to be a lot of them and I wonder
 
05:11:13.708 --> 05:11:13.718 align:start position:0%

05:11:19.590 --> 05:11:19.600 align:start position:0%
regard I
 
05:11:21.750 --> 05:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
also there's no other
 
05:11:25.590 --> 05:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
discussion I did speak with the uh Prim
 
05:11:27.390 --> 05:11:27.400 align:start position:0%
sponsor is this as well he's fine with
 
05:11:30.430 --> 05:11:30.440 align:start position:0%
to rain and is eager to learn and does
 
05:11:32.230 --> 05:11:32.240 align:start position:0%
recognize that his initial language had
 
05:11:35.510 --> 05:11:35.520 align:start position:0%
some problems um I think the theory is
 
05:11:37.310 --> 05:11:37.320 align:start position:0%
there I don't think the problems are
 
05:11:40.470 --> 05:11:40.480 align:start position:0%
that hard to get worked out um really
 
05:11:42.948 --> 05:11:42.958 align:start position:0%
don't see a heavy load so I ask the
 
05:11:45.110 --> 05:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
committee to support
 
05:11:48.030 --> 05:11:48.040 align:start position:0%
the any
 
05:11:51.390 --> 05:11:51.400 align:start position:0%

go into one this morning House Bill 352

05:13:21.310 --> 05:13:21.320 align:start position:0%

minutes Mr
chairman

05:13:23.230 --> 05:13:23.240 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
05:13:27.190 --> 05:13:27.200 align:start position:0%
um I I just want to make make note of my
 
05:13:30.628 --> 05:13:30.638 align:start position:0%
um objection to executing bills that we
 
05:13:32.190 --> 05:13:32.200 align:start position:0%
just heard the public hearing in of
 
05:13:35.390 --> 05:13:35.400 align:start position:0%
earlier today I I do this with being
 
05:13:38.390 --> 05:13:38.400 align:start position:0%
mindful of the fact that
 
05:13:42.470 --> 05:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
um much of our testimony today offered
 
05:13:45.150 --> 05:13:45.160 align:start position:0%
issues and opportunities to impr improve
 
05:13:47.868 --> 05:13:47.878 align:start position:0%
the bill uh through an amendment process
 
05:13:50.628 --> 05:13:50.638 align:start position:0%
that will not be possible if we exec the
 
05:13:54.430 --> 05:13:54.440 align:start position:0%
bill today um I I believe strongly that
 
05:13:58.948 --> 05:13:58.958 align:start position:0%
a there is no reason for any um Rush on
 
05:14:02.070 --> 05:14:02.080 align:start position:0%
Executive today as as I seem to call
 
05:14:04.750 --> 05:14:04.760 align:start position:0%
reading in the calendar that the that
 
05:14:08.390 --> 05:14:08.400 align:start position:0%
the speaker has extended the deadlines
 
05:14:12.948 --> 05:14:12.958 align:start position:0%
um there's also the possibility that we
 
05:14:14.708 --> 05:14:14.718 align:start position:0%
could you know make these bills a little
 
05:14:17.350 --> 05:14:17.360 align:start position:0%
better by uh doing a different motion
 
05:14:20.750 --> 05:14:20.760 align:start position:0%
and having the Senate um fix them if we
 
05:14:23.510 --> 05:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
have to vote on them today but I I think
 
05:14:26.470 --> 05:14:26.480 align:start position:0%
it would be a much better legislative
 
05:14:28.150 --> 05:14:28.160 align:start position:0%
process reflecting the needs of the
 
05:14:32.230 --> 05:14:32.240 align:start position:0%
public to give the opportunity to this
 
05:14:34.470 --> 05:14:34.480 align:start position:0%
committee to make changes on the bills
 
05:14:37.948 --> 05:14:37.958 align:start position:0%
that they might see that they may see
 
05:14:41.948 --> 05:14:41.958 align:start position:0%
um as as necessary and possible so I
 
05:14:43.670 --> 05:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
just want that objection noted and then
 
05:14:46.230 --> 05:14:46.240 align:start position:0%
we'll have further debate about whatever
 
05:14:50.230 --> 05:14:50.240 align:start position:0%
motion might be fair enough objection
 
05:14:53.470 --> 05:14:53.480 align:start position:0%
noted um I will go on to say that yes we
 
05:14:55.830 --> 05:14:55.840 align:start position:0%
can do it in our
 
05:14:59.470 --> 05:14:59.480 align:start position:0%
rules I also made it fully aware first
 
05:15:00.868 --> 05:15:00.878 align:start position:0%
first of all I have not taken advantage
 
05:15:02.270 --> 05:15:02.280 align:start position:0%
of the system
 
05:15:04.070 --> 05:15:04.080 align:start position:0%
but I did make mention that this was my
 
05:15:07.750 --> 05:15:07.760 align:start position:0%
intention a week ago and fully knowing
 
05:15:09.510 --> 05:15:09.520 align:start position:0%
we could have the opportunity to discuss
 
05:15:10.830 --> 05:15:10.840 align:start position:0%
them before the
 
05:15:13.350 --> 05:15:13.360 align:start position:0%
hearing U not that we've had the hearing
 
05:15:15.270 --> 05:15:15.280 align:start position:0%
I didn't hear anything at the hearing
 
05:15:16.868 --> 05:15:16.878 align:start position:0%
that would change anybody's mind in
 
05:15:19.310 --> 05:15:19.320 align:start position:0%
terms of myself personally I have not
 
05:15:21.708 --> 05:15:21.718 align:start position:0%
heard any objections yet in terms of any
 
05:15:25.310 --> 05:15:25.320 align:start position:0%
suggested amendments Etc um time is
 
05:15:26.788 --> 05:15:26.798 align:start position:0%
always of the essence I really don't
 
05:15:28.390 --> 05:15:28.400 align:start position:0%
want to drag this committee back up
 
05:15:31.070 --> 05:15:31.080 align:start position:0%
taxpayers expense for three bills to
 
05:15:31.080 --> 05:15:32.190 align:start position:0%
taxpayers expense for three bills to
exec

05:15:32.190 --> 05:15:32.200 align:start position:0%
exec
 
05:15:36.830 --> 05:15:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:40.948 --> 05:15:40.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:44.788 --> 05:15:44.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:47.990 --> 05:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
is just making a I haven't opened it up
 
05:15:50.868 --> 05:15:50.878 align:start position:0%
for 352 just making statement or did I
 
05:15:53.150 --> 05:15:53.160 align:start position:0%
open it
 
05:15:55.310 --> 05:15:55.320 align:start position:0%
up no I mentioned I was going to do it
 
05:15:58.070 --> 05:15:58.080 align:start position:0%
next I haven't made it
 
05:16:01.110 --> 05:16:01.120 align:start position:0%
official just a general statement this
 
05:16:03.230 --> 05:16:03.240 align:start position:0%
point on whether or not we should be
 
05:16:06.030 --> 05:16:06.040 align:start position:0%
taking up this
 
05:16:08.510 --> 05:16:08.520 align:start position:0%
morning Mr chairman can I just comment
 
05:16:10.548 --> 05:16:10.558 align:start position:0%
on something since you did ask if anyone
 
05:16:11.990 --> 05:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
had any
 
05:16:13.788 --> 05:16:13.798 align:start position:0%
comments thank you very much I
 
05:16:16.548 --> 05:16:16.558 align:start position:0%
appreciate it I I I guess I disagree
 
05:16:18.150 --> 05:16:18.160 align:start position:0%
with you a little bit on the fact that
 
05:16:19.548 --> 05:16:19.558 align:start position:0%
we didn't hear anything this morning
 
05:16:23.390 --> 05:16:23.400 align:start position:0%
that could um that came up that we
 
05:16:25.150 --> 05:16:25.160 align:start position:0%
didn't wouldn't didn't know in advance
 
05:16:27.430 --> 05:16:27.440 align:start position:0%
excuse me um I think there are a couple
 
05:16:29.270 --> 05:16:29.280 align:start position:0%
of issues with these bills that we could
 
05:16:31.510 --> 05:16:31.520 align:start position:0%
tweak verbage if someone had a concern
 
05:16:36.788 --> 05:16:36.798 align:start position:0%
with them and um just to uh Echo um
 
05:16:39.670 --> 05:16:39.680 align:start position:0%
representative syes the fact that the
 
05:16:41.868 --> 05:16:41.878 align:start position:0%
speaker has moved out those dates we do
 
05:16:43.350 --> 05:16:43.360 align:start position:0%
have a couple of weeks that we could
 
05:16:47.510 --> 05:16:47.520 align:start position:0%
meet one more time to try to um fix any
 
05:16:49.390 --> 05:16:49.400 align:start position:0%
problems that uh people had with these
 
05:16:51.628 --> 05:16:51.638 align:start position:0%
bills and I would prefer to do that as
 
05:16:54.270 --> 05:16:54.280 align:start position:0%
opposed to um shutting something now
 
05:16:56.948 --> 05:16:56.958 align:start position:0%
down and and being delayed yet another
 
05:16:58.590 --> 05:16:58.600 align:start position:0%
year or two years to be able to
 
05:17:00.868 --> 05:17:00.878 align:start position:0%
reintroduce the bill and try again thank
 
05:17:00.878 --> 05:17:03.270 align:start position:0%
reintroduce the bill and try again thank
you

05:17:03.270 --> 05:17:03.280 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:17:03.280 --> 05:17:04.948 align:start position:0%
you
right

05:17:04.948 --> 05:17:04.958 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:17:17.628 --> 05:17:17.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:20.750 --> 05:17:20.760 align:start position:0%
here again after hearing everything this
 
05:17:24.350 --> 05:17:24.360 align:start position:0%
morning I see nothing to deter us from
 
05:17:27.070 --> 05:17:27.080 align:start position:0%
moving forward with this uh for those of
 
05:17:28.470 --> 05:17:28.480 align:start position:0%
you that are new this is actually a
 
05:17:29.910 --> 05:17:29.920 align:start position:0%
procedure that goes on all the time in
 
05:17:33.310 --> 05:17:33.320 align:start position:0%
the set more often the not uh they'll
 
05:17:35.110 --> 05:17:35.120 align:start position:0%
exec the bills right after they hear it
 
05:17:36.590 --> 05:17:36.600 align:start position:0%
I've actually been a proponent of making
 
05:17:39.830 --> 05:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
this a house rule for a long time um I
 
05:17:41.548 --> 05:17:41.558 align:start position:0%
thought this was of an emergency issue
 
05:17:43.110 --> 05:17:43.120 align:start position:0%
or if I thought it was something that we
 
05:17:44.990 --> 05:17:45.000 align:start position:0%
could fix I would not do this but we're
 
05:17:46.708 --> 05:17:46.718 align:start position:0%
going to move forward opening up the
 
05:17:49.390 --> 05:17:49.400 align:start position:0%
executive session on House Bill
 
05:17:51.868 --> 05:17:51.878 align:start position:0%
352 chair recognizes representative
 
05:17:53.990 --> 05:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
borski for a motion thank you Mr
 
05:17:56.230 --> 05:17:56.240 align:start position:0%
chairman um I would like to make a
 
05:18:00.310 --> 05:18:00.320 align:start position:0%
motion to itl
 
05:18:02.750 --> 05:18:02.760 align:start position:0%
hb3 is there a
 
05:18:05.910 --> 05:18:05.920 align:start position:0%
second represent gag is a second wish to
 
05:18:07.628 --> 05:18:07.638 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion yes thank you Mr
 
05:18:10.830 --> 05:18:10.840 align:start position:0%
chairman um you know the spirit of uh
 
05:18:12.590 --> 05:18:12.600 align:start position:0%
352 I
 
05:18:14.750 --> 05:18:14.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate um where the representative
 
05:18:18.070 --> 05:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
was coming from in regards to um putting
 
05:18:20.150 --> 05:18:20.160 align:start position:0%
in some type of trading session but I
 
05:18:22.948 --> 05:18:22.958 align:start position:0%
sense that from you know reading this
 
05:18:25.788 --> 05:18:25.798 align:start position:0%
bill and hearing the testimony I think
 
05:18:28.270 --> 05:18:28.280 align:start position:0%
what we're doing is open up a p's box in
 
05:18:31.070 --> 05:18:31.080 align:start position:0%
terms of other things that you know we
 
05:18:32.628 --> 05:18:32.638 align:start position:0%
may eventually have to put on the pile
 
05:18:35.030 --> 05:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
to do special training on so I think we
 
05:18:38.830 --> 05:18:38.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:43.868 --> 05:18:43.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:47.030 --> 05:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
discussion seeing none oh sorry Mr
 
05:18:50.548 --> 05:18:50.558 align:start position:0%
chairman I was fumbling with fumbling
 
05:18:52.230 --> 05:18:52.240 align:start position:0%
with all these buttons to get out of
 
05:18:56.628 --> 05:18:56.638 align:start position:0%
mute and get the hand raised um I I
 
05:18:59.590 --> 05:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
would note that this um while I agree
 
05:19:02.030 --> 05:19:02.040 align:start position:0%
that this bill has a couple of issues
 
05:19:02.040 --> 05:19:03.670 align:start position:0%
that this bill has a couple of issues
specifically

05:19:03.670 --> 05:19:03.680 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
05:19:06.270 --> 05:19:06.280 align:start position:0%
um how would we deal with it in terms of
 
05:19:09.030 --> 05:19:09.040 align:start position:0%
endorsement language endorsements are in
 
05:19:11.430 --> 05:19:11.440 align:start position:0%
fact a a technique that is used
 
05:19:13.030 --> 05:19:13.040 align:start position:0%
throughout for many different types of
 
05:19:14.910 --> 05:19:14.920 align:start position:0%
licenses and also there was some
 
05:19:16.990 --> 05:19:17.000 align:start position:0%
concerns about clarifying the definition
 
05:19:18.868 --> 05:19:18.878 align:start position:0%
as the rsa's had a little bit of a
 
05:19:24.430 --> 05:19:24.440 align:start position:0%
problem um I I would be I I think this
 
05:19:26.628 --> 05:19:26.638 align:start position:0%
Bill had some Merit that we this is an
 
05:19:28.628 --> 05:19:28.638 align:start position:0%
example that we could have worked on by
 
05:19:30.628 --> 05:19:30.638 align:start position:0%
not executing it today but if we are
 
05:19:31.830 --> 05:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
going to EXE
 
05:19:31.840 --> 05:19:33.788 align:start position:0%
going to EXE
today

05:19:33.788 --> 05:19:33.798 align:start position:0%
today
 
05:19:36.750 --> 05:19:36.760 align:start position:0%
um I would I I would at this point be
 
05:19:38.750 --> 05:19:38.760 align:start position:0%
opposed to the itl and the chance that
 
05:19:42.230 --> 05:19:42.240 align:start position:0%
we could um either get it passed and fix
 
05:19:44.910 --> 05:19:44.920 align:start position:0%
those few things in the senate or retain
 
05:19:47.270 --> 05:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
it but uh at the moment I'm opposed to
 
05:19:47.280 --> 05:19:49.030 align:start position:0%
it but uh at the moment I'm opposed to
the

05:19:49.030 --> 05:19:49.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:19:52.310 --> 05:19:52.320 align:start position:0%
itl fair enough and I I'll also agree
 
05:19:53.868 --> 05:19:53.878 align:start position:0%
that there is some Merit to it I
 
05:19:55.430 --> 05:19:55.440 align:start position:0%
understand it although it was based on
 
05:19:58.310 --> 05:19:58.320 align:start position:0%
one accident one incident but I don't
 
05:19:59.948 --> 05:19:59.958 align:start position:0%
believe this this bill needs a little
 
05:20:02.030 --> 05:20:02.040 align:start position:0%
bit of work I think this bill needs a
 
05:20:04.310 --> 05:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
ton of work as confessed by the prime
 
05:20:06.310 --> 05:20:06.320 align:start position:0%
sponsor who said it's pretty much up to
 
05:20:07.708 --> 05:20:07.718 align:start position:0%
the committee what direction we want to
 
05:20:07.718 --> 05:20:08.670 align:start position:0%
the committee what direction we want to
go

05:20:08.670 --> 05:20:08.680 align:start position:0%
go
 
05:20:13.270 --> 05:20:13.280 align:start position:0%
in and you know what I I do agree we're
 
05:20:16.270 --> 05:20:16.280 align:start position:0%
raining a good amount of them already um
 
05:20:17.868 --> 05:20:17.878 align:start position:0%
I think this one is beyond what we could
 
05:20:20.910 --> 05:20:20.920 align:start position:0%
even do as uh in anything in
 
05:20:23.430 --> 05:20:23.440 align:start position:0%
retained I think if the pro Co I mean
 
05:20:25.590 --> 05:20:25.600 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsors really dead set on
 
05:20:27.670 --> 05:20:27.680 align:start position:0%
this uh some more work can be done on
 
05:20:30.350 --> 05:20:30.360 align:start position:0%
his end and reintroduced at a later time
 
05:20:36.270 --> 05:20:36.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:39.070 --> 05:20:39.080 align:start position:0%
itl well thank you for recognizing me I
 
05:20:41.150 --> 05:20:41.160 align:start position:0%
was going to suggest the motion to
 
05:20:45.350 --> 05:20:45.360 align:start position:0%
retain to work on it um I do think
 
05:20:48.430 --> 05:20:48.440 align:start position:0%
that that's okay I can if I may still
 
05:20:50.708 --> 05:20:50.718 align:start position:0%
share why I believe this is a good
 
05:20:53.350 --> 05:20:53.360 align:start position:0%
candidate for retention um I think it's
 
05:20:55.470 --> 05:20:55.480 align:start position:0%
something that has opened up the
 
05:20:57.830 --> 05:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
question of uh what New Hampshire could
 
05:20:59.510 --> 05:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
do to make sure that these vehicles are
 
05:21:02.070 --> 05:21:02.080 align:start position:0%
driven safely on our roads uh the fact
 
05:21:04.310 --> 05:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
that uh anyone can get into one of these
 
05:21:06.750 --> 05:21:06.760 align:start position:0%
vehicles um and and drive one of these
 
05:21:08.110 --> 05:21:08.120 align:start position:0%
massive things without any kind of
 
05:21:10.230 --> 05:21:10.240 align:start position:0%
training or experience I think is is
 
05:21:12.150 --> 05:21:12.160 align:start position:0%
quite problematic um I would have liked
 
05:21:14.190 --> 05:21:14.200 align:start position:0%
to have seen a retain motion where we
 
05:21:15.470 --> 05:21:15.480 align:start position:0%
could at least look at some of the
 
05:21:17.990 --> 05:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
issues and uh see how we could address
 
05:21:19.990 --> 05:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
them maybe not with an endorsement but
 
05:21:21.430 --> 05:21:21.440 align:start position:0%
to see if there was anything else such
 
05:21:23.590 --> 05:21:23.600 align:start position:0%
as a a training program or something
 
05:21:28.270 --> 05:21:28.280 align:start position:0%
similar um but yes I I I'm afraid that
 
05:21:31.150 --> 05:21:31.160 align:start position:0%
um going straight to the itl um I am not
 
05:21:32.830 --> 05:21:32.840 align:start position:0%
favor of thank
 
05:21:37.590 --> 05:21:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:40.110 --> 05:21:40.120 align:start position:0%

352 let me know if you want to do a
 
05:22:50.110 --> 05:22:50.120 align:start position:0%
Minority Report I will let you know Mr
 
05:22:51.830 --> 05:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
chairman I'm gonna see if I can Farm it
 
05:22:53.310 --> 05:22:53.320 align:start position:0%
out if there's going to be one though I
 
05:22:55.150 --> 05:22:55.160 align:start position:0%
don't want to take on all of
 
05:22:58.310 --> 05:22:58.320 align:start position:0%
them I have may I ask a question just on
 
05:23:01.070 --> 05:23:01.080 align:start position:0%
procedure if there's a Minority Report
 
05:23:04.470 --> 05:23:04.480 align:start position:0%
um I believe the minority's um motion
 
05:23:06.190 --> 05:23:06.200 align:start position:0%
would have been to retain can we still
 
05:23:07.708 --> 05:23:07.718 align:start position:0%
write a Minority Report with that as our
 
05:23:10.708 --> 05:23:10.718 align:start position:0%
suggested motion or don't see why not
 
05:23:11.868 --> 05:23:11.878 align:start position:0%
that that's your that's the motion
 
05:23:13.830 --> 05:23:13.840 align:start position:0%
you're seeking as a minority so
 
05:23:16.590 --> 05:23:16.600 align:start position:0%
yes okay I'll discuss it with um the
 
05:23:18.430 --> 05:23:18.440 align:start position:0%
ranking I would just yeah I would check
 
05:23:20.628 --> 05:23:20.638 align:start position:0%
with the clerk because I'm not sure that
 
05:23:23.628 --> 05:23:23.638 align:start position:0%
what'll happen was if if we if we
 
05:23:25.830 --> 05:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
overturn the committee's report that the
 
05:23:27.548 --> 05:23:27.558 align:start position:0%
the next motion I think would have to be
 
05:23:30.230 --> 05:23:30.240 align:start position:0%
OTP the house does not have a retained
 
05:23:32.070 --> 05:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
motion does it
 
05:23:34.708 --> 05:23:34.718 align:start position:0%
have a quasy parliamentarian here do you
 
05:23:34.718 --> 05:23:38.830 align:start position:0%
have a quasy parliamentarian here do you
hear

05:23:38.830 --> 05:23:38.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:41.230 --> 05:23:41.240 align:start position:0%
that would it have to be I'll check with
 
05:23:43.430 --> 05:23:43.440 align:start position:0%
the clerk you can do retain because I
 
05:23:46.590 --> 05:23:46.600 align:start position:0%
mean on the floor you could do refer
 
05:23:50.548 --> 05:23:50.558 align:start position:0%
refer no so yeah okay yeah go go with
 
05:23:51.990 --> 05:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
the retainer they'll tell us if we're
 
05:23:53.868 --> 05:23:53.878 align:start position:0%
Rong all right we'll we'll check with
 
05:23:55.548 --> 05:23:55.558 align:start position:0%
the clerk and then we'll we'll make some
 
05:23:57.708 --> 05:23:57.718 align:start position:0%

05:23:57.718 --> 05:23:59.510 align:start position:0%

05:25:32.190 --> 05:25:32.200 align:start position:0%
motion um thank you chair I would uh I
 
05:25:35.910 --> 05:25:35.920 align:start position:0%
would like to move retain on House Bill
 
05:25:39.628 --> 05:25:39.638 align:start position:0%
435 435 correct is there a second second
 
05:25:39.638 --> 05:25:40.590 align:start position:0%
435 435 correct is there a second second
by

05:25:40.590 --> 05:25:40.600 align:start position:0%
by
 
05:25:42.910 --> 05:25:42.920 align:start position:0%
represent Mr speak your
 
05:25:47.270 --> 05:25:47.280 align:start position:0%
motion um sure briefly um I would just
 
05:25:51.590 --> 05:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
like to say that I I was sensitive to
 
05:25:54.350 --> 05:25:54.360 align:start position:0%
director B's comments I thought she made
 
05:25:55.788 --> 05:25:55.798 align:start position:0%
some cogent
 
05:25:59.230 --> 05:25:59.240 align:start position:0%
points uh of problems within this bill
 
05:26:01.590 --> 05:26:01.600 align:start position:0%
that uh I think can be
 
05:26:03.830 --> 05:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
um addressed and I thought I think it
 
05:26:05.708 --> 05:26:05.718 align:start position:0%
behooves us to retain the bill and
 
05:26:13.548 --> 05:26:13.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:17.230 --> 05:26:17.240 align:start position:0%
DMV yeah I'd just like to get a moment a
 
05:26:19.390 --> 05:26:19.400 align:start position:0%
bit of a clarification my notes show
 
05:26:23.070 --> 05:26:23.080 align:start position:0%
that director blei was uh essentially
 
05:26:25.150 --> 05:26:25.160 align:start position:0%
neutral she said they were neutral on
 
05:26:28.430 --> 05:26:28.440 align:start position:0%
this bill and that she did have a small
 
05:26:31.910 --> 05:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
concern that would go back to the court
 
05:26:34.548 --> 05:26:34.558 align:start position:0%
but um I will point out that when this
 
05:26:37.670 --> 05:26:37.680 align:start position:0%
bill was originally written
 
05:26:41.190 --> 05:26:41.200 align:start position:0%
um it came out of committee last year 20
 
05:26:43.750 --> 05:26:43.760 align:start position:0%
to nothing and went to the floor of the
 
05:26:46.310 --> 05:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
house and a a Voice vote passed that and
 
05:26:47.948 --> 05:26:47.958 align:start position:0%
was referred to criminal justice and
 
05:26:50.990 --> 05:26:51.000 align:start position:0%
then died in the the uh the rest of the
 
05:26:54.990 --> 05:26:55.000 align:start position:0%
session but I don't I believe that the
 
05:26:57.030 --> 05:26:57.040 align:start position:0%
the question that she raised was more
 
05:26:59.070 --> 05:26:59.080 align:start position:0%
from her not being familiar with the
 
05:27:02.150 --> 05:27:02.160 align:start position:0%
answer rather than the fact that the the
 
05:27:04.948 --> 05:27:04.958 align:start position:0%
courts did answer this very these very
 
05:27:09.910 --> 05:27:09.920 align:start position:0%
same questions and so uh again I I will
 
05:27:11.750 --> 05:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
just make note of my objection to
 
05:27:13.548 --> 05:27:13.558 align:start position:0%
executing bills on the same day but in
 
05:27:18.390 --> 05:27:18.400 align:start position:0%
the meantime um I am proba I guess I'm
 
05:27:20.230 --> 05:27:20.240 align:start position:0%
opposed to retaining yet another bill
 
05:27:22.470 --> 05:27:22.480 align:start position:0%
that has lots of Merit that we could
 
05:27:25.270 --> 05:27:25.280 align:start position:0%
move forward in the process thank
 
05:27:28.350 --> 05:27:28.360 align:start position:0%
you any further
 
05:27:31.270 --> 05:27:31.280 align:start position:0%
discussion I'll just say this uh
 
05:27:33.470 --> 05:27:33.480 align:start position:0%
closing um I do remember that we all
 
05:27:34.788 --> 05:27:34.798 align:start position:0%
voted for this last year I don't
 
05:27:36.910 --> 05:27:36.920 align:start position:0%
remember these issues coming up last
 
05:27:39.430 --> 05:27:39.440 align:start position:0%
year and quite frankly last year was
 
05:27:41.190 --> 05:27:41.200 align:start position:0%
last year now that these issues are
 
05:27:43.110 --> 05:27:43.120 align:start position:0%
before us they were brought up by
 
05:27:44.788 --> 05:27:44.798 align:start position:0%
probably the most trustworthy department
 
05:27:47.948 --> 05:27:47.958 align:start position:0%
head I know of um I think the retain is
 
05:27:49.510 --> 05:27:49.520 align:start position:0%
the perfect thing to do with this the
 
05:27:52.070 --> 05:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
questions were not small they rain to
 
05:27:54.628 --> 05:27:54.638 align:start position:0%
the Judiciary and judicial answers I
 
05:27:55.670 --> 05:27:55.680 align:start position:0%
think it's the best thing to do with
 
05:27:58.230 --> 05:27:58.240 align:start position:0%
this to keep it alive um I'd encourage
 
05:28:01.750 --> 05:28:01.760 align:start position:0%
everybody on the committee to
 
05:28:01.760 --> 05:28:05.990 align:start position:0%
everybody on the committee to
any

05:28:05.990 --> 05:28:06.000 align:start position:0%

one two three
four

05:29:31.270 --> 05:29:31.280 align:start position:0%
four
 
05:29:33.910 --> 05:29:33.920 align:start position:0%
five bills
 
05:29:36.948 --> 05:29:36.958 align:start position:0%
left two of the I know have amendments
 
05:29:39.788 --> 05:29:39.798 align:start position:0%
that I don't believe everybody has it's
 
05:29:42.310 --> 05:29:42.320 align:start position:0%
20 minutes to three
 
05:29:45.270 --> 05:29:45.280 align:start position:0%
now I call just a short recess until 20
 
05:29:48.708 --> 05:29:48.718 align:start position:0%
minutes to three wait hold on before you
 
05:29:51.310 --> 05:29:51.320 align:start position:0%
recess the house clerk reports that
 
05:29:54.628 --> 05:29:54.638 align:start position:0%
retain cannot be a Minority Report
 
05:29:57.948 --> 05:29:57.958 align:start position:0%
because it isn't a report of the house
 
05:30:01.788 --> 05:30:01.798 align:start position:0%
to vote on right did you catch
 
05:30:04.708 --> 05:30:04.718 align:start position:0%
that can representative Smith can you
 
05:30:07.230 --> 05:30:07.240 align:start position:0%
please say that um closer or slower to a
 
05:30:09.788 --> 05:30:09.798 align:start position:0%
microphone I just didn't catch it all
 
05:30:12.948 --> 05:30:12.958 align:start position:0%
yeah be because a motion to retain is a
 
05:30:15.708 --> 05:30:15.718 align:start position:0%
committee motion the house never moves
 
05:30:18.510 --> 05:30:18.520 align:start position:0%
for a committee to retain a bill and we
 
05:30:21.948 --> 05:30:21.958 align:start position:0%
we have to adopt the report so instead
 
05:30:25.510 --> 05:30:25.520 align:start position:0%
you would have to do OTP or something or
 
05:30:29.230 --> 05:30:29.240 align:start position:0%
do a floor motion to reer it to
 
05:30:33.470 --> 05:30:33.480 align:start position:0%
committee so the minority can't be
 
05:30:35.990 --> 05:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
retained okay and you cannot have
 
05:30:38.670 --> 05:30:38.680 align:start position:0%
re-refer as a motion on The Minority
 
05:30:41.350 --> 05:30:41.360 align:start position:0%
Report you can do that on the house
 
05:30:43.670 --> 05:30:43.680 align:start position:0%
floor if that's what you want to
 
05:30:46.868 --> 05:30:46.878 align:start position:0%
do okay but your Minority Report would
 
05:30:50.868 --> 05:30:50.878 align:start position:0%
have to be you know someh house Mo for
 
05:30:57.110 --> 05:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:00.910 --> 05:31:00.920 align:start position:0%
that so in this case the OTP is the best
 
05:31:05.868 --> 05:31:05.878 align:start position:0%
fit for what I'm trying to do yeah thank
 
05:31:08.390 --> 05:31:08.400 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman what time were you going
 
05:31:12.070 --> 05:31:12.080 align:start position:0%
to um I think recess to I think three
 
05:31:13.548 --> 05:31:13.558 align:start position:0%
o'clock would be fine that's enough time
 
05:31:14.708 --> 05:31:14.718 align:start position:0%
I've got to dig up a couple of
 
05:31:16.350 --> 05:31:16.360 align:start position:0%
amendments I think there's a few few
 
05:31:18.470 --> 05:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
others to send it a whole
 
05:31:20.590 --> 05:31:20.600 align:start position:0%
committee and uh we got five of the
 
05:31:22.788 --> 05:31:22.798 align:start position:0%
bills after that we're we're in pretty
 
05:31:25.430 --> 05:31:25.440 align:start position:0%
good shape so all right so I'm gonna
 
05:31:27.230 --> 05:31:27.240 align:start position:0%
just just while I get everybody's
 
05:31:29.110 --> 05:31:29.120 align:start position:0%

during testimony uh Joseph kalal kalala
 
06:10:36.948 --> 06:10:36.958 align:start position:0%
from the juvenile products manufacturing
 
06:10:39.110 --> 06:10:39.120 align:start position:0%
association had a concern this amendment
 
06:10:41.430 --> 06:10:41.440 align:start position:0%
answers that concern and then
 
06:10:45.190 --> 06:10:45.200 align:start position:0%
furthermore it also takes care of the uh
 
06:10:47.510 --> 06:10:47.520 align:start position:0%
effective date and so I would urge
 
06:10:49.230 --> 06:10:49.240 align:start position:0%
members of the committee to vote in
 
06:10:51.468 --> 06:10:51.478 align:start position:0%

Mr chairman um could you tell me whether
 
06:11:02.110 --> 06:11:02.120 align:start position:0%
the amendments deal with which safety
 
06:11:05.468 --> 06:11:05.478 align:start position:0%
um agreements we're using in it the
 
06:11:08.548 --> 06:11:08.558 align:start position:0%
original Bill had talked about safety
 
06:11:12.390 --> 06:11:12.400 align:start position:0%
standards um does the amendment change
 
06:11:16.350 --> 06:11:16.360 align:start position:0%
that or delineate or explain which
 
06:11:18.350 --> 06:11:18.360 align:start position:0%
safety standards we're using are you
 
06:11:21.150 --> 06:11:21.160 align:start position:0%
asking that of me or yes I am okay the
 
06:11:23.150 --> 06:11:23.160 align:start position:0%
way I understand it the same the
 
06:11:24.750 --> 06:11:24.760 align:start position:0%
standards that referred to and I don't
 
06:11:26.708 --> 06:11:26.718 align:start position:0%
have it in front of them that's for my
 
06:11:29.948 --> 06:11:29.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:32.270 --> 06:11:32.280 align:start position:0%
too and actually if you can do a better
 
06:11:34.430 --> 06:11:34.440 align:start position:0%
job of this than I represent Donovan you
 
06:11:37.750 --> 06:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:40.390 --> 06:11:40.400 align:start position:0%
In um yeah be happy to talk about this
 
06:11:41.468 --> 06:11:41.478 align:start position:0%
and thank you to the question that's a
 
06:11:44.948 --> 06:11:44.958 align:start position:0%
great um issue to bring up so it's the
 
06:11:46.468 --> 06:11:46.478 align:start position:0%
the the issue is um that you're
 
06:11:48.110 --> 06:11:48.120 align:start position:0%
referring to probably is the the last
 
06:11:49.708 --> 06:11:49.718 align:start position:0%
sentence of the bill basically says in
 
06:11:52.310 --> 06:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
accordance with safety standards so if
 
06:11:54.830 --> 06:11:54.840 align:start position:0%
you look at the the bill what the safety
 
06:11:57.868 --> 06:11:57.878 align:start position:0%
standards are referring to is um United
 
06:11:59.788 --> 06:11:59.798 align:start position:0%
States Department of Transportation
 
06:12:04.990 --> 06:12:05.000 align:start position:0%
section 213 so the the bill States um
 
06:12:06.910 --> 06:12:06.920 align:start position:0%
that in accordance with safety standards
 
06:12:09.750 --> 06:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
approved by United States Department of
 
06:12:13.670 --> 06:12:13.680 align:start position:0%
Transportation in 49 CFR section 571
 
06:12:16.628 --> 06:12:16.638 align:start position:0%
2113 so that's just reab brevia it just
 
06:12:19.948 --> 06:12:19.958 align:start position:0%
so that there's no uh issues that that's
 
06:12:22.310 --> 06:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
the safety standards were're referring
 
06:12:24.510 --> 06:12:24.520 align:start position:0%
to and chairman Walsh if you think I
 
06:12:26.990 --> 06:12:27.000 align:start position:0%
missed something feel free to yeah well
 
06:12:28.708 --> 06:12:28.718 align:start position:0%
now the only I appreciate about the
 
06:12:31.548 --> 06:12:31.558 align:start position:0%
amendment is it also simplifies it to if
 
06:12:33.510 --> 06:12:33.520 align:start position:0%
you look at the original bill um that's
 
06:12:34.788 --> 06:12:34.798 align:start position:0%
where we get into the weeds when we
 
06:12:36.510 --> 06:12:36.520 align:start position:0%
start talking about inches and weights
 
06:12:38.350 --> 06:12:38.360 align:start position:0%
and pounds and all this stuff that was
 
06:12:42.190 --> 06:12:42.200 align:start position:0%
taken out uh the reference to uh 49 CFR
 
06:12:43.788 --> 06:12:43.798 align:start position:0%
basically section
 
06:12:46.830 --> 06:12:46.840 align:start position:0%
213 that would apply to paragraph 1 C as
 
06:12:49.070 --> 06:12:49.080 align:start position:0%
well the way I interpret
 
06:12:51.070 --> 06:12:51.080 align:start position:0%
it I
 
06:12:53.390 --> 06:12:53.400 align:start position:0%
would I would encourage everybody to
 
06:12:55.350 --> 06:12:55.360 align:start position:0%

06:15:10.190 --> 06:15:10.200 align:start position:0%
motion I just wanted to put my two cents
 
06:15:13.708 --> 06:15:13.718 align:start position:0%
in here as a mother and um
 
06:15:16.430 --> 06:15:16.440 align:start position:0%
having lots of contact with the way
 
06:15:17.990 --> 06:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
parents either understand how to use
 
06:15:20.350 --> 06:15:20.360 align:start position:0%
their car seats or not I think that this
 
06:15:23.070 --> 06:15:23.080 align:start position:0%
bill is a long time coming that will be
 
06:15:26.230 --> 06:15:26.240 align:start position:0%
a good educational opportunity that will
 
06:15:30.030 --> 06:15:30.040 align:start position:0%
protect children and um I truly believe
 
06:15:33.390 --> 06:15:33.400 align:start position:0%
that one harmed child is one too many in
 
06:15:35.628 --> 06:15:35.638 align:start position:0%
our state and I would urge the committee
 
06:15:40.310 --> 06:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
to please support uh 251 as
 
06:15:42.230 --> 06:15:42.240 align:start position:0%

Mr
 
06:15:49.110 --> 06:15:49.120 align:start position:0%
chair I want to know I want to say that
 
06:15:51.150 --> 06:15:51.160 align:start position:0%
I believe in safety and I also believe
 
06:15:52.468 --> 06:15:52.478 align:start position:0%
in parental
 
06:15:55.110 --> 06:15:55.120 align:start position:0%
rights uh and parents right to choose
 
06:15:57.150 --> 06:15:57.160 align:start position:0%
what restraint system works best for
 
06:15:58.548 --> 06:15:58.558 align:start position:0%
their child along with their
 
06:16:01.430 --> 06:16:01.440 align:start position:0%
pediatrician advice parents I've spoken
 
06:16:04.310 --> 06:16:04.320 align:start position:0%
to don't want any more State mandates
 
06:16:06.948 --> 06:16:06.958 align:start position:0%
some kids get car sick rear-facing some
 
06:16:09.110 --> 06:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
kids have long legs some kids need to
 
06:16:12.390 --> 06:16:12.400 align:start position:0%
see their parents there's been no major
 
06:16:14.390 --> 06:16:14.400 align:start position:0%
problem with kids dying or getting
 
06:16:17.030 --> 06:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
injured and using incorrect restraints
 
06:16:19.750 --> 06:16:19.760 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and the current US
 
06:16:22.468 --> 06:16:22.478 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation puts out a
 
06:16:24.910 --> 06:16:24.920 align:start position:0%
chart that shows that there's an overlap
 
06:16:27.910 --> 06:16:27.920 align:start position:0%
between the recommend recommendations
 
06:16:30.670 --> 06:16:30.680 align:start position:0%
for rear-facing use which is one to
 
06:16:33.510 --> 06:16:33.520 align:start position:0%
three years and forward-facing use which
 
06:16:37.310 --> 06:16:37.320 align:start position:0%
is 18 months years and booster seat used
 
06:16:40.390 --> 06:16:40.400 align:start position:0%
from four years to 12 years old I
 
06:16:42.750 --> 06:16:42.760 align:start position:0%
believe our law already covers proper
 
06:16:45.110 --> 06:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
Mandate of requiring child restraints
 
06:16:46.948 --> 06:16:46.958 align:start position:0%
and we don't need to mandate anything
 
06:16:48.910 --> 06:16:48.920 align:start position:0%
further and I think we should leave
 
06:16:51.990 --> 06:16:52.000 align:start position:0%
restraint usage decisions of to parents
 
06:16:54.990 --> 06:16:55.000 align:start position:0%
whose number one concern is their child
 
06:16:57.468 --> 06:16:57.478 align:start position:0%
safety should work with their
 
06:17:00.670 --> 06:17:00.680 align:start position:0%
pediatrician and um and and determine
 
06:17:03.590 --> 06:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
what works best for them I've spoken to
 
06:17:06.390 --> 06:17:06.400 align:start position:0%
many of my own constituents and this was
 
06:17:09.350 --> 06:17:09.360 align:start position:0%

the numbers of organizations and folks
 
06:21:31.548 --> 06:21:31.558 align:start position:0%
who spoke in support of this bill was
 
06:21:36.468 --> 06:21:36.478 align:start position:0%
heavily weighted in favor from the um
 
06:21:40.390 --> 06:21:40.400 align:start position:0%
for instance Dan Goodman of triaa um who
 
06:21:42.548 --> 06:21:42.558 align:start position:0%
was in opposition to the bill I I should
 
06:21:44.390 --> 06:21:44.400 align:start position:0%
say the people were opposed to the bill
 
06:21:47.150 --> 06:21:47.160 align:start position:0%
to be clear clear about that um Dan
 
06:21:48.990 --> 06:21:49.000 align:start position:0%

06:22:09.310 --> 06:22:09.320 align:start position:0%
um not you know sometimes it's really
 
06:22:11.390 --> 06:22:11.400 align:start position:0%
important that we listen to the
 
06:22:13.390 --> 06:22:13.400 align:start position:0%
professionals who have studied the
 
06:22:16.750 --> 06:22:16.760 align:start position:0%
issues and we know that um I've not
 
06:22:20.548 --> 06:22:20.558 align:start position:0%
heard or seen anything about actual data
 
06:22:22.468 --> 06:22:22.478 align:start position:0%
that proves that people are having
 
06:22:25.230 --> 06:22:25.240 align:start position:0%
trouble getting their driver's licenses
 
06:22:27.430 --> 06:22:27.440 align:start position:0%
but I have in fact seen data that shows
 
06:22:29.830 --> 06:22:29.840 align:start position:0%
that we have a relatively good driving
 
06:22:32.468 --> 06:22:32.478 align:start position:0%
records in terms of training people and
 
06:22:33.590 --> 06:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
uh we should
 
06:22:38.708 --> 06:22:38.718 align:start position:0%

06:22:42.190 --> 06:22:42.200 align:start position:0%

chair
 
06:22:47.628 --> 06:22:47.638 align:start position:0%
um I would vote to pass this bill simply
 
06:22:50.110 --> 06:22:50.120 align:start position:0%
because as a parent who has taught their
 
06:22:53.990 --> 06:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
children to drive um and they have done
 
06:22:55.990 --> 06:22:56.000 align:start position:0%
very well for themselves
 
06:22:58.190 --> 06:22:58.200 align:start position:0%
never gotten into any accidents they are
 
06:23:01.708 --> 06:23:01.718 align:start position:0%
good drivers I think parents are totally
 
06:23:04.670 --> 06:23:04.680 align:start position:0%
and Guardians uh responsible adults are
 
06:23:06.430 --> 06:23:06.440 align:start position:0%
quite capable of teaching their children
 
06:23:09.670 --> 06:23:09.680 align:start position:0%
to drive and again I think this is a
 
06:23:12.750 --> 06:23:12.760 align:start position:0%
parental rights issue I think parents
 
06:23:15.628 --> 06:23:15.638 align:start position:0%
should be given the option to be able to
 
06:23:17.628 --> 06:23:17.638 align:start position:0%
uh to engage in teaching their children
 
06:23:21.708 --> 06:23:21.718 align:start position:0%
to drive so that's where I
 
06:23:24.468 --> 06:23:24.478 align:start position:0%
this represent the last
 
06:23:24.478 --> 06:23:26.110 align:start position:0%
this represent the last
speakers

06:23:26.110 --> 06:23:26.120 align:start position:0%
speakers
 
06:23:28.310 --> 06:23:28.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um one of my
 
06:23:30.670 --> 06:23:30.680 align:start position:0%
biggest issues I have with this bill is
 
06:23:35.830 --> 06:23:35.840 align:start position:0%
the fact that there's um no specific way
 
06:23:40.750 --> 06:23:40.760 align:start position:0%
to determine if the education was given
 
06:23:43.628 --> 06:23:43.638 align:start position:0%
in the same level um as a driver's
 
06:23:46.070 --> 06:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
education program um never mind there's
 
06:23:48.030 --> 06:23:48.040 align:start position:0%
no way to determine that any education
 
06:23:51.948 --> 06:23:51.958 align:start position:0%
was given um it just has someone signing
 
06:23:54.430 --> 06:23:54.440 align:start position:0%
an affidavit I believe is what the
 
06:23:56.350 --> 06:23:56.360 align:start position:0%
process is submit proof there's no
 
06:23:58.310 --> 06:23:58.320 align:start position:0%
definition of what submit proof is I
 
06:24:00.910 --> 06:24:00.920 align:start position:0%
have a problem with that um if this even
 
06:24:02.310 --> 06:24:02.320 align:start position:0%
was going to be something I would
 
06:24:04.310 --> 06:24:04.320 align:start position:0%
entertain I would need a lot more
 
06:24:08.390 --> 06:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
details um in there to ensure that um
 
06:24:10.350 --> 06:24:10.360 align:start position:0%
the drivers who are coming onto our
 
06:24:13.150 --> 06:24:13.160 align:start position:0%
roadways were going to be trained in the
 
06:24:15.468 --> 06:24:15.478 align:start position:0%
manner equal to all of the other young
 
06:24:18.310 --> 06:24:18.320 align:start position:0%
drivers in our state so um I will be
 
06:24:22.270 --> 06:24:22.280 align:start position:0%
supporting the itl thank you thank you
 
06:24:24.350 --> 06:24:24.360 align:start position:0%
any further discussion from
 
06:24:27.708 --> 06:24:27.718 align:start position:0%
the representative Crawford I'll make it
 
06:24:33.350 --> 06:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
sure so um I'm with the itl and um the
 
06:24:35.350 --> 06:24:35.360 align:start position:0%
bill doesn't
 
06:24:38.868 --> 06:24:38.878 align:start position:0%
specify um the cost that it would uh I
 
06:24:43.468 --> 06:24:43.478 align:start position:0%
believe um director uh the director of
 
06:24:45.390 --> 06:24:45.400 align:start position:0%
Motor Vehicles said that there certainly
 
06:24:48.110 --> 06:24:48.120 align:start position:0%
would need U more Personnel to look at
 
06:24:50.990 --> 06:24:51.000 align:start position:0%
all of these waivers you're asking a a
 
06:24:53.670 --> 06:24:53.680 align:start position:0%
mother a father a guardian or knows who
 
06:24:56.190 --> 06:24:56.200 align:start position:0%
are responsible adult is to teach 30
 
06:24:58.430 --> 06:24:58.440 align:start position:0%
hours of classroom 10 hours behind the
 
06:25:01.310 --> 06:25:01.320 align:start position:0%
wheel instruction six hours of
 
06:25:03.548 --> 06:25:03.558 align:start position:0%
observation there are no Provisions in
 
06:25:05.750 --> 06:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
this bill to have a supervision of the
 
06:25:08.548 --> 06:25:08.558 align:start position:0%
instruction being taught driver ed
 
06:25:10.430 --> 06:25:10.440 align:start position:0%
presently is taught by licensed
 
06:25:12.910 --> 06:25:12.920 align:start position:0%
instructors who are required college
 
06:25:15.270 --> 06:25:15.280 align:start position:0%
credits 51 hour and staff development
 
06:25:19.390 --> 06:25:19.400 align:start position:0%
hours every three years we basically um
 
06:25:21.510 --> 06:25:21.520 align:start position:0%
are supervised by the department of
 
06:25:24.350 --> 06:25:24.360 align:start position:0%
safety and this is basically we have to
 
06:25:26.310 --> 06:25:26.320 align:start position:0%
get a do physical I mean there's a lot
 
06:25:28.430 --> 06:25:28.440 align:start position:0%
to it I'm not saying that parents don't
 
06:25:30.948 --> 06:25:30.958 align:start position:0%
do a halfway decent job in teaching
 
06:25:33.310 --> 06:25:33.320 align:start position:0%
their kids before we get to them but I
 
06:25:35.190 --> 06:25:35.200 align:start position:0%
will tell you for the first three
 
06:25:37.390 --> 06:25:37.400 align:start position:0%
lessons maybe I'm correcting all the
 
06:25:40.310 --> 06:25:40.320 align:start position:0%
mistakes that parents make so I would I
 
06:25:45.070 --> 06:25:45.080 align:start position:0%
I don't see um the validity of it and I
 
06:25:47.670 --> 06:25:47.680 align:start position:0%
I don't believe that we should put that
 
06:25:50.230 --> 06:25:50.240 align:start position:0%
on parents I mean we got good parents
 
06:25:52.310 --> 06:25:52.320 align:start position:0%
and we have not so good parents so I
 
06:25:54.190 --> 06:25:54.200 align:start position:0%
will leave it at
 
06:25:58.628 --> 06:25:58.638 align:start position:0%
that representative CER yes I agree with
 
06:26:03.070 --> 06:26:03.080 align:start position:0%
what clerk just stated what she said be
 
06:26:05.830 --> 06:26:05.840 align:start position:0%
okay with it some parents will be very
 
06:26:09.390 --> 06:26:09.400 align:start position:0%
very good at it most will not and will
 
06:26:12.788 --> 06:26:12.798 align:start position:0%
not document and and go to the extent
 
06:26:15.110 --> 06:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
possible uh with our train driver
 
06:26:17.948 --> 06:26:17.958 align:start position:0%
education programs I think we have good
 
06:26:20.990 --> 06:26:21.000 align:start position:0%
programs they they're certified the
 
06:26:23.430 --> 06:26:23.440 align:start position:0%
instruction is great whether it's
 
06:26:25.230 --> 06:26:25.240 align:start position:0%
private schools or high school or what
 
06:26:27.948 --> 06:26:27.958 align:start position:0%
whatever and I think that we ought to
 
06:26:31.030 --> 06:26:31.040 align:start position:0%
itl this bill and and uh keep safety at
 
06:26:31.040 --> 06:26:32.990 align:start position:0%
itl this bill and and uh keep safety at
a

06:26:32.990 --> 06:26:33.000 align:start position:0%
a
 
06:26:35.230 --> 06:26:35.240 align:start position:0%
standard representative Stevens is that
 
06:26:38.468 --> 06:26:38.478 align:start position:0%
your hand raised yes sir thank you Mr
 
06:26:42.830 --> 06:26:42.840 align:start position:0%
chair um in regards to the parents I
 
06:26:47.230 --> 06:26:47.240 align:start position:0%
heard from and I felt badly about this
 
06:26:48.510 --> 06:26:48.520 align:start position:0%
part of the
 
06:26:53.990 --> 06:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
reality um when the financial burden of
 
06:26:58.510 --> 06:26:58.520 align:start position:0%
the cost of driver had came up and
 
06:27:01.590 --> 06:27:01.600 align:start position:0%
certainly if you have more than one
 
06:27:04.110 --> 06:27:04.120 align:start position:0%
child that you're trying to get on the
 
06:27:06.110 --> 06:27:06.120 align:start position:0%
road that's a lot of
 
06:27:10.230 --> 06:27:10.240 align:start position:0%
money but what the reality is is if what
 
06:27:10.240 --> 06:27:11.270 align:start position:0%
money but what the reality is is if what
you

06:27:11.270 --> 06:27:11.280 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:27:16.150 --> 06:27:16.160 align:start position:0%
lose is the insurance discount so I'm
 
06:27:20.468 --> 06:27:20.478 align:start position:0%
not sure which side of the financial
 
06:27:24.110 --> 06:27:24.120 align:start position:0%
fence that falls in favor of
 
06:27:28.350 --> 06:27:28.360 align:start position:0%
but it's not as if teaching your child
 
06:27:32.830 --> 06:27:32.840 align:start position:0%
gets you a financial
 
06:27:37.150 --> 06:27:37.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:37.160 --> 06:27:40.190 align:start position:0%

Smith thank you Mr chair there's a
 
06:27:49.830 --> 06:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
section missing from the
 
06:27:54.110 --> 06:27:54.120 align:start position:0%
bill so responsible adults not defined
 
06:27:55.468 --> 06:27:55.478 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of other things there it's
 
06:27:57.030 --> 06:27:57.040 align:start position:0%
kind of a vague paragraph the new
 
06:27:59.430 --> 06:27:59.440 align:start position:0%
paragraph section five and we did not
 
06:28:02.468 --> 06:28:02.478 align:start position:0%
include afterwards the um Power of the
 
06:28:04.230 --> 06:28:04.240 align:start position:0%
department who adopt rules so they can
 
06:28:06.070 --> 06:28:06.080 align:start position:0%
actually do this normally there would be
 
06:28:08.310 --> 06:28:08.320 align:start position:0%
a section that follows that says the
 
06:28:10.270 --> 06:28:10.280 align:start position:0%
commissioner May adopt rules pursuant to
 
06:28:12.548 --> 06:28:12.558 align:start position:0%

track also I just wanted to clarify
 
06:30:35.590 --> 06:30:35.600 align:start position:0%
because I thought representative Smith
 
06:30:37.030 --> 06:30:37.040 align:start position:0%
said he was going to be voting for The
 
06:30:40.590 --> 06:30:40.600 align:start position:0%
itl and then he verbally voted against
 
06:30:42.548 --> 06:30:42.558 align:start position:0%
it that is
 
06:30:47.590 --> 06:30:47.600 align:start position:0%

Sykes thank you Mr chairman um unless it
 
06:42:04.750 --> 06:42:04.760 align:start position:0%
could be that my notes are incorrect but
 
06:42:08.030 --> 06:42:08.040 align:start position:0%
I what I have in my notes is that at the
 
06:42:09.708 --> 06:42:09.718 align:start position:0%
public hearing for this bill which
 
06:42:12.590 --> 06:42:12.600 align:start position:0%
occurred on the 12th of February other
 
06:42:14.670 --> 06:42:14.680 align:start position:0%
than the prime sponsor representative
 
06:42:17.468 --> 06:42:17.478 align:start position:0%
gay no one spoke in favor of this bill
 
06:42:21.030 --> 06:42:21.040 align:start position:0%
although the DMV was neutral
 
06:42:24.468 --> 06:42:24.478 align:start position:0%
um I we heard a lot of concern from many
 
06:42:27.468 --> 06:42:27.478 align:start position:0%
different citizens groups that spoke
 
06:42:31.190 --> 06:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
about the discriminatory nature of this
 
06:42:35.750 --> 06:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
uh this bill and I am I I I believe
 
06:42:39.350 --> 06:42:39.360 align:start position:0%
strongly that the the general public um
 
06:42:42.310 --> 06:42:42.320 align:start position:0%
as evidence by the the uh testimony
 
06:42:45.388 --> 06:42:45.398 align:start position:0%
given to us are opposed to the B the
 
06:42:48.310 --> 06:42:48.320 align:start position:0%
bill and I don't believe that we want
 
06:42:51.150 --> 06:42:51.160 align:start position:0%
would want to go on record as being uh
 
06:42:52.788 --> 06:42:52.798 align:start position:0%
in support of something that would be
 
06:42:56.990 --> 06:42:57.000 align:start position:0%
discriminatory towards individuals um
 
06:42:59.430 --> 06:42:59.440 align:start position:0%
the one issue that the DMV did bring up
 
06:43:01.310 --> 06:43:01.320 align:start position:0%
was that they were concerned about the
 
06:43:02.990 --> 06:43:03.000 align:start position:0%
limited real estate on the driver's
 
06:43:06.708 --> 06:43:06.718 align:start position:0%
license and it was not clear um how or
 
06:43:10.270 --> 06:43:10.280 align:start position:0%
where this this indication would would
 
06:43:12.590 --> 06:43:12.600 align:start position:0%
end up on the card on the on the
 
06:43:16.830 --> 06:43:16.840 align:start position:0%
driver's license and so I'm going to uh
 
06:43:20.070 --> 06:43:20.080 align:start position:0%
request that the committee itl this bill
 
06:43:22.910 --> 06:43:22.920 align:start position:0%
and not not be in support of the motion
 
06:43:25.548 --> 06:43:25.558 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:43:29.628 --> 06:43:29.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:33.310 --> 06:43:33.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:37.270 --> 06:43:37.280 align:start position:0%
tar thank you very much Mr chairman um I
 
06:43:41.230 --> 06:43:41.240 align:start position:0%
want to Echo um representative Sykes in
 
06:43:44.468 --> 06:43:44.478 align:start position:0%
his statement of um support that we saw
 
06:43:48.070 --> 06:43:48.080 align:start position:0%
in this bill on the day of the hearing
 
06:43:52.270 --> 06:43:52.280 align:start position:0%
um we actually didn't get the numbers um
 
06:43:57.590 --> 06:43:57.600 align:start position:0%
on the signin requested it from um
 
06:44:01.628 --> 06:44:01.638 align:start position:0%
Brad and um we had
 
06:44:04.510 --> 06:44:04.520 align:start position:0%
342 people signing in to oppose the bill
 
06:44:07.110 --> 06:44:07.120 align:start position:0%
and 22 in support um and that's in
 
06:44:10.708 --> 06:44:10.718 align:start position:0%
addition to the people who testified um
 
06:44:13.190 --> 06:44:13.200 align:start position:0%
and as rep representative Sykes stated
 
06:44:15.788 --> 06:44:15.798 align:start position:0%
only the sponsor testified um for this
 
06:44:18.830 --> 06:44:18.840 align:start position:0%
bill I also wanted to bring up the fact
 
06:44:22.350 --> 06:44:22.360 align:start position:0%
that we already have um a number of
 
06:44:24.190 --> 06:44:24.200 align:start position:0%
people who are not
 
06:44:26.110 --> 06:44:26.120 align:start position:0%
US citizens that hold New Hampshire
 
06:44:28.670 --> 06:44:28.680 align:start position:0%
driver's license they are legal
 
06:44:31.910 --> 06:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
residents um I requested some numbers
 
06:44:35.468 --> 06:44:35.478 align:start position:0%
from director blei that I received um
 
06:44:38.030 --> 06:44:38.040 align:start position:0%
right now in the state of New Hampshire
 
06:44:40.948 --> 06:44:40.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:44.030 --> 06:44:44.040 align:start position:0%
2,814 driver's licenses that have been
 
06:44:47.310 --> 06:44:47.320 align:start position:0%
issued to non-citizen permanent
 
06:44:50.670 --> 06:44:50.680 align:start position:0%
residents and
 
06:44:54.030 --> 06:44:54.040 align:start position:0%
2,867 non-driver IDs
 
06:44:55.590 --> 06:44:55.600 align:start position:0%
so that's a total of
 
06:44:59.590 --> 06:44:59.600 align:start position:0%
28,6 181 pieces of identification that
 
06:45:02.590 --> 06:45:02.600 align:start position:0%
we're talking about here um where these
 
06:45:05.468 --> 06:45:05.478 align:start position:0%
people who are here legally working
 
06:45:07.750 --> 06:45:07.760 align:start position:0%
raising their families contributing uh
 
06:45:11.310 --> 06:45:11.320 align:start position:0%
to our economy are now going to be um
 
06:45:14.230 --> 06:45:14.240 align:start position:0%
opening themselves up to discrimination
 
06:45:17.110 --> 06:45:17.120 align:start position:0%
every time they um need to hand their
 
06:45:20.150 --> 06:45:20.160 align:start position:0%
license over to anyone um which we could
 
06:45:22.230 --> 06:45:22.240 align:start position:0%
go into the whole list of different
 
06:45:24.110 --> 06:45:24.120 align:start position:0%
situations where one presents a driver's
 
06:45:25.788 --> 06:45:25.798 align:start position:0%
license but I think we've all heard them
 
06:45:30.030 --> 06:45:30.040 align:start position:0%
before um I think it's unfair to put
 
06:45:33.430 --> 06:45:33.440 align:start position:0%
these hardworking people um at risk like
 
06:45:36.590 --> 06:45:36.600 align:start position:0%
that and make them a second class uh
 
06:45:39.230 --> 06:45:39.240 align:start position:0%
resident of the State of New Hampshire
 
06:45:42.350 --> 06:45:42.360 align:start position:0%
um and I would hope that um the
 
06:45:46.430 --> 06:45:46.440 align:start position:0%
committee could not support the aut to
 
06:45:49.590 --> 06:45:49.600 align:start position:0%
pass motion um in a hopes that another
 
06:45:52.388 --> 06:45:52.398 align:start position:0%
motion may be made thank
 
06:45:52.398 --> 06:45:54.708 align:start position:0%
motion may be made thank
you

06:45:54.708 --> 06:45:54.718 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:45:58.030 --> 06:45:58.040 align:start position:0%
Cleaver yes thank you Mr chairman this
 
06:46:00.670 --> 06:46:00.680 align:start position:0%
bill is clearly
 
06:46:02.590 --> 06:46:02.600 align:start position:0%
discriminatory frankly I think it would
 
06:46:04.548 --> 06:46:04.558 align:start position:0%
be embarrassing for New Hampshire to
 
06:46:06.430 --> 06:46:06.440 align:start position:0%
adopt such a
 
06:46:09.948 --> 06:46:09.958 align:start position:0%
ruling and uh I I'm strongly opposed to
 
06:46:20.270 --> 06:46:20.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:23.468 --> 06:46:23.478 align:start position:0%
you go ahead representative sites yeah
 
06:46:25.150 --> 06:46:25.160 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry there was one point I thank
 
06:46:26.788 --> 06:46:26.798 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman one point I wanted to
 
06:46:30.948 --> 06:46:30.958 align:start position:0%
make too um it's not clear to me um what
 
06:46:34.310 --> 06:46:34.320 align:start position:0%
the benefit would be of doing this that
 
06:46:36.628 --> 06:46:36.638 align:start position:0%
isn't covered by other areas of the law
 
06:46:38.948 --> 06:46:38.958 align:start position:0%
and in addition to that um there's a
 
06:46:41.270 --> 06:46:41.280 align:start position:0%
fiscal note attached to this that says
 
06:46:43.830 --> 06:46:43.840 align:start position:0%
at a minimum it's going to cost
 
06:46:46.190 --> 06:46:46.200 align:start position:0%
$52,000 in order to make these changes
 
06:46:50.070 --> 06:46:50.080 align:start position:0%
and I just I it it escapes me about why
 
06:46:53.708 --> 06:46:53.718 align:start position:0%
we would want to spend the harder tax
 
06:46:56.750 --> 06:46:56.760 align:start position:0%
dollars in order to make a this type of
 
06:46:59.388 --> 06:46:59.398 align:start position:0%
change which has from what I can see
 
06:47:04.430 --> 06:47:04.440 align:start position:0%
little or no um good good per little or
 
06:47:08.548 --> 06:47:08.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:10.670 --> 06:47:10.680 align:start position:0%
identified thank
 
06:47:12.750 --> 06:47:12.760 align:start position:0%
you Z
 
06:47:14.948 --> 06:47:14.958 align:start position:0%
Smith uh thank you Mr chair I just
 
06:47:17.350 --> 06:47:17.360 align:start position:0%
wanted to address the real estate on the
 
06:47:20.030 --> 06:47:20.040 align:start position:0%
license issue there was a I guess a
 
06:47:21.830 --> 06:47:21.840 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding there the director was
 
06:47:23.190 --> 06:47:23.200 align:start position:0%
under the impression initially it would
 
06:47:25.430 --> 06:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
have be a text field that's a real
 
06:47:27.070 --> 06:47:27.080 align:start position:0%
problem language of the bill says
 
06:47:29.468 --> 06:47:29.478 align:start position:0%
approved security marking and putting a
 
06:47:33.468 --> 06:47:33.478 align:start position:0%
small image or logo or even text applied
 
06:47:35.708 --> 06:47:35.718 align:start position:0%
as an image there's no problem plenty of
 
06:47:38.510 --> 06:47:38.520 align:start position:0%
room and she can do
 
06:47:41.628 --> 06:47:41.638 align:start position:0%
it further
 
06:47:43.750 --> 06:47:43.760 align:start position:0%
discussion seeing
 
06:47:46.788 --> 06:47:46.798 align:start position:0%
none um I just have to say myself I
 
06:47:49.070 --> 06:47:49.080 align:start position:0%
don't i' heard this several times I
 
06:47:51.468 --> 06:47:51.478 align:start position:0%
paused I know this has been labeled as a
 
06:47:53.628 --> 06:47:53.638 align:start position:0%
discriminatory bill but I generally do
 
06:47:56.590 --> 06:47:56.600 align:start position:0%
not see it as that I mean if you read it
 
06:47:58.468 --> 06:47:58.478 align:start position:0%
uh indicating citizenship or legal
 
06:48:00.110 --> 06:48:00.120 align:start position:0%
residency and as you know there are
 
06:48:02.190 --> 06:48:02.200 align:start position:0%
plenty of legal residents that can also
 
06:48:04.430 --> 06:48:04.440 align:start position:0%
get not just regular driver's licenses
 
06:48:08.430 --> 06:48:08.440 align:start position:0%
but real IDs too um as we know that the
 
06:48:11.190 --> 06:48:11.200 align:start position:0%
driver's license began as a as a method
 
06:48:12.788 --> 06:48:12.798 align:start position:0%
of indicating whether you can drive a
 
06:48:14.910 --> 06:48:14.920 align:start position:0%
vehicle but we also all know that it's
 
06:48:17.510 --> 06:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
morphed into a lot more than that it
 
06:48:19.310 --> 06:48:19.320 align:start position:0%
essentially is our it's our
 
06:48:21.310 --> 06:48:21.320 align:start position:0%
identification with a lot of pertinent
 
06:48:23.708 --> 06:48:23.718 align:start position:0%
information on it this is just one more
 
06:48:26.030 --> 06:48:26.040 align:start position:0%
piece of information it's not going to
 
06:48:28.948 --> 06:48:28.958 align:start position:0%
be this scet letter or bold letters
 
06:48:30.670 --> 06:48:30.680 align:start position:0%
across the front of it it's going to be
 
06:48:32.430 --> 06:48:32.440 align:start position:0%
just a another bit of information on the
 
06:48:34.468 --> 06:48:34.478 align:start position:0%
back side of the license so I will be
 
06:48:38.150 --> 06:48:38.160 align:start position:0%
supporting this uh anybody
 
06:48:41.030 --> 06:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
else seeing
 
06:48:44.910 --> 06:48:44.920 align:start position:0%
n uh the motion on the floor is to pass
 
06:48:46.548 --> 06:48:46.558 align:start position:0%

06:57:17.510 --> 06:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
yes this the language in this bill and
 
06:57:20.310 --> 06:57:20.320 align:start position:0%
what it attempts to do goes above and
 
06:57:23.830 --> 06:57:23.840 align:start position:0%
beyond what the stated intent was from
 
06:57:25.310 --> 06:57:25.320 align:start position:0%
everybody who signed up to speak and
 
06:57:28.110 --> 06:57:28.120 align:start position:0%
everybody who submitted letters with
 
06:57:32.270 --> 06:57:32.280 align:start position:0%
with there's a lot of testimony about
 
06:57:36.708 --> 06:57:36.718 align:start position:0%
um uh undocumented people living in fear
 
06:57:39.270 --> 06:57:39.280 align:start position:0%
but none of the testimony talk about
 
06:57:42.350 --> 06:57:42.360 align:start position:0%
what was that issue was enforcing our
 
06:57:45.830 --> 06:57:45.840 align:start position:0%
existing laws or um working with our
 
06:57:50.388 --> 06:57:50.398 align:start position:0%
partners to enforce existing laws and I
 
06:57:52.788 --> 06:57:52.798 align:start position:0%
just I am I really think think we need
 
06:57:56.030 --> 06:57:56.040 align:start position:0%
to um take a step back here and think
 
06:57:59.910 --> 06:57:59.920 align:start position:0%
about what the best ways to help our
 
06:58:02.150 --> 06:58:02.160 align:start position:0%
undocumented Community is and I can tell
 
06:58:05.070 --> 06:58:05.080 align:start position:0%
you that this bill is not so with that I
 
06:58:06.830 --> 06:58:06.840 align:start position:0%
do move and I hope the rest of the
 
06:58:09.270 --> 06:58:09.280 align:start position:0%
committee votes
 
06:58:09.280 --> 06:58:12.788 align:start position:0%
committee votes
I

06:58:12.788 --> 06:58:12.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:17.510 --> 06:58:17.520 align:start position:0%
discussion SES thank you Mr chairman
 
06:58:22.430 --> 06:58:22.440 align:start position:0%
so the um the purpose of this bill at
 
06:58:24.708 --> 06:58:24.718 align:start position:0%
the end of the day is to improve Public
 
06:58:28.510 --> 06:58:28.520 align:start position:0%
Safety that is what this is all about it
 
06:58:31.590 --> 06:58:31.600 align:start position:0%
is clear from testimony that we have
 
06:58:34.388 --> 06:58:34.398 align:start position:0%
unfortunately undocumented persons
 
06:58:37.070 --> 06:58:37.080 align:start position:0%
driving motor vehicles because it's the
 
06:58:40.830 --> 06:58:40.840 align:start position:0%
only solution or choice that they have
 
06:58:44.350 --> 06:58:44.360 align:start position:0%
and that is unfortunate because we have
 
06:58:46.990 --> 06:58:47.000 align:start position:0%
no way of knowing if in fact they should
 
06:58:50.190 --> 06:58:50.200 align:start position:0%
be driving whether they are
 
06:58:53.030 --> 06:58:53.040 align:start position:0%
capable uh whether they are whether and
 
06:58:54.430 --> 06:58:54.440 align:start position:0%
for whatever the reason why they might
 
06:58:56.190 --> 06:58:56.200 align:start position:0%
not be capable we have no way of
 
06:58:59.628 --> 06:58:59.638 align:start position:0%
determining that this bill attempts to
 
06:59:01.510 --> 06:59:01.520 align:start position:0%
provide a
 
06:59:05.230 --> 06:59:05.240 align:start position:0%
methodology which would allow the state
 
06:59:09.388 --> 06:59:09.398 align:start position:0%
to determine if this person should be
 
06:59:12.350 --> 06:59:12.360 align:start position:0%
driving or should not be driving and
 
06:59:16.948 --> 06:59:16.958 align:start position:0%
that's through a fair system of testing
 
06:59:20.868 --> 06:59:20.878 align:start position:0%
for uh written and reading comprehension
 
06:59:24.868 --> 06:59:24.878 align:start position:0%
and also for a test for actual driving
 
06:59:24.878 --> 06:59:27.990 align:start position:0%
and also for a test for actual driving
ability

06:59:27.990 --> 06:59:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:31.670 --> 06:59:31.680 align:start position:0%
um this year we heard from a variety of
 
06:59:33.628 --> 06:59:33.638 align:start position:0%
organizations that have been in support
 
06:59:36.948 --> 06:59:36.958 align:start position:0%
of this bill those organizations ran the
 
06:59:39.868 --> 06:59:39.878 align:start position:0%
gamut from the American friend service
 
06:59:46.190 --> 06:59:46.200 align:start position:0%
committee to the ACLU to um various
 
06:59:46.200 --> 06:59:47.430 align:start position:0%
committee to the ACLU to um various
immigrants

06:59:47.430 --> 06:59:47.440 align:start position:0%
immigrants
 
06:59:49.590 --> 06:59:49.600 align:start position:0%
groups and
 
06:59:52.270 --> 06:59:52.280 align:start position:0%
importantly recognizing the public saf
 
06:59:55.868 --> 06:59:55.878 align:start position:0%
the aspect of this we also heard from
 
06:59:58.628 --> 06:59:58.638 align:start position:0%
police Chiefs who say that this would be
 
07:00:02.030 --> 07:00:02.040 align:start position:0%
a really important tool for them to uh
 
07:00:05.750 --> 07:00:05.760 align:start position:0%
keep the motoring public safe and keep
 
07:00:08.310 --> 07:00:08.320 align:start position:0%
people safe from a variety of different
 
07:00:13.468 --> 07:00:13.478 align:start position:0%
reasons um we did in fact hear that um
 
07:00:17.430 --> 07:00:17.440 align:start position:0%
more nearly 300 people signed in in
 
07:00:20.948 --> 07:00:20.958 align:start position:0%
favor of this bill as opposed to iing it
 
07:00:22.628 --> 07:00:22.638 align:start position:0%
only seven were opposed and they were
 
07:00:22.638 --> 07:00:25.190 align:start position:0%
only seven were opposed and they were
too

07:00:25.190 --> 07:00:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:28.948 --> 07:00:28.958 align:start position:0%
neutral for a transportation bill that
 
07:00:32.070 --> 07:00:32.080 align:start position:0%
is that's the good news bad news about
 
07:00:34.990 --> 07:00:35.000 align:start position:0%
uh online you know Blended me hearings
 
07:00:37.310 --> 07:00:37.320 align:start position:0%
that we're having we actually got for
 
07:00:40.110 --> 07:00:40.120 align:start position:0%
the first time a real opportunity to
 
07:00:45.510 --> 07:00:45.520 align:start position:0%
hear and from people who are in support
 
07:00:47.070 --> 07:00:47.080 align:start position:0%
of this billing when it shows the
 
07:00:50.910 --> 07:00:50.920 align:start position:0%
widespread support and it R runs from a
 
07:00:55.150 --> 07:00:55.160 align:start position:0%
bunch of different um people um the
 
07:00:57.548 --> 07:00:57.558 align:start position:0%
other piece that didn't get an awful lot
 
07:00:59.628 --> 07:00:59.638 align:start position:0%
of discussion but but only a minor part
 
07:01:02.110 --> 07:01:02.120 align:start position:0%
but I think which is equally important
 
07:01:04.310 --> 07:01:04.320 align:start position:0%
is that there's an economic aspect to
 
07:01:07.830 --> 07:01:07.840 align:start position:0%
this in that insurance companies will
 
07:01:10.830 --> 07:01:10.840 align:start position:0%
have the possibility of selling more
 
07:01:13.270 --> 07:01:13.280 align:start position:0%
insurance that people will be better
 
07:01:16.670 --> 07:01:16.680 align:start position:0%
able to keep their jobs and be safe that
 
07:01:20.628 --> 07:01:20.638 align:start position:0%
way um and that is one of the these two
 
07:01:24.990 --> 07:01:25.000 align:start position:0%
things Public Safety and um finding ways
 
07:01:28.510 --> 07:01:28.520 align:start position:0%
to make um a better economy for everyone
 
07:01:30.468 --> 07:01:30.478 align:start position:0%
in the state these are really Prime
 
07:01:33.990 --> 07:01:34.000 align:start position:0%
directives for this committee um I know
 
07:01:36.070 --> 07:01:36.080 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of emotion about why or
 
07:01:39.190 --> 07:01:39.200 align:start position:0%
what this may or may not do um this bill
 
07:01:42.150 --> 07:01:42.160 align:start position:0%
did have bipartisan support when it was
 
07:01:46.070 --> 07:01:46.080 align:start position:0%
introduced this year I would urge my
 
07:01:48.990 --> 07:01:49.000 align:start position:0%
colleagues on the um transportation
 
07:01:52.548 --> 07:01:52.558 align:start position:0%
committee to take a careful look at
 
07:01:55.110 --> 07:01:55.120 align:start position:0%
what this bill actually
 
07:01:58.788 --> 07:01:58.798 align:start position:0%
does in terms of improving Public Safety
 
07:02:02.750 --> 07:02:02.760 align:start position:0%
and I would appreciate that we uh do not
 
07:02:04.788 --> 07:02:04.798 align:start position:0%
itl this bill so that another motion
 
07:02:08.150 --> 07:02:08.160 align:start position:0%
could be introduced thank
 
07:02:10.590 --> 07:02:10.600 align:start position:0%
you pres
 
07:02:14.190 --> 07:02:14.200 align:start position:0%
pever thank you Mr chairman currently we
 
07:02:16.350 --> 07:02:16.360 align:start position:0%
have thousands of people on the road who
 
07:02:18.310 --> 07:02:18.320 align:start position:0%
are without
 
07:02:20.670 --> 07:02:20.680 align:start position:0%
licenses which I find terribly
 
07:02:23.468 --> 07:02:23.478 align:start position:0%
frightening in need to be tested they
 
07:02:26.788 --> 07:02:26.798 align:start position:0%
need to be examined and need to be
 
07:02:29.548 --> 07:02:29.558 align:start position:0%
licensed for all the reasons we've
 
07:02:32.548 --> 07:02:32.558 align:start position:0%
discussed it is a public safety issue it
 
07:02:35.708 --> 07:02:35.718 align:start position:0%
is a humanitarian issue there is no
 
07:02:38.110 --> 07:02:38.120 align:start position:0%
other Transportation available to many
 
07:02:41.388 --> 07:02:41.398 align:start position:0%
people undocumented is not
 
07:02:44.110 --> 07:02:44.120 align:start position:0%
illegal and I think we need to have an
 
07:02:46.350 --> 07:02:46.360 align:start position:0%
opportunity for them to be licensed for
 
07:02:50.708 --> 07:02:50.718 align:start position:0%
our for our safety and and uh for the
 
07:02:52.510 --> 07:02:52.520 align:start position:0%
benefit of all
 
07:02:52.520 --> 07:02:55.190 align:start position:0%
benefit of all
thank

07:02:55.190 --> 07:02:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:02:57.628 --> 07:02:57.638 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
07:03:01.910 --> 07:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
Stevens yes thank you Mr chair um
 
07:03:04.230 --> 07:03:04.240 align:start position:0%
representative Cleaver touched on it a
 
07:03:08.230 --> 07:03:08.240 align:start position:0%
little bit but what concerns me um be
 
07:03:12.070 --> 07:03:12.080 align:start position:0%
besides the obvious Merit of the safety
 
07:03:15.030 --> 07:03:15.040 align:start position:0%
and financial implications is the are
 
07:03:18.708 --> 07:03:18.718 align:start position:0%
the social implications the ability of
 
07:03:23.350 --> 07:03:23.360 align:start position:0%
people to be able to shop for food get
 
07:03:27.350 --> 07:03:27.360 align:start position:0%
their children to Medical Care and
 
07:03:31.468 --> 07:03:31.478 align:start position:0%
school Affairs and so forth so I am
 
07:03:36.070 --> 07:03:36.080 align:start position:0%
going to um be in favor of um making a
 
07:03:39.430 --> 07:03:39.440 align:start position:0%
motion for another opportunity to look
 
07:03:41.868 --> 07:03:41.878 align:start position:0%
at this Bill thank
 
07:03:46.830 --> 07:03:46.840 align:start position:0%
you representative Eric thank you Mr
 
07:03:50.628 --> 07:03:50.638 align:start position:0%
chair I vote in favor of uh iing this
 
07:03:52.990 --> 07:03:53.000 align:start position:0%
bill simply because the director of the
 
07:03:57.990 --> 07:03:58.000 align:start position:0%
DMV um cited some opposition to it and
 
07:04:01.510 --> 07:04:01.520 align:start position:0%
uh I think uh maybe at another time you
 
07:04:03.830 --> 07:04:03.840 align:start position:0%
know we can consider something different
 
07:04:06.350 --> 07:04:06.360 align:start position:0%
but uh as it is written it is it's just
 
07:04:06.360 --> 07:04:16.948 align:start position:0%
but uh as it is written it is it's just
not

07:04:16.948 --> 07:04:16.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:04:18.990 --> 07:04:19.000 align:start position:0%
ready thank you Mr
 
07:04:22.510 --> 07:04:22.520 align:start position:0%
chairman um we received written
 
07:04:25.270 --> 07:04:25.280 align:start position:0%
testimony via email I can't remember who
 
07:04:27.990 --> 07:04:28.000 align:start position:0%
it was from but I'm sure that we would
 
07:04:30.548 --> 07:04:30.558 align:start position:0%
be able to find it if we all went
 
07:04:32.430 --> 07:04:32.440 align:start position:0%
through all that stuff that the issue
 
07:04:36.310 --> 07:04:36.320 align:start position:0%
here is we have anywhere from the number
 
07:04:39.468 --> 07:04:39.478 align:start position:0%
was 15,000 people let's say they're not
 
07:04:43.430 --> 07:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
going away they're not leaving our state
 
07:04:48.510 --> 07:04:48.520 align:start position:0%
they're here many of them had came here
 
07:04:51.070 --> 07:04:51.080 align:start position:0%
um under certain visas that have lapsed
 
07:04:53.708 --> 07:04:53.718 align:start position:0%
or um different situations where they
 
07:04:56.150 --> 07:04:56.160 align:start position:0%
got caught in some kind of legal hole
 
07:04:59.388 --> 07:04:59.398 align:start position:0%
that their legal status um was not
 
07:05:01.948 --> 07:05:01.958 align:start position:0%
clarified and things are they're trying
 
07:05:04.350 --> 07:05:04.360 align:start position:0%
to figure things out but the reality is
 
07:05:07.750 --> 07:05:07.760 align:start position:0%
this is a humanitarian issue and this
 
07:05:12.548 --> 07:05:12.558 align:start position:0%
is people who likely have children who
 
07:05:16.868 --> 07:05:16.878 align:start position:0%
are US citizens um these people are
 
07:05:19.548 --> 07:05:19.558 align:start position:0%
trying to feed their families they're
 
07:05:23.270 --> 07:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
trying to work and contribute to society
 
07:05:24.990 --> 07:05:25.000 align:start position:0%
and for us
 
07:05:29.270 --> 07:05:29.280 align:start position:0%
to um not allow this one privilege which
 
07:05:33.910 --> 07:05:33.920 align:start position:0%
17 other states give to undocumented
 
07:05:36.270 --> 07:05:36.280 align:start position:0%
people to be able to be contributing
 
07:05:37.468 --> 07:05:37.478 align:start position:0%
members of
 
07:05:40.788 --> 07:05:40.798 align:start position:0%
society um I I I just think it's wrong
 
07:05:43.670 --> 07:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
and I think that um we need to be able
 
07:05:46.110 --> 07:05:46.120 align:start position:0%
to figure out a way for this group of
 
07:05:48.948 --> 07:05:48.958 align:start position:0%
people um
 
07:05:52.110 --> 07:05:52.120 align:start position:0%
to be able to contribute the way they
 
07:05:53.910 --> 07:05:53.920 align:start position:0%
already are but to do so in a way that
 
07:05:55.750 --> 07:05:55.760 align:start position:0%
does not put such an unfortunate
 
07:05:59.110 --> 07:05:59.120 align:start position:0%
hardship on them in addition I thought
 
07:06:03.270 --> 07:06:03.280 align:start position:0%
the testimony from um Chief carrian and
 
07:06:07.230 --> 07:06:07.240 align:start position:0%
chief hodi about the role of law
 
07:06:09.788 --> 07:06:09.798 align:start position:0%
enforcement and how they interact with
 
07:06:12.670 --> 07:06:12.680 align:start position:0%
these Community um and the fact that
 
07:06:15.830 --> 07:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
since they don't have a valid license
 
07:06:18.510 --> 07:06:18.520 align:start position:0%
that affects way more than just if they
 
07:06:20.388 --> 07:06:20.398 align:start position:0%
get in the car and drive or not this
 
07:06:22.948 --> 07:06:22.958 align:start position:0%
affects every inter action they have
 
07:06:24.510 --> 07:06:24.520 align:start position:0%
with the law enforcement Community
 
07:06:26.910 --> 07:06:26.920 align:start position:0%
whether they're the victim of a crime
 
07:06:29.548 --> 07:06:29.558 align:start position:0%
whether they have a concern whether they
 
07:06:33.230 --> 07:06:33.240 align:start position:0%
they need some kind of assistance and um
 
07:06:36.670 --> 07:06:36.680 align:start position:0%
I I just think that not moving forward
 
07:06:40.030 --> 07:06:40.040 align:start position:0%
with um a solution for this community is
 
07:06:42.590 --> 07:06:42.600 align:start position:0%
is just unfortunate and um I would hope
 
07:06:44.990 --> 07:06:45.000 align:start position:0%
that we can overturn the motion on the
 
07:06:48.070 --> 07:06:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:51.310 --> 07:06:51.320 align:start position:0%
you representative Cleveland yes sorry
 
07:06:53.430 --> 07:06:53.440 align:start position:0%
for the repeat I just wanted to point
 
07:06:56.110 --> 07:06:56.120 align:start position:0%
out what representative tersi already
 
07:06:59.548 --> 07:06:59.558 align:start position:0%
said the impressive testimony from the
 
07:07:03.510 --> 07:07:03.520 align:start position:0%
chiefs of police it would be very very
 
07:07:05.990 --> 07:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
beneficial for our law enforcement
 
07:07:09.030 --> 07:07:09.040 align:start position:0%
Community to have IDs on people and
 
07:07:11.750 --> 07:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
driver's license not only on the roads
 
07:07:14.548 --> 07:07:14.558 align:start position:0%
but other other purposes as they
 
07:07:17.230 --> 07:07:17.240 align:start position:0%
testified very very important and
 
07:07:19.750 --> 07:07:19.760 align:start position:0%
benefit beneficial for the uh law
 
07:07:23.310 --> 07:07:23.320 align:start position:0%
enforcement group thanks
 
07:07:26.310 --> 07:07:26.320 align:start position:0%
senori thank you Mr chairman you
 
07:07:29.070 --> 07:07:29.080 align:start position:0%
know the issue I have with this bill
 
07:07:32.190 --> 07:07:32.200 align:start position:0%
just right from the GetGo is for me
 
07:07:34.430 --> 07:07:34.440 align:start position:0%
Crossing that first portal I mean we're
 
07:07:37.310 --> 07:07:37.320 align:start position:0%
hearing illegals or a document whatever
 
07:07:42.310 --> 07:07:42.320 align:start position:0%
you want to call um those people 14,000
 
07:07:44.788 --> 07:07:44.798 align:start position:0%
in our testimony we're hearing that you
 
07:07:47.070 --> 07:07:47.080 align:start position:0%
know they they're entitled to licenses
 
07:07:49.070 --> 07:07:49.080 align:start position:0%
because they may be in between Visa they
 
07:07:51.468 --> 07:07:51.478 align:start position:0%
have Visa issues well if I look at
 
07:07:53.948 --> 07:07:53.958 align:start position:0%
14,000 I don't think all
 
07:07:57.388 --> 07:07:57.398 align:start position:0%
14,000 have Visa issues which is causing
 
07:07:59.868 --> 07:07:59.878 align:start position:0%
them to lose their license you know for
 
07:08:02.670 --> 07:08:02.680 align:start position:0%
me when I when I read this legislation
 
07:08:04.230 --> 07:08:04.240 align:start position:0%
the real hurdle is getting over that
 
07:08:07.030 --> 07:08:07.040 align:start position:0%
first one where everyone's talking of
 
07:08:10.388 --> 07:08:10.398 align:start position:0%
privilege in a right we talking about
 
07:08:13.708 --> 07:08:13.718 align:start position:0%
people who are illegal or undocumented
 
07:08:15.788 --> 07:08:15.798 align:start position:0%
and I don't feel that they have that
 
07:08:17.750 --> 07:08:17.760 align:start position:0%
right or privilege and that I have to
 
07:08:20.430 --> 07:08:20.440 align:start position:0%
vote itl on this legislation thank you
 
07:08:24.548 --> 07:08:24.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:08:24.558 --> 07:08:26.270 align:start position:0%
 
representative

07:08:26.270 --> 07:08:26.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
07:08:30.468 --> 07:08:30.478 align:start position:0%
sites thank you Mr chairman
 
07:08:34.110 --> 07:08:34.120 align:start position:0%
um I just I guess I would make the point
 
07:08:38.670 --> 07:08:38.680 align:start position:0%
that we are in agreement with uh some of
 
07:08:40.468 --> 07:08:40.478 align:start position:0%
the other Representatives here on the
 
07:08:42.868 --> 07:08:42.878 align:start position:0%
transportation committee that driving is
 
07:08:47.430 --> 07:08:47.440 align:start position:0%
a privilege we acknowledge that and and
 
07:08:50.990 --> 07:08:51.000 align:start position:0%
accordingly as a privilege one should be
 
07:08:51.000 --> 07:08:52.030 align:start position:0%
accordingly as a privilege one should be
tested

07:08:52.030 --> 07:08:52.040 align:start position:0%
tested
 
07:08:55.030 --> 07:08:55.040 align:start position:0%
and determined that they
 
07:08:58.270 --> 07:08:58.280 align:start position:0%
are should be recipients of that
 
07:09:02.030 --> 07:09:02.040 align:start position:0%
privilege um and that that is a key
 
07:09:05.350 --> 07:09:05.360 align:start position:0%
point and I I I hope that folks will
 
07:09:08.310 --> 07:09:08.320 align:start position:0%
remember that we are trying to make the
 
07:09:12.310 --> 07:09:12.320 align:start position:0%
the privilege of driving and the ability
 
07:09:14.868 --> 07:09:14.878 align:start position:0%
to test that they're driving safely is
 
07:09:17.590 --> 07:09:17.600 align:start position:0%
Paramount to the the greater public
 
07:09:22.670 --> 07:09:22.680 align:start position:0%
interest thank you J Smith
 
07:09:26.628 --> 07:09:26.638 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman sorry three points
 
07:09:29.310 --> 07:09:29.320 align:start position:0%
um so one I apologize for missing
 
07:09:31.430 --> 07:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
hearing on this one but the compelling
 
07:09:33.788 --> 07:09:33.798 align:start position:0%
testimony I heard from the time we heard
 
07:09:37.948 --> 07:09:37.958 align:start position:0%
this bill last was how careful folks are
 
07:09:39.310 --> 07:09:39.320 align:start position:0%
because the worried about getting
 
07:09:41.510 --> 07:09:41.520 align:start position:0%
stopped we had one gentleman testify
 
07:09:43.110 --> 07:09:43.120 align:start position:0%
that he went as far as to install
 
07:09:46.468 --> 07:09:46.478 align:start position:0%
mirrors in his garage so that when he's
 
07:09:47.990 --> 07:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
going to leave he can just look in the
 
07:09:49.310 --> 07:09:49.320 align:start position:0%
mirror and make sure that all the lights
 
07:09:51.388 --> 07:09:51.398 align:start position:0%
on his car are working I want to ask how
 
07:09:54.190 --> 07:09:54.200 align:start position:0%
many of you did that today cuz I didn't
 
07:09:55.628 --> 07:09:55.638 align:start position:0%
um they they make sure that they don't
 
07:09:57.388 --> 07:09:57.398 align:start position:0%
have anything dangling off the car they
 
07:10:00.190 --> 07:10:00.200 align:start position:0%
do a whole walk around and I didn't do
 
07:10:04.230 --> 07:10:04.240 align:start position:0%
that today did you I I'm guessing not so
 
07:10:06.628 --> 07:10:06.638 align:start position:0%
I would balance the public safety issue
 
07:10:08.468 --> 07:10:08.478 align:start position:0%
with the fact that we heard lots of
 
07:10:10.468 --> 07:10:10.478 align:start position:0%
testimony that they're being more
 
07:10:12.868 --> 07:10:12.878 align:start position:0%
careful than every single person on this
 
07:10:14.990 --> 07:10:15.000 align:start position:0%
committee i' would be willing to wager
 
07:10:17.868 --> 07:10:17.878 align:start position:0%
anyway um another thing that is missing
 
07:10:19.310 --> 07:10:19.320 align:start position:0%
from the bill is I don't see any
 
07:10:21.310 --> 07:10:21.320 align:start position:0%
references to the financial
 
07:10:23.788 --> 07:10:23.798 align:start position:0%
responsibility was for having licenses
 
07:10:25.708 --> 07:10:25.718 align:start position:0%
I've asked a few people if you don't
 
07:10:27.510 --> 07:10:27.520 align:start position:0%
have a Social Security number can you
 
07:10:29.750 --> 07:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
get SR22 insurance because there are
 
07:10:31.830 --> 07:10:31.840 align:start position:0%
things you can do when you're driving
 
07:10:33.948 --> 07:10:33.958 align:start position:0%
that could end up with you having to get
 
07:10:36.030 --> 07:10:36.040 align:start position:0%
that that's an unanswered question in
 
07:10:39.230 --> 07:10:39.240 align:start position:0%
the bill so that's another flaw and the
 
07:10:42.548 --> 07:10:42.558 align:start position:0%
last one it's a driver's license not
 
07:10:45.468 --> 07:10:45.478 align:start position:0%
identification right wrong like it or
 
07:10:48.510 --> 07:10:48.520 align:start position:0%
not it's identification it's what people
 
07:10:51.270 --> 07:10:51.280 align:start position:0%
accept and what we should have had was
 
07:10:53.590 --> 07:10:53.600 align:start position:0%
was a way to have a separate license
 
07:10:56.430 --> 07:10:56.440 align:start position:0%
that doesn't look like the one for
 
07:10:58.388 --> 07:10:58.398 align:start position:0%
everybody else we could just get past
 
07:11:00.750 --> 07:11:00.760 align:start position:0%
that whole issue but we heard testimony
 
07:11:04.350 --> 07:11:04.360 align:start position:0%
last time also it must be the very same
 
07:11:07.910 --> 07:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
license that you have in your wallet so
 
07:11:11.350 --> 07:11:11.360 align:start position:0%
for these three reasons um I I can't
 
07:11:12.788 --> 07:11:12.798 align:start position:0%
support the bill there are problems that
 
07:11:16.230 --> 07:11:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:11:20.150 --> 07:11:20.160 align:start position:0%
out any further
 
07:11:22.430 --> 07:11:22.440 align:start position:0%
discussion seeing
 
07:11:24.670 --> 07:11:24.680 align:start position:0%

07:11:28.788 --> 07:11:28.798 align:start position:0%

yet Mr chairman y I was told that um and
 
07:14:21.190 --> 07:14:21.200 align:start position:0%
and I have not done this myself but I've
 
07:14:23.830 --> 07:14:23.840 align:start position:0%
been told because we had announced that
 
07:14:27.788 --> 07:14:27.798 align:start position:0%
all um all roll calls would be all votes
 
07:14:31.190 --> 07:14:31.200 align:start position:0%
would be roll call by by adjourning we
 
07:14:37.070 --> 07:14:37.080 align:start position:0%
have to roll call out of here um as an
 
07:14:40.670 --> 07:14:40.680 align:start position:0%
as taking the that's what I've been told
 
07:14:43.750 --> 07:14:43.760 align:start position:0%
really yeah the first time I've heard it
 
07:14:47.230 --> 07:14:47.240 align:start position:0%
in nine years I well they said because
 
07:14:49.948 --> 07:14:49.958 align:start position:0%
of the emergency order is where it came
 
07:14:49.958 --> 07:14:51.430 align:start position:0%
of the emergency order is where it came
from

07:14:51.430 --> 07:14:51.440 align:start position:0%
from
 
07:14:52.708 --> 07:14:52.718 align:start position:0%
I didn't hear what he said motion he's
 
07:14:54.948 --> 07:14:54.958 align:start position:0%
saying a motion he heard just recently
 
07:14:57.190 --> 07:14:57.200 align:start position:0%
because of the emergency order that even
 
07:14:58.708 --> 07:14:58.718 align:start position:0%
a motion to adjourn would require a
 
07:14:58.718 --> 07:14:59.830 align:start position:0%
a motion to adjourn would require a
rooll

07:14:59.830 --> 07:14:59.840 align:start position:0%
rooll
 
07:15:01.830 --> 07:15:01.840 align:start position:0%
call what
 
07:15:01.840 --> 07:15:03.590 align:start position:0%
call what
to

07:15:03.590 --> 07:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
to
 
07:15:08.310 --> 07:15:08.320 align:start position:0%
no meeting in committee to adjourn you
 
07:15:10.670 --> 07:15:10.680 align:start position:0%
declare that it's adjourned right
 
07:15:12.388 --> 07:15:12.398 align:start position:0%
because because because we're doing our
 
07:15:14.990 --> 07:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
work as either public hearing or an
 
07:15:17.350 --> 07:15:17.360 align:start position:0%
executive session which that's already
 
07:15:22.230 --> 07:15:22.240 align:start position:0%
been closed so so so this is saying the
 
07:15:24.270 --> 07:15:24.280 align:start position:0%
the emergency order says all votes will
 
07:15:26.868 --> 07:15:26.878 align:start position:0%
be so they were saying that this was a
 
07:15:30.670 --> 07:15:30.680 align:start position:0%
vote to adjourn no there was yeah all
 
07:15:32.590 --> 07:15:32.600 align:start position:0%
votes must be roll calls in a house of
 
07:15:34.948 --> 07:15:34.958 align:start position:0%
committees there is no vote to
 
07:15:38.310 --> 07:15:38.320 align:start position:0%
adjourn so okay he just says we're Jour
