00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:41.600 align:start position:0%
information we have I know that that
 
00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:44.440 align:start position:0%
some people who uh either support or
 
00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:47.480 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill and um but do not wish
 
00:12:51.669 --> 00:12:51.679 align:start position:0%
to testify have signed the blue sheets I
 
00:12:54.510 --> 00:12:54.520 align:start position:0%
think it's it's important that you un
 
00:12:56.430 --> 00:12:56.440 align:start position:0%
that you understand that the blue sheets
 
00:12:58.669 --> 00:12:58.679 align:start position:0%
that are up there are are that are out
 
00:13:01.189 --> 00:13:01.199 align:start position:0%
there are not just for this bill there
 
00:13:03.149 --> 00:13:03.159 align:start position:0%
are blue sheets out there for all the
 
00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:05.120 align:start position:0%
bills we're going to be hearing today
 
00:13:06.510 --> 00:13:06.520 align:start position:0%
which includes some that we're going to
 
00:13:07.709 --> 00:13:07.719 align:start position:0%
be hearing this afternoon that have
 
00:13:10.070 --> 00:13:10.080 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with this so my only point
 
00:13:12.629 --> 00:13:12.639 align:start position:0%
is if you thought that all the blue
 
00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:14.760 align:start position:0%
sheets were for this bill and you signed
 
00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:17.880 align:start position:0%
up to support or or object you if you
 
00:13:19.510 --> 00:13:19.520 align:start position:0%
didn't look carefully you may have
 
00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:23.080 align:start position:0%
signed the wrong blue sheet so uh please
 
00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:26.440 align:start position:0%
be sure that if you if you wanted to you
 
00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
know voice your view on hp1 1283 that's
 
00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:32.800 align:start position:0%
this bill that that's the form you
 
00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:35.560 align:start position:0%

00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:47.840 align:start position:0%

all so um ladies and gentlemen before we
 
00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
get started I just want to kind of uh
 
00:15:15.669 --> 00:15:15.679 align:start position:0%
set just a couple of ground rules um we
 
00:15:17.629 --> 00:15:17.639 align:start position:0%
want to give everybody we know that
 
00:15:19.709 --> 00:15:19.719 align:start position:0%
there are people have strong views on on
 
00:15:21.510 --> 00:15:21.520 align:start position:0%
this issue on whatever side you may be
 
00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:23.480 align:start position:0%
on and we want to have every every body
 
00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:26.800 align:start position:0%
have an opportunity to be heard I have
 
00:15:29.830 --> 00:15:29.840 align:start position:0%
about 90 people who've signed up to
 
00:15:32.709 --> 00:15:32.719 align:start position:0%
testify um in light of that I'm going to
 
00:15:35.070 --> 00:15:35.080 align:start position:0%
impose except for the the first witness
 
00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:37.120 align:start position:0%
who is the Prime sponsor in in in
 
00:15:39.189 --> 00:15:39.199 align:start position:0%
accordance with our Traditions I'm going
 
00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:40.920 align:start position:0%
to impose on other Witnesses a
 
00:15:43.669 --> 00:15:43.679 align:start position:0%
limitation of two minutes uh for your
 
00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:45.080 align:start position:0%
testimony and we're going to have to
 
00:15:47.669 --> 00:15:47.679 align:start position:0%
enforce that fairly strictly the other
 
00:15:50.149 --> 00:15:50.159 align:start position:0%
thing I would say please is this um I
 
00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:52.080 align:start position:0%
know I I understand that people may be
 
00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
nervous if you're testing toine that's
 
00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
completely understandable um please
 
00:15:59.070 --> 00:15:59.080 align:start position:0%
understand though if you have written
 
00:16:01.709 --> 00:16:01.719 align:start position:0%
testimony we want to receive that and we
 
00:16:03.510 --> 00:16:03.520 align:start position:0%
will receive just you all you have to do
 
00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:05.480 align:start position:0%
is hand it in us and we will you know
 
00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:07.120 align:start position:0%
we'll be happy to receive it we will
 
00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:10.880 align:start position:0%
read it um and uh and and your you know
 
00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
what you've had to say will be
 
00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
considered by us it really is not
 
00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:17.480 align:start position:0%
helpful I think to us if you have
 
00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:20.040 align:start position:0%
written testimony if you just come up
 
00:16:21.750 --> 00:16:21.760 align:start position:0%
and spend your two minutes reading it
 
00:16:23.709 --> 00:16:23.719 align:start position:0%
that is not particularly helpful to us
 
00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:25.760 align:start position:0%
it would be much better to have you sort
 
00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:27.960 align:start position:0%
of speak extemporaneously tell us you
 
00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
know what you want to tell us so to
 
00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:31.760 align:start position:0%
speak I think we would all find that
 
00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:34.600 align:start position:0%
much much uh more helpful um so I hope
 
00:16:37.629 --> 00:16:37.639 align:start position:0%
that you'll please do that um uh and
 
00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
with that I'm going to recognize the uh
 
00:16:47.629 --> 00:16:47.639 align:start position:0%

copenhaver along with others sponsored a
 
00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
bill on this very subject and it came to
 
00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:20.960 align:start position:0%
the Judiciary Committee that was more
 
00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:24.360 align:start position:0%
than 25 years ago but the shock I
 
00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:27.480 align:start position:0%
experienced in that hearing has stayed
 
00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:32.280 align:start position:0%
with me caring competent committed
 
00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:34.840 align:start position:0%

00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:37.480 align:start position:0%
powerless to help their patients who
 
00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:40.120 align:start position:0%
were nearing the end of their lives and
 
00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:42.880 align:start position:0%
experiencing unbearable
 
00:18:45.310 --> 00:18:45.320 align:start position:0%
pain they were concerned that if they
 
00:18:48.669 --> 00:18:48.679 align:start position:0%
used drugs to minimize the pain they
 
00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
could be charged with a crime that same
 
00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:54.480 align:start position:0%
concern was expressed by dedicated
 
00:18:56.350 --> 00:18:56.360 align:start position:0%
concerned members of the burgeoning

nearing the end of their lives and their

families since then at regular intervals
 
00:19:08.550 --> 00:19:08.560 align:start position:0%
bills addressing this issue of end of
 
00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:11.080 align:start position:0%
life appeared some to form study
 
00:19:14.550 --> 00:19:14.560 align:start position:0%
committees some to take specific action
 
00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
some passed one house or another some
 
00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:20.760 align:start position:0%
pass both only to die on the governor's
 
00:19:23.669 --> 00:19:23.679 align:start position:0%
desk the opposition tended to come
 
00:19:27.669 --> 00:19:27.679 align:start position:0%
primarily from three groups some members
 
00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:30.120 align:start position:0%
of the disability Community afraid that
 
00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
there would be pressure for them to end
 
00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:34.310 align:start position:0%
there would be pressure for them to end
their

00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:37.120 align:start position:0%
lives some representatives of the
 
00:19:40.149 --> 00:19:40.159 align:start position:0%
hospital Community for reasons that I
 
00:19:43.470 --> 00:19:43.480 align:start position:0%
can't explain and the leaders but not
 
00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:45.440 align:start position:0%
necessarily a majority of the
 
00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
parishioners of one particular religious
 
00:19:52.990 --> 00:19:53.000 align:start position:0%
denomination believing as I do in the
 
00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:55.440 align:start position:0%
constitutionally established separation
 
00:19:58.669 --> 00:19:58.679 align:start position:0%
of church and state I respect and
 
00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:01.440 align:start position:0%
protect the rights of the individuals to
 
00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:04.880 align:start position:0%
make religious-based choices for
 
00:20:08.590 --> 00:20:08.600 align:start position:0%
themselves but not to use that power of
 
00:20:11.709 --> 00:20:11.719 align:start position:0%
the government to apply those choices to
 
00:20:15.669 --> 00:20:15.679 align:start position:0%
others this bill supported and sponsored
 
00:20:18.110 --> 00:20:18.120 align:start position:0%
by legislators across party and policy
 
00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
lines requires an expectation of death
 
00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:23.360 align:start position:0%
within six months
 
00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
absolute mental
 
00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
competency the testimony of two
 
00:20:30.229 --> 00:20:30.239 align:start position:0%
independent medical professionals and a
 
00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:33.520 align:start position:0%
short waiting period it would provide no

two reasons I'll ommit the duplication

the appointed time notified the local

limited government intervention I hope

they stand up and support their words
 
00:23:46.189 --> 00:23:46.199 align:start position:0%
when this bill comes to the floor I have
 
00:23:48.270 --> 00:23:48.280 align:start position:0%
had many family members who have had a
 
00:23:50.189 --> 00:23:50.199 align:start position:0%
much greater quality of life and R
 
00:23:53.669 --> 00:23:53.679 align:start position:0%
respectful passing in their law

00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:54.480 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:23:56.550 --> 00:23:56.560 align:start position:0%
recently just a few months ago as a
 
00:23:57.790 --> 00:23:57.800 align:start position:0%
matter of fact my brother had to be
 
00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:00.480 align:start position:0%
moved by ambulance from One hospital to
 
00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:04.320 align:start position:0%
another two states away so that he would
 
00:24:06.870 --> 00:24:06.880 align:start position:0%
be allowed and I would be allowed as his
 
00:24:09.709 --> 00:24:09.719 align:start position:0%
provider to assist his medical Aid and
 
00:24:12.270 --> 00:24:12.280 align:start position:0%
dying I won't go in the details of his
 
00:24:13.709 --> 00:24:13.719 align:start position:0%
decline but it was horrific and
 
00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:16.000 align:start position:0%
devastating to observe the best I could
 
00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
do was abide by his final wishes and
 
00:24:19.870 --> 00:24:19.880 align:start position:0%
thank goodness he had made the proper
 
00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:21.520 align:start position:0%
legal medical preparation for that
 
00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
moment this did not make the pain for
 
00:24:26.070 --> 00:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
his passing any easier but for me I
 
00:24:28.550 --> 00:24:28.560 align:start position:0%
trust it did for him members of the
 
00:24:30.430 --> 00:24:30.440 align:start position:0%
committee this bill is not about your
 
00:24:33.030 --> 00:24:33.040 align:start position:0%
religious beliefs no mine it's not about
 
00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:35.360 align:start position:0%
your political beliefs no mine but
 
00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:37.600 align:start position:0%
rather it's our friends neighbors and
 
00:24:39.709 --> 00:24:39.719 align:start position:0%
families who have to deal with terms and
 
00:24:43.030 --> 00:24:43.040 align:start position:0%
phrases like metastized inoperable
 
00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:46.320 align:start position:0%
throughout your body stage four this is
 
00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:48.320 align:start position:0%
their reality there are no Health

00:24:53.070 --> 00:24:53.080 align:start position:0%
the dock the only remaining is final
 
00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
care options Medical Aid and dying and
 
00:24:57.790 --> 00:24:57.800 align:start position:0%
of Life options should not be seen
 
00:24:59.350 --> 00:24:59.360 align:start position:0%
through the lens of religious or
 
00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
political movement of position it is
 
00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
simply the right of a terminally ill
 
00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:06.360 align:start position:0%

00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:28.480 align:start position:0%
right I'm here representing New
 
00:29:29.709 --> 00:29:29.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire right to life and all our
 
00:29:32.109 --> 00:29:32.119 align:start position:0%
supports across the
 
00:29:34.470 --> 00:29:34.480 align:start position:0%
state secondly you have written
 
00:29:36.030 --> 00:29:36.040 align:start position:0%
testimony from New Hampshire right to
 
00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:37.360 align:start position:0%
life there's a little packet from in
 
00:29:39.870 --> 00:29:39.880 align:start position:0%
front of each of you has four documents
 
00:29:42.030 --> 00:29:42.040 align:start position:0%
one is that written testimony one is a
 
00:29:44.510 --> 00:29:44.520 align:start position:0%
table of suicide deaths from Canada for
 
00:29:46.990 --> 00:29:47.000 align:start position:0%
the last 10 or 12 year from Oregon for
 
00:29:49.550 --> 00:29:49.560 align:start position:0%
the last 10 or 12 years one is a handout
 
00:29:51.709 --> 00:29:51.719 align:start position:0%
about Canada and the timeline that took
 
00:29:56.750 --> 00:29:56.760 align:start position:0%
get get to where they are and uh one is
 
00:29:58.950 --> 00:29:58.960 align:start position:0%
uh we asked our friends at New National
 
00:30:00.590 --> 00:30:00.600 align:start position:0%
right to life to analyze this bill in
 
00:30:03.070 --> 00:30:03.080 align:start position:0%
light of national laws and they did that
 
00:30:05.750 --> 00:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
and there's a several page analysis of
 
00:30:08.070 --> 00:30:08.080 align:start position:0%
that as part of that
 
00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:11.360 align:start position:0%
packet what I want to say today is
 
00:30:14.109 --> 00:30:14.119 align:start position:0%
suicide is not Health Care it never will
 
00:30:17.030 --> 00:30:17.040 align:start position:0%
be Health Care at the last
 
00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
minute it's a voluntary choice on the
 
00:30:22.510 --> 00:30:22.520 align:start position:0%
part of the individual
 
00:30:26.629 --> 00:30:26.639 align:start position:0%
which is the very definition of
 
00:30:29.270 --> 00:30:29.280 align:start position:0%
suicide it's a slippery
 
00:30:32.149 --> 00:30:32.159 align:start position:0%
slope a very slippery
 
00:30:34.430 --> 00:30:34.440 align:start position:0%
slope the Netherlands started with
 
00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:38.480 align:start position:0%
assisted suicide 50 odd years
 
00:30:40.430 --> 00:30:40.440 align:start position:0%
ago over
 
00:30:44.590 --> 00:30:44.600 align:start position:0%
time it expanded it expanded without any
 
00:30:47.950 --> 00:30:47.960 align:start position:0%
changes to the law their law started out
 
00:30:52.390 --> 00:30:52.400 align:start position:0%
narrow like ours did is but expanded
 
00:30:55.109 --> 00:30:55.119 align:start position:0%
without changes to the law why because
 
00:30:58.590 --> 00:30:58.600 align:start position:0%
it State sanctions suicide and when the
 
00:31:01.350 --> 00:31:01.360 align:start position:0%
state gives it sanction when we call it
 
00:31:05.390 --> 00:31:05.400 align:start position:0%
Medical Care medical professionals are
 
00:31:07.629 --> 00:31:07.639 align:start position:0%
influenced by
 
00:31:11.910 --> 00:31:11.920 align:start position:0%
that they want care for their clients
 
00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
patients and so the person is close to
 
00:31:19.550 --> 00:31:19.560 align:start position:0%
death we all know it and isn't it better
 
00:31:23.709 --> 00:31:23.719 align:start position:0%
to just increase the medic ation just
 
00:31:26.229 --> 00:31:26.239 align:start position:0%
whatever and so but that just became
 
00:31:28.550 --> 00:31:28.560 align:start position:0%
accepted as medical practices there was
 
00:31:30.550 --> 00:31:30.560 align:start position:0%
no change to the
 
00:31:33.390 --> 00:31:33.400 align:start position:0%
law and it
 
00:31:37.830 --> 00:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
took 40 plus years for them to actually
 
00:31:42.310 --> 00:31:42.320 align:start position:0%
change the law but suicide expand
 
00:31:45.590 --> 00:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
Medical Aid expanded
 
00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:50.270 align:start position:0%
Medical Aid expanded
anyway

00:31:50.270 --> 00:31:50.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:53.550 --> 00:31:53.560 align:start position:0%
why because the there were court cases
 
00:31:56.629 --> 00:31:56.639 align:start position:0%
every restriction in this law every
 
00:31:59.109 --> 00:31:59.119 align:start position:0%
single one can be challenged in the
 
00:32:00.990 --> 00:32:01.000 align:start position:0%
court of law why do you have to have a
 
00:32:02.709 --> 00:32:02.719 align:start position:0%
terminal illness why does it have to be
 
00:32:06.470 --> 00:32:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:08.910 --> 00:32:08.920 align:start position:0%
else and you know what courts can't
 
00:32:11.470 --> 00:32:11.480 align:start position:0%
decide these things and so the courts
 
00:32:13.629 --> 00:32:13.639 align:start position:0%
always ruled you could expand you could
 
00:32:16.189 --> 00:32:16.199 align:start position:0%
expand you could expand and so it did
 
00:32:19.270 --> 00:32:19.280 align:start position:0%
this is again without any changes to the
 
00:32:21.709 --> 00:32:21.719 align:start position:0%
law and eventually they did legalize
 
00:32:23.510 --> 00:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
euthanasia and now it's worse than it
 
00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:24.709 align:start position:0%
euthanasia and now it's worse than it
was

00:32:24.709 --> 00:32:24.719 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:32:27.709 --> 00:32:27.719 align:start position:0%
before but it's spreading around the
 
00:32:30.070 --> 00:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
world so we'll talk about Canada just
 
00:32:33.990 --> 00:32:34.000 align:start position:0%
for a minute it took Canada seven years
 
00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:38.320 align:start position:0%
to get to the place where Canada took 50
 
00:32:41.669 --> 00:32:41.679 align:start position:0%
years and now Canada along with the
 
00:32:43.629 --> 00:32:43.639 align:start position:0%
Netherlands are leading the world in how
 
00:32:46.990 --> 00:32:47.000 align:start position:0%
many people can commit suicide and they
 
00:32:48.870 --> 00:32:48.880 align:start position:0%
they wanted to extend it to the mental e
 
00:32:51.669 --> 00:32:51.679 align:start position:0%
last week last week they were going to
 
00:32:54.590 --> 00:32:54.600 align:start position:0%
going to expand it to me the mental eill
 
00:32:56.830 --> 00:32:56.840 align:start position:0%
you could you can commit suicide just
 
00:32:59.750 --> 00:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
because you're mental ill right Wolford
 
00:33:01.790 --> 00:33:01.800 align:start position:0%
you're you're uh I think you're beyond
 
00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:04.480 align:start position:0%
your two minutes uh okay so I ask you to
 
00:33:08.790 --> 00:33:08.800 align:start position:0%
consider this who benefits from this now
 
00:33:12.510 --> 00:33:12.520 align:start position:0%
who benefits from it as time goes on and
 
00:33:14.189 --> 00:33:14.199 align:start position:0%
can we live with State sanctions
 
00:33:17.229 --> 00:33:17.239 align:start position:0%
assisted suicide I say the answer is no
 
00:33:19.830 --> 00:33:19.840 align:start position:0%
and I ask you iail this Bill thank you
 
00:33:22.750 --> 00:33:22.760 align:start position:0%

morning colleagues and friends for the
 
00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
record my name is Linda H Haskins I
 
00:33:50.510 --> 00:33:50.520 align:start position:0%
represent sorry about that I represent
 
00:33:53.270 --> 00:33:53.280 align:start position:0%
Rockingham 11
 
00:33:56.430 --> 00:33:56.440 align:start position:0%
exer I'm a co-sponsor on this bill
 
00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
because I believe it is a common sense
 
00:34:01.990 --> 00:34:02.000 align:start position:0%
solution to a
 
00:34:04.910 --> 00:34:04.920 align:start position:0%
heartache that has caused many families
 
00:34:09.669 --> 00:34:09.679 align:start position:0%
to regret how their loved one died I
 
00:34:12.669 --> 00:34:12.679 align:start position:0%
want this not only for myself but for
 
00:34:16.430 --> 00:34:16.440 align:start position:0%
all my loved ones and for all of you
 
00:34:19.669 --> 00:34:19.679 align:start position:0%
many of us know someone who has died a
 
00:34:22.109 --> 00:34:22.119 align:start position:0%
painful death
 
00:34:24.070 --> 00:34:24.080 align:start position:0%
although we may be living
 
00:34:27.270 --> 00:34:27.280 align:start position:0%
longer than previous generations for
 
00:34:32.669 --> 00:34:32.679 align:start position:0%
many terminal patience the end of life
 
00:34:35.350 --> 00:34:35.360 align:start position:0%
is filled with needless
 
00:34:38.709 --> 00:34:38.719 align:start position:0%
suffering and pain for them and their
 
00:34:38.719 --> 00:34:39.590 align:start position:0%
suffering and pain for them and their
loved

00:34:39.590 --> 00:34:39.600 align:start position:0%
loved
 
00:34:42.669 --> 00:34:42.679 align:start position:0%
ones we can do
 
00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
better dying a slow painful
 
00:34:50.830 --> 00:34:50.840 align:start position:0%
death an inevitable death is not what we
 
00:34:54.629 --> 00:34:54.639 align:start position:0%
want for our ourselves or those we love
 
00:34:58.550 --> 00:34:58.560 align:start position:0%
but sadly that is the reality for many
 
00:35:03.270 --> 00:35:03.280 align:start position:0%
families we will all experience grief in
 
00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:07.280 align:start position:0%
losing a loved one what this bill does
 
00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
is to eliminate suffering for terminal
 
00:35:14.430 --> 00:35:14.440 align:start position:0%
patients the bill has been carefully
 
00:35:17.189 --> 00:35:17.199 align:start position:0%
crafted with the guidelines and guard
 
00:35:20.910 --> 00:35:20.920 align:start position:0%
rails to ensure that adults with a
 
00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:23.590 align:start position:0%
rails to ensure that adults with a
terminal

00:35:23.590 --> 00:35:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:27.709 --> 00:35:27.719 align:start position:0%
illness can choose to die in peace
 
00:35:30.270 --> 00:35:30.280 align:start position:0%
rather than connected to tubes and
 
00:35:32.629 --> 00:35:32.639 align:start position:0%
machines in a hospital
 
00:35:36.070 --> 00:35:36.080 align:start position:0%
setting my own mother was transferred
 
00:35:40.189 --> 00:35:40.199 align:start position:0%
from a local facility to Mass
 
00:35:43.669 --> 00:35:43.679 align:start position:0%
General where she Lay Dying For weeks
 
00:35:45.629 --> 00:35:45.639 align:start position:0%
tended by well-meaning
 
00:35:48.149 --> 00:35:48.159 align:start position:0%
strangers while her children were kept
 
00:35:51.149 --> 00:35:51.159 align:start position:0%
outside her room and only allowed to
 
00:35:53.590 --> 00:35:53.600 align:start position:0%
visit visit at designated times
 
00:35:55.910 --> 00:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
representative you're you're uh getting
 
00:35:57.910 --> 00:35:57.920 align:start position:0%
close to your limit thank you there was
 
00:36:00.950 --> 00:36:00.960 align:start position:0%
no dignity in her death it was not what
 
00:36:03.430 --> 00:36:03.440 align:start position:0%
she would have chosen and it was not
 
00:36:06.149 --> 00:36:06.159 align:start position:0%
what we would have chosen for her I urge
 
00:36:08.990 --> 00:36:09.000 align:start position:0%
you to support this bill and send it to

hi hi thank you Mr
 
00:36:36.310 --> 00:36:36.320 align:start position:0%
chairman I'm Bill Palmer I represent
 
00:36:38.390 --> 00:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
Sullivan District 2 which is Cornish in
 
00:36:41.430 --> 00:36:41.440 align:start position:0%
planfield and I'm here testifying today
 
00:36:43.109 --> 00:36:43.119 align:start position:0%
because I've been a hospice medical
 
00:36:46.109 --> 00:36:46.119 align:start position:0%
director for 28 years and am now still a
 
00:36:48.350 --> 00:36:48.360 align:start position:0%
hospitalist delivering significant
 
00:36:50.270 --> 00:36:50.280 align:start position:0%
amounts of hospice
 
00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:51.870 align:start position:0%
amounts of hospice
care

00:36:51.870 --> 00:36:51.880 align:start position:0%
care
 
00:36:55.350 --> 00:36:55.360 align:start position:0%
um I think you'll hear a lot about
 
00:36:59.229 --> 00:36:59.239 align:start position:0%
um rationale for this bill my experience
 
00:37:01.830 --> 00:37:01.840 align:start position:0%
working in Vermont most of the time over
 
00:37:04.590 --> 00:37:04.600 align:start position:0%
the last uh 10 years when act 39 has
 
00:37:06.229 --> 00:37:06.239 align:start position:0%
been in
 
00:37:09.709 --> 00:37:09.719 align:start position:0%
effect has been that this is a rarely
 
00:37:09.719 --> 00:37:11.790 align:start position:0%
effect has been that this is a rarely
accessed

00:37:11.790 --> 00:37:11.800 align:start position:0%
accessed
 
00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:16.480 align:start position:0%
um uh option but a very vital one um
 
00:37:18.270 --> 00:37:18.280 align:start position:0%
quite a number of patients will ask
 
00:37:21.709 --> 00:37:21.719 align:start position:0%
about it um very few end up pursuing it
 
00:37:24.149 --> 00:37:24.159 align:start position:0%
one of the most important things is that
 
00:37:26.669 --> 00:37:26.679 align:start position:0%
just having access gives people a lot of
 
00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
relief in my written testimony I've
 
00:37:33.310 --> 00:37:33.320 align:start position:0%
outlined a case of exactly that um I
 
00:37:34.750 --> 00:37:34.760 align:start position:0%
think the other thing that I'll say
 
00:37:37.830 --> 00:37:37.840 align:start position:0%
today is that there are certainly times
 
00:37:39.990 --> 00:37:40.000 align:start position:0%
when we've run through every possible
 
00:37:42.189 --> 00:37:42.199 align:start position:0%
option uh medical
 
00:37:45.350 --> 00:37:45.360 align:start position:0%
option spiritual option um getting
 
00:37:47.510 --> 00:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
families to visit people who are dying
 
00:37:50.470 --> 00:37:50.480 align:start position:0%
and who are in distress that this is one
 
00:37:53.149 --> 00:37:53.159 align:start position:0%
option that in Vermont really has made a
 
00:37:56.310 --> 00:37:56.320 align:start position:0%
vital difference in how people can relax
 
00:37:57.669 --> 00:37:57.679 align:start position:0%
and and
 
00:38:00.430 --> 00:38:00.440 align:start position:0%
really their sufferings alleviated just
 
00:38:03.790 --> 00:38:03.800 align:start position:0%
knowing that this is an option um I
 
00:38:05.709 --> 00:38:05.719 align:start position:0%
personally have only had one patient go
 
00:38:07.950 --> 00:38:07.960 align:start position:0%
all the way through the steps and take
 
00:38:10.270 --> 00:38:10.280 align:start position:0%
the medication out of hundreds and
 
00:38:12.910 --> 00:38:12.920 align:start position:0%
hundreds of of patients but many of them
 
00:38:15.589 --> 00:38:15.599 align:start position:0%
have experienced a great deal of relief
 
00:38:18.109 --> 00:38:18.119 align:start position:0%
just knowing that's that's the option so
 
00:38:20.830 --> 00:38:20.840 align:start position:0%
I hope you will support this bill and
 
00:38:24.510 --> 00:38:24.520 align:start position:0%
pass OTP out of this committee thank you
 
00:38:25.870 --> 00:38:25.880 align:start position:0%
questions for this
 
00:38:28.430 --> 00:38:28.440 align:start position:0%
witness thank you yes representative
 
00:38:30.350 --> 00:38:30.360 align:start position:0%
pess thank you thank you for taking my
 
00:38:32.750 --> 00:38:32.760 align:start position:0%
question uh you as a hospice physician
 
00:38:34.669 --> 00:38:34.679 align:start position:0%
is it my understanding if you go into
 
00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
Hospice Care um that you have to
 
00:38:42.750 --> 00:38:42.760 align:start position:0%
terminate all your opt all your care all
 
00:38:47.470 --> 00:38:47.480 align:start position:0%
your treatments so so this is always the
 
00:38:49.310 --> 00:38:49.320 align:start position:0%
problem with with the word hospice is
 
00:38:51.990 --> 00:38:52.000 align:start position:0%
there is a a Medicare benefit benef
 
00:38:54.629 --> 00:38:54.639 align:start position:0%
which is hospice medical benefit and
 
00:38:56.350 --> 00:38:56.360 align:start position:0%
other insurance companies recognize that
 
00:38:58.229 --> 00:38:58.239 align:start position:0%
and that is true of that but a lot of
 
00:39:00.390 --> 00:39:00.400 align:start position:0%
the patients like the patient in this um
 
00:39:04.709 --> 00:39:04.719 align:start position:0%
story that I'm I'll pass around um were
 
00:39:08.310 --> 00:39:08.320 align:start position:0%
on were obtaining pallative care they
 
00:39:11.470 --> 00:39:11.480 align:start position:0%
were on hospice and so basically their
 
00:39:13.790 --> 00:39:13.800 align:start position:0%
whole Focus was on Comfort not on any
 
00:39:15.350 --> 00:39:15.360 align:start position:0%
further treatment but they weren't part
 
00:39:16.390 --> 00:39:16.400 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:39:19.229 --> 00:39:19.239 align:start position:0%
Medicare official hospice program
 
00:39:21.589 --> 00:39:21.599 align:start position:0%
followup yes it's my understanding
 
00:39:24.109 --> 00:39:24.119 align:start position:0%
I was a nurse for 42 years I watched
 
00:39:26.270 --> 00:39:26.280 align:start position:0%
people die I worked intensive care I
 
00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:27.510 align:start position:0%
people die I worked intensive care I
worked

00:39:27.510 --> 00:39:27.520 align:start position:0%
worked
 
00:39:30.390 --> 00:39:30.400 align:start position:0%
cardiac it's my understanding that Pala
 
00:39:32.629 --> 00:39:32.639 align:start position:0%
of care and hospice care are very
 
00:39:34.750 --> 00:39:34.760 align:start position:0%
different hospice
 
00:39:37.629 --> 00:39:37.639 align:start position:0%
care technically according to your your
 
00:39:40.470 --> 00:39:40.480 align:start position:0%
insurance and and Medicaid you no longer
 
00:39:44.030 --> 00:39:44.040 align:start position:0%
can receive treatment for your ailment
 
00:39:46.310 --> 00:39:46.320 align:start position:0%
paliative Care on the other hand which
 
00:39:50.070 --> 00:39:50.080 align:start position:0%
can start way before the six months you
 
00:39:53.790 --> 00:39:53.800 align:start position:0%
can receive all kinds of care you
 
00:39:56.589 --> 00:39:56.599 align:start position:0%
treatments for your um for your illness
 
00:40:00.629 --> 00:40:00.639 align:start position:0%
or condition along with um uh mental
 
00:40:03.550 --> 00:40:03.560 align:start position:0%
health and so all kinds of care so
 
00:40:05.910 --> 00:40:05.920 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding has that
 
00:40:08.229 --> 00:40:08.239 align:start position:0%
changed I think the way we talk about
 
00:40:09.470 --> 00:40:09.480 align:start position:0%
it's changed and I think there are
 
00:40:12.790 --> 00:40:12.800 align:start position:0%
people behind me who are um certified
 
00:40:15.430 --> 00:40:15.440 align:start position:0%
pallative and hospice care physicians
 
00:40:18.109 --> 00:40:18.119 align:start position:0%
who can probably talk to the details I'm
 
00:40:19.629 --> 00:40:19.639 align:start position:0%
probably a little bit oldfashioned and I
 
00:40:21.629 --> 00:40:21.639 align:start position:0%
sort of consider it hospice but I think
 
00:40:23.510 --> 00:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
most people now talk about paliative
 
00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
care which usually starts right with a
 
00:40:27.910 --> 00:40:27.920 align:start position:0%
diagnosis say of cancer or end stage
 
00:40:30.430 --> 00:40:30.440 align:start position:0%
long or heart disease and that and and
 
00:40:32.669 --> 00:40:32.679 align:start position:0%
the two things proceed in parallel so
 
00:40:34.430 --> 00:40:34.440 align:start position:0%
you're getting pallative care along with
 
00:40:36.430 --> 00:40:36.440 align:start position:0%
your chemotherapy and radiation therapy
 
00:40:39.950 --> 00:40:39.960 align:start position:0%
right and but the hospice medic Medicare
 
00:40:43.149 --> 00:40:43.159 align:start position:0%
bu does not allow that right it's it's
 
00:40:45.189 --> 00:40:45.199 align:start position:0%
right it's underused and it's a very
 
00:40:46.870 --> 00:40:46.880 align:start position:0%
specific thing my mother-in-law my
 
00:40:48.270 --> 00:40:48.280 align:start position:0%
mother was on it my mother-in-law's on
 
00:40:50.390 --> 00:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
it because they wanted to stay home and
 
00:40:52.470 --> 00:40:52.480 align:start position:0%
not go back to the hospital anymore and
 
00:40:54.589 --> 00:40:54.599 align:start position:0%
so that's where that one more quick
 
00:40:56.550 --> 00:40:56.560 align:start position:0%
followup yep you don't have to be in the
 
00:40:58.589 --> 00:40:58.599 align:start position:0%
hospital to receive Hospice Care is that
 
00:41:01.270 --> 00:41:01.280 align:start position:0%
care true right the whole a lot of the
 
00:41:03.629 --> 00:41:03.639 align:start position:0%
point of of the hospice benefit is to
 
00:41:05.950 --> 00:41:05.960 align:start position:0%
try and keep people at home or or where
 
00:41:07.629 --> 00:41:07.639 align:start position:0%
they want to be whether it's in at home
 
00:41:09.550 --> 00:41:09.560 align:start position:0%
or in a nursing home okay thank you very
 
00:41:11.229 --> 00:41:11.239 align:start position:0%
much thanks for taking my question other
 
00:41:13.350 --> 00:41:13.360 align:start position:0%
questions for this witness seeing none
 
00:41:16.030 --> 00:41:16.040 align:start position:0%
thank you very much sir uh next uh
 
00:41:19.430 --> 00:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
representative David rord and next uh
 
00:41:20.430 --> 00:41:20.440 align:start position:0%
the next one after that will be
 
00:41:22.629 --> 00:41:22.639 align:start position:0%
represent ative Gary
 
00:41:26.830 --> 00:41:26.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:28.950 --> 00:41:28.960 align:start position:0%
roord thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:41:30.510 --> 00:41:30.520 align:start position:0%
members of the committee uh my name is
 
00:41:32.430 --> 00:41:32.440 align:start position:0%
David Rochford I represent Grafton 1 I'm
 
00:41:34.669 --> 00:41:34.679 align:start position:0%
from Littleton uh I'm one of two
 
00:41:37.270 --> 00:41:37.280 align:start position:0%
pharmacists in the legislature here in
 
00:41:40.109 --> 00:41:40.119 align:start position:0%
conquer and I come here um not to take a
 
00:41:43.470 --> 00:41:43.480 align:start position:0%
position per se but to to point out a
 
00:41:46.790 --> 00:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
fairly uh obvious I assume unintentional
 
00:41:49.669 --> 00:41:49.679 align:start position:0%
Omission in the legislation and uh the
 
00:41:51.910 --> 00:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
Omission it if you could follow along
 
00:41:54.350 --> 00:41:54.360 align:start position:0%
with me begins on page six lines 6
 
00:41:57.310 --> 00:41:57.320 align:start position:0%
through 10 when it talks about the
 
00:42:00.229 --> 00:42:00.239 align:start position:0%
indemnification of uh health care and
 
00:42:02.350 --> 00:42:02.360 align:start position:0%
I'm going to use the quotes health care
 
00:42:06.109 --> 00:42:06.119 align:start position:0%
providers who are participating in this
 
00:42:06.119 --> 00:42:06.950 align:start position:0%
providers who are participating in this
uh

00:42:06.950 --> 00:42:06.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:42:09.510 --> 00:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
activity um and it talks about no
 
00:42:11.109 --> 00:42:11.119 align:start position:0%
healthc care providers who you know
 
00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:13.440 align:start position:0%
there can be a conscientious objection
 
00:42:16.709 --> 00:42:16.719 align:start position:0%
as well uh and if you go to
 
00:42:22.109 --> 00:42:22.119 align:start position:0%
page one um line 15 where defines Health
 
00:42:25.350 --> 00:42:25.360 align:start position:0%
Care Providers talks about Physicians
 
00:42:28.109 --> 00:42:28.119 align:start position:0%
osteopathic Physicians advanced practice
 
00:42:30.430 --> 00:42:30.440 align:start position:0%
registered nurses Physicians assistants
 
00:42:33.550 --> 00:42:33.560 align:start position:0%
and talks about those who are authorized
 
00:42:36.910 --> 00:42:36.920 align:start position:0%
to prescribe medications and I would ask
 
00:42:38.229 --> 00:42:38.239 align:start position:0%
because pharmacists are going to play a
 
00:42:42.629 --> 00:42:42.639 align:start position:0%
role in this that we add on line 16
 
00:42:45.669 --> 00:42:45.679 align:start position:0%
prescribe or dispense
 
00:42:48.950 --> 00:42:48.960 align:start position:0%
medications and then on line make a new
 
00:42:52.470 --> 00:42:52.480 align:start position:0%
line 21 where 20 is and add uh a
 
00:43:00.350 --> 00:43:00.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:05.030 --> 00:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
318 I would also suggest on within the
 
00:43:07.870 --> 00:43:07.880 align:start position:0%
definitions is defining a dispensing
 
00:43:11.990 --> 00:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
health care provider means and add that
 
00:43:16.589 --> 00:43:16.599 align:start position:0%
to the uh um to to the bill
 
00:43:19.149 --> 00:43:19.159 align:start position:0%
um and of course in and you know when I
 
00:43:20.430 --> 00:43:20.440 align:start position:0%
first thought of that I thought maybe
 
00:43:22.550 --> 00:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
far weren't included in this but they
 
00:43:24.790 --> 00:43:24.800 align:start position:0%
clearly are on page four and
 
00:43:26.189 --> 00:43:26.199 align:start position:0%
understanding how the mechanics of this
 
00:43:28.390 --> 00:43:28.400 align:start position:0%
works and familiar with how it works in
 
00:43:30.270 --> 00:43:30.280 align:start position:0%
Vermont U the pharmacist will be
 
00:43:32.910 --> 00:43:32.920 align:start position:0%
participating in this so I think before
 
00:43:35.270 --> 00:43:35.280 align:start position:0%
the committee if anything happens at
 
00:43:37.589 --> 00:43:37.599 align:start position:0%
this committee before it goes across the
 
00:43:40.109 --> 00:43:40.119 align:start position:0%
street um we just take into
 
00:43:42.030 --> 00:43:42.040 align:start position:0%
consideration that dispensing is the
 
00:43:44.270 --> 00:43:44.280 align:start position:0%
first half or prescribing is the first
 
00:43:47.030 --> 00:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
half but dispensing is the second half
 
00:43:49.390 --> 00:43:49.400 align:start position:0%
of this uh and that's all I had is just
 
00:43:52.830 --> 00:43:52.840 align:start position:0%
those requests for for fix it yes
 
00:43:55.270 --> 00:43:55.280 align:start position:0%
questions representative Perez thank you
 
00:43:57.709 --> 00:43:57.719 align:start position:0%
as a pharmacist I had a concern about
 
00:44:00.589 --> 00:44:00.599 align:start position:0%
the fact that I'll give you an example
 
00:44:03.910 --> 00:44:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:08.189 --> 00:44:08.199 align:start position:0%
um having people um the death sentence
 
00:44:11.830 --> 00:44:11.840 align:start position:0%
okay we found that things were cruel and
 
00:44:14.070 --> 00:44:14.080 align:start position:0%
abusive and we couldn't do them and that
 
00:44:15.830 --> 00:44:15.840 align:start position:0%
when they had Lethal Injections they
 
00:44:18.990 --> 00:44:19.000 align:start position:0%
found that those Lethal Injections were
 
00:44:22.149 --> 00:44:22.159 align:start position:0%
cruel and abusive my con concern is that
 
00:44:24.390 --> 00:44:24.400 align:start position:0%
there is no definition in here not
 
00:44:27.629 --> 00:44:27.639 align:start position:0%
saying what the drugs are but stating
 
00:44:33.109 --> 00:44:33.119 align:start position:0%
that um current um practice medications
 
00:44:36.750 --> 00:44:36.760 align:start position:0%
because what people are using today may
 
00:44:38.709 --> 00:44:38.719 align:start position:0%
be entirely different than what they're
 
00:44:40.910 --> 00:44:40.920 align:start position:0%
using three years from now do you
 
00:44:42.270 --> 00:44:42.280 align:start position:0%
understand what I'm saying yeah I
 
00:44:43.950 --> 00:44:43.960 align:start position:0%
understand that and so but there's
 
00:44:47.189 --> 00:44:47.199 align:start position:0%
nothing in here that says anything about
 
00:44:50.589 --> 00:44:50.599 align:start position:0%
what is being prescribed and um that
 
00:44:52.229 --> 00:44:52.239 align:start position:0%
that's a concern do you see that as a
 
00:44:54.709 --> 00:44:54.719 align:start position:0%
pharmacist being a concern well I think
 
00:44:54.719 --> 00:44:55.950 align:start position:0%
pharmacist being a concern well I think
that

00:44:55.950 --> 00:44:55.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:44:59.910 --> 00:44:59.920 align:start position:0%
uh if I may uh um and and and I'm not
 
00:45:03.189 --> 00:45:03.199 align:start position:0%
you know this is not a endorsing or or
 
00:45:05.470 --> 00:45:05.480 align:start position:0%
or otherwise of the legislation I think
 
00:45:07.830 --> 00:45:07.840 align:start position:0%
anytime you get so granular and so
 
00:45:09.589 --> 00:45:09.599 align:start position:0%
specific in the legislation as about
 
00:45:11.470 --> 00:45:11.480 align:start position:0%
what agent has to be used what drug has
 
00:45:12.990 --> 00:45:13.000 align:start position:0%
to be us that's not what I'm asking okay
 
00:45:14.990 --> 00:45:15.000 align:start position:0%
all right May I'm asking that it say
 
00:45:19.149 --> 00:45:19.159 align:start position:0%
something about uh not current but um
 
00:45:20.589 --> 00:45:20.599 align:start position:0%
well oh I see what you're saying Medical
 
00:45:23.030 --> 00:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
current medical according to current
 
00:45:25.830 --> 00:45:25.840 align:start position:0%
medical practice or whatever um that's
 
00:45:30.070 --> 00:45:30.080 align:start position:0%
not the term I want to use um um so that
 
00:45:31.390 --> 00:45:31.400 align:start position:0%
it can
 
00:45:35.070 --> 00:45:35.080 align:start position:0%
change it can change and be updated
 
00:45:36.910 --> 00:45:36.920 align:start position:0%
without there being an issue to the
 
00:45:39.390 --> 00:45:39.400 align:start position:0%
pharmacist or to the physician sure and
 
00:45:41.109 --> 00:45:41.119 align:start position:0%
I think I I think that's a that's a good
 
00:45:44.229 --> 00:45:44.239 align:start position:0%
point um that you bring up and uh that
 
00:45:46.709 --> 00:45:46.719 align:start position:0%
may be you know something to consider uh
 
00:45:48.390 --> 00:45:48.400 align:start position:0%
as you as the committee works works
 
00:45:51.189 --> 00:45:51.199 align:start position:0%
through the details of this thank you
 
00:45:53.030 --> 00:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
other questions for this
 
00:45:55.189 --> 00:45:55.199 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you very much
 
00:45:57.669 --> 00:45:57.679 align:start position:0%
thank you all right uh representative
 
00:46:00.070 --> 00:46:00.080 align:start position:0%
Gary Merchant and the next uh witness
 
00:46:02.030 --> 00:46:02.040 align:start position:0%
after that will be representative uh
 
00:46:10.910 --> 00:46:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:13.669 --> 00:46:13.679 align:start position:0%
O'Brien good morning Mr chairman and
 
00:46:15.790 --> 00:46:15.800 align:start position:0%
also the committee uh for the record my
 
00:46:17.070 --> 00:46:17.080 align:start position:0%
name is Gary Merchant representing
 
00:46:18.990 --> 00:46:19.000 align:start position:0%
selvan County district 6 which is the
 
00:46:21.390 --> 00:46:21.400 align:start position:0%
proud towns of Claremont and
 
00:46:24.350 --> 00:46:24.360 align:start position:0%
I won't um repeat what representative
 
00:46:26.149 --> 00:46:26.159 align:start position:0%
roord said he's also a pharmacist like
 
00:46:28.229 --> 00:46:28.239 align:start position:0%
myself I think he spoke to the issues we
 
00:46:30.430 --> 00:46:30.440 align:start position:0%
have as far as the pharmacy community
 
00:46:31.950 --> 00:46:31.960 align:start position:0%
that somehow the bill does include
 
00:46:33.990 --> 00:46:34.000 align:start position:0%
reference for the dispenser as well as
 
00:46:36.550 --> 00:46:36.560 align:start position:0%
the prescriber so I want to be sure that
 
00:46:38.229 --> 00:46:38.239 align:start position:0%
that's taken care if we can within the
 
00:46:40.510 --> 00:46:40.520 align:start position:0%
bill or some sort of an amendment I do
 
00:46:44.550 --> 00:46:44.560 align:start position:0%
come in support of the bill um I have
 
00:46:45.990 --> 00:46:46.000 align:start position:0%
worked as a hospice pharmacist I have
 
00:46:47.189 --> 00:46:47.199 align:start position:0%
seen like a lot of folks around this
 
00:46:50.149 --> 00:46:50.159 align:start position:0%
table patients die um and it's it's a
 
00:46:52.390 --> 00:46:52.400 align:start position:0%
lot of of agne particular in the family
 
00:46:55.390 --> 00:46:55.400 align:start position:0%
and a lot of times there are family
 
00:46:58.550 --> 00:46:58.560 align:start position:0%
members like the patient who really want
 
00:47:00.149 --> 00:47:00.159 align:start position:0%
to put the
 
00:47:03.149 --> 00:47:03.159 align:start position:0%
person in the place they're going to go
 
00:47:07.229 --> 00:47:07.239 align:start position:0%
in a timely way and a kind way and not
 
00:47:09.629 --> 00:47:09.639 align:start position:0%
through a lot of agne to watch as the
 
00:47:12.830 --> 00:47:12.840 align:start position:0%
nurse said Mr perz represent Perez it's
 
00:47:15.310 --> 00:47:15.320 align:start position:0%
hard it's harder on the family sometimes
 
00:47:17.550 --> 00:47:17.560 align:start position:0%
and the patient and I think one of the
 
00:47:20.910 --> 00:47:20.920 align:start position:0%
things to think about is that when you
 
00:47:23.310 --> 00:47:23.320 align:start position:0%
are looking at this from the patient's
 
00:47:25.390 --> 00:47:25.400 align:start position:0%
point of view it's really an option it's
 
00:47:27.750 --> 00:47:27.760 align:start position:0%
not something that they have to do and I
 
00:47:30.870 --> 00:47:30.880 align:start position:0%
can share with you having been involved
 
00:47:33.589 --> 00:47:33.599 align:start position:0%
with hospice in going into a patient's
 
00:47:36.950 --> 00:47:36.960 align:start position:0%
home to clean out the med
 
00:47:39.750 --> 00:47:39.760 align:start position:0%
cabinet there are drugs in the med
 
00:47:41.790 --> 00:47:41.800 align:start position:0%
cabinet that are completely
 
00:47:45.229 --> 00:47:45.239 align:start position:0%
empty no one prescribed it that way but
 
00:47:48.109 --> 00:47:48.119 align:start position:0%
it happens because the ones who are of
 
00:47:50.910 --> 00:47:50.920 align:start position:0%
the know understand how to use the drugs
 
00:47:53.430 --> 00:47:53.440 align:start position:0%
as a professor said to me once upon a
 
00:47:56.270 --> 00:47:56.280 align:start position:0%
time every single drug is a poison with
 
00:47:58.350 --> 00:47:58.360 align:start position:0%
therapeutic side effects the only thing
 
00:48:00.550 --> 00:48:00.560 align:start position:0%
that separates the poison from a drug
 
00:48:03.830 --> 00:48:03.840 align:start position:0%
with beneficial benefits is the dose so
 
00:48:06.990 --> 00:48:07.000 align:start position:0%
patients who understand that aspect have
 
00:48:09.350 --> 00:48:09.360 align:start position:0%
it available per se to them today but
 
00:48:11.229 --> 00:48:11.239 align:start position:0%
they don't have the opportunity to talk
 
00:48:13.149 --> 00:48:13.159 align:start position:0%
to a healthcare provider about that
 
00:48:15.430 --> 00:48:15.440 align:start position:0%
option unless you're like I said have
 
00:48:17.109 --> 00:48:17.119 align:start position:0%
somebody in the family who understands
 
00:48:19.709 --> 00:48:19.719 align:start position:0%
that so therefore if you can correct the
 
00:48:19.719 --> 00:48:20.910 align:start position:0%
that so therefore if you can correct the
bill

00:48:20.910 --> 00:48:20.920 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:48:23.149 --> 00:48:23.159 align:start position:0%
so the dispensers are actually included
 
00:48:25.510 --> 00:48:25.520 align:start position:0%
and also think about the patients
 
00:48:27.229 --> 00:48:27.239 align:start position:0%
themselves and the family members and
 
00:48:28.629 --> 00:48:28.639 align:start position:0%
the acting they go through when they're
 
00:48:30.830 --> 00:48:30.840 align:start position:0%
dying thank you questions for this
 
00:48:33.430 --> 00:48:33.440 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none representa I wonder
 
00:48:36.950 --> 00:48:36.960 align:start position:0%
if I could uh press you and maybe the
 
00:48:39.189 --> 00:48:39.199 align:start position:0%
prior witness because of your expertise
 
00:48:41.950 --> 00:48:41.960 align:start position:0%
into service and just ask you if you
 
00:48:45.310 --> 00:48:45.320 align:start position:0%
could perhaps uh think about exactly the
 
00:48:46.709 --> 00:48:46.719 align:start position:0%
language that you think should go in
 
00:48:49.149 --> 00:48:49.159 align:start position:0%
there and maybe then send me send me an
 
00:48:50.950 --> 00:48:50.960 align:start position:0%
email with that language
 
00:48:53.149 --> 00:48:53.159 align:start position:0%
uh uh so that we I mean obviously we're
 
00:48:54.669 --> 00:48:54.679 align:start position:0%
going to discuss it in the committee but
 
00:48:56.109 --> 00:48:56.119 align:start position:0%
it it sounds like that might you know
 
00:48:58.189 --> 00:48:58.199 align:start position:0%
make some sense to put that what you
 
00:48:59.589 --> 00:48:59.599 align:start position:0%
what the two of you have suggested into
 
00:49:01.589 --> 00:49:01.599 align:start position:0%
the bill chairman Lyn I'd be more than
 
00:49:03.189 --> 00:49:03.199 align:start position:0%

things she's one of my closest friends
 
00:50:35.950 --> 00:50:35.960 align:start position:0%
ever but it was also about the rest of
 
00:50:38.390 --> 00:50:38.400 align:start position:0%
the family being able to tell her that
 
00:50:40.910 --> 00:50:40.920 align:start position:0%
and other people in our family seeing
 
00:50:43.229 --> 00:50:43.239 align:start position:0%
that that how much we loved her and
 
00:50:45.709 --> 00:50:45.719 align:start position:0%
valued her
 
00:50:48.910 --> 00:50:48.920 align:start position:0%
um and this is healthy this is healthy
 
00:50:51.550 --> 00:50:51.560 align:start position:0%
for Society for children to see
 
00:50:54.189 --> 00:50:54.199 align:start position:0%
this I I uh I read a book a long time
 
00:50:56.629 --> 00:50:56.639 align:start position:0%
ago by Cheryl sanberg about leaning in
 
00:50:58.510 --> 00:50:58.520 align:start position:0%
she talked about the concept of leaning
 
00:51:02.589 --> 00:51:02.599 align:start position:0%
in and um taking advantage of
 
00:51:02.599 --> 00:51:03.830 align:start position:0%
in and um taking advantage of
opportunities

00:51:03.830 --> 00:51:03.840 align:start position:0%
opportunities
 
00:51:06.229 --> 00:51:06.239 align:start position:0%
professionally for women and it was a
 
00:51:08.310 --> 00:51:08.320 align:start position:0%
really interesting concept but I see I
 
00:51:10.510 --> 00:51:10.520 align:start position:0%
see the larger picture of our society we
 
00:51:12.310 --> 00:51:12.320 align:start position:0%
should we have two choices we can lean
 
00:51:14.709 --> 00:51:14.719 align:start position:0%
in towards life or we can lean away from
 
00:51:17.669 --> 00:51:17.679 align:start position:0%
it and all the steps that we take and I
 
00:51:20.589 --> 00:51:20.599 align:start position:0%
felt like uh we were leaning in to life
 
00:51:23.270 --> 00:51:23.280 align:start position:0%
even though she was she was passing
 
00:51:25.950 --> 00:51:25.960 align:start position:0%
away and I think that as a society we
 
00:51:28.310 --> 00:51:28.320 align:start position:0%
should take every opportunity to keep
 
00:51:32.189 --> 00:51:32.199 align:start position:0%
leaning into life I know that um another
 
00:51:33.990 --> 00:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
uh witness here came and and talked
 
00:51:36.750 --> 00:51:36.760 align:start position:0%
about his work in the hospice industry
 
00:51:38.669 --> 00:51:38.679 align:start position:0%
and he didn't have many requests for it
 
00:51:40.870 --> 00:51:40.880 align:start position:0%
when you legalize something you uh
 
00:51:43.629 --> 00:51:43.639 align:start position:0%
approve of it as a society and you get
 
00:51:46.189 --> 00:51:46.199 align:start position:0%
more of it so it's rare now but I don't
 
00:51:47.910 --> 00:51:47.920 align:start position:0%
know that that would be the case I'm
 
00:51:49.589 --> 00:51:49.599 align:start position:0%
very concerned about what's happening in
 
00:51:52.870 --> 00:51:52.880 align:start position:0%
Canada where people with minor illnesses
 
00:51:55.629 --> 00:51:55.639 align:start position:0%
are are offered made Medical Aid and
 
00:51:58.030 --> 00:51:58.040 align:start position:0%
dying and that's unconscionable and
 
00:52:00.629 --> 00:52:00.639 align:start position:0%
although I think that people have the
 
00:52:02.709 --> 00:52:02.719 align:start position:0%
best intentions with this
 
00:52:06.229 --> 00:52:06.239 align:start position:0%
bill I think that it it could creep to
 
00:52:08.589 --> 00:52:08.599 align:start position:0%
what the situation is in Canada what we
 
00:52:10.350 --> 00:52:10.360 align:start position:0%
see in the Netherlands which is really
 
00:52:14.550 --> 00:52:14.560 align:start position:0%
unconscionable to to to um offer Aid and
 
00:52:17.069 --> 00:52:17.079 align:start position:0%
dying to a 28-year-old woman for
 
00:52:19.990 --> 00:52:20.000 align:start position:0%
fibromyalgia who's autistic that that's
 
00:52:21.910 --> 00:52:21.920 align:start position:0%
unconscionable those are those are other
 
00:52:23.430 --> 00:52:23.440 align:start position:0%
issues that could be solved that we
 
00:52:25.030 --> 00:52:25.040 align:start position:0%
could keep solving we don't need to tell
 
00:52:27.030 --> 00:52:27.040 align:start position:0%
these people they they they should leave
 
00:52:30.390 --> 00:52:30.400 align:start position:0%
that they should be killed un those are
 
00:52:32.669 --> 00:52:32.679 align:start position:0%
my concerns thank you so much thank you
 
00:52:35.870 --> 00:52:35.880 align:start position:0%
so much questions for this witness say
 
00:52:37.750 --> 00:52:37.760 align:start position:0%
none thank you very much thank you uh
 
00:52:48.229 --> 00:52:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:51.270 --> 00:52:51.280 align:start position:0%
Edinger you it with me
 
00:52:53.390 --> 00:52:53.400 align:start position:0%
sorry about that he's uh he was I tried
 
00:52:54.470 --> 00:52:54.480 align:start position:0%
to have my friend watch him and it
 
00:52:55.990 --> 00:52:56.000 align:start position:0%
didn't work out very well if you could
 
00:52:59.790 --> 00:52:59.800 align:start position:0%
hear so turn your microphone off oh
 
00:53:01.310 --> 00:53:01.320 align:start position:0%
there you go thank you okay sorry about
 
00:53:05.030 --> 00:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
that um so excuse my son I apologize uh
 
00:53:06.629 --> 00:53:06.639 align:start position:0%
but I've been a doctor for about 12
 
00:53:10.629 --> 00:53:10.639 align:start position:0%
years um I uh often work with people who
 
00:53:11.910 --> 00:53:11.920 align:start position:0%
are unfortunately at the end of their
 
00:53:14.470 --> 00:53:14.480 align:start position:0%
lives and I wasn't really sure how I
 
00:53:16.870 --> 00:53:16.880 align:start position:0%
felt about this bill until you know I
 
00:53:20.229 --> 00:53:20.239 align:start position:0%
thought about it some and then I uh and
 
00:53:23.990 --> 00:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
then I um uh talked to a several of my
 
00:53:25.750 --> 00:53:25.760 align:start position:0%
friends who also work in paliative care
 
00:53:28.510 --> 00:53:28.520 align:start position:0%
so they see many more patients than I do
 
00:53:29.790 --> 00:53:29.800 align:start position:0%
who are unfortunately at the end of
 
00:53:31.750 --> 00:53:31.760 align:start position:0%
their lives
 
00:53:34.149 --> 00:53:34.159 align:start position:0%
and I don't think that this bill is
 
00:53:35.709 --> 00:53:35.719 align:start position:0%
going to accomplish what it sets out to
 
00:53:40.310 --> 00:53:40.320 align:start position:0%
do because patients who who are
 
00:53:42.270 --> 00:53:42.280 align:start position:0%
diagnosed as terminal already are at the
 
00:53:46.990 --> 00:53:47.000 align:start position:0%
end of are are already uh sorry are
 
00:53:49.790 --> 00:53:49.800 align:start position:0%
already paliative uh are already hospice
 
00:53:51.270 --> 00:53:51.280 align:start position:0%
candidates and so if they are hospice
 
00:53:53.790 --> 00:53:53.800 align:start position:0%
candidates then often times they already
 
00:53:56.629 --> 00:53:56.639 align:start position:0%
have the means to you know if they
 
00:53:58.830 --> 00:53:58.840 align:start position:0%
wanted to to commit suicide they often
 
00:54:00.109 --> 00:54:00.119 align:start position:0%
have access to the sedatives the
 
00:54:01.910 --> 00:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
analgesics and the anti Medics oh thank
 
00:54:01.920 --> 00:54:03.189 align:start position:0%
analgesics and the anti Medics oh thank
you

00:54:03.189 --> 00:54:03.199 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:54:07.669 --> 00:54:07.679 align:start position:0%
B and and to and so they could if they
 
00:54:10.270 --> 00:54:10.280 align:start position:0%
wanted to but uh it is a fairly rare
 
00:54:12.589 --> 00:54:12.599 align:start position:0%
thing for patients to want to kill
 
00:54:14.750 --> 00:54:14.760 align:start position:0%
themselves I've never had a patient ask
 
00:54:17.189 --> 00:54:17.199 align:start position:0%
me about it I asked my paliative care
 
00:54:18.830 --> 00:54:18.840 align:start position:0%
doctor friends about it and they said
 
00:54:20.270 --> 00:54:20.280 align:start position:0%
that it was also
 
00:54:21.629 --> 00:54:21.639 align:start position:0%
somewhat rare but they could usually
 
00:54:23.030 --> 00:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
work through it because
 
00:54:26.149 --> 00:54:26.159 align:start position:0%
suicidality is not a disease in of
 
00:54:28.709 --> 00:54:28.719 align:start position:0%
itself it is a symptom of the disease
 
00:54:28.719 --> 00:54:30.030 align:start position:0%
itself it is a symptom of the disease
Christopher

00:54:30.030 --> 00:54:30.040 align:start position:0%
Christopher
 
00:54:33.669 --> 00:54:33.679 align:start position:0%
come and uh and it can usually be worked
 
00:54:35.430 --> 00:54:35.440 align:start position:0%
through because there's usually
 
00:54:38.589 --> 00:54:38.599 align:start position:0%
causative factors there's things such as
 
00:54:40.149 --> 00:54:40.159 align:start position:0%
uh uncontrolled pain uncontrolled
 
00:54:45.510 --> 00:54:45.520 align:start position:0%
discomfort things uh uh uh uncontrolled
 
00:54:47.669 --> 00:54:47.679 align:start position:0%
uh psychiatric diseases and just a lack
 
00:54:49.149 --> 00:54:49.159 align:start position:0%
of social and emotional support and
 
00:54:52.069 --> 00:54:52.079 align:start position:0%
doctors can can treat those things
 
00:54:55.109 --> 00:54:55.119 align:start position:0%
and and an even greater concern and so
 
00:54:57.629 --> 00:54:57.639 align:start position:0%
it undermines the medical of uh medical
 
00:55:00.069 --> 00:55:00.079 align:start position:0%
ethic of non-maleficence which is to do
 
00:55:02.750 --> 00:55:02.760 align:start position:0%
no harm and then furthermore I think
 
00:55:05.030 --> 00:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
that this bill might uh actually be a
 
00:55:07.629 --> 00:55:07.639 align:start position:0%
trojan horse perhaps unintentionally uh
 
00:55:09.390 --> 00:55:09.400 align:start position:0%
which representative Smith did sort of
 
00:55:10.950 --> 00:55:10.960 align:start position:0%
allude to when she said it was a toe in
 
00:55:14.310 --> 00:55:14.320 align:start position:0%
the water because when you legalize
 
00:55:16.750 --> 00:55:16.760 align:start position:0%
physician assisted suicide then you know
 
00:55:18.790 --> 00:55:18.800 align:start position:0%
the the topic of euthanasia comes to
 
00:55:21.750 --> 00:55:21.760 align:start position:0%
bear as well and the Netherlands is is
 
00:55:24.750 --> 00:55:24.760 align:start position:0%
doing it children of all ages babies can
 
00:55:26.910 --> 00:55:26.920 align:start position:0%
be considered candidates for youth in
 
00:55:29.270 --> 00:55:29.280 align:start position:0%
Asia and that's in many places in Europe
 
00:55:31.229 --> 00:55:31.239 align:start position:0%
and in
 
00:55:31.239 --> 00:55:33.910 align:start position:0%
and in
Canada

00:55:33.910 --> 00:55:33.920 align:start position:0%
Canada
 
00:55:38.629 --> 00:55:38.639 align:start position:0%
and and um and Canada leads the world in
 
00:55:40.470 --> 00:55:40.480 align:start position:0%
in organ donations and it's not
 
00:55:43.910 --> 00:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
surprising that they have uh been caught
 
00:55:45.950 --> 00:55:45.960 align:start position:0%
inappropriately offering euthanasia to
 
00:55:48.470 --> 00:55:48.480 align:start position:0%
patients and China is another example
 
00:55:52.270 --> 00:55:52.280 align:start position:0%
where where they have been accused of
 
00:55:52.280 --> 00:55:53.430 align:start position:0%
where where they have been accused of
selling

00:55:53.430 --> 00:55:53.440 align:start position:0%
selling
 
00:55:57.149 --> 00:55:57.159 align:start position:0%
the of selling their the the organs and
 
00:56:01.589 --> 00:56:01.599 align:start position:0%
the and the bodies of of of um of their
 
00:56:03.550 --> 00:56:03.560 align:start position:0%
political dissidents and so I think that
 
00:56:06.109 --> 00:56:06.119 align:start position:0%
the world is less safe and less secure
 
00:56:09.470 --> 00:56:09.480 align:start position:0%
by opening the Pandora's Box um all
 
00:56:12.669 --> 00:56:12.679 align:start position:0%
right and so I apologize uh I couldn't
 
00:56:15.069 --> 00:56:15.079 align:start position:0%
find any sitter for my apologize but
 
00:56:16.270 --> 00:56:16.280 align:start position:0%
that's pretty much what I had to say
 
00:56:17.669 --> 00:56:17.679 align:start position:0%
questions for this witness
 
00:56:19.229 --> 00:56:19.239 align:start position:0%
representative Perez thank you thanks
 
00:56:21.069 --> 00:56:21.079 align:start position:0%
for I'll make it brief what type of
 
00:56:23.709 --> 00:56:23.719 align:start position:0%
physician are you uh I'm I'm a internal
 
00:56:25.629 --> 00:56:25.639 align:start position:0%
medicine and I work as a hospitalist
 
00:56:27.430 --> 00:56:27.440 align:start position:0%
okay and one more question are you
 
00:56:30.990 --> 00:56:31.000 align:start position:0%
limited because of what we have done
 
00:56:33.870 --> 00:56:33.880 align:start position:0%
with opioids are you Limited in your
 
00:56:37.430 --> 00:56:37.440 align:start position:0%
practice of how much pain medication you
 
00:56:41.109 --> 00:56:41.119 align:start position:0%
are allowed to prescribe for your p uh
 
00:56:43.709 --> 00:56:43.719 align:start position:0%
many uh as a point of my practice I
 
00:56:45.950 --> 00:56:45.960 align:start position:0%
usually just prescribe uh one week of
 
00:56:48.109 --> 00:56:48.119 align:start position:0%
opioids in many states it's becoming
 
00:56:52.310 --> 00:56:52.320 align:start position:0%
more common for that to happen and uh uh
 
00:56:54.669 --> 00:56:54.679 align:start position:0%
for them to limit that and I think if
 
00:56:56.750 --> 00:56:56.760 align:start position:0%
there is a limitation on paliative
 
00:56:58.069 --> 00:56:58.079 align:start position:0%
paliative doctors they should probably
 
00:56:59.589 --> 00:56:59.599 align:start position:0%
be allowed to prescribe a longer period
 
00:57:02.550 --> 00:57:02.560 align:start position:0%
of time so follow up quick y so
 
00:57:05.629 --> 00:57:05.639 align:start position:0%
basically when we went after all the
 
00:57:08.390 --> 00:57:08.400 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical companies for op opioids
 
00:57:10.790 --> 00:57:10.800 align:start position:0%
perhaps we should have taken into
 
00:57:13.550 --> 00:57:13.560 align:start position:0%
consideration people with chronic pain
 
00:57:15.550 --> 00:57:15.560 align:start position:0%
terminal illnesses and that type of
 
00:57:18.430 --> 00:57:18.440 align:start position:0%
thing to be exempt from from that I
 
00:57:19.510 --> 00:57:19.520 align:start position:0%
think that would solve a lot of the
 
00:57:20.510 --> 00:57:20.520 align:start position:0%
problems and we wouldn't have the
 
00:57:22.830 --> 00:57:22.840 align:start position:0%
controversy thank you other questions
 
00:57:25.310 --> 00:57:25.320 align:start position:0%
for this witness seeing none thank you
 
00:57:27.629 --> 00:57:27.639 align:start position:0%
very much sorry about that folks no
 
00:57:29.950 --> 00:57:29.960 align:start position:0%
problem Dr John Edinger and then the
 
00:57:36.950 --> 00:57:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:36.960 --> 00:57:38.910 align:start position:0%

and no it's okay and you know before you
 
00:57:45.270 --> 00:57:45.280 align:start position:0%
begin doctor can I uh I know Mr Dunn is
 
00:57:47.030 --> 00:57:47.040 align:start position:0%
in the audience Mr Dunn is this the
 
00:57:48.910 --> 00:57:48.920 align:start position:0%
witness that you were talking thank you
 
00:57:51.270 --> 00:57:51.280 align:start position:0%
very much all right Dr please go ahead
 
00:57:53.310 --> 00:57:53.320 align:start position:0%
hi there I'm dealing with a little bit
 
00:57:54.669 --> 00:57:54.679 align:start position:0%
of a throat issue this morning so I
 
00:57:56.629 --> 00:57:56.639 align:start position:0%
apologize I'm a problem cardiologist
 
00:57:58.189 --> 00:57:58.199 align:start position:0%
Catholic Medical Center I'm here on
 
00:58:01.030 --> 00:58:01.040 align:start position:0%
behalf of myself um I also am president
 
00:58:03.109 --> 00:58:03.119 align:start position:0%
of the Board of Medicine and um I am in
 
00:58:04.709 --> 00:58:04.719 align:start position:0%
no way representing the board today I
 
00:58:06.109 --> 00:58:06.119 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure people are aware
 
00:58:08.390 --> 00:58:08.400 align:start position:0%
of that I'm simply here as a um
 
00:58:10.510 --> 00:58:10.520 align:start position:0%
concerned physician I'm in opposition to
 
00:58:12.629 --> 00:58:12.639 align:start position:0%
the bill I have a couple quick points I
 
00:58:14.149 --> 00:58:14.159 align:start position:0%
deal with a lot of patients who are at
 
00:58:15.750 --> 00:58:15.760 align:start position:0%
the end of life death and dying mostly
 
00:58:17.550 --> 00:58:17.560 align:start position:0%
through congestive heart failure I hate
 
00:58:20.709 --> 00:58:20.719 align:start position:0%
the the stories that have been um told
 
00:58:22.990 --> 00:58:23.000 align:start position:0%
today because it's just you know it's
 
00:58:25.229 --> 00:58:25.239 align:start position:0%
really not what we want as a medical
 
00:58:26.990 --> 00:58:27.000 align:start position:0%
society for people to die in pain and
 
00:58:29.390 --> 00:58:29.400 align:start position:0%
suffering we're both coming at this from
 
00:58:32.470 --> 00:58:32.480 align:start position:0%
both sides of the coin have that as a
 
00:58:35.430 --> 00:58:35.440 align:start position:0%
common as a have that as a common goal
 
00:58:37.069 --> 00:58:37.079 align:start position:0%
we don't want people to die with pain we
 
00:58:39.030 --> 00:58:39.040 align:start position:0%
don't want people to die with suffering
 
00:58:41.229 --> 00:58:41.239 align:start position:0%
and I think similar to the uh
 
00:58:43.750 --> 00:58:43.760 align:start position:0%
representative's Point going towards the
 
00:58:45.870 --> 00:58:45.880 align:start position:0%
representatives point I think um using
 
00:58:48.430 --> 00:58:48.440 align:start position:0%
the opiate epidemic as a uh as an
 
00:58:50.510 --> 00:58:50.520 align:start position:0%
example we could have done a much better
 
00:58:52.910 --> 00:58:52.920 align:start position:0%
job there in terms of how we prescribe
 
00:58:54.430 --> 00:58:54.440 align:start position:0%
we were part of that problem the
 
00:58:56.270 --> 00:58:56.280 align:start position:0%
prescribers themselves were part of that
 
00:58:59.709 --> 00:58:59.719 align:start position:0%
problem and in terms of palea of care we
 
00:59:01.470 --> 00:59:01.480 align:start position:0%
get very little training in medical
 
00:59:03.430 --> 00:59:03.440 align:start position:0%
school in terms of how to pale how to
 
00:59:05.830 --> 00:59:05.840 align:start position:0%
deal with dying I get a 99% of my
 
00:59:08.030 --> 00:59:08.040 align:start position:0%
training is how to how to cure disease
 
00:59:09.870 --> 00:59:09.880 align:start position:0%
how to help people how to get them
 
00:59:11.830 --> 00:59:11.840 align:start position:0%
better we get very little at the end of
 
00:59:15.069 --> 00:59:15.079 align:start position:0%
life so I see a bill like this and I say
 
00:59:16.750 --> 00:59:16.760 align:start position:0%
to myself wow we're just going to create
 
00:59:19.350 --> 00:59:19.360 align:start position:0%
an option where we're now going to um
 
00:59:20.990 --> 00:59:21.000 align:start position:0%
move people right towards the end of
 
00:59:22.229 --> 00:59:22.239 align:start position:0%
life very quickly we're not going to
 
00:59:24.149 --> 00:59:24.159 align:start position:0%
focus on pil of care at all what I'd
 
00:59:25.870 --> 00:59:25.880 align:start position:0%
like to see is the state Focus
 
00:59:27.910 --> 00:59:27.920 align:start position:0%
significantly more effort and more funds
 
00:59:30.310 --> 00:59:30.320 align:start position:0%
on palean on the end of life on dealing
 
00:59:32.390 --> 00:59:32.400 align:start position:0%
with death and dying in this manner as
 
00:59:34.069 --> 00:59:34.079 align:start position:0%
opposed to just prescribing a pill where
 
00:59:37.109 --> 00:59:37.119 align:start position:0%
I can off somebody this is suicide it's
 
00:59:39.629 --> 00:59:39.639 align:start position:0%
not it's just a it's the the terminology
 
00:59:41.030 --> 00:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
in the bill they can't even really begin
 
00:59:42.550 --> 00:59:42.560 align:start position:0%
to speak to it it's just you're
 
00:59:44.830 --> 00:59:44.840 align:start position:0%
prescribing a drug which will kill you
 
00:59:47.790 --> 00:59:47.800 align:start position:0%
I'm prescribing that drug um I see that
 
00:59:49.350 --> 00:59:49.360 align:start position:0%
as changing our culture I see that that
 
00:59:51.149 --> 00:59:51.159 align:start position:0%
is moving the needle and as another me
 
00:59:53.069 --> 00:59:53.079 align:start position:0%
as another speaker just mentioned you
 
00:59:54.589 --> 00:59:54.599 align:start position:0%
start to change the culture of the
 
00:59:56.229 --> 00:59:56.239 align:start position:0%
discussion you start to change the
 
00:59:58.069 --> 00:59:58.079 align:start position:0%
discussion you start to change society's
 
00:59:59.709 --> 00:59:59.719 align:start position:0%
opinion as to what it's acceptable you
 
01:00:01.390 --> 01:00:01.400 align:start position:0%
start moving into marginalized
 
01:00:02.950 --> 01:00:02.960 align:start position:0%
populations and telling them it's more
 
01:00:05.189 --> 01:00:05.199 align:start position:0%
acceptable for them to off themselves
 
01:00:07.430 --> 01:00:07.440 align:start position:0%
you start to move towards more suicides
 
01:00:09.310 --> 01:00:09.320 align:start position:0%
in society we have very little empiric
 
01:00:11.510 --> 01:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
data on this but the data we have shows
 
01:00:13.750 --> 01:00:13.760 align:start position:0%
that in states that have allowed Medical
 
01:00:15.470 --> 01:00:15.480 align:start position:0%
Aid and dying we see the needle tick
 
01:00:17.550 --> 01:00:17.560 align:start position:0%
towards more suicide I want to avoid
 
01:00:19.669 --> 01:00:19.679 align:start position:0%
that it's very difficult to safe
 
01:00:22.189 --> 01:00:22.199 align:start position:0%
this process the intent is there but I'm
 
01:00:23.350 --> 01:00:23.360 align:start position:0%
very good at knowing when somebody's
 
01:00:25.109 --> 01:00:25.119 align:start position:0%
going to die within a week if somebody's
 
01:00:26.950 --> 01:00:26.960 align:start position:0%
going to die within 6 months very very
 
01:00:28.950 --> 01:00:28.960 align:start position:0%
challenging to know that okay somebody
 
01:00:30.470 --> 01:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
else gave an example about 10 years with
 
01:00:31.990 --> 01:00:32.000 align:start position:0%
a terminal diagnosis I don't want to
 
01:00:33.669 --> 01:00:33.679 align:start position:0%
make you a statistic I want to look at
 
01:00:35.030 --> 01:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
you as an individual and give you the
 
01:00:37.470 --> 01:00:37.480 align:start position:0%
care that you deserve but just calling
 
01:00:39.149 --> 01:00:39.159 align:start position:0%
it six months and saying that's a sa
 
01:00:41.750 --> 01:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
Safeguard it's very soft um it puts a
 
01:00:44.270 --> 01:00:44.280 align:start position:0%
lot of burdens on the patient well you
 
01:00:47.350 --> 01:00:47.360 align:start position:0%
know I could save $10,000 and if if I
 
01:00:48.750 --> 01:00:48.760 align:start position:0%
take the pill my family doesn't go
 
01:00:49.830 --> 01:00:49.840 align:start position:0%
through this burden but then your
 
01:00:51.510 --> 01:00:51.520 align:start position:0%
family's left with the burden afterwards
 
01:00:54.750 --> 01:00:54.760 align:start position:0%
did I make the right decision um doctor
 
01:00:56.669 --> 01:00:56.679 align:start position:0%
you're uh you're kind of over your time
 
01:01:00.149 --> 01:01:00.159 align:start position:0%
all I appreciate it so um I think we
 
01:01:01.990 --> 01:01:02.000 align:start position:0%
start we have to start talking about
 
01:01:05.310 --> 01:01:05.320 align:start position:0%
dying and not the cult not death I think
 
01:01:07.750 --> 01:01:07.760 align:start position:0%
we need to do a better job with um being
 
01:01:09.589 --> 01:01:09.599 align:start position:0%
compassionate supportive caring at the
 
01:01:10.990 --> 01:01:11.000 align:start position:0%
end of life it doesn't come through a
 
01:01:12.629 --> 01:01:12.639 align:start position:0%
pill it comes through caring I think we
 
01:01:13.950 --> 01:01:13.960 align:start position:0%
can fund that better I think we can
 
01:01:16.149 --> 01:01:16.159 align:start position:0%
train Physicians better um I'd like to
 
01:01:19.149 --> 01:01:19.159 align:start position:0%
see legislative efforts towards that and
 
01:01:21.390 --> 01:01:21.400 align:start position:0%
finally every day I have to battle
 
01:01:23.310 --> 01:01:23.320 align:start position:0%
insurance companies on what I think is
 
01:01:25.950 --> 01:01:25.960 align:start position:0%
the most effective um therapy it comes
 
01:01:28.189 --> 01:01:28.199 align:start position:0%
down to cost in their mind we are all a
 
01:01:30.109 --> 01:01:30.119 align:start position:0%
cost when it comes to insurance and a
 
01:01:32.229 --> 01:01:32.239 align:start position:0%
payment model I don't want that to be an
 
01:01:33.669 --> 01:01:33.679 align:start position:0%
option at the end of life for people I
 
01:01:35.069 --> 01:01:35.079 align:start position:0%
want to be able to choose the best
 
01:01:35.990 --> 01:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
option for them I don't want an
 
01:01:37.830 --> 01:01:37.840 align:start position:0%
insurance company saying to me you know
 
01:01:40.310 --> 01:01:40.320 align:start position:0%
what the pill's a great option and have
 
01:01:41.990 --> 01:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
to question their incentives at the end
 
01:01:44.550 --> 01:01:44.560 align:start position:0%
of life thank you very much thank you
 
01:01:47.030 --> 01:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
questions for representative Perez thank
 
01:01:49.030 --> 01:01:49.040 align:start position:0%
you thanks I actually managed your off
 
01:01:50.950 --> 01:01:50.960 align:start position:0%
office 20 years ago oh I'm sorry it's
 
01:01:53.910 --> 01:01:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:57.189 --> 01:01:57.199 align:start position:0%
mess um my concern with this and you
 
01:02:00.189 --> 01:02:00.199 align:start position:0%
mentioned um uh congestive heart failure
 
01:02:02.910 --> 01:02:02.920 align:start position:0%
sure um my concern with this is that
 
01:02:05.310 --> 01:02:05.320 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of things left out of
 
01:02:06.950 --> 01:02:06.960 align:start position:0%
this bill one of them being liver
 
01:02:09.750 --> 01:02:09.760 align:start position:0%
disease that's not a terminal illness
 
01:02:11.510 --> 01:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
it's a death sentence but it's not a
 
01:02:15.669 --> 01:02:15.679 align:start position:0%
terminal illness um people who have um
 
01:02:19.390 --> 01:02:19.400 align:start position:0%
um chronic pain with um an injury
 
01:02:22.790 --> 01:02:22.800 align:start position:0%
perhaps um degenerative St injuries um
 
01:02:24.870 --> 01:02:24.880 align:start position:0%
by accident kidney disease multiple
 
01:02:28.510 --> 01:02:28.520 align:start position:0%
sclerosis spinal diseases none of these
 
01:02:30.870 --> 01:02:30.880 align:start position:0%
are covered by this because this is
 
01:02:32.750 --> 01:02:32.760 align:start position:0%
saying terminal
 
01:02:36.069 --> 01:02:36.079 align:start position:0%
illness what's to say that we pass this
 
01:02:38.750 --> 01:02:38.760 align:start position:0%
and we do like Canada did and have a
 
01:02:41.910 --> 01:02:41.920 align:start position:0%
timeline and keep including all of these
 
01:02:45.430 --> 01:02:45.440 align:start position:0%
things um do you see that as a problem
 
01:02:46.830 --> 01:02:46.840 align:start position:0%
where none of these other things are
 
01:02:48.990 --> 01:02:49.000 align:start position:0%
covered yeah I absolutely do see it as
 
01:02:51.229 --> 01:02:51.239 align:start position:0%
is a problem the last attempt at at a
 
01:02:53.990 --> 01:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
bill of this sort and um I think it was
 
01:02:56.310 --> 01:02:56.320 align:start position:0%
maybe two years ago now um even within
 
01:02:57.830 --> 01:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
the committee discussions we started to
 
01:02:59.990 --> 01:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
see this being added on as a possibility
 
01:03:01.589 --> 01:03:01.599 align:start position:0%
where neurodegenerative diseases were
 
01:03:03.750 --> 01:03:03.760 align:start position:0%
going to be added it's a it's the
 
01:03:06.350 --> 01:03:06.360 align:start position:0%
natural um point of discussion to keep
 
01:03:09.109 --> 01:03:09.119 align:start position:0%
moving towards this as somebody has a
 
01:03:11.270 --> 01:03:11.280 align:start position:0%
diagnosis which might be a terminal
 
01:03:13.709 --> 01:03:13.719 align:start position:0%
illness but it might not be within six
 
01:03:15.790 --> 01:03:15.800 align:start position:0%
months so it's going to be the natural
 
01:03:17.470 --> 01:03:17.480 align:start position:0%
sort of progression of this I think
 
01:03:19.629 --> 01:03:19.639 align:start position:0%
Canada is a great example in fact in
 
01:03:22.510 --> 01:03:22.520 align:start position:0%
Canada right now next month when this is
 
01:03:24.030 --> 01:03:24.040 align:start position:0%
enacted you don't have to have any
 
01:03:25.310 --> 01:03:25.320 align:start position:0%
treatments you can be offered the
 
01:03:26.950 --> 01:03:26.960 align:start position:0%
treatment I can be offered by any
 
01:03:28.510 --> 01:03:28.520 align:start position:0%
depressive I can be offered my
 
01:03:30.870 --> 01:03:30.880 align:start position:0%
counseling I can be offered ECT but I
 
01:03:32.950 --> 01:03:32.960 align:start position:0%
don't have to take it I can just take
 
01:03:35.109 --> 01:03:35.119 align:start position:0%
the pill and it gets us very slippery
 
01:03:37.550 --> 01:03:37.560 align:start position:0%
slope thank you other questions for this
 
01:03:39.870 --> 01:03:39.880 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you very much
 
01:03:42.830 --> 01:03:42.840 align:start position:0%
thank you all right um Ed

01:04:29.470 --> 01:04:29.480 align:start position:0%
last word of our organization options
 
01:04:31.069 --> 01:04:31.079 align:start position:0%
the bill before you provides an
 
01:04:33.430 --> 01:04:33.440 align:start position:0%
important choice and additional option
 
01:04:36.589 --> 01:04:36.599 align:start position:0%
for end of life care it's good to see
 
01:04:39.790 --> 01:04:39.800 align:start position:0%
some familiar faces and friends and good
 
01:04:42.629 --> 01:04:42.639 align:start position:0%
to meet those of you that I have not met
 
01:04:45.629 --> 01:04:45.639 align:start position:0%
yet um I was a state rep for six terms
 
01:04:46.990 --> 01:04:47.000 align:start position:0%
and I was the chair of the Commerce
 
01:04:48.950 --> 01:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
Committee when the Democrats were in the
 
01:04:51.149 --> 01:04:51.159 align:start position:0%
majority I've lived in New Hampshire for
 
01:04:54.229 --> 01:04:54.239 align:start position:0%
30 years and I'm an inkeeper in Crawford
 
01:04:56.470 --> 01:04:56.480 align:start position:0%
notch in Hearts location the smallest
 
01:04:59.030 --> 01:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
town before moving to New Hampshire I
 
01:05:00.750 --> 01:05:00.760 align:start position:0%
worked as a nurse in New York City in
 
01:05:03.470 --> 01:05:03.480 align:start position:0%
several practice areas and ultimately
 
01:05:05.350 --> 01:05:05.360 align:start position:0%
became a nursing home administrator and
 
01:05:07.470 --> 01:05:07.480 align:start position:0%
was the director of the first long-term
 
01:05:09.910 --> 01:05:09.920 align:start position:0%
care program for people with AIDS at the
 
01:05:12.270 --> 01:05:12.280 align:start position:0%
height of that epidemic throughout my
 
01:05:14.790 --> 01:05:14.800 align:start position:0%
career in healthcare I saw the ravages
 
01:05:17.109 --> 01:05:17.119 align:start position:0%
the disease and illness can bring and
 
01:05:19.709 --> 01:05:19.719 align:start position:0%
what seemed to me that unnecessary
 
01:05:22.870 --> 01:05:22.880 align:start position:0%
suffering for some at the end of their
 
01:05:25.589 --> 01:05:25.599 align:start position:0%
lives as you likely know Medical Aid and
 
01:05:29.030 --> 01:05:29.040 align:start position:0%
dying is the law in 10 states and in DC
 
01:05:31.189 --> 01:05:31.199 align:start position:0%
the First Medical Aid and dying bill
 
01:05:34.990 --> 01:05:35.000 align:start position:0%
made Bill uh passed in Oregon 24 years
 
01:05:37.589 --> 01:05:37.599 align:start position:0%
ago and it has a proven and positive
 
01:05:40.030 --> 01:05:40.040 align:start position:0%
track record in all jurisdictions where
 
01:05:43.030 --> 01:05:43.040 align:start position:0%
it is under Force our organization has
 
01:05:45.149 --> 01:05:45.159 align:start position:0%
worked diligently to learn about and
 
01:05:47.189 --> 01:05:47.199 align:start position:0%
understand how the laws in those states
 
01:05:49.589 --> 01:05:49.599 align:start position:0%
have functioned and we we have helped to
 
01:05:51.390 --> 01:05:51.400 align:start position:0%
craft and they have helped to craft the
 
01:05:53.790 --> 01:05:53.800 align:start position:0%
bill before you not only did we reach
 
01:05:57.430 --> 01:05:57.440 align:start position:0%
out to uh legislators and other states
 
01:05:59.229 --> 01:05:59.239 align:start position:0%
where this law is enforced but we talked
 
01:06:01.709 --> 01:06:01.719 align:start position:0%
with and consulted local St stakeholders
 
01:06:04.549 --> 01:06:04.559 align:start position:0%
as well as eth ethicists healthc Care
 
01:06:06.790 --> 01:06:06.800 align:start position:0%
Professionals and legal experts across
 
01:06:10.189 --> 01:06:10.199 align:start position:0%
the country though this legislature is
 
01:06:12.069 --> 01:06:12.079 align:start position:0%
has considered other bills regarding Aid
 
01:06:13.709 --> 01:06:13.719 align:start position:0%
and dying as you heard from
 
01:06:15.830 --> 01:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
representative Smith this is the first
 
01:06:17.709 --> 01:06:17.719 align:start position:0%
one presented in such a comprehensive
 
01:06:20.350 --> 01:06:20.360 align:start position:0%
Manner and with years of Grassroots work
 
01:06:23.390 --> 01:06:23.400 align:start position:0%
learning from citizens around the state
 
01:06:25.350 --> 01:06:25.360 align:start position:0%
as with all the other existing laws this
 
01:06:27.350 --> 01:06:27.360 align:start position:0%
bill requires the person requesting made
 
01:06:28.950 --> 01:06:28.960 align:start position:0%
to be in hospice care or to be
 
01:06:31.350 --> 01:06:31.360 align:start position:0%
determined within six months of their
 
01:06:33.470 --> 01:06:33.480 align:start position:0%
death they must be determined to be of
 
01:06:35.790 --> 01:06:35.800 align:start position:0%
sound mind and be able independently to
 
01:06:37.910 --> 01:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
take the prescribed medications
 
01:06:39.950 --> 01:06:39.960 align:start position:0%
safeguards are in place throughout this
 
01:06:42.430 --> 01:06:42.440 align:start position:0%
end of life care and the first healthc
 
01:06:44.589 --> 01:06:44.599 align:start position:0%
care provider must determine eligibility
 
01:06:46.430 --> 01:06:46.440 align:start position:0%
and then a second Consulting
 
01:06:48.750 --> 01:06:48.760 align:start position:0%
professional must concur the person
 
01:06:50.589 --> 01:06:50.599 align:start position:0%
requesting made must sign a form
 
01:06:52.629 --> 01:06:52.639 align:start position:0%
acknowledging that this is their choice
 
01:06:54.589 --> 01:06:54.599 align:start position:0%
and they understand the consequences of
 
01:06:57.790 --> 01:06:57.800 align:start position:0%
this request and two witnesses must sign
 
01:07:00.470 --> 01:07:00.480 align:start position:0%
in support the requests for made can be
 
01:07:02.310 --> 01:07:02.320 align:start position:0%
rescinded by the patient at any time and
 
01:07:03.950 --> 01:07:03.960 align:start position:0%
of course the patient doesn't have to
 
01:07:05.430 --> 01:07:05.440 align:start position:0%
take the
 
01:07:07.990 --> 01:07:08.000 align:start position:0%
medication one story that illustrates
 
01:07:09.790 --> 01:07:09.800 align:start position:0%
why this bill is so needed is about a
 
01:07:12.229 --> 01:07:12.239 align:start position:0%
wonderful neighbor that we had a very
 
01:07:14.870 --> 01:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
independent woman in her 80s who loved
 
01:07:16.950 --> 01:07:16.960 align:start position:0%
the mountains and loved to work on
 
01:07:19.030 --> 01:07:19.040 align:start position:0%
clearing and maintaining Trails
 
01:07:22.030 --> 01:07:22.040 align:start position:0%
throughout the mountains near her home
 
01:07:23.910 --> 01:07:23.920 align:start position:0%
she had a hip replacement and then a
 
01:07:25.470 --> 01:07:25.480 align:start position:0%
second surgery because the first one
 
01:07:28.069 --> 01:07:28.079 align:start position:0%
wasn't successful even after the second
 
01:07:30.350 --> 01:07:30.360 align:start position:0%
surgery she wasn't able to take care I
 
01:07:31.430 --> 01:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
don't mean to interrupt you but you
 
01:07:33.270 --> 01:07:33.280 align:start position:0%
really are you're going over your time
 
01:07:35.629 --> 01:07:35.639 align:start position:0%
she wasn't able take care of herself she
 
01:07:38.589 --> 01:07:38.599 align:start position:0%
deteriorated rapidly she asked her M MD
 
01:07:40.910 --> 01:07:40.920 align:start position:0%
for medications to help her end her life
 
01:07:43.430 --> 01:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
but of course the doctor couldn't imply
 
01:07:45.069 --> 01:07:45.079 align:start position:0%
then one day we received a note which
 
01:07:47.510 --> 01:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
read by the time you read this I will be
 
01:07:50.149 --> 01:07:50.159 align:start position:0%
dead Beth had taken her own life because
 
01:07:51.830 --> 01:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
the state did not offer a more
 
01:07:54.510 --> 01:07:54.520 align:start position:0%
compassionate and peaceful way to die
 
01:07:56.390 --> 01:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
this is only one example of why the bill
 
01:07:58.669 --> 01:07:58.679 align:start position:0%
before you is critically important I
 
01:08:00.709 --> 01:08:00.719 align:start position:0%
look forward to your deliberations and
 
01:08:02.910 --> 01:08:02.920 align:start position:0%

Stacy

01:08:26.430 --> 01:08:26.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:28.270 --> 01:08:28.280 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you for allowing me
 
01:08:30.510 --> 01:08:30.520 align:start position:0%
to testify my name is Dr step Misha I'm
 
01:08:31.669 --> 01:08:31.679 align:start position:0%
a family
 
01:08:33.830 --> 01:08:33.840 align:start position:0%
practitioner I work in gtown New
 
01:08:35.750 --> 01:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire native New Hampshire that's
 
01:08:37.430 --> 01:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
where I grew up so I have the pr
 
01:08:39.709 --> 01:08:39.719 align:start position:0%
privilege of serving the town that I
 
01:08:42.069 --> 01:08:42.079 align:start position:0%
grew up with kind of a Marcus Welby type
 
01:08:42.079 --> 01:08:43.709 align:start position:0%
grew up with kind of a Marcus Welby type
situation

01:08:43.709 --> 01:08:43.719 align:start position:0%
situation
 
01:08:46.669 --> 01:08:46.679 align:start position:0%
so so I'd like to
 
01:08:50.069 --> 01:08:50.079 align:start position:0%
one I'm concerned about have I I I truly
 
01:08:52.189 --> 01:08:52.199 align:start position:0%
love New Hampshire and my choice would
 
01:08:55.629 --> 01:08:55.639 align:start position:0%
be not to follow the path that our
 
01:08:57.350 --> 01:08:57.360 align:start position:0%
neighboring states have followed I am
 
01:08:59.750 --> 01:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
concerned I didn't see a residency
 
01:09:02.549 --> 01:09:02.559 align:start position:0%
status in this bill which is concerning
 
01:09:05.189 --> 01:09:05.199 align:start position:0%
to me uh one of the things that happened
 
01:09:09.030 --> 01:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
in Oregon is that was
 
01:09:12.109 --> 01:09:12.119 align:start position:0%
totally looked the other way and decided
 
01:09:13.669 --> 01:09:13.679 align:start position:0%
that you didn't have the the original
 
01:09:16.549 --> 01:09:16.559 align:start position:0%
Bill had a residency status and now
 
01:09:18.950 --> 01:09:18.960 align:start position:0%
that's no longer the case
 
01:09:22.830 --> 01:09:22.840 align:start position:0%
I'd also like to uh quote some myths
 
01:09:25.189 --> 01:09:25.199 align:start position:0%
this is a book called to die well which
 
01:09:27.669 --> 01:09:27.679 align:start position:0%
we all hope to do written by a
 
01:09:30.510 --> 01:09:30.520 align:start position:0%
neurosurgeon and he quoted some specific
 
01:09:32.430 --> 01:09:32.440 align:start position:0%
myths regarding physician assisted
 
01:09:35.270 --> 01:09:35.280 align:start position:0%
suicide number one physician assisted
 
01:09:37.430 --> 01:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
suicide is universally successful
 
01:09:42.750 --> 01:09:42.760 align:start position:0%
painless and peaceful so these myths are
 
01:09:44.910 --> 01:09:44.920 align:start position:0%
related to published medical literature
 
01:09:47.189 --> 01:09:47.199 align:start position:0%
so for instance doing the Journal of
 
01:09:48.870 --> 01:09:48.880 align:start position:0%
Medicine uh
 
01:09:50.709 --> 01:09:50.719 align:start position:0%
Journal American Medical Association
 
01:09:52.229 --> 01:09:52.239 align:start position:0%
British medical journal so this isn't
 
01:09:54.430 --> 01:09:54.440 align:start position:0%
just myths that are taken out of the air
 
01:09:55.669 --> 01:09:55.679 align:start position:0%
I would say the New England Journal of
 
01:09:58.430 --> 01:09:58.440 align:start position:0%
Medicine is on the wrong side of the
 
01:10:02.430 --> 01:10:02.440 align:start position:0%
coin but regardless it's a a a a fairly
 
01:10:05.390 --> 01:10:05.400 align:start position:0%
renowned Journal so physician of suicide
 
01:10:07.030 --> 01:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
is universally stressful painless and
 
01:10:08.830 --> 01:10:08.840 align:start position:0%
peaceful significant side effects in
 
01:10:10.790 --> 01:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
many patients occur requiring a
 
01:10:12.990 --> 01:10:13.000 align:start position:0%
physician to then administer a lethal
 
01:10:15.470 --> 01:10:15.480 align:start position:0%
dose of the medication that's been
 
01:10:17.870 --> 01:10:17.880 align:start position:0%
determined myth number two patients who
 
01:10:20.990 --> 01:10:21.000 align:start position:0%
die by physician assisted suicide are
 
01:10:23.430 --> 01:10:23.440 align:start position:0%
properly screened to rule out any and
 
01:10:25.830 --> 01:10:25.840 align:start position:0%
treat psychiatric illness in the British
 
01:10:28.629 --> 01:10:28.639 align:start position:0%
Med medical journal a study one out of
 
01:10:30.709 --> 01:10:30.719 align:start position:0%
three patients in Oregon met criteria
 
01:10:32.589 --> 01:10:32.599 align:start position:0%
for clinical depression and should have
 
01:10:35.830 --> 01:10:35.840 align:start position:0%
been excluded myth number three adequate
 
01:10:37.790 --> 01:10:37.800 align:start position:0%
oversight exists to prevent assisted
 
01:10:40.229 --> 01:10:40.239 align:start position:0%
suicide abuses this is a letter to the
 
01:10:41.910 --> 01:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
Journal of the American Medical
 
01:10:44.310 --> 01:10:44.320 align:start position:0%

patient myth number four and this is the
 
01:10:53.709 --> 01:10:53.719 align:start position:0%
one big concern and it's addressed by
 
01:10:55.669 --> 01:10:55.679 align:start position:0%

patients Netherlands Canada since 2002
 
01:11:01.950 --> 01:11:01.960 align:start position:0%
have seen this not to be the case and
 
01:11:04.390 --> 01:11:04.400 align:start position:0%
the definition of unbearable suffering
 
01:11:06.709 --> 01:11:06.719 align:start position:0%
has been Braden leading to physician
 
01:11:08.750 --> 01:11:08.760 align:start position:0%
assisted suicide in many patients with
 
01:11:11.390 --> 01:11:11.400 align:start position:0%
terminal disease I'd like to read just a
 
01:11:13.390 --> 01:11:13.400 align:start position:0%
small short paragraph in this book again
 
01:11:15.229 --> 01:11:15.239 align:start position:0%
written by a neurosur over your you're
 
01:11:16.870 --> 01:11:16.880 align:start position:0%
over your time doctor I'm sorry one
 
01:11:18.990 --> 01:11:19.000 align:start position:0%
paragraph the truth of physician
 
01:11:20.549 --> 01:11:20.559 align:start position:0%
assisted suicide is far from the
 
01:11:22.310 --> 01:11:22.320 align:start position:0%

compliance with established safeguards
 
01:11:29.870 --> 01:11:29.880 align:start position:0%
history has shown that physician
 
01:11:33.030 --> 01:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
assisted suicide is problematic at
 
01:11:35.270 --> 01:11:35.280 align:start position:0%
multiple levels all right questions for
 
01:11:38.109 --> 01:11:38.119 align:start position:0%
this witness representative Perez thank
 
01:11:40.709 --> 01:11:40.719 align:start position:0%
you thanks for taking my question um
 
01:11:42.229 --> 01:11:42.239 align:start position:0%
what do you think would happen under our
 
01:11:44.910 --> 01:11:44.920 align:start position:0%
current statue when a physician over
 
01:11:46.910 --> 01:11:46.920 align:start position:0%
prescribes a medication and it is used
 
01:11:49.270 --> 01:11:49.280 align:start position:0%
by patients with to commit suicide I
 
01:11:50.750 --> 01:11:50.760 align:start position:0%
mean we have
 
01:11:53.750 --> 01:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
a statute that says you can't do this
 
01:11:55.589 --> 01:11:55.599 align:start position:0%
but yet we're trying to ask you to do
 
01:11:58.350 --> 01:11:58.360 align:start position:0%
this so I'm not aware of the statute but
 
01:12:00.030 --> 01:12:00.040 align:start position:0%
I do know that the administration of
 
01:12:02.470 --> 01:12:02.480 align:start position:0%
endo life pain medications is not driven
 
01:12:05.910 --> 01:12:05.920 align:start position:0%
to commit suicide is to treat symptoms
 
01:12:08.750 --> 01:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
and so if you use it in that respect I
 
01:12:10.589 --> 01:12:10.599 align:start position:0%
don't see where that would be a problem
 
01:12:12.310 --> 01:12:12.320 align:start position:0%
maybe you have other information but
 
01:12:15.149 --> 01:12:15.159 align:start position:0%
these meds can be used to treat symptoms
 
01:12:18.109 --> 01:12:18.119 align:start position:0%
and if the side if if the end result
 
01:12:21.709 --> 01:12:21.719 align:start position:0%
adult is death that that's not a problem
 
01:12:25.310 --> 01:12:25.320 align:start position:0%
by any by follow quick I'm saying that
 
01:12:27.629 --> 01:12:27.639 align:start position:0%
we're asking
 
01:12:31.589 --> 01:12:31.599 align:start position:0%
Physicians who are bound by law not to
 
01:12:34.709 --> 01:12:34.719 align:start position:0%
overprescribe medications first for and
 
01:12:38.149 --> 01:12:38.159 align:start position:0%
we're asking a physician to give a
 
01:12:41.790 --> 01:12:41.800 align:start position:0%
cocktail that will kill someone what
 
01:12:43.669 --> 01:12:43.679 align:start position:0%
what's the question my question is do
 
01:12:46.589 --> 01:12:46.599 align:start position:0%
you see that as a problem for
 
01:12:48.870 --> 01:12:48.880 align:start position:0%
positions I guess if if they're bound
 
01:12:50.950 --> 01:12:50.960 align:start position:0%
not to overprescribe then that is a
 
01:12:53.549 --> 01:12:53.559 align:start position:0%
problem but based on Integrity I don't
 
01:12:55.069 --> 01:12:55.079 align:start position:0%
there is some Integrity in the whole
 
01:12:56.950 --> 01:12:56.960 align:start position:0%
thing and I think that makes a
 
01:12:59.149 --> 01:12:59.159 align:start position:0%
difference okay other questions for this
 
01:13:01.350 --> 01:13:01.360 align:start position:0%

legislation if passed hb1 1283 would

suffering becomes
 
01:13:54.149 --> 01:13:54.159 align:start position:0%
unbearable this bill includes strict

their mind about utilizing the option at

any time during a multi-step process
 
01:14:08.390 --> 01:14:08.400 align:start position:0%
participation is voluntary for patients
 
01:14:11.229 --> 01:14:11.239 align:start position:0%

that individuals are not eligible for

subsequently published statistical

moment they obtain the prescription ion

terminally ill people peace of mind to
 
01:15:19.589 --> 01:15:19.599 align:start position:0%
not worry about whether or not they are

going to die a horrible death and
 
01:15:23.750 --> 01:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
instead focus on the present and the

time they have left terminally ill
 
01:15:27.790 --> 01:15:27.800 align:start position:0%

respectfully register our opposition to
 
01:16:19.510 --> 01:16:19.520 align:start position:0%
house Bill
 
01:16:23.990 --> 01:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
1283 assisted suicide invariably is
 
01:16:26.669 --> 01:16:26.679 align:start position:0%
presented as an issue of individual
 
01:16:30.109 --> 01:16:30.119 align:start position:0%
autonomy but we want to respectfully ask
 
01:16:33.190 --> 01:16:33.200 align:start position:0%
you to look at this bill against the
 
01:16:36.669 --> 01:16:36.679 align:start position:0%
backdrop of the principle that part one
 
01:16:38.270 --> 01:16:38.280 align:start position:0%
article one of the New Hampshire
 
01:16:40.870 --> 01:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
Constitution says is one of the
 
01:16:44.070 --> 01:16:44.080 align:start position:0%
foundation stones of our body politic
 
01:16:46.669 --> 01:16:46.679 align:start position:0%
and that is the principle of the common
 
01:16:50.309 --> 01:16:50.319 align:start position:0%
good and despite the good intentions of
 
01:16:53.230 --> 01:16:53.240 align:start position:0%
the bill sponsors we think that the
 
01:16:57.030 --> 01:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
remarkable diversity of the Coalition
 
01:16:59.190 --> 01:16:59.200 align:start position:0%
that has come together to oppose this
 
01:17:02.030 --> 01:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
bill speaks to the breadth of the
 
01:17:05.469 --> 01:17:05.479 align:start position:0%
dangers that an assisted suicide law
 
01:17:07.549 --> 01:17:07.559 align:start position:0%
would pose not just to the people who
 
01:17:09.830 --> 01:17:09.840 align:start position:0%
choose to end their own lives under the
 
01:17:13.629 --> 01:17:13.639 align:start position:0%
bill but also to the many other people
 
01:17:15.990 --> 01:17:16.000 align:start position:0%
whose lives will be placed at risk or
 
01:17:18.549 --> 01:17:18.559 align:start position:0%
will be compromised in some way if a
 
01:17:21.389 --> 01:17:21.399 align:start position:0%
bill like this is passed if we dip our
 
01:17:27.150 --> 01:17:27.160 align:start position:0%
toes in this water and so I hope that uh
 
01:17:30.469 --> 01:17:30.479 align:start position:0%
this committee will heed all of the
 
01:17:32.910 --> 01:17:32.920 align:start position:0%
flashing red warning lights that are

01:18:25.110 --> 01:18:25.120 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor on this bill I support it for
 
01:18:28.750 --> 01:18:28.760 align:start position:0%
me it's a liberty issue um it's clear
 
01:18:31.150 --> 01:18:31.160 align:start position:0%
that body autonomy and medical Freedom
 
01:18:33.190 --> 01:18:33.200 align:start position:0%
are very important to Granite Staters as
 
01:18:37.349 --> 01:18:37.359 align:start position:0%
they are to me um we need to give people
 
01:18:40.549 --> 01:18:40.559 align:start position:0%
options and we should not becoming in
 
01:18:43.270 --> 01:18:43.280 align:start position:0%
between a dying patient and their right
 
01:18:44.990 --> 01:18:45.000 align:start position:0%
to a medication they
 
01:18:47.509 --> 01:18:47.519 align:start position:0%
choose this bill has several safeguards
 
01:18:49.270 --> 01:18:49.280 align:start position:0%
cards I feel like there's a lot of um
 
01:18:51.230 --> 01:18:51.240 align:start position:0%
fear surrounding this bill but if you
 
01:18:52.790 --> 01:18:52.800 align:start position:0%
read the bill I think it's very well
 
01:18:55.150 --> 01:18:55.160 align:start position:0%
written there is nothing in the bill to
 
01:18:57.750 --> 01:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
require a physician or a pharmacist to
 
01:19:00.509 --> 01:19:00.519 align:start position:0%
participate if they choose not to um
 
01:19:03.830 --> 01:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
this is a self- administered procedure
 
01:19:06.669 --> 01:19:06.679 align:start position:0%
so I think all of the uh safeguards like
 
01:19:08.509 --> 01:19:08.519 align:start position:0%
I said were are well written and I'm
 
01:19:09.790 --> 01:19:09.800 align:start position:0%
happy to take questions but I just want
 
01:19:11.709 --> 01:19:11.719 align:start position:0%
to say from a liberty perspective I've
 
01:19:13.830 --> 01:19:13.840 align:start position:0%
been trying to talk to a lot of people
 
01:19:17.549 --> 01:19:17.559 align:start position:0%
who um are misled or or or fear-based
 
01:19:19.150 --> 01:19:19.160 align:start position:0%
response to this bill on what it might
 
01:19:20.870 --> 01:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
become and I want us to look at the bill
 
01:19:21.990 --> 01:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
as written
 
01:19:24.830 --> 01:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
today um the slippery slope concept of
 
01:19:26.709 --> 01:19:26.719 align:start position:0%
what this bill may become would bring it
 
01:19:28.750 --> 01:19:28.760 align:start position:0%
right back to this room again for a
 
01:19:30.589 --> 01:19:30.599 align:start position:0%
legislative process so we can stop it
 
01:19:32.709 --> 01:19:32.719 align:start position:0%
from becoming something else that it is
 
01:19:35.030 --> 01:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
not today so please support this Bill
 
01:19:38.230 --> 01:19:38.240 align:start position:0%

been integrally involved in delivering
 
01:20:11.429 --> 01:20:11.439 align:start position:0%
end of life care to countless patients
 
01:20:14.990 --> 01:20:15.000 align:start position:0%
over my career um I'm here to share my
 
01:20:18.469 --> 01:20:18.479 align:start position:0%
personal experience with the maid law in
 
01:20:21.469 --> 01:20:21.479 align:start position:0%
uh Vermont and help uh people understand
 
01:20:24.910 --> 01:20:24.920 align:start position:0%
how I came to support that process um uh
 
01:20:26.349 --> 01:20:26.359 align:start position:0%
several years ago I had a Vermont
 
01:20:28.429 --> 01:20:28.439 align:start position:0%
patient come back to me with uh telling
 
01:20:30.469 --> 01:20:30.479 align:start position:0%
me that he had metastatic uh colon
 
01:20:32.870 --> 01:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
cancer and he wanted me to help him uh
 
01:20:35.309 --> 01:20:35.319 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it became clear that his
 
01:20:38.750 --> 01:20:38.760 align:start position:0%
uh uh his disease was was quite Advanced
 
01:20:41.790 --> 01:20:41.800 align:start position:0%
and he had uh really a very poor
 
01:20:44.150 --> 01:20:44.160 align:start position:0%
prognosis so I started doing home visits
 
01:20:46.670 --> 01:20:46.680 align:start position:0%
because he became debilitated and uh at
 
01:20:49.590 --> 01:20:49.600 align:start position:0%
one point I was sitting in his uh living
 
01:20:51.070 --> 01:20:51.080 align:start position:0%
room and I looked over and I saw his gun
 
01:20:54.070 --> 01:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
cabinet uh off to the side and having
 
01:20:57.110 --> 01:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
had three uh elderly patients uh all of
 
01:20:59.429 --> 01:20:59.439 align:start position:0%
them men who had committed suicide with
 
01:21:01.910 --> 01:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
guns uh all of them with serious medical
 
01:21:05.110 --> 01:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
problems I very bluntly asked my patient
 
01:21:06.870 --> 01:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
if he had thought about hurting himself
 
01:21:08.309 --> 01:21:08.319 align:start position:0%
or killing himself and he said of course
 
01:21:11.309 --> 01:21:11.319 align:start position:0%
I have and I had this pause and I I
 
01:21:12.670 --> 01:21:12.680 align:start position:0%
realized all of a sudden that I was in
 
01:21:15.429 --> 01:21:15.439 align:start position:0%
Vermont and there was an maid law and
 
01:21:17.030 --> 01:21:17.040 align:start position:0%
maybe I had an alternative for him and I
 
01:21:20.309 --> 01:21:20.319 align:start position:0%
said he I see said tell me all about it
 
01:21:22.870 --> 01:21:22.880 align:start position:0%
and that was my first experience in uh
 
01:21:24.870 --> 01:21:24.880 align:start position:0%
in educating myself about the Vermont
 
01:21:28.550 --> 01:21:28.560 align:start position:0%
aen dying law um since then um I have uh
 
01:21:30.429 --> 01:21:30.439 align:start position:0%
personally been involved with nine
 
01:21:33.510 --> 01:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
patients uh in uh under the Vermont
 
01:21:35.349 --> 01:21:35.359 align:start position:0%
statue two of them have been New
 
01:21:37.550 --> 01:21:37.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents who have come across
 
01:21:43.030 --> 01:21:43.040 align:start position:0%
the uh border to to receive care um none
 
01:21:45.510 --> 01:21:45.520 align:start position:0%
of these patients had any interest at
 
01:21:47.309 --> 01:21:47.319 align:start position:0%
all in allowing the disease to to
 
01:21:49.670 --> 01:21:49.680 align:start position:0%
control their death each was extremely
 
01:21:52.070 --> 01:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
grateful to be legally allowed some
 
01:21:54.110 --> 01:21:54.120 align:start position:0%
control over an otherwise otherwise
 
01:21:57.309 --> 01:21:57.319 align:start position:0%
uncontrollable process in 30 years of
 
01:21:59.750 --> 01:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
medical practice I have rarely seen a
 
01:22:03.190 --> 01:22:03.200 align:start position:0%
group of patients so appreciative of the
 
01:22:06.750 --> 01:22:06.760 align:start position:0%
care they have received families are
 
01:22:09.349 --> 01:22:09.359 align:start position:0%
also appreciative of the fact that there
 
01:22:11.670 --> 01:22:11.680 align:start position:0%
was a legal option to help minimize
 
01:22:14.429 --> 01:22:14.439 align:start position:0%
their suffering I have been involved in
 
01:22:18.150 --> 01:22:18.160 align:start position:0%
mult at the end of your time please yes
 
01:22:20.070 --> 01:22:20.080 align:start position:0%
so I have been involved in multiple
 
01:22:21.670 --> 01:22:21.680 align:start position:0%
multiple end of life
 
01:22:24.790 --> 01:22:24.800 align:start position:0%
issues sometimes as di Dr Bernard said
 
01:22:26.790 --> 01:22:26.800 align:start position:0%
at the press conference this morning
 
01:22:28.670 --> 01:22:28.680 align:start position:0%
sometimes we need other tools that we
 
01:22:32.590 --> 01:22:32.600 align:start position:0%
don't currently have and when there are
 
01:22:35.309 --> 01:22:35.319 align:start position:0%
completely uncontrollable symptoms or
 
01:22:38.110 --> 01:22:38.120 align:start position:0%
patients see an inevitable progression
 
01:22:41.190 --> 01:22:41.200 align:start position:0%
to a death without
 
01:22:44.429 --> 01:22:44.439 align:start position:0%
dignity they find this in my personal
 
01:22:46.750 --> 01:22:46.760 align:start position:0%
experience they have found this to be an
 
01:22:46.760 --> 01:22:47.870 align:start position:0%
experience they have found this to be an
incred

01:22:47.870 --> 01:22:47.880 align:start position:0%
incred

constituents Express a great deal of
 
01:24:11.870 --> 01:24:11.880 align:start position:0%
gratitude and I think you will find the
 
01:24:15.630 --> 01:24:15.640 align:start position:0%
same if you move ahead with this bill
 
01:24:17.950 --> 01:24:17.960 align:start position:0%
there's not been a single report of
 
01:24:21.070 --> 01:24:21.080 align:start position:0%
abuse or even suspected abuse in Vermont
 
01:24:22.630 --> 01:24:22.640 align:start position:0%
and that is a fact to which our
 
01:24:24.349 --> 01:24:24.359 align:start position:0%
department of health testified before
 
01:24:27.070 --> 01:24:27.080 align:start position:0%
our legislature last
 
01:24:31.030 --> 01:24:31.040 align:start position:0%
year when I when you look at the data um
 
01:24:33.590 --> 01:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
we now have some data about the number
 
01:24:35.950 --> 01:24:35.960 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire residents who are
 
01:24:38.590 --> 01:24:38.600 align:start position:0%
interested in Medical Aid and dying
 
01:24:41.870 --> 01:24:41.880 align:start position:0%
because there have been more than 600
 
01:24:44.550 --> 01:24:44.560 align:start position:0%
people who have looked at the Vermont um
 
01:24:47.070 --> 01:24:47.080 align:start position:0%
the patient choices Vermont website
 
01:24:50.550 --> 01:24:50.560 align:start position:0%
since our law was amended to allow um
 
01:24:52.670 --> 01:24:52.680 align:start position:0%
people from out of state to seek medical
 
01:24:55.269 --> 01:24:55.279 align:start position:0%
Aid in dying in Vermont and these people
 
01:24:57.630 --> 01:24:57.640 align:start position:0%
are your constituents many of them call
 
01:24:59.950 --> 01:24:59.960 align:start position:0%
our helpline they describe their
 
01:25:03.030 --> 01:25:03.040 align:start position:0%
illnesses and similar stories to what
 
01:25:04.550 --> 01:25:04.560 align:start position:0%
you are hearing
 
01:25:08.990 --> 01:25:09.000 align:start position:0%
today in the first 10 years of our act
 
01:25:13.190 --> 01:25:13.200 align:start position:0%
39 203 people used Medical Aid in dying
 
01:25:15.630 --> 01:25:15.640 align:start position:0%
in Vermont that's quite a small number
 
01:25:18.349 --> 01:25:18.359 align:start position:0%
it's a minuscule point 5% of all the
 
01:25:20.349 --> 01:25:20.359 align:start position:0%
deaths during that same
 
01:25:23.750 --> 01:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
period And yet Vermont doctors report
 
01:25:25.630 --> 01:25:25.640 align:start position:0%
that the number of people who are
 
01:25:27.990 --> 01:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
comforted by the option of Medical Aid
 
01:25:30.309 --> 01:25:30.319 align:start position:0%
and dying far exceeds the number who
 
01:25:33.230 --> 01:25:33.240 align:start position:0%
actually use it my personal experience
 
01:25:35.710 --> 01:25:35.720 align:start position:0%
with this I see you about to tell me
 
01:25:39.429 --> 01:25:39.439 align:start position:0%
that I'm going go over um uh confirms
 
01:25:42.349 --> 01:25:42.359 align:start position:0%
that as well one final thought um I
 
01:25:46.150 --> 01:25:46.160 align:start position:0%
would caution you uh very much to um
 
01:25:49.190 --> 01:25:49.200 align:start position:0%
research the Canada law before you
 
01:25:51.710 --> 01:25:51.720 align:start position:0%
compare what you have in front of you to
 
01:25:54.349 --> 01:25:54.359 align:start position:0%
Canada Canada has a very different
 
01:25:56.389 --> 01:25:56.399 align:start position:0%
constitutional Foundation behind their
 
01:25:58.349 --> 01:25:58.359 align:start position:0%
law than we do in the United States and
 
01:26:00.630 --> 01:26:00.640 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to discuss this with
 
01:26:02.670 --> 01:26:02.680 align:start position:0%
anybody who is researching that on the
 
01:26:06.630 --> 01:26:06.640 align:start position:0%
committee all right questions for this
 
01:26:09.030 --> 01:26:09.040 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you very much
 
01:26:10.870 --> 01:26:10.880 align:start position:0%
thank you next I'm going to call on
 
01:26:13.790 --> 01:26:13.800 align:start position:0%
Diana barnhard uh and the next witness
 
01:26:16.469 --> 01:26:16.479 align:start position:0%
after that will be Kevin gagan and again
 
01:26:18.150 --> 01:26:18.160 align:start position:0%
I'm you know I apologize I don't mean to
 
01:26:20.309 --> 01:26:20.319 align:start position:0%
be rude but I really am going to have to
 
01:26:22.550 --> 01:26:22.560 align:start position:0%
insist that you stick to the two minutes
 
01:26:26.070 --> 01:26:26.080 align:start position:0%
because these these the this stack is
 
01:26:28.590 --> 01:26:28.600 align:start position:0%
not all the people that wish to testify
 
01:26:29.750 --> 01:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
and we want to have everybody have an
 
01:26:33.269 --> 01:26:33.279 align:start position:0%
opportunity to be heard so uh Dr Barner
 
01:26:35.110 --> 01:26:35.120 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for uh the
 
01:26:36.590 --> 01:26:36.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak to you and I am
 
01:26:39.469 --> 01:26:39.479 align:start position:0%
mindful that I am a guest here um I am
 
01:26:41.429 --> 01:26:41.439 align:start position:0%
here to speak for the Vermont experience
 
01:26:43.269 --> 01:26:43.279 align:start position:0%
I'm board certified in both family
 
01:26:44.910 --> 01:26:44.920 align:start position:0%
medicine and hospice and paliative
 
01:26:47.030 --> 01:26:47.040 align:start position:0%
medicine I've been practicing for 30 30
 
01:26:49.190 --> 01:26:49.200 align:start position:0%
years and for the past 15 years I've
 
01:26:51.830 --> 01:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
been exclusively focused my Care on
 
01:26:54.030 --> 01:26:54.040 align:start position:0%
those living with serious illness I have
 
01:26:55.870 --> 01:26:55.880 align:start position:0%
a copy of my written testimony which I
 
01:26:58.230 --> 01:26:58.240 align:start position:0%
will pass around I really want to make
 
01:27:00.630 --> 01:27:00.640 align:start position:0%
two main points the first and most
 
01:27:02.910 --> 01:27:02.920 align:start position:0%
important one is that this is about
 
01:27:05.469 --> 01:27:05.479 align:start position:0%
patients this is not so much about
 
01:27:07.309 --> 01:27:07.319 align:start position:0%
Physicians it's not even so much about
 
01:27:09.990 --> 01:27:10.000 align:start position:0%
lawmakers it's about patients who are
 
01:27:12.750 --> 01:27:12.760 align:start position:0%
suffering and who fear suffering and who
 
01:27:15.309 --> 01:27:15.319 align:start position:0%
want to have the option of a measure of
 
01:27:18.429 --> 01:27:18.439 align:start position:0%
freedom and control when they are facing
 
01:27:21.150 --> 01:27:21.160 align:start position:0%
their own death we live longer than we
 
01:27:23.830 --> 01:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
used to live which is wonderful but that
 
01:27:26.150 --> 01:27:26.160 align:start position:0%
means in the Final Phase of life we're
 
01:27:28.670 --> 01:27:28.680 align:start position:0%
more likely to have a heavy burden and
 
01:27:31.269 --> 01:27:31.279 align:start position:0%
the truth is we need many tools to
 
01:27:33.550 --> 01:27:33.560 align:start position:0%
address this suffering hospice is a
 
01:27:35.590 --> 01:27:35.600 align:start position:0%
wonderful tool and it's essential for
 
01:27:37.870 --> 01:27:37.880 align:start position:0%
everybody who is in the terminal phase
 
01:27:41.830 --> 01:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
of illness but it's not always enough I
 
01:27:43.830 --> 01:27:43.840 align:start position:0%
cannot emphasize enough the deeply
 
01:27:46.110 --> 01:27:46.120 align:start position:0%
personal nature of suffering and the
 
01:27:49.030 --> 01:27:49.040 align:start position:0%
importance of listening to everybody and
 
01:27:51.150 --> 01:27:51.160 align:start position:0%
having many tools to address their
 
01:27:53.790 --> 01:27:53.800 align:start position:0%
suffering the patients that I see want
 
01:27:57.030 --> 01:27:57.040 align:start position:0%
to live it's only when they must accept
 
01:27:59.429 --> 01:27:59.439 align:start position:0%
that they are dying that they want to
 
01:28:00.950 --> 01:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
have a little bit of freedom and a
 
01:28:03.990 --> 01:28:04.000 align:start position:0%
little bit of control about how they die
 
01:28:05.870 --> 01:28:05.880 align:start position:0%
most patients tell me they want three
 
01:28:08.150 --> 01:28:08.160 align:start position:0%
simple things to be at home to be
 
01:28:10.429 --> 01:28:10.439 align:start position:0%
surrounded by loved ones and to be
 
01:28:13.429 --> 01:28:13.439 align:start position:0%
comfortable however they Define that the
 
01:28:16.070 --> 01:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
truth is that that's hard to achieve in
 
01:28:18.510 --> 01:28:18.520 align:start position:0%
this state and in my state of Vermont
 
01:28:21.030 --> 01:28:21.040 align:start position:0%
Medical Aid and dying offers those
 
01:28:23.750 --> 01:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
patients that choice the second point I
 
01:28:25.349 --> 01:28:25.359 align:start position:0%
want to make is that Medical Aid and
 
01:28:27.750 --> 01:28:27.760 align:start position:0%
dying laws can work and they work well
 
01:28:29.990 --> 01:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
and they are not being abused we have
 
01:28:31.630 --> 01:28:31.640 align:start position:0%
more than 10 years of experience in
 
01:28:34.309 --> 01:28:34.319 align:start position:0%
Vermont there's close to 25 years of
 
01:28:36.710 --> 01:28:36.720 align:start position:0%
experience in Oregon I encourage you to
 
01:28:38.630 --> 01:28:38.640 align:start position:0%
look at the data and understand that
 
01:28:41.469 --> 01:28:41.479 align:start position:0%
this is not being abused that the rights
 
01:28:43.950 --> 01:28:43.960 align:start position:0%
of patients and Physicians who choose
 
01:28:46.590 --> 01:28:46.600 align:start position:0%
not to participate are fully protected
 
01:28:50.429 --> 01:28:50.439 align:start position:0%
Ed Under This law it's an option and it
 
01:28:52.230 --> 01:28:52.240 align:start position:0%
gives a measure of control for people
 
01:28:54.710 --> 01:28:54.720 align:start position:0%
who desperately need it all right thank
 
01:28:56.550 --> 01:28:56.560 align:start position:0%
you questions for this
 
01:28:59.630 --> 01:28:59.640 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you very much
 
01:29:02.110 --> 01:29:02.120 align:start position:0%
uh Kevin gagan and the next witness
 
01:29:12.550 --> 01:29:12.560 align:start position:0%

01:29:18.230 --> 01:29:18.240 align:start position:0%
morning thank you for this opportunity
 
01:29:22.790 --> 01:29:22.800 align:start position:0%
um I was compelled to come here today um
 
01:29:24.469 --> 01:29:24.479 align:start position:0%
hearing about this
 
01:29:26.710 --> 01:29:26.720 align:start position:0%
legislation and you know I notice a lot
 
01:29:29.469 --> 01:29:29.479 align:start position:0%
of talk or hear or see you know talk
 
01:29:32.910 --> 01:29:32.920 align:start position:0%
about Live Free or Die um I guess the
 
01:29:34.910 --> 01:29:34.920 align:start position:0%
way I see it as a granite stor it's Live
 
01:29:39.150 --> 01:29:39.160 align:start position:0%
Free or Die not live free and die um and
 
01:29:42.110 --> 01:29:42.120 align:start position:0%
you know I I'd like to see New Hampshire
 
01:29:44.870 --> 01:29:44.880 align:start position:0%
uh represent a culture of life not
 
01:29:48.710 --> 01:29:48.720 align:start position:0%
death um I happen to have at least three
 
01:29:50.670 --> 01:29:50.680 align:start position:0%
or four close people in my life that
 
01:29:52.150 --> 01:29:52.160 align:start position:0%
actually committed
 
01:29:54.950 --> 01:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
suicide um so I just I simply don't
 
01:29:57.750 --> 01:29:57.760 align:start position:0%
believe that suicide is a
 
01:30:00.670 --> 01:30:00.680 align:start position:0%
solution so in in additionally I'm
 
01:30:02.630 --> 01:30:02.640 align:start position:0%
shooting off the cfia as I believe you
 
01:30:05.910 --> 01:30:05.920 align:start position:0%
had suggested um I don't have a written
 
01:30:07.550 --> 01:30:07.560 align:start position:0%
speech I just woke up this morning and
 
01:30:09.910 --> 01:30:09.920 align:start position:0%
wrote a bunch of notes here um
 
01:30:12.110 --> 01:30:12.120 align:start position:0%
interestingly my my son who's in seventh
 
01:30:14.190 --> 01:30:14.200 align:start position:0%
grade is going to currently be um
 
01:30:16.990 --> 01:30:17.000 align:start position:0%
learning about suicide so I you know I I
 
01:30:19.030 --> 01:30:19.040 align:start position:0%
felt compelled to you know discuss this
 
01:30:22.429 --> 01:30:22.439 align:start position:0%
with his uh with his counselor and you
 
01:30:25.070 --> 01:30:25.080 align:start position:0%
know just talk about it and uh I just
 
01:30:27.030 --> 01:30:27.040 align:start position:0%
think it's a very sensitive matter and I
 
01:30:30.870 --> 01:30:30.880 align:start position:0%
just uh you know my hope is that this
 
01:30:33.950 --> 01:30:33.960 align:start position:0%
committee um you know will value life
 
01:30:37.269 --> 01:30:37.279 align:start position:0%
life from the beginning to the end right
 
01:30:39.550 --> 01:30:39.560 align:start position:0%
and we just you know again the live for
 
01:30:41.630 --> 01:30:41.640 align:start position:0%
you die I'll finish on this I don't
 
01:30:44.670 --> 01:30:44.680 align:start position:0%
think it was intended for suicide to be
 
01:30:46.590 --> 01:30:46.600 align:start position:0%
the die principle I think it was was
 
01:30:49.030 --> 01:30:49.040 align:start position:0%
intended for Patriots to stand up and do
 
01:30:50.990 --> 01:30:51.000 align:start position:0%
what they need to thank you right thank
 
01:30:52.830 --> 01:30:52.840 align:start position:0%

former representative Christine ham from
 
01:31:24.790 --> 01:31:24.800 align:start position:0%
Hopkinton who now lives in Portland
 
01:31:27.870 --> 01:31:27.880 align:start position:0%

Carl of Hopkinton my former law partner
 
01:31:53.990 --> 01:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
uh Lucy I believe has already submitted
 
01:31:56.150 --> 01:31:56.160 align:start position:0%
her full testimony to the committee so
 
01:31:58.309 --> 01:31:58.319 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to be very brief because
 
01:32:02.349 --> 01:32:02.359 align:start position:0%
I also have my own observations her son
 
01:32:06.309 --> 01:32:06.319 align:start position:0%
Alexander known as xan had a fiveyear
 
01:32:10.230 --> 01:32:10.240 align:start position:0%
battle with pancreatic cancer um he died
 
01:32:13.150 --> 01:32:13.160 align:start position:0%
uh shortly before Thanksgiving in
 
01:32:16.630 --> 01:32:16.640 align:start position:0%
2019 uh bedbound in his final day when
 
01:32:19.790 --> 01:32:19.800 align:start position:0%
he entered hospice he and his family
 
01:32:21.790 --> 01:32:21.800 align:start position:0%
made the decision to obtain a
 
01:32:25.030 --> 01:32:25.040 align:start position:0%
prescription under Oregon's U Oregon's
 
01:32:27.670 --> 01:32:27.680 align:start position:0%
law he had three reasons one
 
01:32:30.030 --> 01:32:30.040 align:start position:0%
preservation of his dignity and autonomy
 
01:32:33.469 --> 01:32:33.479 align:start position:0%
as the pain became insurmountable two
 
01:32:36.910 --> 01:32:36.920 align:start position:0%
control over his disease so that he was
 
01:32:39.950 --> 01:32:39.960 align:start position:0%
making the decisions not the cancer and
 
01:32:42.670 --> 01:32:42.680 align:start position:0%
three and most important control over
 
01:32:45.070 --> 01:32:45.080 align:start position:0%
how he would die peacefully and
 
01:32:47.590 --> 01:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
comfortably and ensuring his beloved
 
01:32:50.510 --> 01:32:50.520 align:start position:0%
wife and his then three-year-old son
 
01:32:53.990 --> 01:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
were not traumatized by his last days I
 
01:32:56.309 --> 01:32:56.319 align:start position:0%
just want to point up the importance to
 
01:33:00.429 --> 01:33:00.439 align:start position:0%
Lucy to the family to the friends and to
 
01:33:03.429 --> 01:33:03.439 align:start position:0%
xan that the opportunity for him to make
 
01:33:06.910 --> 01:33:06.920 align:start position:0%
a choice about how he would die was
 
01:33:09.349 --> 01:33:09.359 align:start position:0%
absolutely critical in the end he didn't
 
01:33:11.670 --> 01:33:11.680 align:start position:0%
use the prescription but the peace of
 
01:33:13.910 --> 01:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
mind that it gave him and those around
 
01:33:16.630 --> 01:33:16.640 align:start position:0%
him is an invaluable lesson Lucy

me good morning ladies and gentlemen sir
 
01:34:01.510 --> 01:34:01.520 align:start position:0%
and madams I was going to begin by
 
01:34:03.469 --> 01:34:03.479 align:start position:0%
saying to whom this may concern and then
 
01:34:05.990 --> 01:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
I realize that This concerns everyone
 
01:34:08.110 --> 01:34:08.120 align:start position:0%
everyone in this room is going to die
 
01:34:09.790 --> 01:34:09.800 align:start position:0%
and most likely everyone knows someone
 
01:34:12.670 --> 01:34:12.680 align:start position:0%
who is dying or someone who has died
 
01:34:14.950 --> 01:34:14.960 align:start position:0%
imagine if you were dying and you had no
 
01:34:16.990 --> 01:34:17.000 align:start position:0%
control over where you are
 
01:34:20.150 --> 01:34:20.160 align:start position:0%
who is going to be there zero control
 
01:34:22.269 --> 01:34:22.279 align:start position:0%
imagine if you had to vomit feal matter
 
01:34:24.590 --> 01:34:24.600 align:start position:0%
imagine if you were in constant pain
 
01:34:27.269 --> 01:34:27.279 align:start position:0%
imagine if you had people around you who
 
01:34:29.110 --> 01:34:29.120 align:start position:0%
who you did not want to be there at that
 
01:34:31.389 --> 01:34:31.399 align:start position:0%
time that is not a death that I want for
 
01:34:34.590 --> 01:34:34.600 align:start position:0%
me my family my friends or anyone in
 
01:34:37.790 --> 01:34:37.800 align:start position:0%
this room or in our state options
 
01:34:40.070 --> 01:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
options are good options are for
 
01:34:43.070 --> 01:34:43.080 align:start position:0%
everyone everyone should have the option
 
01:34:44.510 --> 01:34:44.520 align:start position:0%
having an option does not mean that
 
01:34:47.790 --> 01:34:47.800 align:start position:0%
you're going to act on it you it need it
 
01:34:50.269 --> 01:34:50.279 align:start position:0%
having the option there knowing that you
 
01:34:52.510 --> 01:34:52.520 align:start position:0%
have that control knowing you could
 
01:34:54.550 --> 01:34:54.560 align:start position:0%
choose who you wanted by your bedside
 
01:34:56.950 --> 01:34:56.960 align:start position:0%

nurse Doula was with us he was talking
 
01:36:44.870 --> 01:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
and up and about the day before and and

when Sunday came around around that's
 
01:36:49.550 --> 01:36:49.560 align:start position:0%
the day he decided to die hospice didn't

consciously he actually squeezed my
 
01:36:58.800 --> 01:37:00.429 align:start position:0%
consciously he actually squeezed my
hand

01:37:00.429 --> 01:37:00.439 align:start position:0%
hand
 
01:37:02.990 --> 01:37:03.000 align:start position:0%
and we didn't have to give him a lot of
 
01:37:05.670 --> 01:37:05.680 align:start position:0%
medicine except Mor a little bit of
 
01:37:10.110 --> 01:37:10.120 align:start position:0%
morphine I'm here now to say the rest of
 
01:37:11.750 --> 01:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
us need
 
01:37:14.790 --> 01:37:14.800 align:start position:0%
this I'm thinking of the word
 
01:37:17.630 --> 01:37:17.640 align:start position:0%
opportunity what if Steve had had the
 
01:37:20.389 --> 01:37:20.399 align:start position:0%
opportunity to know how long he would
 
01:37:23.630 --> 01:37:23.640 align:start position:0%
live what if he had experiences that I
 
01:37:25.429 --> 01:37:25.439 align:start position:0%
can't even imagine he would be looking
 
01:37:28.469 --> 01:37:28.479 align:start position:0%
forward to what if my daughters our
 
01:37:31.790 --> 01:37:31.800 align:start position:0%
daughters had a chance to be with him
 
01:37:34.830 --> 01:37:34.840 align:start position:0%
more because they knew he was going to
 
01:37:38.309 --> 01:37:38.319 align:start position:0%
die it is really critical that we treat
 
01:37:40.910 --> 01:37:40.920 align:start position:0%

01:37:40.920 --> 01:37:42.190 align:start position:0%

comment I I knew Dr bar so he has missed
 
01:41:20.710 --> 01:41:20.720 align:start position:0%
and actually
 
01:41:22.950 --> 01:41:22.960 align:start position:0%

saw her so like we keep her in our
 
01:41:46.309 --> 01:41:46.319 align:start position:0%

01:42:02.030 --> 01:42:02.040 align:start position:0%
Hopkin good morning thank you for
 
01:42:05.230 --> 01:42:05.240 align:start position:0%
hearing me my name is Fran chiking I was
 
01:42:07.429 --> 01:42:07.439 align:start position:0%
born and raised here in New Hampshire
 
01:42:09.070 --> 01:42:09.080 align:start position:0%
we've raised our family in the granite
 
01:42:11.870 --> 01:42:11.880 align:start position:0%
state I'm here to support hb1
 
01:42:15.910 --> 01:42:15.920 align:start position:0%
1283 New Hampshire end of life options
 
01:42:18.870 --> 01:42:18.880 align:start position:0%
like many of you I bet I have seen
 
01:42:21.590 --> 01:42:21.600 align:start position:0%
people who have died of cancer in my
 
01:42:23.870 --> 01:42:23.880 align:start position:0%
case the people that I know had
 
01:42:27.110 --> 01:42:27.120 align:start position:0%
pancreatic cancer they had bone cancer
 
01:42:31.710 --> 01:42:31.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:35.269 --> 01:42:35.279 align:start position:0%
the there were heroic efforts to try to
 
01:42:37.870 --> 01:42:37.880 align:start position:0%
save those folks and try to alleviate
 
01:42:40.309 --> 01:42:40.319 align:start position:0%
all the suffering but of course as many
 
01:42:43.469 --> 01:42:43.479 align:start position:0%
of you know that isn't always possible
 
01:42:46.469 --> 01:42:46.479 align:start position:0%
and so as a family member you're there
 
01:42:48.349 --> 01:42:48.359 align:start position:0%
you see the suffering you see the
 
01:42:51.349 --> 01:42:51.359 align:start position:0%
terrible pain and you would want to take
 
01:42:57.590 --> 01:42:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:00.630 --> 01:43:00.640 align:start position:0%
can't my folks did not have the option
 
01:43:04.230 --> 01:43:04.240 align:start position:0%
of an end of life choice if they had
 
01:43:06.389 --> 01:43:06.399 align:start position:0%
lived in Vermont or in Maine they would
 
01:43:08.910 --> 01:43:08.920 align:start position:0%
have had that option and so I'm here to
 
01:43:11.269 --> 01:43:11.279 align:start position:0%
support this bill because there's one of
 
01:43:13.070 --> 01:43:13.080 align:start position:0%
those three people who would have chosen
 
01:43:15.389 --> 01:43:15.399 align:start position:0%
this who would have made that decision
 
01:43:17.510 --> 01:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
and they weren't able to I'm here in
 
01:43:19.510 --> 01:43:19.520 align:start position:0%
support of that in memory of that person
 
01:43:21.790 --> 01:43:21.800 align:start position:0%
who I loved but also for the other
 
01:43:23.510 --> 01:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
people in New Hampshire who want this
 
01:43:26.150 --> 01:43:26.160 align:start position:0%
choice and that includes
 
01:43:29.630 --> 01:43:29.640 align:start position:0%
me I've had cancer I have had
 
01:43:32.510 --> 01:43:32.520 align:start position:0%
chemotherapy I've had radiation I've had
 
01:43:35.110 --> 01:43:35.120 align:start position:0%
surgery I know what that experience is
 
01:43:37.750 --> 01:43:37.760 align:start position:0%
like and I don't know what's going to
 
01:43:39.630 --> 01:43:39.640 align:start position:0%
happen other than I know death is a
 
01:43:42.389 --> 01:43:42.399 align:start position:0%
certainty will the cancer occur I don't
 
01:43:45.030 --> 01:43:45.040 align:start position:0%
know if it does if I'm in a terminal
 
01:43:47.990 --> 01:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
state State and I have 6 months to live
 
01:43:50.830 --> 01:43:50.840 align:start position:0%
I want this option I don't know if I'd
 
01:43:52.790 --> 01:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
use it I don't know if I'd be brave
 
01:43:55.510 --> 01:43:55.520 align:start position:0%
enough but as representative Palmer said
 
01:43:58.269 --> 01:43:58.279 align:start position:0%
just to have that as a possibility would
 
01:44:02.150 --> 01:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
bring me peace right so I'm here to
 
01:44:04.429 --> 01:44:04.439 align:start position:0%
support this for the people that I love
 
01:44:06.429 --> 01:44:06.439 align:start position:0%
but also for myself
 
01:44:10.269 --> 01:44:10.279 align:start position:0%
selfishly and I hope that you folks will
 
01:44:13.349 --> 01:44:13.359 align:start position:0%
look at this bill and consider the
 
01:44:15.990 --> 01:44:16.000 align:start position:0%
people have spoken and support it and
 
01:44:18.830 --> 01:44:18.840 align:start position:0%
find a way to pass this and give options
 
01:44:20.550 --> 01:44:20.560 align:start position:0%
for the people in New Hampshire thank
 
01:44:21.870 --> 01:44:21.880 align:start position:0%

uh Gary York retired physician from
 
01:44:50.910 --> 01:44:50.920 align:start position:0%
Hopkinson New
 
01:44:54.190 --> 01:44:54.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire our medical freedoms have been
 
01:44:57.469 --> 01:44:57.479 align:start position:0%
eroded over the past few years as New
 
01:45:00.190 --> 01:45:00.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizens this bill bolsters
 
01:45:02.389 --> 01:45:02.399 align:start position:0%
our inherent right to have control of
 
01:45:04.150 --> 01:45:04.160 align:start position:0%
our bodies and
 
01:45:06.870 --> 01:45:06.880 align:start position:0%
ourselves this bill is a bill for a
 
01:45:09.710 --> 01:45:09.720 align:start position:0%
choice for New Hampshire
 
01:45:13.150 --> 01:45:13.160 align:start position:0%
citizens I'd like to address the uh
 
01:45:16.230 --> 01:45:16.240 align:start position:0%
acronym made Medical Aid or medical
 
01:45:19.790 --> 01:45:19.800 align:start position:0%
assistance in dying and I emphasize
 
01:45:23.269 --> 01:45:23.279 align:start position:0%
dying this is a process that has started
 
01:45:26.389 --> 01:45:26.399 align:start position:0%
at least by the estimation of two
 
01:45:29.030 --> 01:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
Advanced Care Medical
 
01:45:31.309 --> 01:45:31.319 align:start position:0%
practitioners uh there's no Insight
 
01:45:33.630 --> 01:45:33.640 align:start position:0%
that's definite but there is a start
 
01:45:37.070 --> 01:45:37.080 align:start position:0%
point and vetting by two uh
 
01:45:41.389 --> 01:45:41.399 align:start position:0%
practitioners that this is happening uh
 
01:45:45.110 --> 01:45:45.120 align:start position:0%
this is a process so this is not called
 
01:45:49.309 --> 01:45:49.319 align:start position:0%
m a TD Medical Aid to die this is
 
01:45:52.389 --> 01:45:52.399 align:start position:0%
a acronym that explains the process of
 
01:45:54.790 --> 01:45:54.800 align:start position:0%
an active
 
01:45:58.190 --> 01:45:58.200 align:start position:0%
dying uh this bill allows the
 
01:46:01.389 --> 01:46:01.399 align:start position:0%
individual the ability to make the
 
01:46:05.710 --> 01:46:05.720 align:start position:0%
decision of how and when they leave this
 
01:46:09.670 --> 01:46:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:11.950 --> 01:46:11.960 align:start position:0%
compassion and a bill of choice and a
 
01:46:14.630 --> 01:46:14.640 align:start position:0%
bill of medical Freedom so if someone
 
01:46:17.750 --> 01:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
were to ask me if you had 6 months to
 
01:46:20.590 --> 01:46:20.600 align:start position:0%
live what would you do my answer would
 
01:46:24.670 --> 01:46:24.680 align:start position:0%
be I try my hardest to help pass a bill
 
01:46:27.150 --> 01:46:27.160 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire that guaranteed our
 
01:46:30.710 --> 01:46:30.720 align:start position:0%

Catholic War veterans all these
 
01:47:55.190 --> 01:47:55.200 align:start position:0%
organizations strongly oppose this why
 
01:47:57.190 --> 01:47:57.200 align:start position:0%
they said it's not a veterans issue we
 
01:47:59.950 --> 01:47:59.960 align:start position:0%
tell that to my nephew who after three
 
01:48:01.910 --> 01:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
years of Iraq couldn't take it anymore
 
01:48:05.030 --> 01:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
and end it his life suicide is a
 
01:48:08.830 --> 01:48:08.840 align:start position:0%
oneperson thing assisted suicide is
 
01:48:11.070 --> 01:48:11.080 align:start position:0%
technically murder if there was someone
 
01:48:12.910 --> 01:48:12.920 align:start position:0%
standing on that ledge across the way at
 
01:48:15.150 --> 01:48:15.160 align:start position:0%
a capital building who was ter really
 
01:48:17.630 --> 01:48:17.640 align:start position:0%
ill and was going to die in a month and
 
01:48:21.110 --> 01:48:21.120 align:start position:0%
I pushed him did I assist in his suicide
 
01:48:23.230 --> 01:48:23.240 align:start position:0%
or did I murder him that's the question
 
01:48:26.590 --> 01:48:26.600 align:start position:0%
suicide is very simple it is just me it
 
01:48:28.469 --> 01:48:28.479 align:start position:0%
is my decision all of us have that
 
01:48:30.510 --> 01:48:30.520 align:start position:0%
choice I can go home and down a bunch of
 
01:48:32.429 --> 01:48:32.439 align:start position:0%
pills right now and I'll be dead by
 
01:48:35.670 --> 01:48:35.680 align:start position:0%

01:48:39.030 --> 01:48:39.040 align:start position:0%
state does not have to assist us we
 
01:48:41.910 --> 01:48:41.920 align:start position:0%
suicide does not need help tell that to
 
01:48:43.910 --> 01:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
my nephew tell that to my granddaughter
 
01:48:47.710 --> 01:48:47.720 align:start position:0%
who died of a drug overdose suicide is
 
01:48:50.630 --> 01:48:50.640 align:start position:0%
assisted is murder and to correct
 
01:48:53.630 --> 01:48:53.640 align:start position:0%
something it was stated respectfully
 
01:48:57.030 --> 01:48:57.040 align:start position:0%
from uh representative Smith that our
 
01:48:58.870 --> 01:48:58.880 align:start position:0%
constitution said there's a separation
 
01:49:01.590 --> 01:49:01.600 align:start position:0%
of church and state and it's not in the
 
01:49:03.030 --> 01:49:03.040 align:start position:0%
Constitution it's not in the Bill of
 
01:49:04.950 --> 01:49:04.960 align:start position:0%
Rights but it is in letters from Thomas
 
01:49:07.190 --> 01:49:07.200 align:start position:0%
and Jefferson and yet we still say one
 
01:49:09.150 --> 01:49:09.160 align:start position:0%
nation under God and our money still
 
01:49:11.030 --> 01:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
says in God we
 
01:49:11.040 --> 01:49:12.630 align:start position:0%
says in God we
trust

01:49:12.630 --> 01:49:12.640 align:start position:0%
trust
 
01:49:16.150 --> 01:49:16.160 align:start position:0%
people take it from a man who thousands
 
01:49:18.150 --> 01:49:18.160 align:start position:0%
of years ago was in pain more than we
 
01:49:21.030 --> 01:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
can ever understand and it was going to
 
01:49:23.110 --> 01:49:23.120 align:start position:0%
be dead before the end of the
 
01:49:25.750 --> 01:49:25.760 align:start position:0%
day and he said the day will come when
 
01:49:27.630 --> 01:49:27.640 align:start position:0%
Mountains will want men will want
 
01:49:30.070 --> 01:49:30.080 align:start position:0%
mountains to fall upon them and Hills to
 
01:49:32.469 --> 01:49:32.479 align:start position:0%
cover them and if they can do that when
 
01:49:33.710 --> 01:49:33.720 align:start position:0%
the wood is dry what are they going to
 
01:49:35.510 --> 01:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
do with is green another when the red is
 
01:49:38.030 --> 01:49:38.040 align:start position:0%
green what it's going to do with it is
 
01:49:41.110 --> 01:49:41.120 align:start position:0%
dry if we can do this now if we can
 
01:49:43.710 --> 01:49:43.720 align:start position:0%
start killing allowing people to kill
 
01:49:46.309 --> 01:49:46.319 align:start position:0%
themselves I just dealt with a veteran
 
01:49:49.389 --> 01:49:49.399 align:start position:0%
up in conquer dying suc of cancer stage
 
01:49:52.229 --> 01:49:52.239 align:start position:0%
four pump full of morphine and yet still
 
01:49:53.870 --> 01:49:53.880 align:start position:0%
was making plans to get his family
 
01:49:56.510 --> 01:49:56.520 align:start position:0%
together to find a church here to to get
 
01:49:58.750 --> 01:49:58.760 align:start position:0%
he wasn't planning on dying he was
 
01:50:02.550 --> 01:50:02.560 align:start position:0%
suffering he was maxed out on
 
01:50:06.229 --> 01:50:06.239 align:start position:0%
morphine but to say that we have a right
 
01:50:10.870 --> 01:50:10.880 align:start position:0%
we have a the authority to help people
 
01:50:14.070 --> 01:50:14.080 align:start position:0%
die that is very questionable the doctor
 
01:50:17.830 --> 01:50:17.840 align:start position:0%
mentioned four if the first dose don't P
 
01:50:19.670 --> 01:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
that the patient themselves pushed
 
01:50:21.790 --> 01:50:21.800 align:start position:0%
that's suicide but if that first dose
 
01:50:24.950 --> 01:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't work the doctor has to apply a
 
01:50:27.790 --> 01:50:27.800 align:start position:0%
deadly solution at that point it is no
 
01:50:30.870 --> 01:50:30.880 align:start position:0%
longer suicide the doctor commits murder
 
01:50:33.429 --> 01:50:33.439 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much questions
 
01:50:37.070 --> 01:50:37.080 align:start position:0%
for this witness thank you very much sir
 
01:50:39.309 --> 01:50:39.319 align:start position:0%
Kevin Grady I hope I I hope I got that
 
01:50:43.630 --> 01:50:43.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:43.640 --> 01:50:50.710 align:start position:0%
 
Kaplan

01:50:50.710 --> 01:50:50.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:52.150 --> 01:50:52.160 align:start position:0%
thank you good morning Mr chairman
 
01:50:53.469 --> 01:50:53.479 align:start position:0%
ladies and gentleman of the committee
 
01:50:55.510 --> 01:50:55.520 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Kevin Grady
 
01:50:57.429 --> 01:50:57.439 align:start position:0%
I'm a 25- year Air Force veteran and I'm
 
01:50:59.990 --> 01:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
a a 25 year resident of the town of
 
01:51:02.030 --> 01:51:02.040 align:start position:0%
hookit New Hampshire I did speak to you
 
01:51:04.710 --> 01:51:04.720 align:start position:0%
guys a couple weeks ago so you know um
 
01:51:06.110 --> 01:51:06.120 align:start position:0%
what the state veterans advisory
 
01:51:08.870 --> 01:51:08.880 align:start position:0%
committee is all about uh we had our our
 
01:51:11.190 --> 01:51:11.200 align:start position:0%
meeting last night for about 30 minutes
 
01:51:12.630 --> 01:51:12.640 align:start position:0%
and discussed this and there was a
 
01:51:14.990 --> 01:51:15.000 align:start position:0%
rather animated discussion on it and I
 
01:51:17.590 --> 01:51:17.600 align:start position:0%
want to tell you that this bill scares
 
01:51:19.750 --> 01:51:19.760 align:start position:0%
our members right down to their
 
01:51:22.030 --> 01:51:22.040 align:start position:0%
socks we've spent the better part of the
 
01:51:23.830 --> 01:51:23.840 align:start position:0%
last decade trying to get our arms
 
01:51:26.190 --> 01:51:26.200 align:start position:0%
around the fact that while veterans are
 
01:51:27.990 --> 01:51:28.000 align:start position:0%
a relatively small portion of our
 
01:51:30.469 --> 01:51:30.479 align:start position:0%
population we have a really really
 
01:51:32.950 --> 01:51:32.960 align:start position:0%
outsized number when it comes to
 
01:51:36.190 --> 01:51:36.200 align:start position:0%
suicides against the regular uh people
 
01:51:39.710 --> 01:51:39.720 align:start position:0%
who are not veterans and our concern is
 
01:51:42.269 --> 01:51:42.279 align:start position:0%
not with this bill as written we
 
01:51:44.150 --> 01:51:44.160 align:start position:0%
understand the folks that put this in
 
01:51:46.870 --> 01:51:46.880 align:start position:0%
have good intentions we understand that
 
01:51:50.670 --> 01:51:50.680 align:start position:0%
this is a bipartisan Bill uh but our
 
01:51:53.349 --> 01:51:53.359 align:start position:0%
concern is that places where this has
 
01:51:57.510 --> 01:51:57.520 align:start position:0%
been uh in in the country uh you tend to
 
01:51:59.269 --> 01:51:59.279 align:start position:0%
ultimately once it's been in place for a
 
01:52:00.830 --> 01:52:00.840 align:start position:0%
little while get something that we would
 
01:52:03.630 --> 01:52:03.640 align:start position:0%
call Mission creep and while it right
 
01:52:05.630 --> 01:52:05.640 align:start position:0%
now it's a fairly narrow portion of the
 
01:52:08.309 --> 01:52:08.319 align:start position:0%
population that qualifies for this our
 
01:52:10.710 --> 01:52:10.720 align:start position:0%
concern is that mental health concerns
 
01:52:12.550 --> 01:52:12.560 align:start position:0%
and other things may weigh into this at
 
01:52:15.469 --> 01:52:15.479 align:start position:0%
some point and this pool could get
 
01:52:18.510 --> 01:52:18.520 align:start position:0%
expanded so our are folks opposed this
 
01:52:20.870 --> 01:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
bill uh and that's all I wanted to tell
 
01:52:23.229 --> 01:52:23.239 align:start position:0%
you sir all right thank you questions
 
01:52:24.790 --> 01:52:24.800 align:start position:0%
for this
 
01:52:27.309 --> 01:52:27.319 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you very much
 
01:52:30.670 --> 01:52:30.680 align:start position:0%
thank you um Mark Kaplan and next will
 
01:52:39.190 --> 01:52:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:41.590 --> 01:52:41.600 align:start position:0%
Norton good morning Mr chairman and
 
01:52:43.790 --> 01:52:43.800 align:start position:0%
committee members thank you for hearing
 
01:52:45.670 --> 01:52:45.680 align:start position:0%
my testimony
 
01:52:49.229 --> 01:52:49.239 align:start position:0%
I'm here to advocate for passage of HB
 
01:52:52.429 --> 01:52:52.439 align:start position:0%
1283 I'm Jewish and have a traditional
 
01:52:55.190 --> 01:52:55.200 align:start position:0%
Jewish upbringing as an adult I spent
 
01:52:56.870 --> 01:52:56.880 align:start position:0%
many years involved with my Jewish
 
01:53:00.269 --> 01:53:00.279 align:start position:0%
Community Helping start a synagogue and
 
01:53:02.790 --> 01:53:02.800 align:start position:0%
uh working on the Jewish Community
 
01:53:04.630 --> 01:53:04.640 align:start position:0%
Center and Jewish
 
01:53:07.670 --> 01:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
Federation I bring a Jewish influence to
 
01:53:11.550 --> 01:53:11.560 align:start position:0%
my views of this option my Jewish
 
01:53:13.510 --> 01:53:13.520 align:start position:0%
parents were also strong supporters of
 
01:53:16.349 --> 01:53:16.359 align:start position:0%
end of life option going back decades
 
01:53:18.349 --> 01:53:18.359 align:start position:0%
unfortunately my father who died a year
 
01:53:20.190 --> 01:53:20.200 align:start position:0%
and a half ago did not have an option
 
01:53:22.910 --> 01:53:22.920 align:start position:0%
for Medical Aid and dying instead he
 
01:53:25.070 --> 01:53:25.080 align:start position:0%
chose to voluntarily stop eating and
 
01:53:27.429 --> 01:53:27.439 align:start position:0%
drinking to bring an end to his
 
01:53:29.910 --> 01:53:29.920 align:start position:0%
suffering it's not a great way to go he
 
01:53:33.190 --> 01:53:33.200 align:start position:0%
was 93 and a half on the day he died by
 
01:53:34.750 --> 01:53:34.760 align:start position:0%
that day he was sedated in
 
01:53:36.710 --> 01:53:36.720 align:start position:0%
unconsciousness and we were unable to
 
01:53:38.389 --> 01:53:38.399 align:start position:0%
have the kind of goodbyes that we would
 
01:53:40.790 --> 01:53:40.800 align:start position:0%
have liked I'm here today because he
 
01:53:42.950 --> 01:53:42.960 align:start position:0%
would want me to be here he was a great
 
01:53:45.950 --> 01:53:45.960 align:start position:0%
role model for taking a stand and making
 
01:53:48.389 --> 01:53:48.399 align:start position:0%
the effort to make make a difference for
 
01:53:50.910 --> 01:53:50.920 align:start position:0%
others nothing can change how he ended
 
01:53:52.950 --> 01:53:52.960 align:start position:0%
his life but we can change things for
 
01:53:55.150 --> 01:53:55.160 align:start position:0%
others passage of this bill would
 
01:53:57.309 --> 01:53:57.319 align:start position:0%
relieve suffering and provide Comfort to
 
01:53:59.550 --> 01:53:59.560 align:start position:0%
those who qualify and wish to have
 
01:54:01.990 --> 01:54:02.000 align:start position:0%
options at the end of their lives as a
 
01:54:04.070 --> 01:54:04.080 align:start position:0%
Jew I believe this is an example of what
 
01:54:07.110 --> 01:54:07.120 align:start position:0%
is called tun olum repairing and
 
01:54:08.550 --> 01:54:08.560 align:start position:0%
improving the
 
01:54:11.229 --> 01:54:11.239 align:start position:0%
world now that I've provided my Jewish
 
01:54:13.950 --> 01:54:13.960 align:start position:0%
perspective I com feel compelled to say
 
01:54:16.550 --> 01:54:16.560 align:start position:0%
that in enacting this bill should not be
 
01:54:19.349 --> 01:54:19.359 align:start position:0%
should be about humanity and relieving
 
01:54:22.710 --> 01:54:22.720 align:start position:0%
suffering not religion in fact it is
 
01:54:24.590 --> 01:54:24.600 align:start position:0%
important to point out that despite the
 
01:54:27.469 --> 01:54:27.479 align:start position:0%
vocalized opposition of some organized
 
01:54:30.030 --> 01:54:30.040 align:start position:0%
religious institutions the granite state
 
01:54:33.670 --> 01:54:33.680 align:start position:0%
survey conducted by UNH makes clear that
 
01:54:36.469 --> 01:54:36.479 align:start position:0%
more than 60% of people identifying as
 
01:54:39.870 --> 01:54:39.880 align:start position:0%
Jews Protestants and Catholics support
 
01:54:43.150 --> 01:54:43.160 align:start position:0%
this support Medical Aid in dying I urge
 
01:54:46.510 --> 01:54:46.520 align:start position:0%
you to listen to your constituents More
 
01:54:50.269 --> 01:54:50.279 align:start position:0%
than 70% support Medical Aid in dying
 
01:54:54.510 --> 01:54:54.520 align:start position:0%
only 177% are opposed I urge you to vote
 
01:54:56.670 --> 01:54:56.680 align:start position:0%
this out of committee with strong
 
01:54:59.990 --> 01:55:00.000 align:start position:0%

and at the end of his life I want to
 
01:56:06.389 --> 01:56:06.399 align:start position:0%

between suicide and Medical Aid and
 
01:56:10.670 --> 01:56:10.680 align:start position:0%
dying first legally the death

02:04:33.790 --> 02:04:33.800 align:start position:0%
and I am here in support of this bill
 
02:04:36.670 --> 02:04:36.680 align:start position:0%
I'm completely dishing dissing my um
 
02:04:39.150 --> 02:04:39.160 align:start position:0%
test plan testimony to say the the
 
02:04:42.309 --> 02:04:42.319 align:start position:0%
following first a one of the Physicians
 
02:04:45.590 --> 02:04:45.600 align:start position:0%
who testified um very well I thought was
 
02:04:49.710 --> 02:04:49.720 align:start position:0%
asked um what does do not harm mean and
 
02:04:52.469 --> 02:04:52.479 align:start position:0%
he said allowing people to suffer I am
 
02:04:55.110 --> 02:04:55.120 align:start position:0%
very sure that he and my own physician
 
02:04:58.389 --> 02:04:58.399 align:start position:0%
husband meant not permitting not
 
02:05:01.150 --> 02:05:01.160 align:start position:0%
permitting patients to end their life
 
02:05:02.870 --> 02:05:02.880 align:start position:0%
when they're suffering it's not the
 
02:05:05.469 --> 02:05:05.479 align:start position:0%
doctor's decision it's the
 
02:05:08.429 --> 02:05:08.439 align:start position:0%
patients second there's been an
 
02:05:12.110 --> 02:05:12.120 align:start position:0%
assumption that suicide is evil a bad
 
02:05:16.910 --> 02:05:16.920 align:start position:0%
thing a of course it often is extremely
 
02:05:21.229 --> 02:05:21.239 align:start position:0%
tragic but it can also bring
 
02:05:25.790 --> 02:05:25.800 align:start position:0%
peace suicide for some is a sin it is
 
02:05:29.510 --> 02:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
not a sin for me and for many others sin
 
02:05:32.830 --> 02:05:32.840 align:start position:0%
is a religious concept and under our
 
02:05:35.630 --> 02:05:35.640 align:start position:0%
constitution people's religious beliefs
 
02:05:41.670 --> 02:05:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:45.630 --> 02:05:45.640 align:start position:0%
consideration another Point um several
 
02:05:48.790 --> 02:05:48.800 align:start position:0%
people in opposition have talked about
 
02:05:51.590 --> 02:05:51.600 align:start position:0%
the restrictions that are being lifted
 
02:05:54.309 --> 02:05:54.319 align:start position:0%
in Canada and in the Netherlands and
 
02:05:57.150 --> 02:05:57.160 align:start position:0%
perhaps in other places those are not in
 
02:05:59.389 --> 02:05:59.399 align:start position:0%
this bill and as somebody mentioned they
 
02:06:02.429 --> 02:06:02.439 align:start position:0%
will come back to this group or its
 
02:06:04.830 --> 02:06:04.840 align:start position:0%
representative at that time if these are
 
02:06:07.630 --> 02:06:07.640 align:start position:0%
needed but I would like to point out
 
02:06:10.630 --> 02:06:10.640 align:start position:0%
that those restrictions are not evils
 
02:06:14.030 --> 02:06:14.040 align:start position:0%
perpetuated by politicians or evil
 
02:06:16.389 --> 02:06:16.399 align:start position:0%
people those restrictions are being
 
02:06:19.190 --> 02:06:19.200 align:start position:0%
lifted because
 
02:06:22.630 --> 02:06:22.640 align:start position:0%
individuals want them need them in order
 
02:06:25.389 --> 02:06:25.399 align:start position:0%
to end their suffering it is not in this
 
02:06:28.670 --> 02:06:28.680 align:start position:0%
bill I greatly admire the people who
 
02:06:31.070 --> 02:06:31.080 align:start position:0%
have put this bill forward and and put
 
02:06:34.750 --> 02:06:34.760 align:start position:0%
their thoughts into it but restrictions
 
02:06:34.760 --> 02:06:35.910 align:start position:0%
their thoughts into it but restrictions
being

02:06:35.910 --> 02:06:35.920 align:start position:0%
being
 
02:06:38.990 --> 02:06:39.000 align:start position:0%
removed are is happening because that's
 
02:06:41.870 --> 02:06:41.880 align:start position:0%
what people are demanding all right
 
02:06:43.750 --> 02:06:43.760 align:start position:0%
questions I think you're really over
 
02:06:46.790 --> 02:06:46.800 align:start position:0%
your time ma'am I'm I had one final can
 
02:06:49.389 --> 02:06:49.399 align:start position:0%
I just say one final it's quick just
 
02:06:52.830 --> 02:06:52.840 align:start position:0%
it's quick all right
 
02:06:56.030 --> 02:06:56.040 align:start position:0%
um uh let's see pain first of all
 
02:06:59.349 --> 02:06:59.359 align:start position:0%
painfree is not enough and I that's what
 
02:07:03.229 --> 02:07:03.239 align:start position:0%
the the testimony before it is what it
 
02:07:06.510 --> 02:07:06.520 align:start position:0%
was painfree is not enough it means loss
 
02:07:09.150 --> 02:07:09.160 align:start position:0%
of dignity and all sorts of things
 
02:07:11.550 --> 02:07:11.560 align:start position:0%
people in opposition are wrong if they
 
02:07:14.790 --> 02:07:14.800 align:start position:0%
say that all our ills can be alleviated
 
02:07:18.309 --> 02:07:18.319 align:start position:0%
in other ways they can't be all right
 
02:07:20.190 --> 02:07:20.200 align:start position:0%
thank you very much questions for this
 
02:07:24.950 --> 02:07:24.960 align:start position:0%

testimony and support of House Bill
 
02:08:30.670 --> 02:08:30.680 align:start position:0%
1283 I have never testified like this
 
02:08:33.269 --> 02:08:33.279 align:start position:0%
before but I decided that this bill was
 
02:08:35.229 --> 02:08:35.239 align:start position:0%
so important that I needed to summon the
 
02:08:37.309 --> 02:08:37.319 align:start position:0%
courage to do this
 
02:08:40.670 --> 02:08:40.680 align:start position:0%
today my brother Chuck died from cancer
 
02:08:44.349 --> 02:08:44.359 align:start position:0%
in May of 2022 he lived in in Colorado
 
02:08:47.309 --> 02:08:47.319 align:start position:0%
which is one of the states where um
 
02:08:50.349 --> 02:08:50.359 align:start position:0%
Medical Aid and dying is legal the day
 
02:08:52.190 --> 02:08:52.200 align:start position:0%
after he was diagnosed with his cancer
 
02:08:54.389 --> 02:08:54.399 align:start position:0%
he started a Blog to share his
 
02:08:56.710 --> 02:08:56.720 align:start position:0%
experience with his friends and family
 
02:08:58.550 --> 02:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to read what he wrote that
 
02:08:58.560 --> 02:08:59.349 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to read what he wrote that
first

02:08:59.349 --> 02:08:59.359 align:start position:0%
first
 
02:09:02.030 --> 02:09:02.040 align:start position:0%
Day quote at some point in time this
 
02:09:04.630 --> 02:09:04.640 align:start position:0%
cancer will overwhelm and kill me that's
 
02:09:07.150 --> 02:09:07.160 align:start position:0%
just the way it is however in between
 
02:09:08.990 --> 02:09:09.000 align:start position:0%
then and the Here and Now is a big
 
02:09:11.030 --> 02:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
unknown with respect to the quality of
 
02:09:13.870 --> 02:09:13.880 align:start position:0%
my life I've not been given any hint
 
02:09:15.590 --> 02:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
from these doctors as to what this may
 
02:09:18.429 --> 02:09:18.439 align:start position:0%
be like so I'm glad that Colorado has a
 
02:09:21.469 --> 02:09:21.479 align:start position:0%
death With Dignity law I may never Avail
 
02:09:23.429 --> 02:09:23.439 align:start position:0%
myself of it but there is a certain kind
 
02:09:26.349 --> 02:09:26.359 align:start position:0%
of reassurance in knowing that it is
 
02:09:28.710 --> 02:09:28.720 align:start position:0%
there because this option was available
 
02:09:30.990 --> 02:09:31.000 align:start position:0%
for my brother during the year and a
 
02:09:32.830 --> 02:09:32.840 align:start position:0%
little bit more that he had cancer he
 
02:09:34.670 --> 02:09:34.680 align:start position:0%
had the Peace of Mind knowing that he
 
02:09:37.150 --> 02:09:37.160 align:start position:0%
did have this option and that peace of
 
02:09:39.630 --> 02:09:39.640 align:start position:0%
mind was also with his family and this
 
02:09:41.710 --> 02:09:41.720 align:start position:0%
was a decision that he made that we all
 
02:09:43.870 --> 02:09:43.880 align:start position:0%
fully supported
 
02:09:46.469 --> 02:09:46.479 align:start position:0%
to be clear my brother did not want to
 
02:09:49.110 --> 02:09:49.120 align:start position:0%
die he was diagnosed with cancer when he
 
02:09:51.870 --> 02:09:51.880 align:start position:0%
was 68 he had been living a full life
 
02:09:54.590 --> 02:09:54.600 align:start position:0%
and he still was and in that year that
 
02:09:57.110 --> 02:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
he had cancer he continued to live a
 
02:10:00.030 --> 02:10:00.040 align:start position:0%
full life as best he
 
02:10:02.590 --> 02:10:02.600 align:start position:0%
could he took chemo chemotherapy
 
02:10:04.510 --> 02:10:04.520 align:start position:0%
treatments trying to extend his life as
 
02:10:06.670 --> 02:10:06.680 align:start position:0%
long as he could and that helped him for
 
02:10:08.870 --> 02:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
a year at that point in time they were
 
02:10:11.030 --> 02:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
no longer effective so he stopped taking
 
02:10:13.630 --> 02:10:13.640 align:start position:0%
the chemotherapy treatments and then the
 
02:10:16.030 --> 02:10:16.040 align:start position:0%
cancer grew rapidly and his pain
 
02:10:18.670 --> 02:10:18.680 align:start position:0%
intensified at that point he enrolled in
 
02:10:21.389 --> 02:10:21.399 align:start position:0%
hospice hospice was wonderful and was
 
02:10:24.910 --> 02:10:24.920 align:start position:0%
able to provide medications that helped
 
02:10:28.950 --> 02:10:28.960 align:start position:0%
to diminish his pain but it was never
 
02:10:31.590 --> 02:10:31.600 align:start position:0%
eliminated and his pain increased as his
 
02:10:31.600 --> 02:10:32.590 align:start position:0%
eliminated and his pain increased as his
cancer

02:10:32.590 --> 02:10:32.600 align:start position:0%
cancer
 
02:10:36.190 --> 02:10:36.200 align:start position:0%
grew ultimately he was not able to use
 
02:10:38.190 --> 02:10:38.200 align:start position:0%
uh Medical Aid and dying because he was
 
02:10:41.070 --> 02:10:41.080 align:start position:0%
not able to find the required second
 
02:10:42.469 --> 02:10:42.479 align:start position:0%
doctor that would support the first
 
02:10:42.479 --> 02:10:43.429 align:start position:0%
doctor that would support the first
doctor

02:10:43.429 --> 02:10:43.439 align:start position:0%
doctor
 
02:10:45.830 --> 02:10:45.840 align:start position:0%

minutes I I said good afternoon uh
 
02:11:12.190 --> 02:11:12.200 align:start position:0%
thanks for having me here today I am in
 
02:11:13.950 --> 02:11:13.960 align:start position:0%
favor of this bill there's a couple
 
02:11:15.229 --> 02:11:15.239 align:start position:0%
things I want to talk about and I'll do
 
02:11:17.910 --> 02:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
it quickly um I've heard the people who
 
02:11:19.550 --> 02:11:19.560 align:start position:0%
are against this bill say things like
 
02:11:22.309 --> 02:11:22.319 align:start position:0%
quote their concern is not as the bill
 
02:11:24.670 --> 02:11:24.680 align:start position:0%
is written well if you're not concerned
 
02:11:26.229 --> 02:11:26.239 align:start position:0%
as the bill is written then we shouldn't
 
02:11:26.239 --> 02:11:27.190 align:start position:0%
as the bill is written then we shouldn't
be

02:11:27.190 --> 02:11:27.200 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:11:30.269 --> 02:11:30.279 align:start position:0%
here my concern is it's a slippery slope
 
02:11:31.910 --> 02:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
well if it's a slippery slope we worry
 
02:11:33.590 --> 02:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
about that if the bill were to change
 
02:11:35.590 --> 02:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
not as the bill is written we heard
 
02:11:38.750 --> 02:11:38.760 align:start position:0%
someone say I I the natural progression
 
02:11:40.990 --> 02:11:41.000 align:start position:0%
of the law is blah blah blah I think
 
02:11:43.830 --> 02:11:43.840 align:start position:0%
that's not relevant like look I'm 48
 
02:11:45.950 --> 02:11:45.960 align:start position:0%
years old my wife was diagnosed with
 
02:11:47.950 --> 02:11:47.960 align:start position:0%
cancer at 36 with a newborn a
 
02:11:50.670 --> 02:11:50.680 align:start position:0%
one-year-old and a 5-year-old she passed
 
02:11:54.309 --> 02:11:54.319 align:start position:0%
away in at the age of 42 with a
 
02:11:56.030 --> 02:11:56.040 align:start position:0%
5-year-old a 7-year-old and an
 
02:11:58.710 --> 02:11:58.720 align:start position:0%
11-year-old she did not want to die and
 
02:12:02.830 --> 02:12:02.840 align:start position:0%
leave us okay this was a 5 foot6 135 lb
 
02:12:04.469 --> 02:12:04.479 align:start position:0%
woman who died at
 
02:12:04.479 --> 02:12:06.429 align:start position:0%
woman who died at
85

02:12:06.429 --> 02:12:06.439 align:start position:0%
85
 
02:12:09.910 --> 02:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
lb okay think about what that was for me
 
02:12:13.429 --> 02:12:13.439 align:start position:0%
and the kids as she sat in the maramman
 
02:12:18.030 --> 02:12:18.040 align:start position:0%
house for 10 days asking the doctors why
 
02:12:21.389 --> 02:12:21.399 align:start position:0%
they couldn't help her speed this along
 
02:12:23.349 --> 02:12:23.359 align:start position:0%
with a feeding tube that had been in her
 
02:12:26.750 --> 02:12:26.760 align:start position:0%
stomach for the prior three months she
 
02:12:29.550 --> 02:12:29.560 align:start position:0%
couldn't eat she couldn't drink there
 
02:12:33.630 --> 02:12:33.640 align:start position:0%
was zero chance of her surviving none
 
02:12:36.910 --> 02:12:36.920 align:start position:0%
and she had to sit there begging the
 
02:12:39.710 --> 02:12:39.720 align:start position:0%
doctors to make it go quicker and people
 
02:12:41.269 --> 02:12:41.279 align:start position:0%
behind me are sitting here saying that
 
02:12:43.790 --> 02:12:43.800 align:start position:0%
because the dollar bill says God on it
 
02:12:46.030 --> 02:12:46.040 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't do this that's ridiculous I
 
02:12:47.950 --> 02:12:47.960 align:start position:0%
I'll go to that meeting and say take God
 
02:12:49.309 --> 02:12:49.319 align:start position:0%
off the dollar bill if that's where
 
02:12:51.670 --> 02:12:51.680 align:start position:0%
we're at the reality is nobody should
 
02:12:54.150 --> 02:12:54.160 align:start position:0%
die the way my wife died at
 
02:12:54.160 --> 02:12:55.950 align:start position:0%
die the way my wife died at
85

02:12:55.950 --> 02:12:55.960 align:start position:0%
85
 
02:12:58.349 --> 02:12:58.359 align:start position:0%
pounds all right thank you very much
 
02:13:00.830 --> 02:13:00.840 align:start position:0%
question representative Divine sorry to
 
02:13:02.950 --> 02:13:02.960 align:start position:0%
ask this but when how long ago did this
 
02:13:05.910 --> 02:13:05.920 align:start position:0%
happen she passed away on March 30th
 
02:13:09.110 --> 02:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
2019 thank you for your testimony other
 
02:13:11.670 --> 02:13:11.680 align:start position:0%
questions for this witness seeing none
 
02:13:13.550 --> 02:13:13.560 align:start position:0%
thank you very much sir
 
02:13:16.309 --> 02:13:16.319 align:start position:0%
uh Danielle pimel and the next witness
 
02:13:26.070 --> 02:13:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:29.070 --> 02:13:29.080 align:start position:0%
Gardner good morning my name is Danielle
 
02:13:31.269 --> 02:13:31.279 align:start position:0%
pimel policy council at Americans United
 
02:13:32.870 --> 02:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
for life and today I urge your
 
02:13:35.670 --> 02:13:35.680 align:start position:0%
opposition of this bill the answer and
 
02:13:37.630 --> 02:13:37.640 align:start position:0%
solution to people's hopelessness their
 
02:13:40.269 --> 02:13:40.279 align:start position:0%
despair is not assisted suicide
 
02:13:41.790 --> 02:13:41.800 align:start position:0%
physician assisted suicide is not
 
02:13:43.309 --> 02:13:43.319 align:start position:0%
Healthcare and what it does it actually
 
02:13:45.469 --> 02:13:45.479 align:start position:0%
strips vulnerable persons of authentic
 
02:13:48.110 --> 02:13:48.120 align:start position:0%
Choice near the end of their lives
 
02:13:49.590 --> 02:13:49.600 align:start position:0%
physician assisted suicide promotes
 
02:13:52.269 --> 02:13:52.279 align:start position:0%
ableism it creates a two-tiered system
 
02:13:54.349 --> 02:13:54.359 align:start position:0%
whereby those who are young and vital
 
02:13:55.750 --> 02:13:55.760 align:start position:0%
are given the message of Suicide
 
02:13:57.870 --> 02:13:57.880 align:start position:0%
Prevention but if someone has a serious
 
02:13:59.510 --> 02:13:59.520 align:start position:0%
illness or a disability they're told
 
02:14:01.630 --> 02:14:01.640 align:start position:0%
they should simply end their lives
 
02:14:03.710 --> 02:14:03.720 align:start position:0%
therefore physici assistant suicide uh
 
02:14:06.309 --> 02:14:06.319 align:start position:0%
lethally judges patients quality of life
 
02:14:08.510 --> 02:14:08.520 align:start position:0%
based upon their disability or serious
 
02:14:11.469 --> 02:14:11.479 align:start position:0%
illness which is discriminatory this
 
02:14:14.389 --> 02:14:14.399 align:start position:0%
bill also under cut strong um are strong
 
02:14:16.670 --> 02:14:16.680 align:start position:0%
policies of Suicide Prevention studies
 
02:14:19.110 --> 02:14:19.120 align:start position:0%
show that when a State legalizes
 
02:14:20.950 --> 02:14:20.960 align:start position:0%
physician assisted suicide the rates of
 
02:14:23.190 --> 02:14:23.200 align:start position:0%
nonassisted suicide also increase that
 
02:14:24.590 --> 02:14:24.600 align:start position:0%
means the rates of suicide are
 
02:14:26.750 --> 02:14:26.760 align:start position:0%
increasing in the general
 
02:14:29.990 --> 02:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
population um HB well 1283 would also
 
02:14:31.830 --> 02:14:31.840 align:start position:0%
authorize the use of experimental drugs
 
02:14:33.870 --> 02:14:33.880 align:start position:0%
on patients so these are drugs that have
 
02:14:35.750 --> 02:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
not been FDA approved these are drugs
 
02:14:38.269 --> 02:14:38.279 align:start position:0%
that are compound um drugs these are
 
02:14:40.950 --> 02:14:40.960 align:start position:0%
drugs that have had no oversight no
 
02:14:42.990 --> 02:14:43.000 align:start position:0%
clinical government approved trial
 
02:14:44.550 --> 02:14:44.560 align:start position:0%
and the uh the bill does not require
 
02:14:46.790 --> 02:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
patients to be informed of this so again
 
02:14:48.510 --> 02:14:48.520 align:start position:0%
this raises serious in um informed
 
02:14:50.710 --> 02:14:50.720 align:start position:0%
consent issues for patients um
 
02:14:53.309 --> 02:14:53.319 align:start position:0%
ultimately today the legislature has the
 
02:14:55.110 --> 02:14:55.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity to reject a bill that is
 
02:14:56.710 --> 02:14:56.720 align:start position:0%
discriminatory to stand with those who
 
02:14:58.190 --> 02:14:58.200 align:start position:0%
have disabilities to stand with those
 
02:15:00.349 --> 02:15:00.359 align:start position:0%
who have serious illnesses and to seek
 
02:15:02.229 --> 02:15:02.239 align:start position:0%
opportunities to promote legislation
 
02:15:04.269 --> 02:15:04.279 align:start position:0%
that actually ensures that individuals
 
02:15:05.630 --> 02:15:05.640 align:start position:0%
near the end of their life are treated
 
02:15:07.550 --> 02:15:07.560 align:start position:0%
with dignity and are given proper Health
 
02:15:09.510 --> 02:15:09.520 align:start position:0%
Care thank you so much for your time and
 
02:15:10.910 --> 02:15:10.920 align:start position:0%
I will take any questions you have I
 
02:15:13.309 --> 02:15:13.319 align:start position:0%
also submit written testimony thank you
 
02:15:15.670 --> 02:15:15.680 align:start position:0%
thank you questions for this
 
02:15:18.309 --> 02:15:18.319 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you very much
 
02:15:18.319 --> 02:15:22.349 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you very much
thank

02:15:22.349 --> 02:15:22.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:24.389 --> 02:15:24.399 align:start position:0%
you y no that's fine we'll take
 
02:15:26.750 --> 02:15:26.760 align:start position:0%
absolutely we'll take it thank you thank
 
02:15:29.630 --> 02:15:29.640 align:start position:0%
you very much uh Clarence Gardner and
 
02:15:31.950 --> 02:15:31.960 align:start position:0%
the next witness after that will be
 
02:15:36.070 --> 02:15:36.080 align:start position:0%
Bill Anton uh from North Conway I think
 
02:15:38.950 --> 02:15:38.960 align:start position:0%
I've got that right hello Clarence
 
02:15:41.830 --> 02:15:41.840 align:start position:0%
Gardner from we New Hampshire um I'll
 
02:15:44.189 --> 02:15:44.199 align:start position:0%
submit my written testimony I won't read
 
02:15:47.990 --> 02:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
any of it um I think everything here
 
02:15:50.710 --> 02:15:50.720 align:start position:0%
today comes down to Choice we've heard
 
02:15:53.309 --> 02:15:53.319 align:start position:0%
that word many times from various
 
02:15:56.189 --> 02:15:56.199 align:start position:0%
Witnesses um I forgot to say I'm here in
 
02:16:00.189 --> 02:16:00.199 align:start position:0%
in support of the bill um in fact a a
 
02:16:03.150 --> 02:16:03.160 align:start position:0%
previous witness who was a doctor said
 
02:16:05.269 --> 02:16:05.279 align:start position:0%
he didn't want his choices limited he
 
02:16:07.309 --> 02:16:07.319 align:start position:0%
was talking about what the government
 
02:16:09.710 --> 02:16:09.720 align:start position:0%
allowed him to do but it's not his
 
02:16:12.630 --> 02:16:12.640 align:start position:0%
choice it's the patient's Choice uh
 
02:16:13.950 --> 02:16:13.960 align:start position:0%
that's who we don't want to limit the
 
02:16:17.630 --> 02:16:17.640 align:start position:0%
choices of um the whole purpose of a
 
02:16:20.510 --> 02:16:20.520 align:start position:0%
legislative body is to choose for people
 
02:16:22.870 --> 02:16:22.880 align:start position:0%
hopefully in New Hampshire we try to
 
02:16:25.510 --> 02:16:25.520 align:start position:0%
keep that to a minimum and in fact the
 
02:16:28.790 --> 02:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
the previous uh witness used the word
 
02:16:30.950 --> 02:16:30.960 align:start position:0%
discrimination all legislation is
 
02:16:36.150 --> 02:16:36.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:39.229 --> 02:16:39.239 align:start position:0%
um so yeah that
 
02:16:42.590 --> 02:16:42.600 align:start position:0%
um one example I have in my my testimon
 
02:16:45.110 --> 02:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
is that we all hear stories sometimes
 
02:16:45.120 --> 02:16:47.030 align:start position:0%
is that we all hear stories sometimes
about

02:16:47.030 --> 02:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:16:49.710 --> 02:16:49.720 align:start position:0%
somebody diving into a raging River to
 
02:16:52.469 --> 02:16:52.479 align:start position:0%
save a kid we all applaud him he's
 
02:16:55.469 --> 02:16:55.479 align:start position:0%
heroic it's honorable sometimes he dies
 
02:16:57.550 --> 02:16:57.560 align:start position:0%
sometimes he doesn't but everybody
 
02:17:00.349 --> 02:17:00.359 align:start position:0%
agrees with his choice in that respect
 
02:17:02.510 --> 02:17:02.520 align:start position:0%
but when it comes to the person's choice
 
02:17:04.910 --> 02:17:04.920 align:start position:0%
about his own life no can't do that
 
02:17:07.630 --> 02:17:07.640 align:start position:0%
that's our business we'll decide whether
 
02:17:10.630 --> 02:17:10.640 align:start position:0%
you live or die in fact one editorial I
 
02:17:13.110 --> 02:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
saw that was against the bill
 
02:17:16.070 --> 02:17:16.080 align:start position:0%
actually in so many words said well if
 
02:17:18.830 --> 02:17:18.840 align:start position:0%
you're suffering you just need to man up
 
02:17:20.670 --> 02:17:20.680 align:start position:0%
I I would deal with it you have to deal
 
02:17:22.309 --> 02:17:22.319 align:start position:0%
with it
 
02:17:25.110 --> 02:17:25.120 align:start position:0%
um that's what I that's all I had and I
 
02:17:27.469 --> 02:17:27.479 align:start position:0%
willon point out that uh somebody
 
02:17:29.990 --> 02:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned Live Free or Die we always
 
02:17:31.790 --> 02:17:31.800 align:start position:0%
forget about the second half of that
 
02:17:33.229 --> 02:17:33.239 align:start position:0%
death is not the worst thing that can
 
02:17:35.790 --> 02:17:35.800 align:start position:0%
happen to us sometimes it's the best
 
02:17:38.510 --> 02:17:38.520 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you questions for this
 
02:17:41.630 --> 02:17:41.640 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you very much
 
02:17:42.950 --> 02:17:42.960 align:start position:0%

Conway
 
02:18:13.389 --> 02:18:13.399 align:start position:0%
uh I've been a um hospice volunteer for
 
02:18:16.870 --> 02:18:16.880 align:start position:0%
about 12 years probably more I'm I've
 
02:18:19.710 --> 02:18:19.720 align:start position:0%
been an EMT in New Hampshire licens for
 
02:18:22.670 --> 02:18:22.680 align:start position:0%
40 years I've been involved in Mountain
 
02:18:25.870 --> 02:18:25.880 align:start position:0%
Rescue for probably 50 or 60 years and
 
02:18:28.590 --> 02:18:28.600 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to tell you how old I am
 
02:18:32.269 --> 02:18:32.279 align:start position:0%
however I've seen death in many forms
 
02:18:35.550 --> 02:18:35.560 align:start position:0%
nasty things and quiet things but of all
 
02:18:39.189 --> 02:18:39.199 align:start position:0%
the people that I have seen die from
 
02:18:41.110 --> 02:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
accidents from
 
02:18:44.030 --> 02:18:44.040 align:start position:0%
illnesses people that have got terminal
 
02:18:47.550 --> 02:18:47.560 align:start position:0%
illnesses in in hospice none of them had
 
02:18:47.560 --> 02:18:48.550 align:start position:0%
illnesses in in hospice none of them had
a

02:18:48.550 --> 02:18:48.560 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:18:51.469 --> 02:18:51.479 align:start position:0%
choice I would like to let everybody
 
02:18:53.750 --> 02:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
that's in New Hampshire I would like to
 
02:18:56.670 --> 02:18:56.680 align:start position:0%
see this this bill passed so they have a
 
02:19:00.990 --> 02:19:01.000 align:start position:0%
choice all right just would like to um
 
02:19:03.309 --> 02:19:03.319 align:start position:0%
speak of the importance of this bill in
 
02:19:05.309 --> 02:19:05.319 align:start position:0%
looking after our community members who
 
02:19:08.429 --> 02:19:08.439 align:start position:0%
have been given a terminal diagnosis
 
02:19:11.070 --> 02:19:11.080 align:start position:0%
with no way out it will be interesting
 
02:19:12.550 --> 02:19:12.560 align:start position:0%
to know how many of us
 
02:19:15.590 --> 02:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
have spent time weeks months or so with
 
02:19:18.189 --> 02:19:18.199 align:start position:0%
a hospital P with a hospice patient
 
02:19:20.189 --> 02:19:20.199 align:start position:0%
someone who has nothing to look forward
 
02:19:23.269 --> 02:19:23.279 align:start position:0%
to accept many months of lying in a bed
 
02:19:26.110 --> 02:19:26.120 align:start position:0%
or sitting in a chair unable to go for a
 
02:19:28.750 --> 02:19:28.760 align:start position:0%
walk maybe not even able to go to the
 
02:19:31.189 --> 02:19:31.199 align:start position:0%
bathroom on their own in most cases
 
02:19:33.189 --> 02:19:33.199 align:start position:0%
these people just want to have a
 
02:19:35.630 --> 02:19:35.640 align:start position:0%
peaceful ending to a life that has been
 
02:19:39.830 --> 02:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
well lived I find it very sad that if
 
02:19:42.070 --> 02:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
these good people wish to end their Liv
 
02:19:44.349 --> 02:19:44.359 align:start position:0%
lives peacefully and in their own time
 
02:19:47.510 --> 02:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
they cannot do so in our great state
 
02:19:49.189 --> 02:19:49.199 align:start position:0%
family members could drive them to
 
02:19:52.229 --> 02:19:52.239 align:start position:0%
Vermont or other states that have end of
 
02:19:55.110 --> 02:19:55.120 align:start position:0%
life options but that just doesn't seem
 
02:19:59.189 --> 02:19:59.199 align:start position:0%
like a fair or a kind or a compassionate
 
02:20:01.630 --> 02:20:01.640 align:start position:0%
option to give these good people from
 
02:20:04.189 --> 02:20:04.199 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire all right I think you're
 
02:20:07.510 --> 02:20:07.520 align:start position:0%

30
 
02:20:11.349 --> 02:20:11.359 align:start position:0%
seconds therefore I implore you to
 
02:20:13.349 --> 02:20:13.359 align:start position:0%
support this bill which will enable
 
02:20:16.870 --> 02:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
terminally ill patients in our state to
 
02:20:19.750 --> 02:20:19.760 align:start position:0%
choose to end their lives peacefully and
 
02:20:22.189 --> 02:20:22.199 align:start position:0%
comfortably when they are ready thank
 
02:20:25.229 --> 02:20:25.239 align:start position:0%

02:20:28.269 --> 02:20:28.279 align:start position:0%

02:20:30.950 --> 02:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
Janine Tim house uh Jean Tim house and
 
02:20:40.910 --> 02:20:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:43.670 --> 02:20:43.680 align:start position:0%
Sims and to members of the committee um
 
02:20:45.710 --> 02:20:45.720 align:start position:0%
as you there's as you know there's no
 
02:20:48.790 --> 02:20:48.800 align:start position:0%
requirement for a quorum at uh at these
 
02:20:51.389 --> 02:20:51.399 align:start position:0%
hearings so if people are starting to
 
02:20:53.189 --> 02:20:53.199 align:start position:0%
get hungry I would suggest that we do it
 
02:20:55.590 --> 02:20:55.600 align:start position:0%
in kind of you know not everybody go at
 
02:20:57.790 --> 02:20:57.800 align:start position:0%
once but if somebody wants to take a
 
02:21:00.469 --> 02:21:00.479 align:start position:0%
break to get some lunch that's fine yes
 
02:21:02.070 --> 02:21:02.080 align:start position:0%
please go ahead so I just have to say
 
02:21:04.189 --> 02:21:04.199 align:start position:0%
the last witness took longer because of
 
02:21:07.269 --> 02:21:07.279 align:start position:0%
his British accent that's why he's my
 
02:21:10.750 --> 02:21:10.760 align:start position:0%
husband um my name is Jean twe house um
 
02:21:14.389 --> 02:21:14.399 align:start position:0%
also from North conw and former hospice
 
02:21:18.150 --> 02:21:18.160 align:start position:0%
nurse um have been very disappointed and
 
02:21:21.950 --> 02:21:21.960 align:start position:0%
sad in the past when this bill was voted
 
02:21:25.710 --> 02:21:25.720 align:start position:0%
down um couldn't really understand why
 
02:21:27.389 --> 02:21:27.399 align:start position:0%
um until one day it occurred to me that
 
02:21:30.630 --> 02:21:30.640 align:start position:0%
people just were not seeing what I was
 
02:21:33.870 --> 02:21:33.880 align:start position:0%
seeing people hear about dying assisted
 
02:21:36.990 --> 02:21:37.000 align:start position:0%
dying people don't in most cases don't
 
02:21:39.309 --> 02:21:39.319 align:start position:0%
see death over and over and over again
 
02:21:42.750 --> 02:21:42.760 align:start position:0%
like I did they don't see people who who
 
02:21:44.990 --> 02:21:45.000 align:start position:0%
yes they have their meds yes they have
 
02:21:48.790 --> 02:21:48.800 align:start position:0%
their um symptom kit um they are still
 
02:21:52.469 --> 02:21:52.479 align:start position:0%
in intractable pain they are incontinent
 
02:21:54.469 --> 02:21:54.479 align:start position:0%
they are laying in their own feces and
 
02:21:58.030 --> 02:21:58.040 align:start position:0%
urine until a loved one can come clean
 
02:22:01.349 --> 02:22:01.359 align:start position:0%
them up this goes on for weeks and
 
02:22:05.189 --> 02:22:05.199 align:start position:0%
months it is not a hospice can take care
 
02:22:08.830 --> 02:22:08.840 align:start position:0%
of it hospice cannot do
 
02:22:10.990 --> 02:22:11.000 align:start position:0%
everything we can do a lot but we can't
 
02:22:12.910 --> 02:22:12.920 align:start position:0%
do everything and just to say let
 
02:22:14.830 --> 02:22:14.840 align:start position:0%
hospice let health care take care of it
 
02:22:17.150 --> 02:22:17.160 align:start position:0%
no that doesn't work I have been in so
 
02:22:22.349 --> 02:22:22.359 align:start position:0%
many homes for so many months and people
 
02:22:24.469 --> 02:22:24.479 align:start position:0%
were asking me how much morphine do I
 
02:22:27.150 --> 02:22:27.160 align:start position:0%
need to take I'm sorry I can't tell you
 
02:22:31.670 --> 02:22:31.680 align:start position:0%
that um I've seen mothers ask my son
 
02:22:33.630 --> 02:22:33.640 align:start position:0%
can't keep going through this how much
 
02:22:36.630 --> 02:22:36.640 align:start position:0%
morph do I need to give him if you've
 
02:22:38.950 --> 02:22:38.960 align:start position:0%
never seen that I recommend that you do
 
02:22:41.790 --> 02:22:41.800 align:start position:0%
what Bill did become a hospice volunteer
 
02:22:43.349 --> 02:22:43.359 align:start position:0%
sit with patients sit with their
 
02:22:46.590 --> 02:22:46.600 align:start position:0%
families for hours on end for many days
 
02:22:49.070 --> 02:22:49.080 align:start position:0%
of the week for weeks and months and
 
02:22:52.790 --> 02:22:52.800 align:start position:0%
then tell me how you can say this is not
 
02:22:55.070 --> 02:22:55.080 align:start position:0%
a good thing that we all deserve right
 
02:22:57.870 --> 02:22:57.880 align:start position:0%
thank you questions for this witness
 
02:23:01.429 --> 02:23:01.439 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you uh Rod Sims and
 
02:23:05.150 --> 02:23:05.160 align:start position:0%
the next witness will be Kristen
 
02:23:07.469 --> 02:23:07.479 align:start position:0%
Baker good afternoon Representatives my
 
02:23:10.630 --> 02:23:10.640 align:start position:0%
name is Rod SIM from Belmont uh I do not
 
02:23:13.510 --> 02:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
uh I oppose this bill because in all the
 
02:23:15.870 --> 02:23:15.880 align:start position:0%
countries uh and States this has started
 
02:23:18.389 --> 02:23:18.399 align:start position:0%
out as there's been uh numerous
 
02:23:20.229 --> 02:23:20.239 align:start position:0%
questions that a lot of people became
 
02:23:23.309 --> 02:23:23.319 align:start position:0%
euthanized rather than committed suicide
 
02:23:27.110 --> 02:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
and it's I listened to um Davos the
 
02:23:28.550 --> 02:23:28.560 align:start position:0%
things that was spoken of there that
 
02:23:29.790 --> 02:23:29.800 align:start position:0%
they're saying there's too many people
 
02:23:33.750 --> 02:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
in the world um I've listened to um
 
02:23:35.429 --> 02:23:35.439 align:start position:0%
insurance companies who's wanting to
 
02:23:38.550 --> 02:23:38.560 align:start position:0%
have a a quicker cheaper remedy and I'm
 
02:23:41.710 --> 02:23:41.720 align:start position:0%
afraid that if if this is passed that
 
02:23:45.990 --> 02:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
euthanasia will become more uh common
 
02:23:48.189 --> 02:23:48.199 align:start position:0%
than suicide because insurance companies
 
02:23:49.790 --> 02:23:49.800 align:start position:0%
want to spend less money to take care of
 
02:23:51.710 --> 02:23:51.720 align:start position:0%
us and there's a lot of people in this
 
02:23:53.990 --> 02:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
world that thinks there's too many of us
 
02:23:57.670 --> 02:23:57.680 align:start position:0%
so I've seen a huge change uh since co
 
02:23:59.030 --> 02:23:59.040 align:start position:0%
uh I've been personally threatened in
 
02:24:02.150 --> 02:24:02.160 align:start position:0%
the hospital um because of my my
 
02:24:05.830 --> 02:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
personal beliefs and uh I do not feel
 
02:24:07.710 --> 02:24:07.720 align:start position:0%
secure in having a bill like this pass
 
02:24:09.750 --> 02:24:09.760 align:start position:0%
because I think it will morph into
 
02:24:12.030 --> 02:24:12.040 align:start position:0%
euthanasia my wife sits behind me she's
 
02:24:13.910 --> 02:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
a disabled veteran and I'm very
 
02:24:15.309 --> 02:24:15.319 align:start position:0%
concerned that someday I could take her
 
02:24:17.030 --> 02:24:17.040 align:start position:0%
into the hospital for a checkup and two
 
02:24:19.030 --> 02:24:19.040 align:start position:0%
doctors go into the room come back out
 
02:24:20.349 --> 02:24:20.359 align:start position:0%
and said you can take your wife home and
 
02:24:22.229 --> 02:24:22.239 align:start position:0%
go and find out that they've euthanized
 
02:24:24.990 --> 02:24:25.000 align:start position:0%
her all right questions thank you very
 
02:24:26.590 --> 02:24:26.600 align:start position:0%

02:24:29.269 --> 02:24:29.279 align:start position:0%

divinity in chaplaincy and served as an
 
02:24:51.510 --> 02:24:51.520 align:start position:0%
endof life caregiver for over 5 years
 
02:24:54.550 --> 02:24:54.560 align:start position:0%
often working closely with hospice I was
 
02:24:56.750 --> 02:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
able to see the important impact
 
02:24:59.710 --> 02:24:59.720 align:start position:0%
holistic care provides for those facing
 
02:25:02.070 --> 02:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
death I'm addressing you this morning to
 
02:25:04.110 --> 02:25:04.120 align:start position:0%
oppose the bill
 
02:25:07.110 --> 02:25:07.120 align:start position:0%
1283 there's a psychological and
 
02:25:09.710 --> 02:25:09.720 align:start position:0%
emotional response to a terminal
 
02:25:11.830 --> 02:25:11.840 align:start position:0%
diagnosis that often includ includes
 
02:25:15.950 --> 02:25:15.960 align:start position:0%
ways of shock apathy and despair that it
 
02:25:19.429 --> 02:25:19.439 align:start position:0%
can impair their ability to make vital
 
02:25:21.830 --> 02:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
decisions especially a decision with
 
02:25:25.030 --> 02:25:25.040 align:start position:0%
such fatal consequences how however if
 
02:25:26.950 --> 02:25:26.960 align:start position:0%
the individual is able to work through
 
02:25:29.550 --> 02:25:29.560 align:start position:0%
that crisis they are able to use their
 
02:25:31.550 --> 02:25:31.560 align:start position:0%
remaining time addressing endof life
 
02:25:34.229 --> 02:25:34.239 align:start position:0%
tasks that often prove to be incredibly
 
02:25:37.189 --> 02:25:37.199 align:start position:0%
meaning meaningful for the individual
 
02:25:39.910 --> 02:25:39.920 align:start position:0%
and their loved ones when my mother was
 
02:25:41.830 --> 02:25:41.840 align:start position:0%
diagnosed with terminal cancer she
 
02:25:44.030 --> 02:25:44.040 align:start position:0%
endured ways of emotional turmoil that
 
02:25:46.950 --> 02:25:46.960 align:start position:0%
Her diagnosis in
 
02:25:49.429 --> 02:25:49.439 align:start position:0%
inspired by fighting through those ways
 
02:25:51.670 --> 02:25:51.680 align:start position:0%
of depression fear and pain she was able
 
02:25:53.870 --> 02:25:53.880 align:start position:0%
to use her remaining time accomplishing
 
02:25:55.950 --> 02:25:55.960 align:start position:0%
tasks and goals that added to her
 
02:25:59.830 --> 02:25:59.840 align:start position:0%
lasting Legacy more important to me and
 
02:26:02.269 --> 02:26:02.279 align:start position:0%
those who knew her time spent with her
 
02:26:04.550 --> 02:26:04.560 align:start position:0%
during her final M months was a
 
02:26:07.790 --> 02:26:07.800 align:start position:0%
Priceless gift one my children my
 
02:26:10.990 --> 02:26:11.000 align:start position:0%
husband and I will cherish so my serious
 
02:26:13.070 --> 02:26:13.080 align:start position:0%
concern with this bill is that patients
 
02:26:15.269 --> 02:26:15.279 align:start position:0%
will make an emotional decision In The
 
02:26:17.750 --> 02:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
Heat Of Crisis and pain that will steal
 
02:26:19.790 --> 02:26:19.800 align:start position:0%
from them and their loved ones the
 
02:26:22.389 --> 02:26:22.399 align:start position:0%
possibilities that remaining moments and
 
02:26:26.349 --> 02:26:26.359 align:start position:0%
days or even weeks might hold thank you
 
02:26:29.229 --> 02:26:29.239 align:start position:0%

at age 12 in the early 90s I was
 
02:27:18.990 --> 02:27:19.000 align:start position:0%
diagnosed with my first chronic
 
02:27:22.710 --> 02:27:22.720 align:start position:0%
illness by the time I was 20 years old
 
02:27:26.030 --> 02:27:26.040 align:start position:0%
um the disease had taken over so much of
 
02:27:29.550 --> 02:27:29.560 align:start position:0%
of of who I was that I was questioning
 
02:27:32.670 --> 02:27:32.680 align:start position:0%
life and at that time there wasn't much
 
02:27:35.670 --> 02:27:35.680 align:start position:0%
U medicine that was available to me the
 
02:27:38.389 --> 02:27:38.399 align:start position:0%
doctors were at that time even hinting
 
02:27:41.349 --> 02:27:41.359 align:start position:0%
to um it would be better if I would be
 
02:27:41.359 --> 02:27:42.550 align:start position:0%
to um it would be better if I would be
be

02:27:42.550 --> 02:27:42.560 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:27:46.070 --> 02:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
dead a year later I met the love of my
 
02:27:49.070 --> 02:27:49.080 align:start position:0%
life who Christian whom you just heard
 
02:27:51.550 --> 02:27:51.560 align:start position:0%
and together we've had two
 
02:27:54.189 --> 02:27:54.199 align:start position:0%
children and it's only because of the
 
02:27:55.910 --> 02:27:55.920 align:start position:0%
hope that I was able to have in the
 
02:27:58.550 --> 02:27:58.560 align:start position:0%
midst of fighting these
 
02:28:02.229 --> 02:28:02.239 align:start position:0%
illnesses that I choose I chose to
 
02:28:04.990 --> 02:28:05.000 align:start position:0%
continue to live and move forward you
 
02:28:07.309 --> 02:28:07.319 align:start position:0%
see I believe that hope makes a
 
02:28:09.349 --> 02:28:09.359 align:start position:0%
difference and when you have been told
 
02:28:11.269 --> 02:28:11.279 align:start position:0%
that you've been given 3 to six months
 
02:28:13.309 --> 02:28:13.319 align:start position:0%
to live that your body immediately
 
02:28:15.630 --> 02:28:15.640 align:start position:0%
starts to react based off of the hope
 
02:28:18.630 --> 02:28:18.640 align:start position:0%
that you have or do not have I watched
 
02:28:21.030 --> 02:28:21.040 align:start position:0%
my mother-in-law be given 3 to six
 
02:28:24.429 --> 02:28:24.439 align:start position:0%
months to live and yet defied those odds
 
02:28:28.389 --> 02:28:28.399 align:start position:0%
and lived another 11
 
02:28:31.990 --> 02:28:32.000 align:start position:0%
years because she had hope because she
 
02:28:34.950 --> 02:28:34.960 align:start position:0%
had faith and I truly do believe that
 
02:28:36.189 --> 02:28:36.199 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we need to
 
02:28:39.150 --> 02:28:39.160 align:start position:0%
concentrate the most on in this in this
 
02:28:41.389 --> 02:28:41.399 align:start position:0%
bill is really the mental health side of
 
02:28:44.030 --> 02:28:44.040 align:start position:0%
it that if we can provide the support
 
02:28:46.469 --> 02:28:46.479 align:start position:0%
that's needed to these patients who have
 
02:28:49.469 --> 02:28:49.479 align:start position:0%
terminal illnesses that that will make
 
02:28:51.870 --> 02:28:51.880 align:start position:0%
the most of the difference providing
 
02:28:55.630 --> 02:28:55.640 align:start position:0%
hope for them to continue to fight to
 
02:28:57.550 --> 02:28:57.560 align:start position:0%
allow their loved ones to be able to see
 
02:28:59.229 --> 02:28:59.239 align:start position:0%
them live the full
 
02:29:02.030 --> 02:29:02.040 align:start position:0%
life that somebody else may have had
 
02:29:04.269 --> 02:29:04.279 align:start position:0%
planned for them all right thank you
 
02:29:06.550 --> 02:29:06.560 align:start position:0%
very much questions for this witness
 
02:29:09.389 --> 02:29:09.399 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you Dennis Pratt and
 
02:29:15.150 --> 02:29:15.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:18.070 --> 02:29:18.080 align:start position:0%
Reed hello I'm Dennis Pratt I'm from
 
02:29:21.630 --> 02:29:21.640 align:start position:0%
Dover um so two minutes uh let's let's
 
02:29:24.229 --> 02:29:24.239 align:start position:0%
think about this about 20 years from now
 
02:29:26.550 --> 02:29:26.560 align:start position:0%
we've uh in New Hampshire we've removed
 
02:29:28.670 --> 02:29:28.680 align:start position:0%
all the victimless crimes but only if
 
02:29:31.070 --> 02:29:31.080 align:start position:0%
you're almost dead so if you're almost
 
02:29:33.269 --> 02:29:33.279 align:start position:0%
dead you can smoke a joint you can have
 
02:29:36.670 --> 02:29:36.680 align:start position:0%
a full flow shower if you want um and
 
02:29:39.590 --> 02:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
you can pick up some medicine that might
 
02:29:41.269 --> 02:29:41.279 align:start position:0%
that that you could actually hold back
 
02:29:43.830 --> 02:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
and you might want to injust if your
 
02:29:46.590 --> 02:29:46.600 align:start position:0%
death becomes torturous if it becomes
 
02:29:50.309 --> 02:29:50.319 align:start position:0%
too painful and you can instead die
 
02:29:54.110 --> 02:29:54.120 align:start position:0%
easily in your sleep without pain in the
 
02:29:56.870 --> 02:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
arms of your family but somebody doesn't
 
02:30:00.429 --> 02:30:00.439 align:start position:0%
like this bill so they they they they
 
02:30:02.870 --> 02:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
they they they introduce a new bill they
 
02:30:04.630 --> 02:30:04.640 align:start position:0%
introduce a bill that says we should
 
02:30:07.309 --> 02:30:07.319 align:start position:0%
take away this right of the almost dying
 
02:30:09.590 --> 02:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
Granite Stater and they bring in
 
02:30:11.710 --> 02:30:11.720 align:start position:0%
hundreds of people who say I don't like
 
02:30:14.150 --> 02:30:14.160 align:start position:0%
this option this is a terrible option
 
02:30:15.790 --> 02:30:15.800 align:start position:0%
and the Judiciary Committee listens to
 
02:30:17.750 --> 02:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
this and they say well you know you
 
02:30:20.150 --> 02:30:20.160 align:start position:0%
don't actually have to take the option
 
02:30:21.670 --> 02:30:21.680 align:start position:0%
it's just an
 
02:30:23.750 --> 02:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
option and so a bunch of healthcare
 
02:30:26.269 --> 02:30:26.279 align:start position:0%
workers come in and say our healthc care
 
02:30:29.150 --> 02:30:29.160 align:start position:0%
is just so fantastic nobody needs
 
02:30:31.790 --> 02:30:31.800 align:start position:0%
another alternative to this we have no
 
02:30:33.030 --> 02:30:33.040 align:start position:0%
need for
 
02:30:38.070 --> 02:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
it no one well almost no one very few
 
02:30:42.110 --> 02:30:42.120 align:start position:0%
people die with devastating pain
 
02:30:43.670 --> 02:30:43.680 align:start position:0%
and of course the wise Judiciary
 
02:30:45.510 --> 02:30:45.520 align:start position:0%
Committee says well you know I'm I'm I'm
 
02:30:47.870 --> 02:30:47.880 align:start position:0%
very glad that that you're proud of this
 
02:30:49.429 --> 02:30:49.439 align:start position:0%
great service that you
 
02:30:52.469 --> 02:30:52.479 align:start position:0%
provide but you know we actually want to
 
02:30:55.070 --> 02:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
support here consumer choice we want
 
02:30:57.070 --> 02:30:57.080 align:start position:0%
some sort of competition allow people to
 
02:30:58.790 --> 02:30:58.800 align:start position:0%
make their own own
 
02:31:01.030 --> 02:31:01.040 align:start position:0%
decisions and finally one person says
 
02:31:03.950 --> 02:31:03.960 align:start position:0%
well hey look when people are dying
 
02:31:03.960 --> 02:31:05.110 align:start position:0%
well hey look when people are dying
they're

02:31:05.110 --> 02:31:05.120 align:start position:0%
they're
 
02:31:08.910 --> 02:31:08.920 align:start position:0%
dumb they are in pain they can't think
 
02:31:11.670 --> 02:31:11.680 align:start position:0%
well they're too emotional
 
02:31:14.189 --> 02:31:14.199 align:start position:0%
I can think better than they can think
 
02:31:17.309 --> 02:31:17.319 align:start position:0%
and I'm deciding that they ought to die
 
02:31:19.750 --> 02:31:19.760 align:start position:0%
not as they choose but they should die
 
02:31:22.990 --> 02:31:23.000 align:start position:0%
um uh uh through starvation or
 
02:31:25.710 --> 02:31:25.720 align:start position:0%
dehydration or whatever it is you're
 
02:31:27.670 --> 02:31:27.680 align:start position:0%
kind of over your time sir so I can ask
 
02:31:31.110 --> 02:31:31.120 align:start position:0%
ask you to sum up please sure
 
02:31:35.110 --> 02:31:35.120 align:start position:0%
um so I'm hoping that this Judiciary
 
02:31:38.269 --> 02:31:38.279 align:start position:0%
Committee will today hold off on that
 
02:31:42.630 --> 02:31:42.640 align:start position:0%
future and allow us to say let say we
 
02:31:46.349 --> 02:31:46.359 align:start position:0%
want to give granted Staters the right
 
02:31:50.870 --> 02:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
to live free and to Die free as free men
 
02:31:53.269 --> 02:31:53.279 align:start position:0%
thank you questions for this witness
 
02:31:56.630 --> 02:31:56.640 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you Douglas Reed and
 
02:32:07.189 --> 02:32:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:09.870 --> 02:32:09.880 align:start position:0%
lean good afternoon
 
02:32:12.630 --> 02:32:12.640 align:start position:0%
everyone my name is Doug Reed I'm here
 
02:32:15.429 --> 02:32:15.439 align:start position:0%
in supportive end of life options act I
 
02:32:17.189 --> 02:32:17.199 align:start position:0%
was born and raised in New Hampshire and
 
02:32:18.389 --> 02:32:18.399 align:start position:0%
currently live in
 
02:32:21.349 --> 02:32:21.359 align:start position:0%
Raymond my motivation today for speaking
 
02:32:23.710 --> 02:32:23.720 align:start position:0%
today is like everyone else in this room
 
02:32:26.389 --> 02:32:26.399 align:start position:0%
I'm going to die someday death is a
 
02:32:28.630 --> 02:32:28.640 align:start position:0%
topic very few of us want to think about
 
02:32:30.309 --> 02:32:30.319 align:start position:0%
or discuss especially when associated
 
02:32:31.550 --> 02:32:31.560 align:start position:0%
with our own
 
02:32:33.510 --> 02:32:33.520 align:start position:0%
mortality disregard your personal
 
02:32:35.309 --> 02:32:35.319 align:start position:0%
beliefs on the morality of Medical Aid
 
02:32:36.830 --> 02:32:36.840 align:start position:0%
and dying for a moment and think about
 
02:32:38.269 --> 02:32:38.279 align:start position:0%
what your idea of a dignified death
 
02:32:40.229 --> 02:32:40.239 align:start position:0%
means to you if you were diagnosed with
 
02:32:43.349 --> 02:32:43.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:45.189 --> 02:32:45.199 align:start position:0%
some would argue hospice exist to
 
02:32:46.910 --> 02:32:46.920 align:start position:0%
fulfill the wishes of a dying person so
 
02:32:49.630 --> 02:32:49.640 align:start position:0%
why do we need Medical Aid in dying yes
 
02:32:51.550 --> 02:32:51.560 align:start position:0%
hospice provides an amazing service DET
 
02:32:53.590 --> 02:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
terminally ill people however the dying
 
02:32:55.269 --> 02:32:55.279 align:start position:0%
process may not necessarily be quick
 
02:32:57.870 --> 02:32:57.880 align:start position:0%
painless or symptom
 
02:33:00.229 --> 02:33:00.239 align:start position:0%
free when the disease in controlling
 
02:33:01.790 --> 02:33:01.800 align:start position:0%
your body and mind when you've lost
 
02:33:03.429 --> 02:33:03.439 align:start position:0%
pleasure in the things you once loved
 
02:33:04.870 --> 02:33:04.880 align:start position:0%
when you're in pain when you're
 
02:33:06.469 --> 02:33:06.479 align:start position:0%
suffering and you fear burdening those
 
02:33:08.269 --> 02:33:08.279 align:start position:0%
around you there's nothing more to do
 
02:33:10.030 --> 02:33:10.040 align:start position:0%
but wait for death having the power to
 
02:33:12.630 --> 02:33:12.640 align:start position:0%
take or or not take life-ending drugs
 
02:33:14.349 --> 02:33:14.359 align:start position:0%
can be a supreme Comfort to so many
 
02:33:16.710 --> 02:33:16.720 align:start position:0%
people we've heard that a lot tonight
 
02:33:16.720 --> 02:33:18.550 align:start position:0%

02:33:20.950 --> 02:33:20.960 align:start position:0%
um and it's time for New Hampshire to
 
02:33:24.110 --> 02:33:24.120 align:start position:0%
provide a painful uh sorry peaceful
 
02:33:25.630 --> 02:33:25.640 align:start position:0%
painfree life-ending option for
 
02:33:28.389 --> 02:33:28.399 align:start position:0%
terminally ill patients I know that's
 
02:33:30.590 --> 02:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
something I'd like to have available to
 
02:33:33.229 --> 02:33:33.239 align:start position:0%

02:33:35.269 --> 02:33:35.279 align:start position:0%
question but um I I would love to have

02:34:15.550 --> 02:34:15.560 align:start position:0%
months ago using a program similar to
 
02:34:18.269 --> 02:34:18.279 align:start position:0%
the one being proposed here in New
 
02:34:20.830 --> 02:34:20.840 align:start position:0%

pancreatic cancer in 2018 he was given a

02:34:36.630 --> 02:34:36.640 align:start position:0%
he was able to choose it and no one
 
02:34:38.630 --> 02:34:38.640 align:start position:0%
forced him into it he was offered all
 
02:34:41.469 --> 02:34:41.479 align:start position:0%
the health care that he needed did until
 
02:34:43.710 --> 02:34:43.720 align:start position:0%
he decided he was
 
02:34:46.110 --> 02:34:46.120 align:start position:0%
done my sister and I were able to read
 
02:34:48.990 --> 02:34:49.000 align:start position:0%
eulogies to our eulogies to him before
 
02:34:52.870 --> 02:34:52.880 align:start position:0%
he passed he was uh aware and he got to
 
02:34:54.030 --> 02:34:54.040 align:start position:0%
express his
 
02:34:57.229 --> 02:34:57.239 align:start position:0%
gratitude and it was peaceful he died
 
02:35:01.830 --> 02:35:01.840 align:start position:0%
with a smile on his face um he was so
 
02:35:05.870 --> 02:35:05.880 align:start position:0%
brave I watched him die I held his hand
 
02:35:07.790 --> 02:35:07.800 align:start position:0%
it took a lot of Courage for him to do
 
02:35:09.590 --> 02:35:09.600 align:start position:0%
that I'm not sure if I could make that
 
02:35:12.630 --> 02:35:12.640 align:start position:0%
choice myself but I want that choice for
 
02:35:15.269 --> 02:35:15.279 align:start position:0%
myself and for the other people in New
 
02:35:17.469 --> 02:35:17.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I call it a complicated
 
02:35:22.910 --> 02:35:22.920 align:start position:0%
blessing in a way um it's not easy um
 
02:35:26.710 --> 02:35:26.720 align:start position:0%
but Health Care includes death care and
 
02:35:28.229 --> 02:35:28.239 align:start position:0%
I think this is an important part of
 
02:35:30.429 --> 02:35:30.439 align:start position:0%
that we use a lot of technology to keep
 
02:35:32.750 --> 02:35:32.760 align:start position:0%
people alive for much longer than
 
02:35:35.269 --> 02:35:35.279 align:start position:0%
perhaps nature intended and I think this
 
02:35:37.150 --> 02:35:37.160 align:start position:0%
technology is just one tool in the
 
02:35:39.150 --> 02:35:39.160 align:start position:0%
toolbox as others have said thank you
 
02:35:41.590 --> 02:35:41.600 align:start position:0%
very much thank you questions for this
 
02:35:43.910 --> 02:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
witness yes representative Perez thank
 
02:35:45.309 --> 02:35:45.319 align:start position:0%
you thanks for taking my question your
 
02:35:48.070 --> 02:35:48.080 align:start position:0%
father was diagnosed in 2018 that's
 
02:35:49.870 --> 02:35:49.880 align:start position:0%
correct was he
 
02:35:53.070 --> 02:35:53.080 align:start position:0%
given a life expectancy at that time I
 
02:35:54.750 --> 02:35:54.760 align:start position:0%
think with pancreatic cancer they very
 
02:35:56.910 --> 02:35:56.920 align:start position:0%
often do people often go quickly with
 
02:35:58.750 --> 02:35:58.760 align:start position:0%
pancreatic cancer he was given a year to
 
02:36:01.389 --> 02:36:01.399 align:start position:0%
18 months and he really defied the odds
 
02:36:04.790 --> 02:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
so if he had chosen this option at six
 
02:36:06.830 --> 02:36:06.840 align:start position:0%
months he would have
 
02:36:09.510 --> 02:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
lost five years with you
 
02:36:12.590 --> 02:36:12.600 align:start position:0%
all I think that from what I've observed
 
02:36:16.429 --> 02:36:16.439 align:start position:0%
and you know he he only chose this
 
02:36:18.990 --> 02:36:19.000 align:start position:0%
option four and a half years after he
 
02:36:20.910 --> 02:36:20.920 align:start position:0%
was diagnosed I understand that but had
 
02:36:23.389 --> 02:36:23.399 align:start position:0%
it been around and he chose it when he
 
02:36:27.670 --> 02:36:27.680 align:start position:0%
was diagnosed he would have lost those
 
02:36:30.150 --> 02:36:30.160 align:start position:0%
years with you all I I understand your
 
02:36:31.670 --> 02:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
question I think that there's an
 
02:36:33.830 --> 02:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
assumption that when someone receives a
 
02:36:36.550 --> 02:36:36.560 align:start position:0%
prognosis okay often doctors do will
 
02:36:37.830 --> 02:36:37.840 align:start position:0%
give prognosis and they're very
 
02:36:40.510 --> 02:36:40.520 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable giving prognoses because
 
02:36:42.389 --> 02:36:42.399 align:start position:0%
it's really unknown how long a person
 
02:36:44.309 --> 02:36:44.319 align:start position:0%
will live so it really is up to the
 
02:36:46.750 --> 02:36:46.760 align:start position:0%
patient and I think that in my father's
 
02:36:49.269 --> 02:36:49.279 align:start position:0%
case he waited until he really couldn't
 
02:36:51.150 --> 02:36:51.160 align:start position:0%
anymore and then he had that option
 
02:36:51.160 --> 02:36:51.830 align:start position:0%
anymore and then he had that option
thank

02:36:51.830 --> 02:36:51.840 align:start position:0%
thank
 
02:36:54.389 --> 02:36:54.399 align:start position:0%

the microphone thank you thank youa Alid
 
02:37:27.590 --> 02:37:27.600 align:start position:0%
and I'm here today to speak um solely as
 
02:37:31.030 --> 02:37:31.040 align:start position:0%
a nurse based on my 45 year practice um
 
02:37:33.630 --> 02:37:33.640 align:start position:0%
and of clinical practice 30 years of
 
02:37:35.269 --> 02:37:35.279 align:start position:0%
which have been in the operating room
 
02:37:37.670 --> 02:37:37.680 align:start position:0%
and 15 years in
 
02:37:40.550 --> 02:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
oncology um pain management and and
 
02:37:40.560 --> 02:37:42.269 align:start position:0%
oncology um pain management and and
integrative

02:37:42.269 --> 02:37:42.279 align:start position:0%
integrative
 
02:37:45.910 --> 02:37:45.920 align:start position:0%
care I am a strong um Advocate and
 
02:37:49.150 --> 02:37:49.160 align:start position:0%
supporter of this bill
 
02:37:53.189 --> 02:37:53.199 align:start position:0%
1283 I feel that it clearly
 
02:37:56.110 --> 02:37:56.120 align:start position:0%
defines um very specific qualifications
 
02:37:59.510 --> 02:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
of eligibility for someone to um have
 
02:38:04.110 --> 02:38:04.120 align:start position:0%
this option and it also speaks to
 
02:38:04.120 --> 02:38:05.670 align:start position:0%
this option and it also speaks to
um

02:38:05.670 --> 02:38:05.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:38:09.110 --> 02:38:09.120 align:start position:0%
the AL of speaking of really identifying
 
02:38:12.189 --> 02:38:12.199 align:start position:0%
us as citizens of New Hampshire as
 
02:38:14.990 --> 02:38:15.000 align:start position:0%
individuals and having a right to choose
 
02:38:16.830 --> 02:38:16.840 align:start position:0%
I mean you've heard many stories today
 
02:38:19.630 --> 02:38:19.640 align:start position:0%
of people's experiences I have many
 
02:38:23.510 --> 02:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
myself but as a nurse as a nurse really
 
02:38:25.590 --> 02:38:25.600 align:start position:0%
a symbol is of
 
02:38:28.429 --> 02:38:28.439 align:start position:0%
compassion strong uh protector of a
 
02:38:31.510 --> 02:38:31.520 align:start position:0%
patient's privacy dignity and
 
02:38:34.630 --> 02:38:34.640 align:start position:0%
autonomy and to deliver compassion of
 
02:38:38.349 --> 02:38:38.359 align:start position:0%
care which we do I um it's very
 
02:38:40.910 --> 02:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
gut-wrenching in many situations and and
 
02:38:42.269 --> 02:38:42.279 align:start position:0%
it does seem
 
02:38:44.670 --> 02:38:44.680 align:start position:0%
inhumane I think that the passing of
 
02:38:44.680 --> 02:38:46.389 align:start position:0%
inhumane I think that the passing of
this

02:38:46.389 --> 02:38:46.399 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:38:49.110 --> 02:38:49.120 align:start position:0%
legislation would provide options as it
 
02:38:51.750 --> 02:38:51.760 align:start position:0%
was eloquently stated earlier just to
 
02:38:54.269 --> 02:38:54.279 align:start position:0%
know the option is there is a comfort
 
02:38:56.550 --> 02:38:56.560 align:start position:0%
whether you choose to Avail yourself of
 
02:39:00.750 --> 02:39:00.760 align:start position:0%
that and also um it's a very
 
02:39:03.950 --> 02:39:03.960 align:start position:0%
Humane dignified choice for a patient to
 
02:39:07.269 --> 02:39:07.279 align:start position:0%
suffer for not to have to suffer so I
 
02:39:09.950 --> 02:39:09.960 align:start position:0%
strongly support the passing of that
 
02:39:12.590 --> 02:39:12.600 align:start position:0%
thank you questions for this witness
 
02:39:17.150 --> 02:39:17.160 align:start position:0%
seeing none Peter Hogan uh and next will
 
02:39:32.309 --> 02:39:32.319 align:start position:0%

McManaman thank you honorable chairman

me
 
02:39:41.389 --> 02:39:41.399 align:start position:0%
speak House Bill 1283 seeks to make
 
02:39:43.189 --> 02:39:43.199 align:start position:0%
life-ending medication available to
 
02:39:45.630 --> 02:39:45.640 align:start position:0%
adults with a terminal
 
02:39:48.429 --> 02:39:48.439 align:start position:0%
illness if this bill is made into law
 
02:39:50.269 --> 02:39:50.279 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire will be taking its first
 
02:39:52.670 --> 02:39:52.680 align:start position:0%
steps towards normalizing
 
02:39:55.790 --> 02:39:55.800 align:start position:0%
suicide this normalization of suicide
 
02:39:57.550 --> 02:39:57.560 align:start position:0%
would be crippling for teens in New
 
02:40:00.110 --> 02:40:00.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in New Hampshire alone a
 
02:40:02.229 --> 02:40:02.239 align:start position:0%
quarter of Youth have considered
 
02:40:05.950 --> 02:40:05.960 align:start position:0%
attempting suicide 19% of Youth have
 
02:40:09.150 --> 02:40:09.160 align:start position:0%
even made suicide plans and almost 10%
 
02:40:11.790 --> 02:40:11.800 align:start position:0%
have attempted suicide at least
 
02:40:14.110 --> 02:40:14.120 align:start position:0%
once if teams with depression and
 
02:40:16.630 --> 02:40:16.640 align:start position:0%
Suicidal Thoughts start seeing family
 
02:40:18.510 --> 02:40:18.520 align:start position:0%
members and friends or relatives of
 
02:40:20.349 --> 02:40:20.359 align:start position:0%
friends committing suicide with the use
 
02:40:23.469 --> 02:40:23.479 align:start position:0%
of these pills and they see that this is
 
02:40:25.710 --> 02:40:25.720 align:start position:0%
being morally accepted by the people
 
02:40:28.189 --> 02:40:28.199 align:start position:0%
around them they will see no issue with
 
02:40:31.670 --> 02:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
attempting suicide or or in encouraging
 
02:40:34.630 --> 02:40:34.640 align:start position:0%
friends to attempt suicide this bill
 
02:40:37.269 --> 02:40:37.279 align:start position:0%
will start to deteriorate deteriorate
 
02:40:39.630 --> 02:40:39.640 align:start position:0%
the moral compass of Youth and adults
 
02:40:42.389 --> 02:40:42.399 align:start position:0%
alike in New Hampshire I have friends
 
02:40:44.710 --> 02:40:44.720 align:start position:0%
who if this Bill had already been put
 
02:40:48.189 --> 02:40:48.199 align:start position:0%
into law would not be here friends who
 
02:40:48.199 --> 02:40:49.550 align:start position:0%
into law would not be here friends who
have

02:40:49.550 --> 02:40:49.560 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:40:52.389 --> 02:40:52.399 align:start position:0%
seen friends who would have seen the use
 
02:40:55.110 --> 02:40:55.120 align:start position:0%
of this medical suicide as something
 
02:40:57.309 --> 02:40:57.319 align:start position:0%
acceptable and would not have seen any
 
02:40:58.950 --> 02:40:58.960 align:start position:0%
difference if they just ended their
 
02:41:01.229 --> 02:41:01.239 align:start position:0%
suffering by killing
 
02:41:04.349 --> 02:41:04.359 align:start position:0%
themselves I ask you to oppose this bill
 
02:41:06.510 --> 02:41:06.520 align:start position:0%
in order to uphold the Dignity of human
 
02:41:08.630 --> 02:41:08.640 align:start position:0%
life and to help preserve the moral
 
02:41:10.870 --> 02:41:10.880 align:start position:0%

to oppose hb1
 
02:41:54.630 --> 02:41:54.640 align:start position:0%
1283 I'd like to begin by saying that
 
02:41:56.750 --> 02:41:56.760 align:start position:0%
this bill is designed to give a person
 
02:41:59.670 --> 02:41:59.680 align:start position:0%
who is suffering the option to end their
 
02:42:02.590 --> 02:42:02.600 align:start position:0%
own life in order to end their suffering
 
02:42:04.790 --> 02:42:04.800 align:start position:0%
by the administration of a lethal
 
02:42:07.750 --> 02:42:07.760 align:start position:0%
substance one of the main issues at hand
 
02:42:09.590 --> 02:42:09.600 align:start position:0%
which has caused the proposed bill is
 
02:42:12.189 --> 02:42:12.199 align:start position:0%
the problem of patients who are in
 
02:42:14.309 --> 02:42:14.319 align:start position:0%
severe pain without access to pain
 
02:42:17.870 --> 02:42:17.880 align:start position:0%
relief through either hospice or palea
 
02:42:21.910 --> 02:42:21.920 align:start position:0%
care this is a real problem and the
 
02:42:26.349 --> 02:42:26.359 align:start position:0%
solution to this problem should be to
 
02:42:28.590 --> 02:42:28.600 align:start position:0%
improve the hospice and palea of care
 
02:42:30.830 --> 02:42:30.840 align:start position:0%
industry and its
 
02:42:33.710 --> 02:42:33.720 align:start position:0%
accessibility or other Alternatives but
 
02:42:37.830 --> 02:42:37.840 align:start position:0%
not to legalize physician assisted
 
02:42:40.269 --> 02:42:40.279 align:start position:0%
suicide because to legalize this would
 
02:42:42.429 --> 02:42:42.439 align:start position:0%
bring more problems and
 
02:42:45.389 --> 02:42:45.399 align:start position:0%
solutions the truth is that every human
 
02:42:47.550 --> 02:42:47.560 align:start position:0%
being is incredibly capable of finding
 
02:42:50.469 --> 02:42:50.479 align:start position:0%
meaning in life therefore every life is
 
02:42:54.030 --> 02:42:54.040 align:start position:0%
worth living even at the hardest times
 
02:42:56.070 --> 02:42:56.080 align:start position:0%
our health care System should embody
 
02:42:59.429 --> 02:42:59.439 align:start position:0%
this statement by striving to save lives
 
02:43:01.429 --> 02:43:01.439 align:start position:0%
ensure an honorable death when it
 
02:43:04.189 --> 02:43:04.199 align:start position:0%
naturally occurs and embrace hope even
 
02:43:06.469 --> 02:43:06.479 align:start position:0%
in the most difficult
 
02:43:08.870 --> 02:43:08.880 align:start position:0%
cases I would like to explain a couple
 
02:43:11.550 --> 02:43:11.560 align:start position:0%
issues PA s brings to New
 
02:43:14.870 --> 02:43:14.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire first it promotes a lie which
 
02:43:16.750 --> 02:43:16.760 align:start position:0%
forsakes the idea that life is
 
02:43:19.269 --> 02:43:19.279 align:start position:0%
inherently valuable and all people can
 
02:43:22.389 --> 02:43:22.399 align:start position:0%
find happiness and it reduces a person's
 
02:43:23.870 --> 02:43:23.880 align:start position:0%
life to
 
02:43:26.830 --> 02:43:26.840 align:start position:0%
hopelessness death by Pas would not be
 
02:43:29.950 --> 02:43:29.960 align:start position:0%
death With Dignity but it would be more
 
02:43:34.389 --> 02:43:34.399 align:start position:0%
so a life with no more meaning put to an
 
02:43:38.590 --> 02:43:38.600 align:start position:0%
end however no human life is meaningless
 
02:43:40.710 --> 02:43:40.720 align:start position:0%
you're you're at the end of your time so
 
02:43:42.910 --> 02:43:42.920 align:start position:0%
can I ask you to sum up please yes
 
02:43:45.630 --> 02:43:45.640 align:start position:0%
therefore no life should be put to an
 
02:43:49.950 --> 02:43:49.960 align:start position:0%
end uh I would just like to say
 
02:43:52.429 --> 02:43:52.439 align:start position:0%
that our health care System should
 
02:43:55.950 --> 02:43:55.960 align:start position:0%
strive for Hope
 
02:43:59.870 --> 02:43:59.880 align:start position:0%
and people who are dying and sick and in
 
02:44:02.229 --> 02:44:02.239 align:start position:0%
loss of pain want to be lifted up by
 
02:44:04.070 --> 02:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
their Health Care system not told that
 
02:44:06.910 --> 02:44:06.920 align:start position:0%
they should just end it all right thank
 
02:44:08.790 --> 02:44:08.800 align:start position:0%
you questions for this
 
02:44:14.389 --> 02:44:14.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:17.950 --> 02:44:17.960 align:start position:0%
you no no no no
 
02:44:21.750 --> 02:44:21.760 align:start position:0%
sorry um next Reverend Andrew Nelson and
 
02:44:26.830 --> 02:44:26.840 align:start position:0%
the next witness will be uh Melinda
 
02:44:29.070 --> 02:44:29.080 align:start position:0%
Sims thank you Mr chairman my name is
 
02:44:30.550 --> 02:44:30.560 align:start position:0%
Father Andrew Nelson I'm from
 
02:44:32.550 --> 02:44:32.560 align:start position:0%
summersworth and I'm speaking here as a
 
02:44:34.990 --> 02:44:35.000 align:start position:0%
citizen today uh I'm not going to make
 
02:44:36.389 --> 02:44:36.399 align:start position:0%
the argument on a religious or moral
 
02:44:37.950 --> 02:44:37.960 align:start position:0%
ground because I don't think we need
 
02:44:39.550 --> 02:44:39.560 align:start position:0%
that I can make it on a rational ground
 
02:44:42.229 --> 02:44:42.239 align:start position:0%
and I'm here to speak against this bill
 
02:44:44.429 --> 02:44:44.439 align:start position:0%
I've personally attended at the bedside
 
02:44:46.790 --> 02:44:46.800 align:start position:0%
of thousands of deaths chaplain at eight
 
02:44:48.110 --> 02:44:48.120 align:start position:0%
hospitals including the number one
 
02:44:50.269 --> 02:44:50.279 align:start position:0%
Hospital in the world and chaplain and
 
02:44:52.070 --> 02:44:52.080 align:start position:0%
and attended the the bedsides at some of
 
02:44:54.550 --> 02:44:54.560 align:start position:0%
the most complicated cases there as well
 
02:44:56.070 --> 02:44:56.080 align:start position:0%
there's many cases that have been made
 
02:44:58.189 --> 02:44:58.199 align:start position:0%
here today many have talked about my
 
02:45:00.910 --> 02:45:00.920 align:start position:0%
state of birth Vermont where uh this is
 
02:45:03.229 --> 02:45:03.239 align:start position:0%
legal but we haven't talked about our
 
02:45:06.229 --> 02:45:06.239 align:start position:0%
neighbor directly to the north Quebec if
 
02:45:08.070 --> 02:45:08.080 align:start position:0%
you look at the statistics coming out of
 
02:45:12.429 --> 02:45:12.439 align:start position:0%
Quebec between 7 8% of all deaths are
 
02:45:15.630 --> 02:45:15.640 align:start position:0%
physician assisted that is current the
 
02:45:19.389 --> 02:45:19.399 align:start position:0%
most recent um information from the top
 
02:45:21.030 --> 02:45:21.040 align:start position:0%
top doctor on the end of Life Commission
 
02:45:24.229 --> 02:45:24.239 align:start position:0%
in Quebec is Raising major Flags because
 
02:45:26.469 --> 02:45:26.479 align:start position:0%
number one they're finding a disregard
 
02:45:29.269 --> 02:45:29.279 align:start position:0%
to the law by medical professionals in
 
02:45:32.110 --> 02:45:32.120 align:start position:0%
Quebec to our North 100 miles to our
 
02:45:33.990 --> 02:45:34.000 align:start position:0%
North they're finding that the the
 
02:45:36.510 --> 02:45:36.520 align:start position:0%
regulations being set are being largely
 
02:45:39.189 --> 02:45:39.199 align:start position:0%
ignored some will argue that this cannot
 
02:45:42.510 --> 02:45:42.520 align:start position:0%
happen here that that cultural
 
02:45:44.630 --> 02:45:44.640 align:start position:0%
shift and pressure that comes with
 
02:45:47.389 --> 02:45:47.399 align:start position:0%
youthanasia will not happen here but to
 
02:45:49.790 --> 02:45:49.800 align:start position:0%
to all who are gathered here I would say
 
02:45:52.590 --> 02:45:52.600 align:start position:0%
if you asked me 10 years ago if I
 
02:45:54.710 --> 02:45:54.720 align:start position:0%
thought our country could shift so much
 
02:45:56.269 --> 02:45:56.279 align:start position:0%
to a place where Republicans and
 
02:45:58.630 --> 02:45:58.640 align:start position:0%
Democrats and people of all sides of all
 
02:46:01.830 --> 02:46:01.840 align:start position:0%
issues were so divided that violence
 
02:46:03.750 --> 02:46:03.760 align:start position:0%
could happen in the streets I would say
 
02:46:06.110 --> 02:46:06.120 align:start position:0%
that is impossible yet it is something
 
02:46:08.550 --> 02:46:08.560 align:start position:0%
we have seen if you ask me when I was in
 
02:46:10.670 --> 02:46:10.680 align:start position:0%
high school if I could have imagined a
 
02:46:12.670 --> 02:46:12.680 align:start position:0%
future when kids would be afraid for
 
02:46:14.950 --> 02:46:14.960 align:start position:0%
their own safety in schools I would say
 
02:46:17.710 --> 02:46:17.720 align:start position:0%
that cultural shift could never happen
 
02:46:19.910 --> 02:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
yet we've watched it and if you look
 
02:46:23.229 --> 02:46:23.239 align:start position:0%
seriously at Quebec at Canada at Belgium
 
02:46:25.149 --> 02:46:25.159 align:start position:0%
at Oregon you look at places where this
 
02:46:28.750 --> 02:46:28.760 align:start position:0%
has been legalized that shift happens
 
02:46:31.110 --> 02:46:31.120 align:start position:0%
every suicide that I've ever attended to
 
02:46:33.630 --> 02:46:33.640 align:start position:0%
was chosen by the person who did it but
 
02:46:36.189 --> 02:46:36.199 align:start position:0%
I can say every person that ended their
 
02:46:38.790 --> 02:46:38.800 align:start position:0%
life with suicide felt pressure inside
 
02:46:40.189 --> 02:46:40.199 align:start position:0%
and out
 
02:46:44.070 --> 02:46:44.080 align:start position:0%
this is not the answer accompanyment is
 
02:46:45.870 --> 02:46:45.880 align:start position:0%
providing the resources to families who
 
02:46:47.950 --> 02:46:47.960 align:start position:0%
are struggling
 
02:46:51.950 --> 02:46:51.960 align:start position:0%
is you cannot underestimate the pressure
 
02:46:53.950 --> 02:46:53.960 align:start position:0%
that happens to people in these
 
02:46:56.070 --> 02:46:56.080 align:start position:0%
circumstances I have sat at bedsides
 
02:46:57.590 --> 02:46:57.600 align:start position:0%
with people who believe in God who
 
02:47:00.469 --> 02:47:00.479 align:start position:0%
people who do not believe in God the
 
02:47:03.110 --> 02:47:03.120 align:start position:0%
number one worry people say is not their
 
02:47:06.070 --> 02:47:06.080 align:start position:0%
pain and well that is real the number
 
02:47:07.750 --> 02:47:07.760 align:start position:0%
one worry people have is for their
 
02:47:09.710 --> 02:47:09.720 align:start position:0%
families and those they leave behind
 
02:47:13.070 --> 02:47:13.080 align:start position:0%
kind don't tell anyone here that that
 
02:47:15.389 --> 02:47:15.399 align:start position:0%
pressure financially or worrying that
 
02:47:17.189 --> 02:47:17.199 align:start position:0%
they're over biring their relatives
 
02:47:20.309 --> 02:47:20.319 align:start position:0%
doesn't way into the conversation just
 
02:47:22.149 --> 02:47:22.159 align:start position:0%
look at the one of the top reasons that
 
02:47:24.309 --> 02:47:24.319 align:start position:0%
people in Oregon have cited for
 
02:47:26.389 --> 02:47:26.399 align:start position:0%
euthanasia is the burden they are to
 
02:47:29.309 --> 02:47:29.319 align:start position:0%
their families pressure is real
 
02:47:31.870 --> 02:47:31.880 align:start position:0%
everyone's saying choice but I would beg
 
02:47:34.070 --> 02:47:34.080 align:start position:0%
you to consider the pressure that this
 
02:47:36.750 --> 02:47:36.760 align:start position:0%
legalization will bring and the societal
 
02:47:39.870 --> 02:47:39.880 align:start position:0%
shift that will happen I am horrified at
 
02:47:42.269 --> 02:47:42.279 align:start position:0%
the societal shifts left and right that
 
02:47:43.670 --> 02:47:43.680 align:start position:0%
have happened in our country in the last
 
02:47:46.429 --> 02:47:46.439 align:start position:0%
20 years it can happen we've watched it
 
02:47:49.590 --> 02:47:49.600 align:start position:0%
happen in 10 other places that I suspect
 
02:47:51.710 --> 02:47:51.720 align:start position:0%
not most of us here would have never
 
02:47:53.550 --> 02:47:53.560 align:start position:0%
dreamed could have happened whether it
 
02:47:56.510 --> 02:47:56.520 align:start position:0%
be schools and safety whether it be
 
02:47:58.269 --> 02:47:58.279 align:start position:0%
politics and violence in streets and
 
02:48:00.750 --> 02:48:00.760 align:start position:0%
places like this please don't think that
 
02:48:03.309 --> 02:48:03.319 align:start position:0%
those shifts don't happen they do
 
02:48:05.030 --> 02:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
questions for this
 
02:48:05.040 --> 02:48:08.429 align:start position:0%

02:49:43.429 --> 02:49:43.439 align:start position:0%
Prevention a
 
02:49:47.309 --> 02:49:47.319 align:start position:0%
priority but this is going to um create
 
02:49:49.229 --> 02:49:49.239 align:start position:0%
double standards to
 
02:49:53.229 --> 02:49:53.239 align:start position:0%
that this um the Danish Council of
 
02:49:55.990 --> 02:49:56.000 align:start position:0%
Ethics they did an extensive study on
 
02:49:59.990 --> 02:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
the Oregon and Dutch models of assisted
 
02:50:03.070 --> 02:50:03.080 align:start position:0%
suicide and they say no members could
 
02:50:04.990 --> 02:50:05.000 align:start position:0%
find the Oregon or Dutch model
 
02:50:07.389 --> 02:50:07.399 align:start position:0%
sufficiently clear in their delineations
 
02:50:09.429 --> 02:50:09.439 align:start position:0%
to be fair and their justification
 
02:50:12.229 --> 02:50:12.239 align:start position:0%
ations for Access sounding terms or
 
02:50:12.239 --> 02:50:13.269 align:start position:0%
ations for Access sounding terms or
control

02:50:13.269 --> 02:50:13.279 align:start position:0%
control
 
02:50:16.990 --> 02:50:17.000 align:start position:0%
mechanisms this this bill lacks
 
02:50:19.750 --> 02:50:19.760 align:start position:0%
safeguards it's full of euphemisms
 
02:50:21.870 --> 02:50:21.880 align:start position:0%
ambiguous and obscure language it makes
 
02:50:24.670 --> 02:50:24.680 align:start position:0%
it easy for insurance companies to take
 
02:50:26.950 --> 02:50:26.960 align:start position:0%
the easy way out our veterans and
 
02:50:29.510 --> 02:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
disabled Community don't need youth in
 
02:50:31.630 --> 02:50:31.640 align:start position:0%
Asia as their first solution to their
 
02:50:34.870 --> 02:50:34.880 align:start position:0%
problem instead let's give access to
 
02:50:38.349 --> 02:50:38.359 align:start position:0%
robust Mental Health Services rehab
 
02:50:40.469 --> 02:50:40.479 align:start position:0%
programs and compassionate Health Care
 
02:50:43.750 --> 02:50:43.760 align:start position:0%
Systems let's provide comprehensive care
 
02:50:46.510 --> 02:50:46.520 align:start position:0%
that respects the dignity and worth of
 
02:50:48.750 --> 02:50:48.760 align:start position:0%

02:51:05.030 --> 02:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
medication you are allowed I choose not
 
02:51:08.590 --> 02:51:08.600 align:start position:0%
to take opioids I try to go towards uh
 
02:51:11.469 --> 02:51:11.479 align:start position:0%
more natural route okay so this bill
 
02:51:13.870 --> 02:51:13.880 align:start position:0%
would not help you because you do not
 
02:51:16.630 --> 02:51:16.640 align:start position:0%
have a terminal illness correct well
 
02:51:20.550 --> 02:51:20.560 align:start position:0%
actually um it is terminal because uh I
 
02:51:23.349 --> 02:51:23.359 align:start position:0%
have a degenerative spine and unstable
 
02:51:26.469 --> 02:51:26.479 align:start position:0%
spine so they told me to enjoy each and
 
02:51:29.349 --> 02:51:29.359 align:start position:0%
every day because any moment I could be
 
02:51:32.189 --> 02:51:32.199 align:start position:0%
dead okay but just quick followup yep
 
02:51:34.950 --> 02:51:34.960 align:start position:0%

02:51:37.950 --> 02:51:37.960 align:start position:0%
understanding that you would not be
 
02:51:40.590 --> 02:51:40.600 align:start position:0%
eligible for this under this bill is
 
02:51:43.429 --> 02:51:43.439 align:start position:0%

am a resident of Dober New Hampshire I

oppose House Bill 1283 from my
 
02:52:37.750 --> 02:52:37.760 align:start position:0%
perspective as a 26-year active duty
 
02:52:41.389 --> 02:52:41.399 align:start position:0%
military veteran in and after 15 year
 
02:52:43.349 --> 02:52:43.359 align:start position:0%
years in the fire service in the course
 
02:52:44.830 --> 02:52:44.840 align:start position:0%
of my service I have experienced the
 
02:52:47.309 --> 02:52:47.319 align:start position:0%
after effects of suicide on family and
 
02:52:49.510 --> 02:52:49.520 align:start position:0%
friends firsthand military personnel and
 
02:52:51.229 --> 02:52:51.239 align:start position:0%
firefighters facing ever increasing
 
02:52:53.550 --> 02:52:53.560 align:start position:0%
levels of stress from high-intensity
 
02:52:55.710 --> 02:52:55.720 align:start position:0%
operations and the ever increasing
 
02:52:58.950 --> 02:52:58.960 align:start position:0%
levels of cumulative exposure to
 
02:53:01.269 --> 02:53:01.279 align:start position:0%
trauma which can create an increased
 
02:53:03.950 --> 02:53:03.960 align:start position:0%
level of psychological
 
02:53:05.870 --> 02:53:05.880 align:start position:0%
fragility in addition the ever
 
02:53:07.710 --> 02:53:07.720 align:start position:0%
increasing stress anxiety and pressure
 
02:53:10.070 --> 02:53:10.080 align:start position:0%
within our society create psychological
 
02:53:11.950 --> 02:53:11.960 align:start position:0%
fragility and a higher incidence of
 
02:53:14.429 --> 02:53:14.439 align:start position:0%
Behavioral emergencies among people who
 
02:53:17.269 --> 02:53:17.279 align:start position:0%
might not otherwise be vulnerable this
 
02:53:19.070 --> 02:53:19.080 align:start position:0%
increased vulnerability is particularly
 
02:53:21.710 --> 02:53:21.720 align:start position:0%
prevalent among teens and those in their
 
02:53:24.070 --> 02:53:24.080 align:start position:0%
Middle Ages leading to an increased
 
02:53:27.389 --> 02:53:27.399 align:start position:0%
incident of suicide and suicidal
 
02:53:29.830 --> 02:53:29.840 align:start position:0%
ideations those Among Us who fall into
 
02:53:32.750 --> 02:53:32.760 align:start position:0%
hopelessness and contemplate suicide are
 
02:53:35.389 --> 02:53:35.399 align:start position:0%
often brought back from the brink by a
 
02:53:37.830 --> 02:53:37.840 align:start position:0%
caring voice on the other end of a phone
 
02:53:39.269 --> 02:53:39.279 align:start position:0%
a family member or friend friend who
 
02:53:42.229 --> 02:53:42.239 align:start position:0%
reaches out or a voice from the depth of
 
02:53:44.790 --> 02:53:44.800 align:start position:0%
their intellect reminding them that our
 
02:53:47.750 --> 02:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
society is based on a tremendous respect
 
02:53:51.469 --> 02:53:51.479 align:start position:0%
for life and a desire to live legalizing
 
02:53:54.309 --> 02:53:54.319 align:start position:0%
suicide in any form including physician
 
02:53:57.510 --> 02:53:57.520 align:start position:0%
assist a suicide for any reason even if
 
02:53:58.870 --> 02:53:58.880 align:start position:0%
well-intentioned will have the
 
02:54:00.990 --> 02:54:01.000 align:start position:0%
unintended consequence of increasing the
 
02:54:03.550 --> 02:54:03.560 align:start position:0%
acceptance of suicide in a subtle but
 
02:54:06.469 --> 02:54:06.479 align:start position:0%
dangerous way within our culture thereby
 
02:54:08.070 --> 02:54:08.080 align:start position:0%
lowering the threshold for many to
 
02:54:09.590 --> 02:54:09.600 align:start position:0%
commit suicide
 
02:54:11.429 --> 02:54:11.439 align:start position:0%
who might otherwise be helped back from
 
02:54:12.990 --> 02:54:13.000 align:start position:0%
the brink all right you're over your
 
02:54:15.070 --> 02:54:15.080 align:start position:0%
time sir so can I just ask you to sum up
 
02:54:17.189 --> 02:54:17.199 align:start position:0%
please quickly our societal Norms are
 
02:54:19.510 --> 02:54:19.520 align:start position:0%
under assault from many directions I
 
02:54:21.309 --> 02:54:21.319 align:start position:0%
urge you to help us hold the line and
 
02:54:23.149 --> 02:54:23.159 align:start position:0%
help maintain a society where life is
 
02:54:25.469 --> 02:54:25.479 align:start position:0%
valued including the lives of those who
 
02:54:28.510 --> 02:54:28.520 align:start position:0%
sacrifice for our freedom and our safety
 
02:54:29.910 --> 02:54:29.920 align:start position:0%
unlike what is happening in other
 
02:54:31.389 --> 02:54:31.399 align:start position:0%
countries I really need you to sum up
 
02:54:33.830 --> 02:54:33.840 align:start position:0%
Sir our culture needs a strong hand to
 
02:54:35.990 --> 02:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
pull a suicidal person back from the
 
02:54:38.229 --> 02:54:38.239 align:start position:0%
brink instead of creating a culture that
 
02:54:41.070 --> 02:54:41.080 align:start position:0%
recognizes and encourages suicide thank

02:58:09.630 --> 02:58:09.640 align:start position:0%
down a flight of stairs
 
02:58:12.030 --> 02:58:12.040 align:start position:0%
visiting him in the hospital he said to
 
02:58:14.670 --> 02:58:14.680 align:start position:0%
me next time I'll be sure to put a
 
02:58:17.830 --> 02:58:17.840 align:start position:0%
bullseye on my head when I asked my
 
02:58:19.590 --> 02:58:19.600 align:start position:0%
brother Mike if he thought that Dad was
 
02:58:21.309 --> 02:58:21.319 align:start position:0%
trying to kill himself by throwing
 
02:58:24.110 --> 02:58:24.120 align:start position:0%
himself down the stairs he nodded and
 
02:58:27.229 --> 02:58:27.239 align:start position:0%
told me that Dad had asked him to roll
 
02:58:30.070 --> 02:58:30.080 align:start position:0%
him into the garage and start the car
 
02:58:33.070 --> 02:58:33.080 align:start position:0%
and leave him there close to the
 
02:58:35.990 --> 02:58:36.000 align:start position:0%
exhaust at that time my dad's only
 
02:58:39.710 --> 02:58:39.720 align:start position:0%
option was to enure the Daily torture or
 
02:58:42.790 --> 02:58:42.800 align:start position:0%
try to kill himself in these inhumane
 
02:58:46.790 --> 02:58:46.800 align:start position:0%
and ultimately ineffective ways didn't
 
02:58:49.710 --> 02:58:49.720 align:start position:0%
he and everyone else in his position
 
02:58:53.550 --> 02:58:53.560 align:start position:0%
deserve better more Humane options like
 
02:58:56.229 --> 02:58:56.239 align:start position:0%
those we offer our beloved
 
02:58:58.790 --> 02:58:58.800 align:start position:0%
pets how can it be that someone with a
 
02:59:02.550 --> 02:59:02.560 align:start position:0%
terminal illness is left to suffer so
 
02:59:05.030 --> 02:59:05.040 align:start position:0%
horrifically I fervently urge you to
 
02:59:06.710 --> 02:59:06.720 align:start position:0%
support House Bill
 
02:59:09.710 --> 02:59:09.720 align:start position:0%
1283 because it gives options to people
 
02:59:12.750 --> 02:59:12.760 align:start position:0%
whose suffering is simply
 
02:59:15.630 --> 02:59:15.640 align:start position:0%
unbearable no solution we can come up
 
02:59:18.469 --> 02:59:18.479 align:start position:0%
with here is perfect but we must have
 
02:59:20.990 --> 02:59:21.000 align:start position:0%
the courage to do the best we can in
 
02:59:23.590 --> 02:59:23.600 align:start position:0%
order to support our loved ones at their
 
02:59:27.670 --> 02:59:27.680 align:start position:0%
Journey's End and this is not part of my
 
02:59:29.750 --> 02:59:29.760 align:start position:0%
written testimony but I've heard a lot
 
02:59:33.030 --> 02:59:33.040 align:start position:0%
today about concerns about suicide and I
 
02:59:35.070 --> 02:59:35.080 align:start position:0%
am a newly
 
02:59:38.950 --> 02:59:38.960 align:start position:0%
retired psychotherapist after 50 years
 
02:59:42.110 --> 02:59:42.120 align:start position:0%
practicing and I have had my share of
 
02:59:45.189 --> 02:59:45.199 align:start position:0%
family members crying in my office
 
02:59:47.149 --> 02:59:47.159 align:start position:0%
because their loved one took them took
 
02:59:51.710 --> 02:59:51.720 align:start position:0%
their lives life and I just think it's
 
02:59:53.790 --> 02:59:53.800 align:start position:0%
really important that we separate those
 
02:59:56.710 --> 02:59:56.720 align:start position:0%
two issues this really has nothing to do
 
02:59:59.269 --> 02:59:59.279 align:start position:0%
with that we need this bill we need
 
03:00:01.630 --> 03:00:01.640 align:start position:0%
better mental health care and support
 
03:00:04.309 --> 03:00:04.319 align:start position:0%
for families and people struggling with
 
03:00:06.870 --> 03:00:06.880 align:start position:0%
mental illness and we need better
 
03:00:09.790 --> 03:00:09.800 align:start position:0%
paliative care train positions but we
 
03:00:11.950 --> 03:00:11.960 align:start position:0%
need this Bill thank you very much
 
03:00:13.149 --> 03:00:13.159 align:start position:0%
questions for this
 
03:00:16.510 --> 03:00:16.520 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you um I
 
03:00:19.550 --> 03:00:19.560 align:start position:0%
should just I just want to uh note for
 
03:00:21.149 --> 03:00:21.159 align:start position:0%
for people that are here we're as you
 
03:00:23.030 --> 03:00:23.040 align:start position:0%

03:00:24.590 --> 03:00:24.600 align:start position:0%
other hearing schedule beginning at one
 
03:00:27.149 --> 03:00:27.159 align:start position:0%
o'clock so what I'm going to do is at
 
03:00:29.870 --> 03:00:29.880 align:start position:0%
one o'clock I'm going to recess the

at 3 3:15 the last hearing on another
 
03:00:43.750 --> 03:00:43.760 align:start position:0%
bill when that hearing
 
03:00:46.349 --> 03:00:46.359 align:start position:0%
concludes which I believe that bill at
 
03:00:49.870 --> 03:00:49.880 align:start position:0%
least will be relatively short uh we
 
03:00:51.790 --> 03:00:51.800 align:start position:0%
will then resume the hearing on this
 
03:00:56.110 --> 03:00:56.120 align:start position:0%

uh before we resume the hearing on this
 
03:01:05.630 --> 03:01:05.640 align:start position:0%

2022 of
 
03:02:08.630 --> 03:02:08.640 align:start position:0%
cancer he went through four group ruling
 
03:02:12.309 --> 03:02:12.319 align:start position:0%
years of very difficult treatment his
 
03:02:15.189 --> 03:02:15.199 align:start position:0%
surgeon said that he was heroic his
 
03:02:18.389 --> 03:02:18.399 align:start position:0%
oncologist said that he endured
 
03:02:22.630 --> 03:02:22.640 align:start position:0%
more life-altering treatments surgeries
 
03:02:25.149 --> 03:02:25.159 align:start position:0%
infections side effects than almost
 
03:02:28.349 --> 03:02:28.359 align:start position:0%
anyone he had ever worked with he wanted
 
03:02:31.590 --> 03:02:31.600 align:start position:0%
to live finally it was time and Bob
 
03:02:34.429 --> 03:02:34.439 align:start position:0%
enrolled in hospice we had wonderful
 
03:02:36.630 --> 03:02:36.640 align:start position:0%
hospice care it was
 
03:02:39.990 --> 03:02:40.000 align:start position:0%
fabulous however in hospice Bob had
 
03:02:42.550 --> 03:02:42.560 align:start position:0%
unbearable breakthrough pain his
 
03:02:45.149 --> 03:02:45.159 align:start position:0%
tracheostomy tube constantly clogged
 
03:02:46.830 --> 03:02:46.840 align:start position:0%
threatening to choke him and he had
 
03:02:49.590 --> 03:02:49.600 align:start position:0%
bouts of losing Consciousness falling
 
03:02:51.349 --> 03:02:51.359 align:start position:0%
down without a moment's notice and
 
03:02:53.750 --> 03:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
losing all control of his bodily
 
03:02:57.229 --> 03:02:57.239 align:start position:0%
functions it was only at that point that
 
03:03:01.110 --> 03:03:01.120 align:start position:0%
he desired Medical Aid in dying and as
 
03:03:03.349 --> 03:03:03.359 align:start position:0%
his suffering increase knowing this was
 
03:03:06.469 --> 03:03:06.479 align:start position:0%
not there for him he thought a lot about
 
03:03:09.070 --> 03:03:09.080 align:start position:0%
overdosing on his Hospital this
 
03:03:11.710 --> 03:03:11.720 align:start position:0%
medications in the end he decided not to
 
03:03:13.510 --> 03:03:13.520 align:start position:0%
he was afraid it wouldn't work and he'd
 
03:03:17.429 --> 03:03:17.439 align:start position:0%
end up worse off or that his family
 
03:03:20.389 --> 03:03:20.399 align:start position:0%
would somehow suffer legal repercussions
 
03:03:22.469 --> 03:03:22.479 align:start position:0%
a couple weeks before he died he wrote
 
03:03:25.309 --> 03:03:25.319 align:start position:0%
in his journal about his desire for a
 
03:03:27.830 --> 03:03:27.840 align:start position:0%
peaceful death and if only that could
 
03:03:31.349 --> 03:03:31.359 align:start position:0%
have happened when he died he woke up in
 
03:03:33.309 --> 03:03:33.319 align:start position:0%
the middle of the night bleeding from
 
03:03:33.319 --> 03:03:34.389 align:start position:0%
the middle of the night bleeding from
his

03:03:34.389 --> 03:03:34.399 align:start position:0%
his
 
03:03:37.550 --> 03:03:37.560 align:start position:0%
tracheostomy a forceful stream of Blood
 
03:03:39.710 --> 03:03:39.720 align:start position:0%
and Tissue issue ensued that we could
 
03:03:43.510 --> 03:03:43.520 align:start position:0%
not stop all I could do was hold him and
 
03:03:47.189 --> 03:03:47.199 align:start position:0%
tell him how loved he was my sweet
 
03:03:50.590 --> 03:03:50.600 align:start position:0%
husband simultaneously bled to death and
 
03:03:53.229 --> 03:03:53.239 align:start position:0%
drowned in his own blood because he
 
03:03:55.990 --> 03:03:56.000 align:start position:0%
could not have the Medical Aid in dying
 
03:03:57.229 --> 03:03:57.239 align:start position:0%
that he
 
03:04:01.349 --> 03:04:01.359 align:start position:0%
desired in his situation as a wife this
 
03:04:04.229 --> 03:04:04.239 align:start position:0%
breaks my heart again and again as a
 
03:04:07.229 --> 03:04:07.239 align:start position:0%
minister I do not believe for one moment
 
03:04:09.630 --> 03:04:09.640 align:start position:0%
that this death death or his disease
 
03:04:12.269 --> 03:04:12.279 align:start position:0%
were the will of God God is found in
 
03:04:14.750 --> 03:04:14.760 align:start position:0%
comfort and accompaniment not in
 
03:04:14.760 --> 03:04:16.110 align:start position:0%

them if this bill were to pass we would

not be establishing a commission that

work and then it will
 
03:31:33.950 --> 03:31:33.960 align:start position:0%
sunset second in the bill before you
 
03:31:36.910 --> 03:31:36.920 align:start position:0%

be forthcoming will reduce that number
 
03:31:45.469 --> 03:31:45.479 align:start position:0%
to something much more manageable and
 
03:31:48.109 --> 03:31:48.119 align:start position:0%
the work that will be done will be a
 
03:31:50.469 --> 03:31:50.479 align:start position:0%

03:32:56.199 --> 03:32:58.710 align:start position:0%
 
bill

03:32:58.710 --> 03:32:58.720 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:33:01.229 --> 03:33:01.239 align:start position:0%
however it is now
 
03:33:04.590 --> 03:33:04.600 align:start position:0%
February this bill will work its way
 
03:33:07.869 --> 03:33:07.879 align:start position:0%
through even if we act very quickly
 
03:33:10.189 --> 03:33:10.199 align:start position:0%
through here across to the
 
03:33:12.990 --> 03:33:13.000 align:start position:0%
Senate assume that the Senate moves with
 
03:33:17.551 --> 03:33:17.561 align:start position:0%
it assume that the governor signs it
 
03:33:20.750 --> 03:33:20.760 align:start position:0%
without uh a delay that happens very
 
03:33:20.760 --> 03:33:22.189 align:start position:0%
without uh a delay that happens very
very

03:33:22.189 --> 03:33:22.199 align:start position:0%
very
 
03:33:27.429 --> 03:33:27.439 align:start position:0%
frequently it will likely not be before
 
03:33:31.990 --> 03:33:32.000 align:start position:0%
September that uh if we're lucky that
 
03:33:36.551 --> 03:33:36.561 align:start position:0%
even a reduced commission is AA
 
03:33:40.670 --> 03:33:40.680 align:start position:0%
established could I ask you why you
 
03:33:45.470 --> 03:33:45.480 align:start position:0%
think you have to have all of those
 
03:33:45.480 --> 03:33:46.990 align:start position:0%
think you have to have all of those
participants

03:33:46.990 --> 03:33:47.000 align:start position:0%
participants
 
03:33:49.109 --> 03:33:49.119 align:start position:0%
specified in
 
03:33:52.470 --> 03:33:52.480 align:start position:0%
legislation rather than expecting that
 
03:33:52.480 --> 03:33:53.551 align:start position:0%
legislation rather than expecting that
the

03:33:53.551 --> 03:33:53.561 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:33:57.470 --> 03:33:57.480 align:start position:0%
importance of a legislative
 
03:34:01.429 --> 03:34:01.439 align:start position:0%
request would be enough for all of those
 
03:34:04.390 --> 03:34:04.400 align:start position:0%
organizations that want in fact to that
 
03:34:07.590 --> 03:34:07.600 align:start position:0%
have a vested interest in this to come
 
03:34:11.429 --> 03:34:11.439 align:start position:0%
and meet with a group of legislators to
 
03:34:14.709 --> 03:34:14.719 align:start position:0%
come up with the best possible
 
03:34:16.830 --> 03:34:16.840 align:start position:0%
plan well
 
03:34:19.150 --> 03:34:19.160 align:start position:0%
representative from personal experience
 
03:34:21.109 --> 03:34:21.119 align:start position:0%
every time you make a suggestion to me
 
03:34:23.470 --> 03:34:23.480 align:start position:0%
to change something a I take it to heart
 
03:34:27.629 --> 03:34:27.639 align:start position:0%
and B almost every time I wind up doing
 
03:34:31.629 --> 03:34:31.639 align:start position:0%
it so why not and I would suggest that
 
03:34:37.269 --> 03:34:37.279 align:start position:0%
the specifics of how and who be left to
 
03:34:39.750 --> 03:34:39.760 align:start position:0%
um attorney Stevens and a few others
 
03:34:42.150 --> 03:34:42.160 align:start position:0%
that perhaps an amendment could do
 
03:34:45.830 --> 03:34:45.840 align:start position:0%
exactly that I'm quite open to it I just
 
03:34:48.551 --> 03:34:48.561 align:start position:0%
want a commission to get going look at
 
03:34:53.750 --> 03:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
the topic and make recommendations how
 
03:34:56.029 --> 03:34:56.039 align:start position:0%
we can figure that out together thank
 
03:35:00.551 --> 03:35:00.561 align:start position:0%
you very much other questions for this
 
03:35:03.310 --> 03:35:03.320 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you very oh
 
03:35:05.789 --> 03:35:05.799 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry yeah
 
03:35:07.551 --> 03:35:07.561 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um
 
03:35:08.949 --> 03:35:08.959 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um
 
03:35:10.429 --> 03:35:10.439 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson I don't know if
 
03:35:14.390 --> 03:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
you went to this um in-house um house
 
03:35:17.189 --> 03:35:17.199 align:start position:0%
continuing education on study committees
 
03:35:19.310 --> 03:35:19.320 align:start position:0%
and commissions but there's a lot of
 
03:35:22.949 --> 03:35:22.959 align:start position:0%
information here um and there's sort of
 
03:35:25.150 --> 03:35:25.160 align:start position:0%
like a um a cookbook
 
03:35:28.070 --> 03:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
on what sort of um action you want to
 
03:35:30.750 --> 03:35:30.760 align:start position:0%
take and it breaks down to do you want
 
03:35:32.670 --> 03:35:32.680 align:start position:0%
to do a study commission do you want to
 
03:35:36.109 --> 03:35:36.119 align:start position:0%
do um a standing committee subcommittee
 
03:35:38.269 --> 03:35:38.279 align:start position:0%
uh retain subcommittee interim study ad
 
03:35:40.949 --> 03:35:40.959 align:start position:0%
hoc subcommittee chapter study so there
 
03:35:43.709 --> 03:35:43.719 align:start position:0%
are alternatives you know and with this
 
03:35:45.789 --> 03:35:45.799 align:start position:0%
being the second year of a banum it
 
03:35:47.990 --> 03:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
might be good to look at one of the
 
03:35:49.949 --> 03:35:49.959 align:start position:0%
alternatives to answer your question
 
03:35:52.029 --> 03:35:52.039 align:start position:0%
representative yes I did look at all of
 
03:35:56.349 --> 03:35:56.359 align:start position:0%
that and I was asked to submit this bill
 
03:35:59.349 --> 03:35:59.359 align:start position:0%
uh because they seem to think that might
 
03:36:03.709 --> 03:36:03.719 align:start position:0%
be good for the bill so again I'm quite
 
03:36:05.150 --> 03:36:05.160 align:start position:0%
happy to turn it over to the people
 
03:36:06.670 --> 03:36:06.680 align:start position:0%
people who encouraged me to file the
 
03:36:10.590 --> 03:36:10.600 align:start position:0%
bill to see if the same or better result
 
03:36:13.109 --> 03:36:13.119 align:start position:0%
could occur from this or a very
 
03:36:15.629 --> 03:36:15.639 align:start position:0%
different way of doing it oh thank you
 
03:36:17.470 --> 03:36:17.480 align:start position:0%
and I I just want to say this isn't a
 
03:36:20.670 --> 03:36:20.680 align:start position:0%
criticism I actually made the mistake of
 
03:36:22.990 --> 03:36:23.000 align:start position:0%
um getting a a chaptered study
 
03:36:26.070 --> 03:36:26.080 align:start position:0%
commission together and um after a while
 
03:36:28.590 --> 03:36:28.600 align:start position:0%
I found out that I didn't really need it
 
03:36:30.269 --> 03:36:30.279 align:start position:0%
that there were other methods to you
 
03:36:31.670 --> 03:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
know take care of this I've made that
 
03:36:33.470 --> 03:36:33.480 align:start position:0%
mistake too maybe I'm making it again
 
03:36:34.590 --> 03:36:34.600 align:start position:0%
but I think they're going to bring an
 
03:36:36.830 --> 03:36:36.840 align:start position:0%
amendment okay well thank you so much
 
03:36:39.551 --> 03:36:39.561 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions yes
 
03:36:41.750 --> 03:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
representative Stapleton thank you Mr
 
03:36:43.269 --> 03:36:43.279 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
03:36:48.349 --> 03:36:48.359 align:start position:0%
question on page one uh line 22 I've
 
03:36:50.109 --> 03:36:50.119 align:start position:0%
just caught this uh the current
 
03:36:52.390 --> 03:36:52.400 align:start position:0%
statutory definition of insanity in New
 
03:36:54.830 --> 03:36:54.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire originating in 1871 is
 
03:36:56.949 --> 03:36:56.959 align:start position:0%
outdated and not in keeping with today's
 
03:36:59.070 --> 03:36:59.080 align:start position:0%
standards of the dignity afforded to
 
03:37:01.109 --> 03:37:01.119 align:start position:0%
people with mental
 
03:37:04.349 --> 03:37:04.359 align:start position:0%
illness uh instead of a commission could
 
03:37:06.590 --> 03:37:06.600 align:start position:0%
there at least be a starting point with
 
03:37:10.990 --> 03:37:11.000 align:start position:0%
a bill to redefine in better terms of
 
03:37:13.629 --> 03:37:13.639 align:start position:0%
understanding uh insanity and and use
 
03:37:15.750 --> 03:37:15.760 align:start position:0%
that as a starting point for further
 
03:37:17.910 --> 03:37:17.920 align:start position:0%
bills and action thank you for your
 
03:37:20.670 --> 03:37:20.680 align:start position:0%
question representative I think that um
 
03:37:24.310 --> 03:37:24.320 align:start position:0%
1871 itself tells us we need to update
 
03:37:28.109 --> 03:37:28.119 align:start position:0%
but the group of people enumerated in
 
03:37:31.949 --> 03:37:31.959 align:start position:0%
the bill to be reduced by the amendment
 
03:37:33.390 --> 03:37:33.400 align:start position:0%
is the group that would come up with
 
03:37:35.590 --> 03:37:35.600 align:start position:0%
that definition
 
03:37:35.600 --> 03:37:36.349 align:start position:0%
that definition
thank

03:37:36.349 --> 03:37:36.359 align:start position:0%

Hamshire I'm here today to speak in
 
03:38:33.310 --> 03:38:33.320 align:start position:0%
support of House Bill 1020 as you heard
 
03:38:35.830 --> 03:38:35.840 align:start position:0%
from representative Pearson uh Nami New
 
03:38:37.390 --> 03:38:37.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was one of the uh
 
03:38:39.269 --> 03:38:39.279 align:start position:0%
organizations that did request that he
 
03:38:44.230 --> 03:38:44.240 align:start position:0%
file this bill um I'm uh saw him at a
 
03:38:47.070 --> 03:38:47.080 align:start position:0%
training on the courts and mental health
 
03:38:49.869 --> 03:38:49.879 align:start position:0%
over the summer um and during that um
 
03:38:51.670 --> 03:38:51.680 align:start position:0%
training they did talk about competency
 
03:38:53.510 --> 03:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
and the lack of the process that we have
 
03:38:58.429 --> 03:38:58.439 align:start position:0%
in our state um we do lack any formal
 
03:39:01.189 --> 03:39:01.199 align:start position:0%
restoration process or system to provide
 
03:39:02.709 --> 03:39:02.719 align:start position:0%
treatment to individuals who are found
 
03:39:05.189 --> 03:39:05.199 align:start position:0%
not competent to stand trial for these
 
03:39:06.629 --> 03:39:06.639 align:start position:0%
individuals the mental health court
 
03:39:08.990 --> 03:39:09.000 align:start position:0%
system isn't even an option because
 
03:39:11.310 --> 03:39:11.320 align:start position:0%
those programs require consent which a
 
03:39:14.470 --> 03:39:14.480 align:start position:0%
person deemed incompetent cannot
 
03:39:17.429 --> 03:39:17.439 align:start position:0%
give they also require an understanding
 
03:39:19.510 --> 03:39:19.520 align:start position:0%
of the criminal and judicial process
 
03:39:21.510 --> 03:39:21.520 align:start position:0%
which a person who is deemed incompetent
 
03:39:24.750 --> 03:39:24.760 align:start position:0%
does not have nationwide about 81% of
 
03:39:26.830 --> 03:39:26.840 align:start position:0%
individuals found not competent to stand
 
03:39:29.709 --> 03:39:29.719 align:start position:0%
trial have their competency restored and
 
03:39:32.551 --> 03:39:32.561 align:start position:0%
are able to return to court um in New
 
03:39:35.349 --> 03:39:35.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in 2019 only
 
03:39:38.150 --> 03:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
44% of individuals found not competent
 
03:39:40.310 --> 03:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
stand trial were restored and able to
 
03:39:43.230 --> 03:39:43.240 align:start position:0%
actually um go back to court um if
 
03:39:45.550 --> 03:39:45.560 align:start position:0%
people are not restored in a year those
 
03:39:48.390 --> 03:39:48.400 align:start position:0%
charges are dropped and the court
 
03:39:50.990 --> 03:39:51.000 align:start position:0%
process does not go forward which means
 
03:39:52.868 --> 03:39:52.878 align:start position:0%
you've got a person who is not getting
 
03:39:54.830 --> 03:39:54.840 align:start position:0%
treatment the treatment that they need
 
03:39:56.150 --> 03:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
um because we don't have a process to
 
03:39:58.990 --> 03:39:59.000 align:start position:0%
restore them but you also have somebody
 
03:40:01.708 --> 03:40:01.718 align:start position:0%
who is potentially the victim of a crime
 
03:40:04.430 --> 03:40:04.440 align:start position:0%
who does not receive um any kind of
 
03:40:04.440 --> 03:40:05.430 align:start position:0%
who does not receive um any kind of
closure

03:40:05.430 --> 03:40:05.440 align:start position:0%
closure
 
03:40:07.430 --> 03:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
because their trial does not go
 
03:40:11.070 --> 03:40:11.080 align:start position:0%
forward um and it's been our experience
 
03:40:12.830 --> 03:40:12.840 align:start position:0%
um working with families of loved ones
 
03:40:15.310 --> 03:40:15.320 align:start position:0%
who are found not compid to see in trial
 
03:40:16.830 --> 03:40:16.840 align:start position:0%
that their loved ones see this as a
 
03:40:18.830 --> 03:40:18.840 align:start position:0%
missed opportunity for them to receive
 
03:40:20.150 --> 03:40:20.160 align:start position:0%
treatment because we do not have a
 
03:40:22.430 --> 03:40:22.440 align:start position:0%
restoration process in this state and I
 
03:40:23.708 --> 03:40:23.718 align:start position:0%
know that there were a lot of different
 
03:40:25.190 --> 03:40:25.200 align:start position:0%
questions about whether this should be a
 
03:40:27.310 --> 03:40:27.320 align:start position:0%
commission a committee how it could be
 
03:40:29.628 --> 03:40:29.638 align:start position:0%
done um one of the reasons that we
 
03:40:31.510 --> 03:40:31.520 align:start position:0%
looked at doing a commission is because
 
03:40:33.788 --> 03:40:33.798 align:start position:0%
right now um the governor's Commission
 
03:40:35.670 --> 03:40:35.680 align:start position:0%
on mental health and Injustice involved
 
03:40:39.110 --> 03:40:39.120 align:start position:0%
individuals and I might have that um
 
03:40:42.110 --> 03:40:42.120 align:start position:0%
commission wrong um but uh attorney gry
 
03:40:44.190 --> 03:40:44.200 align:start position:0%
from the Attorney General's office is
 
03:40:46.150 --> 03:40:46.160 align:start position:0%
here to answer any questions if you have
 
03:40:49.030 --> 03:40:49.040 align:start position:0%
any of him um this is a there's a
 
03:40:50.708 --> 03:40:50.718 align:start position:0%
subcommittee that's been working on
 
03:40:53.830 --> 03:40:53.840 align:start position:0%
competency for a couple of years now and
 
03:40:55.510 --> 03:40:55.520 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of expertise that's gone
 
03:40:56.868 --> 03:40:56.878 align:start position:0%
into this there's a lot of work that's
 
03:40:59.510 --> 03:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
already been done many of the members
 
03:41:01.550 --> 03:41:01.560 align:start position:0%
that are named to this commission are
 
03:41:03.230 --> 03:41:03.240 align:start position:0%
members that have been working on this
 
03:41:04.910 --> 03:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
for two years and would bring their
 
03:41:07.750 --> 03:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
expertise and their knowledge with them
 
03:41:09.628 --> 03:41:09.638 align:start position:0%
um so rather than just coming in and
 
03:41:12.310 --> 03:41:12.320 align:start position:0%
testifying on a half an hour of what
 
03:41:13.830 --> 03:41:13.840 align:start position:0%
they know they would be sitting at the
 
03:41:15.550 --> 03:41:15.560 align:start position:0%
table with all of their knowledge that
 
03:41:17.430 --> 03:41:17.440 align:start position:0%
they've been that they have gained over
 
03:41:20.310 --> 03:41:20.320 align:start position:0%
the last couple of years um so that's
 
03:41:21.708 --> 03:41:21.718 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons that we thought that
 
03:41:23.550 --> 03:41:23.560 align:start position:0%
this commission would be better suited
 
03:41:27.030 --> 03:41:27.040 align:start position:0%
than a committee uh myself and our
 
03:41:29.550 --> 03:41:29.560 align:start position:0%
executive director Susan Sterns met with
 
03:41:32.670 --> 03:41:32.680 align:start position:0%
um speaker Packard um prior to the
 
03:41:35.948 --> 03:41:35.958 align:start position:0%
session about this bill he asked us to
 
03:41:38.030 --> 03:41:38.040 align:start position:0%
do a couple of things he asked us to
 
03:41:40.470 --> 03:41:40.480 align:start position:0%
reduce the amount of work that the
 
03:41:41.948 --> 03:41:41.958 align:start position:0%
commission would be doing and we looked
 
03:41:44.750 --> 03:41:44.760 align:start position:0%
at it and determined that the Insanity
 
03:41:46.470 --> 03:41:46.480 align:start position:0%
part of it could probably be done
 
03:41:48.270 --> 03:41:48.280 align:start position:0%
somewhere else or could probably be done
 
03:41:50.708 --> 03:41:50.718 align:start position:0%
at a different time the competency
 
03:41:52.590 --> 03:41:52.600 align:start position:0%
portion of it is extremely important
 
03:41:54.270 --> 03:41:54.280 align:start position:0%
especially with the forensic Hospital
 
03:41:57.550 --> 03:41:57.560 align:start position:0%
opening um the uh New Hampshire hospital
 
03:42:00.070 --> 03:42:00.080 align:start position:0%
I've been in touch with um Dr Jeffrey
 
03:42:02.510 --> 03:42:02.520 align:start position:0%
feder who also feels that this is a very
 
03:42:05.750 --> 03:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
important um that this work get done
 
03:42:09.670 --> 03:42:09.680 align:start position:0%
before the forensic Hospital opens
 
03:42:11.990 --> 03:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
um uh which is why it's important for
 
03:42:14.110 --> 03:42:14.120 align:start position:0%
this commission to go forward the other
 
03:42:16.750 --> 03:42:16.760 align:start position:0%
thing that um speaker Packard asked us
 
03:42:19.628 --> 03:42:19.638 align:start position:0%
to do is look at the commission the
 
03:42:21.670 --> 03:42:21.680 align:start position:0%
breadth of the commission and and reduce
 
03:42:25.190 --> 03:42:25.200 align:start position:0%
the number of folks so I have um worked
 
03:42:29.390 --> 03:42:29.400 align:start position:0%
with representative Pearson on a
 
03:42:31.670 --> 03:42:31.680 align:start position:0%
potential amendment that would reduce
 
03:42:33.550 --> 03:42:33.560 align:start position:0%
the number of folks on the commission
 
03:42:34.830 --> 03:42:34.840 align:start position:0%
the other thing that I did was reached
 
03:42:36.948 --> 03:42:36.958 align:start position:0%
out to most of them and asked them one
 
03:42:38.670 --> 03:42:38.680 align:start position:0%
did they have an interest in serving and
 
03:42:40.510 --> 03:42:40.520 align:start position:0%
two if they did would they attend in
 
03:42:42.910 --> 03:42:42.920 align:start position:0%
person um because it's come to my
 
03:42:46.390 --> 03:42:46.400 align:start position:0%
attention that these commissions get uh
 
03:42:48.750 --> 03:42:48.760 align:start position:0%
formed and then nobody shows up and no
 
03:42:50.070 --> 03:42:50.080 align:start position:0%
work can get done because there's not a
 
03:42:51.990 --> 03:42:52.000 align:start position:0%
quorum so that was one of the things
 
03:42:53.830 --> 03:42:53.840 align:start position:0%
that I asked was are you are you willing
 
03:42:55.310 --> 03:42:55.320 align:start position:0%
to serve and are you willing to serve in
 
03:42:57.270 --> 03:42:57.280 align:start position:0%
person anybody who was not willing to
 
03:42:58.868 --> 03:42:58.878 align:start position:0%
serve in person and the folks that did
 
03:43:02.470 --> 03:43:02.480 align:start position:0%
not get back to me I marked off and um
 
03:43:04.670 --> 03:43:04.680 align:start position:0%
that that amendment can come forward for
 
03:43:06.590 --> 03:43:06.600 align:start position:0%
your consideration if you have an
 
03:43:09.510 --> 03:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
interest in it um I'll end my testimony
 
03:43:11.150 --> 03:43:11.160 align:start position:0%
with that and I'll take any questions
 
03:43:12.868 --> 03:43:12.878 align:start position:0%
but Nami no Hamshire is in support of
 
03:43:16.190 --> 03:43:16.200 align:start position:0%
this Bill yes representative
 
03:43:19.350 --> 03:43:19.360 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you you've been before us
 
03:43:22.628 --> 03:43:22.638 align:start position:0%
and have done excellent work and and
 
03:43:24.270 --> 03:43:24.280 align:start position:0%
bring a good perspective to this
 
03:43:26.110 --> 03:43:26.120 align:start position:0%
committee and I appreciate it very much
 
03:43:29.430 --> 03:43:29.440 align:start position:0%
but I think we might have done a
 
03:43:33.270 --> 03:43:33.280 align:start position:0%
disservice um to you uh perhaps in some
 
03:43:35.030 --> 03:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
of our hearings
 
03:43:38.230 --> 03:43:38.240 align:start position:0%
um if in fact you were feeling rushed or
 
03:43:40.628 --> 03:43:40.638 align:start position:0%
whatever I am not
 
03:43:43.550 --> 03:43:43.560 align:start position:0%
suggesting that this be handled in a
 
03:43:48.990 --> 03:43:49.000 align:start position:0%
hearing what I'm suggesting is that an
 
03:43:51.910 --> 03:43:51.920 align:start position:0%
appropriate committee and it probably is
 
03:43:54.350 --> 03:43:54.360 align:start position:0%
not this Comm it may be this committee
 
03:43:57.230 --> 03:43:57.240 align:start position:0%
it may be uh children and family it may
 
03:44:00.868 --> 03:44:00.878 align:start position:0%
be a combination of both but that it be
 
03:44:05.150 --> 03:44:05.160 align:start position:0%
a legislative committee and that
 
03:44:08.948 --> 03:44:08.958 align:start position:0%
we would convene or it would convene um
 
03:44:12.390 --> 03:44:12.400 align:start position:0%
in effect in a work session where
 
03:44:16.430 --> 03:44:16.440 align:start position:0%
sitting at the table would be members of
 
03:44:19.670 --> 03:44:19.680 align:start position:0%
the legislative committee and those
 
03:44:21.830 --> 03:44:21.840 align:start position:0%
people willing to come and
 
03:44:24.030 --> 03:44:24.040 align:start position:0%
participate to take their place
 
03:44:26.910 --> 03:44:26.920 align:start position:0%
literally at the table to share their
 
03:44:28.788 --> 03:44:28.798 align:start position:0%
views and to help us come up with
 
03:44:32.270 --> 03:44:32.280 align:start position:0%
something all of which can happen
 
03:44:36.070 --> 03:44:36.080 align:start position:0%
immediately without having to wait for
 
03:44:38.390 --> 03:44:38.400 align:start position:0%
disperate organizations to make
 
03:44:40.270 --> 03:44:40.280 align:start position:0%
appointments for the governor's office
 
03:44:43.990 --> 03:44:44.000 align:start position:0%
to make an appointment for whomever else
 
03:44:46.948 --> 03:44:46.958 align:start position:0%
and not be able to have a committee
 
03:44:49.628 --> 03:44:49.638 align:start position:0%
really function until the fall so
 
03:44:51.510 --> 03:44:51.520 align:start position:0%
because I think the issue is very
 
03:44:53.628 --> 03:44:53.638 align:start position:0%
important and I think we ought to do
 
03:44:56.750 --> 03:44:56.760 align:start position:0%
something I wonder if you would consider
 
03:45:00.830 --> 03:45:00.840 align:start position:0%
the possibility of completely changing
 
03:45:05.190 --> 03:45:05.200 align:start position:0%
this in order to ask that it be studied
 
03:45:09.708 --> 03:45:09.718 align:start position:0%
by the legis the a legislative committee
 
03:45:12.628 --> 03:45:12.638 align:start position:0%
either created specially
 
03:45:17.270 --> 03:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
or um a statutory legislative committee
 
03:45:19.430 --> 03:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
um to do the work that could happen
 
03:45:19.440 --> 03:45:21.350 align:start position:0%
um to do the work that could happen
almost

03:45:21.350 --> 03:45:21.360 align:start position:0%
almost
 
03:45:23.708 --> 03:45:23.718 align:start position:0%
immediately I would not be opposed to
 
03:45:26.670 --> 03:45:26.680 align:start position:0%
that um I do think that a
 
03:45:26.680 --> 03:45:28.310 align:start position:0%
that um I do think that a
commission

03:45:28.310 --> 03:45:28.320 align:start position:0%
commission
 
03:45:31.948 --> 03:45:31.958 align:start position:0%
um mainly because of the fact that it
 
03:45:33.990 --> 03:45:34.000 align:start position:0%
would be hard to get notice out to it's
 
03:45:35.550 --> 03:45:35.560 align:start position:0%
easier to get notice out to commission
 
03:45:37.390 --> 03:45:37.400 align:start position:0%
members that are on an email list to say
 
03:45:39.550 --> 03:45:39.560 align:start position:0%
you need to be some this place at this
 
03:45:42.070 --> 03:45:42.080 align:start position:0%
time um and bring that knowledge
 
03:45:43.708 --> 03:45:43.718 align:start position:0%
together but I am not we're certainly
 
03:45:45.390 --> 03:45:45.400 align:start position:0%
not opposed to doing this as a committee
 
03:45:47.590 --> 03:45:47.600 align:start position:0%
and having people come in and and
 
03:45:49.788 --> 03:45:49.798 align:start position:0%
testify and work with the uh the
 
03:45:51.628 --> 03:45:51.638 align:start position:0%
committee to get the work done well
 
03:45:53.310 --> 03:45:53.320 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm I want to be very careful
 
03:45:55.230 --> 03:45:55.240 align:start position:0%
not to debate this with you you know
 
03:45:56.990 --> 03:45:57.000 align:start position:0%
because what I want to know is hear from
 
03:45:59.750 --> 03:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
you because I look at you as the expert
 
03:46:02.708 --> 03:46:02.718 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions for this
 
03:46:05.310 --> 03:46:05.320 align:start position:0%
witness I guess I have a question to to
 
03:46:07.230 --> 03:46:07.240 align:start position:0%
follow up on what representative Smith
 
03:46:09.830 --> 03:46:09.840 align:start position:0%
said I'm I'm I
 
03:46:14.628 --> 03:46:14.638 align:start position:0%
guess I I I agree with her proposal but
 
03:46:17.990 --> 03:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
I guess I might wonder if we if it if we
 
03:46:19.590 --> 03:46:19.600 align:start position:0%
shouldn't go a bit further and that and
 
03:46:22.628 --> 03:46:22.638 align:start position:0%
that is this as you may know there was a
 
03:46:25.590 --> 03:46:25.600 align:start position:0%
um there was apparently a
 
03:46:29.750 --> 03:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
similar commission Bill uh presented in
 
03:46:33.070 --> 03:46:33.080 align:start position:0%
2022 I guess and it passed the Senate
 
03:46:38.708 --> 03:46:38.718 align:start position:0%
but was voted itl in the house and two
 
03:46:40.548 --> 03:46:40.558 align:start position:0%
there were two criticisms if I
 
03:46:42.190 --> 03:46:42.200 align:start position:0%
understand correctly which resulted in
 
03:46:44.750 --> 03:46:44.760 align:start position:0%
the itl one was that the this as
 
03:46:46.230 --> 03:46:46.240 align:start position:0%
representative Smith pointed out this
 
03:46:47.548 --> 03:46:47.558 align:start position:0%
the the commission that was proposed
 
03:46:49.548 --> 03:46:49.558 align:start position:0%
back then was to be you know 20 members
 
03:46:53.830 --> 03:46:53.840 align:start position:0%
or 25 members and I think the the the
 
03:46:55.788 --> 03:46:55.798 align:start position:0%
house sort of felt why do we have to
 
03:46:58.270 --> 03:46:58.280 align:start position:0%
have a commission of that size but the
 
03:46:59.830 --> 03:46:59.840 align:start position:0%
second thing and this is the one I want
 
03:47:04.350 --> 03:47:04.360 align:start position:0%
to focus on is the the the flavor of the
 
03:47:07.830 --> 03:47:07.840 align:start position:0%
report back in 2022 seemed to
 
03:47:11.310 --> 03:47:11.320 align:start position:0%
be the look The the people that have the
 
03:47:14.430 --> 03:47:14.440 align:start position:0%
expertise in this are kind of out there
 
03:47:15.868 --> 03:47:15.878 align:start position:0%
there are people like you and people
 
03:47:17.310 --> 03:47:17.320 align:start position:0%
from the Attorney General's office and
 
03:47:20.230 --> 03:47:20.240 align:start position:0%
maybe the courts and whatever
 
03:47:23.030 --> 03:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
um why are we sort of starting this
 
03:47:25.910 --> 03:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
commission why doesn't it make sense
 
03:47:28.910 --> 03:47:28.920 align:start position:0%
for those of you who sort of are the
 
03:47:33.310 --> 03:47:33.320 align:start position:0%
experts to get together and give us a
 
03:47:36.310 --> 03:47:36.320 align:start position:0%
proposal give us a proposed Bill saying
 
03:47:38.470 --> 03:47:38.480 align:start position:0%
we should change the you know we should
 
03:47:40.390 --> 03:47:40.400 align:start position:0%
change the definition of insanity like
 
03:47:42.470 --> 03:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
in this way and we should change the
 
03:47:44.788 --> 03:47:44.798 align:start position:0%
definition of of or the procedures for
 
03:47:47.948 --> 03:47:47.958 align:start position:0%
restoring sanity in restoring competency
 
03:47:50.628 --> 03:47:50.638 align:start position:0%
in this way and we would then consider
 
03:47:53.310 --> 03:47:53.320 align:start position:0%
them I'm I'm just I'm just wondering if
 
03:47:57.230 --> 03:47:57.240 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't be a more efficient way to
 
03:48:00.190 --> 03:48:00.200 align:start position:0%
get what you want to get accomplished
 
03:48:02.948 --> 03:48:02.958 align:start position:0%
done more quickly now it's obviously
 
03:48:05.708 --> 03:48:05.718 align:start position:0%
it's too late to introduce new bill this
 
03:48:08.628 --> 03:48:08.638 align:start position:0%
year but um you know
 
03:48:11.190 --> 03:48:11.200 align:start position:0%
the we could certainly do it next year
 
03:48:13.510 --> 03:48:13.520 align:start position:0%
and if we had all that work done in
 
03:48:16.470 --> 03:48:16.480 align:start position:0%
advance um I'm I'm just you know
 
03:48:17.990 --> 03:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
wondering what your reaction would be to
 
03:48:20.430 --> 03:48:20.440 align:start position:0%
proceeding in that fashion well the as I
 
03:48:21.510 --> 03:48:21.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned the governor's commission
 
03:48:22.990 --> 03:48:23.000 align:start position:0%
subcommittee has been doing a lot of
 
03:48:25.830 --> 03:48:25.840 align:start position:0%
this work and and um I think attorney
 
03:48:27.430 --> 03:48:27.440 align:start position:0%
gry could answer questions about the
 
03:48:29.390 --> 03:48:29.400 align:start position:0%
work that they have done um I'm not a
 
03:48:31.190 --> 03:48:31.200 align:start position:0%
member of the committee Susan Stern sits
 
03:48:32.590 --> 03:48:32.600 align:start position:0%
on it for our
 
03:48:34.750 --> 03:48:34.760 align:start position:0%
organization um
 
03:48:37.548 --> 03:48:37.558 align:start position:0%
and I think the thought is that we
 
03:48:39.868 --> 03:48:39.878 align:start position:0%
really need buyin from legislators which
 
03:48:42.390 --> 03:48:42.400 align:start position:0%
is why we need them involved and sitting
 
03:48:44.510 --> 03:48:44.520 align:start position:0%
around the table discussing these ideas
 
03:48:47.310 --> 03:48:47.320 align:start position:0%
as well rather than just being handed a
 
03:48:49.430 --> 03:48:49.440 align:start position:0%
proposal and saying can you go forward
 
03:48:51.990 --> 03:48:52.000 align:start position:0%
with this um it really is important for
 
03:48:53.750 --> 03:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
us to have these discussions with the
 
03:48:56.670 --> 03:48:56.680 align:start position:0%
legislature um as well as behind closed
 
03:48:58.910 --> 03:48:58.920 align:start position:0%
doors with just the stakeholders all
 
03:49:02.110 --> 03:49:02.120 align:start position:0%
right other questions for this witness

to either break ground and then
 
03:49:12.670 --> 03:49:12.680 align:start position:0%
eventually open they've already broken
 
03:49:14.310 --> 03:49:14.320 align:start position:0%
ground on it and I believe it's supposed
 
03:49:16.430 --> 03:49:16.440 align:start position:0%
to open next
 
03:49:18.990 --> 03:49:19.000 align:start position:0%

advocating in my role as a professional
 
03:50:20.590 --> 03:50:20.600 align:start position:0%
forensic psychologist uh as part of that

can uh with my knowledge and position
 
03:50:36.110 --> 03:50:36.120 align:start position:0%
but I'm not here representing their
 
03:50:38.788 --> 03:50:38.798 align:start position:0%
interest uh I'm uh here to say that the
 
03:50:40.350 --> 03:50:40.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Psychological Association
 
03:50:43.190 --> 03:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
is in favor of House Bill
 
03:50:46.470 --> 03:50:46.480 align:start position:0%
1020 um I have been listening to the
 
03:50:47.910 --> 03:50:47.920 align:start position:0%
commentary from this committee and I
 
03:50:50.470 --> 03:50:50.480 align:start position:0%
very much appreciate the thoughtful and
 
03:50:53.470 --> 03:50:53.480 align:start position:0%
insightful nature of that commentary I
 
03:50:55.110 --> 03:50:55.120 align:start position:0%
defer to the experience of this
 
03:50:57.270 --> 03:50:57.280 align:start position:0%
Committee in understanding how best to
 
03:50:59.628 --> 03:50:59.638 align:start position:0%
get this work done my real Point here is
 
03:51:01.910 --> 03:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
to Advocate that this work needs to be
 
03:51:05.590 --> 03:51:05.600 align:start position:0%
done uh that the issues of Competency
 
03:51:08.110 --> 03:51:08.120 align:start position:0%
I've been working uh doing competency
 
03:51:10.948 --> 03:51:10.958 align:start position:0%
evaluations uh for eight and a half
 
03:51:14.190 --> 03:51:14.200 align:start position:0%
almost nine years now and this needed to
 
03:51:16.470 --> 03:51:16.480 align:start position:0%
get done when I first got here when I
 
03:51:17.948 --> 03:51:17.958 align:start position:0%
first got here it needed to get done 10
 
03:51:19.788 --> 03:51:19.798 align:start position:0%
years before that and it still needs to
 
03:51:21.868 --> 03:51:21.878 align:start position:0%
get done today uh the work here is
 
03:51:24.030 --> 03:51:24.040 align:start position:0%
urgent and I think part of the reason
 
03:51:26.030 --> 03:51:26.040 align:start position:0%
why I see that this bill is still
 
03:51:28.270 --> 03:51:28.280 align:start position:0%
forward and why I'm I'm advocating for
 
03:51:29.830 --> 03:51:29.840 align:start position:0%
it and my organization is advocating for
 
03:51:32.948 --> 03:51:32.958 align:start position:0%
it is because this bill will have
 
03:51:35.150 --> 03:51:35.160 align:start position:0%
realterm con consequences in terms of
 
03:51:37.670 --> 03:51:37.680 align:start position:0%
how competency gets handled in the state
 
03:51:39.030 --> 03:51:39.040 align:start position:0%
and how competency gets handled in the
 
03:51:40.910 --> 03:51:40.920 align:start position:0%
state will have real-term consequences
 
03:51:44.030 --> 03:51:44.040 align:start position:0%
for the thousands of individuals who U
 
03:51:46.868 --> 03:51:46.878 align:start position:0%
are put through the judicial system and
 
03:51:49.708 --> 03:51:49.718 align:start position:0%
who have mental health difficulties um
 
03:51:52.110 --> 03:51:52.120 align:start position:0%
specifically I I I also want to say I
 
03:51:54.590 --> 03:51:54.600 align:start position:0%
appreciate the the comment so far on
 
03:51:56.788 --> 03:51:56.798 align:start position:0%
this what I originally came here to
 
03:51:59.070 --> 03:51:59.080 align:start position:0%
advocate for was to add a name to the
 
03:52:01.310 --> 03:52:01.320 align:start position:0%
list and I realized given what you guys
 
03:52:02.910 --> 03:52:02.920 align:start position:0%
have said that that list me to get
 
03:52:04.910 --> 03:52:04.920 align:start position:0%
paired down the reason why I'm here
 
03:52:07.350 --> 03:52:07.360 align:start position:0%
advocating for adding one more name to
 
03:52:11.230 --> 03:52:11.240 align:start position:0%
this list is that the work in competency
 
03:52:13.948 --> 03:52:13.958 align:start position:0%
and in Insanity these evaluations are
 
03:52:16.510 --> 03:52:16.520 align:start position:0%
largely conducted by psychologists in
 
03:52:18.350 --> 03:52:18.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and so when I look at this
 
03:52:21.948 --> 03:52:21.958 align:start position:0%
list I see uh half a dozen attorneys I
 
03:52:24.390 --> 03:52:24.400 align:start position:0%
see administrators I see legislators I
 
03:52:28.070 --> 03:52:28.080 align:start position:0%
see one potential psychiatrist and no
 
03:52:30.670 --> 03:52:30.680 align:start position:0%
psychologists and so to me having
 
03:52:32.670 --> 03:52:32.680 align:start position:0%
somebody in the room for my profession
 
03:52:35.350 --> 03:52:35.360 align:start position:0%
that's why I'm here advocating today is
 
03:52:38.270 --> 03:52:38.280 align:start position:0%
to make sure that there are um Mental
 
03:52:39.788 --> 03:52:39.798 align:start position:0%
Health Providers and specifically a
 
03:52:42.190 --> 03:52:42.200 align:start position:0%
psychologist in the room for these
 
03:52:45.830 --> 03:52:45.840 align:start position:0%
discussions um I agree with uh attorney
 
03:52:48.030 --> 03:52:48.040 align:start position:0%
Stevens that it's important for there to
 
03:52:50.750 --> 03:52:50.760 align:start position:0%
be a lot of dialogue between legislative
 
03:52:53.430 --> 03:52:53.440 align:start position:0%
members and Professionals in this
 
03:52:57.430 --> 03:52:57.440 align:start position:0%
because uh these issues are difficult to
 
03:52:59.628 --> 03:52:59.638 align:start position:0%
understand there are a lot of confusions
 
03:53:01.628 --> 03:53:01.638 align:start position:0%
I can tell you that right now if you
 
03:53:03.310 --> 03:53:03.320 align:start position:0%
look at the statutes for competency
 
03:53:07.670 --> 03:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
which RSA 171 and RSA 171a I can point
 
03:53:09.390 --> 03:53:09.400 align:start position:0%
to you that as long as I've been here
 
03:53:11.868 --> 03:53:11.878 align:start position:0%
there has been competing language in the
 
03:53:13.670 --> 03:53:13.680 align:start position:0%
statutes where one statute says that the
 
03:53:15.590 --> 03:53:15.600 align:start position:0%
state has a burden and the other statute
 
03:53:18.590 --> 03:53:18.600 align:start position:0%
says that the defense has a burden and I
 
03:53:21.150 --> 03:53:21.160 align:start position:0%
have listened to judges listen listen to
 
03:53:22.830 --> 03:53:22.840 align:start position:0%
attorneys going back and forth about how
 
03:53:24.470 --> 03:53:24.480 align:start position:0%
these things should handle and those
 
03:53:27.190 --> 03:53:27.200 align:start position:0%
kinds of mistakes happen because there
 
03:53:28.990 --> 03:53:29.000 align:start position:0%
isn't this overall dialogue where all of
 
03:53:30.948 --> 03:53:30.958 align:start position:0%
the parties are in the room and so from
 
03:53:32.548 --> 03:53:32.558 align:start position:0%
my point of view that is the perspective
 
03:53:34.430 --> 03:53:34.440 align:start position:0%
of why a commission would be helpful in
 
03:53:36.510 --> 03:53:36.520 align:start position:0%
this case because it gets legislators in
 
03:53:38.390 --> 03:53:38.400 align:start position:0%
the room with the professionals who know
 
03:53:41.030 --> 03:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
about this information who have the
 
03:53:42.708 --> 03:53:42.718 align:start position:0%
solutions for this are not complicated
 
03:53:42.718 --> 03:53:43.548 align:start position:0%
solutions for this are not complicated
or

03:53:43.548 --> 03:53:43.558 align:start position:0%
or
 
03:53:47.310 --> 03:53:47.320 align:start position:0%
not um difficult to understand they are
 
03:53:49.788 --> 03:53:49.798 align:start position:0%
simply the solutions that exist
 
03:53:52.628 --> 03:53:52.638 align:start position:0%
that require everybody to be in the room
 
03:53:54.230 --> 03:53:54.240 align:start position:0%
at the same time and understand the
 
03:53:57.070 --> 03:53:57.080 align:start position:0%
stakes and understand uh what needs to
 
03:54:00.310 --> 03:54:00.320 align:start position:0%
happen uh with that said again I'm fully
 
03:54:02.350 --> 03:54:02.360 align:start position:0%
in favor of however you guys in your
 
03:54:05.350 --> 03:54:05.360 align:start position:0%
wisdom decide to have this process done
 
03:54:07.788 --> 03:54:07.798 align:start position:0%
I'll be in favor of it but my goal is
 
03:54:09.510 --> 03:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
one make sure that there is a
 
03:54:11.708 --> 03:54:11.718 align:start position:0%
psychologist preferably a forensic
 
03:54:14.150 --> 03:54:14.160 align:start position:0%
psychologist in the room when these
 
03:54:16.070 --> 03:54:16.080 align:start position:0%
things are being discussed and to that
 
03:54:17.590 --> 03:54:17.600 align:start position:0%
those discussions happen and that there
 
03:54:19.948 --> 03:54:19.958 align:start position:0%
is real change because we do need real
 
03:54:22.590 --> 03:54:22.600 align:start position:0%
change in our competency and Insanity uh

for taking my question so you were left
 
03:54:40.948 --> 03:54:40.958 align:start position:0%
off the list as a um forensic
 
03:54:43.030 --> 03:54:43.040 align:start position:0%
psychologist do you think that was just
 
03:54:45.430 --> 03:54:45.440 align:start position:0%
an oversight or do you think that
 
03:54:47.270 --> 03:54:47.280 align:start position:0%
conditions have changed like over the
 
03:54:49.190 --> 03:54:49.200 align:start position:0%
years to show that we really need a
 
03:54:53.708 --> 03:54:53.718 align:start position:0%
forensic um site person thank you uh I I
 
03:54:55.510 --> 03:54:55.520 align:start position:0%
I would attribute to oversight again I
 
03:54:58.868 --> 03:54:58.878 align:start position:0%
found that um you know I work with uh
 
03:55:00.590 --> 03:55:00.600 align:start position:0%
Folks at New Hampshire hospital I work
 
03:55:03.788 --> 03:55:03.798 align:start position:0%
with Folks at corrections I work with uh
 
03:55:06.230 --> 03:55:06.240 align:start position:0%
um uh folks in the
 
03:55:09.390 --> 03:55:09.400 align:start position:0%
Judiciary it's often difficult to
 
03:55:11.628 --> 03:55:11.638 align:start position:0%
understand the specifics of how this
 
03:55:14.830 --> 03:55:14.840 align:start position:0%
process occurs and and who's involved uh
 
03:55:16.910 --> 03:55:16.920 align:start position:0%
so I didn't I just assumed it was an
 
03:55:20.350 --> 03:55:20.360 align:start position:0%
oversight thank you other questions for
 
03:55:20.360 --> 03:55:22.670 align:start position:0%
oversight thank you other questions for
this

03:55:22.670 --> 03:55:22.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:25.670 --> 03:55:25.680 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you very much
 
03:55:32.390 --> 03:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:32.400 --> 03:55:38.708 align:start position:0%
 
KGAN

03:55:38.708 --> 03:55:38.718 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:41.110 --> 03:55:41.120 align:start position:0%
hi hello again Representatives I hope
 
03:55:43.830 --> 03:55:43.840 align:start position:0%
you're all doing well uh just appearing
 
03:55:46.470 --> 03:55:46.480 align:start position:0%
uh very briefly um from the judicial
 
03:55:48.548 --> 03:55:48.558 align:start position:0%
branch to say that I think that uh
 
03:55:50.150 --> 03:55:50.160 align:start position:0%
chairman Pearson gives us far too much
 
03:55:52.628 --> 03:55:52.638 align:start position:0%
credit on on his excellent work that he
 
03:55:55.670 --> 03:55:55.680 align:start position:0%
was doing with nami uh but it is a
 
03:55:57.590 --> 03:55:57.600 align:start position:0%
particular passion project for this
 
03:55:59.628 --> 03:55:59.638 align:start position:0%
chief justice and for those of us that
 
03:56:01.070 --> 03:56:01.080 align:start position:0%
are in leadership positions in the
 
03:56:02.990 --> 03:56:03.000 align:start position:0%
judicial branch to modernize our
 
03:56:05.350 --> 03:56:05.360 align:start position:0%
approach to mental health um the the
 
03:56:08.390 --> 03:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
form the participation the the scope of
 
03:56:10.590 --> 03:56:10.600 align:start position:0%
what's covered uh we would only offer
 
03:56:12.070 --> 03:56:12.080 align:start position:0%
that we are happy to be active and
 
03:56:14.350 --> 03:56:14.360 align:start position:0%
involved participants um in the limited
 
03:56:16.150 --> 03:56:16.160 align:start position:0%
role that the court has in this area
 
03:56:18.510 --> 03:56:18.520 align:start position:0%
there are many others to hear from uh
 
03:56:20.830 --> 03:56:20.840 align:start position:0%
but I wanted to express our our interest
 
03:56:22.590 --> 03:56:22.600 align:start position:0%
always in being Partners in modernizing
 
03:56:24.310 --> 03:56:24.320 align:start position:0%
the Court's approach to mental health
 
03:56:25.788 --> 03:56:25.798 align:start position:0%
regrettably the Chief Justice could not
 
03:56:28.030 --> 03:56:28.040 align:start position:0%
be here today but uh he did want me to
 
03:56:30.470 --> 03:56:30.480 align:start position:0%
convey that sentiment
 
03:56:34.628 --> 03:56:34.638 align:start position:0%
great question yes representative gson
 
03:56:36.390 --> 03:56:36.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony given that
 
03:56:39.070 --> 03:56:39.080 align:start position:0%
this is not a new issue evidently it's
 
03:56:40.390 --> 03:56:40.400 align:start position:0%
been around for at least nine years
 
03:56:43.350 --> 03:56:43.360 align:start position:0%
according to the previous uh person that
 
03:56:46.510 --> 03:56:46.520 align:start position:0%
testified what has been the greatest
 
03:56:49.750 --> 03:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
obstacle to getting this done to this
 
03:56:53.110 --> 03:56:53.120 align:start position:0%
point that here we are again with
 
03:56:55.190 --> 03:56:55.200 align:start position:0%
another bill another
 
03:56:56.830 --> 03:56:56.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity what what's been the
 
03:56:58.868 --> 03:56:58.878 align:start position:0%
greatest obstacle up to this point
 
03:57:00.270 --> 03:57:00.280 align:start position:0%
that's a great question and I I'm afraid
 
03:57:01.788 --> 03:57:01.798 align:start position:0%
I don't know the answer to it I think
 
03:57:02.990 --> 03:57:03.000 align:start position:0%
that some of the challenges in terms of
 
03:57:05.670 --> 03:57:05.680 align:start position:0%
the Court's application are receiving
 
03:57:07.708 --> 03:57:07.718 align:start position:0%
directive from the legislature on on
 
03:57:09.070 --> 03:57:09.080 align:start position:0%
what if anything you think should be
 
03:57:10.910 --> 03:57:10.920 align:start position:0%
done differently in the competency area
 
03:57:12.750 --> 03:57:12.760 align:start position:0%
we do have restorability hearings but
 
03:57:15.990 --> 03:57:16.000 align:start position:0%
there is room for more clarity uh
 
03:57:17.868 --> 03:57:17.878 align:start position:0%
instruction in terms of clinical
 
03:57:19.590 --> 03:57:19.600 align:start position:0%
approach I'm I'm sure that there are
 
03:57:21.070 --> 03:57:21.080 align:start position:0%
constantly more information that's being
 
03:57:22.590 --> 03:57:22.600 align:start position:0%
learned about the best way to handle
 
03:57:25.150 --> 03:57:25.160 align:start position:0%
these issues and to to ensure that the
 
03:57:27.430 --> 03:57:27.440 align:start position:0%
legislation is always reflecting those
 
03:57:29.430 --> 03:57:29.440 align:start position:0%
changes in science and medicine I think
 
03:57:31.788 --> 03:57:31.798 align:start position:0%
it's a challenge um the courts implement
 
03:57:33.868 --> 03:57:33.878 align:start position:0%
the laws that are written um so if the
 
03:57:35.590 --> 03:57:35.600 align:start position:0%
legislature wants to give us uh more
 
03:57:36.990 --> 03:57:37.000 align:start position:0%
updated Direction more specific
 
03:57:39.470 --> 03:57:39.480 align:start position:0%
direction we're always happy to receive
 
03:57:43.150 --> 03:57:43.160 align:start position:0%
that representative BR thank you in
 
03:57:46.590 --> 03:57:46.600 align:start position:0%
followup to that it seems like that
 
03:57:50.628 --> 03:57:50.638 align:start position:0%
whatever gets done needs to be able to
 
03:57:53.948 --> 03:57:53.958 align:start position:0%
adapt with time if definitions we have
 
03:57:55.230 --> 03:57:55.240 align:start position:0%
to be careful not changing them on a
 
03:57:59.390 --> 03:57:59.400 align:start position:0%
whim but to be able to uh make sure that
 
03:58:01.310 --> 03:58:01.320 align:start position:0%
the legislation can withstand some time
 
03:58:03.510 --> 03:58:03.520 align:start position:0%
and allow some flexibility in time time
 
03:58:05.270 --> 03:58:05.280 align:start position:0%
or whatever is necessary so that it
 
03:58:07.310 --> 03:58:07.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't become stale the moment it
 
03:58:07.320 --> 03:58:09.070 align:start position:0%
doesn't become stale the moment it
passes

03:58:09.070 --> 03:58:09.080 align:start position:0%
passes
 
03:58:13.948 --> 03:58:13.958 align:start position:0%
so is there a is there a way
 
03:58:18.030 --> 03:58:18.040 align:start position:0%
of accomplishing that through this
 
03:58:20.350 --> 03:58:20.360 align:start position:0%
commission is is I I don't see where
 
03:58:24.270 --> 03:58:24.280 align:start position:0%
that is uh a a part of this an objective
 
03:58:26.510 --> 03:58:26.520 align:start position:0%
of this commission or an objective of
 
03:58:29.190 --> 03:58:29.200 align:start position:0%
this legislation is to have a bill that
 
03:58:32.948 --> 03:58:32.958 align:start position:0%
does perpetuate in through time so I I I
 
03:58:34.390 --> 03:58:34.400 align:start position:0%
guess guess it's more of a statement
 
03:58:37.670 --> 03:58:37.680 align:start position:0%
than a a question but um is there any
 
03:58:41.708 --> 03:58:41.718 align:start position:0%
way that can actually be done legally or
 
03:58:44.150 --> 03:58:44.160 align:start position:0%
uh whatever I not sure how to formulate
 
03:58:46.430 --> 03:58:46.440 align:start position:0%
that in a question so I'll just punt for
 
03:58:48.830 --> 03:58:48.840 align:start position:0%
the rest of it Alex for $500 it's a it's
 
03:58:50.990 --> 03:58:51.000 align:start position:0%
a great question in some areas of law
 
03:58:53.350 --> 03:58:53.360 align:start position:0%
that's I think that's achieved very well
 
03:58:54.990 --> 03:58:55.000 align:start position:0%
and in others particularly ones dealing
 
03:58:56.430 --> 03:58:56.440 align:start position:0%
with science and technology that can be
 
03:58:58.150 --> 03:58:58.160 align:start position:0%
a tremendous challenge that it does have
 
03:58:59.628 --> 03:58:59.638 align:start position:0%
to be updated with more specific
 
03:59:02.030 --> 03:59:02.040 align:start position:0%
definitions as more is
 
03:59:05.750 --> 03:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:09.708 --> 03:59:09.718 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative Smith Mr
 
03:59:12.470 --> 03:59:12.480 align:start position:0%
chair it's up to you and I I don't have
 
03:59:14.708 --> 03:59:14.718 align:start position:0%
a question for the judicial branch this
 
03:59:17.150 --> 03:59:17.160 align:start position:0%
time but I wonder if it would be all
 
03:59:19.990 --> 03:59:20.000 align:start position:0%
right if I if with you if Miss Stevens
 
03:59:23.150 --> 03:59:23.160 align:start position:0%
could come back so that I could ask her
 
03:59:25.390 --> 03:59:25.400 align:start position:0%
a question oh of course yes of course
 
03:59:27.350 --> 03:59:27.360 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you any any other
 
03:59:29.070 --> 03:59:29.080 align:start position:0%
questions for this witness before I
 
03:59:31.190 --> 03:59:31.200 align:start position:0%
excuse great thank you very much and
 
03:59:39.270 --> 03:59:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:41.750 --> 03:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
thank you the you know the wheels grind
 
03:59:45.230 --> 03:59:45.240 align:start position:0%
slowly but they grind fine slowly is my
 
03:59:48.390 --> 03:59:48.400 align:start position:0%
brain I I knew I've been here done that
 
03:59:51.190 --> 03:59:51.200 align:start position:0%
and I thought I remembered but I did
 
03:59:54.830 --> 03:59:54.840 align:start position:0%
need to confer with the chair to help my
 
04:00:01.030 --> 04:00:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:03.510 --> 04:00:03.520 align:start position:0%
2022 um when
 
04:00:07.470 --> 04:00:07.480 align:start position:0%
a similar bill was before this committee
 
04:00:11.310 --> 04:00:11.320 align:start position:0%
um the majority everybody agrees about
 
04:00:14.150 --> 04:00:14.160 align:start position:0%
the need that's no question but the
 
04:00:15.628 --> 04:00:15.638 align:start position:0%
majority of the committee does not
 
04:00:17.510 --> 04:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
believe that a commission with over 20
 
04:00:20.070 --> 04:00:20.080 align:start position:0%
members is necessary to accomplish these
 
04:00:24.110 --> 04:00:24.120 align:start position:0%
tasks um first insanity and standards of
 
04:00:26.230 --> 04:00:26.240 align:start position:0%
Competency are two very different
 
04:00:28.230 --> 04:00:28.240 align:start position:0%
subjects the expertise needed to
 
04:00:30.310 --> 04:00:30.320 align:start position:0%
accomplish these studies is already
 
04:00:32.230 --> 04:00:32.240 align:start position:0%
available in the state agencies which
 
04:00:33.548 --> 04:00:33.558 align:start position:0%
address them
 
04:00:35.470 --> 04:00:35.480 align:start position:0%
the majority of the committee does not
 
04:00:37.350 --> 04:00:37.360 align:start position:0%
see the need for the commission when
 
04:00:40.310 --> 04:00:40.320 align:start position:0%
what may be needed is a
 
04:00:40.320 --> 04:00:42.110 align:start position:0%
what may be needed is a
departmental

04:00:42.110 --> 04:00:42.120 align:start position:0%
departmental
 
04:00:44.868 --> 04:00:44.878 align:start position:0%
proposal tell me what has changed in the
 
04:00:48.390 --> 04:00:48.400 align:start position:0%
two years since then so that here we are
 
04:00:48.400 --> 04:00:49.670 align:start position:0%
two years since then so that here we are
back

04:00:49.670 --> 04:00:49.680 align:start position:0%
back
 
04:00:53.590 --> 04:00:53.600 align:start position:0%
again not having collected
 
04:00:56.628 --> 04:00:56.638 align:start position:0%
$200 um on the Monopoly board but we're
 
04:00:56.638 --> 04:00:57.910 align:start position:0%
$200 um on the Monopoly board but we're
back

04:00:57.910 --> 04:00:57.920 align:start position:0%
back
 
04:01:01.310 --> 04:01:01.320 align:start position:0%
nonetheless at the same place has that
 
04:01:03.910 --> 04:01:03.920 align:start position:0%
group that had been meeting or not as
 
04:01:07.390 --> 04:01:07.400 align:start position:0%
the case may be not made any progress in
 
04:01:11.310 --> 04:01:11.320 align:start position:0%
the two years since the legislature
 
04:01:14.628 --> 04:01:14.638 align:start position:0%
asked the experts to solve the
 
04:01:18.190 --> 04:01:18.200 align:start position:0%
problem I know that the subcommittee
 
04:01:20.310 --> 04:01:20.320 align:start position:0%
looking at competency has been meeting
 
04:01:23.830 --> 04:01:23.840 align:start position:0%
regularly um and again
 
04:01:27.708 --> 04:01:27.718 align:start position:0%
I defer to attorney gry um around the
 
04:01:29.590 --> 04:01:29.600 align:start position:0%
work that's been done but there has been
 
04:01:32.190 --> 04:01:32.200 align:start position:0%
drafts of of bills that have been
 
04:01:33.868 --> 04:01:33.878 align:start position:0%
floated around
 
04:01:37.548 --> 04:01:37.558 align:start position:0%
um but again um with the work that has
 
04:01:39.270 --> 04:01:39.280 align:start position:0%
been done and there's been a lot of work
 
04:01:41.470 --> 04:01:41.480 align:start position:0%
that has been done which is why the
 
04:01:43.910 --> 04:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
decision to make this commission be the
 
04:01:46.430 --> 04:01:46.440 align:start position:0%
first report done in November and then
 
04:01:49.190 --> 04:01:49.200 align:start position:0%
the the final report done um a year from
 
04:01:51.548 --> 04:01:51.558 align:start position:0%
November that the commission could get
 
04:01:53.868 --> 04:01:53.878 align:start position:0%
the work done in that time because of
 
04:01:56.510 --> 04:01:56.520 align:start position:0%
the leg work that has been done thus far
 
04:01:58.868 --> 04:01:58.878 align:start position:0%
by the subcommittee of the governor's
 
04:02:01.390 --> 04:02:01.400 align:start position:0%
Commission of Mental Health and Justice
 
04:02:04.670 --> 04:02:04.680 align:start position:0%

you then uh I don't yeah I don't have
 
04:02:12.750 --> 04:02:12.760 align:start position:0%
another pink card but I have a feeling
 
04:02:13.948 --> 04:02:13.958 align:start position:0%
there's somebody else that wants to
 
04:02:15.990 --> 04:02:16.000 align:start position:0%
testify so is there somebody else that
 
04:02:21.868 --> 04:02:21.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:25.470 --> 04:02:25.480 align:start position:0%
1020 yes please come on up did did you I
 
04:02:27.030 --> 04:02:27.040 align:start position:0%
take it you didn't fill out a pink card
 
04:02:28.788 --> 04:02:28.798 align:start position:0%
I I didn't Mr chair and good afternoon
 
04:02:30.750 --> 04:02:30.760 align:start position:0%
members um I'm Assistant Attorney
 
04:02:32.270 --> 04:02:32.280 align:start position:0%
General Mike Grandy I'm I'm happy to
 
04:02:33.430 --> 04:02:33.440 align:start position:0%
answer question questions our office
 
04:02:35.750 --> 04:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
isn't taking a position on this but I am
 
04:02:37.350 --> 04:02:37.360 align:start position:0%
happy to speak to so the the first thing
 
04:02:38.628 --> 04:02:38.638 align:start position:0%
we need to do is have you before you
 
04:02:40.628 --> 04:02:40.638 align:start position:0%
leave please fill out a pin card okay
 
04:02:43.830 --> 04:02:43.840 align:start position:0%
we'll do so you know I guess I do have a
 
04:02:45.830 --> 04:02:45.840 align:start position:0%
qu really to follow up on on
 
04:02:48.350 --> 04:02:48.360 align:start position:0%
representative Smith's question I you
 
04:02:50.510 --> 04:02:50.520 align:start position:0%
know I'm not I'm not opposed
 
04:02:52.270 --> 04:02:52.280 align:start position:0%
particularly with with in the way
 
04:02:53.948 --> 04:02:53.958 align:start position:0%
representative Smith suggested of a
 
04:02:56.030 --> 04:02:56.040 align:start position:0%
smaller legislative committee I'm not at
 
04:02:59.030 --> 04:02:59.040 align:start position:0%
all opposed to that but I'm just
 
04:03:01.190 --> 04:03:01.200 align:start position:0%
wondering if that really even that is
 
04:03:03.190 --> 04:03:03.200 align:start position:0%
the most efficient way wouldn't it
 
04:03:07.948 --> 04:03:07.958 align:start position:0%
make more sense for for example the
 
04:03:10.270 --> 04:03:10.280 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office to just to
 
04:03:14.230 --> 04:03:14.240 align:start position:0%
draft you know proposed bills saying
 
04:03:16.430 --> 04:03:16.440 align:start position:0%
here's what and I understand it might
 
04:03:17.948 --> 04:03:17.958 align:start position:0%
this might be this is what the Attorney
 
04:03:20.190 --> 04:03:20.200 align:start position:0%
General's office think should happen now
 
04:03:22.788 --> 04:03:22.798 align:start position:0%
Nami and maybe the defense bar and all
 
04:03:24.910 --> 04:03:24.920 align:start position:0%
those other people may have you know may
 
04:03:26.990 --> 04:03:27.000 align:start position:0%
be ready to pick at that and say no it's
 
04:03:28.110 --> 04:03:28.120 align:start position:0%
got you got to change this you got to
 
04:03:31.990 --> 04:03:32.000 align:start position:0%
change that but my my thinking is that
 
04:03:33.350 --> 04:03:33.360 align:start position:0%
it would be
 
04:03:37.708 --> 04:03:37.718 align:start position:0%
better to have a document even if it's
 
04:03:39.548 --> 04:03:39.558 align:start position:0%
going to be changed because it can be
 
04:03:41.070 --> 04:03:41.080 align:start position:0%
you know it'll be criticized and could
 
04:03:43.190 --> 04:03:43.200 align:start position:0%
be changed
 
04:03:46.190 --> 04:03:46.200 align:start position:0%
then for this committee to sort of you
 
04:03:47.788 --> 04:03:47.798 align:start position:0%
know be formed and start from scratch
 
04:03:49.390 --> 04:03:49.400 align:start position:0%
and everybody will be sitting around
 
04:03:51.270 --> 04:03:51.280 align:start position:0%
saying one you know well we should do
 
04:03:52.510 --> 04:03:52.520 align:start position:0%
this and we should do this and we should
 
04:03:52.520 --> 04:03:53.350 align:start position:0%
this and we should do this and we should
do

04:03:53.350 --> 04:03:53.360 align:start position:0%
do
 
04:03:56.470 --> 04:03:56.480 align:start position:0%
this it just having been on these kind
 
04:03:59.510 --> 04:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
of commissions for a long time I uh I'm
 
04:04:02.628 --> 04:04:02.638 align:start position:0%
concerned that it'll take a lot longer
 
04:04:05.150 --> 04:04:05.160 align:start position:0%
to get to the point we want to get to
 
04:04:07.470 --> 04:04:07.480 align:start position:0%
than if we did it just by having your
 
04:04:10.110 --> 04:04:10.120 align:start position:0%
office submit a draft that can be you
 
04:04:10.120 --> 04:04:11.910 align:start position:0%
office submit a draft that can be you
know

04:04:11.910 --> 04:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
know
 
04:04:13.868 --> 04:04:13.878 align:start position:0%
changed um thank you Mr chair I'm not
 
04:04:14.830 --> 04:04:14.840 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that's the sort of thing
 
04:04:16.910 --> 04:04:16.920 align:start position:0%
that our office would necessarily do but
 
04:04:18.628 --> 04:04:18.638 align:start position:0%
I I will just sort of speak to some of
 
04:04:20.070 --> 04:04:20.080 align:start position:0%
the work that has happened on on the
 
04:04:22.190 --> 04:04:22.200 align:start position:0%
subcommittee that's been mentioned um so
 
04:04:25.030 --> 04:04:25.040 align:start position:0%
the governor's advisory Commission on uh
 
04:04:26.948 --> 04:04:26.958 align:start position:0%
mental illness in the correction system
 
04:04:31.190 --> 04:04:31.200 align:start position:0%
formed a subcommittee um to study uh
 
04:04:32.948 --> 04:04:32.958 align:start position:0%
competency regime in New Hampshire and
 
04:04:35.868 --> 04:04:35.878 align:start position:0%
potential uh updates or changes to it
 
04:04:37.190 --> 04:04:37.200 align:start position:0%
I'm the Attorney General's office
 
04:04:38.708 --> 04:04:38.718 align:start position:0%
designate on the governor's advisory
 
04:04:41.350 --> 04:04:41.360 align:start position:0%
commission and I chair the subcommittee
 
04:04:43.510 --> 04:04:43.520 align:start position:0%
um so in the last couple
 
04:04:46.750 --> 04:04:46.760 align:start position:0%
years um since the last similar bill um
 
04:04:48.548 --> 04:04:48.558 align:start position:0%
that subcommittee has been meeting uh
 
04:04:51.830 --> 04:04:51.840 align:start position:0%
mostly regularly um and has generated a
 
04:04:53.910 --> 04:04:53.920 align:start position:0%
lot of different concepts that are still
 
04:04:55.470 --> 04:04:55.480 align:start position:0%
internal to the subcommittee in the
 
04:04:56.788 --> 04:04:56.798 align:start position:0%
sense that they haven't been presented
 
04:04:58.670 --> 04:04:58.680 align:start position:0%
to the governor's advisory commission um
 
04:05:01.030 --> 04:05:01.040 align:start position:0%
it has included some draft legislative
 
04:05:03.070 --> 04:05:03.080 align:start position:0%
language um
 
04:05:05.788 --> 04:05:05.798 align:start position:0%
and the subcommittee uh within the last
 
04:05:08.070 --> 04:05:08.080 align:start position:0%
several months took a vote to support
 
04:05:11.030 --> 04:05:11.040 align:start position:0%
the uh this bill or or or a proposal by
 
04:05:13.070 --> 04:05:13.080 align:start position:0%
Nami to put forward a bill of this
 
04:05:15.910 --> 04:05:15.920 align:start position:0%
nature um because some of the
 
04:05:18.548 --> 04:05:18.558 align:start position:0%
intricacies uh that exist really
 
04:05:20.868 --> 04:05:20.878 align:start position:0%
necessitated having something that that
 
04:05:24.070 --> 04:05:24.080 align:start position:0%
um would be formal uh formally formed by
 
04:05:26.150 --> 04:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
this body and have kind of the you know
 
04:05:28.990 --> 04:05:29.000 align:start position:0%
the formal imprint to get all of the
 
04:05:30.948 --> 04:05:30.958 align:start position:0%
necessary stakeholders to truly get
 
04:05:32.750 --> 04:05:32.760 align:start position:0%
together and hash out the final details
 
04:05:36.910 --> 04:05:36.920 align:start position:0%
and that that work is difficult um for
 
04:05:37.910 --> 04:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
or has been difficult for the
 
04:05:39.990 --> 04:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
subcommittee to to run down so I would
 
04:05:42.230 --> 04:05:42.240 align:start position:0%
put it this way a lot of progress has
 
04:05:44.470 --> 04:05:44.480 align:start position:0%
been made from the perspective of the
 
04:05:46.868 --> 04:05:46.878 align:start position:0%
subcommittee there are some issues that
 
04:05:48.750 --> 04:05:48.760 align:start position:0%
that the subcommittee feels
 
04:05:52.190 --> 04:05:52.200 align:start position:0%
necessitate uh formal meetings with
 
04:05:55.430 --> 04:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
final stakeholders um that can't or
 
04:05:56.830 --> 04:05:56.840 align:start position:0%
haven't been able to have been hashed
 
04:05:59.670 --> 04:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
out at the subcommittee meeting so far
 
04:06:02.628 --> 04:06:02.638 align:start position:0%
and it from from the perspective of the
 
04:06:04.150 --> 04:06:04.160 align:start position:0%
subcommittee I think it it wouldn't be
 
04:06:05.750 --> 04:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
starting from scratch there is it would
 
04:06:08.270 --> 04:06:08.280 align:start position:0%
be starting much closer to the finish
 
04:06:10.510 --> 04:06:10.520 align:start position:0%
line but but really just needing to
 
04:06:10.520 --> 04:06:11.948 align:start position:0%
line but but really just needing to
finalize

04:06:11.948 --> 04:06:11.958 align:start position:0%
finalize
 
04:06:14.948 --> 04:06:14.958 align:start position:0%
aspects okay all right other other
 
04:06:17.350 --> 04:06:17.360 align:start position:0%
questions for this witness and I'm and I
 
04:06:18.750 --> 04:06:18.760 align:start position:0%
you know I'm sorry I know I I started
 
04:06:20.030 --> 04:06:20.040 align:start position:0%
off really by asking you a question if
 
04:06:22.190 --> 04:06:22.200 align:start position:0%
there's other things I didn't want to in
 
04:06:23.708 --> 04:06:23.718 align:start position:0%
any way preclude your testimony if
 
04:06:24.948 --> 04:06:24.958 align:start position:0%

04:08:30.948 --> 04:08:30.958 align:start position:0%
me with the testimony and can fill in
 
04:08:32.708 --> 04:08:32.718 align:start position:0%
the specifics about the impact of the
 
04:08:35.990 --> 04:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
law the way it is today um it what it is
 
04:08:37.868 --> 04:08:37.878 align:start position:0%
is a technical fix to the uh
 
04:08:39.430 --> 04:08:39.440 align:start position:0%
professional limited liability
 
04:08:44.070 --> 04:08:44.080 align:start position:0%
corporation uh law that exists today um
 
04:08:45.868 --> 04:08:45.878 align:start position:0%
just to clarify professional limited
 
04:08:48.788 --> 04:08:48.798 align:start position:0%
liability corporations are
 
04:08:51.270 --> 04:08:51.280 align:start position:0%
organizations uh where the members must
 
04:08:54.110 --> 04:08:54.120 align:start position:0%
be licensed in the profession to which
 
04:08:57.910 --> 04:08:57.920 align:start position:0%
the uh limited liability Corporation um
 
04:09:01.708 --> 04:09:01.718 align:start position:0%
uh operates uh all managers of the
 
04:09:03.430 --> 04:09:03.440 align:start position:0%
organiz gation directors of the
 
04:09:05.708 --> 04:09:05.718 align:start position:0%
organization must be under current
 
04:09:09.430 --> 04:09:09.440 align:start position:0%
license in order to serve um
 
04:09:13.510 --> 04:09:13.520 align:start position:0%
so excuse me so the um I just wanted to
 
04:09:15.910 --> 04:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
clarify this really doesn't impact lure
 
04:09:18.230 --> 04:09:18.240 align:start position:0%
or anything to do with lure uh the
 
04:09:21.230 --> 04:09:21.240 align:start position:0%
licensure is only a requirement to serve
 
04:09:23.990 --> 04:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
uh as a director a member of the of the
 
04:09:26.708 --> 04:09:26.718 align:start position:0%
corporation itself um and the the reason
 
04:09:29.470 --> 04:09:29.480 align:start position:0%
that this uh uh change is
 
04:09:33.030 --> 04:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
proposed is primarily due to solo
 
04:09:37.110 --> 04:09:37.120 align:start position:0%
practice um organizations which um are
 
04:09:38.948 --> 04:09:38.958 align:start position:0%
you know increasingly few but still
 
04:09:40.830 --> 04:09:40.840 align:start position:0%
exist and are still very much of a a
 
04:09:44.150 --> 04:09:44.160 align:start position:0%
valued part of the um the landscape of
 
04:09:49.470 --> 04:09:49.480 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire um the uh the
 
04:09:51.548 --> 04:09:51.558 align:start position:0%
difficulty with being a solo practice
 
04:09:52.670 --> 04:09:52.680 align:start position:0%
and I should say there's a whole range
 
04:09:54.070 --> 04:09:54.080 align:start position:0%
of professional practices that are
 
04:09:57.910 --> 04:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
covered by pcc's um uh my my um
 
04:09:59.310 --> 04:09:59.320 align:start position:0%
constituent here is part of the
 
04:10:02.430 --> 04:10:02.440 align:start position:0%
veterinary um Community um but there are
 
04:10:05.628 --> 04:10:05.638 align:start position:0%
others uh if the person if the solo
 
04:10:08.230 --> 04:10:08.240 align:start position:0%
person in the organization um that is
 
04:10:11.150 --> 04:10:11.160 align:start position:0%
licensed uh somehow becomes not what's
 
04:10:14.070 --> 04:10:14.080 align:start position:0%
called a qualified person um then they
 
04:10:16.110 --> 04:10:16.120 align:start position:0%
are no longer eligible to direct that
 
04:10:18.990 --> 04:10:19.000 align:start position:0%
organization pretty much immediately um
 
04:10:21.470 --> 04:10:21.480 align:start position:0%
and that can be something irreconcilable
 
04:10:24.548 --> 04:10:24.558 align:start position:0%
like they pass away um or they become
 
04:10:26.548 --> 04:10:26.558 align:start position:0%
mentally incapacitated or they could
 
04:10:28.470 --> 04:10:28.480 align:start position:0%
lose their lure in any of those
 
04:10:30.590 --> 04:10:30.600 align:start position:0%
instances they lose their ability to
 
04:10:33.350 --> 04:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
serve uh as the director of that
 
04:10:37.510 --> 04:10:37.520 align:start position:0%
organization um the in order to do any
 
04:10:41.270 --> 04:10:41.280 align:start position:0%
sort of corporate uh planning this
 
04:10:43.788 --> 04:10:43.798 align:start position:0%
requires that
 
04:10:47.030 --> 04:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
um that individual form some sort of
 
04:10:49.788 --> 04:10:49.798 align:start position:0%
relationship with another professional
 
04:10:52.750 --> 04:10:52.760 align:start position:0%
within their field that is not um not
 
04:10:55.230 --> 04:10:55.240 align:start position:0%
technically part of their organization
 
04:10:58.350 --> 04:10:58.360 align:start position:0%
um to be able to be listed as as you
 
04:11:01.470 --> 04:11:01.480 align:start position:0%
know a a manager um in the event of this
 
04:11:04.628 --> 04:11:04.638 align:start position:0%
the circum so what we're proposing is um
 
04:11:05.990 --> 04:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
a change to the
 
04:11:09.548 --> 04:11:09.558 align:start position:0%
law that would allow there to be an
 
04:11:12.548 --> 04:11:12.558 align:start position:0%
assistant manager named who is just one
 
04:11:14.510 --> 04:11:14.520 align:start position:0%
individual that is not a member of the
 
04:11:17.910 --> 04:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
licensed um profession and the purpose
 
04:11:19.310 --> 04:11:19.320 align:start position:0%
of this would not be that they could
 
04:11:22.150 --> 04:11:22.160 align:start position:0%
carry on business of the organization in
 
04:11:25.190 --> 04:11:25.200 align:start position:0%
a professional capacity um but more that
 
04:11:27.830 --> 04:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
they could manage the the business
 
04:11:29.868 --> 04:11:29.878 align:start position:0%
either the sale the dissolution the
 
04:11:33.030 --> 04:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
conversion of that Corporation um in the
 
04:11:35.430 --> 04:11:35.440 align:start position:0%
event that the that the um qualified
 
04:11:38.150 --> 04:11:38.160 align:start position:0%
person is no longer able to to do that
 
04:11:40.230 --> 04:11:40.240 align:start position:0%
um It's Time limited it allows them only
 
04:11:44.110 --> 04:11:44.120 align:start position:0%
to serve in that capacity for a year um
 
04:11:46.110 --> 04:11:46.120 align:start position:0%
and again it doesn't uh they could they
 
04:11:48.190 --> 04:11:48.200 align:start position:0%
could exercise all the rights corporate
 
04:11:49.750 --> 04:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
rights that the manager had but they
 
04:11:51.430 --> 04:11:51.440 align:start position:0%
could not exercise the professional
 
04:11:54.670 --> 04:11:54.680 align:start position:0%
rights that the manager had um so it's
 
04:11:58.070 --> 04:11:58.080 align:start position:0%
really uh just avoids anyone in that
 
04:12:00.350 --> 04:12:00.360 align:start position:0%
situation from having to operate you
 
04:12:02.270 --> 04:12:02.280 align:start position:0%
know with someone hopefully there you
 
04:12:03.868 --> 04:12:03.878 align:start position:0%
know people in their profession that
 
04:12:05.190 --> 04:12:05.200 align:start position:0%
they trust but it's an awkward
 
04:12:07.628 --> 04:12:07.638 align:start position:0%
relationship it requires a lot of trust
 
04:12:09.868 --> 04:12:09.878 align:start position:0%
and it's a it's a fairly significant ask
 
04:12:12.670 --> 04:12:12.680 align:start position:0%
for somebody if you become disqualified
 
04:12:14.948 --> 04:12:14.958 align:start position:0%
to basically take over the entire
 
04:12:16.788 --> 04:12:16.798 align:start position:0%
process of running and and dissolving
 
04:12:20.030 --> 04:12:20.040 align:start position:0%
your your organization or selling it so
 
04:12:22.150 --> 04:12:22.160 align:start position:0%
that's that's all I'm going to say again
 
04:12:25.350 --> 04:12:25.360 align:start position:0%
um Roger gow is here um and he can fill
 
04:12:28.590 --> 04:12:28.600 align:start position:0%
in the details behind this from a a a
 
04:12:32.230 --> 04:12:32.240 align:start position:0%
lived perspective I'll call it um but uh
 
04:12:35.390 --> 04:12:35.400 align:start position:0%
glad to take any questions all right qu
 
04:12:37.788 --> 04:12:37.798 align:start position:0%
yes question representative Manos thank
 
04:12:39.910 --> 04:12:39.920 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
04:12:44.430 --> 04:12:44.440 align:start position:0%
question um I am confused because it
 
04:12:47.150 --> 04:12:47.160 align:start position:0%
says each manager of a professional
 
04:12:50.350 --> 04:12:50.360 align:start position:0%
limited liability company if any and all
 
04:12:53.270 --> 04:12:53.280 align:start position:0%
the officers if any other than the
 
04:12:55.628 --> 04:12:55.638 align:start position:0%
secretary or an assistant secretary and
 
04:12:58.628 --> 04:12:58.638 align:start position:0%
the treasurer or an assistant Treasurer
 
04:13:00.910 --> 04:13:00.920 align:start position:0%
or the assistant manager in the case of
 
04:13:02.590 --> 04:13:02.600 align:start position:0%
a single member
 
04:13:06.868 --> 04:13:06.878 align:start position:0%
pllc shall be qualified persons so as I
 
04:13:11.830 --> 04:13:11.840 align:start position:0%
read that it sounds like um the
 
04:13:14.548 --> 04:13:14.558 align:start position:0%
assistant manager does not need to be a
 
04:13:16.788 --> 04:13:16.798 align:start position:0%
member of the professional of the
 
04:13:20.350 --> 04:13:20.360 align:start position:0%
profession that forms the
 
04:13:23.868 --> 04:13:23.878 align:start position:0%
LLC so so my my understanding of what
 
04:13:25.430 --> 04:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
that of what's written there is that all
 
04:13:28.030 --> 04:13:28.040 align:start position:0%
of those individuals do have to be um
 
04:13:30.070 --> 04:13:30.080 align:start position:0%
qualified persons in order in order to
 
04:13:32.750 --> 04:13:32.760 align:start position:0%
serve in that profession I I you know
 
04:13:34.590 --> 04:13:34.600 align:start position:0%
again uh that was my understanding of
 
04:13:38.230 --> 04:13:38.240 align:start position:0%
the way that that that is structured
 
04:13:40.310 --> 04:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
currently may I have a followup of
 
04:13:42.590 --> 04:13:42.600 align:start position:0%
course yes so so that was your intent
 
04:13:46.270 --> 04:13:46.280 align:start position:0%
that that the um that the assistant
 
04:13:48.628 --> 04:13:48.638 align:start position:0%
manager in the case of a single member
 
04:13:52.070 --> 04:13:52.080 align:start position:0%
pllc be a member of the
 
04:13:53.990 --> 04:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
profession that that the assistant
 
04:13:56.470 --> 04:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
manager in this in this in this modified
 
04:13:58.990 --> 04:13:59.000 align:start position:0%
bill would not need to be a a member of
 
04:14:00.150 --> 04:14:00.160 align:start position:0%
the profession sorry if I'm
 
04:14:02.030 --> 04:14:02.040 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding the original question
 
04:14:04.230 --> 04:14:04.240 align:start position:0%
that the only change to the existing law
 
04:14:05.470 --> 04:14:05.480 align:start position:0%
I think most of what you're reading is
 
04:14:07.830 --> 04:14:07.840 align:start position:0%
in the current statute the only change
 
04:14:11.910 --> 04:14:11.920 align:start position:0%
is the Bold section um uh you know or
 
04:14:13.590 --> 04:14:13.600 align:start position:0%
the assistant manager in the case of a
 
04:14:15.070 --> 04:14:15.080 align:start position:0%
single member Prof oh I see what you're
 
04:14:17.750 --> 04:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
saying because that's um that's the
 
04:14:20.070 --> 04:14:20.080 align:start position:0%
change sorry I see what you're saying
 
04:14:22.230 --> 04:14:22.240 align:start position:0%
now and and it's making more sense so
 
04:14:24.430 --> 04:14:24.440 align:start position:0%
you know it adds the the role of
 
04:14:26.150 --> 04:14:26.160 align:start position:0%
assistant manager to the list of
 
04:14:28.990 --> 04:14:29.000 align:start position:0%
possible roles um so someone could be
 
04:14:32.830 --> 04:14:32.840 align:start position:0%
assistant manager in the current rule
 
04:14:37.110 --> 04:14:37.120 align:start position:0%
without the the exemption from being a a
 
04:14:39.350 --> 04:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
uh licensed professional so at first
 
04:14:41.868 --> 04:14:41.878 align:start position:0%
establishes that concept of an assistant
 
04:14:44.110 --> 04:14:44.120 align:start position:0%
manager and that first modification and
 
04:14:47.910 --> 04:14:47.920 align:start position:0%
then down below basically uh creates the
 
04:14:51.628 --> 04:14:51.638 align:start position:0%
exemption from it so yeah I if I'm
 
04:14:52.548 --> 04:14:52.558 align:start position:0%
understanding that right and I'm
 
04:14:54.510 --> 04:14:54.520 align:start position:0%
representing this correctly I think that
 
04:14:56.230 --> 04:14:56.240 align:start position:0%
that's why that's in there the way it is
 
04:14:57.670 --> 04:14:57.680 align:start position:0%
where you read it and then again down
 
04:15:00.030 --> 04:15:00.040 align:start position:0%
below okay so I'm still a little
 
04:15:03.270 --> 04:15:03.280 align:start position:0%
confused the assist manager that's being
 
04:15:05.310 --> 04:15:05.320 align:start position:0%
added would need to be a member of the
 
04:15:06.990 --> 04:15:07.000 align:start position:0%
profession or would not need to be a
 
04:15:08.788 --> 04:15:08.798 align:start position:0%
member of the profession in the first
 
04:15:10.628 --> 04:15:10.638 align:start position:0%
instance yes so where the where it's
 
04:15:12.470 --> 04:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
added in that first sentence would need
 
04:15:14.670 --> 04:15:14.680 align:start position:0%
to be a member of the profession so it's
 
04:15:16.350 --> 04:15:16.360 align:start position:0%
essentially creating a new role within
 
04:15:19.470 --> 04:15:19.480 align:start position:0%
the organization that could be occupied
 
04:15:21.670 --> 04:15:21.680 align:start position:0%
by somebody who is a member of the
 
04:15:23.590 --> 04:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
profession and then down below allows
 
04:15:25.868 --> 04:15:25.878 align:start position:0%
just that particular role to be occupied
 
04:15:28.670 --> 04:15:28.680 align:start position:0%
by somebody who's not how can the same
 
04:15:30.150 --> 04:15:30.160 align:start position:0%
person both be a member of the
 
04:15:31.948 --> 04:15:31.958 align:start position:0%
profession and not be a member of well
 
04:15:32.990 --> 04:15:33.000 align:start position:0%
in other words in two different
 
04:15:35.110 --> 04:15:35.120 align:start position:0%
organizations so one organization could
 
04:15:37.430 --> 04:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
assign an assistant manager who is say
 
04:15:37.440 --> 04:15:38.350 align:start position:0%
assign an assistant manager who is say
another

04:15:38.350 --> 04:15:38.360 align:start position:0%
another
 
04:15:40.830 --> 04:15:40.840 align:start position:0%
veterinarian um so it doesn't preclude
 
04:15:42.750 --> 04:15:42.760 align:start position:0%
that it's just the the concept of an
 
04:15:45.590 --> 04:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
assistant manager wasn't existing in the
 
04:15:47.270 --> 04:15:47.280 align:start position:0%
law so so I should have mentioned that
 
04:15:50.510 --> 04:15:50.520 align:start position:0%
that that writes that in as as a role
 
04:15:52.350 --> 04:15:52.360 align:start position:0%
and then basically allows just that one
 
04:15:55.270 --> 04:15:55.280 align:start position:0%
role to be occupied by somebody who's
 
04:15:57.708 --> 04:15:57.718 align:start position:0%
not a member of the profession but it
 
04:16:00.430 --> 04:16:00.440 align:start position:0%
does not require that that person not be
 
04:16:03.590 --> 04:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:05.070 --> 04:16:05.080 align:start position:0%
in other words it doesn't open up all
 
04:16:06.830 --> 04:16:06.840 align:start position:0%
the leadership roles of the profession
 
04:16:09.788 --> 04:16:09.798 align:start position:0%
to a non-qualified person it only open
 
04:16:12.310 --> 04:16:12.320 align:start position:0%
one person does not have to be a member
 
04:16:15.390 --> 04:16:15.400 align:start position:0%
of the profession correct okay right for
 
04:16:18.150 --> 04:16:18.160 align:start position:0%
one yeah for one year right
 
04:16:21.350 --> 04:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
okay other questions for representative
 
04:16:24.190 --> 04:16:24.200 align:start position:0%
CH representative Wallace yes thank you
 
04:16:25.270 --> 04:16:25.280 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for taking my
 
04:16:27.948 --> 04:16:27.958 align:start position:0%
question um overall I like the idea of
 
04:16:30.110 --> 04:16:30.120 align:start position:0%
this particular bill seems like would
 
04:16:31.910 --> 04:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
provide some relief in these particular
 
04:16:34.868 --> 04:16:34.878 align:start position:0%
situations one question though um on
 
04:16:38.590 --> 04:16:38.600 align:start position:0%
line 11 um would it not make sense that
 
04:16:40.868 --> 04:16:40.878 align:start position:0%
um instead of leaving that open for up
 
04:16:43.788 --> 04:16:43.798 align:start position:0%
to a year some type of a modification
 
04:16:47.150 --> 04:16:47.160 align:start position:0%
such that uh the assistant manager May
 
04:16:49.788 --> 04:16:49.798 align:start position:0%
for appeared up to up to one year or
 
04:16:52.030 --> 04:16:52.040 align:start position:0%
until another qualified manager could be
 
04:16:54.070 --> 04:16:54.080 align:start position:0%
appointed whichever is
 
04:16:56.788 --> 04:16:56.798 align:start position:0%
shorter because absent that language
 
04:16:58.070 --> 04:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
you'd almost have to leave that
 
04:17:01.150 --> 04:17:01.160 align:start position:0%
assistant manager in that role until all
 
04:17:03.788 --> 04:17:03.798 align:start position:0%
matter were settled um yeah I I think
 
04:17:04.948 --> 04:17:04.958 align:start position:0%
the I think the inclusion of the
 
04:17:07.190 --> 04:17:07.200 align:start position:0%
language for up to a year was meant to
 
04:17:10.830 --> 04:17:10.840 align:start position:0%
sort of achieve that means but I I I
 
04:17:12.430 --> 04:17:12.440 align:start position:0%
don't I mean from my own perspective
 
04:17:14.590 --> 04:17:14.600 align:start position:0%
would not think that what I think you're
 
04:17:16.750 --> 04:17:16.760 align:start position:0%
suggesting is the whichever shorter
 
04:17:18.910 --> 04:17:18.920 align:start position:0%
language would be another way or maybe a
 
04:17:20.190 --> 04:17:20.200 align:start position:0%
clearer way to say it if you think
 
04:17:20.200 --> 04:17:22.270 align:start position:0%
clearer way to say it if you think
that's

04:17:22.270 --> 04:17:22.280 align:start position:0%
that's
 
04:17:25.548 --> 04:17:25.558 align:start position:0%
needed okay right other question to
 
04:17:27.948 --> 04:17:27.958 align:start position:0%
share yes representative you up thank
 
04:17:29.390 --> 04:17:29.400 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
04:17:31.390 --> 04:17:31.400 align:start position:0%
question representative Tor you know I'm
 
04:17:32.910 --> 04:17:32.920 align:start position:0%
I'm a little bit confused because when I
 
04:17:35.230 --> 04:17:35.240 align:start position:0%
read the bill the first line it says
 
04:17:37.868 --> 04:17:37.878 align:start position:0%
this bill amends the law to permit a
 
04:17:39.628 --> 04:17:39.638 align:start position:0%
single member professional limited
 
04:17:42.390 --> 04:17:42.400 align:start position:0%
liability company to designate an an
 
04:17:44.430 --> 04:17:44.440 align:start position:0%
assistant manager but you know reading
 
04:17:46.510 --> 04:17:46.520 align:start position:0%
it I was getting very confused because
 
04:17:50.948 --> 04:17:50.958 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say that the head of the pllc
 
04:17:54.628 --> 04:17:54.638 align:start position:0%
is the current manager so it's sort of
 
04:17:56.708 --> 04:17:56.718 align:start position:0%
like you know we're not calling them the
 
04:17:58.590 --> 04:17:58.600 align:start position:0%
manager we're just calling
 
04:18:02.350 --> 04:18:02.360 align:start position:0%
them single member professional
 
04:18:05.030 --> 04:18:05.040 align:start position:0%
yeah in other part of the RSA I believe
 
04:18:08.868 --> 04:18:08.878 align:start position:0%
uh this this is just the part about um
 
04:18:12.470 --> 04:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
uh the section 12 is part of
 
04:18:16.430 --> 04:18:16.440 align:start position:0%
304d um that and I could open it I have
 
04:18:18.868 --> 04:18:18.878 align:start position:0%
it open on one of my other screens that
 
04:18:24.230 --> 04:18:24.240 align:start position:0%
is the section definition um so 304 D1
 
04:18:25.910 --> 04:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
sort of talks about the different types
 
04:18:29.590 --> 04:18:29.600 align:start position:0%
of of uh professions that are covered
 
04:18:32.150 --> 04:18:32.160 align:start position:0%
and then D12
 
04:18:33.868 --> 04:18:33.878 align:start position:0%
is officers and
 
04:18:33.878 --> 04:18:36.788 align:start position:0%
is officers and
managers

04:18:36.788 --> 04:18:36.798 align:start position:0%
managers
 
04:18:39.070 --> 04:18:39.080 align:start position:0%
um so it just basically says each
 
04:18:40.670 --> 04:18:40.680 align:start position:0%
manager of the professional limited
 
04:18:43.190 --> 04:18:43.200 align:start position:0%
liability Corporation and if any all
 
04:18:45.510 --> 04:18:45.520 align:start position:0%
officers um and then it lists out the
 
04:18:47.830 --> 04:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
other ones um will be qualified person
 
04:18:50.628 --> 04:18:50.638 align:start position:0%
so it says that the whoever it is that's
 
04:18:52.310 --> 04:18:52.320 align:start position:0%
the that's the manager of the
 
04:18:54.110 --> 04:18:54.120 align:start position:0%
organization has currently to be a
 
04:18:56.868 --> 04:18:56.878 align:start position:0%
qualified professional and this does not
 
04:18:59.310 --> 04:18:59.320 align:start position:0%
allow a non-qualified person to take
 
04:19:03.110 --> 04:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
that role may have follow up yes okay so
 
04:19:05.390 --> 04:19:05.400 align:start position:0%
but we're not saying that the single
 
04:19:08.948 --> 04:19:08.958 align:start position:0%
member professional the owner of the LLC
 
04:19:12.270 --> 04:19:12.280 align:start position:0%
a pllc is the m current manager so it
 
04:19:16.548 --> 04:19:16.558 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:18.670 --> 04:19:18.680 align:start position:0%
off I'm struggling a little to figure
 
04:19:20.948 --> 04:19:20.958 align:start position:0%
out so I mean the the the manager would
 
04:19:24.270 --> 04:19:24.280 align:start position:0%
be the you know one of the named ENT
 
04:19:27.350 --> 04:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
named entities that that's uh leadership
 
04:19:30.150 --> 04:19:30.160 align:start position:0%
I I don't know that the term owner
 
04:19:32.708 --> 04:19:32.718 align:start position:0%
versus like manager are interchangeable
 
04:19:36.270 --> 04:19:36.280 align:start position:0%
that may be over my my uh non- lawyerly
 
04:19:38.948 --> 04:19:38.958 align:start position:0%
grade here in terms of of whether or not
 
04:19:42.868 --> 04:19:42.878 align:start position:0%
ownership and being the manager are are
 
04:19:46.110 --> 04:19:46.120 align:start position:0%
uh synonymous or not but the the person
 
04:19:48.548 --> 04:19:48.558 align:start position:0%
who is the manager would have to be a
 
04:19:51.070 --> 04:19:51.080 align:start position:0%
member of of the profession and
 
04:19:52.910 --> 04:19:52.920 align:start position:0%
currently all the other sort of
 
04:19:54.708 --> 04:19:54.718 align:start position:0%
directors of the organization would have
 
04:19:57.350 --> 04:19:57.360 align:start position:0%
to be would have to be members so so
 
04:20:00.150 --> 04:20:00.160 align:start position:0%
this just basically creates a new role
 
04:20:03.788 --> 04:20:03.798 align:start position:0%
with an exception thank you yeah other
 
04:20:05.430 --> 04:20:05.440 align:start position:0%
question yes representative
 
04:20:07.590 --> 04:20:07.600 align:start position:0%
Stapleton thank you Mr chair thank you
 
04:20:09.948 --> 04:20:09.958 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I'm still
 
04:20:13.948 --> 04:20:13.958 align:start position:0%
confused but is is the purpose of
 
04:20:18.350 --> 04:20:18.360 align:start position:0%
this when when the um primary qualified
 
04:20:21.190 --> 04:20:21.200 align:start position:0%
person um dies or is
 
04:20:24.270 --> 04:20:24.280 align:start position:0%
disqualified is for that assistant
 
04:20:29.310 --> 04:20:29.320 align:start position:0%
manager to um either um merge
 
04:20:33.310 --> 04:20:33.320 align:start position:0%
close um the business uh within the year
 
04:20:35.670 --> 04:20:35.680 align:start position:0%
period that's where the focus really is
 
04:20:37.548 --> 04:20:37.558 align:start position:0%
a provisional sort of that's correct
 
04:20:40.390 --> 04:20:40.400 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah if if there's more than one um
 
04:20:42.270 --> 04:20:42.280 align:start position:0%
qualified person in the organization
 
04:20:44.310 --> 04:20:44.320 align:start position:0%
then there's still somebody that has the
 
04:20:46.948 --> 04:20:46.958 align:start position:0%
right to operate the organization but if
 
04:20:49.230 --> 04:20:49.240 align:start position:0%
the if it's a solo organization and that
 
04:20:52.150 --> 04:20:52.160 align:start position:0%
one person becomes disqualified by death
 
04:20:55.590 --> 04:20:55.600 align:start position:0%
disability or or lure they then there's
 
04:20:57.948 --> 04:20:57.958 align:start position:0%
nobody left to be able to sort of wind
 
04:21:00.708 --> 04:21:00.718 align:start position:0%
down sell or at least from a corporate
 
04:21:02.510 --> 04:21:02.520 align:start position:0%
standpoint and operate the organization
 
04:21:04.548 --> 04:21:04.558 align:start position:0%
until you know it can be dissolved and
 
04:21:06.390 --> 04:21:06.400 align:start position:0%
that the period of one year was chosen
 
04:21:09.548 --> 04:21:09.558 align:start position:0%
just as a reasonable time frame but um
 
04:21:12.190 --> 04:21:12.200 align:start position:0%
you know it in many instances it would
 
04:21:13.868 --> 04:21:13.878 align:start position:0%
happen much quicker than that but but
 
04:21:17.070 --> 04:21:17.080 align:start position:0%
otherwise there's no there's no legal um
 
04:21:19.548 --> 04:21:19.558 align:start position:0%
and there's no legal person able to to
 
04:21:21.270 --> 04:21:21.280 align:start position:0%
operate the
 
04:21:24.708 --> 04:21:24.718 align:start position:0%
organization follow up follow up
 
04:21:27.310 --> 04:21:27.320 align:start position:0%
um yeah you would think a year's time
 
04:21:29.430 --> 04:21:29.440 align:start position:0%
would be enough but boy I've seen
 
04:21:32.030 --> 04:21:32.040 align:start position:0%
businesses take um couple of years
 
04:21:34.708 --> 04:21:34.718 align:start position:0%
several years you know railroads
 
04:21:36.708 --> 04:21:36.718 align:start position:0%
sometimes take 10 or 15 years to
 
04:21:39.590 --> 04:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
dissolve all the assets I mean this a
 
04:21:42.430 --> 04:21:42.440 align:start position:0%
much smaller condensed sort of a right
 
04:21:47.070 --> 04:21:47.080 align:start position:0%
entity um but hold over a provision um
 
04:21:49.948 --> 04:21:49.958 align:start position:0%
in case it for some unforeseen reason it
 
04:21:51.788 --> 04:21:51.798 align:start position:0%
took longer than a year what happens if
 
04:21:54.350 --> 04:21:54.360 align:start position:0%
the year expires and it's not
 
04:21:56.708 --> 04:21:56.718 align:start position:0%
accomplished yeah that's a good question
 
04:22:00.270 --> 04:22:00.280 align:start position:0%
you know I uh we we had the assistance
 
04:22:03.070 --> 04:22:03.080 align:start position:0%
of of uh Mr gown's attorney in in
 
04:22:04.750 --> 04:22:04.760 align:start position:0%
putting this together I think the goal
 
04:22:07.230 --> 04:22:07.240 align:start position:0%
was to make it very clear that this
 
04:22:10.670 --> 04:22:10.680 align:start position:0%
can't somehow become an ongoing entity
 
04:22:12.510 --> 04:22:12.520 align:start position:0%
um and I think that's the reason but
 
04:22:14.830 --> 04:22:14.840 align:start position:0%
again I I do not know exactly what what
 
04:22:16.670 --> 04:22:16.680 align:start position:0%
the reason for a year was but I think
 
04:22:19.190 --> 04:22:19.200 align:start position:0%
his thought was that you know in a small
 
04:22:21.910 --> 04:22:21.920 align:start position:0%
solo practice you could wind it down and
 
04:22:23.948 --> 04:22:23.958 align:start position:0%
and and it should be very clear that
 
04:22:25.910 --> 04:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
this is not a loophole that's going to
 
04:22:28.190 --> 04:22:28.200 align:start position:0%
allow a corporate entity to go forward
 
04:22:30.030 --> 04:22:30.040 align:start position:0%
that that shouldn't be allowed to under
 
04:22:31.910 --> 04:22:31.920 align:start position:0%
that that statute
 
04:22:34.670 --> 04:22:34.680 align:start position:0%
thanks that makes it clear okay other
 
04:22:37.590 --> 04:22:37.600 align:start position:0%
questions so you know uh represent CH I
 
04:22:40.990 --> 04:22:41.000 align:start position:0%
do have one question I I I think I'm
 
04:22:45.868 --> 04:22:45.878 align:start position:0%
maybe a little confused I um I
 
04:22:49.190 --> 04:22:49.200 align:start position:0%
understand from the um from the first
 
04:22:53.230 --> 04:22:53.240 align:start position:0%
sentence of uh section 304 D12 as you've
 
04:22:57.190 --> 04:22:57.200 align:start position:0%
proposed to amend it that it says that
 
04:23:00.190 --> 04:23:00.200 align:start position:0%
the the the assistant manager in the
 
04:23:02.470 --> 04:23:02.480 align:start position:0%
case of a Li mited liability company
 
04:23:04.470 --> 04:23:04.480 align:start position:0%
shall be a qualified person so for
 
04:23:07.070 --> 04:23:07.080 align:start position:0%
example in the in the veterinary let's
 
04:23:09.548 --> 04:23:09.558 align:start position:0%
say that it's a Veterinary prati
 
04:23:11.990 --> 04:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
solo Veterinary practice in other words
 
04:23:14.150 --> 04:23:14.160 align:start position:0%
with with a limited liability company
 
04:23:18.310 --> 04:23:18.320 align:start position:0%
and the and the sole uh member of that
 
04:23:19.990 --> 04:23:20.000 align:start position:0%
limited liability company is the
 
04:23:22.750 --> 04:23:22.760 align:start position:0%
veterinarian that's running the practice
 
04:23:24.830 --> 04:23:24.840 align:start position:0%
as I understand
 
04:23:27.910 --> 04:23:27.920 align:start position:0%
this that veterinarian could have an
 
04:23:27.920 --> 04:23:29.548 align:start position:0%
this that veterinarian could have an
assistant

04:23:29.548 --> 04:23:29.558 align:start position:0%
assistant
 
04:23:34.110 --> 04:23:34.120 align:start position:0%
manager uh who is also a veterinarian a
 
04:23:37.590 --> 04:23:37.600 align:start position:0%
licensed veterinarian um and therefore
 
04:23:40.590 --> 04:23:40.600 align:start position:0%
would qualify as a qualified
 
04:23:43.230 --> 04:23:43.240 align:start position:0%
person right I think it's the reverse of
 
04:23:45.030 --> 04:23:45.040 align:start position:0%
that like you have to be a qualified
 
04:23:47.708 --> 04:23:47.718 align:start position:0%
person to hold the role holding the role
 
04:23:49.868 --> 04:23:49.878 align:start position:0%
doesn't make you a qualif oh no no no I
 
04:23:51.150 --> 04:23:51.160 align:start position:0%
understand that but but in other words
 
04:23:54.350 --> 04:23:54.360 align:start position:0%
in my example so Veterinary the you know
 
04:23:57.910 --> 04:23:57.920 align:start position:0%
the the tur Veterinary practice has Eric
 
04:24:01.350 --> 04:24:01.360 align:start position:0%
turr veterinarian as the owner
 
04:24:04.990 --> 04:24:05.000 align:start position:0%
uh and the sole member yes and has me
 
04:24:07.390 --> 04:24:07.400 align:start position:0%
let's let's say I has Bob Linn as not an
 
04:24:10.868 --> 04:24:10.878 align:start position:0%
owner but a veterinarian uh and and
 
04:24:14.110 --> 04:24:14.120 align:start position:0%
under this you could make me the ve an
 
04:24:15.708 --> 04:24:15.718 align:start position:0%
assistant manager in case something
 
04:24:18.230 --> 04:24:18.240 align:start position:0%
happened to you yeah I believe what I
 
04:24:20.830 --> 04:24:20.840 align:start position:0%
was trying to answer um to
 
04:24:22.868 --> 04:24:22.878 align:start position:0%
representative mano's question was kind
 
04:24:24.708 --> 04:24:24.718 align:start position:0%
of along those lines it does not
 
04:24:26.948 --> 04:24:26.958 align:start position:0%
preclude that person from being a
 
04:24:30.868 --> 04:24:30.878 align:start position:0%
qualified member but it it doesn't in it
 
04:24:32.990 --> 04:24:33.000 align:start position:0%
it it allows that one role to be held by
 
04:24:35.030 --> 04:24:35.040 align:start position:0%
someone who's not and so it's not a role
 
04:24:36.590 --> 04:24:36.600 align:start position:0%
that comes into play only when the
 
04:24:38.510 --> 04:24:38.520 align:start position:0%
person's disqualified this would be
 
04:24:40.310 --> 04:24:40.320 align:start position:0%
somebody who's part of their practice on
 
04:24:43.190 --> 04:24:43.200 align:start position:0%
an ongoing basis and able to take over
 
04:24:45.708 --> 04:24:45.718 align:start position:0%
if something were to happen right I you
 
04:24:47.510 --> 04:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
know what I I guess but the thing that
 
04:24:50.830 --> 04:24:50.840 align:start position:0%
confuses me is where it says that that
 
04:24:53.510 --> 04:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
person the ass shall be a qualified
 
04:24:55.470 --> 04:24:55.480 align:start position:0%
person with respect to the professional
 
04:24:57.948 --> 04:24:57.958 align:start position:0%
limited liability company and I I
 
04:25:00.868 --> 04:25:00.878 align:start position:0%
thought that what that meant was in the
 
04:25:04.470 --> 04:25:04.480 align:start position:0%
Veterinary example that I can become the
 
04:25:06.510 --> 04:25:06.520 align:start position:0%
assistant manager of your Veterinary
 
04:25:10.430 --> 04:25:10.440 align:start position:0%
practice as long as I'm a qualified
 
04:25:12.230 --> 04:25:12.240 align:start position:0%
veterinarian I don't in other words I
 
04:25:13.548 --> 04:25:13.558 align:start position:0%
don't have to be an owner of your
 
04:25:15.030 --> 04:25:15.040 align:start position:0%
company but in order to become the
 
04:25:16.470 --> 04:25:16.480 align:start position:0%
assistant manager I have to be a
 
04:25:16.480 --> 04:25:18.628 align:start position:0%
assistant manager I have to be a
qualified

04:25:18.628 --> 04:25:18.638 align:start position:0%
qualified
 
04:25:21.070 --> 04:25:21.080 align:start position:0%
veterinarian yeah again I as I'm looking
 
04:25:22.990 --> 04:25:23.000 align:start position:0%
at this I maybe I can see where the
 
04:25:24.990 --> 04:25:25.000 align:start position:0%
confusion because it does say you know
 
04:25:28.030 --> 04:25:28.040 align:start position:0%
the assistant manager um exists in the
 
04:25:31.390 --> 04:25:31.400 align:start position:0%
case of a single member uh professional
 
04:25:35.750 --> 04:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
L limited liability Corporation um I
 
04:25:39.430 --> 04:25:39.440 align:start position:0%
again I I I my understanding my belief
 
04:25:42.990 --> 04:25:43.000 align:start position:0%
is that you know the the the idea was
 
04:25:45.628 --> 04:25:45.638 align:start position:0%
that it would not preclude that um
 
04:25:47.350 --> 04:25:47.360 align:start position:0%
profession but maybe the way that first
 
04:25:50.310 --> 04:25:50.320 align:start position:0%
sentence is worded sort of means that
 
04:25:53.310 --> 04:25:53.320 align:start position:0%
that person sort of can only exist
 
04:25:54.750 --> 04:25:54.760 align:start position:0%
that's the way I that's the way I read
 
04:25:57.390 --> 04:25:57.400 align:start position:0%
it and that's why I was saying if if if
 
04:25:59.670 --> 04:25:59.680 align:start position:0%
if you do read it that way and I think
 
04:26:02.070 --> 04:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
that to me that is is the way it reads
 
04:26:05.350 --> 04:26:05.360 align:start position:0%
you know shall be shall be qualified
 
04:26:07.150 --> 04:26:07.160 align:start position:0%
persons with respect to the limited
 
04:26:09.350 --> 04:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
liability company that seems to me to
 
04:26:11.670 --> 04:26:11.680 align:start position:0%
say you you if you want to be the
 
04:26:14.110 --> 04:26:14.120 align:start position:0%
assistant manager in a Veterinary
 
04:26:15.470 --> 04:26:15.480 align:start position:0%
practice you have to be a licensed
 
04:26:18.990 --> 04:26:19.000 align:start position:0%
veterinarian and if that's true then the
 
04:26:19.000 --> 04:26:20.070 align:start position:0%
veterinarian and if that's true then the
second

04:26:20.070 --> 04:26:20.080 align:start position:0%
second
 
04:26:22.868 --> 04:26:22.878 align:start position:0%
sentence doesn't seem to change that so
 
04:26:26.390 --> 04:26:26.400 align:start position:0%
if your intent was to allow
 
04:26:29.070 --> 04:26:29.080 align:start position:0%
somebody in this circumstance for some
 
04:26:31.430 --> 04:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
limited period of time who is not a
 
04:26:33.948 --> 04:26:33.958 align:start position:0%
veterinarian to qu to serve as the
 
04:26:36.150 --> 04:26:36.160 align:start position:0%
assistant manager I think we need to
 
04:26:38.150 --> 04:26:38.160 align:start position:0%
tweak this language a bit yeah I'm I'm
 
04:26:40.750 --> 04:26:40.760 align:start position:0%
wondering and again we can I can do this
 
04:26:42.788 --> 04:26:42.798 align:start position:0%
after the fact but you know in that
 
04:26:44.430 --> 04:26:44.440 align:start position:0%
first instance where it introduces the
 
04:26:46.990 --> 04:26:47.000 align:start position:0%
role of assistant manager maybe the the
 
04:26:48.230 --> 04:26:48.240 align:start position:0%
second part of that sentence where it
 
04:26:50.390 --> 04:26:50.400 align:start position:0%
says assistant manager in the case of a
 
04:26:53.910 --> 04:26:53.920 align:start position:0%
single member uh pllc right um maybe
 
04:26:55.670 --> 04:26:55.680 align:start position:0%
that part's not needed maybe it just
 
04:26:57.708 --> 04:26:57.718 align:start position:0%
introduces the role of assistant manager
 
04:26:59.628 --> 04:26:59.638 align:start position:0%
and then later qualifies that that role
 
04:27:02.070 --> 04:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
can be held I I I I think I'm seeing
 
04:27:03.830 --> 04:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
what you're seeing which is that by
 
04:27:06.150 --> 04:27:06.160 align:start position:0%
saying it can only exist in a single
 
04:27:08.670 --> 04:27:08.680 align:start position:0%
partner organization you can't possibly
 
04:27:12.030 --> 04:27:12.040 align:start position:0%
have a a a another qualified member in
 
04:27:13.150 --> 04:27:13.160 align:start position:0%
that role because it wouldn't be a
 
04:27:15.750 --> 04:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
single right partner organization so
 
04:27:17.270 --> 04:27:17.280 align:start position:0%
yeah I I I take that and I think that
 
04:27:20.390 --> 04:27:20.400 align:start position:0%
could be fixed okay represent Wallace
 
04:27:22.390 --> 04:27:22.400 align:start position:0%
yes thank you that's what I was going to
 
04:27:24.070 --> 04:27:24.080 align:start position:0%
just kind of put out there people
 
04:27:26.708 --> 04:27:26.718 align:start position:0%
understand a single member LLC is just
 
04:27:29.670 --> 04:27:29.680 align:start position:0%
that the only manager is that member and
 
04:27:31.990 --> 04:27:32.000 align:start position:0%
I think we may be confusing
 
04:27:35.390 --> 04:27:35.400 align:start position:0%
managing the veterinary office doesn't
 
04:27:39.390 --> 04:27:39.400 align:start position:0%
make you a manager of the LLC that's two
 
04:27:42.470 --> 04:27:42.480 align:start position:0%
distinctly different the term manager if
 
04:27:44.350 --> 04:27:44.360 align:start position:0%
you will sorry yeah yeah the term
 
04:27:46.190 --> 04:27:46.200 align:start position:0%
manager I think is a bit confusing in
 
04:27:47.948 --> 04:27:47.958 align:start position:0%
the the way the law is written because
 
04:27:49.830 --> 04:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
it it doesn't mean manager in the way I
 
04:27:51.230 --> 04:27:51.240 align:start position:0%
think most people are thinking of a
 
04:27:54.708 --> 04:27:54.718 align:start position:0%
manager correct all right great I mean
 
04:27:57.030 --> 04:27:57.040 align:start position:0%
that's analogous to a president of a s
 
04:27:59.430 --> 04:27:59.440 align:start position:0%
orc Corporation the manager of an LLC or
 
04:27:59.440 --> 04:28:01.548 align:start position:0%
orc Corporation the manager of an LLC or
pllc

04:28:01.548 --> 04:28:01.558 align:start position:0%
pllc
 
04:28:04.310 --> 04:28:04.320 align:start position:0%
yeah yes representative stapled yeah if
 
04:28:07.190 --> 04:28:07.200 align:start position:0%
you're going to add anything to it a
 
04:28:10.628 --> 04:28:10.638 align:start position:0%
business manager might be a better term
 
04:28:13.350 --> 04:28:13.360 align:start position:0%
for that particular unqualified person I
 
04:28:15.470 --> 04:28:15.480 align:start position:0%
me we've had a discussion here that
 
04:28:17.190 --> 04:28:17.200 align:start position:0%
probably could consume another page
 
04:28:20.590 --> 04:28:20.600 align:start position:0%
worth of uh words to clarify and
 
04:28:24.510 --> 04:28:24.520 align:start position:0%
differentiate but uh that that little
 
04:28:28.110 --> 04:28:28.120 align:start position:0%
input would that make sense uh General a
 
04:28:31.230 --> 04:28:31.240 align:start position:0%
business manager um or something similar
 
04:28:33.948 --> 04:28:33.958 align:start position:0%
to that clarify yeah I'm not sure where
 
04:28:36.390 --> 04:28:36.400 align:start position:0%
the the the term assistant manager came
 
04:28:37.990 --> 04:28:38.000 align:start position:0%
from whether whether it has any meaning
 
04:28:40.070 --> 04:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
Beyond just being an assistant manager I
 
04:28:43.430 --> 04:28:43.440 align:start position:0%
can I can we I'd be glad to talk to the
 
04:28:46.670 --> 04:28:46.680 align:start position:0%
person who helped um you know create
 
04:28:48.750 --> 04:28:48.760 align:start position:0%
this language to see if business manager
 
04:28:50.910 --> 04:28:50.920 align:start position:0%
would be an an
 
04:28:50.920 --> 04:28:52.910 align:start position:0%
would be an an
effective

04:28:52.910 --> 04:28:52.920 align:start position:0%
effective
 
04:28:56.350 --> 04:28:56.360 align:start position:0%
solution right representative gon thank
 
04:28:59.030 --> 04:28:59.040 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair Bill left out because I
 
04:29:03.270 --> 04:29:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:05.708 --> 04:29:05.718 align:start position:0%
darn well you may have the answer that
 
04:29:10.310 --> 04:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
we that that has eluded us I read this
 
04:29:12.830 --> 04:29:12.840 align:start position:0%
making use of the little punctuation
 
04:29:14.670 --> 04:29:14.680 align:start position:0%
mark called a
 
04:29:18.350 --> 04:29:18.360 align:start position:0%
comma and as I read this I see that each
 
04:29:20.150 --> 04:29:20.160 align:start position:0%
manager of a
 
04:29:22.510 --> 04:29:22.520 align:start position:0%
pllc they skip everything else after
 
04:29:23.830 --> 04:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
that until you get that there shall be a
 
04:29:25.430 --> 04:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
qualified person with respect to the
 
04:29:27.830 --> 04:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
professional liability company right
 
04:29:29.310 --> 04:29:29.320 align:start position:0%
then if there are any
 
04:29:31.910 --> 04:29:31.920 align:start position:0%
officers they shall be qualified persons
 
04:29:33.708 --> 04:29:33.718 align:start position:0%
with respect to the professional uh
 
04:29:35.750 --> 04:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
limited liability company
 
04:29:39.190 --> 04:29:39.200 align:start position:0%
MH other than so here's where we have
 
04:29:42.070 --> 04:29:42.080 align:start position:0%
exceptions to the law the secretary the
 
04:29:43.990 --> 04:29:44.000 align:start position:0%
assistant secretary the treasurer or an
 
04:29:47.350 --> 04:29:47.360 align:start position:0%
assistant Treasurer does not have to be
 
04:29:50.910 --> 04:29:50.920 align:start position:0%
a a qualified person so it's other than
 
04:29:53.708 --> 04:29:53.718 align:start position:0%
now you're slipping in or the assistant
 
04:29:56.070 --> 04:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
manager in the case of a single
 
04:29:59.670 --> 04:29:59.680 align:start position:0%
PC they're also exempt from being a
 
04:29:59.680 --> 04:30:03.270 align:start position:0%
PC they're also exempt from being a
qualified

04:30:03.270 --> 04:30:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:06.110 --> 04:30:06.120 align:start position:0%
person then you go on to say that that
 
04:30:08.470 --> 04:30:08.480 align:start position:0%
assistant manager can fulfill the role
 
04:30:09.270 --> 04:30:09.280 align:start position:0%
of the
 
04:30:13.670 --> 04:30:13.680 align:start position:0%
manager after for up to
 
04:30:16.750 --> 04:30:16.760 align:start position:0%
one you got it you you're absolutely
 
04:30:18.310 --> 04:30:18.320 align:start position:0%
right thank you you're absolutely right
 
04:30:20.030 --> 04:30:20.040 align:start position:0%
I got my associates degree from verm

04:30:28.910 --> 04:30:28.920 align:start position:0%
love okay
 
04:30:33.030 --> 04:30:33.040 align:start position:0%
um m Mr chair I think that the interest
 
04:30:37.750 --> 04:30:37.760 align:start position:0%
in this is fascinating but the clock is
 
04:30:41.670 --> 04:30:41.680 align:start position:0%
ticking and we can edit this I
 
04:30:45.990 --> 04:30:46.000 align:start position:0%
truthfully would very much like to hear
 
04:30:49.430 --> 04:30:49.440 align:start position:0%
from the I believe probably the next
 
04:30:49.440 --> 04:30:50.750 align:start position:0%
from the I believe probably the next
witness

04:30:50.750 --> 04:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
witness
 
04:30:55.030 --> 04:30:55.040 align:start position:0%
who is who brought the problem to the
 
04:30:58.548 --> 04:30:58.558 align:start position:0%
attention of our colleague to perhaps
 
04:31:01.510 --> 04:31:01.520 align:start position:0%
help give us a frame work so that we can
 
04:31:03.310 --> 04:31:03.320 align:start position:0%
understand what the difficulty is I
 
04:31:06.190 --> 04:31:06.200 align:start position:0%
guess I'm an experiential learner and
 
04:31:08.590 --> 04:31:08.600 align:start position:0%
that's why I might need that and we
 
04:31:12.310 --> 04:31:12.320 align:start position:0%
could deal with the actual
 
04:31:14.708 --> 04:31:14.718 align:start position:0%
language after the
 
04:31:16.868 --> 04:31:16.878 align:start position:0%
hearing sounds good does that make sense
 
04:31:18.910 --> 04:31:18.920 align:start position:0%
it does make sense and I I I will commit
 
04:31:21.510 --> 04:31:21.520 align:start position:0%
to you know revisiting the question of
 
04:31:23.030 --> 04:31:23.040 align:start position:0%
that the all the various things that
 
04:31:24.670 --> 04:31:24.680 align:start position:0%
were brought up with that that language
 
04:31:29.150 --> 04:31:29.160 align:start position:0%
and make sure that it a um conforms
 
04:31:29.160 --> 04:31:30.788 align:start position:0%
and make sure that it a um conforms
to

04:31:30.788 --> 04:31:30.798 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:31:32.628 --> 04:31:32.638 align:start position:0%
not creating a conflict within this
 
04:31:34.590 --> 04:31:34.600 align:start position:0%
paragraph and then and then also to
 
04:31:37.310 --> 04:31:37.320 align:start position:0%
assure that that the underlying need
 
04:31:38.990 --> 04:31:39.000 align:start position:0%
which I guess the last question may have
 
04:31:41.910 --> 04:31:41.920 align:start position:0%
been the question of does is is is this
 
04:31:43.868 --> 04:31:43.878 align:start position:0%
create the need I I still think the need
 
04:31:45.628 --> 04:31:45.638 align:start position:0%
exists but I will I will work to make
 
04:31:47.310 --> 04:31:47.320 align:start position:0%
sure that it
 
04:31:49.510 --> 04:31:49.520 align:start position:0%
does sound no that sounds good that
 
04:31:51.070 --> 04:31:51.080 align:start position:0%
sounds good all right other questions
 
04:31:52.310 --> 04:31:52.320 align:start position:0%
for this
 
04:31:54.590 --> 04:31:54.600 align:start position:0%
witness thank you thank you for your
 
04:31:58.070 --> 04:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
attention all right uh Roger gone is
 
04:32:20.788 --> 04:32:20.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:22.110 --> 04:32:22.120 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman members of the committee
 
04:32:23.510 --> 04:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to testify
 
04:32:26.510 --> 04:32:26.520 align:start position:0%
today my name is Roger gown my wife Dr
 
04:32:28.670 --> 04:32:28.680 align:start position:0%
jod Kaufman is a veterinarian who owned
 
04:32:31.948 --> 04:32:31.958 align:start position:0%
a practice in exitor for 20 28 years HB
 
04:32:34.030 --> 04:32:34.040 align:start position:0%
1082 addresses a problem with succession
 
04:32:35.788 --> 04:32:35.798 align:start position:0%
planning for small professional
 
04:32:37.628 --> 04:32:37.638 align:start position:0%
practices like my wife's in New
 
04:32:39.948 --> 04:32:39.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in a single member limited
 
04:32:41.830 --> 04:32:41.840 align:start position:0%
liability company or professional
 
04:32:43.948 --> 04:32:43.958 align:start position:0%
limited liability company that has an
 
04:32:47.190 --> 04:32:47.200 align:start position:0%
owner manager but no assistant manager
 
04:32:49.310 --> 04:32:49.320 align:start position:0%
when the manager dies the executive of
 
04:32:51.070 --> 04:32:51.080 align:start position:0%
the estate must petition the probate
 
04:32:53.430 --> 04:32:53.440 align:start position:0%
court for an order appointing a person
 
04:32:55.990 --> 04:32:56.000 align:start position:0%
to administer the practice winding it up
 
04:32:58.830 --> 04:32:58.840 align:start position:0%
and dissolving it or selling it it can
 
04:33:00.390 --> 04:33:00.400 align:start position:0%
take several months to get such order
 
04:33:03.270 --> 04:33:03.280 align:start position:0%
from the Probate Court during that time
 
04:33:05.150 --> 04:33:05.160 align:start position:0%
with no one to manage the business it's
 
04:33:08.350 --> 04:33:08.360 align:start position:0%
likely to lose much of its value however
 
04:33:10.910 --> 04:33:10.920 align:start position:0%
if the LLC or PLC has an assistant
 
04:33:13.390 --> 04:33:13.400 align:start position:0%
manager that person can immediately step
 
04:33:16.708 --> 04:33:16.718 align:start position:0%
in and manage the practice in present
 
04:33:19.270 --> 04:33:19.280 align:start position:0%
law in order to designate someone as the
 
04:33:22.548 --> 04:33:22.558 align:start position:0%
assistant manager of PC that person must
 
04:33:25.590 --> 04:33:25.600 align:start position:0%
be licensed in the profession of the PC
 
04:33:27.830 --> 04:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
in our case although I managed the
 
04:33:29.590 --> 04:33:29.600 align:start position:0%
finances of my wife's business for many
 
04:33:29.600 --> 04:33:30.510 align:start position:0%
finances of my wife's business for many
years

04:33:30.510 --> 04:33:30.520 align:start position:0%
years
 
04:33:32.510 --> 04:33:32.520 align:start position:0%
I was not eligible to be named assistant
 
04:33:34.590 --> 04:33:34.600 align:start position:0%
manager because I'm not a
 
04:33:36.708 --> 04:33:36.718 align:start position:0%
veterinarian in the event of her death I
 
04:33:38.430 --> 04:33:38.440 align:start position:0%
would have no authority over her
 
04:33:40.750 --> 04:33:40.760 align:start position:0%
business even as the executive of her
 
04:33:43.030 --> 04:33:43.040 align:start position:0%
estate I could not pay employees or
 
04:33:45.830 --> 04:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
vendors hire a relief veterinarian to
 
04:33:47.868 --> 04:33:47.878 align:start position:0%
keep the business going convert the
 
04:33:50.390 --> 04:33:50.400 align:start position:0%
business to an LLC or work to wind it up
 
04:33:51.590 --> 04:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
and sell
 
04:33:54.470 --> 04:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
it under present law the licensed
 
04:33:57.190 --> 04:33:57.200 align:start position:0%
professional PC owner must identify
 
04:33:59.310 --> 04:33:59.320 align:start position:0%
another licensed professional that they
 
04:34:01.868 --> 04:34:01.878 align:start position:0%
have the utmost trust in one who is
 
04:34:03.510 --> 04:34:03.520 align:start position:0%
willing to take on such a large
 
04:34:05.750 --> 04:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
responsibility simply as a
 
04:34:08.150 --> 04:34:08.160 align:start position:0%
favor this is not an easy task for the
 
04:34:10.430 --> 04:34:10.440 align:start position:0%
owner of a small single member practice
 
04:34:14.510 --> 04:34:14.520 align:start position:0%
and it isn't always possible HB 1082
 
04:34:16.270 --> 04:34:16.280 align:start position:0%
would make it easier for owner managers
 
04:34:18.788 --> 04:34:18.798 align:start position:0%
to designate an assistant manager as
 
04:34:20.030 --> 04:34:20.040 align:start position:0%
that person would not need to be
 
04:34:22.548 --> 04:34:22.558 align:start position:0%
licensed within the profession this
 
04:34:23.590 --> 04:34:23.600 align:start position:0%
person could be the licensed
 
04:34:25.948 --> 04:34:25.958 align:start position:0%
professional spouse or other trusted
 
04:34:28.270 --> 04:34:28.280 align:start position:0%
family member of course the
 
04:34:30.430 --> 04:34:30.440 align:start position:0%
nonprofessional assistant manager would
 
04:34:32.590 --> 04:34:32.600 align:start position:0%
have a limited time in which to act
 
04:34:34.190 --> 04:34:34.200 align:start position:0%
would not be permitted to work in the
 
04:34:36.670 --> 04:34:36.680 align:start position:0%
practices a professional capacity and
 
04:34:38.110 --> 04:34:38.120 align:start position:0%
would have to act in accordance with the
 
04:34:42.110 --> 04:34:42.120 align:start position:0%
plc's operating agreement HB 1082 would
 
04:34:43.350 --> 04:34:43.360 align:start position:0%
help ensure that the interests and
 
04:34:45.310 --> 04:34:45.320 align:start position:0%
desires of the owner of a small
 
04:34:47.110 --> 04:34:47.120 align:start position:0%
professional practice would be kept
 
04:34:48.628 --> 04:34:48.638 align:start position:0%
Paramount in the resolution of the
 
04:34:50.190 --> 04:34:50.200 align:start position:0%
business thank you for your
 
04:34:51.430 --> 04:34:51.440 align:start position:0%
consideration I look forward to
 
04:34:54.070 --> 04:34:54.080 align:start position:0%
answering your questions questions for
 
04:34:56.750 --> 04:34:56.760 align:start position:0%
this witness yes representative
 
04:34:59.350 --> 04:34:59.360 align:start position:0%
Divine um couldn't that designation be
 
04:35:02.910 --> 04:35:02.920 align:start position:0%
listed in in an operating agreement
 
04:35:04.788 --> 04:35:04.798 align:start position:0%
within the business yes and would have
 
04:35:07.110 --> 04:35:07.120 align:start position:0%
to be but the law does not permit it
 
04:35:08.350 --> 04:35:08.360 align:start position:0%
because it has it's a I'm a
 
04:35:10.708 --> 04:35:10.718 align:start position:0%
non-qualified person in our case Okay
 
04:35:12.948 --> 04:35:12.958 align:start position:0%
the law requires it to be a qualified
 
04:35:15.948 --> 04:35:15.958 align:start position:0%
person but on on based on say in an
 
04:35:18.590 --> 04:35:18.600 align:start position:0%
operating agreement usually there's some
 
04:35:23.070 --> 04:35:23.080 align:start position:0%
sort of um Provisions for um you know if
 
04:35:25.548 --> 04:35:25.558 align:start position:0%
if there was a death or something would
 
04:35:27.470 --> 04:35:27.480 align:start position:0%
happen where if there were Partnerships
 
04:35:30.350 --> 04:35:30.360 align:start position:0%
or anything like that but in in a uh
 
04:35:33.430 --> 04:35:33.440 align:start position:0%
limited single person single person yes
 
04:35:35.470 --> 04:35:35.480 align:start position:0%
that would not you're stating that that
 
04:35:37.190 --> 04:35:37.200 align:start position:0%
would not qualify right you still have
 
04:35:39.750 --> 04:35:39.760 align:start position:0%
to find someone to be that other person
 
04:35:41.628 --> 04:35:41.638 align:start position:0%
because you're a single member okay and
 
04:35:42.948 --> 04:35:42.958 align:start position:0%
so the operating agreement in our case
 
04:35:44.708 --> 04:35:44.718 align:start position:0%
the operating agreement lists as
 
04:35:47.070 --> 04:35:47.080 align:start position:0%
assistant manager um a very close friend
 
04:35:50.030 --> 04:35:50.040 align:start position:0%
of ours who is a veterinarian who would
 
04:35:51.350 --> 04:35:51.360 align:start position:0%
be willing to step in although that
 
04:35:55.230 --> 04:35:55.240 align:start position:0%
would be a huge challenge right thank
 
04:35:58.670 --> 04:35:58.680 align:start position:0%
you other questions for this witness
 
04:36:00.390 --> 04:36:00.400 align:start position:0%

04:36:20.548 --> 04:36:20.558 align:start position:0%
a few minutes to go before we can do the
 
04:36:20.558 --> 04:36:22.390 align:start position:0%
a few minutes to go before we can do the
next

04:36:22.390 --> 04:36:22.400 align:start position:0%

04:36:28.670 --> 04:36:28.680 align:start position:0%

04:46:12.350 --> 04:46:12.360 align:start position:0%
your committee two years ago with a very
 
04:46:15.510 --> 04:46:15.520 align:start position:0%
similar bill it was House Bill 236 at
 
04:46:19.150 --> 04:46:19.160 align:start position:0%
the time and this bill established a
 
04:46:22.430 --> 04:46:22.440 align:start position:0%
past statute of limitations that was six
 
04:46:25.910 --> 04:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
years so not three years it had broad
 
04:46:29.708 --> 04:46:29.718 align:start position:0%
bipartisan support um I have a speech
 
04:46:32.350 --> 04:46:32.360 align:start position:0%
here that has a lot of the background on
 
04:46:34.708 --> 04:46:34.718 align:start position:0%
past but I'm not sure where people are
 
04:46:37.628 --> 04:46:37.638 align:start position:0%
at with their knowledge of the situation
 
04:46:39.788 --> 04:46:39.798 align:start position:0%
so I don't want to take up too much of
 
04:46:41.830 --> 04:46:41.840 align:start position:0%
your time but at the same time I also
 
04:46:44.110 --> 04:46:44.120 align:start position:0%
want to be able to tell you why you're
 
04:46:46.190 --> 04:46:46.200 align:start position:0%
voting on this if there's a story behind
 
04:46:49.230 --> 04:46:49.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:53.788 --> 04:46:53.798 align:start position:0%
know so I leave it up to you to just let
 
04:46:57.708 --> 04:46:57.718 align:start position:0%
me know if I'm going on too long um so
 
04:47:00.868 --> 04:47:00.878 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm back here to today um because we
 
04:47:04.070 --> 04:47:04.080 align:start position:0%
created an statute of limitation on
 
04:47:06.868 --> 04:47:06.878 align:start position:0%
civil actions relative to damage caused
 
04:47:11.910 --> 04:47:11.920 align:start position:0%
by past chemicals um and what we're
 
04:47:14.350 --> 04:47:14.360 align:start position:0%
thinking now is that with forever
 
04:47:17.310 --> 04:47:17.320 align:start position:0%
chemicals it takes a really long time to
 
04:47:19.590 --> 04:47:19.600 align:start position:0%
find out what the health impacts are and
 
04:47:22.150 --> 04:47:22.160 align:start position:0%
the impacts to a community a community's
 
04:47:25.590 --> 04:47:25.600 align:start position:0%
water supply and so this
 
04:47:29.350 --> 04:47:29.360 align:start position:0%
bill that we're speaking about today
 
04:47:33.110 --> 04:47:33.120 align:start position:0%
would change that six-year statute of
 
04:47:35.548 --> 04:47:35.558 align:start position:0%
limitations to
 
04:47:38.628 --> 04:47:38.638 align:start position:0%
a um what it says here I'm not sure if
 
04:47:40.510 --> 04:47:40.520 align:start position:0%
this writing is what we would want it to
 
04:47:44.190 --> 04:47:44.200 align:start position:0%
say but any time after a plaintiff or
 
04:47:47.750 --> 04:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
the state discovers such harm injury or
 
04:47:51.310 --> 04:47:51.320 align:start position:0%
damages and the causal relationship of
 
04:47:54.910 --> 04:47:54.920 align:start position:0%
an act or Omission to such harm injury
 
04:47:54.920 --> 04:47:55.868 align:start position:0%
an act or Omission to such harm injury
or

04:47:55.868 --> 04:47:55.878 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:47:58.070 --> 04:47:58.080 align:start position:0%
damage I can tell you a little bit about
 
04:48:00.590 --> 04:48:00.600 align:start position:0%
why we would want to change this um just
 
04:48:03.788 --> 04:48:03.798 align:start position:0%
for the fact that you are hearing P
 
04:48:06.628 --> 04:48:06.638 align:start position:0%
before you um we're talking about these
 
04:48:08.750 --> 04:48:08.760 align:start position:0%
bills we're in Health and Human Services
 
04:48:12.788 --> 04:48:12.798 align:start position:0%
talking about health impacts um we're in
 
04:48:16.230 --> 04:48:16.240 align:start position:0%
um resources where my the committee I
 
04:48:19.548 --> 04:48:19.558 align:start position:0%
come from to in order to look at some of
 
04:48:23.590 --> 04:48:23.600 align:start position:0%
the mitigation that we can do but no
 
04:48:25.468 --> 04:48:25.478 align:start position:0%
matter what we're doing we're always
 
04:48:29.190 --> 04:48:29.200 align:start position:0%
working with people who need more time
 
04:48:32.990 --> 04:48:33.000 align:start position:0%
and we know that forever chemicals can
 
04:48:35.150 --> 04:48:35.160 align:start position:0%
affect you it takes years for some of
 
04:48:37.150 --> 04:48:37.160 align:start position:0%
these emerging cancers that are
 
04:48:40.030 --> 04:48:40.040 align:start position:0%
associated and other health impacts to
 
04:48:42.548 --> 04:48:42.558 align:start position:0%
come about and it also takes a lot of
 
04:48:45.910 --> 04:48:45.920 align:start position:0%
time for a state and a state agency like
 
04:48:51.190 --> 04:48:51.200 align:start position:0%
Dees to be able to bring um what we
 
04:48:53.468 --> 04:48:53.478 align:start position:0%
consider people responsible for
 
04:48:55.270 --> 04:48:55.280 align:start position:0%
pollution in the environment to the
 
04:48:57.948 --> 04:48:57.958 align:start position:0%
table and to be able to seek legal
 
04:48:57.958 --> 04:48:59.110 align:start position:0%
table and to be able to seek legal
remedy

04:48:59.110 --> 04:48:59.120 align:start position:0%
remedy
 
04:49:02.310 --> 04:49:02.320 align:start position:0%
I think right now there's a real big
 
04:49:06.390 --> 04:49:06.400 align:start position:0%
concern because one of the most um
 
04:49:09.548 --> 04:49:09.558 align:start position:0%
proliferant polluters for lack of a
 
04:49:13.230 --> 04:49:13.240 align:start position:0%
better word is leaving the state and
 
04:49:15.430 --> 04:49:15.440 align:start position:0%
they're leaving the factory behind and
 
04:49:17.788 --> 04:49:17.798 align:start position:0%
we don't know what is going to happen
 
04:49:20.190 --> 04:49:20.200 align:start position:0%
there in fact it's very difficult to
 
04:49:23.390 --> 04:49:23.400 align:start position:0%
tell what exactly has gone on
 
04:49:27.750 --> 04:49:27.760 align:start position:0%
there so um just to review again with
 
04:49:30.070 --> 04:49:30.080 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
04:49:33.310 --> 04:49:33.320 align:start position:0%
what we're seeking right now is to
 
04:49:35.948 --> 04:49:35.958 align:start position:0%
remove the statute of limitations but
 
04:49:39.868 --> 04:49:39.878 align:start position:0%
also to augment what we already have in
 
04:49:43.830 --> 04:49:43.840 align:start position:0%
law so that anytime after a plaintiff or
 
04:49:48.310 --> 04:49:48.320 align:start position:0%
the state or a um Municipal Water Supply
 
04:49:52.990 --> 04:49:53.000 align:start position:0%
um another Municipal agency can discover
 
04:49:56.548 --> 04:49:56.558 align:start position:0%
this harm injury damages and the causal
 
04:49:58.510 --> 04:49:58.520 align:start position:0%
relationship and they can seek the
 
04:50:01.110 --> 04:50:01.120 align:start position:0%
damages um that they will need in order
 
04:50:03.510 --> 04:50:03.520 align:start position:0%
to get their town get their health
 
04:50:06.750 --> 04:50:06.760 align:start position:0%
whatever whoever the litigant is um back
 
04:50:08.830 --> 04:50:08.840 align:start position:0%
on track so I'm going to conclude with
 
04:50:11.430 --> 04:50:11.440 align:start position:0%
that and if you um have questions
 
04:50:14.150 --> 04:50:14.160 align:start position:0%
about as I said the contamination the
 
04:50:15.948 --> 04:50:15.958 align:start position:0%
source of it the length of time we're
 
04:50:18.230 --> 04:50:18.240 align:start position:0%
talking about this was only two years
 
04:50:21.468 --> 04:50:21.478 align:start position:0%
ago that it went through but my
 
04:50:22.670 --> 04:50:22.680 align:start position:0%
understanding is that if you live in
 
04:50:25.670 --> 04:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
marac someone came to your door in 2016
 
04:50:27.990 --> 04:50:28.000 align:start position:0%
or 2017 and they told you that you're
 
04:50:30.110 --> 04:50:30.120 align:start position:0%
well with was full of something that
 
04:50:32.628 --> 04:50:32.638 align:start position:0%
needed to be tested and you could be
 
04:50:35.590 --> 04:50:35.600 align:start position:0%
having Health impacts from that and just
 
04:50:37.548 --> 04:50:37.558 align:start position:0%
two years later I think there's more
 
04:50:39.948 --> 04:50:39.958 align:start position:0%
information out there but there isn't
 
04:50:42.548 --> 04:50:42.558 align:start position:0%
time for people to determine what those
 
04:50:46.270 --> 04:50:46.280 align:start position:0%
impacts are financially and hold the um
 
04:50:48.230 --> 04:50:48.240 align:start position:0%
the propagate of the problems that we're
 
04:50:51.990 --> 04:50:52.000 align:start position:0%
having um accountable financially and in
 
04:50:54.868 --> 04:50:54.878 align:start position:0%
every way that we need them to be
 
04:50:57.110 --> 04:50:57.120 align:start position:0%
accountable thank you for taking my
 
04:50:59.468 --> 04:50:59.478 align:start position:0%
testimony right questions for this
 
04:51:01.070 --> 04:51:01.080 align:start position:0%
witness representative
 
04:51:03.510 --> 04:51:03.520 align:start position:0%
Manos thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
04:51:05.910 --> 04:51:05.920 align:start position:0%
taking my question so this would remove
 
04:51:08.590 --> 04:51:08.600 align:start position:0%
any statute of limitations at all is
 
04:51:08.600 --> 04:51:09.548 align:start position:0%
any statute of limitations at all is
that

04:51:09.548 --> 04:51:09.558 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:51:14.030 --> 04:51:14.040 align:start position:0%
correct yes on the uh
 
04:51:14.040 --> 04:51:15.628 align:start position:0%
correct yes on the uh
pfas

04:51:15.628 --> 04:51:15.638 align:start position:0%
pfas
 
04:51:18.990 --> 04:51:19.000 align:start position:0%
chemicals and where this statute where
 
04:51:22.548 --> 04:51:22.558 align:start position:0%
this bill would be entering into is in a
 
04:51:25.750 --> 04:51:25.760 align:start position:0%
separate area of law that's just about
 
04:51:29.750 --> 04:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
past followup thank you
 
04:51:32.590 --> 04:51:32.600 align:start position:0%
um I was thinking as as I was reading
 
04:51:34.708 --> 04:51:34.718 align:start position:0%
through this I was thinking about
 
04:51:37.390 --> 04:51:37.400 align:start position:0%
insurability and whether if the statute
 
04:51:39.628 --> 04:51:39.638 align:start position:0%
of limitations is removed
 
04:51:42.150 --> 04:51:42.160 align:start position:0%
completely whether that would make these
 
04:51:44.990 --> 04:51:45.000 align:start position:0%
kinds of claims completely
 
04:51:47.788 --> 04:51:47.798 align:start position:0%
uninsurable for manufacturers and
 
04:51:50.070 --> 04:51:50.080 align:start position:0%
whether that then creates other problems
 
04:51:50.080 --> 04:51:52.310 align:start position:0%
whether that then creates other problems
for

04:51:52.310 --> 04:51:52.320 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:51:54.548 --> 04:51:54.558 align:start position:0%
plaintiffs I think that's a really good
 
04:51:56.548 --> 04:51:56.558 align:start position:0%
question and I'm glad that I have a
 
04:51:58.430 --> 04:51:58.440 align:start position:0%
little bit of background in order to be
 
04:52:01.590 --> 04:52:01.600 align:start position:0%
able to answer it so if we remove the
 
04:52:04.750 --> 04:52:04.760 align:start position:0%
statute of limitations then insurance
 
04:52:07.708 --> 04:52:07.718 align:start position:0%
companies won't be feeling that they're
 
04:52:11.030 --> 04:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
liable they feel that this company is
 
04:52:15.430 --> 04:52:15.440 align:start position:0%
liable um so my response to that is that
 
04:52:17.270 --> 04:52:17.280 align:start position:0%
right now if you go to your doctor and
 
04:52:19.548 --> 04:52:19.558 align:start position:0%
you tell them listen I have this thing
 
04:52:21.390 --> 04:52:21.400 align:start position:0%
and it's a mile long and I have 12
 
04:52:23.788 --> 04:52:23.798 align:start position:0%
chemicals and they're like 17 times the
 
04:52:26.868 --> 04:52:26.878 align:start position:0%
amount that they consider Save which
 
04:52:29.628 --> 04:52:29.638 align:start position:0%
honestly I think zero is the only safe
 
04:52:33.110 --> 04:52:33.120 align:start position:0%
number however um you know you go to
 
04:52:34.990 --> 04:52:35.000 align:start position:0%
your doctor and the doctor doesn't even
 
04:52:37.270 --> 04:52:37.280 align:start position:0%
know what you're talking about so one of
 
04:52:39.310 --> 04:52:39.320 align:start position:0%
the things that we're trying to do
 
04:52:42.230 --> 04:52:42.240 align:start position:0%
through legislation and through ad hoc
 
04:52:44.468 --> 04:52:44.478 align:start position:0%
committees and and is just get that
 
04:52:46.708 --> 04:52:46.718 align:start position:0%
education out there because we're we
 
04:52:48.948 --> 04:52:48.958 align:start position:0%
feel like reaching the Physicians who
 
04:52:51.270 --> 04:52:51.280 align:start position:0%
are treating the illnesses that this is
 
04:52:55.190 --> 04:52:55.200 align:start position:0%
causing I mean on one hand doctors treat
 
04:52:57.750 --> 04:52:57.760 align:start position:0%
something on a symptom basis on the
 
04:52:58.708 --> 04:52:58.718 align:start position:0%
other hand
 
04:53:00.910 --> 04:53:00.920 align:start position:0%
there's a whole lot they don't know and
 
04:53:03.430 --> 04:53:03.440 align:start position:0%
they need to get into and like myself
 
04:53:05.468 --> 04:53:05.478 align:start position:0%
when a bill comes before me and I'm not
 
04:53:07.628 --> 04:53:07.638 align:start position:0%
so familiar with the area of law that
 
04:53:09.670 --> 04:53:09.680 align:start position:0%
it's in there's a lot of research that
 
04:53:11.390 --> 04:53:11.400 align:start position:0%
needs to be done before you open your
 
04:53:11.400 --> 04:53:13.350 align:start position:0%
needs to be done before you open your
mouth

04:53:13.350 --> 04:53:13.360 align:start position:0%
mouth
 
04:53:17.750 --> 04:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
so yes follow up thank you um I was
 
04:53:20.628 --> 04:53:20.638 align:start position:0%
thinking more about the question and
 
04:53:22.948 --> 04:53:22.958 align:start position:0%
it's it's a question for me as to
 
04:53:25.468 --> 04:53:25.478 align:start position:0%
whether if the statute of limitations
 
04:53:27.468 --> 04:53:27.478 align:start position:0%
were removed completely whether
 
04:53:30.990 --> 04:53:31.000 align:start position:0%
insurance companies then would because
 
04:53:32.990 --> 04:53:33.000 align:start position:0%
there's no such of limitations and the
 
04:53:35.430 --> 04:53:35.440 align:start position:0%
risk goes up greatly whether insurance
 
04:53:39.350 --> 04:53:39.360 align:start position:0%
companies would then refuse to ensure
 
04:53:47.670 --> 04:53:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:51.030 --> 04:53:51.040 align:start position:0%
claims so that's beyond the scope of
 
04:53:52.830 --> 04:53:52.840 align:start position:0%
what I would know because that sounds
 
04:53:55.190 --> 04:53:55.200 align:start position:0%
more like Commerce where you're talking
 
04:53:57.390 --> 04:53:57.400 align:start position:0%
about insurance and whether or not a
 
04:54:00.270 --> 04:54:00.280 align:start position:0%
company would be able to be insured I
 
04:54:02.830 --> 04:54:02.840 align:start position:0%
think that if you have a company coming
 
04:54:05.070 --> 04:54:05.080 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire with the way things are
 
04:54:06.628 --> 04:54:06.638 align:start position:0%
going right now and you're planning on
 
04:54:09.468 --> 04:54:09.478 align:start position:0%
sping P it's probably too late to come
 
04:54:13.868 --> 04:54:13.878 align:start position:0%
here and try to do that but I don't know
 
04:54:17.830 --> 04:54:17.840 align:start position:0%
of any liability that's been assumed let
 
04:54:20.230 --> 04:54:20.240 align:start position:0%
alone who would be doing
 
04:54:23.948 --> 04:54:23.958 align:start position:0%
it other questions so I I do have a
 
04:54:26.230 --> 04:54:26.240 align:start position:0%
couple questions first um can you tell
 
04:54:28.708 --> 04:54:28.718 align:start position:0%
me are you aware
 
04:54:32.510 --> 04:54:32.520 align:start position:0%
are there are there any
 
04:54:37.430 --> 04:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
other areas of where where a person who
 
04:54:39.868 --> 04:54:39.878 align:start position:0%
is injured can recover damages where
 
04:54:42.708 --> 04:54:42.718 align:start position:0%
there's no statute of limitations are
 
04:54:45.070 --> 04:54:45.080 align:start position:0%
you aware of any I mean would if we were
 
04:54:49.468 --> 04:54:49.478 align:start position:0%
to do this would would P be the the the
 
04:54:52.430 --> 04:54:52.440 align:start position:0%
only area in the law where there was no
 
04:54:53.830 --> 04:54:53.840 align:start position:0%
statute of
 
04:54:57.590 --> 04:54:57.600 align:start position:0%
limitations yes it would all right so if
 
04:55:01.868 --> 04:55:01.878 align:start position:0%
for example and I I mean if if
 
04:55:05.628 --> 04:55:05.638 align:start position:0%
uh if there's nuclear waste stored at
 
04:55:07.948 --> 04:55:07.958 align:start position:0%
sebr or something like that that causes
 
04:55:10.548 --> 04:55:10.558 align:start position:0%
injury I don't know I I don't know
 
04:55:11.750 --> 04:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
whether there's a federal statute
 
04:55:14.190 --> 04:55:14.200 align:start position:0%
dealing with that might be but but if at
 
04:55:15.948 --> 04:55:15.958 align:start position:0%
least for state law
 
04:55:18.948 --> 04:55:18.958 align:start position:0%
purposes there would be that that claim
 
04:55:22.230 --> 04:55:22.240 align:start position:0%
would be subject to the statute of
 
04:55:24.590 --> 04:55:24.600 align:start position:0%
limitations would you repeat that for me
 
04:55:25.830 --> 04:55:25.840 align:start position:0%
if somebody was injured if there was
 
04:55:29.628 --> 04:55:29.638 align:start position:0%
some Escape of uh nuclear material or
 
04:55:33.150 --> 04:55:33.160 align:start position:0%
nuclear fumes or whatever from seabook
 
04:55:36.548 --> 04:55:36.558 align:start position:0%
or or or maybe some some company that
 
04:55:39.110 --> 04:55:39.120 align:start position:0%
was transporting spent nuclear fuel
 
04:55:40.868 --> 04:55:40.878 align:start position:0%
through New Hampshire to move it to
 
04:55:43.230 --> 04:55:43.240 align:start position:0%
somewhere else and somebody was injured
 
04:55:44.910 --> 04:55:44.920 align:start position:0%
that claim would be there would be a
 
04:55:47.310 --> 04:55:47.320 align:start position:0%
statute of limitations for that claim
 
04:55:48.990 --> 04:55:49.000 align:start position:0%
but not for
 
04:55:52.270 --> 04:55:52.280 align:start position:0%
this in my opinion just you know not
 
04:55:54.150 --> 04:55:54.160 align:start position:0%
being somebody to make these kinds of
 
04:55:57.150 --> 04:55:57.160 align:start position:0%
decisions in a courtroom I would say
 
04:55:59.910 --> 04:55:59.920 align:start position:0%
that we would lookit we would look for
 
04:56:01.788 --> 04:56:01.798 align:start position:0%
some kind of release of statute of
 
04:56:03.750 --> 04:56:03.760 align:start position:0%
limitations in the law that's about
 
04:56:06.750 --> 04:56:06.760 align:start position:0%
nuclear waste and how that's treated or
 
04:56:10.350 --> 04:56:10.360 align:start position:0%
in the the
 
04:56:14.190 --> 04:56:14.200 align:start position:0%
operating um statutes for operating and
 
04:56:16.948 --> 04:56:16.958 align:start position:0%
disposing of nuclear waste that would be
 
04:56:19.708 --> 04:56:19.718 align:start position:0%
a completely different so this as I said
 
04:56:23.110 --> 04:56:23.120 align:start position:0%
lives right in its own area of Law and
 
04:56:28.070 --> 04:56:28.080 align:start position:0%
that area of law was created when people
 
04:56:31.310 --> 04:56:31.320 align:start position:0%
came into these committees from miramac
 
04:56:34.430 --> 04:56:34.440 align:start position:0%
and started filing bills about how they
 
04:56:38.670 --> 04:56:38.680 align:start position:0%
could get better remedies um if if I
 
04:56:40.788 --> 04:56:40.798 align:start position:0%
venture to say a little bit more there
 
04:56:43.708 --> 04:56:43.718 align:start position:0%
are several bills out there right now
 
04:56:46.310 --> 04:56:46.320 align:start position:0%
that are about quote unquote making
 
04:56:49.430 --> 04:56:49.440 align:start position:0%
polluters pay I'm not sure if this one
 
04:56:53.190 --> 04:56:53.200 align:start position:0%
is necessary but I do think we should
 
04:56:55.430 --> 04:56:55.440 align:start position:0%
pass it and we should make sure that it
 
04:56:59.468 --> 04:56:59.478 align:start position:0%
does what we expect it to do and that it
 
04:57:01.910 --> 04:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
only does it to the area of Statute and
 
04:57:03.670 --> 04:57:03.680 align:start position:0%
to the topic matter that we're talking
 
04:57:07.110 --> 04:57:07.120 align:start position:0%
about direct um if we can determine a
 
04:57:09.628 --> 04:57:09.638 align:start position:0%
cause or demonstrate an irrefutable
 
04:57:12.868 --> 04:57:12.878 align:start position:0%
relationship between the destruction of
 
04:57:15.510 --> 04:57:15.520 align:start position:0%
a water supply the cancer that someone's
 
04:57:17.510 --> 04:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
carrying in their body that they have a
 
04:57:19.270 --> 04:57:19.280 align:start position:0%
remedy for doing that and they have the
 
04:57:23.868 --> 04:57:23.878 align:start position:0%
time to do it so 2016
 
04:57:26.788 --> 04:57:26.798 align:start position:0%
17 was six years
 
04:57:28.708 --> 04:57:28.718 align:start position:0%
ago so it's
 
04:57:31.708 --> 04:57:31.718 align:start position:0%
over the first bill I did that time
 
04:57:34.868 --> 04:57:34.878 align:start position:0%
period for a lot of people they knew
 
04:57:36.468 --> 04:57:36.478 align:start position:0%
that they had a problem when they got
 
04:57:38.070 --> 04:57:38.080 align:start position:0%
that knock on the
 
04:57:40.230 --> 04:57:40.240 align:start position:0%
door that's when the clock starts
 
04:57:43.150 --> 04:57:43.160 align:start position:0%
running and I had spoken to colleagues
 
04:57:45.670 --> 04:57:45.680 align:start position:0%
on both sides of the aisle um the
 
04:57:48.590 --> 04:57:48.600 align:start position:0%
original bill was something that um our
 
04:57:51.548 --> 04:57:51.558 align:start position:0%
former speaker who was deceased
 
04:57:54.750 --> 04:57:54.760 align:start position:0%
unfortunately was um a co-sponsor of the
 
04:57:56.948 --> 04:57:56.958 align:start position:0%
bill and there are many ranking members
 
04:57:59.510 --> 04:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
on both sides of the aisle that will be
 
04:58:02.468 --> 04:58:02.478 align:start position:0%
in support of this and um the online
 
04:58:04.910 --> 04:58:04.920 align:start position:0%
testimony and the signin sheet should
 
04:58:04.920 --> 04:58:07.868 align:start position:0%
testimony and the signin sheet should
support

04:58:07.868 --> 04:58:07.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:10.868 --> 04:58:10.878 align:start position:0%
that yeah representative
 
04:58:14.510 --> 04:58:14.520 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you I'm I'm fascinated by
 
04:58:16.830 --> 04:58:16.840 align:start position:0%
this line of
 
04:58:21.350 --> 04:58:21.360 align:start position:0%
inquiry um as someone who actually has
 
04:58:24.468 --> 04:58:24.478 align:start position:0%
still not had occasion to try
 
04:58:29.270 --> 04:58:29.280 align:start position:0%
tobacco um and I'm not planning to was
 
04:58:32.190 --> 04:58:32.200 align:start position:0%
there a time
 
04:58:36.110 --> 04:58:36.120 align:start position:0%
limitation on all the tobacco suits I
 
04:58:41.910 --> 04:58:41.920 align:start position:0%
mean if I you would know more than I um
 
04:58:45.190 --> 04:58:45.200 align:start position:0%
you know I don't even play a lawyer on
 
04:58:48.750 --> 04:58:48.760 align:start position:0%
TV um but I was under the impression
 
04:58:51.310 --> 04:58:51.320 align:start position:0%
that there was no time limit I mean
 
04:58:54.510 --> 04:58:54.520 align:start position:0%
someone could have stopped smoking
 
04:58:56.948 --> 04:58:56.958 align:start position:0%
and as soon as they came home from World
 
04:58:59.628 --> 04:58:59.638 align:start position:0%
War II when so many people were in fact
 
04:59:01.390 --> 04:59:01.400 align:start position:0%
introduced to
 
04:59:04.510 --> 04:59:04.520 align:start position:0%
cigarettes um but would have been
 
04:59:04.520 --> 04:59:06.110 align:start position:0%
cigarettes um but would have been
eligible

04:59:06.110 --> 04:59:06.120 align:start position:0%
eligible
 
04:59:06.120 --> 04:59:07.868 align:start position:0%
eligible
for

04:59:07.868 --> 04:59:07.878 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:59:10.868 --> 04:59:10.878 align:start position:0%
compensation decades later isn't is am I
 
04:59:12.868 --> 04:59:12.878 align:start position:0%
wrong about that no I don't think you
 
04:59:14.270 --> 04:59:14.280 align:start position:0%
are but I think the it's not that
 
04:59:16.468 --> 04:59:16.478 align:start position:0%
there's no statute limitations I think
 
04:59:20.670 --> 04:59:20.680 align:start position:0%
the the the cause of action doesn't
 
04:59:26.708 --> 04:59:26.718 align:start position:0%
arise until you until you are sick and
 
04:59:31.548 --> 04:59:31.558 align:start position:0%
you can you can C you know trace the
 
04:59:34.190 --> 04:59:34.200 align:start position:0%
sickness to Tobacco so but isn't that
 
04:59:36.628 --> 04:59:36.638 align:start position:0%
the same situation we're facing here
 
04:59:41.910 --> 04:59:41.920 align:start position:0%
what happens is um as each month pass
 
04:59:46.670 --> 04:59:46.680 align:start position:0%
forget about year we learn more about
 
04:59:51.430 --> 04:59:51.440 align:start position:0%
these particular um chemicals and what
 
04:59:54.110 --> 04:59:54.120 align:start position:0%
uh I think what is a larger category
 
04:59:56.990 --> 04:59:57.000 align:start position:0%
that are referred to now increasingly as
 
05:00:00.548 --> 05:00:00.558 align:start position:0%
Forest forever chemicals because they
 
05:00:04.510 --> 05:00:04.520 align:start position:0%
don't because they are forever and and
 
05:00:07.350 --> 05:00:07.360 align:start position:0%
they um they're not so great for us I
 
05:00:10.510 --> 05:00:10.520 align:start position:0%
mean I you know I remember I remember
 
05:00:13.628 --> 05:00:13.638 align:start position:0%
thinking Teflon pans were great because
 
05:00:16.548 --> 05:00:16.558 align:start position:0%
I didn't have to use a lot of fat or oil
 
05:00:18.190 --> 05:00:18.200 align:start position:0%
things wouldn't stick to them wouldn't
 
05:00:20.990 --> 05:00:21.000 align:start position:0%
that be so healthy well guess
 
05:00:23.990 --> 05:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
what they're not so healthy but we
 
05:00:26.510 --> 05:00:26.520 align:start position:0%
didn't know that then and we do know it
 
05:00:30.110 --> 05:00:30.120 align:start position:0%
now and um that's probably an
 
05:00:32.910 --> 05:00:32.920 align:start position:0%
unimaginative example but it just shows
 
05:00:36.468 --> 05:00:36.478 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:40.990 --> 05:00:41.000 align:start position:0%
guess I I think it's the same situation
 
05:00:44.708 --> 05:00:44.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:48.030 --> 05:00:48.040 align:start position:0%
um yeah I mean I I guess I would say I I
 
05:00:50.628 --> 05:00:50.638 align:start position:0%
disagree for it because I think if
 
05:00:53.230 --> 05:00:53.240 align:start position:0%
that if
 
05:00:57.468 --> 05:00:57.478 align:start position:0%
the if you don't discover that you're in
 
05:00:58.910 --> 05:00:58.920 align:start position:0%
injured from
 
05:01:02.750 --> 05:01:02.760 align:start position:0%
P um or have uh if you don't discover
 
05:01:04.310 --> 05:01:04.320 align:start position:0%
that you're injured number one and
 
05:01:08.430 --> 05:01:08.440 align:start position:0%
number two that it's tied to past for
 
05:01:11.390 --> 05:01:11.400 align:start position:0%
some you know some period into the
 
05:01:15.070 --> 05:01:15.080 align:start position:0%
future then that's when when you as I
 
05:01:16.750 --> 05:01:16.760 align:start position:0%
understand a l when the statute
 
05:01:19.350 --> 05:01:19.360 align:start position:0%
limitations begins to run when you know
 
05:01:20.590 --> 05:01:20.600 align:start position:0%
or should have known that you've been
 
05:01:22.788 --> 05:01:22.798 align:start position:0%
injured and that you were the injury was
 
05:01:22.798 --> 05:01:23.990 align:start position:0%
injured and that you were the injury was
caused

05:01:23.990 --> 05:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
caused
 
05:01:27.150 --> 05:01:27.160 align:start position:0%
by what you're suing about that's I
 
05:01:28.350 --> 05:01:28.360 align:start position:0%
think that's would be the same for
 
05:01:31.910 --> 05:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
tobacco for p i mean under existing law
 
05:01:36.948 --> 05:01:36.958 align:start position:0%
for tobacco for P for for for whatever
 
05:01:40.590 --> 05:01:40.600 align:start position:0%
um and I don't think I mean I unless at
 
05:01:42.110 --> 05:01:42.120 align:start position:0%
least in New Hampshire I don't think
 
05:01:44.310 --> 05:01:44.320 align:start position:0%
that there's any you know that we have a
 
05:01:45.750 --> 05:01:45.760 align:start position:0%
law in New Hampshire that says there's
 
05:01:48.190 --> 05:01:48.200 align:start position:0%
no statute limitations for example for
 
05:01:49.830 --> 05:01:49.840 align:start position:0%
tobacco injuries I don't think that
 
05:01:51.430 --> 05:01:51.440 align:start position:0%
that's that that's the
 
05:01:54.590 --> 05:01:54.600 align:start position:0%
law representative Divine staying on
 
05:01:58.350 --> 05:01:58.360 align:start position:0%
this topic would there be um any
 
05:02:00.830 --> 05:02:00.840 align:start position:0%
uh sorts of statues on say asbest where
 
05:02:04.310 --> 05:02:04.320 align:start position:0%
there was asbest dumped say in
 
05:02:07.230 --> 05:02:07.240 align:start position:0%
nashwa um around New Soul school about
 
05:02:11.430 --> 05:02:11.440 align:start position:0%
oh God 30 40 50 years ago so to me I
 
05:02:13.628 --> 05:02:13.638 align:start position:0%
don't and there's ASB bestus cases that
 
05:02:15.190 --> 05:02:15.200 align:start position:0%
go on throughout the country would you
 
05:02:18.310 --> 05:02:18.320 align:start position:0%
see this very similar to what that was
 
05:02:19.788 --> 05:02:19.798 align:start position:0%
and I don't know if there's any statues
 
05:02:21.708 --> 05:02:21.718 align:start position:0%
for that but ASB bestus was a big thing
 
05:02:22.948 --> 05:02:22.958 align:start position:0%
for a long time there's a lot of
 
05:02:24.830 --> 05:02:24.840 align:start position:0%
litigation it goes for years and years
 
05:02:24.840 --> 05:02:26.350 align:start position:0%
litigation it goes for years and years
and

05:02:26.350 --> 05:02:26.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:02:26.360 --> 05:02:29.548 align:start position:0%
and
years

05:02:29.548 --> 05:02:29.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:32.230 --> 05:02:32.240 align:start position:0%
so I'm just trying to pull a question
 
05:02:35.750 --> 05:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
let's see an answer out of that
 
05:02:39.270 --> 05:02:39.280 align:start position:0%
um I don't see it as the same I see it
 
05:02:39.280 --> 05:02:40.788 align:start position:0%
um I don't see it as the same I see it
as

05:02:40.788 --> 05:02:40.798 align:start position:0%
as
 
05:02:43.310 --> 05:02:43.320 align:start position:0%
you are living with something you're
 
05:02:45.150 --> 05:02:45.160 align:start position:0%
learning about something you're learning
 
05:02:47.350 --> 05:02:47.360 align:start position:0%
that there's a contamination Zone that
 
05:02:50.110 --> 05:02:50.120 align:start position:0%
some of the impacts on your community
 
05:02:55.830 --> 05:02:55.840 align:start position:0%
are being um addressed but many are not
 
05:02:58.390 --> 05:02:58.400 align:start position:0%
the zone of contamination
 
05:02:58.400 --> 05:03:00.030 align:start position:0%
the zone of contamination
is

05:03:00.030 --> 05:03:00.040 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:03:03.150 --> 05:03:03.160 align:start position:0%
includes areas and excludes a lot of
 
05:03:05.510 --> 05:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
areas that are probably very active and
 
05:03:08.990 --> 05:03:09.000 align:start position:0%
it's based on how your well how many
 
05:03:12.150 --> 05:03:12.160 align:start position:0%
Wells we can test at a time and how many
 
05:03:14.708 --> 05:03:14.718 align:start position:0%
how many people do we determine need an
 
05:03:17.868 --> 05:03:17.878 align:start position:0%
alternative water supply so there's
 
05:03:20.430 --> 05:03:20.440 align:start position:0%
things I mean there's just a a lot going
 
05:03:23.390 --> 05:03:23.400 align:start position:0%
on I I we do find ASB bestus everywhere
 
05:03:27.468 --> 05:03:27.478 align:start position:0%
we do know that it's a um a contaminant
 
05:03:29.830 --> 05:03:29.840 align:start position:0%
and we know that it's everywhere and
 
05:03:32.230 --> 05:03:32.240 align:start position:0%
we're trying to deal with it and help
 
05:03:35.750 --> 05:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
people deal with their mesothelioma and
 
05:03:37.990 --> 05:03:38.000 align:start position:0%
other um disorders that come from
 
05:03:41.310 --> 05:03:41.320 align:start position:0%
inhaling ASB bestus or being around it
 
05:03:44.310 --> 05:03:44.320 align:start position:0%
but I think with this this is you know
 
05:03:45.910 --> 05:03:45.920 align:start position:0%
as best as was thought to be the
 
05:03:48.868 --> 05:03:48.878 align:start position:0%
greatest thing um and that can sound
 
05:03:52.910 --> 05:03:52.920 align:start position:0%
like Teflon except that St gobain was
 
05:03:55.788 --> 05:03:55.798 align:start position:0%
here after they had to leave HK Falls
 
05:03:59.310 --> 05:03:59.320 align:start position:0%
New York because they had statutes that
 
05:04:02.150 --> 05:04:02.160 align:start position:0%
would no longer tolerate the pollution
 
05:04:03.948 --> 05:04:03.958 align:start position:0%
and that the same thing in Bennington
 
05:04:06.708 --> 05:04:06.718 align:start position:0%
Vermont with st gobain and they came to
 
05:04:08.150 --> 05:04:08.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and they knew what they
 
05:04:10.310 --> 05:04:10.320 align:start position:0%
were doing they had been out in other
 
05:04:14.190 --> 05:04:14.200 align:start position:0%
states they have longterm information
 
05:04:17.830 --> 05:04:17.840 align:start position:0%
about the the impacts of pasas the
 
05:04:21.070 --> 05:04:21.080 align:start position:0%
industry going all the way back to 3M
 
05:04:24.788 --> 05:04:24.798 align:start position:0%
and other companies in the 60s the 70s
 
05:04:27.670 --> 05:04:27.680 align:start position:0%
they knew about this in the 50s they
 
05:04:30.788 --> 05:04:30.798 align:start position:0%
knew about it in the 60s and they just
 
05:04:33.868 --> 05:04:33.878 align:start position:0%
kept on going and all of us know that we
 
05:04:38.270 --> 05:04:38.280 align:start position:0%
were told that the um Teflon pans were
 
05:04:40.708 --> 05:04:40.718 align:start position:0%
bad but then they came out with a
 
05:04:42.948 --> 05:04:42.958 align:start position:0%
replacement so this is kind of what the
 
05:04:46.270 --> 05:04:46.280 align:start position:0%
game has been it's almost like okay well
 
05:04:48.948 --> 05:04:48.958 align:start position:0%
originally there's two pases that are
 
05:04:51.788 --> 05:04:51.798 align:start position:0%
thought to be the most evil of all of
 
05:04:55.430 --> 05:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
them and that's the pfos and the
 
05:04:58.590 --> 05:04:58.600 align:start position:0%
pfoa but when you make Gen X so you can
 
05:05:00.788 --> 05:05:00.798 align:start position:0%
still make those codings but you can say
 
05:05:02.750 --> 05:05:02.760 align:start position:0%
well this isn't the same molecule and it
 
05:05:04.270 --> 05:05:04.280 align:start position:0%
can't be restricted and it's not going
 
05:05:06.150 --> 05:05:06.160 align:start position:0%
to do the same thing to
 
05:05:09.628 --> 05:05:09.638 align:start position:0%
you those assertions need to be either
 
05:05:12.110 --> 05:05:12.120 align:start position:0%
supported or they need to be dispelled
 
05:05:14.830 --> 05:05:14.840 align:start position:0%
and this is a situation where the where
 
05:05:17.868 --> 05:05:17.878 align:start position:0%
the company has stepped up but only
 
05:05:19.910 --> 05:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
after being dragged into the courtroom
 
05:05:22.910 --> 05:05:22.920 align:start position:0%
and signing dis consent decrees with
 
05:05:25.350 --> 05:05:25.360 align:start position:0%
towns like marac that are you know
 
05:05:29.468 --> 05:05:29.478 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:32.230 --> 05:05:32.240 align:start position:0%
private Wells that are all over the
 
05:05:34.270 --> 05:05:34.280 align:start position:0%
region and you know we still need to
 
05:05:36.350 --> 05:05:36.360 align:start position:0%
test we still need to catch up there's
 
05:05:39.110 --> 05:05:39.120 align:start position:0%
just the science is still catching up on
 
05:05:40.868 --> 05:05:40.878 align:start position:0%
the health impacts we're starting to
 
05:05:43.548 --> 05:05:43.558 align:start position:0%
gather data in New Hampshire from the
 
05:05:46.948 --> 05:05:46.958 align:start position:0%
mayor Matt cluster and from the cluster
 
05:05:49.590 --> 05:05:49.600 align:start position:0%
that's near the kle landfill so these
 
05:05:49.600 --> 05:05:50.750 align:start position:0%
that's near the kle landfill so these
kinds

05:05:50.750 --> 05:05:50.760 align:start position:0%
kinds
 
05:05:54.510 --> 05:05:54.520 align:start position:0%
of empirical data are coming in now we
 
05:05:56.030 --> 05:05:56.040 align:start position:0%
didn't have that till we started
 
05:05:57.670 --> 05:05:57.680 align:start position:0%
collecting it we couldn't collect it
 
05:06:00.788 --> 05:06:00.798 align:start position:0%
until we made a statute to collect it so
 
05:06:02.788 --> 05:06:02.798 align:start position:0%
thank you all right other questions for
 
05:06:05.590 --> 05:06:05.600 align:start position:0%
this witness seeing none thank you very
 
05:06:08.390 --> 05:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
much thank you so much I appreciate your
 
05:06:22.030 --> 05:06:22.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:25.190 --> 05:06:25.200 align:start position:0%
service thank you thank you Mr chairman
 
05:06:28.150 --> 05:06:28.160 align:start position:0%
and honorable MERS press the but oh oh
 
05:06:29.230 --> 05:06:29.240 align:start position:0%
okay there it
 
05:06:31.750 --> 05:06:31.760 align:start position:0%
is thank you Mr chairman and honorable
 
05:06:35.070 --> 05:06:35.080 align:start position:0%
members of uh this committee um yeah uh
 
05:06:37.350 --> 05:06:37.360 align:start position:0%
my name is Chris SRA I'm a student at
 
05:06:39.468 --> 05:06:39.478 align:start position:0%
Philips exitor in exitor New Hampshire
 
05:06:41.670 --> 05:06:41.680 align:start position:0%
and I'm originally from New Jersey and
 
05:06:44.230 --> 05:06:44.240 align:start position:0%
today I believe we're uh at a critical
 
05:06:46.430 --> 05:06:46.440 align:start position:0%
juncture in our collectives surrounding
 
05:06:48.030 --> 05:06:48.040 align:start position:0%
uh safeguarding public health and
 
05:06:50.190 --> 05:06:50.200 align:start position:0%
protecting our environment uh as we just
 
05:06:53.830 --> 05:06:53.840 align:start position:0%
know um are confronted by a silent uh
 
05:06:55.510 --> 05:06:55.520 align:start position:0%
but I believe to be Insidious threat
 
05:06:57.750 --> 05:06:57.760 align:start position:0%
lurking within our communities per and
 
05:07:01.270 --> 05:07:01.280 align:start position:0%
poly floral alkal substances known as
 
05:07:04.310 --> 05:07:04.320 align:start position:0%
pasas or pfas U and they are found as
 
05:07:05.868 --> 05:07:05.878 align:start position:0%
people have already mention in all kinds
 
05:07:07.750 --> 05:07:07.760 align:start position:0%
of products from uh things like
 
05:07:10.350 --> 05:07:10.360 align:start position:0%
non-stick pans to firefighting foam uh
 
05:07:12.468 --> 05:07:12.478 align:start position:0%
to waterproof clothing and uh these
 
05:07:14.390 --> 05:07:14.400 align:start position:0%
chemicals have seeped into our water
 
05:07:18.310 --> 05:07:18.320 align:start position:0%
systems uh and have infiltrated over 97%
 
05:07:20.390 --> 05:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
of people all around the world um
 
05:07:22.150 --> 05:07:22.160 align:start position:0%
resulting in some health implications
 
05:07:25.390 --> 05:07:25.400 align:start position:0%
I'll discuss later on I posit that house
 
05:07:27.590 --> 05:07:27.600 align:start position:0%
build 1089 represents
 
05:07:29.788 --> 05:07:29.798 align:start position:0%
a pivotal step towards confronting this
 
05:07:32.070 --> 05:07:32.080 align:start position:0%
threat headon and we're taking a step
 
05:07:34.270 --> 05:07:34.280 align:start position:0%
towards the justice that the victims of
 
05:07:36.708 --> 05:07:36.718 align:start position:0%
these substances deserve um as I
 
05:07:38.468 --> 05:07:38.478 align:start position:0%
mentioned I think it's very important to
 
05:07:40.310 --> 05:07:40.320 align:start position:0%
examine some of the medical research
 
05:07:42.868 --> 05:07:42.878 align:start position:0%
done on this topic um pasas has been
 
05:07:45.310 --> 05:07:45.320 align:start position:0%
linked to higher rates of varying types
 
05:07:49.030 --> 05:07:49.040 align:start position:0%
of cancer from liver uh cancer to
 
05:07:51.708 --> 05:07:51.718 align:start position:0%
hyperthyroidism um in a recent study um
 
05:07:54.310 --> 05:07:54.320 align:start position:0%
from the National Institute of Health uh
 
05:07:56.868 --> 05:07:56.878 align:start position:0%
they examine the effects on heavily
 
05:07:58.948 --> 05:07:58.958 align:start position:0%
exposed workers and I detected a
 
05:08:00.990 --> 05:08:01.000 align:start position:0%
significantly increased death rate um
 
05:08:03.510 --> 05:08:03.520 align:start position:0%
compared to those who were exposed less
 
05:08:06.310 --> 05:08:06.320 align:start position:0%
um another link that I saw um was
 
05:08:08.868 --> 05:08:08.878 align:start position:0%
between pasas and developmental issues
 
05:08:11.230 --> 05:08:11.240 align:start position:0%
and birth effects in infants um one
 
05:08:14.270 --> 05:08:14.280 align:start position:0%
study examined over 500,000 mothers and
 
05:08:16.548 --> 05:08:16.558 align:start position:0%
children and found a link between pasas
 
05:08:18.708 --> 05:08:18.718 align:start position:0%
and many conditions from congenital
 
05:08:20.910 --> 05:08:20.920 align:start position:0%
heart defects to cleft
 
05:08:23.830 --> 05:08:23.840 align:start position:0%
lips and I want you to know in this room
 
05:08:25.750 --> 05:08:25.760 align:start position:0%
uh that past chemicals are not just
 
05:08:27.990 --> 05:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
another Environmental concern there are
 
05:08:30.190 --> 05:08:30.200 align:start position:0%
clear and present danger to the public
 
05:08:32.270 --> 05:08:32.280 align:start position:0%
health of New Hampshire individuals and
 
05:08:34.350 --> 05:08:34.360 align:start position:0%
I don't think that the health risks can
 
05:08:36.350 --> 05:08:36.360 align:start position:0%
be overstated and The Time for Action is
 
05:08:39.468 --> 05:08:39.478 align:start position:0%
now uh as a conservative myself I see
 
05:08:41.670 --> 05:08:41.680 align:start position:0%
that Republicans often advocate for the
 
05:08:43.468 --> 05:08:43.478 align:start position:0%
protection of our natural rights and
 
05:08:45.030 --> 05:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
advocate for limited government
 
05:08:47.350 --> 05:08:47.360 align:start position:0%
intervention and I do really value these
 
05:08:49.990 --> 05:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
items however past contamination
 
05:08:51.548 --> 05:08:51.558 align:start position:0%
infringes upon these rights by
 
05:08:53.948 --> 05:08:53.958 align:start position:0%
contaminating private property and poses
 
05:08:55.948 --> 05:08:55.958 align:start position:0%
risk to the health and well-being of
 
05:08:58.590 --> 05:08:58.600 align:start position:0%
Americans this is a case where I believe
 
05:09:00.708 --> 05:09:00.718 align:start position:0%
government intervention is Justified and
 
05:09:02.310 --> 05:09:02.320 align:start position:0%
where we must put aside our political
 
05:09:04.468 --> 05:09:04.478 align:start position:0%
differences to protect the
 
05:09:07.510 --> 05:09:07.520 align:start position:0%
people and certainly some may argue that
 
05:09:09.670 --> 05:09:09.680 align:start position:0%
regulation uh stifles economic growth
 
05:09:11.628 --> 05:09:11.638 align:start position:0%
and burdens businesses with undue
 
05:09:13.868 --> 05:09:13.878 align:start position:0%
restrictions however what price can we
 
05:09:15.390 --> 05:09:15.400 align:start position:0%
place on the health and well-being of
 
05:09:18.628 --> 05:09:18.638 align:start position:0%
our citizens can we in good conscience
 
05:09:21.468 --> 05:09:21.478 align:start position:0%
prioritize short-term convenience over
 
05:09:24.310 --> 05:09:24.320 align:start position:0%
the long-term health of our communities
 
05:09:27.510 --> 05:09:27.520 align:start position:0%
and we must stop past now um as these
 
05:09:29.310 --> 05:09:29.320 align:start position:0%
persistent chemicals pervade and
 
05:09:32.150 --> 05:09:32.160 align:start position:0%
accumulate um being named uh forever
 
05:09:34.230 --> 05:09:34.240 align:start position:0%
chemicals and I do hope that you will
 
05:09:36.830 --> 05:09:36.840 align:start position:0%
stand with me in support and truly uh
 
05:09:39.390 --> 05:09:39.400 align:start position:0%
value the importance of human lives that
 
05:09:42.270 --> 05:09:42.280 align:start position:0%
have been and will be affected by past
 
05:09:45.548 --> 05:09:45.558 align:start position:0%
contamination as a 17-year-old myself I
 
05:09:47.788 --> 05:09:47.798 align:start position:0%
hope that our state legislators uh like
 
05:09:50.070 --> 05:09:50.080 align:start position:0%
yall uh work towards reform in some sort
 
05:09:52.270 --> 05:09:52.280 align:start position:0%
of way uh that will protect generations
 
05:09:54.708 --> 05:09:54.718 align:start position:0%
to come um and promote environmental
 
05:09:57.230 --> 05:09:57.240 align:start position:0%
Integrity so thank you so much
 
05:09:59.390 --> 05:09:59.400 align:start position:0%
questions for this
 
05:10:01.868 --> 05:10:01.878 align:start position:0%
witness thank you sir you oh I'm sorry
 
05:10:05.110 --> 05:10:05.120 align:start position:0%
yes represent one comment um would you
 
05:10:07.510 --> 05:10:07.520 align:start position:0%
believe that the EPA was started by a
 
05:10:11.110 --> 05:10:11.120 align:start position:0%
conservative president certainly yeah I
 
05:10:13.548 --> 05:10:13.558 align:start position:0%
yeah the EPA and many of the first
 
05:10:15.628 --> 05:10:15.638 align:start position:0%
environmental acts the Clean Air Act uh
 
05:10:18.310 --> 05:10:18.320 align:start position:0%
Clean Water Act were uh very bipartisan
 
05:10:19.990 --> 05:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
and actually led by a conservative
 
05:10:23.110 --> 05:10:23.120 align:start position:0%
majority which yeah so yeah thank you
 
05:10:25.390 --> 05:10:25.400 align:start position:0%
other questions seeing none thank you
 
05:10:28.230 --> 05:10:28.240 align:start position:0%
very much next I'm going to call uh
 
05:10:38.150 --> 05:10:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:41.430 --> 05:10:41.440 align:start position:0%
please we can hear you
 
05:10:44.548 --> 05:10:44.558 align:start position:0%
so there you go thank you I have copies
 
05:10:46.468 --> 05:10:46.478 align:start position:0%
if any of you want I don't have enough
 
05:10:49.510 --> 05:10:49.520 align:start position:0%
for everyone but that's okay just we'll
 
05:10:50.990 --> 05:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
yeah we'll we'll figure out a way to
 
05:10:55.548 --> 05:10:55.558 align:start position:0%
handle that thank you yeah
 
05:10:55.558 --> 05:10:59.030 align:start position:0%
handle that thank you yeah
course

05:10:59.030 --> 05:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:00.910 --> 05:11:00.920 align:start position:0%
um good afternoon Mr chairman and
 
05:11:03.070 --> 05:11:03.080 align:start position:0%
honorable members of the committee thank
 
05:11:04.708 --> 05:11:04.718 align:start position:0%
you for giving me the opportunity to
 
05:11:07.468 --> 05:11:07.478 align:start position:0%
speak alongside Chris my name is ginina
 
05:11:09.590 --> 05:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
Kuba and I'm also a senior at Philips
 
05:11:12.270 --> 05:11:12.280 align:start position:0%
exitor Academy but Virginia Beach is my
 
05:11:14.868 --> 05:11:14.878 align:start position:0%
home I'm here to testify and support of
 
05:11:17.390 --> 05:11:17.400 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1089 to remove the current
 
05:11:19.390 --> 05:11:19.400 align:start position:0%
six-year statue of limitations on
 
05:11:22.270 --> 05:11:22.280 align:start position:0%
damages caused by past
 
05:11:25.230 --> 05:11:25.240 align:start position:0%
exposure as Chris mentioned pasas is a
 
05:11:26.990 --> 05:11:27.000 align:start position:0%
group of synthetic chemicals using
 
05:11:29.190 --> 05:11:29.200 align:start position:0%
various industrial and consumer products
 
05:11:31.548 --> 05:11:31.558 align:start position:0%
due to their water and grease resistant
 
05:11:33.948 --> 05:11:33.958 align:start position:0%
properties although pasas can be useful
 
05:11:36.070 --> 05:11:36.080 align:start position:0%
in application the effects are
 
05:11:38.190 --> 05:11:38.200 align:start position:0%
horrifying what is so dangerous about
 
05:11:40.788 --> 05:11:40.798 align:start position:0%
past is how little we know about it the
 
05:11:43.990 --> 05:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
extent of its destruction despite its UB
 
05:11:47.070 --> 05:11:47.080 align:start position:0%
ubiquity there's past in my blood yours
 
05:11:49.310 --> 05:11:49.320 align:start position:0%
and everyone in this room it is not a
 
05:11:51.110 --> 05:11:51.120 align:start position:0%
natural chemical it is found in our
 
05:11:53.468 --> 05:11:53.478 align:start position:0%
bodies and like people have mentioned it
 
05:11:57.590 --> 05:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
lasts forever how scary is that
 
05:12:00.510 --> 05:12:00.520 align:start position:0%
of the 9,000 known past compounds 600
 
05:12:02.030 --> 05:12:02.040 align:start position:0%
are currently used in a multiple
 
05:12:03.990 --> 05:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
multitude of products and goods in the
 
05:12:06.830 --> 05:12:06.840 align:start position:0%
US this includes food packaging
 
05:12:09.590 --> 05:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
firefighting foam dental floss carpets
 
05:12:13.350 --> 05:12:13.360 align:start position:0%
clothing and the list goes on P chem
 
05:12:15.548 --> 05:12:15.558 align:start position:0%
chemicals contain a carbon Florine bond
 
05:12:17.590 --> 05:12:17.600 align:start position:0%
which is an incredibly strong bond and
 
05:12:19.110 --> 05:12:19.120 align:start position:0%
therefore when pasas enters the
 
05:12:20.990 --> 05:12:21.000 align:start position:0%
environment the environment is unable to
 
05:12:22.990 --> 05:12:23.000 align:start position:0%
break apart the bond causing the
 
05:12:24.830 --> 05:12:24.840 align:start position:0%
quantity of pasas in the environment to
 
05:12:28.030 --> 05:12:28.040 align:start position:0%
build up aside from usage pasas is
 
05:12:30.230 --> 05:12:30.240 align:start position:0%
virtually everywhere industrial
 
05:12:32.708 --> 05:12:32.718 align:start position:0%
processes use past and these sites often
 
05:12:36.270 --> 05:12:36.280 align:start position:0%
release pasas into the water or air past
 
05:12:37.830 --> 05:12:37.840 align:start position:0%
contamination of water happens
 
05:12:39.990 --> 05:12:40.000 align:start position:0%
frequently near industrial facilities
 
05:12:41.948 --> 05:12:41.958 align:start position:0%
military bases and areas where
 
05:12:44.190 --> 05:12:44.200 align:start position:0%
firefighting Foams containing past have
 
05:12:46.868 --> 05:12:46.878 align:start position:0%
been used years of this have occurred at
 
05:12:48.830 --> 05:12:48.840 align:start position:0%
our very own peace Air National Guard
 
05:12:51.468 --> 05:12:51.478 align:start position:0%
base where soil and groundwater were
 
05:12:53.830 --> 05:12:53.840 align:start position:0%
contaminated it is not only Public Water
 
05:12:56.990 --> 05:12:57.000 align:start position:0%
Supplies private Wells also contain p
 
05:12:59.430 --> 05:12:59.440 align:start position:0%
contamination the exposure to pasas is
 
05:13:01.430 --> 05:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
much broader than you might think even
 
05:13:03.590 --> 05:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
Beyond drinking water it's in our food
 
05:13:07.030 --> 05:13:07.040 align:start position:0%
and household products I ask you today
 
05:13:09.390 --> 05:13:09.400 align:start position:0%
why take that risk human life is
 
05:13:11.590 --> 05:13:11.600 align:start position:0%
precious and it is only just that we
 
05:13:14.030 --> 05:13:14.040 align:start position:0%
respect and acknowledge that inherent
 
05:13:16.390 --> 05:13:16.400 align:start position:0%
value particularly when it comes to
 
05:13:18.708 --> 05:13:18.718 align:start position:0%
health concerns we do not know when we
 
05:13:20.788 --> 05:13:20.798 align:start position:0%
might observe the manifestation of the
 
05:13:23.310 --> 05:13:23.320 align:start position:0%
effects of pasas and it is essential we
 
05:13:25.350 --> 05:13:25.360 align:start position:0%
give our citizens and communities that
 
05:13:28.510 --> 05:13:28.520 align:start position:0%
Liberty aside from the ecological degrad
 
05:13:31.350 --> 05:13:31.360 align:start position:0%
degradation pasas causes we are coming
 
05:13:33.708 --> 05:13:33.718 align:start position:0%
to learn more and more about how pasas
 
05:13:35.830 --> 05:13:35.840 align:start position:0%
is affecting the Public's
 
05:13:38.468 --> 05:13:38.478 align:start position:0%
Health in a recent study published in
 
05:13:40.270 --> 05:13:40.280 align:start position:0%
environmental health insights
 
05:13:42.030 --> 05:13:42.040 align:start position:0%
researchers found that in Southern New
 
05:13:44.830 --> 05:13:44.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in marac residents had higher
 
05:13:46.788 --> 05:13:46.798 align:start position:0%
rates of thyroid cancer than national
 
05:13:49.190 --> 05:13:49.200 align:start position:0%
average and particularly higher rates of
 
05:13:51.788 --> 05:13:51.798 align:start position:0%
thyroid colon and prostate cancer
 
05:13:53.788 --> 05:13:53.798 align:start position:0%
compared to nearby towns that did not
 
05:13:56.868 --> 05:13:56.878 align:start position:0%
have high levels of past exposure marac
 
05:13:59.030 --> 05:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
is home to a factory that produces past
 
05:14:03.670 --> 05:14:03.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:06.030 --> 05:14:06.040 align:start position:0%
fabrics it's not just ordinary people
 
05:14:07.990 --> 05:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
like my myself who know the effects of
 
05:14:10.190 --> 05:14:10.200 align:start position:0%
past but the companies who are using and
 
05:14:12.310 --> 05:14:12.320 align:start position:0%
unleashing these chemicals as well
 
05:14:14.110 --> 05:14:14.120 align:start position:0%
Dupont Chemical Company is one of the
 
05:14:16.468 --> 05:14:16.478 align:start position:0%
largest chemical companies in the world
 
05:14:22.190 --> 05:14:22.200 align:start position:0%
in 1951 Dupont began purchasing plur FL
 
05:14:25.270 --> 05:14:25.280 align:start position:0%
octenic acid or PFO for use in
 
05:14:27.548 --> 05:14:27.558 align:start position:0%
manufacturing tough Fon a synthetic
 
05:14:29.030 --> 05:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
floral polymer known for its
 
05:14:31.350 --> 05:14:31.360 align:start position:0%
non-sticking properties instead of
 
05:14:33.548 --> 05:14:33.558 align:start position:0%
properly disposing of it deont dumped
 
05:14:35.510 --> 05:14:35.520 align:start position:0%
thousands of pounds of chemical into the
 
05:14:37.910 --> 05:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
Ohio river and pits into which seeped
 
05:14:39.510 --> 05:14:39.520 align:start position:0%
into the ground and contaminated the
 
05:14:41.468 --> 05:14:41.478 align:start position:0%
drinking water of nearby
 
05:14:44.110 --> 05:14:44.120 align:start position:0%
communities at the same time deont was
 
05:14:45.948 --> 05:14:45.958 align:start position:0%
conducting researches research in the
 
05:14:48.868 --> 05:14:48.878 align:start position:0%
1960s on pasas and knew that it caused
 
05:14:52.030 --> 05:14:52.040 align:start position:0%
organ damage in animals in the 1970s
 
05:14:53.670 --> 05:14:53.680 align:start position:0%
dupon also discovered that there were
 
05:14:55.670 --> 05:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
high concentrations of toxic chemicals
 
05:14:57.510 --> 05:14:57.520 align:start position:0%
in the blood of their workers and did
 
05:15:00.270 --> 05:15:00.280 align:start position:0%
not notify their workers of this then in
 
05:15:02.590 --> 05:15:02.600 align:start position:0%
the 1980s defont confirmed that the
 
05:15:04.390 --> 05:15:04.400 align:start position:0%
chemical was a affecting the health of
 
05:15:06.390 --> 05:15:06.400 align:start position:0%
their workers and found defects in the
 
05:15:08.868 --> 05:15:08.878 align:start position:0%
babies of their pregnant employees and
 
05:15:10.708 --> 05:15:10.718 align:start position:0%
even after all this Dupont did not make
 
05:15:13.948 --> 05:15:13.958 align:start position:0%
the information public by the 1990s
 
05:15:16.670 --> 05:15:16.680 align:start position:0%
deont knew that pasas caused cancerous
 
05:15:19.510 --> 05:15:19.520 align:start position:0%
test testicular pancreatic and liver
 
05:15:23.150 --> 05:15:23.160 align:start position:0%
tubers in lab animals finally in 2006
 
05:15:25.468 --> 05:15:25.478 align:start position:0%
depart reached a $16.5 million
 
05:15:27.310 --> 05:15:27.320 align:start position:0%
settlement with Environmental Protection
 
05:15:29.628 --> 05:15:29.638 align:start position:0%
Agency for concealing information and
 
05:15:33.270 --> 05:15:33.280 align:start position:0%
knowledge about P's toxicity the $16.5
 
05:15:36.150 --> 05:15:36.160 align:start position:0%
million siment represented less than 2%
 
05:15:38.788 --> 05:15:38.798 align:start position:0%
of the company's profits that year dupon
 
05:15:40.350 --> 05:15:40.360 align:start position:0%
has been found liable for the health of
 
05:15:41.590 --> 05:15:41.600 align:start position:0%
thousands of
 
05:15:46.910 --> 05:15:46.920 align:start position:0%
plff all for what profit to me that is
 
05:15:49.868 --> 05:15:49.878 align:start position:0%
inexcusable it took only it took over 50
 
05:15:51.750 --> 05:15:51.760 align:start position:0%
years of suffering for so many innocent
 
05:15:53.430 --> 05:15:53.440 align:start position:0%
civilians to have their Humanity
 
05:15:55.468 --> 05:15:55.478 align:start position:0%
recognized many will never even know
 
05:15:58.350 --> 05:15:58.360 align:start position:0%
about the harm done to them furthermore
 
05:16:00.590 --> 05:16:00.600 align:start position:0%
6 years is merely a drop in this pool of
 
05:16:03.910 --> 05:16:03.920 align:start position:0%
chemical waste destruction and greed I
 
05:16:05.788 --> 05:16:05.798 align:start position:0%
believe in this fundamental recognition
 
05:16:08.310 --> 05:16:08.320 align:start position:0%
of people's autonomy and well-being
 
05:16:10.310 --> 05:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
people like myself do not even have a
 
05:16:12.310 --> 05:16:12.320 align:start position:0%
sliver of the influence and power that
 
05:16:12.320 --> 05:16:13.350 align:start position:0%
sliver of the influence and power that
Dupont

05:16:13.350 --> 05:16:13.360 align:start position:0%
Dupont
 
05:16:15.430 --> 05:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
possesses and that is why we come to the
 
05:16:17.548 --> 05:16:17.558 align:start position:0%
law to provide us with the hope of
 
05:16:19.708 --> 05:16:19.718 align:start position:0%
challenging power structures dominant in
 
05:16:22.468 --> 05:16:22.478 align:start position:0%
our socioeconomic conditions thank you

hopefully I can answer some of the

questions came up during the first round
 
05:18:00.510 --> 05:18:00.520 align:start position:0%
with uh the representative uh sponsor my
 
05:18:02.670 --> 05:18:02.680 align:start position:0%
goal here is to explain the vital role
 
05:18:04.788 --> 05:18:04.798 align:start position:0%
statutes of limitation play in New
 
05:18:06.708 --> 05:18:06.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and in every State's Civil
 
05:18:09.110 --> 05:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
Justice System and to provide a national
 
05:18:11.110 --> 05:18:11.120 align:start position:0%
perspective on attempts like the one in
 
05:18:13.548 --> 05:18:13.558 align:start position:0%
this bill to eliminate a statute of
 
05:18:16.310 --> 05:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
limitations first and foremost statutes
 
05:18:18.510 --> 05:18:18.520 align:start position:0%
of limitations whether two years 3 years
 
05:18:20.750 --> 05:18:20.760 align:start position:0%
or here six years are an essential
 
05:18:22.788 --> 05:18:22.798 align:start position:0%
element of a properly functioning Civil
 
05:18:25.190 --> 05:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
Justice System they allow judges and
 
05:18:27.468 --> 05:18:27.478 align:start position:0%
juries to evaluate liability when the
 
05:18:29.390 --> 05:18:29.400 align:start position:0%
best evidence is available before
 
05:18:31.628 --> 05:18:31.638 align:start position:0%
records are discarded or Witnesses pass
 
05:18:34.110 --> 05:18:34.120 align:start position:0%
away or can no longer be located as the
 
05:18:35.750 --> 05:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Supreme Court has
 
05:18:38.110 --> 05:18:38.120 align:start position:0%
repeatedly emphasized the primary
 
05:18:40.270 --> 05:18:40.280 align:start position:0%
purpose of a statute of limitations is
 
05:18:43.270 --> 05:18:43.280 align:start position:0%
to eliminate stale or fraudulent claims
 
05:18:44.708 --> 05:18:44.718 align:start position:0%
as the court has further explained a
 
05:18:46.468 --> 05:18:46.478 align:start position:0%
statute of limitations establishes a
 
05:18:48.590 --> 05:18:48.600 align:start position:0%
deadline after which a defendant May
 
05:18:50.868 --> 05:18:50.878 align:start position:0%
legitimately have peace of mind it
 
05:18:52.590 --> 05:18:52.600 align:start position:0%
recognizes that after a certain period
 
05:18:54.510 --> 05:18:54.520 align:start position:0%
of time it is unfair to require a
 
05:18:56.350 --> 05:18:56.360 align:start position:0%
defendant to attempt to piece together
 
05:18:58.830 --> 05:18:58.840 align:start position:0%
defense to an old claim the court
 
05:19:00.868 --> 05:19:00.878 align:start position:0%
another case recognized that statutes of
 
05:19:03.430 --> 05:19:03.440 align:start position:0%
limitation serve society's purposes by
 
05:19:04.948 --> 05:19:04.958 align:start position:0%
keeping from the courts those claims
 
05:19:06.830 --> 05:19:06.840 align:start position:0%
which are stale and in which credibility
 
05:19:08.830 --> 05:19:08.840 align:start position:0%
has been eroded by the passage of time
 
05:19:11.430 --> 05:19:11.440 align:start position:0%
and faltering memories these limitation
 
05:19:13.110 --> 05:19:13.120 align:start position:0%
periods expedite the orderly
 
05:19:15.270 --> 05:19:15.280 align:start position:0%
administration of justice and promote
 
05:19:17.628 --> 05:19:17.638 align:start position:0%
security and stability to human Affairs
 
05:19:19.230 --> 05:19:19.240 align:start position:0%
again all statements by the New
 
05:19:22.670 --> 05:19:22.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court HB 1089 would
 
05:19:25.030 --> 05:19:25.040 align:start position:0%
proposes to upend those foundational
 
05:19:27.230 --> 05:19:27.240 align:start position:0%
public policies es by eliminating the
 
05:19:29.468 --> 05:19:29.478 align:start position:0%
statute of limitations for p injury
 
05:19:32.110 --> 05:19:32.120 align:start position:0%
claims the bill would allow P injury
 
05:19:34.548 --> 05:19:34.558 align:start position:0%
lawsuits to be brought for literally
 
05:19:36.750 --> 05:19:36.760 align:start position:0%
forever in doing so the bill would
 
05:19:39.030 --> 05:19:39.040 align:start position:0%
remove any semblance of predictability
 
05:19:41.788 --> 05:19:41.798 align:start position:0%
or rationality in past litigation and
 
05:19:43.628 --> 05:19:43.638 align:start position:0%
expose countless New Hampshire entities
 
05:19:45.510 --> 05:19:45.520 align:start position:0%
to potentially indefinite
 
05:19:47.628 --> 05:19:47.638 align:start position:0%
liability importantly there is no
 
05:19:49.948 --> 05:19:49.958 align:start position:0%
compelling reason to take this extreme
 
05:19:51.948 --> 05:19:51.958 align:start position:0%
approach as was mentioned at the
 
05:19:54.990 --> 05:19:55.000 align:start position:0%
beginning just a few years ago in 2021
 
05:19:57.110 --> 05:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
the legislature doubled the statute of
 
05:19:59.510 --> 05:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
limitations for p injury claims from 3
 
05:20:01.948 --> 05:20:01.958 align:start position:0%
years to 6 years the amendment also
 
05:20:04.708 --> 05:20:04.718 align:start position:0%
included an explicit Discovery rule that
 
05:20:07.750 --> 05:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
can extend that already longer statute
 
05:20:10.310 --> 05:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
of limitations period the six-year
 
05:20:12.910 --> 05:20:12.920 align:start position:0%
limitations period does not begin to run
 
05:20:15.270 --> 05:20:15.280 align:start position:0%
until the plaintiff discovers or in the
 
05:20:18.110 --> 05:20:18.120 align:start position:0%
exercise of reasonable diligence should
 
05:20:21.190 --> 05:20:21.200 align:start position:0%
have discovered both the injury and the
 
05:20:23.430 --> 05:20:23.440 align:start position:0%
causal relationship to a defendant's
 
05:20:26.948 --> 05:20:26.958 align:start position:0%
torous act or omission in other words a
 
05:20:30.548 --> 05:20:30.558 align:start position:0%
person can already Sue 10 20 30 years
 
05:20:32.628 --> 05:20:32.638 align:start position:0%
after being injured if for whatever
 
05:20:34.590 --> 05:20:34.600 align:start position:0%
reason they didn't discover the injury
 
05:20:36.590 --> 05:20:36.600 align:start position:0%
and who caused it and they were
 
05:20:38.948 --> 05:20:38.958 align:start position:0%
reasonably diligent in trying and didn't
 
05:20:40.910 --> 05:20:40.920 align:start position:0%
just sleep on their injury
 
05:20:43.628 --> 05:20:43.638 align:start position:0%
claim to put this bill in a national
 
05:20:46.788 --> 05:20:46.798 align:start position:0%
context no state has ever taken this
 
05:20:49.350 --> 05:20:49.360 align:start position:0%
approach to P or any other potentially
 
05:20:51.910 --> 05:20:51.920 align:start position:0%
harmful substance as far as I can tell
 
05:20:54.948 --> 05:20:54.958 align:start position:0%
the there is only one situation in which
 
05:20:57.350 --> 05:20:57.360 align:start position:0%
a state has eliminated a civil statute
 
05:20:59.510 --> 05:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
of limitations period and that is in the
 
05:21:02.510 --> 05:21:02.520 align:start position:0%
very different very unique context of
 
05:21:05.310 --> 05:21:05.320 align:start position:0%
childhood sexual abuse claims the
 
05:21:07.750 --> 05:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
rationale for doing so in that situation
 
05:21:09.670 --> 05:21:09.680 align:start position:0%
is that sexually abused children might
 
05:21:11.948 --> 05:21:11.958 align:start position:0%
repress their trauma and injury so A
 
05:21:13.788 --> 05:21:13.798 align:start position:0%
specialized rule is needed to address
 
05:21:15.390 --> 05:21:15.400 align:start position:0%
those exceptional
 
05:21:17.830 --> 05:21:17.840 align:start position:0%
circumstances even so only around a
 
05:21:20.150 --> 05:21:20.160 align:start position:0%
dozen states or so have taken the
 
05:21:22.548 --> 05:21:22.558 align:start position:0%
approach of eliminating the applicable
 
05:21:24.750 --> 05:21:24.760 align:start position:0%
statute of limitations as opposed to
 
05:21:27.110 --> 05:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
extending it or creating a specialized
 
05:21:30.070 --> 05:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
Discovery rule for it I would submit
 
05:21:33.070 --> 05:21:33.080 align:start position:0%
that a p related injury uh Bears no
 
05:21:34.990 --> 05:21:35.000 align:start position:0%
similarity to repress childhood sexual
 
05:21:37.070 --> 05:21:37.080 align:start position:0%
abuse uh and instead fits within the
 
05:21:39.510 --> 05:21:39.520 align:start position:0%
universe of other tort claims for which
 
05:21:43.110 --> 05:21:43.120 align:start position:0%
finite statutes of limitations govern it
 
05:21:44.788 --> 05:21:44.798 align:start position:0%
is also worth noting that from a
 
05:21:47.190 --> 05:21:47.200 align:start position:0%
national perspective 6 years is among
 
05:21:49.150 --> 05:21:49.160 align:start position:0%
the longest limitations periods for
 
05:21:51.430 --> 05:21:51.440 align:start position:0%
bringing a tort claim in many states
 
05:21:54.548 --> 05:21:54.558 align:start position:0%
that limitations period is 2 years or 3
 
05:21:58.030 --> 05:21:58.040 align:start position:0%
years finally eliminating the six-year
 
05:22:00.070 --> 05:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
statute of limitations for pasas injury
 
05:22:02.030 --> 05:22:02.040 align:start position:0%
claims would be especially unjust in the
 
05:22:04.670 --> 05:22:04.680 align:start position:0%
context of exposure to pasas as as was
 
05:22:07.190 --> 05:22:07.200 align:start position:0%
stated uh by the by the students uh in
 
05:22:11.390 --> 05:22:11.400 align:start position:0%
terms of how ubiquitous p is p refers to
 
05:22:14.270 --> 05:22:14.280 align:start position:0%
a class of nearly 15,000 chemicals and
 
05:22:16.510 --> 05:22:16.520 align:start position:0%
virtually everyone is exposed regularly
 
05:22:19.390 --> 05:22:19.400 align:start position:0%
to P for instance as a recent Time
 
05:22:21.708 --> 05:22:21.718 align:start position:0%
magazine article pointed out every
 
05:22:25.030 --> 05:22:25.040 align:start position:0%
raindrop has pasas in it approximately
 
05:22:29.110 --> 05:22:29.120 align:start position:0%
90 7 to 99% of Americans have some level
 
05:22:32.270 --> 05:22:32.280 align:start position:0%
of past in their bodies right now that
 
05:22:34.310 --> 05:22:34.320 align:start position:0%
this means that pretty much everyone is
 
05:22:36.110 --> 05:22:36.120 align:start position:0%
a potential plaintiff and could bring a
 
05:22:39.110 --> 05:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
lawsuit against someone at some point if
 
05:22:41.750 --> 05:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
that person ever experiences any ailment
 
05:22:44.468 --> 05:22:44.478 align:start position:0%
allegedly caused by pasas as a practical
 
05:22:46.190 --> 05:22:46.200 align:start position:0%
matter it would be virtually impossible
 
05:22:47.948 --> 05:22:47.958 align:start position:0%
for any defendant whether a large
 
05:22:50.708 --> 05:22:50.718 align:start position:0%
corporation a small business even a
 
05:22:53.070 --> 05:22:53.080 align:start position:0%
neighbor to mount a fair defense to
 
05:22:55.548 --> 05:22:55.558 align:start position:0%
claims alleging injury that occurred 40
 
05:22:58.868 --> 05:22:58.878 align:start position:0%
50 60 years prior this is why the
 
05:23:01.270 --> 05:23:01.280 align:start position:0%
existence of statutes of limitations are
 
05:23:03.510 --> 05:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
so vital to maintain a balance and
 
05:23:05.868 --> 05:23:05.878 align:start position:0%
predictability and avoid chaos in New
 
05:23:08.230 --> 05:23:08.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's Civil Justice System and
 
05:23:10.510 --> 05:23:10.520 align:start position:0%
with that um for all these reasons atro
 
05:23:11.868 --> 05:23:11.878 align:start position:0%
respectfully urges the committee to
 
05:23:13.868 --> 05:23:13.878 align:start position:0%
reject this bill and I'd be pleased to
 
05:23:15.150 --> 05:23:15.160 align:start position:0%
answer any
 
05:23:17.270 --> 05:23:17.280 align:start position:0%
questions questions for this witness
 
05:23:17.280 --> 05:23:18.670 align:start position:0%
questions questions for this witness
representative

05:23:18.670 --> 05:23:18.680 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:23:20.830 --> 05:23:20.840 align:start position:0%
Perez thank you thanks for taking my
 
05:23:23.030 --> 05:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
questions are you aware that New
 
05:23:24.548 --> 05:23:24.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I know you mentioned other
 
05:23:26.190 --> 05:23:26.200 align:start position:0%
states and everything but we're New
 
05:23:28.590 --> 05:23:28.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh are you aware that New
 
05:23:30.670 --> 05:23:30.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has an
 
05:23:33.750 --> 05:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
incredible Southern New Hampshire an
 
05:23:38.670 --> 05:23:38.680 align:start position:0%
incredible water problem because of pest
 
05:23:42.070 --> 05:23:42.080 align:start position:0%
and it's a huge I happen to live in
 
05:23:45.788 --> 05:23:45.798 align:start position:0%
londonairy and we have a huge past
 
05:23:48.548 --> 05:23:48.558 align:start position:0%
problem in the water in the water
 
05:23:52.350 --> 05:23:52.360 align:start position:0%
because of a company much like Dupont
 
05:23:54.788 --> 05:23:54.798 align:start position:0%
are you aware of that and that is why
 
05:23:57.548 --> 05:23:57.558 align:start position:0%
okay and are you aware that this
 
05:23:59.590 --> 05:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
negotiations or whatever you want to
 
05:24:02.468 --> 05:24:02.478 align:start position:0%
call them with that company have been
 
05:24:05.030 --> 05:24:05.040 align:start position:0%
going on for a long time the company's
 
05:24:08.030 --> 05:24:08.040 align:start position:0%
now leaving closing down and leaving and
 
05:24:10.430 --> 05:24:10.440 align:start position:0%
been going on for a long time and that
 
05:24:13.708 --> 05:24:13.718 align:start position:0%
the wheels of this turn very very slowly
 
05:24:15.628 --> 05:24:15.638 align:start position:0%
and that's why they're looking to extend
 
05:24:18.468 --> 05:24:18.478 align:start position:0%
this I am aware of that and I will just
 
05:24:20.948 --> 05:24:20.958 align:start position:0%
say that the statute of limitations
 
05:24:22.788 --> 05:24:22.798 align:start position:0%
doesn't affect whether a claim is
 
05:24:26.030 --> 05:24:26.040 align:start position:0%
Meritus or not it affects the period in
 
05:24:28.150 --> 05:24:28.160 align:start position:0%
which a claim can be brought right and
 
05:24:31.708 --> 05:24:31.718 align:start position:0%
so when you have a dis the existing
 
05:24:34.590 --> 05:24:34.600 align:start position:0%
Discovery rule provides that the claim
 
05:24:36.590 --> 05:24:36.600 align:start position:0%
can be the the period in which to bring
 
05:24:39.750 --> 05:24:39.760 align:start position:0%
a meritorious claim can
 
05:24:42.750 --> 05:24:42.760 align:start position:0%
extend decades if if if the science
 
05:24:45.150 --> 05:24:45.160 align:start position:0%
isn't there to link to show a both
 
05:24:46.788 --> 05:24:46.798 align:start position:0%
injury you have first of all you like
 
05:24:48.430 --> 05:24:48.440 align:start position:0%
all tour claims you have to show an
 
05:24:51.110 --> 05:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
injury so people might not develop an
 
05:24:54.468 --> 05:24:54.478 align:start position:0%
injury for 10 20 30 years after you have
 
05:24:56.190 --> 05:24:56.200 align:start position:0%
an injury you have to be aware you have
 
05:24:57.990 --> 05:24:58.000 align:start position:0%
to discover the injury or reasonably
 
05:24:59.990 --> 05:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
should have discovered the injury and
 
05:25:02.430 --> 05:25:02.440 align:start position:0%
the causal connection to it so not just
 
05:25:05.430 --> 05:25:05.440 align:start position:0%
I'm injured and I now know who caused it
 
05:25:08.150 --> 05:25:08.160 align:start position:0%
that is when the statute of limitations
 
05:25:10.590 --> 05:25:10.600 align:start position:0%
kicks in so to answer the questions that
 
05:25:11.670 --> 05:25:11.680 align:start position:0%
were earlier I think there was a
 
05:25:14.548 --> 05:25:14.558 align:start position:0%
question about tobacco litigation and
 
05:25:17.230 --> 05:25:17.240 align:start position:0%
asbest and all of those have statutes of
 
05:25:19.948 --> 05:25:19.958 align:start position:0%
limitation I'm at most their six years
 
05:25:22.670 --> 05:25:22.680 align:start position:0%
they probably less but the reason that
 
05:25:25.430 --> 05:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
those claims that litigation goes on for
 
05:25:28.468 --> 05:25:28.478 align:start position:0%
10 20 30 years in asbest case more than
 
05:25:31.030 --> 05:25:31.040 align:start position:0%
a half century now the reason is that
 
05:25:33.150 --> 05:25:33.160 align:start position:0%
because the injury doesn't develop for a
 
05:25:34.868 --> 05:25:34.878 align:start position:0%
very long time sometimes they latent
 
05:25:36.990 --> 05:25:37.000 align:start position:0%
injuries they take decades to develop in
 
05:25:40.350 --> 05:25:40.360 align:start position:0%
some cases and in C in other cases the
 
05:25:42.708 --> 05:25:42.718 align:start position:0%
science wasn't there to show that there
 
05:25:44.910 --> 05:25:44.920 align:start position:0%
was causation so that the injury was
 
05:25:47.830 --> 05:25:47.840 align:start position:0%
caused by past as opposed to I don't
 
05:25:51.350 --> 05:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
know I drank a vial of you know toxic
 
05:25:54.990 --> 05:25:55.000 align:start position:0%
waste I mean so uh you have to establish
 
05:25:58.070 --> 05:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
both and the current New Hampshire law
 
05:26:00.430 --> 05:26:00.440 align:start position:0%
allows for that and so that would it
 
05:26:02.510 --> 05:26:02.520 align:start position:0%
tolls the limitation period and
 
05:26:04.548 --> 05:26:04.558 align:start position:0%
potentially toll it for a very long time
 
05:26:06.750 --> 05:26:06.760 align:start position:0%
what this bill does again is just throws
 
05:26:09.310 --> 05:26:09.320 align:start position:0%
that out the window which again no state
 
05:26:12.948 --> 05:26:12.958 align:start position:0%
has ever done in the context of P or uh
 
05:26:14.390 --> 05:26:14.400 align:start position:0%
any other potentially hazardous
 
05:26:16.310 --> 05:26:16.320 align:start position:0%
substance and there are certainly a lot
 
05:26:18.030 --> 05:26:18.040 align:start position:0%
more hazardous substances than pasas
 
05:26:20.430 --> 05:26:20.440 align:start position:0%
that exist in the world uh toxic waste
 
05:26:23.750 --> 05:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
was thrown out as an example earlier but
 
05:26:26.430 --> 05:26:26.440 align:start position:0%
um there's a reason that states don't do
 
05:26:29.110 --> 05:26:29.120 align:start position:0%
this it's it's because it fundamentally
 
05:26:31.430 --> 05:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
disrupts the Civil Justice System in the
 
05:26:33.628 --> 05:26:33.638 align:start position:0%
state or would if they if if they went
 
05:26:34.990 --> 05:26:35.000 align:start position:0%
down that
 
05:26:38.990 --> 05:26:39.000 align:start position:0%
path Mr representative dorenzo thank you
 
05:26:40.310 --> 05:26:40.320 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
05:26:42.070 --> 05:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
question um would you please send the
 
05:26:43.788 --> 05:26:43.798 align:start position:0%
committee a copy of your
 
05:26:48.310 --> 05:26:48.320 align:start position:0%
testimony um my oral remarks uh
 
05:26:51.548 --> 05:26:51.558 align:start position:0%
sure thank you right representative
 
05:26:54.030 --> 05:26:54.040 align:start position:0%
Smith um thank you first of all you know
 
05:26:55.628 --> 05:26:55.638 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is not
 
05:26:57.788 --> 05:26:57.798 align:start position:0%
made uncomfortable by the thought that
 
05:26:59.670 --> 05:26:59.680 align:start position:0%
we might be first in the nation in
 
05:27:03.788 --> 05:27:03.798 align:start position:0%
anything so um I just want to if if
 
05:27:05.350 --> 05:27:05.360 align:start position:0%
you're going to make the trip up from
 
05:27:07.030 --> 05:27:07.040 align:start position:0%
Washington again in the future you might
 
05:27:10.270 --> 05:27:10.280 align:start position:0%
want to skip that line and testimony um
 
05:27:12.230 --> 05:27:12.240 align:start position:0%
but I want to ask you something about
 
05:27:14.310 --> 05:27:14.320 align:start position:0%
the fact that you're making this trip up
 
05:27:18.430 --> 05:27:18.440 align:start position:0%
from Washington um it fascinates me
 
05:27:21.910 --> 05:27:21.920 align:start position:0%
we're a small state um 1.3 million
 
05:27:23.548 --> 05:27:23.558 align:start position:0%
people of course there are those of us
 
05:27:25.750 --> 05:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
who love it Daniel Webster loves the
 
05:27:30.310 --> 05:27:30.320 align:start position:0%
state uh the fact that you're
 
05:27:34.948 --> 05:27:34.958 align:start position:0%
here kind of confuses me is there not a
 
05:27:38.390 --> 05:27:38.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Law Firm that would have
 
05:27:41.110 --> 05:27:41.120 align:start position:0%
had the information The
 
05:27:45.310 --> 05:27:45.320 align:start position:0%
credibility to represent at least some
 
05:27:46.948 --> 05:27:46.958 align:start position:0%
of the
 
05:27:50.910 --> 05:27:50.920 align:start position:0%
entities you you um are here on behalf
 
05:27:53.430 --> 05:27:53.440 align:start position:0%
of I
 
05:27:57.468 --> 05:27:57.478 align:start position:0%
guess to me it's an alarm signal that
 
05:28:01.548 --> 05:28:01.558 align:start position:0%
you are here and um and that makes me
 
05:28:03.590 --> 05:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
think that maybe this bills on the right
 
05:28:06.310 --> 05:28:06.320 align:start position:0%
track and that might be unfair and
 
05:28:08.070 --> 05:28:08.080 align:start position:0%
that's why I want to share my feelings
 
05:28:10.150 --> 05:28:10.160 align:start position:0%
with you I I understand and maybe I can
 
05:28:12.030 --> 05:28:12.040 align:start position:0%
put you at ease a little bit I was
 
05:28:13.590 --> 05:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
actually here testifying on a bill
 
05:28:17.070 --> 05:28:17.080 align:start position:0%
yesterday and I just was asked oh so
 
05:28:20.310 --> 05:28:20.320 align:start position:0%
it's a twofer in a sense yes like I I I
 
05:28:22.110 --> 05:28:22.120 align:start position:0%
I'm not here I wasn't here specifically
 
05:28:24.030 --> 05:28:24.040 align:start position:0%
for this bill if it makes you feel
 
05:28:26.670 --> 05:28:26.680 align:start position:0%
better right representative Wallace have
 
05:28:28.350 --> 05:28:28.360 align:start position:0%
a question yes thank you thank you for
 
05:28:29.628 --> 05:28:29.638 align:start position:0%
taking my question you're up here from
 
05:28:32.628 --> 05:28:32.638 align:start position:0%
DC could you speak to uh any federal
 
05:28:35.948 --> 05:28:35.958 align:start position:0%
regulations and I'm thinking of EPA type
 
05:28:38.390 --> 05:28:38.400 align:start position:0%
uh situations I'm sure we've all
 
05:28:40.708 --> 05:28:40.718 align:start position:0%
remember the Love Canal in Upstate New
 
05:28:42.948 --> 05:28:42.958 align:start position:0%
York back in the 60s and 70s the river
 
05:28:45.350 --> 05:28:45.360 align:start position:0%
actually being on fire from Hazmat we've
 
05:28:48.150 --> 05:28:48.160 align:start position:0%
had some local um occurrences here in
 
05:28:50.230 --> 05:28:50.240 align:start position:0%
the State uh the Tanner and Raymond uh
 
05:28:52.468 --> 05:28:52.478 align:start position:0%
BD oil waste oil distribution these are
 
05:28:54.628 --> 05:28:54.638 align:start position:0%
all super fund sites that are still
 
05:28:58.190 --> 05:28:58.200 align:start position:0%
being remed remediated 40 years later I
 
05:29:01.230 --> 05:29:01.240 align:start position:0%
remember as a young man um and these uh
 
05:29:05.350 --> 05:29:05.360 align:start position:0%
the BD in particular that lawsuit went
 
05:29:07.310 --> 05:29:07.320 align:start position:0%
multigenerational in that I believe the
 
05:29:09.510 --> 05:29:09.520 align:start position:0%
feds prosecuted this but not only did
 
05:29:12.628 --> 05:29:12.638 align:start position:0%
they um sue the uh the operation got
 
05:29:15.868 --> 05:29:15.878 align:start position:0%
shut down and also the the kids uh their
 
05:29:18.390 --> 05:29:18.400 align:start position:0%
fortunes were brought into this so my
 
05:29:21.390 --> 05:29:21.400 align:start position:0%
question is don't we already have almost
 
05:29:23.350 --> 05:29:23.360 align:start position:0%
no statute limitations for environmental
 
05:29:25.230 --> 05:29:25.240 align:start position:0%
crimes I mean this would be anal to an
 
05:29:26.750 --> 05:29:26.760 align:start position:0%
environmental crime I understand it's a
 
05:29:30.628 --> 05:29:30.638 align:start position:0%
civil no I mean um I'm not extremely
 
05:29:32.788 --> 05:29:32.798 align:start position:0%
well versed in how super fund works but
 
05:29:36.990 --> 05:29:37.000 align:start position:0%
I believe there is I mean there are
 
05:29:39.390 --> 05:29:39.400 align:start position:0%
statutes of limitation they just in in
 
05:29:42.788 --> 05:29:42.798 align:start position:0%
super fund cases a lot of times they a
 
05:29:45.190 --> 05:29:45.200 align:start position:0%
remediation effort can be to your point
 
05:29:47.708 --> 05:29:47.718 align:start position:0%
a multi-decade process just because it
 
05:29:49.708 --> 05:29:49.718 align:start position:0%
it's very difficult in some situations
 
05:29:51.310 --> 05:29:51.320 align:start position:0%
depending on the type of uh
 
05:29:53.670 --> 05:29:53.680 align:start position:0%
environmental contamination to just snap
 
05:29:55.750 --> 05:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
your fingers and and get it clean it it
 
05:29:59.110 --> 05:29:59.120 align:start position:0%
can it can be so it's not so much that
 
05:30:02.468 --> 05:30:02.478 align:start position:0%
and superf fund we're talking here about
 
05:30:05.070 --> 05:30:05.080 align:start position:0%
private personal injury claims as
 
05:30:08.750 --> 05:30:08.760 align:start position:0%
opposed to a what might be a class
 
05:30:11.708 --> 05:30:11.718 align:start position:0%
remediation effort or a fund site of
 
05:30:13.868 --> 05:30:13.878 align:start position:0%
remediation effort which is very a
 
05:30:13.878 --> 05:30:14.910 align:start position:0%
remediation effort which is very a
different

05:30:14.910 --> 05:30:14.920 align:start position:0%
different
 
05:30:18.548 --> 05:30:18.558 align:start position:0%
animal follow yes please yes thank you
 
05:30:21.430 --> 05:30:21.440 align:start position:0%
um I understand that this is to address
 
05:30:24.670 --> 05:30:24.680 align:start position:0%
individual causes of action but we're
 
05:30:27.070 --> 05:30:27.080 align:start position:0%
not not there's a there's thousands of
 
05:30:28.270 --> 05:30:28.280 align:start position:0%
individuals that have been affected here
 
05:30:30.110 --> 05:30:30.120 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire from this St gobain
 
05:30:33.230 --> 05:30:33.240 align:start position:0%
site in Northern marac New Hampshire um
 
05:30:35.510 --> 05:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
I've had personal properties Wells uh be
 
05:30:37.230 --> 05:30:37.240 align:start position:0%
inspected by this and it's it's
 
05:30:40.788 --> 05:30:40.798 align:start position:0%
absolutely contaminated so this may
 
05:30:42.990 --> 05:30:43.000 align:start position:0%
develop into more of a class action suit
 
05:30:46.948 --> 05:30:46.958 align:start position:0%
but uh clearly um the deed has been done
 
05:30:49.070 --> 05:30:49.080 align:start position:0%
the harm has been done and we do have
 
05:30:52.310 --> 05:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
victims uh here in New Hampshire and uh
 
05:30:54.150 --> 05:30:54.160 align:start position:0%
you know the piper needs to pay is due
 
05:30:55.948 --> 05:30:55.958 align:start position:0%
and leaving the State doesn't solve the
 
05:30:57.948 --> 05:30:57.958 align:start position:0%
problem you know that's that's part of
 
05:31:00.750 --> 05:31:00.760 align:start position:0%
our concern so if you're going to
 
05:31:03.230 --> 05:31:03.240 align:start position:0%
operate in an above board Manner and be
 
05:31:05.230 --> 05:31:05.240 align:start position:0%
responsible that's not what's happening
 
05:31:06.830 --> 05:31:06.840 align:start position:0%
here these people are leaving the state
 
05:31:08.430 --> 05:31:08.440 align:start position:0%
and leaving our jurisdiction so it
 
05:31:09.830 --> 05:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
leaves us no choice they're not doing
 
05:31:11.350 --> 05:31:11.360 align:start position:0%
the right thing we're going to change
 
05:31:12.708 --> 05:31:12.718 align:start position:0%
the Rules of Engagement and we're going
 
05:31:15.750 --> 05:31:15.760 align:start position:0%
to lock horns with them however long it
 
05:31:18.708 --> 05:31:18.718 align:start position:0%
takes uh well Ju Just to recap so this
 
05:31:21.030 --> 05:31:21.040 align:start position:0%
bill affects far more than with just
 
05:31:23.230 --> 05:31:23.240 align:start position:0%
more one company this bill would affect
 
05:31:25.788 --> 05:31:25.798 align:start position:0%
countless entities it could affect
 
05:31:27.830 --> 05:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
someone I mean it could affect down to
 
05:31:29.708 --> 05:31:29.718 align:start position:0%
the personal level not small business
 
05:31:31.750 --> 05:31:31.760 align:start position:0%
large business correct up and down the
 
05:31:36.468 --> 05:31:36.478 align:start position:0%
line so um you know I I I would urge
 
05:31:40.468 --> 05:31:40.478 align:start position:0%
that it's not
 
05:31:44.468 --> 05:31:44.478 align:start position:0%
um taking this path the this type of
 
05:31:47.270 --> 05:31:47.280 align:start position:0%
path in in this legislation would not be
 
05:31:51.110 --> 05:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
uh a sound way if you're just if your
 
05:31:54.548 --> 05:31:54.558 align:start position:0%
beef is with uh a particular entity or
 
05:31:57.030 --> 05:31:57.040 align:start position:0%
uh because because again this affects
 
05:32:01.788 --> 05:32:01.798 align:start position:0%
everyone agreed and as a as a 30-year
 
05:32:04.868 --> 05:32:04.878 align:start position:0%
license small Hazmat generator by the
 
05:32:08.030 --> 05:32:08.040 align:start position:0%
EPA who's never had any incidents um we
 
05:32:09.670 --> 05:32:09.680 align:start position:0%
take a lot of time and effort to make
 
05:32:11.150 --> 05:32:11.160 align:start position:0%
sure that we don't have any releases
 
05:32:13.270 --> 05:32:13.280 align:start position:0%
into the environment um and even in the
 
05:32:14.948 --> 05:32:14.958 align:start position:0%
small auto repair shop like I own and
 
05:32:17.388 --> 05:32:17.398 align:start position:0%
operated for 30 plus years we took it
 
05:32:19.548 --> 05:32:19.558 align:start position:0%
very seriously and I am a mom was a mom
 
05:32:21.990 --> 05:32:22.000 align:start position:0%
and pop operation these are clearly
 
05:32:23.990 --> 05:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
large organizations that have the
 
05:32:26.230 --> 05:32:26.240 align:start position:0%
science the the research uh wings and
 
05:32:27.590 --> 05:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
their organizations they know what they
 
05:32:30.030 --> 05:32:30.040 align:start position:0%
were doing that's why they located here
 
05:32:32.110 --> 05:32:32.120 align:start position:0%
back in the day
 
05:32:34.628 --> 05:32:34.638 align:start position:0%
um I appreciate the answer but I think
 
05:32:36.430 --> 05:32:36.440 align:start position:0%
uh there was some nefarious acts going
 
05:32:38.150 --> 05:32:38.160 align:start position:0%
on here and we we need to get to the
 
05:32:40.510 --> 05:32:40.520 align:start position:0%
bottom of it and people need to right
 
05:32:43.948 --> 05:32:43.958 align:start position:0%
just again this doesn't affect the Merit
 
05:32:46.868 --> 05:32:46.878 align:start position:0%
the meritorious of any individual claim
 
05:32:49.150 --> 05:32:49.160 align:start position:0%
this is merely the period in which you
 
05:32:51.430 --> 05:32:51.440 align:start position:0%
can bring a claim and how that how that
 
05:32:52.910 --> 05:32:52.920 align:start position:0%
is uh
 
05:32:56.190 --> 05:32:56.200 align:start position:0%
determined other question for this
 
05:32:59.910 --> 05:32:59.920 align:start position:0%
witness yes representative CH yeah than
 
05:33:02.270 --> 05:33:02.280 align:start position:0%
thanks and thank you for taking the
 
05:33:04.548 --> 05:33:04.558 align:start position:0%
question um I just following up on some
 
05:33:06.510 --> 05:33:06.520 align:start position:0%
uh line of of discussion that you
 
05:33:07.990 --> 05:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
brought up earlier which seemed to sort
 
05:33:08.000 --> 05:33:08.628 align:start position:0%
brought up earlier which seemed to sort
of

05:33:08.628 --> 05:33:08.638 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:33:12.910 --> 05:33:12.920 align:start position:0%
say PS is a very large class of
 
05:33:17.070 --> 05:33:17.080 align:start position:0%
chemicals um that's broadly exposed
 
05:33:21.430 --> 05:33:21.440 align:start position:0%
everyone over over long periods of time
 
05:33:23.548 --> 05:33:23.558 align:start position:0%
um and
 
05:33:23.558 --> 05:33:25.990 align:start position:0%
um and
uh

05:33:25.990 --> 05:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:33:28.750 --> 05:33:28.760 align:start position:0%
and that the the sort of ability to
 
05:33:32.830 --> 05:33:32.840 align:start position:0%
connect um the exposure to any given you
 
05:33:32.840 --> 05:33:33.868 align:start position:0%
connect um the exposure to any given you
know

05:33:33.868 --> 05:33:33.878 align:start position:0%
know
 
05:33:36.430 --> 05:33:36.440 align:start position:0%
outcome uh because of that because there
 
05:33:37.990 --> 05:33:38.000 align:start position:0%
are so many chemicals and they're so
 
05:33:40.150 --> 05:33:40.160 align:start position:0%
ubiquitous and they last forever as
 
05:33:43.548 --> 05:33:43.558 align:start position:0%
third point I was trying to bring up um
 
05:33:46.350 --> 05:33:46.360 align:start position:0%
I was not clear of why that was brought
 
05:33:49.910 --> 05:33:49.920 align:start position:0%
up it almost in my mind seems to speak
 
05:33:52.590 --> 05:33:52.600 align:start position:0%
to why this class of chemicals would
 
05:33:55.350 --> 05:33:55.360 align:start position:0%
have a longer or maybe no statute of
 
05:33:59.150 --> 05:33:59.160 align:start position:0%
limitations because it will take so long
 
05:34:05.230 --> 05:34:05.240 align:start position:0%
to establish the impact in other words
 
05:34:08.030 --> 05:34:08.040 align:start position:0%
if everyone has these how how how how
 
05:34:09.830 --> 05:34:09.840 align:start position:0%
much exposure and how long does it have
 
05:34:12.670 --> 05:34:12.680 align:start position:0%
to happen before you begin to be able to
 
05:34:14.830 --> 05:34:14.840 align:start position:0%
make the case that this
 
05:34:17.670 --> 05:34:17.680 align:start position:0%
particular um contamination led to this
 
05:34:20.628 --> 05:34:20.638 align:start position:0%
particular outcome and then basically
 
05:34:22.590 --> 05:34:22.600 align:start position:0%
have to move forward from that yeah so
 
05:34:25.070 --> 05:34:25.080 align:start position:0%
that that's a great question so because
 
05:34:27.868 --> 05:34:27.878 align:start position:0%
there is so much P if statutes of
 
05:34:29.548 --> 05:34:29.558 align:start position:0%
limitation exists to provide a balance
 
05:34:31.430 --> 05:34:31.440 align:start position:0%
in our Civil Justice System fund at a
 
05:34:32.868 --> 05:34:32.878 align:start position:0%
fundamental level that's why they exist
 
05:34:35.708 --> 05:34:35.718 align:start position:0%
in every claim so on one side you want
 
05:34:37.430 --> 05:34:37.440 align:start position:0%
to balance the plaintiff's ability to
 
05:34:39.110 --> 05:34:39.120 align:start position:0%
bring a claim within a reasonable time
 
05:34:40.708 --> 05:34:40.718 align:start position:0%
of suffering an injury and knowing who
 
05:34:42.948 --> 05:34:42.958 align:start position:0%
caused it and on the other hand you you
 
05:34:44.990 --> 05:34:45.000 align:start position:0%
want to protect defendants you want to
 
05:34:47.868 --> 05:34:47.878 align:start position:0%
sec give them a fair shake so that
 
05:34:50.030 --> 05:34:50.040 align:start position:0%
they're not having to defend claims 60
 
05:34:52.190 --> 05:34:52.200 align:start position:0%
years down the road when there's it's
 
05:34:53.948 --> 05:34:53.958 align:start position:0%
really just all the there's no records
 
05:34:56.230 --> 05:34:56.240 align:start position:0%
everyone who's involved dead and you
 
05:34:58.230 --> 05:34:58.240 align:start position:0%
just have basically one person saying
 
05:35:00.310 --> 05:35:00.320 align:start position:0%
yeah you injured me 40 years ago when I
 
05:35:03.628 --> 05:35:03.638 align:start position:0%
drank from your well um you know I I
 
05:35:04.990 --> 05:35:05.000 align:start position:0%
suffered an injury and I want to bring a
 
05:35:08.030 --> 05:35:08.040 align:start position:0%
lawsuit against you well realistically i
 
05:35:10.030 --> 05:35:10.040 align:start position:0%
i i that doesn't provide someone with
 
05:35:12.150 --> 05:35:12.160 align:start position:0%
the ability to mount a fair defense
 
05:35:14.468 --> 05:35:14.478 align:start position:0%
which is fundamental to our legal system
 
05:35:17.788 --> 05:35:17.798 align:start position:0%
so just one quick follow sure so so it
 
05:35:19.190 --> 05:35:19.200 align:start position:0%
sort of sound and this is what I'm
 
05:35:20.430 --> 05:35:20.440 align:start position:0%
struggling with it sounds like what
 
05:35:22.990 --> 05:35:23.000 align:start position:0%
you're saying is the the problem is so
 
05:35:25.830 --> 05:35:25.840 align:start position:0%
big and so ubiquitous and so diverse
 
05:35:29.388 --> 05:35:29.398 align:start position:0%
that it almost defies the concept of
 
05:35:32.030 --> 05:35:32.040 align:start position:0%
civil liability to begin with no not
 
05:35:33.948 --> 05:35:33.958 align:start position:0%
necessarily no because if you can if you
 
05:35:36.788 --> 05:35:36.798 align:start position:0%
have S if you sustained an injury from
 
05:35:38.750 --> 05:35:38.760 align:start position:0%
exposure to P fast for a long period of
 
05:35:40.030 --> 05:35:40.040 align:start position:0%
time and you can point to someone and
 
05:35:41.788 --> 05:35:41.798 align:start position:0%
say you're the one who did that you
 
05:35:44.230 --> 05:35:44.240 align:start position:0%
caused my injury you can sue them like
 
05:35:46.110 --> 05:35:46.120 align:start position:0%
there's there's no I mean you have under
 
05:35:48.190 --> 05:35:48.200 align:start position:0%
you have six years under current law to
 
05:35:50.910 --> 05:35:50.920 align:start position:0%
sue them or you have potentially decades
 
05:35:53.628 --> 05:35:53.638 align:start position:0%
to sue them if that's when your M after
 
05:35:55.548 --> 05:35:55.558 align:start position:0%
your injury materializes and you
 
05:35:58.030 --> 05:35:58.040 align:start position:0%
exercise reasonable diligence in not
 
05:36:00.070 --> 05:36:00.080 align:start position:0%
sleeping on your injury claim the the
 
05:36:01.388 --> 05:36:01.398 align:start position:0%
the basic point of a statute of
 
05:36:03.910 --> 05:36:03.920 align:start position:0%
limitations is to protect people who
 
05:36:07.110 --> 05:36:07.120 align:start position:0%
just purposefully sleep on their claim
 
05:36:08.910 --> 05:36:08.920 align:start position:0%
knowing that it gives them an unfair
 
05:36:12.110 --> 05:36:12.120 align:start position:0%
Advantage later on if you if you sleep
 
05:36:14.548 --> 05:36:14.558 align:start position:0%
if you know that if I wait a little bit
 
05:36:17.110 --> 05:36:17.120 align:start position:0%
longer there's the ability to defend
 
05:36:19.270 --> 05:36:19.280 align:start position:0%
these claims dissipates because everyone
 
05:36:22.070 --> 05:36:22.080 align:start position:0%
who can uh mount a fair defense can no
 
05:36:25.110 --> 05:36:25.120 align:start position:0%
longer do so there's a
 
05:36:26.510 --> 05:36:26.520 align:start position:0%
again backing up to what the New
 
05:36:28.510 --> 05:36:28.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court has repeatedly
 
05:36:31.270 --> 05:36:31.280 align:start position:0%
said the statutes of limitation the main
 
05:36:32.910 --> 05:36:32.920 align:start position:0%
purpose is to prevent stale and
 
05:36:32.920 --> 05:36:34.990 align:start position:0%
purpose is to prevent stale and
fraudulent

05:36:34.990 --> 05:36:35.000 align:start position:0%
fraudulent
 
05:36:38.590 --> 05:36:38.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:40.750 --> 05:36:40.760 align:start position:0%
kab thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
05:36:43.350 --> 05:36:43.360 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I want to en uh
 
05:36:44.750 --> 05:36:44.760 align:start position:0%
make sure that I understood you
 
05:36:46.270 --> 05:36:46.280 align:start position:0%
correctly because I it seems like
 
05:36:47.708 --> 05:36:47.718 align:start position:0%
there's a little bit of perhaps
 
05:36:49.070 --> 05:36:49.080 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding from other committee
 
05:36:51.548 --> 05:36:51.558 align:start position:0%
members so I just want to clarify what I
 
05:36:54.708 --> 05:36:54.718 align:start position:0%
heard you say was that let's say
 
05:36:57.150 --> 05:36:57.160 align:start position:0%
somebody is exposed to past now they
 
05:36:58.590 --> 05:36:58.600 align:start position:0%
don't know that they're currently
 
05:37:00.948 --> 05:37:00.958 align:start position:0%
injured and 20 years from now is when
 
05:37:02.430 --> 05:37:02.440 align:start position:0%
they first discovered that they were
 
05:37:04.510 --> 05:37:04.520 align:start position:0%
injured from that when they discover
 
05:37:06.788 --> 05:37:06.798 align:start position:0%
that in 20 years they have six years
 
05:37:08.708 --> 05:37:08.718 align:start position:0%
from that date of discovery is that
 
05:37:10.948 --> 05:37:10.958 align:start position:0%
correct yes and potentially even longer
 
05:37:13.868 --> 05:37:13.878 align:start position:0%
than that they because it it's not just
 
05:37:16.110 --> 05:37:16.120 align:start position:0%
that they developed an injury it's who
 
05:37:18.990 --> 05:37:19.000 align:start position:0%
caused that injury so if it they develop
 
05:37:22.230 --> 05:37:22.240 align:start position:0%
an injury in 20 years and they don't
 
05:37:25.070 --> 05:37:25.080 align:start position:0%
realize who caused it for another
 
05:37:27.468 --> 05:37:27.478 align:start position:0%
then the statute of limitations kicks in
 
05:37:31.310 --> 05:37:31.320 align:start position:0%
under the discovery rule thank you other
 
05:37:32.788 --> 05:37:32.798 align:start position:0%
questions for the yes representative for
 
05:37:34.670 --> 05:37:34.680 align:start position:0%
us thank thank you thanks for taking my
 
05:37:36.468 --> 05:37:36.478 align:start position:0%
question my concern is that you're
 
05:37:37.788 --> 05:37:37.798 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
05:37:41.430 --> 05:37:41.440 align:start position:0%
individuals um my concern is being a a
 
05:37:43.830 --> 05:37:43.840 align:start position:0%
resident of londondary um we're trying
 
05:37:46.590 --> 05:37:46.600 align:start position:0%
to get St gobain to do some things like
 
05:37:48.350 --> 05:37:48.360 align:start position:0%
put a pipeline down a road so that
 
05:37:51.868 --> 05:37:51.878 align:start position:0%
people can get uh water and they're not
 
05:37:54.910 --> 05:37:54.920 align:start position:0%
depending on their their um cont
 
05:37:57.910 --> 05:37:57.920 align:start position:0%
extremely contaminated Wells extremely
 
05:38:02.270 --> 05:38:02.280 align:start position:0%
contaminated Wells um my concern and I
 
05:38:04.670 --> 05:38:04.680 align:start position:0%
don't I my concern is not so much about
 
05:38:07.070 --> 05:38:07.080 align:start position:0%
the individual but the the big picture
 
05:38:10.150 --> 05:38:10.160 align:start position:0%
for Southern New Hampshire and it seems
 
05:38:13.468 --> 05:38:13.478 align:start position:0%
to me that the statute of limitations
 
05:38:16.430 --> 05:38:16.440 align:start position:0%
with that has really started because we
 
05:38:18.990 --> 05:38:19.000 align:start position:0%
know it's a problem and so we have our
 
05:38:23.190 --> 05:38:23.200 align:start position:0%
six years as started is that correct uh
 
05:38:24.628 --> 05:38:24.638 align:start position:0%
well there when you say we know we have
 
05:38:27.830 --> 05:38:27.840 align:start position:0%
a problem that doesn't what what what is
 
05:38:30.070 --> 05:38:30.080 align:start position:0%
required under the law is the existence
 
05:38:32.070 --> 05:38:32.080 align:start position:0%
of an injury so that might you might
 
05:38:33.468 --> 05:38:33.478 align:start position:0%
know you have a problem but you might
 
05:38:35.788 --> 05:38:35.798 align:start position:0%
the injury might not be there
 
05:38:40.830 --> 05:38:40.840 align:start position:0%
yet is not having contaminated water an
 
05:38:43.670 --> 05:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
injury uh the existence of contaminated
 
05:38:46.708 --> 05:38:46.718 align:start position:0%
water is not a physical injury with when
 
05:38:48.350 --> 05:38:48.360 align:start position:0%
we're talking about Tor claims which is
 
05:38:50.350 --> 05:38:50.360 align:start position:0%
what this is personal injury claims
 
05:38:57.110 --> 05:38:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:00.070 --> 05:39:00.080 align:start position:0%
okay all right other questions for this
 
05:39:02.948 --> 05:39:02.958 align:start position:0%

to meet you um thank you all for hear me
 
05:39:51.910 --> 05:39:51.920 align:start position:0%
speak um my name is Robert tangue um
 
05:39:54.070 --> 05:39:54.080 align:start position:0%
just in reference to the gentleman's
 
05:39:55.628 --> 05:39:55.638 align:start position:0%
last uh
 
05:39:58.310 --> 05:39:58.320 align:start position:0%
testimony um he said that personal
 
05:40:03.670 --> 05:40:03.680 align:start position:0%
injury is physical it's also P statute
 
05:40:06.150 --> 05:40:06.160 align:start position:0%
emotional um and I don't know the exact
 
05:40:08.628 --> 05:40:08.638 align:start position:0%
statute but it is emotional damage too
 
05:40:11.230 --> 05:40:11.240 align:start position:0%
and so that's kind of not looked at and
 
05:40:13.030 --> 05:40:13.040 align:start position:0%
when you go around uh looking for a
 
05:40:15.868 --> 05:40:15.878 align:start position:0%
lawyer or a law firm you'll see personal
 
05:40:17.708 --> 05:40:17.718 align:start position:0%
injury lawyers and they typically only
 
05:40:20.670 --> 05:40:20.680 align:start position:0%
take the slam dunk physical you know
 
05:40:24.990 --> 05:40:25.000 align:start position:0%
police abuse or a car accidents physical
 
05:40:28.030 --> 05:40:28.040 align:start position:0%
but it is per statute emotional abuse is
 
05:40:30.230 --> 05:40:30.240 align:start position:0%
intentional emotional uh intentional
 
05:40:32.070 --> 05:40:32.080 align:start position:0%
infliction of emotional abuse and there
 
05:40:34.230 --> 05:40:34.240 align:start position:0%
is also
 
05:40:37.948 --> 05:40:37.958 align:start position:0%
um uh negligent infliction of emotional
 
05:40:40.708 --> 05:40:40.718 align:start position:0%
abuse um as regards to the bill I don't
 
05:40:43.110 --> 05:40:43.120 align:start position:0%
know too much about the bill but I
 
05:40:45.670 --> 05:40:45.680 align:start position:0%
understand that there are some timelines
 
05:40:48.388 --> 05:40:48.398 align:start position:0%
that should be met uh for the defense
 
05:40:51.270 --> 05:40:51.280 align:start position:0%
but then there's also statutes uh which
 
05:40:55.230 --> 05:40:55.240 align:start position:0%
allow upon discovery
 
05:40:59.910 --> 05:40:59.920 align:start position:0%
of uh elements of the tort physical or
 
05:41:02.150 --> 05:41:02.160 align:start position:0%
emotional um that can extend those
 
05:41:03.750 --> 05:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
threeyear statute of
 
05:41:05.948 --> 05:41:05.958 align:start position:0%
limitations and uh that's my testimony
 
05:41:07.590 --> 05:41:07.600 align:start position:0%
on this unless there's any questions
 
05:41:09.430 --> 05:41:09.440 align:start position:0%
great questions for this
 
05:41:11.948 --> 05:41:11.958 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you very much
 
05:41:12.910 --> 05:41:12.920 align:start position:0%

05:41:17.910 --> 05:41:17.920 align:start position:0%
testify on House Bill
 
05:41:20.670 --> 05:41:20.680 align:start position:0%
1089 seeing none I'm going to close the
 
05:41:22.830 --> 05:41:22.840 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill
 
05:41:22.840 --> 05:42:36.350 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill
1089

05:42:36.350 --> 05:42:36.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:37.788 --> 05:42:37.798 align:start position:0%
okay I'm going to open up the committee
 
05:42:41.468 --> 05:42:41.478 align:start position:0%
on house bill 1104 FN and ask
 
05:42:44.670 --> 05:42:44.680 align:start position:0%
representative L Lynn to take it over
 
05:42:47.270 --> 05:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh good afternoon
 
05:42:48.628 --> 05:42:48.638 align:start position:0%
committee members I know it's been a
 
05:42:50.830 --> 05:42:50.840 align:start position:0%
long day and we're not done
 
05:42:55.070 --> 05:42:55.080 align:start position:0%
yet um uh I'm uh Representative Bob Lynn
 
05:42:57.468 --> 05:42:57.478 align:start position:0%
from wendam I'm the prime sponsor of
 
05:43:02.468 --> 05:43:02.478 align:start position:0%
this bill um and I should say that um
 
05:43:06.708 --> 05:43:06.718 align:start position:0%
this the impetus from for this bill was
 
05:43:10.110 --> 05:43:10.120 align:start position:0%
uh some discussions that I had with uh
 
05:43:12.190 --> 05:43:12.200 align:start position:0%
representative katab who is a member of
 
05:43:13.670 --> 05:43:13.680 align:start position:0%
the special
 
05:43:17.110 --> 05:43:17.120 align:start position:0%
committee uh along with representative
 
05:43:22.670 --> 05:43:22.680 align:start position:0%
Smith um on the uh uh the family family
 
05:43:26.788 --> 05:43:26.798 align:start position:0%
court um and I should say at the outset
 
05:43:29.788 --> 05:43:29.798 align:start position:0%
I I would direct your attention uh at
 
05:43:31.030 --> 05:43:31.040 align:start position:0%
the outset because I think this is
 
05:43:31.040 --> 05:43:32.430 align:start position:0%
the outset because I think this is
really

05:43:32.430 --> 05:43:32.440 align:start position:0%
really
 
05:43:37.030 --> 05:43:37.040 align:start position:0%
important to paragraph Roman numeral
 
05:43:39.788 --> 05:43:39.798 align:start position:0%
three of the bill which appears on page
 
05:43:41.388 --> 05:43:41.398 align:start position:0%
two it's really the
 
05:43:43.750 --> 05:43:43.760 align:start position:0%
last uh
 
05:43:46.510 --> 05:43:46.520 align:start position:0%
paragraph and the importance of that is
 
05:43:47.468 --> 05:43:47.478 align:start position:0%
that it
 
05:43:50.190 --> 05:43:50.200 align:start position:0%
says nothing in this section shall
 
05:43:52.670 --> 05:43:52.680 align:start position:0%
affects affect the rights of Agri
 
05:43:54.830 --> 05:43:54.840 align:start position:0%
parties or litig
 
05:43:58.430 --> 05:43:58.440 align:start position:0%
to pursue any other remedies available
 
05:43:58.440 --> 05:44:01.150 align:start position:0%
to pursue any other remedies available
by

05:44:01.150 --> 05:44:01.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:03.868 --> 05:44:03.878 align:start position:0%
law so I think I'm going to wait for
 
05:44:22.548 --> 05:44:22.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:22.558 --> 05:44:28.270 align:start position:0%
 
out

05:44:28.270 --> 05:44:28.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:30.910 --> 05:44:30.920 align:start position:0%
so anyway what uh what I the reason I
 
05:44:33.910 --> 05:44:33.920 align:start position:0%
bring to the the last paragraph of the
 
05:44:38.868 --> 05:44:38.878 align:start position:0%
bill to your attention is this um in all
 
05:44:42.910 --> 05:44:42.920 align:start position:0%
cander I don't know that this bill is
 
05:44:47.430 --> 05:44:47.440 align:start position:0%
absolutely necessary because it seems to
 
05:44:51.070 --> 05:44:51.080 align:start position:0%
me that under the existing
 
05:44:55.388 --> 05:44:55.398 align:start position:0%
law if there was a situ ation where a
 
05:44:57.948 --> 05:44:57.958 align:start position:0%
Judicial officer was found to have
 
05:45:00.230 --> 05:45:00.240 align:start position:0%
committed some
 
05:45:03.590 --> 05:45:03.600 align:start position:0%
misconduct and there was any kind of a
 
05:45:06.948 --> 05:45:06.958 align:start position:0%
credible claim that that misconduct
 
05:45:08.350 --> 05:45:08.360 align:start position:0%
could have
 
05:45:12.270 --> 05:45:12.280 align:start position:0%
affected um the the results in any
 
05:45:15.868 --> 05:45:15.878 align:start position:0%
particular case there are already
 
05:45:17.750 --> 05:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
procceed I mean for for example there's
 
05:45:20.788 --> 05:45:20.798 align:start position:0%
there's pretty well established case law
 
05:45:23.788 --> 05:45:23.798 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire that if the in a family
 
05:45:25.868 --> 05:45:25.878 align:start position:0%
law really in any case but in a family
 
05:45:29.708 --> 05:45:29.718 align:start position:0%
law case if there's been a fraud
 
05:45:32.868 --> 05:45:32.878 align:start position:0%
committed um uh in connection with the
 
05:45:36.150 --> 05:45:36.160 align:start position:0%
proceedings um that case can be reopened
 
05:45:38.910 --> 05:45:38.920 align:start position:0%
um so there's you know
 
05:45:42.110 --> 05:45:42.120 align:start position:0%
um and that's sort of the kind the kind
 
05:45:43.990 --> 05:45:44.000 align:start position:0%
of thing that we're talking about here
 
05:45:47.468 --> 05:45:47.478 align:start position:0%
so I think in those in those kinds of
 
05:45:49.948 --> 05:45:49.958 align:start position:0%
cases I'm not sure that you need this
 
05:45:54.150 --> 05:45:54.160 align:start position:0%
bill but but it seemed to me that
 
05:45:57.230 --> 05:45:57.240 align:start position:0%
that the importance of the bill and this
 
05:46:00.230 --> 05:46:00.240 align:start position:0%
is what I sort of ask you to consider is
 
05:46:04.070 --> 05:46:04.080 align:start position:0%
that to the extent
 
05:46:07.750 --> 05:46:07.760 align:start position:0%
that there needs to be a there needs to
 
05:46:09.868 --> 05:46:09.878 align:start position:0%
be a public
 
05:46:12.750 --> 05:46:12.760 align:start position:0%
perception that not just that there's
 
05:46:14.830 --> 05:46:14.840 align:start position:0%
case law in the New Hampshire Supreme
 
05:46:16.910 --> 05:46:16.920 align:start position:0%
Court or in yeah in the New Hampshire
 
05:46:18.750 --> 05:46:18.760 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court really that would allow re
 
05:46:21.468 --> 05:46:21.478 align:start position:0%
relief in these kinds of cases it would
 
05:46:23.788 --> 05:46:23.798 align:start position:0%
be better to have something in writing
 
05:46:27.230 --> 05:46:27.240 align:start position:0%
in statutes sort of confirming that and
 
05:46:29.990 --> 05:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
so that was a large part of the
 
05:46:35.430 --> 05:46:35.440 align:start position:0%
motivation uh for drafting this um and
 
05:46:37.708 --> 05:46:37.718 align:start position:0%
uh so I so
 
05:46:40.708 --> 05:46:40.718 align:start position:0%
I uh drafted this bill basically to
 
05:46:45.110 --> 05:46:45.120 align:start position:0%
create a statutory remedy that would say
 
05:46:48.510 --> 05:46:48.520 align:start position:0%
um if there's been a finding of judicial
 
05:46:51.030 --> 05:46:51.040 align:start position:0%
misconduct against primarily it's going
 
05:46:53.150 --> 05:46:53.160 align:start position:0%
to be a judge although Clerks of Court
 
05:46:57.430 --> 05:46:57.440 align:start position:0%
uh could be covered are are constitute
 
05:46:59.310 --> 05:46:59.320 align:start position:0%
judicial officers for purposes of the
 
05:47:01.230 --> 05:47:01.240 align:start position:0%
code of judicial conduct but let's
 
05:47:02.788 --> 05:47:02.798 align:start position:0%
assume we're talking about a judge if
 
05:47:05.628 --> 05:47:05.638 align:start position:0%
there's been a finding of misconduct by
 
05:47:10.510 --> 05:47:10.520 align:start position:0%
a judge then a person who alleged that
 
05:47:10.520 --> 05:47:11.670 align:start position:0%
a judge then a person who alleged that
that

05:47:11.670 --> 05:47:11.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:47:15.750 --> 05:47:15.760 align:start position:0%
misconduct had a causal relationship to
 
05:47:18.510 --> 05:47:18.520 align:start position:0%
their case and you know I I think it's
 
05:47:20.468 --> 05:47:20.478 align:start position:0%
really important to to emphasize this
 
05:47:27.388 --> 05:47:27.398 align:start position:0%
point I think it's its common sort of uh
 
05:47:30.910 --> 05:47:30.920 align:start position:0%
rhetoric for lack of a better term for
 
05:47:33.070 --> 05:47:33.080 align:start position:0%
if if if a judge has committed has
 
05:47:34.350 --> 05:47:34.360 align:start position:0%
committed some
 
05:47:36.868 --> 05:47:36.878 align:start position:0%
misconduct to assume well everything
 
05:47:39.070 --> 05:47:39.080 align:start position:0%
that that judge touched throughout his
 
05:47:41.110 --> 05:47:41.120 align:start position:0%
or her career must have been affected by
 
05:47:43.948 --> 05:47:43.958 align:start position:0%
that misconduct well Common Sense would
 
05:47:46.310 --> 05:47:46.320 align:start position:0%
would tell you that you know that's
 
05:47:51.628 --> 05:47:51.638 align:start position:0%
probably not the case um if a judge uh
 
05:47:53.750 --> 05:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
uh for example suppose a judge
 
05:47:55.990 --> 05:47:56.000 align:start position:0%
should have recused himself or herself
 
05:47:57.750 --> 05:47:57.760 align:start position:0%
on some particular case because let's
 
05:47:59.708 --> 05:47:59.718 align:start position:0%
say the there you know they had a
 
05:48:01.910 --> 05:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
personal relationship with the attorney
 
05:48:04.468 --> 05:48:04.478 align:start position:0%
in the case well certainly you might say
 
05:48:07.310 --> 05:48:07.320 align:start position:0%
it would be entirely appropriate to say
 
05:48:08.590 --> 05:48:08.600 align:start position:0%
well wait a minute you know we better go
 
05:48:10.830 --> 05:48:10.840 align:start position:0%
back and look at what rulings the judge
 
05:48:14.110 --> 05:48:14.120 align:start position:0%
made in that case
 
05:48:16.788 --> 05:48:16.798 align:start position:0%
um that's one thing that seems to me it
 
05:48:20.788 --> 05:48:20.798 align:start position:0%
could make perfect sense but to say well
 
05:48:22.590 --> 05:48:22.600 align:start position:0%
the you know five years ago the judge
 
05:48:25.110 --> 05:48:25.120 align:start position:0%
handled other case with people that had
 
05:48:26.910 --> 05:48:26.920 align:start position:0%
no relationship with there's no
 
05:48:28.868 --> 05:48:28.878 align:start position:0%
allegation that the judge had any
 
05:48:32.628 --> 05:48:32.638 align:start position:0%
relationship that that must have been uh
 
05:48:34.468 --> 05:48:34.478 align:start position:0%
there must have been some misconduct
 
05:48:36.948 --> 05:48:36.958 align:start position:0%
there too that's just what's the basis
 
05:48:41.110 --> 05:48:41.120 align:start position:0%
of that um and so that's what this is
 
05:48:43.910 --> 05:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
designed to get at is if you are
 
05:48:43.920 --> 05:48:45.468 align:start position:0%
designed to get at is if you are
claiming

05:48:45.468 --> 05:48:45.478 align:start position:0%
claiming
 
05:48:48.310 --> 05:48:48.320 align:start position:0%
that a judge who has been was found to
 
05:48:50.190 --> 05:48:50.200 align:start position:0%
have violated the code of judicial
 
05:48:54.468 --> 05:48:54.478 align:start position:0%
conduct has has or may have have done
 
05:48:56.670 --> 05:48:56.680 align:start position:0%
something that affects your case that
 
05:48:58.990 --> 05:48:59.000 align:start position:0%
that finding of misconduct has some
 
05:49:01.708 --> 05:49:01.718 align:start position:0%
implications for your case you can ask
 
05:49:04.468 --> 05:49:04.478 align:start position:0%
that the case be reviewed by the chief
 
05:49:07.230 --> 05:49:07.240 align:start position:0%
judge of the court that that judge sits
 
05:49:11.310 --> 05:49:11.320 align:start position:0%
on and the judge will make a preliminary
 
05:49:15.270 --> 05:49:15.280 align:start position:0%
determination of basically um
 
05:49:18.868 --> 05:49:18.878 align:start position:0%
uh uh is it you know is there a uh a
 
05:49:20.230 --> 05:49:20.240 align:start position:0%
reasonable likelihood that the
 
05:49:22.310 --> 05:49:22.320 align:start position:0%
misconduct of the judicial officer had a
 
05:49:25.788 --> 05:49:25.798 align:start position:0%
causal bearing ing on the challenged
 
05:49:29.110 --> 05:49:29.120 align:start position:0%
ruling uh decision or judgment in your
 
05:49:32.270 --> 05:49:32.280 align:start position:0%
case and if there's that reasonable
 
05:49:35.788 --> 05:49:35.798 align:start position:0%
likelihood then the judge will uh the
 
05:49:38.310 --> 05:49:38.320 align:start position:0%
decision will be vacated and the case
 
05:49:41.948 --> 05:49:41.958 align:start position:0%
will be remanded to a different judge uh
 
05:49:44.910 --> 05:49:44.920 align:start position:0%
for basically for a doover for lack of a
 
05:49:47.590 --> 05:49:47.600 align:start position:0%
better term uh a doover to reconsider
 
05:49:49.948 --> 05:49:49.958 align:start position:0%
the the matter
 
05:49:53.468 --> 05:49:53.478 align:start position:0%
um so that's that's kind of the upshot
 
05:49:56.350 --> 05:49:56.360 align:start position:0%
of this the one thing and I this this
 
05:49:58.948 --> 05:49:58.958 align:start position:0%
gets to be Technical and I and I but I
 
05:50:01.190 --> 05:50:01.200 align:start position:0%
think it's important because I I I
 
05:50:03.070 --> 05:50:03.080 align:start position:0%
suspect we may hear from some other
 
05:50:04.350 --> 05:50:04.360 align:start position:0%
people and I think it's kind of
 
05:50:07.430 --> 05:50:07.440 align:start position:0%
important that you um you understand
 
05:50:09.948 --> 05:50:09.958 align:start position:0%
this um you'll notice that I said that
 
05:50:12.750 --> 05:50:12.760 align:start position:0%
the decision of the chief judge in my
 
05:50:16.548 --> 05:50:16.558 align:start position:0%
example is not reviewable that decision
 
05:50:19.070 --> 05:50:19.080 align:start position:0%
is a final decision and is not
 
05:50:22.350 --> 05:50:22.360 align:start position:0%
appealable and I I know that um I had
 
05:50:23.548 --> 05:50:23.558 align:start position:0%
some discussions with with the New
 
05:50:25.230 --> 05:50:25.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Bar Association about that and
 
05:50:28.590 --> 05:50:28.600 align:start position:0%
they may have some some objections to
 
05:50:32.030 --> 05:50:32.040 align:start position:0%
that I'm not particularly married to
 
05:50:34.990 --> 05:50:35.000 align:start position:0%
that view if there's I mean I to the
 
05:50:38.190 --> 05:50:38.200 align:start position:0%
extent that there is that some people
 
05:50:40.388 --> 05:50:40.398 align:start position:0%
think that decision should be
 
05:50:43.948 --> 05:50:43.958 align:start position:0%
reviewable um you know I I I'm certainly
 
05:50:45.350 --> 05:50:45.360 align:start position:0%
open to that and leave it to the
 
05:50:47.230 --> 05:50:47.240 align:start position:0%
committee the one thing I would say and
 
05:50:50.708 --> 05:50:50.718 align:start position:0%
this this is where this gets to be uh a
 
05:50:52.750 --> 05:50:52.760 align:start position:0%
little bit of inside baseball but it it
 
05:50:55.708 --> 05:50:55.718 align:start position:0%
really has very practical
 
05:50:59.430 --> 05:50:59.440 align:start position:0%
importance if in the example the the
 
05:51:02.868 --> 05:51:02.878 align:start position:0%
chief just the chief judge of the Court
 
05:51:07.110 --> 05:51:07.120 align:start position:0%
says that the judge finds that there is
 
05:51:09.990 --> 05:51:10.000 align:start position:0%
no reasonable likelihood that the that
 
05:51:13.750 --> 05:51:13.760 align:start position:0%
the uh the the judicial misconduct had
 
05:51:16.548 --> 05:51:16.558 align:start position:0%
some bearing on your particular
 
05:51:21.910 --> 05:51:21.920 align:start position:0%
case um I I could understand changing
 
05:51:24.590 --> 05:51:24.600 align:start position:0%
the D what I've drafted to say okay that
 
05:51:29.110 --> 05:51:29.120 align:start position:0%
ruling can be appealed to the Supreme
 
05:51:32.990 --> 05:51:33.000 align:start position:0%
Court that's one thing because uh if if
 
05:51:35.468 --> 05:51:35.478 align:start position:0%
the judge says that there's no causal
 
05:51:37.868 --> 05:51:37.878 align:start position:0%
connection that's the end of that's the
 
05:51:40.150 --> 05:51:40.160 align:start position:0%
end of that complaint and so an argument
 
05:51:42.310 --> 05:51:42.320 align:start position:0%
could be made that you should be able to
 
05:51:44.990 --> 05:51:45.000 align:start position:0%
appeal that to the Supreme Court before
 
05:51:47.830 --> 05:51:47.840 align:start position:0%
your case is sort of finally thrown
 
05:51:52.030 --> 05:51:52.040 align:start position:0%
out flip the situation suppose the judge
 
05:51:52.040 --> 05:51:53.468 align:start position:0%
out flip the situation suppose the judge
says

05:51:53.468 --> 05:51:53.478 align:start position:0%
says
 
05:51:55.750 --> 05:51:55.760 align:start position:0%
yes I find that there is a reasonable
 
05:51:58.868 --> 05:51:58.878 align:start position:0%
likelihood that the misconduct had some
 
05:52:00.590 --> 05:52:00.600 align:start position:0%
may have had some bearing on your case
 
05:52:02.708 --> 05:52:02.718 align:start position:0%
so I'm sending that
 
05:52:06.030 --> 05:52:06.040 align:start position:0%
case back to another judge for a
 
05:52:08.910 --> 05:52:08.920 align:start position:0%
redo in that
 
05:52:12.110 --> 05:52:12.120 align:start position:0%
situation the party who doesn't like
 
05:52:14.468 --> 05:52:14.478 align:start position:0%
that ruling doesn't like it being sent
 
05:52:18.070 --> 05:52:18.080 align:start position:0%
back to another judge I feel very
 
05:52:20.510 --> 05:52:20.520 align:start position:0%
strongly should not be able to appeal
 
05:52:23.750 --> 05:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
that decision right then
 
05:52:26.590 --> 05:52:26.600 align:start position:0%
because if the person can appeal right
 
05:52:30.150 --> 05:52:30.160 align:start position:0%
then it's that that's going to be that's
 
05:52:31.750 --> 05:52:31.760 align:start position:0%
what that's going to do is just delay
 
05:52:32.830 --> 05:52:32.840 align:start position:0%
the initial
 
05:52:34.948 --> 05:52:34.958 align:start position:0%
determination rather what makes more
 
05:52:36.430 --> 05:52:36.440 align:start position:0%
sense is to
 
05:52:39.830 --> 05:52:39.840 align:start position:0%
say you can't appeal right then if you
 
05:52:43.110 --> 05:52:43.120 align:start position:0%
are on the losing side of that decision
 
05:52:45.590 --> 05:52:45.600 align:start position:0%
but once it goes back to the other judge
 
05:52:48.990 --> 05:52:49.000 align:start position:0%
for a redo that judge is going to make a
 
05:52:52.030 --> 05:52:52.040 align:start position:0%
decision and if you you know if you are
 
05:52:55.110 --> 05:52:55.120 align:start position:0%
the losing party on the decision to send
 
05:52:56.990 --> 05:52:57.000 align:start position:0%
it back to the
 
05:53:00.388 --> 05:53:00.398 align:start position:0%
judge and you are also the losing party
 
05:53:02.868 --> 05:53:02.878 align:start position:0%
when the judge reconsiders it then you
 
05:53:04.868 --> 05:53:04.878 align:start position:0%
can appeal at that time and you can
 
05:53:08.110 --> 05:53:08.120 align:start position:0%
appeal both decisions it just it's
 
05:53:09.548 --> 05:53:09.558 align:start position:0%
that's a Doctrine in the law called
 
05:53:12.190 --> 05:53:12.200 align:start position:0%
avoiding peace meal appeals and it makes
 
05:53:13.670 --> 05:53:13.680 align:start position:0%
a lot of sense and I think it makes
 
05:53:15.830 --> 05:53:15.840 align:start position:0%
sense here I know that's you know that
 
05:53:19.468 --> 05:53:19.478 align:start position:0%
may be more more legal Nuance than you
 
05:53:21.310 --> 05:53:21.320 align:start position:0%
uh than you want to know about but I
 
05:53:23.948 --> 05:53:23.958 align:start position:0%
think it's I think it it is important
 
05:53:25.548 --> 05:53:25.558 align:start position:0%
with that I'm happy to answer any
 
05:53:28.190 --> 05:53:28.200 align:start position:0%
questions that anyone may have and I'm
 
05:53:30.910 --> 05:53:30.920 align:start position:0%
sorry if I bored you representative
 
05:53:30.920 --> 05:53:32.030 align:start position:0%
sorry if I bored you representative
Manos

05:53:32.030 --> 05:53:32.040 align:start position:0%
Manos
 
05:53:34.150 --> 05:53:34.160 align:start position:0%
please thank you you you would never
 
05:53:36.830 --> 05:53:36.840 align:start position:0%
bore me with this stuff I love it um
 
05:53:38.990 --> 05:53:39.000 align:start position:0%
anyway I wanted I wanted to know about
 
05:53:40.750 --> 05:53:40.760 align:start position:0%
the phrase formal
 
05:53:43.750 --> 05:53:43.760 align:start position:0%
discipline um and I was wondering
 
05:53:46.510 --> 05:53:46.520 align:start position:0%
whether that means public discipline and
 
05:53:49.230 --> 05:53:49.240 align:start position:0%
what if the discipline were private I
 
05:53:51.788 --> 05:53:51.798 align:start position:0%
presume there can be private judicial
 
05:53:51.798 --> 05:53:53.830 align:start position:0%
presume there can be private judicial
discipline

05:53:53.830 --> 05:53:53.840 align:start position:0%
discipline
 
05:53:56.190 --> 05:53:56.200 align:start position:0%
right you know what yes although it's
 
05:53:58.990 --> 05:53:59.000 align:start position:0%
it's it's at a pretty low level I think
 
05:54:00.868 --> 05:54:00.878 align:start position:0%
it if it goes
 
05:54:03.190 --> 05:54:03.200 align:start position:0%
beyond you know like a warrant maybe a
 
05:54:05.510 --> 05:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
warning or U I'm not even sure I think a
 
05:54:08.548 --> 05:54:08.558 align:start position:0%
reprimand even becomes public uh if you
 
05:54:10.590 --> 05:54:10.600 align:start position:0%
know have it's been four years since
 
05:54:12.590 --> 05:54:12.600 align:start position:0%
I've dealt with uh the code of digal
 
05:54:14.430 --> 05:54:14.440 align:start position:0%
conduct but I think that's right I think
 
05:54:18.030 --> 05:54:18.040 align:start position:0%
even a reprimand becomes public so it's
 
05:54:19.548 --> 05:54:19.558 align:start position:0%
would have to be something less than
 
05:54:21.910 --> 05:54:21.920 align:start position:0%
that like maybe a warning would not be
 
05:54:24.190 --> 05:54:24.200 align:start position:0%
public um and if there's somebody from
 
05:54:26.270 --> 05:54:26.280 align:start position:0%
the bar or the the court system here
 
05:54:27.750 --> 05:54:27.760 align:start position:0%
they can correct me if I'm wrong on that
 
05:54:30.190 --> 05:54:30.200 align:start position:0%
but that's my impression it gets to be
 
05:54:32.788 --> 05:54:32.798 align:start position:0%
public at a pretty you know at a pretty
 
05:54:35.310 --> 05:54:35.320 align:start position:0%
low level uh but I think if it was not
 
05:54:37.430 --> 05:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
if it was below that then I then it's
 
05:54:39.708 --> 05:54:39.718 align:start position:0%
not covered by
 
05:54:42.590 --> 05:54:42.600 align:start position:0%
this representative
 
05:54:45.868 --> 05:54:45.878 align:start position:0%
tur yes representative tur oh I'm I'm
 
05:54:47.510 --> 05:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
sorry representative Lyn I've got to con
 
05:54:49.670 --> 05:54:49.680 align:start position:0%
right now thank you you know you give
 
05:54:51.830 --> 05:54:51.840 align:start position:0%
you give somebody power and they forget
 
05:54:54.948 --> 05:54:54.958 align:start position:0%
where they are sorry about that U than
 
05:54:57.628 --> 05:54:57.638 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking the question um I'm
 
05:55:00.948 --> 05:55:00.958 align:start position:0%
just wondering is is is is are there
 
05:55:04.270 --> 05:55:04.280 align:start position:0%
cases that have happened that that that
 
05:55:06.510 --> 05:55:06.520 align:start position:0%
one could look at to sort of see where
 
05:55:09.150 --> 05:55:09.160 align:start position:0%
this would have changed the result is
 
05:55:10.868 --> 05:55:10.878 align:start position:0%
this sort of a is this I guess I'm
 
05:55:12.468 --> 05:55:12.478 align:start position:0%
wondering theoretical or is this
 
05:55:14.468 --> 05:55:14.478 align:start position:0%
something that happens with some
 
05:55:17.990 --> 05:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
frequency um and and there's observable
 
05:55:21.110 --> 05:55:21.120 align:start position:0%
outcomes that that we could say you know
 
05:55:25.150 --> 05:55:25.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:28.110 --> 05:55:28.120 align:start position:0%
I think my answer to that question I'm
 
05:55:30.070 --> 05:55:30.080 align:start position:0%
sure you will hear from other Witnesses
 
05:55:33.910 --> 05:55:33.920 align:start position:0%
something much different my my answer to
 
05:55:36.430 --> 05:55:36.440 align:start position:0%
that question is that it is pretty rare
 
05:55:38.230 --> 05:55:38.240 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying never I Do Not For a
 
05:55:40.868 --> 05:55:40.878 align:start position:0%
Moment say that you know the judicial
 
05:55:42.868 --> 05:55:42.878 align:start position:0%
system in New Hampshire is is there's
 
05:55:46.830 --> 05:55:46.840 align:start position:0%
you know it's it gets an A+ on every
 
05:55:49.430 --> 05:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
single thing but I do think unbalance
 
05:55:51.310 --> 05:55:51.320 align:start position:0%
the judicial system here is pretty darn
 
05:55:54.150 --> 05:55:54.160 align:start position:0%
good um and I think that it instances of
 
05:55:59.708 --> 05:55:59.718 align:start position:0%
misconduct are relatively rare um and
 
05:56:02.788 --> 05:56:02.798 align:start position:0%
where they happen um I
 
05:56:02.798 --> 05:56:06.070 align:start position:0%
where they happen um I
think

05:56:06.070 --> 05:56:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:09.628 --> 05:56:09.638 align:start position:0%
the they tend to be a you know a sort of
 
05:56:11.150 --> 05:56:11.160 align:start position:0%
a pretty
 
05:56:14.788 --> 05:56:14.798 align:start position:0%
discreet situation as opposed
 
05:56:17.990 --> 05:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
to you know I I I don't you know a judge
 
05:56:20.788 --> 05:56:20.798 align:start position:0%
a judge taking a bribe to fix all kind
 
05:56:22.510 --> 05:56:22.520 align:start position:0%
all traffic cases or something like that
 
05:56:24.548 --> 05:56:24.558 align:start position:0%
I have never heard of that uh kind of a
 
05:56:26.948 --> 05:56:26.958 align:start position:0%
thing in in New Hampshire but there are
 
05:56:29.430 --> 05:56:29.440 align:start position:0%
you know there have been some misconduct
 
05:56:29.440 --> 05:56:30.948 align:start position:0%
you know there have been some misconduct
no

05:56:30.948 --> 05:56:30.958 align:start position:0%
no
 
05:56:33.910 --> 05:56:33.920 align:start position:0%
question and just just following up
 
05:56:35.628 --> 05:56:35.638 align:start position:0%
there there's not like a case that you
 
05:56:37.990 --> 05:56:38.000 align:start position:0%
would say would be one that that someone
 
05:56:40.070 --> 05:56:40.080 align:start position:0%
should look at if if they were trying to
 
05:56:41.310 --> 05:56:41.320 align:start position:0%
think through
 
05:56:45.170 --> 05:56:45.180 align:start position:0%
this uh well there's a
 
05:56:45.180 --> 05:56:46.430 align:start position:0%
this uh well there's a
[Music]

05:56:46.430 --> 05:56:46.440 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:56:49.110 --> 05:56:49.120 align:start position:0%
um I mean I can think of two cases
 
05:56:51.468 --> 05:56:51.478 align:start position:0%
unfortunate really really unfortunate
 
05:56:55.110 --> 05:56:55.120 align:start position:0%
situations uh we had one case it really
 
05:56:57.948 --> 05:56:57.958 align:start position:0%
had nothing to do with any you know a
 
05:57:00.670 --> 05:57:00.680 align:start position:0%
judges ruling in any particular decision
 
05:57:01.910 --> 05:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
and by the way these are I can talk
 
05:57:04.150 --> 05:57:04.160 align:start position:0%
about these because they became public
 
05:57:06.990 --> 05:57:07.000 align:start position:0%
we had a judge you know judges are
 
05:57:11.388 --> 05:57:11.398 align:start position:0%
evaluated every three years um uh we had
 
05:57:14.708 --> 05:57:14.718 align:start position:0%
a judge that was and and the way the way
 
05:57:15.868 --> 05:57:15.878 align:start position:0%
that happens is people fill out
 
05:57:17.510 --> 05:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
questioners and they send them back in
 
05:57:23.270 --> 05:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
to to people that um uh uh
 
05:57:25.430 --> 05:57:25.440 align:start position:0%
calculate the the
 
05:57:27.948 --> 05:57:27.958 align:start position:0%
results unfortunately we had a judge who
 
05:57:30.990 --> 05:57:31.000 align:start position:0%
was filling out his own questioners and
 
05:57:32.110 --> 05:57:32.120 align:start position:0%
submitting them as if they were
 
05:57:34.150 --> 05:57:34.160 align:start position:0%
submitted by you know members of the
 
05:57:37.670 --> 05:57:37.680 align:start position:0%
public um and as you might expect uh he
 
05:57:40.150 --> 05:57:40.160 align:start position:0%
was not giving himself bad
 
05:57:43.948 --> 05:57:43.958 align:start position:0%
ratings um that was discovered I have to
 
05:57:46.430 --> 05:57:46.440 align:start position:0%
EMP this is really really important that
 
05:57:46.440 --> 05:57:47.910 align:start position:0%
EMP this is really really important that
was

05:57:47.910 --> 05:57:47.920 align:start position:0%
was
 
05:57:51.868 --> 05:57:51.878 align:start position:0%
discovered by uh administrators and the
 
05:57:53.830 --> 05:57:53.840 align:start position:0%
administr judge in the C it was a
 
05:57:55.070 --> 05:57:55.080 align:start position:0%
circuit court judge that this was
 
05:57:58.110 --> 05:57:58.120 align:start position:0%
happening but it was discovered by that
 
05:58:00.350 --> 05:58:00.360 align:start position:0%
administrative uh judge and the the
 
05:58:04.030 --> 05:58:04.040 align:start position:0%
administrator in the Circuit Court um
 
05:58:05.868 --> 05:58:05.878 align:start position:0%
that you know that that uh that that
 
05:58:09.030 --> 05:58:09.040 align:start position:0%
happened and that person is no longer a
 
05:58:13.868 --> 05:58:13.878 align:start position:0%
judge um the uh the other the other one
 
05:58:15.468 --> 05:58:15.478 align:start position:0%
that I that I
 
05:58:17.628 --> 05:58:17.638 align:start position:0%
don't really don't know much about the
 
05:58:19.310 --> 05:58:19.320 align:start position:0%
details but it's obviously been in the
 
05:58:21.270 --> 05:58:21.280 align:start position:0%
in the papers you've probably heard you
 
05:58:23.110 --> 05:58:23.120 align:start position:0%
know there was a judge who allegedly had
 
05:58:28.350 --> 05:58:28.360 align:start position:0%
a had a friendship with a um with a uh
 
05:58:30.788 --> 05:58:30.798 align:start position:0%
Guardian atam I believe and
 
05:58:34.070 --> 05:58:34.080 align:start position:0%
was uh was because of that friendship
 
05:58:35.708 --> 05:58:35.718 align:start position:0%
was making
 
05:58:39.670 --> 05:58:39.680 align:start position:0%
um uh appointed that Guardian at
 
05:58:43.230 --> 05:58:43.240 align:start position:0%
lium in circumstances where where where
 
05:58:44.948 --> 05:58:44.958 align:start position:0%
you know that maybe that that shouldn't
 
05:58:46.430 --> 05:58:46.440 align:start position:0%
have been done and apparently there was
 
05:58:48.030 --> 05:58:48.040 align:start position:0%
an allegation if I understand correctly
 
05:58:50.110 --> 05:58:50.120 align:start position:0%
that that Guardian at lightam was sort
 
05:58:50.120 --> 05:58:51.110 align:start position:0%
that that Guardian at lightam was sort
of

05:58:51.110 --> 05:58:51.120 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:58:54.868 --> 05:58:54.878 align:start position:0%
billing uh was billing more time than
 
05:58:58.110 --> 05:58:58.120 align:start position:0%
was justified and the judge was
 
05:59:00.910 --> 05:59:00.920 align:start position:0%
approving that I don't believe and I
 
05:59:02.270 --> 05:59:02.280 align:start position:0%
again somebody could correct me if I'm
 
05:59:03.670 --> 05:59:03.680 align:start position:0%
wrong because I was not personally
 
05:59:06.070 --> 05:59:06.080 align:start position:0%
involved in in any part of this case I
 
05:59:08.590 --> 05:59:08.600 align:start position:0%
don't believe there was any claim that
 
05:59:12.910 --> 05:59:12.920 align:start position:0%
the judge was somehow you know on
 
05:59:14.750 --> 05:59:14.760 align:start position:0%
getting a portion of the of the
 
05:59:17.230 --> 05:59:17.240 align:start position:0%
Guardians fees or anything like that the
 
05:59:19.230 --> 05:59:19.240 align:start position:0%
claim was simply that because they were
 
05:59:22.270 --> 05:59:22.280 align:start position:0%
friends the guard the judge was uh was
 
05:59:24.708 --> 05:59:24.718 align:start position:0%
was you know overly generous in
 
05:59:27.030 --> 05:59:27.040 align:start position:0%
approving uh or being less critical than
 
05:59:29.190 --> 05:59:29.200 align:start position:0%
she should have been on the uh on the
 
05:59:30.708 --> 05:59:30.718 align:start position:0%
bills that were submitted by the
 
05:59:32.670 --> 05:59:32.680 align:start position:0%
guardian that that's my understanding
 
05:59:34.110 --> 05:59:34.120 align:start position:0%
anyway of it but those are those are
 
05:59:37.230 --> 05:59:37.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:39.190 --> 05:59:39.200 align:start position:0%
examples I'm happy to answer any other
 
05:59:40.110 --> 05:59:40.120 align:start position:0%
question any other questions for
 
05:59:40.120 --> 05:59:42.868 align:start position:0%
question any other questions for

opposed to this bill as it's in
 
06:00:28.270 --> 06:00:28.280 align:start position:0%
expedient um it's not necessary article
 
06:00:30.990 --> 06:00:31.000 align:start position:0%
8 of the New Hampshire
 
06:00:34.430 --> 06:00:34.440 align:start position:0%
Constitution uh already holds our
 
06:00:36.070 --> 06:00:36.080 align:start position:0%
government accountable but what we're
 
06:00:38.150 --> 06:00:38.160 align:start position:0%
actually happen happen what's actually
 
06:00:41.230 --> 06:00:41.240 align:start position:0%
happening on the streets or courtrooms
 
06:00:44.910 --> 06:00:44.920 align:start position:0%
and to me the courtroom is is a church
 
06:00:48.230 --> 06:00:48.240 align:start position:0%
where you go to find Justice the truth
 
06:00:51.190 --> 06:00:51.200 align:start position:0%
and uh and be treated fairly uh we're
 
06:00:53.230 --> 06:00:53.240 align:start position:0%
not having that and and I've gone to
 
06:00:54.708 --> 06:00:54.718 align:start position:0%
other courts and it's really with the
 
06:00:57.708 --> 06:00:57.718 align:start position:0%
family courts what we need to do is we
 
06:01:00.190 --> 06:01:00.200 align:start position:0%
need to repeal
 
06:01:04.468 --> 06:01:04.478 align:start position:0%
173b it's unconstitutional Article 15 of
 
06:01:06.150 --> 06:01:06.160 align:start position:0%

06:01:20.110 --> 06:01:20.120 align:start position:0%
a legal counsel to you and also prove
 
06:01:22.468 --> 06:01:22.478 align:start position:0%
Beyond A Reasonable Doubt and and with
 
06:01:24.070 --> 06:01:24.080 align:start position:0%
there's plenty of instances where this
 
06:01:27.628 --> 06:01:27.638 align:start position:0%
hasn't happened and so I've already uh
 
06:01:29.830 --> 06:01:29.840 align:start position:0%
sent to all your attention
 
06:01:32.670 --> 06:01:32.680 align:start position:0%
um the extreme conflicts of interest
 
06:01:33.948 --> 06:01:33.958 align:start position:0%
that are happening in New Hampshire
 
06:01:36.910 --> 06:01:36.920 align:start position:0%
courts and I'll describe those in my
 
06:01:36.920 --> 06:01:38.150 align:start position:0%
courts and I'll describe those in my
personal

06:01:38.150 --> 06:01:38.160 align:start position:0%
personal
 
06:01:38.160 --> 06:01:40.388 align:start position:0%
personal
capacity

06:01:40.388 --> 06:01:40.398 align:start position:0%
capacity
 
06:01:43.510 --> 06:01:43.520 align:start position:0%
um the the judicial referee wrote
 
06:01:45.230 --> 06:01:45.240 align:start position:0%
physically and mathematically impossible
 
06:01:49.388 --> 06:01:49.398 align:start position:0%
findings of fact I gave a notice to the
 
06:01:53.230 --> 06:01:53.240 align:start position:0%
clerk and she um
 
06:01:54.590 --> 06:01:54.600 align:start position:0%
dismissed it and passed it to another
 
06:01:56.150 --> 06:01:56.160 align:start position:0%
judge and then another judge and I'm
 
06:01:58.468 --> 06:01:58.478 align:start position:0%
these are signed
 
06:02:01.150 --> 06:02:01.160 align:start position:0%
affidavits and so what we found in my
 
06:02:04.190 --> 06:02:04.200 align:start position:0%
research um is that there's a rule
 
06:02:07.030 --> 06:02:07.040 align:start position:0%
called RSA 21
 
06:02:10.708 --> 06:02:10.718 align:start position:0%
G25 it's a law I apologize and it goes
 
06:02:12.788 --> 06:02:12.798 align:start position:0%
from the Constitution the laws God gives
 
06:02:15.628 --> 06:02:15.638 align:start position:0%
us our constitutional rights or nature
 
06:02:17.310 --> 06:02:17.320 align:start position:0%
and so this
 
06:02:20.948 --> 06:02:20.958 align:start position:0%
21g um it says
 
06:02:20.958 --> 06:02:23.070 align:start position:0%
21g um it says
that

06:02:23.070 --> 06:02:23.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:02:26.230 --> 06:02:26.240 align:start position:0%
the lobbyists or companies that employ
 
06:02:29.230 --> 06:02:29.240 align:start position:0%
lobbyists are not allowed to be on any
 
06:02:33.030 --> 06:02:33.040 align:start position:0%
commission yet we have a legal testimony
 
06:02:33.040 --> 06:02:35.190 align:start position:0%
commission yet we have a legal testimony
in

06:02:35.190 --> 06:02:35.200 align:start position:0%
in
 
06:02:38.190 --> 06:02:38.200 align:start position:0%
this uh room and also in the special
 
06:02:39.910 --> 06:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
committee anything that came from the
 
06:02:43.350 --> 06:02:43.360 align:start position:0%
domestic violence Coalition Lynn chanet
 
06:02:46.190 --> 06:02:46.200 align:start position:0%
and three other registered lobbyists is
 
06:02:48.708 --> 06:02:48.718 align:start position:0%
a legal testimony and it's been brought
 
06:02:51.270 --> 06:02:51.280 align:start position:0%
to the attention and uh nobody's doing
 
06:02:53.350 --> 06:02:53.360 align:start position:0%
anything about it just ignore it and
 
06:02:55.670 --> 06:02:55.680 align:start position:0%
this is because she's Lynch manette is
 
06:02:58.510 --> 06:02:58.520 align:start position:0%
on the governor's domestic violence
 
06:03:01.510 --> 06:03:01.520 align:start position:0%
commission and the Supreme Court task
 
06:03:04.670 --> 06:03:04.680 align:start position:0%
force which has judicial referee I mean
 
06:03:06.910 --> 06:03:06.920 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry uh Supreme Court Justice Hans
 
06:03:09.830 --> 06:03:09.840 align:start position:0%
Marone who's a member of the women's Bar
 
06:03:15.628 --> 06:03:15.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:18.030 --> 06:03:18.040 align:start position:0%
2023 the domestic violence Coalition got
 
06:03:20.310 --> 06:03:20.320 align:start position:0%
$2.4 million signed by the
 
06:03:23.110 --> 06:03:23.120 align:start position:0%
governor and yet she
 
06:03:26.310 --> 06:03:26.320 align:start position:0%
lobbies and then also heads that
 
06:03:27.910 --> 06:03:27.920 align:start position:0%
commission which was at the Supreme
 
06:03:29.868 --> 06:03:29.878 align:start position:0%
Court on November 17th
 
06:03:32.270 --> 06:03:32.280 align:start position:0%
2022 and I'll go through the things that
 
06:03:34.310 --> 06:03:34.320 align:start position:0%
happened I was at the Supreme Court Lyn
 
06:03:35.830 --> 06:03:35.840 align:start position:0%
shanet was
 
06:03:38.030 --> 06:03:38.040 align:start position:0%
there running the meeting where they
 
06:03:39.750 --> 06:03:39.760 align:start position:0%
talked about wiretap
 
06:03:41.670 --> 06:03:41.680 align:start position:0%
laws and they're really part of a
 
06:03:43.548 --> 06:03:43.558 align:start position:0%
nationwide organization the National
 
06:03:45.548 --> 06:03:45.558 align:start position:0%
Domestic Violence Coalition and then
 
06:03:47.750 --> 06:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
when you go from
 
06:03:50.868 --> 06:03:50.878 align:start position:0%
there um later that day I come into
 
06:03:53.150 --> 06:03:53.160 align:start position:0%
Governor shunu office office and on
 
06:03:55.830 --> 06:03:55.840 align:start position:0%
there so this is November 17th there's a
 
06:03:58.310 --> 06:03:58.320 align:start position:0%
letter that was written to me saying
 
06:03:59.830 --> 06:03:59.840 align:start position:0%
I've been talking to them for a year
 
06:04:01.830 --> 06:04:01.840 align:start position:0%
trying to expose this but basically a
 
06:04:03.990 --> 06:04:04.000 align:start position:0%
letter they wrote To Me November 2nd
 
06:04:07.468 --> 06:04:07.478 align:start position:0%
November 8th $2.4 million is given to
 
06:04:10.708 --> 06:04:10.718 align:start position:0%
the Coalition November 17th when I was
 
06:04:13.150 --> 06:04:13.160 align:start position:0%
there on the desk in the governor's
 
06:04:17.270 --> 06:04:17.280 align:start position:0%
office was a email from Jennifer Smith
 
06:04:19.430 --> 06:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
defaming me Robert tangu saying
 
06:04:20.910 --> 06:04:20.920 align:start position:0%
basically I'm crazy saying that I have
 
06:04:23.030 --> 06:04:23.040 align:start position:0%
to get a psychologic iCal examination
 
06:04:26.910 --> 06:04:26.920 align:start position:0%
which is not true and that uh I'm not
 
06:04:28.788 --> 06:04:28.798 align:start position:0%
allowed to see my children without
 
06:04:30.910 --> 06:04:30.920 align:start position:0%
supervised visits unless I get that
 
06:04:32.670 --> 06:04:32.680 align:start position:0%
psychological evaluation which is not
 
06:04:34.948 --> 06:04:34.958 align:start position:0%
true I'm a registered lobbyist I'm here
 
06:04:36.788 --> 06:04:36.798 align:start position:0%
on my own behalf I have nobody has paid
 
06:04:39.110 --> 06:04:39.120 align:start position:0%
me to be here I'm here to save my
 
06:04:42.070 --> 06:04:42.080 align:start position:0%
children and um so with that those facts
 
06:04:43.590 --> 06:04:43.600 align:start position:0%
have been presented to people it's very
 
06:04:45.510 --> 06:04:45.520 align:start position:0%
important that this is on the record and
 
06:04:47.430 --> 06:04:47.440 align:start position:0%
that anything that the domestic violence
 
06:04:50.190 --> 06:04:50.200 align:start position:0%
Coalition has touched during these
 
06:04:53.868 --> 06:04:53.878 align:start position:0%
periods of time from 202 21 I believe to
 
06:04:55.948 --> 06:04:55.958 align:start position:0%
November 17th and they just canceled
 
06:04:58.628 --> 06:04:58.638 align:start position:0%
their meeting all bills going forward
 
06:05:01.430 --> 06:05:01.440 align:start position:0%
are tainted all funds going forward are
 
06:05:04.548 --> 06:05:04.558 align:start position:0%
tainted and then um just to just bring
 
06:05:07.868 --> 06:05:07.878 align:start position:0%
up so 173b that we have judges that are
 
06:05:09.948 --> 06:05:09.958 align:start position:0%
just breaking the law it's it's what I
 
06:05:12.310 --> 06:05:12.320 align:start position:0%
call paper stuffing they paper stuff you
 
06:05:15.510 --> 06:05:15.520 align:start position:0%
for use of a better word uh that is in
 
06:05:18.310 --> 06:05:18.320 align:start position:0%
appropriate to the decorum of this room
 
06:05:20.110 --> 06:05:20.120 align:start position:0%
uh they paper stuff you they just throw
 
06:05:22.190 --> 06:05:22.200 align:start position:0%
lies at you they write false narrative
 
06:05:24.150 --> 06:05:24.160 align:start position:0%
they break the law they provide no
 
06:05:26.190 --> 06:05:26.200 align:start position:0%
justification and this is the level of
 
06:05:29.948 --> 06:05:29.958 align:start position:0%
my pleadings they are very very good
 
06:05:32.310 --> 06:05:32.320 align:start position:0%
they are very well done but they
 
06:05:34.548 --> 06:05:34.558 align:start position:0%
retaliate proos against prosay
 
06:05:38.230 --> 06:05:38.240 align:start position:0%
individuals so this bill is
 
06:05:41.430 --> 06:05:41.440 align:start position:0%
inexpedient we need to repeal 173b we
 
06:05:44.310 --> 06:05:44.320 align:start position:0%
need to look at before you go with any
 
06:05:47.628 --> 06:05:47.638 align:start position:0%
bill you need to read the Constitution
 
06:05:49.750 --> 06:05:49.760 align:start position:0%
and then the bills that are repugnant to
 
06:05:52.070 --> 06:05:52.080 align:start position:0%
the Constitution shouldn't move forward
 
06:05:55.868 --> 06:05:55.878 align:start position:0%
this enhances it but but where this bill
 
06:05:58.468 --> 06:05:58.478 align:start position:0%
was derived from is uh one that was made
 
06:06:01.350 --> 06:06:01.360 align:start position:0%
in 2001 which the Supreme Court made a
 
06:06:05.310 --> 06:06:05.320 align:start position:0%
rule we need a commission internally for
 
06:06:07.670 --> 06:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
the balance of powers we need to
 
06:06:09.628 --> 06:06:09.638 align:start position:0%
counterbalance and then by having a
 
06:06:12.190 --> 06:06:12.200 align:start position:0%
commission you can't have lobbyists or
 
06:06:14.070 --> 06:06:14.080 align:start position:0%
people who employ lobbyists on that
 
06:06:16.150 --> 06:06:16.160 align:start position:0%
commission so that's what's happening
 
06:06:17.868 --> 06:06:17.878 align:start position:0%
and it's it's really what
 
06:06:17.878 --> 06:06:20.230 align:start position:0%
and it's it's really what
sununu's

06:06:20.230 --> 06:06:20.240 align:start position:0%
sununu's
 
06:06:22.670 --> 06:06:22.680 align:start position:0%
um administ ministration it's very
 
06:06:24.388 --> 06:06:24.398 align:start position:0%
corrupt and I've been having a lot of
 
06:06:25.948 --> 06:06:25.958 align:start position:0%
problems with it I would appreciate any
 
06:06:28.510 --> 06:06:28.520 align:start position:0%
questions I could talk for almost as
 
06:06:30.510 --> 06:06:30.520 align:start position:0%
long as uh Mr Lynn but I would
 
06:06:32.270 --> 06:06:32.280 align:start position:0%

seeing none thank you thank you um I I
 
06:07:28.350 --> 06:07:28.360 align:start position:0%
just want to draw special attention to
 
06:07:30.670 --> 06:07:30.680 align:start position:0%
article two natural rights article 3
 
06:07:34.670 --> 06:07:34.680 align:start position:0%
society and its uh organ organization of
 
06:07:37.310 --> 06:07:37.320 align:start position:0%
purposes and rights of conscious
 
06:07:40.030 --> 06:07:40.040 align:start position:0%
unan I also want to bring attention to
 
06:07:43.750 --> 06:07:43.760 align:start position:0%
the classifications of crimes RSA 625
 
06:07:47.708 --> 06:07:47.718 align:start position:0%
colon 9 where it describes that violence
 
06:07:49.548 --> 06:07:49.558 align:start position:0%
is a
 
06:07:53.030 --> 06:07:53.040 align:start position:0%
physical or severe bodily injury
 
06:07:55.948 --> 06:07:55.958 align:start position:0%
violence is not emotional or the threat
 
06:07:59.110 --> 06:07:59.120 align:start position:0%
of physical so they have Jerry Mander
 
06:08:00.948 --> 06:08:00.958 align:start position:0%
the family courts and they have Jerry
 
06:08:00.958 --> 06:08:02.350 align:start position:0%
the family courts and they have Jerry
Mander

06:08:02.350 --> 06:08:02.360 align:start position:0%
Mander
 
06:08:06.190 --> 06:08:06.200 align:start position:0%
our idea which is by Statute of what
 
06:08:08.868 --> 06:08:08.878 align:start position:0%
violence is violence is not a
 
06:08:11.150 --> 06:08:11.160 align:start position:0%
disagreement violence is not a sad hurt
 
06:08:13.468 --> 06:08:13.478 align:start position:0%
feelings or wishing that the husband
 
06:08:15.150 --> 06:08:15.160 align:start position:0%
made more money or the
 
06:08:17.750 --> 06:08:17.760 align:start position:0%
woman was in better shape or whatever it
 
06:08:20.388 --> 06:08:20.398 align:start position:0%
may be thank you so much for
 
06:08:20.398 --> 06:08:22.910 align:start position:0%
may be thank you so much for
everybody

06:08:22.910 --> 06:08:22.920 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
06:08:33.070 --> 06:08:33.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:35.990 --> 06:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
alch good afternoon Mr chair and members
 
06:08:38.350 --> 06:08:38.360 align:start position:0%
of the committee thank you for having me
 
06:08:41.708 --> 06:08:41.718 align:start position:0%
my name is Dana alre from nashaa I'm a
 
06:08:45.590 --> 06:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
father of four and uh this isn't
 
06:08:47.468 --> 06:08:47.478 align:start position:0%
theoretical to
 
06:08:52.628 --> 06:08:52.638 align:start position:0%
me uh a point earlier uh three judges
 
06:08:54.948 --> 06:08:54.958 align:start position:0%
with proven findings of
 
06:08:57.350 --> 06:08:57.360 align:start position:0%
misconduct uh have been involved in my
 
06:09:00.230 --> 06:09:00.240 align:start position:0%
case the first being Paul Moore who
 
06:09:03.150 --> 06:09:03.160 align:start position:0%
signed the very first order in my case
 
06:09:06.430 --> 06:09:06.440 align:start position:0%
uh that replin alluded to earlier with
 
06:09:10.910 --> 06:09:10.920 align:start position:0%
the uh ballot stuffing on the
 
06:09:10.920 --> 06:09:12.990 align:start position:0%
the uh ballot stuffing on the
evaluations

06:09:12.990 --> 06:09:13.000 align:start position:0%
evaluations
 
06:09:19.868 --> 06:09:19.878 align:start position:0%
um the uh second of which was Julie and
 
06:09:25.190 --> 06:09:25.200 align:start position:0%
traso uh Julian traso was uh I am one of
 
06:09:28.030 --> 06:09:28.040 align:start position:0%
the nine cases in which Julian traso
 
06:09:30.230 --> 06:09:30.240 align:start position:0%
appointed her close friend Kathleen
 
06:09:34.030 --> 06:09:34.040 align:start position:0%
Sternberg and improved uh improper Fe
 
06:09:36.948 --> 06:09:36.958 align:start position:0%
increases so I'm one of those too and
 
06:09:39.350 --> 06:09:39.360 align:start position:0%
last but not least and specifically
 
06:09:43.230 --> 06:09:43.240 align:start position:0%
because of my case uh marital master
 
06:09:46.910 --> 06:09:46.920 align:start position:0%
dapra Bruce dapra was removed from the
 
06:09:49.990 --> 06:09:50.000 align:start position:0%
bench again we have a supreme court
 
06:09:52.030 --> 06:09:52.040 align:start position:0%
order on that
 
06:09:55.150 --> 06:09:55.160 align:start position:0%
uh so unfortunately I feel uniquely
 
06:09:58.030 --> 06:09:58.040 align:start position:0%
qualified here this isn't
 
06:10:01.628 --> 06:10:01.638 align:start position:0%
theoretical and I guess to quote Katniss
 
06:10:04.190 --> 06:10:04.200 align:start position:0%
everine I guess I volunteer as tribute
 
06:10:08.670 --> 06:10:08.680 align:start position:0%
to testify about this so everybody
 
06:10:08.680 --> 06:10:09.948 align:start position:0%
to testify about this so everybody
should

06:10:09.948 --> 06:10:09.958 align:start position:0%
should
 
06:10:09.958 --> 06:10:11.468 align:start position:0%
should
have

06:10:11.468 --> 06:10:11.478 align:start position:0%
have
 
06:10:15.388 --> 06:10:15.398 align:start position:0%
uh three handouts from me first is an
 
06:10:18.070 --> 06:10:18.080 align:start position:0%
exhibit list Mr alberch the committee
 
06:10:19.948 --> 06:10:19.958 align:start position:0%
has all your your exhibits we will read
 
06:10:21.388 --> 06:10:21.398 align:start position:0%
through them if continue with your
 
06:10:22.750 --> 06:10:22.760 align:start position:0%
verbal testimony that would be greatly
 
06:10:24.670 --> 06:10:24.680 align:start position:0%
appreciated thank you okay just to
 
06:10:28.190 --> 06:10:28.200 align:start position:0%
remind you what you I exhibit list
 
06:10:31.750 --> 06:10:31.760 align:start position:0%
uh deposition of Judge David
 
06:10:35.750 --> 06:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
King and uh deposition of honorable
 
06:10:44.670 --> 06:10:44.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:44.680 --> 06:10:47.388 align:start position:0%
 
testimony

06:10:47.388 --> 06:10:47.398 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
06:10:51.830 --> 06:10:51.840 align:start position:0%
so uh first and foremost the issue I see
 
06:10:53.350 --> 06:10:53.360 align:start position:0%
with this
 
06:10:57.030 --> 06:10:57.040 align:start position:0%
bill is that it would ask an AG grieved
 
06:10:58.990 --> 06:10:59.000 align:start position:0%
party and I think in this case I count
 
06:11:02.750 --> 06:11:02.760 align:start position:0%
with the three different findings uh to
 
06:11:05.468 --> 06:11:05.478 align:start position:0%
go to the administrative judge for
 
06:11:09.468 --> 06:11:09.478 align:start position:0%
Relief the problem with
 
06:11:12.830 --> 06:11:12.840 align:start position:0%
that uh is in my opinion the
 
06:11:15.388 --> 06:11:15.398 align:start position:0%
administrative judge is personally
 
06:11:17.548 --> 06:11:17.558 align:start position:0%
responsible for much of this
 
06:11:22.070 --> 06:11:22.080 align:start position:0%
debacle and actively covered it up
 
06:11:24.190 --> 06:11:24.200 align:start position:0%
uh if you have a look at the
 
06:11:26.708 --> 06:11:26.718 align:start position:0%
exhibits in my
 
06:11:30.548 --> 06:11:30.558 align:start position:0%
case uh Master dapra committed proven
 
06:11:32.708 --> 06:11:32.718 align:start position:0%
misconduct November 6
 
06:11:35.948 --> 06:11:35.958 align:start position:0%
2020 within one week of that the
 
06:11:38.750 --> 06:11:38.760 align:start position:0%
administrative judge was fully
 
06:11:43.310 --> 06:11:43.320 align:start position:0%
aware uh that that uh misconduct was
 
06:11:45.788 --> 06:11:45.798 align:start position:0%
being deliberately admitted from
 
06:11:47.868 --> 06:11:47.878 align:start position:0%
official transcripts in my case so we
 
06:11:49.548 --> 06:11:49.558 align:start position:0%
have a falsified
 
06:11:53.590 --> 06:11:53.600 align:start position:0%
record uh and he did nothing about it
 
06:11:56.990 --> 06:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
when that went to The JCC you'll see
 
06:12:00.350 --> 06:12:00.360 align:start position:0%
exhibit 3 on 216
 
06:12:05.388 --> 06:12:05.398 align:start position:0%
2021 uh The JCC actually dismissed it uh
 
06:12:07.750 --> 06:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
the complaint against Master Del
 
06:12:10.868 --> 06:12:10.878 align:start position:0%
pra uh claiming there was no likelihood
 
06:12:10.878 --> 06:12:12.150 align:start position:0%
pra uh claiming there was no likelihood
of

06:12:12.150 --> 06:12:12.160 align:start position:0%
of
 
06:12:14.548 --> 06:12:14.558 align:start position:0%
misconduct uh and again judge king was
 
06:12:17.510 --> 06:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
aware of that at that time as well and
 
06:12:17.520 --> 06:12:18.708 align:start position:0%
aware of that at that time as well and
did

06:12:18.708 --> 06:12:18.718 align:start position:0%
did
 
06:12:22.110 --> 06:12:22.120 align:start position:0%
nothing by the time you get to to uh
 
06:12:25.910 --> 06:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
exhibit 4 uh December 16th
 
06:12:30.150 --> 06:12:30.160 align:start position:0%
2021 you have a final uh New Hampshire
 
06:12:33.310 --> 06:12:33.320 align:start position:0%
supreme court order in my case I think
 
06:12:35.388 --> 06:12:35.398 align:start position:0%
the relevant portion the whole order is
 
06:12:37.430 --> 06:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
in the packet but the relevant portions
 
06:12:39.590 --> 06:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
are highlighted in
 
06:12:44.110 --> 06:12:44.120 align:start position:0%
yellow um essentially because of Judge
 
06:12:46.788 --> 06:12:46.798 align:start position:0%
King the Supreme Court was sent on a
 
06:12:48.350 --> 06:12:48.360 align:start position:0%
wild goose
 
06:12:51.868 --> 06:12:51.878 align:start position:0%
chase ordering three different
 
06:12:54.670 --> 06:12:54.680 align:start position:0%
copies versions of What should be an
 
06:12:56.430 --> 06:12:56.440 align:start position:0%
official transcript over the course of
 
06:12:56.440 --> 06:12:57.468 align:start position:0%
official transcript over the course of
two

06:12:57.468 --> 06:12:57.478 align:start position:0%
two
 
06:12:59.990 --> 06:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
years when he knew there was a problem
 
06:13:02.270 --> 06:13:02.280 align:start position:0%
within a week of the
 
06:13:02.280 --> 06:13:04.030 align:start position:0%
within a week of the
event

06:13:04.030 --> 06:13:04.040 align:start position:0%
event
 
06:13:06.708 --> 06:13:06.718 align:start position:0%
um if so we kind of sent the Supreme
 
06:13:08.590 --> 06:13:08.600 align:start position:0%
Court on a wild goose
 
06:13:11.670 --> 06:13:11.680 align:start position:0%
chase uh when you look at exhibit five
 
06:13:13.750 --> 06:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
now we're out in April of
 
06:13:16.788 --> 06:13:16.798 align:start position:0%
2022 we've got the New
 
06:13:20.070 --> 06:13:20.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh Attorney General's office
 
06:13:20.080 --> 06:13:22.190 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh Attorney General's office
investigating

06:13:22.190 --> 06:13:22.200 align:start position:0%
investigating
 
06:13:25.510 --> 06:13:25.520 align:start position:0%
uh the AG's office public Integrity unit
 
06:13:29.230 --> 06:13:29.240 align:start position:0%
uh you've got a letter there uh
 
06:13:32.230 --> 06:13:32.240 align:start position:0%
investing irregularities in the
 
06:13:36.430 --> 06:13:36.440 align:start position:0%
transcript and once again uh they got it
 
06:13:39.788 --> 06:13:39.798 align:start position:0%
wrong uh kind of lacking knowledge of
 
06:13:42.830 --> 06:13:42.840 align:start position:0%
Judge King's involvement and cover up
 
06:13:48.270 --> 06:13:48.280 align:start position:0%
even by then uh Mr chair so excuse me
 
06:13:53.070 --> 06:13:53.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:56.030 --> 06:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
um all this information is very
 
06:13:58.548 --> 06:13:58.558 align:start position:0%
interesting from an hysterical point of
 
06:14:00.788 --> 06:14:00.798 align:start position:0%
view some of it some of us have seen
 
06:14:05.590 --> 06:14:05.600 align:start position:0%
before and not my question however is
 
06:14:08.868 --> 06:14:08.878 align:start position:0%
could you please tell us
 
06:14:12.670 --> 06:14:12.680 align:start position:0%
exactly what relates to the pending
 
06:14:16.190 --> 06:14:16.200 align:start position:0%
legislation we are not here to rehear
 
06:14:19.230 --> 06:14:19.240 align:start position:0%
any of your cases or anything that may
 
06:14:22.150 --> 06:14:22.160 align:start position:0%
have gone right or wrong what we need to
 
06:14:24.788 --> 06:14:24.798 align:start position:0%
know is looking at the bill that's
 
06:14:27.270 --> 06:14:27.280 align:start position:0%
before the committee do you agree with
 
06:14:29.590 --> 06:14:29.600 align:start position:0%
the bill do you disagree with the bill
 
06:14:31.990 --> 06:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
how would you change it so if you can
 
06:14:34.070 --> 06:14:34.080 align:start position:0%
confine your if that's all right with
 
06:14:36.350 --> 06:14:36.360 align:start position:0%
the chair if you could confine your
 
06:14:39.670 --> 06:14:39.680 align:start position:0%
testimony to that rather than going back
 
06:14:39.680 --> 06:14:40.590 align:start position:0%
testimony to that rather than going back
yet

06:14:40.590 --> 06:14:40.600 align:start position:0%
yet
 
06:14:45.030 --> 06:14:45.040 align:start position:0%
again over matters that are incredibly
 
06:14:47.030 --> 06:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
important to you and therefore to this
 
06:14:49.468 --> 06:14:49.478 align:start position:0%
committee but not necessarily relevant
 
06:14:52.468 --> 06:14:52.478 align:start position:0%
to the bill uh I think it's directly
 
06:14:54.590 --> 06:14:54.600 align:start position:0%
relevant to the representative Smith
 
06:15:01.150 --> 06:15:01.160 align:start position:0%
because if you look at uh page one uh
 
06:15:02.590 --> 06:15:02.600 align:start position:0%
line 17
 
06:15:07.110 --> 06:15:07.120 align:start position:0%
18 the relief is supposed to go is a
 
06:15:09.590 --> 06:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
petition to the Chief Justice or
 
06:15:12.628 --> 06:15:12.638 align:start position:0%
administrative judge of the court and if
 
06:15:12.638 --> 06:15:13.590 align:start position:0%
administrative judge of the court and if
the

06:15:13.590 --> 06:15:13.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:15:16.190 --> 06:15:16.200 align:start position:0%
problem is the administrative judge of
 
06:15:19.230 --> 06:15:19.240 align:start position:0%
the court in the first place
 
06:15:24.510 --> 06:15:24.520 align:start position:0%
you're asking the person who
 
06:15:24.520 --> 06:15:28.030 align:start position:0%
you're asking the person who
potentially

06:15:28.030 --> 06:15:28.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:28.040 --> 06:15:29.670 align:start position:0%
 
uh

06:15:29.670 --> 06:15:29.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:15:32.788 --> 06:15:32.798 align:start position:0%
um was UN potentially untruthful under
 
06:15:35.430 --> 06:15:35.440 align:start position:0%
oath in his deposition to the judicial
 
06:15:38.110 --> 06:15:38.120 align:start position:0%
conduct committee for
 
06:15:38.120 --> 06:15:39.990 align:start position:0%
conduct committee for
Relief

06:15:39.990 --> 06:15:40.000 align:start position:0%
Relief
 
06:15:42.830 --> 06:15:42.840 align:start position:0%
um you know that's like asking the the
 
06:15:45.150 --> 06:15:45.160 align:start position:0%
fox to guard the hen
 
06:15:48.230 --> 06:15:48.240 align:start position:0%
house the bill asked me to seek relief
 
06:15:49.708 --> 06:15:49.718 align:start position:0%
from the very
 
06:15:49.718 --> 06:15:51.310 align:start position:0%
from the very
individual

06:15:51.310 --> 06:15:51.320 align:start position:0%
individual
 
06:15:54.468 --> 06:15:54.478 align:start position:0%
who is probably most responsible for
 
06:15:56.788 --> 06:15:56.798 align:start position:0%
this debacle in the first
 
06:15:58.948 --> 06:15:58.958 align:start position:0%
place it's right in the bill I'm
 
06:16:00.350 --> 06:16:00.360 align:start position:0%
supposed to go to the administrative
 
06:16:02.110 --> 06:16:02.120 align:start position:0%
judge well I'm talking about the
 
06:16:04.430 --> 06:16:04.440 align:start position:0%
administrative judge that's the direct
 
06:16:07.590 --> 06:16:07.600 align:start position:0%
relevance of the bill you have the
 
06:16:10.110 --> 06:16:10.120 align:start position:0%
deposition of the administrative Mr Al
 
06:16:11.990 --> 06:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
if I can ask you a question is your
 
06:16:14.868 --> 06:16:14.878 align:start position:0%
matter settled at this point in
 
06:16:18.990 --> 06:16:19.000 align:start position:0%
time uh I it's a yes or no question what
 
06:16:20.468 --> 06:16:20.478 align:start position:0%
is your matter settled at this point in
 
06:16:22.708 --> 06:16:22.718 align:start position:0%
time you've brought us um quite a
 
06:16:24.350 --> 06:16:24.360 align:start position:0%
substantial amount of documents so is
 
06:16:26.510 --> 06:16:26.520 align:start position:0%
your case settled at this point in
 
06:16:29.708 --> 06:16:29.718 align:start position:0%
time uh I have a pending uh I've asked
 
06:16:31.708 --> 06:16:31.718 align:start position:0%
the US Supreme Court for so you got a
 
06:16:34.868 --> 06:16:34.878 align:start position:0%
pending appeal to the US Supreme Court
 
06:16:36.628 --> 06:16:36.638 align:start position:0%
okay so at this point in time it's
 
06:16:38.468 --> 06:16:38.478 align:start position:0%
subtle so if we did pass this this
 
06:16:40.070 --> 06:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have any bearing on your case
 
06:16:43.150 --> 06:16:43.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:46.830 --> 06:16:46.840 align:start position:0%
it um because we cannot make any laws
 
06:16:50.070 --> 06:16:50.080 align:start position:0%
retrospective exp the whole laws not
 
06:16:51.270 --> 06:16:51.280 align:start position:0%
permitted to the New Hampshire
 
06:16:54.468 --> 06:16:54.478 align:start position:0%
Constitution so as such let's move on
 
06:16:55.830 --> 06:16:55.840 align:start position:0%
with your presentation because this is
 
06:17:05.910 --> 06:17:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:14.750 --> 06:17:14.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:17.510 --> 06:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
uh respectfully sir it may be be in the
 
06:17:21.030 --> 06:17:21.040 align:start position:0%
real VI but one of the representatives
 
06:17:23.190 --> 06:17:23.200 align:start position:0%
over here asked if there are specific
 
06:17:25.670 --> 06:17:25.680 align:start position:0%
cases and there are more than
 
06:17:29.190 --> 06:17:29.200 align:start position:0%
mine uh I would refer you
 
06:17:31.868 --> 06:17:31.878 align:start position:0%
to that question was directed to a
 
06:17:33.708 --> 06:17:33.718 align:start position:0%
previous witness so it's the questions
 
06:17:35.350 --> 06:17:35.360 align:start position:0%
that are directed to yourself Mr Albert
 
06:17:38.310 --> 06:17:38.320 align:start position:0%
thank you okay but I believe that issue
 
06:17:40.110 --> 06:17:40.120 align:start position:0%
was properly before the committee
 
06:17:42.590 --> 06:17:42.600 align:start position:0%
whether there are specific cases if you
 
06:17:45.830 --> 06:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
look at exhibit nine you'll see the nine
 
06:17:48.468 --> 06:17:48.478 align:start position:0%
cases uh I gave you a
 
06:17:52.590 --> 06:17:52.600 align:start position:0%
list uh so you guys go through that uh
 
06:17:53.910 --> 06:17:53.920 align:start position:0%
as a case
 
06:17:56.030 --> 06:17:56.040 align:start position:0%
study uh you have the complete
 
06:17:58.670 --> 06:17:58.680 align:start position:0%
deposition of Miss incasso discussing
 
06:18:01.190 --> 06:18:01.200 align:start position:0%
those cases so you can go that through
 
06:18:04.270 --> 06:18:04.280 align:start position:0%
that for a case study on what the
 
06:18:08.388 --> 06:18:08.398 align:start position:0%
potential is and coming back to the bill
 
06:18:13.708 --> 06:18:13.718 align:start position:0%
itself and to address some uh comments
 
06:18:15.150 --> 06:18:15.160 align:start position:0%
by the
 
06:18:15.160 --> 06:18:16.948 align:start position:0%
by the
sponsor

06:18:16.948 --> 06:18:16.958 align:start position:0%
sponsor
 
06:18:22.030 --> 06:18:22.040 align:start position:0%
um apparently this is about public
 
06:18:24.590 --> 06:18:24.600 align:start position:0%
perception um I
 
06:18:28.830 --> 06:18:28.840 align:start position:0%
respectfully disagree on uh the whole
 
06:18:31.708 --> 06:18:31.718 align:start position:0%
need to prove a causal
 
06:18:34.310 --> 06:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
connection uh that's inconsistent with
 
06:18:37.628 --> 06:18:37.638 align:start position:0%
US Supreme Court president and ripo V
 
06:18:40.990 --> 06:18:41.000 align:start position:0%
Baker which chastised the new excuse me
 
06:18:43.830 --> 06:18:43.840 align:start position:0%
the Nevada Supreme Court for applying
 
06:18:46.430 --> 06:18:46.440 align:start position:0%
the wrong legal standard the legal
 
06:18:48.548 --> 06:18:48.558 align:start position:0%
standard is not some kind of proof of
 
06:18:51.788 --> 06:18:51.798 align:start position:0%
bias the legal standard per current US
 
06:18:54.468 --> 06:18:54.478 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court is risk of
 
06:18:57.468 --> 06:18:57.478 align:start position:0%
bias and the
 
06:19:01.110 --> 06:19:01.120 align:start position:0%
issue so first of all this bill is
 
06:19:04.788 --> 06:19:04.798 align:start position:0%
repugnant to article 8 in terms of
 
06:19:06.750 --> 06:19:06.760 align:start position:0%
accountability of magistrates and
 
06:19:09.110 --> 06:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
officers it it's just repugnant to the
 
06:19:11.150 --> 06:19:11.160 align:start position:0%
Constitution it doesn't hold the right
 
06:19:11.160 --> 06:19:12.590 align:start position:0%
Constitution it doesn't hold the right
people

06:19:12.590 --> 06:19:12.600 align:start position:0%
people
 
06:19:18.430 --> 06:19:18.440 align:start position:0%
accountable um with regard to the nine
 
06:19:21.190 --> 06:19:21.200 align:start position:0%
cases you have before me
 
06:19:23.430 --> 06:19:23.440 align:start position:0%
I would assert it's also utterly
 
06:19:27.708 --> 06:19:27.718 align:start position:0%
repugnant to article 10 of the State
 
06:19:31.230 --> 06:19:31.240 align:start position:0%
Constitution I'd certainly review um
 
06:19:34.270 --> 06:19:34.280 align:start position:0%
suggest everybody review articles 8 and
 
06:19:36.510 --> 06:19:36.520 align:start position:0%
10 including our
 
06:19:39.788 --> 06:19:39.798 align:start position:0%
listeners uh article 10 provides strong
 
06:19:41.708 --> 06:19:41.718 align:start position:0%
protection for equal
 
06:19:44.430 --> 06:19:44.440 align:start position:0%
protection uh our state supreme court
 
06:19:47.430 --> 06:19:47.440 align:start position:0%
has recognized that for over 100 years
 
06:19:52.590 --> 06:19:52.600 align:start position:0%
opinion of the justices 144 and H 374
 
06:19:55.270 --> 06:19:55.280 align:start position:0%
1999 going all the way back to State
 
06:19:55.280 --> 06:19:56.750 align:start position:0%
1999 going all the way back to State
vpoer

06:19:56.750 --> 06:19:56.760 align:start position:0%
vpoer
 
06:19:59.110 --> 06:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
65 uh NH
 
06:19:59.120 --> 06:20:01.430 align:start position:0%
65 uh NH
113

06:20:01.430 --> 06:20:01.440 align:start position:0%
113
 
06:20:06.110 --> 06:20:06.120 align:start position:0%
1889 and because article at 10 provides
 
06:20:08.548 --> 06:20:08.558 align:start position:0%
such strong equal protection or is
 
06:20:11.548 --> 06:20:11.558 align:start position:0%
supposed to what you have here is nine
 
06:20:14.990 --> 06:20:15.000 align:start position:0%
cases a very similarly situated
 
06:20:16.990 --> 06:20:17.000 align:start position:0%
litigants who were treated radically
 
06:20:18.708 --> 06:20:18.718 align:start position:0%
different by the court system you've got
 
06:20:21.270 --> 06:20:21.280 align:start position:0%
selective recusal and sign
 
06:20:23.788 --> 06:20:23.798 align:start position:0%
you've got people not knowing about it
 
06:20:26.510 --> 06:20:26.520 align:start position:0%
for years and other and the way the bill
 
06:20:29.310 --> 06:20:29.320 align:start position:0%
is written it would only provide relief
 
06:20:31.310 --> 06:20:31.320 align:start position:0%
to the person who brought the complaint
 
06:20:35.990 --> 06:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't provide any relief to you
 
06:20:38.230 --> 06:20:38.240 align:start position:0%
know the other nine cases where this
 
06:20:40.948 --> 06:20:40.958 align:start position:0%
specifically went on
 
06:20:40.958 --> 06:20:43.190 align:start position:0%
specifically went on
so

06:20:43.190 --> 06:20:43.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:20:47.270 --> 06:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
um I mean the way this is
 
06:20:50.628 --> 06:20:50.638 align:start position:0%
written I don't see any way any body
 
06:20:53.750 --> 06:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
could in practice ever get any relief
 
06:20:56.230 --> 06:20:56.240 align:start position:0%
from this it kind of brings to mind May
 
06:21:00.310 --> 06:21:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:02.948 --> 06:21:02.958 align:start position:0%
favor are there any questions for this
 
06:21:05.628 --> 06:21:05.638 align:start position:0%
witness representative
 
06:21:07.910 --> 06:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
kutab thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
06:21:11.708 --> 06:21:11.718 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so you have ex
 
06:21:15.110 --> 06:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
you've given us examples of cases where
 
06:21:19.150 --> 06:21:19.160 align:start position:0%
judges have now been or been found uh to
 
06:21:21.628 --> 06:21:21.638 align:start position:0%
have committed miscon conduct however
 
06:21:23.430 --> 06:21:23.440 align:start position:0%
you are opposed to this bill is there a
 
06:21:26.310 --> 06:21:26.320 align:start position:0%
way that the bill could be amended to
 
06:21:28.030 --> 06:21:28.040 align:start position:0%
address the concerns that you have or
 
06:21:30.190 --> 06:21:30.200 align:start position:0%
you just opposed to it in
 
06:21:33.990 --> 06:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
general uh I would amend it to bring
 
06:21:37.830 --> 06:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
back something like the prior RSA
 
06:21:42.270 --> 06:21:42.280 align:start position:0%
494 a uh judicial conduct
 
06:21:44.948 --> 06:21:44.958 align:start position:0%
commission with enough tweaks to make
 
06:21:48.350 --> 06:21:48.360 align:start position:0%
that past constitutional muster so that
 
06:21:51.590 --> 06:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
when we have sort of real
 
06:21:55.350 --> 06:21:55.360 align:start position:0%
cases like we're demonstrating here
 
06:21:57.150 --> 06:21:57.160 align:start position:0%
where there really is a
 
06:22:02.388 --> 06:22:02.398 align:start position:0%
problem uh we have more legislative
 
06:22:05.830 --> 06:22:05.840 align:start position:0%
oversight and more independent oversight
 
06:22:08.750 --> 06:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
that's not under the
 
06:22:12.430 --> 06:22:12.440 align:start position:0%
Judiciary um sort of to quote juvenile
 
06:22:16.430 --> 06:22:16.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:18.350 --> 06:22:18.360 align:start position:0%
Watchers are there any other questions
 
06:22:20.990 --> 06:22:21.000 align:start position:0%
for this a witness
 
06:22:24.468 --> 06:22:24.478 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you thank you for your
 
06:22:26.430 --> 06:22:26.440 align:start position:0%
consideration uh committee now calls
 
06:22:28.270 --> 06:22:28.280 align:start position:0%
Randall s
 
06:22:39.868 --> 06:22:39.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:42.270 --> 06:22:42.280 align:start position:0%
himself good afternoon committee um
 
06:22:43.788 --> 06:22:43.798 align:start position:0%
thank you for letting me speak today I
 
06:22:48.230 --> 06:22:48.240 align:start position:0%
oppose uh the commission's bill um there
 
06:22:50.910 --> 06:22:50.920 align:start position:0%
obviously some word needs to be fixed
 
06:22:54.948 --> 06:22:54.958 align:start position:0%
with it um originally it says in the 60s
 
06:22:56.670 --> 06:22:56.680 align:start position:0%
that uh the judicial conduct commission
 
06:22:58.548 --> 06:22:58.558 align:start position:0%
was uh organized to investigate
 
06:22:59.910 --> 06:22:59.920 align:start position:0%
prosecute and adjudicate complaints
 
06:23:01.590 --> 06:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
about judicial
 
06:23:05.110 --> 06:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
misconduct um I believe was it in two
 
06:23:07.788 --> 06:23:07.798 align:start position:0%
2001 that the Supreme Court said that
 
06:23:09.070 --> 06:23:09.080 align:start position:0%
the commission was
 
06:23:11.230 --> 06:23:11.240 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional um and I'm just kind of
 
06:23:14.548 --> 06:23:14.558 align:start position:0%
curious I'm confused and and regards the
 
06:23:18.110 --> 06:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
committee and the and the commission um
 
06:23:20.308 --> 06:23:20.318 align:start position:0%
we filed grievances with the Comm with
 
06:23:21.948 --> 06:23:21.958 align:start position:0%
the judicial conduct committee uh and
 
06:23:22.948 --> 06:23:22.958 align:start position:0%
they were all
 
06:23:26.110 --> 06:23:26.120 align:start position:0%
denied um but I have some questions for
 
06:23:27.230 --> 06:23:27.240 align:start position:0%
the for the committee if the Circuit
 
06:23:29.110 --> 06:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
Court was made by legislation that is
 
06:23:30.788 --> 06:23:30.798 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional there's a good chance
 
06:23:32.868 --> 06:23:32.878 align:start position:0%
the committee uh that was formed in the
 
06:23:34.350 --> 06:23:34.360 align:start position:0%
60s was right that the commission is
 
06:23:35.868 --> 06:23:35.878 align:start position:0%
also un
 
06:23:39.030 --> 06:23:39.040 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional um what was the Supreme
 
06:23:40.548 --> 06:23:40.558 align:start position:0%
Court's reasons that the commission was
 
06:23:42.628 --> 06:23:42.638 align:start position:0%
found unconstitutional is the same
 
06:23:44.868 --> 06:23:44.878 align:start position:0%
reasons that the Circuit Court was found
 
06:23:47.510 --> 06:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional uh this also means that
 
06:23:48.750 --> 06:23:48.760 align:start position:0%
uh circuit Court's obviously an
 
06:23:51.230 --> 06:23:51.240 align:start position:0%
administrative Court um and they violate
 
06:23:52.788 --> 06:23:52.798 align:start position:0%
our rights through
 
06:23:55.788 --> 06:23:55.798 align:start position:0%
173b um but however we all know that uh
 
06:23:57.270 --> 06:23:57.280 align:start position:0%
circuit courts an administrative Court
 
06:23:58.868 --> 06:23:58.878 align:start position:0%
not a constitutional court so they
 
06:24:01.308 --> 06:24:01.318 align:start position:0%
violate all our rights anyway um but we
 
06:24:03.708 --> 06:24:03.718 align:start position:0%
do need checks and balances throughout a
 
06:24:06.110 --> 06:24:06.120 align:start position:0%
independent commission um we need checks
 
06:24:06.120 --> 06:24:06.788 align:start position:0%
independent commission um we need checks
and

06:24:06.788 --> 06:24:06.798 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:24:10.110 --> 06:24:10.120 align:start position:0%
balances um and I don't know how to to
 
06:24:14.230 --> 06:24:14.240 align:start position:0%
reword it but we we do need um checks
 
06:24:16.750 --> 06:24:16.760 align:start position:0%
and balances on on all branches of
 
06:24:19.590 --> 06:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
government um I have a lot here to say
 
06:24:21.670 --> 06:24:21.680 align:start position:0%
but it's probably too much for everybody
 
06:24:24.708 --> 06:24:24.718 align:start position:0%
so uh any
 
06:24:27.510 --> 06:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
06:24:31.350 --> 06:24:31.360 align:start position:0%
gon this may be a question that someone
 
06:24:32.868 --> 06:24:32.878 align:start position:0%
else can
 
06:24:35.430 --> 06:24:35.440 align:start position:0%
answer but I wonder if there's a little
 
06:24:38.030 --> 06:24:38.040 align:start position:0%
confusion about what this bill or maybe
 
06:24:40.388 --> 06:24:40.398 align:start position:0%
I'm the one who's confused this
 
06:24:44.468 --> 06:24:44.478 align:start position:0%
time this bill appears to me to
 
06:24:49.590 --> 06:24:49.600 align:start position:0%
say a judge has been found to have some
 
06:24:51.150 --> 06:24:51.160 align:start position:0%
sort of of
 
06:24:54.948 --> 06:24:54.958 align:start position:0%
misconduct by the judicial
 
06:24:54.958 --> 06:24:57.030 align:start position:0%
misconduct by the judicial
misconduct

06:24:57.030 --> 06:24:57.040 align:start position:0%
misconduct
 
06:25:01.590 --> 06:25:01.600 align:start position:0%
whatever now if you had you have had a
 
06:25:05.190 --> 06:25:05.200 align:start position:0%
case before that judge and you believe
 
06:25:07.868 --> 06:25:07.878 align:start position:0%
that that judge's misconduct affected
 
06:25:07.878 --> 06:25:09.308 align:start position:0%
that that judge's misconduct affected
the

06:25:09.308 --> 06:25:09.318 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:25:12.350 --> 06:25:12.360 align:start position:0%
ruling you can now petition the court to
 
06:25:14.830 --> 06:25:14.840 align:start position:0%
have your case reviewed so this isn't
 
06:25:17.990 --> 06:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
about bringing a complaint against the
 
06:25:20.468 --> 06:25:20.478 align:start position:0%
judge it's about getting getting your
 
06:25:20.478 --> 06:25:21.510 align:start position:0%
judge it's about getting getting your
case

06:25:21.510 --> 06:25:21.520 align:start position:0%
case
 
06:25:24.548 --> 06:25:24.558 align:start position:0%
reviewed and as it pertains to perhaps
 
06:25:27.110 --> 06:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
if the problem is the administrative
 
06:25:30.190 --> 06:25:30.200 align:start position:0%
judge the remedy is in lines 20 through
 
06:25:32.750 --> 06:25:32.760 align:start position:0%
22 that says that you would then if if
 
06:25:34.150 --> 06:25:34.160 align:start position:0%
that's who the problem is you would go
 
06:25:36.510 --> 06:25:36.520 align:start position:0%
to the most senior associate judge of
 
06:25:39.510 --> 06:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
the court in question so if that's the
 
06:25:41.910 --> 06:25:41.920 align:start position:0%
problem you go you you jump the chain of
 
06:25:43.750 --> 06:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
command to the next highest one or
 
06:25:43.760 --> 06:25:46.388 align:start position:0%
command to the next highest one or
whatever

06:25:46.388 --> 06:25:46.398 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
06:25:49.628 --> 06:25:49.638 align:start position:0%
so am I am I reading the bill correctly
 
06:25:51.308 --> 06:25:51.318 align:start position:0%
that that's what this bill does and do
 
06:25:53.830 --> 06:25:53.840 align:start position:0%
you understand that that's what this
 
06:25:56.308 --> 06:25:56.318 align:start position:0%
bill is doing not about your claim
 
06:25:57.670 --> 06:25:57.680 align:start position:0%
against the judge and and trying to
 
06:25:59.430 --> 06:25:59.440 align:start position:0%
initiate some sort of action against the
 
06:26:01.910 --> 06:26:01.920 align:start position:0%
judge but rather to have your particular
 
06:26:05.468 --> 06:26:05.478 align:start position:0%
case that that judge heard reheard or
 
06:26:08.430 --> 06:26:08.440 align:start position:0%
reopened in some way yeah but there's a
 
06:26:11.590 --> 06:26:11.600 align:start position:0%
lot of other uh like back doors that
 
06:26:14.270 --> 06:26:14.280 align:start position:0%
need to be checked before that happens
 
06:26:15.948 --> 06:26:15.958 align:start position:0%
um and we're trying to get through that
 
06:26:19.308 --> 06:26:19.318 align:start position:0%
through all these other bills but if
 
06:26:22.388 --> 06:26:22.398 align:start position:0%
administr Court Circuit Court rule 2.2
 
06:26:26.190 --> 06:26:26.200 align:start position:0%
says um Rules of Evidence don't apply in
 
06:26:28.350 --> 06:26:28.360 align:start position:0%
domestic violence or or family cases
 
06:26:29.868 --> 06:26:29.878 align:start position:0%
because it's an administrative Court
 
06:26:32.350 --> 06:26:32.360 align:start position:0%
Article 15 is rights of the accused
 
06:26:34.230 --> 06:26:34.240 align:start position:0%
right judicial mission mission conduct
 
06:26:36.308 --> 06:26:36.318 align:start position:0%
or mission statement is the follow the
 
06:26:39.150 --> 06:26:39.160 align:start position:0%
Constitution so every single
 
06:26:42.430 --> 06:26:42.440 align:start position:0%
administrative hearing is completely
 
06:26:45.548 --> 06:26:45.558 align:start position:0%
violating all of all the citizens rights
 
06:26:48.388 --> 06:26:48.398 align:start position:0%
so the judicial conduct committee knows
 
06:26:49.750 --> 06:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
this because it's not a con
 
06:26:52.270 --> 06:26:52.280 align:start position:0%
constitutional court but we we need a
 
06:26:54.910 --> 06:26:54.920 align:start position:0%
remedy because every time that we go
 
06:26:57.590 --> 06:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
looking for a remedy it's always backed
 
06:27:01.388 --> 06:27:01.398 align:start position:0%
and it's always denied so we we
 
06:27:04.868 --> 06:27:04.878 align:start position:0%
need a body separate leg well I don't
 
06:27:07.910 --> 06:27:07.920 align:start position:0%
know including the Judiciary but for
 
06:27:07.920 --> 06:27:09.590 align:start position:0%
know including the Judiciary but for
oversight

06:27:09.590 --> 06:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
oversight
 
06:27:12.670 --> 06:27:12.680 align:start position:0%
because they continuously violate our
 
06:27:15.308 --> 06:27:15.318 align:start position:0%
rights but then when we go for redress
 
06:27:16.990 --> 06:27:17.000 align:start position:0%
because the redress committee's gone too
 
06:27:20.070 --> 06:27:20.080 align:start position:0%
now part of the First Amendment um we
 
06:27:21.308 --> 06:27:21.318 align:start position:0%
have nowhere to
 
06:27:23.910 --> 06:27:23.920 align:start position:0%
turn so I I understand what you're
 
06:27:25.190 --> 06:27:25.200 align:start position:0%
saying but go
 
06:27:28.830 --> 06:27:28.840 align:start position:0%
ahead follow I I I I don't think that
 
06:27:30.590 --> 06:27:30.600 align:start position:0%
this bill actually addresses that
 
06:27:32.830 --> 06:27:32.840 align:start position:0%
problem it's not intended to I know
 
06:27:34.388 --> 06:27:34.398 align:start position:0%
there's another bill somewhere at least
 
06:27:37.430 --> 06:27:37.440 align:start position:0%
I maybe dreamed it one night but uh
 
06:27:39.110 --> 06:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
there there is other legislation that
 
06:27:41.548 --> 06:27:41.558 align:start position:0%
may address your that issue but that's
 
06:27:47.750 --> 06:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:50.788 --> 06:27:50.798 align:start position:0%
mistaken any other questions for the
 
06:27:54.350 --> 06:27:54.360 align:start position:0%
wit article 14 and Article 15 to I mean
 
06:27:56.190 --> 06:27:56.200 align:start position:0%
it's the rights of the people so we we
 
06:28:00.350 --> 06:28:00.360 align:start position:0%
need to have something in place
 
06:28:04.788 --> 06:28:04.798 align:start position:0%
so questions okay saying none uh Anthony
 
06:28:04.798 --> 06:28:09.430 align:start position:0%
so questions okay saying none uh Anthony
Kenny

06:28:09.430 --> 06:28:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:12.430 --> 06:28:12.440 align:start position:0%
please that is the last one thank you
 
06:28:14.548 --> 06:28:14.558 align:start position:0%
representatives of the committee for
 
06:28:16.990 --> 06:28:17.000 align:start position:0%
letting me speak today I'm here to
 
06:28:18.430 --> 06:28:18.440 align:start position:0%
oppose HB
 
06:28:20.350 --> 06:28:20.360 align:start position:0%
1104 uh
 
06:28:23.990 --> 06:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
in cases where uh well every judge
 
06:28:25.948 --> 06:28:25.958 align:start position:0%
swears an oath uh to support both the
 
06:28:27.868 --> 06:28:27.878 align:start position:0%
state and federal constitutions and to
 
06:28:29.190 --> 06:28:29.200 align:start position:0%
be faithful and
 
06:28:29.200 --> 06:28:30.830 align:start position:0%
be faithful and
impartial

06:28:30.830 --> 06:28:30.840 align:start position:0%
impartial
 
06:28:34.308 --> 06:28:34.318 align:start position:0%
uh but the judge showing uh a knowing
 
06:28:34.318 --> 06:28:35.070 align:start position:0%
uh but the judge showing uh a knowing
and

06:28:35.070 --> 06:28:35.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:28:38.708 --> 06:28:38.718 align:start position:0%
willingly uh showing partiality in
 
06:28:40.868 --> 06:28:40.878 align:start position:0%
favoritism or bias poor
 
06:28:43.548 --> 06:28:43.558 align:start position:0%
decision-making uh due to a known or
 
06:28:47.510 --> 06:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
many known conflicts of interest uh
 
06:28:50.030 --> 06:28:50.040 align:start position:0%
intentional violation of Rights to good
 
06:28:52.388 --> 06:28:52.398 align:start position:0%
parents and innocent children in cases
 
06:28:55.150 --> 06:28:55.160 align:start position:0%
where these violations by the
 
06:28:58.910 --> 06:28:58.920 align:start position:0%
judges uh also violate their oath of
 
06:29:01.270 --> 06:29:01.280 align:start position:0%
office they harm families keeping
 
06:29:03.548 --> 06:29:03.558 align:start position:0%
parents from seeing their children uh
 
06:29:05.110 --> 06:29:05.120 align:start position:0%
keeping innocent children from seeing
 
06:29:08.150 --> 06:29:08.160 align:start position:0%
their parents the system is already
 
06:29:10.230 --> 06:29:10.240 align:start position:0%
broken uh and it makes it near
 
06:29:12.670 --> 06:29:12.680 align:start position:0%
impossible for any late to seek Justice
 
06:29:16.110 --> 06:29:16.120 align:start position:0%
for their losses family or children uh
 
06:29:17.708 --> 06:29:17.718 align:start position:0%
it seems like the way the law is set up
 
06:29:19.750 --> 06:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
right now uh there is a way to get a
 
06:29:21.430 --> 06:29:21.440 align:start position:0%
remedy makes it hard to go through the
 
06:29:23.548 --> 06:29:23.558 align:start position:0%
judicial conduct committee uh when you
 
06:29:25.990 --> 06:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
make a complaint as you've already heard
 
06:29:29.628 --> 06:29:29.638 align:start position:0%
today um it's not if the administrative
 
06:29:32.190 --> 06:29:32.200 align:start position:0%
judge is the problem then it goes to a
 
06:29:34.388 --> 06:29:34.398 align:start position:0%
different judge I think what the meaning
 
06:29:36.868 --> 06:29:36.878 align:start position:0%
was is if there's a problem with any
 
06:29:39.230 --> 06:29:39.240 align:start position:0%
judge it goes to the administrative
 
06:29:42.910 --> 06:29:42.920 align:start position:0%
judge who covers it up that's the issue
 
06:29:46.270 --> 06:29:46.280 align:start position:0%
okay so uh
 
06:29:49.788 --> 06:29:49.798 align:start position:0%
1104 just adds to the problem because
 
06:29:52.030 --> 06:29:52.040 align:start position:0%
now you have to go through the channel
 
06:29:53.110 --> 06:29:53.120 align:start position:0%
you have
 
06:29:56.230 --> 06:29:56.240 align:start position:0%
to it says all of these considerations
 
06:29:58.510 --> 06:29:58.520 align:start position:0%
must be met well what if all of those
 
06:30:00.190 --> 06:30:00.200 align:start position:0%
considerations are not there in your
 
06:30:02.468 --> 06:30:02.478 align:start position:0%
complaint what if it's you know oh the
 
06:30:04.468 --> 06:30:04.478 align:start position:0%
judge has a relationship with a
 
06:30:06.990 --> 06:30:07.000 align:start position:0%
co-parent attorney uh and refuses to
 
06:30:10.270 --> 06:30:10.280 align:start position:0%
recuse himself and making bad decisions
 
06:30:13.670 --> 06:30:13.680 align:start position:0%
uh leaving your child either without
 
06:30:18.230 --> 06:30:18.240 align:start position:0%
parent or or living with their abuser
 
06:30:23.110 --> 06:30:23.120 align:start position:0%
uh so so uh this bill is just another
 
06:30:25.708 --> 06:30:25.718 align:start position:0%
act uh for judicial Mis conduct to get
 
06:30:28.628 --> 06:30:28.638 align:start position:0%
pushed under the rug uh as far as formal
 
06:30:30.910 --> 06:30:30.920 align:start position:0%
discipline the law was already set when
 
06:30:31.788 --> 06:30:31.798 align:start position:0%
it was
 
06:30:35.788 --> 06:30:35.798 align:start position:0%
changed uh uh in in in it uh and just
 
06:30:38.830 --> 06:30:38.840 align:start position:0%
touch on uh uh alyn when he said that uh
 
06:30:41.430 --> 06:30:41.440 align:start position:0%
the finding of judicial conduct is rare
 
06:30:45.270 --> 06:30:45.280 align:start position:0%
or very rare that's again the issue it's
 
06:30:48.230 --> 06:30:48.240 align:start position:0%
very rare to find by the judicial
 
06:30:49.708 --> 06:30:49.718 align:start position:0%
conduct committee or go going through
 
06:30:51.948 --> 06:30:51.958 align:start position:0%
the administrative judge but it's not
 
06:30:53.670 --> 06:30:53.680 align:start position:0%
very rare that there's a complaint
 
06:30:55.788 --> 06:30:55.798 align:start position:0%
because the judicial conduct committee
 
06:30:58.910 --> 06:30:58.920 align:start position:0%
acts like each individual complaint is a
 
06:31:01.468 --> 06:31:01.478 align:start position:0%
new complaint on a different judge when
 
06:31:03.548 --> 06:31:03.558 align:start position:0%
they're compiling many many complaints
 
06:31:05.110 --> 06:31:05.120 align:start position:0%
on the same judge that shows a pattern
 
06:31:07.110 --> 06:31:07.120 align:start position:0%
of behavior when all prosade litigants
 
06:31:08.910 --> 06:31:08.920 align:start position:0%
are in there saying the very same thing
 
06:31:10.990 --> 06:31:11.000 align:start position:0%
about the very same
 
06:31:15.308 --> 06:31:15.318 align:start position:0%
judge so I asked the Senate to oppose HB
 
06:31:18.350 --> 06:31:18.360 align:start position:0%
1104 and request that the Senate also
 
06:31:21.350 --> 06:31:21.360 align:start position:0%
oppose the passing of
 
06:31:24.750 --> 06:31:24.760 align:start position:0%
104 I further ask that the Senate amend
 
06:31:27.150 --> 06:31:27.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire RSC
 
06:31:32.270 --> 06:31:32.280 align:start position:0%

name is Lisa Schmidt and I support this
 
06:33:47.350 --> 06:33:47.360 align:start position:0%
bill my husband Jack was a vibrant
 
06:33:52.150 --> 06:33:52.160 align:start position:0%
active 82y old still kaying hiking and
 
06:33:54.590 --> 06:33:54.600 align:start position:0%
splitting and stacking six cores of
 
06:33:58.230 --> 06:33:58.240 align:start position:0%
firewood in August 2022 when he was 83
 
06:34:00.030 --> 06:34:00.040 align:start position:0%
he was diagnosed with stage four
 
06:34:02.788 --> 06:34:02.798 align:start position:0%
prostate cancer he started hormone
 
06:34:05.270 --> 06:34:05.280 align:start position:0%
treatments and he had some benefits from
 
06:34:07.788 --> 06:34:07.798 align:start position:0%
that uh but then the nausea pain
 
06:34:09.750 --> 06:34:09.760 align:start position:0%
constipation and weakness increased he
 
06:34:11.868 --> 06:34:11.878 align:start position:0%
went from a cane to Walker to wheelchair
 
06:34:15.110 --> 06:34:15.120 align:start position:0%
in a few months he chose Hospice in
 
06:34:18.150 --> 06:34:18.160 align:start position:0%
April of this last year hospice was
 
06:34:21.308 --> 06:34:21.318 align:start position:0%
amazing but he even so he experienced
 
06:34:23.990 --> 06:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
breakthrough pain and his constipation
 
06:34:24.000 --> 06:34:24.910 align:start position:0%
breakthrough pain and his constipation
got

06:34:24.910 --> 06:34:24.920 align:start position:0%
got
 
06:34:27.388 --> 06:34:27.398 align:start position:0%
worse he had always wanted to make use
 
06:34:30.150 --> 06:34:30.160 align:start position:0%
of Medical Aid and dying and he wanted
 
06:34:31.750 --> 06:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
us to go to Vermont where it was legal
 
06:34:34.468 --> 06:34:34.478 align:start position:0%
for out of-state residence but it is
 
06:34:36.830 --> 06:34:36.840 align:start position:0%
nearly impossible for a terminally ill
 
06:34:39.990 --> 06:34:40.000 align:start position:0%
person to Access Medical Aid and dying
 
06:34:43.150 --> 06:34:43.160 align:start position:0%
in Vermont at that point so it was not
 
06:34:45.510 --> 06:34:45.520 align:start position:0%
an option for us he talked about ending
 
06:34:47.990 --> 06:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
his life and he wanted me to purchase a
 
06:34:48.000 --> 06:34:49.830 align:start position:0%
his life and he wanted me to purchase a
pistol

06:34:49.830 --> 06:34:49.840 align:start position:0%
pistol
 
06:34:52.110 --> 06:34:52.120 align:start position:0%
in August he was unable to get out of
 
06:34:55.590 --> 06:34:55.600 align:start position:0%
bed even with a Hoyer lift the the only
 
06:34:58.868 --> 06:34:58.878 align:start position:0%
way to help him evacuate his bowels was
 
06:35:00.868 --> 06:35:00.878 align:start position:0%
with multiple enemas and me wearing
 
06:35:05.990 --> 06:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
gloves and helping draw out the the
 
06:35:10.190 --> 06:35:10.200 align:start position:0%
poop a manual assist in
 
06:35:13.070 --> 06:35:13.080 align:start position:0%
September in order to control his dying
 
06:35:15.868 --> 06:35:15.878 align:start position:0%
he chose to stop eating and
 
06:35:17.990 --> 06:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
drinking he stopped eating and drinking
 
06:35:20.388 --> 06:35:20.398 align:start position:0%
on September 4th and died eight days
 
06:35:23.110 --> 06:35:23.120 align:start position:0%
later helping my husband navigate his
 
06:35:25.590 --> 06:35:25.600 align:start position:0%
final 12 months of his life was a
 
06:35:28.868 --> 06:35:28.878 align:start position:0%
journey and a gift but nothing was to be
 
06:35:31.388 --> 06:35:31.398 align:start position:0%
gained by forcing him to live beyond his
 
06:35:31.398 --> 06:35:32.590 align:start position:0%
gained by forcing him to live beyond his
meaningful

06:35:32.590 --> 06:35:32.600 align:start position:0%
meaningful
 
06:35:35.590 --> 06:35:35.600 align:start position:0%
life and with so much
 
06:35:38.270 --> 06:35:38.280 align:start position:0%
suffering he wanted me to do whatever I
 
06:35:40.548 --> 06:35:40.558 align:start position:0%
could to make Medical Aid and dying
 
06:35:44.388 --> 06:35:44.398 align:start position:0%

for the two-minute limit I'm winging it
 
06:36:36.948 --> 06:36:36.958 align:start position:0%
I submitted my testimony and I just want
 
06:36:38.548 --> 06:36:38.558 align:start position:0%
to say I've been a registered nurse for
 
06:36:41.350 --> 06:36:41.360 align:start position:0%
40 years I worked in catastrophic case
 
06:36:44.350 --> 06:36:44.360 align:start position:0%
management and oncology so a short story
 
06:36:45.948 --> 06:36:45.958 align:start position:0%
is I just managed their care from
 
06:36:47.788 --> 06:36:47.798 align:start position:0%
beginning to the end whether it be
 
06:36:49.708 --> 06:36:49.718 align:start position:0%
recovery or end of life
 
06:36:51.388 --> 06:36:51.398 align:start position:0%
I currently work in hospice and have
 
06:36:54.190 --> 06:36:54.200 align:start position:0%
worked in hospice for a long time now
 
06:36:55.830 --> 06:36:55.840 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to switch over to my own
 
06:36:58.510 --> 06:36:58.520 align:start position:0%
personal experience I've taken care of
 
06:37:00.868 --> 06:37:00.878 align:start position:0%
lots of people I'm done so many stories
 
06:37:04.548 --> 06:37:04.558 align:start position:0%
good bad and all that um I was diagnosed
 
06:37:07.150 --> 06:37:07.160 align:start position:0%
I moved up from conquer to millsfield in
 
06:37:10.510 --> 06:37:10.520 align:start position:0%
2011 and got diagnosed with cancer not a
 
06:37:12.468 --> 06:37:12.478 align:start position:0%
lot of care up there being the case
 
06:37:14.750 --> 06:37:14.760 align:start position:0%
manager I had to case manage myself and
 
06:37:16.788 --> 06:37:16.798 align:start position:0%
I went everywhere to get my treatment so
 
06:37:20.868 --> 06:37:20.878 align:start position:0%
I had surgery I had chemo and radiation
 
06:37:24.830 --> 06:37:24.840 align:start position:0%
everywhere and my tumor is um a very
 
06:37:26.948 --> 06:37:26.958 align:start position:0%
aggressive a tumor and it's
 
06:37:30.468 --> 06:37:30.478 align:start position:0%
um uh it's got a saroma component and as
 
06:37:32.788 --> 06:37:32.798 align:start position:0%
a hospice nurse I know how badly that
 
06:37:36.468 --> 06:37:36.478 align:start position:0%
can end and so I love my life and I'm
 
06:37:39.868 --> 06:37:39.878 align:start position:0%
doing well uh since then but I want the
 
06:37:41.948 --> 06:37:41.958 align:start position:0%
option I believe in this bill because I
 
06:37:44.110 --> 06:37:44.120 align:start position:0%
want the option to have that should my
 
06:37:46.830 --> 06:37:46.840 align:start position:0%
cancer invade my body in a way that I
 
06:37:49.230 --> 06:37:49.240 align:start position:0%
don't think hospice can manage
 
06:37:50.990 --> 06:37:51.000 align:start position:0%
and I really truly believe that we
 
06:37:53.070 --> 06:37:53.080 align:start position:0%
should have the choice just having the
 
06:37:56.030 --> 06:37:56.040 align:start position:0%
choice alone will take away the anxiety
 
06:37:59.110 --> 06:37:59.120 align:start position:0%
I would have knowing how I would may die
 
06:38:01.670 --> 06:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
may not I may not need it but I like I'd
 
06:38:04.230 --> 06:38:04.240 align:start position:0%
like to know I could if I needed it so
 
06:38:06.350 --> 06:38:06.360 align:start position:0%

years who begged for me to end their
 
06:39:53.388 --> 06:39:53.398 align:start position:0%
life it wasn't all of
 
06:39:57.750 --> 06:39:57.760 align:start position:0%
them um and one of my first experiences
 
06:40:00.468 --> 06:40:00.478 align:start position:0%
was a husband of this woman that I took
 
06:40:03.270 --> 06:40:03.280 align:start position:0%
care of after he died he went to his
 
06:40:05.070 --> 06:40:05.080 align:start position:0%
truck and he put a gun to his head and I
 
06:40:07.708 --> 06:40:07.718 align:start position:0%
had to go out and pronounce him and it
 
06:40:12.388 --> 06:40:12.398 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:15.948 --> 06:40:15.958 align:start position:0%
deal uh I think that my experience has
 
06:40:17.830 --> 06:40:17.840 align:start position:0%
convinced me that for some patients the
 
06:40:19.468 --> 06:40:19.478 align:start position:0%
most humane and
 
06:40:22.670 --> 06:40:22.680 align:start position:0%
compassionate care we would be yeah
 
06:40:24.830 --> 06:40:24.840 align:start position:0%
sorry would be to allow them the option
 
06:40:27.868 --> 06:40:27.878 align:start position:0%
of deciding to end their own suffering
 
06:40:30.030 --> 06:40:30.040 align:start position:0%
in hospice you've got psychiatric
 
06:40:33.070 --> 06:40:33.080 align:start position:0%
evaluation counseling anti-depressants
 
06:40:36.350 --> 06:40:36.360 align:start position:0%
anti-anxiety meds pain meds and
 
06:40:39.308 --> 06:40:39.318 align:start position:0%
spiritual care if they accept it those
 
06:40:41.070 --> 06:40:41.080 align:start position:0%
are all used to help with both the
 
06:40:43.868 --> 06:40:43.878 align:start position:0%
emotional and physical pain but
 
06:40:47.430 --> 06:40:47.440 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's just not
 
06:40:47.440 --> 06:40:50.190 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's just not
enough

06:40:50.190 --> 06:40:50.200 align:start position:0%
enough
 
06:40:53.670 --> 06:40:53.680 align:start position:0%
death and I and I would like to say um
 
06:40:56.308 --> 06:40:56.318 align:start position:0%
is that suicide euthanasia the words
 
06:40:59.150 --> 06:40:59.160 align:start position:0%
that I'm using I'm hearing here today
 
06:41:02.468 --> 06:41:02.478 align:start position:0%
should not be included in this this is
 
06:41:02.478 --> 06:41:03.628 align:start position:0%
should not be included in this this is
not

06:41:03.628 --> 06:41:03.638 align:start position:0%
not
 
06:41:07.510 --> 06:41:07.520 align:start position:0%
suicide this is death of the patient who
 
06:41:09.910 --> 06:41:09.920 align:start position:0%
their goal has not been met to be
 
06:41:12.150 --> 06:41:12.160 align:start position:0%
comfortable we have somehow let them
 
06:41:15.270 --> 06:41:15.280 align:start position:0%
down the goal is to manage intractable
 
06:41:17.990 --> 06:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
suffering caused from not only the pain
 
06:41:20.628 --> 06:41:20.638 align:start position:0%
but that of of emotional and existential
 
06:41:22.948 --> 06:41:22.958 align:start position:0%
suffering many have embraced and
 
06:41:25.990 --> 06:41:26.000 align:start position:0%
accepted the dying process but hospice
 
06:41:28.430 --> 06:41:28.440 align:start position:0%
and end of life care doesn't always get
 
06:41:32.628 --> 06:41:32.638 align:start position:0%
it right so that's why I'm here today is
 
06:41:35.468 --> 06:41:35.478 align:start position:0%
to understand that sometimes we just
 
06:41:38.150 --> 06:41:38.160 align:start position:0%
don't do it and people need to have that
 
06:41:41.830 --> 06:41:41.840 align:start position:0%
right thank you questions for this
 
06:41:46.548 --> 06:41:46.558 align:start position:0%

Advocates so um I am also the mother of
 
06:42:38.750 --> 06:42:38.760 align:start position:0%
a physically disabled daughter and it's
 
06:42:40.830 --> 06:42:40.840 align:start position:0%
important that we protect the people
 
06:42:43.110 --> 06:42:43.120 align:start position:0%
with disabilities in New Hampshire
 
06:42:45.070 --> 06:42:45.080 align:start position:0%
therefore when we were doing our
 
06:42:47.670 --> 06:42:47.680 align:start position:0%
researches we extended invitations and
 
06:42:49.670 --> 06:42:49.680 align:start position:0%
open discussion s focusing on any
 
06:42:52.190 --> 06:42:52.200 align:start position:0%
concerns or language changes that might
 
06:42:54.948 --> 06:42:54.958 align:start position:0%
be needed from our Disability Advocates
 
06:42:57.670 --> 06:42:57.680 align:start position:0%
to feel comfortable with this bill we
 
06:43:00.110 --> 06:43:00.120 align:start position:0%
consulted with people from all over the
 
06:43:05.030 --> 06:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
country excuse me um so
 
06:43:09.030 --> 06:43:09.040 align:start position:0%
sorry we I'm so sorry we we consulted
 
06:43:11.308 --> 06:43:11.318 align:start position:0%
with people all over the country the
 
06:43:13.510 --> 06:43:13.520 align:start position:0%
policy director of disability rights
 
06:43:15.948 --> 06:43:15.958 align:start position:0%
Center in Oregon told us that none of
 
06:43:17.948 --> 06:43:17.958 align:start position:0%
the fears have been realized and they
 
06:43:19.308 --> 06:43:19.318 align:start position:0%
believe believe that people living with
 
06:43:21.468 --> 06:43:21.478 align:start position:0%
disabilities who qualify for Medical Aid
 
06:43:23.948 --> 06:43:23.958 align:start position:0%
and dying should have the same rights as
 
06:43:27.190 --> 06:43:27.200 align:start position:0%
anyone else we asked about
 
06:43:29.948 --> 06:43:29.958 align:start position:0%
devaluing lives and she said the lives
 
06:43:32.628 --> 06:43:32.638 align:start position:0%
of people with disabilities are devalued
 
06:43:35.030 --> 06:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
in all sorts of ways by our culture
 
06:43:37.270 --> 06:43:37.280 align:start position:0%
Medical Aid and dying law had nothing to
 
06:43:40.750 --> 06:43:40.760 align:start position:0%
do with that um our New Hampshire poll
 
06:43:42.948 --> 06:43:42.958 align:start position:0%
which you've heard about and we have
 
06:43:46.070 --> 06:43:46.080 align:start position:0%
hanging outside 75% of the individuals
 
06:43:47.628 --> 06:43:47.638 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire who identified as
 
06:43:50.350 --> 06:43:50.360 align:start position:0%
having dis abilities agreed with Medical
 
06:43:53.590 --> 06:43:53.600 align:start position:0%
Aid in dying that it should be legal the
 
06:43:56.948 --> 06:43:56.958 align:start position:0%
idea that Medical Aid a medical person
 
06:43:59.548 --> 06:43:59.558 align:start position:0%
would Co a disabled person into Medical
 
06:44:02.708 --> 06:44:02.718 align:start position:0%
Aid and dying would be a process not
 
06:44:05.628 --> 06:44:05.638 align:start position:0%
worth taking a dying person has to be
 
06:44:07.468 --> 06:44:07.478 align:start position:0%
the one who asks for Medical Aid in
 
06:44:10.430 --> 06:44:10.440 align:start position:0%
dying a caregiver guardian or a family
 
06:44:12.468 --> 06:44:12.478 align:start position:0%
member cannot do this it has to come
 
06:44:14.468 --> 06:44:14.478 align:start position:0%
direct from the person there are
 
06:44:16.830 --> 06:44:16.840 align:start position:0%
multiple steps of eligibility in order
 
06:44:18.750 --> 06:44:18.760 align:start position:0%
to go through the process
 
06:44:21.910 --> 06:44:21.920 align:start position:0%
there is no way to say well somebody's
 
06:44:25.110 --> 06:44:25.120 align:start position:0%
forcing me to do this you can't qualify
 
06:44:28.190 --> 06:44:28.200 align:start position:0%
solely for a disability old age chronic
 
06:44:31.468 --> 06:44:31.478 align:start position:0%
illness you must be terminally ill with
 
06:44:33.388 --> 06:44:33.398 align:start position:0%
six months less to live which you've
 
06:44:35.708 --> 06:44:35.718 align:start position:0%
heard over and over and then in the
 
06:44:37.830 --> 06:44:37.840 align:start position:0%
beginning I mentioned my daughter at the
 
06:44:40.308 --> 06:44:40.318 align:start position:0%
start of my
 
06:44:42.510 --> 06:44:42.520 align:start position:0%

years with severe chronic pain and
 
06:44:53.948 --> 06:44:53.958 align:start position:0%
medical complications as much as I
 
06:44:56.270 --> 06:44:56.280 align:start position:0%
believe in support in HB
 
06:44:59.150 --> 06:44:59.160 align:start position:0%
1283 my beautiful daughter would not
 
06:45:02.230 --> 06:45:02.240 align:start position:0%
have qualified because she did not have
 
06:45:04.788 --> 06:45:04.798 align:start position:0%
a terminal illness within 6 months or
 
06:45:07.948 --> 06:45:07.958 align:start position:0%
less to live the safeguards are in place
 
06:45:10.670 --> 06:45:10.680 align:start position:0%
if you don't qualify then you don't
 
06:45:13.548 --> 06:45:13.558 align:start position:0%
qualify but for those who do please

working in paliative care currently a
 
06:45:51.350 --> 06:45:51.360 align:start position:0%
Catholic Medical Center every day of my
 
06:45:53.308 --> 06:45:53.318 align:start position:0%
job I witness and care for patients and
 
06:45:54.708 --> 06:45:54.718 align:start position:0%
families who are faced with the
 
06:45:57.628 --> 06:45:57.638 align:start position:0%
unexpected and unimaginable namely the
 
06:45:59.910 --> 06:45:59.920 align:start position:0%
diagnosis and subsequent living with a
 
06:46:02.388 --> 06:46:02.398 align:start position:0%
serious illness that will significantly
 
06:46:04.590 --> 06:46:04.600 align:start position:0%
impact their lives perhaps it's a
 
06:46:06.628 --> 06:46:06.638 align:start position:0%
diagnosis of a terminal cancer bringing
 
06:46:09.430 --> 06:46:09.440 align:start position:0%
with it significant symptoms such as
 
06:46:12.388 --> 06:46:12.398 align:start position:0%
pain or facing Advanced cardiac issues
 
06:46:14.910 --> 06:46:14.920 align:start position:0%
and Pulmonary diseases which many times
 
06:46:16.910 --> 06:46:16.920 align:start position:0%
lead to recurrent hospitalizations and
 
06:46:18.590 --> 06:46:18.600 align:start position:0%
Progressive limitations
 
06:46:20.670 --> 06:46:20.680 align:start position:0%
to their day-to-day functional abilities
 
06:46:22.990 --> 06:46:23.000 align:start position:0%
and need for assistance from
 
06:46:25.468 --> 06:46:25.478 align:start position:0%
others each of these situations are hard
 
06:46:27.910 --> 06:46:27.920 align:start position:0%
to face and live with but it's possible
 
06:46:30.510 --> 06:46:30.520 align:start position:0%
and it's done by many people likely some
 
06:46:33.948 --> 06:46:33.958 align:start position:0%
in our own families and spheres of loved
 
06:46:36.510 --> 06:46:36.520 align:start position:0%
ones and while serious illness brings
 
06:46:38.350 --> 06:46:38.360 align:start position:0%
with it many challenges and
 
06:46:40.590 --> 06:46:40.600 align:start position:0%
vulnerabilities legalizing assisted
 
06:46:42.708 --> 06:46:42.718 align:start position:0%
suicide also being referred to as
 
06:46:46.388 --> 06:46:46.398 align:start position:0%
Medical Aid and dying is not the answer
 
06:46:48.628 --> 06:46:48.638 align:start position:0%
rather let us focus on inol the services
 
06:46:50.350 --> 06:46:50.360 align:start position:0%
and supports available to these
 
06:46:52.750 --> 06:46:52.760 align:start position:0%
individuals and their families paliative
 
06:46:55.270 --> 06:46:55.280 align:start position:0%
care is focused on helping people live
 
06:46:57.788 --> 06:46:57.798 align:start position:0%
with their serious illness for however
 
06:47:00.430 --> 06:47:00.440 align:start position:0%
much time they may have with the aim of
 
06:47:03.430 --> 06:47:03.440 align:start position:0%
alleviating physical
 
06:47:06.708 --> 06:47:06.718 align:start position:0%
psychological social and spiritual human
 
06:47:09.548 --> 06:47:09.558 align:start position:0%

Assistance or or experiencing unexpected
 
06:47:17.110 --> 06:47:17.120 align:start position:0%

making reconciliation love acceptance

distress can be explored and hopefully

alleviated therefore a paliative care
 
06:47:54.468 --> 06:47:54.478 align:start position:0%
team can distress all of these potential

domains of distress and

who are at the end of life human life is
 
06:49:56.388 --> 06:49:56.398 align:start position:0%
precious but its sole measure is not in

longevity quality of life as determined
 
06:50:01.628 --> 06:50:01.638 align:start position:0%
by each individual is an important
 
06:50:04.270 --> 06:50:04.280 align:start position:0%
aspect of its sanctity Medical Aid in
 
06:50:06.150 --> 06:50:06.160 align:start position:0%
dying empowers every terminally ill
 
06:50:08.308 --> 06:50:08.318 align:start position:0%
person to decide for themselves whether

06:50:15.510 --> 06:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
not just a theoretical theological
 
06:50:18.590 --> 06:50:18.600 align:start position:0%
question for me as a church Pastor I
 
06:50:20.070 --> 06:50:20.080 align:start position:0%
have borne witness to painful and
 
06:50:21.750 --> 06:50:21.760 align:start position:0%
prolonged suffering where this option
 
06:50:24.230 --> 06:50:24.240 align:start position:0%
has not been available and I have
 
06:50:26.150 --> 06:50:26.160 align:start position:0%
witnessed the calm peaceful and
 
06:50:28.590 --> 06:50:28.600 align:start position:0%
compassionate death of a dear friend and
 
06:50:30.868 --> 06:50:30.878 align:start position:0%
colleague who lived in Oregon where she
 
06:50:32.788 --> 06:50:32.798 align:start position:0%
was able to exercise her right to bring
 
06:50:36.230 --> 06:50:36.240 align:start position:0%
her own life to an end on her terms
 
06:50:38.590 --> 06:50:38.600 align:start position:0%
there's no doubt in my mind which of
 
06:50:40.628 --> 06:50:40.638 align:start position:0%
these consist of the good death we would
 
06:50:44.388 --> 06:50:44.398 align:start position:0%

06:51:37.510 --> 06:51:37.520 align:start position:0%
you briefly my story on December 18th of
 
06:51:40.510 --> 06:51:40.520 align:start position:0%
last year I lost my best friend my
 
06:51:43.110 --> 06:51:43.120 align:start position:0%
husband Bill he was as tough a man as
 
06:51:45.468 --> 06:51:45.478 align:start position:0%
you will ever meet and he fought hard
 
06:51:47.270 --> 06:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
battling cancer for three and a half
 
06:51:47.280 --> 06:51:48.150 align:start position:0%
battling cancer for three and a half
years

06:51:48.150 --> 06:51:48.160 align:start position:0%
years
 
06:51:50.070 --> 06:51:50.080 align:start position:0%
so that he could unselfishly be here for
 
06:51:52.708 --> 06:51:52.718 align:start position:0%
his loved ones bill was in and out of
 
06:51:55.628 --> 06:51:55.638 align:start position:0%
the hospital more times than I can count
 
06:51:58.030 --> 06:51:58.040 align:start position:0%
late last year he nearly lost his foot
 
06:52:00.750 --> 06:52:00.760 align:start position:0%
and became immobile this for him was the
 
06:52:04.030 --> 06:52:04.040 align:start position:0%
final straw sitting in a chair in a home
 
06:52:06.150 --> 06:52:06.160 align:start position:0%
he rebuilt for me unable to function in
 
06:52:08.190 --> 06:52:08.200 align:start position:0%
insignificant pain despite the
 
06:52:10.110 --> 06:52:10.120 align:start position:0%
medication assistance from a wonderful
 
06:52:10.120 --> 06:52:11.628 align:start position:0%
medication assistance from a wonderful
hospice

06:52:11.628 --> 06:52:11.638 align:start position:0%
hospice
 
06:52:15.150 --> 06:52:15.160 align:start position:0%
team House Bill 1283 passed would have
 
06:52:16.948 --> 06:52:16.958 align:start position:0%
allowed my husband to go peacefully on
 
06:52:20.548 --> 06:52:20.558 align:start position:0%
his turn Ms surrounded by his family and
 
06:52:22.270 --> 06:52:22.280 align:start position:0%
loved ones in the state he spent his
 
06:52:25.230 --> 06:52:25.240 align:start position:0%
entire life in instead we had to
 
06:52:27.788 --> 06:52:27.798 align:start position:0%
traveled to Vermont with only a few
 
06:52:29.590 --> 06:52:29.600 align:start position:0%
family members so that my husband could
 
06:52:32.830 --> 06:52:32.840 align:start position:0%
pass responsibly and safely and make his
 
06:52:35.788 --> 06:52:35.798 align:start position:0%
own choice and pass on his own terms
 
06:52:37.270 --> 06:52:37.280 align:start position:0%
ending the months and months of
 
06:52:39.910 --> 06:52:39.920 align:start position:0%
suffering he endured I urge you to
 
06:52:42.270 --> 06:52:42.280 align:start position:0%
support this critical house bill to
 
06:52:44.548 --> 06:52:44.558 align:start position:0%
embrace the meaning of our motto Live
 
06:52:47.670 --> 06:52:47.680 align:start position:0%
Free or Die and importantly embrace a
 
06:52:49.468 --> 06:52:49.478 align:start position:0%
person who has been diagnosed with a
 
06:52:51.590 --> 06:52:51.600 align:start position:0%
terminal illness and allow them to
 
06:52:53.990 --> 06:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
choose their own path and their own
 
06:52:56.230 --> 06:52:56.240 align:start position:0%
peace we use the word you made to
 
06:52:58.070 --> 06:52:58.080 align:start position:0%
underscore the importance of proper
 
06:53:00.510 --> 06:53:00.520 align:start position:0%
treatment and regulation of animals why
 
06:53:03.150 --> 06:53:03.160 align:start position:0%
is that word applic why isn't that word
 
06:53:06.190 --> 06:53:06.200 align:start position:0%
applicable to us to humans I ask you to
 
06:53:08.230 --> 06:53:08.240 align:start position:0%
consider for yourself what it means to
 
06:53:10.628 --> 06:53:10.638 align:start position:0%
be Humane and what kind of treatment you
 
06:53:12.750 --> 06:53:12.760 align:start position:0%
would want should you ever be terminally
 
06:53:16.590 --> 06:53:16.600 align:start position:0%
ill and suffering like my husband would
 
06:53:18.270 --> 06:53:18.280 align:start position:0%
you want the government to dictate to
 
06:53:20.868 --> 06:53:20.878 align:start position:0%
you you with a sound mind knowing your
 
06:53:22.750 --> 06:53:22.760 align:start position:0%
death is inevitable that you cannot die
 
06:53:24.750 --> 06:53:24.760 align:start position:0%
with what little dignity you have left
 
06:53:26.350 --> 06:53:26.360 align:start position:0%
and allow you to end the pain and the
 
06:53:28.750 --> 06:53:28.760 align:start position:0%
suffering you endured my husband and I
 
06:53:30.670 --> 06:53:30.680 align:start position:0%
traveled to Vermont so that he can make
 
06:53:33.590 --> 06:53:33.600 align:start position:0%
his own choice some might say we don't
 
06:53:35.190 --> 06:53:35.200 align:start position:0%
need this legislation because anyone
 
06:53:37.590 --> 06:53:37.600 align:start position:0%
else could do the same they are wrong
 
06:53:40.830 --> 06:53:40.840 align:start position:0%
for it's very difficult to arrange every
 
06:53:44.150 --> 06:53:44.160 align:start position:0%
step has to be in Vermont a fundament
 
06:53:45.910 --> 06:53:45.920 align:start position:0%
and fundamentally why should we have to
 
06:53:48.510 --> 06:53:48.520 align:start position:0%
leave the place we love to die in peace
 
06:53:50.670 --> 06:53:50.680 align:start position:0%
the morning of his death was Stormy with
 
06:53:53.150 --> 06:53:53.160 align:start position:0%
high winds and rain my brother and I
 
06:53:55.388 --> 06:53:55.398 align:start position:0%
could barely brother-in-law and I could
 
06:53:57.788 --> 06:53:57.798 align:start position:0%
barely get my husband into the truck a
 
06:53:59.948 --> 06:53:59.958 align:start position:0%
somber 1 hour and 30 minutes of driving
 
06:54:03.270 --> 06:54:03.280 align:start position:0%
later we experienced a process so
 
06:54:07.070 --> 06:54:07.080 align:start position:0%
responsible so warm so caring and so
 
06:54:09.150 --> 06:54:09.160 align:start position:0%
peaceful and so much in the best
 
06:54:11.070 --> 06:54:11.080 align:start position:0%
interest of my husband it has led me

Miller

06:55:21.270 --> 06:55:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:23.590 --> 06:55:23.600 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman members of the committee uh
 
06:55:25.468 --> 06:55:25.478 align:start position:0%
my name is Steve Wade I'm the executive
 
06:55:27.190 --> 06:55:27.200 align:start position:0%
director of The Brain Injury Association
 
06:55:29.548 --> 06:55:29.558 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I'm also a member of the
 
06:55:31.270 --> 06:55:31.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Coalition for suicide
 
06:55:33.990 --> 06:55:34.000 align:start position:0%
prevention which works uh mostly with
 
06:55:36.468 --> 06:55:36.478 align:start position:0%
vets and uh who have suffering with
 
06:55:39.628 --> 06:55:39.638 align:start position:0%
traumatic brain injury and PTSD so um
 
06:55:41.548 --> 06:55:41.558 align:start position:0%
really here I'm honored to be speaking
 
06:55:43.468 --> 06:55:43.478 align:start position:0%
for many of the survivors of brain
 
06:55:46.070 --> 06:55:46.080 align:start position:0%
injury in the state and their families
 
06:55:47.708 --> 06:55:47.718 align:start position:0%
family caregivers many those survivors
 
06:55:50.150 --> 06:55:50.160 align:start position:0%
are just are profoundly disabled uh and
 
06:55:52.830 --> 06:55:52.840 align:start position:0%
are unable to be here so uh our
 
06:55:55.468 --> 06:55:55.478 align:start position:0%
community stands firmly against this
 
06:55:58.468 --> 06:55:58.478 align:start position:0%
legislation uh our feeling is that uh
 
06:56:00.910 --> 06:56:00.920 align:start position:0%
Medical Aid and dying by physician
 
06:56:03.230 --> 06:56:03.240 align:start position:0%
assisted suicide they really go together
 
06:56:06.468 --> 06:56:06.478 align:start position:0%
you can't have one without the other uh
 
06:56:09.150 --> 06:56:09.160 align:start position:0%
and um also there's some real concerns
 
06:56:12.308 --> 06:56:12.318 align:start position:0%
about the message of choice and freedom
 
06:56:14.990 --> 06:56:15.000 align:start position:0%
are the limits to choice and freedom and
 
06:56:17.110 --> 06:56:17.120 align:start position:0%
we think there are there are spe
 
06:56:18.308 --> 06:56:18.318 align:start position:0%
specifically limits the choice and
 
06:56:19.948 --> 06:56:19.958 align:start position:0%
freedom when it affects the safety of
 
06:56:21.830 --> 06:56:21.840 align:start position:0%
other people or potentially impacts on
 
06:56:24.548 --> 06:56:24.558 align:start position:0%
other people and uh the feeling is that
 
06:56:26.830 --> 06:56:26.840 align:start position:0%
this is a dangerous bill it's dangerous
 
06:56:29.190 --> 06:56:29.200 align:start position:0%
for folks living with severe disability
 
06:56:30.548 --> 06:56:30.558 align:start position:0%
again I'm speaking on behalf of folks
 
06:56:31.990 --> 06:56:32.000 align:start position:0%
with traumatic brain injury which is one
 
06:56:35.548 --> 06:56:35.558 align:start position:0%
of the most severe so uh two reasons why
 
06:56:35.558 --> 06:56:36.388 align:start position:0%
of the most severe so uh two reasons why
it's

06:56:36.388 --> 06:56:36.398 align:start position:0%
it's
 
06:56:40.110 --> 06:56:40.120 align:start position:0%
dangerous one is because the the
 
06:56:44.030 --> 06:56:44.040 align:start position:0%
proponents of the law cite issues that
 
06:56:45.708 --> 06:56:45.718 align:start position:0%
essentially are the daily lived
 
06:56:47.070 --> 06:56:47.080 align:start position:0%
experience of people with with
 
06:56:49.548 --> 06:56:49.558 align:start position:0%
disabilities loneliness feelings of
 
06:56:54.030 --> 06:56:54.040 align:start position:0%
burdensomeness lack of control so the
 
06:56:56.230 --> 06:56:56.240 align:start position:0%
concern is what message does that send
 
06:56:57.670 --> 06:56:57.680 align:start position:0%
what message does that send to folks
 
06:57:00.430 --> 06:57:00.440 align:start position:0%
that we're trying to uh to support and
 
06:57:03.868 --> 06:57:03.878 align:start position:0%
be and be so and express solidarity with
 
06:57:05.628 --> 06:57:05.638 align:start position:0%
the other danger is most folks on
 
06:57:07.270 --> 06:57:07.280 align:start position:0%
disability in New Hampshire are on
 
06:57:09.388 --> 06:57:09.398 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and as you probably know
 
06:57:11.628 --> 06:57:11.638 align:start position:0%
Medicaid does not provide adquate access
 
06:57:14.430 --> 06:57:14.440 align:start position:0%
to paliative care so if a law like this
 
06:57:16.510 --> 06:57:16.520 align:start position:0%
exists what incentive would future
 
06:57:16.520 --> 06:57:17.830 align:start position:0%
exists what incentive would future
legisl

06:57:17.830 --> 06:57:17.840 align:start position:0%
legisl
 
06:57:20.910 --> 06:57:20.920 align:start position:0%
or funders or insurance companies have
 
06:57:23.548 --> 06:57:23.558 align:start position:0%
to expand and extend paliative care that
 
06:57:25.150 --> 06:57:25.160 align:start position:0%
whole system is a mess the long-term can
 
06:57:26.388 --> 06:57:26.398 align:start position:0%
system really is a mess in terms of
 
06:57:28.430 --> 06:57:28.440 align:start position:0%
folks on Medicaid there's really not
 
06:57:31.110 --> 06:57:31.120 align:start position:0%
great support so again I think there'd
 
06:57:34.190 --> 06:57:34.200 align:start position:0%
be a built-in disincentive for that so
 
06:57:37.030 --> 06:57:37.040 align:start position:0%
um the final point I wanted to make is
 
06:57:38.548 --> 06:57:38.558 align:start position:0%
we've heard a lot that this isn't
 
06:57:41.150 --> 06:57:41.160 align:start position:0%
suicide and all you have to do I we
 
06:57:43.030 --> 06:57:43.040 align:start position:0%
would disagree with that by the way all
 
06:57:45.070 --> 06:57:45.080 align:start position:0%
you have to do is go on your your cell
 
06:57:49.030 --> 06:57:49.040 align:start position:0%
phone and look up online or or Google um
 
06:57:50.788 --> 06:57:50.798 align:start position:0%
Medical Aid and dying or assisted
 
06:57:52.628 --> 06:57:52.638 align:start position:0%
suicide and the first thing that comes
 
06:57:55.830 --> 06:57:55.840 align:start position:0%
up is the heline for suicide prevention
 
06:57:58.468 --> 06:57:58.478 align:start position:0%
in big bold letters the nine is the 988
 
06:58:01.468 --> 06:58:01.478 align:start position:0%
number as well as um it says help is
 
06:58:03.990 --> 06:58:04.000 align:start position:0%
available suicide and crisis helpl line
 
06:58:05.430 --> 06:58:05.440 align:start position:0%
so that's the again the first thing that
 
06:58:07.910 --> 06:58:07.920 align:start position:0%
comes up so I don't know how people can
 
06:58:10.150 --> 06:58:10.160 align:start position:0%
say this is not suicide
 
06:58:12.590 --> 06:58:12.600 align:start position:0%
when it's recognized at least by the
 
06:58:15.510 --> 06:58:15.520 align:start position:0%
rest of the world that it's suicide so
 
06:58:17.948 --> 06:58:17.958 align:start position:0%
um so anyway again I thank you for for
 
06:58:20.548 --> 06:58:20.558 align:start position:0%
taking my testimony I also have uh in
 
06:58:23.270 --> 06:58:23.280 align:start position:0%

leading disability organizations many
 
06:58:29.468 --> 06:58:29.478 align:start position:0%
work with veterans living with PTSD and
 
06:58:32.590 --> 06:58:32.600 align:start position:0%

board of directors unanimously voted to
 
06:59:45.270 --> 06:59:45.280 align:start position:0%
strongly oppose this bill as veterans
 
06:59:46.868 --> 06:59:46.878 align:start position:0%
were concerned about the potential
 
06:59:49.430 --> 06:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
impact this bill could have on our
 
06:59:51.468 --> 06:59:51.478 align:start position:0%
community as you know veterans are the
 
06:59:53.868 --> 06:59:53.878 align:start position:0%
leading suicide risk category in the
 
06:59:57.190 --> 06:59:57.200 align:start position:0%
United States 16 veterans die every day
 
06:59:59.708 --> 06:59:59.718 align:start position:0%
by Suicide and here in New Hampshire
 
07:00:02.270 --> 07:00:02.280 align:start position:0%
veterans living with physical injuries
 
07:00:04.548 --> 07:00:04.558 align:start position:0%
and especially those living with tbii
 
07:00:07.708 --> 07:00:07.718 align:start position:0%
and PTSD are eight times more at risk
 
07:00:09.708 --> 07:00:09.718 align:start position:0%
than the general population yes this
 
07:00:11.788 --> 07:00:11.798 align:start position:0%
bill is about terminally ill people but
 
07:00:13.910 --> 07:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
it opens the door to unintended
 
07:00:16.270 --> 07:00:16.280 align:start position:0%
consequences and the message it sends to
 
07:00:19.388 --> 07:00:19.398 align:start position:0%
veterans is O is worrisome it normalizes
 
07:00:21.788 --> 07:00:21.798 align:start position:0%
suicide it undermines veteran Suicide
 
07:00:24.030 --> 07:00:24.040 align:start position:0%
Prevention efforts by by presenting
 
07:00:26.030 --> 07:00:26.040 align:start position:0%
suicide as a legit as a legitimate
 
07:00:28.788 --> 07:00:28.798 align:start position:0%
medical option it creates the the
 
07:00:30.590 --> 07:00:30.600 align:start position:0%
potential for veterans to feel pressured
 
07:00:33.430 --> 07:00:33.440 align:start position:0%
into making irreversible decisions it
 
07:00:35.590 --> 07:00:35.600 align:start position:0%
could unintentionally create permission
 
07:00:37.868 --> 07:00:37.878 align:start position:0%
for veterans to consider suicide
 
07:00:39.830 --> 07:00:39.840 align:start position:0%
especially if they see themselves as a
 
07:00:42.308 --> 07:00:42.318 align:start position:0%
burden to their families or communities
 
07:00:44.030 --> 07:00:44.040 align:start position:0%
it could present a dangerous alternative
 
07:00:45.788 --> 07:00:45.798 align:start position:0%
that devalues the inherent worth of
 
07:00:48.270 --> 07:00:48.280 align:start position:0%
veterans living with severe disabilities
 
07:00:50.468 --> 07:00:50.478 align:start position:0%
and chronic illness and we know from
 
07:00:52.750 --> 07:00:52.760 align:start position:0%
other States and Canada it opens the
 
07:00:55.430 --> 07:00:55.440 align:start position:0%
door to expanding assisted suicide to
 
07:00:58.708 --> 07:00:58.718 align:start position:0%
other vulnerable opt populations and we
 
07:01:00.788 --> 07:01:00.798 align:start position:0%
know medical Aiden dying legislation in
 
07:01:02.990 --> 07:01:03.000 align:start position:0%
Canada has led to recommendation of
 
07:01:05.510 --> 07:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
suicide to Veterans we owe a debt of
 
07:01:07.430 --> 07:01:07.440 align:start position:0%
gratitude to these veterans who have
 
07:01:09.708 --> 07:01:09.718 align:start position:0%
made the continue who make and continue
 
07:01:12.590 --> 07:01:12.600 align:start position:0%
to make sacrifices for our country this
 
07:01:14.468 --> 07:01:14.478 align:start position:0%
legislature has made enormous
 
07:01:16.788 --> 07:01:16.798 align:start position:0%
achievements in increased suicide
 
07:01:18.830 --> 07:01:18.840 align:start position:0%
prevention programs in our state this
 
07:01:20.910 --> 07:01:20.920 align:start position:0%
bill has a potential to undermine those
 
07:01:24.708 --> 07:01:24.718 align:start position:0%
Noble efforts so instead of this bill I
 
07:01:25.910 --> 07:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
would encourage you to explore
 
07:01:28.110 --> 07:01:28.120 align:start position:0%
legislation expanding veterans access to
 
07:01:30.270 --> 07:01:30.280 align:start position:0%
mental health programs and compassionate
 
07:01:31.990 --> 07:01:32.000 align:start position:0%
Health Care especially for veterans
 
07:01:34.750 --> 07:01:34.760 align:start position:0%
unable to access VA services this
 
07:01:36.990 --> 07:01:37.000 align:start position:0%
approach should be our priority it
 
07:01:38.750 --> 07:01:38.760 align:start position:0%
respects the dignity and worth of
 
07:01:41.150 --> 07:01:41.160 align:start position:0%
veterans and keeps Faith with pe's faith

07:01:56.350 --> 07:01:56.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:02:01.190 --> 07:02:01.200 align:start position:0%
ederly good afternoon oh most evening
 
07:02:03.868 --> 07:02:03.878 align:start position:0%
um I'm a registered nurse and a nursing
 
07:02:06.070 --> 07:02:06.080 align:start position:0%
home administrator I've spent the last
 
07:02:08.708 --> 07:02:08.718 align:start position:0%
35 years caring for frail Elders who
 
07:02:10.308 --> 07:02:10.318 align:start position:0%
have come into long-term care in the
 
07:02:12.590 --> 07:02:12.600 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire with this
 
07:02:14.388 --> 07:02:14.398 align:start position:0%
population of people that enter the
 
07:02:16.548 --> 07:02:16.558 align:start position:0%
nursing home they really are very
 
07:02:18.430 --> 07:02:18.440 align:start position:0%
vulnerable they're afraid they don't
 
07:02:20.190 --> 07:02:20.200 align:start position:0%
want to come but they don't have other
 
07:02:22.948 --> 07:02:22.958 align:start position:0%
options many of them dread having to be
 
07:02:25.628 --> 07:02:25.638 align:start position:0%
admitted to a nursing home often after
 
07:02:28.190 --> 07:02:28.200 align:start position:0%
they spent some time they adjust and we
 
07:02:30.308 --> 07:02:30.318 align:start position:0%
as a team are able to offer them quality
 
07:02:33.190 --> 07:02:33.200 align:start position:0%
of life and purpose and their vulnerable
 
07:02:34.990 --> 07:02:35.000 align:start position:0%
state our residents often state that
 
07:02:36.788 --> 07:02:36.798 align:start position:0%
they do not want to be a burden on their
 
07:02:39.350 --> 07:02:39.360 align:start position:0%
families it is my concern that there are
 
07:02:42.150 --> 07:02:42.160 align:start position:0%
those who would oper assisted suicide so
 
07:02:44.590 --> 07:02:44.600 align:start position:0%
they can avoid being a burden on their
 
07:02:46.868 --> 07:02:46.878 align:start position:0%
families this will influence their
 
07:02:49.150 --> 07:02:49.160 align:start position:0%
decision without a doubt it is our
 
07:02:51.070 --> 07:02:51.080 align:start position:0%
responsibility to show compassion to
 
07:02:53.030 --> 07:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
this population we serve and to promote
 
07:02:54.910 --> 07:02:54.920 align:start position:0%
their dignity and help them understand
 
07:02:56.830 --> 07:02:56.840 align:start position:0%
that they matter they're loved they're
 
07:02:58.750 --> 07:02:58.760 align:start position:0%
important there have been times when
 
07:03:00.350 --> 07:03:00.360 align:start position:0%
I've seen a resident be admitted to
 
07:03:02.590 --> 07:03:02.600 align:start position:0%
hospice often many of the medications
 
07:03:03.990 --> 07:03:04.000 align:start position:0%
are stopped and they're only giving
 
07:03:05.910 --> 07:03:05.920 align:start position:0%
Comfort mes which which ease their pain
 
07:03:08.468 --> 07:03:08.478 align:start position:0%
and other symptoms there have been times
 
07:03:10.070 --> 07:03:10.080 align:start position:0%
when we've seen them improve when they
 
07:03:12.350 --> 07:03:12.360 align:start position:0%
come off their meds they've lived long
 
07:03:14.030 --> 07:03:14.040 align:start position:0%
past the six-month Mark and have
 
07:03:16.430 --> 07:03:16.440 align:start position:0%
improved quality of life I've seen res
 
07:03:18.468 --> 07:03:18.478 align:start position:0%
resents come in with a diagnosis of
 
07:03:20.590 --> 07:03:20.600 align:start position:0%
failure to thrive in the expectation
 
07:03:22.788 --> 07:03:22.798 align:start position:0%
they will only have a few weeks to live
 
07:03:24.788 --> 07:03:24.798 align:start position:0%
more than once I've seen a resident like
 
07:03:26.628 --> 07:03:26.638 align:start position:0%
this get better and live for a few more
 
07:03:29.070 --> 07:03:29.080 align:start position:0%
years I attribute this to coming into a
 
07:03:30.628 --> 07:03:30.638 align:start position:0%
supportive environment where they feel
 
07:03:32.110 --> 07:03:32.120 align:start position:0%
that they're matter and they're given a
 
07:03:35.708 --> 07:03:35.718 align:start position:0%
reason to live every day to me it is not
 
07:03:39.628 --> 07:03:39.638 align:start position:0%
the answer uh and sends a message um
 
07:03:42.388 --> 07:03:42.398 align:start position:0%
that we can that you know you can end it
 
07:03:44.150 --> 07:03:44.160 align:start position:0%
all and you can lessen the burden on
 
07:03:46.670 --> 07:03:46.680 align:start position:0%
your family and to to all of us this is
 
07:03:49.308 --> 07:03:49.318 align:start position:0%
a wrong message if this bill is passed
 
07:03:50.948 --> 07:03:50.958 align:start position:0%
it would lead to a slippery slope of
 
07:03:53.788 --> 07:03:53.798 align:start position:0%
normalizing suicide in other populations
 
07:03:55.708 --> 07:03:55.718 align:start position:0%
we have a serious problem with suicide
 
07:03:57.308 --> 07:03:57.318 align:start position:0%
in the state and with groups such as
 
07:03:59.510 --> 07:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
atrisk teens veterans and those with
 
07:04:01.430 --> 07:04:01.440 align:start position:0%
disabilities passing this bill would
 
07:04:03.430 --> 07:04:03.440 align:start position:0%
only lead to more suicides among these
 
07:04:05.270 --> 07:04:05.280 align:start position:0%
vulnerable populations and then the
 
07:04:07.510 --> 07:04:07.520 align:start position:0%
problem will only get worse we have
 
07:04:09.510 --> 07:04:09.520 align:start position:0%
multiple ways we can ease symptoms
 
07:04:11.830 --> 07:04:11.840 align:start position:0%
during a residence terminal illness with
 
07:04:13.750 --> 07:04:13.760 align:start position:0%
a different option for pain control
 
07:04:16.030 --> 07:04:16.040 align:start position:0%
symptom control there's really no reason
 
07:04:19.030 --> 07:04:19.040 align:start position:0%
for people to suffer please vote no on
 
07:04:21.190 --> 07:04:21.200 align:start position:0%
this bill we have a moral obligation to
 
07:04:22.910 --> 07:04:22.920 align:start position:0%
take care of those who are most vable
 
07:04:25.190 --> 07:04:25.200 align:start position:0%
with compassion dignity and respect we
 
07:04:27.308 --> 07:04:27.318 align:start position:0%
have an obligation to promote life and
 
07:04:29.708 --> 07:04:29.718 align:start position:0%
living until the time of death comes
 
07:04:32.150 --> 07:04:32.160 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you questions seeing
 
07:04:35.948 --> 07:04:35.958 align:start position:0%

my home is in Rochester thank you for
 
07:04:58.708 --> 07:04:58.718 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to provide public
 
07:05:03.110 --> 07:05:03.120 align:start position:0%
testimony on my opposition to House Bill
 
07:05:06.628 --> 07:05:06.638 align:start position:0%
1283 I am the mother of four children I
 
07:05:09.308 --> 07:05:09.318 align:start position:0%
was a caregiver for 23
 
07:05:12.468 --> 07:05:12.478 align:start position:0%
years to my daughter Sarah when Sarah
 
07:05:15.308 --> 07:05:15.318 align:start position:0%
was 11 years old she was involved in an
 
07:05:17.708 --> 07:05:17.718 align:start position:0%
accident which resulted in her
 
07:05:19.788 --> 07:05:19.798 align:start position:0%
sustaining a brain injury
 
07:05:22.190 --> 07:05:22.200 align:start position:0%
quadriplegia she was fed through a g
 
07:05:25.388 --> 07:05:25.398 align:start position:0%
tube she was breathing through a tra for
 
07:05:28.990 --> 07:05:29.000 align:start position:0%
a period of time and was nonverbal she
 
07:05:32.190 --> 07:05:32.200 align:start position:0%
was 100% dependent on her care from
 
07:05:35.750 --> 07:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
others Sarah wanted to live to be
 
07:05:39.468 --> 07:05:39.478 align:start position:0%
surrounded by the love of her family my
 
07:05:42.948 --> 07:05:42.958 align:start position:0%
family wanted Sarah to be in our lives
 
07:05:47.110 --> 07:05:47.120 align:start position:0%
Sarah taught us to be grateful of life
 
07:05:48.868 --> 07:05:48.878 align:start position:0%
as life is a
 
07:05:53.708 --> 07:05:53.718 align:start position:0%
blessing let's not put sick and disabled
 
07:05:57.948 --> 07:05:57.958 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire citizens in a position of
 
07:06:01.750 --> 07:06:01.760 align:start position:0%
justifying why they do not choose the
 
07:06:05.670 --> 07:06:05.680 align:start position:0%
state endorsed option of assisted
 
07:06:09.230 --> 07:06:09.240 align:start position:0%
suicide disabled people's bodily
 
07:06:13.230 --> 07:06:13.240 align:start position:0%
autonomy is constantly under threat as
 
07:06:16.388 --> 07:06:16.398 align:start position:0%
they are denied access to home
 
07:06:19.548 --> 07:06:19.558 align:start position:0%
community-based care institutionalized
 
07:06:22.910 --> 07:06:22.920 align:start position:0%
against their will receive inadequate
 
07:06:25.990 --> 07:06:26.000 align:start position:0%
Health Care have limited opportunities
 
07:06:27.230 --> 07:06:27.240 align:start position:0%
and much
 
07:06:31.110 --> 07:06:31.120 align:start position:0%
more sadly there are people that believe
 
07:06:34.230 --> 07:06:34.240 align:start position:0%
that living with the disability is worse
 
07:06:37.868 --> 07:06:37.878 align:start position:0%
than the fate of death do we want the
 
07:06:41.070 --> 07:06:41.080 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire to decide what
 
07:06:45.468 --> 07:06:45.478 align:start position:0%
quality of life merits death I certainly
 
07:06:45.478 --> 07:06:46.708 align:start position:0%
quality of life merits death I certainly
don't

07:06:46.708 --> 07:06:46.718 align:start position:0%
don't
 
07:06:49.910 --> 07:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
today we have heard a lot about choice
 
07:06:53.788 --> 07:06:53.798 align:start position:0%
and peace of mind but at what cost by
 
07:06:57.708 --> 07:06:57.718 align:start position:0%
putting vulnerable people at risk I urge
 
07:07:01.030 --> 07:07:01.040 align:start position:0%
you to vote against House Bill
 
07:07:04.308 --> 07:07:04.318 align:start position:0%
1283 thank you for listening to thank
 
07:07:07.190 --> 07:07:07.200 align:start position:0%
you questions seeing none thank you very
 
07:07:10.830 --> 07:07:10.840 align:start position:0%
much Mary fahe and next will be uh
 
07:07:19.708 --> 07:07:19.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:07:21.468 --> 07:07:21.478 align:start position:0%
hello my name is Mary fahe I'm a
 
07:07:23.270 --> 07:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
resident of nasua and I'm here today to
 
07:07:26.270 --> 07:07:26.280 align:start position:0%
speak in opposition to hb1 1283 I'd like
 
07:07:27.708 --> 07:07:27.718 align:start position:0%
to address how this bill undermines
 
07:07:29.430 --> 07:07:29.440 align:start position:0%
Suicide Prevention efforts and puts
 
07:07:31.030 --> 07:07:31.040 align:start position:0%
vulnerable individuals at risk for
 
07:07:33.590 --> 07:07:33.600 align:start position:0%
suicide Elation or attempts I have more
 
07:07:35.110 --> 07:07:35.120 align:start position:0%
chronic incurable and life-altering
 
07:07:37.628 --> 07:07:37.638 align:start position:0%
diseases than I can count on one hand I
 
07:07:39.388 --> 07:07:39.398 align:start position:0%
am also the Survivor of a suicide
 
07:07:40.788 --> 07:07:40.798 align:start position:0%
attempt and have dealt with strong
 
07:07:43.030 --> 07:07:43.040 align:start position:0%
suicidal ideation over the increase of
 
07:07:44.788 --> 07:07:44.798 align:start position:0%
in physical suffering and the loss of my
 
07:07:46.910 --> 07:07:46.920 align:start position:0%
health as I knew it State sanctioned
 
07:07:48.750 --> 07:07:48.760 align:start position:0%
suicide creates a scale of value on
 
07:07:50.590 --> 07:07:50.600 align:start position:0%
human lives deeming some more worthy
 
07:07:52.628 --> 07:07:52.638 align:start position:0%
than others we are no longer stating
 
07:07:54.150 --> 07:07:54.160 align:start position:0%
that we should protect all lives from
 
07:07:56.230 --> 07:07:56.240 align:start position:0%
suicide rather we are stating that some
 
07:07:57.670 --> 07:07:57.680 align:start position:0%
lives are no longer protected from
 
07:07:59.548 --> 07:07:59.558 align:start position:0%
suicide that some lives are simply not
 
07:08:01.270 --> 07:08:01.280 align:start position:0%
worth living and we are making this
 
07:08:03.548 --> 07:08:03.558 align:start position:0%
judgment on the basis of physical health
 
07:08:05.430 --> 07:08:05.440 align:start position:0%
we strive to prevent suicide in healthy
 
07:08:06.990 --> 07:08:07.000 align:start position:0%
individuals because of the knowledge
 
07:08:08.190 --> 07:08:08.200 align:start position:0%
that their lives have inherent and
 
07:08:10.308 --> 07:08:10.318 align:start position:0%
immeasurable value it is not our place
 
07:08:12.230 --> 07:08:12.240 align:start position:0%
to remove that value simply simply
 
07:08:14.510 --> 07:08:14.520 align:start position:0%
because a life is plagued by illness hb1
 
07:08:16.350 --> 07:08:16.360 align:start position:0%
1283 sends the message that
 
07:08:17.990 --> 07:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
intentionally and unnaturally ending
 
07:08:19.670 --> 07:08:19.680 align:start position:0%
one's life in the face of suffering is a
 
07:08:22.030 --> 07:08:22.040 align:start position:0%
legitimate option my heart goes out to
 
07:08:23.468 --> 07:08:23.478 align:start position:0%
those facing death and learning to
 
07:08:24.910 --> 07:08:24.920 align:start position:0%
accept the time they have left in this
 
07:08:26.948 --> 07:08:26.958 align:start position:0%
life I've had my share of encounters
 
07:08:28.110 --> 07:08:28.120 align:start position:0%
with death and I know it can be
 
07:08:29.990 --> 07:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
terrifying I have sat in a doctor's
 
07:08:31.510 --> 07:08:31.520 align:start position:0%
office and been told that a quarter of
 
07:08:33.150 --> 07:08:33.160 align:start position:0%
people with my condition die before the
 
07:08:35.350 --> 07:08:35.360 align:start position:0%
age of 30 I am blessed to know that my
 
07:08:37.030 --> 07:08:37.040 align:start position:0%
version of the condition is mild and
 
07:08:38.430 --> 07:08:38.440 align:start position:0%
very responsive to non-invasive
 
07:08:40.388 --> 07:08:40.398 align:start position:0%
treatment but I did not always know this
 
07:08:42.750 --> 07:08:42.760 align:start position:0%
and live for some time with uncertainty
 
07:08:44.230 --> 07:08:44.240 align:start position:0%
one of the greatest burdens in my health
 
07:08:46.150 --> 07:08:46.160 align:start position:0%
Journey has not been the illness itself
 
07:08:48.070 --> 07:08:48.080 align:start position:0%
but reconciling the unavoidable pain
 
07:08:50.270 --> 07:08:50.280 align:start position:0%
discomfort discomfort and fear with the
 
07:08:52.468 --> 07:08:52.478 align:start position:0%
goodness of life I still struggle to
 
07:08:53.948 --> 07:08:53.958 align:start position:0%
accept this but while I can hardly
 
07:08:56.150 --> 07:08:56.160 align:start position:0%
remember a day without bodily suffering
 
07:08:57.628 --> 07:08:57.638 align:start position:0%
I also cannot remember a day where I
 
07:08:59.110 --> 07:08:59.120 align:start position:0%
have not been able to find great meaning
 
07:09:01.548 --> 07:09:01.558 align:start position:0%
and joy when the proponents of this bill
 
07:09:03.308 --> 07:09:03.318 align:start position:0%
state that it is not only permissible
 
07:09:05.110 --> 07:09:05.120 align:start position:0%
but dignified to take one's life when
 
07:09:07.308 --> 07:09:07.318 align:start position:0%
confronting great illness it undermines
 
07:09:09.150 --> 07:09:09.160 align:start position:0%
the efforts of all those like myself who
 
07:09:10.628 --> 07:09:10.638 align:start position:0%
have fought so hard to live in the face
 
07:09:12.830 --> 07:09:12.840 align:start position:0%
of grave and often silent suffering
 
07:09:14.350 --> 07:09:14.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for hearing my testimony and I
 
07:09:16.030 --> 07:09:16.040 align:start position:0%

speak with you
today

07:09:50.510 --> 07:09:50.520 align:start position:0%
today
 
07:09:53.990 --> 07:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
um I cannot support this bill I value
 
07:09:55.510 --> 07:09:55.520 align:start position:0%
the lives of those that we care for
 
07:09:57.868 --> 07:09:57.878 align:start position:0%
until the end of their natural life it
 
07:10:00.230 --> 07:10:00.240 align:start position:0%
has been ingrained in me we take care of
 
07:10:02.548 --> 07:10:02.558 align:start position:0%
those that are frail and vulnerable but
 
07:10:04.270 --> 07:10:04.280 align:start position:0%
also these are the people who have given
 
07:10:06.948 --> 07:10:06.958 align:start position:0%
life supported life and have given us
 
07:10:09.510 --> 07:10:09.520 align:start position:0%
love I cannot fathom that we are here
 
07:10:11.788 --> 07:10:11.798 align:start position:0%
today talking about whether or not it is
 
07:10:13.388 --> 07:10:13.398 align:start position:0%
right for a person to be able to make a
 
07:10:15.990 --> 07:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
choice to end their life and that the
 
07:10:19.430 --> 07:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
terminally terminally ill May cost too
 
07:10:22.388 --> 07:10:22.398 align:start position:0%
much money to prolong their
 
07:10:25.030 --> 07:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
lives I don't know I struggle with who
 
07:10:28.270 --> 07:10:28.280 align:start position:0%
is just enough to really measure when a
 
07:10:30.510 --> 07:10:30.520 align:start position:0%
person is to be brought to
 
07:10:33.590 --> 07:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
death for the terminal person are we to
 
07:10:36.190 --> 07:10:36.200 align:start position:0%
say Well they're going to die anyway
 
07:10:38.590 --> 07:10:38.600 align:start position:0%
Perhaps it is best can we give them
 
07:10:41.030 --> 07:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
something for their pain and just put
 
07:10:43.868 --> 07:10:43.878 align:start position:0%
them out of misery but who or what can
 
07:10:46.350 --> 07:10:46.360 align:start position:0%
really determine that
 
07:10:48.708 --> 07:10:48.718 align:start position:0%
how can this be justified in our hearts
 
07:10:50.430 --> 07:10:50.440 align:start position:0%
and then how do we carry this within us
 
07:10:51.868 --> 07:10:51.878 align:start position:0%
for the rest of our
 
07:10:54.468 --> 07:10:54.478 align:start position:0%
lives people are put here on Earth for a
 
07:10:56.868 --> 07:10:56.878 align:start position:0%
certain time people should die their
 
07:10:59.990 --> 07:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
natural end of life the more we minimize
 
07:11:02.868 --> 07:11:02.878 align:start position:0%
minimize life the more we continue to
 
07:11:05.070 --> 07:11:05.080 align:start position:0%
evolve towards this
 
07:11:07.308 --> 07:11:07.318 align:start position:0%
travesty we should stop the thoughts of
 
07:11:09.070 --> 07:11:09.080 align:start position:0%
destroying humanity and expelling
 
07:11:11.910 --> 07:11:11.920 align:start position:0%
morality as we know it if this happens
 
07:11:15.110 --> 07:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
have we lost our faith our dignity our
 
07:11:18.110 --> 07:11:18.120 align:start position:0%
traditions in our moral comp
 
07:11:20.388 --> 07:11:20.398 align:start position:0%
Compass but yet we fight the struggle
 
07:11:22.030 --> 07:11:22.040 align:start position:0%
each day for the lives of those who are
 
07:11:25.388 --> 07:11:25.398 align:start position:0%
addicted to drugs we start by providing
 
07:11:27.830 --> 07:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
Naran we fight and struggle each day for
 
07:11:29.750 --> 07:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
those born with severe
 
07:11:32.230 --> 07:11:32.240 align:start position:0%
disabilities to do all that we can to
 
07:11:33.788 --> 07:11:33.798 align:start position:0%
find their best
 
07:11:37.110 --> 07:11:37.120 align:start position:0%
days why because we value their
 
07:11:39.430 --> 07:11:39.440 align:start position:0%
lives nearly four years ago we had a
 
07:11:41.030 --> 07:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
resident who was in the hospital for
 
07:11:43.468 --> 07:11:43.478 align:start position:0%
three or 4 weeks prior to that she lived
 
07:11:45.910 --> 07:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
in Assisted Living we received a phone
 
07:11:47.350 --> 07:11:47.360 align:start position:0%
call from the hospital saying that she
 
07:11:49.150 --> 07:11:49.160 align:start position:0%
should be brought back to our building
 
07:11:51.830 --> 07:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
her home to die we were warned that she
 
07:11:53.948 --> 07:11:53.958 align:start position:0%
may not make it even through the night
 
07:11:56.190 --> 07:11:56.200 align:start position:0%
when she came through the stret through
 
07:11:57.910 --> 07:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
the door on the stretcher I heard her
 
07:12:00.430 --> 07:12:00.440 align:start position:0%
giving directions to the EMTs to turn to
 
07:12:02.670 --> 07:12:02.680 align:start position:0%
the hallway instead of the elevator I
 
07:12:05.190 --> 07:12:05.200 align:start position:0%
was really confused first of all because
 
07:12:07.628 --> 07:12:07.638 align:start position:0%
she was speaking secondly because she
 
07:12:09.468 --> 07:12:09.478 align:start position:0%
was giving directions to where her room
 
07:12:11.990 --> 07:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
was I went over to her and I told her
 
07:12:13.070 --> 07:12:13.080 align:start position:0%
that we were going to care for her
 
07:12:15.350 --> 07:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
upstairs now if she would if she would
 
07:12:18.070 --> 07:12:18.080 align:start position:0%
allow us to do that she looked at me and
 
07:12:21.548 --> 07:12:21.558 align:start position:0%
said okay that will be good well I guess
 
07:12:23.868 --> 07:12:23.878 align:start position:0%
it was good because 4 years later she
 
07:12:25.468 --> 07:12:25.478 align:start position:0%
has filled her time by sharing her
 
07:12:27.868 --> 07:12:27.878 align:start position:0%
talents as a seamstress shared many
 
07:12:30.230 --> 07:12:30.240 align:start position:0%
stories of her history visited other
 
07:12:32.388 --> 07:12:32.398 align:start position:0%
people in the nursing home and provided
 
07:12:34.468 --> 07:12:34.478 align:start position:0%
much laughter to so many of us through
 
07:12:36.990 --> 07:12:37.000 align:start position:0%
these years apparently she must have
 
07:12:39.070 --> 07:12:39.080 align:start position:0%
known that she wasn't ready yet it
 
07:12:42.110 --> 07:12:42.120 align:start position:0%
wasn't her time I do thank you for your
 
07:12:45.788 --> 07:12:45.798 align:start position:0%

07:15:58.548 --> 07:15:58.558 align:start position:0%
an idea about what constitutes life and
 
07:16:01.548 --> 07:16:01.558 align:start position:0%
a disability with a uh with a life with
 
07:16:04.628 --> 07:16:04.638 align:start position:0%
dignity and we have to be really careful
 
07:16:06.948 --> 07:16:06.958 align:start position:0%
about having a narrow construct of that
 
07:16:08.590 --> 07:16:08.600 align:start position:0%
because I happen to know plenty of
 
07:16:12.430 --> 07:16:12.440 align:start position:0%
people with disabilities who are
 
07:16:14.750 --> 07:16:14.760 align:start position:0%
incontinent who have plenty of dignity
 
07:16:16.830 --> 07:16:16.840 align:start position:0%
in their life and that should not be one
 
07:16:18.468 --> 07:16:18.478 align:start position:0%
of the metrics by which someone is
 
07:16:20.548 --> 07:16:20.558 align:start position:0%
allowed to determine that their life is
 
07:16:23.228 --> 07:16:23.238 align:start position:0%
no longer worth living as one tiny
 
07:16:27.308 --> 07:16:27.318 align:start position:0%
example the NCD position remains set
 
07:16:30.388 --> 07:16:30.398 align:start position:0%
steadfast since 1997 their 2019
 
07:16:32.910 --> 07:16:32.920 align:start position:0%

70-page well- researched document
 
07:16:40.788 --> 07:16:40.798 align:start position:0%
detailing the serious limits of supposed
 
07:16:43.150 --> 07:16:43.160 align:start position:0%
safeguards the lack of oversight in
 
07:16:46.590 --> 07:16:46.600 align:start position:0%
states with assisted suicide almost zero
 
07:16:48.868 --> 07:16:48.878 align:start position:0%
investigatory power of mistakes and
 
07:16:51.350 --> 07:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
abuse the loosening of the rules
 
07:16:53.868 --> 07:16:53.878 align:start position:0%
phenomenon which has happened in every
 
07:16:57.750 --> 07:16:57.760 align:start position:0%
single state where medical end in in
 
07:16:59.948 --> 07:16:59.958 align:start position:0%
Medical Aid and dying or end of life
 
07:17:02.868 --> 07:17:02.878 align:start position:0%
options or whatever euphemism you prefer
 
07:17:04.948 --> 07:17:04.958 align:start position:0%
can I tell you ma'am your your over your
 
07:17:09.750 --> 07:17:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:17:13.190 --> 07:17:13.200 align:start position:0%
yes proponents of hb1 1283 are
 
07:17:16.308 --> 07:17:16.318 align:start position:0%
leveraging the feeling of citizens on
 
07:17:18.948 --> 07:17:18.958 align:start position:0%
the dying process to change the law
 
07:17:21.308 --> 07:17:21.318 align:start position:0%
rather than demanding to make our Health
 
07:17:23.430 --> 07:17:23.440 align:start position:0%
Care system in this particular case our
 
07:17:26.670 --> 07:17:26.680 align:start position:0%
paliative care system more robust given
 
07:17:28.670 --> 07:17:28.680 align:start position:0%
our extraordinary medical Technologies
 
07:17:31.948 --> 07:17:31.958 align:start position:0%
intract intractable pain is a failure in
 
07:17:34.350 --> 07:17:34.360 align:start position:0%
the delivery of treatment and physician
 
07:17:37.110 --> 07:17:37.120 align:start position:0%
training that failure is why physician
 
07:17:39.670 --> 07:17:39.680 align:start position:0%
assisted suicide is insidiously becoming
 
07:17:41.548 --> 07:17:41.558 align:start position:0%
normalized so I I really need to for you
 
07:17:44.110 --> 07:17:44.120 align:start position:0%
to sum up ma'am please thank
 
07:17:44.120 --> 07:17:46.070 align:start position:0%

you
 
07:17:49.628 --> 07:17:49.638 align:start position:0%
it is not a mode of care to put in the

communities of color live with day in

and day out we need to address Health
 
07:18:05.830 --> 07:18:05.840 align:start position:0%
inequities before we can do anything of
 
07:18:08.228 --> 07:18:08.238 align:start position:0%

um I'm going off script here as you
 
07:18:52.430 --> 07:18:52.440 align:start position:0%
requested I'd like to touch on a couple
 
07:18:54.750 --> 07:18:54.760 align:start position:0%
of things uh that we've heard repeatedly
 
07:18:57.190 --> 07:18:57.200 align:start position:0%
for some people I I am first of all uh
 
07:19:00.750 --> 07:19:00.760 align:start position:0%
strongly in favor of uh House Bill
 
07:19:04.708 --> 07:19:04.718 align:start position:0%
1283 this bill is not suicide this bill
 
07:19:07.590 --> 07:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
is not a slippery slope this bill is not
 
07:19:12.150 --> 07:19:12.160 align:start position:0%
a disabilities bill um and it is a tool
 
07:19:14.670 --> 07:19:14.680 align:start position:0%
that I need in my toolbox and with very
 
07:19:14.680 --> 07:19:15.628 align:start position:0%
that I need in my toolbox and with very
rare

07:19:15.628 --> 07:19:15.638 align:start position:0%
rare
 
07:19:18.868 --> 07:19:18.878 align:start position:0%
exceptions um I want to touch on I I I
 
07:19:21.110 --> 07:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
agree wholeheartedly with a lot of what
 
07:19:23.750 --> 07:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
some of my uh colleagues uh earlier
 
07:19:25.350 --> 07:19:25.360 align:start position:0%
Physicians and and uh nurse
 
07:19:28.788 --> 07:19:28.798 align:start position:0%
practitioners said about how uh
 
07:19:31.030 --> 07:19:31.040 align:start position:0%
paliative care and hospice care can meet
 
07:19:33.590 --> 07:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
the need in most cases we're talking
 
07:19:36.110 --> 07:19:36.120 align:start position:0%
about most cases this is a a bill that
 
07:19:39.510 --> 07:19:39.520 align:start position:0%
would help in those outlier cases where
 
07:19:43.628 --> 07:19:43.638 align:start position:0%
symptoms and uh details of an illness
 
07:19:45.830 --> 07:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
can lead to things that are are not
 
07:19:48.468 --> 07:19:48.478 align:start position:0%
easily remedied with standard paliative
 
07:19:51.228 --> 07:19:51.238 align:start position:0%
care and hospice care um without getting
 
07:19:53.750 --> 07:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
too graphic we heard from uh people
 
07:19:57.590 --> 07:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
earlier uh and again in pulmonary
 
07:19:59.590 --> 07:19:59.600 align:start position:0%
medicine you're talking about breathing
 
07:20:00.948 --> 07:20:00.958 align:start position:0%
you're talking about the airway and when
 
07:20:03.548 --> 07:20:03.558 align:start position:0%
you have tumors that are malignant and
 
07:20:05.308 --> 07:20:05.318 align:start position:0%
eroding into blood vessels or
 
07:20:09.150 --> 07:20:09.160 align:start position:0%
obstructing Airways um you're you're
 
07:20:11.750 --> 07:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
getting to a point where it is so
 
07:20:15.750 --> 07:20:15.760 align:start position:0%
unbelievably difficult to uh treat those
 
07:20:18.548 --> 07:20:18.558 align:start position:0%
uh endof life situations that can be
 
07:20:21.190 --> 07:20:21.200 align:start position:0%
extremely traumatic as we heard earlier
 
07:20:23.548 --> 07:20:23.558 align:start position:0%
so a bill like this would uh be able to
 
07:20:25.270 --> 07:20:25.280 align:start position:0%
address those symptom needs and those
 
07:20:28.468 --> 07:20:28.478 align:start position:0%
rare exceptions where a person cannot
 
07:20:31.030 --> 07:20:31.040 align:start position:0%
live out their days uh and have a
 
07:20:33.708 --> 07:20:33.718 align:start position:0%
natural death with standard hospice care
 
07:20:35.750 --> 07:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
we need this type of uh care for those
 
07:20:38.670 --> 07:20:38.680 align:start position:0%
rare exceptions where somebody has such
 
07:20:40.948 --> 07:20:40.958 align:start position:0%
enormous symptom burden or the potential
 
07:20:44.228 --> 07:20:44.238 align:start position:0%
for a a horrible end of life uh I would
 
07:20:47.468 --> 07:20:47.478 align:start position:0%
just like to and
 
07:20:50.150 --> 07:20:50.160 align:start position:0%
uh I think the answer to whether this
 
07:20:51.788 --> 07:20:51.798 align:start position:0%
bill should become law lies in the
 
07:20:53.388 --> 07:20:53.398 align:start position:0%
precedent set forth in the opening
 
07:20:56.388 --> 07:20:56.398 align:start position:0%
sentence of New Hampshire statute 137 J1
 
07:20:59.030 --> 07:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
where it states clearly that quote the
 
07:21:00.868 --> 07:21:00.878 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire recognizes that
 
07:21:02.910 --> 07:21:02.920 align:start position:0%
individual persons have the right
 
07:21:04.948 --> 07:21:04.958 align:start position:0%
founded in the autonomy and sanctity of
 
07:21:07.308 --> 07:21:07.318 align:start position:0%
a person to control the decisions
 
07:21:08.948 --> 07:21:08.958 align:start position:0%
relating to the rendering of their own
 
07:21:10.628 --> 07:21:10.638 align:start position:0%
Medical Care end
 
07:21:13.388 --> 07:21:13.398 align:start position:0%
quote uh and as we've heard here already
 
07:21:15.150 --> 07:21:15.160 align:start position:0%
we don't get to choose what a Affliction
 
07:21:17.430 --> 07:21:17.440 align:start position:0%
may be visited upon us we are all
 
07:21:20.110 --> 07:21:20.120 align:start position:0%
patience and waiting any one of us or a
 
07:21:22.150 --> 07:21:22.160 align:start position:0%
loved one may face a profoundly
 
07:21:24.750 --> 07:21:24.760 align:start position:0%
debilitating terminal illness robbing us
 
07:21:26.990 --> 07:21:27.000 align:start position:0%
of the ability to eat breathe and live
 
07:21:30.868 --> 07:21:30.878 align:start position:0%
in Comfort um in that case many of us
 
07:21:33.228 --> 07:21:33.238 align:start position:0%
would want the peace of mind and relief
 
07:21:36.070 --> 07:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
that Medical Aid and dying offers um and
 
07:21:38.670 --> 07:21:38.680 align:start position:0%
I would like to have this uh available
 
07:21:40.948 --> 07:21:40.958 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire as we do in
 
07:21:42.788 --> 07:21:42.798 align:start position:0%
Vermont and as my parents have available
 
07:21:44.910 --> 07:21:44.920 align:start position:0%
to them in Maine thank you for your time
 
07:21:48.270 --> 07:21:48.280 align:start position:0%

enough I believe that a copy my
 
07:22:13.388 --> 07:22:13.398 align:start position:0%
testimony has already been given to the
 
07:22:22.070 --> 07:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:22:24.468 --> 07:22:24.478 align:start position:0%

my own and I am not speaking on behalf
 
07:22:40.548 --> 07:22:40.558 align:start position:0%
of any organization or group that I

belong to my name is Paul Drager I live
 
07:22:45.788 --> 07:22:45.798 align:start position:0%
in summersworth and my purpose today is
 
07:22:48.308 --> 07:22:48.318 align:start position:0%
to speak in favor of
 
07:22:51.070 --> 07:22:51.080 align:start position:0%
1283 at the end of our respective lives
 
07:22:53.070 --> 07:22:53.080 align:start position:0%
if diagnosed with a terminal illness
 
07:22:55.670 --> 07:22:55.680 align:start position:0%
with a six-month prognosis will we
 
07:22:58.708 --> 07:22:58.718 align:start position:0%
merely be a patient until the end the
 
07:23:02.070 --> 07:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
root word of patient is pator which
 
07:23:05.628 --> 07:23:05.638 align:start position:0%
means to endure suffering or I am
 
07:23:08.388 --> 07:23:08.398 align:start position:0%
suffering we all get just one chance to
 
07:23:11.830 --> 07:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
live and one chance to die this bill
 
07:23:14.750 --> 07:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
asks a not so simple question will we be
 
07:23:16.750 --> 07:23:16.760 align:start position:0%
allowed to die in a manner consistent
 
07:23:19.150 --> 07:23:19.160 align:start position:0%
with the way in which we lived which
 
07:23:21.308 --> 07:23:21.318 align:start position:0%
respects our personal values spiritual
 
07:23:24.270 --> 07:23:24.280 align:start position:0%
beliefs cultural background and preser
 
07:23:27.110 --> 07:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
and preserves our dignity do we get to
 
07:23:30.308 --> 07:23:30.318 align:start position:0%
write the final chapter of our story or
 
07:23:33.830 --> 07:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
must we be a patient until the end I've
 
07:23:35.388 --> 07:23:35.398 align:start position:0%
been involved with end of life matters
 
07:23:38.270 --> 07:23:38.280 align:start position:0%
and an advocate for paliative care since
 
07:23:41.110 --> 07:23:41.120 align:start position:0%
1995 serving on hospital and hospice
 
07:23:43.788 --> 07:23:43.798 align:start position:0%
bioethics committees teaching Physicians
 
07:23:46.030 --> 07:23:46.040 align:start position:0%
Medical students and other health care
 
07:23:48.830 --> 07:23:48.840 align:start position:0%
providers I was a member of the 2013
 
07:23:50.868 --> 07:23:50.878 align:start position:0%
legislative study Commission on
 
07:23:53.430 --> 07:23:53.440 align:start position:0%
paliative care and Associated qual
 
07:23:56.388 --> 07:23:56.398 align:start position:0%
quality of life initiatives an
 
07:23:58.270 --> 07:23:58.280 align:start position:0%
individual's end of Life Choices should
 
07:24:01.270 --> 07:24:01.280 align:start position:0%
be broad rather than Limited in scope
 
07:24:05.190 --> 07:24:05.200 align:start position:0%
dying is hard work one's decisions
 
07:24:06.990 --> 07:24:07.000 align:start position:0%
concerning end of life should be based
 
07:24:10.030 --> 07:24:10.040 align:start position:0%
on the very values beliefs goals and
 
07:24:12.868 --> 07:24:12.878 align:start position:0%
life lived in the of the individual
 
07:24:14.628 --> 07:24:14.638 align:start position:0%
rather than arbitrary and judgment
 
07:24:16.948 --> 07:24:16.958 align:start position:0%
mental beliefs of strangers who would
 
07:24:19.228 --> 07:24:19.238 align:start position:0%
impose their values and beliefs on
 
07:24:21.388 --> 07:24:21.398 align:start position:0%
another what may be right for the
 
07:24:24.190 --> 07:24:24.200 align:start position:0%
individual patient facing imminent death
 
07:24:26.990 --> 07:24:27.000 align:start position:0%
may not be right for another in the same
 
07:24:29.708 --> 07:24:29.718 align:start position:0%
situation this is not a time when one
 
07:24:32.510 --> 07:24:32.520 align:start position:0%
size fits all rather it is where an
 
07:24:34.190 --> 07:24:34.200 align:start position:0%
individual's preferences for their
 
07:24:37.510 --> 07:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
unique POS uh situation should Prevail
 
07:24:40.030 --> 07:24:40.040 align:start position:0%
limiting end of Life Choices is unfair
 
07:24:43.430 --> 07:24:43.440 align:start position:0%
and burdensome to such individuals we
 
07:24:45.228 --> 07:24:45.238 align:start position:0%
have various choices that people may
 
07:24:47.910 --> 07:24:47.920 align:start position:0%
disagree with but they are available and
 
07:24:50.430 --> 07:24:50.440 align:start position:0%
end up doing the same thing we have
 
07:24:52.948 --> 07:24:52.958 align:start position:0%
pallative sedation also known as
 
07:24:55.510 --> 07:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
terminal sedation we have the right over
 
07:24:57.150 --> 07:24:57.160 align:start position:0%
here can I just ask you to sum up if you
 
07:25:00.150 --> 07:25:00.160 align:start position:0%
would please sir okay uh in essence what
 
07:25:02.990 --> 07:25:03.000 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to say is is that in order to
 
07:25:06.510 --> 07:25:06.520 align:start position:0%
respect the individual they are entitled
 
07:25:09.308 --> 07:25:09.318 align:start position:0%
we are entitled to that final choice to
 
07:25:11.628 --> 07:25:11.638 align:start position:0%
decide how it is that we live and more
 
07:25:14.270 --> 07:25:14.280 align:start position:0%
importantly how we die I would ask each
 
07:25:16.708 --> 07:25:16.718 align:start position:0%
and individual here every member here to
 
07:25:18.430 --> 07:25:18.440 align:start position:0%
take a look at the poem that I have at
 
07:25:21.350 --> 07:25:21.360 align:start position:0%
the end of my written statements it is
 
07:25:24.670 --> 07:25:24.680 align:start position:0%
read to the Cadence of the 23rd psalm I
 
07:25:26.350 --> 07:25:26.360 align:start position:0%
think that pretty much sums up this
 
07:25:28.868 --> 07:25:28.878 align:start position:0%
entire situation I would encourage you
 
07:25:34.750 --> 07:25:34.760 align:start position:0%
all to please uh accept uh Bill 1283
 
07:25:37.628 --> 07:25:37.638 align:start position:0%

Jackson I think this is on thank you my
 
07:26:03.708 --> 07:26:03.718 align:start position:0%
name is Maryann Jackson I'm a retired
 
07:26:07.788 --> 07:26:07.798 align:start position:0%
OBGYN that practiced from 1984 to 2010
 
07:26:11.110 --> 07:26:11.120 align:start position:0%
up in Carol County and Coos County and
 
07:26:13.228 --> 07:26:13.238 align:start position:0%
was involved in the care uh through my
 
07:26:14.948 --> 07:26:14.958 align:start position:0%
GYN practice of
 
07:26:18.110 --> 07:26:18.120 align:start position:0%
several uh wives sisters and mothers who
 
07:26:20.670 --> 07:26:20.680 align:start position:0%
had endstage ovarian endometrial and
 
07:26:20.680 --> 07:26:21.750 align:start position:0%
had endstage ovarian endometrial and
cervical

07:26:21.750 --> 07:26:21.760 align:start position:0%
cervical
 
07:26:24.468 --> 07:26:24.478 align:start position:0%
cancer one of the things that struck me
 
07:26:28.110 --> 07:26:28.120 align:start position:0%
as most painful was when someone with a
 
07:26:31.388 --> 07:26:31.398 align:start position:0%
bowel obstruction was no longer as
 
07:26:33.750 --> 07:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
you've heard many times able to be
 
07:26:36.270 --> 07:26:36.280 align:start position:0%
reached comfortably with paliative and
 
07:26:39.628 --> 07:26:39.638 align:start position:0%
hospice care that we used re liberally I
 
07:26:42.670 --> 07:26:42.680 align:start position:0%
believe firmly in hospital in excuse me
 
07:26:45.308 --> 07:26:45.318 align:start position:0%
hospice and paliative care it's just
 
07:26:47.628 --> 07:26:47.638 align:start position:0%
that there are limits and when patients
 
07:26:50.510 --> 07:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
would beg me for something that would
 
07:26:53.510 --> 07:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
hasten their death I felt extremely
 
07:26:55.990 --> 07:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable that I had no alternative
 
07:26:58.468 --> 07:26:58.478 align:start position:0%
and nothing that I could do for them and
 
07:27:01.308 --> 07:27:01.318 align:start position:0%
it felt that I was now the person
 
07:27:04.228 --> 07:27:04.238 align:start position:0%
between them and their God this was a
 
07:27:06.468 --> 07:27:06.478 align:start position:0%
God that They begged to be able to be
 
07:27:09.150 --> 07:27:09.160 align:start position:0%
with who they trusted and they loved and
 
07:27:11.628 --> 07:27:11.638 align:start position:0%
they want felt was there to reach out to
 
07:27:15.350 --> 07:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
them and I was prolonging this life
 
07:27:18.510 --> 07:27:18.520 align:start position:0%
for them and I want to say to you I do
 
07:27:20.990 --> 07:27:21.000 align:start position:0%
not think it's conscionable that
 
07:27:24.468 --> 07:27:24.478 align:start position:0%
Physicians can prescribe terminal coma
 
07:27:28.308 --> 07:27:28.318 align:start position:0%
paliative sedation to Coma or assist in
 
07:27:32.150 --> 07:27:32.160 align:start position:0%
the um cessation of eating and drinking
 
07:27:35.388 --> 07:27:35.398 align:start position:0%
for weeks for a patient but yet not
 
07:27:37.228 --> 07:27:37.238 align:start position:0%
beable to prescribe for them the
 
07:27:39.308 --> 07:27:39.318 align:start position:0%
medications that are gives them the
 
07:27:42.110 --> 07:27:42.120 align:start position:0%
option for the death that is the
 
07:27:45.070 --> 07:27:45.080 align:start position:0%
inevitable outcome either way and I
 
07:27:48.110 --> 07:27:48.120 align:start position:0%
believe that we are um missing that
 
07:27:50.868 --> 07:27:50.878 align:start position:0%
Humane alternative and that this is a
 
07:27:54.868 --> 07:27:54.878 align:start position:0%
bill with very clear eligibility
 
07:27:57.750 --> 07:27:57.760 align:start position:0%
criteria it can be followed to the
 
07:28:02.670 --> 07:28:02.680 align:start position:0%
letter it is not ambiguous it is very
 
07:28:04.910 --> 07:28:04.920 align:start position:0%
robust in the ways in which the
 
07:28:07.468 --> 07:28:07.478 align:start position:0%
Physicians have to be be able
 
07:28:11.150 --> 07:28:11.160 align:start position:0%
to um assess for someone's terminal
 
07:28:13.708 --> 07:28:13.718 align:start position:0%
illness not disability this is not
 
07:28:13.718 --> 07:28:14.788 align:start position:0%
illness not disability this is not
suicide

07:28:14.788 --> 07:28:14.798 align:start position:0%
suicide
 
07:28:17.788 --> 07:28:17.798 align:start position:0%
this is relief and I believe strongly in
 
07:28:19.388 --> 07:28:19.398 align:start position:0%
in support for
 
07:28:22.868 --> 07:28:22.878 align:start position:0%

testimony which describes uh how I was
 
07:28:45.990 --> 07:28:46.000 align:start position:0%
sitting as a legislator here when my
 
07:28:47.948 --> 07:28:47.958 align:start position:0%
husband died which is why I'm doing this
 
07:28:50.830 --> 07:28:50.840 align:start position:0%
work now my husband who was an Army
 
07:28:52.990 --> 07:28:53.000 align:start position:0%
veteran who did not have this
 
07:28:55.948 --> 07:28:55.958 align:start position:0%
option and I would like to offer just
 
07:28:58.270 --> 07:28:58.280 align:start position:0%
very quickly the four people who had to
 
07:29:01.788 --> 07:29:01.798 align:start position:0%
leave and um and and submit their
 
07:29:04.788 --> 07:29:04.798 align:start position:0%
testimony uh first is Kevin lucer MD

from Portsmith 40 years as a surgeon who
 
07:29:11.190 --> 07:29:11.200 align:start position:0%
is very clearly in favor of this bill
 
07:29:13.030 --> 07:29:13.040 align:start position:0%
for many of the same reasons that Dr
 
07:29:16.110 --> 07:29:16.120 align:start position:0%
Jackson just explained BL uh second is a
 
07:29:19.110 --> 07:29:19.120 align:start position:0%

who also affirms everything that Dr
 
07:29:31.990 --> 07:29:32.000 align:start position:0%
Jackson just said about needing this as
 
07:29:34.788 --> 07:29:34.798 align:start position:0%
part of her toolbox and her Continuum of
 
07:29:36.510 --> 07:29:36.520 align:start position:0%
Care for end of life
 
07:29:39.948 --> 07:29:39.958 align:start position:0%

07:29:54.070 --> 07:29:54.080 align:start position:0%
says because of my strokes and now
 
07:29:55.948 --> 07:29:55.958 align:start position:0%
living with brain injuries I have lost
 
07:29:57.670 --> 07:29:57.680 align:start position:0%
some of my autonomy and some of the
 
07:30:00.468 --> 07:30:00.478 align:start position:0%
control over my own life I know at this
 
07:30:02.430 --> 07:30:02.440 align:start position:0%
point I have enough parts of my brain
 
07:30:04.910 --> 07:30:04.920 align:start position:0%
working that if needed I want to have
 
07:30:06.830 --> 07:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
control over and the same rights to
 
07:30:09.150 --> 07:30:09.160 align:start position:0%
determine my end of life if I have a
 
07:30:12.308 --> 07:30:12.318 align:start position:0%
terminal condition as any non-disabled
 
07:30:14.788 --> 07:30:14.798 align:start position:0%
person would
 
07:30:16.750 --> 07:30:16.760 align:start position:0%
and she was exposed to covid so couldn't
 
07:30:17.708 --> 07:30:17.718 align:start position:0%
be here
 
07:30:21.628 --> 07:30:21.638 align:start position:0%
today and finally from Bonnie uh Leva
 
07:30:24.708 --> 07:30:24.718 align:start position:0%
from Portsmith whose husband Frank
 
07:30:29.350 --> 07:30:29.360 align:start position:0%
suffered from brain cancer actually did
 
07:30:32.868 --> 07:30:32.878 align:start position:0%
qualify with his first trip to Vermont
 
07:30:35.308 --> 07:30:35.318 align:start position:0%
for Medical Aid and dying but died
 
07:30:39.030 --> 07:30:39.040 align:start position:0%
before he was able to uh get back all
 
07:30:41.308 --> 07:30:41.318 align:start position:0%
the way up to St Johnsbury from
 
07:30:44.150 --> 07:30:44.160 align:start position:0%
Portsmith for his second who fervently
 
07:30:47.830 --> 07:30:47.840 align:start position:0%
wanted Medical Aid and Dy and shared his
 
07:30:51.270 --> 07:30:51.280 align:start position:0%
stories for the year and a half uh after
 
07:30:53.350 --> 07:30:53.360 align:start position:0%
he contacted our organization the New
 
07:30:54.830 --> 07:30:54.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Alliance for end of life
 
07:30:58.510 --> 07:30:58.520 align:start position:0%
options of which I'm a director to tell
 
07:31:03.228 --> 07:31:03.238 align:start position:0%
his story in detail about the kinds of
 
07:31:06.350 --> 07:31:06.360 align:start position:0%
questions and the the finality of
 
07:31:09.590 --> 07:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
knowing that even though the option did
 
07:31:12.430 --> 07:31:12.440 align:start position:0%
exist in Vermont that he'd have to leave
 
07:31:17.510 --> 07:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
home in order to use it and as Bonnie
 
07:31:19.830 --> 07:31:19.840 align:start position:0%
says at the end of her testimony let me
 
07:31:26.110 --> 07:31:26.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:31:28.830 --> 07:31:28.840 align:start position:0%

for so many people people Frank's words
 
07:31:48.628 --> 07:31:48.638 align:start position:0%
were I've lived as a free person in New
 
07:31:52.670 --> 07:31:52.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I want the freedom to die as
 
07:31:55.990 --> 07:31:56.000 align:start position:0%
well and thank you for your listening
 
07:31:58.548 --> 07:31:58.558 align:start position:0%
today uh we've learned a lot from
 
07:32:01.990 --> 07:32:02.000 align:start position:0%
testimony we um are eager to work with
 
07:32:05.388 --> 07:32:05.398 align:start position:0%
you on for instance the pharmacists uh
 
07:32:07.270 --> 07:32:07.280 align:start position:0%
points that were raised earlier and
 
07:32:09.070 --> 07:32:09.080 align:start position:0%
anything else that the committee would
 
07:32:11.308 --> 07:32:11.318 align:start position:0%
like to engage in to make this the best
 
07:32:13.388 --> 07:32:13.398 align:start position:0%
bill for New Hampshire so thank you
 
07:32:15.910 --> 07:32:15.920 align:start position:0%
thank you questions for this witness
 
07:32:19.308 --> 07:32:19.318 align:start position:0%
seeing none uh Betsy McConnell and next
 
07:32:24.110 --> 07:32:24.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:32:26.430 --> 07:32:26.440 align:start position:0%
McGinley I don't know she's
 
07:32:39.948 --> 07:32:39.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:32:43.228 --> 07:32:43.238 align:start position:0%
those no I don't see her here you've
 
07:32:46.708 --> 07:32:46.718 align:start position:0%
heard from so many people already I I
 
07:32:48.110 --> 07:32:48.120 align:start position:0%
fear I may be
 
07:32:51.948 --> 07:32:51.958 align:start position:0%
redundant um I'm so grateful for your
 
07:32:55.990 --> 07:32:56.000 align:start position:0%
patience in listening to all of us today
 
07:32:57.830 --> 07:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
and it occurs to me that we have very
 
07:33:00.830 --> 07:33:00.840 align:start position:0%
few opportunities to talk about dying
 
07:33:03.990 --> 07:33:04.000 align:start position:0%
and deal with the reality of death and
 
07:33:06.990 --> 07:33:07.000 align:start position:0%
we've we've heard a lot of
 
07:33:09.628 --> 07:33:09.638 align:start position:0%
fear a lot of fear of Social and
 
07:33:09.638 --> 07:33:10.910 align:start position:0%
fear a lot of fear of Social and
cultural

07:33:10.910 --> 07:33:10.920 align:start position:0%
cultural
 
07:33:15.030 --> 07:33:15.040 align:start position:0%
erosion from um devaluing life
 
07:33:16.708 --> 07:33:16.718 align:start position:0%
and there's been a lot of fear about
 
07:33:19.070 --> 07:33:19.080 align:start position:0%
that and fear that that if Medical Aid
 
07:33:22.308 --> 07:33:22.318 align:start position:0%
and dying is available it
 
07:33:26.350 --> 07:33:26.360 align:start position:0%
will it will make life um less worth
 
07:33:29.110 --> 07:33:29.120 align:start position:0%
living for categories of
 
07:33:31.468 --> 07:33:31.478 align:start position:0%
people but the reason this bill is
 
07:33:35.670 --> 07:33:35.680 align:start position:0%
before you is because of the profound
 
07:33:38.228 --> 07:33:38.238 align:start position:0%
Agony many people go through at this
 
07:33:40.548 --> 07:33:40.558 align:start position:0%
point and you've heard many many stories
 
07:33:40.558 --> 07:33:42.030 align:start position:0%
point and you've heard many many stories
of

07:33:42.030 --> 07:33:42.040 align:start position:0%
of
 
07:33:45.788 --> 07:33:45.798 align:start position:0%
that I have uh practiced as a clinical
 
07:33:49.030 --> 07:33:49.040 align:start position:0%
social worker for 33 years in
 
07:33:50.910 --> 07:33:50.920 align:start position:0%
Connecticut New York Washington
 
07:33:53.070 --> 07:33:53.080 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania and
 
07:33:55.308 --> 07:33:55.318 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and over that time I
 
07:33:57.468 --> 07:33:57.478 align:start position:0%
observed how challenging this can be for
 
07:34:00.270 --> 07:34:00.280 align:start position:0%
people to come to terms with we just
 
07:34:02.670 --> 07:34:02.680 align:start position:0%
have a very deep cultural problem in our
 
07:34:04.548 --> 07:34:04.558 align:start position:0%
inability to cope with
 
07:34:07.110 --> 07:34:07.120 align:start position:0%
death I saw this firsthand when my
 
07:34:08.868 --> 07:34:08.878 align:start position:0%
younger sister was diagnosed with
 
07:34:08.878 --> 07:34:10.468 align:start position:0%
younger sister was diagnosed with
cervical

07:34:10.468 --> 07:34:10.478 align:start position:0%
cervical
 
07:34:13.670 --> 07:34:13.680 align:start position:0%
cancer she fought the cancer she she AG
 
07:34:15.830 --> 07:34:15.840 align:start position:0%
aggressively fought the cancer and
 
07:34:19.350 --> 07:34:19.360 align:start position:0%
believed that she was curable and died
 
07:34:21.830 --> 07:34:21.840 align:start position:0%
in 2 years with horrible
 
07:34:24.228 --> 07:34:24.238 align:start position:0%
suffering I believe what this bill can
 
07:34:27.750 --> 07:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
do is begin a process for opening a
 
07:34:30.510 --> 07:34:30.520 align:start position:0%
space for people to decide how they
 
07:34:33.788 --> 07:34:33.798 align:start position:0%
would like to live their death right now
 
07:34:36.590 --> 07:34:36.600 align:start position:0%
there's a a way in which people are
 
07:34:37.708 --> 07:34:37.718 align:start position:0%
given a
 
07:34:39.910 --> 07:34:39.920 align:start position:0%
diagnosis and there's a great deal of
 
07:34:42.628 --> 07:34:42.638 align:start position:0%
panic and also lack of knowledge of
 
07:34:44.468 --> 07:34:44.478 align:start position:0%
cancer let's say
 
07:34:44.478 --> 07:34:45.590 align:start position:0%
cancer let's say
and

07:34:45.590 --> 07:34:45.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:34:50.030 --> 07:34:50.040 align:start position:0%
they're uh often really
 
07:34:54.388 --> 07:34:54.398 align:start position:0%
uh incapable of coping well with that I
 
07:34:56.150 --> 07:34:56.160 align:start position:0%
thought a lot about the the term the
 
07:34:58.030 --> 07:34:58.040 align:start position:0%
sanctity of
 
07:35:00.590 --> 07:35:00.600 align:start position:0%
life and it's something I believe in as
 
07:35:02.468 --> 07:35:02.478 align:start position:0%
a good
 
07:35:04.788 --> 07:35:04.798 align:start position:0%
Episcopalian but I don't think that it's
 
07:35:08.110 --> 07:35:08.120 align:start position:0%
well represented when a person's only
 
07:35:10.948 --> 07:35:10.958 align:start position:0%
choice is to pursue every possible
 
07:35:13.868 --> 07:35:13.878 align:start position:0%
medical intervention ending in hospital
 
07:35:17.110 --> 07:35:17.120 align:start position:0%
care or voluntarily stopping eating and
 
07:35:19.628 --> 07:35:19.638 align:start position:0%
drinking at least 10 years ago there was
 
07:35:22.308 --> 07:35:22.318 align:start position:0%
an article in the New York Times about
 
07:35:24.228 --> 07:35:24.238 align:start position:0%
how doctors die
 
07:35:27.228 --> 07:35:27.238 align:start position:0%
differently and it said that a lot of
 
07:35:30.868 --> 07:35:30.878 align:start position:0%
medical doctors when given a um a
 
07:35:34.590 --> 07:35:34.600 align:start position:0%
diagnosis did not pursue treatment
 
07:35:36.270 --> 07:35:36.280 align:start position:0%
because they knew what treatment
 
07:35:38.628 --> 07:35:38.638 align:start position:0%
involved can I just ask you to you're
 
07:35:40.110 --> 07:35:40.120 align:start position:0%
kind of over your time if you could just
 
07:35:42.510 --> 07:35:42.520 align:start position:0%
finish up please thank you
 
07:35:42.520 --> 07:35:45.510 align:start position:0%
finish up please thank you
um

07:35:45.510 --> 07:35:45.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:35:48.070 --> 07:35:48.080 align:start position:0%
okay many people are afraid of death and
 
07:35:50.868 --> 07:35:50.878 align:start position:0%
struggle with being mortal when terminal
 
07:35:52.990 --> 07:35:53.000 align:start position:0%
illness comes it can be overwhelming to
 
07:35:55.788 --> 07:35:55.798 align:start position:0%
consider what to do can you imagine for
 
07:35:57.548 --> 07:35:57.558 align:start position:0%
yourself what it would be like and what
 
07:36:00.388 --> 07:36:00.398 align:start position:0%
you might want passing this bill would
 
07:36:02.948 --> 07:36:02.958 align:start position:0%
help people consider their options and
 
07:36:04.868 --> 07:36:04.878 align:start position:0%
Empower them to make a choice when their
 
07:36:07.270 --> 07:36:07.280 align:start position:0%
lives are filled with unmanageable pain
 
07:36:10.308 --> 07:36:10.318 align:start position:0%
and even hospice Aid is limited thank
 
07:36:12.350 --> 07:36:12.360 align:start position:0%
you for considering this legislation
 
07:36:13.708 --> 07:36:13.718 align:start position:0%
thank you questions from for this
 
07:36:16.910 --> 07:36:16.920 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none Shannon
 
07:36:19.190 --> 07:36:19.200 align:start position:0%
McGinley Shannon
 
07:36:31.270 --> 07:36:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:36:34.228 --> 07:36:34.238 align:start position:0%
perrow chairman Lynn committee members
 
07:36:36.990 --> 07:36:37.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for having me here um I
 
07:36:40.190 --> 07:36:40.200 align:start position:0%
submitted um part of my testimony here
 
07:36:42.948 --> 07:36:42.958 align:start position:0%
of which the first paragraph is going to
 
07:36:45.270 --> 07:36:45.280 align:start position:0%
be put in here but I did have some other
 
07:36:48.030 --> 07:36:48.040 align:start position:0%
issues uh with the bill that I think
 
07:36:49.228 --> 07:36:49.238 align:start position:0%
need to be
 
07:36:51.868 --> 07:36:51.878 align:start position:0%
addressed and it covers a number of
 
07:36:51.878 --> 07:36:52.788 align:start position:0%
addressed and it covers a number of
different

07:36:52.788 --> 07:36:52.798 align:start position:0%
different
 
07:36:57.228 --> 07:36:57.238 align:start position:0%
topics um I I find it
 
07:37:00.350 --> 07:37:00.360 align:start position:0%
um a little bit um almost every
 
07:37:02.948 --> 07:37:02.958 align:start position:0%
responsible how how will this bill be
 
07:37:05.350 --> 07:37:05.360 align:start position:0%
monitored and how does it deal with
 
07:37:08.670 --> 07:37:08.680 align:start position:0%
Medicare and Medicaid and the place I'm
 
07:37:12.228 --> 07:37:12.238 align:start position:0%
coming from is you've got people who are
 
07:37:14.628 --> 07:37:14.638 align:start position:0%
marginalized um uh veterans homeless
 
07:37:17.308 --> 07:37:17.318 align:start position:0%
people immigrants verbally challenged
 
07:37:19.590 --> 07:37:19.600 align:start position:0%
linguistically challenged people who
 
07:37:21.868 --> 07:37:21.878 align:start position:0%
have no access or how to go about
 
07:37:24.948 --> 07:37:24.958 align:start position:0%
accessing this type of legislation if
 
07:37:26.868 --> 07:37:26.878 align:start position:0%
you choose to pass this
 
07:37:30.350 --> 07:37:30.360 align:start position:0%
through uh we all know this is a
 
07:37:33.788 --> 07:37:33.798 align:start position:0%
committee goes to the house goes to the
 
07:37:36.628 --> 07:37:36.638 align:start position:0%
Senate goes above and beyond this bill
 
07:37:39.228 --> 07:37:39.238 align:start position:0%
will look nothing like it does right
 
07:37:42.308 --> 07:37:42.318 align:start position:0%
now um I I have
 
07:37:42.318 --> 07:37:44.548 align:start position:0%
now um I I have
a

07:37:44.548 --> 07:37:44.558 align:start position:0%
a
 
07:37:47.270 --> 07:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
I I've seen some things going through my
 
07:37:50.750 --> 07:37:50.760 align:start position:0%
my mom had pocket in for years aspirated
 
07:37:53.388 --> 07:37:53.398 align:start position:0%
and and died in a coma I had a brother
 
07:37:55.990 --> 07:37:56.000 align:start position:0%
had colon cancer went through all this
 
07:37:58.910 --> 07:37:58.920 align:start position:0%
stuff uh some everybody has their own
 
07:38:02.308 --> 07:38:02.318 align:start position:0%
thing my mom suffered for
 
07:38:06.308 --> 07:38:06.318 align:start position:0%
years and you know um she was a very
 
07:38:08.510 --> 07:38:08.520 align:start position:0%
religious person but you know she said
 
07:38:11.990 --> 07:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
she just wanted to to go but my brother
 
07:38:13.830 --> 07:38:13.840 align:start position:0%
was completely the opposite
 
07:38:16.548 --> 07:38:16.558 align:start position:0%
so everybody's the same and my feeling
 
07:38:19.270 --> 07:38:19.280 align:start position:0%
is that looking at what's been going on
 
07:38:23.388 --> 07:38:23.398 align:start position:0%
in this around us in this different
 
07:38:25.670 --> 07:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
atmosphere that we have going on in the
 
07:38:29.910 --> 07:38:29.920 align:start position:0%
country um I'm kind of remissed to give
 
07:38:32.190 --> 07:38:32.200 align:start position:0%
up um a
 
07:38:36.510 --> 07:38:36.520 align:start position:0%
choice to the government as
 
07:38:42.150 --> 07:38:42.160 align:start position:0%
to how I should number one make a choice
 
07:38:44.110 --> 07:38:44.120 align:start position:0%
depending on what the government is
 
07:38:47.110 --> 07:38:47.120 align:start position:0%
going to support and I don't see where
 
07:38:48.628 --> 07:38:48.638 align:start position:0%
anything in this bill says where the
 
07:38:50.868 --> 07:38:50.878 align:start position:0%
support's going to come from Medicare
 
07:38:53.030 --> 07:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
Medicaid for these people especially
 
07:38:53.040 --> 07:38:53.948 align:start position:0%
Medicaid for these people especially
those

07:38:53.948 --> 07:38:53.958 align:start position:0%
those
 
07:38:57.308 --> 07:38:57.318 align:start position:0%
marginally um on the edges I mean I'm a
 
07:38:59.030 --> 07:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
veteran a couple times over I was a
 
07:39:01.910 --> 07:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
flight medic I you I was trained as a a
 
07:39:01.920 --> 07:39:03.350 align:start position:0%
flight medic I you I was trained as a a
bio

07:39:03.350 --> 07:39:03.360 align:start position:0%
bio
 
07:39:06.868 --> 07:39:06.878 align:start position:0%
Anthropologist so um life is different
 
07:39:09.868 --> 07:39:09.878 align:start position:0%
for everybody not everybody's the same
 
07:39:11.190 --> 07:39:11.200 align:start position:0%
and I think we have to take into
 
07:39:12.830 --> 07:39:12.840 align:start position:0%
consideration how these people going to
 
07:39:12.840 --> 07:39:14.430 align:start position:0%
consideration how these people going to
access

07:39:14.430 --> 07:39:14.440 align:start position:0%
access
 
07:39:17.350 --> 07:39:17.360 align:start position:0%
any of this stuff in whatever form it
 
07:39:18.830 --> 07:39:18.840 align:start position:0%
ends up coming
 
07:39:22.548 --> 07:39:22.558 align:start position:0%
before the vote here to pass it on the
 
07:39:25.948 --> 07:39:25.958 align:start position:0%
Senate and at the next stage I I don't
 
07:39:29.030 --> 07:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
want to see this open up as a as a a
 
07:39:32.750 --> 07:39:32.760 align:start position:0%
will with all to end with all all right
 
07:39:35.590 --> 07:39:35.600 align:start position:0%
questions for this witness seeing none
 
07:39:37.510 --> 07:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much sir you welcome
 
07:39:37.520 --> 07:39:42.150 align:start position:0%
thank you very much sir you welcome
Robert

07:39:42.150 --> 07:39:42.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:39:42.160 --> 07:39:45.430 align:start position:0%
 
tangway

07:39:45.430 --> 07:39:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:39:49.070 --> 07:39:49.080 align:start position:0%
I still have some life in me um my name
 
07:39:52.590 --> 07:39:52.600 align:start position:0%
is Robert tangue I I spoke earlier um I
 
07:39:56.308 --> 07:39:56.318 align:start position:0%
think that these I'm a I'm for this bill
 
07:39:58.590 --> 07:39:58.600 align:start position:0%
um this bill is already in law when you
 
07:40:00.228 --> 07:40:00.238 align:start position:0%
read article two of the New Hampshire
 
07:40:03.270 --> 07:40:03.280 align:start position:0%
Constitution which is the supreme law we
 
07:40:08.350 --> 07:40:08.360 align:start position:0%
have a right to our Liberty to live and
 
07:40:10.830 --> 07:40:10.840 align:start position:0%
also to Aid others these are rights and
 
07:40:12.830 --> 07:40:12.840 align:start position:0%
our property and you'll find that when a
 
07:40:16.150 --> 07:40:16.160 align:start position:0%
lot of people are opposed to this bill
 
07:40:17.868 --> 07:40:17.878 align:start position:0%
you're going to see that the reason why
 
07:40:19.750 --> 07:40:19.760 align:start position:0%
they're opposed to it is because of
 
07:40:21.910 --> 07:40:21.920 align:start position:0%
Technology they make money off of it
 
07:40:25.110 --> 07:40:25.120 align:start position:0%
keeping people alive suffering we have a
 
07:40:28.150 --> 07:40:28.160 align:start position:0%
choice in our life in our
 
07:40:31.350 --> 07:40:31.360 align:start position:0%
children God gave us these
 
07:40:35.070 --> 07:40:35.080 align:start position:0%
rights not the Constitution not our
 
07:40:38.070 --> 07:40:38.080 align:start position:0%
humble servants which I respect you all
 
07:40:41.590 --> 07:40:41.600 align:start position:0%
gave us these rights to live our life
 
07:40:44.070 --> 07:40:44.080 align:start position:0%
and to end our lives
 
07:40:47.308 --> 07:40:47.318 align:start position:0%
if we need be this is this bill right
 
07:40:53.388 --> 07:40:53.398 align:start position:0%
 
07:40:57.350 --> 07:40:57.360 align:start position:0%
are going to die there is also a choice
 
07:41:01.110 --> 07:41:01.120 align:start position:0%
with the doctors to not approve this
 
07:41:03.070 --> 07:41:03.080 align:start position:0%
they we all have free will we all have
 
07:41:04.990 --> 07:41:05.000 align:start position:0%
free will to make any decision a police
 
07:41:06.628 --> 07:41:06.638 align:start position:0%
officer can be ordered to arrest someone
 
07:41:08.670 --> 07:41:08.680 align:start position:0%
they can choose not to and so that's how
 
07:41:11.468 --> 07:41:11.478 align:start position:0%
that works I also wanted to bring up so
 
07:41:13.190 --> 07:41:13.200 align:start position:0%
article two of the New Hampshire cons
 
07:41:15.548 --> 07:41:15.558 align:start position:0%
stitution and then
 
07:41:18.510 --> 07:41:18.520 align:start position:0%
also uh the dignity that this allows
 
07:41:22.388 --> 07:41:22.398 align:start position:0%
people to choose to go in there own way
 
07:41:24.670 --> 07:41:24.680 align:start position:0%
with dignity with their family at a time
 
07:41:26.948 --> 07:41:26.958 align:start position:0%
that they choose to at a time not
 
07:41:26.958 --> 07:41:29.030 align:start position:0%
that they choose to at a time not
suffering

07:41:29.030 --> 07:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
suffering
 
07:41:32.548 --> 07:41:32.558 align:start position:0%
suffocating it death can be very scary
 
07:41:35.628 --> 07:41:35.638 align:start position:0%
um I'd also like to bring up Eugenics
 
07:41:36.868 --> 07:41:36.878 align:start position:0%
and please let me know if I start to go
 
07:41:38.590 --> 07:41:38.600 align:start position:0%
over my time you're got you're very
 
07:41:41.948 --> 07:41:41.958 align:start position:0%
close you're about to go over Eugenics
 
07:41:44.150 --> 07:41:44.160 align:start position:0%
is the four step ization it was passed
 
07:41:48.788 --> 07:41:48.798 align:start position:0%
into law in New Hampshire and 32 states
 
07:41:50.388 --> 07:41:50.398 align:start position:0%
the last Eugenics
 
07:41:52.670 --> 07:41:52.680 align:start position:0%
law this is forced
 
07:41:55.670 --> 07:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
sterilization was in 2014 was removed
 
07:41:58.548 --> 07:41:58.558 align:start position:0%
from the books all
 
07:42:01.548 --> 07:42:01.558 align:start position:0%
right the Constitution protects us from
 
07:42:04.670 --> 07:42:04.680 align:start position:0%
the government from intruding upon our
 
07:42:07.190 --> 07:42:07.200 align:start position:0%
decisions as free citizens that's why
 
07:42:08.388 --> 07:42:08.398 align:start position:0%
it's already in law and I would
 
07:42:09.948 --> 07:42:09.958 align:start position:0%
appreciate if you guys would move this
 
07:42:09.958 --> 07:42:11.190 align:start position:0%
appreciate if you guys would move this
forward

07:42:11.190 --> 07:42:11.200 align:start position:0%
forward
 
07:42:14.590 --> 07:42:14.600 align:start position:0%
to codify
 
07:42:16.830 --> 07:42:16.840 align:start position:0%
A system that is clear for someone to
 
07:42:20.308 --> 07:42:20.318 align:start position:0%
take care of their own matters all right
 
07:42:22.150 --> 07:42:22.160 align:start position:0%
thank you questions for this witness
 
07:42:24.548 --> 07:42:24.558 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chair and thank you to all

of the committee members who
 
07:42:58.270 --> 07:42:58.280 align:start position:0%
uh have stuck it through uh this has
 
07:43:00.548 --> 07:43:00.558 align:start position:0%
been a very long day even with the
 
07:43:03.548 --> 07:43:03.558 align:start position:0%
intermission my name is Mary Smith I'm
 
07:43:06.030 --> 07:43:06.040 align:start position:0%
from Manchester New
 
07:43:09.750 --> 07:43:09.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I'm here uh to testify in
 
07:43:11.270 --> 07:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
support of this
 
07:43:14.708 --> 07:43:14.718 align:start position:0%
bill um
 
07:43:19.110 --> 07:43:19.120 align:start position:0%
I uh also want to thank uh you
 
07:43:20.628 --> 07:43:20.638 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn and you
 
07:43:23.468 --> 07:43:23.478 align:start position:0%
representative Smith for being sponsors
 
07:43:24.430 --> 07:43:24.440 align:start position:0%
on this
 
07:43:29.110 --> 07:43:29.120 align:start position:0%
bill um I don't know if you had already
 
07:43:33.910 --> 07:43:33.920 align:start position:0%
testified uh Mr Lynn but uh if you
 
07:43:35.830 --> 07:43:35.840 align:start position:0%
haven't testified on this bill I'm sure
 
07:43:37.948 --> 07:43:37.958 align:start position:0%
there are interesting things and
 
07:43:39.430 --> 07:43:39.440 align:start position:0%
relevant things that you would be able
 
07:43:42.070 --> 07:43:42.080 align:start position:0%
to say about uh how the case law in New
 
07:43:46.830 --> 07:43:46.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire if it at all um interacts with
 
07:43:51.270 --> 07:43:51.280 align:start position:0%
um the contents of this bill um but as
 
07:43:54.228 --> 07:43:54.238 align:start position:0%
to uh myself and my personal testimony
 
07:43:56.388 --> 07:43:56.398 align:start position:0%
well I don't normally like uh testifying
 
07:43:58.430 --> 07:43:58.440 align:start position:0%
on bills that have huge
 
07:44:02.510 --> 07:44:02.520 align:start position:0%
crowds because I find that it isn't uh
 
07:44:05.350 --> 07:44:05.360 align:start position:0%
hugely useful usually if a large crowd
 
07:44:07.308 --> 07:44:07.318 align:start position:0%
comes out all of the representatives
 
07:44:10.030 --> 07:44:10.040 align:start position:0%
have decided how they're going to uh
 
07:44:13.590 --> 07:44:13.600 align:start position:0%
recommend uh the bill to go
 
07:44:17.708 --> 07:44:17.718 align:start position:0%
um but uh I did want to use this
 
07:44:20.948 --> 07:44:20.958 align:start position:0%
opportunity to touch on points that um I
 
07:44:23.948 --> 07:44:23.958 align:start position:0%
thought were not addressed or that I did
 
07:44:29.468 --> 07:44:29.478 align:start position:0%
not hear uh earlier which includes that
 
07:44:29.478 --> 07:44:32.150 align:start position:0%
not hear uh earlier which includes that
um

07:44:32.150 --> 07:44:32.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:44:35.910 --> 07:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
the way that these sorts of cases have
 
07:44:38.030 --> 07:44:38.040 align:start position:0%
been handled
 
07:44:40.750 --> 07:44:40.760 align:start position:0%
historically um hasn't been a
 
07:44:43.510 --> 07:44:43.520 align:start position:0%
perspective that I've heard yet where
 
07:44:47.388 --> 07:44:47.398 align:start position:0%
uh we live in extremely privileged times
 
07:44:50.788 --> 07:44:50.798 align:start position:0%
um to be able to access uh the
 
07:44:54.110 --> 07:44:54.120 align:start position:0%
treatments that we can and that in the
 
07:44:58.468 --> 07:44:58.478 align:start position:0%
past um when individuals uh made this
 
07:45:00.270 --> 07:45:00.280 align:start position:0%
made these sorts of decisions for
 
07:45:02.430 --> 07:45:02.440 align:start position:0%
themselves uh and decided it was the
 
07:45:07.270 --> 07:45:07.280 align:start position:0%
time to go that um their Physicians if
 
07:45:10.548 --> 07:45:10.558 align:start position:0%
they had Physicians uh would sometimes
 
07:45:15.228 --> 07:45:15.238 align:start position:0%
uh give them more more medicine than uh
 
07:45:18.228 --> 07:45:18.238 align:start position:0%
is necessary for treating in onless or
 
07:45:22.350 --> 07:45:22.360 align:start position:0%
that their um loved ones would in acting
 
07:45:27.708 --> 07:45:27.718 align:start position:0%
with their best wishes um remove uh or
 
07:45:32.670 --> 07:45:32.680 align:start position:0%
or or withhold um any uh medications for
 
07:45:34.388 --> 07:45:34.398 align:start position:0%
conditions that they have in order to
 
07:45:37.750 --> 07:45:37.760 align:start position:0%
assist them in this and uh that I mean
 
07:45:39.948 --> 07:45:39.958 align:start position:0%
that is the reality of the world we live
 
07:45:43.030 --> 07:45:43.040 align:start position:0%
in in many different countries uh not
 
07:45:47.270 --> 07:45:47.280 align:start position:0%
this one um because people overwhelming
 
07:45:49.708 --> 07:45:49.718 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to pursue different
 
07:45:52.990 --> 07:45:53.000 align:start position:0%
means um and they do uh unfortunately
 
07:45:55.868 --> 07:45:55.878 align:start position:0%
and hopefully with this bill passing um
 
07:46:00.708 --> 07:46:00.718 align:start position:0%
they will have means that are um more
 
07:46:04.228 --> 07:46:04.238 align:start position:0%
Humane than we have had uh in the past
 
07:46:06.070 --> 07:46:06.080 align:start position:0%
um and uh one other thing before I go
 
07:46:08.070 --> 07:46:08.080 align:start position:0%
over time you've been very generous to
 
07:46:10.150 --> 07:46:10.160 align:start position:0%
everybody who's uh been up here and I
 
07:46:13.190 --> 07:46:13.200 align:start position:0%
really appreciate it um and I don't know
 
07:46:17.030 --> 07:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
if your uh fellow committee members will
 
07:46:19.070 --> 07:46:19.080 align:start position:0%
appreciate it as much that you have been
 
07:46:21.510 --> 07:46:21.520 align:start position:0%
able to give a little more lenience on
 
07:46:25.190 --> 07:46:25.200 align:start position:0%
the two-minute rule but uh I also wanted
 
07:46:27.628 --> 07:46:27.638 align:start position:0%
to mention that there are people who are
 
07:46:30.830 --> 07:46:30.840 align:start position:0%
interested in dying um and who would be
 
07:46:33.548 --> 07:46:33.558 align:start position:0%
interested in the options as you've
 
07:46:37.590 --> 07:46:37.600 align:start position:0%
supported in this bill um for reasons
 
07:46:40.350 --> 07:46:40.360 align:start position:0%
not including to end their life that
 
07:46:43.350 --> 07:46:43.360 align:start position:0%
they want to
 
07:46:45.788 --> 07:46:45.798 align:start position:0%
pursue the methods as outlined in this
 
07:46:48.228 --> 07:46:48.238 align:start position:0%
bill so that they may be cryogenically
 
07:46:51.868 --> 07:46:51.878 align:start position:0%
frozen and resuscitated later where
 
07:46:55.708 --> 07:46:55.718 align:start position:0%
there are um Technologies available to
 
07:46:58.910 --> 07:46:58.920 align:start position:0%
deal with whatever U medical issues that
 
07:47:00.948 --> 07:47:00.958 align:start position:0%
they are that are currently
 
07:47:04.388 --> 07:47:04.398 align:start position:0%
intractable and so it's just another
 
07:47:07.308 --> 07:47:07.318 align:start position:0%
unusual uh aspect that interacts with
 
07:47:08.830 --> 07:47:08.840 align:start position:0%
this bill that I didn't hear people
 
07:47:11.868 --> 07:47:11.878 align:start position:0%
comment on uh thank you very much for
 
07:47:14.830 --> 07:47:14.840 align:start position:0%
your patience questions for this witness
 
07:47:16.670 --> 07:47:16.680 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much sir is
 
07:47:18.628 --> 07:47:18.638 align:start position:0%

07:47:26.388 --> 07:47:26.398 align:start position:0%
1283 I'm Sorry Miss McGinley I called

07:47:55.510 --> 07:47:55.520 align:start position:0%
1283 we believe that caring and not
 
07:47:57.190 --> 07:47:57.200 align:start position:0%
killing is the right approach when ever
 
07:47:59.388 --> 07:47:59.398 align:start position:0%
faced with illness or disability whether
 
07:48:02.548 --> 07:48:02.558 align:start position:0%
terminal or not whether acute or chronic
 
07:48:04.548 --> 07:48:04.558 align:start position:0%
this bill tries to lead public policy in
 
07:48:06.190 --> 07:48:06.200 align:start position:0%
the wrong direction by fostering the
 
07:48:08.990 --> 07:48:09.000 align:start position:0%
legalization of suicide the sponsors of
 
07:48:11.548 --> 07:48:11.558 align:start position:0%
the bill avoid saying suicide choosing
 
07:48:12.990 --> 07:48:13.000 align:start position:0%
instead words like like death With
 
07:48:16.110 --> 07:48:16.120 align:start position:0%
Dignity patient directed care autonomy
 
07:48:18.590 --> 07:48:18.600 align:start position:0%
and end of life decisions no matter how
 
07:48:20.590 --> 07:48:20.600 align:start position:0%
they mince the words the bill clearly
 
07:48:22.788 --> 07:48:22.798 align:start position:0%
authorizes State sanctioned suicide with
 
07:48:25.150 --> 07:48:25.160 align:start position:0%
lethal drug prescriptions and defines it
 
07:48:27.788 --> 07:48:27.798 align:start position:0%
as typical Medical Care this is not
 
07:48:29.350 --> 07:48:29.360 align:start position:0%
authentic compassion for anyone
 
07:48:31.308 --> 07:48:31.318 align:start position:0%
suffering from terminal illness
 
07:48:33.270 --> 07:48:33.280 align:start position:0%
furthermore a pro suicide agenda will
 
07:48:35.788 --> 07:48:35.798 align:start position:0%
affect everyone in New Hampshire and I
 
07:48:37.788 --> 07:48:37.798 align:start position:0%
know that you've probably heard much of
 
07:48:39.670 --> 07:48:39.680 align:start position:0%
this before I'm not going to read
 
07:48:41.628 --> 07:48:41.638 align:start position:0%
everything that I wanted to say I did
 
07:48:44.750 --> 07:48:44.760 align:start position:0%
give you my my testimony earlier um
 
07:48:46.548 --> 07:48:46.558 align:start position:0%
hopefully representative Delorenzo
 
07:48:49.388 --> 07:48:49.398 align:start position:0%
passed it around but just quickly that a
 
07:48:51.948 --> 07:48:51.958 align:start position:0%
suicide assed suicide exploits medically
 
07:48:51.958 --> 07:48:53.110 align:start position:0%
suicide assed suicide exploits medically
vulnerable

07:48:53.110 --> 07:48:53.120 align:start position:0%
vulnerable
 
07:48:55.750 --> 07:48:55.760 align:start position:0%
individuals uh it will undermine Suicide
 
07:48:58.628 --> 07:48:58.638 align:start position:0%
Prevention efforts it uh an assisted
 
07:49:00.830 --> 07:49:00.840 align:start position:0%
suicide law no matter how narrowly drawn
 
07:49:03.110 --> 07:49:03.120 align:start position:0%
opens the door to broader
 
07:49:05.670 --> 07:49:05.680 align:start position:0%
availability and
 
07:49:09.070 --> 07:49:09.080 align:start position:0%
um and that we see other examples of how
 
07:49:11.070 --> 07:49:11.080 align:start position:0%
it's being abused in countries like
 
07:49:13.070 --> 07:49:13.080 align:start position:0%
Canada Scandinavia
 
07:49:15.910 --> 07:49:15.920 align:start position:0%
uh Scandinavian countries and as well as
 
07:49:19.070 --> 07:49:19.080 align:start position:0%
Oregon and um I think I'm just going to
 
07:49:20.270 --> 07:49:20.280 align:start position:0%
end there because I know that it's a
 
07:49:21.868 --> 07:49:21.878 align:start position:0%
really long day and everybody's probably
 
07:49:23.628 --> 07:49:23.638 align:start position:0%
really hungry too so does anybody have
 
07:49:26.030 --> 07:49:26.040 align:start position:0%
any questions of me questions for this
 
07:49:28.308 --> 07:49:28.318 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you very much
 
07:49:30.548 --> 07:49:30.558 align:start position:0%
Miss McGinley thank you so much is there
 
07:49:32.270 --> 07:49:32.280 align:start position:0%
anyone else who wishes to testify on
 
07:49:34.350 --> 07:49:34.360 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
07:49:36.868 --> 07:49:36.878 align:start position:0%
1283 seeing none I'm going to close the
 
07:49:40.830 --> 07:49:40.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:49:42.788 --> 07:49:42.798 align:start position:0%
1283 yes
 
07:49:44.228 --> 07:49:44.238 align:start position:0%

07:49:46.670 --> 07:49:46.680 align:start position:0%
say it's was very nice to see the
 
07:49:48.468 --> 07:49:48.478 align:start position:0%
consideration and thoughtfulness of all
 
07:49:50.708 --> 07:49:50.718 align:start position:0%
the testimony that we all received
 
07:49:53.308 --> 07:49:53.318 align:start position:0%
voluminous emails and actual handwritten
 
07:49:55.750 --> 07:49:55.760 align:start position:0%
letters in EM mailboxes uh it was very
 
07:49:57.510 --> 07:49:57.520 align:start position:0%
refreshing considering the gravity of
 
07:49:59.070 --> 07:49:59.080 align:start position:0%
the subject matter and we on the
 
07:50:00.708 --> 07:50:00.718 align:start position:0%

those bills
 
07:50:45.150 --> 07:50:45.160 align:start position:0%
that we will not be ready to exact that
 
07:50:47.270 --> 07:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
people will not be ready to vote on that
 
07:50:48.708 --> 07:50:48.718 align:start position:0%
you want to have you want to spend more
 
07:50:50.430 --> 07:50:50.440 align:start position:0%
time or whatever and that's fine if
 
07:50:52.548 --> 07:50:52.558 align:start position:0%
there's it's not my intention to rush
 
07:50:54.388 --> 07:50:54.398 align:start position:0%
anybody but I do believe that there
 
07:50:56.228 --> 07:50:56.238 align:start position:0%
probably will be a number of them that
 
07:50:57.868 --> 07:50:57.878 align:start position:0%
we will be able to vote on and it'll be
 
07:50:59.510 --> 07:50:59.520 align:start position:0%

fine that's what that's what we'll do
 
07:51:10.868 --> 07:51:10.878 align:start position:0%
