gilmanton
 
00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 align:start position:0%
this bill is
 
00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
tries to correct a
 
00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:43.919 align:start position:0%
difference in the statute between
 
00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:48.160 align:start position:0%
658 24 and 659 58
 
00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.240 align:start position:0%
where the language is different about
 
00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
who can and cannot work at the elections
 
00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
pretty much what
 
00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960 align:start position:0%
we've tried to do
 
00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
after consultation with the
 
00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 align:start position:0%
secretary of state's office is
 
00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:04.479 align:start position:0%
get that language to agree with each
 
00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:05.430 align:start position:0%
get that language to agree with each
other

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.440 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
and that's what this bill does
 
00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:10.880 align:start position:0%
i know that uh you saw it before in an
 
00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:12.479 align:start position:0%
omnibus bill
 
00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:14.320 align:start position:0%
and somehow it
 
00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:15.680 align:start position:0%
didn't make it all the way through the
 
00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:18.880 align:start position:0%
process so we're back try it again
 
00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
uh also
 
00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 align:start position:0%
i think i have uh
 
00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:23.840 align:start position:0%
at least four bills in front of you
 
00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.110 align:start position:0%
at least four bills in front of you
today

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:25.120 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:28.720 align:start position:0%
uh but i'm also subbing as the chair
 
00:05:31.189 --> 00:05:31.199 align:start position:0%
uh you know when you accept the position
 
00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:32.560 align:start position:0%
as vice chair
 
00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
and uh but uh senator uh bradley who is
 
00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:38.240 align:start position:0%
the chair of health and human services
 
00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:40.160 align:start position:0%
has had his flight cancelled down in
 
00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:42.560 align:start position:0%
florida to get back
 
00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120 align:start position:0%
so i'm trying to
 
00:05:47.189 --> 00:05:47.199 align:start position:0%
split my time which will be a surrogate
 
00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:52.160 align:start position:0%
for a couple of those bills and i'll be
 
00:05:54.629 --> 00:05:54.639 align:start position:0%
back with you as best i can
 
00:05:56.629 --> 00:05:56.639 align:start position:0%
when time permits and if there's any
 
00:05:58.629 --> 00:05:58.639 align:start position:0%
questions on this one
 
00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:00.479 align:start position:0%
i'll hear those now and if there's any
 
00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:02.639 align:start position:0%
questions on the other ones
 
00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:05.120 align:start position:0%
and you'd like to communicate with me
 
00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.029 align:start position:0%
and you'd like to communicate with me
certainly

00:06:07.029 --> 00:06:07.039 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:09.360 align:start position:0%
best way is either call my cell or call
 
00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:11.600 align:start position:0%
shannon and she will get
 
00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
us together
 
00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:14.479 align:start position:0%
thank you senator i'll have the first
 
00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:16.479 align:start position:0%
question does senator bradley understand
 
00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
that the payback for having to spend
 
00:06:20.469 --> 00:06:20.479 align:start position:0%
more time in florida will be a lot more
 
00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:23.280 align:start position:0%
than sharing one of your meetings
 
00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:24.230 align:start position:0%
than sharing one of your meetings
well

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:24.240 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:26.960 align:start position:0%
i you know i guess i didn't say on the
 
00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:28.720 align:start position:0%
phone this morning when he told me that
 
00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
the second flight was canceled that he
 
00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:34.160 align:start position:0%
owed me but i think it's understood
 
00:06:36.309 --> 00:06:36.319 align:start position:0%
all right questions for senator bradley
 
00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:40.240 align:start position:0%
on sb 242 representative bergeron
 
00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:42.720 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you senator gray
 
00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
this is a little bit of a hair splitting
 
00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:45.600 align:start position:0%
question but
 
00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:47.600 align:start position:0%
in your conversations
 
00:06:49.189 --> 00:06:49.199 align:start position:0%
and this refers to the processing of
 
00:06:51.189 --> 00:06:51.199 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots uh in your
 
00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:53.120 align:start position:0%
conversations with the secretary of
 
00:06:55.749 --> 00:06:55.759 align:start position:0%
state um
 
00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:57.120 align:start position:0%
did it ever come up that it might be
 
00:06:59.589 --> 00:06:59.599 align:start position:0%
possible to like cordon off an area
 
00:06:59.599 --> 00:07:00.710 align:start position:0%
possible to like cordon off an area
within

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
within
 
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:03.840 align:start position:0%
voting part you know behind the
 
00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:06.160 align:start position:0%
checklist to be used for the processing
 
00:07:07.749 --> 00:07:07.759 align:start position:0%
of absentee ballots because i'm trying
 
00:07:10.309 --> 00:07:10.319 align:start position:0%
to think of a situation if
 
00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:12.160 align:start position:0%
a moderator is required under state law
 
00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:13.840 align:start position:0%
just for clarification does this deal
 
00:07:15.589 --> 00:07:15.599 align:start position:0%
specifically with this bill or is this a
 
00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:17.120 align:start position:0%
question for senator gray in light of
 
00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
his attendance issues uh
 
00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:22.560 align:start position:0%
it is it is for senator gray okay
 
00:07:23.749 --> 00:07:23.759 align:start position:0%
i just don't want people looking at the
 
00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:25.360 align:start position:0%
bill wondering what absentee ballots and
 
00:07:26.629 --> 00:07:26.639 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm making it longer than i need
 
00:07:28.309 --> 00:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
to i'm just wondering i think i
 
00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:30.400 align:start position:0%
understand the question the question you
 
00:07:33.029 --> 00:07:33.039 align:start position:0%
know because what what we do proposing
 
00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:34.720 align:start position:0%
the bill is that the
 
00:07:37.189 --> 00:07:37.199 align:start position:0%
if the moderator's name is on the ballot
 
00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:38.960 align:start position:0%
you know for other reasons other than
 
00:07:41.749 --> 00:07:41.759 align:start position:0%
being a moderator that they should not
 
00:07:43.749 --> 00:07:43.759 align:start position:0%
touch a voted ballot and that would
 
00:07:45.749 --> 00:07:45.759 align:start position:0%
preclude them from processing those
 
00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:48.720 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots and i fully agree that
 
00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:49.840 align:start position:0%
he should
 
00:07:53.189 --> 00:07:53.199 align:start position:0%
he or she the moderator should
 
00:07:55.749 --> 00:07:55.759 align:start position:0%
designate one of his alternates or
 
00:07:57.990 --> 00:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
whatever to process those absentee
 
00:07:59.670 --> 00:07:59.680 align:start position:0%
ballots and should not
 
00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:00.550 align:start position:0%
ballots and should not
in

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:00.560 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:04.400 align:start position:0%
the 20 plus years that i was a moderator
 
00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:06.800 align:start position:0%
any time my name was on the ballot for
 
00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:10.720 align:start position:0%
school board or or city council
 
00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:13.120 align:start position:0%
you know i did participate in the
 
00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:15.360 align:start position:0%
pre-counting of the ballots before the
 
00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
opening of the election i did pr you
 
00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:20.080 align:start position:0%
know participate in some of the other
 
00:08:22.309 --> 00:08:22.319 align:start position:0%
but the things that the moderator would
 
00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:24.240 align:start position:0%
do like assisting a voter in the voting
 
00:08:27.589 --> 00:08:27.599 align:start position:0%
booth or any of those things and also
 
00:08:30.309 --> 00:08:30.319 align:start position:0%
processing of absentee ballots i always
 
00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:32.320 align:start position:0%
deferred that to someone else which i
 
00:08:34.469 --> 00:08:34.479 align:start position:0%
believe is appropriate
 
00:08:37.909 --> 00:08:37.919 align:start position:0%
for the question further question then
 
00:08:39.670 --> 00:08:39.680 align:start position:0%
then would i be correct in saying that
 
00:08:41.829 --> 00:08:41.839 align:start position:0%
that within the voting area behind the
 
00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
checklist where the public cannot roam
 
00:08:48.389 --> 00:08:48.399 align:start position:0%
um if the moderator cordoned off an area
 
00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
where absentee ballots would be
 
00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:52.880 align:start position:0%
processed he could not go into that area
 
00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:55.600 align:start position:0%
but he could still be in other portions
 
00:08:57.590 --> 00:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
of the non-public area of the voting
 
00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:59.829 align:start position:0%
of the non-public area of the voting
place

00:08:59.829 --> 00:08:59.839 align:start position:0%
place
 
00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:02.320 align:start position:0%
the bill specifically doesn't talk about
 
00:09:05.269 --> 00:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
him being cordoned off from anything
 
00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:07.600 align:start position:0%
the bill talks about touching the ballot
 
00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:09.680 align:start position:0%
okay so as long as they're not touching
 
00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:11.360 align:start position:0%
that voted ballot
 
00:09:13.829 --> 00:09:13.839 align:start position:0%
or assisting a voter you know
 
00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
then the bill would allow them to do
 
00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
those duties
 
00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:18.870 align:start position:0%
those duties
certainly

00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:20.800 align:start position:0%
one of the duties that the moderators
 
00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:23.440 align:start position:0%
should be doing that some don't is
 
00:09:25.829 --> 00:09:25.839 align:start position:0%
observing the length of the lines
 
00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:28.160 align:start position:0%
especially in registration
 
00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:30.720 align:start position:0%
and others i've taken
 
00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
you know checklists you know the a to k
 
00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:34.880 align:start position:0%
and split them in half for
 
00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:37.360 align:start position:0%
five or ten minutes because of a long
 
00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
line i have done other things in the
 
00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:42.560 align:start position:0%
registration table so there's lots of
 
00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:44.720 align:start position:0%
things the moderator can do
 
00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:47.200 align:start position:0%
and not that don't involve touching a
 
00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:50.000 align:start position:0%
voted ballot okay thank you thank you
 
00:09:54.389 --> 00:09:54.399 align:start position:0%

now

00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:08.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:26.230 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:44.710 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:44.720 --> 00:12:11.430 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:11.440 --> 00:14:03.910 align:start position:0%
 
averages

00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:18.790 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:18.800 --> 00:15:24.389 align:start position:0%
 
somebody

00:15:24.389 --> 00:15:24.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:24.399 --> 00:15:25.750 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:15:25.750 --> 00:15:25.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:28.240 align:start position:0%
i'm going to declare it to be 9 45 in
 
00:15:31.189 --> 00:15:31.199 align:start position:0%

to be here i am grant bosse from the new
 
00:15:53.189 --> 00:15:53.199 align:start position:0%
hampshire senate here to introduce
 
00:15:55.189 --> 00:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
senate bill 328 on behalf of its prime
 
00:15:58.629 --> 00:15:58.639 align:start position:0%
sponsor senator james gray of rochester
 
00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:00.800 align:start position:0%
new hampshire currently has the latest
 
00:16:03.269 --> 00:16:03.279 align:start position:0%
state primary election in the nation
 
00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:05.360 align:start position:0%
this year it'll be held on september
 
00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:06.470 align:start position:0%
this year it'll be held on september
13th

00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
13th
 
00:16:08.629 --> 00:16:08.639 align:start position:0%
along with delaware and rhode island
 
00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:10.880 align:start position:0%
this gives the major party nominees just
 
00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:12.800 align:start position:0%
eight weeks to mount a general election
 
00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
campaign often against an incumbent who
 
00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:17.600 align:start position:0%
didn't have to fight through a primary
 
00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
add in recounts appeals to the ballot
 
00:16:21.269 --> 00:16:21.279 align:start position:0%
law commission you're quickly getting to
 
00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
less than 50 days from election day
 
00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
before we know who will actually be on
 
00:16:28.069 --> 00:16:28.079 align:start position:0%
our ballots this puts tremendous
 
00:16:29.829 --> 00:16:29.839 align:start position:0%
pressure on our election officials to
 
00:16:32.389 --> 00:16:32.399 align:start position:0%
print absentee and oversee ballots they
 
00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:34.240 align:start position:0%
always get it done but it's really
 
00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:35.440 align:start position:0%
really tight
 
00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:36.720 align:start position:0%
so there's broad agreement that we
 
00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
should hold our primaries earlier the
 
00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:41.120 align:start position:0%
question is when
 
00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:43.680 align:start position:0%
the governor very publicly concerned
 
00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:46.160 align:start position:0%
about turnout if we hold a primary over
 
00:16:47.509 --> 00:16:47.519 align:start position:0%
the summer when people are out on
 
00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
vacation kids are out of school
 
00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
last year the house position was to move
 
00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:54.720 align:start position:0%
the primary to june and senate disagreed
 
00:16:57.030 --> 00:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
the senate holds that june is the wrong
 
00:16:58.790 --> 00:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
time as it would force sitting
 
00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:01.600 align:start position:0%
legislators to file and run a campaign
 
00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
when their time is most in demand here
 
00:17:05.669 --> 00:17:05.679 align:start position:0%
in concord what we're doing here today
 
00:17:07.909 --> 00:17:07.919 align:start position:0%
this week exceptionally busy after
 
00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:09.760 align:start position:0%
crossover you've got all our bills we've
 
00:17:11.669 --> 00:17:11.679 align:start position:0%
got all your bills
 
00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:14.160 align:start position:0%
the house and senate are
 
00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:16.400 align:start position:0%
spending all of their time doing the job
 
00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
that they were elected to do for a
 
00:17:19.909 --> 00:17:19.919 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars a year senator greg who
 
00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:21.760 align:start position:0%
you heard from today's currently
 
00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:24.400 align:start position:0%
over in hhs hearing 10 of your bills
 
00:17:26.309 --> 00:17:26.319 align:start position:0%
which you obviously want the senate to
 
00:17:27.829 --> 00:17:27.839 align:start position:0%
give consideration
 
00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
now imagine that this week we're also
 
00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:31.760 align:start position:0%
the filing period for house and senate
 
00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:33.200 align:start position:0%
members to decide if they were going to
 
00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:34.880 align:start position:0%
run for re-election or if they had a
 
00:17:36.549 --> 00:17:36.559 align:start position:0%
candidate's night or a debate or an
 
00:17:40.549 --> 00:17:40.559 align:start position:0%
interview for their re-election campaign
 
00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:42.720 align:start position:0%
the senate position is that it is the
 
00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
wrong time for
 
00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
especially state house legislators to be
 
00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:49.440 align:start position:0%
filing and running for re-election in
 
00:17:50.549 --> 00:17:50.559 align:start position:0%
the primary
 
00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:52.400 align:start position:0%
senate bill 328 was amended on the
 
00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:54.640 align:start position:0%
senate floor to move the primary date to
 
00:17:56.549 --> 00:17:56.559 align:start position:0%
the second week in august that's one
 
00:17:58.470 --> 00:17:58.480 align:start position:0%
week off from the bill passed last year
 
00:17:59.750 --> 00:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
out of the senate
 
00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:01.360 align:start position:0%
allowing candidates a chance to finish
 
00:18:03.029 --> 00:18:03.039 align:start position:0%
their work in the legislature before
 
00:18:05.029 --> 00:18:05.039 align:start position:0%
returning to the campaign trail this
 
00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:06.320 align:start position:0%
would give the secretary of state's
 
00:18:08.549 --> 00:18:08.559 align:start position:0%
office more time to prepare ukava and
 
00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:10.480 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots
 
00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
this amendment received a strong 19-5
 
00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:13.750 align:start position:0%
this amendment received a strong 19-5
vote

00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:13.760 align:start position:0%
vote
 
00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
showing the senate's strong preference
 
00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
for an august primary as opposed to one
 
00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:19.280 align:start position:0%
in june
 
00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:20.720 align:start position:0%
summer primaries are actually quite
 
00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:23.120 align:start position:0%
common across the country in fact 14
 
00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
states will hold their
 
00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:27.760 align:start position:0%
primary elections in august this year
 
00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:29.840 align:start position:0%
according to ncsl as close as our
 
00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:31.200 align:start position:0%
neighbors in vermont as far away as
 
00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:33.200 align:start position:0%
alaska and hawaii
 
00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:34.950 align:start position:0%
alaska and hawaii
um

00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:34.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:36.480 align:start position:0%
if you have any questions on this i
 
00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
would be happy to pass them along to
 
00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
senator gray i would also encourage you
 
00:18:41.029 --> 00:18:41.039 align:start position:0%
to just send them to shannon she tends
 
00:18:42.789 --> 00:18:42.799 align:start position:0%
to get answers pretty quickly
 
00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:44.960 align:start position:0%
we ask for your consideration of senate
 
00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:48.400 align:start position:0%
bill 328 and thank you for your time
 
00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
thank you representative bergeron
 
00:18:52.789 --> 00:18:52.799 align:start position:0%
thank you and this is probably a
 
00:18:54.390 --> 00:18:54.400 align:start position:0%
question that the sponsors will need to
 
00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:56.230 align:start position:0%
question that the sponsors will need to
answer

00:18:56.230 --> 00:18:56.240 align:start position:0%
answer
 
00:18:58.870 --> 00:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
however are you aware that
 
00:19:01.029 --> 00:19:01.039 align:start position:0%
the bill provides
 
00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
that the
 
00:19:05.590 --> 00:19:05.600 align:start position:0%
last date for a correction
 
00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:11.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:13.440 align:start position:0%
the tuesday before the first wednesday
 
00:19:14.789 --> 00:19:14.799 align:start position:0%
in may
 
00:19:14.799 --> 00:19:16.310 align:start position:0%
in may
however

00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
however
 
00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
checklists are closed earlier than that
 
00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:20.960 align:start position:0%
for towns that are holding may town
 
00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:21.990 align:start position:0%
for towns that are holding may town
elections

00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
elections
 
00:19:23.110 --> 00:19:23.120 align:start position:0%
for example
 
00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:24.880 align:start position:0%
this year that closing date is april
 
00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:25.909 align:start position:0%
this year that closing date is april
30th

00:19:25.909 --> 00:19:25.919 align:start position:0%
30th
 
00:19:25.919 --> 00:19:27.110 align:start position:0%
30th
um

00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
so i guess if you could ask senator gray
 
00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:30.640 align:start position:0%
if he would be amenable to perhaps
 
00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:32.960 align:start position:0%
amending that that language so that the
 
00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:34.960 align:start position:0%
problem is addressed uh he shared your
 
00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:36.640 align:start position:0%
email with me he's aware of the concern
 
00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:38.640 align:start position:0%
and if the committee thinks that they
 
00:19:40.549 --> 00:19:40.559 align:start position:0%
can harmonize
 
00:19:41.909 --> 00:19:41.919 align:start position:0%
those new hampshire has a lot of
 
00:19:41.919 --> 00:19:43.190 align:start position:0%
those new hampshire has a lot of
elections

00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:43.200 align:start position:0%
elections
 
00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
and if if we want to harmonize all those
 
00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:46.640 align:start position:0%
dates he'd be open to seeing your
 
00:19:49.669 --> 00:19:49.679 align:start position:0%
solution thank you
 
00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
representative terozian thank you madam
 
00:19:55.510 --> 00:19:55.520 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking the question
 
00:19:57.430 --> 00:19:57.440 align:start position:0%
so i'm clear on what the primary date is
 
00:19:59.029 --> 00:19:59.039 align:start position:0%
in essence it's
 
00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:00.640 align:start position:0%
pretty much exactly a month earlier than
 
00:20:02.549 --> 00:20:02.559 align:start position:0%
what it is currently does this affect
 
00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:04.480 align:start position:0%
the filing date
 
00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:06.240 align:start position:0%
for running for office at all yes
 
00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:17.440 align:start position:0%
representative mcdonald
 
00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:19.120 align:start position:0%
my name is debasi
 
00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
um this bill as you mentioned is very
 
00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:23.280 align:start position:0%
similar to the one that the governor
 
00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
vetoed last year one of his concerns at
 
00:20:26.549 --> 00:20:26.559 align:start position:0%
the time
 
00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
was the recruitment of election workers
 
00:20:31.029 --> 00:20:31.039 align:start position:0%
and so forth is that anyway a concern in
 
00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:32.080 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:34.880 align:start position:0%
and if i may also ask madam chairman uh
 
00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:36.400 align:start position:0%
do you expect a different outcome from
 
00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
the governor this time i know you can't
 
00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:39.760 align:start position:0%
speak for him but is there any reason to
 
00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
expect a different outcome
 
00:20:44.149 --> 00:20:44.159 align:start position:0%
uh i think we can make the make the case
 
00:20:45.909 --> 00:20:45.919 align:start position:0%
we've made there are competing interests
 
00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:48.320 align:start position:0%
a lot of the bills the all the easy laws
 
00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
have been passed
 
00:20:51.669 --> 00:20:51.679 align:start position:0%
um you're left with the tough ones
 
00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:54.240 align:start position:0%
and so there are there are uh competing
 
00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:56.720 align:start position:0%
values that are all valid uh the senate
 
00:21:00.149 --> 00:21:00.159 align:start position:0%
believes that a june primary uh balances
 
00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
those the best uh the governor disagrees
 
00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:04.240 align:start position:0%
the house has disagreed in the past so
 
00:21:06.149 --> 00:21:06.159 align:start position:0%
we we're we're hoping uh we might be
 
00:21:07.909 --> 00:21:07.919 align:start position:0%
able to persuade him this time we'll
 
00:21:10.149 --> 00:21:10.159 align:start position:0%
follow up madam champion follow up uh
 
00:21:13.029 --> 00:21:13.039 align:start position:0%
and just to be totally clear i i think i
 
00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
totally understand what you're talking
 
00:21:15.909 --> 00:21:15.919 align:start position:0%
about so you're saying that a june
 
00:21:17.029 --> 00:21:17.039 align:start position:0%
primary would
 
00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:18.720 align:start position:0%
interfere with legislative duties and
 
00:21:20.390 --> 00:21:20.400 align:start position:0%
that is why you amended the bill the
 
00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:22.240 align:start position:0%
senate amended the bill that was a
 
00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
common argument on the senate floor as
 
00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
we were debating this over actually
 
00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
several weeks we put we special ordered
 
00:21:30.149 --> 00:21:30.159 align:start position:0%
it a few times to try to get a consensus
 
00:21:32.789 --> 00:21:32.799 align:start position:0%
and we eventually got a 19 to five vote
 
00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:34.880 align:start position:0%
in favor of the august primary and the
 
00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
most common argument raised was that
 
00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:41.200 align:start position:0%
senators and house members are here
 
00:21:42.789 --> 00:21:42.799 align:start position:0%
in june
 
00:21:44.549 --> 00:21:44.559 align:start position:0%
not this year we hope to get out in may
 
00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:46.960 align:start position:0%
but certainly in april and may and into
 
00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:49.200 align:start position:0%
june um they're getting their work done
 
00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:50.320 align:start position:0%
they've got deadlines they've got
 
00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:53.360 align:start position:0%
committees at conference and um a filing
 
00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:54.310 align:start position:0%
committees at conference and um a filing
period

00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:54.320 align:start position:0%
period
 
00:21:56.549 --> 00:21:56.559 align:start position:0%
right at the end of session primary over
 
00:21:59.110 --> 00:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
june july and august and then a primary
 
00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:01.360 align:start position:0%
held in august they felt was the best
 
00:22:03.669 --> 00:22:03.679 align:start position:0%
best balance of that time
 
00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you further
 
00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:08.080 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:10.000 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you mr bossie we do
 
00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
have other people signed up to speak on
 
00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
this bill also signed up to speak on sb
 
00:22:16.789 --> 00:22:16.799 align:start position:0%
328 relating to the date of the primary
 
00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:39.590 align:start position:0%
 
thank

00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:41.360 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman and members of
 
00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is alvin c i live
 
00:22:46.789 --> 00:22:46.799 align:start position:0%
in loudoun and i'm here on my own behalf
 
00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:48.880 align:start position:0%
and in support of this bill
 
00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:51.350 align:start position:0%
and in support of this bill
i

00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:52.640 align:start position:0%
fully support
 
00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:55.280 align:start position:0%
moving the primary election earlier i
 
00:22:56.870 --> 00:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
think the final candidates for the
 
00:22:59.029 --> 00:22:59.039 align:start position:0%
general election need more time to
 
00:22:59.039 --> 00:23:00.470 align:start position:0%
general election need more time to
campaign

00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:00.480 align:start position:0%
campaign
 
00:23:03.029 --> 00:23:03.039 align:start position:0%
but what i want to address here today is
 
00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
an unintended consequence
 
00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:07.520 align:start position:0%
of moving the primary
 
00:23:10.149 --> 00:23:10.159 align:start position:0%
and that is that the candidates who
 
00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:12.880 align:start position:0%
follow by nomination papers
 
00:23:15.430 --> 00:23:15.440 align:start position:0%
all the uh
 
00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:18.320 align:start position:0%
dates specified in the in the bill or in
 
00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:19.270 align:start position:0%
dates specified in the in the bill or in
the

00:23:19.270 --> 00:23:19.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:23:22.149 --> 00:23:22.159 align:start position:0%
ls rsas
 
00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
regarding the
 
00:23:25.669 --> 00:23:25.679 align:start position:0%
filing of papers
 
00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
are tied to the primary
 
00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:31.669 align:start position:0%
are tied to the primary
the

00:23:31.669 --> 00:23:31.679 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:23:33.909 --> 00:23:33.919 align:start position:0%
declaration of
 
00:23:33.919 --> 00:23:35.110 align:start position:0%
declaration of

candidacy has to be filed during the
 
00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:40.400 align:start position:0%
primary filing period
 
00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:42.640 align:start position:0%
and then the dates for getting the
 
00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:43.830 align:start position:0%
and then the dates for getting the
papers

00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:43.840 align:start position:0%

00:23:45.510 --> 00:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
to the

towns to the checklist
 
00:23:50.149 --> 00:23:50.159 align:start position:0%
supervisors a checklist to check and
 
00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
then on back to the secretary of state's
 
00:23:55.029 --> 00:23:55.039 align:start position:0%
office are all tied to a certain number
 
00:23:57.430 --> 00:23:57.440 align:start position:0%
of weeks before the primary
 
00:23:59.110 --> 00:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
i would
 
00:24:02.230 --> 00:24:02.240 align:start position:0%
like to suggest that
 
00:24:03.750 --> 00:24:03.760 align:start position:0%
in rsa
 
00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:05.750 align:start position:0%
in rsa
655

00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
655
 
00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:07.350 align:start position:0%
655
14a

00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:07.360 align:start position:0%
14a
 
00:24:10.470 --> 00:24:10.480 align:start position:0%
41 and 43
 
00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:12.640 align:start position:0%
some changes on that
 
00:24:15.269 --> 00:24:15.279 align:start position:0%
and this is something that i've provided
 
00:24:19.029 --> 00:24:19.039 align:start position:0%
before on testimony last year on on the
 
00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:21.360 align:start position:0%
couple of bills that
 
00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:23.120 align:start position:0%
went through
 
00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:25.029 align:start position:0%
went through
but

00:24:25.029 --> 00:24:25.039 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:24:26.350 --> 00:24:26.360 align:start position:0%
in fort
 
00:24:29.909 --> 00:24:29.919 align:start position:0%
655-14a i would suggest that the
 
00:24:32.789 --> 00:24:32.799 align:start position:0%
instead of having the declaration of
 
00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:35.440 align:start position:0%
candidacy be filed
 
00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:37.600 align:start position:0%
during the primary filing period that it
 
00:24:40.789 --> 00:24:40.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:43.350 --> 00:24:43.360 align:start position:0%
specified as 15 weeks before the general
 
00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:45.360 align:start position:0%
election that is a slight change that
 
00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
makes it slightly later but
 
00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:48.630 align:start position:0%
makes it slightly later but
for

00:24:48.630 --> 00:24:48.640 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
minor parties they sometimes have
 
00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
national conventions
 
00:24:56.470 --> 00:24:56.480 align:start position:0%
uh usually in the time frame of between
 
00:24:58.870 --> 00:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
memorial day and independence day
 
00:25:02.549 --> 00:25:02.559 align:start position:0%
so that would give them time to
 
00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
select a
 
00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:06.720 align:start position:0%
at least for presidential candidates
 
00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:08.240 align:start position:0%
then for
 
00:25:10.470 --> 00:25:10.480 align:start position:0%
6 55 41
 
00:25:12.549 --> 00:25:12.559 align:start position:0%
instead of two weeks before the primary
 
00:25:14.390 --> 00:25:14.400 align:start position:0%
set it for 10 weeks before the general
 
00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:16.630 align:start position:0%
set it for 10 weeks before the general
election

00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:16.640 align:start position:0%
election
 
00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:19.200 align:start position:0%
and that's for
 
00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
the candidate having his papers
 
00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:27.269 align:start position:0%
the candidate having his papers
submitted

00:25:27.269 --> 00:25:27.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:30.149 --> 00:25:30.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:33.200 align:start position:0%
papers the safe advisor
 
00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:34.960 align:start position:0%
of the check they need to go to the
 
00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:37.440 align:start position:0%
supervisor checks weeks 13 weeks before
 
00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
the general election rather than five
 
00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
weeks before the primary
 
00:25:44.549 --> 00:25:44.559 align:start position:0%
the supervisor of the checklist have to
 
00:25:47.190 --> 00:25:47.200 align:start position:0%
have them completed
 
00:25:48.789 --> 00:25:48.799 align:start position:0%
ten weeks before the general election
 
00:25:51.430 --> 00:25:51.440 align:start position:0%
instead of two weeks before the primary
 
00:25:53.269 --> 00:25:53.279 align:start position:0%
and then the final one was getting them
 
00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:55.440 align:start position:0%
to the secretary of state which
 
00:25:58.390 --> 00:25:58.400 align:start position:0%
uh currently in 655-43 says one week
 
00:26:01.269 --> 00:26:01.279 align:start position:0%
before the primary
 
00:26:02.950 --> 00:26:02.960 align:start position:0%
this would make it nine weeks before the
 
00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:04.480 align:start position:0%
general election
 
00:26:05.669 --> 00:26:05.679 align:start position:0%
and these
 
00:26:06.789 --> 00:26:06.799 align:start position:0%
i just
 
00:26:08.149 --> 00:26:08.159 align:start position:0%
went through the
 
00:26:10.549 --> 00:26:10.559 align:start position:0%
political calendar that we use
 
00:26:10.559 --> 00:26:11.750 align:start position:0%
political calendar that we use
and

00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
just counted back from
 
00:26:17.669 --> 00:26:17.679 align:start position:0%
based on this year and and two years ago
 
00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:19.440 align:start position:0%
i realized this bill doesn't take effect
 
00:26:21.190 --> 00:26:21.200 align:start position:0%
until next year so it would not affect
 
00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:23.440 align:start position:0%
this year
 
00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
and just for reference
 
00:26:28.789 --> 00:26:28.799 align:start position:0%
that uh 15 weeks before the uh general
 
00:26:28.799 --> 00:26:30.230 align:start position:0%
that uh 15 weeks before the uh general
election

00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:30.240 align:start position:0%
election
 
00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:32.640 align:start position:0%
if it were this year would be
 
00:26:37.669 --> 00:26:37.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:39.909 --> 00:26:39.919 align:start position:0%
the secretary's state has been given a
 
00:26:41.430 --> 00:26:41.440 align:start position:0%
copy of this
 
00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:43.840 align:start position:0%
uh i have not heard back from him
 
00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:45.760 align:start position:0%
whether there was any
 
00:26:47.830 --> 00:26:47.840 align:start position:0%
issues on this
 
00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:48.710 align:start position:0%
issues on this
um

00:26:48.710 --> 00:26:48.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
but it's basically identical to what it
 
00:26:53.269 --> 00:26:53.279 align:start position:0%
is right now with the exception of the
 
00:26:55.669 --> 00:26:55.679 align:start position:0%
declaration of candidacy
 
00:26:57.590 --> 00:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
and i'll be happy to take any questions
 
00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:00.320 align:start position:0%
if there are any thank you mr c any
 
00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:03.430 align:start position:0%
if there are any thank you mr c any
questions

00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you also signed up to
 
00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:10.480 align:start position:0%
speak on sb 328 is dan mcguire
 
00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:13.440 align:start position:0%
the honorable dan mcguire from epsom
 
00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
formerly i guess
 
00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
i know i think you're always honorable
 
00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:19.120 align:start position:0%
at that point
 
00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
um possibly future all right
 
00:27:23.110 --> 00:27:23.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much madam chair members
 
00:27:24.549 --> 00:27:24.559 align:start position:0%
of the committee for the record my name
 
00:27:26.710 --> 00:27:26.720 align:start position:0%
is dan mcguire i'm from the town of
 
00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:28.070 align:start position:0%
is dan mcguire i'm from the town of
epsom

00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
epsom
 
00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:30.640 align:start position:0%
um i'm in favor of moving the primary i
 
00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
actually would prefer the june date but
 
00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:36.880 align:start position:0%
i think this is a reasonable compromise
 
00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:39.760 align:start position:0%
the current calendar
 
00:27:43.029 --> 00:27:43.039 align:start position:0%
is very much um to the liking of how the
 
00:27:44.950 --> 00:27:44.960 align:start position:0%
house members i think
 
00:27:47.110 --> 00:27:47.120 align:start position:0%
um in general when you when you're a
 
00:27:50.149 --> 00:27:50.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:51.909 --> 00:27:51.919 align:start position:0%
you don't have to raise much money for
 
00:27:53.909 --> 00:27:53.919 align:start position:0%
your campaign typically people fund
 
00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
their own campaigns
 
00:27:57.350 --> 00:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
most members
 
00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:00.480 align:start position:0%
uh either will have a a
 
00:28:01.909 --> 00:28:01.919 align:start position:0%
the general election will be the
 
00:28:03.430 --> 00:28:03.440 align:start position:0%
significant election for them or the
 
00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:05.440 align:start position:0%
primary election will be the significant
 
00:28:08.389 --> 00:28:08.399 align:start position:0%
election for them uh not both
 
00:28:08.399 --> 00:28:09.510 align:start position:0%
election for them uh not both
um

00:28:09.510 --> 00:28:09.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:10.389 align:start position:0%
um
and

00:28:10.389 --> 00:28:10.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:12.640 align:start position:0%
and so and it's very comfortable to
 
00:28:14.389 --> 00:28:14.399 align:start position:0%
finish your work if you're an incumbent
 
00:28:16.149 --> 00:28:16.159 align:start position:0%
house member to finish your work in the
 
00:28:16.159 --> 00:28:17.510 align:start position:0%
house member to finish your work in the
house

00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
house
 
00:28:20.710 --> 00:28:20.720 align:start position:0%
in june sign up for reelection if the
 
00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
primary is your primary election work on
 
00:28:25.510 --> 00:28:25.520 align:start position:0%
it over the summer
 
00:28:27.510 --> 00:28:27.520 align:start position:0%
and have it and you're done if the
 
00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:30.480 align:start position:0%
general is your primary election
 
00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:32.720 align:start position:0%
you coast during the summer and then
 
00:28:34.549 --> 00:28:34.559 align:start position:0%
then two months is plenty to run for the
 
00:28:34.559 --> 00:28:37.110 align:start position:0%
then two months is plenty to run for the
house

00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:37.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
but if you're someone trying to break
 
00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:42.640 align:start position:0%
into one of the higher offices
 
00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:44.720 align:start position:0%
the statewide offices or executive
 
00:28:46.789 --> 00:28:46.799 align:start position:0%
council and so on
 
00:28:49.269 --> 00:28:49.279 align:start position:0%
then this current schedule
 
00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:52.640 align:start position:0%
is really bad for you it's it's it's
 
00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:55.360 align:start position:0%
very favorable for incumbents
 
00:28:57.590 --> 00:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
but it's very
 
00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:00.080 align:start position:0%
very difficult for challengers because
 
00:29:02.470 --> 00:29:02.480 align:start position:0%
those are offices that require a lot of
 
00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:04.310 align:start position:0%
those are offices that require a lot of
money

00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:04.320 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:06.640 align:start position:0%
for ads and and
 
00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:08.880 align:start position:0%
staff and all that sort of thing
 
00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
and and so
 
00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
frequently when you're a challenger uh
 
00:29:14.789 --> 00:29:14.799 align:start position:0%
if when you're an incumbent
 
00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:16.960 align:start position:0%
you you typically are not seriously
 
00:29:19.269 --> 00:29:19.279 align:start position:0%
challenged in the primary right you're
 
00:29:22.789 --> 00:29:22.799 align:start position:0%
someone who's who's an incumbent uh can
 
00:29:22.799 --> 00:29:24.310 align:start position:0%
someone who's who's an incumbent uh can
frequently

00:29:24.310 --> 00:29:24.320 align:start position:0%
frequently
 
00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:26.240 align:start position:0%
is nearly guaranteed not always
 
00:29:28.389 --> 00:29:28.399 align:start position:0%
obviously but nearly guaranteed to win
 
00:29:30.789 --> 00:29:30.799 align:start position:0%
their primary and so they know they're
 
00:29:33.029 --> 00:29:33.039 align:start position:0%
going to be in the general election and
 
00:29:34.149 --> 00:29:34.159 align:start position:0%
they know
 
00:29:35.990 --> 00:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
they can spend the summer
 
00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:38.320 align:start position:0%
um raising money and getting prepared
 
00:29:39.990 --> 00:29:40.000 align:start position:0%
for the general election and so on
 
00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
getting their staff together and all
 
00:29:44.549 --> 00:29:44.559 align:start position:0%
that but frequently there's multiple in
 
00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
the other party there's multiple
 
00:29:48.630 --> 00:29:48.640 align:start position:0%
challengers they don't know if they're
 
00:29:49.990 --> 00:29:50.000 align:start position:0%
going to be the winner it's it's
 
00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
frequently competitive
 
00:29:53.909 --> 00:29:53.919 align:start position:0%
and so they don't find out to
 
00:29:53.919 --> 00:29:55.510 align:start position:0%
and so they don't find out to
mid-september

00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:55.520 align:start position:0%
mid-september
 
00:29:57.029 --> 00:29:57.039 align:start position:0%
whether or not they're going to have a
 
00:29:59.590 --> 00:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
general election and that leaves them
 
00:30:02.149 --> 00:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
such a short time two months
 
00:30:02.159 --> 00:30:03.190 align:start position:0%
such a short time two months
to

00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:03.200 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:30:05.269 --> 00:30:05.279 align:start position:0%
raise money get a general election
 
00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:08.240 align:start position:0%
campaign together and go up against a
 
00:30:11.269 --> 00:30:11.279 align:start position:0%
typically much better funded incumbent
 
00:30:11.279 --> 00:30:12.389 align:start position:0%
typically much better funded incumbent
so

00:30:12.389 --> 00:30:12.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:14.080 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:30:16.789 --> 00:30:16.799 align:start position:0%
expands that period of time that general
 
00:30:18.710 --> 00:30:18.720 align:start position:0%
election period
 
00:30:21.190 --> 00:30:21.200 align:start position:0%
by about 50 percent right so it's
 
00:30:23.190 --> 00:30:23.200 align:start position:0%
currently roughly two months it adds a
 
00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:26.240 align:start position:0%
month to it so that's a significant
 
00:30:28.710 --> 00:30:28.720 align:start position:0%
improvement for and and
 
00:30:30.950 --> 00:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
it makes it a little bit fairer i mean
 
00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
it clearly incumbents will still have
 
00:30:35.430 --> 00:30:35.440 align:start position:0%
big advantages
 
00:30:37.269 --> 00:30:37.279 align:start position:0%
there's no way around that
 
00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
but this this
 
00:30:42.230 --> 00:30:42.240 align:start position:0%
makes that crucial period prior to the
 
00:30:44.870 --> 00:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
general election roughly 50 percent
 
00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:48.320 align:start position:0%
longer and that that i think is very
 
00:30:51.269 --> 00:30:51.279 align:start position:0%
important for fairness
 
00:30:54.389 --> 00:30:54.399 align:start position:0%
for challengers so it's not as fun it's
 
00:30:57.669 --> 00:30:57.679 align:start position:0%
not as nice for house members
 
00:30:59.990 --> 00:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
but it's not that much different i don't
 
00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
think and it's it's it's something
 
00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:05.360 align:start position:0%
i would hope that you would um
 
00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:07.840 align:start position:0%
you would pass thank you madam troop
 
00:31:10.389 --> 00:31:10.399 align:start position:0%
thank you questions for
 
00:31:13.029 --> 00:31:13.039 align:start position:0%
mr mcguire
 
00:31:15.029 --> 00:31:15.039 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you yeah you've had
 
00:31:19.190 --> 00:31:19.200 align:start position:0%
this bill over and over so
 
00:31:21.269 --> 00:31:21.279 align:start position:0%
well it's nice to hear that that house
 
00:31:23.269 --> 00:31:23.279 align:start position:0%
members have it easier on something
 
00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:25.200 align:start position:0%
there you go
 
00:31:27.269 --> 00:31:27.279 align:start position:0%
um also signed up to speak on this is
 
00:31:29.029 --> 00:31:29.039 align:start position:0%
patricia lovejoy from the secretary of
 
00:31:34.950 --> 00:31:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:36.950 --> 00:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
good morning madam chair thank you my
 
00:31:39.509 --> 00:31:39.519 align:start position:0%
name is patricia lovejoy i am the senior
 
00:31:43.509 --> 00:31:43.519 align:start position:0%
deputy secretary of state uh on
 
00:31:46.870 --> 00:31:46.880 align:start position:0%
on this bill 328 the date of the primary
 
00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state's
 
00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:50.960 align:start position:0%
position is
 
00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
we're concerned about voter turnout new
 
00:31:56.630 --> 00:31:56.640 align:start position:0%
hampshire has a history of very good
 
00:31:59.509 --> 00:31:59.519 align:start position:0%
voter turnout even in our primaries
 
00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:01.760 align:start position:0%
and we're concerned that
 
00:32:04.470 --> 00:32:04.480 align:start position:0%
you know august is a time of vacation
 
00:32:06.630 --> 00:32:06.640 align:start position:0%
kids are out of school
 
00:32:10.230 --> 00:32:10.240 align:start position:0%
it's a summer state of mind
 
00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
unlike many of us who've been involved
 
00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:14.480 align:start position:0%
in politics many of the general public
 
00:32:15.990 --> 00:32:16.000 align:start position:0%
do not
 
00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:19.200 align:start position:0%
tune in to politics until the calendar
 
00:32:21.269 --> 00:32:21.279 align:start position:0%
turns over to september so we're
 
00:32:24.389 --> 00:32:24.399 align:start position:0%
concerned about the uh turn uh turnout
 
00:32:26.950 --> 00:32:26.960 align:start position:0%
that's our that's our biggest concern um
 
00:32:29.190 --> 00:32:29.200 align:start position:0%
just a couple other issues for you to
 
00:32:31.990 --> 00:32:32.000 align:start position:0%
keep in the back of your mind during the
 
00:32:35.269 --> 00:32:35.279 align:start position:0%
sign up period this is in may
 
00:32:37.669 --> 00:32:37.679 align:start position:0%
we do have an alternate town election
 
00:32:39.669 --> 00:32:39.679 align:start position:0%
day which is in may there are many of
 
00:32:41.590 --> 00:32:41.600 align:start position:0%
our municipalities that have their
 
00:32:43.909 --> 00:32:43.919 align:start position:0%
elections at that time this year that
 
00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
date is may 10th
 
00:32:49.750 --> 00:32:49.760 align:start position:0%
so it can be a concern for
 
00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:51.110 align:start position:0%
so it can be a concern for
town

00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
town
 
00:32:53.029 --> 00:32:53.039 align:start position:0%
town clerk's offices
 
00:32:54.549 --> 00:32:54.559 align:start position:0%
we are also concerned about the
 
00:32:56.789 --> 00:32:56.799 align:start position:0%
recruitment of
 
00:33:00.630 --> 00:33:00.640 align:start position:0%
of workers at the at the polls
 
00:33:02.230 --> 00:33:02.240 align:start position:0%
obviously every 10 years when we have
 
00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:03.830 align:start position:0%
obviously every 10 years when we have
redistricting

00:33:03.830 --> 00:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
redistricting
 
00:33:06.630 --> 00:33:06.640 align:start position:0%
districts are not always set this bill
 
00:33:09.190 --> 00:33:09.200 align:start position:0%
does uh on page
 
00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:10.870 align:start position:0%
does uh on page
one

00:33:10.870 --> 00:33:10.880 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:11.590 align:start position:0%
one
in

00:33:11.590 --> 00:33:11.600 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:33:14.470 --> 00:33:14.480 align:start position:0%
lines five through seven does give the
 
00:33:16.549 --> 00:33:16.559 align:start position:0%
secretary of state's office the ability
 
00:33:19.669 --> 00:33:19.679 align:start position:0%
to change the date of the primary and
 
00:33:21.509 --> 00:33:21.519 align:start position:0%
the date of signups
 
00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
currently the governor has signed the
 
00:33:26.310 --> 00:33:26.320 align:start position:0%
house districts but those are the only
 
00:33:29.430 --> 00:33:29.440 align:start position:0%
ones that are set in stone at this point
 
00:33:33.029 --> 00:33:33.039 align:start position:0%
and we are um in the first week of april
 
00:33:35.909 --> 00:33:35.919 align:start position:0%
so that if the primary is uh the sign up
 
00:33:37.909 --> 00:33:37.919 align:start position:0%
is the beginning of may
 
00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
depending upon how long that process
 
00:33:41.430 --> 00:33:41.440 align:start position:0%
takes so you may have every 10 years
 
00:33:43.990 --> 00:33:44.000 align:start position:0%
that the primary is moved off so we just
 
00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
wanted to bring those concerns to you
 
00:33:47.110 --> 00:33:47.120 align:start position:0%
and i would be
 
00:33:49.190 --> 00:33:49.200 align:start position:0%
willing to take any questions
 
00:33:51.110 --> 00:33:51.120 align:start position:0%
questions from ms lovejoy representative
 
00:33:53.269 --> 00:33:53.279 align:start position:0%
terrezan thank you madam chair thank you
 
00:33:56.710 --> 00:33:56.720 align:start position:0%
uh deputy secretary
 
00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:57.909 align:start position:0%
uh deputy secretary
so

00:33:57.909 --> 00:33:57.919 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:34:00.870 --> 00:34:00.880 align:start position:0%
we've heard uh this legislative year um
 
00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
from many of the concern that you heard
 
00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:04.389 align:start position:0%
from many of the concern that you heard
from

00:34:04.389 --> 00:34:04.399 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
the last couple of speakers on this
 
00:34:08.069 --> 00:34:08.079 align:start position:0%
legislation of the concern with the very
 
00:34:08.079 --> 00:34:09.829 align:start position:0%
legislation of the concern with the very
tight

00:34:09.829 --> 00:34:09.839 align:start position:0%
tight
 
00:34:11.990 --> 00:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
time frame between the primary date and
 
00:34:14.069 --> 00:34:14.079 align:start position:0%
the general election date
 
00:34:16.069 --> 00:34:16.079 align:start position:0%
how do we balance that
 
00:34:17.990 --> 00:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
very i think
 
00:34:20.230 --> 00:34:20.240 align:start position:0%
real concern with the concern that you
 
00:34:21.349 --> 00:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
bring up
 
00:34:24.389 --> 00:34:24.399 align:start position:0%
does this does the department have a
 
00:34:26.950 --> 00:34:26.960 align:start position:0%
an alternate date they might suggest uh
 
00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:27.750 align:start position:0%
an alternate date they might suggest uh
we

00:34:27.750 --> 00:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:34:29.829 --> 00:34:29.839 align:start position:0%
we actually prefer the current date that
 
00:34:32.710 --> 00:34:32.720 align:start position:0%
uh we have but as far as the the time
 
00:34:34.470 --> 00:34:34.480 align:start position:0%
period for us getting ballots and you
 
00:34:36.389 --> 00:34:36.399 align:start position:0%
will call the ballots we have always
 
00:34:38.310 --> 00:34:38.320 align:start position:0%
managed to to do that even though it is
 
00:34:40.869 --> 00:34:40.879 align:start position:0%
a tight time frame um i guess the reason
 
00:34:43.349 --> 00:34:43.359 align:start position:0%
you get paid the big bucks is to uh to
 
00:34:45.829 --> 00:34:45.839 align:start position:0%
make these decisions obviously whatever
 
00:34:45.839 --> 00:34:47.109 align:start position:0%
make these decisions obviously whatever
decision

00:34:47.109 --> 00:34:47.119 align:start position:0%
decision
 
00:34:49.430 --> 00:34:49.440 align:start position:0%
the legislature and the governor signs
 
00:34:51.669 --> 00:34:51.679 align:start position:0%
off on we will make work
 
00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:54.240 align:start position:0%
our i said our big concern is voter
 
00:34:55.589 --> 00:34:55.599 align:start position:0%
turnout i mean
 
00:34:57.349 --> 00:34:57.359 align:start position:0%
we are always
 
00:34:59.109 --> 00:34:59.119 align:start position:0%
concerned about keeping our first in the
 
00:35:01.349 --> 00:35:01.359 align:start position:0%
nation primary and one of the factors
 
00:35:03.829 --> 00:35:03.839 align:start position:0%
that does go into that choosing of who's
 
00:35:05.589 --> 00:35:05.599 align:start position:0%
going to be the first in the nation
 
00:35:08.950 --> 00:35:08.960 align:start position:0%
primary is voter turnout
 
00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:10.310 align:start position:0%
primary is voter turnout
follow-up

00:35:10.310 --> 00:35:10.320 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:35:11.829 --> 00:35:11.839 align:start position:0%
quick follow-up i'm glad you brought
 
00:35:14.069 --> 00:35:14.079 align:start position:0%
that up because in order to keep that
 
00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
first in the nation primary we usually
 
00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:18.400 align:start position:0%
have a very early primary for that so
 
00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
that kind of contradicts what you said
 
00:35:21.829 --> 00:35:21.839 align:start position:0%
in regard to september but
 
00:35:23.190 --> 00:35:23.200 align:start position:0%
i don't know if you have any any
 
00:35:24.390 --> 00:35:24.400 align:start position:0%
comments on that
 
00:35:28.310 --> 00:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
no i think i i understand uh the
 
00:35:30.710 --> 00:35:30.720 align:start position:0%
i i get the irony
 
00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:31.430 align:start position:0%
i i get the irony
but

00:35:31.430 --> 00:35:31.440 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:35:34.950 --> 00:35:34.960 align:start position:0%
as far as for our state elections um the
 
00:35:37.109 --> 00:35:37.119 align:start position:0%
secretary's state's
 
00:35:37.119 --> 00:35:37.990 align:start position:0%
secretary's state's
office

00:35:37.990 --> 00:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
office
 
00:35:39.829 --> 00:35:39.839 align:start position:0%
prefers the um
 
00:35:42.550 --> 00:35:42.560 align:start position:0%
the september primary but we will make
 
00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:45.040 align:start position:0%
whatever whatever you decide and
 
00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:46.240 align:start position:0%
whatever the legislature and the
 
00:35:49.750 --> 00:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
governor decides work we just wanted to
 
00:35:52.470 --> 00:35:52.480 align:start position:0%
bring our concerns to you on to have
 
00:35:55.670 --> 00:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
while you're making that decision
 
00:35:56.790 --> 00:35:56.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:35:59.030 --> 00:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
representative mcdonald
 
00:36:00.950 --> 00:36:00.960 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman good morning
 
00:36:03.430 --> 00:36:03.440 align:start position:0%
good morning um you had mentioned that
 
00:36:06.390 --> 00:36:06.400 align:start position:0%
um the may filing period would be of
 
00:36:09.349 --> 00:36:09.359 align:start position:0%
concern for local election officials and
 
00:36:11.829 --> 00:36:11.839 align:start position:0%
i know that was a concern
 
00:36:13.750 --> 00:36:13.760 align:start position:0%
was filing period ended up being in
 
00:36:16.390 --> 00:36:16.400 align:start position:0%
march for june primary
 
00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:17.680 align:start position:0%
and i don't know if you can answer this
 
00:36:19.589 --> 00:36:19.599 align:start position:0%
question obviously you're not a local
 
00:36:20.950 --> 00:36:20.960 align:start position:0%
election official but do you have any
 
00:36:22.870 --> 00:36:22.880 align:start position:0%
insight in terms of how
 
00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:24.640 align:start position:0%
town clerks and other local election
 
00:36:26.230 --> 00:36:26.240 align:start position:0%
officials around the state generally
 
00:36:29.829 --> 00:36:29.839 align:start position:0%
regard a possible state primary change
 
00:36:32.230 --> 00:36:32.240 align:start position:0%
we have not pulled them i don't know but
 
00:36:35.270 --> 00:36:35.280 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm sure that those that have the
 
00:36:37.109 --> 00:36:37.119 align:start position:0%
may elections which obviously is a much
 
00:36:37.119 --> 00:36:38.150 align:start position:0%
may elections which obviously is a much
smaller

00:36:38.150 --> 00:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
smaller
 
00:36:40.390 --> 00:36:40.400 align:start position:0%
portion of our municipalities but we do
 
00:36:41.829 --> 00:36:41.839 align:start position:0%
have municipalities that use that
 
00:36:44.230 --> 00:36:44.240 align:start position:0%
alternate date in may
 
00:36:46.390 --> 00:36:46.400 align:start position:0%
those town clerks i'm sure
 
00:36:48.550 --> 00:36:48.560 align:start position:0%
would be concerned they would be um
 
00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:51.680 align:start position:0%
outnumbered by by others but uh for for
 
00:36:53.430 --> 00:36:53.440 align:start position:0%
those that do have the may
 
00:36:55.829 --> 00:36:55.839 align:start position:0%
uh may day this
 
00:36:58.790 --> 00:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
puts more work into a um into a shorter
 
00:37:00.310 --> 00:37:00.320 align:start position:0%

from the secretary of state thank you
for

00:38:52.230 --> 00:38:52.240 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:39:00.470 --> 00:39:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:02.960 align:start position:0%
there we go
 
00:39:04.630 --> 00:39:04.640 align:start position:0%
once again good morning uh patricia
 
00:39:06.150 --> 00:39:06.160 align:start position:0%
lovejoy at the secretary of state's
 
00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:07.109 align:start position:0%
lovejoy at the secretary of state's
office

00:39:07.109 --> 00:39:07.119 align:start position:0%
office
 
00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
uh this bill is related to um
 
00:39:12.950 --> 00:39:12.960 align:start position:0%
the electronic polls
 
00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:13.750 align:start position:0%
the electronic polls
the

00:39:13.750 --> 00:39:13.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:15.670 align:start position:0%
the
ebooks

00:39:15.670 --> 00:39:15.680 align:start position:0%
ebooks
 
00:39:18.069 --> 00:39:18.079 align:start position:0%
it's a simple correction
 
00:39:21.510 --> 00:39:21.520 align:start position:0%
it relates to the maximum time lag
 
00:39:23.670 --> 00:39:23.680 align:start position:0%
between when the electronic poll books
 
00:39:26.310 --> 00:39:26.320 align:start position:0%
have to be updated with the paper um
 
00:39:29.030 --> 00:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
books and it changes it from 10 to 30
 
00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:30.390 align:start position:0%
books and it changes it from 10 to 30
minutes

00:39:30.390 --> 00:39:30.400 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
00:39:33.270 --> 00:39:33.280 align:start position:0%
after a thorough e poll book pilot
 
00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:35.680 align:start position:0%
program the general court enacted a
 
00:39:39.109 --> 00:39:39.119 align:start position:0%
permanent electronic poll book program
 
00:39:41.109 --> 00:39:41.119 align:start position:0%
and after being in effect for
 
00:39:42.630 --> 00:39:42.640 align:start position:0%
several municipalities and special
 
00:39:45.589 --> 00:39:45.599 align:start position:0%
elections the local clerks and election
 
00:39:47.270 --> 00:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
officials brought to light a few things
 
00:39:49.670 --> 00:39:49.680 align:start position:0%
that they um wish to have changed and
 
00:39:53.349 --> 00:39:53.359 align:start position:0%
this is the uh the major one so it gives
 
00:39:55.990 --> 00:39:56.000 align:start position:0%
poll workers a little additional time
 
00:39:58.310 --> 00:39:58.320 align:start position:0%
more and more towns have been using the
 
00:40:00.630 --> 00:40:00.640 align:start position:0%
e-pole books and those that have used it
 
00:40:01.750 --> 00:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
have been
 
00:40:04.150 --> 00:40:04.160 align:start position:0%
extremely happy with it
 
00:40:06.309 --> 00:40:06.319 align:start position:0%
i expect that as time goes by more and
 
00:40:07.829 --> 00:40:07.839 align:start position:0%
more towns will be
 
00:40:10.630 --> 00:40:10.640 align:start position:0%
will be adopting it it moves the lines
 
00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:11.829 align:start position:0%
will be adopting it it moves the lines
through

00:40:11.829 --> 00:40:11.839 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
much much more quickly
 
00:40:18.150 --> 00:40:18.160 align:start position:0%
we do have a rfp out that we expect is
 
00:40:19.349 --> 00:40:19.359 align:start position:0%
going to
 
00:40:19.359 --> 00:40:20.710 align:start position:0%
going to
um

00:40:20.710 --> 00:40:20.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:22.309 --> 00:40:22.319 align:start position:0%
that the work will be done in time for
 
00:40:25.750 --> 00:40:25.760 align:start position:0%
this year's election which will allow
 
00:40:28.309 --> 00:40:28.319 align:start position:0%
the e-pull books to
 
00:40:30.230 --> 00:40:30.240 align:start position:0%
automatically update the voter
 
00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:32.720 align:start position:0%
registration system currently right now
 
00:40:34.230 --> 00:40:34.240 align:start position:0%
what your town
 
00:40:35.589 --> 00:40:35.599 align:start position:0%
which your
 
00:40:38.150 --> 00:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
supervisors of the checklist do at the
 
00:40:40.069 --> 00:40:40.079 align:start position:0%
end of each election
 
00:40:41.990 --> 00:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
if i'm sure you were all familiar with
 
00:40:44.790 --> 00:40:44.800 align:start position:0%
the check-in forms and there is a
 
00:40:46.790 --> 00:40:46.800 align:start position:0%
little scam
 
00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:48.069 align:start position:0%
little scam
barcode

00:40:48.069 --> 00:40:48.079 align:start position:0%
barcode
 
00:40:50.150 --> 00:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
and the supervisors the checklist
 
00:40:53.030 --> 00:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
afterward have to go through
 
00:40:55.430 --> 00:40:55.440 align:start position:0%
you know line by line everyone who voted
 
00:40:57.589 --> 00:40:57.599 align:start position:0%
and scan the um
 
00:40:59.910 --> 00:40:59.920 align:start position:0%
scan it into the
 
00:41:02.069 --> 00:41:02.079 align:start position:0%
voter registration system
 
00:41:04.150 --> 00:41:04.160 align:start position:0%
with the new changes that will be made
 
00:41:07.430 --> 00:41:07.440 align:start position:0%
to the e-poll book which we are
 
00:41:10.630 --> 00:41:10.640 align:start position:0%
quite sure will be um available for this
 
00:41:12.550 --> 00:41:12.560 align:start position:0%
this november the system will
 
00:41:14.630 --> 00:41:14.640 align:start position:0%
automatically update it and that will
 
00:41:17.030 --> 00:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
include if somebody has now if you've
 
00:41:18.870 --> 00:41:18.880 align:start position:0%
used a um
 
00:41:21.990 --> 00:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
a massachusetts license as your id
 
00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
it is we note on the
 
00:41:28.390 --> 00:41:28.400 align:start position:0%
on the checklist that it was from
 
00:41:30.309 --> 00:41:30.319 align:start position:0%
massachusetts even that kind of
 
00:41:33.030 --> 00:41:33.040 align:start position:0%
information will be updated
 
00:41:35.589 --> 00:41:35.599 align:start position:0%
automatically through the um poll books
 
00:41:37.990 --> 00:41:38.000 align:start position:0%
so this is really a relatively simple
 
00:41:40.390 --> 00:41:40.400 align:start position:0%
change of uh giving them a little bit of
 
00:41:43.109 --> 00:41:43.119 align:start position:0%
additional time a time lag between
 
00:41:45.109 --> 00:41:45.119 align:start position:0%
updating the
 
00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:48.560 align:start position:0%
poll books and the paper back up
 
00:41:49.510 --> 00:41:49.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:41:53.829 --> 00:41:53.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:57.349 --> 00:41:57.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:58.870 --> 00:41:58.880 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman and thank you

how well backed up is it electronically
 
00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:12.630 align:start position:0%
how well backed up is it electronically
um

00:42:12.630 --> 00:42:12.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:15.670 --> 00:42:15.680 align:start position:0%
it is uh i'm not as much of a tech i
 
00:42:18.550 --> 00:42:18.560 align:start position:0%
can't give you the exact technical um
 
00:42:21.349 --> 00:42:21.359 align:start position:0%
terms but it is very well um backed up
 
00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
they have been
 
00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:23.750 align:start position:0%
they have been
um

00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:26.150 --> 00:42:26.160 align:start position:0%
they have been tested significantly and
 
00:42:27.670 --> 00:42:27.680 align:start position:0%
that's why there is a
 
00:42:30.550 --> 00:42:30.560 align:start position:0%
continual backup also with the paper
 
00:42:32.390 --> 00:42:32.400 align:start position:0%
with the paper
 
00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:33.750 align:start position:0%

checklist
 
00:42:36.390 --> 00:42:36.400 align:start position:0%
uh follow-up follow-up thank you
 
00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:37.440 align:start position:0%
so if
 
00:42:40.230 --> 00:42:40.240 align:start position:0%
so so if the primary electronic system
 
00:42:42.950 --> 00:42:42.960 align:start position:0%
fails within that 30 minutes it is
 
00:42:44.309 --> 00:42:44.319 align:start position:0%
already thoroughly backed up
 
00:42:46.069 --> 00:42:46.079 align:start position:0%
electronically it's backed up
 
00:42:47.829 --> 00:42:47.839 align:start position:0%
electronically and we are printing out
 
00:42:51.910 --> 00:42:51.920 align:start position:0%
the um the paper one also okay thank you
 
00:42:55.430 --> 00:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:57.670 --> 00:42:57.680 align:start position:0%
uh i have one how many towns have used
 
00:42:59.829 --> 00:42:59.839 align:start position:0%
it do you know i don't have the the
 
00:43:01.430 --> 00:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
number off the top of my head i mean are
 
00:43:03.109 --> 00:43:03.119 align:start position:0%
we talking two are we talking oh no
 
00:43:04.390 --> 00:43:04.400 align:start position:0%
there's more than there's more than that
 
00:43:06.230 --> 00:43:06.240 align:start position:0%
there were several that started doing
 
00:43:07.670 --> 00:43:07.680 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:08.550 align:start position:0%
the um
uh

00:43:08.550 --> 00:43:08.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:43:10.870 --> 00:43:10.880 align:start position:0%
the original testing i don't know how
 
00:43:12.470 --> 00:43:12.480 align:start position:0%
many there are additional ones that have
 
00:43:14.150 --> 00:43:14.160 align:start position:0%
signed up for for this year but i don't
 
00:43:15.589 --> 00:43:15.599 align:start position:0%
have that number i can get that to you
 
00:43:19.109 --> 00:43:19.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:20.870 --> 00:43:20.880 align:start position:0%
all right i'm not seeing any ques more
 
00:43:22.870 --> 00:43:22.880 align:start position:0%
questions so thank you very much also
 
00:43:23.910 --> 00:43:23.920 align:start position:0%
signed up
 
00:43:25.990 --> 00:43:26.000 align:start position:0%
for this uh for speaking on this is
 
00:43:31.510 --> 00:43:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:33.109 --> 00:43:33.119 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and h grace from
 
00:43:35.030 --> 00:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire municipal association
 
00:43:37.270 --> 00:43:37.280 align:start position:0%
we support this
 
00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:38.390 align:start position:0%
we support this
change

00:43:38.390 --> 00:43:38.400 align:start position:0%
change
 
00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:39.750 align:start position:0%
change
as

00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:39.760 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:43:42.309 --> 00:43:42.319 align:start position:0%
the deputy secretary of state stated um
 
00:43:45.349 --> 00:43:45.359 align:start position:0%
this simply increases the amount of time
 
00:43:47.510 --> 00:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
um for the uh
 
00:43:49.990 --> 00:43:50.000 align:start position:0%
parallel uh check-in
 
00:43:52.069 --> 00:43:52.079 align:start position:0%
lag time to be no more than 30 minutes
 
00:43:53.990 --> 00:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
instead of the current 10 and my
 
00:43:56.069 --> 00:43:56.079 align:start position:0%
understanding for that request is that
 
00:43:57.670 --> 00:43:57.680 align:start position:0%
it was simply
 
00:43:59.109 --> 00:43:59.119 align:start position:0%
because typically
 
00:44:00.870 --> 00:44:00.880 align:start position:0%
when an issue arises as a technical
 
00:44:01.990 --> 00:44:02.000 align:start position:0%
issue and they're trying to troubleshoot
 
00:44:03.349 --> 00:44:03.359 align:start position:0%
it might take a little bit more than 10
 
00:44:03.359 --> 00:44:05.430 align:start position:0%
it might take a little bit more than 10
minutes

00:44:05.430 --> 00:44:05.440 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
00:44:06.870 --> 00:44:06.880 align:start position:0%
as far as
 
00:44:08.630 --> 00:44:08.640 align:start position:0%
the chair's question for movement
 
00:44:11.030 --> 00:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
towards electronic poll books
 
00:44:13.190 --> 00:44:13.200 align:start position:0%
i can tell you that every year nhma does
 
00:44:14.870 --> 00:44:14.880 align:start position:0%
do a training for
 
00:44:16.790 --> 00:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
moderators for the past several years
 
00:44:18.790 --> 00:44:18.800 align:start position:0%
we've emphasized
 
00:44:21.030 --> 00:44:21.040 align:start position:0%
kind of this electronic poll book shift
 
00:44:22.390 --> 00:44:22.400 align:start position:0%
and usage
 
00:44:24.710 --> 00:44:24.720 align:start position:0%
and there's been an incredibly high
 
00:44:26.790 --> 00:44:26.800 align:start position:0%
amount of interest in that
 
00:44:28.870 --> 00:44:28.880 align:start position:0%
because of the speed at which that can
 
00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:29.910 align:start position:0%
because of the speed at which that can
increase

00:44:29.910 --> 00:44:29.920 align:start position:0%
increase
 
00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:31.589 align:start position:0%
increase

00:44:31.589 --> 00:44:31.599 align:start position:0%
elections
 
00:44:33.829 --> 00:44:33.839 align:start position:0%
and ensure that
 
00:44:35.990 --> 00:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
that everything is being done correctly
 
00:44:38.390 --> 00:44:38.400 align:start position:0%
and at the same time so i would imagine
 
00:44:40.230 --> 00:44:40.240 align:start position:0%
that the next few years we'll see most
 
00:44:42.309 --> 00:44:42.319 align:start position:0%
municipalities that have
 
00:44:44.470 --> 00:44:44.480 align:start position:0%
uh you know good internet connectivity
 
00:44:47.510 --> 00:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
at their polling locations be uh try to
 
00:44:51.829 --> 00:44:51.839 align:start position:0%
shift towards electronic poll books
 
00:44:54.069 --> 00:44:54.079 align:start position:0%

00:45:18.470 --> 00:45:18.480 align:start position:0%
is 365 relative to absentee
 
00:45:21.270 --> 00:45:21.280 align:start position:0%

01:01:40.640 --> 01:02:10.870 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:02:10.870 --> 01:02:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:14.309 --> 01:02:14.319 align:start position:0%
all right it is 10 30 by at least one of
 
01:02:17.109 --> 01:02:17.119 align:start position:0%
the timepieces available to me

outer envelope and here to present the
 
01:02:28.710 --> 01:02:28.720 align:start position:0%

uh thank you for the record even though
 
01:02:36.390 --> 01:02:36.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:38.950 --> 01:02:38.960 align:start position:0%

01:02:46.839 --> 01:02:48.470 align:start position:0%
11 to alton barnes and gilmanton
um

01:02:48.470 --> 01:02:48.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:49.670 --> 01:02:49.680 align:start position:0%
one of the great
 
01:02:52.789 --> 01:02:52.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:54.309 --> 01:02:54.319 align:start position:0%
that we had
 
01:02:56.309 --> 01:02:56.319 align:start position:0%
during the past elections was the
 
01:02:58.630 --> 01:02:58.640 align:start position:0%
ability to pre-process
 
01:03:00.789 --> 01:03:00.799 align:start position:0%
the absentee ballots it was well
 
01:03:04.309 --> 01:03:04.319 align:start position:0%
received by moderators well received by
 
01:03:07.430 --> 01:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:09.670 --> 01:03:09.680 align:start position:0%
i tell people that a lot of the things
 
01:03:11.190 --> 01:03:11.200 align:start position:0%
that they did about marking the
 
01:03:13.349 --> 01:03:13.359 align:start position:0%
checklist can actually be done
 
01:03:13.359 --> 01:03:15.589 align:start position:0%
checklist can actually be done
automatically

01:03:15.589 --> 01:03:15.599 align:start position:0%
automatically
 
01:03:15.599 --> 01:03:16.870 align:start position:0%
automatically
but

01:03:16.870 --> 01:03:16.880 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:03:19.190 --> 01:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
the other thing is is the absentee
 
01:03:21.349 --> 01:03:21.359 align:start position:0%
ballots being able to open
 
01:03:24.950 --> 01:03:24.960 align:start position:0%
that outer envelope and be able to
 
01:03:27.190 --> 01:03:27.200 align:start position:0%
identify the signatures
 
01:03:29.910 --> 01:03:29.920 align:start position:0%
one of the things that was most
 
01:03:33.109 --> 01:03:33.119 align:start position:0%
beneficial to the voter was the ability
 
01:03:34.630 --> 01:03:34.640 align:start position:0%
to correct
 
01:03:36.710 --> 01:03:36.720 align:start position:0%
any errors that were found either
 
01:03:38.390 --> 01:03:38.400 align:start position:0%
missing signatures
 
01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:39.670 align:start position:0%
missing signatures
or

01:03:39.670 --> 01:03:39.680 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:40.549 align:start position:0%
or
other

01:03:40.549 --> 01:03:40.559 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:03:42.630 --> 01:03:42.640 align:start position:0%
problems with that ballot
 
01:03:45.589 --> 01:03:45.599 align:start position:0%
so the question came up is okay well why
 
01:03:47.829 --> 01:03:47.839 align:start position:0%
do we have an outer envelope
 
01:03:49.670 --> 01:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
the only reason we have our outer
 
01:03:51.270 --> 01:03:51.280 align:start position:0%
envelope really
 
01:03:53.910 --> 01:03:53.920 align:start position:0%
from what i've been able to find out is
 
01:03:55.670 --> 01:03:55.680 align:start position:0%
when i go put it in the mail i need a
 
01:03:59.190 --> 01:03:59.200 align:start position:0%
place to put the stamps and the address
 
01:04:02.549 --> 01:04:02.559 align:start position:0%
okay well then a person who votes at the
 
01:04:05.109 --> 01:04:05.119 align:start position:0%
city or town hall in person why do they
 
01:04:08.069 --> 01:04:08.079 align:start position:0%
need an honorable
 
01:04:11.029 --> 01:04:11.039 align:start position:0%
answer is they don't
 
01:04:13.510 --> 01:04:13.520 align:start position:0%
and if they don't have the outer
 
01:04:15.990 --> 01:04:16.000 align:start position:0%
envelope they hand me back the ballot i
 
01:04:18.069 --> 01:04:18.079 align:start position:0%
can look at the signature if i'm the
 
01:04:18.079 --> 01:04:20.309 align:start position:0%
can look at the signature if i'm the
clerk

01:04:20.309 --> 01:04:20.319 align:start position:0%
clerk
 
01:04:21.430 --> 01:04:21.440 align:start position:0%
and say
 
01:04:23.109 --> 01:04:23.119 align:start position:0%
well you know
 
01:04:25.670 --> 01:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
you probably ought to you know sign it
 
01:04:27.589 --> 01:04:27.599 align:start position:0%
down here where you're supposed to or
 
01:04:30.150 --> 01:04:30.160 align:start position:0%
whatever else is the problem
 
01:04:32.710 --> 01:04:32.720 align:start position:0%
and give them that ability to correct
 
01:04:34.870 --> 01:04:34.880 align:start position:0%
their signature right there
 
01:04:37.190 --> 01:04:37.200 align:start position:0%
if one comes in in the mail there's no
 
01:04:40.309 --> 01:04:40.319 align:start position:0%
reason for it to be part of the absentee
 
01:04:42.950 --> 01:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
ballot process which is the way the law
 
01:04:45.670 --> 01:04:45.680 align:start position:0%
was structured prior to this
 
01:04:47.670 --> 01:04:47.680 align:start position:0%
the clerk ought to be able to open those
 
01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:49.349 align:start position:0%
the clerk ought to be able to open those
envelopes

01:04:49.349 --> 01:04:49.359 align:start position:0%
envelopes
 
01:04:52.470 --> 01:04:52.480 align:start position:0%
attach all the appropriate forms
 
01:04:55.430 --> 01:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
and the disability people will say that
 
01:04:58.069 --> 01:04:58.079 align:start position:0%
that uh amendment that they would like
 
01:04:59.910 --> 01:04:59.920 align:start position:0%
to uh this bill
 
01:05:01.510 --> 01:05:01.520 align:start position:0%
and hopefully i've talked them out of
 
01:05:04.549 --> 01:05:04.559 align:start position:0%
some of it but there is a form right now
 
01:05:06.630 --> 01:05:06.640 align:start position:0%
and that could be attached also along
 
01:05:09.270 --> 01:05:09.280 align:start position:0%
with the application and i'm sure that
 
01:05:11.029 --> 01:05:11.039 align:start position:0%
if they choose to they'll be able to
 
01:05:13.430 --> 01:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
testify on that but again
 
01:05:15.670 --> 01:05:15.680 align:start position:0%
you know that's a training thing but
 
01:05:18.309 --> 01:05:18.319 align:start position:0%
the application can be stapled to it
 
01:05:21.109 --> 01:05:21.119 align:start position:0%
we were asked by the clerks to also
 
01:05:22.789 --> 01:05:22.799 align:start position:0%
include the address
 
01:05:25.190 --> 01:05:25.200 align:start position:0%
so that it was easier
 
01:05:27.670 --> 01:05:27.680 align:start position:0%
i'm told that children right now
 
01:05:30.470 --> 01:05:30.480 align:start position:0%
in schools are taught how to make a
 
01:05:33.109 --> 01:05:33.119 align:start position:0%
cursive first letter of their first name
 
01:05:35.190 --> 01:05:35.200 align:start position:0%
and a cursive first letter of their last
 
01:05:38.950 --> 01:05:38.960 align:start position:0%
name and then make a squiggle
 
01:05:40.870 --> 01:05:40.880 align:start position:0%
believe it or not that's what i've been
 
01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:41.750 align:start position:0%
believe it or not that's what i've been
told

01:05:41.750 --> 01:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
told
 
01:05:42.789 --> 01:05:42.799 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:05:45.029 --> 01:05:45.039 align:start position:0%
trying to decipher
 
01:05:46.390 --> 01:05:46.400 align:start position:0%
some of those
 
01:05:47.990 --> 01:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to put air quotes around
 
01:05:51.510 --> 01:05:51.520 align:start position:0%
it signatures are very difficult
 
01:05:53.430 --> 01:05:53.440 align:start position:0%
so having the address in there which was
 
01:05:55.109 --> 01:05:55.119 align:start position:0%
added to the bill
 
01:05:57.829 --> 01:05:57.839 align:start position:0%
will be very helpful to the clerks
 
01:05:59.430 --> 01:05:59.440 align:start position:0%
this also
 
01:06:01.829 --> 01:06:01.839 align:start position:0%
because we have an injunction against
 
01:06:03.750 --> 01:06:03.760 align:start position:0%
looking at the signatures because of a
 
01:06:05.750 --> 01:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
court order
 
01:06:07.589 --> 01:06:07.599 align:start position:0%
the two things that the court said if
 
01:06:10.069 --> 01:06:10.079 align:start position:0%
you want to go back and check signatures
 
01:06:12.230 --> 01:06:12.240 align:start position:0%
the things that you need to do
 
01:06:13.750 --> 01:06:13.760 align:start position:0%
is one
 
01:06:16.630 --> 01:06:16.640 align:start position:0%
give the voter the ability to correct if
 
01:06:19.750 --> 01:06:19.760 align:start position:0%
they did something wrong
 
01:06:21.670 --> 01:06:21.680 align:start position:0%
this does that
 
01:06:24.069 --> 01:06:24.079 align:start position:0%
and the other thing is training in the
 
01:06:24.079 --> 01:06:25.349 align:start position:0%
and the other thing is training in the
signatures

01:06:25.349 --> 01:06:25.359 align:start position:0%
signatures
 
01:06:27.190 --> 01:06:27.200 align:start position:0%
and that would be something that the
 
01:06:29.349 --> 01:06:29.359 align:start position:0%
secretary of state would do
 
01:06:31.750 --> 01:06:31.760 align:start position:0%
to those individuals
 
01:06:34.150 --> 01:06:34.160 align:start position:0%
and at that time
 
01:06:36.230 --> 01:06:36.240 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state probably would be
 
01:06:37.829 --> 01:06:37.839 align:start position:0%
able to
 
01:06:39.750 --> 01:06:39.760 align:start position:0%
petition the court to lift the court
 
01:06:41.430 --> 01:06:41.440 align:start position:0%
order and
 
01:06:43.190 --> 01:06:43.200 align:start position:0%
again go back to
 
01:06:46.150 --> 01:06:46.160 align:start position:0%
at least reviewing those signatures
 
01:06:48.150 --> 01:06:48.160 align:start position:0%
on that note i want to tell you in the
 
01:06:51.109 --> 01:06:51.119 align:start position:0%
20 plus years that i was a moderator
 
01:06:53.910 --> 01:06:53.920 align:start position:0%
i used to look for reasons to accept the
 
01:06:56.710 --> 01:06:56.720 align:start position:0%
signatures not reasons to reject the
 
01:06:56.720 --> 01:06:58.150 align:start position:0%
signatures not reasons to reject the
signatures

01:06:58.150 --> 01:06:58.160 align:start position:0%
signatures
 
01:06:59.910 --> 01:06:59.920 align:start position:0%
which is very important when we're
 
01:07:01.349 --> 01:07:01.359 align:start position:0%
looking at those
 
01:07:03.029 --> 01:07:03.039 align:start position:0%
these affidavits
 
01:07:05.670 --> 01:07:05.680 align:start position:0%
i used to go to the original application
 
01:07:08.630 --> 01:07:08.640 align:start position:0%
which used to be at the polls
 
01:07:10.710 --> 01:07:10.720 align:start position:0%
and look at the printing because
 
01:07:13.349 --> 01:07:13.359 align:start position:0%
sometimes the printing told me more
 
01:07:15.270 --> 01:07:15.280 align:start position:0%
about that person
 
01:07:18.710 --> 01:07:18.720 align:start position:0%
and if he had the little circle here or
 
01:07:21.029 --> 01:07:21.039 align:start position:0%
a straight line here
 
01:07:25.109 --> 01:07:25.119 align:start position:0%
that i use that as a reason to say that
 
01:07:26.470 --> 01:07:26.480 align:start position:0%
there is
 
01:07:28.069 --> 01:07:28.079 align:start position:0%
more evidence than not that the
 
01:07:29.990 --> 01:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
signature is made by the right
 
01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:31.270 align:start position:0%
signature is made by the right
individual

01:07:31.270 --> 01:07:31.280 align:start position:0%
individual
 
01:07:34.150 --> 01:07:34.160 align:start position:0%
and with that i will
 
01:07:36.230 --> 01:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
offer myself for other
 
01:07:38.549 --> 01:07:38.559 align:start position:0%
questions before i run back across the
 
01:07:38.559 --> 01:07:39.589 align:start position:0%
questions before i run back across the
street

01:07:39.589 --> 01:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
street
 
01:07:44.870 --> 01:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:46.390 --> 01:07:46.400 align:start position:0%
questions from committee members for
 
01:07:50.069 --> 01:07:50.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:51.990 --> 01:07:52.000 align:start position:0%

i got it right
 
01:08:16.480 --> 01:08:17.430 align:start position:0%
i got it right
welcome

01:08:17.430 --> 01:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
01:08:19.349 --> 01:08:19.359 align:start position:0%
thank you good morning good morning for
 
01:08:21.189 --> 01:08:21.199 align:start position:0%
the record i'm karen rosenberg i'm the
 
01:08:23.189 --> 01:08:23.199 align:start position:0%
policy director at disability rights
 
01:08:25.030 --> 01:08:25.040 align:start position:0%
center and this is my colleague i'm
 
01:08:26.470 --> 01:08:26.480 align:start position:0%
james egram a staff attorney at
 
01:08:28.630 --> 01:08:28.640 align:start position:0%
disability rights center
 
01:08:30.630 --> 01:08:30.640 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:08:31.990 --> 01:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
i think i
 
01:08:34.309 --> 01:08:34.319 align:start position:0%
violated a prime directive which is the
 
01:08:37.430 --> 01:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
kiss role keep it simple and stupid
 
01:08:39.269 --> 01:08:39.279 align:start position:0%
when i discussed an issue that our
 
01:08:42.070 --> 01:08:42.080 align:start position:0%
office identified with this bill
 
01:08:44.709 --> 01:08:44.719 align:start position:0%
so i i brought james here to explain to
 
01:08:46.789 --> 01:08:46.799 align:start position:0%
you why we um
 
01:08:47.990 --> 01:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
think that
 
01:08:50.390 --> 01:08:50.400 align:start position:0%
although the bill was intended to just
 
01:08:52.470 --> 01:08:52.480 align:start position:0%
eliminate the rule for the
 
01:08:54.550 --> 01:08:54.560 align:start position:0%
requirement of the outer envelope that
 
01:08:57.189 --> 01:08:57.199 align:start position:0%
it there may be some risk without a tiny
 
01:09:00.630 --> 01:09:00.640 align:start position:0%
adjustment um that certain votes may be
 
01:09:02.550 --> 01:09:02.560 align:start position:0%
not counted for people with disabilities
 
01:09:04.149 --> 01:09:04.159 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to have james explain that
 
01:09:05.829 --> 01:09:05.839 align:start position:0%
to you because he knows this far better
 
01:09:08.390 --> 01:09:08.400 align:start position:0%
than i do all right thank you sure good
 
01:09:10.550 --> 01:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
morning um so the concern with the bill
 
01:09:11.990 --> 01:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
that we have as written is that it
 
01:09:13.749 --> 01:09:13.759 align:start position:0%
doesn't account for a new accessible
 
01:09:15.669 --> 01:09:15.679 align:start position:0%
absentee voting program that was put
 
01:09:17.510 --> 01:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
into place by the secretary of state in
 
01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:19.030 align:start position:0%
into place by the secretary of state in
2020.

01:09:19.030 --> 01:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
2020.
 
01:09:20.470 --> 01:09:20.480 align:start position:0%
essentially the program allows people
 
01:09:22.789 --> 01:09:22.799 align:start position:0%
with print disabilities who are blind or
 
01:09:24.789 --> 01:09:24.799 align:start position:0%
who are otherwise unable to fill out a
 
01:09:26.709 --> 01:09:26.719 align:start position:0%
paper ballot on their own
 
01:09:29.430 --> 01:09:29.440 align:start position:0%
to complete a ballot um privately and
 
01:09:29.440 --> 01:09:31.189 align:start position:0%
to complete a ballot um privately and
independently

01:09:31.189 --> 01:09:31.199 align:start position:0%
independently
 
01:09:33.510 --> 01:09:33.520 align:start position:0%
so without getting too into the weeds
 
01:09:36.789 --> 01:09:36.799 align:start position:0%
about this accessible absentee program
 
01:09:38.870 --> 01:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
basically eligible voters request that a
 
01:09:41.030 --> 01:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
ballot is sent to them and along with
 
01:09:43.110 --> 01:09:43.120 align:start position:0%
the ballot is a separate uh voter
 
01:09:45.510 --> 01:09:45.520 align:start position:0%
affidavit that is sent to them the voter
 
01:09:47.590 --> 01:09:47.600 align:start position:0%
will fill out the affidavit and fill out
 
01:09:49.349 --> 01:09:49.359 align:start position:0%
their ballot electronically they print
 
01:09:51.349 --> 01:09:51.359 align:start position:0%
out a piece of paper with the ballot
 
01:09:54.310 --> 01:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
print out a piece of paper with their
 
01:09:57.189 --> 01:09:57.199 align:start position:0%
affidavit and they put the ballot inside
 
01:09:58.950 --> 01:09:58.960 align:start position:0%
the affidavit envelope just like every
 
01:10:01.110 --> 01:10:01.120 align:start position:0%
other voter does but the instructions
 
01:10:02.630 --> 01:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
that the secretary of state's office
 
01:10:04.470 --> 01:10:04.480 align:start position:0%
give to voters says that they should
 
01:10:06.229 --> 01:10:06.239 align:start position:0%
take that affidavit that separate
 
01:10:08.310 --> 01:10:08.320 align:start position:0%
printed affidavit and put that in the
 
01:10:10.470 --> 01:10:10.480 align:start position:0%
outer mailing envelope
 
01:10:12.870 --> 01:10:12.880 align:start position:0%
um because people these folks have print
 
01:10:14.470 --> 01:10:14.480 align:start position:0%
disabilities they're not able to sign
 
01:10:16.470 --> 01:10:16.480 align:start position:0%
the envelopes themselves the affidavit
 
01:10:18.950 --> 01:10:18.960 align:start position:0%
envelope like most voters so in lieu of
 
01:10:21.110 --> 01:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
that they fill out a separate affidavit
 
01:10:23.510 --> 01:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
put it inside the mailing envelope and
 
01:10:25.270 --> 01:10:25.280 align:start position:0%
either hand deliver it or they mail it
 
01:10:28.630 --> 01:10:28.640 align:start position:0%
to the city or town clerk
 
01:10:30.790 --> 01:10:30.800 align:start position:0%
now the problem with well it's not
 
01:10:32.149 --> 01:10:32.159 align:start position:0%
really a problem but it's just maybe
 
01:10:34.709 --> 01:10:34.719 align:start position:0%
perhaps a small oversight with the bill
 
01:10:37.830 --> 01:10:37.840 align:start position:0%
is that the um you know the the
 
01:10:39.590 --> 01:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
the voters are instructed to put it in
 
01:10:41.430 --> 01:10:41.440 align:start position:0%
the outer envelope and the state
 
01:10:43.110 --> 01:10:43.120 align:start position:0%
election officials are instructed that
 
01:10:44.630 --> 01:10:44.640 align:start position:0%
this affidavit is going to come
 
01:10:46.870 --> 01:10:46.880 align:start position:0%
separately in that outer envelope as
 
01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:47.830 align:start position:0%
separately in that outer envelope as
well

01:10:47.830 --> 01:10:47.840 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:10:49.430 --> 01:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
however the bill doesn't have any
 
01:10:51.990 --> 01:10:52.000 align:start position:0%
guidance in it to tell elected officials
 
01:10:53.830 --> 01:10:53.840 align:start position:0%
that they need to somehow secure this
 
01:10:56.790 --> 01:10:56.800 align:start position:0%
affidavit to the affidavit envelope so
 
01:10:59.030 --> 01:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
as a consequence what might happen
 
01:11:00.790 --> 01:11:00.800 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:11:02.149 --> 01:11:02.159 align:start position:0%
the the town clerk when they're
 
01:11:04.870 --> 01:11:04.880 align:start position:0%
pre-processing the outer envelopes
 
01:11:07.030 --> 01:11:07.040 align:start position:0%
something may happen to that affidavit
 
01:11:09.270 --> 01:11:09.280 align:start position:0%
and it may not be attached properly or
 
01:11:11.990 --> 01:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
affects to that inner affidavit envelope
 
01:11:14.709 --> 01:11:14.719 align:start position:0%
and when that happens come election day
 
01:11:16.229 --> 01:11:16.239 align:start position:0%
that ballot could be tossed because
 
01:11:18.390 --> 01:11:18.400 align:start position:0%
there's no signature on the affidavit
 
01:11:19.990 --> 01:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
envelope so even though the voter had
 
01:11:22.390 --> 01:11:22.400 align:start position:0%
filled out their affidavit in accordance
 
01:11:23.910 --> 01:11:23.920 align:start position:0%
with the instructions provided to them
 
01:11:25.990 --> 01:11:26.000 align:start position:0%
by the secretary's office
 
01:11:29.990 --> 01:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
their vote may not count and so
 
01:11:32.390 --> 01:11:32.400 align:start position:0%
we just wanted to address that concern
 
01:11:35.830 --> 01:11:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:38.790 --> 01:11:38.800 align:start position:0%
so i actually brought a one paragraph
 
01:11:40.149 --> 01:11:40.159 align:start position:0%
potential amendment that you might
 
01:11:42.310 --> 01:11:42.320 align:start position:0%
consider um which i provided to
 
01:11:43.990 --> 01:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
representative griffin but i have copies
 
01:11:46.310 --> 01:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
for you all if i don't think i actually
 
01:11:47.510 --> 01:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
took it
 
01:11:49.669 --> 01:11:49.679 align:start position:0%
because i have this thing about getting
 
01:11:51.430 --> 01:11:51.440 align:start position:0%
paper before it's time to look at it so
 
01:11:52.790 --> 01:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
if you can give it to representative
 
01:11:55.189 --> 01:11:55.199 align:start position:0%
quayley and then have him pass it to
 
01:11:56.950 --> 01:11:56.960 align:start position:0%
representative hayward and we'll we'll
 
01:11:58.790 --> 01:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
get it around i'm having a little
 
01:12:00.870 --> 01:12:00.880 align:start position:0%
trouble putting my hands around what it
 
01:12:02.950 --> 01:12:02.960 align:start position:0%
is you're talking you're talking about
 
01:12:05.350 --> 01:12:05.360 align:start position:0%
as far as the issue
 
01:12:08.390 --> 01:12:08.400 align:start position:0%
um and representative bergeron before i
 
01:12:10.630 --> 01:12:10.640 align:start position:0%
open it up to further questions do we
 
01:12:12.870 --> 01:12:12.880 align:start position:0%
have anything currently in a bill that
 
01:12:16.870 --> 01:12:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:20.790 --> 01:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:22.149 --> 01:12:22.159 align:start position:0%
i can't recall seeing any house or
 
01:12:23.910 --> 01:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
senate bills that dealt with a matter of
 
01:12:26.310 --> 01:12:26.320 align:start position:0%
pre-processing and the pre-processing
 
01:12:28.950 --> 01:12:28.960 align:start position:0%
expired under current law given the the
 
01:12:31.750 --> 01:12:31.760 align:start position:0%
way it was passed for 2020 correct
 
01:12:31.760 --> 01:12:32.709 align:start position:0%
way it was passed for 2020 correct
correct

01:12:32.709 --> 01:12:32.719 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:12:36.630 --> 01:12:36.640 align:start position:0%
there is a statute in existing law which
 
01:12:39.270 --> 01:12:39.280 align:start position:0%
i believe allows election officials to
 
01:12:41.350 --> 01:12:41.360 align:start position:0%
tear open the outer envelope prior to
 
01:12:42.790 --> 01:12:42.800 align:start position:0%
election day but they can't remove
 
01:12:44.149 --> 01:12:44.159 align:start position:0%
anything from it
 
01:12:45.510 --> 01:12:45.520 align:start position:0%
it's just a matter of taking letter
 
01:12:47.510 --> 01:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
openers and i don't really know how much
 
01:12:50.630 --> 01:12:50.640 align:start position:0%
time that saves anybody anyway um
 
01:12:52.470 --> 01:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
but that's the only thing i can think of
 
01:12:54.950 --> 01:12:54.960 align:start position:0%
in terms of pre-processing
 
01:12:56.950 --> 01:12:56.960 align:start position:0%
thank you uh before we go on what is
 
01:12:58.630 --> 01:12:58.640 align:start position:0%
this so i've also just for your
 
01:13:01.030 --> 01:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
information this is um a settlement
 
01:13:02.950 --> 01:13:02.960 align:start position:0%
agreement that the secretary of state's
 
01:13:05.189 --> 01:13:05.199 align:start position:0%
office entered into and it what it inc
 
01:13:06.790 --> 01:13:06.800 align:start position:0%
the reason it's tabbed is it has the
 
01:13:08.709 --> 01:13:08.719 align:start position:0%
process tab so you can see what the
 
01:13:11.830 --> 01:13:11.840 align:start position:0%
process is that they agreed to all right
 
01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:14.390 align:start position:0%
process is that they agreed to all right
um

01:13:14.390 --> 01:13:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:16.149 --> 01:13:16.159 align:start position:0%
so i'm not clear that there's any
 
01:13:18.229 --> 01:13:18.239 align:start position:0%
provision for pre-processing so we're
 
01:13:20.470 --> 01:13:20.480 align:start position:0%
going to have to
 
01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:21.510 align:start position:0%
going to have to
um

01:13:21.510 --> 01:13:21.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:24.310 --> 01:13:24.320 align:start position:0%
there it has not been unanimity between
 
01:13:25.990 --> 01:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
the house and the senate on that
 
01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:27.669 align:start position:0%
the house and the senate on that
procedure

01:13:27.669 --> 01:13:27.679 align:start position:0%
procedure
 
01:13:27.679 --> 01:13:28.830 align:start position:0%
procedure
interesting

01:13:28.830 --> 01:13:28.840 align:start position:0%
interesting
 
01:13:32.229 --> 01:13:32.239 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:13:33.990 --> 01:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
so really all we just want to make sure
 
01:13:37.030 --> 01:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
is that these um affidavits that people
 
01:13:39.830 --> 01:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
who either can't see to hand fill a
 
01:13:43.350 --> 01:13:43.360 align:start position:0%
document or can't physically hand write
 
01:13:45.830 --> 01:13:45.840 align:start position:0%
the affidavit that their
 
01:13:47.669 --> 01:13:47.679 align:start position:0%
um affidavits
 
01:13:49.990 --> 01:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
are not lost and separated from their
 
01:13:51.510 --> 01:13:51.520 align:start position:0%
actual ballots
 
01:13:51.520 --> 01:13:52.310 align:start position:0%
actual ballots
so

01:13:52.310 --> 01:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:13:54.390 --> 01:13:54.400 align:start position:0%
um that's why it really could be
 
01:13:57.270 --> 01:13:57.280 align:start position:0%
accomplished with a very simple um one
 
01:14:00.229 --> 01:14:00.239 align:start position:0%
paragraph i think amendment
 
01:14:02.790 --> 01:14:02.800 align:start position:0%
for your okay so
 
01:14:04.149 --> 01:14:04.159 align:start position:0%
which is what you passed out that's
 
01:14:05.910 --> 01:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
that's what i passed out
 
01:14:07.990 --> 01:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
but then i thought for your information
 
01:14:09.750 --> 01:14:09.760 align:start position:0%
that you might want to see the procedure
 
01:14:11.189 --> 01:14:11.199 align:start position:0%
so that's why i handed out the
 
01:14:13.189 --> 01:14:13.199 align:start position:0%
settlement agreement and tabbed the
 
01:14:15.510 --> 01:14:15.520 align:start position:0%
procedure if you felt like reading that
 
01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:16.790 align:start position:0%
procedure if you felt like reading that
because

01:14:16.790 --> 01:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:14:29.270 --> 01:14:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:31.990 --> 01:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
okay representative hayward
 
01:14:34.149 --> 01:14:34.159 align:start position:0%
well thank you madam chair and uh thank
 
01:14:35.030 --> 01:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
you for
 
01:14:37.430 --> 01:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
taking this question and without the
 
01:14:40.310 --> 01:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
benefit of your one paragraph
 
01:14:43.669 --> 01:14:43.679 align:start position:0%
what you described to me
 
01:14:46.390 --> 01:14:46.400 align:start position:0%
do you think that that is a
 
01:14:50.149 --> 01:14:50.159 align:start position:0%
requirement in the rsa or is that better
 
01:14:54.550 --> 01:14:54.560 align:start position:0%
served as a direction on by exception
 
01:14:56.950 --> 01:14:56.960 align:start position:0%
from the
 
01:15:00.630 --> 01:15:00.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:03.430 --> 01:15:03.440 align:start position:0%
well i suppose it could be in the
 
01:15:05.030 --> 01:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
included in the election procedure
 
01:15:06.550 --> 01:15:06.560 align:start position:0%
manual that the secretary of state
 
01:15:09.189 --> 01:15:09.199 align:start position:0%
publishes and distributes every year
 
01:15:10.870 --> 01:15:10.880 align:start position:0%
and certainly the secretary of state has
 
01:15:12.550 --> 01:15:12.560 align:start position:0%
published guidance to local election
 
01:15:14.790 --> 01:15:14.800 align:start position:0%
officials about how to
 
01:15:18.070 --> 01:15:18.080 align:start position:0%
address these accessible absentee votes
 
01:15:20.229 --> 01:15:20.239 align:start position:0%
that is one avenue for it but my concern
 
01:15:22.470 --> 01:15:22.480 align:start position:0%
is that if it's not codified into law
 
01:15:24.790 --> 01:15:24.800 align:start position:0%
there's no statutory requirement for
 
01:15:27.030 --> 01:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
election officials to attend training
 
01:15:29.110 --> 01:15:29.120 align:start position:0%
from the secretary of state's office so
 
01:15:30.310 --> 01:15:30.320 align:start position:0%
you know things may fall through the
 
01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:33.430 align:start position:0%
you know things may fall through the
cracks

01:15:33.430 --> 01:15:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:35.830 --> 01:15:35.840 align:start position:0%
there's also in the bill as it currently
 
01:15:35.840 --> 01:15:36.709 align:start position:0%
there's also in the bill as it currently
is

01:15:36.709 --> 01:15:36.719 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:15:38.470 --> 01:15:38.480 align:start position:0%
written there is a provision in
 
01:15:38.480 --> 01:15:39.669 align:start position:0%
written there is a provision in
paragraph

01:15:39.669 --> 01:15:39.679 align:start position:0%
paragraph
 
01:15:42.790 --> 01:15:42.800 align:start position:0%
section four that talks about attaching
 
01:15:45.350 --> 01:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
the application for an absentee ballot
 
01:15:46.630 --> 01:15:46.640 align:start position:0%
to the ballot
 
01:15:48.950 --> 01:15:48.960 align:start position:0%
so there is some guidance there is
 
01:15:50.470 --> 01:15:50.480 align:start position:0%
something in the statute about that
 
01:15:53.110 --> 01:15:53.120 align:start position:0%
application but not the affidavit
 
01:15:53.120 --> 01:15:54.229 align:start position:0%
application but not the affidavit
so

01:15:54.229 --> 01:15:54.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:15:55.430 --> 01:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
i don't know if that would create some
 
01:15:58.470 --> 01:15:58.480 align:start position:0%
confusion to only um have in a you know
 
01:16:00.070 --> 01:16:00.080 align:start position:0%
in statute that you attach the
 
01:16:02.070 --> 01:16:02.080 align:start position:0%
application and not have in statute that
 
01:16:03.510 --> 01:16:03.520 align:start position:0%
you also apply
 
01:16:05.669 --> 01:16:05.679 align:start position:0%
attach that separately printed affidavit
 
01:16:13.510 --> 01:16:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:20.229 --> 01:16:20.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:22.550 --> 01:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
thank you representative hamlet
 
01:16:24.070 --> 01:16:24.080 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:16:26.709 --> 01:16:26.719 align:start position:0%
um my my question is actually for you or
 
01:16:28.870 --> 01:16:28.880 align:start position:0%
or maybe for you
 
01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:29.830 align:start position:0%
or maybe for you
i'm

01:16:29.830 --> 01:16:29.840 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
01:16:32.870 --> 01:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
confused as to
 
01:16:35.830 --> 01:16:35.840 align:start position:0%
um we don't this doesn't have to be done
 
01:16:38.070 --> 01:16:38.080 align:start position:0%
in a pre-processing
 
01:16:40.630 --> 01:16:40.640 align:start position:0%
sect session right this can be done
 
01:16:43.030 --> 01:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
right at the
 
01:16:44.310 --> 01:16:44.320 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:16:47.510 --> 01:16:47.520 align:start position:0%
right whenever this clerk receives the
 
01:16:51.110 --> 01:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot or or whenever the you
 
01:16:52.950 --> 01:16:52.960 align:start position:0%
know they receive it at the polls they
 
01:16:52.960 --> 01:16:53.910 align:start position:0%
know they receive it at the polls they
just

01:16:53.910 --> 01:16:53.920 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:16:56.470 --> 01:16:56.480 align:start position:0%
kind of process it the way they do now
 
01:16:56.480 --> 01:16:57.590 align:start position:0%
kind of process it the way they do now
i

01:16:57.590 --> 01:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:16:59.350 --> 01:16:59.360 align:start position:0%
didn't i didn't think it required a
 
01:16:59.360 --> 01:17:00.830 align:start position:0%
didn't i didn't think it required a
pre-processing

01:17:00.830 --> 01:17:00.840 align:start position:0%
pre-processing
 
01:17:00.840 --> 01:17:02.470 align:start position:0%
pre-processing
session

01:17:02.470 --> 01:17:02.480 align:start position:0%
session
 
01:17:05.430 --> 01:17:05.440 align:start position:0%
yeah i perhaps i misspoke um and and did
 
01:17:07.030 --> 01:17:07.040 align:start position:0%
not realize that pre-processing was a
 
01:17:08.950 --> 01:17:08.960 align:start position:0%
term of art but excuse me for a minute
 
01:17:10.550 --> 01:17:10.560 align:start position:0%
are there extras of the one page
 
01:17:12.550 --> 01:17:12.560 align:start position:0%
amendment somewhere there right there
 
01:17:14.149 --> 01:17:14.159 align:start position:0%
olivia has them for you representative
 
01:17:14.159 --> 01:17:20.149 align:start position:0%
olivia has them for you representative
clearly

01:17:20.149 --> 01:17:20.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:22.390 --> 01:17:22.400 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry for that interruption
 
01:17:24.229 --> 01:17:24.239 align:start position:0%
oh that's okay perhaps i misspoke about
 
01:17:26.070 --> 01:17:26.080 align:start position:0%
the term pre-processing what i meant was
 
01:17:28.070 --> 01:17:28.080 align:start position:0%
the ability for
 
01:17:30.070 --> 01:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
local city and town clerks or election
 
01:17:32.070 --> 01:17:32.080 align:start position:0%
officials to open up the outer envelopes
 
01:17:34.310 --> 01:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
ahead of time which you know i agree is
 
01:17:35.669 --> 01:17:35.679 align:start position:0%
a great thing i think it makes it more
 
01:17:37.669 --> 01:17:37.679 align:start position:0%
efficient and i understand that the
 
01:17:39.030 --> 01:17:39.040 align:start position:0%
feedback has been overwhelmingly
 
01:17:41.270 --> 01:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
positive throughout the state i just my
 
01:17:43.990 --> 01:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
concern is that that separate affidavit
 
01:17:45.750 --> 01:17:45.760 align:start position:0%
that is printed out may get lost in the
 
01:17:48.550 --> 01:17:48.560 align:start position:0%
shuffle if there's nothing to um
 
01:17:52.149 --> 01:17:52.159 align:start position:0%
mandate that it gets attached
 
01:17:54.630 --> 01:17:54.640 align:start position:0%
just for the record thank you my town is
 
01:17:54.640 --> 01:17:55.750 align:start position:0%
just for the record thank you my town is
not

01:17:55.750 --> 01:17:55.760 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:17:57.990 --> 01:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
my will not be doing pre-processing in
 
01:17:59.750 --> 01:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
the future they didn't think the process
 
01:18:03.430 --> 01:18:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:05.669 --> 01:18:05.679 align:start position:0%
and created a lot of
 
01:18:10.229 --> 01:18:10.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:12.070 --> 01:18:12.080 align:start position:0%

01:18:15.990 --> 01:18:16.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:18.070 --> 01:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
is the printed separate printed
 
01:18:20.870 --> 01:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
affidavit put inside the inner envelope
 
01:18:23.030 --> 01:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
no it's inside the okay just sorry it's
 
01:18:26.149 --> 01:18:26.159 align:start position:0%
inside the it's in the outer envelope
 
01:18:26.159 --> 01:18:27.590 align:start position:0%
inside the it's in the outer envelope
so

01:18:27.590 --> 01:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:18:30.390 --> 01:18:30.400 align:start position:0%
the ballot would then be private right
 
01:18:31.590 --> 01:18:31.600 align:start position:0%

it looks to me like your proposed
 
01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:37.669 align:start position:0%
it looks to me like your proposed
amendment

01:18:37.669 --> 01:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:18:39.669 --> 01:18:39.679 align:start position:0%
tries to solve a problem that is already
 
01:18:41.189 --> 01:18:41.199 align:start position:0%
there in the law
 
01:18:42.390 --> 01:18:42.400 align:start position:0%
and not a problem that's being
 
01:18:44.229 --> 01:18:44.239 align:start position:0%
introduced by this
 
01:18:45.350 --> 01:18:45.360 align:start position:0%
by this
 
01:18:47.830 --> 01:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
proposed piece of legislation that the
 
01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:49.110 align:start position:0%
proposed piece of legislation that the
the

01:18:49.110 --> 01:18:49.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:18:51.590 --> 01:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
ambiguity about what to do with this
 
01:18:53.669 --> 01:18:53.679 align:start position:0%
printed affidavit
 
01:18:56.470 --> 01:18:56.480 align:start position:0%
is already present in the rsas and it's
 
01:18:58.470 --> 01:18:58.480 align:start position:0%
not it's not an ambiguity introduced by
 
01:19:00.950 --> 01:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
this piece of legislation is that fair
 
01:19:02.470 --> 01:19:02.480 align:start position:0%
does it
 
01:19:04.149 --> 01:19:04.159 align:start position:0%
i think that's a fair assessment because
 
01:19:06.390 --> 01:19:06.400 align:start position:0%
this program is so new it just debuted
 
01:19:09.669 --> 01:19:09.679 align:start position:0%
in the 2020 election um it is um
 
01:19:11.030 --> 01:19:11.040 align:start position:0%
something that the statutes haven't
 
01:19:13.669 --> 01:19:13.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:15.350 --> 01:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
the subjects have not addressed have not
 
01:19:17.110 --> 01:19:17.120 align:start position:0%

their ballot
 
01:20:17.510 --> 01:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
as part of the training
 
01:20:20.870 --> 01:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
are being informed that um
 
01:20:22.149 --> 01:20:22.159 align:start position:0%
that those
 
01:20:24.149 --> 01:20:24.159 align:start position:0%
they need to be kept with the um with
 
01:20:25.510 --> 01:20:25.520 align:start position:0%
the affidavit envelope because they
 
01:20:27.510 --> 01:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
haven't filled out the affidavit
 
01:20:30.709 --> 01:20:30.719 align:start position:0%
envelope they have printed off their um
 
01:20:33.590 --> 01:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
their affidavit uh
 
01:20:33.600 --> 01:20:35.110 align:start position:0%
their affidavit uh
currently

01:20:35.110 --> 01:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
currently
 
01:20:38.070 --> 01:20:38.080 align:start position:0%
without this law we are not opening
 
01:20:39.990 --> 01:20:40.000 align:start position:0%
the envelopes until
 
01:20:41.750 --> 01:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
until the day that you process them all
 
01:20:43.830 --> 01:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
right so so just to interrupt so i'm
 
01:20:46.870 --> 01:20:46.880 align:start position:0%
correct that this
 
01:20:49.590 --> 01:20:49.600 align:start position:0%
the underlying statute in this that
 
01:20:51.669 --> 01:20:51.679 align:start position:0%
we're amending
 
01:20:53.590 --> 01:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
is not in effect
 
01:20:56.390 --> 01:20:56.400 align:start position:0%
correct okay yes so what this
 
01:20:58.390 --> 01:20:58.400 align:start position:0%
bill is doing
 
01:21:01.910 --> 01:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
you submit your absentee ballot by mail
 
01:21:04.790 --> 01:21:04.800 align:start position:0%
this allows the clerk to open the
 
01:21:07.669 --> 01:21:07.679 align:start position:0%
outside envelope
 
01:21:08.870 --> 01:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
eyeball it
 
01:21:11.110 --> 01:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
say the person didn't sign it or they
 
01:21:14.070 --> 01:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
didn't check off their reason so they
 
01:21:17.189 --> 01:21:17.199 align:start position:0%
would notify the voter that you need to
 
01:21:20.470 --> 01:21:20.480 align:start position:0%
come in and cure your um affidavit and
 
01:21:22.629 --> 01:21:22.639 align:start position:0%
just for clarification on the purp on
 
01:21:24.390 --> 01:21:24.400 align:start position:0%
the process that's because this
 
01:21:25.990 --> 01:21:26.000 align:start position:0%
particular voter as compared to the
 
01:21:28.070 --> 01:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
voters we may have just heard yes
 
01:21:31.430 --> 01:21:31.440 align:start position:0%
has been able to actually complete the
 
01:21:34.390 --> 01:21:34.400 align:start position:0%
outer envelope that holds the balance
 
01:21:37.030 --> 01:21:37.040 align:start position:0%
when the outer envelope is opened the
 
01:21:39.669 --> 01:21:39.679 align:start position:0%
clerk is looking at that completed outer
 
01:21:41.270 --> 01:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
envelope correct
 
01:21:44.070 --> 01:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
and in these voters case when they open
 
01:21:45.590 --> 01:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
the um
 
01:21:47.830 --> 01:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
the envelope the outside envelope they
 
01:21:49.750 --> 01:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
would find this piece of paper
 
01:21:51.350 --> 01:21:51.360 align:start position:0%
inside that's just back up from a
 
01:21:52.870 --> 01:21:52.880 align:start position:0%
procedural because
 
01:21:54.550 --> 01:21:54.560 align:start position:0%
sometimes i pretend to be an engineer
 
01:21:56.629 --> 01:21:56.639 align:start position:0%
and need things in process
 
01:21:59.910 --> 01:21:59.920 align:start position:0%
so when someone is using this process
 
01:22:02.310 --> 01:22:02.320 align:start position:0%
because of disability and doing their
 
01:22:05.830 --> 01:22:05.840 align:start position:0%
electronically provided ballot
 
01:22:09.270 --> 01:22:09.280 align:start position:0%
they are not able to do the envelope
 
01:22:12.629 --> 01:22:12.639 align:start position:0%
affidavit correct so the
 
01:22:15.189 --> 01:22:15.199 align:start position:0%
without this piece of paper
 
01:22:17.430 --> 01:22:17.440 align:start position:0%
this particular ballot that's printed
 
01:22:19.830 --> 01:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
off as allowed by law as compared to the
 
01:22:22.470 --> 01:22:22.480 align:start position:0%
official ballot that gets sent to some
 
01:22:22.480 --> 01:22:23.350 align:start position:0%
official ballot that gets sent to some
people

01:22:23.350 --> 01:22:23.360 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:22:26.070 --> 01:22:26.080 align:start position:0%
gets put in that envelope the affidavit
 
01:22:28.550 --> 01:22:28.560 align:start position:0%
envelope but there is no ability to
 
01:22:31.350 --> 01:22:31.360 align:start position:0%
complete the outer envelope so this
 
01:22:33.910 --> 01:22:33.920 align:start position:0%
secretary of state's office under this
 
01:22:33.920 --> 01:22:35.270 align:start position:0%
secretary of state's office under this
agreement

01:22:35.270 --> 01:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
01:22:37.910 --> 01:22:37.920 align:start position:0%
which is not in law it's part of a case
 
01:22:37.920 --> 01:22:39.189 align:start position:0%
which is not in law it's part of a case
settlement

01:22:39.189 --> 01:22:39.199 align:start position:0%
settlement
 
01:22:43.030 --> 01:22:43.040 align:start position:0%
has a separate affidavit that is then
 
01:22:44.950 --> 01:22:44.960 align:start position:0%
able to be done
 
01:22:47.830 --> 01:22:47.840 align:start position:0%
for this particular absentee ballot
 
01:22:49.270 --> 01:22:49.280 align:start position:0%
correct so the
 
01:22:49.280 --> 01:22:50.229 align:start position:0%
correct so the
voter

01:22:50.229 --> 01:22:50.239 align:start position:0%
voter
 
01:22:53.189 --> 01:22:53.199 align:start position:0%
affidavit that's printed off done by the
 
01:22:55.750 --> 01:22:55.760 align:start position:0%
disabled voter yes or by a person
 
01:22:58.310 --> 01:22:58.320 align:start position:0%
assisting that voter uh it can be it can
 
01:23:00.470 --> 01:23:00.480 align:start position:0%
be either okay so if it's a person
 
01:23:02.950 --> 01:23:02.960 align:start position:0%
assisting the voter can't they do the
 
01:23:08.709 --> 01:23:08.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:10.790 --> 01:23:10.800 align:start position:0%
they they potentially could i'm thinking
 
01:23:13.350 --> 01:23:13.360 align:start position:0%
of one of my neighbors she has
 
01:23:15.910 --> 01:23:15.920 align:start position:0%
macro degeneration
 
01:23:17.910 --> 01:23:17.920 align:start position:0%
she can blow something up on her
 
01:23:19.430 --> 01:23:19.440 align:start position:0%
computer screen
 
01:23:19.440 --> 01:23:20.629 align:start position:0%
computer screen
and

01:23:20.629 --> 01:23:20.639 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:23:22.229 --> 01:23:22.239 align:start position:0%
complete to this
 
01:23:24.550 --> 01:23:24.560 align:start position:0%
and print it off
 
01:23:26.790 --> 01:23:26.800 align:start position:0%
submit it you know put it into the
 
01:23:30.149 --> 01:23:30.159 align:start position:0%
outside envelope and that would go to
 
01:23:30.159 --> 01:23:31.270 align:start position:0%
outside envelope and that would go to
these

01:23:31.270 --> 01:23:31.280 align:start position:0%
these
 
01:23:33.750 --> 01:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
to the town clerk when the town clerk
 
01:23:33.760 --> 01:23:34.709 align:start position:0%
to the town clerk when the town clerk

the affidavit envelope is not going to
 
01:23:39.270 --> 01:23:39.280 align:start position:0%
be completed at all but there will be
 
01:23:39.280 --> 01:23:40.310 align:start position:0%
be completed at all but there will be
this

01:23:40.310 --> 01:23:40.320 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:23:41.830 --> 01:23:41.840 align:start position:0%
special um
 
01:23:44.709 --> 01:23:44.719 align:start position:0%
affidavit in effect that takes the place
 
01:23:44.719 --> 01:23:45.510 align:start position:0%
affidavit in effect that takes the place
of

01:23:45.510 --> 01:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:23:47.430 --> 01:23:47.440 align:start position:0%
the outside part of the affidavit
 
01:23:49.990 --> 01:23:50.000 align:start position:0%
envelope their ballot is still
 
01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:51.189 align:start position:0%
envelope their ballot is still
inside

that envelope
 
01:23:55.350 --> 01:23:55.360 align:start position:0%
but that would only
 
01:23:57.350 --> 01:23:57.360 align:start position:0%
um occur
 
01:24:01.189 --> 01:24:01.199 align:start position:0%
if this if this bill is passed
 
01:24:04.709 --> 01:24:04.719 align:start position:0%
now when the clerk receives
 
01:24:08.390 --> 01:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
the absentee ballot and by mail
 
01:24:10.629 --> 01:24:10.639 align:start position:0%

01:24:13.030 --> 01:24:13.040 align:start position:0%
look into it look at the apps
 
01:24:15.350 --> 01:24:15.360 align:start position:0%
affidavit envelope to make sure that it
 
01:24:17.669 --> 01:24:17.679 align:start position:0%
was properly done
 
01:24:20.790 --> 01:24:20.800 align:start position:0%
no without this bill all of that happens
 
01:24:20.800 --> 01:24:22.390 align:start position:0%
no without this bill all of that happens
on

01:24:22.390 --> 01:24:22.400 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:24:24.629 --> 01:24:24.639 align:start position:0%
on election day
 
01:24:27.830 --> 01:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
and this bill also says that
 
01:24:29.750 --> 01:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
if you are going to the town clerk's
 
01:24:33.510 --> 01:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
office in voting in person absentee
 
01:24:34.790 --> 01:24:34.800 align:start position:0%
there's no reason for the upside
 
01:24:34.800 --> 01:24:37.590 align:start position:0%
there's no reason for the upside
envelope

01:24:37.590 --> 01:24:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:38.709 --> 01:24:38.719 align:start position:0%
i mean the
 
01:24:40.550 --> 01:24:40.560 align:start position:0%
that you complete you complete the
 
01:24:43.110 --> 01:24:43.120 align:start position:0%
affidavit envelope put your ballot
 
01:24:45.270 --> 01:24:45.280 align:start position:0%
inside there's no reason to then take
 
01:24:47.590 --> 01:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
that one and put it inside
 
01:24:49.430 --> 01:24:49.440 align:start position:0%
uh another outside envelope because
 
01:24:50.870 --> 01:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
you're not mailing it you're handing it
 
01:24:53.110 --> 01:24:53.120 align:start position:0%
to the um
 
01:24:54.870 --> 01:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
to the town clerk
 
01:24:56.629 --> 01:24:56.639 align:start position:0%
right okay and
 
01:24:58.470 --> 01:24:58.480 align:start position:0%
is a member of the committee correct in
 
01:25:00.950 --> 01:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
that the clerk's office is allowed to
 
01:25:04.470 --> 01:25:04.480 align:start position:0%
open the as it is now without this bill
 
01:25:06.870 --> 01:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
is allowed to open the outer envelope
 
01:25:09.189 --> 01:25:09.199 align:start position:0%
before election day
 
01:25:12.310 --> 01:25:12.320 align:start position:0%
they can slit them open but that's it
 
01:25:13.669 --> 01:25:13.679 align:start position:0%
they don't do
 
01:25:15.590 --> 01:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
right don't look they don't look don't
 
01:25:17.030 --> 01:25:17.040 align:start position:0%
peek okay
 
01:25:17.040 --> 01:25:18.070 align:start position:0%
peek okay
so

01:25:18.070 --> 01:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:25:19.990 --> 01:25:20.000 align:start position:0%
is the problem that is
 
01:25:23.590 --> 01:25:23.600 align:start position:0%
they are trying to address by this
 
01:25:23.600 --> 01:25:25.350 align:start position:0%
they are trying to address by this
amendment

01:25:25.350 --> 01:25:25.360 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:25:27.990 --> 01:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
in existence
 
01:25:30.590 --> 01:25:30.600 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether
 
01:25:35.910 --> 01:25:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:39.110 --> 01:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
could you restate that well currently
 
01:25:39.120 --> 01:25:40.390 align:start position:0%
could you restate that well currently
365

01:25:40.390 --> 01:25:40.400 align:start position:0%
365
 
01:25:41.990 --> 01:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
is essentially not in law the
 
01:25:43.750 --> 01:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
pre-processing is not part of the law
 
01:25:45.910 --> 01:25:45.920 align:start position:0%
correct and it appears to me and i'm
 
01:25:47.750 --> 01:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
sorry committee members for monopolizing
 
01:25:49.110 --> 01:25:49.120 align:start position:0%
this but i'm really having a hard time
 
01:25:51.430 --> 01:25:51.440 align:start position:0%
following what the issue is here
 
01:25:51.440 --> 01:25:52.390 align:start position:0%
following what the issue is here
um

01:25:52.390 --> 01:25:52.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:54.390 --> 01:25:54.400 align:start position:0%
so it appears to me
 
01:25:54.400 --> 01:25:55.830 align:start position:0%
so it appears to me
that

01:25:55.830 --> 01:25:55.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:25:59.669 --> 01:25:59.679 align:start position:0%
currently on election day
 
01:26:01.910 --> 01:26:01.920 align:start position:0%
absent the slitting open of the envelope
 
01:26:01.920 --> 01:26:03.189 align:start position:0%
absent the slitting open of the envelope
perhaps

01:26:03.189 --> 01:26:03.199 align:start position:0%
perhaps
 
01:26:03.199 --> 01:26:03.990 align:start position:0%
perhaps
the

01:26:03.990 --> 01:26:04.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:26:06.149 --> 01:26:06.159 align:start position:0%
envelope with the ballot and the
 
01:26:08.550 --> 01:26:08.560 align:start position:0%
affidavit as is currently provided in
 
01:26:11.110 --> 01:26:11.120 align:start position:0%
law are together on that day at that
 
01:26:11.120 --> 01:26:12.310 align:start position:0%
law are together on that day at that
place

01:26:12.310 --> 01:26:12.320 align:start position:0%
place
 
01:26:15.590 --> 01:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
the issue becomes if it is looked at
 
01:26:18.229 --> 01:26:18.239 align:start position:0%
before election day
 
01:26:21.189 --> 01:26:21.199 align:start position:0%
that there is concern
 
01:26:23.990 --> 01:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
the issue as i understand it
 
01:26:27.830 --> 01:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:27.840 --> 01:26:28.750 align:start position:0%
 
the

01:26:28.750 --> 01:26:28.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:26:28.760 --> 01:26:30.629 align:start position:0%
the
affidavit

01:26:30.629 --> 01:26:30.639 align:start position:0%
affidavit
 
01:26:33.350 --> 01:26:33.360 align:start position:0%
that under this settlement process is
 
01:26:34.830 --> 01:26:34.840 align:start position:0%
being printed
 
01:26:38.790 --> 01:26:38.800 align:start position:0%
separately has no place in law as it is
 
01:26:42.550 --> 01:26:42.560 align:start position:0%
currently in existence to keep it with
 
01:26:45.430 --> 01:26:45.440 align:start position:0%
the ballot envelope
 
01:26:49.990 --> 01:26:50.000 align:start position:0%
so that if you pre-process these ballots
 
01:26:52.550 --> 01:26:52.560 align:start position:0%
and there is no specific provision to
 
01:26:56.149 --> 01:26:56.159 align:start position:0%
attach this affidavit to the ballot
 
01:26:58.550 --> 01:26:58.560 align:start position:0%
envelope between the time of
 
01:27:01.110 --> 01:27:01.120 align:start position:0%
pre-processing and the election
 
01:27:03.350 --> 01:27:03.360 align:start position:0%
if something happens to that affidavit
 
01:27:05.189 --> 01:27:05.199 align:start position:0%
and it gets separated you will now have
 
01:27:07.430 --> 01:27:07.440 align:start position:0%
an absentee ballot with an envelope that
 
01:27:09.830 --> 01:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
has not been completed at all and
 
01:27:12.070 --> 01:27:12.080 align:start position:0%
therefore it will be ruled
 
01:27:14.470 --> 01:27:14.480 align:start position:0%
invalid by the moderator and not counted
 
01:27:15.990 --> 01:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
and that
 
01:27:17.830 --> 01:27:17.840 align:start position:0%
so this issue only comes up with the
 
01:27:19.830 --> 01:27:19.840 align:start position:0%
pre-processing because if you open it
 
01:27:21.430 --> 01:27:21.440 align:start position:0%
all on election day it should be there
 
01:27:22.790 --> 01:27:22.800 align:start position:0%
with the ballot it will be there with
 
01:27:24.550 --> 01:27:24.560 align:start position:0%
the ballot um
 
01:27:26.629 --> 01:27:26.639 align:start position:0%
part of this is what is the problem that
 
01:27:27.830 --> 01:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
we're trying to
 
01:27:30.550 --> 01:27:30.560 align:start position:0%
that this bill is trying to correct um
 
01:27:31.910 --> 01:27:31.920 align:start position:0%
many times we have bills that are in
 
01:27:34.550 --> 01:27:34.560 align:start position:0%
search of a problem but is what is what
 
01:27:35.590 --> 01:27:35.600 align:start position:0%
is the problem that's trying to be
 
01:27:37.510 --> 01:27:37.520 align:start position:0%
corrected here
 
01:27:39.669 --> 01:27:39.679 align:start position:0%
in this last election when we did the
 
01:27:42.629 --> 01:27:42.639 align:start position:0%
pre-processing in you know in in many
 
01:27:45.430 --> 01:27:45.440 align:start position:0%
many towns um
 
01:27:47.350 --> 01:27:47.360 align:start position:0%
they found
 
01:27:47.360 --> 01:27:48.470 align:start position:0%
they found
several

01:27:48.470 --> 01:27:48.480 align:start position:0%
several
 
01:27:50.390 --> 01:27:50.400 align:start position:0%
affidavit envelopes that were not
 
01:27:54.790 --> 01:27:54.800 align:start position:0%
properly completed um i helped with
 
01:27:57.110 --> 01:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
doing the pre-processing in my town
 
01:27:59.270 --> 01:27:59.280 align:start position:0%
and there were some people who just
 
01:28:01.189 --> 01:28:01.199 align:start position:0%
forgot to sign it
 
01:28:03.430 --> 01:28:03.440 align:start position:0%
and because this happened a few days
 
01:28:04.550 --> 01:28:04.560 align:start position:0%
beforehand when we did the
 
01:28:08.070 --> 01:28:08.080 align:start position:0%
pre-processing it was easier to contact
 
01:28:10.950 --> 01:28:10.960 align:start position:0%
those voters and say there's a problem
 
01:28:13.830 --> 01:28:13.840 align:start position:0%
with your absentee ballot with your with
 
01:28:15.430 --> 01:28:15.440 align:start position:0%
your affidavit
 
01:28:17.590 --> 01:28:17.600 align:start position:0%
you can either come and vote in person
 
01:28:20.790 --> 01:28:20.800 align:start position:0%
that day if if you are now able to
 
01:28:23.350 --> 01:28:23.360 align:start position:0%
or you can come in ahead of time and
 
01:28:25.830 --> 01:28:25.840 align:start position:0%
correct this problem
 
01:28:26.870 --> 01:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
if you
 
01:28:28.390 --> 01:28:28.400 align:start position:0%
open everything
 
01:28:28.400 --> 01:28:29.270 align:start position:0%
open everything
on

01:28:29.270 --> 01:28:29.280 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:28:31.350 --> 01:28:31.360 align:start position:0%
election day and you don't start till
 
01:28:32.950 --> 01:28:32.960 align:start position:0%
say noon
 
01:28:32.960 --> 01:28:34.229 align:start position:0%
say noon
the

01:28:34.229 --> 01:28:34.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:28:38.310 --> 01:28:38.320 align:start position:0%
ability to contact that voter and ex so
 
01:28:40.550 --> 01:28:40.560 align:start position:0%
that they could come in and cure the
 
01:28:42.550 --> 01:28:42.560 align:start position:0%
absolutely that's a different issue than
 
01:28:44.310 --> 01:28:44.320 align:start position:0%
the amendment the amendment is trying to
 
01:28:46.390 --> 01:28:46.400 align:start position:0%
address the issue that's the but that
 
01:28:48.790 --> 01:28:48.800 align:start position:0%
that's what this bill for not we don't
 
01:28:50.390 --> 01:28:50.400 align:start position:0%
have the an amendment yet but a
 
01:28:53.030 --> 01:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
potential amendment the proposal
 
01:28:55.110 --> 01:28:55.120 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:28:55.120 --> 01:28:57.030 align:start position:0%
this bill
is

01:28:57.030 --> 01:28:57.040 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:28:59.750 --> 01:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
that's that's the problem that this bill
 
01:29:03.350 --> 01:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
was trying to address was that there are
 
01:29:04.790 --> 01:29:04.800 align:start position:0%
people who
 
01:29:07.510 --> 01:29:07.520 align:start position:0%
um incorrectly fill out their affidavit
 
01:29:10.390 --> 01:29:10.400 align:start position:0%
envelopes forget to sign them etc
 
01:29:12.070 --> 01:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
and this gives the town clerk the
 
01:29:13.430 --> 01:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
ability to just look they're not
 
01:29:15.590 --> 01:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
pre-processing i mean that's the they're
 
01:29:17.990 --> 01:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
not pre-processing they're just opening
 
01:29:20.229 --> 01:29:20.239 align:start position:0%
it up looking at it does it appear you
 
01:29:22.709 --> 01:29:22.719 align:start position:0%
know is there anything obvious
 
01:29:24.870 --> 01:29:24.880 align:start position:0%
that we need to have the voter come in
 
01:29:26.870 --> 01:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
and correct so that's what the purpose
 
01:29:29.910 --> 01:29:29.920 align:start position:0%
of this bill is the amendment
 
01:29:32.070 --> 01:29:32.080 align:start position:0%
if you did that and you you opened up
 
01:29:36.310 --> 01:29:36.320 align:start position:0%
the envelope and it has this special
 
01:29:39.430 --> 01:29:39.440 align:start position:0%
um affidavit nobody is taking anything
 
01:29:41.910 --> 01:29:41.920 align:start position:0%
out of the envelope
 
01:29:41.920 --> 01:29:43.110 align:start position:0%
out of the envelope
so

01:29:43.110 --> 01:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:29:43.120 --> 01:29:43.990 align:start position:0%
so
that

01:29:43.990 --> 01:29:44.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:45.110 align:start position:0%
that
um

01:29:45.110 --> 01:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:47.510 --> 01:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
special affidavit that's been printed
 
01:29:49.590 --> 01:29:49.600 align:start position:0%
off that's not using the affidavit
 
01:29:51.910 --> 01:29:51.920 align:start position:0%
envelope would not be being removed
 
01:29:53.910 --> 01:29:53.920 align:start position:0%
nothing is being removed from the
 
01:29:56.390 --> 01:29:56.400 align:start position:0%
envelope it's the ability to look at it
 
01:29:58.790 --> 01:29:58.800 align:start position:0%
see if something needs to be cured
 
01:30:02.229 --> 01:30:02.239 align:start position:0%
and be able to contact the voter that's
 
01:30:05.030 --> 01:30:05.040 align:start position:0%
that's the logic behind um what this
 
01:30:07.189 --> 01:30:07.199 align:start position:0%
bill is trying to do all right i think i
 
01:30:08.629 --> 01:30:08.639 align:start position:0%
got it now okay
 
01:30:10.149 --> 01:30:10.159 align:start position:0%

01:32:18.480 --> 01:32:19.990 align:start position:0%

um i do have
 
01:32:27.910 --> 01:32:27.920 align:start position:0%
patricia lovejoy has signed up to speak
 
01:32:29.910 --> 01:32:29.920 align:start position:0%
to it and is familiar with the
 
01:32:32.229 --> 01:32:32.239 align:start position:0%
workings of this bill so i'm just saying
 
01:32:33.990 --> 01:32:34.000 align:start position:0%
that before you ask your question for ms
 
01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.550 align:start position:0%
that before you ask your question for ms
alfano

01:32:36.550 --> 01:32:36.560 align:start position:0%
alfano
 
01:32:38.709 --> 01:32:38.719 align:start position:0%
if i may
 
01:32:40.870 --> 01:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
my understanding after reading this bill
 
01:32:42.310 --> 01:32:42.320 align:start position:0%
and actually some comments made by
 
01:32:44.390 --> 01:32:44.400 align:start position:0%
senator gray on monday during some other
 
01:32:47.990 --> 01:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
hearings this really is a testing of the
 
01:32:50.229 --> 01:32:50.239 align:start position:0%
accuracy of the accuvope machines not
 
01:32:53.110 --> 01:32:53.120 align:start position:0%
necessarily an audit of the election
 
01:32:55.030 --> 01:32:55.040 align:start position:0%
results is that correct
 
01:32:55.040 --> 01:32:55.990 align:start position:0%
results is that correct
because

01:32:55.990 --> 01:32:56.000 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:32:58.070 --> 01:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
for example there are no audits being
 
01:33:01.270 --> 01:33:01.280 align:start position:0%
done for towns with uh paper ballots
 
01:33:05.189 --> 01:33:05.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:07.590 --> 01:33:07.600 align:start position:0%
representative i would have to defer to
 
01:33:09.590 --> 01:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state's office or have
 
01:33:11.590 --> 01:33:11.600 align:start position:0%
senator gray follow up on your question
 
01:33:11.600 --> 01:33:12.709 align:start position:0%
senator gray follow up on your question
okay

01:33:12.709 --> 01:33:12.719 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:33:14.629 --> 01:33:14.639 align:start position:0%
with that said i'll just add that uh it
 
01:33:16.390 --> 01:33:16.400 align:start position:0%
really doesn't matter to me i was just
 
01:33:18.629 --> 01:33:18.639 align:start position:0%
curious that about the use of the term
 
01:33:20.629 --> 01:33:20.639 align:start position:0%
audit i see it more as a testing of the
 
01:33:23.430 --> 01:33:23.440 align:start position:0%
machines which is which is fine
 
01:33:26.070 --> 01:33:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:29.510 --> 01:33:29.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for coming thank you
 
01:33:30.550 --> 01:33:30.560 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:33:32.310 --> 01:33:32.320 align:start position:0%
patricia lovejoy from the secretary of
 
01:33:34.070 --> 01:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
state has also signed up to speak on
 
01:33:37.750 --> 01:33:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:39.030 --> 01:33:39.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair once again
 
01:33:40.709 --> 01:33:40.719 align:start position:0%
patricia well joint secretary of state's
 
01:33:40.719 --> 01:33:43.350 align:start position:0%
patricia well joint secretary of state's
office

01:33:43.350 --> 01:33:43.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:46.149 --> 01:33:46.159 align:start position:0%
this bill is you know is attempting to
 
01:33:46.159 --> 01:33:47.510 align:start position:0%
this bill is you know is attempting to
address

01:33:47.510 --> 01:33:47.520 align:start position:0%
address
 
01:33:51.110 --> 01:33:51.120 align:start position:0%
voters concern about accuracy of
 
01:33:52.390 --> 01:33:52.400 align:start position:0%
of elections
 
01:33:54.470 --> 01:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
it is not an audit
 
01:33:55.590 --> 01:33:55.600 align:start position:0%
in that
 
01:33:58.390 --> 01:33:58.400 align:start position:0%
it is only looking at one
 
01:33:58.400 --> 01:33:59.910 align:start position:0%
it is only looking at one
machine

01:33:59.910 --> 01:33:59.920 align:start position:0%
machine
 
01:33:59.920 --> 01:34:00.629 align:start position:0%
machine
so

01:34:00.629 --> 01:34:00.639 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:34:03.030 --> 01:34:03.040 align:start position:0%
i have no idea how many machines
 
01:34:05.430 --> 01:34:05.440 align:start position:0%
manchester has but i'm assuming it's a
 
01:34:06.950 --> 01:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
lot more than one
 
01:34:10.550 --> 01:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
um this would be testing that one one
 
01:34:12.390 --> 01:34:12.400 align:start position:0%
machine that was picked from from that
 
01:34:14.709 --> 01:34:14.719 align:start position:0%
town uh we're talking about you know say
 
01:34:17.270 --> 01:34:17.280 align:start position:0%
for the like it's three
 
01:34:20.390 --> 01:34:20.400 align:start position:0%
no less than four four devices that the
 
01:34:21.910 --> 01:34:21.920 align:start position:0%
secretary of state's office would have
 
01:34:24.390 --> 01:34:24.400 align:start position:0%
picked ahead of time what towns we would
 
01:34:25.910 --> 01:34:25.920 align:start position:0%
not notify them
 
01:34:27.910 --> 01:34:27.920 align:start position:0%
need to be sneaky
 
01:34:31.510 --> 01:34:31.520 align:start position:0%
and if they have more than one machine
 
01:34:34.149 --> 01:34:34.159 align:start position:0%
um they would not be noted they would no
 
01:34:36.229 --> 01:34:36.239 align:start position:0%
any town would be notified by noon that
 
01:34:38.310 --> 01:34:38.320 align:start position:0%
their town was one of the ones selected
 
01:34:40.790 --> 01:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
but they would not be told what machine
 
01:34:44.149 --> 01:34:44.159 align:start position:0%
was selected so this is testing
 
01:34:45.430 --> 01:34:45.440 align:start position:0%
one machine
 
01:34:45.440 --> 01:34:47.430 align:start position:0%
one machine
um

01:34:47.430 --> 01:34:47.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:49.030 --> 01:34:49.040 align:start position:0%
i i'm not really sure if we need to put
 
01:34:51.189 --> 01:34:51.199 align:start position:0%
the language in here or if it's just in
 
01:34:53.270 --> 01:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
our um
 
01:34:56.229 --> 01:34:56.239 align:start position:0%
in our procedures but you'd have to make
 
01:34:58.070 --> 01:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
very sure
 
01:34:58.080 --> 01:34:59.350 align:start position:0%
very sure
that

01:34:59.350 --> 01:34:59.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:35:01.590 --> 01:35:01.600 align:start position:0%
all boxes
 
01:35:04.790 --> 01:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
are boxed by all ballots are boxed by
 
01:35:07.990 --> 01:35:08.000 align:start position:0%
what machine they came out of
 
01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:09.030 align:start position:0%
what machine they came out of
and

01:35:09.030 --> 01:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:35:11.030 --> 01:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
you have to make very sure that you
 
01:35:11.040 --> 01:35:12.709 align:start position:0%
you have to make very sure that you
don't

01:35:12.709 --> 01:35:12.719 align:start position:0%
don't
 
01:35:14.310 --> 01:35:14.320 align:start position:0%
take anything that comes from the side
 
01:35:17.510 --> 01:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
bin if a ballot can't be put in
 
01:35:20.070 --> 01:35:20.080 align:start position:0%
uh that it needs to go into a side bin
 
01:35:22.629 --> 01:35:22.639 align:start position:0%
you will have a
 
01:35:22.639 --> 01:35:24.070 align:start position:0%
you will have a
a

01:35:24.070 --> 01:35:24.080 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:35:26.149 --> 01:35:26.159 align:start position:0%
bill on friday
 
01:35:29.270 --> 01:35:29.280 align:start position:0%
that's talking about provisional ballots
 
01:35:32.950 --> 01:35:32.960 align:start position:0%
and those provisional ballots in that uh
 
01:35:34.070 --> 01:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
in that
 
01:35:34.080 --> 01:35:35.109 align:start position:0%
in that
bill

01:35:35.109 --> 01:35:35.119 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:35:37.430 --> 01:35:37.440 align:start position:0%
would be put into the side pocket to be
 
01:35:40.229 --> 01:35:40.239 align:start position:0%
hand counted at the end of the day
 
01:35:43.030 --> 01:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
so if i've got machine number five
 
01:35:44.709 --> 01:35:44.719 align:start position:0%
in manchester
 
01:35:46.229 --> 01:35:46.239 align:start position:0%
and there are
 
01:35:48.470 --> 01:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
um ballots that are going to be hand
 
01:35:48.480 --> 01:35:50.310 align:start position:0%
um ballots that are going to be hand
counted

01:35:50.310 --> 01:35:50.320 align:start position:0%
counted
 
01:35:53.189 --> 01:35:53.199 align:start position:0%
i would have to make very sure that i'm
 
01:35:55.350 --> 01:35:55.360 align:start position:0%
not including those
 
01:35:58.950 --> 01:35:58.960 align:start position:0%
when i'm boxing up the uh ballots
 
01:35:59.990 --> 01:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
that are
 
01:36:02.709 --> 01:36:02.719 align:start position:0%
related to machine number five because
 
01:36:04.229 --> 01:36:04.239 align:start position:0%
the machine
 
01:36:06.790 --> 01:36:06.800 align:start position:0%
is not going to have counted those
 
01:36:07.750 --> 01:36:07.760 align:start position:0%
so there's
 
01:36:10.629 --> 01:36:10.639 align:start position:0%
i you know i have some concerns that we
 
01:36:12.709 --> 01:36:12.719 align:start position:0%
may not you know you may not always get
 
01:36:14.950 --> 01:36:14.960 align:start position:0%
your apples to apples
 
01:36:14.960 --> 01:36:18.229 align:start position:0%
your apples to apples
um

01:36:18.229 --> 01:36:18.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:20.470 --> 01:36:20.480 align:start position:0%
and all of this
 
01:36:22.070 --> 01:36:22.080 align:start position:0%
needs to be done
 
01:36:24.870 --> 01:36:24.880 align:start position:0%
before friday morning the election ends
 
01:36:26.950 --> 01:36:26.960 align:start position:0%
on tuesday tuesday night everyone is
 
01:36:29.830 --> 01:36:29.840 align:start position:0%
doing their their counting um many times
 
01:36:31.350 --> 01:36:31.360 align:start position:0%
it's into
 
01:36:33.669 --> 01:36:33.679 align:start position:0%
uh wednesday morning before they are
 
01:36:35.910 --> 01:36:35.920 align:start position:0%
completed uh the secretary of state's
 
01:36:37.990 --> 01:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
office you know much of monday and much
 
01:36:39.350 --> 01:36:39.360 align:start position:0%
of wednesday is
 
01:36:41.910 --> 01:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
trying to get all of the um
 
01:36:44.310 --> 01:36:44.320 align:start position:0%
all the results from the various
 
01:36:44.320 --> 01:36:46.070 align:start position:0%
all the results from the various
locations

01:36:46.070 --> 01:36:46.080 align:start position:0%
locations
 
01:36:49.510 --> 01:36:49.520 align:start position:0%
these audits with the high-speed scanner
 
01:36:50.950 --> 01:36:50.960 align:start position:0%
i guess would probably have to be done
 
01:36:54.310 --> 01:36:54.320 align:start position:0%
on on thursday the ballots need to be
 
01:36:56.149 --> 01:36:56.159 align:start position:0%
brought to the secretary of state's
 
01:36:58.390 --> 01:36:58.400 align:start position:0%
office from the archives and
 
01:37:00.229 --> 01:37:00.239 align:start position:0%
using this high speed scanner which we
 
01:37:01.430 --> 01:37:01.440 align:start position:0%
need to purchase
 
01:37:04.870 --> 01:37:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:07.590 --> 01:37:07.600 align:start position:0%
my personal thoughts are what
 
01:37:09.030 --> 01:37:09.040 align:start position:0%
you know for each bill what is the
 
01:37:11.270 --> 01:37:11.280 align:start position:0%
problem we're trying to um we're trying
 
01:37:13.350 --> 01:37:13.360 align:start position:0%
to solve and in this
 
01:37:17.109 --> 01:37:17.119 align:start position:0%
bill the issue is voter confidence
 
01:37:17.119 --> 01:37:19.350 align:start position:0%
bill the issue is voter confidence
um

01:37:19.350 --> 01:37:19.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:21.430 --> 01:37:21.440 align:start position:0%
i i question whether or not it needs to
 
01:37:23.910 --> 01:37:23.920 align:start position:0%
be done by friday morning
 
01:37:27.030 --> 01:37:27.040 align:start position:0%
if what we're trying to do is
 
01:37:30.629 --> 01:37:30.639 align:start position:0%
um prove that the accuvope machines
 
01:37:32.629 --> 01:37:32.639 align:start position:0%
are correct and we're doing it on random
 
01:37:32.639 --> 01:37:33.910 align:start position:0%
are correct and we're doing it on random
sample

01:37:33.910 --> 01:37:33.920 align:start position:0%
sample
 
01:37:35.910 --> 01:37:35.920 align:start position:0%
we could potentially if we have this
 
01:37:38.149 --> 01:37:38.159 align:start position:0%
high speed scanner do a lot more than
 
01:37:39.990 --> 01:37:40.000 align:start position:0%
four but do it
 
01:37:43.510 --> 01:37:43.520 align:start position:0%
you know a little bit later than um
 
01:37:44.950 --> 01:37:44.960 align:start position:0%
than two days
 
01:37:46.629 --> 01:37:46.639 align:start position:0%
after the election
 
01:37:49.189 --> 01:37:49.199 align:start position:0%
if if what you're trying to get at is to
 
01:37:51.590 --> 01:37:51.600 align:start position:0%
give voters confidence
 
01:37:54.070 --> 01:37:54.080 align:start position:0%
that these accuvope machines correctly
 
01:37:55.510 --> 01:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
counted their
 
01:37:55.520 --> 01:37:56.550 align:start position:0%
counted their
ballots

01:37:56.550 --> 01:37:56.560 align:start position:0%
ballots
 
01:37:56.560 --> 01:37:57.830 align:start position:0%
ballots
um

01:37:57.830 --> 01:37:57.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:57.840 --> 01:37:58.790 align:start position:0%
um
it

01:37:58.790 --> 01:37:58.800 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:38:01.350 --> 01:38:01.360 align:start position:0%
i believe it could be done you know
 
01:38:04.149 --> 01:38:04.159 align:start position:0%
potentially you know the following week
 
01:38:07.430 --> 01:38:07.440 align:start position:0%
or after recounts um but obviously that
 
01:38:07.440 --> 01:38:08.149 align:start position:0%
or after recounts um but obviously that
is

01:38:08.149 --> 01:38:08.159 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:38:11.669 --> 01:38:11.679 align:start position:0%
a issue that is up for uh the house and
 
01:38:13.990 --> 01:38:14.000 align:start position:0%
the senate and the governor to decide
 
01:38:16.470 --> 01:38:16.480 align:start position:0%
whichever way you end up doing it we
 
01:38:18.790 --> 01:38:18.800 align:start position:0%
will at the secretary of state's office
 
01:38:19.830 --> 01:38:19.840 align:start position:0%
we will do
 
01:38:21.270 --> 01:38:21.280 align:start position:0%
whatever the whatever the final
 
01:38:23.750 --> 01:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
legislation is but there will be
 
01:38:25.750 --> 01:38:25.760 align:start position:0%
obviously a um
 
01:38:27.830 --> 01:38:27.840 align:start position:0%
a time crunch there of getting this done
 
01:38:30.709 --> 01:38:30.719 align:start position:0%
by friday morning
 
01:38:33.030 --> 01:38:33.040 align:start position:0%
further question representative bergeron
 
01:38:36.229 --> 01:38:36.239 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair
 
01:38:39.430 --> 01:38:39.440 align:start position:0%
as you were speaking it occurred to me
 
01:38:41.030 --> 01:38:41.040 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of polling places that
 
01:38:42.629 --> 01:38:42.639 align:start position:0%
do use two machines when there's going
 
01:38:44.790 --> 01:38:44.800 align:start position:0%
to be a high turnout yes
 
01:38:46.229 --> 01:38:46.239 align:start position:0%
particularly during the presidential
 
01:38:46.239 --> 01:38:47.990 align:start position:0%
particularly during the presidential
election

01:38:47.990 --> 01:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
election
 
01:38:49.910 --> 01:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
if you're now requiring the election
 
01:38:52.550 --> 01:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
officials to keep the ballot segregated
 
01:38:54.709 --> 01:38:54.719 align:start position:0%
from you know those used in machine x
 
01:38:57.590 --> 01:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
and those used in machine y
 
01:38:59.910 --> 01:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
aren't we introducing the possibility of
 
01:39:02.310 --> 01:39:02.320 align:start position:0%
human error that someone makes the
 
01:39:04.950 --> 01:39:04.960 align:start position:0%
mistake and puts ballots from machine x
 
01:39:07.669 --> 01:39:07.679 align:start position:0%
into cartons from for machine y
 
01:39:09.669 --> 01:39:09.679 align:start position:0%
and then the results you're going to get
 
01:39:13.189 --> 01:39:13.199 align:start position:0%
actually will not restore confidence in
 
01:39:14.870 --> 01:39:14.880 align:start position:0%
people in these machines because the
 
01:39:17.189 --> 01:39:17.199 align:start position:0%
numbers will be different will actually
 
01:39:18.950 --> 01:39:18.960 align:start position:0%
cause people get upset that the machines
 
01:39:21.189 --> 01:39:21.199 align:start position:0%
were inaccurate so to get to my question
 
01:39:24.070 --> 01:39:24.080 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it make more sense to test both
 
01:39:26.629 --> 01:39:26.639 align:start position:0%
machines in the polling place and test
 
01:39:28.629 --> 01:39:28.639 align:start position:0%
all the ballots in the polling place so
 
01:39:30.629 --> 01:39:30.639 align:start position:0%
that you get a total number that that we
 
01:39:33.189 --> 01:39:33.199 align:start position:0%
can feel confident actually reflects
 
01:39:35.189 --> 01:39:35.199 align:start position:0%
the accuracy of the machine
 
01:39:39.750 --> 01:39:39.760 align:start position:0%
that would be a a recount such as we are
 
01:39:41.830 --> 01:39:41.840 align:start position:0%
are we we already do when people request
 
01:39:44.229 --> 01:39:44.239 align:start position:0%
a um a recount
 
01:39:46.550 --> 01:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
you would also have the
 
01:39:49.590 --> 01:39:49.600 align:start position:0%
um the the possibility of
 
01:39:51.109 --> 01:39:51.119 align:start position:0%
well the ones that are hand counted all
 
01:39:52.870 --> 01:39:52.880 align:start position:0%
get pulled separately anyway so that
 
01:39:55.510 --> 01:39:55.520 align:start position:0%
probably is not as much of a of an issue
 
01:39:57.189 --> 01:39:57.199 align:start position:0%
that the hand count
 
01:40:00.790 --> 01:40:00.800 align:start position:0%
ballots from machine number five got
 
01:40:03.510 --> 01:40:03.520 align:start position:0%
put in with machine number five uh
 
01:40:03.520 --> 01:40:04.870 align:start position:0%
put in with machine number five uh
acuvo

01:40:04.870 --> 01:40:04.880 align:start position:0%
acuvo
 
01:40:04.880 --> 01:40:06.070 align:start position:0%
acuvo
ballots

01:40:06.070 --> 01:40:06.080 align:start position:0%
ballots
 
01:40:08.950 --> 01:40:08.960 align:start position:0%
but you're right if if
 
01:40:12.709 --> 01:40:12.719 align:start position:0%
and and towns are not used to having to
 
01:40:14.229 --> 01:40:14.239 align:start position:0%
keep them
 
01:40:14.239 --> 01:40:16.550 align:start position:0%
keep them
separate

01:40:16.550 --> 01:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
separate
 
01:40:18.629 --> 01:40:18.639 align:start position:0%
this would require that they do keep
 
01:40:20.229 --> 01:40:20.239 align:start position:0%
them separate and if
 
01:40:20.239 --> 01:40:21.590 align:start position:0%
them separate and if
if

01:40:21.590 --> 01:40:21.600 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:40:22.870 --> 01:40:22.880 align:start position:0%
ballots from
 
01:40:24.790 --> 01:40:24.800 align:start position:0%
you you had three quarters of a box from
 
01:40:26.629 --> 01:40:26.639 align:start position:0%
machine four and somebody puts you know
 
01:40:28.629 --> 01:40:28.639 align:start position:0%
fills it up with the ones from machine
 
01:40:31.189 --> 01:40:31.199 align:start position:0%
three and then you are trying to count
 
01:40:32.310 --> 01:40:32.320 align:start position:0%
you're right it
 
01:40:33.510 --> 01:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
it could
 
01:40:36.149 --> 01:40:36.159 align:start position:0%
uh do the opposite of what the bill is
 
01:40:39.030 --> 01:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
is trying to do which is to you know
 
01:40:42.470 --> 01:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
to restore confidence i'm uh
 
01:40:44.790 --> 01:40:44.800 align:start position:0%
to have more confidence i guess i'm
 
01:40:46.950 --> 01:40:46.960 align:start position:0%
hoping that people have not completely
 
01:40:49.189 --> 01:40:49.199 align:start position:0%
lost confidence in our active vote
 
01:40:50.550 --> 01:40:50.560 align:start position:0%
machines because they have been very
 
01:40:52.790 --> 01:40:52.800 align:start position:0%
accurate okay thank you
 
01:40:54.470 --> 01:40:54.480 align:start position:0%
further questions from committee members
 
01:40:56.149 --> 01:40:56.159 align:start position:0%
representative hayward
 
01:40:57.750 --> 01:40:57.760 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair and thank you
 
01:41:00.709 --> 01:41:00.719 align:start position:0%
for taking the question um
 
01:41:02.149 --> 01:41:02.159 align:start position:0%
and it's it's
 
01:41:04.390 --> 01:41:04.400 align:start position:0%
somewhat rhetorical i suppose
 
01:41:07.750 --> 01:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
but are you not missing an important
 
01:41:10.709 --> 01:41:10.719 align:start position:0%
piece of data on the
 
01:41:12.870 --> 01:41:12.880 align:start position:0%
by taking the ones from the side pocket
 
01:41:15.430 --> 01:41:15.440 align:start position:0%
and not counting them now certainly they
 
01:41:18.709 --> 01:41:18.719 align:start position:0%
did not run through the machine so
 
01:41:20.709 --> 01:41:20.719 align:start position:0%
as a check on
 
01:41:23.669 --> 01:41:23.679 align:start position:0%
the accuracy of the count
 
01:41:25.830 --> 01:41:25.840 align:start position:0%
they are not effective but
 
01:41:27.590 --> 01:41:27.600 align:start position:0%
because they were rejected by the
 
01:41:27.600 --> 01:41:29.510 align:start position:0%
because they were rejected by the
machine

01:41:29.510 --> 01:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
machine
 
01:41:31.510 --> 01:41:31.520 align:start position:0%
there is data
 
01:41:33.510 --> 01:41:33.520 align:start position:0%
to be
 
01:41:33.520 --> 01:41:34.950 align:start position:0%
to be
analyzed

01:41:34.950 --> 01:41:34.960 align:start position:0%
analyzed
 
01:41:38.390 --> 01:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
from those numbers as well
 
01:41:41.189 --> 01:41:41.199 align:start position:0%
the purpose of this bill
 
01:41:43.590 --> 01:41:43.600 align:start position:0%
is just to
 
01:41:46.470 --> 01:41:46.480 align:start position:0%
confirm the accuracy of the count of the
 
01:41:48.149 --> 01:41:48.159 align:start position:0%
accuvope machine
 
01:41:51.109 --> 01:41:51.119 align:start position:0%
and those hand counted what for whatever
 
01:41:53.270 --> 01:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
reason that a ballot ended up in the
 
01:41:56.390 --> 01:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
side pocket and needs to be hand counted
 
01:41:59.510 --> 01:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
would have to be excluded if the purpose
 
01:42:00.629 --> 01:42:00.639 align:start position:0%
of your
 
01:42:03.750 --> 01:42:03.760 align:start position:0%
of your action is to
 
01:42:05.830 --> 01:42:05.840 align:start position:0%
confirm the accuracy
 
01:42:07.750 --> 01:42:07.760 align:start position:0%
of the accuvolk machine if you were
 
01:42:10.310 --> 01:42:10.320 align:start position:0%
doing a full audit then yes you
 
01:42:12.870 --> 01:42:12.880 align:start position:0%
obviously need to or a recount i should
 
01:42:14.629 --> 01:42:14.639 align:start position:0%
use or not if you're doing a full
 
01:42:14.639 --> 01:42:16.390 align:start position:0%
use or not if you're doing a full
recount

01:42:16.390 --> 01:42:16.400 align:start position:0%
recount
 
01:42:19.189 --> 01:42:19.199 align:start position:0%
you would obviously need to have those
 
01:42:19.199 --> 01:42:20.550 align:start position:0%
you would obviously need to have those
um

01:42:20.550 --> 01:42:20.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:23.109 --> 01:42:23.119 align:start position:0%
those ballots included in your in your
 
01:42:24.629 --> 01:42:24.639 align:start position:0%
recount but if you're
 
01:42:26.709 --> 01:42:26.719 align:start position:0%
just trying to test
 
01:42:29.669 --> 01:42:29.679 align:start position:0%
the accuracy of the accuvolk machine
 
01:42:32.870 --> 01:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
you would not include those
 
01:42:34.950 --> 01:42:34.960 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions
 
01:42:37.750 --> 01:42:37.760 align:start position:0%
everybody said representative quailey
 
01:42:39.430 --> 01:42:39.440 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman
 
01:42:40.709 --> 01:42:40.719 align:start position:0%
thank you

thank you
uh

01:42:42.470 --> 01:42:42.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:42:44.390 --> 01:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
under part four
 
01:42:46.390 --> 01:42:46.400 align:start position:0%
state general election audits it says
 
01:42:48.070 --> 01:42:48.080 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state shall randomly
 
01:42:50.790 --> 01:42:50.800 align:start position:0%
select one to three percent of accu-vote
 
01:42:50.800 --> 01:42:52.310 align:start position:0%
select one to three percent of accu-vote
devices

01:42:52.310 --> 01:42:52.320 align:start position:0%
devices
 
01:42:54.790 --> 01:42:54.800 align:start position:0%
my question is do you know or have an
 
01:42:56.709 --> 01:42:56.719 align:start position:0%
estimate for how many accuvote devices
 
01:43:00.149 --> 01:43:00.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:02.550 --> 01:43:02.560 align:start position:0%
i do not know i can i can get that
 
01:43:05.189 --> 01:43:05.199 align:start position:0%
information for you i know we have about
 
01:43:06.629 --> 01:43:06.639 align:start position:0%
a hundred and
 
01:43:10.070 --> 01:43:10.080 align:start position:0%
twelve hundred and thirteen towns that
 
01:43:12.310 --> 01:43:12.320 align:start position:0%
do hand counts
 
01:43:12.320 --> 01:43:13.910 align:start position:0%
do hand counts
so

01:43:13.910 --> 01:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:43:15.750 --> 01:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
it's about this it's just for purposes
 
01:43:18.229 --> 01:43:18.239 align:start position:0%
of the mass assume it's the same amount
 
01:43:21.109 --> 01:43:21.119 align:start position:0%
for accupo because it's 240 something
 
01:43:23.030 --> 01:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
polling places
 
01:43:28.709 --> 01:43:28.719 align:start position:0%
minus 113 112 13 is 120 but some of
 
01:43:30.629 --> 01:43:30.639 align:start position:0%
those use two devices yeah even my town
 
01:43:32.950 --> 01:43:32.960 align:start position:0%
of stratum has two yeah
 
01:43:34.709 --> 01:43:34.719 align:start position:0%
and we're seventeen thousand yeah and
 
01:43:37.430 --> 01:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
assume there's at least 150 probably
 
01:43:39.430 --> 01:43:39.440 align:start position:0%
accu vote machines being used at least
 
01:43:41.510 --> 01:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
that's probably a good estimate but i
 
01:43:42.950 --> 01:43:42.960 align:start position:0%
can find out the exact number if you
 
01:43:44.310 --> 01:43:44.320 align:start position:0%
well i was really just looking for kind
 
01:43:45.910 --> 01:43:45.920 align:start position:0%
of an order of magnitude
 
01:43:49.350 --> 01:43:49.360 align:start position:0%
it's in the hundreds low hundreds
 
01:43:52.070 --> 01:43:52.080 align:start position:0%
basically is what you're telling me low
 
01:43:53.270 --> 01:43:53.280 align:start position:0%
to mid
 
01:43:54.950 --> 01:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:43:59.189 --> 01:43:59.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:00.790 --> 01:44:00.800 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much you're
 
01:44:02.229 --> 01:44:02.239 align:start position:0%

01:44:15.189 --> 01:44:15.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:16.550 --> 01:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman and member of
 
01:44:18.390 --> 01:44:18.400 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is alvin c i live
 
01:44:21.030 --> 01:44:21.040 align:start position:0%
in loudoun and i'm here on my own behalf
 
01:44:22.390 --> 01:44:22.400 align:start position:0%
i was at the
 
01:44:24.709 --> 01:44:24.719 align:start position:0%
senate hearing for this bill and also at
 
01:44:27.669 --> 01:44:27.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:29.350 --> 01:44:29.360 align:start position:0%
study commission
 
01:44:31.830 --> 01:44:31.840 align:start position:0%
meetings which developed this
 
01:44:31.840 --> 01:44:33.350 align:start position:0%
meetings which developed this
and

01:44:33.350 --> 01:44:33.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:44:35.590 --> 01:44:35.600 align:start position:0%
i do recall that one of the stated
 
01:44:37.590 --> 01:44:37.600 align:start position:0%
intents was to do this before the
 
01:44:41.750 --> 01:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
deadline for filing for a recount
 
01:44:43.590 --> 01:44:43.600 align:start position:0%
and that's why it was to be done before
 
01:44:46.229 --> 01:44:46.239 align:start position:0%
friday afternoon
 
01:44:47.590 --> 01:44:47.600 align:start position:0%
so that
 
01:44:49.350 --> 01:44:49.360 align:start position:0%
if any candidate
 
01:44:51.590 --> 01:44:51.600 align:start position:0%
affected by this saw this they could say
 
01:44:55.430 --> 01:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
okay yes i'm going to call for recount
 
01:44:57.189 --> 01:44:57.199 align:start position:0%
i would say that in the event of a
 
01:44:59.350 --> 01:44:59.360 align:start position:0%
mix-up of ballots that shouldn't have
 
01:45:01.830 --> 01:45:01.840 align:start position:0%
been counted or scanned and balanced
 
01:45:03.109 --> 01:45:03.119 align:start position:0%
that should have been scanned if they
 
01:45:04.390 --> 01:45:04.400 align:start position:0%
were in the wrong
 
01:45:06.629 --> 01:45:06.639 align:start position:0%
box for the wrong machine or however
 
01:45:08.390 --> 01:45:08.400 align:start position:0%
might have gotten mixed up
 
01:45:11.430 --> 01:45:11.440 align:start position:0%
that should show a fairly big error
 
01:45:12.790 --> 01:45:12.800 align:start position:0%
and if that's the case then the
 
01:45:15.750 --> 01:45:15.760 align:start position:0%
candidates may ask for a recount
 
01:45:15.760 --> 01:45:18.070 align:start position:0%
candidates may ask for a recount
or

01:45:18.070 --> 01:45:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:21.189 --> 01:45:21.199 align:start position:0%
there may be a justification for doing a
 
01:45:24.390 --> 01:45:24.400 align:start position:0%
an audit of that town
 
01:45:27.030 --> 01:45:27.040 align:start position:0%
but i'm not sure what the specific
 
01:45:30.709 --> 01:45:30.719 align:start position:0%
intent was there if that happened
 
01:45:32.550 --> 01:45:32.560 align:start position:0%
and if there's any questions i'll answer
 
01:45:32.560 --> 01:45:33.270 align:start position:0%
and if there's any questions i'll answer
them

01:45:33.270 --> 01:45:33.280 align:start position:0%

bill was amended

since its introduction the bill changed
 
02:04:05.270 --> 02:04:05.280 align:start position:0%
fairly significantly and was very
 
02:04:07.270 --> 02:04:07.280 align:start position:0%
narrowed in scope
 
02:04:08.870 --> 02:04:08.880 align:start position:0%
we did a lot of work on the bill in
 
02:04:11.030 --> 02:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
senate election law and we got it to a
 
02:04:12.629 --> 02:04:12.639 align:start position:0%
place where it passed the committee
 
02:04:17.030 --> 02:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:17.040 --> 02:04:18.149 align:start position:0%
 
currently

02:04:18.149 --> 02:04:18.159 align:start position:0%
currently
 
02:04:19.750 --> 02:04:19.760 align:start position:0%
the law allows a voter to vote or
 
02:04:22.550 --> 02:04:22.560 align:start position:0%
register to vote by absentee for reasons
 
02:04:25.270 --> 02:04:25.280 align:start position:0%
of disability
 
02:04:29.350 --> 02:04:29.360 align:start position:0%
as amended senate bill 427 expands the
 
02:04:31.750 --> 02:04:31.760 align:start position:0%
language by saying
 
02:04:34.149 --> 02:04:34.159 align:start position:0%
physical disability illness or other
 
02:04:36.870 --> 02:04:36.880 align:start position:0%
medical condition
 
02:04:39.270 --> 02:04:39.280 align:start position:0%
the change is there to provide
 
02:04:42.950 --> 02:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
clarification for voters who do not have
 
02:04:45.270 --> 02:04:45.280 align:start position:0%
what they perceive to be a physical
 
02:04:45.280 --> 02:04:46.629 align:start position:0%
what they perceive to be a physical
disability

02:04:46.629 --> 02:04:46.639 align:start position:0%
disability
 
02:04:49.189 --> 02:04:49.199 align:start position:0%
but they can't vote in person because of
 
02:04:51.030 --> 02:04:51.040 align:start position:0%
health reasons
 
02:04:54.310 --> 02:04:54.320 align:start position:0%
in 2020 during that cycle
 
02:04:56.310 --> 02:04:56.320 align:start position:0%
at the height of the pandemic the
 
02:04:58.310 --> 02:04:58.320 align:start position:0%
legislature worked in a bipartisan
 
02:04:59.990 --> 02:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
fashion to allow
 
02:05:02.310 --> 02:05:02.320 align:start position:0%
voters to vote by absentee if they were
 
02:05:05.109 --> 02:05:05.119 align:start position:0%
concerned about covid by claiming
 
02:05:05.119 --> 02:05:07.189 align:start position:0%
concerned about covid by claiming
disability

02:05:07.189 --> 02:05:07.199 align:start position:0%
disability
 
02:05:08.870 --> 02:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
during that cycle
 
02:05:11.350 --> 02:05:11.360 align:start position:0%
which was determined to be allowed
 
02:05:13.830 --> 02:05:13.840 align:start position:0%
we did however receive a significant
 
02:05:15.830 --> 02:05:15.840 align:start position:0%
amount of feedback from the disability
 
02:05:18.069 --> 02:05:18.079 align:start position:0%
rights community and constituents with
 
02:05:21.109 --> 02:05:21.119 align:start position:0%
disabilities who found the conflation of
 
02:05:24.629 --> 02:05:24.639 align:start position:0%
the potential of getting sick
 
02:05:26.709 --> 02:05:26.719 align:start position:0%
and disability
 
02:05:29.270 --> 02:05:29.280 align:start position:0%
as distinct and problematic in the
 
02:05:32.709 --> 02:05:32.719 align:start position:0%
language so senate bill 427 as amended
 
02:05:35.109 --> 02:05:35.119 align:start position:0%
acknowledges the seriousness of health
 
02:05:37.189 --> 02:05:37.199 align:start position:0%
concerns that are separate
 
02:05:39.030 --> 02:05:39.040 align:start position:0%
from what people perceive as
 
02:05:41.430 --> 02:05:41.440 align:start position:0%
disabilities and recognizes the very
 
02:05:43.830 --> 02:05:43.840 align:start position:0%
legitimate feedback that that advocacy
 
02:05:46.709 --> 02:05:46.719 align:start position:0%
community provided
 
02:05:48.390 --> 02:05:48.400 align:start position:0%
as i said this this
 
02:05:51.350 --> 02:05:51.360 align:start position:0%
legislation is very very narrow in scope
 
02:05:53.030 --> 02:05:53.040 align:start position:0%
and it's really to ensure that when
 
02:05:55.030 --> 02:05:55.040 align:start position:0%
people are registering when people are
 
02:05:57.189 --> 02:05:57.199 align:start position:0%
voting by absentee when they're signing
 
02:06:00.149 --> 02:06:00.159 align:start position:0%
a legal document acknowledging a certain
 
02:06:02.550 --> 02:06:02.560 align:start position:0%
status whether it's being out of town
 
02:06:03.669 --> 02:06:03.679 align:start position:0%
whether it's claiming to have a
 
02:06:03.679 --> 02:06:05.430 align:start position:0%
whether it's claiming to have a
disability

02:06:05.430 --> 02:06:05.440 align:start position:0%
disability
 
02:06:07.990 --> 02:06:08.000 align:start position:0%
there are people for whom
 
02:06:10.069 --> 02:06:10.079 align:start position:0%
the claim of a disability does not seem
 
02:06:13.589 --> 02:06:13.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:15.589 --> 02:06:15.599 align:start position:0%
given their particular medical status
 
02:06:17.430 --> 02:06:17.440 align:start position:0%
and this bill attempts to clarify that
 
02:06:19.830 --> 02:06:19.840 align:start position:0%
to ensure that people can
 
02:06:22.629 --> 02:06:22.639 align:start position:0%
cast their ballot by absentee with that
 
02:06:24.470 --> 02:06:24.480 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to answer any questions of
 
02:06:26.629 --> 02:06:26.639 align:start position:0%
the committee i also if i may madam
 
02:06:29.990 --> 02:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
chair i apologize um i did want to also
 
02:06:32.069 --> 02:06:32.079 align:start position:0%
make note i understand that there were
 
02:06:34.149 --> 02:06:34.159 align:start position:0%
bills sent over by this committee in the
 
02:06:36.790 --> 02:06:36.800 align:start position:0%
full house to senate election law that
 
02:06:39.589 --> 02:06:39.599 align:start position:0%
also deal with some of these statutes
 
02:06:41.830 --> 02:06:41.840 align:start position:0%
and we are looking at those in senate
 
02:06:43.589 --> 02:06:43.599 align:start position:0%
election law
 
02:06:45.669 --> 02:06:45.679 align:start position:0%
working with both you madam chair and
 
02:06:48.149 --> 02:06:48.159 align:start position:0%
senator gray i think we can resolve any
 
02:06:50.709 --> 02:06:50.719 align:start position:0%
any differences or overlaps before
 
02:06:52.709 --> 02:06:52.719 align:start position:0%
things move forward so
 
02:06:55.030 --> 02:06:55.040 align:start position:0%
with that be happy to
 
02:06:57.109 --> 02:06:57.119 align:start position:0%
answer any questions the voice of
 
02:06:59.910 --> 02:06:59.920 align:start position:0%
optimism before across before committees
 
02:07:02.149 --> 02:07:02.159 align:start position:0%
of conference is a wonderful thing
 
02:07:04.229 --> 02:07:04.239 align:start position:0%
absolutely madam chair always happy to
 
02:07:05.669 --> 02:07:05.679 align:start position:0%
work with you and any of the committee
 
02:07:07.750 --> 02:07:07.760 align:start position:0%
members to resolve as i said any
 
02:07:09.589 --> 02:07:09.599 align:start position:0%
differences so that we're we're in a
 
02:07:12.069 --> 02:07:12.079 align:start position:0%
good place and moving forward thank you
 
02:07:13.510 --> 02:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
and have fewer committees of conference
 
02:07:16.629 --> 02:07:16.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:18.550 --> 02:07:18.560 align:start position:0%
questions representative bergeron thank
 
02:07:19.910 --> 02:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
you madam chair
 
02:07:21.830 --> 02:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
senator thank you um
 
02:07:24.229 --> 02:07:24.239 align:start position:0%
just a quick question you indicated that
 
02:07:26.390 --> 02:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
the bill came out of committee on a five
 
02:07:29.189 --> 02:07:29.199 align:start position:0%
to zero vote am i correct that it also
 
02:07:30.709 --> 02:07:30.719 align:start position:0%
was approved on
 
02:07:32.950 --> 02:07:32.960 align:start position:0%
a 24-0 vote on the senate consent
 
02:07:35.270 --> 02:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
calendar that is correct representative
 
02:07:37.030 --> 02:07:37.040 align:start position:0%
bergeron it wasn't the consent calendar
 
02:07:39.109 --> 02:07:39.119 align:start position:0%
it was not removed so it was unanimously
 
02:07:41.430 --> 02:07:41.440 align:start position:0%
accepted right thank you
 
02:07:45.990 --> 02:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:47.510 --> 02:07:47.520 align:start position:0%

good morning madam chair and members of
 
02:08:17.750 --> 02:08:17.760 align:start position:0%
the house election law
 
02:08:19.750 --> 02:08:19.760 align:start position:0%
my name is linda bundy and i'm from
 
02:08:19.760 --> 02:08:21.589 align:start position:0%
my name is linda bundy and i'm from
antrim

02:08:21.589 --> 02:08:21.599 align:start position:0%
antrim
 
02:08:23.910 --> 02:08:23.920 align:start position:0%
democracy functions best when every
 
02:08:27.510 --> 02:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
voter who wants to vote is able to do so
 
02:08:31.589 --> 02:08:31.599 align:start position:0%
sb 427 increases access to the vote
 
02:08:34.550 --> 02:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
enabling greater participation
 
02:08:36.470 --> 02:08:36.480 align:start position:0%
for people who have an illness or
 
02:08:38.790 --> 02:08:38.800 align:start position:0%
medical condition and wish to vote by
 
02:08:40.470 --> 02:08:40.480 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot
 
02:08:42.709 --> 02:08:42.719 align:start position:0%
the only option for them to request the
 
02:08:42.719 --> 02:08:43.750 align:start position:0%
the only option for them to request the
ballot

02:08:43.750 --> 02:08:43.760 align:start position:0%
ballot
 
02:08:46.550 --> 02:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
is to state that they are disabled
 
02:08:48.390 --> 02:08:48.400 align:start position:0%
for those who do not consider their
 
02:08:51.430 --> 02:08:51.440 align:start position:0%
conditions to truly be a disability
 
02:08:54.310 --> 02:08:54.320 align:start position:0%
to swear or affirm on an affidavit that
 
02:08:56.950 --> 02:08:56.960 align:start position:0%
they are physically disabled gives them
 
02:08:59.669 --> 02:08:59.679 align:start position:0%
pause and may be disconcerting enough to
 
02:09:02.550 --> 02:09:02.560 align:start position:0%
prevent them from voting at all
 
02:09:06.229 --> 02:09:06.239 align:start position:0%
sb 427 provides a legitimate reason
 
02:09:07.990 --> 02:09:08.000 align:start position:0%
for voting absentee that these
 
02:09:10.390 --> 02:09:10.400 align:start position:0%
individuals can swear to with a clear
 
02:09:10.400 --> 02:09:11.990 align:start position:0%
individuals can swear to with a clear
conscience

02:09:11.990 --> 02:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
conscience
 
02:09:13.750 --> 02:09:13.760 align:start position:0%
this expands the
 
02:09:16.629 --> 02:09:16.639 align:start position:0%
access to absentee voting reducing a
 
02:09:19.270 --> 02:09:19.280 align:start position:0%
barrier that exists for some
 
02:09:21.350 --> 02:09:21.360 align:start position:0%
providing them the opportunity to
 
02:09:24.790 --> 02:09:24.800 align:start position:0%
exercise this essential civic duty
 
02:09:27.589 --> 02:09:27.599 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time thank you up
 
02:09:29.270 --> 02:09:29.280 align:start position:0%
will you take any does anybody have any
 
02:09:31.030 --> 02:09:31.040 align:start position:0%
questions i know you can do it if
 
02:09:33.189 --> 02:09:33.199 align:start position:0%
somebody does
 
02:09:34.629 --> 02:09:34.639 align:start position:0%
all right well nobody does thank you for
 
02:09:36.229 --> 02:09:36.239 align:start position:0%
coming again
 
02:09:38.629 --> 02:09:38.639 align:start position:0%
does anybody else here to this morning
 
02:09:42.709 --> 02:09:42.719 align:start position:0%
want to speak to sb427
 
02:09:43.910 --> 02:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:09:45.589 --> 02:09:45.599 align:start position:0%
patricia lovejoy from the secretary of
 
02:09:50.310 --> 02:09:50.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:52.229 --> 02:09:52.239 align:start position:0%
good morning once again patricia lovejoy
 
02:09:54.470 --> 02:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
secretary of state's office uh the
 
02:09:57.830 --> 02:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
secretary of state's only comment
 
02:09:57.840 --> 02:09:58.870 align:start position:0%
secretary of state's only comment
would

02:09:58.870 --> 02:09:58.880 align:start position:0%
would
 
02:10:01.430 --> 02:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
a recommendation that after physical
 
02:10:04.709 --> 02:10:04.719 align:start position:0%
disability put including illness or
 
02:10:07.669 --> 02:10:07.679 align:start position:0%
other medical conditions
 
02:10:10.310 --> 02:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
so you're not creating a separate
 
02:10:12.550 --> 02:10:12.560 align:start position:0%
a separate category but you're further
 
02:10:15.910 --> 02:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
defining physical disability
 
02:10:18.950 --> 02:10:18.960 align:start position:0%
i have spoken with senator susie prior
 
02:10:21.189 --> 02:10:21.199 align:start position:0%
to this and i am sure we will have some
 
02:10:23.430 --> 02:10:23.440 align:start position:0%
more conversations with the secretary of
 
02:10:26.790 --> 02:10:26.800 align:start position:0%
state between her and secretary of state
 
02:10:28.069 --> 02:10:28.079 align:start position:0%
regarding this but this is our
 
02:10:31.830 --> 02:10:31.840 align:start position:0%
recommendation is on the 14 places
 
02:10:33.109 --> 02:10:33.119 align:start position:0%
in this bill
 
02:10:34.950 --> 02:10:34.960 align:start position:0%
where you've added illness or other
 
02:10:34.960 --> 02:10:36.229 align:start position:0%
where you've added illness or other
medical

02:10:36.229 --> 02:10:36.239 align:start position:0%
medical
 
02:10:36.239 --> 02:10:37.510 align:start position:0%
medical
conditions

02:10:37.510 --> 02:10:37.520 align:start position:0%
conditions
 
02:10:40.069 --> 02:10:40.079 align:start position:0%
to include put the word in
 
02:10:43.270 --> 02:10:43.280 align:start position:0%
after disability be including illness
 
02:10:45.189 --> 02:10:45.199 align:start position:0%
or other men or
 
02:10:48.790 --> 02:10:48.800 align:start position:0%

indulgence you offered today
 
02:12:39.830 --> 02:12:39.840 align:start position:0%
uh we were just down dealing with the
 
02:12:42.709 --> 02:12:42.719 align:start position:0%
gasoline tax amendment to the bpt
 
02:12:44.069 --> 02:12:44.079 align:start position:0%
reduction which obviously had a
 
02:12:46.069 --> 02:12:46.079 align:start position:0%
significant turnout
 
02:12:46.079 --> 02:12:46.870 align:start position:0%
significant turnout
um

02:12:46.870 --> 02:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:12:49.189 --> 02:12:49.199 align:start position:0%
i'm here as uh senator bob dyer from
 
02:12:52.390 --> 02:12:52.400 align:start position:0%
district two uh and um
 
02:12:56.069 --> 02:12:56.079 align:start position:0%
a prime sponsor of senate bill 405.
 
02:12:57.750 --> 02:12:57.760 align:start position:0%
i worked with the attorney general's
 
02:13:00.709 --> 02:13:00.719 align:start position:0%
office in developing this bill uh as
 
02:13:00.719 --> 02:13:05.030 align:start position:0%
office in developing this bill uh as
well

02:13:05.030 --> 02:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:09.030 --> 02:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
took a look at the the very minimal
 
02:13:11.189 --> 02:13:11.199 align:start position:0%
possible penalties for things like
 
02:13:13.189 --> 02:13:13.199 align:start position:0%
vandalism of signs
 
02:13:13.199 --> 02:13:17.830 align:start position:0%
vandalism of signs
um

02:13:17.830 --> 02:13:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:20.069 --> 02:13:20.079 align:start position:0%
when one considers that that sign is an
 
02:13:23.669 --> 02:13:23.679 align:start position:0%
expression of the right of free speech
 
02:13:26.069 --> 02:13:26.079 align:start position:0%
and that a person who vandalizes tears
 
02:13:30.629 --> 02:13:30.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:32.550 --> 02:13:32.560 align:start position:0%
takes one of those signs is doing much
 
02:13:35.510 --> 02:13:35.520 align:start position:0%
more than a minor act of vandalism
 
02:13:37.430 --> 02:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
that's an act of free speech both by the
 
02:13:39.189 --> 02:13:39.199 align:start position:0%
person who put the sign in the ground
 
02:13:40.790 --> 02:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
and the person whose property on which
 
02:13:43.189 --> 02:13:43.199 align:start position:0%
that sign is placed
 
02:13:45.589 --> 02:13:45.599 align:start position:0%
and for those reasons i i put in
 
02:13:48.310 --> 02:13:48.320 align:start position:0%
you know the the increased penalties
 
02:13:49.830 --> 02:13:49.840 align:start position:0%
uh for that i'm happy to walk the
 
02:13:52.709 --> 02:13:52.719 align:start position:0%
committee through uh the bill
 
02:13:52.719 --> 02:13:53.430 align:start position:0%
committee through uh the bill
if

02:13:53.430 --> 02:13:53.440 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:13:57.510 --> 02:13:57.520 align:start position:0%
i'll relay the story that perhaps is
 
02:13:59.990 --> 02:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
in one sense gruesome but i i years ago
 
02:14:02.069 --> 02:14:02.079 align:start position:0%
when i was a member of the house i don't
 
02:14:03.589 --> 02:14:03.599 align:start position:0%
know who you remembered saggy tahir not
 
02:14:06.229 --> 02:14:06.239 align:start position:0%
representative here since past
 
02:14:08.229 --> 02:14:08.239 align:start position:0%
we went to kashmir
 
02:14:10.390 --> 02:14:10.400 align:start position:0%
in the course of that trip we had a
 
02:14:12.790 --> 02:14:12.800 align:start position:0%
state dinner with president musharraf in
 
02:14:14.550 --> 02:14:14.560 align:start position:0%
his cabinet
 
02:14:16.709 --> 02:14:16.719 align:start position:0%
and i sat next to the minister of
 
02:14:18.709 --> 02:14:18.719 align:start position:0%
justice and of course in the course of
 
02:14:20.390 --> 02:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
the dinner we're talking and
 
02:14:22.870 --> 02:14:22.880 align:start position:0%
and i made mention of the fact that
 
02:14:25.589 --> 02:14:25.599 align:start position:0%
the amputation of a person's left hand
 
02:14:27.750 --> 02:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
for stealing a pack of bubble gum seemed
 
02:14:30.229 --> 02:14:30.239 align:start position:0%
somewhat extreme
 
02:14:31.990 --> 02:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
and the response was
 
02:14:33.750 --> 02:14:33.760 align:start position:0%
you don't see many people walking around
 
02:14:36.149 --> 02:14:36.159 align:start position:0%
with one hand do you
 
02:14:37.910 --> 02:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
meaning that the penalty was severe
 
02:14:37.920 --> 02:14:38.870 align:start position:0%
meaning that the penalty was severe
enough

02:14:38.870 --> 02:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
enough
 
02:14:41.109 --> 02:14:41.119 align:start position:0%
that it tended to disincentivize people
 
02:14:43.109 --> 02:14:43.119 align:start position:0%
from committing the act
 
02:14:45.030 --> 02:14:45.040 align:start position:0%
and so that is the purpose behind this
 
02:14:46.390 --> 02:14:46.400 align:start position:0%
but i also believe
 
02:14:48.069 --> 02:14:48.079 align:start position:0%
not only is disincentive out of respect
 
02:14:50.390 --> 02:14:50.400 align:start position:0%
for that first amendment freedom
 
02:14:51.750 --> 02:14:51.760 align:start position:0%
that raising the penalty is something
 
02:14:53.030 --> 02:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
that someone is going to really get
 
02:14:55.750 --> 02:14:55.760 align:start position:0%
hammered with if it if if the attorney
 
02:14:57.189 --> 02:14:57.199 align:start position:0%
general's office says you know what you
 
02:14:58.870 --> 02:14:58.880 align:start position:0%
did this now you're now you're now
 
02:15:00.229 --> 02:15:00.239 align:start position:0%
you're going to pay the price because
 
02:15:02.390 --> 02:15:02.400 align:start position:0%
it's more than just wrecking a sign
 
02:15:03.990 --> 02:15:04.000 align:start position:0%
it's in fact infringing on the first
 
02:15:05.669 --> 02:15:05.679 align:start position:0%
rights the first amendment rights of
 
02:15:07.350 --> 02:15:07.360 align:start position:0%
both the sign owner and the property
 
02:15:10.149 --> 02:15:10.159 align:start position:0%
owner i'd be happy to take any questions
 
02:15:12.229 --> 02:15:12.239 align:start position:0%
questions for senator representative
 
02:15:12.239 --> 02:15:14.390 align:start position:0%
questions for senator representative
derozan

02:15:14.390 --> 02:15:14.400 align:start position:0%
derozan
 
02:15:16.069 --> 02:15:16.079 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you senator
 
02:15:17.830 --> 02:15:17.840 align:start position:0%
for taking the question
 
02:15:17.840 --> 02:15:18.550 align:start position:0%
for taking the question
so

02:15:18.550 --> 02:15:18.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:15:20.790 --> 02:15:20.800 align:start position:0%
with these kinds of instances
 
02:15:23.510 --> 02:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
fine amount aside
 
02:15:25.030 --> 02:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
if somebody's
 
02:15:28.069 --> 02:15:28.079 align:start position:0%
gets caught stealing photo political
 
02:15:28.079 --> 02:15:30.390 align:start position:0%
gets caught stealing photo political
signs

02:15:30.390 --> 02:15:30.400 align:start position:0%
signs
 
02:15:31.430 --> 02:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
it comes down to whether or not the
 
02:15:33.510 --> 02:15:33.520 align:start position:0%
attorney general's office wants to
 
02:15:33.520 --> 02:15:34.629 align:start position:0%
attorney general's office wants to
pursue

02:15:34.629 --> 02:15:34.639 align:start position:0%
pursue
 
02:15:36.870 --> 02:15:36.880 align:start position:0%
legal action or not correct can you
 
02:15:41.270 --> 02:15:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:44.149 --> 02:15:44.159 align:start position:0%
could it could the person that was um
 
02:15:47.350 --> 02:15:47.360 align:start position:0%
damaged by this be able to file a suit
 
02:15:50.069 --> 02:15:50.079 align:start position:0%
without the attorney general's office
 
02:15:52.709 --> 02:15:52.719 align:start position:0%
willing to do so
 
02:15:54.470 --> 02:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
not being an attorney i would say i
 
02:15:56.149 --> 02:15:56.159 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
02:15:58.550 --> 02:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure whether a court would
 
02:16:00.390 --> 02:16:00.400 align:start position:0%
would hold you know that this advice i
 
02:16:02.310 --> 02:16:02.320 align:start position:0%
mean i would file a suit as an amendment
 
02:16:03.589 --> 02:16:03.599 align:start position:0%
and infringe on my first amendment
 
02:16:05.189 --> 02:16:05.199 align:start position:0%
rights as the sign holder but you're
 
02:16:06.950 --> 02:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
going to go that extent for a sign that
 
02:16:08.950 --> 02:16:08.960 align:start position:0%
cost you five or ten bucks or some of
 
02:16:10.390 --> 02:16:10.400 align:start position:0%
the largest at four by eight tonight or
 
02:16:12.149 --> 02:16:12.159 align:start position:0%
a hundred bucks a piece
 
02:16:13.750 --> 02:16:13.760 align:start position:0%
so um
 
02:16:15.030 --> 02:16:15.040 align:start position:0%
i don't know that i've answered your
 
02:16:15.040 --> 02:16:15.990 align:start position:0%
i don't know that i've answered your
question

02:16:15.990 --> 02:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:16:17.589 --> 02:16:17.599 align:start position:0%
i suppose it's up to the
 
02:16:20.069 --> 02:16:20.079 align:start position:0%
to the property owner or the sign owner
 
02:16:22.390 --> 02:16:22.400 align:start position:0%
really one following one last follow-up
 
02:16:23.990 --> 02:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
the only reason they're bringing up
 
02:16:25.510 --> 02:16:25.520 align:start position:0%
i was thinking a small claims court
 
02:16:27.589 --> 02:16:27.599 align:start position:0%
where there's minimal cost to do that if
 
02:16:28.629 --> 02:16:28.639 align:start position:0%
somebody was
 
02:16:31.669 --> 02:16:31.679 align:start position:0%
damaged in some cases repeatedly
 
02:16:32.870 --> 02:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
if they would have that option is
 
02:16:34.469 --> 02:16:34.479 align:start position:0%
another way to do it without tying up
 
02:16:37.110 --> 02:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
the attorney general's office
 
02:16:39.190 --> 02:16:39.200 align:start position:0%
right but then if you look at a sign
 
02:16:43.030 --> 02:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
whose nominal value is five dollars
 
02:16:44.469 --> 02:16:44.479 align:start position:0%
all right given who's going to go to
 
02:16:46.629 --> 02:16:46.639 align:start position:0%
small claims court for that right the
 
02:16:48.709 --> 02:16:48.719 align:start position:0%
point is i think that we need to make
 
02:16:50.469 --> 02:16:50.479 align:start position:0%
a point that
 
02:16:52.469 --> 02:16:52.479 align:start position:0%
that sign is an expression of first
 
02:16:54.230 --> 02:16:54.240 align:start position:0%
amendment freedoms of the sign holder
 
02:16:55.910 --> 02:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
and the property owner
 
02:16:57.910 --> 02:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
and for that reason i think that raising
 
02:16:59.110 --> 02:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
the bar
 
02:17:01.030 --> 02:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
if you commit that offense you know
 
02:17:02.950 --> 02:17:02.960 align:start position:0%
we're watching we're the human election
 
02:17:04.790 --> 02:17:04.800 align:start position:0%
law are saying this is too all right
 
02:17:07.429 --> 02:17:07.439 align:start position:0%
you're watching a widespread
 
02:17:07.439 --> 02:17:08.870 align:start position:0%
you're watching a widespread
disrespect

02:17:08.870 --> 02:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
disrespect
 
02:17:08.880 --> 02:17:10.150 align:start position:0%
disrespect
for

02:17:10.150 --> 02:17:10.160 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:17:13.349 --> 02:17:13.359 align:start position:0%
constitutional law for law in general
 
02:17:13.359 --> 02:17:14.950 align:start position:0%
constitutional law for law in general
and

02:17:14.950 --> 02:17:14.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:17:17.429 --> 02:17:17.439 align:start position:0%
the way you can in this instance i think
 
02:17:19.669 --> 02:17:19.679 align:start position:0%
help to mitigate that is to go ahead and
 
02:17:22.070 --> 02:17:22.080 align:start position:0%
put a higher penalty on and and i would
 
02:17:24.629 --> 02:17:24.639 align:start position:0%
say here when you read the language okay
 
02:17:24.639 --> 02:17:28.309 align:start position:0%
say here when you read the language okay
uh

02:17:28.309 --> 02:17:28.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:31.030 --> 02:17:31.040 align:start position:0%
violates orders aids or bets a violation
 
02:17:32.709 --> 02:17:32.719 align:start position:0%
of the statute relative removing
 
02:17:34.709 --> 02:17:34.719 align:start position:0%
defacing destroying advertising and
 
02:17:36.070 --> 02:17:36.080 align:start position:0%
private property doesn't talk about
 
02:17:37.830 --> 02:17:37.840 align:start position:0%
public property private property and
 
02:17:39.110 --> 02:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
that's why
 
02:17:41.030 --> 02:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
shall be subject to a civil penalty of
 
02:17:43.030 --> 02:17:43.040 align:start position:0%
250 dollars
 
02:17:44.709 --> 02:17:44.719 align:start position:0%
okay it doesn't say
 
02:17:46.389 --> 02:17:46.399 align:start position:0%
it does there's no latitude all right
 
02:17:47.910 --> 02:17:47.920 align:start position:0%
and the attorney general says okay i
 
02:17:49.349 --> 02:17:49.359 align:start position:0%
bring in the case i have a picture of
 
02:17:51.349 --> 02:17:51.359 align:start position:0%
film or whatever turns around and goes
 
02:17:52.950 --> 02:17:52.960 align:start position:0%
you're guilty right there and you are
 
02:17:54.830 --> 02:17:54.840 align:start position:0%
subject to this fine
 
02:17:54.840 --> 02:17:56.389 align:start position:0%
subject to this fine
um

02:17:56.389 --> 02:17:56.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:17:57.509 --> 02:17:57.519 align:start position:0%
again again i come back to the
 
02:17:59.990 --> 02:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
constitutional ramifications of someone
 
02:18:02.389 --> 02:18:02.399 align:start position:0%
especially removing my expression of
 
02:18:05.830 --> 02:18:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:09.030 --> 02:18:09.040 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
02:18:11.190 --> 02:18:11.200 align:start position:0%
representative quailey
 
02:18:12.950 --> 02:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman
 
02:18:17.429 --> 02:18:17.439 align:start position:0%
uh my question relates to uh section one
 
02:18:18.790 --> 02:18:18.800 align:start position:0%
uh where it
 
02:18:20.549 --> 02:18:20.559 align:start position:0%
puts in a new section
 
02:18:23.270 --> 02:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
so it's uh starting on
 
02:18:26.150 --> 02:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
line four of page two
 
02:18:28.070 --> 02:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
which says no person shall use or
 
02:18:30.150 --> 02:18:30.160 align:start position:0%
threaten force violence or any tactic of
 
02:18:32.790 --> 02:18:32.800 align:start position:0%
coercion or intimidation to knowingly
 
02:18:35.110 --> 02:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
discourage interfere with etc or any
 
02:18:37.270 --> 02:18:37.280 align:start position:0%
election officer
 
02:18:39.669 --> 02:18:39.679 align:start position:0%
uh and it relates really to the the
 
02:18:41.669 --> 02:18:41.679 align:start position:0%
second paragraph roman numeral two
 
02:18:43.349 --> 02:18:43.359 align:start position:0%
whoever violates the provisions of this
 
02:18:43.359 --> 02:18:44.790 align:start position:0%
whoever violates the provisions of this
section

02:18:44.790 --> 02:18:44.800 align:start position:0%
section
 
02:18:47.750 --> 02:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
uh conspires to violate the provisions
 
02:18:50.830 --> 02:18:50.840 align:start position:0%
shall be guilty of a class b felony
 
02:18:53.669 --> 02:18:53.679 align:start position:0%
so my interest was focused by the use of
 
02:18:55.910 --> 02:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
the words discourage intimidate and
 
02:18:57.830 --> 02:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
intimidation of
 
02:19:00.230 --> 02:19:00.240 align:start position:0%
not being a legal expert
 
02:19:02.150 --> 02:19:02.160 align:start position:0%
are there actual
 
02:19:04.150 --> 02:19:04.160 align:start position:0%
formal definitions of those two words
 
02:19:05.910 --> 02:19:05.920 align:start position:0%
intimidation and discouraged under the
 
02:19:08.469 --> 02:19:08.479 align:start position:0%
law and and i ask because
 
02:19:10.870 --> 02:19:10.880 align:start position:0%
uh intimidation and discouragement seem
 
02:19:12.790 --> 02:19:12.800 align:start position:0%
to me to have a strong subjective
 
02:19:14.790 --> 02:19:14.800 align:start position:0%
component at least it's used in
 
02:19:17.030 --> 02:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
regular english
 
02:19:18.790 --> 02:19:18.800 align:start position:0%
one person may be intimidated by
 
02:19:20.629 --> 02:19:20.639 align:start position:0%
something that someone else just doesn't
 
02:19:20.639 --> 02:19:21.750 align:start position:0%
something that someone else just doesn't
even

02:19:21.750 --> 02:19:21.760 align:start position:0%
even
 
02:19:21.760 --> 02:19:23.190 align:start position:0%
even
note

02:19:23.190 --> 02:19:23.200 align:start position:0%
note
 
02:19:23.200 --> 02:19:25.270 align:start position:0%
note
so

02:19:25.270 --> 02:19:25.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:19:27.190 --> 02:19:27.200 align:start position:0%
so my direct question
 
02:19:29.270 --> 02:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
intimidation and discourage are those
 
02:19:31.910 --> 02:19:31.920 align:start position:0%
clearly defined under the current law
 
02:19:33.910 --> 02:19:33.920 align:start position:0%
i don't have the answer to that this was
 
02:19:35.910 --> 02:19:35.920 align:start position:0%
this language was specifically drafted
 
02:19:37.990 --> 02:19:38.000 align:start position:0%
by the attorney general and it came out
 
02:19:39.270 --> 02:19:39.280 align:start position:0%
of some of the results from the last
 
02:19:41.190 --> 02:19:41.200 align:start position:0%
election in fact the 2020 lectures as
 
02:19:43.190 --> 02:19:43.200 align:start position:0%
you know was very politically highly
 
02:19:45.910 --> 02:19:45.920 align:start position:0%
charged well of course of course in
 
02:19:48.630 --> 02:19:48.640 align:start position:0%
which there were instances um
 
02:19:50.630 --> 02:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
for example at the
 
02:19:52.790 --> 02:19:52.800 align:start position:0%
senate bill 43 audit that was done at
 
02:19:54.389 --> 02:19:54.399 align:start position:0%
the armory right
 
02:19:56.309 --> 02:19:56.319 align:start position:0%
i went to that numerous times obviously
 
02:19:59.190 --> 02:19:59.200 align:start position:0%
i was the impetus behind that bill
 
02:20:01.510 --> 02:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
and there were citizens there whose
 
02:20:04.070 --> 02:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
action while not physically violent
 
02:20:06.710 --> 02:20:06.720 align:start position:0%
was definitely attempted to intimidate
 
02:20:09.030 --> 02:20:09.040 align:start position:0%
and so there is subjectivity here and i
 
02:20:10.710 --> 02:20:10.720 align:start position:0%
agree with you that could be a concern
 
02:20:12.870 --> 02:20:12.880 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure how we would fix that okay
 
02:20:15.190 --> 02:20:15.200 align:start position:0%
uh i i tend to fall on the side of the
 
02:20:15.200 --> 02:20:17.429 align:start position:0%
uh i i tend to fall on the side of the
citizen

02:20:17.429 --> 02:20:17.439 align:start position:0%
citizen
 
02:20:17.439 --> 02:20:18.870 align:start position:0%
citizen
again

02:20:18.870 --> 02:20:18.880 align:start position:0%
again
 
02:20:22.230 --> 02:20:22.240 align:start position:0%
if i as a government official
 
02:20:24.150 --> 02:20:24.160 align:start position:0%
am physically threatened verbally
 
02:20:26.070 --> 02:20:26.080 align:start position:0%
threatened that's one thing
 
02:20:27.270 --> 02:20:27.280 align:start position:0%
physically threatened meaning you know
 
02:20:29.110 --> 02:20:29.120 align:start position:0%
your three-foot circle of personal space
 
02:20:30.309 --> 02:20:30.319 align:start position:0%
somebody comes within that with me
 
02:20:31.270 --> 02:20:31.280 align:start position:0%
they're gonna get they're gonna have a
 
02:20:31.280 --> 02:20:32.389 align:start position:0%
they're gonna get they're gonna have a
problem

02:20:32.389 --> 02:20:32.399 align:start position:0%
problem
 
02:20:34.070 --> 02:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
right and so
 
02:20:36.710 --> 02:20:36.720 align:start position:0%
again we may want to define that better
 
02:20:39.349 --> 02:20:39.359 align:start position:0%
because i would agree that
 
02:20:40.710 --> 02:20:40.720 align:start position:0%
i always come down on the side of the
 
02:20:43.510 --> 02:20:43.520 align:start position:0%
citizen that's just who i am
 
02:20:45.830 --> 02:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
and i think those words are subjective
 
02:20:47.670 --> 02:20:47.680 align:start position:0%
enough that they could subject someone
 
02:20:47.680 --> 02:20:48.469 align:start position:0%
enough that they could subject someone
to

02:20:48.469 --> 02:20:48.479 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:20:50.230 --> 02:20:50.240 align:start position:0%
you know a class b felonies nothing to
 
02:20:52.630 --> 02:20:52.640 align:start position:0%
laugh at which is another potential
 
02:20:53.910 --> 02:20:53.920 align:start position:0%
thing that maybe the committee wants to
 
02:20:54.950 --> 02:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
look at
 
02:20:56.950 --> 02:20:56.960 align:start position:0%
uh class b misdemeanor class a
 
02:20:59.190 --> 02:20:59.200 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor does jail time for a year i
 
02:21:00.790 --> 02:21:00.800 align:start position:0%
mean that's
 
02:21:02.950 --> 02:21:02.960 align:start position:0%
that's fairly serious right i mean think
 
02:21:04.469 --> 02:21:04.479 align:start position:0%
of employment family and those types of
 
02:21:05.429 --> 02:21:05.439 align:start position:0%
things so
 
02:21:07.110 --> 02:21:07.120 align:start position:0%
that clause i would agree with you
 
02:21:08.469 --> 02:21:08.479 align:start position:0%
perhaps the committee might want to look
 
02:21:10.950 --> 02:21:10.960 align:start position:0%
at that and revise that in the penalty
 
02:21:12.870 --> 02:21:12.880 align:start position:0%
okay thank you and madam chairman i have
 
02:21:15.349 --> 02:21:15.359 align:start position:0%
a follow-up question
 
02:21:17.910 --> 02:21:17.920 align:start position:0%
thank you this is on a
 
02:21:20.630 --> 02:21:20.640 align:start position:0%
section four
 
02:21:20.640 --> 02:21:21.429 align:start position:0%
section four
uh

02:21:21.429 --> 02:21:21.439 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:21:24.830 --> 02:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
page oh this is page two
 
02:21:29.030 --> 02:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
uh line 11 except as otherwise provided
 
02:21:30.710 --> 02:21:30.720 align:start position:0%
in this section whoever violates or
 
02:21:32.550 --> 02:21:32.560 align:start position:0%
orders aids etc
 
02:21:35.950 --> 02:21:35.960 align:start position:0%
any provision of this section or rsa 6
 
02:21:35.960 --> 02:21:37.670 align:start position:0%
any provision of this section or rsa 6
6414

02:21:37.670 --> 02:21:37.680 align:start position:0%
6414
 
02:21:40.150 --> 02:21:40.160 align:start position:0%
subject to civil penalty
 
02:21:42.150 --> 02:21:42.160 align:start position:0%
for each piece of political advertising
 
02:21:42.160 --> 02:21:44.550 align:start position:0%
for each piece of political advertising
removed

02:21:44.550 --> 02:21:44.560 align:start position:0%
removed
 
02:21:47.429 --> 02:21:47.439 align:start position:0%
as a little puzzled a little puzzled by
 
02:21:49.429 --> 02:21:49.439 align:start position:0%
this because
 
02:21:54.389 --> 02:21:54.399 align:start position:0%
section 664 14 refers to
 
02:21:56.469 --> 02:21:56.479 align:start position:0%
as i understood it basically the fact
 
02:21:58.389 --> 02:21:58.399 align:start position:0%
you have to identify who put the
 
02:22:00.070 --> 02:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
advertising out
 
02:22:02.070 --> 02:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
and there's no reference in
 
02:22:05.190 --> 02:22:05.200 align:start position:0%
664 14 that i could find in my looking
 
02:22:06.630 --> 02:22:06.640 align:start position:0%
at it
 
02:22:09.429 --> 02:22:09.439 align:start position:0%
regarding removal of signs so i'm a
 
02:22:09.439 --> 02:22:10.950 align:start position:0%
