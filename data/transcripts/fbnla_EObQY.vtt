the way we're going to do this is we're
 
00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:40.720 align:start position:0%
going to take up
 
00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:42.880 align:start position:0%
one bill at a time first in a work
 
00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:43.749 align:start position:0%
one bill at a time first in a work
session

00:07:43.749 --> 00:07:43.759 align:start position:0%
session
 
00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:45.360 align:start position:0%
where we'll discuss what we ought to do
 
00:07:47.189 --> 00:07:47.199 align:start position:0%
with it and then we'll move
 
00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:49.360 align:start position:0%
directly into an executive session for
 
00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:50.560 align:start position:0%
that bill
 
00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:54.160 align:start position:0%
we will um make make a motion and vote
 
00:07:55.749 --> 00:07:55.759 align:start position:0%
and then we'll move on to a work session
 
00:07:57.350 --> 00:07:57.360 align:start position:0%
for the second
 
00:08:00.309 --> 00:08:00.319 align:start position:0%
and eventually the third bill there are
 
00:08:01.749 --> 00:08:01.759 align:start position:0%
only two appropriate
 
00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:05.120 align:start position:0%
motions to be made on interim study
 
00:08:08.629 --> 00:08:08.639 align:start position:0%
one is to recommend that future
 
00:08:10.469 --> 00:08:10.479 align:start position:0%
legislation be filed
 
00:08:13.189 --> 00:08:13.199 align:start position:0%
and the other is that future legislation
 
00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:15.440 align:start position:0%
should not be filed
 
00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
so um any other motion is out of order
 
00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:22.000 align:start position:0%
and um we can
 
00:08:24.869 --> 00:08:24.879 align:start position:0%
proceed uh the first bill we're going to
 
00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:26.560 align:start position:0%
take up in work session
 
00:08:29.909 --> 00:08:29.919 align:start position:0%
is hb 738 that
 
00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:32.080 align:start position:0%
bill is relative to protection from an
 
00:08:33.829 --> 00:08:33.839 align:start position:0%
abusive work environment
 
00:08:38.469 --> 00:08:38.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:40.389 --> 00:08:40.399 align:start position:0%
i can provide a little bit of background
 
00:08:40.399 --> 00:08:41.509 align:start position:0%
i can provide a little bit of background
um

00:08:41.509 --> 00:08:41.519 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:43.509 --> 00:08:43.519 align:start position:0%
the the reason we sent this to uh
 
00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
interim study
 
00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:48.560 align:start position:0%
was because um uh there is an
 
00:08:50.389 --> 00:08:50.399 align:start position:0%
interest on the part of the department
 
00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:52.160 align:start position:0%
of administrative services
 
00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
in developing a program that would
 
00:08:57.430 --> 00:08:57.440 align:start position:0%
address civility in the workplace
 
00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:00.640 align:start position:0%
um for
 
00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
over a year they've been working on that
 
00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:03.750 align:start position:0%
over a year they've been working on that
program

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:03.760 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:06.240 align:start position:0%
um they intended to have trainings for
 
00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:06.949 align:start position:0%
um they intended to have trainings for
um

00:09:06.949 --> 00:09:06.959 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:10.240 align:start position:0%
managers and employees rolled out during
 
00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:11.120 align:start position:0%
the winter
 
00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
but just when they're getting ready to
 
00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:14.800 align:start position:0%
do that
 
00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
they're almost ready to do that and the
 
00:09:17.829 --> 00:09:17.839 align:start position:0%
pandemic struck
 
00:09:20.949 --> 00:09:20.959 align:start position:0%
so things are delayed i
 
00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
understand that they have gone back to
 
00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:24.080 align:start position:0%
work on
 
00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:27.360 align:start position:0%

program that they will be pushing out
 
00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:06.880 align:start position:0%
uh as the chairman stated we did have
 
00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:07.750 align:start position:0%
uh as the chairman stated we did have
conversations

00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:07.760 align:start position:0%
conversations
 
00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
with uh the administration office over
 
00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:14.240 align:start position:0%
um over the uh summertime
 
00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
and as recently as in the past couple of
 
00:10:17.509 --> 00:10:17.519 align:start position:0%
weeks and they have
 
00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:20.640 align:start position:0%
um commissioner arlinghaus's group has
 
00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
has committed to
 
00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:24.320 align:start position:0%
completing this program and they would
 
00:10:25.829 --> 00:10:25.839 align:start position:0%
like to get it pushed out
 
00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:28.480 align:start position:0%
as soon as possible they've done a good
 
00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:30.720 align:start position:0%
job and we'll also have access to go in
 
00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:32.000 align:start position:0%
and look at that program to make
 
00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
sure that it covered all the bases that
 
00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:35.360 align:start position:0%
we talked with them about
 
00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:37.600 align:start position:0%
um it was an honor to work with all of
 
00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
these folks and you mr chairman in order
 
00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
to get this
 
00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:43.600 align:start position:0%
done as we both agreed uh
 
00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
early on that this should have been
 
00:10:47.269 --> 00:10:47.279 align:start position:0%
policy and not legislation
 
00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
and uh and i believe that um that the
 
00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:51.040 align:start position:0%
commissioners group
 
00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:52.160 align:start position:0%
commissioner arlington house and his
 
00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:54.320 align:start position:0%
group have worked very hard to to make
 
00:10:55.509 --> 00:10:55.519 align:start position:0%
this possible so
 
00:10:57.430 --> 00:10:57.440 align:start position:0%
a handclap to them because they did a
 
00:10:58.870 --> 00:10:58.880 align:start position:0%
great job
 
00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
and they continued on even when uh there
 
00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:03.680 align:start position:0%
were no people in the offices they can
 
00:11:06.069 --> 00:11:06.079 align:start position:0%
continue to work on the program so um
 
00:11:07.269 --> 00:11:07.279 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm
 
00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:15.090 align:start position:0%
very optimistic about the outcome of it
 
00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:17.750 align:start position:0%
very optimistic about the outcome of it

commissioner
 
00:12:24.389 --> 00:12:24.399 align:start position:0%
and i believe that they are very earnest
 
00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
in putting this forward as a policy
 
00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:32.320 align:start position:0%
to all state employees and i'm pretty
 
00:12:33.829 --> 00:12:33.839 align:start position:0%
satisfied with
 
00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:36.720 align:start position:0%
package that they've developed and i
 
00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
leave it to the committee as to
 
00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:41.200 align:start position:0%
whether or not anything needs to go
 
00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:44.480 align:start position:0%
forward continue to monitor this
 
00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:05.360 align:start position:0%
a couple of the comments that i would
 
00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:07.680 align:start position:0%
make is that both the representative
 
00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:10.720 align:start position:0%
nunes and myself have asked to be kept
 
00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
in the loop and
 
00:13:14.629 --> 00:13:14.639 align:start position:0%
given access to the training uh once it
 
00:13:15.269 --> 00:13:15.279 align:start position:0%
is uh
 
00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:17.200 align:start position:0%
online so that we can experience it
 
00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:18.320 align:start position:0%
along with the
 
00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:22.480 align:start position:0%
managers and the state employees um
 
00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:32.829 --> 00:13:32.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:32.839 --> 00:13:35.430 align:start position:0%

committee
 
00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:39.440 align:start position:0%
this is manny um i guess how
 
00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
um i should raise my hand but i just
 
00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:43.040 align:start position:0%
wanted to say that i think just
 
00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
continuing the monitoring of this
 
00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:48.800 align:start position:0%
um is a great idea and i'm
 
00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
happy to see that the department of
 
00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:52.800 align:start position:0%

00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:54.320 align:start position:0%
seriously and it's implementing
 
00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:58.470 align:start position:0%
seriously and it's implementing
trainings

00:13:58.470 --> 00:13:58.480 align:start position:0%

subcommittee work session do we need a
 
00:14:37.829 --> 00:14:37.839 align:start position:0%
motion and uh our second or should we
 
00:14:37.839 --> 00:14:38.550 align:start position:0%
motion and uh our second or should we
just

00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:38.560 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:14:42.629 --> 00:14:42.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:44.560 align:start position:0%
i believe that uh we don't need a motion
 
00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
in a work session the motion comes in
 
00:14:47.509 --> 00:14:47.519 align:start position:0%
the executive session
 
00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:50.000 align:start position:0%
i'm correct on that right christina um
 
00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
i've seen it done both ways
 
00:14:53.189 --> 00:14:53.199 align:start position:0%
um i know the paperwork looks like it's
 
00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
a subcommittee um
 
00:14:57.030 --> 00:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
so not necessary as i said i've seen it
 
00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:57.509 align:start position:0%
so not necessary as i said i've seen it
both

00:14:57.509 --> 00:14:57.519 align:start position:0%
both
 
00:14:59.030 --> 00:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
both ways so we could move right into
 
00:15:01.269 --> 00:15:01.279 align:start position:0%
executive session i see no need to vote
 
00:15:01.279 --> 00:15:01.910 align:start position:0%
executive session i see no need to vote
twice

00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
twice
 
00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
um mr chairman as as chairman i believe
 
00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:05.920 align:start position:0%
you have the right to
 
00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:08.000 align:start position:0%
call the meeting into executive session
 
00:15:09.509 --> 00:15:09.519 align:start position:0%
yep that's what i'm about to do we're
 
00:15:11.189 --> 00:15:11.199 align:start position:0%
moving into executive session
 
00:15:15.269 --> 00:15:15.279 align:start position:0%
on hb 738
 
00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:16.880 align:start position:0%
and at this point it would be
 
00:15:18.949 --> 00:15:18.959 align:start position:0%
appropriate for to have a motion
 
00:15:20.949 --> 00:15:20.959 align:start position:0%
um representative nunes do you have a
 
00:15:20.959 --> 00:15:22.470 align:start position:0%

00:15:28.389 --> 00:15:28.399 align:start position:0%
is needed on this item
 
00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:32.240 align:start position:0%

00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:34.960 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
again some background on this one
 
00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:39.520 align:start position:0%
representative thomas was a prime
 
00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:40.310 align:start position:0%
representative thomas was a prime
sponsor

00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
sponsor
 
00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:43.600 align:start position:0%
um and testified before the committee as
 
00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:46.720 align:start position:0%
and she also participated in a
 
00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:49.120 align:start position:0%
subcommittee work session that we um had
 
00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:50.240 align:start position:0%
on this bill
 
00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:53.840 align:start position:0%
and um the
 
00:17:57.190 --> 00:17:57.200 align:start position:0%
there was not i
 
00:17:59.270 --> 00:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
don't want to put thoughts into people's
 
00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:00.720 align:start position:0%
minds but uh
 
00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
the um there were some issues raised
 
00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:05.200 align:start position:0%
both during the hearing and during the
 
00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:06.310 align:start position:0%
both during the hearing and during the
subcommittee

00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:06.320 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
um as to how the bill would be
 
00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:09.510 align:start position:0%
um as to how the bill would be
implemented

00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:09.520 align:start position:0%
implemented
 
00:18:11.909 --> 00:18:11.919 align:start position:0%
um i don't recall any testimony
 
00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:13.280 align:start position:0%
testimony saying that
 
00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:16.000 align:start position:0%
people who are using therapeutic
 
00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.270 align:start position:0%
people who are using therapeutic
cannabis

00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
cannabis
 
00:18:19.909 --> 00:18:19.919 align:start position:0%
ought to be fired just for that there
 
00:18:20.789 --> 00:18:20.799 align:start position:0%
were concerns
 
00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:28.240 align:start position:0%
perhaps impaired um
 
00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
working certain types of jobs and uh
 
00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:34.160 align:start position:0%
in the end i believe the conclusion was
 
00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:36.320 align:start position:0%
that there were no easy solutions
 
00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
those concerns and
 
00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:46.240 align:start position:0%
i also called representative thomas uh
 
00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
in recent days
 
00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:50.720 align:start position:0%
and uh she remains interested in working
 
00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:51.190 align:start position:0%
and uh she remains interested in working
on

00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:51.200 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:54.240 align:start position:0%
um uh on the issue and
 
00:18:58.150 --> 00:18:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:00.400 align:start position:0%
file legislation going forward possibly
 
00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:02.480 align:start position:0%
a study committee
 
00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
but with that i would open it up to
 
00:19:12.549 --> 00:19:12.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
mr chairman yes representative flanagan
 
00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
um i happen to concur i think uh
 
00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:22.480 align:start position:0%
by legalizing uh medical marijuana uh
 
00:19:23.909 --> 00:19:23.919 align:start position:0%
there has probably got to be some
 
00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:26.160 align:start position:0%
guidelines and i'm so glad that you
 
00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
mentioned that it would be a study
 
00:19:28.549 --> 00:19:28.559 align:start position:0%
committee because
 
00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:30.960 align:start position:0%
this bill right now i believe we've had
 
00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
parameters in it that need to do further
 
00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
research so
 
00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:36.400 align:start position:0%
i'd be i'd be supportive of a bill
 
00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:38.320 align:start position:0%
dealing with a study committee of
 
00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:41.600 align:start position:0%
specifics and as you said is you know
 
00:19:43.510 --> 00:19:43.520 align:start position:0%
you you can't have positions
 
00:19:46.549 --> 00:19:46.559 align:start position:0%
or occupations in which the public is is
 
00:19:48.150 --> 00:19:48.160 align:start position:0%
being served and someone being on
 
00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:49.600 align:start position:0%
cannabis so
 
00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:51.360 align:start position:0%
i'd be supportive somewhat supportive of
 
00:19:53.669 --> 00:19:53.679 align:start position:0%
where you are right now
 
00:19:56.950 --> 00:19:56.960 align:start position:0%
representative i would uh
 
00:19:58.630 --> 00:19:58.640 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i would i tend to
 
00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:00.400 align:start position:0%
agree with representative flanagan
 
00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:03.200 align:start position:0%
i was uh in this uh work committee the
 
00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
study group that uh when they came in to
 
00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
talk to us about
 
00:20:09.669 --> 00:20:09.679 align:start position:0%
about the thing and the issue that i had
 
00:20:10.789 --> 00:20:10.799 align:start position:0%
through this was
 
00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
that i did not like mandating to private
 
00:20:14.549 --> 00:20:14.559 align:start position:0%
industry what they should do and what
 
00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:15.760 align:start position:0%
they shouldn't do
 
00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:18.080 align:start position:0%
uh but as we move towards legalization
 
00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:19.600 align:start position:0%
in the state and at some point it will
 
00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:20.070 align:start position:0%
in the state and at some point it will
happen

00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
happen
 
00:20:22.870 --> 00:20:22.880 align:start position:0%
i believe that uh when that does happen
 
00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:24.720 align:start position:0%
that uh things will need to be in place
 
00:20:25.669 --> 00:20:25.679 align:start position:0%
in order to
 
00:20:28.789 --> 00:20:28.799 align:start position:0%
uh suffice this need so i am
 
00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
in agreement with mr flanagan
 
00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:38.710 align:start position:0%
in agreement with mr flanagan
[Music]

00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:41.669 --> 00:20:41.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um will workmen's
 
00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:43.760 align:start position:0%

at the table for the study committee
 
00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:49.360 align:start position:0%
um i don't know that i'm in a position
 
00:20:50.149 --> 00:20:50.159 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:52.240 align:start position:0%
to say but i would agree that it's a
 
00:20:54.149 --> 00:20:54.159 align:start position:0%
good idea
 
00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
seeing no other hands are we ready to
 
00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:11.909 --> 00:21:11.919 align:start position:0%
let's do that um
 
00:21:15.430 --> 00:21:15.440 align:start position:0%
the um uh
 
00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
moving into executive session on house
 
00:21:19.590 --> 00:21:19.600 align:start position:0%
bill 1386
 
00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:26.240 align:start position:0%
i usually have this prepared ahead of
 
00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
time representative flanagan would you
 
00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
like to make a motion
 
00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:31.840 align:start position:0%
i do but i'm somewhat hesitant mr
 
00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
chairman because
 
00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:37.760 align:start position:0%
um can we recommend further legislation
 
00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:40.640 align:start position:0%
but qualify it by saying in the form of
 
00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:41.520 align:start position:0%

00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:02.640 align:start position:0%
when this came to the committee in a
 
00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:03.909 align:start position:0%
when this came to the committee in a
hearing

00:24:03.909 --> 00:24:03.919 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:07.840 align:start position:0%
earlier this year most of the testimony
 
00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
came from
 
00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:13.360 align:start position:0%
the policy
 
00:24:16.710 --> 00:24:16.720 align:start position:0%
advisor i think to the governor
 
00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:21.520 align:start position:0%
mr elms i believe is his name and um
 
00:24:26.070 --> 00:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
we were told that um while this bill had
 
00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:29.200 align:start position:0%
supported a valuable concept um
 
00:24:31.669 --> 00:24:31.679 align:start position:0%
uh he wasn't really ready ready for
 
00:24:32.549 --> 00:24:32.559 align:start position:0%
prime time
 
00:24:34.149 --> 00:24:34.159 align:start position:0%
we were also told that there would be
 
00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:36.480 align:start position:0%
another bill coming from the senate that
 
00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:37.360 align:start position:0%
would be better
 
00:24:40.390 --> 00:24:40.400 align:start position:0%
um structured um
 
00:24:43.350 --> 00:24:43.360 align:start position:0%
obviously that never happened for us um
 
00:24:47.909 --> 00:24:47.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:53.029 --> 00:24:53.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:57.430 --> 00:24:57.440 align:start position:0%
qualified as not ready to go forward
 
00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:00.480 align:start position:0%
so with that um and there was also some
 
00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:01.669 align:start position:0%
so with that um and there was also some
testimony

00:25:01.669 --> 00:25:01.679 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
00:25:05.190 --> 00:25:05.200 align:start position:0%
against the bill from um the um
 
00:25:08.390 --> 00:25:08.400 align:start position:0%
uh i believe it was the uh
 
00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
june uh colleges because there is
 
00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:14.240 align:start position:0%
the the bill was shifting money from
 
00:25:15.510 --> 00:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
scholarships to
 
00:25:19.029 --> 00:25:19.039 align:start position:0%
um debt relief
 
00:25:21.669 --> 00:25:21.679 align:start position:0%
so um at any rate that's well that's
 
00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:22.640 align:start position:0%
what we've got
 
00:25:24.549 --> 00:25:24.559 align:start position:0%
um and nothing has happened in the
 
00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
interim um
 
00:25:28.950 --> 00:25:28.960 align:start position:0%
so um with that i'd open it up to uh
 
00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:32.789 align:start position:0%
so um with that i'd open it up to uh
discussion

00:25:32.789 --> 00:25:32.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:35.120 align:start position:0%
mr chairman yes mr representative
 
00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:35.830 align:start position:0%
mr chairman yes mr representative
flanagan

00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:35.840 align:start position:0%
flanagan
 
00:25:37.909 --> 00:25:37.919 align:start position:0%
uh in light of the fact of the the
 
00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
brevity of the testimony
 
00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:41.840 align:start position:0%
and obviously the governor's office to
 
00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
resubmit it
 
00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
um i think we should just let this one
 
00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:48.470 align:start position:0%
um i think we should just let this one
go

00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:52.390 --> 00:25:52.400 align:start position:0%
i tend to agree with the ranking member
 
00:26:01.990 --> 00:26:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:04.390 --> 00:26:04.400 align:start position:0%
seeing no hands seeing no one jumping up
 
00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
and down on the screen
 
00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:08.400 align:start position:0%
um i would appear that we were ready to
 
00:26:10.549 --> 00:26:10.559 align:start position:0%
move to executive session on this
 
00:26:14.549 --> 00:26:14.559 align:start position:0%
any objection seeing none
 
00:26:16.549 --> 00:26:16.559 align:start position:0%
we are going into executive session on
 
00:26:20.390 --> 00:26:20.400 align:start position:0%
house bill 1576.
 
00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:22.840 align:start position:0%

for him to get that to you
 
00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
actually um i would say for any of that
 
00:28:03.830 --> 00:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
uh paperwork you can go ahead and send
 
00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:04.389 align:start position:0%
uh paperwork you can go ahead and send
that

00:28:04.389 --> 00:28:04.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
probably to the clerk i'm sure he's he
 
00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:07.440 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
expecting it um but anyone that made a
 
00:28:11.190 --> 00:28:11.200 align:start position:0%
motion we do
 
00:28:14.070 --> 00:28:14.080 align:start position:0%
need a the recommendation report um you
 
00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
can send those to me and then we'll get
 
00:28:19.190 --> 00:28:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:22.630 --> 00:28:22.640 align:start position:0%
okay so um our our motions came from
 
00:28:25.909 --> 00:28:25.919 align:start position:0%
i believe representative flanagan on two
 
00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:29.120 align:start position:0%
and representative nunes on one um
 
00:28:32.549 --> 00:28:32.559 align:start position:0%
and i would uh in fact i would suggest
 
00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
that you send those to me first because
 
00:28:35.669 --> 00:28:35.679 align:start position:0%
i'm supposed to review them
 
00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:38.000 align:start position:0%
so if you could email those reports to
 
00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:39.360 align:start position:0%
me today
 
00:28:41.350 --> 00:28:41.360 align:start position:0%
um i would recommend that you keep them
 
00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
quite brief
 
00:28:47.510 --> 00:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
um and um no need to put a lot of uh
 
00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:50.640 align:start position:0%
sweat and tears into it um but uh
 
00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
mr mr chairman yes yes sir um
 
00:28:57.110 --> 00:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
so basically send you an email and copy
 
00:29:00.549 --> 00:29:00.559 align:start position:0%
uh christina in is that what you want
 
00:29:01.909 --> 00:29:01.919 align:start position:0%
you either you can just send it directly
 
00:29:03.510 --> 00:29:03.520 align:start position:0%
to me and i'll forward it to her or you
 
00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
can copy her on it as well that that
 
00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:07.360 align:start position:0%
that would be fine and then all i would
 
00:29:08.950 --> 00:29:08.960 align:start position:0%
have to do is just give it a thumbs up
 
00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:10.640 align:start position:0%
to go ahead and
 
00:29:13.909 --> 00:29:13.919 align:start position:0%
move down the pipeline and just so i
 
00:29:14.389 --> 00:29:14.399 align:start position:0%
know what
 
00:29:17.269 --> 00:29:17.279 align:start position:0%
the the bill numbers were um that we're
 
00:29:18.389 --> 00:29:18.399 align:start position:0%
dealing with today
 
00:29:19.830 --> 00:29:19.840 align:start position:0%
the bill numbers that you are dealing
 
00:29:23.110 --> 00:29:23.120 align:start position:0%
with are hp 1386
 
00:29:26.389 --> 00:29:26.399 align:start position:0%
and hb 1576
 
00:29:31.149 --> 00:29:31.159 align:start position:0%
hang on i need to find a crayon 13 what
 
00:29:31.159 --> 00:29:36.149 align:start position:0%
hang on i need to find a crayon 13 what
1386.

00:29:36.149 --> 00:29:36.159 align:start position:0%

00:30:07.029 --> 00:30:07.039 align:start position:0%
thank you um and

00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:10.630 align:start position:0%
as we're drawing to a close here i i
would

00:30:10.630 --> 00:30:10.640 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:30:11.909 --> 00:30:11.919 align:start position:0%
i guess i'd like to say that over the
 
00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:13.760 align:start position:0%
last two years um
 
00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:15.760 align:start position:0%
i've thoroughly enjoyed working with the
 
00:30:17.669 --> 00:30:17.679 align:start position:0%
entire committee um
 
00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:19.520 align:start position:0%
and uh i've enjoyed developing the
 
00:30:20.950 --> 00:30:20.960 align:start position:0%
relationships with uh
 
00:30:24.389 --> 00:30:24.399 align:start position:0%
with all of you and um
 
00:30:27.590 --> 00:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
as the as we bring it to a close um
 
00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
i'd like to save i consider you all
 
00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:30.710 align:start position:0%
i'd like to save i consider you all
friends

00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:30.720 align:start position:0%
friends
 
00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
um and we don't agree on everything
 
00:30:37.430 --> 00:30:37.440 align:start position:0%
we've certainly had uh some um
 
00:30:40.470 --> 00:30:40.480 align:start position:0%
energetic discussions but uh um i think
 
00:30:41.029 --> 00:30:41.039 align:start position:0%
we've been
 
00:30:43.590 --> 00:30:43.600 align:start position:0%
generally uh respectful of each other
 
00:30:44.789 --> 00:30:44.799 align:start position:0%
i've tried to
 
00:30:47.830 --> 00:30:47.840 align:start position:0%
lead the committee with respect and uh
 
00:30:50.870 --> 00:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
you know thank you all for um
 
00:30:53.029 --> 00:30:53.039 align:start position:0%
for making a fun committee to work with
 
00:30:54.389 --> 00:30:54.399 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:30:56.710 --> 00:30:56.720 align:start position:0%
with that uh i guess we have a moment
 
00:30:58.549 --> 00:30:58.559 align:start position:0%
for other comments if anybody wants to
 
00:30:59.430 --> 00:30:59.440 align:start position:0%

00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:02.840 align:start position:0%

00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:03.990 align:start position:0%
well thank you mr chairman this is andy
renzullo

00:31:03.990 --> 00:31:04.000 align:start position:0%

00:31:07.269 --> 00:31:07.279 align:start position:0%
and i must commend you
 
00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
on your as your in your final final
 
00:31:11.669 --> 00:31:11.679 align:start position:0%
committee uh
 
00:31:14.070 --> 00:31:14.080 align:start position:0%
meeting you've you got the republicans
 
00:31:19.669 --> 00:31:19.679 align:start position:0%
to do all the work
 
00:31:22.710 --> 00:31:22.720 align:start position:0%
and mr chairman it's been an honor and
 
00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:24.240 align:start position:0%
privilege to work with all of you
 
00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
uh as you know i'm not coming back um we
 
00:31:28.789 --> 00:31:28.799 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily agree on everything
 
00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:30.720 align:start position:0%
but we're certainly not disagreeable and
 
00:31:32.549 --> 00:31:32.559 align:start position:0%
i agree with you 100 percent
 
00:31:35.669 --> 00:31:35.679 align:start position:0%
the professionalism um of people is
 
00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:37.360 align:start position:0%
is a quality that i think is uni
 
00:31:39.350 --> 00:31:39.360 align:start position:0%
somewhat unique to this this committee
 
00:31:40.389 --> 00:31:40.399 align:start position:0%
it's uh
 
00:31:43.350 --> 00:31:43.360 align:start position:0%
it can be difficult at times and trying
 
00:31:45.509 --> 00:31:45.519 align:start position:0%
but we deal with some unique positions
 
00:31:46.870 --> 00:31:46.880 align:start position:0%
and policy issues
 
00:31:48.389 --> 00:31:48.399 align:start position:0%
that i think no other committee deal
 
00:31:50.230 --> 00:31:50.240 align:start position:0%
with whether it's unemployment workers
 
00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:51.430 align:start position:0%
with whether it's unemployment workers
compensation

00:31:51.430 --> 00:31:51.440 align:start position:0%
compensation
 
00:31:53.509 --> 00:31:53.519 align:start position:0%
it can be somewhat complicated to the
 
00:31:55.029 --> 00:31:55.039 align:start position:0%
average member so
 
00:32:04.470 --> 00:32:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:06.080 align:start position:0%
i'd like to concur with the chairman i
 
00:32:07.750 --> 00:32:07.760 align:start position:0%
i'm very appreciative of all the work
 
00:32:08.870 --> 00:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
