1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.000
As chair of Division III of the House Finance Committee, I find that due to the state of emergency declared, and we're recording, aren't we, Mr.

2
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Ripple?

3
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Yeah, okay.

4
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:24.500
Declared by the governor's emergency order number 12 pursuant to Executive Order 2020-04 is extended.

5
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.500
This public body is authorized to meet electronically.

6
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:41.000
Please note that there is no physical location to observe and listen contemporaneously to this meeting, which was authorized pursuant to the governor's emergency order.

7
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:56.000
However, in accordance with the emergency order, I'm confirming that we are providing public access to the meeting by telephone with additional access possibilities by video or other electronic means.

8
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.500
We're using Zoom video webinar for this remote meeting.

9
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:27.000
All members of the committee and staff of state agency with agenda items have the ability to communicate contemporaneously during this meeting through this platform and the public has access to contemporaneously watch and or listen to the meeting on Zoom or phone following the direction and links provided in the House calendar.

10
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:37.500
And it's been in the House calendar since calendar eight through the present, and they're all online at the GenCourt website.

11
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:47.500
And in that calendar, we've previously given notice to the public of the necessary information for accessing the meeting telephonically.

12
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.000
Instructions are also in the House calendar.

13
00:01:51.000 --> 00:02:05.500
However, if anyone's having troubles accessing this by phone or by video, they should email the LBA underscore fiscal, F-I-S-C-A-L at leg, L-E-G dot state dot N-H dot U-S.

14
00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:17.500
And if nobody, if we have a problem with the public accessing it and know about it, we'll go ahead and adjourn and reschedule.

15
00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:26.000
If we take any votes today, and I don't anticipate any, it'll be by roll call vote.

16
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:38.000
So let's go ahead and, representative or if you have your hand up now, did you mean to say something now before roll call?

17
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:49.500
Yes, I want to let you know the representative Weiler told us yesterday that he would be here today, but he'll be late.

18
00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:55.000
Okay, so representative Bean, would you go ahead and take attendance?

19
00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:09.500
And then as we go through, if each member would just state their physical location and the presence of others, we need that for the right to know requirements.

20
00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.500
Good morning, all.

21
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.500
Representative Walner.

22
00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.500
Representative Walner is here.

23
00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:23.000
I'm in Concord in my home and my husband is in the house with me.

24
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Representative Nordgren.

25
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Representative Nordgren, I'm here in my dining room, which appears to be my office now, and I'm alone.

26
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Representative Rogers.

27
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Representative Rogers, I'm in Concord, New Hampshire in my apartment with my dog, Romeo.

28
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Representative Orr.

29
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.500
Present, home alone in my home office.

30
00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.500
Representative Edwards.

31
00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.000
I'm in Auburn in my home office.

32
00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:01.500
And I have family and dogs in the house, but they're unlikely to come in.

33
00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.500
Representative Weiler is obviously missing temporarily.

34
00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.500
I'm Representative Bean.

35
00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:11.500
I'm in Guilford in my house, and I'm here alone.

36
00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.500
All right.

37
00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.000
Well, thank you for that.

38
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Good morning, everyone.

39
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.500
We have, I think it's an interesting day today.

40
00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:38.500
One, because the topic of the morning in public health is interesting in light of COVID and what they've done and listening to what they need to be able to do post-pandemic.

41
00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:49.000
And then this afternoon, we've got some invited guests coming in to talk to us about particular aspects of the budget.

42
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:57.000
So I think it's going to be an interesting day, but it's really up to Ms.

43
00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.500
Tilley to make it interesting.

44
00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:05.000
So we'll go ahead and get started when you're ready, Mr.

45
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
Ripple.

46
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Yep, I think everybody's in and you're good to go.

47
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
Good morning, everyone.

48
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:26.000
So I'm going to turn it right over to Lisa, the Director of Public Health, and Patricia Talley, the Deputy Director of Public Health.

49
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:47.000
I just wanted to mention that as far as today goes, when we get to the accounting units, it is about 90 pages of the budget book that we'll be going through today, just to give you a little preview to that.

50
00:05:47.000 --> 00:06:02.500
The way that public health is doing their presentation is they are going through their entire division and then we will hit all of the accounting units for the entire division.

51
00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:11.000
So just to make you aware, I won't be jumping in in the middle of this presentation.

52
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:36.000
Okay, so because the accounting units, the details are going to take so much time, I would just ask the presenters, we were provided this slide deck in advance, assume we've looked at it, assume that we generally know what's been going on with COVID, and try to keep moving.

53
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
All right, thank you.

54
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
Thank you.

55
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
I'm terribly sorry.

56
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
You're good to go.

57
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
Good to go.

58
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Go ahead, Lisa.

59
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
Great.

60
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:56.500
So good morning, Representative Edwards and members of the Division III Finance Committee.

61
00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:04.000
We're very pleased today to present the work of the Division of Public Health Services.

62
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:13.000
The presenters for this particular presentation are myself as the Director of the Division of Public Health Services.

63
00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:33.000
The presenters for this particular presentation are myself as the director of the division, Patricia Tilly, or Tricia, is the deputy director of the division, and Shelley Swanson, Rochelle Swanson, is the finance director, and will be doing this presentation.

64
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:46.500
And Representative Edwards, I'm not sure that you have seen this particular presentation before, and we apologize for not getting it to you sooner than this moment.

65
00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:49.000
So please bear with us.

66
00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
So Mr.

67
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
Ripple sent me something last night.

68
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
Sent us also.

69
00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
Oh, okay.

70
00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
Oh, all right.

71
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
Okay, that's great.

72
00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.500
We're a 24 by seven committee at this point.

73
00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:09.000
So 20, yes, I know.

74
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.500
I, yes, I'm sure that you are.

75
00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:29.500
So today's agenda is going to include outcomes in the overview of the work that we do, key program services and our population served, delivery system accomplishments, key challenges, financial summary, and prioritized needs.

76
00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:34.000
So we're going to move to the next slide.

77
00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.500
So we are a relatively large bureau.

78
00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:42.000
We have nine bureaus, 249 staff, 70 accounting units.

79
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.500
So we have many programs.

80
00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:52.000
Much of our work is done out of contracts with agencies out in the community.

81
00:08:52.000 --> 00:09:00.000
So we have 344 current contracts, which is quite a few and keeps us very busy.

82
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:10.500
55% of our budget are federal funds, such as CDC or the Health Resources Services Administration, just to name a few.

83
00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:19.500
Only 16% of our total budget are general funds, so we do not rely heavily on general funds.

84
00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:30.500
And 29% of our budget is other funds, such as fees, pharmaceutical rebates, the New Hampshire Vaccine Association, to name a few.

85
00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:32.500
Although we focus on...

86
00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:34.500
Yes, Representative?

87
00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:39.500
So as questions come up, I'll be raising my hand.

88
00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:41.500
Okay.

89
00:09:41.500 --> 00:10:05.500
So a question I just started asking in the last 24 hours when it comes to staff is, it'd be great if you could break that down for how many personnel are authorized as permanent and as unclassified, the total 249 at the end of the FY21 budget.

90
00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:20.500
And then if you could just summarize for us what you're expected that to be at the end of FY23 and the total of how many you have on hand.

91
00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:25.500
So one question we keep asking is about vacancy rates.

92
00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:38.500
And so out of that 249, if you've got a 20% vacancy rate or whatever it is, we'd like to see what your current headcount is.

93
00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:51.000
You don't need to do all that right now, but I'm just letting you know that that's the kind of stuff we're also looking at.

94
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:57.000
We'll certainly get that information to you, Representative Edwards, if not today.

95
00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:06.500
We'll follow up with any questions that are asked today that we're unable to answer momentarily at the moment.

96
00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:12.500
You weren't prepared for that question, so I'm not expecting it today.

97
00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:14.500
Okay, thank you.

98
00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:38.000
So as I had started to mention that although we focus on the most vulnerable populations in the state of New Hampshire, which are varied relative to the subject matter, we do serve and cover all 1.36 million of the citizens within the state of New Hampshire.

99
00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.500
So if you could go to the next slide.

100
00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:54.000
So, you know, like you, we have had a very challenging year and our focus really has been on the response for COVID.

101
00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:02.500
We have put the majority of the work that we're doing on COVID on the public dashboard.

102
00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:06.000
So you can see that every day.

103
00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:12.500
And I feel confident that all of you have been on the dashboard.

104
00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:18.500
And you will see recently we added a vaccine dashboard as well.

105
00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:29.000
So you can monitor how much vaccine has been administered and is available to us in the state of New Hampshire.

106
00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:41.000
But this particular slide is showing the number of cases that we had yesterday and the average cases per day and the seven-day average.

107
00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:50.500
But we have investigated and monitored close contacts for over 76,000 individuals, almost 77,000 individuals, which is pretty unbelievable.

108
00:12:50.500 --> 00:13:01.500
We had a low case count of about seven in July, but we had well over 1,000 cases in December and January.

109
00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:09.000
And of course, over the last number of weeks, our case counts have dramatically reduced.

110
00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:26.000
We are on the road to recovery, including not only have our case counts reduced, but also hospitalizations and death, which I know that you agree is, you know, makes us very, very happy.

111
00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:31.500
And we believe that we are on the road to recovery.

112
00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:35.500
So the next slide is our vaccination slide.

113
00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:41.500
And it shows you how many doses, which is the vaccination slide.

114
00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:49.500
And it shows you how many doses, which is the gray line, that have been administered.

115
00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:55.500
And then the blue line is how many individuals are fully vaccinated.

116
00:13:55.500 --> 00:14:05.500
So you can see that each day, of course, this will improve as we're vaccinating thousands of individuals per day.

117
00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:07.500
What's your projection, Ms.

118
00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:25.000
Morris, on when the vaccination program will have hit sort of a maturity point to where we're not tracking population stats on a daily basis and this just fades back into the routine vaccination efforts?

119
00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:34.500
Well, of course, it will depend upon the volume of vaccine that we're able to get into the state.

120
00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:40.500
It is increasing every single week, so we're very pleased about that.

121
00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:50.500
And as more companies come on board with emergency youth authorization, we'll be able to vaccinate more and more individuals.

122
00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:58.000
So a lot of the timeline is dependent upon volume of vaccine into the state.

123
00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:08.000
But we suspect that vaccinations will go on through the summer, as we haven't even hit the full population yet.

124
00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:13.000
We've only vaccinated about 20% of the population to date.

125
00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:37.000
So it's going to be quite a number of months down the road before we're able to go back to some sense of normalcy, which is, I think, what you're talking about, Representative Edwards, around all the healthcare provider communities doing booster shots, possibly on a yearly basis.

126
00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:50.500
As the volume of vaccination comes into the state, we will be distributing that to the healthcare provider community so they will have a more active role.

127
00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:57.500
They already have an active role, but even a more active role in vaccination.

128
00:15:57.500 --> 00:16:02.500
So we'll be able to move that timeline even closer.

129
00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:05.500
Does that make sure your question?

130
00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:14.500
So from the budget perspective, you'll be doing this for a few months into the next budget cycle?

131
00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:19.000
Yeah, I mean, response will still be going on.

132
00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:27.500
So you know, we'll still have fixed sites probably, you know, through into the summer for sure.

133
00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:36.000
But we're going to be investigating cases and contact tracing for quite a long time to come.

134
00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:45.500
There are still many people who are unvaccinated and COVID is not going away anytime in the near future.

135
00:16:45.500 --> 00:17:04.000
So response will still continue, but we'll be able to sort of shrink the level of response as we, you know, between what we have now and maybe what we have, you know, coming into the fall.

136
00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000
Thank you.

137
00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000
You're welcome.

138
00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
Next slide.

139
00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:16.500
So this is, again, our last slide relative to that is COVID specific.

140
00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:26.000
And this just really demonstrates through our public health lab, the challenges that we've had to this last year.

141
00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:36.000
So this shows, you know, from 2012 through 2020, the volume of testing that our public health lab has done.

142
00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:41.000
And obviously, in 2020, you can see that huge jump.

143
00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.500
The yellow is all COVID.

144
00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:59.000
So, you know, we thank our public health lab for the great work that they have done in addition to our case investigation and everybody else who has been in response.

145
00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000
So thank you.

146
00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.000
So we'll move on to the next slide.

147
00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:21.000
So in the past few years, we've had a considerable number of successes at the Division of Public Health Services in working with our partners in the community and across the department.

148
00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:36.000
And I would like to just talk about several of them, but this is just a small list of the many outcomes, positive outcomes that we've had within the division.

149
00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:43.000
So as you can see here, almost 76,000 persons with COVID have been investigated.

150
00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:48.500
We have already discussed this, the number of vaccine doses administered.

151
00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:59.500
We also have a vibrant universal childhood vaccine program here with administering 500,000 doses of vaccine to our children across New Hampshire.

152
00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:06.500
We have 1,630 individuals have used our New Hampshire tobacco quit line in 2020.

153
00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:17.000
21% of the callers are very concerned about the impact of tobacco use and COVID as it is a respiratory disease.

154
00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:28.000
Universal blood lead testing, which was newly required for all one and two year olds in New Hampshire over the past year.

155
00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:42.500
The percent of two year olds screened increased from 55% in 2015 to 70% in 2019, thanks to the legislation and we expect that number to continue to increase.

156
00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:52.500
Only 5.6% of families in Healthy Family America, which is a home visiting program, had preterm births last fiscal year.

157
00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:57.000
The national average for the similar program is 11.2%.

158
00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:01.500
And the last state average in 2018 was 8.3%.

159
00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:04.500
We're very proud of that outcome.

160
00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:22.000
Rural health and primary care, those programs supported the claims denial analytics project, credited with saving eight of the 13 critical access hospitals over $29 million over denied claims, which is quite a large savings.

161
00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:33.000
Does that mean that $29 million had been denied and then after this effort, the $29 million was released to the hospitals?

162
00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000
That's correct.

163
00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:46.500
So we'll get a little bit now into the Division of Public Health and exactly what we do and why we do it.

164
00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:52.500
So our mission is really to protect the health of all people.

165
00:20:52.500 --> 00:21:01.500
And under each of these categories, you'll see some of the programs that reflect that particular mission statement.

166
00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:04.500
We target evidence-based strategies that, yes.

167
00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:07.500
I'm sorry, I'm a little slow.

168
00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:11.000
I'm still thinking about the previous slide.

169
00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000
Oh, okay.

170
00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000
We'll go back.

171
00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:30.000
That $29 million, maybe when we're talking about the accounting lines, if somebody could point out to me how much we invested of general funds to recoup that $29 million.

172
00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:42.500
dollars you know obviously if we're paying 50 million to get 29 million that's not very smart but if it's only a1 million, it's brilliant.

173
00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:46.500
So I'd just like to know that later.

174
00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:48.500
Correct.

175
00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:53.000
So just we can actually answer that question now.

176
00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:57.500
Trisha, Deputy Director Trisha Tilly oversees this particular program.

177
00:21:57.500 --> 00:22:01.000
And Tricia, is this program federally funded?

178
00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000
Yes.

179
00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:07.000
So thank you, Representative Edwards, for the question.

180
00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:11.000
This is actually use of our federal funds.

181
00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.500
We have a small hospital improvement program.

182
00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:24.000
It's called SHIP, not to be confused with our state health improvement plan, but a small hospital improvement plan.

183
00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.000
It's federal dollars.

184
00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:38.500
They come to us and we organize with the feedback from the hospitals, in particular the critical access hospitals, what they need for technical assistance.

185
00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:44.000
And we arrange to bring in the experts to help them.

186
00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:53.000
And this has been an incredibly successful program where they had been seeing this pattern of denied claims.

187
00:22:53.000 --> 00:23:03.500
And so we brought in the folks to say, you know, how can they get those claims fixed on their end?

188
00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:11.500
So I don't have the exact number of this particular program, but it's relatively short changed.

189
00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:21.000
The SHIP program, I could be wrong on this, but certainly is around $150,000 a year of federal dollars.

190
00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.000
So no general funds in this particular project.

191
00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.000
Sounds brilliant, thank you.

192
00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.500
Back to that slide, Trisha.

193
00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:31.500
Next slide.

194
00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:35.500
Trisha is controlling the, as you can see.

195
00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:37.500
Thank you.

196
00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:43.000
So we target evidence-based strategies that we know will improve health.

197
00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:47.500
We ensure equitable access to high-value, effective, preventative-focused healthcare.

198
00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:56.500
We collect and analyze data about health status and community needs and assets and ultimately improve health outcomes.

199
00:23:56.500 --> 00:23:58.500
That's the goal.

200
00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:00.500
Next slide, please.

201
00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:03.000
This is the organizational chart.

202
00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.500
It's very hard to see.

203
00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:07.500
I apologize for that.

204
00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:13.500
Of the Division of Public Health Services, so we have seven bureaus.

205
00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:16.000
So I am the director.

206
00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.500
We have the deputy director.

207
00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:21.000
You know Deputy Director Tilly.

208
00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.000
We have our state epidemiologist, Dr.

209
00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000
Chan.

210
00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:33.000
We have an administrative assistant, and then we have the seven bureaus listed below.

211
00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:39.500
And we're going to go through each bureau to give you additional information.

212
00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:41.500
Yes, Representative Ezra.

213
00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:58.000
So which of these bureaus, if any of them, are the ones where we have an arrangement with UNH to subsidize about half of their salary so that they also work with us?

214
00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.000
Thank you.

215
00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:07.000
So this provides more detail relative to the bureaus that I just mentioned previously.

216
00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:16.500
So the Bureau of Population Health and Community Services promotes health across the age continuum and reduces health inequities.

217
00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:31.500
And some of the programs here are chronic disease programs and screenings, maternal and child health, prenatal child health, newborn screening, injury prevention, teen pregnancy, nutrition, tobacco prevention, and cessation.

218
00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:42.500
Then we have the Bureau of Infectious Disease Control, which many of you have become very familiar with during the COVID pandemic.

219
00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:47.000
This Bureau identifies, investigates, monitors, and prevents infectious disease.

220
00:25:47.000 --> 00:26:03.000
So they do disease surveillance and investigation, vaccine distribution, public health emergency preparedness and response, provider training and education, financial assistance to people infected with HIV and tuberculosis, and vaccines for children.

221
00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:10.500
We have the Bureau of Public Health Laboratories, which provides clinical and environmental laboratory testing.

222
00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:26.000
So the public health lab provides environmental health and biomonitoring testing, as well as drinking water testing, food emergency response, microbiology and virology, and sentinel laboratory training, education and quality improvement.

223
00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:34.500
And this is around referencing external lab training on biological agents and continuity of operations in biosafety.

224
00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:38.000
So we'll go to the next slide.

225
00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:44.000
The next bureau is the Bureau of Public Health Statistics and Informatics.

226
00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:54.000
This particular Bureau collects, analyzes, and distributes New Hampshire health statistics and oversight and maintenance of systems that move data.

227
00:26:54.000 --> 00:27:07.000
Some of the areas that they work on is the health data portal, which is called Wisdom, data statistics and management, and informatics and electronic reporting.

228
00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:16.500
The Bureau of Health Protection, which assures public safety from environmental public health risks, provides environmental health and biomonitoring.

229
00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:28.000
Oh, I think that this is an error, and this is through the public health lab, but they do do environmental health work.

230
00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:32.000
They do, oh, there was an error here.

231
00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.000
So this, I apologize for the error here.

232
00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.500
This is around the public health lab.

233
00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:44.500
They do the lead prevention work, so healthy homes work.

234
00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:49.500
They do food, the food protection and radiological health work.

235
00:27:49.500 --> 00:28:20.000
The Bureau of Public Health Systems Policy and Performance, which is public health systems quality improvement and performance management, is working in the state health assessment and the state health improvement plan, which Representative Edwards is quite familiar with, Operational planning quality improvement, oversees the 13 public health regional networks and provides healthcare workforce recruitment, retention and development and therapeutic cannabis.

236
00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.000
Next slide, please.

237
00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:35.500
Then we have the Bureau of Public Health Preparedness, Response and Recovery, and this is a new bureau that we'll be talking about a little bit later.

238
00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:41.000
This is preparing for and acting quickly in emergencies and disasters.

239
00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:50.500
We manage the continuity of operations planning, actually, for the department, safety and response plans for all hazard events.

240
00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:57.500
The bureau maintains the all-hazard warehouse, including the commissioner's stockpile of personal protective equipment.

241
00:28:57.500 --> 00:29:13.500
It maintains the New Hampshire Hospital's information management system, which does patient tracking, incident reporting, and inventory management, and this is used in emergency response, and supports behavioral health recovery after disasters.

242
00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:19.500
And then, um, Lisa, can I jump in just for a second?

243
00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:21.500
Of course.

244
00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:30.500
I just want to mention that Bureau that Lisa just discussed, that Bureau did exist in the department.

245
00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:33.500
It is new to public health.

246
00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:45.000
It was previously reported directly to the commissioner, um, and we have now moved it to report to the director of public health.

247
00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.000
Thank you, Karen.

248
00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:53.000
So when we look at it, it'll have FY20 and 21 money?

249
00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.000
It should.

250
00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:11.500
I don't remember if it does when we move an accounting unit, so we might have to refer you to another area to see the 20 and 21, but it did exist previously.

251
00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:25.000
Lastly, the prescription drug monitoring program, which is currently in a different agency within the state, but within the governor's budget has moved over to public health.

252
00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:33.000
And this drug monitoring program enhances patient care and prevents misuse and diversion of controlled substances.

253
00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:42.000
And this program manages the web-based database of the prescribing, opioid prescribing history and other controlled substance history.

254
00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:54.500
It provides feedback and training for prescribers and pharmacists, and it analyzes data trends to inform policymakers and stakeholders about prescription patterns of controlled substances.

255
00:30:54.500 --> 00:31:03.500
So I need to be clear again, because the title, New This Biennium, which one is this biennium?

256
00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:10.500
The one we're in, or are you referring to the one that we're budgeting?

257
00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:18.500
So the Bureau of Public Health Preparedness, Response, and Recovery has moved over to public health.

258
00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:22.500
So that is, it is current this year.

259
00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:24.500
It's a recent move.

260
00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:34.500
So it hasn't been that long since it's been part of the Division of Public Health from the Commissioner's office.

261
00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:38.500
The prescription drug monitoring program is a program.

262
00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:51.500
So when it is said new to DPHS, this program is within the 22-23 budget, but currently is not within the Division of Public Health Services.

263
00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:53.500
Okay.

264
00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:55.500
Thank you.

265
00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:57.500
Next slide.

266
00:31:57.500 --> 00:32:08.500
So I thought it would be important to talk about, you know, how we deliver services within the world of public health.

267
00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:34.000
And you can see here that there are many sectors involved in implementing services and programs for the citizens of New Hampshire, because we know that ensuring health outcomes happens at the community level with state support, which is how we proceed and how we manage our work that we do.

268
00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:57.000
So we work with hospitals, community health centers, the two health departments across the state, the public health networks, and all the stakeholders within communities, including businesses, the faith communities, family resource centers, first responders, and so forth and so on, as is on the list.

269
00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:08.000
In New Hampshire, different from other states, we don't have fully functional health departments based in communities other than Manchester and Nashua.

270
00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:19.000
So we rely on our community-based public health network system to be able to implement public health services at the community level.

271
00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:25.000
These 13 public health entities are connected to fiscal agents, mostly nonprofits.

272
00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:32.500
Some of them are standalone and many of them are connected to other nonprofit communities.

273
00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:43.000
So at this point, I'm going to turn the presentation over to Deputy Director Tilley to continue on in the presentation.

274
00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:50.500
I will move this slide as soon as it allows me to move this slide.

275
00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:52.500
There we go.

276
00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:54.500
Thank you so much.

277
00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:57.500
Thank you, Representative Edwards and committee.

278
00:33:57.500 --> 00:34:08.000
So from here, we would like to talk a little bit about some of the major accomplishments over the past biennium.

279
00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:17.000
So in July 2019, right at the beginning of our current biennium, we published our DPHS operational plan.

280
00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:23.500
And the goal of this really was to refresh and affirm our vision.

281
00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:45.000
I've already put those two together, as I always say, the mission, the mission, vision, and values to really develop a roadmap for our operational work to really strengthen our foundation and focused on planning, communication, workforce, data and information, and service delivery.

282
00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:59.500
So that's not to be confused with the work that we are beginning to undertake right now, which is our state health assessment and our state health improvement plan.

283
00:34:59.500 --> 00:35:16.500
That operational plan was really our readiness document to make sure that we had our own house in order, that we could move forward in addressing the larger issues that are impacting the state.

284
00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:41.000
So as many of you know, our SHA and our SHIP, the state health assessment, the state health improvement plan, are underway right now with a council, a legislatively appointed council, and we are deep in the weeds right now in the data collection process and the assessment process.

285
00:35:41.000 --> 00:36:05.000
Core also to our value of collaboration, we are an active participant on a number of integration activities, both within the department as well as within our communities, and those really focus on everything from environmental health to the prevention of adverse childhood experiences to the opioid crisis.

286
00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:09.500
We are participants in legislative councils and study committees.

287
00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:28.000
We have shared federally funded projects across divisions and departments, and we've used our expertise in data analysis to provide the data needed in many of these projects to improve health outcomes in each of these areas.

288
00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:43.500
So, as we think about some of those key accomplishments, we're going to go down a little bit again, sort of bureau by bureau, to give you a very high-level overview.

289
00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:56.500
Of course, we have to start with COVID, and as we've already discussed, most of the time when public health is working well, we are invisible.

290
00:36:56.500 --> 00:37:02.500
No one really thinks about whether their food and water is safe.

291
00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:08.000
We usually don't think about whether we can access primary care.

292
00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:14.000
Vaccines usually just appear at our doctor's office or our provider's office.

293
00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:19.000
And data is hopefully usually available when we need it.

294
00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:35.000
But the pandemic threw that all under the bus, and suddenly our public health systems were frankly stressed, and we experienced strains on our healthcare system and, of course, an economic fallout.

295
00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:43.000
Luckily, infectious disease investigation and emergency preparedness are the bread and butter of what we do.

296
00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:54.000
As we've already heard, in the past year, we've investigated, again, almost 80,000 cases, vaccinated, fully vaccinated, almost 10% of our population.

297
00:37:54.000 --> 00:38:03.000
Meanwhile, we continue to have some of the best rates in the country in things like childhood vaccine.

298
00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:09.500
The day-to-day work continues while we are aggressively managing and mitigating this pandemic.

299
00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:36.500
So our laboratory, as you noted in that earlier slide, has been working seven days a week, two shifts, and testing more than 220,000 samples for COVID compared to our normal volume in a year of about 40,000 samples, all while continuing that other important work in environmental health, in food and water testing.

300
00:38:36.500 --> 00:38:49.000
Our emergency services unit, as you just heard, has moved over to DPHS from the commissioner's office, and that was really done for better alignment.

301
00:38:49.000 --> 00:39:00.500
They have been working hand in hand with our infectious disease folks, our incident management team, homeland security, and the entire COVID response.

302
00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:09.000
And we found that this move has been really helpful to ensure communication and alignment of efforts.

303
00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:13.000
I have a question there on the lab.

304
00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:15.000
Yes, sorry.

305
00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:25.500
Is this lab fully functionally and physically separated from the lab that's used in the criminal justice system of New Hampshire?

306
00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:27.500
Correct, yes.

307
00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:33.500
We work together on some projects, but it is a separate lab.

308
00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:38.500
The public health lab is here at 29 Hazen Drive.

309
00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:41.500
Where is the criminal justice lab?

310
00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:47.500
I don't know that answer right off the top of my head.

311
00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:51.500
But it's not in the same building even?

312
00:39:51.500 --> 00:39:53.500
No.

313
00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:55.500
All right.

314
00:39:55.500 --> 00:39:57.500
Thank you.

315
00:39:57.500 --> 00:39:59.500
Thanks.

316
00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:01.500
Great.

317
00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:10.000
So let's focus a little bit here on some of the other core areas of public health.

318
00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:12.500
First off, certainly population health.

319
00:40:12.500 --> 00:40:25.000
New Hampshire continues to show significant progress with many chronic diseases, maternal and child health outcomes, and other population health measures such as teen births.

320
00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:31.500
We're the best in the country for the lowest number of teen births.

321
00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:41.000
Adult tobacco use continues to trend downward as compared to our youth vaping, which is really concerning going upwards.

322
00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:50.000
But adults, once you get older, you start to realize that you need to cut back on that.

323
00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:58.500
New Hampshire continues to rank among the top states for health status for both adults and children.

324
00:40:58.500 --> 00:41:07.000
We've launched a new campaign to address this youth vaping crisis called Save Your Breath New Hampshire.

325
00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:20.500
And it is a social media campaign that's had over a million impressions of likes and shares and all the things that you do on social media.

326
00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:29.500
It's on Snapchat and YouTube and TikTok and not just the places like Facebook where old people are.

327
00:41:29.500 --> 00:41:49.500
It's really aimed at that youth population because we've seen that this is really becoming quite an epidemic, which we are very concerned is going to have really long-term health outcomes and cost outcomes for the state of New Hampshire.

328
00:41:49.500 --> 00:42:02.500
Among our public health protection programs, we continue to work hand-in-hand with the Department of Environmental Services, which actually is also here in 29 Hazen Drive.

329
00:42:02.500 --> 00:42:12.500
That really eases some of our collaboration, and we use this to continue to track and reduce environmental health exposures.

330
00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:38.500
And because we know that children actually often face hazards where they live or where they play or where they go to school or learn, some of our work right now is really focused on helping folks like child care providers be able to site their programs in places that are healthy.

331
00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:58.000
And we use our expertise in data and health promotion and communication to really work collaboratively both with our Department of Environmental Services and folks like in our in our Child Care Bureau in other areas of the department.

332
00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:00.000
Our informatics.

333
00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:03.500
So I have a couple of questions.

334
00:43:03.500 --> 00:43:05.500
They're kind of different.

335
00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:15.000
But so in terms of performance metrics, you mentioned suicide prevention earlier, and here we have tobacco secession efforts.

336
00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:25.500
And I'm just curious if we what kind of metric we use to evaluate whether or not a program is effective?

337
00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:35.000
Because it just seems difficult to measure whether a program has prevented a suicide or prevented somebody from smoking.

338
00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:45.000
And so I'm just curious what kind of benchmarks and metrics you can use when you can't measure a negative.

339
00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:47.000
Sure.

340
00:43:47.000 --> 00:44:06.000
You know, this is the problem with prevention overall, and you'll sort of hear this repeated in any of our preventative work, whether it's suicide, tobacco, you know, working in prevention programs with young children, it's really hard.

341
00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:09.500
And I think you've landed on that.

342
00:44:09.500 --> 00:44:14.000
So what we do is we use the evidence.

343
00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:22.000
So we know that there are science-based programs that have gone through rigorous peer-reviewed journal studies.

344
00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:33.500
And so we model our programs with fidelity to those programs that have been shown in those rigorous evaluations to have been effective.

345
00:44:33.500 --> 00:44:41.000
So that's one way that we can feel confident that what we're doing is working.

346
00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:47.500
And then we measure ourselves against that sort of fidelity to those programs.

347
00:44:47.500 --> 00:44:50.000
We certainly measure the process.

348
00:44:50.000 --> 00:45:07.500
So someday when we're just talking, I'd like to dive into what's in those academic papers, because it just sounded like you said that in these heavily rigorous peer-reviewed journals, they're still measuring against something.

349
00:45:07.500 --> 00:45:09.500
There's still evidence.

350
00:45:09.500 --> 00:45:11.500
Yeah.

351
00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:20.500
And usually they have- That's what I'm really getting at, is what is the thing they measure against.

352
00:45:20.500 --> 00:45:22.500
Sure.

353
00:45:22.500 --> 00:45:45.000
In many of those, there's comparison groups in a way that we would not, when we put out a program, we tend not to do it only for one segment of the population and then measure outcomes of a group that didn't receive that intervention.

354
00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:48.000
And some of them are long-term.

355
00:45:48.000 --> 00:46:17.500
So things like early childhood, they've, you know, looked at that, the life course of that child for if that early, you know, what that early childhood intervention was, and then what their third grade reading score was, and then whether they were involved in juvenile justice, or whether, you know, they went on to have a successful life.

356
00:46:17.500 --> 00:46:24.000
So those are the studies that we base on those rigorous evidence-based programs.

357
00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:26.000
That's just an example.

358
00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:28.000
Okay, that's great.

359
00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:38.000
I'm not trying to be rude, even though I am, but we just got to get to the 70 accounts.

360
00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:42.000
So I got another short question for you.

361
00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:44.000
Great.

362
00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:48.500
On protection, you've got visual inspections for food establishments.

363
00:46:48.500 --> 00:46:50.500
Yeah.

364
00:46:50.500 --> 00:46:54.500
And that excites the telemedicine guy in me.

365
00:46:54.500 --> 00:47:01.500
So I would like to hear what you're doing and how great it is.

366
00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:10.000
Well, I will give a good, I will give you an overview, a very high level overview.

367
00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:16.000
So, you know, COVID happened and yet our restaurants were still open.

368
00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:24.000
And quite honestly, they had lots of questions as they were implementing the governor's executive orders.

369
00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:32.500
And we wanted to make sure that our staff were safe as well as sending them out.

370
00:47:32.500 --> 00:47:46.000
So we have started doing these virtual inspections using both video technology and our food inspectors to help understand what their challenges were, what their questions were.

371
00:47:46.000 --> 00:48:08.000
We have Michelle Roberge sitting in the audience if you want to get deeper in that, or we can come back to you later on and provide some additional information exactly of how many and where they were and what the feedback has been.

372
00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:21.000
Other than generally that feedback's been incredibly positive to be able to make sure that our food inspectors are available to our folks around the state.

373
00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:31.000
Okay, so I don't need to know more before the 24th of March, but it is a topic of interest.

374
00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:36.000
We'd love to get more information to you on that.

375
00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:44.000
It could be very powerful and something that should be sustained after the pandemic, I hope.

376
00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:46.000
So, all right.

377
00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:48.000
Sure.

378
00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:50.000
Thanks.

379
00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:52.000
No, absolutely.

380
00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:55.000
So we'll just round up today.

381
00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:58.500
This slide, again, informatics, data governance, integration.

382
00:48:58.500 --> 00:49:05.000
This has been a tremendous work that we've done, again, within our department.

383
00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:19.000
We're strong partners with Dave Wieters to ensure that as a department, we have one governance system, and we are looking at security in a very robust way.

384
00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:33.500
And then, of course, what's available to the public, what you all see are these fancy new dashboards that are interactive and available in a transparent and timely way.

385
00:49:33.500 --> 00:49:37.500
Never before have we given you day-to-day data.

386
00:49:37.500 --> 00:49:43.500
And so we've really been excited by the progress that they've made.

387
00:49:43.500 --> 00:49:57.500
In a policy and performance world, which is my world, you know, again, we continue to support our health workers with something called the state loan repayment program.

388
00:49:57.500 --> 00:50:04.500
And that's where we help do loan repayment for providers that serve underserved communities.

389
00:50:04.500 --> 00:50:11.500
And then of course, we've been providing pandemic support for our critical access hospitals.

390
00:50:11.500 --> 00:50:25.000
As Lisa noted, we support the entire system, we support the entire state, but then we really focused in on some of those that are most vulnerable.

391
00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:33.500
And in the healthcare system, that's our critical access I'm going to go ahead and get started.

392
00:50:33.500 --> 00:50:53.500
Lisa noted we support the entire system, we support the entire state, but then we really focus in on some of those that are most vulnerable, and in the healthcare system, that's our critical access hospitals in our rural areas.

393
00:50:53.500 --> 00:50:59.000
So I'll flip it over here to some of the challenges.

394
00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:14.000
I can talk about the great things forever, but you certainly want to know where some of the areas that we're a little stuck and have had some uphill challenges.

395
00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:50.000
So structurally, we are continually faced with maintaining, replacing our critical laboratory equipment, recruiting a pipeline of qualified staff, especially to support our core mission as our aging population, our aging staff, you know, go out to the great beyond of retirement as we wish them well, we need to ensure that we've got a pipeline of folks that are willing to come and work with us to maintain these core services.

396
00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:52.000
We have other challenges.

397
00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:59.000
So on the aging laboratory instrumentation, I assume almost all of that is capital.

398
00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:06.000
Okay, so that's in the capital budget that we won't be talking about today.

399
00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:08.500
Some of it is capital.

400
00:52:08.500 --> 00:52:16.500
Some of it we put into other federal funding where it's appropriate and within our budgets.

401
00:52:16.500 --> 00:52:18.500
Okay.

402
00:52:18.500 --> 00:52:26.000
Other challenges that are more population-based, you know, so things like an older housing stock.

403
00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:33.500
So you might think that's not, that doesn't have anything to do with public health.

404
00:52:33.500 --> 00:52:44.000
Well, in fact, that older housing stock means that we have housing with significant lead risk and lead risk to children.

405
00:52:44.000 --> 00:53:05.500
So, you know, we have disparities where we even see things like our new Americans, new refugees, people of color are moving into older housing stock and have these higher rates of lead exposure as a result of environmental exposures in the house.

406
00:53:05.500 --> 00:53:46.500
We were thrilled that in several sessions ago, we made it mandatory now that all one and two-year-olds, regardless, are tested for lead because even though we have disparities in some populations we may think about, like if I were to ask you to write down where you think that problem is, we also have disparities that individuals across the economic spectrum are moving into homes that are older, doing some home repairs, and end up poisoning their own children with lead.

407
00:53:46.500 --> 00:54:03.000
So it's important across the population, although we're very focused on probably the most vulnerable populations, making sure those in rental markets get access to screening and then the care that they need.

408
00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:09.500
I don't know if you can see me when I raise my hand.

409
00:54:09.500 --> 00:54:13.500
I'm looking at my notes on the slide.

410
00:54:13.500 --> 00:54:15.500
So it's a little.

411
00:54:15.500 --> 00:54:17.500
Okay.

412
00:54:17.500 --> 00:54:19.500
Thank you.

413
00:54:19.500 --> 00:54:22.000
I just hate barging in.

414
00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:24.000
Okay.

415
00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:37.000
But so on refugees, do we do a screening of adult refugees when they first get to New Hampshire so that we have a lead baseline?

416
00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:39.000
So we do screening.

417
00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:52.500
There's our Office of Minority Health, our health equity, now that it's called, works closely with the community and they do a number of health screenings there.

418
00:54:52.500 --> 00:55:06.000
But we know in particular this issue around blood lead levels, we test the children within three months of arrival when they land in the housing here.

419
00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:20.500
So, you know, we also know that, again, that older housing stock, if you've lived here for generations or you're a new American, older housing stock is a risk.

420
00:55:20.500 --> 00:55:23.500
I don't doubt any of that.

421
00:55:23.500 --> 00:55:42.500
I'm just wondering if we get a baseline when the newly arrived get here so that we don't assume it's our own lead environment as opposed to the environment they're escaping from, which is probably not great either.

422
00:55:42.500 --> 00:55:44.500
Nope.

423
00:55:44.500 --> 00:55:53.500
So, again, there are some health screenings that are done and coordinated through the Office of Health Equity.

424
00:55:53.500 --> 00:56:03.000
Environmental, some of the other challenges we have, again, population-based, we have a really high rate of bladder cancer.

425
00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:10.000
And in fact, we have the highest rate of bladder cancer in the country.

426
00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:13.500
That's not a cancer we talk about.

427
00:56:13.500 --> 00:56:17.500
There's not like a big bladder cancer month.

428
00:56:17.500 --> 00:56:27.000
But it can be tied back to some environmental issues to arsenic that is in our private water wells.

429
00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:58.000
And so we have, you know, this is a place where we look at it both from a population health perspective, and also try to ensure that we put in functions like really support well water testing, and really try to provide education to folks of why that's so important, because there are health risks that could come from your private well.

430
00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:32.500
And, you know, while we've seen improvements in unintentional injury deaths, including overdose over the past year or so, you know, we know that New Hampshire residents are still disproportionately impacted by substance and alcohol use, you know, all of which create costly and poor health outcomes at the end of the day from infections, from cancer, and then things even like neonatal abstinence syndrome among the little ones.

431
00:57:32.500 --> 00:57:44.000
So these are some of the high-level challenges that we're facing within these bureaus, across these bureaus, and it impacts our entire work.

432
00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:47.000
So I'm going to stop there.

433
00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:49.500
Actually, I will move on.

434
00:57:49.500 --> 00:58:01.500
I think Karen wanted me to jump to the end of our presentation right now and talk a little bit about some priority needs.

435
00:58:01.500 --> 00:58:12.500
So you're going to see me flip through these slides very quickly to get to the end because it's my last slide.

436
00:58:12.500 --> 00:58:17.500
So don't have an epileptic seizure watching those slides move.

437
00:58:17.500 --> 00:58:23.500
Whoops, we'll go back to this and then it's the end here.

438
00:58:23.500 --> 00:58:27.000
I think it's the very last slide.

439
00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:29.000
There you go.

440
00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:31.500
Yeah, thank you so much.

441
00:58:31.500 --> 00:58:42.000
So, you know, one of the things that we have been talking about a little bit are some of the needs.

442
00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:52.500
And DPHS has a couple of requests that are not in our budget right now, but we did note as priorities.

443
00:58:52.500 --> 00:59:09.500
So, and this is one where also the governor's office is particularly interested in understanding how we might be able to better support prevention services for young families and young children and their families.

444
00:59:09.500 --> 00:59:21.500
So many different services are available to guide and assist parents-to-be and parents of young children in those early stages of raising a family.

445
00:59:21.500 --> 00:59:51.000
In public health, we focus on the programs that have been shown to improve health outcomes, as I was talking about before, such as maternal depression, premature birth, low birth weight, neonatal abstinence syndrome, and other adverse childhood experiences that ultimately lead to costly and poor chronic disease and behavioral health problems as those children grow up into adults.

446
00:59:51.000 --> 01:00:01.000
So some of these programs include our Healthy Families America, which you've heard about, which is our home visiting program.

447
01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:11.500
We support activities at our family resource centers that I know that you've heard about when Chris Santanello did her presentation.

448
01:00:11.500 --> 01:00:24.500
We have programs like our community collaborations, which again is some federal funding that we get to support communities in coordinating around working with young kids.

449
01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:41.000
All of these services are slightly different, but they share the same goal of promoting healthy pregnancies, positive birth outcomes, and creating those safe and nurturing environments for kids and families to grow.

450
01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:47.500
So public health has a number of federally funded programs that do this.

451
01:00:47.500 --> 01:01:12.000
But we in the current biennium, so not the next biennium where you're looking at the budget, but currently we had had the opportunity to use some general funds to be able to do some additional outreach to populations we weren't able to cover with those federally funded programs.

452
01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:38.500
So in particular, we did some really interesting work around substance exposed infants, ensuring that, and we work very closely with our prenatal providers, our hospitals, to ensure that they were doing their safe plans of care, which is something that DCYF requires them to do to get families set up for success.

453
01:01:38.500 --> 01:02:06.000
And then we were helping them understand how to connect to programs like Our Home Visiting, which has that evidence base to ensure that we can get closer to lower preterm birth rates, lower low birth weights, getting families screened for depression, and connecting them all while doing developmental services for their kids as well.

454
01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:21.500
So that's been a really exciting project where we've doubled the number of substance exposed infants that were in some of those programs, those pilots that we funded with general funds.

455
01:02:21.500 --> 01:02:37.500
So we just wanted to leave this as a note, sort of as a consideration as you're thinking about the budget, that there may be opportunities to continue this really important work.

456
01:02:37.500 --> 01:02:46.000
So I will leave it there and hand it over to Karen, unless there's any more questions.

457
01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
I'll stop sharing.

458
01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:51.000
Sorry, I put myself on mute.

459
01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:54.000
So Representative Wollner has a question.

460
01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
Thank you.

461
01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:01.000
I never know whether you can see the hand up.

462
01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
I could see you.

463
01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:09.500
I was just speaking to a muted mic, so it wasn't very effective.

464
01:03:09.500 --> 01:03:11.500
Thank you.

465
01:03:11.500 --> 01:03:32.000
Trish, I was wondering about when we get to the pages in the budget book, where those priority programs are that are not funded, but you did request them of the governor's budget, but they were not in the governor's budget.

466
01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:39.000
Will you be sure to point those out to us as we go along?

467
01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:44.500
Yes, yes, we will do that with Karen and Shelly's help.

468
01:03:44.500 --> 01:03:46.500
Okay, great.

469
01:03:46.500 --> 01:03:48.500
Thank you.

470
01:03:48.500 --> 01:03:50.500
Ms.

471
01:03:50.500 --> 01:03:59.000
Tilling, I'm looking at the bottom rung here where it says home visiting and outreach to families.

472
01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:04.500
And I'm just curious about the nature of those home visits.

473
01:04:04.500 --> 01:04:11.000
Is there a percentage that's truly voluntary where the parents want you in?

474
01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:21.500
And is there another portion that's court compelled somehow, whether a search warrant or a court order, this is 100% voluntary?

475
01:04:21.500 --> 01:04:26.000
Everything we do in public health is 100% voluntary.

476
01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
It's prevention-based.

477
01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:32.000
These are not what we're trying to do.

478
01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:41.000
I think you sometimes hear Director Ripson talk about keeping people out of the front door of DCYF.

479
01:04:41.000 --> 01:05:15.000
We're trying to keep people somewhere out in the yard, like somewhere way before they get to the porch or the front door, that we're really providing those prevention services, which really means family support, parenting education, education around childhood development, to really make sure that those families stay as safe as possible before there's a problem, which is why it's really important for us to begin prenatally.

480
01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:21.000
And we're right there from the beginning when those babies are born.

481
01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
And it's a partnership.

482
01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
So it's not coerced.

483
01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
It's not scary.

484
01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:31.000
Like, you know, DCYF can feel scary sometimes.

485
01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
This is really prevention.

486
01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:39.500
So we work hand in hand with child welfare to keep folks out.

487
01:05:39.500 --> 01:05:41.500
So that sounds good.

488
01:05:41.500 --> 01:05:50.500
Do you see any pressures building within this community to want to be able to compel home visits?

489
01:05:50.500 --> 01:05:57.000
So I think, you know, certainly Director Ribson can speak better to that.

490
01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:06.000
You know, there are individuals who would like to be able to offer this service to more folks.

491
01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:32.000
You know, we've been, because we have limited federal dollars, we've narrowed down to, you know, people that might come with some risk factors, so risk factors like a history of substance use or, you know, poverty in particular and, you know, other, you know, other factor, young age is another one.

492
01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:36.000
So, you know, really young moms and dads.

493
01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:44.000
So there are some people that would like to open that door a little bit wider.

494
01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:48.000
but certainly not in the public health world.

495
01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:56.500
Is there any movement for compelling anyone to participate in something they don't want to participate in?

496
01:06:56.500 --> 01:06:58.500
Thank you for that.

497
01:06:58.500 --> 01:07:01.500
Representative Walner, your hand is up.

498
01:07:01.500 --> 01:07:04.500
Representative Walner, can you hear me?

499
01:07:04.500 --> 01:07:07.000
She can't hear you, Jess.

500
01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:14.500
I'm going to assume her hand is up from the previous question and move on.

501
01:07:14.500 --> 01:07:16.500
Okay.

502
01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:18.500
Thank you.

503
01:07:18.500 --> 01:07:21.000
It's entertaining as I expected.

504
01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
I appreciate it.

505
01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
We try.

506
01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
Thank you.

507
01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
Karen will be great.

508
01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
All right.

509
01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:34.000
Go ahead and share my screen.

510
01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:44.500
So because all of these accounting units are straight through, I'm not gonna bounce between the presentation and the accounting units.

511
01:07:44.500 --> 01:07:56.000
We're just gonna start on page 1014 and go all the way through to, I think it's like 1098 or something like that.

512
01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:05.500
So the first accounting unit on page 1014 is accounting unit 5110, which is the office of the director.

513
01:08:05.500 --> 01:08:08.000
Give me just a second.

514
01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:14.000
I'm trying to get my screens ready to do this with you.

515
01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
Contact shifting.

516
01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
So this is 5110.

517
01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
Thank you.

518
01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
context shifting.

519
01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
So this is 5110.

520
01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:44.500
So this is an area so Shelley has been in her role about three years about the same amount of time as I have been and that's something I should have shared when we talked about finance at a grand level.

521
01:08:44.500 --> 01:08:57.500
Other than Athena, who you saw present with Medicaid, everyone else at a senior level in finance has been in their role less than three years.

522
01:08:57.500 --> 01:09:07.000
Some have been with the department a very long time, but they've only been in their roles for years.

523
01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:11.000
So we are a very new finance group.

524
01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:24.500
And so that's why you're seeing a lot of changes and a lot of improvements, because we are working hard to change the way we do business.

525
01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:33.000
And so one of the things that public health finance worked really hard on was cost allocation.

526
01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:37.500
And they're continuing to do that, which is awesome.

527
01:09:37.500 --> 01:09:43.500
And so that's why you see a shift here in the revenue.

528
01:09:43.500 --> 01:09:55.500
And you see agency income here because we are actually cost allocating from agency income that's received throughout the division to the director level.

529
01:09:55.500 --> 01:10:02.000
So that's a really exciting thing for us to start making those shifts.

530
01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:09.000
So as I'm looking at the personnel I see two permanent and two unclassified.

531
01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
Yes.

532
01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:19.000
And I think there are three of those four people probably on the call right now.

533
01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
Yes.

534
01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:26.500
Did the fourth person get in trouble and not get invited?

535
01:10:26.500 --> 01:10:28.500
No.

536
01:10:28.500 --> 01:10:34.000
So actually, Shelly would have been in the finance accounting unit.

537
01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:45.500
So this is Lisa and Trish, and then I assume that's your admin assistant and I'm not sure who the fourth one is.

538
01:10:45.500 --> 01:10:50.000
If you have a second admin, I'm not sure.

539
01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
Can I jump in?

540
01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
Yes.

541
01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:58.500
So the two unclassified positions, are they listed here?

542
01:10:58.500 --> 01:11:04.500
Yeah, in this particular accounting unit are Lisa Morris and Ben Chan.

543
01:11:04.500 --> 01:11:06.500
Oh, it's Ben.

544
01:11:06.500 --> 01:11:08.500
OK.

545
01:11:08.500 --> 01:11:12.000
The two permanent classifieds are administrative positions.

546
01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:16.000
So I thought I had assumed that Ms.

547
01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:22.000
Tilley being a deputy director would be one of those four people.

548
01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
You will find Ms.

549
01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.500
Tilley in accounting unit 5362.

550
01:11:26.500 --> 01:11:33.000
Representative Irv, do you have any questions on any of these line items?

551
01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:36.500
I know you've been combing through these.

552
01:11:36.500 --> 01:11:46.000
No, this one actually, if you look at it, looks pretty favorable to us in terms of federal funding.

553
01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
Thank you.

554
01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:53.000
So that was just one and we have 69 more?

555
01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
Something like that, yes.

556
01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
Oh okay, keep going.

557
01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
We're gonna get there.

558
01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:03.000
We might even get to have lunch today.

559
01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
Unemployment compensation 8579 self-explanatory.

560
01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:08.500
So 5262 is informatics and health statistics.

561
01:12:08.500 --> 01:12:19.000
So my order is different than your order because I'm using the spreadsheet because I can keep notes right on it.

562
01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:22.000
And that doesn't work very well.

563
01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
Okay.

564
01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.500
So, oh, there it is.

565
01:12:26.500 --> 01:12:28.500
Yep.

566
01:12:28.500 --> 01:12:30.500
I got it.

567
01:12:30.500 --> 01:12:36.500
So you have eight permanent classified and you're, you're adding one here.

568
01:12:36.500 --> 01:12:46.500
Can you talk about how many you actually have hired at the moment and what this new role will do?

569
01:12:46.500 --> 01:12:50.500
Shelley, is that position moved from somewhere else?

570
01:12:50.500 --> 01:12:54.000
Yeah, we didn't add any new positions.

571
01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
We just realigned positions.

572
01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:08.500
So we took a position out of a different accounting unit that really belongs in with informatics and data analytics and moved it in here.

573
01:13:08.500 --> 01:13:15.500
I am not sure of the vacancy rate off the top of my head.

574
01:13:15.500 --> 01:13:21.000
So I would have to get back to you on that.

575
01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:31.500
So I'm looking, just so you know, if you didn't hear earlier, I'm looking at the aggregate level for public health.

576
01:13:31.500 --> 01:13:37.000
You know, how many folks you have hired today versus authorized.

577
01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
So all right.

578
01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
Thank you.

579
01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:44.500
Do you have any questions, Representative Earth?

580
01:13:44.500 --> 01:13:46.500
No.

581
01:13:46.500 --> 01:13:52.500
I think the next one is 8667 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey.

582
01:13:52.500 --> 01:13:59.500
What are our private, excuse me, we have private local funds going to this.

583
01:13:59.500 --> 01:14:01.500
What is that?

584
01:14:01.500 --> 01:14:07.000
Those funds come to us either from Dartmouth or from UNH.

585
01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:12.500
They also come to us from organizations like the Alzheimer's Association.

586
01:14:12.500 --> 01:14:18.000
It just feels unusual for people to give the state money.

587
01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:22.500
What is incentivizing them to give us this money?

588
01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:26.000
If I may interrupt, if that's okay.

589
01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:44.000
The organizations provide those funds so that we can add questions to the CDC survey called the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System because they want to know about health outcomes in their particular areas of interest.

590
01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:50.500
We're helping them do research and they're helping us with their research money.

591
01:14:50.500 --> 01:14:54.000
You could look at it that way.

592
01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:58.000
Thank you for not correcting me in public.

593
01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
All right.

594
01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
Okay.

595
01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:09.000
Coming down to the bottom of page 1019 is 2218, the hospital flex program.

596
01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.500
This is 100% federally funded.

597
01:15:11.500 --> 01:15:15.500
What are we asking the hospitals to flex?

598
01:15:15.500 --> 01:15:18.500
I'll take this one as well.

599
01:15:18.500 --> 01:15:20.500
Thank you.

600
01:15:20.500 --> 01:15:35.500
This is funds through our rural health and primary care program, and this provides support to hospital programs to do different TA and support to maintain their health care system.

601
01:15:35.500 --> 01:15:42.500
So we work closely with the hospital association and the foundation for healthy families.

602
01:15:42.500 --> 01:15:51.000
The next one is 2,219, which is the small hospital improvement, which the director spoke to earlier.

603
01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:57.000
There is a small amount of general funds in this accounting amount.

604
01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:04.000
So to your question earlier, Chair, it is, we're only spending about $160,000 there.

605
01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:07.000
What can you do with $160,000?

606
01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:11.500
It just seems like kind of an odd number.

607
01:16:11.500 --> 01:16:16.000
It's not big enough to really have a program.

608
01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:19.500
It's not small enough to just eliminate.

609
01:16:19.500 --> 01:16:29.000
When we spend this money, when we spend the federal money, what work or infrastructure is actually getting built?

610
01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:35.000
So many times we're hiring consultants to work with the small hospitals.

611
01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:45.000
So like that claims denial program, we've hired consultants to come in and provide training and the small hospitals participate.

612
01:16:45.000 --> 01:17:00.000
They help us choose what it is that they want to focus on and how to best spend those funds to really improve their clinical care and their bottom line.

613
01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
Okay.

614
01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
Very good.

615
01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
Quick question.

616
01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
Yes.

617
01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
Representative Irv.

618
01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:19.000
So I really did very small numbers, but just like curiosity, is there a general funds match required?

619
01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.500
Why is $3,000 in there?

620
01:17:21.500 --> 01:17:24.500
I'd like to respond to that.

621
01:17:24.500 --> 01:17:26.500
This was overlooked actually.

622
01:17:26.500 --> 01:18:07.500
in the governor's phase, we made a lot of corrections because we had mistakenly budgeted general funds in many of our accounting units because of class 41 and 42 and it was a new tool that we used that we we weren't used to so we made a lot of corrections but I think I missed this particular accounting unit because this one is supposed to be 100 federal so we'll be putting in a budget change request to get that corrected.

623
01:18:07.500 --> 01:18:10.500
Thank you, that makes more sense.

624
01:18:10.500 --> 01:18:12.500
Sure.

625
01:18:12.500 --> 01:18:20.000
5362 at the bottom of the page here is public health systems policy and performance.

626
01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:23.000
I'm not hearing any questions, so.

627
01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:26.000
No, I do have a question.

628
01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:36.000
So this looks relatively level funded from your adjusted authorized, but it's a jump from 20 actual in general funds.

629
01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:39.000
So why is it bouncing around?

630
01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.500
I guess what I'm wondering.

631
01:18:41.500 --> 01:18:49.000
Shelley, was there an issue there of the general fund earned from fiscal year 20?

632
01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
It's possible Karen.

633
01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
We also, this account.

634
01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:57.000
the general fund earned from fiscal year 20?

635
01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
It's possible Karen.

636
01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:09.000
We also, this accounting unit now has the deputy director in it and it didn't before and it doesn't currently.

637
01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:17.500
So her position is allocated so there would be more general funds coming in here as well.

638
01:19:17.500 --> 01:19:24.000
And I can check on the actual amounts to see what that entails.

639
01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
Thanks.

640
01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
Sure.

641
01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
Okay 79.60.

642
01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:49.000
So I guess you said you're going to get back to us, but the FY20 at $45,000 jump into a quarter million in the next year and then staying at that level, that's just a really big jump.

643
01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:52.000
So you're going to explain that?

644
01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
Yes.

645
01:19:54.000 --> 01:20:00.000
okay the next accounting unit is 7965 which is rural health Okay.

646
01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:06.500
The next accounting unit is 7965, which is rural health and primary care.

647
01:20:06.500 --> 01:20:09.500
What was that number again, Karen?

648
01:20:09.500 --> 01:20:11.500
7965.

649
01:20:11.500 --> 01:20:15.000
This one kind of did a yo-yo.

650
01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:23.500
From 20 to 21, it went down a lot and then it climbed back up in 22.

651
01:20:23.500 --> 01:20:27.500
Is this the accounting unit where SLRP is?

652
01:20:27.500 --> 01:20:29.500
Yes.

653
01:20:29.500 --> 01:20:46.000
So the increase, part of the increase that you're seeing there is there were funds for SLRP, for the state loan repayment fund, that were appropriated in for fiscal year 20 and 21.

654
01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:55.000
And so some of those contracts did not go through GNC until the end of fiscal year 20.

655
01:20:55.000 --> 01:21:01.000
So what is shown in 22 and 23 is funding those contracts.

656
01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:08.500
So the SLRP checks to the students or the professionals is in line 102 expense?

657
01:21:08.500 --> 01:21:12.000
I think it might be in 103.

658
01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:15.000
Are you okay, it is 102.

659
01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.500
No, I'm sorry, you're right.

660
01:21:17.500 --> 01:21:19.500
It is in 103.

661
01:21:19.500 --> 01:21:24.500
Contracts for operational services is what I assume OP means.

662
01:21:24.500 --> 01:21:26.500
Yes.

663
01:21:26.500 --> 01:21:38.500
How many SLRT beneficiaries do you think there were, not looking for an exact number, but how many are projected for FY21 SLRP beneficiaries?

664
01:21:38.500 --> 01:21:40.500
I'll take that.

665
01:21:40.500 --> 01:21:46.000
We have usually between 70 and 90 in a fiscal year.

666
01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:52.000
It varies because depending on your profession, we reimburse at different rates.

667
01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:59.000
So a medical doctor gets a higher loan repayment than, say, an M layback.

668
01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:07.000
Okay, so 70 to 90 currently, and then we're tripling the money in the next budget.

669
01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:10.000
So what's your projected client count?

670
01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:18.000
So although the class 103 only chose $250,000, there was actually an HB4 appropriation of $4,000,000.

671
01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.500
It was several million dollars.

672
01:22:20.500 --> 01:22:26.000
So that would not be reflected in the adjusted authorized there.

673
01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:31.500
But we're projecting to not spend about $4,000,000 of that currently.

674
01:22:31.500 --> 01:22:39.500
I understand it's just the opposite of that, that the HB4 is in the adjusted authorized.

675
01:22:39.500 --> 01:22:41.500
It is not.

676
01:22:41.500 --> 01:22:45.000
It's not there until we appropriate it.

677
01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:49.000
So once it's appropriated, then it will show.

678
01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:52.000
It does show in our current...

679
01:22:52.000 --> 01:23:01.500
Actually, we appropriated it in fiscal year 20, so that's why it's not showing in 21, and it's non-lapsing.

680
01:23:01.500 --> 01:23:06.500
You have a follow-up, and then Representative Wollner is ready.

681
01:23:06.500 --> 01:23:09.000
Well, you say it's non-lapsing.

682
01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:13.500
How did the adjusted authorized go down from FY20?

683
01:23:13.500 --> 01:23:20.000
When it's non-lapsing, it doesn't change the adjusted authorized in the future years.

684
01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:23.000
So how do we see that?

685
01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:28.500
In our statement of appropriations, it shows as a balance forward.

686
01:23:28.500 --> 01:23:30.500
Okay.

687
01:23:30.500 --> 01:23:37.500
So back to your statement about until you authorize it, it doesn't show up.

688
01:23:37.500 --> 01:23:47.000
So does that mean some HP4 things are already in the adjusted authorized or none are in there yet?

689
01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:52.000
So most of them we appropriated in fiscal year 20.

690
01:23:52.000 --> 01:24:02.000
If they were non-lapsing in the biennium, there were some HP4 appropriations, I think, that were designated for each year.

691
01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:06.500
So those we would have appropriated already, I believe.

692
01:24:06.500 --> 01:24:12.000
So they should be showing in the adjusted authorized for 21.

693
01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:19.500
But if they were appropriated in 20 and not spent, you wouldn't see them here.

694
01:24:19.500 --> 01:24:21.500
Okay.

695
01:24:21.500 --> 01:24:29.000
So you acknowledge that the adjusted authorized is higher than the budget, 21 versus 21.

696
01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:41.000
So because of the carry forward we do have enough funds we're not needing to transfer funds from anywhere else or anything like that.

697
01:24:41.000 --> 01:25:04.500
no i didn't mean specifically in this um account i mean generally overall the the your fy 21 adjusted authorized total general funds is higher than your fy 21 budgeted general funds so So does that mean that some of those accounts have had their HB4 numbers?

698
01:25:04.500 --> 01:25:07.000
What was the word used?

699
01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
Authorized?

700
01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
So they appear- Appropriated?

701
01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
Appropriated.

702
01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:21.000
I would say yes, but I'd have to walk through each of the different HB4 appropriations.

703
01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:27.500
Well, what else would be in the adjusted authorized other than HB4 appropriations?

704
01:25:27.500 --> 01:25:29.500
HB3 appropriations.

705
01:25:29.500 --> 01:25:32.000
It's HB3 and HB4, right?

706
01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:35.000
So it's all the HB3 appropriations.

707
01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:40.000
I'm talking about the difference between HB3 and adjusted authorized.

708
01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:50.500
So what changes with adjusted authorized are things that we've either gone to fiscal committee or were in other budget bills.

709
01:25:50.500 --> 01:25:55.500
So it may not have always been in HB 4.

710
01:25:55.500 --> 01:26:00.500
There were appropriations in HB 11 last biennium as well.

711
01:26:00.500 --> 01:26:04.000
There might have been another one too.

712
01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:09.500
So it could include anything that was in a different bill.

713
01:26:09.500 --> 01:26:11.500
Okay.

714
01:26:11.500 --> 01:26:13.500
Thanks.

715
01:26:13.500 --> 01:26:16.500
So Representative Walmer, you're on mute.

716
01:26:16.500 --> 01:26:18.500
Thank you.

717
01:26:18.500 --> 01:26:22.000
My phone was ringing, so I muted.

718
01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:28.000
So you said that there were $6 million in House Bill 4.

719
01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:32.500
and we did not spend down that $6 million.

720
01:26:32.500 --> 01:26:36.500
What was that $6 million scheduled to do?

721
01:26:36.500 --> 01:26:42.000
What were we supposed to be doing with that $6 million?

722
01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:48.500
So it was intended to be used for the state loan repayment program.

723
01:26:48.500 --> 01:27:06.000
The funds were not spent, of course, during the pandemic because there was a spending freeze during, well, the pandemic is still happening, but during the beginning of the pandemic, there was a spending freeze.

724
01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:22.500
And we actually temporarily used those general funds to do things like buy PPE and all that kind of stuff until there were federal funds available and then we transferred those funds back.

725
01:27:22.500 --> 01:27:41.000
It is my understanding and I would really direct the question to the governor's office that because I don't know the new program that well but there's a program in HB2 that's intended to replace this program.

726
01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:51.500
So we've only funded those contracts at current levels, understanding that the intent is for there to be a different program.

727
01:27:51.500 --> 01:27:53.500
Could I follow up?

728
01:27:53.500 --> 01:27:58.000
Do you know where in HB 2 that is?

729
01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:02.000
It must be assigned to a different division.

730
01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
I believe it is.

731
01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:11.500
I think it's education if I remember correctly, but I don't know that for certain.

732
01:28:11.500 --> 01:28:16.000
I would definitely direct that to the governor's office.

733
01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:32.500
Okay, chairman, I think that might be something we would want to talk to division two a little bit about that particular program, especially since before it was in the public health budget.

734
01:28:32.500 --> 01:28:34.500
Okay.

735
01:28:34.500 --> 01:28:36.500
You can.

736
01:28:36.500 --> 01:28:38.500
Thank you.

737
01:28:38.500 --> 01:28:40.500
Okay.

738
01:28:40.500 --> 01:28:42.500
I'll just agree.

739
01:28:42.500 --> 01:28:52.000
I'm not sure when the division chairs do their huddles with their committees, other than full finance committee hearings.

740
01:28:52.000 --> 01:29:06.500
so so so i would encourage you to go ahead and make an informal phone call to start the conversation and we'll figure out how to have it formally.

741
01:29:06.500 --> 01:29:08.500
OK, thank you.

742
01:29:08.500 --> 01:29:15.500
I guess my last question around SLRP is, your hand's still up, Representative Warner.

743
01:29:15.500 --> 01:29:51.000
My last last question around slurp is do we have any measures of effectiveness because i would hope that what we're doing with this money is trying to incentivize people to move here or people to stay here and because we don't have enough money to pay our all our health care professionals um to to for the status quo so So how do we know that these are effective spends?

744
01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
I'll take that.

745
01:29:53.000 --> 01:30:03.000
So as part of their contract, they have to commit to staying serving an underserved healthcare provider for three years.

746
01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:18.500
That's the, you know, as part of the terms of the contract, and we are collecting data now trying to figure out sort of the long term, how long people stay.

747
01:30:18.500 --> 01:30:52.000
We're particularly happy if they stay where there are, but we're also happy if after those three years or even within those three years, if they move around from, you know, for example, one federally qualified health center to another federally qualified health center, we consider that a still a net win for the state of New Hampshire that we've attracted and kept that kind of personnel.

748
01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.500
Thank you for the answer.

749
01:30:54.500 --> 01:30:58.000
Representative Weiler, you have a question, sir?

750
01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:01.500
Let's see if the space bar works.

751
01:31:01.500 --> 01:31:03.500
It works fine.

752
01:31:03.500 --> 01:31:05.500
All right.

753
01:31:05.500 --> 01:31:26.000
I just wanted to tell Representative Walner that the area I've been working on with the 529 program on page 68 in the HB2 is where the governor has switched some of these programs where they're paying people that studied medicine.

754
01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:32.500
and it's under this, the money that comes from Fidelity, from the 529.

755
01:31:32.500 --> 01:31:47.000
And it used to all go to scholarships and endowments, but now the governor has changed that around and he's taken 60% of it to go to these scholarships.

756
01:31:47.000 --> 01:32:05.500
But what that means is we don't need general funds for this $6 million that might have been in there before, because now he's getting it out of the Fidelity money, which has increased quite a bit.

757
01:32:05.500 --> 01:32:07.500
Thank you.

758
01:32:07.500 --> 01:32:09.500
Great.

759
01:32:09.500 --> 01:32:11.500
Thank you.

760
01:32:11.500 --> 01:32:15.000
Chairman Weiler, what was that page again?

761
01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
It was 68?

762
01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000
Page 68.

763
01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:26.000
It starts with the endowment scholarship fund, and then it sticks in another part.

764
01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:30.500
it goes for five pages, describe the whole thing.

765
01:32:30.500 --> 01:32:45.000
So what I've done is after meeting with the 529, I put in an amendment on that page where it goes 20% to direct student and 20% to endowment.

766
01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:52.500
The 529 committee themselves or the commission wanted to have 70% direct scholarships and 30%.

767
01:32:52.500 --> 01:32:57.000
So I rewrote that A and B and C.

768
01:32:57.000 --> 01:33:01.500
So you might see that in amendments later on.

769
01:33:01.500 --> 01:33:27.000
But that's where money is now going from for scholarships to people that did the, you know, the stuff at the mill yard with artificial limbs and doctors and nurses and so on, which is a good source of the money and it doesn't have to come out of general funds.

770
01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:30.500
So this $6 million should be saved.

771
01:33:30.500 --> 01:33:32.500
Thank you.

772
01:33:32.500 --> 01:33:34.500
Thank you very much.

773
01:33:34.500 --> 01:33:36.500
Appreciate that.

774
01:33:36.500 --> 01:33:39.500
Can we do the next one?

775
01:33:39.500 --> 01:33:41.500
Sure.

776
01:33:41.500 --> 01:33:46.500
The next one is Amy, 11 Preventative Health Block Grant.

777
01:33:46.500 --> 01:33:50.000
You're dropping a couple of permanent classifier.

778
01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.500
Are those being transferred somewhere?

779
01:33:52.500 --> 01:33:54.500
Shall we?

780
01:33:54.500 --> 01:33:57.500
Yes, they're moving into other AUs.

781
01:33:57.500 --> 01:34:06.000
One of the AUs that we looked at earlier, the 5262, is taking one of those positions.

782
01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:14.500
Contracts for program services is the primary expense, as well as grants for public assistance and relief.

783
01:34:14.500 --> 01:34:23.000
Could you just give us a good thumbnail on both of those expense items, 74 and 102?

784
01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:28.000
I don't know the contracts generally do in this area.

785
01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
Maybe Trish can.

786
01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
Sure.

787
01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
So thank you.

788
01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:38.500
This is something called the Preventative Health Block Grant.

789
01:34:38.500 --> 01:34:41.500
It is a large Thank you.

790
01:34:41.500 --> 01:34:46.000
This is something called the Preventative Health Block Grant.

791
01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:54.000
It is a large block grant, obviously, so it's flexible funding for core public health services.

792
01:34:54.000 --> 01:35:10.500
So we use these funds for our public health networks, and we also use them to plug holes to be able to provide services where we have no other funding to do that.

793
01:35:10.500 --> 01:35:16.000
So we can broadly address public health needs with these dollars.

794
01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:26.500
But primarily, we're spending a good bit of the money with public health networks to carry out local public health activity.

795
01:35:26.500 --> 01:35:34.000
And because it's a block grant, we don't necessarily have any success metrics with it.

796
01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:39.500
We just realize it's critical infrastructure and therefore it's wise money.

797
01:35:39.500 --> 01:35:45.000
Each of our contracts all have performance measures attached to them.

798
01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000
All right.

799
01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
Well, good.

800
01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:53.000
Do you have a question here, Representative Wirth?

801
01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
Thank you.

802
01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000
All right.

803
01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000
The next.

804
01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000
Representative Irv?

805
01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000
I'm not, thank you.

806
01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:09.000
Alright, the next one is 3899, which is the therapeutic cannabis program.

807
01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.500
So the therapeutic cannabis program.

808
01:36:11.500 --> 01:36:22.500
I'm personally worried about the long-term stability of our alternative treatment centers as every region around us goes to legal recreational marijuana.

809
01:36:22.500 --> 01:36:31.000
I don't know how these folks are going to compete with the black market in the future.

810
01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:34.500
This outside of this budget conversation probably.

811
01:36:34.500 --> 01:36:48.500
But do we have any thoughts on the long-term viability of the alternative treatment centers and whether or not we need to continue the therapeutic cannabis program forever?

812
01:36:48.500 --> 01:36:50.500
That's me again.

813
01:36:50.500 --> 01:36:55.000
So thank you for that question around therapeutic program.

814
01:36:55.000 --> 01:37:01.500
So I'll answer your second question first, which is the reason to continue.

815
01:37:01.500 --> 01:37:20.000
And we certainly believe that there is reason to continue so that people who access this for their therapeutic needs have access to safe and legal cannabis that they use to address any number of healthcare considerations.

816
01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:26.500
We certainly don't want to encourage anyone to be using a black market.

817
01:37:26.500 --> 01:37:32.000
A, it's illegal, and B, you don't know what you're getting.

818
01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:36.000
This is a much safer program for them.

819
01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:51.000
In terms of the economic viability of it, there are some policy measures that have gotten through the House and the Senate, and some have made progress and some haven't.

820
01:37:51.000 --> 01:38:00.500
Things about whether or not the ATCs need to be for-profit or nonprofit and move to an LLC status.

821
01:38:00.500 --> 01:38:02.500
That's one thing.

822
01:38:02.500 --> 01:38:19.500
We've also increased, we have ensured that they have access around the state so that they've created some satellite shop, which we think also increases some access and help them with their economic viability.

823
01:38:19.500 --> 01:38:30.500
Are you familiar with any requests to be able to have mobile dispensaries so that they can serve the rural clientele better?

824
01:38:30.500 --> 01:38:32.500
Sure.

825
01:38:32.500 --> 01:38:34.500
Thank you.

826
01:38:34.500 --> 01:38:39.000
So there's no legislation right now making that available.

827
01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:49.000
We would have to dig a little bit deeper into both the law and the administrative rules of this program.

828
01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:56.500
It's highly complex, but that is something that certainly could be considered in the future.

829
01:38:56.500 --> 01:39:13.000
I can tell you during the pandemic, we made administrative rule changes and waivers during the pandemic to allow things like curbside pickup so that, again, many of these folks are highly compromised.

830
01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000
They may have cancer.

831
01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.500
They may have other conditions.

832
01:39:17.500 --> 01:39:26.000
So we were able to address their needs, keeping them safe and keeping the ATC staff safe.

833
01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:35.000
That sounds like you think that maybe we did during the pandemic do mobile services to the doorstep.

834
01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000
We did not.

835
01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:44.000
so there was no cannabis van that went driving around from place to place.

836
01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:58.500
Individuals came to the ATCs and we allowed a rule waiver to allow the ATC staff to leave the premises with the product and deliver to the car curbside.

837
01:39:58.500 --> 01:40:02.500
That's a security, was a calculated security risk.

838
01:40:02.500 --> 01:40:04.500
We've had no problems.

839
01:40:04.500 --> 01:40:07.000
It's highly secure, highly camera-ed.

840
01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:10.500
Every step of that product is watched.

841
01:40:10.500 --> 01:40:15.500
And it was very successful and will likely keep it.

842
01:40:15.500 --> 01:40:21.000
In fact, some of our sites right now have built in.

843
01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:30.500
One had, originally, it was in an old bank, so they used the drive-through window, which was very successful.

844
01:40:30.500 --> 01:40:43.500
And we have a new site that's employing a new drive-through window because again it keeps the the patients safe and it keeps the staff safe.

845
01:40:43.500 --> 01:40:45.500
Okay thank you.

846
01:40:45.500 --> 01:40:48.500
Are there any other questions here?

847
01:40:48.500 --> 01:40:50.500
Representative Weiler?

848
01:40:50.500 --> 01:40:52.500
Thank you.

849
01:40:52.500 --> 01:40:59.000
I'm just looking at I know we talked about the 27th pay period.

850
01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:07.000
Is that reflected in class 10 or is that the additional fringe benefits in class 42?

851
01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:13.000
That would be in class 10 would be the extra pay period.

852
01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:16.500
So it's going up like $6 million.

853
01:41:16.500 --> 01:41:19.000
That's the 27th pay period.

854
01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:23.000
It doesn't include pay increases and so on.

855
01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:28.000
Are you looking at the totals for the entire Bureau?

856
01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:32.500
I'm looking at the page before, the class 10.

857
01:41:32.500 --> 01:41:34.500
That one there.

858
01:41:34.500 --> 01:41:38.000
So it goes from 120 to 129.

859
01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:41.000
Yeah, that's a pretty good bump.

860
01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000
So that's not this.

861
01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:53.000
So one would think if 22 was the 27th pay period, that class 10 would go down in 23, perhaps.

862
01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:59.000
Oh, I'm sorry, the extra pay period is in fiscal year 23.

863
01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:25.000
i'm sorry thank you you're welcome representative waller actually i wanted to know which year the extra pay period was thank you great minds okay um all right so my big concern about the ATCs is that they got to remain price competitive in order to be viable over the long run.

864
01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:30.000
And so, but so anyways, let's go on beyond that.

865
01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:33.500
All right, so that completes that bureau.

866
01:42:33.500 --> 01:42:39.000
So we're moving on to the Bureau for Public Health Protection.

867
01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:45.500
And the first accounting unit in that is 5390, which is food protection.

868
01:42:45.500 --> 01:42:48.500
Okay, this is a good one.

869
01:42:48.500 --> 01:42:52.000
This is one of my favorite ones.

870
01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.000
I like protected food.

871
01:42:54.000 --> 01:43:01.500
So the FDA for the federal government has the primary mission of doing food protection.

872
01:43:01.500 --> 01:43:04.500
So we have a local responsibility.

873
01:43:04.500 --> 01:43:10.000
What are we doing with these 14 people in New Hampshire?

874
01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:13.500
So, Representative Edwards, this is Lisa Morris.

875
01:43:13.500 --> 01:43:16.000
So they are food inspectors.

876
01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:21.000
They also work on ensuring the quality of our database.

877
01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:25.500
You know, they do 4,000 food inspections Thank you.

878
01:43:25.500 --> 01:43:29.500
work on ensuring the quality of our database.

879
01:43:29.500 --> 01:43:37.500
You know, they do 4,000 food inspections, or they oversee 4,000 food establishments that require inspection.

880
01:43:37.500 --> 01:43:47.000
Okay, so they're the ones going out to the restaurants and all looking at the cleanliness of the operation.

881
01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:54.500
Okay, so on line 59, there's an extra $100,000 a year for a full-time temp.

882
01:43:54.500 --> 01:44:02.500
What are we not doing that we need to be doing to bring in a temp?

883
01:44:02.500 --> 01:44:16.000
So there was an LBA audit three years ago, four years ago, just before my time that said that we did not have enough food protection workers.

884
01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:20.500
So this is to add staff to do that.

885
01:44:20.500 --> 01:44:31.500
You guys obviously maintain statistics and benchmarks of how many food, how many inspections of food inspectors should do in a year.

886
01:44:31.500 --> 01:44:33.500
Correct.

887
01:44:33.500 --> 01:44:47.000
And yeah, we have been far below that and really needed some additional staff in order to ensure the safety of our food products in New Hampshire.

888
01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:54.500
And that's why, as a result of that audit and in actuality, that was correct.

889
01:44:54.500 --> 01:44:57.500
So we were able to add.

890
01:44:57.500 --> 01:45:07.000
And then what on line zero, double 007, what is that agency income and what accounts for its growth?

891
01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:11.500
So these are fees for licensing for food establishments.

892
01:45:11.500 --> 01:45:16.000
and I Michelle Robert for licensing for food establishments.

893
01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:22.000
And Michelle Roberge, who's the Bureau Chief for Food Protection, is on.

894
01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:27.000
And Michelle, can you speak to sort of that increase?

895
01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:35.000
Did we increase fees or do we have more establishments that are actually paying those fees?

896
01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:38.000
That might just take a minute.

897
01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000
Oh, there she is.

898
01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
Okay.

899
01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000
Go ahead, Michelle.

900
01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:47.000
I see Representative Weiler and Norgren.

901
01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.000
You'll be next.

902
01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000
Yes, hi.

903
01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.000
Michelle Robich.

904
01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:57.000
I'm the Bureau Chief for Public Health Protection.

905
01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:04.000
So as Lisa noted that this program is primarily is an inspection licensing program.

906
01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.500
So there are licensing fees.

907
01:46:06.500 --> 01:46:10.500
There are four main sections within this program.

908
01:46:10.500 --> 01:46:18.500
So food protection, beverage and bottled water program, dairy, the dairy program, and the shellfish program.

909
01:46:18.500 --> 01:46:26.000
So those programs issue licenses, and so fees are required as part of that licensure.

910
01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:30.500
And so some of the agency gets income directly.

911
01:46:30.500 --> 01:46:43.000
So the beverage and bottled water program, the dairy program, and a portion of the food safety program, those fees go to a dedicated fund.

912
01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:57.000
The remainder of it, the majority of the fees collected for the food protection program, for the restaurant program, and the shellfish program go to the general fund.

913
01:46:57.000 --> 01:47:07.000
So the fees actually go back to the general fund, and then general funds are given to support the program.

914
01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.000
Right.

915
01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:16.500
So here's my general concern and I'd like maybe a written follow-up in this area.

916
01:47:16.500 --> 01:47:26.000
I'm concerned that coming out of the pandemic and the extent to which our restaurant industry has been crushed.

917
01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:34.000
Coming out of it, I'm hesitant to see the state slam restaurant industry has been crushed.

918
01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:53.000
Coming out of it, I'm hesitant to see the state slamming restaurant, and I know it isn't slamming, but from their perspective, it's slamming them with a license fee as they're trying to get back on their feet.

919
01:47:53.000 --> 01:48:07.000
So I'm just wondering if this is something we ought to look at in HB2 to give them some relief for the next couple of years to recover.

920
01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:17.000
And if this is an HB2 item, then I need more information around it so that we write it properly.

921
01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:37.500
So, Representative Edwards, we have this year during the pandemic, which we're currently in, we have this year during the pandemic, which we're currently in, we have wavered and delayed some of these licensing fees in order to help the restaurants.

922
01:48:37.500 --> 01:48:46.000
I do want to say that we rely on these fees for our sustenance for the program.

923
01:48:46.000 --> 01:49:04.000
So it's a fine line to, I totally am with you around you know trying to help them but we would have to figure out how to support the program to ensure that it stays whole.

924
01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:08.000
I am not going to shortchange food protection.

925
01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:20.000
I just want to take a look at these licensing fees because we just declared a whole lot of workers in New Hampshire non-essential.

926
01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:31.500
And now that they're trying to get back on their feet, I just, I want to make it a little easier for them.

927
01:49:31.500 --> 01:50:02.000
So I would like to look at it and I would like to figure out what we need to do to keep this part of the accounts you know sufficiently funded but thank you represent I don't know what you had your hand up first so I'll go with Representative Norgren and then have Representative Weiler back clean up Thank you.

928
01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:15.000
So tell me what the relationship is, and I don't know if it's in this food protection program, what's the relationship with our local health officials?

929
01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:22.000
I mean, most communities have a health official and what would be the relationship?

930
01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:35.000
That's a great question because this particular bureau oversees the health officer program for the state and we do have a very close relationship with them.

931
01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:48.000
We actually have one and a half staff assigned to supporting those health officers and we do have some towns that are are self-inspecting as well.

932
01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:54.500
And we provide training to them and technical assistance and support to them.

933
01:50:54.500 --> 01:51:01.000
Do you have a follow-up to that and take care of your question?

934
01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:04.500
OK, I'm going to assume it did.

935
01:51:04.500 --> 01:51:07.000
Representative Weiler, you're up, sir.

936
01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.000
Thank you.

937
01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:18.000
I was involved in that study committee as a result of that audit from a few years ago.

938
01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:33.000
And what we basically were doing was rewriting some of the laws that were declared as being kind of not able to be understood and not able to be properly.

939
01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:45.500
But one of the results of that committee, the FDA throws some money behind this, and they were saying that we don't do enough inspections.

940
01:51:45.500 --> 01:52:07.000
And so our suggestion from the committee, and I think we put it in legislation, but it got defeated by the agency, was you've got hundreds of McDonald's, hundreds of Burger Kings, hundreds of Dunkin' Donuts that get inspected regularly by the franchisor.

941
01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:18.500
And they are far more worried about that inspection than they are about the public health services because they'll just pay the fine.

942
01:52:18.500 --> 01:52:23.500
But if they lose their franchise, they're really in trouble.

943
01:52:23.500 --> 01:52:30.500
So what I suggested and the committee did was that we train those people.

944
01:52:30.500 --> 01:52:46.500
So when they do their franchise inspection, they also have a page that comes from food inspections and they can be doing that inspections as our agents and turning in a report.

945
01:52:46.500 --> 01:52:54.000
But I guess it was fearful of losing a state job that it was defeated.

946
01:52:54.000 --> 01:53:08.500
But it seemed like you could go a long way to fulfilling what the FDA is saying when we only do a third of what they recommend for inspections.

947
01:53:08.500 --> 01:53:10.500
Thank you.

948
01:53:10.500 --> 01:53:12.500
Yes.

949
01:53:12.500 --> 01:53:17.500
So, Representative Waller, so we are currently doing risk-based inspections.

950
01:53:17.500 --> 01:53:25.500
So we have a risk-based approach to how often we inspect these restaurants and food establishments.

951
01:53:25.500 --> 01:53:38.000
I don't think that we were worried about losing positions, I think we're more concerned with ensuring that food inspection is done properly and safely.

952
01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:48.000
And so we continue to take a look at that self-inspection, a trained self-inspection, but currently we're not doing that.

953
01:53:48.000 --> 01:54:09.500
But we continue to use that risk-based inspection approach, and we had to end up doing it that way as a result of the audit, but as a result of just limited capacity to do the level of food inspection that is needed.

954
01:54:09.500 --> 01:54:16.500
But luckily in the last biennium, we were able to get some additional positions.

955
01:54:16.500 --> 01:54:21.000
So to help us with our food establishment inspection.

956
01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:23.000
So thank you.

957
01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:25.000
Is Mr.

958
01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:27.000
Dumont still working there?

959
01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:29.000
No, he's been gone.

960
01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:33.500
No, he's been gone quite a few years now.

961
01:54:33.500 --> 01:54:35.500
He's in Rhode Island.

962
01:54:35.500 --> 01:54:39.000
So what happened to our federal funds?

963
01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:43.000
We went just from $15,000 to basically nothing.

964
01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:45.000
Michelle?

965
01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:47.000
I can answer that.

966
01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.000
Oh, OK.

967
01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:51.000
Yeah.

968
01:54:51.000 --> 01:55:00.000
That is, again, an oversight and a mistake that we made using our new source of funds tool.

969
01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:06.000
So we'll be putting in a budget change request to correct that.

970
01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:08.000
Okay, no problem.

971
01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:10.000
Thank you.

972
01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:12.000
All right.

973
01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:19.500
I just want to say something in general to the committee and to the attendees.

974
01:55:19.500 --> 01:55:31.500
You know, everyone from the department to the committee to the LBA staff is really just working a tremendous number of hours these days.

975
01:55:31.500 --> 01:55:47.000
Because on the 24th of March, we have to finish our work on what gets close to being a $6 billion budget for two years with federal and state money included.

976
01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:56.500
And so it isn't just the money, it's these programs affect a tremendous number of lives in New Hampshire.

977
01:55:56.500 --> 01:56:05.000
And I think we're all very sensitive to the impact that these programs have on real people.

978
01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:32.500
And so as we continue to do our work, I just would hope that there would be some level of forbearance and tolerance as we speak amongst ourselves to try to get at what we can do to make these programs as efficient, as effective, and as appropriately resourced as I can, as we can.

979
01:56:32.500 --> 01:56:44.000
So I guess that's just my PR announcement that we just give each other a break as we go through all of this.

980
01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:48.500
And so far, it seems like we have been.

981
01:56:48.500 --> 01:56:51.500
So let's do a time check.

982
01:56:51.500 --> 01:56:53.500
Mr.

983
01:56:53.500 --> 01:56:55.500
Ripple, I have 1110.

984
01:56:55.500 --> 01:57:03.500
I don't think we're going to be able to finish at this rate by, say, 1245.

985
01:57:03.500 --> 01:57:09.500
And I would like a hard start at 130 with our guests.

986
01:57:09.500 --> 01:57:16.500
So do we have a plan B for the spreadsheets we're not doing today?

987
01:57:16.500 --> 01:57:20.000
And if so, what's the plan B?

988
01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:22.000
Yep.

989
01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:30.000
Public health is still scheduled to finish up on Monday if they don't get done today.

990
01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:33.500
So you do have time left over.

991
01:57:33.500 --> 01:57:35.500
Okay.

992
01:57:35.500 --> 01:57:48.500
So I think since I've interrupted everyone's rhythm, let's take a five minute bio break and a little bit of a recess and come back, please.

993
01:57:48.500 --> 01:57:50.500
Thank you.

994
01:57:50.500 --> 01:57:52.500
Thank you.

995
01:57:52.500 --> 01:57:54.500
Thank you.

996
01:57:54.500 --> 01:57:56.500
Thank you.

997
01:57:56.500 --> 01:57:58.500
Thank you.

998
01:57:58.500 --> 01:58:06.000
Yes, I find out the quickest way to unmute yourself is to press the spacebar.

999
01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:11.500
And then when you're through talking, you know, you can't stop.

1000
01:58:11.500 --> 01:58:17.500
You don't have to worry about reaching around and finding the button.

1001
01:58:17.500 --> 01:58:19.500
That's pretty slick.

1002
01:58:19.500 --> 01:58:25.500
I'll try to remember that in my moment of panic next time.

1003
01:58:25.500 --> 01:58:29.500
I think we can get started when Mr.

1004
01:58:29.500 --> 01:58:31.500
Ripple comes back online.

1005
01:58:31.500 --> 01:58:33.500
Yep, you're still recording.

1006
01:58:33.500 --> 01:58:37.500
So if everybody's ready, you're good to go.

1007
01:58:37.500 --> 01:58:40.000
Okay, so here's my plan.

1008
01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:42.500
It's a little past 1115.

1009
01:58:42.500 --> 01:59:01.500
I'd like us to find a natural stop point in less than an hour and a half, at which point we'll take our lunch break to 1.30 where we'll have transitioned to some invited guests for this afternoon.

1010
01:59:01.500 --> 01:59:09.500
So that's how I think we'll pace it and probably have to continue around B subsequently.

1011
01:59:09.500 --> 01:59:11.500
So, all right.

1012
01:59:11.500 --> 01:59:19.500
I don't know who was talking and leading, but whoever that is, we can begin again.

1013
01:59:19.500 --> 01:59:21.500
It's me again.

1014
01:59:21.500 --> 01:59:23.500
All right, we're back.

1015
01:59:23.500 --> 01:59:28.000
I think we had finished talking about food protection.

1016
01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:32.000
So moving down to 5391 radiological health fees.

1017
01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:35.500
Okay, so there's another radiological line elsewhere.

1018
01:59:35.500 --> 01:59:54.000
So maybe somebody could just distinguish for me what the general purpose of the radiological health fees are, and then I don't remember where the other radiological activity or work was, but can we parse these out?

1019
01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:56.000
Am I wrong?

1020
01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:59.500
Is there one or two radiological items?

1021
01:59:59.500 --> 02:00:01.500
There's two.

1022
02:00:01.500 --> 02:00:12.500
One is radiological emergency preparedness and response, and the other is radiological work relative to inspections of radiological equipment across the state.

1023
02:00:12.500 --> 02:00:16.000
And this is the latter, I presume.

1024
02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:20.500
Yeah, so fees for, yes, radiological health, that's correct.

1025
02:00:20.500 --> 02:00:36.500
This is, so fees are the fees paid by entities who, I don who register or license, I don't know Michelle or Robert can say which one it is, their radiological equipment.

1026
02:00:36.500 --> 02:00:40.000
And that's used to support the program.

1027
02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:45.000
So I do have just a couple of questions here.

1028
02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:57.000
The and 61 that's in 22 and 23 of general funds that I don't know if that's another small mistake or not, but it's.

1029
02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:59.000
yeah.

1030
02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:04.000
Karen Hollweg, That is that's an error, sir, thank you.

1031
02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:08.500
John Potter, Can I ask a question on that.

1032
02:01:08.500 --> 02:01:10.500
Yes.

1033
02:01:10.500 --> 02:01:12.500
Go ahead.

1034
02:01:12.500 --> 02:01:14.500
Yes.

1035
02:01:14.500 --> 02:01:32.000
Is it safe to assume anything under $1,000 in that, that shows up in those kind of places where the other, where previous years had zero, could just, like, just put a zero in there?

1036
02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:34.500
I think it is, yeah.

1037
02:01:34.500 --> 02:01:39.000
On public health maybe, but not in other areas.

1038
02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:42.000
Well, yeah, for public health, yeah.

1039
02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:45.000
I can't speak to other areas.

1040
02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:47.000
Oh, that, okay.

1041
02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:54.500
So the issue is specifically related to public health, this program issue, whatever it was?

1042
02:01:54.500 --> 02:01:56.500
Yeah.

1043
02:01:56.500 --> 02:01:58.500
Okay.

1044
02:01:58.500 --> 02:02:15.500
Okay, but I don't know if you can just put a zero there because I'm guessing that that 161 is meant to lay in some other account somewhere and is going to be transferred.

1045
02:02:15.500 --> 02:02:17.500
Thank you.

1046
02:02:17.500 --> 02:02:28.000
there because I'm guessing that 161 is meant to lay in some other account somewhere and it's going to be transferred.

1047
02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:30.000
Exactly.

1048
02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:35.000
Yeah, so we'll submit change requests for all of it.

1049
02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:39.000
Representative Weiler, do you have a question, sir?

1050
02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:41.000
Yes, I do.

1051
02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:57.000
When the fees go up on these, which I assume the agency income is the fees for charging people that have an x-ray machine, my dentist has four of them, four operatories.

1052
02:02:57.000 --> 02:03:04.000
And he complained one year he had a huge increase in his inspection fees.

1053
02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:15.000
And he said in 20 years, it only had two inspections, but he had to mail in an inspection fee every year.

1054
02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:21.000
So it looks like we're going up every year on inspection fees.

1055
02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:23.000
Why?

1056
02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:27.500
Michelle, might you be able to answer that question?

1057
02:03:27.500 --> 02:03:31.000
So I can't speak to previous years.

1058
02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:36.000
I I know that our fees are established in rule.

1059
02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:41.500
So those go through the regulatory process and setting those fees.

1060
02:03:41.500 --> 02:03:44.000
Those are for license fees.

1061
02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:51.000
So any new pieces of equipment or we have an annual process of renewal.

1062
02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:59.000
So they are, you know, subject to submit renewal applications and pay the fee for that.

1063
02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:02.000
There is no fee for inspections.

1064
02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:07.000
Inspections are done at the frequency is required by NRC.

1065
02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:15.500
So depending on the piece of equipment, there's an inspection frequency that the program needs to meet.

1066
02:04:15.500 --> 02:04:20.000
And again, that's dependent on the type of device.

1067
02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:29.500
We also, so this program regulates machines, radiation machines, like x-ray devices and things like that, and radioactive materials.

1068
02:04:29.500 --> 02:04:37.500
So hospitals that use radioactive materials also need to have a license with us as well.

1069
02:04:37.500 --> 02:04:48.500
I guess the question was, why do you need to go up every year in the inspection fee or the registration fee?

1070
02:04:48.500 --> 02:04:55.000
I would need to verify when the last time we raised our fees.

1071
02:04:55.000 --> 02:05:00.500
I'm sorry, I don't have that data in front of me.

1072
02:05:00.500 --> 02:05:05.500
And as I said, those fees are established in rules.

1073
02:05:05.500 --> 02:05:10.500
So we would have to go through a rulemaking process.

1074
02:05:10.500 --> 02:05:26.500
So I don't have the answer for you in terms of when the last time we raised the fees were for this program, but I certainly can find that out for you.

1075
02:05:26.500 --> 02:05:32.000
I mean, it may be that there's more equipment being licensed.

1076
02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:41.000
We will find that out, but it could relate to more equipment as opposed to more higher fees.

1077
02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:47.500
And, you know, these fees are used to support the program as well.

1078
02:05:47.500 --> 02:05:51.500
But we'll find that information out for you.

1079
02:05:51.500 --> 02:06:07.000
So I'm curious as our medical equipment gets increasingly digitized and self-correcting, if the future of this is going to decline because the calibration and reporting will be automatic and digitized.

1080
02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:11.000
So is that theory actually happening in practice?

1081
02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:51.000
Are we having to go drive somewhere fewer times because we're getting the same data we need else elsewise so as i'm sorry um as i as i noted the um the inspection frequency for the equipment is is we we try to to meet the guidelines as required by nrc um so our inspectors will go out and take equipment with them to make sure that the device is not emitting higher levels of radiation than it should be.

1082
02:06:51.000 --> 02:07:02.500
And so we do a verification process to ensure, again, public health protection, that there isn't excess radiation coming off of these devices.

1083
02:07:02.500 --> 02:07:04.500
Sure.

1084
02:07:04.500 --> 02:07:08.000
Now, I'm familiar with the 1990s process.

1085
02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:17.500
I'm just curious if the technology is getting smart enough to where fewer physical visits are gonna be needed.

1086
02:07:17.500 --> 02:07:21.500
I mean, we take our direction from NRC.

1087
02:07:21.500 --> 02:07:29.500
So, you know, we can't speak to when their standards will change based upon new technology.

1088
02:07:29.500 --> 02:07:32.000
We can move on then.

1089
02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:37.000
Representative Irfty, you don't have any questions here, do you?

1090
02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:39.000
No, sir.

1091
02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:42.000
You don't have any questions here.

1092
02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:46.500
I don't think I don't see your hand up.

1093
02:07:46.500 --> 02:07:48.500
Correct.

1094
02:07:48.500 --> 02:07:50.500
Okay.

1095
02:07:50.500 --> 02:07:57.000
I'm going to go ahead and move down then to radiological emergency response.

1096
02:07:57.000 --> 02:08:03.500
When was the last time we had a radiological emergency in the state?

1097
02:08:03.500 --> 02:08:11.500
I don't know if we've ever had one, but we're prepared in case we ever do.

1098
02:08:11.500 --> 02:08:16.000
We work very closely with Homeland Security Emergency Management.

1099
02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:25.500
These funds that are here listed the other funds are Seabrook dollars that come in to support this program.

1100
02:08:25.500 --> 02:08:27.500
Thank you.

1101
02:08:27.500 --> 02:08:29.500
management.

1102
02:08:29.500 --> 02:08:39.000
These funds that are here listed, the other funds are Seabrook dollars that come in to support this program.

1103
02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:52.500
So Seabrook is required by law to, and the state is required by law to have an emergency response plan that is drilled every so many years.

1104
02:08:52.500 --> 02:09:01.000
And as As I say, we work very closely with Homeland Security and Emergency Management on this.

1105
02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:04.000
It is a full-time job plus.

1106
02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:11.000
Okay, so there's two people doing it now and it's going up to three.

1107
02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:15.000
Why do we need to add another person?

1108
02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:17.500
I can take that question.

1109
02:09:17.500 --> 02:09:28.500
The person was actually previously budgeted in $53.91 and we're moving them into this accounting unit because it's where they belong actually.

1110
02:09:28.500 --> 02:09:33.000
So there were three people already doing the program.

1111
02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:41.000
Yeah, two of these people are laboratorians who do testing, monitoring, testing on a regular basis.

1112
02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:43.000
At Seabrook or elsewhere?

1113
02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:46.000
Across the area that Seabrook covers.

1114
02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:49.000
Is that a correct statement, Michelle?

1115
02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:52.500
You can correct me if I'm wrong.

1116
02:09:52.500 --> 02:10:00.000
I'm sorry, Representative Edwards, are you asking where the two positions, the laboratory positions are?

1117
02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:09.500
No, I'm asking where do they go out and do testing, and I'm assuming it's at Seabrook, and Ms.

1118
02:10:09.500 --> 02:10:17.500
Morris added that it's in the surrounding area where prevailing winds and stuff would maybe cause.

1119
02:10:17.500 --> 02:10:21.500
But it's pretty much centered around Seabrook's output.

1120
02:10:21.500 --> 02:10:25.500
I would say for the most part, yes.

1121
02:10:25.500 --> 02:10:38.500
But there are some baseline locations to make sure that we understand kind of what the baseline levels of radiation, natural radiation are in New Hampshire.

1122
02:10:38.500 --> 02:10:46.000
But yes, there is a plethora of monitoring that's done in and around Seabrook Station.

1123
02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:50.000
And then I assume you have no vacancies.

1124
02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:53.000
Those three positions are currently filled?

1125
02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:55.000
That's correct.

1126
02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:57.000
Okay, thank you.

1127
02:10:57.000 --> 02:11:01.500
Okay, moving down to $53.99, low-level radioactive waste management.

1128
02:11:01.500 --> 02:11:03.500
Shelley, is this the...

1129
02:11:03.500 --> 02:11:06.000
Yes, I'm seeing revolving funds.

1130
02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:17.500
So this is the dedicated fund that we hope to never have to use, which is essentially having to clean up radioactive problems.

1131
02:11:17.500 --> 02:11:19.500
Is that correct?

1132
02:11:19.500 --> 02:11:22.500
So that's why there's zero expenditures.

1133
02:11:22.500 --> 02:11:27.000
We budget just a small amount as a safety.

1134
02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:30.000
Michelle, can you speak to this?

1135
02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:34.000
Is that a correct statement that Karen made?

1136
02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:38.000
Because I know we do do some removal.

1137
02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:57.500
Yes, occasionally when the department is notified of, if, you know, sometimes we find these at transfer stations, a low level radioactive waste will show up at a transfer station and it needs to be disposed of it properly.

1138
02:11:57.500 --> 02:12:06.000
And so our inspectors will go out and take possession of it and then dispose of it.

1139
02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:10.500
And sometimes these funds are used for that purpose.

1140
02:12:10.500 --> 02:12:15.000
It's pretty sparingly, but yes, it does happen sometimes.

1141
02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:21.000
The next one is 5698, which is lead of poisoning prevention fund.

1142
02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:31.500
And what I would mention here is this program had funding added in the last by NEM, if I remember correctly.

1143
02:12:31.500 --> 02:12:36.500
It may have been in the next accounting unit, though.

1144
02:12:36.500 --> 02:12:41.500
So I don't see any personnel associated with this line.

1145
02:12:41.500 --> 02:12:49.500
I believe it's in the next accounting unit and 5964 and lead prevention are the staff.

1146
02:12:49.500 --> 02:13:06.500
If I may just add, I'm sorry, that there is a part-time position that we will be, that these funds will support for the, for the lead program and you'll see that in class.

1147
02:13:06.500 --> 02:13:11.000
What kind of work will that part-time employee do?

1148
02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:16.500
This person is going to help with our environmental investigation team.

1149
02:13:16.500 --> 02:13:20.000
So they will be helping coordinate environmental.

1150
02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:25.500
This person is going to help with our environmental investigation team.

1151
02:13:25.500 --> 02:13:32.000
So they will be helping coordinate environmental inspections and just coordinating that group.

1152
02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:36.500
And as I said, this is a part-time position.

1153
02:13:36.500 --> 02:13:40.000
It's more field work than office work.

1154
02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:49.500
This position will probably be more office work, but it supports our field team, our field inspection investigation team.

1155
02:13:49.500 --> 02:13:51.500
All right.

1156
02:13:51.500 --> 02:13:57.000
And the next accounting unit is 7,964, which is lead prevention.

1157
02:13:57.000 --> 02:14:10.000
And this is where I mentioned that there were additional funds added in class 102 that would have been higher than what was actually spent there.

1158
02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:16.000
I'm sure it took some time to get the contracts in place.

1159
02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:29.500
Given that there are 12 permanent classified here, why wouldn't the temporary employee be down in this section of the budgets to keep all the humans together?

1160
02:14:29.500 --> 02:14:32.000
Shelley, can you answer that?

1161
02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:34.000
Sure.

1162
02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:46.500
The temporary position is being funded out of the money that comes into accounting unit 5698, so that's why we put that position in there.

1163
02:14:46.500 --> 02:14:59.000
Agency income that comes in and in 7964 lead prevention, it's mostly federal dollars from grants and a little bit of general funds as well.

1164
02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:01.000
Thank you.

1165
02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:11.500
in and in 79-64 lead prevention it's mostly federal dollars from grants and a little bit of general funds as well.

1166
02:15:11.500 --> 02:15:13.500
Representative Waller.

1167
02:15:13.500 --> 02:15:17.500
I had a question about the fund mix.

1168
02:15:17.500 --> 02:15:27.500
So it looks like our general funds have gone down, not much, but a little bit, a couple hundred thousand.

1169
02:15:27.500 --> 02:15:36.000
And it looks like the federal funds have gone up by almost, almost doubled actually from 2020.

1170
02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:53.500
And I wondered, is that a new program that the federal government is funding or is it just a formula and we are getting more funds from the federal government than we had previously gotten?

1171
02:15:53.500 --> 02:15:55.500
Michelle?

1172
02:15:55.500 --> 02:15:57.500
Sure.

1173
02:15:57.500 --> 02:16:05.500
So this program is supported by three different grants, one by CDC and two by EPA.

1174
02:16:05.500 --> 02:16:13.000
And again, last year, you know, we were intending to apply for a new grant.

1175
02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:18.000
And with COVID, they decided to forego the application process.

1176
02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:25.000
And we did get extra funds for that grant as well in that year.

1177
02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:32.500
But primarily these funds, you know, again, we generally apply for these every five years.

1178
02:16:32.500 --> 02:16:38.500
Shelley, I don't know if you can speak any more to the...

1179
02:16:38.500 --> 02:16:40.500
I can definitely try.

1180
02:16:40.500 --> 02:16:50.000
Something that I've found over my 10 years at public health is that the CDC-led funds seem to fluctuate.

1181
02:16:50.000 --> 02:17:03.000
So there'll be a few years where they're pumping out a lot of money to us and we're taking it in and we're running with it.

1182
02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:08.500
And then the next couple of years, they'll reduce it significantly.

1183
02:17:08.500 --> 02:17:17.500
And then we're struggling to try to cover the activities that we were doing with that extra money.

1184
02:17:17.500 --> 02:17:24.000
And then two years later, they're giving us that larger amount as well.

1185
02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:31.500
So that may be a little bit of what the fluctuation was in the past.

1186
02:17:31.500 --> 02:17:43.000
So the 1.2 we have budgeted right now is what we're anticipating based on what we've been communicated to by the federal funders.

1187
02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:45.000
Thank you.

1188
02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:47.000
Sure.

1189
02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:57.500
So I'm not certain on, I'd have to go back to the program manager and check and get back to you.

1190
02:17:57.500 --> 02:17:59.500
Thank you.

1191
02:17:59.500 --> 02:18:01.500
Sure.

1192
02:18:01.500 --> 02:18:06.500
So I'm looking at line 50, personal service temp appointee.

1193
02:18:06.500 --> 02:18:11.000
Is this, this implies another person or more hours?

1194
02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:14.000
What's going on in this line?

1195
02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:22.000
So there are two part-time positions as well in this AU, along with 12 class-10 positions.

1196
02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:26.500
Are you adding one, though, in this next budget?

1197
02:18:26.500 --> 02:18:55.000
you I'm just looking at the jump in the number and it looks like you're either adding a person or you're increasing some hours no we aren't adding and where do you see where do you see that representative edwards can you point to that yes ma'am i'm looking at line 50, personal service temp slash appointee.

1198
02:18:55.000 --> 02:19:01.500
And so in the current budget year, we're spending about $40,000 each year.

1199
02:19:01.500 --> 02:19:06.000
And in the next budget, we're spending about $68,000.

1200
02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:14.000
So going from $40,000 to $68,000 feels to me like we're adding man hours or manpower.

1201
02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:18.500
So I can say that we are gearing up.

1202
02:19:18.500 --> 02:19:26.500
So over the past, since 2019, the blood lead action level in the state is lowering.

1203
02:19:26.500 --> 02:19:34.500
And so in 2019, it went from 10 micrograms per deciliter to seven and a half.

1204
02:19:34.500 --> 02:19:40.000
And then it's going to lower again in 2021 to five.

1205
02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:46.000
And so we're anticipating an increase in workload significantly in this program.

1206
02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:57.000
So I know that we are working hard to fill any vacancies that we have in anticipation for the increase in workload.

1207
02:19:57.000 --> 02:20:00.000
Okay, so that addresses that question.

1208
02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:05.500
So of the 12, how many of those are vacant currently?

1209
02:20:05.500 --> 02:20:07.500
You think?

1210
02:20:07.500 --> 02:20:13.500
Of the 12, we have one vacancy that we are recruiting for.

1211
02:20:13.500 --> 02:20:15.500
Thank you.

1212
02:20:15.500 --> 02:20:18.000
that we are recruiting for.

1213
02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:22.000
What kind of person are you hiring here?

1214
02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:26.500
And by that, I mean academic or experiential background.

1215
02:20:26.500 --> 02:20:40.000
So this position that we're recruiting for is a public health nurse to help with our nurse case management for children who have elevated blood lead levels.

1216
02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:43.000
Are there any other questions here?

1217
02:20:43.000 --> 02:20:45.000
I don't see any.

1218
02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:49.000
Moving down to 79.36 is climate change adaptation.

1219
02:20:49.000 --> 02:20:52.000
I have a question about that.

1220
02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:54.000
Go ahead.

1221
02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:56.000
What is it?

1222
02:20:56.000 --> 02:21:00.500
Michelle, do you want to talk about climate change?

1223
02:21:00.500 --> 02:21:02.500
Sure.

1224
02:21:02.500 --> 02:21:12.000
So the climate and health program in New Hampshire, this is a federal grant from CDC supports this program.

1225
02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:16.000
This program is really just one staff person.

1226
02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:32.500
And you'll see in class 10 that this there looks like there was an increase, but this position was paid in a different accounting unit and is transferred over to this accounting unit.

1227
02:21:32.500 --> 02:21:35.500
I'm actually asking about the money.

1228
02:21:35.500 --> 02:21:37.500
What do they do?

1229
02:21:37.500 --> 02:21:39.500
Oh, sorry.

1230
02:21:39.500 --> 02:21:48.500
So basically they take federal funds and invest them into straightforward public health actions to improve community health.

1231
02:21:48.500 --> 02:22:00.500
We use CDC's what's called the BRACE format, which is really just building greater workforce capacity to address climate change via engagement and training.

1232
02:22:00.500 --> 02:22:04.000
I definitely want to hear the verbiage.

1233
02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:11.000
I want to know exactly what do you mean when you say those words.

1234
02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:17.000
Give an example of what something you're doing that's affecting climate change.

1235
02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:19.000
Sure.

1236
02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:25.000
So the whole main purpose of the program is really about adaptation.

1237
02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:30.000
It's helping communities adapt to the issues around climate change.

1238
02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:32.000
Michelle, yeah, I'll try.

1239
02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:37.500
So, for example, with warmer climates, we're getting more Lyme disease.

1240
02:22:37.500 --> 02:22:49.000
So we may provide grants to regions to be able to do training for children around Lyme disease prevention or tick prevention services.

1241
02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:58.500
For other regions, we may provide interventions or funding for them to deal with older adults and heat issues.

1242
02:22:58.500 --> 02:23:05.500
So those are just two examples of the way that we use those dollars.

1243
02:23:05.500 --> 02:23:10.500
It's really very public health focused around warmer climate issues.

1244
02:23:10.500 --> 02:23:14.500
Representative Weiler, do you have a question, sir?

1245
02:23:14.500 --> 02:23:18.500
I just don't think it's a worthwhile program.

1246
02:23:18.500 --> 02:23:27.500
There's nothing we can do about climate change and wasting a lot of money trying to do something.

1247
02:23:27.500 --> 02:23:35.000
Representative Weiler, this isn't about what we do has nothing to do with adapting climate.

1248
02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:42.500
It really has to do with helping people to ensure their health as climate warms.

1249
02:23:42.500 --> 02:23:52.000
You're right, there's nothing, we're not debating whether or not climate, you know, we're doing anything about climate change.

1250
02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:58.500
It's really about those impacts on individual health that we're trying to impact.

1251
02:23:58.500 --> 02:24:08.000
Well, I think every summer we have people that get heat stroke and get adverse reactions to the heat.

1252
02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:14.000
And I don't think we need to label that as something different.

1253
02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:17.000
It's something you've always done anyway.

1254
02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:30.500
If I could, I would suggest that the scope of our committee is to look at the financial aspect and not the policy that's federal and state.

1255
02:24:30.500 --> 02:24:43.500
I think from a financial policy perspective, given these are federal funds, I would just ask, why is this a permanent classified position and not temporary?

1256
02:24:43.500 --> 02:24:49.000
Because we can fund it as long as there's federal money.

1257
02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:57.500
Shelly, can you speak to why positions may go from temporary to permanent or Karen, either way.

1258
02:24:57.500 --> 02:25:09.500
If a position goes from temporary to permanent it's because it's been converted, which does require approval during the governor's phase of the budget.

1259
02:25:09.500 --> 02:25:15.000
So this may have happened, you know, quite a while ago.

1260
02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:21.500
Last, this current budget, there were zero people, and now there's one projected.

1261
02:25:21.500 --> 02:25:33.500
So just looking at the paper, it looks like this is a new position, and we've decided to make it permanent to begin with.

1262
02:25:33.500 --> 02:25:36.500
And that's what I'm looking at.

1263
02:25:36.500 --> 02:25:47.500
This position, we first got the climate grant, like 2012 perhaps, have a position for it, and we've had the position ongoing.

1264
02:25:47.500 --> 02:26:01.500
The last biennium, the grant was the scope or the activities of the grant were such that they wanted to put most of the money out into contracts.

1265
02:26:01.500 --> 02:26:12.000
And the position was then moved over into the preventive health block grant to continue to help that with that work.

1266
02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:18.000
In this new biennium, 22-23, the grant is now affording the position.

1267
02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:22.000
So we are moving it back in here.

1268
02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:24.000
OK.

1269
02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:39.000
So I just would note that it appears that the major change in the next budget is that less money is actually going for the programs, a significant amount less.

1270
02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:46.000
And from what I'm looking at, we went from zero to one permanent employee.

1271
02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:58.000
And so even though it's federal money, it just doesn't look to me like, it doesn't feel to me like managing this very well.

1272
02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:06.500
That's the wrong way to just be spending money on permanent employees and less money on programs.

1273
02:27:06.500 --> 02:27:12.000
I don't know that we're doing anybody any good that way.

1274
02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:16.500
And then that's, there's not a question in there.

1275
02:27:16.500 --> 02:27:18.500
That's just a comment.

1276
02:27:18.500 --> 02:27:21.000
Representative Weiler, sir, I apologize.

1277
02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:31.500
I think I may have cut you off and you still, do you have something more you'd like to say, sir?

1278
02:27:31.500 --> 02:27:33.500
No problem.

1279
02:27:33.500 --> 02:27:35.500
All right.

1280
02:27:35.500 --> 02:27:37.500
So let's continue.

1281
02:27:37.500 --> 02:27:39.500
Okay.

1282
02:27:39.500 --> 02:27:44.500
The next accounting unit is 7426, which is EPH tracking.

1283
02:27:44.500 --> 02:27:47.500
This is environmental public health tracking.

1284
02:27:47.500 --> 02:27:49.500
Thank you.

1285
02:27:49.500 --> 02:27:51.500
Good thing.

1286
02:27:51.500 --> 02:27:55.000
Which public health thing are we tracking?

1287
02:27:55.000 --> 02:27:57.000
Environmental contamination, for example.

1288
02:27:57.000 --> 02:28:00.500
We track that relative to health impacts.

1289
02:28:00.500 --> 02:28:03.000
Lead is covered somewhere else.

1290
02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:08.500
And so I'm just curious what other environmental factors we're monitoring.

1291
02:28:08.500 --> 02:28:57.000
So this particular program works with all the other programs across the division and with Department of Environmental Services to be able to track the variety of environmental contaminants such as lead as an example, PFAS as an example, to be able to track the variety of environmental contaminants such as lead as an example, PFAS as an example, to be able to sort of figure out where in this arsenic, another example, to figure out where in the state we have high levels so we can target interventions, where we have the resources to do so.

1292
02:28:57.000 --> 02:29:00.500
So that's part of what they do.

1293
02:29:00.500 --> 02:29:03.500
So we've got federal funding only.

1294
02:29:03.500 --> 02:29:11.500
We've got permanent classified positions and we're growing the permanent classified position from two to three.

1295
02:29:11.500 --> 02:29:18.000
And so similar conversations we just had, why are we adding a person?

1296
02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:20.500
What will that person do?

1297
02:29:20.500 --> 02:29:26.500
And why aren't these temporary positions since they're reliant on federal funding?

1298
02:29:26.500 --> 02:29:32.500
Michelle, can you speak to, are we adding positions in this program?

1299
02:29:32.500 --> 02:29:34.500
looks like we are.

1300
02:29:34.500 --> 02:29:37.000
So we moved a position.

1301
02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:42.000
We moved an existing position into this program to support.

1302
02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:50.500
We received, well, the Department of Environmental Services received a new federal grant called the Appletree Grant.

1303
02:29:50.500 --> 02:29:54.000
And so we're a partner with them.

1304
02:29:54.000 --> 02:30:14.000
And so this position, which was in, I believe it was in the block grant, was moved to this accounting unit because its primary function will be to, you know, work on the Apple Tree program within this accounting unit.

1305
02:30:14.000 --> 02:30:21.000
And I can give you more information on the Apple Tree if you'd like.

1306
02:30:21.000 --> 02:31:06.000
That's where you'll see some of the differences in this account are the are the funding that we received as part of that apple tree program yeah i think we're just finding a couple of areas here where we have fundamentally different management philosophy between the department and my own personal view and that is if something's 100% funded by federal money and we can't control how much they give us, that it doesn't do our people any good to put them into permanent positions that may actually be temporary.

1307
02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:12.500
And it just seems to me like we're not using the system properly.

1308
02:31:12.500 --> 02:31:20.000
But we can take that offline, I guess, because it's not worth belaboring in public.

1309
02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:26.500
We can go on to the next one if there are no questions.

1310
02:31:26.500 --> 02:31:28.500
Okay.

1311
02:31:28.500 --> 02:31:33.500
That, I believe, concludes the Bureau of Public Health Protection.

1312
02:31:33.500 --> 02:31:36.000
Thank you, Michelle, very much.

1313
02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:45.000
Moving on to the Bureau of Community and Health Services, I believe is what the CLM is there.

1314
02:31:45.000 --> 02:31:49.000
Accounting unit 0836, an elusive three-digit accounting number.

1315
02:31:49.000 --> 02:31:53.500
It's like seeing license plates that start with zeros.

1316
02:31:53.500 --> 02:31:56.500
0836 is pregnancy risk monitoring system.

1317
02:31:56.500 --> 02:31:58.500
Okay.

1318
02:31:58.500 --> 02:32:02.000
What is a pregnancy risk monitoring service?

1319
02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:07.000
I just, I know what each of the words means.

1320
02:32:07.000 --> 02:32:12.500
I just am not sure what it means all put together.

1321
02:32:12.500 --> 02:32:15.500
I can take this one, Lisa.

1322
02:32:15.500 --> 02:32:21.500
So we call this PRAMS because public health loves a good acronym.

1323
02:32:21.500 --> 02:32:35.000
And this is a survey that we received federal funding, CDC funding to do to better understand the pregnancy and birth experience of women in New Hampshire.

1324
02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:48.000
It is a survey that is done nationally, so we can benchmark those health outcomes and those experiences with the experiences of others in other states.

1325
02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:55.500
So this is places where we understand if women are drinking alcohol or while pregnant.

1326
02:32:55.500 --> 02:32:59.000
We also understand sort of birth weight.

1327
02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:11.000
We also can put together information around that to do the data analysis to better understand how we can support that cohort of women.

1328
02:33:11.000 --> 02:33:13.500
Okay, thank you for that.

1329
02:33:13.500 --> 02:33:29.500
And so just I guess this is going to be lumped into the same bucket of conversation around the use of permanent classified positions to fund positions that are 100% federally funded.

1330
02:33:29.500 --> 02:33:35.500
So I think we just have a misalignment of our manpower resources.

1331
02:33:35.500 --> 02:33:39.500
And then I'm looking at what we do.

1332
02:33:39.500 --> 02:33:49.500
And then I noticed that there's on line 50, we have, it looks like we're increasing man hours or manpower.

1333
02:33:49.500 --> 02:33:54.500
What are we doing in the next budget on 50?

1334
02:33:54.500 --> 02:33:56.500
Cy, we have Dr.

1335
02:33:56.500 --> 02:34:04.000
Cy Charella who is available to answer questions relative to the community population health bureau.

1336
02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:07.500
Cy, can you respond to that question?

1337
02:34:07.500 --> 02:34:11.500
Can you let somebody let Cy Torella in?

1338
02:34:11.500 --> 02:34:13.500
Kevin did.

1339
02:34:13.500 --> 02:34:15.500
I think she's in.

1340
02:34:15.500 --> 02:34:17.500
Oh, great.

1341
02:34:17.500 --> 02:34:19.500
Cy?

1342
02:34:19.500 --> 02:34:21.500
Maybe she isn't.

1343
02:34:21.500 --> 02:34:23.500
Hold on one second.

1344
02:34:23.500 --> 02:34:25.500
I'm here.

1345
02:34:25.500 --> 02:34:27.500
Can you hear me?

1346
02:34:27.500 --> 02:34:29.500
Yes.

1347
02:34:29.500 --> 02:34:31.500
Thank you.

1348
02:34:31.500 --> 02:34:33.500
Dr.

1349
02:34:33.500 --> 02:34:36.500
Torella, thank you for joining us.

1350
02:34:36.500 --> 02:34:39.000
You must be very busy.

1351
02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:42.000
Thank you so much, Representative Edwards.

1352
02:34:42.000 --> 02:34:48.500
I know the question about the personal service, the line 050 class line.

1353
02:34:48.500 --> 02:35:00.500
We also have a part-time position in this AU, and that part-time position actually helps with interning the moms when we provide the survey.

1354
02:35:00.500 --> 02:35:03.000
So that is that person.

1355
02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:15.000
And actually, because we are getting some additional funds to support COVID-related surveys, so those are the additional dollars we are adding to that.

1356
02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:23.000
That explains the increase in federal funds because you're going to get a COVID plus up?

1357
02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:25.000
Yes.

1358
02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:32.500
So the extra manpower is going to be used then to do that extra work.

1359
02:35:32.500 --> 02:35:37.500
That makes 100% sense, even to me as a non-physician.

1360
02:35:37.500 --> 02:35:39.500
Okay.

1361
02:35:39.500 --> 02:35:51.500
And then I don't know if you want to speak to the federal funds issue, funding a permanent classified position versus a temporary position.

1362
02:35:51.500 --> 02:35:54.000
I can jump in there.

1363
02:35:54.000 --> 02:36:06.000
So there are many places throughout the department, not just in public health, where there are permanent positions that are associated with federal funds.

1364
02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:16.500
We do try to limit when we do that, when it is federal funding that is less guaranteed, if you will.

1365
02:36:16.500 --> 02:36:32.000
So when it comes to block grants that have been in place for 20 years, we don't have a lot of concern around that, you know, sort of just going away.

1366
02:36:32.000 --> 02:36:40.500
But some of the smaller, more infrequent grants, we try not to associate permanent positions with them.

1367
02:36:40.500 --> 02:36:59.500
What I would say is that just like a temporary position, if the funding goes away for a position, the result is the same at the end, which is that the person doesn't have a position any longer.

1368
02:36:59.500 --> 02:37:17.000
You would have to lay that person off or have them apply to a different position in the department, but the end result is generally the same when it comes to funding no longer existing.

1369
02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:22.000
So you're teaching me a very specific thing, I think.

1370
02:37:22.000 --> 02:37:35.000
And I'm laboring under the assumption that a person holding a temporary position has a different layoff procedure than somebody in a permanent classified position would.

1371
02:37:35.000 --> 02:37:49.000
That the permanent classified would kind of, I'm not using the right words, but would have a higher level of protection or process than a temporary person would.

1372
02:37:49.000 --> 02:37:54.500
So a temporary position does have an end date on it.

1373
02:37:54.500 --> 02:38:07.000
So that is one difference that if the temporary position ends, that ends the position, where a permanent position does not have an end date.

1374
02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:11.500
So that is certainly one of the larger differences.

1375
02:38:11.500 --> 02:38:31.500
There are certainly layoff procedures when it comes to permanent positions, and I do not oversee HR, so I don't want to pretend to know those rules or the union rules associated with when we can lay off an employee.

1376
02:38:31.500 --> 02:38:40.500
But if the funding no longer exists, we have to level set our budget to adjust for that.

1377
02:38:40.500 --> 02:38:53.000
And so just to be clear for the attendees that are listening in, I fully support the idea of having a pregnancy risk monitoring system.

1378
02:38:53.000 --> 02:39:00.000
Good, I can move on to accounting in 1844, which is teen pregnancy prevention.

1379
02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:05.000
No, I just, I need to make a comment here.

1380
02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:07.000
Okay.

1381
02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:21.000
So, I support having a pregnancy risk monitoring system, but I also want to be careful that we don't bind future legislatures to decisions that we make today.

1382
02:39:21.000 --> 02:39:28.500
And that's why I've been talking about whether these positions should be permanent or temporary.

1383
02:39:28.500 --> 02:39:37.000
And it should not be considered to be disparaging towards the value and benefit of the program.

1384
02:39:37.000 --> 02:39:43.500
It's simply a financial conversation around the right way to structure an organization.

1385
02:39:43.500 --> 02:39:45.500
It's a good program.

1386
02:39:45.500 --> 02:39:47.500
I support it.

1387
02:39:47.500 --> 02:39:55.500
I just want to make sure that we have the right administrative systems around the DHHS.

1388
02:39:55.500 --> 02:39:58.000
So we can go on.

1389
02:39:58.000 --> 02:40:00.000
Okay.

1390
02:40:00.000 --> 02:40:17.000
What I would mention is if there was a decision to eliminate this permanent position and make it a temporary position, I do believe that the person would have to reapply for the position.

1391
02:40:17.000 --> 02:40:29.000
I would have to talk to personnel, but I don't think we can just move them to a different position, just so you're aware.

1392
02:40:29.000 --> 02:40:33.500
Okay, the next accounting is is 1840-14 Pregnancy Prevention.

1393
02:40:33.500 --> 02:40:45.500
And this is one of those accounting units which we've talked about before where we're moving the expenditure from class line 102 to 74.

1394
02:40:45.500 --> 02:40:48.000
Are there any questions here?

1395
02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:54.000
Okay, the next accounting unit is 2207, which is WIC food rebates.

1396
02:40:54.000 --> 02:40:59.500
So this is all, I'm assuming this is all federal, WIC.

1397
02:40:59.500 --> 02:41:02.500
I'm behind you on the slide.

1398
02:41:02.500 --> 02:41:05.000
It is all federal, yes.

1399
02:41:05.000 --> 02:41:07.000
Is that correct?

1400
02:41:07.000 --> 02:41:09.000
It's private local.

1401
02:41:09.000 --> 02:41:11.000
Does that mean federal?

1402
02:41:11.000 --> 02:41:13.000
Oh, okay.

1403
02:41:13.000 --> 02:41:15.000
This is food rebates.

1404
02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:17.000
Okay.

1405
02:41:17.000 --> 02:41:19.000
I apologize.

1406
02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:21.000
Dr.

1407
02:41:21.000 --> 02:41:24.000
Turella, would you like to respond?

1408
02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:26.000
Yeah, sure.

1409
02:41:26.000 --> 02:41:35.500
The food rebates is basically we have, we get food rebates from food companies, especially the baby food formula.

1410
02:41:35.500 --> 02:41:53.000
We receive the revenue from the winning contractor, so they provide a rebate on all our standard milk and soya infant formula, and this revenue is actually used to, again, support our additional WIC families.

1411
02:41:53.000 --> 02:42:03.500
It's required that all these rebates ones should go to the food costs, not for any programming or any other things.

1412
02:42:03.500 --> 02:42:11.000
So from our actual, in FY20, we're assuming another, you know, jump to 22, 23.

1413
02:42:11.000 --> 02:42:15.500
What would account for that extra flow of income?

1414
02:42:15.500 --> 02:42:21.000
Are we charging or are we asking for a higher rebate?

1415
02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:25.500
Are we expecting more baby food to be sold?

1416
02:42:25.500 --> 02:42:27.500
What's going on there?

1417
02:42:27.500 --> 02:42:39.500
We're expecting again with the COVID impact with the food insecurity, we are expecting that there will be an increased use or increased need.

1418
02:42:39.500 --> 02:42:43.000
So that's where we have additional funds.

1419
02:42:43.000 --> 02:42:52.000
And there are very specific provisions in statute that don't allow us to spend more than we receive.

1420
02:42:52.000 --> 02:43:02.500
So if we, I'm guessing that in 2020, that was also budgeted at 4 million and we only received 2.7 million.

1421
02:43:02.500 --> 02:43:05.500
So we only spent 2.7 million.

1422
02:43:05.500 --> 02:43:07.500
All right, thank you.

1423
02:43:07.500 --> 02:43:10.500
We can go to the next.

1424
02:43:10.500 --> 02:43:15.000
Moving down to a 2215 CDC oral health grant.

1425
02:43:15.000 --> 02:43:27.500
This is a 10017,000 $17,000 $17,000 $17,000 $17,000 $17,000 $17,000 $17,000 $17,000 $17,000 $17,000 $17,000 $ Okay, so what is the nature of these contracts?

1426
02:43:27.500 --> 02:43:30.000
What are we contracting for?

1427
02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:35.000
So basically this one, thank you for the question, Representative.

1428
02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:44.000
Our focus is especially providing oral health programs for the school-based clinics as well as our community-based clinics.

1429
02:43:44.000 --> 02:43:56.000
So school-based clinics is more focused on for all the low-income children as well as for the community-based, again, low-income adults we focus on.

1430
02:43:56.000 --> 02:44:05.000
So our idea is to, our focus is to reduce the dental caries and improve the oral health.

1431
02:44:05.000 --> 02:44:12.000
So that's where our, most of our contracts go in to support those agencies.

1432
02:44:12.000 --> 02:44:14.000
Right.

1433
02:44:14.000 --> 02:44:18.000
So, so we're doing adult care in here.

1434
02:44:18.000 --> 02:44:20.000
It sounds like, yes.

1435
02:44:20.000 --> 02:44:26.500
Yes, for the, some of our community-based agencies do support our low-income adults.

1436
02:44:26.500 --> 02:44:46.500
So, just so you know what I'm thinking is that if we do start up the Medicaid dental program, I'm just curious how this program and the Medicaid dental program would work collaboratively to create a community-based solution that's evidence-based.

1437
02:44:46.500 --> 02:44:52.000
We have been working with our Medicaid program on that topic.

1438
02:44:52.000 --> 02:44:57.000
We have partnership in understanding how we address those things.

1439
02:44:57.000 --> 02:45:04.500
And we are working towards understanding what the population needs are and all those things.

1440
02:45:04.500 --> 02:45:06.500
All right.

1441
02:45:06.500 --> 02:45:08.500
Very good.

1442
02:45:08.500 --> 02:45:11.500
Are there any other questions here?

1443
02:45:11.500 --> 02:45:13.500
Thank you.

1444
02:45:13.500 --> 02:45:15.500
Okay.

1445
02:45:15.500 --> 02:45:18.500
Next is 4526 MCH data linkage.

1446
02:45:18.500 --> 02:45:21.000
That's maternal and child health.

1447
02:45:21.000 --> 02:45:23.000
Thank you.

1448
02:45:23.000 --> 02:45:25.000
Okay.

1449
02:45:25.000 --> 02:45:31.000
The next one is 4527, which is oral health capacity, rural health.

1450
02:45:31.000 --> 02:45:33.000
Okay.

1451
02:45:33.000 --> 02:45:42.500
So I assume this is doing something to make sure that we have dentists out in the rural areas.

1452
02:45:42.500 --> 02:45:45.500
Is that what this is doing?

1453
02:45:45.500 --> 02:45:51.000
Yes, this is a combination of a couple of funding sources.

1454
02:45:51.000 --> 02:45:58.500
We have federal funds from the HRSA, as well as some of our general funds.

1455
02:45:58.500 --> 02:46:13.000
Our focus is very much on improving the capacity, the overall health capacity, as well as providing some training to our dental providers on some of the opioid prescription.

1456
02:46:13.000 --> 02:46:18.500
Those are some of the things that we are working towards.

1457
02:46:18.500 --> 02:46:21.500
So how do we do that?

1458
02:46:21.500 --> 02:46:32.000
Do we target higher reimbursements with this fund so that dentists have a greater financial incentive to serve in that area?

1459
02:46:32.000 --> 02:46:36.000
Or do we do direct payments for locations?

1460
02:46:36.000 --> 02:46:42.000
Or how do we decide which dentists get it and which don't?

1461
02:46:42.000 --> 02:46:46.000
We actually look at health service shortage areas.

1462
02:46:46.000 --> 02:46:50.000
So we call it dental professional shortage areas.

1463
02:46:50.000 --> 02:46:56.500
So we look at those areas within our state to target those services.

1464
02:46:56.500 --> 02:47:03.500
So if they're in a specific geographic location, then we pay them a supplement.

1465
02:47:03.500 --> 02:47:10.000
And if they're not in that geographic location, they don't get the supplement.

1466
02:47:10.000 --> 02:47:13.500
Is that basically how that program works?

1467
02:47:13.500 --> 02:47:19.500
We haven't, I mean, this is not like a whole statewide program.

1468
02:47:19.500 --> 02:47:23.000
It's very specific communities kind of thing.

1469
02:47:23.000 --> 02:47:28.500
So that's where we focus in those dental professional shortage areas.

1470
02:47:28.500 --> 02:47:41.000
We focus to support some of their, as I mentioned before, those community-based and school-based services, we based on the base for those areas too.

1471
02:47:41.000 --> 02:47:49.500
So they get a percentage of time of the dental provider is provided to do this contract.

1472
02:47:49.500 --> 02:47:51.500
Dr.

1473
02:47:51.500 --> 02:47:57.000
Torella, are these providers often connected to a community health center?

1474
02:47:57.000 --> 02:48:02.000
Yes, some of them are connected to community health centers.

1475
02:48:02.000 --> 02:48:07.500
Some of them are connected to the school, school health services.

1476
02:48:07.500 --> 02:48:11.500
So that's how we provide those support services.

1477
02:48:11.500 --> 02:48:15.000
Representative Irf, do you have a question?

1478
02:48:15.000 --> 02:48:17.000
Just a quick one.

1479
02:48:17.000 --> 02:48:29.000
Any reason that the federal funds went away this year and they bounced, whether they were there before and they come back next year?

1480
02:48:29.000 --> 02:48:32.500
I'm sorry, I didn't understand your question.

1481
02:48:32.500 --> 02:48:34.500
Sorry, you're presenting there.

1482
02:48:34.500 --> 02:48:41.000
So the FY21 adjusted authorized budget, unless I'm being in the wrong place.

1483
02:48:41.000 --> 02:48:43.500
Which one are we on?

1484
02:48:43.500 --> 02:48:46.500
It doesn't have any federal funds.

1485
02:48:46.500 --> 02:48:49.500
Shelly, can you speak to that?

1486
02:48:49.500 --> 02:48:51.500
I can, yes.

1487
02:48:51.500 --> 02:49:00.000
Before, well, currently in 2021, this grant was actually mixed in with the other accounting unit, 2215.

1488
02:49:00.000 --> 02:49:06.000
And so we're pulling it out and putting it back over here.

1489
02:49:06.000 --> 02:49:20.500
Previous, this accounting unit, even though it was called rural health, I don't know why it got budgeted incorrectly historically, but it only had general funds tied to it.

1490
02:49:20.500 --> 02:49:24.500
Although it shows general funds for 20 actual.

1491
02:49:24.500 --> 02:49:26.500
Yes, we have.

1492
02:49:26.500 --> 02:49:28.500
I mean, federal funds.

1493
02:49:28.500 --> 02:49:30.500
Yes, we, yes.

1494
02:49:30.500 --> 02:49:33.000
So federal, no federal, federal.

1495
02:49:33.000 --> 02:49:42.000
So, Shelly, are we going to fiscal committee to adjust the federal funds for fiscal year 21 there?

1496
02:49:42.000 --> 02:49:45.000
I'd have to check on that.

1497
02:49:45.000 --> 02:49:49.500
It's not in my memory bank at the moment.

1498
02:49:49.500 --> 02:49:51.500
I'm sorry.

1499
02:49:51.500 --> 02:49:53.500
No problem.

1500
02:49:53.500 --> 02:50:22.000
So I'm just looking at an efficiency angle here i i i still don't know which dentists get money and which don't on what basis but but to shift it a little bit it it looks like uh 20 percent of the money spent in this program goes to a state employee and 80% to actual providers.

1501
02:50:22.000 --> 02:50:31.000
And so my question is, does that, does that, is, is that perceived to be an efficient program?

1502
02:50:31.000 --> 02:50:33.000
We think so.

1503
02:50:33.000 --> 02:50:36.000
We think it's an efficient program.

1504
02:50:36.000 --> 02:50:51.500
And, you know, these providers are in communities where there are low income individuals and partners that that that is a part of their mission is to serve low income individuals.

1505
02:50:51.500 --> 02:51:00.500
So you need somebody to manage these these various contracts that go along with this pot of money.

1506
02:51:00.500 --> 02:51:35.000
And if I can just add a little bit here to your point that you've made several times around is this effective use of funds, we can say that certainly those school-based dental clinics in those rural areas, we can show over time that where we've invested in that school-based dental clinic, the number of caries in that population, the number of cavities in those kids has dramatically declined.

1507
02:51:35.000 --> 02:51:41.500
It's one of the great places where we can see investment goes up.

1508
02:51:41.500 --> 02:51:46.000
When the investment goes up, the caries go down.

1509
02:51:46.000 --> 02:51:52.500
And we know that that saves money all around and improves health outcomes.

1510
02:51:52.500 --> 02:51:54.500
That's outstanding.

1511
02:51:54.500 --> 02:51:56.500
Thank you.

1512
02:51:56.500 --> 02:52:03.000
Representative Edwards, I just know the time because you were concerned about that.

1513
02:52:03.000 --> 02:52:05.000
I am.

1514
02:52:05.000 --> 02:52:09.000
Am I asking too many questions, Representative Irv?

1515
02:52:09.000 --> 02:52:11.000
No, no, no.

1516
02:52:11.000 --> 02:52:13.000
It's after 12.

1517
02:52:13.000 --> 02:52:16.000
I thought you had mentioned 12.

1518
02:52:16.000 --> 02:52:18.000
That's all.

1519
02:52:18.000 --> 02:52:25.500
No, I had mentioned going between 1230 and 1245 is what I meant to say.

1520
02:52:25.500 --> 02:52:29.000
That would give us our 45 minutes.

1521
02:52:29.000 --> 02:52:31.000
Sorry.

1522
02:52:31.000 --> 02:52:33.000
That's all right.

1523
02:52:33.000 --> 02:52:36.000
Are there any other questions here?

1524
02:52:36.000 --> 02:52:38.000
Okay.

1525
02:52:38.000 --> 02:52:40.000
Thank you.

1526
02:52:40.000 --> 02:52:42.000
We could go on.

1527
02:52:42.000 --> 02:52:44.000
All right.

1528
02:52:44.000 --> 02:52:48.000
12 to 10 people working in this area.

1529
02:52:48.000 --> 02:52:58.000
Is that just a transfer of positions or is that because of the workload is going down or what's happening?

1530
02:52:58.000 --> 02:53:04.500
We move positions into other accounting units to better align with the programs.

1531
02:53:04.500 --> 02:53:10.000
Generally, what kind of skill set do the remaining 10 have?

1532
02:53:10.000 --> 02:53:13.500
Are they nurse practitioners of some kind?

1533
02:53:13.500 --> 02:53:15.500
Or what are they?

1534
02:53:15.500 --> 02:53:18.500
Go ahead, Sai, go ahead, Sai.

1535
02:53:18.500 --> 02:53:20.500
Go ahead, Lisa.

1536
02:53:20.500 --> 02:53:22.500
No, you go.

1537
02:53:22.500 --> 02:53:26.500
I was going to ask you to go.

1538
02:53:26.500 --> 02:53:28.500
Go ahead.

1539
02:53:28.500 --> 02:53:32.000
Thank you for the question, Representative Edwards.

1540
02:53:32.000 --> 02:53:34.500
Many of them are nurses.

1541
02:53:34.500 --> 02:53:40.000
Some of them are public health specialists focused on specific programs.

1542
02:53:40.000 --> 02:53:49.000
So we have a combination of clinically trained as well as public health trained staff in these positions.

1543
02:53:49.000 --> 02:54:00.000
And just by way of background, this particular accounting unit 5190 was historically where all maternal and child health programs were located.

1544
02:54:00.000 --> 02:54:26.000
And over the course of many bienniums now we have tried to appropriately put when we've had federal programs put them in their own accounting units so it's a it's it has scaled down in some capacities it's scaled up and down but we're trying to more appropriately align the budgets now.

1545
02:54:26.000 --> 02:54:29.500
Representative Walner, you have your hand up.

1546
02:54:29.500 --> 02:54:32.000
Yes, thank you, Chairman Edwards.

1547
02:54:32.000 --> 02:54:46.000
So in 2021, I see under contracts you were authorized for over $5 million in contracts, which was almost $2 million more than in 2020, which you spent.

1548
02:54:46.000 --> 02:54:54.000
I wondered what was it that you were proposing to do in 2021 that didn't happen?

1549
02:54:54.000 --> 02:54:56.000
Dr.

1550
02:54:56.000 --> 02:54:58.000
Torella?

1551
02:54:58.000 --> 02:55:07.000
I think some of that too before she speaks is moving some of that into class line 74.

1552
02:55:07.000 --> 02:55:12.000
There's about 850,000 that's been moved to 74 as well.

1553
02:55:12.000 --> 02:55:14.000
Okay.

1554
02:55:14.000 --> 02:55:16.000
Okay.

1555
02:55:16.000 --> 02:55:18.000
Go ahead.

1556
02:55:18.000 --> 02:55:25.000
Is there anything that you did request in 2021 that is not in 2022?

1557
02:55:25.000 --> 02:55:27.000
No.

1558
02:55:27.000 --> 02:55:30.500
What we have requested is still there.

1559
02:55:30.500 --> 02:55:39.000
Only the contract line has, as Karen mentioned, it's just got adjusted between class 102 and 074.

1560
02:55:39.000 --> 02:55:49.000
In this area, is the budget that the governor is proposing meet with what the department requested of the governor?

1561
02:55:49.000 --> 02:55:51.500
No, not in this EU.

1562
02:55:51.500 --> 02:55:59.500
No, I think the question is, so this is not where our prioritized need is identified.

1563
02:55:59.500 --> 02:56:01.500
Is that correct?

1564
02:56:01.500 --> 02:56:04.000
It's a different accounting unit.

1565
02:56:04.000 --> 02:56:06.000
Yes, that's right.

1566
02:56:06.000 --> 02:56:09.500
So yes, it is what we requested.

1567
02:56:09.500 --> 02:56:12.000
It is what you requested.

1568
02:56:12.000 --> 02:56:14.000
Thank you.

1569
02:56:14.000 --> 02:56:21.500
On the line item you just pointed out, 74 grants for public assistance and relief.

1570
02:56:21.500 --> 02:56:23.500
Yes.

1571
02:56:23.500 --> 02:56:25.500
What is this?

1572
02:56:25.500 --> 02:56:31.500
It seems like this is a complimentary program that supplements other programs.

1573
02:56:31.500 --> 02:56:35.500
Are you sure it's not a redundant program?

1574
02:56:35.500 --> 02:56:41.500
So can you talk about what the focus of this program is?

1575
02:56:41.500 --> 02:56:43.500
Sure.

1576
02:56:43.500 --> 02:56:50.500
I think probably Karen or Shelly can talk about what the 074 line is.

1577
02:56:50.500 --> 02:56:58.500
But overall, the MCH, the block, we call it block grant, MCH block grant, Title V.

1578
02:56:58.500 --> 02:57:11.500
It's a key source of supporting and promoting improving health and well-being of moms and children, basically, and also children with special needs and their families.

1579
02:57:11.500 --> 02:57:36.000
And it actually supports our infrastructure for almost our 15 community health centers, also supports some of our injury prevention work through our contact with the Injury Prevention Center, as well as some of our injury prevention activities around, for example, the Brain Injury Association, the Traumatic Brain Injury.

1580
02:57:36.000 --> 02:57:39.000
Those are some overview big items.

1581
02:57:39.000 --> 02:57:46.000
Our primary care contact specifically focuses on low-income population and enabling services for them.

1582
02:57:46.000 --> 02:58:05.500
So this includes supporting some of their community navigation or clinical navigation programs, supporting some of their behavioral health needs, as well as supporting them for their language, because some of them have a different need in the language.

1583
02:58:05.500 --> 02:58:13.000
So those are some overview of what services we provide to our MCH block network.

1584
02:58:13.000 --> 02:58:15.000
All right.

1585
02:58:15.000 --> 02:58:17.500
So you mentioned translation services.

1586
02:58:17.500 --> 02:58:23.000
I know that in the refugee area we have translation services.

1587
02:58:23.000 --> 02:58:31.000
So I'm curious if we've got a complimentary program at that level or is it redundant?

1588
02:58:31.000 --> 02:58:36.000
It's probably not a huge part of this spend though.

1589
02:58:36.000 --> 02:58:45.500
No, it's not a huge part of spend, but the language translation is more for the community health centers.

1590
02:58:45.500 --> 02:58:50.500
So it supports some of their services in that area.

1591
02:58:50.500 --> 02:59:00.000
I think it's a complimentary in many ways, but this is very much focused at the clinical system level.

1592
02:59:00.000 --> 02:59:03.000
It oftentimes is a gap-filling service.

1593
02:59:03.000 --> 02:59:15.000
Again, with our federally qualified health centers, although we've made tremendous strides with Medicaid, especially for children and adults, we still have uninsured individuals.

1594
02:59:15.000 --> 02:59:23.000
And so sometimes it can fill some of those things like translation for those uninsured individuals.

1595
02:59:23.000 --> 02:59:25.500
Are there any other questions?

1596
02:59:25.500 --> 02:59:29.000
I'm ready to go to the next.

1597
02:59:29.000 --> 02:59:31.000
Okay.

1598
02:59:31.000 --> 02:59:33.500
5240 is newborn screening revolving.

1599
02:59:33.500 --> 02:59:48.500
Karen, just to give you a heads up, in about 15 minutes, I'm going to ask you for your best estimate for how much time is needed to complete this.

1600
02:59:48.500 --> 03:00:01.000
So before we break huddle today, I'm just going to be curious how much more time we're going to need when we do phase B.

1601
03:00:01.000 --> 03:00:03.000
Okay.

1602
03:00:03.000 --> 03:00:08.500
I will think about it and be prepared for your question.

1603
03:00:08.500 --> 03:00:10.500
Newborn screening revolving fund.

1604
03:00:10.500 --> 03:00:14.500
Where is the money coming from to Revolve?

1605
03:00:14.500 --> 03:00:18.500
That's a very good, interesting question, Representative Edwards.

1606
03:00:18.500 --> 03:00:22.000
This is actually, it's a revolving fund.

1607
03:00:22.000 --> 03:00:34.000
It's funded by filter paper fees, and those are actually paid by our hospitals and our healthcare providers as well as our birthing centers.

1608
03:00:34.000 --> 03:00:41.500
So that's, the filter paper is basically, that's how we actually test for the newborn.

1609
03:00:41.500 --> 03:00:52.000
We take a prick of their feet to get the blood and that blood is tested for almost 37 birth conditions.

1610
03:00:52.000 --> 03:01:00.000
So to understand what's happening on, like if they have any kind of specific metabolic disorders.

1611
03:01:00.000 --> 03:01:03.000
And that information comes to us.

1612
03:01:03.000 --> 03:01:09.000
And based on that, we follow with the pediatric providers and others.

1613
03:01:09.000 --> 03:01:14.000
So the blood goes on to the filter papers, correct?

1614
03:01:14.000 --> 03:01:19.000
So this is what HB 600 is intended to influence?

1615
03:01:19.000 --> 03:01:21.000
Yes, that's right.

1616
03:01:21.000 --> 03:01:31.000
Okay, so if we pass HB 600, if it were to pass, what is the impact on this line item?

1617
03:01:31.000 --> 03:01:37.500
Will the source of the money just change or will this line diminish?

1618
03:01:37.500 --> 03:01:44.000
Or what is the impact in this area should that bill get passed?

1619
03:01:44.000 --> 03:01:50.500
If that bill gets passed, we don't see an impact on our program.

1620
03:01:50.500 --> 03:01:59.500
But on the behind the scenes, the hospitals, how they actually bill for the filter paper would change.

1621
03:01:59.500 --> 03:02:11.500
So they would be able to get more, they would be able to get the rates on the filter paper, specifically from insurance providers.

1622
03:02:11.500 --> 03:02:14.000
So I'm a simple guy.

1623
03:02:14.000 --> 03:02:31.000
So what I think I just heard you say is the insurance companies will pay more, the hospitals will pay less and therefore be a little better off, and the state remains the same.

1624
03:02:31.000 --> 03:02:33.000
Yes.

1625
03:02:33.000 --> 03:02:35.000
That's in shock, yes.

1626
03:02:35.000 --> 03:02:37.000
Our hope is that.

1627
03:02:37.000 --> 03:02:39.000
Thank you.

1628
03:02:39.000 --> 03:02:42.000
Okay, any other questions on 5240?

1629
03:02:42.000 --> 03:02:44.000
I don't see any.

1630
03:02:44.000 --> 03:02:48.000
Moving down to 5260 WIC Supplemental Nutrition Program.

1631
03:02:48.000 --> 03:02:51.000
So this is the program itself.

1632
03:02:51.000 --> 03:02:56.000
This obviously has a large amount being transferred to 74.

1633
03:02:56.000 --> 03:03:04.000
Do we think we're going to spend that $10 million in federal money for FY21 adjusted?

1634
03:03:04.000 --> 03:03:08.000
Or are we not going to spend that?

1635
03:03:08.000 --> 03:03:13.000
I'm talking about the federal funds line for WIC supplemental.

1636
03:03:13.000 --> 03:03:19.000
Yeah, anticipating that we will be able to spend all those dollars.

1637
03:03:19.000 --> 03:03:25.500
Again, with the food insecurity and COVID, we are getting more federal funds.

1638
03:03:25.500 --> 03:03:36.000
but we also see there will be an anticipated need going forward after we come down from the fact of COVID.

1639
03:03:36.000 --> 03:03:41.500
So there's going to be more follow-up that's going to happen.

1640
03:03:41.500 --> 03:03:47.000
So we expect that we'll be able to spend those dollars.

1641
03:03:47.000 --> 03:04:00.000
I think Chris Santanello spoke to earlier that there's been an increase in food stamps and so that has been affecting our other programs like WIC.

1642
03:04:00.000 --> 03:04:08.000
So once that increase is no longer available, we probably will see an increase here again.

1643
03:04:08.000 --> 03:04:10.000
Okay.

1644
03:04:10.000 --> 03:04:15.500
The next accounting unit is 5330, which is family planning program.

1645
03:04:15.500 --> 03:04:24.000
And I'm going to go ahead and preempt a couple of questions that I know exist here.

1646
03:04:24.000 --> 03:04:30.500
So, Representative Walner, the governor's budget here does not reflect the agency request.

1647
03:04:30.500 --> 03:04:42.000
The reason for that is during the governor's phase, an adjustment was made to reduce the general funds and increase the federal funds.

1648
03:04:42.000 --> 03:04:47.000
Now, the increase in federal funds should not have happened.

1649
03:04:47.000 --> 03:04:57.000
So let me go through what the intent was and why I, quite frankly, was the one that advised that.

1650
03:04:57.000 --> 03:05:01.000
increase in federal funds should not have happened.

1651
03:05:01.000 --> 03:05:12.500
So let me go through what the intent was and why I, quite frankly, was the one that advised that made that mistake.

1652
03:05:12.500 --> 03:05:20.000
So during the 2021 biennium, there was a change to the Title X rules, laws.

1653
03:05:20.000 --> 03:05:39.000
I wouldn't invite program to jump in if I say any of this incorrectly, but there was a change to the laws that reduced the funds that went from the federal government directly to some of our providers.

1654
03:05:39.000 --> 03:05:57.000
So during the legislative phase of preparing for the 2021 budget, the House committee, your committee, added more general funds to this budget to essentially supplant the federal funds that those agencies were no longer receiving.

1655
03:05:57.000 --> 03:06:09.500
So those federal funds did not flow through the department previously, and those general funds were intended to supplant something that didn't flow through us.

1656
03:06:09.500 --> 03:06:34.000
It is anticipated, although not yet official or changed, that the, or this is the governor's office assumption, that the Title X rules will change again to go back to where they were, previous bienniums, and that those federal funds will again flow directly to some of our providers.

1657
03:06:34.000 --> 03:06:40.000
And so that the general fund supplanting will no longer be necessary.

1658
03:06:40.000 --> 03:06:46.500
And so that is the change that was made in the governor's phase.

1659
03:06:46.500 --> 03:06:54.500
As I mentioned, I incorrectly told them that it would be federal funds flowing through us.

1660
03:06:54.500 --> 03:06:58.500
Those federal funds would not flow through us.

1661
03:06:58.500 --> 03:07:07.000
So I would be submitting a change request to reduce the federal funds in this accounting unit.

1662
03:07:07.000 --> 03:07:12.000
But the general funds are also lower for that reason.

1663
03:07:12.000 --> 03:07:16.500
Is there anything I missed there, Lisa or Trish?

1664
03:07:16.500 --> 03:07:19.500
And explaining- You did very well.

1665
03:07:19.500 --> 03:07:22.000
Okay, once in a while.

1666
03:07:22.000 --> 03:08:01.000
while under wall or you'll have a follow-up when they're ready i'm i'm good i think we're good for questions okay i may have to i may have to play that over again in my head for a little while because it was quite a um so what I'm wondering, so you're going to come back to us, Karen, do I understand this right that you are coming back to us with a reduced federal funding level here?

1667
03:08:01.000 --> 03:08:25.500
Yes, because the federal funds should be more in line with where they are in fiscal year 21 in that $1.2 million range, not $2.1 million, because those federal funds that the general funds were supplanting in 2021 are federal funds that would flow directly from the federal government.

1668
03:08:25.500 --> 03:08:29.000
So they would not go through DHHS.

1669
03:08:29.000 --> 03:08:41.500
So we're dependent for all of this to happen on something that's going to happen in Washington to change the way they fund family planning.

1670
03:08:41.500 --> 03:08:53.000
do we have a date when all of this is going to actually happen or is this just out in the future someplace?

1671
03:08:53.000 --> 03:09:03.500
Representative Walner, we have been told it's expected within between six months and a year that that change will take place.

1672
03:09:03.500 --> 03:09:11.500
The fiscal year for the federal government starts one October, which could leave a three-month gap.

1673
03:09:11.500 --> 03:09:13.500
I think.

1674
03:09:13.500 --> 03:09:17.000
Six months to a year from now?

1675
03:09:17.000 --> 03:09:19.000
Yes.

1676
03:09:19.000 --> 03:09:21.000
Or...

1677
03:09:21.000 --> 03:09:26.500
Okay, so the $811,000 on that line will be considerably short.

1678
03:09:26.500 --> 03:09:42.500
it looks like there had been it looked like they were trying I thought that what had happened is we were trying to bring in more federal funds to replace general funds.

1679
03:09:42.500 --> 03:09:48.500
But that doesn't seem that doesn't seem what it is at all.

1680
03:09:48.500 --> 03:09:53.000
Doesn't seem like there will be more general funds.

1681
03:09:53.000 --> 03:09:57.500
So the 811 is considerably short from previous budgets.

1682
03:09:57.500 --> 03:10:02.500
So in previous budgets, like 2020, it was $1.4 million.

1683
03:10:02.500 --> 03:10:06.500
So that's several hundred thousands of dollars less.

1684
03:10:06.500 --> 03:10:15.000
how do we figure this so that we have the right amount of funding on these lines?

1685
03:10:15.000 --> 03:10:24.500
So are you asking how do we determine the amount of general funds that should supplant the federal funds?

1686
03:10:24.500 --> 03:10:26.500
Yes.

1687
03:10:26.500 --> 03:10:33.000
Yeah, I think that does depend on when that rule change does happen.

1688
03:10:33.000 --> 03:10:41.500
So we could probably provide you like the amount for a six month cost if that's helpful.

1689
03:10:41.500 --> 03:10:51.000
Or a three month cost or a year cost, but whatever the request is we can provide the amount.

1690
03:10:51.000 --> 03:11:13.500
I think you probably should give it to us in three months so we know know what a three month wedge would be because I'm anticipating that we might need a bridge from July one our fiscal year to October one the federal fiscal year.

1691
03:11:13.500 --> 03:11:15.500
We can provide that.

1692
03:11:15.500 --> 03:11:17.500
Okay, for you.

1693
03:11:17.500 --> 03:11:44.000
Representative Walner, you still have the floor, maam go ahead the floor um so is there a federal match requirement of the states for these funds yes and that is what that 811 000 in general funds is there is the state match but what was it matching was it matching 2 million?

1694
03:11:44.000 --> 03:11:48.500
It's matching the, no, it's matching around 1.2 million.

1695
03:11:48.500 --> 03:11:50.500
Okay.

1696
03:11:50.500 --> 03:11:52.500
Okay.

1697
03:11:52.500 --> 03:11:59.500
I look forward to seeing the additional materials you're going to provide to us.

1698
03:11:59.500 --> 03:12:01.500
Thank you.

1699
03:12:01.500 --> 03:12:23.500
So you know what might be helpful, Representative Walner, if you would consider writing down exactly what you're thinking in this area and if you want to send it directly to the department so that they're clear on what your questions and concerns are.

1700
03:12:23.500 --> 03:12:25.500
Yeah.

1701
03:12:25.500 --> 03:12:33.500
I don't think the whole committee needs to be involved in that dialogue at this point.

1702
03:12:33.500 --> 03:12:35.500
Thank you.

1703
03:12:35.500 --> 03:12:37.500
I will do that.

1704
03:12:37.500 --> 03:12:41.000
I will send it directly to Karen.

1705
03:12:41.000 --> 03:12:43.000
Thank you.

1706
03:12:43.000 --> 03:12:49.000
And then, so we've got a couple of representatives ready to go.

1707
03:12:49.000 --> 03:12:54.000
I just wanted to clarify something I thought I heard.

1708
03:12:54.000 --> 03:13:08.000
It sounded to me like some of these federal funds in the future had all been expected to come through DHHS, but that assumption is no longer accurate.

1709
03:13:08.000 --> 03:13:23.000
So my clarification question is, is that because some amount of the money we were expecting to come to DHHS might flow directly to health providers and bypass the state?

1710
03:13:23.000 --> 03:13:28.000
No, we were never expecting it to come through DHHS.

1711
03:13:28.000 --> 03:13:31.500
Karen Rounds misunderstood and screwed it up.

1712
03:13:31.500 --> 03:13:35.000
Quite frankly, that's really all it was.

1713
03:13:35.000 --> 03:13:43.000
I misunderstood how the program worked and the federal funds have never come through the department.

1714
03:13:43.000 --> 03:13:55.000
The federal funds that we have been supplanting with general funds in 2021 have never come through the department and are never anticipated to.

1715
03:13:55.000 --> 03:13:58.500
So it was a massive screw up.

1716
03:13:58.500 --> 03:14:00.500
Totally massive screw up.

1717
03:14:00.500 --> 03:14:04.500
Yeah, I have those sometimes regularly, sometimes not.

1718
03:14:04.500 --> 03:14:06.500
You never know.

1719
03:14:06.500 --> 03:14:08.500
Yeah.

1720
03:14:08.500 --> 03:14:10.500
Yep.

1721
03:14:10.500 --> 03:14:14.000
So that was all mine to own.

1722
03:14:14.000 --> 03:14:16.000
Okay.

1723
03:14:16.000 --> 03:14:18.000
So Representative Rogers.

1724
03:14:18.000 --> 03:14:26.000
Do we know, are the providers going to be able to hang on for three months?

1725
03:14:26.000 --> 03:14:44.000
and what of population is not going to be served with health care during this time if they don't, if they're going from in excess of $2 million or $3.4 million that they got to 800,000.

1726
03:14:44.000 --> 03:14:57.000
And if it goes three months is one question you said up to a year, what's the danger of any of these providers closing their doors?

1727
03:14:57.000 --> 03:15:03.500
And do we know how many people are gonna be going without healthcare?

1728
03:15:03.500 --> 03:15:16.000
I remember from the budget two years ago that some of these providers are the only providers of healthcare to certain amounts of the population.

1729
03:15:16.000 --> 03:15:18.000
I mean, if...

1730
03:15:18.000 --> 03:15:30.500
member from the budget two years ago that some of these providers are the only providers of health care to certain amounts of the population.

1731
03:15:30.500 --> 03:15:46.500
I mean, if we don't have the general funds to support those providers while we're waiting for that rule change, then, you know, we'll have to figure out how to use those.

1732
03:15:46.500 --> 03:15:50.000
I'm not sure what we will do.

1733
03:15:50.000 --> 03:15:58.000
Was there a request made for a larger amount of general funds from the governor's office?

1734
03:15:58.000 --> 03:16:03.000
Yes, the agency budget had those general funds in it.

1735
03:16:03.000 --> 03:16:10.500
Okay, and that's part of the information I presume you'll be getting to Representative Walner.

1736
03:16:10.500 --> 03:16:20.500
To clarify what you said, Chair, it sounded like you wanted part of the information though for the whole committee.

1737
03:16:20.500 --> 03:16:25.500
You're just saying that some of them were in-depth information?

1738
03:16:25.500 --> 03:16:34.000
I'm saying Representative Waller has a deeper set of questions than what we need for the committee.

1739
03:16:34.000 --> 03:17:00.000
What I think the committee need for information here is, as I'm keeping mental track, is that we need to, I guess I still need to understand what the wedge would be to get us from July 1 to October 1, assuming that the federal funds are going to pick up again.

1740
03:17:00.000 --> 03:17:02.000
But now, Ms.

1741
03:17:02.000 --> 03:17:10.500
Rounds, I got to admit I'm thoroughly confused because there have been federal funds in the past.

1742
03:17:10.500 --> 03:17:12.500
Where did they go?

1743
03:17:12.500 --> 03:17:18.000
And, you know, and where do we expect them to come?

1744
03:17:18.000 --> 03:17:20.000
They went somewhere.

1745
03:17:20.000 --> 03:17:37.500
So right now, the majority of the family planning providers are not, some of the family planning providers are not able to participate in the Title X program, which is what these federal funds are.

1746
03:17:37.500 --> 03:17:43.500
So they have been receiving general funds instead to continue their programs.

1747
03:17:43.500 --> 03:18:00.000
So the federal funds are used to support the state staff and the services on the state side, but we are also putting out RFP for those Title 10 funds as we speak.

1748
03:18:00.000 --> 03:18:04.000
But they have to be accounted for somewhere.

1749
03:18:04.000 --> 03:18:07.000
And I thought I heard Ms.

1750
03:18:07.000 --> 03:18:42.500
Brown say that the accounting for them on this line item 000 federal funds is not as accurate as she wants it to be correct this 2.1 million dollar number is too high it should be closer to this 1.2 of fiscal year 21 you're assuming 1.2 more on maintenance of the federal status quo and not a projection of them increasing the reimbursement because of the change in Title X.

1751
03:18:42.500 --> 03:18:44.500
Correct.

1752
03:18:44.500 --> 03:18:53.000
The state won't receive any increase in its federal funding because of the change in Title X.

1753
03:18:53.000 --> 03:18:56.500
If they change it back, we would.

1754
03:18:56.500 --> 03:18:58.500
No.

1755
03:18:58.500 --> 03:19:00.500
No.

1756
03:19:00.500 --> 03:19:07.500
Some of our providers would receive additional federal funds directly from the federal government.

1757
03:19:07.500 --> 03:19:12.000
Oh, see, I explicitly try to ask that question.

1758
03:19:12.000 --> 03:19:25.500
If any of this money that's going to be increased bypasses the state and goes directly to the providers, when I asked that, I was told no.

1759
03:19:25.500 --> 03:19:30.000
No, we contract with these providers for those dollars.

1760
03:19:30.000 --> 03:19:34.500
So we have the dollars, we contract with providers.

1761
03:19:34.500 --> 03:19:44.500
And then there are other Title 10 funds the department is not involved with that go directly to the federal.

1762
03:19:44.500 --> 03:19:54.000
When we do the contract, the money goes straight from the federal government to the provider bypassing the state?

1763
03:19:54.000 --> 03:20:00.500
No, we don't have any involvement in those funds, in those federal funds.

1764
03:20:00.500 --> 03:20:03.000
We don't contract for them.

1765
03:20:03.000 --> 03:20:08.500
We don't tell the agencies what they can do with them.

1766
03:20:08.500 --> 03:20:12.000
That's between them and the federal government.

1767
03:20:12.000 --> 03:20:22.500
So there are providers in New Hampshire that are expecting to get an increase in federal funds in the coming years.

1768
03:20:22.500 --> 03:20:25.500
Potentially, if the rule changes again.

1769
03:20:25.500 --> 03:20:27.500
If the rule changes.

1770
03:20:27.500 --> 03:20:29.500
All right.

1771
03:20:29.500 --> 03:20:31.500
I think I understand.

1772
03:20:31.500 --> 03:20:34.500
I'm a little slow, but okay.

1773
03:20:34.500 --> 03:20:38.500
Representative Rogers, you actually have the floor still.

1774
03:20:38.500 --> 03:20:40.500
Go ahead.

1775
03:20:40.500 --> 03:20:43.500
I just asked one last follow-up.

1776
03:20:43.500 --> 03:20:52.000
Could you tell me what the original agency request was for the state general funding on this?

1777
03:20:52.000 --> 03:20:55.000
Shelley, do you have that, Andy?

1778
03:20:55.000 --> 03:21:00.000
It would be the $811,000 plus $1.6 million in general.

1779
03:21:00.000 --> 03:21:02.000
Plus $1 million?

1780
03:21:02.000 --> 03:21:04.000
$1.6 million.

1781
03:21:04.000 --> 03:21:06.000
$1.6 million.

1782
03:21:06.000 --> 03:21:08.500
Okay, okay, I was wondering.

1783
03:21:08.500 --> 03:21:10.500
Plus the 811, okay.

1784
03:21:10.500 --> 03:21:16.500
And that was what the original request went to the governor with.

1785
03:21:16.500 --> 03:21:19.000
Okay, thank you very much.

1786
03:21:19.000 --> 03:21:21.000
That's it.

1787
03:21:21.000 --> 03:21:25.500
Do you have any other follow-ups for Representative Rogers?

1788
03:21:25.500 --> 03:21:27.500
No, thank you, Mr.

1789
03:21:27.500 --> 03:21:29.500
Chairman.

1790
03:21:29.500 --> 03:21:32.000
Thank you, call my name.

1791
03:21:32.000 --> 03:21:36.000
It's really hard to hear you sometimes, Jess.

1792
03:21:36.000 --> 03:21:38.500
Oh, I'm sorry, Representative Irf.

1793
03:21:38.500 --> 03:21:40.500
Thank you.

1794
03:21:40.500 --> 03:21:42.500
I'm fading.

1795
03:21:42.500 --> 03:21:46.000
I'm going to need a sandwich soon.

1796
03:21:46.000 --> 03:22:02.000
Karen, can I get a list of all of the providers in the current biennium that I'm contracted with, and the total funds, and then a breakdown of general and federal funds?

1797
03:22:02.000 --> 03:22:09.500
Yes, actually, I did provide that to the LBA already, I think, for the chair.

1798
03:22:09.500 --> 03:22:12.500
So they should have that information.

1799
03:22:12.500 --> 03:22:15.000
I will make a note.

1800
03:22:15.000 --> 03:22:18.500
I think I have that, Representative Irf.

1801
03:22:18.500 --> 03:22:21.000
I'll forward it to you.

1802
03:22:21.000 --> 03:22:27.500
Okay, so that's separate from the list of things on the website, Kevin?

1803
03:22:27.500 --> 03:22:29.500
It is, yes.

1804
03:22:29.500 --> 03:22:36.000
Okay, so that's separate from the list of things on the website, Kevin?

1805
03:22:36.000 --> 03:22:38.000
It is, yes.

1806
03:22:38.000 --> 03:22:40.000
Okay, thank you.

1807
03:22:40.000 --> 03:22:42.000
So, as long as...

1808
03:22:42.000 --> 03:22:44.000
Go ahead.

1809
03:22:44.000 --> 03:22:54.000
The only reason I asked the question earlier about what you were looking for for the committee is just so...

1810
03:22:54.000 --> 03:23:04.000
So when Jonah's list comes to me, I make sure that we're providing the right information for the whole committee.

1811
03:23:04.000 --> 03:23:06.000
I appreciate that.

1812
03:23:06.000 --> 03:23:23.500
And I'm also attempting to simultaneously be sensitive to the idea, the potential, that Representative Walner has questions that she would like direct answers to and not share necessarily at this point with the committee.

1813
03:23:23.500 --> 03:23:31.000
I don't know if that's true or not, but I just allow for the possibility.

1814
03:23:31.000 --> 03:23:34.000
So OK, I have a question.

1815
03:23:34.000 --> 03:23:44.500
In FY19, which you're probably not prepared to answer, what was the general fund level for this activity code in FY19?

1816
03:23:44.500 --> 03:23:46.500
I'm looking to Shelly.

1817
03:23:46.500 --> 03:23:52.000
It looks like she might be looking that up for you.

1818
03:23:52.000 --> 03:24:01.500
I would say it's around the $800,000 mark because our match is close to $800,000 for our federal dollars.

1819
03:24:01.500 --> 03:24:10.500
Could you verify that and share that with us and put it on Jonah's list of questions, please?

1820
03:24:10.500 --> 03:24:12.500
Sure.

1821
03:24:12.500 --> 03:24:14.500
Representative Norgren?

1822
03:24:14.500 --> 03:24:16.500
Thank you Mr.

1823
03:24:16.500 --> 03:24:18.500
Chair.

1824
03:24:18.500 --> 03:24:29.500
I'm concerned if we have the department communicating with only one or two members of the committee in whatever requests they have.

1825
03:24:29.500 --> 03:24:59.000
Could you please make sure we all receive the same information so so yes but no representative nordgren i i i don't know if representative walner wants to ask questions that she is interested in sharing with the committee at this point in time so i'll just let her speak to that do Do you want to do that?

1826
03:24:59.000 --> 03:25:08.000
Or I'm allowing, I'm trying to create a channel for you to have some privacy in your communication.

1827
03:25:08.000 --> 03:25:16.000
No, any questions that I have, I would want the whole committee to have the answers.

1828
03:25:16.000 --> 03:25:24.000
I'm not going to be, there's no information here that I wouldn't want everyone to have.

1829
03:25:24.000 --> 03:25:31.000
So I think actually I'm getting most of my questions answered at this point.

1830
03:25:31.000 --> 03:25:33.000
Thank you.

1831
03:25:33.000 --> 03:25:40.000
Okay, so in that case, you know, make sure you send them to Mr.

1832
03:25:40.000 --> 03:25:42.500
Ripple and then he'll coordinate.

1833
03:25:42.500 --> 03:25:44.500
Okay.

1834
03:25:44.500 --> 03:25:46.500
All right.

1835
03:25:46.500 --> 03:25:55.500
I thought you might have had a special need there that I was hoping to satisfy with you.

1836
03:25:55.500 --> 03:25:57.500
Mr.

1837
03:25:57.500 --> 03:26:07.500
Chair, there have been other instances where other members of the committee have said they requested information sent to them.

1838
03:26:07.500 --> 03:26:10.500
Can we please make sure Mr.

1839
03:26:10.500 --> 03:26:17.000
Ripple gets copies of that so we can all see the same information.

1840
03:26:17.000 --> 03:26:19.000
I think so.

1841
03:26:19.000 --> 03:26:27.000
I believe I've asked once or twice for information to help me with some special projects.

1842
03:26:27.000 --> 03:26:38.500
And then I did that directly and have not shared the results, mostly because I didn't think it would interest anyone but me.

1843
03:26:38.500 --> 03:26:50.000
But if that's what you're referring to, I can go back through my email and figure out what I might have asked for.

1844
03:26:50.000 --> 03:26:53.000
Is that what you're talking about?

1845
03:26:53.000 --> 03:27:05.000
Yeah, well, I think just going forward, as we start getting down and making decisions, I think we just all need the same information.

1846
03:27:05.000 --> 03:27:07.000
That's fine.

1847
03:27:07.000 --> 03:27:09.000
Thank you.

1848
03:27:09.000 --> 03:27:11.000
Okay, very good.

1849
03:27:11.000 --> 03:27:13.500
Are there any other questions?

1850
03:27:13.500 --> 03:27:18.500
So we've really spent a lot of time on this.

1851
03:27:18.500 --> 03:27:20.500
It's an important topic.

1852
03:27:20.500 --> 03:27:29.000
I think this is as good a time as any to go ahead and break for lunch.

1853
03:27:29.000 --> 03:27:31.000
So Ms.

1854
03:27:31.000 --> 03:27:34.500
Rounds, now's the time for the question.

1855
03:27:34.500 --> 03:27:46.000
Based on what we have to go and based on what we've done so far, what do you think our time estimate is?

1856
03:27:46.000 --> 03:27:54.500
So based on conferring with Shelly, I think, or Rochelle, that we're probably less than 90 minutes.

1857
03:27:54.500 --> 03:27:58.500
So we were on page like Thank you.

1858
03:27:58.500 --> 03:28:06.500
Based on conferring with Shelly, I think, or Rochelle, that we're probably less than 90 minutes.

1859
03:28:06.500 --> 03:28:13.500
So we were on page like 1045 or so, and it goes to 1097.

1860
03:28:13.500 --> 03:28:21.000
So I think about an hour and a half to finish out the accounting units.

1861
03:28:21.000 --> 03:28:23.000
Mr.

1862
03:28:23.000 --> 03:28:29.500
Riple, remind me when we're going to do the phase B of this.

1863
03:28:29.500 --> 03:28:33.500
You have public health scheduled for Monday morning.

1864
03:28:33.500 --> 03:28:38.000
So join us on Monday morning from the department.

1865
03:28:38.000 --> 03:28:40.000
Yes.

1866
03:28:40.000 --> 03:28:42.000
Okay.

1867
03:28:42.000 --> 03:28:45.500
I'm seeing Trish nod her head yes.

1868
03:28:45.500 --> 03:29:18.000
I know it was scheduled on the calendar, so I believe that they all had the time held um could it be 9 30 i know some mondays you have an another conflict um i i i figured out how to work through the conflict so if it's on the house calendar for 9 30 9 30 it is i'll be there great All right.

1869
03:29:18.000 --> 03:29:20.000
Well, Dr.

1870
03:29:20.000 --> 03:29:23.000
Turella, thank you for joining us.

1871
03:29:23.000 --> 03:29:35.500
I really am uncomfortable bringing a physician into this level of detail on finances, but thank you for the answers you provided to us today.

1872
03:29:35.500 --> 03:29:39.000
I'll be joining back on March 15th.

1873
03:29:39.000 --> 03:29:42.000
Oh, it's that exciting to you.

1874
03:29:42.000 --> 03:29:44.000
Good.

1875
03:29:44.000 --> 03:29:46.000
Very exciting.

1876
03:29:46.000 --> 03:29:48.000
All right.

1877
03:29:48.000 --> 03:29:57.000
OK, well, if you could put us on recess and stop recording till 1.30, that'd be great, Kevin.

1878
03:29:57.000 --> 03:29:59.000
OK.

1879
03:29:59.000 --> 03:30:05.000
Give it a couple of minutes since we have three representatives away.

1880
03:30:05.000 --> 03:30:07.000
Two representatives.

1881
03:30:07.000 --> 03:30:09.500
Except I'm not seeing Sharon.

1882
03:30:09.500 --> 03:30:11.500
Is Sharon out there?

1883
03:30:11.500 --> 03:30:13.500
Did she log off?

1884
03:30:13.500 --> 03:30:20.500
Because I would think I'd see her if she just turned off her video.

1885
03:30:20.500 --> 03:30:24.000
Yeah, it looks like she logged off.

1886
03:30:24.000 --> 03:30:29.500
Okay, so you have your you've got the recording turned on.

1887
03:30:29.500 --> 03:30:31.500
It's now 1.31.

1888
03:30:31.500 --> 03:30:34.500
We just finished our lunch recess.

1889
03:30:34.500 --> 03:30:39.000
And we have a quorum of Division III back.

1890
03:30:39.000 --> 03:30:43.000
Our first, okay, so what are we doing?

1891
03:30:43.000 --> 03:31:08.500
Over the course of the next hour and a half or so, the committee members have been encouraged to invite people in to talk on very specific subjects related to our decisions to help us make our decisions for funding the Department of Health and Human Services or the Veterans Home.

1892
03:31:08.500 --> 03:31:16.500
And this is another way in which we're trying to encourage public input into our process.

1893
03:31:16.500 --> 03:31:28.500
Normally, in a typical year without a pandemic, we would be having these in a public setting and people could come in and go.

1894
03:31:28.500 --> 03:31:39.000
And I understand it was more of a free-flowing involvement of the public that Zoom has truncated a bit for us.

1895
03:31:39.000 --> 03:31:43.000
So we've been trying to let people in.

1896
03:31:43.000 --> 03:31:47.500
I'll be with you in a second, Representative Warmer.

1897
03:31:47.500 --> 03:31:57.000
And during the end of our regular meetings And then today is just another way of getting public input.

1898
03:31:57.000 --> 03:32:01.000
Representative Weiler, do you have a question, sir?

1899
03:32:01.000 --> 03:32:11.000
I'm trying to start my video and it said you cannot start your video because the host has stopped it.

1900
03:32:11.000 --> 03:32:20.000
Well, I don't think we did that on purpose, but let me see if I can fix it.

1901
03:32:20.000 --> 03:32:25.000
It was in a different computer, so that's probably good.

1902
03:32:25.000 --> 03:32:35.500
I haven't used this one before, and the experts set it up for me, so I don't know what's going on.

1903
03:32:35.500 --> 03:32:37.500
There you go.

1904
03:32:37.500 --> 03:32:39.500
Thank you.

1905
03:32:39.500 --> 03:32:42.500
I don't know what's going on.

1906
03:32:42.500 --> 03:32:44.500
There you go.

1907
03:32:44.500 --> 03:32:46.500
Okay, there you are.

1908
03:32:46.500 --> 03:32:53.000
All right, so with that in mind, we have a number of speakers.

1909
03:32:53.000 --> 03:33:02.000
We gave each a request to plan on having a nice, tight presentation, no greater than 10 minutes.

1910
03:33:02.000 --> 03:33:10.000
I don't think we're going to have to manage that strictly, but that is our objective.

1911
03:33:10.000 --> 03:33:17.000
So with that, if you could bring in our first speaker, Granite Case Management.

1912
03:33:17.000 --> 03:33:19.500
Can you do that, Kevin?

1913
03:33:19.500 --> 03:33:21.500
Yes.

1914
03:33:21.500 --> 03:33:32.000
And I'm going to turn off my video because I haven't finished my lunch and no one wants to see that.

1915
03:33:32.000 --> 03:33:38.500
So, Granite State case management is Senator Clegg and Carolyn Virtue, I believe.

1916
03:33:38.500 --> 03:33:41.000
You're on mute right now.

1917
03:33:41.000 --> 03:33:43.000
There you go.

1918
03:33:43.000 --> 03:33:45.000
You are.

1919
03:33:45.000 --> 03:33:47.000
You can speak.

1920
03:33:47.000 --> 03:33:49.500
Do you have a presentation?

1921
03:33:49.500 --> 03:33:54.500
I think as a panelist, you can share your screen.

1922
03:33:54.500 --> 03:33:58.500
Do you see the share your screen button?

1923
03:33:58.500 --> 03:34:00.500
I don't, but...

1924
03:34:00.500 --> 03:34:02.500
And then Mr.

1925
03:34:02.500 --> 03:34:07.500
Ripple, I think they sent a copy to the LBA.

1926
03:34:07.500 --> 03:34:10.000
I don't know if you...

1927
03:34:10.000 --> 03:34:15.000
We sent a copy of the presentation to the LBA.

1928
03:34:15.000 --> 03:34:54.000
That would go in that way um we don't find yeah let me just find that and i can open it up and share my screen that'd be great while i'm waiting i want to just say that uh ken weila that's a great haircut could you send that to all of us uh mr rebel please yep thanks it's also posted on the website i'll get it from there thanks just one moment So far, so good.

1929
03:34:54.000 --> 03:34:56.000
We see you both.

1930
03:34:56.000 --> 03:34:58.000
Excellent.

1931
03:34:58.000 --> 03:35:01.500
Do you want me to start, Mr.

1932
03:35:01.500 --> 03:35:03.500
Chairman?

1933
03:35:03.500 --> 03:35:05.500
Go ahead.

1934
03:35:05.500 --> 03:35:11.000
Unless you think you need the PowerPoint, you can go ahead.

1935
03:35:11.000 --> 03:35:14.000
I can start a little bit.

1936
03:35:14.000 --> 03:35:20.000
One of the things we want to cover is the Medicaid population.

1937
03:35:20.000 --> 03:35:31.500
And I just want to remind folks, I know there's a lot of folks there that have been there longer than I have.

1938
03:35:31.500 --> 03:35:54.500
But I just want anybody who doesn't remember that when the state of New Hampshire originally went out for managed care, the actuaries had said that the state of New Hampshire was doing such a great job that there really wasn't any money to be saved.

1939
03:35:54.500 --> 03:36:12.000
So part of the cost equation that we see now is because we moved from using our own people who were doing a great job into a place where people needed to actually make money.

1940
03:36:12.000 --> 03:36:19.000
And even though we thought that we were going to get savings, we didn't.

1941
03:36:19.000 --> 03:36:24.000
So my first page starts with the Medicaid care management.

1942
03:36:24.000 --> 03:36:26.500
They're on the page two.

1943
03:36:26.500 --> 03:36:28.500
I'm sorry, page two?

1944
03:36:28.500 --> 03:36:30.500
Yeah.

1945
03:36:30.500 --> 03:36:45.000
When we look at that, the department implemented the Medicaid care management through a contract which had told us that there was anticipated savings of about 30 million dollars.

1946
03:36:45.000 --> 03:36:52.500
As you can see from the chart, the costs have done nothing but gone up.

1947
03:36:52.500 --> 03:37:02.000
And part of the reason is that only three percent of the actual population is being served by this.

1948
03:37:02.000 --> 03:37:12.000
So we're spending an awful lot of money for a small amount of people, and the savings just aren't there.

1949
03:37:12.000 --> 03:37:25.000
And again, I want to point out that the difference between a company that needs to make money and the people we had before is huge.

1950
03:37:25.000 --> 03:37:32.000
And that's one of the biggest problems with what we see in this paper.

1951
03:37:32.000 --> 03:37:42.500
You'll see now between 2014 and now, we're up to over a billion dollars for this particular portion of the system.

1952
03:37:42.500 --> 03:37:53.500
Now, if we can go to page three, I just want to point out the difference between case management and care management.

1953
03:37:53.500 --> 03:37:56.500
Case management is a medical service.

1954
03:37:56.500 --> 03:38:03.500
It's defined by CMS through federal regs, and it's delivered to a recipient directly.

1955
03:38:03.500 --> 03:38:13.000
Case management consists of the services which help recipients gain access to needed medical, social, educational, and other services.

1956
03:38:13.000 --> 03:38:26.000
Case management can be targeted specifically to define groups of enrollees such as waiver populations or defined groups of individuals such as elderly and adult disabled.

1957
03:38:26.000 --> 03:38:37.500
Case management must be provided by individuals who are free from a conflict of interest, such as a fiduciary responsibility to an employer.

1958
03:38:37.500 --> 03:38:54.000
Case management services include assessment of an eligible recipient, development of a specific care plan, referral to services, and monitoring and follow-up activities, case management may not be provided by the insurance company.

1959
03:38:54.000 --> 03:38:57.500
Now, care management is not case management.

1960
03:38:57.500 --> 03:39:00.000
It's actually the insurance company.

1961
03:39:00.000 --> 03:39:15.500
When care management is provided by the insurers, such as the NMCO, it's considered to be an administrative or financial function of the insurance company, according to CMS and federal regulations.

1962
03:39:15.500 --> 03:39:17.500
Thank you.

1963
03:39:17.500 --> 03:39:29.000
such as the NMCO, it's considered to be an administrative or financial function of the insurance company, according to CMS and federal regulations.

1964
03:39:29.000 --> 03:39:35.000
Care management is not a recognized medical service delivered to a recipient.

1965
03:39:35.000 --> 03:39:51.500
Although the function may be performed by medical personnel, these individuals are not employed to deliver a medical service to a consumer, and they're not required to be free from conflict of interest.

1966
03:39:51.500 --> 03:40:08.500
Primary goal of care management is to authorize and manage consumption of services to benefit the bottom line of an insurer which may or may not result in a positive outcome for the recipient.

1967
03:40:08.500 --> 03:40:12.000
And here's my ad for the day.

1968
03:40:12.000 --> 03:40:19.000
New Hampshire has a disparity rate issue with case management rates which is prohibited.

1969
03:40:19.000 --> 03:40:26.000
It's been stated in the budget before you is intended to fix this issue.

1970
03:40:26.000 --> 03:40:34.500
Please consider putting a note in the budget which specifies the rate to be paid case management.

1971
03:40:34.500 --> 03:40:38.500
If we go to the next slide please.

1972
03:40:38.500 --> 03:40:44.000
These are three contracts or examples of contracts with no deliverables.

1973
03:40:44.000 --> 03:40:55.000
In 2012, New Hampshire was the first state in the country to receive new Medicaid grant dollars under the Balancing Incentive Program.

1974
03:40:55.000 --> 03:40:59.500
Some of you may remember we call it BIP.

1975
03:40:59.500 --> 03:41:13.500
And we were awarded $26.5 million over three years, provided by the Affordable Care Act to keep people out of institutions and living productive lives in their communities.

1976
03:41:13.500 --> 03:41:31.000
Proportion of these funds were used to contract with the University of Maine, Muskegee School of Public Service, and in November 26, 2013, work began on developing a conflict-free case management model for New Hampshire.

1977
03:41:31.000 --> 03:41:40.000
The resulting report was not released by New Hampshire DHHS because they did not like the report's solution.

1978
03:41:40.000 --> 03:41:43.500
Three of New Hampshire's 1950 C waivers.

1979
03:41:43.500 --> 03:41:51.500
Senator Clegg, just if you would, would you be careful not to imply motivations of DHHS?

1980
03:41:51.500 --> 03:41:56.000
It's a big department with a lot of people.

1981
03:41:56.000 --> 03:42:04.500
So I understand that your perception is that they didn't like the results, so they buried it.

1982
03:42:04.500 --> 03:42:11.000
But I just would ask you to be a little careful there, sir.

1983
03:42:11.000 --> 03:42:13.000
OK.

1984
03:42:13.000 --> 03:42:23.500
So we're under a corrective action plan for failing to mitigate the conflict of interest violations of the case management provided.

1985
03:42:23.500 --> 03:42:41.000
Then we move to Navigant guide house contract, which was first approved by the GNC on May 17, 2017, and was item 12 being subsequently amended by GNC on April of 2019 as item 14.

1986
03:42:41.000 --> 03:42:44.500
The report has yet to be released.

1987
03:42:44.500 --> 03:42:47.000
The contract amount was $754,300.

1988
03:42:47.000 --> 03:42:56.000
The contractor met with over 100 stakeholders to solicit input to develop a plan for the CFI waiver.

1989
03:42:56.000 --> 03:43:02.500
The report was due by the contract end date of June 30, 2020.

1990
03:43:02.500 --> 03:43:15.000
On August 3, 2020, in regard to questions about the report, the department staff reported, we are validating the stakeholder input through our data-driven work.

1991
03:43:15.000 --> 03:43:24.000
The Alvarez and Masal contract, this is a sole source contract that went through GMC on September 2020.

1992
03:43:24.000 --> 03:43:32.500
As an information item only, the contract amount is for $1.5 million, all federal CARES Act funds.

1993
03:43:32.500 --> 03:43:53.500
The contract's purpose is stated as, the purpose of this agreement is for the contractor to conduct strategic assessment of the department's operations to quantify the financial impact the COVID-19 pandemic has had on the department's expenditures and revenues and general operations.

1994
03:43:53.500 --> 03:44:08.000
The contract will identify programmatic quality improvements to increase the efficiency of department operations, reduce cost savings, and improve the delivery of services during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.

1995
03:44:08.000 --> 03:44:21.000
The contract's specific reliance on department leadership to develop a plan to identify and discuss strategic priorities, legislative and funding challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic.

1996
03:44:21.000 --> 03:44:26.000
Also long-term goals with department leadership without any stakeholder input.

1997
03:44:26.000 --> 03:44:36.500
If the stakeholder input had been solicited, this would yet be one more report they did not find the solutions in.

1998
03:44:36.500 --> 03:44:40.000
We go to the next one, MMIS.

1999
03:44:40.000 --> 03:44:42.500
Good slide number, isn't it?

2000
03:44:42.500 --> 03:44:45.000
Uh, no, we got it.

2001
03:44:45.000 --> 03:44:55.500
This is the, one of the other problems that we've had over the years, it's the MMIS, Medicaid Management Information System.

2002
03:44:55.500 --> 03:45:03.000
Believe it or not, I was actually in the legislature when we started this one.

2003
03:45:03.000 --> 03:45:16.000
The new MMIS system contract was originally led in in December of 2005 to affiliated computer services, which was then brought up by Xerox in 2010.

2004
03:45:16.000 --> 03:45:22.500
The total contract cost, total of the initial contract was for $60 million.

2005
03:45:22.500 --> 03:45:26.000
$26 million was for the design phase.

2006
03:45:26.000 --> 03:45:30.500
$34 million was for a full five-year operational phase.

2007
03:45:30.500 --> 03:45:42.000
The design phase was supposed to be completed by the end of 2007 and operations were scheduled to begin on January 1, 2008.

2008
03:45:42.000 --> 03:45:50.500
By June of 2014, shortly after the new system went live, the cost skyrocketed over $117 million.

2009
03:45:50.500 --> 03:46:07.500
The union later reported that the MS design had been modified at least five times with the executive council repeatedly voting to extend the contract after Xerox missed eight deadlines over a six-year period.

2010
03:46:07.500 --> 03:46:21.500
According to the paper, the reason for the design changes and delays were caused by both state and federal regulations, system requirements, as well as contractive information problems.

2011
03:46:21.500 --> 03:46:39.000
New Hampshire continued to pay EDS, which is now HP, the legacy vendor and losing vendor to keep the existing system operation for those nine years at a cost of over $8 million a year.

2012
03:46:39.000 --> 03:46:47.000
We paid almost as much to maintain the system as we did for the new one.

2013
03:46:47.000 --> 03:47:44.000
Now, I'm going to say from personal experience back then, the problem with that is the legislature didn't keep control what they allowed was they allowed the agency to continuously make changes add different parts and then as one person said instead of starting with something off the shelf we thought we had to start with something that was brand new and when you get 15 people deciding what goes into it you've got soup that doesn't taste very good and and I would say that was one of the biggest boondoggles because even now while this was supposed to replace all of the systems it hasn't and it really doesn't work that well.

2014
03:47:44.000 --> 03:47:46.000
Next slide, please.

2015
03:47:46.000 --> 03:47:49.000
The New Hampshire state plan amendments.

2016
03:47:49.000 --> 03:47:56.500
New Hampshire has several of these for case management which have been approved by CMS.

2017
03:47:56.500 --> 03:48:01.000
The department is not in compliance with the SBA.

2018
03:48:01.000 --> 03:48:06.500
It is filed for the waivers which are under corrective action.

2019
03:48:06.500 --> 03:48:19.500
Not complying with the state plan amendments puts New Hampshire at great financial risk that the federal government will come in and ask for monetary recoupment.

2020
03:48:19.500 --> 03:48:21.500
Next slide, please.

2021
03:48:21.500 --> 03:48:28.000
We've also started with the money follows the person nursing home transition grant.

2022
03:48:28.000 --> 03:48:42.000
That started off as a robust program contracted to the New Hampshire Healthcare Association and New Hampshire Independent Case Management Association, which was very successful by any measure.

2023
03:48:42.000 --> 03:48:51.000
New Hampshire DHHS made a decision to bring the program back into the department and the program floundered.

2024
03:48:51.000 --> 03:49:07.500
New Hampshire missed the September 2020 opportunity when the Senators for Medicare and Medicaid Services offered 33 states up to $165 million in supplemental funding to states currently operating Money Follows the Person.

2025
03:49:07.500 --> 03:49:21.500
There will be awards for 2021 and we strongly suggest that this committee take a look at how we might be able to receive some of that money.

2026
03:49:21.500 --> 03:49:23.500
Next slide please.

2027
03:49:23.500 --> 03:49:32.000
For over 20 years, New Hampshire stated the goal to rebalance its long-term services and support system.

2028
03:49:32.000 --> 03:49:44.000
That's for our elderly and adult populations and move from a heavily institutional-based model to a less costly model with more community-based care options.

2029
03:49:44.000 --> 03:49:54.000
New Hampshire DHHS has expended millions of federal dollars in SIM, VEP, MFP, et cetera, to accomplish the stated goal.

2030
03:49:54.000 --> 03:50:01.000
There is no measure by which you could establish this goal has been achieved.

2031
03:50:01.000 --> 03:50:12.000
When we look at the demographic data on COVID-19 deaths, over 70% of the deaths were residents of New Hampshire nursing homes.

2032
03:50:12.000 --> 03:50:18.000
And we have learned nothing else from the experience of the pandemic.

2033
03:50:18.000 --> 03:50:25.500
It has brought to light our failures in LTSS and it's time we acknowledge them.

2034
03:50:25.500 --> 03:50:36.500
Once again, for the next biennium, the institutional arm of the system will be funded at far greater than the community alternative.

2035
03:50:36.500 --> 03:50:46.500
If the immediate needs of the community-based care system are not addressed, we will lose the option of community-based care.

2036
03:50:46.500 --> 03:50:56.000
New Hampshire has state plan amendments for the 1915 C waiver case management, which has been approved by CMS.

2037
03:50:56.000 --> 03:51:05.000
The department is not in compliance with the SBA for the waivers which we are under corrective action.

2038
03:51:05.000 --> 03:51:07.000
Next slide for duplication.

2039
03:51:07.000 --> 03:51:09.000
Thank you.

2040
03:51:09.000 --> 03:51:21.500
We have an example of what we consider to be duplication and it's in the the 2021 House Bill 2, 38 Managed Care Contract deliverables.

2041
03:51:21.500 --> 03:51:31.000
The appropriation is for the Department of Health and Human Services expanded and continued admissions, discharge, transfer event notifications.

2042
03:51:31.000 --> 03:51:57.500
There is hereby appropriated the Department of Health and Human Services the sum of 200,000 for the biennium ending June 30, 2023, to support expanded and continued admission, discharge, transfer events, notification capabilities that accelerate notifications of a patient's admission, discharge, and or transfer to other health providers involved in a patient's care.

2043
03:51:57.500 --> 03:52:08.000
The governor is authorized to draw a warrant to send some out of the money in the treasury not otherwise appropriate.

2044
03:52:08.000 --> 03:52:25.000
Then on 2.1, 1-2-2.1, transitional case management means the responsibility of the MCO to manage transitions of care for all members moving from one clinical setting to another to prevent unplanned or unnecessary readmissions.

2045
03:52:25.000 --> 03:52:44.500
ED visits or adverse health outcomes, the MOO shall maintain and operate formalized hospital and or institutional discharge planning program that includes effective post-discharge transitional care management, including appropriate discharge planning for short-term and long-term hospital and institutional states.

2046
03:52:44.500 --> 03:53:08.500
Transitional health care means care that is available from a primary or specialty provider for clinical assessment and care, planning within two weeks, business days of discharge for the inpatient, or institutional care for the physical and mental health disorders or discharge from a substance use disorder treatment.

2047
03:53:08.500 --> 03:53:17.500
What we're saying here is, do we really need $200,000 to have two people talk to each other?

2048
03:53:17.500 --> 03:53:22.000
They both seem to be doing the same thing.

2049
03:53:22.000 --> 03:53:27.500
So I question whether or not it really costs us $200,000.

2050
03:53:27.500 --> 03:53:32.000
Maybe they can just share a piece of paper.

2051
03:53:32.000 --> 03:53:35.500
My last slide is about real people.

2052
03:53:35.500 --> 03:53:56.500
It's my personal opinion that DHHS has lost sight of its mission and what it means to address the needs of real people with real issues and to give them the tools they need to continue to live in the real world.

2053
03:53:56.500 --> 03:54:03.000
Institutionalization serves neither the state nor the people we call our fellow citizens.

2054
03:54:03.000 --> 03:54:10.000
We spend millions of dollars looking for solutions that are not accepted when offered.

2055
03:54:10.000 --> 03:54:26.500
It's time we hit the pause button, implement the solutions we have paid for, and stop spending money because we don't like the solutions offered, and dedicate those funds to the Medicaid recipients.

2056
03:54:26.500 --> 03:54:31.000
Last session you increased the DHHS budget by 24%.

2057
03:54:31.000 --> 03:54:36.000
The results so far have not resulted in any improvement.

2058
03:54:36.000 --> 03:54:50.000
It's my personal belief that we should hold on to any new spending ideas until we see the results of the 24% increase of the last session's ideas.

2059
03:54:50.000 --> 03:54:55.000
No corporation would continue to spend money without causative results.

2060
03:54:55.000 --> 03:55:07.000
And I say that after many years of being involved, that it's time that we either found out what works and what doesn't work.

2061
03:55:07.000 --> 03:55:25.000
And one of the biggest problems I see in government is when we have something that works, somebody decides to spend as much money or more on a new idea to see if there's something better.

2062
03:55:25.000 --> 03:55:32.000
My idea is that we go back to what works and we keep it.

2063
03:55:32.000 --> 03:55:40.500
Imagine living with the same program for eight years while we spend $117 million to replace it.

2064
03:55:40.500 --> 03:55:44.500
It's not as good as the old system.

2065
03:55:44.500 --> 03:55:50.500
So why did we even need to replace it to begin with?

2066
03:55:50.500 --> 03:56:15.500
don't know so my suggestion is on a personal level that your committee look at leaving the budget the way it is and asking HHS to actually show how services were improved for the people that you serve and not just how the bottom line improves thank Thank you, Mr.

2067
03:56:15.500 --> 03:56:17.500
Chairman, for the opportunity.

2068
03:56:17.500 --> 03:56:22.000
You can ask any questions if you have any.

2069
03:56:22.000 --> 03:56:31.000
First, I want to thank you for putting this together and coming in and spending time with us.

2070
03:56:31.000 --> 03:56:45.000
You did that at my request because I was interested in a 10-year overview, and I thank you for volunteering your time in the way that you have.

2071
03:56:45.000 --> 03:56:50.500
So are there any questions for Senator Clegg or Carolyn Virtue?

2072
03:56:50.500 --> 03:56:53.500
I see one from Representative Weiler.

2073
03:56:53.500 --> 03:56:55.500
Thank you, Mr.

2074
03:56:55.500 --> 03:56:57.500
Chairman.

2075
03:56:57.500 --> 03:57:03.000
I just want to say hello to my two old friends.

2076
03:57:03.000 --> 03:57:06.000
And thank you for that information.

2077
03:57:06.000 --> 03:57:09.000
We never hear it from HHS.

2078
03:57:09.000 --> 03:57:12.000
So I appreciate that other view.

2079
03:57:12.000 --> 03:57:14.000
Thank you.

2080
03:57:14.000 --> 03:57:16.000
Thank you, Mr.

2081
03:57:16.000 --> 03:57:18.000
Chairman.

2082
03:57:18.000 --> 03:57:21.000
That's wonderful to see you today.

2083
03:57:21.000 --> 03:57:29.000
If I may, I do miss not sitting in those plastic chairs for hours on end.

2084
03:57:29.000 --> 03:57:32.000
Well, we have different chairs now.

2085
03:57:32.000 --> 03:57:39.500
We get to pick our own at our own house, so it's a little different.

2086
03:57:39.500 --> 03:57:41.500
All right.

2087
03:57:41.500 --> 03:57:43.500
Well, thank you.

2088
03:57:43.500 --> 03:57:54.500
Just to take note of the time, we invested almost 20 minutes there, which is a little bit more than I anticipated.

2089
03:57:54.500 --> 03:58:01.000
What I'm going to do at this point is to have Representative Walner.

2090
03:58:01.000 --> 03:58:12.500
And I don't know if we talked about this very thoroughly, but I know that you've invited Gina Balkus, Maura O'Neill, Jackie Kroll.

2091
03:58:12.500 --> 03:58:22.000
So maybe we can give you 30 to 40 minutes to see if you can get those three through.

2092
03:58:22.000 --> 03:58:25.500
If you can't, don't sweat it, okay?

2093
03:58:25.500 --> 03:58:32.500
Okay, I actually, I think that we actually had told the folks 20 minutes.

2094
03:58:32.500 --> 03:58:37.000
I thought that was what our, what it was.

2095
03:58:37.000 --> 03:58:39.000
You are absolutely right.

2096
03:58:39.000 --> 03:58:41.000
No, no.

2097
03:58:41.000 --> 03:58:44.500
I don't think we can do it.

2098
03:58:44.500 --> 03:58:50.000
I have to correct myself because you're right and I'm wrong.

2099
03:58:50.000 --> 03:59:15.500
My memory stored 10 minutes for some reason and in fact and in fact it's 20 so you're right so you have an hour okay so um i think sharon um or kathy invited gina balkas and so i would let them take introduce her um i invited her kevin is?

2100
03:59:15.500 --> 03:59:18.500
Yep, I'm bringing her in now.

2101
03:59:18.500 --> 03:59:21.000
She's there but she's muted.

2102
03:59:21.000 --> 03:59:23.000
Yes, good afternoon.

2103
03:59:23.000 --> 03:59:25.000
Thank you so much.

2104
03:59:25.000 --> 03:59:27.500
I'll let you introduce yourself.

2105
03:59:27.500 --> 03:59:29.500
Go ahead.

2106
03:59:29.500 --> 03:59:31.500
Thank you so much.

2107
03:59:31.500 --> 03:59:37.500
My sound clicked off there for a minute when Kevin connected me.

2108
03:59:37.500 --> 03:59:42.000
Thank you so much for inviting me, Representative Rogers.

2109
03:59:42.000 --> 03:59:57.500
My name is Gina Balkus, and I am the CEO of the Home Care Hospice and Palliative Care Alliance and its advocacy affiliate, the Granite State Home Health and Hospice Association.

2110
03:59:57.500 --> 04:00:03.000
And we represent about 43 home care agencies across the state.

2111
04:00:03.000 --> 04:00:09.000
And Representative Rogers invited me today to speak about choices for independence.

2112
04:00:09.000 --> 04:00:12.500
And I was planning on 20 minutes.

2113
04:00:12.500 --> 04:00:14.500
I have 10 slides.

2114
04:00:14.500 --> 04:00:23.000
I think I can get through it in less than that, but let's see how it goes.

2115
04:00:23.000 --> 04:00:27.500
So I'm gonna try to share my screen now.

2116
04:00:27.500 --> 04:00:30.000
You do have 20 minutes.

2117
04:00:30.000 --> 04:00:33.000
I apologize for being confused earlier.

2118
04:00:33.000 --> 04:00:35.500
And can everybody see this?

2119
04:00:35.500 --> 04:00:37.500
No.

2120
04:00:37.500 --> 04:00:40.000
Can you see my screen?

2121
04:00:40.000 --> 04:00:48.500
Not, well we can see you but we can't see uh we can't see the present Okay.

2122
04:00:48.500 --> 04:00:51.500
Let me go back in here.

2123
04:00:51.500 --> 04:00:53.500
I'll share.

2124
04:00:53.500 --> 04:00:55.500
Okay.

2125
04:00:55.500 --> 04:00:59.000
And let me, can you see that?

2126
04:00:59.000 --> 04:01:01.000
Yes.

2127
04:01:01.000 --> 04:01:03.000
Great.

2128
04:01:03.000 --> 04:01:05.000
Yes.

2129
04:01:05.000 --> 04:01:07.000
Thank you.

2130
04:01:07.000 --> 04:01:09.000
Okay.

2131
04:01:09.000 --> 04:01:18.000
So, as I mentioned, I will, we've got a lot to cover, so I will get through this.

2132
04:01:18.000 --> 04:01:34.500
So yesterday you had a presentation from the Department of Health and Human Services, and Deb Sheets spoke about the Choices for Independence program, and I'm going to just review it really quickly.

2133
04:01:34.500 --> 04:01:38.500
So CFI is a waiver service under Medicaid.

2134
04:01:38.500 --> 04:01:42.500
It's really intended for elderly and adult citizens.

2135
04:01:42.500 --> 04:01:50.000
Adults can be anywhere from 21 and up who need nursing home level of care.

2136
04:01:50.000 --> 04:01:54.500
And so those folks go through a financial eligibility.

2137
04:01:54.500 --> 04:02:04.500
So it's based, it's primarily for low income individuals and a clinical eligibility where they're assessed by a department nurse.

2138
04:02:04.500 --> 04:02:10.500
And then they're determined to be eligible for services by BES staff.

2139
04:02:10.500 --> 04:02:22.000
But I think the important thing to remember here is that these people are determined to need a nursing home level of care.

2140
04:02:22.000 --> 04:02:27.500
So they're very vulnerable and they need a lot of support.

2141
04:02:27.500 --> 04:02:37.500
But the beauty of the Choices for Independence program is it allows people to live at home with supportive services.

2142
04:02:37.500 --> 04:02:48.500
And let's face it, most people would prefer to be at home rather than in a group setting or a nursing home.

2143
04:02:48.500 --> 04:02:58.500
But the other beauty of CFI, when it's working well, is that it's a really good investment for the state.

2144
04:02:58.500 --> 04:03:08.500
The average annual cost is less than $20,000 per year per individual compared to over $50,000 for nursing home care.

2145
04:03:08.500 --> 04:03:10.500
So, Mr.

2146
04:03:10.500 --> 04:03:18.000
Chairman, you asked that when we speak, we talk about the lines that we're addressing.

2147
04:03:18.000 --> 04:03:23.500
And yesterday, I believe that Karen Rounds showed you this page.

2148
04:03:23.500 --> 04:03:27.500
This is page 551 in House Bill 1.

2149
04:03:27.500 --> 04:03:31.000
And specifically, CFI is in three lines.

2150
04:03:31.000 --> 04:03:34.000
So line 505 is mid-level care.

2151
04:03:34.000 --> 04:03:41.000
That's residential care facilities, meaning not nursing homes, but residences for seniors assisted living.

2152
04:03:41.000 --> 04:03:44.000
506 is home support waiver services.

2153
04:03:44.000 --> 04:03:50.000
And you'll notice that this line has about $56 million in it.

2154
04:03:50.000 --> 04:03:53.500
I call this the kitchen sink line.

2155
04:03:53.500 --> 04:03:56.000
There's a lot in this.

2156
04:03:56.000 --> 04:03:58.000
There's personal care services.

2157
04:03:58.000 --> 04:04:00.500
There is meals on wheels.

2158
04:04:00.500 --> 04:04:04.500
The case managers get paid from this line.

2159
04:04:04.500 --> 04:04:12.000
Things like pill planners, equipment that people might need at home is in class 506.

2160
04:04:12.000 --> 04:04:19.000
And then class 529 home health waiver services are some specific home health services.

2161
04:04:19.000 --> 04:04:30.500
So I'm going to, and I'm here today to talk specifically about the home health services that are delivered in these two lines.

2162
04:04:30.500 --> 04:04:32.500
Thank you.

2163
04:04:32.500 --> 04:04:41.000
here today to talk specifically about the home health services that are delivered in these two lines.

2164
04:04:41.000 --> 04:04:45.000
So let's talk about what those services are.

2165
04:04:45.000 --> 04:04:49.000
For CFI clients, they can receive nursing visits.

2166
04:04:49.000 --> 04:05:00.500
Keep in mind that if they were in a nursing home, they would be a nurse overseeing their care 24 hours a day.

2167
04:05:00.500 --> 04:05:06.000
So nurses visit the client as determined based on their needs.

2168
04:05:06.000 --> 04:05:12.000
It might be once a week, twice a week, once a month.

2169
04:05:12.000 --> 04:05:20.000
And there are clinical assessments done to check in to see how the client is doing.

2170
04:05:20.000 --> 04:05:22.500
They put together care plans.

2171
04:05:22.500 --> 04:05:26.000
They address wound care and catheter care.

2172
04:05:26.000 --> 04:05:32.000
A lot of what they do is help people with their medications.

2173
04:05:32.000 --> 04:05:36.000
So it comes from filling the pill planners.

2174
04:05:36.000 --> 04:05:46.000
When the doctor changes the medication, it's a nurse that goes to the home to change out the pill planner.

2175
04:05:46.000 --> 04:05:51.500
And be sure that clients are getting the medications they need.

2176
04:05:51.500 --> 04:05:56.000
There's also a lot of patient and family education.

2177
04:05:56.000 --> 04:05:58.500
This is what nurses do.

2178
04:05:58.500 --> 04:06:01.500
They help people understand their illnesses.

2179
04:06:01.500 --> 04:06:26.000
They help them understand how they can care for themselves, what they need to do, for instance, to deal with their diabetes in terms of eating well, what they need to be careful of if they have congestive heart failure so that they're not eating too much salty food.

2180
04:06:26.000 --> 04:06:29.500
So this is what really nurses do.

2181
04:06:29.500 --> 04:06:33.000
And then they supervise home health aides.

2182
04:06:33.000 --> 04:06:36.000
And this is in class 529.

2183
04:06:36.000 --> 04:06:40.000
The next category is home health aid services.

2184
04:06:40.000 --> 04:06:49.000
And there's a lot of correlation between what home health aides do and what personal care providers do.

2185
04:06:49.000 --> 04:06:53.000
But home health aides are licensed nursing assistants.

2186
04:06:53.000 --> 04:06:56.500
They're licensed by the Board of Nursing.

2187
04:06:56.500 --> 04:07:08.000
They've completed 100 hours of training and they work under the supervision of a nurse and they observe and they report medical conditions.

2188
04:07:08.000 --> 04:07:11.500
They assist with bathing, toileting, dental care.

2189
04:07:11.500 --> 04:07:18.000
They help with the transfers in and out of bed, dressing, walking, feeding.

2190
04:07:18.000 --> 04:07:22.000
They can be delegated to actually administer medications.

2191
04:07:22.000 --> 04:07:27.500
So they're a higher level of service than personal care services.

2192
04:07:27.500 --> 04:07:30.500
These are also in class 529.

2193
04:07:30.500 --> 04:07:34.000
Personal care services is in class 506.

2194
04:07:34.000 --> 04:07:36.500
And these are unlicensed personnel.

2195
04:07:36.500 --> 04:07:45.000
They have about 16 hours of training, six of which is specifically state mandated dementia care training.

2196
04:07:45.000 --> 04:07:55.000
And I might add that the LNAs also have to go through those six hours of mandated dementia care training.

2197
04:07:55.000 --> 04:07:59.500
And personal care providers do bathing, toileting, dental care.

2198
04:07:59.500 --> 04:08:04.500
Once again, they assist with these activities of daily living.

2199
04:08:04.500 --> 04:08:14.000
They remind people to take their medications, and they might do transportation to, say, grocery, pharmacy, and other services.

2200
04:08:14.000 --> 04:08:16.500
So what's the difference here?

2201
04:08:16.500 --> 04:08:47.500
Really, what you're talking about here is you might send an L&A to a CFI client who has some serious medical conditions, whereas somebody here might get personal care services for somebody who may not have medical conditions, but is just simply frail and needs some help, you know, around the house, getting up and out of bed, that sort of thing.

2202
04:08:47.500 --> 04:08:50.000
And some clients get both.

2203
04:08:50.000 --> 04:09:05.000
You know, you might have a home health aide who goes in twice a week, but then you have a personal care provider who goes in five days a week.

2204
04:09:05.000 --> 04:09:08.000
And then we have homemaker services.

2205
04:09:08.000 --> 04:09:11.500
And this is also in class 526.

2206
04:09:11.500 --> 04:09:20.500
And this is light housekeeping, grocery shopping, changing the sheets, doing the laundry, preparing meals for the week.

2207
04:09:20.500 --> 04:09:31.000
So these are the type of services that help people remain independent and stay at home and out of nursing homes.

2208
04:09:31.000 --> 04:09:36.500
So let's talk about some of the challenges that CFI has.

2209
04:09:36.500 --> 04:09:42.000
And I think this is something that Deb Sheets addressed yesterday.

2210
04:09:42.000 --> 04:09:50.000
First of all, you have a growing caseload and that's a function of New Hampshire's demographics.

2211
04:09:50.000 --> 04:09:52.500
We are an aging state.

2212
04:09:52.500 --> 04:10:00.000
We have one of the highest levels of people over age 65 in the country.

2213
04:10:00.000 --> 04:10:11.000
And so as you can see, between 2015 and 2020, the caseload of people who relying on CFI services has really grown.

2214
04:10:11.000 --> 04:10:19.000
But then there's another real more serious challenge with increasing caseload, and that's gaps of care.

2215
04:10:19.000 --> 04:10:24.500
And when I say gaps of care, I mean undelivered services.

2216
04:10:24.500 --> 04:10:26.500
So the alliance...

2217
04:10:26.500 --> 04:10:31.500
I just want to make sure I'm understanding these percentages.

2218
04:10:31.500 --> 04:10:34.500
Are these services that are okay?

2219
04:10:34.500 --> 04:10:43.000
In this case, in skilled nursing visits, are we providing 68% of the work or only 32%?

2220
04:10:43.000 --> 04:10:50.000
We're providing 68% of the work and 32% of the authorized services are undelivered.

2221
04:10:50.000 --> 04:10:55.000
So let me just explain the process a little bit.

2222
04:10:55.000 --> 04:11:17.000
When somebody is determined to be eligible for the program, and that eligibility can take about 60 days is what Deb told you yesterday, then they are assigned an independent case manager, very much like Granite State case management that from our previous speakers.

2223
04:11:17.000 --> 04:11:30.000
That case manager, the department authorizes a range of services and says to the case manager, these are the service that the client is authorized for.

2224
04:11:30.000 --> 04:11:32.500
You go make it happen.

2225
04:11:32.500 --> 04:11:48.500
And then somebody like Carolyn Virtue will then reach out to Meals on Wheels, to a home health agency, to DME providers, to others to get them the services that they need.

2226
04:11:48.500 --> 04:12:06.000
So what I'm showing you here is that between 2017 and 2020, the department authorized a set of services and in the the case of skilled nursing, 32% of the authorized services were not delivered.

2227
04:12:06.000 --> 04:12:09.500
That's the average over the four years.

2228
04:12:09.500 --> 04:12:17.000
For home health aid, when I say short visits, it means visits under two hours.

2229
04:12:17.000 --> 04:12:22.000
45% of those visits that were authorized were not delivered.

2230
04:12:22.000 --> 04:12:32.500
For home health aid long visits, these are visits that are over two hours, 31% of the visits were not delivered.

2231
04:12:32.500 --> 04:12:43.500
In personal care, which is the largest service that is provided from home health agencies, 25% of the services were not delivered.

2232
04:12:43.500 --> 04:12:46.000
Homemaker services, 45% not delivered.

2233
04:12:46.000 --> 04:12:50.000
So let's talk about what that really means.

2234
04:12:50.000 --> 04:13:10.500
If somebody has diabetes or congestive heart failure and they need a nurse, you know, to be coming in to check on them, it means that, you know, some of their visits that they're authorized to get, they are not receiving.

2235
04:13:10.500 --> 04:13:26.000
In the case of personal care and home health aides, sometimes this is helping people get out of bed in the morning, helping them get out of bed and get dressed.

2236
04:13:26.000 --> 04:13:43.000
So if they're authorized for seven days a week to have somebody help them get undressed, and they can only receive services for five days a week, what happens on those other two days?

2237
04:13:43.000 --> 04:13:45.000
If there is...

2238
04:13:45.000 --> 04:13:56.500
come help them get undressed and they can only receive services for five days a week, what happens on those other two days?

2239
04:13:56.500 --> 04:14:03.500
If they're incontinent, it means they may not get a bath or a shower.

2240
04:14:03.500 --> 04:14:16.000
It means that their sheets that may need to be changed on a daily basis because of their incontinence don't get changed half the time.

2241
04:14:16.000 --> 04:14:37.000
And, you know, as somebody who cared for my aging parents before they died, I know how important it is for elderly people or people who have disabilities to get these services every day for the services if that's what they need.

2242
04:14:37.000 --> 04:14:39.500
Missing a day has consequences.

2243
04:14:39.500 --> 04:14:57.000
And I think that a really good example for, say, somebody who might be elderly and incontinent is that if they're not bathed regularly, if their garments not changed regularly, then they develop skin sores.

2244
04:14:57.000 --> 04:15:11.500
If they don't get out of bed every day, or if they sit in their chair all day, if they don't get up and moving, they get pressure ulcers.

2245
04:15:11.500 --> 04:15:25.500
And those pressure ulcers, if they're not seen on a regular basis by their nurse or their home health aid, can result in major infections that require hospitalizations.

2246
04:15:25.500 --> 04:15:31.500
I mean, pressure ulcers are a major risk factor for elderly people.

2247
04:15:31.500 --> 04:15:39.000
And people can be in the hospital for weeks if they get a severe infection.

2248
04:15:39.000 --> 04:15:41.500
The same thing with falls.

2249
04:15:41.500 --> 04:15:54.000
If they can't get help getting out of bed and somebody falls, it can result in injuries that end up in hospitalization and rehab stays.

2250
04:15:54.000 --> 04:15:59.000
So there are real consequences to these gaps in care.

2251
04:15:59.000 --> 04:16:07.000
And I just want the committee to understand that these gaps in care are really problematic.

2252
04:16:07.000 --> 04:16:17.000
And so the other growing challenge really is that the payments to providers are just not based on economic realities.

2253
04:16:17.000 --> 04:16:22.500
And that's part of what's contributing to the gaps in care.

2254
04:16:22.500 --> 04:16:27.000
So let's talk a little bit about provider payments.

2255
04:16:27.000 --> 04:16:43.500
So when the department pays a home care agency, they pay them based on the time that the home health aide or the personal care provider or the nurse is in the home.

2256
04:16:43.500 --> 04:17:00.000
So if the provider, if the individual is authorized for say a two-hour home health aide visit, then the payment rate that is paid to them is the rate for a two-hour visit.

2257
04:17:00.000 --> 04:17:04.500
But that visit isn't all that the agency does.

2258
04:17:04.500 --> 04:17:16.000
That rate has to cover all these other expenses from not just the wages for the caregiver, but the wages for the supervisor.

2259
04:17:16.000 --> 04:17:24.500
And home care agencies also have care managers that help, that work with the independent case managers.

2260
04:17:24.500 --> 04:17:26.500
It's managers.

2261
04:17:26.500 --> 04:17:29.500
It's not a duplication of services.

2262
04:17:29.500 --> 04:17:56.000
I mean, the home care agency, before they even assign a personal caregiver, will go interview the person, that individual, to be sure to find out what they're like, what their parent personality is like, what kind of person from the agency staff is going to be the right fit for that person.

2263
04:17:56.000 --> 04:18:00.000
And then you have mileage and travel time.

2264
04:18:00.000 --> 04:18:05.500
And let's keep in mind, New Hampshire is a rural state.

2265
04:18:05.500 --> 04:18:17.500
There's a lot of driving on back roads and up mountains and dirt roads to get to the clients that rely on these services.

2266
04:18:17.500 --> 04:18:24.000
There's workers comp, payroll taxes, benefits, you know, the agency's professional liability insurance.

2267
04:18:24.000 --> 04:18:34.000
There's training, including, you know, the recently mandated six hours of dementia training a year and four hours in continuing.

2268
04:18:34.000 --> 04:18:39.000
It's a good thing, but there's a cost to it.

2269
04:18:39.000 --> 04:18:47.500
And agencies are obligated by the legislature to pay their staff while they're going through that training.

2270
04:18:47.500 --> 04:18:57.500
There's criminal background tests and TB tests, and now COVID tests that need to be done on a regular basis.

2271
04:18:57.500 --> 04:19:04.500
And then there's the administrative issues of scheduling and case management, overtime and billing.

2272
04:19:04.500 --> 04:19:18.000
So I just want you to keep in mind, as I review the rates, it's not just about the time that the client is getting one-on-one care.

2273
04:19:18.000 --> 04:19:24.500
It's about all the background information services that are provided behind the scenes.

2274
04:19:24.500 --> 04:19:28.500
And I wouldn't call that, you know, overhead.

2275
04:19:28.500 --> 04:19:32.500
This is direct expense related to the program.

2276
04:19:32.500 --> 04:19:35.500
So let's talk about the rates.

2277
04:19:35.500 --> 04:19:52.500
And I know you're the finance committee, and I hate to bore you with lots of data, but I think you're the folks that dig into this, so I want you to understand this.

2278
04:19:52.500 --> 04:20:03.500
So right now, in 2021, the rate for a nursing visit, regardless of whether it's 30 minutes or two hours, is $100.63.

2279
04:20:03.500 --> 04:20:17.500
And that's based, that includes the 3.1% rate increase that went into effect on January 1 of 2021, and is still in effect in the governor's proposed budget.

2280
04:20:17.500 --> 04:20:26.500
Okay, there is no rate increase built in to the governor's budget, it just maintains the existing rate.

2281
04:20:26.500 --> 04:20:28.500
But I Thank you.

2282
04:20:28.500 --> 04:20:30.500
budget.

2283
04:20:30.500 --> 04:20:39.500
Okay, there is no rate increase built in to the governor's budget, it just maintains the existing rate.

2284
04:20:39.500 --> 04:20:56.500
But what I've tried to do here is compare the CFI rates to the governor's proposed rates to the Title 20 and 3B program, which is another BES program that is mostly federally funded.

2285
04:20:56.500 --> 04:21:06.500
And this is for people who are under age 60, who are not on Medicaid, but who are at risk.

2286
04:21:06.500 --> 04:21:11.000
And it's like I said, it's mostly federally funded.

2287
04:21:11.000 --> 04:21:14.000
This program doesn't cover nursing visits.

2288
04:21:14.000 --> 04:21:17.000
So that's why there's an NA.

2289
04:21:17.000 --> 04:21:26.000
And then I also looked at what the national data is for private rates in the general community.

2290
04:21:26.000 --> 04:21:35.500
And so I used the Genworth cost of care survey, which is a major long-term care provider, insurance provider.

2291
04:21:35.500 --> 04:21:39.500
And these are the median rates for 2020.

2292
04:21:39.500 --> 04:21:48.000
And so median, which means some are paying more, that service did not look at nursing visits.

2293
04:21:48.000 --> 04:21:52.000
And then I looked at Medicare cost reports.

2294
04:21:52.000 --> 04:22:13.000
So the most recent cost report data available is, and this is agencies that provide care to Medicare beneficiaries have to report all their costs to the federal government and their costs include all the costs that are allocated to delivering care.

2295
04:22:13.000 --> 04:22:21.500
In the New Hampshire average for cost of care for a nursing visit is $170 a visit.

2296
04:22:21.500 --> 04:22:27.500
And that was in 2018, which is the most recent data available.

2297
04:22:27.500 --> 04:22:35.500
So this gives you a sense of where the state compares to the cost of care.

2298
04:22:35.500 --> 04:22:43.500
For home health aid visits, now the state pays out in CFI, pays it two ways.

2299
04:22:43.500 --> 04:22:51.000
If the visit is less than two hours, there's a one flat fee of $33.03.

2300
04:22:51.000 --> 04:23:06.500
If it's paid, if it's over two hours, then it's paid in 15-minute increments of $6.41 per per 15 minute, which gets you to an hourly rate of $26.64 per hour.

2301
04:23:06.500 --> 04:23:10.000
So right now, CFI is paying $33.

2302
04:23:10.000 --> 04:23:13.500
The governor's proposed budget doesn't change that.

2303
04:23:13.500 --> 04:23:26.500
There is no comparable data available for these programs, but the Medicare rate for a visit, a home health aid visit, is $60 for a visit.

2304
04:23:26.500 --> 04:23:29.000
Under the unit rates, 2664.

2305
04:23:29.000 --> 04:23:32.500
And I think this is a typo.

2306
04:23:32.500 --> 04:23:35.500
This should be also, it's unchanged.

2307
04:23:35.500 --> 04:23:37.500
It should be 2664.64.

2308
04:23:37.500 --> 04:23:44.000
So I will correct that in the PDF that I've sent to Kevin.

2309
04:23:44.000 --> 04:23:46.000
That's a typo.

2310
04:23:46.000 --> 04:23:57.000
When I've looked at New Hampshire title 20 and three B rates, the state of New Hampshire is paying $32 an hour.

2311
04:23:57.000 --> 04:24:02.500
They pay in 30 minute increments of $16 perhaps an hour.

2312
04:24:02.500 --> 04:24:11.500
So you can see there's a big discrepancy for what I would consider a lower level of care.

2313
04:24:11.500 --> 04:24:35.500
These are people that are not eligible for nursing home care, people who are in to the Title 20 programs, but they're considered at risk, whereas the people who are in CFI are eligible for nursing home care, and yet the rate is $6 an hour less, $26.64.

2314
04:24:35.500 --> 04:24:39.000
And then let's talk about personal care.

2315
04:24:39.000 --> 04:24:49.500
So currently, under the 2021 CFI rates, the state is paying $4.89 per 15-minute unit, comes out to $19.56 an hour.

2316
04:24:49.500 --> 04:25:05.500
You heard Deb Sheets from the department say yesterday that in the governor's budget, there is a budgeted rate increase to $5.62 per unit, which would get you to $22.48 an hour.

2317
04:25:05.500 --> 04:25:15.000
okay um this is still less than what I would say within $32 an hour for home health aids.

2318
04:25:15.000 --> 04:25:31.000
Although, you know, once again, this is, these people are the, the, the, the aids, the caregiver has more, a little bit more experience, but then let's look at the private marketplace.

2319
04:25:31.000 --> 04:25:36.500
The private market, the immediate rate in New Hampshire is $29.50.

2320
04:25:36.500 --> 04:25:44.000
So if you're an agency that, well, and so let's just go through Homemaker now.

2321
04:25:44.000 --> 04:25:52.000
Homemaker currently pays $5.09 for CFI, which ironically is higher than the personal care rate above.

2322
04:25:52.000 --> 04:26:19.000
So what I tell people is that the current rates, I've lost my mouse here to show you what I'm referring to, the current rates, the people who wash the laundry, the rate to pay for people who wash the laundry is higher than the CFI rate for the people who bathe the individuals.

2323
04:26:19.000 --> 04:26:26.000
So I'm pleased that the department is raising these rates and fixing this discrepancy.

2324
04:26:26.000 --> 04:26:34.500
So Deb Sheets told you yesterday that home acre rates are going up to $5.40 per unit.

2325
04:26:34.500 --> 04:26:42.500
So the rate increase that's in the governor's budget is a step in the right direction.

2326
04:26:42.500 --> 04:26:54.000
But once again, under the Title 3B program, the state pays $24 an hour for homemaker services, and the private market pays $28.50.

2327
04:26:54.000 --> 04:27:19.500
So if you're an agency that provides services to Title 20 and 3B clients, CFI clients, and private pay clients, and you only have so many caregivers to provide care, which ones would you, if you have to choose which clients you're going to serve, well, who's it going to be?

2328
04:27:19.500 --> 04:27:29.000
It will likely be the private pay in the title programs and the CFI clients will likely go unserved.

2329
04:27:29.000 --> 04:27:39.000
And that's why you're starting to see, well, you're not just starting, you've been seeing gaps in care for years.

2330
04:27:39.000 --> 04:27:43.500
But I think it's really reaching a major crisis.

2331
04:27:43.500 --> 04:27:50.000
I'm going to just cover this quickly, but Jeb alluded to workforce shortages.

2332
04:27:50.000 --> 04:27:55.000
This is the reality of the climate we are in.

2333
04:27:55.000 --> 04:28:04.000
The Home Care Alliance had Helms and Company do a vacancy rate and turnover rate survey in February.

2334
04:28:04.000 --> 04:28:12.500
So for the week of 1231, this is a snapshot in time, and it can change weekly.

2335
04:28:12.500 --> 04:28:31.500
There was a 23% vacancy rate for registered nurses and about 30 to 33% vacancy rate for licensed practical nurses, many of which do the skilled nursing visits for CFI clients, home health aid, personal care, and homemakers.

2336
04:28:31.500 --> 04:28:43.500
The staff turnover rate, which is an annual average based on their monthly payrolls, their monthly turnovers of people who are exiting the agencies.

2337
04:28:43.500 --> 04:28:46.000
Look at these turnover rates.

2338
04:28:46.000 --> 04:28:50.000
Personal care providers turning over 41% turnover rate.

2339
04:28:50.000 --> 04:28:53.500
Licensed practical nurses a 51% turnover rate.

2340
04:28:53.500 --> 04:28:58.000
This is the reality that agencies are dealing with.

2341
04:28:58.000 --> 04:29:24.500
And so when we have challenges where the rates are not adequate to pay adequate wages, and when you're in a competitive marketplace, and you have other employers like Walmart, Target, Hobby Lobby, that provide, pay $15 an hour, Costco's going up to $16 an hour for a job that's not as hard.

2342
04:29:24.500 --> 04:29:32.500
I mean, the work that personal care providers and home health aides do is hard work.

2343
04:29:32.500 --> 04:29:34.500
It's emotional work.

2344
04:29:34.500 --> 04:29:40.000
It's physically challenging to lift people in and out of bed.

2345
04:29:40.000 --> 04:29:42.500
These workforce challenges are real.

2346
04:29:42.500 --> 04:29:52.000
And unfortunately, the rates have not been adjusted over the years to reflect what's going on in the marketplace.

2347
04:29:52.000 --> 04:29:59.500
So here are some, I've got two slides to talk about the public policy issues.

2348
04:29:59.500 --> 04:30:01.500
Let's just start.

2349
04:30:01.500 --> 04:30:04.000
CFI is a great program.

2350
04:30:04.000 --> 04:30:16.500
It really helps people remain in their homes, and it's less than the cost of nursing home care, and it's where people want to be.

2351
04:30:16.500 --> 04:30:21.000
You know, New Hampshire people are, they're sturdy Yankees.

2352
04:30:21.000 --> 04:30:26.500
They don't want to depend on people, other people for care.

2353
04:30:26.500 --> 04:30:33.500
They want to be independent and CFI lets them be independent with some help.

2354
04:30:33.500 --> 04:30:47.500
But I would say that based on what I've told you about the gaps in care, that New Hampshire is really failing in its commitment to support individuals.

2355
04:30:47.500 --> 04:30:54.500
And I don't necessarily, I don't know, I can't blame the department for that.

2356
04:30:54.500 --> 04:31:07.500
I can't, you know, there's a lot of, there's a lot of going on, you know, the workforce shortage, a pandemic, especially hard in the pandemic.

2357
04:31:07.500 --> 04:31:15.500
I didn't even show you the data for the gaps in care based on the pandemic.

2358
04:31:15.500 --> 04:31:18.500
It's much, much worse in 2021.

2359
04:31:18.500 --> 04:31:28.500
But, you know, I would say that over the years, the legislature has a role to play in this problem.

2360
04:31:28.500 --> 04:31:33.500
Advocates have been asking for years for CFI rate increases.

2361
04:31:33.500 --> 04:31:44.000
I mean, when you look at the Genworth cost of care, realistically, CFI care costs increased by about 4% a year.

2362
04:31:44.000 --> 04:31:51.000
And New Hampshire has sometimes gone 10 or 12 years without a rate increase.

2363
04:31:51.000 --> 04:32:03.500
So while we got a rate increase on January 1, 3.1% on January 2021, 3.1% on January 2020, the last rate increase was in 2015.

2364
04:32:03.500 --> 04:32:10.500
So it had been 10 years prior to that where there were no increases.

2365
04:32:10.500 --> 04:32:18.500
So a lot of this is based on just public policy decisions that have been made.

2366
04:32:18.500 --> 04:32:28.000
But keep in mind that these low rates are crippling providers, and that's why you're seeing gaps in care.

2367
04:32:28.000 --> 04:32:32.000
I think that how else is it failing?

2368
04:32:32.000 --> 04:32:36.500
I mean, we are creating dangerous conditions for individuals.

2369
04:32:36.500 --> 04:32:50.500
Somebody like this gentleman, if he doesn't have help getting out of bed in the morning, if he hasn't have help getting dressed, he has a fall risk.

2370
04:32:50.500 --> 04:32:53.000
A broken hip means surgery.

2371
04:32:53.000 --> 04:32:56.000
It means time in the hospital.

2372
04:32:56.000 --> 04:33:04.500
it means months in a skilled nursing rehab facility, and maybe that person never goes back home.

2373
04:33:04.500 --> 04:33:07.500
They stay in a nursing facility.

2374
04:33:07.500 --> 04:33:31.500
um and there's really and i think the other thing that's important is there are wait lists for people to get services um there are wait lists and i think the department can't say they're a wait list because There are wait lists for people to get services.

2375
04:33:31.500 --> 04:34:02.000
There are wait lists, and I think the department can't say there are wait lists because they're not allowed to have wait lists, but the people have been determined to be eligible for care and they've been assigned to a case manager, but the case manager can't find agencies to fill the hours and provide the services that these folks need.

2376
04:34:02.000 --> 04:34:08.500
And I think there's just an incredible risk of hospitalization in nursing home.

2377
04:34:08.500 --> 04:34:17.500
And just the reality is that we have heard stories of people who've died while waiting for services.

2378
04:34:17.500 --> 04:34:24.000
And I think if you asked case managers, you would hear these stories.

2379
04:34:24.000 --> 04:34:48.000
And then the reality is this, home care providers are either limiting the number of CFI clients they can accept because they're losing tens of thousands of dollars a year or more, six figures a year providing this service, or they're quietly just ceasing participation in the program.

2380
04:34:48.000 --> 04:34:59.000
They're saying we can't take any more, we'll serve the clients we have, or we're going to transfer them to another provider.

2381
04:34:59.000 --> 04:35:03.000
And that's the reality of what's going on.

2382
04:35:03.000 --> 04:35:08.500
And then lastly, so what can you do from finance committee?

2383
04:35:08.500 --> 04:35:31.000
I think it's important for you to know that between 2017 and 2020, I requested data from the department and it showed me that just in CFI home health services alone, that between 11 million to $15 million a year were unspent in the budget.

2384
04:35:31.000 --> 04:35:47.500
And what I'm saying is, what I mean by that is the department authorized services and based on unit of services, the amount of services that they authorized had a specific dollar amount.

2385
04:35:47.500 --> 04:36:00.500
And when you look at how many claims were really paid out for services delivered, that each year between 11 and 15 million dollars was unspent.

2386
04:36:00.500 --> 04:36:04.500
So that money lapses to the general fund.

2387
04:36:04.500 --> 04:36:15.000
I don't believe that it lapses in the middle of the biennium, but it lapses at the end of the biennium.

2388
04:36:15.000 --> 04:36:20.000
So we are using budgeted funds to fill the laps.

2389
04:36:20.000 --> 04:36:31.500
And instead, the department could be using those to increase the rates to market level in order to stabilize the delivery of services.

2390
04:36:31.500 --> 04:36:36.000
So I'm not here asking you for more money.

2391
04:36:36.000 --> 04:36:46.500
I'm saying the department should not be leaving money on the table and budget and lapsing it to the general fund.

2392
04:36:46.500 --> 04:36:50.500
It should be used, put into rate increases.

2393
04:36:50.500 --> 04:36:53.500
And I realize there's a catch-22.

2394
04:36:53.500 --> 04:37:04.000
you could say, well, if we increase the rates and more services that are delivered, then we'll spend overspend the line.

2395
04:37:04.000 --> 04:37:13.500
I don't think you're going to get to 100% of authorized services anytime soon, even with increasing the rates.

2396
04:37:13.500 --> 04:37:20.000
But maybe you could get to 85 or 95% of services being delivered.

2397
04:37:20.000 --> 04:37:26.500
That would be a much safer situation for people who depend on CFI.

2398
04:37:26.500 --> 04:37:35.500
The legislature should really direct the department to further increase the home health rates within the proposed appropriation.

2399
04:37:35.500 --> 04:37:47.000
And I think, I know that Deb mentioned in the home health realm that it would be for personal care providers and homemakers.

2400
04:37:47.000 --> 04:37:53.500
I think you really need to increase home health aid rates as well.

2401
04:37:53.500 --> 04:38:03.000
These are the services that are most frequently used, and this is where there are major gaps in care.

2402
04:38:03.000 --> 04:38:08.500
And so I would really urge you to look at that.

2403
04:38:08.500 --> 04:38:20.500
And I think the rates should be as high as the Title 20 and 3B rates and even closer to the private market rates.

2404
04:38:20.500 --> 04:38:33.500
The other thing that I would recommend is that the state consider adopting a footnote similar to the nursing home footnote that's currently in the budget.

2405
04:38:33.500 --> 04:38:39.500
And if you'd like, I would direct you back to page 551.

2406
04:38:39.500 --> 04:38:57.500
There is a footnote for nursing homes that says that at the end of the fiscal year, that any money that is left in the line is paid out to providers as a one-time rate enhancement.

2407
04:38:57.500 --> 04:39:08.000
And I think that that would get to the $11 million to $15 million dollars that's not being spent a year.

2408
04:39:08.000 --> 04:39:12.500
I think this is something you should really consider.

2409
04:39:12.500 --> 04:39:33.500
And then lastly, you should know that in the federal stimulus bill that was passed by the House, by Congress and passed by the Senate, and now is going back to the House for consideration and eventually going to President Biden's desk.

2410
04:39:33.500 --> 04:39:46.500
It includes a 10% federal match increase for home and community-based services for April 1st through, I have another typo there, through March 31st of 2022.

2411
04:39:46.500 --> 04:40:00.000
So for a year, there will be more federal dollars coming into the state for these services and other services like Medicaid, state plan, home health services.

2412
04:40:00.000 --> 04:40:03.500
And these funds cannot supplant existing funds.

2413
04:40:03.500 --> 04:40:07.500
They have to be used to strengthen programs.

2414
04:40:07.500 --> 04:40:13.500
So there should be more money in the budget to increase rates.

2415
04:40:13.500 --> 04:40:22.000
So those are some of the things that I hope that you will discuss in your committee.

2416
04:40:22.000 --> 04:40:25.000
And this is my contact information.

2417
04:40:25.000 --> 04:40:29.500
I'm happy to take any questions that you have.

2418
04:40:29.500 --> 04:40:35.500
Also, Henry Veyu from She and Finney Capital Group is our lobbyist.

2419
04:40:35.500 --> 04:40:43.500
And I know many of you you know Henry and you can reach out to him.

2420
04:40:43.500 --> 04:41:03.500
And lastly, you know, these keep in mind, I know that you're the committee that deals with numbers, but just remember there are real people out there living in homes, relying on services, and depending on the state for care.

2421
04:41:03.500 --> 04:41:19.000
And I think we can't ever lose sight that every one of these people has a story and their story is an important story and the services they receive are important.

2422
04:41:19.000 --> 04:41:25.000
So with that, I'm going to stop sharing and take any questions.

2423
04:41:25.000 --> 04:41:29.500
And I don't know how I did on time.

2424
04:41:29.500 --> 04:41:31.500
Sorry.

2425
04:41:31.500 --> 04:41:34.500
So, well, this is Mary Jane.

2426
04:41:34.500 --> 04:41:43.500
I don't know if representative Edwards wants me to go and you went a little over your time.

2427
04:41:43.500 --> 04:41:48.500
So I don't know if there are questions or not.

2428
04:41:48.500 --> 04:41:57.500
I don't hear any so I think maybe representative Edwards, would you like us to move on now?

2429
04:41:57.500 --> 04:41:59.500
Sure.

2430
04:41:59.500 --> 04:42:04.000
Thank you so much for the opportunity to speak.

2431
04:42:04.000 --> 04:42:07.500
Thank you for the really great presentation.

2432
04:42:07.500 --> 04:42:09.500
Thank you, Gina.

2433
04:42:09.500 --> 04:42:16.500
I just want to say it was a very powerful presentation, very well delivered.

2434
04:42:16.500 --> 04:42:22.500
I appreciated your use of common language to just make clear points.

2435
04:42:22.500 --> 04:42:24.500
Thank you.

2436
04:42:24.500 --> 04:42:26.500
Thank you.

2437
04:42:26.500 --> 04:42:32.000
Do you want me to go on with the next one?

2438
04:42:32.000 --> 04:42:34.000
Please.

2439
04:42:34.000 --> 04:42:36.000
Okay.

2440
04:42:36.000 --> 04:42:40.000
I think next maybe we'll have Jackie Cowell.

2441
04:42:40.000 --> 04:42:49.500
She's from Early Learning New Hampshire and she's going to speak a little bit about the child care budget.

2442
04:42:49.500 --> 04:42:56.000
And I can tell you it can be found in your budget book.

2443
04:42:56.000 --> 04:43:08.500
I think she's going to speak about she's going to speak about the child care budget, which is on page 950 of your budget book.

2444
04:43:08.500 --> 04:43:14.000
And it's employment related child childcare and protective and preventive childcare.

2445
04:43:14.000 --> 04:43:16.000
And so Jackie Cowell.

2446
04:43:16.000 --> 04:43:18.000
I'll keep time.

2447
04:43:18.000 --> 04:43:20.000
Okay.

2448
04:43:20.000 --> 04:43:25.500
I think Jackie's presentation might be a little shorter than Gina's.

2449
04:43:25.500 --> 04:43:30.500
Oh, I think maybe I brought in the wrong person.

2450
04:43:30.500 --> 04:43:32.500
Hold on.

2451
04:43:32.500 --> 04:43:34.500
It's C-O-W-E-L-L.

2452
04:43:34.500 --> 04:43:36.500
I think.

2453
04:43:36.500 --> 04:43:39.000
Okay, she's coming in now.

2454
04:43:39.000 --> 04:43:41.000
Okay.

2455
04:43:41.000 --> 04:43:43.000
How do you do?

2456
04:43:43.000 --> 04:43:45.000
Hi, Jackie.

2457
04:43:45.000 --> 04:43:47.000
Hi.

2458
04:43:47.000 --> 04:43:50.500
Good afternoon, committee members of Division three.

2459
04:43:50.500 --> 04:43:57.500
I'm very excited to be here talking with you about the child care budget.

2460
04:43:57.500 --> 04:44:03.500
There are two lines that I'd like to talk with you about.

2461
04:44:03.500 --> 04:44:09.500
Kevin, I don't have a presentation, so we'll just have a conversation.

2462
04:44:09.500 --> 04:44:23.500
but if you don't mind if you wanted me to share my screen and point to the budget but it is as Mary Jane indicated it's it's 950.

2463
04:44:23.500 --> 04:44:29.000
And the two lines, it's under account 2977 Child Development Program.

2464
04:44:29.000 --> 04:44:44.000
And the two lines that I'm going to be talking about are class 536, towards the bottom of the page, employment-related child care, and 564, protective and preventive child care.

2465
04:44:44.000 --> 04:44:59.500
So I just wanted to tell you about what those programs are designed to do and to talk about what needs to, what we believe needs to happen in those lines.

2466
04:44:59.500 --> 04:45:08.000
and so employment-related child care, I'll start with class 536, again towards the bottom of the page.

2467
04:45:08.000 --> 04:45:21.000
As you might have seen in the budget, during this biennium, there are $30 million in the first year and $34 million in the second year.

2468
04:45:21.000 --> 04:45:39.500
And the governor is proposing, as the department also proposed, cutting that down to 26 million in the first year of the next biennium and actually a little bit less in the second year of the biennium.

2469
04:45:39.500 --> 04:45:41.500
That's a significant cut.

2470
04:45:41.500 --> 04:45:44.500
And here's what this program does.

2471
04:45:44.500 --> 04:45:47.000
This is employment-related child care.

2472
04:45:47.000 --> 04:45:52.500
These are families, parents that are working who have young children.

2473
04:45:52.500 --> 04:46:07.000
So children anywhere from a baby all the way through age 12 might be going to an after-school program who are income eligible to receive state child care assistance.

2474
04:46:07.000 --> 04:46:19.000
The purpose of this program is to give them enough assistance so they can keep working and then lift themselves out of state assistance.

2475
04:46:19.000 --> 04:46:27.000
And I used to run a child care program and others, Mary Jane used to others.

2476
04:46:27.000 --> 04:46:40.000
We've seen story after story of families who use this one bit of state assistance to get ahead and to get off of state assistance completely.

2477
04:46:40.000 --> 04:46:56.000
What we do find is when and if there is a wait list and they cannot get these subsidies, these scholarships, that they often become eligible for higher levels of state assistance.

2478
04:46:56.000 --> 04:47:08.500
And so this is a really terrific measure to make sure that they have what they need to keep working and to keep getting ahead.

2479
04:47:08.500 --> 04:47:14.500
And so we at Early Learning New Hampshire, we're a statewide nonprofit.

2480
04:47:14.500 --> 04:47:24.500
We're quite concerned with this potential cut and the potential need for a wait list if these funds run out.

2481
04:47:24.500 --> 04:47:28.000
We're worried these are not sufficient funds.

2482
04:47:28.000 --> 04:47:38.500
Historically, over time, there have been fluctuations in the number of folks who come, who are eligible, who use these services.

2483
04:47:38.500 --> 04:47:49.000
It can be as low as 3,000 and some, and then 5,000 and 6,000 during the recession in 2008 and 2009.

2484
04:47:49.000 --> 04:47:59.000
It was over 8,000, over 8,000 children whose families were income eligible using working families, using this child care assistance.

2485
04:47:59.000 --> 04:48:01.000
It's a bit unpredictable.

2486
04:48:01.000 --> 04:48:06.500
It's extremely unpredictable right now, we maintain, because of the pandemic.

2487
04:48:06.500 --> 04:48:22.500
It's highly likely, we know that there are a lot of folks who are obviously on unemployment right now, who therefore will be looking for job search when they can go back.

2488
04:48:22.500 --> 04:48:27.000
They'll be eligible for the state child care assistance.

2489
04:48:27.000 --> 04:48:30.500
So again, it could be more families.

2490
04:48:30.500 --> 04:48:36.000
There are some folks who are now not working full time.

2491
04:48:36.000 --> 04:48:38.000
It's so unpredictable.

2492
04:48:38.000 --> 04:48:51.000
We urge you to look at what mechanisms could be in place to have enough money to make sure that we don't start a wait list.

2493
04:48:51.000 --> 04:48:55.500
And so that's what I urge you to do.

2494
04:48:55.500 --> 04:49:04.000
I can't sit here and say, I know there's going to be these many children next year.

2495
04:49:04.000 --> 04:49:06.500
It's really hard to predict.

2496
04:49:06.500 --> 04:49:33.500
So I know that if you all can think of a footnote, if you all can think of a mechanism, whatever that is, to think of using some of the funds as a set aside to ensure that if it looks like there's a wait list, to make sure that the funds are there.

2497
04:49:33.500 --> 04:49:42.000
Because without those funds, it is highly likely they'll be eligible for higher levels of state assistance.

2498
04:49:42.000 --> 04:49:50.500
Many of these families that are in this income category, they don't have the choice to telework.

2499
04:49:50.500 --> 04:49:54.000
You know, they are certified nurse's assistants.

2500
04:49:54.000 --> 04:50:00.500
They are working at Wendy's, they are working at grocery stores, et cetera.

2501
04:50:00.500 --> 04:50:04.000
They have to be on the job.

2502
04:50:04.000 --> 04:50:10.000
So therefore having the childcare is critical for them to keep working.

2503
04:50:10.000 --> 04:50:14.500
So again, we urge you to look at that.

2504
04:50:14.500 --> 04:50:26.000
You may have heard that women have been the ones that have the highest job losses during the pandemic, very much more significant.

2505
04:50:26.000 --> 04:50:34.500
And so again, folks with young children, we really urge you to look at this line item.

2506
04:50:34.500 --> 04:50:42.500
The other thing I'd ask you to look at is the line of the class 564.

2507
04:50:42.500 --> 04:50:46.000
So that's protective and preventive child care.

2508
04:50:46.000 --> 04:51:11.500
So right below line 536 employment related child care that we ask you to please think of a way to have sufficient money because the last thing we need in New Hampshire is a wait list for folks who are working to be able to have the child care they need.

2509
04:51:11.500 --> 04:51:18.500
But the protective and preventive is there for a bit of a different reason.

2510
04:51:18.500 --> 04:51:24.000
As you see in the lines, it's $2 million a year.

2511
04:51:24.000 --> 04:51:35.500
The department had asked for an extra $2 million a year because they have actually seen more and more children eligible for this.

2512
04:51:35.500 --> 04:51:39.500
There are two reasons folks use the service.

2513
04:51:39.500 --> 04:51:46.000
One is a family might be deemed at risk of abuse and neglect.

2514
04:51:46.000 --> 04:51:51.000
So they receive child care services to support the family.

2515
04:51:51.000 --> 04:51:56.000
There also may be cases of child abuse and neglect.

2516
04:51:56.000 --> 04:51:58.000
That's the protective.

2517
04:51:58.000 --> 04:52:06.000
And again, those foster families and others, our relatives are using the child care as well.

2518
04:52:06.000 --> 04:52:21.500
So my really quick request is for you to have a discussion about what it would take to make sure we don't have a wait list in employment related child care..

2519
04:52:21.500 --> 04:52:47.000
We are quite concerned the $26 million is not sufficient for what will be needed over the biennium, and to ask to put an extra, as the department asked, $2 million a year in the protective and preventive child care line to make sure that those children are served as well.

2520
04:52:47.000 --> 04:52:49.000
And that's my presentation.

2521
04:52:49.000 --> 04:52:55.500
And I urge you to look at those slides and have that discussion.

2522
04:52:55.500 --> 04:53:00.500
And I'd love to answer any questions you might have.

2523
04:53:00.500 --> 04:53:02.500
Thank you, Jackie.

2524
04:53:02.500 --> 04:53:04.500
Are there questions?

2525
04:53:04.500 --> 04:53:07.500
I can't do the hands up.

2526
04:53:07.500 --> 04:53:09.500
So are there quick?

2527
04:53:09.500 --> 04:53:15.000
I just want to know if you're the more interesting cousin.

2528
04:53:15.000 --> 04:53:17.000
Simon.

2529
04:53:17.000 --> 04:53:19.000
No, unfortunately, no.

2530
04:53:19.000 --> 04:53:21.000
Thank you, though.

2531
04:53:21.000 --> 04:53:23.500
So thank you so much.

2532
04:53:23.500 --> 04:53:27.500
I appreciate your listening and I thank you.

2533
04:53:27.500 --> 04:53:29.500
Great.

2534
04:53:29.500 --> 04:53:31.500
Thank you, Jackie.

2535
04:53:31.500 --> 04:53:33.500
You're welcome.

2536
04:53:33.500 --> 04:53:37.500
So I think we're probably back on time.

2537
04:53:37.500 --> 04:53:41.000
Thank you for getting back on track.

2538
04:53:41.000 --> 04:53:45.000
And now I believe Maura O'Neill coming in.

2539
04:53:45.000 --> 04:53:49.000
And she is the New Hampshire child advocate.

2540
04:53:49.000 --> 04:53:53.000
I believe we have Maura O'Neill coming in.

2541
04:53:53.000 --> 04:53:57.000
And she is the New Hampshire child advocate.

2542
04:53:57.000 --> 04:54:02.500
And I think she's going to talk about the Sununu Center.

2543
04:54:02.500 --> 04:54:04.500
OK, she's coming in.

2544
04:54:04.500 --> 04:54:06.500
Thank you, Kevin.

2545
04:54:06.500 --> 04:54:08.500
Good afternoon.

2546
04:54:08.500 --> 04:54:11.000
Can you all hear me?

2547
04:54:11.000 --> 04:54:13.500
Yes, we can hear you.

2548
04:54:13.500 --> 04:54:15.500
Great.

2549
04:54:15.500 --> 04:54:17.500
Mr.

2550
04:54:17.500 --> 04:54:24.500
Chairman and members of the committee, thank you for the invitation to speak today.

2551
04:54:24.500 --> 04:54:26.500
Mr.

2552
04:54:26.500 --> 04:54:35.500
Ripple does have my slides, or do you want me to try to share the ones I have?

2553
04:54:35.500 --> 04:54:44.000
If you can share, I think that would be best, but if not, I can do it.

2554
04:54:44.000 --> 04:54:46.000
How's that?

2555
04:54:46.000 --> 04:54:48.000
Have you got them?

2556
04:54:48.000 --> 04:54:50.000
Yes.

2557
04:54:50.000 --> 04:54:53.000
Let's show in from the beginning.

2558
04:54:53.000 --> 04:54:55.000
So there we go.

2559
04:54:55.000 --> 04:54:57.000
Thank you.

2560
04:54:57.000 --> 04:55:06.500
So I was asked to come in and speak a little bit about the Sununu Youth Services Center today.

2561
04:55:06.500 --> 04:55:18.000
There's been some discussion about closing the facility which has become very expensive to run for the number of children that it serves.

2562
04:55:18.000 --> 04:55:30.500
And I do think it's sort of breathtaking to look at the size of the complex and think about today there are 13 children there.

2563
04:55:30.500 --> 04:55:35.000
Two of them are from the state of Maine.

2564
04:55:35.000 --> 04:55:39.500
So essentially we have 11 New Hampshire children there.

2565
04:55:39.500 --> 04:55:43.500
And so I'm happy to talk about this.

2566
04:55:43.500 --> 04:55:53.000
And I also want to preface this conversation with recognizing that we have to have this conversation with care.

2567
04:55:53.000 --> 04:55:58.000
There are 90 people who are employed in that facility.

2568
04:55:58.000 --> 04:56:03.500
They go to work every day and do their best job.

2569
04:56:03.500 --> 04:56:07.500
They work under a great deal of stress.

2570
04:56:07.500 --> 04:56:16.500
And probably the biggest source of stress that they experience is these kinds of public conversations about them.

2571
04:56:16.500 --> 04:56:26.500
So I just want to be very careful about how we can make these considerations and be respectful of that.

2572
04:56:26.500 --> 04:56:37.000
Largely also because when a staff are stressed out, that affects children very much and even can be dangerous for children.

2573
04:56:37.000 --> 04:56:56.500
So I understand that the interest of time, I'm not going to go too deeply into background, but I did want to sort of set the stage for your thinking when you're making decisions like changing services for children.

2574
04:56:56.500 --> 04:57:10.000
And in particular, this is essentially the idea of closing down a prison for children, which is a movement that's been happening across the country fairly extensively.

2575
04:57:10.000 --> 04:57:30.000
And what we've seen since 1992, when the first juvenile detention alternatives initiatives started in Florida, was that children are actually harmed a bit when they go into incarceration, and they also are not effective programs to keep communities safe.

2576
04:57:30.000 --> 04:57:40.000
The most highly predictive factor of a child offending a second time is being in this system to begin with.

2577
04:57:40.000 --> 04:57:55.000
And we've also since then learned a lot about children's brains, and I'd love to give you a whole lecture about what that means when we talk about brain development.

2578
04:57:55.000 --> 04:58:03.500
And I'm happy to come back and do that at some point when you have more time.

2579
04:58:03.500 --> 04:58:18.000
But that has really sort of driven a lot of what we've known about where we put children, how we think about the things that we do with them.

2580
04:58:18.000 --> 04:58:40.500
And as we examine what are the best kinds of services for them, we've seen a shift in New Hampshire itself, building out the system of care, transforming the way we use the Sununu Center, starting with HB 517 that shifted who was admitted there.

2581
04:58:40.500 --> 04:58:44.500
And that's how we got to this place.

2582
04:58:44.500 --> 04:58:47.500
And this is a national trend.

2583
04:58:47.500 --> 04:58:55.500
We're seeing significantly that fewer and fewer children are being arrested and brought into juvenile systems.

2584
04:58:55.500 --> 04:58:58.500
This is a really good indicator.

2585
04:58:58.500 --> 04:59:07.500
Right now, as I mentioned to you today, there are 13 children at the Sununi Youth Services Center.

2586
04:59:07.500 --> 04:59:13.500
There's actually about a little over 1,700 children who are adjudicated delinquent.

2587
04:59:13.500 --> 04:59:17.500
Most of them are served in the community.

2588
04:59:17.500 --> 04:59:21.500
It's a very small population that are incarcerated.

2589
04:59:21.500 --> 04:59:36.000
And I include the number of children who are in residential placements because in some ways, you know, courts order children to these placements as an alternative to incarceration.

2590
04:59:36.000 --> 04:59:44.500
And there are some of the similar concerns about kids who are in those environments as well.

2591
04:59:44.500 --> 04:59:56.000
Right now, there are 39 children who are delinquent, adjudicated delinquent in the state, and 13 who have been sent out of state.

2592
04:59:56.000 --> 05:00:01.500
Many of the kids who are out of state are girls.

2593
05:00:01.500 --> 05:00:10.500
Of the 11 children that are at the Sununu Center today, two are detained and nine are committed.

2594
05:00:10.500 --> 05:00:15.500
We use the same facility for both detention and commitment.

2595
05:00:15.500 --> 05:00:23.500
At least two of the children are awaiting placement options for foster care or residential programming.

2596
05:00:23.500 --> 05:00:25.500
There are probably more.

2597
05:00:25.500 --> 05:00:34.500
It's our opinion that most of the children who are there could be treated safely in the community.

2598
05:00:34.500 --> 05:00:48.000
There are eight children there at police who have combined history with 82 abuse and neglect referrals ranging from seven for one child to 31 for another.

2599
05:00:48.000 --> 05:00:52.500
So these are the crossover children that we see.

2600
05:00:52.500 --> 05:01:20.000
They're children who have lived through abuse and neglect and the behavior that manifests because of their treatment and their adverse childhood experiences ends up being involved with law enforcement and adjudicated and sometimes just brought over to the juvenile system in order to get them the idea that they're getting some sort of help.

2601
05:01:20.000 --> 05:01:26.500
There are three children also who've had child in need of services cases.

2602
05:01:26.500 --> 05:01:34.000
Those are children who have behavioral issues that they can't get services any other way.

2603
05:01:34.000 --> 05:01:39.500
There are four that have been in multiple residential programs already.

2604
05:01:39.500 --> 05:01:45.000
And there are six who are there because of parole violations.

2605
05:01:45.000 --> 05:01:50.500
So that is the recidivism that you see people coming back.

2606
05:01:50.500 --> 05:02:09.000
So one of the quick things I'll just say, since I can't lecture you entirely on brain development, is some of the things that we need to think about when we think about where we're putting children.

2607
05:02:09.000 --> 05:02:24.500
We all have become in New Hampshire really sort of expert about being responsive to trauma and understanding what happens to children when they have been traumatized or adverse childhood experiences.

2608
05:02:24.500 --> 05:02:39.500
But the other side of that that we need to be thinking about is how to heal children, what will make them healthy and get their development back on track.

2609
05:02:39.500 --> 05:02:53.000
So there are four sort of pillars of hope that Robert Zaghi and his colleagues use to describe the important things that will help children be successful.

2610
05:02:53.000 --> 05:03:04.500
One is that consistent caring adult, an adult who is committed to a child and the child feels they have that strong relationship.

2611
05:03:04.500 --> 05:03:15.500
The next is to live, play, and learn in a safe, stable environment and not to be in fear all the time.

2612
05:03:15.500 --> 05:03:22.000
And then the third is to feel that you belong to a community.

2613
05:03:22.000 --> 05:03:32.000
So it's really important when you move kids away from a community, they lose that and they don't feel valued.

2614
05:03:32.000 --> 05:03:36.000
You want to have that sense of belonging.

2615
05:03:36.000 --> 05:03:49.000
And then finally, to be given the skills to be able to manage their emotions in a healthy way, which is how they'll manage their behaviors.

2616
05:03:49.000 --> 05:04:05.000
So it's been very difficult to talk with folks about considering closing down a youth prison and right now in the United States because New Hampshire is so far ahead of everyone.

2617
05:04:05.000 --> 05:04:14.000
I mean, there really are a lot of eyes on this state for the progress that we've made.

2618
05:04:14.000 --> 05:04:19.500
And I know for many people, it doesn't feel that way.

2619
05:04:19.500 --> 05:04:44.000
But the idea of trying to resolve an issue of 11 kids who are in a facility is almost sort of adorable to many of the states around us who are dealing with hundreds of kids, and they consider themselves fully transformed and doing different ways of juvenile justice.

2620
05:04:44.000 --> 05:04:55.000
But when you have conversations with them, they'll tell you before you close the facility, you have to have all these things.

2621
05:04:55.000 --> 05:05:07.500
And all of the things they mentioned are things that we either have, or we're in the process, thanks to Senate Bill 14 from 2019.

2622
05:05:07.500 --> 05:05:21.000
The mobile crisis response that not just helps kids at home, but actually goes to schools and where a lot of offenses come from the school environment.

2623
05:05:21.000 --> 05:05:25.500
So instead of police responding, you have clinicians responding.

2624
05:05:25.500 --> 05:05:37.500
These expanded wraparound care coordinating services that work with families and children to help them manage issues at home so that minimizes behavioral problems.

2625
05:05:37.500 --> 05:05:50.500
We have an RFP out right now for multisystemic therapy, which is the most evidence-based intensive program for children to keep them out of incarcerated situations.

2626
05:05:50.500 --> 05:06:02.500
MST for about the average length of stay is three to four months for about, I think it's up to $15,000 roundabout per child.

2627
05:06:02.500 --> 05:06:14.500
And there are evidences that not only will that child not re-offend, but that child's siblings won't offend and the child's parents won't offend.

2628
05:06:14.500 --> 05:06:17.000
It's a really exceptional program.

2629
05:06:17.000 --> 05:06:21.500
We're very excited that it's coming to New Hampshire.

2630
05:06:21.500 --> 05:06:47.500
And the care management entities and the comprehensive assessment treatment, these are essentially they're independent bodies who are going to be looking at kids, assessing their needs and matching them to services so that they don't end up just placed randomly in residential care that's not really designed to meet their needs.

2631
05:06:47.500 --> 05:06:54.500
And they're going to be watching them to make sure that they're making progress.

2632
05:06:54.500 --> 05:07:11.500
So it's when children are placed someplace for care and it's not adequate for them that they start sliding and they end up in an assaultive situation and end up at the Sununu Center.

2633
05:07:11.500 --> 05:07:36.500
And there's also an RFP out for actual procured residential services that will be under contract for the first time so that we can hold providers accountable to provide services that are effective and that meet children's needs and that children move on rapidly to get back to their community.

2634
05:07:36.500 --> 05:07:42.000
So they have that sense of belonging and maintaining those relationships.

2635
05:07:42.000 --> 05:07:46.000
And there's also a whole probation transformation happening.

2636
05:07:46.000 --> 05:08:05.000
And there's a bill, Senate Bill 94, I think, that would that would have the law enforcement when they encounter a child who's broken the law, can refer them to the department for an assessment of their needs.

2637
05:08:05.000 --> 05:08:18.500
And if we discover that their needs would, if they were met, would also mitigate the risk to the community, then they never get petitions for adjudication.

2638
05:08:18.500 --> 05:08:24.500
They just go right to whatever service is going to help them.

2639
05:08:24.500 --> 05:08:27.000
So I'm mentioning these things.

2640
05:08:27.000 --> 05:08:49.000
I know you've heard a lot about some of them in the conversations with the department the last couple of weeks, but I'm mentioning these in the context of, this is gonna drive a more diminishing rate of children coming into the Sununu Center.

2641
05:08:49.000 --> 05:08:53.500
It's almost gonna empty out just sort of organically.

2642
05:08:53.500 --> 05:09:08.500
But we know that people believe that we still need some alternative when we have to, when we have a child that we need to keep safe from the community.

2643
05:09:08.500 --> 05:09:23.000
And so we propose the two models that we spent the last week really talking to experts around the country to see, you know, what are the best models.

2644
05:09:23.000 --> 05:09:34.000
And one is the Missouri model style secure bed or 12 to 14 bed secure home and this multidimensional treatment foster care.

2645
05:09:34.000 --> 05:09:38.500
I'll tell you a little bit more about these.

2646
05:09:38.500 --> 05:09:48.000
So the Missouri model, which has been around for a while and it's been somewhat modified as they go.

2647
05:09:48.000 --> 05:09:53.000
We are suggesting a 12 to 14 bed secure facility.

2648
05:09:53.000 --> 05:09:59.000
We don't think you're going to actually need 12 to 14 beds.

2649
05:09:59.000 --> 05:10:16.000
You're probably going to need five to six, but there seems to be a sense in the community that you have to be prepared and there's some political expedience around getting something set up.

2650
05:10:16.000 --> 05:10:19.000
So we would go with that.

2651
05:10:19.000 --> 05:10:22.500
It would accommodate any possible census fluctuations.

2652
05:10:22.500 --> 05:10:39.500
It also is required to be, the whole model is around being home-like and normal so that children are, you know, feel like they're living a normal life and that encourages them to flourish.

2653
05:10:39.500 --> 05:10:45.500
There's a treatment milieu that emphasizes rehabilitation and really healthy child development.

2654
05:10:45.500 --> 05:10:49.500
So I know the chairman asked Thank you.

2655
05:10:49.500 --> 05:10:55.500
There's a treatment milieu that emphasizes rehabilitation and really healthy child development.

2656
05:10:55.500 --> 05:11:06.500
So I know the chairman asked for some details in money, like what would it cost to run these sort of things?

2657
05:11:06.500 --> 05:11:11.000
So we looked at two separate models right now.

2658
05:11:11.000 --> 05:11:15.000
Vermont is in the middle of building one.

2659
05:11:15.000 --> 05:11:19.000
And I know that you heard from Mr.

2660
05:11:19.000 --> 05:11:25.000
John DeJoy last week who gave you a copy of their proposal.

2661
05:11:25.000 --> 05:11:29.000
The Vermont is building a six bed facility.

2662
05:11:29.000 --> 05:11:38.500
And you can see that they've got, they're fairly heavy in management positions for that facility, six of them.

2663
05:11:38.500 --> 05:11:41.000
They have three clinical staff.

2664
05:11:41.000 --> 05:11:47.000
They have direct care workers, 28 of them, and direct care support.

2665
05:11:47.000 --> 05:12:04.500
And so their costs right now are the cost of operating for the year and also construction costs, which seems high, but it's still under what you're paying right now at the Sun Union Center.

2666
05:12:04.500 --> 05:12:07.000
On the left is Massachusetts.

2667
05:12:07.000 --> 05:12:13.500
They have a whole series of different sized group homes and different configurations.

2668
05:12:13.500 --> 05:12:18.500
They may be, many of them are operated by nonprofits.

2669
05:12:18.500 --> 05:12:28.500
It's under statute in New Hampshire that all residential programs that are contracted out must be contracted with nonprofit agencies.

2670
05:12:28.500 --> 05:12:32.500
And some of these are in state-owned facilities.

2671
05:12:32.500 --> 05:12:36.500
Some of them are owned by the nonprofit.

2672
05:12:36.500 --> 05:12:44.000
So I just chose this one just to give you a sense of the cost.

2673
05:12:44.000 --> 05:12:47.500
This is for 12 to 14 children.

2674
05:12:47.500 --> 05:12:52.500
They have a slightly fewer direct management staffing, 2.15 FTEs.

2675
05:12:52.500 --> 05:12:55.000
They have three clinical roles.

2676
05:12:55.000 --> 05:12:58.000
They have 20 direct care staffing.

2677
05:12:58.000 --> 05:13:05.500
And then their direct care support staffing would be like the maintenance and the cook.

2678
05:13:05.500 --> 05:13:14.000
And then they have some other funds that go into covering the cost of running the place.

2679
05:13:14.000 --> 05:13:24.500
These aren't entirely comparable to what you want to do because they don't, it's not clear where some items are covered.

2680
05:13:24.500 --> 05:13:30.500
And in particular, the Massachusetts model doesn't include education or health care.

2681
05:13:30.500 --> 05:13:34.000
The Vermont model does include a teacher.

2682
05:13:34.000 --> 05:13:43.500
So Massachusetts has a really interesting model and it works very well for them because of a Thank you.

2683
05:13:43.500 --> 05:13:46.000
model does include a teacher.

2684
05:13:46.000 --> 05:14:11.000
So Massachusetts has a really interesting model, and it works very well for them because of economy of scale, but they actually have an independent school, sort of without walls, that gives the state the ability to control the curriculum and make sure that teachers are licensed and adequately prepared.

2685
05:14:11.000 --> 05:14:15.500
And they embed teachers in all their group homes.

2686
05:14:15.500 --> 05:14:30.000
And that would work really well here, except for that we don't have as many group homes unless we expanded the service to some of the existing residential services.

2687
05:14:30.000 --> 05:14:43.500
It's really an interesting model, especially in New Hampshire where we're interested in charter schools to come up with a separate school without walls that serves folks.

2688
05:14:43.500 --> 05:14:49.000
And that kept some continuity of kids if they moved around.

2689
05:14:49.000 --> 05:14:59.000
And they also contract with a health care service regionally that provides health care to all of their group homes.

2690
05:14:59.000 --> 05:15:04.500
So those would still be issues we'd need to think about.

2691
05:15:04.500 --> 05:15:10.500
It's very difficult to calculate out the projected costs for New Hampshire.

2692
05:15:10.500 --> 05:15:20.500
Again, as I mentioned, their population is so small that it's very difficult to figure out how it would translate.

2693
05:15:20.500 --> 05:15:30.500
The second model that we propose as an alternative to incarceration and residential placement is the multi-dimensional treatment foster care.

2694
05:15:30.500 --> 05:15:34.500
This would actually complement the secure 12-bed facility.

2695
05:15:34.500 --> 05:15:45.000
It's a really interesting, very intensive therapeutic foster home that's designed specifically for adolescents who are delinquent or have emotional disturbances.

2696
05:15:45.000 --> 05:15:54.000
So the kids who would otherwise be incarcerated, depending upon their offenses and also depending upon their needs.

2697
05:15:54.000 --> 05:15:58.000
The foster parents receive exceptional training and support.

2698
05:15:58.000 --> 05:16:01.000
There's basically a wraparound with them.

2699
05:16:01.000 --> 05:16:07.000
The treatment in this model is both the child and the parents.

2700
05:16:07.000 --> 05:16:17.000
So stays range between five and 15 months at a cost of roughly about $25,000 to $35,000 per young person.

2701
05:16:17.000 --> 05:16:22.000
This also is very evidence-based and has really good outcomes.

2702
05:16:22.000 --> 05:16:27.000
There are exceptional rates as well for the foster parents.

2703
05:16:27.000 --> 05:16:32.000
I think in Massachusetts, they use a model like this.

2704
05:16:32.000 --> 05:16:36.000
They limit to two children per foster home.

2705
05:16:36.000 --> 05:16:46.000
But a lot of the young people that we see in the system, they don't do well in congregate settings.

2706
05:16:46.000 --> 05:16:56.500
Many of them, either because of their trauma or developmental conditions, have hypersensitivities to crowds, to noise, to textures and things.

2707
05:16:56.500 --> 05:17:02.000
And so many of them do much better in foster care.

2708
05:17:02.000 --> 05:17:17.000
But if you have foster parents who are really trained and prepared to take care of them and keep the community safe at the same time, it's a nice model.

2709
05:17:17.000 --> 05:17:22.000
So I know that when I spoke to you, Mr.

2710
05:17:22.000 --> 05:17:33.500
Chair, you were interested in the option of really cutting costs and closing the building and sending that money back to the taxpayer.

2711
05:17:33.500 --> 05:17:56.000
But all of the states that have gone through this sort of transformation, it's been very important that they have reserved the funds for the first few years and reinvested it to make sure that there's a system that's going to thoroughly support the transformation.

2712
05:17:56.000 --> 05:18:09.000
And I'll point out Connecticut, where they were really visibly making all sorts of plans and fighting hard to close their facility for over 20 years.

2713
05:18:09.000 --> 05:18:17.500
And then when they did close it, they just closed it and they didn't have a plan.

2714
05:18:17.500 --> 05:18:28.500
They moved all the money elsewhere and they have a lot of kids now in really very dire situation in detention facilities.

2715
05:18:28.500 --> 05:18:34.000
And so we really do not need to make that commitment.

2716
05:18:34.000 --> 05:18:38.500
So two sort of reinvestment funds that are important.

2717
05:18:38.500 --> 05:18:45.500
One is to enhance the system, to support the kids in these new models.

2718
05:18:45.500 --> 05:18:48.000
Intensive mentoring is absolutely critical.

2719
05:18:48.000 --> 05:18:51.500
It's also evidence-based that kids do better.

2720
05:18:51.500 --> 05:18:56.500
And that goes back to what I told you about.

2721
05:18:56.500 --> 05:19:05.500
One of the factors in kids recovering and their resilience is having a single care and consistent adult.

2722
05:19:05.500 --> 05:19:25.000
And I'll say I have members of my distant family who are now in their 60s, and they still do a lot of activities with their big brothers from when they were kids and they didn't have a dad.

2723
05:19:25.000 --> 05:19:27.500
And it's a beautiful relationship.

2724
05:19:27.500 --> 05:19:37.000
And they're all, you know, older men now who are retiring from really good careers and very civic minded.

2725
05:19:37.000 --> 05:19:46.000
So the idea of mentoring, it's an old school sort of thought, but it actually is very effective.

2726
05:19:46.000 --> 05:19:49.500
And it's really important that we invest.

2727
05:19:49.500 --> 05:19:53.500
We don't have enough mentors for kids now.

2728
05:19:53.500 --> 05:20:22.500
This fund would also, reinvestment fund would also have some flex funds for individualized tailored services, you know, for someone who might need specialized care and to be able to have that and get them through what they need to get through so that they'll completely recover and be able to be back out safely in the community.

2729
05:20:22.500 --> 05:20:38.500
And then along the idea of combining some of the initiatives that are underway right now, in the Senate Bill 94 that would do assessments of kids before they're petitioned for delinquency.

2730
05:20:38.500 --> 05:20:42.000
The assessment needs a place to happen.

2731
05:20:42.000 --> 05:20:56.000
And we've been sort of thinking the idea that it could happen at family resource centers because family resource centers are part of the community and they're normal.

2732
05:20:56.000 --> 05:21:01.000
It's not some institution that you have to go to.

2733
05:21:01.000 --> 05:21:06.500
It's not some police station that you have to go to.

2734
05:21:06.500 --> 05:21:20.000
But if we could somehow support them so that they could manage the plan is that the current juvenile probation and parole officers would conduct the assessments.

2735
05:21:20.000 --> 05:21:37.000
But if they had a nice, safe, comfortable place to do that, and also possibly think about moving diversion services into those family resource centers, we don't have consistent diversion services across the state.

2736
05:21:37.000 --> 05:21:39.000
Some municipalities have them.

2737
05:21:39.000 --> 05:21:58.500
Sometimes they're in police departments, sometimes they're in schools, but taking them out of the law enforcement emphasis and helping kids to feel a little bit more normal and welcoming to treatment might be a good place to go.

2738
05:21:58.500 --> 05:22:06.500
And it supports and upholds the, uplifts the family resource centers, which are really important resources.

2739
05:22:06.500 --> 05:22:52.000
And then finally, it's really important in New York state, in the previous Governor Cuomo, Mario Cuomo, famously walked into a 200 bed juvenile prison, and it was completely empty kids but it was fully staffed and he was very concerned about that in terms of how the state was spending the money but also was very concerned about what to do with the staff who were you know loyal state employees and so he created a fund to retrain redeploy all of the staff that had been at the facility.

2740
05:22:52.000 --> 05:23:00.000
So if you're building a smaller facility, obviously you're not going to need the 90 staff.

2741
05:23:00.000 --> 05:23:08.000
There are a lot of positions open right now on the child welfare side at DCYF.

2742
05:23:08.000 --> 05:23:21.000
There's going to be an enormous amount of positions that are opening up in all of the community-based treatment and support programs that are building up.

2743
05:23:21.000 --> 05:23:28.000
We just heard from a couple of people who are talking about workforce issues.

2744
05:23:28.000 --> 05:23:42.000
I came from Maine most recently, where when all of the paper mills closed down, a lot of people moved into healthcare roles and are liking them too.

2745
05:23:42.000 --> 05:23:56.000
So, you know, making sure that everyone has jobs, I think will be a good way for us to stay honoring the people who work for the state.

2746
05:23:56.000 --> 05:24:14.500
And then something that won't necessarily cost money, but is very important for this transition to happen is to create a multi-agency workgroup that will really focus on the transition and help make some of the decisions.

2747
05:24:14.500 --> 05:24:18.000
And it should include community and families.

2748
05:24:18.000 --> 05:24:26.000
We don't include families and the youth who experience juvenile justice themselves enough in these conversations.

2749
05:24:26.000 --> 05:24:35.000
We would suggest that we start right away by reviewing all the cases of the children at SYSC.

2750
05:24:35.000 --> 05:24:41.000
That's required in the law quarterly out of HB 517 from 2017.

2751
05:24:41.000 --> 05:25:18.500
And while it may be done, we think that bringing in a multi-agency group that may be able to think more creatively and know of other resources and may help push to get kids out of the Sununu Center safely and to achieve consensus on the model of this locked facility and what it's going to include and how we're going to pay for school and health care and to maintain momentum for this change.

2752
05:25:18.500 --> 05:25:38.000
the department has been dogged by the cost of the Sununu Center for many years, but it's very difficult to move forward when you also need to have a place for children and you have so many competing influences.

2753
05:25:38.000 --> 05:25:46.500
And then ultimately for this multi-agency group to monitor the implementation and quality outcomes of this change.

2754
05:25:46.500 --> 05:25:52.500
And the last couple of things to think about is accommodating gender.

2755
05:25:52.500 --> 05:26:05.000
If we're only going to have one small facility, which we do think could accommodate, like how do we accommodate boys, girls and transgender youngsters?

2756
05:26:05.000 --> 05:26:15.500
What do we do about overnight arrests when police pick someone up who's not safe to leave out in the street?

2757
05:26:15.500 --> 05:26:24.500
You know, does this facility have a wing or a cottage where people could be kept safe separately?

2758
05:26:24.500 --> 05:26:27.500
Do we mix detention and commitment?

2759
05:26:27.500 --> 05:26:36.500
They're so small, those two populations, it's hard to think about having more than one facility for each.

2760
05:26:36.500 --> 05:26:38.500
Geographical location is important.

2761
05:26:38.500 --> 05:26:42.500
We looked at where the kids are from.

2762
05:26:42.500 --> 05:26:46.500
Right now they're from all across the state.

2763
05:26:46.500 --> 05:26:52.500
Typically they tend to be from the southern end of the state.

2764
05:26:52.500 --> 05:27:11.500
And then finally, if you were going to have a new facility, thinking about what communities think about it, the not in my backyard influence is always a concern when you're trying to build these kinds of endeavors.

2765
05:27:11.500 --> 05:27:27.000
And finally, we do really need to think, and this necessarily isn't up to you, it's up to all of us to work with the department to seek other funding opportunities.

2766
05:27:27.000 --> 05:27:41.000
There is a Title II formula fund grant that comes from the Office of Juvenile Justice Delinquency Prevention, the federal OJJDP, that goes to the state advisory group.

2767
05:27:41.000 --> 05:27:44.000
We should revisit and reinvest that.

2768
05:27:44.000 --> 05:27:49.500
There's a lot of creative things you can do with that.

2769
05:27:49.500 --> 05:28:10.000
And I understand it's under new leadership and they are taking that under, but that's a resource that we don't want to lose and the OJJDP also has discretionary grants we could think about applying for that would support this transition.

2770
05:28:10.000 --> 05:28:12.000
So let's stop sharing.

2771
05:28:12.000 --> 05:28:21.000
So that's what I had to say quickly and if you have questions I'm happy to take them.

2772
05:28:21.000 --> 05:28:23.000
Thank you, Maura.

2773
05:28:23.000 --> 05:28:31.500
I don't know if there are questions because like I said, I can't really see everyone's hands.

2774
05:28:31.500 --> 05:28:33.500
I have questions.

2775
05:28:33.500 --> 05:28:41.000
I just wanted to make sure everyone had a chance to go before I do.

2776
05:28:41.000 --> 05:28:48.000
So if I were running a business, and this was a business, of business.

2777
05:28:48.000 --> 05:29:12.500
I think based on what you put together in a week from our talking, maybe 15 to 20 minutes, I would promote you and ask you to lead the project to take five or seven people and continue for the next two months to work on an 80-20 solution.

2778
05:29:12.500 --> 05:29:24.000
And that 80-20 solution would be with 20% of the normal time, come up with what you think an 80% solution looks like.

2779
05:29:24.000 --> 05:29:26.000
I like your framework.

2780
05:29:26.000 --> 05:29:37.500
I would like to know in the Vermont and Missouri models, Did they include options for the 14-year-old kid that killed his parents?

2781
05:29:37.500 --> 05:29:42.500
Thank you, Chairman, and thank you for the kind words.

2782
05:29:42.500 --> 05:29:56.500
Because I was trying to rush, I should have prefaced by saying that about two years ago, we were asked to lead a working group on juvenile justice.

2783
05:29:56.500 --> 05:30:08.500
It came out of a committee that was once again looking at what to do with this building that's happened a number of times.

2784
05:30:08.500 --> 05:30:16.500
And so we've been working with probably about 50 people throughout New Hampshire, government advocates everywhere.

2785
05:30:16.500 --> 05:30:24.500
So this isn't something that I necessarily pulled together myself, although I appreciate you thinking that.

2786
05:30:24.500 --> 05:30:31.000
We've also, in that process, made great connections nationally with really excellent consultants.

2787
05:30:31.000 --> 05:30:41.000
So we now have really good relationships around the country to get the information we need and make things happen.

2788
05:30:41.000 --> 05:30:55.500
The thinking around a level of offense is that New York City is now actually putting kids, if not in staff secure group homes, with very high offense levels.

2789
05:30:55.500 --> 05:31:09.000
all of those jurisdictions like New York City do have a higher level I think New York uses a state facility for kids who are extremely dangerous.

2790
05:31:09.000 --> 05:31:24.000
But for the most part, it depends upon that assessment that you do on a child to determine what is it that caused them to do such a bad thing.

2791
05:31:24.000 --> 05:31:27.000
And sometimes that can be mitigated.

2792
05:31:27.000 --> 05:31:30.000
It can be mitigated by medication.

2793
05:31:30.000 --> 05:31:35.500
It can be mitigated by removing them from an adverse situation.

2794
05:31:35.500 --> 05:31:39.000
It can be mitigated by many things.

2795
05:31:39.000 --> 05:31:46.500
So these models, when you go into the secure group home, the kids are mixed.

2796
05:31:46.500 --> 05:31:48.500
They're all the same.

2797
05:31:48.500 --> 05:32:15.500
And I would say from experience, the kids who have presented the most danger in the three years that I've been observing the Sununu Youth Services Center are the kids who have come in really mentally ill, like really sick, who really belonged either in a hospital or in a psychiatric residential treatment facility.

2798
05:32:15.500 --> 05:32:30.000
The kids who have committed terrible crimes since I've been here, if they're not mentally ill, they tend to be really some of the best kids to work with.

2799
05:32:30.000 --> 05:32:39.500
There's oftentimes, and you'll read in the research, there's oftentimes reason behind why they do the things they do.

2800
05:32:39.500 --> 05:32:44.500
And once that's resolved, they're much less dangerous to society.

2801
05:32:44.500 --> 05:32:58.000
And so those are the kids that we've seen finish school while they were at the Sununu Center, help out, not get in a lot of trouble.

2802
05:32:58.000 --> 05:33:12.000
So you can't determine how difficult it will be to care for a child based on their offense, because there's a lot of factors that feed into that.

2803
05:33:12.000 --> 05:33:41.000
But the way the Missouri model is built is that the staff is highly trained, and there's very deep supervision of the staff, and there's a low staff-to-child ratio so that they are able to manage the whole mix of the kids, unless it's someone who's really mentally ill and that's someone who would need acute psychiatric care.

2804
05:33:41.000 --> 05:34:05.500
Just to continue the conversation, the flip side of the coin on caring for the child that killed his or her parents is that there's a public safety concern, that there's just a public concern that their neighborhoods, their families are being protected by whatever the state action is.

2805
05:34:05.500 --> 05:34:16.500
So, as important as it is to look at the child's just assume you'd be, you'd appreciate that there's a balance there.

2806
05:34:16.500 --> 05:34:18.500
Yes.

2807
05:34:18.500 --> 05:34:22.500
Thank you for that opportunity to clarify that.

2808
05:34:22.500 --> 05:34:24.500
Absolutely.

2809
05:34:24.500 --> 05:34:33.000
A child who has committed a very serious offense like that would be in the secure facility.

2810
05:34:33.000 --> 05:34:36.500
You know, there's no doubt about that.

2811
05:34:36.500 --> 05:34:46.500
And then once you're there, they're doing the assessment and working with the child and sending them where they go.

2812
05:34:46.500 --> 05:35:16.500
So if you had a couple of months and you could bring in another five people, five to seven people, and do sort of a short version of a multi-agency study, do you think you could come up with something, a set of options that are really on the cusp of being actionable in terms of what the legislature does?

2813
05:35:16.500 --> 05:35:18.500
Sure, thank you, Chairman.

2814
05:35:18.500 --> 05:35:31.000
I think we absolutely could, but I do have to say that I run an agency with a very broad mandate with very little resources.

2815
05:35:31.000 --> 05:35:39.000
So it would be tough for us to focus just on that and get it done.

2816
05:35:39.000 --> 05:35:50.000
So we have a, we have a number of large, you know, projects and investigations that we have to give attention to.

2817
05:35:50.000 --> 05:36:04.000
I mean, if it were possible to have a few dollars to hire a consultant to coordinate that sort of a project, I think it would be doable.

2818
05:36:04.000 --> 05:36:15.000
But it's hard for me to, you know, overextend my agency and not be able to meet our mandate in other ways.

2819
05:36:15.000 --> 05:36:17.000
I appreciate that.

2820
05:36:17.000 --> 05:36:26.500
So how quickly could you hire a consultant and how much money would you need for a two-month project?

2821
05:36:26.500 --> 05:36:31.000
Off the top's, that's the top of your head.

2822
05:36:31.000 --> 05:36:33.000
Yeah.

2823
05:36:33.000 --> 05:36:35.000
I'm terrible with numbers.

2824
05:36:35.000 --> 05:36:39.000
It's why I'm not on the finance committee.

2825
05:36:39.000 --> 05:36:46.500
You know, I would, I would, I, you know, I, I couldn't even guess it.

2826
05:36:46.500 --> 05:36:50.000
I can get that information for you.

2827
05:36:50.000 --> 05:36:52.000
Yeah.

2828
05:36:52.000 --> 05:36:54.000
Think about that.

2829
05:36:54.000 --> 05:37:04.000
I really, I think we have, as I understand the budget process, we, we finish our work on the 24th.

2830
05:37:04.000 --> 05:37:06.000
It goes to Senate.

2831
05:37:06.000 --> 05:37:10.500
Senate works on it for a month or two.

2832
05:37:10.500 --> 05:37:15.000
And then it goes to a committee of conference.

2833
05:37:15.000 --> 05:37:32.500
So if there was an expeditious way to really try to come up with something, I think maybe at the back end of this and the committee you know, maybe we could do something actionable.

2834
05:37:32.500 --> 05:37:34.500
Sure, sure.

2835
05:37:34.500 --> 05:37:39.500
I'd be happy to, you know, send some feelers out.

2836
05:37:39.500 --> 05:38:02.000
I actually have a meeting tomorrow with folks who have been great resource to us from Columbia University and so and I'm sure they're well connected enough to give me a sense of who's available for that kind of work and what it would cost.

2837
05:38:02.000 --> 05:38:12.500
And I just also want to let you know I appreciated your concerns about the existing personnel at the Sununu Center.

2838
05:38:12.500 --> 05:38:22.500
And I would just say that in all of these presentations, we continuously hear the theme that there are vacancies.

2839
05:38:22.500 --> 05:38:33.000
And so I would really hope that there would be a redeployment retraining opportunity there that would be part of it.

2840
05:38:33.000 --> 05:38:42.500
And since you put it in your slide deck, I think that would come out of an 80-20 plan.

2841
05:38:42.500 --> 05:38:44.500
Yeah, thank you.

2842
05:38:44.500 --> 05:38:47.000
I think that's really important.

2843
05:38:47.000 --> 05:38:51.500
I think it's important to be respectful of them.

2844
05:38:51.500 --> 05:39:06.000
And it has been hard for them because not only do people talk about closing the facility, but it's often in the news as though it's a terrible place.

2845
05:39:06.000 --> 05:39:12.500
And we know that there's a lawsuit right now and a criminal investigation.

2846
05:39:12.500 --> 05:39:25.500
And I do want to emphasize that our discussion today about looking for an alternative transition for this facility has nothing to do with those things.

2847
05:39:25.500 --> 05:39:39.000
It has everything to do with what the science tells us works, what makes a community safer, and what would start to save New Hampshire some money.

2848
05:39:39.000 --> 05:39:42.500
So far, I've been asking you questions.

2849
05:39:42.500 --> 05:39:51.000
I haven't asked you to do any work other than to be able to answer the question.

2850
05:39:51.000 --> 05:39:54.000
Other than to solve the problem.

2851
05:39:54.000 --> 05:39:56.000
Yeah, solve the problem.

2852
05:39:56.000 --> 05:39:58.000
That's all I'm asking.

2853
05:39:58.000 --> 05:40:03.500
So, so I, again, I just really want to thank you.

2854
05:40:03.500 --> 05:40:07.500
I mean, you and I had never met.

2855
05:40:07.500 --> 05:40:12.500
We talked for 15 to 20 minutes on the phone.

2856
05:40:12.500 --> 05:40:16.000
Thank you, Representative Wollner for introducing us.

2857
05:40:16.000 --> 05:40:20.500
And I really, I appreciate what you put together.

2858
05:40:20.500 --> 05:40:25.000
I think it was, it was very, very tight.

2859
05:40:25.000 --> 05:40:27.000
Very good.

2860
05:40:27.000 --> 05:40:29.000
Great.

2861
05:40:29.000 --> 05:40:31.000
Thank you.

2862
05:40:31.000 --> 05:40:33.000
We're happy to help.

2863
05:40:33.000 --> 05:40:36.500
Any other questions I'm happy to answer?

2864
05:40:36.500 --> 05:40:40.000
Otherwise, I'll thank you for your time.

2865
05:40:40.000 --> 05:40:45.500
I'd just like to say thank you for joining us, Mara.

2866
05:40:45.500 --> 05:40:48.000
It was a great presentation.

2867
05:40:48.000 --> 05:40:50.000
Thank you.

2868
05:40:50.000 --> 05:40:54.000
This is lots of things to think about.

2869
05:40:54.000 --> 05:41:04.500
And please, I'll get back to the committee when I have more information about the consultant and a plan around that.

2870
05:41:04.500 --> 05:41:12.500
But if any of you have questions in the meantime, please don't hesitate to reach out.

2871
05:41:12.500 --> 05:41:14.500
Mr.

2872
05:41:14.500 --> 05:41:23.000
Chair, I think that's the end of the three people that Kathy and Sharon and I invited.

2873
05:41:23.000 --> 05:41:25.000
All right.

2874
05:41:25.000 --> 05:41:27.000
Well, thank you.

2875
05:41:27.000 --> 05:41:29.000
Well done.

2876
05:41:29.000 --> 05:41:33.000
It's almost like you've been a chairman before.

2877
05:41:33.000 --> 05:41:35.000
I tried once before.

2878
05:41:35.000 --> 05:41:39.000
So is Representative Cody Belanger in the audience?

2879
05:41:39.000 --> 05:41:46.500
Because I think he had thought he was going to speak in conjunction with Maura.

2880
05:41:46.500 --> 05:41:48.500
Don't touch anything.

2881
05:41:48.500 --> 05:41:51.000
Do you see Cody Belanger?

2882
05:41:51.000 --> 05:41:53.500
I don't see that name.

2883
05:41:53.500 --> 05:41:55.500
All right.

2884
05:41:55.500 --> 05:42:04.000
So why don't you bring in Jim Moynihan and Chuck Nickerson both and we'll start a conversation.

2885
05:42:04.000 --> 05:42:06.000
Okay, I see Jim.

2886
05:42:06.000 --> 05:42:09.500
And it looks like Chuck is there.

2887
05:42:09.500 --> 05:42:15.000
So you guys can both take your mics off of mute.

2888
05:42:15.000 --> 05:42:17.000
Okay, Mr.

2889
05:42:17.000 --> 05:42:20.500
Nickerson, it's good seeing you again, sir.

2890
05:42:20.500 --> 05:42:24.000
Good seeing you to be representative Edwards.

2891
05:42:24.000 --> 05:42:27.000
Okay, now both you and Mr.

2892
05:42:27.000 --> 05:42:31.500
Moynihan are going to talk about the related topic.

2893
05:42:31.500 --> 05:42:39.500
I don't know if you've done any coordination of your presentation between the two of you.

2894
05:42:39.500 --> 05:42:54.000
We have actually, and I'd like to, if you could bring in Ray Bauer, who's the long-term care administrator and also the county administrator for Stratford County as well.

2895
05:42:54.000 --> 05:42:58.000
He'll help present the county's point of view.

2896
05:42:58.000 --> 05:43:03.000
Okay, I see someone in the audience just named Ray.

2897
05:43:03.000 --> 05:43:07.000
I'm going to assume that's who it is.

2898
05:43:07.000 --> 05:43:09.000
Yes.

2899
05:43:09.000 --> 05:43:11.500
Good to see you, Chuck.

2900
05:43:11.500 --> 05:43:15.500
Hey, good to see you too, Representative Weiler.

2901
05:43:15.500 --> 05:43:21.000
So do you just want me to lead off Representative Edwards?

2902
05:43:21.000 --> 05:43:23.000
Please.

2903
05:43:23.000 --> 05:43:25.000
Okay.

2904
05:43:25.000 --> 05:43:38.000
So as you may or may not know, I think you probably do from probably talking to other members of your committee and also Representative Weiler.

2905
05:43:38.000 --> 05:43:47.000
A main concern of the counties is the governor's proposed budget as it pertains to the county cap.

2906
05:43:47.000 --> 05:44:02.000
So normally there would be about a three percent annual increase in the county cap and in what's called for in the governor's budget is actually an 18 percent increase.

2907
05:44:02.000 --> 05:44:10.500
Now just to kind of correlate correlate, you know, what does a 3% versus 18% increase mean?

2908
05:44:10.500 --> 05:44:22.500
With a 3% based upon the SFY 2021 cap, that's about $3.7 million increase to all 10 counties in total for the net cap.

2909
05:44:22.500 --> 05:44:32.000
If an 18% increase means an increase of about $22 million, not 3.7, but $22 million to the counties.

2910
05:44:32.000 --> 05:45:30.000
And because that increase is happening all in the first year, you also have a cumulative second year increase as well overall for the two-year period basically it comes to an amount about 33 million dollars over two years that normally the counties would be worrying about now say like seven and a half to eight million maybe at most for an increase the counties are worried about now about 24 25 million dollars higher than anticipated or actually sorry 33 million dollars higher over two years anticipated than a normal two-year budget and in turn that's going to lead to a tax increase for Rockham County I can say it's going to be 7.2 percent.

2911
05:45:30.000 --> 05:45:38.000
I believe Ray from Stratford confirmed too for Stratford County it's about a 7% tax increase.

2912
05:45:38.000 --> 05:45:43.500
And there's not really, you know, revenues coming in per se.

2913
05:45:43.500 --> 05:45:54.500
I mean, yes, we have some as a result from MQIP as a result of and spent monies, you know, in 504.

2914
05:45:54.500 --> 05:45:56.500
But...

2915
05:45:56.500 --> 05:46:04.500
So put in perspective for us that 7 percent, that's 7 percent at the county level.

2916
05:46:04.500 --> 05:46:06.500
What would that be?

2917
05:46:06.500 --> 05:46:12.500
So would it feel like to a typical Rockingham County property taxpayer?

2918
05:46:12.500 --> 05:46:16.000
Well, it depends what town you're from.

2919
05:46:16.000 --> 05:46:28.000
If you're from Portsmouth, you could be looking at county taxes make up, you know, five percent, five, six percent of your tax bill.

2920
05:46:28.000 --> 05:46:46.500
It seems like mostly the donor town tax, you know, taxpayers would feel more of that impact versus, you know, some other town that's not a donor town, whether, you know, say Derry, Lunderry, something like that.

2921
05:46:46.500 --> 05:46:58.000
So your people that are from, say, Newington, Newcastle, Portsmouth, Rye, they're the ones who are going to feel more so this increase.

2922
05:46:58.000 --> 05:47:13.500
So I can't like give you, you know, it's going to seem one way to, you know, when, you know, all county taxpayers for Rockingham or from other counties as well.

2923
05:47:13.500 --> 05:48:01.500
But at the end of it, it would be a perceptible increase in their property taxes i mean i would think so especially if you're a commercial taxpayer as far as commercial property owner um obviously the towns especially see it uh because they're the ones who actually directly pay the counties so they would especially see it i could easily picture a city of Portsmouth calling, you know, like right away once they were seeing, you know, once they were hearing the amount of what would be approved for taxes by the Rockham County delegation.

2924
05:48:01.500 --> 05:48:04.500
If this was not to change.

2925
05:48:04.500 --> 05:48:11.000
Now, obviously, from the governor's last proposed budget, it was a 9% increase.

2926
05:48:11.000 --> 05:48:21.000
So we're used to seeing a much larger increase, and then it settles down at about a 3% past increase.

2927
05:48:21.000 --> 05:48:25.500
So we know this is only the starting point.

2928
05:48:25.500 --> 05:48:35.000
So, but this is the largest increase I've seen in my, you know, 12 years here at the county.

2929
05:48:35.000 --> 05:48:41.000
I'm sure Ray will probably confirm it's the highest one he's seen.

2930
05:48:41.000 --> 05:48:46.000
That's been in the governor's proposed budget for his time.

2931
05:48:46.000 --> 05:48:50.000
But, but again, you know, 7% tax increase.

2932
05:48:50.000 --> 05:48:58.000
Again, normally, you know, Rockham County alone would be seeing a 3.7 million increase in taxes.

2933
05:48:58.000 --> 05:49:31.500
And that's the norm for all 10 counties seeing in one fiscal year for a cap increase so it's it's definitely something that we're concerned about but again we realize it's only the starting point and uh and we do have some other topics that that kind of feed off of that And I guess for some of the other items, I'll hand it off to Ray.

2934
05:49:31.500 --> 05:49:35.000
So Ray, if you can unmute yourself.

2935
05:49:35.000 --> 05:49:37.000
Thank you.

2936
05:49:37.000 --> 05:49:39.500
My name is Ray Bauer.

2937
05:49:39.500 --> 05:49:59.000
For whatever reason, my video isn't picking up, but my name is Ray Bauer.'ve been the county administrator and a nursing home administrator in Stratford County for 32 years and just to finish off one point that Chuck made.

2938
05:49:59.000 --> 05:50:12.000
This is the highest starting point we've ever seen in the governor's proposed budget in terms of the county cap since there's been a county cap.

2939
05:50:12.000 --> 05:50:15.000
However many years that goes back.

2940
05:50:15.000 --> 05:50:25.500
A couple of the other things that concern us in relation to the way the budget's proposed is the bed count.

2941
05:50:25.500 --> 05:50:29.500
This is based on 4,100 projected Medicaid residents.

2942
05:50:29.500 --> 05:50:31.500
And...

2943
05:50:31.500 --> 05:50:35.500
This is based on 4,100 projected Medicaid residents.

2944
05:50:35.500 --> 05:50:50.000
And I can assure you, although the state isn't sharing with us the exact average bed count, the last update was in the public dashboard is November of 2019.

2945
05:50:50.000 --> 05:50:54.500
I can assure you it's nowhere near 4,100 beds.

2946
05:50:54.500 --> 05:51:04.000
Just between the vacant beds due to COVID, between Rockingham, Stratford, Hillsborough, and Merrimack, it's not even 3,700 beds.

2947
05:51:04.000 --> 05:51:17.000
So one of the things that we were working or hoping for an adjustment on is that the bed count at 4,100 is much too high.

2948
05:51:17.000 --> 05:51:29.500
And obviously, the cost is a product of the bed count times the average Medicaid reimbursement rate equals the total amount of money that's appropriated.

2949
05:51:29.500 --> 05:51:41.000
So, but to give you a clearer example of that, in January, there was every January and every July, there's a rate adjustment.

2950
05:51:41.000 --> 05:51:49.500
The rate adjustment for or in January, the state used a bed count of 3,791 Medicaid residents.

2951
05:51:49.500 --> 05:52:01.000
And as you know, COVID has continued to be problematic, certainly between January and now, and certainly into the rest of the year.

2952
05:52:01.000 --> 05:52:12.500
So the fact that the state used 3791 in January, but is proposing 4,100 for July, just on its face doesn't seem correct.

2953
05:52:12.500 --> 05:52:16.000
May I ask you a question there?

2954
05:52:16.000 --> 05:52:18.000
Certainly.

2955
05:52:18.000 --> 05:52:25.500
Yeah, so I've not played with this cost management formula that you're so familiar with?

2956
05:52:25.500 --> 05:52:41.500
Am I right to assume that if the bed count assumption declines quite a bit, that that in effect reduces the amount of money that the counties would be projected to expend?

2957
05:52:41.500 --> 05:52:43.500
Absolutely, sir.

2958
05:52:43.500 --> 05:52:46.000
You're absolutely correct, Representative Edwards.

2959
05:52:46.000 --> 05:52:48.000
Okay.

2960
05:52:48.000 --> 05:52:53.500
So what's bad about planning 4,100, having it really be 3,700?

2961
05:52:53.500 --> 05:52:59.000
Your budget would be planned to be higher than the reality.

2962
05:52:59.000 --> 05:53:07.500
So that wouldn't be a great plan, but what's the worst part of doing it that way?

2963
05:53:07.500 --> 05:53:40.000
Well, that's a main contributor to the proposed increase for the county taxpayers is that we're being our county taxpayers are being assessed for based on a number that doesn't exist and that money would then be you know have to be appropriated for beds that we know won't be filled and that's again a large contributor to the numbers that Chuck Nickerson brought up.

2964
05:53:40.000 --> 05:53:42.000
So Mr.

2965
05:53:42.000 --> 05:53:49.000
Nickerson mentioned under the current budget, there's an 18% increase in the governor's budget.

2966
05:53:49.000 --> 05:54:02.500
if if the planning number were reduced to 3,700, did you happen to figure out what kind of percentage increase we'd be talking about in that scenario?

2967
05:54:02.500 --> 05:54:06.000
I can only presume that's 10% reduction.

2968
05:54:06.000 --> 05:54:12.500
I can presume it's 10% off the top for what the governor's proposed.

2969
05:54:12.500 --> 05:54:18.500
Okay, so we'd still be talking about 15%, 16% instead of 18%.

2970
05:54:18.500 --> 05:54:29.000
Well, you'd still be talking probably 8% or 10% as opposed to the 18% if we reduced it you know 10.

2971
05:54:29.000 --> 05:54:31.000
Yes.

2972
05:54:31.000 --> 05:54:49.000
All right so so the takeaway from there for me is it's just really important to get the state and the county to come up with a good agreed upon bed count estimate for the future.

2973
05:54:49.000 --> 05:54:51.000
That would be wonderful.

2974
05:54:51.000 --> 05:55:17.000
Any any pressure that this committee could exert on the state to give us an average bed count for the last year or month by month, which used to be published on their dashboard, that would be really helpful in us entertaining a meaningful negotiation with the state about that line item.

2975
05:55:17.000 --> 05:55:20.000
the state about that line item.

2976
05:55:20.000 --> 05:55:24.500
So we're not here to pressure the executive branch.

2977
05:55:24.500 --> 05:55:28.000
We're here to work with them collaboratively.

2978
05:55:28.000 --> 05:55:30.000
Sorry, Representative Edwards.

2979
05:55:30.000 --> 05:55:33.500
Bad choice of words on my part.

2980
05:55:33.500 --> 05:55:35.500
All right.

2981
05:55:35.500 --> 05:55:37.500
Keep going.

2982
05:55:37.500 --> 05:55:57.000
The other thing that might end up with legislation, and we hope it doesn't, is that the counties right now, by statute, share the obligation with the federal government of paying for long-term care Medicaid at 50 and 50.

2983
05:55:57.000 --> 05:56:00.500
So we pay half, they pay half.

2984
05:56:00.500 --> 05:56:08.000
One, one issue is that the federal government increased their contribution from 50% to 56.2%.

2985
05:56:08.000 --> 05:56:17.500
And, but the counties have received no benefit by having their share reduced when the federal share went up.

2986
05:56:17.500 --> 05:56:27.000
And we've been trying to work with the state to agree on the mathematical formula to make that equitable.

2987
05:56:27.000 --> 05:56:59.500
So if the counties pay for the half that the federal government doesn't pay for, and the federal government wants to pay more than half, we believe, as we have in the past, that the federal government doesn't pay for and the federal government wants to pay more than half, we believe as we have in the past that the counties should receive that reduction.

2988
05:56:59.500 --> 05:57:06.000
That's about 15 million dollars a year spread out over the 10 counties.

2989
05:57:06.000 --> 05:57:16.500
To date, even though we've made efforts to work with DHHS to come up with an equitable solution, that hasn't occurred.

2990
05:57:16.500 --> 05:57:28.000
And we just wanted to bring that to the attention of the committee because it might end up needing to be resolved legislatively.

2991
05:57:28.000 --> 05:57:30.500
And we hope it doesn't.

2992
05:57:30.500 --> 05:57:44.000
Okay, so in the coming budget, how far into the budget do you think will go before the federal government may reduce that 56% back to 50%?

2993
05:57:44.000 --> 05:57:48.000
It's 90 days after the pandemic is stopped.

2994
05:57:48.000 --> 05:57:51.000
That's what the current law says.

2995
05:57:51.000 --> 05:58:01.500
So it continues until the federal government says there's no pandemic any longer, and then it goes 90 days beyond that.

2996
05:58:01.500 --> 05:58:08.500
But the other thing is it goes backwards also to when the pandemic began.

2997
05:58:08.500 --> 05:58:17.500
So we're actually talking about a portion into the last fiscal year and all of this fiscal year.

2998
05:58:17.500 --> 05:58:26.000
So right now, we're probably talking $20 million that's in question between the state and the counties.

2999
05:58:26.000 --> 05:58:30.000
And every month it continues to go up.

3000
05:58:30.000 --> 05:58:39.500
I don't have a good vision as to when the federal government believes that the pandemic will be over.

3001
05:58:39.500 --> 05:58:48.500
But I have every confidence that it's, you know, going to last for the balance of this year.

3002
05:58:48.500 --> 05:58:57.500
So every, again, every month that goes by, you know, it's another one and a quarter million dollars.

3003
05:58:57.500 --> 05:59:00.500
Representative Irf, you have a question?

3004
05:59:00.500 --> 05:59:02.500
I do.

3005
05:59:02.500 --> 05:59:04.500
Thank you, Mr.

3006
05:59:04.500 --> 05:59:06.500
Chairman.

3007
05:59:06.500 --> 05:59:09.500
So, Ray, I have a question.

3008
05:59:09.500 --> 05:59:18.500
First of all, I'll give you some background about what I've heard, what I understand from the state.

3009
05:59:18.500 --> 05:59:41.000
One of the statements I believe they make is that that enhanced FNAP is intended to account for the fact that they can no longer, the discharge is the wrong word, but they have to keep people on Medicaid, I guess, that no longer qualify.

3010
05:59:41.000 --> 05:59:53.000
And a question I've asked them, which I've not been able to get an answer to, is do you know who those people are?

3011
05:59:53.000 --> 05:59:58.000
I don't mean the names, but I mean the population.

3012
05:59:58.000 --> 06:00:01.000
Are those people in nursing homes?

3013
06:00:01.000 --> 06:00:11.500
Are those people in, you know, what situations are those people in that supposedly are the reason for the enhanced F-MAP?

3014
06:00:11.500 --> 06:00:14.000
They're not in nursing homes.

3015
06:00:14.000 --> 06:00:19.000
They're not part of the people that we're responsible for.

3016
06:00:19.000 --> 06:00:21.000
At all?

3017
06:00:21.000 --> 06:00:23.000
At all.

3018
06:00:23.000 --> 06:00:44.500
When we've asked the state, why are you keeping that $6.2 million, it was said to us at the beginning that, or I'm sorry, 6.2%, that it's used to offset other Medicaid costs, but it falls outside of any of the county's responsibilities.

3019
06:00:44.500 --> 06:00:48.000
Now, our discussions have continued since then.

3020
06:00:48.000 --> 06:00:53.500
I'm not sure that that still continues to be their point.

3021
06:00:53.500 --> 06:00:58.000
But we, again, we're trying to resolve this non-legislatively.

3022
06:00:58.000 --> 06:01:03.500
And we're trying to resolve this through direct contact with DHHS.

3023
06:01:03.500 --> 06:01:24.000
And when you say it doesn't include any of the people the county is responsible for, are you including the other lines in this calculation, the mid-level care expenses, the home support waiver services, and the home health care waiver services?

3024
06:01:24.000 --> 06:01:28.000
As far as I know, yes, sir, absolutely.

3025
06:01:28.000 --> 06:01:40.500
The state has never brought it to our attention at all that this, in fact, kind of it's the first time that I've heard this.

3026
06:01:40.500 --> 06:01:51.000
But they've never brought it to our attention that any of those people are included in that dilemma that they have.

3027
06:01:51.000 --> 06:01:55.000
Okay, can you guess who those people are?

3028
06:01:55.000 --> 06:01:57.000
I don't know, sir.

3029
06:01:57.000 --> 06:02:10.000
As you know, the Medicaid system is very expansive, especially with all the changes that have been made in Medicaid system in the last few years.

3030
06:02:10.000 --> 06:02:19.500
So I know as an example, because our county of a population of 120,000 has 20,000 people on Medicaid.

3031
06:02:19.500 --> 06:02:32.500
So I, and only a fraction of those people are in our part of what the county is responsible for, a small fraction of those people.

3032
06:02:32.500 --> 06:02:43.000
So my, you know, I can only presume it's somewhere of the 21,500 extra people that aren't currently the county's responsibility.

3033
06:02:43.000 --> 06:02:46.000
I thank you for your answers.

3034
06:02:46.000 --> 06:02:51.500
Are there any other questions while we're kind of taking questions?

3035
06:02:51.500 --> 06:02:53.500
I'm not seeing any.

3036
06:02:53.500 --> 06:02:57.000
Do you remember where you left off?

3037
06:02:57.000 --> 06:03:08.500
Yes, I just have one last point and I know it's been a long day for you so I'll make it very quickly.

3038
06:03:08.500 --> 06:03:27.500
For all of the time that all of you have spent on your county delegation, I know that you're well familiar with a system of drawdown from the federal government called ProShare that all the counties benefit from.

3039
06:03:27.500 --> 06:03:36.000
It matches what the nursing homes are reimbursed compared to what the federal Medicare upper limit is.

3040
06:03:36.000 --> 06:03:42.500
And that's been guaranteed to us as a relatively constant source of revenue.

3041
06:03:42.500 --> 06:03:48.000
However, we've been notified that that's likely to get down precipitously.

3042
06:03:48.000 --> 06:03:55.000
The state is calculating that information to us, and that will affect every county.

3043
06:03:55.000 --> 06:04:14.000
So we just wanted to take this opportunity to let you know that it makes that large proposed increase by the governor even more difficult to swallow when we're potentially losing a good portion of our revenue stream.

3044
06:04:14.000 --> 06:04:16.000
Okay.

3045
06:04:16.000 --> 06:04:20.500
So can you quantify that pro-share impact at all?

3046
06:04:20.500 --> 06:04:23.500
I don't recall hearing a number.

3047
06:04:23.500 --> 06:04:28.500
Our Shrafford County gets about $6.1 million in pro share.

3048
06:04:28.500 --> 06:04:38.500
We're supposed to have calculations by the end of this week about what the new pro share distribution amount is.

3049
06:04:38.500 --> 06:04:48.000
It's scheduled in the state budget to be a gross number of $71 million distributed to all 10 counties.

3050
06:04:48.000 --> 06:05:07.000
I couldn't even get a guesstimate from your director of Medicaid, from Henry, and he's been trying very hard to get us that number, but he won't have that number, he says, till the end of this week.

3051
06:05:07.000 --> 06:05:15.500
But from every indication we've had, that it could go down as much as 50% or more.

3052
06:05:15.500 --> 06:05:21.000
Okay, so I have a different kind of question for you.

3053
06:05:21.000 --> 06:05:24.000
It's kind of organizational slash communication.

3054
06:05:24.000 --> 06:05:30.500
How is it that the 10 counties communicate to DHHS on these issues?

3055
06:05:30.500 --> 06:05:43.000
Is there an organization on behalf of the counties that serves point to talk to somebody at DHHS or is it every county for themselves?

3056
06:05:43.000 --> 06:05:48.500
No, it's absolutely coordinated through Jim Monahan and the DuPont group.

3057
06:05:48.500 --> 06:05:57.000
We'll communicate with Lori Shibonett, your commissioner, and we and Jim will pick experts from respective counties.

3058
06:05:57.000 --> 06:06:06.500
All counties are involved and all counties have been consulted with the positions that we've been putting forward today.

3059
06:06:06.500 --> 06:06:14.500
And we try and consolidate the input to your respective legislative committees to keep it short.

3060
06:06:14.500 --> 06:06:23.500
And the last thing you want is 10 people, one from each county saying the exact same thing.

3061
06:06:23.500 --> 06:06:27.500
Okay, are there any other questions for Mr.

3062
06:06:27.500 --> 06:06:29.500
Bowers or Mr.

3063
06:06:29.500 --> 06:06:31.500
Nickerson?

3064
06:06:31.500 --> 06:06:33.500
I'm not seeing any.

3065
06:06:33.500 --> 06:06:41.000
Do either of you have kind of final thought now that we've talked through that?

3066
06:06:41.000 --> 06:06:44.000
Cause I'm about to bring Mr.

3067
06:06:44.000 --> 06:06:46.000
Moynihan in.

3068
06:06:46.000 --> 06:06:55.500
I just wanted to thank you for your time and and and your willingness to listen to our plight.

3069
06:06:55.500 --> 06:07:06.000
Well it's not just you obviously right I mean we're in effect listening to our every property taxpayer in New Hampshire.

3070
06:07:06.000 --> 06:07:08.000
Yes sir.

3071
06:07:08.000 --> 06:07:26.000
You're presenting a picture where, you know, if we don't talk to one another, we're going to accidentally cause a huge property tax or at least a significant property tax increase for everyone in the state.

3072
06:07:26.000 --> 06:07:35.000
So I'm pretty sure that nobody wants to be raising taxes right now coming out of a pandemic.

3073
06:07:35.000 --> 06:07:40.500
So Representative Edwards, it was a question that you asked Mr.

3074
06:07:40.500 --> 06:07:46.000
Nickerson, but maybe it's because I've been around way too long.

3075
06:07:46.000 --> 06:07:56.500
I would estimate for an average Stratford County taxpayer, that increase would be three to $400 on their tax bill annually.

3076
06:07:56.500 --> 06:07:58.500
So that's real money.

3077
06:07:58.500 --> 06:08:05.000
I mean, if I had to write another $400 check, I'd notice it.

3078
06:08:05.000 --> 06:08:08.500
That would be for the average taxpayer.

3079
06:08:08.500 --> 06:08:18.000
You know, when you multiply that for business taxes and things, I think you'd see a more substantial increase.

3080
06:08:18.000 --> 06:08:25.500
For Stratford County, about 10% of the average tax bill is related to county expenses.

3081
06:08:25.500 --> 06:08:30.000
That's simply a product of the equalized assessed evaluation.

3082
06:08:30.000 --> 06:08:37.500
And if you take an average home, they pay about $400, between $400 and $500.

3083
06:08:37.500 --> 06:09:31.000
When you multiply that by the 8%, you're you're talking about four hundred dollars okay thank you thank you so much uh mr monahan do you do you want to go off of uh mute and there you are good afternoon you have prepared uh like a thought in mind that you came prepared to share with us or you know not necessarily I think we want to make sure the county officials spoke directly to the committee so I think Chuck and Ray did a really good job of that I should just add a couple of observations you asked about organized communications with the department.

3084
06:09:31.000 --> 06:09:42.000
We do have a county state finance commission that meets at least quarterly, if not more frequently, for that level of engagement.

3085
06:09:42.000 --> 06:09:47.000
And Representative Weiler is a legislative representative to that committee.

3086
06:09:47.000 --> 06:09:54.000
So that's kind of on top of the association effort that Ray talked about.

3087
06:09:54.000 --> 06:10:22.000
I think that our goal know, our goal on this page of the budget, I guess, is to try to work cooperatively with the department to bring you all a solution so that we don't have the steep increase in county property tax rates, but at the same time, try to fund the long-term care structure.

3088
06:10:22.000 --> 06:10:40.500
So I think, you know, as it's been identified here, I think the pieces to that are getting a good bed count, funding to that, and then finding the right balance between the county and state contribution.

3089
06:10:40.500 --> 06:11:00.000
I suspect over the next few days, we could probably have a more precise straw proposal for you to look at for both House Bill 1 and House Bill 2, if that's something you'd like us to work on.

3090
06:11:00.000 --> 06:11:02.000
Absolutely.

3091
06:11:02.000 --> 06:11:18.500
I mean, I don't know if you know our internal timeline, but Division 3, we have to be finished with what our work is on the DHHS budget on the 24th of March.

3092
06:11:18.500 --> 06:11:46.500
So if we get something earlier than that and give us some time to internalize it and soak it a little bit that would be helpful then that our contribution goes to the finance committee where chairman weiler will integrate everything i've never seen that but i i just know my panic date is the 24th.

3093
06:11:46.500 --> 06:11:48.500
Okay.

3094
06:11:48.500 --> 06:11:53.000
Yeah, no, we can work with you on that.

3095
06:11:53.000 --> 06:12:17.000
I mean, I think is was identified, you know, there are some tricky components here and, you know, folks like Karen rounds and Henry Lippman have worked very well with us and we, you know, particularly around the pro share piece so we don't lose any federal dollars.

3096
06:12:17.000 --> 06:12:22.000
I mean, that's a big goal, I think, all around.

3097
06:12:22.000 --> 06:12:25.500
So there is some complexity to it.

3098
06:12:25.500 --> 06:12:29.000
Okay, are there any questions for Mr.

3099
06:12:29.000 --> 06:12:31.000
Moynihan?

3100
06:12:31.000 --> 06:12:35.000
Let's go out and look at the attendees.

3101
06:12:35.000 --> 06:12:43.000
Do the attendees have a question or a short refinement, of something that has been said.

3102
06:12:43.000 --> 06:12:48.000
This isn't, we're not trying to create a debate society.

3103
06:12:48.000 --> 06:12:51.500
We're just trying to get things exposed.

3104
06:12:51.500 --> 06:12:55.000
I'm not seeing anyone, are you, Mr.

3105
06:12:55.000 --> 06:12:57.000
Ripple, on the attendees?

3106
06:12:57.000 --> 06:12:59.000
I'm not.

3107
06:12:59.000 --> 06:13:01.000
Okay.

3108
06:13:01.000 --> 06:13:03.000
Well, all right.

3109
06:13:03.000 --> 06:13:06.000
So I think that does it.

3110
06:13:06.000 --> 06:13:11.500
Have I forgotten somebody that I wanted to have to speak?

3111
06:13:11.500 --> 06:13:14.000
I don't think I have.

3112
06:13:14.000 --> 06:13:20.000
I think you covered everybody on the email that you sent out.

3113
06:13:20.000 --> 06:13:22.000
OK, good.

3114
06:13:22.000 --> 06:13:29.500
All right, well, I think that closes down the guest star portion of today's presentations.

3115
06:13:29.500 --> 06:13:32.500
And wait, we have Representative Nordgren.

3116
06:13:32.500 --> 06:13:34.500
Question?

3117
06:13:34.500 --> 06:13:36.500
No, thank you.

3118
06:13:36.500 --> 06:13:44.500
I just wanted to thank you for your consideration in letting us bring in these people.

3119
06:13:44.500 --> 06:13:51.000
I think you should be a model for some of the other committees.

3120
06:13:51.000 --> 06:13:54.500
So I just wanted to thank you.

3121
06:13:54.500 --> 06:13:56.500
Thank you.

3122
06:13:56.500 --> 06:13:58.500
I appreciate that.

3123
06:13:58.500 --> 06:14:00.500
All right.

3124
06:14:00.500 --> 06:14:08.500
So I'll put that in an endless loop on my campaign page, if you don't mind.

3125
06:14:08.500 --> 06:14:10.500
All right.

3126
06:14:10.500 --> 06:14:16.000
But on a serious note, I don't see any other questions.

3127
06:14:16.000 --> 06:14:20.500
So we're finished with the guest portion of this.

3128
06:14:20.500 --> 06:14:29.500
And so let's just go back to a committee as a whole, or a division three, and Mr.

3129
06:14:29.500 --> 06:14:36.000
Ripple, the next time we meet, I think, is at noon on Friday.

3130
06:14:36.000 --> 06:14:38.500
Is that a true statement?

3131
06:14:38.500 --> 06:14:40.500
That's correct.

3132
06:14:40.500 --> 06:14:51.500
And the goal from noon to 2.30 on Friday is for us to take our first break and brush through HB 2.

3133
06:14:51.500 --> 06:14:58.000
And Representative Walner has nominated a topic that has been emailed to everyone.

3134
06:14:58.000 --> 06:15:00.000
We'll start with hers.

3135
06:15:00.000 --> 06:15:26.000
But the point of this is I think my objective is to have us touch every HB2 item that has come over in the budget proposal and make sure we know if we're comfortable with it as is or if we think that there may be something that needs to be tweaked.

3136
06:15:26.000 --> 06:15:31.000
I know there's been a few suggestions on some others.

3137
06:15:31.000 --> 06:15:35.000
I'll get organized so that we hit those.

3138
06:15:35.000 --> 06:15:47.500
But, but so I think we'll need all of the two and a half hours on Friday for HB2 is my guess and maybe more.

3139
06:15:47.500 --> 06:15:49.500
Any comment on that?

3140
06:15:49.500 --> 06:15:53.000
Your hand is still up, Representative Norgood.

3141
06:15:53.000 --> 06:15:55.000
okay all.

3142
06:15:55.000 --> 06:15:57.000
Well, last call.

3143
06:15:57.000 --> 06:15:59.000
I'm not seeing any.

3144
06:15:59.000 --> 06:16:02.500
So with that, I think we're adjourned.

3145
06:16:02.500 --> 06:16:05.500
So I appreciate everyone's time today.

3146
06:16:05.500 --> 06:16:07.500
Thank you.
