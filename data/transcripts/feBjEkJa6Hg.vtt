as we go into
 
00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
this next bill
 
00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:04.160 align:start position:0%
i'm trusting that it will continue this
 
00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
spirit that was so evident last year
 
00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:10.720 align:start position:0%
we can say what is our beliefs and why
 
00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
but we can be very respectful of people
 
00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
both with whom we are debating
 
00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:20.720 align:start position:0%
and also that a bill may
 
00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:22.160 align:start position:0%
have to do with
 
00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:24.400 align:start position:0%
so with that in mind
 
00:07:25.589 --> 00:07:25.599 align:start position:0%

as has been mentioned by the chair
 
00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
you have seen versions of this bill in

the past
 
00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:08.160 align:start position:0%

hb 295
 
00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:14.400 align:start position:0%

part of the part the biggest problem was
the

00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:46.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:50.080 align:start position:0%
form that was needed to help clerk the
 
00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:52.720 align:start position:0%
court and the vital records office was
 
00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
never created
 
00:08:57.829 --> 00:08:57.839 align:start position:0%
that's one of the primary reasons for
 
00:09:00.949 --> 00:09:00.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:04.389 --> 00:09:04.399 align:start position:0%
this bill does not create the ability
 
00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:06.800 align:start position:0%
for gender information to be corrected
 
00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
or changed on a birth record
 
00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:10.480 align:start position:0%
that ability
 
00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:14.240 align:start position:0%
was defined in that rsa and enacted
 
00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:14.949 align:start position:0%
was defined in that rsa and enacted
and

00:09:14.949 --> 00:09:14.959 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:17.680 align:start position:0%
enacted by our legislature and governor
 
00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:20.480 align:start position:0%
back in 2005.
 
00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:23.600 align:start position:0%
we are only requesting that procedures
 
00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
be put in place
 
00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:27.200 align:start position:0%
and update some of the things that we've
 
00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
noted over the past for those
 
00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:32.720 align:start position:0%
people on the line who are unfamiliar
 
00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:37.200 align:start position:0%
with what rsa 5-c colon 87 roman numeral
 
00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:38.560 align:start position:0%
5 says
 
00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:42.240 align:start position:0%
it's essentially a single sentence
 
00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:45.360 align:start position:0%
upon receipt of a certified copy of a
 
00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:47.680 align:start position:0%
court order advising that such
 
00:09:49.829 --> 00:09:49.839 align:start position:0%
individual born in the state of new
 
00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:53.040 align:start position:0%

00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:02.080 align:start position:0%
the missing part

to that rsa
 
00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:05.360 align:start position:0%

this is no information for what is
 
00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
required by the court
 
00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:12.080 align:start position:0%
or the clerk
 
00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:18.389 align:start position:0%
 
i

00:10:18.389 --> 00:10:18.399 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:20.560 align:start position:0%
in working with a number of people who
 
00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:26.389 --> 00:10:26.399 align:start position:0%
their information to be
 
00:10:26.399 --> 00:10:28.230 align:start position:0%
their information to be
updated

00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:28.240 align:start position:0%
updated
 
00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:30.800 align:start position:0%
we've run into some serious problems and
 
00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:32.720 align:start position:0%
very awkward for those people who have
 
00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:33.750 align:start position:0%
very awkward for those people who have
applied

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
applied
 
00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
because every county and clerk's office
 
00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
is different in the way they've
 
00:10:43.509 --> 00:10:43.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:46.720 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:10:49.509 --> 00:10:49.519 align:start position:0%
if we go to section 5
 
00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:51.200 align:start position:0%
in our rsas
 
00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:53.920 align:start position:0%
that are focused on on vital records the
 
00:10:57.110 --> 00:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
very first rsa
 
00:10:58.550 --> 00:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
defined that
 
00:11:00.949 --> 00:11:00.959 align:start position:0%
and any change to a birth record shall
 
00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:04.160 align:start position:0%
be initiated with the clerk
 
00:11:07.269 --> 00:11:07.279 align:start position:0%
of the town or city
 
00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:16.069 align:start position:0%
 
our

00:11:16.069 --> 00:11:16.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
our application our applicants
 
00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
have gone to their town or city clerk to
 
00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:25.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:27.760 align:start position:0%
they don't have a form there to fill out
 
00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
to collect the information
 
00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:32.320 align:start position:0%
that's required to help process the
 
00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:33.430 align:start position:0%
that's required to help process the
information

00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:33.440 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
and many times they'll get a blank stare
 
00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:37.360 align:start position:0%
from the clerk
 
00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:40.550 align:start position:0%
from the clerk
because

00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:42.720 align:start position:0%
the clerk may not
 
00:11:44.389 --> 00:11:44.399 align:start position:0%
know that that
 
00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:47.200 align:start position:0%
that they can actually do this
 
00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:49.120 align:start position:0%
and we've even had applicants turned
 
00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
away from the clerk's office
 
00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:53.200 align:start position:0%
because the clerk
 
00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:55.360 align:start position:0%
essentially has told them well we can't
 
00:11:57.750 --> 00:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
do this because there's no information
 
00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:00.560 align:start position:0%
available for them
 
00:12:01.829 --> 00:12:01.839 align:start position:0%
so the um
 
00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
the applicant ends up going to
 
00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:05.030 align:start position:0%
the applicant ends up going to
the

00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:12:07.269 --> 00:12:07.279 align:start position:0%
county court
 
00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
to ask for a form
 
00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:11.440 align:start position:0%
and a request to talk with the judge
 
00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:13.680 align:start position:0%
there is no form
 
00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:15.040 align:start position:0%
in the county
 
00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:16.069 align:start position:0%
in the county
courts

00:12:16.069 --> 00:12:16.079 align:start position:0%
courts
 
00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
to fill out but they can get some time
 
00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
once you've seen once you go to the
 
00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:25.110 align:start position:0%
once you've seen once you go to the
judge

00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:25.120 align:start position:0%
judge
 
00:12:28.069 --> 00:12:28.079 align:start position:0%
if some of the judges have had these
 
00:12:30.949 --> 00:12:30.959 align:start position:0%
cases before and are very familiar with
 
00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:33.440 align:start position:0%
what they require for information and
 
00:12:35.269 --> 00:12:35.279 align:start position:0%
most of the times it's a simple letter
 
00:12:35.279 --> 00:12:36.069 align:start position:0%
most of the times it's a simple letter
from

00:12:36.069 --> 00:12:36.079 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:37.760 align:start position:0%
the doctor
 
00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:40.240 align:start position:0%
the applicant has been saying it's
 
00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
associated with the
 
00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:42.800 align:start position:0%
their sex
 
00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:45.200 align:start position:0%
change information
 
00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:47.920 align:start position:0%
and for other judges it could be two or
 
00:12:49.829 --> 00:12:49.839 align:start position:0%
three different visits
 
00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:52.160 align:start position:0%
for them to require the additional
 
00:12:54.389 --> 00:12:54.399 align:start position:0%
information and knowledge to make an
 
00:12:58.870 --> 00:12:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:00.629 --> 00:13:00.639 align:start position:0%
the form that should have been made
 
00:13:03.269 --> 00:13:03.279 align:start position:0%
available should have been created back
 
00:13:03.279 --> 00:13:04.190 align:start position:0%
available should have been created back
in

00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:04.200 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:17.829 align:start position:0%
 
the

00:13:17.829 --> 00:13:17.839 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
challenges in general is that new
 
00:13:21.269 --> 00:13:21.279 align:start position:0%
hampshire judges
 
00:13:23.269 --> 00:13:23.279 align:start position:0%
don't have the medical knowledge to make
 
00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:25.120 align:start position:0%
an informed decision
 
00:13:26.949 --> 00:13:26.959 align:start position:0%
they are totally reliant on the
 
00:13:29.829 --> 00:13:29.839 align:start position:0%
applicant providing information
 
00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:36.949 --> 00:13:36.959 align:start position:0%
and what we're seeing currently is that
 
00:13:38.949 --> 00:13:38.959 align:start position:0%
some judges who have seen this
 
00:13:38.959 --> 00:13:40.550 align:start position:0%
some judges who have seen this
information

00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
have processed these cases in the past
 
00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:45.440 align:start position:0%
they see the doctor's letter and they
 
00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:46.550 align:start position:0%
they see the doctor's letter and they
just

00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
issue the court order
 
00:13:51.269 --> 00:13:51.279 align:start position:0%
but it does require a court visit and
 
00:13:53.509 --> 00:13:53.519 align:start position:0%
time and effort for the applicant and
 
00:13:59.430 --> 00:13:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:01.509 --> 00:14:01.519 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:14:03.829 --> 00:14:03.839 align:start position:0%
in the in the case of the the original
 
00:14:03.839 --> 00:14:06.629 align:start position:0%
in the in the case of the the original
rsa

00:14:06.629 --> 00:14:06.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:06.639 --> 00:14:07.590 align:start position:0%
 
a

00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:07.600 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:09.760 align:start position:0%
court order would be issued and a birth
 
00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:12.240 align:start position:0%
certificate would be issued by the vital
 
00:14:14.829 --> 00:14:14.839 align:start position:0%
records office
 
00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:18.160 align:start position:0%
that birth record that was issued by
 
00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
court order does not have a marginal
 
00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:23.120 align:start position:0%
note on it
 
00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
they are essentially replacing
 
00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:27.040 align:start position:0%
the birth record
 
00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
with a new birth record with no pointer
 
00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:33.760 align:start position:0%
back to an original
 
00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:36.880 align:start position:0%
what we are asking for with this request
 
00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:42.240 align:start position:0%
a new birth record be issued but it will
 
00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
have a marginal note that points back to
 
00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:47.120 align:start position:0%
the original
 
00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:48.800 align:start position:0%
birth record
 
00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:49.829 align:start position:0%
birth record
that's

00:14:49.829 --> 00:14:49.839 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:14:53.269 --> 00:14:53.279 align:start position:0%
on our vital record system
 
00:14:55.990 --> 00:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
i will tell you many of the transgender
 
00:14:59.030 --> 00:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
community is not happy with that
 
00:14:59.040 --> 00:14:59.990 align:start position:0%
community is not happy with that
but

00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:02.480 align:start position:0%
they can still go back to the court to
 
00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:04.480 align:start position:0%
get a court order
 
00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:07.040 align:start position:0%
and issue a birth record that does not
 
00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:15:17.189 --> 00:15:17.199 align:start position:0%
challenge here is that it's whole
 
00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
time-consuming effort
 
00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:21.360 align:start position:0%
for the applicant
 
00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:24.240 align:start position:0%
our courts and the clerk's office and it
 
00:15:28.629 --> 00:15:28.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
i will reiterate the prime focus of this
 
00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:32.310 align:start position:0%
i will reiterate the prime focus of this
bill

00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:32.320 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:15:34.629 --> 00:15:34.639 align:start position:0%
is not to change the intent of the
 
00:15:40.069 --> 00:15:40.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:42.069 --> 00:15:42.079 align:start position:0%
the intent of this bill
 
00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:44.480 align:start position:0%
is about saving the state
 
00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
in simple
 
00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:52.480 align:start position:0%
in simple terms a birth record change
 
00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
form needs to be created
 
00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:56.800 align:start position:0%
that identifies all of the applicant's
 
00:15:59.829 --> 00:15:59.839 align:start position:0%
personal information
 
00:16:02.389 --> 00:16:02.399 align:start position:0%
needed by the vital records office
 
00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:04.720 align:start position:0%
to make the changes
 
00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:07.680 align:start position:0%
the form also needs a section to be
 
00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:09.680 align:start position:0%
signed and notarized by one of the
 
00:16:11.829 --> 00:16:11.839 align:start position:0%

00:16:24.949 --> 00:16:24.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:27.189 --> 00:16:27.199 align:start position:0%
it needs to have all this information
 
00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
the physician the physician's
 
00:16:34.629 --> 00:16:34.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:36.629 --> 00:16:36.639 align:start position:0%
one thing to note
 
00:16:36.639 --> 00:16:37.590 align:start position:0%
one thing to note
um

00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:37.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
a person that's going through a sex
 
00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:41.680 align:start position:0%

00:16:59.590 --> 00:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
similar procedures have been going on in
 
00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:01.680 align:start position:0%
20 states
 
00:17:03.749 --> 00:17:03.759 align:start position:0%
the process reduces
 
00:17:05.669 --> 00:17:05.679 align:start position:0%
the court workflow
 
00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
and we have quite a workload
 
00:17:11.189 --> 00:17:11.199 align:start position:0%
for it essentially overworked
 
00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
there is no financial note attached to
 
00:17:23.189 --> 00:17:23.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:25.429 --> 00:17:25.439 align:start position:0%
we are not adding non-binary people to
 
00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:26.640 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:17:28.549 --> 00:17:28.559 align:start position:0%
i've been asked to include non-binary
 
00:17:28.559 --> 00:17:29.510 align:start position:0%
i've been asked to include non-binary
people

00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:31.520 align:start position:0%
i know the problems with that
 
00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:34.160 align:start position:0%
it would cost a hundred thousand dollars
 
00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
in software cost
 
00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:38.640 align:start position:0%
to enact that
 
00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:40.640 align:start position:0%
this has no financial note
 
00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:42.160 align:start position:0%
the software
 
00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:44.960 align:start position:0%
can already do what's being requested
 
00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:47.360 align:start position:0%
and they are currently using it many
 
00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:49.520 align:start position:0%
people have already
 
00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:52.480 align:start position:0%
filed for their sex change and corrected
 
00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:55.440 align:start position:0%
their birth certificates
 
00:17:57.510 --> 00:17:57.520 align:start position:0%
i encourage you to vote

people when people want to change
 
00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:55.280 align:start position:0%

do they have to jump through the same
 
00:18:58.400 --> 00:18:59.430 align:start position:0%
do they have to jump through the same
hoops

00:18:59.430 --> 00:18:59.440 align:start position:0%
hoops
 
00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:00.640 align:start position:0%
as this
 
00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:02.320 align:start position:0%
or what is their process if they're
 
00:19:05.470 --> 00:19:05.480 align:start position:0%
changing a name or
 
00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:08.840 align:start position:0%
a father's name or a mother's name or
 
00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:12.160 align:start position:0%
whatever the forms already exist to do
 
00:19:14.789 --> 00:19:14.799 align:start position:0%
that in the clerk's office
 
00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:16.720 align:start position:0%
they don't have to go to the court it's
 
00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
uh it's processed in the court office
 
00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:20.960 align:start position:0%
and then sent to the vital records
 
00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:24.000 align:start position:0%

um follow-up yes follow-up
 
00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:31.280 align:start position:0%
um so basically you're just asking that
 
00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:33.440 align:start position:0%
the same form
 
00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
being created and maintained
 
00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:36.870 align:start position:0%
being created and maintained
for

00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:40.480 align:start position:0%

that's in addition to the current forms
 
00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
is to provide a section
 
00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:52.000 align:start position:0%
for a physician to sign off and notarize
 
00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:53.600 align:start position:0%

said that currently
 
00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:19.760 align:start position:0%
a problem is that the forum
 
00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't exist or is inadequate
 
00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:24.640 align:start position:0%
and i'm looking at the bill and i'm not
 
00:20:27.029 --> 00:20:27.039 align:start position:0%
really seeing anything about the
 
00:20:27.039 --> 00:20:28.470 align:start position:0%
really seeing anything about the
creation

00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:28.480 align:start position:0%
creation
 
00:20:30.149 --> 00:20:30.159 align:start position:0%
of a form
 
00:20:30.159 --> 00:20:33.430 align:start position:0%
of a form
it

00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:35.029 --> 00:20:35.039 align:start position:0%
the form should have been
 
00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:38.320 align:start position:0%
created back when the original rsa was
 
00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
was um
 
00:20:42.789 --> 00:20:42.799 align:start position:0%
created that i i don't know if there was
 
00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:44.640 align:start position:0%
anything in that bill about the creation
 
00:20:46.149 --> 00:20:46.159 align:start position:0%
that reform
 
00:20:46.159 --> 00:20:46.950 align:start position:0%
that reform
um

00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
the information being there is a section
 
00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
that's that defines what's required for
 
00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
a physician to sign and have attest to
 
00:20:58.789 --> 00:20:58.799 align:start position:0%
the thing i i did not identify the
 
00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:01.360 align:start position:0%
specifics of the of a form because we
 
00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
there are already forms that do this we
 
00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:06.720 align:start position:0%
we already have a form that contains
 
00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
essentially the same information
 
00:21:12.549 --> 00:21:12.559 align:start position:0%
that our dmv requires to change a gender
 
00:21:16.149 --> 00:21:16.159 align:start position:0%
id on a on a driver's license the
 
00:21:18.549 --> 00:21:18.559 align:start position:0%
federal government has a form to change
 
00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
that information
 
00:21:22.549 --> 00:21:22.559 align:start position:0%
on our passports
 
00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:24.480 align:start position:0%
the nashua
 
00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:27.440 align:start position:0%
city clerk had indicated that they could
 
00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:31.200 align:start position:0%
create a form simply for for their
 
00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
clerk's office and that form could be
 
00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:36.240 align:start position:0%
used elsewhere
 
00:21:39.029 --> 00:21:39.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:42.320 align:start position:0%
representative acton for a question
 
00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
representative spain for taking my
 
00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:46.950 align:start position:0%
representative spain for taking my
question

00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:46.960 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:48.549 align:start position:0%
question
um

00:21:48.549 --> 00:21:48.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
last year
 
00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:52.720 align:start position:0%
when we went over this subject there was
 
00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:55.200 align:start position:0%
some pushback as far as
 
00:21:56.789 --> 00:21:56.799 align:start position:0%
not having
 
00:21:59.430 --> 00:21:59.440 align:start position:0%
a marker that designated
 
00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:01.200 align:start position:0%
that there was a change in the records
 
00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:04.240 align:start position:0%
and that could possibly throw off
 
00:22:07.029 --> 00:22:07.039 align:start position:0%
um physicians or statisticians because
 
00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:09.200 align:start position:0%
um because there was no
 
00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:11.200 align:start position:0%
indicator of a change in the birth
 
00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:13.120 align:start position:0%
certificate is this
 
00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:13.830 align:start position:0%
certificate is this
a

00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:13.840 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:16.720 align:start position:0%
compromise to address those
 
00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:17.909 align:start position:0%
compromise to address those
issues

00:22:17.909 --> 00:22:17.919 align:start position:0%
issues
 
00:22:19.029 --> 00:22:19.039 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:22.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:24.549 --> 00:22:24.559 align:start position:0%
it was identified by the
 
00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
vital records office that if we changed
 
00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:30.480 align:start position:0%
the if we
 
00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:33.200 align:start position:0%
if we modified a birth record without a
 
00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
court order they would include a
 
00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
marginal record pointing back to the
 
00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:39.520 align:start position:0%
original birth certificate in the
 
00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
current version in the current rsa
 
00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:46.880 align:start position:0%
when it is is issued by a court order
 
00:22:49.669 --> 00:22:49.679 align:start position:0%
there is no marginal note and the birth
 
00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
the original birth record does not have
 
00:22:54.549 --> 00:22:54.559 align:start position:0%
to be maintained so in the case of the
 
00:22:57.430 --> 00:22:57.440 align:start position:0%
concern that an original birth record
 
00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:00.880 align:start position:0%
would be destroyed or made non-existent
 
00:23:02.070 --> 00:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:04.480 align:start position:0%
actually confirms that that birth record
 
00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:07.120 align:start position:0%
will still continue to exist on the
 
00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:14.240 align:start position:0%
okay uh
 
00:23:17.029 --> 00:23:17.039 align:start position:0%
i think it's one thing to go down to the
 
00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:18.640 align:start position:0%
clerk's office and
 
00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:20.400 align:start position:0%
change your car registration it's
 
00:23:22.549 --> 00:23:22.559 align:start position:0%
obviously much more
 
00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:25.360 align:start position:0%
personal situation um would would
 
00:23:27.909 --> 00:23:27.919 align:start position:0%
rectifying the situation saved
 
00:23:29.909 --> 00:23:29.919 align:start position:0%
so it must be rather embarrassing to
 
00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:32.000 align:start position:0%
walk in there to have the
 
00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
personal information then get a
 
00:23:38.549 --> 00:23:38.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:40.549 --> 00:23:40.559 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i i couldn't make out
 
00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:42.320 align:start position:0%
everything you said could you repeat
 
00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:44.640 align:start position:0%
your question
 
00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:45.750 align:start position:0%
your question
basically

00:23:45.750 --> 00:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
basically
 
00:23:49.110 --> 00:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
i'm acknowledging that what must be
 
00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:52.240 align:start position:0%
rather humiliating to walk into
 
00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:54.640 align:start position:0%
the office and have to get a run around
 
00:23:55.909 --> 00:23:55.919 align:start position:0%
it's not like you're switching
 
00:23:58.070 --> 00:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
registration place
 
00:23:59.590 --> 00:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:01.760 align:start position:0%
i will will
 
00:24:05.029 --> 00:24:05.039 align:start position:0%
the passage of this bill rectify
 
00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
the situation where people are being
 
00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
humiliated during
 
00:24:12.549 --> 00:24:12.559 align:start position:0%
an interaction with government
 
00:24:12.559 --> 00:24:14.470 align:start position:0%
an interaction with government
um

00:24:14.470 --> 00:24:14.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
in some cases especially someone who is
 
00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:18.870 align:start position:0%
in some cases especially someone who is
um

00:24:18.870 --> 00:24:18.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:21.200 align:start position:0%
has not been out in public for a long
 
00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
time however
 
00:24:25.029 --> 00:24:25.039 align:start position:0%
to have undergone the the changes to
 
00:24:27.750 --> 00:24:27.760 align:start position:0%
their gender
 
00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:30.320 align:start position:0%
the current requirement from the medical
 
00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
field is that they be out in public and
 
00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
living their life true to the gender
 
00:24:39.029 --> 00:24:39.039 align:start position:0%
they identify with for at least a year
 
00:24:41.669 --> 00:24:41.679 align:start position:0%
and physicians would like two or years
 
00:24:41.679 --> 00:24:42.870 align:start position:0%
and physicians would like two or years
more

00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:42.880 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:24:45.029 --> 00:24:45.039 align:start position:0%
when i applied for
 
00:24:46.390 --> 00:24:46.400 align:start position:0%
my gender
 
00:24:49.269 --> 00:24:49.279 align:start position:0%
change information in massachusetts a
 
00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
few years ago
 
00:24:54.549 --> 00:24:54.559 align:start position:0%
i had been out in public for 15 years
 
00:24:57.269 --> 00:24:57.279 align:start position:0%
so it was no issue for me
 
00:25:00.549 --> 00:25:00.559 align:start position:0%
and for younger people
 
00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:04.640 align:start position:0%
who get this information changed
 
00:25:05.830 --> 00:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
and even
 
00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:08.640 align:start position:0%
someone who's under the year age of 18
 
00:25:10.710 --> 00:25:10.720 align:start position:0%
along with their parents
 
00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:13.760 align:start position:0%
is in most cases these people are so
 
00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
excited about getting this information
 
00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:20.960 align:start position:0%
changed to make their life easier
 
00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
primarily for themselves because a birth
 
00:25:26.789 --> 00:25:26.799 align:start position:0%
certificate is rarely used
 
00:25:26.799 --> 00:25:27.510 align:start position:0%
certificate is rarely used
for

00:25:27.510 --> 00:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:25:28.390 --> 00:25:28.400 align:start position:0%
for other
 
00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:29.430 align:start position:0%
for other
um

00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:29.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:31.440 align:start position:0%
other information changes
 
00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:32.630 align:start position:0%
other information changes
um

00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:32.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:35.350 --> 00:25:35.360 align:start position:0%
but a passport is one of those things
 
00:25:37.669 --> 00:25:37.679 align:start position:0%
that could be required but
 
00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:40.320 align:start position:0%
but now with the proper form
 
00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:43.840 align:start position:0%
an individual can go get that changed
 
00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:45.350 align:start position:0%
an individual can go get that changed
um

00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:45.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:47.750 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:50.549 --> 00:25:50.559 align:start position:0%
does it impact some people
 
00:25:53.029 --> 00:25:53.039 align:start position:0%
yes um
 
00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:55.440 align:start position:0%
i know that i was very concerned when i
 
00:25:56.950 --> 00:25:56.960 align:start position:0%
was first
 
00:25:59.190 --> 00:25:59.200 align:start position:0%
coming out as a transgender person
 
00:26:03.029 --> 00:26:03.039 align:start position:0%
to have to tell someone that i was a
 
00:26:05.909 --> 00:26:05.919 align:start position:0%
transgender individual
 
00:26:08.950 --> 00:26:08.960 align:start position:0%
can be a very awkward situation
 
00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
it's not anymore
 
00:26:13.990 --> 00:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
i'm an elk person so but a lot of people
 
00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.549 align:start position:0%
i'm an elk person so but a lot of people
aren't

00:26:16.549 --> 00:26:16.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:19.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:22.710 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
representative

00:26:22.710 --> 00:26:22.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:24.710 --> 00:26:24.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
 
00:26:27.510 --> 00:26:27.520 align:start position:0%
i want to come back to the uh question
 
00:26:29.430 --> 00:26:29.440 align:start position:0%
that representative shapiro asked and
 
00:26:31.110 --> 00:26:31.120 align:start position:0%
delve a little deeper
 
00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:33.909 align:start position:0%
delve a little deeper
um

00:26:33.909 --> 00:26:33.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:35.669 --> 00:26:35.679 align:start position:0%
first of all it's like who actually
 
00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
prepares this form is it going to be
 
00:26:39.909 --> 00:26:39.919 align:start position:0%
done by the town clerk of the state and
 
00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
given that issue then do we need to
 
00:26:45.110 --> 00:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
state that the clerk of each town shall
 
00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:47.360 align:start position:0%
create such a form or do we need to
 
00:26:51.269 --> 00:26:51.279 align:start position:0%
authorize rule making for the state to
 
00:26:53.029 --> 00:26:53.039 align:start position:0%
develop this form i just want to make
 
00:26:54.310 --> 00:26:54.320 align:start position:0%
sure that that doesn't fall through the
 
00:26:56.870 --> 00:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
cracks another time
 
00:26:58.870 --> 00:26:58.880 align:start position:0%
um good point
 
00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:00.720 align:start position:0%
um first off i don't think it should be
 
00:27:02.549 --> 00:27:02.559 align:start position:0%
done by
 
00:27:02.559 --> 00:27:03.990 align:start position:0%
done by
well

00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:04.000 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:27:06.149 --> 00:27:06.159 align:start position:0%
i know that we had a city clerk offered
 
00:27:08.470 --> 00:27:08.480 align:start position:0%
to do this to create a form that could
 
00:27:10.950 --> 00:27:10.960 align:start position:0%
be put online for all to use
 
00:27:13.029 --> 00:27:13.039 align:start position:0%
i think we need to have something that's
 
00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:16.320 align:start position:0%
approved by the state for use in all of
 
00:27:18.149 --> 00:27:18.159 align:start position:0%
our clerk's offices
 
00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:20.720 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if it requires a rule to do
 
00:27:22.630 --> 00:27:22.640 align:start position:0%
that or
 
00:27:25.590 --> 00:27:25.600 align:start position:0%
if i should put uh amend this text to
 
00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:27.440 align:start position:0%
include that as something that needs to
 
00:27:28.390 --> 00:27:28.400 align:start position:0%
be done
 
00:27:29.669 --> 00:27:29.679 align:start position:0%
and and
 
00:27:31.830 --> 00:27:31.840 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure who to identify to do that
 
00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:32.630 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure who to identify to do that
so

00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:32.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:34.720 align:start position:0%
yeah it affects all the clerks so if
 
00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:44.149 --> 00:27:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:50.070 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:50.080 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:52.720 align:start position:0%
i don't see gary i think we've lost the
 
00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:55.360 align:start position:0%
uh oh no we lost him
 
00:27:57.190 --> 00:27:57.200 align:start position:0%
yes yes we're working on getting it
 
00:28:00.389 --> 00:28:00.399 align:start position:0%
turned back on i think they're frozen um
 
00:28:02.389 --> 00:28:02.399 align:start position:0%
and i'll see what i can do well i'll
 
00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
just assume he's going to give me
 
00:28:05.269 --> 00:28:05.279 align:start position:0%
authority i i would think that we would
 
00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:07.200 align:start position:0%
at least want to give it they can't hear
 
00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
you they can't they can't hear you you
 
00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
should wait
 
00:28:11.830 --> 00:28:11.840 align:start position:0%
well i'll say this isn't more an answer
 
00:28:13.430 --> 00:28:13.440 align:start position:0%
i think rule making authority for vital
 
00:28:15.029 --> 00:28:15.039 align:start position:0%
records to do i did have a follow-up
 
00:28:16.950 --> 00:28:16.960 align:start position:0%
question but i'll wait till we see
 
00:28:18.789 --> 00:28:18.799 align:start position:0%
people's faces back
 
00:28:20.789 --> 00:28:20.799 align:start position:0%

00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:24.470 align:start position:0%
does do your ducks lay eggs

00:28:27.190 --> 00:28:27.200 align:start position:0%
yes we gotta get about the egg delete
 
00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:30.310 align:start position:0%
yes we gotta get about the egg delete
okay

i'll email you something later thanks
 
00:28:33.590 --> 00:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:28:35.669 --> 00:28:35.679 align:start position:0%
representative snow
 
00:28:38.549 --> 00:28:38.559 align:start position:0%
this is beth the clerk um if you could
 
00:28:42.070 --> 00:28:42.080 align:start position:0%
unmute during this time and
 
00:28:44.950 --> 00:28:44.960 align:start position:0%
tell me where you are i am now unmuted
 
00:28:47.510 --> 00:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
and i should also say i was held up this
 
00:28:49.909 --> 00:28:49.919 align:start position:0%
morning and i didn't get a chance to say
 
00:28:52.389 --> 00:28:52.399 align:start position:0%
that i'm in i'm in my apartment in
 
00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
manchester my wife is in the building
 
00:28:57.990 --> 00:28:58.000 align:start position:0%
and i will be here i may have to leave
 
00:29:00.389 --> 00:29:00.399 align:start position:0%
proportion because my second vaccination
 
00:29:02.389 --> 00:29:02.399 align:start position:0%
shot is going to be administered here at
 
00:29:06.789 --> 00:29:06.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:11.510 --> 00:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:15.909 --> 00:29:15.919 align:start position:0%
is is our assistant chair available
 
00:29:18.070 --> 00:29:18.080 align:start position:0%
representative in the room
 
00:29:20.149 --> 00:29:20.159 align:start position:0%
he's in the room
 
00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:22.480 align:start position:0%
but we've lost the room is that correct
 
00:29:24.950 --> 00:29:24.960 align:start position:0%
yeah apparently yeah and bill is on his
 
00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
computer so he's not it's not the system
 
00:29:31.990 --> 00:29:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:35.029 --> 00:29:35.039 align:start position:0%
just an observation
 
00:29:35.039 --> 00:29:35.990 align:start position:0%
just an observation
i

00:29:35.990 --> 00:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:29:37.909 --> 00:29:37.919 align:start position:0%
cannot access
 
00:29:40.389 --> 00:29:40.399 align:start position:0%
the session on my computer
 
00:29:42.789 --> 00:29:42.799 align:start position:0%
i'm on my phone
 
00:29:45.830 --> 00:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to assume that comcast
 
00:29:49.669 --> 00:29:49.679 align:start position:0%
lines are down in my area
 
00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:52.840 align:start position:0%
and i'm over a phone line
 
00:29:56.230 --> 00:29:56.240 align:start position:0%
um so i and i'm going to assume that
 
00:29:58.549 --> 00:29:58.559 align:start position:0%
there are other people on the committee
 
00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:05.990 --> 00:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
is that correct i will add that my i had
 
00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:09.440 align:start position:0%
a power blip here in wilton that lasted
 
00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:11.360 align:start position:0%
probably a second or two but it was
 
00:30:14.789 --> 00:30:14.799 align:start position:0%
enough that my router had to reset
 
00:30:17.590 --> 00:30:17.600 align:start position:0%
so i was gone from the meeting for
 
00:30:20.310 --> 00:30:20.320 align:start position:0%
probably three or four minutes
 
00:30:24.230 --> 00:30:24.240 align:start position:0%
um so yeah sometimes even a a momentary
 
00:30:27.110 --> 00:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
power outage can lead to
 
00:30:31.110 --> 00:30:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:32.549 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:30:32.549 --> 00:30:32.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:32.559 --> 00:30:33.350 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:33.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:35.190 align:start position:0%
so
my

00:30:35.190 --> 00:30:35.200 align:start position:0%
my
 
00:30:36.950 --> 00:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
oh okay
 
00:30:40.149 --> 00:30:40.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:40.159 --> 00:30:41.110 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:41.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:42.710 --> 00:30:42.720 align:start position:0%
well i wonder oh
 
00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
awesome that not none of the attendees
 
00:30:46.950 --> 00:30:46.960 align:start position:0%
can see or hear what we're
 
00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:49.190 align:start position:0%
can see or hear what we're
right

00:30:49.190 --> 00:30:49.200 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:30:52.389 --> 00:30:52.399 align:start position:0%
yeah uh hey christina just a curiosity
 
00:30:54.549 --> 00:30:54.559 align:start position:0%
are you are you in the room with them or
 
00:30:55.350 --> 00:30:55.360 align:start position:0%
are you
 
00:30:55.360 --> 00:31:02.389 align:start position:0%
are you
remote

00:31:02.389 --> 00:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:05.600 align:start position:0%
or not i'm actually remote so um okay
 
00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
yeah that's because i just texted bill
 
00:31:09.350 --> 00:31:09.360 align:start position:0%
marsh to find out what you know what's
 
00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:11.120 align:start position:0%
going on i mean whether they just had a
 
00:31:12.630 --> 00:31:12.640 align:start position:0%
power blip or whether they're totally
 
00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:14.000 align:start position:0%
without power
 
00:31:16.149 --> 00:31:16.159 align:start position:0%
he hasn't answered back yet
 
00:31:19.190 --> 00:31:19.200 align:start position:0%
um so my understanding um just from
 
00:31:23.029 --> 00:31:23.039 align:start position:0%
my colleagues is that um
 
00:31:25.029 --> 00:31:25.039 align:start position:0%
the ethernet went down the building so
 
00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:29.120 align:start position:0%
they'll have to bring it back up shortly
 
00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:30.080 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:31:32.950 --> 00:31:32.960 align:start position:0%
why are we looking at amendments for
 
00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:42.470 align:start position:0%
why are we looking at amendments for
hb220

00:31:42.470 --> 00:31:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:46.470 --> 00:31:46.480 align:start position:0%
what was that joe you're muted now
 
00:31:48.310 --> 00:31:48.320 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden i saw an amendment and i
 
00:31:50.149 --> 00:31:50.159 align:start position:0%
assumed it was screen sharing but i
 
00:31:52.789 --> 00:31:52.799 align:start position:0%
think what actually happened is that i
 
00:31:55.350 --> 00:31:55.360 align:start position:0%
lost something and this was underneath
 
00:31:57.750 --> 00:31:57.760 align:start position:0%
oh got it yeah i'll figure it out
 
00:32:00.149 --> 00:32:00.159 align:start position:0%
you had me nervous
 
00:32:02.070 --> 00:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
well we go back to the ducks back to
 
00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:06.630 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:32:06.630 --> 00:32:06.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:32:09.430 --> 00:32:09.440 align:start position:0%
so i hear duck eggs make the best cakes
 
00:32:13.350 --> 00:32:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:14.710 --> 00:32:14.720 align:start position:0%
they're great for baking they have a
 
00:32:17.110 --> 00:32:17.120 align:start position:0%
nice rich flavor to them
 
00:32:19.590 --> 00:32:19.600 align:start position:0%
that's what i heard so
 
00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
if you could ever spare two eggs i would
 
00:32:31.029 --> 00:32:31.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:34.070 --> 00:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:36.230 --> 00:32:36.240 align:start position:0%
that is astounding only only in this
 
00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
committee can you get such good
 
00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:40.630 align:start position:0%
committee can you get such good
information

00:32:40.630 --> 00:32:40.640 align:start position:0%

that would be virtual coffee
 
00:32:52.230 --> 00:32:52.240 align:start position:0%

00:37:41.670 --> 00:37:41.680 align:start position:0%
thank you very much i don't know where
 
00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:42.710 align:start position:0%
thank you very much i don't know where
from

00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:42.720 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:37:44.950 --> 00:37:44.960 align:start position:0%
yes all right no thank you very much my
 
00:37:46.710 --> 00:37:46.720 align:start position:0%
um where'd i put the bill there it is
 
00:37:49.109 --> 00:37:49.119 align:start position:0%
okay so yeah i had a follow-up question
 
00:37:51.829 --> 00:37:51.839 align:start position:0%
that was just an issue that
 
00:37:53.430 --> 00:37:53.440 align:start position:0%
on page seven when we talk about the
 
00:37:55.270 --> 00:37:55.280 align:start position:0%
notarized certification signed by a
 
00:37:57.750 --> 00:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
licensed qualified health care provider
 
00:38:00.230 --> 00:38:00.240 align:start position:0%
i'm just wondering is requiring it to be
 
00:38:02.829 --> 00:38:02.839 align:start position:0%
notarized as
 
00:38:06.630 --> 00:38:06.640 align:start position:0%
a bar which might be quite difficult to
 
00:38:08.470 --> 00:38:08.480 align:start position:0%
achieve because for many providers in
 
00:38:11.190 --> 00:38:11.200 align:start position:0%
the office there's no notary there and
 
00:38:13.109 --> 00:38:13.119 align:start position:0%
for them to take time out and go to a
 
00:38:15.270 --> 00:38:15.280 align:start position:0%
notary to get that notarized
 
00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:17.280 align:start position:0%
seems like a burden that is higher than
 
00:38:19.829 --> 00:38:19.839 align:start position:0%
we place on any of these other
 
00:38:19.839 --> 00:38:20.630 align:start position:0%
we place on any of these other
uh

00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:20.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:38:22.710 --> 00:38:22.720 align:start position:0%
record changes is that is it a higher
 
00:38:24.310 --> 00:38:24.320 align:start position:0%
burden or not is it something that we
 
00:38:26.390 --> 00:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
should maintain or should we make it a
 
00:38:29.270 --> 00:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
little less of a burden
 
00:38:34.470 --> 00:38:34.480 align:start position:0%
um i agree it's a burden um it at the um
 
00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:36.800 align:start position:0%
i know some people were concerned that
 
00:38:38.630 --> 00:38:38.640 align:start position:0%
someone would sign the form with some
 
00:38:41.190 --> 00:38:41.200 align:start position:0%
information that may be invalid and it
 
00:38:43.990 --> 00:38:44.000 align:start position:0%
may be a forged signature and that by
 
00:38:45.270 --> 00:38:45.280 align:start position:0%
having it
 
00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:47.030 align:start position:0%
having it
notarized

00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
notarized
 
00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:49.910 align:start position:0%
notarized
essentially

00:38:49.910 --> 00:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:52.150 --> 00:38:52.160 align:start position:0%
the statement that it was reviewed by
 
00:38:57.430 --> 00:38:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:01.510 --> 00:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
when i got my information changed for
 
00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:02.390 align:start position:0%
when i got my information changed for
the

00:39:02.390 --> 00:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:39:04.550 --> 00:39:04.560 align:start position:0%
for the state of massachusetts
 
00:39:05.990 --> 00:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
as well as
 
00:39:08.390 --> 00:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
to get my passport changed
 
00:39:11.510 --> 00:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
they wanted to see a notarized form
 
00:39:14.550 --> 00:39:14.560 align:start position:0%
so i felt this was appropriate but i
 
00:39:17.190 --> 00:39:17.200 align:start position:0%
also know that for me to get a physician
 
00:39:20.550 --> 00:39:20.560 align:start position:0%
to change my to put sign the form in
 
00:39:23.670 --> 00:39:23.680 align:start position:0%
front of a notary that it cost me
 
00:39:25.990 --> 00:39:26.000 align:start position:0%
seventy dollars up there
 
00:39:29.589 --> 00:39:29.599 align:start position:0%
to pay for their time to go to a notary
 
00:39:32.310 --> 00:39:32.320 align:start position:0%
now i've heard from others where someone
 
00:39:34.630 --> 00:39:34.640 align:start position:0%
within the physician's office
 
00:39:37.589 --> 00:39:37.599 align:start position:0%
has been a notary and can and can do
 
00:39:39.109 --> 00:39:39.119 align:start position:0%
that for them
 
00:39:41.910 --> 00:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
and as a follow-up to you yeah as a
 
00:39:45.430 --> 00:39:45.440 align:start position:0%
follow-up to your question about forms
 
00:39:47.190 --> 00:39:47.200 align:start position:0%
over the past two years when we were
 
00:39:49.910 --> 00:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
discussing a similar bills
 
00:39:52.710 --> 00:39:52.720 align:start position:0%
the vital records office was working
 
00:39:55.109 --> 00:39:55.119 align:start position:0%
hand-in-hand with the nashua clerk's
 
00:39:58.310 --> 00:39:58.320 align:start position:0%
office to develop a form
 
00:40:01.349 --> 00:40:01.359 align:start position:0%
so i i don't think it would be a problem
 
00:40:03.270 --> 00:40:03.280 align:start position:0%
for me to go back to those individuals
 
00:40:05.270 --> 00:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
who divide our records office and say
 
00:40:07.510 --> 00:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
continue the effort that you started
 
00:40:09.670 --> 00:40:09.680 align:start position:0%
over the past two years just complete
 
00:40:11.510 --> 00:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
that form and then make it available
 
00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:12.630 align:start position:0%
that form and then make it available
online

00:40:12.630 --> 00:40:12.640 align:start position:0%
online
 
00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
and available to the court to the
 
00:40:16.710 --> 00:40:16.720 align:start position:0%
clerk's office
 
00:40:19.270 --> 00:40:19.280 align:start position:0%

representative cannon for letting me

know the description of the history of
 
00:41:28.550 --> 00:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
this bill and the desire really to try
 
00:41:30.230 --> 00:41:30.240 align:start position:0%
to streamline the process of the
 
00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:31.670 align:start position:0%
to streamline the process of the
documentation

00:41:31.670 --> 00:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
documentation
 
00:41:32.870 --> 00:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
i just had a
 
00:41:34.150 --> 00:41:34.160 align:start position:0%
couple of questions regarding the
 
00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:36.240 align:start position:0%
language of the bill i have just three
 
00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:38.160 align:start position:0%
points that i'd like to make and please
 
00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:39.510 align:start position:0%
points that i'd like to make and please
um

00:41:39.510 --> 00:41:39.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:41.910 --> 00:41:41.920 align:start position:0%
stop me at any point um but i've been
 
00:41:43.510 --> 00:41:43.520 align:start position:0%
hearing a lot of
 
00:41:46.230 --> 00:41:46.240 align:start position:0%
interchange between the words sex and
 
00:41:48.870 --> 00:41:48.880 align:start position:0%
gender and i was just kind of curious
 
00:41:50.550 --> 00:41:50.560 align:start position:0%
about that a little bit
 
00:41:52.470 --> 00:41:52.480 align:start position:0%
more um
 
00:41:53.430 --> 00:41:53.440 align:start position:0%
just to hear a little bit more about
 
00:41:55.349 --> 00:41:55.359 align:start position:0%
that because in the bill the analysis
 
00:41:59.030 --> 00:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
section speaks to sex and then the body
 
00:42:01.109 --> 00:42:01.119 align:start position:0%
refers to gender
 
00:42:03.109 --> 00:42:03.119 align:start position:0%
and i just wasn't sure represent ken i
 
00:42:03.119 --> 00:42:03.910 align:start position:0%
and i just wasn't sure represent ken i
think

00:42:03.910 --> 00:42:03.920 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:42:05.349 --> 00:42:05.359 align:start position:0%
you were you were referring to people
 
00:42:07.109 --> 00:42:07.119 align:start position:0%
that have had sex change operations so
 
00:42:09.109 --> 00:42:09.119 align:start position:0%
we're talking about um
 
00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
changes to anatomy versus
 
00:42:14.710 --> 00:42:14.720 align:start position:0%
um the more fluid kind of expression of
 
00:42:18.870 --> 00:42:18.880 align:start position:0%
gender so i just was curious about that
 
00:42:21.430 --> 00:42:21.440 align:start position:0%
about that in the bill
 
00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:23.030 align:start position:0%
about that in the bill
because

00:42:23.030 --> 00:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:42:27.190 --> 00:42:27.200 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering about the changes from
 
00:42:29.430 --> 00:42:29.440 align:start position:0%
my understanding as a developmental
 
00:42:30.870 --> 00:42:30.880 align:start position:0%
psychologist is
 
00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:31.829 align:start position:0%
psychologist is
our

00:42:31.829 --> 00:42:31.839 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:42:34.309 --> 00:42:34.319 align:start position:0%
sex is an objective term it's a term
 
00:42:37.190 --> 00:42:37.200 align:start position:0%
that's defined actually prenatally
 
00:42:39.430 --> 00:42:39.440 align:start position:0%
a few different places first for the 10
 
00:42:41.349 --> 00:42:41.359 align:start position:0%
to 12 week gestational blood work we
 
00:42:43.190 --> 00:42:43.200 align:start position:0%
determine sex and then at 20 weeks
 
00:42:44.790 --> 00:42:44.800 align:start position:0%
gestation there's a sonogram picture
 
00:42:47.190 --> 00:42:47.200 align:start position:0%
that shows the anatomy and some other
 
00:42:49.030 --> 00:42:49.040 align:start position:0%
measurements that
 
00:42:51.510 --> 00:42:51.520 align:start position:0%
refer to sex and then at birth the
 
00:42:51.520 --> 00:42:52.470 align:start position:0%
refer to sex and then at birth the
doctor

00:42:52.470 --> 00:42:52.480 align:start position:0%
doctor
 
00:42:54.710 --> 00:42:54.720 align:start position:0%
or midwife whoever's there
 
00:42:56.309 --> 00:42:56.319 align:start position:0%
confirmed sex based on the observation
 
00:42:58.950 --> 00:42:58.960 align:start position:0%
of genitalia so i just was curious about
 
00:43:00.390 --> 00:43:00.400 align:start position:0%
i want to make sure that i'm
 
00:43:02.150 --> 00:43:02.160 align:start position:0%
understanding the language of the bill
 
00:43:04.790 --> 00:43:04.800 align:start position:0%
referring to sex versus gender
 
00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:05.750 align:start position:0%
referring to sex versus gender
and

00:43:05.750 --> 00:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:06.630 align:start position:0%
and
the

00:43:06.630 --> 00:43:06.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:43:09.190 --> 00:43:09.200 align:start position:0%
the need of the documentation to be more
 
00:43:12.069 --> 00:43:12.079 align:start position:0%
streamlined i want to just make sure i'm
 
00:43:13.829 --> 00:43:13.839 align:start position:0%
speaking to the same thing that you're
 
00:43:13.839 --> 00:43:16.550 align:start position:0%
speaking to the same thing that you're
presenting

00:43:16.550 --> 00:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
presenting
 
00:43:18.470 --> 00:43:18.480 align:start position:0%
i agree with you
 
00:43:19.670 --> 00:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
there's there's
 
00:43:21.910 --> 00:43:21.920 align:start position:0%
we've all we have had that challenge
 
00:43:24.710 --> 00:43:24.720 align:start position:0%
especially within the
 
00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:26.640 align:start position:0%
the transgender community
 
00:43:28.309 --> 00:43:28.319 align:start position:0%
as a whole um
 
00:43:29.910 --> 00:43:29.920 align:start position:0%
in this case
 
00:43:31.270 --> 00:43:31.280 align:start position:0%
we're talking about some legal
 
00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:32.710 align:start position:0%
we're talking about some legal
documentation

00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:32.720 align:start position:0%
documentation
 
00:43:36.069 --> 00:43:36.079 align:start position:0%
and the rsa originally refers to a sex
 
00:43:36.079 --> 00:43:37.030 align:start position:0%
and the rsa originally refers to a sex
change

00:43:37.030 --> 00:43:37.040 align:start position:0%
change
 
00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:38.630 align:start position:0%
change
operation

00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:38.640 align:start position:0%
operation
 
00:43:42.150 --> 00:43:42.160 align:start position:0%
and on the birth certificate it refers
 
00:43:43.990 --> 00:43:44.000 align:start position:0%
to sex
 
00:43:46.150 --> 00:43:46.160 align:start position:0%
on the documentation
 
00:43:49.270 --> 00:43:49.280 align:start position:0%
to change that information
 
00:43:52.230 --> 00:43:52.240 align:start position:0%
on the birth certificate would be
 
00:43:56.150 --> 00:43:56.160 align:start position:0%
extremely difficult and costly
 
00:43:56.160 --> 00:43:56.950 align:start position:0%
extremely difficult and costly
and

00:43:56.950 --> 00:43:56.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:43:59.270 --> 00:43:59.280 align:start position:0%
in the bill that was introduced to
 
00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:00.790 align:start position:0%
in the bill that was introduced to
change

00:44:00.790 --> 00:44:00.800 align:start position:0%
change
 
00:44:03.349 --> 00:44:03.359 align:start position:0%
our driver's licenses
 
00:44:06.069 --> 00:44:06.079 align:start position:0%
the the driver's license refers to the
 
00:44:06.079 --> 00:44:07.190 align:start position:0%
the the driver's license refers to the
gender

00:44:07.190 --> 00:44:07.200 align:start position:0%
gender
 
00:44:10.230 --> 00:44:10.240 align:start position:0%
marker information as sex
 
00:44:12.870 --> 00:44:12.880 align:start position:0%
so from a legal standpoint because of
 
00:44:14.630 --> 00:44:14.640 align:start position:0%
existing records
 
00:44:17.190 --> 00:44:17.200 align:start position:0%
we refer to the change in the document
 
00:44:19.030 --> 00:44:19.040 align:start position:0%
as sex
 
00:44:22.390 --> 00:44:22.400 align:start position:0%
but we in the community identify it as
 
00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:24.309 align:start position:0%
but we in the community identify it as
gender

00:44:24.309 --> 00:44:24.319 align:start position:0%
gender
 
00:44:27.430 --> 00:44:27.440 align:start position:0%
so for some folks it's interchangeable
 
00:44:30.069 --> 00:44:30.079 align:start position:0%
especially here in concord it's been
 
00:44:32.390 --> 00:44:32.400 align:start position:0%
recognized that the ultimately the
 
00:44:35.430 --> 00:44:35.440 align:start position:0%
documents that we're working with
 
00:44:38.870 --> 00:44:38.880 align:start position:0%
it's listed as sex so as such
 
00:44:41.670 --> 00:44:41.680 align:start position:0%
that's the field that's the information
 
00:44:45.030 --> 00:44:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:48.150 --> 00:44:48.160 align:start position:0%
dr silver you may continue
 
00:44:50.630 --> 00:44:50.640 align:start position:0%
yeah so um i just was
 
00:44:52.309 --> 00:44:52.319 align:start position:0%
looking through the rest of the bill and
 
00:44:54.069 --> 00:44:54.079 align:start position:0%
there's a
 
00:44:55.829 --> 00:44:55.839 align:start position:0%
the determination that under my
 
00:44:57.829 --> 00:44:57.839 align:start position:0%
professional opinion that i could
 
00:45:00.870 --> 00:45:00.880 align:start position:0%
say what gender is and to fill out the
 
00:45:03.829 --> 00:45:03.839 align:start position:0%
form to allow the person to change their
 
00:45:05.829 --> 00:45:05.839 align:start position:0%
birth certificate and i just was a
 
00:45:07.030 --> 00:45:07.040 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
00:45:08.630 --> 00:45:08.640 align:start position:0%
thrown off by that because i was a
 
00:45:10.870 --> 00:45:10.880 align:start position:0%
little bit concerned um thinking about
 
00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:11.829 align:start position:0%
little bit concerned um thinking about
this

00:45:11.829 --> 00:45:11.839 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:45:13.910 --> 00:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
fluidity and thinking about the terms
 
00:45:15.750 --> 00:45:15.760 align:start position:0%
gender and sex
 
00:45:18.470 --> 00:45:18.480 align:start position:0%
for me how i observe somebody's
 
00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:19.430 align:start position:0%
for me how i observe somebody's
gender

00:45:19.430 --> 00:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
gender
 
00:45:22.150 --> 00:45:22.160 align:start position:0%
might be different from the way they
 
00:45:25.510 --> 00:45:25.520 align:start position:0%
experience their gender and so i'm just
 
00:45:27.190 --> 00:45:27.200 align:start position:0%
concerned a little bit about taking the
 
00:45:30.550 --> 00:45:30.560 align:start position:0%
objectivity in the way that we have on
 
00:45:32.870 --> 00:45:32.880 align:start position:0%
previous documents to refer to
 
00:45:35.910 --> 00:45:35.920 align:start position:0%
sex as an objective something that
 
00:45:38.950 --> 00:45:38.960 align:start position:0%
somebody else tells us right so
 
00:45:40.470 --> 00:45:40.480 align:start position:0%
absence or
 
00:45:43.109 --> 00:45:43.119 align:start position:0%
not of certain genitalia or
 
00:45:46.150 --> 00:45:46.160 align:start position:0%
x x or x y chromosomes
 
00:45:47.990 --> 00:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
so then for me
 
00:45:50.870 --> 00:45:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:55.190 --> 00:45:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:57.430 --> 00:45:57.440 align:start position:0%
undermine the client
 
00:45:59.670 --> 00:45:59.680 align:start position:0%
psychologist relationship if i were to
 
00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:01.270 align:start position:0%
psychologist relationship if i were to
say

00:46:01.270 --> 00:46:01.280 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:46:03.030 --> 00:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
that the gender the person's presenting
 
00:46:04.950 --> 00:46:04.960 align:start position:0%
as maybe um
 
00:46:06.870 --> 00:46:06.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem as
 
00:46:09.190 --> 00:46:09.200 align:start position:0%
subjective to me so for example i
 
00:46:11.510 --> 00:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
observe somebody is maybe a tomboy right
 
00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
so somebody's presenting that is
 
00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:15.109 align:start position:0%
so somebody's presenting that is
biologically

00:46:15.109 --> 00:46:15.119 align:start position:0%
biologically
 
00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
female but presenting as
 
00:46:19.510 --> 00:46:19.520 align:start position:0%
wanting to have a masculine gender
 
00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:21.109 align:start position:0%
wanting to have a masculine gender
identity

00:46:21.109 --> 00:46:21.119 align:start position:0%
identity
 
00:46:22.710 --> 00:46:22.720 align:start position:0%
so i'm just
 
00:46:25.109 --> 00:46:25.119 align:start position:0%
concerned a little bit about
 
00:46:27.430 --> 00:46:27.440 align:start position:0%
i would never want to invalidate my
 
00:46:29.430 --> 00:46:29.440 align:start position:0%
client for them to feel like i don't
 
00:46:31.510 --> 00:46:31.520 align:start position:0%
understand them or respect where they're
 
00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:32.309 align:start position:0%
understand them or respect where they're
at

00:46:32.309 --> 00:46:32.319 align:start position:0%
at
 
00:46:35.990 --> 00:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
and so i could see feeling pressure to
 
00:46:38.069 --> 00:46:38.079 align:start position:0%
kind of sign off on the paperwork on
 
00:46:40.829 --> 00:46:40.839 align:start position:0%
changing their gender because of
 
00:46:42.950 --> 00:46:42.960 align:start position:0%
their expression
 
00:46:46.069 --> 00:46:46.079 align:start position:0%
in a way that might not be authentic to
 
00:46:46.079 --> 00:46:47.190 align:start position:0%
in a way that might not be authentic to
our

00:46:47.190 --> 00:46:47.200 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:46:49.750 --> 00:46:49.760 align:start position:0%
our roles together is um
 
00:46:52.309 --> 00:46:52.319 align:start position:0%
discussing the ways that they express
 
00:46:53.910 --> 00:46:53.920 align:start position:0%
their gender discussing the ways that
 
00:46:55.829 --> 00:46:55.839 align:start position:0%
they are able to
 
00:46:57.430 --> 00:46:57.440 align:start position:0%
do that
 
00:46:58.710 --> 00:46:58.720 align:start position:0%
so i just
 
00:47:01.430 --> 00:47:01.440 align:start position:0%
was a little bit concerned about the
 
00:47:03.030 --> 00:47:03.040 align:start position:0%
possible effects of a therapy of
 
00:47:04.790 --> 00:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
relationship if
 
00:47:09.190 --> 00:47:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:11.109 --> 00:47:11.119 align:start position:0%
is it's become it becomes subjective
 
00:47:13.109 --> 00:47:13.119 align:start position:0%
instead of objective so
 
00:47:15.109 --> 00:47:15.119 align:start position:0%
thinking about sex and gender in that
 
00:47:17.030 --> 00:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
way so if sex is
 
00:47:20.470 --> 00:47:20.480 align:start position:0%
observable and gender is fluid and not
 
00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:21.510 align:start position:0%
observable and gender is fluid and not
clear

00:47:21.510 --> 00:47:21.520 align:start position:0%
clear
 
00:47:23.829 --> 00:47:23.839 align:start position:0%
um what that might look like in terms of
 
00:47:25.670 --> 00:47:25.680 align:start position:0%
the relationship between the client and
 
00:47:27.349 --> 00:47:27.359 align:start position:0%
the psychologist
 
00:47:30.390 --> 00:47:30.400 align:start position:0%
and the implications for that
 
00:47:32.710 --> 00:47:32.720 align:start position:0%
does anyone have any questions for dr
 
00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:39.670 align:start position:0%
does anyone have any questions for dr
silvera

00:47:39.670 --> 00:47:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:41.270 --> 00:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
i see two hands up i don't know if
 
00:47:46.080 --> 00:47:46.090 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:46.090 --> 00:47:49.349 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:47:49.349 --> 00:47:49.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:51.430 --> 00:47:51.440 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
 
00:47:51.440 --> 00:47:54.870 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
kobalt

00:47:54.870 --> 00:47:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:57.430 --> 00:47:57.440 align:start position:0%
thank you um thank you mr chairman uh
 
00:48:00.950 --> 00:48:00.960 align:start position:0%
representative cannon i i wanted to just
 
00:48:03.750 --> 00:48:03.760 align:start position:0%
be clear about the marginal note called
 
00:48:05.270 --> 00:48:05.280 align:start position:0%
for in this bill
 
00:48:07.109 --> 00:48:07.119 align:start position:0%
the language of the bill does say that
 
00:48:09.670 --> 00:48:09.680 align:start position:0%
the marginal note will
 
00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:10.870 align:start position:0%
the marginal note will
indicate

00:48:10.870 --> 00:48:10.880 align:start position:0%
indicate
 
00:48:12.150 --> 00:48:12.160 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
00:48:14.150 --> 00:48:14.160 align:start position:0%
that the change was that the record has
 
00:48:15.990 --> 00:48:16.000 align:start position:0%
been amended in accordance with this
 
00:48:18.390 --> 00:48:18.400 align:start position:0%
paragraph so
 
00:48:20.870 --> 00:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
my understanding there is that the the
 
00:48:23.910 --> 00:48:23.920 align:start position:0%
reason for the change is therefore
 
00:48:27.990 --> 00:48:28.000 align:start position:0%
noted on the amended certificate is that
 
00:48:30.390 --> 00:48:30.400 align:start position:0%
is that understanding correct
 
00:48:32.309 --> 00:48:32.319 align:start position:0%
i'd have to go back to the vital records
 
00:48:35.109 --> 00:48:35.119 align:start position:0%
office to see how they make the note on
 
00:48:35.119 --> 00:48:36.549 align:start position:0%
office to see how they make the note on
other

00:48:36.549 --> 00:48:36.559 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:48:38.390 --> 00:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
birth record changes whether they
 
00:48:42.470 --> 00:48:42.480 align:start position:0%
include the reason or not it's it's it's
 
00:48:45.030 --> 00:48:45.040 align:start position:0%
really up to their policy right now i
 
00:48:47.270 --> 00:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
was told by the vital records office
 
00:48:49.910 --> 00:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
that it would have a pointer to the
 
00:48:53.109 --> 00:48:53.119 align:start position:0%
specific document the original document
 
00:48:53.119 --> 00:48:54.870 align:start position:0%
specific document the original document
um

00:48:54.870 --> 00:48:54.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:59.510 --> 00:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:03.030 --> 00:49:03.040 align:start position:0%

yeah thank you
uh

00:49:48.790 --> 00:49:48.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:49:51.750 --> 00:49:51.760 align:start position:0%
representative cannon i just wondered
 
00:49:53.430 --> 00:49:53.440 align:start position:0%
it came as a surprise to me today when
 
00:49:54.710 --> 00:49:54.720 align:start position:0%
you testified
 
00:49:56.230 --> 00:49:56.240 align:start position:0%
that some of the
 
00:49:57.349 --> 00:49:57.359 align:start position:0%
some of the
 
00:49:57.359 --> 00:49:58.950 align:start position:0%
some of the
documentation

00:49:58.950 --> 00:49:58.960 align:start position:0%
documentation
 
00:50:01.270 --> 00:50:01.280 align:start position:0%
has a marginal note that says this is a
 
00:50:04.230 --> 00:50:04.240 align:start position:0%
change however you also said that if the
 
00:50:06.790 --> 00:50:06.800 align:start position:0%
person appears before the judge and said
 
00:50:09.030 --> 00:50:09.040 align:start position:0%
they do not want a marginal note if the
 
00:50:11.109 --> 00:50:11.119 align:start position:0%
marginal note doesn't exist
 
00:50:12.710 --> 00:50:12.720 align:start position:0%
so does that mean that some of these
 
00:50:14.390 --> 00:50:14.400 align:start position:0%
people have a marginal note and some of
 
00:50:15.990 --> 00:50:16.000 align:start position:0%
the people don't
 
00:50:18.309 --> 00:50:18.319 align:start position:0%
and thinking about some of the comments
 
00:50:21.670 --> 00:50:21.680 align:start position:0%
that we got on email from the public
 
00:50:23.750 --> 00:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
a lot of people's concern really was
 
00:50:25.589 --> 00:50:25.599 align:start position:0%
that there needs to be some note about
 
00:50:28.710 --> 00:50:28.720 align:start position:0%
what the original birth certificate said
 
00:50:31.190 --> 00:50:31.200 align:start position:0%
and if the marginal notes removed
 
00:50:33.430 --> 00:50:33.440 align:start position:0%
i'm just wondering if if that question
 
00:50:35.109 --> 00:50:35.119 align:start position:0%
has ever been asked and is there a
 
00:50:37.430 --> 00:50:37.440 align:start position:0%
solution to that if some people's
 
00:50:37.440 --> 00:50:38.470 align:start position:0%
solution to that if some people's
records

00:50:38.470 --> 00:50:38.480 align:start position:0%
records
 
00:50:41.829 --> 00:50:41.839 align:start position:0%
show that the the change was made and uh
 
00:50:43.430 --> 00:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
by putting the marginal note in it and
 
00:50:47.349 --> 00:50:47.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:48.549 --> 00:50:48.559 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
00:50:50.549 --> 00:50:50.559 align:start position:0%
representative snow
 
00:50:52.150 --> 00:50:52.160 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:53.190 align:start position:0%
the um
if

00:50:53.190 --> 00:50:53.200 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:50:56.630 --> 00:50:56.640 align:start position:0%
a court issues an order to change the
 
00:50:56.640 --> 00:50:57.670 align:start position:0%
a court issues an order to change the
birth

00:50:57.670 --> 00:50:57.680 align:start position:0%
birth
 
00:50:57.680 --> 00:50:58.950 align:start position:0%
birth
certificate

00:50:58.950 --> 00:50:58.960 align:start position:0%
certificate
 
00:51:02.150 --> 00:51:02.160 align:start position:0%
there is no marginal note
 
00:51:04.069 --> 00:51:04.079 align:start position:0%
and in fact a
 
00:51:07.349 --> 00:51:07.359 align:start position:0%
that's essentially for the past 15 years
 
00:51:10.230 --> 00:51:10.240 align:start position:0%
any court ordered
 
00:51:12.390 --> 00:51:12.400 align:start position:0%
birth certificate change
 
00:51:15.990 --> 00:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
does not have a marginal note
 
00:51:17.190 --> 00:51:17.200 align:start position:0%
a person
 
00:51:20.710 --> 00:51:20.720 align:start position:0%
after after this bill were to be passed
 
00:51:22.950 --> 00:51:22.960 align:start position:0%
once they go to the clerk's office and
 
00:51:25.030 --> 00:51:25.040 align:start position:0%
the forms are processed and sent to the
 
00:51:27.750 --> 00:51:27.760 align:start position:0%
vital records office a marginal note
 
00:51:30.470 --> 00:51:30.480 align:start position:0%
will be added to a birth record based on
 
00:51:31.829 --> 00:51:31.839 align:start position:0%
this procedure
 
00:51:31.839 --> 00:51:33.270 align:start position:0%
this procedure
if

00:51:33.270 --> 00:51:33.280 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:51:33.280 --> 00:51:34.390 align:start position:0%
if
a

00:51:34.390 --> 00:51:34.400 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:51:36.309 --> 00:51:36.319 align:start position:0%
gen a
 
00:51:38.549 --> 00:51:38.559 align:start position:0%
has been changed and the individual goes
 
00:51:41.349 --> 00:51:41.359 align:start position:0%
to the court and gets a court order
 
00:51:43.589 --> 00:51:43.599 align:start position:0%
to change their birth record
 
00:51:45.670 --> 00:51:45.680 align:start position:0%
that won't have
 
00:51:49.430 --> 00:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:52.069 --> 00:51:52.079 align:start position:0%
which in that case for many of the of
 
00:51:54.790 --> 00:51:54.800 align:start position:0%
the community of people that would have
 
00:51:57.109 --> 00:51:57.119 align:start position:0%
a need to change their records
 
00:51:59.349 --> 00:51:59.359 align:start position:0%
that is important to them is to not have
 
00:52:00.870 --> 00:52:00.880 align:start position:0%
a marginal note on their birth
 
00:52:03.109 --> 00:52:03.119 align:start position:0%
certificate and they can do so if they
 
00:52:06.950 --> 00:52:06.960 align:start position:0%
go to a judge and get that order
 
00:52:10.069 --> 00:52:10.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:13.030 --> 00:52:13.040 align:start position:0%
this does not change the from how things
 
00:52:16.309 --> 00:52:16.319 align:start position:0%
are processed from the original rsa the
 
00:52:16.319 --> 00:52:17.030 align:start position:0%
are processed from the original rsa the
the

00:52:17.030 --> 00:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:52:18.710 --> 00:52:18.720 align:start position:0%
changes that we
 
00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:19.589 align:start position:0%
changes that we
are

00:52:19.589 --> 00:52:19.599 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:52:21.430 --> 00:52:21.440 align:start position:0%
we've been proposing here
 
00:52:21.440 --> 00:52:22.309 align:start position:0%
we've been proposing here
would

00:52:22.309 --> 00:52:22.319 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:52:24.710 --> 00:52:24.720 align:start position:0%
still require a marginal note
 
00:52:30.230 --> 00:52:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:30.240 --> 00:52:31.430 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

00:52:31.430 --> 00:52:31.440 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:52:33.030 --> 00:52:33.040 align:start position:0%
and let's follow up
 
00:52:35.589 --> 00:52:35.599 align:start position:0%
you and as far as you can tell nothing
 
00:52:36.630 --> 00:52:36.640 align:start position:0%
you've heard
 
00:52:37.910 --> 00:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
makes the fact that this will be
 
00:52:39.430 --> 00:52:39.440 align:start position:0%
somewhat inconsistent whether the
 
00:52:41.510 --> 00:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
marginal note or not is not really an
 
00:52:45.030 --> 00:52:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:47.030 --> 00:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
it won't be essentially it wouldn't be a
 
00:52:50.230 --> 00:52:50.240 align:start position:0%

community

00:52:52.069 --> 00:52:52.079 align:start position:0%
community
 
00:52:53.670 --> 00:52:53.680 align:start position:0%
has already flagged that they don't they
 
00:52:55.829 --> 00:52:55.839 align:start position:0%
think that would be a problem for them
 
00:52:57.670 --> 00:52:57.680 align:start position:0%
but we have already made them aware they
 
00:53:00.390 --> 00:53:00.400 align:start position:0%
can go to the court talk with the judge
 
00:53:02.470 --> 00:53:02.480 align:start position:0%
he can issue the order and they can get
 
00:53:04.150 --> 00:53:04.160 align:start position:0%
a birth certificate without a marginal
 
00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:07.829 align:start position:0%

hello okay can you hear me thank you
 
00:53:44.630 --> 00:53:44.640 align:start position:0%
hi thank you chairperson thank you
 
00:53:45.829 --> 00:53:45.839 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is
 
00:53:48.630 --> 00:53:48.640 align:start position:0%
chris urchill i'm an attorney with glbtq
 
00:53:50.390 --> 00:53:50.400 align:start position:0%

00:53:51.829 --> 00:53:51.839 align:start position:0%

00:53:58.710 --> 00:53:58.720 align:start position:0%
um and i'm also a new hampshire licensed
 
00:54:00.790 --> 00:54:00.800 align:start position:0%
attorney um
 
00:54:03.270 --> 00:54:03.280 align:start position:0%
i think this bill is a no-brainer and i
 
00:54:04.710 --> 00:54:04.720 align:start position:0%
can tell you why
 
00:54:07.510 --> 00:54:07.520 align:start position:0%
um the bill only changes the process for
 
00:54:09.910 --> 00:54:09.920 align:start position:0%
how transgender people update the gender
 
00:54:11.270 --> 00:54:11.280 align:start position:0%
marker on their birth records and
 
00:54:14.470 --> 00:54:14.480 align:start position:0%
there's no change at all to the standard
 
00:54:17.430 --> 00:54:17.440 align:start position:0%
um today courts are using their valuable
 
00:54:20.150 --> 00:54:20.160 align:start position:0%
limited resources to hold hearings and
 
00:54:22.630 --> 00:54:22.640 align:start position:0%
to issue orders on gender markers this
 
00:54:25.030 --> 00:54:25.040 align:start position:0%
is largely unnecessary
 
00:54:27.750 --> 00:54:27.760 align:start position:0%
in other words it's pointless red tape
 
00:54:29.829 --> 00:54:29.839 align:start position:0%
there's no reason that a judge needs to
 
00:54:32.230 --> 00:54:32.240 align:start position:0%
issue an order about a person's gender
 
00:54:34.549 --> 00:54:34.559 align:start position:0%
in fact judges in new hampshire today
 
00:54:36.790 --> 00:54:36.800 align:start position:0%
defer to medical professionals to tell
 
00:54:38.390 --> 00:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
them whether a person has transitioned
 
00:54:40.230 --> 00:54:40.240 align:start position:0%
from one gender to another
 
00:54:43.430 --> 00:54:43.440 align:start position:0%
um you might hear that judges apply
 
00:54:45.670 --> 00:54:45.680 align:start position:0%
different standards inconsistently
 
00:54:47.670 --> 00:54:47.680 align:start position:0%
so it's possible under the status quo
 
00:54:49.670 --> 00:54:49.680 align:start position:0%
that different judges would evaluate the
 
00:54:51.109 --> 00:54:51.119 align:start position:0%
meaning of gender transition in
 
00:54:52.870 --> 00:54:52.880 align:start position:0%
different ways but it's pretty much
 
00:54:54.870 --> 00:54:54.880 align:start position:0%
universal at this point at least to my
 
00:54:56.549 --> 00:54:56.559 align:start position:0%
personal knowledge and experience that
 
00:54:59.349 --> 00:54:59.359 align:start position:0%
judges simply listen to the doctors
 
00:55:00.630 --> 00:55:00.640 align:start position:0%
which makes sense the major
 
00:55:02.549 --> 00:55:02.559 align:start position:0%
inconsistency that we see is that some
 
00:55:04.230 --> 00:55:04.240 align:start position:0%
judges want to hear directly from
 
00:55:06.309 --> 00:55:06.319 align:start position:0%
doctors in the form of testimony while
 
00:55:08.390 --> 00:55:08.400 align:start position:0%
others accept medical records and notes
 
00:55:09.750 --> 00:55:09.760 align:start position:0%
as sufficient evidence of gender
 
00:55:12.710 --> 00:55:12.720 align:start position:0%
transition so that inconsistency it's
 
00:55:15.910 --> 00:55:15.920 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily confusing and cumbersome
 
00:55:19.270 --> 00:55:19.280 align:start position:0%
so hb 295 sets a single standard and
 
00:55:21.030 --> 00:55:21.040 align:start position:0%
rather than putting judges in the middle
 
00:55:22.790 --> 00:55:22.800 align:start position:0%
of the conversation the bill puts the
 
00:55:24.950 --> 00:55:24.960 align:start position:0%
medical professionals on record
 
00:55:26.950 --> 00:55:26.960 align:start position:0%
attesting to the person's gender
 
00:55:26.960 --> 00:55:28.150 align:start position:0%
attesting to the person's gender
transition

00:55:28.150 --> 00:55:28.160 align:start position:0%
transition
 
00:55:30.790 --> 00:55:30.800 align:start position:0%
and so um i want to point out that under
 
00:55:33.510 --> 00:55:33.520 align:start position:0%
rsa 5-c 14
 
00:55:35.910 --> 00:55:35.920 align:start position:0%
a person would be guilty of a felony for
 
00:55:38.230 --> 00:55:38.240 align:start position:0%
falsifying such a statement
 
00:55:40.790 --> 00:55:40.800 align:start position:0%
um so so there's a there's a strong
 
00:55:43.030 --> 00:55:43.040 align:start position:0%
safeguard and in fact that kind of the
 
00:55:44.790 --> 00:55:44.800 align:start position:0%
question came up about notarization
 
00:55:47.430 --> 00:55:47.440 align:start position:0%
being a barrier there's already a
 
00:55:49.270 --> 00:55:49.280 align:start position:0%
safeguard for fraud
 
00:55:51.670 --> 00:55:51.680 align:start position:0%
which is that a medical professional's
 
00:55:54.309 --> 00:55:54.319 align:start position:0%
um falsification of a record would be a
 
00:55:55.910 --> 00:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
felony okay
 
00:55:57.910 --> 00:55:57.920 align:start position:0%
for a little bit of extra historical
 
00:55:59.670 --> 00:55:59.680 align:start position:0%
context in addition to whatever what
 
00:56:00.950 --> 00:56:00.960 align:start position:0%
you've already heard i just want to
 
00:56:03.510 --> 00:56:03.520 align:start position:0%
explain we used to understand that
 
00:56:06.390 --> 00:56:06.400 align:start position:0%
treatment for gender dysphoria we used
 
00:56:08.390 --> 00:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
to understand it differently um so
 
00:56:10.390 --> 00:56:10.400 align:start position:0%
gender dysphoria is a medical condition
 
00:56:11.990 --> 00:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
that's characterized by clinical
 
00:56:15.190 --> 00:56:15.200 align:start position:0%
distress due to the incongruence between
 
00:56:17.190 --> 00:56:17.200 align:start position:0%
a person's assigned sex on one hand and
 
00:56:19.589 --> 00:56:19.599 align:start position:0%
their gender identity on the other hand
 
00:56:21.349 --> 00:56:21.359 align:start position:0%
gender dysphoria is a serious medical
 
00:56:23.670 --> 00:56:23.680 align:start position:0%
condition but it's highly treatable
 
00:56:25.990 --> 00:56:26.000 align:start position:0%
and stated really simply treatment for
 
00:56:28.870 --> 00:56:28.880 align:start position:0%
gender dysphoria is gender transition so
 
00:56:30.950 --> 00:56:30.960 align:start position:0%
it used to be that a person's gender
 
00:56:33.750 --> 00:56:33.760 align:start position:0%
transition was understood commonly by
 
00:56:35.510 --> 00:56:35.520 align:start position:0%
one or more surgeries
 
00:56:36.950 --> 00:56:36.960 align:start position:0%
now we understand that treatment for
 
00:56:38.829 --> 00:56:38.839 align:start position:0%
gender dysphoria is much more
 
00:56:41.190 --> 00:56:41.200 align:start position:0%
individualized and that what is
 
00:56:43.430 --> 00:56:43.440 align:start position:0%
appropriate treatment for one person
 
00:56:44.950 --> 00:56:44.960 align:start position:0%
might not be appropriate for another
 
00:56:44.960 --> 00:56:45.910 align:start position:0%
might not be appropriate for another
person

00:56:45.910 --> 00:56:45.920 align:start position:0%
person
 
00:56:47.910 --> 00:56:47.920 align:start position:0%
treatment for gender dysphoria usually
 
00:56:49.750 --> 00:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
involves some combination of social
 
00:56:49.760 --> 00:56:51.109 align:start position:0%
involves some combination of social
transition

00:56:51.109 --> 00:56:51.119 align:start position:0%
transition
 
00:56:52.549 --> 00:56:52.559 align:start position:0%
so social transition is one thing
 
00:56:54.789 --> 00:56:54.799 align:start position:0%
hormone therapy and sometimes one or
 
00:56:57.270 --> 00:56:57.280 align:start position:0%
more surgeries but different people have
 
00:56:58.870 --> 00:56:58.880 align:start position:0%
different needs and i want to point out
 
00:57:01.589 --> 00:57:01.599 align:start position:0%
that one element of social transition
 
00:57:03.670 --> 00:57:03.680 align:start position:0%
might be updating identification
 
00:57:05.990 --> 00:57:06.000 align:start position:0%
documents like birth records so in that
 
00:57:07.670 --> 00:57:07.680 align:start position:0%
sense correcting the gender marker on
 
00:57:09.670 --> 00:57:09.680 align:start position:0%
your birth certificate can be part of
 
00:57:11.430 --> 00:57:11.440 align:start position:0%
your medical treatment
 
00:57:14.309 --> 00:57:14.319 align:start position:0%
so we do not want to incentivize surgery
 
00:57:15.910 --> 00:57:15.920 align:start position:0%
for people who don't need surgery
 
00:57:17.589 --> 00:57:17.599 align:start position:0%
especially young people
 
00:57:19.349 --> 00:57:19.359 align:start position:0%
so that's why there's no surgical
 
00:57:21.430 --> 00:57:21.440 align:start position:0%
requirement today instead the question
 
00:57:23.190 --> 00:57:23.200 align:start position:0%
is whether a person has had appropriate
 
00:57:24.870 --> 00:57:24.880 align:start position:0%
medical treatment and that's the
 
00:57:26.390 --> 00:57:26.400 align:start position:0%
standard that judges use in new
 
00:57:28.390 --> 00:57:28.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire today and that's the standard
 
00:57:31.670 --> 00:57:31.680 align:start position:0%
that will apply if hb 295 passes
 
00:57:33.109 --> 00:57:33.119 align:start position:0%
um so leaving it to medical
 
00:57:34.870 --> 00:57:34.880 align:start position:0%
professionals to attest to whether a
 
00:57:36.630 --> 00:57:36.640 align:start position:0%
person's gender is different from what
 
00:57:37.990 --> 00:57:38.000 align:start position:0%
appears on the birth certificate that's
 
00:57:40.470 --> 00:57:40.480 align:start position:0%
what makes the most sense uh this bill
 
00:57:42.950 --> 00:57:42.960 align:start position:0%
safeguards against abuse by making it a
 
00:57:44.789 --> 00:57:44.799 align:start position:0%
felony to include false information on
 
00:57:46.549 --> 00:57:46.559 align:start position:0%
the application i want to point out that
 
00:57:48.069 --> 00:57:48.079 align:start position:0%
in subpart b
 
00:57:50.870 --> 00:57:50.880 align:start position:0%
of the um of the bill there is a
 
00:57:54.470 --> 00:57:54.480 align:start position:0%
reference to an application that um
 
00:57:56.470 --> 00:57:56.480 align:start position:0%
that reference is enough to justify the
 
00:57:58.870 --> 00:57:58.880 align:start position:0%
creation of a form uh but i would not be
 
00:58:01.910 --> 00:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
opposed personally to um to an amendment
 
00:58:04.710 --> 00:58:04.720 align:start position:0%
that makes that uh more directive but
 
00:58:07.670 --> 00:58:07.680 align:start position:0%
the application is referenced in part b
 
00:58:07.680 --> 00:58:08.710 align:start position:0%
the application is referenced in part b
um

00:58:08.710 --> 00:58:08.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:08.720 --> 00:58:09.589 align:start position:0%
um
and

00:58:09.589 --> 00:58:09.599 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:58:09.599 --> 00:58:10.870 align:start position:0%
and
um

00:58:10.870 --> 00:58:10.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:13.109 --> 00:58:13.119 align:start position:0%
yeah i i am really proud to be
 
00:58:15.190 --> 00:58:15.200 align:start position:0%

i'll read them all at once so you can
 
00:59:29.200 --> 00:59:30.230 align:start position:0%
i'll read them all at once so you can
decide

00:59:30.230 --> 00:59:30.240 align:start position:0%
decide
 
00:59:30.240 --> 00:59:31.109 align:start position:0%
decide
um

00:59:31.109 --> 00:59:31.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:33.270 --> 00:59:33.280 align:start position:0%
the sex and gender
 
00:59:36.069 --> 00:59:36.079 align:start position:0%
terminology should that be just used
 
00:59:36.079 --> 00:59:37.190 align:start position:0%
terminology should that be just used
together

00:59:37.190 --> 00:59:37.200 align:start position:0%
together
 
00:59:39.829 --> 00:59:39.839 align:start position:0%
sex slash gender because throughout this
 
00:59:39.839 --> 00:59:40.789 align:start position:0%
sex slash gender because throughout this
bill

00:59:40.789 --> 00:59:40.799 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:59:43.670 --> 00:59:43.680 align:start position:0%
i'm not asking you for the legality of
 
00:59:46.789 --> 00:59:46.799 align:start position:0%
the bill but for the meaning of the way
 
00:59:50.470 --> 00:59:50.480 align:start position:0%
it's used in your opinion would that be
 
00:59:52.309 --> 00:59:52.319 align:start position:0%
cover all bases
 
00:59:55.829 --> 00:59:55.839 align:start position:0%
so sex slash gender
 
00:59:58.829 --> 00:59:58.839 align:start position:0%
then do any other states
 
01:00:01.670 --> 01:00:01.680 align:start position:0%
allow to make copies of the birth
 
01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:02.950 align:start position:0%
allow to make copies of the birth
certificate

01:00:02.950 --> 01:00:02.960 align:start position:0%
certificate
 
01:00:05.270 --> 01:00:05.280 align:start position:0%
that doesn't have a marginal note for
 
01:00:07.990 --> 01:00:08.000 align:start position:0%
the people when they request copy but it
 
01:00:10.710 --> 01:00:10.720 align:start position:0%
puts it on the original
 
01:00:12.870 --> 01:00:12.880 align:start position:0%
so there's a record that there are two
 
01:00:14.470 --> 01:00:14.480 align:start position:0%
birth tickets
 
01:00:15.349 --> 01:00:15.359 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:00:15.359 --> 01:00:16.150 align:start position:0%
and then
i

01:00:16.150 --> 01:00:16.160 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:00:18.470 --> 01:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
this probably isn't your question but i
 
01:00:21.910 --> 01:00:21.920 align:start position:0%
need to know who makes the form
 
01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:23.030 align:start position:0%
need to know who makes the form
here

01:00:23.030 --> 01:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:00:25.750 --> 01:00:25.760 align:start position:0%
the form that's been prescribed
 
01:00:28.870 --> 01:00:28.880 align:start position:0%
who's supposed to make it so those are
 
01:00:31.670 --> 01:00:31.680 align:start position:0%
my three questions
 
01:00:33.589 --> 01:00:33.599 align:start position:0%
um so i'll start with the third question
 
01:00:35.190 --> 01:00:35.200 align:start position:0%
and work backwards i don't know the
 
01:00:37.349 --> 01:00:37.359 align:start position:0%
answer to the third question and that's
 
01:00:39.510 --> 01:00:39.520 align:start position:0%
uh so hopefully somebody else can answer
 
01:00:42.390 --> 01:00:42.400 align:start position:0%
that for you um as to the second
 
01:00:44.470 --> 01:00:44.480 align:start position:0%
question about whether other states
 
01:00:46.230 --> 01:00:46.240 align:start position:0%
allow you to obtain if i understand
 
01:00:49.349 --> 01:00:49.359 align:start position:0%
correctly you are asking if uh if a
 
01:00:52.230 --> 01:00:52.240 align:start position:0%
birth certificate has a marginal note
 
01:00:54.950 --> 01:00:54.960 align:start position:0%
but on the original but a copy can be
 
01:00:57.589 --> 01:00:57.599 align:start position:0%
obtained without the marginal note
 
01:00:59.190 --> 01:00:59.200 align:start position:0%
and i believe that there are other
 
01:01:00.789 --> 01:01:00.799 align:start position:0%
states but i would have to check to
 
01:01:02.309 --> 01:01:02.319 align:start position:0%
confirm that and if you'd like me to i
 
01:01:04.630 --> 01:01:04.640 align:start position:0%
can do some research and get back to the
 
01:01:06.390 --> 01:01:06.400 align:start position:0%
committee with that information about
 
01:01:08.950 --> 01:01:08.960 align:start position:0%
whether other states do that um
 
01:01:11.589 --> 01:01:11.599 align:start position:0%
uh so so is that is that something you
 
01:01:13.270 --> 01:01:13.280 align:start position:0%
would like me to do
 
01:01:14.710 --> 01:01:14.720 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
01:01:17.270 --> 01:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
okay and then to the first question
 
01:01:19.829 --> 01:01:19.839 align:start position:0%
about the use of the terms sex and
 
01:01:21.910 --> 01:01:21.920 align:start position:0%
gender i just want to say in my legal
 
01:01:25.510 --> 01:01:25.520 align:start position:0%
opinion there is no uh definitional
 
01:01:27.750 --> 01:01:27.760 align:start position:0%
difference between the terms sex and
 
01:01:30.870 --> 01:01:30.880 align:start position:0%
gender from a legal perspective and um
 
01:01:32.950 --> 01:01:32.960 align:start position:0%
i'm not qualified to speak to whether
 
01:01:34.470 --> 01:01:34.480 align:start position:0%
those terms have
 
01:01:37.430 --> 01:01:37.440 align:start position:0%
any meaning outside of the legal context
 
01:01:40.549 --> 01:01:40.559 align:start position:0%
independent but i do um i do know that
 
01:01:42.710 --> 01:01:42.720 align:start position:0%
doctors in new hampshire and judges in
 
01:01:44.549 --> 01:01:44.559 align:start position:0%
new hampshire have been relying on the
 
01:01:48.390 --> 01:01:48.400 align:start position:0%
term sex change uh to to you know that's
 
01:01:51.109 --> 01:01:51.119 align:start position:0%
the that's the that's the um current
 
01:01:54.470 --> 01:01:54.480 align:start position:0%
legal uh term that's in the statute and
 
01:01:57.190 --> 01:01:57.200 align:start position:0%
um and and that's
 
01:01:59.589 --> 01:01:59.599 align:start position:0%
a person's gender transition has been
 
01:02:02.069 --> 01:02:02.079 align:start position:0%
sufficient to meet that standard so i
 
01:02:03.670 --> 01:02:03.680 align:start position:0%
think legally there's no difference
 
01:02:06.069 --> 01:02:06.079 align:start position:0%
between the word sex and gender and so
 
01:02:07.910 --> 01:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
for the purposes of this bill it just
 
01:02:10.069 --> 01:02:10.079 align:start position:0%
it's it's insignificant and so yes if it
 
01:02:13.030 --> 01:02:13.040 align:start position:0%
were sex slash gender sex and or gender
 
01:02:14.710 --> 01:02:14.720 align:start position:0%
or just using the terms interchangeably
 
01:02:16.150 --> 01:02:16.160 align:start position:0%
i think they would all have the same
 
01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:17.109 align:start position:0%
i think they would all have the same
outcome

01:02:17.109 --> 01:02:17.119 align:start position:0%
outcome
 
01:02:19.670 --> 01:02:19.680 align:start position:0%
legally speaking
 
01:02:22.069 --> 01:02:22.079 align:start position:0%
council just for your information before
 
01:02:24.630 --> 01:02:24.640 align:start position:0%
you um start the research
 
01:02:27.270 --> 01:02:27.280 align:start position:0%
uh i had hoped we would get everything
 
01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:28.069 align:start position:0%
uh i had hoped we would get everything
done

01:02:28.069 --> 01:02:28.079 align:start position:0%
done
 
01:02:30.549 --> 01:02:30.559 align:start position:0%
today and next monday
 
01:02:32.789 --> 01:02:32.799 align:start position:0%
i that's what i hope i don't think
 
01:02:35.510 --> 01:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
that's going to happen which means our
 
01:02:39.109 --> 01:02:39.119 align:start position:0%
last meeting will be on the
 
01:02:41.829 --> 01:02:41.839 align:start position:0%
thursday a week from now
 
01:02:44.950 --> 01:02:44.960 align:start position:0%
and that means we're done
 
01:02:47.270 --> 01:02:47.280 align:start position:0%
we have to be done and so any
 
01:02:50.069 --> 01:02:50.079 align:start position:0%
information that comes back to us
 
01:02:51.829 --> 01:02:51.839 align:start position:0%
if possible
 
01:02:51.839 --> 01:02:52.950 align:start position:0%

johnston

01:03:33.190 --> 01:03:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:34.710 --> 01:03:34.720 align:start position:0%
this speaks from a
 
01:03:39.990 --> 01:03:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:42.230 --> 01:03:42.240 align:start position:0%
good morning everyone can you hear me
 
01:03:45.829 --> 01:03:45.839 align:start position:0%
we can thank you um well i basically i
 
01:03:48.150 --> 01:03:48.160 align:start position:0%
just simply wanted to testify
 
01:03:50.390 --> 01:03:50.400 align:start position:0%
this morning because i myself had lived
 
01:03:53.990 --> 01:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
as a transsexual woman for over 22 years
 
01:03:56.789 --> 01:03:56.799 align:start position:0%
however at the age of 41 i became i had
 
01:03:58.870 --> 01:03:58.880 align:start position:0%
a close to death experience when someone
 
01:04:00.950 --> 01:04:00.960 align:start position:0%
had tried to kill me
 
01:04:02.630 --> 01:04:02.640 align:start position:0%
that being said
 
01:04:05.190 --> 01:04:05.200 align:start position:0%
the spirit of god was drawing me to him
 
01:04:07.190 --> 01:04:07.200 align:start position:0%
and i was you know truly unaware of it
 
01:04:09.430 --> 01:04:09.440 align:start position:0%
at that time in my life
 
01:04:12.710 --> 01:04:12.720 align:start position:0%
god began giving me external visions
 
01:04:14.710 --> 01:04:14.720 align:start position:0%
as to how i was living my life as a
 
01:04:16.390 --> 01:04:16.400 align:start position:0%
transgender woman
 
01:04:18.870 --> 01:04:18.880 align:start position:0%
bound to homosexuality
 
01:04:21.349 --> 01:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
and god himself had showed me
 
01:04:23.829 --> 01:04:23.839 align:start position:0%
that he had seen everything that i had
 
01:04:27.589 --> 01:04:27.599 align:start position:0%
done in life in trying to become a woman
 
01:04:29.589 --> 01:04:29.599 align:start position:0%
then god said to me he said honey this
 
01:04:31.270 --> 01:04:31.280 align:start position:0%
isn't you this is what the devil has
 
01:04:32.710 --> 01:04:32.720 align:start position:0%
done to you
 
01:04:34.870 --> 01:04:34.880 align:start position:0%
so i say all this to say
 
01:04:37.029 --> 01:04:37.039 align:start position:0%
that a lot of people are totally unaware
 
01:04:38.870 --> 01:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
of the fact that there is a spiritual
 
01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:41.670 align:start position:0%
of the fact that there is a spiritual
world

01:04:41.670 --> 01:04:41.680 align:start position:0%
world
 
01:04:43.750 --> 01:04:43.760 align:start position:0%
so no matter what a person chooses to
 
01:04:45.829 --> 01:04:45.839 align:start position:0%
put on the birth certificate
 
01:04:47.990 --> 01:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
what truly matters is what god himself
 
01:04:50.549 --> 01:04:50.559 align:start position:0%
has already said in the bible in regards
 
01:04:52.549 --> 01:04:52.559 align:start position:0%
to one's gender
 
01:04:55.029 --> 01:04:55.039 align:start position:0%
god says in the book of genesis chapter
 
01:04:57.190 --> 01:04:57.200 align:start position:0%
5 verse 2 that he
 
01:04:59.270 --> 01:04:59.280 align:start position:0%
created the male and female and that he
 
01:05:01.270 --> 01:05:01.280 align:start position:0%
blessed them and called the mankind in
 
01:05:03.910 --> 01:05:03.920 align:start position:0%
the day that they were created
 
01:05:06.630 --> 01:05:06.640 align:start position:0%
so why would we want to change what god
 
01:05:09.190 --> 01:05:09.200 align:start position:0%
said was good after he created what he
 
01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:11.430 align:start position:0%
said was good after he created what he
created

01:05:11.430 --> 01:05:11.440 align:start position:0%
created
 
01:05:14.309 --> 01:05:14.319 align:start position:0%
so after hearing i mean i myself lived
 
01:05:16.789 --> 01:05:16.799 align:start position:0%
so many years as a trans transgender
 
01:05:20.150 --> 01:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
woman thinking that that was truth
 
01:05:21.910 --> 01:05:21.920 align:start position:0%
but god said to me that there were
 
01:05:24.549 --> 01:05:24.559 align:start position:0%
simply lies that i came into agreement
 
01:05:24.559 --> 01:05:25.910 align:start position:0%
simply lies that i came into agreement
with

01:05:25.910 --> 01:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:26.789 align:start position:0%
with
so

01:05:26.789 --> 01:05:26.799 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:05:28.950 --> 01:05:28.960 align:start position:0%
being ignorant of the knowledges of the
 
01:05:31.349 --> 01:05:31.359 align:start position:0%
truths of god's written word
 
01:05:33.510 --> 01:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
made me sis uh you know susceptible to
 
01:05:35.430 --> 01:05:35.440 align:start position:0%
believing every wind of doctrine or
 
01:05:37.510 --> 01:05:37.520 align:start position:0%
teaching teaching that this
 
01:05:39.829 --> 01:05:39.839 align:start position:0%
world had to offer me
 
01:05:41.750 --> 01:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
simply because i was lacking the truth
 
01:05:43.910 --> 01:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
of god's word
 
01:05:45.990 --> 01:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
god loves transgenders he loves every
 
01:05:48.549 --> 01:05:48.559 align:start position:0%
human being on this earth
 
01:05:50.630 --> 01:05:50.640 align:start position:0%
but we have to realize
 
01:05:53.829 --> 01:05:53.839 align:start position:0%
what truly matters is what god says
 
01:05:56.230 --> 01:05:56.240 align:start position:0%
god himself has magnified his word the
 
01:05:59.430 --> 01:05:59.440 align:start position:0%
bible far above his name
 
01:06:02.309 --> 01:06:02.319 align:start position:0%
i think we as people have we really come
 
01:06:04.789 --> 01:06:04.799 align:start position:0%
to this point in life
 
01:06:07.270 --> 01:06:07.280 align:start position:0%
where we give people the options to
 
01:06:09.029 --> 01:06:09.039 align:start position:0%
change their gender on their birth
 
01:06:09.039 --> 01:06:10.870 align:start position:0%
change their gender on their birth
certificate

01:06:10.870 --> 01:06:10.880 align:start position:0%
certificate
 
01:06:14.630 --> 01:06:14.640 align:start position:0%
that's just a question to chew on
 
01:06:16.950 --> 01:06:16.960 align:start position:0%
i was so scared i don't mean to
 
01:06:19.190 --> 01:06:19.200 align:start position:0%
interrupt you but when i had my personal
 
01:06:21.349 --> 01:06:21.359 align:start position:0%
encounters with god
 
01:06:24.309 --> 01:06:24.319 align:start position:0%
if you could have seen what he showed me
 
01:06:27.029 --> 01:06:27.039 align:start position:0%
i i just sat sat there and trembled
 
01:06:29.589 --> 01:06:29.599 align:start position:0%
in my shoes because i was you know
 
01:06:31.670 --> 01:06:31.680 align:start position:0%
standing now before
 
01:06:35.349 --> 01:06:35.359 align:start position:0%
a living god who is true yes he's the
 
01:06:37.349 --> 01:06:37.359 align:start position:0%
the invisible god
 
01:06:40.069 --> 01:06:40.079 align:start position:0%
but you know if you draw near to god
 
01:06:41.829 --> 01:06:41.839 align:start position:0%
and just simply ask him to reveal
 
01:06:43.750 --> 01:06:43.760 align:start position:0%
himself to you he'll make himself known
 
01:06:44.710 --> 01:06:44.720 align:start position:0%
to you
 
01:06:46.789 --> 01:06:46.799 align:start position:0%
i'm going to stop your testimony here
 
01:06:49.109 --> 01:06:49.119 align:start position:0%
because we are woefully behind schedule
 
01:06:50.870 --> 01:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
but i am going to open it up to
 
01:06:54.230 --> 01:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
questions and the first one comes from
 
01:06:56.470 --> 01:06:56.480 align:start position:0%
uh the chair mark pearson
 
01:06:58.390 --> 01:06:58.400 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:07:01.190 --> 01:07:01.200 align:start position:0%
i know of a few
 
01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:02.309 align:start position:0%
i know of a few
folks

01:07:02.309 --> 01:07:02.319 align:start position:0%
folks
 
01:07:04.789 --> 01:07:04.799 align:start position:0%
who lived as transgenders and for
 
01:07:06.470 --> 01:07:06.480 align:start position:0%
different reasons you mentioned one of
 
01:07:08.150 --> 01:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
them i know of others
 
01:07:10.789 --> 01:07:10.799 align:start position:0%
why they went back to
 
01:07:14.470 --> 01:07:14.480 align:start position:0%
the gender on their original birth
 
01:07:17.270 --> 01:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
certificate so my question when i have a
 
01:07:19.510 --> 01:07:19.520 align:start position:0%
chance to talk to them and now my
 
01:07:21.910 --> 01:07:21.920 align:start position:0%
question for you is
 
01:07:24.870 --> 01:07:24.880 align:start position:0%
was it when you decided and you gave
 
01:07:27.990 --> 01:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
this your reasons for deciding it
 
01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:28.870 align:start position:0%
this your reasons for deciding it
you

01:07:28.870 --> 01:07:28.880 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:07:32.390 --> 01:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
sought to resume your identity as
 
01:07:33.829 --> 01:07:33.839 align:start position:0%
it was
 
01:07:36.230 --> 01:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
on your birth certificate
 
01:07:39.750 --> 01:07:39.760 align:start position:0%
was that relatively easy for you to do
 
01:07:41.510 --> 01:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
when you made your mind up that's what
 
01:07:43.109 --> 01:07:43.119 align:start position:0%
you should do
 
01:07:45.270 --> 01:07:45.280 align:start position:0%
was it easy for me to change my mind is
 
01:07:47.670 --> 01:07:47.680 align:start position:0%
that what you're asking me was it
 
01:07:49.589 --> 01:07:49.599 align:start position:0%
easy for you
 
01:07:49.599 --> 01:07:50.309 align:start position:0%
easy for you
to

01:07:50.309 --> 01:07:50.319 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:07:53.270 --> 01:07:53.280 align:start position:0%
go back to resuming your life and your
 
01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:55.029 align:start position:0%
go back to resuming your life and your
self-identity

01:07:55.029 --> 01:07:55.039 align:start position:0%
self-identity
 
01:07:57.510 --> 01:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
as a man once again well it was
 
01:07:59.109 --> 01:07:59.119 align:start position:0%
incredibly difficult and i don't wash it
 
01:08:01.349 --> 01:08:01.359 align:start position:0%
upon anybody especially after they hear
 
01:08:03.990 --> 01:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
the words of truth from god himself
 
01:08:06.870 --> 01:08:06.880 align:start position:0%
like i said i lived most of my life as a
 
01:08:10.390 --> 01:08:10.400 align:start position:0%
transsexual woman um you know thinking i
 
01:08:12.710 --> 01:08:12.720 align:start position:0%
was doing the right thing
 
01:08:14.309 --> 01:08:14.319 align:start position:0%
um however
 
01:08:16.709 --> 01:08:16.719 align:start position:0%
i never changed my birth certificate i
 
01:08:19.110 --> 01:08:19.120 align:start position:0%
never changed the fact that um
 
01:08:20.950 --> 01:08:20.960 align:start position:0%
you know i was living as a transgender
 
01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:22.829 align:start position:0%
you know i was living as a transgender
female

01:08:22.829 --> 01:08:22.839 align:start position:0%
female
 
01:08:25.510 --> 01:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
um but
 
01:08:28.149 --> 01:08:28.159 align:start position:0%
it was it was difficult there was many
 
01:08:30.950 --> 01:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
tears i mean because when god himself
 
01:08:32.870 --> 01:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
comes into your life and he
 
01:08:35.910 --> 01:08:35.920 align:start position:0%
supernaturally changes your mind and as
 
01:08:37.990 --> 01:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
you develop a relationship with him and
 
01:08:40.630 --> 01:08:40.640 align:start position:0%
read his word his written word the bible
 
01:08:43.510 --> 01:08:43.520 align:start position:0%
it supernaturally renews your mind and i
 
01:08:45.510 --> 01:08:45.520 align:start position:0%
wasn't aware of all those things before
 
01:08:47.590 --> 01:08:47.600 align:start position:0%
you know coming to know god
 
01:08:49.829 --> 01:08:49.839 align:start position:0%
so yes it was incredibly difficult to
 
01:08:51.510 --> 01:08:51.520 align:start position:0%
have to go through
 
01:08:54.470 --> 01:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
uh changing my license back to mail
 
01:08:57.189 --> 01:08:57.199 align:start position:0%
because now here i am in my right mind
 
01:08:59.910 --> 01:08:59.920 align:start position:0%
supernaturally by the power of god
 
01:09:01.430 --> 01:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:09:03.829 --> 01:09:03.839 align:start position:0%
so now i've got to he supernaturally
 
01:09:05.910 --> 01:09:05.920 align:start position:0%
made me hate the breast implants that i
 
01:09:09.110 --> 01:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
had for over 16 years and now i had to
 
01:09:11.349 --> 01:09:11.359 align:start position:0%
go through different procedures to try
 
01:09:11.359 --> 01:09:12.390 align:start position:0%
go through different procedures to try
to

01:09:12.390 --> 01:09:12.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:09:14.550 --> 01:09:14.560 align:start position:0%
go back to my original gender because
 
01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:16.470 align:start position:0%
go back to my original gender because
god

01:09:16.470 --> 01:09:16.480 align:start position:0%
god
 
01:09:18.630 --> 01:09:18.640 align:start position:0%
his spirit you know now lives in my
 
01:09:20.709 --> 01:09:20.719 align:start position:0%
heart so he just works with me and just
 
01:09:20.719 --> 01:09:22.470 align:start position:0%
heart so he just works with me and just
supernaturally

01:09:22.470 --> 01:09:22.480 align:start position:0%
supernaturally
 
01:09:24.789 --> 01:09:24.799 align:start position:0%
took what the devil meant for bad in my
 
01:09:27.110 --> 01:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
life and that is what's significant is
 
01:09:28.789 --> 01:09:28.799 align:start position:0%
because people aren't aware of the
 
01:09:32.149 --> 01:09:32.159 align:start position:0%
demonic activity in the spirit realm mr
 
01:09:33.990 --> 01:09:34.000 align:start position:0%

01:10:42.630 --> 01:10:42.640 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you mr chair and
 
01:10:44.229 --> 01:10:44.239 align:start position:0%
members of the committee you are quite
 
01:10:45.669 --> 01:10:45.679 align:start position:0%
right my name is jeannie herroska and
 
01:10:46.870 --> 01:10:46.880 align:start position:0%
i'm the political director for the
 
01:10:48.709 --> 01:10:48.719 align:start position:0%
american civil liberties union of new
 
01:10:50.550 --> 01:10:50.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire i really appreciate the
 
01:10:52.550 --> 01:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
opportunity to testify this morning in
 
01:10:54.030 --> 01:10:54.040 align:start position:0%
support of
 
01:10:54.040 --> 01:10:55.910 align:start position:0%
support of
hb295

01:10:55.910 --> 01:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
hb295
 
01:10:57.750 --> 01:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
and i'm i'm going to make just a couple
 
01:10:59.750 --> 01:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
points because i i really appreciate
 
01:11:01.830 --> 01:11:01.840 align:start position:0%
everything that representative cannon
 
01:11:03.030 --> 01:11:03.040 align:start position:0%
has already
 
01:11:05.669 --> 01:11:05.679 align:start position:0%
noted um and as you know new hampshire
 
01:11:08.310 --> 01:11:08.320 align:start position:0%
law already allows a person to correct
 
01:11:10.709 --> 01:11:10.719 align:start position:0%
the sex marker on their birth record so
 
01:11:13.270 --> 01:11:13.280 align:start position:0%
this is not changing the law in that
 
01:11:16.229 --> 01:11:16.239 align:start position:0%
respects all it's doing is making the
 
01:11:19.430 --> 01:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
process uh easier and actually making
 
01:11:23.030 --> 01:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
the process uh align with the process
 
01:11:25.910 --> 01:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
that the state already utilizes
 
01:11:29.990 --> 01:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
for correcting other state issued ids
 
01:11:31.669 --> 01:11:31.679 align:start position:0%
and that's the point i really want to
 
01:11:34.470 --> 01:11:34.480 align:start position:0%
underscore is that the goal should be to
 
01:11:37.270 --> 01:11:37.280 align:start position:0%
have a process for amending state issued
 
01:11:40.709 --> 01:11:40.719 align:start position:0%
ids across the board so if you have an
 
01:11:43.590 --> 01:11:43.600 align:start position:0%
affidavit from your health care provider
 
01:11:45.590 --> 01:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
you can use that to go and correct your
 
01:11:47.990 --> 01:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
driver's license and you can then use it
 
01:11:50.709 --> 01:11:50.719 align:start position:0%
to go and correct your birth record
 
01:11:52.830 --> 01:11:52.840 align:start position:0%
to have distinct
 
01:11:55.270 --> 01:11:55.280 align:start position:0%
processes remembering different state
 
01:11:58.310 --> 01:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
issued ids just doesn't make any sense
 
01:12:01.229 --> 01:12:01.239 align:start position:0%
it risks having people walk around with
 
01:12:05.189 --> 01:12:05.199 align:start position:0%
inconsistent state issued ids which
 
01:12:07.590 --> 01:12:07.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't help anybody there are many
 
01:12:10.070 --> 01:12:10.080 align:start position:0%
situations where you present both you
 
01:12:11.910 --> 01:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
present a birth record and a driver's
 
01:12:14.630 --> 01:12:14.640 align:start position:0%
license right you're starting a new job
 
01:12:17.510 --> 01:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
you're getting a mortgage to have
 
01:12:20.070 --> 01:12:20.080 align:start position:0%
inconsistent state ids
 
01:12:22.550 --> 01:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
really risks discrimination
 
01:12:25.910 --> 01:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
it makes great that somebody uh is
 
01:12:28.550 --> 01:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
transgender which is discriminatory and
 
01:12:30.950 --> 01:12:30.960 align:start position:0%
so that our goal with this bill
 
01:12:33.590 --> 01:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
is to just ease the process to take the
 
01:12:35.270 --> 01:12:35.280 align:start position:0%
courts out of it
 
01:12:37.990 --> 01:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
and really allow people to amend their
 
01:12:40.790 --> 01:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
state issued ids at the same time you
 
01:12:42.630 --> 01:12:42.640 align:start position:0%
can amend your driver's license you can
 
01:12:44.630 --> 01:12:44.640 align:start position:0%
amend your birth record they'll be
 
01:12:47.990 --> 01:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
consistent and that should be the goal
 
01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:48.830 align:start position:0%
consistent and that should be the goal
and

01:12:48.830 --> 01:12:48.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:12:52.070 --> 01:12:52.080 align:start position:0%
so sorry for that um so our we really
 
01:12:53.990 --> 01:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
appreciate this bill and just see it as
 
01:12:55.030 --> 01:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
a way
 
01:12:57.830 --> 01:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
uh to bring our statutes in line with
 
01:12:59.910 --> 01:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
each other um it doesn't change the
 
01:13:01.910 --> 01:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
standard it just makes the process a
 
01:13:03.830 --> 01:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
little bit easier and aligns it with the
 
01:13:06.550 --> 01:13:06.560 align:start position:0%
process we already use
 
01:13:09.110 --> 01:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
for amending drivers licenses
 
01:13:10.870 --> 01:13:10.880 align:start position:0%
and with that i'm happy to answer any
 
01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:12.149 align:start position:0%
and with that i'm happy to answer any
questions

01:13:12.149 --> 01:13:12.159 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:13:14.950 --> 01:13:14.960 align:start position:0%
the chair has a question for you
 
01:13:16.709 --> 01:13:16.719 align:start position:0%
i'm not following
 
01:13:20.149 --> 01:13:20.159 align:start position:0%
much of what goes on in washington um
 
01:13:21.990 --> 01:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
at the moment but
 
01:13:26.550 --> 01:13:26.560 align:start position:0%
is there a movement in washington d.c
 
01:13:29.270 --> 01:13:29.280 align:start position:0%
to make a standard
 
01:13:32.790 --> 01:13:32.800 align:start position:0%
procedure on this nationally
 
01:13:35.430 --> 01:13:35.440 align:start position:0%
and i guess a follow-up to that would be
 
01:13:36.950 --> 01:13:36.960 align:start position:0%
could they or is this something that
 
01:13:39.350 --> 01:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
reverts to the states so whatever
 
01:13:41.830 --> 01:13:41.840 align:start position:0%
washington does they wouldn't make
 
01:13:45.510 --> 01:13:45.520 align:start position:0%
one standard for everybody
 
01:13:45.520 --> 01:13:46.470 align:start position:0%
one standard for everybody
uh

01:13:46.470 --> 01:13:46.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:13:47.990 --> 01:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure i'm following the
 
01:13:50.550 --> 01:13:50.560 align:start position:0%
conversations in washington i know that
 
01:13:52.950 --> 01:13:52.960 align:start position:0%
there is consideration about
 
01:13:56.149 --> 01:13:56.159 align:start position:0%
uh passports which is something
 
01:13:57.990 --> 01:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
issued by the federal government but
 
01:13:59.830 --> 01:13:59.840 align:start position:0%
driver's licenses are issued by the
 
01:14:03.270 --> 01:14:03.280 align:start position:0%
state so i think it's perfectly
 
01:14:04.870 --> 01:14:04.880 align:start position:0%
right for the state of new hampshire to
 
01:14:07.669 --> 01:14:07.679 align:start position:0%
amend its own process for its own
 
01:14:09.430 --> 01:14:09.440 align:start position:0%
driver's licenses
 
01:14:10.630 --> 01:14:10.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:14:15.910 --> 01:14:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:17.830 --> 01:14:17.840 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
01:14:19.510 --> 01:14:19.520 align:start position:0%
good to see you again
 
01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:20.390 align:start position:0%
good to see you again
and

01:14:20.390 --> 01:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:14:39.510 --> 01:14:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:40.790 --> 01:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
can you hear me
 
01:14:43.990 --> 01:14:44.000 align:start position:0%
yes yeah sorry for that delay
 
01:14:46.709 --> 01:14:46.719 align:start position:0%
yes my name is shannon mcginley and i am
 
01:14:48.149 --> 01:14:48.159 align:start position:0%
a volunteer executive director for
 
01:14:50.070 --> 01:14:50.080 align:start position:0%
cornerstone action
 
01:14:51.910 --> 01:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
and cornerstone recommends that the
 
01:14:53.830 --> 01:14:53.840 align:start position:0%
committee please vote and expedient to
 
01:14:55.669 --> 01:14:55.679 align:start position:0%
legislate on hb
 
01:14:58.310 --> 01:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
295 relating to the initiation of
 
01:15:00.390 --> 01:15:00.400 align:start position:0%
amending the birth certificates
 
01:15:02.709 --> 01:15:02.719 align:start position:0%
so this in no way undermines the dignity
 
01:15:04.709 --> 01:15:04.719 align:start position:0%
of any new hampshire resident in fact
 
01:15:04.719 --> 01:15:05.510 align:start position:0%
of any new hampshire resident in fact
all

01:15:05.510 --> 01:15:05.520 align:start position:0%
all
 
01:15:07.030 --> 01:15:07.040 align:start position:0%
we all have a common interest in
 
01:15:09.430 --> 01:15:09.440 align:start position:0%
maintaining accurate fact-based records
 
01:15:11.430 --> 01:15:11.440 align:start position:0%
as they relate to public health identity
 
01:15:12.950 --> 01:15:12.960 align:start position:0%
theft and investigations into
 
01:15:15.350 --> 01:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
questionable deaths and it's been said
 
01:15:17.910 --> 01:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
that it's already in state statute under
 
01:15:22.149 --> 01:15:22.159 align:start position:0%
section 5-c colon 87 part 5
 
01:15:25.510 --> 01:15:25.520 align:start position:0%
to amend the birth certificates through
 
01:15:27.990 --> 01:15:28.000 align:start position:0%
a court order if they've had a sex
 
01:15:31.750 --> 01:15:31.760 align:start position:0%
change but this bill will actually amend
 
01:15:34.630 --> 01:15:34.640 align:start position:0%
it so that one it's just one's identity
 
01:15:37.350 --> 01:15:37.360 align:start position:0%
and not a sex change not the process of
 
01:15:39.189 --> 01:15:39.199 align:start position:0%
court order and i would suggest that it
 
01:15:41.430 --> 01:15:41.440 align:start position:0%
would swing the door open for
 
01:15:44.229 --> 01:15:44.239 align:start position:0%
vital records to be changed much more
 
01:15:46.790 --> 01:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
easily much more frequently
 
01:15:49.030 --> 01:15:49.040 align:start position:0%
and society has an important interest in
 
01:15:51.030 --> 01:15:51.040 align:start position:0%
maintaining accurate vital records
 
01:15:52.870 --> 01:15:52.880 align:start position:0%
especially birth records
 
01:15:55.110 --> 01:15:55.120 align:start position:0%
and maintaining accurate birth
 
01:15:57.189 --> 01:15:57.199 align:start position:0%
records does not violate federal or
 
01:15:59.590 --> 01:15:59.600 align:start position:0%
state law we've been collecting vital
 
01:16:02.630 --> 01:16:02.640 align:start position:0%
statistics for over 500 years especially
 
01:16:04.390 --> 01:16:04.400 align:start position:0%
the births the deaths the marriages
 
01:16:06.390 --> 01:16:06.400 align:start position:0%
based on consistent and well-established
 
01:16:09.590 --> 01:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
and understood criteria week today the
 
01:16:12.390 --> 01:16:12.400 align:start position:0%
vital records offices record over 11
 
01:16:14.229 --> 01:16:14.239 align:start position:0%
million vital events annually in the
 
01:16:16.709 --> 01:16:16.719 align:start position:0%
united states and there is simply no
 
01:16:18.630 --> 01:16:18.640 align:start position:0%
federal or state law that requires us to
 
01:16:20.709 --> 01:16:20.719 align:start position:0%
change those criteria to replace
 
01:16:23.110 --> 01:16:23.120 align:start position:0%
objectively defined sex with the
 
01:16:25.110 --> 01:16:25.120 align:start position:0%
subjective classification of gender
 
01:16:27.590 --> 01:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
identity for example in the covid um
 
01:16:29.830 --> 01:16:29.840 align:start position:0%
pandemic it's there's an example of
 
01:16:31.750 --> 01:16:31.760 align:start position:0%
where having accurate information of a
 
01:16:33.990 --> 01:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
person's sex is necessary for diagnosis
 
01:16:35.510 --> 01:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
treatment and better understanding of
 
01:16:38.310 --> 01:16:38.320 align:start position:0%
the disease i've seen numerous articles
 
01:16:41.030 --> 01:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
um lining laying out how males are being
 
01:16:43.990 --> 01:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
identified as a risk factor for death
 
01:16:46.870 --> 01:16:46.880 align:start position:0%
and icu admission for example
 
01:16:48.310 --> 01:16:48.320 align:start position:0%
and i'll include one of those articles
 
01:16:50.310 --> 01:16:50.320 align:start position:0%
in my written testimonies
 
01:16:52.550 --> 01:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
also um
 
01:16:54.630 --> 01:16:54.640 align:start position:0%
allowing individuals to alter their
 
01:16:55.990 --> 01:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
vital records including birth
 
01:16:57.750 --> 01:16:57.760 align:start position:0%
certificates based on subjective
 
01:16:59.750 --> 01:16:59.760 align:start position:0%
feelings or experiences undermines the
 
01:17:01.590 --> 01:17:01.600 align:start position:0%
government and the people's interest in
 
01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:02.550 align:start position:0%
government and the people's interest in
having

01:17:02.550 --> 01:17:02.560 align:start position:0%
having
 
01:17:05.590 --> 01:17:05.600 align:start position:0%
an accurate vital record database so for
 
01:17:07.750 --> 01:17:07.760 align:start position:0%
example if we're able to streamline and
 
01:17:10.470 --> 01:17:10.480 align:start position:0%
make this easier to change their gender
 
01:17:10.480 --> 01:17:11.830 align:start position:0%
make this easier to change their gender
identity

01:17:11.830 --> 01:17:11.840 align:start position:0%
identity
 
01:17:13.590 --> 01:17:13.600 align:start position:0%
what if you have a situation where a
 
01:17:15.430 --> 01:17:15.440 align:start position:0%
gentleman in his 70s who believes that
 
01:17:17.110 --> 01:17:17.120 align:start position:0%
he has the appearance and identity of a
 
01:17:19.270 --> 01:17:19.280 align:start position:0%
40 year old man the state would not
 
01:17:21.350 --> 01:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
allow him to retroactively change his
 
01:17:23.830 --> 01:17:23.840 align:start position:0%
the date of birth by 30 years in order
 
01:17:25.990 --> 01:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
to conform to how he looks or how he
 
01:17:27.990 --> 01:17:28.000 align:start position:0%
feels or the same might be true of a
 
01:17:30.229 --> 01:17:30.239 align:start position:0%
person who's been born in new mexico but
 
01:17:32.550 --> 01:17:32.560 align:start position:0%
feels more at home as an iowan while
 
01:17:34.870 --> 01:17:34.880 align:start position:0%
that person may identify as an iowan it
 
01:17:36.550 --> 01:17:36.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't change the fact that he was born
 
01:17:38.950 --> 01:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
in new mexico where do we draw the line
 
01:17:40.790 --> 01:17:40.800 align:start position:0%
in terms of what it is that we're
 
01:17:42.390 --> 01:17:42.400 align:start position:0%
changing on
 
01:17:45.110 --> 01:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
our our vital records several states
 
01:17:46.950 --> 01:17:46.960 align:start position:0%
don't allow for marginal notes and i
 
01:17:48.870 --> 01:17:48.880 align:start position:0%
fear that the transgender community
 
01:17:50.870 --> 01:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
would come back to remove this marginal
 
01:17:53.030 --> 01:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
note therefore just completely wiping
 
01:17:55.830 --> 01:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
out any kind of record of what it was
 
01:17:55.840 --> 01:17:57.350 align:start position:0%
out any kind of record of what it was
originally

01:17:57.350 --> 01:17:57.360 align:start position:0%
originally
 
01:17:58.790 --> 01:17:58.800 align:start position:0%
you know facts can never be
 
01:18:01.350 --> 01:18:01.360 align:start position:0%
discriminatory birth certificates death
 
01:18:03.910 --> 01:18:03.920 align:start position:0%
records and so forth are attended they
 
01:18:06.630 --> 01:18:06.640 align:start position:0%
are intended to document facts efforts
 
01:18:08.950 --> 01:18:08.960 align:start position:0%
to attribute to any further purposes to
 
01:18:10.709 --> 01:18:10.719 align:start position:0%
them such as affirming a person's
 
01:18:13.110 --> 01:18:13.120 align:start position:0%
internal sense of age their sex or
 
01:18:14.790 --> 01:18:14.800 align:start position:0%
locality of birth or counter to the
 
01:18:17.270 --> 01:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
government's vital interest in having
 
01:18:19.270 --> 01:18:19.280 align:start position:0%
accurate information
 
01:18:21.270 --> 01:18:21.280 align:start position:0%
and furthermore in america we've become
 
01:18:23.110 --> 01:18:23.120 align:start position:0%
more tolerant accepting of individuals
 
01:18:25.189 --> 01:18:25.199 align:start position:0%
who identify as transgender than ever
 
01:18:26.950 --> 01:18:26.960 align:start position:0%
before and in fact you could argue that
 
01:18:29.270 --> 01:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
their biological sex is an intrinsic
 
01:18:31.030 --> 01:18:31.040 align:start position:0%
part of their story
 
01:18:32.470 --> 01:18:32.480 align:start position:0%
treating them with the dignity and
 
01:18:34.709 --> 01:18:34.719 align:start position:0%
respect that all persons are entitled to
 
01:18:36.790 --> 01:18:36.800 align:start position:0%
receive does not mean that we erase
 
01:18:39.350 --> 01:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
certain factual information especially
 
01:18:41.030 --> 01:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
when that helps the government better
 
01:18:43.350 --> 01:18:43.360 align:start position:0%
protect its health the health and safety
 
01:18:44.950 --> 01:18:44.960 align:start position:0%
of its citizens
 
01:18:47.110 --> 01:18:47.120 align:start position:0%
under new hampshire law the birth
 
01:18:48.870 --> 01:18:48.880 align:start position:0%
certificate is required to include the
 
01:18:50.870 --> 01:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
sex of the individual and factual
 
01:18:52.950 --> 01:18:52.960 align:start position:0%
information regarding the person sex is
 
01:18:55.189 --> 01:18:55.199 align:start position:0%
among the vital statistics that new
 
01:18:57.910 --> 01:18:57.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire law requires to be maintained
 
01:19:01.750 --> 01:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
but yet in hb 295's proposed revisions
 
01:19:04.310 --> 01:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
to our law attempt to erase any mention
 
01:19:06.390 --> 01:19:06.400 align:start position:0%
of the objective biological designation
 
01:19:08.550 --> 01:19:08.560 align:start position:0%
of sex and replace it with the vague
 
01:19:11.110 --> 01:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
term of gender identity to establish
 
01:19:14.070 --> 01:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
gender identity one would only show that
 
01:19:16.149 --> 01:19:16.159 align:start position:0%
it is their sincerely held belief
 
01:19:18.390 --> 01:19:18.400 align:start position:0%
verified by someone in the medical and
 
01:19:21.189 --> 01:19:21.199 align:start position:0%
counseling community i would also just
 
01:19:23.350 --> 01:19:23.360 align:start position:0%
point out to you that this bill refers
 
01:19:26.229 --> 01:19:26.239 align:start position:0%
to minors and allowing them to change
 
01:19:28.390 --> 01:19:28.400 align:start position:0%
their um birth records and i believe
 
01:19:30.149 --> 01:19:30.159 align:start position:0%
that it further pushes them down the
 
01:19:32.870 --> 01:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
road of gender dysphoria and studies
 
01:19:34.709 --> 01:19:34.719 align:start position:0%
have shown that 80 to 90 percent of
 
01:19:36.709 --> 01:19:36.719 align:start position:0%
adolescents will identify as their
 
01:19:38.550 --> 01:19:38.560 align:start position:0%
biological sex as they pass through
 
01:19:39.990 --> 01:19:40.000 align:start position:0%
puberty if
 
01:19:42.790 --> 01:19:42.800 align:start position:0%
if their alternative gender identity is
 
01:19:45.510 --> 01:19:45.520 align:start position:0%
not being affirmed to allow the process
 
01:19:47.750 --> 01:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
of puberty etc to take over and i feel
 
01:19:50.149 --> 01:19:50.159 align:start position:0%
like that this would just further you
 
01:19:52.709 --> 01:19:52.719 align:start position:0%
know encourage them to go through that
 
01:19:54.870 --> 01:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
process unnecessarily and new
 
01:19:57.110 --> 01:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire's vital records should not be
 
01:19:59.750 --> 01:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
based upon subjective feelings however
 
01:20:01.910 --> 01:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
sincerely held rather they should be
 
01:20:03.990 --> 01:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
based upon the facts including factual
 
01:20:06.070 --> 01:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
information regarding a person a
 
01:20:08.149 --> 01:20:08.159 align:start position:0%
person's biological sex
 
01:20:09.590 --> 01:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
at birth
 
01:20:11.270 --> 01:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to take any questions thank
 
01:20:13.590 --> 01:20:13.600 align:start position:0%
you to the committee for your time
 
01:20:16.709 --> 01:20:16.719 align:start position:0%
the chair has one and
 
01:20:18.950 --> 01:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
i'm not a medical person although i'm
 
01:20:21.830 --> 01:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
usually surrounded by such uh and i
 
01:20:24.709 --> 01:20:24.719 align:start position:0%
don't think you are a medical person but
 
01:20:26.790 --> 01:20:26.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't don't we
 
01:20:31.030 --> 01:20:31.040 align:start position:0%
extract policies on
 
01:20:31.040 --> 01:20:32.390 align:start position:0%
extract policies on
infant

01:20:32.390 --> 01:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
infant
 
01:20:36.790 --> 01:20:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:40.470 --> 01:20:40.480 align:start position:0%
various other things based on what that
 
01:20:43.510 --> 01:20:43.520 align:start position:0%
birth certificate says um
 
01:20:45.750 --> 01:20:45.760 align:start position:0%
in other words that gives us information
 
01:20:47.910 --> 01:20:47.920 align:start position:0%
and now the information
 
01:20:50.550 --> 01:20:50.560 align:start position:0%
were to become
 
01:20:50.560 --> 01:20:52.229 align:start position:0%
were to become
changed

01:20:52.229 --> 01:20:52.239 align:start position:0%
changed
 
01:20:56.070 --> 01:20:56.080 align:start position:0%
correct like say for example like
 
01:20:57.910 --> 01:20:57.920 align:start position:0%
yeah yes i mean i was trying to allude
 
01:21:00.390 --> 01:21:00.400 align:start position:0%
to that in my testimony about collecting
 
01:21:02.229 --> 01:21:02.239 align:start position:0%
health statistics so say for example if
 
01:21:03.590 --> 01:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
you want to look at like the infants i
 
01:21:05.189 --> 01:21:05.199 align:start position:0%
know i was using the example of covet
 
01:21:06.709 --> 01:21:06.719 align:start position:0%
just because we're all in the middle of
 
01:21:09.510 --> 01:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
living it but to your point though mr
 
01:21:11.270 --> 01:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
chairman if you take into
 
01:21:13.510 --> 01:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
the example from like flint michigan
 
01:21:15.750 --> 01:21:15.760 align:start position:0%
with the lead contamination and so forth
 
01:21:17.590 --> 01:21:17.600 align:start position:0%
that you know certainly you would want
 
01:21:21.110 --> 01:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
to see patterns of contamination and how
 
01:21:23.030 --> 01:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
it's affecting you know infants and
 
01:21:25.270 --> 01:21:25.280 align:start position:0%
children and so forth if it bear has any
 
01:21:27.110 --> 01:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
bearing on the males and the females and
 
01:21:29.590 --> 01:21:29.600 align:start position:0%
so forth so yes i would agree with your
 
01:21:29.600 --> 01:21:31.669 align:start position:0%
so forth so yes i would agree with your
statement

01:21:31.669 --> 01:21:31.679 align:start position:0%
statement
 
01:21:36.709 --> 01:21:36.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:38.630 --> 01:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
01:21:40.390 --> 01:21:40.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:21:40.400 --> 01:21:41.350 align:start position:0%
thank you

all right uh thank you mr chair and
 
01:22:17.189 --> 01:22:17.199 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for taking my
 
01:22:18.870 --> 01:22:18.880 align:start position:0%
testimony today my name is sofia
 
01:22:20.149 --> 01:22:20.159 align:start position:0%
biandolila you actually said it
 
01:22:23.189 --> 01:22:23.199 align:start position:0%
perfectly um i'm 14 i live in manchester
 
01:22:24.550 --> 01:22:24.560 align:start position:0%
and i'm speaking today on behalf of the
 
01:22:25.910 --> 01:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
new hampshire high school democrats in
 
01:22:28.950 --> 01:22:28.960 align:start position:0%
support of hb 295
 
01:22:31.030 --> 01:22:31.040 align:start position:0%
hb 295 would create a standardized
 
01:22:32.470 --> 01:22:32.480 align:start position:0%
process to allow thousands in new
 
01:22:33.990 --> 01:22:34.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire to be correctly identified on
 
01:22:35.590 --> 01:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
their birth certificate doing so would
 
01:22:37.510 --> 01:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
have multiple benefits first of all many
 
01:22:38.870 --> 01:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
transgender people suffer from a
 
01:22:40.870 --> 01:22:40.880 align:start position:0%
condition called gender dysphoria the
 
01:22:42.790 --> 01:22:42.800 align:start position:0%
american psychiatric association defines
 
01:22:44.390 --> 01:22:44.400 align:start position:0%
this as a psychological distress that
 
01:22:45.910 --> 01:22:45.920 align:start position:0%
results from an incongruence between one
 
01:22:47.510 --> 01:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
sex assigned at birth and one's gender
 
01:22:47.520 --> 01:22:48.790 align:start position:0%
sex assigned at birth and one's gender
identity

01:22:48.790 --> 01:22:48.800 align:start position:0%
identity
 
01:22:50.310 --> 01:22:50.320 align:start position:0%
this dysphoria could be triggered very
 
01:22:51.830 --> 01:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
easily by a situation where someone is
 
01:22:53.270 --> 01:22:53.280 align:start position:0%
not correctly identified on their birth
 
01:22:53.280 --> 01:22:54.550 align:start position:0%
not correctly identified on their birth
certificate

01:22:54.550 --> 01:22:54.560 align:start position:0%
certificate
 
01:22:56.070 --> 01:22:56.080 align:start position:0%
for many trans people being associated
 
01:22:57.830 --> 01:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
with their gender assigned at birth can
 
01:22:59.510 --> 01:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
can bring back traumatizing memories and
 
01:23:00.950 --> 01:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
create a stressful situation that might
 
01:23:03.590 --> 01:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
seriously impact their mental health
 
01:23:05.030 --> 01:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
secondly in a situation where a person's
 
01:23:06.790 --> 01:23:06.800 align:start position:0%
birth records do not align with how they
 
01:23:08.709 --> 01:23:08.719 align:start position:0%
look and present there could be relating
 
01:23:10.229 --> 01:23:10.239 align:start position:0%
resulting issues when that person tries
 
01:23:11.830 --> 01:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
to sign up for a government program or
 
01:23:13.270 --> 01:23:13.280 align:start position:0%
get a driver's license or whatever it
 
01:23:14.950 --> 01:23:14.960 align:start position:0%
may be because they will be forced to
 
01:23:16.310 --> 01:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
explain this difference and not only
 
01:23:18.070 --> 01:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
would this open them up to misgendering
 
01:23:19.430 --> 01:23:19.440 align:start position:0%
and transphobia but it could be
 
01:23:21.270 --> 01:23:21.280 align:start position:0%
traumatic for many of these people for
 
01:23:23.270 --> 01:23:23.280 align:start position:0%
all the same reasons
 
01:23:24.470 --> 01:23:24.480 align:start position:0%
the language of the bill says that a
 
01:23:25.830 --> 01:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
licensed health care provider must
 
01:23:25.840 --> 01:23:26.790 align:start position:0%
licensed health care provider must
provide

01:23:26.790 --> 01:23:26.800 align:start position:0%
provide
 
01:23:28.149 --> 01:23:28.159 align:start position:0%
evidence that in simpler terms the
 
01:23:29.270 --> 01:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
person trying to change their birth
 
01:23:31.430 --> 01:23:31.440 align:start position:0%
certificate is actually transgender and
 
01:23:32.629 --> 01:23:32.639 align:start position:0%
although that might sound a little too
 
01:23:35.189 --> 01:23:35.199 align:start position:0%
forgiving for some of you um i can i
 
01:23:36.629 --> 01:23:36.639 align:start position:0%
want to emphasize that with my
 
01:23:38.470 --> 01:23:38.480 align:start position:0%
experience with counselors and doctors
 
01:23:40.470 --> 01:23:40.480 align:start position:0%
and other transgender people who are in
 
01:23:42.870 --> 01:23:42.880 align:start position:0%
similar situations to me
 
01:23:44.629 --> 01:23:44.639 align:start position:0%
that type of decision would not be taken
 
01:23:46.229 --> 01:23:46.239 align:start position:0%
lightly by these providers it would not
 
01:23:47.910 --> 01:23:47.920 align:start position:0%
be something somebody could just do if
 
01:23:49.590 --> 01:23:49.600 align:start position:0%
they wanted to whenever they want um
 
01:23:50.709 --> 01:23:50.719 align:start position:0%
it's like these are licensed
 
01:23:52.550 --> 01:23:52.560 align:start position:0%
professionals in our state and they know
 
01:23:53.750 --> 01:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
how to weigh the pros and cons of these
 
01:23:55.110 --> 01:23:55.120 align:start position:0%
decisions and they take their practice
 
01:23:56.390 --> 01:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
very seriously
 
01:23:58.070 --> 01:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
um and this bill would allow those most
 
01:23:59.590 --> 01:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
qualified to make these decisions and
 
01:24:00.790 --> 01:24:00.800 align:start position:0%
determine what is best for their
 
01:24:03.110 --> 01:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
patients um there are a few things that
 
01:24:04.709 --> 01:24:04.719 align:start position:0%
i haven't written down but
 
01:24:07.110 --> 01:24:07.120 align:start position:0%
i just like to point out that um in my
 
01:24:09.110 --> 01:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
own research i've seen studies that have
 
01:24:11.189 --> 01:24:11.199 align:start position:0%
proven that even among adolescents who
 
01:24:13.910 --> 01:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
transition at maybe an earlier age
 
01:24:17.350 --> 01:24:17.360 align:start position:0%
detransitioning is not a major part of
 
01:24:18.950 --> 01:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
like the live trans experience in this
 
01:24:21.910 --> 01:24:21.920 align:start position:0%
country um i i saw a study i can't
 
01:24:23.430 --> 01:24:23.440 align:start position:0%
remember exactly what was done but it
 
01:24:25.189 --> 01:24:25.199 align:start position:0%
was very recently um
 
01:24:27.510 --> 01:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
where they studied about 400 people and
 
01:24:28.870 --> 01:24:28.880 align:start position:0%
there was only two
 
01:24:30.629 --> 01:24:30.639 align:start position:0%
who had any sort of regrets after
 
01:24:31.990 --> 01:24:32.000 align:start position:0%
transitioning and they also studied
 
01:24:33.990 --> 01:24:34.000 align:start position:0%
adolescence in that study i believe
 
01:24:36.149 --> 01:24:36.159 align:start position:0%
so i don't think that detransitioning is
 
01:24:37.510 --> 01:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
a major thing that we have to be worried
 
01:24:38.870 --> 01:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
about and again this is just a very
 
01:24:38.880 --> 01:24:39.910 align:start position:0%
about and again this is just a very
simple

01:24:39.910 --> 01:24:39.920 align:start position:0%
simple
 
01:24:42.310 --> 01:24:42.320 align:start position:0%
um simple change it wouldn't be opening
 
01:24:44.629 --> 01:24:44.639 align:start position:0%
up to fraud or any sort of
 
01:24:45.910 --> 01:24:45.920 align:start position:0%
skewed data i don't think that would be
 
01:24:47.669 --> 01:24:47.679 align:start position:0%
a major issue and even if it would ski
 
01:24:49.110 --> 01:24:49.120 align:start position:0%
the data it would skew the data towards
 
01:24:50.229 --> 01:24:50.239 align:start position:0%
being more accurate because it would
 
01:24:51.830 --> 01:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
accurately represent how these people
 
01:24:51.840 --> 01:24:53.270 align:start position:0%
accurately represent how these people
are

01:24:53.270 --> 01:24:53.280 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:24:55.110 --> 01:24:55.120 align:start position:0%
identifying and presenting to the rest
 
01:24:56.310 --> 01:24:56.320 align:start position:0%
of the world
 
01:24:58.390 --> 01:24:58.400 align:start position:0%
so in summary allowing transgender
 
01:24:59.750 --> 01:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
people to change the indicator on their
 
01:25:01.430 --> 01:25:01.440 align:start position:0%
birth certificate would be a simple fix
 
01:25:03.030 --> 01:25:03.040 align:start position:0%
that would prevent traumatic situations
 
01:25:04.390 --> 01:25:04.400 align:start position:0%
and would significantly improve the
 
01:25:05.910 --> 01:25:05.920 align:start position:0%
lives of thousands of transgender people
 
01:25:07.510 --> 01:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire and for all of these
 
01:25:08.629 --> 01:25:08.639 align:start position:0%
reasons i asked the committee to
 
01:25:10.950 --> 01:25:10.960 align:start position:0%
recommend optopass on hb295 thank you
 
01:25:14.550 --> 01:25:14.560 align:start position:0%
for your time thank you very much and i
 
01:25:14.560 --> 01:25:15.830 align:start position:0%
for your time thank you very much and i
um

01:25:15.830 --> 01:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:17.510 --> 01:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
skipped over somebody that i should have
 
01:25:20.229 --> 01:25:20.239 align:start position:0%
called earlier and i apologize for that
 
01:25:23.270 --> 01:25:23.280 align:start position:0%
uh kelly bruniak from the new hampshire
 
01:25:29.669 --> 01:25:29.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:32.149 --> 01:25:32.159 align:start position:0%
good morning can everyone hear me we can
 
01:25:34.709 --> 01:25:34.719 align:start position:0%
hear you all right great i will be quick
 
01:25:36.629 --> 01:25:36.639 align:start position:0%
thank you for giving me the opportunity
 
01:25:37.669 --> 01:25:37.679 align:start position:0%
to speak
 
01:25:39.110 --> 01:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
we just wanted to mention although we
 
01:25:41.750 --> 01:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
are neutral on this bill that the dmv is
 
01:25:44.070 --> 01:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
watching it because we want to make sure
 
01:25:44.080 --> 01:25:45.110 align:start position:0%
watching it because we want to make sure
that

01:25:45.110 --> 01:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:25:47.669 --> 01:25:47.679 align:start position:0%
how what our requirements are to change
 
01:25:49.590 --> 01:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
the gender designation
 
01:25:51.189 --> 01:25:51.199 align:start position:0%
on a new hampshire driver license or
 
01:25:53.830 --> 01:25:53.840 align:start position:0%
non-driver id card is consistent with
 
01:25:57.350 --> 01:25:57.360 align:start position:0%
anything else that is out there we do as
 
01:25:59.669 --> 01:25:59.679 align:start position:0%
the representative cannon has
 
01:26:02.149 --> 01:26:02.159 align:start position:0%
stated we do have a process in place
 
01:26:05.590 --> 01:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
we will make sure that any rules that we
 
01:26:07.270 --> 01:26:07.280 align:start position:0%
have need to be updated we will be
 
01:26:08.790 --> 01:26:08.800 align:start position:0%
following that
 
01:26:11.669 --> 01:26:11.679 align:start position:0%
we also will be making sure that we are
 
01:26:14.070 --> 01:26:14.080 align:start position:0%
looking at updating our rules to include
 
01:26:15.990 --> 01:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
physicians assistants
 
01:26:18.470 --> 01:26:18.480 align:start position:0%
as someone that can complete our current
 
01:26:18.480 --> 01:26:19.510 align:start position:0%
as someone that can complete our current
form

01:26:19.510 --> 01:26:19.520 align:start position:0%
form
 
01:26:25.750 --> 01:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:27.590 --> 01:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
all right thank you for the opportunity
 
01:26:29.350 --> 01:26:29.360 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:26:49.189 --> 01:26:49.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:50.390 --> 01:26:50.400 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
01:26:52.629 --> 01:26:52.639 align:start position:0%
good morning okay
 
01:26:54.229 --> 01:26:54.239 align:start position:0%
mr chairman members of the committee
 
01:26:56.629 --> 01:26:56.639 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my testimony which
 
01:26:59.350 --> 01:26:59.360 align:start position:0%
is against house bill 295 my name is
 
01:27:02.070 --> 01:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
richard johnson and i am a physician
 
01:27:04.470 --> 01:27:04.480 align:start position:0%
a person's gender or gender gender
 
01:27:07.430 --> 01:27:07.440 align:start position:0%
identity does not change their sex at
 
01:27:09.910 --> 01:27:09.920 align:start position:0%
present one can take hormones have top
 
01:27:12.229 --> 01:27:12.239 align:start position:0%
and bottom surgery all to make one more
 
01:27:14.470 --> 01:27:14.480 align:start position:0%
comfortable in their chosen gender be it
 
01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:15.350 align:start position:0%
comfortable in their chosen gender be it
male

01:27:15.350 --> 01:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
male
 
01:27:17.669 --> 01:27:17.679 align:start position:0%
female fluid or neutral
 
01:27:20.390 --> 01:27:20.400 align:start position:0%
but you cannot change your chromosomes
 
01:27:22.550 --> 01:27:22.560 align:start position:0%
the purpose of a birth certificate is to
 
01:27:25.669 --> 01:27:25.679 align:start position:0%
record factual data not preferences
 
01:27:27.030 --> 01:27:27.040 align:start position:0%
i might re
 
01:27:29.350 --> 01:27:29.360 align:start position:0%
i might prefer to be viewed and treated
 
01:27:31.669 --> 01:27:31.679 align:start position:0%
either older or younger than i am but
 
01:27:33.510 --> 01:27:33.520 align:start position:0%
that does not entitle me to change my
 
01:27:34.790 --> 01:27:34.800 align:start position:0%
birth date
 
01:27:36.870 --> 01:27:36.880 align:start position:0%
there's another factor to consider each
 
01:27:38.870 --> 01:27:38.880 align:start position:0%
year a portion of the population is born
 
01:27:41.350 --> 01:27:41.360 align:start position:0%
with biological characteristics such as
 
01:27:44.629 --> 01:27:44.639 align:start position:0%
sex chromosomes gonads genital hormones
 
01:27:47.750 --> 01:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
or a combination that don't fit textbook
 
01:27:50.149 --> 01:27:50.159 align:start position:0%
definitions of male or female
 
01:27:51.830 --> 01:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
the number of births where the baby is
 
01:27:53.910 --> 01:27:53.920 align:start position:0%
intersex have been reported to be as low
 
01:27:53.920 --> 01:27:54.830 align:start position:0%
intersex have been reported to be as low
as

01:27:54.830 --> 01:27:54.840 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:27:58.550 --> 01:27:58.560 align:start position:0%
0.018 percent or as high as 1.7 percent
 
01:28:00.070 --> 01:28:00.080 align:start position:0%
depending on which conditions are
 
01:28:01.910 --> 01:28:01.920 align:start position:0%
counted as intersex
 
01:28:03.990 --> 01:28:04.000 align:start position:0%
for the child with both an ovarian a
 
01:28:06.790 --> 01:28:06.800 align:start position:0%
testicle which do they want to keep
 
01:28:08.709 --> 01:28:08.719 align:start position:0%
will they want to identify as male or
 
01:28:08.719 --> 01:28:10.070 align:start position:0%
will they want to identify as male or
female

01:28:10.070 --> 01:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
female
 
01:28:12.390 --> 01:28:12.400 align:start position:0%
how will the child who has a testicle
 
01:28:14.390 --> 01:28:14.400 align:start position:0%
and a uterus but no vagina
 
01:28:16.070 --> 01:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
want to identify
 
01:28:18.070 --> 01:28:18.080 align:start position:0%
these individuals need to be given the
 
01:28:19.750 --> 01:28:19.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity to participate in the
 
01:28:22.390 --> 01:28:22.400 align:start position:0%
decisions for surgical medical care and
 
01:28:24.790 --> 01:28:24.800 align:start position:0%
make their own decision on sexual
 
01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:26.310 align:start position:0%
make their own decision on sexual
identification

01:28:26.310 --> 01:28:26.320 align:start position:0%
identification
 
01:28:28.070 --> 01:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
i call this to your attention because it
 
01:28:30.070 --> 01:28:30.080 align:start position:0%
is in the area of disorders or
 
01:28:32.550 --> 01:28:32.560 align:start position:0%
differences of sexual development that
 
01:28:34.470 --> 01:28:34.480 align:start position:0%
there should be a box on the birth
 
01:28:37.110 --> 01:28:37.120 align:start position:0%
certificate for the physician to check
 
01:28:39.270 --> 01:28:39.280 align:start position:0%
that says indeterminate
 
01:28:41.030 --> 01:28:41.040 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the birth certificate is
 
01:28:43.590 --> 01:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
to record factual data not gender
 
01:28:45.990 --> 01:28:46.000 align:start position:0%
preferences gender identity or sexual
 
01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:47.430 align:start position:0%
preferences gender identity or sexual
orientation

01:28:47.430 --> 01:28:47.440 align:start position:0%
orientation
 
01:28:49.430 --> 01:28:49.440 align:start position:0%
this bill should not become law because
 
01:28:51.350 --> 01:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
one it does not address the problem of
 
01:28:53.590 --> 01:28:53.600 align:start position:0%
children born with disorders of sexual
 
01:28:55.910 --> 01:28:55.920 align:start position:0%
development and secondly it negates
 
01:28:58.790 --> 01:28:58.800 align:start position:0%
biological fact with gender preference
 
01:29:00.629 --> 01:29:00.639 align:start position:0%
this is not the purpose of a birth
 
01:29:02.870 --> 01:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
certificate thank you for taking my
 
01:29:02.880 --> 01:29:04.870 align:start position:0%

01:29:56.149 --> 01:29:56.159 align:start position:0%
hi um i am the mother of a transgender
 
01:29:59.270 --> 01:29:59.280 align:start position:0%
teenager who is um set to testify and i
 
01:30:02.229 --> 01:30:02.239 align:start position:0%
think if it's possible for me to have
 
01:30:04.149 --> 01:30:04.159 align:start position:0%
lane be pulled up instead of me i think
 
01:30:05.750 --> 01:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
her testimony is going to be more
 
01:30:08.070 --> 01:30:08.080 align:start position:0%
compelling and she has to go to class
 
01:30:10.149 --> 01:30:10.159 align:start position:0%
so is it possible for you she's on her
 
01:30:11.750 --> 01:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
own zoom it would is it possible for you
 
01:30:13.750 --> 01:30:13.760 align:start position:0%
to grab her instead of me
 
01:30:17.270 --> 01:30:17.280 align:start position:0%
i don't have her on the list but
 
01:30:21.189 --> 01:30:21.199 align:start position:0%
i'm right here can you hear me right now
 
01:30:22.709 --> 01:30:22.719 align:start position:0%

01:31:18.149 --> 01:31:18.159 align:start position:0%
ensues the fact that my own gender isn't
 
01:31:20.229 --> 01:31:20.239 align:start position:0%
reflected in that and an idea i use
 
01:31:22.790 --> 01:31:22.800 align:start position:0%
often is to be honest painful and
 
01:31:22.800 --> 01:31:24.390 align:start position:0%
often is to be honest painful and
infuriating

01:31:24.390 --> 01:31:24.400 align:start position:0%
infuriating
 
01:31:26.709 --> 01:31:26.719 align:start position:0%
whenever i travel i use my passport as
 
01:31:27.910 --> 01:31:27.920 align:start position:0%
an id
 
01:31:30.149 --> 01:31:30.159 align:start position:0%
each time i stand before an airport
 
01:31:32.470 --> 01:31:32.480 align:start position:0%
official i am scared and anxious i see
 
01:31:34.870 --> 01:31:34.880 align:start position:0%
them notice that my id says boy they
 
01:31:37.030 --> 01:31:37.040 align:start position:0%
look up at me and back to the passport
 
01:31:39.430 --> 01:31:39.440 align:start position:0%
and then back to me looking befuddled my
 
01:31:40.709 --> 01:31:40.719 align:start position:0%
heart starts beating and i start
 
01:31:43.030 --> 01:31:43.040 align:start position:0%
sweating petrified that i'll get pulled
 
01:31:45.270 --> 01:31:45.280 align:start position:0%
aside or questioned in public
 
01:31:46.950 --> 01:31:46.960 align:start position:0%
this spring i am attempting to take the
 
01:31:48.229 --> 01:31:48.239 align:start position:0%
driving exam
 
01:31:51.270 --> 01:31:51.280 align:start position:0%
my license should reflect who i am i
 
01:31:52.229 --> 01:31:52.239 align:start position:0%
should not be
 
01:31:54.470 --> 01:31:54.480 align:start position:0%
i should not be misgendered every single
 
01:31:56.709 --> 01:31:56.719 align:start position:0%
time i go to a new doctor or be forced
 
01:31:58.950 --> 01:31:58.960 align:start position:0%
to explain things to the sat board with
 
01:32:00.070 --> 01:32:00.080 align:start position:0%
the hope that they will update their
 
01:32:02.550 --> 01:32:02.560 align:start position:0%
information so it doesn't disqualify me
 
01:32:04.229 --> 01:32:04.239 align:start position:0%
this bill would streamline the process
 
01:32:06.629 --> 01:32:06.639 align:start position:0%
for me currently i'm waiting for a court
 
01:32:09.270 --> 01:32:09.280 align:start position:0%
date to get my birth certificate amended
 
01:32:12.149 --> 01:32:12.159 align:start position:0%
i hope and pray that the judge who hears
 
01:32:14.310 --> 01:32:14.320 align:start position:0%
my case understands what it means to be
 
01:32:16.470 --> 01:32:16.480 align:start position:0%
transgender and doesn't force me to wait
 
01:32:18.790 --> 01:32:18.800 align:start position:0%
until i get gender confirmation surgery
 
01:32:20.550 --> 01:32:20.560 align:start position:0%
i have a letter from a doctor explaining
 
01:32:22.070 --> 01:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
that i have been living as my authentic
 
01:32:24.709 --> 01:32:24.719 align:start position:0%
self for six years and have undergone
 
01:32:26.629 --> 01:32:26.639 align:start position:0%
medical treatment
 
01:32:29.350 --> 01:32:29.360 align:start position:0%
being transgender is not easy but this
 
01:32:31.590 --> 01:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
was not a choice it's who i am i have
 
01:32:33.110 --> 01:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
learned to deal with it and i'm so
 
01:32:35.030 --> 01:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
fortunate that i've been completely
 
01:32:38.310 --> 01:32:38.320 align:start position:0%
accepted by my family friends in school
 
01:32:40.310 --> 01:32:40.320 align:start position:0%
i do all of my studies play on the
 
01:32:42.149 --> 01:32:42.159 align:start position:0%
soccer team and am involved in my
 
01:32:42.159 --> 01:32:43.350 align:start position:0%
soccer team and am involved in my
community

01:32:43.350 --> 01:32:43.360 align:start position:0%
community
 
01:32:44.629 --> 01:32:44.639 align:start position:0%
please don't make it harder for
 
01:32:46.629 --> 01:32:46.639 align:start position:0%
teenagers like me the current process
 
01:32:48.629 --> 01:32:48.639 align:start position:0%
causes unnecessary pain and is
 
01:32:51.350 --> 01:32:51.360 align:start position:0%
humiliating i don't think you would want
 
01:32:53.189 --> 01:32:53.199 align:start position:0%
your kids to go through this thank you
 
01:32:54.950 --> 01:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
for your time
 
01:32:58.310 --> 01:32:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:05.030 --> 01:33:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:06.149 --> 01:33:06.159 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
01:33:06.159 --> 01:33:06.830 align:start position:0%
good morning
good

01:33:06.830 --> 01:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
good
 
01:33:09.350 --> 01:33:09.360 align:start position:0%
morning uh
 
01:33:11.669 --> 01:33:11.679 align:start position:0%
chair members of the committee i'm
 
01:33:14.149 --> 01:33:14.159 align:start position:0%
speaking to you this morning as another
 
01:33:16.790 --> 01:33:16.800 align:start position:0%
mother of a transgender person
 
01:33:19.750 --> 01:33:19.760 align:start position:0%
except that this time we actually went
 
01:33:22.870 --> 01:33:22.880 align:start position:0%
through the current process to change
 
01:33:25.110 --> 01:33:25.120 align:start position:0%
our daughter's birth certificate
 
01:33:27.430 --> 01:33:27.440 align:start position:0%
and i'm here to tell you that it was
 
01:33:29.510 --> 01:33:29.520 align:start position:0%
horribly difficult
 
01:33:31.910 --> 01:33:31.920 align:start position:0%
i sent you an email to this effect dated
 
01:33:34.950 --> 01:33:34.960 align:start position:0%
february 25th and so i uh
 
01:33:36.550 --> 01:33:36.560 align:start position:0%
i hope that that is in your record and
 
01:33:38.070 --> 01:33:38.080 align:start position:0%
you will take a look at that for the
 
01:33:38.080 --> 01:33:39.590 align:start position:0%
you will take a look at that for the
details

01:33:39.590 --> 01:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
details
 
01:33:41.590 --> 01:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
but you know i am a new hampshire
 
01:33:43.430 --> 01:33:43.440 align:start position:0%
licensed attorney
 
01:33:46.070 --> 01:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
and i was challenged with this process
 
01:33:50.149 --> 01:33:50.159 align:start position:0%
it was very onerous my husband myself
 
01:33:53.430 --> 01:33:53.440 align:start position:0%
and my daughter needed to leave work and
 
01:33:56.149 --> 01:33:56.159 align:start position:0%
leave school to go to the courthouse
 
01:33:58.470 --> 01:33:58.480 align:start position:0%
this was before the pandemic
 
01:33:59.990 --> 01:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
um we
 
01:34:03.669 --> 01:34:03.679 align:start position:0%
had to manage our daughters and our own
 
01:34:06.790 --> 01:34:06.800 align:start position:0%
emotions as we sat in front of a judge
 
01:34:09.990 --> 01:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
who grilled us and
 
01:34:12.629 --> 01:34:12.639 align:start position:0%
appeared that perhaps the change would
 
01:34:14.310 --> 01:34:14.320 align:start position:0%
not be granted
 
01:34:16.870 --> 01:34:16.880 align:start position:0%
we had to pay a hundred and ten dollar
 
01:34:20.709 --> 01:34:20.719 align:start position:0%
filing fee uh to go through this process
 
01:34:24.390 --> 01:34:24.400 align:start position:0%
and so our family is strongly in favor
 
01:34:28.149 --> 01:34:28.159 align:start position:0%
of this bill we hope that you will uh
 
01:34:31.030 --> 01:34:31.040 align:start position:0%
vote otp on this bill and i welcome any
 
01:34:31.040 --> 01:34:35.910 align:start position:0%
vote otp on this bill and i welcome any
questions

01:34:35.910 --> 01:34:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:38.470 --> 01:34:38.480 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
01:34:42.149 --> 01:34:42.159 align:start position:0%
thank you the chairman calls
 
01:34:44.070 --> 01:34:44.080 align:start position:0%
i read it as valen
 
01:34:44.080 --> 01:34:57.990 align:start position:0%
i read it as valen
werner

01:34:57.990 --> 01:34:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:59.430 --> 01:34:59.440 align:start position:0%
hello can you hear me
 
01:34:59.440 --> 01:35:01.590 align:start position:0%
hello can you hear me
yes

01:35:01.590 --> 01:35:01.600 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:35:03.350 --> 01:35:03.360 align:start position:0%
uh good morning um
 
01:35:05.669 --> 01:35:05.679 align:start position:0%
my name is valen werner um i'm here to
 
01:35:09.110 --> 01:35:09.120 align:start position:0%
express my support for hb295
 
01:35:10.870 --> 01:35:10.880 align:start position:0%
um i support this bill because i'm
 
01:35:12.709 --> 01:35:12.719 align:start position:0%
familiar with how difficult it can be to
 
01:35:14.870 --> 01:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
change documents like birth certificates
 
01:35:16.709 --> 01:35:16.719 align:start position:0%
um and i'm hoping my perspective on what
 
01:35:18.229 --> 01:35:18.239 align:start position:0%
this process is actually like will be
 
01:35:19.910 --> 01:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
useful to the committee
 
01:35:22.470 --> 01:35:22.480 align:start position:0%
um i was born in pennsylvania and since
 
01:35:23.990 --> 01:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
last summer i've been going through the
 
01:35:25.669 --> 01:35:25.679 align:start position:0%
process of changing the gender marker on
 
01:35:27.750 --> 01:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
my birth certificate which was completed
 
01:35:29.590 --> 01:35:29.600 align:start position:0%
just a few days ago
 
01:35:30.950 --> 01:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
pennsylvania and new hampshire have
 
01:35:32.629 --> 01:35:32.639 align:start position:0%
different processes but their processes
 
01:35:34.470 --> 01:35:34.480 align:start position:0%
have similar weaknesses
 
01:35:36.070 --> 01:35:36.080 align:start position:0%
to change someone's gender on the birth
 
01:35:38.070 --> 01:35:38.080 align:start position:0%
record pennsylvania requires a doctor to
 
01:35:39.990 --> 01:35:40.000 align:start position:0%
write a letter stating that person has
 
01:35:41.669 --> 01:35:41.679 align:start position:0%
had appropriate clinical treatment for
 
01:35:43.270 --> 01:35:43.280 align:start position:0%
gender transition
 
01:35:44.950 --> 01:35:44.960 align:start position:0%
like new hampshire's current requirement
 
01:35:47.430 --> 01:35:47.440 align:start position:0%
of a court order indicating a sex change
 
01:35:49.270 --> 01:35:49.280 align:start position:0%
this forces transgender people who want
 
01:35:50.870 --> 01:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
to update their birth certificate to
 
01:35:52.950 --> 01:35:52.960 align:start position:0%
rely on another individual to decide
 
01:35:54.709 --> 01:35:54.719 align:start position:0%
whether they've undergone enough medical
 
01:35:56.790 --> 01:35:56.800 align:start position:0%
treatment to correct their documents
 
01:35:58.709 --> 01:35:58.719 align:start position:0%
the first two doctors i approached about
 
01:36:01.030 --> 01:36:01.040 align:start position:0%
writing a letter refused to do so
 
01:36:02.550 --> 01:36:02.560 align:start position:0%
because even though i had been
 
01:36:04.390 --> 01:36:04.400 align:start position:0%
identifying and living full-time as a
 
01:36:06.470 --> 01:36:06.480 align:start position:0%
man for three years at the time they
 
01:36:08.229 --> 01:36:08.239 align:start position:0%
weren't sure what the state meant by
 
01:36:09.669 --> 01:36:09.679 align:start position:0%
appropriate clinical treatment for
 
01:36:11.830 --> 01:36:11.840 align:start position:0%
gender transition so they did not want
 
01:36:13.669 --> 01:36:13.679 align:start position:0%
to state whether i'd had it
 
01:36:15.590 --> 01:36:15.600 align:start position:0%
both of the first two doctors told me
 
01:36:17.030 --> 01:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
they were willing to write that my
 
01:36:19.270 --> 01:36:19.280 align:start position:0%
gender identity was male but not to
 
01:36:20.550 --> 01:36:20.560 align:start position:0%
declare that i had done enough to
 
01:36:20.560 --> 01:36:21.590 align:start position:0%
declare that i had done enough to
transition

01:36:21.590 --> 01:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
transition
 
01:36:23.350 --> 01:36:23.360 align:start position:0%
and i believe i was lucky that i was
 
01:36:25.669 --> 01:36:25.679 align:start position:0%
able to find a third doctor who agreed
 
01:36:26.950 --> 01:36:26.960 align:start position:0%
that my birth certificate should be
 
01:36:26.960 --> 01:36:27.990 align:start position:0%
that my birth certificate should be
changed

01:36:27.990 --> 01:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
changed
 
01:36:29.910 --> 01:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
this bill would allow people born in new
 
01:36:31.669 --> 01:36:31.679 align:start position:0%
hampshire to avoid problems like the one
 
01:36:32.629 --> 01:36:32.639 align:start position:0%
i had
 
01:36:34.790 --> 01:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
after having treated me as their patient
 
01:36:36.229 --> 01:36:36.239 align:start position:0%
any of my doctors would have been
 
01:36:38.709 --> 01:36:38.719 align:start position:0%
willing to affirm that i am a man and
 
01:36:40.629 --> 01:36:40.639 align:start position:0%
could be reasonably expected to be a man
 
01:36:42.709 --> 01:36:42.719 align:start position:0%
for the foreseeable future it was clear
 
01:36:44.950 --> 01:36:44.960 align:start position:0%
to them as medical professionals and
 
01:36:46.310 --> 01:36:46.320 align:start position:0%
according to this bill that would have
 
01:36:47.830 --> 01:36:47.840 align:start position:0%
been enough
 
01:36:49.669 --> 01:36:49.679 align:start position:0%
the one characteristic all transgender
 
01:36:51.510 --> 01:36:51.520 align:start position:0%
people have in common is that our gender
 
01:36:52.790 --> 01:36:52.800 align:start position:0%
is different from the one we were
 
01:36:55.109 --> 01:36:55.119 align:start position:0%
assigned at birth so it makes sense that
 
01:36:56.790 --> 01:36:56.800 align:start position:0%
this should be the basis for updating
 
01:36:58.070 --> 01:36:58.080 align:start position:0%
our documents
 
01:37:00.149 --> 01:37:00.159 align:start position:0%
requiring that an individual prove
 
01:37:02.709 --> 01:37:02.719 align:start position:0%
anything beyond that ultimately leads to
 
01:37:04.790 --> 01:37:04.800 align:start position:0%
unequal circumstances for people who
 
01:37:07.270 --> 01:37:07.280 align:start position:0%
have difficulty accessing courts or
 
01:37:08.629 --> 01:37:08.639 align:start position:0%
whatever medical care meets the
 
01:37:11.189 --> 01:37:11.199 align:start position:0%
definition of a sex change and so it
 
01:37:13.030 --> 01:37:13.040 align:start position:0%
prevents people with a legitimate need
 
01:37:15.430 --> 01:37:15.440 align:start position:0%
to amend their records from doing so
 
01:37:17.189 --> 01:37:17.199 align:start position:0%
it also allows for discrimination
 
01:37:19.030 --> 01:37:19.040 align:start position:0%
against transgender people by leaving it
 
01:37:20.550 --> 01:37:20.560 align:start position:0%
up to a judge who may not have the

01:38:42.229 --> 01:38:42.239 align:start position:0%
for four years i've been in this room
 
01:38:44.390 --> 01:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
and never realized those windows are
 
01:38:46.070 --> 01:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
different sizes
 
01:38:47.830 --> 01:38:47.840 align:start position:0%
those are big and these are little when
 
01:38:51.430 --> 01:38:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:53.750 --> 01:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
can you hear me those windows
 
01:39:00.550 --> 01:39:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:17.430 --> 01:39:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:36.470 --> 01:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:36.480 --> 01:39:57.910 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:39:57.910 --> 01:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:57.920 --> 01:41:28.870 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:41:28.870 --> 01:41:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:30.870 --> 01:41:30.880 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to thank whichever of the
 
01:41:33.430 --> 01:41:33.440 align:start position:0%
hosts rescued me from the attendee list
 
01:41:36.629 --> 01:41:36.639 align:start position:0%
i actually used the proper link
 
01:41:40.870 --> 01:41:40.880 align:start position:0%
but apparently it's only usable once so
 
01:41:43.189 --> 01:41:43.199 align:start position:0%
if i vanish again i will
 
01:41:45.430 --> 01:41:45.440 align:start position:0%
join via the attendee list and somebody
 
01:41:52.390 --> 01:41:52.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:54.149 --> 01:41:54.159 align:start position:0%

we also have a back-up plan if we lose
 
01:41:58.880 --> 01:42:09.350 align:start position:0%
we also have a back-up plan if we lose
our

01:42:09.350 --> 01:42:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:12.470 --> 01:42:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:15.510 --> 01:42:15.520 align:start position:0%
always nice to have duplicate systems in
 
01:42:15.520 --> 01:42:31.669 align:start position:0%
always nice to have duplicate systems in
place

01:42:31.669 --> 01:42:31.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:31.679 --> 01:42:32.629 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:42:32.629 --> 01:42:32.639 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:42:32.639 --> 01:42:52.470 align:start position:0%
okay

01:42:52.470 --> 01:42:52.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:52.480 --> 01:43:05.510 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:43:05.510 --> 01:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:06.950 --> 01:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
you know lucy your comment about
 
01:43:08.629 --> 01:43:08.639 align:start position:0%
duplicate systems applied in the
 
01:43:11.030 --> 01:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
operating room too
 
01:43:12.870 --> 01:43:12.880 align:start position:0%
you always wanted to have two prosthesis
 
01:43:15.830 --> 01:43:15.840 align:start position:0%
one to drop on the floor and one to use
 
01:43:17.669 --> 01:43:17.679 align:start position:0%
right bill
 
01:43:27.030 --> 01:43:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:29.270 --> 01:43:29.280 align:start position:0%
can't hear you real well
 
01:43:31.669 --> 01:43:31.679 align:start position:0%
what's that i remember once when i was a
 
01:43:33.990 --> 01:43:34.000 align:start position:0%
resident i was assisting a pediatric
 
01:43:36.310 --> 01:43:36.320 align:start position:0%
ophthalmologist and a cataract i think i
 
01:43:39.030 --> 01:43:39.040 align:start position:0%
was a beginning second-year resident and
 
01:43:40.950 --> 01:43:40.960 align:start position:0%
he suddenly passed out and was lying on
 
01:43:42.629 --> 01:43:42.639 align:start position:0%
the floor
 
01:43:46.310 --> 01:43:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:48.149 --> 01:43:48.159 align:start position:0%
redundancy yeah
 
01:43:49.990 --> 01:43:50.000 align:start position:0%
nothing like being thrown in off the
 
01:43:54.870 --> 01:43:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:56.550 --> 01:43:56.560 align:start position:0%
talk about picking things up off the
 
01:43:58.870 --> 01:43:58.880 align:start position:0%
floor we had a gal come in with a
 
01:44:00.629 --> 01:44:00.639 align:start position:0%
motorcycle accident which left her
 
01:44:03.189 --> 01:44:03.199 align:start position:0%
kneecap on the pavement
 
01:44:06.470 --> 01:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
judiciously cleaned it up sterilized it
 
01:44:08.070 --> 01:44:08.080 align:start position:0%
put it in this
 
01:44:10.310 --> 01:44:10.320 align:start position:0%
and she did fine
 
01:44:10.320 --> 01:44:11.030 align:start position:0%
and she did fine
so

01:44:11.030 --> 01:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:44:18.070 --> 01:44:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:19.590 --> 01:44:19.600 align:start position:0%
yeah and you always hated when you
 
01:44:21.109 --> 01:44:21.119 align:start position:0%
dropped the bone graft on the floor that
 
01:44:22.950 --> 01:44:22.960 align:start position:0%
was a bad one too
 
01:44:25.910 --> 01:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
oh unfortunately i never did that
 
01:44:29.270 --> 01:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:31.590 --> 01:44:31.600 align:start position:0%
you're a structural graft too
 
01:44:33.990 --> 01:44:34.000 align:start position:0%
not little chips
 
01:44:35.910 --> 01:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
okay the chair
 
01:44:40.149 --> 01:44:40.159 align:start position:0%
starts the hearing on house bill 502
 
01:44:42.470 --> 01:44:42.480 align:start position:0%
establishing a committee to study
 
01:44:44.229 --> 01:44:44.239 align:start position:0%
whether adequate funds are being set
 
01:44:47.030 --> 01:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
aside from the tobacco fund for youth
 
01:44:49.430 --> 01:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
and young adult prevention
 
01:44:51.109 --> 01:44:51.119 align:start position:0%

help oh yeah to help preserve long-term
 
01:44:55.750 --> 01:44:55.760 align:start position:0%

01:48:01.990 --> 01:48:02.000 align:start position:0%
given in new hampshire there has been a
 
01:48:05.510 --> 01:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
rapid increase in the ends we call it
 
01:48:07.750 --> 01:48:07.760 align:start position:0%
electronic nicotine delivery system or
 
01:48:10.470 --> 01:48:10.480 align:start position:0%
e-cigarette products um
 
01:48:12.470 --> 01:48:12.480 align:start position:0%
for our general consumption that's the
 
01:48:14.629 --> 01:48:14.639 align:start position:0%
e-cigarettes that's how they are defined
 
01:48:16.550 --> 01:48:16.560 align:start position:0%
especially among our high school aged
 
01:48:16.560 --> 01:48:17.590 align:start position:0%
especially among our high school aged
youth

01:48:17.590 --> 01:48:17.600 align:start position:0%
youth
 
01:48:19.430 --> 01:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
which is a great concern not just only
 
01:48:22.070 --> 01:48:22.080 align:start position:0%
for us uh in the department but across
 
01:48:24.870 --> 01:48:24.880 align:start position:0%
our many of our stakeholders as well as
 
01:48:27.669 --> 01:48:27.679 align:start position:0%
from our legislative members too
 
01:48:30.790 --> 01:48:30.800 align:start position:0%
what we have seen is in the last 2019
 
01:48:33.270 --> 01:48:33.280 align:start position:0%
new hampshire youth risk behavior survey
 
01:48:35.830 --> 01:48:35.840 align:start position:0%
we had a high school age youth reporting
 
01:48:38.229 --> 01:48:38.239 align:start position:0%
current use of electronic cigarettes
 
01:48:41.030 --> 01:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
almost around 34 percent and if you
 
01:48:43.270 --> 01:48:43.280 align:start position:0%
compare with the nash nationwide it's
 
01:48:45.669 --> 01:48:45.679 align:start position:0%
only 27 percent
 
01:48:48.709 --> 01:48:48.719 align:start position:0%
so that's a big uh big number to think
 
01:48:51.590 --> 01:48:51.600 align:start position:0%
about and what we also have seen is that
 
01:48:53.270 --> 01:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
the many of the studies have been
 
01:48:55.430 --> 01:48:55.440 align:start position:0%
showing that the flavored e-cigarettes
 
01:48:57.669 --> 01:48:57.679 align:start position:0%
actually has fueled this epidemic or
 
01:49:01.030 --> 01:49:01.040 align:start position:0%
this this this kind of um uh increase
 
01:49:03.350 --> 01:49:03.360 align:start position:0%
because when we found like 90 percent of
 
01:49:06.390 --> 01:49:06.400 align:start position:0%
youth e-cigarette users actually report
 
01:49:10.470 --> 01:49:10.480 align:start position:0%
using a flavored product and 75 70 of
 
01:49:13.030 --> 01:49:13.040 align:start position:0%
them actually cite flavors as the reason
 
01:49:16.149 --> 01:49:16.159 align:start position:0%
for their use so not many know about
 
01:49:18.550 --> 01:49:18.560 align:start position:0%
that there's a tobacco component in
 
01:49:20.870 --> 01:49:20.880 align:start position:0%
these flavors too so that's a bigger
 
01:49:22.070 --> 01:49:22.080 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
01:49:23.590 --> 01:49:23.600 align:start position:0%
concern for us
 
01:49:25.750 --> 01:49:25.760 align:start position:0%
so two areas that the department has
 
01:49:28.709 --> 01:49:28.719 align:start position:0%
focused on supporting the youth programs
 
01:49:30.870 --> 01:49:30.880 align:start position:0%
is on youth engagement
 
01:49:33.430 --> 01:49:33.440 align:start position:0%
uh we feel that youth are critical in
 
01:49:33.440 --> 01:49:34.390 align:start position:0%
uh we feel that youth are critical in
this

01:49:34.390 --> 01:49:34.400 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:49:36.149 --> 01:49:36.159 align:start position:0%
in the public health uh prevention
 
01:49:38.790 --> 01:49:38.800 align:start position:0%
strategies they offer us like you know
 
01:49:41.270 --> 01:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
as we all know they are they have a
 
01:49:44.149 --> 01:49:44.159 align:start position:0%
different take on things from social
 
01:49:45.430 --> 01:49:45.440 align:start position:0%
media to
 
01:49:47.990 --> 01:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
um what areas they want to hear the
 
01:49:49.830 --> 01:49:49.840 align:start position:0%
messaging how they want to hear the
 
01:49:52.070 --> 01:49:52.080 align:start position:0%
messaging about the prevention
 
01:49:54.790 --> 01:49:54.800 align:start position:0%
so we actually work with our um
 
01:49:56.950 --> 01:49:56.960 align:start position:0%
we act our provider our tobacco
 
01:49:59.270 --> 01:49:59.280 align:start position:0%
prevention association program actually
 
01:50:00.870 --> 01:50:00.880 align:start position:0%
engaged youth
 
01:50:03.669 --> 01:50:03.679 align:start position:0%
in uh youth groups in this uh focus on
 
01:50:05.270 --> 01:50:05.280 align:start position:0%
understanding what are the strategies
 
01:50:07.510 --> 01:50:07.520 align:start position:0%
that we need to talk about how do we
 
01:50:10.629 --> 01:50:10.639 align:start position:0%
want to provide um those prevention and
 
01:50:12.550 --> 01:50:12.560 align:start position:0%
intervention campaigns
 
01:50:12.560 --> 01:50:14.070 align:start position:0%
intervention campaigns
so

01:50:14.070 --> 01:50:14.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:50:16.950 --> 01:50:16.960 align:start position:0%
with that in mind we actually in the
 
01:50:19.830 --> 01:50:19.840 align:start position:0%
state fiscal 20 and 21 we actually
 
01:50:22.470 --> 01:50:22.480 align:start position:0%
launched a multi-platform prevention
 
01:50:24.629 --> 01:50:24.639 align:start position:0%
and intervention campaign it's called
 
01:50:26.790 --> 01:50:26.800 align:start position:0%
save your breath new hampshire it's
 
01:50:29.189 --> 01:50:29.199 align:start position:0%
actually you can find it on our uh on a
 
01:50:32.709 --> 01:50:32.719 align:start position:0%
web page on our website uh uh it's save
 
01:50:35.750 --> 01:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
your breath uh new hampshire dot org
 
01:50:39.030 --> 01:50:39.040 align:start position:0%
so this actually was this was this when
 
01:50:41.270 --> 01:50:41.280 align:start position:0%
we with this campaign we actually had
 
01:50:43.590 --> 01:50:43.600 align:start position:0%
around one million engagement
 
01:50:45.750 --> 01:50:45.760 align:start position:0%
uh and impressions so
 
01:50:47.510 --> 01:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
with that information like there were
 
01:50:49.590 --> 01:50:49.600 align:start position:0%
fifty thousand peop fifty thousand kids
 
01:50:51.830 --> 01:50:51.840 align:start position:0%
who are interested to learn about it
 
01:50:54.229 --> 01:50:54.239 align:start position:0%
this website actually provided a lot of
 
01:50:57.669 --> 01:50:57.679 align:start position:0%
information on what kind of um info
 
01:50:59.350 --> 01:50:59.360 align:start position:0%
specifically educational kind of
 
01:51:01.590 --> 01:51:01.600 align:start position:0%
information like what does wave means
 
01:51:03.590 --> 01:51:03.600 align:start position:0%
what kind of uh products go into that
 
01:51:05.750 --> 01:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
vape and all that so that's one of the
 
01:51:07.750 --> 01:51:07.760 align:start position:0%
area that we've worked on
 
01:51:10.149 --> 01:51:10.159 align:start position:0%
the second area that we actually came
 
01:51:12.790 --> 01:51:12.800 align:start position:0%

01:51:22.229 --> 01:51:22.239 align:start position:0%
focused on adults 18 and over the my
 
01:51:24.070 --> 01:51:24.080 align:start position:0%

01:54:18.709 --> 01:54:18.719 align:start position:0%
elderly houses
 
01:54:23.430 --> 01:54:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:25.750 --> 01:54:25.760 align:start position:0%
i've got an elderly house question for
 
01:54:25.760 --> 01:54:27.350 align:start position:0%
i've got an elderly house question for
you

01:54:27.350 --> 01:54:27.360 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:54:27.360 --> 01:54:29.030 align:start position:0%
you
i

01:54:29.030 --> 01:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:54:31.990 --> 01:54:32.000 align:start position:0%
the last floor that i finished our house
 
01:54:35.189 --> 01:54:35.199 align:start position:0%
is over 200 years old so the last floor
 
01:54:38.149 --> 01:54:38.159 align:start position:0%
i finished they had already painted once
 
01:54:40.550 --> 01:54:40.560 align:start position:0%
so i just repaint it and i filled all
 
01:54:43.030 --> 01:54:43.040 align:start position:0%
the gaps between the big pine
 
01:54:45.189 --> 01:54:45.199 align:start position:0%
things with with caulk and then painted
 
01:54:46.310 --> 01:54:46.320 align:start position:0%
over it
 
01:54:49.510 --> 01:54:49.520 align:start position:0%
but there's some that i want to refinish
 
01:54:51.910 --> 01:54:51.920 align:start position:0%
and what do you fill those gaps with
 
01:54:54.950 --> 01:54:54.960 align:start position:0%
where all that whatever they use the
 
01:54:57.430 --> 01:54:57.440 align:start position:0%
granule stuff they use to clock those
 
01:55:01.589 --> 01:55:01.599 align:start position:0%
fine flooring how do you where do you
 
01:55:02.870 --> 01:55:02.880 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to figure out how to fill
 
01:55:05.589 --> 01:55:05.599 align:start position:0%
that so that it doesn't look like it's
 
01:55:07.990 --> 01:55:08.000 align:start position:0%
caulk when i
 
01:55:09.910 --> 01:55:09.920 align:start position:0%
restain the floors
 
01:55:13.350 --> 01:55:13.360 align:start position:0%
oh a floor fill floors yeah
 
01:55:15.430 --> 01:55:15.440 align:start position:0%
that's hard
 
01:55:17.189 --> 01:55:17.199 align:start position:0%
that's kind of above my pay grade but i
 
01:55:19.669 --> 01:55:19.679 align:start position:0%
would say one thing to be careful about
 
01:55:21.109 --> 01:55:21.119 align:start position:0%
if you're going to refinish which i
 
01:55:23.830 --> 01:55:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:25.109 --> 01:55:25.119 align:start position:0%
some of the
 
01:55:27.350 --> 01:55:27.360 align:start position:0%
floor finishes even if not paint may
 
01:55:29.589 --> 01:55:29.599 align:start position:0%
have possibly contained lead
 
01:55:30.950 --> 01:55:30.960 align:start position:0%
yeah we
 
01:55:33.109 --> 01:55:33.119 align:start position:0%
i mean even when i was washing the
 
01:55:36.790 --> 01:55:36.800 align:start position:0%
outside windows i wore gloves and i
 
01:55:39.189 --> 01:55:39.199 align:start position:0%
washed everything when i was done
 
01:55:41.910 --> 01:55:41.920 align:start position:0%
because we assumed there was paint
 
01:55:45.030 --> 01:55:45.040 align:start position:0%
right painted in the trim so yeah no
 
01:55:45.040 --> 01:55:46.470 align:start position:0%
right painted in the trim so yeah no
we're

01:55:46.470 --> 01:55:46.480 align:start position:0%
we're
 
01:55:48.390 --> 01:55:48.400 align:start position:0%
we've been very careful with some things
 
01:55:50.550 --> 01:55:50.560 align:start position:0%
that we've found in this house
 
01:55:52.950 --> 01:55:52.960 align:start position:0%
yeah they can do some really really cool
 
01:55:55.669 --> 01:55:55.679 align:start position:0%
spectroscopy uh to determine if there's
 
01:55:57.990 --> 01:55:58.000 align:start position:0%
lead in the layers of paint or finish
 
01:55:58.000 --> 01:55:59.669 align:start position:0%
lead in the layers of paint or finish
below

01:55:59.669 --> 01:55:59.679 align:start position:0%
below
 
01:56:02.310 --> 01:56:02.320 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah the walls had very little
 
01:56:04.390 --> 01:56:04.400 align:start position:0%
paint they had
 
01:56:08.149 --> 01:56:08.159 align:start position:0%
three four layers of wallpaper
 
01:56:09.669 --> 01:56:09.679 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah
 
01:56:11.830 --> 01:56:11.840 align:start position:0%
can you hear us now
 
01:56:11.840 --> 01:56:14.470 align:start position:0%
can you hear us now
yes

01:56:14.470 --> 01:56:14.480 align:start position:0%

we're going to uh recess the bill on
 
01:56:16.880 --> 01:56:20.629 align:start position:0%
we're going to uh recess the bill on
wallpaper

01:56:20.629 --> 01:56:20.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:23.510 --> 01:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
we didn't come to a vote come on
 
01:56:25.910 --> 01:56:25.920 align:start position:0%

thank you all again uh do you want me to
 
01:56:58.229 --> 01:56:58.239 align:start position:0%
begin from the uh uh
 
01:56:59.750 --> 01:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
the whole thing
 
01:57:02.149 --> 01:57:02.159 align:start position:0%
no how about halfway through okay thank
 
01:57:04.950 --> 01:57:04.960 align:start position:0%
you um so just to focus on two main
 
01:57:06.629 --> 01:57:06.639 align:start position:0%
things that the department has been
 
01:57:09.510 --> 01:57:09.520 align:start position:0%
working on are youth engagement where we
 
01:57:11.750 --> 01:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
have established savior breath new
 
01:57:13.830 --> 01:57:13.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire dot
 
01:57:16.149 --> 01:57:16.159 align:start position:0%
campaign so where we provide a lot of
 
01:57:18.790 --> 01:57:18.800 align:start position:0%
information on different fresh
 
01:57:21.830 --> 01:57:21.840 align:start position:0%
fresh perspectives to about vaping and
 
01:57:21.840 --> 01:57:22.950 align:start position:0%
fresh perspectives to about vaping and
why

01:57:22.950 --> 01:57:22.960 align:start position:0%
why
 
01:57:24.390 --> 01:57:24.400 align:start position:0%
what the what those public health
 
01:57:26.709 --> 01:57:26.719 align:start position:0%
prevention strategies are for the youth
 
01:57:28.790 --> 01:57:28.800 align:start position:0%
uh during last um
 
01:57:30.310 --> 01:57:30.320 align:start position:0%
we have started this campaign in the
 
01:57:33.510 --> 01:57:33.520 align:start position:0%
state fiscal 20 and 21 we had around 1
 
01:57:36.070 --> 01:57:36.080 align:start position:0%
million engagement and impressions uh so
 
01:57:38.709 --> 01:57:38.719 align:start position:0%
basically that's um i'm not the social
 
01:57:41.030 --> 01:57:41.040 align:start position:0%
media expert but my understanding is
 
01:57:43.350 --> 01:57:43.360 align:start position:0%
that one million engagement is uh people
 
01:57:45.270 --> 01:57:45.280 align:start position:0%
who visited website pull some
 
01:57:47.270 --> 01:57:47.280 align:start position:0%
information to understand those things
 
01:57:49.510 --> 01:57:49.520 align:start position:0%
or clicked on the information to get
 
01:57:51.910 --> 01:57:51.920 align:start position:0%
more details and all that kind of thing
 
01:57:54.070 --> 01:57:54.080 align:start position:0%
we are planning to actually expand this
 
01:57:57.589 --> 01:57:57.599 align:start position:0%
further um to use this information to um
 
01:57:59.350 --> 01:57:59.360 align:start position:0%
like a phase two kind of thing to
 
01:58:01.350 --> 01:58:01.360 align:start position:0%
continue working with our
 
01:58:03.750 --> 01:58:03.760 align:start position:0%
youth population to understand
 
01:58:06.229 --> 01:58:06.239 align:start position:0%
how can we use this approach to include
 
01:58:08.310 --> 01:58:08.320 align:start position:0%
the middle and junior high school aged
 
01:58:10.470 --> 01:58:10.480 align:start position:0%
youth in increasing the education on
 
01:58:12.870 --> 01:58:12.880 align:start position:0%
electronic cigarettes the second piece
 
01:58:15.589 --> 01:58:15.599 align:start position:0%
that we have started is the my life my
 
01:58:17.669 --> 01:58:17.679 align:start position:0%
quit again this is a youth tobacco
 
01:58:21.589 --> 01:58:21.599 align:start position:0%
cessation uh focused um
 
01:58:24.709 --> 01:58:24.719 align:start position:0%
area that we are providing or what you
 
01:58:27.030 --> 01:58:27.040 align:start position:0%
call has um it's almost like similar to
 
01:58:29.030 --> 01:58:29.040 align:start position:0%
the quitline program that's we offer for
 
01:58:31.830 --> 01:58:31.840 align:start position:0%
the the adults but this one is very much
 
01:58:35.669 --> 01:58:35.679 align:start position:0%
focused on youth um you uh and uh where
 
01:58:38.629 --> 01:58:38.639 align:start position:0%
we provide the trained coaches they
 
01:58:39.669 --> 01:58:39.679 align:start position:0%
actually provide some of the
 
01:58:41.910 --> 01:58:41.920 align:start position:0%
personalized support uh support for the
 
01:58:43.589 --> 01:58:43.599 align:start position:0%
youth who are interested in quitting
 
01:58:46.390 --> 01:58:46.400 align:start position:0%
vaping or vape products and they provide
 
01:58:47.669 --> 01:58:47.679 align:start position:0%
like you know how to cope with the
 
01:58:49.589 --> 01:58:49.599 align:start position:0%
stress navigate some
 
01:58:51.589 --> 01:58:51.599 align:start position:0%
some stressful situations or peer
 
01:58:54.149 --> 01:58:54.159 align:start position:0%
pressures and even how to build uh
 
01:58:56.070 --> 01:58:56.080 align:start position:0%
relationships that promote promote that
 
01:58:58.550 --> 01:58:58.560 align:start position:0%
kind of a tobacco-free identity
 
01:59:01.030 --> 01:59:01.040 align:start position:0%
and this program is actually is only
 
01:59:03.430 --> 01:59:03.440 align:start position:0%
available in 21 states including new
 
01:59:06.149 --> 01:59:06.159 align:start position:0%
hampshire it's a very um
 
01:59:08.550 --> 01:59:08.560 align:start position:0%
very much tailored to support the youth
 
01:59:10.310 --> 01:59:10.320 align:start position:0%
for the prop prop
 
01:59:11.830 --> 01:59:11.840 align:start position:0%
that population
 
01:59:14.629 --> 01:59:14.639 align:start position:0%
uh again we are we are our future
 
01:59:17.189 --> 01:59:17.199 align:start position:0%
thought is to use this to expand and
 
01:59:19.430 --> 01:59:19.440 align:start position:0%
include our communities especially our
 
01:59:21.830 --> 01:59:21.840 align:start position:0%
school administrations and our school
 
01:59:23.669 --> 01:59:23.679 align:start position:0%
community and superintendent school
 
01:59:25.830 --> 01:59:25.840 align:start position:0%
boards to say like you know how can we
 
01:59:27.990 --> 01:59:28.000 align:start position:0%
use this to support the youth in the
 
01:59:31.189 --> 01:59:31.199 align:start position:0%
school so that we um they don't lose the
 
01:59:34.229 --> 01:59:34.239 align:start position:0%
um they it gives them a support system
 
01:59:36.629 --> 01:59:36.639 align:start position:0%
for for preventing the vaping
 
01:59:36.639 --> 01:59:37.750 align:start position:0%
for for preventing the vaping
um

01:59:37.750 --> 01:59:37.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:40.229 --> 01:59:40.239 align:start position:0%
again we are with one of the biggest
 
01:59:42.870 --> 01:59:42.880 align:start position:0%
stumbling block for us in the last as
 
01:59:44.310 --> 01:59:44.320 align:start position:0%
you all know we are going through the
 
01:59:47.189 --> 01:59:47.199 align:start position:0%
kobe 19 pandemic that limited some of
 
01:59:50.070 --> 01:59:50.080 align:start position:0%
our work in the school systems so
 
01:59:52.470 --> 01:59:52.480 align:start position:0%
that's where we are now currently with
 
01:59:54.790 --> 01:59:54.800 align:start position:0%
uh what we are doing on the youth and we
 
01:59:56.709 --> 01:59:56.719 align:start position:0%
are hoping to expand these activities
 
01:59:59.350 --> 01:59:59.360 align:start position:0%
further in in future and we are working
 
02:00:01.910 --> 02:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
with our our uh behavior health our
 
02:00:04.629 --> 02:00:04.639 align:start position:0%
bureau of drug and alcohol services also
 
02:00:07.189 --> 02:00:07.199 align:start position:0%
to expand those uh in-school activities
 
02:00:10.830 --> 02:00:10.840 align:start position:0%
to support the prevention or preventing
 
02:00:13.430 --> 02:00:13.440 align:start position:0%
vaping you um
 
02:00:15.189 --> 02:00:15.199 align:start position:0%
as you uh
 
02:00:17.669 --> 02:00:17.679 align:start position:0%
expand the program are you putting in
 
02:00:19.270 --> 02:00:19.280 align:start position:0%
for additional funds because that's
 
02:00:21.510 --> 02:00:21.520 align:start position:0%
really what the bill is about is seeing
 
02:00:24.229 --> 02:00:24.239 align:start position:0%
if you have enough money so um could you
 
02:00:27.430 --> 02:00:27.440 align:start position:0%
speak very briefly to as you expand how
 
02:00:29.510 --> 02:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
is your expansion the program getting
 
02:00:29.520 --> 02:00:30.790 align:start position:0%
is your expansion the program getting
funded

02:00:30.790 --> 02:00:30.800 align:start position:0%
funded
 
02:00:34.070 --> 02:00:34.080 align:start position:0%
currently we had um in the last biennium
 
02:00:37.990 --> 02:00:38.000 align:start position:0%
we had uh we had prioritized vaping and
 
02:00:40.709 --> 02:00:40.719 align:start position:0%
we received funds from uh in the in the
 
02:00:43.270 --> 02:00:43.280 align:start position:0%
legislative budget in the in our budget
 
02:00:45.669 --> 02:00:45.679 align:start position:0%
to support those activities and that's
 
02:00:48.149 --> 02:00:48.159 align:start position:0%
up that support is continuing we have
 
02:00:50.070 --> 02:00:50.080 align:start position:0%
identified this as another this helps to
 
02:00:52.790 --> 02:00:52.800 align:start position:0%
fill our priority area for this budget
 
02:00:56.149 --> 02:00:56.159 align:start position:0%
too and uh we are continuing to request
 
02:00:59.189 --> 02:00:59.199 align:start position:0%
more funds to support that activity
 
02:01:01.350 --> 02:01:01.360 align:start position:0%

02:01:25.750 --> 02:01:25.760 align:start position:0%
committees
 
02:01:29.510 --> 02:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
are made up of members of the house only
 
02:01:32.950 --> 02:01:32.960 align:start position:0%
whereas commissions which are often
 
02:01:36.870 --> 02:01:36.880 align:start position:0%
impaneled to study issues can be made up
 
02:01:39.990 --> 02:01:40.000 align:start position:0%
of members of the public as well
 
02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:41.109 align:start position:0%
of members of the public as well
um

02:01:41.109 --> 02:01:41.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:43.990 --> 02:01:44.000 align:start position:0%
it would this be better remanded to a
 
02:01:51.109 --> 02:01:51.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:51.119 --> 02:01:52.550 align:start position:0%
 
uh

02:01:52.550 --> 02:01:52.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:01:53.669 --> 02:01:53.679 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
02:01:56.070 --> 02:01:56.080 align:start position:0%
representatives holloway i don't have
 
02:01:56.080 --> 02:01:57.510 align:start position:0%
representatives holloway i don't have
much

02:01:57.510 --> 02:01:57.520 align:start position:0%
much
 
02:02:00.629 --> 02:02:00.639 align:start position:0%
understanding or i i don't have uh how
 
02:02:03.910 --> 02:02:03.920 align:start position:0%
the commission or committee or different
 
02:02:06.709 --> 02:02:06.719 align:start position:0%
groups work so i don't have the answer
 
02:02:09.430 --> 02:02:09.440 align:start position:0%
for that i refer back to
 
02:02:12.310 --> 02:02:12.320 align:start position:0%
uh the committee for that that that
 
02:02:12.320 --> 02:02:14.390 align:start position:0%
uh the committee for that that that
clarity

02:02:14.390 --> 02:02:14.400 align:start position:0%
clarity
 
02:02:16.790 --> 02:02:16.800 align:start position:0%
uh that puts us both on the same page i
 
02:02:18.709 --> 02:02:18.719 align:start position:0%
was hoping that the committee chair
 
02:02:20.870 --> 02:02:20.880 align:start position:0%
might jump in and answer it for both of
 
02:02:26.229 --> 02:02:26.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:32.229 --> 02:02:32.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:34.550 --> 02:02:34.560 align:start position:0%
my comments are right along the same
 
02:02:37.350 --> 02:02:37.360 align:start position:0%
lines as representative salloway
 
02:02:39.510 --> 02:02:39.520 align:start position:0%
there is an existing
 
02:02:41.270 --> 02:02:41.280 align:start position:0%
commission called the
 
02:02:43.430 --> 02:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
health and human services oversight
 
02:02:43.440 --> 02:02:44.629 align:start position:0%
health and human services oversight
committee

02:02:44.629 --> 02:02:44.639 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:02:48.470 --> 02:02:48.480 align:start position:0%
which purpose is exactly to deal with
 
02:02:49.910 --> 02:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
issues um
 
02:02:51.270 --> 02:02:51.280 align:start position:0%
like this
 
02:02:53.750 --> 02:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
and it came up recently in another piece
 
02:02:55.910 --> 02:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
of legislation because they
 
02:02:58.629 --> 02:02:58.639 align:start position:0%
somewhat cut back on the membership of
 
02:02:58.639 --> 02:03:00.229 align:start position:0%
somewhat cut back on the membership of
that

02:03:00.229 --> 02:03:00.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:03:00.239 --> 02:03:01.430 align:start position:0%
that
committee

02:03:01.430 --> 02:03:01.440 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:03:03.589 --> 02:03:03.599 align:start position:0%
since this is a function
 
02:03:05.750 --> 02:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
of health and human services it doesn't
 
02:03:07.910 --> 02:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
seem to me that this legislation is
 
02:03:07.920 --> 02:03:08.870 align:start position:0%
seem to me that this legislation is
needed

02:03:08.870 --> 02:03:08.880 align:start position:0%
needed
 
02:03:09.990 --> 02:03:10.000 align:start position:0%
at all
 
02:03:11.510 --> 02:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
and that
 
02:03:14.790 --> 02:03:14.800 align:start position:0%
it would simply report to the oversight
 
02:03:16.950 --> 02:03:16.960 align:start position:0%
committee like a whole bunch of other
 
02:03:20.950 --> 02:03:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:24.709 --> 02:03:24.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:29.350 --> 02:03:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:31.350 --> 02:03:31.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and i could speak to
 
02:03:33.350 --> 02:03:33.360 align:start position:0%
the committee versus commission issue
 
02:03:35.270 --> 02:03:35.280 align:start position:0%
but only if you would care to have me do
 
02:03:37.270 --> 02:03:37.280 align:start position:0%
so otherwise i will hold my comments for
 
02:03:38.950 --> 02:03:38.960 align:start position:0%
another time
 
02:03:41.430 --> 02:03:41.440 align:start position:0%
when we have time to burn that would be
 
02:03:43.830 --> 02:03:43.840 align:start position:0%
very instructive
 
02:03:48.229 --> 02:03:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:51.030 --> 02:03:51.040 align:start position:0%
thank you dr psy
 
02:03:52.629 --> 02:03:52.639 align:start position:0%

02:03:54.830 --> 02:03:54.840 align:start position:0%
thank you all thank you so
 
02:03:58.629 --> 02:03:58.639 align:start position:0%
much and as promised
 
02:04:01.270 --> 02:04:01.280 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes nancy vaughn from
 
02:04:03.589 --> 02:04:03.599 align:start position:0%
the american heart association who
 
02:04:05.830 --> 02:04:05.840 align:start position:0%

02:04:05.840 --> 02:04:13.030 align:start position:0%
signed up to testify in fact on this
bill

02:04:13.030 --> 02:04:13.040 align:start position:0%

uh you know giving this bill some
 
02:04:23.910 --> 02:04:23.920 align:start position:0%
consideration um you know
 
02:04:25.830 --> 02:04:25.840 align:start position:0%
for the record i'm nancy von government
 
02:04:27.350 --> 02:04:27.360 align:start position:0%
relations director for the american
 
02:04:29.510 --> 02:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
heart association in new hampshire
 
02:04:31.990 --> 02:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
i did sign on in support of house bill
 
02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:33.430 align:start position:0%
i did sign on in support of house bill
502

02:04:33.430 --> 02:04:33.440 align:start position:0%
502
 
02:04:36.229 --> 02:04:36.239 align:start position:0%
but i don't have any specific
 
02:04:37.830 --> 02:04:37.840 align:start position:0%
suggestion that it be a committee a
 
02:04:40.629 --> 02:04:40.639 align:start position:0%
commission or be handed off to another
 
02:04:43.109 --> 02:04:43.119 align:start position:0%
already established group um to talk
 
02:04:44.470 --> 02:04:44.480 align:start position:0%
about but i just
 
02:04:48.149 --> 02:04:48.159 align:start position:0%
urge um that this issue be talked about
 
02:04:51.589 --> 02:04:51.599 align:start position:0%
and to find a way to um to fund uh this
 
02:04:54.550 --> 02:04:54.560 align:start position:0%
really important tobacco program um the
 
02:04:57.750 --> 02:04:57.760 align:start position:0%
uh dr terello went into great detail on
 
02:04:59.589 --> 02:04:59.599 align:start position:0%
on what it is that they would like to
 
02:04:59.599 --> 02:05:00.629 align:start position:0%
on what it is that they would like to
accomplish

02:05:00.629 --> 02:05:00.639 align:start position:0%
accomplish
 
02:05:03.189 --> 02:05:03.199 align:start position:0%
this year um into next year
 
02:05:05.030 --> 02:05:05.040 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:05:06.870 --> 02:05:06.880 align:start position:0%
and then even beyond that there there is
 
02:05:10.550 --> 02:05:10.560 align:start position:0%
a need for um a tobacco control program
 
02:05:13.109 --> 02:05:13.119 align:start position:0%
um these are our programs that really
 
02:05:14.390 --> 02:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
can have a
 
02:05:18.390 --> 02:05:18.400 align:start position:0%
vast impact on reducing youth tobacco
 
02:05:21.109 --> 02:05:21.119 align:start position:0%
use and tobacco includes electronic
 
02:05:23.109 --> 02:05:23.119 align:start position:0%
products it also includes new and
 
02:05:25.189 --> 02:05:25.199 align:start position:0%
emerging products such as the heat not
 
02:05:27.430 --> 02:05:27.440 align:start position:0%
burn there are always new products
 
02:05:30.709 --> 02:05:30.719 align:start position:0%
coming out from the industry so
 
02:05:33.350 --> 02:05:33.360 align:start position:0%
you know looking at this 10 years ago 15
 
02:05:35.270 --> 02:05:35.280 align:start position:0%
years ago it's a different world right
 
02:05:35.280 --> 02:05:36.310 align:start position:0%
years ago it's a different world right
now

02:05:36.310 --> 02:05:36.320 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:05:39.189 --> 02:05:39.199 align:start position:0%
that needs to be looked at and funding
 
02:05:41.669 --> 02:05:41.679 align:start position:0%
found now the american heart association
 
02:05:43.750 --> 02:05:43.760 align:start position:0%
you know looks at the cdc for their
 
02:05:45.510 --> 02:05:45.520 align:start position:0%
recommendations on what state should be
 
02:05:48.390 --> 02:05:48.400 align:start position:0%
spending and for new hampshire it's um a
 
02:05:51.750 --> 02:05:51.760 align:start position:0%
whopping 16.5 million dollars annually
 
02:05:53.669 --> 02:05:53.679 align:start position:0%
which we have not come close to in the
 
02:05:56.390 --> 02:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
past the aha would really recommend you
 
02:05:58.870 --> 02:05:58.880 align:start position:0%
know a state starting at at least 15
 
02:06:01.189 --> 02:06:01.199 align:start position:0%
percent of the cdc recommendation for
 
02:06:02.870 --> 02:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
their states for new hampshire that
 
02:06:04.229 --> 02:06:04.239 align:start position:0%
would be approximately two and a half
 
02:06:07.350 --> 02:06:07.360 align:start position:0%
million dollars a year so that we have a
 
02:06:09.510 --> 02:06:09.520 align:start position:0%
ways to go between that and where we're
 
02:06:13.270 --> 02:06:13.280 align:start position:0%
funding right now but i i really do um
 
02:06:16.870 --> 02:06:16.880 align:start position:0%
urge you to um to look into this issue
 
02:06:19.510 --> 02:06:19.520 align:start position:0%
the the state does receive over 240
 
02:06:21.430 --> 02:06:21.440 align:start position:0%
million dollars a year between tobacco
 
02:06:23.990 --> 02:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
taxation and master settlement funding
 
02:06:25.750 --> 02:06:25.760 align:start position:0%
so there are funds there it's just
 
02:06:28.310 --> 02:06:28.320 align:start position:0%
prioritizing taking some of those funds
 
02:06:31.030 --> 02:06:31.040 align:start position:0%
and putting it to helping our kids not
 
02:06:33.990 --> 02:06:34.000 align:start position:0%
start a what could be a lifelong tobacco
 
02:06:36.390 --> 02:06:36.400 align:start position:0%
problem i also
 
02:06:40.069 --> 02:06:40.079 align:start position:0%
also back what doctor trello was saying
 
02:06:40.079 --> 02:06:41.189 align:start position:0%
also back what doctor trello was saying
about

02:06:41.189 --> 02:06:41.199 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:06:41.199 --> 02:06:42.229 align:start position:0%
about
funding

02:06:42.229 --> 02:06:42.239 align:start position:0%
funding
 
02:06:45.030 --> 02:06:45.040 align:start position:0%
in this current uh budget process
 
02:06:47.350 --> 02:06:47.360 align:start position:0%
not only their efficiency budget but
 
02:06:50.390 --> 02:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
also that extra 220 000 per year for
 
02:06:52.149 --> 02:06:52.159 align:start position:0%
this new initiative
 
02:06:55.430 --> 02:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
so again i urge you to pass the bill or
 
02:06:57.350 --> 02:06:57.360 align:start position:0%
amend it in some way that we can
 
02:07:00.069 --> 02:07:00.079 align:start position:0%
continue this conversation um into the
 
02:07:02.229 --> 02:07:02.239 align:start position:0%
near future but not to take too much
 
02:07:03.910 --> 02:07:03.920 align:start position:0%
time to study it
 
02:07:03.920 --> 02:07:05.270 align:start position:0%
time to study it
so

02:07:05.270 --> 02:07:05.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:07:07.350 --> 02:07:07.360 align:start position:0%
yeah since i cheered the oversight
 
02:07:07.360 --> 02:07:08.470 align:start position:0%
yeah since i cheered the oversight
committee

02:07:08.470 --> 02:07:08.480 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:07:10.950 --> 02:07:10.960 align:start position:0%
representative soloway reminded us
 
02:07:10.960 --> 02:07:11.750 align:start position:0%
representative soloway reminded us
um

02:07:11.750 --> 02:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:14.470 --> 02:07:14.480 align:start position:0%
and he's on it as well uh we will be
 
02:07:17.030 --> 02:07:17.040 align:start position:0%
addressing this very issue
 
02:07:18.870 --> 02:07:18.880 align:start position:0%
and you may be
 
02:07:21.030 --> 02:07:21.040 align:start position:0%
happy to learn that
 
02:07:24.830 --> 02:07:24.840 align:start position:0%

house presented me a huge stack of
papers

02:07:28.550 --> 02:07:28.560 align:start position:0%
papers
 
02:07:31.510 --> 02:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
and wanted me to go through it and

02:07:52.470 --> 02:07:52.480 align:start position:0%
committee versus the commission and also
 
02:07:52.480 --> 02:07:53.350 align:start position:0%
committee versus the commission and also
about

02:07:53.350 --> 02:07:53.360 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:07:55.830 --> 02:07:55.840 align:start position:0%
the process of putting this through
 
02:07:57.510 --> 02:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
the oversight committee versus creating
 
02:07:59.990 --> 02:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
another committee itself
 
02:08:01.109 --> 02:08:01.119 align:start position:0%
if it's
 
02:08:03.189 --> 02:08:03.199 align:start position:0%
pretty much the mind of us
 
02:08:05.270 --> 02:08:05.280 align:start position:0%
that this is an important task to be
 
02:08:05.280 --> 02:08:06.149 align:start position:0%
that this is an important task to be
done

02:08:06.149 --> 02:08:06.159 align:start position:0%
done
 
02:08:09.189 --> 02:08:09.199 align:start position:0%
but the task to do it is the oversight
 
02:08:09.199 --> 02:08:10.390 align:start position:0%
but the task to do it is the oversight
committee

02:08:10.390 --> 02:08:10.400 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:08:13.510 --> 02:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
then we can exec the bill unanimously
 
02:08:13.520 --> 02:08:15.430 align:start position:0%
then we can exec the bill unanimously
itl

02:08:15.430 --> 02:08:15.440 align:start position:0%
itl
 
02:08:19.990 --> 02:08:20.000 align:start position:0%
if that's what we all seem to think
 
02:08:22.069 --> 02:08:22.079 align:start position:0%
if there are people who think oh no we
 
02:08:24.629 --> 02:08:24.639 align:start position:0%
really do need a separate committee
 
02:08:24.639 --> 02:08:25.990 align:start position:0%
really do need a separate committee
um

02:08:25.990 --> 02:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:28.229 --> 02:08:28.239 align:start position:0%
then we'll have a longer discussion
 
02:08:32.390 --> 02:08:32.400 align:start position:0%
so this isn't a vote this is a um
 
02:08:33.750 --> 02:08:33.760 align:start position:0%
straw vote
 
02:08:36.870 --> 02:08:36.880 align:start position:0%
if you would like to execute itl and let
 
02:08:39.669 --> 02:08:39.679 align:start position:0%
oversight committee handle this very
 
02:08:41.669 --> 02:08:41.679 align:start position:0%
very legitimate request could you just
 
02:08:46.950 --> 02:08:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:51.510 --> 02:08:51.520 align:start position:0%
all right um yeah um thank you
 
02:08:54.790 --> 02:08:54.800 align:start position:0%
mr chairman to advocate for the funding
 
02:08:56.470 --> 02:08:56.480 align:start position:0%
do we need a bill
 
02:08:58.229 --> 02:08:58.239 align:start position:0%
yeah that's gonna ask thank you
 
02:09:00.229 --> 02:09:00.239 align:start position:0%
we do yeah we don't need
 
02:09:03.189 --> 02:09:03.199 align:start position:0%
a bill to advocate for funding this is
 
02:09:06.069 --> 02:09:06.079 align:start position:0%
this can be done in a couple of ways
 
02:09:08.149 --> 02:09:08.159 align:start position:0%
um all right would somebody like to move
 
02:09:11.830 --> 02:09:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:14.149 --> 02:09:14.159 align:start position:0%
so move mr chairman
 
02:09:14.159 --> 02:09:15.990 align:start position:0%
so move mr chairman

representation
 
02:09:18.390 --> 02:09:18.400 align:start position:0%
we need to enter an executive session
 
02:09:21.830 --> 02:09:21.840 align:start position:0%
first you are correct i close
 
02:09:25.350 --> 02:09:25.360 align:start position:0%

okay
 
02:09:50.709 --> 02:09:50.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:50.719 --> 02:09:52.629 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:09:52.629 --> 02:09:52.639 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:09:55.430 --> 02:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
shapiro before we call the role do you
 
02:09:57.189 --> 02:09:57.199 align:start position:0%
have something
 
02:09:58.629 --> 02:09:58.639 align:start position:0%
to say
 
02:09:58.639 --> 02:09:59.589 align:start position:0%
to say
yes

02:09:59.589 --> 02:09:59.599 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:09:59.599 --> 02:10:00.870 align:start position:0%
yes
um

02:10:00.870 --> 02:10:00.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:02.550 --> 02:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
perhaps it's um
 
02:10:05.270 --> 02:10:05.280 align:start position:0%
because the sponsor of the bill didn't
 
02:10:06.870 --> 02:10:06.880 align:start position:0%
introduce it but
 
02:10:09.510 --> 02:10:09.520 align:start position:0%
i'm just left without any idea whether
 
02:10:12.069 --> 02:10:12.079 align:start position:0%
there are serious impediments to funding
 
02:10:15.270 --> 02:10:15.280 align:start position:0%
these programs which i think their
 
02:10:17.189 --> 02:10:17.199 align:start position:0%
my general bias would be there probably
 
02:10:19.109 --> 02:10:19.119 align:start position:0%
are but i didn't i don't have any
 
02:10:22.229 --> 02:10:22.239 align:start position:0%
specifics about whether there are um
 
02:10:24.149 --> 02:10:24.159 align:start position:0%
financial impediments to funding these
 
02:10:26.310 --> 02:10:26.320 align:start position:0%
programs and and
 
02:10:28.390 --> 02:10:28.400 align:start position:0%
what they are so i just feel like i
 
02:10:30.629 --> 02:10:30.639 align:start position:0%
don't have enough information
 
02:10:30.639 --> 02:10:33.430 align:start position:0%
don't have enough information
um

02:10:33.430 --> 02:10:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:35.510 --> 02:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
to know if there needs to be a committee
 
02:10:37.350 --> 02:10:37.360 align:start position:0%
to study this so
 
02:10:37.360 --> 02:10:38.550 align:start position:0%
to study this so
um

02:10:38.550 --> 02:10:38.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:41.910 --> 02:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
i guess that's a reason to vote for
 
02:10:41.920 --> 02:10:43.750 align:start position:0%
i guess that's a reason to vote for
itl

02:10:43.750 --> 02:10:43.760 align:start position:0%
itl
 
02:10:43.760 --> 02:10:45.109 align:start position:0%
itl
unless

02:10:45.109 --> 02:10:45.119 align:start position:0%
unless
 
02:10:46.709 --> 02:10:46.719 align:start position:0%
unless that information is going to be
 
02:10:46.719 --> 02:10:48.390 align:start position:0%
unless that information is going to be
forthcoming

02:10:48.390 --> 02:10:48.400 align:start position:0%
forthcoming
 
02:10:51.430 --> 02:10:51.440 align:start position:0%
did anyone receive written testimony
 
02:10:54.550 --> 02:10:54.560 align:start position:0%
from the bill's sponsor on 502
 
02:11:02.950 --> 02:11:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:05.750 --> 02:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
representative weber
 
02:11:08.470 --> 02:11:08.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman well i think from
 
02:11:11.750 --> 02:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
ms vaughan we have significant testimony
 
02:11:14.550 --> 02:11:14.560 align:start position:0%
to show us that
 
02:11:14.560 --> 02:11:16.069 align:start position:0%
to show us that
the

02:11:16.069 --> 02:11:16.079 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:11:19.669 --> 02:11:19.679 align:start position:0%
funding that is allocated for
 
02:11:22.870 --> 02:11:22.880 align:start position:0%
tobacco prevention and youth is woefully
 
02:11:27.589 --> 02:11:27.599 align:start position:0%
underfunded by standard seti by the cdc
 
02:11:30.950 --> 02:11:30.960 align:start position:0%
uh it seems to me that that has been an
 
02:11:30.960 --> 02:11:32.069 align:start position:0%
uh it seems to me that that has been an
issue

02:11:32.069 --> 02:11:32.079 align:start position:0%
issue
 
02:11:35.270 --> 02:11:35.280 align:start position:0%
that certainly has plagued my 14 years
 
02:11:37.350 --> 02:11:37.360 align:start position:0%
in the legislature
 
02:11:40.229 --> 02:11:40.239 align:start position:0%
and the place that it actually the only
 
02:11:43.030 --> 02:11:43.040 align:start position:0%
place it can actually be addressed is in
 
02:11:44.149 --> 02:11:44.159 align:start position:0%
the budget
 
02:11:44.159 --> 02:11:45.109 align:start position:0%
the budget
so

02:11:45.109 --> 02:11:45.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:11:48.550 --> 02:11:48.560 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that people
 
02:11:48.560 --> 02:11:49.830 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that people
sorry

02:11:49.830 --> 02:11:49.840 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
02:11:49.840 --> 02:11:51.430 align:start position:0%
sorry
yeah

02:11:51.430 --> 02:11:51.440 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:11:53.189 --> 02:11:53.199 align:start position:0%
come on
 
02:11:54.470 --> 02:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:11:58.870 --> 02:11:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:58.880 --> 02:12:00.870 align:start position:0%
 
unless

02:12:00.870 --> 02:12:00.880 align:start position:0%
unless
 
02:12:02.390 --> 02:12:02.400 align:start position:0%
we can
 
02:12:04.709 --> 02:12:04.719 align:start position:0%
make an appropriation in our committee
 
02:12:06.390 --> 02:12:06.400 align:start position:0%
not with this bill because it didn't
 
02:12:08.629 --> 02:12:08.639 align:start position:0%
have one in it but
 
02:12:10.790 --> 02:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
a committee via a bill can make an
 
02:12:13.189 --> 02:12:13.199 align:start position:0%
appropriation but unless that gets
 
02:12:15.189 --> 02:12:15.199 align:start position:0%
passed and
 
02:12:18.470 --> 02:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
uh gets passed the finance committee and
 
02:12:21.189 --> 02:12:21.199 align:start position:0%
into the budget it doesn't matter what
 
02:12:22.310 --> 02:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
we do
 
02:12:25.750 --> 02:12:25.760 align:start position:0%
and as the chair has a great deal of
 
02:12:27.910 --> 02:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
information and and is actually being
 
02:12:30.709 --> 02:12:30.719 align:start position:0%
consulted by folks from finance which is
 
02:12:32.390 --> 02:12:32.400 align:start position:0%
a wonderful thing
 
02:12:35.830 --> 02:12:35.840 align:start position:0%
um we have a very good
 
02:12:39.189 --> 02:12:39.199 align:start position:0%
way of getting some information to them
 
02:12:41.669 --> 02:12:41.679 align:start position:0%
um and i think that the
 
02:12:44.229 --> 02:12:44.239 align:start position:0%
in addition to that a subcommittee of
 
02:12:46.470 --> 02:12:46.480 align:start position:0%
the health and human services oversight
 
02:12:49.589 --> 02:12:49.599 align:start position:0%
committee if we need one is an option
 
02:12:51.589 --> 02:12:51.599 align:start position:0%
but i don't think we need to study this
 
02:12:54.229 --> 02:12:54.239 align:start position:0%
issue it's woefully underfunded we ought
 
02:12:56.870 --> 02:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
to fund it more there are funds
 
02:13:00.390 --> 02:13:00.400 align:start position:0%
available from there are funds
 
02:13:03.910 --> 02:13:03.920 align:start position:0%
in that we get a tobacco settlement but
 
02:13:06.149 --> 02:13:06.159 align:start position:0%
that money gets allocated to other
 
02:13:09.430 --> 02:13:09.440 align:start position:0%
things by our budget writers so that's
 
02:13:11.109 --> 02:13:11.119 align:start position:0%
the problem and i don't think that
 
02:13:13.750 --> 02:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
having a committee or a commission or a
 
02:13:16.550 --> 02:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
subcommittee to study it actually gets
 
02:13:18.550 --> 02:13:18.560 align:start position:0%
us a lot farther forward what we need to
 
02:13:19.990 --> 02:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
do is get
 
02:13:22.069 --> 02:13:22.079 align:start position:0%
the money put into the budget
 
02:13:23.430 --> 02:13:23.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:13:27.270 --> 02:13:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:29.350 --> 02:13:29.360 align:start position:0%
someone else has a hand up that looks
 
02:13:33.750 --> 02:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:35.109 --> 02:13:35.119 align:start position:0%
yes and um
 
02:13:35.119 --> 02:13:35.990 align:start position:0%
yes and um
well

02:13:35.990 --> 02:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:13:37.750 --> 02:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
sitting here uh
 
02:13:40.069 --> 02:13:40.079 align:start position:0%
sorting out what we're doing i i
 
02:13:42.709 --> 02:13:42.719 align:start position:0%
i sort of even misheard what the issue
 
02:13:44.310 --> 02:13:44.320 align:start position:0%
is about how much money we spend but
 
02:13:46.310 --> 02:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
just to clarify i did quickly look it up
 
02:13:46.320 --> 02:13:47.189 align:start position:0%
just to clarify i did quickly look it up
for

02:13:47.189 --> 02:13:47.199 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:13:49.030 --> 02:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
the uh tobacco
 
02:13:50.629 --> 02:13:50.639 align:start position:0%
education and so on in new hampshire in
 
02:13:52.790 --> 02:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
the fiscal year 2019
 
02:13:54.189 --> 02:13:54.199 align:start position:0%
that though we took in
 
02:13:56.629 --> 02:13:56.639 align:start position:0%
255 million dollars in tobacco
 
02:13:58.950 --> 02:13:58.960 align:start position:0%
settlement and taxes we only allocated
 
02:14:01.189 --> 02:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
140 000
 
02:14:03.750 --> 02:14:03.760 align:start position:0%
to prevention which is the 0.8 of the
 
02:14:03.760 --> 02:14:04.950 align:start position:0%
to prevention which is the 0.8 of the
cdc

02:14:04.950 --> 02:14:04.960 align:start position:0%
cdc
 
02:14:07.270 --> 02:14:07.280 align:start position:0%
number as opposed to the 15 which would
 
02:14:09.109 --> 02:14:09.119 align:start position:0%
be a bare minimum so i agree with
 
02:14:10.790 --> 02:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
representative weber we don't need to
 
02:14:13.109 --> 02:14:13.119 align:start position:0%
think about it we just need to have the
 
02:14:15.750 --> 02:14:15.760 align:start position:0%
will to do it to realize that some of
 
02:14:17.589 --> 02:14:17.599 align:start position:0%
this money needs to go fund
 
02:14:19.990 --> 02:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
cessation not just to fund all the other
 
02:14:25.589 --> 02:14:25.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:25.599 --> 02:14:26.550 align:start position:0%
 
no

02:14:26.550 --> 02:14:26.560 align:start position:0%
no
 
02:14:31.270 --> 02:14:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:31.280 --> 02:14:39.189 align:start position:0%
 
unmute

02:14:39.189 --> 02:14:39.199 align:start position:0%

02:14:48.870 --> 02:14:48.880 align:start position:0%
we're not that good at reading your lips
 
02:14:48.880 --> 02:14:50.310 align:start position:0%
we're not that good at reading your lips
yeah

02:14:50.310 --> 02:14:50.320 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:14:52.470 --> 02:14:52.480 align:start position:0%
i thought you're gonna interpret that
 
02:14:55.750 --> 02:14:55.760 align:start position:0%
thank you i'm sorry my my computer
 
02:14:57.750 --> 02:14:57.760 align:start position:0%
automatically unmutes me from time to
 
02:14:59.109 --> 02:14:59.119 align:start position:0%
time but anyway
 
02:15:02.790 --> 02:15:02.800 align:start position:0%
can you hear me now yeah yes thank you
 
02:15:04.149 --> 02:15:04.159 align:start position:0%
i had the same question that
 
02:15:06.149 --> 02:15:06.159 align:start position:0%
representative canerck had but i just
 
02:15:07.750 --> 02:15:07.760 align:start position:0%
wondered if there was anything anywhere
 
02:15:10.390 --> 02:15:10.400 align:start position:0%
that had a percentage of that money that
 
02:15:12.310 --> 02:15:12.320 align:start position:0%
in this in the tobacco fund that's
 
02:15:14.629 --> 02:15:14.639 align:start position:0%
supposed to be spent on prevention is
 
02:15:17.430 --> 02:15:17.440 align:start position:0%
there a percentage somebody said 15
 
02:15:23.109 --> 02:15:23.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:23.119 --> 02:15:24.629 align:start position:0%
 
hello

02:15:24.629 --> 02:15:24.639 align:start position:0%
hello
 
02:15:24.639 --> 02:15:26.629 align:start position:0%
hello
representative

02:15:26.629 --> 02:15:26.639 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:15:28.629 --> 02:15:28.639 align:start position:0%
yeah it was what they were referring to
 
02:15:32.950 --> 02:15:32.960 align:start position:0%
was 15 of a spending target from the cdc
 
02:15:33.910 --> 02:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
02:15:35.830 --> 02:15:35.840 align:start position:0%
uh at least the information i've dug up
 
02:15:38.229 --> 02:15:38.239 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have a percentage of what
 
02:15:39.830 --> 02:15:39.840 align:start position:0%
we're supposed to be using within the
 
02:15:41.109 --> 02:15:41.119 align:start position:0%
state but we know that the state
 
02:15:43.109 --> 02:15:43.119 align:start position:0%
chronically does these things i mean
 
02:15:45.350 --> 02:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
think about the meals and rooms tax
 
02:15:47.030 --> 02:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
it's it's not returned back to the
 
02:15:49.189 --> 02:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
municipalities the way it should
 
02:15:51.669 --> 02:15:51.679 align:start position:0%
this is not being put into tobacco
 
02:15:51.679 --> 02:15:52.709 align:start position:0%
this is not being put into tobacco
cessation

02:15:52.709 --> 02:15:52.719 align:start position:0%
cessation
 
02:15:55.270 --> 02:15:55.280 align:start position:0%
as it should
 
02:15:55.280 --> 02:15:56.790 align:start position:0%
as it should
and

02:15:56.790 --> 02:15:56.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:15:58.470 --> 02:15:58.480 align:start position:0%
those individuals on the committee
 
02:16:01.109 --> 02:16:01.119 align:start position:0%
follow up those individuals
 
02:16:04.149 --> 02:16:04.159 align:start position:0%
are they in as good a position as anyone
 
02:16:07.430 --> 02:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
to look at this situation and ask if the
 
02:16:09.669 --> 02:16:09.679 align:start position:0%
percentage of those funds that are spent
 
02:16:11.350 --> 02:16:11.360 align:start position:0%
on prevention
 
02:16:13.109 --> 02:16:13.119 align:start position:0%
is adequate i mean i don't know we need
 
02:16:14.550 --> 02:16:14.560 align:start position:0%
a new committee
 
02:16:16.069 --> 02:16:16.079 align:start position:0%
to do that i think the oversight
 
02:16:17.990 --> 02:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
committee can handle this and we will
 
02:16:20.950 --> 02:16:20.960 align:start position:0%
ask people to testify before us and so
 
02:16:20.960 --> 02:16:21.990 align:start position:0%
ask people to testify before us and so
on

02:16:21.990 --> 02:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:16:25.589 --> 02:16:25.599 align:start position:0%

40 minutes late
 
02:18:31.190 --> 02:18:31.200 align:start position:0%
is house bill 381
 
02:18:35.509 --> 02:18:35.519 align:start position:0%
relative to laboratory testing
 
02:18:39.429 --> 02:18:39.439 align:start position:0%
and representative edwards is recognized
 
02:18:42.950 --> 02:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
to introduce his bill
 
02:18:42.960 --> 02:18:51.990 align:start position:0%
to introduce his bill
ah

02:18:51.990 --> 02:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:54.230 --> 02:18:54.240 align:start position:0%
okay so i'm off of mute i don't know if
 
02:18:56.389 --> 02:18:56.399 align:start position:0%
you can see me uh if you can it's
 
02:18:59.110 --> 02:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
unfortunate i put a coat and tie on
 
02:19:01.669 --> 02:19:01.679 align:start position:0%
uh i'm uh i'm representative jess
 
02:19:04.709 --> 02:19:04.719 align:start position:0%
edwards i represent uh auburn
 
02:19:07.190 --> 02:19:07.200 align:start position:0%
chester and stand down
 
02:19:11.270 --> 02:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:15.589 --> 02:19:15.599 align:start position:0%
house bill 381 fn is
 
02:19:18.070 --> 02:19:18.080 align:start position:0%
essentially identical to the bill that
 
02:19:21.190 --> 02:19:21.200 align:start position:0%
was heard last term by this committee
 
02:19:24.150 --> 02:19:24.160 align:start position:0%
the the difference was last term
 
02:19:27.349 --> 02:19:27.359 align:start position:0%
we had a bill in an amendment to go with
 
02:19:29.429 --> 02:19:29.439 align:start position:0%
it to improve it
 
02:19:31.830 --> 02:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
and this bill is fully integrated so
 
02:19:34.709 --> 02:19:34.719 align:start position:0%
it's just one bill no amendment uh what
 
02:19:37.830 --> 02:19:37.840 align:start position:0%
it does is essentially establishes or or
 
02:19:39.750 --> 02:19:39.760 align:start position:0%
advances it doesn't establish but it
 
02:19:41.669 --> 02:19:41.679 align:start position:0%
advances the principle
 
02:19:43.190 --> 02:19:43.200 align:start position:0%
uh that
 
02:19:46.950 --> 02:19:46.960 align:start position:0%
individuals should be able to get
 
02:19:49.670 --> 02:19:49.680 align:start position:0%
information about their own medical
 
02:19:49.680 --> 02:19:51.750 align:start position:0%
information about their own medical
conditions

02:19:51.750 --> 02:19:51.760 align:start position:0%
conditions
 
02:19:54.309 --> 02:19:54.319 align:start position:0%
and that they should be able to do that
 
02:19:55.910 --> 02:19:55.920 align:start position:0%
in a
 
02:19:58.790 --> 02:19:58.800 align:start position:0%
most efficient least or least expensive
 
02:20:00.389 --> 02:20:00.399 align:start position:0%
way possible
 
02:20:03.590 --> 02:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
the bill would allow an individual adult
 
02:20:05.030 --> 02:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
to go in
 
02:20:07.510 --> 02:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
and order a diagnostic pathology
 
02:20:07.520 --> 02:20:09.429 align:start position:0%
and order a diagnostic pathology
procedure

02:20:09.429 --> 02:20:09.439 align:start position:0%
procedure
 
02:20:12.950 --> 02:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
and uh and receive it if the pathology
 
02:20:12.960 --> 02:20:14.230 align:start position:0%
and uh and receive it if the pathology
service

02:20:14.230 --> 02:20:14.240 align:start position:0%
service
 
02:20:16.790 --> 02:20:16.800 align:start position:0%
chooses to provide the service
 
02:20:20.550 --> 02:20:20.560 align:start position:0%
the pathology services are not mandated
 
02:20:23.670 --> 02:20:23.680 align:start position:0%
under this bill they're enabled to do a
 
02:20:26.950 --> 02:20:26.960 align:start position:0%
direct diagnostic pathology test
 
02:20:28.630 --> 02:20:28.640 align:start position:0%
at the patient's own
 
02:20:31.510 --> 02:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
personal request
 
02:20:31.520 --> 02:20:32.309 align:start position:0%
personal request
the

02:20:32.309 --> 02:20:32.319 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:20:34.950 --> 02:20:34.960 align:start position:0%
patient is required under this bill to
 
02:20:36.790 --> 02:20:36.800 align:start position:0%
pay for it themselves when they're
 
02:20:39.030 --> 02:20:39.040 align:start position:0%
ordering it themselves
 
02:20:41.429 --> 02:20:41.439 align:start position:0%
so there's more personal accountability
 
02:20:41.439 --> 02:20:42.710 align:start position:0%
so there's more personal accountability
there

02:20:42.710 --> 02:20:42.720 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:20:45.349 --> 02:20:45.359 align:start position:0%
the pathology service
 
02:20:48.070 --> 02:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
needs to be nationally certified uh
 
02:20:49.830 --> 02:20:49.840 align:start position:0%
which was an important part of the
 
02:20:51.990 --> 02:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
amendment last year that's now in the
 
02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:52.950 align:start position:0%
amendment last year that's now in the
bill

02:20:52.950 --> 02:20:52.960 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:20:52.960 --> 02:20:54.150 align:start position:0%
bill
um

02:20:54.150 --> 02:20:54.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:55.190 --> 02:20:55.200 align:start position:0%
and then
 
02:20:57.830 --> 02:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
the the physicians
 
02:20:59.190 --> 02:20:59.200 align:start position:0%
that may
 
02:21:01.590 --> 02:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
have this person as a patient
 
02:21:04.630 --> 02:21:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:07.990 --> 02:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
they're not held liable for anything
 
02:21:10.550 --> 02:21:10.560 align:start position:0%
resulting in their diagnos diagnosis and
 
02:21:13.110 --> 02:21:13.120 align:start position:0%
treatment unless they are aware of the
 
02:21:15.830 --> 02:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
of the laboratory procedure
 
02:21:19.349 --> 02:21:19.359 align:start position:0%
so um this bill would have helped me in
 
02:21:21.750 --> 02:21:21.760 align:start position:0%
a narrow instance and so i think it's
 
02:21:23.349 --> 02:21:23.359 align:start position:0%
going to help others
 
02:21:26.070 --> 02:21:26.080 align:start position:0%
i i went naked without health insurance
 
02:21:29.750 --> 02:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
leaving my corporate job before i
 
02:21:31.990 --> 02:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
got into the age category where the va
 
02:21:33.750 --> 02:21:33.760 align:start position:0%
provided me care so there were about
 
02:21:36.070 --> 02:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
nine months there where i knew that i
 
02:21:36.080 --> 02:21:37.110 align:start position:0%
nine months there where i knew that i
had

02:21:37.110 --> 02:21:37.120 align:start position:0%
had
 
02:21:39.990 --> 02:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
type 2 diabetes and then i wanted to get
 
02:21:41.510 --> 02:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
an a1c
 
02:21:44.150 --> 02:21:44.160 align:start position:0%
uh i i knew how to interpret the number
 
02:21:47.030 --> 02:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
of an a1c it's not really rocket science
 
02:21:47.040 --> 02:21:48.389 align:start position:0%
of an a1c it's not really rocket science
uh

02:21:48.389 --> 02:21:48.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:21:51.750 --> 02:21:51.760 align:start position:0%
six or thereabouts is kind of okay
 
02:21:53.910 --> 02:21:53.920 align:start position:0%
the double digits you got a real problem
 
02:21:53.920 --> 02:21:54.870 align:start position:0%
the double digits you got a real problem
so

02:21:54.870 --> 02:21:54.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:21:59.429 --> 02:21:59.439 align:start position:0%
um so so it would help to me but um
 
02:21:59.439 --> 02:22:00.070 align:start position:0%
um so so it would help to me but um
i

02:22:00.070 --> 02:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:22:02.870 --> 02:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
when i went in to ask one of the local
 
02:22:05.110 --> 02:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
labs they they said they weren't
 
02:22:07.830 --> 02:22:07.840 align:start position:0%
authorized without a physician's order
 
02:22:09.990 --> 02:22:10.000 align:start position:0%
now that might have been policy
 
02:22:12.950 --> 02:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
but but what i'm suggesting is that this
 
02:22:12.960 --> 02:22:13.750 align:start position:0%
but but what i'm suggesting is that this
bill

02:22:13.750 --> 02:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:22:16.550 --> 02:22:16.560 align:start position:0%
would uh emulate what arizona has done
 
02:22:19.270 --> 02:22:19.280 align:start position:0%
for three or four years now
 
02:22:21.110 --> 02:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
there doesn't seem to be any problems in
 
02:22:24.389 --> 02:22:24.399 align:start position:0%
arizona with it and i would ask that we
 
02:22:28.389 --> 02:22:28.399 align:start position:0%
advance this very small medical freedom
 
02:22:28.399 --> 02:22:29.349 align:start position:0%
advance this very small medical freedom
bill

02:22:29.349 --> 02:22:29.359 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:22:30.870 --> 02:22:30.880 align:start position:0%
free market bill
 
02:22:33.830 --> 02:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire and if you're
 
02:22:36.230 --> 02:22:36.240 align:start position:0%
you're concerned about the physician
 
02:22:39.670 --> 02:22:39.680 align:start position:0%
outside of the loop and i would just
 
02:22:42.309 --> 02:22:42.319 align:start position:0%
remind you that increasingly we have
 
02:22:45.270 --> 02:22:45.280 align:start position:0%
wearable diagnostics
 
02:22:48.070 --> 02:22:48.080 align:start position:0%
that are taking all kinds of diagnostic
 
02:22:50.870 --> 02:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
information and allowing us to to look
 
02:22:51.750 --> 02:22:51.760 align:start position:0%
at them
 
02:22:51.760 --> 02:22:53.590 align:start position:0%
at them
ourselves

02:22:53.590 --> 02:22:53.600 align:start position:0%
ourselves
 
02:22:53.600 --> 02:22:54.469 align:start position:0%
ourselves
and

02:22:54.469 --> 02:22:54.479 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:22:56.950 --> 02:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
that medical information
 
02:22:59.190 --> 02:22:59.200 align:start position:0%
is not necessarily integrated with your
 
02:23:01.190 --> 02:23:01.200 align:start position:0%
medical record so
 
02:23:03.190 --> 02:23:03.200 align:start position:0%
we already have a situation where the
 
02:23:03.200 --> 02:23:04.469 align:start position:0%
we already have a situation where the
technology

02:23:04.469 --> 02:23:04.479 align:start position:0%
technology
 
02:23:06.630 --> 02:23:06.640 align:start position:0%
is getting out in front of our brick and
 
02:23:08.469 --> 02:23:08.479 align:start position:0%
mortar system
 
02:23:11.429 --> 02:23:11.439 align:start position:0%
and and what this bill would do would be
 
02:23:13.190 --> 02:23:13.200 align:start position:0%
to allow our brick and mortar
 
02:23:15.670 --> 02:23:15.680 align:start position:0%
laboratories to basically
 
02:23:17.510 --> 02:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
keep pace with
 
02:23:19.270 --> 02:23:19.280 align:start position:0%
the evolving nature of our health care
 
02:23:19.280 --> 02:23:20.309 align:start position:0%
the evolving nature of our health care
system

02:23:20.309 --> 02:23:20.319 align:start position:0%
system
 
02:23:23.429 --> 02:23:23.439 align:start position:0%
so with that i'd ask you to
 
02:23:26.550 --> 02:23:26.560 align:start position:0%
consider this bill and offer it up as a
 
02:23:29.910 --> 02:23:29.920 align:start position:0%
otp and i'll take questions if there are
 
02:23:32.950 --> 02:23:32.960 align:start position:0%
any and we'll call on people to ask you
 
02:23:34.710 --> 02:23:34.720 align:start position:0%
questions in just a minute but i'm
 
02:23:36.630 --> 02:23:36.640 align:start position:0%
moving ahead dr
 
02:23:39.670 --> 02:23:39.680 align:start position:0%
gary sobelson from the new hampshire
 
02:23:42.469 --> 02:23:42.479 align:start position:0%
medical society because he has told me
 
02:23:45.270 --> 02:23:45.280 align:start position:0%
he has patience imminently so if dr
 
02:23:48.630 --> 02:23:48.640 align:start position:0%
sobelson you're still on the meeting and
 
02:23:50.230 --> 02:23:50.240 align:start position:0%
wish to testify
 
02:23:55.110 --> 02:23:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:57.830 --> 02:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
i am and thank you very much for that uh
 
02:23:59.910 --> 02:23:59.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity can you can you hear me uh
 
02:23:59.920 --> 02:24:04.150 align:start position:0%
opportunity can you can you hear me uh
chairman

02:24:04.150 --> 02:24:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:06.550 --> 02:24:06.560 align:start position:0%
am i being heard you are being heard and
 
02:24:08.230 --> 02:24:08.240 align:start position:0%
and thank you
 
02:24:08.240 --> 02:24:09.270 align:start position:0%
and thank you
um

02:24:09.270 --> 02:24:09.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:10.710 --> 02:24:10.720 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chairman and
 
02:24:12.389 --> 02:24:12.399 align:start position:0%
representatives uh thank you for this
 
02:24:14.550 --> 02:24:14.560 align:start position:0%
opportunity to present my testimony
 
02:24:17.030 --> 02:24:17.040 align:start position:0%
regarding hb 381
 
02:24:19.270 --> 02:24:19.280 align:start position:0%
my name is dr gary sobelson and i'm a
 
02:24:21.910 --> 02:24:21.920 align:start position:0%
family physician in concord
 
02:24:23.510 --> 02:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
i come here though representing the new
 
02:24:25.270 --> 02:24:25.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire medical society
 
02:24:27.590 --> 02:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
and we do wish to speak against passage
 
02:24:29.190 --> 02:24:29.200 align:start position:0%
of this bill
 
02:24:33.110 --> 02:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
um hb 381 exposes the challenge of
 
02:24:35.670 --> 02:24:35.680 align:start position:0%
maintaining scientific professionalism
 
02:24:38.309 --> 02:24:38.319 align:start position:0%
in an increasing consumer-driven society
 
02:24:40.790 --> 02:24:40.800 align:start position:0%
i think the uh the
 
02:24:42.309 --> 02:24:42.319 align:start position:0%
representative who just presented this
 
02:24:43.750 --> 02:24:43.760 align:start position:0%
bill absolutely
 
02:24:46.230 --> 02:24:46.240 align:start position:0%
presented that case
 
02:24:47.910 --> 02:24:47.920 align:start position:0%
its goal to increase access to
 
02:24:50.070 --> 02:24:50.080 align:start position:0%
laboratory medicine is very tempting and
 
02:24:52.070 --> 02:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
attempts to open up a broad area of
 
02:24:54.389 --> 02:24:54.399 align:start position:0%
medical practice
 
02:24:56.550 --> 02:24:56.560 align:start position:0%
previously limited by what are almost
 
02:24:58.630 --> 02:24:58.640 align:start position:0%
centuries-old constraints certainly more
 
02:24:58.640 --> 02:24:59.670 align:start position:0%
centuries-old constraints certainly more
recent

02:24:59.670 --> 02:24:59.680 align:start position:0%
recent
 
02:25:02.309 --> 02:25:02.319 align:start position:0%
somewhat like the effect of dr google
 
02:25:04.389 --> 02:25:04.399 align:start position:0%
with regard to medical knowledge
 
02:25:05.990 --> 02:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
would suggest that individuals can
 
02:25:07.750 --> 02:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
successfully manage their own medical
 
02:25:09.349 --> 02:25:09.359 align:start position:0%
affairs and should have the freedom to
 
02:25:10.630 --> 02:25:10.640 align:start position:0%
do so
 
02:25:12.070 --> 02:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
but the new hampshire medical society
 
02:25:14.630 --> 02:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
would suggest that hb 381
 
02:25:17.190 --> 02:25:17.200 align:start position:0%
is a pandora's box and we would
 
02:25:19.429 --> 02:25:19.439 align:start position:0%
encourage the new hampshire legislature
 
02:25:22.389 --> 02:25:22.399 align:start position:0%
not open this box at this time
 
02:25:24.230 --> 02:25:24.240 align:start position:0%
the ordering of laboratory tests is a
 
02:25:26.550 --> 02:25:26.560 align:start position:0%
very complex and essential component of
 
02:25:28.309 --> 02:25:28.319 align:start position:0%
the practice of medicine
 
02:25:30.550 --> 02:25:30.560 align:start position:0%
as opposed to the simplicity that the
 
02:25:32.550 --> 02:25:32.560 align:start position:0%
prior representative just presented with
 
02:25:35.030 --> 02:25:35.040 align:start position:0%
regard to a test that in fact might be a
 
02:25:37.110 --> 02:25:37.120 align:start position:0%
good one to have available
 
02:25:39.429 --> 02:25:39.439 align:start position:0%
much is not simple in laboratory
 
02:25:41.910 --> 02:25:41.920 align:start position:0%
medicine but it's actually not for that
 
02:25:44.070 --> 02:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
reason that we traditional reason that
 
02:25:45.429 --> 02:25:45.439 align:start position:0%
we oppose the bill
 
02:25:48.550 --> 02:25:48.560 align:start position:0%
it's really because profound educational
 
02:25:50.870 --> 02:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
quality monitoring and yes even with the
 
02:25:52.389 --> 02:25:52.399 align:start position:0%
bills line
 
02:25:54.790 --> 02:25:54.800 align:start position:0%
liability bearing responsibilities are
 
02:25:57.510 --> 02:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
closely tied to this decision making
 
02:25:59.510 --> 02:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
in order to effectively order laboratory
 
02:26:02.230 --> 02:26:02.240 align:start position:0%
tests a medical professional is required
 
02:26:04.469 --> 02:26:04.479 align:start position:0%
to understand the pathophysiology behind
 
02:26:07.110 --> 02:26:07.120 align:start position:0%
them the rationale of the test use
 
02:26:09.270 --> 02:26:09.280 align:start position:0%
perform risk benefit and cost benefit
 
02:26:09.280 --> 02:26:10.389 align:start position:0%
perform risk benefit and cost benefit
analysis

02:26:10.389 --> 02:26:10.399 align:start position:0%
analysis
 
02:26:12.469 --> 02:26:12.479 align:start position:0%
and consider the proper use and
 
02:26:15.670 --> 02:26:15.680 align:start position:0%
consequences of creating medical data
 
02:26:17.349 --> 02:26:17.359 align:start position:0%
ordering and interpreting most medical
 
02:26:19.990 --> 02:26:20.000 align:start position:0%
tests requires understanding
 
02:26:22.230 --> 02:26:22.240 align:start position:0%
of test sensitivity and specificity
 
02:26:23.830 --> 02:26:23.840 align:start position:0%
positive and negative predictive value
 
02:26:26.150 --> 02:26:26.160 align:start position:0%
and similar concepts um stuff that a lot
 
02:26:27.590 --> 02:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
of americans have become a little bit
 
02:26:30.230 --> 02:26:30.240 align:start position:0%
familiar with listening to uh covet test
 
02:26:32.870 --> 02:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
results over the past year but for what
 
02:26:35.590 --> 02:26:35.600 align:start position:0%
we would argue is a very complex set of
 
02:26:38.469 --> 02:26:38.479 align:start position:0%
decision making for a
 
02:26:41.190 --> 02:26:41.200 align:start position:0%
very very large number of tests and most
 
02:26:42.950 --> 02:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
importantly it requires that all our
 
02:26:44.710 --> 02:26:44.720 align:start position:0%
clinicians take responsibility for
 
02:26:45.910 --> 02:26:45.920 align:start position:0%
interpreting the meaning of those
 
02:26:48.389 --> 02:26:48.399 align:start position:0%
results within the context
 
02:26:50.950 --> 02:26:50.960 align:start position:0%
of a specific patient's medical needs
 
02:26:52.389 --> 02:26:52.399 align:start position:0%
now again an individual may say that
 
02:26:53.670 --> 02:26:53.680 align:start position:0%
they're the ultimate owner of those
 
02:26:55.910 --> 02:26:55.920 align:start position:0%
needs but but that's not something that
 
02:26:57.750 --> 02:26:57.760 align:start position:0%
applies to every piece of data about
 
02:27:00.230 --> 02:27:00.240 align:start position:0%
them the efforts of this bill to gloss
 
02:27:01.830 --> 02:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
over those elements with statutory
 
02:27:04.070 --> 02:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
language do not persuade our profession
 
02:27:05.510 --> 02:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
of that wisdom
 
02:27:08.150 --> 02:27:08.160 align:start position:0%
unnecessary tests lead to unnecessary
 
02:27:11.190 --> 02:27:11.200 align:start position:0%
care is a well-grained maxim in that in
 
02:27:13.190 --> 02:27:13.200 align:start position:0%
the education of a doctor or a pa or a
 
02:27:14.710 --> 02:27:14.720 align:start position:0%
nurse practitioner
 
02:27:17.830 --> 02:27:17.840 align:start position:0%
more is not better than the area
 
02:27:20.469 --> 02:27:20.479 align:start position:0%
diagnostic testing and in fact it comes
 
02:27:22.150 --> 02:27:22.160 align:start position:0%
with measurable and significant risks
 
02:27:23.990 --> 02:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
that we study and discuss in our
 
02:27:25.510 --> 02:27:25.520 align:start position:0%
literature and they become our
 
02:27:27.030 --> 02:27:27.040 align:start position:0%
responsibility to understand and
 
02:27:27.040 --> 02:27:28.309 align:start position:0%
responsibility to understand and
practice

02:27:28.309 --> 02:27:28.319 align:start position:0%
practice
 
02:27:30.150 --> 02:27:30.160 align:start position:0%
ultimately the issue of medical
 
02:27:31.670 --> 02:27:31.680 align:start position:0%
liability will be settled by the
 
02:27:33.670 --> 02:27:33.680 align:start position:0%
judiciary and despite the earnest
 
02:27:35.110 --> 02:27:35.120 align:start position:0%
efforts of a section in this bill
 
02:27:37.590 --> 02:27:37.600 align:start position:0%
section 4 to relieve clinicians of
 
02:27:39.590 --> 02:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
liability stemming from actions proposed
 
02:27:40.870 --> 02:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
by the bill
 
02:27:43.270 --> 02:27:43.280 align:start position:0%
i would suggest to you that our society
 
02:27:44.550 --> 02:27:44.560 align:start position:0%
would support that the downstream
 
02:27:48.070 --> 02:27:48.080 align:start position:0%
ramifications are impossible to predict
 
02:27:50.710 --> 02:27:50.720 align:start position:0%
while hb 381 tries to dissect off
 
02:27:52.710 --> 02:27:52.720 align:start position:0%
insurance building
 
02:27:54.389 --> 02:27:54.399 align:start position:0%
billing and therefore increased medical
 
02:27:56.070 --> 02:27:56.080 align:start position:0%
costs from its goals there is no
 
02:27:58.070 --> 02:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
question to me as a clinician that one
 
02:27:59.510 --> 02:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
of the first outcomes of data being
 
02:28:02.790 --> 02:28:02.800 align:start position:0%
presented to me that i didn't ask for
 
02:28:05.429 --> 02:28:05.439 align:start position:0%
is is that i'm going to repeat the test
 
02:28:07.349 --> 02:28:07.359 align:start position:0%
it's done throughout our medical system
 
02:28:10.309 --> 02:28:10.319 align:start position:0%
we see it all the time or even worse
 
02:28:12.389 --> 02:28:12.399 align:start position:0%
perform expensive follow-up studies that
 
02:28:14.150 --> 02:28:14.160 align:start position:0%
weren't needed in the first place but
 
02:28:16.230 --> 02:28:16.240 align:start position:0%
now they're required for liability and
 
02:28:18.550 --> 02:28:18.560 align:start position:0%
defensive medicine purposes this is
 
02:28:20.550 --> 02:28:20.560 align:start position:0%
already a very significant issue in
 
02:28:22.710 --> 02:28:22.720 align:start position:0%
medical practice and an awful lot of our
 
02:28:25.030 --> 02:28:25.040 align:start position:0%
medical resources go to evaluate what we
 
02:28:26.950 --> 02:28:26.960 align:start position:0%
call incidental omas
 
02:28:28.870 --> 02:28:28.880 align:start position:0%
things that are identified on a lab
 
02:28:30.870 --> 02:28:30.880 align:start position:0%
panel or a diagnostic test but they're
 
02:28:32.950 --> 02:28:32.960 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly unlikely to be important
 
02:28:34.469 --> 02:28:34.479 align:start position:0%
to a patient's health
 
02:28:36.389 --> 02:28:36.399 align:start position:0%
this patient is really hard this problem
 
02:28:38.070 --> 02:28:38.080 align:start position:0%
by the way is very hard to address even
 
02:28:40.389 --> 02:28:40.399 align:start position:0%
in its current form but legislation like
 
02:28:42.309 --> 02:28:42.319 align:start position:0%
the one in front of you will undoubtedly
 
02:28:44.950 --> 02:28:44.960 align:start position:0%
expand such practices and therefore will
 
02:28:47.190 --> 02:28:47.200 align:start position:0%
have significant cost ramifications to
 
02:28:49.190 --> 02:28:49.200 align:start position:0%
programs like new hampshire medicaid
 
02:28:51.030 --> 02:28:51.040 align:start position:0%
insurance companies and ultimately to
 
02:28:52.870 --> 02:28:52.880 align:start position:0%
all of us
 
02:28:55.270 --> 02:28:55.280 align:start position:0%
the fda has a robust and coherent
 
02:28:57.190 --> 02:28:57.200 align:start position:0%
program for assessing and approving
 
02:28:59.510 --> 02:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
direct to consumer testing there's home
 
02:29:01.670 --> 02:29:01.680 align:start position:0%
testing kits and mail-in systems that
 
02:29:03.190 --> 02:29:03.200 align:start position:0%
address many of the goals of this
 
02:29:05.429 --> 02:29:05.439 align:start position:0%
legislation and this should be the path
 
02:29:07.349 --> 02:29:07.359 align:start position:0%
by which medical testing becomes
 
02:29:09.910 --> 02:29:09.920 align:start position:0%
consumer friendly and accessible
 
02:29:11.590 --> 02:29:11.600 align:start position:0%
such important home tests that we all
 
02:29:13.910 --> 02:29:13.920 align:start position:0%
are used to pregnancy testing ovulation
 
02:29:17.110 --> 02:29:17.120 align:start position:0%
testing blood sugar testing hiv testing
 
02:29:19.750 --> 02:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
and recently approved coven 19 testing
 
02:29:21.510 --> 02:29:21.520 align:start position:0%
have been approved
 
02:29:23.590 --> 02:29:23.600 align:start position:0%
after they are scrutinized for accuracy
 
02:29:25.750 --> 02:29:25.760 align:start position:0%
for narrowness of purpose usefulness to
 
02:29:27.590 --> 02:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
the public and with consideration to
 
02:29:29.510 --> 02:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
their advantages and dangers
 
02:29:32.469 --> 02:29:32.479 align:start position:0%
a bill like hb 381 that
 
02:29:34.230 --> 02:29:34.240 align:start position:0%
broadly opens up medical laboratory
 
02:29:36.710 --> 02:29:36.720 align:start position:0%
testing meets none of those criteria in
 
02:29:38.070 --> 02:29:38.080 align:start position:0%
our view
 
02:29:40.309 --> 02:29:40.319 align:start position:0%
to conclude one can purchase a scalpel
 
02:29:42.309 --> 02:29:42.319 align:start position:0%
and you can use it to cut balsa wood or
 
02:29:44.550 --> 02:29:44.560 align:start position:0%
create beautiful works of art but we do
 
02:29:46.550 --> 02:29:46.560 align:start position:0%
not legislate opening up the operating
 
02:29:48.469 --> 02:29:48.479 align:start position:0%
rooms of our state hospitals to anyone
 
02:29:51.030 --> 02:29:51.040 align:start position:0%
who can wield a knife
 
02:29:52.710 --> 02:29:52.720 align:start position:0%
similarly while the safety of many
 
02:29:54.469 --> 02:29:54.479 align:start position:0%
over-the-counter products has increased
 
02:29:56.790 --> 02:29:56.800 align:start position:0%
access and reduced costs to allergy
 
02:29:59.030 --> 02:29:59.040 align:start position:0%
medications minor pain relievers and
 
02:30:01.990 --> 02:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
low-cost steroid low-potency steroid
 
02:30:04.309 --> 02:30:04.319 align:start position:0%
greens through a rigorous fda assessment
 
02:30:06.309 --> 02:30:06.319 align:start position:0%
program about the value and safety of
 
02:30:08.150 --> 02:30:08.160 align:start position:0%
each product
 
02:30:09.830 --> 02:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
the american health system has chosen
 
02:30:12.710 --> 02:30:12.720 align:start position:0%
not to let consumer demand define access
 
02:30:15.990 --> 02:30:16.000 align:start position:0%
to opioids systemic antibiotics and many
 
02:30:18.550 --> 02:30:18.560 align:start position:0%
high potency prescription medications
 
02:30:19.990 --> 02:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
understanding that the same principles
 
02:30:22.469 --> 02:30:22.479 align:start position:0%
presented here require that the control
 
02:30:24.630 --> 02:30:24.640 align:start position:0%
of such products through statute and law
 
02:30:26.230 --> 02:30:26.240 align:start position:0%
are preferred to the temptation of
 
02:30:28.389 --> 02:30:28.399 align:start position:0%
absolute freedom because of the dangers
 
02:30:32.230 --> 02:30:32.240 align:start position:0%
both obvious and inadvertent may ensue
 
02:30:33.830 --> 02:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire medical society with
 
02:30:35.910 --> 02:30:35.920 align:start position:0%
over 2 000 physician members request
 
02:30:38.150 --> 02:30:38.160 align:start position:0%
that you consider the obvious and
 
02:30:41.190 --> 02:30:41.200 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences of hb 381 and
 
02:30:43.110 --> 02:30:43.120 align:start position:0%
vote to defeat its purposes
 
02:30:44.469 --> 02:30:44.479 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:30:48.070 --> 02:30:48.080 align:start position:0%
would you take some questions doctor
 
02:30:50.309 --> 02:30:50.319 align:start position:0%
i can for a few moments yes
 
02:30:52.070 --> 02:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
okay any questions for the doctor
 
02:30:54.070 --> 02:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
because he's got a run
 
02:30:56.630 --> 02:30:56.640 align:start position:0%
uh okay somebody who just waved an index
 
02:30:56.640 --> 02:31:05.590 align:start position:0%
uh okay somebody who just waved an index
finger

02:31:05.590 --> 02:31:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:07.750 --> 02:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
representative marsh
 
02:31:09.670 --> 02:31:09.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you dr
 
02:31:11.750 --> 02:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
sobelson for taking my question it's a
 
02:31:15.190 --> 02:31:15.200 align:start position:0%
pleasure uh hearing you again today
 
02:31:16.950 --> 02:31:16.960 align:start position:0%
would i not be correct that there are
 
02:31:19.030 --> 02:31:19.040 align:start position:0%
already a number of sites across the
 
02:31:21.110 --> 02:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire where consumers
 
02:31:23.830 --> 02:31:23.840 align:start position:0%
can go and order their laboratory tests
 
02:31:25.910 --> 02:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
without a doctor's order have them
 
02:31:27.590 --> 02:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
shipped to laboratories in the state of
 
02:31:27.600 --> 02:31:28.550 align:start position:0%
shipped to laboratories in the state of
arizona

02:31:28.550 --> 02:31:28.560 align:start position:0%
arizona
 
02:31:30.070 --> 02:31:30.080 align:start position:0%
and have them perform
 
02:31:32.550 --> 02:31:32.560 align:start position:0%
and so therefore the only effect of this
 
02:31:34.950 --> 02:31:34.960 align:start position:0%
bill will be to allow new hampshire
 
02:31:36.950 --> 02:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
laboratories to compete on a level
 
02:31:39.110 --> 02:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
playing field with laboratories in the
 
02:31:41.429 --> 02:31:41.439 align:start position:0%
state of arizona
 
02:31:44.150 --> 02:31:44.160 align:start position:0%
i representative marsh dr marsh i am not
 
02:31:46.309 --> 02:31:46.319 align:start position:0%
familiar with such labs um i have no
 
02:31:47.910 --> 02:31:47.920 align:start position:0%
doubt that there are different states
 
02:31:49.270 --> 02:31:49.280 align:start position:0%
with different laws
 
02:31:52.389 --> 02:31:52.399 align:start position:0%
um my my comment is really about what
 
02:31:54.469 --> 02:31:54.479 align:start position:0%
new hampshire law and new azure stats
 
02:31:56.950 --> 02:31:56.960 align:start position:0%
should should propose i do not know of
 
02:31:59.030 --> 02:31:59.040 align:start position:0%
what you speak
 
02:32:01.830 --> 02:32:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:01.840 --> 02:32:02.990 align:start position:0%
 
and

02:32:02.990 --> 02:32:03.000 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chairman and also thank you
 
02:32:11.670 --> 02:32:11.680 align:start position:0%
for taking my question dr sobel son
 
02:32:13.349 --> 02:32:13.359 align:start position:0%
following up on dr marsha's website
 
02:32:15.030 --> 02:32:15.040 align:start position:0%
marsha's question
 
02:32:16.550 --> 02:32:16.560 align:start position:0%
i'm aware of the fact i think even in
 
02:32:18.150 --> 02:32:18.160 align:start position:0%
vermont next door
 
02:32:20.070 --> 02:32:20.080 align:start position:0%
that they allow for a lot of the testing
 
02:32:21.510 --> 02:32:21.520 align:start position:0%
we're talking about prohibiting here in
 
02:32:22.710 --> 02:32:22.720 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
02:32:24.389 --> 02:32:24.399 align:start position:0%
i think there's 37 states that now
 
02:32:26.150 --> 02:32:26.160 align:start position:0%
currently allow for it so i don't know
 
02:32:33.190 --> 02:32:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:35.750 --> 02:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
dr sorensen
 
02:32:37.910 --> 02:32:37.920 align:start position:0%
i i don't i mean i thought
 
02:32:39.270 --> 02:32:39.280 align:start position:0%
representative merchant i thought that
 
02:32:41.349 --> 02:32:41.359 align:start position:0%
was a comment
 
02:32:43.030 --> 02:32:43.040 align:start position:0%
i understand the basis but was there a
 
02:32:44.550 --> 02:32:44.560 align:start position:0%
question i didn't hear a question
 
02:32:45.990 --> 02:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
just giving you a chance in case you
 
02:32:48.710 --> 02:32:48.720 align:start position:0%
wanted to respond
 
02:32:48.720 --> 02:32:49.670 align:start position:0%
wanted to respond
again

02:32:49.670 --> 02:32:49.680 align:start position:0%
again
 
02:32:49.680 --> 02:32:50.630 align:start position:0%
again
yeah

02:32:50.630 --> 02:32:50.640 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:32:52.950 --> 02:32:52.960 align:start position:0%
i think my testimony stands on that
 
02:32:54.950 --> 02:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
comment that's fine
 
02:32:57.429 --> 02:32:57.439 align:start position:0%
you know again i think there is i would
 
02:32:59.590 --> 02:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
i would expound that there is increasing
 
02:33:01.990 --> 02:33:02.000 align:start position:0%
consumerism there is certainly increased
 
02:33:03.670 --> 02:33:03.680 align:start position:0%
access to testing but that doesn't
 
02:33:05.830 --> 02:33:05.840 align:start position:0%
necessarily mean that it's a good thing
 
02:33:08.070 --> 02:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
and that we should widely open it up in
 
02:33:10.070 --> 02:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
our state just because it happens in
 
02:33:11.830 --> 02:33:11.840 align:start position:0%
other places
 
02:33:14.150 --> 02:33:14.160 align:start position:0%
thank you i guess
 
02:33:16.070 --> 02:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
yes uh
 
02:33:18.630 --> 02:33:18.640 align:start position:0%
representative woods
 
02:33:20.150 --> 02:33:20.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you dr
 
02:33:22.150 --> 02:33:22.160 align:start position:0%
sobelson for taking my question
 
02:33:25.270 --> 02:33:25.280 align:start position:0%
uh let's assume um a patient has gone to
 
02:33:26.950 --> 02:33:26.960 align:start position:0%
a direct to consumer
 
02:33:30.389 --> 02:33:30.399 align:start position:0%
lab uh got a lab study and it's uh uh
 
02:33:31.990 --> 02:33:32.000 align:start position:0%
determined by the patient this is
 
02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:33.429 align:start position:0%
determined by the patient this is
abnormal

02:33:33.429 --> 02:33:33.439 align:start position:0%
abnormal
 
02:33:36.309 --> 02:33:36.319 align:start position:0%
and they send it to your office
 
02:33:37.750 --> 02:33:37.760 align:start position:0%
although the bill
 
02:33:39.510 --> 02:33:39.520 align:start position:0%
uh as identified that you're not
 
02:33:39.520 --> 02:33:40.950 align:start position:0%
uh as identified that you're not
culpable

02:33:40.950 --> 02:33:40.960 align:start position:0%
culpable
 
02:33:43.110 --> 02:33:43.120 align:start position:0%
for acting on that once it reaches your
 
02:33:43.120 --> 02:33:44.309 align:start position:0%
for acting on that once it reaches your
office

02:33:44.309 --> 02:33:44.319 align:start position:0%
office
 
02:33:46.950 --> 02:33:46.960 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that once you're
 
02:33:49.590 --> 02:33:49.600 align:start position:0%
made aware of it you are indeed culpable
 
02:33:52.309 --> 02:33:52.319 align:start position:0%
is that your understanding
 
02:33:52.319 --> 02:33:53.190 align:start position:0%
is that your understanding
um

02:33:53.190 --> 02:33:53.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:33:55.510 --> 02:33:55.520 align:start position:0%
absolutely correct uh representative dr
 
02:33:58.550 --> 02:33:58.560 align:start position:0%
woods i i i think as we well know our
 
02:34:02.070 --> 02:34:02.080 align:start position:0%
responsibilities are um there
 
02:34:03.750 --> 02:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
are different levels of this but
 
02:34:05.750 --> 02:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
information and that is within our
 
02:34:07.429 --> 02:34:07.439 align:start position:0%
knowledge but we have we have a direct
 
02:34:09.590 --> 02:34:09.600 align:start position:0%
responsibility for the patient ignoring
 
02:34:11.830 --> 02:34:11.840 align:start position:0%
data that comes into us that we see
 
02:34:14.630 --> 02:34:14.640 align:start position:0%
would be professionally unresponsible i
 
02:34:16.630 --> 02:34:16.640 align:start position:0%
think our board of medicine would frown
 
02:34:19.030 --> 02:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
very strongly on that it would frankly
 
02:34:21.990 --> 02:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
be unethical um beyond whatever
 
02:34:24.630 --> 02:34:24.640 align:start position:0%
the legislature tries to state now
 
02:34:26.790 --> 02:34:26.800 align:start position:0%
whether what type of evidence is
 
02:34:28.550 --> 02:34:28.560 align:start position:0%
available in a court of law is way
 
02:34:31.429 --> 02:34:31.439 align:start position:0%
outside of my purview but but the most
 
02:34:32.950 --> 02:34:32.960 align:start position:0%
important point about this is that the
 
02:34:34.870 --> 02:34:34.880 align:start position:0%
kind of tests that we're talking about
 
02:34:37.510 --> 02:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
are the beginning point of what is often
 
02:34:37.520 --> 02:34:38.309 align:start position:0%
are the beginning point of what is often
of

02:34:38.309 --> 02:34:38.319 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:34:41.030 --> 02:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
much more information so the example of
 
02:34:42.950 --> 02:34:42.960 align:start position:0%
the a1c but which by the way i would
 
02:34:45.910 --> 02:34:45.920 align:start position:0%
support an a1c being available to a to a
 
02:34:48.150 --> 02:34:48.160 align:start position:0%
diabetic uh to know that i don't think
 
02:34:50.550 --> 02:34:50.560 align:start position:0%
there's very high risk there at all but
 
02:34:52.550 --> 02:34:52.560 align:start position:0%
the point is the a1c comes if i don't
 
02:34:55.270 --> 02:34:55.280 align:start position:0%
respond to it um and i don't contact the
 
02:34:56.550 --> 02:34:56.560 align:start position:0%
patient and say i see that you have an
 
02:34:58.630 --> 02:34:58.640 align:start position:0%
a1c of 10 and therefore your diabetes is
 
02:35:00.150 --> 02:35:00.160 align:start position:0%
important what are we going to do about
 
02:35:00.160 --> 02:35:00.950 align:start position:0%
important what are we going to do about
that

02:35:00.950 --> 02:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:35:03.670 --> 02:35:03.680 align:start position:0%
i would certainly be seen as liable and
 
02:35:03.680 --> 02:35:04.630 align:start position:0%
i would certainly be seen as liable and
under

02:35:04.630 --> 02:35:04.640 align:start position:0%
under
 
02:35:06.389 --> 02:35:06.399 align:start position:0%
our current standards of care
 
02:35:06.399 --> 02:35:07.190 align:start position:0%
our current standards of care
so

02:35:07.190 --> 02:35:07.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:35:08.550 --> 02:35:08.560 align:start position:0%
i don't see how the legislature can
 
02:35:10.790 --> 02:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
protect against information
 
02:35:13.830 --> 02:35:13.840 align:start position:0%
not being available as evidence perhaps
 
02:35:15.750 --> 02:35:15.760 align:start position:0%
in malpractice but what about the
 
02:35:19.990 --> 02:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:22.550 --> 02:35:22.560 align:start position:0%
representative gay thank you mr chairman
 
02:35:24.550 --> 02:35:24.560 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question
 
02:35:27.349 --> 02:35:27.359 align:start position:0%
if you do receive a no
 
02:35:28.790 --> 02:35:28.800 align:start position:0%
a test result
 
02:35:32.150 --> 02:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
say an a1c of 10 instead of 7
 
02:35:33.590 --> 02:35:33.600 align:start position:0%
below 7
 
02:35:35.429 --> 02:35:35.439 align:start position:0%
what is the problem
 
02:35:37.270 --> 02:35:37.280 align:start position:0%
if this is your patient
 
02:35:38.790 --> 02:35:38.800 align:start position:0%
and now you know
 
02:35:40.710 --> 02:35:40.720 align:start position:0%
and you can charge it's not a problem
 
02:35:43.910 --> 02:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
about charging telemedicine what is the
 
02:35:43.920 --> 02:35:45.830 align:start position:0%
about charging telemedicine what is the
problem

02:35:45.830 --> 02:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
problem
 
02:35:47.670 --> 02:35:47.680 align:start position:0%
well i i think we're we're picking the
 
02:35:49.670 --> 02:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
example that is probably the best
 
02:35:51.990 --> 02:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
example of something that might be a
 
02:35:54.710 --> 02:35:54.720 align:start position:0%
good test to segment out and have
 
02:35:56.630 --> 02:35:56.640 align:start position:0%
i'm available to diabetics much as home
 
02:35:58.309 --> 02:35:58.319 align:start position:0%
blood sugar testing by the way is but
 
02:36:01.190 --> 02:36:01.200 align:start position:0%
how about if a patient orders um a
 
02:36:03.110 --> 02:36:03.120 align:start position:0%
genetic uh panel
 
02:36:05.750 --> 02:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
that uh identity that that identifies
 
02:36:08.550 --> 02:36:08.560 align:start position:0%
him as having you know being at risk for
 
02:36:10.389 --> 02:36:10.399 align:start position:0%
a rare illness
 
02:36:12.790 --> 02:36:12.800 align:start position:0%
um now again there are companies that
 
02:36:14.870 --> 02:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
are that are doing that but
 
02:36:17.030 --> 02:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
does so now that information comes to me
 
02:36:19.190 --> 02:36:19.200 align:start position:0%
what what is my responsibility now what
 
02:36:21.110 --> 02:36:21.120 align:start position:0%
if i don't even have the expertise to
 
02:36:23.110 --> 02:36:23.120 align:start position:0%
interpret that test
 
02:36:26.389 --> 02:36:26.399 align:start position:0%
um and again i i think the the there are
 
02:36:28.630 --> 02:36:28.640 align:start position:0%
many many laboratory tests that even i
 
02:36:30.070 --> 02:36:30.080 align:start position:0%
as a family physician don't have the
 
02:36:31.590 --> 02:36:31.600 align:start position:0%
expertise to order and i shouldn't be
 
02:36:31.600 --> 02:36:33.030 align:start position:0%
expertise to order and i shouldn't be
working

02:36:33.030 --> 02:36:33.040 align:start position:0%
working
 
02:36:35.670 --> 02:36:35.680 align:start position:0%
so i think i think by picking the
 
02:36:38.389 --> 02:36:38.399 align:start position:0%
examples of things that perhaps there
 
02:36:41.429 --> 02:36:41.439 align:start position:0%
will be marketable tests in uh simple to
 
02:36:44.150 --> 02:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
interpret safe reliable
 
02:36:46.389 --> 02:36:46.399 align:start position:0%
um understandable tests
 
02:36:48.230 --> 02:36:48.240 align:start position:0%
and then opening that up to a blood
 
02:36:50.790 --> 02:36:50.800 align:start position:0%
panel which has 26
 
02:36:52.710 --> 02:36:52.720 align:start position:0%
values on it um almost always
 
02:36:54.230 --> 02:36:54.240 align:start position:0%
statistically people have slide errors
 
02:36:56.070 --> 02:36:56.080 align:start position:0%
on and now call me up
 
02:36:57.590 --> 02:36:57.600 align:start position:0%
to want to know what it all means well
 
02:37:00.309 --> 02:37:00.319 align:start position:0%
it doesn't mean anything um you know do
 
02:37:02.309 --> 02:37:02.319 align:start position:0%
i do i need a workup for my liver
 
02:37:05.190 --> 02:37:05.200 align:start position:0%
disease because my transaminase test was
 
02:37:08.550 --> 02:37:08.560 align:start position:0%
36 when the normal on this lab is 34.
 
02:37:10.790 --> 02:37:10.800 align:start position:0%
so it's really not a matter of charges
 
02:37:12.790 --> 02:37:12.800 align:start position:0%
it's a matter of doing unnecessary tests
 
02:37:14.790 --> 02:37:14.800 align:start position:0%
that lead to more unnecessary tests
 
02:37:17.030 --> 02:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
that's our greatest concern as a
 
02:37:17.040 --> 02:37:22.710 align:start position:0%
that's our greatest concern as a
exciting

02:37:22.710 --> 02:37:22.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:22.720 --> 02:37:25.830 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:37:25.830 --> 02:37:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:27.990 --> 02:37:28.000 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you dr sobelson i wanted
 
02:37:30.230 --> 02:37:30.240 align:start position:0%
to get back to that issue of the
 
02:37:32.230 --> 02:37:32.240 align:start position:0%
what we do see with that diagnostic
 
02:37:35.030 --> 02:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
cascade and particularly with the
 
02:37:36.389 --> 02:37:36.399 align:start position:0%
risks of
 
02:37:38.630 --> 02:37:38.640 align:start position:0%
screening tests which have may have a
 
02:37:40.790 --> 02:37:40.800 align:start position:0%
high false positivity rate or poor
 
02:37:43.830 --> 02:37:43.840 align:start position:0%
predictive value or serology tests where
 
02:37:45.670 --> 02:37:45.680 align:start position:0%
the implications aren't really what they
 
02:37:47.830 --> 02:37:47.840 align:start position:0%
might appear at first glance
 
02:37:50.389 --> 02:37:50.399 align:start position:0%
so do you think if we were going to pass
 
02:37:51.990 --> 02:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
such a bill as this
 
02:37:54.389 --> 02:37:54.399 align:start position:0%
um i mean well i should say given the
 
02:37:55.910 --> 02:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
fact that you know we go through four
 
02:37:57.429 --> 02:37:57.439 align:start position:0%
years of college four years of medical
 
02:37:59.510 --> 02:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
school three to six years of residency
 
02:38:01.429 --> 02:38:01.439 align:start position:0%
so we can interpret these do you think
 
02:38:04.070 --> 02:38:04.080 align:start position:0%
the patient with the assistance of dr
 
02:38:06.630 --> 02:38:06.640 align:start position:0%
google will have the ability to be able
 
02:38:10.230 --> 02:38:10.240 align:start position:0%
to sort these issues out themselves and
 
02:38:11.990 --> 02:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
should there be a disclaimer by the lab
 
02:38:13.670 --> 02:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
if such a bill went through
 
02:38:15.750 --> 02:38:15.760 align:start position:0%
to emphasize what the importance is the
 
02:38:18.469 --> 02:38:18.479 align:start position:0%
false negativity of any given test or
 
02:38:21.270 --> 02:38:21.280 align:start position:0%
its poor predictive value
 
02:38:23.349 --> 02:38:23.359 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean i i think i think your your
 
02:38:26.230 --> 02:38:26.240 align:start position:0%
preamble explains the problem that that
 
02:38:26.240 --> 02:38:27.030 align:start position:0%
preamble explains the problem that that
the

02:38:27.030 --> 02:38:27.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:38:29.910 --> 02:38:29.920 align:start position:0%
concept that this is in any way a simple
 
02:38:31.910 --> 02:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
and straightforward aspect of medical
 
02:38:34.150 --> 02:38:34.160 align:start position:0%
practice is a fallacy
 
02:38:37.670 --> 02:38:37.680 align:start position:0%
so um this is this is no this is far
 
02:38:39.270 --> 02:38:39.280 align:start position:0%
more challenging than the decision to
 
02:38:41.670 --> 02:38:41.680 align:start position:0%
prescribe antibiotics and yet we don't
 
02:38:43.590 --> 02:38:43.600 align:start position:0%
have people walking into pharmacies and
 
02:38:46.070 --> 02:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
getting antibiotics it's far more
 
02:38:48.990 --> 02:38:49.000 align:start position:0%
challenging than a great deal of the
 
02:38:51.349 --> 02:38:51.359 align:start position:0%
simple decision making that goes on in
 
02:38:52.870 --> 02:38:52.880 align:start position:0%
medicine it's actually one of the most
 
02:38:54.870 --> 02:38:54.880 align:start position:0%
complex aspects of decision making that
 
02:38:58.070 --> 02:38:58.080 align:start position:0%
we do is deciding what tests to order
 
02:38:59.670 --> 02:38:59.680 align:start position:0%
and then deciding what to do with that
 
02:38:59.680 --> 02:39:00.790 align:start position:0%
and then deciding what to do with that
information

02:39:00.790 --> 02:39:00.800 align:start position:0%
information
 
02:39:03.030 --> 02:39:03.040 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure a disclaimer takes me very
 
02:39:05.670 --> 02:39:05.680 align:start position:0%
far uh representative
 
02:39:08.710 --> 02:39:08.720 align:start position:0%
but uh um i i suspect that
 
02:39:10.550 --> 02:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
again those those are the lawyers lining
 
02:39:13.270 --> 02:39:13.280 align:start position:0%
up to sort of determine liability in in
 
02:39:15.830 --> 02:39:15.840 align:start position:0%
a certain very basic way my greater
 
02:39:18.309 --> 02:39:18.319 align:start position:0%
concern is what it says to our society
 
02:39:20.150 --> 02:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
on uh about
 
02:39:23.590 --> 02:39:23.600 align:start position:0%
the their their role in health care um
 
02:39:23.600 --> 02:39:24.630 align:start position:0%
the their their role in health care um
versus

02:39:24.630 --> 02:39:24.640 align:start position:0%
versus
 
02:39:26.950 --> 02:39:26.960 align:start position:0%
how important education becomes you know
 
02:39:28.630 --> 02:39:28.640 align:start position:0%
and again i think this reference to dr
 
02:39:30.790 --> 02:39:30.800 align:start position:0%
google is a good one um i think in our
 
02:39:34.070 --> 02:39:34.080 align:start position:0%
current in our current state withholding
 
02:39:36.230 --> 02:39:36.240 align:start position:0%
knowledge is a
 
02:39:37.990 --> 02:39:38.000 align:start position:0%
is not something that we really want to
 
02:39:39.990 --> 02:39:40.000 align:start position:0%
do on the other hand we really want
 
02:39:41.750 --> 02:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
people to be careful about how they use
 
02:39:44.070 --> 02:39:44.080 align:start position:0%
that knowledge and and this is an area
 
02:39:46.150 --> 02:39:46.160 align:start position:0%
where the state has some control
 
02:39:48.790 --> 02:39:48.800 align:start position:0%
obviously we can't control um the the
 
02:39:50.870 --> 02:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
misinformation that comes across the
 
02:39:53.110 --> 02:39:53.120 align:start position:0%
internet that at times puts people at
 
02:39:56.070 --> 02:39:56.080 align:start position:0%
risk but maybe we can control them not
 
02:39:58.150 --> 02:39:58.160 align:start position:0%
ordering their own tests and trying to
 
02:40:02.710 --> 02:40:02.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:04.630 --> 02:40:04.640 align:start position:0%
representative cushman
 
02:40:05.670 --> 02:40:05.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:40:07.670 --> 02:40:07.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
02:40:07.680 --> 02:40:08.710 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
um

02:40:08.710 --> 02:40:08.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:40:10.710 --> 02:40:10.720 align:start position:0%
my question is
 
02:40:13.830 --> 02:40:13.840 align:start position:0%
what is to stop um physicians if their
 
02:40:15.910 --> 02:40:15.920 align:start position:0%
patient orders gets tests ordered
 
02:40:15.920 --> 02:40:16.950 align:start position:0%
patient orders gets tests ordered
through

02:40:16.950 --> 02:40:16.960 align:start position:0%
through
 
02:40:19.830 --> 02:40:19.840 align:start position:0%
um a lab without the physician's order
 
02:40:22.070 --> 02:40:22.080 align:start position:0%
what is to stop the physician from
 
02:40:24.150 --> 02:40:24.160 align:start position:0%
explaining to the patient when the
 
02:40:26.389 --> 02:40:26.399 align:start position:0%
patient makes them aware of the results
 
02:40:27.830 --> 02:40:27.840 align:start position:0%
of this
 
02:40:30.150 --> 02:40:30.160 align:start position:0%
i don't have the expertise for that and
 
02:40:32.550 --> 02:40:32.560 align:start position:0%
then referring them or
 
02:40:34.950 --> 02:40:34.960 align:start position:0%
just simply explaining
 
02:40:36.309 --> 02:40:36.319 align:start position:0%
well this is what i know about the
 
02:40:38.469 --> 02:40:38.479 align:start position:0%
specificity of this test
 
02:40:38.479 --> 02:40:39.670 align:start position:0%
specificity of this test
and

02:40:39.670 --> 02:40:39.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:40:41.830 --> 02:40:41.840 align:start position:0%
is there something that will prevent a
 
02:40:45.910 --> 02:40:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:47.990 --> 02:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely not i think physicians could
 
02:40:50.150 --> 02:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
make their own determination if if you
 
02:40:52.630 --> 02:40:52.640 align:start position:0%
pass a bill of this sort uh the medical
 
02:40:55.190 --> 02:40:55.200 align:start position:0%
system will have to find a way to adapt
 
02:40:55.200 --> 02:40:56.309 align:start position:0%
system will have to find a way to adapt
to

02:40:56.309 --> 02:40:56.319 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:40:58.790 --> 02:40:58.800 align:start position:0%
um a consumer-driven testing model i
 
02:41:01.429 --> 02:41:01.439 align:start position:0%
guess i mean we and we will do so um you
 
02:41:02.870 --> 02:41:02.880 align:start position:0%
know we're not going to abandon our
 
02:41:04.870 --> 02:41:04.880 align:start position:0%
patients uh just because they come at us
 
02:41:07.670 --> 02:41:07.680 align:start position:0%
with data um i guess what i what our
 
02:41:10.309 --> 02:41:10.319 align:start position:0%
society is trying to say to you all is
 
02:41:12.550 --> 02:41:12.560 align:start position:0%
that this is not going to enhance the
 
02:41:14.950 --> 02:41:14.960 align:start position:0%
care of this of the of the citizens of
 
02:41:17.190 --> 02:41:17.200 align:start position:0%
new hampshire it's probably going to
 
02:41:20.870 --> 02:41:20.880 align:start position:0%
increase the risk of increased cost and
 
02:41:22.870 --> 02:41:22.880 align:start position:0%
an adverse outcome
 
02:41:27.750 --> 02:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:27.760 --> 02:41:29.190 align:start position:0%
 
following

02:41:29.190 --> 02:41:29.200 align:start position:0%
following
 
02:41:32.469 --> 02:41:32.479 align:start position:0%
um well what what do you think about
 
02:41:34.630 --> 02:41:34.640 align:start position:0%
um so many cases that we hear about that
 
02:41:36.550 --> 02:41:36.560 align:start position:0%
i see as a nurse and
 
02:41:39.270 --> 02:41:39.280 align:start position:0%
also um where patients ask
 
02:41:40.950 --> 02:41:40.960 align:start position:0%
and and bring a problem to their
 
02:41:43.590 --> 02:41:43.600 align:start position:0%
physician and ask for you know what
 
02:41:44.870 --> 02:41:44.880 align:start position:0%
should be done
 
02:41:46.950 --> 02:41:46.960 align:start position:0%
and only to be
 
02:41:49.910 --> 02:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
uh have their issue minimized and say oh
 
02:41:51.590 --> 02:41:51.600 align:start position:0%
well it's nothing
 
02:41:54.389 --> 02:41:54.399 align:start position:0%
and then the patient goes and luckily we
 
02:41:54.399 --> 02:41:55.670 align:start position:0%
and then the patient goes and luckily we
have

02:41:55.670 --> 02:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:41:57.110 --> 02:41:57.120 align:start position:0%
the world's information at our
 
02:42:00.790 --> 02:42:00.800 align:start position:0%
fingertips and the patient finds
 
02:42:02.950 --> 02:42:02.960 align:start position:0%
something to go off of and goes to a
 
02:42:05.030 --> 02:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
different doctor and says can you order
 
02:42:06.230 --> 02:42:06.240 align:start position:0%
this lab
 
02:42:09.750 --> 02:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
and or or goes to an independent lab
 
02:42:11.910 --> 02:42:11.920 align:start position:0%
that is serviced through another state
 
02:42:13.750 --> 02:42:13.760 align:start position:0%
and then they find that they they are
 
02:42:16.309 --> 02:42:16.319 align:start position:0%
they do have a diagnosis that was missed
 
02:42:17.670 --> 02:42:17.680 align:start position:0%
by the doctor
 
02:42:19.590 --> 02:42:19.600 align:start position:0%
don't you think that this bill could
 
02:42:21.429 --> 02:42:21.439 align:start position:0%
help solve some of those
 
02:42:21.439 --> 02:42:24.070 align:start position:0%
help solve some of those
misdiagnoses

02:42:24.070 --> 02:42:24.080 align:start position:0%
misdiagnoses
 
02:42:26.469 --> 02:42:26.479 align:start position:0%
um respectfully i suspect that that
 
02:42:29.429 --> 02:42:29.439 align:start position:0%
problem is a is an unusual problem but
 
02:42:29.439 --> 02:42:30.150 align:start position:0%
problem is a is an unusual problem but
you

02:42:30.150 --> 02:42:30.160 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:42:32.230 --> 02:42:32.240 align:start position:0%
you've also described how it often gets
 
02:42:34.309 --> 02:42:34.319 align:start position:0%
solved is that people make the decision
 
02:42:37.110 --> 02:42:37.120 align:start position:0%
to seek other expertise um they
 
02:42:38.870 --> 02:42:38.880 align:start position:0%
generally don't solve the problem by
 
02:42:40.469 --> 02:42:40.479 align:start position:0%
ordering their own test
 
02:42:43.190 --> 02:42:43.200 align:start position:0%
um and and as what i tried to point out
 
02:42:45.670 --> 02:42:45.680 align:start position:0%
in my testimony was that i think the the
 
02:42:47.750 --> 02:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
greater risk of this is that you'll have
 
02:42:49.670 --> 02:42:49.680 align:start position:0%
more misdiagnosis
 
02:42:51.750 --> 02:42:51.760 align:start position:0%
um so that
 
02:42:55.190 --> 02:42:55.200 align:start position:0%
again increasing access to some sorts of
 
02:42:57.510 --> 02:42:57.520 align:start position:0%
data by people who are not trained to
 
02:42:59.349 --> 02:42:59.359 align:start position:0%
interpret that data that being the
 
02:43:02.070 --> 02:43:02.080 align:start position:0%
general citizenry um could probably
 
02:43:04.550 --> 02:43:04.560 align:start position:0%
increase the risk i mean i suspect there
 
02:43:06.950 --> 02:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
are people who who uh
 
02:43:08.389 --> 02:43:08.399 align:start position:0%
you know uh
 
02:43:09.910 --> 02:43:09.920 align:start position:0%
i mean we don't let people without
 
02:43:11.429 --> 02:43:11.439 align:start position:0%
driver's license drive i suspect
 
02:43:13.750 --> 02:43:13.760 align:start position:0%
sometimes they could avert
 
02:43:16.389 --> 02:43:16.399 align:start position:0%
uh you know bad something bad happens to
 
02:43:17.910 --> 02:43:17.920 align:start position:0%
them if they could drive somewhere but
 
02:43:19.590 --> 02:43:19.600 align:start position:0%
we're recognizing the
 
02:43:21.190 --> 02:43:21.200 align:start position:0%
that there are risks associated with
 
02:43:23.910 --> 02:43:23.920 align:start position:0%
those limited benefits and uh and i and
 
02:43:26.070 --> 02:43:26.080 align:start position:0%
i think the benefits are quite limited
 
02:43:27.670 --> 02:43:27.680 align:start position:0%
in the in the situation when you're
 
02:43:27.680 --> 02:43:28.630 align:start position:0%

turn your

02:43:57.429 --> 02:43:57.439 align:start position:0%
if we have people who are
 
02:43:59.990 --> 02:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
uh getting tests and then sending them
 
02:44:02.870 --> 02:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
to the doctor who then needs to either
 
02:44:05.269 --> 02:44:05.279 align:start position:0%
retest further test or
 
02:44:08.389 --> 02:44:08.399 align:start position:0%
refer to other folks for
 
02:44:11.349 --> 02:44:11.359 align:start position:0%
confirmation that this is not in fact an
 
02:44:15.190 --> 02:44:15.200 align:start position:0%
issue that is of true concern uh does
 
02:44:17.830 --> 02:44:17.840 align:start position:0%
that risk driving up the cost of medical
 
02:44:21.349 --> 02:44:21.359 align:start position:0%
insurance for the general population
 
02:44:23.990 --> 02:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
i i i believe that that was my st one of
 
02:44:26.150 --> 02:44:26.160 align:start position:0%
my comments uh because i saw in this
 
02:44:27.910 --> 02:44:27.920 align:start position:0%
bill it did not seem to have a fiscal
 
02:44:30.710 --> 02:44:30.720 align:start position:0%
note attached to it um i believe it does
 
02:44:32.469 --> 02:44:32.479 align:start position:0%
and there are examples of that already
 
02:44:34.790 --> 02:44:34.800 align:start position:0%
um now there's a
 
02:44:36.870 --> 02:44:36.880 align:start position:0%
program called lifeline that many of you
 
02:44:38.870 --> 02:44:38.880 align:start position:0%
probably have gotten the mailings from
 
02:44:40.710 --> 02:44:40.720 align:start position:0%
now this is not patient driven this is
 
02:44:42.389 --> 02:44:42.399 align:start position:0%
actually a medical there are doctors
 
02:44:44.389 --> 02:44:44.399 align:start position:0%
behind that project but they're not your
 
02:44:46.070 --> 02:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
doctors and their doctor is making a
 
02:44:49.510 --> 02:44:49.520 align:start position:0%
profit but but they order tests
 
02:44:51.510 --> 02:44:51.520 align:start position:0%
and then the lifeline report comes to me
 
02:44:52.710 --> 02:44:52.720 align:start position:0%
and i'll tell you that when you test a
 
02:44:53.670 --> 02:44:53.680 align:start position:0%
lot of
 
02:44:55.990 --> 02:44:56.000 align:start position:0%
people over the age of 60 looking for
 
02:44:58.950 --> 02:44:58.960 align:start position:0%
let's say carotid disease
 
02:45:02.950 --> 02:45:02.960 align:start position:0%
um a a a disease state which the uh that
 
02:45:04.389 --> 02:45:04.399 align:start position:0%
expert groups in the united states have
 
02:45:06.150 --> 02:45:06.160 align:start position:0%
said you should not be screening people
 
02:45:09.590 --> 02:45:09.600 align:start position:0%
for that that that early early disease
 
02:45:11.910 --> 02:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
inter finding early disease is
 
02:45:13.750 --> 02:45:13.760 align:start position:0%
not valuable well lifeline finds this
 
02:45:15.429 --> 02:45:15.439 align:start position:0%
all the time and now a patient comes to
 
02:45:17.830 --> 02:45:17.840 align:start position:0%
me and says you know i've got a they
 
02:45:19.269 --> 02:45:19.279 align:start position:0%
tell me i may have a blockage of my
 
02:45:20.710 --> 02:45:20.720 align:start position:0%
carotid you better do some additional
 
02:45:23.349 --> 02:45:23.359 align:start position:0%
tests now not only does that does that
 
02:45:25.910 --> 02:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
lead to very expensive follow-up testing
 
02:45:27.910 --> 02:45:27.920 align:start position:0%
it leads to testing that puts your life
 
02:45:28.950 --> 02:45:28.960 align:start position:0%
at risk
 
02:45:31.750 --> 02:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
and and in fact the expert groups that
 
02:45:32.870 --> 02:45:32.880 align:start position:0%
have studied this have said that we
 
02:45:34.150 --> 02:45:34.160 align:start position:0%
shouldn't that those tests shouldn't
 
02:45:35.190 --> 02:45:35.200 align:start position:0%
have been done in the first place and
 
02:45:37.269 --> 02:45:37.279 align:start position:0%
the only way to avoid that so that's an
 
02:45:40.070 --> 02:45:40.080 align:start position:0%
example now again the average person
 
02:45:41.429 --> 02:45:41.439 align:start position:0%
looks at that and says well if i have
 
02:45:43.349 --> 02:45:43.359 align:start position:0%
early carotid disease i'd sure like to
 
02:45:45.269 --> 02:45:45.279 align:start position:0%
know because maybe it'll stop me from
 
02:45:46.790 --> 02:45:46.800 align:start position:0%
having a stroke
 
02:45:48.389 --> 02:45:48.399 align:start position:0%
well the trouble is that the
 
02:45:50.469 --> 02:45:50.479 align:start position:0%
interventions that we're going to follow
 
02:45:52.150 --> 02:45:52.160 align:start position:0%
through from that test might be of
 
02:45:53.990 --> 02:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
greater risk to you than the benefit and
 
02:45:56.389 --> 02:45:56.399 align:start position:0%
in fact that's the evidence
 
02:45:58.790 --> 02:45:58.800 align:start position:0%
it's not this is the more is not better
 
02:46:01.510 --> 02:46:01.520 align:start position:0%
question in american medicine and
 
02:46:03.269 --> 02:46:03.279 align:start position:0%
and those of us who practice preventive
 
02:46:05.429 --> 02:46:05.439 align:start position:0%
medicine are in the system have really
 
02:46:07.429 --> 02:46:07.439 align:start position:0%
come to understand that
 
02:46:09.030 --> 02:46:09.040 align:start position:0%
and again
 
02:46:10.630 --> 02:46:10.640 align:start position:0%
the kind of data we're talking about
 
02:46:12.710 --> 02:46:12.720 align:start position:0%
creating with this bill will contribute
 
02:46:15.190 --> 02:46:15.200 align:start position:0%
to that will contribute to the cost but
 
02:46:16.790 --> 02:46:16.800 align:start position:0%
also will contribute significantly to
 
02:46:16.800 --> 02:46:18.710 align:start position:0%
also will contribute significantly to
risk

02:46:18.710 --> 02:46:18.720 align:start position:0%
risk
 
02:46:20.309 --> 02:46:20.319 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:46:23.269 --> 02:46:23.279 align:start position:0%
representative merchant
 
02:46:24.790 --> 02:46:24.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you dr
 
02:46:24.800 --> 02:46:26.070 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you dr
sobelson

02:46:26.070 --> 02:46:26.080 align:start position:0%
sobelson
 
02:46:26.080 --> 02:46:27.429 align:start position:0%
sobelson
um

02:46:27.429 --> 02:46:27.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:46:30.070 --> 02:46:30.080 align:start position:0%
in regards to the laboratory work we've
 
02:46:33.110 --> 02:46:33.120 align:start position:0%
been talking about diagnostic work
 
02:46:35.030 --> 02:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
a lot of the lab work that i've seen has
 
02:46:37.510 --> 02:46:37.520 align:start position:0%
been more to monitor a clinical outcome
 
02:46:39.429 --> 02:46:39.439 align:start position:0%
or improvement and so forth not strictly
 
02:46:41.510 --> 02:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
to diagnose the patient so what i'm
 
02:46:43.830 --> 02:46:43.840 align:start position:0%
trying to ask a question to you is is
 
02:46:45.269 --> 02:46:45.279 align:start position:0%
there a reasonable compromise here
 
02:46:46.950 --> 02:46:46.960 align:start position:0%
saying that if the patient's been
 
02:46:49.190 --> 02:46:49.200 align:start position:0%
diagnosed and has a diagnosis
 
02:46:51.429 --> 02:46:51.439 align:start position:0%
whether it be diabetes and so forth that
 
02:46:53.429 --> 02:46:53.439 align:start position:0%
they could in fact order
 
02:46:55.510 --> 02:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
a1c or some other
 
02:46:57.349 --> 02:46:57.359 align:start position:0%
lab work that's going to help them
 
02:46:59.670 --> 02:46:59.680 align:start position:0%
monitor their therapy and achieve the
 
02:47:01.110 --> 02:47:01.120 align:start position:0%
outcome the clinician wants them to
 
02:47:03.590 --> 02:47:03.600 align:start position:0%
achieve it doesn't have to do with
 
02:47:05.990 --> 02:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
diagnosing an issue but monitoring a
 
02:47:07.830 --> 02:47:07.840 align:start position:0%
clinical outcome or trying to get to an
 
02:47:09.030 --> 02:47:09.040 align:start position:0%
outcome would that be a reasonable
 
02:47:09.040 --> 02:47:12.309 align:start position:0%
outcome would that be a reasonable
compromise

02:47:12.309 --> 02:47:12.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:13.830 --> 02:47:13.840 align:start position:0%
again i think that comes back in my
 
02:47:15.830 --> 02:47:15.840 align:start position:0%
testimony representative merchant to the
 
02:47:17.990 --> 02:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
idea of being specific and limited its
 
02:47:20.309 --> 02:47:20.319 align:start position:0%
scope so your example of an a1c is a
 
02:47:21.670 --> 02:47:21.680 align:start position:0%
good one i mean
 
02:47:23.590 --> 02:47:23.600 align:start position:0%
frankly i'm i'm surprised there isn't a
 
02:47:25.590 --> 02:47:25.600 align:start position:0%
commercial home test for a1c there
 
02:47:27.269 --> 02:47:27.279 align:start position:0%
probably should be it may be that it's
 
02:47:29.349 --> 02:47:29.359 align:start position:0%
harder to perform
 
02:47:30.950 --> 02:47:30.960 align:start position:0%
than i'm guessing because that would be
 
02:47:33.190 --> 02:47:33.200 align:start position:0%
a good example of a limited focus very
 
02:47:34.870 --> 02:47:34.880 align:start position:0%
useful test for someone to be able to
 
02:47:36.070 --> 02:47:36.080 align:start position:0%
monitor on their own much as people do
 
02:47:38.150 --> 02:47:38.160 align:start position:0%
their own blood sugars the trouble with
 
02:47:39.590 --> 02:47:39.600 align:start position:0%
just talking about monitoring a
 
02:47:42.150 --> 02:47:42.160 align:start position:0%
diagnosis is that again it opens up a
 
02:47:45.030 --> 02:47:45.040 align:start position:0%
very deep pandora's box of diagnosis
 
02:47:46.710 --> 02:47:46.720 align:start position:0%
if i have lymphoma should i be able to
 
02:47:50.230 --> 02:47:50.240 align:start position:0%
monitor my cbc's and monitor my my blood
 
02:47:50.240 --> 02:47:51.110 align:start position:0%
monitor my cbc's and monitor my my blood
work

02:47:51.110 --> 02:47:51.120 align:start position:0%
work
 
02:47:53.830 --> 02:47:53.840 align:start position:0%
if i'm on chemotherapy um or if i'm not
 
02:47:56.150 --> 02:47:56.160 align:start position:0%
on chemotherapy um i don't know if i
 
02:47:58.469 --> 02:47:58.479 align:start position:0%
have lupus should i be able to monitor
 
02:48:00.389 --> 02:48:00.399 align:start position:0%
the very complex
 
02:48:02.309 --> 02:48:02.319 align:start position:0%
medical tests that are available to
 
02:48:04.230 --> 02:48:04.240 align:start position:0%
people like that so i think that's where
 
02:48:06.469 --> 02:48:06.479 align:start position:0%
you have to kind of go to standards of
 
02:48:06.479 --> 02:48:07.349 align:start position:0%
you have to kind of go to standards of
care

02:48:07.349 --> 02:48:07.359 align:start position:0%
care
 
02:48:10.550 --> 02:48:10.560 align:start position:0%
by specialists in in particular groups
 
02:48:12.950 --> 02:48:12.960 align:start position:0%
and and it's why in fact many of us
 
02:48:16.309 --> 02:48:16.319 align:start position:0%
support um consumer-driven approaches in
 
02:48:18.950 --> 02:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
diagnosis like diabetes but probably
 
02:48:21.510 --> 02:48:21.520 align:start position:0%
wouldn't when it comes to cancer
 
02:48:23.670 --> 02:48:23.680 align:start position:0%
um you're dealing with an entirely
 
02:48:26.230 --> 02:48:26.240 align:start position:0%
different scope of testing and so i
 
02:48:28.230 --> 02:48:28.240 align:start position:0%
think your compromise again speaks to
 
02:48:30.389 --> 02:48:30.399 align:start position:0%
the importance of having limited testing
 
02:48:31.990 --> 02:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
that's thought about and that's what the
 
02:48:33.269 --> 02:48:33.279 align:start position:0%
fda does
 
02:48:34.630 --> 02:48:34.640 align:start position:0%
with this with with a lot because
 
02:48:35.990 --> 02:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
there's a great deal of commercial
 
02:48:37.750 --> 02:48:37.760 align:start position:0%
interest in what you're talking about
 
02:48:39.590 --> 02:48:39.600 align:start position:0%
but i i don't see how you can manage
 
02:48:42.630 --> 02:48:42.640 align:start position:0%
that with regard to routine laboratories
 
02:48:42.640 --> 02:48:44.150 align:start position:0%
that with regard to routine laboratories
pathologies

02:48:44.150 --> 02:48:44.160 align:start position:0%
pathologies
 
02:48:46.630 --> 02:48:46.640 align:start position:0%
specimens and blood work in our in our
 
02:48:46.640 --> 02:48:49.590 align:start position:0%
specimens and blood work in our in our
side

02:48:49.590 --> 02:48:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:52.150 --> 02:48:52.160 align:start position:0%
mr chairman let me follow up please
 
02:48:54.870 --> 02:48:54.880 align:start position:0%
follow up yes thank you dr simpleton
 
02:48:54.880 --> 02:48:56.230 align:start position:0%
follow up yes thank you dr simpleton
um

02:48:56.230 --> 02:48:56.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:48:58.150 --> 02:48:58.160 align:start position:0%
give an example of something it doesn't
 
02:49:00.389 --> 02:49:00.399 align:start position:0%
do with blood sugar but
 
02:49:03.030 --> 02:49:03.040 align:start position:0%
i have a family member who has to go to
 
02:49:04.550 --> 02:49:04.560 align:start position:0%
a position to
 
02:49:06.790 --> 02:49:06.800 align:start position:0%
basically get a potassium level done
 
02:49:06.800 --> 02:49:07.750 align:start position:0%
basically get a potassium level done
um

02:49:07.750 --> 02:49:07.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:49:09.990 --> 02:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
right now it's an inconvenience they
 
02:49:11.750 --> 02:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
know it but every single time they want
 
02:49:13.910 --> 02:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
it done they have to go to the lab
 
02:49:15.269 --> 02:49:15.279 align:start position:0%
by the position
 
02:49:17.429 --> 02:49:17.439 align:start position:0%
and what i get to is there's
 
02:49:19.910 --> 02:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
it's not just a1c this cholesterol is
 
02:49:19.920 --> 02:49:21.349 align:start position:0%
it's not just a1c this cholesterol is
other

02:49:21.349 --> 02:49:21.359 align:start position:0%
other
 
02:49:23.429 --> 02:49:23.439 align:start position:0%
lab tests that can be done
 
02:49:25.830 --> 02:49:25.840 align:start position:0%
that are i think open to helping the
 
02:49:27.510 --> 02:49:27.520 align:start position:0%
patient would we should be trying to
 
02:49:29.990 --> 02:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
teach the patient to manage the care
 
02:49:32.630 --> 02:49:32.640 align:start position:0%
and not constantly go back to themselves
 
02:49:34.389 --> 02:49:34.399 align:start position:0%
it goes back to the analogy to teach
 
02:49:36.389 --> 02:49:36.399 align:start position:0%
somebody how to fish versus fishing for
 
02:49:38.389 --> 02:49:38.399 align:start position:0%
them and i'm trying to get that fine
 
02:49:39.830 --> 02:49:39.840 align:start position:0%
line and saying how do we help the
 
02:49:42.070 --> 02:49:42.080 align:start position:0%
patient become a caregiver of their own
 
02:49:43.910 --> 02:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
care versus everything having to go
 
02:49:45.510 --> 02:49:45.520 align:start position:0%
through the physician because not
 
02:49:46.710 --> 02:49:46.720 align:start position:0%
everything has to go through the
 
02:49:47.830 --> 02:49:47.840 align:start position:0%
physician sure to go through the
 
02:49:49.510 --> 02:49:49.520 align:start position:0%
position and i'm trying to find that
 
02:49:51.030 --> 02:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
middle ground and saying how do we help
 
02:49:54.870 --> 02:49:54.880 align:start position:0%
the patient care for themselves
 
02:49:57.190 --> 02:49:57.200 align:start position:0%
again i i'd respond representative
 
02:49:59.670 --> 02:49:59.680 align:start position:0%
merchant very respectfully i agree with
 
02:50:01.190 --> 02:50:01.200 align:start position:0%
great deal the philosophy you're
 
02:50:03.750 --> 02:50:03.760 align:start position:0%
bringing forth but the example's
 
02:50:06.309 --> 02:50:06.319 align:start position:0%
a good one so a serum potassium
 
02:50:09.030 --> 02:50:09.040 align:start position:0%
a seemingly simple test is an extremely
 
02:50:11.030 --> 02:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
complex bit of pathophysiology is it
 
02:50:13.510 --> 02:50:13.520 align:start position:0%
renal is it is it medication problems is
 
02:50:17.910 --> 02:50:17.920 align:start position:0%
it because um is it nutritional so um so
 
02:50:21.590 --> 02:50:21.600 align:start position:0%
that is a test that has no standard for
 
02:50:23.030 --> 02:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
following it you have to know what
 
02:50:25.510 --> 02:50:25.520 align:start position:0%
you're following um and again
 
02:50:27.429 --> 02:50:27.439 align:start position:0%
a patient shouldn't be self-managing
 
02:50:29.349 --> 02:50:29.359 align:start position:0%
their potassium there's way too much
 
02:50:30.950 --> 02:50:30.960 align:start position:0%
knowledge and and i think what you're
 
02:50:30.960 --> 02:50:32.230 align:start position:0%
knowledge and and i think what you're
describing

02:50:32.230 --> 02:50:32.240 align:start position:0%
describing
 
02:50:35.349 --> 02:50:35.359 align:start position:0%
um i think very virtuously is that there
 
02:50:37.670 --> 02:50:37.680 align:start position:0%
are conditions that patients can do a
 
02:50:39.510 --> 02:50:39.520 align:start position:0%
lot of self-management on and in those
 
02:50:42.070 --> 02:50:42.080 align:start position:0%
situations we should find ways to make
 
02:50:44.950 --> 02:50:44.960 align:start position:0%
it as inexpensive and easy for them
 
02:50:47.590 --> 02:50:47.600 align:start position:0%
to do that and i fully support that but
 
02:50:48.950 --> 02:50:48.960 align:start position:0%
i don't think this bill really does that
 
02:50:50.630 --> 02:50:50.640 align:start position:0%
i think this bill kind of opens up a
 
02:50:53.670 --> 02:50:53.680 align:start position:0%
wide a wide array and i'm not sure how
 
02:50:55.269 --> 02:50:55.279 align:start position:0%
you can narrow it down without being
 
02:50:57.670 --> 02:50:57.680 align:start position:0%
very specific about specific tests and
 
02:50:58.950 --> 02:50:58.960 align:start position:0%
that's and that's i guess where i would
 
02:51:01.429 --> 02:51:01.439 align:start position:0%
end my and my thoughts about that um i
 
02:51:02.950 --> 02:51:02.960 align:start position:0%
think we could
 
02:51:05.110 --> 02:51:05.120 align:start position:0%
agree about a few additional specific
 
02:51:07.030 --> 02:51:07.040 align:start position:0%
tests but i don't think that we would
 
02:51:08.870 --> 02:51:08.880 align:start position:0%
agree that a electrolytes or serum
 
02:51:11.429 --> 02:51:11.439 align:start position:0%
potassium would be a good choice
 
02:51:13.030 --> 02:51:13.040 align:start position:0%
we would say that takes an awful lot of
 
02:51:17.349 --> 02:51:17.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:20.150 --> 02:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
representative nelson
 
02:51:20.160 --> 02:51:20.950 align:start position:0%
representative nelson
yes

02:51:20.950 --> 02:51:20.960 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:51:23.269 --> 02:51:23.279 align:start position:0%
yes chairman thank you for taking this
 
02:51:25.510 --> 02:51:25.520 align:start position:0%
question if somebody just watch goes
 
02:51:27.670 --> 02:51:27.680 align:start position:0%
into a lab in a hospital
 
02:51:29.670 --> 02:51:29.680 align:start position:0%
and they want a certain test
 
02:51:31.670 --> 02:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
for free
 
02:51:35.110 --> 02:51:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:36.790 --> 02:51:36.800 align:start position:0%
i'm not an expert in this area but i'm
 
02:51:38.870 --> 02:51:38.880 align:start position:0%
pretty sure i could say no to that one
 
02:51:40.550 --> 02:51:40.560 align:start position:0%
but on two fronts one is i don't think
 
02:51:41.990 --> 02:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
you could walk into a hospital lab and
 
02:51:43.429 --> 02:51:43.439 align:start position:0%
order your own test
 
02:51:45.590 --> 02:51:45.600 align:start position:0%
any hospital in our state and secondly
 
02:51:47.030 --> 02:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
i'm pretty sure
 
02:51:49.910 --> 02:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:51.510 --> 02:51:51.520 align:start position:0%
you can
 
02:52:00.150 --> 02:52:00.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:02.469 --> 02:52:02.479 align:start position:0%
representative snow
 
02:52:02.479 --> 02:52:03.510 align:start position:0%
representative snow
yes

02:52:03.510 --> 02:52:03.520 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:52:08.389 --> 02:52:08.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:10.469 --> 02:52:10.479 align:start position:0%
thank you uh mr chairman and thank you
 
02:52:12.389 --> 02:52:12.399 align:start position:0%
for taking my question dr sobel said
 
02:52:14.550 --> 02:52:14.560 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be smarter if
 
02:52:17.910 --> 02:52:17.920 align:start position:0%
looking at the bill lines 16 through 20
 
02:52:19.030 --> 02:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
it really says
 
02:52:22.070 --> 02:52:22.080 align:start position:0%
the physician is no risk no obligation
 
02:52:23.910 --> 02:52:23.920 align:start position:0%
to respond to laboratory tests that he
 
02:52:26.309 --> 02:52:26.319 align:start position:0%
didn't order and that they have no
 
02:52:26.319 --> 02:52:27.590 align:start position:0%
didn't order and that they have no
uh

02:52:27.590 --> 02:52:27.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:52:29.750 --> 02:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
not subject to any liability a
 
02:52:32.150 --> 02:52:32.160 align:start position:0%
disorder if they do but if people
 
02:52:34.070 --> 02:52:34.080 align:start position:0%
did have a relationship with a physician
 
02:52:35.830 --> 02:52:35.840 align:start position:0%
such as yourself
 
02:52:38.309 --> 02:52:38.319 align:start position:0%
can't they request
 
02:52:41.910 --> 02:52:41.920 align:start position:0%
routine i i get uh coumadin levels tests
 
02:52:43.910 --> 02:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
whatever they call that test
 
02:52:46.710 --> 02:52:46.720 align:start position:0%
and i get a year-long order from a lab i
 
02:52:48.230 --> 02:52:48.240 align:start position:0%
go down with the intervals that they
 
02:52:50.950 --> 02:52:50.960 align:start position:0%
want to go to and the insurance then
 
02:52:52.870 --> 02:52:52.880 align:start position:0%
pays for it however if i went had those
 
02:52:54.950 --> 02:52:54.960 align:start position:0%
tests done on my own i'd have to pour it
 
02:52:56.870 --> 02:52:56.880 align:start position:0%
out of pocket each time i did it
 
02:52:59.510 --> 02:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it wouldn't this
 
02:53:01.110 --> 02:53:01.120 align:start position:0%
responsibility if somebody goes on their
 
02:53:03.349 --> 02:53:03.359 align:start position:0%
own it would bring on unnecessary costs
 
02:53:05.190 --> 02:53:05.200 align:start position:0%
they could be avoided by simply having a
 
02:53:07.030 --> 02:53:07.040 align:start position:0%
responsible relationship with a
 
02:53:09.269 --> 02:53:09.279 align:start position:0%
physician that could order tests
 
02:53:11.349 --> 02:53:11.359 align:start position:0%
periodically without necessarily having
 
02:53:12.950 --> 02:53:12.960 align:start position:0%
another appointment
 
02:53:12.960 --> 02:53:13.750 align:start position:0%
another appointment
the

02:53:13.750 --> 02:53:13.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:53:15.429 --> 02:53:15.439 align:start position:0%
doctor's office just calls me back and
 
02:53:16.950 --> 02:53:16.960 align:start position:0%
says your level is fine do the same
 
02:53:18.230 --> 02:53:18.240 align:start position:0%
thing next month
 
02:53:18.240 --> 02:53:19.030 align:start position:0%
thing next month
uh

02:53:19.030 --> 02:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:53:20.950 --> 02:53:20.960 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that be a much smarter move and
 
02:53:22.389 --> 02:53:22.399 align:start position:0%
we makes this
 
02:53:25.030 --> 02:53:25.040 align:start position:0%
bill sort of unnecessary except in very
 
02:53:27.990 --> 02:53:28.000 align:start position:0%
unusual circumstances such as what uh
 
02:53:29.910 --> 02:53:29.920 align:start position:0%
representative edwards talked about
 
02:53:31.349 --> 02:53:31.359 align:start position:0%
where they just didn't have a
 
02:53:33.830 --> 02:53:33.840 align:start position:0%
relationship with a physician
 
02:53:36.309 --> 02:53:36.319 align:start position:0%
i mean isn't isn't this
 
02:53:39.670 --> 02:53:39.680 align:start position:0%
only necessary in the most
 
02:53:43.830 --> 02:53:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:46.630 --> 02:53:46.640 align:start position:0%
well i i would i would agree with
 
02:53:48.469 --> 02:53:48.479 align:start position:0%
everything you said representatives know
 
02:53:50.389 --> 02:53:50.399 align:start position:0%
so i agree and i think your example of
 
02:53:53.110 --> 02:53:53.120 align:start position:0%
how physicians try to make testing
 
02:53:55.510 --> 02:53:55.520 align:start position:0%
accessible and low cost is is part of
 
02:53:57.030 --> 02:53:57.040 align:start position:0%
the point
 
02:53:58.790 --> 02:53:58.800 align:start position:0%
i don't think that's the intent of this
 
02:54:00.070 --> 02:54:00.080 align:start position:0%
legislation the intent of this
 
02:54:03.670 --> 02:54:03.680 align:start position:0%
legislation is i think as as presented
 
02:54:07.030 --> 02:54:07.040 align:start position:0%
is to in fact bypass physician and nurse
 
02:54:09.510 --> 02:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
practitioner and pa
 
02:54:12.230 --> 02:54:12.240 align:start position:0%
control over this and make it a consumer
 
02:54:12.240 --> 02:54:13.269 align:start position:0%
control over this and make it a consumer
activity

02:54:13.269 --> 02:54:13.279 align:start position:0%
activity
 
02:54:14.790 --> 02:54:14.800 align:start position:0%
and again
 
02:54:16.870 --> 02:54:16.880 align:start position:0%
i i don't think that's without some
 
02:54:18.950 --> 02:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
potential benefit but i don't think as
 
02:54:21.510 --> 02:54:21.520 align:start position:0%
widely open as discussed that that's all
 
02:54:23.269 --> 02:54:23.279 align:start position:0%
so i agree with you that's that's how we
 
02:54:25.510 --> 02:54:25.520 align:start position:0%
do things and in fact the the economic
 
02:54:27.830 --> 02:54:27.840 align:start position:0%
aspect of it is actually in my mind a
 
02:54:30.550 --> 02:54:30.560 align:start position:0%
very minimal aspect of this um
 
02:54:33.510 --> 02:54:33.520 align:start position:0%
as you described um you know we we don't
 
02:54:35.510 --> 02:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
we don't charge you know there are many
 
02:54:37.830 --> 02:54:37.840 align:start position:0%
patients of mine who who get an a1c and
 
02:54:39.670 --> 02:54:39.680 align:start position:0%
call three months later and we review it
 
02:54:42.630 --> 02:54:42.640 align:start position:0%
together and uh it's a standing order
 
02:54:44.550 --> 02:54:44.560 align:start position:0%
and you know and you just and you manage
 
02:54:45.510 --> 02:54:45.520 align:start position:0%
them over the phone because you know
 
02:54:47.269 --> 02:54:47.279 align:start position:0%
they don't have insurance and you know
 
02:54:49.510 --> 02:54:49.520 align:start position:0%
it's but but that doesn't change my
 
02:54:51.750 --> 02:54:51.760 align:start position:0%
responsibility whether i'm charging them
 
02:54:53.510 --> 02:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
or not i still have the same level of
 
02:54:55.269 --> 02:54:55.279 align:start position:0%
responsibility to provide care that
 
02:54:56.950 --> 02:54:56.960 align:start position:0%
meets the standard of care and that's
 
02:54:58.070 --> 02:54:58.080 align:start position:0%
excellent and
 
02:54:59.830 --> 02:54:59.840 align:start position:0%
and i think that's where this this bill
 
02:55:02.389 --> 02:55:02.399 align:start position:0%
particularly i'll finish it suggest that
 
02:55:05.190 --> 02:55:05.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:05.200 --> 02:55:09.349 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:55:09.349 --> 02:55:09.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:11.110 --> 02:55:11.120 align:start position:0%
a doctor so
 
02:55:13.429 --> 02:55:13.439 align:start position:0%
my note here says you have patience at
 
02:55:16.870 --> 02:55:16.880 align:start position:0%
11 30 and i i am i
 
02:55:18.150 --> 02:55:18.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:55:18.160 --> 02:55:20.389 align:start position:0%
thank you
welcome

02:55:20.389 --> 02:55:20.399 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
02:55:22.469 --> 02:55:22.479 align:start position:0%
um i'm going to call a couple more
 
02:55:24.710 --> 02:55:24.720 align:start position:0%
people to testify
 
02:55:24.720 --> 02:55:25.590 align:start position:0%
people to testify
um

02:55:25.590 --> 02:55:25.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:55:27.590 --> 02:55:27.600 align:start position:0%
apparently there's been a windstorm in
 
02:55:29.110 --> 02:55:29.120 align:start position:0%
auburn and
 
02:55:32.630 --> 02:55:32.640 align:start position:0%
representative edwards is uh
 
02:55:34.870 --> 02:55:34.880 align:start position:0%
not on the internet is he here by
 
02:55:34.880 --> 02:55:38.469 align:start position:0%
not on the internet is he here by
telephone

02:55:38.469 --> 02:55:38.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:41.910 --> 02:55:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:45.030 --> 02:55:45.040 align:start position:0%

uh to
 
02:55:55.429 --> 02:55:55.439 align:start position:0%
questions for you from the committee
 
02:55:55.439 --> 02:55:56.309 align:start position:0%
questions for you from the committee
okay

02:55:56.309 --> 02:55:56.319 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:55:58.469 --> 02:55:58.479 align:start position:0%
sorry i missed so much of uh
 
02:56:01.190 --> 02:56:01.200 align:start position:0%
the previous witnesses answers they were
 
02:56:04.309 --> 02:56:04.319 align:start position:0%
pretty interesting to me
 
02:56:07.670 --> 02:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
anyone with any questions um i see a
 
02:56:07.680 --> 02:56:08.710 align:start position:0%
anyone with any questions um i see a
hand

02:56:08.710 --> 02:56:08.720 align:start position:0%
hand
 
02:56:10.790 --> 02:56:10.800 align:start position:0%
that looks like representative bill
 
02:56:10.800 --> 02:56:19.670 align:start position:0%
that looks like representative bill
nelson

02:56:19.670 --> 02:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:34.950 --> 02:56:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:37.429 --> 02:56:37.439 align:start position:0%
thank you very much um
 
02:56:39.349 --> 02:56:39.359 align:start position:0%
it may have been during your absence of
 
02:56:40.950 --> 02:56:40.960 align:start position:0%
representative edwards we did talk a lot
 
02:56:43.190 --> 02:56:43.200 align:start position:0%
about the diagnostic cascade where one
 
02:56:45.590 --> 02:56:45.600 align:start position:0%
test leads to another and often if there
 
02:56:47.990 --> 02:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
is something that's inconclusive a lab
 
02:56:49.830 --> 02:56:49.840 align:start position:0%
may say we would suggest that you would
 
02:56:52.469 --> 02:56:52.479 align:start position:0%
proceed on with this this and this
 
02:56:54.389 --> 02:56:54.399 align:start position:0%
be given the the fact that there would
 
02:56:57.510 --> 02:56:57.520 align:start position:0%
be a motivation of the lab to encourage
 
02:56:59.910 --> 02:56:59.920 align:start position:0%
more business would you be if we did
 
02:57:01.670 --> 02:57:01.680 align:start position:0%
pass this bill would you be amenable to
 
02:57:03.670 --> 02:57:03.680 align:start position:0%
an amendment that would prohibit a
 
02:57:06.870 --> 02:57:06.880 align:start position:0%
laboratory from suggesting any further
 
02:57:11.429 --> 02:57:11.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:14.070 --> 02:57:14.080 align:start position:0%
so thank you for your question um
 
02:57:15.990 --> 02:57:16.000 align:start position:0%
i think i think that's a very
 
02:57:17.910 --> 02:57:17.920 align:start position:0%
interesting possibility
 
02:57:20.070 --> 02:57:20.080 align:start position:0%
uh i would i would want to talk to
 
02:57:22.550 --> 02:57:22.560 align:start position:0%
people that i know um
 
02:57:24.469 --> 02:57:24.479 align:start position:0%
in arizona about
 
02:57:26.790 --> 02:57:26.800 align:start position:0%
an an effective amendment might like
 
02:57:28.790 --> 02:57:28.800 align:start position:0%
have like that and they've tried
 
02:57:30.150 --> 02:57:30.160 align:start position:0%
something like that
 
02:57:31.990 --> 02:57:32.000 align:start position:0%
i think somebody's pounding some pots
 
02:57:34.389 --> 02:57:34.399 align:start position:0%
and pans in the kitchen somewhere
 
02:57:36.389 --> 02:57:36.399 align:start position:0%
but uh would you say in any case stop
 
02:57:39.590 --> 02:57:39.600 align:start position:0%
pounding pots and pans go ahead
 
02:57:41.110 --> 02:57:41.120 align:start position:0%
so um
 
02:57:43.830 --> 02:57:43.840 align:start position:0%
but to answer your question directly i'm
 
02:57:47.349 --> 02:57:47.359 align:start position:0%
i'm amenable to any amendment that
 
02:57:50.469 --> 02:57:50.479 align:start position:0%
that the this committee wants to offer i
 
02:57:51.280 --> 02:57:51.290 align:start position:0%
would like to
 
02:57:51.290 --> 02:57:54.550 align:start position:0%
would like to
[Music]

02:57:54.550 --> 02:57:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:57.269 --> 02:57:57.279 align:start position:0%
enjoy the fact that some of you may
 
02:57:59.030 --> 02:57:59.040 align:start position:0%
share with me the principle of
 
02:58:01.670 --> 02:58:01.680 align:start position:0%
empowering patients
 
02:58:05.190 --> 02:58:05.200 align:start position:0%
and and allowing them to gain access to
 
02:58:07.349 --> 02:58:07.359 align:start position:0%
their own medical information so that
 
02:58:07.359 --> 02:58:08.150 align:start position:0%
their own medical information so that
they

02:58:08.150 --> 02:58:08.160 align:start position:0%
they
 
02:58:10.710 --> 02:58:10.720 align:start position:0%
can uh do with it what they think they
 
02:58:12.550 --> 02:58:12.560 align:start position:0%
should do whether that's go find a
 
02:58:15.830 --> 02:58:15.840 align:start position:0%
physician or or just eat more healthy or
 
02:58:17.110 --> 02:58:17.120 align:start position:0%
whatever i
 
02:58:19.590 --> 02:58:19.600 align:start position:0%
i do like the medical freedom aspect of
 
02:58:22.389 --> 02:58:22.399 align:start position:0%
this bill and as much as and i'll stop
 
02:58:24.070 --> 02:58:24.080 align:start position:0%
there because that's all you ask
 
02:58:26.469 --> 02:58:26.479 align:start position:0%
representative edwards um
 
02:58:29.110 --> 02:58:29.120 align:start position:0%
given you mentioned the word amendment
 
02:58:32.630 --> 02:58:32.640 align:start position:0%
my plan is to exec this bill next monday
 
02:58:34.870 --> 02:58:34.880 align:start position:0%
so anybody who wishes to bring forth
 
02:58:37.269 --> 02:58:37.279 align:start position:0%
amendments would be very helpful if we
 
02:58:40.070 --> 02:58:40.080 align:start position:0%
could see them by the end of the week so
 
02:58:42.070 --> 02:58:42.080 align:start position:0%
that we wouldn't go right into monday
 
02:58:43.750 --> 02:58:43.760 align:start position:0%
and have to stop and read them at that
 
02:58:45.030 --> 02:58:45.040 align:start position:0%
time so
 
02:58:48.070 --> 02:58:48.080 align:start position:0%
that's the plan i have going forward
 
02:58:51.990 --> 02:58:52.000 align:start position:0%
um let's see uh represented
 
02:58:55.590 --> 02:58:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:57.590 --> 02:58:57.600 align:start position:0%
you had your hand up yes
 
02:59:00.309 --> 02:59:00.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and
 
02:59:03.510 --> 02:59:03.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative edwards
 
02:59:05.429 --> 02:59:05.439 align:start position:0%
uh about two years ago i
 
02:59:07.110 --> 02:59:07.120 align:start position:0%
i wanted to get my cholesterol checked
 
02:59:08.710 --> 02:59:08.720 align:start position:0%
it's been many years before i got
 
02:59:08.720 --> 02:59:09.510 align:start position:0%
it's been many years before i got
checked

02:59:09.510 --> 02:59:09.520 align:start position:0%
checked
 
02:59:12.469 --> 02:59:12.479 align:start position:0%
uh since i got a check so i
 
02:59:14.710 --> 02:59:14.720 align:start position:0%
uh called my tcp
 
02:59:16.790 --> 02:59:16.800 align:start position:0%
uh he had left the practice so i could
 
02:59:19.349 --> 02:59:19.359 align:start position:0%
set up another exam another
 
02:59:19.359 --> 02:59:21.030 align:start position:0%
set up another exam another
appointment

02:59:21.030 --> 02:59:21.040 align:start position:0%
appointment
 
02:59:23.510 --> 02:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
and it was six months before he was
 
02:59:23.520 --> 02:59:24.710 align:start position:0%
and it was six months before he was
available

02:59:24.710 --> 02:59:24.720 align:start position:0%
available
 
02:59:27.030 --> 02:59:27.040 align:start position:0%
i went to that appointment and he gave
 
02:59:30.950 --> 02:59:30.960 align:start position:0%
me an order to go get uh some testing
 
02:59:33.590 --> 02:59:33.600 align:start position:0%
and i started a new job got
 
02:59:35.670 --> 02:59:35.680 align:start position:0%
distracted and by the time i got to the
 
02:59:38.309 --> 02:59:38.319 align:start position:0%
uh to go get the testing the order had
 
02:59:40.550 --> 02:59:40.560 align:start position:0%
expired and i had to go at that point i
 
02:59:41.750 --> 02:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
threw my hands up and i still haven't
 
02:59:44.550 --> 02:59:44.560 align:start position:0%
gotten my cross broadcast so would your
 
02:59:46.070 --> 02:59:46.080 align:start position:0%
would this feel healthy in that
 
02:59:46.080 --> 02:59:48.230 align:start position:0%
would this feel healthy in that
situation

02:59:48.230 --> 02:59:48.240 align:start position:0%
situation
 
02:59:50.070 --> 02:59:50.080 align:start position:0%
i i thank you for the question
 
02:59:52.070 --> 02:59:52.080 align:start position:0%
representative acton and i'd say this
 
02:59:55.349 --> 02:59:55.359 align:start position:0%
bill would uh have addressed directly
 
02:59:56.389 --> 02:59:56.399 align:start position:0%
your issue
 
02:59:58.469 --> 02:59:58.479 align:start position:0%
you you were it sounds like you were in
 
03:00:00.070 --> 03:00:00.080 align:start position:0%
between providers
 
03:00:01.910 --> 03:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
you you knew that you had a chronic
 
03:00:03.590 --> 03:00:03.600 align:start position:0%
condition you knew
 
03:00:06.230 --> 03:00:06.240 align:start position:0%
that you needed a particular cholesterol
 
03:00:06.240 --> 03:00:07.190 align:start position:0%
that you needed a particular cholesterol
test

03:00:07.190 --> 03:00:07.200 align:start position:0%
test
 
03:00:11.590 --> 03:00:11.600 align:start position:0%
uh you knew that based on the results uh
 
03:00:13.910 --> 03:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
what you might do to modify your
 
03:00:16.710 --> 03:00:16.720 align:start position:0%
behavior to to better manage your health
 
03:00:16.720 --> 03:00:17.990 align:start position:0%
behavior to to better manage your health
status

03:00:17.990 --> 03:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
status
 
03:00:18.000 --> 03:00:18.870 align:start position:0%
status
uh

03:00:18.870 --> 03:00:18.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:00:20.950 --> 03:00:20.960 align:start position:0%
this bill would have allowed you
 
03:00:23.750 --> 03:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
to be an empowered respected member of
 
03:00:23.760 --> 03:00:25.030 align:start position:0%
to be an empowered respected member of
society

03:00:25.030 --> 03:00:25.040 align:start position:0%
society
 
03:00:28.389 --> 03:00:28.399 align:start position:0%
able to access your own information and
 
03:00:31.429 --> 03:00:31.439 align:start position:0%
and to behave responsibly in your own
 
03:00:34.630 --> 03:00:34.640 align:start position:0%
self-interest so i think this bill would
 
03:00:38.070 --> 03:00:38.080 align:start position:0%
have helped you yes sir thank you
 
03:00:41.110 --> 03:00:41.120 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro
 
03:00:42.870 --> 03:00:42.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
03:00:44.710 --> 03:00:44.720 align:start position:0%
representative edwards
 
03:00:44.720 --> 03:00:46.389 align:start position:0%
representative edwards
um

03:00:46.389 --> 03:00:46.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:00:48.469 --> 03:00:48.479 align:start position:0%
i realized that you didn't hear all of
 
03:00:51.590 --> 03:00:51.600 align:start position:0%
the previous testimony but some of it um
 
03:00:56.230 --> 03:00:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:00.309 --> 03:01:00.319 align:start position:0%
leading to over testing which might be
 
03:01:02.870 --> 03:01:02.880 align:start position:0%
might be medically problematic and also
 
03:01:05.030 --> 03:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
financially problematic
 
03:01:09.670 --> 03:01:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:11.990 --> 03:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
the difficulty in interpreting many
 
03:01:12.000 --> 03:01:13.510 align:start position:0%
the difficulty in interpreting many
tests

03:01:13.510 --> 03:01:13.520 align:start position:0%
tests
 
03:01:13.520 --> 03:01:14.469 align:start position:0%
tests
um

03:01:14.469 --> 03:01:14.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:01:16.630 --> 03:01:16.640 align:start position:0%
i am very sympathetic to patient
 
03:01:18.630 --> 03:01:18.640 align:start position:0%
autonomy and people being able to take
 
03:01:21.110 --> 03:01:21.120 align:start position:0%
control of their own bodies and their
 
03:01:22.950 --> 03:01:22.960 align:start position:0%
own health
 
03:01:24.790 --> 03:01:24.800 align:start position:0%
but i'm concerned about the
 
03:01:26.950 --> 03:01:26.960 align:start position:0%
complications some of the unintended
 
03:01:28.710 --> 03:01:28.720 align:start position:0%
complications that
 
03:01:28.720 --> 03:01:29.510 align:start position:0%
complications that
um

03:01:29.510 --> 03:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:01:31.670 --> 03:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
you know broad opening of testing might
 
03:01:35.349 --> 03:01:35.359 align:start position:0%
cause so would you be amenable
 
03:01:39.190 --> 03:01:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:42.710 --> 03:01:42.720 align:start position:0%
amending this bill so that it
 
03:01:45.590 --> 03:01:45.600 align:start position:0%
um allowed for certain types of testing
 
03:01:48.630 --> 03:01:48.640 align:start position:0%
that were determined to be
 
03:01:51.510 --> 03:01:51.520 align:start position:0%
more useful and
 
03:01:54.309 --> 03:01:54.319 align:start position:0%
tested did not lead to unintended bad
 
03:01:54.319 --> 03:01:55.750 align:start position:0%
tested did not lead to unintended bad
consequences

03:01:55.750 --> 03:01:55.760 align:start position:0%
consequences
 
03:01:55.760 --> 03:01:57.269 align:start position:0%
consequences
um

03:01:57.269 --> 03:01:57.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:01:59.190 --> 03:01:59.200 align:start position:0%
that might take retaining the bill
 
03:02:00.469 --> 03:02:00.479 align:start position:0%
because i think this would be a
 
03:02:02.550 --> 03:02:02.560 align:start position:0%
complicated um
 
03:02:04.630 --> 03:02:04.640 align:start position:0%
amendment to make we need a lot of
 
03:02:07.349 --> 03:02:07.359 align:start position:0%
expertise to know which tests should be
 
03:02:09.830 --> 03:02:09.840 align:start position:0%
included and which should be um not
 
03:02:11.910 --> 03:02:11.920 align:start position:0%
included but would you be open to that
 
03:02:11.920 --> 03:02:14.150 align:start position:0%
included but would you be open to that
approach

03:02:14.150 --> 03:02:14.160 align:start position:0%
approach
 
03:02:18.309 --> 03:02:18.319 align:start position:0%
so the short answers um uh yes but um i
 
03:02:20.790 --> 03:02:20.800 align:start position:0%
i would just as a fellow legislator
 
03:02:22.230 --> 03:02:22.240 align:start position:0%
suggest to you
 
03:02:23.670 --> 03:02:23.680 align:start position:0%
that um
 
03:02:23.680 --> 03:02:24.469 align:start position:0%
that um
that

03:02:24.469 --> 03:02:24.479 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:02:27.429 --> 03:02:27.439 align:start position:0%
that that's probably uh too much detail
 
03:02:29.830 --> 03:02:29.840 align:start position:0%
for a policy committee to try to
 
03:02:31.910 --> 03:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
research and legislate and put into
 
03:02:31.920 --> 03:02:33.830 align:start position:0%
research and legislate and put into
statute

03:02:33.830 --> 03:02:33.840 align:start position:0%
statute
 
03:02:37.670 --> 03:02:37.680 align:start position:0%
that it might be better to identify
 
03:02:40.469 --> 03:02:40.479 align:start position:0%
some some panel that already exists
 
03:02:43.030 --> 03:02:43.040 align:start position:0%
somewhere and have them
 
03:02:43.040 --> 03:02:44.389 align:start position:0%
somewhere and have them
issued

03:02:44.389 --> 03:02:44.399 align:start position:0%
issued
 
03:02:47.830 --> 03:02:47.840 align:start position:0%
able to issue guidance on on which labs
 
03:02:49.670 --> 03:02:49.680 align:start position:0%
should be able to be ordered and which
 
03:02:49.680 --> 03:02:50.630 align:start position:0%
should be able to be ordered and which
shouldn't

03:02:50.630 --> 03:02:50.640 align:start position:0%
shouldn't
 
03:02:52.950 --> 03:02:52.960 align:start position:0%
keep in mind my bill does not mandate
 
03:02:55.990 --> 03:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
that the laboratories do the testing so
 
03:02:56.000 --> 03:02:56.830 align:start position:0%
that the laboratories do the testing so
i

03:02:56.830 --> 03:02:56.840 align:start position:0%
i
 
03:02:59.990 --> 03:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
i do think i've left some flexibility in
 
03:03:01.830 --> 03:03:01.840 align:start position:0%
there for
 
03:03:05.910 --> 03:03:05.920 align:start position:0%
labs and pathologists just simply say no
 
03:03:08.469 --> 03:03:08.479 align:start position:0%
uh it's a it's a voluntary
 
03:03:11.750 --> 03:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
uh interaction between labs and in
 
03:03:11.760 --> 03:03:12.630 align:start position:0%
uh interaction between labs and in
people

03:03:12.630 --> 03:03:12.640 align:start position:0%
people
 
03:03:14.790 --> 03:03:14.800 align:start position:0%
so um so i
 
03:03:16.870 --> 03:03:16.880 align:start position:0%
i i just would suggest a different
 
03:03:19.429 --> 03:03:19.439 align:start position:0%
approach but i'm open to
 
03:03:20.790 --> 03:03:20.800 align:start position:0%
an amendment if that's what the
 
03:03:24.870 --> 03:03:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:26.950 --> 03:03:26.960 align:start position:0%
any further questions for representative
 
03:03:29.830 --> 03:03:29.840 align:start position:0%
edwards representative gay
 
03:03:32.950 --> 03:03:32.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you um
 
03:03:34.469 --> 03:03:34.479 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
03:03:35.990 --> 03:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
do you agree
 
03:03:37.590 --> 03:03:37.600 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to
 
03:03:40.870 --> 03:03:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:43.110 --> 03:03:43.120 align:start position:0%
do you agree that this bill is a
 
03:03:45.670 --> 03:03:45.680 align:start position:0%
compromise for people who don't have
 
03:03:45.680 --> 03:03:46.870 align:start position:0%
compromise for people who don't have
insurance

03:03:46.870 --> 03:03:46.880 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
03:03:48.550 --> 03:03:48.560 align:start position:0%
and need to do this
 
03:03:51.110 --> 03:03:51.120 align:start position:0%
without paying for a physician
 
03:03:52.830 --> 03:03:52.840 align:start position:0%
either because you can't
 
03:03:55.190 --> 03:03:55.200 align:start position:0%
reach position or they just can't afford
 
03:03:55.200 --> 03:03:56.070 align:start position:0%
reach position or they just can't afford
it

03:03:56.070 --> 03:03:56.080 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:03:58.550 --> 03:03:58.560 align:start position:0%
and people who do have insurance you've
 
03:03:58.560 --> 03:04:00.630 align:start position:0%
and people who do have insurance you've
identified

03:04:00.630 --> 03:04:00.640 align:start position:0%
identified
 
03:04:00.640 --> 03:04:01.510 align:start position:0%
identified
you

03:04:01.510 --> 03:04:01.520 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:04:03.910 --> 03:04:03.920 align:start position:0%
you've identified the exact sweet spot
 
03:04:05.190 --> 03:04:05.200 align:start position:0%
for this bill
 
03:04:08.550 --> 03:04:08.560 align:start position:0%
that that individual that sentient adult
 
03:04:11.750 --> 03:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
who is in between health care providers
 
03:04:14.870 --> 03:04:14.880 align:start position:0%
and maybe be short on funds but knows
 
03:04:16.950 --> 03:04:16.960 align:start position:0%
that they need to know something about
 
03:04:20.070 --> 03:04:20.080 align:start position:0%
their health status that a diagnostic
 
03:04:23.269 --> 03:04:23.279 align:start position:0%
pathology exam might reveal
 
03:04:24.870 --> 03:04:24.880 align:start position:0%
and so
 
03:04:27.110 --> 03:04:27.120 align:start position:0%
that would be
 
03:04:29.750 --> 03:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
a key segment of our
 
03:04:31.910 --> 03:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
adult population that would benefit from
 
03:04:34.150 --> 03:04:34.160 align:start position:0%
this bill those without
 
03:04:34.160 --> 03:04:37.750 align:start position:0%
this bill those without
providers

03:04:37.750 --> 03:04:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:37.760 --> 03:04:39.750 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

03:04:39.750 --> 03:04:39.760 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
03:04:42.710 --> 03:04:42.720 align:start position:0%
the other condition i mean that is
 
03:04:44.070 --> 03:04:44.080 align:start position:0%
you know i agree
 
03:04:44.080 --> 03:04:45.429 align:start position:0%
you know i agree
absolutely

03:04:45.429 --> 03:04:45.439 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
03:04:46.870 --> 03:04:46.880 align:start position:0%
and the
 
03:04:49.429 --> 03:04:49.439 align:start position:0%
i found myself in a position it wasn't a
 
03:04:50.790 --> 03:04:50.800 align:start position:0%
lab test
 
03:04:52.870 --> 03:04:52.880 align:start position:0%
it was um
 
03:04:55.030 --> 03:04:55.040 align:start position:0%
i had to see three
 
03:04:55.040 --> 03:04:55.990 align:start position:0%
i had to see three
uh

03:04:55.990 --> 03:04:56.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:04:58.870 --> 03:04:58.880 align:start position:0%
three spinal surgeons before i found one
 
03:05:01.510 --> 03:05:01.520 align:start position:0%
who agreed with the doctor who read my
 
03:05:01.520 --> 03:05:02.550 align:start position:0%
who agreed with the doctor who read my
mri

03:05:02.550 --> 03:05:02.560 align:start position:0%
mri
 
03:05:04.870 --> 03:05:04.880 align:start position:0%
and so i'm very sympathetic to this
 
03:05:06.790 --> 03:05:06.800 align:start position:0%
situation because
 
03:05:08.870 --> 03:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
it sounds like this would also
 
03:05:11.510 --> 03:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
uh put this as a question wouldn't this
 
03:05:15.750 --> 03:05:15.760 align:start position:0%
also help a person who has insurance
 
03:05:18.870 --> 03:05:18.880 align:start position:0%
and can't find a doctor who is agreeing
 
03:05:20.950 --> 03:05:20.960 align:start position:0%
with their symptoms so that this way
 
03:05:24.630 --> 03:05:24.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:25.990 --> 03:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
what's their
 
03:05:26.000 --> 03:05:27.030 align:start position:0%
what's their
what

03:05:27.030 --> 03:05:27.040 align:start position:0%
what
 
03:05:29.030 --> 03:05:29.040 align:start position:0%
their problem is that nobody's listening
 
03:05:31.429 --> 03:05:31.439 align:start position:0%
to yet
 
03:05:33.510 --> 03:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
so i'm thinking it benefits more i don't
 
03:05:35.110 --> 03:05:35.120 align:start position:0%
know how to put that question but don't
 
03:05:37.349 --> 03:05:37.359 align:start position:0%
you think that helps benefits people who
 
03:05:40.150 --> 03:05:40.160 align:start position:0%
have insurance too as well as the people
 
03:05:42.870 --> 03:05:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:45.110 --> 03:05:45.120 align:start position:0%
i i think any uh thank you for the
 
03:05:47.510 --> 03:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
question i i think that anytime
 
03:05:50.950 --> 03:05:50.960 align:start position:0%
you empower a patient to take care of
 
03:05:53.030 --> 03:05:53.040 align:start position:0%
themselves and to worry about their own
 
03:05:54.469 --> 03:05:54.479 align:start position:0%
health status
 
03:05:56.150 --> 03:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
you're making the health care system
 
03:05:58.230 --> 03:05:58.240 align:start position:0%
that much better i
 
03:06:01.110 --> 03:06:01.120 align:start position:0%
i i heard the theory
 
03:06:04.710 --> 03:06:04.720 align:start position:0%
of of cascade diagnostic procedures and
 
03:06:06.550 --> 03:06:06.560 align:start position:0%
potential increases to the health
 
03:06:08.150 --> 03:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
insurance system
 
03:06:09.910 --> 03:06:09.920 align:start position:0%
but i would just uh
 
03:06:12.950 --> 03:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
remind folks that this this is not a new
 
03:06:15.510 --> 03:06:15.520 align:start position:0%
law it's been done in arizona we could
 
03:06:18.309 --> 03:06:18.319 align:start position:0%
find out if this cascade problem has
 
03:06:21.190 --> 03:06:21.200 align:start position:0%
been a problem but my bill explicitly
 
03:06:21.200 --> 03:06:22.230 align:start position:0%
been a problem but my bill explicitly
states

03:06:22.230 --> 03:06:22.240 align:start position:0%
states
 
03:06:24.309 --> 03:06:24.319 align:start position:0%
that insurance companies do not have to
 
03:06:27.190 --> 03:06:27.200 align:start position:0%
pay for the procedure
 
03:06:28.950 --> 03:06:28.960 align:start position:0%
that's an individual
 
03:06:32.230 --> 03:06:32.240 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the the person who who
 
03:06:33.830 --> 03:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
wants to know more about their health
 
03:06:33.840 --> 03:06:35.030 align:start position:0%
wants to know more about their health
condition

03:06:35.030 --> 03:06:35.040 align:start position:0%
condition
 
03:06:38.710 --> 03:06:38.720 align:start position:0%
so so the rest i think is theory and um
 
03:06:40.550 --> 03:06:40.560 align:start position:0%
and a valid concern
 
03:06:42.870 --> 03:06:42.880 align:start position:0%
but i wouldn't kill this bill out of
 
03:06:44.870 --> 03:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
theory and concerns that haven't been
 
03:06:44.880 --> 03:06:47.910 align:start position:0%
theory and concerns that haven't been
validated

03:06:47.910 --> 03:06:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:49.910 --> 03:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
representative cushman
 
03:06:51.910 --> 03:06:51.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
 
03:06:54.550 --> 03:06:54.560 align:start position:0%
representative edwards um
 
03:06:56.550 --> 03:06:56.560 align:start position:0%
i was wondering are you aware that there
 
03:06:58.870 --> 03:06:58.880 align:start position:0%
are some conditions that um
 
03:06:58.880 --> 03:07:00.389 align:start position:0%
are some conditions that um
that

03:07:00.389 --> 03:07:00.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:07:03.030 --> 03:07:03.040 align:start position:0%
patients feel symptoms for a long time
 
03:07:06.710 --> 03:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
before they they become clinical
 
03:07:06.720 --> 03:07:07.429 align:start position:0%
before they they become clinical
so

03:07:07.429 --> 03:07:07.439 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:07:10.469 --> 03:07:10.479 align:start position:0%
to the question about amending the bill
 
03:07:12.469 --> 03:07:12.479 align:start position:0%
this could potentially
 
03:07:15.030 --> 03:07:15.040 align:start position:0%
uh be a disservice to people
 
03:07:17.030 --> 03:07:17.040 align:start position:0%
experiencing some of those conditions if
 
03:07:18.870 --> 03:07:18.880 align:start position:0%
they're they're checking their labs and
 
03:07:21.030 --> 03:07:21.040 align:start position:0%
they they have you know they're really
 
03:07:22.469 --> 03:07:22.479 align:start position:0%
trying to get to the bottom of their
 
03:07:25.830 --> 03:07:25.840 align:start position:0%
symptoms to stop them from
 
03:07:28.469 --> 03:07:28.479 align:start position:0%
repeat labs
 
03:07:31.830 --> 03:07:31.840 align:start position:0%
that are negative at first
 
03:07:33.990 --> 03:07:34.000 align:start position:0%
so i don't thank you for the question i
 
03:07:36.309 --> 03:07:36.319 align:start position:0%
i don't want to overstate my credentials
 
03:07:39.590 --> 03:07:39.600 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm i'm merely a health care manager
 
03:07:42.469 --> 03:07:42.479 align:start position:0%
with over 40 years in the industry doing
 
03:07:43.510 --> 03:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
a range
 
03:07:45.750 --> 03:07:45.760 align:start position:0%
range of different things i'm not
 
03:07:47.349 --> 03:07:47.359 align:start position:0%
the closest i've come to being a
 
03:07:49.670 --> 03:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
pathologist was carrying urine specimens
 
03:07:52.309 --> 03:07:52.319 align:start position:0%
from the er to the lab so i don't think
 
03:07:55.269 --> 03:07:55.279 align:start position:0%
that qualified me uh i did learn how to
 
03:07:57.110 --> 03:07:57.120 align:start position:0%
wash my hands though
 
03:07:59.190 --> 03:07:59.200 align:start position:0%
um but but
 
03:08:00.469 --> 03:08:00.479 align:start position:0%
so i
 
03:08:03.190 --> 03:08:03.200 align:start position:0%
i defer to this committee because this
 
03:08:06.070 --> 03:08:06.080 align:start position:0%
committee could be its own medical board
 
03:08:09.030 --> 03:08:09.040 align:start position:0%
with all the diversity on it
 
03:08:11.990 --> 03:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
to to make those determinations i'm i'm
 
03:08:13.990 --> 03:08:14.000 align:start position:0%
bringing it to the committee saying
 
03:08:16.070 --> 03:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
here's a small way
 
03:08:18.950 --> 03:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
that we could allow our brick and mortar
 
03:08:22.070 --> 03:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
industry to keep up with what's going on
 
03:08:23.269 --> 03:08:23.279 align:start position:0%
in the medical
 
03:08:27.190 --> 03:08:27.200 align:start position:0%
wearable diagnostic industry um and
 
03:08:29.349 --> 03:08:29.359 align:start position:0%
uh and it's a medical freedom bill from
 
03:08:31.910 --> 03:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
my perspective so so i'm coming at it
 
03:08:34.550 --> 03:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
from sort of um you know who who
 
03:08:36.389 --> 03:08:36.399 align:start position:0%
controls your body
 
03:08:39.510 --> 03:08:39.520 align:start position:0%
as much as i i respect of the physician
 
03:08:41.110 --> 03:08:41.120 align:start position:0%
community for
 
03:08:44.309 --> 03:08:44.319 align:start position:0%
taking ownership and accountability uh
 
03:08:47.110 --> 03:08:47.120 align:start position:0%
and and citing potential uh health
 
03:08:47.120 --> 03:08:48.389 align:start position:0%
and and citing potential uh health
economics

03:08:48.389 --> 03:08:48.399 align:start position:0%
economics
 
03:08:50.550 --> 03:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
uh issues with this bill
 
03:08:50.560 --> 03:08:51.590 align:start position:0%
uh issues with this bill
i

03:08:51.590 --> 03:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
i
 
03:08:53.429 --> 03:08:53.439 align:start position:0%
i think
 
03:08:56.550 --> 03:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
i start from the perspective of saying
 
03:08:58.550 --> 03:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
in our society
 
03:09:02.389 --> 03:09:02.399 align:start position:0%
the individual has a tremendous respect
 
03:09:04.870 --> 03:09:04.880 align:start position:0%
from its government from its from from
 
03:09:07.269 --> 03:09:07.279 align:start position:0%
and hopefully from its
 
03:09:10.630 --> 03:09:10.640 align:start position:0%
institutions to to be allowed
 
03:09:10.640 --> 03:09:11.910 align:start position:0%
institutions to to be allowed
to

03:09:11.910 --> 03:09:11.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:09:14.710 --> 03:09:14.720 align:start position:0%
live in a way in which they exercise
 
03:09:17.269 --> 03:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
choice and so this is a this is i don't
 
03:09:19.190 --> 03:09:19.200 align:start position:0%
know it's kind of a pro-choice my body
 
03:09:20.870 --> 03:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
my choice kind of bill
 
03:09:23.030 --> 03:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
i know that offends some people to to
 
03:09:26.550 --> 03:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
borrow that phrase but but but it is so
 
03:09:29.429 --> 03:09:29.439 align:start position:0%
um i i didn't answer your question other
 
03:09:31.190 --> 03:09:31.200 align:start position:0%
than to speak a lot and say i don't know
 
03:09:35.269 --> 03:09:35.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:39.750 --> 03:09:39.760 align:start position:0%
i see representative merchants hand up
 
03:09:41.030 --> 03:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
 
03:09:43.429 --> 03:09:43.439 align:start position:0%
represent edwards for taking my question
 
03:09:45.910 --> 03:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
um we've heard throughout this um
 
03:09:49.269 --> 03:09:49.279 align:start position:0%
testimony about the issue about cost
 
03:09:51.349 --> 03:09:51.359 align:start position:0%
and also over testing and so forth my
 
03:09:53.030 --> 03:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
understanding in the bill
 
03:09:56.150 --> 03:09:56.160 align:start position:0%
under lines 22 23 and 24
 
03:09:57.750 --> 03:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
that there's no cost to the insurance
 
03:09:59.190 --> 03:09:59.200 align:start position:0%
company this is out of pocket to the
 
03:09:59.200 --> 03:10:00.150 align:start position:0%
company this is out of pocket to the
patient

03:10:00.150 --> 03:10:00.160 align:start position:0%
patient
 
03:10:02.150 --> 03:10:02.160 align:start position:0%
so in essence because the cost of lab
 
03:10:03.910 --> 03:10:03.920 align:start position:0%
tests being what they are today is that
 
03:10:06.230 --> 03:10:06.240 align:start position:0%
sort of a self-regulating
 
03:10:07.990 --> 03:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
step in a sense that
 
03:10:09.670 --> 03:10:09.680 align:start position:0%
patients aren't going to over do a lot
 
03:10:10.870 --> 03:10:10.880 align:start position:0%
of testing if they have to pay for
 
03:10:12.150 --> 03:10:12.160 align:start position:0%
out-of-pocket they have the privilege to
 
03:10:14.230 --> 03:10:14.240 align:start position:0%
do it but the reality is because of the
 
03:10:16.070 --> 03:10:16.080 align:start position:0%
cost situation most likely they're not
 
03:10:19.910 --> 03:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:22.469 --> 03:10:22.479 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question and yes i'm a
 
03:10:24.630 --> 03:10:24.640 align:start position:0%
proponent of the pricing mechanism and
 
03:10:26.790 --> 03:10:26.800 align:start position:0%
how the pricing mechanism disciplines
 
03:10:30.389 --> 03:10:30.399 align:start position:0%
both supply and demand and makes people
 
03:10:33.750 --> 03:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
come to rational choices so yes
 
03:10:35.030 --> 03:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:10:37.190 --> 03:10:37.200 align:start position:0%
i'm going to be running a test
 
03:10:39.990 --> 03:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
representative soloway's computer audio
 
03:10:43.190 --> 03:10:43.200 align:start position:0%
is not working so he's got video on his
 
03:10:46.150 --> 03:10:46.160 align:start position:0%
screen and is picking up audio on his
 
03:10:50.469 --> 03:10:50.479 align:start position:0%
phone the question is can we hear him so
 
03:10:51.910 --> 03:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
can you hear me
 
03:10:56.950 --> 03:10:56.960 align:start position:0%

pass the test
 
03:11:02.550 --> 03:11:02.560 align:start position:0%

03:12:50.150 --> 03:12:50.160 align:start position:0%
we're a professional membership
 
03:12:52.230 --> 03:12:52.240 align:start position:0%
organization that represents 150
 
03:12:53.910 --> 03:12:53.920 align:start position:0%

hampshire
 
03:12:57.030 --> 03:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
this year marks 25 years that we've been
 
03:12:59.349 --> 03:12:59.359 align:start position:0%
licensed and during that time we've seen
 
03:13:02.070 --> 03:13:02.080 align:start position:0%
significant growth in our profession and
 
03:13:04.389 --> 03:13:04.399 align:start position:0%
public interest in our services
 
03:13:06.710 --> 03:13:06.720 align:start position:0%
so our association has concerns that
 
03:13:09.830 --> 03:13:09.840 align:start position:0%
this bill is its currently proposed um
 
03:13:11.750 --> 03:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
defines a licensed medical practitioner
 
03:13:13.190 --> 03:13:13.200 align:start position:0%
as a physician
 
03:13:15.190 --> 03:13:15.200 align:start position:0%
an advanced practice nurse practitioner
 
03:13:17.990 --> 03:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
or a physician assistant
 
03:13:19.990 --> 03:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
failure to list new hampshire licensed
 
03:13:22.070 --> 03:13:22.080 align:start position:0%
naturopathic doctors as licensed medical
 
03:13:25.110 --> 03:13:25.120 align:start position:0%
practitioners in item one of this bill
 
03:13:28.309 --> 03:13:28.319 align:start position:0%
is actually in direct conflict with the
 
03:13:30.790 --> 03:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
naturopathic healthcare practice law
 
03:13:34.229 --> 03:13:34.239 align:start position:0%
which is rsa 328e
 
03:13:36.790 --> 03:13:36.800 align:start position:0%
which passed in 1995.
 
03:13:38.630 --> 03:13:38.640 align:start position:0%
this law specifically authorizes
 
03:13:40.309 --> 03:13:40.319 align:start position:0%
naturopathic doctors to order and
 
03:13:42.950 --> 03:13:42.960 align:start position:0%
interpret lab tests
 
03:13:44.630 --> 03:13:44.640 align:start position:0%
and this aspect of our scope of practice
 
03:13:46.229 --> 03:13:46.239 align:start position:0%
is consistent with our professional
 
03:13:48.309 --> 03:13:48.319 align:start position:0%
medical training where all licensees
 
03:13:49.830 --> 03:13:49.840 align:start position:0%
have attended a four-year medical
 
03:13:51.590 --> 03:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
education program at an accredited
 
03:13:54.309 --> 03:13:54.319 align:start position:0%
university or accredited institution
 
03:13:56.630 --> 03:13:56.640 align:start position:0%
uh with specific and extensive training
 
03:13:58.790 --> 03:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
in this diagnostic tool
 
03:14:01.190 --> 03:14:01.200 align:start position:0%
um so we're requesting that item one be
 
03:14:02.870 --> 03:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
amended to include
 
03:14:06.030 --> 03:14:06.040 align:start position:0%
a naturopathic doctor licensed under rsa
 
03:14:10.229 --> 03:14:10.239 align:start position:0%
328e as a licensed medical practitioner
 
03:14:12.630 --> 03:14:12.640 align:start position:0%
and just to speak to our kind of stance
 
03:14:13.910 --> 03:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
on this bill
 
03:14:16.150 --> 03:14:16.160 align:start position:0%
we would gladly support it if we are
 
03:14:17.670 --> 03:14:17.680 align:start position:0%
included in it
 
03:14:20.309 --> 03:14:20.319 align:start position:0%
we do have mixed feelings about patients
 
03:14:22.469 --> 03:14:22.479 align:start position:0%
self-ordering tests
 
03:14:24.150 --> 03:14:24.160 align:start position:0%
but this practice has been in place for
 
03:14:25.349 --> 03:14:25.359 align:start position:0%
quite a while
 
03:14:28.070 --> 03:14:28.080 align:start position:0%
mainly by uninsured folks as others have
 
03:14:31.429 --> 03:14:31.439 align:start position:0%
pointed out um we actually like item
 
03:14:32.950 --> 03:14:32.960 align:start position:0%
three of this bill
 
03:14:32.960 --> 03:14:34.550 align:start position:0%
three of this bill
which

03:14:34.550 --> 03:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
which
 
03:14:37.190 --> 03:14:37.200 align:start position:0%
says that if if an unlicensed medical
 
03:14:39.190 --> 03:14:39.200 align:start position:0%
provider comes in contact with with
 
03:14:41.190 --> 03:14:41.200 align:start position:0%
these lab results they would need to
 
03:14:43.830 --> 03:14:43.840 align:start position:0%
refer to a licensed medical provider
 
03:14:46.070 --> 03:14:46.080 align:start position:0%
um i think of the countless people who
 
03:14:47.670 --> 03:14:47.680 align:start position:0%
are ordering their own labs and
 
03:14:49.750 --> 03:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
interpreting them and i think that this
 
03:14:51.429 --> 03:14:51.439 align:start position:0%
would actually
 
03:14:52.389 --> 03:14:52.399 align:start position:0%
lead to
 
03:14:52.399 --> 03:14:53.750 align:start position:0%
lead to
to

03:14:53.750 --> 03:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:14:55.830 --> 03:14:55.840 align:start position:0%
better health outcomes for the people of
 
03:14:57.510 --> 03:14:57.520 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
03:15:00.469 --> 03:15:00.479 align:start position:0%
and some of the the more
 
03:15:02.309 --> 03:15:02.319 align:start position:0%
obscure labs that people are ordering
 
03:15:04.150 --> 03:15:04.160 align:start position:0%
such as diagnosis
 
03:15:04.160 --> 03:15:05.429 align:start position:0%
such as diagnosis
general

03:15:05.429 --> 03:15:05.439 align:start position:0%
general
 
03:15:07.030 --> 03:15:07.040 align:start position:0%
genetic testing
 
03:15:10.150 --> 03:15:10.160 align:start position:0%
and food sensitivity testing or salivary
 
03:15:13.190 --> 03:15:13.200 align:start position:0%
hormone panels um that people are
 
03:15:14.950 --> 03:15:14.960 align:start position:0%
self-ordering we actually have a lot of
 
03:15:17.030 --> 03:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
experience interpreting those
 
03:15:19.269 --> 03:15:19.279 align:start position:0%
um and so we think it would you know
 
03:15:21.349 --> 03:15:21.359 align:start position:0%
provide better quality of care for the
 
03:15:23.110 --> 03:15:23.120 align:start position:0%
citizens of new hampshire
 
03:15:24.630 --> 03:15:24.640 align:start position:0%
so thank you for your time i'm happy to
 
03:15:32.950 --> 03:15:32.960 align:start position:0%

my name is doug phelan i'm a family

bedford new hampshire
 
03:16:18.710 --> 03:16:18.720 align:start position:0%
and i am present today on behalf of the
 
03:16:19.830 --> 03:16:19.840 align:start position:0%
new hampshire academy of family
 
03:16:21.429 --> 03:16:21.439 align:start position:0%
physicians and myself
 
03:16:24.309 --> 03:16:24.319 align:start position:0%
speaking in opposition to hb 381
 
03:16:26.070 --> 03:16:26.080 align:start position:0%
so many of you are already aware that in
 
03:16:27.590 --> 03:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
the united states we spend far and away
 
03:16:29.590 --> 03:16:29.600 align:start position:0%
the most money per capita on health care
 
03:16:30.870 --> 03:16:30.880 align:start position:0%
nearly eleven thousand dollars per
 
03:16:33.269 --> 03:16:33.279 align:start position:0%
citizen and yet amongst comparable
 
03:16:35.670 --> 03:16:35.680 align:start position:0%
nations in the oecd we have the lowest
 
03:16:37.269 --> 03:16:37.279 align:start position:0%
life expectancy the fifth highest
 
03:16:39.190 --> 03:16:39.200 align:start position:0%
maternal mortality the highest chronic
 
03:16:41.670 --> 03:16:41.680 align:start position:0%
disease burden and i could go on
 
03:16:44.950 --> 03:16:44.960 align:start position:0%
we've got work to do and we know it
 
03:16:46.309 --> 03:16:46.319 align:start position:0%
but i think this shows we can spend
 
03:16:48.550 --> 03:16:48.560 align:start position:0%
money all we want but it's not getting
 
03:16:50.389 --> 03:16:50.399 align:start position:0%
us to the goal it's not getting us to
 
03:16:50.399 --> 03:16:51.510 align:start position:0%
us to the goal it's not getting us to
health

03:16:51.510 --> 03:16:51.520 align:start position:0%
health
 
03:16:54.070 --> 03:16:54.080 align:start position:0%
so why bring this bill this up in a bill
 
03:16:57.830 --> 03:16:57.840 align:start position:0%
regarding direct access testing or dat
 
03:16:59.429 --> 03:16:59.439 align:start position:0%
because if we want to improve our health
 
03:17:01.990 --> 03:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
outcomes and spend less while doing so
 
03:17:04.229 --> 03:17:04.239 align:start position:0%
um what we don't necessarily want to do
 
03:17:06.710 --> 03:17:06.720 align:start position:0%
and is have open access for any lab test
 
03:17:07.990 --> 03:17:08.000 align:start position:0%
in a catalog
 
03:17:09.510 --> 03:17:09.520 align:start position:0%
just because somebody has the money to
 
03:17:10.790 --> 03:17:10.800 align:start position:0%
pay for it
 
03:17:14.150 --> 03:17:14.160 align:start position:0%
more testing does not equal more health
 
03:17:14.160 --> 03:17:15.110 align:start position:0%
more testing does not equal more health
and

03:17:15.110 --> 03:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:17:16.469 --> 03:17:16.479 align:start position:0%
i think we would say that if you think
 
03:17:19.110 --> 03:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
that unfettered dat is beneficial if you
 
03:17:20.870 --> 03:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
truly believe in your heart of hearts
 
03:17:22.150 --> 03:17:22.160 align:start position:0%
that it is
 
03:17:22.160 --> 03:17:23.030 align:start position:0%
that it is
then

03:17:23.030 --> 03:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
then
 
03:17:25.110 --> 03:17:25.120 align:start position:0%
you tend not to make as in sections in
 
03:17:26.710 --> 03:17:26.720 align:start position:0%
five and six do
 
03:17:29.030 --> 03:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
uh with regards to insurance so that
 
03:17:30.550 --> 03:17:30.560 align:start position:0%
only those with the money to get the
 
03:17:32.550 --> 03:17:32.560 align:start position:0%
tests have the access
 
03:17:34.070 --> 03:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
so we would posit
 
03:17:36.229 --> 03:17:36.239 align:start position:0%
generally that the bill is not in the
 
03:17:38.550 --> 03:17:38.560 align:start position:0%
sum of its parts going to promote health
 
03:17:40.150 --> 03:17:40.160 align:start position:0%
but if you disagree with that and feel
 
03:17:42.070 --> 03:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
that it does we would also posit that it
 
03:17:44.070 --> 03:17:44.080 align:start position:0%
would then exacerbate health inequities
 
03:17:45.590 --> 03:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
for our patients
 
03:17:48.070 --> 03:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
when it comes to resource utilization
 
03:17:50.710 --> 03:17:50.720 align:start position:0%
how has the covid19 pandemic driven home
 
03:17:53.110 --> 03:17:53.120 align:start position:0%
the importance of resource utilization
 
03:17:54.790 --> 03:17:54.800 align:start position:0%
how long did it take us to switch
 
03:17:56.630 --> 03:17:56.640 align:start position:0%
production mechanisms to make sure that
 
03:17:59.190 --> 03:17:59.200 align:start position:0%
we had enough lab supplies enough vials
 
03:18:02.389 --> 03:18:02.399 align:start position:0%
swabs reagents to run tests i can
 
03:18:04.710 --> 03:18:04.720 align:start position:0%
remember a time in the spring where due
 
03:18:06.550 --> 03:18:06.560 align:start position:0%
to coded testing requirements we were
 
03:18:08.630 --> 03:18:08.640 align:start position:0%
asked not to run certain types of
 
03:18:10.550 --> 03:18:10.560 align:start position:0%
sexually transmitted disease tests
 
03:18:12.309 --> 03:18:12.319 align:start position:0%
because they used the same supplies that
 
03:18:14.630 --> 03:18:14.640 align:start position:0%
were needed for coded testing this is
 
03:18:16.309 --> 03:18:16.319 align:start position:0%
not a hypothetical
 
03:18:18.070 --> 03:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
health care is not immune to the laws of
 
03:18:20.150 --> 03:18:20.160 align:start position:0%
economics and laboratory studies are one
 
03:18:22.550 --> 03:18:22.560 align:start position:0%
example of the struggle between finite
 
03:18:25.429 --> 03:18:25.439 align:start position:0%
resources and infinite wants and needs
 
03:18:27.190 --> 03:18:27.200 align:start position:0%
we set policies to make sure that the
 
03:18:29.670 --> 03:18:29.680 align:start position:0%
resources are allocated appropriately
 
03:18:31.750 --> 03:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
so to do as part two of the bill
 
03:18:33.670 --> 03:18:33.680 align:start position:0%
indicates mandating that a person may
 
03:18:36.389 --> 03:18:36.399 align:start position:0%
directly obtain any study from any
 
03:18:38.630 --> 03:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
licensed laboratory without a medical
 
03:18:40.630 --> 03:18:40.640 align:start position:0%
provider we feel that would open up our
 
03:18:42.070 --> 03:18:42.080 align:start position:0%
state to the depletion of scarce
 
03:18:42.080 --> 03:18:43.510 align:start position:0%
state to the depletion of scarce
resources

03:18:43.510 --> 03:18:43.520 align:start position:0%
resources
 
03:18:45.510 --> 03:18:45.520 align:start position:0%
you know we we do not have to imagine a
 
03:18:47.190 --> 03:18:47.200 align:start position:0%
world where depletion of lab resources
 
03:18:48.950 --> 03:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
both physical and human might lead to
 
03:18:51.269 --> 03:18:51.279 align:start position:0%
lag times and availability issues we've
 
03:18:53.190 --> 03:18:53.200 align:start position:0%
just been living through it
 
03:18:55.110 --> 03:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
when it comes to provider responsibility
 
03:18:57.190 --> 03:18:57.200 align:start position:0%
part 4 seeks to exonerate medical
 
03:18:59.990 --> 03:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
providers from reviewing or acting upon
 
03:19:02.710 --> 03:19:02.720 align:start position:0%
by compulsion the the dat results and
 
03:19:04.630 --> 03:19:04.640 align:start position:0%
removing liability and disciplinary
 
03:19:04.640 --> 03:19:05.590 align:start position:0%
removing liability and disciplinary
action

03:19:05.590 --> 03:19:05.600 align:start position:0%
action
 
03:19:07.110 --> 03:19:07.120 align:start position:0%
we feel this creates a precarious
 
03:19:07.120 --> 03:19:08.550 align:start position:0%
we feel this creates a precarious
situation

03:19:08.550 --> 03:19:08.560 align:start position:0%
situation
 
03:19:10.309 --> 03:19:10.319 align:start position:0%
for example a patient with a recent
 
03:19:13.110 --> 03:19:13.120 align:start position:0%
chest pain having investigated what
 
03:19:14.550 --> 03:19:14.560 align:start position:0%
blood tests might be ordered for
 
03:19:15.830 --> 03:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
somebody with chest pain they come
 
03:19:18.389 --> 03:19:18.399 align:start position:0%
across the troponin test and they order
 
03:19:18.399 --> 03:19:19.030 align:start position:0%
across the troponin test and they order
it

03:19:19.030 --> 03:19:19.040 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:19:20.710 --> 03:19:20.720 align:start position:0%
and to some extent it's elevated but
 
03:19:22.309 --> 03:19:22.319 align:start position:0%
they're feeling okay at the moment and
 
03:19:23.910 --> 03:19:23.920 align:start position:0%
they seek management with their primary
 
03:19:25.190 --> 03:19:25.200 align:start position:0%
care office
 
03:19:28.309 --> 03:19:28.319 align:start position:0%
this bill seems to as written make me
 
03:19:30.630 --> 03:19:30.640 align:start position:0%
upon hearing it not necessarily liable
 
03:19:31.830 --> 03:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
to treat
 
03:19:33.990 --> 03:19:34.000 align:start position:0%
this of course is not a tenable option
 
03:19:36.229 --> 03:19:36.239 align:start position:0%
medical providers once evaluating
 
03:19:38.070 --> 03:19:38.080 align:start position:0%
information on a patient must consider
 
03:19:38.080 --> 03:19:38.790 align:start position:0%
information on a patient must consider
it

03:19:38.790 --> 03:19:38.800 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:19:40.389 --> 03:19:40.399 align:start position:0%
first out of our oath and caring for our
 
03:19:41.670 --> 03:19:41.680 align:start position:0%
patients and trying to do the right
 
03:19:44.630 --> 03:19:44.640 align:start position:0%
thing and second medical legally
 
03:19:46.229 --> 03:19:46.239 align:start position:0%
so let's change the stakes from a heart
 
03:19:48.150 --> 03:19:48.160 align:start position:0%
attack to joint pain so a patient does
 
03:19:49.510 --> 03:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
some research on their own about what
 
03:19:51.110 --> 03:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
tests might be ordered if one has
 
03:19:52.870 --> 03:19:52.880 align:start position:0%
chronic pain of multiple joints and
 
03:19:55.190 --> 03:19:55.200 align:start position:0%
let's say amongst other tests they come
 
03:19:57.830 --> 03:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
down across an anti-nuclear antibody or
 
03:19:59.429 --> 03:19:59.439 align:start position:0%
an ana test
 
03:20:01.190 --> 03:20:01.200 align:start position:0%
the result is neither positive nor
 
03:20:03.670 --> 03:20:03.680 align:start position:0%
negative like many of our currently over
 
03:20:05.190 --> 03:20:05.200 align:start position:0%
you know available over-the-counter
 
03:20:07.830 --> 03:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
tests such as a covid19 test or a
 
03:20:10.389 --> 03:20:10.399 align:start position:0%
pregnancy test the a a is a titer a
 
03:20:12.070 --> 03:20:12.080 align:start position:0%
ratio and in addition it comes with
 
03:20:14.870 --> 03:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
various patterns and a positive test
 
03:20:17.030 --> 03:20:17.040 align:start position:0%
uh you know a present titer doesn't
 
03:20:19.349 --> 03:20:19.359 align:start position:0%
necessarily mean autoimmune disease is
 
03:20:19.359 --> 03:20:20.309 align:start position:0%
necessarily mean autoimmune disease is
present

03:20:20.309 --> 03:20:20.319 align:start position:0%
present
 
03:20:22.630 --> 03:20:22.640 align:start position:0%
so how do we reasonably expect patients
 
03:20:25.030 --> 03:20:25.040 align:start position:0%
to act upon those results where the
 
03:20:26.710 --> 03:20:26.720 align:start position:0%
action upon the result is going to
 
03:20:28.870 --> 03:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
hopefully achieve the goal which is
 
03:20:28.880 --> 03:20:30.389 align:start position:0%
hopefully achieve the goal which is
health

03:20:30.389 --> 03:20:30.399 align:start position:0%
health
 
03:20:32.229 --> 03:20:32.239 align:start position:0%
this issue of provider responsibility
 
03:20:33.750 --> 03:20:33.760 align:start position:0%
begs the question
 
03:20:36.150 --> 03:20:36.160 align:start position:0%
why give tools of medical diagnosis to
 
03:20:37.750 --> 03:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
patients who cannot administer the
 
03:20:39.830 --> 03:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
treatment to themselves especially if
 
03:20:41.590 --> 03:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
providers are absolved from dealing with
 
03:20:42.790 --> 03:20:42.800 align:start position:0%
the results
 
03:20:44.469 --> 03:20:44.479 align:start position:0%
you would let a patient either a
 
03:20:46.389 --> 03:20:46.399 align:start position:0%
discover a problem or b discover
 
03:20:48.389 --> 03:20:48.399 align:start position:0%
questions based on results
 
03:20:51.190 --> 03:20:51.200 align:start position:0%
and then legally isolate them from the
 
03:20:54.469 --> 03:20:54.479 align:start position:0%
provider of any stripe who might be
 
03:20:55.830 --> 03:20:55.840 align:start position:0%
available to attend to it that they
 
03:20:56.790 --> 03:20:56.800 align:start position:0%
would not be
 
03:20:58.630 --> 03:20:58.640 align:start position:0%
mandated to attend to it
 
03:21:00.229 --> 03:21:00.239 align:start position:0%
um of course they're going to present to
 
03:21:01.990 --> 03:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
us i think we know as family physicians
 
03:21:03.910 --> 03:21:03.920 align:start position:0%
as primary care providers as medical
 
03:21:05.670 --> 03:21:05.680 align:start position:0%
providers of venue stripe
 
03:21:06.950 --> 03:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
of course they're going to come with
 
03:21:08.870 --> 03:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
questions and
 
03:21:11.110 --> 03:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
we would not be able to ignore we and
 
03:21:12.790 --> 03:21:12.800 align:start position:0%
and that's because we're trying to help
 
03:21:14.389 --> 03:21:14.399 align:start position:0%
patients in need they're coming with a
 
03:21:17.429 --> 03:21:17.439 align:start position:0%
question if they get these results
 
03:21:18.870 --> 03:21:18.880 align:start position:0%
the last point we would make there is
 
03:21:20.710 --> 03:21:20.720 align:start position:0%
regarding patient billing so in parts
 
03:21:21.990 --> 03:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
five and six
 
03:21:23.910 --> 03:21:23.920 align:start position:0%
uh indicating that it does not compel
 
03:21:25.429 --> 03:21:25.439 align:start position:0%
insurance to cover lab testing not
 
03:21:27.269 --> 03:21:27.279 align:start position:0%
currently covered and that the lab shall
 
03:21:28.950 --> 03:21:28.960 align:start position:0%
not submit reimbursement claims to a
 
03:21:31.190 --> 03:21:31.200 align:start position:0%
payer many payers currently cover
 
03:21:32.790 --> 03:21:32.800 align:start position:0%
certain laboratory studies for patients
 
03:21:34.389 --> 03:21:34.399 align:start position:0%
on an annual basis if submitted through
 
03:21:36.150 --> 03:21:36.160 align:start position:0%
claims properly
 
03:21:37.510 --> 03:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
this would potentially create a system
 
03:21:39.110 --> 03:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
where patients may end up paying full
 
03:21:41.349 --> 03:21:41.359 align:start position:0%
cash price for labs that their insurance
 
03:21:43.349 --> 03:21:43.359 align:start position:0%
would otherwise cover if submitted from
 
03:21:45.269 --> 03:21:45.279 align:start position:0%
a medical provider thus creating an
 
03:21:47.830 --> 03:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity again for increased costs
 
03:21:49.429 --> 03:21:49.439 align:start position:0%
i think there's good intention and heart
 
03:21:51.190 --> 03:21:51.200 align:start position:0%
here as we've heard all throughout so
 
03:21:52.710 --> 03:21:52.720 align:start position:0%
far i've been in attendance sort of
 
03:21:54.550 --> 03:21:54.560 align:start position:0%
since the beginning this morning the
 
03:21:56.070 --> 03:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
goal and spirit of giving patients
 
03:21:58.150 --> 03:21:58.160 align:start position:0%
agency in their health care is is a very
 
03:22:00.309 --> 03:22:00.319 align:start position:0%
very good one but i think we have to
 
03:22:02.630 --> 03:22:02.640 align:start position:0%
consider what this specific wording in
 
03:22:04.870 --> 03:22:04.880 align:start position:0%
this bill mandates and codifies it
 
03:22:06.790 --> 03:22:06.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't give guidance as to which labs
 
03:22:08.710 --> 03:22:08.720 align:start position:0%
to which the law applies it indicates
 
03:22:09.990 --> 03:22:10.000 align:start position:0%
any lab
 
03:22:11.670 --> 03:22:11.680 align:start position:0%
and we've heard testimony about some
 
03:22:14.550 --> 03:22:14.560 align:start position:0%
labs being more appropriate for dat
 
03:22:16.150 --> 03:22:16.160 align:start position:0%
than others
 
03:22:18.469 --> 03:22:18.479 align:start position:0%
as i indicated before more labs do not
 
03:22:20.229 --> 03:22:20.239 align:start position:0%
equal more health and if it did i
 
03:22:22.710 --> 03:22:22.720 align:start position:0%
promise you we would try it out and we
 
03:22:24.150 --> 03:22:24.160 align:start position:0%
would have the best health outcomes
 
03:22:25.750 --> 03:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
because it's kind of what we already do
 
03:22:27.269 --> 03:22:27.279 align:start position:0%
here in the us
 
03:22:27.279 --> 03:22:28.389 align:start position:0%
here in the us
ultimately

03:22:28.389 --> 03:22:28.399 align:start position:0%
ultimately
 
03:22:30.790 --> 03:22:30.800 align:start position:0%
we don't feel that hb 381 empowers or
 
03:22:32.950 --> 03:22:32.960 align:start position:0%
enables patients so much as in many
 
03:22:34.870 --> 03:22:34.880 align:start position:0%
instances might strand them first
 
03:22:37.510 --> 03:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
leaving them a c and a drifting is he
 
03:22:39.030 --> 03:22:39.040 align:start position:0%
trying to interpret results without
 
03:22:41.670 --> 03:22:41.680 align:start position:0%
context or experience but based off of
 
03:22:44.229 --> 03:22:44.239 align:start position:0%
uh you know personal research alone
 
03:22:46.389 --> 03:22:46.399 align:start position:0%
and then even if the example was crystal
 
03:22:48.710 --> 03:22:48.720 align:start position:0%
clear the diagnosis was crystal clear
 
03:22:51.030 --> 03:22:51.040 align:start position:0%
leaves them without a provider to attend
 
03:22:52.550 --> 03:22:52.560 align:start position:0%
and treat they would have to make that
 
03:22:55.750 --> 03:22:55.760 align:start position:0%
request and by this bill would be
 
03:22:57.510 --> 03:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
allowed to refuse because they didn't
 
03:22:59.429 --> 03:22:59.439 align:start position:0%
order the test
 
03:23:02.070 --> 03:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
and so we felt that all of this if
 
03:23:03.750 --> 03:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
you're well enough well off enough to
 
03:23:05.910 --> 03:23:05.920 align:start position:0%
afford the cash price to begin with
 
03:23:08.229 --> 03:23:08.239 align:start position:0%
um so it we we don't feel that it
 
03:23:10.070 --> 03:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
balances the risk to patient safety and
 
03:23:12.469 --> 03:23:12.479 align:start position:0%
the notion of fiscal responsibility with
 
03:23:14.790 --> 03:23:14.800 align:start position:0%
the concept of the benefit of the agency
 
03:23:17.429 --> 03:23:17.439 align:start position:0%
which it seeks to to provide so we as
 
03:23:18.630 --> 03:23:18.640 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire academy of family
 
03:23:21.030 --> 03:23:21.040 align:start position:0%
physicians um you know urge opposition
 
03:23:23.750 --> 03:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
to hb 381 as written and we would be
 
03:23:25.110 --> 03:23:25.120 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions at this
 
03:23:27.349 --> 03:23:27.359 align:start position:0%
time and in the future should it arise
 
03:23:30.150 --> 03:23:30.160 align:start position:0%
in your deliberations
 
03:23:31.670 --> 03:23:31.680 align:start position:0%
does anybody on the committee have a
 
03:23:43.349 --> 03:23:43.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:46.070 --> 03:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
seeing none and exhausting the lists of
 
03:23:53.830 --> 03:23:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:59.510 --> 03:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:01.750 --> 03:24:01.760 align:start position:0%
house bill 381
 
03:24:03.510 --> 03:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
we will have
 
03:24:05.670 --> 03:24:05.680 align:start position:0%
uh half an hour
 
03:24:08.469 --> 03:24:08.479 align:start position:0%
recess lunch break and
 
03:24:10.950 --> 03:24:10.960 align:start position:0%
we'll pick up at one o'clock
 
03:24:13.830 --> 03:24:13.840 align:start position:0%
on house bill 503 establishing the new
 
03:24:16.389 --> 03:24:16.399 align:start position:0%
hampshire commission on homelessness
 
03:24:19.110 --> 03:24:19.120 align:start position:0%
and so particularly for representative
 
03:24:19.120 --> 03:24:20.309 align:start position:0%
and so particularly for representative
long

03:24:20.309 --> 03:24:20.319 align:start position:0%
long
 
03:24:20.319 --> 03:24:21.830 align:start position:0%
long
um

03:24:21.830 --> 03:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:24:21.840 --> 03:24:22.790 align:start position:0%
um
is

03:24:22.790 --> 03:24:22.800 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:24:24.630 --> 03:24:24.640 align:start position:0%
i'd like to know have you got this
 
03:24:27.590 --> 03:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
notice because if not we'll call you
 
03:24:28.790 --> 03:24:28.800 align:start position:0%
then we're going to pick we're going to
 
03:24:42.309 --> 03:24:42.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:44.469 --> 03:24:44.479 align:start position:0%
yeah that's fine mr chairman just wanted
 
03:24:46.710 --> 03:24:46.720 align:start position:0%
to make sure you and anybody else you
 
03:24:49.110 --> 03:24:49.120 align:start position:0%
especially wanted to have testify would
 
03:24:51.190 --> 03:24:51.200 align:start position:0%
know we're going to start at one
 
03:24:54.710 --> 03:24:54.720 align:start position:0%
very good thank you
 
03:25:28.870 --> 03:25:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:28.880 --> 03:57:10.870 align:start position:0%
 
here

03:57:10.870 --> 03:57:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:16.950 --> 03:57:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:20.870 --> 03:57:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:23.189 --> 03:57:23.199 align:start position:0%
okay i i guess they just haven't turned
 
03:57:25.110 --> 03:57:25.120 align:start position:0%
the sound on in the committee room yet
 
03:57:26.229 --> 03:57:26.239 align:start position:0%
thanks jim
 
03:57:28.630 --> 03:57:28.640 align:start position:0%
good to see you but by the way jim do
 
03:57:31.670 --> 03:57:31.680 align:start position:0%
you pronounce your name mckay or makai
 
03:57:35.590 --> 03:57:35.600 align:start position:0%
makai is the scottish way and see right
 
03:57:39.750 --> 03:57:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:42.870 --> 03:57:42.880 align:start position:0%
just halfway between i think
 
03:57:42.880 --> 03:57:43.910 align:start position:0%
just halfway between i think
right

03:57:43.910 --> 03:57:43.920 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:57:45.030 --> 03:57:45.040 align:start position:0%
but that
 
03:57:47.189 --> 03:57:47.199 align:start position:0%
that's there's a kinship there because
 
03:57:51.910 --> 03:57:51.920 align:start position:0%
of in the 1600s the campbell stole the
 
03:57:53.189 --> 03:57:53.199 align:start position:0%
land of
 
03:57:56.229 --> 03:57:56.239 align:start position:0%
the makai's and the
 
03:57:58.590 --> 03:57:58.600 align:start position:0%
and whatever his plan is you know
 
03:57:58.600 --> 03:57:59.750 align:start position:0%
and whatever his plan is you know
[Music]

03:57:59.750 --> 03:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:58:04.150 --> 03:58:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:05.990 --> 03:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
i gather the campbell's had a great deal
 
03:58:07.670 --> 03:58:07.680 align:start position:0%
to answer for
 
03:58:07.680 --> 03:58:09.429 align:start position:0%
to answer for
yeah

03:58:09.429 --> 03:58:09.439 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:58:11.830 --> 03:58:11.840 align:start position:0%
yeah it was it was in the highlands in
 
03:58:11.840 --> 03:58:14.710 align:start position:0%
yeah it was it was in the highlands in
scotland

03:58:14.710 --> 03:58:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:18.309 --> 03:58:18.319 align:start position:0%
are you home or are you in concord
 
03:58:20.630 --> 03:58:20.640 align:start position:0%
i'm in concord where i came because i
 
03:58:22.710 --> 03:58:22.720 align:start position:0%
thought that my internet might be more
 
03:58:24.950 --> 03:58:24.960 align:start position:0%
stable which is called being wrong
 
03:58:27.510 --> 03:58:27.520 align:start position:0%
because i am told that um
 
03:58:29.750 --> 03:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
friends in walpole said that walpole was
 
03:58:32.870 --> 03:58:32.880 align:start position:0%
just fine and of course i've been
 
03:58:36.309 --> 03:58:36.319 align:start position:0%
i've lost power three times here just
 
03:58:38.309 --> 03:58:38.319 align:start position:0%
long enough to cause all systems to
 
03:58:41.590 --> 03:58:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:43.510 --> 03:58:43.520 align:start position:0%
i thought i was doing myself a favor
 
03:58:46.229 --> 03:58:46.239 align:start position:0%
which turns out to have been wrong
 
03:58:48.150 --> 03:58:48.160 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
03:58:50.550 --> 03:58:50.560 align:start position:0%
i have a direct feed

i'm representative pat long

04:00:10.790 --> 04:00:10.800 align:start position:0%
city of manchester
 
04:00:12.550 --> 04:00:12.560 align:start position:0%
madam clark i forwarded my written
 
04:00:15.269 --> 04:00:15.279 align:start position:0%
testimony to your legislative email
 
04:00:17.429 --> 04:00:17.439 align:start position:0%
house bill 503 is an attempt to get the
 
04:00:19.189 --> 04:00:19.199 align:start position:0%
pulse on homelessness in the state of
 
04:00:20.630 --> 04:00:20.640 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
04:00:22.630 --> 04:00:22.640 align:start position:0%
as i go through my testimony i break
 
04:00:24.870 --> 04:00:24.880 align:start position:0%
down homelessness into two categories
 
04:00:26.870 --> 04:00:26.880 align:start position:0%
homelessness in my opinion
 
04:00:28.710 --> 04:00:28.720 align:start position:0%
is those living in this state with
 
04:00:31.189 --> 04:00:31.199 align:start position:0%
nowhere to call home
 
04:00:32.870 --> 04:00:32.880 align:start position:0%
they share housing units with other
 
04:00:34.870 --> 04:00:34.880 align:start position:0%
families live temporarily with family
 
04:00:37.510 --> 04:00:37.520 align:start position:0%
members or they may couchsurf or
 
04:00:39.590 --> 04:00:39.600 align:start position:0%
live live in their vehicles
 
04:00:41.670 --> 04:00:41.680 align:start position:0%
the other category is unsheltered at our
 
04:00:42.710 --> 04:00:42.720 align:start position:0%
own house
 
04:00:44.710 --> 04:00:44.720 align:start position:0%
these are people living on public
 
04:00:47.349 --> 04:00:47.359 align:start position:0%
property normally uh intense and also
 
04:00:49.349 --> 04:00:49.359 align:start position:0%
private property
 
04:00:51.990 --> 04:00:52.000 align:start position:0%
in 2006 legislators established a
 
04:00:53.990 --> 04:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
commission on homelessness
 
04:00:55.429 --> 04:00:55.439 align:start position:0%
and speaking with several members of
 
04:00:57.910 --> 04:00:57.920 align:start position:0%
that commission in 2008 during a
 
04:00:59.830 --> 04:00:59.840 align:start position:0%
downturn of the economy the commission
 
04:01:01.349 --> 04:01:01.359 align:start position:0%
stopped meeting
 
04:01:03.189 --> 04:01:03.199 align:start position:0%
today i believe each municipality
 
04:01:05.269 --> 04:01:05.279 align:start position:0%
dealing with homelessness are in their
 
04:01:08.150 --> 04:01:08.160 align:start position:0%
own silos attempting to find solution
 
04:01:10.070 --> 04:01:10.080 align:start position:0%
often these solutions are in addressing
 
04:01:13.189 --> 04:01:13.199 align:start position:0%
immediate needs as in un-housed winter
 
04:01:15.189 --> 04:01:15.199 align:start position:0%
shelters several municipalities have
 
04:01:17.910 --> 04:01:17.920 align:start position:0%
leased spaces temporarily for people to
 
04:01:19.670 --> 04:01:19.680 align:start position:0%
have a warm spot when the cold weather
 
04:01:21.830 --> 04:01:21.840 align:start position:0%
becomes too dangerous in remaining
 
04:01:21.840 --> 04:01:23.269 align:start position:0%
becomes too dangerous in remaining
outside

04:01:23.269 --> 04:01:23.279 align:start position:0%
outside
 
04:01:25.830 --> 04:01:25.840 align:start position:0%
in march of 2020 when new hampshire
 
04:01:28.229 --> 04:01:28.239 align:start position:0%
started dealing with cover 19
 
04:01:30.469 --> 04:01:30.479 align:start position:0%
unsheltered population in several cities
 
04:01:32.710 --> 04:01:32.720 align:start position:0%
increased substantially people were
 
04:01:35.429 --> 04:01:35.439 align:start position:0%
afraid to take people into their homes
 
04:01:37.429 --> 04:01:37.439 align:start position:0%
and the unsheltered were resistant to
 
04:01:39.429 --> 04:01:39.439 align:start position:0%
going into shelters
 
04:01:41.189 --> 04:01:41.199 align:start position:0%
i can speak for the city of manchester
 
04:01:43.269 --> 04:01:43.279 align:start position:0%
in april of 2020 data showed that
 
04:01:46.550 --> 04:01:46.560 align:start position:0%
manchester had roughly 200 unsheltered
 
04:01:49.670 --> 04:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
uh residents in july of 2020 the data
 
04:01:52.790 --> 04:01:52.800 align:start position:0%
showed roughly 250 and in october of
 
04:01:55.590 --> 04:01:55.600 align:start position:0%
2020 data showed 300 plus
 
04:01:57.349 --> 04:01:57.359 align:start position:0%
unsheltered people and encampments
 
04:01:59.429 --> 04:01:59.439 align:start position:0%
around the city of manchester
 
04:02:01.189 --> 04:02:01.199 align:start position:0%
outreach personnel in manchester
 
04:02:04.070 --> 04:02:04.080 align:start position:0%
identified 35 plus encampments
 
04:02:06.630 --> 04:02:06.640 align:start position:0%
including a new encampment settled in
 
04:02:08.309 --> 04:02:08.319 align:start position:0%
hillsborough superior court north in
 
04:02:08.319 --> 04:02:10.309 align:start position:0%
hillsborough superior court north in
manchester

04:02:10.309 --> 04:02:10.319 align:start position:0%
manchester
 
04:02:11.750 --> 04:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
currently there are several funding
 
04:02:13.110 --> 04:02:13.120 align:start position:0%
mechanisms that the state of new
 
04:02:15.750 --> 04:02:15.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire receives as in federal dollars
 
04:02:17.110 --> 04:02:17.120 align:start position:0%
passed through the state along with
 
04:02:19.030 --> 04:02:19.040 align:start position:0%
state appropriations
 
04:02:21.429 --> 04:02:21.439 align:start position:0%
in a letter dated from governor sununu
 
04:02:23.590 --> 04:02:23.600 align:start position:0%
on november 18th to mayors of new
 
04:02:26.229 --> 04:02:26.239 align:start position:0%
hampshire in response to their letter
 
04:02:29.510 --> 04:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
regarding challenges in homelessness
 
04:02:30.790 --> 04:02:30.800 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire department of health
 
04:02:32.790 --> 04:02:32.800 align:start position:0%
and human services and federal
 
04:02:35.830 --> 04:02:35.840 align:start position:0%
appropriations in four years equaled
 
04:02:37.429 --> 04:02:37.439 align:start position:0%
forty million three hundred and twenty
 
04:02:39.349 --> 04:02:39.359 align:start position:0%
one thousand nine hundred and twenty six
 
04:02:39.359 --> 04:02:40.550 align:start position:0%
one thousand nine hundred and twenty six
dollars

04:02:40.550 --> 04:02:40.560 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
04:02:43.110 --> 04:02:43.120 align:start position:0%
i believe that passage of house bill 503
 
04:02:45.510 --> 04:02:45.520 align:start position:0%
will immediately allow this commission
 
04:02:47.349 --> 04:02:47.359 align:start position:0%
to ensure public dollars are being
 
04:02:50.070 --> 04:02:50.080 align:start position:0%
expended at its highest level in best
 
04:02:52.870 --> 04:02:52.880 align:start position:0%
practice solution recommendations
 
04:02:54.550 --> 04:02:54.560 align:start position:0%
in december the new hampshire coalition
 
04:02:56.630 --> 04:02:56.640 align:start position:0%
to end homelessness released its annual
 
04:02:59.750 --> 04:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
report on the state of homelessness
 
04:03:01.189 --> 04:03:01.199 align:start position:0%
as reported in the new hampshire
 
04:03:03.510 --> 04:03:03.520 align:start position:0%

04:03:06.229 --> 04:03:06.239 align:start position:0%
state senate study sounds alarm on
 
04:03:08.150 --> 04:03:08.160 align:start position:0%
homeless tidal wave
 
04:03:11.510 --> 04:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
and it's january 15th to 28th 2021
 
04:03:11.520 --> 04:03:12.550 align:start position:0%
and it's january 15th to 28th 2021
edition

04:03:12.550 --> 04:03:12.560 align:start position:0%
edition
 
04:03:14.710 --> 04:03:14.720 align:start position:0%
the good news is there are no studies
 
04:03:17.110 --> 04:03:17.120 align:start position:0%
that need to be done we have all we need
 
04:03:19.510 --> 04:03:19.520 align:start position:0%
to begin immediately addressing best
 
04:03:21.110 --> 04:03:21.120 align:start position:0%
practice solution
 
04:03:23.590 --> 04:03:23.600 align:start position:0%
this commission through expertise can
 
04:03:26.070 --> 04:03:26.080 align:start position:0%
affect best practice positive change
 
04:03:26.080 --> 04:03:27.349 align:start position:0%
affect best practice positive change
immediately

04:03:27.349 --> 04:03:27.359 align:start position:0%
immediately
 
04:03:29.110 --> 04:03:29.120 align:start position:0%
the governor to his credit established
 
04:03:31.429 --> 04:03:31.439 align:start position:0%
through executive order a council on
 
04:03:33.670 --> 04:03:33.680 align:start position:0%
housing stability
 
04:03:35.429 --> 04:03:35.439 align:start position:0%
the meetings that i have attended lean
 
04:03:37.590 --> 04:03:37.600 align:start position:0%
more towards affordable housing an issue
 
04:03:40.469 --> 04:03:40.479 align:start position:0%
that absolutely needs this attention
 
04:03:42.389 --> 04:03:42.399 align:start position:0%
i am of the opinion affordable housing
 
04:03:44.229 --> 04:03:44.239 align:start position:0%
would not address the unsheltered of the
 
04:03:46.710 --> 04:03:46.720 align:start position:0%
homeless for that matter again speaking
 
04:03:48.710 --> 04:03:48.720 align:start position:0%
just within manchester outreach workers
 
04:03:51.429 --> 04:03:51.439 align:start position:0%
have identified over 80 percent of the
 
04:03:53.189 --> 04:03:53.199 align:start position:0%
unsheltered have underlying mental
 
04:03:55.830 --> 04:03:55.840 align:start position:0%
health service needs
 
04:03:57.429 --> 04:03:57.439 align:start position:0%
and the percentages increase
 
04:03:59.269 --> 04:03:59.279 align:start position:0%
substantially when you include substance
 
04:04:01.830 --> 04:04:01.840 align:start position:0%
use disorder these needs are imperative
 
04:04:03.910 --> 04:04:03.920 align:start position:0%
prior to addressing any services on
 
04:04:06.229 --> 04:04:06.239 align:start position:0%
independent living
 
04:04:08.790 --> 04:04:08.800 align:start position:0%
in closing we have implemented the tools
 
04:04:10.229 --> 04:04:10.239 align:start position:0%
in addressing mental health and
 
04:04:12.389 --> 04:04:12.399 align:start position:0%

program
 
04:04:18.389 --> 04:04:18.399 align:start position:0%
what we need now are experts to agree
 
04:04:20.070 --> 04:04:20.080 align:start position:0%
with the initiatives in stopping this
 
04:04:21.830 --> 04:04:21.840 align:start position:0%
tidal waves of unsheltered and
 
04:04:23.590 --> 04:04:23.600 align:start position:0%

um
 
04:05:41.030 --> 04:05:41.040 align:start position:0%
you know in
 
04:05:43.189 --> 04:05:43.199 align:start position:0%
in chichester i'm not about to move in
 
04:05:45.910 --> 04:05:45.920 align:start position:0%
the woods i'm going to go where there's
 
04:05:48.070 --> 04:05:48.080 align:start position:0%
a group that i can live with whether
 
04:05:51.910 --> 04:05:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:54.870 --> 04:05:54.880 align:start position:0%
dover or wherever so there is some
 
04:05:57.269 --> 04:05:57.279 align:start position:0%
information on that
 
04:05:59.830 --> 04:05:59.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:06:02.070 --> 04:06:02.080 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
04:06:05.030 --> 04:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
i see representative woods
 
04:06:06.710 --> 04:06:06.720 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair and thank you
 
04:06:09.189 --> 04:06:09.199 align:start position:0%
representative long um certainly i've
 
04:06:11.349 --> 04:06:11.359 align:start position:0%
been involved with the homelessness here
 
04:06:13.750 --> 04:06:13.760 align:start position:0%
in concord and greatly appreciate what
 
04:06:14.950 --> 04:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
you're doing
 
04:06:18.070 --> 04:06:18.080 align:start position:0%
uh in terms of efficacy and timeliness
 
04:06:18.080 --> 04:06:20.229 align:start position:0%
uh in terms of efficacy and timeliness
etc

04:06:20.229 --> 04:06:20.239 align:start position:0%
etc
 
04:06:22.309 --> 04:06:22.319 align:start position:0%
this seems to me move forward as you
 
04:06:24.469 --> 04:06:24.479 align:start position:0%
said immediately
 
04:06:27.269 --> 04:06:27.279 align:start position:0%
but sometimes things get uh bogged down
 
04:06:30.389 --> 04:06:30.399 align:start position:0%
uh my question centers around uh we have
 
04:06:33.349 --> 04:06:33.359 align:start position:0%
before is house bill 157 which is health
 
04:06:37.110 --> 04:06:37.120 align:start position:0%
care planning with a rather expansive um
 
04:06:39.110 --> 04:06:39.120 align:start position:0%
list of that commission
 
04:06:41.110 --> 04:06:41.120 align:start position:0%
are you familiar with that and if so
 
04:06:43.590 --> 04:06:43.600 align:start position:0%
would would that be a place that we
 
04:06:43.600 --> 04:06:44.389 align:start position:0%
would would that be a place that we
could

04:06:44.389 --> 04:06:44.399 align:start position:0%
could
 
04:06:46.389 --> 04:06:46.399 align:start position:0%
use as a subcommittee
 
04:06:48.870 --> 04:06:48.880 align:start position:0%
of that and
 
04:06:51.349 --> 04:06:51.359 align:start position:0%
instead of having a multitude of further
 
04:06:51.359 --> 04:06:53.030 align:start position:0%
instead of having a multitude of further
commissions

04:06:53.030 --> 04:06:53.040 align:start position:0%
commissions
 
04:06:53.910 --> 04:06:53.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
04:06:56.229 --> 04:06:56.239 align:start position:0%
representative i i um
 
04:06:59.110 --> 04:06:59.120 align:start position:0%
i i firmly believe that homelessness
 
04:07:01.910 --> 04:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
needs its own particular
 
04:07:01.920 --> 04:07:03.189 align:start position:0%
needs its own particular
um

04:07:03.189 --> 04:07:03.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:07:05.429 --> 04:07:05.439 align:start position:0%
advocacy group on that
 
04:07:07.910 --> 04:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
um i certainly understand i'm not
 
04:07:09.830 --> 04:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
familiar with the bill you mentioned
 
04:07:11.189 --> 04:07:11.199 align:start position:0%
um but
 
04:07:12.710 --> 04:07:12.720 align:start position:0%
you know i think it's
 
04:07:15.429 --> 04:07:15.439 align:start position:0%
it's been a long it's been long since
 
04:07:18.550 --> 04:07:18.560 align:start position:0%
new hampshire addressed cohesively
 
04:07:21.189 --> 04:07:21.199 align:start position:0%
uh homelessness
 
04:07:29.110 --> 04:07:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:32.150 --> 04:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:34.229 --> 04:07:34.239 align:start position:0%
representative gay
 
04:07:37.510 --> 04:07:37.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um
 
04:07:40.070 --> 04:07:40.080 align:start position:0%
senator senator
 
04:07:42.150 --> 04:07:42.160 align:start position:0%
representative long
 
04:07:44.070 --> 04:07:44.080 align:start position:0%
it's the real concern
 
04:07:44.080 --> 04:07:45.030 align:start position:0%
it's the real concern
that

04:07:45.030 --> 04:07:45.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:07:47.429 --> 04:07:47.439 align:start position:0%
shelters don't address this permanent
 
04:07:50.550 --> 04:07:50.560 align:start position:0%
housing i mean it's the real problem
 
04:07:52.309 --> 04:07:52.319 align:start position:0%
that these people
 
04:07:55.030 --> 04:07:55.040 align:start position:0%
are mentally ill or substance that
 
04:07:56.389 --> 04:07:56.399 align:start position:0%
suffers from
 
04:07:57.990 --> 04:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
substance abuse
 
04:08:01.990 --> 04:08:02.000 align:start position:0%
so just providing housing is not
 
04:08:05.349 --> 04:08:05.359 align:start position:0%
i mean the hardest that is that doesn't
 
04:08:08.389 --> 04:08:08.399 align:start position:0%
address the real problem
 
04:08:11.670 --> 04:08:11.680 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of excuse to deal with
 
04:08:12.710 --> 04:08:12.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
04:08:14.710 --> 04:08:14.720 align:start position:0%
representative gay i i uh i
 
04:08:16.870 --> 04:08:16.880 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly agree in my testimony i
 
04:08:18.710 --> 04:08:18.720 align:start position:0%
state that they're there there are
 
04:08:21.110 --> 04:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
unsheltered people that
 
04:08:22.630 --> 04:08:22.640 align:start position:0%
if we had
 
04:08:25.830 --> 04:08:25.840 align:start position:0%
20 000 affordable housing units
 
04:08:28.150 --> 04:08:28.160 align:start position:0%
everywhere in the state couldn't afford
 
04:08:30.469 --> 04:08:30.479 align:start position:0%
an affordable housing unit
 
04:08:33.269 --> 04:08:33.279 align:start position:0%
you know i know they're looking at uh 80
 
04:08:35.910 --> 04:08:35.920 align:start position:0%
medium income which in manchester is
 
04:08:38.710 --> 04:08:38.720 align:start position:0%
roughly 1500 a month
 
04:08:41.189 --> 04:08:41.199 align:start position:0%
um i i know several
 
04:08:43.110 --> 04:08:43.120 align:start position:0%
i know 80 of the people in the
 
04:08:45.910 --> 04:08:45.920 align:start position:0%
manchester unsheltered uh encampments
 
04:08:48.389 --> 04:08:48.399 align:start position:0%
would not be able to afford those so
 
04:08:50.550 --> 04:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
you know we first need to address
 
04:08:56.469 --> 04:08:56.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:59.670 --> 04:08:59.680 align:start position:0%
representative merchants
 
04:09:01.349 --> 04:09:01.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
04:09:04.229 --> 04:09:04.239 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
04:09:05.429 --> 04:09:05.439 align:start position:0%
and also for bringing this to our
 
04:09:07.349 --> 04:09:07.359 align:start position:0%
attention it's a very important
 
04:09:09.030 --> 04:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
societal issue that we have to face and
 
04:09:10.469 --> 04:09:10.479 align:start position:0%
particularly here with the pandemics i
 
04:09:12.150 --> 04:09:12.160 align:start position:0%
want to say thank you for bringing it
 
04:09:12.160 --> 04:09:13.269 align:start position:0%
want to say thank you for bringing it
forward

04:09:13.269 --> 04:09:13.279 align:start position:0%
forward
 
04:09:14.870 --> 04:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
and given
 
04:09:16.469 --> 04:09:16.479 align:start position:0%
the fact that we have a lot of data
 
04:09:18.790 --> 04:09:18.800 align:start position:0%
already in place
 
04:09:21.269 --> 04:09:21.279 align:start position:0%
dealing with this issue
 
04:09:22.790 --> 04:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
would it be better for us to have an ad
 
04:09:25.510 --> 04:09:25.520 align:start position:0%
hoc committee to create legislation in
 
04:09:26.630 --> 04:09:26.640 align:start position:0%
the fall
 
04:09:28.070 --> 04:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
to address the issue versus the
 
04:09:30.950 --> 04:09:30.960 align:start position:0%
commission that will take another year
 
04:09:32.229 --> 04:09:32.239 align:start position:0%
which then would drag it out another
 
04:09:33.429 --> 04:09:33.439 align:start position:0%
year after that
 
04:09:37.830 --> 04:09:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:39.189 --> 04:09:39.199 align:start position:0%
process issue as a question at that
 
04:09:40.469 --> 04:09:40.479 align:start position:0%
point in time if we already have a lot
 
04:09:42.790 --> 04:09:42.800 align:start position:0%
of data could we not speed this up by
 
04:09:44.710 --> 04:09:44.720 align:start position:0%
having an ad hoc committee and introduce
 
04:09:47.510 --> 04:09:47.520 align:start position:0%
legislation in the fall
 
04:09:48.550 --> 04:09:48.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question uh
 
04:09:51.429 --> 04:09:51.439 align:start position:0%
representative merchant i i um
 
04:09:52.630 --> 04:09:52.640 align:start position:0%
i don't believe we need added
 
04:09:54.389 --> 04:09:54.399 align:start position:0%
legislation i
 
04:09:56.469 --> 04:09:56.479 align:start position:0%
the money the 40 million dollars is out
 
04:09:58.309 --> 04:09:58.319 align:start position:0%
there currently
 
04:10:00.870 --> 04:10:00.880 align:start position:0%
and i think these experts on this
 
04:10:00.880 --> 04:10:02.070 align:start position:0%
and i think these experts on this
commission

04:10:02.070 --> 04:10:02.080 align:start position:0%
commission
 
04:10:04.550 --> 04:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
could um you know within their own
 
04:10:07.910 --> 04:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
entities form a new hampshire plan and
 
04:10:11.110 --> 04:10:11.120 align:start position:0%
have it implemented without legislative
 
04:10:13.750 --> 04:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
you know permission
 
04:10:18.389 --> 04:10:18.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:21.670 --> 04:10:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:23.349 --> 04:10:23.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
04:10:25.349 --> 04:10:25.359 align:start position:0%
thank you pat for
 
04:10:27.030 --> 04:10:27.040 align:start position:0%
bringing in this very important
 
04:10:27.040 --> 04:10:29.030 align:start position:0%
bringing in this very important
legislation

04:10:29.030 --> 04:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
04:10:30.630 --> 04:10:30.640 align:start position:0%
do you agree that
 
04:10:32.309 --> 04:10:32.319 align:start position:0%
people with
 
04:10:34.790 --> 04:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
severe mental illness addictions and
 
04:10:34.800 --> 04:10:36.710 align:start position:0%
severe mental illness addictions and
other

04:10:36.710 --> 04:10:36.720 align:start position:0%
other
 
04:10:38.710 --> 04:10:38.720 align:start position:0%
conditions like that
 
04:10:41.189 --> 04:10:41.199 align:start position:0%
make up a good part of the
 
04:10:41.199 --> 04:10:43.189 align:start position:0%
make up a good part of the
homeless

04:10:43.189 --> 04:10:43.199 align:start position:0%
homeless
 
04:10:46.070 --> 04:10:46.080 align:start position:0%
population and therefore the importance
 
04:10:46.080 --> 04:10:46.870 align:start position:0%
population and therefore the importance
of

04:10:46.870 --> 04:10:46.880 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:10:49.590 --> 04:10:49.600 align:start position:0%
coordination between
 
04:10:51.750 --> 04:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
the 10-year mental health plan for
 
04:10:54.469 --> 04:10:54.479 align:start position:0%
example and housing
 
04:10:56.309 --> 04:10:56.319 align:start position:0%
is a central issue
 
04:10:57.189 --> 04:10:57.199 align:start position:0%
in this
 
04:10:57.199 --> 04:10:58.550 align:start position:0%
in this
condition

04:10:58.550 --> 04:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
condition
 
04:11:01.670 --> 04:11:01.680 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you representative mckay i i
 
04:11:04.389 --> 04:11:04.399 align:start position:0%
certainly i certainly believe that those
 
04:11:07.670 --> 04:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
with mental health um
 
04:11:11.510 --> 04:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:13.750 --> 04:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
cannot on their own
 
04:11:17.110 --> 04:11:17.120 align:start position:0%
be responsible to manage getting into
 
04:11:19.670 --> 04:11:19.680 align:start position:0%
getting into somewhere so i believe they
 
04:11:22.309 --> 04:11:22.319 align:start position:0%
need their they need their hands held
 
04:11:25.590 --> 04:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
um uh just you know they need services
 
04:11:27.670 --> 04:11:27.680 align:start position:0%
mental health services and substance use
 
04:11:27.680 --> 04:11:28.630 align:start position:0%
mental health services and substance use
also

04:11:28.630 --> 04:11:28.640 align:start position:0%
also
 
04:11:29.910 --> 04:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
uh and
 
04:11:31.990 --> 04:11:32.000 align:start position:0%
they need their hands held into helping
 
04:11:32.000 --> 04:11:32.950 align:start position:0%
they need their hands held into helping
them

04:11:32.950 --> 04:11:32.960 align:start position:0%
them
 
04:11:34.630 --> 04:11:34.640 align:start position:0%
live independently
 
04:11:37.990 --> 04:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
um so you're absolutely right to to
 
04:11:39.750 --> 04:11:39.760 align:start position:0%
offer any benefits
 
04:11:42.229 --> 04:11:42.239 align:start position:0%
to any person that's unhoused with a
 
04:11:43.830 --> 04:11:43.840 align:start position:0%
mental health issue
 
04:11:45.510 --> 04:11:45.520 align:start position:0%
you know i'm of the opinion that they
 
04:11:47.750 --> 04:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
can't grasp that on their own it's
 
04:11:50.150 --> 04:11:50.160 align:start position:0%
they're dependent on us to
 
04:11:51.830 --> 04:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
hold their hand and walk them through
 
04:11:51.840 --> 04:11:54.469 align:start position:0%
hold their hand and walk them through
that

04:11:54.469 --> 04:11:54.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:58.630 --> 04:11:58.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:02.469 --> 04:12:02.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:04.469 --> 04:12:04.479 align:start position:0%
representative gay
 
04:12:06.389 --> 04:12:06.399 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
04:12:06.399 --> 04:12:11.269 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
um

04:12:11.269 --> 04:12:11.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:12.550 --> 04:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
do you think
 
04:12:14.229 --> 04:12:14.239 align:start position:0%
it's possible
 
04:12:15.990 --> 04:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
to do a combination of what was
 
04:12:18.790 --> 04:12:18.800 align:start position:0%
suggested start with an ad hoc and start
 
04:12:18.800 --> 04:12:20.309 align:start position:0%
suggested start with an ad hoc and start
now

04:12:20.309 --> 04:12:20.319 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:12:21.670 --> 04:12:21.680 align:start position:0%
and then
 
04:12:24.630 --> 04:12:24.640 align:start position:0%
when when a commission could be
 
04:12:27.349 --> 04:12:27.359 align:start position:0%
go into what you know start working
 
04:12:29.510 --> 04:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
transition so the addressing could
 
04:12:32.550 --> 04:12:32.560 align:start position:0%
happen now or do you think the funding
 
04:12:34.070 --> 04:12:34.080 align:start position:0%
won't happen
 
04:12:34.080 --> 04:12:35.349 align:start position:0%
won't happen
unless

04:12:35.349 --> 04:12:35.359 align:start position:0%
unless
 
04:12:35.359 --> 04:12:36.070 align:start position:0%
unless
the

04:12:36.070 --> 04:12:36.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:12:36.080 --> 04:12:38.229 align:start position:0%
the
the

04:12:38.229 --> 04:12:38.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:12:38.239 --> 04:12:38.950 align:start position:0%
the
that

04:12:38.950 --> 04:12:38.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:12:41.189 --> 04:12:41.199 align:start position:0%
or do you think that an ad hoc
 
04:12:44.070 --> 04:12:44.080 align:start position:0%
committee could not get the funding to
 
04:12:44.080 --> 04:12:45.189 align:start position:0%
committee could not get the funding to
be

04:12:45.189 --> 04:12:45.199 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:12:46.630 --> 04:12:46.640 align:start position:0%
starting to address the problem right
 
04:12:46.640 --> 04:12:47.510 align:start position:0%
starting to address the problem right
now

04:12:47.510 --> 04:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:12:49.830 --> 04:12:49.840 align:start position:0%
and then the other concern i have
 
04:12:53.189 --> 04:12:53.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:54.389 --> 04:12:54.399 align:start position:0%
are there
 
04:12:56.870 --> 04:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
other patterns that we could follow
 
04:12:58.630 --> 04:12:58.640 align:start position:0%
because my understanding is that a lot
 
04:13:01.510 --> 04:13:01.520 align:start position:0%
of people who are in this category
 
04:13:01.520 --> 04:13:02.630 align:start position:0%
of people who are in this category
mentally

04:13:02.630 --> 04:13:02.640 align:start position:0%
mentally
 
04:13:04.389 --> 04:13:04.399 align:start position:0%
are emotionally
 
04:13:04.399 --> 04:13:05.670 align:start position:0%
are emotionally
ill

04:13:05.670 --> 04:13:05.680 align:start position:0%
ill
 
04:13:07.510 --> 04:13:07.520 align:start position:0%
are scared to death they won't even go
 
04:13:10.229 --> 04:13:10.239 align:start position:0%
into a shelter they're so fearful
 
04:13:13.830 --> 04:13:13.840 align:start position:0%
so are there some patterns we can follow
 
04:13:17.349 --> 04:13:17.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:18.550 --> 04:13:18.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
04:13:20.469 --> 04:13:20.479 align:start position:0%
representative i mean as far as an ad
 
04:13:21.830 --> 04:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
hoc committee
 
04:13:23.990 --> 04:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
you know once again there's there's uh
 
04:13:25.189 --> 04:13:25.199 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:13:27.510 --> 04:13:27.520 align:start position:0%
i mean i have 19 members
 
04:13:29.990 --> 04:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh and there's a possibility of a 22
 
04:13:32.469 --> 04:13:32.479 align:start position:0%
member but these are all experts in
 
04:13:34.950 --> 04:13:34.960 align:start position:0%
specific care whether it's mental health
 
04:13:36.309 --> 04:13:36.319 align:start position:0%
substance use
 
04:13:38.550 --> 04:13:38.560 align:start position:0%
uh unhoused shelters
 
04:13:41.590 --> 04:13:41.600 align:start position:0%
um training in job security
 
04:13:44.309 --> 04:13:44.319 align:start position:0%
um you know training and budgeting these
 
04:13:46.229 --> 04:13:46.239 align:start position:0%
these are all the experts that already
 
04:13:47.830 --> 04:13:47.840 align:start position:0%
have all the data
 
04:13:51.990 --> 04:13:52.000 align:start position:0%
with which to implement um a cohesive
 
04:13:55.830 --> 04:13:55.840 align:start position:0%
um state plan um so
 
04:13:57.590 --> 04:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
with respect to the first part of the
 
04:13:58.870 --> 04:13:58.880 align:start position:0%
question i
 
04:14:00.950 --> 04:14:00.960 align:start position:0%
you know i i think this commission is a
 
04:14:03.750 --> 04:14:03.760 align:start position:0%
good commission to be able to deliver in
 
04:14:06.309 --> 04:14:06.319 align:start position:0%
that they're they're already trying in
 
04:14:08.710 --> 04:14:08.720 align:start position:0%
their silos to get that done now
 
04:14:11.590 --> 04:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
uh and there is money coming and there's
 
04:14:13.110 --> 04:14:13.120 align:start position:0%
every year there's money coming to
 
04:14:15.510 --> 04:14:15.520 align:start position:0%
homelessness um
 
04:14:17.590 --> 04:14:17.600 align:start position:0%
i mean it appears there's 10 million a
 
04:14:19.030 --> 04:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
year coming from
 
04:14:23.110 --> 04:14:23.120 align:start position:0%
dhhs and uh the federal appropriations
 
04:14:24.870 --> 04:14:24.880 align:start position:0%
uh and with respect to shelters you're
 
04:14:26.309 --> 04:14:26.319 align:start position:0%
absolutely right that
 
04:14:28.550 --> 04:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
you know the people that i've spoken to
 
04:14:29.830 --> 04:14:29.840 align:start position:0%
on houzz
 
04:14:29.840 --> 04:14:30.790 align:start position:0%
on houzz
that

04:14:30.790 --> 04:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:14:33.030 --> 04:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
i'm not a psychiatrist but
 
04:14:35.510 --> 04:14:35.520 align:start position:0%
i i know there's something
 
04:14:35.520 --> 04:14:36.710 align:start position:0%
i i know there's something
not

04:14:36.710 --> 04:14:36.720 align:start position:0%
not
 
04:14:36.720 --> 04:14:38.870 align:start position:0%
not
right

04:14:38.870 --> 04:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:14:40.710 --> 04:14:40.720 align:start position:0%
do not want to go with the shelter
 
04:14:43.429 --> 04:14:43.439 align:start position:0%
they don't even want to talk to me
 
04:14:45.830 --> 04:14:45.840 align:start position:0%
you know however our outreach people
 
04:14:48.790 --> 04:14:48.800 align:start position:0%
have been successful in
 
04:14:52.309 --> 04:14:52.319 align:start position:0%
getting a relationship with them and
 
04:15:00.469 --> 04:15:00.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:02.469 --> 04:15:02.479 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:15:04.710 --> 04:15:04.720 align:start position:0%

thank you i'm sorry i've introduced got
 
04:15:07.830 --> 04:15:07.840 align:start position:0%
into this lady
 
04:15:09.830 --> 04:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
would a police somebody representing the
 
04:15:11.590 --> 04:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
police department be a good member of a
 
04:15:11.600 --> 04:15:12.630 align:start position:0%
police department be a good member of a
commission

04:15:12.630 --> 04:15:12.640 align:start position:0%
commission
 
04:15:15.510 --> 04:15:15.520 align:start position:0%
or whatever you set up
 
04:15:17.189 --> 04:15:17.199 align:start position:0%
not somebody against the homeless
 
04:15:18.870 --> 04:15:18.880 align:start position:0%
obviously but somebody that's out on the
 
04:15:20.389 --> 04:15:20.399 align:start position:0%
street working
 
04:15:21.830 --> 04:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
with the homeless and dealing with the
 
04:15:24.309 --> 04:15:24.319 align:start position:0%
issues from their perspective
 
04:15:25.750 --> 04:15:25.760 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative for the
 
04:15:28.309 --> 04:15:28.319 align:start position:0%
question i i um
 
04:15:30.550 --> 04:15:30.560 align:start position:0%
i mean the only experience i know
 
04:15:33.189 --> 04:15:33.199 align:start position:0%
within police departments is the
 
04:15:36.070 --> 04:15:36.080 align:start position:0%
enforcement of
 
04:15:38.710 --> 04:15:38.720 align:start position:0%
unhoused sleeping on sidewalks and in
 
04:15:38.720 --> 04:15:39.750 align:start position:0%
unhoused sleeping on sidewalks and in
private

04:15:39.750 --> 04:15:39.760 align:start position:0%

04:15:45.189 --> 04:15:45.199 align:start position:0%
um i
 
04:15:47.670 --> 04:15:47.680 align:start position:0%
i mean i'm not i'm not sure uh with
 
04:15:49.990 --> 04:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
respect to a
 
04:15:51.830 --> 04:15:51.840 align:start position:0%
cohesive plan
 
04:15:53.269 --> 04:15:53.279 align:start position:0%
uh put forth for the state of new
 
04:15:55.670 --> 04:15:55.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire i'm not sure i mean i i could
 
04:15:57.990 --> 04:15:58.000 align:start position:0%
be wrong but i'm not sure that they fit
 
04:16:00.790 --> 04:16:00.800 align:start position:0%
into this category
 
04:16:05.110 --> 04:16:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:07.590 --> 04:16:07.600 align:start position:0%
any other questions for representative

any other questions for representative
law

04:16:12.550 --> 04:16:12.560 align:start position:0%

04:16:41.990 --> 04:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
representatives of the community or the
 
04:16:44.550 --> 04:16:44.560 align:start position:0%
committee sorry my name is patrick ho i
 
04:16:45.910 --> 04:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
am the president of the new hampshire
 
04:16:48.309 --> 04:16:48.319 align:start position:0%
psychiatric society my testimony today
 
04:16:50.389 --> 04:16:50.399 align:start position:0%
is on behalf of both the new hampshire
 
04:16:52.469 --> 04:16:52.479 align:start position:0%
psychiatric society as well as the new
 
04:16:54.550 --> 04:16:54.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire medical society where i also
 
04:16:56.950 --> 04:16:56.960 align:start position:0%
serve as an executive council member
 
04:16:59.269 --> 04:16:59.279 align:start position:0%
um i'll keep my testimony short today
 
04:17:01.590 --> 04:17:01.600 align:start position:0%
and also stick around for question uh
 
04:17:03.510 --> 04:17:03.520 align:start position:0%
questions but i think as we see the
 
04:17:05.110 --> 04:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
numbers of children and adults around
 
04:17:06.469 --> 04:17:06.479 align:start position:0%
the state waiting in emergency
 
04:17:08.389 --> 04:17:08.399 align:start position:0%
departments for admission to an
 
04:17:10.550 --> 04:17:10.560 align:start position:0%
inpatient psychiatric unit this is a
 
04:17:12.070 --> 04:17:12.080 align:start position:0%
stark reminder that we lack the
 
04:17:14.229 --> 04:17:14.239 align:start position:0%
resources to care for not only the
 
04:17:16.389 --> 04:17:16.399 align:start position:0%
mental health needs of our citizens but
 
04:17:18.229 --> 04:17:18.239 align:start position:0%
also the health-related social needs of
 
04:17:19.590 --> 04:17:19.600 align:start position:0%
our citizens
 
04:17:21.110 --> 04:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
it is not infrequent that homeless
 
04:17:22.870 --> 04:17:22.880 align:start position:0%
people who feel that they have no other
 
04:17:24.630 --> 04:17:24.640 align:start position:0%
options but to come to their nearest
 
04:17:26.550 --> 04:17:26.560 align:start position:0%
emergency department
 
04:17:28.870 --> 04:17:28.880 align:start position:0%
where oftentimes they will be evaluated
 
04:17:31.189 --> 04:17:31.199 align:start position:0%
by psychiatry find themselves in the
 
04:17:33.349 --> 04:17:33.359 align:start position:0%
long queue awaiting a psychiatric
 
04:17:34.950 --> 04:17:34.960 align:start position:0%
inpatient bed
 
04:17:36.790 --> 04:17:36.800 align:start position:0%
i think that a commission to study
 
04:17:38.229 --> 04:17:38.239 align:start position:0%
homelessness in our state would be
 
04:17:40.070 --> 04:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
potentially a very valuable intervention
 
04:17:42.070 --> 04:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
that could make recommendations on how
 
04:17:43.990 --> 04:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
we might provide more resources for
 
04:17:45.990 --> 04:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
those who are homeless other than
 
04:17:48.309 --> 04:17:48.319 align:start position:0%
already sparse emergency department beds
 
04:17:50.550 --> 04:17:50.560 align:start position:0%
and psychiatric inpatient beds the new
 
04:17:52.149 --> 04:17:52.159 align:start position:0%
hampshire psychiatric society and the
 
04:17:54.070 --> 04:17:54.080 align:start position:0%
new hampshire medical society do support
 
04:17:56.870 --> 04:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
this bill and as uh representative long
 
04:17:59.189 --> 04:17:59.199 align:start position:0%
had mentioned before we we also believe
 
04:18:00.870 --> 04:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
that and would request that a
 
04:18:02.469 --> 04:18:02.479 align:start position:0%
psychiatrist be included on this
 
04:18:04.229 --> 04:18:04.239 align:start position:0%
commission due to the high co-occurrence
 
04:18:05.990 --> 04:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
of homeless homelessness and mental
 
04:18:07.269 --> 04:18:07.279 align:start position:0%
health disorders
 
04:18:09.030 --> 04:18:09.040 align:start position:0%
i thank you for your time and and am
 
04:18:12.070 --> 04:18:12.080 align:start position:0%
available for any questions
 
04:18:20.469 --> 04:18:20.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:22.790 --> 04:18:22.800 align:start position:0%
gay thank you mr chairman
 
04:18:27.590 --> 04:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
um dr dr is there um is there a i keep
 
04:18:29.830 --> 04:18:29.840 align:start position:0%
using the word pattern but i mean an
 
04:18:29.840 --> 04:18:31.189 align:start position:0%
using the word pattern but i mean an
example

04:18:31.189 --> 04:18:31.199 align:start position:0%
example
 
04:18:31.199 --> 04:18:31.990 align:start position:0%
example
of

04:18:31.990 --> 04:18:32.000 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:18:34.710 --> 04:18:34.720 align:start position:0%
you know is
 
04:18:36.389 --> 04:18:36.399 align:start position:0%
is this
 
04:18:36.399 --> 04:18:37.750 align:start position:0%
is this
basically

04:18:37.750 --> 04:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
basically
 
04:18:40.710 --> 04:18:40.720 align:start position:0%
the issue that we just don't provide
 
04:18:42.469 --> 04:18:42.479 align:start position:0%
enough psychiatric
 
04:18:42.479 --> 04:18:43.910 align:start position:0%
enough psychiatric
care

04:18:43.910 --> 04:18:43.920 align:start position:0%
care
 
04:18:47.110 --> 04:18:47.120 align:start position:0%
and hospitals for all the people
 
04:18:49.590 --> 04:18:49.600 align:start position:0%
who need it
 
04:18:53.269 --> 04:18:53.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:54.149 --> 04:18:54.159 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
04:18:56.469 --> 04:18:56.479 align:start position:0%
representative gay um i i think that
 
04:18:59.030 --> 04:18:59.040 align:start position:0%
what we see here is is certainly a
 
04:19:00.790 --> 04:19:00.800 align:start position:0%
bi-directional phenomenon and a
 
04:19:02.950 --> 04:19:02.960 align:start position:0%
bi-directional issue and what i mean by
 
04:19:05.910 --> 04:19:05.920 align:start position:0%
that is that certainly not everybody who
 
04:19:08.870 --> 04:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
is homeless has a mental health disorder
 
04:19:10.950 --> 04:19:10.960 align:start position:0%
um and and certainly not everybody that
 
04:19:13.590 --> 04:19:13.600 align:start position:0%
has a mental health disorder is homeless
 
04:19:15.269 --> 04:19:15.279 align:start position:0%
and i think what we see is that those
 
04:19:17.830 --> 04:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
who are homeless oftentimes as a result
 
04:19:17.840 --> 04:19:18.950 align:start position:0%
who are homeless oftentimes as a result
of

04:19:18.950 --> 04:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:19:21.189 --> 04:19:21.199 align:start position:0%
many social needs that that lead to
 
04:19:23.750 --> 04:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
homelessness do develop mental health
 
04:19:26.950 --> 04:19:26.960 align:start position:0%
disorders and or substance use disorders
 
04:19:29.830 --> 04:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
and oftentimes because of the the rigors
 
04:19:32.710 --> 04:19:32.720 align:start position:0%
of mental health disorders then many
 
04:19:34.309 --> 04:19:34.319 align:start position:0%
people who have mental health disorders
 
04:19:37.269 --> 04:19:37.279 align:start position:0%
do become homeless as well so i think
 
04:19:38.790 --> 04:19:38.800 align:start position:0%
that um
 
04:19:42.309 --> 04:19:42.319 align:start position:0%
instead of focusing on um on hospital
 
04:19:44.870 --> 04:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
capacity which is something we've done
 
04:19:46.309 --> 04:19:46.319 align:start position:0%
in the past and something that's proven
 
04:19:47.189 --> 04:19:47.199 align:start position:0%
to be
 
04:19:49.670 --> 04:19:49.680 align:start position:0%
really costly and ineffective i think
 
04:19:52.149 --> 04:19:52.159 align:start position:0%
instead trying to prevent the occurrence
 
04:19:54.710 --> 04:19:54.720 align:start position:0%
of mental health disorders by providing
 
04:19:57.030 --> 04:19:57.040 align:start position:0%
resources for those who need it
 
04:19:59.110 --> 04:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
would be certainly money well spent and
 
04:20:00.950 --> 04:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
also inefficient use of such a
 
04:20:00.960 --> 04:20:04.070 align:start position:0%
also inefficient use of such a
commission

04:20:04.070 --> 04:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:05.590 --> 04:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:20:11.349 --> 04:20:11.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:13.110 --> 04:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
see no further questions thank you sir
 
04:20:17.830 --> 04:20:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:20.070 --> 04:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
and the last one on my list who signed
 
04:20:22.550 --> 04:20:22.560 align:start position:0%

hi can you hear me welcome back
 
04:20:51.429 --> 04:20:51.439 align:start position:0%

04:20:57.269 --> 04:20:57.279 align:start position:0%
biandalilo i'm 14. i live in manchester
 
04:20:58.710 --> 04:20:58.720 align:start position:0%
and i'm speaking today on behalf of the
 
04:21:00.070 --> 04:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
new hampshire high school democrats in
 
04:21:02.550 --> 04:21:02.560 align:start position:0%
support of hb503
 
04:21:03.750 --> 04:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
um i know that we're pretty behind
 
04:21:05.510 --> 04:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
schedule so i will keep this short um
 
04:21:07.110 --> 04:21:07.120 align:start position:0%
but i'm sure that many of you are aware
 
04:21:08.229 --> 04:21:08.239 align:start position:0%
of what happened just before
 
04:21:10.710 --> 04:21:10.720 align:start position:0%
thanksgiving last year in 2020
 
04:21:11.670 --> 04:21:11.680 align:start position:0%
if you're not though there was a
 
04:21:13.269 --> 04:21:13.279 align:start position:0%
situation where
 
04:21:14.790 --> 04:21:14.800 align:start position:0%
maybe half a dozen or a dozen homeless
 
04:21:16.870 --> 04:21:16.880 align:start position:0%
people were temporarily housed outside
 
04:21:18.309 --> 04:21:18.319 align:start position:0%
of the hillsborough county courthouse in
 
04:21:20.630 --> 04:21:20.640 align:start position:0%
manchester and state police arrived in
 
04:21:22.550 --> 04:21:22.560 align:start position:0%
late november to practically try to
 
04:21:23.910 --> 04:21:23.920 align:start position:0%
evict them
 
04:21:25.269 --> 04:21:25.279 align:start position:0%
according to witnesses who were there at
 
04:21:26.550 --> 04:21:26.560 align:start position:0%
the time and a few videos that were
 
04:21:28.149 --> 04:21:28.159 align:start position:0%
taken the state police actually ripped
 
04:21:29.510 --> 04:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
the tents people had made there they
 
04:21:30.870 --> 04:21:30.880 align:start position:0%
threw away personal belongings and they
 
04:21:32.870 --> 04:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
caused a lot of turmoil there and all
 
04:21:34.070 --> 04:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
this was just a few days after the
 
04:21:35.429 --> 04:21:35.439 align:start position:0%
notice was posted that they were going
 
04:21:37.030 --> 04:21:37.040 align:start position:0%
to arrive so there was very little time
 
04:21:38.870 --> 04:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
for these people to relocate before
 
04:21:40.309 --> 04:21:40.319 align:start position:0%
again their possessions were thrown away
 
04:21:42.149 --> 04:21:42.159 align:start position:0%
and their homes were destroyed
 
04:21:43.830 --> 04:21:43.840 align:start position:0%
um i think this commission would help us
 
04:21:45.429 --> 04:21:45.439 align:start position:0%
find out more about why people are being
 
04:21:47.110 --> 04:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
forced to stay outside and find a better
 
04:21:48.550 --> 04:21:48.560 align:start position:0%
solution so that we can prevent things
 
04:21:50.309 --> 04:21:50.319 align:start position:0%
like this from happening again that
 
04:21:52.070 --> 04:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
would not only be a huge improvement for
 
04:21:53.590 --> 04:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
our houseless neighbors but it would
 
04:21:55.349 --> 04:21:55.359 align:start position:0%
also allow us to improve our communities
 
04:21:56.870 --> 04:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
and help people feel more in touch with
 
04:21:59.110 --> 04:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
their neighborhoods and where they live
 
04:22:00.870 --> 04:22:00.880 align:start position:0%
i can also say definitely that this is
 
04:22:02.630 --> 04:22:02.640 align:start position:0%
an issue that affects youth particularly
 
04:22:03.830 --> 04:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
because not only are there a lot of
 
04:22:05.590 --> 04:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
children and adolescents that are forced
 
04:22:07.269 --> 04:22:07.279 align:start position:0%
into unfortunate living situations
 
04:22:07.279 --> 04:22:08.229 align:start position:0%
into unfortunate living situations
because

04:22:08.229 --> 04:22:08.239 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:22:09.670 --> 04:22:09.680 align:start position:0%
their parents aren't able to support a
 
04:22:11.189 --> 04:22:11.199 align:start position:0%
family or whatever other reasons that
 
04:22:13.189 --> 04:22:13.199 align:start position:0%
are outside of their control um but also
 
04:22:14.550 --> 04:22:14.560 align:start position:0%
because there are a lot of runaway teens
 
04:22:15.910 --> 04:22:15.920 align:start position:0%
who have to escape their family
 
04:22:18.149 --> 04:22:18.159 align:start position:0%
situations and that causes them to live
 
04:22:19.830 --> 04:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
outside of the home so as a home as a
 
04:22:20.950 --> 04:22:20.960 align:start position:0%
high schooler
 
04:22:22.070 --> 04:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
i can definitely say that this bill
 
04:22:23.910 --> 04:22:23.920 align:start position:0%
would help us find a way to help a lot
 
04:22:25.910 --> 04:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
of people find stability and be able to
 
04:22:28.229 --> 04:22:28.239 align:start position:0%
get back into better situations so
 
04:22:29.510 --> 04:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
overall i think it's a really great bill
 
04:22:31.030 --> 04:22:31.040 align:start position:0%
that's very nonpartisan and i asked the
 
04:22:33.590 --> 04:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
committee to recommend octopass on hp503
 
04:22:41.269 --> 04:22:41.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:43.510 --> 04:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
i don't see any questions but thank you
 
04:22:50.070 --> 04:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:52.870 --> 04:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
with that i see no one else on my list
 
04:22:52.880 --> 04:22:54.710 align:start position:0%
with that i see no one else on my list
or

04:22:54.710 --> 04:22:54.720 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:22:54.720 --> 04:22:56.630 align:start position:0%
or
nothing

04:22:56.630 --> 04:22:56.640 align:start position:0%
nothing
 
04:22:56.640 --> 04:22:59.030 align:start position:0%
nothing
so

04:22:59.030 --> 04:22:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:00.389 --> 04:23:00.399 align:start position:0%
chairman pearson there are two people
 
04:23:01.910 --> 04:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
who do have their hands up if you'd like
 
04:23:04.550 --> 04:23:04.560 align:start position:0%
to recognize them
 
04:23:07.030 --> 04:23:07.040 align:start position:0%
oh okay i have information to the
 
04:23:09.590 --> 04:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
contrary but uh let me call in on molly
 
04:23:09.600 --> 04:23:16.870 align:start position:0%
contrary but uh let me call in on molly
lynch

04:23:16.870 --> 04:23:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:19.349 --> 04:23:19.359 align:start position:0%
good afternoon everyone my name is molly
 
04:23:21.110 --> 04:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
lynch i'm an attorney with the
 
04:23:23.189 --> 04:23:23.199 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
04:23:25.269 --> 04:23:25.279 align:start position:0%
and i am also a legislative liaison with
 
04:23:26.469 --> 04:23:26.479 align:start position:0%
the department
 
04:23:29.030 --> 04:23:29.040 align:start position:0%
the department uh respectfully opposes
 
04:23:33.510 --> 04:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
um hb 503 um you know we recognize um we
 
04:23:35.269 --> 04:23:35.279 align:start position:0%
i heard the testimony from the prior
 
04:23:37.590 --> 04:23:37.600 align:start position:0%
speakers and you know we share their
 
04:23:39.830 --> 04:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
concerns however we feel that it is
 
04:23:41.910 --> 04:23:41.920 align:start position:0%
duplicative of the comprehensive work
 
04:23:43.910 --> 04:23:43.920 align:start position:0%
that is being done by the council on
 
04:23:46.710 --> 04:23:46.720 align:start position:0%
housing stability enacted in november
 
04:23:49.910 --> 04:23:49.920 align:start position:0%
2020 by executive order the department
 
04:23:51.910 --> 04:23:51.920 align:start position:0%
feels creating an additional commission
 
04:23:55.429 --> 04:23:55.439 align:start position:0%
is not necessary it will strain dhhs
 
04:23:57.590 --> 04:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
staff resources and also have the

potential to create dual plans for

homelessness which will not help solve

side by side
 
04:27:42.790 --> 04:27:42.800 align:start position:0%
with on one's hand
 
04:27:46.710 --> 04:27:46.720 align:start position:0%
page two of house bill 503

housing stability council
 
04:28:02.149 --> 04:28:02.159 align:start position:0%
did you do a side by side to see how
 
04:28:04.469 --> 04:28:04.479 align:start position:0%
they match up
 
04:28:09.830 --> 04:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:13.429 --> 04:28:13.439 align:start position:0%

miss lynch for taking my question
 
04:28:20.790 --> 04:28:20.800 align:start position:0%
with all the work that's been done
 
04:28:22.870 --> 04:28:22.880 align:start position:0%
by the council i want to say thank you
 
04:28:24.550 --> 04:28:24.560 align:start position:0%
for getting the work done
 
04:28:27.429 --> 04:28:27.439 align:start position:0%
one of the things also in house bill 503
 
04:28:29.269 --> 04:28:29.279 align:start position:0%
on the second page
 
04:28:30.710 --> 04:28:30.720 align:start position:0%
is a question about recommendation with
 
04:28:30.720 --> 04:28:32.309 align:start position:0%
is a question about recommendation with
legislation

04:28:32.309 --> 04:28:32.319 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
04:28:32.319 --> 04:28:33.189 align:start position:0%
legislation
so

04:28:33.189 --> 04:28:33.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:28:35.110 --> 04:28:35.120 align:start position:0%
given all the work that's been done what
 
04:28:36.870 --> 04:28:36.880 align:start position:0%
recommendations for legislation has come
 
04:28:42.389 --> 04:28:42.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:44.309 --> 04:28:44.319 align:start position:0%
the council i believe has deliverables
 
04:28:45.670 --> 04:28:45.680 align:start position:0%
due in
 
04:28:45.680 --> 04:28:47.349 align:start position:0%
due in
june

04:28:47.349 --> 04:28:47.359 align:start position:0%
june
 
04:28:54.630 --> 04:28:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:56.630 --> 04:28:56.640 align:start position:0%
i don't believe they have um i can
 
04:28:58.309 --> 04:28:58.319 align:start position:0%
definitely take that back to see if
 
04:29:00.790 --> 04:29:00.800 align:start position:0%
there's any legislative proposals being
 
04:29:03.269 --> 04:29:03.279 align:start position:0%
worked on and i apologize i have i'm
 
04:29:05.110 --> 04:29:05.120 align:start position:0%
looking at the bill on my screen so i
 
04:29:08.229 --> 04:29:08.239 align:start position:0%
don't have the lined version
 
04:29:11.830 --> 04:29:11.840 align:start position:0%
mr chairman to follow up for me
 
04:29:14.149 --> 04:29:14.159 align:start position:0%
is there going to be an interim report
 
04:29:15.750 --> 04:29:15.760 align:start position:0%
coming out before the final one that we
 
04:29:17.110 --> 04:29:17.120 align:start position:0%
can look at
 
04:29:21.030 --> 04:29:21.040 align:start position:0%
to see how it lines up with the bill
 
04:29:23.030 --> 04:29:23.040 align:start position:0%
therefore we could look at potential
 
04:29:24.950 --> 04:29:24.960 align:start position:0%
legislation or possibly even modifying
 
04:29:26.710 --> 04:29:26.720 align:start position:0%
the bill so we can sort of
 
04:29:30.229 --> 04:29:30.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:31.750 --> 04:29:31.760 align:start position:0%
i do not know there isn't going to be an
 
04:29:33.269 --> 04:29:33.279 align:start position:0%
interim but i can definitely take take
 
04:29:35.269 --> 04:29:35.279 align:start position:0%
that question back
 
04:29:37.990 --> 04:29:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:38.000 --> 04:29:40.550 align:start position:0%
 
representative

04:29:40.550 --> 04:29:40.560 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:29:43.189 --> 04:29:43.199 align:start position:0%
thank you very much um given that the
 
04:29:44.950 --> 04:29:44.960 align:start position:0%
council on housing stability you said
 
04:29:46.389 --> 04:29:46.399 align:start position:0%
was created by executive order in
 
04:29:48.149 --> 04:29:48.159 align:start position:0%
november 2020.
 
04:29:50.550 --> 04:29:50.560 align:start position:0%
i am curious whether it is dealing
 
04:29:52.870 --> 04:29:52.880 align:start position:0%
primarily with housing stability
 
04:29:55.510 --> 04:29:55.520 align:start position:0%
questions related to covid
 
04:29:57.429 --> 04:29:57.439 align:start position:0%
or long term because this has certainly
 
04:30:00.630 --> 04:30:00.640 align:start position:0%
been a problem for many years
 
04:30:03.110 --> 04:30:03.120 align:start position:0%
not just with regard to covet and so i'm
 
04:30:04.710 --> 04:30:04.720 align:start position:0%
looking at the charge because the charge
 
04:30:07.110 --> 04:30:07.120 align:start position:0%
of this is a broad charge
 
04:30:08.149 --> 04:30:08.159 align:start position:0%
that is
 
04:30:10.630 --> 04:30:10.640 align:start position:0%
beyond the scope of covid so was the
 
04:30:12.790 --> 04:30:12.800 align:start position:0%
scope of that more to deal with the
 
04:30:19.429 --> 04:30:19.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:21.269 --> 04:30:21.279 align:start position:0%
the council definitely is looking at
 
04:30:23.269 --> 04:30:23.279 align:start position:0%
covet that is um you know that is
 
04:30:24.630 --> 04:30:24.640 align:start position:0%
definitely something that they are
 
04:30:27.830 --> 04:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:30.229 --> 04:30:30.239 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
04:30:32.710 --> 04:30:32.720 align:start position:0%
but i mean are they also though looking
 
04:30:35.030 --> 04:30:35.040 align:start position:0%
at the big picture that existed
 
04:30:37.670 --> 04:30:37.680 align:start position:0%
pre-coveted and not
 
04:30:40.389 --> 04:30:40.399 align:start position:0%
focusing more on covid because this bill
 
04:30:41.910 --> 04:30:41.920 align:start position:0%
is the big picture i believe it's the
 
04:30:44.469 --> 04:30:44.479 align:start position:0%
meeting it's looking at all issues um in
 
04:30:46.950 --> 04:30:46.960 align:start position:0%
addition to covet um i'm looking at
 
04:30:49.429 --> 04:30:49.439 align:start position:0%
their initial report and action plan
 
04:30:52.710 --> 04:30:52.720 align:start position:0%
that's dated december 14th 2020 and it
 
04:30:54.469 --> 04:30:54.479 align:start position:0%
you know there's an introduction
 
04:30:56.469 --> 04:30:56.479 align:start position:0%
it looks at homelessness and housing and
 
04:30:58.950 --> 04:30:58.960 align:start position:0%
security in new hampshire on page one
 
04:31:01.030 --> 04:31:01.040 align:start position:0%
and then i think on page
 
04:31:02.790 --> 04:31:02.800 align:start position:0%
seven of 13
 
04:31:05.030 --> 04:31:05.040 align:start position:0%
romans 7 it looks at the impact of the
 
04:31:07.910 --> 04:31:07.920 align:start position:0%
coven 19 pandemic so i would say that
 
04:31:09.990 --> 04:31:10.000 align:start position:0%
it's looking at a variety of things not
 
04:31:13.830 --> 04:31:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:16.149 --> 04:31:16.159 align:start position:0%
with the information of the committee i
 
04:31:18.389 --> 04:31:18.399 align:start position:0%
just received a text from house
 
04:31:21.030 --> 04:31:21.040 align:start position:0%
committee services saying that they will
 
04:31:24.469 --> 04:31:24.479 align:start position:0%
provide for us the side by side between
 
04:31:27.429 --> 04:31:27.439 align:start position:0%
the tasks that this bill would establish
 
04:31:29.910 --> 04:31:29.920 align:start position:0%
and the tasks in the council we've just
 
04:31:31.429 --> 04:31:31.439 align:start position:0%
been speaking of so we'll know that
 
04:31:33.510 --> 04:31:33.520 align:start position:0%
answer pretty soon
 
04:31:35.710 --> 04:31:35.720 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes
 
04:31:39.510 --> 04:31:39.520 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro
 
04:31:42.710 --> 04:31:42.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
04:31:44.950 --> 04:31:44.960 align:start position:0%
miss lynch for taking my question
 
04:31:44.960 --> 04:31:46.870 align:start position:0%
miss lynch for taking my question
um

04:31:46.870 --> 04:31:46.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:31:49.510 --> 04:31:49.520 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that when you listed some
 
04:31:52.950 --> 04:31:52.960 align:start position:0%
of the representatives on the council
 
04:31:55.990 --> 04:31:56.000 align:start position:0%
that perhaps and
 
04:31:58.149 --> 04:31:58.159 align:start position:0%
i might be wrong but perhaps that they
 
04:31:59.910 --> 04:31:59.920 align:start position:0%
they represented
 
04:32:02.630 --> 04:32:02.640 align:start position:0%
um they tended to represent more state
 
04:32:02.640 --> 04:32:04.149 align:start position:0%
um they tended to represent more state
agencies

04:32:04.149 --> 04:32:04.159 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
04:32:04.159 --> 04:32:05.510 align:start position:0%
agencies
and

04:32:05.510 --> 04:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:32:09.750 --> 04:32:09.760 align:start position:0%
bureaucratic agencies dealing with um
 
04:32:12.149 --> 04:32:12.159 align:start position:0%
housing instability whereas this
 
04:32:14.309 --> 04:32:14.319 align:start position:0%
commission that's being proposed seems
 
04:32:17.269 --> 04:32:17.279 align:start position:0%
to be more represented by organizations
 
04:32:19.269 --> 04:32:19.279 align:start position:0%
that are out on the street working with
 
04:32:21.429 --> 04:32:21.439 align:start position:0%
homeless people that might be an
 
04:32:21.439 --> 04:32:24.229 align:start position:0%
homeless people that might be an
oversimplification

04:32:24.229 --> 04:32:24.239 align:start position:0%
oversimplification
 
04:32:26.630 --> 04:32:26.640 align:start position:0%
but for example
 
04:32:29.750 --> 04:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
um you talked about the bureau of um
 
04:32:31.510 --> 04:32:31.520 align:start position:0%
behavioral health
 
04:32:32.830 --> 04:32:32.840 align:start position:0%
whereas this
 
04:32:36.469 --> 04:32:36.479 align:start position:0%
um new proposed commission would have
 
04:32:38.070 --> 04:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
representatives of the mental health
 
04:32:38.080 --> 04:32:39.189 align:start position:0%
representatives of the mental health
centers

04:32:39.189 --> 04:32:39.199 align:start position:0%
centers
 
04:32:42.630 --> 04:32:42.640 align:start position:0%
who i know at least in my area have a
 
04:32:42.640 --> 04:32:44.149 align:start position:0%
who i know at least in my area have a
um

04:32:44.149 --> 04:32:44.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:32:45.830 --> 04:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
somebody who works specifically with
 
04:32:48.870 --> 04:32:48.880 align:start position:0%
homelessness in the monadnock area
 
04:32:52.149 --> 04:32:52.159 align:start position:0%
so my question is if these um this
 
04:32:54.149 --> 04:32:54.159 align:start position:0%
council and this commission really are
 
04:32:56.070 --> 04:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
duplicative which sounds like it might
 
04:32:57.269 --> 04:32:57.279 align:start position:0%
be the case
 
04:32:59.269 --> 04:32:59.279 align:start position:0%
would there be the possibility of the
 
04:33:02.710 --> 04:33:02.720 align:start position:0%
council absorbing some of the
 
04:33:04.789 --> 04:33:04.799 align:start position:0%
organizations or representatives from
 
04:33:06.869 --> 04:33:06.879 align:start position:0%
some of the organizations from this
 
04:33:09.269 --> 04:33:09.279 align:start position:0%
proposed commission
 
04:33:11.510 --> 04:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
on to the council that's already
 
04:33:11.520 --> 04:33:14.070 align:start position:0%
on to the council that's already
functioning

04:33:14.070 --> 04:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
functioning
 
04:33:17.189 --> 04:33:17.199 align:start position:0%
i think that's a great question um i i
 
04:33:19.269 --> 04:33:19.279 align:start position:0%
can definitely take that back i mean i i
 
04:33:20.470 --> 04:33:20.480 align:start position:0%
might um
 
04:33:23.510 --> 04:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
respectfully disagree um that you know
 
04:33:26.230 --> 04:33:26.240 align:start position:0%
the council it does seem to focus very
 
04:33:28.390 --> 04:33:28.400 align:start position:0%
heavily on state agencies but i would
 
04:33:30.869 --> 04:33:30.879 align:start position:0%
say that it does have you know
 
04:33:33.189 --> 04:33:33.199 align:start position:0%
community members new hampshire catholic
 
04:33:35.910 --> 04:33:35.920 align:start position:0%
charities various police departments so
 
04:33:38.390 --> 04:33:38.400 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't say that it's you know it is
 
04:33:40.150 --> 04:33:40.160 align:start position:0%
a little bit more state more state
 
04:33:42.230 --> 04:33:42.240 align:start position:0%
agency there are a lot of state agencies
 
04:33:44.551 --> 04:33:44.561 align:start position:0%
represented but i think that's a great
 
04:33:46.551 --> 04:33:46.561 align:start position:0%
point to further investigate about
 
04:33:48.629 --> 04:33:48.639 align:start position:0%
whether members could be added to the
 
04:33:51.429 --> 04:33:51.439 align:start position:0%
current council
 
04:33:51.439 --> 04:33:53.830 align:start position:0%
current council
follow-up

04:33:53.830 --> 04:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
04:33:55.629 --> 04:33:55.639 align:start position:0%
i do want to apologize if i was
 
04:34:00.470 --> 04:34:00.480 align:start position:0%
oversimplifying but um perhaps this um
 
04:34:03.269 --> 04:34:03.279 align:start position:0%
if there is any truth to what what i um
 
04:34:05.109 --> 04:34:05.119 align:start position:0%
seem what i thought
 
04:34:06.869 --> 04:34:06.879 align:start position:0%
maybe this would enrich the efforts of
 
04:34:12.070 --> 04:34:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:14.150 --> 04:34:14.160 align:start position:0%
representative marsh
 
04:34:16.230 --> 04:34:16.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you ms
 
04:34:18.949 --> 04:34:18.959 align:start position:0%
lynch for taking my question but given
 
04:34:21.029 --> 04:34:21.039 align:start position:0%
that you feel that this uh commission
 
04:34:23.029 --> 04:34:23.039 align:start position:0%
that's proposed would be duplicative of
 
04:34:25.029 --> 04:34:25.039 align:start position:0%
the one established by executive order
 
04:34:26.470 --> 04:34:26.480 align:start position:0%
number 22.
 
04:34:28.551 --> 04:34:28.561 align:start position:0%
and given that we all anticipate that
 
04:34:30.230 --> 04:34:30.240 align:start position:0%
the state of emergency will at some
 
04:34:31.990 --> 04:34:32.000 align:start position:0%
point be lifted
 
04:34:33.830 --> 04:34:33.840 align:start position:0%
do you not think it might be true for
 
04:34:36.150 --> 04:34:36.160 align:start position:0%
this committee to invent this bill to
 
04:34:37.990 --> 04:34:38.000 align:start position:0%
continue the council for housing
 
04:34:40.709 --> 04:34:40.719 align:start position:0%
stability and statute and perhaps add
 
04:34:42.629 --> 04:34:42.639 align:start position:0%
some members as has been suggested by
 
04:34:42.639 --> 04:34:46.629 align:start position:0%
some members as has been suggested by
representatives

04:34:46.629 --> 04:34:46.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:48.949 --> 04:34:48.959 align:start position:0%
um you know i i would of course you know
 
04:34:50.230 --> 04:34:50.240 align:start position:0%
for an official position with the
 
04:34:51.750 --> 04:34:51.760 align:start position:0%
department i'd have to take it back but
 
04:34:54.551 --> 04:34:54.561 align:start position:0%
to me that makes great sense thank you
 
04:34:57.590 --> 04:34:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:59.109 --> 04:34:59.119 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
04:35:03.830 --> 04:35:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:15.910 --> 04:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:18.551 --> 04:35:18.561 align:start position:0%
okay i'm sorry thank you mr chairman i
 
04:35:20.869 --> 04:35:20.879 align:start position:0%
think i'm being heard now
 
04:35:23.109 --> 04:35:23.119 align:start position:0%
is that right yes thank you
 
04:35:25.269 --> 04:35:25.279 align:start position:0%
i just had a couple of questions perhaps
 
04:35:26.551 --> 04:35:26.561 align:start position:0%
it could be partly answered by
 
04:35:28.470 --> 04:35:28.480 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro
 
04:35:31.109 --> 04:35:31.119 align:start position:0%
uh but i the question there's three
 
04:35:33.269 --> 04:35:33.279 align:start position:0%
additional members who added to the list
 
04:35:35.189 --> 04:35:35.199 align:start position:0%
that was on here and although they
 
04:35:36.551 --> 04:35:36.561 align:start position:0%
mentioned that there were three more to
 
04:35:38.551 --> 04:35:38.561 align:start position:0%
make it 21 i don't know who those other
 
04:35:41.109 --> 04:35:41.119 align:start position:0%
three are so if somebody could say that
 
04:35:43.349 --> 04:35:43.359 align:start position:0%
and the second question i had which i
 
04:35:45.189 --> 04:35:45.199 align:start position:0%
hope could be answered is is
 
04:35:47.590 --> 04:35:47.600 align:start position:0%
representative long still on and if he
 
04:35:47.600 --> 04:35:48.949 align:start position:0%
representative long still on and if he
is

04:35:48.949 --> 04:35:48.959 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:35:51.189 --> 04:35:51.199 align:start position:0%
what's his impression about how the
 
04:35:54.070 --> 04:35:54.080 align:start position:0%
mixture of these two efforts would work
 
04:36:02.709 --> 04:36:02.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:04.789 --> 04:36:04.799 align:start position:0%
representative long's invited to speak
 
04:36:07.910 --> 04:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
if he's still with us there he is hey
 
04:36:09.750 --> 04:36:09.760 align:start position:0%
i am thank you mr chairman thank you
 
04:36:12.470 --> 04:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
representative snow for the question um
 
04:36:12.480 --> 04:36:14.150 align:start position:0%
representative snow for the question um
i

04:36:14.150 --> 04:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:36:16.629 --> 04:36:16.639 align:start position:0%
i still firmly believe that the
 
04:36:19.670 --> 04:36:19.680 align:start position:0%
commission established in 503 are on the
 
04:36:22.629 --> 04:36:22.639 align:start position:0%
grounds people that have the expertise
 
04:36:25.189 --> 04:36:25.199 align:start position:0%
and what needs to be done and i think
 
04:36:27.510 --> 04:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
the best interest of the state
 
04:36:27.520 --> 04:36:28.551 align:start position:0%
the best interest of the state
uh

04:36:28.551 --> 04:36:28.561 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:36:28.561 --> 04:36:29.269 align:start position:0%

to
 
04:36:31.510 --> 04:36:31.520 align:start position:0%
to affect this
 
04:36:33.269 --> 04:36:33.279 align:start position:0%
addressing of homelessness would be
 
04:36:35.269 --> 04:36:35.279 align:start position:0%
through a commission and not housing
 
04:36:35.279 --> 04:36:37.670 align:start position:0%
through a commission and not housing

an interim report that the council did
 
04:38:07.990 --> 04:38:08.000 align:start position:0%

04:38:10.949 --> 04:38:10.959 align:start position:0%
to add new members and the council does
 
04:38:15.189 --> 04:38:15.199 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chairman and thank you ms
 
04:39:25.109 --> 04:39:25.119 align:start position:0%
lynch just to clarify
 
04:39:27.910 --> 04:39:27.920 align:start position:0%
am i correct and i'm very sorry if this
 
04:39:29.830 --> 04:39:29.840 align:start position:0%
is duplicative and if it is just tell me
 
04:39:31.750 --> 04:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
so and i'll find out from somebody else
 
04:39:34.390 --> 04:39:34.400 align:start position:0%
but i had to step away from a minute
 
04:39:36.789 --> 04:39:36.799 align:start position:0%
am i correct in thinking that this bill
 
04:39:40.150 --> 04:39:40.160 align:start position:0%
was created under an emergency order and
 
04:39:41.670 --> 04:39:41.680 align:start position:0%
if so
 
04:39:44.868 --> 04:39:44.878 align:start position:0%
it the council created by emergency
 
04:39:44.878 --> 04:39:46.070 align:start position:0%
it the council created by emergency
order

04:39:46.070 --> 04:39:46.080 align:start position:0%
order
 
04:39:48.390 --> 04:39:48.400 align:start position:0%
will vanish when the state
 
04:39:51.030 --> 04:39:51.040 align:start position:0%
of the emergency is over and the order
 
04:39:53.190 --> 04:39:53.200 align:start position:0%
terminates is that correct
 
04:39:55.670 --> 04:39:55.680 align:start position:0%
i understand that the the governor could
 
04:39:55.680 --> 04:39:56.470 align:start position:0%
i understand that the the governor could
then

04:39:56.470 --> 04:39:56.480 align:start position:0%
then
 
04:39:58.470 --> 04:39:58.480 align:start position:0%
issue an executive order
 
04:39:58.480 --> 04:40:01.270 align:start position:0%
issue an executive order
um

04:40:01.270 --> 04:40:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:03.510 --> 04:40:03.520 align:start position:0%
having any other council he wants but
 
04:40:05.670 --> 04:40:05.680 align:start position:0%
but this specific one
 
04:40:07.830 --> 04:40:07.840 align:start position:0%
would not necessarily continue is that
 
04:40:07.840 --> 04:40:09.190 align:start position:0%
would not necessarily continue is that
correct

04:40:09.190 --> 04:40:09.200 align:start position:0%
correct
 
04:40:10.948 --> 04:40:10.958 align:start position:0%
um there is my understanding is that
 
04:40:13.830 --> 04:40:13.840 align:start position:0%
there's no ending and i'm looking at the
 
04:40:13.840 --> 04:40:14.830 align:start position:0%
there's no ending and i'm looking at the
um

04:40:14.830 --> 04:40:14.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:40:17.590 --> 04:40:17.600 align:start position:0%
executive order that created the council
 
04:40:19.910 --> 04:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
which is 20 20 22
 
04:40:22.070 --> 04:40:22.080 align:start position:0%
well 2020-22
 
04:40:23.670 --> 04:40:23.680 align:start position:0%
and i don't believe it was created
 
04:40:27.270 --> 04:40:27.280 align:start position:0%
pursuant to the emergency order um
 
04:40:29.190 --> 04:40:29.200 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for the clarification
 
04:40:32.550 --> 04:40:32.560 align:start position:0%

04:40:37.750 --> 04:40:37.760 align:start position:0%

so we
 
04:47:13.110 --> 04:47:13.120 align:start position:0%
we changed some language from the
 
04:47:14.470 --> 04:47:14.480 align:start position:0%
original bill
 
04:47:16.708 --> 04:47:16.718 align:start position:0%
where it said cdc
 
04:47:20.150 --> 04:47:20.160 align:start position:0%
uh recommended vaccines in the
 
04:47:23.270 --> 04:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
first paragraph of the bill
 
04:47:23.280 --> 04:47:24.550 align:start position:0%
first paragraph of the bill
to

04:47:24.550 --> 04:47:24.560 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:47:24.560 --> 04:47:25.590 align:start position:0%
to
list

04:47:25.590 --> 04:47:25.600 align:start position:0%
list
 
04:47:27.030 --> 04:47:27.040 align:start position:0%
the current
 
04:47:27.040 --> 04:47:28.230 align:start position:0%
the current
adult

04:47:28.230 --> 04:47:28.240 align:start position:0%
adult
 
04:47:28.240 --> 04:47:29.430 align:start position:0%
adult
schedules

04:47:29.430 --> 04:47:29.440 align:start position:0%
schedules
 
04:47:31.910 --> 04:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
recommended vaccines
 
04:47:34.708 --> 04:47:34.718 align:start position:0%
um specifically each one
 
04:47:38.230 --> 04:47:38.240 align:start position:0%
um in doing so if any more are added to
 
04:47:39.910 --> 04:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
the cdc
 
04:47:41.590 --> 04:47:41.600 align:start position:0%
recommended schedule
 
04:47:43.510 --> 04:47:43.520 align:start position:0%
they will have to have legislative
 
04:47:45.190 --> 04:47:45.200 align:start position:0%
approval first
 
04:47:48.708 --> 04:47:48.718 align:start position:0%
we also clarified the language
 
04:47:51.110 --> 04:47:51.120 align:start position:0%
there was some confusion over
 
04:47:53.830 --> 04:47:53.840 align:start position:0%
whether pharmacists
 
04:47:55.990 --> 04:47:56.000 align:start position:0%
could administer vaccines to individuals
 
04:47:59.270 --> 04:47:59.280 align:start position:0%
of 18 years or older and we clarified
 
04:48:02.470 --> 04:48:02.480 align:start position:0%
that uh or under and we clarified that
 
04:48:02.480 --> 04:48:03.350 align:start position:0%
that uh or under and we clarified that
to

04:48:03.350 --> 04:48:03.360 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:48:06.470 --> 04:48:06.480 align:start position:0%
say yes it's it's only two adults 18
 
04:48:09.750 --> 04:48:09.760 align:start position:0%
years of age or older online
 
04:48:13.270 --> 04:48:13.280 align:start position:0%
we also added
 
04:48:15.510 --> 04:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
that the vaccines must be approved by
 
04:48:15.520 --> 04:48:16.310 align:start position:0%
that the vaccines must be approved by
the

04:48:16.310 --> 04:48:16.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:48:18.708 --> 04:48:18.718 align:start position:0%
food and drug administration
 
04:48:20.550 --> 04:48:20.560 align:start position:0%
the amendment that's here that you may
 
04:48:21.910 --> 04:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
have says federal and drug
 
04:48:23.990 --> 04:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
administration that was a
 
04:48:24.000 --> 04:48:25.110 align:start position:0%
administration that was a
typo

04:48:25.110 --> 04:48:25.120 align:start position:0%
typo
 
04:48:27.910 --> 04:48:27.920 align:start position:0%
but we have emailed you all a copy of
 
04:48:29.750 --> 04:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
the latest version
 
04:48:32.390 --> 04:48:32.400 align:start position:0%
of the amendment where that is
 
04:48:34.310 --> 04:48:34.320 align:start position:0%
fixed and says food and drug
 
04:48:34.320 --> 04:48:36.868 align:start position:0%
fixed and says food and drug
administration

04:48:36.868 --> 04:48:36.878 align:start position:0%
administration
 
04:48:36.878 --> 04:48:40.310 align:start position:0%
administration
the

04:48:40.310 --> 04:48:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:42.868 --> 04:48:42.878 align:start position:0%
paragraph three has
 
04:48:46.230 --> 04:48:46.240 align:start position:0%
just been changed to clarify that
 
04:48:46.240 --> 04:48:47.110 align:start position:0%
just been changed to clarify that
um

04:48:47.110 --> 04:48:47.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:48:50.310 --> 04:48:50.320 align:start position:0%
every vaccine that's administered the
 
04:48:52.390 --> 04:48:52.400 align:start position:0%
pharmacist pharmacy intern or licensed
 
04:48:56.390 --> 04:48:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:57.990 --> 04:48:58.000 align:start position:0%
computer training specific to
 
04:48:59.830 --> 04:48:59.840 align:start position:0%
administration of their respective
 
04:48:59.840 --> 04:49:02.390 align:start position:0%
administration of their respective
vaccines

04:49:02.390 --> 04:49:02.400 align:start position:0%
vaccines
 
04:49:04.708 --> 04:49:04.718 align:start position:0%
instead of just the specific ones that
 
04:49:09.990 --> 04:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:12.470 --> 04:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
and then
 
04:49:15.110 --> 04:49:15.120 align:start position:0%
you'll see roman numeral d
 
04:49:15.120 --> 04:49:16.230 align:start position:0%
you'll see roman numeral d
says

04:49:16.230 --> 04:49:16.240 align:start position:0%
says
 
04:49:18.708 --> 04:49:18.718 align:start position:0%
uh provide notice to the primary care
 
04:49:21.590 --> 04:49:21.600 align:start position:0%
provider when when one is designated by
 
04:49:23.910 --> 04:49:23.920 align:start position:0%
the patient of the administration of any
 
04:49:23.920 --> 04:49:25.270 align:start position:0%
the patient of the administration of any
vaccine

04:49:25.270 --> 04:49:25.280 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
04:49:29.510 --> 04:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:32.390 --> 04:49:32.400 align:start position:0%
the physicians are aware of
 
04:49:33.510 --> 04:49:33.520 align:start position:0%
what their
 
04:49:35.270 --> 04:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
patients have
 
04:49:37.030 --> 04:49:37.040 align:start position:0%
received as
 
04:49:38.948 --> 04:49:38.958 align:start position:0%
medical interventions outside of their
 
04:49:38.958 --> 04:49:41.670 align:start position:0%
medical interventions outside of their
office

04:49:41.670 --> 04:49:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:43.830 --> 04:49:43.840 align:start position:0%
and then we just clarified the language
 
04:49:43.840 --> 04:49:44.868 align:start position:0%
and then we just clarified the language
in

04:49:44.868 --> 04:49:44.878 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:49:44.878 --> 04:49:46.708 align:start position:0%
in
numeral

04:49:46.708 --> 04:49:46.718 align:start position:0%
numeral
 
04:49:46.718 --> 04:49:48.550 align:start position:0%
numeral
six

04:49:48.550 --> 04:49:48.560 align:start position:0%
six
 
04:49:50.948 --> 04:49:50.958 align:start position:0%
to say report the vaccination in the
 
04:49:53.270 --> 04:49:53.280 align:start position:0%
state vaccine registry
 
04:49:55.590 --> 04:49:55.600 align:start position:0%
with patient consent
 
04:49:59.030 --> 04:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
or when required by state federal law
 
04:50:01.430 --> 04:50:01.440 align:start position:0%
this allows some flexibility uh pending
 
04:50:16.830 --> 04:50:16.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:19.670 --> 04:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
and lastly
 
04:50:22.628 --> 04:50:22.638 align:start position:0%
section the last section that was added
 
04:50:26.310 --> 04:50:26.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:26.320 --> 04:50:27.430 align:start position:0%
 
vii

04:50:27.430 --> 04:50:27.440 align:start position:0%
vii
 
04:50:28.948 --> 04:50:28.958 align:start position:0%
7 says
 
04:50:31.430 --> 04:50:31.440 align:start position:0%
submit reports of any adverse reactions
 
04:50:34.070 --> 04:50:34.080 align:start position:0%
following vaccination to the cdc vaccine
 
04:50:36.150 --> 04:50:36.160 align:start position:0%
adverse event reporting system
 
04:50:38.230 --> 04:50:38.240 align:start position:0%
within three days of being made aware of
 
04:50:41.030 --> 04:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
such adverse effects occurring
 
04:50:44.150 --> 04:50:44.160 align:start position:0%
this is already required by federal law
 
04:50:46.070 --> 04:50:46.080 align:start position:0%
but this just clarifies and puts it in
 
04:50:48.550 --> 04:50:48.560 align:start position:0%
statute for pharmacists pharmacy
 
04:50:50.310 --> 04:50:50.320 align:start position:0%
uh advanced
 
04:50:52.230 --> 04:50:52.240 align:start position:0%
licensed advanced pharmacy technicians
 
04:50:55.990 --> 04:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
and pharmacy interns to be aware of it
 
04:50:57.910 --> 04:50:57.920 align:start position:0%
that's all and i think that we have a
 
04:51:05.350 --> 04:51:05.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:08.868 --> 04:51:08.878 align:start position:0%
the chair would like to know is
 
04:51:11.910 --> 04:51:11.920 align:start position:0%
legislative services going to
 
04:51:12.830 --> 04:51:12.840 align:start position:0%
give us
 
04:51:15.510 --> 04:51:15.520 align:start position:0%
another typed out amendment
 
04:51:18.628 --> 04:51:18.638 align:start position:0%
with another amendment number
 
04:51:21.510 --> 04:51:21.520 align:start position:0%
uh yes mr chairman ols has already done
 
04:51:23.830 --> 04:51:23.840 align:start position:0%
that it's on the screen right now and
 
04:51:25.270 --> 04:51:25.280 align:start position:0%
the amendment which i believe
 
04:51:27.510 --> 04:51:27.520 align:start position:0%
representative cushman intended to move
 
04:51:31.670 --> 04:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:34.628 --> 04:51:34.638 align:start position:0%
and that is the same as 467h with the
 
04:51:37.430 --> 04:51:37.440 align:start position:0%
exception of that word change in line
 
04:51:37.440 --> 04:51:38.470 align:start position:0%
exception of that word change in line
10.

04:51:38.470 --> 04:51:38.480 align:start position:0%
10.
 
04:51:41.110 --> 04:51:41.120 align:start position:0%
there's a single word on line 10 where
 
04:51:43.350 --> 04:51:43.360 align:start position:0%
word federal has been replaced with the
 
04:51:46.150 --> 04:51:46.160 align:start position:0%
word food because there was a
 
04:51:52.150 --> 04:51:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:53.670 --> 04:51:53.680 align:start position:0%
would you like to
 
04:51:56.868 --> 04:51:56.878 align:start position:0%
remove the amendment i i would like to
 
04:51:59.190 --> 04:51:59.200 align:start position:0%
move that amendment can you tell me the
 
04:52:02.070 --> 04:52:02.080 align:start position:0%
number again zero five seven six h and
 
04:52:04.470 --> 04:52:04.480 align:start position:0%
representative marshall ii
 
04:52:06.948 --> 04:52:06.958 align:start position:0%
okay cushman moves
 
04:52:09.430 --> 04:52:09.440 align:start position:0%
march seconds
 
04:52:15.670 --> 04:52:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:17.990 --> 04:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
representative wood
 
04:52:19.910 --> 04:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair and uh thank you
 
04:52:21.830 --> 04:52:21.840 align:start position:0%
representative uh excuse me christian
 
04:52:24.868 --> 04:52:24.878 align:start position:0%
for taking my questions uh i
 
04:52:26.628 --> 04:52:26.638 align:start position:0%
i must have been on my
 
04:52:28.390 --> 04:52:28.400 align:start position:0%
probably my end here but it broke up
 
04:52:29.670 --> 04:52:29.680 align:start position:0%
just a little bit
 
04:52:32.390 --> 04:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
uh relative to sections five
 
04:52:34.708 --> 04:52:34.718 align:start position:0%
and section six
 
04:52:37.590 --> 04:52:37.600 align:start position:0%
and if you could just uh clarify
 
04:52:39.590 --> 04:52:39.600 align:start position:0%
i see that the notice goes to the
 
04:52:42.390 --> 04:52:42.400 align:start position:0%
primary care provider
 
04:52:44.390 --> 04:52:44.400 align:start position:0%
buried in this is that if they don't
 
04:52:46.310 --> 04:52:46.320 align:start position:0%
have a primary care
 
04:52:48.070 --> 04:52:48.080 align:start position:0%
do they get a card
 
04:52:52.230 --> 04:52:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:54.788 --> 04:52:54.798 align:start position:0%
uh i think that representative merchant
 
04:52:57.030 --> 04:52:57.040 align:start position:0%
may be able to answer that better i
 
04:52:58.868 --> 04:52:58.878 align:start position:0%
believe it's already required by law
 
04:52:58.878 --> 04:52:59.830 align:start position:0%
believe it's already required by law
that

04:52:59.830 --> 04:52:59.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:53:03.110 --> 04:53:03.120 align:start position:0%
uh you have to give a record of the
 
04:53:04.948 --> 04:53:04.958 align:start position:0%
immunization to
 
04:53:07.350 --> 04:53:07.360 align:start position:0%
someone who receives one but i thought
 
04:53:09.590 --> 04:53:09.600 align:start position:0%
that was the case but i didn't see it so
 
04:53:11.270 --> 04:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
i thought maybe i didn't want to make a
 
04:53:13.510 --> 04:53:13.520 align:start position:0%
false assumption
 
04:53:14.788 --> 04:53:14.798 align:start position:0%
thank you representative woodson thank
 
04:53:16.708 --> 04:53:16.718 align:start position:0%
you represent cushman um when a patient
 
04:53:18.230 --> 04:53:18.240 align:start position:0%
gets a vaccine regardless of where they
 
04:53:20.470 --> 04:53:20.480 align:start position:0%
get the vaccine they're required to be
 
04:53:20.480 --> 04:53:21.510 align:start position:0%
get the vaccine they're required to be
given

04:53:21.510 --> 04:53:21.520 align:start position:0%
given
 
04:53:23.510 --> 04:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
to them as a
 
04:53:26.230 --> 04:53:26.240 align:start position:0%
by the cdc is a vaccine
 
04:53:28.070 --> 04:53:28.080 align:start position:0%
report about the vaccine itself side
 
04:53:29.670 --> 04:53:29.680 align:start position:0%
effects and so forth etc so that's given
 
04:53:33.350 --> 04:53:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:36.310 --> 04:53:36.320 align:start position:0%
and if i may um the language we have
 
04:53:36.320 --> 04:53:37.670 align:start position:0%
and if i may um the language we have
here

04:53:37.670 --> 04:53:37.680 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:53:39.350 --> 04:53:39.360 align:start position:0%
currently in statute
 
04:53:43.030 --> 04:53:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:45.670 --> 04:53:45.680 align:start position:0%
follow mr chair follow up
 
04:53:48.788 --> 04:53:48.798 align:start position:0%
um yeah thank you um in the next section
 
04:53:50.390 --> 04:53:50.400 align:start position:0%
on section six
 
04:53:52.550 --> 04:53:52.560 align:start position:0%
uh could you clarify exactly how that
 
04:53:54.948 --> 04:53:54.958 align:start position:0%
would work recording the vaccination
 
04:53:57.510 --> 04:53:57.520 align:start position:0%
state uh vaccine registry uh broke up
 
04:53:58.948 --> 04:53:58.958 align:start position:0%
there and i wasn't
 
04:54:00.550 --> 04:54:00.560 align:start position:0%
so if you could run that for me again
 
04:54:00.560 --> 04:54:02.550 align:start position:0%
so if you could run that for me again
please

04:54:02.550 --> 04:54:02.560 align:start position:0%
please
 
04:54:02.560 --> 04:54:03.750 align:start position:0%
please
um

04:54:03.750 --> 04:54:03.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:54:05.750 --> 04:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
yes grab some coachman you like me to
 
04:54:06.788 --> 04:54:06.798 align:start position:0%
address that or do you want to address
 
04:54:09.110 --> 04:54:09.120 align:start position:0%
it you can you can take it if you like
 
04:54:09.990 --> 04:54:10.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:54:13.350 --> 04:54:13.360 align:start position:0%
so basically we have another bill before
 
04:54:15.590 --> 04:54:15.600 align:start position:0%
the legislative body and that's house
 
04:54:17.590 --> 04:54:17.600 align:start position:0%
bill 2-2-1
 
04:54:19.990 --> 04:54:20.000 align:start position:0%
which is an opt-in or opt-out so the way
 
04:54:20.000 --> 04:54:20.868 align:start position:0%
which is an opt-in or opt-out so the way
i

04:54:20.868 --> 04:54:20.878 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:54:22.470 --> 04:54:22.480 align:start position:0%
way representative cushman and i wrote
 
04:54:22.480 --> 04:54:23.270 align:start position:0%
way representative cushman and i wrote
this

04:54:23.270 --> 04:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:54:26.868 --> 04:54:26.878 align:start position:0%
was that if it's an opt-out
 
04:54:26.878 --> 04:54:27.590 align:start position:0%
was that if it's an opt-out
then

04:54:27.590 --> 04:54:27.600 align:start position:0%
then
 
04:54:29.430 --> 04:54:29.440 align:start position:0%
the pharmacist has to comply with the
 
04:54:32.390 --> 04:54:32.400 align:start position:0%
opt out if it's an opt in barnes has to
 
04:54:33.990 --> 04:54:34.000 align:start position:0%
comply with the opt-in
 
04:54:36.070 --> 04:54:36.080 align:start position:0%
so instead of holding up this bill
 
04:54:38.150 --> 04:54:38.160 align:start position:0%
based upon that bill we wrote in such a
 
04:54:40.628 --> 04:54:40.638 align:start position:0%
way that regardless of which way it goes
 
04:54:42.550 --> 04:54:42.560 align:start position:0%
the pharmacist will be compliant
 
04:54:45.030 --> 04:54:45.040 align:start position:0%
in either direction
 
04:54:47.990 --> 04:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
okay i thank you i just uh right at that
 
04:54:50.150 --> 04:54:50.160 align:start position:0%
crucial point uh the explanation broke
 
04:54:51.510 --> 04:54:51.520 align:start position:0%
up and so
 
04:54:53.430 --> 04:54:53.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:54:55.510 --> 04:54:55.520 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
04:54:57.110 --> 04:54:57.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to be a question could be a
 
04:55:01.830 --> 04:55:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:01.840 --> 04:55:04.310 align:start position:0%
 
representative

04:55:04.310 --> 04:55:04.320 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:55:06.628 --> 04:55:06.638 align:start position:0%
yes thank you um
 
04:55:08.788 --> 04:55:08.798 align:start position:0%
well i appreciate the idea of having the
 
04:55:08.798 --> 04:55:09.830 align:start position:0%
well i appreciate the idea of having the
list

04:55:09.830 --> 04:55:09.840 align:start position:0%
list
 
04:55:13.990 --> 04:55:14.000 align:start position:0%
of vaccinations extracted from the cdc
 
04:55:14.000 --> 04:55:15.510 align:start position:0%
of vaccinations extracted from the cdc
i

04:55:15.510 --> 04:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:55:17.830 --> 04:55:17.840 align:start position:0%
i really wonder why do that rather than
 
04:55:20.788 --> 04:55:20.798 align:start position:0%
just default to the cdc because
 
04:55:22.470 --> 04:55:22.480 align:start position:0%
we often do that we often will have a
 
04:55:24.150 --> 04:55:24.160 align:start position:0%
reference to
 
04:55:26.390 --> 04:55:26.400 align:start position:0%
federal regulations because those can
 
04:55:26.400 --> 04:55:27.350 align:start position:0%
federal regulations because those can
change

04:55:27.350 --> 04:55:27.360 align:start position:0%
change
 
04:55:29.830 --> 04:55:29.840 align:start position:0%
and the difficulty is if we if a
 
04:55:29.840 --> 04:55:30.550 align:start position:0%
and the difficulty is if we if a
if

04:55:30.550 --> 04:55:30.560 align:start position:0%
if
 
04:55:32.550 --> 04:55:32.560 align:start position:0%
something is dropped or if something is
 
04:55:35.270 --> 04:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
added we have a very cumbersome and slow
 
04:55:37.350 --> 04:55:37.360 align:start position:0%
process that may take as long as a year
 
04:55:39.190 --> 04:55:39.200 align:start position:0%
to a year and a half before it can be
 
04:55:41.750 --> 04:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
modified in statute whereas if it's
 
04:55:43.990 --> 04:55:44.000 align:start position:0%
changed in the cdc list
 
04:55:46.150 --> 04:55:46.160 align:start position:0%
it's automatically there and that can go
 
04:55:48.070 --> 04:55:48.080 align:start position:0%
into effect immediately which is why on
 
04:55:51.030 --> 04:55:51.040 align:start position:0%
the other vaccine bill i just defaulted
 
04:55:52.948 --> 04:55:52.958 align:start position:0%
to the cdc list rather than list them
 
04:55:55.270 --> 04:55:55.280 align:start position:0%
all because it will be a fluid thing it
 
04:55:57.030 --> 04:55:57.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't change often but it will be
 
04:55:57.040 --> 04:55:58.070 align:start position:0%
doesn't change often but it will be
fluid

04:55:58.070 --> 04:55:58.080 align:start position:0%
fluid
 
04:56:00.390 --> 04:56:00.400 align:start position:0%
any reservations about moving back to
 
04:56:01.750 --> 04:56:01.760 align:start position:0%
that i see representative marsh has a
 
04:56:03.270 --> 04:56:03.280 align:start position:0%
hand up maybe he's got a good answer for
 
04:56:06.550 --> 04:56:06.560 align:start position:0%
that well let's ask representative marsh
 
04:56:08.550 --> 04:56:08.560 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for that question uh
 
04:56:08.560 --> 04:56:09.670 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for that question uh
representative

04:56:09.670 --> 04:56:09.680 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:56:12.070 --> 04:56:12.080 align:start position:0%
uh i will just say that sometimes this
 
04:56:14.070 --> 04:56:14.080 align:start position:0%
is the way this message is made and this
 
04:56:15.430 --> 04:56:15.440 align:start position:0%
is the way the parties came from
 
04:56:17.910 --> 04:56:17.920 align:start position:0%
agreement and i would love to keep them
 
04:56:20.550 --> 04:56:20.560 align:start position:0%
in agreement so uh that's the answer to
 
04:56:26.470 --> 04:56:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:28.070 --> 04:56:28.080 align:start position:0%
yeah i understand sasha it can be made
 
04:56:29.670 --> 04:56:29.680 align:start position:0%
different ways but i just understand i
 
04:56:31.510 --> 04:56:31.520 align:start position:0%
want to understand the rationale for not
 
04:56:31.520 --> 04:56:32.868 align:start position:0%
want to understand the rationale for not
defaulting

04:56:32.868 --> 04:56:32.878 align:start position:0%
defaulting
 
04:56:35.110 --> 04:56:35.120 align:start position:0%
to it rather than
 
04:56:37.670 --> 04:56:37.680 align:start position:0%
doing an enumeration
 
04:56:39.670 --> 04:56:39.680 align:start position:0%

compromise between myself and

representative cushman um she felt
 
04:56:49.110 --> 04:56:49.120 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable allowing for it to be
 
04:56:52.310 --> 04:56:52.320 align:start position:0%
automatic and in respect to her concerns
 
04:56:54.150 --> 04:56:54.160 align:start position:0%

representative christman
 
04:59:44.628 --> 04:59:44.638 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
04:59:48.470 --> 04:59:48.480 align:start position:0%
i support this bill as amended um in my
 
04:59:50.470 --> 04:59:50.480 align:start position:0%
discussions with representative merchant
 
04:59:52.470 --> 04:59:52.480 align:start position:0%
there were a couple of other issues that
 
04:59:54.868 --> 04:59:54.878 align:start position:0%
i just want to state for the record that
 
04:59:59.030 --> 04:59:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:01.750 --> 05:00:01.760 align:start position:0%
with every vaccine that's given except
 
05:00:04.550 --> 05:00:04.560 align:start position:0%
the coca-19 vaccines
 
05:00:06.788 --> 05:00:06.798 align:start position:0%
there is required
 
05:00:10.310 --> 05:00:10.320 align:start position:0%
to also be given to each patient the
 
05:00:12.788 --> 05:00:12.798 align:start position:0%
vaccine information sheet
 
05:00:12.798 --> 05:00:14.470 align:start position:0%
vaccine information sheet
and

05:00:14.470 --> 05:00:14.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:00:16.628 --> 05:00:16.638 align:start position:0%
because they're not
 
05:00:19.350 --> 05:00:19.360 align:start position:0%
require i i propose that we add the
 
05:00:21.830 --> 05:00:21.840 align:start position:0%
manufacturer fact sheet for recipients
 
05:00:23.590 --> 05:00:23.600 align:start position:0%
and caregivers
 
05:00:27.270 --> 05:00:27.280 align:start position:0%
to be given with the covid19 vaccines
 
05:00:29.350 --> 05:00:29.360 align:start position:0%
however because
 
05:00:32.070 --> 05:00:32.080 align:start position:0%
they're currently not required of
 
05:00:35.350 --> 05:00:35.360 align:start position:0%
other medical providers um
 
05:00:38.390 --> 05:00:38.400 align:start position:0%
it was decided that it would not be um
 
05:00:40.708 --> 05:00:40.718 align:start position:0%
it would be fair to have
 
05:00:43.590 --> 05:00:43.600 align:start position:0%
separate you know double standard for
 
05:00:45.830 --> 05:00:45.840 align:start position:0%
physicians and you know would be kind of
 
05:00:48.310 --> 05:00:48.320 align:start position:0%
confusing for patients
 
05:00:50.150 --> 05:00:50.160 align:start position:0%
for some would get the fact sheet some
 
05:00:50.160 --> 05:00:51.190 align:start position:0%
for some would get the fact sheet some
wouldn't

05:00:51.190 --> 05:00:51.200 align:start position:0%
wouldn't
 
05:00:53.510 --> 05:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
so i'd like to work on that next
 
05:00:53.520 --> 05:00:55.030 align:start position:0%
so i'd like to work on that next
session

05:00:55.030 --> 05:00:55.040 align:start position:0%
session
 
05:00:57.510 --> 05:00:57.520 align:start position:0%
next house session to
 
05:00:57.520 --> 05:00:58.550 align:start position:0%
next house session to
to

05:00:58.550 --> 05:00:58.560 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:01:00.830 --> 05:01:00.840 align:start position:0%
amend the law to make it so those are
 
05:01:04.628 --> 05:01:04.638 align:start position:0%
required and also i
 
05:01:08.788 --> 05:01:08.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:10.948 --> 05:01:10.958 align:start position:0%
instead of approved by the food and drug
 
05:01:10.958 --> 05:01:12.788 align:start position:0%
instead of approved by the food and drug
administration

05:01:12.788 --> 05:01:12.798 align:start position:0%
administration
 
05:01:15.670 --> 05:01:15.680 align:start position:0%
just because the only vaccine on here
 
05:01:17.190 --> 05:01:17.200 align:start position:0%
that is
 
05:01:21.350 --> 05:01:21.360 align:start position:0%
not licensed is the copa 19 vaccine
 
05:01:21.360 --> 05:01:23.670 align:start position:0%
not licensed is the copa 19 vaccine
and

05:01:23.670 --> 05:01:23.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:01:25.990 --> 05:01:26.000 align:start position:0%
if by some chance it starts to become
 
05:01:28.230 --> 05:01:28.240 align:start position:0%
common practice for emergency youth
 
05:01:31.670 --> 05:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
authorities use authorization to be
 
05:01:31.680 --> 05:01:33.110 align:start position:0%
authorities use authorization to be
um

05:01:33.110 --> 05:01:33.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:01:33.120 --> 05:01:35.190 align:start position:0%
um
implemented

05:01:35.190 --> 05:01:35.200 align:start position:0%
implemented
 
05:01:36.470 --> 05:01:36.480 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
05:01:38.788 --> 05:01:38.798 align:start position:0%
rather we have licensed and then if
 
05:01:41.110 --> 05:01:41.120 align:start position:0%
there's a true emergency
 
05:01:42.868 --> 05:01:42.878 align:start position:0%
where a vaccine needs to be dispensed
 
05:01:45.510 --> 05:01:45.520 align:start position:0%
quickly um likely there will be an
 
05:01:49.510 --> 05:01:49.520 align:start position:0%
emergency order to that effect
 
05:01:51.670 --> 05:01:51.680 align:start position:0%
and then the only other thing that i
 
05:01:54.390 --> 05:01:54.400 align:start position:0%
would would have liked to see
 
05:01:56.628 --> 05:01:56.638 align:start position:0%
but again i support the bill as amended
 
05:01:56.638 --> 05:01:58.310 align:start position:0%
but again i support the bill as amended
now

05:01:58.310 --> 05:01:58.320 align:start position:0%
now
 
05:02:00.948 --> 05:02:00.958 align:start position:0%
is i would have liked to see
 
05:02:03.670 --> 05:02:03.680 align:start position:0%
after food and drug administration and
 
05:02:06.788 --> 05:02:06.798 align:start position:0%
as recommended by the cdc
 
05:02:09.190 --> 05:02:09.200 align:start position:0%
adult vaccination schedule
 
05:02:13.670 --> 05:02:13.680 align:start position:0%
the reason for that being that
 
05:02:14.948 --> 05:02:14.958 align:start position:0%
as a
 
05:02:17.270 --> 05:02:17.280 align:start position:0%
as a way to
 
05:02:20.868 --> 05:02:20.878 align:start position:0%
ensure that new hampshire consumers are
 
05:02:22.948 --> 05:02:22.958 align:start position:0%
um protected from
 
05:02:24.868 --> 05:02:24.878 align:start position:0%
kind of just
 
05:02:27.590 --> 05:02:27.600 align:start position:0%
gross sales practices
 
05:02:30.708 --> 05:02:30.718 align:start position:0%
we keep in mind that not every
 
05:02:30.718 --> 05:02:31.910 align:start position:0%
we keep in mind that not every
um

05:02:31.910 --> 05:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:02:34.230 --> 05:02:34.240 align:start position:0%
vaccine is recommended for every
 
05:02:37.190 --> 05:02:37.200 align:start position:0%
adult there are contraindications and i
 
05:02:40.150 --> 05:02:40.160 align:start position:0%
think that pharmacists will make that
 
05:02:42.310 --> 05:02:42.320 align:start position:0%
decision anyway but i just wanted to
 
05:02:44.628 --> 05:02:44.638 align:start position:0%
mention that those i wanted to have in
 
05:02:45.990 --> 05:02:46.000 align:start position:0%
there but we'll work on those another
 
05:02:48.070 --> 05:02:48.080 align:start position:0%
time and i support the bill as written
 
05:02:48.080 --> 05:02:49.270 align:start position:0%
time and i support the bill as written
today

05:02:49.270 --> 05:02:49.280 align:start position:0%
today
 
05:02:52.310 --> 05:02:52.320 align:start position:0%
i see sausage construction in your
 
05:02:52.320 --> 05:02:54.708 align:start position:0%
i see sausage construction in your
future

05:02:54.708 --> 05:02:54.718 align:start position:0%
future
 
05:02:57.590 --> 05:02:57.600 align:start position:0%
yes representative go ahead
 
05:02:59.670 --> 05:02:59.680 align:start position:0%
yes i just want to on the record say
 
05:03:02.390 --> 05:03:02.400 align:start position:0%
that i did speak with
 
05:03:03.910 --> 05:03:03.920 align:start position:0%
representative cushman on this and i'd
 
05:03:05.510 --> 05:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
be willing to work with her on the bill
 
05:03:07.910 --> 05:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
my concern was that we have a uniform
 
05:03:10.788 --> 05:03:10.798 align:start position:0%
standard regardless of the provider um
 
05:03:10.798 --> 05:03:11.830 align:start position:0%
standard regardless of the provider um
so

05:03:11.830 --> 05:03:11.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:03:13.510 --> 05:03:13.520 align:start position:0%
be willing to sit down with her roll up
 
05:03:14.948 --> 05:03:14.958 align:start position:0%
my sleeves and figure out how we can
 
05:03:17.430 --> 05:03:17.440 align:start position:0%
make something that works across all
 
05:03:20.550 --> 05:03:20.560 align:start position:0%
providers and not just roll out a tip of
 
05:03:21.910 --> 05:03:21.920 align:start position:0%
a provider which this bill would have
 
05:03:21.920 --> 05:03:24.310 align:start position:0%
a provider which this bill would have
done

05:03:24.310 --> 05:03:24.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:25.510 --> 05:03:25.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:03:26.948 --> 05:03:26.958 align:start position:0%
representative webber you have your hand
 
05:03:26.958 --> 05:03:28.150 align:start position:0%
representative webber you have your hand
done

05:03:28.150 --> 05:03:28.160 align:start position:0%
done
 
05:03:29.990 --> 05:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i don't know if
 
05:03:32.310 --> 05:03:32.320 align:start position:0%
i'm under a continuing obligation to
 
05:03:34.470 --> 05:03:34.480 align:start position:0%
disclose this but i just wanted to state
 
05:03:37.190 --> 05:03:37.200 align:start position:0%
that my housemate has returned home and
 
05:03:39.030 --> 05:03:39.040 align:start position:0%
is in another part of the house but
 
05:03:41.670 --> 05:03:41.680 align:start position:0%
maybe wandering through so i thought i
 
05:03:43.350 --> 05:03:43.360 align:start position:0%
would just put that on the record thank
 
05:03:43.360 --> 05:03:44.310 align:start position:0%
would just put that on the record thank
you

05:03:44.310 --> 05:03:44.320 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:03:48.390 --> 05:03:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:51.190 --> 05:03:51.200 align:start position:0%
thank you um actually in the last
 
05:03:53.350 --> 05:03:53.360 align:start position:0%
conversation you just maybe have to
 
05:03:56.470 --> 05:03:56.480 align:start position:0%
circle back to that issue about the cdc
 
05:03:56.480 --> 05:03:57.510 align:start position:0%
circle back to that issue about the cdc
list

05:03:57.510 --> 05:03:57.520 align:start position:0%
list
 
05:04:00.070 --> 05:04:00.080 align:start position:0%
and i did not catch this the first time
 
05:04:02.628 --> 05:04:02.638 align:start position:0%
through because we list the set of
 
05:04:04.948 --> 05:04:04.958 align:start position:0%
vaccines that can be given
 
05:04:07.430 --> 05:04:07.440 align:start position:0%
um and which have been approved but when
 
05:04:10.230 --> 05:04:10.240 align:start position:0%
one looks at the cdc guidance
 
05:04:11.910 --> 05:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
and i think this might have been
 
05:04:13.910 --> 05:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
commented on but i didn't quite catch it
 
05:04:13.920 --> 05:04:15.030 align:start position:0%
commented on but i didn't quite catch it
clearly

05:04:15.030 --> 05:04:15.040 align:start position:0%
clearly
 
05:04:17.430 --> 05:04:17.440 align:start position:0%
it is not that these are given at any
 
05:04:19.270 --> 05:04:19.280 align:start position:0%
point in time they are recommended by
 
05:04:20.868 --> 05:04:20.878 align:start position:0%
the cdc
 
05:04:23.430 --> 05:04:23.440 align:start position:0%
for specific age groups
 
05:04:25.590 --> 05:04:25.600 align:start position:0%
in other words like hpv is for a
 
05:04:27.670 --> 05:04:27.680 align:start position:0%
specific age group um
 
05:04:30.708 --> 05:04:30.718 align:start position:0%
zoster is recommended for specific age
 
05:04:30.718 --> 05:04:31.590 align:start position:0%
zoster is recommended for specific age
groups

05:04:31.590 --> 05:04:31.600 align:start position:0%
groups
 
05:04:34.230 --> 05:04:34.240 align:start position:0%
we do not have anything in this that
 
05:04:36.150 --> 05:04:36.160 align:start position:0%
restricts it to the age groups for which
 
05:04:39.430 --> 05:04:39.440 align:start position:0%
it is recommended which would mean that
 
05:04:41.910 --> 05:04:41.920 align:start position:0%
a pharmacist could follow this and give
 
05:04:44.550 --> 05:04:44.560 align:start position:0%
these vaccinations to anybody even if it
 
05:04:46.708 --> 05:04:46.718 align:start position:0%
is not recommended by the cdc for that
 
05:04:49.190 --> 05:04:49.200 align:start position:0%
specific age group and i'm wondering if
 
05:04:50.948 --> 05:04:50.958 align:start position:0%
we could still have the laundry list in
 
05:04:53.110 --> 05:04:53.120 align:start position:0%
so that we it so that we
 
05:04:54.948 --> 05:04:54.958 align:start position:0%
respect what representative cushman
 
05:04:54.958 --> 05:04:55.990 align:start position:0%
respect what representative cushman
wanted

05:04:55.990 --> 05:04:56.000 align:start position:0%
wanted
 
05:04:58.550 --> 05:04:58.560 align:start position:0%
but still add in a phrase it would say
 
05:05:01.430 --> 05:05:01.440 align:start position:0%
as recommended by the cdc
 
05:05:02.948 --> 05:05:02.958 align:start position:0%
so that we capture
 
05:05:05.270 --> 05:05:05.280 align:start position:0%
that age feature
 
05:05:07.270 --> 05:05:07.280 align:start position:0%
uh the demographic feature that is
 
05:05:09.110 --> 05:05:09.120 align:start position:0%
important in their recommendation
 
05:05:09.120 --> 05:05:10.070 align:start position:0%
important in their recommendation
because

05:05:10.070 --> 05:05:10.080 align:start position:0%
because
 
05:05:13.350 --> 05:05:13.360 align:start position:0%
they're different for different ages
 
05:05:15.590 --> 05:05:15.600 align:start position:0%
if i can address it mr chairman yes
 
05:05:17.990 --> 05:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
please mr representative connor i hear
 
05:05:19.190 --> 05:05:19.200 align:start position:0%
the concern but i think as a
 
05:05:19.200 --> 05:05:20.310 align:start position:0%
the concern but i think as a
professional

05:05:20.310 --> 05:05:20.320 align:start position:0%
professional
 
05:05:22.628 --> 05:05:22.638 align:start position:0%
um i do trust that they're going to
 
05:05:24.470 --> 05:05:24.480 align:start position:0%
follow the cdc guidelines without being
 
05:05:27.910 --> 05:05:27.920 align:start position:0%
instructed the statute to do that
 
05:05:29.910 --> 05:05:29.920 align:start position:0%
i don't think anyone else has that same
 
05:05:31.910 --> 05:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
statutory requirement
 
05:05:33.670 --> 05:05:33.680 align:start position:0%
physicians don't have it pas don't have
 
05:05:35.270 --> 05:05:35.280 align:start position:0%
it nurse practitioners don't have it
 
05:05:37.430 --> 05:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
natural paths don't have it so again
 
05:05:39.430 --> 05:05:39.440 align:start position:0%
back to my comment is whatever we do for
 
05:05:41.750 --> 05:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
one provider we should be ensure that
 
05:05:43.590 --> 05:05:43.600 align:start position:0%
all other providers live play by the
 
05:05:45.110 --> 05:05:45.120 align:start position:0%
same rules
 
05:05:47.510 --> 05:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
i can appreciate that thank you
 
05:05:55.110 --> 05:05:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:57.190 --> 05:05:57.200 align:start position:0%
uh just a point of information mr
 
05:05:59.270 --> 05:05:59.280 align:start position:0%
chairman please our speakers are
 
05:06:02.550 --> 05:06:02.560 align:start position:0%
referring to cdc guidelines i suspect
 
05:06:06.230 --> 05:06:06.240 align:start position:0%
they mean fda guidelines
 
05:06:07.830 --> 05:06:07.840 align:start position:0%
is that correct
 
05:06:07.840 --> 05:06:08.788 align:start position:0%
is that correct
no

05:06:08.788 --> 05:06:08.798 align:start position:0%
no
 
05:06:08.798 --> 05:06:13.910 align:start position:0%
no
no

05:06:13.910 --> 05:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:16.868 --> 05:06:16.878 align:start position:0%
oh the they are there are cdc guidelines
 
05:06:18.310 --> 05:06:18.320 align:start position:0%
that have been developed
 
05:06:20.788 --> 05:06:20.798 align:start position:0%
by the their immunization schedules by
 
05:06:22.390 --> 05:06:22.400 align:start position:0%
their immunization
 
05:06:24.390 --> 05:06:24.400 align:start position:0%
committees um i've got it pulled up
 
05:06:24.400 --> 05:06:25.510 align:start position:0%
committees um i've got it pulled up
finally

05:06:25.510 --> 05:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
finally
 
05:06:27.350 --> 05:06:27.360 align:start position:0%
recommended adult immunization schedule
 
05:06:28.470 --> 05:06:28.480 align:start position:0%
for adults
 
05:06:31.270 --> 05:06:31.280 align:start position:0%
for ages 19 and older and this comes
 
05:06:34.230 --> 05:06:34.240 align:start position:0%
from the cdc not the fda because the fda
 
05:06:36.310 --> 05:06:36.320 align:start position:0%
looks at the question of is it safe and
 
05:06:38.070 --> 05:06:38.080 align:start position:0%
is it effective the cdc is looking at
 
05:06:39.750 --> 05:06:39.760 align:start position:0%
the um
 
05:06:41.830 --> 05:06:41.840 align:start position:0%
at the public health issues as to when
 
05:06:43.750 --> 05:06:43.760 align:start position:0%
is the right time and for whom is it the
 
05:06:48.550 --> 05:06:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:51.030 --> 05:06:51.040 align:start position:0%
so for example even influenza different
 
05:06:54.070 --> 05:06:54.080 align:start position:0%
recommendations for older than younger
 
05:06:56.070 --> 05:06:56.080 align:start position:0%
but i think representative merchant has
 
05:06:58.230 --> 05:06:58.240 align:start position:0%
made a very good point and that is that
 
05:07:01.590 --> 05:07:01.600 align:start position:0%
we don't put that same restriction on a
 
05:07:03.110 --> 05:07:03.120 align:start position:0%
medical provider
 
05:07:05.430 --> 05:07:05.440 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to know it
 
05:07:07.030 --> 05:07:07.040 align:start position:0%
i guess it's because we're moving into
 
05:07:09.190 --> 05:07:09.200 align:start position:0%
newer uncharted territory
 
05:07:11.270 --> 05:07:11.280 align:start position:0%
and my question will be do we think that
 
05:07:11.280 --> 05:07:12.230 align:start position:0%
and my question will be do we think that
the

05:07:12.230 --> 05:07:12.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:07:13.910 --> 05:07:13.920 align:start position:0%
pharmacists will
 
05:07:13.920 --> 05:07:15.110 align:start position:0%
pharmacists will
be

05:07:15.110 --> 05:07:15.120 align:start position:0%
be
 
05:07:17.430 --> 05:07:17.440 align:start position:0%
referring to the cdc guidelines and make
 
05:07:17.440 --> 05:07:18.390 align:start position:0%
referring to the cdc guidelines and make
sure

05:07:18.390 --> 05:07:18.400 align:start position:0%
sure
 
05:07:20.550 --> 05:07:20.560 align:start position:0%
that they are following those cdc
 
05:07:23.750 --> 05:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
guidance as should the medical provider
 
05:07:23.760 --> 05:07:25.830 align:start position:0%
guidance as should the medical provider
fight

05:07:25.830 --> 05:07:25.840 align:start position:0%
fight
 
05:07:27.590 --> 05:07:27.600 align:start position:0%
canard gets a good point
 
05:07:30.070 --> 05:07:30.080 align:start position:0%
but also today a pharmacist can give a
 
05:07:31.830 --> 05:07:31.840 align:start position:0%
shingles vaccine
 
05:07:33.270 --> 05:07:33.280 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in there says they have
 
05:07:36.708 --> 05:07:36.718 align:start position:0%
to follow in statute cdc but we do
 
05:07:38.628 --> 05:07:38.638 align:start position:0%
expect that they understand the age
 
05:07:40.230 --> 05:07:40.240 align:start position:0%
requirements for a single vaccine that
 
05:07:42.470 --> 05:07:42.480 align:start position:0%
somebody coming in who's 18 years old
 
05:07:44.310 --> 05:07:44.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't get a shingles vaccine
 
05:07:44.320 --> 05:07:45.750 align:start position:0%
doesn't get a shingles vaccine
so

05:07:45.750 --> 05:07:45.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:07:47.350 --> 05:07:47.360 align:start position:0%
i want to say thank you for bringing up
 
05:07:49.270 --> 05:07:49.280 align:start position:0%
the point but i think the point has been
 
05:07:51.190 --> 05:07:51.200 align:start position:0%
addressed professionally by the
 
05:07:53.270 --> 05:07:53.280 align:start position:0%
pharmacists themselves

there on their deadline i'm now going to
 
05:11:15.270 --> 05:11:15.280 align:start position:0%
open the exec session on house bill 220
 
05:11:17.910 --> 05:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
and this is the incredible shrinking
 
05:11:17.920 --> 05:11:20.070 align:start position:0%
and this is the incredible shrinking
bill

05:11:20.070 --> 05:11:20.080 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:11:22.628 --> 05:11:22.638 align:start position:0%
lots of good work has gone into this and
 
05:11:24.868 --> 05:11:24.878 align:start position:0%
representative marsh who had an
 
05:11:27.190 --> 05:11:27.200 align:start position:0%
amendment yes i would like to move
 
05:11:31.510 --> 05:11:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:37.510 --> 05:11:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:40.550 --> 05:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
just just by point of record
 
05:11:44.788 --> 05:11:44.798 align:start position:0%
the original bill was already amended
 
05:11:44.798 --> 05:11:45.708 align:start position:0%
the original bill was already amended
by

05:11:45.708 --> 05:11:45.718 align:start position:0%
by
 
05:11:47.910 --> 05:11:47.920 align:start position:0%
334 h
 
05:11:49.670 --> 05:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
so this bill
 
05:11:49.680 --> 05:11:52.310 align:start position:0%
so this bill
replaces

05:11:52.310 --> 05:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
replaces
 
05:11:55.750 --> 05:11:55.760 align:start position:0%
everything except
 
05:11:55.760 --> 05:11:57.110 align:start position:0%
everything except
well

05:11:57.110 --> 05:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:11:59.030 --> 05:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i was waiting for a second
 
05:12:01.030 --> 05:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
of my motion before i started talking i
 
05:12:03.190 --> 05:12:03.200 align:start position:0%
think you're wise to do that who will
 
05:12:06.948 --> 05:12:06.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:08.708 --> 05:12:08.718 align:start position:0%
second cushman
 
05:12:10.708 --> 05:12:10.718 align:start position:0%
okay now
 
05:12:12.948 --> 05:12:12.958 align:start position:0%
yes to speak to my motion amendment
 
05:12:12.958 --> 05:12:14.868 align:start position:0%
yes to speak to my motion amendment
05758

05:12:14.868 --> 05:12:14.878 align:start position:0%
05758
 
05:12:17.430 --> 05:12:17.440 align:start position:0%
is identical to the amendment that we
 
05:12:19.270 --> 05:12:19.280 align:start position:0%
already adopted in the addition of a
 
05:12:21.830 --> 05:12:21.840 align:start position:0%
single sentence at the very end
 
05:12:24.230 --> 05:12:24.240 align:start position:0%
and the sentence was added this morning
 
05:12:25.910 --> 05:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
because the department of corrections
 
05:12:28.628 --> 05:12:28.638 align:start position:0%
brought a concern to us last night that
 
05:12:28.638 --> 05:12:29.830 align:start position:0%
brought a concern to us last night that
they

05:12:29.830 --> 05:12:29.840 align:start position:0%
they
 
05:12:32.310 --> 05:12:32.320 align:start position:0%
were concerned that their inmates who
 
05:12:34.550 --> 05:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
they were asking to participate in food
 
05:12:36.550 --> 05:12:36.560 align:start position:0%
service in
 
05:12:38.310 --> 05:12:38.320 align:start position:0%
the state prison
 
05:12:39.910 --> 05:12:39.920 align:start position:0%
they were currently trying to have them
 
05:12:42.230 --> 05:12:42.240 align:start position:0%
vaccinated for hepatitis a and total
 
05:12:45.110 --> 05:12:45.120 align:start position:0%
hepatitis a operate in the state prison
 
05:12:47.190 --> 05:12:47.200 align:start position:0%
i believe that clearly meets the direct
 
05:12:48.628 --> 05:12:48.638 align:start position:0%
threat uh
 
05:12:50.708 --> 05:12:50.718 align:start position:0%
criteria that's here but they were not
 
05:12:52.708 --> 05:12:52.718 align:start position:0%
convinced they'd be qualified as
 
05:12:55.190 --> 05:12:55.200 align:start position:0%
employees so they asked that we had an
 
05:12:57.110 --> 05:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
additional sentence to make it clear
 
05:12:59.350 --> 05:12:59.360 align:start position:0%
that they felt under the same
 
05:13:01.190 --> 05:13:01.200 align:start position:0%
criteria this was already in humanity
 
05:13:03.110 --> 05:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
adopted by definition
 
05:13:07.270 --> 05:13:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:11.030 --> 05:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
any discussion on
 
05:13:15.670 --> 05:13:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:17.750 --> 05:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
let me say because i have the paperwork
 
05:13:19.430 --> 05:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
on this um
 
05:13:22.550 --> 05:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
at the appearing on the original bill
 
05:13:23.948 --> 05:13:23.958 align:start position:0%
there were
 
05:13:27.510 --> 05:13:27.520 align:start position:0%
245 people
 
05:13:30.470 --> 05:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
signing in to
 
05:13:32.310 --> 05:13:32.320 align:start position:0%
support the bill and it seems like
 
05:13:35.590 --> 05:13:35.600 align:start position:0%
africa wanted to testify there were 52
 
05:13:39.590 --> 05:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
people opposing and one person neutral
 
05:13:42.070 --> 05:13:42.080 align:start position:0%
so that's that's the box score for the
 
05:13:42.080 --> 05:13:44.070 align:start position:0%
so that's that's the box score for the
hearing

05:13:44.070 --> 05:13:44.080 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
05:13:45.750 --> 05:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
any other
 
05:13:45.760 --> 05:13:47.990 align:start position:0%
any other
discussion

05:13:47.990 --> 05:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
05:13:50.708 --> 05:13:50.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:52.470 --> 05:13:52.480 align:start position:0%
representative woods
 
05:13:53.910 --> 05:13:53.920 align:start position:0%
oh sorry
 
05:13:55.590 --> 05:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
relative to the numbers sometimes it can
 
05:13:57.430 --> 05:13:57.440 align:start position:0%
be very confusing because
 
05:13:59.430 --> 05:13:59.440 align:start position:0%
some of the material that comes out and
 
05:14:01.750 --> 05:14:01.760 align:start position:0%
you may have already adjusted for this
 
05:14:04.868 --> 05:14:04.878 align:start position:0%
sometimes the opinions appear
 
05:14:07.510 --> 05:14:07.520 align:start position:0%
at least in my inbox uh before the
 
05:14:09.270 --> 05:14:09.280 align:start position:0%
amendments come through
 
05:14:10.470 --> 05:14:10.480 align:start position:0%
and therefore it's a very different
 
05:14:12.150 --> 05:14:12.160 align:start position:0%
flavor uh and you may have already
 
05:14:14.550 --> 05:14:14.560 align:start position:0%
adjusted for that perhaps
 
05:14:16.948 --> 05:14:16.958 align:start position:0%
no this is why some committees in my
 
05:14:16.958 --> 05:14:18.150 align:start position:0%
no this is why some committees in my
experience

05:14:18.150 --> 05:14:18.160 align:start position:0%
experience
 
05:14:19.670 --> 05:14:19.680 align:start position:0%
don't tell
 
05:14:21.670 --> 05:14:21.680 align:start position:0%
how many people signed in one way or the
 
05:14:21.680 --> 05:14:22.948 align:start position:0%
how many people signed in one way or the
other

05:14:22.948 --> 05:14:22.958 align:start position:0%
other
 
05:14:24.948 --> 05:14:24.958 align:start position:0%
um i was asked to do that and when i
 
05:14:26.628 --> 05:14:26.638 align:start position:0%
didn't lose the paperwork i try to
 
05:14:28.628 --> 05:14:28.638 align:start position:0%
remember to do that but yeah you can
 
05:14:32.550 --> 05:14:32.560 align:start position:0%
also get a block group of people
 
05:14:35.190 --> 05:14:35.200 align:start position:0%
just flooding
 
05:14:37.670 --> 05:14:37.680 align:start position:0%
the paperwork here and you may not
 
05:14:39.910 --> 05:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
necessarily know where they're from
 
05:14:42.550 --> 05:14:42.560 align:start position:0%
and so then that also skews the data so
 
05:14:45.270 --> 05:14:45.280 align:start position:0%
i personally put almost no stock and
 
05:14:47.510 --> 05:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
you know if a thousand people testify
 
05:14:49.510 --> 05:14:49.520 align:start position:0%
sign in one way and 50 the other way
 
05:14:51.590 --> 05:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
that could simply mean somebody's better
 
05:14:51.600 --> 05:14:52.708 align:start position:0%
that could simply mean somebody's better
organized

05:14:52.708 --> 05:14:52.718 align:start position:0%
organized
 
05:14:54.948 --> 05:14:54.958 align:start position:0%
not necessarily that the thousand
 
05:14:57.270 --> 05:14:57.280 align:start position:0%
represents the groundswell so thank you
 
05:14:59.190 --> 05:14:59.200 align:start position:0%
for that
 
05:15:06.628 --> 05:15:06.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:11.830 --> 05:15:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:14.470 --> 05:15:14.480 align:start position:0%
thank you i i also just wanted to make a
 
05:15:17.510 --> 05:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
quick note about
 
05:15:17.520 --> 05:15:18.868 align:start position:0%
quick note about
that

05:15:18.868 --> 05:15:18.878 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:15:21.910 --> 05:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
about the sign ins and the other thing
 
05:15:24.628 --> 05:15:24.638 align:start position:0%
is that it seems to me that we have
 
05:15:27.670 --> 05:15:27.680 align:start position:0%
received a significant amount of input
 
05:15:29.350 --> 05:15:29.360 align:start position:0%
subsequent to
 
05:15:30.390 --> 05:15:30.400 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
05:15:33.990 --> 05:15:34.000 align:start position:0%
signing in sheet having closed and my
 
05:15:36.230 --> 05:15:36.240 align:start position:0%
understanding would be that those also
 
05:15:37.750 --> 05:15:37.760 align:start position:0%
am i correct in thinking that those are
 
05:15:38.948 --> 05:15:38.958 align:start position:0%
also not
 
05:15:38.958 --> 05:15:40.070 align:start position:0%
also not
um

05:15:40.070 --> 05:15:40.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:15:42.550 --> 05:15:42.560 align:start position:0%
included in the final tallies
 
05:15:45.270 --> 05:15:45.280 align:start position:0%
that is correct the tally is for people
 
05:15:47.590 --> 05:15:47.600 align:start position:0%
who signed in one way or the other about
 
05:15:52.708 --> 05:15:52.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:52.718 --> 05:15:55.030 align:start position:0%
 
unless

05:15:55.030 --> 05:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
unless
 
05:15:57.590 --> 05:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
committee services
 
05:16:01.510 --> 05:16:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:07.590 --> 05:16:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:09.510 --> 05:16:09.520 align:start position:0%
she may be in another committee i
 
05:16:11.670 --> 05:16:11.680 align:start position:0%
apologize could you repeat the question
 
05:16:13.750 --> 05:16:13.760 align:start position:0%
yeah the question is when i'm given the
 
05:16:16.110 --> 05:16:16.120 align:start position:0%
tally that i just announced there were
 
05:16:19.750 --> 05:16:19.760 align:start position:0%
245 in support and 52 in opposition that
 
05:16:22.310 --> 05:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
was to the original bill correct
 
05:16:25.030 --> 05:16:25.040 align:start position:0%
correct i've never i we don't get
 
05:16:26.868 --> 05:16:26.878 align:start position:0%
updates after
 
05:16:28.868 --> 05:16:28.878 align:start position:0%
uh we had a long discussion and then
 
05:16:30.310 --> 05:16:30.320 align:start position:0%
somebody says hey i'm going to bring an
 
05:16:32.390 --> 05:16:32.400 align:start position:0%
amendment to such and such there's no
 
05:16:35.510 --> 05:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
tally on what people will
 
05:16:36.550 --> 05:16:36.560 align:start position:0%
write in
 
05:16:38.868 --> 05:16:38.878 align:start position:0%
to express their opinions on
 
05:16:40.390 --> 05:16:40.400 align:start position:0%
them correct
 
05:16:43.030 --> 05:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
no not typically um some people will add
 
05:16:45.030 --> 05:16:45.040 align:start position:0%
it into um
 
05:16:46.470 --> 05:16:46.480 align:start position:0%
they'll add it in creatively but
 
05:16:47.990 --> 05:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
otherwise there's there's no mechanism
 
05:16:49.110 --> 05:16:49.120 align:start position:0%
for that
 
05:16:51.750 --> 05:16:51.760 align:start position:0%
okay yeah sure is there any way is there
 
05:16:53.270 --> 05:16:53.280 align:start position:0%
any way for the public to see an
 
05:16:55.990 --> 05:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
amendment i thought there was not
 
05:16:56.000 --> 05:16:57.350 align:start position:0%
amendment i thought there was not
yes

05:16:57.350 --> 05:16:57.360 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:16:59.750 --> 05:16:59.760 align:start position:0%
you can see the amendments now yes house
 
05:17:01.510 --> 05:17:01.520 align:start position:0%
committee services has made them
 
05:17:03.990 --> 05:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
available they become available
 
05:17:05.830 --> 05:17:05.840 align:start position:0%
once they've been adopted that's always
 
05:17:08.070 --> 05:17:08.080 align:start position:0%
been the case but ant house committee
 
05:17:09.910 --> 05:17:09.920 align:start position:0%
services i believe is
 
05:17:12.390 --> 05:17:12.400 align:start position:0%
creating a process that they can be made
 
05:17:15.670 --> 05:17:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:17.750 --> 05:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
so to work in progress i know that was
 
05:17:17.760 --> 05:17:19.990 align:start position:0%
so to work in progress i know that was
bill

05:17:19.990 --> 05:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:17:24.230 --> 05:17:24.240 align:start position:0%
any further discussion on the amendments
 
05:17:24.240 --> 05:17:28.230 align:start position:0%
any further discussion on the amendments
575-h

05:17:28.230 --> 05:17:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:32.070 --> 05:17:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:34.628 --> 05:17:34.638 align:start position:0%
yes um
 
05:17:37.750 --> 05:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
i'm getting a little confused um trying
 
05:17:39.430 --> 05:17:39.440 align:start position:0%
to put the amendment next to the
 
05:17:41.830 --> 05:17:41.840 align:start position:0%
original bill and i wonder if someone
 
05:17:43.590 --> 05:17:43.600 align:start position:0%
who's more knowledgeable than i could
 
05:17:45.190 --> 05:17:45.200 align:start position:0%
speak to
 
05:17:45.200 --> 05:17:46.310 align:start position:0%
speak to
um

05:17:46.310 --> 05:17:46.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:17:48.070 --> 05:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
as the bill
 
05:17:50.470 --> 05:17:50.480 align:start position:0%
would be amended if we vote on vote to
 
05:17:53.670 --> 05:17:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:56.070 --> 05:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
what would actually be different
 
05:17:57.750 --> 05:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
than the way things
 
05:18:01.590 --> 05:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:03.910 --> 05:18:03.920 align:start position:0%
representative march yes we already
 
05:18:06.390 --> 05:18:06.400 align:start position:0%
adopted amendment uh
 
05:18:09.190 --> 05:18:09.200 align:start position:0%
zero three four four h which replaced
 
05:18:11.750 --> 05:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
section one with the new section one and
 
05:18:15.670 --> 05:18:15.680 align:start position:0%
left the enact the uh uh
 
05:18:17.430 --> 05:18:17.440 align:start position:0%
when it becomes effective clause in
 
05:18:19.350 --> 05:18:19.360 align:start position:0%
effect uh
 
05:18:19.360 --> 05:18:20.550 align:start position:0%
effect uh
this

05:18:20.550 --> 05:18:20.560 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:18:22.230 --> 05:18:22.240 align:start position:0%
i i could have just added to that
 
05:18:23.910 --> 05:18:23.920 align:start position:0%
section one but i did the whole thing
 
05:18:26.150 --> 05:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
again because it was easier vote for ols
 
05:18:27.670 --> 05:18:27.680 align:start position:0%
and for everybody in the call to see
 
05:18:29.910 --> 05:18:29.920 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about here
 
05:18:32.470 --> 05:18:32.480 align:start position:0%
and basically this replaces the section
 
05:18:34.150 --> 05:18:34.160 align:start position:0%
one in the original build with a new
 
05:18:37.830 --> 05:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
section one um which as you can see is
 
05:18:41.110 --> 05:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:42.310 --> 05:18:42.320 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
05:18:44.310 --> 05:18:44.320 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
05:18:47.190 --> 05:18:47.200 align:start position:0%
so my question is um practically
 
05:18:47.200 --> 05:18:48.788 align:start position:0%
so my question is um practically
speaking

05:18:48.788 --> 05:18:48.798 align:start position:0%
speaking
 
05:18:51.510 --> 05:18:51.520 align:start position:0%
what will be different if we pass this
 
05:18:51.520 --> 05:18:52.788 align:start position:0%
what will be different if we pass this
bill

05:18:52.788 --> 05:18:52.798 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:18:54.948 --> 05:18:54.958 align:start position:0%
than is the case without passing this
 
05:18:54.958 --> 05:18:59.190 align:start position:0%
than is the case without passing this
bill

05:18:59.190 --> 05:18:59.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:59.200 --> 05:19:00.948 align:start position:0%
 
that's

05:19:00.948 --> 05:19:00.958 align:start position:0%
that's
 
05:19:02.628 --> 05:19:02.638 align:start position:0%
that's always a good question and i
 
05:19:04.230 --> 05:19:04.240 align:start position:0%
believe that question is more in order
 
05:19:07.910 --> 05:19:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:10.390 --> 05:19:10.400 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm wondering
 
05:19:12.230 --> 05:19:12.240 align:start position:0%
what is the purpose of this bill at this
 
05:19:15.030 --> 05:19:15.040 align:start position:0%
point i think it you know before
 
05:19:17.030 --> 05:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
when there were more things in it some
 
05:19:19.350 --> 05:19:19.360 align:start position:0%
of which i disagreed with
 
05:19:21.670 --> 05:19:21.680 align:start position:0%
i i kind of understood the purpose of it
 
05:19:24.070 --> 05:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
now i'm not really clear about what
 
05:19:25.670 --> 05:19:25.680 align:start position:0%
we're actually
 
05:19:27.910 --> 05:19:27.920 align:start position:0%
changing by passing this bill my
 
05:19:30.708 --> 05:19:30.718 align:start position:0%
understanding is that uh
 
05:19:33.750 --> 05:19:33.760 align:start position:0%
various citizens are concerned that they
 
05:19:35.510 --> 05:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
that they will be mandated to have
 
05:19:37.990 --> 05:19:38.000 align:start position:0%
certain uh particularly vaccinations as
 
05:19:39.990 --> 05:19:40.000 align:start position:0%
a condition of employment
 
05:19:43.110 --> 05:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
and that may very well be a violation of
 
05:19:45.350 --> 05:19:45.360 align:start position:0%
uh the federal law it's enforced by the
 
05:19:47.350 --> 05:19:47.360 align:start position:0%
equal employment opportunity commission
 
05:19:48.628 --> 05:19:48.638 align:start position:0%
but in fact there's a rather high
 
05:19:50.708 --> 05:19:50.718 align:start position:0%
barrier to appeal one's case to that
 
05:19:52.150 --> 05:19:52.160 align:start position:0%
group if
 
05:19:54.310 --> 05:19:54.320 align:start position:0%
we test this bill and the form that
 
05:19:55.830 --> 05:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
would be where we could pass this
 
05:19:57.990 --> 05:19:58.000 align:start position:0%
amendment then that would clearly be in
 
05:19:59.190 --> 05:19:59.200 align:start position:0%
state law
 
05:20:01.110 --> 05:20:01.120 align:start position:0%
and i think it would be much more
 
05:20:03.910 --> 05:20:03.920 align:start position:0%
accessible to citizens than it would be
 
05:20:09.430 --> 05:20:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:11.590 --> 05:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:20:15.510 --> 05:20:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:17.830 --> 05:20:17.840 align:start position:0%
and let me add to that i do believe that
 
05:20:21.910 --> 05:20:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:25.110 --> 05:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
right to bodily integrity it's actually
 
05:20:27.510 --> 05:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
implied in current law passing this
 
05:20:29.830 --> 05:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
still makes it explicit
 
05:20:32.230 --> 05:20:32.240 align:start position:0%
so i i i think in that sense it's an
 
05:20:34.070 --> 05:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
improvement that i agree with you that
 
05:20:36.150 --> 05:20:36.160 align:start position:0%
that may be less of a change than some
 
05:20:45.590 --> 05:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:47.510 --> 05:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
05:20:48.868 --> 05:20:48.878 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
05:20:50.470 --> 05:20:50.480 align:start position:0%
uh yes
 
05:20:51.510 --> 05:20:51.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:20:51.520 --> 05:20:52.550 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

05:20:52.550 --> 05:20:52.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:20:54.868 --> 05:20:54.878 align:start position:0%
i think answer representative sebero's
 
05:20:54.878 --> 05:20:55.910 align:start position:0%
i think answer representative sebero's
um

05:20:55.910 --> 05:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:20:55.920 --> 05:20:56.948 align:start position:0%
um
comment

05:20:56.948 --> 05:20:56.958 align:start position:0%
comment
 
05:20:59.350 --> 05:20:59.360 align:start position:0%
what i found with the amendment was it
 
05:21:01.030 --> 05:21:01.040 align:start position:0%
provided clarity
 
05:21:02.788 --> 05:21:02.798 align:start position:0%
over the original bill
 
05:21:04.470 --> 05:21:04.480 align:start position:0%
so the original bill was kind of broad
 
05:21:04.480 --> 05:21:05.510 align:start position:0%
so the original bill was kind of broad
but

05:21:05.510 --> 05:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:21:07.270 --> 05:21:07.280 align:start position:0%
using the amendment it sort of provides
 
05:21:09.270 --> 05:21:09.280 align:start position:0%
the clarity that i was looking for

05:25:03.430 --> 05:25:03.440 align:start position:0%
um i will just say that i'm really
 
05:25:05.670 --> 05:25:05.680 align:start position:0%
conflict conflicted about this bill on
 
05:25:09.270 --> 05:25:09.280 align:start position:0%
the one hand i really appreciate all the
 
05:25:11.190 --> 05:25:11.200 align:start position:0%
compromise that's gone into it and all
 
05:25:13.110 --> 05:25:13.120 align:start position:0%
the thought that's gone into it on the
 
05:25:15.350 --> 05:25:15.360 align:start position:0%
other hand i feel like um being in the
 
05:25:17.190 --> 05:25:17.200 align:start position:0%
legislature has made me more a little
 
05:25:19.270 --> 05:25:19.280 align:start position:0%
bit more of a libertarian
 
05:25:21.350 --> 05:25:21.360 align:start position:0%
and um
 
05:25:22.868 --> 05:25:22.878 align:start position:0%
kind of makes me feel like we don't have
 
05:25:24.788 --> 05:25:24.798 align:start position:0%
to have a a
 
05:25:27.350 --> 05:25:27.360 align:start position:0%
a law about everything and it seems like
 
05:25:29.670 --> 05:25:29.680 align:start position:0%
at this point this is just a law that
 
05:25:31.190 --> 05:25:31.200 align:start position:0%
we're passing
 
05:25:33.910 --> 05:25:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:36.390 --> 05:25:36.400 align:start position:0%
people feel okay about something that's
 
05:25:38.628 --> 05:25:38.638 align:start position:0%
already in practice
 
05:25:38.638 --> 05:25:39.030 align:start position:0%
already in practice
so

05:25:39.030 --> 05:25:39.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:25:39.040 --> 05:25:40.788 align:start position:0%
so

representative weber
 
05:25:54.390 --> 05:25:54.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman as you all know i
 
05:25:56.788 --> 05:25:56.798 align:start position:0%
was fiercely opposed to the bill when as
 
05:25:59.670 --> 05:25:59.680 align:start position:0%
it was originally drafted because i was
 
05:26:03.510 --> 05:26:03.520 align:start position:0%
very concerned about the intersection of
 
05:26:03.520 --> 05:26:04.628 align:start position:0%
very concerned about the intersection of
every

05:26:04.628 --> 05:26:04.638 align:start position:0%
every
 
05:26:07.670 --> 05:26:07.680 align:start position:0%
possible unwanted medical intervention
 
05:26:09.270 --> 05:26:09.280 align:start position:0%
and a
 
05:26:11.990 --> 05:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
total non-discrimination clause
 
05:26:14.628 --> 05:26:14.638 align:start position:0%
but i have to say that i am very much in
 
05:26:17.590 --> 05:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
favor of the statement that people have
 
05:26:19.430 --> 05:26:19.440 align:start position:0%
control over what
 
05:26:19.440 --> 05:26:20.470 align:start position:0%
control over what
um

05:26:20.470 --> 05:26:20.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:26:23.270 --> 05:26:23.280 align:start position:0%
goes into their bodies and what medical
 
05:26:25.190 --> 05:26:25.200 align:start position:0%
procedures they
 
05:26:29.590 --> 05:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
uh wish to incur so
 
05:26:32.150 --> 05:26:32.160 align:start position:0%
i think that having that statement
 
05:26:32.160 --> 05:26:33.910 align:start position:0%
i think that having that statement
explicit

05:26:33.910 --> 05:26:33.920 align:start position:0%
explicit
 
05:26:37.430 --> 05:26:37.440 align:start position:0%
is perhaps a very good thing
 
05:26:37.440 --> 05:26:39.430 align:start position:0%
is perhaps a very good thing
and

05:26:39.430 --> 05:26:39.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:26:39.440 --> 05:26:40.708 align:start position:0%
and

05:26:40.708 --> 05:26:40.718 align:start position:0%

05:26:40.718 --> 05:26:42.948 align:start position:0%
given
the

05:26:42.948 --> 05:26:42.958 align:start position:0%

two

05:26:47.910 --> 05:26:47.920 align:start position:0%
two
 
05:26:50.788 --> 05:26:50.798 align:start position:0%
i am now able to vote for the bill and i
 
05:26:53.430 --> 05:26:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:55.350 --> 05:26:55.360 align:start position:0%
the medical freedom statement is an
 
05:26:57.990 --> 05:26:58.000 align:start position:0%
important statement that applies to so
 
05:27:00.150 --> 05:27:00.160 align:start position:0%
many different areas of our
 
05:27:02.708 --> 05:27:02.718 align:start position:0%
medical lives that
 
05:27:05.270 --> 05:27:05.280 align:start position:0%

no amendments have been forthcoming at

representative marsh
 
05:30:10.230 --> 05:30:10.240 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman uh i believe
 
05:30:12.310 --> 05:30:12.320 align:start position:0%
that the department has done the best it
 
05:30:15.110 --> 05:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
can and is continuing to improve the
 
05:30:17.990 --> 05:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
covet 19 dashboard and i further
 
05:30:19.910 --> 05:30:19.920 align:start position:0%
appealed that the
 
05:30:22.230 --> 05:30:22.240 align:start position:0%
issue about
 
05:30:25.110 --> 05:30:25.120 align:start position:0%
access to health care and
 
05:30:27.750 --> 05:30:27.760 align:start position:0%
differences in uh outcomes amongst
 
05:30:30.548 --> 05:30:30.558 align:start position:0%
various groups and seeing address by the
 
05:30:32.628 --> 05:30:32.638 align:start position:0%
shopship commission and so therefore i
 
05:30:34.310 --> 05:30:34.320 align:start position:0%
do not feel that there's need for an
 
05:30:36.548 --> 05:30:36.558 align:start position:0%
additional commission and therefore i
 
05:30:38.708 --> 05:30:38.718 align:start position:0%
would like to move itl and hospital
 
05:30:38.718 --> 05:30:51.510 align:start position:0%

about a few concerns
 
05:31:08.070 --> 05:31:08.080 align:start position:0%
because the senate is working on
 
05:31:10.548 --> 05:31:10.558 align:start position:0%
something similar to this and it might
 
05:31:13.830 --> 05:31:13.840 align:start position:0%
well be addressed there and certainly

05:41:03.990 --> 05:41:04.000 align:start position:0%
three
 
05:41:05.110 --> 05:41:05.120 align:start position:0%
where we
 
05:41:07.110 --> 05:41:07.120 align:start position:0%
want to reduce the cost both to
 
05:41:08.948 --> 05:41:08.958 align:start position:0%
individuals and overall in the health
 
05:41:11.270 --> 05:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
care system yeah that's important
 
05:41:11.280 --> 05:41:12.788 align:start position:0%
care system yeah that's important
because

05:41:12.788 --> 05:41:12.798 align:start position:0%
because
 
05:41:15.110 --> 05:41:15.120 align:start position:0%
with cost shifting cost individuals may
 
05:41:17.110 --> 05:41:17.120 align:start position:0%
not be reduced when we are not reducing
 
05:41:19.670 --> 05:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
the cost of the health care system and
 
05:41:22.708 --> 05:41:22.718 align:start position:0%
the last has to do with uh
 
05:41:25.590 --> 05:41:25.600 align:start position:0%
membership on the commission uh where
 
05:41:28.230 --> 05:41:28.240 align:start position:0%
the the uh josiah martin member we
 
05:41:28.240 --> 05:41:29.670 align:start position:0%
the the uh josiah martin member we
anticipate

05:41:29.670 --> 05:41:29.680 align:start position:0%
anticipate
 
05:41:32.310 --> 05:41:32.320 align:start position:0%
the freelance healthcare solution so i
 
05:41:34.788 --> 05:41:34.798 align:start position:0%
believe that we have uh addressed those
 
05:41:36.708 --> 05:41:36.718 align:start position:0%
concerns so that those people have a
 
05:41:39.190 --> 05:41:39.200 align:start position:0%
voice at the table
 
05:41:41.750 --> 05:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:46.628 --> 05:41:46.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:48.070 --> 05:41:48.080 align:start position:0%
and see
 
05:41:49.750 --> 05:41:49.760 align:start position:0%
your faces because if we're looking at
 
05:41:51.830 --> 05:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
the good amendment
 
05:41:54.230 --> 05:41:54.240 align:start position:0%
representative snow has his hand up

down to get my shot and i'm back
 
05:42:11.190 --> 05:42:11.200 align:start position:0%

the

05:42:50.470 --> 05:42:50.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:42:53.910 --> 05:42:53.920 align:start position:0%
only change between those two amendments
 
05:42:54.948 --> 05:42:54.958 align:start position:0%
is that
 
05:42:57.670 --> 05:42:57.680 align:start position:0%
in the prior amendment there were two uh
 
05:42:59.590 --> 05:42:59.600 align:start position:0%
representatives from hospitals number
 
05:43:02.310 --> 05:43:02.320 align:start position:0%
two and an additional representative of
 
05:43:04.628 --> 05:43:04.638 align:start position:0%
the hospital added later on in the
 
05:43:07.110 --> 05:43:07.120 align:start position:0%
amendment in this amendment as you can
 
05:43:11.110 --> 05:43:11.120 align:start position:0%
see on page 3 uh lines 16 through 18 we
 
05:43:12.470 --> 05:43:12.480 align:start position:0%
have amalgamated the three
 
05:43:14.708 --> 05:43:14.718 align:start position:0%
representatives of some hospitals the
 
05:43:16.150 --> 05:43:16.160 align:start position:0%
new one that's being added to the
 
05:43:16.160 --> 05:43:17.510 align:start position:0%
new one that's being added to the
commission

05:43:17.510 --> 05:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
commission
 
05:43:19.110 --> 05:43:19.120 align:start position:0%
is a uh
 
05:43:21.350 --> 05:43:21.360 align:start position:0%
one from an academic medical center
 
05:43:24.948 --> 05:43:24.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:43.030 --> 05:43:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:45.110 --> 05:43:45.120 align:start position:0%
anybody else
 
05:43:47.990 --> 05:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
but i think there we go
 
05:43:49.670 --> 05:43:49.680 align:start position:0%
i don't see
 
05:43:53.510 --> 05:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:55.270 --> 05:43:55.280 align:start position:0%
yeah mr chairman
 
05:43:57.830 --> 05:43:57.840 align:start position:0%
yes representative for clarity so
 
05:43:59.430 --> 05:43:59.440 align:start position:0%

shaw ship commission when the amendment
 
05:44:14.948 --> 05:44:14.958 align:start position:0%
the fire event was discussed at the
 
05:44:16.708 --> 05:44:16.718 align:start position:0%
commission they thought that that was
 
05:44:18.708 --> 05:44:18.718 align:start position:0%
clearer and i agree
 
05:44:20.708 --> 05:44:20.718 align:start position:0%

uh representative gay oh what is
 
05:44:29.750 --> 05:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
an academic medical center is that like
 
05:44:29.760 --> 05:44:30.708 align:start position:0%
an academic medical center is that like
a

05:44:30.708 --> 05:44:30.718 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:44:33.110 --> 05:44:33.120 align:start position:0%

like dartmouth yes
 
05:44:38.948 --> 05:44:38.958 align:start position:0%
but it does not have to have a medical
 
05:44:40.868 --> 05:44:40.878 align:start position:0%
school attached correct it could have
 
05:44:42.708 --> 05:44:42.718 align:start position:0%
interns and residents
 
05:44:48.070 --> 05:44:48.080 align:start position:0%

05:46:29.440 --> 05:46:32.948 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions about the
amendment

05:46:32.948 --> 05:46:32.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:34.948 --> 05:46:34.958 align:start position:0%
mr chairman would you like me to ask the
 
05:46:36.310 --> 05:46:36.320 align:start position:0%
clerk to call the world because there
 
05:46:38.070 --> 05:46:38.080 align:start position:0%
are no further questions i would like to
 
05:46:40.310 --> 05:46:40.320 align:start position:0%
give representative milton about another
 
05:46:41.670 --> 05:46:41.680 align:start position:0%
30 seconds
 
05:46:43.590 --> 05:46:43.600 align:start position:0%
but someone please ask another question
 
05:46:51.910 --> 05:46:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:59.270 --> 05:46:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:01.030 --> 05:47:01.040 align:start position:0%
if you're looking for filler i've got
 
05:47:03.190 --> 05:47:03.200 align:start position:0%
something um
 
05:47:05.510 --> 05:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
so we should pass if we should adopt
 
05:47:07.030 --> 05:47:07.040 align:start position:0%
this amendment
 
05:47:09.430 --> 05:47:09.440 align:start position:0%
and um
 
05:47:12.070 --> 05:47:12.080 align:start position:0%
what is the what is the major thrust of
 
05:47:13.990 --> 05:47:14.000 align:start position:0%
this bill that we're passing what will
 
05:47:15.350 --> 05:47:15.360 align:start position:0%
we be
 
05:47:17.030 --> 05:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
doing with the amendment
 
05:47:18.628 --> 05:47:18.638 align:start position:0%
well as you recall
 
05:47:20.708 --> 05:47:20.718 align:start position:0%
the original bill was would have
 
05:47:23.190 --> 05:47:23.200 align:start position:0%
repealed this commission and that's
 
05:47:24.788 --> 05:47:24.798 align:start position:0%
certain members and i believe those are
 
05:47:26.310 --> 05:47:26.320 align:start position:0%
the members that
 
05:47:27.830 --> 05:47:27.840 align:start position:0%
represent the
 
05:47:30.070 --> 05:47:30.080 align:start position:0%
asked us about earlier did not feel that
 
05:47:31.510 --> 05:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
they had a seat at the table in
 
05:47:33.670 --> 05:47:33.680 align:start position:0%
developing the state health assessment
 
05:47:35.750 --> 05:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
state health improvement plan uh what
 
05:47:39.030 --> 05:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
this amendment does is it uh recognizes
 
05:47:41.750 --> 05:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
the fact that we need to to incorporate
 
05:47:44.708 --> 05:47:44.718 align:start position:0%
the input of all concerned uh citizens
 
05:47:47.190 --> 05:47:47.200 align:start position:0%
and interested parties in developing
 
05:47:50.788 --> 05:47:50.798 align:start position:0%
this plan and it was the consensus of
 
05:47:52.708 --> 05:47:52.718 align:start position:0%
the group and of the commission that
 
05:47:54.230 --> 05:47:54.240 align:start position:0%
this addressed the concerns and
 
05:47:55.910 --> 05:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
therefore we do not need to reveal the
 
05:47:58.070 --> 05:47:58.080 align:start position:0%
commission but we will instead modify
 
05:47:59.910 --> 05:47:59.920 align:start position:0%
the commission slightly so that
 
05:48:04.230 --> 05:48:04.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:10.150 --> 05:48:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:10.160 --> 05:48:16.708 align:start position:0%
 
else

05:48:16.708 --> 05:48:16.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:20.708 --> 05:48:20.718 align:start position:0%
and we are voting on amendments
 
05:48:25.350 --> 05:48:25.360 align:start position:0%
zero four eight eight to house bill 157
 
05:48:27.830 --> 05:48:27.840 align:start position:0%
moved by representative marsh seconded
 
05:48:30.390 --> 05:48:30.400 align:start position:0%

that we made clear that that is
 
05:54:33.110 --> 05:54:33.120 align:start position:0%
something that is uh from the
 
05:54:34.708 --> 05:54:34.718 align:start position:0%
centers for medicaid services on the
 
05:54:37.110 --> 05:54:37.120 align:start position:0%
federal level and is
 
05:54:38.628 --> 05:54:38.638 align:start position:0%
pretty much
 
05:54:40.310 --> 05:54:40.320 align:start position:0%
going to be a part of this process
 
05:54:50.470 --> 05:54:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:53.030 --> 05:54:53.040 align:start position:0%

05:55:25.830 --> 05:55:25.840 align:start position:0%
can uh check to see how they're doing
 
05:55:28.788 --> 05:55:28.798 align:start position:0%
when they look at facilities um
 
05:55:28.798 --> 05:55:29.590 align:start position:0%
when they look at facilities um
the

05:55:29.590 --> 05:55:29.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:55:32.150 --> 05:55:32.160 align:start position:0%
term measures was added because that is
 
05:55:34.788 --> 05:55:34.798 align:start position:0%
the term that's often used uh in
 
05:55:38.230 --> 05:55:38.240 align:start position:0%
reviewing sites uh that the uh these uh
 
05:55:41.830 --> 05:55:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:41.840 --> 05:55:43.030 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:55:43.030 --> 05:55:43.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:55:45.350 --> 05:55:45.360 align:start position:0%
the only other uh question that came up
 
05:55:48.390 --> 05:55:48.400 align:start position:0%
uh was relative to line six about
 
05:55:53.270 --> 05:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:55.350 --> 05:55:55.360 align:start position:0%
again emphasizing that
 
05:55:57.350 --> 05:55:57.360 align:start position:0%
i think the concern was
 
05:55:59.270 --> 05:55:59.280 align:start position:0%
these might be mandated these are not
 
05:55:59.280 --> 05:56:00.788 align:start position:0%
these might be mandated these are not
mandated

05:56:00.788 --> 05:56:00.798 align:start position:0%
mandated
 
05:56:03.510 --> 05:56:03.520 align:start position:0%
these are survey
 
05:56:05.270 --> 05:56:05.280 align:start position:0%
measures only
 
05:56:08.070 --> 05:56:08.080 align:start position:0%
so that we can as a state keep ourselves
 
05:56:10.628 --> 05:56:10.638 align:start position:0%
posted as to what the status of new
 
05:56:12.948 --> 05:56:12.958 align:start position:0%
hampshire is relative to the various
 
05:56:15.910 --> 05:56:15.920 align:start position:0%
vaccines from school childhood vaccines
 
05:56:18.830 --> 05:56:18.840 align:start position:0%
to adult vaccines so that we can then
 
05:56:22.070 --> 05:56:22.080 align:start position:0%
identify not mandate but identify the
 
05:56:25.190 --> 05:56:25.200 align:start position:0%
status of the state in terms of its
 
05:56:25.200 --> 05:56:26.150 align:start position:0%
status of the state in terms of its
current

05:56:26.150 --> 05:56:26.160 align:start position:0%
current
 
05:56:28.230 --> 05:56:28.240 align:start position:0%
vaccination levels
 
05:56:29.750 --> 05:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
this is important for a variety of
 
05:56:32.788 --> 05:56:32.798 align:start position:0%
reasons i'll just use one example
 
05:56:34.708 --> 05:56:34.718 align:start position:0%
if we don't have that data and we don't
 
05:56:36.470 --> 05:56:36.480 align:start position:0%
know what kind of vaccinations are
 
05:56:38.628 --> 05:56:38.638 align:start position:0%
occurring in schools
 
05:56:40.548 --> 05:56:40.558 align:start position:0%
uh as you know there was a measles
 
05:56:43.270 --> 05:56:43.280 align:start position:0%
outbreak um but that could occur without
 
05:56:44.868 --> 05:56:44.878 align:start position:0%
even knowing about it
 
05:56:47.350 --> 05:56:47.360 align:start position:0%
mumps is one as well and i've personal
 
05:56:48.868 --> 05:56:48.878 align:start position:0%
experience with that
 
05:56:51.910 --> 05:56:51.920 align:start position:0%
uh that if we don't know
 
05:56:54.070 --> 05:56:54.080 align:start position:0%
what the vaccination levels are and
 
05:56:56.070 --> 05:56:56.080 align:start position:0%
mumps does occur
 
05:56:58.788 --> 05:56:58.798 align:start position:0%
it can occur and then bring it home
 
05:57:01.030 --> 05:57:01.040 align:start position:0%
and unbeknownst
 
05:57:03.510 --> 05:57:03.520 align:start position:0%
so we need to keep monitoring it uh the
 
05:57:05.830 --> 05:57:05.840 align:start position:0%
difficulty is it's not just the kids if
 
05:57:08.070 --> 05:57:08.080 align:start position:0%
you bring it home and adults get it
 
05:57:11.190 --> 05:57:11.200 align:start position:0%
and uh adults as you some people
 
05:57:13.990 --> 05:57:14.000 align:start position:0%
probably know adults that get mumps it's
 
05:57:16.548 --> 05:57:16.558 align:start position:0%
a can be very devastating
 
05:57:19.030 --> 05:57:19.040 align:start position:0%
and women and my mother i brought it
 
05:57:21.510 --> 05:57:21.520 align:start position:0%
home and my mother got the mumps she
 
05:57:23.590 --> 05:57:23.600 align:start position:0%
almost had to have a tracheostomy so she
 
05:57:24.868 --> 05:57:24.878 align:start position:0%
could breathe
 
05:57:27.830 --> 05:57:27.840 align:start position:0%
uh men if they get in an adulthood are
 
05:57:29.910 --> 05:57:29.920 align:start position:0%
frequently sterile
 
05:57:31.990 --> 05:57:32.000 align:start position:0%
as a consequence
 
05:57:33.990 --> 05:57:34.000 align:start position:0%
it's very important for us to know not
 
05:57:36.948 --> 05:57:36.958 align:start position:0%
just for the kids but for adults uh so
 
05:57:38.628 --> 05:57:38.638 align:start position:0%
the consequences
 
05:57:40.868 --> 05:57:40.878 align:start position:0%
of just it's it's a level
 
05:57:43.910 --> 05:57:43.920 align:start position:0%
of awareness that we can uh give
 
05:57:43.920 --> 05:57:44.788 align:start position:0%
of awareness that we can uh give
our

05:57:44.788 --> 05:57:44.798 align:start position:0%
our
 
05:57:46.628 --> 05:57:46.638 align:start position:0%
constituents in the states of new
 
05:57:48.230 --> 05:57:48.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire knowing that
 
05:57:48.240 --> 05:57:49.110 align:start position:0%
hampshire knowing that
what

05:57:49.110 --> 05:57:49.120 align:start position:0%
what
 
05:57:51.590 --> 05:57:51.600 align:start position:0%
how we stand relative to any particular
 
05:57:51.600 --> 05:57:53.510 align:start position:0%
how we stand relative to any particular
disease

05:57:53.510 --> 05:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
disease
 
05:57:58.070 --> 05:57:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:00.070 --> 05:58:00.080 align:start position:0%
yes uh representative gay
 
05:58:02.310 --> 05:58:02.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for thank you for granting and
 
05:58:04.708 --> 05:58:04.718 align:start position:0%
thank you for answering my question
 
05:58:04.718 --> 05:58:05.430 align:start position:0%
thank you for answering my question
i

05:58:05.430 --> 05:58:05.440 align:start position:0%
i
 
05:58:07.270 --> 05:58:07.280 align:start position:0%
understand about the measles and the
 
05:58:10.788 --> 05:58:10.798 align:start position:0%
monks but i'm not seeing what lines are
 
05:58:14.230 --> 05:58:14.240 align:start position:0%
pretending pertaining to those i'm just
 
05:58:16.788 --> 05:58:16.798 align:start position:0%
seeing on line six
 
05:58:21.750 --> 05:58:21.760 align:start position:0%
the mention of influenza and lines 24.
 
05:58:24.150 --> 05:58:24.160 align:start position:0%
yes that's i'm just using that as an
 
05:58:24.160 --> 05:58:26.310 align:start position:0%
yes that's i'm just using that as an
example

05:58:26.310 --> 05:58:26.320 align:start position:0%
example
 
05:58:27.750 --> 05:58:27.760 align:start position:0%
there's other
 
05:58:30.868 --> 05:58:30.878 align:start position:0%
this is for reporting purposes excuse me
 
05:58:32.788 --> 05:58:32.798 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
05:58:34.948 --> 05:58:34.958 align:start position:0%
it says hospital shall also initially
 
05:58:38.548 --> 05:58:38.558 align:start position:0%
identify track and report
 
05:58:40.070 --> 05:58:40.080 align:start position:0%
that doesn't mean other things aren't
 
05:58:42.628 --> 05:58:42.638 align:start position:0%
surveyed just like in lines four and
 
05:58:42.638 --> 05:58:43.670 align:start position:0%
surveyed just like in lines four and
five

05:58:43.670 --> 05:58:43.680 align:start position:0%
five
 
05:58:47.750 --> 05:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
uh those are right uh picc lines are are
 
05:58:50.390 --> 05:58:50.400 align:start position:0%
internal lines that had to be reported
 
05:58:50.400 --> 05:58:51.670 align:start position:0%
internal lines that had to be reported
um

05:58:51.670 --> 05:58:51.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:58:54.390 --> 05:58:54.400 align:start position:0%
now the the uh compliance level is about
 
05:58:57.110 --> 05:58:57.120 align:start position:0%
95 to 98 percent level
 
05:58:57.120 --> 05:58:57.990 align:start position:0%
95 to 98 percent level
so

05:58:57.990 --> 05:58:58.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:58:59.990 --> 05:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
no longer do the facilities that use
 
05:59:03.270 --> 05:59:03.280 align:start position:0%
those kinds of internal lines have to
 
05:59:04.948 --> 05:59:04.958 align:start position:0%
provide a report
 
05:59:07.110 --> 05:59:07.120 align:start position:0%
when the site is reviewed they're still
 
05:59:07.120 --> 05:59:08.628 align:start position:0%
when the site is reviewed they're still
reviewed

05:59:08.628 --> 05:59:08.638 align:start position:0%
reviewed
 
05:59:10.788 --> 05:59:10.798 align:start position:0%
but they don't have to report
 
05:59:11.910 --> 05:59:11.920 align:start position:0%
because they're
 
05:59:15.430 --> 05:59:15.440 align:start position:0%
working at a high level of compliance
 
05:59:17.270 --> 05:59:17.280 align:start position:0%
and the same way with other vaccines as
 
05:59:17.280 --> 05:59:19.030 align:start position:0%
and the same way with other vaccines as
well

05:59:19.030 --> 05:59:19.040 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:59:19.040 --> 05:59:19.990 align:start position:0%
well
so

05:59:19.990 --> 05:59:20.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:59:24.150 --> 05:59:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:26.390 --> 05:59:26.400 align:start position:0%
representative weber
 
05:59:28.628 --> 05:59:28.638 align:start position:0%
and just going back to circling around
 
05:59:30.948 --> 05:59:30.958 align:start position:0%
to the very beginning on this am i not
 
05:59:32.230 --> 05:59:32.240 align:start position:0%
correct that the
 
05:59:36.230 --> 05:59:36.240 align:start position:0%
the big thrust of this bill was to
 
05:59:39.910 --> 05:59:39.920 align:start position:0%
relieve hospitals of having to report
 
05:59:43.510 --> 05:59:43.520 align:start position:0%
uh information that we all agree
 
05:59:47.830 --> 05:59:47.840 align:start position:0%
is not necessary anymore because the um
 
05:59:49.270 --> 05:59:49.280 align:start position:0%
things that they're reporting are such
 
05:59:52.548 --> 05:59:52.558 align:start position:0%
standard procedure that we just it's
 
05:59:55.030 --> 05:59:55.040 align:start position:0%
um counterproductive for them to have to
 
05:59:57.270 --> 05:59:57.280 align:start position:0%
assemble the information and send it in
 
05:59:59.430 --> 05:59:59.440 align:start position:0%
regularly is that correct yes that's
 
06:00:00.788 --> 06:00:00.798 align:start position:0%
correct that's what i mean they were at
 
06:00:02.948 --> 06:00:02.958 align:start position:0%
such a compliance that they no longer
 
06:00:05.670 --> 06:00:05.680 align:start position:0%
have to they're still have to perform
 
06:00:08.868 --> 06:00:08.878 align:start position:0%
that and they're reviewed on that
 
06:00:11.670 --> 06:00:11.680 align:start position:0%
but this relieves them from the uh
 
06:00:20.390 --> 06:00:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:23.990 --> 06:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:25.750 --> 06:00:25.760 align:start position:0%
representative snow
 
06:00:25.760 --> 06:00:26.628 align:start position:0%
representative snow
yes

06:00:26.628 --> 06:00:26.638 align:start position:0%
yes
 
06:00:27.910 --> 06:00:27.920 align:start position:0%
probably i'm the only one that doesn't
 
06:00:30.230 --> 06:00:30.240 align:start position:0%
understand this but i see no mention in
 
06:00:33.270 --> 06:00:33.280 align:start position:0%
this bill of covid 19 vaccination is
 
06:00:35.110 --> 06:00:35.120 align:start position:0%
that just assumed that that would also
 
06:00:35.120 --> 06:00:35.830 align:start position:0%
that just assumed that that would also
be

06:00:35.830 --> 06:00:35.840 align:start position:0%
be
 
06:00:35.840 --> 06:00:37.350 align:start position:0%
be
tracked

06:00:37.350 --> 06:00:37.360 align:start position:0%
tracked
 
06:00:39.910 --> 06:00:39.920 align:start position:0%
um i can't
 
06:00:42.628 --> 06:00:42.638 align:start position:0%
excuse me i can't say that that's nearly
 
06:00:44.310 --> 06:00:44.320 align:start position:0%
tracked under a different
 
06:00:48.948 --> 06:00:48.958 align:start position:0%
uh guy's um and uh representative marsh
 
06:00:50.788 --> 06:00:50.798 align:start position:0%
yes i'd like to answer the question that
 
06:00:53.110 --> 06:00:53.120 align:start position:0%
this bill is aimed at the national
 
06:00:55.430 --> 06:00:55.440 align:start position:0%
quality uh improvement initiative
 
06:00:55.440 --> 06:00:56.628 align:start position:0%
quality uh improvement initiative
hospitals

06:00:56.628 --> 06:00:56.638 align:start position:0%
hospitals
 
06:01:09.910 --> 06:01:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:13.110 --> 06:01:13.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:15.270 --> 06:01:15.280 align:start position:0%
representative cushman thank you mr
 
06:01:16.948 --> 06:01:16.958 align:start position:0%
chairman so i'm just going to make
 
06:01:18.948 --> 06:01:18.958 align:start position:0%
comments that i had made the last time
 
06:01:20.788 --> 06:01:20.798 align:start position:0%
we talked about this bill
 
06:01:22.868 --> 06:01:22.878 align:start position:0%
um that i believe that this term
 
06:01:24.548 --> 06:01:24.558 align:start position:0%
measures is
 
06:01:28.548 --> 06:01:28.558 align:start position:0%
um to allow tracking and reporting um
 
06:01:28.558 --> 06:01:30.708 align:start position:0%
um to allow tracking and reporting um
including

06:01:30.708 --> 06:01:30.718 align:start position:0%
including
 
06:01:32.708 --> 06:01:32.718 align:start position:0%
other vaccinations in healthcare
 
06:01:35.510 --> 06:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
personnel patients and residents
 
06:01:38.708 --> 06:01:38.718 align:start position:0%
in healthcare facilities this measures
 
06:01:40.788 --> 06:01:40.798 align:start position:0%
language is new and
 
06:01:42.470 --> 06:01:42.480 align:start position:0%
it's intended to
 
06:01:44.470 --> 06:01:44.480 align:start position:0%
include vaccinations as an infection
 
06:01:46.150 --> 06:01:46.160 align:start position:0%
control measure
 
06:01:49.190 --> 06:01:49.200 align:start position:0%
um and i don't agree with doing this it
 
06:01:50.868 --> 06:01:50.878 align:start position:0%
opens the door to
 
06:01:53.350 --> 06:01:53.360 align:start position:0%
um pressure coming from
 
06:01:55.030 --> 06:01:55.040 align:start position:0%
the the
 
06:01:57.030 --> 06:01:57.040 align:start position:0%
from the top of the hierarchy in these
 
06:01:59.430 --> 06:01:59.440 align:start position:0%
facilities all the way down because now
 
06:02:01.270 --> 06:02:01.280 align:start position:0%
we're tracking now we're going to make
 
06:02:04.788 --> 06:02:04.798 align:start position:0%
it happen and your argument that
 
06:02:07.750 --> 06:02:07.760 align:start position:0%
we do away with reporting pick lines
 
06:02:08.948 --> 06:02:08.958 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
06:02:12.070 --> 06:02:12.080 align:start position:0%
bolsters that thought for me that
 
06:02:14.708 --> 06:02:14.718 align:start position:0%
you know this is to
 
06:02:14.718 --> 06:02:16.470 align:start position:0%
you know this is to
increase

06:02:16.470 --> 06:02:16.480 align:start position:0%
increase
 
06:02:18.708 --> 06:02:18.718 align:start position:0%
whatever they're measuring
 
06:02:21.430 --> 06:02:21.440 align:start position:0%
until they have compliance and no longer
 
06:02:23.990 --> 06:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
have to measure it anymore
 
06:02:24.000 --> 06:02:24.788 align:start position:0%
have to measure it anymore
um

06:02:24.788 --> 06:02:24.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:02:27.590 --> 06:02:27.600 align:start position:0%
i don't see a demonstrated need for
 
06:02:30.150 --> 06:02:30.160 align:start position:0%
such such broad language
 
06:02:31.510 --> 06:02:31.520 align:start position:0%
and i
 
06:02:31.520 --> 06:02:32.470 align:start position:0%
and i
i

06:02:32.470 --> 06:02:32.480 align:start position:0%
i
 
06:02:35.190 --> 06:02:35.200 align:start position:0%
i don't i haven't heard of any
 
06:02:37.750 --> 06:02:37.760 align:start position:0%
healthcare associated communicable
 
06:02:40.310 --> 06:02:40.320 align:start position:0%
disease outbreaks that weren't this
 
06:02:42.470 --> 06:02:42.480 align:start position:0%
tracking and i i
 
06:02:46.310 --> 06:02:46.320 align:start position:0%
wanted a an amendment to make it clear
 
06:02:49.110 --> 06:02:49.120 align:start position:0%
that this these reporting and tracking
 
06:02:50.390 --> 06:02:50.400 align:start position:0%
of measures
 
06:02:53.750 --> 06:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
does not include anything but uh vax any
 
06:02:56.310 --> 06:02:56.320 align:start position:0%
vaccinations but those explicitly
 
06:02:58.470 --> 06:02:58.480 align:start position:0%
outlined in this statute
 
06:02:58.480 --> 06:02:59.430 align:start position:0%
outlined in this statute
um

06:02:59.430 --> 06:02:59.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:03:01.510 --> 06:03:01.520 align:start position:0%
but we didn't come to that agreement and
 
06:03:03.750 --> 06:03:03.760 align:start position:0%
that is all thank you
 
06:03:05.110 --> 06:03:05.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:03:07.350 --> 06:03:07.360 align:start position:0%
thank you um um
 
06:03:09.750 --> 06:03:09.760 align:start position:0%
that's one interpretation for the use of
 
06:03:11.750 --> 06:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
measures but um
 
06:03:15.350 --> 06:03:15.360 align:start position:0%
a dhhs is i think uh listening in
 
06:03:17.830 --> 06:03:17.840 align:start position:0%
and they might be able to provide for
 
06:03:20.948 --> 06:03:20.958 align:start position:0%
information purposes a very explicit
 
06:03:22.868 --> 06:03:22.878 align:start position:0%
detailed uh
 
06:03:24.628 --> 06:03:24.638 align:start position:0%
concept of exactly
 
06:03:27.270 --> 06:03:27.280 align:start position:0%
what the term measures means
 
06:03:30.948 --> 06:03:30.958 align:start position:0%
and uh um it's its implementation
 
06:03:34.628 --> 06:03:34.638 align:start position:0%
um and that may clarify that
 
06:03:34.638 --> 06:03:35.430 align:start position:0%
um and that may clarify that
and

06:03:35.430 --> 06:03:35.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:03:38.868 --> 06:03:38.878 align:start position:0%
i apologize to katrina because
 
06:03:41.270 --> 06:03:41.280 align:start position:0%
our schedule went way wacky off of what
 
06:03:43.910 --> 06:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
i had promised her so i hope she's
 
06:03:46.070 --> 06:03:46.080 align:start position:0%
not given up on us but if there is
 
06:03:48.708 --> 06:03:48.718 align:start position:0%
somebody from dhhs we occasionally in an
 
06:03:51.190 --> 06:03:51.200 align:start position:0%
exact session calling an expert witness
 
06:03:54.190 --> 06:03:54.200 align:start position:0%
for clarification is there someone from
 
06:03:57.990 --> 06:03:58.000 align:start position:0%
dhhs abby rogers or katrina or john
 
06:03:59.990 --> 06:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
williams or somebody who could address
 
06:04:03.110 --> 06:04:03.120 align:start position:0%
that question
 
06:04:03.120 --> 06:04:03.910 align:start position:0%
that question
um

06:04:03.910 --> 06:04:03.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:04:05.910 --> 06:04:05.920 align:start position:0%
katrina katrina was going to be
 
06:04:07.190 --> 06:04:07.200 align:start position:0%
listening in but
 
06:04:12.548 --> 06:04:12.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:18.780 --> 06:04:18.790 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:18.790 --> 06:04:20.708 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

06:04:20.708 --> 06:04:20.718 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:04:20.718 --> 06:04:21.590 align:start position:0%
[Music]
okay

06:04:21.590 --> 06:04:21.600 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:04:38.868 --> 06:04:38.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:40.788 --> 06:04:40.798 align:start position:0%
hello everyone my name is katrina hanson
 
06:04:42.070 --> 06:04:42.080 align:start position:0%
can you please hear me or can you hear
 
06:04:43.990 --> 06:04:44.000 align:start position:0%
me members of the community again
 
06:04:47.350 --> 06:04:47.360 align:start position:0%
apologies for the time going all wacky
 
06:04:49.350 --> 06:04:49.360 align:start position:0%
i appreciate it thank you no it's okay
 
06:04:52.390 --> 06:04:52.400 align:start position:0%
um i was able to um coordinate and um
 
06:04:54.230 --> 06:04:54.240 align:start position:0%
work with abby rogers to sign off and
 
06:04:56.868 --> 06:04:56.878 align:start position:0%
back on so also thank her
 
06:04:58.708 --> 06:04:58.718 align:start position:0%
um so yes thank you for your question
 
06:05:00.788 --> 06:05:00.798 align:start position:0%
representative cushman and others um
 
06:05:03.830 --> 06:05:03.840 align:start position:0%
this term measures is to allow us to
 
06:05:06.470 --> 06:05:06.480 align:start position:0%
provide um kind of
 
06:05:09.510 --> 06:05:09.520 align:start position:0%
near real-time changes if we needed to
 
06:05:10.868 --> 06:05:10.878 align:start position:0%
but we'd have to go through our whole
 
06:05:12.548 --> 06:05:12.558 align:start position:0%
administrative rules process so i do
 
06:05:14.390 --> 06:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
want to clarify if there is a change to
 
06:05:17.510 --> 06:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
any process or outcome measures for
 
06:05:19.430 --> 06:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
hai reporting or healthcare associated
 
06:05:20.868 --> 06:05:20.878 align:start position:0%
infections we'd still have to go through
 
06:05:23.430 --> 06:05:23.440 align:start position:0%
an administrative rules process
 
06:05:26.628 --> 06:05:26.638 align:start position:0%
in regards to the the question about
 
06:05:26.638 --> 06:05:27.910 align:start position:0%
in regards to the the question about
vaccine

06:05:27.910 --> 06:05:27.920 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
06:05:29.990 --> 06:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
and healthcare personnel flu influenza
 
06:05:31.590 --> 06:05:31.600 align:start position:0%
vaccination tracking
 
06:05:33.510 --> 06:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
currently and what we continue to do and
 
06:05:35.350 --> 06:05:35.360 align:start position:0%
what we plan to continue to do is to
 
06:05:37.190 --> 06:05:37.200 align:start position:0%
continue to track it
 
06:05:39.350 --> 06:05:39.360 align:start position:0%
by healthcare setting
 
06:05:41.510 --> 06:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
including hospitals long-term care
 
06:05:43.750 --> 06:05:43.760 align:start position:0%
facilities and other facilities
 
06:05:46.230 --> 06:05:46.240 align:start position:0%
for health care workers and residents or
 
06:05:46.240 --> 06:05:47.670 align:start position:0%
for health care workers and residents or
patients

06:05:47.670 --> 06:05:47.680 align:start position:0%
patients
 
06:05:49.670 --> 06:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
we use this information and can be very
 
06:05:51.350 --> 06:05:51.360 align:start position:0%
valuable because we do see a range of
 
06:05:53.430 --> 06:05:53.440 align:start position:0%
experience we do see
 
06:05:55.510 --> 06:05:55.520 align:start position:0%
outbreaks of influenza
 
06:05:57.590 --> 06:05:57.600 align:start position:0%
during typical influenza seasons
 
06:06:00.230 --> 06:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
primarily impacted or primarily at
 
06:06:01.510 --> 06:06:01.520 align:start position:0%
facilities that may have lower
 
06:06:01.520 --> 06:06:02.708 align:start position:0%
facilities that may have lower
vaccination

06:06:02.708 --> 06:06:02.718 align:start position:0%
vaccination
 
06:06:04.788 --> 06:06:04.798 align:start position:0%
rates among health care workers so at
 
06:06:06.470 --> 06:06:06.480 align:start position:0%
times that can be very helpful for us to
 
06:06:07.830 --> 06:06:07.840 align:start position:0%
understand and be able to provide
 
06:06:09.350 --> 06:06:09.360 align:start position:0%
recommendations and guidance to those
 
06:06:11.190 --> 06:06:11.200 align:start position:0%
health care facilities
 
06:06:13.030 --> 06:06:13.040 align:start position:0%
what we have seen is health hospital
 
06:06:14.470 --> 06:06:14.480 align:start position:0%
settings tend to have
 
06:06:16.390 --> 06:06:16.400 align:start position:0%
they've had high
 
06:06:18.150 --> 06:06:18.160 align:start position:0%
rates um since we've been tracking the
 
06:06:18.160 --> 06:06:19.110 align:start position:0%
rates um since we've been tracking the
data

06:06:19.110 --> 06:06:19.120 align:start position:0%
data
 
06:06:20.868 --> 06:06:20.878 align:start position:0%
more recently but in the very beginning
 
06:06:22.310 --> 06:06:22.320 align:start position:0%
it was actually lower and has changed
 
06:06:24.470 --> 06:06:24.480 align:start position:0%
over time
 
06:06:26.150 --> 06:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
we continue to see
 
06:06:28.788 --> 06:06:28.798 align:start position:0%
lower vaccination within healthcare
 
06:06:31.190 --> 06:06:31.200 align:start position:0%
personnel in populations in other
 
06:06:32.788 --> 06:06:32.798 align:start position:0%
settings such as in long-term care
 
06:06:34.390 --> 06:06:34.400 align:start position:0%
assisted living nursing homes so i do
 
06:06:36.708 --> 06:06:36.718 align:start position:0%
want to mention that
 
06:06:38.708 --> 06:06:38.718 align:start position:0%
for other process measures
 
06:06:39.910 --> 06:06:39.920 align:start position:0%
right now
 
06:06:42.070 --> 06:06:42.080 align:start position:0%
we don't plan to add any process
 
06:06:46.470 --> 06:06:46.480 align:start position:0%
measures but we may have a need at in if
 
06:06:48.310 --> 06:06:48.320 align:start position:0%
if there is a change
 
06:06:50.788 --> 06:06:50.798 align:start position:0%
or new antibiotic-resistant organism for
 
06:06:52.230 --> 06:06:52.240 align:start position:0%
example so
 
06:06:53.990 --> 06:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
right now we are tracking certain
 
06:06:56.230 --> 06:06:56.240 align:start position:0%
measures and you can see that here but
 
06:06:57.990 --> 06:06:58.000 align:start position:0%
it's very possible we may see a new
 
06:07:00.150 --> 06:07:00.160 align:start position:0%
antibiotic-resistant organism or as
 
06:07:02.390 --> 06:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
often called a superbug and we need to
 
06:07:04.708 --> 06:07:04.718 align:start position:0%
adapt modify our administrative rules to
 
06:07:06.868 --> 06:07:06.878 align:start position:0%
be able to track those within the
 
06:07:08.628 --> 06:07:08.638 align:start position:0%
surveillance system that is available
 
06:07:10.708 --> 06:07:10.718 align:start position:0%
for healthcare associated infections so
 
06:07:13.350 --> 06:07:13.360 align:start position:0%
that's why the term measures is there um
 
06:07:15.190 --> 06:07:15.200 align:start position:0%
and i hope i address the questions
 
06:07:19.670 --> 06:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:21.350 --> 06:07:21.360 align:start position:0%
but i'm willing to answer any other
 
06:07:23.430 --> 06:07:23.440 align:start position:0%
questions or
 
06:07:26.390 --> 06:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:29.910 --> 06:07:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:32.470 --> 06:07:32.480 align:start position:0%
no hands thank you so much
 
06:07:35.830 --> 06:07:35.840 align:start position:0%
you're welcome thank you for having me

moved by representative woods
 
06:08:00.548 --> 06:08:00.558 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative marsh would

yes thank you

06:11:32.948 --> 06:11:32.958 align:start position:0%

to your amendment
 
06:11:36.708 --> 06:11:36.718 align:start position:0%
yes thank you as you recall this was a
 
06:11:39.110 --> 06:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
bit of a house omnibus bill
 
06:11:41.510 --> 06:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh wrapping up a whole bunch of bills
 
06:11:43.670 --> 06:11:43.680 align:start position:0%
that went through last year uh through
 
06:11:45.830 --> 06:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
the house but never got through the
 
06:11:47.750 --> 06:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
cove pandemic
 
06:11:49.830 --> 06:11:49.840 align:start position:0%
um but it had a lot of redundancy with
 
06:11:51.830 --> 06:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
other uh issues that we have either
 
06:11:55.430 --> 06:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
already passed or um we're moving ahead
 
06:11:57.350 --> 06:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
on or in other ways
 
06:12:00.310 --> 06:12:00.320 align:start position:0%
so for example insomnia we already
 
06:12:02.868 --> 06:12:02.878 align:start position:0%
passed out as a as hb 89
 
06:12:04.868 --> 06:12:04.878 align:start position:0%
uh the information about pregnancy we
 
06:12:07.190 --> 06:12:07.200 align:start position:0%
passed a much more robust bill uh with
 
06:12:09.590 --> 06:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
163 repealing the therapeutic cannabis
 
06:12:11.350 --> 06:12:11.360 align:start position:0%
advisory council we already passed that
 
06:12:14.708 --> 06:12:14.718 align:start position:0%
out um so what we ended up doing was
 
06:12:16.788 --> 06:12:16.798 align:start position:0%
basically getting rid of a lot oh sorry
 
06:12:19.430 --> 06:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
and the first two sections as enumerated
 
06:12:23.910 --> 06:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
on the analysis are already in sb 162
 
06:12:26.310 --> 06:12:26.320 align:start position:0%
they're requested by dhhs and so that's
 
06:12:28.150 --> 06:12:28.160 align:start position:0%
already running through the senate so to
 
06:12:30.390 --> 06:12:30.400 align:start position:0%
tidy this up and make it a lot less
 
06:12:30.400 --> 06:12:31.670 align:start position:0%
tidy this up and make it a lot less
cumbersome

06:12:31.670 --> 06:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
cumbersome
 
06:12:33.590 --> 06:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
we basically cut it down to being just
 
06:12:37.990 --> 06:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
the issue about um a redefinition of
 
06:12:39.590 --> 06:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
in the very first section if you look in
 
06:12:41.910 --> 06:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
lines five through eight just simply
 
06:12:44.868 --> 06:12:44.878 align:start position:0%
adding that issue about um
 
06:12:46.868 --> 06:12:46.878 align:start position:0%
the designated caregivers and visiting
 
06:12:49.350 --> 06:12:49.360 align:start position:0%
qualifying patients um
 
06:12:51.110 --> 06:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
then we have the issue about cannabis
 
06:12:53.350 --> 06:12:53.360 align:start position:0%
for therapeutic purposes
 
06:12:55.670 --> 06:12:55.680 align:start position:0%
uh that is sections 9
 
06:12:59.030 --> 06:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
through 17. and that is with the
 
06:13:01.430 --> 06:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
rather rigid stipulations from the
 
06:13:03.110 --> 06:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis medical oversight
 
06:13:05.510 --> 06:13:05.520 align:start position:0%
board and the remaining portion of it
 
06:13:08.868 --> 06:13:08.878 align:start position:0%
just tidies up some issues about
 
06:13:12.070 --> 06:13:12.080 align:start position:0%
out-of-state residents being able to
 
06:13:12.080 --> 06:13:14.310 align:start position:0%
out-of-state residents being able to
access

06:13:14.310 --> 06:13:14.320 align:start position:0%
access
 
06:13:17.670 --> 06:13:17.680 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis at one of our
 
06:13:17.680 --> 06:13:19.190 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis at one of our
atc's

06:13:19.190 --> 06:13:19.200 align:start position:0%
atc's
 
06:13:22.470 --> 06:13:22.480 align:start position:0%
now just to go back though to make this
 
06:13:24.310 --> 06:13:24.320 align:start position:0%
just a little bit clearer i do still
 
06:13:25.910 --> 06:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
want to report
 
06:13:27.830 --> 06:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
that the therapeutic cannabis medical
 
06:13:31.190 --> 06:13:31.200 align:start position:0%
oversight board did not vote
 
06:13:33.270 --> 06:13:33.280 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly for adding opioid use
 
06:13:34.548 --> 06:13:34.558 align:start position:0%
disorder many of the other things you
 
06:13:36.628 --> 06:13:36.638 align:start position:0%
heard me speak about we did vote like
 
06:13:38.788 --> 06:13:38.798 align:start position:0%
you know nine to zero or eight to one or
 
06:13:41.750 --> 06:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
whatever we were split on this
 
06:13:44.390 --> 06:13:44.400 align:start position:0%
um and we did not go back to revisit it
 
06:13:46.708 --> 06:13:46.718 align:start position:0%
we'd had a few absences that day
 
06:13:50.628 --> 06:13:50.638 align:start position:0%
and the vote ended up being four to six
 
06:13:52.788 --> 06:13:52.798 align:start position:0%
i.e it failed when we talked about
 
06:13:55.030 --> 06:13:55.040 align:start position:0%
whether we should add oud and that is
 
06:13:56.070 --> 06:13:56.080 align:start position:0%
because of some of the unique
 
06:13:58.868 --> 06:13:58.878 align:start position:0%
considerations but likewise because we
 
06:14:00.868 --> 06:14:00.878 align:start position:0%
did recognize that
 
06:14:05.190 --> 06:14:05.200 align:start position:0%
the um this is in 2019 retained bill
 
06:14:07.590 --> 06:14:07.600 align:start position:0%
that the house may not follow that
 
06:14:09.350 --> 06:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
recommendation because we were rather
 
06:14:09.360 --> 06:14:10.230 align:start position:0%
recommendation because we were rather
split

06:14:10.230 --> 06:14:10.240 align:start position:0%
split
 
06:14:12.390 --> 06:14:12.400 align:start position:0%
we did work very hard to come up with a
 
06:14:14.150 --> 06:14:14.160 align:start position:0%
number of restrictions so that if it did
 
06:14:16.948 --> 06:14:16.958 align:start position:0%
pass it could be acceptable and indeed
 
06:14:19.190 --> 06:14:19.200 align:start position:0%
even after
 
06:14:21.910 --> 06:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
we uh
 
06:14:25.110 --> 06:14:25.120 align:start position:0%
even after this uh was passed through as
 
06:14:27.990 --> 06:14:28.000 align:start position:0%
uh 366 last uh
 
06:14:30.628 --> 06:14:30.638 align:start position:0%
well it was a 2019 bill that got acted
 
06:14:32.628 --> 06:14:32.638 align:start position:0%
on at 20. um
 
06:14:34.628 --> 06:14:34.638 align:start position:0%
we even went back and just made sure to
 
06:14:36.310 --> 06:14:36.320 align:start position:0%
tidy up the language to add that issue
 
06:14:38.628 --> 06:14:38.638 align:start position:0%
about for the individual patient for the
 
06:14:40.788 --> 06:14:40.798 align:start position:0%
person doing medication assisted
 
06:14:42.310 --> 06:14:42.320 align:start position:0%
treatment so
 
06:14:44.548 --> 06:14:44.558 align:start position:0%
it's not like the therapeutic cannabis
 
06:14:46.150 --> 06:14:46.160 align:start position:0%
medical advisory board thought this was
 
06:14:48.788 --> 06:14:48.798 align:start position:0%
a ghastly idea and should never be done
 
06:14:50.390 --> 06:14:50.400 align:start position:0%
but they did not give it any kind of
 
06:14:52.868 --> 06:14:52.878 align:start position:0%
overwhelming support by any means i
 
06:14:54.310 --> 06:14:54.320 align:start position:0%
think it was the type of thing with this
 
06:14:56.150 --> 06:14:56.160 align:start position:0%
that if we're going to do it
 
06:14:58.628 --> 06:14:58.638 align:start position:0%
put all these restrictions in so that it
 
06:14:58.638 --> 06:14:59.350 align:start position:0%
put all these restrictions in so that it
is

06:14:59.350 --> 06:14:59.360 align:start position:0%
is
 
06:15:02.310 --> 06:15:02.320 align:start position:0%
a high bar for a person to get to so
 
06:15:04.868 --> 06:15:04.878 align:start position:0%
we're sure that people aren't giving uh
 
06:15:07.990 --> 06:15:08.000 align:start position:0%
people with oud a bunch of thc which
 
06:15:09.910 --> 06:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
would be counterproductive but instead
 
06:15:11.270 --> 06:15:11.280 align:start position:0%
would know that they want to be going
 
06:15:13.750 --> 06:15:13.760 align:start position:0%
with primarily cbd which does have good
 
06:15:15.590 --> 06:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
evidence that it can be helpful
 
06:15:17.590 --> 06:15:17.600 align:start position:0%
so that was the part that is actually
 
06:15:20.948 --> 06:15:20.958 align:start position:0%
controversial about this bill um
 
06:15:22.390 --> 06:15:22.400 align:start position:0%
but again we did pass it through the
 
06:15:24.548 --> 06:15:24.558 align:start position:0%
house last year because we felt it would
 
06:15:26.708 --> 06:15:26.718 align:start position:0%
be a reasonable addition with the
 
06:15:30.788 --> 06:15:30.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:32.788 --> 06:15:32.798 align:start position:0%
representative marsh
 
06:15:35.430 --> 06:15:35.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i
 
06:15:37.270 --> 06:15:37.280 align:start position:0%
unfortunately cannot support this
 
06:15:39.110 --> 06:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
amendment for two reasons
 
06:15:41.830 --> 06:15:41.840 align:start position:0%
first of all as representative testified
 
06:15:43.590 --> 06:15:43.600 align:start position:0%
to us the uh
 
06:15:45.430 --> 06:15:45.440 align:start position:0%
scientific evidence on the use of
 
06:15:47.750 --> 06:15:47.760 align:start position:0%
cannabis for opiate
 
06:15:51.110 --> 06:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
use disorder is at best equipable and
 
06:15:53.910 --> 06:15:53.920 align:start position:0%
at least six members of the advisory
 
06:15:55.910 --> 06:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
panel did not recommend adding that
 
06:15:57.670 --> 06:15:57.680 align:start position:0%
indication at this time
 
06:15:59.750 --> 06:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
um the second reason is that the
 
06:16:02.548 --> 06:16:02.558 align:start position:0%
language about people from other states
 
06:16:05.030 --> 06:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
and countries being able to access our
 
06:16:07.350 --> 06:16:07.360 align:start position:0%
alternative care centers i think is
 
06:16:09.910 --> 06:16:09.920 align:start position:0%
somewhat problematic i i could see
 
06:16:12.390 --> 06:16:12.400 align:start position:0%
language that would allow other states i
 
06:16:14.548 --> 06:16:14.558 align:start position:0%
could even see language that are not in
 
06:16:16.628 --> 06:16:16.638 align:start position:0%
canada accessing our alternative
 
06:16:18.548 --> 06:16:18.558 align:start position:0%
treatment centers but the current
 
06:16:20.390 --> 06:16:20.400 align:start position:0%
language that about anyone from any
 
06:16:22.708 --> 06:16:22.718 align:start position:0%
country anywhere in the world
 
06:16:25.030 --> 06:16:25.040 align:start position:0%
someone with laws are
 
06:16:28.310 --> 06:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
at best obscure uh and and i think that
 
06:16:30.230 --> 06:16:30.240 align:start position:0%
that's too broad and i cannot support it
 
06:16:33.590 --> 06:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
so i will be voting against this man
 
06:16:34.948 --> 06:16:34.958 align:start position:0%
may i respond
 
06:16:36.628 --> 06:16:36.638 align:start position:0%
you may respond
 
06:16:38.708 --> 06:16:38.718 align:start position:0%
okay uh well it's not anybody from
 
06:16:41.190 --> 06:16:41.200 align:start position:0%
anywhere can access it's only a person
 
06:16:44.310 --> 06:16:44.320 align:start position:0%
who is does have a valid uh registration
 
06:16:46.628 --> 06:16:46.638 align:start position:0%
card or it's equivalent and part of this
 
06:16:48.150 --> 06:16:48.160 align:start position:0%
is to take care of the situation where
 
06:16:50.708 --> 06:16:50.718 align:start position:0%
we may have out of state students who
 
06:16:52.788 --> 06:16:52.798 align:start position:0%
are in our state or other people who are
 
06:16:54.788 --> 06:16:54.798 align:start position:0%
milit uh well probably not military but
 
06:16:56.070 --> 06:16:56.080 align:start position:0%
other people who may be stationed here
 
06:16:57.270 --> 06:16:57.280 align:start position:0%
for a job
 
06:16:59.270 --> 06:16:59.280 align:start position:0%
and are a therapeutic cannabis patient
 
06:17:01.430 --> 06:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
let's say in maine
 
06:17:02.788 --> 06:17:02.798 align:start position:0%
they would have the choice of either
 
06:17:03.910 --> 06:17:03.920 align:start position:0%
purchasing in maine and then
 
06:17:06.070 --> 06:17:06.080 align:start position:0%
transporting across a state line which
 
06:17:07.430 --> 06:17:07.440 align:start position:0%
is illegal
 
06:17:10.708 --> 06:17:10.718 align:start position:0%
or to be able to purchase here which
 
06:17:12.390 --> 06:17:12.400 align:start position:0%
we thought would be a preferable way to
 
06:17:13.670 --> 06:17:13.680 align:start position:0%
handle that
 
06:17:14.948 --> 06:17:14.958 align:start position:0%
as long as they have a valid
 
06:17:16.548 --> 06:17:16.558 align:start position:0%
registration card
 
06:17:19.190 --> 06:17:19.200 align:start position:0%
i really don't think we have many other
 
06:17:21.270 --> 06:17:21.280 align:start position:0%
countries that are doing this because
 
06:17:23.270 --> 06:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
that's not the situation
 
06:17:25.270 --> 06:17:25.280 align:start position:0%
i can appreciate your concern about that
 
06:17:27.430 --> 06:17:27.440 align:start position:0%
and michael may be on this
 
06:17:29.430 --> 06:17:29.440 align:start position:0%
i didn't check to see and he may have a
 
06:17:32.390 --> 06:17:32.400 align:start position:0%
reason why the department requested
 
06:17:35.110 --> 06:17:35.120 align:start position:0%
that that piece would be in there
 
06:17:37.350 --> 06:17:37.360 align:start position:0%
i do not see him on the attendee list
 
06:17:37.360 --> 06:17:42.788 align:start position:0%
i do not see him on the attendee list
though

06:17:42.788 --> 06:17:42.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:44.548 --> 06:17:44.558 align:start position:0%
thank you representative i didn't say
 
06:17:46.868 --> 06:17:46.878 align:start position:0%
that i was opposed to the idea i said i
 
06:17:52.628 --> 06:17:52.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:54.310 --> 06:17:54.320 align:start position:0%
got it
 
06:18:00.390 --> 06:18:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:03.190 --> 06:18:03.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i think that
 
06:18:06.470 --> 06:18:06.480 align:start position:0%
looking at the amendment um
 
06:18:09.110 --> 06:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
i understand representative marsha's
 
06:18:12.070 --> 06:18:12.080 align:start position:0%
concerns but i have to say that i think
 
06:18:14.070 --> 06:18:14.080 align:start position:0%
under the very
 
06:18:14.080 --> 06:18:17.110 align:start position:0%
under the very
um

06:18:17.110 --> 06:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:17.120 --> 06:18:18.628 align:start position:0%
 
limited

06:18:18.628 --> 06:18:18.638 align:start position:0%
limited
 
06:18:18.638 --> 06:18:20.430 align:start position:0%
limited
uh

06:18:20.430 --> 06:18:20.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:18:23.190 --> 06:18:23.200 align:start position:0%
circumstances under which opioid use
 
06:18:26.310 --> 06:18:26.320 align:start position:0%
disorder can be addressed
 
06:18:26.320 --> 06:18:27.430 align:start position:0%
disorder can be addressed
um

06:18:27.430 --> 06:18:27.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:18:27.440 --> 06:18:28.948 align:start position:0%
um
and

06:18:28.948 --> 06:18:28.958 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:18:33.430 --> 06:18:33.440 align:start position:0%
i i i'm i'm okay going with that um
 
06:18:36.948 --> 06:18:36.958 align:start position:0%
and then the other thing is um with
 
06:18:39.430 --> 06:18:39.440 align:start position:0%
respect to say a foreign national who
 
06:18:39.440 --> 06:18:40.470 align:start position:0%
respect to say a foreign national who
comes

06:18:40.470 --> 06:18:40.480 align:start position:0%
comes
 
06:18:42.230 --> 06:18:42.240 align:start position:0%
you know there was a time when we had a
 
06:18:45.430 --> 06:18:45.440 align:start position:0%
really vibrant
 
06:18:47.670 --> 06:18:47.680 align:start position:0%
tourist industry in this state and i
 
06:18:50.470 --> 06:18:50.480 align:start position:0%
hope to have one again actually i think
 
06:18:51.990 --> 06:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
it's going to be pretty vibrant this
 
06:18:55.430 --> 06:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
year but it'll just be from local places
 
06:18:58.628 --> 06:18:58.638 align:start position:0%
rather than farther afield but i think
 
06:19:04.070 --> 06:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:06.230 --> 06:19:06.240 align:start position:0%
for something that has
 
06:19:08.948 --> 06:19:08.958 align:start position:0%
turned out to be
 
06:19:11.510 --> 06:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
very helpful for a great number of
 
06:19:13.910 --> 06:19:13.920 align:start position:0%
citizens and has allowed them
 
06:19:16.628 --> 06:19:16.638 align:start position:0%
to enhance the quality of their lives
 
06:19:18.310 --> 06:19:18.320 align:start position:0%
rather than diminish the quality of
 
06:19:22.390 --> 06:19:22.400 align:start position:0%
their lives um i'm i'm going to vote in
 
06:19:25.430 --> 06:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
of the amendment um and then in favor of
 
06:19:27.430 --> 06:19:27.440 align:start position:0%
the bill i think the amendment enhances
 
06:19:29.030 --> 06:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
the bill because we don't want to have
 
06:19:30.230 --> 06:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
all those other
 
06:19:32.150 --> 06:19:32.160 align:start position:0%
pieces of the bill running around and i
 
06:19:34.548 --> 06:19:34.558 align:start position:0%
think that as drafted
 
06:19:37.910 --> 06:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
i'm i can support this and uh appreciate
 
06:19:40.788 --> 06:19:40.798 align:start position:0%
the effort that went into it thank you
 
06:19:43.030 --> 06:19:43.040 align:start position:0%
representative folsom
 
06:19:46.230 --> 06:19:46.240 align:start position:0%
um thank you mr chair i i
 
06:19:49.190 --> 06:19:49.200 align:start position:0%
as i'm looking at this section um
 
06:19:52.150 --> 06:19:52.160 align:start position:0%
five with um the valid registry
 
06:19:55.030 --> 06:19:55.040 align:start position:0%
identification card or it's equivalent
 
06:19:57.270 --> 06:19:57.280 align:start position:0%
i think with the way that this is
 
06:19:57.280 --> 06:19:58.230 align:start position:0%
i think with the way that this is
written

06:19:58.230 --> 06:19:58.240 align:start position:0%
written
 
06:20:00.788 --> 06:20:00.798 align:start position:0%
with uh people coming from
 
06:20:03.110 --> 06:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
could come from a large variety of
 
06:20:09.430 --> 06:20:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:12.150 --> 06:20:12.160 align:start position:0%
personnel to be able to judge whether or
 
06:20:15.350 --> 06:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
not the card is real
 
06:20:17.110 --> 06:20:17.120 align:start position:0%
are they going to have to have a book
 
06:20:17.120 --> 06:20:17.990 align:start position:0%
are they going to have to have a book
with

06:20:17.990 --> 06:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
with
 
06:20:20.708 --> 06:20:20.718 align:start position:0%
what the cards look like from each state
 
06:20:23.430 --> 06:20:23.440 align:start position:0%
or from each country or province or
 
06:20:23.440 --> 06:20:24.708 align:start position:0%
or from each country or province or
territory

06:20:24.708 --> 06:20:24.718 align:start position:0%
territory
 
06:20:27.990 --> 06:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
so that they know how that it's actually
 
06:20:28.000 --> 06:20:28.948 align:start position:0%
so that they know how that it's actually
really

06:20:28.948 --> 06:20:28.958 align:start position:0%
really
 
06:20:31.190 --> 06:20:31.200 align:start position:0%
an id card and not just
 
06:20:34.150 --> 06:20:34.160 align:start position:0%
some card made up to look like a
 
06:20:36.628 --> 06:20:36.638 align:start position:0%
professional id card
 
06:20:38.708 --> 06:20:38.718 align:start position:0%
so i struggle with that because all of a
 
06:20:40.628 --> 06:20:40.638 align:start position:0%
sudden we're putting that decision
 
06:20:45.830 --> 06:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:48.628 --> 06:20:48.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:50.548 --> 06:20:50.558 align:start position:0%
everyone else
 
06:20:53.270 --> 06:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
representative gay
 
06:20:56.150 --> 06:20:56.160 align:start position:0%
i also feel uncomfortable
 
06:21:01.110 --> 06:21:01.120 align:start position:0%
about two and three and the uh amendment
 
06:21:03.590 --> 06:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
for the reasons that our clerk just
 
06:21:03.600 --> 06:21:05.590 align:start position:0%
for the reasons that our clerk just
stated

06:21:05.590 --> 06:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
stated
 
06:21:07.830 --> 06:21:07.840 align:start position:0%
and um
 
06:21:10.310 --> 06:21:10.320 align:start position:0%
i'm also thinking that if you're using
 
06:21:11.670 --> 06:21:11.680 align:start position:0%
cannabis for
 
06:21:14.470 --> 06:21:14.480 align:start position:0%
treatment you know exactly which kinds
 
06:21:16.310 --> 06:21:16.320 align:start position:0%
you've tried that work
 
06:21:18.708 --> 06:21:18.718 align:start position:0%
if you're coming on a vacation
 
06:21:20.708 --> 06:21:20.718 align:start position:0%
i don't mean you but people
 
06:21:24.150 --> 06:21:24.160 align:start position:0%
um if going on vacation or traveling
 
06:21:26.548 --> 06:21:26.558 align:start position:0%
whatever medication i take i take it
 
06:21:29.430 --> 06:21:29.440 align:start position:0%
with me i don't count on finding it
 
06:21:32.708 --> 06:21:32.718 align:start position:0%
and um so i'm not real concerned about
 
06:21:35.270 --> 06:21:35.280 align:start position:0%
somebody visiting here and producing a
 
06:21:36.470 --> 06:21:36.480 align:start position:0%
card and
 
06:21:36.480 --> 06:21:37.510 align:start position:0%
card and
shopping

06:21:37.510 --> 06:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
shopping
 
06:21:38.868 --> 06:21:38.878 align:start position:0%
for their cannabis
 
06:21:41.510 --> 06:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
for medical reasons
 
06:21:41.520 --> 06:21:42.788 align:start position:0%
for medical reasons
um

06:21:42.788 --> 06:21:42.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:21:45.190 --> 06:21:45.200 align:start position:0%
and i also like to
 
06:21:48.310 --> 06:21:48.320 align:start position:0%
not feel real comfortable until treating
 
06:21:50.230 --> 06:21:50.240 align:start position:0%
an opioid
 
06:21:53.590 --> 06:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:55.990 --> 06:21:56.000 align:start position:0%
you take too much
 
06:21:58.070 --> 06:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
i'd like to see a lot more research on
 
06:21:59.110 --> 06:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
giving them
 
06:21:59.120 --> 06:22:00.390 align:start position:0%
giving them
another

06:22:00.390 --> 06:22:00.400 align:start position:0%
another
 
06:22:00.400 --> 06:22:01.750 align:start position:0%
another
another

06:22:01.750 --> 06:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
another
 
06:22:03.350 --> 06:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
well marijuana
 
06:22:06.628 --> 06:22:06.638 align:start position:0%
to be specific as a cure it sounds like
 
06:22:10.310 --> 06:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
swapping what you're dependent upon
 
06:22:11.910 --> 06:22:11.920 align:start position:0%
representative connor can you answer
 
06:22:13.590 --> 06:22:13.600 align:start position:0%
that if you wish
 
06:22:15.590 --> 06:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
yes um i mean the problem with bringing
 
06:22:17.510 --> 06:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
your own medications is that this is a
 
06:22:17.520 --> 06:22:18.390 align:start position:0%
your own medications is that this is a
drug

06:22:18.390 --> 06:22:18.400 align:start position:0%
drug
 
06:22:21.030 --> 06:22:21.040 align:start position:0%
uh therapeutic cannabis is illegal to
 
06:22:22.788 --> 06:22:22.798 align:start position:0%
cross state lines or to enter into the
 
06:22:25.270 --> 06:22:25.280 align:start position:0%
united states with so it's not something
 
06:22:26.868 --> 06:22:26.878 align:start position:0%
that like your prescription for the
 
06:22:28.310 --> 06:22:28.320 align:start position:0%
center probe which you can just take
 
06:22:30.548 --> 06:22:30.558 align:start position:0%
with you when you travel so that's why
 
06:22:31.990 --> 06:22:32.000 align:start position:0%
we always have to do all these
 
06:22:33.830 --> 06:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
contortions to deal with the fact that
 
06:22:35.510 --> 06:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
it's federally illegal
 
06:22:37.830 --> 06:22:37.840 align:start position:0%
but it is allowable in the state in a
 
06:22:39.670 --> 06:22:39.680 align:start position:0%
therapeutic fashion
 
06:22:42.788 --> 06:22:42.798 align:start position:0%
um with regard to the other piece um the
 
06:22:45.110 --> 06:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
goal here is not just to say oh go use
 
06:22:48.548 --> 06:22:48.558 align:start position:0%
cannabis for treating oud and that's why
 
06:22:50.628 --> 06:22:50.638 align:start position:0%
this very high bar of it needing to be a
 
06:22:52.590 --> 06:22:52.600 align:start position:0%
person who's already qualified to do
 
06:22:54.230 --> 06:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
medication-assisted treatment that would
 
06:22:56.868 --> 06:22:56.878 align:start position:0%
be like suboxone
 
06:22:58.788 --> 06:22:58.798 align:start position:0%
where a bit for that particular patient
 
06:22:58.798 --> 06:22:59.670 align:start position:0%
where a bit for that particular patient
or

06:22:59.670 --> 06:22:59.680 align:start position:0%
or
 
06:23:02.150 --> 06:23:02.160 align:start position:0%
a addictions uh medicine or addiction
 
06:23:04.230 --> 06:23:04.240 align:start position:0%
psychiatry physician so these are
 
06:23:06.070 --> 06:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
individuals who will know what they're
 
06:23:07.670 --> 06:23:07.680 align:start position:0%
doing and would be
 
06:23:09.510 --> 06:23:09.520 align:start position:0%
trying to use a mix of
 
06:23:12.230 --> 06:23:12.240 align:start position:0%
medications they may use suboxone but
 
06:23:15.350 --> 06:23:15.360 align:start position:0%
they also may add some
 
06:23:16.948 --> 06:23:16.958 align:start position:0%
cbd rich
 
06:23:21.270 --> 06:23:21.280 align:start position:0%
cannabis to decrease the the cravings
 
06:23:23.910 --> 06:23:23.920 align:start position:0%
and the withdrawal symptoms because
 
06:23:25.350 --> 06:23:25.360 align:start position:0%
that's where we do have some evidence
 
06:23:27.190 --> 06:23:27.200 align:start position:0%
that it can be helpful
 
06:23:29.110 --> 06:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
and that's why we said in these
 
06:23:30.070 --> 06:23:30.080 align:start position:0%
why the
 
06:23:31.750 --> 06:23:31.760 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis medical oversight
 
06:23:34.230 --> 06:23:34.240 align:start position:0%
board even though we sort of overall
 
06:23:37.110 --> 06:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
never voted to go for it did continue to
 
06:23:39.270 --> 06:23:39.280 align:start position:0%
work on it even afterward to continue to
 
06:23:40.948 --> 06:23:40.958 align:start position:0%
put enough restrictions in that we felt
 
06:23:42.868 --> 06:23:42.878 align:start position:0%
it would be workable and it probably
 
06:23:44.070 --> 06:23:44.080 align:start position:0%
would have been better if we had just
 
06:23:45.750 --> 06:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
revoked it some time but we never
 
06:23:45.760 --> 06:23:46.628 align:start position:0%
revoked it some time but we never
actually

06:23:46.628 --> 06:23:46.638 align:start position:0%
actually
 
06:23:48.628 --> 06:23:48.638 align:start position:0%
did a revote on it we just kept tweaking
 
06:23:50.948 --> 06:23:50.958 align:start position:0%
it because it was a sort of a fade.com
 
06:23:53.190 --> 06:23:53.200 align:start position:0%
plea after it got passed last year and
 
06:23:55.270 --> 06:23:55.280 align:start position:0%
we added this further language so it
 
06:23:57.430 --> 06:23:57.440 align:start position:0%
went to the senate it could be amended
 
06:23:58.868 --> 06:23:58.878 align:start position:0%
to be even better
 
06:23:58.878 --> 06:23:59.750 align:start position:0%
to be even better
so

06:23:59.750 --> 06:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:24:00.948 --> 06:24:00.958 align:start position:0%
i you know i agree that there are
 
06:24:02.310 --> 06:24:02.320 align:start position:0%
concerns that's why i brought it up for
 
06:24:04.070 --> 06:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
discussion because it was not a slam
 
06:24:06.868 --> 06:24:06.878 align:start position:0%
dunk like insomnia was or
 
06:24:06.878 --> 06:24:07.990 align:start position:0%
dunk like insomnia was or
asd

06:24:07.990 --> 06:24:08.000 align:start position:0%
asd
 
06:24:09.670 --> 06:24:09.680 align:start position:0%
but it was something which
 
06:24:09.680 --> 06:24:10.948 align:start position:0%
but it was something which
um

06:24:10.948 --> 06:24:10.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:24:12.868 --> 06:24:12.878 align:start position:0%
you know there are pretty high bars that
 
06:24:15.670 --> 06:24:15.680 align:start position:0%
we've put in here to try to make it only
 
06:24:16.948 --> 06:24:16.958 align:start position:0%
from people who know what they're doing
 
06:24:18.390 --> 06:24:18.400 align:start position:0%
not just your primary care doc that
 
06:24:20.628 --> 06:24:20.638 align:start position:0%
certifies you to go use cannabis to
 
06:24:24.708 --> 06:24:24.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:26.470 --> 06:24:26.480 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
06:24:29.750 --> 06:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
i see representative merchants
 
06:24:31.510 --> 06:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
06:24:31.520 --> 06:24:32.390 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
and

06:24:32.390 --> 06:24:32.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:24:33.670 --> 06:24:33.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
06:24:33.680 --> 06:24:35.110 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
representative

06:24:35.110 --> 06:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:24:37.270 --> 06:24:37.280 align:start position:0%
i want to follow up on the issue about
 
06:24:39.590 --> 06:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
crossing state lines
 
06:24:41.670 --> 06:24:41.680 align:start position:0%
we want people to come to new hampshire
 
06:24:43.590 --> 06:24:43.600 align:start position:0%
from outside the state so they can spend
 
06:24:44.628 --> 06:24:44.638 align:start position:0%
their money
 
06:24:46.788 --> 06:24:46.798 align:start position:0%
and be here
 
06:24:48.230 --> 06:24:48.240 align:start position:0%
and i think one of the things that we
 
06:24:51.030 --> 06:24:51.040 align:start position:0%
have as a barrier sometimes is that
 
06:24:51.990 --> 06:24:52.000 align:start position:0%
we don't
 
06:24:54.788 --> 06:24:54.798 align:start position:0%
allow for people who are on cannabis
 
06:24:54.798 --> 06:24:55.830 align:start position:0%
allow for people who are on cannabis
medically

06:24:55.830 --> 06:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
medically
 
06:24:57.830 --> 06:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
to obtain it here so puts them in a
 
06:24:59.670 --> 06:24:59.680 align:start position:0%
quandary between do i go to new
 
06:25:00.868 --> 06:25:00.878 align:start position:0%
hampshire and take the chance of getting
 
06:25:00.878 --> 06:25:01.830 align:start position:0%
hampshire and take the chance of getting
arrested

06:25:01.830 --> 06:25:01.840 align:start position:0%
arrested
 
06:25:04.150 --> 06:25:04.160 align:start position:0%
across state lines to take a plane
 
06:25:06.788 --> 06:25:06.798 align:start position:0%
or do i land in manchester
 
06:25:08.948 --> 06:25:08.958 align:start position:0%
and be able to go to dispensary and buy
 
06:25:10.548 --> 06:25:10.558 align:start position:0%
the product
 
06:25:12.628 --> 06:25:12.638 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of reciprocal agreements
 
06:25:14.310 --> 06:25:14.320 align:start position:0%
between our states including driver's
 
06:25:16.390 --> 06:25:16.400 align:start position:0%
license marriage license and so forth
 
06:25:17.750 --> 06:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
this is my opinion just another
 
06:25:19.590 --> 06:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
extension of that
 
06:25:21.430 --> 06:25:21.440 align:start position:0%
reciprocity that we enjoy amongst the
 
06:25:24.868 --> 06:25:24.878 align:start position:0%
states that we honor the other state's
 
06:25:27.590 --> 06:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
requirements for getting a license or in
 
06:25:29.190 --> 06:25:29.200 align:start position:0%
this case getting a
 
06:25:31.590 --> 06:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
permit card to buy the cannabis so i
 
06:25:33.830 --> 06:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
support the amendment i also support the
 
06:25:35.910 --> 06:25:35.920 align:start position:0%
bill i want to say first and foremost
 
06:25:37.990 --> 06:25:38.000 align:start position:0%
though to represent connect
 
06:25:39.590 --> 06:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking an eight or nine
 
06:25:41.750 --> 06:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
page document and getting it down to
 
06:25:43.510 --> 06:25:43.520 align:start position:0%
three pages that in itself was an
 
06:25:43.520 --> 06:25:46.548 align:start position:0%
three pages that in itself was an
accomplishment

06:25:46.548 --> 06:25:46.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:48.390 --> 06:25:48.400 align:start position:0%
well my cold helped me a lot we worked
 
06:25:48.400 --> 06:25:53.750 align:start position:0%
well my cold helped me a lot we worked
together

06:25:53.750 --> 06:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:55.510 --> 06:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
and by the way i should say i have
 
06:25:57.110 --> 06:25:57.120 align:start position:0%
texted mike hold and asked him if he
 
06:25:58.868 --> 06:25:58.878 align:start position:0%
could join in to ask answer some of
 
06:26:01.990 --> 06:26:02.000 align:start position:0%
those questions he's not yet responded i
 
06:26:03.670 --> 06:26:03.680 align:start position:0%
wish i could get him in because he would
 
06:26:04.948 --> 06:26:04.958 align:start position:0%
be able to give some of the reasons
 
06:26:07.350 --> 06:26:07.360 align:start position:0%
because that was a department request to
 
06:26:08.470 --> 06:26:08.480 align:start position:0%
have that in
 
06:26:08.480 --> 06:26:10.310 align:start position:0%
have that in
um

06:26:10.310 --> 06:26:10.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:26:11.350 --> 06:26:11.360 align:start position:0%
i mean it was
 
06:26:11.360 --> 06:26:13.510 align:start position:0%
i mean it was
yeah

06:26:13.510 --> 06:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
06:26:15.590 --> 06:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
i do see that abigail rogers has raised
 
06:26:16.548 --> 06:26:16.558 align:start position:0%
her hand
 
06:26:27.270 --> 06:26:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:28.868 --> 06:26:28.878 align:start position:0%
hi members of the committee this is abby

06:26:33.030 --> 06:26:33.040 align:start position:0%
the department um thank you very much
 
06:26:35.350 --> 06:26:35.360 align:start position:0%
for letting me speak i uh also reached
 
06:26:37.030 --> 06:26:37.040 align:start position:0%
out to mike holt to hope hopefully that
 
06:26:39.510 --> 06:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
he could join because he has uh the best
 
06:26:41.350 --> 06:26:41.360 align:start position:0%
information on some of your questions
 
06:26:43.350 --> 06:26:43.360 align:start position:0%
related to therapy to canvas and this
 
06:26:45.670 --> 06:26:45.680 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation um but in lieu of
 
06:26:47.350 --> 06:26:47.360 align:start position:0%
him being there i can try to answer some
 
06:26:49.110 --> 06:26:49.120 align:start position:0%
questions for you or also take questions
 
06:26:50.708 --> 06:26:50.718 align:start position:0%
back for mike whatever would be most
 
06:26:55.510 --> 06:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:58.628 --> 06:26:58.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:01.590 --> 06:27:01.600 align:start position:0%
thank you um so am i right in thinking
 
06:27:03.110 --> 06:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
that that the language that we were
 
06:27:05.590 --> 06:27:05.600 align:start position:0%
talking about about residency was in
 
06:27:08.708 --> 06:27:08.718 align:start position:0%
fact a request of the department
 
06:27:11.030 --> 06:27:11.040 align:start position:0%
um that i'm not sure on on that
 
06:27:13.190 --> 06:27:13.200 align:start position:0%
particular provision um
 
06:27:15.910 --> 06:27:15.920 align:start position:0%
uh i know that uh representative knurk

working closely together on the language

06:27:27.670 --> 06:27:27.680 align:start position:0%

06:27:29.590 --> 06:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
100 certain

were requested by dhhs
 
06:27:38.708 --> 06:27:38.718 align:start position:0%
i may be incorrect
 
06:27:41.990 --> 06:27:42.000 align:start position:0%

um
 
06:29:00.708 --> 06:29:00.718 align:start position:0%
part of the original bill that was about
 
06:29:03.190 --> 06:29:03.200 align:start position:0%
the cultivation of marijuana now has
 
06:29:05.270 --> 06:29:05.280 align:start position:0%
that been
 
06:29:07.190 --> 06:29:07.200 align:start position:0%
is that been stripped from this
 
06:29:07.200 --> 06:29:10.310 align:start position:0%
is that been stripped from this
amendment

06:29:10.310 --> 06:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:13.270 --> 06:29:13.280 align:start position:0%
yes but we also passed that bill too i'm
 
06:29:15.190 --> 06:29:15.200 align:start position:0%
blanking now on the number
 
06:29:15.200 --> 06:29:16.310 align:start position:0%
blanking now on the number
um

06:29:16.310 --> 06:29:16.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:29:18.070 --> 06:29:18.080 align:start position:0%
that was one i think that representative
 
06:29:19.510 --> 06:29:19.520 align:start position:0%
acton brought in so he should be able to
 
06:29:21.350 --> 06:29:21.360 align:start position:0%
throw that number at us
 
06:29:24.070 --> 06:29:24.080 align:start position:0%
okay but it's still referred to under um
 
06:29:27.140 --> 06:29:27.150 align:start position:0%
online hp 350.19.

18 and 19.
 
06:29:38.708 --> 06:29:38.718 align:start position:0%
page one
 
06:29:44.708 --> 06:29:44.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:44.718 --> 06:29:49.270 align:start position:0%
 
um

06:29:49.270 --> 06:29:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:50.788 --> 06:29:50.798 align:start position:0%
curses let's see
 
06:29:53.270 --> 06:29:53.280 align:start position:0%
yeah that was hp 350. if you guys can
 
06:29:54.390 --> 06:29:54.400 align:start position:0%
hear me
 
06:29:57.430 --> 06:29:57.440 align:start position:0%
yes we can okay thanks
 
06:29:59.110 --> 06:29:59.120 align:start position:0%
actually but sorry but that that again
 
06:30:01.110 --> 06:30:01.120 align:start position:0%
comes in as a visiting qualifying
 
06:30:02.468 --> 06:30:02.478 align:start position:0%
patient piece
 
06:30:02.478 --> 06:30:03.430 align:start position:0%
patient piece
um

06:30:03.430 --> 06:30:03.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:30:06.230 --> 06:30:06.240 align:start position:0%
so that a visiting qualifying patient uh
 
06:30:07.910 --> 06:30:07.920 align:start position:0%
would be able to purchase
 
06:30:07.920 --> 06:30:08.948 align:start position:0%
would be able to purchase
from

06:30:08.948 --> 06:30:08.958 align:start position:0%
from
 
06:30:11.190 --> 06:30:11.200 align:start position:0%
a qualifying patient or designated
 
06:30:11.200 --> 06:30:16.948 align:start position:0%
a qualifying patient or designated
caregiver

06:30:16.948 --> 06:30:16.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:18.468 --> 06:30:18.478 align:start position:0%
so does that
 
06:30:20.708 --> 06:30:20.718 align:start position:0%
excuse me follow-up
 
06:30:20.718 --> 06:30:21.990 align:start position:0%
excuse me follow-up
oh

06:30:21.990 --> 06:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
oh
 
06:30:24.788 --> 06:30:24.798 align:start position:0%
does that infer that a visiting
 
06:30:27.590 --> 06:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
person with a card could cultivate
 
06:30:34.150 --> 06:30:34.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:35.910 --> 06:30:35.920 align:start position:0%
that is a good question which again i do
 
06:30:38.150 --> 06:30:38.160 align:start position:0%
not know i relied too much on mike holt
 
06:30:38.160 --> 06:30:38.868 align:start position:0%
not know i relied too much on mike holt
on

06:30:38.868 --> 06:30:38.878 align:start position:0%
on
 
06:30:42.390 --> 06:30:42.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:45.190 --> 06:30:45.200 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to just quickly pull up the
 
06:30:55.590 --> 06:30:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:01.110 --> 06:31:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:02.948 --> 06:31:02.958 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i didn't hear that
 
06:31:05.590 --> 06:31:05.600 align:start position:0%
uh representative weber i had a quick
 
06:31:07.190 --> 06:31:07.200 align:start position:0%
point of procedure
 
06:31:07.200 --> 06:31:08.468 align:start position:0%
point of procedure
sure

06:31:08.468 --> 06:31:08.478 align:start position:0%
sure
 
06:31:10.868 --> 06:31:10.878 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm wondering if
 
06:31:10.878 --> 06:31:11.830 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm wondering if
it

06:31:11.830 --> 06:31:11.840 align:start position:0%
it
 
06:31:13.510 --> 06:31:13.520 align:start position:0%
it sounds to me like there are a couple
 
06:31:14.948 --> 06:31:14.958 align:start position:0%
of definite
 
06:31:16.468 --> 06:31:16.478 align:start position:0%
concerns here
 
06:31:18.868 --> 06:31:18.878 align:start position:0%
one of which is the
 
06:31:22.390 --> 06:31:22.400 align:start position:0%
um issue of opioid use disorder
 
06:31:25.590 --> 06:31:25.600 align:start position:0%
which is problematical for some people
 
06:31:29.110 --> 06:31:29.120 align:start position:0%
a second one of which is uh
 
06:31:31.190 --> 06:31:31.200 align:start position:0%
at at a minimum
 
06:31:31.200 --> 06:31:33.030 align:start position:0%
at at a minimum
the

06:31:33.030 --> 06:31:33.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:31:35.270 --> 06:31:35.280 align:start position:0%
inclusion of people from outside the
 
06:31:37.750 --> 06:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
united states
 
06:31:39.110 --> 06:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
in the
 
06:31:39.120 --> 06:31:40.150 align:start position:0%
in the
um

06:31:40.150 --> 06:31:40.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:31:43.990 --> 06:31:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:46.628 --> 06:31:46.638 align:start position:0%
population and then the third thing is
 
06:31:46.638 --> 06:31:47.430 align:start position:0%
population and then the third thing is
the

06:31:47.430 --> 06:31:47.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:31:50.628 --> 06:31:50.638 align:start position:0%
uh interpretation of 18 and 19 which is
 
06:31:52.548 --> 06:31:52.558 align:start position:0%
a matter of looking back at the rest of
 
06:31:55.430 --> 06:31:55.440 align:start position:0%
the statute that exists and seeing how
 
06:31:56.868 --> 06:31:56.878 align:start position:0%
it changes it
 
06:31:59.510 --> 06:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering if it might be a good
 
06:32:03.350 --> 06:32:03.360 align:start position:0%
idea at this point to recess the
 
06:32:05.990 --> 06:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
executive session on this bill till the
 
06:32:07.190 --> 06:32:07.200 align:start position:0%
next week
 
06:32:09.030 --> 06:32:09.040 align:start position:0%
so that some of those things could be
 
06:32:11.110 --> 06:32:11.120 align:start position:0%
explored and perhaps
 
06:32:13.030 --> 06:32:13.040 align:start position:0%
um an amendment or two in the
 
06:32:17.030 --> 06:32:17.040 align:start position:0%
alternative prepared so that um
 
06:32:18.230 --> 06:32:18.240 align:start position:0%
we could
 
06:32:20.150 --> 06:32:20.160 align:start position:0%
achieve some kind of consensus about
 
06:32:22.628 --> 06:32:22.638 align:start position:0%
those things that the committee is
 
06:32:25.350 --> 06:32:25.360 align:start position:0%
really clear on and and and strip out
 
06:32:27.750 --> 06:32:27.760 align:start position:0%
some of the things or or give a choice
 
06:32:29.190 --> 06:32:29.200 align:start position:0%
on some of the things that the committee
 
06:32:30.948 --> 06:32:30.958 align:start position:0%
is less clear on
 
06:32:32.468 --> 06:32:32.478 align:start position:0%
would definitely matter to
 
06:32:32.478 --> 06:32:34.150 align:start position:0%
would definitely matter to
representatives

06:32:34.150 --> 06:32:34.160 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
06:32:35.990 --> 06:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
yes actually that's very much what i was
 
06:32:37.510 --> 06:32:37.520 align:start position:0%
beginning to think about is listening to
 
06:32:40.548 --> 06:32:40.558 align:start position:0%
the conversation as it evolves and and
 
06:32:41.830 --> 06:32:41.840 align:start position:0%
coming up with that i should also
 
06:32:44.150 --> 06:32:44.160 align:start position:0%
quickly report that i was able to find
 
06:32:45.350 --> 06:32:45.360 align:start position:0%
this uh
 
06:32:47.910 --> 06:32:47.920 align:start position:0%
the uh the lines that represent shapiro
 
06:32:51.430 --> 06:32:51.440 align:start position:0%
brought up lines 18 and 19. it is those
 
06:32:52.788 --> 06:32:52.798 align:start position:0%
are exceptions in other words
 
06:32:54.948 --> 06:32:54.958 align:start position:0%
therapeutic use means everything but
 
06:32:58.468 --> 06:32:58.478 align:start position:0%
does not include so it does not include
 
06:33:00.948 --> 06:33:00.958 align:start position:0%
cultivation or purchase by so no it does
 
06:33:03.190 --> 06:33:03.200 align:start position:0%
not allow cultivation it it explicitly
 
06:33:05.990 --> 06:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
says you can't cultivate it's one of the
 
06:33:07.510 --> 06:33:07.520 align:start position:0%
things that are not included so my
 
06:33:09.430 --> 06:33:09.440 align:start position:0%
apologies i'm not having that clear
 
06:33:11.190 --> 06:33:11.200 align:start position:0%
so i think that part's easy but i think
 
06:33:12.708 --> 06:33:12.718 align:start position:0%
you're right we have
 
06:33:12.718 --> 06:33:13.910 align:start position:0%
you're right we have
the

06:33:13.910 --> 06:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:33:15.670 --> 06:33:15.680 align:start position:0%
oud as a separate thing and i could
 
06:33:17.110 --> 06:33:17.120 align:start position:0%
certainly come up with an amendment that
 
06:33:19.190 --> 06:33:19.200 align:start position:0%
did not include the oud
 
06:33:21.990 --> 06:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
um i would also say that tcmob is
 
06:33:25.030 --> 06:33:25.040 align:start position:0%
meeting this wednesday tomorrow
 
06:33:27.430 --> 06:33:27.440 align:start position:0%
and we perhaps i might have them revisit
 
06:33:29.990 --> 06:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
this with our current language and see
 
06:33:32.230 --> 06:33:32.240 align:start position:0%
what their current status is on this i
 
06:33:34.070 --> 06:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
think that would be very wise i can add
 
06:33:36.070 --> 06:33:36.080 align:start position:0%
that to the agenda and i'll have that
 
06:33:37.830 --> 06:33:37.840 align:start position:0%
answer by next monday
 
06:33:39.350 --> 06:33:39.360 align:start position:0%
and then the last thing is that issue
 
06:33:39.360 --> 06:33:40.390 align:start position:0%
and then the last thing is that issue
about

06:33:40.390 --> 06:33:40.400 align:start position:0%
about
 
06:33:42.390 --> 06:33:42.400 align:start position:0%
the other countries and i can certainly
 
06:33:44.868 --> 06:33:44.878 align:start position:0%
check with mike as to how important that
 
06:33:47.750 --> 06:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
is and perhaps that could be amended out
 
06:33:47.760 --> 06:33:48.628 align:start position:0%
is and perhaps that could be amended out
to

06:33:48.628 --> 06:33:48.638 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:33:50.230 --> 06:33:50.240 align:start position:0%
make uh
 
06:33:51.750 --> 06:33:51.760 align:start position:0%
representative marsh and some others a
 
06:33:53.270 --> 06:33:53.280 align:start position:0%
little bit more comfortable about that
 
06:33:55.190 --> 06:33:55.200 align:start position:0%
issue i would think across the state
 
06:33:57.590 --> 06:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
lines we still have a reason because
 
06:33:57.600 --> 06:33:59.350 align:start position:0%
lines we still have a reason because
when

06:33:59.350 --> 06:33:59.360 align:start position:0%
when
 
06:33:59.360 --> 06:34:00.230 align:start position:0%
when
michael

06:34:00.230 --> 06:34:00.240 align:start position:0%
michael
 
06:34:02.390 --> 06:34:02.400 align:start position:0%
testified he did clearly point out this
 
06:34:05.510 --> 06:34:05.520 align:start position:0%
issue of visiting people students people
 
06:34:08.310 --> 06:34:08.320 align:start position:0%
who have a second home and come over and
 
06:34:11.030 --> 06:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
stay for an extended period of time and
 
06:34:12.548 --> 06:34:12.558 align:start position:0%
it's for that group of people as
 
06:34:14.628 --> 06:34:14.638 align:start position:0%
representative merchant alluded to that
 
06:34:16.070 --> 06:34:16.080 align:start position:0%
we want to be able to have that
 
06:34:18.548 --> 06:34:18.558 align:start position:0%
reciprocity but reciprocity frequently
 
06:34:20.390 --> 06:34:20.400 align:start position:0%
goes across states doesn't necessarily
 
06:34:22.548 --> 06:34:22.558 align:start position:0%
go across country lines
 
06:34:22.558 --> 06:34:23.990 align:start position:0%
go across country lines
so

06:34:23.990 --> 06:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:34:26.708 --> 06:34:26.718 align:start position:0%
would you be willing to withdraw your
 
06:34:29.110 --> 06:34:29.120 align:start position:0%
amendment and representative
 
06:34:31.030 --> 06:34:31.040 align:start position:0%
your second
 
06:34:32.948 --> 06:34:32.958 align:start position:0%
i'll yes i'll be willing to do that and
 
06:34:35.110 --> 06:34:35.120 align:start position:0%
then i'll bring it back with
 
06:34:37.510 --> 06:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
some some work on it after we meet on
 
06:34:41.030 --> 06:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
wednesday and have a fresh one for you
 
06:34:41.040 --> 06:34:42.150 align:start position:0%
wednesday and have a fresh one for you
uh

06:34:42.150 --> 06:34:42.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:34:44.390 --> 06:34:44.400 align:start position:0%
i'll put it in the folder for next
 
06:34:46.788 --> 06:34:46.798 align:start position:0%
monday and shoot it out to us as soon as
 
06:34:47.830 --> 06:34:47.840 align:start position:0%
you can
 
06:34:49.270 --> 06:34:49.280 align:start position:0%
so um
 
06:34:51.750 --> 06:34:51.760 align:start position:0%
you have withdrawn your motion in
 
06:34:54.868 --> 06:34:54.878 align:start position:0%
representative merchant your second um
 
06:34:56.788 --> 06:34:56.798 align:start position:0%
uh representative folsom i think do you
 
06:34:59.990 --> 06:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
have a clerky question uh no uh just a
 
06:35:00.000 --> 06:35:01.750 align:start position:0%
have a clerky question uh no uh just a
statement

06:35:01.750 --> 06:35:01.760 align:start position:0%
statement
 
06:35:04.548 --> 06:35:04.558 align:start position:0%
a regular statement yeah as opposed to a
 
06:35:06.788 --> 06:35:06.798 align:start position:0%
clerky question as opposed to a clerky
 
06:35:09.670 --> 06:35:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:12.708 --> 06:35:12.718 align:start position:0%
okay thank you um representative as
 
06:35:15.350 --> 06:35:15.360 align:start position:0%
you're working on this um
 
06:35:18.788 --> 06:35:18.798 align:start position:0%
if i i can say this much about for
 
06:35:21.430 --> 06:35:21.440 align:start position:0%
myself if you take out the
 
06:35:24.390 --> 06:35:24.400 align:start position:0%
outside of the united states i'd feel a
 
06:35:26.708 --> 06:35:26.718 align:start position:0%
whole lot more comfortable with that
 
06:35:26.718 --> 06:35:27.750 align:start position:0%
whole lot more comfortable with that
portion

06:35:27.750 --> 06:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
portion
 
06:35:29.670 --> 06:35:29.680 align:start position:0%
and um
 
06:35:29.680 --> 06:35:30.390 align:start position:0%
and um
the

06:35:30.390 --> 06:35:30.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:35:30.400 --> 06:35:31.270 align:start position:0%
the
uh

06:35:31.270 --> 06:35:31.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:35:34.468 --> 06:35:34.478 align:start position:0%
when it comes to the opioid i would
 
06:35:37.030 --> 06:35:37.040 align:start position:0%
i would like you to get an input from
 
06:35:38.150 --> 06:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
your board
 
06:35:40.468 --> 06:35:40.478 align:start position:0%
because that's uh you know they've
 
06:35:42.548 --> 06:35:42.558 align:start position:0%
provided us with good information before
 
06:35:42.558 --> 06:35:43.430 align:start position:0%
provided us with good information before
and

06:35:43.430 --> 06:35:43.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:35:45.510 --> 06:35:45.520 align:start position:0%
the information that we have from the
 
06:35:47.750 --> 06:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
previous vote that you told us about
 
06:35:50.310 --> 06:35:50.320 align:start position:0%
makes it very iffy for me
 
06:35:52.230 --> 06:35:52.240 align:start position:0%
um and so
 
06:35:54.708 --> 06:35:54.718 align:start position:0%
uh that i would have to hear a more
 
06:35:54.718 --> 06:35:56.948 align:start position:0%
uh that i would have to hear a more
positive

06:35:56.948 --> 06:35:56.958 align:start position:0%
positive
 
06:35:59.750 --> 06:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
uh response from that group and then i
 
06:36:01.990 --> 06:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
feel much more comfortable about it but
 
06:36:04.150 --> 06:36:04.160 align:start position:0%
my main thing is not from outside the
 
06:36:04.160 --> 06:36:05.990 align:start position:0%
my main thing is not from outside the
states

06:36:05.990 --> 06:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
states
 
06:36:07.350 --> 06:36:07.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for that
 
06:36:08.868 --> 06:36:08.878 align:start position:0%
and that's again why when i presented
 
06:36:10.310 --> 06:36:10.320 align:start position:0%
this amendment i brought up the
 
06:36:12.150 --> 06:36:12.160 align:start position:0%
controversy about this because i wanted
 
06:36:14.310 --> 06:36:14.320 align:start position:0%
people to know that this was not the
 
06:36:15.510 --> 06:36:15.520 align:start position:0%
kind of thing where we did have
 
06:36:17.430 --> 06:36:17.440 align:start position:0%
agreement and it was striking when i
 
06:36:19.670 --> 06:36:19.680 align:start position:0%
brought this back as hp 366 back in the
 
06:36:22.628 --> 06:36:22.638 align:start position:0%
fall of 19 that our subcommittee said
 
06:36:25.270 --> 06:36:25.280 align:start position:0%
yeah let's do it and they you know they
 
06:36:26.708 --> 06:36:26.718 align:start position:0%
wanted the restrictions and then we
 
06:36:27.830 --> 06:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
brought it back to the full committee
 
06:36:29.750 --> 06:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
and they voted to go ahead with it and
 
06:36:33.110 --> 06:36:33.120 align:start position:0%
as i say the tcmob wasn't wasn't like
 
06:36:34.948 --> 06:36:34.958 align:start position:0%
astounded or terribly upset about it
 
06:36:35.990 --> 06:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
they had just just worked on the
 
06:36:38.628 --> 06:36:38.638 align:start position:0%
language a bit more so it is possible
 
06:36:39.910 --> 06:36:39.920 align:start position:0%
and also with the difference in
 
06:36:41.430 --> 06:36:41.440 align:start position:0%
attendance at different meetings we
 
06:36:43.590 --> 06:36:43.600 align:start position:0%
might actually approve but i think that
 
06:36:45.110 --> 06:36:45.120 align:start position:0%
would feel make all of us feel more
 
06:36:47.030 --> 06:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
comfortable because that was the goal so
 
06:36:49.190 --> 06:36:49.200 align:start position:0%
i'd be glad to do this over this next
 
06:36:50.230 --> 06:36:50.240 align:start position:0%
two days
 
06:36:51.910 --> 06:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
and have something ready for you or
 
06:36:51.920 --> 06:36:52.948 align:start position:0%
and have something ready for you or
perhaps

06:36:52.948 --> 06:36:52.958 align:start position:0%
perhaps
 
06:36:54.390 --> 06:36:54.400 align:start position:0%
a couple of amendments ready that we
 
06:36:55.670 --> 06:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
could then figure out which one will
 
06:36:57.670 --> 06:36:57.680 align:start position:0%
work best for this group
 
06:36:59.430 --> 06:36:59.440 align:start position:0%
so just to make sure i'm not missing
 
06:36:59.440 --> 06:37:00.468 align:start position:0%
so just to make sure i'm not missing
anything

06:37:00.468 --> 06:37:00.478 align:start position:0%
anything
 
06:37:02.788 --> 06:37:02.798 align:start position:0%
oud was one concern
 
06:37:05.750 --> 06:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
other countries clearly a concern
 
06:37:07.350 --> 06:37:07.360 align:start position:0%
uh representative cushman's concern
 
06:37:08.948 --> 06:37:08.958 align:start position:0%
about the atc's need to know what
 
06:37:10.548 --> 06:37:10.558 align:start position:0%
foreign cards look like gets us back to
 
06:37:13.990 --> 06:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
that uh other countries type question
 
06:37:15.350 --> 06:37:15.360 align:start position:0%
and i think
 
06:37:18.788 --> 06:37:18.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:18.798 --> 06:37:19.990 align:start position:0%
 
jerry

06:37:19.990 --> 06:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
jerry
 
06:37:20.000 --> 06:37:20.868 align:start position:0%
jerry
um

06:37:20.868 --> 06:37:20.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:37:23.990 --> 06:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
while we're helping him rewrite bell
 
06:37:26.708 --> 06:37:26.718 align:start position:0%
uh to make it as possible for as many of
 
06:37:29.590 --> 06:37:29.600 align:start position:0%
us as possible to vote for um let him
 
06:37:32.628 --> 06:37:32.638 align:start position:0%
know if there's any other sticky spots
 
06:37:32.638 --> 06:37:33.510 align:start position:0%
know if there's any other sticky spots
because

06:37:33.510 --> 06:37:33.520 align:start position:0%
because
 
06:37:35.270 --> 06:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
please let me know today
 
06:37:38.468 --> 06:37:38.478 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah i hate to come in and and i
 
06:37:40.310 --> 06:37:40.320 align:start position:0%
mean we do a great job here
 
06:37:41.990 --> 06:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
yeah sometimes
 
06:37:44.070 --> 06:37:44.080 align:start position:0%
and i that's a that's a good thing about
 
06:37:45.590 --> 06:37:45.600 align:start position:0%
this committee so let's hope on this
 
06:37:48.070 --> 06:37:48.080 align:start position:0%
representative weber
 
06:37:51.510 --> 06:37:51.520 align:start position:0%
um i'm sorry i i had not yet lowered my
 
06:37:55.270 --> 06:37:55.280 align:start position:0%
hand from my last go-round so
 
06:37:57.430 --> 06:37:57.440 align:start position:0%
oh sorry
 
06:38:00.868 --> 06:38:00.878 align:start position:0%
hey i what and last comment i i do
 
06:38:02.788 --> 06:38:02.798 align:start position:0%
appreciate this again this was not my
 
06:38:05.190 --> 06:38:05.200 align:start position:0%
bill and so it was a kind of a salvage
 
06:38:07.510 --> 06:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
issue and i know we don't rewrite this
 
06:38:08.868 --> 06:38:08.878 align:start position:0%
but it was really a matter of just
 
06:38:10.788 --> 06:38:10.798 align:start position:0%
getting rid of a lot of dead wood and
 
06:38:12.390 --> 06:38:12.400 align:start position:0%
then getting down to the nitty-gritty
 
06:38:13.590 --> 06:38:13.600 align:start position:0%
which was
 
06:38:15.190 --> 06:38:15.200 align:start position:0%
still some nitty-gritty so i will work
 
06:38:16.548 --> 06:38:16.558 align:start position:0%
on it thank you
 
06:38:17.750 --> 06:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
for all right
 
06:38:20.948 --> 06:38:20.958 align:start position:0%
we get it representative gay thank you
 
06:38:20.958 --> 06:38:21.830 align:start position:0%
we get it representative gay thank you
um

06:38:21.830 --> 06:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:38:24.310 --> 06:38:24.320 align:start position:0%
you mentioned something about reciprocal
 
06:38:26.628 --> 06:38:26.638 align:start position:0%
agreements between states
 
06:38:28.548 --> 06:38:28.558 align:start position:0%
the bill doesn't say that but that
 
06:38:30.868 --> 06:38:30.878 align:start position:0%
sounds much more appealing to me
 
06:38:32.150 --> 06:38:32.160 align:start position:0%
than saying
 
06:38:34.230 --> 06:38:34.240 align:start position:0%
somebody can just come with quote a
 
06:38:36.788 --> 06:38:36.798 align:start position:0%
valid registry id card
 
06:38:38.708 --> 06:38:38.718 align:start position:0%
from another state
 
06:38:40.468 --> 06:38:40.478 align:start position:0%
how much how
 
06:38:42.310 --> 06:38:42.320 align:start position:0%
how in sam hill would you know it was
 
06:38:45.270 --> 06:38:45.280 align:start position:0%
any good if you didn't have a reciprocal
 
06:38:48.468 --> 06:38:48.478 align:start position:0%
arrangement with that other state that
 
06:38:49.670 --> 06:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
that would be
 
06:38:51.750 --> 06:38:51.760 align:start position:0%
a deal breaker for me
 
06:38:52.788 --> 06:38:52.798 align:start position:0%
and i'm
 
06:38:54.868 --> 06:38:54.878 align:start position:0%
personally i'm not
 
06:38:57.110 --> 06:38:57.120 align:start position:0%
thrilled i'm still not thrilled with
 
06:38:58.468 --> 06:38:58.478 align:start position:0%
roman numeral
 
06:39:01.190 --> 06:39:01.200 align:start position:0%
adds opioid use disorder i'm not
 
06:39:03.350 --> 06:39:03.360 align:start position:0%
comfortable with that but i am
 
06:39:03.360 --> 06:39:04.788 align:start position:0%
comfortable with that but i am
comfortable

06:39:04.788 --> 06:39:04.798 align:start position:0%
comfortable
 
06:39:08.468 --> 06:39:08.478 align:start position:0%
if you restrict the interstate to
 
06:39:10.310 --> 06:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
states that have an agreement with each
 
06:39:10.320 --> 06:39:13.350 align:start position:0%
states that have an agreement with each
other

06:39:13.350 --> 06:39:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:13.360 --> 06:39:14.830 align:start position:0%
 
anyone

06:39:14.830 --> 06:39:14.840 align:start position:0%
anyone
 
06:39:17.350 --> 06:39:17.360 align:start position:0%
else uh could i just comment i'm not
 
06:39:18.708 --> 06:39:18.718 align:start position:0%
quite sure
 
06:39:20.230 --> 06:39:20.240 align:start position:0%
given the fact that we still are dealing
 
06:39:21.910 --> 06:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
with an interstate uh
 
06:39:23.910 --> 06:39:23.920 align:start position:0%
illegal substance i'm not sure how well
 
06:39:26.628 --> 06:39:26.638 align:start position:0%
we can do true reciprocity issues but i
 
06:39:28.708 --> 06:39:28.718 align:start position:0%
will discuss that with michael thank you
 
06:39:31.910 --> 06:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
i meant the cards recep reciprocity
 
06:39:33.910 --> 06:39:33.920 align:start position:0%
between the iv
 
06:39:37.190 --> 06:39:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:40.390 --> 06:39:40.400 align:start position:0%
representative folsom a new hand yeah a
 
06:39:43.110 --> 06:39:43.120 align:start position:0%
new hand thank you um and i'll remember
 
06:39:44.788 --> 06:39:44.798 align:start position:0%
to take this one down
 
06:39:44.798 --> 06:39:45.670 align:start position:0%
to take this one down
um

06:39:45.670 --> 06:39:45.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:39:48.310 --> 06:39:48.320 align:start position:0%
just a thought here
 
06:39:50.948 --> 06:39:50.958 align:start position:0%
getting rid of all the other countries
 
06:39:53.350 --> 06:39:53.360 align:start position:0%
it is a lot easier
 
06:39:56.230 --> 06:39:56.240 align:start position:0%
to have a little handout for the atc
 
06:39:58.548 --> 06:39:58.558 align:start position:0%
clerks with the with the states that
 
06:40:01.110 --> 06:40:01.120 align:start position:0%
have a medical marijuana card they could
 
06:40:03.590 --> 06:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
have a printout and
 
06:40:05.190 --> 06:40:05.200 align:start position:0%
it's not going to be as cumbersome as
 
06:40:06.708 --> 06:40:06.718 align:start position:0%
trying to come up with ones from other
 
06:40:06.718 --> 06:40:08.070 align:start position:0%
trying to come up with ones from other
countries

06:40:08.070 --> 06:40:08.080 align:start position:0%
countries
 
06:40:10.788 --> 06:40:10.798 align:start position:0%
um so that's that's going to be a little
 
06:40:13.350 --> 06:40:13.360 align:start position:0%
bit easier um
 
06:40:16.230 --> 06:40:16.240 align:start position:0%
and and i i have to tell you that
 
06:40:17.750 --> 06:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
most of
 
06:40:17.760 --> 06:40:19.910 align:start position:0%
most of
um

06:40:19.910 --> 06:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:40:24.868 --> 06:40:24.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:27.270 --> 06:40:27.280 align:start position:0%
most of the marijuana coming uh from
 
06:40:29.750 --> 06:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
that group is coming across state lines
 
06:40:31.350 --> 06:40:31.360 align:start position:0%
and they probably aren't going to use
 
06:40:33.990 --> 06:40:34.000 align:start position:0%
the um atc's anyway
 
06:40:36.548 --> 06:40:36.558 align:start position:0%
so for the most part the people going
 
06:40:39.590 --> 06:40:39.600 align:start position:0%
into the atc's are going to be people
 
06:40:41.350 --> 06:40:41.360 align:start position:0%
with the medical marijuana card if
 
06:40:42.788 --> 06:40:42.798 align:start position:0%
they're from the states i feel
 
06:40:44.468 --> 06:40:44.478 align:start position:0%
comfortable with that
 
06:40:46.310 --> 06:40:46.320 align:start position:0%
um the rest is going to come in
 
06:40:46.320 --> 06:40:48.548 align:start position:0%
um the rest is going to come in
regardless

06:40:48.548 --> 06:40:48.558 align:start position:0%
regardless
 
06:40:50.548 --> 06:40:50.558 align:start position:0%
you get just a few more minutes before
 
06:40:53.590 --> 06:40:53.600 align:start position:0%
some of us turn pumpkins yeah so any
 
06:40:55.670 --> 06:40:55.680 align:start position:0%
last minute
 
06:40:57.510 --> 06:40:57.520 align:start position:0%
comments and if you think of one on the
 
06:40:58.868 --> 06:40:58.878 align:start position:0%
way home
 
06:41:00.628 --> 06:41:00.638 align:start position:0%
you should have representative connect
 
06:41:05.190 --> 06:41:05.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:07.350 --> 06:41:07.360 align:start position:0%
representative nelson thank you
 
06:41:08.948 --> 06:41:08.958 align:start position:0%
thank you what about the state thank you
 
06:41:11.190 --> 06:41:11.200 align:start position:0%
mr chairman what about this states that
 
06:41:13.430 --> 06:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
it's totally legal is it in colorado or
 
06:41:15.190 --> 06:41:15.200 align:start position:0%
someplace anybody can go in and buy it
 
06:41:16.788 --> 06:41:16.798 align:start position:0%
what happens if they come that they
 
06:41:18.628 --> 06:41:18.638 align:start position:0%
don't need a card do they
 
06:41:18.638 --> 06:41:20.708 align:start position:0%
don't need a card do they
yeah

06:41:20.708 --> 06:41:20.718 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
06:41:22.868 --> 06:41:22.878 align:start position:0%
if they wish to buy it in an atc yes
 
06:41:24.150 --> 06:41:24.160 align:start position:0%
they need a card if you wish to buy it
 
06:41:25.430 --> 06:41:25.440 align:start position:0%
in the black market they're welcome to
 
06:41:26.708 --> 06:41:26.718 align:start position:0%
do whatever they wish because it's not
 
06:41:28.150 --> 06:41:28.160 align:start position:0%
legal in this state
 
06:41:30.230 --> 06:41:30.240 align:start position:0%
how about their own state
 
06:41:32.708 --> 06:41:32.718 align:start position:0%
they can buy it in colorado you can buy
 
06:41:34.830 --> 06:41:34.840 align:start position:0%
at a uh
 
06:41:37.670 --> 06:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
non-dispensary anywhere for recreational
 
06:41:41.510 --> 06:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:42.390 --> 06:41:42.400 align:start position:0%
but it's
 
06:41:44.150 --> 06:41:44.160 align:start position:0%
still illegal it's still illegal to
 
06:41:45.990 --> 06:41:46.000 align:start position:0%
bring it into another state
 
06:41:52.548 --> 06:41:52.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:54.150 --> 06:41:54.160 align:start position:0%
seeing no further hands up and not
 
06:41:55.430 --> 06:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
really just
 
06:41:57.350 --> 06:41:57.360 align:start position:0%
to clarify so
 
06:41:59.590 --> 06:41:59.600 align:start position:0%
in colorado you can have one of two
 
06:42:01.830 --> 06:42:01.840 align:start position:0%
different things you can still have a
 
06:42:05.270 --> 06:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
card in colorado uh so you would have
 
06:42:08.230 --> 06:42:08.240 align:start position:0%
the card in colorado to bring here
 
06:42:10.468 --> 06:42:10.478 align:start position:0%
because your color colorado card
 
06:42:11.990 --> 06:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
entitles you to a different tax
 
06:42:13.750 --> 06:42:13.760 align:start position:0%
structure than your
 
06:42:16.548 --> 06:42:16.558 align:start position:0%
uh recreational use so it's not that
 
06:42:19.190 --> 06:42:19.200 align:start position:0%
they don't have a card they have a card
 
06:42:20.788 --> 06:42:20.798 align:start position:0%
and they could bring the card and
 
06:42:23.030 --> 06:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
without the card they can't just say hey
 
06:42:24.868 --> 06:42:24.878 align:start position:0%
it's legal in colorado so you have to
 
06:42:26.548 --> 06:42:26.558 align:start position:0%
give me
 
06:42:28.548 --> 06:42:28.558 align:start position:0%
therapeutic marijuana they have to have
 
06:42:29.750 --> 06:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
a card
 
06:42:31.030 --> 06:42:31.040 align:start position:0%
and i think that that's the case for
 
06:42:33.190 --> 06:42:33.200 align:start position:0%
most of the other states too
 
06:42:34.868 --> 06:42:34.878 align:start position:0%
thank you and with that i'm going to
 
06:42:37.110 --> 06:42:37.120 align:start position:0%
bring this hearing this exact session
 
06:42:40.548 --> 06:42:40.558 align:start position:0%
whatever this is exact session on hp 605
 
06:42:44.628 --> 06:42:44.638 align:start position:0%
to a close on monday the 8th of march
 
06:42:46.390 --> 06:42:46.400 align:start position:0%
we will be
 
06:42:50.708 --> 06:42:50.718 align:start position:0%
looking for the first time at bill 506
 
06:42:55.750 --> 06:42:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:55.760 --> 06:42:57.270 align:start position:0%
 
103.

06:42:57.270 --> 06:42:57.280 align:start position:0%
103.
 
06:42:59.270 --> 06:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
now i've got a bit of a confusion here
 
06:43:01.830 --> 06:43:01.840 align:start position:0%
one of my notes say that we finished
 
06:43:04.548 --> 06:43:04.558 align:start position:0%
the hearing on 601.
 
06:43:07.190 --> 06:43:07.200 align:start position:0%
another note says that we didn't and it
 
06:43:08.948 --> 06:43:08.958 align:start position:0%
can't be both so what is your
 
06:43:11.990 --> 06:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
recollection on 601 what was the title
 
06:43:13.430 --> 06:43:13.440 align:start position:0%
of 601
 
06:43:13.440 --> 06:43:14.468 align:start position:0%
of 601
oh

06:43:14.468 --> 06:43:14.478 align:start position:0%
oh
 
06:43:18.150 --> 06:43:18.160 align:start position:0%
that's our 601 um
 
06:43:20.230 --> 06:43:20.240 align:start position:0%
the private personal information
 
06:43:22.310 --> 06:43:22.320 align:start position:0%
retained by a health or social service
 
06:43:24.070 --> 06:43:24.080 align:start position:0%
agency of prohibiting the sharing
 
06:43:28.708 --> 06:43:28.718 align:start position:0%
thereof we have not exact 601 another i
 
06:43:28.718 --> 06:43:29.510 align:start position:0%
thereof we have not exact 601 another i
thought

06:43:29.510 --> 06:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
thought
 
06:43:32.230 --> 06:43:32.240 align:start position:0%
i thought we hadn't finished the hearing
 
06:43:33.590 --> 06:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
on that one
 
06:43:33.600 --> 06:43:34.468 align:start position:0%
on that one
but

06:43:34.468 --> 06:43:34.478 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:43:38.628 --> 06:43:38.638 align:start position:0%
if 602 was the it was either 601 or 602
 
06:43:40.788 --> 06:43:40.798 align:start position:0%
but i don't i don't think it was both
 
06:43:43.990 --> 06:43:44.000 align:start position:0%
602 is definitely we have to continue
 
06:43:48.070 --> 06:43:48.080 align:start position:0%
then i listed it wrong in the um house
 
06:43:48.080 --> 06:43:49.270 align:start position:0%
then i listed it wrong in the um house
journal

06:43:49.270 --> 06:43:49.280 align:start position:0%
journal
 
06:43:52.390 --> 06:43:52.400 align:start position:0%
i listed 601 as continued public hearing
 
06:43:55.030 --> 06:43:55.040 align:start position:0%
and they even typed it wrong so
 
06:43:57.350 --> 06:43:57.360 align:start position:0%
maybe it washes out um
 
06:43:59.110 --> 06:43:59.120 align:start position:0%
we will also
 
06:43:59.120 --> 06:44:00.468 align:start position:0%
we will also
exact

06:44:00.468 --> 06:44:00.478 align:start position:0%
exact
 
06:44:00.478 --> 06:44:02.628 align:start position:0%
exact
295

06:44:02.628 --> 06:44:02.638 align:start position:0%
295
 
06:44:02.638 --> 06:44:05.230 align:start position:0%
295
503

06:44:05.230 --> 06:44:05.240 align:start position:0%
503
 
06:44:07.830 --> 06:44:07.840 align:start position:0%
146 and i think
 
06:44:11.190 --> 06:44:11.200 align:start position:0%
that will take care of everything
 
06:44:14.070 --> 06:44:14.080 align:start position:0%
so my suggestion is
 
06:44:16.548 --> 06:44:16.558 align:start position:0%
be prepared i'm holding
 
06:44:18.070 --> 06:44:18.080 align:start position:0%
the next
 
06:44:20.788 --> 06:44:20.798 align:start position:0%
that thursday the 11th
 
06:44:23.830 --> 06:44:23.840 align:start position:0%
and we can only do execs on it because
 
06:44:25.910 --> 06:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
i i have nothing to put into the journal
 
06:44:28.230 --> 06:44:28.240 align:start position:0%
but execs can be helped
 
06:44:30.948 --> 06:44:30.958 align:start position:0%
so i hope to get done
 
06:44:34.468 --> 06:44:34.478 align:start position:0%
monday yeah what you're snoring oh yeah
 
06:44:40.628 --> 06:44:40.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:43.030 --> 06:44:43.040 align:start position:0%
with respect to procedure i'm a little
 
06:44:43.040 --> 06:44:44.310 align:start position:0%
with respect to procedure i'm a little
confused

06:44:44.310 --> 06:44:44.320 align:start position:0%
confused
 
06:44:44.320 --> 06:44:45.510 align:start position:0%
confused
um

06:44:45.510 --> 06:44:45.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:44:50.310 --> 06:44:50.320 align:start position:0%
if if we have a continued hearing
 
06:44:52.628 --> 06:44:52.638 align:start position:0%
that has i think that has to go into the
 
06:44:54.628 --> 06:44:54.638 align:start position:0%
calendar so if it's gotten in wrong we
 
06:44:56.150 --> 06:44:56.160 align:start position:0%
need to fix it
 
06:44:58.708 --> 06:44:58.718 align:start position:0%
that's item number one
 
06:45:00.628 --> 06:45:00.638 align:start position:0%
let me let me address that before item
 
06:45:01.830 --> 06:45:01.840 align:start position:0%
number next
 
06:45:04.948 --> 06:45:04.958 align:start position:0%
um since this is on monday the calendar
 
06:45:07.510 --> 06:45:07.520 align:start position:0%
that has been printed is the last
 
06:45:10.548 --> 06:45:10.558 align:start position:0%
calendar that will give legal notice for
 
06:45:10.558 --> 06:45:11.670 align:start position:0%
calendar that will give legal notice for
monday

06:45:11.670 --> 06:45:11.680 align:start position:0%
monday
 
06:45:14.708 --> 06:45:14.718 align:start position:0%
and what i have is continued on 602
 
06:45:18.708 --> 06:45:18.718 align:start position:0%
continued on 103 but i put in continued
 
06:45:21.430 --> 06:45:21.440 align:start position:0%
public hearing on 601. that was a
 
06:45:21.440 --> 06:45:23.030 align:start position:0%
public hearing on 601. that was a
mistake

06:45:23.030 --> 06:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
mistake
 
06:45:25.270 --> 06:45:25.280 align:start position:0%
i just urge you then to consult with the
 
06:45:26.628 --> 06:45:26.638 align:start position:0%
clerk about that
 
06:45:31.510 --> 06:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:34.310 --> 06:45:34.320 align:start position:0%
what i did in the past and it seemed to
 
06:45:37.270 --> 06:45:37.280 align:start position:0%
have passed muster
 
06:45:40.310 --> 06:45:40.320 align:start position:0%
was once you have noticed all of the
 
06:45:42.390 --> 06:45:42.400 align:start position:0%
executive sessions
 
06:45:45.510 --> 06:45:45.520 align:start position:0%
and however much i object to it you have
 
06:45:47.430 --> 06:45:47.440 align:start position:0%
already noticed all of them because
 
06:45:49.030 --> 06:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
you've said that anything that's ready
 
06:45:53.110 --> 06:45:53.120 align:start position:0%
for executive session can be exact
 
06:45:56.628 --> 06:45:56.638 align:start position:0%
i i think the thing to do is to
 
06:45:59.190 --> 06:45:59.200 align:start position:0%
simply notice for the thursday is
 
06:46:01.910 --> 06:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
continued executive session if needed
 
06:46:04.948 --> 06:46:04.958 align:start position:0%
and certainly i i did that regularly
 
06:46:06.230 --> 06:46:06.240 align:start position:0%
last time
 
06:46:08.468 --> 06:46:08.478 align:start position:0%
when it was unclear to me whether we
 
06:46:09.910 --> 06:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
were going to get through our work or
 
06:46:11.590 --> 06:46:11.600 align:start position:0%
not get through our work i mean you
 
06:46:13.350 --> 06:46:13.360 align:start position:0%
can't tell before the calendar is
 
06:46:13.360 --> 06:46:14.708 align:start position:0%
can't tell before the calendar is
published

06:46:14.708 --> 06:46:14.718 align:start position:0%
published
 
06:46:16.948 --> 06:46:16.958 align:start position:0%
thank you for that that's very helpful
 
06:46:19.590 --> 06:46:19.600 align:start position:0%
so i hope that that's of of assistance
 
06:46:21.510 --> 06:46:21.520 align:start position:0%
but you know continuing
 
06:46:23.590 --> 06:46:23.600 align:start position:0%
executive session on all remaining bills
 
06:46:24.948 --> 06:46:24.958 align:start position:0%
i think is
 
06:46:24.958 --> 06:46:25.830 align:start position:0%
i think is
um

06:46:25.830 --> 06:46:25.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:46:27.590 --> 06:46:27.600 align:start position:0%
given that we're accepting that kind of
 
06:46:28.948 --> 06:46:28.958 align:start position:0%
notice i mean it's a lot easier to
 
06:46:31.830 --> 06:46:31.840 align:start position:0%
figure out what hasn't been done at that
 
06:46:34.070 --> 06:46:34.080 align:start position:0%
point sure
 
06:46:36.548 --> 06:46:36.558 align:start position:0%
any other questions about monday
 
06:46:39.510 --> 06:46:39.520 align:start position:0%
schedule going forward yes okay six
 
06:46:41.190 --> 06:46:41.200 align:start position:0%
everyone's the hearing i've already
 
06:46:43.350 --> 06:46:43.360 align:start position:0%
closed our time together so
 
06:46:47.030 --> 06:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:48.310 --> 06:46:48.320 align:start position:0%
i just thought we were going to get
 
06:46:48.320 --> 06:46:49.510 align:start position:0%
i just thought we were going to get
another

06:46:49.510 --> 06:46:49.520 align:start position:0%
another
 
06:46:49.520 --> 06:46:50.868 align:start position:0%
another
another

06:46:50.868 --> 06:46:50.878 align:start position:0%
another
