lucky are so lucky
 
00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:23.680 align:start position:0%
um I come forward to ask you to consider
 
00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:24.800 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.120 align:start position:0%
285 it's on the surface um a simple
 
00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:30.280 align:start position:0%
clarification it's not even a
 
00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:32.919 align:start position:0%
clarification it just adds words to
 
00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:35.160 align:start position:0%
remind judges to make sure that they're
 
00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:36.800 align:start position:0%
looking at a full environment for
 
00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:41.000 align:start position:0%
children and it asks judges to look at
 
00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:45.400 align:start position:0%
as another Factor any known mental
 
00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:47.560 align:start position:0%
health um conditions that could
 
00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:51.400 align:start position:0%
interfere with parenting in no way am I
 
00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:53.600 align:start position:0%
advocating for judges to ask for private
 
00:05:56.629 --> 00:05:56.639 align:start position:0%
information or to disclose counseling or
 
00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:00.400 align:start position:0%
to um give over medical record records
 
00:06:04.189 --> 00:06:04.199 align:start position:0%
however for a judge to truly make a
 
00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:06.240 align:start position:0%
determination in the best interest of
 
00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:08.360 align:start position:0%
the child they need to understand the
 
00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:11.400 align:start position:0%
Full Ecology um and environment of the
 
00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:12.390 align:start position:0%
Full Ecology um and environment of the
home

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:12.400 align:start position:0%
home
 
00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
situation as we know or many of us know
 
00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:19.919 align:start position:0%
um divorce is one of the biggest
 
00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:22.440 align:start position:0%
stressors that a person
 
00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:24.880 align:start position:0%
can um have in their
 
00:06:27.589 --> 00:06:27.599 align:start position:0%
lifetime and that includes the custody
 
00:06:30.309 --> 00:06:30.319 align:start position:0%
determinations it includes ch es often
 
00:06:32.469 --> 00:06:32.479 align:start position:0%
of employment households I mean these
 
00:06:34.469 --> 00:06:34.479 align:start position:0%
are the biggest stressors that we face
 
00:06:34.479 --> 00:06:35.469 align:start position:0%
are the biggest stressors that we face
as

00:06:35.469 --> 00:06:35.479 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:06:38.749 --> 00:06:38.759 align:start position:0%
adults when you look at that and then
 
00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:42.840 align:start position:0%
you compound that with one or both of
 
00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:45.080 align:start position:0%
the parents having a known mental health
 
00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:47.240 align:start position:0%
or even a medical condition that could
 
00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:50.560 align:start position:0%
be aggravated by this stressor the judge
 
00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:53.360 align:start position:0%
needs to be made aware of that and again
 
00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:55.800 align:start position:0%
not looking to take children from
 
00:06:58.189 --> 00:06:58.199 align:start position:0%
parents I'm looking to assure that the
 
00:07:00.629 --> 00:07:00.639 align:start position:0%
children have a safe safe healthy
 
00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:03.360 align:start position:0%
environment to go to when parents are
 
00:07:05.869 --> 00:07:05.879 align:start position:0%
married they are very fortunate that
 
00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:08.520 align:start position:0%
they have each other to pick up the
 
00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:11.440 align:start position:0%
slack if one is not feeling well or one
 
00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:15.000 align:start position:0%
is having um any kind of a mental or a
 
00:07:18.309 --> 00:07:18.319 align:start position:0%
medical crisis they have a support
 
00:07:21.469 --> 00:07:21.479 align:start position:0%
system but after the divorce these
 
00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:24.560 align:start position:0%
systems can fall apart especially if the
 
00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:26.120 align:start position:0%
divorce is not
 
00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
amicable then we're sending home
 
00:07:30.309 --> 00:07:30.319 align:start position:0%
children to home environment ments that
 
00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:32.520 align:start position:0%
may not be in their best interest these
 
00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:34.360 align:start position:0%
are young children now who have to
 
00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:37.000 align:start position:0%
navigate a home
 
00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:40.000 align:start position:0%
environment sometimes by acting like the
 
00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:43.400 align:start position:0%
other parent and helping the the parent
 
00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:46.440 align:start position:0%
they're with at that time to be able to
 
00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:49.800 align:start position:0%
function again I cannot stress enough I
 
00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:52.360 align:start position:0%
am not looking for private information I
 
00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:54.120 align:start position:0%
am not saying the judge I would hope our
 
00:07:57.390 --> 00:07:57.400 align:start position:0%
judges would be well informed not to ask
 
00:08:01.029 --> 00:08:01.039 align:start position:0%
for any personal invit um information
 
00:08:03.309 --> 00:08:03.319 align:start position:0%
from the parents but simply ask a
 
00:08:05.309 --> 00:08:05.319 align:start position:0%
question is there
 
00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
anything that I should know when I make
 
00:08:11.149 --> 00:08:11.159 align:start position:0%
a determination on parenting and that
 
00:08:15.469 --> 00:08:15.479 align:start position:0%
could be as simple as and this might not
 
00:08:16.869 --> 00:08:16.879 align:start position:0%
be the right thing to say but I'll say
 
00:08:18.749 --> 00:08:18.759 align:start position:0%
it it could be as simple as
 
00:08:21.309 --> 00:08:21.319 align:start position:0%
understanding that the parent um needs
 
00:08:23.469 --> 00:08:23.479 align:start position:0%
to continue in counseling or needs to be
 
00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:26.120 align:start position:0%
on medication or needs and that is up to
 
00:08:28.469 --> 00:08:28.479 align:start position:0%
the parent to if they want to provide
 
00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
that but the the judge needs to to know
 
00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
this um in order to assure the safety of
 
00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:37.550 align:start position:0%
this um in order to assure the safety of
the

00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:37.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:41.589 --> 00:08:41.599 align:start position:0%
child and I'm open to taking questions
 
00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:45.240 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I'm running here so late and
 
00:08:46.949 --> 00:08:46.959 align:start position:0%
um so I'm a little
 
00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:49.480 align:start position:0%
discombobulated well we hope you will be
 
00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:53.000 align:start position:0%
combobulated thank you I think so um
 
00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:55.240 align:start position:0%
would you believe that in almost 50
 
00:08:58.430 --> 00:08:58.440 align:start position:0%
years of uh being a clergy member I've
 
00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:01.240 align:start position:0%
had numbers of of families where there
 
00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:04.320 align:start position:0%
were mental health issues but that did
 
00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:09.160 align:start position:0%
not necessarily impact their ability to
 
00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:13.200 align:start position:0%
parent well that I would put there there
 
00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:16.640 align:start position:0%
being somewhat of a spectrum of ability
 
00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:20.360 align:start position:0%
and inability mental health issues by
 
00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:23.640 align:start position:0%
themselves not being a determinative
 
00:09:26.829 --> 00:09:26.839 align:start position:0%
would you believe I would absolutely um
 
00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:29.000 align:start position:0%
believe that and agree with that I think
 
00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:29.870 align:start position:0%
believe that and agree with that I think
that

00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:29.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:33.360 align:start position:0%
this um what we're adding in would be
 
00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:35.320 align:start position:0%
adding into this bill would just provide
 
00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:37.800 align:start position:0%
the opportunity for a judge to ask a
 
00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:40.720 align:start position:0%
question no more than that um I
 
00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
certainly um know
 
00:09:46.829 --> 00:09:46.839 align:start position:0%
of many people who may have challenges
 
00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
medical physical emotional challenges
 
00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:52.160 align:start position:0%
who are very good parents and I'm not
 
00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:54.040 align:start position:0%
trying to sit here and say that just
 
00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
because you have challenges in your life
 
00:09:57.710 --> 00:09:57.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean you can't
 
00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:01.360 align:start position:0%
parent but if those challenges do
 
00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
interfere then we need to have a
 
00:10:05.829 --> 00:10:05.839 align:start position:0%
mechanism to make sure that the judge
 
00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:08.360 align:start position:0%
knows that and so that he can make an
 
00:10:11.509 --> 00:10:11.519 align:start position:0%
appropriate um decision as far as the
 
00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
best interest of the child and would you
 
00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:17.200 align:start position:0%
further believe that since this as you
 
00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
describe it is simply reminder the
 
00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:23.240 align:start position:0%
extremely well-crafted amendment that I
 
00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:26.360 align:start position:0%
have in my hand um would spells that out
 
00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:29.320 align:start position:0%
exactly to say that mental medical or
 
00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:31.720 align:start position:0%
mental health condition that could
 
00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:34.680 align:start position:0%
aversely affect a person's ability to
 
00:10:37.829 --> 00:10:37.839 align:start position:0%
parent is a further yet further reminder
 
00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:41.480 align:start position:0%
to a judge what he or she already knows
 
00:10:43.629 --> 00:10:43.639 align:start position:0%
I would definitely agree with that any
 
00:10:43.639 --> 00:10:44.629 align:start position:0%
I would definitely agree with that any
other

00:10:44.629 --> 00:10:44.639 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:47.800 align:start position:0%
questions representative Raymond uh
 
00:10:49.269 --> 00:10:49.279 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
00:10:50.629 --> 00:10:50.639 align:start position:0%
representative ball for coming back to
 
00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:55.000 align:start position:0%
our committee um so my question is about
 
00:10:57.790 --> 00:10:57.800 align:start position:0%
um the the whole passage that you're
 
00:11:03.269 --> 00:11:03.279 align:start position:0%
quoting 461 A6 has a through M and so a
 
00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
is that the judge has to consider I'm
 
00:11:11.069 --> 00:11:11.079 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry B and C uh B A says that the
 
00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:12.560 align:start position:0%
judge has to consider the ability of
 
00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:15.000 align:start position:0%
each parent to provide the child with
 
00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:17.000 align:start position:0%
nurture love affection and guidance and
 
00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:19.000 align:start position:0%
B is the ability of each parent to
 
00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
assure the child receives adequate food
 
00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:23.160 align:start position:0%
clothing shelter Medical Care and a safe
 
00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:26.760 align:start position:0%
environment and so my question is why
 
00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:29.680 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that um prescription the
 
00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
prescriptions that the judge already
 
00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
consider the parents ability to provide
 
00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:36.760 align:start position:0%
these things for the children not cause
 
00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:38.720 align:start position:0%
the judge to look at things that would
 
00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:40.480 align:start position:0%
interfere with their ability like I
 
00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:43.880 align:start position:0%
guess I'm I'm confused about how this
 
00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:48.120 align:start position:0%
language um increases the focus on the
 
00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:49.880 align:start position:0%
best interest of the child as opposed to
 
00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
looking for reasons why a parent
 
00:11:54.069 --> 00:11:54.079 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to
 
00:11:57.110 --> 00:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
parent thank you for your question I
 
00:11:59.829 --> 00:11:59.839 align:start position:0%
believe that many of us are are aware of
 
00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:02.200 align:start position:0%
the revolving door in family court with
 
00:12:03.829 --> 00:12:03.839 align:start position:0%
the judges and even though we are
 
00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
supposed to have one family one judge it
 
00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:08.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't happen and there are people that
 
00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:11.360 align:start position:0%
have certain mental illnesses who can
 
00:12:13.949 --> 00:12:13.959 align:start position:0%
present themselves as
 
00:12:18.389 --> 00:12:18.399 align:start position:0%
very um thoughtful caring parents they
 
00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:21.160 align:start position:0%
can present that once but then when they
 
00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:22.880 align:start position:0%
come back to the court the next time and
 
00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:24.440 align:start position:0%
the next time and the next time the
 
00:12:25.949 --> 00:12:25.959 align:start position:0%
judge starts saying a pattern of
 
00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:27.720 align:start position:0%
behavior that indicates there could be a
 
00:12:30.829 --> 00:12:30.839 align:start position:0%
mental health issue um happening here
 
00:12:32.629 --> 00:12:32.639 align:start position:0%
but since we don't always have the same
 
00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:35.240 align:start position:0%
judge a judge is not aware of that and a
 
00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
person wouldn't present that way and the
 
00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:41.720 align:start position:0%
other parent is not allowed to present
 
00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:44.560 align:start position:0%
any evidence in court and so therefore
 
00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:46.920 align:start position:0%
how do you get this information to the
 
00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
judge unless the judge can actually ask
 
00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:50.990 align:start position:0%
judge unless the judge can actually ask
the

00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:51.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:54.160 align:start position:0%
question followup thank you Mr chairman
 
00:12:57.350 --> 00:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
so what about those parents who clearly
 
00:12:59.509 --> 00:12:59.519 align:start position:0%
have mental health issues but have
 
00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:01.320 align:start position:0%
chosen not to seek mental health
 
00:13:03.829 --> 00:13:03.839 align:start position:0%
counseling or a diagnosis for themselves
 
00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:06.600 align:start position:0%
how does a judge determine that based on
 
00:13:10.949 --> 00:13:10.959 align:start position:0%
this language well it's my understanding
 
00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:13.680 align:start position:0%
um that the judge can order
 
00:13:17.949 --> 00:13:17.959 align:start position:0%
psychological evaluations if he sees fit
 
00:13:20.629 --> 00:13:20.639 align:start position:0%
um but this would open the door for him
 
00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
to ask the question and determine
 
00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:25.680 align:start position:0%
whether or not something should be uh
 
00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:28.120 align:start position:0%
looked at more closely I think it also
 
00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
opens the door for the the other parent
 
00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:33.440 align:start position:0%
to provide testimony um and evidence
 
00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
that may indicate that the parent um may
 
00:13:40.069 --> 00:13:40.079 align:start position:0%
have lapses in their ability to parent
 
00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:42.920 align:start position:0%
their child again not meaning that that
 
00:13:44.629 --> 00:13:44.639 align:start position:0%
parent should not have custody of that
 
00:13:47.509 --> 00:13:47.519 align:start position:0%
child but that just that there may need
 
00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
to be guard rails put into place to
 
00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:52.360 align:start position:0%
assure that that parent um is seeking
 
00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:54.040 align:start position:0%
the help that they need in order to be
 
00:14:00.829 --> 00:14:00.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:00.839 --> 00:14:01.990 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:02.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:04.240 align:start position:0%
Greg thank you Mr chairman I was
 
00:14:05.269 --> 00:14:05.279 align:start position:0%
wondering if I was going to get called
 
00:14:07.710 --> 00:14:07.720 align:start position:0%
on there for a second uh and thank you
 
00:14:09.829 --> 00:14:09.839 align:start position:0%
and I will echo my uh the sentiments
 
00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:11.880 align:start position:0%
from our other colleague it's nice to
 
00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:13.880 align:start position:0%
see you back in here again um my
 
00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:15.880 align:start position:0%
question is understanding the
 
00:14:18.069 --> 00:14:18.079 align:start position:0%
weaponization in these high conflict
 
00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:21.240 align:start position:0%
cases of stuff like mental health and
 
00:14:23.949 --> 00:14:23.959 align:start position:0%
you know how that works how is this to
 
00:14:25.829 --> 00:14:25.839 align:start position:0%
be known because there are a lot of
 
00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:28.320 align:start position:0%
accusations in high conflict cases of
 
00:14:31.389 --> 00:14:31.399 align:start position:0%
even in abuse cases of oh well this
 
00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:33.800 align:start position:0%
person isn't unfit or that they're unfit
 
00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:35.320 align:start position:0%
because maybe they were depressed while
 
00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
going through that or whatever else but
 
00:14:39.949 --> 00:14:39.959 align:start position:0%
I just am confused as to what the basis
 
00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:43.320 align:start position:0%
is on how it would be known
 
00:14:44.749 --> 00:14:44.759 align:start position:0%
understanding that that becomes very
 
00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:47.320 align:start position:0%
weaponized in court thank you for your
 
00:14:48.949 --> 00:14:48.959 align:start position:0%
question and it's interesting that you
 
00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
bring up the weaponization within family
 
00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:53.560 align:start position:0%
court because that is one of the biggest
 
00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
challenges in family court and it
 
00:14:58.670 --> 00:14:58.680 align:start position:0%
happens before Family Court when systems
 
00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:01.160 align:start position:0%
are weaponized like making false
 
00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:03.680 align:start position:0%
allegations against another parent and
 
00:15:05.749 --> 00:15:05.759 align:start position:0%
those allegations can often be made by
 
00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:08.320 align:start position:0%
the parent who actually has the uh
 
00:15:10.509 --> 00:15:10.519 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Challenge and so they're
 
00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:11.880 align:start position:0%
not looking to look for the best
 
00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:13.160 align:start position:0%
interest of their child they're looking
 
00:15:15.629 --> 00:15:15.639 align:start position:0%
to win at all costs that is part of
 
00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:19.800 align:start position:0%
their um mental health disorder or
 
00:15:22.829 --> 00:15:22.839 align:start position:0%
challenge um saying that this would
 
00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:25.320 align:start position:0%
weaponize it I think it actually takes
 
00:15:28.189 --> 00:15:28.199 align:start position:0%
that weapon away from weaponizing it
 
00:15:31.509 --> 00:15:31.519 align:start position:0%
within the family cour because you can't
 
00:15:34.509 --> 00:15:34.519 align:start position:0%
weaponize something if it doesn't exist
 
00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:37.240 align:start position:0%
and if the
 
00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:40.000 align:start position:0%
person you know it you have to look at
 
00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:42.360 align:start position:0%
the whole dynamic and I think by asking
 
00:15:45.389 --> 00:15:45.399 align:start position:0%
the question is what disarms both
 
00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
parents from weaponizing the parent the
 
00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:50.600 align:start position:0%
uh family court because it is now put
 
00:15:52.509 --> 00:15:52.519 align:start position:0%
right out there we can't hide behind
 
00:15:54.670 --> 00:15:54.680 align:start position:0%
anything we can't make false allegations
 
00:15:57.230 --> 00:15:57.240 align:start position:0%
we can't just do things in Family Court
 
00:15:59.509 --> 00:15:59.519 align:start position:0%
to try and get the result
 
00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:02.160 align:start position:0%
that we want and I think that this helps
 
00:16:03.269 --> 00:16:03.279 align:start position:0%
the judge
 
00:16:06.309 --> 00:16:06.319 align:start position:0%
determine where the truth is in
 
00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:08.480 align:start position:0%
determining where the best interest of
 
00:16:09.629 --> 00:16:09.639 align:start position:0%
the child
 
00:16:12.509 --> 00:16:12.519 align:start position:0%
lies followup and is there something
 
00:16:14.430 --> 00:16:14.440 align:start position:0%
right now that is keeping the judge from
 
00:16:17.189 --> 00:16:17.199 align:start position:0%
being able to weigh on this at
 
00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:20.480 align:start position:0%
all well when I spoke to uh
 
00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:23.000 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn when I wrote this up
 
00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:26.560 align:start position:0%
um and he was a superior court judge
 
00:16:28.949 --> 00:16:28.959 align:start position:0%
suprem higher Supreme Court judge so I
 
00:16:31.269 --> 00:16:31.279 align:start position:0%
did run this by him and his response to
 
00:16:34.269 --> 00:16:34.279 align:start position:0%
me was there is no problem with a judge
 
00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
asking a question my concern is the I
 
00:16:41.629 --> 00:16:41.639 align:start position:0%
would like to see that there because my
 
00:16:43.269 --> 00:16:43.279 align:start position:0%
experience is and hearing from my
 
00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:46.000 align:start position:0%
constituents is the judges do not ask
 
00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:48.680 align:start position:0%
the question that that is never put out
 
00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
there there is never an opportunity to
 
00:16:54.910 --> 00:16:54.920 align:start position:0%
um share the whole um home environment
 
00:16:57.350 --> 00:16:57.360 align:start position:0%
with the judge as I said in Family Court
 
00:16:59.430 --> 00:16:59.440 align:start position:0%
you can't provide any evidence so even
 
00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:03.160 align:start position:0%
if the other parent has evidence that
 
00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:06.480 align:start position:0%
this parent may not I I love my ex like
 
00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:09.520 align:start position:0%
my soon to be ex I love that person but
 
00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:11.480 align:start position:0%
the person may not have the wherewithal
 
00:17:14.309 --> 00:17:14.319 align:start position:0%
by themselves to be able to parent um in
 
00:17:16.350 --> 00:17:16.360 align:start position:0%
a in the best possible manner in the
 
00:17:18.189 --> 00:17:18.199 align:start position:0%
best interest of the child and I'm not
 
00:17:21.590 --> 00:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
looking to keep my child from them but I
 
00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
need to be assured that that parent is
 
00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:25.760 align:start position:0%
going to get what they need to help them
 
00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:27.760 align:start position:0%
be the best possible parent that's what
 
00:17:29.549 --> 00:17:29.559 align:start position:0%
I'm hoping this will do is allow the
 
00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:33.000 align:start position:0%
judge to maneuver his way through this
 
00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:36.080 align:start position:0%
web and and determine what is in the
 
00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:38.640 align:start position:0%
best interest of children and how do we
 
00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:41.000 align:start position:0%
best meet the parents of both parents as
 
00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
you know I was a huge advocate for
 
00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:45.240 align:start position:0%
approximately equal parenting time so I
 
00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:48.720 align:start position:0%
am no way am looking to lessen the
 
00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:50.280 align:start position:0%
amount of time a child spends with a
 
00:17:52.909 --> 00:17:52.919 align:start position:0%
parent what I am looking to do is
 
00:17:57.710 --> 00:17:57.720 align:start position:0%
provide a mechanism for judges to um
 
00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:00.240 align:start position:0%
have the guard rails put in place to
 
00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:03.880 align:start position:0%
assure that the child is the
 
00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:05.960 align:start position:0%
determinations are in always in the best
 
00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:08.480 align:start position:0%
interest of the
 
00:18:11.310 --> 00:18:11.320 align:start position:0%
child representative
 
00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:13.880 align:start position:0%
love thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:16.360 align:start position:0%
taking my question um you mentioned that
 
00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
uh you know the revolving judge thing
 
00:18:20.110 --> 00:18:20.120 align:start position:0%
and I I I think it's got a lot to do
 
00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:21.880 align:start position:0%
with burnout myself these are tough
 
00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
cases and uh they must have a tough time
 
00:18:28.549 --> 00:18:28.559 align:start position:0%
but anyway um in your bill here uh do
 
00:18:31.549 --> 00:18:31.559 align:start position:0%
you think it might be uh advantageous to
 
00:18:34.110 --> 00:18:34.120 align:start position:0%
amend it to to have direct instruction
 
00:18:36.669 --> 00:18:36.679 align:start position:0%
for the judge to ask these
 
00:18:39.190 --> 00:18:39.200 align:start position:0%
questions well I think um thank you for
 
00:18:41.230 --> 00:18:41.240 align:start position:0%
the CH the
 
00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:43.320 align:start position:0%
question I think just putting the
 
00:18:45.549 --> 00:18:45.559 align:start position:0%
reminder there to the judge that that is
 
00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:48.400 align:start position:0%
another factor that they should consider
 
00:18:50.149 --> 00:18:50.159 align:start position:0%
um I don't think they have to be
 
00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
directed to do it if they don't um I
 
00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:56.400 align:start position:0%
trust our judges uh to do what is right
 
00:18:57.950 --> 00:18:57.960 align:start position:0%
and to ask the questions that are
 
00:19:00.669 --> 00:19:00.679 align:start position:0%
appropriate this would only serve as a
 
00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
reminder that we are looking at the
 
00:19:05.549 --> 00:19:05.559 align:start position:0%
whole picture and not just these little
 
00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:08.520 align:start position:0%
parts of the picture thank
 
00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:19:14.110 --> 00:19:14.120 align:start position:0%
Sher thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:19:17.789 --> 00:19:17.799 align:start position:0%
for uh your uh what you've said so far
 
00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:21.960 align:start position:0%
I'm a little uh I think I'm beginning to
 
00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:24.640 align:start position:0%
understand what is it my understanding
 
00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:28.240 align:start position:0%
that judges could ask questions about
 
00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:31.280 align:start position:0%
known mental health conditions now but
 
00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:32.430 align:start position:0%
known mental health conditions now but
they

00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:32.440 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:35.400 align:start position:0%
don't is that what you're saying well
 
00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:38.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question my experience
 
00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:41.400 align:start position:0%
from watching The Family Court um and
 
00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:43.280 align:start position:0%
from the input that I'm receiving from
 
00:19:45.789 --> 00:19:45.799 align:start position:0%
my constituents is that the judges do
 
00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:48.320 align:start position:0%
not ask and there is no opportunity for
 
00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:50.720 align:start position:0%
them to present any evidence that a
 
00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
parent may need to have some guidelines
 
00:19:56.909 --> 00:19:56.919 align:start position:0%
or um guardrails put into the parenting
 
00:19:58.710 --> 00:19:58.720 align:start position:0%
plan to ensure that that parent can
 
00:20:01.789 --> 00:20:01.799 align:start position:0%
continues to receive the adequate um or
 
00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:05.240 align:start position:0%
the necessary care to parent effectively
 
00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:09.400 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you um uh I'm not Fami
 
00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:13.600 align:start position:0%
very familiar with family court but
 
00:20:18.270 --> 00:20:18.280 align:start position:0%
um is isn't it the case that one of the
 
00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:22.120 align:start position:0%
parties if they so choose could say I'm
 
00:20:25.149 --> 00:20:25.159 align:start position:0%
concerned about my child spending so
 
00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
much time with this parent who I believe
 
00:20:30.510 --> 00:20:30.520 align:start position:0%
has a mental illness can't they already
 
00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:31.950 align:start position:0%
has a mental illness can't they already
say

00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:31.960 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:35.440 align:start position:0%
that thank you for the child the uh the
 
00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:39.000 align:start position:0%
parent my experience has been um that
 
00:20:40.590 --> 00:20:40.600 align:start position:0%
although that is supposed to be taken
 
00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:42.520 align:start position:0%
into consideration the parent cannot
 
00:20:43.950 --> 00:20:43.960 align:start position:0%
bring it up because then they would be
 
00:20:46.149 --> 00:20:46.159 align:start position:0%
presenting evidence again and they would
 
00:20:47.549 --> 00:20:47.559 align:start position:0%
have to show they can't just make an
 
00:20:49.669 --> 00:20:49.679 align:start position:0%
allegation in the court and even if they
 
00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:51.720 align:start position:0%
had the evidence they can't provide it
 
00:20:53.789 --> 00:20:53.799 align:start position:0%
unless the other parent is on the stand
 
00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:55.840 align:start position:0%
and opens the door for that evidence to
 
00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:00.600 align:start position:0%
come in for instance um in the I mean we
 
00:21:02.590 --> 00:21:02.600 align:start position:0%
we went last year and we watched many
 
00:21:05.789 --> 00:21:05.799 align:start position:0%
cases um but in and then my constituents
 
00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
as I said and from what I'm hearing is
 
00:21:10.190 --> 00:21:10.200 align:start position:0%
that unless the parent on the stand
 
00:21:12.950 --> 00:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
brings something up
 
00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:17.080 align:start position:0%
um the question can't be made um so if a
 
00:21:19.549 --> 00:21:19.559 align:start position:0%
if a parent was to bring up I don't know
 
00:21:21.789 --> 00:21:21.799 align:start position:0%
I'll just give a for instance they
 
00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:22.840 align:start position:0%
happen to
 
00:21:25.909 --> 00:21:25.919 align:start position:0%
mention Facebook well that's an
 
00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:28.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity for the other lawyer to say
 
00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:30.400 align:start position:0%
oh you mentioned Facebook gez have you
 
00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:32.520 align:start position:0%
seen what's posted on Facebook and
 
00:21:33.950 --> 00:21:33.960 align:start position:0%
that's how you open it but that lawyer
 
00:21:36.269 --> 00:21:36.279 align:start position:0%
could not just say did you post these on
 
00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:38.320 align:start position:0%
Facebook they have to wait for the door
 
00:21:40.789 --> 00:21:40.799 align:start position:0%
to be opened in order to get that
 
00:21:44.190 --> 00:21:44.200 align:start position:0%
information in that's has been my
 
00:21:45.269 --> 00:21:45.279 align:start position:0%
understanding that's what I'm hearing
 
00:21:47.950 --> 00:21:47.960 align:start position:0%
from many constituents and that I'm just
 
00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:50.200 align:start position:0%
pulling that out of the top of my head
 
00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:51.789 align:start position:0%
pulling that out of the top of my head
but

00:21:51.789 --> 00:21:51.799 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:21:54.350 --> 00:21:54.360 align:start position:0%
um does that answer your question I'm
 
00:21:59.110 --> 00:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
sorry uh close enough I think I'm okay
 
00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
uh I I do I don't know enough about
 
00:22:04.510 --> 00:22:04.520 align:start position:0%
family well let me remind you or fill
 
00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:06.880 align:start position:0%
you in on what we found out last year or
 
00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:10.440 align:start position:0%
the last two terms 80% of the uh parents
 
00:22:12.750 --> 00:22:12.760 align:start position:0%
that are in Family Court are
 
00:22:14.909 --> 00:22:14.919 align:start position:0%
prosay so they don't have the
 
00:22:16.590 --> 00:22:16.600 align:start position:0%
wherewithal to know how to get this
 
00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:19.200 align:start position:0%
information to the judge and so the
 
00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:23.120 align:start position:0%
judge needs to kind of steer the um the
 
00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:25.000 align:start position:0%
case and the court into the direction to
 
00:22:26.669 --> 00:22:26.679 align:start position:0%
make sure he gets all the information he
 
00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:29.360 align:start position:0%
needs to make an absolute education best
 
00:22:31.230 --> 00:22:31.240 align:start position:0%
decision for the best interest of the
 
00:22:34.830 --> 00:22:34.840 align:start position:0%
child and for those other 20% those are
 
00:22:37.029 --> 00:22:37.039 align:start position:0%
typically um I won't say typically
 
00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
because maybe that's not the case but
 
00:22:41.630 --> 00:22:41.640 align:start position:0%
they have attorneys who know how to
 
00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:43.840 align:start position:0%
maneuver the family court and know how
 
00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
to get evidence in and know how to get
 
00:22:49.149 --> 00:22:49.159 align:start position:0%
this information before the judge my
 
00:22:52.230 --> 00:22:52.240 align:start position:0%
concern is on those other 80% and maybe
 
00:22:54.669 --> 00:22:54.679 align:start position:0%
there they might be the 80% that don't M
 
00:22:57.029 --> 00:22:57.039 align:start position:0%
matter maybe it's just the 20% of high
 
00:22:59.510 --> 00:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
volatile cases that really need to have
 
00:23:01.789 --> 00:23:01.799 align:start position:0%
this brought forward but we never seem
 
00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:04.240 align:start position:0%
to be able to get it there and that's
 
00:23:06.149 --> 00:23:06.159 align:start position:0%
what I'm trying to make sure that the
 
00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:08.320 align:start position:0%
judge actually has something in writing
 
00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
that says I'm allowed to ask this
 
00:23:12.029 --> 00:23:12.039 align:start position:0%
question I'm not going to ask you for
 
00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
any of your medical records I'm not
 
00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
going to ask you for your counseling
 
00:23:17.149 --> 00:23:17.159 align:start position:0%
records all I want to know is there
 
00:23:18.830 --> 00:23:18.840 align:start position:0%
anything I should be aware of that might
 
00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:21.440 align:start position:0%
interfere with your ability to parent
 
00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:23.870 align:start position:0%
interfere with your ability to parent
thank

00:23:23.870 --> 00:23:23.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:27.320 align:start position:0%

ask a question but um I think so you
 
00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:40.080 align:start position:0%

00:23:43.149 --> 00:23:43.159 align:start position:0%
for kids uh I've been there and I
 
00:23:45.269 --> 00:23:45.279 align:start position:0%

00:23:49.230 --> 00:23:49.240 align:start position:0%
to understand for parent for to be um
 
00:23:50.830 --> 00:23:50.840 align:start position:0%

00:23:53.669 --> 00:23:53.679 align:start position:0%
mental health thank you anyone else
 
00:23:53.679 --> 00:23:56.350 align:start position:0%

final

00:23:56.350 --> 00:23:56.360 align:start position:0%
final
 
00:24:01.669 --> 00:24:01.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:05.720 align:start position:0%
taking the question representative ball
 
00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:07.190 align:start position:0%
taking the question representative ball
uh

00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:07.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:24:10.470 --> 00:24:10.480 align:start position:0%
to add on a a previous comment from one
 
00:24:13.310 --> 00:24:13.320 align:start position:0%
of the members um relative to the the
 
00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:15.240 align:start position:0%
judge asking this question in the
 
00:24:16.590 --> 00:24:16.600 align:start position:0%
narrative when it
 
00:24:19.390 --> 00:24:19.400 align:start position:0%
states if the the court deems
 
00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:21.960 align:start position:0%
relevant or de facto the judge could
 
00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:23.880 align:start position:0%
deem it not relevant even before it's
 
00:24:27.149 --> 00:24:27.159 align:start position:0%
even brought up in my interpretation of
 
00:24:30.190 --> 00:24:30.200 align:start position:0%
that should should language not be where
 
00:24:33.029 --> 00:24:33.039 align:start position:0%
it is a requirement uh for lack of a
 
00:24:35.149 --> 00:24:35.159 align:start position:0%
better word that the judge would ask for
 
00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:37.600 align:start position:0%
this type of information and knowing
 
00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:39.440 align:start position:0%
that evidence apparently can't be
 
00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
accepted unless it's um a context is
 
00:24:46.190 --> 00:24:46.200 align:start position:0%
offered within a within a
 
00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:48.240 align:start position:0%
narrative thank you for asking that
 
00:24:50.190 --> 00:24:50.200 align:start position:0%
question I will mention that there are
 
00:24:52.149 --> 00:24:52.159 align:start position:0%
several other states that already have
 
00:24:54.750 --> 00:24:54.760 align:start position:0%
this in their law that it is required to
 
00:24:56.389 --> 00:24:56.399 align:start position:0%
for the judge to take this into
 
00:24:58.909 --> 00:24:58.919 align:start position:0%
consideration and to ask the question
 
00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:01.200 align:start position:0%
um I think the point of then the judge
 
00:25:02.909 --> 00:25:02.919 align:start position:0%
if the judge has that information then
 
00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:04.120 align:start position:0%
they can deem whether or not it's
 
00:25:06.510 --> 00:25:06.520 align:start position:0%
relevant is it going to interfere with
 
00:25:10.149 --> 00:25:10.159 align:start position:0%
the parents ability to parent um but
 
00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
they they can't make that determination
 
00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:14.080 align:start position:0%
if they don't have the information to
 
00:25:17.190 --> 00:25:17.200 align:start position:0%
begin with just follow up follow up
 
00:25:18.830 --> 00:25:18.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh just a follow
 
00:25:20.830 --> 00:25:20.840 align:start position:0%
up on this then it would be the
 
00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
representation outside of a prosay but a
 
00:25:26.789 --> 00:25:26.799 align:start position:0%
representation of the
 
00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:29.440 align:start position:0%
petitioner that
 
00:25:32.029 --> 00:25:32.039 align:start position:0%
this information would be then provided
 
00:25:34.389 --> 00:25:34.399 align:start position:0%
which would then have the judge
 
00:25:37.110 --> 00:25:37.120 align:start position:0%
responding to it that' be the only other
 
00:25:39.669 --> 00:25:39.679 align:start position:0%
alternative because the judge could not
 
00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:42.600 align:start position:0%
could D now just say it's not relevant
 
00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:44.360 align:start position:0%
it doesn't come up in in court the begin
 
00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:46.760 align:start position:0%
with well it's that's an interesting
 
00:25:48.990 --> 00:25:49.000 align:start position:0%
question thank you because it does bring
 
00:25:52.350 --> 00:25:52.360 align:start position:0%
up the the point and as I'm thinking and
 
00:25:54.430 --> 00:25:54.440 align:start position:0%
I thought about it this morning of
 
00:25:57.149 --> 00:25:57.159 align:start position:0%
mandated reporting if the judge ask the
 
00:25:57.159 --> 00:25:58.830 align:start position:0%
mandated reporting if the judge ask the
question

00:25:58.830 --> 00:25:58.840 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:26:01.630 --> 00:26:01.640 align:start position:0%
are the parents then not mandated to
 
00:26:03.950 --> 00:26:03.960 align:start position:0%
report whether or not they have seen
 
00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:07.080 align:start position:0%
situations where um the child was not
 
00:26:10.549 --> 00:26:10.559 align:start position:0%
being parented correctly or in the best
 
00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
interest of the child so this would be
 
00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
something that would have to open the
 
00:26:17.470 --> 00:26:17.480 align:start position:0%
door um and get that information to the
 
00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:20.080 align:start position:0%
judge am I understanding your question
 
00:26:23.549 --> 00:26:23.559 align:start position:0%
correctly I I well it's it's a debating
 
00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:26.080 align:start position:0%
Point okay right now I just just to load
 
00:26:28.389 --> 00:26:28.399 align:start position:0%
to follow up on one of them is is the
 
00:26:31.149 --> 00:26:31.159 align:start position:0%
term relevant is it transfers the
 
00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:33.120 align:start position:0%
responsibility then specifically to the
 
00:26:34.430 --> 00:26:34.440 align:start position:0%
judge to
 
00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:37.480 align:start position:0%
decide whether it's relevant or not
 
00:26:39.789 --> 00:26:39.799 align:start position:0%
unless it's in the narrative to State
 
00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:43.200 align:start position:0%
you shall as as opposed to May uh ask
 
00:26:46.190 --> 00:26:46.200 align:start position:0%
for for this information and to follow
 
00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:48.880 align:start position:0%
your guidance uh the ultimate Authority
 
00:26:50.830 --> 00:26:50.840 align:start position:0%
here is the safety of the of the CH of
 
00:26:53.470 --> 00:26:53.480 align:start position:0%
the children and possibly the other
 
00:26:56.870 --> 00:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
adult as well so that's why I was I was
 
00:26:59.430 --> 00:26:59.440 align:start position:0%
wondering whether um the the relevancy
 
00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
would require an
 
00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:04.000 align:start position:0%
additional uh sentence to State you you
 
00:27:06.630 --> 00:27:06.640 align:start position:0%
shall ask on this subject or there could
 
00:27:08.630 --> 00:27:08.640 align:start position:0%
be others added to
 
00:27:12.430 --> 00:27:12.440 align:start position:0%
it I appreciate your um question when I
 
00:27:15.029 --> 00:27:15.039 align:start position:0%
wrote this it was to try and keep it in
 
00:27:18.029 --> 00:27:18.039 align:start position:0%
a simple just it started with just other
 
00:27:20.630 --> 00:27:20.640 align:start position:0%
factors to include and so it's just one
 
00:27:22.269 --> 00:27:22.279 align:start position:0%
of those things to just throw out the
 
00:27:24.389 --> 00:27:24.399 align:start position:0%
reminder that there is more than just
 
00:27:26.669 --> 00:27:26.679 align:start position:0%
looking at what's on the surface we need
 
00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:28.840 align:start position:0%
to look at what's underneath the surface
 
00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:30.760 align:start position:0%
as well that was the intent when I wrote
 
00:27:32.909 --> 00:27:32.919 align:start position:0%
it if it would need to be amended I
 
00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
would be more than uh happy to work with
 
00:27:37.549 --> 00:27:37.559 align:start position:0%

00:27:39.149 --> 00:27:39.159 align:start position:0%

as a um resident and parent um I'm here
 
00:28:42.789 --> 00:28:42.799 align:start position:0%
today to speak in opposition of Bill
 
00:28:45.750 --> 00:28:45.760 align:start position:0%
285 so at a young age I was diagnosed
 
00:28:48.190 --> 00:28:48.200 align:start position:0%
with obsessive compulsive disorder by
 
00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
the time I turned age 13 this disorder
 
00:28:53.590 --> 00:28:53.600 align:start position:0%
significantly impacted my ability to
 
00:28:55.750 --> 00:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
function in my daily living skills
 
00:28:57.630 --> 00:28:57.640 align:start position:0%
getting out of bed every morning was
 
00:29:00.310 --> 00:29:00.320 align:start position:0%
extreme daunting um I knew that I would
 
00:29:02.990 --> 00:29:03.000 align:start position:0%
be living in fear all day um constantly
 
00:29:05.029 --> 00:29:05.039 align:start position:0%
completing rituals to try to minimize
 
00:29:08.190 --> 00:29:08.200 align:start position:0%
that fear um I couldn't see that it
 
00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
could get any better and at the age of
 
00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:12.720 align:start position:0%
13 I came home from school and I tried
 
00:29:15.549 --> 00:29:15.559 align:start position:0%
to take my own life for the next four
 
00:29:17.549 --> 00:29:17.559 align:start position:0%
years of my adolescence I had six
 
00:29:19.669 --> 00:29:19.679 align:start position:0%
hospitalizations and a residential
 
00:29:22.549 --> 00:29:22.559 align:start position:0%
placement in addition to OCD I also live
 
00:29:24.630 --> 00:29:24.640 align:start position:0%
with attention deficit disorder and
 
00:29:26.269 --> 00:29:26.279 align:start position:0%
post-traumatic stress
 
00:29:29.350 --> 00:29:29.360 align:start position:0%
disorder I was extreme fortunate that I
 
00:29:31.750 --> 00:29:31.760 align:start position:0%
had supportive parents that stopped at
 
00:29:34.430 --> 00:29:34.440 align:start position:0%
no end to help me get the resources that
 
00:29:37.750 --> 00:29:37.760 align:start position:0%
I needed to have a successful
 
00:29:41.310 --> 00:29:41.320 align:start position:0%
recovery I share this with you today um
 
00:29:43.990 --> 00:29:44.000 align:start position:0%
because I'm a senior HR business partner
 
00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:46.320 align:start position:0%
at a local nonprofit and I've held this
 
00:29:49.470 --> 00:29:49.480 align:start position:0%
position for 19 years um I serve on two
 
00:29:52.190 --> 00:29:52.200 align:start position:0%
boards in the community and the role
 
00:29:54.350 --> 00:29:54.360 align:start position:0%
that I am most proud of is that I am a
 
00:29:58.029 --> 00:29:58.039 align:start position:0%
mom to a three-year-old boy I improved
 
00:30:01.070 --> 00:30:01.080 align:start position:0%
Pro that recovery is possible and that
 
00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:03.120 align:start position:0%
my history of mental illness has no
 
00:30:06.590 --> 00:30:06.600 align:start position:0%
bearing on my ability to parent um if
 
00:30:09.509 --> 00:30:09.519 align:start position:0%
anything because of my experiences I
 
00:30:13.230 --> 00:30:13.240 align:start position:0%
more patient empathetic resilient in my
 
00:30:15.310 --> 00:30:15.320 align:start position:0%
parenting and I hope that I pass all of
 
00:30:17.990 --> 00:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
those traits on to my son I know what I
 
00:30:20.990 --> 00:30:21.000 align:start position:0%
need to do to keep myself well um and I
 
00:30:23.470 --> 00:30:23.480 align:start position:0%
am actively focused on
 
00:30:26.830 --> 00:30:26.840 align:start position:0%
that my concerns are that this bill will
 
00:30:28.909 --> 00:30:28.919 align:start position:0%
allow for further discrimination and
 
00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
damaging stigma I could only imagine how
 
00:30:35.789 --> 00:30:35.799 align:start position:0%
difficult and emotional a parental
 
00:30:38.710 --> 00:30:38.720 align:start position:0%
rights um custody hearing could be for
 
00:30:41.710 --> 00:30:41.720 align:start position:0%
somebody um and my concern is that if
 
00:30:43.549 --> 00:30:43.559 align:start position:0%
this bill should pass it would deter
 
00:30:45.990 --> 00:30:46.000 align:start position:0%
people from seeking the mental health
 
00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:48.320 align:start position:0%
counseling or support that they need um
 
00:30:50.269 --> 00:30:50.279 align:start position:0%
to keep themselves
 
00:30:53.269 --> 00:30:53.279 align:start position:0%
well I asked that instead you focus on
 
00:30:54.870 --> 00:30:54.880 align:start position:0%
active and current behaviors of the
 
00:30:57.269 --> 00:30:57.279 align:start position:0%
parents not a health history because we
 
00:30:58.509 --> 00:30:58.519 align:start position:0%
are not our Di
 
00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:01.120 align:start position:0%
nosis for these reasons I respectfully
 
00:31:03.629 --> 00:31:03.639 align:start position:0%
ask the committee to vote opposed to
 
00:31:08.190 --> 00:31:08.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:10.750 --> 00:31:10.760 align:start position:0%
much thank you for your testimony would
 
00:31:12.350 --> 00:31:12.360 align:start position:0%
you believe it
 
00:31:15.269 --> 00:31:15.279 align:start position:0%
is this kind of testimony that prompted
 
00:31:17.909 --> 00:31:17.919 align:start position:0%
me to file the amendment so that if the
 
00:31:20.430 --> 00:31:20.440 align:start position:0%
amendment passes the bill would read not
 
00:31:22.430 --> 00:31:22.440 align:start position:0%
only mental health but physical health
 
00:31:25.149 --> 00:31:25.159 align:start position:0%
as well so that the spotlight isn't on
 
00:31:28.430 --> 00:31:28.440 align:start position:0%
one thing and that could avert verely
 
00:31:31.430 --> 00:31:31.440 align:start position:0%
affect a person's ability to parent it
 
00:31:35.430 --> 00:31:35.440 align:start position:0%
sounds like you're a Victor MH and it
 
00:31:38.950 --> 00:31:38.960 align:start position:0%
your history does if anything informs
 
00:31:41.549 --> 00:31:41.559 align:start position:0%
your parenting right but it not does not
 
00:31:44.830 --> 00:31:44.840 align:start position:0%
hurt it correct so with the additional
 
00:31:48.389 --> 00:31:48.399 align:start position:0%
language of the amendment um uh would
 
00:31:50.350 --> 00:31:50.360 align:start position:0%
you believe that would take away some if
 
00:31:53.389 --> 00:31:53.399 align:start position:0%
not all of the uh
 
00:31:56.830 --> 00:31:56.840 align:start position:0%
stigma no because I I think
 
00:31:59.870 --> 00:31:59.880 align:start position:0%
that health history how long ago could
 
00:32:01.870 --> 00:32:01.880 align:start position:0%
this be right and and I think that any
 
00:32:04.190 --> 00:32:04.200 align:start position:0%
of that has could have no impact on your
 
00:32:06.350 --> 00:32:06.360 align:start position:0%
ability to par and I think when we take
 
00:32:08.190 --> 00:32:08.200 align:start position:0%
into consideration health and mental
 
00:32:10.549 --> 00:32:10.559 align:start position:0%
health I think we need to focus more on
 
00:32:12.310 --> 00:32:12.320 align:start position:0%
what are the current inactive behaviors
 
00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
of that um not what has happened in the
 
00:32:17.669 --> 00:32:17.679 align:start position:0%
past or what is on a label would you
 
00:32:20.110 --> 00:32:20.120 align:start position:0%
consider that a condition
 
00:32:23.669 --> 00:32:23.679 align:start position:0%
today I'm sorry would you consider the
 
00:32:28.190 --> 00:32:28.200 align:start position:0%
past um difficulty you mentioned
 
00:32:30.149 --> 00:32:30.159 align:start position:0%
condition now that yes it's an active
 
00:32:34.110 --> 00:32:34.120 align:start position:0%
diagnosis that I'm um very upfront about
 
00:32:36.470 --> 00:32:36.480 align:start position:0%
um and you know making sure that I'm
 
00:32:38.629 --> 00:32:38.639 align:start position:0%
keeping myself well I'm always in active
 
00:32:39.990 --> 00:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
treatment because I think that's what
 
00:32:42.190 --> 00:32:42.200 align:start position:0%
you need to do um to continue to keep
 
00:32:44.950 --> 00:32:44.960 align:start position:0%
yourself well um so the fact that if I
 
00:32:47.430 --> 00:32:47.440 align:start position:0%
were to ever be in this situation for
 
00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
them to take into consideration that I
 
00:32:51.549 --> 00:32:51.559 align:start position:0%
was actively seeking supports that
 
00:32:53.350 --> 00:32:53.360 align:start position:0%
continue to keep myself well in my
 
00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
recovery um and that could be held
 
00:32:58.669 --> 00:32:58.679 align:start position:0%
against me um that's concerning
 
00:33:00.750 --> 00:33:00.760 align:start position:0%
any further
 
00:33:03.029 --> 00:33:03.039 align:start position:0%

00:33:31.629 --> 00:33:31.639 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I am I'm speaking today to
 
00:33:34.629 --> 00:33:34.639 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill uh while I appreciate
 
00:33:38.350 --> 00:33:38.360 align:start position:0%
the um concern we have for our children
 
00:33:41.269 --> 00:33:41.279 align:start position:0%
in reading the current language of the
 
00:33:44.750 --> 00:33:44.760 align:start position:0%
law I believe that it fully represents
 
00:33:48.590 --> 00:33:48.600 align:start position:0%
the um care of the children it considers
 
00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
factors of the school system that your
 
00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:53.200 align:start position:0%
children child is in and if they have to
 
00:33:55.789 --> 00:33:55.799 align:start position:0%
move to uh school systems the care the
 
00:33:58.149 --> 00:33:58.159 align:start position:0%
child has the ability to receive from
 
00:34:01.830 --> 00:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
each parent the um it considers abuse uh
 
00:34:04.070 --> 00:34:04.080 align:start position:0%
potential abuse for to the towards the
 
00:34:06.669 --> 00:34:06.679 align:start position:0%
child or towards the parents uh these
 
00:34:08.430 --> 00:34:08.440 align:start position:0%
are things that we are concerned about
 
00:34:11.149 --> 00:34:11.159 align:start position:0%
adding mental health to this list just
 
00:34:13.349 --> 00:34:13.359 align:start position:0%
stigmatizes mental health and presumes
 
00:34:14.790 --> 00:34:14.800 align:start position:0%
somebody having a mental health
 
00:34:18.470 --> 00:34:18.480 align:start position:0%
condition makes them lesser of a parent
 
00:34:19.669 --> 00:34:19.679 align:start position:0%
it means that there's things that they
 
00:34:21.470 --> 00:34:21.480 align:start position:0%
cannot provide as a parent because of
 
00:34:23.310 --> 00:34:23.320 align:start position:0%
their own mental health
 
00:34:25.629 --> 00:34:25.639 align:start position:0%
struggles I had uh looked this up last
 
00:34:27.869 --> 00:34:27.879 align:start position:0%
night and a report from the state in
 
00:34:31.190 --> 00:34:31.200 align:start position:0%
2023 said that a quarter of uh people
 
00:34:32.589 --> 00:34:32.599 align:start position:0%
living in New Hampshire have a mental
 
00:34:35.909 --> 00:34:35.919 align:start position:0%
health illness I believe that is to be
 
00:34:38.109 --> 00:34:38.119 align:start position:0%
larger portion of the population because
 
00:34:39.629 --> 00:34:39.639 align:start position:0%
a lot of people do not come for
 
00:34:42.270 --> 00:34:42.280 align:start position:0%
treatment and by not going to treatment
 
00:34:43.950 --> 00:34:43.960 align:start position:0%
you are not going to receive a diagnosis
 
00:34:45.270 --> 00:34:45.280 align:start position:0%
you're not going to be considered having
 
00:34:48.430 --> 00:34:48.440 align:start position:0%
a mental health illness um even though
 
00:34:50.109 --> 00:34:50.119 align:start position:0%
if you went to treatment you maybe would
 
00:34:53.190 --> 00:34:53.200 align:start position:0%
then be considered that gives reason
 
00:34:54.750 --> 00:34:54.760 align:start position:0%
this bill would give reason for people
 
00:34:57.270 --> 00:34:57.280 align:start position:0%
to not seek treatment out of fear of how
 
00:34:59.710 --> 00:34:59.720 align:start position:0%
it could be used against them if they
 
00:35:01.230 --> 00:35:01.240 align:start position:0%
had a mental health illness I'm
 
00:35:03.670 --> 00:35:03.680 align:start position:0%
concerned with that impact as a mental
 
00:35:04.950 --> 00:35:04.960 align:start position:0%
health counselor I can tell you I
 
00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:07.280 align:start position:0%
frequently write letters to the court
 
00:35:09.870 --> 00:35:09.880 align:start position:0%
for people letting them know that this
 
00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:14.640 align:start position:0%
person is in treatment um and so I am
 
00:35:16.910 --> 00:35:16.920 align:start position:0%
frequently Asked these questions and
 
00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:18.560 align:start position:0%
like asked to represent this and this is
 
00:35:21.310 --> 00:35:21.320 align:start position:0%
frequently coming up in court for people
 
00:35:22.750 --> 00:35:22.760 align:start position:0%
when it is a
 
00:35:25.710 --> 00:35:25.720 align:start position:0%
consideration as the law has it now if
 
00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
it is something to be considered the
 
00:35:29.950 --> 00:35:29.960 align:start position:0%
judge is able to ask for it I recognize
 
00:35:31.470 --> 00:35:31.480 align:start position:0%
that maybe the judges are not always
 
00:35:33.270 --> 00:35:33.280 align:start position:0%
asking for that but then we should
 
00:35:36.150 --> 00:35:36.160 align:start position:0%
really be considering is it how much of
 
00:35:37.910 --> 00:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
a consideration is that or is it more
 
00:35:40.550 --> 00:35:40.560 align:start position:0%
the behaviors that are being discussed
 
00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
already in court that are the
 
00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:45.040 align:start position:0%
consideration not the mental health um I
 
00:35:47.030 --> 00:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for your
 
00:35:49.829 --> 00:35:49.839 align:start position:0%
time would those with a medical
 
00:35:52.790 --> 00:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
condition similarly not seek treatments
 
00:35:55.430 --> 00:35:55.440 align:start position:0%
lest this become discovered and
 
00:35:57.069 --> 00:35:57.079 align:start position:0%
therefore not seek treatment because of
 
00:35:57.079 --> 00:35:59.630 align:start position:0%
therefore not seek treatment because of
that

00:35:59.630 --> 00:35:59.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:36:01.750 --> 00:36:01.760 align:start position:0%
I cannot really speak to that as I only
 
00:36:03.710 --> 00:36:03.720 align:start position:0%
see people for mental health and not for
 
00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:04.990 align:start position:0%
see people for mental health and not for
medical

00:36:04.990 --> 00:36:05.000 align:start position:0%
medical
 
00:36:08.230 --> 00:36:08.240 align:start position:0%
conditions for a good answer any other
 
00:36:10.630 --> 00:36:10.640 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
00:36:13.349 --> 00:36:13.359 align:start position:0%
love thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:36:15.270 --> 00:36:15.280 align:start position:0%
taking my question wouldn't Hippa Hippa
 
00:36:18.190 --> 00:36:18.200 align:start position:0%
covers a lot of this uh you know uh if
 
00:36:20.069 --> 00:36:20.079 align:start position:0%
someone comes from mental health help uh
 
00:36:23.270 --> 00:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
that Hippa does certainly you know keep
 
00:36:26.430 --> 00:36:26.440 align:start position:0%
it private yes so it Hippa is in place
 
00:36:29.870 --> 00:36:29.880 align:start position:0%
it does it keep private see a judge can
 
00:36:32.390 --> 00:36:32.400 align:start position:0%
change that they can subpoena records
 
00:36:35.109 --> 00:36:35.119 align:start position:0%
they can uh subpoena and they have the
 
00:36:37.550 --> 00:36:37.560 align:start position:0%
clinician come and speak if they choose
 
00:36:41.990 --> 00:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
so uh that provides a lot of stress and
 
00:36:43.750 --> 00:36:43.760 align:start position:0%
planning on us as clinicians as we need
 
00:36:46.150 --> 00:36:46.160 align:start position:0%
to get lawyers involved and not all
 
00:36:51.030 --> 00:36:51.040 align:start position:0%
clinicians have will be doing that um to
 
00:36:53.069 --> 00:36:53.079 align:start position:0%
the best of their abilities some
 
00:36:54.910 --> 00:36:54.920 align:start position:0%
clinicians will still have questions
 
00:36:59.550 --> 00:36:59.560 align:start position:0%
they may there's a lot of legal um
 
00:37:01.510 --> 00:37:01.520 align:start position:0%
concerns that we have and how much do we
 
00:37:03.309 --> 00:37:03.319 align:start position:0%
share how much do we not what can we
 
00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:07.200 align:start position:0%
redact um or block out for the records
 
00:37:12.309 --> 00:37:12.319 align:start position:0%
being um brought to court and um there
 
00:37:15.430 --> 00:37:15.440 align:start position:0%
can be some like intimidation towards us
 
00:37:17.990 --> 00:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
of we Rec courts really want everything
 
00:37:19.790 --> 00:37:19.800 align:start position:0%
we want to try to limit that and
 
00:37:21.630 --> 00:37:21.640 align:start position:0%
confusion questions come up from that
 
00:37:25.230 --> 00:37:25.240 align:start position:0%
it's not cut and dry again if the judge
 
00:37:27.390 --> 00:37:27.400 align:start position:0%
asks for this they currently can ask for
 
00:37:28.710 --> 00:37:28.720 align:start position:0%
this this this would just make it that
 
00:37:30.910 --> 00:37:30.920 align:start position:0%
the judge is more likely to be asking
 
00:37:33.430 --> 00:37:33.440 align:start position:0%
for more information and presuming
 
00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:36.560 align:start position:0%
mental health is a negative thing that
 
00:37:43.030 --> 00:37:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:46.750 --> 00:37:46.760 align:start position:0%
parenting representative George
 
00:37:51.230 --> 00:37:51.240 align:start position:0%
thank um thank you for coming to
 
00:37:53.550 --> 00:37:53.560 align:start position:0%
testify I just want to know do you know
 
00:37:56.710 --> 00:37:56.720 align:start position:0%
there is a the people from mental health
 
00:37:59.430 --> 00:37:59.440 align:start position:0%
who are Den iable you know that there is
 
00:38:03.069 --> 00:38:03.079 align:start position:0%
a some they know they have a problem but
 
00:38:05.470 --> 00:38:05.480 align:start position:0%
they don't
 
00:38:09.150 --> 00:38:09.160 align:start position:0%
accept yes there's um many reasons for
 
00:38:13.069 --> 00:38:13.079 align:start position:0%
people sometimes it is due to U concerns
 
00:38:14.910 --> 00:38:14.920 align:start position:0%
that may come up that they do accept it
 
00:38:16.190 --> 00:38:16.200 align:start position:0%
sometimes there's what's called
 
00:38:18.950 --> 00:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
anosognosia which is a um symptom of
 
00:38:20.950 --> 00:38:20.960 align:start position:0%
some mental health illnesses where a
 
00:38:22.670 --> 00:38:22.680 align:start position:0%
person does not have the ability to
 
00:38:26.270 --> 00:38:26.280 align:start position:0%
recognize their symptoms um even when
 
00:38:28.910 --> 00:38:28.920 align:start position:0%
they are explained to the person they
 
00:38:30.430 --> 00:38:30.440 align:start position:0%
their brain is not able to process it
 
00:38:32.349 --> 00:38:32.359 align:start position:0%
they don't recognize
 
00:38:37.190 --> 00:38:37.200 align:start position:0%
it follow thank you Mr chairman um when
 
00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:41.040 align:start position:0%
I talk about deniable because there is a
 
00:38:44.150 --> 00:38:44.160 align:start position:0%
I know some I know a couple who was
 
00:38:47.309 --> 00:38:47.319 align:start position:0%
already like a the man is a with a
 
00:38:51.510 --> 00:38:51.520 align:start position:0%
mental health already everything but in
 
00:38:55.670 --> 00:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
the quote he said the wife who are
 
00:38:58.430 --> 00:38:58.440 align:start position:0%
mental health and the Cote
 
00:39:02.750 --> 00:39:02.760 align:start position:0%
believe the the guy the man and the wife
 
00:39:06.109 --> 00:39:06.119 align:start position:0%
who's not never be in a question please
 
00:39:07.670 --> 00:39:07.680 align:start position:0%
that's what I want to say for the
 
00:39:10.710 --> 00:39:10.720 align:start position:0%
deniable do you do you believe like
 
00:39:13.630 --> 00:39:13.640 align:start position:0%
those people can just make somebody else
 
00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:15.470 align:start position:0%
those people can just make somebody else
a

00:39:15.470 --> 00:39:15.480 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:39:18.750 --> 00:39:18.760 align:start position:0%
problem uh so my concern is that that
 
00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
they would be making somebody else a
 
00:39:21.470 --> 00:39:21.480 align:start position:0%
problem and then now this person's
 
00:39:25.030 --> 00:39:25.040 align:start position:0%
mental health is being considered um
 
00:39:26.870 --> 00:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
when we're bringing mental health in it
 
00:39:29.390 --> 00:39:29.400 align:start position:0%
can be a big Blame Game there can be a
 
00:39:31.790 --> 00:39:31.800 align:start position:0%
lot of pointing fingers um we should not
 
00:39:33.950 --> 00:39:33.960 align:start position:0%
be looking at a person's mental health
 
00:39:36.150 --> 00:39:36.160 align:start position:0%
but their parenting their actions
 
00:39:38.550 --> 00:39:38.560 align:start position:0%
behaviors things that have happened uh
 
00:39:40.870 --> 00:39:40.880 align:start position:0%
which I believe the law as is currently
 
00:39:44.630 --> 00:39:44.640 align:start position:0%
written does do thank
 
00:39:48.349 --> 00:39:48.359 align:start position:0%

285 um as you um have read House Bill uh
 
00:40:28.829 --> 00:40:28.839 align:start position:0%
285 allows the court to consider quote
 
00:40:30.550 --> 00:40:30.560 align:start position:0%
any known mental health conditions of
 
00:40:32.230 --> 00:40:32.240 align:start position:0%
the parent and that is how it's written
 
00:40:33.950 --> 00:40:33.960 align:start position:0%
it's not the the amendment I understand
 
00:40:36.510 --> 00:40:36.520 align:start position:0%
there is an amendment um as a factor
 
00:40:38.390 --> 00:40:38.400 align:start position:0%
relevant uh to the determination or
 
00:40:39.990 --> 00:40:40.000 align:start position:0%
parental rights and responsibilities
 
00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:42.720 align:start position:0%
regardless of that condition's impact on
 
00:40:45.870 --> 00:40:45.880 align:start position:0%
the person's ability to parent this only
 
00:40:48.349 --> 00:40:48.359 align:start position:0%
furthers damaging stigma and jeopardizes
 
00:40:50.589 --> 00:40:50.599 align:start position:0%
the rights of individuals living with
 
00:40:52.870 --> 00:40:52.880 align:start position:0%

00:40:55.950 --> 00:40:55.960 align:start position:0%
mental illness like Simply Having a
 
00:40:58.589 --> 00:40:58.599 align:start position:0%
other health condition in and of itself
 
00:41:00.750 --> 00:41:00.760 align:start position:0%
does not inherently impact a person's
 
00:41:02.430 --> 00:41:02.440 align:start position:0%
ability to parent their
 
00:41:05.349 --> 00:41:05.359 align:start position:0%
child while one symptoms relating to
 
00:41:07.270 --> 00:41:07.280 align:start position:0%
their condition May progress to a point
 
00:41:10.030 --> 00:41:10.040 align:start position:0%
that impacts the parenting ability that
 
00:41:12.309 --> 00:41:12.319 align:start position:0%
is not unique to mental
 
00:41:14.630 --> 00:41:14.640 align:start position:0%
illness if a parent has untreated
 
00:41:18.390 --> 00:41:18.400 align:start position:0%
epilepsy or diabetes they could have um
 
00:41:20.150 --> 00:41:20.160 align:start position:0%
a period where they go unconscious and
 
00:41:22.510 --> 00:41:22.520 align:start position:0%
are unable to care for their child um
 
00:41:24.190 --> 00:41:24.200 align:start position:0%
there could be other medical conditions
 
00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:26.160 align:start position:0%
as well that impair their ability to
 
00:41:27.829 --> 00:41:27.839 align:start position:0%
parent if left
 
00:41:30.030 --> 00:41:30.040 align:start position:0%
treated however this bill makes no
 
00:41:31.870 --> 00:41:31.880 align:start position:0%
consideration for any health conditions
 
00:41:34.390 --> 00:41:34.400 align:start position:0%
other than mental health conditions from
 
00:41:36.190 --> 00:41:36.200 align:start position:0%
Nom New Hampshire's perspective
 
00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:38.160 align:start position:0%
targeting a specific population of
 
00:41:40.230 --> 00:41:40.240 align:start position:0%
individuals with mental illness without
 
00:41:42.470 --> 00:41:42.480 align:start position:0%
any consideration of the conditions
 
00:41:45.270 --> 00:41:45.280 align:start position:0%
impact on the parenting ability rather
 
00:41:46.950 --> 00:41:46.960 align:start position:0%
than considering all health conditions
 
00:41:49.349 --> 00:41:49.359 align:start position:0%
makes this policy
 
00:41:51.069 --> 00:41:51.079 align:start position:0%
discriminatory with treatment and
 
00:41:52.950 --> 00:41:52.960 align:start position:0%
support people are able to live full
 
00:41:55.470 --> 00:41:55.480 align:start position:0%
successful lives as you heard um Sarah
 
00:41:58.150 --> 00:41:58.160 align:start position:0%
horn talk about um
 
00:41:59.829 --> 00:41:59.839 align:start position:0%
just the same someone with a chronic
 
00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:01.200 align:start position:0%
health condition can live a full and
 
00:42:03.950 --> 00:42:03.960 align:start position:0%
healthy life simply put no one should be
 
00:42:06.430 --> 00:42:06.440 align:start position:0%
singled out because of their
 
00:42:09.550 --> 00:42:09.560 align:start position:0%
diagnosis Beyond being discriminatory um
 
00:42:11.990 --> 00:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
such this policy is also unnecessary you
 
00:42:14.390 --> 00:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
heard um the the previous speaker talk
 
00:42:16.870 --> 00:42:16.880 align:start position:0%
about the fact that all of these uh
 
00:42:18.870 --> 00:42:18.880 align:start position:0%
factors can be considered already under
 
00:42:21.150 --> 00:42:21.160 align:start position:0%
the law it's not necessary to call out
 
00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
mental mental illness in and of itself
 
00:42:26.750 --> 00:42:26.760 align:start position:0%
it is really looking at the parents
 
00:42:29.030 --> 00:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
Behavior behaviors in their ability to
 
00:42:30.470 --> 00:42:30.480 align:start position:0%
parent the
 
00:42:34.190 --> 00:42:34.200 align:start position:0%
child um additionally um if there are
 
00:42:36.470 --> 00:42:36.480 align:start position:0%
immediate concerns about a parent
 
00:42:39.870 --> 00:42:39.880 align:start position:0%
ability to parent then you can call DCF
 
00:42:41.670 --> 00:42:41.680 align:start position:0%
that's what they're there for if a
 
00:42:43.950 --> 00:42:43.960 align:start position:0%
parents a symptoms start interfering
 
00:42:45.549 --> 00:42:45.559 align:start position:0%
with their ability to parent their child
 
00:42:47.910 --> 00:42:47.920 align:start position:0%
you can pick up the phone and call dcyf
 
00:42:51.630 --> 00:42:51.640 align:start position:0%
and parenting plans take a long time to
 
00:42:55.270 --> 00:42:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:00.109 --> 00:43:00.119 align:start position:0%
so using the parent plan as a way to um
 
00:43:03.309 --> 00:43:03.319 align:start position:0%
save a child from a parent's potential
 
00:43:04.910 --> 00:43:04.920 align:start position:0%
um mental health conditions affecting
 
00:43:06.630 --> 00:43:06.640 align:start position:0%
their ability to parent is not the best
 
00:43:09.510 --> 00:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
way to go about this um I did include
 
00:43:11.990 --> 00:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
some language that Nami New Hampshire
 
00:43:15.670 --> 00:43:15.680 align:start position:0%
was okay with if the Committees um would
 
00:43:19.190 --> 00:43:19.200 align:start position:0%
like to pass a bill which
 
00:43:22.150 --> 00:43:22.160 align:start position:0%
says including due consideration for any
 
00:43:24.309 --> 00:43:24.319 align:start position:0%
known health conditions that impact the
 
00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:26.640 align:start position:0%
best interest of the child I know that
 
00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:28.069 align:start position:0%
best interest of the child I know that
the

00:43:28.069 --> 00:43:28.079 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:43:31.510 --> 00:43:31.520 align:start position:0%
um Amendment says health conditions
 
00:43:33.589 --> 00:43:33.599 align:start position:0%
including mental health that is
 
00:43:35.390 --> 00:43:35.400 align:start position:0%
something we would still oppose because
 
00:43:37.710 --> 00:43:37.720 align:start position:0%
it specifically calls out mental health
 
00:43:39.270 --> 00:43:39.280 align:start position:0%
and shines a light on Mental Health
 
00:43:40.910 --> 00:43:40.920 align:start position:0%
which we do believe is still
 
00:43:42.910 --> 00:43:42.920 align:start position:0%
discriminatory um so for those reasons
 
00:43:45.270 --> 00:43:45.280 align:start position:0%
we are opposing this bill today and we
 
00:43:47.589 --> 00:43:47.599 align:start position:0%
would oppose the amendment as I heard
 
00:43:52.630 --> 00:43:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:54.990 --> 00:43:55.000 align:start position:0%
spoke are you familiar with the fact
 
00:43:57.270 --> 00:43:57.280 align:start position:0%
that in other contexts
 
00:44:01.430 --> 00:44:01.440 align:start position:0%
mental health is asked to be referenced
 
00:44:04.630 --> 00:44:04.640 align:start position:0%
because the assertion is otherwise it is
 
00:44:07.829 --> 00:44:07.839 align:start position:0%
forgotten and mental and health
 
00:44:11.309 --> 00:44:11.319 align:start position:0%
conditions is assumed to be physical so
 
00:44:13.270 --> 00:44:13.280 align:start position:0%
would you believe that I mean is that in
 
00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:14.230 align:start position:0%
would you believe that I mean is that in
your

00:44:14.230 --> 00:44:14.240 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:44:16.430 --> 00:44:16.440 align:start position:0%
experience I think that one of the
 
00:44:17.750 --> 00:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
things that we're trying to do is
 
00:44:19.510 --> 00:44:19.520 align:start position:0%
educate people so that isn't the
 
00:44:22.230 --> 00:44:22.240 align:start position:0%
experience I mean health conditions cons
 
00:44:24.470 --> 00:44:24.480 align:start position:0%
contain mental health conditions and it
 
00:44:26.309 --> 00:44:26.319 align:start position:0%
should be that way and maybe we need to
 
00:44:28.510 --> 00:44:28.520 align:start position:0%
educate our judge Jes not change our
 
00:44:30.230 --> 00:44:30.240 align:start position:0%
laws because if it's an issue with the
 
00:44:32.230 --> 00:44:32.240 align:start position:0%
judges not asking the questions then
 
00:44:35.150 --> 00:44:35.160 align:start position:0%
that's an education issue well as you
 
00:44:37.270 --> 00:44:37.280 align:start position:0%
know I've been fighting for continuing
 
00:44:39.670 --> 00:44:39.680 align:start position:0%
education for judges for some time and
 
00:44:41.630 --> 00:44:41.640 align:start position:0%
will continue especially as long as my
 
00:44:43.910 --> 00:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
wife has to do Boku amounts as a
 
00:44:46.710 --> 00:44:46.720 align:start position:0%
physician so I'm with you on that let's
 
00:44:49.030 --> 00:44:49.040 align:start position:0%
do that any questions for uh the
 
00:44:50.829 --> 00:44:50.839 align:start position:0%
counselor representative
 
00:44:53.470 --> 00:44:53.480 align:start position:0%
sh uh in in interest of full
 
00:44:56.589 --> 00:44:56.599 align:start position:0%
transparency uh Miss Steven suffers from
 
00:44:56.599 --> 00:44:57.589 align:start position:0%
transparency uh Miss Steven suffers from
the

00:44:57.589 --> 00:44:57.599 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:44:59.670 --> 00:44:59.680 align:start position:0%
uh Misfortune of having had classes from
 
00:45:02.109 --> 00:45:02.119 align:start position:0%
me while at the law school so I just
 
00:45:03.670 --> 00:45:03.680 align:start position:0%
want to make that clear up front are you
 
00:45:07.710 --> 00:45:07.720 align:start position:0%
recusing yourself or recusing her
 
00:45:11.510 --> 00:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
uh uh no answer to that question um so
 
00:45:14.150 --> 00:45:14.160 align:start position:0%
is it you're welcome there's the Fifth
 
00:45:16.030 --> 00:45:16.040 align:start position:0%
Amendment thing maybe you haven't gotten
 
00:45:20.109 --> 00:45:20.119 align:start position:0%

chair welcome no uh and thank you Miss
 
00:45:27.990 --> 00:45:28.000 align:start position:0%
Stevens um is it nami's position that
 
00:45:32.109 --> 00:45:32.119 align:start position:0%
just the name of a mental illness saying
 
00:45:34.470 --> 00:45:34.480 align:start position:0%
that somebody suffers from ex mental
 
00:45:38.670 --> 00:45:38.680 align:start position:0%
illness tells you nothing about the
 
00:45:40.710 --> 00:45:40.720 align:start position:0%
quality of their parenting or their
 
00:45:45.829 --> 00:45:45.839 align:start position:0%
ability to uh provide uh fit parenting
 
00:45:48.430 --> 00:45:48.440 align:start position:0%
that is correct um even you know even
 
00:45:50.750 --> 00:45:50.760 align:start position:0%
folks who may choose not to get
 
00:45:53.109 --> 00:45:53.119 align:start position:0%
treatment it doesn't mean that that
 
00:45:54.950 --> 00:45:54.960 align:start position:0%
their mental illness has any impact on
 
00:45:56.589 --> 00:45:56.599 align:start position:0%
their ability to parent you really need
 
00:45:59.630 --> 00:45:59.640 align:start position:0%
to look at their behaviors um not their
 
00:46:04.069 --> 00:46:04.079 align:start position:0%
diagnosis and that is our position thank
 
00:46:07.829 --> 00:46:07.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:10.109 --> 00:46:10.119 align:start position:0%
questions represent you are so
 
00:46:12.710 --> 00:46:12.720 align:start position:0%
backlighted it's just sort of wave uh
 
00:46:14.589 --> 00:46:14.599 align:start position:0%
you were the new uh representative
 
00:46:17.950 --> 00:46:17.960 align:start position:0%

LC thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:46:23.950 --> 00:46:23.960 align:start position:0%
taking my question do you um believe
 
00:46:26.270 --> 00:46:26.280 align:start position:0%
that as a society today that there's
 
00:46:29.470 --> 00:46:29.480 align:start position:0%
like this stigma around mental illness
 
00:46:33.349 --> 00:46:33.359 align:start position:0%
that we have that it's seen as kind of a
 
00:46:36.150 --> 00:46:36.160 align:start position:0%
definitive like that defines you versus
 
00:46:37.950 --> 00:46:37.960 align:start position:0%
it's a part of you and it's not what
 
00:46:37.960 --> 00:46:39.309 align:start position:0%
it's a part of you and it's not what
defines

00:46:39.309 --> 00:46:39.319 align:start position:0%
defines
 
00:46:41.870 --> 00:46:41.880 align:start position:0%
you uh yes thank you for the question
 
00:46:43.390 --> 00:46:43.400 align:start position:0%
yes we do believe that I mean one of the
 
00:46:45.030 --> 00:46:45.040 align:start position:0%
things that Nami New Hampshire strives
 
00:46:49.470 --> 00:46:49.480 align:start position:0%
for is to rid our society of stigma and
 
00:46:50.870 --> 00:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
discrimination against people with
 
00:46:53.109 --> 00:46:53.119 align:start position:0%
mental illness and one way that we do
 
00:46:55.390 --> 00:46:55.400 align:start position:0%
that is by fighting against bills such
 
00:47:00.030 --> 00:47:00.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:02.950 --> 00:47:02.960 align:start position:0%

morning chairman Pearson members of the
 
00:47:21.870 --> 00:47:21.880 align:start position:0%
committee I'm Karen Rosenberg I'm the
 
00:47:23.549 --> 00:47:23.559 align:start position:0%
policy director at the disability rights
 
00:47:25.030 --> 00:47:25.040 align:start position:0%
Center which is New Hampshire's
 
00:47:26.870 --> 00:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
protection and advocacy system for
 
00:47:28.950 --> 00:47:28.960 align:start position:0%
people with disabilities I'm here to
 
00:47:31.150 --> 00:47:31.160 align:start position:0%
testify in opposition to this bill for
 
00:47:33.190 --> 00:47:33.200 align:start position:0%
the reasons that you've heard from I
 
00:47:36.630 --> 00:47:36.640 align:start position:0%
think uniformally from everyone um with
 
00:47:38.030 --> 00:47:38.040 align:start position:0%
the exception of the bill sponsor of
 
00:47:41.910 --> 00:47:41.920 align:start position:0%
course um we um see this as very
 
00:47:44.150 --> 00:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
discriminatory um and furthering the
 
00:47:46.589 --> 00:47:46.599 align:start position:0%
stigma of mental illness as you've heard
 
00:47:47.829 --> 00:47:47.839 align:start position:0%
just because someone may have
 
00:47:49.510 --> 00:47:49.520 align:start position:0%
experienced a mental illness either
 
00:47:51.349 --> 00:47:51.359 align:start position:0%
currently or at some point in their
 
00:47:54.549 --> 00:47:54.559 align:start position:0%
history doesn't mean that they are not
 
00:47:56.510 --> 00:47:56.520 align:start position:0%
good parents or that they cannot be
 
00:47:59.589 --> 00:47:59.599 align:start position:0%
effective Ive good parents and
 
00:48:03.670 --> 00:48:03.680 align:start position:0%
so enacting a law that would single this
 
00:48:05.349 --> 00:48:05.359 align:start position:0%
not even a particular condition but just
 
00:48:06.829 --> 00:48:06.839 align:start position:0%
the fact that someone has experienced
 
00:48:08.390 --> 00:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
some mental health condition at some
 
00:48:10.950 --> 00:48:10.960 align:start position:0%
time we see as perpetuating
 
00:48:13.910 --> 00:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
discrimination P perpetuating a stigma
 
00:48:17.790 --> 00:48:17.800 align:start position:0%
and really not necessary our current law
 
00:48:20.589 --> 00:48:20.599 align:start position:0%
is provides a list of factors that
 
00:48:22.589 --> 00:48:22.599 align:start position:0%
courts must consider when they're
 
00:48:26.270 --> 00:48:26.280 align:start position:0%
determining whether um a enabling a
 
00:48:27.870 --> 00:48:27.880 align:start position:0%
parent to spend whatever amount of time
 
00:48:29.150 --> 00:48:29.160 align:start position:0%
they decide they're going to spend with
 
00:48:31.390 --> 00:48:31.400 align:start position:0%
their child is in the best interest of
 
00:48:34.349 --> 00:48:34.359 align:start position:0%
the child or not and besides having this
 
00:48:36.430 --> 00:48:36.440 align:start position:0%
list of factors which is you know quite
 
00:48:39.069 --> 00:48:39.079 align:start position:0%
broad relationships with a child ability
 
00:48:41.230 --> 00:48:41.240 align:start position:0%
of each child to parent the ch um to
 
00:48:43.030 --> 00:48:43.040 align:start position:0%
provide nurturing love affection and
 
00:48:44.150 --> 00:48:44.160 align:start position:0%
guidance I mean you've gone through the
 
00:48:45.950 --> 00:48:45.960 align:start position:0%
list you've heard from other people
 
00:48:49.270 --> 00:48:49.280 align:start position:0%
there's also broad discretion um for the
 
00:48:51.789 --> 00:48:51.799 align:start position:0%
court to consider any other factor and
 
00:48:55.270 --> 00:48:55.280 align:start position:0%
courts do ask unrepresented parties
 
00:48:57.670 --> 00:48:57.680 align:start position:0%
questions I have not practiced in Family
 
00:49:00.549 --> 00:49:00.559 align:start position:0%
Law Courts since a clinic in law school
 
00:49:02.990 --> 00:49:03.000 align:start position:0%
but in my experience practicing law when
 
00:49:04.870 --> 00:49:04.880 align:start position:0%
courts have questions they know how to
 
00:49:07.829 --> 00:49:07.839 align:start position:0%
ask them and if there are concerns that
 
00:49:10.270 --> 00:49:10.280 align:start position:0%
are raised courts can inquire of the
 
00:49:12.190 --> 00:49:12.200 align:start position:0%
parties whether there are concerns about
 
00:49:14.990 --> 00:49:15.000 align:start position:0%
parenting and I think that a parent who
 
00:49:18.549 --> 00:49:18.559 align:start position:0%
is concerned that the co-parent is
 
00:49:20.829 --> 00:49:20.839 align:start position:0%
potentially going to be harmful in their
 
00:49:22.950 --> 00:49:22.960 align:start position:0%
parenting approach to the child they
 
00:49:24.270 --> 00:49:24.280 align:start position:0%
will be able to raise that and the court
 
00:49:26.150 --> 00:49:26.160 align:start position:0%
will be able to ask questions under our
 
00:49:27.230 --> 00:49:27.240 align:start position:0%
current law
 
00:49:29.589 --> 00:49:29.599 align:start position:0%
it's just not necessary um and
 
00:49:33.270 --> 00:49:33.280 align:start position:0%
potentially harmful to single out mental
 
00:49:36.109 --> 00:49:36.119 align:start position:0%
illness or really any physical illness
 
00:49:38.710 --> 00:49:38.720 align:start position:0%
too because people manage both physical
 
00:49:41.670 --> 00:49:41.680 align:start position:0%
illness and mental illness um all the
 
00:49:43.870 --> 00:49:43.880 align:start position:0%
time and it doesn't necessarily impact
 
00:49:46.109 --> 00:49:46.119 align:start position:0%
their parenting
 
00:49:49.430 --> 00:49:49.440 align:start position:0%
abilities any questions for the witness
 
00:49:51.670 --> 00:49:51.680 align:start position:0%
representative love thank you Mr
 
00:49:52.870 --> 00:49:52.880 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:55.349 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
question

00:49:55.349 --> 00:49:55.359 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:49:59.030 --> 00:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
um have having gone through a thing like
 
00:50:01.150 --> 00:50:01.160 align:start position:0%
this and um you know not being able to
 
00:50:03.630 --> 00:50:03.640 align:start position:0%
bring up mental illness uh I've got a a
 
00:50:06.750 --> 00:50:06.760 align:start position:0%
25y old that's still in therapy today
 
00:50:09.309 --> 00:50:09.319 align:start position:0%
it's it's a generational thing when when
 
00:50:11.510 --> 00:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
bad things happen to kids uh they they
 
00:50:14.030 --> 00:50:14.040 align:start position:0%
tend to stay a mess would you have any
 
00:50:17.430 --> 00:50:17.440 align:start position:0%
suggestions for for um and and I do
 
00:50:19.030 --> 00:50:19.040 align:start position:0%
believe in recovery from mental illness
 
00:50:22.710 --> 00:50:22.720 align:start position:0%
by the way okay um do do you have any
 
00:50:24.870 --> 00:50:24.880 align:start position:0%
suggestions that you could uh could give
 
00:50:27.270 --> 00:50:27.280 align:start position:0%
us to to amend this um we've got this
 
00:50:28.950 --> 00:50:28.960 align:start position:0%
one here uh you know just take the
 
00:50:30.829 --> 00:50:30.839 align:start position:0%
mental part out of it and just Heth
 
00:50:33.309 --> 00:50:33.319 align:start position:0%
questions but uh something needs to be
 
00:50:34.670 --> 00:50:34.680 align:start position:0%
done because the courts are ignoring the
 
00:50:38.109 --> 00:50:38.119 align:start position:0%
law I I well that may be if courts are
 
00:50:40.670 --> 00:50:40.680 align:start position:0%
ignoring their obligation to make
 
00:50:43.349 --> 00:50:43.359 align:start position:0%
rulings and ask questions to determine
 
00:50:46.109 --> 00:50:46.119 align:start position:0%
whether a particular outcome is in the
 
00:50:47.990 --> 00:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
best interest of a child that's a whole
 
00:50:51.470 --> 00:50:51.480 align:start position:0%
other problem right our courts really
 
00:50:55.309 --> 00:50:55.319 align:start position:0%
are in place we um nominate judges and
 
00:50:57.829 --> 00:50:57.839 align:start position:0%
go through a process and there are Court
 
00:51:00.349 --> 00:51:00.359 align:start position:0%
their evaluations of Judges after
 
00:51:02.750 --> 00:51:02.760 align:start position:0%
they've been in office I mean that
 
00:51:04.349 --> 00:51:04.359 align:start position:0%
that's a different kind of problem you
 
00:51:07.230 --> 00:51:07.240 align:start position:0%
could pass any number of laws and if a
 
00:51:09.589 --> 00:51:09.599 align:start position:0%
court is not following the law that's a
 
00:51:11.470 --> 00:51:11.480 align:start position:0%
whole other problem I think the current
 
00:51:13.990 --> 00:51:14.000 align:start position:0%
law is not the problem I think the
 
00:51:16.670 --> 00:51:16.680 align:start position:0%
current law gives courts what they need
 
00:51:20.990 --> 00:51:21.000 align:start position:0%
to make inquiries to determine whether a
 
00:51:23.069 --> 00:51:23.079 align:start position:0%
a particular placement decision or
 
00:51:25.309 --> 00:51:25.319 align:start position:0%
parental responsibility decision is in
 
00:51:31.630 --> 00:51:31.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:35.829 --> 00:51:35.839 align:start position:0%
would you second um attorney Stevens
 
00:51:38.750 --> 00:51:38.760 align:start position:0%
statement that perhaps in the we hope
 
00:51:42.309 --> 00:51:42.319 align:start position:0%
ever growing amount of continu excuse me
 
00:51:44.750 --> 00:51:44.760 align:start position:0%
Ed the judges have there'd be a little
 
00:51:45.950 --> 00:51:45.960 align:start position:0%
section on
 
00:51:48.950 --> 00:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
this well you know certainly it would be
 
00:51:51.789 --> 00:51:51.799 align:start position:0%
helpful for courts to be you know have
 
00:51:55.109 --> 00:51:55.119 align:start position:0%
opportunities to be educated around what
 
00:51:57.349 --> 00:51:57.359 align:start position:0%
are the factors that they need to
 
00:52:00.270 --> 00:52:00.280 align:start position:0%
consider um when making these really
 
00:52:01.789 --> 00:52:01.799 align:start position:0%
very important decisions that will
 
00:52:04.910 --> 00:52:04.920 align:start position:0%
impact the life of a child thank you any
 
00:52:08.630 --> 00:52:08.640 align:start position:0%

um I'm just wondering you may not even
 
00:52:17.470 --> 00:52:17.480 align:start position:0%
have the answer I may have to ask dcyf
 
00:52:21.150 --> 00:52:21.160 align:start position:0%
this but how many children are in DCF
 
00:52:23.589 --> 00:52:23.599 align:start position:0%

the adoptive track actually have parents
 
00:52:27.710 --> 00:52:27.720 align:start position:0%
with with mental
 
00:52:30.789 --> 00:52:30.799 align:start position:0%
illness you're correct I I don't have
 
00:52:36.230 --> 00:52:36.240 align:start position:0%

hearing you have been
 
00:53:11.670 --> 00:53:11.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:11.680 --> 00:53:13.630 align:start position:0%
 
card

00:53:13.630 --> 00:53:13.640 align:start position:0%
card
 
00:53:16.390 --> 00:53:16.400 align:start position:0%
okay I have called you to come
 
00:53:30.670 --> 00:53:30.680 align:start position:0%

thank you for allowing me to address you
 
00:53:36.910 --> 00:53:36.920 align:start position:0%
with my my feelings about this
 
00:53:40.829 --> 00:53:40.839 align:start position:0%
bill first of all to me a child's needs
 
00:53:44.390 --> 00:53:44.400 align:start position:0%
Trump a parent's needs hopefully we want
 
00:53:52.789 --> 00:53:52.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:57.789 --> 00:53:57.799 align:start position:0%
vulnerable this bill is to address
 
00:54:02.990 --> 00:54:03.000 align:start position:0%
any known active current mental health
 
00:54:05.309 --> 00:54:05.319 align:start position:0%
conditions of the parent that are
 
00:54:06.870 --> 00:54:06.880 align:start position:0%
affecting their
 
00:54:10.589 --> 00:54:10.599 align:start position:0%
parenting this bill is not interested in
 
00:54:15.109 --> 00:54:15.119 align:start position:0%
a parent's mental health history that is
 
00:54:15.119 --> 00:54:16.789 align:start position:0%
a parent's mental health history that is
not

00:54:16.789 --> 00:54:16.799 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:54:16.799 --> 00:54:18.549 align:start position:0%
not
necessary

00:54:18.549 --> 00:54:18.559 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
00:54:20.910 --> 00:54:20.920 align:start position:0%
accommodation of the
 
00:54:23.990 --> 00:54:24.000 align:start position:0%
illness can be uh can be made to
 
00:54:27.870 --> 00:54:27.880 align:start position:0%
continue parenting as long long as we're
 
00:54:30.750 --> 00:54:30.760 align:start position:0%
concerned that the par well I mean we
 
00:54:34.630 --> 00:54:34.640 align:start position:0%
are concerned that the parenting is
 
00:54:37.750 --> 00:54:37.760 align:start position:0%
healthy and a person with mental illness
 
00:54:39.150 --> 00:54:39.160 align:start position:0%
who's being
 
00:54:41.630 --> 00:54:41.640 align:start position:0%
treated and feels
 
00:54:45.670 --> 00:54:45.680 align:start position:0%
good that that person is not a target of
 
00:54:49.870 --> 00:54:49.880 align:start position:0%
this of the changes that we want to be
 
00:54:53.630 --> 00:54:53.640 align:start position:0%
made the majority of states in the in
 
00:54:57.270 --> 00:54:57.280 align:start position:0%
the US have laws that specify
 
00:55:00.589 --> 00:55:00.599 align:start position:0%
consideration of current mental health
 
00:55:03.950 --> 00:55:03.960 align:start position:0%
not the history of the health currently
 
00:55:08.470 --> 00:55:08.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire law does not allow such
 
00:55:10.990 --> 00:55:11.000 align:start position:0%
consideration and this certainly cannot
 
00:55:14.109 --> 00:55:14.119 align:start position:0%
be initiated by the other
 
00:55:17.430 --> 00:55:17.440 align:start position:0%
parent they are prohibited from bringing
 
00:55:21.430 --> 00:55:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:24.549 --> 00:55:24.559 align:start position:0%
up I would like this bill to be amended
 
00:55:26.549 --> 00:55:26.559 align:start position:0%
to address the concerns that you're
 
00:55:26.559 --> 00:55:28.870 align:start position:0%
to address the concerns that you're
bringing

00:55:28.870 --> 00:55:28.880 align:start position:0%
bringing
 
00:55:32.589 --> 00:55:32.599 align:start position:0%
up but the bottom line is the issue has
 
00:55:35.069 --> 00:55:35.079 align:start position:0%
to be brought up in the consideration
 
00:55:35.079 --> 00:55:38.029 align:start position:0%
to be brought up in the consideration
for

00:55:38.029 --> 00:55:38.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:40.589 --> 00:55:40.599 align:start position:0%
parenting any parenting should be
 
00:55:43.270 --> 00:55:43.280 align:start position:0%
considered that that's considered
 
00:55:47.950 --> 00:55:47.960 align:start position:0%
wanting should be observable by other
 
00:55:50.549 --> 00:55:50.559 align:start position:0%
people if they're really good if a
 
00:55:52.870 --> 00:55:52.880 align:start position:0%
parent if a parent is really vindictive
 
00:55:56.910 --> 00:55:56.920 align:start position:0%
and really unusual they can it from
 
00:55:59.510 --> 00:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
other people but usually other people
 
00:56:02.349 --> 00:56:02.359 align:start position:0%
are aware and are concerned for the
 
00:56:04.910 --> 00:56:04.920 align:start position:0%
child when they observe negative
 
00:56:07.549 --> 00:56:07.559 align:start position:0%
parenting some people are really good at
 
00:56:11.589 --> 00:56:11.599 align:start position:0%
hiding it but I'd say that people in
 
00:56:14.589 --> 00:56:14.599 align:start position:0%
court are generally going to believe
 
00:56:16.710 --> 00:56:16.720 align:start position:0%
other people more so than the other
 
00:56:20.270 --> 00:56:20.280 align:start position:0%
parent so it's really helpful if other
 
00:56:22.470 --> 00:56:22.480 align:start position:0%
people are willing to stand up for that
 
00:56:25.230 --> 00:56:25.240 align:start position:0%
child and testify on what they've
 
00:56:28.549 --> 00:56:28.559 align:start position:0%
observed but they also have to be
 
00:56:32.230 --> 00:56:32.240 align:start position:0%
permitted by the judge because that can
 
00:56:34.910 --> 00:56:34.920 align:start position:0%
be denied under our current rules of
 
00:56:38.470 --> 00:56:38.480 align:start position:0%
Family Court the the presiding
 
00:56:41.109 --> 00:56:41.119 align:start position:0%
magistrate I don't use the term judge
 
00:56:44.470 --> 00:56:44.480 align:start position:0%
easily because that's defin a definition
 
00:56:47.150 --> 00:56:47.160 align:start position:0%
and we don't have that kind of judges in
 
00:56:50.430 --> 00:56:50.440 align:start position:0%
family court so I'll say magistrate the
 
00:56:54.029 --> 00:56:54.039 align:start position:0%
magistrate can choose not to have any
 
00:56:57.470 --> 00:56:57.480 align:start position:0%
testimony not to have any evidence shown
 
00:56:59.710 --> 00:56:59.720 align:start position:0%
so what we're asking for is that this
 
00:57:03.630 --> 00:57:03.640 align:start position:0%
would be a requirement that they look at
 
00:57:07.230 --> 00:57:07.240 align:start position:0%
look at uh other input if there is a
 
00:57:12.470 --> 00:57:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:15.910 --> 00:57:15.920 align:start position:0%
so okay so that that was my point number
 
00:57:19.109 --> 00:57:19.119 align:start position:0%
five right now we cannot discuss that in
 
00:57:23.029 --> 00:57:23.039 align:start position:0%
court unless by a little slip of the the
 
00:57:25.150 --> 00:57:25.160 align:start position:0%
tongue by the other person to open the
 
00:57:27.270 --> 00:57:27.280 align:start position:0%
door but only person with a really good
 
00:57:29.710 --> 00:57:29.720 align:start position:0%
attorney would notice that so my
 
00:57:33.510 --> 00:57:33.520 align:start position:0%
conclusion is please craft a bill
 
00:57:36.430 --> 00:57:36.440 align:start position:0%
totally rewrite it that will protect
 
00:57:40.349 --> 00:57:40.359 align:start position:0%
children from being raised by a parent
 
00:57:43.630 --> 00:57:43.640 align:start position:0%
who consistently puts the child
 
00:57:48.430 --> 00:57:48.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:51.470 --> 00:57:51.480 align:start position:0%
criticism that's a really hard subject
 
00:57:55.109 --> 00:57:55.119 align:start position:0%
to address and it is a very real issue
 
00:57:57.910 --> 00:57:57.920 align:start position:0%
that we don't have adequate wording we
 
00:57:59.870 --> 00:57:59.880 align:start position:0%
don't have adequate wording to address
 
00:58:02.589 --> 00:58:02.599 align:start position:0%
right now may I ask you the question of
 
00:58:07.109 --> 00:58:07.119 align:start position:0%
um where in the law is the things
 
00:58:11.510 --> 00:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:13.789 --> 00:58:13.799 align:start position:0%
prohibited so I can go look it up I can
 
00:58:17.670 --> 00:58:17.680 align:start position:0%
know well I wish I wish I knew that it's
 
00:58:19.510 --> 00:58:19.520 align:start position:0%
kind of hard to find things that are
 
00:58:21.870 --> 00:58:21.880 align:start position:0%
missing um it would strengthen your
 
00:58:24.589 --> 00:58:24.599 align:start position:0%
testimony when you say the law prohibits
 
00:58:26.910 --> 00:58:26.920 align:start position:0%
if you tell us where to look it up
 
00:58:29.870 --> 00:58:29.880 align:start position:0%
all I know is from practice from people
 
00:58:32.029 --> 00:58:32.039 align:start position:0%
who've been through Court who are not
 
00:58:34.789 --> 00:58:34.799 align:start position:0%
permitted who have not been permitted to
 
00:58:36.990 --> 00:58:37.000 align:start position:0%
bring it up and certainly I can ask
 
00:58:41.270 --> 00:58:41.280 align:start position:0%
questions and see if I can find which
 
00:58:41.280 --> 00:58:42.950 align:start position:0%
questions and see if I can find which
RSA

00:58:42.950 --> 00:58:42.960 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
00:58:45.750 --> 00:58:45.760 align:start position:0%
subparagraph delineates that that would
 
00:58:48.630 --> 00:58:48.640 align:start position:0%
be very helpful so what you are saying
 
00:58:52.670 --> 00:58:52.680 align:start position:0%
if I get you correctly is the reason it
 
00:58:55.750 --> 00:58:55.760 align:start position:0%
is not being brought up is in the Family
 
00:58:58.390 --> 00:58:58.400 align:start position:0%
Division Vision The Rules of Evidence
 
00:59:00.990 --> 00:59:01.000 align:start position:0%
are discretionary to the one presiding
 
00:59:03.309 --> 00:59:03.319 align:start position:0%
at the hearing is that your testimony
 
00:59:05.069 --> 00:59:05.079 align:start position:0%
that is true
 
00:59:08.510 --> 00:59:08.520 align:start position:0%
okay the other part of your question I
 
00:59:11.990 --> 00:59:12.000 align:start position:0%
don't I don't know if they did if they
 
00:59:15.190 --> 00:59:15.200 align:start position:0%
did choose to allow the testimony where
 
00:59:18.029 --> 00:59:18.039 align:start position:0%
would where would the prohibition be all
 
00:59:21.430 --> 00:59:21.440 align:start position:0%
I know is in actual practice of the law
 
00:59:23.990 --> 00:59:24.000 align:start position:0%
is not permitted thank you uh any other
 
00:59:26.270 --> 00:59:26.280 align:start position:0%
questions for the former represent
 
00:59:28.950 --> 00:59:28.960 align:start position:0%
resentative seeing none thank you and
 
00:59:34.630 --> 00:59:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:37.549 --> 00:59:37.559 align:start position:0%
research we will be executing this bill
 
00:59:40.109 --> 00:59:40.119 align:start position:0%
it's been advertised uh two weeks from
 
00:59:43.190 --> 00:59:43.200 align:start position:0%

representing the town of marac I'm here
 
01:01:47.230 --> 01:01:47.240 align:start position:0%
this morning to introduce HB 177 on
 
01:01:49.029 --> 01:01:49.039 align:start position:0%
behalf of a constituent special ed
 
01:01:51.150 --> 01:01:51.160 align:start position:0%
Advocate uh who discovered a need to
 
01:01:53.670 --> 01:01:53.680 align:start position:0%
clarify some language relative to RSA
 
01:01:56.950 --> 01:01:56.960 align:start position:0%
193 colon 27
 
01:02:00.910 --> 01:02:00.920 align:start position:0%
HP 177 simply restores the reference to
 
01:02:05.670 --> 01:02:05.680 align:start position:0%
RSA 193 colon 27 that was added through
 
01:02:09.230 --> 01:02:09.240 align:start position:0%
HB 1511 but that was then essentially
 
01:02:12.470 --> 01:02:12.480 align:start position:0%
removed when a second later bill hb1
 
01:02:14.789 --> 01:02:14.799 align:start position:0%
1639 went into
 
01:02:20.470 --> 01:02:20.480 align:start position:0%
effect two bills HB 1511 and HB 1639
 
01:02:23.430 --> 01:02:23.440 align:start position:0%
were introduced uh and passed last year
 
01:02:25.910 --> 01:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
both made changes to the same paragraph
 
01:02:30.150 --> 01:02:30.160 align:start position:0%
of RSA 186c New Hampshire special ed law
 
01:02:31.990 --> 01:02:32.000 align:start position:0%
uh with the first adding a reference to
 
01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:33.390 align:start position:0%
uh with the first adding a reference to
RSA

01:02:33.390 --> 01:02:33.400 align:start position:0%
RSA

01:02:42.630 --> 01:02:42.640 align:start position:0%
bill um I reached out to O last in
 
01:02:45.710 --> 01:02:45.720 align:start position:0%
August to make sure um that it was going
 
01:02:49.430 --> 01:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
to be a a an uh a bill would be required
 
01:02:53.150 --> 01:02:53.160 align:start position:0%
to correct this and um I was assured
 
01:02:55.910 --> 01:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
that it would indeed be required that
 
01:02:57.870 --> 01:02:57.880 align:start position:0%
that there was an oversight and that we
 
01:03:00.029 --> 01:03:00.039 align:start position:0%
had to do this legislatively so I filed
 
01:03:00.039 --> 01:03:00.630 align:start position:0%
had to do this legislatively so I filed
the

01:03:00.630 --> 01:03:00.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:03:05.789 --> 01:03:05.799 align:start position:0%
LSR um on July 1st HB 1511 which amended
 
01:03:08.190 --> 01:03:08.200 align:start position:0%
RSA 186c
 
01:03:12.390 --> 01:03:12.400 align:start position:0%

01:03:17.510 --> 01:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
went into effect just a few months later
 
01:03:20.230 --> 01:03:20.240 align:start position:0%
on October 1st hb1
 
01:03:24.269 --> 01:03:24.279 align:start position:0%
16639 which also amended RSA 186 C1 19B
 
01:03:28.029 --> 01:03:28.039 align:start position:0%
went into effect so from July 1st till
 
01:03:32.990 --> 01:03:33.000 align:start position:0%
October 1st the the language or 193

01:03:41.150 --> 01:03:41.160 align:start position:0%
was included in RSA 186 c19 B1 a then it
 
01:03:43.150 --> 01:03:43.160 align:start position:0%
was removed or just miraculously
 
01:03:47.470 --> 01:03:47.480 align:start position:0%
disappeared on October 1st when HB 1639
 
01:03:50.309 --> 01:03:50.319 align:start position:0%
went into effect further compounding
 
01:03:52.990 --> 01:03:53.000 align:start position:0%
things up till December 1st it remained
 
01:03:55.950 --> 01:03:55.960 align:start position:0%
that way and now all of a sudden there's
 
01:03:58.990 --> 01:03:59.000 align:start position:0%
change but not quite an exact change so
 
01:04:00.710 --> 01:04:00.720 align:start position:0%
really this really simply is a
 
01:04:03.870 --> 01:04:03.880 align:start position:0%
housekeeping bill which just clarifies
 
01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:04.789 align:start position:0%
housekeeping bill which just clarifies
and

01:04:04.789 --> 01:04:04.799 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:04:08.069 --> 01:04:08.079 align:start position:0%
distinguishes U what the bill should say
 
01:04:14.029 --> 01:04:14.039 align:start position:0%
um and I would ask that um you Pro i'
 
01:04:16.549 --> 01:04:16.559 align:start position:0%
request an OTP recommendation and I
 
01:04:18.349 --> 01:04:18.359 align:start position:0%
would thank you for your time for
 
01:04:22.390 --> 01:04:22.400 align:start position:0%
helping end this circuitous
 
01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:24.269 align:start position:0%
helping end this circuitous

01:04:28.710 --> 01:04:28.720 align:start position:0%
it is it is any
 
01:04:31.789 --> 01:04:31.799 align:start position:0%
questions look I'm only a one L I'm glad
 
01:04:33.829 --> 01:04:33.839 align:start position:0%
you gave me all of this stuff that's
 
01:04:35.309 --> 01:04:35.319 align:start position:0%
really the reita digest version of the
 
01:04:37.430 --> 01:04:37.440 align:start position:0%
whole thing with with the applicable
 
01:04:40.670 --> 01:04:40.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:43.029 --> 01:04:43.039 align:start position:0%
questions we are good and thank you and
 
01:04:47.190 --> 01:04:47.200 align:start position:0%
you can watch History made if you care
 
01:04:50.029 --> 01:04:50.039 align:start position:0%
to Jenny O Higgins signed a pink card in
 
01:04:51.870 --> 01:04:51.880 align:start position:0%
case we need clarifications I think
 
01:04:51.880 --> 01:04:53.029 align:start position:0%
case we need clarifications I think
we're

01:04:53.029 --> 01:04:53.039 align:start position:0%
we're
 
01:04:56.750 --> 01:04:56.760 align:start position:0%
clarification but you can come on up and
 
01:04:56.760 --> 01:04:58.680 align:start position:0%
clarification but you can come on up and
it's

01:04:58.680 --> 01:04:58.690 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:04:58.690 --> 01:05:06.510 align:start position:0%
it's
[Laughter]

01:05:06.510 --> 01:05:06.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:08.910 --> 01:05:08.920 align:start position:0%
billable good morning thank you I'm
 
01:05:10.630 --> 01:05:10.640 align:start position:0%
Jenny O Higgins and the legislative Le
 
01:05:13.309 --> 01:05:13.319 align:start position:0%
on for Behavioral Health at DHHS and
 
01:05:15.190 --> 01:05:15.200 align:start position:0%
again was just an optional speaker to
 
01:05:19.510 --> 01:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
provide info so we believed that the um
 
01:05:21.549 --> 01:05:21.559 align:start position:0%
the the the the statute actually wasn't
 
01:05:23.750 --> 01:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
really being changed because it already
 
01:05:25.710 --> 01:05:25.720 align:start position:0%
is listed in here today so I think
 
01:05:27.990 --> 01:05:28.000 align:start position:0%
hearing the the sponsor's testimony
 
01:05:30.190 --> 01:05:30.200 align:start position:0%
helps to clarify that maybe it's been
 
01:05:33.390 --> 01:05:33.400 align:start position:0%
removed and is looking to be Reed um we
 
01:05:35.109 --> 01:05:35.119 align:start position:0%
do not
 
01:05:38.390 --> 01:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
though episodes of treatment uh are not
 
01:05:41.670 --> 01:05:41.680 align:start position:0%
court ordered so where this is placed is
 
01:05:44.470 --> 01:05:44.480 align:start position:0%
somewhat confusing in terms of the
 
01:05:46.990 --> 01:05:47.000 align:start position:0%
Department's um fiscal analysis of the
 
01:05:49.109 --> 01:05:49.119 align:start position:0%
bill is that we they would not fall
 
01:05:51.150 --> 01:05:51.160 align:start position:0%
under the statute to begin with so I
 
01:05:53.230 --> 01:05:53.240 align:start position:0%
think that we could probably look
 
01:05:55.630 --> 01:05:55.640 align:start position:0%
through the research presented today and
 
01:05:57.470 --> 01:05:57.480 align:start position:0%
and talk with representative Murphy to
 
01:05:59.630 --> 01:05:59.640 align:start position:0%
make sure we're all clear since I've
 
01:06:01.990 --> 01:06:02.000 align:start position:0%
chaired DHHS oversight committee for the
 
01:06:04.190 --> 01:06:04.200 align:start position:0%
last five years you guys are up to the
 
01:06:06.390 --> 01:06:06.400 align:start position:0%
task of finding out what it means and
 
01:06:07.870 --> 01:06:07.880 align:start position:0%
even if it
 
01:06:11.390 --> 01:06:11.400 align:start position:0%
arguably rutly arguably is in the wrong
 
01:06:13.910 --> 01:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
spot correct we will get to the bottom
 
01:06:16.829 --> 01:06:16.839 align:start position:0%
of this I know it okay thank you for
 
01:06:19.390 --> 01:06:19.400 align:start position:0%

01:19:51.590 --> 01:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
I open the exact session on House Bill
 
01:19:55.550 --> 01:19:55.560 align:start position:0%
320 an act relative to enforcement of
 
01:19:57.950 --> 01:19:57.960 align:start position:0%
marital property settlements and the
 
01:20:01.430 --> 01:20:01.440 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative marel
 
01:20:05.390 --> 01:20:05.400 align:start position:0%
for a motion uh thank you Mr chairman
 
01:20:07.510 --> 01:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
yes um on this bill I would move that it
 
01:20:10.669 --> 01:20:10.679 align:start position:0%
ought to pass ought to pass and anyone
 
01:20:13.990 --> 01:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:27.550 --> 01:20:27.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:29.310 --> 01:20:29.320 align:start position:0%
and representative Martel would you like
 
01:20:32.830 --> 01:20:32.840 align:start position:0%
to convince us okay well um what this
 
01:20:35.669 --> 01:20:35.679 align:start position:0%
bill does is basically it require as the
 
01:20:38.229 --> 01:20:38.239 align:start position:0%
law stands right now there is no
 
01:20:39.790 --> 01:20:39.800 align:start position:0%
requirement that a court actually
 
01:20:42.030 --> 01:20:42.040 align:start position:0%
enforce its own orders relative to
 
01:20:44.189 --> 01:20:44.199 align:start position:0%
property settlements and divorce under
 
01:20:44.199 --> 01:20:45.510 align:start position:0%
property settlements and divorce under
RSA

01:20:45.510 --> 01:20:45.520 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
01:20:50.030 --> 01:20:50.040 align:start position:0%
458 I think it's 16 a uh what this bill
 
01:20:53.550 --> 01:20:53.560 align:start position:0%
does is set out measurable standards by
 
01:20:56.110 --> 01:20:56.120 align:start position:0%
which enforcement is required or to put
 
01:20:59.350 --> 01:20:59.360 align:start position:0%
the parties uh in the event an
 
01:21:01.149 --> 01:21:01.159 align:start position:0%
enforcement or contempt action is
 
01:21:03.990 --> 01:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
brought and what this does is is that it
 
01:21:07.709 --> 01:21:07.719 align:start position:0%
puts in measurable standards by which
 
01:21:10.310 --> 01:21:10.320 align:start position:0%
the parties in a court can understand
 
01:21:13.229 --> 01:21:13.239 align:start position:0%
whether an enforcement uh enforcement is
 
01:21:16.229 --> 01:21:16.239 align:start position:0%
warranted either in whole or in part uh
 
01:21:20.189 --> 01:21:20.199 align:start position:0%
and whether any portion of the um either
 
01:21:22.790 --> 01:21:22.800 align:start position:0%
agreement or court order decree is
 
01:21:25.270 --> 01:21:25.280 align:start position:0%
unenforceable for any of the specified
 
01:21:28.070 --> 01:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
reasons uh the specified reasons include
 
01:21:31.110 --> 01:21:31.120 align:start position:0%
but are not limited to invalidity due to
 
01:21:35.430 --> 01:21:35.440 align:start position:0%
duress Mutual mistake fraud deceit uh
 
01:21:39.629 --> 01:21:39.639 align:start position:0%
material non-disclosure coercion and or
 
01:21:42.470 --> 01:21:42.480 align:start position:0%
impossibility uh or illegality of
 
01:21:45.910 --> 01:21:45.920 align:start position:0%
subject matter um if for some reason it
 
01:21:48.990 --> 01:21:49.000 align:start position:0%
cannot be enforced exactly as written
 
01:21:51.030 --> 01:21:51.040 align:start position:0%
what the bill does is provide that the
 
01:21:53.870 --> 01:21:53.880 align:start position:0%
court can can create remedies that will
 
01:21:56.950 --> 01:21:56.960 align:start position:0%
put the party in the position as if the
 
01:21:59.030 --> 01:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
decree were fully were to be fully
 
01:22:01.550 --> 01:22:01.560 align:start position:0%
performed and the other nice thing about
 
01:22:04.790 --> 01:22:04.800 align:start position:0%
it is is that it lives out clear since
 
01:22:07.550 --> 01:22:07.560 align:start position:0%
we've repeatedly heard that uh
 
01:22:11.350 --> 01:22:11.360 align:start position:0%
Approximately 80% of the representative
 
01:22:13.950 --> 01:22:13.960 align:start position:0%
people who people who are in the Family
 
01:22:15.910 --> 01:22:15.920 align:start position:0%
Division are one of them is
 
01:22:18.189 --> 01:22:18.199 align:start position:0%
unrepresented what this bill is it lays
 
01:22:20.709 --> 01:22:20.719 align:start position:0%
out the standards by which somebody can
 
01:22:23.669 --> 01:22:23.679 align:start position:0%
effectively plead their case um and
 
01:22:25.629 --> 01:22:25.639 align:start position:0%
finally what it does is is that it
 
01:22:28.629 --> 01:22:28.639 align:start position:0%
provides a measurable yard stick uh in
 
01:22:30.669 --> 01:22:30.679 align:start position:0%
the event an appeal is
 
01:22:33.270 --> 01:22:33.280 align:start position:0%
necessary so once again I'm going to ask
 
01:22:37.030 --> 01:22:37.040 align:start position:0%
that the committee vote to ought to pass
 
01:22:37.040 --> 01:22:37.910 align:start position:0%
that the committee vote to ought to pass

01:22:46.870 --> 01:22:46.880 align:start position:0%

01:25:49.750 --> 01:25:49.760 align:start position:0%

diagnose and treat certain in numerous
 
01:25:56.510 --> 01:25:56.520 align:start position:0%
ated psychological conditions and would
 
01:25:58.990 --> 01:25:59.000 align:start position:0%
require a licensed psychologist to
 
01:26:01.030 --> 01:26:01.040 align:start position:0%
evaluate and file a risk assessment
 
01:26:03.669 --> 01:26:03.679 align:start position:0%
report in 8 weeks or less there is no
 
01:26:05.430 --> 01:26:05.440 align:start position:0%

01:26:07.830 --> 01:26:07.840 align:start position:0%
psychologists in this state who can or
 
01:26:09.550 --> 01:26:09.560 align:start position:0%
are willing to perform this kind of
 
01:26:11.910 --> 01:26:11.920 align:start position:0%
evaluate the kind of evaluations
 
01:26:14.350 --> 01:26:14.360 align:start position:0%
required by this bill further this
 
01:26:16.510 --> 01:26:16.520 align:start position:0%
bill's procedural requirements demand
 
01:26:18.629 --> 01:26:18.639 align:start position:0%
that a court order a risk assessment
 
01:26:20.990 --> 01:26:21.000 align:start position:0%
within 14 days of the initial Petition
 
01:26:23.189 --> 01:26:23.199 align:start position:0%
of divorce and fails to consider the
 
01:26:24.790 --> 01:26:24.800 align:start position:0%
large segment of children who were
 
01:26:27.030 --> 01:26:27.040 align:start position:0%
subject to Parenting petitions and not
 
01:26:30.189 --> 01:26:30.199 align:start position:0%
divorces so I once again ask that the
 
01:26:33.270 --> 01:26:33.280 align:start position:0%
bill considered itl didn't expedi until
 
01:26:35.590 --> 01:26:35.600 align:start position:0%
legislate anyone else wish to speak to
 
01:26:37.510 --> 01:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
it representative Raymond uh thank you
 
01:26:40.310 --> 01:26:40.320 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I just to add to um Mr
 
01:26:43.109 --> 01:26:43.119 align:start position:0%
marquel's concerns um I also have
 
01:26:46.470 --> 01:26:46.480 align:start position:0%
significant concerns about um how this
 
01:26:48.550 --> 01:26:48.560 align:start position:0%
bill impacts our bill that we passed
 
01:26:52.790 --> 01:26:52.800 align:start position:0%
last year saying that um that any uh
 
01:26:54.669 --> 01:26:54.679 align:start position:0%
Psychological Services ordered by a
 
01:26:57.470 --> 01:26:57.480 align:start position:0%
court have to be covered by the party's
 
01:27:00.310 --> 01:27:00.320 align:start position:0%
health insurance unless they both agree
 
01:27:03.390 --> 01:27:03.400 align:start position:0%
otherwise and in this case um the risk
 
01:27:05.189 --> 01:27:05.199 align:start position:0%
assessment that they're asking for
 
01:27:06.910 --> 01:27:06.920 align:start position:0%
cannot be covered by Insurance because
 
01:27:09.870 --> 01:27:09.880 align:start position:0%
it is not a recognized um service that
 
01:27:12.390 --> 01:27:12.400 align:start position:0%
is provided risk assessment in
 
01:27:15.470 --> 01:27:15.480 align:start position:0%
psychological circles terms means like a
 
01:27:17.350 --> 01:27:17.360 align:start position:0%
suicide risk assessment it doesn't mean
 
01:27:19.390 --> 01:27:19.400 align:start position:0%
any of the things that are listed here
 
01:27:21.470 --> 01:27:21.480 align:start position:0%
um and then I also have some quibbles
 
01:27:24.350 --> 01:27:24.360 align:start position:0%
with uh some Supreme Court cases uh that
 
01:27:27.390 --> 01:27:27.400 align:start position:0%
make this potentially unconstitutional
 
01:27:29.510 --> 01:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
so I I get where they're going but I
 
01:27:32.350 --> 01:27:32.360 align:start position:0%
concur with Mr marel thank
 
01:27:37.390 --> 01:27:37.400 align:start position:0%

wishes to second that representative D
 
01:37:03.310 --> 01:37:03.320 align:start position:0%
Simon and just read it again what it
 
01:37:06.870 --> 01:37:06.880 align:start position:0%
does is it establishes a pilot
 
01:37:10.149 --> 01:37:10.159 align:start position:0%
program so that uh
 
01:37:14.149 --> 01:37:14.159 align:start position:0%
the original bills
 
01:37:18.149 --> 01:37:18.159 align:start position:0%
intent May uh be looked at I I am going
 
01:37:19.990 --> 01:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
to assume that the ninth circuit has
 
01:37:21.709 --> 01:37:21.719 align:start position:0%
approved doing this and they're not
 
01:37:23.350 --> 01:37:23.360 align:start position:0%
going to wake up tomorrow realizing they
 
01:37:25.590 --> 01:37:25.600 align:start position:0%
got got to do it does anybody know that
 
01:37:29.470 --> 01:37:29.480 align:start position:0%
for sure or for certain sorry you know
 
01:37:31.030 --> 01:37:31.040 align:start position:0%
that unfortunately we've not had
 
01:37:33.189 --> 01:37:33.199 align:start position:0%
testimony on that so we can't we can't
 
01:37:35.669 --> 01:37:35.679 align:start position:0%
assume that unfortunately we've not
 
01:37:42.430 --> 01:37:42.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:44.910 --> 01:37:44.920 align:start position:0%
that there is no assertion that this is
 
01:37:47.550 --> 01:37:47.560 align:start position:0%
non gerain is
 
01:37:51.070 --> 01:37:51.080 align:start position:0%
there no it looks pretty germine to me
 
01:37:52.350 --> 01:37:52.360 align:start position:0%
all right it's just whether you like it
 
01:37:54.470 --> 01:37:54.480 align:start position:0%
or not okay I would assume somebody's
 
01:37:58.270 --> 01:37:58.280 align:start position:0%
done her homework on this
 
01:38:01.990 --> 01:38:02.000 align:start position:0%
um otherwise it just just dies there any
 
01:38:04.629 --> 01:38:04.639 align:start position:0%
discussion on this amendment
 
01:38:07.470 --> 01:38:07.480 align:start position:0%
representative deimon you want to jump
 
01:38:12.550 --> 01:38:12.560 align:start position:0%
in no yes representative Raymond thank
 
01:38:16.030 --> 01:38:16.040 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and I appreciate the um
 
01:38:18.149 --> 01:38:18.159 align:start position:0%
effort by the uh sponsors of the
 
01:38:19.709 --> 01:38:19.719 align:start position:0%
amendment to address some of the
 
01:38:21.390 --> 01:38:21.400 align:start position:0%
concerns that came out during the public
 
01:38:23.109 --> 01:38:23.119 align:start position:0%
hearing um I think there was a good
 
01:38:25.510 --> 01:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
faith effort here um I still think it
 
01:38:29.030 --> 01:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
falls short of addressing my most
 
01:38:32.229 --> 01:38:32.239 align:start position:0%
critical issue which is the right of the
 
01:38:34.270 --> 01:38:34.280 align:start position:0%
child to
 
01:38:37.750 --> 01:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
confidentiality um and so um just
 
01:38:39.990 --> 01:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
because I'm not aware that many of these
 
01:38:42.870 --> 01:38:42.880 align:start position:0%
cases are open but under on line 18
 
01:38:45.109 --> 01:38:45.119 align:start position:0%
Section 3 says nothing in this section
 
01:38:47.950 --> 01:38:47.960 align:start position:0%
prudes any person or media outlet from
 
01:38:50.030 --> 01:38:50.040 align:start position:0%
recording a Family Division proceeding
 
01:38:52.030 --> 01:38:52.040 align:start position:0%
according to existing Court
 
01:38:54.109 --> 01:38:54.119 align:start position:0%
administrative rules or order
 
01:38:56.950 --> 01:38:56.960 align:start position:0%
um and then it doesn't say anything
 
01:38:59.510 --> 01:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
about um the dispersement of the
 
01:39:01.750 --> 01:39:01.760 align:start position:0%
recording that a media or a random
 
01:39:04.270 --> 01:39:04.280 align:start position:0%
person might make um and I just really
 
01:39:06.270 --> 01:39:06.280 align:start position:0%
worry that this is going to end up in a
 
01:39:09.070 --> 01:39:09.080 align:start position:0%
situation where we have children whose
 
01:39:11.470 --> 01:39:11.480 align:start position:0%
information about domestic violence
 
01:39:13.430 --> 01:39:13.440 align:start position:0%
child abuse their medical their
 
01:39:16.229 --> 01:39:16.239 align:start position:0%
therapeutic records um any of that could
 
01:39:19.030 --> 01:39:19.040 align:start position:0%
get out on the internet forever and I
 
01:39:21.470 --> 01:39:21.480 align:start position:0%
just think that's wrong um so I can't
 
01:39:23.870 --> 01:39:23.880 align:start position:0%
support anything that would allow
 
01:39:27.669 --> 01:39:27.679 align:start position:0%
the recording and potential dispersement
 
01:39:35.189 --> 01:39:35.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:37.189 --> 01:39:37.199 align:start position:0%
information D
 
01:39:39.510 --> 01:39:39.520 align:start position:0%
Simone thank you Mr
 
01:39:41.950 --> 01:39:41.960 align:start position:0%
chairman we've heard quite a bit of
 
01:39:45.109 --> 01:39:45.119 align:start position:0%
testimony Through The Years concerning
 
01:39:48.550 --> 01:39:48.560 align:start position:0%
the issues of being able to uh
 
01:39:51.750 --> 01:39:51.760 align:start position:0%
record um proceedings in family court
 
01:39:55.030 --> 01:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
and the issues that uh constituents seem
 
01:39:59.510 --> 01:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
to have with what goes on in uh family
 
01:40:03.510 --> 01:40:03.520 align:start position:0%
court I think that the pilot
 
01:40:07.550 --> 01:40:07.560 align:start position:0%
program can at least give us more
 
01:40:11.350 --> 01:40:11.360 align:start position:0%
information to go on before we actually
 
01:40:16.229 --> 01:40:16.239 align:start position:0%
pass uh any laws that say that it will
 
01:40:20.669 --> 01:40:20.679 align:start position:0%
be in effect forever uh I I'd rather see
 
01:40:24.310 --> 01:40:24.320 align:start position:0%
a pilot program happen than to have
 
01:40:27.030 --> 01:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
nothing happen I think it's time we
 
01:40:28.589 --> 01:40:28.599 align:start position:0%
address the
 
01:40:32.790 --> 01:40:32.800 align:start position:0%
issue uh and help our
 
01:40:35.109 --> 01:40:35.119 align:start position:0%
constituents representative
 
01:40:37.629 --> 01:40:37.639 align:start position:0%
Petrino thank you Mr chairman Mr
 
01:40:39.830 --> 01:40:39.840 align:start position:0%
chairman I I thought that representative
 
01:40:42.070 --> 01:40:42.080 align:start position:0%
Raymond did a an excellent job
 
01:40:43.669 --> 01:40:43.679 align:start position:0%
articulating some of the concerns we
 
01:40:46.310 --> 01:40:46.320 align:start position:0%
have with the underlining Bill and uh
 
01:40:48.669 --> 01:40:48.679 align:start position:0%
which we at this moment can't support so
 
01:40:51.270 --> 01:40:51.280 align:start position:0%
having a pilot program to test out
 
01:40:53.310 --> 01:40:53.320 align:start position:0%
something that ultimately we're going to
 
01:40:55.910 --> 01:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
say no to without significant changes to
 
01:41:00.709 --> 01:41:00.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:04.270 --> 01:41:04.280 align:start position:0%
Point representative
 
01:41:07.830 --> 01:41:07.840 align:start position:0%
Sher thank you Mr chair uh I
 
01:41:10.189 --> 01:41:10.199 align:start position:0%
can't in addition to what representative
 
01:41:12.830 --> 01:41:12.840 align:start position:0%
Raymond said which I thought was uh very
 
01:41:14.950 --> 01:41:14.960 align:start position:0%
thoughtful I can't support a bill when
 
01:41:17.709 --> 01:41:17.719 align:start position:0%
we don't know whether the ninth circuit
 
01:41:19.709 --> 01:41:19.719 align:start position:0%
has been consulted on this I I would
 
01:41:22.870 --> 01:41:22.880 align:start position:0%
need even if I got over representative
 
01:41:25.750 --> 01:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
Raven ramen's uh problems uh I just
 
01:41:27.990 --> 01:41:28.000 align:start position:0%
can't we need to we would need to hear
 
01:41:29.430 --> 01:41:29.440 align:start position:0%
testimony from the court that they can
 
01:41:37.870 --> 01:41:37.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:41.070 --> 01:41:41.080 align:start position:0%
this representative Greg thank you Mr
 
01:41:43.390 --> 01:41:43.400 align:start position:0%
chairman so I think you know this goes
 
01:41:45.629 --> 01:41:45.639 align:start position:0%
back I can't of course we're discussing
 
01:41:47.910 --> 01:41:47.920 align:start position:0%
the amendment but it it really reflects
 
01:41:50.149 --> 01:41:50.159 align:start position:0%
on because it's a pilot program of what
 
01:41:52.030 --> 01:41:52.040 align:start position:0%
the bill States and so we already talked
 
01:41:54.350 --> 01:41:54.360 align:start position:0%
about the bill and the complications we
 
01:41:57.149 --> 01:41:57.159 align:start position:0%
have in these um in these court cases
 
01:41:59.990 --> 01:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
and persons not always being their best
 
01:42:01.830 --> 01:42:01.840 align:start position:0%
selves you know for things that can be
 
01:42:03.790 --> 01:42:03.800 align:start position:0%
out there and I agree with um what my
 
01:42:06.910 --> 01:42:06.920 align:start position:0%
colleague from nashaa said um as far as
 
01:42:09.510 --> 01:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
those things being out there also this
 
01:42:11.109 --> 01:42:11.119 align:start position:0%
right here under this amendment says
 
01:42:12.629 --> 01:42:12.639 align:start position:0%
that these recordings made under this
 
01:42:14.229 --> 01:42:14.239 align:start position:0%
section shall not be considered the
 
01:42:16.189 --> 01:42:16.199 align:start position:0%
official transcript that really is kind
 
01:42:18.109 --> 01:42:18.119 align:start position:0%
of the precipice for the people that
 
01:42:19.950 --> 01:42:19.960 align:start position:0%
wanted this bill in the first thing to
 
01:42:22.669 --> 01:42:22.679 align:start position:0%
have this official like document or
 
01:42:24.390 --> 01:42:24.400 align:start position:0%
whatever so it kind of deletes the
 
01:42:27.430 --> 01:42:27.440 align:start position:0%
purpose they wanted it for also it is my
 
01:42:29.870 --> 01:42:29.880 align:start position:0%
understanding that um judges do have
 
01:42:31.149 --> 01:42:31.159 align:start position:0%
their discretion whether or not
 
01:42:33.310 --> 01:42:33.320 align:start position:0%
something is recorded already and so
 
01:42:35.109 --> 01:42:35.119 align:start position:0%
there are certain times where people can
 
01:42:37.390 --> 01:42:37.400 align:start position:0%
record in with their cases and that that
 
01:42:40.149 --> 01:42:40.159 align:start position:0%
is an option so once again I think this
 
01:42:42.830 --> 01:42:42.840 align:start position:0%
is part of uh the Judiciary Branch I
 
01:42:45.149 --> 01:42:45.159 align:start position:0%
think that um what we're trying to do
 
01:42:47.950 --> 01:42:47.960 align:start position:0%
here is put a heavy regulation on them
 
01:42:50.910 --> 01:42:50.920 align:start position:0%
because of some high conflict situations
 
01:42:53.870 --> 01:42:53.880 align:start position:0%
we've heard about which are just not the
 
01:42:57.390 --> 01:42:57.400 align:start position:0%
um the greater um amount of them and I
 
01:42:59.149 --> 01:42:59.159 align:start position:0%
know we like to say well one or two
 
01:43:01.189 --> 01:43:01.199 align:start position:0%
cases could be too much but this is
 
01:43:02.709 --> 01:43:02.719 align:start position:0%
really a situation where if they are
 
01:43:05.550 --> 01:43:05.560 align:start position:0%
having issues with transcripts or um
 
01:43:07.790 --> 01:43:07.800 align:start position:0%
recording or anything that that that we
 
01:43:09.310 --> 01:43:09.320 align:start position:0%
have talked to them in our special
 
01:43:11.149 --> 01:43:11.159 align:start position:0%
committee about that and how that goes
 
01:43:13.070 --> 01:43:13.080 align:start position:0%
about and that's really an oversight for
 
01:43:14.589 --> 01:43:14.599 align:start position:0%
them this is not something that we need
 
01:43:17.430 --> 01:43:17.440 align:start position:0%
to be big brother with cameras in there
 
01:43:18.870 --> 01:43:18.880 align:start position:0%
I would like to underscore what the
 
01:43:21.390 --> 01:43:21.400 align:start position:0%
representative just said is that some of
 
01:43:23.709 --> 01:43:23.719 align:start position:0%
the bills we've been looking at here
 
01:43:27.109 --> 01:43:27.119 align:start position:0%
are things that can be addressed in
 
01:43:32.070 --> 01:43:32.080 align:start position:0%
depth um in a subcommittee on Family
 
01:43:33.709 --> 01:43:33.719 align:start position:0%
Court which will be
 
01:43:37.629 --> 01:43:37.639 align:start position:0%
created anything else by anybody else
 
01:43:40.870 --> 01:43:40.880 align:start position:0%
first second Raymond thank you Mr
 
01:43:43.990 --> 01:43:44.000 align:start position:0%
chairman um I just wanted to say that I
 
01:43:46.350 --> 01:43:46.360 align:start position:0%
think I know we're not considering the
 
01:43:48.189 --> 01:43:48.199 align:start position:0%
the love Amendment because it didn't get
 
01:43:50.950 --> 01:43:50.960 align:start position:0%
seconded um but one of the things that
 
01:43:53.910 --> 01:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
kept coming up was wanting a complete
 
01:43:57.229 --> 01:43:57.239 align:start position:0%
audio and video transcription and not
 
01:43:59.310 --> 01:43:59.320 align:start position:0%
having the judges have the ability to
 
01:44:02.109 --> 01:44:02.119 align:start position:0%
turn things on and off and I you know I
 
01:44:03.910 --> 01:44:03.920 align:start position:0%
think that that's something that really
 
01:44:06.350 --> 01:44:06.360 align:start position:0%
would get to the heart of the matter
 
01:44:08.430 --> 01:44:08.440 align:start position:0%
more than a pilot program letting
 
01:44:10.830 --> 01:44:10.840 align:start position:0%
somebody randomly off the street record
 
01:44:14.229 --> 01:44:14.239 align:start position:0%
these things so I I still have the same
 
01:44:18.470 --> 01:44:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:22.629 --> 01:44:22.639 align:start position:0%
Outlet anybody else motion before us uh
 
01:44:23.990 --> 01:44:24.000 align:start position:0%

01:44:30.310 --> 01:44:30.320 align:start position:0%

the report no it's a threat more a
 
01:48:48.109 --> 01:48:48.119 align:start position:0%

in the military and a way frequently
 
01:50:53.470 --> 01:50:53.480 align:start position:0%
during the first few years years of our
 
01:50:56.390 --> 01:50:56.400 align:start position:0%
marriage it was very
 
01:51:02.149 --> 01:51:02.159 align:start position:0%
difficult for me as his spouse to be
 
01:51:03.790 --> 01:51:03.800 align:start position:0%
home with
 
01:51:06.870 --> 01:51:06.880 align:start position:0%
children uh while he was away and he was
 
01:51:09.470 --> 01:51:09.480 align:start position:0%
never in any one spot for any length of
 
01:51:13.310 --> 01:51:13.320 align:start position:0%
time so I could not join him however
 
01:51:16.870 --> 01:51:16.880 align:start position:0%
most of the time today um that was
 
01:51:19.390 --> 01:51:19.400 align:start position:0%
during the Vietnam war but most of the
 
01:51:23.390 --> 01:51:23.400 align:start position:0%
time today uh the spouse is able to
 
01:51:30.390 --> 01:51:30.400 align:start position:0%
join um the uh military person and
 
01:51:34.310 --> 01:51:34.320 align:start position:0%
continue their marriage during that time
 
01:51:36.750 --> 01:51:36.760 align:start position:0%
uh and any children born of that
 
01:51:39.470 --> 01:51:39.480 align:start position:0%
marriage would immediately as a rule be
 
01:51:43.470 --> 01:51:43.480 align:start position:0%
able to meet their parent if we kind of
 
01:51:46.069 --> 01:51:46.079 align:start position:0%
take a look at this and you see uh a
 
01:51:47.830 --> 01:51:47.840 align:start position:0%
young person let's
 
01:51:52.669 --> 01:51:52.679 align:start position:0%
use the the scenario that the male of
 
01:51:55.310 --> 01:51:55.320 align:start position:0%
the marriage is in the military and the
 
01:51:57.470 --> 01:51:57.480 align:start position:0%
female is the
 
01:52:01.510 --> 01:52:01.520 align:start position:0%
17-year-old first of all the male at 17
 
01:52:05.350 --> 01:52:05.360 align:start position:0%
can join the military with his parents
 
01:52:05.360 --> 01:52:08.030 align:start position:0%
can join the military with his parents
consent

01:52:08.030 --> 01:52:08.040 align:start position:0%
consent
 
01:52:13.669 --> 01:52:13.679 align:start position:0%
um so if they were to marry uh the
 
01:52:16.229 --> 01:52:16.239 align:start position:0%
spouse would have to if they were not
 
01:52:19.030 --> 01:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
able to marry the potential spouse would
 
01:52:21.709 --> 01:52:21.719 align:start position:0%
have to stay home possibly give birth to
 
01:52:25.390 --> 01:52:25.400 align:start position:0%
a child who may not meet their father
 
01:52:29.149 --> 01:52:29.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:29.159 --> 01:52:30.870 align:start position:0%
 
years

01:52:30.870 --> 01:52:30.880 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:52:34.350 --> 01:52:34.360 align:start position:0%
because the spouse the parent the other
 
01:52:37.510 --> 01:52:37.520 align:start position:0%
parent of that child can't live on base
 
01:52:41.229 --> 01:52:41.239 align:start position:0%
with the uh the
 
01:52:44.149 --> 01:52:44.159 align:start position:0%
father it seems unfair to the child as
 
01:52:50.669 --> 01:52:50.679 align:start position:0%
well as the other person who may turn 18
 
01:52:53.069 --> 01:52:53.079 align:start position:0%
within a few months
 
01:52:55.470 --> 01:52:55.480 align:start position:0%
but I know for a fact when you're in
 
01:52:59.229 --> 01:52:59.239 align:start position:0%
basic training you cannot leave the base
 
01:53:02.189 --> 01:53:02.199 align:start position:0%
while you're in basic training so even
 
01:53:05.709 --> 01:53:05.719 align:start position:0%
if it's a week two weeks a month you
 
01:53:07.069 --> 01:53:07.079 align:start position:0%
cannot get
 
01:53:10.709 --> 01:53:10.719 align:start position:0%
married so I I just feel that this would
 
01:53:14.910 --> 01:53:14.920 align:start position:0%
create a an opportunity for good solid
 
01:53:16.669 --> 01:53:16.679 align:start position:0%
families you
 
01:53:21.069 --> 01:53:21.079 align:start position:0%
know the clock turns at midnight and
 
01:53:24.870 --> 01:53:24.880 align:start position:0%
makes you 18 the next day it's not magic
 
01:53:27.669 --> 01:53:27.679 align:start position:0%
that you all of a sudden become an
 
01:53:31.830 --> 01:53:31.840 align:start position:0%
adult you either are or you're not that
 
01:53:34.430 --> 01:53:34.440 align:start position:0%
magic clock doesn't make it that way
 
01:53:36.589 --> 01:53:36.599 align:start position:0%
it's who you are inside that makes it
 
01:53:39.270 --> 01:53:39.280 align:start position:0%
that way uh being married when I was
 
01:53:41.830 --> 01:53:41.840 align:start position:0%
just months after 18 didn't make me any
 
01:53:43.910 --> 01:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
more of an adult than I was when I was
 
01:53:47.870 --> 01:53:47.880 align:start position:0%
17 I was a mature adult
 
01:53:51.430 --> 01:53:51.440 align:start position:0%
period my husband was a mature adult
 
01:53:53.790 --> 01:53:53.800 align:start position:0%
period I just think this gives an
 
01:53:56.069 --> 01:53:56.079 align:start position:0%
opportunity to create good solid
 
01:53:59.589 --> 01:53:59.599 align:start position:0%
families thank you representative
 
01:54:02.390 --> 01:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
patrino thank you Mr
 
01:54:05.910 --> 01:54:05.920 align:start position:0%
chairman so more often than not what
 
01:54:08.709 --> 01:54:08.719 align:start position:0%
we're talking about here is uh the
 
01:54:12.950 --> 01:54:12.960 align:start position:0%
female spouse uh under the age of
 
01:54:17.470 --> 01:54:17.480 align:start position:0%
18 regardless she is still a minor at 17
 
01:54:20.350 --> 01:54:20.360 align:start position:0%
years old she is a minor and that's
 
01:54:22.109 --> 01:54:22.119 align:start position:0%
something I just cannot wrap my head
 
01:54:22.119 --> 01:54:23.109 align:start position:0%
something I just cannot wrap my head
around

01:54:23.109 --> 01:54:23.119 align:start position:0%
around
 
01:54:26.790 --> 01:54:26.800 align:start position:0%
how we can support having children get
 
01:54:29.030 --> 01:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
married regardless of any other
 
01:54:31.589 --> 01:54:31.599 align:start position:0%
circumstances again more often than not
 
01:54:33.990 --> 01:54:34.000 align:start position:0%
we are talking about a female under the
 
01:54:37.470 --> 01:54:37.480 align:start position:0%
age of 18 A minor thank you Mr
 
01:54:39.950 --> 01:54:39.960 align:start position:0%
chairman I might suggest that if this
 
01:54:43.950 --> 01:54:43.960 align:start position:0%
bill were to make 17year olds child
 
01:54:46.950 --> 01:54:46.960 align:start position:0%
Brides or Grooms it would also make
 
01:54:49.589 --> 01:54:49.599 align:start position:0%
17-year-old child
 
01:54:53.310 --> 01:54:53.320 align:start position:0%
soldiers may I respond to that please do
 
01:54:58.990 --> 01:54:59.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:01.270 --> 01:55:01.280 align:start position:0%
agree representative
 
01:55:04.390 --> 01:55:04.400 align:start position:0%
Craig thank you Mr chairman knowing that
 
01:55:07.709 --> 01:55:07.719 align:start position:0%
we just passed a bill last year that um
 
01:55:09.870 --> 01:55:09.880 align:start position:0%
that just became enacted we haven't even
 
01:55:12.669 --> 01:55:12.679 align:start position:0%
had a full two months of that yet and we
 
01:55:14.990 --> 01:55:15.000 align:start position:0%
had a lot of deliberation on what that
 
01:55:18.229 --> 01:55:18.239 align:start position:0%
was um and made the good decision that
 
01:55:20.109 --> 01:55:20.119 align:start position:0%
we wanted to raise the marriage age to
 
01:55:23.470 --> 01:55:23.480 align:start position:0%
18 um in this state we we've not seen
 
01:55:25.550 --> 01:55:25.560 align:start position:0%
any complications from this yet as a
 
01:55:28.510 --> 01:55:28.520 align:start position:0%
matter of fact the prime sponsor was a
 
01:55:31.109 --> 01:55:31.119 align:start position:0%
happen stance kind of a you know a
 
01:55:33.149 --> 01:55:33.159 align:start position:0%
madeup scenario that she thought could
 
01:55:35.430 --> 01:55:35.440 align:start position:0%
be a problem we haven't seen any real
 
01:55:39.109 --> 01:55:39.119 align:start position:0%
world problems from this um and so
 
01:55:41.229 --> 01:55:41.239 align:start position:0%
knowing that we all deliberated very
 
01:55:43.550 --> 01:55:43.560 align:start position:0%
hard that we came to good judgment that
 
01:55:46.270 --> 01:55:46.280 align:start position:0%
the world is not what it used to be back
 
01:55:48.470 --> 01:55:48.480 align:start position:0%
in the 50s 60s whenever people got
 
01:55:52.310 --> 01:55:52.320 align:start position:0%
married a lot younger um I I think that
 
01:55:55.310 --> 01:55:55.320 align:start position:0%
we are wise to stick with that until we
 
01:55:57.270 --> 01:55:57.280 align:start position:0%
have real complications I also want to
 
01:56:00.109 --> 01:56:00.119 align:start position:0%
say that having a service person who is
 
01:56:02.229 --> 01:56:02.239 align:start position:0%
not married who has a family does not
 
01:56:05.310 --> 01:56:05.320 align:start position:0%
mean they can't live with their family
 
01:56:07.030 --> 01:56:07.040 align:start position:0%
as a matter of fact the military makes
 
01:56:08.950 --> 01:56:08.960 align:start position:0%
it even for a single person you don't
 
01:56:10.750 --> 01:56:10.760 align:start position:0%
have to live on base they have something
 
01:56:13.149 --> 01:56:13.159 align:start position:0%
called basic allowance for housing where
 
01:56:15.229 --> 01:56:15.239 align:start position:0%
they actually provide that money they
 
01:56:16.950 --> 01:56:16.960 align:start position:0%
don't say is this your spouse or
 
01:56:18.430 --> 01:56:18.440 align:start position:0%
whatever they actually give you that
 
01:56:22.629 --> 01:56:22.639 align:start position:0%
allowance even back in the late '90s um
 
01:56:26.189 --> 01:56:26.199 align:start position:0%
I knew somebody that was in the military
 
01:56:28.270 --> 01:56:28.280 align:start position:0%
and they were just engaged and ended up
 
01:56:30.709 --> 01:56:30.719 align:start position:0%
getting uh pregnant but they were able
 
01:56:33.229 --> 01:56:33.239 align:start position:0%
to have this housing allowance off base
 
01:56:35.229 --> 01:56:35.239 align:start position:0%
it was not a problem they didn't have to
 
01:56:37.189 --> 01:56:37.199 align:start position:0%
be married so that's that's a problem
 
01:56:39.589 --> 01:56:39.599 align:start position:0%
that we kind of coming up with it really
 
01:56:41.350 --> 01:56:41.360 align:start position:0%
isn't a problem because the military is
 
01:56:43.149 --> 01:56:43.159 align:start position:0%
happy to take care of the families even
 
01:56:45.709 --> 01:56:45.719 align:start position:0%
if they're not unified in marriage yet
 
01:56:48.589 --> 01:56:48.599 align:start position:0%
so I would say that we should ideal
 
01:56:50.830 --> 01:56:50.840 align:start position:0%
this representative
 
01:56:56.709 --> 01:56:56.719 align:start position:0%
George thank you Mr chairman um I know
 
01:56:59.270 --> 01:56:59.280 align:start position:0%
the life we have today our all our
 
01:57:01.229 --> 01:57:01.239 align:start position:0%
mothers or what they married when they
 
01:57:06.069 --> 01:57:06.079 align:start position:0%
was young but today I saw a lot of girls
 
01:57:09.310 --> 01:57:09.320 align:start position:0%
who are suffering not because just from
 
01:57:12.550 --> 01:57:12.560 align:start position:0%
uh military but because to be married in
 
01:57:16.189 --> 01:57:16.199 align:start position:0%
the early age but they never do anything
 
01:57:19.270 --> 01:57:19.280 align:start position:0%
but they become a problem and uh where I
 
01:57:21.830 --> 01:57:21.840 align:start position:0%
came from they give they make a a young
 
01:57:24.709 --> 01:57:24.719 align:start position:0%
girl to be married but today I don't
 
01:57:28.750 --> 01:57:28.760 align:start position:0%
think so because they suffer a lot um
 
01:57:32.950 --> 01:57:32.960 align:start position:0%
leave make a 17 years old girl I don't
 
01:57:34.990 --> 01:57:35.000 align:start position:0%
know but as a mother I'm not going to
 
01:57:38.709 --> 01:57:38.719 align:start position:0%
accept for my children no that is not
 
01:57:41.109 --> 01:57:41.119 align:start position:0%
helping girls we need to help our
 
01:57:44.310 --> 01:57:44.320 align:start position:0%
children we are here to help to change
 
01:57:47.350 --> 01:57:47.360 align:start position:0%
um to be the the change agent if we want
 
01:57:49.910 --> 01:57:49.920 align:start position:0%
to be the best world we want to be for
 
01:57:52.629 --> 01:57:52.639 align:start position:0%
the best future for the our children we
 
01:57:55.270 --> 01:57:55.280 align:start position:0%
are the on supposed to make something to
 
01:57:57.629 --> 01:57:57.639 align:start position:0%
make them feel better we already have
 
01:58:00.669 --> 01:58:00.679 align:start position:0%
experienced ourself suffering why we
 
01:58:03.750 --> 01:58:03.760 align:start position:0%
going to let again the our our children
 
01:58:06.109 --> 01:58:06.119 align:start position:0%
to suffer because when you are 17 years
 
01:58:09.629 --> 01:58:09.639 align:start position:0%
old maybe when you become 20 25 is going
 
01:58:11.830 --> 01:58:11.840 align:start position:0%
to be divorced or they're going to be
 
01:58:14.069 --> 01:58:14.079 align:start position:0%
separate but you never finish you never
 
01:58:16.629 --> 01:58:16.639 align:start position:0%
do anything we the one you need to give
 
01:58:20.350 --> 01:58:20.360 align:start position:0%
U um ready fature for the children thank
 
01:58:20.360 --> 01:58:22.270 align:start position:0%
U um ready fature for the children thank
you

01:58:22.270 --> 01:58:22.280 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:58:22.280 --> 01:58:23.669 align:start position:0%
you
reprentative

01:58:23.669 --> 01:58:23.679 align:start position:0%
reprentative
 
01:58:26.629 --> 01:58:26.639 align:start position:0%
LC thank you Mr chair
 
01:58:30.589 --> 01:58:30.599 align:start position:0%
um I definitely don't support this bill
 
01:58:33.589 --> 01:58:33.599 align:start position:0%
mainly because I think that this could
 
01:58:36.069 --> 01:58:36.079 align:start position:0%
cause a lot of issues considering that
 
01:58:39.830 --> 01:58:39.840 align:start position:0%
at 17 they can still back out of the
 
01:58:43.470 --> 01:58:43.480 align:start position:0%
military it is a promise to go in and
 
01:58:45.830 --> 01:58:45.840 align:start position:0%
then at 18 if they continue that promise
 
01:58:47.550 --> 01:58:47.560 align:start position:0%
then they can join but they can still
 
01:58:49.870 --> 01:58:49.880 align:start position:0%
back out until they are 18 because you
 
01:58:53.510 --> 01:58:53.520 align:start position:0%
need a GED or a high school diploma and
 
01:58:56.750 --> 01:58:56.760 align:start position:0%
you need to pass each military Branch's
 
01:59:00.270 --> 01:59:00.280 align:start position:0%
test in order to join the military and
 
01:59:02.390 --> 01:59:02.400 align:start position:0%
there is no spousal housing at basic
 
01:59:04.830 --> 01:59:04.840 align:start position:0%
training you are basically housed in
 
01:59:07.470 --> 01:59:07.480 align:start position:0%
bunkers with your trunk that you take
 
01:59:09.709 --> 01:59:09.719 align:start position:0%
that are given to you and that is it you
 
01:59:11.790 --> 01:59:11.800 align:start position:0%
are not given spousal housing until
 
01:59:17.470 --> 01:59:17.480 align:start position:0%
after basic and my parents my dad's uh
 
01:59:20.790 --> 01:59:20.800 align:start position:0%
veteran of the Air Force my mom was a
 
01:59:23.830 --> 01:59:23.840 align:start position:0%
spouse and they always told me about all
 
01:59:26.189 --> 01:59:26.199 align:start position:0%
their stories and I just remember this
 
01:59:29.109 --> 01:59:29.119 align:start position:0%
one young girl my mom told me about who
 
01:59:32.750 --> 01:59:32.760 align:start position:0%
husband gave her frozen hamburgers to
 
01:59:35.229 --> 01:59:35.239 align:start position:0%
last until he came
 
01:59:38.390 --> 01:59:38.400 align:start position:0%
back she had a mental breakdown because
 
01:59:40.189 --> 01:59:40.199 align:start position:0%
she ran out of hamburgers and didn't
 
01:59:42.790 --> 01:59:42.800 align:start position:0%
know how to cook herself a full meal and
 
01:59:46.109 --> 01:59:46.119 align:start position:0%
she luckily had an intervention from a
 
01:59:49.350 --> 01:59:49.360 align:start position:0%
pastor who the other spouses saw
 
01:59:51.430 --> 01:59:51.440 align:start position:0%
something going on and suggested he go
 
01:59:52.910 --> 01:59:52.920 align:start position:0%
over to her house house where she had a
 
01:59:55.390 --> 01:59:55.400 align:start position:0%
full breakdown saying she ran out of
 
01:59:57.910 --> 01:59:57.920 align:start position:0%
hamburgers a couple days ago and didn't
 
01:59:59.510 --> 01:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
know what to do and didn't know if she
 
02:00:03.030 --> 02:00:03.040 align:start position:0%
was going to be able to have food until
 
02:00:05.550 --> 02:00:05.560 align:start position:0%
our husband came back because of his
 
02:00:05.560 --> 02:00:07.229 align:start position:0%
our husband came back because of his
extended

02:00:07.229 --> 02:00:07.239 align:start position:0%
extended
 
02:00:10.350 --> 02:00:10.360 align:start position:0%
deployment that is what is the reality
 
02:00:12.189 --> 02:00:12.199 align:start position:0%
of happening because we are sending
 
02:00:13.830 --> 02:00:13.840 align:start position:0%
young girls who are
 
02:00:16.950 --> 02:00:16.960 align:start position:0%
unprepared into a marriage I have
 
02:00:18.510 --> 02:00:18.520 align:start position:0%
friends who don't know how to do their
 
02:00:20.510 --> 02:00:20.520 align:start position:0%
own laundry I have friends who don't
 
02:00:22.430 --> 02:00:22.440 align:start position:0%
know how to make their own Mac and
 
02:00:25.189 --> 02:00:25.199 align:start position:0%
cheese at
 
02:00:25.199 --> 02:00:27.149 align:start position:0%
cheese at
25

02:00:27.149 --> 02:00:27.159 align:start position:0%
25
 
02:00:30.470 --> 02:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
I go to a college students campus at the
 
02:00:30.480 --> 02:00:31.350 align:start position:0%
I go to a college students campus at the
dry

02:00:31.350 --> 02:00:31.360 align:start position:0%
dry
 
02:00:33.870 --> 02:00:33.880 align:start position:0%
cleaners see how many students know how
 
02:00:35.990 --> 02:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
to do their own laundry it is
 
02:00:38.830 --> 02:00:38.840 align:start position:0%
astonishing cuz not many parents think I
 
02:00:41.350 --> 02:00:41.360 align:start position:0%
have to teach my 18-year-old how to do
 
02:00:44.589 --> 02:00:44.599 align:start position:0%
their own laundry but it is the truth I
 
02:00:46.550 --> 02:00:46.560 align:start position:0%
was nine when I went to the
 
02:00:50.510 --> 02:00:50.520 align:start position:0%
laundry um mat near my house and a man
 
02:00:52.149 --> 02:00:52.159 align:start position:0%
was surprised that I was doing my own
 
02:00:53.390 --> 02:00:53.400 align:start position:0%
laundry when some of the college
 
02:00:56.910 --> 02:00:56.920 align:start position:0%
students couldn't even do it at N9 so to
 
02:00:58.669 --> 02:00:58.679 align:start position:0%
think that they are mature enough to
 
02:01:01.709 --> 02:01:01.719 align:start position:0%
handle adult responsibility of their
 
02:01:05.709 --> 02:01:05.719 align:start position:0%
spouse away on deployment on basic and
 
02:01:08.030 --> 02:01:08.040 align:start position:0%
to be able to provide for their child to
 
02:01:10.830 --> 02:01:10.840 align:start position:0%
provide for themselves is
 
02:01:13.350 --> 02:01:13.360 align:start position:0%
astonishing and I don't think that this
 
02:01:16.510 --> 02:01:16.520 align:start position:0%
bill is the intent that the sponsor
 
02:01:16.520 --> 02:01:18.510 align:start position:0%
bill is the intent that the sponsor
really

02:01:18.510 --> 02:01:18.520 align:start position:0%
really
 
02:01:20.910 --> 02:01:20.920 align:start position:0%
wants representative
 
02:01:24.189 --> 02:01:24.199 align:start position:0%
sidel thank you Mr chairman I'm
 
02:01:28.470 --> 02:01:28.480 align:start position:0%
questioning how are we okay when parents
 
02:01:30.109 --> 02:01:30.119 align:start position:0%
have to give consent for their children
 
02:01:31.589 --> 02:01:31.599 align:start position:0%
to go off to war to go off to to the
 
02:01:33.830 --> 02:01:33.840 align:start position:0%
military and we're okay with that for
 
02:01:35.669 --> 02:01:35.679 align:start position:0%
when they're 17 if they're saying you're
 
02:01:37.629 --> 02:01:37.639 align:start position:0%
you're ready you're ready but we're not
 
02:01:40.750 --> 02:01:40.760 align:start position:0%
okay to say to the to another child if
 
02:01:42.189 --> 02:01:42.199 align:start position:0%
you're you're not mature enough to marry
 
02:01:44.189 --> 02:01:44.199 align:start position:0%
you're okay to go to war possibly lose
 
02:01:46.149 --> 02:01:46.159 align:start position:0%
your life fighting for your country
 
02:01:48.350 --> 02:01:48.360 align:start position:0%
handling Weaponry that we will never see
 
02:01:50.790 --> 02:01:50.800 align:start position:0%
in in the private sector but they're not
 
02:01:53.229 --> 02:01:53.239 align:start position:0%
okay to make a decision of marriage
 
02:01:54.750 --> 02:01:54.760 align:start position:0%
we're we're supposed to be trusting
 
02:01:56.870 --> 02:01:56.880 align:start position:0%
parents there are parents that that we
 
02:01:58.350 --> 02:01:58.360 align:start position:0%
can't trust to to raise their children
 
02:02:00.910 --> 02:02:00.920 align:start position:0%
but I the majority of parents use good
 
02:02:03.550 --> 02:02:03.560 align:start position:0%
judgment with parenting and I doubt very
 
02:02:05.990 --> 02:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
much would say go off and get married if
 
02:02:08.790 --> 02:02:08.800 align:start position:0%
I don't find you mature enough that's
 
02:02:11.790 --> 02:02:11.800 align:start position:0%
where I come from representative Raymond
 
02:02:14.510 --> 02:02:14.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman well actually the
 
02:02:17.229 --> 02:02:17.239 align:start position:0%
military doesn't send kids off toour at
 
02:02:20.390 --> 02:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
17 you can join basic you can join the
 
02:02:22.990 --> 02:02:23.000 align:start position:0%
military at 17 with parents permission
 
02:02:25.990 --> 02:02:26.000 align:start position:0%
but you cannot be deployed and it is not
 
02:02:29.270 --> 02:02:29.280 align:start position:0%
a permanent enlistment until you turn 18
 
02:02:32.189 --> 02:02:32.199 align:start position:0%
up until midnight on your the night
 
02:02:34.950 --> 02:02:34.960 align:start position:0%
before your 18th birthday 17year olds
 
02:02:37.750 --> 02:02:37.760 align:start position:0%
can change their mind legally in the
 
02:02:40.390 --> 02:02:40.400 align:start position:0%
military it doesn't happen very often
 
02:02:42.390 --> 02:02:42.400 align:start position:0%
but it is allowed and it's very clear I
 
02:02:44.069 --> 02:02:44.079 align:start position:0%
mean you can Google it it's out there
 
02:02:46.550 --> 02:02:46.560 align:start position:0%
it's very clear marriage isn't like that
 
02:02:49.189 --> 02:02:49.199 align:start position:0%
you can't like two weeks later be like
 
02:02:51.390 --> 02:02:51.400 align:start position:0%
oh this was a mistake and I regret it
 
02:02:53.830 --> 02:02:53.840 align:start position:0%
now there's a whole process um and for
 
02:02:56.430 --> 02:02:56.440 align:start position:0%
me I guess the bottom line is two things
 
02:02:58.470 --> 02:02:58.480 align:start position:0%
one I don't think we should reverse a
 
02:03:01.030 --> 02:03:01.040 align:start position:0%
bill that we just passed last year for
 
02:03:05.510 --> 02:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
very specific great reasons and two the
 
02:03:08.550 --> 02:03:08.560 align:start position:0%
testimony that we had here from the
 
02:03:11.830 --> 02:03:11.840 align:start position:0%
women who H our current military members
 
02:03:14.310 --> 02:03:14.320 align:start position:0%
who were married off at Young ages and
 
02:03:18.790 --> 02:03:18.800 align:start position:0%
had such horrific experiences I just
 
02:03:22.149 --> 02:03:22.159 align:start position:0%
feel like it would be incred I just I
 
02:03:25.229 --> 02:03:25.239 align:start position:0%
can't listen to their pain and then say
 
02:03:27.390 --> 02:03:27.400 align:start position:0%
well I think I know better than you
 
02:03:29.990 --> 02:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
what's out there I can't do it so I I
 
02:03:33.189 --> 02:03:33.199 align:start position:0%
cannot possibly support
 
02:03:35.990 --> 02:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
this representative
 
02:03:41.350 --> 02:03:41.360 align:start position:0%
Cen thank you Mr chairman um I I get
 
02:03:43.750 --> 02:03:43.760 align:start position:0%
lost in the weeds here when it when it
 
02:03:46.950 --> 02:03:46.960 align:start position:0%
comes to uh the fact that our state as a
 
02:03:50.549 --> 02:03:50.559 align:start position:0%
whole has decided that it's okay for a
 
02:03:52.350 --> 02:03:52.360 align:start position:0%
17-year-old to have
 
02:03:52.360 --> 02:03:54.030 align:start position:0%
17-year-old to have
sex

02:03:54.030 --> 02:03:54.040 align:start position:0%
sex
 
02:03:57.069 --> 02:03:57.079 align:start position:0%
um and that's perfectly acceptable as
 
02:03:59.310 --> 02:03:59.320 align:start position:0%
long as the person's within three three
 
02:04:02.430 --> 02:04:02.440 align:start position:0%
years of their age or what not it's
 
02:04:05.430 --> 02:04:05.440 align:start position:0%
consensual um so we're okay with letting
 
02:04:07.750 --> 02:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
them have sex but we're not okay with
 
02:04:09.750 --> 02:04:09.760 align:start position:0%
letting them get married to me that
 
02:04:12.549 --> 02:04:12.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:15.470 --> 02:04:15.480 align:start position:0%
sense anyone else wish to
 
02:04:17.629 --> 02:04:17.639 align:start position:0%
speak representative
 
02:04:21.189 --> 02:04:21.199 align:start position:0%
Nelson thank you Mr chairman I just
 
02:04:23.350 --> 02:04:23.360 align:start position:0%
wanted to does say that um this is a
 
02:04:27.149 --> 02:04:27.159 align:start position:0%
very specific and particular carve out
 
02:04:31.189 --> 02:04:31.199 align:start position:0%
that would um be utilized um very
 
02:04:34.510 --> 02:04:34.520 align:start position:0%
rarely and also the very very sad and
 
02:04:37.310 --> 02:04:37.320 align:start position:0%
awful um situation that occurred with um
 
02:04:40.270 --> 02:04:40.280 align:start position:0%
that one woman in particular who was
 
02:04:42.870 --> 02:04:42.880 align:start position:0%
married um at a young age to a military
 
02:04:44.910 --> 02:04:44.920 align:start position:0%
person she told us that that person was
 
02:04:49.390 --> 02:04:49.400 align:start position:0%
much older than than um she was and this
 
02:04:51.950 --> 02:04:51.960 align:start position:0%
would not happen in this case in the
 
02:04:53.950 --> 02:04:53.960 align:start position:0%
case of this Bill thank
 
02:04:57.109 --> 02:04:57.119 align:start position:0%
you ju just to clarify nothing in this
 
02:04:59.549 --> 02:04:59.559 align:start position:0%
bill prohibits representative Raymond
 
02:05:00.990 --> 02:05:01.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman sorry nothing in
 
02:05:04.030 --> 02:05:04.040 align:start position:0%
this bill prohibits someone of any age
 
02:05:06.750 --> 02:05:06.760 align:start position:0%
to marry a 17-year-old as long as that
 
02:05:09.030 --> 02:05:09.040 align:start position:0%
person's in the military we could have
 
02:05:11.390 --> 02:05:11.400 align:start position:0%
you know a 75-year-old man marry a
 
02:05:13.910 --> 02:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
17-year-old girl as long as that 75y old
 
02:05:16.709 --> 02:05:16.719 align:start position:0%
man was in the military based on the
 
02:05:18.549 --> 02:05:18.559 align:start position:0%
language of this bill I'm not going to
 
02:05:20.109 --> 02:05:20.119 align:start position:0%
do it I mean I I don't think it's a good
 
02:05:22.669 --> 02:05:22.679 align:start position:0%
idea but if the parents okay with it
 
02:05:25.310 --> 02:05:25.320 align:start position:0%
this bill says that's
 
02:05:28.750 --> 02:05:28.760 align:start position:0%
okay representative Greg thank you Mr
 
02:05:31.990 --> 02:05:32.000 align:start position:0%
chairman and to kind of like um reflect
 
02:05:34.109 --> 02:05:34.119 align:start position:0%
on uh the weeds part of this and how we
 
02:05:36.109 --> 02:05:36.119 align:start position:0%
have this consensual age at a certain
 
02:05:38.350 --> 02:05:38.360 align:start position:0%
age and then we we rais the marriage age
 
02:05:40.030 --> 02:05:40.040 align:start position:0%
first of all they're two very separate
 
02:05:41.629 --> 02:05:41.639 align:start position:0%
entities so when we're talking about the
 
02:05:43.390 --> 02:05:43.400 align:start position:0%
marriage we're only talking about that
 
02:05:44.870 --> 02:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the ability to be in
 
02:05:46.549 --> 02:05:46.559 align:start position:0%
a contract we're talking about the
 
02:05:48.950 --> 02:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
ability to be able to get Services as a
 
02:05:51.750 --> 02:05:51.760 align:start position:0%
minor um which even though we have this
 
02:05:54.750 --> 02:05:54.760 align:start position:0%
idea of unemancipated minor once they're
 
02:05:57.310 --> 02:05:57.320 align:start position:0%
married we do know that there are many
 
02:05:59.510 --> 02:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
shelters that will turn women away if
 
02:06:01.270 --> 02:06:01.280 align:start position:0%
they're not 18 because there are
 
02:06:04.350 --> 02:06:04.360 align:start position:0%
liabilities within this so that's this
 
02:06:07.030 --> 02:06:07.040 align:start position:0%
is more of a legal nature yes you know
 
02:06:09.510 --> 02:06:09.520 align:start position:0%
the choices that that we all make when
 
02:06:13.589 --> 02:06:13.599 align:start position:0%
we're younger can be um complicating
 
02:06:16.030 --> 02:06:16.040 align:start position:0%
however this is about legally binding
 
02:06:18.310 --> 02:06:18.320 align:start position:0%
documents we literally just passed this
 
02:06:20.589 --> 02:06:20.599 align:start position:0%
bill I mean this has been something that
 
02:06:22.589 --> 02:06:22.599 align:start position:0%
um representative has worked on for a
 
02:06:26.510 --> 02:06:26.520 align:start position:0%
very long time we were you know looked
 
02:06:29.189 --> 02:06:29.199 align:start position:0%
at as really making a forward effort
 
02:06:31.270 --> 02:06:31.280 align:start position:0%
because we understood too that in a day
 
02:06:34.189 --> 02:06:34.199 align:start position:0%
and age when we have much more um worry
 
02:06:35.830 --> 02:06:35.840 align:start position:0%
about sex trafficking and everything
 
02:06:38.470 --> 02:06:38.480 align:start position:0%
else we did not want to be a beacon for
 
02:06:40.350 --> 02:06:40.360 align:start position:0%
this for people to say oh well I can go
 
02:06:42.390 --> 02:06:42.400 align:start position:0%
here and marry a minor um there were a
 
02:06:44.470 --> 02:06:44.480 align:start position:0%
lot of things that went into this but
 
02:06:46.870 --> 02:06:46.880 align:start position:0%
certainly if if you want to raage raise
 
02:06:48.430 --> 02:06:48.440 align:start position:0%
the age of consent we need to look at
 
02:06:50.549 --> 02:06:50.559 align:start position:0%
that at a different a different time but
 
02:06:52.589 --> 02:06:52.599 align:start position:0%
this is this bill stand on its own with
 
02:06:54.310 --> 02:06:54.320 align:start position:0%
the problems that it
 
02:06:58.229 --> 02:06:58.239 align:start position:0%
has you representative deimon thank you
 
02:07:00.589 --> 02:07:00.599 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um I've heard a lot of
 
02:07:02.430 --> 02:07:02.440 align:start position:0%
discussion and with all due respect to
 
02:07:04.350 --> 02:07:04.360 align:start position:0%
the people who are very concerned about
 
02:07:08.750 --> 02:07:08.760 align:start position:0%
this number one um I was doing laundry
 
02:07:11.149 --> 02:07:11.159 align:start position:0%
and caring for my siblings when I was
 
02:07:14.310 --> 02:07:14.320 align:start position:0%
six so it has nothing to do with age as
 
02:07:17.790 --> 02:07:17.800 align:start position:0%
to whether uh you you know how to uh
 
02:07:19.109 --> 02:07:19.119 align:start position:0%
ration your
 
02:07:21.310 --> 02:07:21.320 align:start position:0%
hamburgers um the other thing that I've
 
02:07:25.229 --> 02:07:25.239 align:start position:0%
heard heard is that um a person under
 
02:07:28.390 --> 02:07:28.400 align:start position:0%
the age of 18 cannot go to a shelter and
 
02:07:30.390 --> 02:07:30.400 align:start position:0%
the shelters that in the state of New
 
02:07:32.709 --> 02:07:32.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that I called said they would
 
02:07:36.109 --> 02:07:36.119 align:start position:0%
absolutely be uh accepted into the
 
02:07:40.149 --> 02:07:40.159 align:start position:0%
shelter the other thing is that we have
 
02:07:43.390 --> 02:07:43.400 align:start position:0%
young women who are leaving their
 
02:07:46.589 --> 02:07:46.599 align:start position:0%
parents' homes and moving in with moving
 
02:07:52.069 --> 02:07:52.079 align:start position:0%
into homes with men who are are older
 
02:07:55.350 --> 02:07:55.360 align:start position:0%
than them and being abused left and
 
02:07:56.910 --> 02:07:56.920 align:start position:0%
right the
 
02:08:01.510 --> 02:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
cohabitation uh is of usually young
 
02:08:04.910 --> 02:08:04.920 align:start position:0%
women who are less mature than the woman
 
02:08:08.669 --> 02:08:08.679 align:start position:0%
who is going to make the decision of I
 
02:08:12.390 --> 02:08:12.400 align:start position:0%
want to marry the man I am going to be
 
02:08:14.709 --> 02:08:14.719 align:start position:0%
with that takes
 
02:08:18.510 --> 02:08:18.520 align:start position:0%
maturity there is a big difference
 
02:08:22.750 --> 02:08:22.760 align:start position:0%
we have to look at the very
 
02:08:27.549 --> 02:08:27.559 align:start position:0%
few I repeat the very few women who are
 
02:08:30.790 --> 02:08:30.800 align:start position:0%
going to want to enter into marriage
 
02:08:34.629 --> 02:08:34.639 align:start position:0%
with a person who is in the mil military
 
02:08:36.669 --> 02:08:36.679 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about hundreds of
 
02:08:40.229 --> 02:08:40.239 align:start position:0%
women we're talking very few those are
 
02:08:44.430 --> 02:08:44.440 align:start position:0%
women who are making a mature choice and
 
02:08:48.669 --> 02:08:48.679 align:start position:0%
lest we forget the bill does
 
02:08:53.189 --> 02:08:53.199 align:start position:0%
require written permission from a parent
 
02:08:57.629 --> 02:08:57.639 align:start position:0%
or legal guardian it's not that this kid
 
02:08:59.430 --> 02:08:59.440 align:start position:0%
can just go out on their own and get
 
02:09:01.549 --> 02:09:01.559 align:start position:0%
married they have to have permission
 
02:09:04.189 --> 02:09:04.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:08.069 --> 02:09:08.079 align:start position:0%
family thank you Mr Speaker Mr chairman
 
02:09:10.109 --> 02:09:10.119 align:start position:0%

02:09:12.030 --> 02:09:12.040 align:start position:0%
this so if anybody has anything new to
 
02:09:15.109 --> 02:09:15.119 align:start position:0%

02:09:24.750 --> 02:09:24.760 align:start position:0%
okay um thank you you Mr chair um I have
 
02:09:27.990 --> 02:09:28.000 align:start position:0%
been fighting this issue since I was 15
 
02:09:29.870 --> 02:09:29.880 align:start position:0%
the military argument has brought up
 
02:09:32.270 --> 02:09:32.280 align:start position:0%
time and time again and I just wanted to
 
02:09:33.709 --> 02:09:33.719 align:start position:0%
say that I
 
02:09:37.069 --> 02:09:37.079 align:start position:0%
have received so many stories I still
 
02:09:39.830 --> 02:09:39.840 align:start position:0%
receive stories of people from the
 
02:09:42.229 --> 02:09:42.239 align:start position:0%
streets I
 
02:09:42.239 --> 02:09:43.870 align:start position:0%
streets I
W

02:09:43.870 --> 02:09:43.880 align:start position:0%
W
 
02:09:46.950 --> 02:09:46.960 align:start position:0%
just saying that their parents gave
 
02:09:51.109 --> 02:09:51.119 align:start position:0%
permission for them to be married at 16
 
02:09:51.119 --> 02:09:52.870 align:start position:0%
permission for them to be married at 16
at

02:09:52.870 --> 02:09:52.880 align:start position:0%
at
 
02:09:57.189 --> 02:09:57.199 align:start position:0%
17 and they were married off to a man
 
02:09:59.350 --> 02:09:59.360 align:start position:0%
that they did not love that they feared
 
02:10:01.790 --> 02:10:01.800 align:start position:0%
for the however many years that they
 
02:10:05.589 --> 02:10:05.599 align:start position:0%
were married and it wasn't until they
 
02:10:07.870 --> 02:10:07.880 align:start position:0%
reached a certain age that they realize
 
02:10:09.990 --> 02:10:10.000 align:start position:0%
I can leave and sometimes they have to
 
02:10:12.589 --> 02:10:12.599 align:start position:0%
leave their kids Behind which they never
 
02:10:14.790 --> 02:10:14.800 align:start position:0%
want to do no Mom wants to make the
 
02:10:18.069 --> 02:10:18.079 align:start position:0%
choice between my life and my kids life
 
02:10:20.470 --> 02:10:20.480 align:start position:0%
of that situation but sometimes there
 
02:10:22.870 --> 02:10:22.880 align:start position:0%
are parents parents there are mothers
 
02:10:25.149 --> 02:10:25.159 align:start position:0%
that have to leave their kids behind
 
02:10:27.470 --> 02:10:27.480 align:start position:0%
because their husband is so abusive some
 
02:10:30.390 --> 02:10:30.400 align:start position:0%
of them haven't seen their kids in years
 
02:10:33.510 --> 02:10:33.520 align:start position:0%
and I'm just afraid that this would open
 
02:10:37.549 --> 02:10:37.559 align:start position:0%
up the door of abuse and neglect when it
 
02:10:40.189 --> 02:10:40.199 align:start position:0%
comes to these childrens that we do not
 
02:10:42.910 --> 02:10:42.920 align:start position:0%
want in this state and also there is no
 
02:10:46.870 --> 02:10:46.880 align:start position:0%
active duty military base in New England
 
02:10:52.470 --> 02:10:52.480 align:start position:0%

02:16:36.309 --> 02:16:36.319 align:start position:0%
Greg oh I apologize I'm sorry I did give
 
02:16:39.709 --> 02:16:39.719 align:start position:0%
you another cl to help me
 
02:16:45.190 --> 02:16:45.200 align:start position:0%
yes um just so briefly um this C the
 
02:16:49.030 --> 02:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
topic of amending um this RSA came about
 
02:16:54.429 --> 02:16:54.439 align:start position:0%
from one of my um constituents who had
 
02:16:58.309 --> 02:16:58.319 align:start position:0%
um had um guardianship um of her
 
02:17:00.629 --> 02:17:00.639 align:start position:0%
grandchildren um at different times
 
02:17:04.509 --> 02:17:04.519 align:start position:0%
because of their mother's struggles and
 
02:17:08.110 --> 02:17:08.120 align:start position:0%
when I researched it I found out that um
 
02:17:11.270 --> 02:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
we have up to 12,000 grandparents who
 
02:17:14.629 --> 02:17:14.639 align:start position:0%
are raising their grandchildren um
 
02:17:17.750 --> 02:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
having permanent or temporary uh
 
02:17:20.309 --> 02:17:20.319 align:start position:0%
guardianship custody and we also
 
02:17:23.870 --> 02:17:23.880 align:start position:0%
realized that we have um a really big
 
02:17:27.309 --> 02:17:27.319 align:start position:0%
problem with um substance abuse disorder
 
02:17:29.429 --> 02:17:29.439 align:start position:0%
and we also know that although the goal
 
02:17:32.110 --> 02:17:32.120 align:start position:0%
is reunification with the parents uh it
 
02:17:36.709 --> 02:17:36.719 align:start position:0%
can be a bumpy road um for recovery so
 
02:17:39.990 --> 02:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
um this bill really
 
02:17:46.709 --> 02:17:46.719 align:start position:0%
just adds language that um enables um a
 
02:17:49.990 --> 02:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
grandparent or grandparents to have
 
02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:53.629 align:start position:0%
grandparent or grandparents to have
positive

02:17:53.629 --> 02:17:53.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:53.639 --> 02:17:55.190 align:start position:0%
 
consistent

02:17:55.190 --> 02:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
consistent
 
02:17:58.030 --> 02:17:58.040 align:start position:0%
relationships with the grandchild
 
02:18:00.110 --> 02:18:00.120 align:start position:0%
because it's in the best interest of the
 
02:18:04.589 --> 02:18:04.599 align:start position:0%
grandchild and it also um gives a little
 
02:18:09.270 --> 02:18:09.280 align:start position:0%
bit of help with the judges um because
 
02:18:09.280 --> 02:18:10.990 align:start position:0%
bit of help with the judges um because
um

02:18:10.990 --> 02:18:11.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:14.230 --> 02:18:14.240 align:start position:0%
the word divorce um was being
 
02:18:16.790 --> 02:18:16.800 align:start position:0%
interpreted several different ways so I
 
02:18:20.349 --> 02:18:20.359 align:start position:0%
I helped um add a little bit of language
 
02:18:23.309 --> 02:18:23.319 align:start position:0%
that will help um determine uh whether
 
02:18:25.070 --> 02:18:25.080 align:start position:0%
um grandparents should have a visitation
 
02:18:27.509 --> 02:18:27.519 align:start position:0%
or not also just wanted to make it
 
02:18:31.110 --> 02:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
really clear that I also kept in mind
 
02:18:33.669 --> 02:18:33.679 align:start position:0%
and very carefully tread on the fact
 
02:18:36.070 --> 02:18:36.080 align:start position:0%
that I realize that it is a parents
 
02:18:38.270 --> 02:18:38.280 align:start position:0%
constitutional right to uh make
 
02:18:42.110 --> 02:18:42.120 align:start position:0%
decisions about their children and so um
 
02:18:45.469 --> 02:18:45.479 align:start position:0%
also wanted to mention that this bill
 
02:18:45.479 --> 02:18:47.589 align:start position:0%
also wanted to mention that this bill
was

02:18:47.589 --> 02:18:47.599 align:start position:0%
was
 
02:18:52.349 --> 02:18:52.359 align:start position:0%
um two um big parental rights folks in
 
02:18:55.030 --> 02:18:55.040 align:start position:0%

representative for work on this I think
 
02:19:07.669 --> 02:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
this strikes a good balance with uh
 
02:19:09.150 --> 02:19:09.160 align:start position:0%
understanding that parents should have
 
02:19:11.309 --> 02:19:11.319 align:start position:0%
that um that first right in healthy
 
02:19:13.309 --> 02:19:13.319 align:start position:0%
situations but also understanding that
 
02:19:16.230 --> 02:19:16.240 align:start position:0%
grandparents um do uh and can play a
 
02:19:18.910 --> 02:19:18.920 align:start position:0%

03:12:39.630 --> 03:12:39.640 align:start position:0%
representative D Simone is the one that
 
03:12:43.150 --> 03:12:43.160 align:start position:0%
put the amendment together so and and
 
03:12:46.349 --> 03:12:46.359 align:start position:0%
I've read it and I understand it but I
 
03:12:48.469 --> 03:12:48.479 align:start position:0%
don't understand it like she does seeing
 
03:12:49.670 --> 03:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
that she's been sitting on this
 
03:12:52.389 --> 03:12:52.399 align:start position:0%
committee for a number of years and
 
03:12:55.550 --> 03:12:55.560 align:start position:0%
instead of me fumbling through it I am
 
03:12:57.830 --> 03:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
going to let representative D Simone go
 
03:13:00.070 --> 03:13:00.080 align:start position:0%
through the amendment so everybody
 
03:13:03.229 --> 03:13:03.239 align:start position:0%
completely understands it remember what
 
03:13:05.830 --> 03:13:05.840 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm asking for is the committee to
 
03:13:07.950 --> 03:13:07.960 align:start position:0%
accept the amendment when you go into

term so I've only been at it for 17
 
03:13:39.870 --> 03:13:39.880 align:start position:0%
years and I say that kind of tongue and
 
03:13:43.150 --> 03:13:43.160 align:start position:0%
cheek because um parents have been at it
 
03:13:45.229 --> 03:13:45.239 align:start position:0%
a lot longer than
 
03:13:47.550 --> 03:13:47.560 align:start position:0%
I um when I

read um House Bill
 
03:13:53.950 --> 03:13:53.960 align:start position:0%

03:14:04.389 --> 03:14:04.399 align:start position:0%
past I really became very concerned that
 
03:14:06.910 --> 03:14:06.920 align:start position:0%
we have not been able to pass a bill and
 
03:14:11.269 --> 03:14:11.279 align:start position:0%
I went over every single word every
 
03:14:15.550 --> 03:14:15.560 align:start position:0%
period every comma every T has been
 
03:14:18.309 --> 03:14:18.319 align:start position:0%
crossed the purpose of this bill is to
 
03:14:20.830 --> 03:14:20.840 align:start position:0%

and education while in school
 
03:14:42.950 --> 03:14:42.960 align:start position:0%
custody I use the word custody only
 
03:14:47.510 --> 03:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
because children are with Educators for
 
03:14:51.630 --> 03:14:51.640 align:start position:0%
six or more hours in a day
 
03:14:55.830 --> 03:14:55.840 align:start position:0%

on course content clubs and

not to coincide with their moral or
 
03:18:17.710 --> 03:18:17.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:19.950 --> 03:18:19.960 align:start position:0%
the Schoolboard responsibility should be
 
03:18:23.269 --> 03:18:23.279 align:start position:0%
to inform parents of their rights and
 
03:18:27.110 --> 03:18:27.120 align:start position:0%

basis parental parents should have the
 
03:18:38.670 --> 03:18:38.680 align:start position:0%
right to health care services and
 
03:18:41.750 --> 03:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
require written
 
03:18:45.309 --> 03:18:45.319 align:start position:0%
consent for both parents and caregivers
 
03:18:48.070 --> 03:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
givers for the health care services to
 
03:18:52.269 --> 03:18:52.279 align:start position:0%
include medical procedures except in
 
03:18:55.309 --> 03:18:55.319 align:start position:0%
emergencies all parents should be able
 
03:18:59.670 --> 03:18:59.680 align:start position:0%
to decide whether their child receives
 
03:19:03.189 --> 03:19:03.199 align:start position:0%
certain medical procedures or
 
03:19:06.550 --> 03:19:06.560 align:start position:0%
not as far as a fiscal
 
03:19:10.550 --> 03:19:10.560 align:start position:0%
impact um the fiscal fiscal impact is
 
03:19:13.309 --> 03:19:13.319 align:start position:0%
not really to be part of the general
 
03:19:16.990 --> 03:19:17.000 align:start position:0%
talking points to the caucus because it
 
03:19:22.309 --> 03:19:22.319 align:start position:0%
it's really not necessary to to include
 
03:19:25.710 --> 03:19:25.720 align:start position:0%
that there should be no new funding or
 
03:19:30.070 --> 03:19:30.080 align:start position:0%
positions authorized there's an inter
 
03:19:32.349 --> 03:19:32.359 align:start position:0%
indeterminable increase in state
 
03:19:34.590 --> 03:19:34.600 align:start position:0%
expenditures due to potential increase
 
03:19:36.189 --> 03:19:36.199 align:start position:0%
in legal
 
03:19:40.070 --> 03:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
complaints and appeals so these changes
 
03:19:42.309 --> 03:19:42.319 align:start position:0%
that I've made to
 
03:19:45.630 --> 03:19:45.640 align:start position:0%
um the original House Bill 10 I wanted
 
03:19:49.349 --> 03:19:49.359 align:start position:0%
you to all have them because it really
 
03:19:51.670 --> 03:19:51.680 align:start position:0%
tightened up the language it gives
 
03:19:54.710 --> 03:19:54.720 align:start position:0%
parents the rights to parent their
 
03:19:57.990 --> 03:19:58.000 align:start position:0%
children that should never be
 
03:20:01.750 --> 03:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
questioned thank you for your time Mr
 
03:20:06.189 --> 03:20:06.199 align:start position:0%
chairman will you accept questions
 
03:20:09.670 --> 03:20:09.680 align:start position:0%
absolutely is it true that this current
 
03:20:12.950 --> 03:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
amendment is in part in response to
 
03:20:15.229 --> 03:20:15.239 align:start position:0%
concerns that people had had with the
 
03:20:17.990 --> 03:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
original bills so that the intent is to
 
03:20:21.990 --> 03:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:25.349 --> 03:20:25.359 align:start position:0%
Bill yes Mr chairman I mean I I filed
 
03:20:28.309 --> 03:20:28.319 align:start position:0%
that bill initially so that we could
 
03:20:30.990 --> 03:20:31.000 align:start position:0%
take a look at it and analyze it and
 
03:20:34.070 --> 03:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
come up with an amendment you know I
 
03:20:35.429 --> 03:20:35.439 align:start position:0%
didn't know if we have to change the
 
03:20:37.269 --> 03:20:37.279 align:start position:0%
whole thing at the time or change pieces
 
03:20:41.710 --> 03:20:41.720 align:start position:0%
of it uh it it seems that we've um I
 
03:20:43.990 --> 03:20:44.000 align:start position:0%
know representative D Simone and others
 
03:20:46.229 --> 03:20:46.239 align:start position:0%
on this committee yourself included have
 
03:20:48.710 --> 03:20:48.720 align:start position:0%
worked for a a lot put a lot of hours
 
03:20:53.150 --> 03:20:53.160 align:start position:0%
into doing this and um so that's
 
03:20:56.990 --> 03:20:57.000 align:start position:0%
um where we're at um the original Bill
 
03:20:59.910 --> 03:20:59.920 align:start position:0%
had flaws I think those flaws are being
 
03:21:03.309 --> 03:21:03.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:07.429 --> 03:21:07.439 align:start position:0%
of one of my day jobs is being part-time
 
03:21:11.429 --> 03:21:11.439 align:start position:0%
CEO of a medical center and my wife is a
 
03:21:14.150 --> 03:21:14.160 align:start position:0%
family practice physician and something
 
03:21:17.790 --> 03:21:17.800 align:start position:0%
that we have long ago disc discovered is
 
03:21:20.150 --> 03:21:20.160 align:start position:0%
there is a lot of misunderstanding as to
 
03:21:23.150 --> 03:21:23.160 align:start position:0%
what Hippa is and people sometimes
 
03:21:24.670 --> 03:21:24.680 align:start position:0%
whether they know they're doing it
 
03:21:27.030 --> 03:21:27.040 align:start position:0%
intentionally or not will say oh I
 
03:21:31.110 --> 03:21:31.120 align:start position:0%
cannot tell you because of HIPPA um this
 
03:21:32.950 --> 03:21:32.960 align:start position:0%
question is to either one of you has
 
03:21:36.469 --> 03:21:36.479 align:start position:0%
that been your experience that um Hippa
 
03:21:40.670 --> 03:21:40.680 align:start position:0%
is invoked perhaps
 
03:21:44.110 --> 03:21:44.120 align:start position:0%
inappropriately uh honestly Mr chairman
 
03:21:46.189 --> 03:21:46.199 align:start position:0%
my daughter graduated from high school
 
03:21:49.269 --> 03:21:49.279 align:start position:0%
quite a few years ago and it was uh kind
 
03:21:53.229 --> 03:21:53.239 align:start position:0%
of preh hipper so uh I uh I personally
 
03:21:56.030 --> 03:21:56.040 align:start position:0%
have not been affected by it I I cannot
 
03:22:00.110 --> 03:22:00.120 align:start position:0%
speak for representative nimon but uh uh
 
03:22:02.830 --> 03:22:02.840 align:start position:0%
I if I correct it wasn't around when uh
 
03:22:08.590 --> 03:22:08.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:12.590 --> 03:22:12.600 align:start position:0%

Hippa but my grandchildren are and
 
03:22:32.830 --> 03:22:32.840 align:start position:0%
uh I would
 
03:22:36.910 --> 03:22:36.920 align:start position:0%
not be amenable to somebody not giving
 
03:22:38.750 --> 03:22:38.760 align:start position:0%
my daughter and
 
03:22:41.229 --> 03:22:41.239 align:start position:0%
son-in-law both my daughters and

03:22:47.070 --> 03:22:47.080 align:start position:0%
grandchildren and their health care it
 
03:22:49.150 --> 03:22:49.160 align:start position:0%
it just isn't right and uh
 
03:22:49.160 --> 03:22:50.950 align:start position:0%
it just isn't right and uh
representative

03:22:50.950 --> 03:22:50.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:22:53.189 --> 03:22:53.199 align:start position:0%
marel I was just trying to look it up
 
03:22:55.990 --> 03:22:56.000 align:start position:0%
but it is in the amendment
 
03:23:00.269 --> 03:23:00.279 align:start position:0%
um representative marel uh worked on
 
03:23:02.990 --> 03:23:03.000 align:start position:0%
verbiage to
 
03:23:03.000 --> 03:23:05.389 align:start position:0%
verbiage to
um

03:23:05.389 --> 03:23:05.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:23:10.630 --> 03:23:10.640 align:start position:0%
allow for um this bill to Encompass
 
03:23:14.750 --> 03:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
verbiage to give parents the right to
 
03:23:17.469 --> 03:23:17.479 align:start position:0%
have their children's um medical records
 
03:23:21.110 --> 03:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:24.550 --> 03:23:24.560 align:start position:0%
them representative Greg thank you Mr
 
03:23:26.710 --> 03:23:26.720 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you Mr Speaker and
 
03:23:29.150 --> 03:23:29.160 align:start position:0%
Madame Vice chair for um explaining the
 
03:23:32.030 --> 03:23:32.040 align:start position:0%
amendment and the bill I I have a couple
 
03:23:33.670 --> 03:23:33.680 align:start position:0%
questions so I'll try to do one and then
 
03:23:36.590 --> 03:23:36.600 align:start position:0%
do a follow-up so is this only trying to
 
03:23:39.389 --> 03:23:39.399 align:start position:0%
codify uh parental rights because I
 
03:23:41.150 --> 03:23:41.160 align:start position:0%
actually everything that you said I've
 
03:23:42.710 --> 03:23:42.720 align:start position:0%
been able to do with my own children's
 
03:23:45.110 --> 03:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
upbringing without having this codified
 
03:23:47.590 --> 03:23:47.600 align:start position:0%
but is this just codifying for public
 
03:23:50.110 --> 03:23:50.120 align:start position:0%
schools or is it also in private like
 
03:23:51.950 --> 03:23:51.960 align:start position:0%
these parents what I'm seeing is the
 
03:23:53.670 --> 03:23:53.680 align:start position:0%
parents have the rights
 
03:23:56.110 --> 03:23:56.120 align:start position:0%
in uh Public Schools you're giving it
 
03:23:57.429 --> 03:23:57.439 align:start position:0%
that but not in the private school
 
03:23:59.750 --> 03:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
settings is that correct or does this
 
03:24:03.469 --> 03:24:03.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:06.550 --> 03:24:06.560 align:start position:0%
somehow it will extend to both it will
 
03:24:08.590 --> 03:24:08.600 align:start position:0%
extend to public private and religious
 
03:24:10.870 --> 03:24:10.880 align:start position:0%
schools okay followup followup thank you
 
03:24:13.630 --> 03:24:13.640 align:start position:0%
for the followup also it says that um
 
03:24:15.630 --> 03:24:15.640 align:start position:0%
when you're talking about what uh
 
03:24:17.630 --> 03:24:17.640 align:start position:0%
parents will be able to get it says this
 
03:24:19.710 --> 03:24:19.720 align:start position:0%
is on page this new amendment I think
 
03:24:21.670 --> 03:24:21.680 align:start position:0%
I'm I hope I'm on the right Amendment uh
 
03:24:23.830 --> 03:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
page four line
 
03:24:26.189 --> 03:24:26.199 align:start position:0%
14 it says the right of a parent to
 
03:24:28.510 --> 03:24:28.520 align:start position:0%
inspect School District instructional
 
03:24:31.630 --> 03:24:31.640 align:start position:0%
materials the way that it's worded um
 
03:24:33.670 --> 03:24:33.680 align:start position:0%
the right of a parent but not the parent
 
03:24:35.630 --> 03:24:35.640 align:start position:0%
does this mean because I know that we've
 
03:24:38.550 --> 03:24:38.560 align:start position:0%
had certainly we've had an uptick in
 
03:24:40.189 --> 03:24:40.199 align:start position:0%
people complaining to school boards in
 
03:24:42.070 --> 03:24:42.080 align:start position:0%
the last years but they tend to travel
 
03:24:43.550 --> 03:24:43.560 align:start position:0%
there are some that will travel all over
 
03:24:45.630 --> 03:24:45.640 align:start position:0%
the state so does this mean any parent
 
03:24:47.830 --> 03:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
can go to any school and start to
 
03:24:51.630 --> 03:24:51.640 align:start position:0%
request this information it it does not
 
03:24:54.750 --> 03:24:54.760 align:start position:0%
it means that a parent in and the reason
 
03:24:58.150 --> 03:24:58.160 align:start position:0%
that I use that is that there as we know
 
03:25:00.790 --> 03:25:00.800 align:start position:0%
families come in all shapes and sizes
 
03:25:03.750 --> 03:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
nowadays uh and they may be one or more
 
03:25:06.550 --> 03:25:06.560 align:start position:0%
parents in the home so it doesn't have
 
03:25:08.630 --> 03:25:08.640 align:start position:0%
to be both parents it doesn't have to be
 
03:25:12.710 --> 03:25:12.720 align:start position:0%
one parent or the other it could be a
 
03:25:15.590 --> 03:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
parent follow up but the the way that
 
03:25:16.790 --> 03:25:16.800 align:start position:0%
I'm reading it because because the law
 
03:25:19.070 --> 03:25:19.080 align:start position:0%
is so specific and the gray area always
 
03:25:21.189 --> 03:25:21.199 align:start position:0%
goes you know to the wrong side here so
 
03:25:23.950 --> 03:25:23.960 align:start position:0%
it just says the right of a parent not
 
03:25:25.990 --> 03:25:26.000 align:start position:0%
like the parent of the student or
 
03:25:27.269 --> 03:25:27.279 align:start position:0%
particular student it just says the
 
03:25:29.670 --> 03:25:29.680 align:start position:0%
right of a parent so what I'm reading
 
03:25:31.830 --> 03:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
this too is that I'm just looking at the
 
03:25:33.429 --> 03:25:33.439 align:start position:0%
the big ramifications and maybe
 
03:25:35.550 --> 03:25:35.560 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences that this could
 
03:25:37.309 --> 03:25:37.319 align:start position:0%
be any parent so I'm a parent so I can
 
03:25:39.349 --> 03:25:39.359 align:start position:0%
go up to North Country and say what are
 
03:25:41.750 --> 03:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
you guys doing here or you know in the
 
03:25:44.150 --> 03:25:44.160 align:start position:0%
South like start comparing and stuff I'm
 
03:25:46.469 --> 03:25:46.479 align:start position:0%
just wondering if you plan to specify
 
03:25:46.479 --> 03:25:47.469 align:start position:0%
just wondering if you plan to specify
that

03:25:47.469 --> 03:25:47.479 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:25:50.030 --> 03:25:50.040 align:start position:0%
more so actually you could what if
 
03:25:51.590 --> 03:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
you're trying to move to the North
 
03:25:53.550 --> 03:25:53.560 align:start position:0%
country and you want to check out the
 
03:25:56.229 --> 03:25:56.239 align:start position:0%
school system you want to go in and you
 
03:25:59.070 --> 03:25:59.080 align:start position:0%
want to say I am a
 
03:26:02.590 --> 03:26:02.600 align:start position:0%
parent of a stu of a potential student I
 
03:26:05.950 --> 03:26:05.960 align:start position:0%
want to know what your curriculum
 
03:26:09.510 --> 03:26:09.520 align:start position:0%
is other questions representative
 
03:26:12.630 --> 03:26:12.640 align:start position:0%
Raymond thank you Mr chairman um and
 
03:26:14.150 --> 03:26:14.160 align:start position:0%
thank you both for being here and taking
 
03:26:17.870 --> 03:26:17.880 align:start position:0%
my question um I noticed that um there
 
03:26:20.110 --> 03:26:20.120 align:start position:0%
was a lot of changes from last year and
 
03:26:22.030 --> 03:26:22.040 align:start position:0%
I sincerely appreciate all of the work
 
03:26:24.790 --> 03:26:24.800 align:start position:0%
that has been done um I still have a
 
03:26:27.790 --> 03:26:27.800 align:start position:0%
question about the medical records
 
03:26:29.309 --> 03:26:29.319 align:start position:0%
section because we have another bill in
 
03:26:31.030 --> 03:26:31.040 align:start position:0%
front of this committee about accessing
 
03:26:32.830 --> 03:26:32.840 align:start position:0%
medical records and we got quite a bit
 
03:26:36.150 --> 03:26:36.160 align:start position:0%
of testimony about um what medical
 
03:26:39.870 --> 03:26:39.880 align:start position:0%
records are and are not um accessible to
 
03:26:42.309 --> 03:26:42.319 align:start position:0%
parents under both New Hampshire
 
03:26:45.950 --> 03:26:45.960 align:start position:0%
statutes and federal statutes so my
 
03:26:50.229 --> 03:26:50.239 align:start position:0%
question question is how does this new
 
03:26:54.469 --> 03:26:54.479 align:start position:0%
paragraph um intersect with the the laws
 
03:26:56.150 --> 03:26:56.160 align:start position:0%
that we currently have on the books that
 
03:26:59.710 --> 03:26:59.720 align:start position:0%
say that once you're 14 and older you
 
03:27:03.429 --> 03:27:03.439 align:start position:0%
can voluntarily consent for STDs um
 
03:27:07.229 --> 03:27:07.239 align:start position:0%
that's uh RSA 141 c18 and the ones that
 
03:27:10.910 --> 03:27:10.920 align:start position:0%
say that um you know that that
 
03:27:13.710 --> 03:27:13.720 align:start position:0%
children's uh therapeutic records are
 
03:27:16.229 --> 03:27:16.239 align:start position:0%
deemed confidentiality confidential and
 
03:27:18.309 --> 03:27:18.319 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court case is saying that
 
03:27:19.950 --> 03:27:19.960 align:start position:0%
parents don't have the right to wave
 
03:27:22.309 --> 03:27:22.319 align:start position:0%
confidentiality for their child in those
 
03:27:26.030 --> 03:27:26.040 align:start position:0%
cases so how does this language on page
 
03:27:29.469 --> 03:27:29.479 align:start position:0%
two starting at number 19 of the
 
03:27:32.349 --> 03:27:32.359 align:start position:0%
amendment um intersect with those
 
03:27:38.590 --> 03:27:38.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:38.600 --> 03:27:43.030 align:start position:0%
 
level

03:27:43.030 --> 03:27:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:48.710 --> 03:27:48.720 align:start position:0%
well um it does intersect uh because if
 
03:27:52.070 --> 03:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
you apply and and representative marel
 
03:27:54.710 --> 03:27:54.720 align:start position:0%
can answer this in Legally Le better
 
03:27:58.469 --> 03:27:58.479 align:start position:0%
than I uh and he was my consultant on
 
03:28:03.389 --> 03:28:03.399 align:start position:0%
this uh as um Mr Speaker stated I
 
03:28:08.990 --> 03:28:09.000 align:start position:0%
consulted many many experts so how this
 
03:28:10.910 --> 03:28:10.920 align:start position:0%
intersects is
 
03:28:12.990 --> 03:28:13.000 align:start position:0%
that uh at
 
03:28:18.309 --> 03:28:18.319 align:start position:0%
Birth a parent can uh file the paperwork
 
03:28:21.030 --> 03:28:21.040 align:start position:0%
and and representative marel can correct
 
03:28:24.309 --> 03:28:24.319 align:start position:0%
wherever I Stray on this to become a
 
03:28:31.630 --> 03:28:31.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:34.790 --> 03:28:34.800 align:start position:0%
child representative marel thank you Mr
 
03:28:36.830 --> 03:28:36.840 align:start position:0%
chairman for taking my my question I
 
03:28:38.269 --> 03:28:38.279 align:start position:0%
guess this is going to be way of a
 
03:28:41.990 --> 03:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
supplemental answer perhaps um one of
 
03:28:43.349 --> 03:28:43.359 align:start position:0%
the things and and by the way to
 
03:28:45.510 --> 03:28:45.520 align:start position:0%
directly address your your your question
 
03:28:47.349 --> 03:28:47.359 align:start position:0%
you're raised some good points because
 
03:28:49.429 --> 03:28:49.439 align:start position:0%
there are inherent conflicts in the law
 
03:28:51.630 --> 03:28:51.640 align:start position:0%
when you're dealing with child's records
 
03:28:54.630 --> 03:28:54.640 align:start position:0%
I think one of the lead cases you may be
 
03:28:58.030 --> 03:28:58.040 align:start position:0%
interested in is in re Berg it's from uh
 
03:29:00.389 --> 03:29:00.399 align:start position:0%
2005 it's a New Hampshire Supreme Court
 
03:29:03.150 --> 03:29:03.160 align:start position:0%
case okay and it deals with the
 
03:29:05.670 --> 03:29:05.680 align:start position:0%
confidentiality of children's records
 
03:29:09.670 --> 03:29:09.680 align:start position:0%
okay uh bear in mind that very few
 
03:29:11.990 --> 03:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
things in law at least in my experience
 
03:29:16.110 --> 03:29:16.120 align:start position:0%
as an attorney are absolute okay and
 
03:29:18.630 --> 03:29:18.640 align:start position:0%
when you're dealing in a situation where
 
03:29:21.229 --> 03:29:21.239 align:start position:0%
there's either going to be uh a custody
 
03:29:23.189 --> 03:29:23.199 align:start position:0%
battle or there's a competing State
 
03:29:25.229 --> 03:29:25.239 align:start position:0%
interest which is exactly what Berg
 
03:29:27.590 --> 03:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
deals with and the accessibility of
 
03:29:30.110 --> 03:29:30.120 align:start position:0%
Records what it says that the key
 
03:29:32.349 --> 03:29:32.359 align:start position:0%
Holdings in regard to what you have
 
03:29:34.950 --> 03:29:34.960 align:start position:0%
there is is that children have a right
 
03:29:37.189 --> 03:29:37.199 align:start position:0%
to have a therapeutic privilege under
 
03:29:40.870 --> 03:29:40.880 align:start position:0%
rsa3 I think it's 330 A2 I think and
 
03:29:44.550 --> 03:29:44.560 align:start position:0%
what it said was is that the the
 
03:29:48.510 --> 03:29:48.520 align:start position:0%
privilege the privilege um relationship
 
03:29:51.550 --> 03:29:51.560 align:start position:0%
in terms of in terms of privilege okay
 
03:29:54.510 --> 03:29:54.520 align:start position:0%
children can qualify for that so if
 
03:29:57.030 --> 03:29:57.040 align:start position:0%
you're dealing in an adverse situation
 
03:29:59.429 --> 03:29:59.439 align:start position:0%
or where there's going to be custody
 
03:30:02.070 --> 03:30:02.080 align:start position:0%
issues or things like that the state can
 
03:30:04.389 --> 03:30:04.399 align:start position:0%
step in and exercise that competing
 
03:30:08.189 --> 03:30:08.199 align:start position:0%
interest and can deny parents access to
 
03:30:12.110 --> 03:30:12.120 align:start position:0%
those records now that said that is not
 
03:30:14.630 --> 03:30:14.640 align:start position:0%
all the time that's if you're in a court
 
03:30:16.790 --> 03:30:16.800 align:start position:0%
situation I mean bear in mind that
 
03:30:20.389 --> 03:30:20.399 align:start position:0%
parental rights are not absolute so for
 
03:30:24.429 --> 03:30:24.439 align:start position:0%
example if you are in a situation where
 
03:30:28.189 --> 03:30:28.199 align:start position:0%
you're in an intact family there are no
 
03:30:30.510 --> 03:30:30.520 align:start position:0%
custody proceedings no divorces no
 
03:30:32.670 --> 03:30:32.680 align:start position:0%
parenting petitions things like that
 
03:30:34.550 --> 03:30:34.560 align:start position:0%
these are Under normal circumstances
 
03:30:36.870 --> 03:30:36.880 align:start position:0%
where you would be able to access those
 
03:30:40.830 --> 03:30:40.840 align:start position:0%
those records so um that right only gets
 
03:30:43.349 --> 03:30:43.359 align:start position:0%
reduced and the competing State interest
 
03:30:46.229 --> 03:30:46.239 align:start position:0%
comes into into play basically in three
 
03:30:48.469 --> 03:30:48.479 align:start position:0%
areas one if there's going to be
 
03:30:50.550 --> 03:30:50.560 align:start position:0%
allegations of abuse or neglect because
 
03:30:52.110 --> 03:30:52.120 align:start position:0%
you do not have the right to abuse or
 
03:30:54.950 --> 03:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
neglect your child number two is is that
 
03:30:58.189 --> 03:30:58.199 align:start position:0%
if you voluntarily invite the state in
 
03:31:00.429 --> 03:31:00.439 align:start position:0%
which means that you either are not
 
03:31:02.349 --> 03:31:02.359 align:start position:0%
married and you file a parenting
 
03:31:05.070 --> 03:31:05.080 align:start position:0%
petition for your children okay or three
 
03:31:06.309 --> 03:31:06.319 align:start position:0%
that you're married and there's going to
 
03:31:08.830 --> 03:31:08.840 align:start position:0%
be a divorce proceedings then the state
 
03:31:10.309 --> 03:31:10.319 align:start position:0%
can intervene and make sure it's
 
03:31:12.110 --> 03:31:12.120 align:start position:0%
protecting the interests of the children
 
03:31:15.030 --> 03:31:15.040 align:start position:0%
so these apply generally and so when you
 
03:31:17.189 --> 03:31:17.199 align:start position:0%
look also specifically at the terms
 
03:31:19.389 --> 03:31:19.399 align:start position:0%
personal Representatives when you look
 
03:31:23.110 --> 03:31:23.120 align:start position:0%
at hipa okay hipa is not in my reading
 
03:31:25.590 --> 03:31:25.600 align:start position:0%
is not preemptive which means it does
 
03:31:28.269 --> 03:31:28.279 align:start position:0%
not occupy the entire field of law as
 
03:31:30.229 --> 03:31:30.239 align:start position:0%
your question accurately points out
 
03:31:32.630 --> 03:31:32.640 align:start position:0%
because there are other state statutes
 
03:31:34.830 --> 03:31:34.840 align:start position:0%
so when you look at that this basically
 
03:31:37.510 --> 03:31:37.520 align:start position:0%
says a parental parental rep
 
03:31:39.189 --> 03:31:39.199 align:start position:0%
representation as the child's
 
03:31:41.349 --> 03:31:41.359 align:start position:0%
representative should under many
 
03:31:44.150 --> 03:31:44.160 align:start position:0%
circumstances be able to Grant you the
 
03:31:46.349 --> 03:31:46.359 align:start position:0%
access of the records and like I said
 
03:31:48.630 --> 03:31:48.640 align:start position:0%
once again these are Under normal
 
03:31:50.790 --> 03:31:50.800 align:start position:0%
circumstances exceptions here for
 
03:31:53.269 --> 03:31:53.279 align:start position:0%
example stand up particularly when you
 
03:31:55.670 --> 03:31:55.680 align:start position:0%
look at allegations of um law
 
03:31:57.389 --> 03:31:57.399 align:start position:0%
enforcement investigation a crime
 
03:32:00.309 --> 03:32:00.319 align:start position:0%
committed against a child or for example
 
03:32:02.229 --> 03:32:02.239 align:start position:0%
if there is going to be something along
 
03:32:04.110 --> 03:32:04.120 align:start position:0%
the lines of a court order which limits
 
03:32:07.590 --> 03:32:07.600 align:start position:0%
that access now all that said to show
 
03:32:09.630 --> 03:32:09.640 align:start position:0%
you exactly how convoluted this this is
 
03:32:11.750 --> 03:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
trying to make it simple because it
 
03:32:14.030 --> 03:32:14.040 align:start position:0%
because nothing in law is going to be
 
03:32:16.830 --> 03:32:16.840 align:start position:0%
simple for the most part so when you
 
03:32:18.990 --> 03:32:19.000 align:start position:0%
look at it for example if you have a
 
03:32:21.870 --> 03:32:21.880 align:start position:0%
guardian at Liam come into a case Okay
 
03:32:23.429 --> 03:32:23.439 align:start position:0%
where somebody is appointed to represent
 
03:32:25.070 --> 03:32:25.080 align:start position:0%
the best interest of the children and
 
03:32:26.870 --> 03:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
there may be therapeutic or Physicians
 
03:32:28.189 --> 03:32:28.199 align:start position:0%
records that otherwise would be
 
03:32:30.830 --> 03:32:30.840 align:start position:0%
privileged nevertheless a court can have
 
03:32:32.870 --> 03:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
the authority to allow a guardian adem
 
03:32:34.710 --> 03:32:34.720 align:start position:0%
to wave the child's privilege and be
 
03:32:36.830 --> 03:32:36.840 align:start position:0%
able to obtain the records so the
 
03:32:39.110 --> 03:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
concise answer is this would be
 
03:32:42.269 --> 03:32:42.279 align:start position:0%
applicable most of the time okay but not
 
03:32:45.150 --> 03:32:45.160 align:start position:0%
all of the time representative Raymond
 
03:32:47.269 --> 03:32:47.279 align:start position:0%
followup uh thank you thank you Mr
 
03:32:48.790 --> 03:32:48.800 align:start position:0%
chairman and um thank you for the
 
03:32:52.229 --> 03:32:52.239 align:start position:0%
clarity so to believer the point a
 
03:32:55.790 --> 03:32:55.800 align:start position:0%
little bit this makes an exception for
 
03:32:58.269 --> 03:32:58.279 align:start position:0%
if there is a crime an investigation of
 
03:33:00.389 --> 03:33:00.399 align:start position:0%
a crime committed against the child what
 
03:33:02.110 --> 03:33:02.120 align:start position:0%
about those situations that we heard
 
03:33:03.990 --> 03:33:04.000 align:start position:0%
about in testimony last year about the
 
03:33:07.910 --> 03:33:07.920 align:start position:0%
medical records where a a child is in is
 
03:33:10.469 --> 03:33:10.479 align:start position:0%
is telling her medical provider like if
 
03:33:12.870 --> 03:33:12.880 align:start position:0%
you tell my mom or my dad that I have
 
03:33:14.349 --> 03:33:14.359 align:start position:0%
asked for birth control I'm thinking a
 
03:33:17.429 --> 03:33:17.439 align:start position:0%
16 or 17y old this is going to result in
 
03:33:20.910 --> 03:33:20.920 align:start position:0%
me being abused or neglected at home in
 
03:33:24.830 --> 03:33:24.840 align:start position:0%
the P currently as it stands the um
 
03:33:27.790 --> 03:33:27.800 align:start position:0%
physician would then possibly make a DCF
 
03:33:31.150 --> 03:33:31.160 align:start position:0%
report but also you know hold on to
 
03:33:34.269 --> 03:33:34.279 align:start position:0%
those records until DCF does its job
 
03:33:37.550 --> 03:33:37.560 align:start position:0%
under this I don't see a carve out for
 
03:33:41.030 --> 03:33:41.040 align:start position:0%
the physici to be able to say I have an
 
03:33:42.670 --> 03:33:42.680 align:start position:0%
allegation that has caused me to be
 
03:33:45.349 --> 03:33:45.359 align:start position:0%
concerned enough to call DCF can I hold
 
03:33:47.830 --> 03:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
this record until I get that because I
 
03:33:49.469 --> 03:33:49.479 align:start position:0%
don't it's not bad enough to call the
 
03:33:51.309 --> 03:33:51.319 align:start position:0%
cops because it hasn't happened yet but
 
03:33:53.229 --> 03:33:53.239 align:start position:0%
it's bad enough that they their mandated
 
03:33:55.830 --> 03:33:55.840 align:start position:0%
reporter law kicks in is there like what
 
03:33:58.349 --> 03:33:58.359 align:start position:0%
happens when you look at the last line
 
03:34:00.110 --> 03:34:00.120 align:start position:0%
it says it's a misdemeanor at that point
 
03:34:03.110 --> 03:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
for the position to say whoa slow down
 
03:34:05.309 --> 03:34:05.319 align:start position:0%
let's let DCF talk to the family before
 
03:34:07.950 --> 03:34:07.960 align:start position:0%
we release these records right well
 
03:34:10.469 --> 03:34:10.479 align:start position:0%
representative Marquel in the
 
03:34:13.910 --> 03:34:13.920 align:start position:0%
capacity of being one of the amendment
 
03:34:16.590 --> 03:34:16.600 align:start position:0%
writers and briefly
 
03:34:18.910 --> 03:34:18.920 align:start position:0%
okay well I don't know that this
 
03:34:21.510 --> 03:34:21.520 align:start position:0%
necessarily addresses all situations
 
03:34:23.870 --> 03:34:23.880 align:start position:0%
under the law okay there's going to have
 
03:34:27.229 --> 03:34:27.239 align:start position:0%
to be some flex and some exercise uh of
 
03:34:30.269 --> 03:34:30.279 align:start position:0%
discretion okay I can't speak to the to
 
03:34:31.990 --> 03:34:32.000 align:start position:0%
that aspect as to whether or not they
 
03:34:34.229 --> 03:34:34.239 align:start position:0%
would subject to criminal penalties
 
03:34:36.150 --> 03:34:36.160 align:start position:0%
there may be there there may be other
 
03:34:40.269 --> 03:34:40.279 align:start position:0%
sanctions that could be taking place uh
 
03:34:44.229 --> 03:34:44.239 align:start position:0%
that arise within the context of
 
03:34:49.070 --> 03:34:49.080 align:start position:0%
um of being a practitioner however um
 
03:34:51.309 --> 03:34:51.319 align:start position:0%
the converse is almost true when you
 
03:34:53.910 --> 03:34:53.920 align:start position:0%
would say do you think a parent ought to
 
03:34:57.269 --> 03:34:57.279 align:start position:0%
know absent any allegations of abuse or
 
03:34:59.110 --> 03:34:59.120 align:start position:0%
neglect that their their child is being
 
03:35:01.110 --> 03:35:01.120 align:start position:0%
prescribed birth control pills that's
 
03:35:02.630 --> 03:35:02.640 align:start position:0%
another question I think somebody else
 
03:35:04.830 --> 03:35:04.840 align:start position:0%
is going to have to answer well I mean
 
03:35:06.269 --> 03:35:06.279 align:start position:0%
followup I would suggest that the
 
03:35:07.710 --> 03:35:07.720 align:start position:0%
federal government has already weighed
 
03:35:09.670 --> 03:35:09.680 align:start position:0%
in on that and there are a number of
 
03:35:12.189 --> 03:35:12.199 align:start position:0%
statutes that say no parents don't have
 
03:35:13.950 --> 03:35:13.960 align:start position:0%
the right to that under federal
 
03:35:16.469 --> 03:35:16.479 align:start position:0%
guidelines okay well the when you look
 
03:35:17.950 --> 03:35:17.960 align:start position:0%
at the
 
03:35:22.710 --> 03:35:22.720 align:start position:0%
cfrs okay um there are issues of abuse
 
03:35:24.309 --> 03:35:24.319 align:start position:0%
there are issues of whether or not that
 
03:35:27.189 --> 03:35:27.199 align:start position:0%
becomes private okay or not and that's
 
03:35:28.429 --> 03:35:28.439 align:start position:0%
going to I think going to have to be a
 
03:35:29.830 --> 03:35:29.840 align:start position:0%
judgment call and I think it's going to
 
03:35:32.309 --> 03:35:32.319 align:start position:0%
need some further some further action
 
03:35:34.429 --> 03:35:34.439 align:start position:0%
like I said nothing in this statute is
 
03:35:36.469 --> 03:35:36.479 align:start position:0%
going to be absolute under all
 
03:35:38.510 --> 03:35:38.520 align:start position:0%
circumstances and if there's a need to
 
03:35:41.189 --> 03:35:41.199 align:start position:0%
be able to protect a child from abuse or
 
03:35:43.229 --> 03:35:43.239 align:start position:0%
neglect that's a different matter
 
03:35:45.189 --> 03:35:45.199 align:start position:0%
altogether thank you thank you for your
 
03:35:45.199 --> 03:35:47.349 align:start position:0%
altogether thank you thank you for your
indulg

03:35:47.349 --> 03:35:47.359 align:start position:0%
indulg
 
03:35:50.510 --> 03:35:50.520 align:start position:0%
any other questions of uh the speaker
 
03:35:58.269 --> 03:35:58.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:02.110 --> 03:36:02.120 align:start position:0%
speaker thank you Mr chair thank thank
 
03:36:04.750 --> 03:36:04.760 align:start position:0%
you Mr Speaker and representative deont
 
03:36:07.150 --> 03:36:07.160 align:start position:0%
um in in I want to go back to
 
03:36:09.750 --> 03:36:09.760 align:start position:0%
representative Greg's question on page
 
03:36:15.910 --> 03:36:15.920 align:start position:0%
for the language uh starting uh with uh
 
03:36:19.630 --> 03:36:19.640 align:start position:0%
uh line nine through
 
03:36:23.110 --> 03:36:23.120 align:start position:0%
um um line
 
03:36:25.870 --> 03:36:25.880 align:start position:0%
23 all of those use the
 
03:36:28.670 --> 03:36:28.680 align:start position:0%
language the right of a parent and I
 
03:36:32.429 --> 03:36:32.439 align:start position:0%
believe a representative Greg's concern
 
03:36:34.790 --> 03:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
was I'm a
 
03:36:38.269 --> 03:36:38.279 align:start position:0%
parent of I'm a let's assume I'm a
 
03:36:41.150 --> 03:36:41.160 align:start position:0%
parent of a minor thank God no longer uh
 
03:36:45.269 --> 03:36:45.279 align:start position:0%
but um uh and I go up to uh Coos County
 
03:36:47.630 --> 03:36:47.640 align:start position:0%
to just look at their records not
 
03:36:49.510 --> 03:36:49.520 align:start position:0%
because I'm thinking of moving up there
 
03:36:53.110 --> 03:36:53.120 align:start position:0%
uh but because um I just as a political
 
03:36:54.710 --> 03:36:54.720 align:start position:0%
matter I want to find out what's going
 
03:36:57.790 --> 03:36:57.800 align:start position:0%
on up there I I appreciate that concern
 
03:37:00.910 --> 03:37:00.920 align:start position:0%
and I'm wondering if for example uh on
 
03:37:04.590 --> 03:37:04.600 align:start position:0%
line 11 on page four the right of a
 
03:37:06.910 --> 03:37:06.920 align:start position:0%
parent to receive Statewide standardized
 
03:37:09.670 --> 03:37:09.680 align:start position:0%
assessment results if we were to add to
 
03:37:12.790 --> 03:37:12.800 align:start position:0%
that sentence relating to their child
 
03:37:15.950 --> 03:37:15.960 align:start position:0%
would that be an acceptable limitation
 
03:37:17.710 --> 03:37:17.720 align:start position:0%
on what you
 
03:37:22.349 --> 03:37:22.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:26.710 --> 03:37:26.720 align:start position:0%
doing I I uh representative
 
03:37:29.870 --> 03:37:29.880 align:start position:0%
um I think that this is the second
 
03:37:32.950 --> 03:37:32.960 align:start position:0%
rewrite of the amendment and if any
 
03:37:34.630 --> 03:37:34.640 align:start position:0%
member has an amendment they want to
 
03:37:37.229 --> 03:37:37.239 align:start position:0%
bring forward that is something that is
 
03:37:39.830 --> 03:37:39.840 align:start position:0%
your right to do that so if you had if
 
03:37:41.429 --> 03:37:41.439 align:start position:0%
you had an amendment that you wanted to
 
03:37:43.830 --> 03:37:43.840 align:start position:0%
bring forward you can bring It Forward
 
03:37:46.269 --> 03:37:46.279 align:start position:0%
uh you know during executive session
 
03:37:50.229 --> 03:37:50.239 align:start position:0%
followup um the scheduled and announced
 
03:37:53.590 --> 03:37:53.600 align:start position:0%
exact date for this is March 4th so
 
03:37:55.830 --> 03:37:55.840 align:start position:0%
therefore we have two weeks if anyone
 
03:37:59.349 --> 03:37:59.359 align:start position:0%
should choose to do this followup um and
 
03:38:02.710 --> 03:38:02.720 align:start position:0%
and I appreciate that uh Mr Speaker um I
 
03:38:05.710 --> 03:38:05.720 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious whether either you or
 
03:38:09.110 --> 03:38:09.120 align:start position:0%
representative D Simone um what you
 
03:38:12.630 --> 03:38:12.640 align:start position:0%
think about that kind of modifying
 
03:38:16.070 --> 03:38:16.080 align:start position:0%
language I'm always open to certain
 
03:38:17.750 --> 03:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
languages but I never make a commitment
 
03:38:19.389 --> 03:38:19.399 align:start position:0%
till I actually see
 
03:38:24.429 --> 03:38:24.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:26.710 --> 03:38:26.720 align:start position:0%
bad representative
 
03:38:29.349 --> 03:38:29.359 align:start position:0%
sidel thank you Mr chairman this is
 
03:38:33.309 --> 03:38:33.319 align:start position:0%
actually um to address representative
 
03:38:36.590 --> 03:38:36.600 align:start position:0%
Sher on page one line 14 it gives you
 
03:38:38.030 --> 03:38:38.040 align:start position:0%
the definition of a parent it means a
 
03:38:40.189 --> 03:38:40.199 align:start position:0%
person who is the legal natural or
 
03:38:42.349 --> 03:38:42.359 align:start position:0%
adoptive parent of a minor child so
 
03:38:46.110 --> 03:38:46.120 align:start position:0%
would that not cover your quest uh
 
03:38:48.910 --> 03:38:48.920 align:start position:0%
follow up to follow up to her yes um the
 
03:38:53.590 --> 03:38:53.600 align:start position:0%
way I read that is as long as I have I
 
03:38:57.229 --> 03:38:57.239 align:start position:0%
am the legal natural parent of a minor I
 
03:38:59.630 --> 03:38:59.640 align:start position:0%
can go to any school district in the
 
03:39:01.950 --> 03:39:01.960 align:start position:0%
state whether I'm thinking of my child's
 
03:39:03.550 --> 03:39:03.560 align:start position:0%
in that school district or not whether
 
03:39:06.550 --> 03:39:06.560 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking of trans uh transferring uh
 
03:39:09.510 --> 03:39:09.520 align:start position:0%
to that district and I can look at their
 
03:39:12.429 --> 03:39:12.439 align:start position:0%
records to be a little too cute about it
 
03:39:14.229 --> 03:39:14.239 align:start position:0%
just for the hell of it that that's my
 
03:39:17.429 --> 03:39:17.439 align:start position:0%
concern I I I don't want just to open
 
03:39:21.349 --> 03:39:21.359 align:start position:0%
the door to you know school districts
 
03:39:23.189 --> 03:39:23.199 align:start position:0%
all over the
 
03:39:27.389 --> 03:39:27.399 align:start position:0%
state being interrog getting records
 
03:39:30.110 --> 03:39:30.120 align:start position:0%
requests for records that don't relate
 
03:39:32.389 --> 03:39:32.399 align:start position:0%
to their child in that District that
 
03:39:36.550 --> 03:39:36.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:38.910 --> 03:39:38.920 align:start position:0%
and if I could ask the speaker and the
 
03:39:44.309 --> 03:39:44.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:46.910 --> 03:39:46.920 align:start position:0%
that if I I could ask the speaker and
 
03:39:48.870 --> 03:39:48.880 align:start position:0%
the vice chairman if this would
 
03:39:52.030 --> 03:39:52.040 align:start position:0%
materially affect the
 
03:39:55.550 --> 03:39:55.560 align:start position:0%
bill um may I ask you what would
 
03:39:57.830 --> 03:39:57.840 align:start position:0%
materially affect the bill the
 
03:40:02.309 --> 03:40:02.319 align:start position:0%
definition of a parent Visa v a
 
03:40:07.830 --> 03:40:07.840 align:start position:0%
school is cleared to say a parent of a
 
03:40:10.150 --> 03:40:10.160 align:start position:0%
child in that school what representative
 
03:40:13.269 --> 03:40:13.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:17.670 --> 03:40:17.680 align:start position:0%
asking well Mr chair to the point of um
 
03:40:22.269 --> 03:40:22.279 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I apologize to the point of
 
03:40:25.950 --> 03:40:25.960 align:start position:0%
um another representative's statement
 
03:40:28.590 --> 03:40:28.600 align:start position:0%
the definition clearly states
 
03:40:35.030 --> 03:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
parent means a person who is the
 
03:40:38.870 --> 03:40:38.880 align:start position:0%
legal natural or adoptive parent of a
 
03:40:42.990 --> 03:40:43.000 align:start position:0%
minor and I think that that uh clarifies
 
03:40:45.670 --> 03:40:45.680 align:start position:0%
as far as I'm concerned again I will
 
03:40:48.030 --> 03:40:48.040 align:start position:0%
reiterate uh Mr
 
03:40:50.630 --> 03:40:50.640 align:start position:0%
speaker's statement of if anybody else
 
03:40:52.510 --> 03:40:52.520 align:start position:0%
feels that it could be made clearer and
 
03:40:54.429 --> 03:40:54.439 align:start position:0%
you want to bring another
 
03:40:56.990 --> 03:40:57.000 align:start position:0%
amendment and that's your your uh
 
03:40:59.429 --> 03:40:59.439 align:start position:0%
legislative right to do
 
03:41:03.870 --> 03:41:03.880 align:start position:0%
so representative Greg just if if this
 
03:41:06.269 --> 03:41:06.279 align:start position:0%
welcome oh thank you Mr chairman sorry I
 
03:41:08.590 --> 03:41:08.600 align:start position:0%
already think you once this time no
 
03:41:11.189 --> 03:41:11.199 align:start position:0%
would you like an all day thank you pass
 
03:41:12.670 --> 03:41:12.680 align:start position:0%
can we just do a blanket it would be
 
03:41:15.830 --> 03:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
nice okay you have one um I apologize
 
03:41:17.870 --> 03:41:17.880 align:start position:0%
um thank you for taking another question
 
03:41:20.269 --> 03:41:20.279 align:start position:0%
for me I just
 
03:41:22.830 --> 03:41:22.840 align:start position:0%
am wanting to make sure because we do
 
03:41:24.830 --> 03:41:24.840 align:start position:0%
know that gers and the law can get weird
 
03:41:26.429 --> 03:41:26.439 align:start position:0%
and stuff do you think
 
03:41:29.910 --> 03:41:29.920 align:start position:0%
that if a parent could go do this from
 
03:41:32.510 --> 03:41:32.520 align:start position:0%
any school and this this is going to by
 
03:41:35.189 --> 03:41:35.199 align:start position:0%
your um definition and stuff include
 
03:41:40.429 --> 03:41:40.439 align:start position:0%
homeschools include um uh private
 
03:41:42.189 --> 03:41:42.199 align:start position:0%
schools everything else so this could
 
03:41:44.389 --> 03:41:44.399 align:start position:0%
financially be a heavy burden if all of
 
03:41:46.870 --> 03:41:46.880 align:start position:0%
a sudden any parent can go to any of
 
03:41:48.510 --> 03:41:48.520 align:start position:0%
these schools and start requesting thing
 
03:41:49.910 --> 03:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
I I certainly am worried about the
 
03:41:52.590 --> 03:41:52.600 align:start position:0%
weaponization of that we've had and
 
03:41:54.030 --> 03:41:54.040 align:start position:0%
that's you know we've had right to know
 
03:41:56.510 --> 03:41:56.520 align:start position:0%
stuff and and um it can get very very
 
03:41:58.510 --> 03:41:58.520 align:start position:0%
costly with any of the schools
 
03:41:59.630 --> 03:41:59.640 align:start position:0%
specifically we're talking about like
 
03:42:01.469 --> 03:42:01.479 align:start position:0%
home schools and stuff like that if a
 
03:42:03.830 --> 03:42:03.840 align:start position:0%
parent was could do that do you see
 
03:42:05.510 --> 03:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
where that could be a problem yeah I I I
 
03:42:07.429 --> 03:42:07.439 align:start position:0%
think this um you know the the
 
03:42:09.990 --> 03:42:10.000 align:start position:0%
discussion of a parent going to a school
 
03:42:11.710 --> 03:42:11.720 align:start position:0%
200 miles away
 
03:42:15.630 --> 03:42:15.640 align:start position:0%
is um not realistic
 
03:42:18.710 --> 03:42:18.720 align:start position:0%
now I mean let's let's be realistic why
 
03:42:21.830 --> 03:42:21.840 align:start position:0%
would a parent that's in Salem Drive to
 
03:42:25.189 --> 03:42:25.199 align:start position:0%
Berlin and ask for what Berlin was doing
 
03:42:28.110 --> 03:42:28.120 align:start position:0%
if they never plan on being there I mean
 
03:42:32.590 --> 03:42:32.600 align:start position:0%
you you can um you can
 
03:42:36.110 --> 03:42:36.120 align:start position:0%
possibly imagine maybe somebody might do
 
03:42:39.189 --> 03:42:39.199 align:start position:0%
that but I think realistically uh that's
 
03:42:41.830 --> 03:42:41.840 align:start position:0%
not going to happen May I make a request
 
03:42:43.710 --> 03:42:43.720 align:start position:0%
that we move off this subject because I
 
03:42:46.189 --> 03:42:46.199 align:start position:0%
think the answer is if somebody here is
 
03:42:48.630 --> 03:42:48.640 align:start position:0%
really uh concerned about that you have
 
03:42:50.429 --> 03:42:50.439 align:start position:0%
two weeks to get an amendment to clarify
 
03:42:52.790 --> 03:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
the language you to protect the fears
 
03:42:56.469 --> 03:42:56.479 align:start position:0%
you have could we do that okay other
 
03:42:59.870 --> 03:42:59.880 align:start position:0%
questions other questions seeing none
 
03:43:02.349 --> 03:43:02.359 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chairman and
 
03:43:06.309 --> 03:43:06.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:08.429 --> 03:43:08.439 align:start position:0%
committee thank you Mr chairman and
 
03:43:15.590 --> 03:43:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:18.469 --> 03:43:18.479 align:start position:0%
it is a custom in the house that if
 
03:43:21.670 --> 03:43:21.680 align:start position:0%
Representatives wish to speak they are
 
03:43:26.830 --> 03:43:26.840 align:start position:0%
accorded um primary consideration and
 
03:43:28.389 --> 03:43:28.399 align:start position:0%
with that the chair recognizes
 
03:43:47.229 --> 03:43:47.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:48.389 --> 03:43:48.399 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I'm president
 
03:43:49.950 --> 03:43:49.960 align:start position:0%
Timothy Horgan from straford County
 
03:43:52.910 --> 03:43:52.920 align:start position:0%
District 10 the town of Durham and uh
 
03:43:54.710 --> 03:43:54.720 align:start position:0%
sort of a scary thing being the first
 
03:43:57.389 --> 03:43:57.399 align:start position:0%
one of many to speak against this bill
 
03:44:01.510 --> 03:44:01.520 align:start position:0%
um you've you've uh responded Mr chair
 
03:44:03.070 --> 03:44:03.080 align:start position:0%
you responded to objections from various
 
03:44:04.590 --> 03:44:04.600 align:start position:0%
committee members by inviting him to
 
03:44:07.670 --> 03:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
submit an amendment I personally feel
 
03:44:09.309 --> 03:44:09.319 align:start position:0%
just looking at the original bill and
 
03:44:10.670 --> 03:44:10.680 align:start position:0%
the amendment the amendment was just
 
03:44:13.670 --> 03:44:13.680 align:start position:0%
published today apparently so it's not
 
03:44:16.990 --> 03:44:17.000 align:start position:0%
even on the General Court website so um
 
03:44:18.469 --> 03:44:18.479 align:start position:0%
we haven't had that much time to digest
 
03:44:20.229 --> 03:44:20.239 align:start position:0%
it I think the whole bill is so flawed
 
03:44:23.149 --> 03:44:23.159 align:start position:0%
that I doubt that I can vote for even a
 
03:44:25.389 --> 03:44:25.399 align:start position:0%
heavily amended
 
03:44:28.269 --> 03:44:28.279 align:start position:0%
version um first of all I think it's
 
03:44:31.110 --> 03:44:31.120 align:start position:0%
basically unnecessary parents
 
03:44:34.670 --> 03:44:34.680 align:start position:0%
already have these rights and if we are
 
03:44:37.550 --> 03:44:37.560 align:start position:0%
um trying to enumerate these rights in
 
03:44:39.790 --> 03:44:39.800 align:start position:0%
RS say probably be more appropriate to
 
03:44:42.469 --> 03:44:42.479 align:start position:0%
try to craft a children's Bill of Rights
 
03:44:42.479 --> 03:44:43.750 align:start position:0%
try to craft a children's Bill of Rights
obviously

03:44:43.750 --> 03:44:43.760 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
03:44:46.269 --> 03:44:46.279 align:start position:0%
children um children are dependent on
 
03:44:47.910 --> 03:44:47.920 align:start position:0%
their parents so you can't separate
 
03:44:49.790 --> 03:44:49.800 align:start position:0%
one's interests from the others but I
 
03:44:51.950 --> 03:44:51.960 align:start position:0%
think the children's uh rights should
 
03:44:56.110 --> 03:44:56.120 align:start position:0%
come first Chris timing just the phrase
 
03:44:57.750 --> 03:44:57.760 align:start position:0%
Bill of Rights that's something you know
 
03:44:59.750 --> 03:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
we're all in theory in favor of um
 
03:45:02.149 --> 03:45:02.159 align:start position:0%
although there is a lot of I probably
 
03:45:03.229 --> 03:45:03.239 align:start position:0%
don't want to get into too much but
 
03:45:04.950 --> 03:45:04.960 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of uncertainty of what's
 
03:45:06.710 --> 03:45:06.720 align:start position:0%
going in Washington DC about exactly
 
03:45:08.389 --> 03:45:08.399 align:start position:0%
what rights we have which parts of the
 
03:45:10.149 --> 03:45:10.159 align:start position:0%
Constitution actually apply and that's
 
03:45:12.149 --> 03:45:12.159 align:start position:0%
obviously take his name from The Bill of
 
03:45:15.469 --> 03:45:15.479 align:start position:0%
Rights US Constitution but that's uh
 
03:45:18.110 --> 03:45:18.120 align:start position:0%
that's that's uh that's probably like
 
03:45:19.389 --> 03:45:19.399 align:start position:0%
not really our concern we're in
 
03:45:22.590 --> 03:45:22.600 align:start position:0%
conquered not Washington DC um terms of
 
03:45:25.149 --> 03:45:25.159 align:start position:0%
the so in terms of the emphasis of it I
 
03:45:28.149 --> 03:45:28.159 align:start position:0%
circled uh a few things one is there's
 
03:45:29.750 --> 03:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
this uh you still have this thing in
 
03:45:32.110 --> 03:45:32.120 align:start position:0%
here and why I give you I give the
 
03:45:34.070 --> 03:45:34.080 align:start position:0%
sponsor Amendment the props for making
 
03:45:36.469 --> 03:45:36.479 align:start position:0%
the bill shorter so that's they've taken
 
03:45:38.030 --> 03:45:38.040 align:start position:0%
about a page out of it so that's
 
03:45:39.910 --> 03:45:39.920 align:start position:0%
probably a good thing like this's whole
 
03:45:44.030 --> 03:45:44.040 align:start position:0%
thing about um before any blood or DNA
 
03:45:46.229 --> 03:45:46.239 align:start position:0%
is created stor close I don't really
 
03:45:49.309 --> 03:45:49.319 align:start position:0%
know what the purpose of that is and
 
03:45:52.990 --> 03:45:53.000 align:start position:0%
then also brings me uh and terms of what
 
03:45:55.189 --> 03:45:55.199 align:start position:0%
they would be helpful representative in
 
03:45:56.630 --> 03:45:56.640 align:start position:0%
when calling it out if you could give us
 
03:45:59.070 --> 03:45:59.080 align:start position:0%
a page and a line absolutely page page
 
03:46:02.469 --> 03:46:02.479 align:start position:0%
two lines 25 25 and 26 and that's
 
03:46:03.550 --> 03:46:03.560 align:start position:0%
something it's carried over from the
 
03:46:06.510 --> 03:46:06.520 align:start position:0%
original Bill what exactly uh that's
 
03:46:09.429 --> 03:46:09.439 align:start position:0%
about I don't know and that um actually
 
03:46:11.630 --> 03:46:11.640 align:start position:0%
brings me to one of the issues that one
 
03:46:13.389 --> 03:46:13.399 align:start position:0%
of the things that's not address in this
 
03:46:15.550 --> 03:46:15.560 align:start position:0%
bill is the right of a
 
03:46:18.510 --> 03:46:18.520 align:start position:0%
trans students to you know participate
 
03:46:20.309 --> 03:46:20.319 align:start position:0%
in school activities and to be allowed
 
03:46:22.229 --> 03:46:22.239 align:start position:0%
to go to school in peace which um has
 
03:46:25.990 --> 03:46:26.000 align:start position:0%
been um which has been just abrogated by
 
03:46:29.189 --> 03:46:29.199 align:start position:0%
various actions taken um also there's uh
 
03:46:30.550 --> 03:46:30.560 align:start position:0%
another admission there there's nothing
 
03:46:32.590 --> 03:46:32.600 align:start position:0%
about children who are and parents who
 
03:46:34.030 --> 03:46:34.040 align:start position:0%
are different in other ways so there's
 
03:46:37.189 --> 03:46:37.199 align:start position:0%
nothing there to protect um LGBT
 
03:46:39.750 --> 03:46:39.760 align:start position:0%
children you know lesbian or gay
 
03:46:42.349 --> 03:46:42.359 align:start position:0%
children lesbian or gay parents uh also
 
03:46:44.110 --> 03:46:44.120 align:start position:0%
even people merely of a different uh
 
03:46:45.670 --> 03:46:45.680 align:start position:0%
racial category or different in some
 
03:46:47.630 --> 03:46:47.640 align:start position:0%
other ways there's no protections at all
 
03:46:49.870 --> 03:46:49.880 align:start position:0%
for the rights of those parents or those
 
03:46:54.149 --> 03:46:54.159 align:start position:0%
families enumerated in this bill um they
 
03:46:58.110 --> 03:46:58.120 align:start position:0%
do talk about uh sex education although
 
03:47:00.630 --> 03:47:00.640 align:start position:0%
children you know children are are going
 
03:47:03.229 --> 03:47:03.239 align:start position:0%
to learn about uh sex regardless of
 
03:47:05.389 --> 03:47:05.399 align:start position:0%
whether or not you take them out of sex
 
03:47:07.429 --> 03:47:07.439 align:start position:0%
education there's
 
03:47:10.950 --> 03:47:10.960 align:start position:0%
some and uh there's also uh language
 
03:47:12.469 --> 03:47:12.479 align:start position:0%
there about immunizations you have the
 
03:47:14.510 --> 03:47:14.520 align:start position:0%
right you have the right to opt out of
 
03:47:16.309 --> 03:47:16.319 align:start position:0%
imun ations which I guess you already
 
03:47:17.550 --> 03:47:17.560 align:start position:0%
have but there's nothing in there about
 
03:47:19.309 --> 03:47:19.319 align:start position:0%
the right of
 
03:47:22.269 --> 03:47:22.279 align:start position:0%
uh parents who support immunizations to
 
03:47:25.269 --> 03:47:25.279 align:start position:0%
not have their children exposed to um
 
03:47:28.229 --> 03:47:28.239 align:start position:0%
unvaccinated uh unvaccinated children in
 
03:47:29.950 --> 03:47:29.960 align:start position:0%
the in the classroom where nothing there
 
03:47:34.030 --> 03:47:34.040 align:start position:0%
to tell them how to protect um children
 
03:47:36.710 --> 03:47:36.720 align:start position:0%
from from uh from transmissible diseases
 
03:47:39.510 --> 03:47:39.520 align:start position:0%
in fact there's um other Al those on the
 
03:47:41.269 --> 03:47:41.279 align:start position:0%
other hand it doesn't address the issue
 
03:47:43.269 --> 03:47:43.279 align:start position:0%
of mask policies either but that's or
 
03:47:45.870 --> 03:47:45.880 align:start position:0%
other missions I just think this bill
 
03:47:48.189 --> 03:47:48.199 align:start position:0%
is unnecessary I certainly uh look
 
03:47:50.030 --> 03:47:50.040 align:start position:0%
forward to see when we have the first
 
03:47:52.030 --> 03:47:52.040 align:start position:0%
when we have the house session day after
 
03:47:53.630 --> 03:47:53.640 align:start position:0%
your May 4th executive session what
 
03:47:55.550 --> 03:47:55.560 align:start position:0%
comes out of it but I see very little or
 
03:47:59.189 --> 03:47:59.199 align:start position:0%
no chance that um a bipartisan
 
03:48:00.950 --> 03:48:00.960 align:start position:0%
compromise can be reached that I
 
03:48:03.510 --> 03:48:03.520 align:start position:0%
personally can support so just I think
 
03:48:06.110 --> 03:48:06.120 align:start position:0%
the whole um I just think the whole aim
 
03:48:07.910 --> 03:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
of the bill it's I mean it's
 
03:48:09.349 --> 03:48:09.359 align:start position:0%
well-intentioned but I just just think
 
03:48:11.149 --> 03:48:11.159 align:start position:0%
the whole aim of the bill is like not
 
03:48:13.030 --> 03:48:13.040 align:start position:0%
head in direction that can get uh you
 
03:48:14.389 --> 03:48:14.399 align:start position:0%
know the type of consensus that we
 
03:48:16.269 --> 03:48:16.279 align:start position:0%
should have before passing a bill like
 
03:48:19.469 --> 03:48:19.479 align:start position:0%
this so I'm um I'm inclined to say uh
 
03:48:20.870 --> 03:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
I'm inclined to say just find this
 
03:48:22.830 --> 03:48:22.840 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate and you know
 
03:48:24.670 --> 03:48:24.680 align:start position:0%
move on and mean I'm sure this bill will
 
03:48:26.229 --> 03:48:26.239 align:start position:0%
come back in another form in a future
 
03:48:29.389 --> 03:48:29.399 align:start position:0%
session but um I will you take questions
 
03:48:30.950 --> 03:48:30.960 align:start position:0%
ask three minutes and you're well over
 
03:48:33.149 --> 03:48:33.159 align:start position:0%
it uh any questions representative
 
03:48:35.229 --> 03:48:35.239 align:start position:0%
Raymond thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
03:48:37.269 --> 03:48:37.279 align:start position:0%
you representative Morgan um I just have
 
03:48:38.590 --> 03:48:38.600 align:start position:0%
one question would it surprise you to
 
03:48:41.630 --> 03:48:41.640 align:start position:0%
know that almost everything in this Bell
 
03:48:43.429 --> 03:48:43.439 align:start position:0%
with the exception of the medical
 
03:48:46.189 --> 03:48:46.199 align:start position:0%
records um is already in state law and
 
03:48:47.830 --> 03:48:47.840 align:start position:0%
there's a technical advisory on the
 
03:48:50.750 --> 03:48:50.760 align:start position:0%
department of Ed's website yeah um from
 
03:48:54.349 --> 03:48:54.359 align:start position:0%
August of 2022 that lists literally
 
03:48:56.950 --> 03:48:56.960 align:start position:0%
almost everything including the RSA
 
03:48:59.510 --> 03:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
there that it came from oh not at all no
 
03:49:02.790 --> 03:49:02.800 align:start position:0%
so that's which uh I'll also mention
 
03:49:06.070 --> 03:49:06.080 align:start position:0%
this bill is in not really the chapter
 
03:49:07.910 --> 03:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
of the RSA so I expect to see it I guess
 
03:49:11.229 --> 03:49:11.239 align:start position:0%
it's one about uh you know child it's
 
03:49:13.950 --> 03:49:13.960 align:start position:0%
one about uh child safety law but it's
 
03:49:16.510 --> 03:49:16.520 align:start position:0%
not in the I say about uh schools which
 
03:49:18.550 --> 03:49:18.560 align:start position:0%
is also another flaw with it that it
 
03:49:20.750 --> 03:49:20.760 align:start position:0%
mostly only applies you can only enforce
 
03:49:22.670 --> 03:49:22.680 align:start position:0%
these laws if the school with if the
 
03:49:24.189 --> 03:49:24.199 align:start position:0%
school is part of a school district so
 
03:49:26.550 --> 03:49:26.560 align:start position:0%
that leaves out uh well private schools
 
03:49:29.429 --> 03:49:29.439 align:start position:0%
obviously also Charter Public Schools
 
03:49:32.389 --> 03:49:32.399 align:start position:0%
public acmy and also uh the various
 
03:49:34.429 --> 03:49:34.439 align:start position:0%
institutions that have subsidized by the
 
03:49:36.830 --> 03:49:36.840 align:start position:0%
EFA vure program so yes but I would
 
03:49:39.830 --> 03:49:39.840 align:start position:0%
certainly believe I I I hadn't thought
 
03:49:42.149 --> 03:49:42.159 align:start position:0%
of that uh advisory I think I did see it
 
03:49:43.990 --> 03:49:44.000 align:start position:0%
three years ago but yes I would believe
 
03:49:45.550 --> 03:49:45.560 align:start position:0%
all of that of course i' had a bunch of
 
03:49:47.149 --> 03:49:47.159 align:start position:0%
other things I would also believe so
 
03:49:49.309 --> 03:49:49.319 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for the question
 
03:49:49.319 --> 03:49:50.670 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for the question
representative

03:49:50.670 --> 03:49:50.680 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:49:52.950 --> 03:49:52.960 align:start position:0%
love thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
03:49:56.030 --> 03:49:56.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question um as I read the the
 
03:49:57.750 --> 03:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire state constitution and the
 
03:50:00.870 --> 03:50:00.880 align:start position:0%
US Constitution uh I haven't seen any
 
03:50:03.149 --> 03:50:03.159 align:start position:0%
any Couts or anything that says except
 
03:50:03.159 --> 03:50:04.550 align:start position:0%
any Couts or anything that says except
for

03:50:04.550 --> 03:50:04.560 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:50:08.710 --> 03:50:08.720 align:start position:0%
LBGTQ uh we all have the same rights uh
 
03:50:10.630 --> 03:50:10.640 align:start position:0%
am I missing
 
03:50:15.710 --> 03:50:15.720 align:start position:0%
something um I don't know but I mean the
 
03:50:18.149 --> 03:50:18.159 align:start position:0%
uh was the state in the and well the US
 
03:50:20.070 --> 03:50:20.080 align:start position:0%
Constitution although I'm you know kind
 
03:50:21.950 --> 03:50:21.960 align:start position:0%
of I'm having about my doubts about what
 
03:50:23.670 --> 03:50:23.680 align:start position:0%
the US Constitution which parts of it
 
03:50:25.269 --> 03:50:25.279 align:start position:0%
are actually being enforced or which
 
03:50:27.870 --> 03:50:27.880 align:start position:0%
ones have been overturned by executive
 
03:50:29.590 --> 03:50:29.600 align:start position:0%
order I shouldn't have said that but
 
03:50:31.269 --> 03:50:31.279 align:start position:0%
anyway yes but I think respect for all
 
03:50:33.550 --> 03:50:33.560 align:start position:0%
people is something that's uh that's
 
03:50:36.429 --> 03:50:36.439 align:start position:0%
always been a principle both the US and
 
03:50:38.710 --> 03:50:38.720 align:start position:0%
state constitutions and of course
 
03:50:40.670 --> 03:50:40.680 align:start position:0%
bringing the LGBT community that's a
 
03:50:42.389 --> 03:50:42.399 align:start position:0%
relatively recent development but it's
 
03:50:44.389 --> 03:50:44.399 align:start position:0%
it's in line with uh it's in line with
 
03:50:44.399 --> 03:50:45.550 align:start position:0%
it's in line with uh it's in line with
how

03:50:45.550 --> 03:50:45.560 align:start position:0%
how
 
03:50:49.630 --> 03:50:49.640 align:start position:0%
how our view how how how the American uh
 
03:50:51.670 --> 03:50:51.680 align:start position:0%
how we view the rights of of people here
 
03:50:53.349 --> 03:50:53.359 align:start position:0%
in the United States of America over the
 
03:50:55.030 --> 03:50:55.040 align:start position:0%
centuries so and there's always been
 
03:50:57.670 --> 03:50:57.680 align:start position:0%
lgbtq people in the United States anyway
 
03:51:01.189 --> 03:51:01.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:03.630 --> 03:51:03.640 align:start position:0%
thanks okay thank you for your
 
03:51:06.510 --> 03:51:06.520 align:start position:0%
testimony and I'm going to address the
 
03:51:11.030 --> 03:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
audience um we have a stack of cards
 
03:51:13.870 --> 03:51:13.880 align:start position:0%
most of you have appropriately put down
 
03:51:16.429 --> 03:51:16.439 align:start position:0%
time to space speak 3
 
03:51:19.030 --> 03:51:19.040 align:start position:0%
minutes um I can't speak for others but
 
03:51:20.830 --> 03:51:20.840 align:start position:0%
I'm of an age where after 3 minutes I
 
03:51:22.710 --> 03:51:22.720 align:start position:0%
start nodding off so the first three
 
03:51:25.950 --> 03:51:25.960 align:start position:0%
minutes are very important after that
 
03:51:28.149 --> 03:51:28.159 align:start position:0%
but also numbers of you have taken time
 
03:51:32.590 --> 03:51:32.600 align:start position:0%
off from work or whatever to be here and
 
03:51:34.550 --> 03:51:34.560 align:start position:0%
if somebody goes way over 3 minutes and
 
03:51:36.910 --> 03:51:36.920 align:start position:0%
then somebody else and then somebody
 
03:51:40.790 --> 03:51:40.800 align:start position:0%
else it may be 5:00 when we close and
 
03:51:42.189 --> 03:51:42.199 align:start position:0%
you haven't been heard and you've wasted
 
03:51:44.710 --> 03:51:44.720 align:start position:0%
a time a day off from work so I'm going
 
03:51:47.630 --> 03:51:47.640 align:start position:0%
to hold you to the three minute Rule and
 
03:51:49.429 --> 03:51:49.439 align:start position:0%
at one minute I'm going to go something
 
03:51:52.750 --> 03:51:52.760 align:start position:0%
like this and at two something like this
 
03:51:55.309 --> 03:51:55.319 align:start position:0%
and um when we get to about 250 I'm
 
03:51:57.269 --> 03:51:57.279 align:start position:0%
going to say wrap it up please and I'll
 
03:51:59.670 --> 03:51:59.680 align:start position:0%
give you a little time to finish your
 
03:52:02.269 --> 03:52:02.279 align:start position:0%
sentence and so on but I'm going to hold
 
03:52:06.710 --> 03:52:06.720 align:start position:0%
everybody to that roughly three minute
 
03:52:09.349 --> 03:52:09.359 align:start position:0%
rule with that the chair Rec uh
 
03:52:11.710 --> 03:52:11.720 align:start position:0%
recognizes uh Mr David Trumble from
 
03:52:11.720 --> 03:52:15.429 align:start position:0%
recognizes uh Mr David Trumble from
where

03:52:15.429 --> 03:52:15.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:23.070 --> 03:52:23.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:25.670 --> 03:52:25.680 align:start position:0%
you and the hardest thing to testify
 
03:52:28.110 --> 03:52:28.120 align:start position:0%
here is you have mastered it turn the
 
03:52:30.429 --> 03:52:30.439 align:start position:0%
light on turn the mic on thank you got
 
03:52:32.750 --> 03:52:32.760 align:start position:0%
it thank you Mr chairman and committee
 
03:52:34.830 --> 03:52:34.840 align:start position:0%
members David Trumble from where I oppos
 
03:52:36.950 --> 03:52:36.960 align:start position:0%
this bill for two reasons I agree with
 
03:52:38.910 --> 03:52:38.920 align:start position:0%
the representative that everything in
 
03:52:40.630 --> 03:52:40.640 align:start position:0%
the bill is pretty much in state law but
 
03:52:42.429 --> 03:52:42.439 align:start position:0%
there's two key additions to the bill
 
03:52:44.990 --> 03:52:45.000 align:start position:0%
that are not in state law the first is
 
03:52:47.269 --> 03:52:47.279 align:start position:0%
that it adopts the strict scrutiny test
 
03:52:49.229 --> 03:52:49.239 align:start position:0%
and it creates basically an absolute
 
03:52:51.429 --> 03:52:51.439 align:start position:0%
right for parents in relation to their
 
03:52:53.510 --> 03:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
children in schools and that's counter
 
03:52:54.950 --> 03:52:54.960 align:start position:0%
to the New Hampshire Supreme Court's
 
03:52:57.349 --> 03:52:57.359 align:start position:0%
latest ruling on this case in the case
 
03:52:59.309 --> 03:52:59.319 align:start position:0%
of dovie Manchester School District that
 
03:53:02.870 --> 03:53:02.880 align:start position:0%
was just decided in August of 2024 it re
 
03:53:04.389 --> 03:53:04.399 align:start position:0%
involved whether or not school should be
 
03:53:06.990 --> 03:53:07.000 align:start position:0%
forced to reveal a students lgbtq status
 
03:53:09.149 --> 03:53:09.159 align:start position:0%
to the parents the court said they were
 
03:53:10.870 --> 03:53:10.880 align:start position:0%
basing their decision solely on the New
 
03:53:13.389 --> 03:53:13.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution they said parents
 
03:53:14.910 --> 03:53:14.920 align:start position:0%
do have a fundamental right to raise
 
03:53:16.630 --> 03:53:16.640 align:start position:0%
their children but when applied to the
 
03:53:19.030 --> 03:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
school setting this right is quote not
 
03:53:21.469 --> 03:53:21.479 align:start position:0%
an unqualified right they said that the
 
03:53:23.630 --> 03:53:23.640 align:start position:0%
Manchester policy did not infringe upon
 
03:53:25.349 --> 03:53:25.359 align:start position:0%
the parents rights the parents had other
 
03:53:28.149 --> 03:53:28.159 align:start position:0%
numerous self-help remedies and that any
 
03:53:29.910 --> 03:53:29.920 align:start position:0%
interference quote with parental rights
 
03:53:31.510 --> 03:53:31.520 align:start position:0%
that may result was not of a
 
03:53:33.670 --> 03:53:33.680 align:start position:0%
constitutional Dimension the court
 
03:53:35.469 --> 03:53:35.479 align:start position:0%
concluded it follows that strict
 
03:53:38.030 --> 03:53:38.040 align:start position:0%
scrutiny review is inappropriate and the
 
03:53:40.269 --> 03:53:40.279 align:start position:0%
trial court did not ER by applying the
 
03:53:42.110 --> 03:53:42.120 align:start position:0%
rational basis test that's lawyer talk
 
03:53:43.910 --> 03:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
but what that means is that on page two
 
03:53:47.389 --> 03:53:47.399 align:start position:0%
lines 2 and three where the bill would
 
03:53:49.590 --> 03:53:49.600 align:start position:0%
require the compelling State interest
 
03:53:51.910 --> 03:53:51.920 align:start position:0%
test require that anything be narrowly
 
03:53:54.070 --> 03:53:54.080 align:start position:0%
tailored in no less restrictive means
 
03:53:55.910 --> 03:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
that's the strict scrutiny test the
 
03:53:58.229 --> 03:53:58.239 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court heard a case on this very
 
03:54:00.429 --> 03:54:00.439 align:start position:0%
Bill and say that's the inappropriate
 
03:54:02.309 --> 03:54:02.319 align:start position:0%
test instead you should use the rational
 
03:54:04.510 --> 03:54:04.520 align:start position:0%
basis test and allow the students the
 
03:54:06.870 --> 03:54:06.880 align:start position:0%
schools to do their job so this it's
 
03:54:08.630 --> 03:54:08.640 align:start position:0%
it's a good bill but it goes too far it
 
03:54:10.510 --> 03:54:10.520 align:start position:0%
creates basically an absolute parental
 
03:54:12.510 --> 03:54:12.520 align:start position:0%
right the second problem is the vague
 
03:54:14.550 --> 03:54:14.560 align:start position:0%
standards about what's included and what
 
03:54:16.950 --> 03:54:16.960 align:start position:0%
not included I I'm looking at the new
 
03:54:19.349 --> 03:54:19.359 align:start position:0%
amended version page three lines 13 to
 
03:54:20.950 --> 03:54:20.960 align:start position:0%
17 that says that parental rights are
 
03:54:22.710 --> 03:54:22.720 align:start position:0%
more comprehensive than those listed in
 
03:54:24.790 --> 03:54:24.800 align:start position:0%
the section unless its rights have been
 
03:54:27.149 --> 03:54:27.159 align:start position:0%
legally waved or terminated that part in
 
03:54:29.070 --> 03:54:29.080 align:start position:0%
page two lines 5 to9 where it says
 
03:54:31.429 --> 03:54:31.439 align:start position:0%
including but not limited to so the
 
03:54:33.590 --> 03:54:33.600 align:start position:0%
question is does the absence of specific
 
03:54:36.189 --> 03:54:36.199 align:start position:0%
mention of the rights of lgbtq students
 
03:54:39.389 --> 03:54:39.399 align:start position:0%
does that mean that that's not included
 
03:54:41.229 --> 03:54:41.239 align:start position:0%
in this list or does it mean that it's
 
03:54:43.710 --> 03:54:43.720 align:start position:0%
to be included in the unspecified rights
 
03:54:45.590 --> 03:54:45.600 align:start position:0%
we've had this buil discussed and
 
03:54:47.990 --> 03:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
debated numerous times with dozens of
 
03:54:49.990 --> 03:54:50.000 align:start position:0%
hours of testimony it should be made
 
03:54:51.870 --> 03:54:51.880 align:start position:0%
clear because if you're a school or a
 
03:54:54.309 --> 03:54:54.319 align:start position:0%
teacher you don't know whether or not
 
03:54:56.710 --> 03:54:56.720 align:start position:0%
you can or can't listen to a child who
 
03:54:59.670 --> 03:54:59.680 align:start position:0%
tells you look I'm I'm gay my mom
 
03:55:01.349 --> 03:55:01.359 align:start position:0%
understands my dad doesn't understand
 
03:55:02.830 --> 03:55:02.840 align:start position:0%
what should I do about it how do I
 
03:55:05.429 --> 03:55:05.439 align:start position:0%
negotiate this at home what is the what
 
03:55:07.149 --> 03:55:07.159 align:start position:0%
is the school's obligation what is the
 
03:55:08.790 --> 03:55:08.800 align:start position:0%
parents right there it's there's a
 
03:55:10.630 --> 03:55:10.640 align:start position:0%
chilling effect on schools you might say
 
03:55:11.910 --> 03:55:11.920 align:start position:0%
well what's the difference the
 
03:55:13.990 --> 03:55:14.000 align:start position:0%
difference is that for lgbtq children
 
03:55:16.349 --> 03:55:16.359 align:start position:0%
home is is not always a safe place this
 
03:55:19.790 --> 03:55:19.800 align:start position:0%
is from the Trevor Project 14% of lgbtq
 
03:55:21.750 --> 03:55:21.760 align:start position:0%
Youth report having slept away for the
 
03:55:24.229 --> 03:55:24.239 align:start position:0%
parents because they were kicked out 40%
 
03:55:26.790 --> 03:55:26.800 align:start position:0%
just because they were lgbtq and we know
 
03:55:28.710 --> 03:55:28.720 align:start position:0%
that having a trusted adult just one
 
03:55:31.550 --> 03:55:31.560 align:start position:0%
trusted adult reduces suicide attempts
 
03:55:34.349 --> 03:55:34.359 align:start position:0%
by lgbtq which are very high high
 
03:55:36.790 --> 03:55:36.800 align:start position:0%
incidents by 40% and the Department of
 
03:55:38.950 --> 03:55:38.960 align:start position:0%
Education in the state had a on trusted
 
03:55:40.830 --> 03:55:40.840 align:start position:0%
adult program this bill would run
 
03:55:42.389 --> 03:55:42.399 align:start position:0%
counter counter to it so thank you I
 
03:55:43.590 --> 03:55:43.600 align:start position:0%
guess what I'm saying is I agree with
 
03:55:45.630 --> 03:55:45.640 align:start position:0%
the concept parental rights this bill
 
03:55:48.030 --> 03:55:48.040 align:start position:0%
goes too far it creates two new rights
 
03:55:49.910 --> 03:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
one it makes it an absolute right by
 
03:55:52.389 --> 03:55:52.399 align:start position:0%
adopting strict scrutiny and two it it
 
03:55:53.910 --> 03:55:53.920 align:start position:0%
says here's the list of Rights and then
 
03:55:55.110 --> 03:55:55.120 align:start position:0%
there's a bunch of other things but
 
03:55:57.469 --> 03:55:57.479 align:start position:0%
doesn't say what they are thank you very
 
03:55:59.590 --> 03:55:59.600 align:start position:0%
much would you take
 
03:56:02.550 --> 03:56:02.560 align:start position:0%
questions okay any questions uh
 
03:56:04.750 --> 03:56:04.760 align:start position:0%
representative Lavin sir you'll have to
 
03:56:07.510 --> 03:56:07.520 align:start position:0%
turn your mic back on thank you Mr chair
 
03:56:08.950 --> 03:56:08.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question because
 
03:56:11.389 --> 03:56:11.399 align:start position:0%
the incidence of su suicide is so high
 
03:56:16.070 --> 03:56:16.080 align:start position:0%
in uh LBGTQ children or adolescence uh
 
03:56:18.349 --> 03:56:18.359 align:start position:0%
don't you think the parents the one the
 
03:56:19.990 --> 03:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
most important people in their lives
 
03:56:20.000 --> 03:56:20.910 align:start position:0%
most important people in their lives
should

03:56:20.910 --> 03:56:20.920 align:start position:0%
should
 
03:56:23.149 --> 03:56:23.159 align:start position:0%
know I thinkk you for the question
 
03:56:25.830 --> 03:56:25.840 align:start position:0%
representative love um I do believe that
 
03:56:28.349 --> 03:56:28.359 align:start position:0%
parents is where it starts and what what
 
03:56:30.469 --> 03:56:30.479 align:start position:0%
I did point out and and what's come back
 
03:56:35.070 --> 03:56:35.080 align:start position:0%
to is that 14% one in seven lgbtq youth
 
03:56:37.229 --> 03:56:37.239 align:start position:0%
were kicked out of their homes and
 
03:56:40.030 --> 03:56:40.040 align:start position:0%
largely just because they are lgbtq now
 
03:56:42.189 --> 03:56:42.199 align:start position:0%
for most parents they understand their
 
03:56:43.710 --> 03:56:43.720 align:start position:0%
children they're supportive of them they
 
03:56:45.070 --> 03:56:45.080 align:start position:0%
want to love love them and do anything
 
03:56:47.110 --> 03:56:47.120 align:start position:0%
they can for them but there are some
 
03:56:49.189 --> 03:56:49.199 align:start position:0%
homes where that's not the case and the
 
03:56:51.309 --> 03:56:51.319 align:start position:0%
only place that that child can talk to
 
03:56:54.030 --> 03:56:54.040 align:start position:0%
somebody is maybe their coach maybe a
 
03:56:56.349 --> 03:56:56.359 align:start position:0%
boss or it might be somebody at the
 
03:56:59.070 --> 03:56:59.080 align:start position:0%
school and this bill by creating an
 
03:57:01.269 --> 03:57:01.279 align:start position:0%
absolute right 100% of the rights in
 
03:57:03.189 --> 03:57:03.199 align:start position:0%
this equation you got the child the
 
03:57:05.030 --> 03:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
school and the parent and this bill says
 
03:57:07.189 --> 03:57:07.199 align:start position:0%
the parent gets 100% of the rights the
 
03:57:08.870 --> 03:57:08.880 align:start position:0%
other two parties basically have no
 
03:57:11.189 --> 03:57:11.199 align:start position:0%
rights that's out of balance with with
 
03:57:12.830 --> 03:57:12.840 align:start position:0%
what would be healthy in every single
 
03:57:12.840 --> 03:57:15.630 align:start position:0%
what would be healthy in every single
case

03:57:15.630 --> 03:57:15.640 align:start position:0%
case
 
03:57:17.670 --> 03:57:17.680 align:start position:0%
and I say that also too I'm a parent I
 
03:57:19.429 --> 03:57:19.439 align:start position:0%
had two children so I'm not against
 
03:57:20.950 --> 03:57:20.960 align:start position:0%
parents I'm just saying it's not always
 
03:57:23.070 --> 03:57:23.080 align:start position:0%
it shouldn't be at that ratio seeing
 
03:57:24.349 --> 03:57:24.359 align:start position:0%
nothing else thank you for your
 
03:57:27.229 --> 03:57:27.239 align:start position:0%
testimony chair recognizes Sam Hawkins
 
03:57:40.189 --> 03:57:40.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:42.550 --> 03:57:42.560 align:start position:0%
do good afternoon chairman Pearson
 
03:57:44.229 --> 03:57:44.239 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
03:57:45.830 --> 03:57:45.840 align:start position:0%
my name is Sam Hawkins I'm here today
 
03:57:47.870 --> 03:57:47.880 align:start position:0%
representing Nami New Hampshire I want
 
03:57:49.349 --> 03:57:49.359 align:start position:0%
to be clear from the outset that Nami
 
03:57:51.189 --> 03:57:51.199 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is not taking a position
 
03:57:53.670 --> 03:57:53.680 align:start position:0%
on this bill and as an organization we
 
03:57:55.870 --> 03:57:55.880 align:start position:0%
do not serve just individuals but also
 
03:57:58.469 --> 03:57:58.479 align:start position:0%
families so as such we do believe in the
 
03:58:00.550 --> 03:58:00.560 align:start position:0%
fundamental importance of that parent
 
03:58:03.110 --> 03:58:03.120 align:start position:0%
child relationship uh we do have two
 
03:58:05.149 --> 03:58:05.159 align:start position:0%
concerns with the bill however that I'm
 
03:58:07.750 --> 03:58:07.760 align:start position:0%
here today to represent um I've only had
 
03:58:09.550 --> 03:58:09.560 align:start position:0%
a limited amount of time as others in
 
03:58:11.110 --> 03:58:11.120 align:start position:0%
the audience to review the amendment but
 
03:58:12.790 --> 03:58:12.800 align:start position:0%
I do think these concerns are applicable
 
03:58:16.110 --> 03:58:16.120 align:start position:0%
to both uh um to begin it is our
 
03:58:17.990 --> 03:58:18.000 align:start position:0%
understanding under current law that
 
03:58:20.070 --> 03:58:20.080 align:start position:0%
unless otherwise prohibited by law
 
03:58:22.110 --> 03:58:22.120 align:start position:0%
parents do have access to review all
 
03:58:24.469 --> 03:58:24.479 align:start position:0%
medical records relating to their child
 
03:58:26.830 --> 03:58:26.840 align:start position:0%
uh in regards to the amendment I do have
 
03:58:28.710 --> 03:58:28.720 align:start position:0%
some concerns that it seems that that
 
03:58:31.229 --> 03:58:31.239 align:start position:0%
provision of unless otherwise prohibited
 
03:58:35.229 --> 03:58:35.239 align:start position:0%
law by law is not in there uh further uh
 
03:58:37.469 --> 03:58:37.479 align:start position:0%
this policy as it is provided in House
 
03:58:39.550 --> 03:58:39.560 align:start position:0%
Bill 10 uh we feel does not fully
 
03:58:41.670 --> 03:58:41.680 align:start position:0%
consider all situations where it may
 
03:58:43.750 --> 03:58:43.760 align:start position:0%
potentially be necessary to withhold
 
03:58:46.149 --> 03:58:46.159 align:start position:0%
access access to records uh specifically
 
03:58:47.790 --> 03:58:47.800 align:start position:0%
we feel strongly there should be some
 
03:58:49.950 --> 03:58:49.960 align:start position:0%
mechanism for withholding records if the
 
03:58:51.950 --> 03:58:51.960 align:start position:0%
provider has a reasonable belief that
 
03:58:54.189 --> 03:58:54.199 align:start position:0%
such disclosure will result in abuse or
 
03:58:56.429 --> 03:58:56.439 align:start position:0%
neglect there have been similar bills
 
03:58:58.550 --> 03:58:58.560 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire uh that provide
 
03:59:00.149 --> 03:59:00.159 align:start position:0%
parental access to records I know one
 
03:59:01.870 --> 03:59:01.880 align:start position:0%
came before this committee and that bill
 
03:59:04.110 --> 03:59:04.120 align:start position:0%
saw it necessary to include a similar
 
03:59:05.830 --> 03:59:05.840 align:start position:0%
standard to that by which a provider can
 
03:59:08.710 --> 03:59:08.720 align:start position:0%
deny access uh if the committee is going
 
03:59:10.790 --> 03:59:10.800 align:start position:0%
to add that in we do however feel
 
03:59:12.870 --> 03:59:12.880 align:start position:0%
strongly that the standard used should
 
03:59:14.590 --> 03:59:14.600 align:start position:0%
align with the standards in the state's
 
03:59:17.790 --> 03:59:17.800 align:start position:0%
child protection act uh moving on to our
 
03:59:20.349 --> 03:59:20.359 align:start position:0%
second concern I would again first like
 
03:59:21.750 --> 03:59:21.760 align:start position:0%
to emphasize that the family
 
03:59:24.309 --> 03:59:24.319 align:start position:0%
relationship is the most impactful in a
 
03:59:26.710 --> 03:59:26.720 align:start position:0%
child's life but we also know that that
 
03:59:28.670 --> 03:59:28.680 align:start position:0%
is not the only relationship in a
 
03:59:30.389 --> 03:59:30.399 align:start position:0%
child's life and it takes a full
 
03:59:32.990 --> 03:59:33.000 align:start position:0%
community of support to build a healthy
 
03:59:35.870 --> 03:59:35.880 align:start position:0%
thriving adult uh as such we do have a
 
03:59:37.830 --> 03:59:37.840 align:start position:0%
concern relating to the language of
 
03:59:40.870 --> 03:59:40.880 align:start position:0%
quote attempts to encourage or coer
 
03:59:42.149 --> 03:59:42.159 align:start position:0%
while there's no situation where we
 
03:59:43.550 --> 03:59:43.560 align:start position:0%
believe it is appropriate for an
 
03:59:45.950 --> 03:59:45.960 align:start position:0%
educator to coers a student to withhold
 
03:59:48.710 --> 03:59:48.720 align:start position:0%
info uh we do believe that the way this
 
03:59:51.710 --> 03:59:51.720 align:start position:0%
language is interpreted by uh by
 
03:59:54.710 --> 03:59:54.720 align:start position:0%
students or by Educators uh may have a
 
03:59:57.309 --> 03:59:57.319 align:start position:0%
negative impact on that educator student
 
03:59:59.590 --> 03:59:59.600 align:start position:0%
relationship we know that some children
 
04:00:01.510 --> 04:00:01.520 align:start position:0%
may approach other community members
 
04:00:03.349 --> 04:00:03.359 align:start position:0%
including Educators with their questions
 
04:00:05.149 --> 04:00:05.159 align:start position:0%
or feelings before opening up to their
 
04:00:06.790 --> 04:00:06.800 align:start position:0%
parents this is not because that
 
04:00:09.429 --> 04:00:09.439 align:start position:0%
relationship is less important than the
 
04:00:11.550 --> 04:00:11.560 align:start position:0%
parent relationship or is not because
 
04:00:13.070 --> 04:00:13.080 align:start position:0%
that relationship is more important than
 
04:00:14.790 --> 04:00:14.800 align:start position:0%
the parent relationship but because that
 
04:00:17.030 --> 04:00:17.040 align:start position:0%
relationship is actually a lower Stakes
 
04:00:19.229 --> 04:00:19.239 align:start position:0%
opportunity uh essentially we have some
 
04:00:20.870 --> 04:00:20.880 align:start position:0%
concerns that that language may be
 
04:00:23.349 --> 04:00:23.359 align:start position:0%
broadly interpreted by Educators or
 
04:00:24.950 --> 04:00:24.960 align:start position:0%
students to mean they can't discuss
 
04:00:28.830 --> 04:00:28.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:31.750 --> 04:00:31.760 align:start position:0%
it I apologize I bumped the button uh in
 
04:00:33.830 --> 04:00:33.840 align:start position:0%
closing this may result in teachers not
 
04:00:35.429 --> 04:00:35.439 align:start position:0%
being there for students when they need
 
04:00:37.510 --> 04:00:37.520 align:start position:0%
them or students not being willing to
 
04:00:39.149 --> 04:00:39.159 align:start position:0%
speak to teachers when they need to talk
 
04:00:41.590 --> 04:00:41.600 align:start position:0%
to someone and lastly these
 
04:00:43.269 --> 04:00:43.279 align:start position:0%
conversations are important Stepping
 
04:00:45.189 --> 04:00:45.199 align:start position:0%
Stones to actually building a child's
 
04:00:47.110 --> 04:00:47.120 align:start position:0%
confidence so that they will actually go
 
04:00:48.950 --> 04:00:48.960 align:start position:0%
to their parents rather than going on
 
04:00:51.389 --> 04:00:51.399 align:start position:0%
struggling in silence so with all that
 
04:00:53.309 --> 04:00:53.319 align:start position:0%
in mind uh we ask that if the committee
 
04:00:57.030 --> 04:00:57.040 align:start position:0%
Advance any Bill uh that s does this uh
 
04:00:58.550 --> 04:00:58.560 align:start position:0%
there should be consideration of those
 
04:00:59.950 --> 04:00:59.960 align:start position:0%
concerns and I thank you for your time
 
04:01:01.189 --> 04:01:01.199 align:start position:0%
thank you so much would you take
 
04:01:03.790 --> 04:01:03.800 align:start position:0%
questions absolutely don't see any
 
04:01:06.630 --> 04:01:06.640 align:start position:0%
questions thank you thank
 
04:01:21.710 --> 04:01:21.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:23.149 --> 04:01:23.159 align:start position:0%
good afternoon thank you Mr chairing
 
04:01:25.349 --> 04:01:25.359 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Heather roai and
 
04:01:27.349 --> 04:01:27.359 align:start position:0%
I'm from marac and I'm here today as a
 
04:01:29.110 --> 04:01:29.120 align:start position:0%
proud parent of a public school student
 
04:01:32.349 --> 04:01:32.359 align:start position:0%
to voice my opposition to House Bill 10
 
04:01:33.750 --> 04:01:33.760 align:start position:0%
um I did read over some of the
 
04:01:35.510 --> 04:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
Amendments that were just brought forth
 
04:01:37.070 --> 04:01:37.080 align:start position:0%
um but my biggest concern surrounding
 
04:01:39.070 --> 04:01:39.080 align:start position:0%
this bill is the negative impact that it
 
04:01:40.990 --> 04:01:41.000 align:start position:0%
will have on public school Educators and
 
04:01:42.510 --> 04:01:42.520 align:start position:0%
the education New Hampshire children
 
04:01:44.870 --> 04:01:44.880 align:start position:0%
receive in our Public School
 
04:01:46.750 --> 04:01:46.760 align:start position:0%
I can speak that in marac we already
 
04:01:48.670 --> 04:01:48.680 align:start position:0%
have policies in place from the school
 
04:01:50.389 --> 04:01:50.399 align:start position:0%
board and District regarding
 
04:01:52.790 --> 04:01:52.800 align:start position:0%
reconsideration of materials as well as
 
04:01:54.510 --> 04:01:54.520 align:start position:0%
parents ability to opt their children
 
04:01:56.349 --> 04:01:56.359 align:start position:0%
out of any curriculum portions that they
 
04:01:58.870 --> 04:01:58.880 align:start position:0%
deem objectionable uh this bill is
 
04:02:00.710 --> 04:02:00.720 align:start position:0%
specifically targeting public schools
 
04:02:02.910 --> 04:02:02.920 align:start position:0%
and their Educators giving parents
 
04:02:04.670 --> 04:02:04.680 align:start position:0%
procedures to object to instruction
 
04:02:08.269 --> 04:02:08.279 align:start position:0%
materials based on as noted in line 26c
 
04:02:10.510 --> 04:02:10.520 align:start position:0%
beliefs regarding morality sex and
 
04:02:12.229 --> 04:02:12.239 align:start position:0%
religion or the belief that such
 
04:02:15.030 --> 04:02:15.040 align:start position:0%
materials are harmful parents claiming
 
04:02:16.750 --> 04:02:16.760 align:start position:0%
violations of these Provisions in these
 
04:02:18.910 --> 04:02:18.920 align:start position:0%
bills may bring forth an action for
 
04:02:20.790 --> 04:02:20.800 align:start position:0%
injunctive Relief and damages against
 
04:02:22.950 --> 04:02:22.960 align:start position:0%

04:02:25.030 --> 04:02:25.040 align:start position:0%
teacher including losing their
 
04:02:27.030 --> 04:02:27.040 align:start position:0%
certification many of New Hampshire's
 
04:02:28.790 --> 04:02:28.800 align:start position:0%
school districts are already struggling
 
04:02:30.830 --> 04:02:30.840 align:start position:0%
to find Qualified teachers to fill
 
04:02:32.590 --> 04:02:32.600 align:start position:0%
positions and the provisions and
 
04:02:34.349 --> 04:02:34.359 align:start position:0%
penalties of this bill will increase
 
04:02:36.269 --> 04:02:36.279 align:start position:0%
this problem resulting in a critical
 
04:02:38.030 --> 04:02:38.040 align:start position:0%
shortage of Educators New Hampshire
 
04:02:41.149 --> 04:02:41.159 align:start position:0%
Public Schools one of our amazing par of
 
04:02:42.790 --> 04:02:42.800 align:start position:0%
Professionals in a recent school budget
 
04:02:45.269 --> 04:02:45.279 align:start position:0%
committee meeting stated I don't make a
 
04:02:47.389 --> 04:02:47.399 align:start position:0%
living I make a difference and our
 
04:02:49.790 --> 04:02:49.800 align:start position:0%
teachers do threatening our Public
 
04:02:52.309 --> 04:02:52.319 align:start position:0%
School Educators with a criminal record
 
04:02:53.590 --> 04:02:53.600 align:start position:0%
as it was
 
04:02:55.910 --> 04:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
initially written although amended it's
 
04:02:57.349 --> 04:02:57.359 align:start position:0%
unclear whether or not they would still
 
04:02:59.790 --> 04:02:59.800 align:start position:0%
have a class A misdemeanor as a result
 
04:03:03.030 --> 04:03:03.040 align:start position:0%
of violating these Provisions um if they
 
04:03:05.149 --> 04:03:05.159 align:start position:0%
are in unable to teach and earn an
 
04:03:07.309 --> 04:03:07.319 align:start position:0%
income it's going to have disastrous
 
04:03:09.950 --> 04:03:09.960 align:start position:0%
consequences if this passes educators
 
04:03:12.030 --> 04:03:12.040 align:start position:0%
will undoubtedly limit the diversity and
 
04:03:13.790 --> 04:03:13.800 align:start position:0%
inclusivity of their instructional
 
04:03:16.229 --> 04:03:16.239 align:start position:0%

materials meant for all children simply
 
04:03:31.710 --> 04:03:31.720 align:start position:0%
because one family or a few individuals
 
04:03:34.070 --> 04:03:34.080 align:start position:0%
disagree or find it objectionable our
 
04:03:35.630 --> 04:03:35.640 align:start position:0%

diverse local and Global
 
04:03:43.990 --> 04:03:44.000 align:start position:0%

ultimately our taxpayers will have to

originally introduced and um well I will

talk about the amendment in a moment one
 
04:05:11.469 --> 04:05:11.479 align:start position:0%
of our big oppositions to the bill was
 
04:05:14.510 --> 04:05:14.520 align:start position:0%
that it would class by violations of the
 
04:05:17.510 --> 04:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
bill as a misdemeanor leaving Educators
 
04:05:20.269 --> 04:05:20.279 align:start position:0%
and School staff with a possible
 
04:05:23.189 --> 04:05:23.199 align:start position:0%
criminal record and fine for violating
 
04:05:25.590 --> 04:05:25.600 align:start position:0%
something that had some pretty vague
 
04:05:28.550 --> 04:05:28.560 align:start position:0%
wording in it where you could violate a
 
04:05:30.990 --> 04:05:31.000 align:start position:0%
um right that was not even enumerated in
 
04:05:33.870 --> 04:05:33.880 align:start position:0%
the bill that would be a big problem now
 
04:05:36.189 --> 04:05:36.199 align:start position:0%
we find this amendment is an
 
04:05:38.389 --> 04:05:38.399 align:start position:0%
improvement uh it did take out that
 
04:05:40.149 --> 04:05:40.159 align:start position:0%
language so we are pleased to see that
 
04:05:42.070 --> 04:05:42.080 align:start position:0%
it also took out the attempt to coers
 
04:05:44.510 --> 04:05:44.520 align:start position:0%
language was very confusing we do still
 
04:05:46.830 --> 04:05:46.840 align:start position:0%
have some concerns and um some of them
 
04:05:49.469 --> 04:05:49.479 align:start position:0%
have also been already been mentioned um
 
04:05:54.630 --> 04:05:54.640 align:start position:0%
on page two lines 5 through 11 um
 
04:05:56.750 --> 04:05:56.760 align:start position:0%
someone already testified about this
 
04:05:58.750 --> 04:05:58.760 align:start position:0%
earlier we do agree that you know the
 
04:06:00.189 --> 04:06:00.199 align:start position:0%
parents obviously have the right to
 
04:06:01.910 --> 04:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
direct the education and care of their
 
04:06:03.389 --> 04:06:03.399 align:start position:0%
children and direct the upbringing and
 
04:06:05.309 --> 04:06:05.319 align:start position:0%
moral and religious training of their
 
04:06:08.429 --> 04:06:08.439 align:start position:0%
children but that is not an absolute and
 
04:06:11.149 --> 04:06:11.159 align:start position:0%
unqualified right in all circumstances
 
04:06:13.309 --> 04:06:13.319 align:start position:0%
when you Jose that against sending a
 
04:06:16.070 --> 04:06:16.080 align:start position:0%
child to public school if every single
 
04:06:18.790 --> 04:06:18.800 align:start position:0%
parent insisted they had the right to
 
04:06:21.389 --> 04:06:21.399 align:start position:0%
direct what goes on in the classroom and
 
04:06:23.110 --> 04:06:23.120 align:start position:0%
parents have different ideas of what's
 
04:06:24.670 --> 04:06:24.680 align:start position:0%
supposed to be going on in that
 
04:06:27.149 --> 04:06:27.159 align:start position:0%
classroom how do you
 
04:06:31.030 --> 04:06:31.040 align:start position:0%
teach what do you teach when you send a
 
04:06:33.990 --> 04:06:34.000 align:start position:0%
child to public school how we decide
 
04:06:35.870 --> 04:06:35.880 align:start position:0%
what to teach is the job of the local
 
04:06:38.469 --> 04:06:38.479 align:start position:0%
school board they adopt the curriculum
 
04:06:40.790 --> 04:06:40.800 align:start position:0%
so if we could somehow maybe redirect
 
04:06:44.950 --> 04:06:44.960 align:start position:0%
this to have parents either
 
04:06:47.950 --> 04:06:47.960 align:start position:0%
exercise the opt out provision if there
 
04:06:50.309 --> 04:06:50.319 align:start position:0%
is something they seriously object to
 
04:06:53.309 --> 04:06:53.319 align:start position:0%
and or engage in the school board's
 
04:06:57.189 --> 04:06:57.199 align:start position:0%
curriculum adoption procedure and policy
 
04:06:59.309 --> 04:06:59.319 align:start position:0%
and materials adoption procedure and
 
04:07:01.830 --> 04:07:01.840 align:start position:0%
policy because school boards are elected
 
04:07:04.110 --> 04:07:04.120 align:start position:0%
representatives of their local community
 
04:07:07.590 --> 04:07:07.600 align:start position:0%
and they do have um um committees that
 
04:07:10.990 --> 04:07:11.000 align:start position:0%
work on this and welcome parent
 
04:07:13.309 --> 04:07:13.319 align:start position:0%
engagement that's how we decide what
 
04:07:14.630 --> 04:07:14.640 align:start position:0%
gets T in the
 
04:07:14.640 --> 04:07:16.510 align:start position:0%
gets T in the
classroom

04:07:16.510 --> 04:07:16.520 align:start position:0%
classroom
 
04:07:19.670 --> 04:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
this piece of the bill could very easily
 
04:07:22.110 --> 04:07:22.120 align:start position:0%
lead to individual parents trying to
 
04:07:23.790 --> 04:07:23.800 align:start position:0%
micromanage what all children get to
 
04:07:25.309 --> 04:07:25.319 align:start position:0%
learn in the classroom and that's not
 
04:07:26.750 --> 04:07:26.760 align:start position:0%
right I don't think that's what you're
 
04:07:29.550 --> 04:07:29.560 align:start position:0%
trying to do um we also have similar
 
04:07:34.309 --> 04:07:34.319 align:start position:0%
concerns to the um line 26 on page C 26
 
04:07:37.630 --> 04:07:37.640 align:start position:0%
and 27 about instructing M instructional
 
04:07:40.030 --> 04:07:40.040 align:start position:0%
materials um certainly if you want to
 
04:07:42.149 --> 04:07:42.159 align:start position:0%
review instructional materials I
 
04:07:44.469 --> 04:07:44.479 align:start position:0%
understand time to wrap it up
 
04:07:48.429 --> 04:07:48.439 align:start position:0%
that also um repeated request for review
 
04:07:50.790 --> 04:07:50.800 align:start position:0%
every single piece of paper every single
 
04:07:53.309 --> 04:07:53.319 align:start position:0%
worksheet every single example used in
 
04:07:56.189 --> 04:07:56.199 align:start position:0%
the classroom has a chilling effect on
 
04:07:58.269 --> 04:07:58.279 align:start position:0%
what teachers provide to students and
 
04:08:01.550 --> 04:08:01.560 align:start position:0%
get okay we've finished now
 
04:08:01.560 --> 04:08:03.149 align:start position:0%
get okay we've finished now
um

04:08:03.149 --> 04:08:03.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:08:05.030 --> 04:08:05.040 align:start position:0%
boy I
 
04:08:09.510 --> 04:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:12.750 --> 04:08:12.760 align:start position:0%
questions representative love thank you
 
04:08:15.109 --> 04:08:15.119 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and uh thank you for taking my
 
04:08:17.710 --> 04:08:17.720 align:start position:0%
question would you would you believe
 
04:08:20.870 --> 04:08:20.880 align:start position:0%
that uh on on primary day I had a
 
04:08:23.349 --> 04:08:23.359 align:start position:0%
constituent come up to me and a member
 
04:08:26.630 --> 04:08:26.640 align:start position:0%
of Our Town Council M and told us that
 
04:08:29.830 --> 04:08:29.840 align:start position:0%
uh his 8-year-old daughter
 
04:08:33.510 --> 04:08:33.520 align:start position:0%
was coerced or spoken to by a by by a
 
04:08:35.910 --> 04:08:35.920 align:start position:0%
teacher's aid and told that if you don't
 
04:08:37.510 --> 04:08:37.520 align:start position:0%
like being a girl we have pills that'll
 
04:08:40.349 --> 04:08:40.359 align:start position:0%
make you a boy do you believe nothing's
 
04:08:43.950 --> 04:08:43.960 align:start position:0%
been done to that there's been there's
 
04:08:45.790 --> 04:08:45.800 align:start position:0%
been no disciplinary action taken
 
04:08:49.189 --> 04:08:49.199 align:start position:0%
against that that uh teachers
 
04:08:52.790 --> 04:08:52.800 align:start position:0%
Aid I I cannot comment on that because I
 
04:08:55.590 --> 04:08:55.600 align:start position:0%
do not know the whole story and I'm not
 
04:08:56.670 --> 04:08:56.680 align:start position:0%
sure that you know the whole story
 
04:08:59.109 --> 04:08:59.119 align:start position:0%
either I'm sorry to say but you're not
 
04:09:03.429 --> 04:09:03.439 align:start position:0%
in in the um invest investigatory
 
04:09:06.429 --> 04:09:06.439 align:start position:0%
process in that school are you or in the
 
04:09:08.149 --> 04:09:08.159 align:start position:0%
district or with the Department of Ed
 
04:09:10.910 --> 04:09:10.920 align:start position:0%
and neither am I I did turn it over to
 
04:09:13.510 --> 04:09:13.520 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education
 
04:09:15.550 --> 04:09:15.560 align:start position:0%
so they are following the the process
 
04:09:17.670 --> 04:09:17.680 align:start position:0%
and they will they will certainly look
 
04:09:21.750 --> 04:09:21.760 align:start position:0%
into it um we we have certainly heard
 
04:09:23.710 --> 04:09:23.720 align:start position:0%
from many places where they have looked
 
04:09:23.720 --> 04:09:25.309 align:start position:0%
from many places where they have looked
into

04:09:25.309 --> 04:09:25.319 align:start position:0%
into
 
04:09:27.910 --> 04:09:27.920 align:start position:0%
complaints representative
 
04:09:30.109 --> 04:09:30.119 align:start position:0%
patrino thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
04:09:33.630 --> 04:09:33.640 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question would you say
 
04:09:37.590 --> 04:09:37.600 align:start position:0%
that there are procedures um when a
 
04:09:40.389 --> 04:09:40.399 align:start position:0%
teacher uh violates their professional
 
04:09:43.750 --> 04:09:43.760 align:start position:0%
conduct um that there are procedures in
 
04:09:46.349 --> 04:09:46.359 align:start position:0%
place to uh address those things
 
04:09:48.750 --> 04:09:48.760 align:start position:0%
accordingly that would be separate from
 
04:09:51.030 --> 04:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
this legislation there are procedures
 
04:09:54.189 --> 04:09:54.199 align:start position:0%
there are uh depending upon what the
 
04:09:56.070 --> 04:09:56.080 align:start position:0%
concern is they are either employment
 
04:10:00.189 --> 04:10:00.199 align:start position:0%
procedures or they are um you know code
 
04:10:02.109 --> 04:10:02.119 align:start position:0%
of conduct procedures and the
 
04:10:03.670 --> 04:10:03.680 align:start position:0%
investigation either starts at the local
 
04:10:05.469 --> 04:10:05.479 align:start position:0%
level or starts at the state level but
 
04:10:08.630 --> 04:10:08.640 align:start position:0%
there's a whole um series of procedures
 
04:10:10.189 --> 04:10:10.199 align:start position:0%
that are followed and yes uh
 
04:10:11.830 --> 04:10:11.840 align:start position:0%
investigations do indeed happen
 
04:10:14.830 --> 04:10:14.840 align:start position:0%
frequently we um we do hear about them
 
04:10:17.590 --> 04:10:17.600 align:start position:0%
all the time through their Union
 
04:10:19.550 --> 04:10:19.560 align:start position:0%
yes thank
 
04:10:22.349 --> 04:10:22.359 align:start position:0%

Stratton from the New Hampshire Medical
 
04:10:33.070 --> 04:10:33.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:35.590 --> 04:10:35.600 align:start position:0%
handouts well we would have looked at it
 
04:10:38.070 --> 04:10:38.080 align:start position:0%
and not you so being a good teacher you
 
04:10:38.080 --> 04:10:43.429 align:start position:0%
and not you so being a good teacher you
didn't

04:10:45.469 --> 04:10:45.479 align:start position:0%
I remember the days when handouts we
 
04:10:47.109 --> 04:10:47.119 align:start position:0%
always used to pick them up and sniff
 
04:10:48.910 --> 04:10:48.920 align:start position:0%
them because of remember those ditos
 
04:10:52.269 --> 04:10:52.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:54.469 --> 04:10:54.479 align:start position:0%
ditos amazing how powerful those
 
04:10:57.630 --> 04:10:57.640 align:start position:0%
memories are the sense of
 
04:11:00.469 --> 04:11:00.479 align:start position:0%
smell yeah why don't you just hold on
 
04:11:02.389 --> 04:11:02.399 align:start position:0%
for one little second before the clock
 
04:11:23.510 --> 04:11:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:26.590 --> 04:11:26.600 align:start position:0%
go good afternoon um chairman and
 
04:11:28.950 --> 04:11:28.960 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is
 
04:11:30.870 --> 04:11:30.880 align:start position:0%
Kathy Stratton and I'm the New Hampshire
 
04:11:33.670 --> 04:11:33.680 align:start position:0%
Medical Society CEO speaking for the
 
04:11:36.590 --> 04:11:36.600 align:start position:0%
society in opposition of Health Bill 10
 
04:11:38.229 --> 04:11:38.239 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the society I'd like to
 
04:11:40.710 --> 04:11:40.720 align:start position:0%
begin by reiterating that we fully
 
04:11:43.309 --> 04:11:43.319 align:start position:0%
recognize and value the important role
 
04:11:45.389 --> 04:11:45.399 align:start position:0%
that parents Guardians and Advocates
 
04:11:48.469 --> 04:11:48.479 align:start position:0%
play in the care and treatment of minors
 
04:11:50.950 --> 04:11:50.960 align:start position:0%
we have serious concerns however about
 
04:11:54.229 --> 04:11:54.239 align:start position:0%
how the proposed house bill would
 
04:11:56.790 --> 04:11:56.800 align:start position:0%
interfere with the fundamental physician
 
04:11:59.269 --> 04:11:59.279 align:start position:0%
patient relationship and the punitive
 
04:12:02.630 --> 04:12:02.640 align:start position:0%
consequences it would impose um for Med
 
04:12:04.349 --> 04:12:04.359 align:start position:0%
on medical professionals who are working
 
04:12:05.670 --> 04:12:05.680 align:start position:0%
to treat
 
04:12:08.469 --> 04:12:08.479 align:start position:0%
minors speaking specifically to section
 
04:12:10.750 --> 04:12:10.760 align:start position:0%
three that addresses Health Care
 
04:12:13.910 --> 04:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
Services the society's position is based
 
04:12:15.349 --> 04:12:15.359 align:start position:0%
on the premise that Health Care
 
04:12:17.670 --> 04:12:17.680 align:start position:0%
Providers must have the autonomy to make
 
04:12:19.790 --> 04:12:19.800 align:start position:0%
medical decisions that are in the best
 
04:12:21.630 --> 04:12:21.640 align:start position:0%
interest of their patients the
 
04:12:24.750 --> 04:12:24.760 align:start position:0%
provisions within section uh uh page
 
04:12:27.710 --> 04:12:27.720 align:start position:0%
five uh line number 14 that begins the
 
04:12:29.469 --> 04:12:29.479 align:start position:0%
parental consent for healthc care
 
04:12:32.790 --> 04:12:32.800 align:start position:0%
services introduces specific barriers to
 
04:12:35.429 --> 04:12:35.439 align:start position:0%
this autonomy specifically the first
 
04:12:37.910 --> 04:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
point of the bill States except as
 
04:12:39.870 --> 04:12:39.880 align:start position:0%
otherwise provided by law or a court
 
04:12:42.469 --> 04:12:42.479 align:start position:0%
order a healthc care practitioner or an
 
04:12:44.429 --> 04:12:44.439 align:start position:0%
individual employed by such healthc care
 
04:12:47.429 --> 04:12:47.439 align:start position:0%
practitioner may not provide or solicit
 
04:12:49.790 --> 04:12:49.800 align:start position:0%
Arrangement solicit or arrange to
 
04:12:52.830 --> 04:12:52.840 align:start position:0%
provide Health Care Services or prescrib
 
04:12:55.389 --> 04:12:55.399 align:start position:0%
medicinal drugs to a minor without first
 
04:12:58.910 --> 04:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
obtaining written parental consent this
 
04:13:00.950 --> 04:13:00.960 align:start position:0%
pres provision would require parental

04:13:04.950 --> 04:13:04.960 align:start position:0%
schedule an appointment for a miner such
 
04:13:07.309 --> 04:13:07.319 align:start position:0%
a law would create delays in treatment
 
04:13:09.189 --> 04:13:09.199 align:start position:0%
and potentially dissuade miners from
 
04:13:11.870 --> 04:13:11.880 align:start position:0%
seeking care particularly those who may
 
04:13:14.590 --> 04:13:14.600 align:start position:0%
fear for their safety or
 
04:13:16.990 --> 04:13:17.000 align:start position:0%

stigma surrounding mental health care
 
04:13:20.870 --> 04:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
and substance use treatment it's
 
04:13:22.830 --> 04:13:22.840 align:start position:0%
critical to recognize that additional
 
04:13:25.309 --> 04:13:25.319 align:start position:0%
barriers this law would introduce could
 
04:13:27.510 --> 04:13:27.520 align:start position:0%
discourage these vulnerable individuals
 
04:13:31.189 --> 04:13:31.199 align:start position:0%
from seeking care resulting in life

life-threatening
 
04:13:35.070 --> 04:13:35.080 align:start position:0%
consequences there are situations where
 
04:13:37.389 --> 04:13:37.399 align:start position:0%
the protection of a Minor's confident
 
04:13:39.429 --> 04:13:39.439 align:start position:0%
confidentiality is Paramount to their
 
04:13:42.109 --> 04:13:42.119 align:start position:0%
health and well-being under the proposed
 
04:13:43.590 --> 04:13:43.600 align:start position:0%
Bill Healthcare provid ERS would be
 
04:13:46.469 --> 04:13:46.479 align:start position:0%
forced to prioritize navigating legal
 
04:13:48.830 --> 04:13:48.840 align:start position:0%
and custodial complexities over
 
04:13:50.830 --> 04:13:50.840 align:start position:0%
providing the necessary care to the
 
04:13:53.389 --> 04:13:53.399 align:start position:0%
child this creates a direct conflict
 
04:13:57.550 --> 04:13:57.560 align:start position:0%
with medical ethics and prioritizes
 
04:13:59.870 --> 04:13:59.880 align:start position:0%
which prioritizes patient safety and
 
04:14:02.510 --> 04:14:02.520 align:start position:0%

04:14:05.469 --> 04:14:05.479 align:start position:0%
with invulnerable situations the
 
04:14:07.349 --> 04:14:07.359 align:start position:0%
society's position in opposition of
 
04:14:09.550 --> 04:14:09.560 align:start position:0%
Health Bill 10 aligns with our mission
 
04:14:12.030 --> 04:14:12.040 align:start position:0%
to promote patient and public health if
 
04:14:13.670 --> 04:14:13.680 align:start position:0%
passed this bill would create undue
 
04:14:16.229 --> 04:14:16.239 align:start position:0%
barriers to care undermine the physician
 
04:14:18.389 --> 04:14:18.399 align:start position:0%

Professionals who are dedicated to
 
04:14:25.229 --> 04:14:25.239 align:start position:0%
protecting and healing children we
 
04:14:27.750 --> 04:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
believe that house bill 10 would have de
 
04:14:29.950 --> 04:14:29.960 align:start position:0%
devastating consequences for minors in
 
04:14:31.790 --> 04:14:31.800 align:start position:0%
need of medical and Mental Health
 
04:14:34.269 --> 04:14:34.279 align:start position:0%
Services therefore we respectfully urge
 
04:14:36.469 --> 04:14:36.479 align:start position:0%
you to vote in expedient to legislate on
 
04:14:38.349 --> 04:14:38.359 align:start position:0%
heal spill 10 thank you for your time
 
04:14:43.309 --> 04:14:43.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:45.790 --> 04:14:45.800 align:start position:0%
representative Raymond um thank you
 
04:14:48.149 --> 04:14:48.159 align:start position:0%
chairman Pearson and um thank you Mr
 
04:14:50.710 --> 04:14:50.720 align:start position:0%
Stratton for taking my question um so
 
04:14:52.910 --> 04:14:52.920 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to apply this section that
 
04:14:54.670 --> 04:14:54.680 align:start position:0%
you're talking about on page five to
 
04:14:56.429 --> 04:14:56.439 align:start position:0%
real life because I'm I'm a parent of
 
04:14:59.670 --> 04:14:59.680 align:start position:0%
teenagers and so I'm going to give you a
 
04:15:01.309 --> 04:15:01.319 align:start position:0%
situation that happened this week and
 
04:15:04.309 --> 04:15:04.319 align:start position:0%
tell me if this um bill would change how
 
04:15:08.349 --> 04:15:08.359 align:start position:0%
the process worked so my um 14-year-old
 
04:15:10.910 --> 04:15:10.920 align:start position:0%
is having her wisdom teeth out on Friday
 
04:15:13.910 --> 04:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
and we have um prescription she's
 
04:15:14.870 --> 04:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
supposed to have a prescription
 
04:15:16.710 --> 04:15:16.720 align:start position:0%
mouthwash that she's supposed to use
 
04:15:19.030 --> 04:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
prior to the surgery and then for
 
04:15:21.910 --> 04:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
several days after the surgery um but it
 
04:15:24.710 --> 04:15:24.720 align:start position:0%
didn't get called in to the pharmacy
 
04:15:28.429 --> 04:15:28.439 align:start position:0%
with the antibiotics so I called them
 
04:15:32.229 --> 04:15:32.239 align:start position:0%
from my phone this morning and said hey
 
04:15:33.830 --> 04:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
um I didn't get the prescription for the
 
04:15:36.510 --> 04:15:36.520 align:start position:0%
mouthwash I remember us talking about it
 
04:15:39.149 --> 04:15:39.159 align:start position:0%
I've signed nothing can you call it in
 
04:15:41.429 --> 04:15:41.439 align:start position:0%
to Hanford and I'll pick it up on my way
 
04:15:43.950 --> 04:15:43.960 align:start position:0%
home from the State House afternoon and
 
04:15:46.790 --> 04:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
they said sure no problem we'll call it
 
04:15:48.870 --> 04:15:48.880 align:start position:0%
in because we know that you your
 
04:15:51.030 --> 04:15:51.040 align:start position:0%
daughter needs this and so I'm going to
 
04:15:52.750 --> 04:15:52.760 align:start position:0%
go pick that up tonight and then she'll
 
04:15:56.630 --> 04:15:56.640 align:start position:0%
start it Thursday if this is passed will
 
04:15:59.189 --> 04:15:59.199 align:start position:0%
I have to now drive to the oral
 
04:16:01.469 --> 04:16:01.479 align:start position:0%
surgeon's office and sign a permission
 
04:16:04.510 --> 04:16:04.520 align:start position:0%
slip for them to write that prescription
 
04:16:06.750 --> 04:16:06.760 align:start position:0%
for the mouthwash that we knew was
 
04:16:08.429 --> 04:16:08.439 align:start position:0%
coming because I have older children who
 
04:16:13.389 --> 04:16:13.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:16.590 --> 04:16:16.600 align:start position:0%
you know I'm not an attorney so um it's
 
04:16:18.189 --> 04:16:18.199 align:start position:0%
it's a great question because the bill
 
04:16:20.950 --> 04:16:20.960 align:start position:0%
does State written parental consent and
 
04:16:24.309 --> 04:16:24.319 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure um how that would apply um
 
04:16:26.590 --> 04:16:26.600 align:start position:0%
you know whether your initial statement
 
04:16:28.670 --> 04:16:28.680 align:start position:0%
of consent for the surgery would have
 
04:16:30.670 --> 04:16:30.680 align:start position:0%
applied I I just I just don't know we
 
04:16:32.990 --> 04:16:33.000 align:start position:0%
would have to consult with attorneys on
 
04:16:37.990 --> 04:16:38.000 align:start position:0%
that um but it does create a barrier and
 
04:16:40.349 --> 04:16:40.359 align:start position:0%
um you know I think that that's that's a
 
04:16:47.910 --> 04:16:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:49.510 --> 04:16:49.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony the chair
 
04:17:05.109 --> 04:17:05.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:08.309 --> 04:17:08.319 align:start position:0%
minutes good afternoon um Amry Banfield
 
04:17:10.149 --> 04:17:10.159 align:start position:0%
parental rights Advocate focused on
 
04:17:13.429 --> 04:17:13.439 align:start position:0%
excellence and education I do come in
 
04:17:16.349 --> 04:17:16.359 align:start position:0%
support of this bill however there is a
 
04:17:18.550 --> 04:17:18.560 align:start position:0%
glaring Omission in it and I want to go
 
04:17:21.750 --> 04:17:21.760 align:start position:0%
through that um the parental rights bill
 
04:17:23.950 --> 04:17:23.960 align:start position:0%
should be free of a laundry list of what
 
04:17:26.830 --> 04:17:26.840 align:start position:0%
Democrats and Republicans want it should
 
04:17:30.309 --> 04:17:30.319 align:start position:0%
be focused on parents authentic rights
 
04:17:32.910 --> 04:17:32.920 align:start position:0%
to care for their children a student's
 
04:17:35.870 --> 04:17:35.880 align:start position:0%
personal information is now a commodity
 
04:17:38.910 --> 04:17:38.920 align:start position:0%
by edtech venders Power School released
 
04:17:41.950 --> 04:17:41.960 align:start position:0%
a statement a short time ago notifying
 
04:17:43.710 --> 04:17:43.720 align:start position:0%
everyone about a dat data breach
 
04:17:45.229 --> 04:17:45.239 align:start position:0%
personal information on students
 
04:17:47.469 --> 04:17:47.479 align:start position:0%
including their social security number
 
04:17:49.670 --> 04:17:49.680 align:start position:0%
mental health information and other
 
04:17:51.950 --> 04:17:51.960 align:start position:0%
sensitive data points were captured by
 
04:17:54.389 --> 04:17:54.399 align:start position:0%
hackers but what most people don't know
 
04:17:56.269 --> 04:17:56.279 align:start position:0%
is that power school is currently being
 
04:17:59.149 --> 04:17:59.159 align:start position:0%
sued for sharing and selling student
 
04:18:01.990 --> 04:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
data from the lawsuit it says power
 
04:18:03.990 --> 04:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
school without effective consent
 
04:18:05.830 --> 04:18:05.840 align:start position:0%
collects stores analyzes and shares
 
04:18:08.149 --> 04:18:08.159 align:start position:0%
student sensitive data which it acquires
 
04:18:10.550 --> 04:18:10.560 align:start position:0%
through its educational technology
 
04:18:12.790 --> 04:18:12.800 align:start position:0%
products that it sells to schools and to
 
04:18:14.870 --> 04:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
school districts the information Power
 
04:18:17.990 --> 04:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
School takes from students is virtually
 
04:18:20.510 --> 04:18:20.520 align:start position:0%
unlimited uh it's 87 Pages I've read
 
04:18:22.349 --> 04:18:22.359 align:start position:0%
most of it I would suggest you do I will
 
04:18:24.630 --> 04:18:24.640 align:start position:0%
send you the link edtech vendors are
 
04:18:27.229 --> 04:18:27.239 align:start position:0%
collecting very specific data and claim
 
04:18:30.189 --> 04:18:30.199 align:start position:0%
that they own the intellectual property
 
04:18:32.429 --> 04:18:32.439 align:start position:0%
of these students that means that they
 
04:18:35.309 --> 04:18:35.319 align:start position:0%
are also storing emails in child that
 
04:18:37.070 --> 04:18:37.080 align:start position:0%
the child sends and receives so
 
04:18:39.109 --> 04:18:39.119 align:start position:0%
everybody in the world can access the
 
04:18:40.870 --> 04:18:40.880 align:start position:0%
student information but for some reason
 
04:18:44.070 --> 04:18:44.080 align:start position:0%
parents can't isn't that interesting if
 
04:18:46.309 --> 04:18:46.319 align:start position:0%
you have children using a school issued
 
04:18:48.389 --> 04:18:48.399 align:start position:0%
Chromebook where they access all of the
 
04:18:51.870 --> 04:18:51.880 align:start position:0%
Ed technnology good luck this is how
 
04:18:53.710 --> 04:18:53.720 align:start position:0%
they also develop a psychological
 
04:18:56.149 --> 04:18:56.159 align:start position:0%
profile on children there was an article
 
04:18:57.710 --> 04:18:57.720 align:start position:0%
in the Wall Street Journal several years
 
04:18:59.830 --> 04:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
ago from a medical professional in New
 
04:19:01.950 --> 04:19:01.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and it's called have you seen
 
04:19:04.510 --> 04:19:04.520 align:start position:0%
Junior's psych profile and that is
 
04:19:06.109 --> 04:19:06.119 align:start position:0%
because of the vendors that are
 
04:19:08.030 --> 04:19:08.040 align:start position:0%
collecting all of this Behavior mental
 
04:19:08.040 --> 04:19:09.229 align:start position:0%
collecting all of this Behavior mental
health

04:19:09.229 --> 04:19:09.239 align:start position:0%
health
 
04:19:11.710 --> 04:19:11.720 align:start position:0%
information why are we allowing a school
 
04:19:14.349 --> 04:19:14.359 align:start position:0%
or institution to claim ownership of my
 
04:19:16.950 --> 04:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
child's intellectual property can you
 
04:19:19.750 --> 04:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
even describe what that means data is
 
04:19:22.269 --> 04:19:22.279 align:start position:0%
gold to data Brokers and on the web
 
04:19:24.910 --> 04:19:24.920 align:start position:0%
they're the technology with the for the
 
04:19:26.750 --> 04:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
technology companies none of this should
 
04:19:29.510 --> 04:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
be shared sold or even accessed without
 
04:19:29.520 --> 04:19:30.469 align:start position:0%
be shared sold or even accessed without
parental

04:19:30.469 --> 04:19:30.479 align:start position:0%
parental
 
04:19:34.670 --> 04:19:34.680 align:start position:0%
consent in addition to what was brought
 
04:19:37.389 --> 04:19:37.399 align:start position:0%
up data sharing used to be illegal 10
 
04:19:39.309 --> 04:19:39.319 align:start position:0%
years ago you couldn't do this but it's
 
04:19:41.149 --> 04:19:41.159 align:start position:0%
legal now because there's a loophole in
 
04:19:43.870 --> 04:19:43.880 align:start position:0%
in student Privacy Law so this this kind
 
04:19:46.910 --> 04:19:46.920 align:start position:0%
of legislation is good going forward
 
04:19:48.510 --> 04:19:48.520 align:start position:0%
that's why it is
 
04:19:51.269 --> 04:19:51.279 align:start position:0%
needed uh every student succeed act
 
04:19:53.389 --> 04:19:53.399 align:start position:0%
requires mental health professionals in
 
04:19:55.309 --> 04:19:55.319 align:start position:0%
the school to obtain consent from
 
04:19:57.469 --> 04:19:57.479 align:start position:0%
parents on me Mental Health Services or
 
04:19:59.429 --> 04:19:59.439 align:start position:0%
assessments so if that's a chilling
 
04:20:01.710 --> 04:20:01.720 align:start position:0%
effect guess what people in our school
 
04:20:03.870 --> 04:20:03.880 align:start position:0%
are are breaking federal law because
 
04:20:05.870 --> 04:20:05.880 align:start position:0%
they should be doing it already so if
 
04:20:07.550 --> 04:20:07.560 align:start position:0%
parent locks or if a child walks up to a
 
04:20:09.710 --> 04:20:09.720 align:start position:0%
teacher and begins CH chatting about
 
04:20:11.670 --> 04:20:11.680 align:start position:0%
their mental health information that

thank you very much Mr chair members of
 
04:20:46.670 --> 04:20:46.680 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record my name is
 
04:20:48.750 --> 04:20:48.760 align:start position:0%
Dave luno uh representing the people of

Hopkinson and Bo just m County District
 
04:20:55.189 --> 04:20:55.199 align:start position:0%
9 but as I also like to say Granite
 
04:20:58.269 --> 04:20:58.279 align:start position:0%
Staters from every corner of uh of our
 
04:21:00.070 --> 04:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
wonderful State because what we've got
 
04:21:02.109 --> 04:21:02.119 align:start position:0%
before us today is a bill that affects
 
04:21:03.910 --> 04:21:03.920 align:start position:0%
all of us and we all have statewide
 
04:21:05.910 --> 04:21:05.920 align:start position:0%
responsibilities so I just want to get
 
04:21:09.670 --> 04:21:09.680 align:start position:0%
to um get to one um uh one piece and and
 
04:21:12.590 --> 04:21:12.600 align:start position:0%
just to lay the groundwork a little bit
 
04:21:15.750 --> 04:21:15.760 align:start position:0%
one of the very last things the last
 
04:21:20.189 --> 04:21:20.199 align:start position:0%
legislature did before um breaking in
 
04:21:22.750 --> 04:21:22.760 align:start position:0%
December was to uh was to approve
 
04:21:25.510 --> 04:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
changes to what are called The Ed 306
 
04:21:28.109 --> 04:21:28.119 align:start position:0%
rules and I spent 12 years on a school
 
04:21:29.950 --> 04:21:29.960 align:start position:0%
board and I never heard of the Ed 306
 
04:21:31.870 --> 04:21:31.880 align:start position:0%
rules but these are the rules that set
 
04:21:35.269 --> 04:21:35.279 align:start position:0%
the minimum academic standards um for uh
 
04:21:37.149 --> 04:21:37.159 align:start position:0%
for all of our Public Schools across the
 
04:21:39.870 --> 04:21:39.880 align:start position:0%
state and so one of the things that
 
04:21:42.910 --> 04:21:42.920 align:start position:0%
really became obvious during this um
 
04:21:46.189 --> 04:21:46.199 align:start position:0%
during this work is that um is that the
 
04:21:47.950 --> 04:21:47.960 align:start position:0%
rules that had been had been in place
 
04:21:51.469 --> 04:21:51.479 align:start position:0%
for the last decade were replaced with
 
04:21:53.790 --> 04:21:53.800 align:start position:0%
rules that have been around in some
 
04:21:57.950 --> 04:21:57.960 align:start position:0%
cases more than 20 years
 
04:22:00.950 --> 04:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
so what we're looking at now as minimum
 
04:22:03.030 --> 04:22:03.040 align:start position:0%
standards minimum state standards for
 
04:22:05.830 --> 04:22:05.840 align:start position:0%
schools are really low standards and in
 
04:22:07.550 --> 04:22:07.560 align:start position:0%
some case no
 
04:22:09.910 --> 04:22:09.920 align:start position:0%
standards standards for superintendents
 
04:22:12.030 --> 04:22:12.040 align:start position:0%
were eliminated standards for school
 
04:22:14.750 --> 04:22:14.760 align:start position:0%
business officers were were eliminated
 
04:22:16.309 --> 04:22:16.319 align:start position:0%
and standards for curriculum and
 
04:22:18.309 --> 04:22:18.319 align:start position:0%
instruction were changed and watered
 
04:22:21.030 --> 04:22:21.040 align:start position:0%
down so so heavily uh they don't even
 
04:22:23.189 --> 04:22:23.199 align:start position:0%
resemble what is being taught in schools
 
04:22:26.189 --> 04:22:26.199 align:start position:0%
today so it's an unfortunate Hallmark of
 
04:22:27.349 --> 04:22:27.359 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Department of
 
04:22:29.630 --> 04:22:29.640 align:start position:0%
Education the commissioner and the state
 
04:22:33.510 --> 04:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
board so I'm specifically looking at
 
04:22:38.229 --> 04:22:38.239 align:start position:0%
page four lines 36 and 37 where where
 
04:22:41.670 --> 04:22:41.680 align:start position:0%
it's it says in the in the in the um
 
04:22:43.030 --> 04:22:43.040 align:start position:0%
Bill of Rights
 
04:22:44.830 --> 04:22:44.840 align:start position:0%
that you have the right and expectation
 
04:22:46.510 --> 04:22:46.520 align:start position:0%
that academic curriculum taught in your
 
04:22:49.189 --> 04:22:49.199 align:start position:0%
child School align with state with New
 
04:22:52.070 --> 04:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and federal law
 
04:22:54.990 --> 04:22:55.000 align:start position:0%
well we're really lucky because New
 
04:22:57.550 --> 04:22:57.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire public schools are some of the
 
04:22:59.309 --> 04:22:59.319 align:start position:0%
best in the country and our students
 
04:23:01.870 --> 04:23:01.880 align:start position:0%
perform among the best in the country
 
04:23:04.269 --> 04:23:04.279 align:start position:0%
and it's because of that local control
 
04:23:07.830 --> 04:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
local curriculum and and and high
 
04:23:10.229 --> 04:23:10.239 align:start position:0%
expectations that our voters in every
 
04:23:12.790 --> 04:23:12.800 align:start position:0%
District in the state have and why do we
 
04:23:15.229 --> 04:23:15.239 align:start position:0%
know that to be the case because every
 
04:23:18.269 --> 04:23:18.279 align:start position:0%
year they open up their pocketbooks and
 
04:23:20.149 --> 04:23:20.159 align:start position:0%
and fund their school districts because
 
04:23:22.189 --> 04:23:22.199 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire doesn't fund
 
04:23:25.389 --> 04:23:25.399 align:start position:0%
them voters have high expectations for
 
04:23:27.670 --> 04:23:27.680 align:start position:0%
our schools and high expectations for
 
04:23:29.870 --> 04:23:29.880 align:start position:0%
students I'm concerned that these two
 
04:23:33.550 --> 04:23:33.560 align:start position:0%
lines will change that so um appreciate
 
04:23:33.560 --> 04:23:34.830 align:start position:0%
lines will change that so um appreciate
your

04:23:34.830 --> 04:23:34.840 align:start position:0%
your
 
04:23:36.790 --> 04:23:36.800 align:start position:0%
consideration any questions for
 
04:23:36.800 --> 04:23:38.590 align:start position:0%
consideration any questions for
representative

04:23:38.590 --> 04:23:38.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:23:41.469 --> 04:23:41.479 align:start position:0%
luno representative Raymond uh thank you
 
04:23:42.950 --> 04:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thank you representative
 
04:23:45.389 --> 04:23:45.399 align:start position:0%
luno so I just want to make sure I
 
04:23:47.710 --> 04:23:47.720 align:start position:0%
understand your testimony are you
 
04:23:53.070 --> 04:23:53.080 align:start position:0%
concerned that this line C on uh line 36
 
04:23:56.630 --> 04:23:56.640 align:start position:0%
will override local control of the
 
04:23:59.510 --> 04:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
standards and end up in a situation
 
04:24:01.070 --> 04:24:01.080 align:start position:0%
where the state is now determining it
 
04:24:03.030 --> 04:24:03.040 align:start position:0%
instead of the local school boards I I
 
04:24:05.750 --> 04:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
am concerned um concerned about that and
 
04:24:08.030 --> 04:24:08.040 align:start position:0%
especially when um when nearly every
 
04:24:12.030 --> 04:24:12.040 align:start position:0%
school in the state is um um you know is
 
04:24:15.309 --> 04:24:15.319 align:start position:0%
is utilizing academic curriculum that uh
 
04:24:17.630 --> 04:24:17.640 align:start position:0%
that that is is upto-date
 
04:24:20.030 --> 04:24:20.040 align:start position:0%
effective and puts our students in a in
 
04:24:21.670 --> 04:24:21.680 align:start position:0%
a position where they're where they're
 
04:24:23.309 --> 04:24:23.319 align:start position:0%
competitive not just nationally but
 
04:24:25.630 --> 04:24:25.640 align:start position:0%
globally and uh and and this is
 
04:24:27.349 --> 04:24:27.359 align:start position:0%
important this is why our students do so
 
04:24:30.830 --> 04:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
well um I'm just concerned that um that
 
04:24:33.389 --> 04:24:33.399 align:start position:0%
that having the expectation that um that
 
04:24:35.790 --> 04:24:35.800 align:start position:0%
the curriculum taught in your child
 
04:24:38.630 --> 04:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
schools aligns with with these low
 
04:24:41.429 --> 04:24:41.439 align:start position:0%
standards um uh adopted recently by the
 
04:24:43.349 --> 04:24:43.359 align:start position:0%
state are just going to uh hurt our
 
04:24:48.269 --> 04:24:48.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:51.590 --> 04:24:51.600 align:start position:0%

04:25:15.030 --> 04:25:15.040 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Representatives my name
 
04:25:17.269 --> 04:25:17.279 align:start position:0%
is Zoe Hill I am a resident of Lebanon
 
04:25:19.309 --> 04:25:19.319 align:start position:0%

04:25:19.319 --> 04:25:20.109 align:start position:0%
and I am here to testify in opposition
to

04:25:20.109 --> 04:25:20.119 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:25:23.630 --> 04:25:23.640 align:start position:0%
hb10 if passed this bill will take away
 
04:25:26.389 --> 04:25:26.399 align:start position:0%
safe spaces for for children outside the
 
04:25:31.590 --> 04:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
home sadly some children's homes are not
 
04:25:34.670 --> 04:25:34.680 align:start position:0%
safe and that is why it is so important
 
04:25:36.790 --> 04:25:36.800 align:start position:0%
for these spaces to exist outside the
 
04:25:40.830 --> 04:25:40.840 align:start position:0%
home like in schools and in
 
04:25:43.670 --> 04:25:43.680 align:start position:0%
hospitals and when children do not have
 
04:25:45.910 --> 04:25:45.920 align:start position:0%
people to talk to about their mental
 
04:25:49.670 --> 04:25:49.680 align:start position:0%
health and their feelings and anything
 
04:25:52.550 --> 04:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
that they are facing their mental health
 
04:25:54.389 --> 04:25:54.399 align:start position:0%
can deteriorate even leading to the
 
04:25:57.830 --> 04:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
point of self harm and ending their own
 
04:26:00.990 --> 04:26:01.000 align:start position:0%
lives a vote inexpedient to legislate is
 
04:26:03.349 --> 04:26:03.359 align:start position:0%
a vote for children's mental health

04:26:55.389 --> 04:26:55.399 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking the time to hear
 
04:26:57.269 --> 04:26:57.279 align:start position:0%
public comments on this bill today my
 
04:26:59.189 --> 04:26:59.199 align:start position:0%
name is Sarah Terell I'm a lifelong
 
04:27:01.469 --> 04:27:01.479 align:start position:0%
resident of New Hampshire and the proud
 
04:27:03.990 --> 04:27:04.000 align:start position:0%
parent of two wonderful children my son
 
04:27:05.910 --> 04:27:05.920 align:start position:0%
is 18 and thriving in his first year of
 
04:27:07.790 --> 04:27:07.800 align:start position:0%
college my daughter is 16 and a
 
04:27:10.389 --> 04:27:10.399 align:start position:0%
dedicated High School sophomore I'm here
 
04:27:12.269 --> 04:27:12.279 align:start position:0%
today because I have serious concerns
 
04:27:13.870 --> 04:27:13.880 align:start position:0%
about this so-called parental Bill of
 
04:27:16.109 --> 04:27:16.119 align:start position:0%
Rights at its core this bill assumes
 
04:27:18.469 --> 04:27:18.479 align:start position:0%
that parents in schools are at odds that
 
04:27:20.309 --> 04:27:20.319 align:start position:0%
they require government micromanagement
 
04:27:22.269 --> 04:27:22.279 align:start position:0%
to work together effectively but that
 
04:27:24.790 --> 04:27:24.800 align:start position:0%
simply isn't true parents and Educators
 
04:27:27.030 --> 04:27:27.040 align:start position:0%
already collaborate every day to support
 
04:27:28.830 --> 04:27:28.840 align:start position:0%
children's learning and wellbeing this
 
04:27:31.229 --> 04:27:31.239 align:start position:0%
bill does not strength strengthen those
 
04:27:33.750 --> 04:27:33.760 align:start position:0%
relationships it undermines them more
 
04:27:35.550 --> 04:27:35.560 align:start position:0%
specifically I'm deeply troubled by the
 
04:27:37.189 --> 04:27:37.199 align:start position:0%
provisions that could force schools to
 
04:27:39.870 --> 04:27:39.880 align:start position:0%
disclose a student's lgbtq identity
 
04:27:41.750 --> 04:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
before they are ready when my daughter
 
04:27:43.670 --> 04:27:43.680 align:start position:0%
came out to me it was in a moment of
 
04:27:45.750 --> 04:27:45.760 align:start position:0%
immense trust and vulnerability I could
 
04:27:48.429 --> 04:27:48.439 align:start position:0%
see the anxiety on her face even though
 
04:27:50.189 --> 04:27:50.199 align:start position:0%
she had no reason to doubt our love she
 
04:27:51.910 --> 04:27:51.920 align:start position:0%
was still afraid of how her father and I
 
04:27:54.149 --> 04:27:54.159 align:start position:0%
might react that moment belonged to her
 
04:27:56.510 --> 04:27:56.520 align:start position:0%
to our family if someone at her school
 
04:27:58.269 --> 04:27:58.279 align:start position:0%
had taken that decision away from her I
 
04:28:00.349 --> 04:28:00.359 align:start position:0%
would have been devastated no one
 
04:28:01.990 --> 04:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
especially a child should be forced to
 
04:28:03.870 --> 04:28:03.880 align:start position:0%
reveal something so personal before they
 
04:28:06.910 --> 04:28:06.920 align:start position:0%
are ready this bill claims to protect
 
04:28:09.389 --> 04:28:09.399 align:start position:0%
parental rights but at what cost it
 
04:28:11.309 --> 04:28:11.319 align:start position:0%
disregards the rights and dignity of the
 
04:28:13.309 --> 04:28:13.319 align:start position:0%
very children it claim claims to serve
 
04:28:14.870 --> 04:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
not all students are lucky enough to
 
04:28:16.870 --> 04:28:16.880 align:start position:0%
have supportive families for some being
 
04:28:18.710 --> 04:28:18.720 align:start position:0%
outed could mean rejection homelessness
 
04:28:20.990 --> 04:28:21.000 align:start position:0%
or even danger the government should not
 
04:28:22.750 --> 04:28:22.760 align:start position:0%
be in the business of putting vulnerable
 
04:28:25.309 --> 04:28:25.319 align:start position:0%
Children at Risk I urge you to listen to
 
04:28:26.790 --> 04:28:26.800 align:start position:0%
the voices of parents teachers and
 
04:28:28.309 --> 04:28:28.319 align:start position:0%
students who know firsthand that
 
04:28:30.429 --> 04:28:30.439 align:start position:0%
collaboration not government overreach
 
04:28:32.590 --> 04:28:32.600 align:start position:0%
is what truly benefits children this
 
04:28:34.469 --> 04:28:34.479 align:start position:0%
bill is unnecessary harmful and
 
04:28:39.189 --> 04:28:39.199 align:start position:0%
dangerous please vote itl on hb10 thank

04:29:07.790 --> 04:29:07.800 align:start position:0%
Harrington hi thank you for allowing me
 
04:29:09.229 --> 04:29:09.239 align:start position:0%
the time my name is Betsy Harrington
 
04:29:11.349 --> 04:29:11.359 align:start position:0%
from Dearing I'm the parent that you
 
04:29:13.149 --> 04:29:13.159 align:start position:0%
guys are talking about I'm the one with
 
04:29:16.109 --> 04:29:16.119 align:start position:0%
kids in high school who wants the right
 
04:29:17.950 --> 04:29:17.960 align:start position:0%
to know what's going on I'm the one who
 
04:29:20.229 --> 04:29:20.239 align:start position:0%
looks at their curriculum and decides
 
04:29:23.710 --> 04:29:23.720 align:start position:0%
what they can and don't do and so just
 
04:29:25.790 --> 04:29:25.800 align:start position:0%
this year I have one teacher that really
 
04:29:27.870 --> 04:29:27.880 align:start position:0%
likes to cross my boundaries on the
 
04:29:30.990 --> 04:29:31.000 align:start position:0%
regular um and I try to respect her
 
04:29:34.309 --> 04:29:34.319 align:start position:0%
vision and uh my vision of what kind of
 
04:29:38.030 --> 04:29:38.040 align:start position:0%
education my child's receiving um so I
 
04:29:40.309 --> 04:29:40.319 align:start position:0%
respectfully told her this year um
 
04:29:42.149 --> 04:29:42.159 align:start position:0%
there's something called rated books.
 
04:29:44.070 --> 04:29:44.080 align:start position:0%
org it's an organization that rates
 
04:29:47.630 --> 04:29:47.640 align:start position:0%
books for uh inap age inappropriateness
 
04:29:49.830 --> 04:29:49.840 align:start position:0%
and so she was sort of acting like she
 
04:29:51.269 --> 04:29:51.279 align:start position:0%
couldn't get along with me because I
 
04:29:53.630 --> 04:29:53.640 align:start position:0%
wasn't going to approve books that she
 
04:29:55.990 --> 04:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
was uh giving the kids and I said oh
 
04:29:57.790 --> 04:29:57.800 align:start position:0%
just go to rate books.org and if it's
 
04:30:00.910 --> 04:30:00.920 align:start position:0%
rated four or five it's a no and just
 
04:30:02.790 --> 04:30:02.800 align:start position:0%
respectfully it's a no I appreciate you
 
04:30:05.630 --> 04:30:05.640 align:start position:0%
checking and and that's it I haven't had
 
04:30:07.149 --> 04:30:07.159 align:start position:0%
to talk to her again about it because I
 
04:30:09.510 --> 04:30:09.520 align:start position:0%
just set a boundary and that's it I want
 
04:30:11.269 --> 04:30:11.279 align:start position:0%
to be able to set boundaries I want to
 
04:30:13.389 --> 04:30:13.399 align:start position:0%
be able to see what the curriculum is my
 
04:30:15.469 --> 04:30:15.479 align:start position:0%
kids are the top of their classes and
 
04:30:17.070 --> 04:30:17.080 align:start position:0%
it's for a reason it's because I'm a
 
04:30:19.269 --> 04:30:19.279 align:start position:0%
good parent and I'm in tune with what's
 
04:30:22.389 --> 04:30:22.399 align:start position:0%
happening if I also worked for DCF I
 
04:30:24.349 --> 04:30:24.359 align:start position:0%
worked at the prison for 10 years as a
 
04:30:26.790 --> 04:30:26.800 align:start position:0%
sex offender counselor for five of those
 
04:30:29.269 --> 04:30:29.279 align:start position:0%
and I feel like having been a therapist
 
04:30:32.309 --> 04:30:32.319 align:start position:0%
a mom all these roles that I can say
 
04:30:34.870 --> 04:30:34.880 align:start position:0%
that this bill is necessary I support it
 
04:30:38.269 --> 04:30:38.279 align:start position:0%
and it's necessary good parents need to
 
04:30:40.670 --> 04:30:40.680 align:start position:0%
have a right to be good parents and
 
04:30:42.429 --> 04:30:42.439 align:start position:0%
you're taking away from them we already
 
04:30:44.910 --> 04:30:44.920 align:start position:0%
have a way of dealing with bad parents I
 
04:30:46.870 --> 04:30:46.880 align:start position:0%
worked at DCF and I know what it was
 
04:30:49.389 --> 04:30:49.399 align:start position:0%
like and we dealt with bad
 
04:30:51.950 --> 04:30:51.960 align:start position:0%
parents people called us schools called
 
04:30:54.109 --> 04:30:54.119 align:start position:0%
us and we already have something in
 
04:30:56.950 --> 04:30:56.960 align:start position:0%
place we need
 
04:31:00.149 --> 04:31:00.159 align:start position:0%
these all of these amendments here and
 
04:31:01.590 --> 04:31:01.600 align:start position:0%
because I read the whole thing again
 
04:31:02.950 --> 04:31:02.960 align:start position:0%
it's a little different than it was to
 
04:31:05.309 --> 04:31:05.319 align:start position:0%
start with but we still need all of
 
04:31:08.269 --> 04:31:08.279 align:start position:0%
these I I'm pretty support I I could see
 
04:31:11.469 --> 04:31:11.479 align:start position:0%
that changing a word from a to to the
 
04:31:13.990 --> 04:31:14.000 align:start position:0%
might help help but otherwise I'm
 
04:31:16.309 --> 04:31:16.319 align:start position:0%
overall really supportive of this bill
 
04:31:18.189 --> 04:31:18.199 align:start position:0%
I'm the parent you're talking about and
 
04:31:21.590 --> 04:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
please consider my thoughts of how I
 
04:31:24.710 --> 04:31:24.720 align:start position:0%
might raise my kids thank you
 
04:31:24.720 --> 04:31:26.349 align:start position:0%
might raise my kids thank you
representative

04:31:26.349 --> 04:31:26.359 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:31:28.750 --> 04:31:28.760 align:start position:0%
Petrino thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
04:31:31.070 --> 04:31:31.080 align:start position:0%
you for sharing uh your story I
 
04:31:34.710 --> 04:31:34.720 align:start position:0%
appreciate that so I'm just curious as
 
04:31:36.670 --> 04:31:36.680 align:start position:0%
to whether or not you would denied the
 
04:31:40.309 --> 04:31:40.319 align:start position:0%
opportunity to uh review the materials
 
04:31:44.070 --> 04:31:44.080 align:start position:0%
uh in question um and um if you were
 
04:31:46.269 --> 04:31:46.279 align:start position:0%
denied the opportunity to have your
 
04:31:50.349 --> 04:31:50.359 align:start position:0%
child opt out of uh those experiences
 
04:31:53.070 --> 04:31:53.080 align:start position:0%
and and and lastly uh if that's the case
 
04:31:55.189 --> 04:31:55.199 align:start position:0%
did you talk to the administration and
 
04:31:57.510 --> 04:31:57.520 align:start position:0%
say hey look my parental rights have
 
04:31:59.469 --> 04:31:59.479 align:start position:0%
been violated here I don't want my kid
 
04:32:02.070 --> 04:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
to have access to these materials so
 
04:32:03.910 --> 04:32:03.920 align:start position:0%
when I went to the school to talk about
 
04:32:06.469 --> 04:32:06.479 align:start position:0%
the books that I felt were inappropriate
 
04:32:08.389 --> 04:32:08.399 align:start position:0%
the school's response was we had no
 
04:32:10.429 --> 04:32:10.439 align:start position:0%
challenge policy at that time it's since
 
04:32:12.630 --> 04:32:12.640 align:start position:0%
changed based on my complaint but at the
 
04:32:13.790 --> 04:32:13.800 align:start position:0%
time there was no way for me to
 
04:32:15.309 --> 04:32:15.319 align:start position:0%
challenge a book I could only go to the
 
04:32:17.429 --> 04:32:17.439 align:start position:0%
school board and say hey I have you know
 
04:32:19.389 --> 04:32:19.399 align:start position:0%
issues with these books being available
 
04:32:21.229 --> 04:32:21.239 align:start position:0%
they banned my children this was three
 
04:32:24.030 --> 04:32:24.040 align:start position:0%
years ago my oldest is about to graduate
 
04:32:25.510 --> 04:32:25.520 align:start position:0%
they banned my children from all
 
04:32:27.070 --> 04:32:27.080 align:start position:0%
libraries that day and my kids have
 
04:32:28.910 --> 04:32:28.920 align:start position:0%
never used School libraries ever they've
 
04:32:32.109 --> 04:32:32.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:34.510 --> 04:32:34.520 align:start position:0%
allowed thank you you may be uh
 
04:32:38.109 --> 04:32:38.119 align:start position:0%
absolutely right um my understanding is
 
04:32:40.469 --> 04:32:40.479 align:start position:0%
that uh the parental right to opt
 
04:32:42.030 --> 04:32:42.040 align:start position:0%
children out of certain School
 
04:32:45.070 --> 04:32:45.080 align:start position:0%
experiences already exists and if that's
 
04:32:47.349 --> 04:32:47.359 align:start position:0%
the case in your instance then I would
 
04:32:48.950 --> 04:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
suggest that your rights were in fact
 
04:32:51.309 --> 04:32:51.319 align:start position:0%
violated and the school district had to
 
04:32:53.910 --> 04:32:53.920 align:start position:0%
uh address your concerns so that's where
 
04:32:55.630 --> 04:32:55.640 align:start position:0%
I'm a little bit confused because my
 
04:32:58.229 --> 04:32:58.239 align:start position:0%
understanding is the parental right to
 
04:33:00.189 --> 04:33:00.199 align:start position:0%
opt their child out of something they
 
04:33:02.229 --> 04:33:02.239 align:start position:0%
believe to be questionable already
 
04:33:05.150 --> 04:33:05.160 align:start position:0%
exists the parental right to uh have
 
04:33:07.310 --> 04:33:07.320 align:start position:0%
children have access to certain uh
 
04:33:09.830 --> 04:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
materials at school already exists and
 
04:33:12.029 --> 04:33:12.039 align:start position:0%
if and if that was not your experience
 
04:33:13.670 --> 04:33:13.680 align:start position:0%
and I would suggest that your rights
 
04:33:15.269 --> 04:33:15.279 align:start position:0%
were violated and the school district
 
04:33:17.470 --> 04:33:17.480 align:start position:0%
was an error I feel like my rights have
 
04:33:19.789 --> 04:33:19.799 align:start position:0%
been violated another example is like
 
04:33:21.670 --> 04:33:21.680 align:start position:0%
the survey that they give to all the
 
04:33:24.230 --> 04:33:24.240 align:start position:0%
students every two years I opted out of
 
04:33:27.029 --> 04:33:27.039 align:start position:0%
that they still gave that to my kids now
 
04:33:29.310 --> 04:33:29.320 align:start position:0%
my kids refused and they still tried and
 
04:33:31.709 --> 04:33:31.719 align:start position:0%
pushed and tried to give that to my kids
 
04:33:33.029 --> 04:33:33.039 align:start position:0%
and when the girlfriend of one of my
 
04:33:35.070 --> 04:33:35.080 align:start position:0%
kids came home that day to our house
 
04:33:36.910 --> 04:33:36.920 align:start position:0%
that day for dinner I said how was it
 
04:33:39.551 --> 04:33:39.561 align:start position:0%
and she said it was traumatizing and
 
04:33:42.869 --> 04:33:42.879 align:start position:0%
triggering so I was happy my kids stood
 
04:33:45.070 --> 04:33:45.080 align:start position:0%
their ground and refused but they still
 
04:33:47.029 --> 04:33:47.039 align:start position:0%
tried to give that to my kids and they
 
04:33:48.470 --> 04:33:48.480 align:start position:0%
still try to give my kids age
 
04:33:50.429 --> 04:33:50.439 align:start position:0%
inappropriate stuff I just keep setting
 
04:33:52.230 --> 04:33:52.240 align:start position:0%
boundaries do they show me all the
 
04:33:54.109 --> 04:33:54.119 align:start position:0%
curriculum no I don't get to see
 
04:33:56.189 --> 04:33:56.199 align:start position:0%
everything but I try to see whatever
 
04:33:58.390 --> 04:33:58.400 align:start position:0%
they will let me see I do think that
 
04:34:00.551 --> 04:34:00.561 align:start position:0%
this is
 
04:34:02.789 --> 04:34:02.799 align:start position:0%
necessary F yes followup please thank
 
04:34:03.990 --> 04:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and just one last
 
04:34:06.830 --> 04:34:06.840 align:start position:0%
followup on that so if the parental
 
04:34:10.390 --> 04:34:10.400 align:start position:0%
rights that we spoke of already exist um
 
04:34:12.269 --> 04:34:12.279 align:start position:0%
such as the right to opt out of certain
 
04:34:14.551 --> 04:34:14.561 align:start position:0%
materials at school and your rights were
 
04:34:17.709 --> 04:34:17.719 align:start position:0%
violated as we've acknowledged then how
 
04:34:20.429 --> 04:34:20.439 align:start position:0%
would restating those rights again in
 
04:34:22.629 --> 04:34:22.639 align:start position:0%
this legislation take care of the
 
04:34:24.670 --> 04:34:24.680 align:start position:0%
problem that you experienced because in
 
04:34:26.470 --> 04:34:26.480 align:start position:0%
either instance your rights were
 
04:34:29.510 --> 04:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
violated so how going to prevent secrets
 
04:34:31.629 --> 04:34:31.639 align:start position:0%
to me and for me when I look at this
 
04:34:33.510 --> 04:34:33.520 align:start position:0%
whole thing it's going to pres prevent
 
04:34:36.429 --> 04:34:36.439 align:start position:0%
secrets and as a therapist I've been a
 
04:34:38.949 --> 04:34:38.959 align:start position:0%
therapist I'm not one now I I really
 
04:34:40.429 --> 04:34:40.439 align:start position:0%
think that that's dangerous I think the
 
04:34:43.029 --> 04:34:43.039 align:start position:0%
parent child relationship more important
 
04:34:45.269 --> 04:34:45.279 align:start position:0%
than any other relationship and that's
 
04:34:48.150 --> 04:34:48.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:51.470 --> 04:34:51.480 align:start position:0%
prioritize representative Nelson thank
 
04:34:53.830 --> 04:34:53.840 align:start position:0%

04:34:56.230 --> 04:34:56.240 align:start position:0%

saying I'm an assertive person you're an
 
04:35:01.869 --> 04:35:01.879 align:start position:0%

your children I I try to do the same my
 
04:35:07.551 --> 04:35:07.561 align:start position:0%
question is do you feel like there are
 
04:35:09.750 --> 04:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
um many parents who are not as assertive
 
04:35:12.070 --> 04:35:12.080 align:start position:0%
as we are or who are comfortable being
 
04:35:14.070 --> 04:35:14.080 align:start position:0%
as assertive as we are when it comes to
 
04:35:14.080 --> 04:35:17.230 align:start position:0%
as assertive as we are when it comes to
school

04:35:17.230 --> 04:35:17.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:19.750 --> 04:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
matters sure some are not as comfortable
 
04:35:19.760 --> 04:35:20.869 align:start position:0%
matters sure some are not as comfortable
as

04:35:20.869 --> 04:35:20.879 align:start position:0%

04:35:29.470 --> 04:35:29.480 align:start position:0%
followup do you feel like this framework
 
04:35:31.390 --> 04:35:31.400 align:start position:0%
of an actual parental Bill of Rights
 
04:35:34.429 --> 04:35:34.439 align:start position:0%
might um be very helpful for parents who
 
04:35:37.070 --> 04:35:37.080 align:start position:0%
are not as confident or assertive as we
 
04:35:39.910 --> 04:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
may be absolutely people reach out to me
 
04:35:42.390 --> 04:35:42.400 align:start position:0%
all the time and ask me for help because
 
04:35:44.150 --> 04:35:44.160 align:start position:0%

Pastor I know you
 
04:36:18.029 --> 04:36:18.039 align:start position:0%
did oh there it is it was on my glasses
 
04:36:21.189 --> 04:36:21.199 align:start position:0%
that's why I couldn't
 
04:36:24.910 --> 04:36:24.920 align:start position:0%
sorry um so I'm I'm uh speaking on
 
04:36:27.070 --> 04:36:27.080 align:start position:0%
behalf of supporting the bill and all
 
04:36:29.590 --> 04:36:29.600 align:start position:0%
the sponsors who support it I started
 
04:36:31.470 --> 04:36:31.480 align:start position:0%
off about 20 years ago as a father's
 
04:36:32.869 --> 04:36:32.879 align:start position:0%
rights Advocate that's when I probably
 
04:36:37.189 --> 04:36:37.199 align:start position:0%
met Deb D Simone and um that
 
04:36:39.470 --> 04:36:39.480 align:start position:0%
expanded when I started to see the other
 
04:36:42.390 --> 04:36:42.400 align:start position:0%
side of the coin I saw Ms and I saw
 
04:36:45.310 --> 04:36:45.320 align:start position:0%
grandparents affected greatly by Family
 
04:36:47.750 --> 04:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
Law and grandparents especially are
 
04:36:50.109 --> 04:36:50.119 align:start position:0%
important to me especially as I age
 
04:36:53.269 --> 04:36:53.279 align:start position:0%
myself um and now we've come to a
 
04:36:56.789 --> 04:36:56.799 align:start position:0%
different topic about the same targeted
 
04:37:01.150 --> 04:37:01.160 align:start position:0%
people which is kind of sad in a way um
 
04:37:03.910 --> 04:37:03.920 align:start position:0%
but I definitely support the intent of
 
04:37:07.990 --> 04:37:08.000 align:start position:0%
the bill I support your changes that you
 
04:37:10.869 --> 04:37:10.879 align:start position:0%
need to be made given everyone who's
 
04:37:12.910 --> 04:37:12.920 align:start position:0%
spoken before for me and I think you're
 
04:37:15.470 --> 04:37:15.480 align:start position:0%
doing the right thing by instituting it
 
04:37:18.590 --> 04:37:18.600 align:start position:0%
as a law because we've come to that
 
04:37:21.551 --> 04:37:21.561 align:start position:0%
place where we have to
 
04:37:24.150 --> 04:37:24.160 align:start position:0%
decide who gets the decision of the
 
04:37:26.349 --> 04:37:26.359 align:start position:0%
child who's who's going to be deciding
 
04:37:29.390 --> 04:37:29.400 align:start position:0%
for them when I was a child when I was
 
04:37:31.670 --> 04:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
um advocating for children I I saw
 
04:37:35.910 --> 04:37:35.920 align:start position:0%
clearly that a lot of them were um
 
04:37:39.189 --> 04:37:39.199 align:start position:0%
um were basically ruled by their parents
 
04:37:40.670 --> 04:37:40.680 align:start position:0%
and whether or not we liked what the
 
04:37:43.109 --> 04:37:43.119 align:start position:0%
parents did other than violence and you
 
04:37:45.429 --> 04:37:45.439 align:start position:0%
we have to support them but it's come to
 
04:37:47.189 --> 04:37:47.199 align:start position:0%
a point now where it's getting a little
 
04:37:50.830 --> 04:37:50.840 align:start position:0%
bit out of hand and uh I'm going into
 
04:37:53.510 --> 04:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
bathrooms that don't say the gender
 
04:37:56.189 --> 04:37:56.199 align:start position:0%
anymore so I'm a little worried
 
04:37:58.910 --> 04:37:58.920 align:start position:0%
myself and so I speak on behalf of this
 
04:38:01.429 --> 04:38:01.439 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I'm open to any questions
 
04:38:02.910 --> 04:38:02.920 align:start position:0%
and I'm hoping I'm short enough that
 
04:38:06.310 --> 04:38:06.320 align:start position:0%
I'll get my excess time for the next
 
04:38:10.789 --> 04:38:10.799 align:start position:0%
bill I keep a log um any questions for
 
04:38:10.799 --> 04:38:12.109 align:start position:0%
bill I keep a log um any questions for
the

04:38:12.109 --> 04:38:12.119 align:start position:0%

04:38:15.230 --> 04:38:15.240 align:start position:0%
gentlemen seeing none thank you you got
 
04:38:17.189 --> 04:38:17.199 align:start position:0%

04:38:21.830 --> 04:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
you chair recognizes Karen leot Hill do
 
04:38:25.869 --> 04:38:25.879 align:start position:0%
I have that right yes Ken Leo Hill I'm
 
04:38:29.269 --> 04:38:29.279 align:start position:0%
sorry Lee the te is a little sneaky
 
04:38:31.150 --> 04:38:31.160 align:start position:0%
because it's silent so it's Karen Leo
 
04:38:34.709 --> 04:38:34.719 align:start position:0%
Hill okay did you have a relative in the
 
04:38:37.709 --> 04:38:37.719 align:start position:0%
house at one point with that last that I
 
04:38:39.709 --> 04:38:39.719 align:start position:0%
did not but I I'm a 20-year City
 
04:38:41.429 --> 04:38:41.439 align:start position:0%
councelor and the former mayor of

Lebanon and so I have testified in this
 
04:38:45.789 --> 04:38:45.799 align:start position:0%
body I wasn't asking your experience I
 
04:38:50.029 --> 04:38:50.039 align:start position:0%

04:38:55.390 --> 04:38:55.400 align:start position:0%
Representatives Mr chairman thank you
 
04:38:56.949 --> 04:38:56.959 align:start position:0%
very much for allowing me to testify
 
04:39:01.709 --> 04:39:01.719 align:start position:0%
before you today I am here as a well I
 
04:39:03.750 --> 04:39:03.760 align:start position:0%
am here as the executive counselor
 
04:39:06.189 --> 04:39:06.199 align:start position:0%
representing District 2 81 cities and
 
04:39:08.670 --> 04:39:08.680 align:start position:0%
towns in Western New Hampshire including
 
04:39:10.150 --> 04:39:10.160 align:start position:0%
the Capital
 
04:39:12.869 --> 04:39:12.879 align:start position:0%
Area I understand that the intention of
 
04:39:15.990 --> 04:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
this bill it seems is to compile and
 
04:39:18.029 --> 04:39:18.039 align:start position:0%
assemble all of the references to
 
04:39:20.150 --> 04:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
parental rights into one place to make
 
04:39:22.390 --> 04:39:22.400 align:start position:0%
it easier for parents to understand
 
04:39:24.310 --> 04:39:24.320 align:start position:0%
their rights and I can understand that
 
04:39:25.990 --> 04:39:26.000 align:start position:0%
that is a good
 
04:39:29.070 --> 04:39:29.080 align:start position:0%
intention I do believe that there are
 
04:39:32.230 --> 04:39:32.240 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences in this bill
 
04:39:34.869 --> 04:39:34.879 align:start position:0%
that make it harmful I believe that some
 
04:39:37.270 --> 04:39:37.280 align:start position:0%
of the language is vague that would make
 
04:39:39.708 --> 04:39:39.718 align:start position:0%
it difficult to enforce and I believe
 
04:39:41.390 --> 04:39:41.400 align:start position:0%
that based on all of these reasons
 
04:39:42.830 --> 04:39:42.840 align:start position:0%
including the testimony of others
 
04:39:45.470 --> 04:39:45.480 align:start position:0%
offered before me today I ask that you
 
04:39:47.590 --> 04:39:47.600 align:start position:0%
consider voting inexpedient to legislate
 
04:39:49.270 --> 04:39:49.280 align:start position:0%
on this
 
04:39:52.590 --> 04:39:52.600 align:start position:0%
bill with regard to um
 
04:39:56.350 --> 04:39:56.360 align:start position:0%
vague with regard to vagueness one is
 
04:39:57.788 --> 04:39:57.798 align:start position:0%
that's been discussed earlier is the
 
04:39:59.830 --> 04:39:59.840 align:start position:0%
definition of parent and whether that
 
04:40:01.830 --> 04:40:01.840 align:start position:0%
could introduce whether the parent is
 
04:40:04.390 --> 04:40:04.400 align:start position:0%
specifically the parent of a minor child
 
04:40:07.550 --> 04:40:07.560 align:start position:0%
in a school um or whether this could
 
04:40:12.150 --> 04:40:12.160 align:start position:0%
introduce uh potential challenges or um
 
04:40:14.628 --> 04:40:14.638 align:start position:0%
uh interference by parents who happen to
 
04:40:16.230 --> 04:40:16.240 align:start position:0%
have minor children but are not involved
 
04:40:18.788 --> 04:40:18.798 align:start position:0%
in a school there's some uh there's some
 
04:40:21.750 --> 04:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
vagueness there that could be
 
04:40:24.628 --> 04:40:24.638 align:start position:0%
challenging to enforce there's also the
 
04:40:27.070 --> 04:40:27.080 align:start position:0%
word morality which is referenced and
 
04:40:30.150 --> 04:40:30.160 align:start position:0%
does not have an attendant definition
 
04:40:34.190 --> 04:40:34.200 align:start position:0%
the word sex is also referenced um and I
 
04:40:36.070 --> 04:40:36.080 align:start position:0%
can point you to the place it's on page
 
04:40:38.310 --> 04:40:38.320 align:start position:0%
three line 27 this is where the word
 
04:40:41.990 --> 04:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
morality and the word sex appear a few
 
04:40:43.788 --> 04:40:43.798 align:start position:0%
lines above it the word discipline
 
04:40:46.948 --> 04:40:46.958 align:start position:0%
appears on page three line 23 the word
 
04:40:48.990 --> 04:40:49.000 align:start position:0%
discipline is also not defined in this
 
04:40:51.310 --> 04:40:51.320 align:start position:0%
statute uh the mention the word morality
 
04:40:53.750 --> 04:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
is not defined the word sex is also not
 
04:40:55.990 --> 04:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
defined there's a lot of discussions
 
04:40:59.510 --> 04:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
about what sex is and I think if it
 
04:41:01.310 --> 04:41:01.320 align:start position:0%
appears it should probably defi be
 
04:41:03.670 --> 04:41:03.680 align:start position:0%
defined somewhere otherwise it's
 
04:41:06.390 --> 04:41:06.400 align:start position:0%
potentially ambiguous and could lead to
 
04:41:09.110 --> 04:41:09.120 align:start position:0%
um questions about
 
04:41:11.590 --> 04:41:11.600 align:start position:0%
enforcement we've heard from theic
 
04:41:14.310 --> 04:41:14.320 align:start position:0%
Society about the barrier to care that
 
04:41:16.830 --> 04:41:16.840 align:start position:0%
this bill could potentially present it
 
04:41:18.990 --> 04:41:19.000 align:start position:0%
certainly is I think an unintended
 
04:41:20.670 --> 04:41:20.680 align:start position:0%
consequence on those bringing forth the
 
04:41:23.430 --> 04:41:23.440 align:start position:0%
bill I don't believe that they intend to
 
04:41:26.190 --> 04:41:26.200 align:start position:0%
create a barrier to patients to miners
 
04:41:27.830 --> 04:41:27.840 align:start position:0%
who are seeking medical attention
 
04:41:31.350 --> 04:41:31.360 align:start position:0%
nevertheless we did hear testimony from
 
04:41:33.270 --> 04:41:33.280 align:start position:0%
trusted providers that this could create
 
04:41:35.830 --> 04:41:35.840 align:start position:0%
an unintentional barrier to care we've
 
04:41:38.350 --> 04:41:38.360 align:start position:0%
also heard testimony that it could have
 
04:41:40.910 --> 04:41:40.920 align:start position:0%
a chilling effect on safe spaces and the
 
04:41:43.910 --> 04:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
ability of teachers to um to teach
 
04:41:46.470 --> 04:41:46.480 align:start position:0%
children in their
 
04:41:48.788 --> 04:41:48.798 align:start position:0%
custody as someone who experienced
 
04:41:51.430 --> 04:41:51.440 align:start position:0%
violence in the home as a child I'm here
 
04:41:53.628 --> 04:41:53.638 align:start position:0%
to testify firsthand about the
 
04:41:56.868 --> 04:41:56.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:00.150 --> 04:42:00.160 align:start position:0%
spaces for all of these reasons and more
 
04:42:01.868 --> 04:42:01.878 align:start position:0%
I would encourage you to vote
 
04:42:04.510 --> 04:42:04.520 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate on this bill if
 
04:42:07.470 --> 04:42:07.480 align:start position:0%
it is worth doing it's worth doing right
 
04:42:09.550 --> 04:42:09.560 align:start position:0%
and I would suggest that this bill could
 
04:42:12.670 --> 04:42:12.680 align:start position:0%
use some more work um before bringing it
 
04:42:15.350 --> 04:42:15.360 align:start position:0%
to a a vote thank you so much councelor
 
04:42:18.670 --> 04:42:18.680 align:start position:0%
will you take questions I
 
04:42:21.430 --> 04:42:21.440 align:start position:0%
will thank you very much thank
 
04:42:29.230 --> 04:42:29.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:32.270 --> 04:42:32.280 align:start position:0%
gay frequent flyers you know you get to
 
04:42:36.150 --> 04:42:36.160 align:start position:0%
know your people we don't get
 
04:42:38.708 --> 04:42:38.718 align:start position:0%
points thank you very much for allowing
 
04:42:43.350 --> 04:42:43.360 align:start position:0%
me to give my parental uh response I
 
04:42:45.948 --> 04:42:45.958 align:start position:0%
think that this bill needs some more
 
04:42:49.868 --> 04:42:49.878 align:start position:0%
wording adjustments which can be done
 
04:42:54.550 --> 04:42:54.560 align:start position:0%
with uh by continuing it um but I think
 
04:42:56.750 --> 04:42:56.760 align:start position:0%
the what what our previous speaker just
 
04:42:59.310 --> 04:42:59.320 align:start position:0%
pointed out it would be really good to
 
04:43:01.590 --> 04:43:01.600 align:start position:0%
have parental rights in one place
 
04:43:03.270 --> 04:43:03.280 align:start position:0%
because right now it's in covered in
 
04:43:05.628 --> 04:43:05.638 align:start position:0%
many different places in many different
 
04:43:10.270 --> 04:43:10.280 align:start position:0%
bills so uh considering all the inputs
 
04:43:12.470 --> 04:43:12.480 align:start position:0%
that people have come and been concerned
 
04:43:16.230 --> 04:43:16.240 align:start position:0%
about some of which are unfounded
 
04:43:18.550 --> 04:43:18.560 align:start position:0%
because we already have we already have
 
04:43:22.470 --> 04:43:22.480 align:start position:0%
laws or we considering laws to fine-tune
 
04:43:25.190 --> 04:43:25.200 align:start position:0%
exactly what a parent's rights are and
 
04:43:27.070 --> 04:43:27.080 align:start position:0%
how to protect children when those
 
04:43:30.390 --> 04:43:30.400 align:start position:0%
parents should be reported we're all
 
04:43:33.110 --> 04:43:33.120 align:start position:0%
mandated reporters so I'm thinking that
 
04:43:37.470 --> 04:43:37.480 align:start position:0%
if a child at school says tells tells
 
04:43:39.670 --> 04:43:39.680 align:start position:0%
somebody that things are really going
 
04:43:41.628 --> 04:43:41.638 align:start position:0%
badly at home
 
04:43:43.190 --> 04:43:43.200 align:start position:0%
that's not we're not talking about
 
04:43:45.150 --> 04:43:45.160 align:start position:0%
parental rights there we're talking
 
04:43:48.270 --> 04:43:48.280 align:start position:0%
about mandated reporting so I think it's
 
04:43:51.110 --> 04:43:51.120 align:start position:0%
a really good to continue this to work
 
04:43:54.470 --> 04:43:54.480 align:start position:0%
on this bill to refine the wording so
 
04:43:57.948 --> 04:43:57.958 align:start position:0%
that it's it's clear so that not one
 
04:43:59.948 --> 04:43:59.958 align:start position:0%
parent could go to another school system
 
04:44:03.708 --> 04:44:03.718 align:start position:0%
and say I want all your records uh we
 
04:44:07.990 --> 04:44:08.000 align:start position:0%
obviously do go and use data from many
 
04:44:09.990 --> 04:44:10.000 align:start position:0%
different school systems to put out a
 
04:44:13.510 --> 04:44:13.520 align:start position:0%
report uh our schools are having some
 
04:44:16.510 --> 04:44:16.520 align:start position:0%
real problems I was shocked as a
 
04:44:18.708 --> 04:44:18.718 align:start position:0%
resident of Salem which is a pretty big
 
04:44:21.510 --> 04:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
town not not
 
04:44:25.590 --> 04:44:25.600 align:start position:0%
poor and the reports on the children's
 
04:44:25.600 --> 04:44:27.390 align:start position:0%
poor and the reports on the children's
uh

04:44:27.390 --> 04:44:27.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:44:30.670 --> 04:44:30.680 align:start position:0%
achievements um educational achievements
 
04:44:32.868 --> 04:44:32.878 align:start position:0%
they're about
 
04:44:35.110 --> 04:44:35.120 align:start position:0%
50% I don't know about you but that
 
04:44:38.270 --> 04:44:38.280 align:start position:0%
sounds terrible to me so something is
 
04:44:40.788 --> 04:44:40.798 align:start position:0%
the matter I know we've adjusted uh how
 
04:44:44.430 --> 04:44:44.440 align:start position:0%
to to teach reading which is a basic you
 
04:44:46.470 --> 04:44:46.480 align:start position:0%
know the B if you can't read well you're
 
04:44:49.910 --> 04:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
not going to do well in anything except
 
04:44:53.910 --> 04:44:53.920 align:start position:0%
PE even written tests you know not there
 
04:44:56.910 --> 04:44:56.920 align:start position:0%
so obviously we're trying to work on
 
04:45:00.190 --> 04:45:00.200 align:start position:0%
issues I think parental rights have come
 
04:45:00.200 --> 04:45:01.708 align:start position:0%
issues I think parental rights have come
under

04:45:01.708 --> 04:45:01.718 align:start position:0%
under
 
04:45:05.628 --> 04:45:05.638 align:start position:0%
attack and uh need to be written down
 
04:45:08.550 --> 04:45:08.560 align:start position:0%
exactly what is okay and what a parent
 
04:45:11.868 --> 04:45:11.878 align:start position:0%
can expect because you know nobody's
 
04:45:13.788 --> 04:45:13.798 align:start position:0%
talking about the experiences that
 
04:45:16.990 --> 04:45:17.000 align:start position:0%
they've had that were just crazy that
 
04:45:19.310 --> 04:45:19.320 align:start position:0%
they didn't feel this the school
 
04:45:21.868 --> 04:45:21.878 align:start position:0%
Personnel didn't feel like telling the
 
04:45:24.868 --> 04:45:24.878 align:start position:0%
parent something that we would think was
 
04:45:28.190 --> 04:45:28.200 align:start position:0%
appropriate so I trust I trust that
 
04:45:31.270 --> 04:45:31.280 align:start position:0%
y'all can finetune this so it really
 
04:45:34.948 --> 04:45:34.958 align:start position:0%
really will be a valuable tool thank you
 
04:45:36.550 --> 04:45:36.560 align:start position:0%
thank you very much you have six seconds
 
04:45:38.550 --> 04:45:38.560 align:start position:0%
in the
 
04:45:40.628 --> 04:45:40.638 align:start position:0%
bank I think you've already given them
 
04:45:43.350 --> 04:45:43.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:46.430 --> 04:45:46.440 align:start position:0%
yeah uh before we go on to the next
 
04:45:49.390 --> 04:45:49.400 align:start position:0%
person these were handouts that I don't
 
04:45:52.590 --> 04:45:52.600 align:start position:0%
see match a pink card so they may have
 
04:45:55.110 --> 04:45:55.120 align:start position:0%
been dropped off so why don't I pass
 
04:45:58.430 --> 04:45:58.440 align:start position:0%
them around and if I over did or under
 
04:46:07.830 --> 04:46:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:14.270 --> 04:46:14.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:24.550 --> 04:46:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:29.590 --> 04:46:29.600 align:start position:0%
Beerman hi Nancy Beerman New Boston um
 
04:46:33.310 --> 04:46:33.320 align:start position:0%
Mom of two teacher of 15 years with a
 
04:46:36.310 --> 04:46:36.320 align:start position:0%
master's degree I am also on the rare
 
04:46:38.070 --> 04:46:38.080 align:start position:0%
disease advisory Council for New
 
04:46:40.470 --> 04:46:40.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I am representing myself today
 
04:46:42.150 --> 04:46:42.160 align:start position:0%
and not the
 
04:46:45.948 --> 04:46:45.958 align:start position:0%
council uh as far as the medical um part
 
04:46:48.350 --> 04:46:48.360 align:start position:0%
of this bill I do have to tell you that
 
04:46:50.110 --> 04:46:50.120 align:start position:0%
as a parent with a child with a rare
 
04:46:54.230 --> 04:46:54.240 align:start position:0%
disease it just about made me very upset
 
04:46:56.230 --> 04:46:56.240 align:start position:0%
when Dartmouth Hitchcock sent a letter
 
04:46:59.030 --> 04:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
when my child turned 14 and said sorry
 
04:47:01.390 --> 04:47:01.400 align:start position:0%
you as a parent have no longer access to
 
04:47:03.230 --> 04:47:03.240 align:start position:0%
the portal and to anything that is with
 
04:47:06.190 --> 04:47:06.200 align:start position:0%
her records I will tell you that is very
 
04:47:08.708 --> 04:47:08.718 align:start position:0%
concerning first of all because most of
 
04:47:11.910 --> 04:47:11.920 align:start position:0%
the doctors had no idea how to deal with
 
04:47:16.110 --> 04:47:16.120 align:start position:0%
and understand her rare disease and um
 
04:47:19.350 --> 04:47:19.360 align:start position:0%
my child did not have the understanding
 
04:47:22.270 --> 04:47:22.280 align:start position:0%
still in her 20s still has a hard time
 
04:47:24.390 --> 04:47:24.400 align:start position:0%
understanding all the medical jargon and
 
04:47:27.708 --> 04:47:27.718 align:start position:0%
information and needs an advocate and
 
04:47:31.150 --> 04:47:31.160 align:start position:0%
support to understand what is going on
 
04:47:34.070 --> 04:47:34.080 align:start position:0%
um I was and I expressed my concern to
 
04:47:36.990 --> 04:47:37.000 align:start position:0%
the doctors about the fact that they
 
04:47:39.830 --> 04:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
were keeping possible information from
 
04:47:42.990 --> 04:47:43.000 align:start position:0%
me about my child child um of course my
 
04:47:44.708 --> 04:47:44.718 align:start position:0%
child gave me the password and the
 
04:47:46.990 --> 04:47:47.000 align:start position:0%
username and I logged on and I was the
 
04:47:48.868 --> 04:47:48.878 align:start position:0%
one that was doing 90% of the
 
04:47:51.270 --> 04:47:51.280 align:start position:0%
communication because my child was
 
04:47:55.030 --> 04:47:55.040 align:start position:0%
unable to she was that sick uh so as far
 
04:47:57.868 --> 04:47:57.878 align:start position:0%
as a rare disease parent and any parent
 
04:47:59.830 --> 04:47:59.840 align:start position:0%
that has a child that has any chronic
 
04:48:01.830 --> 04:48:01.840 align:start position:0%
medical illness
 
04:48:04.868 --> 04:48:04.878 align:start position:0%
keeping information from parents and not
 
04:48:06.270 --> 04:48:06.280 align:start position:0%
letting the parents communicate with the
 
04:48:08.948 --> 04:48:08.958 align:start position:0%
doctor can be dangerous the parent knows
 
04:48:11.270 --> 04:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
the information the child doesn't
 
04:48:13.750 --> 04:48:13.760 align:start position:0%
if you were 13 14 15 years old do you
 
04:48:15.510 --> 04:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
know your family's history do you know
 
04:48:17.990 --> 04:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
all the medical information do you know
 
04:48:19.830 --> 04:48:19.840 align:start position:0%
other concerns that the doctor should be
 
04:48:22.070 --> 04:48:22.080 align:start position:0%
aware of no you don't because you don't
 
04:48:23.910 --> 04:48:23.920 align:start position:0%
care about that you care about just
 
04:48:27.948 --> 04:48:27.958 align:start position:0%
being healthy and be able to um get on
 
04:48:30.788 --> 04:48:30.798 align:start position:0%
with your day and not be in pain um as
 
04:48:33.830 --> 04:48:33.840 align:start position:0%
far as a teacher um I hope this bill
 
04:48:35.628 --> 04:48:35.638 align:start position:0%
brings back professionalism in the
 
04:48:40.310 --> 04:48:40.320 align:start position:0%
teacher position um I don't understand
 
04:48:42.868 --> 04:48:42.878 align:start position:0%
why teacher feel like they can cross the
 
04:48:45.030 --> 04:48:45.040 align:start position:0%
line I was always taught that there was
 
04:48:48.150 --> 04:48:48.160 align:start position:0%
a line and you don't cross it between a
 
04:48:50.990 --> 04:48:51.000 align:start position:0%
f a parent and a child in 15 years of
 
04:48:54.390 --> 04:48:54.400 align:start position:0%
teaching I had to report two families in
 
04:48:56.990 --> 04:48:57.000 align:start position:0%
15 years only two families the way you
 
04:48:59.150 --> 04:48:59.160 align:start position:0%
have people come up here talking it's
 
04:49:00.670 --> 04:49:00.680 align:start position:0%
like teachers are reporting families
 
04:49:02.750 --> 04:49:02.760 align:start position:0%
every day they are
 
04:49:05.430 --> 04:49:05.440 align:start position:0%
not I am concerned that a New Hampshire
 
04:49:07.190 --> 04:49:07.200 align:start position:0%
teacher tried to get custody of a
 
04:49:08.948 --> 04:49:08.958 align:start position:0%
student and have them move into their
 
04:49:12.030 --> 04:49:12.040 align:start position:0%
house recently that was very scary
 
04:49:15.510 --> 04:49:15.520 align:start position:0%
situation um and as far as parents go we
 
04:49:17.628 --> 04:49:17.638 align:start position:0%
do not give up custody of our child as
 
04:49:20.868 --> 04:49:20.878 align:start position:0%
soon as they cross and go into the
 
04:49:20.878 --> 04:49:21.948 align:start position:0%
soon as they cross and go into the
school

04:49:21.948 --> 04:49:21.958 align:start position:0%
school
 
04:49:24.030 --> 04:49:24.040 align:start position:0%
building as a teacher I don't have
 
04:49:25.990 --> 04:49:26.000 align:start position:0%
custody of that child that is a parents
 
04:49:30.670 --> 04:49:30.680 align:start position:0%
decision wrap it up please uh finally
 
04:49:33.390 --> 04:49:33.400 align:start position:0%
um teachers are not kids friends
 
04:49:35.390 --> 04:49:35.400 align:start position:0%
administrators should not be encouraging
 
04:49:37.030 --> 04:49:37.040 align:start position:0%
teachers to have
 
04:49:41.070 --> 04:49:41.080 align:start position:0%
relationships with their students should
 
04:49:43.350 --> 04:49:43.360 align:start position:0%
be a professional boundary thank you
 
04:49:46.510 --> 04:49:46.520 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions for the witness
 
04:49:51.310 --> 04:49:51.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:54.708 --> 04:49:54.718 align:start position:0%
coming Megan Tuttle and Brian Hawkins
 
04:50:00.990 --> 04:50:01.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:04.350 --> 04:50:04.360 align:start position:0%
EA which is
 
04:50:06.708 --> 04:50:06.718 align:start position:0%
what well it's for the record I know
 
04:50:09.628 --> 04:50:09.638 align:start position:0%
what it is don't ask a question answer
 
04:50:11.350 --> 04:50:11.360 align:start position:0%
for the record it's not the National
 
04:50:14.390 --> 04:50:14.400 align:start position:0%
Endowment for the Arts oh I had a
 
04:50:15.868 --> 04:50:15.878 align:start position:0%
project although I'm sure that's a
 
04:50:19.948 --> 04:50:19.958 align:start position:0%
lovely place to work as well so um thank
 
04:50:22.030 --> 04:50:22.040 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman for the record Brian
 
04:50:24.230 --> 04:50:24.240 align:start position:0%
Hawkins from the National Education
 
04:50:26.590 --> 04:50:26.600 align:start position:0%
Association New Hampshire uh we
 
04:50:30.310 --> 04:50:30.320 align:start position:0%
represent um K12 Educators across the
 
04:50:33.310 --> 04:50:33.320 align:start position:0%
state um and we're here today in
 
04:50:36.910 --> 04:50:36.920 align:start position:0%
opposition to the bill um I do have some
 
04:50:38.830 --> 04:50:38.840 align:start position:0%
testimony that was based on the original
 
04:50:40.670 --> 04:50:40.680 align:start position:0%
version of the bill and so I'll try to
 
04:50:43.430 --> 04:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
just touch on the points I think seem to
 
04:50:47.590 --> 04:50:47.600 align:start position:0%
be consistent with the the amendment um
 
04:50:51.470 --> 04:50:51.480 align:start position:0%
so first um as was stated earlier we are
 
04:50:53.788 --> 04:50:53.798 align:start position:0%
obviously pleased that the criminal
 
04:50:56.510 --> 04:50:56.520 align:start position:0%
penalties were removed from this bill um
 
04:50:59.708 --> 04:50:59.718 align:start position:0%
but it still leaves um it was mentioned
 
04:51:01.990 --> 04:51:02.000 align:start position:0%
earlier where the where the line is it
 
04:51:04.590 --> 04:51:04.600 align:start position:0%
still leaves some some vague language in
 
04:51:06.350 --> 04:51:06.360 align:start position:0%
there that were concerned so that
 
04:51:08.830 --> 04:51:08.840 align:start position:0%
Educators can follow whatever law is
 
04:51:11.868 --> 04:51:11.878 align:start position:0%
passed from from the legislature um
 
04:51:14.548 --> 04:51:14.558 align:start position:0%
house B 10 is stating that uh all
 
04:51:16.470 --> 04:51:16.480 align:start position:0%
parental rights are reserved including
 
04:51:19.590 --> 04:51:19.600 align:start position:0%
but not limited to so this leaves open
 
04:51:20.910 --> 04:51:20.920 align:start position:0%
that there are other rights or
 
04:51:23.190 --> 04:51:23.200 align:start position:0%
violations that could happen which would
 
04:51:25.350 --> 04:51:25.360 align:start position:0%
cause the person to have violated those
 
04:51:28.070 --> 04:51:28.080 align:start position:0%
rights to be it's not criminally
 
04:51:30.948 --> 04:51:30.958 align:start position:0%
prosecuted anymore but um there is
 
04:51:33.670 --> 04:51:33.680 align:start position:0%
language in there about a potential uh
 
04:51:36.868 --> 04:51:36.878 align:start position:0%
discipline um similarly there are the
 
04:51:39.470 --> 04:51:39.480 align:start position:0%
two uh issues that got that were brought
 
04:51:42.470 --> 04:51:42.480 align:start position:0%
up in the front half of the list of
 
04:51:45.350 --> 04:51:45.360 align:start position:0%
Rights for parents the right to uh
 
04:51:49.310 --> 04:51:49.320 align:start position:0%
direct the upbringing and moral or
 
04:51:51.990 --> 04:51:52.000 align:start position:0%
religious more I'm sorry I think I might
 
04:51:55.030 --> 04:51:55.040 align:start position:0%
have bumped the button actually but I'll
 
04:51:56.390 --> 04:51:56.400 align:start position:0%
continue I don't want to lose too many
 
04:51:56.400 --> 04:52:00.470 align:start position:0%
continue I don't want to lose too many
seconds

04:52:00.470 --> 04:52:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:05.948 --> 04:52:05.958 align:start position:0%
here I always run out of time so uh um
 
04:52:07.390 --> 04:52:07.400 align:start position:0%
so we're we're concerned that that that
 
04:52:10.070 --> 04:52:10.080 align:start position:0%
is vague we're that's not grounded in
 
04:52:10.080 --> 04:52:11.070 align:start position:0%
is vague we're that's not grounded in
any

04:52:11.070 --> 04:52:11.080 align:start position:0%
any
 
04:52:13.788 --> 04:52:13.798 align:start position:0%
statute is just there and it's unclear
 
04:52:18.030 --> 04:52:18.040 align:start position:0%
who would Define that um and so again
 
04:52:20.948 --> 04:52:20.958 align:start position:0%
clarity about what we're talking about
 
04:52:22.830 --> 04:52:22.840 align:start position:0%
um there are there are morals discussed
 
04:52:25.830 --> 04:52:25.840 align:start position:0%
in school all the time um you know and
 
04:52:29.310 --> 04:52:29.320 align:start position:0%
so um sharing and caring about the
 
04:52:31.310 --> 04:52:31.320 align:start position:0%
community things like that so where
 
04:52:32.628 --> 04:52:32.638 align:start position:0%
where what are we talking about when
 
04:52:34.628 --> 04:52:34.638 align:start position:0%
we're talking about specifically because
 
04:52:36.750 --> 04:52:36.760 align:start position:0%
it says the right to direct that and I
 
04:52:38.708 --> 04:52:38.718 align:start position:0%
think some previous speakers raised some
 
04:52:42.350 --> 04:52:42.360 align:start position:0%
concerns about um you know how granular
 
04:52:45.190 --> 04:52:45.200 align:start position:0%
granular are we talking about there um
 
04:52:47.270 --> 04:52:47.280 align:start position:0%
I've got to make sure that the some of
 
04:52:49.430 --> 04:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
the other concerns that I have listed
 
04:52:51.750 --> 04:52:51.760 align:start position:0%
here are still consistent with the
 
04:52:54.628 --> 04:52:54.638 align:start position:0%
amendment but um as I mentioned earlier
 
04:52:56.868 --> 04:52:56.878 align:start position:0%
there is a a reference there about the
 
04:52:59.110 --> 04:52:59.120 align:start position:0%
possibility of disciplinary action being
 
04:53:01.548 --> 04:53:01.558 align:start position:0%
referenced and so that that's a little
 
04:53:03.270 --> 04:53:03.280 align:start position:0%
unclear about who are we talking about
 
04:53:04.628 --> 04:53:04.638 align:start position:0%
are we talking about the school or we
 
04:53:07.788 --> 04:53:07.798 align:start position:0%
talking about the doe um this is this is
 
04:53:12.470 --> 04:53:12.480 align:start position:0%
unclear um and I'll close uh by saying
 
04:53:14.350 --> 04:53:14.360 align:start position:0%
that you know I think someone mentioned
 
04:53:16.788 --> 04:53:16.798 align:start position:0%
earlier that parents and Educators have
 
04:53:18.868 --> 04:53:18.878 align:start position:0%
been working really well together in the
 
04:53:21.788 --> 04:53:21.798 align:start position:0%
state for a long time and we ought to be
 
04:53:23.990 --> 04:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
focused on legislation that's going to
 
04:53:28.150 --> 04:53:28.160 align:start position:0%
help Foster that uh relationship and I
 
04:53:32.190 --> 04:53:32.200 align:start position:0%
think that this um this um takes us in
 
04:53:35.390 --> 04:53:35.400 align:start position:0%
the opposite direction the one last
 
04:53:38.070 --> 04:53:38.080 align:start position:0%
specific thing that I'll just mention uh
 
04:53:41.190 --> 04:53:41.200 align:start position:0%
I would just ask uh that the committee
 
04:53:45.150 --> 04:53:45.160 align:start position:0%
take a look at um on page three uh Roman
 
04:53:48.590 --> 04:53:48.600 align:start position:0%
2 there's a reference in letter B to a
 
04:53:53.510 --> 04:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
statute uh that I may be wrong but
 
04:53:59.230 --> 04:53:59.240 align:start position:0%
18611 Roman 9C has to do with reviewing
 
04:54:02.190 --> 04:54:02.200 align:start position:0%
um uh the board with for the Board of
 
04:54:04.948 --> 04:54:04.958 align:start position:0%
Education to review HIV AIDS curriculum
 
04:54:06.670 --> 04:54:06.680 align:start position:0%
and I'm not sure if that
 
04:54:09.830 --> 04:54:09.840 align:start position:0%
is what your was intended here it looks
 
04:54:10.910 --> 04:54:10.920 align:start position:0%
like this
 
04:54:13.548 --> 04:54:13.558 align:start position:0%
is is trying to uh have some protective
 
04:54:15.230 --> 04:54:15.240 align:start position:0%
language around law
 
04:54:18.670 --> 04:54:18.680 align:start position:0%
enforcement um so unless I have the
 
04:54:20.948 --> 04:54:20.958 align:start position:0%
wrong statute uh or the wrong version of
 
04:54:23.670 --> 04:54:23.680 align:start position:0%
the bill um you may want to take a look
 
04:54:26.470 --> 04:54:26.480 align:start position:0%
at that and then uh we have the same
 
04:54:29.110 --> 04:54:29.120 align:start position:0%
concern about U that Nami race about the
 
04:54:31.190 --> 04:54:31.200 align:start position:0%
encouraged language and that that that
 
04:54:34.350 --> 04:54:34.360 align:start position:0%
too is is is very Broad and subjective
 
04:54:35.750 --> 04:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
so I'll close there and happy to take
 
04:54:35.760 --> 04:54:38.548 align:start position:0%
so I'll close there and happy to take
any

04:54:38.548 --> 04:54:38.558 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:40.788 --> 04:54:40.798 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you okay
 
04:54:42.430 --> 04:54:42.440 align:start position:0%

04:54:45.510 --> 04:54:45.520 align:start position:0%

Cornerstone and you have handouts yes Mr
 
04:54:53.868 --> 04:54:53.878 align:start position:0%
chairman may I distribute these you may
 
04:55:06.350 --> 04:55:06.360 align:start position:0%

Simone for their passion for parents
 
04:55:17.150 --> 04:55:17.160 align:start position:0%
rights Ian huitt appearing for
 
04:55:19.110 --> 04:55:19.120 align:start position:0%
Cornerstone and I've just broken the
 
04:55:21.230 --> 04:55:21.240 align:start position:0%
first rule of trial advocacy which is
 
04:55:23.070 --> 04:55:23.080 align:start position:0%
never distribute an exhibit to the jury
 
04:55:24.548 --> 04:55:24.558 align:start position:0%
when you're about to speak but I want
 
04:55:28.590 --> 04:55:28.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:30.910 --> 04:55:30.920 align:start position:0%
see I normally hold to that but I want
 
04:55:32.628 --> 04:55:32.638 align:start position:0%
you all to see what I am talking about
 
04:55:34.708 --> 04:55:34.718 align:start position:0%
in my testimony and what I've just
 
04:55:38.190 --> 04:55:38.200 align:start position:0%
passed around are the operative the main
 
04:55:41.708 --> 04:55:41.718 align:start position:0%
operative Clauses from Senate bill 272
 
04:55:41.718 --> 04:55:42.830 align:start position:0%
operative Clauses from Senate bill 272
in

04:55:42.830 --> 04:55:42.840 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:55:45.628 --> 04:55:45.638 align:start position:0%
2023 which was the Senate parents Bill
 
04:55:47.670 --> 04:55:47.680 align:start position:0%
of Rights the language you have in front
 
04:55:51.430 --> 04:55:51.440 align:start position:0%
of you is taken verbatim from 272 in
 
04:55:55.030 --> 04:55:55.040 align:start position:0%
2023 and this language passed the Senate
 
04:55:58.150 --> 04:55:58.160 align:start position:0%
a a majority of returning Senators not
 
04:55:59.830 --> 04:55:59.840 align:start position:0%
only voted for but sponsored this
 
04:56:03.230 --> 04:56:03.240 align:start position:0%
language and it lost the house in 2023
 
04:56:06.990 --> 04:56:07.000 align:start position:0%
by about five votes depending upon what
 
04:56:08.990 --> 04:56:09.000 align:start position:0%
roll call vote you look at so it should
 
04:56:11.868 --> 04:56:11.878 align:start position:0%
have no problem passing the house this
 
04:56:14.510 --> 04:56:14.520 align:start position:0%
session the idea of a parents Bill of
 
04:56:17.708 --> 04:56:17.718 align:start position:0%
Rights really came up because school
 
04:56:19.390 --> 04:56:19.400 align:start position:0%
districts across New Hampshire have
 
04:56:21.230 --> 04:56:21.240 align:start position:0%
adopted policies in which they
 
04:56:24.030 --> 04:56:24.040 align:start position:0%
explicitly say that schools will not
 
04:56:26.670 --> 04:56:26.680 align:start position:0%
only conceal transitioning from parents
 
04:56:30.190 --> 04:56:30.200 align:start position:0%
but will affirmatively lie to parents to
 
04:56:33.190 --> 04:56:33.200 align:start position:0%
conceal a child's transitioning and I I
 
04:56:34.868 --> 04:56:34.878 align:start position:0%
can't really underscore enough how
 
04:56:37.310 --> 04:56:37.320 align:start position:0%
bizarre this is and how strange New
 
04:56:39.868 --> 04:56:39.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is in this area I've closely
 
04:56:42.350 --> 04:56:42.360 align:start position:0%
reviewed viewed at least a dozen School
 
04:56:45.190 --> 04:56:45.200 align:start position:0%
District policies on the area of gender
 
04:56:48.510 --> 04:56:48.520 align:start position:0%
identity in Massachusetts and I am not
 
04:56:50.750 --> 04:56:50.760 align:start position:0%
aware of a single School District policy
 
04:56:53.030 --> 04:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
in Massachusetts not even Boston or
 
04:56:55.510 --> 04:56:55.520 align:start position:0%
Cambridge that says expressly School
 
04:56:57.708 --> 04:56:57.718 align:start position:0%
Personnel should lie to parents to
 
04:57:00.270 --> 04:57:00.280 align:start position:0%
conceal transitioning like most New
 
04:57:02.948 --> 04:57:02.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire school district policies say
 
04:57:04.708 --> 04:57:04.718 align:start position:0%
and I think this has happened because
 
04:57:06.590 --> 04:57:06.600 align:start position:0%
National donors and
 
04:57:10.190 --> 04:57:10.200 align:start position:0%
organizations like the ACLU and glad and
 
04:57:12.788 --> 04:57:12.798 align:start position:0%
listen see New Hampshire which is a
 
04:57:14.510 --> 04:57:14.520 align:start position:0%
competitive purple State as a
 
04:57:16.868 --> 04:57:16.878 align:start position:0%
Battleground and a laboratory and
 
04:57:19.590 --> 04:57:19.600 align:start position:0%
they're therefore very invested in
 
04:57:21.670 --> 04:57:21.680 align:start position:0%
making sure that model policies are
 
04:57:23.390 --> 04:57:23.400 align:start position:0%
passed in every single one of our school
 
04:57:25.670 --> 04:57:25.680 align:start position:0%
districts the result being that parents
 
04:57:27.750 --> 04:57:27.760 align:start position:0%
rights are much more limited in New
 
04:57:29.390 --> 04:57:29.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire today in the LI for your die
 
04:57:32.150 --> 04:57:32.160 align:start position:0%
State than in Massachusetts so
 
04:57:34.310 --> 04:57:34.320 align:start position:0%
Cornerstone is constantly exploring ways
 
04:57:36.070 --> 04:57:36.080 align:start position:0%
we could challenge these secret
 
04:57:38.830 --> 04:57:38.840 align:start position:0%
transitioning and deception policies
 
04:57:40.708 --> 04:57:40.718 align:start position:0%
theoretically we have three Avenues to
 
04:57:42.948 --> 04:57:42.958 align:start position:0%
challenge them State constitutional
 
04:57:44.708 --> 04:57:44.718 align:start position:0%
rights state statutory rights or
 
04:57:46.788 --> 04:57:46.798 align:start position:0%
politically through the general court as
 
04:57:48.190 --> 04:57:48.200 align:start position:0%
you've heard about today the state
 
04:57:50.670 --> 04:57:50.680 align:start position:0%
constitutional Avenue is foreclosed our
 
04:57:53.270 --> 04:57:53.280 align:start position:0%
state Supreme Court held effectively
 
04:57:55.390 --> 04:57:55.400 align:start position:0%
that parents rights are something that
 
04:57:57.430 --> 04:57:57.440 align:start position:0%
the child and the parent enjoy in
 
04:57:59.830 --> 04:57:59.840 align:start position:0%
concert together against the state when
 
04:58:01.990 --> 04:58:02.000 align:start position:0%
their wishes are aligned and they
 
04:58:03.510 --> 04:58:03.520 align:start position:0%
parents rights are not something under
 
04:58:05.070 --> 04:58:05.080 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Constitution that the
 
04:58:07.070 --> 04:58:07.080 align:start position:0%
parents have over the child against the
 
04:58:09.150 --> 04:58:09.160 align:start position:0%
state so we have no more State
 
04:58:12.270 --> 04:58:12.280 align:start position:0%
constitutional remedy the issue is if
 
04:58:14.230 --> 04:58:14.240 align:start position:0%
the general court passed a list of
 
04:58:17.230 --> 04:58:17.240 align:start position:0%
enumerated parents rights that did not
 
04:58:19.628 --> 04:58:19.638 align:start position:0%
address secret transitioning that would
 
04:58:22.310 --> 04:58:22.320 align:start position:0%
at least foreclose all of our remaining
 
04:58:24.470 --> 04:58:24.480 align:start position:0%
State statutory remedies if not all of
 
04:58:26.868 --> 04:58:26.878 align:start position:0%
our remaining avenues for addressing
 
04:58:29.430 --> 04:58:29.440 align:start position:0%
secret transitioning so to be clear our
 
04:58:31.868 --> 04:58:31.878 align:start position:0%
position is not we would like to see a
 
04:58:33.548 --> 04:58:33.558 align:start position:0%
perfect parents Bill of Rights or we
 
04:58:36.750 --> 04:58:36.760 align:start position:0%
don't want to see a bill our position is
 
04:58:39.350 --> 04:58:39.360 align:start position:0%
that the general court should not take a
 
04:58:41.070 --> 04:58:41.080 align:start position:0%
step that would put us in a worse
 
04:58:42.788 --> 04:58:42.798 align:start position:0%
position with respect to this critical
 
04:58:45.350 --> 04:58:45.360 align:start position:0%
issue and actually set us back in court
 
04:58:47.788 --> 04:58:47.798 align:start position:0%
relative to where we are now so for if I
 
04:58:50.548 --> 04:58:50.558 align:start position:0%
may one more sentence Mr chairman uh for
 
04:58:52.510 --> 04:58:52.520 align:start position:0%
example if the general court were to
 
04:58:54.548 --> 04:58:54.558 align:start position:0%
pass almost anything else on parents
 
04:58:56.110 --> 04:58:56.120 align:start position:0%
rights like creating a parents Rights
 
04:58:57.708 --> 04:58:57.718 align:start position:0%
Commission or committee we would have no
 
04:58:59.350 --> 04:58:59.360 align:start position:0%
objection to that I'm doing the
 
04:59:00.948 --> 04:59:00.958 align:start position:0%
punctuation just to see what kind of a
 
04:59:03.150 --> 04:59:03.160 align:start position:0%
sentence it was thank you Mr chairman I
 
04:59:05.390 --> 04:59:05.400 align:start position:0%
believe it was a runon sentence but one
 
04:59:08.030 --> 04:59:08.040 align:start position:0%
nonetheless but thank you any questions
 
04:59:10.910 --> 04:59:10.920 align:start position:0%
for attorney HT
 
04:59:13.230 --> 04:59:13.240 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you thank you so much
 
04:59:14.750 --> 04:59:14.760 align:start position:0%
and with no more pink cards this
 
04:59:16.990 --> 04:59:17.000 align:start position:0%
concludes the hearing on House Bill 10
 
04:59:20.350 --> 04:59:20.360 align:start position:0%
it will be exact on March 4th so keep
 
04:59:26.100 --> 04:59:26.110 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:26.110 --> 04:59:27.510 align:start position:0%
