00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.429 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:03:53.429 --> 00:03:53.439 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 align:start position:0%
we shall all use our microphones
 
00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.070 align:start position:0%
we shall all use our microphones
so

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
for anybody who didn't get on the
 
00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 align:start position:0%
streaming and is interested one of the
 
00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 align:start position:0%
things we're going to talk about is
 
00:04:06.309 --> 00:04:06.319 align:start position:0%
whether what we should do is simply move
 
00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:08.799 align:start position:0%
some of the text from this bill
 
00:04:10.869 --> 00:04:10.879 align:start position:0%
to the section that is already the
 
00:04:13.589 --> 00:04:13.599 align:start position:0%
patient's bill of rights it's
 
00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 align:start position:0%
rsa 151 colon i think it's 21.
 
00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 align:start position:0%
but i'm going to go through the changes
 
00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 align:start position:0%
that i made here anyway just so we're
 
00:04:25.189 --> 00:04:25.199 align:start position:0%
all on the same page
 
00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:26.870 align:start position:0%
all on the same page
in

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 align:start position:0%
the section on
 
00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 align:start position:0%
miners i just changed the reference to
 
00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:33.590 align:start position:0%
miners i just changed the reference to
hospital

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
and i'm sorry i couldn't change it on
 
00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:37.600 align:start position:0%
the ones with numbers
 
00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 align:start position:0%
so you're just going to have it that's
 
00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 align:start position:0%
on the front page
 
00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 align:start position:0%
under roman one um instead of healthcare
 
00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 align:start position:0%
facility licensed pursuant to
 
00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 align:start position:0%
151.2 i said hospital as defined in
 
00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:53.919 align:start position:0%
and gave the specific reference and
 
00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
because i thought it was less likely
 
00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.240 align:start position:0%
that a child is going to be in a nursing
 
00:04:59.830 --> 00:04:59.840 align:start position:0%
home or other things i just said
 
00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:01.600 align:start position:0%
hospital there
 
00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:04.880 align:start position:0%
but that's entirely open to negotiation
 
00:05:07.749 --> 00:05:07.759 align:start position:0%
if people want to put more things in
 
00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.120 align:start position:0%
for the adults i put the reference their
 
00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 align:start position:0%
nursing home and rehabilitation facility
 
00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:16.639 align:start position:0%
and i don't have the right references
 
00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:18.320 align:start position:0%
for those but i
 
00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
will find somebody to help me out with
 
00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.510 align:start position:0%
will find somebody to help me out with
those

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:21.520 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
i didn't change any of the language just
 
00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:25.120 align:start position:0%
the definition
 
00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:28.160 align:start position:0%
then when we go down to roman four
 
00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:34.479 align:start position:0%
we talked about who provided the
 
00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:36.560 align:start position:0%
personal protective equipment so i
 
00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
struck out
 
00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 align:start position:0%
provided that any such required
 
00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:41.680 align:start position:0%
equipment she'll be provided by the
 
00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
health care facility i wrote provided by
 
00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
this facility or provided by the visitor
 
00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:49.759 align:start position:0%
and approved by the facility
 
00:05:52.629 --> 00:05:52.639 align:start position:0%
so that that leaves a certain amount of
 
00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:56.000 align:start position:0%
autonomy in either direction
 
00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:58.560 align:start position:0%
then when we go down to seven you
 
00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:00.880 align:start position:0%
remember that the department was
 
00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:03.680 align:start position:0%
concerned about the
 
00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:03.910 align:start position:0%
concerned about the
the

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:03.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:05.590 align:start position:0%
the
[Music]

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:05.600 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:07.840 align:start position:0%
informational materials and we thought
 
00:06:09.749 --> 00:06:09.759 align:start position:0%
that those were better left to the
 
00:06:09.759 --> 00:06:10.950 align:start position:0%
that those were better left to the
facility

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:10.960 align:start position:0%
facility
 
00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.230 align:start position:0%
facility
itself

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:12.240 align:start position:0%
itself
 
00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:14.080 align:start position:0%
we will require them to have the
 
00:06:17.749 --> 00:06:17.759 align:start position:0%
materials but they develop the materials
 
00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:20.720 align:start position:0%
because it's not a one-size-fits-all and
 
00:06:22.309 --> 00:06:22.319 align:start position:0%
and it's not what the department of
 
00:06:22.319 --> 00:06:23.189 align:start position:0%
and it's not what the department of
health

00:06:23.189 --> 00:06:23.199 align:start position:0%
health
 
00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:25.840 align:start position:0%
human services does so i just struck out
 
00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:28.560 align:start position:0%
all the references to dhhs
 
00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:31.360 align:start position:0%
and left the requirement that the
 
00:06:33.189 --> 00:06:33.199 align:start position:0%
uh facility
 
00:06:37.749 --> 00:06:37.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:41.440 align:start position:0%
write up the informational materials
 
00:06:43.749 --> 00:06:43.759 align:start position:0%
in eight
 
00:06:47.189 --> 00:06:47.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:49.360 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:06:51.749 --> 00:06:51.759 align:start position:0%
limitation of liability to arising out
 
00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
of this section
 
00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:56.240 align:start position:0%
and i struck c
 
00:06:58.309 --> 00:06:58.319 align:start position:0%
failing to follow the guidelines of cdc
 
00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:00.240 align:start position:0%
because that was the part that i thought
 
00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:03.520 align:start position:0%
that dhhs objected to the most
 
00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:06.560 align:start position:0%
but that's all still negotiable so
 
00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:10.720 align:start position:0%
that's that's just what i put down to
 
00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:11.670 align:start position:0%
that's that's just what i put down to
uh

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:11.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:12.880 align:start position:0%
think about
 
00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:14.720 align:start position:0%
for next time but i
 
00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:16.400 align:start position:0%
i wanted to talk about that and i wanted
 
00:07:18.309 --> 00:07:18.319 align:start position:0%
to talk about what you thought about
 
00:07:21.909 --> 00:07:21.919 align:start position:0%
just lifting the pieces
 
00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
does anybody hear from dhhs oh good yeah
 
00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
oh sorry
 
00:07:28.309 --> 00:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
can't see that far
 
00:07:31.589 --> 00:07:31.599 align:start position:0%
my apologies um
 
00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:34.400 align:start position:0%
but i did want to just ask people how
 
00:07:36.309 --> 00:07:36.319 align:start position:0%
they thought about lifting part of this
 
00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
and just inserting it into the patient's
 
00:07:41.189 --> 00:07:41.199 align:start position:0%
bill of rights where it would be
 
00:07:43.589 --> 00:07:43.599 align:start position:0%
balanced with everybody else's rights
 
00:07:43.599 --> 00:07:47.830 align:start position:0%
balanced with everybody else's rights
and

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
i'll stop talking now somebody else may
 
00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:53.270 align:start position:0%
i'll stop talking now somebody else may
talk

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:55.589 --> 00:07:55.599 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i um i just have a
 
00:07:57.909 --> 00:07:57.919 align:start position:0%
couple of thoughts so in
 
00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:00.560 align:start position:0%
your roman numeral one
 
00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:04.080 align:start position:0%
instead of i just i'm concerned about
 
00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:05.110 align:start position:0%
instead of i just i'm concerned about
limiting

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:05.120 align:start position:0%
limiting
 
00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:06.230 align:start position:0%
limiting
further

00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
further
 
00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:07.189 align:start position:0%
further
where

00:08:07.189 --> 00:08:07.199 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:08:08.469 --> 00:08:08.479 align:start position:0%
parents can
 
00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:10.560 align:start position:0%
be accompanying a child
 
00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:12.240 align:start position:0%
i know it is rare but it does happen
 
00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:14.560 align:start position:0%
where children need to be in long-term
 
00:08:16.469 --> 00:08:16.479 align:start position:0%
care facilities
 
00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:18.240 align:start position:0%
so if we could do like if there are
 
00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:20.080 align:start position:0%
other facilities that you want to put in
 
00:08:21.749 --> 00:08:21.759 align:start position:0%
there i'm more than willing to
 
00:08:23.589 --> 00:08:23.599 align:start position:0%
incorporate them i just
 
00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:25.360 align:start position:0%
i was i was thinking about the
 
00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:27.280 align:start position:0%
difference between adult care and child
 
00:08:29.589 --> 00:08:29.599 align:start position:0%
care and i'm more than willing
 
00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:31.520 align:start position:0%
to insert whatever anybody else thinks
 
00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:33.680 align:start position:0%
needs to be inserted there yeah i think
 
00:08:36.149 --> 00:08:36.159 align:start position:0%
it's i think that line is
 
00:08:38.469 --> 00:08:38.479 align:start position:0%
i think in statute is
 
00:08:41.269 --> 00:08:41.279 align:start position:0%
comprehensive the way it is
 
00:08:41.279 --> 00:08:43.350 align:start position:0%
comprehensive the way it is
um

00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:43.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:46.240 align:start position:0%
so i don't see any reason to limit it
 
00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:50.240 align:start position:0%
well the problem with it being left to
 
00:08:53.269 --> 00:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
all of 151 2
 
00:08:55.990 --> 00:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
is it applies to renal care facilities
 
00:08:58.389 --> 00:08:58.399 align:start position:0%
it applies it applies to a whole range
 
00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:00.640 align:start position:0%
of things that are
 
00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:02.080 align:start position:0%
sort of different
 
00:09:03.509 --> 00:09:03.519 align:start position:0%
sort of care
 
00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:06.080 align:start position:0%
right it's it's lots of
 
00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:08.560 align:start position:0%
lots of different sorts of facilities so
 
00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:11.200 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't incorporate
 
00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:12.720 align:start position:0%
when you get to the adults it doesn't
 
00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:14.800 align:start position:0%
incorporate things like the nursing home
 
00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:16.550 align:start position:0%
incorporate things like the nursing home
so

00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:20.080 align:start position:0%
which we want to incorporate
 
00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
i think one of the important things is
 
00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:24.160 align:start position:0%
that with minors
 
00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
it's a very different equation if you're
 
00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:27.440 align:start position:0%
having them go into having a parent
 
00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:29.360 align:start position:0%
going with them to a dialysis center or
 
00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:31.200 align:start position:0%
somewhere else as opposed to an adult
 
00:09:33.269 --> 00:09:33.279 align:start position:0%
having somebody at one of those
 
00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:35.200 align:start position:0%
outpatient care facilities
 
00:09:37.269 --> 00:09:37.279 align:start position:0%
i would really like to see that the
 
00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
parents allowed to go
 
00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
just about anywhere as long as it's as
 
00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:42.640 align:start position:0%
long as it's not a risk obviously they
 
00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:45.200 align:start position:0%
wouldn't go into neurosurgery unless uh
 
00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:47.360 align:start position:0%
that was specifically arranged but i do
 
00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:48.880 align:start position:0%
want to see the parent being able to
 
00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:50.800 align:start position:0%
stay with the child
 
00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:52.470 align:start position:0%
stay with the child
okay

00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:52.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:54.640 align:start position:0%
and i do like uh more specifically
 
00:09:56.710 --> 00:09:56.720 align:start position:0%
limiting it for adults since we are
 
00:09:57.750 --> 00:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
looking to make sure we have the
 
00:09:59.829 --> 00:09:59.839 align:start position:0%
residential care facility and we want to
 
00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:01.680 align:start position:0%
make sure that we don't cause problems
 
00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
in the outpatient
 
00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:04.640 align:start position:0%
okay as well
 
00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:06.560 align:start position:0%
so thank you
 
00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:08.150 align:start position:0%
so thank you
okay

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:08.160 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:10:11.269 --> 00:10:11.279 align:start position:0%
yep uh also uh the infusion centers as
 
00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:12.720 align:start position:0%
well for kids
 
00:10:17.509 --> 00:10:17.519 align:start position:0%
um oncology uh that's uh would be a real
 
00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
a real plus to
 
00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:20.720 align:start position:0%
have them uh
 
00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
at that time
 
00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:24.240 align:start position:0%
uh um i'm sure if i are the infusion
 
00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
centers regulated under 151 too i don't
 
00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:29.440 align:start position:0%
know if they're part of
 
00:10:32.069 --> 00:10:32.079 align:start position:0%
a hospital a subsidiary
 
00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
that would probably be the case i'm not
 
00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:37.200 align:start position:0%
positive well if if they're under a
 
00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:38.470 align:start position:0%
positive well if if they're under a
hospital

00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:38.480 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:42.880 align:start position:0%
regulated as a hospital we're okay yeah
 
00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:46.160 align:start position:0%
i i know adele oncology units are
 
00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:47.430 align:start position:0%
i i know adele oncology units are
standalones

00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:47.440 align:start position:0%
standalones
 
00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:49.120 align:start position:0%
right so
 
00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:50.240 align:start position:0%
and i don't know
 
00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:52.720 align:start position:0%
i'm sure they go under 18
 
00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
they may not go under 10 or under 5.
 
00:10:57.350 --> 00:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
the language
 
00:10:58.790 --> 00:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
representative gay that we're
 
00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:10.160 align:start position:0%
so i think
 
00:11:11.829 --> 00:11:11.839 align:start position:0%
if i may
 
00:11:11.839 --> 00:11:12.870 align:start position:0%
if i may
that

00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:12.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:16.160 align:start position:0%
leaving leaving rsa 151 colon 2
 
00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
reference there and then just adding any
 
00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
other facilities that we're concerned
 
00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
just saying you know pursuant to rsa 151
 
00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:24.720 align:start position:0%
colon 2 and
 
00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:26.640 align:start position:0%
and broaden it to the other facilities
 
00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:29.120 align:start position:0%
we want to add just not limiting it
 
00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:30.640 align:start position:0%
because there are a number of facilities
 
00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:32.320 align:start position:0%
under that statute that we still want it
 
00:11:34.389 --> 00:11:34.399 align:start position:0%
to apply to
 
00:11:36.949 --> 00:11:36.959 align:start position:0%
but i do like putting this all in the
 
00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:38.480 align:start position:0%
patient's bill of rights i think that's
 
00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:39.829 align:start position:0%
patient's bill of rights i think that's
great

00:11:39.829 --> 00:11:39.839 align:start position:0%
great
 
00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:42.720 align:start position:0%
and it makes sense i believe that
 
00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:44.310 align:start position:0%
and it makes sense i believe that
um

00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:44.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:46.069 --> 00:11:46.079 align:start position:0%
they're already required to post the
 
00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
patient bill of rights in these
 
00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:49.350 align:start position:0%
patient bill of rights in these
facilities

00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:49.360 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:51.120 align:start position:0%
but maybe someone from the hospital
 
00:11:52.389 --> 00:11:52.399 align:start position:0%
association or the department can
 
00:11:52.399 --> 00:11:54.069 align:start position:0%
association or the department can
clarify

00:11:54.069 --> 00:11:54.079 align:start position:0%
clarify
 
00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:56.560 align:start position:0%
paul i'm pretty sure um that they have
 
00:11:59.030 --> 00:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
to they have to be posted
 
00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:03.430 align:start position:0%
to they have to be posted
yeah

00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:04.949 --> 00:12:04.959 align:start position:0%
things have changed since i was in
 
00:12:04.959 --> 00:12:06.069 align:start position:0%
things have changed since i was in
practice

00:12:06.069 --> 00:12:06.079 align:start position:0%
practice
 
00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
the first first year i was at concord
 
00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:10.320 align:start position:0%
hospital you could buy cigarettes in the
 
00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:11.670 align:start position:0%
hospital you could buy cigarettes in the
lobby

00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:11.680 align:start position:0%
lobby
 
00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
in the lobby of the concord hospital
 
00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
i couldn't believe it
 
00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
we've changed a bit
 
00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:20.949 align:start position:0%
we've changed a bit
sorry

00:12:20.949 --> 00:12:20.959 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:23.200 align:start position:0%
i do have another question
 
00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:26.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:28.160 align:start position:0%
on under section
 
00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:30.790 align:start position:0%
on under section
6

00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:30.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:33.440 align:start position:0%
romans 6 i'm sorry
 
00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
if there were an outbreak of some kind
 
00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:38.320 align:start position:0%
say like we had in the past with mrsa
 
00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:40.480 align:start position:0%
there was a hospital that had a really a
 
00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:41.509 align:start position:0%
there was a hospital that had a really a
major

00:12:41.509 --> 00:12:41.519 align:start position:0%
major
 
00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
outbreak of mrsa
 
00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
to have any changes occur
 
00:12:48.069 --> 00:12:48.079 align:start position:0%
would require the governor or the
 
00:12:48.079 --> 00:12:49.910 align:start position:0%
would require the governor or the
legislature

00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:52.240 align:start position:0%
that seemed like a very very very slow
 
00:12:57.670 --> 00:12:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:57.680 --> 00:12:58.790 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:12:58.790 --> 00:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:01.120 align:start position:0%
is it your opinion that that would not
 
00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:05.920 align:start position:0%
be covered by the exceptions in 3
 
00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:12.629 --> 00:13:12.639 align:start position:0%
and specifically a the presence of
 
00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:14.160 align:start position:0%
visitors would be medically or
 
00:13:16.389 --> 00:13:16.399 align:start position:0%
therapeutically contraindicated in the
 
00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:18.560 align:start position:0%
best clinical judgment of health care
 
00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:21.200 align:start position:0%
professionals i think i could yeah okay
 
00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:22.480 align:start position:0%
i could yeah
 
00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:25.360 align:start position:0%
and b is the presence of visitors would
 
00:13:27.829 --> 00:13:27.839 align:start position:0%
interfere with the care or rights of any
 
00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
patient so that's where we're back to
 
00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:31.829 align:start position:0%
patient so that's where we're back to
balancing

00:13:31.829 --> 00:13:31.839 align:start position:0%
balancing
 
00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:34.240 align:start position:0%
the rights of the one versus the rights
 
00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
yeah one could interpret that i would
 
00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
agree the other ones yeah i would agree
 
00:13:39.269 --> 00:13:39.279 align:start position:0%
i could be interpreted that way i was
 
00:13:41.829 --> 00:13:41.839 align:start position:0%
just being more
 
00:13:41.839 --> 00:13:42.790 align:start position:0%
just being more
i

00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:42.800 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:44.160 align:start position:0%
if if
 
00:13:46.949 --> 00:13:46.959 align:start position:0%
if we moved it what i would prove what i
 
00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:50.720 align:start position:0%
would propose doing is simply moving
 
00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:58.790 --> 00:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
to the patient's bill of rights
 
00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
and making making three a subjection so
 
00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
that it's clearly that you know the
 
00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:06.560 align:start position:0%
children's rights is the next one on
 
00:14:08.629 --> 00:14:08.639 align:start position:0%
following all the other rights the
 
00:14:11.829 --> 00:14:11.839 align:start position:0%
adults rights of the other and those two
 
00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
paragraphs are subject to three
 
00:14:17.509 --> 00:14:17.519 align:start position:0%
and then we don't have all of the other
 
00:14:17.519 --> 00:14:20.470 align:start position:0%
and then we don't have all of the other
stuff

00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:21.269 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:14:21.269 --> 00:14:21.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:23.920 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm wondering both from from all of
 
00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
you and from all of the people out in
 
00:14:28.389 --> 00:14:28.399 align:start position:0%
the audience if if that is an approach
 
00:14:28.399 --> 00:14:30.470 align:start position:0%
the audience if if that is an approach
that

00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:32.880 align:start position:0%
might get us all a little closer to
 
00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
being on the same page rather than on
 
00:14:39.189 --> 00:14:39.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:40.629 --> 00:14:40.639 align:start position:0%
anybody out there
 
00:14:40.639 --> 00:14:52.150 align:start position:0%
anybody out there
yeah

00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:52.160 --> 00:15:10.310 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:26.790 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:26.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:42.949 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:15:42.949 --> 00:15:42.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:42.959 --> 00:15:48.389 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:15:48.389 --> 00:15:48.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:52.629 --> 00:15:52.639 align:start position:0%
and one and two are actually framed
 
00:15:55.269 --> 00:15:55.279 align:start position:0%
as being patient-centric because it is
 
00:15:58.629 --> 00:15:58.639 align:start position:0%
the minor who is admitted has the right
 
00:16:01.269 --> 00:16:01.279 align:start position:0%
and the adult who is admitted has the
 
00:16:01.279 --> 00:16:02.470 align:start position:0%
and the adult who is admitted has the
right

00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:02.480 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:16:03.829 --> 00:16:03.839 align:start position:0%
so that
 
00:16:05.749 --> 00:16:05.759 align:start position:0%
you know i can look at the language of
 
00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
the patient bill of rights a little
 
00:16:08.949 --> 00:16:08.959 align:start position:0%
closer and
 
00:16:11.829 --> 00:16:11.839 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i'm so late really picking up
 
00:16:13.749 --> 00:16:13.759 align:start position:0%
on that but when i started reading the
 
00:16:15.829 --> 00:16:15.839 align:start position:0%
patient bill of rights it it made a
 
00:16:18.629 --> 00:16:18.639 align:start position:0%
great deal more sense to me that
 
00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:20.800 align:start position:0%
this ought to be there
 
00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:22.480 align:start position:0%
and that may
 
00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:24.310 align:start position:0%
and that may
actually

00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:24.320 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
solve the issue of
 
00:16:29.749 --> 00:16:29.759 align:start position:0%
having to define which facilities it
 
00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:31.680 align:start position:0%
applies to too
 
00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:34.320 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure but anyway go ahead
 
00:16:36.949 --> 00:16:36.959 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i i would not
 
00:16:39.189 --> 00:16:39.199 align:start position:0%
support moving those three sections and
 
00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
striking the rest but i do think that we
 
00:16:43.829 --> 00:16:43.839 align:start position:0%
may want to tie something into the
 
00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:46.160 align:start position:0%
patient bill of rights referencing this
 
00:16:48.629 --> 00:16:48.639 align:start position:0%
i think that the additional information
 
00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:50.720 align:start position:0%
in here is very important
 
00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:53.440 align:start position:0%
and i'm also concerned with striking c
 
00:16:55.269 --> 00:16:55.279 align:start position:0%
in roman 8
 
00:16:59.829 --> 00:16:59.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
there are other ways in which the cdc
 
00:17:04.789 --> 00:17:04.799 align:start position:0%
and other federal guidelines can be
 
00:17:04.799 --> 00:17:06.150 align:start position:0%
and other federal guidelines can be
implemented

00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:06.160 align:start position:0%
implemented
 
00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:08.240 align:start position:0%
this makes the state an agent of the
 
00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:09.839 align:start position:0%
federal government and our departments
 
00:17:11.909 --> 00:17:11.919 align:start position:0%
an agent of the federal government and i
 
00:17:13.909 --> 00:17:13.919 align:start position:0%
don't think that that's appropriate
 
00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:16.480 align:start position:0%
and so i believe
 
00:17:19.029 --> 00:17:19.039 align:start position:0%
so i'm not in favor of striking c and i
 
00:17:22.069 --> 00:17:22.079 align:start position:0%
want to keep roman four through eight in
 
00:17:22.079 --> 00:17:23.110 align:start position:0%
want to keep roman four through eight in
there

00:17:23.110 --> 00:17:23.120 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:25.029 align:start position:0%
there
okay

00:17:25.029 --> 00:17:25.039 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:17:25.039 --> 00:17:26.150 align:start position:0%
okay
yes

00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:26.160 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:28.160 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i have just have a
 
00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
very simple question when we talk about
 
00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
patient's bill of rights
 
00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:35.440 align:start position:0%
our patients rights
 
00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
for a child does that mean the child's
 
00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
rights are expressed as expressed by the
 
00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:41.350 align:start position:0%
rights are expressed as expressed by the
parents

00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:41.360 align:start position:0%
parents
 
00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
do the parents have the same rights
 
00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
as the child
 
00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:47.360 align:start position:0%
their child the patient
 
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:50.080 align:start position:0%
patients rights apply to all patients
 
00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:56.710 --> 00:17:56.720 align:start position:0%
desires expressed
 
00:17:59.029 --> 00:17:59.039 align:start position:0%
by their parents okay so that is
 
00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
illegally the same
 
00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to give you a legal
 
00:18:03.909 --> 00:18:03.919 align:start position:0%
opinion representative that's what it
 
00:18:07.909 --> 00:18:07.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:10.480 align:start position:0%
thank you uh so
 
00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:12.640 align:start position:0%
representative i'm just uh a li i don't
 
00:18:14.789 --> 00:18:14.799 align:start position:0%
follow you on on number on roman numeral
 
00:18:14.799 --> 00:18:15.830 align:start position:0%
follow you on on number on roman numeral
8c

00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
8c
 
00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:16.870 align:start position:0%
8c
so

00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:16.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:19.360 align:start position:0%
the way i read it it's saying
 
00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:20.470 align:start position:0%
the way i read it it's saying
that

00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:20.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:25.760 align:start position:0%
they're not required
 
00:18:27.669 --> 00:18:27.679 align:start position:0%
to follow the guidelines of the cdc or
 
00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:29.440 align:start position:0%
other federal guidelines
 
00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:30.720 align:start position:0%
and that
 
00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:32.549 align:start position:0%
and that
action

00:18:32.549 --> 00:18:32.559 align:start position:0%
action
 
00:18:32.559 --> 00:18:33.830 align:start position:0%
action
can

00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:34.870 align:start position:0%
can
sorry

00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:34.880 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:36.480 align:start position:0%
well what i would there's a lot if you
 
00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:38.240 align:start position:0%
start there's a lot in there but if you
 
00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
start at the beginning of
 
00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:45.440 align:start position:0%
paragraph eight it says unless expressly
 
00:18:49.909 --> 00:18:49.919 align:start position:0%
required by federal law or regulation
 
00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
comma the department
 
00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:54.160 align:start position:0%
shall not take any action
 
00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
arising out of this section against a
 
00:18:58.310 --> 00:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
healthcare facility for
 
00:18:58.320 --> 00:18:59.909 align:start position:0%
healthcare facility for
so

00:18:59.909 --> 00:18:59.919 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
we've already said unless expressly
 
00:19:05.029 --> 00:19:05.039 align:start position:0%
required by federal law or regulation if
 
00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
we then say they can't do it to follow
 
00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
federal law of regulation
 
00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:13.200 align:start position:0%
then we've created a
 
00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:15.440 align:start position:0%
a conflict right in the language of the
 
00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
statute i chose to take out c
 
00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:22.960 align:start position:0%
because i am on the side of wanting us
 
00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:26.480 align:start position:0%
to comply with cmc guidelines
 
00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:28.400 align:start position:0%
we've already had that discussion we
 
00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:30.640 align:start position:0%
don't all agree on that
 
00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:32.640 align:start position:0%
but i was drafting it so i got to leave
 
00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:35.360 align:start position:0%
in the piece i liked
 
00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:37.360 align:start position:0%
if if somebody wants to do it another
 
00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:40.320 align:start position:0%
way that's fine but
 
00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
what i'm
 
00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
beginning to hear is that there isn't
 
00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:48.240 align:start position:0%
a lot of room for agreement here and i
 
00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:51.440 align:start position:0%
want to know whether that's the case or
 
00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
whether we should continue to push
 
00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:55.120 align:start position:0%
forward and try and draft something that
 
00:19:58.070 --> 00:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
we can all agree on
 
00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:00.480 align:start position:0%
mike my question with those is because
 
00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:02.960 align:start position:0%
guidelines are not a regulation so if
 
00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:04.720 align:start position:0%
there's a regulation to follow the
 
00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:07.360 align:start position:0%
guidelines then that's something that
 
00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
that where they could take action but
 
00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
otherwise you're promoting the
 
00:20:12.789 --> 00:20:12.799 align:start position:0%
guidelines as something that that's
 
00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:14.960 align:start position:0%
stronger than it is i do know that back
 
00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:16.720 align:start position:0%
when cigarettes were in the hospital
 
00:20:18.549 --> 00:20:18.559 align:start position:0%
cigarettes were recommended for nausea
 
00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:19.840 align:start position:0%
for women and that was part of
 
00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:23.360 align:start position:0%
guidelines pregnant women so
 
00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:24.400 align:start position:0%
we just want to make sure that
 
00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
guidelines regulations and laws aren't
 
00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:28.480 align:start position:0%
confused too much
 
00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:30.400 align:start position:0%
but if this becomes the one discussion
 
00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:32.320 align:start position:0%
point we can always look to
 
00:20:34.149 --> 00:20:34.159 align:start position:0%
bringing it with and without that are
 
00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
you are you
 
00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:38.400 align:start position:0%
interested in pursuing one where we have
 
00:20:39.909 --> 00:20:39.919 align:start position:0%
all of these sections are you looking
 
00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
only to trim it to the part the one
 
00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:44.320 align:start position:0%
through three and the guidelines
 
00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
i would absolutely prefer to take one
 
00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:50.960 align:start position:0%
through three and put them in
 
00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
the patient's bill of rights
 
00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:56.080 align:start position:0%
and leave it there
 
00:20:58.310 --> 00:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
but what we could do
 
00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
was we could do
 
00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:02.390 align:start position:0%
was we could do
one

00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:02.400 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:21:05.029 --> 00:21:05.039 align:start position:0%
amendment that does that which i think
 
00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:07.600 align:start position:0%
we're all pretty much agreed on
 
00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
and then there might be a further
 
00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
amendment which moves
 
00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:14.000 align:start position:0%
other things to somewhere else
 
00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:16.880 align:start position:0%
would that be an approach um i i think
 
00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:18.720 align:start position:0%
maybe the competing amendments might be
 
00:21:20.549 --> 00:21:20.559 align:start position:0%
an approach if you wanted to work on the
 
00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:22.400 align:start position:0%
one of moving to the patient's bill of
 
00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
rights just with sections one through
 
00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:26.320 align:start position:0%
three i can take the lead on retaining
 
00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:27.760 align:start position:0%
these different sections and figuring
 
00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
out the best way to make that work okay
 
00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:31.909 align:start position:0%
out the best way to make that work okay
so

00:21:31.909 --> 00:21:31.919 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:21:31.919 --> 00:21:33.669 align:start position:0%
so
yep

00:21:33.669 --> 00:21:33.679 align:start position:0%
yep
 
00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
you just turned it off sorry to be a
 
00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:36.390 align:start position:0%
you just turned it off sorry to be a
stickler

00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:36.400 align:start position:0%
stickler
 
00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:38.720 align:start position:0%
i'm still concerned about um
 
00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:40.400 align:start position:0%
roman 3a
 
00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:44.240 align:start position:0%
um yes i believe that it allows the
 
00:21:45.669 --> 00:21:45.679 align:start position:0%
facilities to
 
00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:48.480 align:start position:0%
at any time bar visitors and
 
00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:49.270 align:start position:0%
at any time bar visitors and
that

00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:49.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:53.120 align:start position:0%
you know completely eliminates the bill
 
00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:55.440 align:start position:0%
you know and its application
 
00:21:57.029 --> 00:21:57.039 align:start position:0%
representative woods
 
00:21:58.710 --> 00:21:58.720 align:start position:0%
by the same token
 
00:22:00.149 --> 00:22:00.159 align:start position:0%
a lot a lot of times these are very
 
00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:02.480 align:start position:0%
emotional times
 
00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:04.000 align:start position:0%
and the
 
00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.110 align:start position:0%
and the
patients

00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
patients
 
00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:07.280 align:start position:0%
families do want to be with them and i
 
00:22:09.669 --> 00:22:09.679 align:start position:0%
understand that but trust me
 
00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:11.200 align:start position:0%
it is not
 
00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
good medical practice
 
00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
to let the patient have the upper hand
 
00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
in getting into
 
00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:22.720 align:start position:0%
questionable situations it's just not
 
00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
it's just
 
00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:27.200 align:start position:0%
it's not in the patient's best interest
 
00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
let's say you have a compound fracture
 
00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:32.240 align:start position:0%
well here here's a situation
 
00:22:34.789 --> 00:22:34.799 align:start position:0%
a 16 year old girl gets wrapped up in a
 
00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:37.360 align:start position:0%
tree three broken limbs and her skulls
 
00:22:39.430 --> 00:22:39.440 align:start position:0%
wide open i happen to be the first one
 
00:22:40.549 --> 00:22:40.559 align:start position:0%
on the scene
 
00:22:42.149 --> 00:22:42.159 align:start position:0%
she's from concord
 
00:22:43.909 --> 00:22:43.919 align:start position:0%
family was surprised that she was on the
 
00:22:45.909 --> 00:22:45.919 align:start position:0%
way to the hospital wanted to come in to
 
00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:47.440 align:start position:0%
see her
 
00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:49.280 align:start position:0%
that is not the time for the family to
 
00:22:50.549 --> 00:22:50.559 align:start position:0%
come in when i'm
 
00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
happen to be the first one the trauma
 
00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:54.480 align:start position:0%
surgeons were right behind me
 
00:22:56.950 --> 00:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
but that is not the time to have the
 
00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:58.149 align:start position:0%
but that is not the time to have the
family

00:22:58.149 --> 00:22:58.159 align:start position:0%
family
 
00:22:59.350 --> 00:22:59.360 align:start position:0%
come in
 
00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
because they'll faint
 
00:23:03.029 --> 00:23:03.039 align:start position:0%
well i've had that have i've had doctors
 
00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
faint when i set a fracture so it's not
 
00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:06.390 align:start position:0%
faint when i set a fracture so it's not
just

00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:06.400 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:07.110 align:start position:0%
just
but

00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:07.120 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:11.200 align:start position:0%
i think it's uh to to i understand uh
 
00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
leah's concern
 
00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
but i think in terms of patient care
 
00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
uh that i i think
 
00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:20.000 align:start position:0%
um making it such that the family could
 
00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:22.880 align:start position:0%
come in at any time uh would be
 
00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
contraindicated it's just uh
 
00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:27.520 align:start position:0%
i understand the concern
 
00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
and i i agree that and there are going
 
00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:31.120 align:start position:0%
to be some there's going to be some
 
00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:34.480 align:start position:0%
doctors and nurses that uh and you your
 
00:23:36.149 --> 00:23:36.159 align:start position:0%
nurse you you know there's some nurses
 
00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:38.480 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't be so kindly
 
00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:40.320 align:start position:0%
and we have to deal with that but i
 
00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:42.240 align:start position:0%
think in this particular situation i
 
00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:43.029 align:start position:0%
think in this particular situation i
think

00:23:43.029 --> 00:23:43.039 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:23:45.750 --> 00:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
we really are talking patient care
 
00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:47.440 align:start position:0%
in this particular situation and the
 
00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
patient has to come first
 
00:23:51.190 --> 00:23:51.200 align:start position:0%
and thank you representative and i would
 
00:23:53.269 --> 00:23:53.279 align:start position:0%
agree with you um so maybe there's some
 
00:23:56.230 --> 00:23:56.240 align:start position:0%
way that we can clarify you know that
 
00:23:59.110 --> 00:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
in certain for procedures and you know
 
00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:01.520 align:start position:0%
in certain trauma situations
 
00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:02.230 align:start position:0%
in certain trauma situations
but

00:24:02.230 --> 00:24:02.240 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:24:05.029 --> 00:24:05.039 align:start position:0%
my concern is that you know case cases
 
00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
of covert go up
 
00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:08.960 align:start position:0%
um and reach a certain number and
 
00:24:10.390 --> 00:24:10.400 align:start position:0%
immediately they shut out all family
 
00:24:11.669 --> 00:24:11.679 align:start position:0%
members and people are dying alone in
 
00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:13.440 align:start position:0%
the hospitals again rules are meant to
 
00:24:17.029 --> 00:24:17.039 align:start position:0%
be broken and that's just so i mean and
 
00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
people are i'm sorry i'm for
 
00:24:22.149 --> 00:24:22.159 align:start position:0%
interjecting and can you right a little
 
00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:24.640 align:start position:0%
closer to your microphone i i
 
00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
i completely agree and
 
00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:29.440 align:start position:0%
i i understand that there are going to
 
00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:31.120 align:start position:0%
be some you know
 
00:24:33.269 --> 00:24:33.279 align:start position:0%
personnel in the facilities that
 
00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:35.360 align:start position:0%
wouldn't make the decisions that should
 
00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:37.360 align:start position:0%
be made but i think we have to err on
 
00:24:39.269 --> 00:24:39.279 align:start position:0%
the side of making sure that patients
 
00:24:41.430 --> 00:24:41.440 align:start position:0%
are taken care of well the other thing
 
00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:43.600 align:start position:0%
is that i think we need to be very clear
 
00:24:45.909 --> 00:24:45.919 align:start position:0%
and i think that representative cushman
 
00:24:48.789 --> 00:24:48.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
this was not a reaction to wanting
 
00:24:53.909 --> 00:24:53.919 align:start position:0%
somebody with the patient every single
 
00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
minute of every single day with the
 
00:24:57.430 --> 00:24:57.440 align:start position:0%
possible exception of a dying patient
 
00:24:59.110 --> 00:24:59.120 align:start position:0%
who is not getting a lot of medical
 
00:25:01.269 --> 00:25:01.279 align:start position:0%
procedures they need somebody to come
 
00:25:03.430 --> 00:25:03.440 align:start position:0%
and sit and hold their hand quietly in a
 
00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:04.950 align:start position:0%
and sit and hold their hand quietly in a
corner

00:25:04.950 --> 00:25:04.960 align:start position:0%
corner
 
00:25:07.510 --> 00:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
as opposed to somebody who has an open
 
00:25:10.789 --> 00:25:10.799 align:start position:0%
fracture that needs to be dealt with
 
00:25:13.350 --> 00:25:13.360 align:start position:0%
i didn't get the sense that anybody was
 
00:25:15.669 --> 00:25:15.679 align:start position:0%
saying that somebody needs to be there
 
00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
every single minute of the day i think
 
00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:19.520 align:start position:0%
the thing that they were
 
00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:22.240 align:start position:0%
worried about was not having the
 
00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
equivalent of normal visiting hours
 
00:25:27.430 --> 00:25:27.440 align:start position:0%
where you could come in
 
00:25:30.149 --> 00:25:30.159 align:start position:0%
see your patient
 
00:25:32.149 --> 00:25:32.159 align:start position:0%
you know and and
 
00:25:34.390 --> 00:25:34.400 align:start position:0%
comfort them and be with them and
 
00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:36.880 align:start position:0%
encourage them to the extent
 
00:25:38.390 --> 00:25:38.400 align:start position:0%
possible it
 
00:25:42.549 --> 00:25:42.559 align:start position:0%
i didn't ever see this as a guarantee
 
00:25:44.390 --> 00:25:44.400 align:start position:0%
that anybody could be anywhere at any
 
00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:46.480 align:start position:0%
time because that's just
 
00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:48.240 align:start position:0%
as far as i'm concerned that's just
 
00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:49.510 align:start position:0%
as far as i'm concerned that's just
madness

00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:49.520 align:start position:0%
madness
 
00:25:51.269 --> 00:25:51.279 align:start position:0%
because there are times when there are
 
00:25:52.789 --> 00:25:52.799 align:start position:0%
procedures and
 
00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:54.320 align:start position:0%
i do think that we need to be
 
00:25:56.390 --> 00:25:56.400 align:start position:0%
particularly careful with the
 
00:25:58.230 --> 00:25:58.240 align:start position:0%
matter of children who need
 
00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:00.720 align:start position:0%
a trusted adult with them at almost
 
00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:02.640 align:start position:0%
every time and particularly when things
 
00:26:04.149 --> 00:26:04.159 align:start position:0%
are scary
 
00:26:04.159 --> 00:26:05.590 align:start position:0%
are scary
and

00:26:05.590 --> 00:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:08.080 align:start position:0%
there's already the very definite
 
00:26:09.909 --> 00:26:09.919 align:start position:0%
provision in the patient's bill of
 
00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:13.440 align:start position:0%
rights about patients who are dying so
 
00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:16.149 align:start position:0%
rights about patients who are dying so
um

00:26:16.149 --> 00:26:16.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:19.520 align:start position:0%
i think maybe yeah go ahead
 
00:26:38.789 --> 00:26:38.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:38.799 --> 00:27:27.350 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:42.710 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:27:42.710 --> 00:27:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:59.830 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:27:59.830 --> 00:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:02.960 align:start position:0%
thank you i think that maybe one path
 
00:28:05.669 --> 00:28:05.679 align:start position:0%
forward is making it so that the agent
 
00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:07.440 align:start position:0%
for a durable power of attorney or
 
00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:08.470 align:start position:0%
for a durable power of attorney or
surrogate

00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:08.480 align:start position:0%
surrogate
 
00:28:11.190 --> 00:28:11.200 align:start position:0%
has more access even in those situations
 
00:28:12.870 --> 00:28:12.880 align:start position:0%
so that if the patient
 
00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:13.669 align:start position:0%
so that if the patient
is

00:28:13.669 --> 00:28:13.679 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:28:14.950 --> 00:28:14.960 align:start position:0%
unable to make their own health care
 
00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
decisions their their trusted person is
 
00:28:19.990 --> 00:28:20.000 align:start position:0%
able to have access to the greatest
 
00:28:23.269 --> 00:28:23.279 align:start position:0%
extent possible in those scenarios
 
00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
so that's that
 
00:28:26.950 --> 00:28:26.960 align:start position:0%
if that seems reasonable i will work
 
00:28:28.710 --> 00:28:28.720 align:start position:0%
towards getting that into the amendment
 
00:28:30.389 --> 00:28:30.399 align:start position:0%
that i'll be working on
 
00:28:32.470 --> 00:28:32.480 align:start position:0%
my concern with that is that the person
 
00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:34.240 align:start position:0%
who is your durable power of attorney
 
00:28:36.310 --> 00:28:36.320 align:start position:0%
for health care is not always the the
 
00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
nearest and dearest in the person that
 
00:28:39.029 --> 00:28:39.039 align:start position:0%
you want
 
00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:41.440 align:start position:0%
right there all the time
 
00:28:42.870 --> 00:28:42.880 align:start position:0%
that's true but if they're going to be
 
00:28:44.389 --> 00:28:44.399 align:start position:0%
making health care decisions and you
 
00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
have a patient on a ventilator and
 
00:28:47.909 --> 00:28:47.919 align:start position:0%
nobody can see them
 
00:28:49.750 --> 00:28:49.760 align:start position:0%
if you need to default to somebody it
 
00:28:51.990 --> 00:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
should be that person who's chose who is
 
00:28:53.909 --> 00:28:53.919 align:start position:0%
able to make those decisions
 
00:28:55.990 --> 00:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
maybe a separate carve out but the
 
00:28:57.190 --> 00:28:57.200 align:start position:0%
health care
 
00:28:59.350 --> 00:28:59.360 align:start position:0%
agent already has the power to make
 
00:29:00.789 --> 00:29:00.799 align:start position:0%
those decisions
 
00:29:02.549 --> 00:29:02.559 align:start position:0%
under the under the
 
00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:04.320 align:start position:0%
power that they've been given that's
 
00:29:06.389 --> 00:29:06.399 align:start position:0%
that's what they do they're able to be
 
00:29:09.029 --> 00:29:09.039 align:start position:0%
in person even during covet no they're
 
00:29:12.149 --> 00:29:12.159 align:start position:0%
they're there to make decisions for the
 
00:29:14.389 --> 00:29:14.399 align:start position:0%
person but it is a totally different
 
00:29:14.399 --> 00:29:15.750 align:start position:0%
person but it is a totally different
function

00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:15.760 align:start position:0%
function
 
00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:27.760 align:start position:0%
the person i've picked as my durable
 
00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:30.240 align:start position:0%
power of attorney is my agent
 
00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
is my stepson because he's here
 
00:29:36.789 --> 00:29:36.799 align:start position:0%
but if my sister arrived
 
00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
she would be the person
 
00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:45.760 align:start position:0%
i would want to be with me as opposed to
 
00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:48.080 align:start position:0%
the decision maker i mean there are lots
 
00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:50.320 align:start position:0%
of they're just two completely different
 
00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:51.350 align:start position:0%
of they're just two completely different
functions

00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:51.360 align:start position:0%
functions
 
00:29:54.950 --> 00:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
and i think that for purposes of this
 
00:29:58.070 --> 00:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
we need to focus
 
00:29:58.080 --> 00:29:58.950 align:start position:0%
we need to focus
on

00:29:58.950 --> 00:29:58.960 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:30:01.430 --> 00:30:01.440 align:start position:0%
the person that's closest to the patient
 
00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:02.389 align:start position:0%
the person that's closest to the patient
and

00:30:02.389 --> 00:30:02.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:30:04.789 --> 00:30:04.799 align:start position:0%
the other thing is that gazillions of
 
00:30:06.870 --> 00:30:06.880 align:start position:0%
people don't fill out durable powers of
 
00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:08.480 align:start position:0%
attorney for health care reforms
 
00:30:10.870 --> 00:30:10.880 align:start position:0%
gazillions of people do
 
00:30:13.350 --> 00:30:13.360 align:start position:0%
and i certainly have had the experience
 
00:30:15.029 --> 00:30:15.039 align:start position:0%
and i'll bet
 
00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:19.360 align:start position:0%
that representative cushman has too
 
00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:20.230 align:start position:0%
that representative cushman has too
my

00:30:20.230 --> 00:30:20.240 align:start position:0%
my
 
00:30:23.190 --> 00:30:23.200 align:start position:0%
aunt had a living will because durable
 
00:30:25.029 --> 00:30:25.039 align:start position:0%
powers of attorney hadn't been invented
 
00:30:27.110 --> 00:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
and she said that she absolutely didn't
 
00:30:29.029 --> 00:30:29.039 align:start position:0%
want to have any interventions of any
 
00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:31.440 align:start position:0%
kind and she absolutely said she didn't
 
00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
want to leave her home
 
00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:33.990 align:start position:0%
want to leave her home
but

00:30:33.990 --> 00:30:34.000 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:30:36.549 --> 00:30:36.559 align:start position:0%
when she was in her last
 
00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:39.360 align:start position:0%
episode of her last illness
 
00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:42.080 align:start position:0%
she asked to be taken to the hospital
 
00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:45.200 align:start position:0%
she voluntarily agreed to several
 
00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:48.720 align:start position:0%
extremely invasive diagnostic procedures
 
00:30:51.269 --> 00:30:51.279 align:start position:0%
and it wasn't until she got weak enough
 
00:30:53.269 --> 00:30:53.279 align:start position:0%
that she could not speak anymore that
 
00:30:54.950 --> 00:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
somebody called me and said what do we
 
00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:56.240 align:start position:0%
do now
 
00:30:58.389 --> 00:30:58.399 align:start position:0%
and i was faced with somebody who had
 
00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:00.240 align:start position:0%
said very firmly that she didn't want
 
00:31:03.269 --> 00:31:03.279 align:start position:0%
anything but more close in time she had
 
00:31:05.190 --> 00:31:05.200 align:start position:0%
said yes please
 
00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
i want to go to the hospital i will
 
00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:08.230 align:start position:0%
i want to go to the hospital i will
consent

00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:08.240 align:start position:0%
consent
 
00:31:10.950 --> 00:31:10.960 align:start position:0%
and so i felt that i was bound at that
 
00:31:13.029 --> 00:31:13.039 align:start position:0%
point to honor what seemed to me to be
 
00:31:15.110 --> 00:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
her closest in time wishes because
 
00:31:17.350 --> 00:31:17.360 align:start position:0%
that's what she wanted to do
 
00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:19.430 align:start position:0%
that's what she wanted to do
and

00:31:19.430 --> 00:31:19.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:31:25.029 --> 00:31:25.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:26.870 --> 00:31:26.880 align:start position:0%
i mean what we really want is for people
 
00:31:29.269 --> 00:31:29.279 align:start position:0%
to be really thoughtful and
 
00:31:31.350 --> 00:31:31.360 align:start position:0%
working the best they can to honor what
 
00:31:33.029 --> 00:31:33.039 align:start position:0%
somebody wants sometimes you can't tell
 
00:31:33.039 --> 00:31:33.909 align:start position:0%
somebody wants sometimes you can't tell
but

00:31:33.909 --> 00:31:33.919 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:31:36.470 --> 00:31:36.480 align:start position:0%
yeah go ahead thank you uh is there any
 
00:31:39.669 --> 00:31:39.679 align:start position:0%
way to write that in as an amendment no
 
00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
so that you can have a choice of
 
00:31:43.110 --> 00:31:43.120 align:start position:0%
somebody no
 
00:31:45.830 --> 00:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
no we really need to focus on one thing
 
00:31:48.549 --> 00:31:48.559 align:start position:0%
or another thing but i mean that is our
 
00:31:51.110 --> 00:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
concern is how we treat people
 
00:31:53.269 --> 00:31:53.279 align:start position:0%
then not leave them isolated so how do
 
00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:54.720 align:start position:0%
we spell out
 
00:31:56.470 --> 00:31:56.480 align:start position:0%
if we're not going to have a crowd come
 
00:31:57.990 --> 00:31:58.000 align:start position:0%
in and visit
 
00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:00.880 align:start position:0%
but under really crisis situations
 
00:32:03.509 --> 00:32:03.519 align:start position:0%
people do need somebody well this
 
00:32:06.149 --> 00:32:06.159 align:start position:0%
already says that they say a person i
 
00:32:08.230 --> 00:32:08.240 align:start position:0%
mean it's already in there but we don't
 
00:32:10.950 --> 00:32:10.960 align:start position:0%
want to spell out that the person is
 
00:32:13.909 --> 00:32:13.919 align:start position:0%
the two people that you i don't i won't
 
00:32:16.710 --> 00:32:16.720 align:start position:0%
speak for anybody else you defined two
 
00:32:19.029 --> 00:32:19.039 align:start position:0%
people who are critical one who makes
 
00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:21.200 align:start position:0%
decisions and one who is a strong
 
00:32:22.950 --> 00:32:22.960 align:start position:0%
emotional support
 
00:32:25.350 --> 00:32:25.360 align:start position:0%
so it seems like
 
00:32:27.269 --> 00:32:27.279 align:start position:0%
you know since we're talking about
 
00:32:29.350 --> 00:32:29.360 align:start position:0%
crisis situations where nobody is
 
00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:31.200 align:start position:0%
permitted to come in
 
00:32:33.909 --> 00:32:33.919 align:start position:0%
that we ought to spell out who can
 
00:32:33.919 --> 00:32:34.630 align:start position:0%
that we ought to spell out who can
because

00:32:34.630 --> 00:32:34.640 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:32:36.870 --> 00:32:36.880 align:start position:0%
that was my question is under what
 
00:32:39.190 --> 00:32:39.200 align:start position:0%
circumstances yeah and if that was my
 
00:32:41.190 --> 00:32:41.200 align:start position:0%
child with
 
00:32:43.190 --> 00:32:43.200 align:start position:0%
three broken limbs and a gash on their
 
00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:44.149 align:start position:0%
three broken limbs and a gash on their
head

00:32:44.149 --> 00:32:44.159 align:start position:0%
head
 
00:32:45.990 --> 00:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
and they were still conscious
 
00:32:47.669 --> 00:32:47.679 align:start position:0%
i would want to see
 
00:32:50.710 --> 00:32:50.720 align:start position:0%
see my child even if it was momentarily
 
00:32:52.630 --> 00:32:52.640 align:start position:0%
so people could be stitching her up and
 
00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:54.840 align:start position:0%
setting setting bones i'd still like to
 
00:32:57.509 --> 00:32:57.519 align:start position:0%
reassure i'm here
 
00:32:59.029 --> 00:32:59.039 align:start position:0%
i apologize i have to get to another
 
00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:02.080 align:start position:0%
meeting um i'm going to
 
00:33:04.389 --> 00:33:04.399 align:start position:0%
recess i i will
 
00:33:06.070 --> 00:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
we can have a discussion about whether
 
00:33:07.269 --> 00:33:07.279 align:start position:0%
we're going to meet again i'm not
 
00:33:10.149 --> 00:33:10.159 align:start position:0%
entirely sure we are and so far we have
 
00:33:12.310 --> 00:33:12.320 align:start position:0%
not reached a complete conclusion and
 
00:33:15.350 --> 00:33:15.360 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry about that but these are
 
00:33:19.509 --> 00:33:19.519 align:start position:0%
truly tough and difficult issues so
 
00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
with that i will close the subcommittee
 
00:33:24.389 --> 00:33:24.399 align:start position:0%
meeting and let people get to their
 
01:01:03.589 --> 01:01:03.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:03.599 --> 01:01:13.430 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:01:13.430 --> 01:01:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:15.270 --> 01:01:15.280 align:start position:0%
okay good morning mr chairman and
 
01:01:17.430 --> 01:01:17.440 align:start position:0%
members of the committee
 
01:01:19.190 --> 01:01:19.200 align:start position:0%
we all know that issues of gender
 
01:01:21.910 --> 01:01:21.920 align:start position:0%
identity are constantly evolving and
 
01:01:24.390 --> 01:01:24.400 align:start position:0%
being debated around the country in many
 
01:01:25.990 --> 01:01:26.000 align:start position:0%
areas of life
 
01:01:28.390 --> 01:01:28.400 align:start position:0%
my bill does not seek to settle or put a
 
01:01:30.309 --> 01:01:30.319 align:start position:0%
stop to that debate
 
01:01:33.510 --> 01:01:33.520 align:start position:0%
what it does do is clarify and preserve
 
01:01:35.030 --> 01:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
the status quo
 
01:01:38.630 --> 01:01:38.640 align:start position:0%
in a limited but significant way i and
 
01:01:41.510 --> 01:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
the women co-sponsors of this bill
 
01:01:44.549 --> 01:01:44.559 align:start position:0%
seek to clarify and codify that in
 
01:01:46.470 --> 01:01:46.480 align:start position:0%
certain contexts
 
01:01:48.150 --> 01:01:48.160 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire has a
 
01:01:50.630 --> 01:01:50.640 align:start position:0%
rational interest in differentiating
 
01:01:53.829 --> 01:01:53.839 align:start position:0%
between the male and female biological
 
01:01:53.839 --> 01:01:55.109 align:start position:0%
between the male and female biological
sexes

01:01:55.109 --> 01:01:55.119 align:start position:0%
sexes
 
01:01:57.270 --> 01:01:57.280 align:start position:0%
this is something that in new hampshire
 
01:01:59.190 --> 01:01:59.200 align:start position:0%
we already do every day
 
01:02:01.670 --> 01:02:01.680 align:start position:0%
for example the police routinely
 
01:02:04.150 --> 01:02:04.160 align:start position:0%
incarcerate men and women in separate
 
01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:06.069 align:start position:0%
incarcerate men and women in separate
facilities

01:02:06.069 --> 01:02:06.079 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
01:02:07.910 --> 01:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
this is something we all take for
 
01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:09.029 align:start position:0%
this is something we all take for
granted

01:02:09.029 --> 01:02:09.039 align:start position:0%
granted
 
01:02:10.630 --> 01:02:10.640 align:start position:0%
but i'd ask the members of this
 
01:02:13.510 --> 01:02:13.520 align:start position:0%
committee to pause for a moment
 
01:02:15.430 --> 01:02:15.440 align:start position:0%
and contemplate how unique this
 
01:02:17.270 --> 01:02:17.280 align:start position:0%
phenomenon is
 
01:02:19.589 --> 01:02:19.599 align:start position:0%
remember that our country guarantees
 
01:02:21.990 --> 01:02:22.000 align:start position:0%
equal protection under the law
 
01:02:24.150 --> 01:02:24.160 align:start position:0%
the government can't take people of
 
01:02:25.990 --> 01:02:26.000 align:start position:0%
different races and nationalities for
 
01:02:28.069 --> 01:02:28.079 align:start position:0%
example and incarcerate them in
 
01:02:29.910 --> 01:02:29.920 align:start position:0%
different facilities
 
01:02:31.589 --> 01:02:31.599 align:start position:0%
but because of the deep
 
01:02:33.670 --> 01:02:33.680 align:start position:0%
biological differences
 
01:02:36.710 --> 01:02:36.720 align:start position:0%
that exist between the male male and
 
01:02:39.829 --> 01:02:39.839 align:start position:0%
female sexes it's been implied that our
 
01:02:41.190 --> 01:02:41.200 align:start position:0%
state has
 
01:02:43.510 --> 01:02:43.520 align:start position:0%
for a long time claimed certain
 
01:02:45.829 --> 01:02:45.839 align:start position:0%
interests in differentiating between
 
01:02:48.390 --> 01:02:48.400 align:start position:0%
these two groups of people most
 
01:02:50.549 --> 01:02:50.559 align:start position:0%
important among those interests to my
 
01:02:52.710 --> 01:02:52.720 align:start position:0%
mind are women's rights and the
 
01:02:54.710 --> 01:02:54.720 align:start position:0%
protection of women
 
01:02:57.430 --> 01:02:57.440 align:start position:0%
this is because of the unique physical
 
01:03:00.710 --> 01:03:00.720 align:start position:0%
vulnerabilities that women have
 
01:03:03.190 --> 01:03:03.200 align:start position:0%
statutory clarification is important
 
01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:04.230 align:start position:0%
statutory clarification is important
because

01:03:04.230 --> 01:03:04.240 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:03:06.390 --> 01:03:06.400 align:start position:0%
already new hampshire's laws about
 
01:03:08.950 --> 01:03:08.960 align:start position:0%
gender identity are being abused and
 
01:03:11.270 --> 01:03:11.280 align:start position:0%
stretched way beyond the meaning which i
 
01:03:13.829 --> 01:03:13.839 align:start position:0%
believe the legislature intended
 
01:03:16.470 --> 01:03:16.480 align:start position:0%
last year the manchester school board
 
01:03:19.430 --> 01:03:19.440 align:start position:0%
adopted a policy integrating biological
 
01:03:22.470 --> 01:03:22.480 align:start position:0%
males and females in both sports teams
 
01:03:25.510 --> 01:03:25.520 align:start position:0%
and bathrooms on the basis of gender
 
01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:27.190 align:start position:0%
and bathrooms on the basis of gender
identity

01:03:27.190 --> 01:03:27.200 align:start position:0%
identity
 
01:03:29.430 --> 01:03:29.440 align:start position:0%
one of the justifications given for this
 
01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:30.549 align:start position:0%
one of the justifications given for this
policy

01:03:30.549 --> 01:03:30.559 align:start position:0%
policy
 
01:03:33.390 --> 01:03:33.400 align:start position:0%
was our state law allowing
 
01:03:36.470 --> 01:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
non-binary gender identities on driver's
 
01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:38.069 align:start position:0%
non-binary gender identities on driver's
licenses

licenses
 
01:03:40.150 --> 01:03:40.160 align:start position:0%
and this is what actually alerted me to
 
01:03:41.910 --> 01:03:41.920 align:start position:0%
this problem
 
01:03:44.710 --> 01:03:44.720 align:start position:0%
now whether or not you agree that what
 
01:03:46.470 --> 01:03:46.480 align:start position:0%
the manchester school what the
 
01:03:48.390 --> 01:03:48.400 align:start position:0%
manchester school board did this is the
 
01:03:50.549 --> 01:03:50.559 align:start position:0%
misreading and an abuse of our current
 
01:03:50.559 --> 01:03:51.670 align:start position:0%
misreading and an abuse of our current
laws

01:03:51.670 --> 01:03:51.680 align:start position:0%
laws
 
01:03:54.309 --> 01:03:54.319 align:start position:0%
our state laws simply do not require
 
01:03:56.470 --> 01:03:56.480 align:start position:0%
these kinds of policies
 
01:03:59.670 --> 01:03:59.680 align:start position:0%
our state laws on gender identity
 
01:04:02.069 --> 01:04:02.079 align:start position:0%
such as our law allowing people to put
 
01:04:04.390 --> 01:04:04.400 align:start position:0%
an x on their driver's license
 
01:04:07.589 --> 01:04:07.599 align:start position:0%
do not say or mean that school districts
 
01:04:10.549 --> 01:04:10.559 align:start position:0%
are prohibited from having intramural
 
01:04:12.789 --> 01:04:12.799 align:start position:0%
and interscholastic sports leagues
 
01:04:16.309 --> 01:04:16.319 align:start position:0%
composed of biological women
 
01:04:19.270 --> 01:04:19.280 align:start position:0%
the point of my bill is narrow
 
01:04:22.390 --> 01:04:22.400 align:start position:0%
to clarify that laws regarding state
 
01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:23.990 align:start position:0%
to clarify that laws regarding state
identification

01:04:23.990 --> 01:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
identification
 
01:04:27.349 --> 01:04:27.359 align:start position:0%
do not mean that public entities
 
01:04:30.230 --> 01:04:30.240 align:start position:0%
are prohibited from differentiating
 
01:04:32.789 --> 01:04:32.799 align:start position:0%
between males and females in athletic
 
01:04:32.799 --> 01:04:34.950 align:start position:0%
between males and females in athletic
competitions

01:04:34.950 --> 01:04:34.960 align:start position:0%
competitions
 
01:04:38.230 --> 01:04:38.240 align:start position:0%
criminal incarceration or places of
 
01:04:41.510 --> 01:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
private intimacy like bathrooms
 
01:04:44.950 --> 01:04:44.960 align:start position:0%
male and female are real categories of
 
01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:45.990 align:start position:0%
male and female are real categories of
people

01:04:45.990 --> 01:04:46.000 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:04:50.150 --> 01:04:50.160 align:start position:0%
which the state can recognize
 
01:04:52.549 --> 01:04:52.559 align:start position:0%
having explained what my bill does i'd
 
01:04:54.789 --> 01:04:54.799 align:start position:0%
like to give some specifics about why i
 
01:04:56.710 --> 01:04:56.720 align:start position:0%
believe these clarifications are
 
01:04:56.720 --> 01:04:58.150 align:start position:0%
believe these clarifications are
important

01:04:58.150 --> 01:04:58.160 align:start position:0%
important
 
01:04:59.670 --> 01:04:59.680 align:start position:0%
let me first look at the issue of
 
01:05:01.910 --> 01:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
women's sports and then address the
 
01:05:03.670 --> 01:05:03.680 align:start position:0%
question of having separate physical
 
01:05:06.630 --> 01:05:06.640 align:start position:0%
spaces for women in context where women
 
01:05:09.190 --> 01:05:09.200 align:start position:0%
may be vulnerable
 
01:05:11.109 --> 01:05:11.119 align:start position:0%
when it comes to young women's athletic
 
01:05:13.430 --> 01:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
competitions the state has a very
 
01:05:15.589 --> 01:05:15.599 align:start position:0%
specific interest in differentiating
 
01:05:17.349 --> 01:05:17.359 align:start position:0%
between the two sexes
 
01:05:19.270 --> 01:05:19.280 align:start position:0%
to illustrate this i'd like to give the
 
01:05:22.150 --> 01:05:22.160 align:start position:0%
example of alice and felix
 
01:05:24.309 --> 01:05:24.319 align:start position:0%
the most decorated female olympic runner
 
01:05:25.589 --> 01:05:25.599 align:start position:0%
in history
 
01:05:28.309 --> 01:05:28.319 align:start position:0%
miss felix has had an extraordinary
 
01:05:29.990 --> 01:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
career competing against other
 
01:05:33.190 --> 01:05:33.200 align:start position:0%
biological women from around the world
 
01:05:35.510 --> 01:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
actually miss felix has won more olympic
 
01:05:38.549 --> 01:05:38.559 align:start position:0%
medals than the male athlete usain bolt
 
01:05:40.230 --> 01:05:40.240 align:start position:0%
the single greatest sprinter in the
 
01:05:42.630 --> 01:05:42.640 align:start position:0%
recorded history of the world
 
01:05:45.029 --> 01:05:45.039 align:start position:0%
but how fast is miss felix compared to
 
01:05:45.039 --> 01:05:46.230 align:start position:0%
but how fast is miss felix compared to
males

01:05:46.230 --> 01:05:46.240 align:start position:0%
males
 
01:05:48.549 --> 01:05:48.559 align:start position:0%
felix's lifetime record for the 400
 
01:05:50.190 --> 01:05:50.200 align:start position:0%
meter sprint is
 
01:05:52.309 --> 01:05:52.319 align:start position:0%
49.26 seconds
 
01:05:54.069 --> 01:05:54.079 align:start position:0%
according to public data from high
 
01:05:56.230 --> 01:05:56.240 align:start position:0%
school leagues high school
 
01:05:57.589 --> 01:05:57.599 align:start position:0%
which i have linked in my written
 
01:06:00.069 --> 01:06:00.079 align:start position:0%
testimony hundreds of high school boys
 
01:06:02.950 --> 01:06:02.960 align:start position:0%
in the united states alone can beat that
 
01:06:05.910 --> 01:06:05.920 align:start position:0%
record in fact i happen to know that one
 
01:06:07.589 --> 01:06:07.599 align:start position:0%
of the boys whose names you could see in
 
01:06:09.990 --> 01:06:10.000 align:start position:0%
the records that's in my uh link at the
 
01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:10.870 align:start position:0%
the records that's in my uh link at the
bottom

01:06:10.870 --> 01:06:10.880 align:start position:0%
bottom
 
01:06:12.870 --> 01:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
is a graduate of phillips
 
01:06:16.349 --> 01:06:16.359 align:start position:0%
exeter academy with a 400 meter time of
 
01:06:18.390 --> 01:06:18.400 align:start position:0%
49.09 seconds
 
01:06:20.789 --> 01:06:20.799 align:start position:0%
much faster than miss felix
 
01:06:22.710 --> 01:06:22.720 align:start position:0%
and while i don't want to diminish this
 
01:06:24.950 --> 01:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
young man's accomplishments i can tell
 
01:06:26.710 --> 01:06:26.720 align:start position:0%
you that he has not enjoyed anything
 
01:06:28.470 --> 01:06:28.480 align:start position:0%
approaching world fame
 
01:06:30.390 --> 01:06:30.400 align:start position:0%
nor did he even go on to become a
 
01:06:33.510 --> 01:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
professional athlete after school
 
01:06:35.510 --> 01:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
imagine that the world's next alison
 
01:06:37.750 --> 01:06:37.760 align:start position:0%
felix perhaps a young woman here in new
 
01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:38.710 align:start position:0%
felix perhaps a young woman here in new
hampshire

01:06:38.710 --> 01:06:38.720 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:06:41.589 --> 01:06:41.599 align:start position:0%
has to compete against biological males
 
01:06:43.589 --> 01:06:43.599 align:start position:0%
and as a matter of course
 
01:06:45.430 --> 01:06:45.440 align:start position:0%
these are already the conditions in
 
01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:46.950 align:start position:0%
these are already the conditions in
connecticut

01:06:46.950 --> 01:06:46.960 align:start position:0%
connecticut
 
01:06:49.589 --> 01:06:49.599 align:start position:0%
where biological males have won
 
01:06:52.470 --> 01:06:52.480 align:start position:0%
15 state championship titles
 
01:06:55.430 --> 01:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
in girls high school athletics
 
01:06:57.349 --> 01:06:57.359 align:start position:0%
all with times that would not have
 
01:07:00.230 --> 01:07:00.240 align:start position:0%
qualified them to compete in the boys
 
01:07:02.309 --> 01:07:02.319 align:start position:0%
state championships
 
01:07:04.710 --> 01:07:04.720 align:start position:0%
as more areas adopt policies like
 
01:07:07.670 --> 01:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
manchester's new policy
 
01:07:10.069 --> 01:07:10.079 align:start position:0%
a career like miss felix's will become
 
01:07:13.270 --> 01:07:13.280 align:start position:0%
far more difficult if not impossible
 
01:07:16.470 --> 01:07:16.480 align:start position:0%
i hope this example shows why affording
 
01:07:19.190 --> 01:07:19.200 align:start position:0%
young women an opportunity to compete
 
01:07:21.750 --> 01:07:21.760 align:start position:0%
against members of their own biological
 
01:07:24.390 --> 01:07:24.400 align:start position:0%
sex is important
 
01:07:26.549 --> 01:07:26.559 align:start position:0%
finally i want to return to areas in
 
01:07:28.470 --> 01:07:28.480 align:start position:0%
which we need separate physical spaces
 
01:07:29.910 --> 01:07:29.920 align:start position:0%
for women
 
01:07:32.230 --> 01:07:32.240 align:start position:0%
over a year ago this month california
 
01:07:34.549 --> 01:07:34.559 align:start position:0%
integrated biologically male and female
 
01:07:37.270 --> 01:07:37.280 align:start position:0%
prisoners on the basis of self-declared
 
01:07:38.870 --> 01:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
gender identity
 
01:07:40.710 --> 01:07:40.720 align:start position:0%
and the results have been horrific for
 
01:07:42.549 --> 01:07:42.559 align:start position:0%
women prisoners
 
01:07:44.870 --> 01:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
just months after california's policy
 
01:07:46.230 --> 01:07:46.240 align:start position:0%
was adopted
 
01:07:48.710 --> 01:07:48.720 align:start position:0%
the wall street journal reported that
 
01:07:51.829 --> 01:07:51.839 align:start position:0%
dozens of biological males had already
 
01:07:54.789 --> 01:07:54.799 align:start position:0%
transferred to the central california
 
01:07:56.630 --> 01:07:56.640 align:start position:0%
women's facility
 
01:07:59.029 --> 01:07:59.039 align:start position:0%
many of whom had not had any sex
 
01:08:01.750 --> 01:08:01.760 align:start position:0%
reassignment surgery or even taken
 
01:08:04.630 --> 01:08:04.640 align:start position:0%
hormonal medication
 
01:08:07.029 --> 01:08:07.039 align:start position:0%
i don't wish to be crude about this but
 
01:08:08.950 --> 01:08:08.960 align:start position:0%
i think it's important the committee
 
01:08:10.789 --> 01:08:10.799 align:start position:0%
knows the details of this sensitive
 
01:08:10.799 --> 01:08:12.309 align:start position:0%
knows the details of this sensitive
topic

01:08:12.309 --> 01:08:12.319 align:start position:0%
topic
 
01:08:14.950 --> 01:08:14.960 align:start position:0%
one former inmate of this facility told
 
01:08:17.910 --> 01:08:17.920 align:start position:0%
the wall street journal the following
 
01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:19.430 align:start position:0%
the wall street journal the following

you're locked in this room

24 7
 
01:08:26.950 --> 01:08:26.960 align:start position:0%
with a man and there's nothing you can
 
01:08:29.269 --> 01:08:29.279 align:start position:0%
do about it if you tell the police you
 
01:08:31.430 --> 01:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
don't want to live with a man
 
01:08:34.070 --> 01:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
or you're afraid or whatever you'll get
 
01:08:36.309 --> 01:08:36.319 align:start position:0%
a disciplinary infraction
 
01:08:38.470 --> 01:08:38.480 align:start position:0%
so you're basically punished for being

that is the only

logical outcome if our current laws are
 
01:09:11.669 --> 01:09:11.679 align:start position:0%
stretched to mean that the state can
 
01:09:13.430 --> 01:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
never differentiate between the

biological sexes
 
01:09:18.870 --> 01:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
this committee should act to clarify our
 
01:09:21.669 --> 01:09:21.679 align:start position:0%
state law to preclude
 
01:09:24.390 --> 01:09:24.400 align:start position:0%
absurd and unnecessary interpretations
 
01:09:25.829 --> 01:09:25.839 align:start position:0%
of this kind
 
01:09:27.749 --> 01:09:27.759 align:start position:0%

opportunities for young women
 
01:09:32.789 --> 01:09:32.799 align:start position:0%

oh

01:09:45.910 --> 01:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
oh
 
01:09:49.269 --> 01:09:49.279 align:start position:0%
yes like i could take a few okay
 
01:09:59.990 --> 01:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:01.830 --> 01:10:01.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you
 
01:10:07.910 --> 01:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:12.229 --> 01:10:12.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:15.110 --> 01:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
after your testimony i'm is this bill
 
01:10:20.310 --> 01:10:20.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:21.430 --> 01:10:21.440 align:start position:0%
this has nothing to do with
 
01:10:23.750 --> 01:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
discrimination uh based on their
 
01:10:26.550 --> 01:10:26.560 align:start position:0%
people's gender it's just that the state
 
01:10:29.430 --> 01:10:29.440 align:start position:0%
and public entities can differentiate
 
01:10:31.430 --> 01:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
between the biological male and female
 
01:10:34.630 --> 01:10:34.640 align:start position:0%
sexes in places of uh
 
01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:35.510 align:start position:0%
sexes in places of uh
champ

01:10:35.510 --> 01:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
champ
 
01:10:40.550 --> 01:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:41.910 --> 01:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
and also
 
01:10:44.630 --> 01:10:44.640 align:start position:0%
you know criminal and incarceration and
 
01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:45.430 align:start position:0%
you know criminal and incarceration and
uh

01:10:45.430 --> 01:10:45.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:10:48.149 --> 01:10:48.159 align:start position:0%
private places of like bathrooms
 
01:10:49.510 --> 01:10:49.520 align:start position:0%
has nothing to do with the
 
01:10:55.750 --> 01:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:59.350 --> 01:10:59.360 align:start position:0%
so does this bill apply to all people
 
01:11:00.310 --> 01:11:00.320 align:start position:0%
to what
 
01:11:03.270 --> 01:11:03.280 align:start position:0%
does this bill apply to all people as
 
01:11:05.350 --> 01:11:05.360 align:start position:0%
far as evaluation of their gender and
 
01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:06.229 align:start position:0%
far as evaluation of their gender and
sex

01:11:06.229 --> 01:11:06.239 align:start position:0%
sex
 
01:11:08.630 --> 01:11:08.640 align:start position:0%
in certain places
 
01:11:11.830 --> 01:11:11.840 align:start position:0%
they would have the ability to
 
01:11:13.910 --> 01:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
offer certain
 
01:11:16.310 --> 01:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
accommodations for people based on their
 
01:11:18.550 --> 01:11:18.560 align:start position:0%
biological sex
 
01:11:22.709 --> 01:11:22.719 align:start position:0%
follow-up representative yes thank you
 
01:11:24.950 --> 01:11:24.960 align:start position:0%
so who decides
 
01:11:27.750 --> 01:11:27.760 align:start position:0%
who gets evaluated and how would they be
 
01:11:30.070 --> 01:11:30.080 align:start position:0%
evaluated okay that's an interesting
 
01:11:32.950 --> 01:11:32.960 align:start position:0%
question about how they'd be evaluated
 
01:11:34.470 --> 01:11:34.480 align:start position:0%
is that what you asked
 
01:11:36.790 --> 01:11:36.800 align:start position:0%
i'm asking who would make the decision
 
01:11:39.750 --> 01:11:39.760 align:start position:0%
that someone should be evaluated
 
01:11:43.110 --> 01:11:43.120 align:start position:0%
if they should be evaluated yes
 
01:11:45.510 --> 01:11:45.520 align:start position:0%
okay well so mainly i'm concerned about
 
01:11:48.310 --> 01:11:48.320 align:start position:0%
those three areas the uh sports uh
 
01:11:50.950 --> 01:11:50.960 align:start position:0%
you know competition and criminal
 
01:11:53.510 --> 01:11:53.520 align:start position:0%
incarceration and places of private
 
01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:54.630 align:start position:0%
incarceration and places of private
intimacy

01:11:54.630 --> 01:11:54.640 align:start position:0%
intimacy
 
01:11:57.110 --> 01:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
so um and we
 
01:11:59.189 --> 01:11:59.199 align:start position:0%
for example in uh
 
01:12:01.430 --> 01:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
incarceration we just take it for
 
01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:02.709 align:start position:0%
incarceration we just take it for
granted

01:12:02.709 --> 01:12:02.719 align:start position:0%
granted
 
01:12:05.430 --> 01:12:05.440 align:start position:0%
we don't ask for their chromosomal uh
 
01:12:09.110 --> 01:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
report or their dna
 
01:12:10.870 --> 01:12:10.880 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
01:12:19.110 --> 01:12:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:21.350 --> 01:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
still didn't answer my question about
 
01:12:24.870 --> 01:12:24.880 align:start position:0%
how they would be evaluated okay well so
 
01:12:26.550 --> 01:12:26.560 align:start position:0%
far there has not been an issue about
 
01:12:27.910 --> 01:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
that we haven't asked them for their
 
01:12:36.149 --> 01:12:36.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:47.750 --> 01:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:49.750 --> 01:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
do you realize that
 
01:12:52.149 --> 01:12:52.159 align:start position:0%
that the way that this
 
01:12:54.470 --> 01:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
this bill is written
 
01:12:56.870 --> 01:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
that it would
 
01:12:59.910 --> 01:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:03.110 --> 01:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
it is against our constitution
 
01:13:06.470 --> 01:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
in article 2b
 
01:13:08.229 --> 01:13:08.239 align:start position:0%
the right to privacy
 
01:13:11.030 --> 01:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
an individual's right to live free from
 
01:13:13.750 --> 01:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
governmental intrusion in private or
 
01:13:16.229 --> 01:13:16.239 align:start position:0%
personal information is natural
 
01:13:18.709 --> 01:13:18.719 align:start position:0%
essential and inherent
 
01:13:21.110 --> 01:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
okay well actually what i'm talking
 
01:13:24.310 --> 01:13:24.320 align:start position:0%
about it's implicit now laws because uh
 
01:13:26.790 --> 01:13:26.800 align:start position:0%
for example we do just automatically put
 
01:13:28.950 --> 01:13:28.960 align:start position:0%
men and women's prisons and women
 
01:13:34.070 --> 01:13:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:36.550 --> 01:13:36.560 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much is there any
 
01:13:39.510 --> 01:13:39.520 align:start position:0%
further questions representative gay
 
01:13:41.030 --> 01:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
01:13:43.669 --> 01:13:43.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:46.149 --> 01:13:46.159 align:start position:0%
i don't have covet i'm allergic to foods
 
01:13:46.159 --> 01:13:46.870 align:start position:0%
i don't have covet i'm allergic to foods
and

01:13:46.870 --> 01:13:46.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:13:49.270 --> 01:13:49.280 align:start position:0%
sometimes i eat the wrong ones
 
01:13:51.990 --> 01:13:52.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
01:13:54.870 --> 01:13:54.880 align:start position:0%
i'm going to say how i feel and you can
 
01:13:57.110 --> 01:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
respond because i don't know how to put
 
01:13:58.950 --> 01:13:58.960 align:start position:0%
this in a question
 
01:14:01.669 --> 01:14:01.679 align:start position:0%
there seems to be three three
 
01:14:03.590 --> 01:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
points to this bill
 
01:14:05.510 --> 01:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
i'm comfortable with two of them and not
 
01:14:06.950 --> 01:14:06.960 align:start position:0%
with the third one
 
01:14:10.390 --> 01:14:10.400 align:start position:0%
uh caitlyn jenner has spoken out about
 
01:14:14.630 --> 01:14:14.640 align:start position:0%
sports and uh definitely thinks that a
 
01:14:16.630 --> 01:14:16.640 align:start position:0%
biological voice one moment
 
01:14:21.030 --> 01:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:22.709 --> 01:14:22.719 align:start position:0%
right yes
 
01:14:26.630 --> 01:14:26.640 align:start position:0%
okay uh are you aware are you aware that
 
01:14:30.950 --> 01:14:30.960 align:start position:0%
caitlyn jenner has very much supported
 
01:14:33.750 --> 01:14:33.760 align:start position:0%
not allowing biological boys who are
 
01:14:37.590 --> 01:14:37.600 align:start position:0%
trans to participate in sports because
 
01:14:39.910 --> 01:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
that's just impossible
 
01:14:42.390 --> 01:14:42.400 align:start position:0%
perhaps if children are very very young
 
01:14:45.669 --> 01:14:45.679 align:start position:0%
when their transition may be but
 
01:14:47.350 --> 01:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
from all accounts it
 
01:14:48.870 --> 01:14:48.880 align:start position:0%
it sounds like
 
01:14:50.630 --> 01:14:50.640 align:start position:0%
she's right that
 
01:14:52.950 --> 01:14:52.960 align:start position:0%
they have a physical
 
01:14:52.960 --> 01:14:54.550 align:start position:0%
they have a physical
advantage

01:14:54.550 --> 01:14:54.560 align:start position:0%
advantage
 
01:14:56.470 --> 01:14:56.480 align:start position:0%
so you're aware of that okay thank you
 
01:14:59.110 --> 01:14:59.120 align:start position:0%
for that a question i your
 
01:15:00.790 --> 01:15:00.800 align:start position:0%
question was if i knew about caitlyn
 
01:15:02.790 --> 01:15:02.800 align:start position:0%
jenner and yes i do i just learned about
 
01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:03.590 align:start position:0%
jenner and yes i do i just learned about
that

01:15:03.590 --> 01:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:15:04.870 --> 01:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
instance and that
 
01:15:07.350 --> 01:15:07.360 align:start position:0%
that person is not in favor of having
 
01:15:09.350 --> 01:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
biological males in women's sports
 
01:15:11.750 --> 01:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
biologically women sports
 
01:15:15.510 --> 01:15:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:18.470 --> 01:15:18.480 align:start position:0%
are you aware that
 
01:15:20.709 --> 01:15:20.719 align:start position:0%
there's a difference
 
01:15:23.669 --> 01:15:23.679 align:start position:0%
well do you think there's a difference
 
01:15:26.470 --> 01:15:26.480 align:start position:0%
between teenagers in school
 
01:15:33.189 --> 01:15:33.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:34.790 --> 01:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
01:15:36.870 --> 01:15:36.880 align:start position:0%
are you aware that different schools
 
01:15:38.950 --> 01:15:38.960 align:start position:0%
have different policies but a lot of
 
01:15:41.669 --> 01:15:41.679 align:start position:0%
times they make a separate bathroom they
 
01:15:43.910 --> 01:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
designate a bathroom for the trans kids
 
01:15:46.229 --> 01:15:46.239 align:start position:0%
so they don't have to deal with the
 
01:15:49.030 --> 01:15:49.040 align:start position:0%
pressures from
 
01:15:51.189 --> 01:15:51.199 align:start position:0%
non-trans kids who could be kind of
 
01:15:53.750 --> 01:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
obnoxious i don't quite understand what
 
01:15:55.990 --> 01:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
the question is
 
01:15:58.870 --> 01:15:58.880 align:start position:0%
are you aware of how the high schools
 
01:16:00.470 --> 01:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
are handling it
 
01:16:03.590 --> 01:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
as opposed to a public bathroom
 
01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:04.550 align:start position:0%
as opposed to a public bathroom
where

01:16:04.550 --> 01:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:05.750 align:start position:0%
where
people

01:16:05.750 --> 01:16:05.760 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:16:07.669 --> 01:16:07.679 align:start position:0%
don't have signs on them whereas in high
 
01:16:10.470 --> 01:16:10.480 align:start position:0%
schools everybody knows who's trans
 
01:16:12.550 --> 01:16:12.560 align:start position:0%
okay well i'm not actually don't know
 
01:16:14.630 --> 01:16:14.640 align:start position:0%
specifically what's going on in that
 
01:16:17.030 --> 01:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
respect but
 
01:16:19.510 --> 01:16:19.520 align:start position:0%
with with this bill it clarifies that a
 
01:16:21.669 --> 01:16:21.679 align:start position:0%
school can differentiate between the
 
01:16:25.189 --> 01:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
biological males and females
 
01:16:27.830 --> 01:16:27.840 align:start position:0%
okay well i don't know of any specific
 
01:16:31.350 --> 01:16:31.360 align:start position:0%
instances that you're referring to now
 
01:16:33.510 --> 01:16:33.520 align:start position:0%
one more one one more follow-up thank
 
01:16:33.520 --> 01:16:35.350 align:start position:0%
one more one one more follow-up thank
you

01:16:35.350 --> 01:16:35.360 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:16:39.669 --> 01:16:39.679 align:start position:0%
when it comes to incarceration that also
 
01:16:39.679 --> 01:16:40.790 align:start position:0%
when it comes to incarceration that also
i'm

01:16:40.790 --> 01:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
01:16:45.830 --> 01:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
are you concerned about incarcerating
 
01:16:47.270 --> 01:16:47.280 align:start position:0%
it sounds it sounds like you're
 
01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:48.390 align:start position:0%
it sounds it sounds like you're
concerned

01:16:48.390 --> 01:16:48.400 align:start position:0%
concerned
 
01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:49.189 align:start position:0%
concerned
and

01:16:49.189 --> 01:16:49.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:16:51.189 --> 01:16:51.199 align:start position:0%
but what's the solution
 
01:16:51.199 --> 01:16:52.709 align:start position:0%
but what's the solution
because

01:16:52.709 --> 01:16:52.719 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:16:56.149 --> 01:16:56.159 align:start position:0%
if you just leave it the way it is
 
01:16:58.870 --> 01:16:58.880 align:start position:0%
it's either dangerous for people who are
 
01:17:01.510 --> 01:17:01.520 align:start position:0%
just saying they're trans and aren't
 
01:17:03.350 --> 01:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
and it's dangerous for the people who
 
01:17:04.870 --> 01:17:04.880 align:start position:0%
really are trans
 
01:17:07.669 --> 01:17:07.679 align:start position:0%
to be mixed in with the people who
 
01:17:09.590 --> 01:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
are not so kind
 
01:17:12.149 --> 01:17:12.159 align:start position:0%
yes i understand what you're
 
01:17:14.870 --> 01:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
leading to with that actually uh
 
01:17:17.590 --> 01:17:17.600 align:start position:0%
well this bill will hopefully ward off
 
01:17:20.390 --> 01:17:20.400 align:start position:0%
any laws in the future that might
 
01:17:20.400 --> 01:17:21.189 align:start position:0%
any laws in the future that might
uh

01:17:21.189 --> 01:17:21.199 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:17:23.990 --> 01:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
make those people be to get together a
 
01:17:26.550 --> 01:17:26.560 align:start position:0%
woman you know have to have a
 
01:17:29.590 --> 01:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
biological male in her prison
 
01:17:32.630 --> 01:17:32.640 align:start position:0%
that's the main goal here and as for the
 
01:17:33.830 --> 01:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
other part
 
01:17:35.830 --> 01:17:35.840 align:start position:0%
i guess they'd have to have
 
01:17:38.470 --> 01:17:38.480 align:start position:0%
another space maybe for the people who
 
01:17:40.950 --> 01:17:40.960 align:start position:0%
who would be concerned if they are in
 
01:17:42.790 --> 01:17:42.800 align:start position:0%
the men's prison yeah that's what i
 
01:17:45.510 --> 01:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
would think yes thank you yeah
 
01:17:48.790 --> 01:17:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:49.990 --> 01:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
waves off thank you very much
 
01:17:52.709 --> 01:17:52.719 align:start position:0%
representative representative kirk
 
01:17:55.189 --> 01:17:55.199 align:start position:0%
thank you very much um
 
01:17:58.149 --> 01:17:58.159 align:start position:0%
i mean yeah i'll answer to anything kirk
 
01:17:59.669 --> 01:17:59.679 align:start position:0%
you know i got him
 
01:18:01.510 --> 01:18:01.520 align:start position:0%
so i was concerned going back to the
 
01:18:03.750 --> 01:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
issue of public bathrooms
 
01:18:05.110 --> 01:18:05.120 align:start position:0%
um i do remember actually when he had
 
01:18:06.550 --> 01:18:06.560 align:start position:0%
the transgender rights bill many years
 
01:18:08.390 --> 01:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
ago could you repeat what you're saying
 
01:18:11.110 --> 01:18:11.120 align:start position:0%
yes i i'm going back to the question of
 
01:18:12.390 --> 01:18:12.400 align:start position:0%
public bathrooms and and the
 
01:18:14.149 --> 01:18:14.159 align:start position:0%
implications of that because i was
 
01:18:14.159 --> 01:18:15.189 align:start position:0%
implications of that because i was
curious

01:18:15.189 --> 01:18:15.199 align:start position:0%
curious
 
01:18:18.229 --> 01:18:18.239 align:start position:0%
uh how it works in terms of comfort for
 
01:18:18.239 --> 01:18:19.910 align:start position:0%
uh how it works in terms of comfort for
females

01:18:19.910 --> 01:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
females
 
01:18:23.030 --> 01:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
when a very clearly a male appearing
 
01:18:25.590 --> 01:18:25.600 align:start position:0%
person walks in when we had our
 
01:18:27.110 --> 01:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
hearing here about transgender rights
 
01:18:28.790 --> 01:18:28.800 align:start position:0%
years ago i remember going to the
 
01:18:31.189 --> 01:18:31.199 align:start position:0%
bathroom and a transgender male so
 
01:18:32.870 --> 01:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
biologically female
 
01:18:34.390 --> 01:18:34.400 align:start position:0%
he has a heavier beard than i do though
 
01:18:36.870 --> 01:18:36.880 align:start position:0%
that's a low bar and he walked in he was
 
01:18:38.470 --> 01:18:38.480 align:start position:0%
into the men's bathroom and was very
 
01:18:40.470 --> 01:18:40.480 align:start position:0%
comfortable and a fit how would females
 
01:18:42.390 --> 01:18:42.400 align:start position:0%
feel if he walks into their bathroom
 
01:18:44.709 --> 01:18:44.719 align:start position:0%
when he looks very masculine
 
01:18:45.910 --> 01:18:45.920 align:start position:0%
because that's what would be required
 
01:18:48.229 --> 01:18:48.239 align:start position:0%
under this could you uh ask the question
 
01:18:49.350 --> 01:18:49.360 align:start position:0%
just uh
 
01:18:52.229 --> 01:18:52.239 align:start position:0%
more specifically how would females feel
 
01:18:55.350 --> 01:18:55.360 align:start position:0%
if a very masculine looking transgender
 
01:18:58.390 --> 01:18:58.400 align:start position:0%
male walked into their bathroom
 
01:18:59.830 --> 01:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
and they would have no reason to know
 
01:19:01.669 --> 01:19:01.679 align:start position:0%
that this is a biologic
 
01:19:04.310 --> 01:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
female or born as a female how do you
 
01:19:06.470 --> 01:19:06.480 align:start position:0%
think that would make them feel
 
01:19:07.590 --> 01:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
how the
 
01:19:09.910 --> 01:19:09.920 align:start position:0%
the woman or the girl
 
01:19:13.510 --> 01:19:13.520 align:start position:0%
in the bathroom would feel if a
 
01:19:16.310 --> 01:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
biological male walked in yes a very
 
01:19:18.709 --> 01:19:18.719 align:start position:0%
masculine appearing biological male who
 
01:19:21.110 --> 01:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
is a transgender
 
01:19:23.750 --> 01:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
uh male 1 you mean he says he's a woman
 
01:19:25.110 --> 01:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
in his head
 
01:19:28.709 --> 01:19:28.719 align:start position:0%
no transgender male so therefore he was
 
01:19:31.430 --> 01:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
born biologically a female but
 
01:19:33.350 --> 01:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
identifies as a male but according to
 
01:19:34.870 --> 01:19:34.880 align:start position:0%
this bill he would have to use the
 
01:19:36.630 --> 01:19:36.640 align:start position:0%
women's restroom even though he is a
 
01:19:38.630 --> 01:19:38.640 align:start position:0%
very masculine appearing transgender
 
01:19:41.590 --> 01:19:41.600 align:start position:0%
male well there are tom boys now that
 
01:19:43.430 --> 01:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
are in a woman's bathroom i mean that's
 
01:19:44.870 --> 01:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
been going on
 
01:19:47.030 --> 01:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
for as long as i've been alive and
 
01:19:49.990 --> 01:19:50.000 align:start position:0%
it's the biological female so
 
01:19:51.669 --> 01:19:51.679 align:start position:0%
she's not going to have an erection or
 
01:19:51.679 --> 01:19:53.990 align:start position:0%
she's not going to have an erection or
something

01:19:53.990 --> 01:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:19:55.990 --> 01:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much
 
01:19:58.310 --> 01:19:58.320 align:start position:0%
on that is there any further
 
01:20:00.070 --> 01:20:00.080 align:start position:0%
questions one little one
 
01:20:01.750 --> 01:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
one more follow-up how would you
 
01:20:03.590 --> 01:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
classify and how would you deal with
 
01:20:05.430 --> 01:20:05.440 align:start position:0%
intersex people because that is a real
 
01:20:07.350 --> 01:20:07.360 align:start position:0%
phenomena that does occur where they are
 
01:20:09.990 --> 01:20:10.000 align:start position:0%
not actually clearly male or female
 
01:20:11.590 --> 01:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
repeat the question again a little more
 
01:20:14.229 --> 01:20:14.239 align:start position:0%
clearly how would this if this became
 
01:20:16.629 --> 01:20:16.639 align:start position:0%
law how would it deal with intersex
 
01:20:19.030 --> 01:20:19.040 align:start position:0%
individuals who are not clearly male nor
 
01:20:20.870 --> 01:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
clearly female
 
01:20:22.709 --> 01:20:22.719 align:start position:0%
biologically or biologically
 
01:20:24.629 --> 01:20:24.639 align:start position:0%
biologically would that mean they would
 
01:20:26.950 --> 01:20:26.960 align:start position:0%
have had uh operations
 
01:20:28.870 --> 01:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
not necessarily they don't always have
 
01:20:30.950 --> 01:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
sorry may i respond
 
01:20:32.950 --> 01:20:32.960 align:start position:0%
they don't always have a
 
01:20:35.669 --> 01:20:35.679 align:start position:0%
an operation they may still be intersex
 
01:20:36.950 --> 01:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
would that mean they would have had
 
01:20:39.590 --> 01:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
hormonal medication to change them not
 
01:20:39.600 --> 01:20:40.870 align:start position:0%
hormonal medication to change them not
necessarily

01:20:40.870 --> 01:20:40.880 align:start position:0%
necessarily
 
01:20:42.870 --> 01:20:42.880 align:start position:0%
so biologically they're still a male is
 
01:20:44.070 --> 01:20:44.080 align:start position:0%
that what you're saying
 
01:20:46.149 --> 01:20:46.159 align:start position:0%
intersex has characteristics of both
 
01:20:48.310 --> 01:20:48.320 align:start position:0%
what's that word intersex they have both
 
01:20:50.070 --> 01:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
characteristics of the male and female
 
01:20:52.709 --> 01:20:52.719 align:start position:0%
t-e-r-s-c-x yes it is i've never heard
 
01:20:55.110 --> 01:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
of that phrase actually sexuality is not
 
01:20:56.870 --> 01:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
clear the binary always because there
 
01:20:59.430 --> 01:20:59.440 align:start position:0%
are people are born with with with uh
 
01:21:02.149 --> 01:21:02.159 align:start position:0%
genitalia that are confusing and look
 
01:21:03.990 --> 01:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
maybe female on the inside male on the
 
01:21:05.750 --> 01:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
outside or vice versa or oh you mean
 
01:21:07.990 --> 01:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
they were born that way yes literally
 
01:21:09.510 --> 01:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
yes yeah
 
01:21:09.520 --> 01:21:10.629 align:start position:0%
yes yeah
okay

01:21:10.629 --> 01:21:10.639 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:21:12.149 --> 01:21:12.159 align:start position:0%
that's the biology i'm sorry but that's
 
01:21:12.159 --> 01:21:12.830 align:start position:0%
that's the biology i'm sorry but that's
the

01:21:12.830 --> 01:21:12.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:21:14.229 --> 01:21:14.239 align:start position:0%
biology well they would have they would
 
01:21:16.470 --> 01:21:16.480 align:start position:0%
have had those uh conditions since they
 
01:21:17.830 --> 01:21:17.840 align:start position:0%
were born and
 
01:21:19.510 --> 01:21:19.520 align:start position:0%
i would think that
 
01:21:19.520 --> 01:21:20.709 align:start position:0%
i would think that
those

01:21:20.709 --> 01:21:20.719 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:21:22.310 --> 01:21:22.320 align:start position:0%
issues would have been resolved through
 
01:21:24.709 --> 01:21:24.719 align:start position:0%
all those years
 
01:21:26.950 --> 01:21:26.960 align:start position:0%
about what bathroom they go into i mean
 
01:21:28.550 --> 01:21:28.560 align:start position:0%
when they're five years old they'd have
 
01:21:30.310 --> 01:21:30.320 align:start position:0%
a certain bathroom to go into even
 
01:21:31.750 --> 01:21:31.760 align:start position:0%
before they
 
01:21:34.550 --> 01:21:34.560 align:start position:0%
reach puberty or whatever
 
01:21:35.990 --> 01:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
that's what i would think thank you
 
01:21:38.629 --> 01:21:38.639 align:start position:0%
thank you for that
 
01:21:40.070 --> 01:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
we have
 
01:21:41.350 --> 01:21:41.360 align:start position:0%
another question
 
01:21:43.270 --> 01:21:43.280 align:start position:0%
representative kelsey

representative for letting me ask you a
question

01:21:47.510 --> 01:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:21:49.430 --> 01:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
um i'm gonna shift gears a little bit
 
01:21:52.470 --> 01:21:52.480 align:start position:0%
uh would your bill require any school or
 
01:21:56.229 --> 01:21:56.239 align:start position:0%
agency to adopt any specific policy
 
01:21:58.070 --> 01:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
no the uh
 
01:22:00.790 --> 01:22:00.800 align:start position:0%
the town or the school could adopt
 
01:22:03.030 --> 01:22:03.040 align:start position:0%
whatever policies they want
 
01:22:05.030 --> 01:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
okay thank you so much yeah
 
01:22:05.910 --> 01:22:05.920 align:start position:0%

01:22:22.870 --> 01:22:22.880 align:start position:0%
and uh before we
 
01:22:25.990 --> 01:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
hear madame o'brien food home o'brien uh

testimony so we'll be doing a
 
01:22:32.870 --> 01:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
approximate three minutes for each
 
01:22:34.470 --> 01:22:34.480 align:start position:0%
individual to make sure everyone is
 
01:22:37.030 --> 01:22:37.040 align:start position:0%
heard during the time that we have so
 
01:22:38.390 --> 01:22:38.400 align:start position:0%
make sure you're succinct until the
 
01:22:38.400 --> 01:22:39.350 align:start position:0%
make sure you're succinct until the
point

01:22:39.350 --> 01:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
point
 
01:22:40.950 --> 01:22:40.960 align:start position:0%
uh in your testimony for us to get
 
01:22:44.709 --> 01:22:44.719 align:start position:0%
educated together very quickly
 
01:22:44.719 --> 01:22:47.350 align:start position:0%

01:22:47.350 --> 01:22:47.360 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:22:49.590 --> 01:22:49.600 align:start position:0%
thank you i'm catherine prudom o'brien i
 
01:22:52.870 --> 01:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
represent the town of derry
 
01:22:56.229 --> 01:22:56.239 align:start position:0%
i know this is a very sensitive issue
 
01:22:58.310 --> 01:22:58.320 align:start position:0%
and it's a sensitive issue for a lot of
 
01:23:00.310 --> 01:23:00.320 align:start position:0%
people in our communities
 
01:23:03.189 --> 01:23:03.199 align:start position:0%
and i want to just start out with the
 
01:23:06.390 --> 01:23:06.400 align:start position:0%
premise that i am trying to be kind and
 
01:23:09.270 --> 01:23:09.280 align:start position:0%
thoughtful and understanding
 
01:23:11.990 --> 01:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
of the pressures that we all are going
 
01:23:14.229 --> 01:23:14.239 align:start position:0%
through and the special circumstances
 
01:23:17.750 --> 01:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
that individuals have
 
01:23:20.390 --> 01:23:20.400 align:start position:0%
this bill may not be absolutely 100
 
01:23:22.310 --> 01:23:22.320 align:start position:0%
perfect to everyone and there may be
 
01:23:25.189 --> 01:23:25.199 align:start position:0%
some changes that that are
 
01:23:27.669 --> 01:23:27.679 align:start position:0%
anticipated or
 
01:23:27.679 --> 01:23:28.950 align:start position:0%
anticipated or
proposed

01:23:28.950 --> 01:23:28.960 align:start position:0%
proposed
 
01:23:30.629 --> 01:23:30.639 align:start position:0%
and i'm not
 
01:23:33.590 --> 01:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
opposed to that necessarily
 
01:23:33.600 --> 01:23:37.030 align:start position:0%
opposed to that necessarily
uh

01:23:37.030 --> 01:23:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:39.030 --> 01:23:39.040 align:start position:0%
but i want to talk about the
 
01:23:43.590 --> 01:23:43.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:46.310 --> 01:23:46.320 align:start position:0%
some of my own experiences when
 
01:23:47.990 --> 01:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
when representative gould was talking
 
01:23:50.470 --> 01:23:50.480 align:start position:0%
about the woman the women at a women's
 
01:23:51.830 --> 01:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
prison who
 
01:23:54.149 --> 01:23:54.159 align:start position:0%
had to be housed with people who were
 
01:23:55.510 --> 01:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
born male
 
01:23:58.310 --> 01:23:58.320 align:start position:0%
i recall this a personal situation that
 
01:24:00.229 --> 01:24:00.239 align:start position:0%
i had that i will explain in a little
 
01:24:02.149 --> 01:24:02.159 align:start position:0%
while but it's really difficult to talk
 
01:24:04.629 --> 01:24:04.639 align:start position:0%
about but i'm going to get there
 
01:24:08.390 --> 01:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
uh i know three minutes uh first of all
 
01:24:09.830 --> 01:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
speaking about the corrections
 
01:24:12.229 --> 01:24:12.239 align:start position:0%
institutions the uni the united kingdom
 
01:24:15.110 --> 01:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
ministry of justice
 
01:24:16.390 --> 01:24:16.400 align:start position:0%
reported that
 
01:24:19.910 --> 01:24:19.920 align:start position:0%
uh trans inmates who i identify as women
 
01:24:22.310 --> 01:24:22.320 align:start position:0%
but are housed with
 
01:24:26.229 --> 01:24:26.239 align:start position:0%
natural of women born female
 
01:24:28.470 --> 01:24:28.480 align:start position:0%
had an exponentially higher rate of
 
01:24:31.750 --> 01:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
sexual assault of sexually assaulting
 
01:24:34.390 --> 01:24:34.400 align:start position:0%
the the natal females
 
01:24:35.350 --> 01:24:35.360 align:start position:0%
and that
 
01:24:37.030 --> 01:24:37.040 align:start position:0%
comes from an article that i just read
 
01:24:39.750 --> 01:24:39.760 align:start position:0%
in the daily mail from may 18 2020
 
01:24:41.669 --> 01:24:41.679 align:start position:0%
written by don shaw so you can look that
 
01:24:43.750 --> 01:24:43.760 align:start position:0%
up i'm trying to be very factual about
 
01:24:46.870 --> 01:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:48.470 --> 01:24:48.480 align:start position:0%
i'm concerned about
 
01:24:51.990 --> 01:24:52.000 align:start position:0%
women that are competing in sports
 
01:24:53.830 --> 01:24:53.840 align:start position:0%
that it won't be fair to them to be
 
01:24:56.550 --> 01:24:56.560 align:start position:0%
competing with people born male
 
01:24:58.709 --> 01:24:58.719 align:start position:0%
that's that's unfair
 
01:25:00.790 --> 01:25:00.800 align:start position:0%
um there was a privacy concern brought
 
01:25:03.189 --> 01:25:03.199 align:start position:0%
up by one of the representatives
 
01:25:05.669 --> 01:25:05.679 align:start position:0%
regarding our constitution
 
01:25:07.590 --> 01:25:07.600 align:start position:0%
well when you are in the prison system
 
01:25:08.950 --> 01:25:08.960 align:start position:0%
you do have to go through some
 
01:25:10.790 --> 01:25:10.800 align:start position:0%
examinations to find out what your
 
01:25:13.189 --> 01:25:13.199 align:start position:0%
gender is that you know we're not
 
01:25:14.310 --> 01:25:14.320 align:start position:0%
all of us right here would be
 
01:25:16.470 --> 01:25:16.480 align:start position:0%
comfortable doing on the daily on a
 
01:25:18.229 --> 01:25:18.239 align:start position:0%
daily basis but that's that is what
 
01:25:20.310 --> 01:25:20.320 align:start position:0%
happens there
 
01:25:20.320 --> 01:25:21.990 align:start position:0%
happens there
um

01:25:21.990 --> 01:25:22.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:24.550 --> 01:25:24.560 align:start position:0%
okay so my own my own situation is when
 
01:25:27.669 --> 01:25:27.679 align:start position:0%
i was a teenager i was in a living
 
01:25:29.669 --> 01:25:29.679 align:start position:0%
situation that was
 
01:25:32.790 --> 01:25:32.800 align:start position:0%
not good and i was um
 
01:25:34.870 --> 01:25:34.880 align:start position:0%
there's sexual abuse and i was placed
 
01:25:36.070 --> 01:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
into a
 
01:25:38.310 --> 01:25:38.320 align:start position:0%
group home in the foster care system
 
01:25:41.030 --> 01:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
when i got there it was an all-female
 
01:25:43.350 --> 01:25:43.360 align:start position:0%
group home
 
01:25:44.629 --> 01:25:44.639 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
01:25:46.790 --> 01:25:46.800 align:start position:0%
and when i found out that it was
 
01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:47.910 align:start position:0%
and when i found out that it was
becoming

01:25:47.910 --> 01:25:47.920 align:start position:0%
becoming
 
01:25:51.750 --> 01:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
uh co-ed um i became very alarmed
 
01:25:54.870 --> 01:25:54.880 align:start position:0%
because this was my i was a teenager and
 
01:25:56.070 --> 01:25:56.080 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of foster homes for
 
01:25:57.990 --> 01:25:58.000 align:start position:0%
teenagers so this was the only option i
 
01:25:58.000 --> 01:25:58.870 align:start position:0%
teenagers so this was the only option i
had

01:25:58.870 --> 01:25:58.880 align:start position:0%
had
 
01:26:00.550 --> 01:26:00.560 align:start position:0%
my social worker was looking for a very
 
01:26:03.750 --> 01:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
long time for a place for me to live
 
01:26:06.229 --> 01:26:06.239 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:26:08.229 --> 01:26:08.239 align:start position:0%
i didn't have i didn't have a lock on my
 
01:26:11.189 --> 01:26:11.199 align:start position:0%
door didn't have my own bedroom and the
 
01:26:14.229 --> 01:26:14.239 align:start position:0%
woman that ran the home said that
 
01:26:16.149 --> 01:26:16.159 align:start position:0%
she had a lot of problems with boys
 
01:26:17.590 --> 01:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
coming in in the middle of the night
 
01:26:19.590 --> 01:26:19.600 align:start position:0%
hitting on girls when they didn't want
 
01:26:19.600 --> 01:26:20.390 align:start position:0%
hitting on girls when they didn't want
it

01:26:20.390 --> 01:26:20.400 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:26:22.149 --> 01:26:22.159 align:start position:0%
which you know you can figure out what
 
01:26:24.070 --> 01:26:24.080 align:start position:0%
that really means i was
 
01:26:26.229 --> 01:26:26.239 align:start position:0%
looking at bridges to live under and
 
01:26:28.870 --> 01:26:28.880 align:start position:0%
places i knew in the woods to go live in
 
01:26:28.880 --> 01:26:29.830 align:start position:0%
places i knew in the woods to go live in
because

01:26:29.830 --> 01:26:29.840 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:26:30.950 --> 01:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
i couldn't figure out where i was going
 
01:26:33.030 --> 01:26:33.040 align:start position:0%
to find a safe place otherwise
 
01:26:33.040 --> 01:26:33.910 align:start position:0%
to find a safe place otherwise
and

01:26:33.910 --> 01:26:33.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:26:35.990 --> 01:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
i ended up going back to the place where
 
01:26:37.910 --> 01:26:37.920 align:start position:0%
i originally lived
 
01:26:39.510 --> 01:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
um and barricading my door with
 
01:26:42.070 --> 01:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
furniture so i could be safe
 
01:26:43.990 --> 01:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
and that is not something that would be
 
01:26:46.629 --> 01:26:46.639 align:start position:0%
afforded to the woman that was described
 
01:26:46.639 --> 01:26:47.430 align:start position:0%
afforded to the woman that was described
by

01:26:47.430 --> 01:26:47.440 align:start position:0%
by
 
01:26:49.990 --> 01:26:50.000 align:start position:0%
by representative gould in the in the
 
01:26:52.229 --> 01:26:52.239 align:start position:0%
prison system
 
01:26:54.390 --> 01:26:54.400 align:start position:0%
it's hellacious and you need when you're
 
01:26:56.229 --> 01:26:56.239 align:start position:0%
in the when you're in the correctional
 
01:26:57.830 --> 01:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
institution you want to be focusing on
 
01:26:59.189 --> 01:26:59.199 align:start position:0%
the next steps that you have to take to
 
01:27:00.870 --> 01:27:00.880 align:start position:0%
be healthy and
 
01:27:02.310 --> 01:27:02.320 align:start position:0%
get better
 
01:27:04.149 --> 01:27:04.159 align:start position:0%
and that's what i'd like for the women
 
01:27:05.750 --> 01:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
in the prison system in our state as
 
01:27:07.750 --> 01:27:07.760 align:start position:0%
well we just want to protect those women
 
01:27:07.760 --> 01:27:09.990 align:start position:0%
well we just want to protect those women
and

01:27:09.990 --> 01:27:10.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:27:11.350 --> 01:27:11.360 align:start position:0%

01:27:14.790 --> 01:27:14.800 align:start position:0%
be perfect with that but i will do my
 
01:27:16.629 --> 01:27:16.639 align:start position:0%

01:27:18.629 --> 01:27:18.639 align:start position:0%

questions for representative putin

o'brien
 
01:27:22.629 --> 01:27:22.639 align:start position:0%
representative gay
 
01:27:24.550 --> 01:27:24.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
01:27:27.270 --> 01:27:27.280 align:start position:0%
are you equivilating
 
01:27:29.189 --> 01:27:29.199 align:start position:0%
god it's not a good word
 
01:27:31.590 --> 01:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
are you making it equivalent are you
 
01:27:31.600 --> 01:27:32.790 align:start position:0%
are you making it equivalent are you
assuming

01:27:32.790 --> 01:27:32.800 align:start position:0%
assuming
 
01:27:32.800 --> 01:27:36.070 align:start position:0%
assuming
that

01:27:36.070 --> 01:27:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:38.470 --> 01:27:38.480 align:start position:0%
putting trans people
 
01:27:41.030 --> 01:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
in their uh
 
01:27:41.040 --> 01:27:42.629 align:start position:0%
in their uh
sexual

01:27:42.629 --> 01:27:42.639 align:start position:0%
sexual
 
01:27:44.390 --> 01:27:44.400 align:start position:0%
where they feel they are
 
01:27:47.030 --> 01:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
in prison are you assuming that that's
 
01:27:49.110 --> 01:27:49.120 align:start position:0%
the only option
 
01:27:51.750 --> 01:27:51.760 align:start position:0%
that and that all trans women are
 
01:27:54.310 --> 01:27:54.320 align:start position:0%
dangerous no absolutely not absolutely
 
01:27:56.390 --> 01:27:56.400 align:start position:0%
not thank you for that question i really
 
01:27:59.590 --> 01:27:59.600 align:start position:0%
appreciate being able to to say that no
 
01:28:01.270 --> 01:28:01.280 align:start position:0%
i don't think that trans people are
 
01:28:03.350 --> 01:28:03.360 align:start position:0%
dangerous i think that
 
01:28:05.350 --> 01:28:05.360 align:start position:0%
there are vulnerabilities that will be
 
01:28:08.390 --> 01:28:08.400 align:start position:0%
exploited though and i
 
01:28:11.030 --> 01:28:11.040 align:start position:0%
i've also spent time talking with i was
 
01:28:12.470 --> 01:28:12.480 align:start position:0%
in a rape survivor support group and
 
01:28:13.750 --> 01:28:13.760 align:start position:0%
i've spent a lot of time talking to
 
01:28:16.070 --> 01:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
convicted sex offenders and i just
 
01:28:17.510 --> 01:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
i can just tell you they'll exploit
 
01:28:19.270 --> 01:28:19.280 align:start position:0%
anything that they can
 
01:28:21.350 --> 01:28:21.360 align:start position:0%
they could even pretend to be trans just
 
01:28:23.669 --> 01:28:23.679 align:start position:0%
to make an exploitation of of a
 
01:28:23.679 --> 01:28:25.110 align:start position:0%
to make an exploitation of of a
vulnerability

01:28:25.110 --> 01:28:25.120 align:start position:0%
vulnerability
 
01:28:26.950 --> 01:28:26.960 align:start position:0%
so i i'm glad you asked that question
 
01:28:28.709 --> 01:28:28.719 align:start position:0%
because i would really like to say that
 
01:28:30.390 --> 01:28:30.400 align:start position:0%
no i don't think that all trans people
 
01:28:33.350 --> 01:28:33.360 align:start position:0%
are dangerous absolutely not
 
01:28:33.360 --> 01:28:34.149 align:start position:0%
are dangerous absolutely not
and

01:28:34.149 --> 01:28:34.159 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:28:36.070 --> 01:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
is that the only the options that we
 
01:28:37.830 --> 01:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
have right now a male prison or female
 
01:28:39.750 --> 01:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
prison are those the only ones we have i
 
01:28:41.669 --> 01:28:41.679 align:start position:0%
think that it might be good to explore
 
01:28:43.590 --> 01:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
other another option which would be
 
01:28:45.910 --> 01:28:45.920 align:start position:0%
placement appropriate placement for
 
01:28:48.310 --> 01:28:48.320 align:start position:0%
trans inmates as well that they could be
 
01:28:50.149 --> 01:28:50.159 align:start position:0%
treated well but
 
01:28:52.709 --> 01:28:52.719 align:start position:0%
perhaps separated
 
01:28:54.709 --> 01:28:54.719 align:start position:0%
for for the safety of of all people
 
01:29:00.709 --> 01:29:00.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:02.149 --> 01:29:02.159 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:29:03.590 --> 01:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
01:29:05.830 --> 01:29:05.840 align:start position:0%
um thank you for taking my question do
 
01:29:07.430 --> 01:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
you realize
 
01:29:09.350 --> 01:29:09.360 align:start position:0%
that transgender women
 
01:29:10.709 --> 01:29:10.719 align:start position:0%
with breasts
 
01:29:12.629 --> 01:29:12.639 align:start position:0%
and a vagina
 
01:29:16.229 --> 01:29:16.239 align:start position:0%
based on this legislation could be
 
01:29:16.239 --> 01:29:17.350 align:start position:0%
based on this legislation could be
housed

01:29:17.350 --> 01:29:17.360 align:start position:0%
housed
 
01:29:20.390 --> 01:29:20.400 align:start position:0%
in a male institution
 
01:29:21.990 --> 01:29:22.000 align:start position:0%
i think that it would be good to explore
 
01:29:23.990 --> 01:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
some other options for very specific
 
01:29:26.229 --> 01:29:26.239 align:start position:0%
individual concerns that you're talking
 
01:29:26.239 --> 01:29:27.910 align:start position:0%
individual concerns that you're talking
about

01:29:27.910 --> 01:29:27.920 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:29:27.920 --> 01:29:30.229 align:start position:0%
about
follow-up

01:29:30.229 --> 01:29:30.239 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:29:32.629 --> 01:29:32.639 align:start position:0%
you have mentioned that maybe there need
 
01:29:35.189 --> 01:29:35.199 align:start position:0%
to be separate institutions to house
 
01:29:38.310 --> 01:29:38.320 align:start position:0%
these people what would the cost to the
 
01:29:39.830 --> 01:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
state be
 
01:29:41.590 --> 01:29:41.600 align:start position:0%
well they don't necessarily have to be
 
01:29:43.189 --> 01:29:43.199 align:start position:0%
separate institutions but they could be
 
01:29:43.199 --> 01:29:44.390 align:start position:0%
separate institutions but they could be
separate

01:29:44.390 --> 01:29:44.400 align:start position:0%
separate
 
01:29:47.830 --> 01:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
housing uh options such as a different
 
01:29:47.840 --> 01:29:49.350 align:start position:0%
housing uh options such as a different
area

01:29:49.350 --> 01:29:49.360 align:start position:0%
area
 
01:29:51.669 --> 01:29:51.679 align:start position:0%
okay i would i would i would like to say
 
01:29:53.350 --> 01:29:53.360 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your question
 
01:29:55.590 --> 01:29:55.600 align:start position:0%
and i want people treated fairly and
 
01:29:58.390 --> 01:29:58.400 align:start position:0%
equally people of all kinds
 
01:29:59.750 --> 01:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
and that's
 
01:30:02.070 --> 01:30:02.080 align:start position:0%
that's what i hope will happen
 
01:30:04.149 --> 01:30:04.159 align:start position:0%
that is my aim
 
01:30:07.510 --> 01:30:07.520 align:start position:0%
and that includes the trans community
 
01:30:09.030 --> 01:30:09.040 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
01:30:11.750 --> 01:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
one more follow-up yes one more
 
01:30:13.910 --> 01:30:13.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you
 
01:30:17.910 --> 01:30:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:19.669 --> 01:30:19.679 align:start position:0%
i'm going to go back to a question i had
 
01:30:19.679 --> 01:30:21.750 align:start position:0%
i'm going to go back to a question i had
before

01:30:21.750 --> 01:30:21.760 align:start position:0%
before
 
01:30:25.430 --> 01:30:25.440 align:start position:0%
who decides who should be evaluated and
 
01:30:28.149 --> 01:30:28.159 align:start position:0%
how will that decision be made
 
01:30:30.310 --> 01:30:30.320 align:start position:0%
thank you i think that's a good question
 
01:30:32.870 --> 01:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
when you go into the into the
 
01:30:35.590 --> 01:30:35.600 align:start position:0%
penal system
 
01:30:37.510 --> 01:30:37.520 align:start position:0%
that that's already a decision that's
 
01:30:39.189 --> 01:30:39.199 align:start position:0%
made and that's already an assessment
 
01:30:41.110 --> 01:30:41.120 align:start position:0%
that's made
 
01:30:44.149 --> 01:30:44.159 align:start position:0%
i think that you you pro i'm gonna move
 
01:30:45.910 --> 01:30:45.920 align:start position:0%
quickly and to say that i think you are
 
01:30:48.229 --> 01:30:48.239 align:start position:0%
talking about maybe some concerns about
 
01:30:50.070 --> 01:30:50.080 align:start position:0%
on the street when people are coming
 
01:30:53.189 --> 01:30:53.199 align:start position:0%
into a bathroom or something and people
 
01:30:54.550 --> 01:30:54.560 align:start position:0%
may fight amongst themselves in the
 
01:30:54.560 --> 01:30:55.990 align:start position:0%
may fight amongst themselves in the
public

01:30:55.990 --> 01:30:56.000 align:start position:0%
public
 
01:30:58.310 --> 01:30:58.320 align:start position:0%
about someone looking
 
01:31:00.070 --> 01:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
in a way that they are concerned about
 
01:31:03.270 --> 01:31:03.280 align:start position:0%
and is would be scary to them
 
01:31:05.510 --> 01:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
i think that is a that is a concern
 
01:31:07.430 --> 01:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
and i don't want that that to happen i
 
01:31:09.110 --> 01:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
don't want any i don't want people to
 
01:31:11.350 --> 01:31:11.360 align:start position:0%
fight with each other and and have a
 
01:31:14.070 --> 01:31:14.080 align:start position:0%
potential for possible violence in those
 
01:31:16.950 --> 01:31:16.960 align:start position:0%
cases but what i am seeing in many
 
01:31:19.350 --> 01:31:19.360 align:start position:0%
businesses more and more now are
 
01:31:22.470 --> 01:31:22.480 align:start position:0%
individual bathrooms where that is that
 
01:31:24.950 --> 01:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
concern is automatically
 
01:31:27.990 --> 01:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
off the table when i go to the grocery
 
01:31:30.629 --> 01:31:30.639 align:start position:0%
stores and other places that's happening
 
01:31:32.310 --> 01:31:32.320 align:start position:0%
more and more and that's a that would be
 
01:31:32.320 --> 01:31:33.030 align:start position:0%
more and more and that's a that would be
a

01:31:33.030 --> 01:31:33.040 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:31:34.550 --> 01:31:34.560 align:start position:0%
sensitive and appropriate way to address
 
01:31:36.470 --> 01:31:36.480 align:start position:0%
the issue i hope you would agree with
 
01:31:36.480 --> 01:31:37.910 align:start position:0%
the issue i hope you would agree with
that

01:31:37.910 --> 01:31:37.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:31:40.550 --> 01:31:40.560 align:start position:0%
i i i am concerned about the same things
 
01:31:41.990 --> 01:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
leave it at that answer right there
 
01:31:45.910 --> 01:31:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:47.590 --> 01:31:47.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:31:54.470 --> 01:31:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:56.229 --> 01:31:56.239 align:start position:0%
i am
 
01:31:59.510 --> 01:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
wondering if the approach that we are
 
01:31:59.520 --> 01:32:00.870 align:start position:0%
wondering if the approach that we are
taking

01:32:00.870 --> 01:32:00.880 align:start position:0%
taking
 
01:32:04.149 --> 01:32:04.159 align:start position:0%
to deal with aggressors and aggression
 
01:32:07.350 --> 01:32:07.360 align:start position:0%
which is the problem
 
01:32:09.669 --> 01:32:09.679 align:start position:0%
is the wrong approach
 
01:32:12.550 --> 01:32:12.560 align:start position:0%
somebody who commits an assault somebody
 
01:32:15.430 --> 01:32:15.440 align:start position:0%
who is gaming the system
 
01:32:18.550 --> 01:32:18.560 align:start position:0%
somebody who is putting other people in
 
01:32:20.790 --> 01:32:20.800 align:start position:0%
genuine fear
 
01:32:22.550 --> 01:32:22.560 align:start position:0%
is the problem
 
01:32:25.669 --> 01:32:25.679 align:start position:0%
and what we would you agree that what we
 
01:32:27.510 --> 01:32:27.520 align:start position:0%
need to do
 
01:32:30.229 --> 01:32:30.239 align:start position:0%
is address the people who are the
 
01:32:33.990 --> 01:32:34.000 align:start position:0%
aggressors and the problem
 
01:32:36.390 --> 01:32:36.400 align:start position:0%
and the people who are the aggressors
 
01:32:38.070 --> 01:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
and the problem
 
01:32:42.470 --> 01:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
are not the transgender people
 
01:32:42.480 --> 01:32:43.910 align:start position:0%
are not the transgender people
so

01:32:43.910 --> 01:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:32:46.790 --> 01:32:46.800 align:start position:0%
why would we be
 
01:32:51.350 --> 01:32:51.360 align:start position:0%
burdening the transgender people
 
01:32:54.070 --> 01:32:54.080 align:start position:0%
for the acts of people who are
 
01:32:57.270 --> 01:32:57.280 align:start position:0%
aggressors and ought to be
 
01:33:00.390 --> 01:33:00.400 align:start position:0%
stopped from their aggression and if we
 
01:33:02.390 --> 01:33:02.400 align:start position:0%
have a problem with the prison
 
01:33:02.400 --> 01:33:04.070 align:start position:0%
have a problem with the prison
population

01:33:04.070 --> 01:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
population
 
01:33:06.149 --> 01:33:06.159 align:start position:0%
should we not be addressing the
 
01:33:10.070 --> 01:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
aggressors in the prison population
 
01:33:12.709 --> 01:33:12.719 align:start position:0%
rather than burdening a community that's
 
01:33:12.719 --> 01:33:13.750 align:start position:0%
rather than burdening a community that's
already

01:33:13.750 --> 01:33:13.760 align:start position:0%
already
 
01:33:15.910 --> 01:33:15.920 align:start position:0%
burdened enough
 
01:33:18.149 --> 01:33:18.159 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question
 
01:33:19.830 --> 01:33:19.840 align:start position:0%
i think
 
01:33:22.390 --> 01:33:22.400 align:start position:0%
that's true yes we should
 
01:33:24.149 --> 01:33:24.159 align:start position:0%
attack the people
 
01:33:25.990 --> 01:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
that problem not the people but we
 
01:33:28.070 --> 01:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
should attract attack the problem of
 
01:33:29.990 --> 01:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
people that are being aggressive and i
 
01:33:31.510 --> 01:33:31.520 align:start position:0%
think this is a tool that will help to
 
01:33:34.950 --> 01:33:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:36.870 --> 01:33:36.880 align:start position:0%
what about the women that would have to
 
01:33:39.590 --> 01:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
be in a in a prison system
 
01:33:39.600 --> 01:33:41.270 align:start position:0%
be in a in a prison system
with

01:33:41.270 --> 01:33:41.280 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:33:42.790 --> 01:33:42.800 align:start position:0%
men men
 
01:33:44.310 --> 01:33:44.320 align:start position:0%
who were born male
 
01:33:46.470 --> 01:33:46.480 align:start position:0%
and now identifying as female that may
 
01:33:48.709 --> 01:33:48.719 align:start position:0%
be more of a risk to them
 
01:33:50.870 --> 01:33:50.880 align:start position:0%
i think this gives a tool to to our
 
01:33:53.590 --> 01:33:53.600 align:start position:0%
community to address this issue in the
 
01:33:56.550 --> 01:33:56.560 align:start position:0%
same way that if i were on the uh
 
01:33:58.310 --> 01:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
if i were in the united kingdom ministry
 
01:33:59.990 --> 01:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
of justice and i was reading this study
 
01:34:02.390 --> 01:34:02.400 align:start position:0%
from 2018 that i first talked about that
 
01:34:04.390 --> 01:34:04.400 align:start position:0%
i would i would be wanting
 
01:34:06.390 --> 01:34:06.400 align:start position:0%
i would want a way to address this issue
 
01:34:08.149 --> 01:34:08.159 align:start position:0%
because when it hadn't been addressed
 
01:34:09.830 --> 01:34:09.840 align:start position:0%
they're dealing with a different problem
 
01:34:09.840 --> 01:34:11.590 align:start position:0%
they're dealing with a different problem
now

01:34:11.590 --> 01:34:11.600 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:34:15.270 --> 01:34:15.280 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative folsom
 
01:34:16.790 --> 01:34:16.800 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman thank you for taking
 
01:34:19.270 --> 01:34:19.280 align:start position:0%
my question i was
 
01:34:21.990 --> 01:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
very intrigued by the report from
 
01:34:24.310 --> 01:34:24.320 align:start position:0%
england that you were talking about
 
01:34:24.320 --> 01:34:26.229 align:start position:0%
england that you were talking about
and

01:34:26.229 --> 01:34:26.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:34:28.550 --> 01:34:28.560 align:start position:0%
to be honest i didn't even know that
 
01:34:29.990 --> 01:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
they were doing
 
01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:31.270 align:start position:0%
they were doing
transgender

01:34:31.270 --> 01:34:31.280 align:start position:0%
transgender
 
01:34:33.750 --> 01:34:33.760 align:start position:0%
uh populations in different prisons
 
01:34:34.709 --> 01:34:34.719 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:34:36.390 --> 01:34:36.400 align:start position:0%
you know i'm like looking it up really
 
01:34:37.669 --> 01:34:37.679 align:start position:0%
quick um
 
01:34:40.390 --> 01:34:40.400 align:start position:0%
and i've i've found something and i'd
 
01:34:41.430 --> 01:34:41.440 align:start position:0%
like to
 
01:34:43.109 --> 01:34:43.119 align:start position:0%
get your opinion as to whether or not
 
01:34:45.590 --> 01:34:45.600 align:start position:0%
you think this is kind of where a
 
01:34:49.430 --> 01:34:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:52.149 --> 01:34:52.159 align:start position:0%
basically within the
 
01:34:52.159 --> 01:34:53.350 align:start position:0%
basically within the
prisons

01:34:53.350 --> 01:34:53.360 align:start position:0%
prisons
 
01:34:55.750 --> 01:34:55.760 align:start position:0%
a transgender accommodation unit would
 
01:34:58.070 --> 01:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
be established
 
01:34:58.080 --> 01:34:59.030 align:start position:0%
be established
and

01:34:59.030 --> 01:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:35:02.310 --> 01:35:02.320 align:start position:0%
then for the sleeping arrangements but
 
01:35:05.590 --> 01:35:05.600 align:start position:0%
then during the day the the population
 
01:35:07.189 --> 01:35:07.199 align:start position:0%
would be together
 
01:35:08.950 --> 01:35:08.960 align:start position:0%
um but the thing that was very
 
01:35:11.270 --> 01:35:11.280 align:start position:0%
interesting to me and this is my big
 
01:35:13.590 --> 01:35:13.600 align:start position:0%
question because it addresses
 
01:35:16.310 --> 01:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
a couple other representatives questions
 
01:35:17.590 --> 01:35:17.600 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:35:21.350 --> 01:35:21.360 align:start position:0%
they had to obtain a gender recognition
 
01:35:24.149 --> 01:35:24.159 align:start position:0%
certificate i'm assuming that means
 
01:35:26.870 --> 01:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
there was a prison psychiatrist that
 
01:35:29.830 --> 01:35:29.840 align:start position:0%
they had to go to and state yes this is
 
01:35:29.840 --> 01:35:31.990 align:start position:0%
they had to go to and state yes this is
really

01:35:31.990 --> 01:35:32.000 align:start position:0%
really
 
01:35:33.910 --> 01:35:33.920 align:start position:0%
who i am
 
01:35:36.709 --> 01:35:36.719 align:start position:0%
this is how
 
01:35:39.510 --> 01:35:39.520 align:start position:0%
i want to associate
 
01:35:43.270 --> 01:35:43.280 align:start position:0%
would it be appropriate for
 
01:35:46.310 --> 01:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
someone who wants to declare themselves
 
01:35:48.070 --> 01:35:48.080 align:start position:0%
transgender after they've gotten to
 
01:35:48.080 --> 01:35:48.950 align:start position:0%
transgender after they've gotten to
prison

01:35:48.950 --> 01:35:48.960 align:start position:0%
prison
 
01:35:51.510 --> 01:35:51.520 align:start position:0%
you know so there's no history yet of
 
01:35:51.520 --> 01:35:52.470 align:start position:0%
you know so there's no history yet of
them

01:35:52.470 --> 01:35:52.480 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:35:55.109 --> 01:35:55.119 align:start position:0%
would it be appropriate for them to have
 
01:35:56.629 --> 01:35:56.639 align:start position:0%
to see
 
01:35:59.750 --> 01:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
the prison psychologist for a while to
 
01:36:02.070 --> 01:36:02.080 align:start position:0%
weed out the people
 
01:36:04.709 --> 01:36:04.719 align:start position:0%
that are the aggressors
 
01:36:07.030 --> 01:36:07.040 align:start position:0%
and let allow
 
01:36:10.149 --> 01:36:10.159 align:start position:0%
the ones that are not the aggressors
 
01:36:12.870 --> 01:36:12.880 align:start position:0%
to be able to be part of one of their
 
01:36:14.709 --> 01:36:14.719 align:start position:0%
their units that
 
01:36:14.719 --> 01:36:16.070 align:start position:0%
their units that
are

01:36:16.070 --> 01:36:16.080 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:36:19.510 --> 01:36:19.520 align:start position:0%
separate but equal within the prison
 
01:36:22.310 --> 01:36:22.320 align:start position:0%
i don't know the all the details on that
 
01:36:23.910 --> 01:36:23.920 align:start position:0%
and that would be an appropriate
 
01:36:25.350 --> 01:36:25.360 align:start position:0%
question to ask
 
01:36:28.070 --> 01:36:28.080 align:start position:0%
a representative from the corrections
 
01:36:30.070 --> 01:36:30.080 align:start position:0%

01:36:40.790 --> 01:36:40.800 align:start position:0%
question if you would yes um i
 
01:36:43.590 --> 01:36:43.600 align:start position:0%
you quoted an article from the daily
 
01:36:43.600 --> 01:36:44.470 align:start position:0%
you quoted an article from the daily
mail

01:36:44.470 --> 01:36:44.480 align:start position:0%
mail
 
01:36:47.669 --> 01:36:47.679 align:start position:0%
uh variously you said it was 2020 or
 
01:36:47.679 --> 01:36:49.910 align:start position:0%
uh variously you said it was 2020 or
2018.

01:36:49.910 --> 01:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
2018.
 
01:36:51.669 --> 01:36:51.679 align:start position:0%
for the committee daily mail is right up
 
01:36:53.750 --> 01:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
there with the new york post as a source
 
01:36:56.070 --> 01:36:56.080 align:start position:0%
of reliable information for those of you
 
01:36:57.910 --> 01:36:57.920 align:start position:0%
who checked the new york post
 
01:37:02.550 --> 01:37:02.560 align:start position:0%
can you give me some idea of how common
 
01:37:05.669 --> 01:37:05.679 align:start position:0%
a problem this is in new hampshire are
 
01:37:07.189 --> 01:37:07.199 align:start position:0%
we talking about
 
01:37:11.030 --> 01:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
thousands of people are we talking about
 
01:37:13.430 --> 01:37:13.440 align:start position:0%
hundreds of people are we talking about
 
01:37:17.270 --> 01:37:17.280 align:start position:0%
22 i mean how extensive a problem is
 
01:37:17.280 --> 01:37:18.229 align:start position:0%
22 i mean how extensive a problem is
this

01:37:18.229 --> 01:37:18.239 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:37:20.070 --> 01:37:20.080 align:start position:0%
thankfully we're a small state and that
 
01:37:21.669 --> 01:37:21.679 align:start position:0%
means we're going to have a small prison
 
01:37:23.910 --> 01:37:23.920 align:start position:0%
population and and
 
01:37:25.350 --> 01:37:25.360 align:start position:0%
so when you're talking about numbers
 
01:37:26.870 --> 01:37:26.880 align:start position:0%
they're not going to be the same as what
 
01:37:29.669 --> 01:37:29.679 align:start position:0%
they experience in the united kingdom
 
01:37:31.350 --> 01:37:31.360 align:start position:0%
the article that i talked about if i
 
01:37:34.629 --> 01:37:34.639 align:start position:0%
said 2018 i apologize i mean it came
 
01:37:37.350 --> 01:37:37.360 align:start position:0%
from from the the daily mail written by
 
01:37:40.229 --> 01:37:40.239 align:start position:0%
don shaw and it was published on may 18
 
01:37:40.239 --> 01:37:41.750 align:start position:0%
don shaw and it was published on may 18
2020

01:37:41.750 --> 01:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
2020
 
01:37:43.830 --> 01:37:43.840 align:start position:0%
and it referenced the united kingdom
 
01:37:46.950 --> 01:37:46.960 align:start position:0%
ministry of justice so if you do not
 
01:37:49.430 --> 01:37:49.440 align:start position:0%
trust that specific article you can of
 
01:37:51.430 --> 01:37:51.440 align:start position:0%
course go and read
 
01:37:53.830 --> 01:37:53.840 align:start position:0%
the reports that the ministry of justice
 
01:37:56.790 --> 01:37:56.800 align:start position:0%
has put out and you can go backtrack in
 
01:37:59.430 --> 01:37:59.440 align:start position:0%
that in that manner and find the correct
 
01:38:01.189 --> 01:38:01.199 align:start position:0%
information that way even if you do not
 
01:38:02.870 --> 01:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
trust that specific
 
01:38:04.950 --> 01:38:04.960 align:start position:0%
source you can of course go back to the
 
01:38:07.109 --> 01:38:07.119 align:start position:0%
united kingdom ministry of justice my
 
01:38:09.189 --> 01:38:09.199 align:start position:0%
question mr chairman follow up many in
 
01:38:10.470 --> 01:38:10.480 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
01:38:12.470 --> 01:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
i do not have that information for you
 
01:38:13.910 --> 01:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
if there's a if there is a
 
01:38:15.830 --> 01:38:15.840 align:start position:0%
representative from the corrections
 
01:38:17.590 --> 01:38:17.600 align:start position:0%
department that would be
 
01:38:19.430 --> 01:38:19.440 align:start position:0%
a person to ask those specific numbers
 
01:38:23.510 --> 01:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
of chairman thank you sir yep yep
 
01:38:26.390 --> 01:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
no uh representative canuck
 
01:38:28.550 --> 01:38:28.560 align:start position:0%
i was just curious about your comment
 
01:38:31.189 --> 01:38:31.199 align:start position:0%
about the um
 
01:38:34.470 --> 01:38:34.480 align:start position:0%
having a place to go co-ed
 
01:38:35.910 --> 01:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
which seems quite different than
 
01:38:37.830 --> 01:38:37.840 align:start position:0%
transgender identification the
 
01:38:39.510 --> 01:38:39.520 align:start position:0%
phraseology we have always been taught
 
01:38:41.750 --> 01:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
is it's a consistent and persistent
 
01:38:41.760 --> 01:38:43.270 align:start position:0%
is it's a consistent and persistent
identity

01:38:43.270 --> 01:38:43.280 align:start position:0%
identity
 
01:38:45.669 --> 01:38:45.679 align:start position:0%
identity or identification over a period
 
01:38:48.709 --> 01:38:48.719 align:start position:0%
of time not a casual today i think i am
 
01:38:50.709 --> 01:38:50.719 align:start position:0%
now suddenly a female
 
01:38:51.990 --> 01:38:52.000 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:38:54.070 --> 01:38:54.080 align:start position:0%
aren't those really quite different to
 
01:38:56.149 --> 01:38:56.159 align:start position:0%
go co-ed versus to have a person with a
 
01:38:58.310 --> 01:38:58.320 align:start position:0%
persistent and consistent belief that
 
01:39:01.990 --> 01:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:03.830 --> 01:39:03.840 align:start position:0%
speaking i look i was never in the
 
01:39:07.030 --> 01:39:07.040 align:start position:0%
corrections institutions myself but i
 
01:39:07.040 --> 01:39:08.229 align:start position:0%
corrections institutions myself but i
can

01:39:08.229 --> 01:39:08.239 align:start position:0%
can
 
01:39:10.229 --> 01:39:10.239 align:start position:0%
there are some parallels
 
01:39:12.070 --> 01:39:12.080 align:start position:0%
in a group home in the foster care
 
01:39:14.390 --> 01:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
system you're in a place you can't leave
 
01:39:16.070 --> 01:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
you don't have a choice you have to stay
 
01:39:17.590 --> 01:39:17.600 align:start position:0%
there it's
 
01:39:17.600 --> 01:39:18.310 align:start position:0%
there it's
it's

01:39:18.310 --> 01:39:18.320 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:39:19.750 --> 01:39:19.760 align:start position:0%
it's it's not
 
01:39:21.030 --> 01:39:21.040 align:start position:0%
you you'll
 
01:39:23.270 --> 01:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
face repercussions if you leave and they
 
01:39:25.430 --> 01:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
they'll be terrible and because you're
 
01:39:27.109 --> 01:39:27.119 align:start position:0%
you're forced to stay there you're
 
01:39:29.750 --> 01:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
forced to be with people you do not know
 
01:39:31.430 --> 01:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
and you don't know their intentions you
 
01:39:32.709 --> 01:39:32.719 align:start position:0%
don't know where they're coming from you
 
01:39:34.950 --> 01:39:34.960 align:start position:0%
just met them recently you hope they're
 
01:39:38.629 --> 01:39:38.639 align:start position:0%
good but you have to protect yourself
 
01:39:40.790 --> 01:39:40.800 align:start position:0%
you're gonna get hurt follow up your
 
01:39:42.229 --> 01:39:42.239 align:start position:0%
follow-up website i was actually
 
01:39:43.830 --> 01:39:43.840 align:start position:0%
speaking about the group home not about
 
01:39:45.750 --> 01:39:45.760 align:start position:0%
incarceration you used that example and
 
01:39:48.390 --> 01:39:48.400 align:start position:0%
i'm asking how does that example fit
 
01:39:51.109 --> 01:39:51.119 align:start position:0%
when we talk about going co-ed versus a
 
01:39:53.430 --> 01:39:53.440 align:start position:0%
transgender person who has a persistent
 
01:39:55.270 --> 01:39:55.280 align:start position:0%
and consistent identification as the
 
01:39:56.310 --> 01:39:56.320 align:start position:0%
other sex
 
01:39:58.550 --> 01:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
to the person to to a female that's
 
01:40:00.629 --> 01:40:00.639 align:start position:0%
that's in there and has to live there as
 
01:40:02.709 --> 01:40:02.719 align:start position:0%
i said and you can't leave and you are
 
01:40:04.629 --> 01:40:04.639 align:start position:0%
with strangers there is no difference
 
01:40:08.709 --> 01:40:08.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:11.109 --> 01:40:11.119 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:40:12.629 --> 01:40:12.639 align:start position:0%

specifically
 
01:41:11.990 --> 01:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
i'm here to talk about the high risk for
 
01:41:14.629 --> 01:41:14.639 align:start position:0%
depression suicide attempts and suicide
 
01:41:17.590 --> 01:41:17.600 align:start position:0%

01:41:22.870 --> 01:41:22.880 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:41:25.109 --> 01:41:25.119 align:start position:0%
has been designated as a national best
 
01:41:27.430 --> 01:41:27.440 align:start position:0%
practice in suicide prevention
 
01:41:31.189 --> 01:41:31.199 align:start position:0%
intervention and postvention
 
01:41:34.149 --> 01:41:34.159 align:start position:0%
um and it has been trained in over 40
 
01:41:37.910 --> 01:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
states and 35 tribal nations
 
01:41:40.310 --> 01:41:40.320 align:start position:0%
there's a chart on the
 
01:41:42.470 --> 01:41:42.480 align:start position:0%
written testimony and it shows that
 
01:41:44.790 --> 01:41:44.800 align:start position:0%
suicide is the second leading cause of
 
01:41:44.800 --> 01:41:45.669 align:start position:0%
suicide is the second leading cause of
death

01:41:45.669 --> 01:41:45.679 align:start position:0%
death
 
01:41:48.709 --> 01:41:48.719 align:start position:0%
for individuals in new hampshire ages
 
01:41:50.950 --> 01:41:50.960 align:start position:0%
10 to 34.
 
01:41:53.270 --> 01:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
it's the third leading cause of death
 
01:41:56.790 --> 01:41:56.800 align:start position:0%
for individuals ages 35 to 44
 
01:41:58.950 --> 01:41:58.960 align:start position:0%
and the fourth leading cause of death
 
01:42:02.470 --> 01:42:02.480 align:start position:0%
for individuals 45 to 54 in the state of
 
01:42:04.709 --> 01:42:04.719 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
01:42:07.430 --> 01:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
suicide deaths are only the tip of the
 
01:42:11.270 --> 01:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
iceberg in contrast to suicide attempts
 
01:42:13.510 --> 01:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
and the human and economic impact of
 
01:42:15.590 --> 01:42:15.600 align:start position:0%
suicide deaths and attempts is
 
01:42:15.600 --> 01:42:18.229 align:start position:0%
suicide deaths and attempts is
significant

01:42:18.229 --> 01:42:18.239 align:start position:0%
significant
 
01:42:22.390 --> 01:42:22.400 align:start position:0%
a small but important subgroup
 
01:42:25.030 --> 01:42:25.040 align:start position:0%
of individuals in this
 
01:42:26.709 --> 01:42:26.719 align:start position:0%
pool of statistics
 
01:42:28.310 --> 01:42:28.320 align:start position:0%
are people who are dealing with gender
 
01:42:29.990 --> 01:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
identity issues
 
01:42:31.830 --> 01:42:31.840 align:start position:0%
there's an emerging body of research
 
01:42:33.350 --> 01:42:33.360 align:start position:0%
showing that trans
 
01:42:35.910 --> 01:42:35.920 align:start position:0%
people are likely to attempt suicide at
 
01:42:38.709 --> 01:42:38.719 align:start position:0%
an alarmingly higher rate than their
 
01:42:41.990 --> 01:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
peers in the general population
 
01:42:44.870 --> 01:42:44.880 align:start position:0%
a 2021 study indicated that people who
 
01:42:46.950 --> 01:42:46.960 align:start position:0%
undergo hormone therapy or gender
 
01:42:48.870 --> 01:42:48.880 align:start position:0%
affirming surgery
 
01:42:50.629 --> 01:42:50.639 align:start position:0%
had significant reductions in
 
01:42:52.550 --> 01:42:52.560 align:start position:0%
psychological distress including
 
01:42:56.790 --> 01:42:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:59.109 --> 01:42:59.119 align:start position:0%
restricting people to
 
01:43:02.870 --> 01:43:02.880 align:start position:0%
their quote unquote biological based sex
 
01:43:05.430 --> 01:43:05.440 align:start position:0%
or their gender assignment at birth
 
01:43:07.990 --> 01:43:08.000 align:start position:0%
as laid out in the proposed bill
 
01:43:10.870 --> 01:43:10.880 align:start position:0%
is harmful to the mental health of trans
 
01:43:10.880 --> 01:43:12.470 align:start position:0%
is harmful to the mental health of trans
individuals

01:43:12.470 --> 01:43:12.480 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
01:43:14.709 --> 01:43:14.719 align:start position:0%
and as indicated in the previously
 
01:43:16.870 --> 01:43:16.880 align:start position:0%
mentioned studies that are
 
01:43:19.430 --> 01:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
included in the testimony
 
01:43:21.669 --> 01:43:21.679 align:start position:0%
it's likely to increase the risk for
 
01:43:24.390 --> 01:43:24.400 align:start position:0%
depression suicide and suicide attempts
 
01:43:27.990 --> 01:43:28.000 align:start position:0%
in trans individuals and i just want to
 
01:43:29.430 --> 01:43:29.440 align:start position:0%
say something that's been on my mind
 
01:43:31.590 --> 01:43:31.600 align:start position:0%
since last week which is
 
01:43:33.910 --> 01:43:33.920 align:start position:0%
bills like these in and of themselves
 
01:43:36.870 --> 01:43:36.880 align:start position:0%
going through the process is harmful
 
01:43:40.070 --> 01:43:40.080 align:start position:0%
to individuals who are affected by these
 
01:43:40.080 --> 01:43:41.669 align:start position:0%
to individuals who are affected by these
bills

01:43:41.669 --> 01:43:41.679 align:start position:0%
bills
 
01:43:43.750 --> 01:43:43.760 align:start position:0%
there's a bill heard last week and this
 
01:43:46.950 --> 01:43:46.960 align:start position:0%
one too that the longer they're
 
01:43:50.950 --> 01:43:50.960 align:start position:0%
in the house and discussed and voted on
 
01:43:52.470 --> 01:43:52.480 align:start position:0%
it sends a message
 
01:43:54.950 --> 01:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
to the trans community um
 
01:43:57.510 --> 01:43:57.520 align:start position:0%
and so i just want
 
01:43:59.189 --> 01:43:59.199 align:start position:0%
i just want individuals to think about
 
01:44:01.750 --> 01:44:01.760 align:start position:0%
that that the longer it stays in this
 
01:44:01.760 --> 01:44:03.669 align:start position:0%
that that the longer it stays in this
committee

01:44:03.669 --> 01:44:03.679 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:44:05.830 --> 01:44:05.840 align:start position:0%
the more harm it's going to do thank you
 
01:44:07.830 --> 01:44:07.840 align:start position:0%
ms stevens will you take questions i
 
01:44:09.350 --> 01:44:09.360 align:start position:0%
will take questions related to my
 
01:44:12.950 --> 01:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:12.960 --> 01:44:14.229 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:44:14.229 --> 01:44:14.239 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:44:16.149 --> 01:44:16.159 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:44:18.950 --> 01:44:18.960 align:start position:0%
being here and taking questions um i i
 
01:44:21.510 --> 01:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
appreciate the
 
01:44:23.669 --> 01:44:23.679 align:start position:0%
not appreciate i'm incredibly saddened
 
01:44:25.109 --> 01:44:25.119 align:start position:0%
and troubled by how much higher the
 
01:44:28.629 --> 01:44:28.639 align:start position:0%
suicide rate is in trans in trans people
 
01:44:30.149 --> 01:44:30.159 align:start position:0%
and i
 
01:44:31.669 --> 01:44:31.679 align:start position:0%
think that that is something that we
 
01:44:33.350 --> 01:44:33.360 align:start position:0%
need to make sure that we never ignore
 
01:44:35.830 --> 01:44:35.840 align:start position:0%
and we never gloss over i'm curious as
 
01:44:35.840 --> 01:44:37.189 align:start position:0%
and we never gloss over i'm curious as
to

01:44:37.189 --> 01:44:37.199 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:44:39.510 --> 01:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
whether you believe that continuing to
 
01:44:42.629 --> 01:44:42.639 align:start position:0%
recognize the biologic sex and the
 
01:44:43.510 --> 01:44:43.520 align:start position:0%
and the
 
01:44:45.430 --> 01:44:45.440 align:start position:0%
recognized gender
 
01:44:46.950 --> 01:44:46.960 align:start position:0%
if that's something that might actually
 
01:44:49.750 --> 01:44:49.760 align:start position:0%
lead to catching more suicide ideation
 
01:44:51.590 --> 01:44:51.600 align:start position:0%
within the criminal justice system or
 
01:44:54.310 --> 01:44:54.320 align:start position:0%
anywhere else because it is a specific
 
01:44:56.149 --> 01:44:56.159 align:start position:0%
risk factor and i'm curious if you've
 
01:44:58.229 --> 01:44:58.239 align:start position:0%
thought about that i don't quite
 
01:45:00.149 --> 01:45:00.159 align:start position:0%
understand are you tell are you asking
 
01:45:00.159 --> 01:45:01.430 align:start position:0%
understand are you tell are you asking
if

01:45:01.430 --> 01:45:01.440 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:45:01.440 --> 01:45:02.390 align:start position:0%
if
if

01:45:02.390 --> 01:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:45:04.709 --> 01:45:04.719 align:start position:0%
trans individuals are identified as
 
01:45:07.350 --> 01:45:07.360 align:start position:0%
trans going through the process
 
01:45:07.360 --> 01:45:08.790 align:start position:0%
trans going through the process
that

01:45:08.790 --> 01:45:08.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:45:11.590 --> 01:45:11.600 align:start position:0%
it would be easier to keep an eye on
 
01:45:14.070 --> 01:45:14.080 align:start position:0%
them for suicidal ideation is that what
 
01:45:15.270 --> 01:45:15.280 align:start position:0%
you're asking
 
01:45:17.189 --> 01:45:17.199 align:start position:0%
my question is the health risks there's
 
01:45:19.510 --> 01:45:19.520 align:start position:0%
both suicide and also
 
01:45:22.470 --> 01:45:22.480 align:start position:0%
men trans men have a two times increased
 
01:45:25.109 --> 01:45:25.119 align:start position:0%
risk of cancer and if their specific
 
01:45:26.709 --> 01:45:26.719 align:start position:0%
health needs
 
01:45:26.719 --> 01:45:27.510 align:start position:0%
health needs
are

01:45:27.510 --> 01:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:45:29.669 --> 01:45:29.679 align:start position:0%
ignored if we don't also recognize their
 
01:45:36.470 --> 01:45:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:38.070 --> 01:45:38.080 align:start position:0%
i know it's a hard question it is a hard
 
01:45:40.470 --> 01:45:40.480 align:start position:0%
question because you know with with the
 
01:45:40.480 --> 01:45:42.229 align:start position:0%
question because you know with with the
privacy

01:45:42.229 --> 01:45:42.239 align:start position:0%
privacy
 
01:45:44.629 --> 01:45:44.639 align:start position:0%
laws in this state you know a couple
 
01:45:46.229 --> 01:45:46.239 align:start position:0%
years ago it was introduced into the
 
01:45:48.870 --> 01:45:48.880 align:start position:0%
constitution you know i think that a
 
01:45:51.510 --> 01:45:51.520 align:start position:0%
person and their doctor
 
01:45:53.350 --> 01:45:53.360 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of reasons that people
 
01:45:56.950 --> 01:45:56.960 align:start position:0%
are at higher risk for lots of
 
01:45:59.270 --> 01:45:59.280 align:start position:0%
different medical conditions a lot of
 
01:46:01.510 --> 01:46:01.520 align:start position:0%
family history goes into it
 
01:46:03.430 --> 01:46:03.440 align:start position:0%
and it's up to that individual and their
 
01:46:03.440 --> 01:46:04.470 align:start position:0%
and it's up to that individual and their
doctor

01:46:04.470 --> 01:46:04.480 align:start position:0%
doctor
 
01:46:06.870 --> 01:46:06.880 align:start position:0%
to discuss what those are and i think
 
01:46:10.229 --> 01:46:10.239 align:start position:0%
that that is left best left between
 
01:46:13.270 --> 01:46:13.280 align:start position:0%
somebody and their doctor to discuss
 
01:46:15.669 --> 01:46:15.679 align:start position:0%
their entire health history and what
 
01:46:17.990 --> 01:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
they might be at risk for
 
01:46:19.030 --> 01:46:19.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:46:21.910 --> 01:46:21.920 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions
 
01:46:24.550 --> 01:46:24.560 align:start position:0%
representative ackman thank you mr chair
 
01:46:27.109 --> 01:46:27.119 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
01:46:28.950 --> 01:46:28.960 align:start position:0%
i have to say i'm i'm a little shocked
 
01:46:32.629 --> 01:46:32.639 align:start position:0%
by our last statement there um
 
01:46:32.639 --> 01:46:34.870 align:start position:0%
by our last statement there um
the

01:46:34.870 --> 01:46:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:36.790 --> 01:46:36.800 align:start position:0%
here in the house we received all kinds
 
01:46:39.430 --> 01:46:39.440 align:start position:0%
of bills this is where we hash out ideas
 
01:46:41.910 --> 01:46:41.920 align:start position:0%
and and work on solutions some never
 
01:46:43.030 --> 01:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
make it
 
01:46:45.669 --> 01:46:45.679 align:start position:0%
um some do but we have to be able to
 
01:46:48.390 --> 01:46:48.400 align:start position:0%
just to discuss things these things
 
01:46:50.149 --> 01:46:50.159 align:start position:0%
am i wrong in thinking that you just
 
01:46:50.159 --> 01:46:51.030 align:start position:0%
am i wrong in thinking that you just
were

01:46:51.030 --> 01:46:51.040 align:start position:0%
were
 
01:46:52.870 --> 01:46:52.880 align:start position:0%
kind of telling us not to discuss these
 
01:46:55.030 --> 01:46:55.040 align:start position:0%
things in essence censoring us from from
 
01:46:57.189 --> 01:46:57.199 align:start position:0%
talking about this bill because we may
 
01:46:59.830 --> 01:46:59.840 align:start position:0%
offend somebody
 
01:47:02.310 --> 01:47:02.320 align:start position:0%
that was not my point my point was just
 
01:47:04.629 --> 01:47:04.639 align:start position:0%
to provide education
 
01:47:04.639 --> 01:47:05.590 align:start position:0%
to provide education
that

01:47:05.590 --> 01:47:05.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:47:08.310 --> 01:47:08.320 align:start position:0%
just bills like this coming forward can
 
01:47:10.470 --> 01:47:10.480 align:start position:0%
be harmful
 
01:47:12.870 --> 01:47:12.880 align:start position:0%
you can take that for what what you will
 
01:47:14.229 --> 01:47:14.239 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
01:47:16.149 --> 01:47:16.159 align:start position:0%
it's it's a fact
 
01:47:16.159 --> 01:47:17.030 align:start position:0%
it's it's a fact
and

01:47:17.030 --> 01:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:47:17.040 --> 01:47:18.470 align:start position:0%
and
um

01:47:18.470 --> 01:47:18.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:21.430 --> 01:47:21.440 align:start position:0%
so i just wanted to present that
 
01:47:22.870 --> 01:47:22.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:47:24.310 --> 01:47:24.320 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
 
01:47:24.320 --> 01:47:25.350 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
pearson

01:47:25.350 --> 01:47:25.360 align:start position:0%
pearson
 
01:47:29.350 --> 01:47:29.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh do you believe
 
01:47:30.790 --> 01:47:30.800 align:start position:0%
that the longer
 
01:47:33.270 --> 01:47:33.280 align:start position:0%
bills like this are in committee before
 
01:47:35.750 --> 01:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
being passed into law
 
01:47:38.870 --> 01:47:38.880 align:start position:0%
the more female athletes will lose
 
01:47:40.709 --> 01:47:40.719 align:start position:0%
in the sports for which they train so
 
01:47:40.719 --> 01:47:41.510 align:start position:0%
in the sports for which they train so
hard

01:47:41.510 --> 01:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
hard
 
01:47:44.709 --> 01:47:44.719 align:start position:0%
and title ix the liberalism of its day
 
01:47:48.390 --> 01:47:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:50.470 --> 01:47:50.480 align:start position:0%
that's not something that i can comment
 
01:47:55.189 --> 01:47:55.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:57.510 --> 01:47:57.520 align:start position:0%
nami new hampshire doesn't really weigh
 
01:48:00.070 --> 01:48:00.080 align:start position:0%
into the fairness of sports so i don't
 
01:48:01.910 --> 01:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
have any information on that but there
 
01:48:05.590 --> 01:48:05.600 align:start position:0%
might be some other folks that do
 
01:48:07.189 --> 01:48:07.199 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much
 
01:48:08.790 --> 01:48:08.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:48:11.109 --> 01:48:11.119 align:start position:0%
oh excuse me representative gay thank
 
01:48:14.149 --> 01:48:14.159 align:start position:0%
you mr chair um would you have any
 
01:48:14.159 --> 01:48:15.590 align:start position:0%
you mr chair um would you have any
objection

01:48:15.590 --> 01:48:15.600 align:start position:0%
objection
 
01:48:19.750 --> 01:48:19.760 align:start position:0%
to the sports section of this proposed
 
01:48:19.760 --> 01:48:20.870 align:start position:0%
to the sports section of this proposed
bill

01:48:20.870 --> 01:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:48:23.669 --> 01:48:23.679 align:start position:0%
being retained
 
01:48:25.510 --> 01:48:25.520 align:start position:0%
as opposed to
 
01:48:28.709 --> 01:48:28.719 align:start position:0%
the other bill the other two sections
 
01:48:31.830 --> 01:48:31.840 align:start position:0%
being dealt with individually as
 
01:48:34.070 --> 01:48:34.080 align:start position:0%
because they all seem to be very
 
01:48:38.229 --> 01:48:38.239 align:start position:0%
different from absolutely stupid too
 
01:48:40.709 --> 01:48:40.719 align:start position:0%
important so do you have any problem
 
01:48:43.189 --> 01:48:43.199 align:start position:0%
with that section with the sports after
 
01:48:44.790 --> 01:48:44.800 align:start position:0%
people like
 
01:48:47.430 --> 01:48:47.440 align:start position:0%
like a very famous trans
 
01:48:48.790 --> 01:48:48.800 align:start position:0%
athlete has
 
01:48:48.800 --> 01:48:52.070 align:start position:0%
athlete has
supported

01:48:52.070 --> 01:48:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:55.350 --> 01:48:55.360 align:start position:0%
i'm not able to weigh in on pulling this
 
01:48:55.360 --> 01:48:56.470 align:start position:0%
i'm not able to weigh in on pulling this
apart

01:48:56.470 --> 01:48:56.480 align:start position:0%
apart
 
01:48:57.990 --> 01:48:58.000 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:49:00.870 --> 01:49:00.880 align:start position:0%
on its face is harmful um
 
01:49:02.790 --> 01:49:02.800 align:start position:0%
and i
 
01:49:05.510 --> 01:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
all three parts of it are harmful um and
 
01:49:10.870 --> 01:49:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:13.189 --> 01:49:13.199 align:start position:0%
okay one one more question
 
01:49:15.109 --> 01:49:15.119 align:start position:0%
would you believe
 
01:49:16.950 --> 01:49:16.960 align:start position:0%
it is very harmful
 
01:49:19.750 --> 01:49:19.760 align:start position:0%
to excellent women in sports
 
01:49:21.510 --> 01:49:21.520 align:start position:0%
who are now losing
 
01:49:23.350 --> 01:49:23.360 align:start position:0%
to biological males
 
01:49:25.109 --> 01:49:25.119 align:start position:0%
would you believe that is harmful and
 
01:49:29.430 --> 01:49:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:31.270 --> 01:49:31.280 align:start position:0%
that i don't know but i'd be more than
 
01:49:33.189 --> 01:49:33.199 align:start position:0%
happy to take a look at any studies that
 
01:49:37.510 --> 01:49:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:40.310 --> 01:49:40.320 align:start position:0%
thank you ms stevens thank you
 
01:49:45.750 --> 01:49:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:47.510 --> 01:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
she may approach the bench thank you
 
01:49:49.510 --> 01:49:49.520 align:start position:0%
very much and
 
01:49:51.589 --> 01:49:51.599 align:start position:0%
three minutes thank you
 
01:49:53.669 --> 01:49:53.679 align:start position:0%
good morning everyone thank you mr
 
01:49:55.189 --> 01:49:55.199 align:start position:0%
chairman and to the members of this
 
01:49:57.270 --> 01:49:57.280 align:start position:0%
committee for giving me the opportunity
 
01:49:59.270 --> 01:49:59.280 align:start position:0%
to speak with you today my name is
 
01:50:01.350 --> 01:50:01.360 align:start position:0%
caroline levitt i am currently a
 
01:50:03.589 --> 01:50:03.599 align:start position:0%
republican candidate for the nomination
 
01:50:06.470 --> 01:50:06.480 align:start position:0%
in the first district but today i am
 
01:50:09.669 --> 01:50:09.679 align:start position:0%
with you as a concerned lifelong citizen
 
01:50:12.310 --> 01:50:12.320 align:start position:0%
of this state and a former competitive
 
01:50:12.320 --> 01:50:13.510 align:start position:0%
of this state and a former competitive
athlete

01:50:13.510 --> 01:50:13.520 align:start position:0%
athlete
 
01:50:15.669 --> 01:50:15.679 align:start position:0%
aside from my family our small
 
01:50:18.709 --> 01:50:18.719 align:start position:0%
businesses my friends and my education
 
01:50:21.510 --> 01:50:21.520 align:start position:0%
athletics was a major part of my
 
01:50:23.510 --> 01:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
upbringing in this state
 
01:50:26.709 --> 01:50:26.719 align:start position:0%
my innate passion for softball in many
 
01:50:29.830 --> 01:50:29.840 align:start position:0%
many years of hard work earned me an
 
01:50:32.229 --> 01:50:32.239 align:start position:0%
athletic scholarship to compete for the
 
01:50:36.310 --> 01:50:36.320 align:start position:0%
ncaa division two at st anselm college
 
01:50:39.510 --> 01:50:39.520 align:start position:0%
i spent years making sacrifices and
 
01:50:42.149 --> 01:50:42.159 align:start position:0%
working tirelessly to achieve my
 
01:50:44.390 --> 01:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
athletic goals and compete at the
 
01:50:47.830 --> 01:50:47.840 align:start position:0%
highest level that i possibly could
 
01:50:50.870 --> 01:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
and it's difficult for me to imagine if
 
01:50:54.550 --> 01:50:54.560 align:start position:0%
a biological man who was no doubt bigger
 
01:50:57.109 --> 01:50:57.119 align:start position:0%
stronger and inherently physically
 
01:51:00.149 --> 01:51:00.159 align:start position:0%
superior to me had taken my well-earned
 
01:51:02.709 --> 01:51:02.719 align:start position:0%
starting position of third baseman on my
 
01:51:05.589 --> 01:51:05.599 align:start position:0%
middle school high school or especially
 
01:51:07.669 --> 01:51:07.679 align:start position:0%
collegiate softball teams
 
01:51:09.830 --> 01:51:09.840 align:start position:0%
it's difficult for me to imagine as a
 
01:51:12.790 --> 01:51:12.800 align:start position:0%
young woman standing at third base just
 
01:51:15.510 --> 01:51:15.520 align:start position:0%
feet away from home plate being forced
 
01:51:17.669 --> 01:51:17.679 align:start position:0%
to face a man as he steps up to the
 
01:51:21.109 --> 01:51:21.119 align:start position:0%
plate to hit the ball and right now in
 
01:51:23.669 --> 01:51:23.679 align:start position:0%
our state that is a possibility that
 
01:51:26.149 --> 01:51:26.159 align:start position:0%
women and girls may face given our
 
01:51:27.750 --> 01:51:27.760 align:start position:0%
existing law
 
01:51:30.470 --> 01:51:30.480 align:start position:0%
recently we have seen many instances of
 
01:51:32.790 --> 01:51:32.800 align:start position:0%
injustices against biological women in
 
01:51:35.510 --> 01:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
athletics as biological men unfairly
 
01:51:38.550 --> 01:51:38.560 align:start position:0%
compete against them and win big time on
 
01:51:41.109 --> 01:51:41.119 align:start position:0%
the track in the swimming pool and on
 
01:51:42.709 --> 01:51:42.719 align:start position:0%
the court
 
01:51:44.550 --> 01:51:44.560 align:start position:0%
the most recent and perhaps egregious
 
01:51:46.950 --> 01:51:46.960 align:start position:0%
example is the case of leah thomas the
 
01:51:49.189 --> 01:51:49.199 align:start position:0%
university of pennsylvania swimmer who
 
01:51:52.310 --> 01:51:52.320 align:start position:0%
continues to crush her female opponents
 
01:51:54.950 --> 01:51:54.960 align:start position:0%
and break records by unprecedented
 
01:51:54.960 --> 01:51:55.990 align:start position:0%
and break records by unprecedented
margins

01:51:55.990 --> 01:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
margins
 
01:51:57.750 --> 01:51:57.760 align:start position:0%
how is this fair
 
01:52:00.149 --> 01:52:00.159 align:start position:0%
anyone with a little bit of common sense
 
01:52:02.149 --> 01:52:02.159 align:start position:0%
will look at leah thomas's physical
 
01:52:02.159 --> 01:52:03.430 align:start position:0%
will look at leah thomas's physical
stature

01:52:03.430 --> 01:52:03.440 align:start position:0%
stature
 
01:52:04.709 --> 01:52:04.719 align:start position:0%
their hands
 
01:52:04.719 --> 01:52:05.589 align:start position:0%
their hands
feet

01:52:05.589 --> 01:52:05.599 align:start position:0%
feet
 
01:52:08.629 --> 01:52:08.639 align:start position:0%
lungs and recognize that leah thomas
 
01:52:11.270 --> 01:52:11.280 align:start position:0%
should not be competing against women
 
01:52:14.550 --> 01:52:14.560 align:start position:0%
but we live in a state and a country in
 
01:52:16.229 --> 01:52:16.239 align:start position:0%
which this is allowed to occur because
 
01:52:19.350 --> 01:52:19.360 align:start position:0%
our leaders at all levels have failed to
 
01:52:22.310 --> 01:52:22.320 align:start position:0%
stand up for the basic truth
 
01:52:24.790 --> 01:52:24.800 align:start position:0%
that biological women and men are
 
01:52:26.470 --> 01:52:26.480 align:start position:0%
inherently different
 
01:52:28.070 --> 01:52:28.080 align:start position:0%
but equal
 
01:52:30.390 --> 01:52:30.400 align:start position:0%
today you all have an opportunity to
 
01:52:33.589 --> 01:52:33.599 align:start position:0%
stand up for this basic truth you all
 
01:52:36.310 --> 01:52:36.320 align:start position:0%
have an opportunity to ensure that such
 
01:52:39.109 --> 01:52:39.119 align:start position:0%
unfairness is not allowed in our great
 
01:52:41.589 --> 01:52:41.599 align:start position:0%
state the bill before you today provides
 
01:52:44.310 --> 01:52:44.320 align:start position:0%
necessary guard rails to our law which
 
01:52:47.430 --> 01:52:47.440 align:start position:0%
align with federal law title ix which
 
01:52:49.750 --> 01:52:49.760 align:start position:0%
exists because women championed it and
 
01:52:52.070 --> 01:52:52.080 align:start position:0%
pioneered it for decades and it was
 
01:52:54.950 --> 01:52:54.960 align:start position:0%
signed over 40 years ago and we live in
 
01:52:57.430 --> 01:52:57.440 align:start position:0%
a country now where it is being violated
 
01:52:59.510 --> 01:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
before our very eyes
 
01:52:59.520 --> 01:53:00.629 align:start position:0%
before our very eyes
lastly

01:53:00.629 --> 01:53:00.639 align:start position:0%
lastly
 
01:53:02.070 --> 01:53:02.080 align:start position:0%
i would just like to add that the bill
 
01:53:03.990 --> 01:53:04.000 align:start position:0%
before you today goes much further than
 
01:53:06.310 --> 01:53:06.320 align:start position:0%
the field or the locker room or the
 
01:53:07.510 --> 01:53:07.520 align:start position:0%
prison cell
 
01:53:10.629 --> 01:53:10.639 align:start position:0%
competing fairly and safely and
 
01:53:13.589 --> 01:53:13.599 align:start position:0%
competitively in athletics made me who i
 
01:53:16.070 --> 01:53:16.080 align:start position:0%
am it gave me lifelong friendships
 
01:53:18.390 --> 01:53:18.400 align:start position:0%
provided me with great memories but most
 
01:53:20.790 --> 01:53:20.800 align:start position:0%
importantly it ingrained in unwavering
 
01:53:22.470 --> 01:53:22.480 align:start position:0%
inner confidence and steadfast
 
01:53:24.950 --> 01:53:24.960 align:start position:0%
determination in me to achieve my goals
 
01:53:27.510 --> 01:53:27.520 align:start position:0%
i want every young girl in this state to
 
01:53:29.430 --> 01:53:29.440 align:start position:0%
have the athletic opportunities that i
 
01:53:29.440 --> 01:53:30.229 align:start position:0%
have the athletic opportunities that i
did

did
 
01:53:32.310 --> 01:53:32.320 align:start position:0%
so as a woman as a lifelong new
 
01:53:34.470 --> 01:53:34.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire citizen and a former athlete
 
01:53:37.189 --> 01:53:37.199 align:start position:0%
who has competed at a very high level
 
01:53:39.750 --> 01:53:39.760 align:start position:0%
please stand up for truth today please
 
01:53:42.310 --> 01:53:42.320 align:start position:0%
support house bill 1180 and when i'm
 
01:53:44.310 --> 01:53:44.320 align:start position:0%
elected to serve in congress i pledge to
 
01:53:46.070 --> 01:53:46.080 align:start position:0%
stand with you at the federal level
 
01:53:48.310 --> 01:53:48.320 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you ms levitt
 
01:53:50.870 --> 01:53:50.880 align:start position:0%
do we have questions from the committee
 
01:53:53.510 --> 01:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
representative cannon
 
01:53:55.189 --> 01:53:55.199 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
01:53:58.629 --> 01:53:58.639 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
01:53:59.990 --> 01:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
how often
 
01:54:01.910 --> 01:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
01:54:03.830 --> 01:54:03.840 align:start position:0%
has this been an issue
 
01:54:05.030 --> 01:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
we certainly have not seen the
 
01:54:07.750 --> 01:54:07.760 align:start position:0%
ramifications of this in our state yet
 
01:54:10.229 --> 01:54:10.239 align:start position:0%
but as our law stands and as we see the
 
01:54:12.629 --> 01:54:12.639 align:start position:0%
trend of this across the country taking
 
01:54:12.639 --> 01:54:13.910 align:start position:0%
trend of this across the country taking
place

01:54:13.910 --> 01:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
place
 
01:54:16.709 --> 01:54:16.719 align:start position:0%
i can imagine the flood gates will open
 
01:54:18.470 --> 01:54:18.480 align:start position:0%
and we have to stop this in its tracks
 
01:54:21.030 --> 01:54:21.040 align:start position:0%
before it occurs why should we wait for
 
01:54:22.709 --> 01:54:22.719 align:start position:0%
a young woman to be unfairly competed
 
01:54:24.709 --> 01:54:24.719 align:start position:0%
against on the track on the softball
 
01:54:26.629 --> 01:54:26.639 align:start position:0%
field or in the swimming pool why should
 
01:54:28.870 --> 01:54:28.880 align:start position:0%
we wait for that unfairness to occur why
 
01:54:30.790 --> 01:54:30.800 align:start position:0%
should we not take action now to stand
 
01:54:32.229 --> 01:54:32.239 align:start position:0%
up for the basic truths that i just
 
01:54:35.350 --> 01:54:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:37.830 --> 01:54:37.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:54:40.149 --> 01:54:40.159 align:start position:0%
thank you for uh representative gay
 
01:54:42.870 --> 01:54:42.880 align:start position:0%
uh i'll ask the thank you mr chair and
 
01:54:44.629 --> 01:54:44.639 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question i'll
 
01:54:47.109 --> 01:54:47.119 align:start position:0%
ask the same question do you have any
 
01:54:49.750 --> 01:54:49.760 align:start position:0%
problem with this uh bill being
 
01:54:52.229 --> 01:54:52.239 align:start position:0%
separated into portions so that we can
 
01:54:56.790 --> 01:54:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:58.629 --> 01:54:58.639 align:start position:0%
can you explain your thought process on
 
01:54:59.990 --> 01:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
that please
 
01:55:01.510 --> 01:55:01.520 align:start position:0%
representative if you don't mind there
 
01:55:04.550 --> 01:55:04.560 align:start position:0%
are three parts to this
 
01:55:04.560 --> 01:55:05.990 align:start position:0%
are three parts to this
bathrooms

01:55:05.990 --> 01:55:06.000 align:start position:0%

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:07.270 align:start position:0%

sports

01:55:09.109 --> 01:55:09.119 align:start position:0%
sports
 
01:55:11.669 --> 01:55:11.679 align:start position:0%
do you have any problem separating out
 
01:55:13.109 --> 01:55:13.119 align:start position:0%
sports into a
 
01:55:14.950 --> 01:55:14.960 align:start position:0%
separate bill
 
01:55:17.270 --> 01:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
the truth is relevant in all three
 
01:55:19.109 --> 01:55:19.119 align:start position:0%
instances the truth is the same in all
 
01:55:20.950 --> 01:55:20.960 align:start position:0%
three instances like i said whether it's
 
01:55:22.470 --> 01:55:22.480 align:start position:0%
on the field whether it's on the track
 
01:55:24.709 --> 01:55:24.719 align:start position:0%
whether it's on the court biological men
 
01:55:26.550 --> 01:55:26.560 align:start position:0%
and women are inherently different and
 
01:55:29.270 --> 01:55:29.280 align:start position:0%
the ramifications in all three areas
 
01:55:31.589 --> 01:55:31.599 align:start position:0%
that this bill includes
 
01:55:33.669 --> 01:55:33.679 align:start position:0%
it doesn't change that truth and so i
 
01:55:35.430 --> 01:55:35.440 align:start position:0%
think the legislation as it stands is
 
01:55:37.350 --> 01:55:37.360 align:start position:0%
appropriate and again i encourage
 
01:55:39.589 --> 01:55:39.599 align:start position:0%
everyone to support it
 
01:55:43.109 --> 01:55:43.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:45.589 --> 01:55:45.599 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:55:49.589 --> 01:55:49.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:53.589 --> 01:55:53.599 align:start position:0%
the initials lgbt question mark
 
01:55:55.830 --> 01:55:55.840 align:start position:0%
i sometimes get those all mixed up but
 
01:55:57.189 --> 01:55:57.199 align:start position:0%
they all
 
01:56:00.229 --> 01:56:00.239 align:start position:0%
have something in common
 
01:56:03.189 --> 01:56:03.199 align:start position:0%
in terms of transgender
 
01:56:05.750 --> 01:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
all of these individuals
 
01:56:07.910 --> 01:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
are subject to
 
01:56:10.390 --> 01:56:10.400 align:start position:0%
severe stigma
 
01:56:12.390 --> 01:56:12.400 align:start position:0%
in our society
 
01:56:15.750 --> 01:56:15.760 align:start position:0%
and i'm concerned that this legislation
 
01:56:17.510 --> 01:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
is going to
 
01:56:21.589 --> 01:56:21.599 align:start position:0%
increase that stigma uh to a point
 
01:56:21.599 --> 01:56:23.510 align:start position:0%
increase that stigma uh to a point
obviously

01:56:23.510 --> 01:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
01:56:26.070 --> 01:56:26.080 align:start position:0%
individuals in these various categories
 
01:56:28.229 --> 01:56:28.239 align:start position:0%
are like every other human being they're
 
01:56:28.239 --> 01:56:29.589 align:start position:0%
are like every other human being they're
subject

01:56:29.589 --> 01:56:29.599 align:start position:0%
subject
 
01:56:29.599 --> 01:56:30.870 align:start position:0%
subject
to

01:56:30.870 --> 01:56:30.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:56:30.880 --> 01:56:32.390 align:start position:0%
to
difficulties

01:56:32.390 --> 01:56:32.400 align:start position:0%
difficulties
 
01:56:34.629 --> 01:56:34.639 align:start position:0%
including mental health problems and
 
01:56:36.950 --> 01:56:36.960 align:start position:0%
we've heard about suicide
 
01:56:39.910 --> 01:56:39.920 align:start position:0%
so that i'm very concerned and i hope
 
01:56:41.350 --> 01:56:41.360 align:start position:0%
you are too
 
01:56:43.430 --> 01:56:43.440 align:start position:0%
that we don't increase
 
01:56:43.440 --> 01:56:44.390 align:start position:0%
that we don't increase
the

01:56:44.390 --> 01:56:44.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:56:47.990 --> 01:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
stigma that already exists but in fact
 
01:56:49.830 --> 01:56:49.840 align:start position:0%
are trying to
 
01:56:52.470 --> 01:56:52.480 align:start position:0%
alleviate rather than
 
01:56:52.480 --> 01:56:53.430 align:start position:0%
alleviate rather than
yeah

01:56:53.430 --> 01:56:53.440 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:56:56.070 --> 01:56:56.080 align:start position:0%
would you agree
 
01:56:56.080 --> 01:56:57.030 align:start position:0%
would you agree
you

01:56:57.030 --> 01:56:57.040 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:56:59.990 --> 01:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
of course and as the speakers prior to
 
01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:01.109 align:start position:0%
of course and as the speakers prior to
me

01:57:01.109 --> 01:57:01.119 align:start position:0%
me
 
01:57:04.149 --> 01:57:04.159 align:start position:0%
mentioned we don't want to see anyone
 
01:57:05.990 --> 01:57:06.000 align:start position:0%
feeling that way we don't want anyone in
 
01:57:08.070 --> 01:57:08.080 align:start position:0%
our state to suffer from mental health
 
01:57:09.430 --> 01:57:09.440 align:start position:0%
issues and we certainly don't want to
 
01:57:12.629 --> 01:57:12.639 align:start position:0%
see people taking their own lives
 
01:57:16.550 --> 01:57:16.560 align:start position:0%
but again i stand for the basic inherent
 
01:57:19.189 --> 01:57:19.199 align:start position:0%
truths that i mentioned that biological
 
01:57:22.229 --> 01:57:22.239 align:start position:0%
men and women are inherently different
 
01:57:23.910 --> 01:57:23.920 align:start position:0%
and we should not be allowing such
 
01:57:26.790 --> 01:57:26.800 align:start position:0%
injustice to occur in our state
 
01:57:26.800 --> 01:57:29.830 align:start position:0%
injustice to occur in our state
period

01:57:29.830 --> 01:57:29.840 align:start position:0%

lot about the path toward equality for

transgender people here in new hampshire
 
01:58:41.910 --> 01:58:41.920 align:start position:0%

about it from others who are testifying

about it from others who are testifying
today

01:58:44.390 --> 01:58:44.400 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:58:47.430 --> 01:58:47.440 align:start position:0%
in 2018 and 2019 after years of
 
01:58:50.470 --> 01:58:50.480 align:start position:0%
bipartisan effort this body passed
 
01:58:52.550 --> 01:58:52.560 align:start position:0%
legislation to protect the rights of
 
01:58:54.870 --> 01:58:54.880 align:start position:0%
transgender people in new hampshire
 
01:58:58.870 --> 01:58:58.880 align:start position:0%
in 2020 and 2021 efforts to undermine
 
01:59:00.870 --> 01:59:00.880 align:start position:0%
those protections specifically aimed at
 
01:59:03.669 --> 01:59:03.679 align:start position:0%
children have been itled
 
01:59:06.229 --> 01:59:06.239 align:start position:0%
here we are again in 2022 confronting
 
01:59:08.470 --> 01:59:08.480 align:start position:0%
yet another bill that's targeting
 
01:59:10.390 --> 01:59:10.400 align:start position:0%
transgender people this time the bill
 
01:59:12.390 --> 01:59:12.400 align:start position:0%
singles out vulnerable youth and
 
01:59:14.950 --> 01:59:14.960 align:start position:0%
additionally incarcerated people
 
01:59:16.470 --> 01:59:16.480 align:start position:0%
first i want to clear up something about
 
01:59:18.229 --> 01:59:18.239 align:start position:0%
what the text of the bill actually does
 
01:59:19.990 --> 01:59:20.000 align:start position:0%
versus what it does not do
 
01:59:22.070 --> 01:59:22.080 align:start position:0%
the bill does single out transgender
 
01:59:23.350 --> 01:59:23.360 align:start position:0%
people to send a message that they're
 
01:59:25.510 --> 01:59:25.520 align:start position:0%
not welcome the bill is stigmatizing and
 
01:59:28.229 --> 01:59:28.239 align:start position:0%
hostile because it draws a line around a
 
01:59:30.550 --> 01:59:30.560 align:start position:0%
category of people those whose gender
 
01:59:32.149 --> 01:59:32.159 align:start position:0%
identity is not the same as their natal
 
01:59:34.950 --> 01:59:34.960 align:start position:0%
sex and tells them that their gender is
 
01:59:39.109 --> 01:59:39.119 align:start position:0%
not valid it is absolute in its terms
 
01:59:42.629 --> 01:59:42.639 align:start position:0%
its bluntness is what belies its cruelty
 
01:59:44.310 --> 01:59:44.320 align:start position:0%
at the same time i want to mention what
 
01:59:46.310 --> 01:59:46.320 align:start position:0%
the bill does not do despite what others
 
01:59:46.320 --> 01:59:47.350 align:start position:0%
the bill does not do despite what others
have

01:59:47.350 --> 01:59:47.360 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:59:49.510 --> 01:59:49.520 align:start position:0%
suggested in this room today it does not
 
01:59:51.270 --> 01:59:51.280 align:start position:0%
change the rules for participation in
 
01:59:52.950 --> 01:59:52.960 align:start position:0%
school sports the new hampshire
 
01:59:55.109 --> 01:59:55.119 align:start position:0%
interscholastic athletics association
 
01:59:57.270 --> 01:59:57.280 align:start position:0%
sets policy for eligibility in new
 
01:59:58.790 --> 01:59:58.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire schools
 
02:00:00.790 --> 02:00:00.800 align:start position:0%
that policy directs school districts to
 
02:00:03.350 --> 02:00:03.360 align:start position:0%
look holistically at a student's daily
 
02:00:05.030 --> 02:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
life in the community to determine
 
02:00:06.550 --> 02:00:06.560 align:start position:0%
eligibility for participation on a
 
02:00:09.189 --> 02:00:09.199 align:start position:0%
sex-separated team birth certificates
 
02:00:10.550 --> 02:00:10.560 align:start position:0%
and driver's license they're not even
 
02:00:13.109 --> 02:00:13.119 align:start position:0%
mentioned in the policy sure a birth
 
02:00:15.109 --> 02:00:15.119 align:start position:0%
certificate might provide some evidence
 
02:00:16.629 --> 02:00:16.639 align:start position:0%
of a student's consistent assertion of
 
02:00:19.109 --> 02:00:19.119 align:start position:0%
their gender identity but nothing in the
 
02:00:21.109 --> 02:00:21.119 align:start position:0%
policy directs school officials to rely
 
02:00:23.109 --> 02:00:23.119 align:start position:0%
on a birth certificate i want to add
 
02:00:25.669 --> 02:00:25.679 align:start position:0%
that if this bill were a renewed effort
 
02:00:27.189 --> 02:00:27.199 align:start position:0%
to prohibit transgender girls from
 
02:00:29.350 --> 02:00:29.360 align:start position:0%
playing school sports that bill would be
 
02:00:31.910 --> 02:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
in violation of house rule 36e which
 
02:00:34.070 --> 02:00:34.080 align:start position:0%
prohibits similar legislation from being
 
02:00:37.030 --> 02:00:37.040 align:start position:0%
introduced in a second year session
 
02:00:39.189 --> 02:00:39.199 align:start position:0%
and a bill was already introduced last
 
02:00:41.270 --> 02:00:41.280 align:start position:0%
year to override the policy and the
 
02:00:44.550 --> 02:00:44.560 align:start position:0%
current policy and that bill was itled
 
02:00:45.990 --> 02:00:46.000 align:start position:0%
the last thing i'd like to explain is
 
02:00:48.870 --> 02:00:48.880 align:start position:0%
that hb 1180 is unconstitutional
 
02:00:50.629 --> 02:00:50.639 align:start position:0%
the supreme court has made it very clear
 
02:00:52.470 --> 02:00:52.480 align:start position:0%
that laws of this nature cannot survive
 
02:00:53.910 --> 02:00:53.920 align:start position:0%
review under the 14th amendment to the
 
02:00:55.589 --> 02:00:55.599 align:start position:0%
u.s constitution
 
02:00:58.470 --> 02:00:58.480 align:start position:0%
back in 1992 in colorado the county of
 
02:01:00.310 --> 02:01:00.320 align:start position:0%
denver as well as the cities of aspen
 
02:01:02.070 --> 02:01:02.080 align:start position:0%
and boulder introduced protections for
 
02:01:03.189 --> 02:01:03.199 align:start position:0%
gay and lesbian people against
 
02:01:03.199 --> 02:01:04.550 align:start position:0%
gay and lesbian people against
discrimination

02:01:04.550 --> 02:01:04.560 align:start position:0%
discrimination
 
02:01:04.560 --> 02:01:05.589 align:start position:0%
discrimination
and

02:01:05.589 --> 02:01:05.599 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:01:07.030 --> 02:01:07.040 align:start position:0%
many people did not want those
 
02:01:08.950 --> 02:01:08.960 align:start position:0%
protections and there was a vote in a
 
02:01:11.750 --> 02:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
state to uh to to amend the constitution
 
02:01:15.189 --> 02:01:15.199 align:start position:0%
to prohibit protections for um lgbtq
 
02:01:15.199 --> 02:01:16.149 align:start position:0%
to prohibit protections for um lgbtq
people

02:01:16.149 --> 02:01:16.159 align:start position:0%
people
 
02:01:17.669 --> 02:01:17.679 align:start position:0%
and the supreme court ruled that that
 
02:01:19.830 --> 02:01:19.840 align:start position:0%
was unconstitutional uh the reason is
 
02:01:21.189 --> 02:01:21.199 align:start position:0%
because it singled out a politically
 
02:01:23.350 --> 02:01:23.360 align:start position:0%
vulnerable class of people imposed on
 
02:01:26.070 --> 02:01:26.080 align:start position:0%
them a quote a special disability
 
02:01:27.830 --> 02:01:27.840 align:start position:0%
the court said that this unusual method
 
02:01:29.669 --> 02:01:29.679 align:start position:0%
of singling out a group for different
 
02:01:32.470 --> 02:01:32.480 align:start position:0%
treatment proves that the bill quote is
 
02:01:34.229 --> 02:01:34.239 align:start position:0%
born of animosity toward the class of
 
02:01:36.790 --> 02:01:36.800 align:start position:0%
persons protect affected now i'm not
 
02:01:38.550 --> 02:01:38.560 align:start position:0%
saying that every law that could
 
02:01:40.149 --> 02:01:40.159 align:start position:0%
possibly impact transgender people in
 
02:01:41.910 --> 02:01:41.920 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is automatically rooted in
 
02:01:43.589 --> 02:01:43.599 align:start position:0%
animus that's not what i'm saying in
 
02:01:45.109 --> 02:01:45.119 align:start position:0%
fact i've testified before this very
 
02:01:47.030 --> 02:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
committee on other bills and i've never
 
02:01:49.830 --> 02:01:49.840 align:start position:0%
previously claimed that any legislation
 
02:01:51.910 --> 02:01:51.920 align:start position:0%
legislators intent is uh to
 
02:01:53.669 --> 02:01:53.679 align:start position:0%
intentionally harm transgender people
 
02:01:55.189 --> 02:01:55.199 align:start position:0%
but this bill this bill is different
 
02:01:58.950 --> 02:01:58.960 align:start position:0%
hb1180 serves no valid purpose at all
 
02:02:00.470 --> 02:02:00.480 align:start position:0%
other than to stigmatize and
 
02:02:03.030 --> 02:02:03.040 align:start position:0%
delegitimize uh transgender people
 
02:02:04.790 --> 02:02:04.800 align:start position:0%
specifically calling out transgender
 
02:02:06.229 --> 02:02:06.239 align:start position:0%
youth and transgender people who are
 
02:02:08.510 --> 02:02:08.520 align:start position:0%
incarcerated the law is cruel and it's
 
02:02:10.870 --> 02:02:10.880 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional and has no place here
 
02:02:12.709 --> 02:02:12.719 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire and i'm happy to take
 
02:02:14.310 --> 02:02:14.320 align:start position:0%
questions um there's been a lot of
 
02:02:15.750 --> 02:02:15.760 align:start position:0%
misinformation that i've heard in this
 
02:02:17.750 --> 02:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
room today and i would like to help
 
02:02:19.189 --> 02:02:19.199 align:start position:0%
clarify for anyone who has questions all
 
02:02:20.870 --> 02:02:20.880 align:start position:0%
right thank you attorney herschel
 
02:02:22.550 --> 02:02:22.560 align:start position:0%
questions for the
 
02:02:24.790 --> 02:02:24.800 align:start position:0%
attorney representative pearson
 
02:02:25.910 --> 02:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:02:27.830 --> 02:02:27.840 align:start position:0%
um you
 
02:02:31.589 --> 02:02:31.599 align:start position:0%
just to make sure i heard you correctly
 
02:02:33.990 --> 02:02:34.000 align:start position:0%
you use the term special disability sir
 
02:02:36.070 --> 02:02:36.080 align:start position:0%
do you believe that transgender people
 
02:02:38.310 --> 02:02:38.320 align:start position:0%
are disabled
 
02:02:39.830 --> 02:02:39.840 align:start position:0%
that's not the um thank you for the
 
02:02:41.350 --> 02:02:41.360 align:start position:0%
question that is not the uh when the
 
02:02:42.790 --> 02:02:42.800 align:start position:0%
supreme court used the word a special
 
02:02:44.790 --> 02:02:44.800 align:start position:0%
disability they were not referring to
 
02:02:46.070 --> 02:02:46.080 align:start position:0%
disability in the sense that we
 
02:02:48.390 --> 02:02:48.400 align:start position:0%
understand it today we understand the
 
02:02:49.990 --> 02:02:50.000 align:start position:0%
understanding of the court in the in
 
02:02:51.750 --> 02:02:51.760 align:start position:0%
saying that was that it imposes a
 
02:02:54.149 --> 02:02:54.159 align:start position:0%
disability on a class of people by
 
02:02:55.430 --> 02:02:55.440 align:start position:0%
giving them different treatment under
 
02:02:57.990 --> 02:02:58.000 align:start position:0%
the law that's not the health disability
 
02:02:59.990 --> 02:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
context that we're commonly used to
 
02:03:02.229 --> 02:03:02.239 align:start position:0%
hearing the word
 
02:03:05.030 --> 02:03:05.040 align:start position:0%
does that answer a question
 
02:03:07.109 --> 02:03:07.119 align:start position:0%
it'll stipulate that it does
 
02:03:10.629 --> 02:03:10.639 align:start position:0%
is there any further questions
 
02:03:13.109 --> 02:03:13.119 align:start position:0%
representative cannon
 
02:03:14.390 --> 02:03:14.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
02:03:18.709 --> 02:03:18.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:20.629 --> 02:03:20.639 align:start position:0%
would you believe
 
02:03:22.629 --> 02:03:22.639 align:start position:0%
that with all the legislation and the
 
02:03:25.510 --> 02:03:25.520 align:start position:0%
focusing on transgender people and
 
02:03:27.830 --> 02:03:27.840 align:start position:0%
the challenges we face that there are
 
02:03:30.070 --> 02:03:30.080 align:start position:0%
times when i walk down the street and i
 
02:03:34.070 --> 02:03:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:35.669 --> 02:03:35.679 align:start position:0%
i would believe that because it's true
 
02:03:37.910 --> 02:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
that many many transgender people across
 
02:03:39.109 --> 02:03:39.119 align:start position:0%
the country
 
02:03:41.030 --> 02:03:41.040 align:start position:0%
and across the world in fact
 
02:03:42.470 --> 02:03:42.480 align:start position:0%
including here in new hampshire face a
 
02:03:44.390 --> 02:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
lot of threats of violence against their
 
02:03:48.229 --> 02:03:48.239 align:start position:0%
person and um and to that point
 
02:03:50.310 --> 02:03:50.320 align:start position:0%
arguments that there should be separate
 
02:03:52.870 --> 02:03:52.880 align:start position:0%
facilities for people who claim to be
 
02:03:54.950 --> 02:03:54.960 align:start position:0%
transgender because apparently a lot of
 
02:03:57.109 --> 02:03:57.119 align:start position:0%
people believe that people would pretend
 
02:03:59.189 --> 02:03:59.199 align:start position:0%
to be transgender in order to harm women
 
02:04:00.629 --> 02:04:00.639 align:start position:0%
so the idea that i've heard in this room
 
02:04:02.550 --> 02:04:02.560 align:start position:0%
that they should be put in places with
 
02:04:04.310 --> 02:04:04.320 align:start position:0%
transgender people and isolated from
 
02:04:06.069 --> 02:04:06.079 align:start position:0%
other people so that transgender people
 
02:04:10.629 --> 02:04:10.639 align:start position:0%
are subject to um to to assault is is is
 
02:04:12.470 --> 02:04:12.480 align:start position:0%
an obscene suggestion suggestion in my
 
02:04:12.480 --> 02:04:13.830 align:start position:0%
an obscene suggestion suggestion in my
view

02:04:13.830 --> 02:04:13.840 align:start position:0%
view
 
02:04:15.589 --> 02:04:15.599 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
02:04:18.310 --> 02:04:18.320 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative knuck
 
02:04:20.709 --> 02:04:20.719 align:start position:0%
just a quick question uh the
 
02:04:22.229 --> 02:04:22.239 align:start position:0%
a lot of conversation came around the
 
02:04:23.990 --> 02:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
athletics in itself has been presented
 
02:04:25.750 --> 02:04:25.760 align:start position:0%
again as kind of a binary either male or
 
02:04:28.470 --> 02:04:28.480 align:start position:0%
female but can you clarify because i
 
02:04:30.950 --> 02:04:30.960 align:start position:0%
don't know the answer how many
 
02:04:33.510 --> 02:04:33.520 align:start position:0%
transgender identity transgender females
 
02:04:35.830 --> 02:04:35.840 align:start position:0%
so biologic males identifying females in
 
02:04:37.830 --> 02:04:37.840 align:start position:0%
let's say middle school and high school
 
02:04:39.510 --> 02:04:39.520 align:start position:0%
who are competing are on hormonal
 
02:04:39.520 --> 02:04:40.550 align:start position:0%
who are competing are on hormonal
therapy

02:04:40.550 --> 02:04:40.560 align:start position:0%
therapy
 
02:04:43.350 --> 02:04:43.360 align:start position:0%
testosterone blockers and would that
 
02:04:45.750 --> 02:04:45.760 align:start position:0%
equalize that physical advantage which
 
02:04:48.550 --> 02:04:48.560 align:start position:0%
would otherwise exist if it were a
 
02:04:50.950 --> 02:04:50.960 align:start position:0%
non-treated biological meal thank you
 
02:04:53.350 --> 02:04:53.360 align:start position:0%
for the question there is no evidence to
 
02:04:56.950 --> 02:04:56.960 align:start position:0%
suggest that a pers a transgender girl
 
02:04:58.149 --> 02:04:58.159 align:start position:0%
who has been
 
02:04:59.669 --> 02:04:59.679 align:start position:0%
treated with
 
02:05:01.990 --> 02:05:02.000 align:start position:0%
puberty suppressing hormone therapy at a
 
02:05:03.270 --> 02:05:03.280 align:start position:0%
young age
 
02:05:05.830 --> 02:05:05.840 align:start position:0%
has any any different performance in any
 
02:05:07.830 --> 02:05:07.840 align:start position:0%
athletics there's no evidence to suggest
 
02:05:10.709 --> 02:05:10.719 align:start position:0%
that and that is um that is a an
 
02:05:12.390 --> 02:05:12.400 align:start position:0%
increasingly large percentage of
 
02:05:15.189 --> 02:05:15.199 align:start position:0%
transgender youth in um in
 
02:05:17.189 --> 02:05:17.199 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire schools and so to
 
02:05:19.189 --> 02:05:19.199 align:start position:0%
suggest that they should be excluded
 
02:05:20.550 --> 02:05:20.560 align:start position:0%
from sports because they have some
 
02:05:23.910 --> 02:05:23.920 align:start position:0%
advantage that they don't have is uh is
 
02:05:25.910 --> 02:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
is overbroad and absurd thank you for
 
02:05:26.790 --> 02:05:26.800 align:start position:0%
the question
 
02:05:32.229 --> 02:05:32.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:34.390 --> 02:05:34.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
02:05:35.990 --> 02:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:37.030 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

02:05:37.030 --> 02:05:37.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:38.550 --> 02:05:38.560 align:start position:0%
are you aware that there are actual
 
02:05:41.589 --> 02:05:41.599 align:start position:0%
skeletal differences between biological
 
02:05:43.910 --> 02:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
males and biological females and that a
 
02:05:47.270 --> 02:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
female's hips actually the when you hang
 
02:05:48.550 --> 02:05:48.560 align:start position:0%
a skeleton
 
02:05:48.560 --> 02:05:49.350 align:start position:0%
a skeleton
the

02:05:49.350 --> 02:05:49.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:05:51.270 --> 02:05:51.280 align:start position:0%
the femur
 
02:05:52.709 --> 02:05:52.719 align:start position:0%
angles in
 
02:05:56.470 --> 02:05:56.480 align:start position:0%
and then the the calf the the
 
02:05:59.030 --> 02:05:59.040 align:start position:0%
shin bones angle actually will go
 
02:06:00.950 --> 02:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
straight down from that angle and that
 
02:06:03.270 --> 02:06:03.280 align:start position:0%
the males actually are straighter and
 
02:06:05.589 --> 02:06:05.599 align:start position:0%
that the upper body strength of a male
 
02:06:06.790 --> 02:06:06.800 align:start position:0%
whether they're
 
02:06:08.550 --> 02:06:08.560 align:start position:0%
taking hormonal
 
02:06:10.870 --> 02:06:10.880 align:start position:0%
treatments or not still
 
02:06:14.550 --> 02:06:14.560 align:start position:0%
gives them an advantage over females
 
02:06:16.950 --> 02:06:16.960 align:start position:0%
biological females thank you for the res
 
02:06:19.589 --> 02:06:19.599 align:start position:0%
um for the question respectfully um your
 
02:06:21.189 --> 02:06:21.199 align:start position:0%
suggestion that there's a categorical
 
02:06:22.709 --> 02:06:22.719 align:start position:0%
difference between the skeletons of
 
02:06:24.950 --> 02:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
people born male and people born female
 
02:06:26.870 --> 02:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
is false there's not a categorical
 
02:06:28.550 --> 02:06:28.560 align:start position:0%
distinction between skeletons
 
02:06:31.030 --> 02:06:31.040 align:start position:0%
furthermore the the
 
02:06:33.830 --> 02:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
the concept that people who have taken
 
02:06:36.069 --> 02:06:36.079 align:start position:0%
puberty suppressing hormone therapy from
 
02:06:38.149 --> 02:06:38.159 align:start position:0%
the time they were a young person before
 
02:06:40.069 --> 02:06:40.079 align:start position:0%
um before going through puberty that
 
02:06:41.830 --> 02:06:41.840 align:start position:0%
they would have any difference from a
 
02:06:43.669 --> 02:06:43.679 align:start position:0%
person of the same gender
 
02:06:45.510 --> 02:06:45.520 align:start position:0%
and their skeleton system is not rooted
 
02:06:47.030 --> 02:06:47.040 align:start position:0%
in science or evidence there's no
 
02:06:49.510 --> 02:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
evidence to support what you just said
 
02:06:51.510 --> 02:06:51.520 align:start position:0%
for those people and
 
02:06:51.520 --> 02:06:53.589 align:start position:0%
for those people and
moreover

02:06:53.589 --> 02:06:53.599 align:start position:0%
moreover
 
02:06:56.390 --> 02:06:56.400 align:start position:0%
information about a particular person's
 
02:06:58.550 --> 02:06:58.560 align:start position:0%
what i can speak to is the fact that
 
02:07:00.310 --> 02:07:00.320 align:start position:0%
hormonal like
 
02:07:02.390 --> 02:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
natal males and natal females have
 
02:07:04.550 --> 02:07:04.560 align:start position:0%
categorically different hormonal body
 
02:07:05.990 --> 02:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
like their bodies produce different
 
02:07:07.750 --> 02:07:07.760 align:start position:0%
levels of hormones of different types of
 
02:07:10.390 --> 02:07:10.400 align:start position:0%
hormones that is categorically true and
 
02:07:12.229 --> 02:07:12.239 align:start position:0%
so to the point to the extent that that
 
02:07:14.550 --> 02:07:14.560 align:start position:0%
was your point um then you're absolutely
 
02:07:17.750 --> 02:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
correct um otherwise otherwise i don't
 
02:07:17.760 --> 02:07:19.270 align:start position:0%
correct um otherwise otherwise i don't
um

02:07:19.270 --> 02:07:19.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:20.870 --> 02:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
i would need to see evidence to support
 
02:07:24.629 --> 02:07:24.639 align:start position:0%
your other claims one follow-up delemus
 
02:07:26.390 --> 02:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
02:07:28.069 --> 02:07:28.079 align:start position:0%
would you believe that i was a a
 
02:07:30.870 --> 02:07:30.880 align:start position:0%
psychology major and a bio minor biolog
 
02:07:33.669 --> 02:07:33.679 align:start position:0%
biology minor in college and that there
 
02:07:33.679 --> 02:07:35.750 align:start position:0%
biology minor in college and that there
is

02:07:35.750 --> 02:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:07:35.760 --> 02:07:36.790 align:start position:0%
is
very

02:07:36.790 --> 02:07:36.800 align:start position:0%
very
 
02:07:39.589 --> 02:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
clear evidence of the differences
 
02:07:39.599 --> 02:07:40.390 align:start position:0%
clear evidence of the differences
between

02:07:40.390 --> 02:07:40.400 align:start position:0%
between
 
02:07:43.430 --> 02:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
male and female skeletons
 
02:07:44.629 --> 02:07:44.639 align:start position:0%
um i
 
02:07:46.390 --> 02:07:46.400 align:start position:0%
would believe your credentials as you
 
02:07:48.709 --> 02:07:48.719 align:start position:0%
described them but i would disagree that
 
02:07:50.390 --> 02:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
there is any evidence that a person who
 
02:07:51.350 --> 02:07:51.360 align:start position:0%
has been
 
02:07:53.109 --> 02:07:53.119 align:start position:0%
on puberty suppressing hormone therapy
 
02:07:54.709 --> 02:07:54.719 align:start position:0%
from the from a young age has a
 
02:07:56.709 --> 02:07:56.719 align:start position:0%
different skeleton from somebody of the
 
02:07:58.790 --> 02:07:58.800 align:start position:0%
same gender
 
02:08:01.189 --> 02:08:01.199 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much
 
02:08:04.310 --> 02:08:04.320 align:start position:0%
representative chair pearson
 
02:08:06.069 --> 02:08:06.079 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
02:08:09.109 --> 02:08:09.119 align:start position:0%
do you think that males and females and
 
02:08:11.109 --> 02:08:11.119 align:start position:0%
i'm talking biological groups here not
 
02:08:13.350 --> 02:08:13.360 align:start position:0%
social constructs
 
02:08:15.910 --> 02:08:15.920 align:start position:0%
that males and females are real
 
02:08:19.189 --> 02:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
categories of people that exist
 
02:08:21.030 --> 02:08:21.040 align:start position:0%
and therefore the state sometimes is
 
02:08:23.510 --> 02:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
justified in seeing this difference
 
02:08:25.990 --> 02:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
between categories
 
02:08:27.350 --> 02:08:27.360 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question to the
 
02:08:28.550 --> 02:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
extent that the first part of your
 
02:08:29.990 --> 02:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
question was an existential question and
 
02:08:31.750 --> 02:08:31.760 align:start position:0%
i do not have an answer for it to the
 
02:08:33.990 --> 02:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
extent that the quote the state has an
 
02:08:35.830 --> 02:08:35.840 align:start position:0%
interest in recognizing that different
 
02:08:37.750 --> 02:08:37.760 align:start position:0%
people of different genders
 
02:08:39.430 --> 02:08:39.440 align:start position:0%
have different
 
02:08:43.270 --> 02:08:43.280 align:start position:0%
different cultural social and physical
 
02:08:45.189 --> 02:08:45.199 align:start position:0%
physical roles i agree
 
02:08:46.870 --> 02:08:46.880 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
02:08:49.270 --> 02:08:49.280 align:start position:0%
you're saying you can't answer the
 
02:08:52.310 --> 02:08:52.320 align:start position:0%
question that males and females
 
02:08:55.030 --> 02:08:55.040 align:start position:0%
are separate biological groups without
 
02:08:57.430 --> 02:08:57.440 align:start position:0%
claiming that is merely existential is
 
02:08:59.430 --> 02:08:59.440 align:start position:0%
that your statement um respectively that
 
02:09:02.629 --> 02:09:02.639 align:start position:0%
wasn't your question but um but
 
02:09:03.990 --> 02:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
can you restate your question then so i
 
02:09:07.910 --> 02:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:11.750 --> 02:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
do you think that males and females
 
02:09:13.750 --> 02:09:13.760 align:start position:0%
as biological groups
 
02:09:16.550 --> 02:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
are real separate categories of people
 
02:09:19.270 --> 02:09:19.280 align:start position:0%
what do you mean by real
 
02:09:21.510 --> 02:09:21.520 align:start position:0%
okay the question is the question sounds
 
02:09:23.189 --> 02:09:23.199 align:start position:0%
strange to me i'm having trouble
 
02:09:24.470 --> 02:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
understanding i'll accept that as your
 
02:09:24.480 --> 02:09:26.550 align:start position:0%
understanding i'll accept that as your
answer

02:09:26.550 --> 02:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
answer
 
02:09:28.229 --> 02:09:28.239 align:start position:0%
thank you we'll do
 
02:09:30.390 --> 02:09:30.400 align:start position:0%
uh representative pearson
 
02:09:32.870 --> 02:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
02:09:34.709 --> 02:09:34.719 align:start position:0%
um i'm a
 
02:09:36.709 --> 02:09:36.719 align:start position:0%
bit of a history
 
02:09:38.390 --> 02:09:38.400 align:start position:0%
not i'm actually a published historical
 
02:09:41.830 --> 02:09:41.840 align:start position:0%
author and i've i've
 
02:09:43.910 --> 02:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
had the fortune of attending some or
 
02:09:45.589 --> 02:09:45.599 align:start position:0%
being in the presence of some very
 
02:09:47.589 --> 02:09:47.599 align:start position:0%
amazing archaeological finds through
 
02:09:50.310 --> 02:09:50.320 align:start position:0%
museums of throughout the world
 
02:09:51.830 --> 02:09:51.840 align:start position:0%
especially recently in the british
 
02:09:51.840 --> 02:09:54.470 align:start position:0%
especially recently in the british
museum

02:09:54.470 --> 02:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:57.830 --> 02:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:00.149 --> 02:10:00.159 align:start position:0%
archaeological digs occur are these
 
02:10:01.990 --> 02:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
archaeologists incorrect when they
 
02:10:04.870 --> 02:10:04.880 align:start position:0%
identify the bones they find as male or
 
02:10:06.709 --> 02:10:06.719 align:start position:0%
female based on the characteristics of
 
02:10:10.790 --> 02:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:12.229 --> 02:10:12.239 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question i assume
 
02:10:14.069 --> 02:10:14.079 align:start position:0%
you're referring back to rep delemus's
 
02:10:14.079 --> 02:10:15.109 align:start position:0%
you're referring back to rep delemus's
question

02:10:15.109 --> 02:10:15.119 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:10:16.870 --> 02:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
in which case i think i can clarify what
 
02:10:18.870 --> 02:10:18.880 align:start position:0%
i was answering to make
 
02:10:18.880 --> 02:10:19.990 align:start position:0%
i was answering to make
to

02:10:19.990 --> 02:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:10:21.669 --> 02:10:21.679 align:start position:0%
help you help you understand what what
 
02:10:23.430 --> 02:10:23.440 align:start position:0%
the point is that i was making when i
 
02:10:25.189 --> 02:10:25.199 align:start position:0%
said that there is not a categorical
 
02:10:27.430 --> 02:10:27.440 align:start position:0%
distinction between any skeletal
 
02:10:29.430 --> 02:10:29.440 align:start position:0%
elements of males and females what i
 
02:10:31.669 --> 02:10:31.679 align:start position:0%
mean to say is that there are people who
 
02:10:34.229 --> 02:10:34.239 align:start position:0%
are born male who have skeletal who have
 
02:10:35.910 --> 02:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
a range of skeletal
 
02:10:37.669 --> 02:10:37.679 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:10:39.430 --> 02:10:39.440 align:start position:0%
possible skeletons and there are a range
 
02:10:41.510 --> 02:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
of people born female
 
02:10:43.589 --> 02:10:43.599 align:start position:0%
possible skeletons and there is overlap
 
02:10:45.030 --> 02:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
between each element of a person's
 
02:10:47.510 --> 02:10:47.520 align:start position:0%
skeleton there is overlap between
 
02:10:49.430 --> 02:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
potential male skeletons and female
 
02:10:51.510 --> 02:10:51.520 align:start position:0%
skeletons so no i don't believe that
 
02:10:54.149 --> 02:10:54.159 align:start position:0%
historic historical uh
 
02:10:56.950 --> 02:10:56.960 align:start position:0%
architecture sorry not architecture but
 
02:10:56.960 --> 02:10:57.830 align:start position:0%
architecture sorry not architecture but
uh

02:10:57.830 --> 02:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:10:59.990 --> 02:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
archaeologists i do not think that they
 
02:11:01.990 --> 02:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
are incorrect to make distinctions
 
02:11:03.669 --> 02:11:03.679 align:start position:0%
between bodies based on the evidence
 
02:11:05.750 --> 02:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
that they have i just i'm making the
 
02:11:07.189 --> 02:11:07.199 align:start position:0%
point that the distinction is not
 
02:11:09.430 --> 02:11:09.440 align:start position:0%
categorical and that not every single
 
02:11:11.270 --> 02:11:11.280 align:start position:0%
male skeleton is identical and not every
 
02:11:14.550 --> 02:11:14.560 align:start position:0%
single female skeleton is identical
 
02:11:20.310 --> 02:11:20.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:23.430 --> 02:11:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:26.149 --> 02:11:26.159 align:start position:0%
as as one who grew up with exactly the
 
02:11:28.470 --> 02:11:28.480 align:start position:0%
same sized hands as her older brother i
 
02:11:30.229 --> 02:11:30.239 align:start position:0%
appreciate that answer
 
02:11:30.239 --> 02:11:32.390 align:start position:0%
appreciate that answer
uh

02:11:32.390 --> 02:11:32.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:11:35.910 --> 02:11:35.920 align:start position:0%
would you agree with me that there are
 
02:11:39.430 --> 02:11:39.440 align:start position:0%
individuals born in this and every other
 
02:11:39.440 --> 02:11:41.350 align:start position:0%
individuals born in this and every other
century

02:11:41.350 --> 02:11:41.360 align:start position:0%
century
 
02:11:44.470 --> 02:11:44.480 align:start position:0%
who are not
 
02:11:48.629 --> 02:11:48.639 align:start position:0%
entirely male nor entirely female who
 
02:11:48.639 --> 02:11:49.750 align:start position:0%
entirely male nor entirely female who
have

02:11:49.750 --> 02:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:11:53.270 --> 02:11:53.280 align:start position:0%
characteristic some characteristics of
 
02:11:55.669 --> 02:11:55.679 align:start position:0%
each gender
 
02:11:58.470 --> 02:11:58.480 align:start position:0%
and that sometimes children are born who
 
02:12:01.830 --> 02:12:01.840 align:start position:0%
appear biologically female
 
02:12:01.840 --> 02:12:03.109 align:start position:0%
appear biologically female
and

02:12:03.109 --> 02:12:03.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:12:05.669 --> 02:12:05.679 align:start position:0%
from an external point of view are not
 
02:12:09.030 --> 02:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
identified as chromosomally male until
 
02:12:11.189 --> 02:12:11.199 align:start position:0%
they hit puberty
 
02:12:15.270 --> 02:12:15.280 align:start position:0%
and so would you not agree with me
 
02:12:20.149 --> 02:12:20.159 align:start position:0%
that the determination of biological sex
 
02:12:23.910 --> 02:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
while clear in many individuals
 
02:12:29.830 --> 02:12:29.840 align:start position:0%
is not as binary as we have been
 
02:12:32.709 --> 02:12:32.719 align:start position:0%
accustomed to thinking of it as
 
02:12:34.310 --> 02:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for the question and i
 
02:12:35.669 --> 02:12:35.679 align:start position:0%
believe that your question actually
 
02:12:37.350 --> 02:12:37.360 align:start position:0%
underscores a lot of the points that i
 
02:12:39.270 --> 02:12:39.280 align:start position:0%
was uh you know trying to articulate
 
02:12:41.430 --> 02:12:41.440 align:start position:0%
here and you articulated it much better
 
02:12:43.270 --> 02:12:43.280 align:start position:0%
which is to say that
 
02:12:46.149 --> 02:12:46.159 align:start position:0%
biological sex has is not and has never
 
02:12:49.430 --> 02:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
been a strict binary although the number
 
02:12:50.870 --> 02:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
of people born with intersex
 
02:12:52.709 --> 02:12:52.719 align:start position:0%
characteristics that you were describing
 
02:12:54.470 --> 02:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
is a very small percentage of people
 
02:12:56.870 --> 02:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
those people do in fact exist and have
 
02:12:59.350 --> 02:12:59.360 align:start position:0%
always existed and have always suffered
 
02:12:59.360 --> 02:13:00.390 align:start position:0%
always existed and have always suffered
from

02:13:00.390 --> 02:13:00.400 align:start position:0%
from
 
02:13:04.390 --> 02:13:04.400 align:start position:0%
exclusion and stigmatization and um and
 
02:13:06.709 --> 02:13:06.719 align:start position:0%
and other and other um maladies because
 
02:13:09.669 --> 02:13:09.679 align:start position:0%
of their status being born on intersex
 
02:13:11.750 --> 02:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
02:13:14.950 --> 02:13:14.960 align:start position:0%
a follow-up representative weber
 
02:13:17.589 --> 02:13:17.599 align:start position:0%
so is it possible that there are people
 
02:13:20.149 --> 02:13:20.159 align:start position:0%
who are identified at birth
 
02:13:22.709 --> 02:13:22.719 align:start position:0%
as being of one sex and that sex is
 
02:13:25.270 --> 02:13:25.280 align:start position:0%
recorded on their birth certificate
 
02:13:27.430 --> 02:13:27.440 align:start position:0%
and it is later determined that that was
 
02:13:27.440 --> 02:13:31.350 align:start position:0%
and it is later determined that that was
incorrect

02:13:31.350 --> 02:13:31.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:33.750 --> 02:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
i would agree that it that it that
 
02:13:35.669 --> 02:13:35.679 align:start position:0%
people can be classified a certain way
 
02:13:37.270 --> 02:13:37.280 align:start position:0%
on their birth certificate and that
 
02:13:38.790 --> 02:13:38.800 align:start position:0%
their birth certificate would then
 
02:13:40.550 --> 02:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
reflect something that isn't consistent
 
02:13:42.229 --> 02:13:42.239 align:start position:0%
with their intersex characteristics for
 
02:13:43.350 --> 02:13:43.360 align:start position:0%
those people who are born that way
 
02:13:47.189 --> 02:13:47.199 align:start position:0%
that's absolutely true and there are um
 
02:13:50.229 --> 02:13:50.239 align:start position:0%
numerous examples right now in the field
 
02:13:53.990 --> 02:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
of olympic athletics right of people of
 
02:13:56.229 --> 02:13:56.239 align:start position:0%
women who are born women identified as
 
02:13:57.910 --> 02:13:57.920 align:start position:0%
women their entire lives but because
 
02:14:00.390 --> 02:14:00.400 align:start position:0%
they were born with differences in um
 
02:14:02.709 --> 02:14:02.719 align:start position:0%
sexual development that they that they
 
02:14:04.470 --> 02:14:04.480 align:start position:0%
are are being singled out as being
 
02:14:06.870 --> 02:14:06.880 align:start position:0%
ineligible to participate in sports um
 
02:14:08.629 --> 02:14:08.639 align:start position:0%
so so yes you're absolutely right that
 
02:14:09.589 --> 02:14:09.599 align:start position:0%
this has
 
02:14:11.750 --> 02:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
always been um an
 
02:14:15.750 --> 02:14:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:17.669 --> 02:14:17.679 align:start position:0%
okay no nothing further thank you
 
02:14:17.679 --> 02:14:20.069 align:start position:0%
okay no nothing further thank you

give last week that i would give written
 
02:14:25.589 --> 02:14:25.599 align:start position:0%
testimony on a different bill and i'm
 
02:14:33.030 --> 02:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:33.040 --> 02:14:35.270 align:start position:0%
 
you

02:14:35.270 --> 02:14:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:39.830 --> 02:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:44.709 --> 02:14:44.719 align:start position:0%
for the members it's uh house bill 1077
 
02:14:46.390 --> 02:14:46.400 align:start position:0%
just for the record to make sure
 
02:14:48.069 --> 02:14:48.079 align:start position:0%

02:14:49.430 --> 02:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
okay thank you so much for your time

recognize uh hope i pronounced the name
 
02:14:58.629 --> 02:14:58.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:00.310 --> 02:15:00.320 align:start position:0%
he's representing himself and he's in
 
02:15:04.390 --> 02:15:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:06.550 --> 02:15:06.560 align:start position:0%
you have three minutes sir
 
02:15:08.069 --> 02:15:08.079 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and committee for
 
02:15:09.990 --> 02:15:10.000 align:start position:0%
allowing me to testify
 
02:15:11.430 --> 02:15:11.440 align:start position:0%
um i'm going to come at this from a
 
02:15:14.069 --> 02:15:14.079 align:start position:0%
slightly different point of view
 
02:15:16.390 --> 02:15:16.400 align:start position:0%
right this uh house bill 1088 is
 
02:15:19.109 --> 02:15:19.119 align:start position:0%
attempting to amend rsa5-c
 
02:15:20.550 --> 02:15:20.560 align:start position:0%
colon 87
 
02:15:23.430 --> 02:15:23.440 align:start position:0%
and rsa 260 which are two two existing
 
02:15:25.189 --> 02:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
laws that we have
 
02:15:28.149 --> 02:15:28.159 align:start position:0%
um we have to have specificity in our
 
02:15:30.550 --> 02:15:30.560 align:start position:0%
laws or they become meaningless and
 
02:15:32.709 --> 02:15:32.719 align:start position:0%
unenforceable we can't have a law that
 
02:15:35.030 --> 02:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
continually allows the goal post to be
 
02:15:38.229 --> 02:15:38.239 align:start position:0%
moved based on the latest ideology
 
02:15:40.149 --> 02:15:40.159 align:start position:0%
this is what we have been doing on these
 
02:15:42.149 --> 02:15:42.159 align:start position:0%
two laws by categorizing people by
 
02:15:44.950 --> 02:15:44.960 align:start position:0%
gender rather than biological sex
 
02:15:47.109 --> 02:15:47.119 align:start position:0%
biological sex as you all know refers to
 
02:15:48.950 --> 02:15:48.960 align:start position:0%
a person's physical characteristics at
 
02:15:51.830 --> 02:15:51.840 align:start position:0%
birth and their genetic makeup one x and
 
02:15:53.510 --> 02:15:53.520 align:start position:0%
y for male
 
02:15:55.830 --> 02:15:55.840 align:start position:0%
two x chromosomes for female with few
 
02:15:58.229 --> 02:15:58.239 align:start position:0%
exceptions this is unambiguous the few
 
02:15:59.669 --> 02:15:59.679 align:start position:0%
exceptions i'm talking about are the
 
02:16:01.189 --> 02:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
things that have been discussed relative
 
02:16:02.550 --> 02:16:02.560 align:start position:0%
to intersex
 
02:16:04.790 --> 02:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
uh issues here today according to the
 
02:16:07.750 --> 02:16:07.760 align:start position:0%
national library of medicine point zero
 
02:16:10.550 --> 02:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
one eight percent of the births have
 
02:16:12.550 --> 02:16:12.560 align:start position:0%
intersex characteristics
 
02:16:16.069 --> 02:16:16.079 align:start position:0%
okay that's that's documented um
 
02:16:19.750 --> 02:16:19.760 align:start position:0%
so gender identity and biological sex
 
02:16:21.910 --> 02:16:21.920 align:start position:0%
are different they are not equal
 
02:16:24.470 --> 02:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
right so biological sex is objective and
 
02:16:24.480 --> 02:16:25.830 align:start position:0%
right so biological sex is objective and
specific

02:16:25.830 --> 02:16:25.840 align:start position:0%
specific
 
02:16:29.030 --> 02:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
gender is subjective and fluid we have
 
02:16:31.109 --> 02:16:31.119 align:start position:0%
to be specific in our definitions
 
02:16:32.950 --> 02:16:32.960 align:start position:0%
relative to our existing legislation
 
02:16:34.709 --> 02:16:34.719 align:start position:0%
that's in place as law and that's what
 
02:16:37.349 --> 02:16:37.359 align:start position:0%
hb 1180 is attempting to do it's not
 
02:16:39.110 --> 02:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
about bullying anyone as some have
 
02:16:41.270 --> 02:16:41.280 align:start position:0%
stated i've heard that several times
 
02:16:43.270 --> 02:16:43.280 align:start position:0%
it's about seeking rationality and
 
02:16:45.910 --> 02:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
reasonableness in identifying a person's
 
02:16:48.549 --> 02:16:48.559 align:start position:0%
true biological sex aside from what they
 
02:16:52.150 --> 02:16:52.160 align:start position:0%
may choose regarding gender
 
02:16:54.070 --> 02:16:54.080 align:start position:0%
it's about seeking fairness safety and
 
02:16:55.669 --> 02:16:55.679 align:start position:0%
emotional well-being
 
02:16:58.790 --> 02:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
for our citizens in all scenarios
 
02:17:00.709 --> 02:17:00.719 align:start position:0%
it's your duty as legislators to make
 
02:17:02.150 --> 02:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
that happen
 
02:17:04.150 --> 02:17:04.160 align:start position:0%
and i urge you to support
 
02:17:07.190 --> 02:17:07.200 align:start position:0%
1088 as an otp
 
02:17:08.870 --> 02:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman thank you sir have

02:18:14.389 --> 02:18:14.399 align:start position:0%
state to introduce an anti-trans bill in
 
02:18:18.230 --> 02:18:18.240 align:start position:0%
2022 joining arizona alabama indiana
 
02:18:21.110 --> 02:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
kentucky oklahoma and south dakota our
 
02:18:22.870 --> 02:18:22.880 align:start position:0%
state and country at large needs to move
 
02:18:25.349 --> 02:18:25.359 align:start position:0%
past the stigmatization of these groups
 
02:18:27.270 --> 02:18:27.280 align:start position:0%
ones that have faced far too great
 
02:18:30.150 --> 02:18:30.160 align:start position:0%
oppression throughout our history
 
02:18:31.910 --> 02:18:31.920 align:start position:0%
according to the mayo clinic and as you
 
02:18:33.030 --> 02:18:33.040 align:start position:0%
may know
 
02:18:35.190 --> 02:18:35.200 align:start position:0%
some but not all transgender and gender
 
02:18:37.110 --> 02:18:37.120 align:start position:0%
non-conforming people might experience
 
02:18:39.030 --> 02:18:39.040 align:start position:0%
gender dysphoria at some point in their
 
02:18:39.040 --> 02:18:39.990 align:start position:0%
gender dysphoria at some point in their
lives

02:18:39.990 --> 02:18:40.000 align:start position:0%
lives
 
02:18:41.990 --> 02:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
gender dysphoria is a diagnosis
 
02:18:44.790 --> 02:18:44.800 align:start position:0%
diagnosis listed in the dsm 5 a manual
 
02:18:46.629 --> 02:18:46.639 align:start position:0%
published by the american psychiatric
 
02:18:48.389 --> 02:18:48.399 align:start position:0%
association to diagnose mental
 
02:18:51.270 --> 02:18:51.280 align:start position:0%
conditions this term is intended to be
 
02:18:53.589 --> 02:18:53.599 align:start position:0%
more descriptive than
 
02:18:55.589 --> 02:18:55.599 align:start position:0%
the one that was previously used which
 
02:18:55.599 --> 02:18:56.389 align:start position:0%
the one that was previously used which
was

02:18:56.389 --> 02:18:56.399 align:start position:0%
was
 
02:18:58.790 --> 02:18:58.800 align:start position:0%
gender identity disorder
 
02:19:01.110 --> 02:19:01.120 align:start position:0%
the term gender dysphoria focuses on
 
02:19:03.190 --> 02:19:03.200 align:start position:0%
one's discomfort as the problem rather
 
02:19:05.030 --> 02:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
than identity
 
02:19:07.190 --> 02:19:07.200 align:start position:0%
a diagnosis for gender dysphoria was
 
02:19:09.270 --> 02:19:09.280 align:start position:0%
created to help people get access to
 
02:19:11.110 --> 02:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
necessary health care and effective
 
02:19:13.190 --> 02:19:13.200 align:start position:0%
treatment and so when i hear people
 
02:19:15.669 --> 02:19:15.679 align:start position:0%
earlier testifying to
 
02:19:15.679 --> 02:19:17.030 align:start position:0%
earlier testifying to
um

02:19:17.030 --> 02:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:17.040 --> 02:19:18.150 align:start position:0%
um
their

02:19:18.150 --> 02:19:18.160 align:start position:0%
their
 
02:19:20.150 --> 02:19:20.160 align:start position:0%
issues that they faced in sports or
 
02:19:22.309 --> 02:19:22.319 align:start position:0%
their perceived issues as a competitive
 
02:19:24.709 --> 02:19:24.719 align:start position:0%
swimmer um throughout my entire life i
 
02:19:26.709 --> 02:19:26.719 align:start position:0%
never once felt threatened by
 
02:19:29.910 --> 02:19:29.920 align:start position:0%
a trans athlete competing against me
 
02:19:31.509 --> 02:19:31.519 align:start position:0%
um and i think that a lot of the
 
02:19:35.190 --> 02:19:35.200 align:start position:0%
testimony here today actually undermines
 
02:19:37.190 --> 02:19:37.200 align:start position:0%
the mental struggles that that community
 
02:19:37.200 --> 02:19:38.469 align:start position:0%
the mental struggles that that community
faces

02:19:38.469 --> 02:19:38.479 align:start position:0%
faces
 
02:19:38.479 --> 02:19:40.629 align:start position:0%
faces
um

02:19:40.629 --> 02:19:40.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:42.469 --> 02:19:42.479 align:start position:0%
the trans community and non-binary
 
02:19:45.030 --> 02:19:45.040 align:start position:0%
people deserve respect in all settings
 
02:19:46.950 --> 02:19:46.960 align:start position:0%
especially public ones free from the
 
02:19:49.190 --> 02:19:49.200 align:start position:0%
fear that a public entity will create
 
02:19:51.830 --> 02:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
inequalities discrimination and mental
 
02:19:53.270 --> 02:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
health barriers based on their
 
02:19:55.270 --> 02:19:55.280 align:start position:0%
respective identities
 
02:19:56.870 --> 02:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
according to glsen
 
02:19:58.710 --> 02:19:58.720 align:start position:0%
one sixty percent of transgender
 
02:20:00.469 --> 02:20:00.479 align:start position:0%
students report having been prohibited
 
02:20:02.550 --> 02:20:02.560 align:start position:0%
from using the bathroom or locker room
 
02:20:05.349 --> 02:20:05.359 align:start position:0%
that aligns with their gender identity
 
02:20:08.070 --> 02:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
76 percent of transgender students felt
 
02:20:10.230 --> 02:20:10.240 align:start position:0%
unsafe at school because of their gender
 
02:20:12.389 --> 02:20:12.399 align:start position:0%
and transgender people are at a very
 
02:20:14.469 --> 02:20:14.479 align:start position:0%
high risk of experiencing violence
 
02:20:15.990 --> 02:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
throughout their lives starting even
 
02:20:17.590 --> 02:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
before adolescence
 
02:20:19.750 --> 02:20:19.760 align:start position:0%
two these bills hurt students academic
 
02:20:22.469 --> 02:20:22.479 align:start position:0%
achievement including lower gpas so i
 
02:20:24.550 --> 02:20:24.560 align:start position:0%
want to re-emphasize the importance of
 
02:20:27.429 --> 02:20:27.439 align:start position:0%
the stigmatization that a continued
 
02:20:29.830 --> 02:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
conversation in committee and outside of
 
02:20:32.389 --> 02:20:32.399 align:start position:0%
it continues for our um
 
02:20:33.910 --> 02:20:33.920 align:start position:0%
for our community
 
02:20:36.070 --> 02:20:36.080 align:start position:0%
three such bills would create a public
 
02:20:38.230 --> 02:20:38.240 align:start position:0%
health crisis research shows that as a
 
02:20:40.309 --> 02:20:40.319 align:start position:0%
result of hostile school climate
 
02:20:41.830 --> 02:20:41.840 align:start position:0%
transgender students are more likely to
 
02:20:44.469 --> 02:20:44.479 align:start position:0%
abuse drugs than the general population
 
02:20:46.309 --> 02:20:46.319 align:start position:0%
and so i will conclude
 
02:20:49.030 --> 02:20:49.040 align:start position:0%
my statements now to honor the time and
 
02:20:50.550 --> 02:20:50.560 align:start position:0%
i will answer any questions in my
 
02:20:53.190 --> 02:20:53.200 align:start position:0%
individual capacity unaffiliated from
 
02:20:55.110 --> 02:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
unh law all right thank you sir other
 
02:20:55.120 --> 02:20:57.190 align:start position:0%
unh law all right thank you sir other
questions

02:20:57.190 --> 02:20:57.200 align:start position:0%

02:21:37.510 --> 02:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
i'm a multi-sport female athlete in
 
02:21:39.590 --> 02:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
support of house bill
 
02:21:39.600 --> 02:21:41.110 align:start position:0%

1180
 
02:21:43.429 --> 02:21:43.439 align:start position:0%
i have done ski racing since age 6 and
 
02:21:45.349 --> 02:21:45.359 align:start position:0%
rowing since age 12 and i will continue
 
02:21:47.270 --> 02:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
to row at the college level as a
 
02:21:49.270 --> 02:21:49.280 align:start position:0%
recruited athlete
 
02:21:51.030 --> 02:21:51.040 align:start position:0%
throughout my years in ski racing i have
 
02:21:52.550 --> 02:21:52.560 align:start position:0%
been training amongst both boys and
 
02:21:54.870 --> 02:21:54.880 align:start position:0%
girls but our races are always divided
 
02:21:54.880 --> 02:21:56.150 align:start position:0%
girls but our races are always divided
separately

02:21:56.150 --> 02:21:56.160 align:start position:0%
separately
 
02:21:58.070 --> 02:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
at practice my coaches would always send
 
02:21:59.590 --> 02:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
me down the course right after my friend
 
02:22:01.910 --> 02:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
brady they would tell me to catch him i
 
02:22:03.910 --> 02:22:03.920 align:start position:0%
never could and i still can't no matter
 
02:22:06.389 --> 02:22:06.399 align:start position:0%
how hard i try he always beats me
 
02:22:08.309 --> 02:22:08.319 align:start position:0%
whenever a guy beats a girl's mile time
 
02:22:10.230 --> 02:22:10.240 align:start position:0%
or 100 meter freestyle no one thinks
 
02:22:11.349 --> 02:22:11.359 align:start position:0%
much of it
 
02:22:13.750 --> 02:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
it's expected but whenever a girl beats
 
02:22:16.070 --> 02:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
a guy's mile time or 100 meter freestyle
 
02:22:17.429 --> 02:22:17.439 align:start position:0%
it's a big deal
 
02:22:18.950 --> 02:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
i can't believe you just beat a boy
 
02:22:21.030 --> 02:22:21.040 align:start position:0%
that's crazy or i can't believe you just
 
02:22:22.790 --> 02:22:22.800 align:start position:0%
let a girl beat you
 
02:22:24.550 --> 02:22:24.560 align:start position:0%
boys have a larger skill to amass in
 
02:22:25.910 --> 02:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
girls they have wider shoulders and
 
02:22:28.950 --> 02:22:28.960 align:start position:0%
longer limbs and a lot more testosterone
 
02:22:31.030 --> 02:22:31.040 align:start position:0%
so i expect my friend brady to beat me i
 
02:22:32.710 --> 02:22:32.720 align:start position:0%
try my hardest but i know i probably
 
02:22:35.190 --> 02:22:35.200 align:start position:0%
won't beat him but that's okay because i
 
02:22:36.870 --> 02:22:36.880 align:start position:0%
don't compete against him only in
 
02:22:36.880 --> 02:22:37.990 align:start position:0%
don't compete against him only in
practice

02:22:37.990 --> 02:22:38.000 align:start position:0%
practice
 
02:22:39.910 --> 02:22:39.920 align:start position:0%
but if i did compete against him i'd be
 
02:22:42.230 --> 02:22:42.240 align:start position:0%
discouraged it wouldn't be fair he's
 
02:22:44.070 --> 02:22:44.080 align:start position:0%
almost a foot taller than me he has at
 
02:22:46.469 --> 02:22:46.479 align:start position:0%
least 50 pounds on me he has more muscle
 
02:22:47.750 --> 02:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
mass than me and he's got a lot more
 
02:22:49.670 --> 02:22:49.680 align:start position:0%
testosterone than me
 
02:22:51.349 --> 02:22:51.359 align:start position:0%
sports present an opportunity to have
 
02:22:53.510 --> 02:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
fun show off your talents and improve
 
02:22:55.429 --> 02:22:55.439 align:start position:0%
always aiming to be the best
 
02:22:56.950 --> 02:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
but i won't have fun if i'm competing
 
02:22:58.710 --> 02:22:58.720 align:start position:0%
against someone biologically different
 
02:23:00.230 --> 02:23:00.240 align:start position:0%
from me
 
02:23:02.550 --> 02:23:02.560 align:start position:0%
like my friend brady i can't show off my
 
02:23:04.469 --> 02:23:04.479 align:start position:0%
talents as he will always beat me and i
 
02:23:06.070 --> 02:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
may improve but i stand no chance
 
02:23:07.990 --> 02:23:08.000 align:start position:0%
against him so i will have to aim for
 
02:23:09.510 --> 02:23:09.520 align:start position:0%
second best
 
02:23:11.190 --> 02:23:11.200 align:start position:0%
i am genetically different from brady
 
02:23:12.710 --> 02:23:12.720 align:start position:0%
down to the weight and strength of my
 
02:23:14.469 --> 02:23:14.479 align:start position:0%
bones and that is something no one can
 
02:23:14.479 --> 02:23:15.830 align:start position:0%
bones and that is something no one can
change

02:23:15.830 --> 02:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
change
 
02:23:17.270 --> 02:23:17.280 align:start position:0%
don't let the female athletes of the
 
02:23:19.429 --> 02:23:19.439 align:start position:0%
next generations be discouraged
 
02:23:21.270 --> 02:23:21.280 align:start position:0%
please consider voting to keep athletes
 
02:23:23.190 --> 02:23:23.200 align:start position:0%
competing against those with whom they
 
02:23:25.190 --> 02:23:25.200 align:start position:0%
are biologically similar thank you for
 
02:23:27.750 --> 02:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
listening thank you miss goldstein uh
 
02:23:29.030 --> 02:23:29.040 align:start position:0%
questions for
 
02:23:31.349 --> 02:23:31.359 align:start position:0%
miss goldstein
 
02:23:32.790 --> 02:23:32.800 align:start position:0%
not being hurt oh excuse me
 
02:23:38.309 --> 02:23:38.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:40.070 --> 02:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
02:23:42.230 --> 02:23:42.240 align:start position:0%
taking my question it might be a hard
 
02:23:43.990 --> 02:23:44.000 align:start position:0%
one but
 
02:23:47.429 --> 02:23:47.439 align:start position:0%
if you had to compete
 
02:23:50.550 --> 02:23:50.560 align:start position:0%
with a biological male
 
02:23:53.270 --> 02:23:53.280 align:start position:0%
who identified as a female and that was
 
02:23:55.990 --> 02:23:56.000 align:start position:0%
something that became prevalent in
 
02:23:57.910 --> 02:23:57.920 align:start position:0%
skiing in your sport
 
02:24:00.469 --> 02:24:00.479 align:start position:0%
would you quit
 
02:24:03.190 --> 02:24:03.200 align:start position:0%
um what would there be purpose to your
 
02:24:05.190 --> 02:24:05.200 align:start position:0%
to to competing against someone like
 
02:24:05.200 --> 02:24:06.870 align:start position:0%
to to competing against someone like
that

02:24:06.870 --> 02:24:06.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:24:09.429 --> 02:24:09.439 align:start position:0%
i would probably start out trying but i
 
02:24:12.150 --> 02:24:12.160 align:start position:0%
think i'd get discouraged pretty easily
 
02:24:15.030 --> 02:24:15.040 align:start position:0%
um competing against someone who
 
02:24:16.870 --> 02:24:16.880 align:start position:0%
is a lot taller than me
 
02:24:19.429 --> 02:24:19.439 align:start position:0%
and maybe way more than me and just like
 
02:24:22.710 --> 02:24:22.720 align:start position:0%
biologically is different than me um
 
02:24:24.230 --> 02:24:24.240 align:start position:0%
would be pretty discouraging and i feel
 
02:24:26.230 --> 02:24:26.240 align:start position:0%
like it wouldn't be fair
 
02:24:26.240 --> 02:24:27.429 align:start position:0%
like it wouldn't be fair
follow-up

02:24:27.429 --> 02:24:27.439 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
02:24:28.870 --> 02:24:28.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
02:24:28.880 --> 02:24:29.830 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
um

02:24:29.830 --> 02:24:29.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:31.190 --> 02:24:31.200 align:start position:0%
would you believe
 
02:24:34.230 --> 02:24:34.240 align:start position:0%
that my mother was a
 
02:24:36.630 --> 02:24:36.640 align:start position:0%
phys ed director for the laconia school
 
02:24:40.070 --> 02:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
system for decades and i grew up
 
02:24:41.670 --> 02:24:41.680 align:start position:0%
as a child
 
02:24:41.680 --> 02:24:43.110 align:start position:0%
as a child
competing

02:24:43.110 --> 02:24:43.120 align:start position:0%
competing
 
02:24:43.120 --> 02:24:43.990 align:start position:0%
competing
and

02:24:43.990 --> 02:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:24:46.950 --> 02:24:46.960 align:start position:0%
running and playing and being steeped in
 
02:24:48.710 --> 02:24:48.720 align:start position:0%
women's sports
 
02:24:50.469 --> 02:24:50.479 align:start position:0%
and would you believe
 
02:24:50.479 --> 02:24:52.630 align:start position:0%
and would you believe
that

02:24:52.630 --> 02:24:52.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:24:54.950 --> 02:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
i am well aware of the differences and i
 
02:24:56.630 --> 02:24:56.640 align:start position:0%
know how disappointing it can be when
 
02:24:58.790 --> 02:24:58.800 align:start position:0%
you have to compete against someone when
 
02:25:00.389 --> 02:25:00.399 align:start position:0%
it's not fair
 
02:25:03.270 --> 02:25:03.280 align:start position:0%
yes i believe you it's very um
 
02:25:04.870 --> 02:25:04.880 align:start position:0%
i'm sure we don't have this issue yet in
 
02:25:06.150 --> 02:25:06.160 align:start position:0%
new hampshire but i'm sure it would be
 
02:25:07.670 --> 02:25:07.680 align:start position:0%
very disappointing for the next
 
02:25:11.110 --> 02:25:11.120 align:start position:0%
generations of female athletes thank you
 
02:25:15.590 --> 02:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:17.270 --> 02:25:17.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you very
 
02:25:20.550 --> 02:25:20.560 align:start position:0%
much ms goldstein for taking my question
 
02:25:22.630 --> 02:25:22.640 align:start position:0%
is it also unfair for you to have to
 
02:25:25.270 --> 02:25:25.280 align:start position:0%
compete against a female athlete who is
 
02:25:27.190 --> 02:25:27.200 align:start position:0%
six foot two inches tall and maybe
 
02:25:29.670 --> 02:25:29.680 align:start position:0%
weighs 250 pounds more than you do or
 
02:25:32.070 --> 02:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
has a longer arm reach
 
02:25:33.429 --> 02:25:33.439 align:start position:0%
for swimming
 
02:25:35.830 --> 02:25:35.840 align:start position:0%
um i already do compete against as a
 
02:25:37.670 --> 02:25:37.680 align:start position:0%
rower i compete against girls who are
 
02:25:39.510 --> 02:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
six foot tall i'm actually very short
 
02:25:43.190 --> 02:25:43.200 align:start position:0%
for a rower but i have worked very hard
 
02:25:45.190 --> 02:25:45.200 align:start position:0%
and i'm going division one i'm going to
 
02:25:47.349 --> 02:25:47.359 align:start position:0%
lehigh university and i am very excited
 
02:25:49.429 --> 02:25:49.439 align:start position:0%
about it
 
02:25:51.670 --> 02:25:51.680 align:start position:0%
i do already face disadvantages but i
 
02:25:53.030 --> 02:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
know that
 
02:25:55.429 --> 02:25:55.439 align:start position:0%
those girls are biologically the same as
 
02:25:58.150 --> 02:25:58.160 align:start position:0%
me they may be taller than me but
 
02:25:59.830 --> 02:25:59.840 align:start position:0%
some of the boys on the team are almost
 
02:26:01.830 --> 02:26:01.840 align:start position:0%
seven foot tall and most of their those
 
02:26:03.429 --> 02:26:03.439 align:start position:0%
girls aren't seven foot tall so to
 
02:26:05.110 --> 02:26:05.120 align:start position:0%
compete against someone who would be two
 
02:26:07.510 --> 02:26:07.520 align:start position:0%
feet taller than me rather in that sense
 
02:26:09.750 --> 02:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be fair but if they're
 
02:26:11.830 --> 02:26:11.840 align:start position:0%
biologically have the same
 
02:26:14.070 --> 02:26:14.080 align:start position:0%
bone structure and strength as me then i
 
02:26:16.230 --> 02:26:16.240 align:start position:0%
think i face a shot at being able to
 
02:26:17.670 --> 02:26:17.680 align:start position:0%
beat them
 
02:26:19.270 --> 02:26:19.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for your answer and thank you
 
02:26:21.270 --> 02:26:21.280 align:start position:0%
congratulations on your achievements
 
02:26:22.790 --> 02:26:22.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:26:24.469 --> 02:26:24.479 align:start position:0%
representative soloway
 
02:26:26.790 --> 02:26:26.800 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman uh thank you mr
 
02:26:28.150 --> 02:26:28.160 align:start position:0%
goldstein for taking my question
 
02:26:30.950 --> 02:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
congratulations on going to lehigh
 
02:26:30.960 --> 02:26:31.990 align:start position:0%
congratulations on going to lehigh
um

02:26:31.990 --> 02:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:26:35.030 --> 02:26:35.040 align:start position:0%
do you think that if you trained for the
 
02:26:37.429 --> 02:26:37.439 align:start position:0%
biathlon and i'm confident you know what
 
02:26:39.030 --> 02:26:39.040 align:start position:0%
the biathlon is
 
02:26:41.190 --> 02:26:41.200 align:start position:0%
or that if you trained for competitive
 
02:26:43.349 --> 02:26:43.359 align:start position:0%
sculling and i'm sure you know what that
 
02:26:43.359 --> 02:26:44.230 align:start position:0%
sculling and i'm sure you know what that
is

02:26:44.230 --> 02:26:44.240 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:26:46.950 --> 02:26:46.960 align:start position:0%
or if like dana patrick you trained for
 
02:26:49.030 --> 02:26:49.040 align:start position:0%
automobile racing might you be
 
02:26:51.910 --> 02:26:51.920 align:start position:0%
competitive regardless of gender
 
02:26:55.110 --> 02:26:55.120 align:start position:0%
um i might be competitive yes but if i'm
 
02:26:57.270 --> 02:26:57.280 align:start position:0%
competing against a biological male who
 
02:26:59.990 --> 02:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
is also training the same amount as i
 
02:27:02.309 --> 02:27:02.319 align:start position:0%
am then i might not be as competitive
 
02:27:03.990 --> 02:27:04.000 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for your answer
 
02:27:06.550 --> 02:27:06.560 align:start position:0%
representative gay
 
02:27:09.030 --> 02:27:09.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
02:27:11.590 --> 02:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
there are two other parts to the bill so
 
02:27:14.070 --> 02:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
i wanted to know if your opinion of one
 
02:27:16.550 --> 02:27:16.560 align:start position:0%
of the other parts in your school there
 
02:27:19.510 --> 02:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
may or may not be trans students are you
 
02:27:22.389 --> 02:27:22.399 align:start position:0%
comfortable in the same bathroom with a
 
02:27:25.349 --> 02:27:25.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:27.429 --> 02:27:27.439 align:start position:0%
we do have some trans students at our
 
02:27:27.439 --> 02:27:28.710 align:start position:0%
we do have some trans students at our
school

02:27:28.710 --> 02:27:28.720 align:start position:0%
school
 
02:27:30.950 --> 02:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
personally i have never been in a trance
 
02:27:32.790 --> 02:27:32.800 align:start position:0%
or in a bathroom at the same time as a
 
02:27:34.070 --> 02:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
trans student
 
02:27:34.080 --> 02:27:35.590 align:start position:0%
trans student
um

02:27:35.590 --> 02:27:35.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:27:36.710 --> 02:27:36.720 align:start position:0%
we do
 
02:27:39.110 --> 02:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
i think the majority of them just go to
 
02:27:41.030 --> 02:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
the personalized like single stall
 
02:27:43.830 --> 02:27:43.840 align:start position:0%
bathrooms um but that is something i
 
02:27:49.030 --> 02:27:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:52.150 --> 02:27:52.160 align:start position:0%
thank you very much miss goldstein
 
02:27:55.830 --> 02:27:55.840 align:start position:0%

02:28:00.630 --> 02:28:00.640 align:start position:0%

02:28:06.469 --> 02:28:06.479 align:start position:0%

hampshire
 
02:28:11.190 --> 02:28:11.200 align:start position:0%
i'm here today to speak against this
 
02:28:13.670 --> 02:28:13.680 align:start position:0%
bill this bill and all the others like
 
02:28:16.550 --> 02:28:16.560 align:start position:0%
it have only one intended effect
 
02:28:18.070 --> 02:28:18.080 align:start position:0%
to eliminate the existence of
 
02:28:20.230 --> 02:28:20.240 align:start position:0%
transgender people by any means
 
02:28:20.240 --> 02:28:21.990 align:start position:0%
transgender people by any means
necessary

02:28:21.990 --> 02:28:22.000 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
02:28:24.710 --> 02:28:24.720 align:start position:0%
half of all transgender people
 
02:28:26.309 --> 02:28:26.319 align:start position:0%
are children who are not accepted and
 
02:28:27.910 --> 02:28:27.920 align:start position:0%
supported in their community will
 
02:28:31.110 --> 02:28:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:33.270 --> 02:28:33.280 align:start position:0%
for some of you this is the point and i
 
02:28:35.190 --> 02:28:35.200 align:start position:0%
hope the shame of this cruelty follows
 
02:28:38.309 --> 02:28:38.319 align:start position:0%
you for the rest of your life
 
02:28:40.150 --> 02:28:40.160 align:start position:0%
for others you may not believe the
 
02:28:42.710 --> 02:28:42.720 align:start position:0%
statistics or the severity that these
 
02:28:44.790 --> 02:28:44.800 align:start position:0%
bills have on a fragile and marginalized
 
02:28:46.710 --> 02:28:46.720 align:start position:0%
crew group
 
02:28:50.309 --> 02:28:50.319 align:start position:0%
to those of you i need you to look at me
 
02:28:52.150 --> 02:28:52.160 align:start position:0%
i need you to look up from your boredom
 
02:28:55.670 --> 02:28:55.680 align:start position:0%
and your phones and your doodling
 
02:28:57.830 --> 02:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
this is not a game this is not a
 
02:29:00.070 --> 02:29:00.080 align:start position:0%
political football to be kicked around
 
02:29:02.309 --> 02:29:02.319 align:start position:0%
this is life and death
 
02:29:04.469 --> 02:29:04.479 align:start position:0%
this is a chance of happiness
 
02:29:07.190 --> 02:29:07.200 align:start position:0%
versus a short life of despair
 
02:29:09.270 --> 02:29:09.280 align:start position:0%
this is about a human life
 
02:29:11.670 --> 02:29:11.680 align:start position:0%
this is my child's life
 
02:29:13.910 --> 02:29:13.920 align:start position:0%
there is no gray area there are no
 
02:29:16.070 --> 02:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
difficult choices
 
02:29:18.389 --> 02:29:18.399 align:start position:0%
it is life and death
 
02:29:20.950 --> 02:29:20.960 align:start position:0%
vote down this bill or forever live with
 
02:29:23.590 --> 02:29:23.600 align:start position:0%
that shame of your actions
 
02:29:25.190 --> 02:29:25.200 align:start position:0%
i know that this bill is not about
 
02:29:27.110 --> 02:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
sports but i hear what everyone's
 
02:29:29.510 --> 02:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
talking and i see what is coming
 
02:29:31.750 --> 02:29:31.760 align:start position:0%
my daughter is transgender she has
 
02:29:34.150 --> 02:29:34.160 align:start position:0%
challenges understanding social norms
 
02:29:36.309 --> 02:29:36.319 align:start position:0%
and this year she joined roller derby
 
02:29:37.990 --> 02:29:38.000 align:start position:0%
and i watched her skills grow
 
02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:39.510 align:start position:0%
and i watched her skills grow
exponentially

02:29:39.510 --> 02:29:39.520 align:start position:0%
exponentially
 
02:29:41.429 --> 02:29:41.439 align:start position:0%
i watched her skate in a pod of other
 
02:29:41.439 --> 02:29:42.309 align:start position:0%
i watched her skate in a pod of other
kids

02:29:42.309 --> 02:29:42.319 align:start position:0%
kids
 
02:29:44.309 --> 02:29:44.319 align:start position:0%
all holding hands and trying to move as
 
02:29:45.750 --> 02:29:45.760 align:start position:0%
one group
 
02:29:47.990 --> 02:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
the goal was not competition
 
02:29:49.750 --> 02:29:49.760 align:start position:0%
it was a practice of holding each other
 
02:29:51.590 --> 02:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
up as a team
 
02:29:53.429 --> 02:29:53.439 align:start position:0%
i've watched my daughter change and
 
02:29:55.030 --> 02:29:55.040 align:start position:0%
learn the skills that would bring her
 
02:29:57.349 --> 02:29:57.359 align:start position:0%
through her life successfully because of
 
02:29:57.359 --> 02:29:59.030 align:start position:0%
through her life successfully because of
teamwork

02:29:59.030 --> 02:29:59.040 align:start position:0%
teamwork
 
02:30:01.349 --> 02:30:01.359 align:start position:0%
she is as deserving of these experiences
 
02:30:03.270 --> 02:30:03.280 align:start position:0%
as any other child
 
02:30:05.910 --> 02:30:05.920 align:start position:0%
the act of denying these experiences is
 
02:30:08.550 --> 02:30:08.560 align:start position:0%
discrimination and unconstitutional
 
02:30:10.870 --> 02:30:10.880 align:start position:0%
thank you

02:30:39.190 --> 02:30:39.200 align:start position:0%
organization i wanted to make myself
 
02:30:41.110 --> 02:30:41.120 align:start position:0%
available to answer any questions about
 
02:30:43.190 --> 02:30:43.200 align:start position:0%
how this bill relates to state and
 
02:30:44.950 --> 02:30:44.960 align:start position:0%
federal non-discrimination laws and i
 
02:30:46.469 --> 02:30:46.479 align:start position:0%
hope to and look forward to answering
 
02:30:48.790 --> 02:30:48.800 align:start position:0%
some tough questions about that but in
 
02:30:51.429 --> 02:30:51.439 align:start position:0%
my testimony i wanted to focus on how
 
02:30:54.389 --> 02:30:54.399 align:start position:0%
clarifying the debate around this bill
 
02:30:54.399 --> 02:30:55.110 align:start position:0%
clarifying the debate around this bill
is

02:30:55.110 --> 02:30:55.120 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:30:57.270 --> 02:30:57.280 align:start position:0%
because oftentimes in this area you will
 
02:30:58.790 --> 02:30:58.800 align:start position:0%
hear people on the other side of this
 
02:31:01.349 --> 02:31:01.359 align:start position:0%
issue say something like for example
 
02:31:03.670 --> 02:31:03.680 align:start position:0%
the state can differentiate between men
 
02:31:05.910 --> 02:31:05.920 align:start position:0%
and women it just can't differentiate
 
02:31:07.590 --> 02:31:07.600 align:start position:0%
between transgender women and
 
02:31:09.910 --> 02:31:09.920 align:start position:0%
non-transgender women now that kind of
 
02:31:11.670 --> 02:31:11.680 align:start position:0%
statement can be confusing and
 
02:31:13.990 --> 02:31:14.000 align:start position:0%
disorienting if you're not initiated
 
02:31:16.389 --> 02:31:16.399 align:start position:0%
into the kind of well-constructed system
 
02:31:18.870 --> 02:31:18.880 align:start position:0%
of jargon that cultural progressivism
 
02:31:21.510 --> 02:31:21.520 align:start position:0%
has created around issues of gender and
 
02:31:23.990 --> 02:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
it can be unclear at first glance
 
02:31:26.150 --> 02:31:26.160 align:start position:0%
whether people in that group see any
 
02:31:28.870 --> 02:31:28.880 align:start position:0%
role at all for biology but the debate
 
02:31:31.110 --> 02:31:31.120 align:start position:0%
around this bill very clearly
 
02:31:33.270 --> 02:31:33.280 align:start position:0%
illuminates that issue representative
 
02:31:35.510 --> 02:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
gould's bill is so modest that it would
 
02:31:37.910 --> 02:31:37.920 align:start position:0%
not even exclude a single biologically
 
02:31:40.150 --> 02:31:40.160 align:start position:0%
male athlete from competing in women's
 
02:31:42.790 --> 02:31:42.800 align:start position:0%
sports in new hampshire it simply says
 
02:31:43.910 --> 02:31:43.920 align:start position:0%
the state
 
02:31:46.309 --> 02:31:46.319 align:start position:0%
can recognize biological males and
 
02:31:49.270 --> 02:31:49.280 align:start position:0%
females as real groups of people and can
 
02:31:51.110 --> 02:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
differentiate between people on that
 
02:31:53.510 --> 02:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
basis which has always been part of
 
02:31:55.429 --> 02:31:55.439 align:start position:0%
federal constitutional law in this
 
02:31:55.439 --> 02:31:56.389 align:start position:0%
federal constitutional law in this
country

02:31:56.389 --> 02:31:56.399 align:start position:0%
country
 
02:31:58.550 --> 02:31:58.560 align:start position:0%
and internal agency policies in new
 
02:32:01.590 --> 02:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire and yet we have heard from
 
02:32:05.830 --> 02:32:05.840 align:start position:0%
naomi and from glaad that that by itself
 
02:32:08.309 --> 02:32:08.319 align:start position:0%
is invidious discrimination and is
 
02:32:10.550 --> 02:32:10.560 align:start position:0%
illegal somehow and you don't need to be
 
02:32:12.790 --> 02:32:12.800 align:start position:0%
a lawyer or a constitutional scholar or
 
02:32:15.190 --> 02:32:15.200 align:start position:0%
a philosophy professor to tell that if
 
02:32:18.070 --> 02:32:18.080 align:start position:0%
the state can't even say it reserves the
 
02:32:21.110 --> 02:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
right to consider biological sex then
 
02:32:22.870 --> 02:32:22.880 align:start position:0%
the state can never differentiate
 
02:32:24.309 --> 02:32:24.319 align:start position:0%
between people on the basis of
 
02:32:27.110 --> 02:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
biological sex and if we go one premise
 
02:32:29.429 --> 02:32:29.439 align:start position:0%
deeper i assume my opponents here don't
 
02:32:30.790 --> 02:32:30.800 align:start position:0%
think they're telling you to ignore
 
02:32:30.800 --> 02:32:31.990 align:start position:0%
think they're telling you to ignore
reality

02:32:31.990 --> 02:32:32.000 align:start position:0%
reality
 
02:32:34.469 --> 02:32:34.479 align:start position:0%
so it follows just biological necessity
 
02:32:36.710 --> 02:32:36.720 align:start position:0%
that opponents of this bill don't even
 
02:32:39.110 --> 02:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
think biological males and females are
 
02:32:41.030 --> 02:32:41.040 align:start position:0%
real groups of people
 
02:32:42.950 --> 02:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
um and in fact we can hear that in terms
 
02:32:45.349 --> 02:32:45.359 align:start position:0%
like sex assigned at birth the idea
 
02:32:48.309 --> 02:32:48.319 align:start position:0%
being that the two sexes which are 1.2
 
02:32:51.510 --> 02:32:51.520 align:start position:0%
billion years old are purely imaginary
 
02:32:54.150 --> 02:32:54.160 align:start position:0%
arbitrary social constructs assigned to
 
02:32:56.710 --> 02:32:56.720 align:start position:0%
you by society and this should raise
 
02:32:59.349 --> 02:32:59.359 align:start position:0%
alarming questions not just for whether
 
02:33:01.510 --> 02:33:01.520 align:start position:0%
some biological males can compete in
 
02:33:04.070 --> 02:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
women's sports but whether we can even
 
02:33:06.790 --> 02:33:06.800 align:start position:0%
in the first place have separate sports
 
02:33:09.110 --> 02:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
sports leagues and prison facilities and
 
02:33:13.030 --> 02:33:13.040 align:start position:0%
so on for these two apparently imaginary
 
02:33:15.590 --> 02:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
purely socially constructed groups of
 
02:33:17.429 --> 02:33:17.439 align:start position:0%
people and i would love to take any
 
02:33:20.790 --> 02:33:20.800 align:start position:0%
questions legal or otherwise
 
02:33:22.230 --> 02:33:22.240 align:start position:0%
questions from mr
 
02:33:22.240 --> 02:33:24.230 align:start position:0%
questions from mr
hewitt

02:33:24.230 --> 02:33:24.240 align:start position:0%
hewitt
 
02:33:26.389 --> 02:33:26.399 align:start position:0%
representative thank you mr chairman and
 
02:33:28.309 --> 02:33:28.319 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question i just
 
02:33:30.230 --> 02:33:30.240 align:start position:0%
want to follow up on representative
 
02:33:30.240 --> 02:33:31.270 align:start position:0%
want to follow up on representative
gay's

02:33:31.270 --> 02:33:31.280 align:start position:0%
gay's
 
02:33:32.710 --> 02:33:32.720 align:start position:0%
question would you explain the
 
02:33:35.030 --> 02:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
distinctions between the three elements
 
02:33:36.550 --> 02:33:36.560 align:start position:0%
of the law
 
02:33:38.309 --> 02:33:38.319 align:start position:0%
yes i would like to speak to what
 
02:33:40.790 --> 02:33:40.800 align:start position:0%
representative gay said and i think that
 
02:33:42.710 --> 02:33:42.720 align:start position:0%
what representative gay brings up is
 
02:33:44.389 --> 02:33:44.399 align:start position:0%
important and raises an important
 
02:33:46.469 --> 02:33:46.479 align:start position:0%
opportunity for clarification
 
02:33:49.030 --> 02:33:49.040 align:start position:0%
because as i said earlier this bill does
 
02:33:51.750 --> 02:33:51.760 align:start position:0%
not compel any school board or any
 
02:33:54.710 --> 02:33:54.720 align:start position:0%
entity to adopt any particular policy it
 
02:33:57.990 --> 02:33:58.000 align:start position:0%
reserves the right of state agencies in
 
02:34:00.469 --> 02:34:00.479 align:start position:0%
the state to differentiate based upon
 
02:34:02.550 --> 02:34:02.560 align:start position:0%
biological sex so it would not
 
02:34:04.950 --> 02:34:04.960 align:start position:0%
automatically exclude anyone from
 
02:34:07.270 --> 02:34:07.280 align:start position:0%
anything now in the area of
 
02:34:09.750 --> 02:34:09.760 align:start position:0%
incarceration and i i believe it was
 
02:34:11.190 --> 02:34:11.200 align:start position:0%
representative cannon raised an
 
02:34:13.190 --> 02:34:13.200 align:start position:0%
interesting hypothetical about
 
02:34:15.190 --> 02:34:15.200 align:start position:0%
what about someone who's taken hormonal
 
02:34:16.630 --> 02:34:16.640 align:start position:0%
medication they've had gender
 
02:34:19.030 --> 02:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
reassignment surgery do we really want
 
02:34:21.510 --> 02:34:21.520 align:start position:0%
to incarcerate that person in a men's
 
02:34:24.950 --> 02:34:24.960 align:start position:0%
prison it's actually already the policy
 
02:34:26.150 --> 02:34:26.160 align:start position:0%
of the new hampshire department of
 
02:34:28.790 --> 02:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
corrections that they will consider on a
 
02:34:31.110 --> 02:34:31.120 align:start position:0%
case-by-case basis in such cases uh
 
02:34:33.270 --> 02:34:33.280 align:start position:0%
which facility to assign
 
02:34:35.429 --> 02:34:35.439 align:start position:0%
that person to now this to my knowledge
 
02:34:37.190 --> 02:34:37.200 align:start position:0%
hasn't actually come up
 
02:34:39.110 --> 02:34:39.120 align:start position:0%
yet but they would make a case-by-case
 
02:34:40.950 --> 02:34:40.960 align:start position:0%
consideration in that in that instance
 
02:34:43.190 --> 02:34:43.200 align:start position:0%
and i think that's the right policy
 
02:34:47.190 --> 02:34:47.200 align:start position:0%
however that presumes that the state can
 
02:34:49.349 --> 02:34:49.359 align:start position:0%
take into consideration biological sex
 
02:34:51.910 --> 02:34:51.920 align:start position:0%
and can differentiate on that basis in
 
02:34:54.230 --> 02:34:54.240 align:start position:0%
california for example california's
 
02:34:57.270 --> 02:34:57.280 align:start position:0%
prison policy is even someone who has
 
02:34:59.830 --> 02:34:59.840 align:start position:0%
had no hormonal treatment who has had no
 
02:35:01.830 --> 02:35:01.840 align:start position:0%
gender reassignment surgery and other in
 
02:35:04.070 --> 02:35:04.080 align:start position:0%
other words someone who looks like me
 
02:35:06.150 --> 02:35:06.160 align:start position:0%
if they consistently assert that they
 
02:35:08.710 --> 02:35:08.720 align:start position:0%
are female in california that person
 
02:35:10.790 --> 02:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
will be transferred to a women's prison
 
02:35:13.030 --> 02:35:13.040 align:start position:0%
because in california it's based on
 
02:35:15.510 --> 02:35:15.520 align:start position:0%
gender self-declared gender identity
 
02:35:15.520 --> 02:35:16.550 align:start position:0%
gender self-declared gender identity
period

02:35:16.550 --> 02:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
period
 
02:35:18.790 --> 02:35:18.800 align:start position:0%
so even our status quo in new hampshire
 
02:35:20.870 --> 02:35:20.880 align:start position:0%
where we can make case-by-case
 
02:35:23.190 --> 02:35:23.200 align:start position:0%
considerations and that is appropriate
 
02:35:25.510 --> 02:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
that requires that the state retained
 
02:35:27.510 --> 02:35:27.520 align:start position:0%
the ability to consider
 
02:35:29.750 --> 02:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
biological sex and treat these as real
 
02:35:31.750 --> 02:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
groups of people not purely fictitious
 
02:35:33.750 --> 02:35:33.760 align:start position:0%
social groups
 
02:35:37.750 --> 02:35:37.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative cannon
 
02:35:39.190 --> 02:35:39.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
02:35:41.670 --> 02:35:41.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
02:35:44.389 --> 02:35:44.399 align:start position:0%
you've indicated that the state prison
 
02:35:46.790 --> 02:35:46.800 align:start position:0%
system already has a procedure in place
 
02:35:49.510 --> 02:35:49.520 align:start position:0%
to identify a transgender person where
 
02:35:51.510 --> 02:35:51.520 align:start position:0%
it might be appropriate to incarcerate
 
02:35:51.520 --> 02:35:52.309 align:start position:0%
it might be appropriate to incarcerate
them

02:35:52.309 --> 02:35:52.319 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:35:56.150 --> 02:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
why do we need a statute
 
02:35:57.990 --> 02:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
to do that
 
02:36:00.150 --> 02:36:00.160 align:start position:0%
well the statute doesn't determine where
 
02:36:02.309 --> 02:36:02.319 align:start position:0%
anyone is incarcerated the statute says
 
02:36:04.710 --> 02:36:04.720 align:start position:0%
that the state can recognize biological
 
02:36:06.230 --> 02:36:06.240 align:start position:0%
males and females as real groups of
 
02:36:08.070 --> 02:36:08.080 align:start position:0%
people and can differentiate based on
 
02:36:09.349 --> 02:36:09.359 align:start position:0%
that basis
 
02:36:10.309 --> 02:36:10.319 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire department of
 
02:36:11.910 --> 02:36:11.920 align:start position:0%
corrections policy just just so i'm
 
02:36:14.469 --> 02:36:14.479 align:start position:0%
absolutely clear it doesn't say you
 
02:36:16.070 --> 02:36:16.080 align:start position:0%
assign people based on your gender
 
02:36:17.670 --> 02:36:17.680 align:start position:0%
identity in new hampshire what they do
 
02:36:20.550 --> 02:36:20.560 align:start position:0%
say is that in cases like that the new
 
02:36:21.910 --> 02:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire department of corrections will
 
02:36:24.630 --> 02:36:24.640 align:start position:0%
consider all the factors including the
 
02:36:27.349 --> 02:36:27.359 align:start position:0%
safety of the inmate the safety of other
 
02:36:29.670 --> 02:36:29.680 align:start position:0%
inmates and they make a case-by-case
 
02:36:32.870 --> 02:36:32.880 align:start position:0%
determination unlike in california where
 
02:36:34.950 --> 02:36:34.960 align:start position:0%
it's automatic based on consistently
 
02:36:37.429 --> 02:36:37.439 align:start position:0%
self-declared gender identity and i if i
 
02:36:39.510 --> 02:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
could give one specific example of why
 
02:36:41.670 --> 02:36:41.680 align:start position:0%
this is important if you'd hold on that
 
02:36:43.670 --> 02:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
because we have many more people to
 
02:36:45.590 --> 02:36:45.600 align:start position:0%
testify and we're over time right now
 
02:36:48.309 --> 02:36:48.319 align:start position:0%
and i apologize but uh was
 
02:36:50.870 --> 02:36:50.880 align:start position:0%
there a follow-up rep canon yes i just
 
02:36:52.710 --> 02:36:52.720 align:start position:0%
if you focus on the follow-up but we do
 
02:36:54.790 --> 02:36:54.800 align:start position:0%
need to move forward yes
 
02:36:54.800 --> 02:36:56.070 align:start position:0%
need to move forward yes
so

02:36:56.070 --> 02:36:56.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:36:58.389 --> 02:36:58.399 align:start position:0%
so you said this that still is there's a
 
02:36:59.830 --> 02:36:59.840 align:start position:0%
procedure already in place that's
 
02:37:02.230 --> 02:37:02.240 align:start position:0%
actually fairly extensive
 
02:37:06.389 --> 02:37:06.399 align:start position:0%
so why is this statute a law
 
02:37:06.399 --> 02:37:07.670 align:start position:0%
so why is this statute a law
required

02:37:07.670 --> 02:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
required
 
02:37:09.429 --> 02:37:09.439 align:start position:0%
since it's already done here in new
 
02:37:09.439 --> 02:37:10.550 align:start position:0%
since it's already done here in new
hampshire

02:37:10.550 --> 02:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:37:12.469 --> 02:37:12.479 align:start position:0%
well i i think the example i was about
 
02:37:14.309 --> 02:37:14.319 align:start position:0%
to give is actually responsive to to
 
02:37:16.230 --> 02:37:16.240 align:start position:0%
that question mr chair and the example i
 
02:37:18.870 --> 02:37:18.880 align:start position:0%
was going to point to was there is an
 
02:37:21.590 --> 02:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
11th circuit court of appeals decision
 
02:37:23.990 --> 02:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
about a florida case
 
02:37:26.469 --> 02:37:26.479 align:start position:0%
where this was a case about bathrooms it
 
02:37:27.990 --> 02:37:28.000 align:start position:0%
wasn't about prison but the same
 
02:37:29.990 --> 02:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
reasoning applies where these school
 
02:37:31.349 --> 02:37:31.359 align:start position:0%
districts said well we want to
 
02:37:34.630 --> 02:37:34.640 align:start position:0%
differentiate based upon biological sex
 
02:37:36.790 --> 02:37:36.800 align:start position:0%
and the 11th circuit court of appeals in
 
02:37:39.030 --> 02:37:39.040 align:start position:0%
that case said they ruled against the
 
02:37:41.429 --> 02:37:41.439 align:start position:0%
school board and they said to the school
 
02:37:44.550 --> 02:37:44.560 align:start position:0%
board biological sex the 11th circuit
 
02:37:46.630 --> 02:37:46.640 align:start position:0%
court of appeals said they said what are
 
02:37:48.469 --> 02:37:48.479 align:start position:0%
you even talking about
 
02:37:48.479 --> 02:37:49.429 align:start position:0%
you even talking about
this

02:37:49.429 --> 02:37:49.439 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:37:51.670 --> 02:37:51.680 align:start position:0%
transgender boy in this case the 11th
 
02:37:53.510 --> 02:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
circuit said
 
02:37:55.590 --> 02:37:55.600 align:start position:0%
his driver's license from the state of
 
02:37:58.070 --> 02:37:58.080 align:start position:0%
florida says that he's a male and his
 
02:38:00.230 --> 02:38:00.240 align:start position:0%
birth certificate says that he's a male
 
02:38:01.910 --> 02:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
and according to the 11th circuit court
 
02:38:03.030 --> 02:38:03.040 align:start position:0%
of appeals
 
02:38:05.750 --> 02:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
a gender identity simply is what the
 
02:38:07.429 --> 02:38:07.439 align:start position:0%
state says it is the law does not
 
02:38:10.550 --> 02:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
recognize any other biological sex
 
02:38:13.590 --> 02:38:13.600 align:start position:0%
quote unquote so if if we were to adopt
 
02:38:15.910 --> 02:38:15.920 align:start position:0%
this bill the answer to your question is
 
02:38:17.830 --> 02:38:17.840 align:start position:0%
that the new hampshire department of
 
02:38:20.469 --> 02:38:20.479 align:start position:0%
corrections would retain the ability to
 
02:38:22.630 --> 02:38:22.640 align:start position:0%
make case-by-case determinations and
 
02:38:24.710 --> 02:38:24.720 align:start position:0%
could consider factors like the factors
 
02:38:26.870 --> 02:38:26.880 align:start position:0%
you raised hormonal treatment surgical
 
02:38:29.910 --> 02:38:29.920 align:start position:0%
treatment and consider biological sex
 
02:38:32.710 --> 02:38:32.720 align:start position:0%
also as opposed to automatic assignment
 
02:38:35.030 --> 02:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
based on what the state says like in the
 
02:38:36.790 --> 02:38:36.800 align:start position:0%
11th circuit or based on
 
02:38:38.150 --> 02:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
consistently self-declared gender
 
02:38:41.349 --> 02:38:41.359 align:start position:0%
identity like in california
 
02:38:43.429 --> 02:38:43.439 align:start position:0%
all right thank you uh
 
02:38:46.870 --> 02:38:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:48.790 --> 02:38:48.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you uh
 
02:38:50.630 --> 02:38:50.640 align:start position:0%
attorney hewitt for for taking my
 
02:38:50.640 --> 02:38:51.590 align:start position:0%
attorney hewitt for for taking my
question

02:38:51.590 --> 02:38:51.600 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:38:52.950 --> 02:38:52.960 align:start position:0%
um so we've heard the word
 
02:38:55.590 --> 02:38:55.600 align:start position:0%
discrimination used on a number of
 
02:38:58.469 --> 02:38:58.479 align:start position:0%
occasions here in testimony
 
02:38:58.479 --> 02:38:59.429 align:start position:0%
occasions here in testimony
and

02:38:59.429 --> 02:38:59.439 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:39:01.110 --> 02:39:01.120 align:start position:0%
at the federal level discrimination is
 
02:39:03.910 --> 02:39:03.920 align:start position:0%
defined under under title vii
 
02:39:05.590 --> 02:39:05.600 align:start position:0%
so there was a landmark case several
 
02:39:07.349 --> 02:39:07.359 align:start position:0%
years ago heard by the supreme court
 
02:39:10.389 --> 02:39:10.399 align:start position:0%
bostock versus clayton county and i
 
02:39:13.670 --> 02:39:13.680 align:start position:0%
assume you're familiar with that um so
 
02:39:15.750 --> 02:39:15.760 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to
 
02:39:15.760 --> 02:39:17.510 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to
understand

02:39:17.510 --> 02:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
understand
 
02:39:18.790 --> 02:39:18.800 align:start position:0%
sort of from
 
02:39:23.510 --> 02:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:25.349 --> 02:39:25.359 align:start position:0%
essentially said that the
 
02:39:27.670 --> 02:39:27.680 align:start position:0%
prohibition on discrimination based on
 
02:39:27.680 --> 02:39:28.710 align:start position:0%
prohibition on discrimination based on
sex

02:39:28.710 --> 02:39:28.720 align:start position:0%
sex
 
02:39:31.750 --> 02:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
extends to transgender people and
 
02:39:31.760 --> 02:39:32.630 align:start position:0%
extends to transgender people and
um

02:39:32.630 --> 02:39:32.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:39:34.389 --> 02:39:34.399 align:start position:0%
sexual or you know different sexual
 
02:39:34.399 --> 02:39:35.670 align:start position:0%
sexual or you know different sexual
orientations

02:39:35.670 --> 02:39:35.680 align:start position:0%
orientations
 
02:39:38.469 --> 02:39:38.479 align:start position:0%
um how how might the boss stock case be
 
02:39:41.030 --> 02:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
applied if this were to become law in
 
02:39:42.630 --> 02:39:42.640 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
02:39:44.230 --> 02:39:44.240 align:start position:0%
i think that's a great question i think
 
02:39:46.790 --> 02:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
that the boss stock interpretation of
 
02:39:49.429 --> 02:39:49.439 align:start position:0%
title vii can be very helpful as we
 
02:39:51.510 --> 02:39:51.520 align:start position:0%
think about this bill and i could
 
02:39:53.750 --> 02:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
explain that in a couple of minutes or
 
02:39:55.750 --> 02:39:55.760 align:start position:0%
less i hope with your leave mr chair not
 
02:39:58.630 --> 02:39:58.640 align:start position:0%
here not today okay but in terms of
 
02:40:00.550 --> 02:40:00.560 align:start position:0%
there will be a further discussion on
 
02:40:02.469 --> 02:40:02.479 align:start position:0%
this but we need to hear from everyone
 
02:40:04.950 --> 02:40:04.960 align:start position:0%
because we have other scheduled meetings
 
02:40:06.550 --> 02:40:06.560 align:start position:0%
well i'll do my best to give a few
 
02:40:09.190 --> 02:40:09.200 align:start position:0%
sentences i suppose my word please my
 
02:40:11.110 --> 02:40:11.120 align:start position:0%
few sentence answer would be bostock
 
02:40:13.349 --> 02:40:13.359 align:start position:0%
explained when a law prohibits
 
02:40:15.269 --> 02:40:15.279 align:start position:0%
discrimination because of a certain
 
02:40:18.309 --> 02:40:18.319 align:start position:0%
factor we change that factor and see if
 
02:40:20.150 --> 02:40:20.160 align:start position:0%
we get a different result in the
 
02:40:23.590 --> 02:40:23.600 align:start position:0%
scenario so if you fire let's in new
 
02:40:25.269 --> 02:40:25.279 align:start position:0%
hampshire for example we have a state
 
02:40:27.030 --> 02:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
statute prohibiting discrimination on
 
02:40:29.670 --> 02:40:29.680 align:start position:0%
the basis of gender identity so if a
 
02:40:31.830 --> 02:40:31.840 align:start position:0%
male employee comes into work and says
 
02:40:34.150 --> 02:40:34.160 align:start position:0%
that he identifies as a woman and you
 
02:40:36.150 --> 02:40:36.160 align:start position:0%
fire him to determine if there is gender
 
02:40:37.910 --> 02:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
identity discrimination we change the
 
02:40:39.990 --> 02:40:40.000 align:start position:0%
gender identity so suppose the
 
02:40:41.670 --> 02:40:41.680 align:start position:0%
biologically male employee comes into
 
02:40:43.830 --> 02:40:43.840 align:start position:0%
work and identifies as a woman
 
02:40:45.030 --> 02:40:45.040 align:start position:0%
would you have
 
02:40:46.950 --> 02:40:46.960 align:start position:0%
excuse me as a man that identifies as a
 
02:40:48.070 --> 02:40:48.080 align:start position:0%
man we're going to change the gender
 
02:40:50.550 --> 02:40:50.560 align:start position:0%
identity would you fire him presumably
 
02:40:52.630 --> 02:40:52.640 align:start position:0%
no so there was gender identity
 
02:40:54.790 --> 02:40:54.800 align:start position:0%
discrimination now that the distinction
 
02:40:56.710 --> 02:40:56.720 align:start position:0%
and the way this is particularly helpful
 
02:40:59.429 --> 02:40:59.439 align:start position:0%
is suppose a biologically male athlete
 
02:41:01.670 --> 02:41:01.680 align:start position:0%
wants to compete in women's sports
 
02:41:04.950 --> 02:41:04.960 align:start position:0%
identifies as a woman and is denied to
 
02:41:06.710 --> 02:41:06.720 align:start position:0%
determine if there's gender identity
 
02:41:08.710 --> 02:41:08.720 align:start position:0%
discrimination under bostock what do we
 
02:41:11.269 --> 02:41:11.279 align:start position:0%
do we switch the gender identity
 
02:41:13.830 --> 02:41:13.840 align:start position:0%
so instead we imagine a biologically
 
02:41:17.030 --> 02:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
male athlete identifies as a male and
 
02:41:19.269 --> 02:41:19.279 align:start position:0%
wants to compete in women's sports would
 
02:41:21.110 --> 02:41:21.120 align:start position:0%
the result be different no the result
 
02:41:23.030 --> 02:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
would be the same he would still be
 
02:41:25.510 --> 02:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
denied so what has happened there is not
 
02:41:27.510 --> 02:41:27.520 align:start position:0%
gender identity discrimination like in
 
02:41:29.750 --> 02:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
bostock what's happened there is sex
 
02:41:32.070 --> 02:41:32.080 align:start position:0%
discrimination and sex differentiation
 
02:41:34.309 --> 02:41:34.319 align:start position:0%
is allowed under limited circumstances
 
02:41:38.550 --> 02:41:38.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:40.550 --> 02:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
02:41:44.550 --> 02:41:44.560 align:start position:0%
i will recognize representative weber

question
 
02:41:49.510 --> 02:41:49.520 align:start position:0%
you've stated repeatedly that
 
02:41:52.790 --> 02:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
this doesn't mandate anything it permits
 
02:41:55.590 --> 02:41:55.600 align:start position:0%
somebody from taking
 
02:41:55.600 --> 02:41:56.950 align:start position:0%
somebody from taking

02:42:02.389 --> 02:42:02.399 align:start position:0%
whatever we're calling it into account
 
02:42:04.870 --> 02:42:04.880 align:start position:0%
when making a determination
 
02:42:06.630 --> 02:42:06.640 align:start position:0%
my question is
 
02:42:09.190 --> 02:42:09.200 align:start position:0%
where is the protection
 
02:42:12.790 --> 02:42:12.800 align:start position:0%
when somebody arbitrarily says
 
02:42:15.429 --> 02:42:15.439 align:start position:0%
the only consideration we will ever
 
02:42:15.439 --> 02:42:17.349 align:start position:0%
the only consideration we will ever
consider

02:42:17.349 --> 02:42:17.359 align:start position:0%
consider
 
02:42:19.990 --> 02:42:20.000 align:start position:0%
is the sex you were born with rather
 
02:42:21.429 --> 02:42:21.439 align:start position:0%
than anything
 
02:42:23.910 --> 02:42:23.920 align:start position:0%
that has transpired since what is the
 
02:42:27.110 --> 02:42:27.120 align:start position:0%
protection for transgender people under
 
02:42:29.349 --> 02:42:29.359 align:start position:0%
that scheme
 
02:42:31.349 --> 02:42:31.359 align:start position:0%
well for example in the hypothetical i
 
02:42:33.750 --> 02:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
just gave which would be under under 354
 
02:42:35.590 --> 02:42:35.600 align:start position:0%
a which is our state nondiscrimination
 
02:42:37.990 --> 02:42:38.000 align:start position:0%
law clearly if you fired a biologically
 
02:42:40.630 --> 02:42:40.640 align:start position:0%
male employee for identifying as a woman
 
02:42:42.389 --> 02:42:42.399 align:start position:0%
that would be a violation of our state
 
02:42:44.950 --> 02:42:44.960 align:start position:0%
law and there isn't anything in this law
 
02:42:46.469 --> 02:42:46.479 align:start position:0%
that would change that
 
02:42:48.309 --> 02:42:48.319 align:start position:0%
um so we we do have state
 
02:42:50.070 --> 02:42:50.080 align:start position:0%
non-discrimination protections for
 
02:42:51.590 --> 02:42:51.600 align:start position:0%
transgender people and those would
 
02:42:55.349 --> 02:42:55.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:56.710 --> 02:42:56.720 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
02:42:58.150 --> 02:42:58.160 align:start position:0%

02:43:00.150 --> 02:43:00.160 align:start position:0%
and no further questions thank you for
 
02:43:02.070 --> 02:43:02.080 align:start position:0%
your testimony thank you
 
02:43:04.150 --> 02:43:04.160 align:start position:0%
like to recognize
 
02:43:06.389 --> 02:43:06.399 align:start position:0%
i think it's abby

let's get the rating correct uh opposes
 
02:43:13.510 --> 02:43:13.520 align:start position:0%
the bill and represents
 
02:43:13.520 --> 02:43:15.750 align:start position:0%
the bill and represents
herself

02:43:15.750 --> 02:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
herself
 
02:43:15.760 --> 02:43:17.830 align:start position:0%
herself
hi

02:43:17.830 --> 02:43:17.840 align:start position:0%
hi
 
02:43:20.710 --> 02:43:20.720 align:start position:0%
you getting your clock on there
 
02:43:23.110 --> 02:43:23.120 align:start position:0%
three minutes no i don't hi thank you
 
02:43:25.269 --> 02:43:25.279 align:start position:0%
for taking my testimony i'm here to
 
02:43:27.670 --> 02:43:27.680 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill my name is abby maxwell
 
02:43:28.710 --> 02:43:28.720 align:start position:0%
i'm going to speak a little bit
 
02:43:30.710 --> 02:43:30.720 align:start position:0%
differently than i planned today because
 
02:43:32.790 --> 02:43:32.800 align:start position:0%
i'm listening to all of this
 
02:43:35.190 --> 02:43:35.200 align:start position:0%
misinformation in here and it is
 
02:43:37.510 --> 02:43:37.520 align:start position:0%
shocking um
 
02:43:39.830 --> 02:43:39.840 align:start position:0%
so i currently work at the library at
 
02:43:41.590 --> 02:43:41.600 align:start position:0%
the st paul's school and my typical job
 
02:43:43.910 --> 02:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
there is to work the circulation desk a
 
02:43:46.150 --> 02:43:46.160 align:start position:0%
few days ago my boss asked me to speak
 
02:43:48.630 --> 02:43:48.640 align:start position:0%
to her civil rights class instead about
 
02:43:50.469 --> 02:43:50.479 align:start position:0%
transgender rights so the students could
 
02:43:52.230 --> 02:43:52.240 align:start position:0%
get a glimpse into the human side of the
 
02:43:52.240 --> 02:43:53.190 align:start position:0%
get a glimpse into the human side of the
issue

02:43:53.190 --> 02:43:53.200 align:start position:0%
issue
 
02:43:55.190 --> 02:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
i would rather not spend my time opening
 
02:43:57.910 --> 02:43:57.920 align:start position:0%
my family's wounds to strangers but i'm
 
02:44:00.790 --> 02:44:00.800 align:start position:0%
unclear what other option i have if i'm
 
02:44:02.630 --> 02:44:02.640 align:start position:0%
going to at least try to protect my
 
02:44:04.550 --> 02:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
daughter this seems to be the only
 
02:44:04.560 --> 02:44:05.990 align:start position:0%
daughter this seems to be the only
pathway

02:44:05.990 --> 02:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
pathway
 
02:44:07.670 --> 02:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
i went to the class and i told them my
 
02:44:09.990 --> 02:44:10.000 align:start position:0%
story my daughter is transgender she
 
02:44:11.910 --> 02:44:11.920 align:start position:0%
socially transitioned when she was six
 
02:44:14.150 --> 02:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
the summer before second grade we lived
 
02:44:15.670 --> 02:44:15.680 align:start position:0%
in the small town that my father had
 
02:44:17.750 --> 02:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
come from five five miles from my
 
02:44:19.349 --> 02:44:19.359 align:start position:0%
grandfather's and great grandmother's
 
02:44:21.510 --> 02:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
childhood home in the county my family
 
02:44:24.630 --> 02:44:24.640 align:start position:0%
has been in for some 300 years a week
 
02:44:26.469 --> 02:44:26.479 align:start position:0%
into her school year our governor signed
 
02:44:28.710 --> 02:44:28.720 align:start position:0%
the law that granted her equal
 
02:44:31.110 --> 02:44:31.120 align:start position:0%
protections our district began the
 
02:44:33.030 --> 02:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
process of passing a policy to comply
 
02:44:35.269 --> 02:44:35.279 align:start position:0%
with the law and protect the students
 
02:44:37.030 --> 02:44:37.040 align:start position:0%
neighbors and strangers alike came out
 
02:44:38.630 --> 02:44:38.640 align:start position:0%
of their woodwork to speak against
 
02:44:40.710 --> 02:44:40.720 align:start position:0%
transgender people in general and
 
02:44:43.030 --> 02:44:43.040 align:start position:0%
sometimes my daughter in particular they
 
02:44:45.110 --> 02:44:45.120 align:start position:0%
had all the usual claims transgender
 
02:44:46.630 --> 02:44:46.640 align:start position:0%
people are a threat to bathrooms and
 
02:44:49.030 --> 02:44:49.040 align:start position:0%
locker rooms to sports they also claim
 
02:44:50.389 --> 02:44:50.399 align:start position:0%
that my daughter threatened the mental
 
02:44:51.910 --> 02:44:51.920 align:start position:0%
health of their children and that using
 
02:44:54.790 --> 02:44:54.800 align:start position:0%
her correct pronouns was in for speech
 
02:44:57.190 --> 02:44:57.200 align:start position:0%
not surprisingly during this time period
 
02:44:59.110 --> 02:44:59.120 align:start position:0%
our seven-year-old was relentlessly
 
02:45:00.469 --> 02:45:00.479 align:start position:0%
bullied at school
 
02:45:02.070 --> 02:45:02.080 align:start position:0%
with enough digging i found out that the
 
02:45:04.070 --> 02:45:04.080 align:start position:0%
bullying would never stop because
 
02:45:05.910 --> 02:45:05.920 align:start position:0%
education around her around her
 
02:45:07.830 --> 02:45:07.840 align:start position:0%
transition had been blocked the
 
02:45:09.429 --> 02:45:09.439 align:start position:0%
superintendent had made a rule that the
 
02:45:11.190 --> 02:45:11.200 align:start position:0%
word transgender could not be used in
 
02:45:13.429 --> 02:45:13.439 align:start position:0%
the classroom setting when pressed he
 
02:45:14.630 --> 02:45:14.640 align:start position:0%
wrote me a letter to say that my
 
02:45:16.790 --> 02:45:16.800 align:start position:0%
daughter's identity was inappropriate to
 
02:45:18.550 --> 02:45:18.560 align:start position:0%
her second grade class
 
02:45:19.990 --> 02:45:20.000 align:start position:0%
meanwhile parents we had been to
 
02:45:22.070 --> 02:45:22.080 align:start position:0%
birthday parties with advertised
 
02:45:23.910 --> 02:45:23.920 align:start position:0%
meetings in the local paper
 
02:45:25.510 --> 02:45:25.520 align:start position:0%
get-togethers for those against
 
02:45:27.030 --> 02:45:27.040 align:start position:0%
transgender rights
 
02:45:28.950 --> 02:45:28.960 align:start position:0%
my husband and i kept our doors locked
 
02:45:30.630 --> 02:45:30.640 align:start position:0%
and our curtains drawn
 
02:45:32.790 --> 02:45:32.800 align:start position:0%
when we had the energy to drag ourselves
 
02:45:35.590 --> 02:45:35.600 align:start position:0%
up off of the ground we packed our house
 
02:45:37.750 --> 02:45:37.760 align:start position:0%
we thought we would return west to the
 
02:45:39.910 --> 02:45:39.920 align:start position:0%
liberal city where we had met but then
 
02:45:42.309 --> 02:45:42.319 align:start position:0%
our daughter has no civil rights there
 
02:45:44.070 --> 02:45:44.080 align:start position:0%
she has no civil rights in more than
 
02:45:46.230 --> 02:45:46.240 align:start position:0%
half the states in this country and it's
 
02:45:48.230 --> 02:45:48.240 align:start position:0%
getting worse by the minute
 
02:45:50.150 --> 02:45:50.160 align:start position:0%
before that class my boss had warned me
 
02:45:51.190 --> 02:45:51.200 align:start position:0%
that though her students were
 
02:45:53.349 --> 02:45:53.359 align:start position:0%
intelligent and respectful sports was
 
02:45:55.190 --> 02:45:55.200 align:start position:0%
the one place where transgender rights
 
02:45:57.429 --> 02:45:57.439 align:start position:0%
was hard for them as many were athletes
 
02:45:57.439 --> 02:45:59.830 align:start position:0%
was hard for them as many were athletes
themselves

02:45:59.830 --> 02:45:59.840 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
02:46:02.150 --> 02:46:02.160 align:start position:0%
but the students were great just as my
 
02:46:03.910 --> 02:46:03.920 align:start position:0%
boss had said they would be they asked
 
02:46:05.670 --> 02:46:05.680 align:start position:0%
me questions most of which were along
 
02:46:08.230 --> 02:46:08.240 align:start position:0%
the lines of wait what happened
 
02:46:10.389 --> 02:46:10.399 align:start position:0%
one kind teenage girl asked if my
 
02:46:13.030 --> 02:46:13.040 align:start position:0%
daughter had any experience with sports
 
02:46:15.510 --> 02:46:15.520 align:start position:0%
i told her about skiing and roller derby
 
02:46:17.429 --> 02:46:17.439 align:start position:0%
i told her that it was remarkable to me
 
02:46:19.349 --> 02:46:19.359 align:start position:0%
to watch how a vital sport how vital a
 
02:46:21.429 --> 02:46:21.439 align:start position:0%
sport can be to a human and to their
 
02:46:23.830 --> 02:46:23.840 align:start position:0%
embodiment i was tempted to get in the
 
02:46:26.469 --> 02:46:26.479 align:start position:0%
weeds as my boss and i had briefly done
 
02:46:28.309 --> 02:46:28.319 align:start position:0%
before entering the classroom to say
 
02:46:30.309 --> 02:46:30.319 align:start position:0%
that these bans on trans girls in sports
 
02:46:32.070 --> 02:46:32.080 align:start position:0%
threatened one of our most vulnerable
 
02:46:34.150 --> 02:46:34.160 align:start position:0%
groups of children in some states as
 
02:46:36.389 --> 02:46:36.399 align:start position:0%
young as kindergarten that many of the
 
02:46:38.150 --> 02:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
girls they attempt to ban have access
 
02:46:40.950 --> 02:46:40.960 align:start position:0%
gender at affirming care and have bodies
 
02:46:42.790 --> 02:46:42.800 align:start position:0%
indecipherable from their cisgender
 
02:46:44.790 --> 02:46:44.800 align:start position:0%
peers that even if they don't the
 
02:46:46.550 --> 02:46:46.560 align:start position:0%
suggestion that only girls of a certain
 
02:46:49.030 --> 02:46:49.040 align:start position:0%
size should play is reminiscent of the
 
02:46:51.269 --> 02:46:51.279 align:start position:0%
dystopian novels i read
 
02:46:53.429 --> 02:46:53.439 align:start position:0%
that trans athletes have been included
 
02:46:55.269 --> 02:46:55.279 align:start position:0%
by law in the state of california for
 
02:46:57.110 --> 02:46:57.120 align:start position:0%
years and there has never once been a
 
02:46:59.349 --> 02:46:59.359 align:start position:0%
single problem reported that they've
 
02:47:01.910 --> 02:47:01.920 align:start position:0%
been included in the ncaa for a decade
 
02:47:03.990 --> 02:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
and in all the legislative hearings last
 
02:47:05.910 --> 02:47:05.920 align:start position:0%
year lawmakers all across the country
 
02:47:07.910 --> 02:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
could only ever repeat the same two
 
02:47:10.070 --> 02:47:10.080 align:start position:0%
athletes over and over again which is a
 
02:47:12.630 --> 02:47:12.640 align:start position:0%
percentage that is close to zero
 
02:47:14.790 --> 02:47:14.800 align:start position:0%
but the facts don't seem to matter i've
 
02:47:16.469 --> 02:47:16.479 align:start position:0%
been to some of these legislative
 
02:47:19.269 --> 02:47:19.279 align:start position:0%
sessions before first they attempted to
 
02:47:21.269 --> 02:47:21.279 align:start position:0%
criminalize my daughter's health care
 
02:47:22.950 --> 02:47:22.960 align:start position:0%
and the second to ban her from playing
 
02:47:24.950 --> 02:47:24.960 align:start position:0%
sports with all the other girls that is
 
02:47:27.510 --> 02:47:27.520 align:start position:0%
there's a supposed fear that her body
 
02:47:29.269 --> 02:47:29.279 align:start position:0%
will be too big or have too much
 
02:47:31.830 --> 02:47:31.840 align:start position:0%
testosterone to play but then there's
 
02:47:34.630 --> 02:47:34.640 align:start position:0%
also an effort to outlaw the care that
 
02:47:37.269 --> 02:47:37.279 align:start position:0%
will spare her that future
 
02:47:39.750 --> 02:47:39.760 align:start position:0%
taken together i am unclear what i am
 
02:47:42.230 --> 02:47:42.240 align:start position:0%
supposed to understand as the goal of
 
02:47:44.710 --> 02:47:44.720 align:start position:0%
course the facts don't matter there will
 
02:47:46.870 --> 02:47:46.880 align:start position:0%
always be the possibility that a trans
 
02:47:49.510 --> 02:47:49.520 align:start position:0%
girl will come along in any body at all
 
02:47:50.950 --> 02:47:50.960 align:start position:0%
and win
 
02:47:53.750 --> 02:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
in a world of infinite possibilities
 
02:47:56.790 --> 02:47:56.800 align:start position:0%
either you attempt to block that rare
 
02:47:58.950 --> 02:47:58.960 align:start position:0%
particular fate by squelching out the
 
02:48:01.750 --> 02:48:01.760 align:start position:0%
existence of an entire group or you
 
02:48:04.389 --> 02:48:04.399 align:start position:0%
accept transgender people as a vital
 
02:48:08.309 --> 02:48:08.319 align:start position:0%
part of the fabric of humanity
 
02:48:09.349 --> 02:48:09.359 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:48:12.790 --> 02:48:12.800 align:start position:0%
i would happily take your questions
 
02:48:16.469 --> 02:48:16.479 align:start position:0%
we have questions for ms maxwell
 
02:48:17.750 --> 02:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
none being here we thank you for your
 
02:48:17.760 --> 02:48:21.670 align:start position:0%
none being here we thank you for your
testimony

02:48:21.670 --> 02:48:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:23.269 --> 02:48:23.279 align:start position:0%
i'd like to recognize
 
02:48:28.070 --> 02:48:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:31.510 --> 02:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
he's in support of the bill
 
02:48:35.910 --> 02:48:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:37.429 --> 02:48:37.439 align:start position:0%
okay three minutes mr burley if you
 
02:48:45.990 --> 02:48:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:50.710 --> 02:48:50.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:53.269 --> 02:48:53.279 align:start position:0%
ah thank you dear legislators as a
 
02:48:55.269 --> 02:48:55.279 align:start position:0%
competitive athlete and the father of
 
02:48:57.030 --> 02:48:57.040 align:start position:0%
ten and seven-year-old daughters with
 
02:48:59.429 --> 02:48:59.439 align:start position:0%
their own lofty athletic goals
 
02:49:03.429 --> 02:49:03.439 align:start position:0%
i urge you to support hb 1180
 
02:49:05.510 --> 02:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
most people will readily admit that men
 
02:49:07.830 --> 02:49:07.840 align:start position:0%
possess certain physical characteristics
 
02:49:10.150 --> 02:49:10.160 align:start position:0%
that give us a distinct advantage in
 
02:49:11.750 --> 02:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
many sports
 
02:49:15.830 --> 02:49:15.840 align:start position:0%
biological males are on average bigger
 
02:49:18.389 --> 02:49:18.399 align:start position:0%
faster and more physically aggressive
 
02:49:20.870 --> 02:49:20.880 align:start position:0%
than their female counterparts
 
02:49:23.269 --> 02:49:23.279 align:start position:0%
anyone of sound minds should accept this
 
02:49:26.309 --> 02:49:26.319 align:start position:0%
as an indisputable fact
 
02:49:28.550 --> 02:49:28.560 align:start position:0%
don't agree with me let's ask caitlyn
 
02:49:32.389 --> 02:49:32.399 align:start position:0%
jenner about her opinion on this subject
 
02:49:34.550 --> 02:49:34.560 align:start position:0%
or maybe ask the female student athletes
 
02:49:37.110 --> 02:49:37.120 align:start position:0%
who were recently humiliated by two
 
02:49:39.190 --> 02:49:39.200 align:start position:0%
transgender athletes at the ivy league
 
02:49:42.870 --> 02:49:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:44.469 --> 02:49:44.479 align:start position:0%
i went to the lawrenceville school in
 
02:49:46.469 --> 02:49:46.479 align:start position:0%
middlebury college where i was a highly
 
02:49:48.309 --> 02:49:48.319 align:start position:0%
decorated football basketball and
 
02:49:49.830 --> 02:49:49.840 align:start position:0%
baseball player
 
02:49:53.030 --> 02:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
to this day i actively compete at a high
 
02:49:55.830 --> 02:49:55.840 align:start position:0%
level as an amateur skier and platform
 
02:49:58.150 --> 02:49:58.160 align:start position:0%
tennis player
 
02:49:59.910 --> 02:49:59.920 align:start position:0%
as an athlete and father i can say
 
02:50:01.910 --> 02:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
definitively that transgender
 
02:50:04.230 --> 02:50:04.240 align:start position:0%
individuals have no place
 
02:50:07.349 --> 02:50:07.359 align:start position:0%
competing in sports against athletes of
 
02:50:09.349 --> 02:50:09.359 align:start position:0%
the opposite sex
 
02:50:12.230 --> 02:50:12.240 align:start position:0%
it is patently unfair and disgraceful
 
02:50:14.710 --> 02:50:14.720 align:start position:0%
that this type of nonsense is permitted
 
02:50:18.070 --> 02:50:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:20.230 --> 02:50:20.240 align:start position:0%
regardless of your sexual identity
 
02:50:23.110 --> 02:50:23.120 align:start position:0%
anyone born male has no place competing
 
02:50:25.590 --> 02:50:25.600 align:start position:0%
as a woman in amateur athletics
 
02:50:28.630 --> 02:50:28.640 align:start position:0%
period and end of story
 
02:50:30.469 --> 02:50:30.479 align:start position:0%
while i fully support giving trans
 
02:50:32.950 --> 02:50:32.960 align:start position:0%
athletes the opportunity to compete i
 
02:50:35.830 --> 02:50:35.840 align:start position:0%
also refuse to stand idly by as we watch
 
02:50:38.630 --> 02:50:38.640 align:start position:0%
biological men destroy their female
 
02:50:42.790 --> 02:50:42.800 align:start position:0%
competitors in the name of sport
 
02:50:44.790 --> 02:50:44.800 align:start position:0%
you have it in your power to put an end
 
02:50:47.349 --> 02:50:47.359 align:start position:0%
to this insanity and ensure that we
 
02:50:50.150 --> 02:50:50.160 align:start position:0%
re-level the playing field for all
 
02:50:52.710 --> 02:50:52.720 align:start position:0%
athletes in new hampshire
 
02:50:55.030 --> 02:50:55.040 align:start position:0%
i respectfully urge you to vote in favor

just a few minutes ago
 
02:51:12.550 --> 02:51:12.560 align:start position:0%
the statement that there's only really
 
02:51:14.710 --> 02:51:14.720 align:start position:0%

in the last year or two
 
02:51:23.590 --> 02:51:23.600 align:start position:0%
every couple of weeks
 
02:51:27.030 --> 02:51:27.040 align:start position:0%
another event another team another place
 
02:51:28.550 --> 02:51:28.560 align:start position:0%

02:51:33.590 --> 02:51:33.600 align:start position:0%
with me
 
02:51:37.110 --> 02:51:37.120 align:start position:0%

02:51:42.870 --> 02:51:42.880 align:start position:0%

02:51:42.880 --> 02:51:43.590 align:start position:0%
thank you very much sir thank you
i

02:51:43.590 --> 02:51:43.600 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:51:48.389 --> 02:51:48.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:51.030 --> 02:51:51.040 align:start position:0%
he opposes the bill and representing the
 
02:51:55.510 --> 02:51:55.520 align:start position:0%
aclu of new hampshire mr connect
 
02:51:56.710 --> 02:51:56.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman members of the
 
02:51:58.389 --> 02:51:58.399 align:start position:0%
committee my name is frank knack i'm
 
02:51:59.910 --> 02:51:59.920 align:start position:0%
policy director with the aclu of new
 
02:52:01.349 --> 02:52:01.359 align:start position:0%
hampshire and we're here in strong
 
02:52:05.190 --> 02:52:05.200 align:start position:0%
opposition to hb 1180.
 
02:52:07.110 --> 02:52:07.120 align:start position:0%
as my colleague from glad mentioned
 
02:52:08.469 --> 02:52:08.479 align:start position:0%
driver's license or amended birth
 
02:52:10.150 --> 02:52:10.160 align:start position:0%
certificates aren't required in order to
 
02:52:12.790 --> 02:52:12.800 align:start position:0%
be recognized by the gender that you are
 
02:52:14.710 --> 02:52:14.720 align:start position:0%
but this bill is going to invite
 
02:52:16.469 --> 02:52:16.479 align:start position:0%
discrimination and exclusion that will
 
02:52:18.870 --> 02:52:18.880 align:start position:0%
be in violation of the us constitution
 
02:52:20.710 --> 02:52:20.720 align:start position:0%
as well as title ix of the civil rights
 
02:52:22.150 --> 02:52:22.160 align:start position:0%
act i think it was mentioned a little
 
02:52:23.590 --> 02:52:23.600 align:start position:0%
while ago
 
02:52:25.910 --> 02:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
some questions about post bostok
 
02:52:28.710 --> 02:52:28.720 align:start position:0%
and just to clarify two federal appeals
 
02:52:30.870 --> 02:52:30.880 align:start position:0%
courts in the in the years since bostik
 
02:52:32.790 --> 02:52:32.800 align:start position:0%
have affirmed that title ix prohibition
 
02:52:35.590 --> 02:52:35.600 align:start position:0%
on sex discrimination likewise prohibits
 
02:52:37.190 --> 02:52:37.200 align:start position:0%
discrimination against transgender
 
02:52:38.790 --> 02:52:38.800 align:start position:0%
students when assessing single-sex
 
02:52:41.269 --> 02:52:41.279 align:start position:0%
spaces and activities
 
02:52:42.950 --> 02:52:42.960 align:start position:0%
and i think it's also important to kind
 
02:52:44.630 --> 02:52:44.640 align:start position:0%
of get rid of some of the myths that we
 
02:52:46.309 --> 02:52:46.319 align:start position:0%
continue to hear
 
02:52:48.150 --> 02:52:48.160 align:start position:0%
when we talk about prisons according to
 
02:52:49.670 --> 02:52:49.680 align:start position:0%
the national center for transgender
 
02:52:49.680 --> 02:52:51.030 align:start position:0%
the national center for transgender
equality

02:52:51.030 --> 02:52:51.040 align:start position:0%
equality
 
02:52:53.990 --> 02:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
trans people incarcerated are 10 times
 
02:52:56.070 --> 02:52:56.080 align:start position:0%
more likely to face sexual assault by
 
02:52:58.950 --> 02:52:58.960 align:start position:0%
other incarcerated people and five times
 
02:53:01.670 --> 02:53:01.680 align:start position:0%
more likely to face sexual assault by
 
02:53:03.110 --> 02:53:03.120 align:start position:0%
prison staff
 
02:53:06.550 --> 02:53:06.560 align:start position:0%
that is deeply deeply deeply concerning
 
02:53:08.150 --> 02:53:08.160 align:start position:0%
in addition
 
02:53:10.150 --> 02:53:10.160 align:start position:0%
again getting back to the to the debate
 
02:53:12.469 --> 02:53:12.479 align:start position:0%
over uh quote unquote advantages in
 
02:53:12.479 --> 02:53:13.510 align:start position:0%
over uh quote unquote advantages in
sports

02:53:13.510 --> 02:53:13.520 align:start position:0%
sports
 
02:53:15.830 --> 02:53:15.840 align:start position:0%
transgender people of all ages have been
 
02:53:17.670 --> 02:53:17.680 align:start position:0%
participating in sports consistent with
 
02:53:20.070 --> 02:53:20.080 align:start position:0%
their gender at all levels including the
 
02:53:24.070 --> 02:53:24.080 align:start position:0%
olympics since 2004.
 
02:53:25.510 --> 02:53:25.520 align:start position:0%
in all those years there has been
 
02:53:27.750 --> 02:53:27.760 align:start position:0%
absolutely no categorical dominance by
 
02:53:29.590 --> 02:53:29.600 align:start position:0%
women and girls who are transgender at
 
02:53:31.590 --> 02:53:31.600 align:start position:0%
any level
 
02:53:33.429 --> 02:53:33.439 align:start position:0%
athletic success is based on many
 
02:53:35.510 --> 02:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
factors that vary from sport to sport
 
02:53:37.510 --> 02:53:37.520 align:start position:0%
trans athletes like other athletes have
 
02:53:40.150 --> 02:53:40.160 align:start position:0%
no single body type there is absolutely
 
02:53:41.910 --> 02:53:41.920 align:start position:0%
no merit to the claim that women and
 
02:53:44.150 --> 02:53:44.160 align:start position:0%
girls who are transgender automatically
 
02:53:46.630 --> 02:53:46.640 align:start position:0%
have advantages in sport
 
02:53:47.750 --> 02:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
in fact
 
02:53:49.269 --> 02:53:49.279 align:start position:0%
particularly when referring to young
 
02:53:51.110 --> 02:53:51.120 align:start position:0%
people many trans athletes have
 
02:53:52.870 --> 02:53:52.880 align:start position:0%
physiological characteristics that are
 
02:53:54.550 --> 02:53:54.560 align:start position:0%
typical of peers with their gender
 
02:53:57.429 --> 02:53:57.439 align:start position:0%
identity and not their assigned sex
 
02:53:58.630 --> 02:53:58.640 align:start position:0%
this means that a girl who is
 
02:54:00.550 --> 02:54:00.560 align:start position:0%
transgender may have more physiological
 
02:54:00.560 --> 02:54:02.150 align:start position:0%
transgender may have more physiological
characteristics

02:54:02.150 --> 02:54:02.160 align:start position:0%
characteristics
 
02:54:04.389 --> 02:54:04.399 align:start position:0%
typical of non-transgender girls than
 
02:54:06.389 --> 02:54:06.399 align:start position:0%
transgender boys thus any data
 
02:54:08.309 --> 02:54:08.319 align:start position:0%
purporting to compare the relative
 
02:54:09.830 --> 02:54:09.840 align:start position:0%
athletic abilities typical of
 
02:54:11.670 --> 02:54:11.680 align:start position:0%
non-transgender girls
 
02:54:14.950 --> 02:54:14.960 align:start position:0%
and uh not of non-transgender boys
 
02:54:17.349 --> 02:54:17.359 align:start position:0%
girls and non-transgender boys simply do
 
02:54:20.950 --> 02:54:20.960 align:start position:0%
not apply to most transgender youth
 
02:54:22.950 --> 02:54:22.960 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to take any questions any
 
02:54:22.960 --> 02:54:23.990 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to take any questions any
questions

02:54:23.990 --> 02:54:24.000 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:54:27.349 --> 02:54:27.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:29.030 --> 02:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
i just had a question of the chair was
 
02:54:32.150 --> 02:54:32.160 align:start position:0%
there written testimony and if so did it
 
02:54:35.030 --> 02:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
get stopped somewhere uh not we've not
 
02:54:36.550 --> 02:54:36.560 align:start position:0%
received anything
 
02:54:38.070 --> 02:54:38.080 align:start position:0%
i will be submitting written testimony
 
02:54:40.150 --> 02:54:40.160 align:start position:0%
but we were as i think a lot of people a
 
02:54:41.910 --> 02:54:41.920 align:start position:0%
little confused with what this bill was
 
02:54:43.429 --> 02:54:43.439 align:start position:0%
trying to do until we heard it explained
 
02:54:45.110 --> 02:54:45.120 align:start position:0%
and i wanted to reserve the opportunity
 
02:54:45.120 --> 02:54:45.990 align:start position:0%
and i wanted to reserve the opportunity
to

02:54:45.990 --> 02:54:46.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:54:48.630 --> 02:54:48.640 align:start position:0%
have the sponsors i just i just wondered
 
02:54:50.790 --> 02:54:50.800 align:start position:0%
if something had gotten stuck somewhere
 
02:54:51.990 --> 02:54:52.000 align:start position:0%
but i will definitely be sending thank
 
02:54:53.590 --> 02:54:53.600 align:start position:0%
you information out with sites to
 
02:54:55.750 --> 02:54:55.760 align:start position:0%
everything that i just noticed okay
 
02:54:57.750 --> 02:54:57.760 align:start position:0%
representative gay
 
02:54:59.830 --> 02:54:59.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
02:55:01.269 --> 02:55:01.279 align:start position:0%
my question
 
02:55:03.990 --> 02:55:04.000 align:start position:0%
do you differentiate in any way between
 
02:55:08.309 --> 02:55:08.319 align:start position:0%
a trans person whose change is done uh
 
02:55:11.349 --> 02:55:11.359 align:start position:0%
very very young like you know before
 
02:55:12.630 --> 02:55:12.640 align:start position:0%
first grade
 
02:55:12.640 --> 02:55:14.070 align:start position:0%
first grade
and

02:55:14.070 --> 02:55:14.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:55:15.510 --> 02:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
like the swimmers that we're talking
 
02:55:18.070 --> 02:55:18.080 align:start position:0%
about which was done after they
 
02:55:18.080 --> 02:55:19.349 align:start position:0%
about which was done after they
became

02:55:19.349 --> 02:55:19.359 align:start position:0%
became
 
02:55:21.110 --> 02:55:21.120 align:start position:0%
uh adult
 
02:55:23.990 --> 02:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
adult size they weren't adult age yet
 
02:55:26.309 --> 02:55:26.319 align:start position:0%
but they were late teenagers
 
02:55:28.710 --> 02:55:28.720 align:start position:0%
from it is not my place to decide who's
 
02:55:30.309 --> 02:55:30.319 align:start position:0%
what someone considers their gender
 
02:55:30.319 --> 02:55:31.429 align:start position:0%
what someone considers their gender
identity

02:55:31.429 --> 02:55:31.439 align:start position:0%
identity
 
02:55:34.630 --> 02:55:34.640 align:start position:0%
uh so that it's not my decision
 
02:55:37.030 --> 02:55:37.040 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
02:55:40.150 --> 02:55:40.160 align:start position:0%
oh follow me representative folsom
 
02:55:41.590 --> 02:55:41.600 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman thank you for taking
 
02:55:44.150 --> 02:55:44.160 align:start position:0%
my question i was trying to take down
 
02:55:47.030 --> 02:55:47.040 align:start position:0%
notes um and so i just can you we go
 
02:55:48.230 --> 02:55:48.240 align:start position:0%
back to
 
02:55:49.910 --> 02:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
i think i heard you saying that
 
02:55:52.389 --> 02:55:52.399 align:start position:0%
transgenders are often
 
02:55:55.429 --> 02:55:55.439 align:start position:0%
uh victims of attacks in prisons yes
 
02:55:55.439 --> 02:55:56.469 align:start position:0%
uh victims of attacks in prisons yes
okay

02:55:56.469 --> 02:55:56.479 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:55:56.479 --> 02:55:57.590 align:start position:0%
okay
um

02:55:57.590 --> 02:55:57.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:55:57.600 --> 02:55:58.389 align:start position:0%
um
by

02:55:58.389 --> 02:55:58.399 align:start position:0%
by
 
02:56:02.230 --> 02:56:02.240 align:start position:0%
other prisoners as well as staff yes so
 
02:56:04.070 --> 02:56:04.080 align:start position:0%
this is according to the national center
 
02:56:06.870 --> 02:56:06.880 align:start position:0%
center for transgender equality uh trans
 
02:56:09.030 --> 02:56:09.040 align:start position:0%
people are 10 times more likely to face
 
02:56:11.269 --> 02:56:11.279 align:start position:0%
sexual assault by other incarcerated
 
02:56:13.670 --> 02:56:13.680 align:start position:0%
people and five times more likely to pay
 
02:56:15.990 --> 02:56:16.000 align:start position:0%
sexual assault from prison staff
 
02:56:16.000 --> 02:56:17.830 align:start position:0%
sexual assault from prison staff
would

02:56:17.830 --> 02:56:17.840 align:start position:0%
would
 
02:56:19.110 --> 02:56:19.120 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
02:56:23.030 --> 02:56:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:23.040 --> 02:56:24.630 align:start position:0%
 
safer

02:56:24.630 --> 02:56:24.640 align:start position:0%
safer
 
02:56:28.070 --> 02:56:28.080 align:start position:0%
if we had separate but equal units
 
02:56:30.230 --> 02:56:30.240 align:start position:0%
within a prison
 
02:56:30.240 --> 02:56:31.269 align:start position:0%
within a prison
system

02:56:31.269 --> 02:56:31.279 align:start position:0%
system
 
02:56:33.910 --> 02:56:33.920 align:start position:0%
so that they were more protected
 
02:56:33.920 --> 02:56:36.070 align:start position:0%
so that they were more protected
from

02:56:36.070 --> 02:56:36.080 align:start position:0%
from
 
02:56:37.750 --> 02:56:37.760 align:start position:0%
other inmates
 
02:56:39.590 --> 02:56:39.600 align:start position:0%
who might mean them harm just because
 
02:56:41.190 --> 02:56:41.200 align:start position:0%
they're trans
 
02:56:41.200 --> 02:56:43.990 align:start position:0%
they're trans
or

02:56:43.990 --> 02:56:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:45.590 --> 02:56:45.600 align:start position:0%
they could have
 
02:56:48.150 --> 02:56:48.160 align:start position:0%
guards that were more carefully trained
 
02:56:51.269 --> 02:56:51.279 align:start position:0%
in being responsive to trans would that
 
02:56:53.750 --> 02:56:53.760 align:start position:0%
would that make it easier for trans
 
02:56:53.760 --> 02:56:55.349 align:start position:0%
would that make it easier for trans
prisoners

02:56:55.349 --> 02:56:55.359 align:start position:0%
prisoners
 
02:56:57.990 --> 02:56:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:59.670 --> 02:56:59.680 align:start position:0%
what that would result in is you would
 
02:57:01.349 --> 02:57:01.359 align:start position:0%
be discriminating against the class of
 
02:57:02.870 --> 02:57:02.880 align:start position:0%
people from the government's failure to
 
02:57:05.269 --> 02:57:05.279 align:start position:0%
protect them and so it's the burden is
 
02:57:07.670 --> 02:57:07.680 align:start position:0%
on the government our prisons and jails
 
02:57:07.680 --> 02:57:09.269 align:start position:0%
on the government our prisons and jails
have

02:57:09.269 --> 02:57:09.279 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:57:11.110 --> 02:57:11.120 align:start position:0%
endemic violence and i think it's
 
02:57:13.590 --> 02:57:13.600 align:start position:0%
important that the state correct that
 
02:57:13.600 --> 02:57:14.389 align:start position:0%
important that the state correct that
issue

02:57:14.389 --> 02:57:14.399 align:start position:0%
issue
 
02:57:16.870 --> 02:57:16.880 align:start position:0%
and do so on an individualized basis but
 
02:57:19.349 --> 02:57:19.359 align:start position:0%
not to have broad category
 
02:57:22.950 --> 02:57:22.960 align:start position:0%
to categorize entire people and then to
 
02:57:24.309 --> 02:57:24.319 align:start position:0%
segregate people based on those
 
02:57:24.319 --> 02:57:26.469 align:start position:0%
segregate people based on those
characteristics

02:57:26.469 --> 02:57:26.479 align:start position:0%
characteristics
 
02:57:30.550 --> 02:57:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:32.550 --> 02:57:32.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
02:57:34.870 --> 02:57:34.880 align:start position:0%
taking my question um
 
02:57:38.870 --> 02:57:38.880 align:start position:0%
anecdotally i have recently
 
02:57:41.269 --> 02:57:41.279 align:start position:0%
become familiar with the
 
02:57:42.870 --> 02:57:42.880 align:start position:0%
inner workings of
 
02:57:44.710 --> 02:57:44.720 align:start position:0%
federal prisons
 
02:57:44.720 --> 02:57:45.590 align:start position:0%
federal prisons
and

02:57:45.590 --> 02:57:45.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:57:47.670 --> 02:57:47.680 align:start position:0%
in the particular prison that i'm
 
02:57:51.110 --> 02:57:51.120 align:start position:0%
thinking of they actually are allowing
 
02:57:51.120 --> 02:57:51.990 align:start position:0%
thinking of they actually are allowing
male

02:57:51.990 --> 02:57:52.000 align:start position:0%
male
 
02:57:53.830 --> 02:57:53.840 align:start position:0%
biological male
 
02:57:55.750 --> 02:57:55.760 align:start position:0%
prisoners because it's a it's a
 
02:57:58.230 --> 02:57:58.240 align:start position:0%
biological male prison
 
02:58:01.030 --> 02:58:01.040 align:start position:0%
to go to go through
 
02:58:03.349 --> 02:58:03.359 align:start position:0%
uh surgeries and
 
02:58:06.469 --> 02:58:06.479 align:start position:0%
and transition into
 
02:58:09.830 --> 02:58:09.840 align:start position:0%
their identification as a as a female
 
02:58:11.750 --> 02:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
do you know
 
02:58:14.469 --> 02:58:14.479 align:start position:0%
in that circumstance are those prisoners
 
02:58:15.830 --> 02:58:15.840 align:start position:0%
who get
 
02:58:19.910 --> 02:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
federal funds to change their
 
02:58:23.190 --> 02:58:23.200 align:start position:0%
orientation are they reassigned
 
02:58:26.070 --> 02:58:26.080 align:start position:0%
to female prisons after they transition
 
02:58:28.870 --> 02:58:28.880 align:start position:0%
i it's just a i just was wondering i'm
 
02:58:30.469 --> 02:58:30.479 align:start position:0%
not familiar with how federal prisons
 
02:58:30.479 --> 02:58:31.269 align:start position:0%
not familiar with how federal prisons
are

02:58:31.269 --> 02:58:31.279 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:58:32.870 --> 02:58:32.880 align:start position:0%
set up at this point but i'd be happy to
 
02:58:34.950 --> 02:58:34.960 align:start position:0%
look into that and get back to you okay
 
02:58:36.630 --> 02:58:36.640 align:start position:0%

presented a national level of statistics
 
02:58:50.630 --> 02:58:50.640 align:start position:0%
and a question has come up in this
 
02:58:52.309 --> 02:58:52.319 align:start position:0%
committee several times during this
 
02:58:53.910 --> 02:58:53.920 align:start position:0%

hampshire
 
02:58:58.070 --> 02:58:58.080 align:start position:0%
do we have circumstances in the state of

new hampshire
 
02:59:02.230 --> 02:59:02.240 align:start position:0%
specifically to back up the national
 
02:59:07.190 --> 02:59:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:09.110 --> 02:59:09.120 align:start position:0%
in reference to prisons
 
02:59:11.269 --> 02:59:11.279 align:start position:0%
folks in the corrections field
 
02:59:14.230 --> 02:59:14.240 align:start position:0%
committing crimes against inmates in new
 
02:59:15.750 --> 02:59:15.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire those are that's based on the
 
02:59:17.190 --> 02:59:17.200 align:start position:0%
national survey
 
02:59:18.790 --> 02:59:18.800 align:start position:0%
i do not have anything specific from new
 
02:59:18.800 --> 02:59:21.910 align:start position:0%
i do not have anything specific from new
hampshire

02:59:21.910 --> 02:59:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:24.870 --> 02:59:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:26.469 --> 02:59:26.479 align:start position:0%
no further questions being seen thank
 
02:59:28.790 --> 02:59:28.800 align:start position:0%
you very much mr kanek thank you
 
02:59:33.830 --> 02:59:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:36.550 --> 02:59:36.560 align:start position:0%
in support of the bill and representing
 
02:59:36.560 --> 02:59:38.389 align:start position:0%
in support of the bill and representing
herself

02:59:38.389 --> 02:59:38.399 align:start position:0%
herself
 
02:59:39.670 --> 02:59:39.680 align:start position:0%
thank you committee chair thank you
 
02:59:41.670 --> 02:59:41.680 align:start position:0%
committee members i want to start by
 
02:59:44.070 --> 02:59:44.080 align:start position:0%
saying the bottom line is is that we're
 
02:59:44.080 --> 02:59:45.030 align:start position:0%
saying the bottom line is is that we're
talking

02:59:45.030 --> 02:59:45.040 align:start position:0%
talking
 
02:59:46.870 --> 02:59:46.880 align:start position:0%
this bill is about
 
02:59:48.870 --> 02:59:48.880 align:start position:0%
biological sexes and it's about
 
02:59:51.750 --> 02:59:51.760 align:start position:0%
protecting all people so the fact that
 
02:59:54.389 --> 02:59:54.399 align:start position:0%
it keeps being divided and saying well
 
02:59:56.630 --> 02:59:56.640 align:start position:0%
we need to protect the transgender how
 
02:59:58.870 --> 02:59:58.880 align:start position:0%
about we just protect everybody
 
03:00:03.030 --> 03:00:03.040 align:start position:0%
this bill allows for that this bill says
 
03:00:05.510 --> 03:00:05.520 align:start position:0%
the state is not going to dictate it
 
03:00:08.230 --> 03:00:08.240 align:start position:0%
will be dictated at the local level and
 
03:00:12.630 --> 03:00:12.640 align:start position:0%
if that person's individual rights of
 
03:00:16.389 --> 03:00:16.399 align:start position:0%
autonomy is violated they have they can
 
03:00:18.230 --> 03:00:18.240 align:start position:0%
take appropriate action
 
03:00:20.790 --> 03:00:20.800 align:start position:0%
so that's the bottom line here i am so
 
03:00:24.870 --> 03:00:24.880 align:start position:0%
tired of so many people working so hard
 
03:00:28.309 --> 03:00:28.319 align:start position:0%
to divide us it is time to stop that and
 
03:00:31.429 --> 03:00:31.439 align:start position:0%
i want to personally apologize for the
 
03:00:33.510 --> 03:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
folks that feel
 
03:00:34.710 --> 03:00:34.720 align:start position:0%
whether it's
 
03:00:36.469 --> 03:00:36.479 align:start position:0%
justified or not
 
03:00:38.710 --> 03:00:38.720 align:start position:0%
that they feel afraid because they're
 
03:00:41.349 --> 03:00:41.359 align:start position:0%
different the bottom line is we're all
 
03:00:43.750 --> 03:00:43.760 align:start position:0%
uniquely different if i had lived my
 
03:00:46.630 --> 03:00:46.640 align:start position:0%
entire life being fearful because i was
 
03:00:48.790 --> 03:00:48.800 align:start position:0%
under five feet tall where would that
 
03:00:52.389 --> 03:00:52.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:54.790 --> 03:00:54.800 align:start position:0%
um with regards to suicide for
 
03:00:56.790 --> 03:00:56.800 align:start position:0%
transgender um
 
03:00:58.870 --> 03:00:58.880 align:start position:0%
i believe that i believe that it's a
 
03:01:01.830 --> 03:01:01.840 align:start position:0%
huge problem i also believe it's also a
 
03:01:05.269 --> 03:01:05.279 align:start position:0%
huge problem for folks who are different
 
03:01:07.349 --> 03:01:07.359 align:start position:0%
in any way shape or form
 
03:01:10.469 --> 03:01:10.479 align:start position:0%
we are looking at we need to be looking
 
03:01:12.469 --> 03:01:12.479 align:start position:0%
at that
 
03:01:13.750 --> 03:01:13.760 align:start position:0%
the disease
 
03:01:15.429 --> 03:01:15.439 align:start position:0%
not i'm not saying transgender is
 
03:01:18.790 --> 03:01:18.800 align:start position:0%
disease but the the the mindset
 
03:01:21.190 --> 03:01:21.200 align:start position:0%
that i'm different so i need to be
 
03:01:23.670 --> 03:01:23.680 align:start position:0%
fearful we need to be looking at that we
 
03:01:26.630 --> 03:01:26.640 align:start position:0%
need to stop saying well you know you
 
03:01:29.030 --> 03:01:29.040 align:start position:0%
look different so i should be afraid of
 
03:01:29.040 --> 03:01:29.750 align:start position:0%
look different so i should be afraid of
you

03:01:29.750 --> 03:01:29.760 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:01:32.150 --> 03:01:32.160 align:start position:0%
that's like saying i'm open carrying so
 
03:01:34.230 --> 03:01:34.240 align:start position:0%
you should be afraid of me new hampshire
 
03:01:36.230 --> 03:01:36.240 align:start position:0%
prides ourselves on being able to open
 
03:01:36.240 --> 03:01:37.190 align:start position:0%
prides ourselves on being able to open
carry

03:01:37.190 --> 03:01:37.200 align:start position:0%
carry
 
03:01:40.230 --> 03:01:40.240 align:start position:0%
and we're here saying because you choose
 
03:01:40.240 --> 03:01:41.349 align:start position:0%
and we're here saying because you choose
to

03:01:41.349 --> 03:01:41.359 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:01:42.870 --> 03:01:42.880 align:start position:0%
appear different
 
03:01:44.550 --> 03:01:44.560 align:start position:0%
in the world
 
03:01:46.870 --> 03:01:46.880 align:start position:0%
i'm going to discriminate against you
 
03:01:49.910 --> 03:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
it's not fair it's not appropriate
 
03:01:51.269 --> 03:01:51.279 align:start position:0%
um it's
 
03:01:54.309 --> 03:01:54.319 align:start position:0%
same thing with color of skin same thing
 
03:01:56.550 --> 03:01:56.560 align:start position:0%
bottom line is
 
03:01:58.710 --> 03:01:58.720 align:start position:0%
everything about
 
03:02:02.389 --> 03:02:02.399 align:start position:0%
this bill is good the problem is is that
 
03:02:04.710 --> 03:02:04.720 align:start position:0%
everyone's focusing on the transgender
 
03:02:07.910 --> 03:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
population that's not okay stop focusing
 
03:02:09.830 --> 03:02:09.840 align:start position:0%
on the division
 
03:02:12.950 --> 03:02:12.960 align:start position:0%
i love the fact that i that i have
 
03:02:15.670 --> 03:02:15.680 align:start position:0%
transgender friends who belong to my
 
03:02:18.469 --> 03:02:18.479 align:start position:0%
females motorcycle group do i identify
 
03:02:21.590 --> 03:02:21.600 align:start position:0%
them as transgender no i identify them
 
03:02:23.349 --> 03:02:23.359 align:start position:0%
as lydia and bonnie
 
03:02:25.670 --> 03:02:25.680 align:start position:0%
and i always will and that's what needs
 
03:02:28.469 --> 03:02:28.479 align:start position:0%
to start happening and so we need to
 
03:02:31.269 --> 03:02:31.279 align:start position:0%
start we need to start wrapping our as a
 
03:02:33.990 --> 03:02:34.000 align:start position:0%
society wrapping our
 
03:02:37.349 --> 03:02:37.359 align:start position:0%
our arms around all our uniqueness and
 
03:02:39.510 --> 03:02:39.520 align:start position:0%
all our differences because the bottom
 
03:02:42.710 --> 03:02:42.720 align:start position:0%
line is there's there's bad actors
 
03:02:42.720 --> 03:02:44.469 align:start position:0%
line is there's there's bad actors
everywhere

03:02:44.469 --> 03:02:44.479 align:start position:0%
everywhere
 
03:02:47.269 --> 03:02:47.279 align:start position:0%
this bill will help protect
 
03:02:51.110 --> 03:02:51.120 align:start position:0%
us from bad actors regardless of
 
03:02:52.870 --> 03:02:52.880 align:start position:0%
how they identify
 
03:02:54.469 --> 03:02:54.479 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:02:56.070 --> 03:02:56.080 align:start position:0%
thank you miss chester is our questions
 
03:02:58.150 --> 03:02:58.160 align:start position:0%

appreciate you taking my testimony
 
03:03:19.110 --> 03:03:19.120 align:start position:0%
um three sections to this bill
 
03:03:21.269 --> 03:03:21.279 align:start position:0%
um three minutes is going to be hard i
 
03:03:23.670 --> 03:03:23.680 align:start position:0%
hope maybe we can cover some of it in
 
03:03:25.750 --> 03:03:25.760 align:start position:0%
questions there's been a lot of focus on
 
03:03:25.760 --> 03:03:26.950 align:start position:0%
questions there's been a lot of focus on
sports

03:03:26.950 --> 03:03:26.960 align:start position:0%
sports
 
03:03:30.070 --> 03:03:30.080 align:start position:0%
i did send to all of you this morning a
 
03:03:34.550 --> 03:03:34.560 align:start position:0%
copy of my testimony against hp 98
 
03:03:36.790 --> 03:03:36.800 align:start position:0%
because that was in committee
 
03:03:38.830 --> 03:03:38.840 align:start position:0%
last year was voted
 
03:03:42.550 --> 03:03:42.560 align:start position:0%
on inexpedient to legislate after a lot
 
03:03:45.510 --> 03:03:45.520 align:start position:0%
of study by the children and family law
 
03:03:45.520 --> 03:03:46.590 align:start position:0%
of study by the children and family law
committee

03:03:46.590 --> 03:03:46.600 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:03:49.830 --> 03:03:49.840 align:start position:0%
21-0 it went on the consent calendar in
 
03:03:52.070 --> 03:03:52.080 align:start position:0%
january of this year
 
03:03:53.510 --> 03:03:53.520 align:start position:0%
had this
 
03:03:56.070 --> 03:03:56.080 align:start position:0%
bill about sports been brought
 
03:03:58.389 --> 03:03:58.399 align:start position:0%
it would not have been allowed as a bill
 
03:04:00.550 --> 03:04:00.560 align:start position:0%
about sports
 
03:04:02.630 --> 03:04:02.640 align:start position:0%
so i think you can take that off the
 
03:04:05.190 --> 03:04:05.200 align:start position:0%
table although i would be happy after
 
03:04:07.750 --> 03:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
all the misinformation i've heard
 
03:04:11.349 --> 03:04:11.359 align:start position:0%
to address things about the sports
 
03:04:14.150 --> 03:04:14.160 align:start position:0%
but there is in my testimony to that
 
03:04:14.160 --> 03:04:15.269 align:start position:0%
but there is in my testimony to that
committee

03:04:15.269 --> 03:04:15.279 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:04:18.550 --> 03:04:18.560 align:start position:0%
a good deal about why
 
03:04:21.429 --> 03:04:21.439 align:start position:0%
this does not make sense
 
03:04:24.150 --> 03:04:24.160 align:start position:0%
to have what i would call invidious
 
03:04:27.110 --> 03:04:27.120 align:start position:0%
discrimination against transgender
 
03:04:27.120 --> 03:04:29.910 align:start position:0%
discrimination against transgender
females

03:04:29.910 --> 03:04:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:32.550 --> 03:04:32.560 align:start position:0%
in this state or any state although it
 
03:04:35.349 --> 03:04:35.359 align:start position:0%
exists in many other states
 
03:04:37.830 --> 03:04:37.840 align:start position:0%
the other two sections of this bill well
 
03:04:39.910 --> 03:04:39.920 align:start position:0%
i think the criminal justice system is
 
03:04:41.990 --> 03:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
currently dealing with this as best they
 
03:04:42.000 --> 03:04:43.670 align:start position:0%
currently dealing with this as best they
can

03:04:43.670 --> 03:04:43.680 align:start position:0%
can
 
03:04:46.309 --> 03:04:46.319 align:start position:0%
it's something that worries me and i
 
03:04:48.389 --> 03:04:48.399 align:start position:0%
know as of a couple of years ago there
 
03:04:50.349 --> 03:04:50.359 align:start position:0%
were 10
 
03:04:53.349 --> 03:04:53.359 align:start position:0%
transgender people in
 
03:04:55.429 --> 03:04:55.439 align:start position:0%
prison they were in a section of the
 
03:04:58.790 --> 03:04:58.800 align:start position:0%
men's prison trying to be protected
 
03:05:01.349 --> 03:05:01.359 align:start position:0%
i assume and i hope it's true that
 
03:05:02.870 --> 03:05:02.880 align:start position:0%
because they had not completed
 
03:05:02.880 --> 03:05:04.790 align:start position:0%
because they had not completed
transition

03:05:04.790 --> 03:05:04.800 align:start position:0%
transition
 
03:05:07.990 --> 03:05:08.000 align:start position:0%
i completed transition some years ago
 
03:05:10.710 --> 03:05:10.720 align:start position:0%
i am very much not gender dysphoric
 
03:05:12.870 --> 03:05:12.880 align:start position:0%
anymore as a female
 
03:05:14.710 --> 03:05:14.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:05:17.590 --> 03:05:17.600 align:start position:0%
i i hope that that kind of thing is
 
03:05:19.429 --> 03:05:19.439 align:start position:0%
still allowed
 
03:05:19.439 --> 03:05:20.469 align:start position:0%
still allowed
and

03:05:20.469 --> 03:05:20.479 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:05:23.269 --> 03:05:23.279 align:start position:0%
to get to the the last part it's it's an
 
03:05:25.990 --> 03:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
absolute mess if you pass this bill that
 
03:05:29.030 --> 03:05:29.040 align:start position:0%
allows governmental units of any side
 
03:05:31.349 --> 03:05:31.359 align:start position:0%
school boards whatever
 
03:05:33.910 --> 03:05:33.920 align:start position:0%
to have their own policies separate from
 
03:05:35.990 --> 03:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
the state policy
 
03:05:38.030 --> 03:05:38.040 align:start position:0%
which is enshrined in our
 
03:05:41.349 --> 03:05:41.359 align:start position:0%
non-discrimination statutes
 
03:05:43.750 --> 03:05:43.760 align:start position:0%
what happens then we'll have a school
 
03:05:45.670 --> 03:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
board in one place say
 
03:05:47.910 --> 03:05:47.920 align:start position:0%
the transgender girl can't use this
 
03:05:49.269 --> 03:05:49.279 align:start position:0%
locker room
 
03:05:51.590 --> 03:05:51.600 align:start position:0%
whereas a transgender girl is
 
03:05:53.670 --> 03:05:53.680 align:start position:0%
participating on the sports team from a
 
03:05:55.990 --> 03:05:56.000 align:start position:0%
team that's coming there
 
03:05:56.000 --> 03:05:57.349 align:start position:0%
team that's coming there
please

03:05:57.349 --> 03:05:57.359 align:start position:0%
please
 
03:05:59.110 --> 03:05:59.120 align:start position:0%

03:06:13.110 --> 03:06:13.120 align:start position:0%

03:06:23.670 --> 03:06:23.680 align:start position:0%

i have
 
03:06:35.269 --> 03:06:35.279 align:start position:0%
when we first brought these bills
 
03:06:38.950 --> 03:06:38.960 align:start position:0%
around gender discrimination statute
 
03:06:40.790 --> 03:06:40.800 align:start position:0%

03:06:43.269 --> 03:06:43.279 align:start position:0%
health association we've retrenched a
 
03:06:44.950 --> 03:06:44.960 align:start position:0%
little bit about how many bills we try
 
03:06:47.590 --> 03:06:47.600 align:start position:0%
to cover so we have not got a position
 
03:06:50.230 --> 03:06:50.240 align:start position:0%
on this so i am representing myself
 
03:06:52.150 --> 03:06:52.160 align:start position:0%
but i have a lot of information about
 
03:06:54.870 --> 03:06:54.880 align:start position:0%
this okay uh then dr smith is there any

oh excuse me there you are mr seven
 
03:07:23.510 --> 03:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:26.790 --> 03:07:26.800 align:start position:0%
representing himself already um
 
03:07:28.389 --> 03:07:28.399 align:start position:0%
ladies and gentlemen
 
03:07:30.070 --> 03:07:30.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time today i did you
 
03:07:31.670 --> 03:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
hit them okay yeah just get right up on
 
03:07:33.269 --> 03:07:33.279 align:start position:0%
the mic if you will yeah mr chairman if
 
03:07:34.630 --> 03:07:34.640 align:start position:0%
i would ask especially for the folks
 
03:07:35.830 --> 03:07:35.840 align:start position:0%
that are watching this at home you kind
 
03:07:37.429 --> 03:07:37.439 align:start position:0%
of they really need to eat the mic in
 
03:07:42.710 --> 03:07:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:45.269 --> 03:07:45.279 align:start position:0%
so good okay
 
03:07:47.750 --> 03:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
alrighty um as a former athlete and avid
 
03:07:50.550 --> 03:07:50.560 align:start position:0%
weight lifter i find it unfair for trans
 
03:07:52.309 --> 03:07:52.319 align:start position:0%
athletes to compete against their
 
03:07:54.870 --> 03:07:54.880 align:start position:0%
cisgender counterparts for instance a
 
03:07:57.110 --> 03:07:57.120 align:start position:0%
biological male track athlete
 
03:07:59.190 --> 03:07:59.200 align:start position:0%
transitioning into a female has a clear
 
03:08:02.070 --> 03:08:02.080 align:start position:0%
biological advantage in competition
 
03:08:03.830 --> 03:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
men have a greater capacity for muscle
 
03:08:06.790 --> 03:08:06.800 align:start position:0%
growth and potential whereas women fall
 
03:08:06.800 --> 03:08:07.910 align:start position:0%
growth and potential whereas women fall
short

03:08:07.910 --> 03:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
short
 
03:08:10.710 --> 03:08:10.720 align:start position:0%
this leads to a huge gap when competing
 
03:08:13.590 --> 03:08:13.600 align:start position:0%
i support trans athletes but i have but
 
03:08:15.750 --> 03:08:15.760 align:start position:0%
to have them compete against anyone
 
03:08:16.790 --> 03:08:16.800 align:start position:0%
other than
 
03:08:19.349 --> 03:08:19.359 align:start position:0%
those of the same biological sex seems
 
03:08:21.990 --> 03:08:22.000 align:start position:0%
simply unfair
 
03:08:22.000 --> 03:08:22.790 align:start position:0%
simply unfair
um

03:08:22.790 --> 03:08:22.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:08:22.800 --> 03:08:25.190 align:start position:0%
um
just

03:08:25.190 --> 03:08:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:27.590 --> 03:08:27.600 align:start position:0%
it's just i don't know
 
03:08:29.670 --> 03:08:29.680 align:start position:0%
that'll be it
 
03:08:31.990 --> 03:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr walford and questions for
 
03:08:34.150 --> 03:08:34.160 align:start position:0%
mr walford
 
03:08:35.670 --> 03:08:35.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony sir thank
 
03:08:35.680 --> 03:08:39.269 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony sir thank
you

03:08:39.269 --> 03:08:39.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:41.590 --> 03:08:41.600 align:start position:0%
dr uh
 
03:08:41.600 --> 03:08:43.030 align:start position:0%
dr uh
recognize

03:08:43.030 --> 03:08:43.040 align:start position:0%
recognize
 
03:08:47.030 --> 03:08:47.040 align:start position:0%

03:08:56.870 --> 03:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
i think this means i'm the closer for
 
03:08:58.389 --> 03:08:58.399 align:start position:0%
the group um
 
03:09:00.150 --> 03:09:00.160 align:start position:0%

laws contained in rsa chapter 354a
 
03:09:18.710 --> 03:09:18.720 align:start position:0%
the department does not take a position
 
03:09:21.030 --> 03:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
on the underlying policy but is here to
 
03:09:22.630 --> 03:09:22.640 align:start position:0%
provide some general information
 
03:09:25.110 --> 03:09:25.120 align:start position:0%
regarding confusion we see arising as a
 
03:09:28.389 --> 03:09:28.399 align:start position:0%
result of the proposed legislation
 
03:09:30.950 --> 03:09:30.960 align:start position:0%
during the 2019 legislative session
 
03:09:33.349 --> 03:09:33.359 align:start position:0%
the legislature included in rsa chapter
 
03:09:33.359 --> 03:09:34.790 align:start position:0%
the legislature included in rsa chapter
354a

03:09:34.790 --> 03:09:34.800 align:start position:0%
354a
 
03:09:36.630 --> 03:09:36.640 align:start position:0%
protection from discrimination for
 
03:09:39.190 --> 03:09:39.200 align:start position:0%
students in public schools this includes
 
03:09:42.630 --> 03:09:42.640 align:start position:0%
protection based upon gender identity
 
03:09:44.950 --> 03:09:44.960 align:start position:0%
this bill presents confusion in that one
 
03:09:47.910 --> 03:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
set of laws requires schools to prevent
 
03:09:49.830 --> 03:09:49.840 align:start position:0%
discrimination based upon gender
 
03:09:52.389 --> 03:09:52.399 align:start position:0%
identity but the proposed legislation
 
03:09:54.389 --> 03:09:54.399 align:start position:0%
purports to permit
 
03:09:57.670 --> 03:09:57.680 align:start position:0%
public entities to limit access based
 
03:10:00.389 --> 03:10:00.399 align:start position:0%
upon sex versus gender identity
 
03:10:03.830 --> 03:10:03.840 align:start position:0%
this could expose schools to liability
 
03:10:05.429 --> 03:10:05.439 align:start position:0%
to come as they try to comply with both
 
03:10:06.870 --> 03:10:06.880 align:start position:0%
laws or as they if they choose to comply
 
03:10:10.309 --> 03:10:10.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:13.030 --> 03:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
similarly this could create confusion
 
03:10:15.510 --> 03:10:15.520 align:start position:0%
regarding how the state as an employer
 
03:10:17.190 --> 03:10:17.200 align:start position:0%
can best protect employees from
 
03:10:18.630 --> 03:10:18.640 align:start position:0%
discrimination based upon gender
 
03:10:21.110 --> 03:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
identity examples came up kind of you
 
03:10:22.630 --> 03:10:22.640 align:start position:0%
know there's been discussion here about
 
03:10:25.510 --> 03:10:25.520 align:start position:0%
which bathrooms to use
 
03:10:27.670 --> 03:10:27.680 align:start position:0%
hiring an individual as an employee this
 
03:10:29.349 --> 03:10:29.359 align:start position:0%
changes the laws with respect to
 
03:10:31.750 --> 03:10:31.760 align:start position:0%
driver's license and birth certificates
 
03:10:33.590 --> 03:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
if those are changed the sex markers or
 
03:10:35.910 --> 03:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
the gender markers are are changed there
 
03:10:37.510 --> 03:10:37.520 align:start position:0%
is no way if those are presented as
 
03:10:39.910 --> 03:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
someone's lawful identification for the
 
03:10:41.670 --> 03:10:41.680 align:start position:0%
state as an employer to kind of look
 
03:10:43.750 --> 03:10:43.760 align:start position:0%
beyond that without a series of invasive
 
03:10:46.469 --> 03:10:46.479 align:start position:0%
personal questions that would lead to
 
03:10:48.309 --> 03:10:48.319 align:start position:0%
challenge charges of discrimination
 
03:10:50.790 --> 03:10:50.800 align:start position:0%
based upon a person's gender identity so
 
03:10:52.950 --> 03:10:52.960 align:start position:0%
it's unclear exactly practically how
 
03:10:55.670 --> 03:10:55.680 align:start position:0%
this effect really plays out
 
03:10:58.309 --> 03:10:58.319 align:start position:0%
a second set of issues could arise under
 
03:11:02.229 --> 03:11:02.239 align:start position:0%
federal law in 2020 as attorney hyatt
 
03:11:04.870 --> 03:11:04.880 align:start position:0%
described the u.s supreme court issued a
 
03:11:06.630 --> 03:11:06.640 align:start position:0%
decision in a case called bostick versus
 
03:11:09.590 --> 03:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
clayton county the case addressed the
 
03:11:11.750 --> 03:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
question of whether the term sex for the
 
03:11:13.349 --> 03:11:13.359 align:start position:0%
purposes of title vii which is the
 
03:11:13.359 --> 03:11:14.389 align:start position:0%
purposes of title vii which is the
federal

03:11:14.389 --> 03:11:14.399 align:start position:0%
federal
 
03:11:16.870 --> 03:11:16.880 align:start position:0%
employment discrimination laws
 
03:11:18.870 --> 03:11:18.880 align:start position:0%
includes gender identity
 
03:11:21.349 --> 03:11:21.359 align:start position:0%
a sixth to three majority concluded that
 
03:11:23.590 --> 03:11:23.600 align:start position:0%
title vii does prohibit employers from
 
03:11:25.110 --> 03:11:25.120 align:start position:0%
discriminating based upon gender
 
03:11:25.120 --> 03:11:27.830 align:start position:0%
discriminating based upon gender
identity

03:11:27.830 --> 03:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:29.269 --> 03:11:29.279 align:start position:0%
the current administration has
 
03:11:31.429 --> 03:11:31.439 align:start position:0%
considered this applicable to title ix
 
03:11:32.870 --> 03:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
as well as multiple circuit courts
 
03:11:35.429 --> 03:11:35.439 align:start position:0%
across the country have also upheld
 
03:11:37.590 --> 03:11:37.600 align:start position:0%
challenges based on gender identity
 
03:11:39.830 --> 03:11:39.840 align:start position:0%
under title ix using relying upon the
 
03:11:41.590 --> 03:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
decision in bostock
 
03:11:43.830 --> 03:11:43.840 align:start position:0%
and other anti-discrimination laws the
 
03:11:46.950 --> 03:11:46.960 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation risks exposing the
 
03:11:49.269 --> 03:11:49.279 align:start position:0%
state and the political subdivisions to
 
03:11:52.150 --> 03:11:52.160 align:start position:0%
lawsuits under federal law or brought by
 
03:11:56.070 --> 03:11:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:59.269 --> 03:11:59.279 align:start position:0%
with that i'm happy to take questions
 
03:12:01.670 --> 03:12:01.680 align:start position:0%

house bill 1180 i'm from wolfeboro the
 
03:12:38.389 --> 03:12:38.399 align:start position:0%
mother of four daughters two of whom
 
03:12:40.630 --> 03:12:40.640 align:start position:0%
are now ages 19 and 20 but they have
 
03:12:42.950 --> 03:12:42.960 align:start position:0%
experience with a transgender athlete on
 
03:12:44.950 --> 03:12:44.960 align:start position:0%
high school sports teams
 
03:12:46.710 --> 03:12:46.720 align:start position:0%
freshman year my daughter joined the
 
03:12:48.630 --> 03:12:48.640 align:start position:0%
cross country team she came home and
 
03:12:50.229 --> 03:12:50.239 align:start position:0%
told me that there was a male to female
 
03:12:52.550 --> 03:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
transgender athlete on the team
 
03:12:54.229 --> 03:12:54.239 align:start position:0%
my daughter said it wasn't fair and was
 
03:12:56.309 --> 03:12:56.319 align:start position:0%
there anything that we could do about it
 
03:12:58.550 --> 03:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
i told her if you want to make a federal
 
03:13:00.389 --> 03:13:00.399 align:start position:0%
case out of it
 
03:13:00.399 --> 03:13:01.670 align:start position:0%
case out of it
yeah

03:13:01.670 --> 03:13:01.680 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:13:03.830 --> 03:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
in retrospect i kind of wish we had
 
03:13:05.429 --> 03:13:05.439 align:start position:0%
because this is becoming a much larger
 
03:13:08.150 --> 03:13:08.160 align:start position:0%
societal issue than we ever imagined
 
03:13:10.469 --> 03:13:10.479 align:start position:0%
to clarify i have nothing but compassion
 
03:13:11.910 --> 03:13:11.920 align:start position:0%

03:13:21.349 --> 03:13:21.359 align:start position:0%
never outwardly bullied by any member of
 
03:13:23.429 --> 03:13:23.439 align:start position:0%
the teams nor did this child ever
 
03:13:25.510 --> 03:13:25.520 align:start position:0%
exhibit any negative behavior toward any
 
03:13:25.520 --> 03:13:26.550 align:start position:0%
exhibit any negative behavior toward any
teammate

03:13:26.550 --> 03:13:26.560 align:start position:0%
teammate
 
03:13:28.389 --> 03:13:28.399 align:start position:0%
what stands out to me is that although
 
03:13:30.309 --> 03:13:30.319 align:start position:0%
my daughters never felt it was fair that
 
03:13:32.309 --> 03:13:32.319 align:start position:0%
they had to compete for team positions
 
03:13:34.150 --> 03:13:34.160 align:start position:0%
with the biological male
 
03:13:35.750 --> 03:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
they do not feel comfortable speaking
 
03:13:37.269 --> 03:13:37.279 align:start position:0%
out about this issue
 
03:13:38.870 --> 03:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
one would think that my 19 year old
 
03:13:41.030 --> 03:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
division one soccer player would feel
 
03:13:42.710 --> 03:13:42.720 align:start position:0%
threatened by the possibility of a
 
03:13:44.710 --> 03:13:44.720 align:start position:0%
biological male becoming part of her
 
03:13:47.110 --> 03:13:47.120 align:start position:0%
team or having to compete against a
 
03:13:50.229 --> 03:13:50.239 align:start position:0%
biological male she's about my size
 
03:13:51.590 --> 03:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
most men
 
03:13:53.670 --> 03:13:53.680 align:start position:0%
and most women that she plays with tower
 
03:13:55.110 --> 03:13:55.120 align:start position:0%
over her
 
03:13:56.870 --> 03:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
when she trains with men she's always
 
03:13:59.030 --> 03:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
more hesitant to stop their shots than
 
03:14:01.269 --> 03:14:01.279 align:start position:0%
when she trains with women
 
03:14:03.590 --> 03:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
as their mother i believe that my
 
03:14:05.110 --> 03:14:05.120 align:start position:0%
daughters were the recipients of
 
03:14:07.349 --> 03:14:07.359 align:start position:0%
subversive bullying they knew they could
 
03:14:09.190 --> 03:14:09.200 align:start position:0%
not speak out about the inequality of
 
03:14:11.910 --> 03:14:11.920 align:start position:0%
having a biological male on their team
 
03:14:13.830 --> 03:14:13.840 align:start position:0%
this child's needs were underlying the
 
03:14:16.550 --> 03:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
essence of the meaning of the team
 
03:14:19.990 --> 03:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
as the saying goes there is no i in team
 
03:14:22.630 --> 03:14:22.640 align:start position:0%
in this situation one was found
 
03:14:25.190 --> 03:14:25.200 align:start position:0%
i believe it was an unfair situation not
 
03:14:27.830 --> 03:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
only for my daughters but also for the
 
03:14:29.750 --> 03:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
transgender child
 
03:14:31.190 --> 03:14:31.200 align:start position:0%
no one should have the focus of the
 
03:14:33.670 --> 03:14:33.680 align:start position:0%
needs of an athletic team be on that be
 
03:14:36.710 --> 03:14:36.720 align:start position:0%
based on their own personal needs
 
03:14:38.469 --> 03:14:38.479 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:14:41.750 --> 03:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much do we have questions
 
03:14:43.910 --> 03:14:43.920 align:start position:0%

being here today
 
03:14:48.309 --> 03:14:48.319 align:start position:0%
i'd like to recognize uh representative
 
03:14:53.110 --> 03:14:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:55.429 --> 03:14:55.439 align:start position:0%
the gentleman opposes the bill yeah
 
03:14:55.439 --> 03:14:57.590 align:start position:0%
the gentleman opposes the bill yeah
and

03:14:57.590 --> 03:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:14:58.950 --> 03:14:58.960 align:start position:0%
i have two minutes
 
03:15:00.630 --> 03:15:00.640 align:start position:0%
okay yes thank you i'm representative
 
03:15:02.469 --> 03:15:02.479 align:start position:0%
timothy oregon i represent
 
03:15:04.309 --> 03:15:04.319 align:start position:0%
stratfor county district six the towns
 
03:15:07.670 --> 03:15:07.680 align:start position:0%
of durham and madbury so this uh
 
03:15:10.469 --> 03:15:10.479 align:start position:0%
bills like this come by every year and
 
03:15:12.229 --> 03:15:12.239 align:start position:0%
going way back to my first term which
 
03:15:15.990 --> 03:15:16.000 align:start position:0%
was uh seven terms ago and um
 
03:15:18.309 --> 03:15:18.319 align:start position:0%
i mean the whole concept of biological
 
03:15:21.590 --> 03:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
male and female is uh
 
03:15:22.950 --> 03:15:22.960 align:start position:0%
is uh
 
03:15:25.750 --> 03:15:25.760 align:start position:0%
somewhat is severely misguided since uh
 
03:15:26.630 --> 03:15:26.640 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:15:28.229 --> 03:15:28.239 align:start position:0%
there's a lot more to your gender
 
03:15:30.710 --> 03:15:30.720 align:start position:0%
identity than uh you know
 
03:15:33.429 --> 03:15:33.439 align:start position:0%
what type of uh genitals you have or
 
03:15:35.750 --> 03:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
whether you have an x y chromosome or
 
03:15:38.790 --> 03:15:38.800 align:start position:0%
whatever and um so you know this is
 
03:15:41.110 --> 03:15:41.120 align:start position:0%
this is a very um there are some people
 
03:15:42.389 --> 03:15:42.399 align:start position:0%
who aren't
 
03:15:44.389 --> 03:15:44.399 align:start position:0%
who uh don't fit in the conventional
 
03:15:45.910 --> 03:15:45.920 align:start position:0%
categories um
 
03:15:45.920 --> 03:15:47.830 align:start position:0%
categories um
and

03:15:47.830 --> 03:15:47.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:15:49.349 --> 03:15:49.359 align:start position:0%
in terms of uh
 
03:15:51.030 --> 03:15:51.040 align:start position:0%
we brought up the uh
 
03:15:52.790 --> 03:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
the bathrooms which actually restrooms
 
03:15:54.469 --> 03:15:54.479 align:start position:0%
in the bill you're actually free to use
 
03:15:57.190 --> 03:15:57.200 align:start position:0%
whichever restroom best fits uh what
 
03:15:59.190 --> 03:15:59.200 align:start position:0%
your gender expression is and that's i
 
03:16:01.429 --> 03:16:01.439 align:start position:0%
see no reason to change that loss i
 
03:16:02.950 --> 03:16:02.960 align:start position:0%
hesitate to even bring up that issue
 
03:16:04.469 --> 03:16:04.479 align:start position:0%
because you might try to fix that issue
 
03:16:06.150 --> 03:16:06.160 align:start position:0%
and they'll just create more confusion
 
03:16:07.830 --> 03:16:07.840 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
03:16:09.429 --> 03:16:09.439 align:start position:0%
so a person should be able to use either
 
03:16:11.190 --> 03:16:11.200 align:start position:0%
the men's or the ladies bathroom
 
03:16:13.830 --> 03:16:13.840 align:start position:0%
depending on uh what they feel most
 
03:16:15.670 --> 03:16:15.680 align:start position:0%
comfortable with and what the other
 
03:16:16.630 --> 03:16:16.640 align:start position:0%
people in the bathroom are most
 
03:16:19.349 --> 03:16:19.359 align:start position:0%
comfortable with um you know it's
 
03:16:21.750 --> 03:16:21.760 align:start position:0%
it's you know it's illegal to harass or
 
03:16:23.830 --> 03:16:23.840 align:start position:0%
assault someone in
 
03:16:25.030 --> 03:16:25.040 align:start position:0%
in a
 
03:16:26.710 --> 03:16:26.720 align:start position:0%
restroom or any similar place of what
 
03:16:28.550 --> 03:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
they call intimate privacy regardless of
 
03:16:28.560 --> 03:16:29.349 align:start position:0%
they call intimate privacy regardless of
uh

03:16:29.349 --> 03:16:29.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:16:32.550 --> 03:16:32.560 align:start position:0%
what gender you're presenting as or what
 
03:16:34.070 --> 03:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
you know so
 
03:16:35.590 --> 03:16:35.600 align:start position:0%
there's no need to make more law there
 
03:16:38.630 --> 03:16:38.640 align:start position:0%
as for athletic competition um
 
03:16:38.640 --> 03:16:39.910 align:start position:0%
as for athletic competition um
i

03:16:39.910 --> 03:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
i
 
03:16:42.070 --> 03:16:42.080 align:start position:0%
i don't think there's been any
 
03:16:43.349 --> 03:16:43.359 align:start position:0%
case here in new hampshire high school
 
03:16:45.349 --> 03:16:45.359 align:start position:0%
inspired miss paterno said i don't know
 
03:16:48.550 --> 03:16:48.560 align:start position:0%
of any case where uh a fema a male to
 
03:16:51.590 --> 03:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
female uh transsexual has had an unfair
 
03:16:55.030 --> 03:16:55.040 align:start position:0%
advantage on their uh on their thing i'm
 
03:16:56.710 --> 03:16:56.720 align:start position:0%
certainly aware that men tend to be
 
03:16:58.550 --> 03:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
larger than women so i'm certainly aware
 
03:17:00.630 --> 03:17:00.640 align:start position:0%
of that basic biological fact there's a
 
03:17:02.550 --> 03:17:02.560 align:start position:0%
lot more than size that comes into it
 
03:17:04.469 --> 03:17:04.479 align:start position:0%
and um
 
03:17:06.309 --> 03:17:06.319 align:start position:0%
there was a case
 
03:17:08.790 --> 03:17:08.800 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire where a uh a male
 
03:17:11.110 --> 03:17:11.120 align:start position:0%
to female transsexual won the women's
 
03:17:13.590 --> 03:17:13.600 align:start position:0%
championship in division one race
 
03:17:15.670 --> 03:17:15.680 align:start position:0%
championship in one event in
 
03:17:17.910 --> 03:17:17.920 align:start position:0%
women's track and field and um you know
 
03:17:17.920 --> 03:17:19.110 align:start position:0%
women's track and field and um you know
she

03:17:19.110 --> 03:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
she
 
03:17:20.469 --> 03:17:20.479 align:start position:0%
you know she
 
03:17:23.190 --> 03:17:23.200 align:start position:0%
didn't blow away the field and in fact
 
03:17:25.269 --> 03:17:25.279 align:start position:0%
if she had entered the olympic trials
 
03:17:27.110 --> 03:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
that same year she would have uh
 
03:17:29.110 --> 03:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
finished far behind the last place
 
03:17:31.670 --> 03:17:31.680 align:start position:0%
finisher so she was uh
 
03:17:33.990 --> 03:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
what she accomplished was certainly uh
 
03:17:35.590 --> 03:17:35.600 align:start position:0%
certainly amazing it took a lot of hard
 
03:17:37.190 --> 03:17:37.200 align:start position:0%
work but she definitely did not blow
 
03:17:39.269 --> 03:17:39.279 align:start position:0%
away the field and there's um
 
03:17:41.429 --> 03:17:41.439 align:start position:0%
you know there's a really no
 
03:17:44.070 --> 03:17:44.080 align:start position:0%
no cases of really you know there are no
 
03:17:45.990 --> 03:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
cases like that i know somebody i see
 
03:17:47.190 --> 03:17:47.200 align:start position:0%
one of my colleagues is looking
 
03:17:48.710 --> 03:17:48.720 align:start position:0%
incredulous but that you know actually
 
03:17:50.790 --> 03:17:50.800 align:start position:0%
is specific cases none of them have
 
03:17:52.630 --> 03:17:52.640 align:start position:0%
really you know outclassed a transition
 
03:17:55.030 --> 03:17:55.040 align:start position:0%
they've all had
 
03:17:57.990 --> 03:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
what they call cis females who
 
03:18:00.870 --> 03:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
who can compete on the same level or or
 
03:18:04.150 --> 03:18:04.160 align:start position:0%
or higher and um also another thing is
 
03:18:05.510 --> 03:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
misconception there in sporting
 
03:18:07.269 --> 03:18:07.279 align:start position:0%
competitions those are all private
 
03:18:09.590 --> 03:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
organizations and there are many
 
03:18:13.030 --> 03:18:13.040 align:start position:0%
uh public schools that even the uh
 
03:18:16.150 --> 03:18:16.160 align:start position:0%
even the nhiaa that um that that
 
03:18:16.160 --> 03:18:17.269 align:start position:0%
even the nhiaa that um that that
regulates

03:18:17.269 --> 03:18:17.279 align:start position:0%
regulates
 
03:18:17.279 --> 03:18:18.630 align:start position:0%
regulates
uh

03:18:18.630 --> 03:18:18.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:18:20.229 --> 03:18:20.239 align:start position:0%
you know scholastic competition that's
 
03:18:21.590 --> 03:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
actually a private institution that just
 
03:18:23.590 --> 03:18:23.600 align:start position:0%
happens to have many uh public schools
 
03:18:25.190 --> 03:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
as members so like you know sporting
 
03:18:27.590 --> 03:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
competition is almost entirely
 
03:18:29.750 --> 03:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
is almost entirely a non-governmental
 
03:18:31.910 --> 03:18:31.920 align:start position:0%
activity we don't really
 
03:18:34.150 --> 03:18:34.160 align:start position:0%
have we have little of any um
 
03:18:36.389 --> 03:18:36.399 align:start position:0%
uh jurisdiction over it so can we take
 
03:18:39.110 --> 03:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
questions oh sure why not yes yeah
 
03:18:40.630 --> 03:18:40.640 align:start position:0%
whether i can answer them no that's all
 
03:18:40.640 --> 03:18:41.349 align:start position:0%
whether i can answer them no that's all
that

03:18:41.349 --> 03:18:41.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:18:43.750 --> 03:18:43.760 align:start position:0%
well we'll stipulate you you might so
 
03:18:45.110 --> 03:18:45.120 align:start position:0%

03:19:11.990 --> 03:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
members of the committee so i am a
 
03:19:13.750 --> 03:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor of this bill and i'm in
 
03:19:16.150 --> 03:19:16.160 align:start position:0%
support of it um this bill simply
 
03:19:18.710 --> 03:19:18.720 align:start position:0%
declares that the state has a an
 
03:19:21.910 --> 03:19:21.920 align:start position:0%
interest in differentiating between male
 
03:19:23.190 --> 03:19:23.200 align:start position:0%
and female
 
03:19:26.070 --> 03:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
it allows school districts to have
 
03:19:28.630 --> 03:19:28.640 align:start position:0%
female and male only team
 
03:19:31.349 --> 03:19:31.359 align:start position:0%
sports teams if they choose
 
03:19:33.510 --> 03:19:33.520 align:start position:0%
it allows local control
 
03:19:35.349 --> 03:19:35.359 align:start position:0%
it allows the department of corrections
 
03:19:38.070 --> 03:19:38.080 align:start position:0%
to continue considering placement of
 
03:19:41.750 --> 03:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
inmates on a case-by-case basis
 
03:19:43.670 --> 03:19:43.680 align:start position:0%
so they can decide the appropriateness
 
03:19:46.630 --> 03:19:46.640 align:start position:0%
of a placement of an inmate and the
 
03:19:49.190 --> 03:19:49.200 align:start position:0%
schools could have policies where they
 
03:19:52.389 --> 03:19:52.399 align:start position:0%
take into account a number of
 
03:19:55.750 --> 03:19:55.760 align:start position:0%
criteria that helps them decide how long
 
03:19:58.070 --> 03:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
has the student been
 
03:20:00.790 --> 03:20:00.800 align:start position:0%
in transition or has
 
03:20:04.229 --> 03:20:04.239 align:start position:0%
been fully identifying as transgendered
 
03:20:05.349 --> 03:20:05.359 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:20:07.910 --> 03:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
is there any history
 
03:20:11.110 --> 03:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
that would make it a concern for that
 
03:20:12.469 --> 03:20:12.479 align:start position:0%
person to be
 
03:20:14.630 --> 03:20:14.640 align:start position:0%
in a locker room
 
03:20:17.429 --> 03:20:17.439 align:start position:0%
with biological females it could be done
 
03:20:19.349 --> 03:20:19.359 align:start position:0%
on a case-by-case basis it doesn't mean
 
03:20:21.349 --> 03:20:21.359 align:start position:0%
that the school could just you know shut
 
03:20:24.389 --> 03:20:24.399 align:start position:0%
the door completely on all transgender
 
03:20:27.750 --> 03:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
females participating in
 
03:20:29.110 --> 03:20:29.120 align:start position:0%
sports teams
 
03:20:30.309 --> 03:20:30.319 align:start position:0%
and the same with the department of
 
03:20:32.070 --> 03:20:32.080 align:start position:0%
corrections they can continue
 
03:20:34.150 --> 03:20:34.160 align:start position:0%
to do this on a case-by-case basis they
 
03:20:34.160 --> 03:20:35.830 align:start position:0%
to do this on a case-by-case basis they
can

03:20:35.830 --> 03:20:35.840 align:start position:0%
can
 
03:20:38.469 --> 03:20:38.479 align:start position:0%
it doesn't speak to determining
 
03:20:41.349 --> 03:20:41.359 align:start position:0%
sex so the schools the the prisons the
 
03:20:42.950 --> 03:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
jails they already have information on
 
03:20:45.990 --> 03:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
what the biological sex of a person is
 
03:20:48.150 --> 03:20:48.160 align:start position:0%
and as far as for sports it's written on
 
03:20:50.309 --> 03:20:50.319 align:start position:0%
a health form and if a school district
 
03:20:53.110 --> 03:20:53.120 align:start position:0%
decides to differentiate teams
 
03:20:55.429 --> 03:20:55.439 align:start position:0%
and someone lies on the form they may be
 
03:20:58.309 --> 03:20:58.319 align:start position:0%
disqualified then from participating in
 
03:21:01.670 --> 03:21:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:02.710 --> 03:21:02.720 align:start position:0%
to the
 
03:21:04.870 --> 03:21:04.880 align:start position:0%
topic of intersex individuals it's it's
 
03:21:07.910 --> 03:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
very rare but of course they are a small
 
03:21:09.590 --> 03:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
subset of society
 
03:21:11.429 --> 03:21:11.439 align:start position:0%
they are not covered under this law as i
 
03:21:12.710 --> 03:21:12.720 align:start position:0%
see it
 
03:21:15.190 --> 03:21:15.200 align:start position:0%
under this bill
 
03:21:16.950 --> 03:21:16.960 align:start position:0%
it just doesn't apply if they're not
 
03:21:20.790 --> 03:21:20.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:24.389 --> 03:21:24.399 align:start position:0%
so they can't really be differentiated
 
03:21:26.389 --> 03:21:26.399 align:start position:0%
this this bill is about balancing rights
 
03:21:28.630 --> 03:21:28.640 align:start position:0%
so we're in a really weird
 
03:21:30.790 --> 03:21:30.800 align:start position:0%
um extreme
 
03:21:33.670 --> 03:21:33.680 align:start position:0%
pendulum swing right now where
 
03:21:37.910 --> 03:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
the fighting for rights for the lgbtq
 
03:21:40.469 --> 03:21:40.479 align:start position:0%
community and fighting for trans rights
 
03:21:43.030 --> 03:21:43.040 align:start position:0%
is now conflicting with fighting for
 
03:21:45.269 --> 03:21:45.279 align:start position:0%
um women's rights and there's like i
 
03:21:46.630 --> 03:21:46.640 align:start position:0%
mean there are videos all over the
 
03:21:49.269 --> 03:21:49.279 align:start position:0%
internet of the the fight between
 
03:21:51.510 --> 03:21:51.520 align:start position:0%
the feminists and the transgender
 
03:21:51.520 --> 03:21:52.469 align:start position:0%
the feminists and the transgender
activists

03:21:52.469 --> 03:21:52.479 align:start position:0%
activists
 
03:21:54.309 --> 03:21:54.319 align:start position:0%
right so it's
 
03:21:57.590 --> 03:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
it's an odd position to be in but there
 
03:21:59.349 --> 03:21:59.359 align:start position:0%
are competing rights here
 
03:22:01.590 --> 03:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
and it's not an attack on transgender
 
03:22:01.600 --> 03:22:02.710 align:start position:0%
and it's not an attack on transgender
people

03:22:02.710 --> 03:22:02.720 align:start position:0%
people
 
03:22:05.670 --> 03:22:05.680 align:start position:0%
it's just an attempt
 
03:22:08.550 --> 03:22:08.560 align:start position:0%
to balance those rights and and give the
 
03:22:12.389 --> 03:22:12.399 align:start position:0%
state the ability to differentiate
 
03:22:13.990 --> 03:22:14.000 align:start position:0%
and then
 
03:22:15.750 --> 03:22:15.760 align:start position:0%
you know take appropriate action and it
 
03:22:17.590 --> 03:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
can be done on a case-by-case basis
 
03:22:19.750 --> 03:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in here that forces
 
03:22:22.389 --> 03:22:22.399 align:start position:0%
us to extinguish transgender people
 
03:22:24.150 --> 03:22:24.160 align:start position:0%
okay it's just
 
03:22:25.670 --> 03:22:25.680 align:start position:0%
allowing the state
 
03:22:27.190 --> 03:22:27.200 align:start position:0%
that purview
 
03:22:30.229 --> 03:22:30.239 align:start position:0%
and and the subdivisions of the state
 
03:22:31.990 --> 03:22:32.000 align:start position:0%
that purview
 
03:22:34.550 --> 03:22:34.560 align:start position:0%
to take a look at these situations
 
03:22:35.670 --> 03:22:35.680 align:start position:0%
and acknowledge that there are
 
03:22:35.680 --> 03:22:37.190 align:start position:0%
and acknowledge that there are
differences

03:22:37.190 --> 03:22:37.200 align:start position:0%
differences
 
03:22:38.870 --> 03:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative

so i'm bringing you hb 1347.
 
03:32:17.510 --> 03:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
um this bill
 
03:32:19.830 --> 03:32:19.840 align:start position:0%
speaks to competition
 
03:32:19.840 --> 03:32:20.630 align:start position:0%
speaks to competition
uh

03:32:20.630 --> 03:32:20.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:32:23.429 --> 03:32:23.439 align:start position:0%
there was some cross over between this
 
03:32:26.389 --> 03:32:26.399 align:start position:0%
bill and representative mark mclean's
 
03:32:28.389 --> 03:32:28.399 align:start position:0%
bill i wasn't sure if he was going to
 
03:32:30.630 --> 03:32:30.640 align:start position:0%
file his bill again this year
 
03:32:32.469 --> 03:32:32.479 align:start position:0%
uh so i
 
03:32:34.950 --> 03:32:34.960 align:start position:0%
he did it's hb 1044 and we had a hearing
 
03:32:37.269 --> 03:32:37.279 align:start position:0%
for that several weeks ago but so i
 
03:32:40.150 --> 03:32:40.160 align:start position:0%
submitted mine with a twist and
 
03:32:42.790 --> 03:32:42.800 align:start position:0%
by making it a membership based
 
03:32:45.670 --> 03:32:45.680 align:start position:0%
exemption from some regulations on
 
03:32:48.830 --> 03:32:48.840 align:start position:0%
healthcare facilities licensure
 
03:32:51.349 --> 03:32:51.359 align:start position:0%
um after submitting the bill i learned
 
03:32:53.190 --> 03:32:53.200 align:start position:0%
that there are some other barriers that
 
03:32:54.870 --> 03:32:54.880 align:start position:0%
need to be eliminated in order to really
 
03:32:56.309 --> 03:32:56.319 align:start position:0%
do what i was intending to do with the
 
03:32:56.319 --> 03:32:57.190 align:start position:0%
do what i was intending to do with the
bill

03:32:57.190 --> 03:32:57.200 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:32:59.349 --> 03:32:59.359 align:start position:0%
and i will address those um
 
03:33:01.510 --> 03:33:01.520 align:start position:0%
later in my in my introduction of the
 
03:33:01.520 --> 03:33:02.950 align:start position:0%
later in my in my introduction of the
bill

03:33:02.950 --> 03:33:02.960 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:33:05.590 --> 03:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
competition works and consumers deserve
 
03:33:10.229 --> 03:33:10.239 align:start position:0%
options employees also deserve options
 
03:33:10.239 --> 03:33:11.429 align:start position:0%
options employees also deserve options
um

03:33:11.429 --> 03:33:11.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:33:13.910 --> 03:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
in an article in forbes recently
 
03:33:16.229 --> 03:33:16.239 align:start position:0%
it was said show me a health care sector
 
03:33:18.229 --> 03:33:18.239 align:start position:0%
where there is no medicare no blue cross
 
03:33:19.910 --> 03:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
and no employer and i bet that's a
 
03:33:21.990 --> 03:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
market that works very well
 
03:33:24.950 --> 03:33:24.960 align:start position:0%
lasik eye surgery is one example
 
03:33:26.630 --> 03:33:26.640 align:start position:0%
the surgery center of oklahoma is
 
03:33:28.229 --> 03:33:28.239 align:start position:0%
another example
 
03:33:30.229 --> 03:33:30.239 align:start position:0%
it's a low-cost efficient health care
 
03:33:30.239 --> 03:33:31.510 align:start position:0%
it's a low-cost efficient health care
option

03:33:31.510 --> 03:33:31.520 align:start position:0%
option
 
03:33:33.349 --> 03:33:33.359 align:start position:0%
delivered in a manner that cuts red tape
 
03:33:35.670 --> 03:33:35.680 align:start position:0%
and overhead
 
03:33:37.429 --> 03:33:37.439 align:start position:0%
can benefit people with insurance and
 
03:33:40.389 --> 03:33:40.399 align:start position:0%
people without for example an acl repair
 
03:33:42.550 --> 03:33:42.560 align:start position:0%
at the oklahoma surgery center is priced
 
03:33:44.550 --> 03:33:44.560 align:start position:0%
hundred and
 
03:33:46.630 --> 03:33:46.640 align:start position:0%
ninety dollars for someone with a high
 
03:33:48.630 --> 03:33:48.640 align:start position:0%
deductible insurance plan if that cost
 
03:33:50.469 --> 03:33:50.479 align:start position:0%
doesn't reach the deductible they may
 
03:33:52.630 --> 03:33:52.640 align:start position:0%
choose to go that route and pay for the
 
03:33:54.229 --> 03:33:54.239 align:start position:0%
procedure in cash or with funds from
 
03:33:55.910 --> 03:33:55.920 align:start position:0%
their health savings account if they
 
03:33:58.070 --> 03:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
have one
 
03:34:00.469 --> 03:34:00.479 align:start position:0%
this bill comes because insurance is a
 
03:34:02.469 --> 03:34:02.479 align:start position:0%
racket is a racket
 
03:34:04.070 --> 03:34:04.080 align:start position:0%
there are limited providers it's a
 
03:34:06.070 --> 03:34:06.080 align:start position:0%
highly restricted market with little
 
03:34:08.229 --> 03:34:08.239 align:start position:0%
ability for entrepreneurs to come in and
 
03:34:10.550 --> 03:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
offer a better product
 
03:34:12.550 --> 03:34:12.560 align:start position:0%
besides those on medicaid do you know
 
03:34:14.950 --> 03:34:14.960 align:start position:0%
anyone who loves their insurance
 
03:34:16.389 --> 03:34:16.399 align:start position:0%
most people i know wonder why they're
 
03:34:17.910 --> 03:34:17.920 align:start position:0%
paying hundreds of dollars per month for
 
03:34:18.870 --> 03:34:18.880 align:start position:0%
insurance because they have high
 
03:34:21.349 --> 03:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
deductibles co-pays restricted places
 
03:34:22.950 --> 03:34:22.960 align:start position:0%
that it's honored and it has limited
 
03:34:22.960 --> 03:34:24.630 align:start position:0%
that it's honored and it has limited
coverage

03:34:24.630 --> 03:34:24.640 align:start position:0%
coverage
 
03:34:26.950 --> 03:34:26.960 align:start position:0%
what insurance does is sell access to
 
03:34:30.630 --> 03:34:30.640 align:start position:0%
pricing and makes the price the product
 
03:34:32.630 --> 03:34:32.640 align:start position:0%
care should be the product that allows
 
03:34:35.110 --> 03:34:35.120 align:start position:0%
for providers to compete by offering the
 
03:34:37.830 --> 03:34:37.840 align:start position:0%
best care at the best price
 
03:34:39.910 --> 03:34:39.920 align:start position:0%
right now many providers are limited by
 
03:34:41.429 --> 03:34:41.439 align:start position:0%
the insurance companies as to what kind
 
03:34:43.349 --> 03:34:43.359 align:start position:0%
of care they can provide and how much
 
03:34:46.070 --> 03:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
they can charge for it 15 minutes for a
 
03:34:48.950 --> 03:34:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:50.870 --> 03:34:50.880 align:start position:0%
so our providers often don't even put
 
03:34:53.030 --> 03:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
their hands on patients anymore
 
03:34:56.150 --> 03:34:56.160 align:start position:0%
our head to toe assessment is gone
 
03:34:57.670 --> 03:34:57.680 align:start position:0%
the health insurance industry has
 
03:34:59.269 --> 03:34:59.279 align:start position:0%
resulted in more compartmentalized
 
03:35:01.510 --> 03:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
health care more algorithm-based health
 
03:35:03.590 --> 03:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
care less critical thinking and
 
03:35:05.830 --> 03:35:05.840 align:start position:0%
innovation by providers and it has not
 
03:35:08.229 --> 03:35:08.239 align:start position:0%
reduced the costs of health care
 
03:35:10.630 --> 03:35:10.640 align:start position:0%
the free market medical association
 
03:35:12.790 --> 03:35:12.800 align:start position:0%
says that by selling access to a
 
03:35:14.469 --> 03:35:14.479 align:start position:0%
discount or price it is highly
 
03:35:16.710 --> 03:35:16.720 align:start position:0%
beneficial to the establishment if the
 
03:35:18.710 --> 03:35:18.720 align:start position:0%
charges are excessive
 
03:35:21.030 --> 03:35:21.040 align:start position:0%
percentage-based payment models incent
 
03:35:23.269 --> 03:35:23.279 align:start position:0%
price gouging and pricing games
 
03:35:25.269 --> 03:35:25.279 align:start position:0%
selling access to a discount where you
 
03:35:27.590 --> 03:35:27.600 align:start position:0%
benefit from the price being high puts
 
03:35:29.429 --> 03:35:29.439 align:start position:0%
you at odds with the best interests of
 
03:35:33.030 --> 03:35:33.040 align:start position:0%
the buyers and sellers of health care
 
03:35:35.030 --> 03:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
believe it or not i used to be a
 
03:35:38.150 --> 03:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
democrat a progressive liberal in fact
 
03:35:40.710 --> 03:35:40.720 align:start position:0%
until i began to have a grasp among
 
03:35:43.190 --> 03:35:43.200 align:start position:0%
other things of economics and the way
 
03:35:45.269 --> 03:35:45.279 align:start position:0%
that markets work
 
03:35:46.870 --> 03:35:46.880 align:start position:0%
the healthcare market in new hampshire
 
03:35:49.349 --> 03:35:49.359 align:start position:0%
desperately needs competition we need
 
03:35:51.750 --> 03:35:51.760 align:start position:0%
new options these large health care
 
03:35:53.510 --> 03:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
organizations have brought up the small
 
03:35:55.429 --> 03:35:55.439 align:start position:0%
practices have bought up the small
 
03:35:55.439 --> 03:35:56.710 align:start position:0%
practices have bought up the small
practices

03:35:56.710 --> 03:35:56.720 align:start position:0%
practices
 
03:35:58.550 --> 03:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
most primary care physicians and
 
03:36:00.229 --> 03:36:00.239 align:start position:0%
specialists work for large hospital
 
03:36:00.239 --> 03:36:01.349 align:start position:0%
specialists work for large hospital
systems

03:36:01.349 --> 03:36:01.359 align:start position:0%
systems
 
03:36:03.670 --> 03:36:03.680 align:start position:0%
which operate pretty autocratically
 
03:36:06.550 --> 03:36:06.560 align:start position:0%
they limit options for treatment
 
03:36:08.389 --> 03:36:08.399 align:start position:0%
never has the need for alternative
 
03:36:11.030 --> 03:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
options been more clear than since the
 
03:36:13.510 --> 03:36:13.520 align:start position:0%
beginning of the covet 19 pandemic
 
03:36:15.510 --> 03:36:15.520 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic physicians would not
 
03:36:15.520 --> 03:36:16.710 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic physicians would not
prescribe

03:36:16.710 --> 03:36:16.720 align:start position:0%
prescribe
 
03:36:18.630 --> 03:36:18.640 align:start position:0%
any treatments for kova 19 in the
 
03:36:21.030 --> 03:36:21.040 align:start position:0%
pre-acute stages of the disease because
 
03:36:23.110 --> 03:36:23.120 align:start position:0%
the hospital systems they worked for
 
03:36:25.510 --> 03:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
wouldn't let them
 
03:36:27.750 --> 03:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
now we have a cms vaccine mandate for
 
03:36:29.429 --> 03:36:29.439 align:start position:0%
health care workers that has resulted in
 
03:36:31.110 --> 03:36:31.120 align:start position:0%
hundreds of nurses and other health care
 
03:36:31.120 --> 03:36:32.870 align:start position:0%
hundreds of nurses and other health care
professionals

03:36:32.870 --> 03:36:32.880 align:start position:0%
professionals
 
03:36:35.349 --> 03:36:35.359 align:start position:0%
leaving their jobs leaving the field or
 
03:36:36.950 --> 03:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
moving to states like florida where
 
03:36:38.389 --> 03:36:38.399 align:start position:0%
they're protected
 
03:36:40.389 --> 03:36:40.399 align:start position:0%
this bill allows new facilities to be
 
03:36:42.229 --> 03:36:42.239 align:start position:0%
open that are not subject to the cms
 
03:36:43.670 --> 03:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
mandate because right now in new
 
03:36:46.150 --> 03:36:46.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire they all are
 
03:36:47.910 --> 03:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
there is no place for these health work
 
03:36:49.990 --> 03:36:50.000 align:start position:0%
health care workers to go if they have a
 
03:36:52.150 --> 03:36:52.160 align:start position:0%
philosophical or scientific objection to
 
03:36:54.469 --> 03:36:54.479 align:start position:0%
getting a covet vaccine or if they don't
 
03:36:57.590 --> 03:36:57.600 align:start position:0%
know how to pass the rigorous test of
 
03:37:03.349 --> 03:37:03.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:05.110 --> 03:37:05.120 align:start position:0%
um i'll preface the next portion of my
 
03:37:06.710 --> 03:37:06.720 align:start position:0%
speech to say that i'm open to
 
03:37:08.950 --> 03:37:08.960 align:start position:0%
amendments this committee does excellent
 
03:37:08.960 --> 03:37:10.229 align:start position:0%
amendments this committee does excellent
work

03:37:10.229 --> 03:37:10.239 align:start position:0%
work
 
03:37:11.910 --> 03:37:11.920 align:start position:0%
so there's plenty of room to work
 
03:37:13.429 --> 03:37:13.439 align:start position:0%
together on this
 
03:37:15.510 --> 03:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
this bill is a little bit different from
 
03:37:17.590 --> 03:37:17.600 align:start position:0%

03:37:21.190 --> 03:37:21.200 align:start position:0%
mine contains contains the same same
 
03:37:22.630 --> 03:37:22.640 align:start position:0%
byte with a little bit of conflicting
 
03:37:24.150 --> 03:37:24.160 align:start position:0%
language in the area of statute that
 
03:37:26.550 --> 03:37:26.560 align:start position:0%
they both amend which was which is rsa
 
03:37:29.190 --> 03:37:29.200 align:start position:0%
151 2 f
 
03:37:31.670 --> 03:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
where hb 1044 says direct payment mine
 
03:37:33.590 --> 03:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
says membership-based business so we
 
03:37:34.710 --> 03:37:34.720 align:start position:0%
will need to think about that and
 
03:37:36.630 --> 03:37:36.640 align:start position:0%
possibly amend it
 
03:37:38.229 --> 03:37:38.239 align:start position:0%
what does the committee think you know
 
03:37:40.790 --> 03:37:40.800 align:start position:0%
we're legislators we're elected by our
 
03:37:43.110 --> 03:37:43.120 align:start position:0%
um constituents to make good decisions
 
03:37:45.269 --> 03:37:45.279 align:start position:0%
so what would be the best way to move
 
03:37:48.550 --> 03:37:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:50.389 --> 03:37:50.399 align:start position:0%
there is some suggested language in the
 
03:37:52.150 --> 03:37:52.160 align:start position:0%
draft amendment that i passed around
 
03:37:53.830 --> 03:37:53.840 align:start position:0%
that you should all have
 
03:37:55.510 --> 03:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
and if anyone doesn't have one let me
 
03:37:57.349 --> 03:37:57.359 align:start position:0%
know we'll get you one
 
03:38:00.790 --> 03:38:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:02.150 --> 03:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
yeah it
 
03:38:03.590 --> 03:38:03.600 align:start position:0%
i think it's on the right corner of your
 
03:38:12.790 --> 03:38:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:15.830 --> 03:38:15.840 align:start position:0%
i believe the way that h you're welcome
 
03:38:18.309 --> 03:38:18.319 align:start position:0%
i believe that the way that hb 1044 is
 
03:38:20.309 --> 03:38:20.319 align:start position:0%
currently written eliminates sections a
 
03:38:23.830 --> 03:38:23.840 align:start position:0%
b c and d under rsa 151 2 f
 
03:38:25.429 --> 03:38:25.439 align:start position:0%
my bill doesn't
 
03:38:27.670 --> 03:38:27.680 align:start position:0%
seek to repeal those sections it only
 
03:38:30.550 --> 03:38:30.560 align:start position:0%
allows for an exemption to a and b
 
03:38:33.429 --> 03:38:33.439 align:start position:0%
so you'll see in the original hb 1347 in
 
03:38:35.590 --> 03:38:35.600 align:start position:0%
section one paragraph two
 
03:38:38.150 --> 03:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
it says section one a and b shall not
 
03:38:39.830 --> 03:38:39.840 align:start position:0%
apply to facilities that operate on a
 
03:38:41.429 --> 03:38:41.439 align:start position:0%
membership-based business model so this
 
03:38:43.349 --> 03:38:43.359 align:start position:0%
means that these facilities would not be
 
03:38:45.189 --> 03:38:45.199 align:start position:0%
inhibited by the requirement to accept
 
03:38:47.349 --> 03:38:47.359 align:start position:0%
all forms of payment nor be required to
 
03:38:49.030 --> 03:38:49.040 align:start position:0%
institute an assistance plan for those
 
03:38:50.790 --> 03:38:50.800 align:start position:0%
without insurance
 
03:38:52.309 --> 03:38:52.319 align:start position:0%
however they would not be exempt from
 
03:38:54.150 --> 03:38:54.160 align:start position:0%
providing data to the department or
 
03:38:57.189 --> 03:38:57.199 align:start position:0%
paying fees for licensure
 
03:38:58.790 --> 03:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
the third piece of the bill is to permit
 
03:39:00.389 --> 03:39:00.399 align:start position:0%
these facilities to have an emergency
 
03:39:02.150 --> 03:39:02.160 align:start position:0%
room that is not open to anyone
 
03:39:04.229 --> 03:39:04.239 align:start position:0%
regardless of ability to pay and which
 
03:39:06.550 --> 03:39:06.560 align:start position:0%
is not required to operate 24 7
 
03:39:08.550 --> 03:39:08.560 align:start position:0%
permitted that they make that abundantly
 
03:39:10.710 --> 03:39:10.720 align:start position:0%
clear on their signage it's an obvious
 
03:39:12.309 --> 03:39:12.319 align:start position:0%
burden that conflicts with the intent of
 
03:39:14.070 --> 03:39:14.080 align:start position:0%
what the bill seeks to do to require
 
03:39:15.830 --> 03:39:15.840 align:start position:0%
them to take
 
03:39:15.840 --> 03:39:16.710 align:start position:0%
them to take
um

03:39:16.710 --> 03:39:16.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:39:18.950 --> 03:39:18.960 align:start position:0%
patients that pay for pay for their
 
03:39:20.870 --> 03:39:20.880 align:start position:0%
services with insurance
 
03:39:22.710 --> 03:39:22.720 align:start position:0%
this section does not exempt facilities
 
03:39:25.030 --> 03:39:25.040 align:start position:0%
from emtala requirements under federal
 
03:39:25.040 --> 03:39:26.630 align:start position:0%
from emtala requirements under federal
law

03:39:26.630 --> 03:39:26.640 align:start position:0%
law
 
03:39:28.229 --> 03:39:28.239 align:start position:0%
which is that they must assess and
 
03:39:29.830 --> 03:39:29.840 align:start position:0%
stabilize someone if they show up in
 
03:39:31.590 --> 03:39:31.600 align:start position:0%
need of emergency services while they're
 
03:39:34.070 --> 03:39:34.080 align:start position:0%
open regardless of payment so in those
 
03:39:36.070 --> 03:39:36.080 align:start position:0%
dire circumstances if the emergency room
 
03:39:38.229 --> 03:39:38.239 align:start position:0%
is open and someone comes in bleeding
 
03:39:39.750 --> 03:39:39.760 align:start position:0%
from a gunshot wound they sustained
 
03:39:41.429 --> 03:39:41.439 align:start position:0%
while walking through the parking lot
 
03:39:43.429 --> 03:39:43.439 align:start position:0%
but are not members
 
03:39:45.349 --> 03:39:45.359 align:start position:0%
or rely on insurance they won't be left
 
03:39:47.510 --> 03:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
to bleed and die there is still an oath
 
03:39:49.670 --> 03:39:49.680 align:start position:0%
that physicians take a code of ethics
 
03:39:51.269 --> 03:39:51.279 align:start position:0%
they operate under
 
03:39:53.590 --> 03:39:53.600 align:start position:0%
and federal law requires patients be
 
03:39:55.110 --> 03:39:55.120 align:start position:0%
assessed and stabilized before being
 
03:39:56.950 --> 03:39:56.960 align:start position:0%
sent elsewhere and again if we need
 
03:39:59.110 --> 03:39:59.120 align:start position:0%
language to clarify that and to clarify
 
03:40:00.790 --> 03:40:00.800 align:start position:0%
when the edu is open and when it is not
 
03:40:02.790 --> 03:40:02.800 align:start position:0%
we can do that
 
03:40:04.070 --> 03:40:04.080 align:start position:0%
those are the three pieces that i was
 
03:40:05.429 --> 03:40:05.439 align:start position:0%
seeking to have done with the original
 
03:40:07.269 --> 03:40:07.279 align:start position:0%
bill however there are two sections in
 
03:40:09.349 --> 03:40:09.359 align:start position:0%
the draft amendment that i have
 
03:40:11.030 --> 03:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
that are necessary to free up this in
 
03:40:11.040 --> 03:40:12.229 align:start position:0%
that are necessary to free up this in
industry

03:40:12.229 --> 03:40:12.239 align:start position:0%
industry
 
03:40:13.510 --> 03:40:13.520 align:start position:0%
and i would have included them in the
 
03:40:15.110 --> 03:40:15.120 align:start position:0%
original bill if i could go back in time
 
03:40:17.590 --> 03:40:17.600 align:start position:0%
and i knew about these issues they were
 
03:40:19.670 --> 03:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
brought to my attention by the josiah
 
03:40:23.590 --> 03:40:23.600 align:start position:0%
bartlett society center for policy and i
 
03:40:25.830 --> 03:40:25.840 align:start position:0%
did pass out a handout
 
03:40:27.510 --> 03:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
where they talk about that and i do
 
03:40:30.870 --> 03:40:30.880 align:start position:0%
agree with that organization sometimes
 
03:40:30.880 --> 03:40:32.630 align:start position:0%
agree with that organization sometimes
um

03:40:32.630 --> 03:40:32.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:40:33.990 --> 03:40:34.000 align:start position:0%
the statutes that govern these
 
03:40:35.750 --> 03:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
facilities and their licensure are
 
03:40:37.830 --> 03:40:37.840 align:start position:0%
complex and convoluted so it's hard to
 
03:40:37.840 --> 03:40:39.030 align:start position:0%
complex and convoluted so it's hard to
find

03:40:39.030 --> 03:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
find
 
03:40:39.040 --> 03:40:40.469 align:start position:0%
find
where

03:40:40.469 --> 03:40:40.479 align:start position:0%
where
 
03:40:42.309 --> 03:40:42.319 align:start position:0%
the regulations need to be pulled off to
 
03:40:44.469 --> 03:40:44.479 align:start position:0%
open up this market so if you take a
 
03:40:45.990 --> 03:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
look at the amendment language i passed
 
03:40:47.590 --> 03:40:47.600 align:start position:0%
out you'll see in section one that it
 
03:40:49.110 --> 03:40:49.120 align:start position:0%
seeks to exempt these facilities from
 
03:40:51.110 --> 03:40:51.120 align:start position:0%
the moratorium on the licensing of new
 
03:40:53.189 --> 03:40:53.199 align:start position:0%
facilities without doing this the bill
 
03:40:54.550 --> 03:40:54.560 align:start position:0%
really is pretty much meeting
 
03:40:56.309 --> 03:40:56.319 align:start position:0%
meaningless as how can alternative
 
03:40:57.349 --> 03:40:57.359 align:start position:0%
options spring up if there's a
 
03:41:01.110 --> 03:41:01.120 align:start position:0%
moratorium on new facilities licensure
 
03:41:04.950 --> 03:41:04.960 align:start position:0%
this piece is integral to hp 1044 and hb
 
03:41:07.110 --> 03:41:07.120 align:start position:0%
1347 in my opinion
 
03:41:09.510 --> 03:41:09.520 align:start position:0%
next in section 4 of the draft amendment
 
03:41:11.189 --> 03:41:11.199 align:start position:0%
is language to exempt these facilities
 
03:41:12.469 --> 03:41:12.479 align:start position:0%
from being prohibited from opening
 
03:41:14.710 --> 03:41:14.720 align:start position:0%
within a 15 mile radius of a critical
 
03:41:16.469 --> 03:41:16.479 align:start position:0%
access hospital which i also believe is
 
03:41:18.389 --> 03:41:18.399 align:start position:0%
necessary for this bill to have its
 
03:41:19.990 --> 03:41:20.000 align:start position:0%
desired effect of allowing market
 
03:41:21.910 --> 03:41:21.920 align:start position:0%
competition in the acute and sub-acute
 
03:41:24.790 --> 03:41:24.800 align:start position:0%
healthcare industry of new hampshire
 
03:41:26.309 --> 03:41:26.319 align:start position:0%
so really i just want to open this
 
03:41:28.630 --> 03:41:28.640 align:start position:0%
market up we need to allow alternative
 
03:41:31.110 --> 03:41:31.120 align:start position:0%
options for health care to
 
03:41:33.910 --> 03:41:33.920 align:start position:0%
be created and these regulations that
 
03:41:35.750 --> 03:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
are in place are the remainder of the
 
03:41:38.550 --> 03:41:38.560 align:start position:0%
certificate of need
 
03:41:40.469 --> 03:41:40.479 align:start position:0%
board that used to exist in new
 
03:41:42.870 --> 03:41:42.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire and these were the changes
 
03:41:42.880 --> 03:41:44.229 align:start position:0%
hampshire and these were the changes
that

03:41:44.229 --> 03:41:44.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:41:46.790 --> 03:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
kind of were left as that negotiation
 
03:41:48.630 --> 03:41:48.640 align:start position:0%
through the legislature
 
03:41:48.640 --> 03:41:49.510 align:start position:0%
through the legislature
and

03:41:49.510 --> 03:41:49.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:41:51.590 --> 03:41:51.600 align:start position:0%
they're still having a harmful impact on
 
03:41:53.670 --> 03:41:53.680 align:start position:0%
our health care system and they just
 
03:41:55.429 --> 03:41:55.439 align:start position:0%
need to be
 
03:41:57.510 --> 03:41:57.520 align:start position:0%
they need to be worked out so that we
 
03:41:59.830 --> 03:41:59.840 align:start position:0%
can open this market up for patients and
 
03:41:59.840 --> 03:42:01.110 align:start position:0%
can open this market up for patients and
employees

03:42:01.110 --> 03:42:01.120 align:start position:0%
employees
 
03:42:03.990 --> 03:42:04.000 align:start position:0%
will you take questions yes i will
 
03:42:06.070 --> 03:42:06.080 align:start position:0%
representative canarch
 
03:42:08.229 --> 03:42:08.239 align:start position:0%
thanks i am just a little bit confused
 
03:42:09.590 --> 03:42:09.600 align:start position:0%
on the
 
03:42:11.429 --> 03:42:11.439 align:start position:0%
because you were running through the
 
03:42:13.030 --> 03:42:13.040 align:start position:0%
draft amendment which seems like you
 
03:42:14.150 --> 03:42:14.160 align:start position:0%
sort of want to replace the bill with
 
03:42:16.309 --> 03:42:16.319 align:start position:0%
that much faster than the rest of it the
 
03:42:18.309 --> 03:42:18.319 align:start position:0%
the and i reviewed the other so question
 
03:42:20.630 --> 03:42:20.640 align:start position:0%
in terms of the special facilities
 
03:42:23.670 --> 03:42:23.680 align:start position:0%
within a 15 mile radius where is that in
 
03:42:24.870 --> 03:42:24.880 align:start position:0%
your um
 
03:42:29.510 --> 03:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
draft amendment sure that is section
 
03:42:29.520 --> 03:42:32.870 align:start position:0%
draft amendment sure that is section
one

03:42:32.870 --> 03:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:35.030 --> 03:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
um sorry is that it no that's the
 
03:42:38.469 --> 03:42:38.479 align:start position:0%
moratorium sex section
 
03:42:40.550 --> 03:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
oh thank you yes
 
03:42:41.990 --> 03:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
section four
 
03:42:44.790 --> 03:42:44.800 align:start position:0%
roman reigns oh yeah i'm sorry
 
03:42:47.830 --> 03:42:47.840 align:start position:0%
okay so follow up please follow up
 
03:42:49.349 --> 03:42:49.359 align:start position:0%
um i would have to ask you the same
 
03:42:51.269 --> 03:42:51.279 align:start position:0%
question i asked um
 
03:42:54.469 --> 03:42:54.479 align:start position:0%
when 1044 was presented
 
03:42:57.110 --> 03:42:57.120 align:start position:0%
so if we're going to then allow a
 
03:42:57.120 --> 03:42:58.710 align:start position:0%
so if we're going to then allow a
standalone

03:42:58.710 --> 03:42:58.720 align:start position:0%
standalone
 
03:43:01.189 --> 03:43:01.199 align:start position:0%
emergency room this present open only on
 
03:43:03.510 --> 03:43:03.520 align:start position:0%
certain hours not open all the time that
 
03:43:06.389 --> 03:43:06.399 align:start position:0%
skims off the high paying customers
 
03:43:08.870 --> 03:43:08.880 align:start position:0%
uh do you have any sense of what the
 
03:43:10.630 --> 03:43:10.640 align:start position:0%
impact will be on our critical access
 
03:43:12.550 --> 03:43:12.560 align:start position:0%
hospitals that tend to run on a razor
 
03:43:14.870 --> 03:43:14.880 align:start position:0%
thin margin of about one percent
 
03:43:17.110 --> 03:43:17.120 align:start position:0%
and need to rely on a revenue payer mix
 
03:43:19.510 --> 03:43:19.520 align:start position:0%
that uh helps to reimburse because for
 
03:43:19.520 --> 03:43:20.389 align:start position:0%
that uh helps to reimburse because for
all

03:43:20.389 --> 03:43:20.399 align:start position:0%
all
 
03:43:23.510 --> 03:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
hospitals ews are lost their losses they
 
03:43:25.670 --> 03:43:25.680 align:start position:0%
don't make money on on those
 
03:43:25.680 --> 03:43:27.189 align:start position:0%
don't make money on on those
so

03:43:27.189 --> 03:43:27.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:43:29.590 --> 03:43:29.600 align:start position:0%
any sense of how that
 
03:43:32.070 --> 03:43:32.080 align:start position:0%
what impact they will be if we have a
 
03:43:34.469 --> 03:43:34.479 align:start position:0%
birthing center or an ew that opens up
 
03:43:36.630 --> 03:43:36.640 align:start position:0%
within that radius
 
03:43:39.110 --> 03:43:39.120 align:start position:0%
and how that might skim off and cause us
 
03:43:40.950 --> 03:43:40.960 align:start position:0%
to lose our critical access hospitals
 
03:43:44.070 --> 03:43:44.080 align:start position:0%
and maternity centers and ews
 
03:43:44.080 --> 03:43:45.269 align:start position:0%
and maternity centers and ews
well

03:43:45.269 --> 03:43:45.279 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:43:47.910 --> 03:43:47.920 align:start position:0%
if those hospitals can only stay
 
03:43:50.070 --> 03:43:50.080 align:start position:0%
functioning because they exclude
 
03:43:51.910 --> 03:43:51.920 align:start position:0%
competition through other business
 
03:43:51.920 --> 03:43:53.030 align:start position:0%
competition through other business
models

03:43:53.030 --> 03:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
models
 
03:43:55.429 --> 03:43:55.439 align:start position:0%
then maybe there's a serious problem
 
03:43:57.910 --> 03:43:57.920 align:start position:0%
with the models that they operate under
 
03:43:59.670 --> 03:43:59.680 align:start position:0%
well follow up then
 
03:44:01.269 --> 03:44:01.279 align:start position:0%
follow up they could post their hours
 
03:44:03.510 --> 03:44:03.520 align:start position:0%
for the emergency room yes critical
 
03:44:05.429 --> 03:44:05.439 align:start position:0%
access hospitals don't post hours saying
 
03:44:08.070 --> 03:44:08.080 align:start position:0%
we're closed between 8 p.m and 8 a.m
 
03:44:10.229 --> 03:44:10.239 align:start position:0%
they have to be open all the time right
 
03:44:11.429 --> 03:44:11.439 align:start position:0%
so wouldn't it be if you're going to
 
03:44:12.630 --> 03:44:12.640 align:start position:0%
have a different business model wouldn't
 
03:44:14.950 --> 03:44:14.960 align:start position:0%
they have to compete on the same level
 
03:44:18.710 --> 03:44:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:20.790 --> 03:44:20.800 align:start position:0%
no that's the beauty of competition is
 
03:44:23.510 --> 03:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
you can offer a different product
 
03:44:25.030 --> 03:44:25.040 align:start position:0%
and that you can offer different
 
03:44:28.150 --> 03:44:28.160 align:start position:0%
services and you know it'll appeal to
 
03:44:30.630 --> 03:44:30.640 align:start position:0%
some clients and not to others one more
 
03:44:32.070 --> 03:44:32.080 align:start position:0%
follow-up and then i'll quit
 
03:44:35.189 --> 03:44:35.199 align:start position:0%
so what does that gunshot patient do
 
03:44:38.309 --> 03:44:38.319 align:start position:0%
when they have been shot up in conway
 
03:44:41.750 --> 03:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
and memorial hospital is closed because
 
03:44:43.030 --> 03:44:43.040 align:start position:0%
i mean close because they went out of
 
03:44:44.950 --> 03:44:44.960 align:start position:0%
business because something else moved in
 
03:44:46.630 --> 03:44:46.640 align:start position:0%
close by
 
03:44:48.229 --> 03:44:48.239 align:start position:0%
what are they supposed to do just die in
 
03:44:50.309 --> 03:44:50.319 align:start position:0%
the street this isn't to say that these
 
03:44:53.269 --> 03:44:53.279 align:start position:0%
hospitals won't be 24 hours but it is a
 
03:44:55.110 --> 03:44:55.120 align:start position:0%
burden especially for these hospitals
 
03:44:58.309 --> 03:44:58.319 align:start position:0%
starting out to have to staff 24 hours
 
03:45:00.389 --> 03:45:00.399 align:start position:0%
it's just a barrier of entry
 
03:45:03.510 --> 03:45:03.520 align:start position:0%
so if there's a demand for 24-hour
 
03:45:07.030 --> 03:45:07.040 align:start position:0%
emergency room care then the supply will
 
03:45:09.189 --> 03:45:09.199 align:start position:0%
adjust to that demand that's how markets
 
03:45:09.199 --> 03:45:10.309 align:start position:0%
adjust to that demand that's how markets
work

03:45:10.309 --> 03:45:10.319 align:start position:0%
work
 
03:45:12.229 --> 03:45:12.239 align:start position:0%
the chair has a question for the
 
03:45:14.469 --> 03:45:14.479 align:start position:0%
representative would you believe and it
 
03:45:16.790 --> 03:45:16.800 align:start position:0%
is is it your experience
 
03:45:19.510 --> 03:45:19.520 align:start position:0%
the driving around we see these well
 
03:45:21.110 --> 03:45:21.120 align:start position:0%
they don't look like big hospitals
 
03:45:22.630 --> 03:45:22.640 align:start position:0%
they're pop-up emergency room and it
 
03:45:25.269 --> 03:45:25.279 align:start position:0%
gave you the hours have you seen them
 
03:45:28.309 --> 03:45:28.319 align:start position:0%
i have urgent cares are a very common
 
03:45:30.070 --> 03:45:30.080 align:start position:0%
occurrence now in new hampshire and
 
03:45:30.080 --> 03:45:31.189 align:start position:0%
occurrence now in new hampshire and
elsewhere

03:45:31.189 --> 03:45:31.199 align:start position:0%
elsewhere
 
03:45:31.199 --> 03:45:31.830 align:start position:0%
elsewhere
and

03:45:31.830 --> 03:45:31.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:45:34.150 --> 03:45:34.160 align:start position:0%
they are often 24-hour
 
03:45:36.469 --> 03:45:36.479 align:start position:0%
facilities but they're not always
 
03:45:38.309 --> 03:45:38.319 align:start position:0%
they're not always you're correct second
 
03:45:41.269 --> 03:45:41.279 align:start position:0%
question is i had a nice chat with my
 
03:45:44.309 --> 03:45:44.319 align:start position:0%
former vice chair dr marsh former member
 
03:45:45.990 --> 03:45:46.000 align:start position:0%
of this committee
 
03:45:48.070 --> 03:45:48.080 align:start position:0%
and he said as a member of the board of
 
03:45:50.229 --> 03:45:50.239 align:start position:0%
trustees of his hospital he was kind of
 
03:45:52.550 --> 03:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
worried when one of these
 
03:45:54.389 --> 03:45:54.399 align:start position:0%
urgent care facilities
 
03:45:55.910 --> 03:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
was going to open
 
03:45:58.790 --> 03:45:58.800 align:start position:0%
nearby thinking they would skim off
 
03:46:01.590 --> 03:46:01.600 align:start position:0%
all the cream and his experience as a
 
03:46:03.670 --> 03:46:03.680 align:start position:0%
member of the board of his hospital was
 
03:46:06.150 --> 03:46:06.160 align:start position:0%
they did not do that did i share that
 
03:46:07.590 --> 03:46:07.600 align:start position:0%
with you before
 
03:46:09.349 --> 03:46:09.359 align:start position:0%
you did not okay i'll share that with
 
03:46:11.750 --> 03:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
you sometime thank you representative
 
03:46:11.760 --> 03:46:17.349 align:start position:0%
you sometime thank you representative
merchant

03:46:17.349 --> 03:46:17.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:18.630 --> 03:46:18.640 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman looking forward to
 
03:46:20.070 --> 03:46:20.080 align:start position:0%
that discussion
 
03:46:22.150 --> 03:46:22.160 align:start position:0%
in regards to uh the question
 
03:46:22.160 --> 03:46:23.189 align:start position:0%

03:46:24.389 --> 03:46:24.399 align:start position:0%
cushman thank you for taking the
 
03:46:24.399 --> 03:46:25.590 align:start position:0%
cushman thank you for taking the
question

03:46:25.590 --> 03:46:25.600 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:46:27.910 --> 03:46:27.920 align:start position:0%
my concern is i don't disagree with free
 
03:46:29.429 --> 03:46:29.439 align:start position:0%
markets i think free markets have
 
03:46:30.870 --> 03:46:30.880 align:start position:0%
actually been very effective in a lot of
 
03:46:32.150 --> 03:46:32.160 align:start position:0%
ways and health care unfortunately has
 
03:46:33.349 --> 03:46:33.359 align:start position:0%
not been
 
03:46:35.590 --> 03:46:35.600 align:start position:0%
a good example of that however my
 
03:46:37.990 --> 03:46:38.000 align:start position:0%
concern fundamentally here
 
03:46:40.790 --> 03:46:40.800 align:start position:0%
is that when you look at this bill it's
 
03:46:43.429 --> 03:46:43.439 align:start position:0%
almost creating two tiers of health care
 
03:46:45.670 --> 03:46:45.680 align:start position:0%
one for those who can afford it
 
03:46:47.429 --> 03:46:47.439 align:start position:0%
and those who can't
 
03:46:49.110 --> 03:46:49.120 align:start position:0%
and i can share with you in other
 
03:46:50.950 --> 03:46:50.960 align:start position:0%
countries i've traveled through they
 
03:46:52.710 --> 03:46:52.720 align:start position:0%
tried something like this and it didn't
 
03:46:52.720 --> 03:46:54.389 align:start position:0%
tried something like this and it didn't
work

03:46:54.389 --> 03:46:54.399 align:start position:0%
work
 
03:46:55.910 --> 03:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
part of it is because you couldn't have
 
03:46:57.750 --> 03:46:57.760 align:start position:0%
a way to subsidize those who needed
 
03:47:00.150 --> 03:47:00.160 align:start position:0%
support financially from those who had
 
03:47:02.790 --> 03:47:02.800 align:start position:0%
it so how does this prevent us getting
 
03:47:04.309 --> 03:47:04.319 align:start position:0%
to a situation where we end up with a
 
03:47:07.189 --> 03:47:07.199 align:start position:0%
two-tier system in this country where
 
03:47:08.950 --> 03:47:08.960 align:start position:0%
those who have the money and have the
 
03:47:11.269 --> 03:47:11.279 align:start position:0%
assets and have the wealth get one level
 
03:47:12.550 --> 03:47:12.560 align:start position:0%
of care and everyone else gets a
 
03:47:14.229 --> 03:47:14.239 align:start position:0%
different one
 
03:47:15.110 --> 03:47:15.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
03:47:15.120 --> 03:47:16.469 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
representative

03:47:16.469 --> 03:47:16.479 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:47:18.870 --> 03:47:18.880 align:start position:0%
so i reject the premise that this would
 
03:47:22.229 --> 03:47:22.239 align:start position:0%
create a two-tiered system um
 
03:47:23.990 --> 03:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
based on the fact that
 
03:47:26.630 --> 03:47:26.640 align:start position:0%
the idea that um
 
03:47:28.309 --> 03:47:28.319 align:start position:0%
some people would be able to afford this
 
03:47:30.229 --> 03:47:30.239 align:start position:0%
and others wouldn't and that it would be
 
03:47:33.030 --> 03:47:33.040 align:start position:0%
differentiable like i know people who
 
03:47:34.870 --> 03:47:34.880 align:start position:0%
can barely afford their health insurance
 
03:47:36.309 --> 03:47:36.319 align:start position:0%
right now
 
03:47:38.469 --> 03:47:38.479 align:start position:0%
and their deductibles are so high and
 
03:47:40.469 --> 03:47:40.479 align:start position:0%
their co-pays are so high
 
03:47:41.830 --> 03:47:41.840 align:start position:0%
it's a terrible
 
03:47:45.110 --> 03:47:45.120 align:start position:0%
burden for them and it doesn't have much
 
03:47:46.870 --> 03:47:46.880 align:start position:0%
payout so
 
03:47:48.630 --> 03:47:48.640 align:start position:0%
this option would be better for them
 
03:47:51.030 --> 03:47:51.040 align:start position:0%
they're lower income people but they
 
03:47:54.150 --> 03:47:54.160 align:start position:0%
don't meet um you know the
 
03:47:56.630 --> 03:47:56.640 align:start position:0%
income limit limit for
 
03:47:59.110 --> 03:47:59.120 align:start position:0%
medicaid and they may not want state
 
03:48:01.510 --> 03:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
assistance so they want to pay for their
 
03:48:04.070 --> 03:48:04.080 align:start position:0%
own and then my second
 
03:48:04.080 --> 03:48:05.510 align:start position:0%
own and then my second
comment

03:48:05.510 --> 03:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
comment
 
03:48:06.630 --> 03:48:06.640 align:start position:0%
is that
 
03:48:09.990 --> 03:48:10.000 align:start position:0%
there's nothing preventing any charities
 
03:48:11.830 --> 03:48:11.840 align:start position:0%
from assisting with paying for
 
03:48:13.750 --> 03:48:13.760 align:start position:0%
membership costs there's nothing
 
03:48:13.760 --> 03:48:15.670 align:start position:0%
membership costs there's nothing
preventing

03:48:15.670 --> 03:48:15.680 align:start position:0%
preventing
 
03:48:18.229 --> 03:48:18.239 align:start position:0%
these hospitals from having a sliding
 
03:48:20.229 --> 03:48:20.239 align:start position:0%
scale or facilities from having a
 
03:48:22.469 --> 03:48:22.479 align:start position:0%
sliding scale for services we haven't
 
03:48:24.229 --> 03:48:24.239 align:start position:0%
even talked about what the membership
 
03:48:27.110 --> 03:48:27.120 align:start position:0%
costs are and honestly
 
03:48:28.710 --> 03:48:28.720 align:start position:0%
like if you look at the direct primary
 
03:48:31.510 --> 03:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
care model it ends up being cheaper than
 
03:48:33.269 --> 03:48:33.279 align:start position:0%
paying for insurance
 
03:48:35.670 --> 03:48:35.680 align:start position:0%
to to go with a direct primary care
 
03:48:35.680 --> 03:48:36.870 align:start position:0%
to to go with a direct primary care
physician

03:48:36.870 --> 03:48:36.880 align:start position:0%
physician
 
03:48:41.590 --> 03:48:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:44.950 --> 03:48:44.960 align:start position:0%
follow up to representative merchant
 
03:48:46.870 --> 03:48:46.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
03:48:48.790 --> 03:48:48.800 align:start position:0%
given the fact that the state of new
 
03:48:50.630 --> 03:48:50.640 align:start position:0%
hampshire actually has a very healthy
 
03:48:50.640 --> 03:48:51.670 align:start position:0%
hampshire actually has a very healthy
website

03:48:51.670 --> 03:48:51.680 align:start position:0%
website
 
03:48:54.070 --> 03:48:54.080 align:start position:0%
for people to go on and find out what
 
03:48:56.309 --> 03:48:56.319 align:start position:0%
the cost is for a procedure including
 
03:48:56.319 --> 03:48:58.070 align:start position:0%
the cost is for a procedure including
cash

03:48:58.070 --> 03:48:58.080 align:start position:0%
cash
 
03:48:59.590 --> 03:48:59.600 align:start position:0%
therefore people who have high
 
03:49:01.830 --> 03:49:01.840 align:start position:0%
deductibles can in fact shop around
 
03:49:01.840 --> 03:49:02.870 align:start position:0%
deductibles can in fact shop around
today

03:49:02.870 --> 03:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
today
 
03:49:04.710 --> 03:49:04.720 align:start position:0%
and do exactly what this bill is trying
 
03:49:08.070 --> 03:49:08.080 align:start position:0%
to do without creating another form of
 
03:49:10.870 --> 03:49:10.880 align:start position:0%
provider because if the person knows how
 
03:49:13.030 --> 03:49:13.040 align:start position:0%
to use it and most of my experiences
 
03:49:14.950 --> 03:49:14.960 align:start position:0%
most patients don't
 
03:49:16.710 --> 03:49:16.720 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be better off to educate the
 
03:49:18.630 --> 03:49:18.640 align:start position:0%
people on how to use what we have today
 
03:49:21.030 --> 03:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
to help them become educated shoppers
 
03:49:22.710 --> 03:49:22.720 align:start position:0%
when they have high deductibles to keep
 
03:49:25.670 --> 03:49:25.680 align:start position:0%
their costs down would you know that
 
03:49:25.680 --> 03:49:28.550 align:start position:0%
their costs down would you know that
well

03:49:28.550 --> 03:49:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:28.560 --> 03:49:31.429 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:49:31.429 --> 03:49:31.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:34.229 --> 03:49:34.239 align:start position:0%
sorry i'm just like trying to
 
03:49:38.469 --> 03:49:38.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:41.030 --> 03:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
if that was the only thing that the bill
 
03:49:42.630 --> 03:49:42.640 align:start position:0%
was trying to do was make
 
03:49:45.189 --> 03:49:45.199 align:start position:0%
cost transparent sure
 
03:49:45.199 --> 03:49:46.150 align:start position:0%
cost transparent sure
maybe

03:49:46.150 --> 03:49:46.160 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
03:49:49.030 --> 03:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
um but the bill's trying to
 
03:49:50.870 --> 03:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
first of all
 
03:49:52.950 --> 03:49:52.960 align:start position:0%
offer alternative options for businesses
 
03:49:54.389 --> 03:49:54.399 align:start position:0%
remove barriers of
 
03:49:55.990 --> 03:49:56.000 align:start position:0%
entry and
 
03:49:58.550 --> 03:49:58.560 align:start position:0%
encourage competition in healthcare
 
03:49:59.590 --> 03:49:59.600 align:start position:0%
those are
 
03:50:01.349 --> 03:50:01.359 align:start position:0%
that's the
 
03:50:03.750 --> 03:50:03.760 align:start position:0%
meat and potatoes right and then other
 
03:50:06.309 --> 03:50:06.319 align:start position:0%
benefits will follow that prices
 
03:50:09.590 --> 03:50:09.600 align:start position:0%
decrease as market competition increases
 
03:50:09.600 --> 03:50:10.630 align:start position:0%
decrease as market competition increases
service

03:50:10.630 --> 03:50:10.640 align:start position:0%
service
 
03:50:12.469 --> 03:50:12.479 align:start position:0%
quality increases
 
03:50:14.150 --> 03:50:14.160 align:start position:0%
value of what you're paying for
 
03:50:14.160 --> 03:50:15.510 align:start position:0%
value of what you're paying for
increases

03:50:15.510 --> 03:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
increases
 
03:50:17.349 --> 03:50:17.359 align:start position:0%
okay and then
 
03:50:18.790 --> 03:50:18.800 align:start position:0%
the other thing is
 
03:50:22.389 --> 03:50:22.399 align:start position:0%
now we can allow facilities to open up
 
03:50:24.630 --> 03:50:24.640 align:start position:0%
that do not have to comply
 
03:50:28.389 --> 03:50:28.399 align:start position:0%
with federal cms regulations
 
03:50:30.870 --> 03:50:30.880 align:start position:0%
which has had a terribly negative impact
 
03:50:33.750 --> 03:50:33.760 align:start position:0%
on staffing and moral
 
03:50:33.760 --> 03:50:35.110 align:start position:0%
on staffing and moral
distress

03:50:35.110 --> 03:50:35.120 align:start position:0%
distress
 
03:50:36.469 --> 03:50:36.479 align:start position:0%
in our health care system in new
 
03:50:39.110 --> 03:50:39.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire and elsewhere
 
03:50:39.120 --> 03:50:41.990 align:start position:0%
hampshire and elsewhere
additionally

03:50:41.990 --> 03:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:42.000 --> 03:50:43.990 align:start position:0%
 
more

03:50:43.990 --> 03:50:44.000 align:start position:0%
more
 
03:50:44.000 --> 03:50:45.030 align:start position:0%
more
the

03:50:45.030 --> 03:50:45.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:50:49.590 --> 03:50:49.600 align:start position:0%
paying for the service and the care
 
03:50:51.750 --> 03:50:51.760 align:start position:0%
helps make it makes sure that the care
 
03:50:53.830 --> 03:50:53.840 align:start position:0%
is the product right when you're paying
 
03:50:56.389 --> 03:50:56.399 align:start position:0%
for access to discounts
 
03:51:00.630 --> 03:51:00.640 align:start position:0%
it incentivizes the base price of health
 
03:51:03.670 --> 03:51:03.680 align:start position:0%
care services to be higher so that you
 
03:51:03.680 --> 03:51:04.710 align:start position:0%
care services to be higher so that you
can

03:51:04.710 --> 03:51:04.720 align:start position:0%
can
 
03:51:07.189 --> 03:51:07.199 align:start position:0%
wiggle and adjust the discounts and make
 
03:51:09.990 --> 03:51:10.000 align:start position:0%
the market the discounts meaning what
 
03:51:12.309 --> 03:51:12.319 align:start position:0%
the insurance will pay and reimburse
 
03:51:14.830 --> 03:51:14.840 align:start position:0%
right and then the consumer it's just
 
03:51:17.670 --> 03:51:17.680 align:start position:0%
convoluted this is more straightforward
 
03:51:19.590 --> 03:51:19.600 align:start position:0%
allows the product here's the product
 
03:51:21.750 --> 03:51:21.760 align:start position:0%
you pay for it
 
03:51:24.790 --> 03:51:24.800 align:start position:0%
we will be uh putting this hearing into
 
03:51:28.309 --> 03:51:28.319 align:start position:0%
i hope the correct term is recess
 
03:51:30.150 --> 03:51:30.160 align:start position:0%
so we'll have recess during the lunch
 
03:51:31.990 --> 03:51:32.000 align:start position:0%
hour and come back and we've got
 
03:51:33.990 --> 03:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
questions from different people and a
 
03:51:36.389 --> 03:51:36.399 align:start position:0%
guest appearance of paula minihan we'll
 
04:32:42.229 --> 04:32:42.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:45.030 --> 04:32:45.040 align:start position:0%
resume the hearing on what we were doing
 
04:32:47.469 --> 04:32:47.479 align:start position:0%
before we stopped uh
 
04:32:51.030 --> 04:32:51.040 align:start position:0%
1347 relative to licensing requirements
 
04:32:53.670 --> 04:32:53.680 align:start position:0%
for health care facilities that operate
 
04:32:56.630 --> 04:32:56.640 align:start position:0%
on a membership-based business model
 
04:32:58.870 --> 04:32:58.880 align:start position:0%
representative cushman has been
 
04:33:00.870 --> 04:33:00.880 align:start position:0%
presenting her bill
 
04:33:03.429 --> 04:33:03.439 align:start position:0%
and is in the process of taking
 
04:33:05.429 --> 04:33:05.439 align:start position:0%
questions the chair recognizes
 
04:33:08.390 --> 04:33:08.400 align:start position:0%
representative cannon
 
04:33:09.990 --> 04:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
04:33:12.150 --> 04:33:12.160 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
04:33:14.150 --> 04:33:14.160 align:start position:0%
do we have any sort of idea as far as
 
04:33:14.160 --> 04:33:14.869 align:start position:0%
do we have any sort of idea as far as
the

04:33:14.869 --> 04:33:14.879 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:33:14.879 --> 04:33:15.590 align:start position:0%
the
mag

04:33:15.590 --> 04:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
mag
 
04:33:18.869 --> 04:33:18.879 align:start position:0%
magnitude of the cost that someone would
 
04:33:21.990 --> 04:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
uh have to put out to join this
 
04:33:24.551 --> 04:33:24.561 align:start position:0%
members only to join yeah
 
04:33:25.830 --> 04:33:25.840 align:start position:0%
well for
 
04:33:28.310 --> 04:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
i i don't know what it would be to join
 
04:33:30.310 --> 04:33:30.320 align:start position:0%
you know that the market would would
 
04:33:32.629 --> 04:33:32.639 align:start position:0%
decide that so
 
04:33:33.670 --> 04:33:33.680 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:33:36.070 --> 04:33:36.080 align:start position:0%
a reasonable cost is whatever the
 
04:33:38.789 --> 04:33:38.799 align:start position:0%
consumer and the provider of a good or
 
04:33:38.799 --> 04:33:40.070 align:start position:0%
consumer and the provider of a good or
service

04:33:40.070 --> 04:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
service
 
04:33:41.510 --> 04:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
agree upon
 
04:33:41.520 --> 04:33:42.470 align:start position:0%
agree upon
so

04:33:42.470 --> 04:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:33:44.949 --> 04:33:44.959 align:start position:0%
you know that it could be
 
04:33:47.269 --> 04:33:47.279 align:start position:0%
so what for example direct primary care
 
04:33:50.230 --> 04:33:50.240 align:start position:0%
practices they charge about 200 a month
 
04:33:51.510 --> 04:33:51.520 align:start position:0%
some are a little more expensive some
 
04:33:54.150 --> 04:33:54.160 align:start position:0%
are a little less um the one that i am a
 
04:33:56.551 --> 04:33:56.561 align:start position:0%
member of they cover
 
04:33:59.750 --> 04:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
um 12 sick visits a year
 
04:33:59.760 --> 04:34:00.629 align:start position:0%
um 12 sick visits a year
and

04:34:00.629 --> 04:34:00.639 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:34:02.709 --> 04:34:02.719 align:start position:0%
and that's for a family of five
 
04:34:04.949 --> 04:34:04.959 align:start position:0%
225 dollars a month for my family of
 
04:34:07.109 --> 04:34:07.119 align:start position:0%
five 12 six visits for every family
 
04:34:08.789 --> 04:34:08.799 align:start position:0%
member per year
 
04:34:11.750 --> 04:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
i know some that are cheaper
 
04:34:13.670 --> 04:34:13.680 align:start position:0%
and i know some that are more expensive
 
04:34:13.680 --> 04:34:15.109 align:start position:0%
and i know some that are more expensive
and

04:34:15.109 --> 04:34:15.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:34:18.629 --> 04:34:18.639 align:start position:0%
i know multiple that offer sliding scale
 
04:34:20.470 --> 04:34:20.480 align:start position:0%
so it depends
 
04:34:22.070 --> 04:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
um but i could see
 
04:34:24.551 --> 04:34:24.561 align:start position:0%
you know that that's affordable for us
 
04:34:26.629 --> 04:34:26.639 align:start position:0%
you know and i could see that being
 
04:34:28.949 --> 04:34:28.959 align:start position:0%
extrapolated in a similar circumstance
 
04:34:30.551 --> 04:34:30.561 align:start position:0%
where you don't have that
 
04:34:32.949 --> 04:34:32.959 align:start position:0%
regulatory burden you don't have to meet
 
04:34:35.189 --> 04:34:35.199 align:start position:0%
the insurance costs which can be up to
 
04:34:37.109 --> 04:34:37.119 align:start position:0%
you know the administrative costs of
 
04:34:39.189 --> 04:34:39.199 align:start position:0%
processing insurance claims which can be
 
04:34:42.709 --> 04:34:42.719 align:start position:0%
35 percent of your total costs to the
 
04:34:42.719 --> 04:34:44.070 align:start position:0%
35 percent of your total costs to the
business

04:34:44.070 --> 04:34:44.080 align:start position:0%
business
 
04:34:46.470 --> 04:34:46.480 align:start position:0%
so it i mean
 
04:34:48.709 --> 04:34:48.719 align:start position:0%
i foresee that it would be
 
04:34:52.789 --> 04:34:52.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:54.629 --> 04:34:54.639 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro
 
04:34:56.310 --> 04:34:56.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
04:34:56.320 --> 04:34:57.670 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
um

04:34:57.670 --> 04:34:57.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:35:01.029 --> 04:35:01.039 align:start position:0%
having served on a similar
 
04:35:03.269 --> 04:35:03.279 align:start position:0%
work group with representative knurk
 
04:35:05.670 --> 04:35:05.680 align:start position:0%
about critical care hospitals
 
04:35:05.680 --> 04:35:06.551 align:start position:0%
about critical care hospitals
i

04:35:06.551 --> 04:35:06.561 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:35:08.070 --> 04:35:08.080 align:start position:0%
didn't really know anything about them
 
04:35:09.830 --> 04:35:09.840 align:start position:0%
but i learned a little bit about their
 
04:35:13.910 --> 04:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:16.310 --> 04:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
during that work group and
 
04:35:18.869 --> 04:35:18.879 align:start position:0%
so to go back and to piggyback on his
 
04:35:20.830 --> 04:35:20.840 align:start position:0%
question about
 
04:35:24.070 --> 04:35:24.080 align:start position:0%
um if one of these facilities was to
 
04:35:26.869 --> 04:35:26.879 align:start position:0%
open within 15 miles i'm not sure why 15
 
04:35:32.310 --> 04:35:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:34.949 --> 04:35:34.959 align:start position:0%
arbitrary but um if it was open to open
 
04:35:38.551 --> 04:35:38.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:40.551 --> 04:35:40.561 align:start position:0%
did make the difference between a
 
04:35:43.269 --> 04:35:43.279 align:start position:0%
hospital being able to stay in business
 
04:35:45.349 --> 04:35:45.359 align:start position:0%
or not stay in business and there's no
 
04:35:46.869 --> 04:35:46.879 align:start position:0%
telling that that would happen but if
 
04:35:48.551 --> 04:35:48.561 align:start position:0%
that was the case or
 
04:35:50.470 --> 04:35:50.480 align:start position:0%
if in the case that it had a close down
 
04:35:52.551 --> 04:35:52.561 align:start position:0%
a labor and delivery
 
04:35:54.629 --> 04:35:54.639 align:start position:0%
service because those are the
 
04:35:56.150 --> 04:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
those are we learned that that was one
 
04:35:57.830 --> 04:35:57.840 align:start position:0%
of the most vulnerable services for
 
04:36:02.310 --> 04:36:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:04.869 --> 04:36:04.879 align:start position:0%
so if a hospital was to close or if the
 
04:36:06.390 --> 04:36:06.400 align:start position:0%
labor and delivery
 
04:36:10.629 --> 04:36:10.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:13.510 --> 04:36:13.520 align:start position:0%
would people who lived in that area who
 
04:36:15.429 --> 04:36:15.439 align:start position:0%
perhaps had medicaid or even private
 
04:36:18.230 --> 04:36:18.240 align:start position:0%
insurances or was uninsured would they
 
04:36:20.390 --> 04:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
be able to get their care
 
04:36:23.510 --> 04:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
at these new facilities
 
04:36:26.310 --> 04:36:26.320 align:start position:0%
or would they be excluded because
 
04:36:29.750 --> 04:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
they don't take any kind of insurance
 
04:36:31.349 --> 04:36:31.359 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
04:36:34.310 --> 04:36:34.320 align:start position:0%
um so it'll be up to
 
04:36:37.029 --> 04:36:37.039 align:start position:0%
these entrepreneurs who start a new
 
04:36:38.551 --> 04:36:38.561 align:start position:0%
business whether
 
04:36:40.470 --> 04:36:40.480 align:start position:0%
they have the option
 
04:36:41.429 --> 04:36:41.439 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:36:41.439 --> 04:36:42.230 align:start position:0%
you know
by

04:36:42.230 --> 04:36:42.240 align:start position:0%
by
 
04:36:44.470 --> 04:36:44.480 align:start position:0%
amending the law as written in the in
 
04:36:47.109 --> 04:36:47.119 align:start position:0%
the bill in the proposed amendment
 
04:36:49.029 --> 04:36:49.039 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say that they can't accept
 
04:36:50.709 --> 04:36:50.719 align:start position:0%
insurance maybe they'll take some of
 
04:36:52.629 --> 04:36:52.639 align:start position:0%
them it just says they can't take all
 
04:36:55.349 --> 04:36:55.359 align:start position:0%
payers so but it really depends i mean
 
04:36:55.359 --> 04:36:56.551 align:start position:0%
payers so but it really depends i mean
if

04:36:56.551 --> 04:36:56.561 align:start position:0%
if
 
04:36:58.949 --> 04:36:58.959 align:start position:0%
if there are insured people and they
 
04:37:00.709 --> 04:37:00.719 align:start position:0%
don't have
 
04:37:02.629 --> 04:37:02.639 align:start position:0%
an option
 
04:37:05.750 --> 04:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
to find the care they're looking for
 
04:37:09.670 --> 04:37:09.680 align:start position:0%
because uh maternity ward closed
 
04:37:09.680 --> 04:37:11.510 align:start position:0%
because uh maternity ward closed
um

04:37:11.510 --> 04:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:37:14.150 --> 04:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
and i'll come back to that thought too
 
04:37:14.160 --> 04:37:15.910 align:start position:0%
and i'll come back to that thought too
um

04:37:15.910 --> 04:37:15.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:37:18.869 --> 04:37:18.879 align:start position:0%
you know then there's a i'm a need in
 
04:37:21.109 --> 04:37:21.119 align:start position:0%
the market there's a demand so that's a
 
04:37:23.349 --> 04:37:23.359 align:start position:0%
place where entrepreneurs step in but
 
04:37:24.869 --> 04:37:24.879 align:start position:0%
none of this happens overnight like
 
04:37:24.879 --> 04:37:25.670 align:start position:0%
none of this happens overnight like
these

04:37:25.670 --> 04:37:25.680 align:start position:0%
these
 
04:37:28.390 --> 04:37:28.400 align:start position:0%
you know business doesn't spring up you
 
04:37:29.990 --> 04:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
know the next day there's a huge
 
04:37:31.349 --> 04:37:31.359 align:start position:0%
competitor and
 
04:37:34.070 --> 04:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
um it's going to take out the hospitals
 
04:37:36.150 --> 04:37:36.160 align:start position:0%
i mean there there would be some time to
 
04:37:36.160 --> 04:37:37.910 align:start position:0%
i mean there there would be some time to
adjust

04:37:37.910 --> 04:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
adjust
 
04:37:40.310 --> 04:37:40.320 align:start position:0%
to the market you know ebbs and flows of
 
04:37:41.590 --> 04:37:41.600 align:start position:0%
what's going on the operation of the
 
04:37:44.070 --> 04:37:44.080 align:start position:0%
hospital i think that they would look at
 
04:37:45.349 --> 04:37:45.359 align:start position:0%
you know maybe
 
04:37:49.349 --> 04:37:49.359 align:start position:0%
if a hospital was in financial crisis
 
04:37:51.830 --> 04:37:51.840 align:start position:0%
they would look at what they can do
 
04:37:54.551 --> 04:37:54.561 align:start position:0%
besides closing wards i believe before
 
04:37:56.470 --> 04:37:56.480 align:start position:0%
they would look at you know doing that
 
04:37:58.230 --> 04:37:58.240 align:start position:0%
if that they're the only ones in the
 
04:38:00.869 --> 04:38:00.879 align:start position:0%
area especially
 
04:38:03.029 --> 04:38:03.039 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up
 
04:38:05.189 --> 04:38:05.199 align:start position:0%
so um that's good to know that they
 
04:38:07.750 --> 04:38:07.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't necessarily exclude taking
 
04:38:09.510 --> 04:38:09.520 align:start position:0%
insurances it wouldn't be
 
04:38:12.070 --> 04:38:12.080 align:start position:0%
cash only
 
04:38:12.080 --> 04:38:13.029 align:start position:0%
cash only
so

04:38:13.029 --> 04:38:13.039 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:38:15.990 --> 04:38:16.000 align:start position:0%
given that they're a private
 
04:38:17.990 --> 04:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
business they could they could make the
 
04:38:20.310 --> 04:38:20.320 align:start position:0%
choice whether to take insurance as well
 
04:38:20.320 --> 04:38:21.429 align:start position:0%
choice whether to take insurance as well
right

04:38:21.429 --> 04:38:21.439 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:38:23.910 --> 04:38:23.920 align:start position:0%
but they would would they be excluded
 
04:38:26.070 --> 04:38:26.080 align:start position:0%
from having to have a
 
04:38:26.080 --> 04:38:27.269 align:start position:0%
from having to have a
uh

04:38:27.269 --> 04:38:27.279 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:38:29.269 --> 04:38:29.279 align:start position:0%
whatever it's called charity care or
 
04:38:33.429 --> 04:38:33.439 align:start position:0%
free care policy like hospitals
 
04:38:33.439 --> 04:38:34.709 align:start position:0%
free care policy like hospitals
sorry

04:38:34.709 --> 04:38:34.719 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
04:38:36.629 --> 04:38:36.639 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i'm sorry for
 
04:38:39.109 --> 04:38:39.119 align:start position:0%
uh cutting you off that's all right um
 
04:38:41.109 --> 04:38:41.119 align:start position:0%
they are not excluded from they're not
 
04:38:43.109 --> 04:38:43.119 align:start position:0%
prohibited from it they're just not
 
04:38:43.119 --> 04:38:44.709 align:start position:0%
prohibited from it they're just not
required

04:38:44.709 --> 04:38:44.719 align:start position:0%
required
 
04:38:44.719 --> 04:38:45.910 align:start position:0%
required
but

04:38:45.910 --> 04:38:45.920 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:38:48.789 --> 04:38:48.799 align:start position:0%
okay so they're not required like like
 
04:38:50.830 --> 04:38:50.840 align:start position:0%
hospitals are currently
 
04:38:55.830 --> 04:38:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:58.230 --> 04:38:58.240 align:start position:0%
representative folsom thank you chairman
 
04:39:00.230 --> 04:39:00.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question this is
 
04:39:02.070 --> 04:39:02.080 align:start position:0%
a relatively
 
04:39:05.029 --> 04:39:05.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:08.070 --> 04:39:08.080 align:start position:0%
and so we don't have statistics on on
 
04:39:11.189 --> 04:39:11.199 align:start position:0%
this but um is there a somewhat of a
 
04:39:13.910 --> 04:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
consensus among the people who are
 
04:39:16.070 --> 04:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
are looking into this option
 
04:39:18.709 --> 04:39:18.719 align:start position:0%
as to what percentage of patients would
 
04:39:21.590 --> 04:39:21.600 align:start position:0%
we be drawing away from a traditional
 
04:39:21.600 --> 04:39:22.789 align:start position:0%
we be drawing away from a traditional
hospital

04:39:22.789 --> 04:39:22.799 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
04:39:25.269 --> 04:39:25.279 align:start position:0%
is this a large percentage of people or
 
04:39:27.670 --> 04:39:27.680 align:start position:0%
small will you know
 
04:39:30.150 --> 04:39:30.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
04:39:31.349 --> 04:39:31.359 align:start position:0%
i could
 
04:39:33.189 --> 04:39:33.199 align:start position:0%
i don't think that there's
 
04:39:35.990 --> 04:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
any data on it but
 
04:39:37.670 --> 04:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
as far as direct primary care it's like
 
04:39:39.750 --> 04:39:39.760 align:start position:0%
a very very very small
 
04:39:42.708 --> 04:39:42.718 align:start position:0%
number uh a small percentage of the
 
04:39:45.910 --> 04:39:45.920 align:start position:0%
healthcare consumer market
 
04:39:48.470 --> 04:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
i don't foresee right now
 
04:39:50.868 --> 04:39:50.878 align:start position:0%
the way it would work right is right now
 
04:39:54.070 --> 04:39:54.080 align:start position:0%
most people have commercial insurance or
 
04:39:54.080 --> 04:39:55.110 align:start position:0%
most people have commercial insurance or
um

04:39:55.110 --> 04:39:55.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:39:58.948 --> 04:39:58.958 align:start position:0%
you know they have state insurance
 
04:40:03.430 --> 04:40:03.440 align:start position:0%
very small number of people don't have
 
04:40:05.030 --> 04:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
one of one of those
 
04:40:05.040 --> 04:40:06.390 align:start position:0%
one of one of those
and

04:40:06.390 --> 04:40:06.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:40:08.310 --> 04:40:08.320 align:start position:0%
this would be a great option for them
 
04:40:10.070 --> 04:40:10.080 align:start position:0%
and it would be a great option for some
 
04:40:12.310 --> 04:40:12.320 align:start position:0%
people who have insurance but maybe it's
 
04:40:14.310 --> 04:40:14.320 align:start position:0%
not a great plan
 
04:40:18.150 --> 04:40:18.160 align:start position:0%
so they're not having the needs met
 
04:40:19.990 --> 04:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
through that
 
04:40:23.030 --> 04:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
um but i don't see it being at least at
 
04:40:23.040 --> 04:40:24.310 align:start position:0%
um but i don't see it being at least at
first

04:40:24.310 --> 04:40:24.320 align:start position:0%
first
 
04:40:26.868 --> 04:40:26.878 align:start position:0%
being a big portion of the population
 
04:40:29.190 --> 04:40:29.200 align:start position:0%
but if it starts to work
 
04:40:31.270 --> 04:40:31.280 align:start position:0%
and people see that it's attractive and
 
04:40:32.708 --> 04:40:32.718 align:start position:0%
that it's a better product and it's a
 
04:40:35.030 --> 04:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
better way of doing it it could expand
 
04:40:39.670 --> 04:40:39.680 align:start position:0%
but markets are kind of slow to respond
 
04:40:41.750 --> 04:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
so it wouldn't again happen overnight
 
04:40:43.270 --> 04:40:43.280 align:start position:0%
this wouldn't be pulling out the rug
 
04:40:45.190 --> 04:40:45.200 align:start position:0%
from every comp you know
 
04:40:47.750 --> 04:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
insurance honoring
 
04:40:49.670 --> 04:40:49.680 align:start position:0%
and required
 
04:40:52.550 --> 04:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
health care facility
 
04:40:56.310 --> 04:40:56.320 align:start position:0%
representative do you think that as a
 
04:40:58.310 --> 04:40:58.320 align:start position:0%
few of these hospitals get going and
 
04:41:01.030 --> 04:41:01.040 align:start position:0%
they proved to be popular existing
 
04:41:03.670 --> 04:41:03.680 align:start position:0%
facilities may think how can we
 
04:41:05.830 --> 04:41:05.840 align:start position:0%
incorporate some of that
 
04:41:07.990 --> 04:41:08.000 align:start position:0%
looks like a good idea and it might keep
 
04:41:11.270 --> 04:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
some of our patients from wandering off
 
04:41:12.788 --> 04:41:12.798 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
04:41:16.230 --> 04:41:16.240 align:start position:0%
yeah i depending on how we frame this
 
04:41:18.470 --> 04:41:18.480 align:start position:0%
if we leave it open to them having a
 
04:41:18.480 --> 04:41:20.390 align:start position:0%
if we leave it open to them having a
membership

04:41:20.390 --> 04:41:20.400 align:start position:0%
membership
 
04:41:20.400 --> 04:41:21.190 align:start position:0%
membership
and

04:41:21.190 --> 04:41:21.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:41:23.190 --> 04:41:23.200 align:start position:0%
thereby being exempt from taking all
 
04:41:26.150 --> 04:41:26.160 align:start position:0%
payers and if they see that they can not
 
04:41:27.990 --> 04:41:28.000 align:start position:0%
only accommodate people who
 
04:41:29.190 --> 04:41:29.200 align:start position:0%
who have
 
04:41:31.670 --> 04:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
inadequate coverage or no health health
 
04:41:33.190 --> 04:41:33.200 align:start position:0%
care coverage
 
04:41:35.670 --> 04:41:35.680 align:start position:0%
but also incorporate some of this model
 
04:41:38.708 --> 04:41:38.718 align:start position:0%
and accepting um
 
04:41:41.350 --> 04:41:41.360 align:start position:0%
you know cash payment yeah it could be
 
04:41:44.310 --> 04:41:44.320 align:start position:0%
broadened thank you representative knurk
 
04:41:46.310 --> 04:41:46.320 align:start position:0%
thank you very much um if we look back
 
04:41:48.550 --> 04:41:48.560 align:start position:0%
at the historical issue that for example
 
04:41:51.350 --> 04:41:51.360 align:start position:0%
prior to medicare the great majority of
 
04:41:53.510 --> 04:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
older adults were not
 
04:41:55.670 --> 04:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
covered with insurance because the free
 
04:41:57.510 --> 04:41:57.520 align:start position:0%
market says it's not worth it to take
 
04:41:59.590 --> 04:41:59.600 align:start position:0%
care of expensive old people
 
04:42:01.910 --> 04:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
because you can't afford them
 
04:42:04.070 --> 04:42:04.080 align:start position:0%
so i'm curious what entrepreneur you're
 
04:42:05.590 --> 04:42:05.600 align:start position:0%
going to find that somebody opens a
 
04:42:07.030 --> 04:42:07.040 align:start position:0%
birthing center that's private
 
04:42:09.670 --> 04:42:09.680 align:start position:0%
membership and it draws the
 
04:42:11.590 --> 04:42:11.600 align:start position:0%
high-paying customers away
 
04:42:12.868 --> 04:42:12.878 align:start position:0%
and now that you're left with the
 
04:42:12.878 --> 04:42:13.910 align:start position:0%
and now that you're left with the
medicaid

04:42:13.910 --> 04:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
medicaid
 
04:42:15.910 --> 04:42:15.920 align:start position:0%
patients uh which is actually about 60
 
04:42:17.590 --> 04:42:17.600 align:start position:0%
of births what entrepreneur in their
 
04:42:19.430 --> 04:42:19.440 align:start position:0%
right mind is going to open up a
 
04:42:21.190 --> 04:42:21.200 align:start position:0%
birthing center to deal with that
 
04:42:23.750 --> 04:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
particular population to make money and
 
04:42:28.788 --> 04:42:28.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:28.798 --> 04:42:30.390 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:42:30.390 --> 04:42:30.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:42:31.910 --> 04:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
can you say can you frame the question
 
04:42:33.110 --> 04:42:33.120 align:start position:0%
again well you keep talking about the
 
04:42:34.550 --> 04:42:34.560 align:start position:0%
free market will rise we said what
 
04:42:36.070 --> 04:42:36.080 align:start position:0%
happened i think representative shapiro
 
04:42:38.150 --> 04:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
said if you if we pull away people and
 
04:42:40.310 --> 04:42:40.320 align:start position:0%
this so this they lose the maternity
 
04:42:41.670 --> 04:42:41.680 align:start position:0%
service out of a hospital you said well
 
04:42:43.990 --> 04:42:44.000 align:start position:0%
the free market rise to do it
 
04:42:46.310 --> 04:42:46.320 align:start position:0%
what entrepreneur in their right mind
 
04:42:49.430 --> 04:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
would rise to try to start a birthing
 
04:42:52.150 --> 04:42:52.160 align:start position:0%
center to deal with people a group of
 
04:42:55.750 --> 04:42:55.760 align:start position:0%
people who cannot pay their costs
 
04:42:57.670 --> 04:42:57.680 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
04:43:00.788 --> 04:43:00.798 align:start position:0%
i i can't foresee what
 
04:43:02.788 --> 04:43:02.798 align:start position:0%
what ways you know people will come up
 
04:43:05.030 --> 04:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
with solutions to these problems but i
 
04:43:06.550 --> 04:43:06.560 align:start position:0%
mean physicians
 
04:43:08.550 --> 04:43:08.560 align:start position:0%
set out to help people
 
04:43:11.910 --> 04:43:11.920 align:start position:0%
and groups of physicians often do have
 
04:43:11.920 --> 04:43:13.430 align:start position:0%
and groups of physicians often do have
charity

04:43:13.430 --> 04:43:13.440 align:start position:0%
charity
 
04:43:15.270 --> 04:43:15.280 align:start position:0%
portions of their business
 
04:43:17.830 --> 04:43:17.840 align:start position:0%
so i i think that the need will be met
 
04:43:20.550 --> 04:43:20.560 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether it's through
 
04:43:22.310 --> 04:43:22.320 align:start position:0%
accepting reimbursement from medicare or
 
04:43:24.230 --> 04:43:24.240 align:start position:0%
medicaid or
 
04:43:25.510 --> 04:43:25.520 align:start position:0%
you know if they decide to have a
 
04:43:26.948 --> 04:43:26.958 align:start position:0%
sliding scale
 
04:43:28.550 --> 04:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
they can these businesses can
 
04:43:31.430 --> 04:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
accommodate people
 
04:43:31.440 --> 04:43:34.708 align:start position:0%
accommodate people
follow-up

04:43:34.708 --> 04:43:34.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:36.708 --> 04:43:36.718 align:start position:0%
mike mike i thought you didn't hit it
 
04:43:38.390 --> 04:43:38.400 align:start position:0%
that's what our hospitals currently do
 
04:43:40.150 --> 04:43:40.160 align:start position:0%
they do have
 
04:43:42.150 --> 04:43:42.160 align:start position:0%
take all-comers and they have to
 
04:43:42.160 --> 04:43:43.430 align:start position:0%
take all-comers and they have to
unfortunately

04:43:43.430 --> 04:43:43.440 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
04:43:45.190 --> 04:43:45.200 align:start position:0%
subsidize the places that lose money
 
04:43:47.670 --> 04:43:47.680 align:start position:0%
like ews and maternities with the other
 
04:43:47.680 --> 04:43:48.868 align:start position:0%
like ews and maternities with the other
payers

04:43:48.868 --> 04:43:48.878 align:start position:0%
payers
 
04:43:52.948 --> 04:43:52.958 align:start position:0%
and so the issue is when you lose those
 
04:43:54.390 --> 04:43:54.400 align:start position:0%
they already are doing that how are they
 
04:43:56.150 --> 04:43:56.160 align:start position:0%
going to manage to make that into a
 
04:43:57.590 --> 04:43:57.600 align:start position:0%
business that actually allows them to
 
04:43:59.110 --> 04:43:59.120 align:start position:0%
have a profit margin that's in the black
 
04:44:00.390 --> 04:44:00.400 align:start position:0%
not in the red they're right now running
 
04:44:01.750 --> 04:44:01.760 align:start position:0%
about one percent margins in our
 
04:44:03.670 --> 04:44:03.680 align:start position:0%
critical access hospitals
 
04:44:06.628 --> 04:44:06.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:09.030 --> 04:44:09.040 align:start position:0%
so you're you're asking
 
04:44:11.030 --> 04:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
about the existing
 
04:44:13.430 --> 04:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
hospitals not new entrepreneurs starting
 
04:44:15.590 --> 04:44:15.600 align:start position:0%
new businesses well
 
04:44:17.350 --> 04:44:17.360 align:start position:0%
if i may respond it could be either one
 
04:44:18.628 --> 04:44:18.638 align:start position:0%
also again
 
04:44:20.708 --> 04:44:20.718 align:start position:0%
who's going to be able to suddenly
 
04:44:22.550 --> 04:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
figure out how to make money on medicaid
 
04:44:23.910 --> 04:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
reimbursement that doesn't pay their
 
04:44:23.920 --> 04:44:26.948 align:start position:0%
reimbursement that doesn't pay their
costs

04:44:26.948 --> 04:44:26.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:28.550 --> 04:44:28.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
04:44:30.628 --> 04:44:30.638 align:start position:0%
i think you're just identifying you know
 
04:44:32.868 --> 04:44:32.878 align:start position:0%
existing problems with our system it
 
04:44:35.590 --> 04:44:35.600 align:start position:0%
already is put putting this pressure
 
04:44:36.708 --> 04:44:36.718 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:44:39.830 --> 04:44:39.840 align:start position:0%
on on the health care system to
 
04:44:42.628 --> 04:44:42.638 align:start position:0%
raise prices on some people to
 
04:44:44.230 --> 04:44:44.240 align:start position:0%
accommodate for others
 
04:44:45.350 --> 04:44:45.360 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:44:47.270 --> 04:44:47.280 align:start position:0%
it's just a broken system and it needs
 
04:44:50.150 --> 04:44:50.160 align:start position:0%
we need alternatives
 
04:44:52.550 --> 04:44:52.560 align:start position:0%
representative cofoult
 
04:44:54.628 --> 04:44:54.638 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
04:44:57.110 --> 04:44:57.120 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question so
 
04:44:59.830 --> 04:44:59.840 align:start position:0%
in previous testimony we heard that
 
04:45:02.230 --> 04:45:02.240 align:start position:0%
federal control
 
04:45:03.830 --> 04:45:03.840 align:start position:0%
specifically over
 
04:45:07.430 --> 04:45:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:09.910 --> 04:45:09.920 align:start position:0%
represents a barrier to asserting the
 
04:45:12.470 --> 04:45:12.480 align:start position:0%
right to bodily integrity in our state
 
04:45:13.750 --> 04:45:13.760 align:start position:0%
in other words healthcare workers in
 
04:45:13.760 --> 04:45:15.990 align:start position:0%
in other words healthcare workers in
particular

04:45:15.990 --> 04:45:16.000 align:start position:0%
particular
 
04:45:17.990 --> 04:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
we can't assert that right to bodily
 
04:45:19.510 --> 04:45:19.520 align:start position:0%
integrity for them
 
04:45:21.750 --> 04:45:21.760 align:start position:0%
because federal control so can you speak
 
04:45:23.270 --> 04:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
a little bit to
 
04:45:25.270 --> 04:45:25.280 align:start position:0%
the impact that this
 
04:45:27.910 --> 04:45:27.920 align:start position:0%
legislation would have on
 
04:45:30.470 --> 04:45:30.480 align:start position:0%
that specifically and if there are other
 
04:45:32.788 --> 04:45:32.798 align:start position:0%
areas around federal control
 
04:45:35.590 --> 04:45:35.600 align:start position:0%
of our health care here in new hampshire
 
04:45:37.670 --> 04:45:37.680 align:start position:0%
can you address those as well thank you
 
04:45:39.510 --> 04:45:39.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
04:45:39.520 --> 04:45:40.708 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
so

04:45:40.708 --> 04:45:40.718 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:45:42.788 --> 04:45:42.798 align:start position:0%
i mean i feel like
 
04:45:42.798 --> 04:45:44.150 align:start position:0%
i mean i feel like
cms

04:45:44.150 --> 04:45:44.160 align:start position:0%
cms
 
04:45:45.350 --> 04:45:45.360 align:start position:0%
is a way
 
04:45:47.590 --> 04:45:47.600 align:start position:0%
or has been shown to be a way that the
 
04:45:49.910 --> 04:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
federal government can get its tentacles
 
04:45:51.910 --> 04:45:51.920 align:start position:0%
into the way that new hampshire does
 
04:45:54.470 --> 04:45:54.480 align:start position:0%
business right it just reaches out and
 
04:45:56.310 --> 04:45:56.320 align:start position:0%
it turns a lever and it says you can't
 
04:45:58.550 --> 04:45:58.560 align:start position:0%
do things this way or
 
04:46:00.628 --> 04:46:00.638 align:start position:0%
we're gonna you know hold payment over
 
04:46:02.070 --> 04:46:02.080 align:start position:0%
you or
 
04:46:04.868 --> 04:46:04.878 align:start position:0%
and this would help alleviate that issue
 
04:46:06.390 --> 04:46:06.400 align:start position:0%
so it would preserve our state
 
04:46:08.628 --> 04:46:08.638 align:start position:0%
sovereignty and that we can make our own
 
04:46:13.110 --> 04:46:13.120 align:start position:0%
rules for our health care facilities and
 
04:46:14.070 --> 04:46:14.080 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:46:15.510 --> 04:46:15.520 align:start position:0%
they don't have to comply with the
 
04:46:17.510 --> 04:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
federal government may not be you know
 
04:46:19.350 --> 04:46:19.360 align:start position:0%
sometimes federal government makes
 
04:46:20.948 --> 04:46:20.958 align:start position:0%
regulations that are not in the best
 
04:46:22.390 --> 04:46:22.400 align:start position:0%
interests of new hampshire and we need
 
04:46:23.910 --> 04:46:23.920 align:start position:0%
to be able to have
 
04:46:27.350 --> 04:46:27.360 align:start position:0%
our own system that works for our state
 
04:46:29.270 --> 04:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
representative leon
 
04:46:30.788 --> 04:46:30.798 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
04:46:33.270 --> 04:46:33.280 align:start position:0%
representative for taking the question
 
04:46:35.270 --> 04:46:35.280 align:start position:0%
are you aware that
 
04:46:37.110 --> 04:46:37.120 align:start position:0%
one of the problems that's going on with
 
04:46:39.270 --> 04:46:39.280 align:start position:0%
maternity care is that medicaid
 
04:46:41.030 --> 04:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
reimburses for a certain amount of time
 
04:46:43.670 --> 04:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
within the hospital and given that time
 
04:46:45.750 --> 04:46:45.760 align:start position:0%
frame when they're no longer paid for
 
04:46:47.590 --> 04:46:47.600 align:start position:0%
these mothers and babies
 
04:46:50.390 --> 04:46:50.400 align:start position:0%
they don't have time to waste on a slow
 
04:46:53.270 --> 04:46:53.280 align:start position:0%
labor they don't have time to waste on
 
04:46:55.030 --> 04:46:55.040 align:start position:0%
allowing a woman to
 
04:46:58.070 --> 04:46:58.080 align:start position:0%
birth off the clock and that drives more
 
04:46:59.990 --> 04:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
expensive interventions that then have a
 
04:47:02.868 --> 04:47:02.878 align:start position:0%
cascading factor on both outcomes and
 
04:47:02.878 --> 04:47:03.910 align:start position:0%
cascading factor on both outcomes and
costs

04:47:03.910 --> 04:47:03.920 align:start position:0%
costs
 
04:47:06.230 --> 04:47:06.240 align:start position:0%
and do you think that
 
04:47:08.788 --> 04:47:08.798 align:start position:0%
in a system uncoupled from that
 
04:47:11.270 --> 04:47:11.280 align:start position:0%
those handcuffs of reimbursement we
 
04:47:13.110 --> 04:47:13.120 align:start position:0%
might be able to provide
 
04:47:15.350 --> 04:47:15.360 align:start position:0%
improved maternity care at a lower price
 
04:47:16.788 --> 04:47:16.798 align:start position:0%
and that we might be able to have a
 
04:47:19.030 --> 04:47:19.040 align:start position:0%
chance to do that
 
04:47:20.628 --> 04:47:20.638 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question yes that
 
04:47:22.948 --> 04:47:22.958 align:start position:0%
highlights exactly what the intention of
 
04:47:24.868 --> 04:47:24.878 align:start position:0%
the bill is for
 
04:47:26.628 --> 04:47:26.638 align:start position:0%
we have these very high health care
 
04:47:28.788 --> 04:47:28.798 align:start position:0%
costs a lot of it is because of
 
04:47:31.110 --> 04:47:31.120 align:start position:0%
convoluted regulation
 
04:47:31.120 --> 04:47:32.310 align:start position:0%
convoluted regulation
and

04:47:32.310 --> 04:47:32.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:47:32.320 --> 04:47:33.270 align:start position:0%
and
price

04:47:33.270 --> 04:47:33.280 align:start position:0%
price
 
04:47:36.470 --> 04:47:36.480 align:start position:0%
uh negotiations behind the scenes
 
04:47:39.430 --> 04:47:39.440 align:start position:0%
that are not transparent to consumers
 
04:47:40.788 --> 04:47:40.798 align:start position:0%
and if we had
 
04:47:42.948 --> 04:47:42.958 align:start position:0%
people paying for care
 
04:47:45.750 --> 04:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
instead of insurance or being taxed and
 
04:47:48.390 --> 04:47:48.400 align:start position:0%
paying for insurance
 
04:47:50.948 --> 04:47:50.958 align:start position:0%
you know it would result in lowering
 
04:47:54.310 --> 04:47:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:54.320 --> 04:47:55.350 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

04:47:55.350 --> 04:47:55.360 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
04:47:58.788 --> 04:47:58.798 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and listening to
 
04:48:01.110 --> 04:48:01.120 align:start position:0%
all of these challenges does it seem to
 
04:48:02.868 --> 04:48:02.878 align:start position:0%
you like it does to me that the real
 
04:48:05.190 --> 04:48:05.200 align:start position:0%
problem is the way that medicaid and
 
04:48:06.868 --> 04:48:06.878 align:start position:0%
medicare reimburse
 
04:48:09.110 --> 04:48:09.120 align:start position:0%
and not anything else
 
04:48:11.030 --> 04:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
or that those are primary
 
04:48:12.788 --> 04:48:12.798 align:start position:0%
thank you i i would agree that those are
 
04:48:16.070 --> 04:48:16.080 align:start position:0%
the pr our primary issues they they
 
04:48:18.948 --> 04:48:18.958 align:start position:0%
reimburse at a very low rate
 
04:48:21.190 --> 04:48:21.200 align:start position:0%
and you know it just
 
04:48:23.510 --> 04:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
skews the entire health care industry
 
04:48:24.470 --> 04:48:24.480 align:start position:0%
and it
 
04:48:27.190 --> 04:48:27.200 align:start position:0%
makes this choke hold on it where you
 
04:48:29.670 --> 04:48:29.680 align:start position:0%
know it it
 
04:48:31.990 --> 04:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
inhibits innovation it inhibits quality
 
04:48:32.000 --> 04:48:33.110 align:start position:0%
inhibits innovation it inhibits quality
care

04:48:33.110 --> 04:48:33.120 align:start position:0%
care
 
04:48:35.190 --> 04:48:35.200 align:start position:0%
you know something needs to be done it's
 
04:48:37.350 --> 04:48:37.360 align:start position:0%
broken and we keep saying well
 
04:48:39.750 --> 04:48:39.760 align:start position:0%
well but here's the problem we can't get
 
04:48:41.430 --> 04:48:41.440 align:start position:0%
away from it because we depend on it
 
04:48:43.270 --> 04:48:43.280 align:start position:0%
well maybe we need to stop depending on
 
04:48:43.280 --> 04:48:45.270 align:start position:0%
well maybe we need to stop depending on
it

04:48:45.270 --> 04:48:45.280 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:48:48.788 --> 04:48:48.798 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative woods
 
04:48:50.230 --> 04:48:50.240 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
04:48:52.150 --> 04:48:52.160 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh i just need a
 
04:48:54.390 --> 04:48:54.400 align:start position:0%
little guidance as to how this gets
 
04:48:56.390 --> 04:48:56.400 align:start position:0%
started and then how it would actually
 
04:48:58.788 --> 04:48:58.798 align:start position:0%
play out being an orthopedic or retired
 
04:49:01.270 --> 04:49:01.280 align:start position:0%
orthopedic surgeon
 
04:49:03.030 --> 04:49:03.040 align:start position:0%
someone comes and
 
04:49:05.190 --> 04:49:05.200 align:start position:0%
has a fractured hip and emergency room
 
04:49:07.430 --> 04:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
is closed
 
04:49:09.990 --> 04:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
but they're a member of the hospital
 
04:49:13.110 --> 04:49:13.120 align:start position:0%
what what happens to that patient
 
04:49:15.110 --> 04:49:15.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
04:49:17.350 --> 04:49:17.360 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure i i just want to remove the
 
04:49:20.470 --> 04:49:20.480 align:start position:0%
barrier of entry i don't foresee really
 
04:49:20.480 --> 04:49:21.270 align:start position:0%
barrier of entry i don't foresee really
a

04:49:21.270 --> 04:49:21.280 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:49:22.948 --> 04:49:22.958 align:start position:0%
hospital having
 
04:49:25.750 --> 04:49:25.760 align:start position:0%
not having 24-hour emergency room
 
04:49:25.760 --> 04:49:27.270 align:start position:0%
not having 24-hour emergency room
services

04:49:27.270 --> 04:49:27.280 align:start position:0%
services
 
04:49:27.280 --> 04:49:28.708 align:start position:0%
services
unless

04:49:28.708 --> 04:49:28.718 align:start position:0%
unless
 
04:49:31.430 --> 04:49:31.440 align:start position:0%
unless they're just starting out and in
 
04:49:33.750 --> 04:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
that event they say listen
 
04:49:35.430 --> 04:49:35.440 align:start position:0%
when you start here as a member we're
 
04:49:37.350 --> 04:49:37.360 align:start position:0%
not open these hours we're just starting
 
04:49:40.070 --> 04:49:40.080 align:start position:0%
we don't have the staff yet
 
04:49:40.080 --> 04:49:40.948 align:start position:0%
we don't have the staff yet
but

04:49:40.948 --> 04:49:40.958 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:49:42.628 --> 04:49:42.638 align:start position:0%
this is the closest emergency room
 
04:49:45.110 --> 04:49:45.120 align:start position:0%
besides us that's open 24 hours a day
 
04:49:46.470 --> 04:49:46.480 align:start position:0%
and i'm sorry we won't be here to
 
04:49:48.390 --> 04:49:48.400 align:start position:0%
accommodate you that it's clearly marked
 
04:49:51.910 --> 04:49:51.920 align:start position:0%
on our sign but we we offer services at
 
04:49:53.030 --> 04:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
this time
 
04:49:53.040 --> 04:49:54.310 align:start position:0%
this time
um

04:49:54.310 --> 04:49:54.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:49:54.320 --> 04:49:55.430 align:start position:0%
um
follow-up

04:49:55.430 --> 04:49:55.440 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
04:49:56.628 --> 04:49:56.638 align:start position:0%
in other words i interpret that
 
04:49:56.638 --> 04:49:57.670 align:start position:0%
in other words i interpret that
correctly

04:49:57.670 --> 04:49:57.680 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
04:50:00.310 --> 04:50:00.320 align:start position:0%
for under the certain there's a whole
 
04:50:02.948 --> 04:50:02.958 align:start position:0%
host of other circumstances then that
 
04:50:04.868 --> 04:50:04.878 align:start position:0%
hospital that's getting started would
 
04:50:06.470 --> 04:50:06.480 align:start position:0%
actually depend
 
04:50:09.430 --> 04:50:09.440 align:start position:0%
both functionally and financially
 
04:50:11.030 --> 04:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
on the good graces
 
04:50:14.070 --> 04:50:14.080 align:start position:0%
of an ancillary facility and ancillary
 
04:50:17.430 --> 04:50:17.440 align:start position:0%
staff would that be correct
 
04:50:19.350 --> 04:50:19.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
04:50:21.670 --> 04:50:21.680 align:start position:0%
well it would be starting it wouldn't be
 
04:50:23.670 --> 04:50:23.680 align:start position:0%
starting in a test tube there are
 
04:50:26.470 --> 04:50:26.480 align:start position:0%
competing businesses around it that
 
04:50:29.670 --> 04:50:29.680 align:start position:0%
are going to fill in where they can't um
 
04:50:31.990 --> 04:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
you know where they can't their services
 
04:50:34.150 --> 04:50:34.160 align:start position:0%
can't meet the need you know that that's
 
04:50:38.470 --> 04:50:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:41.190 --> 04:50:41.200 align:start position:0%
just one one more i'm just
 
04:50:43.190 --> 04:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
i understand in other businesses this
 
04:50:44.830 --> 04:50:44.840 align:start position:0%
people are not
 
04:50:47.190 --> 04:50:47.200 align:start position:0%
business we're not selling
 
04:50:48.628 --> 04:50:48.638 align:start position:0%
i don't take care of widgets when you
 
04:50:51.030 --> 04:50:51.040 align:start position:0%
come to my office
 
04:50:51.040 --> 04:50:52.150 align:start position:0%
come to my office
and

04:50:52.150 --> 04:50:52.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:50:53.270 --> 04:50:53.280 align:start position:0%
what we're
 
04:50:53.280 --> 04:50:54.550 align:start position:0%
what we're
i'm

04:50:54.550 --> 04:50:54.560 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
04:50:56.150 --> 04:50:56.160 align:start position:0%
i understand the market base because in
 
04:50:58.230 --> 04:50:58.240 align:start position:0%
93 we decided to
 
04:50:59.430 --> 04:50:59.440 align:start position:0%
deliver our health care in a
 
04:51:00.788 --> 04:51:00.798 align:start position:0%
market-based system rather than a
 
04:51:02.708 --> 04:51:02.718 align:start position:0%
government-based system but i guess my
 
04:51:04.230 --> 04:51:04.240 align:start position:0%
concern is and i
 
04:51:06.390 --> 04:51:06.400 align:start position:0%
i think i understand you correct and
 
04:51:09.110 --> 04:51:09.120 align:start position:0%
correct me if i'm wrong is
 
04:51:11.910 --> 04:51:11.920 align:start position:0%
this would depend on the good graces of
 
04:51:13.590 --> 04:51:13.600 align:start position:0%
the surrounding
 
04:51:16.550 --> 04:51:16.560 align:start position:0%
medical structure until this entity that
 
04:51:19.190 --> 04:51:19.200 align:start position:0%
you're starting gets underway and can be
 
04:51:22.150 --> 04:51:22.160 align:start position:0%
full full scale is that correct
 
04:51:23.990 --> 04:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i just don't
 
04:51:26.550 --> 04:51:26.560 align:start position:0%
agree with your term good graces
 
04:51:29.270 --> 04:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
the existing structure exists a new
 
04:51:31.110 --> 04:51:31.120 align:start position:0%
structure comes in and offers a
 
04:51:33.670 --> 04:51:33.680 align:start position:0%
different service and people can
 
04:51:35.590 --> 04:51:35.600 align:start position:0%
take advantage of that but where it
 
04:51:37.750 --> 04:51:37.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't fill that need they still
 
04:51:40.708 --> 04:51:40.718 align:start position:0%
rely on what's already there
 
04:51:40.718 --> 04:51:41.670 align:start position:0%
rely on what's already there
until

04:51:41.670 --> 04:51:41.680 align:start position:0%
until
 
04:51:43.590 --> 04:51:43.600 align:start position:0%
another business or that business can
 
04:51:45.350 --> 04:51:45.360 align:start position:0%
then fill that
 
04:51:45.360 --> 04:51:47.270 align:start position:0%
then fill that
demand

04:51:47.270 --> 04:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
demand
 
04:51:48.868 --> 04:51:48.878 align:start position:0%
the way markets do
 
04:51:51.350 --> 04:51:51.360 align:start position:0%
right and the more demand for that thing
 
04:51:53.590 --> 04:51:53.600 align:start position:0%
that's not being met the more
 
04:51:55.350 --> 04:51:55.360 align:start position:0%
opportunity for entrepreneurs to come in
 
04:52:00.390 --> 04:52:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:02.150 --> 04:52:02.160 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions thank you
 
04:52:04.070 --> 04:52:04.080 align:start position:0%
representative for your testimony the
 
04:52:34.310 --> 04:52:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:36.070 --> 04:52:36.080 align:start position:0%
it says good morning but now it's
 
04:52:39.750 --> 04:52:39.760 align:start position:0%
afternoon so good afternoon
 
04:52:41.590 --> 04:52:41.600 align:start position:0%
mr chairman members of the committee my
 
04:52:43.270 --> 04:52:43.280 align:start position:0%
name is paula minihan senior vice
 
04:52:44.550 --> 04:52:44.560 align:start position:0%
president state government relations for
 
04:52:46.470 --> 04:52:46.480 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire hospital association
 
04:52:48.310 --> 04:52:48.320 align:start position:0%
representing all our state's community
 
04:52:50.230 --> 04:52:50.240 align:start position:0%
hospitals as well as our specialty
 
04:52:52.788 --> 04:52:52.798 align:start position:0%
hospitals we are opposed to this bill we
 
04:52:54.470 --> 04:52:54.480 align:start position:0%
do have concerns that this bill would
 
04:52:56.550 --> 04:52:56.560 align:start position:0%
impede access to services if a health
 
04:52:58.390 --> 04:52:58.400 align:start position:0%
care facility is not required to have
 
04:53:00.708 --> 04:53:00.718 align:start position:0%
charity care policy in place
 
04:53:02.390 --> 04:53:02.400 align:start position:0%
we also have questions about the intent
 
04:53:04.150 --> 04:53:04.160 align:start position:0%
of the legislation and what the sponsor
 
04:53:06.628 --> 04:53:06.638 align:start position:0%
is attempting to address i understand
 
04:53:09.430 --> 04:53:09.440 align:start position:0%
better now that i've heard it introduced
 
04:53:11.510 --> 04:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
i have not seen the amendment so i am at
 
04:53:14.550 --> 04:53:14.560 align:start position:0%
a disadvantage there sounds like it is
 
04:53:16.948 --> 04:53:16.958 align:start position:0%
much more um
 
04:53:20.230 --> 04:53:20.240 align:start position:0%
expansive um than what um the original
 
04:53:23.030 --> 04:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
bill is so that is um that makes me at a
 
04:53:25.510 --> 04:53:25.520 align:start position:0%
disadvantage unfortunately um
 
04:53:27.670 --> 04:53:27.680 align:start position:0%
but i you know have been around long
 
04:53:29.990 --> 04:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
enough to understand um since i ran the
 
04:53:31.590 --> 04:53:31.600 align:start position:0%
c-o-n um
 
04:53:33.750 --> 04:53:33.760 align:start position:0%
board for a while
 
04:53:36.470 --> 04:53:36.480 align:start position:0%
and earlier in my
 
04:53:39.750 --> 04:53:39.760 align:start position:0%
career so the bill analysis states that
 
04:53:41.430 --> 04:53:41.440 align:start position:0%
this legislation would exempt
 
04:53:43.670 --> 04:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
membership-based healthcare facilities
 
04:53:45.910 --> 04:53:45.920 align:start position:0%
from the adoption of certain policies
 
04:53:48.070 --> 04:53:48.080 align:start position:0%
relative to access to care and financial
 
04:53:48.080 --> 04:53:49.270 align:start position:0%
relative to access to care and financial
assistance

04:53:49.270 --> 04:53:49.280 align:start position:0%
assistance
 
04:53:51.350 --> 04:53:51.360 align:start position:0%
the bill requires membership-based
 
04:53:53.270 --> 04:53:53.280 align:start position:0%
hospitals with emergency departments to
 
04:53:55.510 --> 04:53:55.520 align:start position:0%
prominently post notices that the
 
04:53:58.070 --> 04:53:58.080 align:start position:0%
facility serves members only
 
04:54:00.310 --> 04:54:00.320 align:start position:0%
the way we read the bill any health care
 
04:54:01.910 --> 04:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
facility not just hospitals could
 
04:54:03.830 --> 04:54:03.840 align:start position:0%
discriminate against individuals that do
 
04:54:06.150 --> 04:54:06.160 align:start position:0%
not participate in a membership-based
 
04:54:07.590 --> 04:54:07.600 align:start position:0%
business model
 
04:54:09.590 --> 04:54:09.600 align:start position:0%
and it is discrimination it's setting up
 
04:54:12.310 --> 04:54:12.320 align:start position:0%
a bifurcated system that we obviously do
 
04:54:14.708 --> 04:54:14.718 align:start position:0%
not support our hospitals are driven by
 
04:54:17.510 --> 04:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
their mission to treat all
 
04:54:17.520 --> 04:54:18.628 align:start position:0%
their mission to treat all
regardless

04:54:18.628 --> 04:54:18.638 align:start position:0%
regardless
 
04:54:20.628 --> 04:54:20.638 align:start position:0%
of their ability to pay
 
04:54:22.948 --> 04:54:22.958 align:start position:0%
this does not do that um we are not
 
04:54:25.510 --> 04:54:25.520 align:start position:0%
opposed to competition please understand
 
04:54:27.110 --> 04:54:27.120 align:start position:0%
that that is not what we're opposed to
 
04:54:28.550 --> 04:54:28.560 align:start position:0%
we're opposed to
 
04:54:32.150 --> 04:54:32.160 align:start position:0%
having a hospital bifurcate the system
 
04:54:34.708 --> 04:54:34.718 align:start position:0%
and only take those that can pay this
 
04:54:36.150 --> 04:54:36.160 align:start position:0%
membership fee
 
04:54:37.830 --> 04:54:37.840 align:start position:0%
which when you think about what how a
 
04:54:40.708 --> 04:54:40.718 align:start position:0%
hospital operates they operate 24 7 at a
 
04:54:43.430 --> 04:54:43.440 align:start position:0%
loss in many many of their departments i
 
04:54:45.430 --> 04:54:45.440 align:start position:0%
have no idea how you could
 
04:54:47.510 --> 04:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
calculate a membership fee that could
 
04:54:49.670 --> 04:54:49.680 align:start position:0%
possibly cover
 
04:54:49.680 --> 04:54:50.708 align:start position:0%
possibly cover
that

04:54:50.708 --> 04:54:50.718 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:54:53.110 --> 04:54:53.120 align:start position:0%
this membership fee on a monthly basis
 
04:54:54.310 --> 04:54:54.320 align:start position:0%
believe me it's going to be more than
 
04:54:54.320 --> 04:54:56.868 align:start position:0%
believe me it's going to be more than
200

04:54:56.868 --> 04:54:56.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:58.788 --> 04:54:58.798 align:start position:0%
the bill allows for these types of
 
04:55:01.270 --> 04:55:01.280 align:start position:0%
facilities if they exclusively provide
 
04:55:03.350 --> 04:55:03.360 align:start position:0%
services to persons who are members of
 
04:55:04.788 --> 04:55:04.798 align:start position:0%
their business
 
04:55:06.868 --> 04:55:06.878 align:start position:0%
to not have a charity care policy all
 
04:55:08.708 --> 04:55:08.718 align:start position:0%
hospital all health care facilities that
 
04:55:11.030 --> 04:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
currently fall under this statute and
 
04:55:12.310 --> 04:55:12.320 align:start position:0%
are licensed by the state of new
 
04:55:14.070 --> 04:55:14.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire provide care to all patients
 
04:55:16.470 --> 04:55:16.480 align:start position:0%
regardless of their ability to pay
 
04:55:18.230 --> 04:55:18.240 align:start position:0%
we do not believe it is in the best
 
04:55:19.990 --> 04:55:20.000 align:start position:0%
interest of the patients seeking care in
 
04:55:21.830 --> 04:55:21.840 align:start position:0%
these facilities to not be assured that
 
04:55:23.750 --> 04:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
the facility maintains a charity care
 
04:55:26.550 --> 04:55:26.560 align:start position:0%
policy we are not aware of a licensed
 
04:55:28.470 --> 04:55:28.480 align:start position:0%
healthcare facility that only accepts
 
04:55:30.628 --> 04:55:30.638 align:start position:0%
payments under membership-based business
 
04:55:33.990 --> 04:55:34.000 align:start position:0%
model i checked and um not this does not
 
04:55:35.430 --> 04:55:35.440 align:start position:0%
exist throughout the country to my
 
04:55:37.830 --> 04:55:37.840 align:start position:0%
knowledge further there is no definition
 
04:55:39.670 --> 04:55:39.680 align:start position:0%
of such a model in the healthcare
 
04:55:41.750 --> 04:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
facility environment
 
04:55:43.510 --> 04:55:43.520 align:start position:0%
if this is attempting to expand the
 
04:55:46.470 --> 04:55:46.480 align:start position:0%
direct primary care model to hospitals
 
04:55:48.470 --> 04:55:48.480 align:start position:0%
that is a very concerning approach in
 
04:55:50.788 --> 04:55:50.798 align:start position:0%
our opinion and does not it's not one
 
04:55:52.230 --> 04:55:52.240 align:start position:0%
that the state of new hampshire should
 
04:55:52.240 --> 04:55:53.430 align:start position:0%
that the state of new hampshire should
embrace

04:55:53.430 --> 04:55:53.440 align:start position:0%
embrace
 
04:55:55.670 --> 04:55:55.680 align:start position:0%
how would this work posting a highly
 
04:55:58.470 --> 04:55:58.480 align:start position:0%
visible notice as stated in the bill
 
04:56:01.190 --> 04:56:01.200 align:start position:0%
that the facility serves members only
 
04:56:02.788 --> 04:56:02.798 align:start position:0%
could lead to much confusion and
 
04:56:05.510 --> 04:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
potentially catastrophic results what if
 
04:56:06.948 --> 04:56:06.958 align:start position:0%
a patient in the middle of the night
 
04:56:08.628 --> 04:56:08.638 align:start position:0%
needing emergency care shows up at the
 
04:56:10.390 --> 04:56:10.400 align:start position:0%
nearest hospital emergency room which
 
04:56:13.350 --> 04:56:13.360 align:start position:0%
happens to be membership-based facility
 
04:56:15.350 --> 04:56:15.360 align:start position:0%
will the patient be turned away this
 
04:56:17.350 --> 04:56:17.360 align:start position:0%
bill if passed could also violate
 
04:56:19.110 --> 04:56:19.120 align:start position:0%
current licensing laws relative to
 
04:56:21.750 --> 04:56:21.760 align:start position:0%
emergency departments and to clarify
 
04:56:25.190 --> 04:56:25.200 align:start position:0%
emtala only applies it was mentioned um
 
04:56:27.990 --> 04:56:28.000 align:start position:0%
and patala only applies to medicare to
 
04:56:29.910 --> 04:56:29.920 align:start position:0%
facilities that accept medicare so this
 
04:56:31.910 --> 04:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
amtala would not apply in this case if
 
04:56:34.150 --> 04:56:34.160 align:start position:0%
they don't take medicare
 
04:56:36.230 --> 04:56:36.240 align:start position:0%
nha does not believe this bill is
 
04:56:37.910 --> 04:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
appropriate and we would ask that you
 
04:56:40.070 --> 04:56:40.080 align:start position:0%
find this bill in expedient to legislate
 
04:56:41.830 --> 04:56:41.840 align:start position:0%
and thank you for the opportunity to
 
04:56:44.230 --> 04:56:44.240 align:start position:0%
provide our comments i think i had a
 
04:56:45.750 --> 04:56:45.760 align:start position:0%
couple more
 
04:56:45.760 --> 04:56:46.788 align:start position:0%
couple more
um

04:56:46.788 --> 04:56:46.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:56:46.798 --> 04:56:47.670 align:start position:0%
um
again

04:56:47.670 --> 04:56:47.680 align:start position:0%
again
 
04:56:50.708 --> 04:56:50.718 align:start position:0%
hospitals there are certain departments
 
04:56:53.590 --> 04:56:53.600 align:start position:0%
emergency rooms are one that lose a lot
 
04:56:54.948 --> 04:56:54.958 align:start position:0%
of money
 
04:56:56.628 --> 04:56:56.638 align:start position:0%
ob is another one
 
04:56:58.708 --> 04:56:58.718 align:start position:0%
and that is why unfortunately a number
 
04:57:00.470 --> 04:57:00.480 align:start position:0%
of our critical access hospitals are not
 
04:57:01.830 --> 04:57:01.840 align:start position:0%
able to provide
 
04:57:05.110 --> 04:57:05.120 align:start position:0%
um obstetrical care um there are
 
04:57:08.070 --> 04:57:08.080 align:start position:0%
alternative models so i i truly am um
 
04:57:11.190 --> 04:57:11.200 align:start position:0%
confused um about why why we're um
 
04:57:13.350 --> 04:57:13.360 align:start position:0%
considering this because there are
 
04:57:15.750 --> 04:57:15.760 align:start position:0%
midwives they do have independent
 
04:57:17.830 --> 04:57:17.840 align:start position:0%
birthing centers i think there's one up
 
04:57:20.470 --> 04:57:20.480 align:start position:0%
north that is um struggling and trying
 
04:57:21.590 --> 04:57:21.600 align:start position:0%
to get
 
04:57:24.310 --> 04:57:24.320 align:start position:0%
enhanced reimbursement from medicaid
 
04:57:26.390 --> 04:57:26.400 align:start position:0%
because they realize that they cannot
 
04:57:28.470 --> 04:57:28.480 align:start position:0%
really make um the business model does
 
04:57:30.788 --> 04:57:30.798 align:start position:0%
not work without medicare reimbursement
 
04:57:32.470 --> 04:57:32.480 align:start position:0%
and we support that
 
04:57:34.628 --> 04:57:34.638 align:start position:0%
we support hospitals having increased
 
04:57:36.310 --> 04:57:36.320 align:start position:0%
medicaid reimbursement as well there are
 
04:57:37.990 --> 04:57:38.000 align:start position:0%
two bills in the senate that actually
 
04:57:41.030 --> 04:57:41.040 align:start position:0%
address that issue so we um and again
 
04:57:43.030 --> 04:57:43.040 align:start position:0%
there are other ways i think to go about
 
04:57:44.310 --> 04:57:44.320 align:start position:0%
this but
 
04:57:46.470 --> 04:57:46.480 align:start position:0%
having a membership only
 
04:57:48.470 --> 04:57:48.480 align:start position:0%
hospital is again
 
04:57:51.750 --> 04:57:51.760 align:start position:0%
foreign to our understanding um have not
 
04:57:53.750 --> 04:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
seen this anywhere else and i would like
 
04:57:55.830 --> 04:57:55.840 align:start position:0%
to see the amendment to be able to
 
04:57:58.868 --> 04:57:58.878 align:start position:0%
comment on that separately but um we um
 
04:58:01.030 --> 04:58:01.040 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to answer any questions do you
 
04:58:02.948 --> 04:58:02.958 align:start position:0%
does anyone have any questions from miss
 
04:58:02.958 --> 04:58:05.990 align:start position:0%
does anyone have any questions from miss
minihan

04:58:05.990 --> 04:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:07.830 --> 04:58:07.840 align:start position:0%
all right betty gay rep sorry
 
04:58:10.550 --> 04:58:10.560 align:start position:0%
representative gay
 
04:58:11.510 --> 04:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:58:11.520 --> 04:58:13.270 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

04:58:13.270 --> 04:58:13.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:58:16.550 --> 04:58:16.560 align:start position:0%
i have a couple of questions and one is
 
04:58:19.590 --> 04:58:19.600 align:start position:0%
did i understand you properly that we do
 
04:58:21.990 --> 04:58:22.000 align:start position:0%
have hospitals that are permitted to
 
04:58:24.628 --> 04:58:24.638 align:start position:0%
exclude medicare
 
04:58:28.470 --> 04:58:28.480 align:start position:0%
no um no the testimony of the sponsor
 
04:58:31.270 --> 04:58:31.280 align:start position:0%
indicated that emtala would apply in the
 
04:58:34.948 --> 04:58:34.958 align:start position:0%
in this case um under the bill and
 
04:58:37.510 --> 04:58:37.520 align:start position:0%
what i explained was um if you accept
 
04:58:40.310 --> 04:58:40.320 align:start position:0%
medicare which the i think all hospitals
 
04:58:41.910 --> 04:58:41.920 align:start position:0%
i mean certainly all in new hampshire i
 
04:58:43.430 --> 04:58:43.440 align:start position:0%
can't say all for the entire country
 
04:58:45.110 --> 04:58:45.120 align:start position:0%
there are four thousand of them
 
04:58:48.310 --> 04:58:48.320 align:start position:0%
but um would um ex i think most of them
 
04:58:51.430 --> 04:58:51.440 align:start position:0%
do accept medicare um because probably
 
04:58:54.070 --> 04:58:54.080 align:start position:0%
50 to 60 percent of the revenue
 
04:58:57.590 --> 04:58:57.600 align:start position:0%
model that hospitals
 
04:58:59.350 --> 04:58:59.360 align:start position:0%
follow which again is uh they didn't
 
04:59:01.590 --> 04:59:01.600 align:start position:0%
make it up it's a health care model that
 
04:59:03.670 --> 04:59:03.680 align:start position:0%
is um has been in existence for a long
 
04:59:05.830 --> 04:59:05.840 align:start position:0%
time um medicare and medicaid probably
 
04:59:09.750 --> 04:59:09.760 align:start position:0%
makes up 65 roughly 70 80 for a critical
 
04:59:11.430 --> 04:59:11.440 align:start position:0%
access hospital
 
04:59:13.910 --> 04:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
of their revenue so they could not exist
 
04:59:16.470 --> 04:59:16.480 align:start position:0%
without medicare and medicaid so they
 
04:59:18.948 --> 04:59:18.958 align:start position:0%
all follow mtala which is if you come to
 
04:59:20.788 --> 04:59:20.798 align:start position:0%
the emergency room you will be screened
 
04:59:23.830 --> 04:59:23.840 align:start position:0%
and and um cared for regardless of your
 
04:59:25.590 --> 04:59:25.600 align:start position:0%
ability to pay representative gay on
 
04:59:28.150 --> 04:59:28.160 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes thank you
 
04:59:32.070 --> 04:59:32.080 align:start position:0%
does is it a fair statement to say
 
04:59:32.080 --> 04:59:32.868 align:start position:0%
does is it a fair statement to say
that

04:59:32.868 --> 04:59:32.878 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:59:32.878 --> 04:59:34.230 align:start position:0%
that
hospitals

04:59:34.230 --> 04:59:34.240 align:start position:0%
hospitals
 
04:59:37.270 --> 04:59:37.280 align:start position:0%
have to make up the shortfall
 
04:59:40.070 --> 04:59:40.080 align:start position:0%
from their medicaid
 
04:59:40.080 --> 04:59:41.590 align:start position:0%
from their medicaid
patients

04:59:41.590 --> 04:59:41.600 align:start position:0%
patients
 
04:59:43.110 --> 04:59:43.120 align:start position:0%
by charging
 
04:59:43.120 --> 04:59:44.310 align:start position:0%
by charging
more

04:59:44.310 --> 04:59:44.320 align:start position:0%
more
 
04:59:47.110 --> 04:59:47.120 align:start position:0%
you know they pay less so then all the
 
04:59:49.430 --> 04:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
private pay people whether insurance are
 
04:59:51.670 --> 04:59:51.680 align:start position:0%
out of their pocket they have to make up
 
04:59:51.680 --> 04:59:52.550 align:start position:0%
out of their pocket they have to make up
that

04:59:52.550 --> 04:59:52.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:59:55.190 --> 04:59:55.200 align:start position:0%
no actually the charges are the charges
 
04:59:57.510 --> 04:59:57.520 align:start position:0%
um everyone is charged the same i think
 
04:59:58.550 --> 04:59:58.560 align:start position:0%
i um
 
05:00:00.390 --> 05:00:00.400 align:start position:0%
it's called the charge master i think we
 
05:00:02.150 --> 05:00:02.160 align:start position:0%
talked about this earlier this session
 
05:00:04.830 --> 05:00:04.840 align:start position:0%
um which seems like a long time ago
 
05:00:04.840 --> 05:00:06.470 align:start position:0%
um which seems like a long time ago
um

05:00:06.470 --> 05:00:06.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:00:09.670 --> 05:00:09.680 align:start position:0%
but um they all charge the same as what
 
05:00:13.030 --> 05:00:13.040 align:start position:0%
they're reimbursed is varies
 
05:00:17.030 --> 05:00:17.040 align:start position:0%
the allowable is what is medically
 
05:00:19.430 --> 05:00:19.440 align:start position:0%
medically appropriate um so that's
 
05:00:21.590 --> 05:00:21.600 align:start position:0%
allowable is different and then what
 
05:00:24.788 --> 05:00:24.798 align:start position:0%
medicare reimburses may be 80 cents on
 
05:00:27.350 --> 05:00:27.360 align:start position:0%
the allowable dollar medicaid is
 
05:00:29.190 --> 05:00:29.200 align:start position:0%
probably 50 cents on the allowable
 
05:00:32.470 --> 05:00:32.480 align:start position:0%
dollar and what pri then they negotiate
 
05:00:35.590 --> 05:00:35.600 align:start position:0%
with private insurers and then in
 
05:00:35.600 --> 05:00:36.470 align:start position:0%
with private insurers and then in
non

05:00:36.470 --> 05:00:36.480 align:start position:0%
non
 
05:00:39.110 --> 05:00:39.120 align:start position:0%
uninsured people may or may not pay
 
05:00:41.910 --> 05:00:41.920 align:start position:0%
anything depends if they are unable to
 
05:00:42.948 --> 05:00:42.958 align:start position:0%
or not
 
05:00:45.110 --> 05:00:45.120 align:start position:0%
representative acton
 
05:00:47.350 --> 05:00:47.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
05:00:50.390 --> 05:00:50.400 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question um
 
05:00:52.788 --> 05:00:52.798 align:start position:0%
i've been on the hhs committee for four
 
05:00:54.868 --> 05:00:54.878 align:start position:0%
years now and and every single time
 
05:00:57.350 --> 05:00:57.360 align:start position:0%
somebody comes in with with a new idea
 
05:01:00.310 --> 05:01:00.320 align:start position:0%
of of trying to reform and and
 
05:01:03.190 --> 05:01:03.200 align:start position:0%
um build a new system and fix some of
 
05:01:05.590 --> 05:01:05.600 align:start position:0%
the problems those within the current
 
05:01:08.070 --> 05:01:08.080 align:start position:0%
system who will admit that there's
 
05:01:09.430 --> 05:01:09.440 align:start position:0%
it's broken
 
05:01:12.470 --> 05:01:12.480 align:start position:0%
shoot it down so how do we how we can
 
05:01:14.470 --> 05:01:14.480 align:start position:0%
innovate innovate our way out of the
 
05:01:17.030 --> 05:01:17.040 align:start position:0%
current situation if we keep hitting a
 
05:01:18.788 --> 05:01:18.798 align:start position:0%
brick wall every time
 
05:01:19.830 --> 05:01:19.840 align:start position:0%
we have
 
05:01:21.510 --> 05:01:21.520 align:start position:0%
new ideas come up
 
05:01:23.750 --> 05:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
well hopefully not by bankrupting our
 
05:01:25.510 --> 05:01:25.520 align:start position:0%
hospitals um that have been there
 
05:01:28.070 --> 05:01:28.080 align:start position:0%
through the entire pandemic to remind
 
05:01:30.470 --> 05:01:30.480 align:start position:0%
everyone that have treated thousands of
 
05:01:32.550 --> 05:01:32.560 align:start position:0%
patients um so
 
05:01:35.190 --> 05:01:35.200 align:start position:0%
when you try to change the system that
 
05:01:38.550 --> 05:01:38.560 align:start position:0%
is a that is a macro issue um talk about
 
05:01:41.030 --> 05:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
economics um the supply and demand just
 
05:01:42.948 --> 05:01:42.958 align:start position:0%
doesn't always work in in health care
 
05:01:44.470 --> 05:01:44.480 align:start position:0%
and i think anyone that's in health care
 
05:01:47.670 --> 05:01:47.680 align:start position:0%
understands that right
 
05:01:50.708 --> 05:01:50.718 align:start position:0%
professor soloway um he taught me well
 
05:01:51.990 --> 05:01:52.000 align:start position:0%
um so
 
05:01:54.070 --> 05:01:54.080 align:start position:0%
um that it doesn't always work in health
 
05:01:57.030 --> 05:01:57.040 align:start position:0%
care unfortunately we are not opposed to
 
05:01:59.910 --> 05:01:59.920 align:start position:0%
competition what we are opposed to is
 
05:02:02.948 --> 05:02:02.958 align:start position:0%
again a bifurcated system where are
 
05:02:05.910 --> 05:02:05.920 align:start position:0%
those that cannot afford a membership
 
05:02:08.788 --> 05:02:08.798 align:start position:0%
only system going to get care they're
 
05:02:10.470 --> 05:02:10.480 align:start position:0%
going to go to their community hospital
 
05:02:13.590 --> 05:02:13.600 align:start position:0%
that is there to serve all but if they
 
05:02:16.470 --> 05:02:16.480 align:start position:0%
are they don't have any that are paying
 
05:02:18.788 --> 05:02:18.798 align:start position:0%
for their services they won't be there
 
05:02:20.868 --> 05:02:20.878 align:start position:0%
they won't and that is why
 
05:02:25.270 --> 05:02:25.280 align:start position:0%
when con was eliminated back in 2015
 
05:02:30.310 --> 05:02:30.320 align:start position:0%
why it was decided um in 2018 um with
 
05:02:31.590 --> 05:02:31.600 align:start position:0%
the um
 
05:02:31.600 --> 05:02:32.868 align:start position:0%
the um
expert

05:02:32.868 --> 05:02:32.878 align:start position:0%
expert
 
05:02:35.830 --> 05:02:35.840 align:start position:0%
guidance from senator bradley and many
 
05:02:39.430 --> 05:02:39.440 align:start position:0%
many in this room actually helped to to
 
05:02:41.990 --> 05:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
develop the current system that we have
 
05:02:45.430 --> 05:02:45.440 align:start position:0%
to protect our um our vulnerable most
 
05:02:47.030 --> 05:02:47.040 align:start position:0%
vulnerable hospitals which are the
 
05:02:49.670 --> 05:02:49.680 align:start position:0%
critical access hospitals so it is a
 
05:02:51.830 --> 05:02:51.840 align:start position:0%
really complex issue but remember
 
05:02:55.110 --> 05:02:55.120 align:start position:0%
medicare is 60 to 70. that is a federal
 
05:02:57.190 --> 05:02:57.200 align:start position:0%
program 60 to 70 percent of their
 
05:02:59.190 --> 05:02:59.200 align:start position:0%
revenue for hospitals
 
05:03:00.230 --> 05:03:00.240 align:start position:0%
is um
 
05:03:02.070 --> 05:03:02.080 align:start position:0%
is rece they receive medicare
 
05:03:04.230 --> 05:03:04.240 align:start position:0%
reimbursement so it is a
 
05:03:06.788 --> 05:03:06.798 align:start position:0%
massive issue
 
05:03:08.390 --> 05:03:08.400 align:start position:0%
i would argue that
 
05:03:10.708 --> 05:03:10.718 align:start position:0%
um we can um tweak things around the
 
05:03:12.470 --> 05:03:12.480 align:start position:0%
edges but this is a
 
05:03:15.190 --> 05:03:15.200 align:start position:0%
what is being proposed i would say is um
 
05:03:18.310 --> 05:03:18.320 align:start position:0%
would is um not is not tweaking the
 
05:03:20.230 --> 05:03:20.240 align:start position:0%
system around the edges it would be
 
05:03:22.390 --> 05:03:22.400 align:start position:0%
catastrophic potentially
 
05:03:24.150 --> 05:03:24.160 align:start position:0%
representative leon
 
05:03:25.830 --> 05:03:25.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
05:03:27.910 --> 05:03:27.920 align:start position:0%
being here and taking questions i know
 
05:03:29.670 --> 05:03:29.680 align:start position:0%
one of the biggest problems we're facing
 
05:03:32.708 --> 05:03:32.718 align:start position:0%
today is a shortage of hospital beds and
 
05:03:33.910 --> 05:03:33.920 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if you have the new
 
05:03:36.150 --> 05:03:36.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire specific data but across the
 
05:03:37.830 --> 05:03:37.840 align:start position:0%
country in the states that expanded
 
05:03:39.590 --> 05:03:39.600 align:start position:0%
medicaid the number of hospital beds
 
05:03:41.750 --> 05:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
declined by six percent while other
 
05:03:43.510 --> 05:03:43.520 align:start position:0%
states increased
 
05:03:46.230 --> 05:03:46.240 align:start position:0%
if we are resisting other ways to add
 
05:03:49.110 --> 05:03:49.120 align:start position:0%
new beds through these innovative models
 
05:03:51.030 --> 05:03:51.040 align:start position:0%
is there a way that you see for
 
05:03:53.190 --> 05:03:53.200 align:start position:0%
hospitals to increase beds while they're
 
05:03:56.310 --> 05:03:56.320 align:start position:0%
slowly getting blood dry by the medicaid
 
05:03:56.320 --> 05:03:57.110 align:start position:0%
slowly getting blood dry by the medicaid
so

05:03:57.110 --> 05:03:57.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:03:59.270 --> 05:03:59.280 align:start position:0%
i would say
 
05:03:59.280 --> 05:04:00.628 align:start position:0%
i would say
that

05:04:00.628 --> 05:04:00.638 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:04:03.430 --> 05:04:03.440 align:start position:0%
as far as the inpatient outpatient
 
05:04:03.440 --> 05:04:05.750 align:start position:0%
as far as the inpatient outpatient
pre-pandemic

05:04:05.750 --> 05:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
pre-pandemic
 
05:04:08.230 --> 05:04:08.240 align:start position:0%
i would say about 80 percent of critical
 
05:04:11.110 --> 05:04:11.120 align:start position:0%
access hospitals were seeing patients um
 
05:04:12.390 --> 05:04:12.400 align:start position:0%
outside of
 
05:04:14.948 --> 05:04:14.958 align:start position:0%
their inpatient setting they are limited
 
05:04:17.270 --> 05:04:17.280 align:start position:0%
to 25 beds
 
05:04:19.350 --> 05:04:19.360 align:start position:0%
and they
 
05:04:20.948 --> 05:04:20.958 align:start position:0%
the majority of what they provide is
 
05:04:22.708 --> 05:04:22.718 align:start position:0%
outpatient and
 
05:04:24.550 --> 05:04:24.560 align:start position:0%
again back to the special health care
 
05:04:27.750 --> 05:04:27.760 align:start position:0%
services and why they why this committee
 
05:04:31.430 --> 05:04:31.440 align:start position:0%
back in 2019
 
05:04:31.440 --> 05:04:32.868 align:start position:0%
back in 2019
18.

05:04:32.868 --> 05:04:32.878 align:start position:0%
18.
 
05:04:35.190 --> 05:04:35.200 align:start position:0%
passed the special healthcare services
 
05:04:39.190 --> 05:04:39.200 align:start position:0%
bill is because um they are they allow
 
05:04:41.270 --> 05:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
for competition because again so much is
 
05:04:42.868 --> 05:04:42.878 align:start position:0%
done on an outpatient basis it just
 
05:04:45.350 --> 05:04:45.360 align:start position:0%
needs to be more of a
 
05:04:46.948 --> 05:04:46.958 align:start position:0%
fair equal
 
05:04:48.708 --> 05:04:48.718 align:start position:0%
footing because
 
05:04:51.190 --> 05:04:51.200 align:start position:0%
we want to ensure that those individuals
 
05:04:52.868 --> 05:04:52.878 align:start position:0%
are that are competing with the
 
05:04:55.430 --> 05:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
hospitals are providing charity care
 
05:04:57.430 --> 05:04:57.440 align:start position:0%
because again the hospitals
 
05:05:01.670 --> 05:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
do take all comers so the hospital
 
05:05:01.680 --> 05:05:03.350 align:start position:0%
do take all comers so the hospital
bed

05:05:03.350 --> 05:05:03.360 align:start position:0%
bed
 
05:05:06.390 --> 05:05:06.400 align:start position:0%
scarcity has not honestly been an issue
 
05:05:08.310 --> 05:05:08.320 align:start position:0%
until we had staff beds and we have
 
05:05:09.750 --> 05:05:09.760 align:start position:0%
license beds
 
05:05:11.750 --> 05:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
we had many more licensed beds in the
 
05:05:13.270 --> 05:05:13.280 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire than like then
 
05:05:15.350 --> 05:05:15.360 align:start position:0%
staff beds for a long time and it wasn't
 
05:05:17.350 --> 05:05:17.360 align:start position:0%
because of a staff shortage it had to do
 
05:05:19.750 --> 05:05:19.760 align:start position:0%
with again more and more services are
 
05:05:22.550 --> 05:05:22.560 align:start position:0%
being um provided on an outpatient basis
 
05:05:25.750 --> 05:05:25.760 align:start position:0%
so i um again um we're we're still in
 
05:05:28.310 --> 05:05:28.320 align:start position:0%
the pandemic and and things are are kind
 
05:05:30.628 --> 05:05:30.638 align:start position:0%
of topsy-turvy right now relative to bed
 
05:05:33.350 --> 05:05:33.360 align:start position:0%
capacity but um
 
05:05:36.070 --> 05:05:36.080 align:start position:0%
i again we are not against competition
 
05:05:38.948 --> 05:05:38.958 align:start position:0%
what we are against is um an un
 
05:05:41.430 --> 05:05:41.440 align:start position:0%
fair play playing field and a bifurcated
 
05:05:43.350 --> 05:05:43.360 align:start position:0%
system thank you very much we're only
 
05:05:45.030 --> 05:05:45.040 align:start position:0%
going to take two more questions now
 
05:05:46.550 --> 05:05:46.560 align:start position:0%
because we're running terribly late
 
05:05:48.310 --> 05:05:48.320 align:start position:0%
please try to make the answer briefer
 
05:05:50.708 --> 05:05:50.718 align:start position:0%
please representative soloway to your
 
05:05:50.718 --> 05:05:52.788 align:start position:0%
please representative soloway to your
student

05:05:52.788 --> 05:05:52.798 align:start position:0%
student
 
05:05:54.868 --> 05:05:54.878 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you vice
 
05:05:56.868 --> 05:05:56.878 align:start position:0%
president minigame it's always a
 
05:05:56.878 --> 05:05:58.070 align:start position:0%
president minigame it's always a
pleasure

05:05:58.070 --> 05:05:58.080 align:start position:0%
pleasure
 
05:06:00.550 --> 05:06:00.560 align:start position:0%
being the third oldest member of this
 
05:06:02.550 --> 05:06:02.560 align:start position:0%
committee i remember the world before
 
05:06:04.310 --> 05:06:04.320 align:start position:0%
medicare and medicaid
 
05:06:07.110 --> 05:06:07.120 align:start position:0%
now it has been alleged in testimony
 
05:06:10.708 --> 05:06:10.718 align:start position:0%
here that we have an extreme shortage of
 
05:06:12.788 --> 05:06:12.798 align:start position:0%
healthcare personnel we have a shortage
 
05:06:16.708 --> 05:06:16.718 align:start position:0%
of beds and the system is broken is it
 
05:06:19.430 --> 05:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
your opinion that the system is
 
05:06:21.990 --> 05:06:22.000 align:start position:0%
inexorably broken
 
05:06:25.350 --> 05:06:25.360 align:start position:0%
the system needs to be um
 
05:06:27.510 --> 05:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
i mean it's it's just very complex
 
05:06:30.550 --> 05:06:30.560 align:start position:0%
because the way health care financing
 
05:06:33.030 --> 05:06:33.040 align:start position:0%
works as you're well aware we have
 
05:06:36.470 --> 05:06:36.480 align:start position:0%
government payers and we have um
 
05:06:39.350 --> 05:06:39.360 align:start position:0%
private payers if you will through um
 
05:06:42.150 --> 05:06:42.160 align:start position:0%
through insurance so it's just a very
 
05:06:44.708 --> 05:06:44.718 align:start position:0%
very complex system i would say we have
 
05:06:46.708 --> 05:06:46.718 align:start position:0%
the best quality of care and new
 
05:06:49.270 --> 05:06:49.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire i think ranks very high um in
 
05:06:51.910 --> 05:06:51.920 align:start position:0%
the country so um and in the world we
 
05:06:54.070 --> 05:06:54.080 align:start position:0%
have very very good health care so i'm
 
05:06:57.430 --> 05:06:57.440 align:start position:0%
very proud of that um the system is um
 
05:07:01.350 --> 05:07:01.360 align:start position:0%
is complex and certainly um there's you
 
05:07:01.360 --> 05:07:02.150 align:start position:0%
is complex and certainly um there's you
know

05:07:02.150 --> 05:07:02.160 align:start position:0%
know
 
05:07:04.550 --> 05:07:04.560 align:start position:0%
i mean that that's that's a big nut to
 
05:07:08.230 --> 05:07:08.240 align:start position:0%
crack if you will representative cofoult
 
05:07:10.390 --> 05:07:10.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
05:07:12.470 --> 05:07:12.480 align:start position:0%
taking my question so
 
05:07:14.788 --> 05:07:14.798 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned that your primary
 
05:07:16.868 --> 05:07:16.878 align:start position:0%
concern is this sort of bifurcation it's
 
05:07:19.510 --> 05:07:19.520 align:start position:0%
a two two sets of rules so
 
05:07:22.390 --> 05:07:22.400 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm curious to know if
 
05:07:24.868 --> 05:07:24.878 align:start position:0%
if this bill were amended to include an
 
05:07:26.230 --> 05:07:26.240 align:start position:0%
impala like
 
05:07:29.110 --> 05:07:29.120 align:start position:0%
provision or requirement
 
05:07:30.150 --> 05:07:30.160 align:start position:0%
and or
 
05:07:32.480 --> 05:07:32.490 align:start position:0%
if the bill were to
 
05:07:32.490 --> 05:07:34.470 align:start position:0%
if the bill were to
[Music]

05:07:34.470 --> 05:07:34.480 align:start position:0%

uh by these membership-based
organizations

organizations
 
05:07:43.990 --> 05:07:44.000 align:start position:0%
would you still be opposing the bill i
 
05:07:45.990 --> 05:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
would need to see the amendment but
 
05:07:46.000 --> 05:07:47.510 align:start position:0%
would need to see the amendment but
again

05:07:47.510 --> 05:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
again
 
05:07:49.750 --> 05:07:49.760 align:start position:0%
i would worry about how the patient is
 
05:07:52.070 --> 05:07:52.080 align:start position:0%
um impacted um
 
05:07:56.470 --> 05:07:56.480 align:start position:0%
i truly do not know and maybe um
 
05:07:58.470 --> 05:07:58.480 align:start position:0%
someone can help me understand how you
 
05:08:00.708 --> 05:08:00.718 align:start position:0%
could um how you could price this so
 
05:08:03.350 --> 05:08:03.360 align:start position:0%
that it could be affordable
 
05:08:05.910 --> 05:08:05.920 align:start position:0%
and then actually work for a
 
05:08:08.708 --> 05:08:08.718 align:start position:0%
freestanding hospital and to me
 
05:08:11.430 --> 05:08:11.440 align:start position:0%
some of the the discussion sounded to me
 
05:08:13.830 --> 05:08:13.840 align:start position:0%
more like urgent care center that
 
05:08:15.350 --> 05:08:15.360 align:start position:0%

05:08:16.868 --> 05:08:16.878 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of urgent care centers
 
05:08:19.830 --> 05:08:19.840 align:start position:0%
that are not open 24 7. open 24 7 is a
 
05:08:21.990 --> 05:08:22.000 align:start position:0%
different totally different animal
 
05:08:23.510 --> 05:08:23.520 align:start position:0%

individual's current or previous

healthcare provider respectively

the relevant form requires the signature

of the health care provider in addition
 
05:11:53.110 --> 05:11:53.120 align:start position:0%
to the signature of the patient or the

parent or guardian
 
05:11:57.350 --> 05:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
the unanswered question in all this is
 
05:11:58.868 --> 05:11:58.878 align:start position:0%
what happens if the health care provider
 
05:12:00.708 --> 05:12:00.718 align:start position:0%
does not wish to sign the form or is
 
05:12:03.510 --> 05:12:03.520 align:start position:0%

05:12:08.708 --> 05:12:08.718 align:start position:0%
situation
 
05:12:10.550 --> 05:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
is an individual without a primary care
 
05:12:12.310 --> 05:12:12.320 align:start position:0%
provider supposed to track down the most
 
05:12:14.550 --> 05:12:14.560 align:start position:0%
recent pharmacists they saw to get the
 
05:12:17.670 --> 05:12:17.680 align:start position:0%
required counter signature
 
05:12:19.270 --> 05:12:19.280 align:start position:0%
additionally this roadblock to
 
05:12:21.190 --> 05:12:21.200 align:start position:0%
accomplishing the withdrawal is also out
 
05:12:22.628 --> 05:12:22.638 align:start position:0%
of step with the other forms for the
 
05:12:24.470 --> 05:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
vaccine registry
 
05:12:26.230 --> 05:12:26.240 align:start position:0%
neither the form to request a copy of
 
05:12:28.310 --> 05:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
your record from the registry nor the
 
05:12:30.150 --> 05:12:30.160 align:start position:0%
form to make corrections to a registry
 
05:12:31.990 --> 05:12:32.000 align:start position:0%
record requires the counter signature of
 
05:12:34.470 --> 05:12:34.480 align:start position:0%
a healthcare provider
 
05:12:36.310 --> 05:12:36.320 align:start position:0%
they may both be sent directly to the
 
05:12:38.230 --> 05:12:38.240 align:start position:0%
registry administrator
 
05:12:39.830 --> 05:12:39.840 align:start position:0%
despite the forms being developed at the
 
05:12:42.868 --> 05:12:42.878 align:start position:0%
same time in march 2016 only withdrawal
 
05:12:44.628 --> 05:12:44.638 align:start position:0%

05:12:47.830 --> 05:12:47.840 align:start position:0%
this bill seeks to correct that

this bill seeks to correct that

05:12:49.590 --> 05:12:49.600 align:start position:0%
disparity
 
05:12:50.310 --> 05:12:50.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time and
 
05:12:51.990 --> 05:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
consideration i'd be happy to answer any
 
05:12:52.000 --> 05:12:55.110 align:start position:0%
consideration i'd be happy to answer any
questions

05:12:55.110 --> 05:12:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:56.948 --> 05:12:56.958 align:start position:0%
representative leon
 
05:12:58.470 --> 05:12:58.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
05:13:02.470 --> 05:13:02.480 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question um
 
05:13:05.430 --> 05:13:05.440 align:start position:0%
so thanks to covid and healthcare worker
 
05:13:07.830 --> 05:13:07.840 align:start position:0%
shortages my family is without a primary
 
05:13:09.030 --> 05:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
care doctor
 
05:13:12.788 --> 05:13:12.798 align:start position:0%
would your bill make it easier for us to
 
05:13:15.510 --> 05:13:15.520 align:start position:0%
to choose to opt out of that registry it
 
05:13:17.110 --> 05:13:17.120 align:start position:0%
without having to find a new primary
 
05:13:19.510 --> 05:13:19.520 align:start position:0%
care provider to do so
 
05:13:21.430 --> 05:13:21.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um
 
05:13:23.350 --> 05:13:23.360 align:start position:0%
to clarify this isn't about opting out
 
05:13:24.628 --> 05:13:24.638 align:start position:0%
of the registry this is about
 
05:13:26.948 --> 05:13:26.958 align:start position:0%
withdrawing once you're already in it
 
05:13:29.110 --> 05:13:29.120 align:start position:0%
and yes as written today the law and the
 
05:13:30.310 --> 05:13:30.320 align:start position:0%
administrative rules that support it
 
05:13:32.150 --> 05:13:32.160 align:start position:0%
would require you to track down your
 
05:13:34.868 --> 05:13:34.878 align:start position:0%
most recent primary care provider
 
05:13:36.390 --> 05:13:36.400 align:start position:0%
if this bill passes it would direct the
 
05:13:37.510 --> 05:13:37.520 align:start position:0%
department to
 
05:13:39.190 --> 05:13:39.200 align:start position:0%
make a new form that did not have that
 
05:13:39.200 --> 05:13:40.390 align:start position:0%
make a new form that did not have that
requirement

05:13:40.390 --> 05:13:40.400 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
05:13:42.788 --> 05:13:42.798 align:start position:0%
follow-up um
 
05:13:44.788 --> 05:13:44.798 align:start position:0%
and i assume there's no exemptions if
 
05:13:46.708 --> 05:13:46.718 align:start position:0%
the former primary care provider is
 
05:13:46.718 --> 05:13:48.310 align:start position:0%
the former primary care provider is
deceased

05:13:48.310 --> 05:13:48.320 align:start position:0%
deceased
 
05:13:49.590 --> 05:13:49.600 align:start position:0%
there is
 
05:13:51.350 --> 05:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
no mention of the law of what to do in
 
05:13:52.708 --> 05:13:52.718 align:start position:0%
that situation
 
05:13:54.070 --> 05:13:54.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:13:55.430 --> 05:13:55.440 align:start position:0%
any further questions for the
 
05:13:55.440 --> 05:13:58.628 align:start position:0%
any further questions for the
representative

05:13:58.628 --> 05:13:58.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:00.628 --> 05:14:00.638 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you so much
 
05:14:03.030 --> 05:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
and the chair calls dr doug phelan from
 
05:14:05.910 --> 05:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire medical society
 
05:14:07.510 --> 05:14:07.520 align:start position:0%
who is
 
05:14:09.350 --> 05:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
indicating he's in opposition to the
 
05:14:09.360 --> 05:14:17.270 align:start position:0%
indicating he's in opposition to the
bill

05:14:17.270 --> 05:14:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:18.628 --> 05:14:18.638 align:start position:0%
thank you chair thank you committee for
 
05:14:21.750 --> 05:14:21.760 align:start position:0%
having me today doug phelan family
 
05:14:24.230 --> 05:14:24.240 align:start position:0%
physician in bedford new hampshire
 
05:14:25.670 --> 05:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
speaking on behalf of the medical
 
05:14:27.750 --> 05:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
society in opposition of the bill is
 
05:14:27.760 --> 05:14:28.788 align:start position:0%
society in opposition of the bill is
written

05:14:28.788 --> 05:14:28.798 align:start position:0%
written
 
05:14:31.030 --> 05:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
so here's where where i would sort of
 
05:14:33.430 --> 05:14:33.440 align:start position:0%
come down on the registry
 
05:14:34.550 --> 05:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
this is going to consolidate
 
05:14:36.868 --> 05:14:36.878 align:start position:0%
immunizations into one record that's
 
05:14:39.030 --> 05:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
going to be easily accessible quickly
 
05:14:41.990 --> 05:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
available and secure as a resource for
 
05:14:43.510 --> 05:14:43.520 align:start position:0%
providers of all stripes around the
 
05:14:43.520 --> 05:14:44.868 align:start position:0%
providers of all stripes around the
state

05:14:44.868 --> 05:14:44.878 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:14:46.788 --> 05:14:46.798 align:start position:0%
i can tell you numerous times when i was
 
05:14:48.390 --> 05:14:48.400 align:start position:0%
a resident in concord in my current
 
05:14:50.310 --> 05:14:50.320 align:start position:0%
attending practice where i have been on
 
05:14:53.590 --> 05:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
call and an outside medical facility has
 
05:14:56.470 --> 05:14:56.480 align:start position:0%
paged the on-call provider
 
05:14:56.480 --> 05:14:57.830 align:start position:0%
paged the on-call provider
to

05:14:57.830 --> 05:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:14:59.990 --> 05:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
see if somebody is up to date on their
 
05:15:01.910 --> 05:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
immunization maybe they were up in the
 
05:15:03.670 --> 05:15:03.680 align:start position:0%
mountains skiing and they got caught on
 
05:15:05.510 --> 05:15:05.520 align:start position:0%
a nail and they needed to make sure that
 
05:15:07.350 --> 05:15:07.360 align:start position:0%
they were up to date on tetanus and the
 
05:15:09.750 --> 05:15:09.760 align:start position:0%
hospital up there had no way of
 
05:15:12.150 --> 05:15:12.160 align:start position:0%
verifying that information that's just
 
05:15:14.390 --> 05:15:14.400 align:start position:0%
one instance and i know it might sound
 
05:15:16.390 --> 05:15:16.400 align:start position:0%
rare but in all of the different
 
05:15:19.190 --> 05:15:19.200 align:start position:0%
applications and permutations of when
 
05:15:20.788 --> 05:15:20.798 align:start position:0%
somebody might need to check on whether
 
05:15:23.190 --> 05:15:23.200 align:start position:0%
a vaccination is current or not
 
05:15:24.948 --> 05:15:24.958 align:start position:0%
i have not found it to be exceedingly
 
05:15:24.958 --> 05:15:25.910 align:start position:0%
i have not found it to be exceedingly
rare

05:15:25.910 --> 05:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
rare
 
05:15:27.910 --> 05:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
the other thing that i would point to
 
05:15:30.550 --> 05:15:30.560 align:start position:0%
for this the utility of the registry is
 
05:15:33.030 --> 05:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
regarding pediatric patient transfers as
 
05:15:34.708 --> 05:15:34.718 align:start position:0%
a family physician i would love if every
 
05:15:36.628 --> 05:15:36.638 align:start position:0%
patient stayed with their family
 
05:15:38.150 --> 05:15:38.160 align:start position:0%
physician for years and years and years
 
05:15:40.310 --> 05:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
on end but people move
 
05:15:42.550 --> 05:15:42.560 align:start position:0%
and for various reasons change their
 
05:15:45.110 --> 05:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
primary care providers sometimes those
 
05:15:46.708 --> 05:15:46.718 align:start position:0%
records lag
 
05:15:48.550 --> 05:15:48.560 align:start position:0%
and the utility of a central resource
 
05:15:50.470 --> 05:15:50.480 align:start position:0%
for this is important we don't hold
 
05:15:52.070 --> 05:15:52.080 align:start position:0%
patients up from coming in to see their
 
05:15:53.590 --> 05:15:53.600 align:start position:0%
doctor if we haven't received their
 
05:15:56.070 --> 05:15:56.080 align:start position:0%
records yet and not everybody keeps a
 
05:15:58.310 --> 05:15:58.320 align:start position:0%
running tally of the immunizations
 
05:15:59.830 --> 05:15:59.840 align:start position:0%
they've received and what dates upon
 
05:16:01.670 --> 05:16:01.680 align:start position:0%
which they have received them
 
05:16:03.590 --> 05:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
especially for children
 
05:16:05.190 --> 05:16:05.200 align:start position:0%
and so having that type of information
 
05:16:07.670 --> 05:16:07.680 align:start position:0%
at your fingertips is very useful for
 
05:16:09.910 --> 05:16:09.920 align:start position:0%
safe medical care
 
05:16:11.350 --> 05:16:11.360 align:start position:0%
a centralized resource of this
 
05:16:13.350 --> 05:16:13.360 align:start position:0%
information would would make taking good
 
05:16:14.868 --> 05:16:14.878 align:start position:0%
informed care of patients easier for
 
05:16:16.550 --> 05:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
physicians it would be easier for
 
05:16:18.230 --> 05:16:18.240 align:start position:0%
patients and their parents and would
 
05:16:20.070 --> 05:16:20.080 align:start position:0%
also be easier for staff if you can
 
05:16:21.430 --> 05:16:21.440 align:start position:0%
imagine tracking down all of these
 
05:16:24.628 --> 05:16:24.638 align:start position:0%
records adds to that burden
 
05:16:26.150 --> 05:16:26.160 align:start position:0%
having this discussion with patients is
 
05:16:26.160 --> 05:16:27.110 align:start position:0%
having this discussion with patients is
important

05:16:27.110 --> 05:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
important
 
05:16:28.628 --> 05:16:28.638 align:start position:0%
if a patient declines there is not a
 
05:16:30.390 --> 05:16:30.400 align:start position:0%
physician i know who would stand in the
 
05:16:32.070 --> 05:16:32.080 align:start position:0%
way of this this is a primary tenet of
 
05:16:35.190 --> 05:16:35.200 align:start position:0%
medical ethics this is autonomy
 
05:16:37.510 --> 05:16:37.520 align:start position:0%
but doctor comes from the latin docere
 
05:16:39.590 --> 05:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
and this is to teach counseling is a
 
05:16:41.990 --> 05:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
large portion of what we do
 
05:16:43.270 --> 05:16:43.280 align:start position:0%
and so that's a discussion that's
 
05:16:44.788 --> 05:16:44.798 align:start position:0%
critical just like our council on
 
05:16:48.470 --> 05:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:52.550 --> 05:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
to be brief a couple more points
 
05:16:53.990 --> 05:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
health care officials as well as public
 
05:16:55.590 --> 05:16:55.600 align:start position:0%
health departments seem to eliminate
 
05:16:57.990 --> 05:16:58.000 align:start position:0%
disparities in care this can be inside
 
05:16:59.270 --> 05:16:59.280 align:start position:0%
the auspices of an office or a
 
05:17:01.190 --> 05:17:01.200 align:start position:0%
healthcare system or within a city or
 
05:17:01.200 --> 05:17:02.868 align:start position:0%
healthcare system or within a city or
town

05:17:02.868 --> 05:17:02.878 align:start position:0%
town
 
05:17:04.948 --> 05:17:04.958 align:start position:0%
having access to this data helps them
 
05:17:04.958 --> 05:17:06.070 align:start position:0%
having access to this data helps them
target

05:17:06.070 --> 05:17:06.080 align:start position:0%
target
 
05:17:08.150 --> 05:17:08.160 align:start position:0%
those efforts rather than broadly
 
05:17:09.830 --> 05:17:09.840 align:start position:0%
casting a net not knowing what
 
05:17:10.948 --> 05:17:10.958 align:start position:0%
percentage of people have been
 
05:17:12.550 --> 05:17:12.560 align:start position:0%
vaccinated to what and in what area
 
05:17:14.628 --> 05:17:14.638 align:start position:0%
might they be needed
 
05:17:16.868 --> 05:17:16.878 align:start position:0%
lastly most physicians uh i would say
 
05:17:16.878 --> 05:17:17.990 align:start position:0%
lastly most physicians uh i would say
and

05:17:17.990 --> 05:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:17:19.350 --> 05:17:19.360 align:start position:0%
not an expert in this but i would
 
05:17:21.030 --> 05:17:21.040 align:start position:0%
suspect practitioners of all stripes in
 
05:17:22.868 --> 05:17:22.878 align:start position:0%
the state have at one point in their
 
05:17:25.350 --> 05:17:25.360 align:start position:0%
education training trained elsewhere
 
05:17:27.110 --> 05:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
outside of this state
 
05:17:30.150 --> 05:17:30.160 align:start position:0%
this is a very common thing outside of
 
05:17:31.990 --> 05:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
this state it's something that providers
 
05:17:34.070 --> 05:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
and physicians are used to having access
 
05:17:36.868 --> 05:17:36.878 align:start position:0%
to we've been used to working with it
 
05:17:38.948 --> 05:17:38.958 align:start position:0%
in a way to take good care of patients
 
05:17:41.350 --> 05:17:41.360 align:start position:0%
and so that's why having access to that
 
05:17:43.110 --> 05:17:43.120 align:start position:0%
being here in new hampshire it has been
 
05:17:44.788 --> 05:17:44.798 align:start position:0%
different working without one i look
 
05:17:46.310 --> 05:17:46.320 align:start position:0%
forward to the opportunity of working
 
05:17:47.430 --> 05:17:47.440 align:start position:0%
with one
 
05:17:48.470 --> 05:17:48.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:17:51.030 --> 05:17:51.040 align:start position:0%
any questions for the doctor
 
05:17:53.910 --> 05:17:53.920 align:start position:0%
representative cushman
 
05:17:55.510 --> 05:17:55.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
05:17:57.990 --> 05:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question doctor
 
05:18:00.390 --> 05:18:00.400 align:start position:0%
i'm a little confused because this bill
 
05:18:02.070 --> 05:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
is not a repeal
 
05:18:04.948 --> 05:18:04.958 align:start position:0%
the vaccine vaccine registry bill this
 
05:18:06.550 --> 05:18:06.560 align:start position:0%
is to allow
 
05:18:08.390 --> 05:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
easy withdrawal
 
05:18:11.270 --> 05:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
of private health information
 
05:18:16.230 --> 05:18:16.240 align:start position:0%
by a patient or a parent or guardian
 
05:18:18.390 --> 05:18:18.400 align:start position:0%
just without having to go through
 
05:18:20.070 --> 05:18:20.080 align:start position:0%
a doctor and get a doctor's permission
 
05:18:22.150 --> 05:18:22.160 align:start position:0%
to have their privacy
 
05:18:24.470 --> 05:18:24.480 align:start position:0%
do you understand i do understand thank
 
05:18:24.480 --> 05:18:25.350 align:start position:0%
do you understand i do understand thank
you

05:18:25.350 --> 05:18:25.360 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:18:27.110 --> 05:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
i believe the testimony that i gave
 
05:18:30.150 --> 05:18:30.160 align:start position:0%
still in large aspect applies to that
 
05:18:32.628 --> 05:18:32.638 align:start position:0%
because of the importance of that
 
05:18:34.470 --> 05:18:34.480 align:start position:0%
conversation with the patient with the
 
05:18:34.480 --> 05:18:35.430 align:start position:0%
conversation with the patient with the
family

05:18:35.430 --> 05:18:35.440 align:start position:0%
family
 
05:18:38.070 --> 05:18:38.080 align:start position:0%
about the registry and the details sort
 
05:18:39.510 --> 05:18:39.520 align:start position:0%
of going back to that importance and
 
05:18:41.590 --> 05:18:41.600 align:start position:0%
primacy of the provider-patient
 
05:18:44.948 --> 05:18:44.958 align:start position:0%
relationship and having that discussion
 
05:18:49.190 --> 05:18:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:51.430 --> 05:18:51.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you dr
 
05:18:53.030 --> 05:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
fellow taking my question
 
05:18:55.110 --> 05:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
we pride ourselves here in new hampshire
 
05:18:56.470 --> 05:18:56.480 align:start position:0%
being in a state with a lot of tourists
 
05:18:58.390 --> 05:18:58.400 align:start position:0%
that come into our state we're fortunate
 
05:19:02.788 --> 05:19:02.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:04.550 --> 05:19:04.560 align:start position:0%
in saying that
 
05:19:06.708 --> 05:19:06.718 align:start position:0%
as a physician in the er i totally
 
05:19:09.030 --> 05:19:09.040 align:start position:0%
understand the access to the database
 
05:19:11.030 --> 05:19:11.040 align:start position:0%
and the importance it plays
 
05:19:11.040 --> 05:19:12.470 align:start position:0%
and the importance it plays
however

05:19:12.470 --> 05:19:12.480 align:start position:0%
however
 
05:19:14.390 --> 05:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
when you have a patient coming from
 
05:19:16.150 --> 05:19:16.160 align:start position:0%
massachusetts or maine or some other
 
05:19:16.160 --> 05:19:17.270 align:start position:0%
massachusetts or maine or some other
state

05:19:17.270 --> 05:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:19:18.788 --> 05:19:18.798 align:start position:0%
is there information in that vaccine
 
05:19:18.798 --> 05:19:20.470 align:start position:0%
is there information in that vaccine
registry

05:19:20.470 --> 05:19:20.480 align:start position:0%
registry
 
05:19:23.670 --> 05:19:23.680 align:start position:0%
not to my knowledge no so what do you do
 
05:19:25.110 --> 05:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
you do your best
 
05:19:26.390 --> 05:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
you rely on the information that you
 
05:19:27.990 --> 05:19:28.000 align:start position:0%
have at hand and you make a decision
 
05:19:29.670 --> 05:19:29.680 align:start position:0%
informed with the patient is that also
 
05:19:32.150 --> 05:19:32.160 align:start position:0%
true sorry
 
05:19:34.070 --> 05:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
follow up that also true for children
 
05:19:37.430 --> 05:19:37.440 align:start position:0%
who are pity who come here um with their
 
05:19:39.270 --> 05:19:39.280 align:start position:0%
parents who are mobile
 
05:19:41.270 --> 05:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
that again if they're all the vaccines
 
05:19:43.510 --> 05:19:43.520 align:start position:0%
are in another state registry that's not
 
05:19:45.990 --> 05:19:46.000 align:start position:0%
going to be in our state registry either
 
05:19:47.270 --> 05:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
that's correct the state registries
 
05:19:48.470 --> 05:19:48.480 align:start position:0%
would be separate thank you for the
 
05:19:48.480 --> 05:19:49.910 align:start position:0%
would be separate thank you for the
clarification

05:19:49.910 --> 05:19:49.920 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
05:19:57.270 --> 05:19:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:59.350 --> 05:19:59.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
05:20:00.708 --> 05:20:00.718 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
05:20:00.718 --> 05:20:02.230 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

05:20:02.230 --> 05:20:02.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:20:02.240 --> 05:20:03.430 align:start position:0%
um
so

05:20:03.430 --> 05:20:03.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:20:07.110 --> 05:20:07.120 align:start position:0%
once once a patient has a discussion
 
05:20:10.628 --> 05:20:10.638 align:start position:0%
in regards to the registry
 
05:20:12.390 --> 05:20:12.400 align:start position:0%
and then they have the information
 
05:20:15.990 --> 05:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
necessary to make an informed decision
 
05:20:17.510 --> 05:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
don't they have the
 
05:20:19.510 --> 05:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
right shouldn't they have the right to
 
05:20:21.030 --> 05:20:21.040 align:start position:0%
decide i mean
 
05:20:23.110 --> 05:20:23.120 align:start position:0%
it would it would make sense to me that
 
05:20:25.110 --> 05:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
if a person
 
05:20:28.070 --> 05:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
if that's a person's right
 
05:20:30.230 --> 05:20:30.240 align:start position:0%
you seem to want to
 
05:20:32.628 --> 05:20:32.638 align:start position:0%
sort of squelch that and i want to know
 
05:20:32.638 --> 05:20:33.590 align:start position:0%
sort of squelch that and i want to know
why

05:20:33.590 --> 05:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
why
 
05:20:40.390 --> 05:20:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:41.990 --> 05:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
the last part through me
 
05:20:44.548 --> 05:20:44.558 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry the uh making a decision
 
05:20:46.390 --> 05:20:46.400 align:start position:0%
making an informed decision is
 
05:20:48.230 --> 05:20:48.240 align:start position:0%
pro-choice and and having the
 
05:20:49.910 --> 05:20:49.920 align:start position:0%
information from
 
05:20:54.868 --> 05:20:54.878 align:start position:0%
you let's say in regards to the registry
 
05:20:56.628 --> 05:20:56.638 align:start position:0%
should allow
 
05:21:00.230 --> 05:21:00.240 align:start position:0%
your patient to have that
 
05:21:01.910 --> 05:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
decision-making right
 
05:21:04.628 --> 05:21:04.638 align:start position:0%
i would say in this instance
 
05:21:07.030 --> 05:21:07.040 align:start position:0%
the the effect of even this conversation
 
05:21:09.270 --> 05:21:09.280 align:start position:0%
of the introduction of this bill of the
 
05:21:11.750 --> 05:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
discussion and deliberation of this bill
 
05:21:14.390 --> 05:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
is a sign that this issue is complex
 
05:21:16.948 --> 05:21:16.958 align:start position:0%
this takes conversation and deliberation
 
05:21:19.670 --> 05:21:19.680 align:start position:0%
i come from
 
05:21:21.430 --> 05:21:21.440 align:start position:0%
a long history and school of medical
 
05:21:23.590 --> 05:21:23.600 align:start position:0%
thought that the relationship between a
 
05:21:25.190 --> 05:21:25.200 align:start position:0%
provider and their patient in my case a
 
05:21:26.868 --> 05:21:26.878 align:start position:0%
physician and the patient
 
05:21:29.190 --> 05:21:29.200 align:start position:0%
um is is
 
05:21:31.350 --> 05:21:31.360 align:start position:0%
the premises is of the top preserving
 
05:21:32.948 --> 05:21:32.958 align:start position:0%
that relationship
 
05:21:33.990 --> 05:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
i want to continue to have that
 
05:21:35.750 --> 05:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
relationship and discuss with patients
 
05:21:37.750 --> 05:21:37.760 align:start position:0%
it's not a matter of standing between as
 
05:21:39.430 --> 05:21:39.440 align:start position:0%
a barrier it's a matter of having an
 
05:21:42.230 --> 05:21:42.240 align:start position:0%
informed conversation
 
05:21:42.240 --> 05:21:44.788 align:start position:0%
informed conversation
follow-up

05:21:44.788 --> 05:21:44.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:46.390 --> 05:21:46.400 align:start position:0%
and then after having that discussion
 
05:21:47.990 --> 05:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
don't you believe that your patient has
 
05:21:49.990 --> 05:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
the right to decide whether or not they
 
05:21:51.350 --> 05:21:51.360 align:start position:0%
want to
 
05:21:54.470 --> 05:21:54.480 align:start position:0%
go ahead with whatever procedure or or
 
05:21:56.948 --> 05:21:56.958 align:start position:0%
in this particular case withdrawing from
 
05:21:59.990 --> 05:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
the registry don't they have that right
 
05:22:01.430 --> 05:22:01.440 align:start position:0%
yes and we would do that right there on
 
05:22:03.190 --> 05:22:03.200 align:start position:0%
the spot if that was their wish thank
 
05:22:03.200 --> 05:22:04.310 align:start position:0%
the spot if that was their wish thank
you

05:22:04.310 --> 05:22:04.320 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:22:06.310 --> 05:22:06.320 align:start position:0%
representative leon
 
05:22:07.910 --> 05:22:07.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
05:22:09.670 --> 05:22:09.680 align:start position:0%
being here to answer questions
 
05:22:11.910 --> 05:22:11.920 align:start position:0%
especially as a family practice doctor
 
05:22:13.910 --> 05:22:13.920 align:start position:0%
um i have a question and a follow-up how
 
05:22:15.430 --> 05:22:15.440 align:start position:0%
long would that counseling about
 
05:22:17.990 --> 05:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
withdrawing from the vaccine registry
 
05:22:21.030 --> 05:22:21.040 align:start position:0%
take do you think
 
05:22:23.590 --> 05:22:23.600 align:start position:0%
estimates it could be as short as a
 
05:22:25.270 --> 05:22:25.280 align:start position:0%
minute and it could be as long as 10
 
05:22:25.280 --> 05:22:26.230 align:start position:0%
minute and it could be as long as 10
minutes

05:22:26.230 --> 05:22:26.240 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
05:22:26.240 --> 05:22:27.430 align:start position:0%
minutes
estimating

05:22:27.430 --> 05:22:27.440 align:start position:0%
estimating
 
05:22:29.670 --> 05:22:29.680 align:start position:0%
then as a follow-up would you suggest
 
05:22:31.750 --> 05:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
scheduling an entirely separate
 
05:22:33.430 --> 05:22:33.440 align:start position:0%
appointment in order to make sure that
 
05:22:34.788 --> 05:22:34.798 align:start position:0%
it has enough time and it doesn't take
 
05:22:36.390 --> 05:22:36.400 align:start position:0%
away from other care in another
 
05:22:36.400 --> 05:22:38.548 align:start position:0%
away from other care in another
appointment

05:22:38.548 --> 05:22:38.558 align:start position:0%
appointment
 
05:22:40.070 --> 05:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of
 
05:22:42.150 --> 05:22:42.160 align:start position:0%
complexity to that i try to save my
 
05:22:44.070 --> 05:22:44.080 align:start position:0%
patients visits wherever possible and
 
05:22:45.830 --> 05:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
try being cognizant that people are
 
05:22:47.350 --> 05:22:47.360 align:start position:0%
working taking time off to come in for a
 
05:22:49.030 --> 05:22:49.040 align:start position:0%
medical visit so i would try to
 
05:22:50.788 --> 05:22:50.798 align:start position:0%
incorporate it into a visit
 
05:22:52.948 --> 05:22:52.958 align:start position:0%
but it would understandably have enough
 
05:22:55.430 --> 05:22:55.440 align:start position:0%
complexity to stand on its own
 
05:22:57.260 --> 05:22:57.270 align:start position:0%
what's the billing code
 
05:22:57.270 --> 05:22:58.788 align:start position:0%
what's the billing code
[Laughter]

05:22:58.788 --> 05:22:58.798 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
05:23:00.390 --> 05:23:00.400 align:start position:0%
i have to ask you
 
05:23:02.070 --> 05:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
oh boy that was not one i was
 
05:23:02.080 --> 05:23:03.590 align:start position:0%
oh boy that was not one i was
anticipating

05:23:03.590 --> 05:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
anticipating
 
05:23:05.110 --> 05:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
i'm pretty sure there's a code in there
 
05:23:07.270 --> 05:23:07.280 align:start position:0%
for counseling on preventive care i
 
05:23:09.510 --> 05:23:09.520 align:start position:0%
believe there is
 
05:23:11.990 --> 05:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
i supervise our billing person so there
 
05:23:13.910 --> 05:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
it is uh did i see representative
 
05:23:15.990 --> 05:23:16.000 align:start position:0%
soloway yes and then connect sorry uh
 
05:23:18.548 --> 05:23:18.558 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh and uh thank
 
05:23:20.788 --> 05:23:20.798 align:start position:0%
you dr phelan for taking my question uh
 
05:23:23.110 --> 05:23:23.120 align:start position:0%
just a quick question we have we're
 
05:23:24.470 --> 05:23:24.480 align:start position:0%
having a lot of discussion in this
 
05:23:27.670 --> 05:23:27.680 align:start position:0%
committee about opt-in opt-out
 
05:23:27.680 --> 05:23:28.548 align:start position:0%
committee about opt-in opt-out
on

05:23:28.548 --> 05:23:28.558 align:start position:0%
on
 
05:23:28.558 --> 05:23:29.910 align:start position:0%
on
immunization

05:23:29.910 --> 05:23:29.920 align:start position:0%
immunization
 
05:23:32.628 --> 05:23:32.638 align:start position:0%
databases generally
 
05:23:32.638 --> 05:23:33.750 align:start position:0%
databases generally
and

05:23:33.750 --> 05:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:23:36.150 --> 05:23:36.160 align:start position:0%
can you draw for us the distinction
 
05:23:36.160 --> 05:23:37.430 align:start position:0%
can you draw for us the distinction
between

05:23:37.430 --> 05:23:37.440 align:start position:0%
between
 
05:23:40.390 --> 05:23:40.400 align:start position:0%
a public health database
 
05:23:43.430 --> 05:23:43.440 align:start position:0%
and a clinical database centered on
 
05:23:43.440 --> 05:23:45.990 align:start position:0%
and a clinical database centered on
patients

05:23:45.990 --> 05:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:47.430 --> 05:23:47.440 align:start position:0%
it's a hard
 
05:23:50.868 --> 05:23:50.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:54.470 --> 05:23:54.480 align:start position:0%
in terms of the use the practical use
 
05:23:56.788 --> 05:23:56.798 align:start position:0%
in terms of public health sort of i kind
 
05:23:58.948 --> 05:23:58.958 align:start position:0%
of glancingly referenced it at the end
 
05:24:00.310 --> 05:24:00.320 align:start position:0%
but it's in
 
05:24:02.230 --> 05:24:02.240 align:start position:0%
the interest of public health
 
05:24:05.510 --> 05:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
departments of public health at large
 
05:24:07.670 --> 05:24:07.680 align:start position:0%
of which we often end up blurring the
 
05:24:10.230 --> 05:24:10.240 align:start position:0%
lines in primary care but
 
05:24:10.240 --> 05:24:11.030 align:start position:0%
lines in primary care but
to

05:24:11.030 --> 05:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:24:14.070 --> 05:24:14.080 align:start position:0%
be able to look at a population and see
 
05:24:16.708 --> 05:24:16.718 align:start position:0%
what level of vaccination is here for
 
05:24:18.948 --> 05:24:18.958 align:start position:0%
this if there is an outbreak of a
 
05:24:22.150 --> 05:24:22.160 align:start position:0%
communicable disease if there is a if
 
05:24:23.990 --> 05:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
there are resources that are available
 
05:24:25.750 --> 05:24:25.760 align:start position:0%
to increase vaccination rates to know an
 
05:24:27.030 --> 05:24:27.040 align:start position:0%
accurate percentage so that's on a
 
05:24:28.868 --> 05:24:28.878 align:start position:0%
population level on a clinical care
 
05:24:30.150 --> 05:24:30.160 align:start position:0%
based level that's more like what i was
 
05:24:32.628 --> 05:24:32.638 align:start position:0%
referring to as far as that er
 
05:24:35.670 --> 05:24:35.680 align:start position:0%
pages me and says i have patient smith
 
05:24:35.680 --> 05:24:36.548 align:start position:0%
pages me and says i have patient smith
here

05:24:36.548 --> 05:24:36.558 align:start position:0%
here
 
05:24:37.750 --> 05:24:37.760 align:start position:0%
uh can you tell me about their
 
05:24:40.628 --> 05:24:40.638 align:start position:0%
vaccination status
 
05:24:42.470 --> 05:24:42.480 align:start position:0%
representative canuck
 
05:24:44.310 --> 05:24:44.320 align:start position:0%
thank you very much so just to clarify
 
05:24:45.510 --> 05:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
because we were talking about that if
 
05:24:47.590 --> 05:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
the patient still wishes to withdraw you
 
05:24:49.430 --> 05:24:49.440 align:start position:0%
of course would sign it
 
05:24:51.670 --> 05:24:51.680 align:start position:0%
so would you agree that the signature is
 
05:24:54.548 --> 05:24:54.558 align:start position:0%
really basically the documentation
 
05:24:56.948 --> 05:24:56.958 align:start position:0%
of the informed consent discussion just
 
05:24:58.390 --> 05:24:58.400 align:start position:0%
as we would do if we do any other
 
05:24:59.910 --> 05:24:59.920 align:start position:0%
informed consent discussion like for
 
05:25:01.350 --> 05:25:01.360 align:start position:0%
surgery we have a signature that
 
05:25:04.070 --> 05:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
documents we had that discussion and
 
05:25:06.310 --> 05:25:06.320 align:start position:0%
that that might also be helpful in terms
 
05:25:08.390 --> 05:25:08.400 align:start position:0%
of any liability issues for example if
 
05:25:09.990 --> 05:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
the provider
 
05:25:12.150 --> 05:25:12.160 align:start position:0%
were not aware that the person withdrawn
 
05:25:14.070 --> 05:25:14.080 align:start position:0%
and they released information they might
 
05:25:15.830 --> 05:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
be held liable because they weren't even
 
05:25:19.590 --> 05:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
aware that the patient withdrawn or
 
05:25:21.670 --> 05:25:21.680 align:start position:0%
let's leave it at that so would you
 
05:25:23.190 --> 05:25:23.200 align:start position:0%
agree that it's important to be able to
 
05:25:25.670 --> 05:25:25.680 align:start position:0%
number one document the discussion and
 
05:25:27.510 --> 05:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
to that that might help with liability
 
05:25:29.670 --> 05:25:29.680 align:start position:0%
issues as well for the provider i would
 
05:25:33.990 --> 05:25:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:36.230 --> 05:25:36.240 align:start position:0%
betty uh i'm i really am sorry
 
05:25:39.110 --> 05:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
representative that is my name it's okay
 
05:25:42.310 --> 05:25:42.320 align:start position:0%
okay okay thank you very much thank you
 
05:25:44.548 --> 05:25:44.558 align:start position:0%
do you admit that it could for people
 
05:25:44.558 --> 05:25:46.788 align:start position:0%
do you admit that it could for people
who

05:25:46.788 --> 05:25:46.798 align:start position:0%
who
 
05:25:49.670 --> 05:25:49.680 align:start position:0%
realized they could opt out after they
 
05:25:52.948 --> 05:25:52.958 align:start position:0%
had the vaccination do you agree that it
 
05:25:55.270 --> 05:25:55.280 align:start position:0%
would be extremely difficult if you no
 
05:25:58.470 --> 05:25:58.480 align:start position:0%
longer had that provider
 
05:26:00.070 --> 05:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
i think there would be a level of
 
05:26:01.670 --> 05:26:01.680 align:start position:0%
difficulty obviously like i said
 
05:26:05.110 --> 05:26:05.120 align:start position:0%
providers move providers retire um
 
05:26:07.270 --> 05:26:07.280 align:start position:0%
but i think leaving the freedom for
 
05:26:10.470 --> 05:26:10.480 align:start position:0%
that discussion to be with a provider
 
05:26:13.030 --> 05:26:13.040 align:start position:0%
still stands and there are
 
05:26:16.948 --> 05:26:16.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:16.958 --> 05:26:20.948 align:start position:0%
 
representative

05:26:20.948 --> 05:26:20.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:20.958 --> 05:26:24.708 align:start position:0%
 
weber

05:26:24.708 --> 05:26:24.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:27.510 --> 05:26:27.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
05:26:30.070 --> 05:26:30.080 align:start position:0%
so i guess i'm a little confused and
 
05:26:32.548 --> 05:26:32.558 align:start position:0%
maybe it's a follow-up to a question i
 
05:26:34.070 --> 05:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
heard earlier
 
05:26:34.080 --> 05:26:35.030 align:start position:0%
heard earlier
um

05:26:35.030 --> 05:26:35.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:26:37.510 --> 05:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
if somebody got their
 
05:26:40.150 --> 05:26:40.160 align:start position:0%
covet vaccine
 
05:26:44.310 --> 05:26:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:47.910 --> 05:26:47.920 align:start position:0%
facility that isn't there anymore
 
05:26:50.150 --> 05:26:50.160 align:start position:0%
and they don't currently have a primary
 
05:26:52.708 --> 05:26:52.718 align:start position:0%
care provider
 
05:26:54.868 --> 05:26:54.878 align:start position:0%
how do and they want to get that
 
05:26:57.350 --> 05:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
information taken out of the registry
 
05:27:00.628 --> 05:27:00.638 align:start position:0%
for whatever their reasons are
 
05:27:03.430 --> 05:27:03.440 align:start position:0%
how do they do that
 
05:27:05.190 --> 05:27:05.200 align:start position:0%
that's a very good question i would
 
05:27:06.708 --> 05:27:06.718 align:start position:0%
reference the importance and i would
 
05:27:09.190 --> 05:27:09.200 align:start position:0%
sort of share from representative knicks
 
05:27:11.590 --> 05:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
comments that there's an importance to
 
05:27:13.750 --> 05:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
the discussion that is to be had so if
 
05:27:15.430 --> 05:27:15.440 align:start position:0%
there's not a primary care physician
 
05:27:17.350 --> 05:27:17.360 align:start position:0%
involved if that patient that
 
05:27:19.030 --> 05:27:19.040 align:start position:0%
theoretical patient
 
05:27:21.350 --> 05:27:21.360 align:start position:0%
got a cut and needed an antibiotic who
 
05:27:22.788 --> 05:27:22.798 align:start position:0%
would they see
 
05:27:24.470 --> 05:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
they might go to an urgent care they
 
05:27:26.548 --> 05:27:26.558 align:start position:0%
might find a new primary care
 
05:27:29.270 --> 05:27:29.280 align:start position:0%
physician or provider
 
05:27:31.430 --> 05:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
that discussion could be had with a
 
05:27:33.110 --> 05:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
licensed medical practitioner within the
 
05:27:33.120 --> 05:27:38.150 align:start position:0%
licensed medical practitioner within the
state

05:27:38.150 --> 05:27:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:39.910 --> 05:27:39.920 align:start position:0%
representative folsom
 
05:27:41.270 --> 05:27:41.280 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman thank you for taking
 
05:27:42.548 --> 05:27:42.558 align:start position:0%
my question
 
05:27:45.110 --> 05:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
um if someone does not have a primary
 
05:27:48.150 --> 05:27:48.160 align:start position:0%
care because of the similar situation
 
05:27:51.350 --> 05:27:51.360 align:start position:0%
and they call up a primary care office
 
05:27:52.390 --> 05:27:52.400 align:start position:0%
they're going to have to make an
 
05:27:54.868 --> 05:27:54.878 align:start position:0%
appointment if they don't have insurance
 
05:27:57.110 --> 05:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
they're probably out a minimum of a
 
05:27:59.190 --> 05:27:59.200 align:start position:0%
hundred and forty dollars just to get
 
05:28:01.350 --> 05:28:01.360 align:start position:0%
that doctor's signature
 
05:28:05.350 --> 05:28:05.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:07.830 --> 05:28:07.840 align:start position:0%
would that be an appropriate way to
 
05:28:10.390 --> 05:28:10.400 align:start position:0%
handle that
 
05:28:12.628 --> 05:28:12.638 align:start position:0%
i think again sort of relying on the
 
05:28:14.310 --> 05:28:14.320 align:start position:0%
importance of that discussion in the
 
05:28:16.708 --> 05:28:16.718 align:start position:0%
same way that if that patient needed an
 
05:28:18.230 --> 05:28:18.240 align:start position:0%
antibiotic because they were getting
 
05:28:20.310 --> 05:28:20.320 align:start position:0%
cellulitis from a cut the importance of
 
05:28:22.150 --> 05:28:22.160 align:start position:0%
having that shared communication with a
 
05:28:23.670 --> 05:28:23.680 align:start position:0%
medical provider
 
05:28:23.680 --> 05:28:24.788 align:start position:0%
medical provider
is

05:28:24.788 --> 05:28:24.798 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:28:26.708 --> 05:28:26.718 align:start position:0%
similar in this case
 
05:28:28.470 --> 05:28:28.480 align:start position:0%
so i would
 
05:28:30.070 --> 05:28:30.080 align:start position:0%
sort of dispute some of the cost i think
 
05:28:32.470 --> 05:28:32.480 align:start position:0%
there's ways around that
 
05:28:34.788 --> 05:28:34.798 align:start position:0%
and in obtaining affordable medical care
 
05:28:36.548 --> 05:28:36.558 align:start position:0%
or crisis medical care
 
05:28:36.558 --> 05:28:37.830 align:start position:0%
or crisis medical care
but

05:28:37.830 --> 05:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:28:39.670 --> 05:28:39.680 align:start position:0%
the sort of underlying premise of that
 
05:28:42.708 --> 05:28:42.718 align:start position:0%
relationship between a patient and a
 
05:28:46.310 --> 05:28:46.320 align:start position:0%
provider i think stance
 
05:28:48.470 --> 05:28:48.480 align:start position:0%
representative kelsey
 
05:28:50.390 --> 05:28:50.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
05:28:52.708 --> 05:28:52.718 align:start position:0%
taking my question um does it have to be
 
05:28:55.510 --> 05:28:55.520 align:start position:0%
a new hampshire provider what if i got a
 
05:28:57.750 --> 05:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
vaccination and then i've since moved
 
05:29:00.390 --> 05:29:00.400 align:start position:0%
out of state and then i i don't want my
 
05:29:02.708 --> 05:29:02.718 align:start position:0%
information to be in the database
 
05:29:05.190 --> 05:29:05.200 align:start position:0%
anymore how would i go about
 
05:29:09.030 --> 05:29:09.040 align:start position:0%
getting my information removed
 
05:29:10.390 --> 05:29:10.400 align:start position:0%
that's a good question
 
05:29:10.400 --> 05:29:11.590 align:start position:0%
that's a good question
not

05:29:11.590 --> 05:29:11.600 align:start position:0%
not
 
05:29:13.190 --> 05:29:13.200 align:start position:0%
sort of handling the administration of
 
05:29:16.548 --> 05:29:16.558 align:start position:0%
dhhs myself maybe they have a way for
 
05:29:19.030 --> 05:29:19.040 align:start position:0%
navigating that i think in my
 
05:29:20.868 --> 05:29:20.878 align:start position:0%
recollection of the language right now
 
05:29:23.030 --> 05:29:23.040 align:start position:0%
from the top of my head
 
05:29:25.270 --> 05:29:25.280 align:start position:0%
getting in contact with the old provider
 
05:29:27.270 --> 05:29:27.280 align:start position:0%
from new hampshire who
 
05:29:29.190 --> 05:29:29.200 align:start position:0%
theoretically if that person that you
 
05:29:30.948 --> 05:29:30.958 align:start position:0%
left and went out of state for also had
 
05:29:32.788 --> 05:29:32.798 align:start position:0%
not retired
 
05:29:34.230 --> 05:29:34.240 align:start position:0%
or if there was a covering provider in
 
05:29:35.910 --> 05:29:35.920 align:start position:0%
the office to have that discussion with
 
05:29:38.548 --> 05:29:38.558 align:start position:0%
i think that might be one option but
 
05:29:40.150 --> 05:29:40.160 align:start position:0%
i would defer that question to the
 
05:29:45.670 --> 05:29:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:49.350 --> 05:29:49.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:51.270 --> 05:29:51.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman also thank you dr
 
05:29:53.190 --> 05:29:53.200 align:start position:0%
phelan for taking the question
 
05:29:55.910 --> 05:29:55.920 align:start position:0%
in regards to
 
05:29:58.470 --> 05:29:58.480 align:start position:0%
what i'm trying to understand is
 
05:30:00.150 --> 05:30:00.160 align:start position:0%
the role of a patient in their care
 
05:30:02.150 --> 05:30:02.160 align:start position:0%
versus the role of the physician
 
05:30:03.670 --> 05:30:03.680 align:start position:0%
and i'm sort of getting confused here
 
05:30:05.110 --> 05:30:05.120 align:start position:0%
because it sounds like everything the
 
05:30:06.470 --> 05:30:06.480 align:start position:0%
patient should do for healthcare should
 
05:30:07.990 --> 05:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
go through the provider
 
05:30:09.270 --> 05:30:09.280 align:start position:0%
i don't think that's what we're hearing
 
05:30:10.310 --> 05:30:10.320 align:start position:0%
at least i think that's what we're
 
05:30:11.990 --> 05:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
hearing because there's a lot of times
 
05:30:13.670 --> 05:30:13.680 align:start position:0%
in which a patient
 
05:30:15.030 --> 05:30:15.040 align:start position:0%
should take control over their
 
05:30:17.910 --> 05:30:17.920 align:start position:0%
healthcare themselves directly
 
05:30:20.150 --> 05:30:20.160 align:start position:0%
otherwise really bog down the system
 
05:30:21.590 --> 05:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
because right now my understanding is we
 
05:30:23.190 --> 05:30:23.200 align:start position:0%
don't have enough healthcare providers
 
05:30:25.350 --> 05:30:25.360 align:start position:0%
as it is and the time is extremely
 
05:30:25.360 --> 05:30:26.788 align:start position:0%
as it is and the time is extremely
valuable

05:30:26.788 --> 05:30:26.798 align:start position:0%
valuable
 
05:30:28.708 --> 05:30:28.718 align:start position:0%
so i'm trying to wrestle with the issue
 
05:30:28.718 --> 05:30:29.430 align:start position:0%
so i'm trying to wrestle with the issue
of

05:30:29.430 --> 05:30:29.440 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:30:31.350 --> 05:30:31.360 align:start position:0%
patient-centered care that they control
 
05:30:33.030 --> 05:30:33.040 align:start position:0%
themselves versus something which
 
05:30:35.030 --> 05:30:35.040 align:start position:0%
requires the medical professional to
 
05:30:36.230 --> 05:30:36.240 align:start position:0%
help them and i'm not sure with a
 
05:30:38.548 --> 05:30:38.558 align:start position:0%
vaccine withdrawal qualifies at that
 
05:30:39.670 --> 05:30:39.680 align:start position:0%
level can you help me understand that
 
05:30:39.680 --> 05:30:41.350 align:start position:0%
level can you help me understand that
please

05:30:41.350 --> 05:30:41.360 align:start position:0%
please
 
05:30:41.360 --> 05:30:42.230 align:start position:0%
please
sure

05:30:42.230 --> 05:30:42.240 align:start position:0%
sure
 
05:30:42.240 --> 05:30:43.110 align:start position:0%
sure
so

05:30:43.110 --> 05:30:43.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:30:45.190 --> 05:30:45.200 align:start position:0%
i think for a lot of the instances which
 
05:30:47.430 --> 05:30:47.440 align:start position:0%
uh we've sort of alluded to through some
 
05:30:48.708 --> 05:30:48.718 align:start position:0%
of the sort of questions and answers
 
05:30:50.310 --> 05:30:50.320 align:start position:0%
here that i've given there are many
 
05:30:52.070 --> 05:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
different circumstances where having
 
05:30:54.310 --> 05:30:54.320 align:start position:0%
access to that database is helpful for
 
05:30:55.590 --> 05:30:55.600 align:start position:0%
medical care
 
05:30:57.190 --> 05:30:57.200 align:start position:0%
i think that is in an acute sense i
 
05:30:58.788 --> 05:30:58.798 align:start position:0%
think that is in a preventive sense i
 
05:31:00.150 --> 05:31:00.160 align:start position:0%
think that is for adult medicine i think
 
05:31:02.390 --> 05:31:02.400 align:start position:0%
that's for pediatric medicine
 
05:31:04.150 --> 05:31:04.160 align:start position:0%
because of the breadth and scope of this
 
05:31:06.150 --> 05:31:06.160 align:start position:0%
because of the potential impact of
 
05:31:07.590 --> 05:31:07.600 align:start position:0%
opting out
 
05:31:09.590 --> 05:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
personally as a family physician i would
 
05:31:11.430 --> 05:31:11.440 align:start position:0%
spend the time on that i think the time
 
05:31:13.590 --> 05:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
on that is important i think that's
 
05:31:15.510 --> 05:31:15.520 align:start position:0%
up for consideration here
 
05:31:17.750 --> 05:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
but uh from a medical standpoint and
 
05:31:19.830 --> 05:31:19.840 align:start position:0%
from a primary care standpoint those
 
05:31:21.590 --> 05:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
conversations are amongst the most
 
05:31:25.990 --> 05:31:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:27.910 --> 05:31:27.920 align:start position:0%

human services
 
05:32:16.070 --> 05:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for allowing us to
 
05:32:17.350 --> 05:32:17.360 align:start position:0%
speak today
 
05:32:19.670 --> 05:32:19.680 align:start position:0%
just as a little bit of a recap
 
05:32:22.628 --> 05:32:22.638 align:start position:0%
immunization the iis immunization
 
05:32:24.390 --> 05:32:24.400 align:start position:0%
information systems are the confidential
 
05:32:26.230 --> 05:32:26.240 align:start position:0%
secure population
 
05:32:28.310 --> 05:32:28.320 align:start position:0%
based systems
 
05:32:31.190 --> 05:32:31.200 align:start position:0%
that record critical immunizations they
 
05:32:32.390 --> 05:32:32.400 align:start position:0%
have many benefits
 
05:32:34.948 --> 05:32:34.958 align:start position:0%
by preventing the administration of
 
05:32:36.788 --> 05:32:36.798 align:start position:0%
duplicate immunizations
 
05:32:38.390 --> 05:32:38.400 align:start position:0%
increasing the immunization rates
 
05:32:40.390 --> 05:32:40.400 align:start position:0%
consolidating immunization records and
 
05:32:40.400 --> 05:32:41.430 align:start position:0%
consolidating immunization records and
ensuring

05:32:41.430 --> 05:32:41.440 align:start position:0%
ensuring
 
05:32:43.830 --> 05:32:43.840 align:start position:0%
accountability of publicly purchased
 
05:32:43.840 --> 05:32:45.350 align:start position:0%
accountability of publicly purchased
vaccines

05:32:45.350 --> 05:32:45.360 align:start position:0%
vaccines
 
05:32:48.628 --> 05:32:48.638 align:start position:0%
as we had discussed on prior testimony
 
05:32:50.230 --> 05:32:50.240 align:start position:0%
only providers who administer the
 
05:32:52.150 --> 05:32:52.160 align:start position:0%
publicly funded vaccine are required to
 
05:32:54.628 --> 05:32:54.638 align:start position:0%
report to the immunization
 
05:32:56.628 --> 05:32:56.638 align:start position:0%
registry in new hampshire all other
 
05:32:58.230 --> 05:32:58.240 align:start position:0%
vaccine providers are encouraged to
 
05:33:00.788 --> 05:33:00.798 align:start position:0%
voluntarily participate so not every
 
05:33:03.030 --> 05:33:03.040 align:start position:0%
immunization is recorded into the new
 
05:33:05.030 --> 05:33:05.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire immunization information
 
05:33:05.040 --> 05:33:06.310 align:start position:0%
hampshire immunization information
system

05:33:06.310 --> 05:33:06.320 align:start position:0%
system
 
05:33:08.708 --> 05:33:08.718 align:start position:0%
additionally no individual is required
 
05:33:10.788 --> 05:33:10.798 align:start position:0%
to participate in the immunization
 
05:33:13.670 --> 05:33:13.680 align:start position:0%
registry they may have the option to opt
 
05:33:17.110 --> 05:33:17.120 align:start position:0%
out meaning that no information is sent
 
05:33:20.070 --> 05:33:20.080 align:start position:0%
to the ias by their vaccinating provider
 
05:33:21.830 --> 05:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
and they may also withdraw their
 
05:33:24.628 --> 05:33:24.638 align:start position:0%
information from the ies which is the
 
05:33:26.628 --> 05:33:26.638 align:start position:0%
discussion for today meaning that they
 
05:33:28.708 --> 05:33:28.718 align:start position:0%
can remove their existing information
 
05:33:30.628 --> 05:33:30.638 align:start position:0%
from the system
 
05:33:34.350 --> 05:33:34.360 align:start position:0%
the department is on in opposition to hb
 
05:33:36.948 --> 05:33:36.958 align:start position:0%
1487 because it removes the health
 
05:33:39.270 --> 05:33:39.280 align:start position:0%
repair provider from decisions that can
 
05:33:41.670 --> 05:33:41.680 align:start position:0%
impact future health care and does not
 
05:33:43.990 --> 05:33:44.000 align:start position:0%
inform the individual making the request
 
05:33:45.750 --> 05:33:45.760 align:start position:0%
of the implications of withdrawing their
 
05:33:45.760 --> 05:33:47.910 align:start position:0%
of the implications of withdrawing their
information

05:33:47.910 --> 05:33:47.920 align:start position:0%
information
 
05:33:49.910 --> 05:33:49.920 align:start position:0%
we also need to note that the
 
05:33:53.270 --> 05:33:53.280 align:start position:0%
immunization registry was developed in
 
05:33:56.150 --> 05:33:56.160 align:start position:0%
mind for childhood immunization the
 
05:33:59.350 --> 05:33:59.360 align:start position:0%
pandemic coveted vaccination was a very
 
05:34:01.430 --> 05:34:01.440 align:start position:0%
unusual event
 
05:34:03.830 --> 05:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
so there's a lot of information that
 
05:34:06.150 --> 05:34:06.160 align:start position:0%
should be considered under that
 
05:34:08.150 --> 05:34:08.160 align:start position:0%
and having this
 
05:34:10.470 --> 05:34:10.480 align:start position:0%
bill go forward would be dangerous
 
05:34:13.190 --> 05:34:13.200 align:start position:0%
especially for those providers
 
05:34:15.750 --> 05:34:15.760 align:start position:0%
especially caring for children
 
05:34:17.350 --> 05:34:17.360 align:start position:0%
it is important to involve those
 
05:34:19.670 --> 05:34:19.680 align:start position:0%
providers in the process to withdraw
 
05:34:22.390 --> 05:34:22.400 align:start position:0%
from the registry
 
05:34:25.110 --> 05:34:25.120 align:start position:0%
the um
 
05:34:27.910 --> 05:34:27.920 align:start position:0%
people who are choosing to withdraw also
 
05:34:30.150 --> 05:34:30.160 align:start position:0%
should know that they would be
 
05:34:31.750 --> 05:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
responsible for maintaining their
 
05:34:34.788 --> 05:34:34.798 align:start position:0%
immunization record the their iis
 
05:34:36.788 --> 05:34:36.798 align:start position:0%
information would delete all
 
05:34:38.948 --> 05:34:38.958 align:start position:0%
immunization information when they do
 
05:34:41.350 --> 05:34:41.360 align:start position:0%
submit a withdrawal form this would be
 
05:34:43.190 --> 05:34:43.200 align:start position:0%
problematic for individuals who are not
 
05:34:44.708 --> 05:34:44.718 align:start position:0%
able to retrieve their vaccination
 
05:34:46.470 --> 05:34:46.480 align:start position:0%
record from providers who previously
 
05:34:49.270 --> 05:34:49.280 align:start position:0%
administered their vaccine
 
05:34:52.868 --> 05:34:52.878 align:start position:0%
while hb 1487 aims to unburden those who
 
05:34:54.230 --> 05:34:54.240 align:start position:0%
choose not to participate in the
 
05:34:55.990 --> 05:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
registry does place the onus of
 
05:34:58.070 --> 05:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
communication on the individual the
 
05:34:59.750 --> 05:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
individual would need to inform their
 
05:35:01.510 --> 05:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
primary care provider of their decision
 
05:35:04.310 --> 05:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
to withdraw as the providers would not
 
05:35:06.788 --> 05:35:06.798 align:start position:0%
have any knowledge about this decision
 
05:35:09.990 --> 05:35:10.000 align:start position:0%
and if they had they would have also had
 
05:35:12.230 --> 05:35:12.240 align:start position:0%
the individual signed an opt-out form to
 
05:35:15.270 --> 05:35:15.280 align:start position:0%
prevent future information from being
 
05:35:17.110 --> 05:35:17.120 align:start position:0%
sent to the iis
 
05:35:18.948 --> 05:35:18.958 align:start position:0%
in the event that the patient fails to
 
05:35:21.190 --> 05:35:21.200 align:start position:0%
communicate their choice to withdraw
 
05:35:24.070 --> 05:35:24.080 align:start position:0%
and subsequently opt out the provider
 
05:35:26.868 --> 05:35:26.878 align:start position:0%
would then become liable if records are
 
05:35:28.628 --> 05:35:28.638 align:start position:0%
sent in the future
 
05:35:30.628 --> 05:35:30.638 align:start position:0%
the removal of the provider's signature
 
05:35:33.270 --> 05:35:33.280 align:start position:0%
from the withdrawal form also
 
05:35:35.350 --> 05:35:35.360 align:start position:0%
eliminates the only mechanism that is
 
05:35:37.110 --> 05:35:37.120 align:start position:0%
currently in place to validate the
 
05:35:39.350 --> 05:35:39.360 align:start position:0%
identity of the person requesting the
 
05:35:42.150 --> 05:35:42.160 align:start position:0%
deletion of iis records the department
 
05:35:44.390 --> 05:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
is at risk of being liable for deleting
 
05:35:46.708 --> 05:35:46.718 align:start position:0%
information in the event of fraudulent
 
05:35:48.708 --> 05:35:48.718 align:start position:0%
requests to do so
 
05:35:49.990 --> 05:35:50.000 align:start position:0%
while the requirement for the health
 
05:35:51.190 --> 05:35:51.200 align:start position:0%
care provider signature on the
 
05:35:53.190 --> 05:35:53.200 align:start position:0%
withdrawal form is an extra step for
 
05:35:55.670 --> 05:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
individuals this step provides important
 
05:35:57.670 --> 05:35:57.680 align:start position:0%
protections for the health care provider
 
05:35:59.830 --> 05:35:59.840 align:start position:0%
and the department this step promotes
 
05:36:01.670 --> 05:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
informed decision making improved
 
05:36:03.990 --> 05:36:04.000 align:start position:0%
communication and provides protection
 
05:36:06.548 --> 05:36:06.558 align:start position:0%
against fraudulent requests
 
05:36:08.628 --> 05:36:08.638 align:start position:0%
thank you very much i'll be happy to
 
05:36:10.708 --> 05:36:10.718 align:start position:0%
answer any questions any questions for
 
05:36:12.390 --> 05:36:12.400 align:start position:0%
the members of the department the chair
 
05:36:17.030 --> 05:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:19.270 --> 05:36:19.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
05:36:22.150 --> 05:36:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:24.788 --> 05:36:24.798 align:start position:0%
i don't think we want to discuss
 
05:36:26.470 --> 05:36:26.480 align:start position:0%
political titles right now he's been
 
05:36:30.628 --> 05:36:30.638 align:start position:0%
like a son to me all these years
 
05:36:32.788 --> 05:36:32.798 align:start position:0%
i guess it would be proper to thank the
 
05:36:35.190 --> 05:36:35.200 align:start position:0%
chairman for his um
 
05:36:37.270 --> 05:36:37.280 align:start position:0%
his recognition his genetics and his
 
05:36:39.830 --> 05:36:39.840 align:start position:0%
tuition money
 
05:36:41.910 --> 05:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
with that being said
 
05:36:43.270 --> 05:36:43.280 align:start position:0%
you mentioned an
 
05:36:44.548 --> 05:36:44.558 align:start position:0%
opt-out form
 
05:36:47.590 --> 05:36:47.600 align:start position:0%
that's involved where is that opt-out
 
05:36:47.600 --> 05:36:48.628 align:start position:0%
that's involved where is that opt-out
form

05:36:48.628 --> 05:36:48.638 align:start position:0%
form
 
05:36:48.638 --> 05:36:49.670 align:start position:0%
form
record

05:36:49.670 --> 05:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
record
 
05:36:49.680 --> 05:36:51.750 align:start position:0%
record
kept

05:36:51.750 --> 05:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
kept
 
05:36:54.628 --> 05:36:54.638 align:start position:0%
once once a person files that opt-out
 
05:36:56.070 --> 05:36:56.080 align:start position:0%
form where is that record kept and
 
05:36:56.080 --> 05:36:57.270 align:start position:0%
form where is that record kept and
maintained

05:36:57.270 --> 05:36:57.280 align:start position:0%
maintained
 
05:36:59.590 --> 05:36:59.600 align:start position:0%
the opt out form is kept with the
 
05:37:02.470 --> 05:37:02.480 align:start position:0%
provider so that way the providers the
 
05:37:04.948 --> 05:37:04.958 align:start position:0%
opt-out form is completed by the
 
05:37:07.430 --> 05:37:07.440 align:start position:0%
provider with the patient
 
05:37:09.750 --> 05:37:09.760 align:start position:0%
and the opt-out form is what keeps the
 
05:37:12.390 --> 05:37:12.400 align:start position:0%
information from coming to
 
05:37:13.910 --> 05:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
the iis
 
05:37:16.150 --> 05:37:16.160 align:start position:0%
upon the time of vaccination so that is
 
05:37:18.548 --> 05:37:18.558 align:start position:0%
something that is done in the office
 
05:37:21.190 --> 05:37:21.200 align:start position:0%
when somebody is receiving vaccination
 
05:37:23.270 --> 05:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
the provider is the person that keeps
 
05:37:25.270 --> 05:37:25.280 align:start position:0%
that record on file
 
05:37:27.590 --> 05:37:27.600 align:start position:0%
and that's the mechanism that prevents
 
05:37:30.948 --> 05:37:30.958 align:start position:0%
the information from flowing to the iis
 
05:37:33.830 --> 05:37:33.840 align:start position:0%
follow-up thank you so
 
05:37:36.150 --> 05:37:36.160 align:start position:0%
if your provider is
 
05:37:37.910 --> 05:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
keeping this form and the state is not
 
05:37:40.628 --> 05:37:40.638 align:start position:0%
attaching this record to
 
05:37:43.270 --> 05:37:43.280 align:start position:0%
any sort of database that this
 
05:37:43.280 --> 05:37:44.868 align:start position:0%
any sort of database that this
particular

05:37:44.868 --> 05:37:44.878 align:start position:0%
particular
 
05:37:48.390 --> 05:37:48.400 align:start position:0%
resident is in an opt-out status
 
05:37:50.708 --> 05:37:50.718 align:start position:0%
if as we saw with the i mean i assisted
 
05:37:53.350 --> 05:37:53.360 align:start position:0%
the national guard with the rollout in
 
05:37:56.708 --> 05:37:56.718 align:start position:0%
hooksett okay um as a fire service
 
05:37:56.718 --> 05:37:58.070 align:start position:0%
hooksett okay um as a fire service
liaison

05:37:58.070 --> 05:37:58.080 align:start position:0%
liaison
 
05:38:01.590 --> 05:38:01.600 align:start position:0%
so if a person was to go to an urgent
 
05:38:05.190 --> 05:38:05.200 align:start position:0%
care or in this case
 
05:38:07.190 --> 05:38:07.200 align:start position:0%
a vaccination
 
05:38:09.110 --> 05:38:09.120 align:start position:0%
location or such as that and didn't go
 
05:38:11.430 --> 05:38:11.440 align:start position:0%
through their primary care
 
05:38:13.190 --> 05:38:13.200 align:start position:0%
that record would therefore then be
 
05:38:15.350 --> 05:38:15.360 align:start position:0%
useless correct
 
05:38:17.510 --> 05:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
the opt-out form would be useless
 
05:38:18.788 --> 05:38:18.798 align:start position:0%
i think it's also important to
 
05:38:20.230 --> 05:38:20.240 align:start position:0%
distinguish the difference between the
 
05:38:22.470 --> 05:38:22.480 align:start position:0%
opt-out form and the withdrawal form
 
05:38:24.390 --> 05:38:24.400 align:start position:0%
so this bill is related to the
 
05:38:26.708 --> 05:38:26.718 align:start position:0%
withdrawal form the opt-out form would
 
05:38:28.948 --> 05:38:28.958 align:start position:0%
be that the information would have have
 
05:38:31.910 --> 05:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
not ever been sent to the department so
 
05:38:34.788 --> 05:38:34.798 align:start position:0%
therefore a you know it's that's kept at
 
05:38:36.788 --> 05:38:36.798 align:start position:0%
the provider level in the withdrawal
 
05:38:39.110 --> 05:38:39.120 align:start position:0%
form is what is in question here under
 
05:38:40.470 --> 05:38:40.480 align:start position:0%
the spill
 
05:38:43.110 --> 05:38:43.120 align:start position:0%
one more if you if i could one more okay
 
05:38:44.788 --> 05:38:44.798 align:start position:0%
so then
 
05:38:46.708 --> 05:38:46.718 align:start position:0%
this does apply here in the sense that
 
05:38:48.310 --> 05:38:48.320 align:start position:0%
if i opted out
 
05:38:49.750 --> 05:38:49.760 align:start position:0%
with that procedure which is not
 
05:38:51.350 --> 05:38:51.360 align:start position:0%
discussed here and then i went to a
 
05:38:54.150 --> 05:38:54.160 align:start position:0%
different location they have now put me
 
05:38:56.070 --> 05:38:56.080 align:start position:0%
into a database that i didn't want to go
 
05:38:57.990 --> 05:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
in because they don't have my opt-out
 
05:38:58.000 --> 05:38:59.110 align:start position:0%
in because they don't have my opt-out
form

05:38:59.110 --> 05:38:59.120 align:start position:0%
form
 
05:39:00.310 --> 05:39:00.320 align:start position:0%
and it may have been something that
 
05:39:01.910 --> 05:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
slipped my mind and i do now have to
 
05:39:03.590 --> 05:39:03.600 align:start position:0%
have a way to withdraw
 
05:39:05.110 --> 05:39:05.120 align:start position:0%
because i never intended to be in it in
 
05:39:06.628 --> 05:39:06.638 align:start position:0%
the first place
 
05:39:08.230 --> 05:39:08.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question the opt out
 
05:39:09.910 --> 05:39:09.920 align:start position:0%
form would be completed by any
 
05:39:11.750 --> 05:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
vaccination provider
 
05:39:13.830 --> 05:39:13.840 align:start position:0%
so if you went to a different provider
 
05:39:16.548 --> 05:39:16.558 align:start position:0%
for a different vaccination that opt-out
 
05:39:18.470 --> 05:39:18.480 align:start position:0%
would happen in advance
 
05:39:20.628 --> 05:39:20.638 align:start position:0%
so the withdrawal form
 
05:39:22.628 --> 05:39:22.638 align:start position:0%
would not apply because that information
 
05:39:24.150 --> 05:39:24.160 align:start position:0%
would not be at the state yeah that's
 
05:39:26.230 --> 05:39:26.240 align:start position:0%
not how that this all rolled out
 
05:39:28.948 --> 05:39:28.958 align:start position:0%
with the military just so you know
 
05:39:32.548 --> 05:39:32.558 align:start position:0%
and during the emergency order 76 the
 
05:39:38.310 --> 05:39:38.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:40.470 --> 05:39:40.480 align:start position:0%
any further questions representative
 
05:39:40.480 --> 05:39:41.830 align:start position:0%
any further questions representative
cushman

05:39:41.830 --> 05:39:41.840 align:start position:0%
cushman
 
05:39:43.270 --> 05:39:43.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
05:39:45.190 --> 05:39:45.200 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
05:39:47.590 --> 05:39:47.600 align:start position:0%
so it sounds like uh
 
05:39:49.990 --> 05:39:50.000 align:start position:0%
getting to the point of all of this is
 
05:39:52.470 --> 05:39:52.480 align:start position:0%
that people deserve the right to opt out
 
05:39:55.590 --> 05:39:55.600 align:start position:0%
they deserve the right to withdraw okay
 
05:39:58.470 --> 05:39:58.480 align:start position:0%
right now it's very burdensome
 
05:40:01.190 --> 05:40:01.200 align:start position:0%
you have to go through every
 
05:40:04.470 --> 05:40:04.480 align:start position:0%
um you have to put an opt-in out form
 
05:40:07.430 --> 05:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
with every provider that you've gone to
 
05:40:10.470 --> 05:40:10.480 align:start position:0%
that has vaccination records
 
05:40:12.390 --> 05:40:12.400 align:start position:0%
and you need to
 
05:40:14.310 --> 05:40:14.320 align:start position:0%
withdraw through every provider who has
 
05:40:17.590 --> 05:40:17.600 align:start position:0%
your vaccination records is that correct
 
05:40:19.110 --> 05:40:19.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question the
 
05:40:21.590 --> 05:40:21.600 align:start position:0%
withdrawal form would only happen once
 
05:40:23.750 --> 05:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
with the um that because that would be
 
05:40:25.670 --> 05:40:25.680 align:start position:0%
coming directly to the state to remove
 
05:40:27.670 --> 05:40:27.680 align:start position:0%
any existing record
 
05:40:27.680 --> 05:40:28.628 align:start position:0%
any existing record
follow

05:40:28.628 --> 05:40:28.638 align:start position:0%
follow
 
05:40:29.830 --> 05:40:29.840 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
05:40:33.190 --> 05:40:33.200 align:start position:0%
okay so if one with drew then your
 
05:40:35.030 --> 05:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
records are taken out
 
05:40:37.670 --> 05:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
and then if you went to another doctor
 
05:40:38.548 --> 05:40:38.558 align:start position:0%
and you
 
05:40:41.030 --> 05:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
like and you didn't go back to that one
 
05:40:44.310 --> 05:40:44.320 align:start position:0%
anymore and you went to another one
 
05:40:46.070 --> 05:40:46.080 align:start position:0%
and that doctor
 
05:40:48.708 --> 05:40:48.718 align:start position:0%
gave you a vaccination and sent or or
 
05:40:50.230 --> 05:40:50.240 align:start position:0%
counseled you on vaccination and sent
 
05:40:51.830 --> 05:40:51.840 align:start position:0%
that information
 
05:40:53.910 --> 05:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
to the
 
05:40:53.920 --> 05:40:55.830 align:start position:0%
to the
registry

05:40:55.830 --> 05:40:55.840 align:start position:0%
registry
 
05:40:55.840 --> 05:40:57.190 align:start position:0%
registry
right

05:40:57.190 --> 05:40:57.200 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:40:59.270 --> 05:40:59.280 align:start position:0%
you did withdraw but you only withdrew
 
05:41:01.510 --> 05:41:01.520 align:start position:0%
the historical data up to that point and
 
05:41:02.948 --> 05:41:02.958 align:start position:0%
then if you didn't do an opt-out they
 
05:41:04.628 --> 05:41:04.638 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be violating anything by
 
05:41:05.990 --> 05:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
sending your information because you
 
05:41:09.030 --> 05:41:09.040 align:start position:0%
didn't opt out is that correct
 
05:41:10.628 --> 05:41:10.638 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your question
 
05:41:12.548 --> 05:41:12.558 align:start position:0%
that is correct and that's why we feel
 
05:41:14.150 --> 05:41:14.160 align:start position:0%
as though the providers should be
 
05:41:17.110 --> 05:41:17.120 align:start position:0%
involved in this decision so that the
 
05:41:19.590 --> 05:41:19.600 align:start position:0%
patients can be thoroughly informed and
 
05:41:21.590 --> 05:41:21.600 align:start position:0%
and that there's a mechanism for
 
05:41:21.600 --> 05:41:23.350 align:start position:0%
and that there's a mechanism for
communicating

05:41:23.350 --> 05:41:23.360 align:start position:0%
communicating
 
05:41:25.750 --> 05:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
the the process to ensure that there's
 
05:41:27.270 --> 05:41:27.280 align:start position:0%
no problem one more information being
 
05:41:29.590 --> 05:41:29.600 align:start position:0%
sent thank you mr chairman uh thank you
 
05:41:31.350 --> 05:41:31.360 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
05:41:31.360 --> 05:41:32.628 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
are

05:41:32.628 --> 05:41:32.638 align:start position:0%
are
 
05:41:35.430 --> 05:41:35.440 align:start position:0%
physicians and medical providers the
 
05:41:37.030 --> 05:41:37.040 align:start position:0%
only source of information on the
 
05:41:40.150 --> 05:41:40.160 align:start position:0%
vaccine registry or can people find out
 
05:41:42.868 --> 05:41:42.878 align:start position:0%
the information on it on its purpose on
 
05:41:45.030 --> 05:41:45.040 align:start position:0%
how to withdraw and how to opt out
 
05:41:45.040 --> 05:41:47.510 align:start position:0%
how to withdraw and how to opt out
elsewhere

05:41:47.510 --> 05:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
elsewhere
 
05:41:48.868 --> 05:41:48.878 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your question
 
05:41:51.270 --> 05:41:51.280 align:start position:0%
that information about how to
 
05:41:54.390 --> 05:41:54.400 align:start position:0%
is on the website and the testimony has
 
05:41:57.150 --> 05:41:57.160 align:start position:0%
the links for those
 
05:42:03.510 --> 05:42:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:05.270 --> 05:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
05:42:05.280 --> 05:42:06.390 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
question

05:42:06.390 --> 05:42:06.400 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:42:09.030 --> 05:42:09.040 align:start position:0%
so if this bill were to pass
 
05:42:09.040 --> 05:42:09.910 align:start position:0%
so if this bill were to pass
and

05:42:09.910 --> 05:42:09.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:42:12.868 --> 05:42:12.878 align:start position:0%
somebody else sent in with knowing my
 
05:42:14.548 --> 05:42:14.558 align:start position:0%
inability to remember these things
 
05:42:16.708 --> 05:42:16.718 align:start position:0%
myself and my desire to remain in a
 
05:42:19.190 --> 05:42:19.200 align:start position:0%
registry if somebody was particularly
 
05:42:23.030 --> 05:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
annoyed at me and sent in a
 
05:42:25.590 --> 05:42:25.600 align:start position:0%
request to withdraw
 
05:42:27.430 --> 05:42:27.440 align:start position:0%
with my signature on it that wasn't
 
05:42:29.030 --> 05:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
signed by me
 
05:42:30.868 --> 05:42:30.878 align:start position:0%
is there any way that anybody at the
 
05:42:32.788 --> 05:42:32.798 align:start position:0%
registry would know that that wasn't me
 
05:42:34.948 --> 05:42:34.958 align:start position:0%
and would
 
05:42:36.868 --> 05:42:36.878 align:start position:0%
and and
 
05:42:36.878 --> 05:42:37.990 align:start position:0%
and and
so

05:42:37.990 --> 05:42:38.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:42:38.000 --> 05:42:39.750 align:start position:0%
so
or

05:42:39.750 --> 05:42:39.760 align:start position:0%
or
 
05:42:41.030 --> 05:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
is there any way they would know it
 
05:42:43.270 --> 05:42:43.280 align:start position:0%
wasn't me so that they could
 
05:42:45.430 --> 05:42:45.440 align:start position:0%
follow up with what was going on
 
05:42:47.750 --> 05:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your question
 
05:42:50.310 --> 05:42:50.320 align:start position:0%
this bill if enacted would remove the
 
05:42:53.190 --> 05:42:53.200 align:start position:0%
way the only mechanism that the registry
 
05:42:55.110 --> 05:42:55.120 align:start position:0%
would have the information about if it
 
05:42:57.830 --> 05:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
was a valid request to withdraw or not
 
05:42:59.990 --> 05:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
and that would be accurate that anyone
 
05:43:01.830 --> 05:43:01.840 align:start position:0%
who had a person's name and date of
 
05:43:03.590 --> 05:43:03.600 align:start position:0%
birth could go ahead and make these
 
05:43:05.350 --> 05:43:05.360 align:start position:0%
fraudulent requests and that would be a
 
05:43:11.750 --> 05:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:11.760 --> 05:43:14.310 align:start position:0%
 
merchant

05:43:14.310 --> 05:43:14.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:15.750 --> 05:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman also thank you for
 
05:43:17.030 --> 05:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
taking the question i want to follow up
 
05:43:19.110 --> 05:43:19.120 align:start position:0%
on a question representative cushman
 
05:43:19.120 --> 05:43:21.030 align:start position:0%
on a question representative cushman
raised

05:43:21.030 --> 05:43:21.040 align:start position:0%
raised
 
05:43:24.708 --> 05:43:24.718 align:start position:0%
when the request to withdraw is made
 
05:43:26.548 --> 05:43:26.558 align:start position:0%
the subsequent additions can be made
 
05:43:28.788 --> 05:43:28.798 align:start position:0%
there's no permanent blocking of any
 
05:43:30.628 --> 05:43:30.638 align:start position:0%
additional information coming to that
 
05:43:33.350 --> 05:43:33.360 align:start position:0%
registry that correct this point in time
 
05:43:36.470 --> 05:43:36.480 align:start position:0%
that is correct under current law
 
05:43:38.548 --> 05:43:38.558 align:start position:0%
the administrative rules we are not
 
05:43:40.708 --> 05:43:40.718 align:start position:0%
allowed to keep that record of the
 
05:43:43.590 --> 05:43:43.600 align:start position:0%
withdrawal to request so it is a
 
05:43:45.990 --> 05:43:46.000 align:start position:0%
one-time event we look to see the
 
05:43:48.628 --> 05:43:48.638 align:start position:0%
request we remove the record and then
 
05:43:53.270 --> 05:43:53.280 align:start position:0%
even that request to re withdraw is
 
05:43:53.280 --> 05:43:55.030 align:start position:0%
even that request to re withdraw is
eliminated

05:43:55.030 --> 05:43:55.040 align:start position:0%
eliminated
 
05:43:57.670 --> 05:43:57.680 align:start position:0%

05:44:02.948 --> 05:44:02.958 align:start position:0%
fascinated about the withdrawal form
 
05:44:05.830 --> 05:44:05.840 align:start position:0%
which goes straight to y'all
 
05:44:07.350 --> 05:44:07.360 align:start position:0%
as opposed to
 
05:44:09.430 --> 05:44:09.440 align:start position:0%
uh one at a time
 
05:44:09.440 --> 05:44:10.548 align:start position:0%
uh one at a time
um

05:44:10.548 --> 05:44:10.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:44:13.030 --> 05:44:13.040 align:start position:0%
the other form the the
 
05:44:14.470 --> 05:44:14.480 align:start position:0%
opt-out form
 
05:44:18.548 --> 05:44:18.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:18.558 --> 05:44:20.150 align:start position:0%
 
sorry

05:44:20.150 --> 05:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
05:44:21.270 --> 05:44:21.280 align:start position:0%
it seems
 
05:44:23.510 --> 05:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
is there any way there's no
 
05:44:25.990 --> 05:44:26.000 align:start position:0%
is there any notification when you get a
 
05:44:26.000 --> 05:44:27.590 align:start position:0%
is there any notification when you get a
withdrawal

05:44:27.590 --> 05:44:27.600 align:start position:0%
withdrawal
 
05:44:29.590 --> 05:44:29.600 align:start position:0%
to send it back to the person who
 
05:44:32.788 --> 05:44:32.798 align:start position:0%
requested it so that you don't
 
05:44:36.150 --> 05:44:36.160 align:start position:0%
allow somebody fraudulently to withdraw
 
05:44:36.160 --> 05:44:37.270 align:start position:0%
allow somebody fraudulently to withdraw
somebody

05:44:37.270 --> 05:44:37.280 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
05:44:38.948 --> 05:44:38.958 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question there is no
 
05:44:43.830 --> 05:44:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:45.910 --> 05:44:45.920 align:start position:0%
any further questions on the folks from
 
05:44:45.920 --> 05:44:48.948 align:start position:0%
any further questions on the folks from
dhhs

05:44:48.948 --> 05:44:48.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:51.670 --> 05:44:51.680 align:start position:0%
thanks for comings
 
05:44:53.670 --> 05:44:53.680 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes we're now in the three
 
05:44:53.680 --> 05:44:55.590 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes we're now in the three
minutes

05:44:55.590 --> 05:44:55.600 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
05:44:55.600 --> 05:44:56.628 align:start position:0%
minutes
zone

05:44:56.628 --> 05:44:56.638 align:start position:0%
zone
 
05:44:59.510 --> 05:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
so the chair recognizes laura condon
 
05:45:02.628 --> 05:45:02.638 align:start position:0%
from bedford who speaks in support of
 
05:45:09.270 --> 05:45:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:10.628 --> 05:45:10.638 align:start position:0%
good afternoon thank you for the
 
05:45:12.390 --> 05:45:12.400 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak my name is laura
 
05:45:14.230 --> 05:45:14.240 align:start position:0%
conde and i'm from bedford
 
05:45:17.190 --> 05:45:17.200 align:start position:0%
um i do want to mention up front that i
 
05:45:20.310 --> 05:45:20.320 align:start position:0%
dhhs persists in mentioning the iis
 
05:45:22.230 --> 05:45:22.240 align:start position:0%
which is the immunization information
 
05:45:24.628 --> 05:45:24.638 align:start position:0%
system that is not the state vaccination
 
05:45:27.110 --> 05:45:27.120 align:start position:0%
registry the iis is initiative and
 
05:45:28.948 --> 05:45:28.958 align:start position:0%
program of the federal government that
 
05:45:31.510 --> 05:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
has not been adopted in state statute
 
05:45:34.628 --> 05:45:34.638 align:start position:0%
and um dhhs has been given no authority
 
05:45:37.110 --> 05:45:37.120 align:start position:0%
to operate in iis there is only
 
05:45:38.948 --> 05:45:38.958 align:start position:0%
statutory authority for vaccination
 
05:45:38.958 --> 05:45:40.310 align:start position:0%
statutory authority for vaccination
registry

05:45:40.310 --> 05:45:40.320 align:start position:0%
registry
 
05:45:41.990 --> 05:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
it is important that the individual have
 
05:45:43.510 --> 05:45:43.520 align:start position:0%
the right to withdraw from the state
 
05:45:45.430 --> 05:45:45.440 align:start position:0%
vaccination registry without the
 
05:45:47.830 --> 05:45:47.840 align:start position:0%
requirement of a doctor's permission and
 
05:45:49.590 --> 05:45:49.600 align:start position:0%
signature doctors should not be the
 
05:45:52.628 --> 05:45:52.638 align:start position:0%
gatekeepers on individual privacy rights
 
05:45:54.628 --> 05:45:54.638 align:start position:0%
in fact as you've heard the doctor must
 
05:45:56.868 --> 05:45:56.878 align:start position:0%
be a participant in the registry to
 
05:45:59.350 --> 05:45:59.360 align:start position:0%
withdraw you from it um and would you
 
05:46:02.070 --> 05:46:02.080 align:start position:0%
believe that my my current doctor is not
 
05:46:04.470 --> 05:46:04.480 align:start position:0%
a participant in the registry and would
 
05:46:06.948 --> 05:46:06.958 align:start position:0%
you also believe that refusal of a
 
05:46:09.590 --> 05:46:09.600 align:start position:0%
vaccination is a registry event so if i
 
05:46:11.510 --> 05:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
were to refuse a vaccination i could be
 
05:46:13.430 --> 05:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
put into that registry and would not
 
05:46:15.590 --> 05:46:15.600 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to
 
05:46:15.600 --> 05:46:16.830 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to
withdraw

05:46:16.830 --> 05:46:16.840 align:start position:0%
withdraw
 
05:46:16.840 --> 05:46:18.470 align:start position:0%
withdraw
um

05:46:18.470 --> 05:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:46:20.868 --> 05:46:20.878 align:start position:0%
and and i here to mention here that they
 
05:46:22.470 --> 05:46:22.480 align:start position:0%
they walk withdrawal and it was a good
 
05:46:24.230 --> 05:46:24.240 align:start position:0%
point made by representative connerk
 
05:46:26.548 --> 05:46:26.558 align:start position:0%
that the withdrawal signature is evident
 
05:46:28.788 --> 05:46:28.798 align:start position:0%
in documentation of the conversation in
 
05:46:30.788 --> 05:46:30.798 align:start position:0%
fact i would say that was a good point
 
05:46:33.350 --> 05:46:33.360 align:start position:0%
and it certainly argues exactly why
 
05:46:35.590 --> 05:46:35.600 align:start position:0%
patient documentation should be required
 
05:46:37.990 --> 05:46:38.000 align:start position:0%
in the first place is an opt-in to this
 
05:46:40.070 --> 05:46:40.080 align:start position:0%
registry that will provide that valuable
 
05:46:41.830 --> 05:46:41.840 align:start position:0%
documentation that i think needs to be
 
05:46:45.350 --> 05:46:45.360 align:start position:0%
had both ways going in and coming out
 
05:46:47.990 --> 05:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
so i urge the committee to support this
 
05:46:49.750 --> 05:46:49.760 align:start position:0%
bill thank you and i'd be happy to take
 
05:46:51.670 --> 05:46:51.680 align:start position:0%
any questions thank you very much are
 
05:46:53.670 --> 05:46:53.680 align:start position:0%
there any questions miss condon
 
05:46:55.990 --> 05:46:56.000 align:start position:0%
representative cushman
 
05:46:57.510 --> 05:46:57.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
05:46:59.190 --> 05:46:59.200 align:start position:0%
uh miss conan
 
05:47:00.708 --> 05:47:00.718 align:start position:0%
would you agree
 
05:47:03.670 --> 05:47:03.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:06.548 --> 05:47:06.558 align:start position:0%
the current method of withdrawing one's
 
05:47:08.868 --> 05:47:08.878 align:start position:0%
private health information from the
 
05:47:12.470 --> 05:47:12.480 align:start position:0%
vaccine registry to be an unfair burden
 
05:47:14.788 --> 05:47:14.798 align:start position:0%
on those who are financially
 
05:47:17.510 --> 05:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
disadvantaged because it requires them
 
05:47:19.510 --> 05:47:19.520 align:start position:0%
to go and see their doctor and pay for a
 
05:47:19.520 --> 05:47:20.868 align:start position:0%
to go and see their doctor and pay for a
visit

05:47:20.868 --> 05:47:20.878 align:start position:0%
visit
 
05:47:22.310 --> 05:47:22.320 align:start position:0%
and that
 
05:47:23.670 --> 05:47:23.680 align:start position:0%
that could be
 
05:47:26.230 --> 05:47:26.240 align:start position:0%
thought of as a constitutional violation
 
05:47:29.270 --> 05:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
of article 2b thank you for the question
 
05:47:30.868 --> 05:47:30.878 align:start position:0%
representative cushman you make a very
 
05:47:33.590 --> 05:47:33.600 align:start position:0%
good point that in fact um in order to
 
05:47:35.910 --> 05:47:35.920 align:start position:0%
get the way this is currently stands in
 
05:47:37.590 --> 05:47:37.600 align:start position:0%
order to get out of the registry a
 
05:47:39.030 --> 05:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
patient actually would have to book
 
05:47:41.190 --> 05:47:41.200 align:start position:0%
appointment with their doctor's valuable
 
05:47:42.948 --> 05:47:42.958 align:start position:0%
time that should be spent on caring for
 
05:47:45.350 --> 05:47:45.360 align:start position:0%
sick people simply to get a signature to
 
05:47:48.230 --> 05:47:48.240 align:start position:0%
opt out of this registry so and and
 
05:47:49.830 --> 05:47:49.840 align:start position:0%
again they could immediately get swept
 
05:47:51.830 --> 05:47:51.840 align:start position:0%
back in and they'd have to go to each
 
05:47:54.070 --> 05:47:54.080 align:start position:0%
and every vaccinating provider to make
 
05:47:57.110 --> 05:47:57.120 align:start position:0%
sure they get um get taken out in fact
 
05:47:57.120 --> 05:47:57.910 align:start position:0%
sure they get um get taken out in fact
they

05:47:57.910 --> 05:47:57.920 align:start position:0%
they
 
05:48:00.310 --> 05:48:00.320 align:start position:0%
choose not to participate even requires
 
05:48:03.110 --> 05:48:03.120 align:start position:0%
a signature of the vaccinating
 
05:48:05.430 --> 05:48:05.440 align:start position:0%
vaccinating provider and hannaford
 
05:48:07.270 --> 05:48:07.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't even provide the opportunity to
 
05:48:08.470 --> 05:48:08.480 align:start position:0%
opt out
 
05:48:11.190 --> 05:48:11.200 align:start position:0%
huge burdens on individuals thank you
 
05:48:14.390 --> 05:48:14.400 align:start position:0%
representative folsom
 
05:48:15.830 --> 05:48:15.840 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman thank you for taking
 
05:48:17.750 --> 05:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
my question i just want to clarify
 
05:48:20.868 --> 05:48:20.878 align:start position:0%
something you said um
 
05:48:25.030 --> 05:48:25.040 align:start position:0%
you referred to the refusal of a vaccine
 
05:48:26.708 --> 05:48:26.718 align:start position:0%
as a
 
05:48:28.200 --> 05:48:28.210 align:start position:0%
vaccine event
 
05:48:28.210 --> 05:48:29.910 align:start position:0%
vaccine event
[Music]

05:48:29.910 --> 05:48:29.920 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:48:31.830 --> 05:48:31.840 align:start position:0%
would that then
 
05:48:35.590 --> 05:48:35.600 align:start position:0%
automatically go into the system because
 
05:48:38.150 --> 05:48:38.160 align:start position:0%
you didn't bother filling in opt-out
 
05:48:41.030 --> 05:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
because you didn't think that
 
05:48:43.190 --> 05:48:43.200 align:start position:0%
it went anywhere but they could still
 
05:48:46.390 --> 05:48:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:49.270 --> 05:48:49.280 align:start position:0%
you you refused i know you can't hear my
 
05:48:51.030 --> 05:48:51.040 align:start position:0%
head nodding but thank you very much for
 
05:48:52.788 --> 05:48:52.798 align:start position:0%
the question representative folsom that
 
05:48:55.590 --> 05:48:55.600 align:start position:0%
is exactly um correct the statute never
 
05:48:58.150 --> 05:48:58.160 align:start position:0%
intended that uh vaccination refusal
 
05:49:00.708 --> 05:49:00.718 align:start position:0%
would be a vaccination event but in fact
 
05:49:03.430 --> 05:49:03.440 align:start position:0%
in the the vaccination registry rules
 
05:49:07.190 --> 05:49:07.200 align:start position:0%
written by dhhs um refusal vaccination
 
05:49:09.830 --> 05:49:09.840 align:start position:0%
is defined as a vaccination event and
 
05:49:12.070 --> 05:49:12.080 align:start position:0%
recordable in the registry so write it
 
05:49:14.150 --> 05:49:14.160 align:start position:0%
if if you go to a doctor and they say
 
05:49:15.510 --> 05:49:15.520 align:start position:0%
you know would you like a flu shot you
 
05:49:17.350 --> 05:49:17.360 align:start position:0%
say no thanks i'm all set
 
05:49:19.510 --> 05:49:19.520 align:start position:0%
you don't realize that you've triggered
 
05:49:22.708 --> 05:49:22.718 align:start position:0%
being put into the registry
 
05:49:25.270 --> 05:49:25.280 align:start position:0%
it's not even intuitive thank you any
 
05:49:27.110 --> 05:49:27.120 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
05:49:29.030 --> 05:49:29.040 align:start position:0%
representative woods
 
05:49:30.230 --> 05:49:30.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
05:49:31.510 --> 05:49:31.520 align:start position:0%
taking my questions
 
05:49:34.310 --> 05:49:34.320 align:start position:0%
uh you mentioned that requires a visit
 
05:49:35.830 --> 05:49:35.840 align:start position:0%
to the doctor's office if you just want
 
05:49:37.030 --> 05:49:37.040 align:start position:0%
to get out of the registry do you have
 
05:49:39.750 --> 05:49:39.760 align:start position:0%
some data of how many physician offices
 
05:49:42.150 --> 05:49:42.160 align:start position:0%
require that
 
05:49:42.160 --> 05:49:43.510 align:start position:0%
require that
um

05:49:43.510 --> 05:49:43.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:49:45.270 --> 05:49:45.280 align:start position:0%
it's not the physician office that
 
05:49:47.990 --> 05:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
requires its required on the form
 
05:49:49.590 --> 05:49:49.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
05:49:52.628 --> 05:49:52.638 align:start position:0%
no my i'll maybe follow follow up i
 
05:49:54.868 --> 05:49:54.878 align:start position:0%
guess i'm trying to because i was left
 
05:49:56.948 --> 05:49:56.958 align:start position:0%
with the impression that to get out of
 
05:49:58.868 --> 05:49:58.878 align:start position:0%
the registry you'd have to go to the
 
05:50:00.708 --> 05:50:00.718 align:start position:0%
doctor's office
 
05:50:03.990 --> 05:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
for a visit and i'm trying to get some
 
05:50:06.470 --> 05:50:06.480 align:start position:0%
idea how many doctor's office require
 
05:50:06.480 --> 05:50:07.670 align:start position:0%
idea how many doctor's office require
you

05:50:07.670 --> 05:50:07.680 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:50:09.590 --> 05:50:09.600 align:start position:0%
to come to the doctor's office if you
 
05:50:11.590 --> 05:50:11.600 align:start position:0%
want them to sign you out of the
 
05:50:11.600 --> 05:50:13.670 align:start position:0%
want them to sign you out of the
registry

05:50:13.670 --> 05:50:13.680 align:start position:0%
registry
 
05:50:16.548 --> 05:50:16.558 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for the question i'm
 
05:50:18.390 --> 05:50:18.400 align:start position:0%
trying to clarify my answer for you the
 
05:50:20.310 --> 05:50:20.320 align:start position:0%
form in fact requires the doctor's
 
05:50:22.470 --> 05:50:22.480 align:start position:0%
signature i don't know how else you'll
 
05:50:25.030 --> 05:50:25.040 align:start position:0%
get that doctor's signature without
 
05:50:27.670 --> 05:50:27.680 align:start position:0%
presenting to the doctor with this form
 
05:50:29.270 --> 05:50:29.280 align:start position:0%
for the doctor to
 
05:50:31.270 --> 05:50:31.280 align:start position:0%
impose a signature on and in fact we've
 
05:50:34.150 --> 05:50:34.160 align:start position:0%
heard from prior testimony here that
 
05:50:35.830 --> 05:50:35.840 align:start position:0%
there there are doctors certainly we
 
05:50:37.990 --> 05:50:38.000 align:start position:0%
know that believe that of the doctor's
 
05:50:40.150 --> 05:50:40.160 align:start position:0%
visit should be required
 
05:50:42.628 --> 05:50:42.638 align:start position:0%
but i don't have an a number if that's
 
05:50:44.628 --> 05:50:44.638 align:start position:0%
what you're looking for representative
 
05:50:46.548 --> 05:50:46.558 align:start position:0%
woods uh thank you for thought would you
 
05:50:49.190 --> 05:50:49.200 align:start position:0%
believe that offices and i know a lot of
 
05:50:51.910 --> 05:50:51.920 align:start position:0%
offices that do not require that
 
05:50:54.070 --> 05:50:54.080 align:start position:0%
so i was worrying i'm curious about the
 
05:50:54.080 --> 05:50:55.110 align:start position:0%
so i was worrying i'm curious about the
number

05:50:55.110 --> 05:50:55.120 align:start position:0%
number
 
05:50:57.590 --> 05:50:57.600 align:start position:0%
uh that sort of get a balance because
 
05:50:59.670 --> 05:50:59.680 align:start position:0%
we're here on both sides and i needed
 
05:51:01.830 --> 05:51:01.840 align:start position:0%
some data thank you
 
05:51:03.190 --> 05:51:03.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i mean i
 
05:51:04.708 --> 05:51:04.718 align:start position:0%
don't know how a signature could be
 
05:51:06.310 --> 05:51:06.320 align:start position:0%
attained without physically presenting
 
05:51:08.230 --> 05:51:08.240 align:start position:0%
this form but thank you
 
05:51:10.830 --> 05:51:10.840 align:start position:0%
send it to the
 
05:51:15.590 --> 05:51:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:18.070 --> 05:51:18.080 align:start position:0%
i guess this is a would you believe
 
05:51:20.628 --> 05:51:20.638 align:start position:0%
back when my children were young
 
05:51:23.190 --> 05:51:23.200 align:start position:0%
and had a physical within the year when
 
05:51:27.030 --> 05:51:27.040 align:start position:0%
they needed the camp form signed
 
05:51:28.470 --> 05:51:28.480 align:start position:0%
you know in order to go to girl scout
 
05:51:30.708 --> 05:51:30.718 align:start position:0%
camp boy scout camp i
 
05:51:33.750 --> 05:51:33.760 align:start position:0%
dropped the form off at the doctor's
 
05:51:35.910 --> 05:51:35.920 align:start position:0%
no appointment because they had had
 
05:51:38.230 --> 05:51:38.240 align:start position:0%
their physical within the year and it
 
05:51:41.350 --> 05:51:41.360 align:start position:0%
was signed would you believe that could
 
05:51:44.628 --> 05:51:44.638 align:start position:0%
be a possibility in this instance
 
05:51:46.788 --> 05:51:46.798 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for the question so
 
05:51:49.110 --> 05:51:49.120 align:start position:0%
it certainly does seem plausible that a
 
05:51:51.510 --> 05:51:51.520 align:start position:0%
form could be dropped off
 
05:51:52.788 --> 05:51:52.798 align:start position:0%
which of course would require the
 
05:51:55.110 --> 05:51:55.120 align:start position:0%
patient to take time off of work during
 
05:51:57.110 --> 05:51:57.120 align:start position:0%
doctor's hours to drop off a form and
 
05:51:58.548 --> 05:51:58.558 align:start position:0%
then if the doctor's not available to
 
05:52:00.868 --> 05:52:00.878 align:start position:0%
sign it perhaps on a second day take
 
05:52:02.230 --> 05:52:02.240 align:start position:0%
more time off of work to go up and
 
05:52:03.830 --> 05:52:03.840 align:start position:0%
retrieve the form so thank you very much
 
05:52:06.830 --> 05:52:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:13.910 --> 05:52:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:16.070 --> 05:52:16.080 align:start position:0%
do you want to follow up
 
05:52:16.080 --> 05:52:17.510 align:start position:0%
do you want to follow up
okay

05:52:17.510 --> 05:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:52:18.868 --> 05:52:18.878 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much miss

05:52:52.470 --> 05:52:52.480 align:start position:0%
good afternoon mr chairman members of
 
05:52:54.310 --> 05:52:54.320 align:start position:0%
the committee paula minihan senior vice
 
05:52:55.670 --> 05:52:55.680 align:start position:0%
president state government relations
 
05:52:56.708 --> 05:52:56.718 align:start position:0%
with the new hampshire hospital
 
05:52:58.230 --> 05:52:58.240 align:start position:0%
association representing all our
 
05:53:00.868 --> 05:53:00.878 align:start position:0%
hospitals we are opposed to house bill
 
05:53:00.878 --> 05:53:03.110 align:start position:0%
hospitals we are opposed to house bill
1487

05:53:03.110 --> 05:53:03.120 align:start position:0%
1487
 
05:53:05.110 --> 05:53:05.120 align:start position:0%
as stated the bill would before you
 
05:53:07.270 --> 05:53:07.280 align:start position:0%
would remove the requirement outlined in
 
05:53:08.868 --> 05:53:08.878 align:start position:0%
rules that a health care provider
 
05:53:10.230 --> 05:53:10.240 align:start position:0%
signature shall
 
05:53:12.470 --> 05:53:12.480 align:start position:0%
not be required for withdrawal from the
 
05:53:14.708 --> 05:53:14.718 align:start position:0%
immunization registry
 
05:53:17.430 --> 05:53:17.440 align:start position:0%
and we believe that removing the
 
05:53:19.270 --> 05:53:19.280 align:start position:0%
provider signature requirement would be
 
05:53:21.510 --> 05:53:21.520 align:start position:0%
very problematic
 
05:53:23.910 --> 05:53:23.920 align:start position:0%
as outlined in the immunization registry
 
05:53:25.670 --> 05:53:25.680 align:start position:0%
administrative rules the provider is
 
05:53:27.110 --> 05:53:27.120 align:start position:0%
responsible for submitting that
 
05:53:29.270 --> 05:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
information to the department when an
 
05:53:31.670 --> 05:53:31.680 align:start position:0%
individual elects and i apologize i was
 
05:53:32.948 --> 05:53:32.958 align:start position:0%
using opt-out but it's really
 
05:53:35.750 --> 05:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
withdrawing so i apologize for that um
 
05:53:37.670 --> 05:53:37.680 align:start position:0%
the process is very straightforward and
 
05:53:40.070 --> 05:53:40.080 align:start position:0%
the form is quite simple i did provide a
 
05:53:43.350 --> 05:53:43.360 align:start position:0%
link but again that's for the opt out
 
05:53:45.190 --> 05:53:45.200 align:start position:0%
form but the withdrawal form is very
 
05:53:47.270 --> 05:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
similar i was just
 
05:53:48.868 --> 05:53:48.878 align:start position:0%
moving a little too quickly when i was
 
05:53:50.948 --> 05:53:50.958 align:start position:0%
doing this sorry um and
 
05:53:54.150 --> 05:53:54.160 align:start position:0%
i did notice in the preamble of the bill
 
05:53:56.150 --> 05:53:56.160 align:start position:0%
it talks about it being difficult to
 
05:53:59.350 --> 05:53:59.360 align:start position:0%
find to track down former transient
 
05:54:01.830 --> 05:54:01.840 align:start position:0%
providers for the purpose of signing the
 
05:54:04.868 --> 05:54:04.878 align:start position:0%
form and then further on in the
 
05:54:04.878 --> 05:54:06.150 align:start position:0%
form and then further on in the
preamble

05:54:06.150 --> 05:54:06.160 align:start position:0%
preamble
 
05:54:07.910 --> 05:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
it then talks about
 
05:54:10.070 --> 05:54:10.080 align:start position:0%
removal from the new hampshire registry
 
05:54:12.150 --> 05:54:12.160 align:start position:0%
requires a signature from current or
 
05:54:14.788 --> 05:54:14.798 align:start position:0%
former health care provider so the fact
 
05:54:16.708 --> 05:54:16.718 align:start position:0%
is the patient or guardian in the case
 
05:54:18.788 --> 05:54:18.798 align:start position:0%
of a minor does not need to track down
 
05:54:21.350 --> 05:54:21.360 align:start position:0%
the former transient provider to get the
 
05:54:22.548 --> 05:54:22.558 align:start position:0%
form signed
 
05:54:25.590 --> 05:54:25.600 align:start position:0%
um so we we believe as you know from
 
05:54:27.110 --> 05:54:27.120 align:start position:0%
prior testimony we believe in the
 
05:54:29.190 --> 05:54:29.200 align:start position:0%
registry we believe in
 
05:54:31.910 --> 05:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
opting out and we believe that you know
 
05:54:33.990 --> 05:54:34.000 align:start position:0%
we should fix the current system if it's
 
05:54:34.000 --> 05:54:35.510 align:start position:0%
we should fix the current system if it's
problematic

05:54:35.510 --> 05:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
problematic
 
05:54:38.788 --> 05:54:38.798 align:start position:0%
but eliminating that signature um by the
 
05:54:41.430 --> 05:54:41.440 align:start position:0%
provider we we believe is is
 
05:54:43.590 --> 05:54:43.600 align:start position:0%
a bridge too far and we can't support
 
05:54:45.750 --> 05:54:45.760 align:start position:0%
that happy to answer any questions any
 
05:54:45.760 --> 05:54:47.830 align:start position:0%
that happy to answer any questions any
for

05:54:47.830 --> 05:54:47.840 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:54:52.070 --> 05:54:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:54.470 --> 05:54:54.480 align:start position:0%
he's having trouble with your last name
 
05:54:56.070 --> 05:54:56.080 align:start position:0%
no i'm having trouble with the mic
 
05:54:57.190 --> 05:54:57.200 align:start position:0%

05:54:57.200 --> 05:55:01.910 align:start position:0%
thanks for picking a fight
[Laughter]

05:55:01.910 --> 05:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
05:55:03.270 --> 05:55:03.280 align:start position:0%
it's already dangerous enough for the
 
05:55:04.868 --> 05:55:04.878 align:start position:0%
two of us to be in this room together i
 
05:55:06.310 --> 05:55:06.320 align:start position:0%
don't know that you really want to do
 
05:55:06.320 --> 05:55:07.670 align:start position:0%
don't know that you really want to do
that

05:55:07.670 --> 05:55:07.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:55:07.680 --> 05:55:09.110 align:start position:0%
that
the

05:55:09.110 --> 05:55:09.120 align:start position:0%

05:55:11.680 --> 05:55:12.548 align:start position:0%
do i have the ability right now
to

05:55:12.548 --> 05:55:12.558 align:start position:0%

see

05:55:13.430 --> 05:55:13.440 align:start position:0%
see
 
05:55:16.628 --> 05:55:16.638 align:start position:0%
what my registration file looks like the
 
05:55:18.948 --> 05:55:18.958 align:start position:0%
content what's in it do i how do i go
 
05:55:20.708 --> 05:55:20.718 align:start position:0%
about doing that i want to see what my
 
05:55:22.150 --> 05:55:22.160 align:start position:0%
registration file looks like how do i do
 
05:55:24.070 --> 05:55:24.080 align:start position:0%
it i am not an expert on that i think
 
05:55:25.750 --> 05:55:25.760 align:start position:0%
the department could better answer that
 
05:55:30.310 --> 05:55:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:33.830 --> 05:55:33.840 align:start position:0%

05:56:16.070 --> 05:56:16.080 align:start position:0%
we support policies
 
05:56:17.670 --> 05:56:17.680 align:start position:0%
that support the health and wellness of
 
05:56:19.590 --> 05:56:19.600 align:start position:0%
individuals and supports the public
 
05:56:22.070 --> 05:56:22.080 align:start position:0%
health policy that decrease illness and
 
05:56:24.548 --> 05:56:24.558 align:start position:0%
disease including vaccines and programs
 
05:56:26.788 --> 05:56:26.798 align:start position:0%
like the registry that ensure equitable
 
05:56:28.470 --> 05:56:28.480 align:start position:0%
and efficient broad distribution of
 
05:56:30.708 --> 05:56:30.718 align:start position:0%
vaccines you've heard
 
05:56:33.270 --> 05:56:33.280 align:start position:0%
the importance of the vaccine
 
05:56:35.030 --> 05:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
or of the registry
 
05:56:38.230 --> 05:56:38.240 align:start position:0%
excuse me but also the importance of it
 
05:56:38.240 --> 05:56:38.948 align:start position:0%
excuse me but also the importance of it
to

05:56:38.948 --> 05:56:38.958 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:56:41.030 --> 05:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
individuals into families to keep track
 
05:56:43.350 --> 05:56:43.360 align:start position:0%
of that information as well too it's
 
05:56:46.070 --> 05:56:46.080 align:start position:0%
confidential there are varying ways to
 
05:56:48.390 --> 05:56:48.400 align:start position:0%
there is a way to opt out confidentially
 
05:56:49.430 --> 05:56:49.440 align:start position:0%
as well
 
05:56:51.990 --> 05:56:52.000 align:start position:0%
um so they provide many benefits as you
 
05:56:53.990 --> 05:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
know we were one of the last two in
 
05:56:56.230 --> 05:56:56.240 align:start position:0%
state it um this is just one more
 
05:56:58.150 --> 05:56:58.160 align:start position:0%
attempt to con to weaken the
 
05:57:01.670 --> 05:57:01.680 align:start position:0%
immunization registry um and we feel
 
05:57:03.990 --> 05:57:04.000 align:start position:0%
very important to note that it's fewer
 
05:57:06.230 --> 05:57:06.240 align:start position:0%
than five percent of vaccine recipients
 
05:57:08.230 --> 05:57:08.240 align:start position:0%
have chosen to opt out and most
 
05:57:10.070 --> 05:57:10.080 align:start position:0%
recipients value the importance of the
 
05:57:14.230 --> 05:57:14.240 align:start position:0%
registry so we just um urge you to um
 
05:57:16.150 --> 05:57:16.160 align:start position:0%
uh vote and explain it to legislate on
 
05:57:21.030 --> 05:57:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:25.830 --> 05:57:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:27.510 --> 05:57:27.520 align:start position:0%

05:57:30.390 --> 05:57:30.400 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chairman

i'm andrew prout representing

this bill enhances the existing

non-discrimination section related to
 
05:58:14.310 --> 05:58:14.320 align:start position:0%
the immization vaccine registry

currently rsa 141-c section 20 f
 
05:58:22.310 --> 05:58:22.320 align:start position:0%
roman x requires that and i quote no
 
05:58:24.070 --> 05:58:24.080 align:start position:0%
health care provider shall discriminate
 
05:58:26.548 --> 05:58:26.558 align:start position:0%
in any way against a person solely
 
05:58:26.558 --> 05:58:27.590 align:start position:0%
in any way against a person solely
because

05:58:27.590 --> 05:58:27.600 align:start position:0%
because
 
05:58:29.510 --> 05:58:29.520 align:start position:0%
that person elects not to participate in
 
05:58:32.230 --> 05:58:32.240 align:start position:0%
the immunization registry
 
05:58:34.310 --> 05:58:34.320 align:start position:0%
however paragraph
 
05:58:36.628 --> 05:58:36.638 align:start position:0%
roman 4 permits a larger list of
 
05:58:39.830 --> 05:58:39.840 align:start position:0%
entities access to the registry database
 
05:58:41.750 --> 05:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
including non-healthcare entities such
 
05:58:43.670 --> 05:58:43.680 align:start position:0%
as schools and privately owned child
 
05:58:45.510 --> 05:58:45.520 align:start position:0%
care agencies
 
05:58:47.430 --> 05:58:47.440 align:start position:0%
these entities could use their access to
 
05:58:49.110 --> 05:58:49.120 align:start position:0%
the database to gain knowledge of who is
 
05:58:50.708 --> 05:58:50.718 align:start position:0%
opted out of the database
 
05:58:52.310 --> 05:58:52.320 align:start position:0%
and are free to discriminate on that
 
05:58:55.510 --> 05:58:55.520 align:start position:0%
basis under current law
 
05:58:57.030 --> 05:58:57.040 align:start position:0%
these entities may be financially
 
05:58:59.030 --> 05:58:59.040 align:start position:0%
incentivized to do just that
 
05:59:00.868 --> 05:59:00.878 align:start position:0%
a daycare may decide it's easier to
 
05:59:02.708 --> 05:59:02.718 align:start position:0%
require all children to participate in
 
05:59:05.030 --> 05:59:05.040 align:start position:0%
the registry rather than hound parents
 
05:59:07.110 --> 05:59:07.120 align:start position:0%
for up-to-date health records
 
05:59:08.628 --> 05:59:08.638 align:start position:0%
i must unfortunately admit i've been on
 
05:59:12.390 --> 05:59:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:13.990 --> 05:59:14.000 align:start position:0%
the staff time previously spent
 
05:59:15.350 --> 05:59:15.360 align:start position:0%
following up with parents would be
 
05:59:16.868 --> 05:59:16.878 align:start position:0%
realized as a cost savings for that
 
05:59:19.830 --> 05:59:19.840 align:start position:0%
child care agency
 
05:59:21.430 --> 05:59:21.440 align:start position:0%
we have enshrined in our law right to
 
05:59:23.350 --> 05:59:23.360 align:start position:0%
opt out of the registry however this
 
05:59:25.030 --> 05:59:25.040 align:start position:0%
right is meaningless if coercive
 
05:59:27.030 --> 05:59:27.040 align:start position:0%
pressure not to use that opt-out
 
05:59:27.040 --> 05:59:28.310 align:start position:0%
pressure not to use that opt-out
provision

05:59:28.310 --> 05:59:28.320 align:start position:0%
provision
 
05:59:30.628 --> 05:59:30.638 align:start position:0%
is allowed to be put on individuals and
 
05:59:30.638 --> 05:59:32.230 align:start position:0%
is allowed to be put on individuals and
families

05:59:32.230 --> 05:59:32.240 align:start position:0%
families
 
05:59:33.830 --> 05:59:33.840 align:start position:0%
i asked you find this bill ought to pass
 
05:59:35.190 --> 05:59:35.200 align:start position:0%
ensure the state granted right of
 
05:59:37.270 --> 05:59:37.280 align:start position:0%
registry access is never allowed to be
 
05:59:39.350 --> 05:59:39.360 align:start position:0%
used for discrimination
 
05:59:40.788 --> 05:59:40.798 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time consideration be
 
05:59:42.310 --> 05:59:42.320 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions any
 
05:59:46.070 --> 05:59:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:48.230 --> 05:59:48.240 align:start position:0%
representative nutteruppum had your hand
 
05:59:50.470 --> 05:59:50.480 align:start position:0%
up first
 
05:59:52.230 --> 05:59:52.240 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman and thank you for
 
05:59:55.830 --> 05:59:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:59.110 --> 05:59:59.120 align:start position:0%
how are people discriminated against
 
06:00:02.548 --> 06:00:02.558 align:start position:0%
by opting you mentioned daycare
 
06:00:04.230 --> 06:00:04.240 align:start position:0%
do you have other examples i'm a little
 
06:00:05.750 --> 06:00:05.760 align:start position:0%
confused by
 
06:00:06.948 --> 06:00:06.958 align:start position:0%
how you were
 
06:00:09.030 --> 06:00:09.040 align:start position:0%
discriminated against by opting out of
 
06:00:09.040 --> 06:00:10.628 align:start position:0%
discriminated against by opting out of
something

06:00:10.628 --> 06:00:10.638 align:start position:0%
something
 
06:00:12.070 --> 06:00:12.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
06:00:12.080 --> 06:00:12.948 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
um

06:00:12.948 --> 06:00:12.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:00:14.310 --> 06:00:14.320 align:start position:0%
i mentioned daycare is one of the
 
06:00:16.548 --> 06:00:16.558 align:start position:0%
concerns of i mean it's
 
06:00:18.390 --> 06:00:18.400 align:start position:0%
difficult to say all the ways this might
 
06:00:21.430 --> 06:00:21.440 align:start position:0%
happen uh the the vaccine immunization
 
06:00:23.750 --> 06:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
registry is just getting booted up now
 
06:00:25.350 --> 06:00:25.360 align:start position:0%
it's been theorized for a long time just
 
06:00:26.708 --> 06:00:26.718 align:start position:0%
happening and i want to get ahead of
 
06:00:28.070 --> 06:00:28.080 align:start position:0%
that and i noticed in the law it says
 
06:00:29.430 --> 06:00:29.440 align:start position:0%
that health care providers are not
 
06:00:31.030 --> 06:00:31.040 align:start position:0%
allowed to discriminate
 
06:00:32.628 --> 06:00:32.638 align:start position:0%
but there's more than just health care
 
06:00:34.948 --> 06:00:34.958 align:start position:0%
providers allowed access to the registry
 
06:00:36.708 --> 06:00:36.718 align:start position:0%
and that just didn't make sense to me
 
06:00:38.948 --> 06:00:38.958 align:start position:0%
that implicitly in the distinction being
 
06:00:40.070 --> 06:00:40.080 align:start position:0%
drawn there
 
06:00:41.990 --> 06:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
were saying that other people could
 
06:00:44.230 --> 06:00:44.240 align:start position:0%
discriminate and i gave the example of
 
06:00:46.230 --> 06:00:46.240 align:start position:0%
daycare providers possibly similar for
 
06:00:46.240 --> 06:00:47.750 align:start position:0%
daycare providers possibly similar for
schools

06:00:47.750 --> 06:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
schools
 
06:00:49.750 --> 06:00:49.760 align:start position:0%
they may want to you know say that
 
06:00:51.510 --> 06:00:51.520 align:start position:0%
everyone all the students in their
 
06:00:53.510 --> 06:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
school must participate in the registry
 
06:00:54.868 --> 06:00:54.878 align:start position:0%
either to make it administratively
 
06:00:58.070 --> 06:00:58.080 align:start position:0%
easier or because of
 
06:00:58.080 --> 06:00:58.788 align:start position:0%
easier or because of
that

06:00:58.788 --> 06:00:58.798 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:01:00.628 --> 06:01:00.638 align:start position:0%
that's the belief they want to carry
 
06:01:00.638 --> 06:01:02.150 align:start position:0%
that's the belief they want to carry
forward

06:01:02.150 --> 06:01:02.160 align:start position:0%
forward
 
06:01:03.590 --> 06:01:03.600 align:start position:0%
uh follow-up
 
06:01:03.600 --> 06:01:05.030 align:start position:0%
uh follow-up
follow-up

06:01:05.030 --> 06:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
06:01:08.708 --> 06:01:08.718 align:start position:0%
i think children in school are already
 
06:01:10.150 --> 06:01:10.160 align:start position:0%
have to have their immunizations to
 
06:01:12.708 --> 06:01:12.718 align:start position:0%
attend school for the moment
 
06:01:12.718 --> 06:01:16.548 align:start position:0%
attend school for the moment
um

06:01:16.548 --> 06:01:16.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:18.868 --> 06:01:18.878 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question okay sorry um
 
06:01:21.270 --> 06:01:21.280 align:start position:0%
uh yes that is true but they don't have
 
06:01:22.708 --> 06:01:22.718 align:start position:0%
to their parent they and their parents
 
06:01:24.868 --> 06:01:24.878 align:start position:0%
don't have to allow the state registry
 
06:01:26.868 --> 06:01:26.878 align:start position:0%
to maintain those records they can
 
06:01:28.310 --> 06:01:28.320 align:start position:0%
provide those records directly from
 
06:01:31.190 --> 06:01:31.200 align:start position:0%
their provider to the school
 
06:01:32.868 --> 06:01:32.878 align:start position:0%
instead of using the state registry as
 
06:01:35.430 --> 06:01:35.440 align:start position:0%
the method of transmission
 
06:01:36.708 --> 06:01:36.718 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
06:01:41.030 --> 06:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:42.868 --> 06:01:42.878 align:start position:0%
you may have already partially answered
 
06:01:45.910 --> 06:01:45.920 align:start position:0%
this but my question was
 
06:01:47.750 --> 06:01:47.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be within the purview of a
 
06:01:51.990 --> 06:01:52.000 align:start position:0%
private daycare provider
 
06:01:52.000 --> 06:01:55.350 align:start position:0%
private daycare provider
to

06:01:55.350 --> 06:01:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:56.390 --> 06:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
make whatever
 
06:01:58.628 --> 06:01:58.638 align:start position:0%
regulations they
 
06:02:01.190 --> 06:02:01.200 align:start position:0%
preferred for their daycare business and

parents get to either come and accept
 
06:02:03.280 --> 06:02:04.230 align:start position:0%
parents get to either come and accept
their

06:02:04.230 --> 06:02:04.240 align:start position:0%
their
 
06:02:05.990 --> 06:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
regulations or
 
06:02:07.830 --> 06:02:07.840 align:start position:0%
find a different daycare provider isn't
 
06:02:11.030 --> 06:02:11.040 align:start position:0%
that an individual choice
 
06:02:13.670 --> 06:02:13.680 align:start position:0%
and individual freedom of choice on
 
06:02:15.990 --> 06:02:16.000 align:start position:0%
the part of the business owner
 
06:02:17.830 --> 06:02:17.840 align:start position:0%
with respect to a private day care
 
06:02:20.708 --> 06:02:20.718 align:start position:0%
provider not all these other things
 
06:02:24.788 --> 06:02:24.798 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um
 
06:02:26.390 --> 06:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
i think the important factor here is
 
06:02:28.548 --> 06:02:28.558 align:start position:0%
that even a private day care provider or
 
06:02:30.470 --> 06:02:30.480 align:start position:0%
private school for that matter
 
06:02:32.628 --> 06:02:32.638 align:start position:0%
would only be able to enforce that and
 
06:02:34.310 --> 06:02:34.320 align:start position:0%
actually know if someone participated in
 
06:02:36.708 --> 06:02:36.718 align:start position:0%
the state operated database
 
06:02:39.270 --> 06:02:39.280 align:start position:0%
because of the special access given to
 
06:02:42.150 --> 06:02:42.160 align:start position:0%
them by the state in our rsa to have
 
06:02:44.470 --> 06:02:44.480 align:start position:0%
direct access to that database
 
06:02:44.480 --> 06:02:45.750 align:start position:0%
direct access to that database
so

06:02:45.750 --> 06:02:45.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:02:46.948 --> 06:02:46.958 align:start position:0%
what you said applies to many
 
06:02:49.430 --> 06:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
circumstances but when the state is a
 
06:02:50.868 --> 06:02:50.878 align:start position:0%
party to
 
06:02:52.948 --> 06:02:52.958 align:start position:0%
the issue at hand
 
06:02:54.548 --> 06:02:54.558 align:start position:0%
i think we have to look at what state
 
06:02:56.628 --> 06:02:56.638 align:start position:0%
law authorizes and what it regulates
 
06:02:59.190 --> 06:02:59.200 align:start position:0%
regarding that privately owned schools
 
06:03:01.350 --> 06:03:01.360 align:start position:0%
use of their state granted access to a
 
06:03:08.628 --> 06:03:08.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:08.638 --> 06:03:09.670 align:start position:0%
 
merchant

06:03:09.670 --> 06:03:09.680 align:start position:0%
merchant
 
06:03:12.310 --> 06:03:12.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman also thank you for
 
06:03:13.830 --> 06:03:13.840 align:start position:0%
taking the question
 
06:03:15.750 --> 06:03:15.760 align:start position:0%
what i'm trying this is following up on
 
06:03:19.110 --> 06:03:19.120 align:start position:0%
representative webber's question
 
06:03:20.548 --> 06:03:20.558 align:start position:0%
are we going down slippery slope or
 
06:03:21.910 --> 06:03:21.920 align:start position:0%
telling the business how to run their
 
06:03:21.920 --> 06:03:24.150 align:start position:0%
telling the business how to run their
business

06:03:24.150 --> 06:03:24.160 align:start position:0%
business
 
06:03:26.310 --> 06:03:26.320 align:start position:0%
because at that point in time
 
06:03:28.868 --> 06:03:28.878 align:start position:0%
if they decide to have vaccinations part
 
06:03:30.070 --> 06:03:30.080 align:start position:0%
of the reason for their business and
 
06:03:32.150 --> 06:03:32.160 align:start position:0%
it's a business decision they make which
 
06:03:34.708 --> 06:03:34.718 align:start position:0%
we want to respect in the state are we
 
06:03:36.628 --> 06:03:36.638 align:start position:0%
not somehow starting to infringe upon
 
06:03:39.190 --> 06:03:39.200 align:start position:0%
their independence as a business person
 
06:03:41.750 --> 06:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
to make that decision
 
06:03:44.470 --> 06:03:44.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question and
 
06:03:45.590 --> 06:03:45.600 align:start position:0%
i guess i'll start with the
 
06:03:47.670 --> 06:03:47.680 align:start position:0%
clarification that this wouldn't change
 
06:03:50.708 --> 06:03:50.718 align:start position:0%
what vaccinations would be required
 
06:03:52.310 --> 06:03:52.320 align:start position:0%
and also this section law doesn't
 
06:03:53.990 --> 06:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
address whether a
 
06:03:55.510 --> 06:03:55.520 align:start position:0%
privately owned daycare or school can
 
06:03:57.510 --> 06:03:57.520 align:start position:0%
exceed those state requirements that's
 
06:04:00.150 --> 06:04:00.160 align:start position:0%
not the topic at hand
 
06:04:03.430 --> 06:04:03.440 align:start position:0%
this is only whether those schools can
 
06:04:04.708 --> 06:04:04.718 align:start position:0%
use their
 
06:04:08.788 --> 06:04:08.798 align:start position:0%
special access to a state database
 
06:04:10.628 --> 06:04:10.638 align:start position:0%
to require you to enroll in a state
 
06:04:13.110 --> 06:04:13.120 align:start position:0%
program which is the vaccine registry
 
06:04:15.350 --> 06:04:15.360 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't address the topic whether
 
06:04:17.590 --> 06:04:17.600 align:start position:0%
all children have to be vaccinated to
 
06:04:18.868 --> 06:04:18.878 align:start position:0%
attend school or daycare it doesn't
 
06:04:21.430 --> 06:04:21.440 align:start position:0%
address the topic whether a particular
 
06:04:23.030 --> 06:04:23.040 align:start position:0%
school or daycare could exceed the state
 
06:04:29.030 --> 06:04:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:32.390 --> 06:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:34.548 --> 06:04:34.558 align:start position:0%
so basically
 
06:04:36.948 --> 06:04:36.958 align:start position:0%
way i understand this
 
06:04:40.868 --> 06:04:40.878 align:start position:0%
it's going to be incumbent upon the
 
06:04:43.590 --> 06:04:43.600 align:start position:0%
parent or the individual to provide that
 
06:04:45.910 --> 06:04:45.920 align:start position:0%
data if it's not in the database to the
 
06:04:48.070 --> 06:04:48.080 align:start position:0%
individual that wants to have it in
 
06:04:49.350 --> 06:04:49.360 align:start position:0%
other words if i went to a private
 
06:04:52.310 --> 06:04:52.320 align:start position:0%
school the school wanted to have my
 
06:04:54.070 --> 06:04:54.080 align:start position:0%
database for vaccination which is
 
06:04:56.628 --> 06:04:56.638 align:start position:0%
required if it's not in the database i
 
06:04:58.470 --> 06:04:58.480 align:start position:0%
therefore have to just have to provide
 
06:05:01.910 --> 06:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
it to them is that what i'm hearing
 
06:05:03.270 --> 06:05:03.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question yes it would
 
06:05:05.750 --> 06:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
be they would have to provide what is
 
06:05:07.750 --> 06:05:07.760 align:start position:0%
currently done in many places which is
 
06:05:08.948 --> 06:05:08.958 align:start position:0%
your current health care provider
 
06:05:10.708 --> 06:05:10.718 align:start position:0%
selling a health form which includes all
 
06:05:13.350 --> 06:05:13.360 align:start position:0%
the information on
 
06:05:15.750 --> 06:05:15.760 align:start position:0%
the the child's vaccination records in
 
06:05:18.708 --> 06:05:18.718 align:start position:0%
this example um and that would
 
06:05:20.310 --> 06:05:20.320 align:start position:0%
and the school would i assume you have
 
06:05:22.948 --> 06:05:22.958 align:start position:0%
to accept that they just cannot say the
 
06:05:25.270 --> 06:05:25.280 align:start position:0%
only way we accept the information is
 
06:05:29.270 --> 06:05:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:33.990 --> 06:05:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:35.670 --> 06:05:35.680 align:start position:0%
i'm waving off because i had the same
 
06:05:38.150 --> 06:05:38.160 align:start position:0%
exact question any other questions for
 
06:05:41.750 --> 06:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:43.910 --> 06:05:43.920 align:start position:0%

on this bill
 
06:06:24.548 --> 06:06:24.558 align:start position:0%
since uh no individual is required
 
06:06:27.110 --> 06:06:27.120 align:start position:0%
to participate in the iis
 
06:06:30.868 --> 06:06:30.878 align:start position:0%

06:06:56.628 --> 06:06:56.638 align:start position:0%
reasonable to amend this rsa to include

bill

06:07:35.750 --> 06:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:07:37.190 --> 06:07:37.200 align:start position:0%
this bill is important because the
 
06:07:39.430 --> 06:07:39.440 align:start position:0%
registry does not restrict access by
 
06:07:41.270 --> 06:07:41.280 align:start position:0%
daycares and schools and doctors to
 
06:07:44.470 --> 06:07:44.480 align:start position:0%
current clients students patients or
 
06:07:44.480 --> 06:07:45.670 align:start position:0%

06:07:45.670 --> 06:07:45.680 align:start position:0%
customers
 
06:07:47.750 --> 06:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
without this bill those not in the
 
06:07:50.548 --> 06:07:50.558 align:start position:0%
registry or those who may have
 
06:07:52.868 --> 06:07:52.878 align:start position:0%
declined one or more vaccines remember
 
06:07:54.628 --> 06:07:54.638 align:start position:0%
you can be swept in if you've declined
 
06:07:56.628 --> 06:07:56.638 align:start position:0%
vaccines to be spied on and
 
06:07:59.030 --> 06:07:59.040 align:start position:0%
discriminated against
 
06:08:02.070 --> 06:08:02.080 align:start position:0%
for in particular day day private day
 
06:08:04.948 --> 06:08:04.958 align:start position:0%
care services so it could be used as a
 
06:08:07.030 --> 06:08:07.040 align:start position:0%
screening mechanism to
 
06:08:08.628 --> 06:08:08.638 align:start position:0%
deny services
 
06:08:10.708 --> 06:08:10.718 align:start position:0%
and no one should be allowed to
 
06:08:13.430 --> 06:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
discriminate based on an individual's
 
06:08:15.270 --> 06:08:15.280 align:start position:0%
privacy right decisions now it's been
 
06:08:17.030 --> 06:08:17.040 align:start position:0%
raised here the question well in a
 
06:08:19.430 --> 06:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
daycare does a parent have to provide
 
06:08:22.788 --> 06:08:22.798 align:start position:0%
information about vaccination yes indeed
 
06:08:25.270 --> 06:08:25.280 align:start position:0%
state law requires certain vaccines for
 
06:08:27.990 --> 06:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
children entering daycares public or
 
06:08:30.230 --> 06:08:30.240 align:start position:0%
private a parent must provide that
 
06:08:34.230 --> 06:08:34.240 align:start position:0%
information or a medical or a religious
 
06:08:36.628 --> 06:08:36.638 align:start position:0%
exemption so there's not necessarily a
 
06:08:39.110 --> 06:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
vaccination record um
 
06:08:41.510 --> 06:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
and you know absent you know if a parent
 
06:08:43.670 --> 06:08:43.680 align:start position:0%
submits a religious exemption then based
 
06:08:46.470 --> 06:08:46.480 align:start position:0%
on those religious beliefs a prospective
 
06:08:48.708 --> 06:08:48.718 align:start position:0%
daycare provider could spy on that
 
06:08:51.430 --> 06:08:51.440 align:start position:0%
parent to see you know if their child is
 
06:08:54.868 --> 06:08:54.878 align:start position:0%
in the registry um so again i believe
 
06:08:56.390 --> 06:08:56.400 align:start position:0%
this is um
 
06:08:58.708 --> 06:08:58.718 align:start position:0%
a needed amendment to current law and i
 
06:09:00.708 --> 06:09:00.718 align:start position:0%
appreciate the support on this bill and
 
06:09:02.230 --> 06:09:02.240 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to take any questions thank
 
06:09:02.240 --> 06:09:07.510 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to take any questions thank
you

06:09:07.510 --> 06:09:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:09.110 --> 06:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
you weren't ready for me to end that
 
06:09:11.510 --> 06:09:11.520 align:start position:0%
quickly were you
 
06:09:13.190 --> 06:09:13.200 align:start position:0%
yeah i have the habit of going a little
 
06:09:14.788 --> 06:09:14.798 align:start position:0%
longer trying to be quick
 
06:09:17.590 --> 06:09:17.600 align:start position:0%
i owe you a minute and four seconds
 
06:09:19.670 --> 06:09:19.680 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome i keep track
 
06:09:21.990 --> 06:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes jennifer smith from
 
06:09:27.910 --> 06:09:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:29.670 --> 06:09:29.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and members of the
 
06:09:32.628 --> 06:09:32.638 align:start position:0%
committee for taking my testimony
 
06:09:34.948 --> 06:09:34.958 align:start position:0%
i apologize again for not being able to
 
06:09:36.948 --> 06:09:36.958 align:start position:0%
state that i am representing the public
 
06:09:38.868 --> 06:09:38.878 align:start position:0%
health association
 
06:09:41.030 --> 06:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
because we're a little bit disorganized
 
06:09:42.868 --> 06:09:42.878 align:start position:0%
this year and there's just way too many
 
06:09:44.788 --> 06:09:44.798 align:start position:0%
bills to keep track of and we didn't
 
06:09:47.110 --> 06:09:47.120 align:start position:0%
keep track of this one i'm afraid
 
06:09:50.070 --> 06:09:50.080 align:start position:0%
but i think we would be opposed
 
06:09:52.868 --> 06:09:52.878 align:start position:0%
i am opposed and i want to talk about
 
06:09:55.270 --> 06:09:55.280 align:start position:0%
this section is about communicable
 
06:09:57.190 --> 06:09:57.200 align:start position:0%
disease and sometimes i think people
 
06:10:00.070 --> 06:10:00.080 align:start position:0%
lose sight of what that means
 
06:10:02.470 --> 06:10:02.480 align:start position:0%
as a physician with a fair amount of
 
06:10:05.350 --> 06:10:05.360 align:start position:0%
expertise and communicable disease this
 
06:10:06.948 --> 06:10:06.958 align:start position:0%
alarms me
 
06:10:10.390 --> 06:10:10.400 align:start position:0%
to read shall not well no health care or
 
06:10:13.910 --> 06:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
provider any other entity identified
 
06:10:17.030 --> 06:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
shall discriminate in any way
 
06:10:19.670 --> 06:10:19.680 align:start position:0%
and that really gets problematic with
 
06:10:22.230 --> 06:10:22.240 align:start position:0%
some of the communicable diseases
 
06:10:24.470 --> 06:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
yeah i i actually ask a former health
 
06:10:26.470 --> 06:10:26.480 align:start position:0%
care provider i retired some time ago
 
06:10:28.230 --> 06:10:28.240 align:start position:0%
and i could have answered some of the
 
06:10:30.230 --> 06:10:30.240 align:start position:0%
questions about primary care that were
 
06:10:32.230 --> 06:10:32.240 align:start position:0%
up before
 
06:10:34.470 --> 06:10:34.480 align:start position:0%
but you know your committee hearings
 
06:10:38.310 --> 06:10:38.320 align:start position:0%
aren't going too long and i i do think
 
06:10:41.510 --> 06:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
that this has some real problems to do
 
06:10:43.190 --> 06:10:43.200 align:start position:0%
this and
 
06:10:45.110 --> 06:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
the problems have been somewhat
 
06:10:45.120 --> 06:10:46.628 align:start position:0%
the problems have been somewhat
identified

06:10:46.628 --> 06:10:46.638 align:start position:0%
identified
 
06:10:46.638 --> 06:10:47.510 align:start position:0%
identified
that

06:10:47.510 --> 06:10:47.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:10:51.030 --> 06:10:51.040 align:start position:0%
people need to be able to know if they
 
06:10:52.390 --> 06:10:52.400 align:start position:0%
are running
 
06:10:54.788 --> 06:10:54.798 align:start position:0%
these other entities
 
06:10:57.270 --> 06:10:57.280 align:start position:0%
that they can assure
 
06:10:57.280 --> 06:10:59.030 align:start position:0%
that they can assure
their

06:10:59.030 --> 06:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
their
 
06:10:59.040 --> 06:11:00.470 align:start position:0%
their
clients

06:11:00.470 --> 06:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
clients
 
06:11:02.548 --> 06:11:02.558 align:start position:0%
that in point of fact
 
06:11:04.708 --> 06:11:04.718 align:start position:0%
they are doing everything they can to
 
06:11:04.718 --> 06:11:06.628 align:start position:0%
they are doing everything they can to
prevent

06:11:06.628 --> 06:11:06.638 align:start position:0%
prevent
 
06:11:09.670 --> 06:11:09.680 align:start position:0%
serious communicable diseases going home
 
06:11:12.390 --> 06:11:12.400 align:start position:0%
with their child if it's a school or a
 
06:11:14.470 --> 06:11:14.480 align:start position:0%
daycare center
 
06:11:17.190 --> 06:11:17.200 align:start position:0%
and there are communicable diseases that
 
06:11:19.910 --> 06:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
resurge quite regularly
 
06:11:21.510 --> 06:11:21.520 align:start position:0%
when too many
 
06:11:21.520 --> 06:11:22.390 align:start position:0%
when too many
kids

06:11:22.390 --> 06:11:22.400 align:start position:0%
kids
 
06:11:23.830 --> 06:11:23.840 align:start position:0%
or adults
 
06:11:25.350 --> 06:11:25.360 align:start position:0%
end up there
 
06:11:28.230 --> 06:11:28.240 align:start position:0%
with no vaccination
 
06:11:31.110 --> 06:11:31.120 align:start position:0%
two in particular worry me a lot one is
 
06:11:32.548 --> 06:11:32.558 align:start position:0%
whooping cough
 
06:11:34.868 --> 06:11:34.878 align:start position:0%
whooping cough can kill infants who have
 
06:11:39.350 --> 06:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
not yet been able to be vaccinated
 
06:11:42.708 --> 06:11:42.718 align:start position:0%
and whooping cough recurs regularly when
 
06:11:45.190 --> 06:11:45.200 align:start position:0%
people aren't vaccinated
 
06:11:49.270 --> 06:11:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:51.350 --> 06:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
and i could go into great detail about
 
06:11:53.430 --> 06:11:53.440 align:start position:0%
why that is just a reminder that we're
 
06:11:56.708 --> 06:11:56.718 align:start position:0%
in the three minutes zone here all right
 
06:11:58.628 --> 06:11:58.638 align:start position:0%
so i could go into great detail but i
 
06:12:00.310 --> 06:12:00.320 align:start position:0%
won't the other one that worries me a
 
06:12:02.708 --> 06:12:02.718 align:start position:0%
lot is something that very few people
 
06:12:04.470 --> 06:12:04.480 align:start position:0%
really pay attention to and that is
 
06:12:04.480 --> 06:12:05.590 align:start position:0%
really pay attention to and that is
rubella

06:12:05.590 --> 06:12:05.600 align:start position:0%
rubella
 
06:12:09.030 --> 06:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
known to some people as german measles
 
06:12:12.788 --> 06:12:12.798 align:start position:0%
that is something that if a woman
 
06:12:14.628 --> 06:12:14.638 align:start position:0%
failed her vaccination and that does
 
06:12:14.638 --> 06:12:15.670 align:start position:0%
failed her vaccination and that does
happen

06:12:15.670 --> 06:12:15.680 align:start position:0%
happen
 
06:12:18.390 --> 06:12:18.400 align:start position:0%
and a child comes home from a school or
 
06:12:20.788 --> 06:12:20.798 align:start position:0%
a daycare while she is pregnant
 
06:12:23.510 --> 06:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
could cause a disaster for that
 
06:12:23.520 --> 06:12:24.868 align:start position:0%
could cause a disaster for that
pregnancy

06:12:24.868 --> 06:12:24.878 align:start position:0%
pregnancy
 
06:12:27.430 --> 06:12:27.440 align:start position:0%
so i won't go further i can detail that
 
06:12:29.590 --> 06:12:29.600 align:start position:0%
if you want but i've been warned about
 
06:12:31.510 --> 06:12:31.520 align:start position:0%
the time limit thank you
 
06:12:35.030 --> 06:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:38.070 --> 06:12:38.080 align:start position:0%
representative cushman with a question
 
06:12:39.590 --> 06:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman would you take a
 
06:12:42.708 --> 06:12:42.718 align:start position:0%
question of of course um thank you
 
06:12:42.718 --> 06:12:44.150 align:start position:0%
question of of course um thank you
um

06:12:44.150 --> 06:12:44.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:12:44.160 --> 06:12:45.510 align:start position:0%
um
so

06:12:45.510 --> 06:12:45.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:12:48.070 --> 06:12:48.080 align:start position:0%
does anything in this bill prevent
 
06:12:48.080 --> 06:12:49.030 align:start position:0%
does anything in this bill prevent
the

06:12:49.030 --> 06:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:12:51.030 --> 06:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
as you see it i know you didn't write it
 
06:12:51.040 --> 06:12:52.070 align:start position:0%
as you see it i know you didn't write it
but

06:12:52.070 --> 06:12:52.080 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:12:54.310 --> 06:12:54.320 align:start position:0%
the way i read it nothing in it prevents
 
06:12:56.708 --> 06:12:56.718 align:start position:0%
uh the daycare facility
 
06:12:59.190 --> 06:12:59.200 align:start position:0%
from complying with existing law and
 
06:13:01.270 --> 06:13:01.280 align:start position:0%
ensuring that they maintain
 
06:13:03.270 --> 06:13:03.280 align:start position:0%
vaccination records for all those
 
06:13:04.868 --> 06:13:04.878 align:start position:0%
children enrolled
 
06:13:07.270 --> 06:13:07.280 align:start position:0%
but it does say to shall discriminate in
 
06:13:10.788 --> 06:13:10.798 align:start position:0%
any way and if you have multiple
 
06:13:13.350 --> 06:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
people coming in who
 
06:13:16.070 --> 06:13:16.080 align:start position:0%
are not in the vaccine registry and have
 
06:13:18.628 --> 06:13:18.638 align:start position:0%
presented to their physicians that they
 
06:13:21.670 --> 06:13:21.680 align:start position:0%
have a religious exemption
 
06:13:22.948 --> 06:13:22.958 align:start position:0%
now maybe
 
06:13:25.030 --> 06:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
if you rewrite this bill you can make
 
06:13:28.310 --> 06:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
clear that the private entity
 
06:13:29.750 --> 06:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
or the school
 
06:13:31.030 --> 06:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
is allowed
 
06:13:34.150 --> 06:13:34.160 align:start position:0%
to say no you can't come in because we
 
06:13:37.110 --> 06:13:37.120 align:start position:0%
have this requirement you know it's a
 
06:13:39.670 --> 06:13:39.680 align:start position:0%
slippery slope in many ways and i guess
 
06:13:41.830 --> 06:13:41.840 align:start position:0%
the one that worries me most is the
 
06:13:41.840 --> 06:13:43.190 align:start position:0%
the one that worries me most is the
adult

06:13:43.190 --> 06:13:43.200 align:start position:0%
adult
 
06:13:45.590 --> 06:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
employee saying i'm going to sue you for
 
06:13:49.590 --> 06:13:49.600 align:start position:0%
not keeping me employed or employing me
 
06:13:53.110 --> 06:13:53.120 align:start position:0%
when they refuse to be immunized against
 
06:13:55.750 --> 06:13:55.760 align:start position:0%
things that they could transmit
 
06:13:58.788 --> 06:13:58.798 align:start position:0%
that could be disasters for other people
 
06:14:01.030 --> 06:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
maybe you can rewrite this in some way i
 
06:14:06.628 --> 06:14:06.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:12.788 --> 06:14:12.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:18.150 --> 06:14:18.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:20.628 --> 06:14:20.638 align:start position:0%
our next
 
06:14:22.948 --> 06:14:22.958 align:start position:0%
hearing is scheduled for 3 o'clock and i
 
06:14:26.708 --> 06:14:26.718 align:start position:0%
think we can sneak an exec session in
 
06:14:32.150 --> 06:14:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:34.150 --> 06:14:34.160 align:start position:0%
what is there a question of the chair if
 
06:14:36.788 --> 06:14:36.798 align:start position:0%
so stated so i can hear it
 
06:14:38.150 --> 06:14:38.160 align:start position:0%
no thank you
 
06:14:39.510 --> 06:14:39.520 align:start position:0%
all right
 
06:14:43.750 --> 06:14:43.760 align:start position:0%
open the exact session on house bill one
 
06:14:48.070 --> 06:14:48.080 align:start position:0%
zero zero three and there are there is
 
06:14:58.868 --> 06:14:58.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:01.030 --> 06:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
a few more
 
06:15:03.270 --> 06:15:03.280 align:start position:0%
a few more
 
06:15:05.990 --> 06:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
and this is uh representative cushman's
 
06:15:06.000 --> 06:15:08.470 align:start position:0%
and this is uh representative cushman's
bill

06:15:08.470 --> 06:15:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:12.230 --> 06:15:12.240 align:start position:0%
you get extra credit as a homeschooler
 
06:15:18.708 --> 06:15:18.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:20.628 --> 06:15:20.638 align:start position:0%
remember we heard this bill we thought
 
06:15:22.788 --> 06:15:22.798 align:start position:0%
maybe some tweaking would make it better
 
06:15:25.590 --> 06:15:25.600 align:start position:0%
and the amendment is the attempt
 
06:15:35.910 --> 06:15:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:40.070 --> 06:15:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:41.670 --> 06:15:41.680 align:start position:0%
i can't hear you
 
06:15:44.390 --> 06:15:44.400 align:start position:0%
my apologies my understanding was that
 
06:15:46.788 --> 06:15:46.798 align:start position:0%
we had some bills that were ready to go
 
06:15:49.110 --> 06:15:49.120 align:start position:0%
that didn't need amendments and i'm very
 
06:15:50.868 --> 06:15:50.878 align:start position:0%
concerned about
 
06:15:53.350 --> 06:15:53.360 align:start position:0%
um having to exact something with an
 
06:15:56.310 --> 06:15:56.320 align:start position:0%
amendment we've only just seen
 
06:15:59.350 --> 06:15:59.360 align:start position:0%
it has two sentences and i choose to go
 
06:16:02.390 --> 06:16:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:02.400 --> 06:16:06.868 align:start position:0%
 
okay

06:16:06.868 --> 06:16:06.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:26.788 --> 06:16:26.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:28.948 --> 06:16:28.958 align:start position:0%
representative cushman would you care to
 
06:16:31.670 --> 06:16:31.680 align:start position:0%
explain any material difference between
 
06:16:33.910 --> 06:16:33.920 align:start position:0%
the bill and the amendment as we put
 
06:16:35.910 --> 06:16:35.920 align:start position:0%
them side by side
 
06:16:38.150 --> 06:16:38.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman yes so
 
06:16:40.708 --> 06:16:40.718 align:start position:0%
representative merchant and i worked on
 
06:16:44.390 --> 06:16:44.400 align:start position:0%
um well he signed off on an amendment
 
06:16:46.310 --> 06:16:46.320 align:start position:0%
that i crafted
 
06:16:50.628 --> 06:16:50.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:53.190 --> 06:16:53.200 align:start position:0%
preferences for what it should say after
 
06:16:55.110 --> 06:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
considering what we discussed in the
 
06:16:55.120 --> 06:16:56.708 align:start position:0%
considering what we discussed in the
hearing

06:16:56.708 --> 06:16:56.718 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
06:16:59.190 --> 06:16:59.200 align:start position:0%
so it inserts the language into the
 
06:17:01.270 --> 06:17:01.280 align:start position:0%
patient bill of rights
 
06:17:03.110 --> 06:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
and it changes the
 
06:17:03.120 --> 06:17:04.470 align:start position:0%
and it changes the
um

06:17:04.470 --> 06:17:04.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:17:07.510 --> 06:17:07.520 align:start position:0%
changes it from the provider shall not
 
06:17:09.910 --> 06:17:09.920 align:start position:0%
or the facility shall not
 
06:17:12.470 --> 06:17:12.480 align:start position:0%
to the patient shall not be
 
06:17:14.868 --> 06:17:14.878 align:start position:0%
denied admission care or services based
 
06:17:17.430 --> 06:17:17.440 align:start position:0%
and then i inserted the word solely
 
06:17:19.910 --> 06:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
which i believe was representative
 
06:17:22.470 --> 06:17:22.480 align:start position:0%
canerx suggested and i'm sorry if it was
 
06:17:24.470 --> 06:17:24.480 align:start position:0%
someone else
 
06:17:27.270 --> 06:17:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:28.628 --> 06:17:28.638 align:start position:0%
after what was
 
06:17:30.948 --> 06:17:30.958 align:start position:0%
said in the hearing and
 
06:17:32.948 --> 06:17:32.958 align:start position:0%
so this this takes the burden off of
 
06:17:34.868 --> 06:17:34.878 align:start position:0%
individual providers as was one of the
 
06:17:36.708 --> 06:17:36.718 align:start position:0%
concerns and it places it just on the
 
06:17:38.548 --> 06:17:38.558 align:start position:0%
facility it's just included in the
 
06:17:40.470 --> 06:17:40.480 align:start position:0%
patient bill of rights this is a right
 
06:17:42.708 --> 06:17:42.718 align:start position:0%
that a patient has they can't be denied
 
06:17:45.670 --> 06:17:45.680 align:start position:0%
the care just based on their vaccination
 
06:17:45.680 --> 06:17:49.270 align:start position:0%
the care just based on their vaccination
status

06:17:49.270 --> 06:17:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:50.708 --> 06:17:50.718 align:start position:0%
would you care to speak to this
 
06:17:52.948 --> 06:17:52.958 align:start position:0%
representative merchant
 
06:17:54.708 --> 06:17:54.718 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and also thank you
 
06:17:57.030 --> 06:17:57.040 align:start position:0%
for the question for uh running this by
 
06:17:58.708 --> 06:17:58.718 align:start position:0%
me and working with me so to speak on it
 
06:18:00.390 --> 06:18:00.400 align:start position:0%
as well and explaining it i think the
 
06:18:02.310 --> 06:18:02.320 align:start position:0%
key word is solely which is what we
 
06:18:04.548 --> 06:18:04.558 align:start position:0%
talked about before which clarifies it
 
06:18:06.948 --> 06:18:06.958 align:start position:0%
because before without that key word in
 
06:18:09.030 --> 06:18:09.040 align:start position:0%
there it was very broad this narrows it
 
06:18:10.628 --> 06:18:10.638 align:start position:0%
down to something very specific which i
 
06:18:15.270 --> 06:18:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:17.830 --> 06:18:17.840 align:start position:0%
representative canuck
 
06:18:20.390 --> 06:18:20.400 align:start position:0%
yes uh just a clarification you said
 
06:18:22.150 --> 06:18:22.160 align:start position:0%
this would now place it on the
 
06:18:24.948 --> 06:18:24.958 align:start position:0%
facilities but not the provider
 
06:18:24.958 --> 06:18:26.230 align:start position:0%
facilities but not the provider
but

06:18:26.230 --> 06:18:26.240 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:18:27.430 --> 06:18:27.440 align:start position:0%
why would that
 
06:18:29.830 --> 06:18:29.840 align:start position:0%
be true i would think that if a provider
 
06:18:32.150 --> 06:18:32.160 align:start position:0%
did not want to care on the basis say a
 
06:18:33.590 --> 06:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
pediatrician said i don't take care of
 
06:18:35.110 --> 06:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
kids in my practice not vaccinated
 
06:18:37.750 --> 06:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
because of the risk to vulnerable kids
 
06:18:39.350 --> 06:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
i don't see nothing here that exempts a
 
06:18:41.670 --> 06:18:41.680 align:start position:0%
provider because it makes it blanket so
 
06:18:41.680 --> 06:18:43.030 align:start position:0%
provider because it makes it blanket so
i'm

06:18:43.030 --> 06:18:43.040 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
06:18:43.830 --> 06:18:43.840 align:start position:0%
i agree just
 
06:18:46.310 --> 06:18:46.320 align:start position:0%
it's confused
 
06:18:47.830 --> 06:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
correct the
 
06:18:49.830 --> 06:18:49.840 align:start position:0%
place this is in the statute is for
 
06:18:51.830 --> 06:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
facilities not providers
 
06:18:53.990 --> 06:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:18:55.350 --> 06:18:55.360 align:start position:0%
bye apologies
 
06:18:58.150 --> 06:18:58.160 align:start position:0%
yes and if i may clarify so it only
 
06:18:59.350 --> 06:18:59.360 align:start position:0%
applies to
 
06:19:01.910 --> 06:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
those facilities under that licensure
 
06:19:04.468 --> 06:19:04.478 align:start position:0%
paragraph so it doesn't even apply to
 
06:19:06.868 --> 06:19:06.878 align:start position:0%
primary care physicians it's really
 
06:19:06.878 --> 06:19:07.830 align:start position:0%
primary care physicians it's really
truly

06:19:07.830 --> 06:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
truly
 
06:19:09.990 --> 06:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
the larger facilities yeah we're still
 
06:19:11.750 --> 06:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
in the process of finding the statute so
 
06:19:14.070 --> 06:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
i could make sense of it thank you
 
06:19:15.750 --> 06:19:15.760 align:start position:0%
any additional questions of the
 
06:19:18.548 --> 06:19:18.558 align:start position:0%

representative lang was very keen to
 
06:23:34.310 --> 06:23:34.320 align:start position:0%
work with us
 
06:23:37.990 --> 06:23:38.000 align:start position:0%
and things eventually came down to on
 
06:23:39.830 --> 06:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
the wonderful form
 
06:23:44.788 --> 06:23:44.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:47.430 --> 06:23:47.440 align:start position:0%
the question of
 
06:23:47.440 --> 06:23:48.788 align:start position:0%
the question of

06:23:48.788 --> 06:23:48.798 align:start position:0%
should
 
06:23:51.350 --> 06:23:51.360 align:start position:0%
the document be signed
 
06:23:53.430 --> 06:23:53.440 align:start position:0%
the first time
 
06:23:56.390 --> 06:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
you go to a particular provider
 
06:23:58.628 --> 06:23:58.638 align:start position:0%
or shall it be signed
 
06:24:00.230 --> 06:24:00.240 align:start position:0%
every time
 
06:24:01.830 --> 06:24:01.840 align:start position:0%
and he says which way do you think
 
06:24:03.590 --> 06:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
they're likely to go
 
06:24:05.270 --> 06:24:05.280 align:start position:0%
and i said
 
06:24:07.910 --> 06:24:07.920 align:start position:0%
make two amendments so we're ready no
 
06:24:09.270 --> 06:24:09.280 align:start position:0%
matter what
 
06:24:12.070 --> 06:24:12.080 align:start position:0%

so you will see coming around two
amendments

06:24:13.430 --> 06:24:13.440 align:start position:0%

and the only difference
 
06:24:29.030 --> 06:24:29.040 align:start position:0%
should be
 
06:24:31.750 --> 06:24:31.760 align:start position:0%

06:37:19.030 --> 06:37:19.040 align:start position:0%
let's say the executive orders
 
06:37:21.830 --> 06:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
any of the rules that are given by any
 
06:37:23.030 --> 06:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
of the
 
06:37:25.430 --> 06:37:25.440 align:start position:0%
agencies up at the federal level
 
06:37:27.590 --> 06:37:27.600 align:start position:0%
and it basically hands over control of
 
06:37:31.590 --> 06:37:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:34.150 --> 06:37:34.160 align:start position:0%
i think we have a fantastic department
 
06:37:36.150 --> 06:37:36.160 align:start position:0%
of health and human services
 
06:37:38.230 --> 06:37:38.240 align:start position:0%
i think that they are well capable of
 
06:37:40.628 --> 06:37:40.638 align:start position:0%
helping guide new hampshire health care
 
06:37:42.310 --> 06:37:42.320 align:start position:0%
here in this state
 
06:37:44.070 --> 06:37:44.080 align:start position:0%
and i don't i think it does a disservice
 
06:37:46.390 --> 06:37:46.400 align:start position:0%
to the people of the state to hand over
 
06:37:49.270 --> 06:37:49.280 align:start position:0%
control of our hospitals to washington
 
06:37:49.280 --> 06:37:51.670 align:start position:0%
control of our hospitals to washington
d.c

06:37:51.670 --> 06:37:51.680 align:start position:0%
d.c
 
06:37:53.990 --> 06:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
by repealing this
 
06:37:56.948 --> 06:37:56.958 align:start position:0%
we avoid making the same future mistake
 
06:37:58.708 --> 06:37:58.718 align:start position:0%
of handing over control
 
06:38:00.868 --> 06:38:00.878 align:start position:0%
and leave the decision-making where it
 
06:38:03.750 --> 06:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
should be here in new hampshire
 
06:38:05.590 --> 06:38:05.600 align:start position:0%
by the time this gets through the
 
06:38:07.990 --> 06:38:08.000 align:start position:0%
coveted pandemic will be over and so it
 
06:38:10.548 --> 06:38:10.558 align:start position:0%
will technically be a mute point
 
06:38:13.190 --> 06:38:13.200 align:start position:0%
but the real problem is this sets a
 
06:38:15.910 --> 06:38:15.920 align:start position:0%
terrible precedent
 
06:38:18.230 --> 06:38:18.240 align:start position:0%
it hands over control
 
06:38:20.628 --> 06:38:20.638 align:start position:0%
we have no say-so
 
06:38:22.868 --> 06:38:22.878 align:start position:0%
and we need to get rid of this because
 
06:38:24.468 --> 06:38:24.478 align:start position:0%
it is very damaging to our health care
 
06:38:24.478 --> 06:38:25.750 align:start position:0%
it is very damaging to our health care
system

06:38:25.750 --> 06:38:25.760 align:start position:0%
system
 
06:38:27.990 --> 06:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
so with that i'm willing to take any
 
06:38:28.000 --> 06:38:29.590 align:start position:0%
so with that i'm willing to take any
questions

06:38:29.590 --> 06:38:29.600 align:start position:0%
questions
 
06:38:32.390 --> 06:38:32.400 align:start position:0%
my suggestion to the committee is you
 
06:38:35.270 --> 06:38:35.280 align:start position:0%
should have a side by side by side in
 
06:38:36.708 --> 06:38:36.718 align:start position:0%
front of you
 
06:38:38.868 --> 06:38:38.878 align:start position:0%
in any particular order
 
06:38:40.230 --> 06:38:40.240 align:start position:0%
there is
 
06:38:43.030 --> 06:38:43.040 align:start position:0%

there is representative lyons

which representative stephen pearson
 
06:39:05.270 --> 06:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
passed out so that will help you to see
 
06:39:07.990 --> 06:39:08.000 align:start position:0%

is that your question

06:39:53.670 --> 06:39:53.680 align:start position:0%

06:40:34.390 --> 06:40:34.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
06:40:36.468 --> 06:40:36.478 align:start position:0%
taking my question i'll try and switch
 
06:40:39.190 --> 06:40:39.200 align:start position:0%
back into question hearing mode rather
 
06:40:45.830 --> 06:40:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:45.840 --> 06:40:46.788 align:start position:0%
 
how

06:40:46.788 --> 06:40:46.798 align:start position:0%
how

06:40:52.160 --> 06:40:53.670 align:start position:0%
 
supposed

06:40:53.670 --> 06:40:53.680 align:start position:0%
supposed
 
06:40:58.150 --> 06:40:58.160 align:start position:0%
to square the circle with respect to
 
06:41:00.000 --> 06:41:00.010 align:start position:0%
still existing

fiscal consequences for the state

with this bill because
 
06:41:20.878 --> 06:41:23.830 align:start position:0%
with this bill because
um

06:41:23.830 --> 06:41:23.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:41:26.390 --> 06:41:26.400 align:start position:0%
although the current state of emergency
 
06:41:28.468 --> 06:41:28.478 align:start position:0%
has expired there are still orders and
 
06:41:31.110 --> 06:41:31.120 align:start position:0%
other things out there that this section
 
06:41:33.030 --> 06:41:33.040 align:start position:0%
in law
 
06:41:37.030 --> 06:41:37.040 align:start position:0%
might cover and it also there might be
 
06:41:39.670 --> 06:41:39.680 align:start position:0%
further issues coming with respect to
 
06:41:42.070 --> 06:41:42.080 align:start position:0%
covid which is the only thing i think my
 
06:41:43.750 --> 06:41:43.760 align:start position:0%
understanding is that the underlying
 
06:41:45.670 --> 06:41:45.680 align:start position:0%
statute covers
 
06:41:45.680 --> 06:41:46.788 align:start position:0%
statute covers
so

06:41:46.788 --> 06:41:46.798 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:41:53.190 --> 06:41:53.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:56.788 --> 06:41:56.798 align:start position:0%
figure out whether they are to comply
 
06:41:59.750 --> 06:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
with state mandates or
 
06:41:59.760 --> 06:42:01.030 align:start position:0%
with state mandates or
federal

06:42:01.030 --> 06:42:01.040 align:start position:0%
federal
 
06:42:02.708 --> 06:42:02.718 align:start position:0%
which require
 
06:42:06.708 --> 06:42:06.718 align:start position:0%
or federal mandates given that they may
 
06:42:08.948 --> 06:42:08.958 align:start position:0%
not be able to do both and may be at a
 
06:42:10.868 --> 06:42:10.878 align:start position:0%
significant fiscal
 
06:42:12.708 --> 06:42:12.718 align:start position:0%
disadvantage if they comply with the
 
06:42:15.030 --> 06:42:15.040 align:start position:0%
federal ones
 
06:42:16.708 --> 06:42:16.718 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
06:42:18.390 --> 06:42:18.400 align:start position:0%
the statute that
 
06:42:20.070 --> 06:42:20.080 align:start position:0%
i am looking to repeal with this
 
06:42:22.310 --> 06:42:22.320 align:start position:0%
non-germain amendment
 
06:42:23.910 --> 06:42:23.920 align:start position:0%
isn't the only reason why they might
 
06:42:25.670 --> 06:42:25.680 align:start position:0%
comply with those orders
 
06:42:27.350 --> 06:42:27.360 align:start position:0%
this does not prohibit them from
 
06:42:29.590 --> 06:42:29.600 align:start position:0%
complying with any of those and from
 
06:42:31.510 --> 06:42:31.520 align:start position:0%
applying with an executive order agency
 
06:42:33.270 --> 06:42:33.280 align:start position:0%
order rule
 
06:42:35.430 --> 06:42:35.440 align:start position:0%
it simply does not put the force of new
 
06:42:37.910 --> 06:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire law to limit liability only
 
06:42:39.990 --> 06:42:40.000 align:start position:0%
when you are following those executive
 
06:42:42.548 --> 06:42:42.558 align:start position:0%
orders agency orders or rules
 
06:42:45.430 --> 06:42:45.440 align:start position:0%
it goes silent on the issue and
 
06:42:47.430 --> 06:42:47.440 align:start position:0%
it returns to where we are with
 
06:42:49.030 --> 06:42:49.040 align:start position:0%
everything else where we go down to the
 
06:42:52.150 --> 06:42:52.160 align:start position:0%
prima facie first do no harm
 
06:42:55.350 --> 06:42:55.360 align:start position:0%
that is the way that we operate today
 
06:42:58.070 --> 06:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
that is a way to successfully operate
 
06:42:58.080 --> 06:42:58.948 align:start position:0%
that is a way to successfully operate
and

06:42:58.948 --> 06:42:58.958 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:43:01.030 --> 06:43:01.040 align:start position:0%
only giving limited liability when
 
06:43:03.110 --> 06:43:03.120 align:start position:0%
you're following executive orders agency
 
06:43:04.788 --> 06:43:04.798 align:start position:0%
orders and rules
 
06:43:08.468 --> 06:43:08.478 align:start position:0%
does a disservice to our state
 
06:43:10.788 --> 06:43:10.798 align:start position:0%
it doesn't prohibit them from complying
 
06:43:10.798 --> 06:43:14.868 align:start position:0%
it doesn't prohibit them from complying
however

06:43:14.868 --> 06:43:14.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:17.270 --> 06:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
representative canuck
 
06:43:19.110 --> 06:43:19.120 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm still just a little bit
 
06:43:22.468 --> 06:43:22.478 align:start position:0%
confused here because
 
06:43:22.478 --> 06:43:23.190 align:start position:0%
confused here because
when

06:43:23.190 --> 06:43:23.200 align:start position:0%
when
 
06:43:24.230 --> 06:43:24.240 align:start position:0%
i'm not
 
06:43:25.990 --> 06:43:26.000 align:start position:0%
since the whole point of this was to
 
06:43:28.150 --> 06:43:28.160 align:start position:0%
limit the liability because of the
 
06:43:31.510 --> 06:43:31.520 align:start position:0%
potential conflicts or even just
 
06:43:33.510 --> 06:43:33.520 align:start position:0%
for any of us who've ever been involved
 
06:43:35.270 --> 06:43:35.280 align:start position:0%
in any kind of emergency issues or think
 
06:43:37.430 --> 06:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
about how emergency triage can work for
 
06:43:37.440 --> 06:43:39.350 align:start position:0%
about how emergency triage can work for
hospitals

06:43:39.350 --> 06:43:39.360 align:start position:0%
hospitals
 
06:43:41.190 --> 06:43:41.200 align:start position:0%
the decisions are not the usual
 
06:43:42.948 --> 06:43:42.958 align:start position:0%
decisions and so i'm trying to figure
 
06:43:44.868 --> 06:43:44.878 align:start position:0%
out how you made the comment this seeds
 
06:43:47.590 --> 06:43:47.600 align:start position:0%
control and it really i don't understand
 
06:43:47.600 --> 06:43:48.548 align:start position:0%
control and it really i don't understand
how

06:43:48.548 --> 06:43:48.558 align:start position:0%
how
 
06:43:50.468 --> 06:43:50.478 align:start position:0%
they're seeding control to the state
 
06:43:51.750 --> 06:43:51.760 align:start position:0%
they still have the control of doing
 
06:43:53.430 --> 06:43:53.440 align:start position:0%
everything this is really the purpose of
 
06:43:54.788 --> 06:43:54.798 align:start position:0%
this was to absolve them from the
 
06:43:56.868 --> 06:43:56.878 align:start position:0%
liability that might come about
 
06:43:58.390 --> 06:43:58.400 align:start position:0%
because the decisions that have to be
 
06:44:00.310 --> 06:44:00.320 align:start position:0%
made that are conflicting with our
 
06:44:03.270 --> 06:44:03.280 align:start position:0%
normal decision-making process
 
06:44:04.948 --> 06:44:04.958 align:start position:0%
can you explain that more i'm still
 
06:44:04.958 --> 06:44:06.150 align:start position:0%
can you explain that more i'm still
baffled

06:44:06.150 --> 06:44:06.160 align:start position:0%
baffled
 
06:44:08.468 --> 06:44:08.478 align:start position:0%
well thank you for the question when you
 
06:44:10.230 --> 06:44:10.240 align:start position:0%
limit liabilities under certain
 
06:44:12.390 --> 06:44:12.400 align:start position:0%
conditions you're specifically not
 
06:44:14.788 --> 06:44:14.798 align:start position:0%
limiting liability under others
 
06:44:17.190 --> 06:44:17.200 align:start position:0%
by limiting liability only when you are
 
06:44:19.510 --> 06:44:19.520 align:start position:0%
complying with executive orders agency
 
06:44:21.030 --> 06:44:21.040 align:start position:0%
orders or rules
 
06:44:21.040 --> 06:44:21.910 align:start position:0%
orders or rules
that

06:44:21.910 --> 06:44:21.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:44:24.788 --> 06:44:24.798 align:start position:0%
specifically does not cover any other
 
06:44:27.190 --> 06:44:27.200 align:start position:0%
actions it remains silent just as we are
 
06:44:30.070 --> 06:44:30.080 align:start position:0%
otherwise but we heard discussion on
 
06:44:31.670 --> 06:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
some of these other bills
 
06:44:34.070 --> 06:44:34.080 align:start position:0%
that limiting the liability only to
 
06:44:36.548 --> 06:44:36.558 align:start position:0%
those following the guidelines would
 
06:44:36.558 --> 06:44:37.670 align:start position:0%
those following the guidelines would
allow

06:44:37.670 --> 06:44:37.680 align:start position:0%
allow
 
06:44:39.670 --> 06:44:39.680 align:start position:0%
punitive lawsuits to come against those
 
06:44:41.830 --> 06:44:41.840 align:start position:0%
who were not following the executive
 
06:44:43.590 --> 06:44:43.600 align:start position:0%
orders or guidelines
 
06:44:44.868 --> 06:44:44.878 align:start position:0%
so by
 
06:44:48.468 --> 06:44:48.478 align:start position:0%
passing this following that same logic
 
06:44:50.708 --> 06:44:50.718 align:start position:0%
that i there was it was not this
 
06:44:51.990 --> 06:44:52.000 align:start position:0%
committee it was a different committee
 
06:44:53.350 --> 06:44:53.360 align:start position:0%
there were three different bills three
 
06:44:56.390 --> 06:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
different committees
 
06:44:59.590 --> 06:44:59.600 align:start position:0%
it show it would then follow
 
06:45:02.310 --> 06:45:02.320 align:start position:0%
that if you're not doing that it is open
 
06:45:04.310 --> 06:45:04.320 align:start position:0%
season on the hospitals file your
 
06:45:07.910 --> 06:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
lawsuit and let's see what we can do
 
06:45:10.788 --> 06:45:10.798 align:start position:0%
remaining silent is more protective
 
06:45:13.190 --> 06:45:13.200 align:start position:0%
can i have a follow-up follow-up
 
06:45:15.190 --> 06:45:15.200 align:start position:0%
i'm not quite sure why it would be open
 
06:45:17.670 --> 06:45:17.680 align:start position:0%
season anymore than it already is
 
06:45:19.910 --> 06:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
number one number two is what do you
 
06:45:22.708 --> 06:45:22.718 align:start position:0%
think might be the impact on
 
06:45:25.350 --> 06:45:25.360 align:start position:0%
getting group providers to happily
 
06:45:28.310 --> 06:45:28.320 align:start position:0%
provide care in an emergency
 
06:45:31.910 --> 06:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
uh that in particularly those who were
 
06:45:34.230 --> 06:45:34.240 align:start position:0%
working outside of their usual purview
 
06:45:36.788 --> 06:45:36.798 align:start position:0%
because they really had to do you
 
06:45:38.868 --> 06:45:38.878 align:start position:0%
foresee any potential problems that
 
06:45:41.110 --> 06:45:41.120 align:start position:0%
might come from trying to
 
06:45:41.120 --> 06:45:42.788 align:start position:0%
might come from trying to
recruit

06:45:42.788 --> 06:45:42.798 align:start position:0%
recruit
 
06:45:44.548 --> 06:45:44.558 align:start position:0%
providers to actually
 
06:45:44.558 --> 06:45:45.590 align:start position:0%
providers to actually
care

06:45:45.590 --> 06:45:45.600 align:start position:0%
care
 
06:45:47.030 --> 06:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
if they are no longer shielded from
 
06:45:47.040 --> 06:45:48.788 align:start position:0%
if they are no longer shielded from
liability

06:45:48.788 --> 06:45:48.798 align:start position:0%
liability
 
06:45:50.548 --> 06:45:50.558 align:start position:0%
well thank you for the question there
 
06:45:52.230 --> 06:45:52.240 align:start position:0%
are some states that are pursuing this
 
06:45:53.670 --> 06:45:53.680 align:start position:0%
route others that are resisting it
 
06:45:53.680 --> 06:45:54.948 align:start position:0%
route others that are resisting it
strongly

06:45:54.948 --> 06:45:54.958 align:start position:0%
strongly
 
06:45:56.948 --> 06:45:56.958 align:start position:0%
right now when you're operating in an
 
06:45:58.628 --> 06:45:58.638 align:start position:0%
emergency there's there's certain
 
06:45:58.638 --> 06:46:00.830 align:start position:0%
emergency there's there's certain
expectations

06:46:00.830 --> 06:46:00.840 align:start position:0%
expectations
 
06:46:03.510 --> 06:46:03.520 align:start position:0%
but normally you would look at your
 
06:46:05.670 --> 06:46:05.680 align:start position:0%
patient look at your opportunities and
 
06:46:07.270 --> 06:46:07.280 align:start position:0%
you would work within the toolkit that
 
06:46:08.468 --> 06:46:08.478 align:start position:0%
you have
 
06:46:10.708 --> 06:46:10.718 align:start position:0%
this limits the toolkit to those within
 
06:46:12.868 --> 06:46:12.878 align:start position:0%
the emergency orders and agency orders
 
06:46:16.868 --> 06:46:16.878 align:start position:0%
and rules to have protection
 
06:46:19.350 --> 06:46:19.360 align:start position:0%
by specifically protecting some actions
 
06:46:23.270 --> 06:46:23.280 align:start position:0%
and not others that sets up a scenario
 
06:46:25.750 --> 06:46:25.760 align:start position:0%
where some things are viewed favorably
 
06:46:28.830 --> 06:46:28.840 align:start position:0%
under the law and others are
 
06:46:34.708 --> 06:46:34.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:36.628 --> 06:46:36.638 align:start position:0%
thank you that sets me off on another
 
06:46:40.150 --> 06:46:40.160 align:start position:0%
line of inquiry if i remember correctly
 
06:46:42.030 --> 06:46:42.040 align:start position:0%
one of the
 
06:46:44.708 --> 06:46:44.718 align:start position:0%
concerns and i'm not a fan of limited
 
06:46:46.948 --> 06:46:46.958 align:start position:0%
liability myself
 
06:46:49.590 --> 06:46:49.600 align:start position:0%
one of the concerns that
 
06:46:52.708 --> 06:46:52.718 align:start position:0%
persuaded us to pass this just a year
 
06:46:52.718 --> 06:46:54.070 align:start position:0%
persuaded us to pass this just a year
ago

06:46:54.070 --> 06:46:54.080 align:start position:0%
ago
 
06:46:56.468 --> 06:46:56.478 align:start position:0%
was that at the height of an emergency
 
06:47:02.230 --> 06:47:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:05.350 --> 06:47:05.360 align:start position:0%
health care providers and facilities
 
06:47:08.070 --> 06:47:08.080 align:start position:0%
were sometimes required
 
06:47:10.788 --> 06:47:10.798 align:start position:0%
to act in ways that were not in
 
06:47:10.798 --> 06:47:12.310 align:start position:0%
to act in ways that were not in
accordance

06:47:12.310 --> 06:47:12.320 align:start position:0%
accordance
 
06:47:16.070 --> 06:47:16.080 align:start position:0%
with generally accepted practice
 
06:47:16.080 --> 06:47:16.948 align:start position:0%
with generally accepted practice
so

06:47:16.948 --> 06:47:16.958 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:47:19.270 --> 06:47:19.280 align:start position:0%
i don't know what the specific examples
 
06:47:21.110 --> 06:47:21.120 align:start position:0%
are and there are people behind you that
 
06:47:22.788 --> 06:47:22.798 align:start position:0%
can probably provide them but i'm
 
06:47:25.990 --> 06:47:26.000 align:start position:0%
thinking that you know leaving a number
 
06:47:28.390 --> 06:47:28.400 align:start position:0%
of critically ill patients out in the
 
06:47:30.788 --> 06:47:30.798 align:start position:0%
hallway on gurneys because
 
06:47:33.270 --> 06:47:33.280 align:start position:0%
it is not a good thing but if you don't
 
06:47:35.990 --> 06:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
have any other place to put them it may
 
06:47:38.468 --> 06:47:38.478 align:start position:0%
be something that you have to deal with
 
06:47:38.478 --> 06:47:39.590 align:start position:0%
be something that you have to deal with
so

06:47:39.590 --> 06:47:39.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:47:39.600 --> 06:47:41.510 align:start position:0%
so
i'm

06:47:41.510 --> 06:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
06:47:41.520 --> 06:47:44.708 align:start position:0%
i'm
wondering

06:47:44.708 --> 06:47:44.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:50.788 --> 06:47:50.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:52.628 --> 06:47:52.638 align:start position:0%
there was
 
06:47:54.708 --> 06:47:54.718 align:start position:0%
a concern
 
06:47:58.948 --> 06:47:58.958 align:start position:0%
specific to the pandemic and to practice
 
06:48:02.548 --> 06:48:02.558 align:start position:0%
during a pandemic under emergency orders
 
06:48:04.628 --> 06:48:04.638 align:start position:0%
that was very different
 
06:48:06.830 --> 06:48:06.840 align:start position:0%
from all normal
 
06:48:10.150 --> 06:48:10.160 align:start position:0%
practice and that would be why under
 
06:48:12.468 --> 06:48:12.478 align:start position:0%
those circumstances
 
06:48:14.708 --> 06:48:14.718 align:start position:0%
you would limit liability
 
06:48:17.910 --> 06:48:17.920 align:start position:0%
solely for people who were departing
 
06:48:19.990 --> 06:48:20.000 align:start position:0%
from their standard practice because
 
06:48:22.948 --> 06:48:22.958 align:start position:0%
they were ordered to do so and that that
 
06:48:26.070 --> 06:48:26.080 align:start position:0%
provides the differentiation between the
 
06:48:28.310 --> 06:48:28.320 align:start position:0%
limitation of liability
 
06:48:30.628 --> 06:48:30.638 align:start position:0%
under these circumstances and not under
 
06:48:34.468 --> 06:48:34.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:36.390 --> 06:48:36.400 align:start position:0%
i think i'll make a question out of that
 
06:48:38.390 --> 06:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
um when you look to that and look to the
 
06:48:40.628 --> 06:48:40.638 align:start position:0%
patients on the gurneys
 
06:48:44.070 --> 06:48:44.080 align:start position:0%
out in the hallways that was not done
 
06:48:47.110 --> 06:48:47.120 align:start position:0%
as an executive order or an agency rule
 
06:48:48.868 --> 06:48:48.878 align:start position:0%
it was a consequence but there were a
 
06:48:50.548 --> 06:48:50.558 align:start position:0%
lot of those consequences
 
06:48:52.548 --> 06:48:52.558 align:start position:0%
and all of those actions
 
06:48:54.868 --> 06:48:54.878 align:start position:0%
we do need to understand
 
06:48:57.510 --> 06:48:57.520 align:start position:0%
are part of dealing with a triage
 
06:48:59.910 --> 06:48:59.920 align:start position:0%
situation even when that triage lasts
 
06:49:02.708 --> 06:49:02.718 align:start position:0%
for months or over a year
 
06:49:05.510 --> 06:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
the an approach that recognizes that
 
06:49:07.030 --> 06:49:07.040 align:start position:0%
doctors who are
 
06:49:08.948 --> 06:49:08.958 align:start position:0%
putting patients
 
06:49:12.150 --> 06:49:12.160 align:start position:0%
health autonomy and balancing the scarce
 
06:49:12.160 --> 06:49:13.510 align:start position:0%
health autonomy and balancing the scarce
resources

06:49:13.510 --> 06:49:13.520 align:start position:0%
resources
 
06:49:15.990 --> 06:49:16.000 align:start position:0%
when we are in an emergency situation
 
06:49:19.030 --> 06:49:19.040 align:start position:0%
would be one thing but this is waiting
 
06:49:22.150 --> 06:49:22.160 align:start position:0%
for orders to come either from executive
 
06:49:25.110 --> 06:49:25.120 align:start position:0%
orders emergency orders executive orders
 
06:49:27.670 --> 06:49:27.680 align:start position:0%
or agencies and that takes time
 
06:49:29.910 --> 06:49:29.920 align:start position:0%
the biggest time when our physicians and
 
06:49:31.670 --> 06:49:31.680 align:start position:0%
doctors and all of our other health care
 
06:49:34.150 --> 06:49:34.160 align:start position:0%
protect professionals need protection
 
06:49:35.590 --> 06:49:35.600 align:start position:0%
isn't once we start having some
 
06:49:37.750 --> 06:49:37.760 align:start position:0%
guidelines of how things happen
 
06:49:39.510 --> 06:49:39.520 align:start position:0%
it's while they're trying to do their
 
06:49:41.990 --> 06:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
best to meet an emerging need
 
06:49:44.390 --> 06:49:44.400 align:start position:0%
this is
 
06:49:47.190 --> 06:49:47.200 align:start position:0%
i i i believe that this
 
06:49:48.948 --> 06:49:48.958 align:start position:0%
was overreach and it only protects those
 
06:49:50.230 --> 06:49:50.240 align:start position:0%
things that are under the executive
 
06:49:51.830 --> 06:49:51.840 align:start position:0%
order and i do remember when we were
 
06:49:54.468 --> 06:49:54.478 align:start position:0%
discussing senate bill 74 last year
 
06:49:56.150 --> 06:49:56.160 align:start position:0%
talking about the need to be able to
 
06:49:58.948 --> 06:49:58.958 align:start position:0%
access experimental therapies that was
 
06:50:00.868 --> 06:50:00.878 align:start position:0%
one of the things that i was able to
 
06:50:03.590 --> 06:50:03.600 align:start position:0%
work with with some of you in in moving
 
06:50:06.548 --> 06:50:06.558 align:start position:0%
that forward and we recognized that
 
06:50:09.910 --> 06:50:09.920 align:start position:0%
there needs to be a larger tool kit
 
06:50:12.070 --> 06:50:12.080 align:start position:0%
but that tool kit
 
06:50:14.708 --> 06:50:14.718 align:start position:0%
allowing emergent allowing experimental
 
06:50:14.718 --> 06:50:15.590 align:start position:0%
allowing emergent allowing experimental
use

06:50:15.590 --> 06:50:15.600 align:start position:0%
use
 
06:50:18.070 --> 06:50:18.080 align:start position:0%
that that hasn't been fully adopted
 
06:50:20.150 --> 06:50:20.160 align:start position:0%
within within our attempt to deal with
 
06:50:21.990 --> 06:50:22.000 align:start position:0%
this pandemic
 
06:50:23.830 --> 06:50:23.840 align:start position:0%
so i think that the protections we would
 
06:50:26.948 --> 06:50:26.958 align:start position:0%
need would need to be softer and broader
 
06:50:29.430 --> 06:50:29.440 align:start position:0%
and not so laser focused where it's only
 
06:50:31.670 --> 06:50:31.680 align:start position:0%
protecting emergency executive orders
 
06:50:35.830 --> 06:50:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:39.990 --> 06:50:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:41.910 --> 06:50:41.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
 
06:50:43.670 --> 06:50:43.680 align:start position:0%
representative taking my question
 
06:50:47.270 --> 06:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at the last line in the rsa
 
06:50:50.390 --> 06:50:50.400 align:start position:0%
21p 42a
 
06:50:52.548 --> 06:50:52.558 align:start position:0%
this section shall not apply to actions
 
06:50:54.548 --> 06:50:54.558 align:start position:0%
performed after such an emergency order
 
06:50:57.350 --> 06:50:57.360 align:start position:0%
a rule is no longer in effect do we have
 
06:51:00.390 --> 06:51:00.400 align:start position:0%
an emergency order in effect
 
06:51:02.390 --> 06:51:02.400 align:start position:0%
no we do not so therefore isn't the bill
 
06:51:03.910 --> 06:51:03.920 align:start position:0%
null and void
 
06:51:06.070 --> 06:51:06.080 align:start position:0%
the statute itself
 
06:51:07.590 --> 06:51:07.600 align:start position:0%
i would argue that that's a good reason
 
06:51:09.350 --> 06:51:09.360 align:start position:0%
to repeal it
 
06:51:11.670 --> 06:51:11.680 align:start position:0%
isn't it already repealed
 
06:51:13.750 --> 06:51:13.760 align:start position:0%
i mean not not repealed from us but
 
06:51:15.190 --> 06:51:15.200 align:start position:0%
repealed because of the way the statute
 
06:51:16.150 --> 06:51:16.160 align:start position:0%
is written
 
06:51:20.628 --> 06:51:20.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:22.628 --> 06:51:22.638 align:start position:0%
um if they're
 
06:51:24.868 --> 06:51:24.878 align:start position:0%
no because if there's a resurgence if or
 
06:51:26.150 --> 06:51:26.160 align:start position:0%
for some other reason we have an
 
06:51:28.390 --> 06:51:28.400 align:start position:0%
emergency order or rule that enables it
 
06:51:30.390 --> 06:51:30.400 align:start position:0%
it would come back into play but it's
 
06:51:31.510 --> 06:51:31.520 align:start position:0%
only if it's
 
06:51:33.910 --> 06:51:33.920 align:start position:0%
for coronavirus yes
 
06:51:36.070 --> 06:51:36.080 align:start position:0%
it's the only thing it applies to
 
06:51:36.080 --> 06:51:38.948 align:start position:0%
it's the only thing it applies to
yes

06:51:38.948 --> 06:51:38.958 align:start position:0%
yes
 
06:51:41.350 --> 06:51:41.360 align:start position:0%
not to general emergencies
 
06:51:42.948 --> 06:51:42.958 align:start position:0%
globally speaking
 
06:51:44.788 --> 06:51:44.798 align:start position:0%
no it doesn't and i think that coming
 
06:51:46.150 --> 06:51:46.160 align:start position:0%
forward in the fall was something that
 
06:51:46.160 --> 06:51:47.110 align:start position:0%
forward in the fall was something that
better

06:51:47.110 --> 06:51:47.120 align:start position:0%
better
 
06:51:48.788 --> 06:51:48.798 align:start position:0%
allows physicians to practice as best
 
06:51:50.868 --> 06:51:50.878 align:start position:0%
they can under an emergency would be a
 
06:51:54.628 --> 06:51:54.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:03.670 --> 06:52:03.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:04.708 --> 06:52:04.718 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:52:06.548 --> 06:52:06.558 align:start position:0%
i have a concern that even though the
 
06:52:09.350 --> 06:52:09.360 align:start position:0%
emergency is over at this point
 
06:52:11.110 --> 06:52:11.120 align:start position:0%
the worth some consequences that may
 
06:52:12.548 --> 06:52:12.558 align:start position:0%
have come out of the fact for example
 
06:52:13.990 --> 06:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
many hospitals
 
06:52:16.628 --> 06:52:16.638 align:start position:0%
stopped doing all elective surgeries and
 
06:52:18.468 --> 06:52:18.478 align:start position:0%
each patients that was supposed to be
 
06:52:20.070 --> 06:52:20.080 align:start position:0%
scheduled for surgery and didn't get the
 
06:52:20.080 --> 06:52:21.270 align:start position:0%
scheduled for surgery and didn't get the
surgery

06:52:21.270 --> 06:52:21.280 align:start position:0%
surgery
 
06:52:22.548 --> 06:52:22.558 align:start position:0%
they could have some continuing
 
06:52:24.788 --> 06:52:24.798 align:start position:0%
liability as a result of that
 
06:52:27.750 --> 06:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
you know we had other situations where
 
06:52:29.750 --> 06:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
field hospital tents had to be set up in
 
06:52:32.230 --> 06:52:32.240 align:start position:0%
parking lots and patient beds were put
 
06:52:34.070 --> 06:52:34.080 align:start position:0%
in that's very unusual set of
 
06:52:36.468 --> 06:52:36.478 align:start position:0%
circumstances which could have had after
 
06:52:38.788 --> 06:52:38.798 align:start position:0%
effects that even follows after the bill
 
06:52:40.468 --> 06:52:40.478 align:start position:0%
is repealed
 
06:52:40.478 --> 06:52:41.350 align:start position:0%
is repealed
and

06:52:41.350 --> 06:52:41.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:52:44.150 --> 06:52:44.160 align:start position:0%
i think by specifically naming what some
 
06:52:45.830 --> 06:52:45.840 align:start position:0%
of the protections against that
 
06:52:48.230 --> 06:52:48.240 align:start position:0%
liability in during the period of
 
06:52:50.548 --> 06:52:50.558 align:start position:0%
emergency and the wording seemed to
 
06:52:52.948 --> 06:52:52.958 align:start position:0%
imply that any of the consequences that
 
06:52:55.270 --> 06:52:55.280 align:start position:0%
occurred afterwards even after that
 
06:52:55.280 --> 06:52:56.868 align:start position:0%
occurred afterwards even after that
emergency

06:52:56.868 --> 06:52:56.878 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
06:52:58.468 --> 06:52:58.478 align:start position:0%
bill was
 
06:53:03.030 --> 06:53:03.040 align:start position:0%
repealed or ended however it stopped
 
06:53:04.468 --> 06:53:04.478 align:start position:0%
it would still be but under the
 
06:53:06.708 --> 06:53:06.718 align:start position:0%
circumstances i don't know about what
 
06:53:08.070 --> 06:53:08.080 align:start position:0%
even though there was some protection
 
06:53:09.830 --> 06:53:09.840 align:start position:0%
while it was going on
 
06:53:11.510 --> 06:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
that the way it's worded now or the way
 
06:53:13.270 --> 06:53:13.280 align:start position:0%
you're suggesting that it would that was
 
06:53:15.110 --> 06:53:15.120 align:start position:0%
continue to be for the like the elective
 
06:53:16.788 --> 06:53:16.798 align:start position:0%
surgery or people that were treated in
 
06:53:16.798 --> 06:53:17.830 align:start position:0%
surgery or people that were treated in
rather

06:53:17.830 --> 06:53:17.840 align:start position:0%
rather
 
06:53:19.990 --> 06:53:20.000 align:start position:0%
strange way and the other was that
 
06:53:22.548 --> 06:53:22.558 align:start position:0%
for example during a good portion of
 
06:53:24.628 --> 06:53:24.638 align:start position:0%
that whole emergency
 
06:53:26.310 --> 06:53:26.320 align:start position:0%
hospitals complained that they could not
 
06:53:27.910 --> 06:53:27.920 align:start position:0%
get the protective equipment that they
 
06:53:27.920 --> 06:53:29.190 align:start position:0%
get the protective equipment that they
needed

06:53:29.190 --> 06:53:29.200 align:start position:0%
needed
 
06:53:30.788 --> 06:53:30.798 align:start position:0%
representative snow wrap up your
 
06:53:33.830 --> 06:53:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:35.910 --> 06:53:35.920 align:start position:0%
statement that's an explanation yes i'm
 
06:53:38.230 --> 06:53:38.240 align:start position:0%
sorry my question is
 
06:53:39.670 --> 06:53:39.680 align:start position:0%
are there
 
06:53:42.070 --> 06:53:42.080 align:start position:0%
possible consequences
 
06:53:44.070 --> 06:53:44.080 align:start position:0%
to leaving it the way it is and not
 
06:53:46.628 --> 06:53:46.638 align:start position:0%
leaving the exceptions in
 
06:53:48.708 --> 06:53:48.718 align:start position:0%
that were written in the bill when the
 
06:53:50.708 --> 06:53:50.718 align:start position:0%
emergency was going on and even to
 
06:53:53.350 --> 06:53:53.360 align:start position:0%
follow up to it wouldn't that be a safer
 
06:53:55.190 --> 06:53:55.200 align:start position:0%
route to take
 
06:53:56.468 --> 06:53:56.478 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question and that
 
06:53:58.390 --> 06:53:58.400 align:start position:0%
does bring up a very good point and i
 
06:54:00.150 --> 06:54:00.160 align:start position:0%
think it it's exactly why we have
 
06:54:02.468 --> 06:54:02.478 align:start position:0%
hearings on non-german amendments
 
06:54:05.030 --> 06:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
i think the idea
 
06:54:07.190 --> 06:54:07.200 align:start position:0%
of terminating that and not allowing it
 
06:54:08.788 --> 06:54:08.798 align:start position:0%
to move forward
 
06:54:11.190 --> 06:54:11.200 align:start position:0%
but maintaining that protection for our
 
06:54:13.110 --> 06:54:13.120 align:start position:0%
facilities that were operating
 
06:54:15.830 --> 06:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
underneath this limited liability shield
 
06:54:17.670 --> 06:54:17.680 align:start position:0%
makes sense because the way that they
 
06:54:19.510 --> 06:54:19.520 align:start position:0%
operated at that time was based upon
 
06:54:22.310 --> 06:54:22.320 align:start position:0%
this limited liability i we can't strip
 
06:54:24.868 --> 06:54:24.878 align:start position:0%
that out from them now and recognizing
 
06:54:26.788 --> 06:54:26.798 align:start position:0%
that it existed and that's how they
 
06:54:29.350 --> 06:54:29.360 align:start position:0%
functioned seems reasonable to me
 
06:54:30.310 --> 06:54:30.320 align:start position:0%
but i
 
06:54:33.510 --> 06:54:33.520 align:start position:0%
i don't believe that giving the force of
 
06:54:35.910 --> 06:54:35.920 align:start position:0%
law to the executive orders and agency
 
06:54:37.830 --> 06:54:37.840 align:start position:0%
orders is the right way to move forward
 
06:54:40.390 --> 06:54:40.400 align:start position:0%
so i would like to see this
 
06:54:41.750 --> 06:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
i would like to make sure that in
 
06:54:44.310 --> 06:54:44.320 align:start position:0%
another emergency order or rule it
 
06:54:46.468 --> 06:54:46.478 align:start position:0%
cannot be brought back
 
06:54:49.030 --> 06:54:49.040 align:start position:0%
but i'm happy to continue to extend that
 
06:54:51.430 --> 06:54:51.440 align:start position:0%
protection for whatever the lawsuit
 
06:54:53.590 --> 06:54:53.600 align:start position:0%
duration would be for anybody who was
 
06:54:57.830 --> 06:54:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:00.390 --> 06:55:00.400 align:start position:0%
representative canuck
 
06:55:03.430 --> 06:55:03.440 align:start position:0%
okay i'm still a little baffled um
 
06:55:06.628 --> 06:55:06.638 align:start position:0%
you keep contending that this set some
 
06:55:08.948 --> 06:55:08.958 align:start position:0%
kind of a differential protection
 
06:55:10.310 --> 06:55:10.320 align:start position:0%
and that
 
06:55:12.230 --> 06:55:12.240 align:start position:0%
those any actions then that are not
 
06:55:14.628 --> 06:55:14.638 align:start position:0%
under the emergency would would somehow
 
06:55:15.670 --> 06:55:15.680 align:start position:0%
almost be
 
06:55:17.910 --> 06:55:17.920 align:start position:0%
have an increased liability but since
 
06:55:19.670 --> 06:55:19.680 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in the original statute
 
06:55:22.230 --> 06:55:22.240 align:start position:0%
that says that any actions taken that
 
06:55:23.990 --> 06:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
don't comply that are sort of applied
 
06:55:27.030 --> 06:55:27.040 align:start position:0%
but sorry that are not related to this
 
06:55:29.510 --> 06:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
are uniquely
 
06:55:31.910 --> 06:55:31.920 align:start position:0%
liable or
 
06:55:33.750 --> 06:55:33.760 align:start position:0%
exposed to liability
 
06:55:35.670 --> 06:55:35.680 align:start position:0%
the same liability that would always be
 
06:55:38.468 --> 06:55:38.478 align:start position:0%
there for any other care that we give is
 
06:55:39.910 --> 06:55:39.920 align:start position:0%
already there
 
06:55:41.510 --> 06:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
all this does is extend it for the
 
06:55:43.670 --> 06:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
unique circumstance the underlying not
 
06:55:45.990 --> 06:55:46.000 align:start position:0%
your bill but the underlying extent that
 
06:55:47.670 --> 06:55:47.680 align:start position:0%
only for that unique circumstance and
 
06:55:49.270 --> 06:55:49.280 align:start position:0%
did not
 
06:55:51.670 --> 06:55:51.680 align:start position:0%
increase the liability for things that
 
06:55:53.110 --> 06:55:53.120 align:start position:0%
were not under the emergency order so
 
06:55:54.868 --> 06:55:54.878 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to understand still
 
06:55:56.628 --> 06:55:56.638 align:start position:0%
why you keep making that comment about
 
06:55:58.628 --> 06:55:58.638 align:start position:0%
it being differential as though
 
06:56:00.390 --> 06:56:00.400 align:start position:0%
we're at an increased liability if we
 
06:56:01.910 --> 06:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
haven't if we're doing something that
 
06:56:03.270 --> 06:56:03.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to do with the emergency
 
06:56:05.190 --> 06:56:05.200 align:start position:0%
order anymore than we already would be
 
06:56:08.390 --> 06:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
facing a normal practice
 
06:56:11.270 --> 06:56:11.280 align:start position:0%
well thank you for that question in
 
06:56:12.948 --> 06:56:12.958 align:start position:0%
in another committee in a hearing for a
 
06:56:16.468 --> 06:56:16.478 align:start position:0%
very similar bill it was explained
 
06:56:18.390 --> 06:56:18.400 align:start position:0%
by people with better legal minds than
 
06:56:18.400 --> 06:56:19.430 align:start position:0%
by people with better legal minds than
mine

06:56:19.430 --> 06:56:19.440 align:start position:0%
mine
 
06:56:21.190 --> 06:56:21.200 align:start position:0%
why that mattered
 
06:56:22.708 --> 06:56:22.718 align:start position:0%
if we are past
 
06:56:24.548 --> 06:56:24.558 align:start position:0%
this emergency
 
06:56:27.910 --> 06:56:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:56:30.070 --> 06:56:30.080 align:start position:0%
if we're past this we're past this let's
 
06:56:31.910 --> 06:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
put this in the past let's figure out
 
06:56:33.030 --> 06:56:33.040 align:start position:0%
how to make sure that we have full
 
06:56:35.510 --> 06:56:35.520 align:start position:0%
protection because if the liability is
 
06:56:38.230 --> 06:56:38.240 align:start position:0%
only limited under those orders and
 
06:56:40.948 --> 06:56:40.958 align:start position:0%
rules then that has a larger reason to
 
06:56:42.628 --> 06:56:42.638 align:start position:0%
have more and more of these orders and
 
06:56:44.868 --> 06:56:44.878 align:start position:0%
rules next time around
 
06:56:47.030 --> 06:56:47.040 align:start position:0%
it's just it's not good law making to
 
06:56:48.948 --> 06:56:48.958 align:start position:0%
just hand everything over to a different
 
06:56:48.958 --> 06:56:49.990 align:start position:0%
just hand everything over to a different
body

06:56:49.990 --> 06:56:50.000 align:start position:0%
body
 
06:56:52.708 --> 06:56:52.718 align:start position:0%
we have local control here we take great
 
06:56:54.310 --> 06:56:54.320 align:start position:0%
pride in our health and human services
 
06:56:56.070 --> 06:56:56.080 align:start position:0%
department and i believe that we can
 
06:57:00.548 --> 06:57:00.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:00.558 --> 06:57:01.910 align:start position:0%
 
and

06:57:01.910 --> 06:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:57:03.830 --> 06:57:03.840 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
06:57:05.030 --> 06:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
now i'm getting more confused because
 
06:57:06.150 --> 06:57:06.160 align:start position:0%
you talked about
 
06:57:08.390 --> 06:57:08.400 align:start position:0%
under good hands with our department but
 
06:57:09.670 --> 06:57:09.680 align:start position:0%
our department is
 
06:57:11.110 --> 06:57:11.120 align:start position:0%
these executive orders didn't just come
 
06:57:12.390 --> 06:57:12.400 align:start position:0%
out of the air from the governor they
 
06:57:14.708 --> 06:57:14.718 align:start position:0%
were in consultation with dhhs were they
 
06:57:14.718 --> 06:57:16.150 align:start position:0%
were in consultation with dhhs were they
not

06:57:16.150 --> 06:57:16.160 align:start position:0%
not
 
06:57:18.310 --> 06:57:18.320 align:start position:0%
this speaks to orders coming from the
 
06:57:22.150 --> 06:57:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:22.160 --> 06:57:23.510 align:start position:0%
 
i

06:57:23.510 --> 06:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
i
 
06:57:25.670 --> 06:57:25.680 align:start position:0%
follow up i'm sorry
 
06:57:25.680 --> 06:57:27.510 align:start position:0%
follow up i'm sorry
no

06:57:27.510 --> 06:57:27.520 align:start position:0%
no
 
06:57:29.430 --> 06:57:29.440 align:start position:0%
uh just to let you know where i'm i'm
 
06:57:31.350 --> 06:57:31.360 align:start position:0%
going um
 
06:57:33.830 --> 06:57:33.840 align:start position:0%
this is on one of the two amendments
 
06:57:35.110 --> 06:57:35.120 align:start position:0%
before us
 
06:57:38.868 --> 06:57:38.878 align:start position:0%
we have somebody from cmc dash
 
06:57:41.110 --> 06:57:41.120 align:start position:0%
i think it's nhha which is new hampshire
 
06:57:43.110 --> 06:57:43.120 align:start position:0%
hospital association
 
06:57:43.120 --> 06:57:44.070 align:start position:0%
hospital association
that

06:57:44.070 --> 06:57:44.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:57:47.110 --> 06:57:47.120 align:start position:0%
is wishing to speak to this specific
 
06:57:47.120 --> 06:57:48.628 align:start position:0%
is wishing to speak to this specific
amendment

06:57:48.628 --> 06:57:48.638 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
06:57:50.948 --> 06:57:50.958 align:start position:0%
so if there were no further questions of
 
06:57:53.030 --> 06:57:53.040 align:start position:0%
representative leon
 
06:57:55.110 --> 06:57:55.120 align:start position:0%
other than representative cushman's
 
06:57:58.070 --> 06:57:58.080 align:start position:0%
question i'm going to then call on jason
 
06:58:01.830 --> 06:58:01.840 align:start position:0%
cole we will deal with 7 27 by
 
06:58:05.030 --> 06:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
conversation then we will ask uh
 
06:58:07.110 --> 06:58:07.120 align:start position:0%
representative contoir to come up and
 
06:58:08.948 --> 06:58:08.958 align:start position:0%
explain her amendments so we're keeping
 
06:58:12.230 --> 06:58:12.240 align:start position:0%
them in our minds in discrete lanes
 
06:58:14.708 --> 06:58:14.718 align:start position:0%
representative cushman thank you mr
 
06:58:14.718 --> 06:58:15.830 align:start position:0%
representative cushman thank you mr
chairman

06:58:15.830 --> 06:58:15.840 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
06:58:17.590 --> 06:58:17.600 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative for taking
 
06:58:19.590 --> 06:58:19.600 align:start position:0%
my question so
 
06:58:22.070 --> 06:58:22.080 align:start position:0%
um while it is true that the covet 19
 
06:58:24.468 --> 06:58:24.478 align:start position:0%
pandemic presented challenges in health
 
06:58:26.468 --> 06:58:26.478 align:start position:0%
care that required flexibility and
 
06:58:29.030 --> 06:58:29.040 align:start position:0%
deviations from standard practice
 
06:58:31.270 --> 06:58:31.280 align:start position:0%
isn't it true that if any harm occurred
 
06:58:33.030 --> 06:58:33.040 align:start position:0%
for which families and patients seek
 
06:58:34.788 --> 06:58:34.798 align:start position:0%
justice that
 
06:58:37.190 --> 06:58:37.200 align:start position:0%
civil liability for such harm should be
 
06:58:39.750 --> 06:58:39.760 align:start position:0%
decided on on a case-by-case basis in a
 
06:58:41.430 --> 06:58:41.440 align:start position:0%
court of law
 
06:58:43.430 --> 06:58:43.440 align:start position:0%
and and
 
06:58:46.070 --> 06:58:46.080 align:start position:0%
a second part of my question is
 
06:58:48.230 --> 06:58:48.240 align:start position:0%
are you aware that malpractice and
 
06:58:50.070 --> 06:58:50.080 align:start position:0%
negligence claims hinge on what a
 
06:58:51.510 --> 06:58:51.520 align:start position:0%
reasonably competent medical
 
06:58:52.948 --> 06:58:52.958 align:start position:0%
professional would do in the same
 
06:58:52.958 --> 06:58:55.750 align:start position:0%
professional would do in the same
circumstances

06:58:55.750 --> 06:58:55.760 align:start position:0%
circumstances
 
06:58:58.310 --> 06:58:58.320 align:start position:0%
thank you yes i do believe that it would
 
06:59:01.430 --> 06:59:01.440 align:start position:0%
be hard-pressed to find somebody who
 
06:59:04.548 --> 06:59:04.558 align:start position:0%
would give a civil judgment against
 
06:59:06.468 --> 06:59:06.478 align:start position:0%
somebody who is operating
 
06:59:08.390 --> 06:59:08.400 align:start position:0%
under these orders
 
06:59:10.468 --> 06:59:10.478 align:start position:0%
i don't think that any reasonable judge
 
06:59:12.468 --> 06:59:12.478 align:start position:0%
or any reasonable jury if it was a jury
 
06:59:15.350 --> 06:59:15.360 align:start position:0%
trial would convict assuming that there
 
06:59:17.350 --> 06:59:17.360 align:start position:0%
weren't egregious errors
 
06:59:19.670 --> 06:59:19.680 align:start position:0%
this is something where we deal with
 
06:59:20.948 --> 06:59:20.958 align:start position:0%
we deal with the fact that we have a
 
06:59:23.830 --> 06:59:23.840 align:start position:0%
good judicial system and and yes i do
 
06:59:25.350 --> 06:59:25.360 align:start position:0%
believe that um
 
06:59:27.030 --> 06:59:27.040 align:start position:0%
my understanding of the malpractice
 
06:59:29.430 --> 06:59:29.440 align:start position:0%
insurance is that as well that it's what
 
06:59:31.110 --> 06:59:31.120 align:start position:0%
a reasonable person would do one
 
06:59:31.120 --> 06:59:32.390 align:start position:0%
a reasonable person would do one
follow-up

06:59:32.390 --> 06:59:32.400 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
06:59:35.430 --> 06:59:35.440 align:start position:0%
one follow-up thank you mr chairman
 
06:59:37.990 --> 06:59:38.000 align:start position:0%
uh follow-up
 
06:59:40.150 --> 06:59:40.160 align:start position:0%
would you agree that giving blanket
 
06:59:42.628 --> 06:59:42.638 align:start position:0%
liability immunity from harm
 
06:59:44.788 --> 06:59:44.798 align:start position:0%
can cause a result
 
06:59:44.798 --> 06:59:45.708 align:start position:0%
can cause a result
of

06:59:45.708 --> 06:59:45.718 align:start position:0%
of
 
06:59:47.670 --> 06:59:47.680 align:start position:0%
disincentivizing medical professionals
 
06:59:50.070 --> 06:59:50.080 align:start position:0%
from speaking out against emergency
 
06:59:52.230 --> 06:59:52.240 align:start position:0%
orders that could be resulting in
 
06:59:54.150 --> 06:59:54.160 align:start position:0%
patient harm
 
06:59:56.390 --> 06:59:56.400 align:start position:0%
yes i do think that that is a risk and i
 
06:59:59.510 --> 06:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
also think it's a risk that
 
07:00:01.510 --> 07:00:01.520 align:start position:0%
when you include things like vaccinating
 
07:00:03.190 --> 07:00:03.200 align:start position:0%
your employees and saying that you have
 
07:00:06.150 --> 07:00:06.160 align:start position:0%
no liability for that and citing this
 
07:00:07.910 --> 07:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
law as your reason
 
07:00:09.830 --> 07:00:09.840 align:start position:0%
that really gave gives me pause and
 
07:00:11.590 --> 07:00:11.600 align:start position:0%
gives me a lot of concern
 
07:00:13.750 --> 07:00:13.760 align:start position:0%
i'd rather leave it in the hands of the
 
07:00:16.708 --> 07:00:16.718 align:start position:0%
judicial system if there is a true harm
 
07:00:16.718 --> 07:00:17.670 align:start position:0%
judicial system if there is a true harm
that

07:00:17.670 --> 07:00:17.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:00:19.190 --> 07:00:19.200 align:start position:0%
that rises above the fact that we were
 
07:00:20.548 --> 07:00:20.558 align:start position:0%
all just trying to figure out how to
 
07:00:22.708 --> 07:00:22.718 align:start position:0%
deal with this
 
07:00:26.548 --> 07:00:26.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:29.750 --> 07:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and i
 
07:00:33.280 --> 07:00:33.290 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if one of the underlying
 
07:00:33.290 --> 07:00:34.948 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if one of the underlying
[Music]

07:00:34.948 --> 07:00:34.958 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
07:00:37.270 --> 07:00:37.280 align:start position:0%
goals of
 
07:00:37.280 --> 07:00:38.788 align:start position:0%
goals of
the

07:00:38.788 --> 07:00:38.798 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:00:40.948 --> 07:00:40.958 align:start position:0%
original legislation
 
07:00:43.430 --> 07:00:43.440 align:start position:0%
was not only
 
07:00:43.440 --> 07:00:45.670 align:start position:0%
was not only
to

07:00:45.670 --> 07:00:45.680 align:start position:0%
to
 
07:00:45.680 --> 07:00:48.548 align:start position:0%
to
um

07:00:48.548 --> 07:00:48.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:48.558 --> 07:00:50.310 align:start position:0%
 
so

07:00:50.310 --> 07:00:50.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:00:52.070 --> 07:00:52.080 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if was
 
07:00:53.830 --> 07:00:53.840 align:start position:0%
if you agree with me that one of the
 
07:00:53.840 --> 07:00:55.590 align:start position:0%
if you agree with me that one of the
goals

07:00:55.590 --> 07:00:55.600 align:start position:0%
goals
 
07:00:58.310 --> 07:00:58.320 align:start position:0%
under the underlying legislation was not
 
07:00:58.320 --> 07:00:59.350 align:start position:0%
under the underlying legislation was not
only

07:00:59.350 --> 07:00:59.360 align:start position:0%
only
 
07:01:02.150 --> 07:01:02.160 align:start position:0%
to dictate the outcome of the legis of
 
07:01:04.868 --> 07:01:04.878 align:start position:0%
of a court case but also
 
07:01:07.590 --> 07:01:07.600 align:start position:0%
to prevent costly
 
07:01:10.070 --> 07:01:10.080 align:start position:0%
long litigious
 
07:01:12.788 --> 07:01:12.798 align:start position:0%
litigation from being filed and thus
 
07:01:12.798 --> 07:01:14.468 align:start position:0%
litigation from being filed and thus
diverting

07:01:14.468 --> 07:01:14.478 align:start position:0%
diverting
 
07:01:14.478 --> 07:01:15.750 align:start position:0%
diverting
more

07:01:15.750 --> 07:01:15.760 align:start position:0%
more
 
07:01:15.760 --> 07:01:18.070 align:start position:0%
more
much-needed

07:01:18.070 --> 07:01:18.080 align:start position:0%
much-needed
 
07:01:20.708 --> 07:01:20.718 align:start position:0%
assets from the health care system
 
07:01:20.718 --> 07:01:23.270 align:start position:0%
assets from the health care system
and

07:01:23.270 --> 07:01:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:23.280 --> 07:01:25.670 align:start position:0%
 
wouldn't

07:01:25.670 --> 07:01:25.680 align:start position:0%
wouldn't
 
07:01:29.590 --> 07:01:29.600 align:start position:0%
the existence of the statute as it is
 
07:01:31.430 --> 07:01:31.440 align:start position:0%
at a minimum
 
07:01:34.150 --> 07:01:34.160 align:start position:0%
deter those suits so they wouldn't have
 
07:01:36.230 --> 07:01:36.240 align:start position:0%
to go all the way through the judicial
 
07:01:36.240 --> 07:01:37.270 align:start position:0%
to go all the way through the judicial
system

07:01:37.270 --> 07:01:37.280 align:start position:0%
system
 
07:01:39.910 --> 07:01:39.920 align:start position:0%
whether you agree with that as the right
 
07:01:41.830 --> 07:01:41.840 align:start position:0%
way to proceed or not is wouldn't that
 
07:01:43.910 --> 07:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
be the effect of having the limitation
 
07:01:46.628 --> 07:01:46.638 align:start position:0%
of liability right there well thank you
 
07:01:48.548 --> 07:01:48.558 align:start position:0%
and i this brings up why i'm thankful to
 
07:01:50.788 --> 07:01:50.798 align:start position:0%
live in new hampshire and not california
 
07:01:52.468 --> 07:01:52.478 align:start position:0%
our system is set up so that you don't
 
07:01:54.310 --> 07:01:54.320 align:start position:0%
get the same kind of frivolous lawsuits
 
07:01:56.070 --> 07:01:56.080 align:start position:0%
that you see in other states
 
07:01:57.750 --> 07:01:57.760 align:start position:0%
it already is a high bar to bring a
 
07:01:59.830 --> 07:01:59.840 align:start position:0%
lawsuit in new hampshire far higher than
 
07:02:02.310 --> 07:02:02.320 align:start position:0%
many other states and i don't think that
 
07:02:03.590 --> 07:02:03.600 align:start position:0%
you would see
 
07:02:06.390 --> 07:02:06.400 align:start position:0%
lawyers bringing cases that bringing
 
07:02:09.350 --> 07:02:09.360 align:start position:0%
frivolous cases forward
 
07:02:09.360 --> 07:02:12.708 align:start position:0%
frivolous cases forward
okay

07:02:12.708 --> 07:02:12.718 align:start position:0%

yes
 
07:02:26.788 --> 07:02:26.798 align:start position:0%
we are in a non-germane amendment
 
07:02:29.750 --> 07:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
hearing that was noticed for
 
07:02:29.760 --> 07:02:31.830 align:start position:0%
hearing that was noticed for
one

07:02:31.830 --> 07:02:31.840 align:start position:0%
one
 
07:02:31.840 --> 07:02:33.030 align:start position:0%
one
uh

07:02:33.030 --> 07:02:33.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:02:33.040 --> 07:02:34.230 align:start position:0%
uh
amendment

07:02:34.230 --> 07:02:34.240 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
07:02:36.788 --> 07:02:36.798 align:start position:0%
okay and i
 
07:02:39.670 --> 07:02:39.680 align:start position:0%
sincerely don't know the answer to
 
07:02:42.708 --> 07:02:42.718 align:start position:0%
whether we can in a non-germane
 
07:02:45.110 --> 07:02:45.120 align:start position:0%
amendment hearing
 
07:02:48.390 --> 07:02:48.400 align:start position:0%
on a specifically noticed amendment take
 
07:02:51.030 --> 07:02:51.040 align:start position:0%
up a different amendment i would think
 
07:02:53.110 --> 07:02:53.120 align:start position:0%
that we could probably
 
07:02:53.120 --> 07:02:55.110 align:start position:0%
that we could probably
um

07:02:55.110 --> 07:02:55.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:02:58.070 --> 07:02:58.080 align:start position:0%
put the hearing on recess then go into
 
07:03:00.788 --> 07:03:00.798 align:start position:0%
executive session on the bill where then
 
07:03:02.830 --> 07:03:02.840 align:start position:0%
we take up and look at the second
 
07:03:04.948 --> 07:03:04.958 align:start position:0%
amendment could we
 
07:03:06.628 --> 07:03:06.638 align:start position:0%
you would be within your rights to do
 
07:03:08.070 --> 07:03:08.080 align:start position:0%
that i believe
 
07:03:10.230 --> 07:03:10.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:03:12.310 --> 07:03:12.320 align:start position:0%
but mr chair point of order why would we
 
07:03:14.390 --> 07:03:14.400 align:start position:0%
not finish hearing the testimony on this
 
07:03:16.948 --> 07:03:16.958 align:start position:0%
one thing our brain is on this now what
 
07:03:19.190 --> 07:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
are you asking me i'm asking why would
 
07:03:21.590 --> 07:03:21.600 align:start position:0%
we shift gears our brain is currently
 
07:03:22.948 --> 07:03:22.958 align:start position:0%
working on this amendment and just
 
07:03:24.708 --> 07:03:24.718 align:start position:0%
suddenly we are currently working on
 
07:03:26.310 --> 07:03:26.320 align:start position:0%
this amendment that there is another
 
07:03:28.468 --> 07:03:28.478 align:start position:0%
amendment the sponsor of the original
 
07:03:31.670 --> 07:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
bill offered we could push this off to
 
07:03:33.830 --> 07:03:33.840 align:start position:0%
march 7th and 8th which i fear is
 
07:03:35.990 --> 07:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
becoming 7th 8th and 9th
 
07:03:38.788 --> 07:03:38.798 align:start position:0%
but but could we not hear all of
 
07:03:41.830 --> 07:03:41.840 align:start position:0%
amendment 1271 and the responses from
 
07:03:44.230 --> 07:03:44.240 align:start position:0%
people who came here to deal with
 
07:03:46.310 --> 07:03:46.320 align:start position:0%
amendment 1271
 
07:03:48.548 --> 07:03:48.558 align:start position:0%
so they don't have to sit through the
 
07:03:50.628 --> 07:03:50.638 align:start position:0%
next one if they don't choose to i'm
 
07:03:53.350 --> 07:03:53.360 align:start position:0%
taking it in a specific order but but
 
07:03:55.590 --> 07:03:55.600 align:start position:0%
could we not finish the hearing that we
 
07:03:57.510 --> 07:03:57.520 align:start position:0%
just started yes that is what i'm
 
07:04:00.230 --> 07:04:00.240 align:start position:0%
attempting to do
 
07:04:02.788 --> 07:04:02.798 align:start position:0%

[Music]

07:04:58.430 --> 07:04:58.440 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
07:05:01.190 --> 07:05:01.200 align:start position:0%
rsa21p42a was sound public policy when
 
07:05:03.030 --> 07:05:03.040 align:start position:0%
it was passed last year with
 
07:05:05.350 --> 07:05:05.360 align:start position:0%
overwhelming support and it remained
 
07:05:08.310 --> 07:05:08.320 align:start position:0%
sound public policy because the reasons
 
07:05:10.708 --> 07:05:10.718 align:start position:0%
the law was enacted in the first place
 
07:05:13.270 --> 07:05:13.280 align:start position:0%
remain in effect today
 
07:05:16.150 --> 07:05:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:05:17.750 --> 07:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
the law confirms the legislation
 
07:05:17.760 --> 07:05:18.628 align:start position:0%
the law confirms the legislation
chairman

07:05:18.628 --> 07:05:18.638 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
07:05:21.350 --> 07:05:21.360 align:start position:0%
would you suspend please we only had 10
 
07:05:23.990 --> 07:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
copies for a 21-person committee we will
 
07:05:26.070 --> 07:05:26.080 align:start position:0%
attempt to get everyone in the committee
 
07:05:27.990 --> 07:05:28.000 align:start position:0%
your written testimony
 
07:05:30.548 --> 07:05:30.558 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i have another point uh the
 
07:05:32.150 --> 07:05:32.160 align:start position:0%
i appreciate the
 
07:05:33.430 --> 07:05:33.440 align:start position:0%
the chairman from catholic medical
 
07:05:35.110 --> 07:05:35.120 align:start position:0%
center being here but he's literally
 
07:05:36.548 --> 07:05:36.558 align:start position:0%
verbatim reading what he's passing out
 
07:05:38.468 --> 07:05:38.478 align:start position:0%
do not read your testimony
 
07:05:43.510 --> 07:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:05:46.948 --> 07:05:46.958 align:start position:0%
i'll go off script thank you
 
07:05:48.548 --> 07:05:48.558 align:start position:0%
you know maybe i'll do it by actually
 
07:05:48.558 --> 07:05:49.990 align:start position:0%
you know maybe i'll do it by actually
just

07:05:49.990 --> 07:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
just
 
07:05:51.510 --> 07:05:51.520 align:start position:0%
kind of sharing my opinion to some of
 
07:05:53.670 --> 07:05:53.680 align:start position:0%
the engagement that was done here
 
07:05:53.680 --> 07:05:55.510 align:start position:0%
the engagement that was done here
earlier

07:05:55.510 --> 07:05:55.520 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
07:05:58.310 --> 07:05:58.320 align:start position:0%
i do think that there are a number of
 
07:05:59.990 --> 07:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
reasons why
 
07:06:01.350 --> 07:06:01.360 align:start position:0%
you still need
 
07:06:03.190 --> 07:06:03.200 align:start position:0%
this bill in place
 
07:06:04.948 --> 07:06:04.958 align:start position:0%
you know in terms of the liability one
 
07:06:06.548 --> 07:06:06.558 align:start position:0%
the statute of limitations
 
07:06:08.150 --> 07:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
are still open
 
07:06:10.070 --> 07:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
so the risk and the liability is still
 
07:06:10.080 --> 07:06:12.310 align:start position:0%
so the risk and the liability is still
there

07:06:12.310 --> 07:06:12.320 align:start position:0%
there
 
07:06:14.788 --> 07:06:14.798 align:start position:0%
second there's no insurance coverage for
 
07:06:17.110 --> 07:06:17.120 align:start position:0%
this liability
 
07:06:18.948 --> 07:06:18.958 align:start position:0%
you know most insurance coverages that
 
07:06:20.948 --> 07:06:20.958 align:start position:0%
apply to hospitals have a lot of
 
07:06:23.430 --> 07:06:23.440 align:start position:0%
carve-outs almost carving out all of the
 
07:06:25.910 --> 07:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
coven-related liabilities
 
07:06:27.990 --> 07:06:28.000 align:start position:0%
and third the need is still there and
 
07:06:31.670 --> 07:06:31.680 align:start position:0%
one question was is rsa
 
07:06:36.948 --> 07:06:36.958 align:start position:0%
21p 42a null and void um no
 
07:06:39.510 --> 07:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
it's it's not our position that it's
 
07:06:41.270 --> 07:06:41.280 align:start position:0%
null and void i mean there are still
 
07:06:43.430 --> 07:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
emergency orders in place
 
07:06:46.230 --> 07:06:46.240 align:start position:0%
the governor's order has been um you
 
07:06:48.070 --> 07:06:48.080 align:start position:0%
know taken away
 
07:06:50.390 --> 07:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
but there still is a public health
 
07:06:53.110 --> 07:06:53.120 align:start position:0%
emergency order by dhhs
 
07:06:55.510 --> 07:06:55.520 align:start position:0%
which is in place and that further
 
07:06:57.750 --> 07:06:57.760 align:start position:0%
adopts a lot of these
 
07:06:59.830 --> 07:06:59.840 align:start position:0%
waivers and things that were put into
 
07:06:59.840 --> 07:07:00.708 align:start position:0%
waivers and things that were put into
place

07:07:00.708 --> 07:07:00.718 align:start position:0%
place
 
07:07:02.468 --> 07:07:02.478 align:start position:0%
and second the national order from the
 
07:07:05.590 --> 07:07:05.600 align:start position:0%
president is still in place originally
 
07:07:08.150 --> 07:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
so and you know one question
 
07:07:10.390 --> 07:07:10.400 align:start position:0%
representative weber um you were sort of
 
07:07:10.400 --> 07:07:11.830 align:start position:0%
representative weber um you were sort of
describing

07:07:11.830 --> 07:07:11.840 align:start position:0%
describing
 
07:07:14.628 --> 07:07:14.638 align:start position:0%
the need and the view of um you know
 
07:07:16.548 --> 07:07:16.558 align:start position:0%
some of these things that were needed by
 
07:07:18.628 --> 07:07:18.638 align:start position:0%
the hospitals to address the issues and
 
07:07:20.150 --> 07:07:20.160 align:start position:0%
the concerns
 
07:07:22.628 --> 07:07:22.638 align:start position:0%
and uh i'm struggling to kind of view
 
07:07:25.270 --> 07:07:25.280 align:start position:0%
this as mandates
 
07:07:27.510 --> 07:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
i think from the hospitals perspective
 
07:07:29.030 --> 07:07:29.040 align:start position:0%
these things were that were adopted to
 
07:07:31.670 --> 07:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
give the hospitals flexibility
 
07:07:34.150 --> 07:07:34.160 align:start position:0%
to meet the needs that were needed these
 
07:07:36.310 --> 07:07:36.320 align:start position:0%
were things like going beyond our
 
07:07:39.030 --> 07:07:39.040 align:start position:0%
license numbers to increase our capacity
 
07:07:41.510 --> 07:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
to do testing in parking lots and in
 
07:07:41.520 --> 07:07:43.110 align:start position:0%
to do testing in parking lots and in
tents

07:07:43.110 --> 07:07:43.120 align:start position:0%
tents
 
07:07:45.670 --> 07:07:45.680 align:start position:0%
to expand telehealth beyond what was
 
07:07:48.788 --> 07:07:48.798 align:start position:0%
permissible at the time from cms
 
07:07:50.548 --> 07:07:50.558 align:start position:0%
and there's there's other examples on
 
07:07:53.510 --> 07:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
and on and the doctors had concerns the
 
07:07:55.670 --> 07:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
doctors came to us and said wait a
 
07:07:57.830 --> 07:07:57.840 align:start position:0%
minute i know we need to do this because
 
07:07:59.910 --> 07:07:59.920 align:start position:0%
of the emergencies and the needs placed
 
07:08:01.910 --> 07:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
in the community but this is going
 
07:08:03.670 --> 07:08:03.680 align:start position:0%
beyond the standards of care and the
 
07:08:06.230 --> 07:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
licenses where is the liability for that
 
07:08:07.590 --> 07:08:07.600 align:start position:0%
going to fall
 
07:08:09.430 --> 07:08:09.440 align:start position:0%
and it was very comforting for them to
 
07:08:09.440 --> 07:08:10.230 align:start position:0%
and it was very comforting for them to
know

07:08:10.230 --> 07:08:10.240 align:start position:0%
know
 
07:08:10.240 --> 07:08:11.190 align:start position:0%
know
that

07:08:11.190 --> 07:08:11.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:08:12.548 --> 07:08:12.558 align:start position:0%
their actions
 
07:08:14.390 --> 07:08:14.400 align:start position:0%
were within the definition
 
07:08:16.708 --> 07:08:16.718 align:start position:0%
of emergency orders within the
 
07:08:18.628 --> 07:08:18.638 align:start position:0%
definition of our emergency management
 
07:08:18.638 --> 07:08:19.590 align:start position:0%
definition of our emergency management
system

07:08:19.590 --> 07:08:19.600 align:start position:0%
system
 
07:08:21.350 --> 07:08:21.360 align:start position:0%
and within the definite that their work
 
07:08:25.030 --> 07:08:25.040 align:start position:0%
as healthcare workers was in um you know
 
07:08:27.190 --> 07:08:27.200 align:start position:0%
as part of that system as well
 
07:08:29.830 --> 07:08:29.840 align:start position:0%
and i think that the immunity is narrow
 
07:08:31.670 --> 07:08:31.680 align:start position:0%
very narrow i put a lot of stock in the
 
07:08:34.070 --> 07:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
last two sentences of that statute
 
07:08:35.830 --> 07:08:35.840 align:start position:0%
where it's you know first of all it's
 
07:08:37.750 --> 07:08:37.760 align:start position:0%
specific to covin
 
07:08:40.708 --> 07:08:40.718 align:start position:0%
you still have to have reasonable
 
07:08:40.718 --> 07:08:41.830 align:start position:0%
you still have to have reasonable
actions

07:08:41.830 --> 07:08:41.840 align:start position:0%
actions
 
07:08:44.390 --> 07:08:44.400 align:start position:0%
and you have to be reasonably trying to
 
07:08:47.190 --> 07:08:47.200 align:start position:0%
address and comply with the flexibility
 
07:08:49.270 --> 07:08:49.280 align:start position:0%
as it's set out by the regulating
 
07:08:49.280 --> 07:08:51.110 align:start position:0%
as it's set out by the regulating
authorities

07:08:51.110 --> 07:08:51.120 align:start position:0%
authorities
 
07:08:52.788 --> 07:08:52.798 align:start position:0%
to act so i mean there are still our
 
07:08:54.468 --> 07:08:54.478 align:start position:0%
standards in place
 
07:08:57.590 --> 07:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
which i think keep the actions
 
07:08:57.600 --> 07:09:00.788 align:start position:0%
which i think keep the actions
reasonable

07:09:00.788 --> 07:09:00.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:09:05.708 --> 07:09:05.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:09:11.590 --> 07:09:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:09:13.270 --> 07:09:13.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
07:09:16.548 --> 07:09:16.558 align:start position:0%
taking my question so
 
07:09:18.948 --> 07:09:18.958 align:start position:0%
so is the reason for
 
07:09:18.958 --> 07:09:19.628 align:start position:0%
so is the reason for
the

07:09:19.628 --> 07:09:19.638 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:09:22.948 --> 07:09:22.958 align:start position:0%
dhhs state of emergency
 
07:09:26.150 --> 07:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
is it because the of the president's
 
07:09:28.230 --> 07:09:28.240 align:start position:0%
state of emergency orders
 
07:09:29.830 --> 07:09:29.840 align:start position:0%
since our
 
07:09:32.390 --> 07:09:32.400 align:start position:0%
state emergency orders that were put in
 
07:09:34.868 --> 07:09:34.878 align:start position:0%
place by our governor
 
07:09:40.788 --> 07:09:40.798 align:start position:0%
have been lifted why why is is dhhs like
 
07:09:43.430 --> 07:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
its own entity and and has more power
 
07:09:45.270 --> 07:09:45.280 align:start position:0%
than the governor i i'm not i'm i'm
 
07:09:49.190 --> 07:09:49.200 align:start position:0%
confused so at a high level and again my
 
07:09:50.948 --> 07:09:50.958 align:start position:0%
colleagues can chime in if they have a
 
07:09:53.270 --> 07:09:53.280 align:start position:0%
different take on this but at a high
 
07:09:55.990 --> 07:09:56.000 align:start position:0%
level for something like cms for example
 
07:09:56.000 --> 07:09:57.110 align:start position:0%
level for something like cms for example
medicare

07:09:57.110 --> 07:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
medicare
 
07:09:59.510 --> 07:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
um you know the the national order went
 
07:09:59.520 --> 07:10:00.390 align:start position:0%
um you know the the national order went
out

07:10:00.390 --> 07:10:00.400 align:start position:0%
out
 
07:10:01.830 --> 07:10:01.840 align:start position:0%
they then
 
07:10:04.070 --> 07:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
defined some waivers and things that you
 
07:10:05.350 --> 07:10:05.360 align:start position:0%
can do
 
07:10:09.030 --> 07:10:09.040 align:start position:0%
to have non-traditional ways of care dhh
 
07:10:10.948 --> 07:10:10.958 align:start position:0%
essentially adopts
 
07:10:14.708 --> 07:10:14.718 align:start position:0%
those waivers that are set by cms
 
07:10:17.670 --> 07:10:17.680 align:start position:0%
and so the i think the current emergency
 
07:10:20.868 --> 07:10:20.878 align:start position:0%
status that's in place is their way of
 
07:10:23.830 --> 07:10:23.840 align:start position:0%
continuing to accept this flexibility in
 
07:10:26.150 --> 07:10:26.160 align:start position:0%
place enabling the hospitals and other
 
07:10:27.670 --> 07:10:27.680 align:start position:0%
health care providers i'm from a
 
07:10:29.190 --> 07:10:29.200 align:start position:0%
hospital so i tend to see it from the
 
07:10:31.590 --> 07:10:31.600 align:start position:0%
hospital's perspective but other nursing
 
07:10:34.230 --> 07:10:34.240 align:start position:0%
homes and others so in order for them to
 
07:10:35.990 --> 07:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
adjust the way they're providing care to
 
07:10:40.230 --> 07:10:40.240 align:start position:0%
meet the needs dhhs is adopting those
 
07:10:48.628 --> 07:10:48.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:10:51.750 --> 07:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
so cms and dhhs can override the
 
07:10:51.760 --> 07:10:52.868 align:start position:0%
so cms and dhhs can override the
governor

07:10:52.868 --> 07:10:52.878 align:start position:0%
governor
 
07:10:54.628 --> 07:10:54.638 align:start position:0%
when he
 
07:10:58.708 --> 07:10:58.718 align:start position:0%
relieves state of emergency orders
 
07:11:01.350 --> 07:11:01.360 align:start position:0%
is that right is that am i correct there
 
07:11:03.590 --> 07:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
i'm not viewing it as they're overriding
 
07:11:05.510 --> 07:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
the orders i think there are certain
 
07:11:07.430 --> 07:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
aspects that came from the orders that
 
07:11:09.990 --> 07:11:10.000 align:start position:0%
dha determined that in the pursuit of
 
07:11:11.830 --> 07:11:11.840 align:start position:0%
patient patient safety pursuit of
 
07:11:13.750 --> 07:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
meeting the health care needs they have
 
07:11:16.310 --> 07:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
continued to adopt some of those things
 
07:11:18.230 --> 07:11:18.240 align:start position:0%
that are permissible from
 
07:11:22.468 --> 07:11:22.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:11:24.708 --> 07:11:24.718 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:11:24.718 --> 07:11:25.750 align:start position:0%
thank you
yes

07:11:25.750 --> 07:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
yes
 
07:11:28.390 --> 07:11:28.400 align:start position:0%
counselor i we were handed a
 
07:11:30.310 --> 07:11:30.320 align:start position:0%
handout and it says
 
07:11:32.150 --> 07:11:32.160 align:start position:0%
my name is john freiberg yes i don't
 
07:11:33.190 --> 07:11:33.200 align:start position:0%
think you are
 
07:11:35.510 --> 07:11:35.520 align:start position:0%
i'm not i apologize yeah i mentioned it
 
07:11:38.230 --> 07:11:38.240 align:start position:0%
over here and i should have made it so i
 
07:11:39.670 --> 07:11:39.680 align:start position:0%
passed out
 
07:11:41.590 --> 07:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
is written testimony
 
07:11:44.230 --> 07:11:44.240 align:start position:0%
from john freiburg who's general counsel
 
07:11:45.990 --> 07:11:46.000 align:start position:0%
for solution health he was unable to
 
07:11:48.070 --> 07:11:48.080 align:start position:0%
make it but he wanted to chime in with a
 
07:11:50.150 --> 07:11:50.160 align:start position:0%
letter i also handed out and i'm the one
 
07:11:52.708 --> 07:11:52.718 align:start position:0%
who brought only 10. i apologize
 
07:11:54.310 --> 07:11:54.320 align:start position:0%
copies of
 
07:11:56.868 --> 07:11:56.878 align:start position:0%
my written testimony does somebody have
 
07:11:59.030 --> 07:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
one of his that we can make additional
 
07:12:01.030 --> 07:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
copies for everybody
 
07:12:02.310 --> 07:12:02.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:12:06.548 --> 07:12:06.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:12:08.708 --> 07:12:08.718 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
07:12:11.590 --> 07:12:11.600 align:start position:0%
taking this question i'm a little um
 
07:12:15.190 --> 07:12:15.200 align:start position:0%
slow so i could use a concrete example
 
07:12:17.670 --> 07:12:17.680 align:start position:0%
of the kind of practice that's gone on
 
07:12:18.868 --> 07:12:18.878 align:start position:0%
during the
 
07:12:21.670 --> 07:12:21.680 align:start position:0%
emergency that might
 
07:12:23.510 --> 07:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
a hospital or a provider might be held
 
07:12:26.310 --> 07:12:26.320 align:start position:0%
liable for so are you saying
 
07:12:26.320 --> 07:12:27.190 align:start position:0%
liable for so are you saying
that

07:12:27.190 --> 07:12:27.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:12:29.590 --> 07:12:29.600 align:start position:0%
operating under the changing rules for
 
07:12:32.548 --> 07:12:32.558 align:start position:0%
medicare for telehealth for example
 
07:12:32.558 --> 07:12:34.948 align:start position:0%
medicare for telehealth for example
that

07:12:34.948 --> 07:12:34.958 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:12:36.948 --> 07:12:36.958 align:start position:0%
health care was delivered by telehealth
 
07:12:39.830 --> 07:12:39.840 align:start position:0%
as opposed to in person and therefore a
 
07:12:42.548 --> 07:12:42.558 align:start position:0%
diagnosis of a serious illness was
 
07:12:45.510 --> 07:12:45.520 align:start position:0%
missed and that person
 
07:12:47.910 --> 07:12:47.920 align:start position:0%
suffered the consequences of that
 
07:12:49.670 --> 07:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
and they
 
07:12:51.590 --> 07:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
chose to sue
 
07:12:53.830 --> 07:12:53.840 align:start position:0%
is this the kind an example of the kind
 
07:12:55.430 --> 07:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
of thing
 
07:12:58.788 --> 07:12:58.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:12:58.798 --> 07:13:00.150 align:start position:0%
 
liability

07:13:00.150 --> 07:13:00.160 align:start position:0%
liability
 
07:13:03.830 --> 07:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
the law about liability would address
 
07:13:05.990 --> 07:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
i think that could be an example yeah
 
07:13:07.590 --> 07:13:07.600 align:start position:0%
that you did tell the health and maybe
 
07:13:09.510 --> 07:13:09.520 align:start position:0%
something was missed but you did that
 
07:13:10.788 --> 07:13:10.798 align:start position:0%
because you didn't want you wanted to
 
07:13:12.468 --> 07:13:12.478 align:start position:0%
decrease community spread you want to
 
07:13:14.468 --> 07:13:14.478 align:start position:0%
also protect the doctors who are you
 
07:13:16.070 --> 07:13:16.080 align:start position:0%
know meeting with a lot of people that
 
07:13:17.510 --> 07:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
are sick
 
07:13:19.750 --> 07:13:19.760 align:start position:0%
but other examples are the alternative
 
07:13:22.548 --> 07:13:22.558 align:start position:0%
care site which i understand ultimately
 
07:13:25.030 --> 07:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
wasn't activated but here
 
07:13:28.230 --> 07:13:28.240 align:start position:0%
um you know elliott dartmouth cmc got
 
07:13:30.628 --> 07:13:30.638 align:start position:0%
together under the the purview of the
 
07:13:32.468 --> 07:13:32.478 align:start position:0%
national guard to put together the first
 
07:13:35.270 --> 07:13:35.280 align:start position:0%
alternative care site that was designed
 
07:13:38.548 --> 07:13:38.558 align:start position:0%
to handle overflows and if you think
 
07:13:40.868 --> 07:13:40.878 align:start position:0%
about it it was going to be staffed by
 
07:13:43.590 --> 07:13:43.600 align:start position:0%
elliott dartmouth cmc doctors and nurses
 
07:13:45.750 --> 07:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
we were going to pitch in work together
 
07:13:47.830 --> 07:13:47.840 align:start position:0%
well so how do you track that liability
 
07:13:49.110 --> 07:13:49.120 align:start position:0%
there if you've got
 
07:13:51.270 --> 07:13:51.280 align:start position:0%
one doctor from one organization and a
 
07:13:53.030 --> 07:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
nurse from another i mean it was pretty
 
07:13:54.628 --> 07:13:54.638 align:start position:0%
much a you know a headache trying to
 
07:13:56.548 --> 07:13:56.558 align:start position:0%
figure out how that was going to work
 
07:13:59.750 --> 07:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
this immunity enabled us to
 
07:14:01.430 --> 07:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
get that together and have it in place
 
07:14:03.030 --> 07:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
for a number of years
 
07:14:05.270 --> 07:14:05.280 align:start position:0%
and one more example would be
 
07:14:07.350 --> 07:14:07.360 align:start position:0%
um you know i think this this was done
 
07:14:09.030 --> 07:14:09.040 align:start position:0%
by a lot of other hospitals i don't
 
07:14:10.868 --> 07:14:10.878 align:start position:0%
think we did this at cmc in the last
 
07:14:13.110 --> 07:14:13.120 align:start position:0%
surge but you know if you ran out of
 
07:14:15.190 --> 07:14:15.200 align:start position:0%
beds even i think somebody mentioned it
 
07:14:17.910 --> 07:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
you have patients potentially in
 
07:14:20.310 --> 07:14:20.320 align:start position:0%
non-rooms i mean these could be the
 
07:14:22.628 --> 07:14:22.638 align:start position:0%
hallways or office rooms i mean there
 
07:14:24.390 --> 07:14:24.400 align:start position:0%
were adjusteds there that's that's an
 
07:14:26.468 --> 07:14:26.478 align:start position:0%
issue with your license so they were
 
07:14:29.030 --> 07:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
giving us the flexibility to do it
 
07:14:30.788 --> 07:14:30.798 align:start position:0%
uh follow-up
 
07:14:30.798 --> 07:14:31.590 align:start position:0%
uh follow-up
so

07:14:31.590 --> 07:14:31.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:14:31.600 --> 07:14:32.468 align:start position:0%
so
um

07:14:32.468 --> 07:14:32.478 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:14:34.310 --> 07:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
let's say one of those things happened
 
07:14:38.150 --> 07:14:38.160 align:start position:0%
with a negative consequence to a patient
 
07:14:40.150 --> 07:14:40.160 align:start position:0%
if this is repealed
 
07:14:43.030 --> 07:14:43.040 align:start position:0%
would the immunity
 
07:14:45.830 --> 07:14:45.840 align:start position:0%
the liability immunity
 
07:14:48.788 --> 07:14:48.798 align:start position:0%
remain in place if the event original
 
07:14:51.670 --> 07:14:51.680 align:start position:0%
event happened when this bill
 
07:14:54.150 --> 07:14:54.160 align:start position:0%
was in effect i mean when this statute
 
07:14:56.390 --> 07:14:56.400 align:start position:0%
was in effect
 
07:14:57.910 --> 07:14:57.920 align:start position:0%
you know that's a good question my
 
07:15:00.548 --> 07:15:00.558 align:start position:0%
understanding is that the repeal is is
 
07:15:03.110 --> 07:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
retroactive but i'm
 
07:15:04.868 --> 07:15:04.878 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure i guess i need to clarify
 
07:15:07.350 --> 07:15:07.360 align:start position:0%
that but i would also say though that
 
07:15:08.788 --> 07:15:08.798 align:start position:0%
you know
 
07:15:10.708 --> 07:15:10.718 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure you you're going to see the
 
07:15:12.868 --> 07:15:12.878 align:start position:0%
suits later in time so if it's not in
 
07:15:14.310 --> 07:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
place there i think it's definitely
 
07:15:15.350 --> 07:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
going to be something people are going
 
07:15:17.190 --> 07:15:17.200 align:start position:0%
to argue over and i think you're still
 
07:15:18.868 --> 07:15:18.878 align:start position:0%
going to litigate these things even with
 
07:15:20.628 --> 07:15:20.638 align:start position:0%
the immunity you're probably going to be
 
07:15:21.990 --> 07:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
litigating the immunity i think it could
 
07:15:23.350 --> 07:15:23.360 align:start position:0%
have that effect that you were talking
 
07:15:26.230 --> 07:15:26.240 align:start position:0%
about representative weber in terms of
 
07:15:27.910 --> 07:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
um you know perhaps
 
07:15:29.110 --> 07:15:29.120 align:start position:0%
uh you know
 
07:15:30.788 --> 07:15:30.798 align:start position:0%
maybe streamlining some of that but
 
07:15:32.548 --> 07:15:32.558 align:start position:0%
ultimately if you look at the language i
 
07:15:35.110 --> 07:15:35.120 align:start position:0%
think people are going to argue okay it
 
07:15:37.510 --> 07:15:37.520 align:start position:0%
wasn't reasonable or you know argue
 
07:15:40.868 --> 07:15:40.878 align:start position:0%
maybe it wasn't following the um
 
07:15:43.030 --> 07:15:43.040 align:start position:0%
you know the the the the waivers that
 
07:15:44.948 --> 07:15:44.958 align:start position:0%
you were trying to follow so i'm not
 
07:15:47.030 --> 07:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
sure it's taking away someone's day in
 
07:15:49.750 --> 07:15:49.760 align:start position:0%
court it's just giving another tool for
 
07:15:53.670 --> 07:15:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:15:57.270 --> 07:15:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:15:59.270 --> 07:15:59.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
07:16:01.750 --> 07:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
helping clarify all this stuff
 
07:16:03.990 --> 07:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at the underlying statute as
 
07:16:06.468 --> 07:16:06.478 align:start position:0%
it exists which would be repealed under
 
07:16:11.350 --> 07:16:11.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:16:13.750 --> 07:16:13.760 align:start position:0%
what would happen
 
07:16:16.708 --> 07:16:16.718 align:start position:0%
under the current statute
 
07:16:20.468 --> 07:16:20.478 align:start position:0%
if there was a new wave of coronavirus
 
07:16:24.390 --> 07:16:24.400 align:start position:0%
resulting in new emergency orders would
 
07:16:27.670 --> 07:16:27.680 align:start position:0%
that still provide the protection or has
 
07:16:27.680 --> 07:16:28.548 align:start position:0%
that still provide the protection or has
it

07:16:28.548 --> 07:16:28.558 align:start position:0%
it
 
07:16:30.868 --> 07:16:30.878 align:start position:0%
pretty much expired of its own weight by
 
07:16:34.070 --> 07:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
virtue of the last
 
07:16:35.750 --> 07:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
sentence which says this section shall
 
07:16:37.590 --> 07:16:37.600 align:start position:0%
not apply to actions performed after
 
07:16:39.590 --> 07:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
such an emergency order or rule is no
 
07:16:41.190 --> 07:16:41.200 align:start position:0%
longer in effect
 
07:16:43.430 --> 07:16:43.440 align:start position:0%
it's a good question it's a good point i
 
07:16:45.350 --> 07:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
i think it would um
 
07:16:47.350 --> 07:16:47.360 align:start position:0%
if there was a new emergency order
 
07:16:50.070 --> 07:16:50.080 align:start position:0%
declared and under that authority they
 
07:16:51.910 --> 07:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
were looking to give more flexibility
 
07:16:53.830 --> 07:16:53.840 align:start position:0%
for health care providers to address the
 
07:16:56.548 --> 07:16:56.558 align:start position:0%
need then this would be activated and of
 
07:16:58.150 --> 07:16:58.160 align:start position:0%
course it also has to apply to covid
 
07:17:00.150 --> 07:17:00.160 align:start position:0%
that's another way that this is limited
 
07:17:01.270 --> 07:17:01.280 align:start position:0%
but i mean
 
07:17:03.030 --> 07:17:03.040 align:start position:0%
yeah that's that's another benefit of
 
07:17:04.708 --> 07:17:04.718 align:start position:0%
having it in place here if things get
 
07:17:06.868 --> 07:17:06.878 align:start position:0%
bad or change or the variance change in
 
07:17:08.468 --> 07:17:08.478 align:start position:0%
a way that you know people get really
 
07:17:10.150 --> 07:17:10.160 align:start position:0%
sick you'll still have this in the
 
07:17:12.070 --> 07:17:12.080 align:start position:0%
toolbox to address it
 
07:17:16.230 --> 07:17:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:17:17.670 --> 07:17:17.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and also thank you
 
07:17:19.510 --> 07:17:19.520 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
07:17:22.230 --> 07:17:22.240 align:start position:0%
can you help me understand the interplay
 
07:17:22.240 --> 07:17:23.270 align:start position:0%
can you help me understand the interplay
between

07:17:23.270 --> 07:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
between
 
07:17:25.270 --> 07:17:25.280 align:start position:0%
this law and the prep back at the
 
07:17:27.110 --> 07:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
federal level because i believe the prep
 
07:17:29.510 --> 07:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
act which was activated back in march
 
07:17:31.750 --> 07:17:31.760 align:start position:0%
2020 and subsequently modified many
 
07:17:33.990 --> 07:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
times along the way provides a level of
 
07:17:36.548 --> 07:17:36.558 align:start position:0%
immunity to a lot of players in the
 
07:17:37.910 --> 07:17:37.920 align:start position:0%
market from
 
07:17:40.310 --> 07:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
not just providers but manufacturers and
 
07:17:42.310 --> 07:17:42.320 align:start position:0%
so forth etc with their products can you
 
07:17:43.750 --> 07:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
help me understand
 
07:17:45.590 --> 07:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
how that is different than what this is
 
07:17:48.468 --> 07:17:48.478 align:start position:0%
and are they duplicate are they
 
07:17:50.070 --> 07:17:50.080 align:start position:0%
supportive of each other help me
 
07:17:53.670 --> 07:17:53.680 align:start position:0%
understand the interplay between the two
 
07:17:55.750 --> 07:17:55.760 align:start position:0%
you know i apologize representative i'm
 
07:17:56.948 --> 07:17:56.958 align:start position:0%
not sure and i want to get ahead of my
 
07:17:59.670 --> 07:17:59.680 align:start position:0%
skis and give you a an incorrect answer
 
07:18:01.190 --> 07:18:01.200 align:start position:0%
so i haven't looked at that one in a
 
07:18:03.190 --> 07:18:03.200 align:start position:0%
while i don't know if
 
07:18:09.430 --> 07:18:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:18:16.388 --> 07:18:16.398 align:start position:0%
 
07:18:19.830 --> 07:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up if you could because
 
07:18:21.590 --> 07:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
what i'm trying to understand is that if
 
07:18:23.510 --> 07:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
this was to go away
 
07:18:25.670 --> 07:18:25.680 align:start position:0%
that is there a federal blanket that's
 
07:18:27.270 --> 07:18:27.280 align:start position:0%
going to protect the hospitals and
 
07:18:29.030 --> 07:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
providers regardless of what we do at
 
07:18:31.430 --> 07:18:31.440 align:start position:0%
the state level
 
07:18:33.190 --> 07:18:33.200 align:start position:0%
so i would like to follow up but i'll
 
07:18:35.910 --> 07:18:35.920 align:start position:0%
take a stab i mean i i don't think so i
 
07:18:37.990 --> 07:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
don't think this is duplicative i mean
 
07:18:41.990 --> 07:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
there are i think 32 states that have
 
07:18:44.388 --> 07:18:44.398 align:start position:0%
put in these immunities it's because you
 
07:18:46.948 --> 07:18:46.958 align:start position:0%
get the immunity through state law
 
07:18:48.868 --> 07:18:48.878 align:start position:0%
and i i don't think you get it through
 
07:18:54.150 --> 07:18:54.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:18:56.868 --> 07:18:56.878 align:start position:0%
representative konorick mine is just a
 
07:18:58.708 --> 07:18:58.718 align:start position:0%
clarification of something i think i
 
07:19:00.070 --> 07:19:00.080 align:start position:0%
understood you say
 
07:19:02.548 --> 07:19:02.558 align:start position:0%
so you are not certain whether it is
 
07:19:07.190 --> 07:19:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:19:08.628 --> 07:19:08.638 align:start position:0%
i'm not
 
07:19:11.110 --> 07:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
okay yeah
 
07:19:12.788 --> 07:19:12.798 align:start position:0%
represents under the impression that it
 
07:19:14.230 --> 07:19:14.240 align:start position:0%
was but again i don't want to i don't
 
07:19:17.110 --> 07:19:17.120 align:start position:0%
want to mislead i i need to check that
 
07:19:18.868 --> 07:19:18.878 align:start position:0%
representative kelsey
 
07:19:20.310 --> 07:19:20.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
07:19:23.990 --> 07:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question um can you clarify is
 
07:19:26.070 --> 07:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
um are visitors currently limited
 
07:19:28.628 --> 07:19:28.638 align:start position:0%
because of this statue or is this statue
 
07:19:31.590 --> 07:19:31.600 align:start position:0%
what enabled um you know visitors from
 
07:19:34.788 --> 07:19:34.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:19:34.798 --> 07:19:37.030 align:start position:0%
 
um

07:19:37.030 --> 07:19:37.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:19:39.110 --> 07:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
you know i'd have to check on that too i
 
07:19:42.150 --> 07:19:42.160 align:start position:0%
don't think there was a specific waiver
 
07:19:42.160 --> 07:19:43.270 align:start position:0%
don't think there was a specific waiver
addressing

07:19:43.270 --> 07:19:43.280 align:start position:0%
addressing
 
07:19:43.280 --> 07:19:44.708 align:start position:0%
addressing
visitation

07:19:44.708 --> 07:19:44.718 align:start position:0%
visitation
 
07:19:44.718 --> 07:19:46.310 align:start position:0%
visitation
policies

07:19:46.310 --> 07:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
policies
 
07:19:49.110 --> 07:19:49.120 align:start position:0%
those things stem from the patient bill
 
07:19:51.510 --> 07:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
of rights they stem from the hospital
 
07:19:51.520 --> 07:19:53.030 align:start position:0%
of rights they stem from the hospital
policies

07:19:53.030 --> 07:19:53.040 align:start position:0%
policies
 
07:19:55.590 --> 07:19:55.600 align:start position:0%
um so i i don't think there was a
 
07:19:58.468 --> 07:19:58.478 align:start position:0%
mandate or order coming down on that
 
07:20:04.070 --> 07:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:20:04.080 --> 07:20:05.830 align:start position:0%
 
representative

07:20:05.830 --> 07:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
07:20:08.070 --> 07:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
another hopefully short one uh one of
 
07:20:09.830 --> 07:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
the things i was at this was
 
07:20:11.830 --> 07:20:11.840 align:start position:0%
we have 21 people
 
07:20:13.510 --> 07:20:13.520 align:start position:0%
part of that whole
 
07:20:15.030 --> 07:20:15.040 align:start position:0%
exemption because that seemed to cover
 
07:20:16.230 --> 07:20:16.240 align:start position:0%
them i thought
 
07:20:18.070 --> 07:20:18.080 align:start position:0%
originally but is this just to clarify
 
07:20:19.910 --> 07:20:19.920 align:start position:0%
it make it a little more drive the point
 
07:20:19.920 --> 07:20:21.510 align:start position:0%
it make it a little more drive the point
home

07:20:21.510 --> 07:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
home
 
07:20:24.388 --> 07:20:24.398 align:start position:0%
it was to clarify and um you know a lot
 
07:20:25.830 --> 07:20:25.840 align:start position:0%
of work was done by the attorney
 
07:20:28.150 --> 07:20:28.160 align:start position:0%
general's office on this question and
 
07:20:30.388 --> 07:20:30.398 align:start position:0%
you know i i being an attorney i mean
 
07:20:32.628 --> 07:20:32.638 align:start position:0%
it's a pretty thorough opinion that they
 
07:20:34.788 --> 07:20:34.798 align:start position:0%
issued kind of slogging through the law
 
07:20:36.230 --> 07:20:36.240 align:start position:0%
and the authority on this and they
 
07:20:39.190 --> 07:20:39.200 align:start position:0%
concluded that yes this this work falls
 
07:20:41.910 --> 07:20:41.920 align:start position:0%
within the health care um
 
07:20:44.230 --> 07:20:44.240 align:start position:0%
you know the the emergency work of a
 
07:20:46.388 --> 07:20:46.398 align:start position:0%
health care worker um so it was a
 
07:20:49.350 --> 07:20:49.360 align:start position:0%
clarifying point but an important one
 
07:20:52.070 --> 07:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
you know relying upon an ag opinion
 
07:20:54.310 --> 07:20:54.320 align:start position:0%
versus having it in the statute is a is
 
07:20:56.868 --> 07:20:56.878 align:start position:0%
a much different position when it comes
 
07:20:56.878 --> 07:20:57.910 align:start position:0%
a much different position when it comes
to

07:20:57.910 --> 07:20:57.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
07:21:02.310 --> 07:21:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:21:04.070 --> 07:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
representative cushman
 
07:21:05.590 --> 07:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
07:21:08.310 --> 07:21:08.320 align:start position:0%
taking my question um could you please
 
07:21:11.110 --> 07:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
provide um some examples of the kinds of
 
07:21:13.430 --> 07:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
me of some of the medicare and medicaid
 
07:21:16.548 --> 07:21:16.558 align:start position:0%
waivers that um the hospitals needed
 
07:21:19.110 --> 07:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
this immunity from
 
07:21:21.510 --> 07:21:21.520 align:start position:0%
yeah i'll take a stab but i'm gonna go
 
07:21:23.350 --> 07:21:23.360 align:start position:0%
high level because you know again i'm
 
07:21:25.430 --> 07:21:25.440 align:start position:0%
just the the attorney on this and and
 
07:21:27.350 --> 07:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
not involved in operationalizing these
 
07:21:28.548 --> 07:21:28.558 align:start position:0%
things and i know it could be pretty
 
07:21:31.110 --> 07:21:31.120 align:start position:0%
nuanced but i think that
 
07:21:33.750 --> 07:21:33.760 align:start position:0%
the example i mentioned of seeing
 
07:21:36.070 --> 07:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
patients in tents and parking lots and
 
07:21:37.670 --> 07:21:37.680 align:start position:0%
things like that or doing testing in
 
07:21:39.350 --> 07:21:39.360 align:start position:0%
these alternative sites
 
07:21:42.310 --> 07:21:42.320 align:start position:0%
is a good example of those waivers
 
07:21:44.310 --> 07:21:44.320 align:start position:0%
going beyond the number of beds that
 
07:21:46.310 --> 07:21:46.320 align:start position:0%
your license provide i think is a good
 
07:21:48.628 --> 07:21:48.638 align:start position:0%
example of those waivers
 
07:21:50.310 --> 07:21:50.320 align:start position:0%
again i go back to the telehealth i
 
07:21:52.230 --> 07:21:52.240 align:start position:0%
think that was really more of a billing
 
07:21:52.240 --> 07:21:53.430 align:start position:0%
think that was really more of a billing
issue

07:21:53.430 --> 07:21:53.440 align:start position:0%
issue
 
07:21:56.150 --> 07:21:56.160 align:start position:0%
that they were enabling you to use that
 
07:21:58.948 --> 07:21:58.958 align:start position:0%
as a as a means to see patients um and
 
07:22:00.708 --> 07:22:00.718 align:start position:0%
we're able to bill for it so it's those
 
07:22:03.990 --> 07:22:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:22:05.430 --> 07:22:05.440 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
07:22:07.110 --> 07:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
07:22:07.120 --> 07:22:08.150 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
um

07:22:08.150 --> 07:22:08.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:22:09.670 --> 07:22:09.680 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
07:22:11.270 --> 07:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
for those things and i i'm sure that
 
07:22:12.948 --> 07:22:12.958 align:start position:0%
there are more
 
07:22:12.958 --> 07:22:13.990 align:start position:0%
there are more
now

07:22:13.990 --> 07:22:14.000 align:start position:0%
now
 
07:22:15.910 --> 07:22:15.920 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that the malpractice
 
07:22:17.750 --> 07:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
and negligence claims they hinge on what
 
07:22:19.430 --> 07:22:19.440 align:start position:0%
a reasonably competent medical
 
07:22:20.708 --> 07:22:20.718 align:start position:0%
professional would do in the same
 
07:22:20.718 --> 07:22:22.388 align:start position:0%
professional would do in the same
circumstances

07:22:22.388 --> 07:22:22.398 align:start position:0%
circumstances
 
07:22:24.708 --> 07:22:24.718 align:start position:0%
now in the in these dire circumstances
 
07:22:28.150 --> 07:22:28.160 align:start position:0%
that the hospitals were faced with
 
07:22:31.590 --> 07:22:31.600 align:start position:0%
i believe that in most scenarios since
 
07:22:33.510 --> 07:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
there's so many of you weighing in on
 
07:22:35.990 --> 07:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
those decisions that you'd have a
 
07:22:40.070 --> 07:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
reasonable argument in court that
 
07:22:41.670 --> 07:22:41.680 align:start position:0%
competent medical professionals would
 
07:22:44.150 --> 07:22:44.160 align:start position:0%
make those decisions
 
07:22:46.310 --> 07:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
would you agree so there really
 
07:22:47.830 --> 07:22:47.840 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be a need for you to have
 
07:22:49.670 --> 07:22:49.680 align:start position:0%
immunity from liability if you have
 
07:22:54.868 --> 07:22:54.878 align:start position:0%
plenty of ground to stand on in court
 
07:22:57.430 --> 07:22:57.440 align:start position:0%
you know maybe but you're leaving it up
 
07:22:58.310 --> 07:22:58.320 align:start position:0%
to a
 
07:23:01.910 --> 07:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
a judge that might not see it that way
 
07:23:04.070 --> 07:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
or a jury that might have a different
 
07:23:04.080 --> 07:23:05.590 align:start position:0%
or a jury that might have a different
interpretation

07:23:05.590 --> 07:23:05.600 align:start position:0%
interpretation
 
07:23:05.600 --> 07:23:06.468 align:start position:0%
interpretation
and

07:23:06.468 --> 07:23:06.478 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:23:08.548 --> 07:23:08.558 align:start position:0%
you know at the end of the day you're
 
07:23:11.110 --> 07:23:11.120 align:start position:0%
going to have somebody saying that here
 
07:23:13.110 --> 07:23:13.120 align:start position:0%
is what should have been done and this
 
07:23:14.548 --> 07:23:14.558 align:start position:0%
is what you did
 
07:23:16.628 --> 07:23:16.638 align:start position:0%
and without the immunity i think you're
 
07:23:18.948 --> 07:23:18.958 align:start position:0%
missing the link to explain
 
07:23:21.030 --> 07:23:21.040 align:start position:0%
why this was done
 
07:23:23.510 --> 07:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
and it was done to meet the needs
 
07:23:26.150 --> 07:23:26.160 align:start position:0%
and to ensure we can we can address this
 
07:23:28.628 --> 07:23:28.638 align:start position:0%
public health emergency
 
07:23:31.830 --> 07:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
question from the chair um
 
07:23:34.468 --> 07:23:34.478 align:start position:0%
i know from my lawyer friends that any
 
07:23:36.388 --> 07:23:36.398 align:start position:0%
case just about can be brought at any
 
07:23:37.990 --> 07:23:38.000 align:start position:0%
time no matter what
 
07:23:38.000 --> 07:23:39.430 align:start position:0%
time no matter what
nevertheless

07:23:39.430 --> 07:23:39.440 align:start position:0%
nevertheless
 
07:23:43.190 --> 07:23:43.200 align:start position:0%
when a lawyer who hopes to be paid when
 
07:23:46.310 --> 07:23:46.320 align:start position:0%
that lawyer wins sees the language about
 
07:23:46.320 --> 07:23:48.070 align:start position:0%
that lawyer wins sees the language about
immunity

07:23:48.070 --> 07:23:48.080 align:start position:0%
immunity
 
07:23:50.948 --> 07:23:50.958 align:start position:0%
he realizes or she that it's a higher
 
07:23:50.958 --> 07:23:52.230 align:start position:0%
he realizes or she that it's a higher
bar

07:23:52.230 --> 07:23:52.240 align:start position:0%
bar
 
07:23:54.310 --> 07:23:54.320 align:start position:0%
than that language not being there would
 
07:23:56.230 --> 07:23:56.240 align:start position:0%
you agree
 
07:23:58.708 --> 07:23:58.718 align:start position:0%
i would i would agree thank you
 
07:24:01.190 --> 07:24:01.200 align:start position:0%
any other questions for
 
07:24:03.430 --> 07:24:03.440 align:start position:0%
general counsel
 
07:24:06.548 --> 07:24:06.558 align:start position:0%
thank you so much thank you
 
07:24:09.830 --> 07:24:09.840 align:start position:0%

uh

07:24:53.350 --> 07:24:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:24:55.190 --> 07:24:55.200 align:start position:0%
good afternoon mr chairman members of
 
07:24:56.868 --> 07:24:56.878 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record my name is
 
07:24:58.628 --> 07:24:58.638 align:start position:0%
paula minihan senior vice president
 
07:24:59.990 --> 07:25:00.000 align:start position:0%

07:25:01.830 --> 07:25:01.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire hospital association
 
07:25:03.910 --> 07:25:03.920 align:start position:0%
representing all our hospitals community
 
07:25:05.830 --> 07:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
hospitals as well specialty hospitals we
 
07:25:08.388 --> 07:25:08.398 align:start position:0%
are opposed to house bill 1271
 
07:25:13.430 --> 07:25:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:25:17.190 --> 07:25:17.200 align:start position:0%
and i um this is um
 
07:25:17.200 --> 07:25:18.150 align:start position:0%
and i um this is um
we

07:25:18.150 --> 07:25:18.160 align:start position:0%
we
 
07:25:19.910 --> 07:25:19.920 align:start position:0%
honestly were a little unclear why the
 
07:25:21.830 --> 07:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
sponsor believes this repeal is
 
07:25:25.270 --> 07:25:25.280 align:start position:0%
necessary senate bill 1749 which was the
 
07:25:27.430 --> 07:25:27.440 align:start position:0%
bill that was passed last year
 
07:25:29.590 --> 07:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
passed by the full senate 24 to nothing
 
07:25:32.708 --> 07:25:32.718 align:start position:0%
and by this committee 1802 in the full
 
07:25:34.468 --> 07:25:34.478 align:start position:0%
house back in may
 
07:25:37.750 --> 07:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
created this statute that is now um
 
07:25:40.628 --> 07:25:40.638 align:start position:0%
being attempt attempting to repeal and
 
07:25:42.628 --> 07:25:42.638 align:start position:0%
we believe their law does remain
 
07:25:45.350 --> 07:25:45.360 align:start position:0%
relevant and necessary and we are
 
07:25:47.270 --> 07:25:47.280 align:start position:0%
concerned with repealing this could
 
07:25:47.280 --> 07:25:48.468 align:start position:0%
concerned with repealing this could
effectively

07:25:48.468 --> 07:25:48.478 align:start position:0%
effectively
 
07:25:50.868 --> 07:25:50.878 align:start position:0%
make what was legal in the past possibly
 
07:25:53.350 --> 07:25:53.360 align:start position:0%
retroactively at least unclear and could
 
07:25:56.388 --> 07:25:56.398 align:start position:0%
lead to possible legal challenges
 
07:25:58.548 --> 07:25:58.558 align:start position:0%
so um we
 
07:26:00.150 --> 07:26:00.160 align:start position:0%
the now that
 
07:26:02.230 --> 07:26:02.240 align:start position:0%
those that did exactly what the law
 
07:26:05.030 --> 07:26:05.040 align:start position:0%
asked of them are now exposed to
 
07:26:07.590 --> 07:26:07.600 align:start position:0%
liability for following the law and we
 
07:26:07.600 --> 07:26:08.388 align:start position:0%
liability for following the law and we
don't

07:26:08.388 --> 07:26:08.398 align:start position:0%
don't
 
07:26:08.398 --> 07:26:09.110 align:start position:0%
don't
we

07:26:09.110 --> 07:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
we
 
07:26:11.350 --> 07:26:11.360 align:start position:0%
that does not make sense to us and we we
 
07:26:13.110 --> 07:26:13.120 align:start position:0%
um we don't believe that should be
 
07:26:17.990 --> 07:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
allowed um i attached to my testimony
 
07:26:20.628 --> 07:26:20.638 align:start position:0%
the referenced attorney general opinion
 
07:26:23.590 --> 07:26:23.600 align:start position:0%
that attorney cole referenced
 
07:26:26.070 --> 07:26:26.080 align:start position:0%
it is long but as he said it was very
 
07:26:28.310 --> 07:26:28.320 align:start position:0%
thoughtfully done by then attorney
 
07:26:30.868 --> 07:26:30.878 align:start position:0%
general gordon mcdonald
 
07:26:33.830 --> 07:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
and i encourage you to read that but
 
07:26:37.430 --> 07:26:37.440 align:start position:0%
again that was not enough
 
07:26:38.948 --> 07:26:38.958 align:start position:0%
it was determined by our hospitals that
 
07:26:40.708 --> 07:26:40.718 align:start position:0%
it was not enough and we needed this to
 
07:26:43.510 --> 07:26:43.520 align:start position:0%
be codified in law and fortunately the
 
07:26:45.830 --> 07:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
governor um and and the legislature
 
07:26:48.468 --> 07:26:48.478 align:start position:0%
agreed and it was signed into law back
 
07:26:49.750 --> 07:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
in june
 
07:26:49.760 --> 07:26:51.190 align:start position:0%
in june
um

07:26:51.190 --> 07:26:51.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:26:51.200 --> 07:26:52.548 align:start position:0%
um
and

07:26:52.548 --> 07:26:52.558 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:26:55.190 --> 07:26:55.200 align:start position:0%
um i am referencing others that uh have
 
07:26:57.910 --> 07:26:57.920 align:start position:0%
um legal um background that can answer
 
07:26:59.910 --> 07:26:59.920 align:start position:0%
more specific questions but represent
 
07:27:01.350 --> 07:27:01.360 align:start position:0%
excuse me um
 
07:27:03.510 --> 07:27:03.520 align:start position:0%
attorney cole already did that so i
 
07:27:04.868 --> 07:27:04.878 align:start position:0%
think he answered a lot of your
 
07:27:07.430 --> 07:27:07.440 align:start position:0%
questions and mentioned the federal
 
07:27:09.990 --> 07:27:10.000 align:start position:0%
public health emergency and i think to
 
07:27:13.190 --> 07:27:13.200 align:start position:0%
representative delemus's point there's a
 
07:27:15.110 --> 07:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
public health emergency and then there
 
07:27:17.190 --> 07:27:17.200 align:start position:0%
is a state of emergency two different
 
07:27:19.670 --> 07:27:19.680 align:start position:0%
things and so the commissioner
 
07:27:22.070 --> 07:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
has the authority under under her
 
07:27:24.948 --> 07:27:24.958 align:start position:0%
authority to state law regarding the
 
07:27:26.548 --> 07:27:26.558 align:start position:0%
public health emergency that's the
 
07:27:30.070 --> 07:27:30.080 align:start position:0%
distinction i am also happy to provide
 
07:27:33.270 --> 07:27:33.280 align:start position:0%
more details on the cms waivers there
 
07:27:35.350 --> 07:27:35.360 align:start position:0%
are signif there are a number of them it
 
07:27:38.788 --> 07:27:38.798 align:start position:0%
had to do with signatures being required
 
07:27:42.708 --> 07:27:42.718 align:start position:0%
for certain things because of
 
07:27:44.788 --> 07:27:44.798 align:start position:0%
those that were not available it had to
 
07:27:46.468 --> 07:27:46.478 align:start position:0%
do with
 
07:27:48.310 --> 07:27:48.320 align:start position:0%
case management and certain things like
 
07:27:50.708 --> 07:27:50.718 align:start position:0%
that but i'm happy to provide with to
 
07:27:52.468 --> 07:27:52.478 align:start position:0%
the committee some of the waivers that
 
07:27:55.590 --> 07:27:55.600 align:start position:0%
remain in effect today under cms which
 
07:27:58.468 --> 07:27:58.478 align:start position:0%
is again medicare and medicaid um so
 
07:28:01.030 --> 07:28:01.040 align:start position:0%
that's why the state is
 
07:28:03.190 --> 07:28:03.200 align:start position:0%
following those as well happy to answer
 
07:28:05.670 --> 07:28:05.680 align:start position:0%

07:28:07.750 --> 07:28:07.760 align:start position:0%
representative cushman
 
07:28:09.350 --> 07:28:09.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
07:28:11.270 --> 07:28:11.280 align:start position:0%
taking my question ms minahan i'm
 
07:28:14.230 --> 07:28:14.240 align:start position:0%
looking at the attorney general opinion
 
07:28:17.270 --> 07:28:17.280 align:start position:0%
and i am looking at the question that
 
07:28:19.990 --> 07:28:20.000 align:start position:0%
you asked of the attorney general well
 
07:28:23.430 --> 07:28:23.440 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry commissioner shibana asked um
 
07:28:23.440 --> 07:28:24.468 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry commissioner shibana asked um
and

07:28:24.468 --> 07:28:24.478 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:28:25.590 --> 07:28:25.600 align:start position:0%
the answer
 
07:28:27.590 --> 07:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
to this question the question being does
 
07:28:30.030 --> 07:28:30.040 align:start position:0%
the immunity provided in
 
07:28:33.430 --> 07:28:33.440 align:start position:0%
21-p colon 41 apply to emergency
 
07:28:35.990 --> 07:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
management activities
 
07:28:38.548 --> 07:28:38.558 align:start position:0%
under the state of emergency and
 
07:28:41.110 --> 07:28:41.120 align:start position:0%
medicare medicaid waivers rules
 
07:28:44.388 --> 07:28:44.398 align:start position:0%
etc and the opinion was that yes that
 
07:28:46.230 --> 07:28:46.240 align:start position:0%
that rsa
 
07:28:48.628 --> 07:28:48.638 align:start position:0%
does did apply to those
 
07:28:50.548 --> 07:28:50.558 align:start position:0%
facilities employees and volunteers that
 
07:28:52.310 --> 07:28:52.320 align:start position:0%
were engaging in those
 
07:28:54.388 --> 07:28:54.398 align:start position:0%
management activities
 
07:28:56.310 --> 07:28:56.320 align:start position:0%
as long as they were complying with or
 
07:28:57.830 --> 07:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
reasonably attempting to comply with
 
07:28:59.990 --> 07:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
applicable state of emergency orders or
 
07:29:00.000 --> 07:29:01.030 align:start position:0%
applicable state of emergency orders or
rules

07:29:01.030 --> 07:29:01.040 align:start position:0%
rules
 
07:29:04.070 --> 07:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
so if that is true then why do we still
 
07:29:05.670 --> 07:29:05.680 align:start position:0%
need this section of law if there was
 
07:29:07.430 --> 07:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
already a section of law that gave that
 
07:29:10.468 --> 07:29:10.478 align:start position:0%
immunity um i think again in reading the
 
07:29:10.478 --> 07:29:12.070 align:start position:0%
immunity um i think again in reading the
entire

07:29:12.070 --> 07:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
entire
 
07:29:13.750 --> 07:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
opinion from the attorney general i
 
07:29:16.150 --> 07:29:16.160 align:start position:0%
think it's it's very instructive so i
 
07:29:18.628 --> 07:29:18.638 align:start position:0%
would um i would just suggest that
 
07:29:21.590 --> 07:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
that's why he went through step by step
 
07:29:23.270 --> 07:29:23.280 align:start position:0%
and again
 
07:29:25.350 --> 07:29:25.360 align:start position:0%
yes there may be those protections but
 
07:29:27.510 --> 07:29:27.520 align:start position:0%
that was not sufficient
 
07:29:30.310 --> 07:29:30.320 align:start position:0%
in the determination of of folks that
 
07:29:32.708 --> 07:29:32.718 align:start position:0%
were working on this and we requested
 
07:29:34.548 --> 07:29:34.558 align:start position:0%
that it be codified in law and we
 
07:29:36.230 --> 07:29:36.240 align:start position:0%
appreciate that the governor did sign
 
07:29:36.240 --> 07:29:37.830 align:start position:0%
appreciate that the governor did sign
that

07:29:37.830 --> 07:29:37.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:29:41.990 --> 07:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:29:45.110 --> 07:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you thank you
 
07:29:47.910 --> 07:29:47.920 align:start position:0%

honorable colleagues um
 
07:31:26.868 --> 07:31:26.878 align:start position:0%
the the only changes on this year was we
 
07:31:28.708 --> 07:31:28.718 align:start position:0%
changed it from a two-thirds vote to a
 
07:31:32.788 --> 07:31:32.798 align:start position:0%
three-fist vote and we updated the rsa
 
07:31:34.868 --> 07:31:34.878 align:start position:0%
that it related to uh
 
07:31:38.548 --> 07:31:38.558 align:start position:0%
on the very on line 10 rsa 141c 16 and

07:31:45.270 --> 07:31:45.280 align:start position:0%
reference
 
07:31:48.070 --> 07:31:48.080 align:start position:0%
was no longer valid
 
07:31:50.150 --> 07:31:50.160 align:start position:0%
because ols had not had the updated
 
07:31:52.070 --> 07:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
statutes at that time and they
 
07:31:53.830 --> 07:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
referenced the wrong one
 
07:31:56.230 --> 07:31:56.240 align:start position:0%
so that is the only change the original

but not to put too fine a point on it
 
07:32:09.788 --> 07:32:09.798 align:start position:0%
your amendment does not remove section
 
07:32:14.548 --> 07:32:14.558 align:start position:0%

07:32:33.270 --> 07:32:33.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman else thank you for
 
07:32:35.350 --> 07:32:35.360 align:start position:0%
taking my question i want to commend you
 
07:32:37.430 --> 07:32:37.440 align:start position:0%
on trying to find a way to use two words
 
07:32:39.190 --> 07:32:39.200 align:start position:0%
emergency legislative body in the same
 
07:32:39.200 --> 07:32:41.670 align:start position:0%
emergency legislative body in the same
language

07:32:41.670 --> 07:32:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:32:43.670 --> 07:32:43.680 align:start position:0%
so in saying that my concern is going to
 
07:32:45.670 --> 07:32:45.680 align:start position:0%
be three quarters of a vote like you did
 
07:32:47.750 --> 07:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
before it does reduce the barrier or the
 
07:32:50.070 --> 07:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
bar if you will but i do concern myself
 
07:32:52.788 --> 07:32:52.798 align:start position:0%
about the word emergency and the word
 
07:32:55.590 --> 07:32:55.600 align:start position:0%
legislature in the same paragraph
 
07:32:57.750 --> 07:32:57.760 align:start position:0%
because i don't see them
 
07:32:59.110 --> 07:32:59.120 align:start position:0%
it's almost like an oxymoron quite
 
07:33:01.510 --> 07:33:01.520 align:start position:0%
frankly so i'm looking at this saying if
 
07:33:03.750 --> 07:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
it's going to truly be an emergency
 
07:33:06.070 --> 07:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
i don't see the legislative body being
 
07:33:10.468 --> 07:33:10.478 align:start position:0%
the place to go to resolve it
 
07:33:12.788 --> 07:33:12.798 align:start position:0%
okay um but
 
07:33:14.230 --> 07:33:14.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question and thank you
 
07:33:16.310 --> 07:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
for the comment um the only thing i'm
 
07:33:17.910 --> 07:33:17.920 align:start position:0%
going to say to this body as we just
 
07:33:20.230 --> 07:33:20.240 align:start position:0%
heard in the previous testimony is that
 
07:33:21.830 --> 07:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
there is a difference between a state of
 
07:33:24.868 --> 07:33:24.878 align:start position:0%
emergency and a public health emergency
 
07:33:26.708 --> 07:33:26.718 align:start position:0%
which means that the
 
07:33:28.788 --> 07:33:28.798 align:start position:0%
in no reflection on the commissioner of
 
07:33:30.150 --> 07:33:30.160 align:start position:0%
health and human services because i
 
07:33:31.510 --> 07:33:31.520 align:start position:0%
think she's doing a great job and she
 
07:33:33.750 --> 07:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
has a great background however in the
 
07:33:33.760 --> 07:33:34.708 align:start position:0%
has a great background however in the
future

07:33:34.708 --> 07:33:34.718 align:start position:0%
future
 
07:33:36.788 --> 07:33:36.798 align:start position:0%
we may not have a commissioner with such
 
07:33:38.468 --> 07:33:38.478 align:start position:0%
a fantastic background
 
07:33:40.150 --> 07:33:40.160 align:start position:0%
and may choose to act on their own
 
07:33:43.270 --> 07:33:43.280 align:start position:0%
without consultation as we had mentioned
 
07:33:48.548 --> 07:33:48.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:33:51.990 --> 07:33:52.000 align:start position:0%
follow-up representative merchant
 
07:33:52.000 --> 07:33:53.430 align:start position:0%
follow-up representative merchant
i

07:33:53.430 --> 07:33:53.440 align:start position:0%
i
 
07:33:54.708 --> 07:33:54.718 align:start position:0%
i think i'll
 
07:33:56.788 --> 07:33:56.798 align:start position:0%
ask the question also to the chair does
 
07:33:58.628 --> 07:33:58.638 align:start position:0%
not have to be a question this is an
 
07:34:00.868 --> 07:34:00.878 align:start position:0%
exact session we can get away with our
 
07:34:03.670 --> 07:34:03.680 align:start position:0%
usual policy wow legally
 
07:34:07.670 --> 07:34:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:34:09.830 --> 07:34:09.840 align:start position:0%
in saying that one of the other things
 
07:34:11.350 --> 07:34:11.360 align:start position:0%
it was a compromise not trying to solve
 
07:34:13.350 --> 07:34:13.360 align:start position:0%
with a type of sex session
 
07:34:14.708 --> 07:34:14.718 align:start position:0%
there is a
 
07:34:17.030 --> 07:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight body
 
07:34:18.548 --> 07:34:18.558 align:start position:0%
to the department health human services
 
07:34:20.788 --> 07:34:20.798 align:start position:0%
there is is it possible at that point in
 
07:34:22.868 --> 07:34:22.878 align:start position:0%
time that that body becomes the place
 
07:34:23.910 --> 07:34:23.920 align:start position:0%
that you go to versus the full
 
07:34:26.230 --> 07:34:26.240 align:start position:0%
legislative body is that a po i'm trying
 
07:34:28.628 --> 07:34:28.638 align:start position:0%
to thread the needle here it can be and
 
07:34:31.990 --> 07:34:32.000 align:start position:0%
there's also a couple of other
 
07:34:34.310 --> 07:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
individuals in groups that are working
 
07:34:37.430 --> 07:34:37.440 align:start position:0%
their way through as point persons
 
07:34:40.150 --> 07:34:40.160 align:start position:0%
in an emergency for basically being a
 
07:34:41.830 --> 07:34:41.840 align:start position:0%
flying squad
 
07:34:44.868 --> 07:34:44.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:34:47.750 --> 07:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
representative soloway speaking of that
 
07:34:49.510 --> 07:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
07:34:51.910 --> 07:34:51.920 align:start position:0%
just a quick question representative you
 
07:34:55.270 --> 07:34:55.280 align:start position:0%
use the word legislature i assume that
 
07:34:58.868 --> 07:34:58.878 align:start position:0%
that term excludes the body on the other
 
07:35:01.430 --> 07:35:01.440 align:start position:0%
side of the wall
 
07:35:04.230 --> 07:35:04.240 align:start position:0%
i believe that they qualify as a
 
07:35:07.030 --> 07:35:07.040 align:start position:0%
legislature as well would you prefer to
 
07:35:08.388 --> 07:35:08.398 align:start position:0%
use the term
 
07:35:11.990 --> 07:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:35:15.510 --> 07:35:15.520 align:start position:0%
i do believe that we would need both
 
07:35:15.520 --> 07:35:17.270 align:start position:0%
i do believe that we would need both
bodies

07:35:17.270 --> 07:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
bodies
 
07:35:19.670 --> 07:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
to pass any law because that is how we
 
07:35:21.590 --> 07:35:21.600 align:start position:0%
do it in new hampshire
 
07:35:23.750 --> 07:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
and it's both bodies that represent the
 
07:35:26.150 --> 07:35:26.160 align:start position:0%
constituents so i do believe legislature
 
07:35:32.708 --> 07:35:32.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:35:34.388 --> 07:35:34.398 align:start position:0%
representative cushman
 
07:35:36.468 --> 07:35:36.478 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman just
 
07:35:39.270 --> 07:35:39.280 align:start position:0%
looking for a clarification on exactly
 
07:35:41.270 --> 07:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
how this plays out so the
 
07:35:41.280 --> 07:35:43.190 align:start position:0%
how this plays out so the
commissioner

07:35:43.190 --> 07:35:43.200 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
07:35:45.350 --> 07:35:45.360 align:start position:0%
just decides that he or she would like
 
07:35:47.590 --> 07:35:47.600 align:start position:0%
to order an individual
 
07:35:47.600 --> 07:35:49.270 align:start position:0%
to order an individual
to

07:35:49.270 --> 07:35:49.280 align:start position:0%
to
 
07:35:51.990 --> 07:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
receive treatment
 
07:35:52.000 --> 07:35:53.990 align:start position:0%
receive treatment
uh

07:35:53.990 --> 07:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:35:56.230 --> 07:35:56.240 align:start position:0%
or maybe quarantine
 
07:35:58.070 --> 07:35:58.080 align:start position:0%
if that's what it's alluding to under
 
07:35:59.830 --> 07:35:59.840 align:start position:0%
preventing an incident or a threat of
 
07:35:59.840 --> 07:36:01.670 align:start position:0%
preventing an incident or a threat of
disease

07:36:01.670 --> 07:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
disease
 
07:36:01.680 --> 07:36:02.708 align:start position:0%
disease
and

07:36:02.708 --> 07:36:02.718 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:36:05.030 --> 07:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
that in order to oh okay and then
 
07:36:09.350 --> 07:36:09.360 align:start position:0%
it may include immunization as necessary
 
07:36:11.910 --> 07:36:11.920 align:start position:0%
so they can they can require it if they
 
07:36:12.948 --> 07:36:12.958 align:start position:0%
get a three-fifth vote of the
 
07:36:15.830 --> 07:36:15.840 align:start position:0%
legislature but even if the legislature
 
07:36:18.070 --> 07:36:18.080 align:start position:0%
votes by three-fifths an individual may
 
07:36:21.270 --> 07:36:21.280 align:start position:0%
still refuse treatment or immunization
 
07:36:27.190 --> 07:36:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:36:28.548 --> 07:36:28.558 align:start position:0%
thank you representative cushman for
 
07:36:33.590 --> 07:36:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:36:36.230 --> 07:36:36.240 align:start position:0%
i was seeking to limit
 
07:36:38.468 --> 07:36:38.478 align:start position:0%
one person being able to dictate to the
 
07:36:41.590 --> 07:36:41.600 align:start position:0%
entire state versus in specific
 
07:36:44.230 --> 07:36:44.240 align:start position:0%
individual but ols put it under this
 
07:36:44.240 --> 07:36:45.590 align:start position:0%
individual but ols put it under this
particular

07:36:45.590 --> 07:36:45.600 align:start position:0%
particular
 
07:36:45.600 --> 07:36:47.350 align:start position:0%
particular
um

07:36:47.350 --> 07:36:47.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:36:47.360 --> 07:36:48.948 align:start position:0%
um
rsa

07:36:48.948 --> 07:36:48.958 align:start position:0%
rsa
 
07:36:48.958 --> 07:36:50.070 align:start position:0%
rsa
um

07:36:50.070 --> 07:36:50.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:36:53.030 --> 07:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
so i will defer because like you said
 
07:36:55.510 --> 07:36:55.520 align:start position:0%
there is which wasn't in statute when
 
07:36:57.430 --> 07:36:57.440 align:start position:0%
this bill was being drafted was the rsa
 
07:37:01.510 --> 07:37:01.520 align:start position:0%
141 c16 um that was not
 
07:37:03.110 --> 07:37:03.120 align:start position:0%
they did not reference that and did not
 
07:37:04.868 --> 07:37:04.878 align:start position:0%
notice that so we were only looking at
 
07:37:07.110 --> 07:37:07.120 align:start position:0%
the other statute that didn't recognize
 
07:37:07.120 --> 07:37:08.628 align:start position:0%
the other statute that didn't recognize
that

07:37:08.628 --> 07:37:08.638 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:37:10.388 --> 07:37:10.398 align:start position:0%
so maybe um
 
07:37:13.110 --> 07:37:13.120 align:start position:0%
i would defer to this committee to make
 
07:37:15.430 --> 07:37:15.440 align:start position:0%
the appropriate um
 
07:37:19.430 --> 07:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:37:21.270 --> 07:37:21.280 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro
 
07:37:23.350 --> 07:37:23.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman this is just a
 
07:37:25.430 --> 07:37:25.440 align:start position:0%
question about the mechanics of how this
 
07:37:27.030 --> 07:37:27.040 align:start position:0%
would happen um
 
07:37:28.948 --> 07:37:28.958 align:start position:0%
and it says three-fifths of the
 
07:37:32.310 --> 07:37:32.320 align:start position:0%
legislature so would that imply
 
07:37:33.990 --> 07:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
three-fifths of the house and then
 
07:37:36.150 --> 07:37:36.160 align:start position:0%
three-fifths of the senate or would it
 
07:37:36.160 --> 07:37:36.868 align:start position:0%
three-fifths of the senate or would it
be

07:37:36.868 --> 07:37:36.878 align:start position:0%
be
 
07:37:41.590 --> 07:37:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:37:43.670 --> 07:37:43.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question it would it
 
07:37:48.868 --> 07:37:48.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:37:51.510 --> 07:37:51.520 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
07:37:53.590 --> 07:37:53.600 align:start position:0%
representative canarck
 
07:37:53.600 --> 07:37:55.110 align:start position:0%
representative canarck
um

07:37:55.110 --> 07:37:55.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:37:57.430 --> 07:37:57.440 align:start position:0%
you have a little baffled i'm i'm still
 
07:37:59.510 --> 07:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
concerned about tying the hands of our
 
07:38:01.190 --> 07:38:01.200 align:start position:0%
public health
 
07:38:03.830 --> 07:38:03.840 align:start position:0%
experts in terms of dealing with a
 
07:38:03.840 --> 07:38:05.190 align:start position:0%
experts in terms of dealing with a
rapidly

07:38:05.190 --> 07:38:05.200 align:start position:0%
rapidly
 
07:38:07.590 --> 07:38:07.600 align:start position:0%
moving public health emergency that no
 
07:38:09.910 --> 07:38:09.920 align:start position:0%
matter how fast we think we can do
 
07:38:09.920 --> 07:38:10.868 align:start position:0%
matter how fast we think we can do
something

07:38:10.868 --> 07:38:10.878 align:start position:0%
something
 
07:38:13.110 --> 07:38:13.120 align:start position:0%
there is a delay in the legislature you
 
07:38:14.468 --> 07:38:14.478 align:start position:0%
have to have a notice that we're going
 
07:38:16.150 --> 07:38:16.160 align:start position:0%
to be having
 
07:38:17.750 --> 07:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
some kind of a bill or something i'm not
 
07:38:19.190 --> 07:38:19.200 align:start position:0%
sure we'd have to have hearings then we
 
07:38:20.868 --> 07:38:20.878 align:start position:0%
have to convene a house session then we
 
07:38:22.150 --> 07:38:22.160 align:start position:0%
have to vote
 
07:38:23.670 --> 07:38:23.680 align:start position:0%
uh we've just heard a lot of interesting
 
07:38:25.510 --> 07:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
things about liability is there any way
 
07:38:27.190 --> 07:38:27.200 align:start position:0%
we ought to think about the liability of
 
07:38:29.190 --> 07:38:29.200 align:start position:0%
the legislature for causing an increased
 
07:38:30.708 --> 07:38:30.718 align:start position:0%
number of deaths as you're waiting in a
 
07:38:32.948 --> 07:38:32.958 align:start position:0%
miniature meningococcal outbreak
 
07:38:35.910 --> 07:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
and not allowing us to mandate uh for
 
07:38:38.070 --> 07:38:38.080 align:start position:0%
example immunization and knowing that we
 
07:38:39.830 --> 07:38:39.840 align:start position:0%
might have a lot of people would die
 
07:38:41.990 --> 07:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
because of the delay
 
07:38:43.510 --> 07:38:43.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
07:38:45.830 --> 07:38:45.840 align:start position:0%
representative kanark and i can
 
07:38:45.840 --> 07:38:47.110 align:start position:0%
representative kanark and i can
understand

07:38:47.110 --> 07:38:47.120 align:start position:0%
understand
 
07:38:48.708 --> 07:38:48.718 align:start position:0%
the concern
 
07:38:52.548 --> 07:38:52.558 align:start position:0%
however i don't believe that a public
 
07:38:54.310 --> 07:38:54.320 align:start position:0%
health emergency
 
07:38:54.320 --> 07:38:55.110 align:start position:0%
health emergency
is

07:38:55.110 --> 07:38:55.120 align:start position:0%
is
 
07:38:57.510 --> 07:38:57.520 align:start position:0%
done immediately and i at least i would
 
07:38:57.520 --> 07:38:58.388 align:start position:0%
done immediately and i at least i would
not

07:38:58.388 --> 07:38:58.398 align:start position:0%
not
 
07:39:00.388 --> 07:39:00.398 align:start position:0%
i would hope that it's not done
 
07:39:02.070 --> 07:39:02.080 align:start position:0%
in haste
 
07:39:03.830 --> 07:39:03.840 align:start position:0%
and therefore
 
07:39:06.388 --> 07:39:06.398 align:start position:0%
there should be time
 
07:39:07.990 --> 07:39:08.000 align:start position:0%
for one to declare a public health
 
07:39:08.000 --> 07:39:09.430 align:start position:0%
for one to declare a public health
emergency

07:39:09.430 --> 07:39:09.440 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
07:39:11.910 --> 07:39:11.920 align:start position:0%
we they should be consulting with other
 
07:39:14.628 --> 07:39:14.638 align:start position:0%
folks and as we know we have a great
 
07:39:17.430 --> 07:39:17.440 align:start position:0%
commissioner however i'm looking at the
 
07:39:17.440 --> 07:39:18.788 align:start position:0%
commissioner however i'm looking at the
future

07:39:18.788 --> 07:39:18.798 align:start position:0%
future
 
07:39:20.548 --> 07:39:20.558 align:start position:0%
and i'm looking at somebody who could be
 
07:39:22.070 --> 07:39:22.080 align:start position:0%
in there that does not have the medical
 
07:39:23.750 --> 07:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
background that she has
 
07:39:25.590 --> 07:39:25.600 align:start position:0%
and the knowledge that she has and may
 
07:39:28.548 --> 07:39:28.558 align:start position:0%
not consult and maybe the the the answer
 
07:39:30.468 --> 07:39:30.478 align:start position:0%
to this is maybe not the legislature but
 
07:39:32.468 --> 07:39:32.478 align:start position:0%
one of these other commissions that she
 
07:39:34.230 --> 07:39:34.240 align:start position:0%
has to consult with
 
07:39:34.240 --> 07:39:35.510 align:start position:0%
has to consult with
um

07:39:35.510 --> 07:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:39:37.350 --> 07:39:37.360 align:start position:0%
so i'm just going to put that out there
 
07:39:40.830 --> 07:39:40.840 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
07:39:44.948 --> 07:39:44.958 align:start position:0%
weber thank you in light of the language
 
07:39:48.628 --> 07:39:48.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:39:48.638 --> 07:39:49.750 align:start position:0%
 
which

07:39:49.750 --> 07:39:49.760 align:start position:0%
which
 
07:39:52.788 --> 07:39:52.798 align:start position:0%
appears to me to give any individual the
 
07:39:54.468 --> 07:39:54.478 align:start position:0%
right to say
 
07:39:57.430 --> 07:39:57.440 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to have an immunization
 
07:39:59.590 --> 07:39:59.600 align:start position:0%
you know maybe maybe quarantine maybe
 
07:40:03.510 --> 07:40:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:40:08.548 --> 07:40:08.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:40:10.230 --> 07:40:10.240 align:start position:0%
thank you representative weber for the
 
07:40:10.240 --> 07:40:11.270 align:start position:0%
thank you representative weber for the
um

07:40:11.270 --> 07:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:40:11.280 --> 07:40:12.868 align:start position:0%
um
question

07:40:12.868 --> 07:40:12.878 align:start position:0%
question
 
07:40:12.878 --> 07:40:13.910 align:start position:0%
question
so

07:40:13.910 --> 07:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:40:16.548 --> 07:40:16.558 align:start position:0%
i know that the individual may refuse
 
07:40:16.558 --> 07:40:17.830 align:start position:0%
i know that the individual may refuse
treatment

07:40:17.830 --> 07:40:17.840 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
07:40:17.840 --> 07:40:19.510 align:start position:0%
treatment
but

07:40:19.510 --> 07:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
07:40:19.520 --> 07:40:21.830 align:start position:0%
but
maybe

07:40:21.830 --> 07:40:21.840 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
07:40:23.670 --> 07:40:23.680 align:start position:0%
they're being forced to or against their
 
07:40:25.990 --> 07:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
will or something
 
07:40:27.830 --> 07:40:27.840 align:start position:0%
i can't think of a circumstance at the
 
07:40:29.350 --> 07:40:29.360 align:start position:0%
moment and i would hope that i would
 
07:40:31.350 --> 07:40:31.360 align:start position:0%
never think of a circumstance where it
 
07:40:32.788 --> 07:40:32.798 align:start position:0%
could happen where somebody is being
 
07:40:34.868 --> 07:40:34.878 align:start position:0%
forced to against their will
 
07:40:34.878 --> 07:40:36.628 align:start position:0%
forced to against their will
however

07:40:36.628 --> 07:40:36.638 align:start position:0%
however
 
07:40:38.468 --> 07:40:38.478 align:start position:0%
is it better not to have some safeguards
 
07:40:40.388 --> 07:40:40.398 align:start position:0%
in place now
 
07:40:42.868 --> 07:40:42.878 align:start position:0%
before that happens
 
07:40:44.628 --> 07:40:44.638 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
07:40:50.070 --> 07:40:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:40:52.070 --> 07:40:52.080 align:start position:0%
sorry would it be helpful in terms of
 
07:40:54.070 --> 07:40:54.080 align:start position:0%
the issue about delay
 
07:40:54.080 --> 07:40:54.868 align:start position:0%
the issue about delay
if

07:40:54.868 --> 07:40:54.878 align:start position:0%
if
 
07:40:56.948 --> 07:40:56.958 align:start position:0%
number one under
 
07:40:58.868 --> 07:40:58.878 align:start position:0%
roman numeral five if it said the
 
07:41:01.590 --> 07:41:01.600 align:start position:0%
commissioner in consultation with the
 
07:41:03.750 --> 07:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
medical director of his department and
 
07:41:06.628 --> 07:41:06.638 align:start position:0%
dr chan would have his title is
 
07:41:10.230 --> 07:41:10.240 align:start position:0%
could then issue a thing and then
 
07:41:12.708 --> 07:41:12.718 align:start position:0%
the epidemiologist right and then at the
 
07:41:13.990 --> 07:41:14.000 align:start position:0%
end where it says the three-fifths
 
07:41:15.670 --> 07:41:15.680 align:start position:0%
majority if you think this is
 
07:41:15.680 --> 07:41:16.708 align:start position:0%
majority if you think this is
appropriate

07:41:16.708 --> 07:41:16.718 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
07:41:19.270 --> 07:41:19.280 align:start position:0%
and within 30 days that would have to be
 
07:41:21.190 --> 07:41:21.200 align:start position:0%
approved by a three-fifth majority of
 
07:41:23.270 --> 07:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
the legislature that would seem to give
 
07:41:24.868 --> 07:41:24.878 align:start position:0%
you i don't know if 30 days is enough
 
07:41:27.030 --> 07:41:27.040 align:start position:0%
time but i'm trying to keep it as short
 
07:41:29.430 --> 07:41:29.440 align:start position:0%
as you can as we discuss it but this
 
07:41:31.750 --> 07:41:31.760 align:start position:0%
would mean it would seem to protect us
 
07:41:33.910 --> 07:41:33.920 align:start position:0%
against a commissioner that may be a
 
07:41:36.628 --> 07:41:36.638 align:start position:0%
lawyer as was happened the last time but
 
07:41:38.468 --> 07:41:38.478 align:start position:0%
at least he'd have to have
 
07:41:41.350 --> 07:41:41.360 align:start position:0%
consultation with medical experts who
 
07:41:43.190 --> 07:41:43.200 align:start position:0%
could also call in other people if they
 
07:41:44.468 --> 07:41:44.478 align:start position:0%
so needed
 
07:41:46.468 --> 07:41:46.478 align:start position:0%
and then you'd have a 30-day delay
 
07:41:48.230 --> 07:41:48.240 align:start position:0%
before the legislature had to approve it
 
07:41:49.270 --> 07:41:49.280 align:start position:0%
would that
 
07:41:51.670 --> 07:41:51.680 align:start position:0%
seem to ease people's mind a little bit
 
07:41:53.670 --> 07:41:53.680 align:start position:0%
about this
 
07:41:53.680 --> 07:41:55.030 align:start position:0%
about this
no

07:41:55.030 --> 07:41:55.040 align:start position:0%
no
 
07:41:55.040 --> 07:41:58.150 align:start position:0%
no
sorry

07:41:58.150 --> 07:41:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:42:02.388 --> 07:42:02.398 align:start position:0%
 
07:42:04.628 --> 07:42:04.638 align:start position:0%
okay so do i still say thank you mr
 
07:42:06.310 --> 07:42:06.320 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
07:42:06.320 --> 07:42:07.670 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
question

07:42:07.670 --> 07:42:07.680 align:start position:0%
question
 
07:42:07.680 --> 07:42:08.548 align:start position:0%
question
okay

07:42:08.548 --> 07:42:08.558 align:start position:0%
okay
 
07:42:10.230 --> 07:42:10.240 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have to be a question it
 
07:42:13.350 --> 07:42:13.360 align:start position:0%
could be okay statement um well it is a
 
07:42:15.830 --> 07:42:15.840 align:start position:0%
question have you ever seen the state
 
07:42:15.840 --> 07:42:17.110 align:start position:0%
question have you ever seen the state
respond

07:42:17.110 --> 07:42:17.120 align:start position:0%
respond
 
07:42:19.030 --> 07:42:19.040 align:start position:0%
in a couple of days
 
07:42:22.388 --> 07:42:22.398 align:start position:0%
 
07:42:23.830 --> 07:42:23.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
07:42:26.150 --> 07:42:26.160 align:start position:0%
representative gay i can't say that i
 
07:42:28.708 --> 07:42:28.718 align:start position:0%
have personally but i'm not going to i
 
07:42:31.270 --> 07:42:31.280 align:start position:0%
mean but we do have people that respond
 
07:42:33.510 --> 07:42:33.520 align:start position:0%
to emergencies on a daily basis so i
 
07:42:35.750 --> 07:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
would never i would not you know
 
07:42:37.350 --> 07:42:37.360 align:start position:0%
just going to put that out there follow
 
07:42:39.510 --> 07:42:39.520 align:start position:0%
up follow up
 
07:42:41.270 --> 07:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
but in the context of what we're
 
07:42:44.548 --> 07:42:44.558 align:start position:0%
discussing a massive response to an
 
07:42:48.628 --> 07:42:48.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:42:51.350 --> 07:42:51.360 align:start position:0%
but in a medical situation
 
07:42:53.510 --> 07:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
there was no question
 
07:42:55.910 --> 07:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
that the rollout of the
 
07:42:55.920 --> 07:42:57.510 align:start position:0%
that the rollout of the
immunizations

07:42:57.510 --> 07:42:57.520 align:start position:0%
immunizations
 
07:42:58.468 --> 07:42:58.478 align:start position:0%
took a
 
07:43:01.510 --> 07:43:01.520 align:start position:0%
long time the idea that we can't wait
 
07:43:04.628 --> 07:43:04.638 align:start position:0%
five days to make a decision to me seems
 
07:43:06.070 --> 07:43:06.080 align:start position:0%
a little
 
07:43:06.080 --> 07:43:09.510 align:start position:0%
a little
disingenuous

07:43:09.510 --> 07:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:43:11.590 --> 07:43:11.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question uh
 
07:43:13.110 --> 07:43:13.120 align:start position:0%
representative gay
 
07:43:13.120 --> 07:43:14.948 align:start position:0%
representative gay
and

07:43:14.948 --> 07:43:14.958 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:43:14.958 --> 07:43:16.150 align:start position:0%
and
so

07:43:16.150 --> 07:43:16.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:43:19.430 --> 07:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
you are correct in this regard i mean we
 
07:43:21.910 --> 07:43:21.920 align:start position:0%
were using emergency
 
07:43:21.920 --> 07:43:23.670 align:start position:0%
were using emergency
immunizations

07:43:23.670 --> 07:43:23.680 align:start position:0%
immunizations
 
07:43:27.270 --> 07:43:27.280 align:start position:0%
for a pandemic
 
07:43:30.310 --> 07:43:30.320 align:start position:0%
so there was you know and it took
 
07:43:33.510 --> 07:43:33.520 align:start position:0%
several months for this to roll out
 
07:43:40.468 --> 07:43:40.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:43:43.030 --> 07:43:43.040 align:start position:0%
stephen pearson
 
07:43:44.868 --> 07:43:44.878 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i
 
07:43:46.628 --> 07:43:46.638 align:start position:0%
i had a thought here in reference to
 
07:43:48.230 --> 07:43:48.240 align:start position:0%
representative kenner's statement about
 
07:43:51.110 --> 07:43:51.120 align:start position:0%
the legislature having
 
07:43:53.030 --> 07:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
liability and i was just envisioning the
 
07:43:55.350 --> 07:43:55.360 align:start position:0%
size of the prison that would exist if
 
07:43:57.030 --> 07:43:57.040 align:start position:0%
legislators were held liable for
 
07:43:59.030 --> 07:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
screwing something up
 
07:43:59.040 --> 07:44:01.670 align:start position:0%
screwing something up
historically

07:44:01.670 --> 07:44:01.680 align:start position:0%
historically
 
07:44:03.830 --> 07:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
but along with that i have a question
 
07:44:05.910 --> 07:44:05.920 align:start position:0%
and now this is a substitute teacher
 
07:44:07.590 --> 07:44:07.600 align:start position:0%
question right because you know i don't
 
07:44:09.270 --> 07:44:09.280 align:start position:0%
hang out with you guys normally there
 
07:44:10.948 --> 07:44:10.958 align:start position:0%
was some reference to the oversight
 
07:44:10.958 --> 07:44:12.388 align:start position:0%
was some reference to the oversight
committee

07:44:12.388 --> 07:44:12.398 align:start position:0%
committee
 
07:44:16.230 --> 07:44:16.240 align:start position:0%
in in dhhs and i'm wondering
 
07:44:19.510 --> 07:44:19.520 align:start position:0%
does that committee have statutory
 
07:44:19.520 --> 07:44:21.350 align:start position:0%
does that committee have statutory
authority

07:44:21.350 --> 07:44:21.360 align:start position:0%
authority
 
07:44:21.360 --> 07:44:23.670 align:start position:0%
authority
to

07:44:23.670 --> 07:44:23.680 align:start position:0%
to
 
07:44:26.468 --> 07:44:26.478 align:start position:0%
interfere with the declaration of the
 
07:44:28.388 --> 07:44:28.398 align:start position:0%
commissioner of health and human
 
07:44:28.398 --> 07:44:29.910 align:start position:0%
commissioner of health and human
services

07:44:29.910 --> 07:44:29.920 align:start position:0%
services
 
07:44:33.430 --> 07:44:33.440 align:start position:0%
since i'm chair of that commission
 
07:44:36.788 --> 07:44:36.798 align:start position:0%
no i do not believe we do however we do
 
07:44:39.190 --> 07:44:39.200 align:start position:0%
give advice
 
07:44:41.990 --> 07:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
the commissioner comes to us every month
 
07:44:44.310 --> 07:44:44.320 align:start position:0%
and gives us an update and
 
07:44:46.708 --> 07:44:46.718 align:start position:0%
the worse the situation out there the
 
07:44:49.830 --> 07:44:49.840 align:start position:0%
longer she gives us an update and she
 
07:44:51.670 --> 07:44:51.680 align:start position:0%
listens to us
 
07:44:53.830 --> 07:44:53.840 align:start position:0%
so we have
 
07:44:56.708 --> 07:44:56.718 align:start position:0%
an advisory role presently
 
07:44:58.788 --> 07:44:58.798 align:start position:0%
fantastic and i think that's probably
 
07:45:01.430 --> 07:45:01.440 align:start position:0%
where the the
 
07:45:03.830 --> 07:45:03.840 align:start position:0%
the core of this comes from is it has to
 
07:45:05.270 --> 07:45:05.280 align:start position:0%
do with
 
07:45:06.868 --> 07:45:06.878 align:start position:0%
the fact that
 
07:45:08.868 --> 07:45:08.878 align:start position:0%
this is a check
 
07:45:11.590 --> 07:45:11.600 align:start position:0%
a check which the oversight committee
 
07:45:12.628 --> 07:45:12.638 align:start position:0%
does not
 
07:45:12.638 --> 07:45:13.510 align:start position:0%
does not
have

07:45:13.510 --> 07:45:13.520 align:start position:0%
have
 
07:45:16.628 --> 07:45:16.638 align:start position:0%
full authority to conduct and that's
 
07:45:18.868 --> 07:45:18.878 align:start position:0%
as i'm trying to wrap my brain around
 
07:45:21.190 --> 07:45:21.200 align:start position:0%
what we're asking here so that's uh
 
07:45:23.910 --> 07:45:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:45:25.750 --> 07:45:25.760 align:start position:0%
representative woods
 
07:45:27.590 --> 07:45:27.600 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair i just following
 
07:45:28.948 --> 07:45:28.958 align:start position:0%
up on the
 
07:45:30.628 --> 07:45:30.638 align:start position:0%
other representative
 
07:45:32.948 --> 07:45:32.958 align:start position:0%
peterson's question
 
07:45:35.190 --> 07:45:35.200 align:start position:0%
you meet once a month as the oversight
 
07:45:35.200 --> 07:45:36.388 align:start position:0%
you meet once a month as the oversight
committee

07:45:36.388 --> 07:45:36.398 align:start position:0%
committee
 
07:45:38.628 --> 07:45:38.638 align:start position:0%
do in fact
 
07:45:41.430 --> 07:45:41.440 align:start position:0%
is it does exist do you have issues that
 
07:45:43.830 --> 07:45:43.840 align:start position:0%
say this came up the day after a meeting
 
07:45:46.468 --> 07:45:46.478 align:start position:0%
you say oh we need to meet again and you
 
07:45:49.110 --> 07:45:49.120 align:start position:0%
have that ability or is it strictly
 
07:45:51.030 --> 07:45:51.040 align:start position:0%
the one month i called one special
 
07:45:51.040 --> 07:45:52.548 align:start position:0%
the one month i called one special
meeting

07:45:52.548 --> 07:45:52.558 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
07:45:54.230 --> 07:45:54.240 align:start position:0%
because we were behind
 
07:45:56.868 --> 07:45:56.878 align:start position:0%
are you you have that capability yes
 
07:45:58.150 --> 07:45:58.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:46:00.388 --> 07:46:00.398 align:start position:0%
so we could get together on the fast
 
07:46:00.398 --> 07:46:01.350 align:start position:0%
so we could get together on the fast
enough

07:46:01.350 --> 07:46:01.360 align:start position:0%
enough
 
07:46:03.670 --> 07:46:03.680 align:start position:0%
to as a group
 
07:46:03.680 --> 07:46:05.270 align:start position:0%
to as a group
render

07:46:05.270 --> 07:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
render
 
07:46:12.310 --> 07:46:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:46:15.350 --> 07:46:15.360 align:start position:0%
anything else seeing nothing else i
 
07:46:22.310 --> 07:46:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:46:24.868 --> 07:46:24.878 align:start position:0%
behalf of what i suggested well hang on
 
07:46:27.110 --> 07:46:27.120 align:start position:0%
i closed the exact session
 
07:46:30.548 --> 07:46:30.558 align:start position:0%
but i am wondering
 
07:46:33.110 --> 07:46:33.120 align:start position:0%
if there would be a group of four or
 
07:46:35.270 --> 07:46:35.280 align:start position:0%
five people who would like to hash over
 
07:46:38.388 --> 07:46:38.398 align:start position:0%
 
07:46:38.398 --> 07:46:39.830 align:start position:0%
 
or

07:46:39.830 --> 07:46:39.840 align:start position:0%
or
 
07:46:42.948 --> 07:46:42.958 align:start position:0%
next time we meet
 
07:46:45.030 --> 07:46:45.040 align:start position:0%
we vote on
 
07:46:45.040 --> 07:46:48.150 align:start position:0%
we vote on
amendments

07:46:48.150 --> 07:46:48.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:46:50.628 --> 07:46:50.638 align:start position:0%
and another amendment can be made before
 
07:46:50.638 --> 07:46:52.388 align:start position:0%
and another amendment can be made before
then

07:46:52.388 --> 07:46:52.398 align:start position:0%
then
 
07:46:55.510 --> 07:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
so that's your choices
 
07:46:57.750 --> 07:46:57.760 align:start position:0%
uh i'm not asking for a vote but sort of
 
07:47:00.548 --> 07:47:00.558 align:start position:0%
a head roll side decider up and down
 
07:47:03.590 --> 07:47:03.600 align:start position:0%
what is your thoughts about an ad hoc
 
07:47:06.548 --> 07:47:06.558 align:start position:0%
group trying to pull it all together and
 
07:47:15.110 --> 07:47:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:47:20.868 --> 07:47:20.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:47:22.548 --> 07:47:22.558 align:start position:0%
maybe i'm misunderstanding the question
 
07:47:25.190 --> 07:47:25.200 align:start position:0%
i can't hear you maybe i misunderstood
 
07:47:27.030 --> 07:47:27.040 align:start position:0%
the question yeah i'm looking for this
 
07:47:28.788 --> 07:47:28.798 align:start position:0%
if you don't think it's a good idea to
 
07:47:31.030 --> 07:47:31.040 align:start position:0%
have a group i'm looking for this if you
 
07:47:31.040 --> 07:47:31.910 align:start position:0%
have a group i'm looking for this if you
do

07:47:31.910 --> 07:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
do
 
07:47:33.990 --> 07:47:34.000 align:start position:0%
i was saying i would be happy to be a
 
07:47:35.910 --> 07:47:35.920 align:start position:0%
part of a group all right i don't see a
 
07:47:41.190 --> 07:47:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:47:44.388 --> 07:47:44.398 align:start position:0%
or how about a show of hands
 
07:47:46.310 --> 07:47:46.320 align:start position:0%
could i just say i can't speak for
 
07:47:47.750 --> 07:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
anybody but me
 
07:47:49.910 --> 07:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
i don't want to work on it so that's
 
07:47:49.920 --> 07:47:51.030 align:start position:0%
i don't want to work on it so that's
fine

07:47:51.030 --> 07:47:51.040 align:start position:0%
fine
 
07:47:53.510 --> 07:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
i'm shaking my head i don't object to
 
07:47:55.670 --> 07:47:55.680 align:start position:0%
anybody else who wants to work on it
 
07:47:57.590 --> 07:47:57.600 align:start position:0%
working on it i just wanted to make that
 
07:48:00.310 --> 07:48:00.320 align:start position:0%
clear because i'm i'm shaking only for
 
07:48:03.510 --> 07:48:03.520 align:start position:0%
myself any such group would represent
 
07:48:06.230 --> 07:48:06.240 align:start position:0%
people who are on a variety of opinions
 
07:48:09.190 --> 07:48:09.200 align:start position:0%
on this otherwise it really doesn't help
 
07:48:10.628 --> 07:48:10.638 align:start position:0%
how many of you
 
07:48:10.638 --> 07:48:11.430 align:start position:0%
how many of you
would

07:48:11.430 --> 07:48:11.440 align:start position:0%
would
 
07:48:14.468 --> 07:48:14.478 align:start position:0%
think a work group is a good idea put
 
07:48:17.590 --> 07:48:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:48:20.788 --> 07:48:20.798 align:start position:0%
i don't think we have enough
 
07:48:22.948 --> 07:48:22.958 align:start position:0%
and if we did it would only be probably
 
07:48:25.350 --> 07:48:25.360 align:start position:0%
people pretty much on one side so we
 
07:48:27.110 --> 07:48:27.120 align:start position:0%
will look on this
 
07:48:30.070 --> 07:48:30.080 align:start position:0%
on march 7th
 
07:48:32.388 --> 07:48:32.398 align:start position:0%
now we've got a few more things
 
07:48:32.398 --> 07:48:33.750 align:start position:0%
now we've got a few more things
and

07:48:33.750 --> 07:48:33.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:48:37.190 --> 07:48:37.200 align:start position:0%
we can execute these few more things
 
07:48:37.200 --> 07:48:38.388 align:start position:0%
we can execute these few more things
and

07:48:38.388 --> 07:48:38.398 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:48:39.910 --> 07:48:39.920 align:start position:0%
on the list
 
07:48:41.350 --> 07:48:41.360 align:start position:0%
i had
 
07:48:42.548 --> 07:48:42.558 align:start position:0%
sent to
 
07:48:42.558 --> 07:48:44.150 align:start position:0%
sent to
the

07:48:44.150 --> 07:48:44.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:48:47.110 --> 07:48:47.120 align:start position:0%
minority ranking member and who reminded
 
07:48:49.190 --> 07:48:49.200 align:start position:0%
me of that list which i totally forgot
 
07:48:53.750 --> 07:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
obviously was house bill 1369
 
07:48:56.230 --> 07:48:56.240 align:start position:0%
relative to covet health and safety
 
07:48:58.628 --> 07:48:58.638 align:start position:0%
policies at new hampshire performing
 
07:49:00.230 --> 07:49:00.240 align:start position:0%
arts venues
 
07:49:05.270 --> 07:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
i open an exec session on bill 1369.
 
07:49:07.910 --> 07:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
we heard it on february 7th
 
07:49:07.920 --> 07:49:09.030 align:start position:0%
we heard it on february 7th
and

07:49:09.030 --> 07:49:09.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:49:10.628 --> 07:49:10.638 align:start position:0%
i might even have
 
07:49:12.310 --> 07:49:12.320 align:start position:0%
the numbers
 
07:49:14.868 --> 07:49:14.878 align:start position:0%
do you have the numbers
 
07:49:23.110 --> 07:49:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:49:25.830 --> 07:49:25.840 align:start position:0%
i thought we did i mean shapiro is
 
07:49:31.350 --> 07:49:31.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:49:34.230 --> 07:49:34.240 align:start position:0%
representative leon to the rescue she's
 
07:49:36.230 --> 07:49:36.240 align:start position:0%
punching up numbers i thought i packed
 
07:49:42.788 --> 07:49:42.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:49:45.750 --> 07:49:45.760 align:start position:0%
and this is amendment 707 and i told the
 
07:49:49.300 --> 07:49:49.310 align:start position:0%
representative i thought 707 would fly
 
07:49:49.310 --> 07:50:04.468 align:start position:0%
representative i thought 707 would fly
[Music]

07:50:04.468 --> 07:50:04.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:50:06.310 --> 07:50:06.320 align:start position:0%
representative canark when you're seated
 
07:50:10.150 --> 07:50:10.160 align:start position:0%
tell us what amendment 707 does
 
07:50:12.310 --> 07:50:12.320 align:start position:0%
yes sir thank you very much um as we
 
07:50:15.270 --> 07:50:15.280 align:start position:0%
worked on this bill you may recall that
 
07:50:16.468 --> 07:50:16.478 align:start position:0%
there were
 
07:50:20.310 --> 07:50:20.320 align:start position:0%
a lot of uh issues that came up about
 
07:50:22.310 --> 07:50:22.320 align:start position:0%
trying to make it a little broader
 
07:50:23.670 --> 07:50:23.680 align:start position:0%
actually i should first say what it all
 
07:50:25.270 --> 07:50:25.280 align:start position:0%
had to do with the initial bill had to
 
07:50:26.388 --> 07:50:26.398 align:start position:0%
do with coven
 
07:50:27.830 --> 07:50:27.840 align:start position:0%
but we realized that it probably doesn't
 
07:50:28.948 --> 07:50:28.958 align:start position:0%
make a lot of sense to do a lot of
 
07:50:31.350 --> 07:50:31.360 align:start position:0%
legislating on covid and it might be
 
07:50:33.270 --> 07:50:33.280 align:start position:0%
better to think about being communicable
 
07:50:35.190 --> 07:50:35.200 align:start position:0%
disease in a general sense
 
07:50:36.948 --> 07:50:36.958 align:start position:0%
the question had been brought up as to
 
07:50:39.030 --> 07:50:39.040 align:start position:0%
why this bill was even needed to begin
 
07:50:42.388 --> 07:50:42.398 align:start position:0%
with and the discussion was simply that
 
07:50:44.150 --> 07:50:44.160 align:start position:0%
as venues tried to
 
07:50:46.468 --> 07:50:46.478 align:start position:0%
deal with this they sometimes had
 
07:50:49.190 --> 07:50:49.200 align:start position:0%
patrons who were complaining um and said
 
07:50:51.350 --> 07:50:51.360 align:start position:0%
you're not allowed to do this so as the
 
07:50:53.510 --> 07:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
patron sorry as the venue representative
 
07:50:55.110 --> 07:50:55.120 align:start position:0%
said it was simply to give them the
 
07:50:57.510 --> 07:50:57.520 align:start position:0%
backup yes indeed they did have the
 
07:50:59.430 --> 07:50:59.440 align:start position:0%
authority to set their own
 
07:51:02.468 --> 07:51:02.478 align:start position:0%
uh rules but as representative lang so
 
07:51:04.070 --> 07:51:04.080 align:start position:0%
nicely pointed out
 
07:51:05.990 --> 07:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
there is a contract between the venue
 
07:51:11.270 --> 07:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
and the um patron and that needs to be
 
07:51:12.788 --> 07:51:12.798 align:start position:0%
respected that uh if you're going to
 
07:51:14.628 --> 07:51:14.638 align:start position:0%
suddenly change the rules on them you
 
07:51:16.948 --> 07:51:16.958 align:start position:0%
should offer them a refund so we did
 
07:51:18.708 --> 07:51:18.718 align:start position:0%
work together in committee that day kind
 
07:51:20.708 --> 07:51:20.718 align:start position:0%
of did a little mini exec session and we
 
07:51:23.030 --> 07:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
did some work together to
 
07:51:25.110 --> 07:51:25.120 align:start position:0%
uh come up with some wording that would
 
07:51:27.190 --> 07:51:27.200 align:start position:0%
work reasonably well
 
07:51:29.190 --> 07:51:29.200 align:start position:0%
regarding giving
 
07:51:30.948 --> 07:51:30.958 align:start position:0%
uh refunds
 
07:51:33.110 --> 07:51:33.120 align:start position:0%
now the problem is then as i worked with
 
07:51:35.190 --> 07:51:35.200 align:start position:0%
the sponsor he said well you know the
 
07:51:38.150 --> 07:51:38.160 align:start position:0%
venues already have disclaimers on their
 
07:51:40.708 --> 07:51:40.718 align:start position:0%
website that things could change
 
07:51:45.270 --> 07:51:45.280 align:start position:0%
um and so i did insert that but i
 
07:51:46.868 --> 07:51:46.878 align:start position:0%
didn't quite agree with him completely
 
07:51:48.948 --> 07:51:48.958 align:start position:0%
because he just wanted to say that they
 
07:51:51.030 --> 07:51:51.040 align:start position:0%
you know that they could do that but i
 
07:51:52.948 --> 07:51:52.958 align:start position:0%
when i worked with some other people as
 
07:51:55.030 --> 07:51:55.040 align:start position:0%
well i think including tim lang we
 
07:51:56.388 --> 07:51:56.398 align:start position:0%
talked about the fact that it should be
 
07:51:58.708 --> 07:51:58.718 align:start position:0%
acknowledged so the bottom line is
 
07:52:00.788 --> 07:52:00.798 align:start position:0%
gets rid of all of the references to
 
07:52:02.388 --> 07:52:02.398 align:start position:0%
covet 19.
 
07:52:04.230 --> 07:52:04.240 align:start position:0%
it simply talks about communicable
 
07:52:06.548 --> 07:52:06.558 align:start position:0%
disease because that makes it scalable
 
07:52:08.230 --> 07:52:08.240 align:start position:0%
for future issues
 
07:52:11.110 --> 07:52:11.120 align:start position:0%
and even for any past issues i mean in
 
07:52:12.708 --> 07:52:12.718 align:start position:0%
other words we may have it doesn't have
 
07:52:14.070 --> 07:52:14.080 align:start position:0%
to be a new disease there could be an
 
07:52:16.388 --> 07:52:16.398 align:start position:0%
outbreak of meningococcus or any other
 
07:52:18.868 --> 07:52:18.878 align:start position:0%
number of things but this just allows
 
07:52:21.350 --> 07:52:21.360 align:start position:0%
the venue
 
07:52:23.030 --> 07:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
operators and by the way just to clarify
 
07:52:24.868 --> 07:52:24.878 align:start position:0%
too this is a replace all bill so you
 
07:52:26.310 --> 07:52:26.320 align:start position:0%
don't have to look at side to side you
 
07:52:28.230 --> 07:52:28.240 align:start position:0%
just look at this anyway allows the
 
07:52:29.670 --> 07:52:29.680 align:start position:0%
venue operators
 
07:52:32.310 --> 07:52:32.320 align:start position:0%
to put in whatever health and safety
 
07:52:33.910 --> 07:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
policies they wish it gives them the
 
07:52:35.430 --> 07:52:35.440 align:start position:0%
right as a business to set their own
 
07:52:38.070 --> 07:52:38.080 align:start position:0%
policies regarding masks or vaccines or
 
07:52:39.910 --> 07:52:39.920 align:start position:0%
testing or a combination
 
07:52:41.510 --> 07:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
for to protect the patron staff
 
07:52:44.388 --> 07:52:44.398 align:start position:0%
performers and their own investments
 
07:52:46.468 --> 07:52:46.478 align:start position:0%
but the point is the important lines
 
07:52:49.430 --> 07:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
that are new are page sorry lines 17
 
07:52:51.990 --> 07:52:52.000 align:start position:0%
through 20 that if the policies posted a
 
07:52:54.230 --> 07:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
time of ticket purchase relative to
 
07:52:56.310 --> 07:52:56.320 align:start position:0%
these issues change after you purchase
 
07:52:59.030 --> 07:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
the ticket that they shall therefore
 
07:53:01.110 --> 07:53:01.120 align:start position:0%
that's not an option shall refund the
 
07:53:03.350 --> 07:53:03.360 align:start position:0%
ticket price at the patrons request
 
07:53:05.350 --> 07:53:05.360 align:start position:0%
unless the patron has acknowledged that
 
07:53:07.270 --> 07:53:07.280 align:start position:0%
all orders are subject to venue policies
 
07:53:09.030 --> 07:53:09.040 align:start position:0%
at the time of the show which may be
 
07:53:10.310 --> 07:53:10.320 align:start position:0%
different than policies at time of
 
07:53:10.320 --> 07:53:11.190 align:start position:0%
different than policies at time of
purchase

07:53:11.190 --> 07:53:11.200 align:start position:0%
purchase
 
07:53:12.388 --> 07:53:12.398 align:start position:0%
and we all have clicked those little
 
07:53:14.708 --> 07:53:14.718 align:start position:0%
boxes when we set up a hotel reservation
 
07:53:16.548 --> 07:53:16.558 align:start position:0%
airline reservation whatever we click
 
07:53:18.708 --> 07:53:18.718 align:start position:0%
the box that says i've read the policies
 
07:53:20.548 --> 07:53:20.558 align:start position:0%
and i understand and those are things
 
07:53:21.670 --> 07:53:21.680 align:start position:0%
that tell you that you know you have to
 
07:53:23.670 --> 07:53:23.680 align:start position:0%
cancel more than 24 hours in advance or
 
07:53:25.670 --> 07:53:25.680 align:start position:0%
that the airline reservation cannot be
 
07:53:27.110 --> 07:53:27.120 align:start position:0%
altered and so on
 
07:53:28.868 --> 07:53:28.878 align:start position:0%
so this means it's stronger than just
 
07:53:30.230 --> 07:53:30.240 align:start position:0%
that they have something on their
 
07:53:33.270 --> 07:53:33.280 align:start position:0%
website but that the the patron has
 
07:53:36.310 --> 07:53:36.320 align:start position:0%
actually acknowledged that they saw that
 
07:53:38.708 --> 07:53:38.718 align:start position:0%
so it it tries to respect
 
07:53:38.718 --> 07:53:39.670 align:start position:0%
so it it tries to respect
the

07:53:39.670 --> 07:53:39.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:53:41.110 --> 07:53:41.120 align:start position:0%
right of the venue to set their own
 
07:53:43.510 --> 07:53:43.520 align:start position:0%
rules respects the right of the patron
 
07:53:46.628 --> 07:53:46.638 align:start position:0%
to demand a refund if the rules change
 
07:53:48.868 --> 07:53:48.878 align:start position:0%
but still respects the venue that if the
 
07:53:51.670 --> 07:53:51.680 align:start position:0%
patron is aware that it might change uh
 
07:53:53.750 --> 07:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
and they that and they've agreed to that
 
07:53:54.948 --> 07:53:54.958 align:start position:0%
that then they don't have to have the
 
07:53:57.270 --> 07:53:57.280 align:start position:0%
refund so it kind of kind of tries to
 
07:53:58.948 --> 07:53:58.958 align:start position:0%
thread that needle for all those various
 
07:53:58.958 --> 07:54:02.548 align:start position:0%
thread that needle for all those various
things

07:54:02.548 --> 07:54:02.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:54:05.990 --> 07:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:54:11.830 --> 07:54:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:54:14.788 --> 07:54:14.798 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i i just recall
 
07:54:17.030 --> 07:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
when we had the hearing on this
 
07:54:17.040 --> 07:54:18.150 align:start position:0%
when we had the hearing on this
and

07:54:18.150 --> 07:54:18.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:54:18.160 --> 07:54:19.110 align:start position:0%
and
uh

07:54:19.110 --> 07:54:19.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:54:21.750 --> 07:54:21.760 align:start position:0%
i just think this is well-meaning
 
07:54:24.708 --> 07:54:24.718 align:start position:0%
but they are this already exists
 
07:54:26.948 --> 07:54:26.958 align:start position:0%
and then i think what really got me was
 
07:54:29.110 --> 07:54:29.120 align:start position:0%
one of the people who testified said
 
07:54:31.510 --> 07:54:31.520 align:start position:0%
that it would be the big bad government
 
07:54:34.230 --> 07:54:34.240 align:start position:0%
putting teeth into it which means that
 
07:54:36.628 --> 07:54:36.638 align:start position:0%
they can sort of you know hold us up and
 
07:54:38.310 --> 07:54:38.320 align:start position:0%
say see the government said we have to
 
07:54:40.150 --> 07:54:40.160 align:start position:0%
do this and i'm i'm just sort of
 
07:54:44.708 --> 07:54:44.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:54:47.190 --> 07:54:47.200 align:start position:0%
if this if the power already exists for
 
07:54:49.590 --> 07:54:49.600 align:start position:0%
the venues to do what they're going to
 
07:54:51.030 --> 07:54:51.040 align:start position:0%
do announce whatever they're going to
 
07:54:52.788 --> 07:54:52.798 align:start position:0%
announce put it on their websites give
 
07:54:54.388 --> 07:54:54.398 align:start position:0%
them the options of this that or the
 
07:54:57.830 --> 07:54:57.840 align:start position:0%
other i just find this unnecessary
 
07:54:59.750 --> 07:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
may i respond representative connect to
 
07:55:01.910 --> 07:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
respond yes representative weber it
 
07:55:03.430 --> 07:55:03.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't tell them that they have to do
 
07:55:06.948 --> 07:55:06.958 align:start position:0%
that at all it gives the business the
 
07:55:09.990 --> 07:55:10.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity to set their own policies
 
07:55:12.868 --> 07:55:12.878 align:start position:0%
and it does clarify in statute that they
 
07:55:14.708 --> 07:55:14.718 align:start position:0%
have that authority to set their own
 
07:55:16.468 --> 07:55:16.478 align:start position:0%
policies since we've seen a number of
 
07:55:18.868 --> 07:55:18.878 align:start position:0%
bills trying to restrict their ability
 
07:55:21.430 --> 07:55:21.440 align:start position:0%
to set their own policies during this
 
07:55:24.388 --> 07:55:24.398 align:start position:0%
very legislative session as a result
 
07:55:26.150 --> 07:55:26.160 align:start position:0%
this will allow them to have that carve
 
07:55:27.750 --> 07:55:27.760 align:start position:0%
out so that they do still have that
 
07:55:27.760 --> 07:55:29.830 align:start position:0%
out so that they do still have that
authority

07:55:29.830 --> 07:55:29.840 align:start position:0%
authority
 
07:55:31.750 --> 07:55:31.760 align:start position:0%
and representative weber
 
07:55:34.468 --> 07:55:34.478 align:start position:0%
thank you and i think the other
 
07:55:37.510 --> 07:55:37.520 align:start position:0%
issue that the venue's brought up
 
07:55:40.230 --> 07:55:40.240 align:start position:0%
is they can currently say this is my
 
07:55:40.240 --> 07:55:41.830 align:start position:0%
is they can currently say this is my
policy

07:55:41.830 --> 07:55:41.840 align:start position:0%
policy
 
07:55:44.708 --> 07:55:44.718 align:start position:0%
but if a patron shows up and says i'm
 
07:55:47.670 --> 07:55:47.680 align:start position:0%
not going to comply with your policy
 
07:55:50.708 --> 07:55:50.718 align:start position:0%
they have no recourse
 
07:55:54.310 --> 07:55:54.320 align:start position:0%
to enforce their policy and all the
 
07:55:56.150 --> 07:55:56.160 align:start position:0%
people who signed up because they were
 
07:55:58.708 --> 07:55:58.718 align:start position:0%
relying on the policy
 
07:56:00.948 --> 07:56:00.958 align:start position:0%
then are stuck dealing with somebody who
 
07:56:03.830 --> 07:56:03.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't buy into that and the other
 
07:56:06.708 --> 07:56:06.718 align:start position:0%
thing that i heard very clearly from the
 
07:56:10.070 --> 07:56:10.080 align:start position:0%
venues is that often these policies
 
07:56:12.788 --> 07:56:12.798 align:start position:0%
these restrictions do not
 
07:56:15.110 --> 07:56:15.120 align:start position:0%
originate from the big bad government
 
07:56:17.670 --> 07:56:17.680 align:start position:0%
they originate from the performers or
 
07:56:20.230 --> 07:56:20.240 align:start position:0%
the act that they are booking
 
07:56:23.190 --> 07:56:23.200 align:start position:0%
and those people will not come to new
 
07:56:23.200 --> 07:56:25.430 align:start position:0%
and those people will not come to new
hampshire

07:56:25.430 --> 07:56:25.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
07:56:27.430 --> 07:56:27.440 align:start position:0%
if they can't
 
07:56:30.868 --> 07:56:30.878 align:start position:0%
set their terms and have their terms be
 
07:56:32.310 --> 07:56:32.320 align:start position:0%
complied with
 
07:56:34.948 --> 07:56:34.958 align:start position:0%
and we're a very small state so they can
 
07:56:37.670 --> 07:56:37.680 align:start position:0%
book places in maine or vermont or
 
07:56:39.750 --> 07:56:39.760 align:start position:0%
massachusetts and new hampshire people
 
07:56:41.270 --> 07:56:41.280 align:start position:0%
will go there
 
07:56:45.270 --> 07:56:45.280 align:start position:0%
and our performing arts venues and all
 
07:56:47.830 --> 07:56:47.840 align:start position:0%
of the people around them who provide
 
07:56:50.230 --> 07:56:50.240 align:start position:0%
meals and transport and other things
 
07:56:52.468 --> 07:56:52.478 align:start position:0%
that relate to the poor performing arts
 
07:56:52.478 --> 07:56:53.590 align:start position:0%
that relate to the poor performing arts
venues

07:56:53.590 --> 07:56:53.600 align:start position:0%
venues
 
07:56:56.150 --> 07:56:56.160 align:start position:0%
will suffer because those people will
 
07:56:58.548 --> 07:56:58.558 align:start position:0%
simply choose not to come here
 
07:57:01.350 --> 07:57:01.360 align:start position:0%
which is why i think we need this it's
 
07:57:03.750 --> 07:57:03.760 align:start position:0%
not so much what the government will do
 
07:57:06.628 --> 07:57:06.638 align:start position:0%
it's what the performers who are being
 
07:57:08.788 --> 07:57:08.798 align:start position:0%
booked here want to see
 
07:57:11.510 --> 07:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
and what the audiences want to see
 
07:57:13.110 --> 07:57:13.120 align:start position:0%
and the
 
07:57:17.910 --> 07:57:17.920 align:start position:0%
venues are going to set their policies
 
07:57:19.350 --> 07:57:19.360 align:start position:0%
based on
 
07:57:22.310 --> 07:57:22.320 align:start position:0%
the acts that they think they want to
 
07:57:25.430 --> 07:57:25.440 align:start position:0%
book and the people who are willing to
 
07:57:27.990 --> 07:57:28.000 align:start position:0%
pay for tickets if people don't agree
 
07:57:30.070 --> 07:57:30.080 align:start position:0%
with the policies they won't come and
 
07:57:32.868 --> 07:57:32.878 align:start position:0%
the venues will change their policies
 
07:57:35.830 --> 07:57:35.840 align:start position:0%
that's free market and it appears to me
 
07:57:37.590 --> 07:57:37.600 align:start position:0%
that this cuts right across the
 
07:57:41.030 --> 07:57:41.040 align:start position:0%
ideological and cultural perspective
 
07:57:45.750 --> 07:57:45.760 align:start position:0%
one performing group may insist on masks
 
07:57:48.548 --> 07:57:48.558 align:start position:0%
and maybe even personal protection suits
 
07:57:50.310 --> 07:57:50.320 align:start position:0%
all around
 
07:57:53.270 --> 07:57:53.280 align:start position:0%
the next group is bubba's jug band and
 
07:57:55.030 --> 07:57:55.040 align:start position:0%
hell no
 
07:58:00.628 --> 07:58:00.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:58:02.548 --> 07:58:02.558 align:start position:0%
representative leon
 
07:58:04.388 --> 07:58:04.398 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
07:58:06.468 --> 07:58:06.478 align:start position:0%
we had some good up close experience
 
07:58:08.230 --> 07:58:08.240 align:start position:0%
with this in derry because we had a
 
07:58:09.910 --> 07:58:09.920 align:start position:0%
facility that changed their their
 
07:58:12.948 --> 07:58:12.958 align:start position:0%
policies and watching what happened with
 
07:58:14.868 --> 07:58:14.878 align:start position:0%
the different constituents the attorney
 
07:58:17.750 --> 07:58:17.760 align:start position:0%
general did a very good job of
 
07:58:19.510 --> 07:58:19.520 align:start position:0%
first start making sure that money
 
07:58:21.110 --> 07:58:21.120 align:start position:0%
people's money would be refunded when
 
07:58:23.750 --> 07:58:23.760 align:start position:0%
there was no policy and then holding it
 
07:58:25.990 --> 07:58:26.000 align:start position:0%
to the policy that was in play
 
07:58:27.430 --> 07:58:27.440 align:start position:0%
watching this play out right in my
 
07:58:29.350 --> 07:58:29.360 align:start position:0%
backyard let me see that right now we're
 
07:58:31.030 --> 07:58:31.040 align:start position:0%
handling this well
 
07:58:32.948 --> 07:58:32.958 align:start position:0%
right now they are able to set their own
 
07:58:35.510 --> 07:58:35.520 align:start position:0%
policies right now they are denying
 
07:58:37.350 --> 07:58:37.360 align:start position:0%
access to people who are not following
 
07:58:38.628 --> 07:58:38.638 align:start position:0%
their policies
 
07:58:40.868 --> 07:58:40.878 align:start position:0%
we have trespass if you're not allowed
 
07:58:42.070 --> 07:58:42.080 align:start position:0%
on the property you're not allowed on
 
07:58:44.388 --> 07:58:44.398 align:start position:0%
the property um and they do have the
 
07:58:46.708 --> 07:58:46.718 align:start position:0%
right to do that as private businesses
 
07:58:49.270 --> 07:58:49.280 align:start position:0%
so i i see this as
 
07:58:51.910 --> 07:58:51.920 align:start position:0%
possibly setting up dueling legislation
 
07:58:51.920 --> 07:58:52.868 align:start position:0%
possibly setting up dueling legislation
and

07:58:52.868 --> 07:58:52.878 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:58:54.868 --> 07:58:54.878 align:start position:0%
if we have because it seems like one of
 
07:58:57.670 --> 07:58:57.680 align:start position:0%
the reasons for this is as a blocking
 
07:59:00.468 --> 07:59:00.478 align:start position:0%
move against large against anything that
 
07:59:03.510 --> 07:59:03.520 align:start position:0%
is prohibiting people from um
 
07:59:05.750 --> 07:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
that would prohibit this type of action
 
07:59:07.110 --> 07:59:07.120 align:start position:0%
if we don't think that that sort of
 
07:59:08.468 --> 07:59:08.478 align:start position:0%
thing is going to pass or come towards
 
07:59:10.070 --> 07:59:10.080 align:start position:0%
us i don't understand why we would need
 
07:59:11.910 --> 07:59:11.920 align:start position:0%
this and if we believe that that has a
 
07:59:14.150 --> 07:59:14.160 align:start position:0%
strong chance to pass then i'm not sure
 
07:59:15.430 --> 07:59:15.440 align:start position:0%
why we'd want to have conflicting
 
07:59:17.910 --> 07:59:17.920 align:start position:0%
legislation so while i appreciate the
 
07:59:20.548 --> 07:59:20.558 align:start position:0%
effort to get an amendment that that
 
07:59:22.948 --> 07:59:22.958 align:start position:0%
better reflects that that contract which
 
07:59:26.788 --> 07:59:26.798 align:start position:0%
is very important um i i just
 
07:59:28.548 --> 07:59:28.558 align:start position:0%
just in general i think that this is
 
07:59:29.910 --> 07:59:29.920 align:start position:0%
something that's already well handled
 
07:59:32.788 --> 07:59:32.798 align:start position:0%
without without legislation
 
07:59:37.750 --> 07:59:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:59:39.750 --> 07:59:39.760 align:start position:0%
but a number of the venues who came said
 
07:59:41.430 --> 07:59:41.440 align:start position:0%
it wasn't so
 
07:59:43.270 --> 07:59:43.280 align:start position:0%
maybe it was handled well in one case
 
07:59:45.510 --> 07:59:45.520 align:start position:0%
but it isn't working for everybody which
 
07:59:49.190 --> 07:59:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:59:52.868 --> 07:59:52.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:59:54.708 --> 07:59:54.718 align:start position:0%
representative cushman
 
07:59:56.788 --> 07:59:56.798 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
07:59:59.350 --> 07:59:59.360 align:start position:0%
um i will definitely echo what
 
08:00:01.590 --> 08:00:01.600 align:start position:0%
representative leon said this is totally
 
08:00:03.350 --> 08:00:03.360 align:start position:0%
unnecessary they can already do this
 
08:00:04.948 --> 08:00:04.958 align:start position:0%
it's just a way of them kind of being
 
08:00:04.958 --> 08:00:06.070 align:start position:0%
it's just a way of them kind of being
like

08:00:06.070 --> 08:00:06.080 align:start position:0%
like
 
08:00:09.030 --> 08:00:09.040 align:start position:0%
oh well the state says that we have to
 
08:00:11.030 --> 08:00:11.040 align:start position:0%
because that was mentioned you know that
 
08:00:13.590 --> 08:00:13.600 align:start position:0%
they can point to it and and act like
 
08:00:15.590 --> 08:00:15.600 align:start position:0%
they're not responsible but the
 
08:00:17.350 --> 08:00:17.360 align:start position:0%
legislature is
 
08:00:17.360 --> 08:00:18.788 align:start position:0%
legislature is
and

08:00:18.788 --> 08:00:18.798 align:start position:0%
and
 
08:00:20.388 --> 08:00:20.398 align:start position:0%
the other thing is i just have a
 
08:00:22.310 --> 08:00:22.320 align:start position:0%
question i wonder if anybody knows the
 
08:00:24.468 --> 08:00:24.478 align:start position:0%
answer do these
 
08:00:26.868 --> 08:00:26.878 align:start position:0%
performing arts venues accept any form
 
08:00:28.948 --> 08:00:28.958 align:start position:0%
of state funding
 
08:00:31.190 --> 08:00:31.200 align:start position:0%
in the form of grants or
 
08:00:34.548 --> 08:00:34.558 align:start position:0%
contracts or anything like that
 
08:00:36.948 --> 08:00:36.958 align:start position:0%
representative canarch
 
08:00:39.190 --> 08:00:39.200 align:start position:0%
that i'm not certain of though there was
 
08:00:41.590 --> 08:00:41.600 align:start position:0%
some funding that did come to help bail
 
08:00:43.430 --> 08:00:43.440 align:start position:0%
them out when they were in financial
 
08:00:45.510 --> 08:00:45.520 align:start position:0%
difficulty due to this the goal of this
 
08:00:47.590 --> 08:00:47.600 align:start position:0%
bill was actually to
 
08:00:49.350 --> 08:00:49.360 align:start position:0%
not need to do that so much because it
 
08:00:50.628 --> 08:00:50.638 align:start position:0%
would allow them to stay open and
 
08:00:53.430 --> 08:00:53.440 align:start position:0%
function but i'm also still troubled by
 
08:00:54.948 --> 08:00:54.958 align:start position:0%
people continue saying that the state
 
08:00:57.750 --> 08:00:57.760 align:start position:0%
says you have to it does not say that
 
08:01:01.750 --> 08:01:01.760 align:start position:0%
if you look at the line on line 14.
 
08:01:04.628 --> 08:01:04.638 align:start position:0%
venues located in new hampshire shall
 
08:01:06.948 --> 08:01:06.958 align:start position:0%
have the authority to establish in other
 
08:01:09.430 --> 08:01:09.440 align:start position:0%
words it's not that the state says this
 
08:01:11.830 --> 08:01:11.840 align:start position:0%
is what you have to do it establishes
 
08:01:14.310 --> 08:01:14.320 align:start position:0%
that they have the authority to set
 
08:01:15.510 --> 08:01:15.520 align:start position:0%
their own
 
08:01:17.590 --> 08:01:17.600 align:start position:0%
business policies
 
08:01:19.350 --> 08:01:19.360 align:start position:0%
and that is a perfectly fine thing i
 
08:01:19.360 --> 08:01:20.230 align:start position:0%
and that is a perfectly fine thing i
don't

08:01:20.230 --> 08:01:20.240 align:start position:0%
don't
 
08:01:21.670 --> 08:01:21.680 align:start position:0%
think there's a problem
 
08:01:25.990 --> 08:01:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
08:01:27.910 --> 08:01:27.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
08:01:29.830 --> 08:01:29.840 align:start position:0%
in regards to the
 
08:01:29.840 --> 08:01:31.030 align:start position:0%
in regards to the
amendment

08:01:31.030 --> 08:01:31.040 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
08:01:32.708 --> 08:01:32.718 align:start position:0%
one of the things that is clear and i
 
08:01:32.718 --> 08:01:33.590 align:start position:0%
one of the things that is clear and i
think

08:01:33.590 --> 08:01:33.600 align:start position:0%
think
 
08:01:35.990 --> 08:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
our constituents deserve to have that
 
08:01:37.590 --> 08:01:37.600 align:start position:0%
kind of protection
 
08:01:39.670 --> 08:01:39.680 align:start position:0%
is how they handle refund
 
08:01:41.430 --> 08:01:41.440 align:start position:0%
because right now we're leaving it up to
 
08:01:44.388 --> 08:01:44.398 align:start position:0%
the individual facility
 
08:01:46.468 --> 08:01:46.478 align:start position:0%
how to handle a refund
 
08:01:47.990 --> 08:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
so therefore
 
08:01:51.910 --> 08:01:51.920 align:start position:0%
by statute it clearly tells the patron
 
08:01:54.230 --> 08:01:54.240 align:start position:0%
what they're
 
08:01:56.788 --> 08:01:56.798 align:start position:0%
able to do as far as how to get a refund
 
08:01:59.830 --> 08:01:59.840 align:start position:0%
if we rely upon the facility
 
08:02:02.388 --> 08:02:02.398 align:start position:0%
to make that dictate then we'll
 
08:02:02.398 --> 08:02:03.510 align:start position:0%
to make that dictate then we'll
basically

08:02:03.510 --> 08:02:03.520 align:start position:0%
basically
 
08:02:05.190 --> 08:02:05.200 align:start position:0%
not giving our constituents the
 
08:02:07.670 --> 08:02:07.680 align:start position:0%
protection of being a patron to getting
 
08:02:10.388 --> 08:02:10.398 align:start position:0%
a refund they really deserve because
 
08:02:12.628 --> 08:02:12.638 align:start position:0%
businesses basically can wiggle around
 
08:02:14.548 --> 08:02:14.558 align:start position:0%
the policy i don't think that's our
 
08:02:15.750 --> 08:02:15.760 align:start position:0%
intent we want to be sure that they're
 
08:02:20.388 --> 08:02:20.398 align:start position:0%
 
08:02:22.150 --> 08:02:22.160 align:start position:0%
representative gay
 
08:02:23.510 --> 08:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
i agree
 
08:02:25.110 --> 08:02:25.120 align:start position:0%
i think that uh
 
08:02:27.670 --> 08:02:27.680 align:start position:0%
we already have the policy where the
 
08:02:29.510 --> 08:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
venue can
 
08:02:29.520 --> 08:02:30.468 align:start position:0%
venue can
uh

08:02:30.468 --> 08:02:30.478 align:start position:0%
uh
 
08:02:32.868 --> 08:02:32.878 align:start position:0%
can notify people they seem to be doing
 
08:02:35.670 --> 08:02:35.680 align:start position:0%
that now but
 
08:02:37.750 --> 08:02:37.760 align:start position:0%
prying money out of some people's hands
 
08:02:39.270 --> 08:02:39.280 align:start position:0%
is really hard
 
08:02:40.868 --> 08:02:40.878 align:start position:0%
so it seems like this this is a
 
08:02:43.270 --> 08:02:43.280 align:start position:0%
guarantee for the purchaser of the
 
08:02:43.280 --> 08:02:44.628 align:start position:0%
guarantee for the purchaser of the
tickets

08:02:44.628 --> 08:02:44.638 align:start position:0%
tickets
 
08:02:46.548 --> 08:02:46.558 align:start position:0%
representative folsom
 
08:02:49.430 --> 08:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
08:02:51.830 --> 08:02:51.840 align:start position:0%
it's late in the afternoon and and i
 
08:02:54.948 --> 08:02:54.958 align:start position:0%
need coffee really badly um
 
08:02:57.830 --> 08:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
and so i'm having i i
 
08:03:00.310 --> 08:03:00.320 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to go back to english grammar
 
08:03:02.310 --> 08:03:02.320 align:start position:0%
class which just makes it even that much
 
08:03:02.320 --> 08:03:03.510 align:start position:0%
class which just makes it even that much
worse

08:03:03.510 --> 08:03:03.520 align:start position:0%
worse
 
08:03:03.520 --> 08:03:04.388 align:start position:0%
worse
um

08:03:04.388 --> 08:03:04.398 align:start position:0%
um
 
08:03:06.708 --> 08:03:06.718 align:start position:0%
i'm reading this sentence and it says if
 
08:03:09.430 --> 08:03:09.440 align:start position:0%
policies posted at the time of purchase
 
08:03:12.310 --> 08:03:12.320 align:start position:0%
relative to the blah blah blah
 
08:03:14.628 --> 08:03:14.638 align:start position:0%
change after the ticket purchase is
 
08:03:16.948 --> 08:03:16.958 align:start position:0%
completed the venue shall refund the
 
08:03:20.388 --> 08:03:20.398 align:start position:0%
ticket price of the patrons request
 
08:03:20.398 --> 08:03:21.750 align:start position:0%
ticket price of the patrons request
unless

08:03:21.750 --> 08:03:21.760 align:start position:0%
unless
 
08:03:24.708 --> 08:03:24.718 align:start position:0%
the patron acknowledged that all orders
 
08:03:27.110 --> 08:03:27.120 align:start position:0%
are subject to venue policies at the
 
08:03:30.150 --> 08:03:30.160 align:start position:0%
time of show which may be different than
 
08:03:34.150 --> 08:03:34.160 align:start position:0%
the policies at the time of purchase
 
08:03:37.430 --> 08:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
so to me it's like saying
 
08:03:37.440 --> 08:03:38.628 align:start position:0%
so to me it's like saying
um

08:03:38.628 --> 08:03:38.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
08:03:39.910 --> 08:03:39.920 align:start position:0%
unless the
 
08:03:42.230 --> 08:03:42.240 align:start position:0%
patron knew that there could possibly be
 
08:03:44.948 --> 08:03:44.958 align:start position:0%
a change in the policies you're out of
 
08:03:44.958 --> 08:03:46.468 align:start position:0%
a change in the policies you're out of
luck

08:03:46.468 --> 08:03:46.478 align:start position:0%
luck
 
08:03:49.590 --> 08:03:49.600 align:start position:0%
i mean that's kind of how it can yeah if
 
08:03:52.230 --> 08:03:52.240 align:start position:0%
you couldn't explain that representative
 
08:03:54.070 --> 08:03:54.080 align:start position:0%
yes and i i really thank representative
 
08:03:55.430 --> 08:03:55.440 align:start position:0%
merchant for saying this better than i
 
08:03:57.350 --> 08:03:57.360 align:start position:0%
said earlier yeah that's the whole thing
 
08:03:59.910 --> 08:03:59.920 align:start position:0%
it protects them because it says
 
08:04:02.310 --> 08:04:02.320 align:start position:0%
if you if the patron has not been
 
08:04:04.468 --> 08:04:04.478 align:start position:0%
notified that things could change
 
08:04:06.548 --> 08:04:06.558 align:start position:0%
they have the right of a refund
 
08:04:09.030 --> 08:04:09.040 align:start position:0%
if the patron has been notified and not
 
08:04:10.230 --> 08:04:10.240 align:start position:0%
just notified in fact that was the
 
08:04:12.388 --> 08:04:12.398 align:start position:0%
choice for maddie matt wilhelm wanted
 
08:04:13.910 --> 08:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
representative wilhelm wanted to just be
 
08:04:15.510 --> 08:04:15.520 align:start position:0%
notified i said no needs to be
 
08:04:18.468 --> 08:04:18.478 align:start position:0%
acknowledged if the if the patron has
 
08:04:20.628 --> 08:04:20.638 align:start position:0%
acknowledged that they were informed
 
08:04:22.310 --> 08:04:22.320 align:start position:0%
that it could change
 
08:04:23.990 --> 08:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
then they do not have that right so
 
08:04:25.510 --> 08:04:25.520 align:start position:0%
therefore it protects
 
08:04:30.388 --> 08:04:30.398 align:start position:0%
 
08:04:32.548 --> 08:04:32.558 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to clarify the question you
 
08:04:32.558 --> 08:04:33.430 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to clarify the question you
ask

08:04:33.430 --> 08:04:33.440 align:start position:0%
ask
 
08:04:34.628 --> 08:04:34.638 align:start position:0%
so it it
 
08:04:36.548 --> 08:04:36.558 align:start position:0%
what it does is it clarify it protects
 
08:04:38.150 --> 08:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
the patron
 
08:04:40.150 --> 08:04:40.160 align:start position:0%
so that they have that right if they
 
08:04:41.590 --> 08:04:41.600 align:start position:0%
were not
 
08:04:43.190 --> 08:04:43.200 align:start position:0%
like if they did not acknowledge that it
 
08:04:45.670 --> 08:04:45.680 align:start position:0%
could change it protects the venue to be
 
08:04:47.670 --> 08:04:47.680 align:start position:0%
able to get that uh
 
08:04:49.350 --> 08:04:49.360 align:start position:0%
to not have to get that refund if they
 
08:04:51.190 --> 08:04:51.200 align:start position:0%
did tell them
 
08:04:52.708 --> 08:04:52.718 align:start position:0%
so it protects both that's what i was
 
08:04:55.830 --> 08:04:55.840 align:start position:0%
trying to achieve
 
08:04:59.430 --> 08:04:59.440 align:start position:0%
representative soloway uh mr chairman
 
08:05:01.750 --> 08:05:01.760 align:start position:0%
without meaning to go out of order i
 
08:05:05.030 --> 08:05:05.040 align:start position:0%
have checked and it seems that the late
 
08:05:08.628 --> 08:05:08.638 align:start position:0%
february monsoon has begun
 
08:05:10.868 --> 08:05:10.878 align:start position:0%
east and south of us
 
08:05:14.468 --> 08:05:14.478 align:start position:0%
and the february blizzard is beginning
 
08:05:16.948 --> 08:05:16.958 align:start position:0%
west and north of us and i'd like to
 
08:05:20.708 --> 08:05:20.718 align:start position:0%
know if the chair does not exercise due
 
08:05:23.110 --> 08:05:23.120 align:start position:0%
diligence guarding the safety of the
 
08:05:26.310 --> 08:05:26.320 align:start position:0%
members of this committee is he liable
 
08:05:28.548 --> 08:05:28.558 align:start position:0%
for suit no since you described
 
08:05:30.628 --> 08:05:30.638 align:start position:0%
directions everywhere but right here
 
08:05:32.708 --> 08:05:32.718 align:start position:0%
we're in good shape let's wrap this up
 
08:05:34.708 --> 08:05:34.718 align:start position:0%
it isn't rocket science can we move on
 
08:05:36.868 --> 08:05:36.878 align:start position:0%
to a vote representative pearson thank
 
08:05:39.350 --> 08:05:39.360 align:start position:0%
you i just i'm looking at this and
 
08:05:40.788 --> 08:05:40.798 align:start position:0%
from the outside and as a guy who's
 
08:05:42.070 --> 08:05:42.080 align:start position:0%
gonna have to vote on this on the full
 
08:05:42.080 --> 08:05:42.948 align:start position:0%
gonna have to vote on this on the full
floor

08:05:42.948 --> 08:05:42.958 align:start position:0%
floor
 
08:05:45.190 --> 08:05:45.200 align:start position:0%
this is this is what i'm asking looking
 
08:05:46.310 --> 08:05:46.320 align:start position:0%
at this here you're talking about
 
08:05:48.310 --> 08:05:48.320 align:start position:0%
communicable diseases
 
08:05:50.788 --> 08:05:50.798 align:start position:0%
this and i i'm asking to make sure that
 
08:05:53.190 --> 08:05:53.200 align:start position:0%
we have this right if this if i'm
 
08:05:55.430 --> 08:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
reading this correctly the venue has the
 
08:05:55.440 --> 08:05:58.948 align:start position:0%
reading this correctly the venue has the
authority

08:05:58.948 --> 08:05:58.958 align:start position:0%
 
08:05:58.958 --> 08:05:59.990 align:start position:0%
 
to

08:05:59.990 --> 08:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
08:06:03.750 --> 08:06:03.760 align:start position:0%
require to have testing requirements
 
08:06:06.388 --> 08:06:06.398 align:start position:0%
for patrons to enter for a communicable
 
08:06:06.398 --> 08:06:08.150 align:start position:0%
for patrons to enter for a communicable
disease

08:06:08.150 --> 08:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
disease
 
08:06:13.350 --> 08:06:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
08:06:15.270 --> 08:06:15.280 align:start position:0%
yes i mean the point is we
 
08:06:16.788 --> 08:06:16.798 align:start position:0%
one of the things we've tried to do over
 
08:06:19.590 --> 08:06:19.600 align:start position:0%
the last couple of last month or so is
 
08:06:19.600 --> 08:06:20.388 align:start position:0%
the last couple of last month or so is
not

08:06:20.388 --> 08:06:20.398 align:start position:0%
not
 
08:06:22.708 --> 08:06:22.718 align:start position:0%
take away some the specificity of covet
 
08:06:25.430 --> 08:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
19 references because that may not still
 
08:06:27.910 --> 08:06:27.920 align:start position:0%
be there and likewise some of these
 
08:06:29.910 --> 08:06:29.920 align:start position:0%
things might be more applicable to other
 
08:06:31.910 --> 08:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
diseases that may be present i think it
 
08:06:33.510 --> 08:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
would be prudent to look at the list of
 
08:06:35.110 --> 08:06:35.120 align:start position:0%
communicable diseases in the state of
 
08:06:36.388 --> 08:06:36.398 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
08:06:38.708 --> 08:06:38.718 align:start position:0%
and what you're opening your self up to
 
08:06:41.110 --> 08:06:41.120 align:start position:0%
for a venue to have the authority to ask
 
08:06:42.468 --> 08:06:42.478 align:start position:0%
for here
 
08:06:43.910 --> 08:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
well one of the things i think that's
 
08:06:46.150 --> 08:06:46.160 align:start position:0%
important again this is the free market
 
08:06:47.750 --> 08:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
issue and i think representative weber
 
08:06:48.708 --> 08:06:48.718 align:start position:0%
said this
 
08:06:51.510 --> 08:06:51.520 align:start position:0%
if some venue is being totally bizarre
 
08:06:53.030 --> 08:06:53.040 align:start position:0%
in their policies
 
08:06:54.788 --> 08:06:54.798 align:start position:0%
no one will go there they will go to the
 
08:06:57.350 --> 08:06:57.360 align:start position:0%
other venue that actually has it i don't
 
08:06:59.110 --> 08:06:59.120 align:start position:0%
think this is anything nefarious by
 
08:07:01.190 --> 08:07:01.200 align:start position:0%
communicable diseases there's not we
 
08:07:02.468 --> 08:07:02.478 align:start position:0%
don't have a specific list of
 
08:07:05.510 --> 08:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
communicable diseases in the state
 
08:07:07.510 --> 08:07:07.520 align:start position:0%
well okay but i mean we're we're looking
 
08:07:10.548 --> 08:07:10.558 align:start position:0%
at things like meningitis uh chicken pox
 
08:07:12.150 --> 08:07:12.160 align:start position:0%
versus all those things let's say you
 
08:07:14.468 --> 08:07:14.478 align:start position:0%
had a measles outbreak that was really
 
08:07:16.628 --> 08:07:16.638 align:start position:0%
quite severe in an area and they they
 
08:07:18.468 --> 08:07:18.478 align:start position:0%
wanted to be able to do something now
 
08:07:20.868 --> 08:07:20.878 align:start position:0%
testing is not something we do there but
 
08:07:23.190 --> 08:07:23.200 align:start position:0%
that would allow that but this is this
 
08:07:24.628 --> 08:07:24.638 align:start position:0%
is not really
 
08:07:26.548 --> 08:07:26.558 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure this is not as broad as
 
08:07:28.788 --> 08:07:28.798 align:start position:0%
you're making it out to be it could
 
08:07:31.030 --> 08:07:31.040 align:start position:0%
apply but it's i don't think a venue is
 
08:07:32.708 --> 08:07:32.718 align:start position:0%
going to start doing unreasonable things
 
08:07:33.990 --> 08:07:34.000 align:start position:0%
they'll be out of business in no time
 
08:07:34.000 --> 08:07:35.190 align:start position:0%
they'll be out of business in no time
flat

08:07:35.190 --> 08:07:35.200 align:start position:0%
flat
 
08:07:37.590 --> 08:07:37.600 align:start position:0%
representative leon thank you mr
 
08:07:37.600 --> 08:07:39.110 align:start position:0%
representative leon thank you mr
chairman

08:07:39.110 --> 08:07:39.120 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
08:07:41.270 --> 08:07:41.280 align:start position:0%
this brings the question of will you
 
08:07:43.590 --> 08:07:43.600 align:start position:0%
have facilities that are advertising
 
08:07:45.990 --> 08:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
themselves as std free are they going to
 
08:07:47.830 --> 08:07:47.840 align:start position:0%
be testing people for stds before you
 
08:07:50.388 --> 08:07:50.398 align:start position:0%
come to the rave at whichever facility i
 
08:07:52.388 --> 08:07:52.398 align:start position:0%
think that i appreciate the attempt to
 
08:07:54.788 --> 08:07:54.798 align:start position:0%
move outside of covid but i i think the
 
08:07:56.948 --> 08:07:56.958 align:start position:0%
ticket policies are really the most
 
08:07:58.388 --> 08:07:58.398 align:start position:0%
important thing and that's just a pure
 
08:08:00.628 --> 08:08:00.638 align:start position:0%
commerce thing once we start talking
 
08:08:02.868 --> 08:08:02.878 align:start position:0%
about testing for communicable diseases
 
08:08:04.548 --> 08:08:04.558 align:start position:0%
are you denying access to people who are
 
08:08:08.070 --> 08:08:08.080 align:start position:0%
hiv positive what else are you doing
 
08:08:12.230 --> 08:08:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
08:08:14.548 --> 08:08:14.558 align:start position:0%
beyond the patron
 
08:08:15.910 --> 08:08:15.920 align:start position:0%
we're now going down the slope or
 
08:08:17.190 --> 08:08:17.200 align:start position:0%
telling a business how to run their
 
08:08:17.200 --> 08:08:18.230 align:start position:0%
telling a business how to run their
business

08:08:18.230 --> 08:08:18.240 align:start position:0%
business
 
08:08:19.510 --> 08:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
and i think i'm really having a
 
08:08:21.990 --> 08:08:22.000 align:start position:0%
difficult time to dictate to a business
 
08:08:23.910 --> 08:08:23.920 align:start position:0%
and say to them well you can run your
 
08:08:25.190 --> 08:08:25.200 align:start position:0%
business this way because with the
 
08:08:26.310 --> 08:08:26.320 align:start position:0%
government we're going to tell you how
 
08:08:27.670 --> 08:08:27.680 align:start position:0%
to run your business
 
08:08:28.788 --> 08:08:28.798 align:start position:0%
and i think
 
08:08:30.948 --> 08:08:30.958 align:start position:0%
it's a free market if the business wants
 
08:08:32.948 --> 08:08:32.958 align:start position:0%
to run the business that way
 
08:08:34.628 --> 08:08:34.638 align:start position:0%
and if patrons don't want to patronize
 
08:08:36.548 --> 08:08:36.558 align:start position:0%
it they won't be in business
 
08:08:38.388 --> 08:08:38.398 align:start position:0%
so therefore the free market is going to
 
08:08:40.150 --> 08:08:40.160 align:start position:0%
rule here not
 
08:08:41.830 --> 08:08:41.840 align:start position:0%
the government and i think we should be
 
08:08:44.150 --> 08:08:44.160 align:start position:0%
clear about this is the government is
 
08:08:46.468 --> 08:08:46.478 align:start position:0%
the issue here and we're basically
 
08:08:47.910 --> 08:08:47.920 align:start position:0%
telling the business you can run your
 
08:08:50.388 --> 08:08:50.398 align:start position:0%
business as you wish and we're not going
 
08:08:52.948 --> 08:08:52.958 align:start position:0%
to interfere with you
 
08:08:55.990 --> 08:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
representative nutter upham
 
08:08:56.000 --> 08:08:57.110 align:start position:0%
representative nutter upham
we're

08:08:57.110 --> 08:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
we're
 
08:08:59.350 --> 08:08:59.360 align:start position:0%
very good in this committee of coming up
 
08:08:59.360 --> 08:09:00.468 align:start position:0%
very good in this committee of coming up
with

08:09:00.468 --> 08:09:00.478 align:start position:0%
with
 
08:09:02.948 --> 08:09:02.958 align:start position:0%
way out there scenarios something that
 
08:09:04.388 --> 08:09:04.398 align:start position:0%
could happen
 
08:09:08.070 --> 08:09:08.080 align:start position:0%
and talk now this is my first time um
 
08:09:08.080 --> 08:09:09.270 align:start position:0%
and talk now this is my first time um
quoting

08:09:09.270 --> 08:09:09.280 align:start position:0%
quoting
 
08:09:09.280 --> 08:09:10.070 align:start position:0%
quoting
uh

08:09:10.070 --> 08:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
08:09:10.080 --> 08:09:11.030 align:start position:0%
uh
tim

08:09:11.030 --> 08:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
tim
 
08:09:13.110 --> 08:09:13.120 align:start position:0%
lang lane
 
08:09:14.548 --> 08:09:14.558 align:start position:0%
lang okay
 
08:09:17.910 --> 08:09:17.920 align:start position:0%
um so you know he said in his testimony
 
08:09:20.388 --> 08:09:20.398 align:start position:0%
and in a private conversation that he
 
08:09:22.548 --> 08:09:22.558 align:start position:0%
he works for
 
08:09:24.230 --> 08:09:24.240 align:start position:0%
concert venues
 
08:09:27.190 --> 08:09:27.200 align:start position:0%
he attended over 53 concerts this summer
 
08:09:28.548 --> 08:09:28.558 align:start position:0%
that he worked at
 
08:09:30.868 --> 08:09:30.878 align:start position:0%
and many of them required
 
08:09:33.270 --> 08:09:33.280 align:start position:0%
uh proof of vaccine or proof of negative
 
08:09:35.270 --> 08:09:35.280 align:start position:0%
and he said that they had a testing
 
08:09:38.070 --> 08:09:38.080 align:start position:0%
station you know 15 minute testing
 
08:09:39.750 --> 08:09:39.760 align:start position:0%
station and i think that's what we're
 
08:09:43.110 --> 08:09:43.120 align:start position:0%
talking about not testing for stds or
 
08:09:45.590 --> 08:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
or nasal congestion or
 
08:09:45.600 --> 08:09:46.388 align:start position:0%
or nasal congestion or
um

08:09:46.388 --> 08:09:46.398 align:start position:0%
um
 
08:09:46.398 --> 08:09:47.430 align:start position:0%
um
headaches

08:09:47.430 --> 08:09:47.440 align:start position:0%
headaches
 
08:09:50.868 --> 08:09:50.878 align:start position:0%
so i and this was a specific covid kind
 
08:09:52.150 --> 08:09:52.160 align:start position:0%
of thing so
 
08:09:52.160 --> 08:09:53.510 align:start position:0%
of thing so
i

08:09:53.510 --> 08:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
i
 
08:09:54.548 --> 08:09:54.558 align:start position:0%
think we should leave it at that
 
08:09:57.350 --> 08:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
representative cofoult
 
08:09:59.350 --> 08:09:59.360 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman so
 
08:10:01.350 --> 08:10:01.360 align:start position:0%
i i think uh representative merchant
 
08:10:02.868 --> 08:10:02.878 align:start position:0%
brought up the point that we don't want
 
08:10:05.270 --> 08:10:05.280 align:start position:0%
to tell businesses how to operate
 
08:10:06.948 --> 08:10:06.958 align:start position:0%
i would argue that we don't need a
 
08:10:09.030 --> 08:10:09.040 align:start position:0%
statute to tell businesses that we're
 
08:10:11.590 --> 08:10:11.600 align:start position:0%
not going to tell them how to operate
 
08:10:14.468 --> 08:10:14.478 align:start position:0%
um and and then the the other thing is
 
08:10:16.468 --> 08:10:16.478 align:start position:0%
although the the language here does say
 
08:10:18.388 --> 08:10:18.398 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding any other provision of
 
08:10:18.398 --> 08:10:19.430 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding any other provision of
law

08:10:19.430 --> 08:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
law
 
08:10:22.230 --> 08:10:22.240 align:start position:0%
i would point out that uh legislation
 
08:10:24.070 --> 08:10:24.080 align:start position:0%
passed last year
 
08:10:24.080 --> 08:10:25.350 align:start position:0%
passed last year
um

08:10:25.350 --> 08:10:25.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
08:10:29.430 --> 08:10:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
08:10:29.440 --> 08:10:30.020 align:start position:0%
 
any any

08:10:30.020 --> 08:10:30.030 align:start position:0%
any any
 
08:10:30.030 --> 08:10:31.270 align:start position:0%
any any
[Music]

08:10:31.270 --> 08:10:31.280 align:start position:0%

08:10:33.350 --> 08:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
subdivision of the state governmental
 
08:10:36.310 --> 08:10:36.320 align:start position:0%
entity quasi governmental entity
 
08:10:36.320 --> 08:10:38.628 align:start position:0%
entity quasi governmental entity
um

08:10:38.628 --> 08:10:38.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
08:10:41.270 --> 08:10:41.280 align:start position:0%
or any public benefit or or any
 
08:10:41.280 --> 08:10:42.468 align:start position:0%
or any public benefit or or any
organization

08:10:42.468 --> 08:10:42.478 align:start position:0%
organization
 
08:10:42.478 --> 08:10:45.030 align:start position:0%

essentially

08:10:45.030 --> 08:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
08:10:47.430 --> 08:10:47.440 align:start position:0%

08:10:49.350 --> 08:10:49.360 align:start position:0%
the state expense
 
08:10:52.310 --> 08:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
08:10:54.468 --> 08:10:54.478 align:start position:0%
needs to be not
 
08:10:56.388 --> 08:10:56.398 align:start position:0%
discriminating on based on vaccination
 
08:10:59.190 --> 08:10:59.200 align:start position:0%
status so i would have to revisit that
 
08:11:01.750 --> 08:11:01.760 align:start position:0%
but i do believe that given the
 
08:11:04.310 --> 08:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
performing arts
 
08:11:06.468 --> 08:11:06.478 align:start position:0%
grants that are available through the
 
08:11:06.478 --> 08:11:07.670 align:start position:0%
grants that are available through the
state

08:11:07.670 --> 08:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
state
 
08:11:10.070 --> 08:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
we we may be running afoul of that as
 
08:11:11.910 --> 08:11:11.920 align:start position:0%
well with this legislation
 
08:11:14.948 --> 08:11:14.958 align:start position:0%
representative kelsey
 
08:11:16.948 --> 08:11:16.958 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um i think we're
 
08:11:18.788 --> 08:11:18.798 align:start position:0%
just going to probably disagree on this
 
08:11:19.990 --> 08:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
but i i
 
08:11:22.230 --> 08:11:22.240 align:start position:0%
i don't see why we need this when
 
08:11:25.350 --> 08:11:25.360 align:start position:0%
private businesses are allowed to do
 
08:11:27.430 --> 08:11:27.440 align:start position:0%
um right now what and they are they're
 
08:11:29.670 --> 08:11:29.680 align:start position:0%
doing testing they're doing um proof of
 
08:11:31.270 --> 08:11:31.280 align:start position:0%
vaccination they're they're doing all
 
08:11:34.230 --> 08:11:34.240 align:start position:0%
these things and we heard in testimony
 
08:11:37.990 --> 08:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
um you know people talk about yes we are
 
08:11:40.150 --> 08:11:40.160 align:start position:0%
we're doing this but it it's not
 
08:11:40.160 --> 08:11:41.830 align:start position:0%
we're doing this but it it's not
enforceable

08:11:41.830 --> 08:11:41.840 align:start position:0%
enforceable
 
08:11:44.230 --> 08:11:44.240 align:start position:0%
um and so that they needed some type of
 
08:11:46.788 --> 08:11:46.798 align:start position:0%
legislation to enforce you know the mask
 
08:11:49.190 --> 08:11:49.200 align:start position:0%
wearing i'll use that as an example and
 
08:11:51.590 --> 08:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
we heard that but but they it is
 
08:11:54.708 --> 08:11:54.718 align:start position:0%
enforceable because it's their house so
 
08:11:57.350 --> 08:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
they can as it is now
 
08:12:00.868 --> 08:12:00.878 align:start position:0%
enforce that and so i just i don't know
 
08:12:00.878 --> 08:12:01.990 align:start position:0%
enforce that and so i just i don't know
that

08:12:01.990 --> 08:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
08:12:02.000 --> 08:12:02.788 align:start position:0%
that
that

08:12:02.788 --> 08:12:02.798 align:start position:0%
that
 
08:12:05.190 --> 08:12:05.200 align:start position:0%
making this a law is the right path
 
08:12:07.430 --> 08:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
forward and i i do want to say i don't
 
08:12:09.030 --> 08:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
think we're i mean
 
08:12:12.070 --> 08:12:12.080 align:start position:0%
this is covid specific and i know it i
 
08:12:14.948 --> 08:12:14.958 align:start position:0%
know it's been broadened but i don't
 
08:12:16.548 --> 08:12:16.558 align:start position:0%
think we're going to be dealing with
 
08:12:19.430 --> 08:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
this types of issues much longer anyway
 
08:12:21.430 --> 08:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
so i i i don't know i guess we're
 
08:12:23.270 --> 08:12:23.280 align:start position:0%
probably just gonna disagree on that
 
08:12:24.948 --> 08:12:24.958 align:start position:0%
representative i do not believe the
 
08:12:26.708 --> 08:12:26.718 align:start position:0%
wording of the amendment
 
08:12:28.708 --> 08:12:28.718 align:start position:0%
makes it covet specific would you point
 
08:12:31.030 --> 08:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
in the amendment where it does please
 
08:12:33.270 --> 08:12:33.280 align:start position:0%
it doesn't sir and i said this did
 
08:12:35.030 --> 08:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
broaden it so it is not code it's
 
08:12:36.548 --> 08:12:36.558 align:start position:0%
specific it's communicable disease and
 
08:12:38.868 --> 08:12:38.878 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry about that that's okay
 
08:12:42.310 --> 08:12:42.320 align:start position:0%
 
08:12:44.310 --> 08:12:44.320 align:start position:0%
i've already made the same point three
 
08:12:46.070 --> 08:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
times so i'm going to wave off and hope
 
08:12:49.510 --> 08:12:49.520 align:start position:0%
to god that gets us to a vote
 
08:12:54.070 --> 08:12:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
08:12:58.070 --> 08:12:58.080 align:start position:0%

08:13:02.788 --> 08:13:02.798 align:start position:0%

winter storms come in let's do an easy
 
08:17:58.558 --> 08:17:59.510 align:start position:0%
winter storms come in let's do an easy
one

08:17:59.510 --> 08:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
one
 
08:18:01.670 --> 08:18:01.680 align:start position:0%
all right here's the deal folks
 
08:18:04.230 --> 08:18:04.240 align:start position:0%
this will be done all of the bills we
 
08:18:05.670 --> 08:18:05.680 align:start position:0%
heard today
 
08:18:08.628 --> 08:18:08.638 align:start position:0%
all of the stack of bills that have not
 
08:18:12.868 --> 08:18:12.878 align:start position:0%
been exact yet will be done and if this
 
08:18:15.190 --> 08:18:15.200 align:start position:0%
means we have to book wednesday march
 
08:18:15.200 --> 08:18:16.548 align:start position:0%
means we have to book wednesday march
9th

08:18:16.548 --> 08:18:16.558 align:start position:0%
9th
 
08:18:17.830 --> 08:18:17.840 align:start position:0%
we have to
 
08:18:22.150 --> 08:18:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
08:18:24.788 --> 08:18:24.798 align:start position:0%
and by the way it is only rain there is
 
08:18:26.388 --> 08:18:26.398 align:start position:0%
no snow for those of you who are
 
08:18:27.990 --> 08:18:28.000 align:start position:0%
concerned oh look at that it's all green
 
08:18:31.830 --> 08:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
08:18:35.910 --> 08:18:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
08:18:38.070 --> 08:18:38.080 align:start position:0%
all right just again give me hands how
 
08:18:41.350 --> 08:18:41.360 align:start position:0%
many want to stay
 
08:18:45.030 --> 08:18:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
08:18:47.030 --> 08:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
easy let's split the difference all
 
08:18:50.548 --> 08:18:50.558 align:start position:0%
right we'll split the difference 16 16.
 
08:18:52.868 --> 08:18:52.878 align:start position:0%
we can split the difference we can do a
 
08:18:56.308 --> 08:18:56.318 align:start position:0%
 
08:18:56.318 --> 08:19:01.350 align:start position:0%
 
16-16

08:19:01.350 --> 08:19:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
08:19:04.150 --> 08:19:04.160 align:start position:0%
hypodermic needles
 
08:19:04.160 --> 08:19:08.708 align:start position:0%
hypodermic needles
commission

08:19:08.708 --> 08:19:08.718 align:start position:0%
 
08:19:11.910 --> 08:19:11.920 align:start position:0%
this is right representative your keller
 
08:19:14.868 --> 08:19:14.878 align:start position:0%
rockingham 33.
 
08:19:14.878 --> 08:19:16.230 align:start position:0%
rockingham 33.
um

08:19:16.230 --> 08:19:16.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
08:19:19.750 --> 08:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
as you know leadership in both parties
 
08:19:22.788 --> 08:19:22.798 align:start position:0%
has uh really put the word out
 
08:19:25.270 --> 08:19:25.280 align:start position:0%
we don't want to commit e
 
08:19:27.590 --> 08:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
we don't have the troops to phil commit
 
08:19:27.600 --> 08:19:28.628 align:start position:0%
we don't have the troops to phil commit
ease

08:19:28.628 --> 08:19:28.638 align:start position:0%
ease
 
08:19:30.948 --> 08:19:30.958 align:start position:0%
so i went to him as i went to
 
08:19:33.910 --> 08:19:33.920 align:start position:0%
representative donovan fenton earlier
 
08:19:35.910 --> 08:19:35.920 align:start position:0%
and said don't you think it would be
 
08:19:35.920 --> 08:19:37.270 align:start position:0%
and said don't you think it would be
better

08:19:37.270 --> 08:19:37.280 align:start position:0%
better
 
08:19:37.280 --> 08:19:38.150 align:start position:0%
better
if

08:19:38.150 --> 08:19:38.160 align:start position:0%
if
 
08:19:40.628 --> 08:19:40.638 align:start position:0%
you pulled together an ad hoc group of
 
08:19:42.788 --> 08:19:42.798 align:start position:0%
people with the kind of people who could
 
08:19:45.270 --> 08:19:45.280 align:start position:0%
speak well to this and then you do your
 
08:19:47.430 --> 08:19:47.440 align:start position:0%
work and don't come in with a bill
 
08:19:50.070 --> 08:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
asking for committee come in with a bill
 
08:19:52.070 --> 08:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
asking for policy
 
08:19:54.230 --> 08:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
so that is what i said to him and i
 
08:19:56.788 --> 08:19:56.798 align:start position:0%
suppose before that you heard me say i
 
08:19:59.430 --> 08:19:59.440 align:start position:0%
opened the exec session on house bill
 
08:19:59.440 --> 08:20:02.868 align:start position:0%
opened the exec session on house bill
1616.

08:20:02.868 --> 08:20:02.878 align:start position:0%
 
08:20:05.510 --> 08:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
and so the conversation i had with
 
08:20:08.868 --> 08:20:08.878 align:start position:0%
representative yokala was we don't
 
08:20:11.510 --> 08:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
really want a commission
 
08:20:14.308 --> 08:20:14.318 align:start position:0%
what do you think and we had a nice chat
 
08:20:17.830 --> 08:20:17.840 align:start position:0%
and this is a big red juicy
 
08:20:17.840 --> 08:20:34.628 align:start position:0%
and this is a big red juicy
what

08:20:34.628 --> 08:20:34.638 align:start position:0%
 
08:20:37.910 --> 08:20:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
08:20:41.030 --> 08:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
okay we need expertise on epipens but
 
08:20:42.628 --> 08:20:42.638 align:start position:0%
what i understood was they're not
 
08:20:44.548 --> 08:20:44.558 align:start position:0%
dangerous to carry but right now they're
 
08:20:47.270 --> 08:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
illegal and it just seems nuts that
 
08:20:49.990 --> 08:20:50.000 align:start position:0%
somebody up to 18 can't carry their own
 
08:20:52.230 --> 08:20:52.240 align:start position:0%
epipen so i don't want a committee
 
08:20:54.230 --> 08:20:54.240 align:start position:0%
either but it would be nice if we just
 
08:20:56.308 --> 08:20:56.318 align:start position:0%
had a real simple bill that said you can
 
08:20:58.708 --> 08:20:58.718 align:start position:0%
carry an empty pin but we don't we have
 
08:21:02.788 --> 08:21:02.798 align:start position:0%
this bill this bill is being exact it's
 
08:21:05.270 --> 08:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
about a committee or commission
 
08:21:07.910 --> 08:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
mr representative merchant
 
08:21:10.230 --> 08:21:10.240 align:start position:0%
in regards to the epipen
 
08:21:13.030 --> 08:21:13.040 align:start position:0%
i don't know of any reason or any law or
 
08:21:15.510 --> 08:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
rule or regulation if the pen's been
 
08:21:17.590 --> 08:21:17.600 align:start position:0%
prescribed to the child
 
08:21:20.070 --> 08:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
that child can use that epipen
 
08:21:21.430 --> 08:21:21.440 align:start position:0%
the other question is going to be quite
 
08:21:23.670 --> 08:21:23.680 align:start position:0%
frankly if somebody else is with that
 
08:21:26.388 --> 08:21:26.398 align:start position:0%
child who has the epipen with him
 
08:21:28.708 --> 08:21:28.718 align:start position:0%
that person could administer the epipen
 
08:21:30.708 --> 08:21:30.718 align:start position:0%
to them so i don't know if we need to
 
08:21:33.590 --> 08:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
worry about the epipen part of it at all
 
08:21:33.600 --> 08:21:35.830 align:start position:0%
worry about the epipen part of it at all
okay

08:21:35.830 --> 08:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
08:21:37.190 --> 08:21:37.200 align:start position:0%
sounds like we have two people who can
 
08:21:48.070 --> 08:21:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
08:21:50.548 --> 08:21:50.558 align:start position:0%
any further discussion if you re-read
 
08:21:53.350 --> 08:21:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
08:21:58.468 --> 08:21:58.478 align:start position:0%
 
08:22:01.510 --> 08:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
syringes and needles
 
08:22:03.190 --> 08:22:03.200 align:start position:0%
whether the restrictions should be
 
08:22:05.110 --> 08:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
eliminated it's a discussion group the
 
08:22:07.750 --> 08:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
bill is a discussion group if you vote
 
08:22:10.548 --> 08:22:10.558 align:start position:0%
for this bill you do not get anything
 
08:22:14.628 --> 08:22:14.638 align:start position:0%
 
08:22:16.948 --> 08:22:16.958 align:start position:0%
so any further
 
08:22:23.030 --> 08:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
08:22:24.468 --> 08:22:24.478 align:start position:0%
to report somebody
 
08:22:25.990 --> 08:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
