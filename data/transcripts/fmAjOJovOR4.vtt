00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:14.879 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 align:start position:0%
this is a work session so we don't need
 
00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 align:start position:0%
a quorum which is nice
 
00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 align:start position:0%
um we'll start off very quickly with the
 
00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.670 align:start position:0%
um we'll start off very quickly with the
pledge

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 align:start position:0%
pledge
 
00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 align:start position:0%
um representative Phillips you're
 
00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 align:start position:0%
joining us would you like to do the
 
00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:47.330 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 align:start position:0%
um I do expect today's work session to
 
00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 align:start position:0%
be probably our shorter one out of the
 
00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 align:start position:0%
ones we're going to have I'm only
 
00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
planning on having about two more of the
 
00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 align:start position:0%
work sessions and then two more field
 
00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 align:start position:0%
sessions uh and then the game plan will
 
00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:00.599 align:start position:0%
be to reconvene the subcommittee either
 
00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 align:start position:0%
once or twice before the filing deadline
 
00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 align:start position:0%
um so we can kind of do our our last big
 
00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 align:start position:0%
push of things that we think we can
 
00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 align:start position:0%
agree on
 
00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 align:start position:0%
um and maybe things that we can't agree
 
00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 align:start position:0%
on but we should try anyways from the
 
00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 align:start position:0%
respective sides
 
00:03:15.649 --> 00:03:15.659 align:start position:0%
um so the next two work sessions though
 
00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 align:start position:0%
the next one will be about
 
00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 align:start position:0%
um will be the content from the study
 
00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:22.319 align:start position:0%
committee that we retained that was part
 
00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:23.879 align:start position:0%
of the deal pertaining it so obviously
 
00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 align:start position:0%
operating in faith we will then do that
 
00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 align:start position:0%
um I believe representative O'Neill is
 
00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 align:start position:0%
looking into a field session for us
 
00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 align:start position:0%
um a field listening session for Us in
 
00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 align:start position:0%
Manchester I believe she's taking point
 
00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 align:start position:0%
on that she didn't message me about it
 
00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 align:start position:0%
um she asked what the parameters were
 
00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 align:start position:0%
and I said Wednesday at 5 30 anywhere in
 
00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:42.770 align:start position:0%
and I said Wednesday at 5 30 anywhere in
Manchester

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 align:start position:0%
Manchester
 
00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819 align:start position:0%
um so those are her parameters she can't
 
00:03:46.369 --> 00:03:46.379 align:start position:0%
be here today
 
00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 align:start position:0%
um today's subjects is the granted steps
 
00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 align:start position:0%
for Quality program
 
00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 align:start position:0%
um and then the one that I know is going
 
00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 align:start position:0%
to be the most contentious which is the
 
00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 align:start position:0%
child care ratios
 
00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 align:start position:0%
so I want to start off with the grant
 
00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 align:start position:0%
steps for Quality program
 
00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 align:start position:0%
um and kind of what I have heard
 
00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 align:start position:0%
um in my experience with it which is
 
00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 align:start position:0%
that it it appears that it is not
 
00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:11.819 align:start position:0%
serving well I would start off with I
 
00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 align:start position:0%
think there is some confusion as to what
 
00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:16.199 align:start position:0%
its function is supposed to be
 
00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 align:start position:0%
um so my understanding is that it's
 
00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 align:start position:0%
function obviously the function is to
 
00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 align:start position:0%
increase the quality care for child care
 
00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire
 
00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 align:start position:0%
um it's literally the name right
 
00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 align:start position:0%
um the the issue is I believe some
 
00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 align:start position:0%
providers are looking at it as a if I do
 
00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 align:start position:0%
this this will be a monetary gain for me
 
00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 align:start position:0%
and I think that's where the disconnect
 
00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:38.699 align:start position:0%
is happening
 
00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 align:start position:0%
um I think our friend Jen sent us a very
 
00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 align:start position:0%
well well done document I believe we've
 
00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 align:start position:0%
all read that
 
00:04:46.189 --> 00:04:46.199 align:start position:0%
um basically outlining how if you enter
 
00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 align:start position:0%
into the quality steps for Care Program
 
00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 align:start position:0%
you'll actually lose money as a provider
 
00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:53.100 align:start position:0%
um so I think that's
 
00:04:55.249 --> 00:04:55.259 align:start position:0%
for the committee that's probably the
 
00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 align:start position:0%
number one place that we should look at
 
00:04:58.909 --> 00:04:58.919 align:start position:0%
is if providers are going to enter into
 
00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.660 align:start position:0%
that program
 
00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:02.880 align:start position:0%
um they shouldn't be doing so at a
 
00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 align:start position:0%
financial loss
 
00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.500 align:start position:0%
um so it is a I believe it's a federally
 
00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 align:start position:0%
backed program so there are some pretty
 
00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:10.919 align:start position:0%
big guard rails on it it's my
 
00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:12.650 align:start position:0%
big guard rails on it it's my
understanding

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:12.660 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 align:start position:0%
um so if anybody wants to get up and
 
00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 align:start position:0%
speak to that
 
00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 align:start position:0%
um I'd be happy to hear from them their
 
00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
experiences with it I was hoping Jim
 
00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:21.419 align:start position:0%
would be here because she obviously but
 
00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
she's not so anybody like to DHHS you
 
00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:29.350 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:34.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:37.860 align:start position:0%
good morning my Karen Hebert
 
00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:40.440 align:start position:0%
economic stability at DHHS
 
00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:43.380 align:start position:0%
and I am happy to provide information
 
00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
about gsq at a very high level I think
 
00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:49.380 align:start position:0%
it's important for the committee to know
 
00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:51.060 align:start position:0%
that at this time
 
00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:53.060 align:start position:0%
we are
 
00:05:56.749 --> 00:05:56.759 align:start position:0%
initiating a more formal comprehensive
 
00:06:01.249 --> 00:06:01.259 align:start position:0%
evaluation of gsq so that we would be
 
00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:05.360 align:start position:0%
able to address any recommendations
 
00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:08.639 align:start position:0%
within that and make adjustments to the
 
00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:09.710 align:start position:0%
within that and make adjustments to the
system

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:09.720 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:12.180 align:start position:0%
uh it'll probably take a little bit of
 
00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:13.940 align:start position:0%
time to do that we have a procurement
 
00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:17.180 align:start position:0%
that's ongoing right now we should be
 
00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:20.900 align:start position:0%
bringing that to GNC by the end of June
 
00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:24.060 align:start position:0%
uh with a contract and part of that
 
00:06:26.689 --> 00:06:26.699 align:start position:0%
procurement includes some of the
 
00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:29.280 align:start position:0%
evaluation components that we want but
 
00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:32.940 align:start position:0%
we will be expanding that quite broadly
 
00:06:35.749 --> 00:06:35.759 align:start position:0%
so we're just initiating that now and I
 
00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:37.560 align:start position:0%
think that it's important
 
00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:40.860 align:start position:0%
um that we take everything into
 
00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:43.500 align:start position:0%
consideration about this particular
 
00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:47.400 align:start position:0%
system we all want a quality system but
 
00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:50.280 align:start position:0%
I think that you are correct that it is
 
00:06:53.809 --> 00:06:53.819 align:start position:0%
focused on quality and the funding that
 
00:06:59.150 --> 00:06:59.160 align:start position:0%
is attached to gsq was never intended to
 
00:07:02.629 --> 00:07:02.639 align:start position:0%
cover any and all expenses of what it
 
00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:06.840 align:start position:0%
may take to bring a provider up to a
 
00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:08.580 align:start position:0%
certain standards so that we would all
 
00:07:10.189 --> 00:07:10.199 align:start position:0%
like to see
 
00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:13.500 align:start position:0%
but it is it does provide some funding
 
00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:16.220 align:start position:0%
in order to incentivize
 
00:07:19.129 --> 00:07:19.139 align:start position:0%
the providers to be able to do that so
 
00:07:21.129 --> 00:07:21.139 align:start position:0%
although it's a smaller amount of money
 
00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:23.880 align:start position:0%
that is the intent behind it but it has
 
00:07:26.629 --> 00:07:26.639 align:start position:0%
never been to fund the entire quality
 
00:07:29.029 --> 00:07:29.039 align:start position:0%
system for folks
 
00:07:29.039 --> 00:07:29.809 align:start position:0%
system for folks
um

00:07:29.809 --> 00:07:29.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:31.860 align:start position:0%
so I guess I would ask the committee
 
00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:34.080 align:start position:0%
that you know we have the opportunity to
 
00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
conduct this evaluation I'd be happy to
 
00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:39.900 align:start position:0%
report back on that it will likely take
 
00:07:41.809 --> 00:07:41.819 align:start position:0%
several months
 
00:07:43.909 --> 00:07:43.919 align:start position:0%
um but we currently have over 80
 
00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:47.880 align:start position:0%
providers in the system now so we want
 
00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:49.740 align:start position:0%
to make sure that they are able to
 
00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:53.280 align:start position:0%
continue within that process and not
 
00:07:56.570 --> 00:07:56.580 align:start position:0%
disrupt what it is that they're doing we
 
00:07:58.550 --> 00:07:58.560 align:start position:0%
have about I think another 30 who have
 
00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:02.280 align:start position:0%
recently applied so it is growing but
 
00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:03.900 align:start position:0%
the the procurement that I mentioned
 
00:08:07.189 --> 00:08:07.199 align:start position:0%
earlier is also intended so that it
 
00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:09.660 align:start position:0%
would provide guidance and assistance
 
00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:12.720 align:start position:0%
and support for providers in entering
 
00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:15.300 align:start position:0%
onboarding into the system and also
 
00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:17.400 align:start position:0%
throughout the system with things like
 
00:08:20.629 --> 00:08:20.639 align:start position:0%
coaching and assessments uh also other
 
00:08:23.689 --> 00:08:23.699 align:start position:0%
funding opportunities for them to reach
 
00:08:25.909 --> 00:08:25.919 align:start position:0%
these standards that we are wanting to
 
00:08:25.919 --> 00:08:28.089 align:start position:0%
these standards that we are wanting to
reach

00:08:28.089 --> 00:08:28.099 align:start position:0%
reach
 
00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:29.940 align:start position:0%
specific questions I definitely have
 
00:08:33.709 --> 00:08:33.719 align:start position:0%
some um some cover I just want to convey
 
00:08:36.170 --> 00:08:36.180 align:start position:0%
um things that I have heard I I'm glad
 
00:08:38.149 --> 00:08:38.159 align:start position:0%
you're evaluating it I knew it was I'd
 
00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:40.140 align:start position:0%
heard it was getting revisions some of
 
00:08:42.050 --> 00:08:42.060 align:start position:0%
the concerns that we had
 
00:08:44.149 --> 00:08:44.159 align:start position:0%
heard was that providers that were
 
00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:45.660 align:start position:0%
currently in the system weren't aware of
 
00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:47.640 align:start position:0%
changes that were happening
 
00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:49.740 align:start position:0%
um and there was a I would say quite
 
00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:50.940 align:start position:0%
considerable amount of frustration
 
00:08:53.509 --> 00:08:53.519 align:start position:0%
expressed to the committee about that
 
00:08:54.949 --> 00:08:54.959 align:start position:0%
um so that's the political way of
 
00:08:56.269 --> 00:08:56.279 align:start position:0%
putting that
 
00:08:58.670 --> 00:08:58.680 align:start position:0%
um so I guess my message to you guys as
 
00:09:00.889 --> 00:09:00.899 align:start position:0%
you're doing your due diligence
 
00:09:00.899 --> 00:09:01.490 align:start position:0%
you're doing your due diligence
um

00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:01.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:03.180 align:start position:0%
is you know be aware that the providers
 
00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:05.100 align:start position:0%
that are in there are very precariously
 
00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:07.980 align:start position:0%
watching to make sure that the goal post
 
00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:10.140 align:start position:0%
is not getting moved I will say we heard
 
00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:13.260 align:start position:0%
in Conway one of the frustrations was
 
00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:16.980 align:start position:0%
that the goal post was being moved to be
 
00:09:18.889 --> 00:09:18.899 align:start position:0%
easier to hit and they had hit a farther
 
00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
away goal post
 
00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:22.620 align:start position:0%
um and they didn't think that that was
 
00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
um I think Fair
 
00:09:26.329 --> 00:09:26.339 align:start position:0%
I don't know if that's the proper way to
 
00:09:29.389 --> 00:09:29.399 align:start position:0%
look at that just speaking personally
 
00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
um I think it's more of a statement of
 
00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:33.650 align:start position:0%
um I think it's more of a statement of
um

00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:33.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:35.449 --> 00:09:35.459 align:start position:0%
you know is the is the program headed in
 
00:09:37.009 --> 00:09:37.019 align:start position:0%
the right direction if they go close for
 
00:09:38.810 --> 00:09:38.820 align:start position:0%
moving away from them that would be
 
00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:40.380 align:start position:0%
that would be a whole other story but if
 
00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
it's moving it closer you know it's fine
 
00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:44.220 align:start position:0%
um can you talk about you said you in
 
00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:45.660 align:start position:0%
junior bringing a procurement to
 
00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:47.580 align:start position:0%
governor and Council can you talk about
 
00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:51.060 align:start position:0%
what that procurement entails um sure I
 
00:09:53.449 --> 00:09:53.459 align:start position:0%
would like to also respond to your
 
00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:55.200 align:start position:0%
comments about the providers who have
 
00:09:58.130 --> 00:09:58.140 align:start position:0%
expressed some concerns we met with that
 
00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:01.800 align:start position:0%
group a couple of weeks ago myself uh
 
00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:03.300 align:start position:0%
commission associate commissioner Chris
 
00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:05.700 align:start position:0%
santanello and the president of the
 
00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:07.680 align:start position:0%
child care advisory Council Marianne
 
00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:09.540 align:start position:0%
barter we met at the governor's office
 
00:10:11.509 --> 00:10:11.519 align:start position:0%
with the governor's office about those
 
00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:13.740 align:start position:0%
concerns and we did come up with a
 
00:10:15.829 --> 00:10:15.839 align:start position:0%
particular agreement with them about
 
00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:17.640 align:start position:0%
moving forward that does include this
 
00:10:20.509 --> 00:10:20.519 align:start position:0%
comprehensive evaluation so we've heard
 
00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:22.920 align:start position:0%
what they've had to say and are we're
 
00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:25.560 align:start position:0%
taking steps that includes suspending
 
00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
portions of it for those who who are
 
00:10:30.829 --> 00:10:30.839 align:start position:0%
having some struggles with or challenges
 
00:10:32.509 --> 00:10:32.519 align:start position:0%
with understanding
 
00:10:35.690 --> 00:10:35.700 align:start position:0%
what it is that's expected
 
00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:37.800 align:start position:0%
I think that it's clear there's a
 
00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:40.500 align:start position:0%
disconnect somewhere because well we
 
00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:42.360 align:start position:0%
have a number of providers who are
 
00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:44.700 align:start position:0%
completely engaged in this system and
 
00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:47.160 align:start position:0%
it's effective for them we are obviously
 
00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:49.680 align:start position:0%
seeing a number of providers that is not
 
00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:51.420 align:start position:0%
so effective and they have a lot of
 
00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:54.300 align:start position:0%
questions very valid questions and we
 
00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
are taking the opportunity to address
 
00:10:58.490 --> 00:10:58.500 align:start position:0%
that we're currently taking steps to
 
00:11:00.949 --> 00:11:00.959 align:start position:0%
expand an advisory committee that's been
 
00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:04.260 align:start position:0%
in place for gsq for for several months
 
00:11:06.829 --> 00:11:06.839 align:start position:0%
so I think that where you know the the
 
00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:09.240 align:start position:0%
program feels like it's been
 
00:11:11.290 --> 00:11:11.300 align:start position:0%
communicating effectively with people
 
00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:14.100 align:start position:0%
but apparently not everybody is
 
00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
understanding so where is the disconnect
 
00:11:19.069 --> 00:11:19.079 align:start position:0%
we need to identify that and make sure
 
00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
that everybody is clear so that advisory
 
00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:24.140 align:start position:0%
committee we're looking at expanding it
 
00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:26.760 align:start position:0%
so that it includes a more broader
 
00:11:29.530 --> 00:11:29.540 align:start position:0%
representation of the provider community
 
00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:32.640 align:start position:0%
and I'm sorry NRP you said the provider
 
00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:40.610 align:start position:0%
and I'm sorry NRP you said the provider
community

00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:40.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:41.930 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:41.940 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:44.160 align:start position:0%
um they were very pleased the providers
 
00:11:45.829 --> 00:11:45.839 align:start position:0%
that we met with with the governor's
 
00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:48.540 align:start position:0%
office with the conditions that we put
 
00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:50.760 align:start position:0%
in place they seem to be satisfied with
 
00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:52.200 align:start position:0%
that and we're going to be meeting with
 
00:11:54.170 --> 00:11:54.180 align:start position:0%
them again we'll invite them to the
 
00:11:56.449 --> 00:11:56.459 align:start position:0%
advisory committee once we have
 
00:11:59.210 --> 00:11:59.220 align:start position:0%
broadened that committee I'm in
 
00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:01.260 align:start position:0%
preparing a charter at this time in
 
00:12:03.290 --> 00:12:03.300 align:start position:0%
order to put the parameters in place for
 
00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:05.100 align:start position:0%
what that should look like and it'll be
 
00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:09.560 align:start position:0%
very visible we will make sure that
 
00:12:12.530 --> 00:12:12.540 align:start position:0%
the information and minutes that come
 
00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:14.160 align:start position:0%
out of that particular meeting are
 
00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:16.740 align:start position:0%
available for public viewing
 
00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:19.680 align:start position:0%
I I do know that one of their
 
00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:21.180 align:start position:0%
um it sounds like you've addressed it
 
00:12:23.389 --> 00:12:23.399 align:start position:0%
one of their complaints was that
 
00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:25.200 align:start position:0%
providers weren't properly represented
 
00:12:26.329 --> 00:12:26.339 align:start position:0%
that was their complaint I'm just
 
00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:27.720 align:start position:0%
conveying that
 
00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:30.240 align:start position:0%
um so I'm glad I'm excited delayed
 
00:12:31.610 --> 00:12:31.620 align:start position:0%
delighted to hear that as a provider
 
00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:33.110 align:start position:0%
delighted to hear that as a provider
myself

00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
myself
 
00:12:35.389 --> 00:12:35.399 align:start position:0%
um and then the other one the other
 
00:12:36.949 --> 00:12:36.959 align:start position:0%
complaint that they had had once again
 
00:12:38.329 --> 00:12:38.339 align:start position:0%
I'm just relaying the complaints so
 
00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:40.500 align:start position:0%
don't don't shoot the messenger I have
 
00:12:41.449 --> 00:12:41.459 align:start position:0%
plenty of people in Concord already
 
00:12:43.009 --> 00:12:43.019 align:start position:0%
trying to do that to me
 
00:12:43.019 --> 00:12:43.670 align:start position:0%
trying to do that to me
um

00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:43.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:12:47.569 --> 00:12:47.579 align:start position:0%
the the other complaint that they had
 
00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:50.160 align:start position:0%
was that the people who were on the
 
00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:52.680 align:start position:0%
board for gsq The Advisory Board
 
00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:54.360 align:start position:0%
um were not a part of any of the changes
 
00:12:56.329 --> 00:12:56.339 align:start position:0%
that were proposed so can you kind of
 
00:12:57.889 --> 00:12:57.899 align:start position:0%
address that complaint that we have
 
00:12:59.269 --> 00:12:59.279 align:start position:0%
heard is there any validity to that
 
00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:01.980 align:start position:0%
obviously I'm I'm new to this realm uh
 
00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:04.980 align:start position:0%
the side of the gsq so um I I'm not I'm
 
00:13:07.009 --> 00:13:07.019 align:start position:0%
not leveling the accusation I just once
 
00:13:08.329 --> 00:13:08.339 align:start position:0%
again bringing the message forward is
 
00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:09.720 align:start position:0%
there validity to that statement are
 
00:13:11.629 --> 00:13:11.639 align:start position:0%
they out of their mind um like what's
 
00:13:15.050 --> 00:13:15.060 align:start position:0%
going on that's a great question so uh
 
00:13:17.389 --> 00:13:17.399 align:start position:0%
and it's difficult for me to speak on
 
00:13:20.269 --> 00:13:20.279 align:start position:0%
behalf of that particular group and what
 
00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:22.440 align:start position:0%
it is other than what I've heard myself
 
00:13:25.310 --> 00:13:25.320 align:start position:0%
from them directly in what they did not
 
00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
understand about the revisions that were
 
00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:29.880 align:start position:0%
being made yet on the other hand I have
 
00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:32.160 align:start position:0%
an advisory committee and the program
 
00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:34.200 align:start position:0%
that is basically stating we have
 
00:13:37.069 --> 00:13:37.079 align:start position:0%
informed everyone we have uh we're
 
00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:39.540 align:start position:0%
available for we've provided office
 
00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
hours we've provided a lot of
 
00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
information over a long period of time
 
00:13:45.769 --> 00:13:45.779 align:start position:0%
about what it is that this system is
 
00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
going to look like including some of the
 
00:13:50.949 --> 00:13:50.959 align:start position:0%
enhancements that were
 
00:13:55.850 --> 00:13:55.860 align:start position:0%
deployed in March of 23. so
 
00:13:59.210 --> 00:13:59.220 align:start position:0%
that there's one you know part of this
 
00:14:01.930 --> 00:14:01.940 align:start position:0%
that we feel that we are communicating
 
00:14:05.449 --> 00:14:05.459 align:start position:0%
but then it's not quite being understood
 
00:14:08.569 --> 00:14:08.579 align:start position:0%
by recipients and I think that
 
00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
um their concerns are are fair and valid
 
00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:12.600 align:start position:0%
and I think we just need to address them
 
00:14:14.930 --> 00:14:14.940 align:start position:0%
which were in that process of doing it
 
00:14:16.370 --> 00:14:16.380 align:start position:0%
it sounds like we're headed to the right
 
00:14:17.569 --> 00:14:17.579 align:start position:0%
just what you're saying it sounds like
 
00:14:19.190 --> 00:14:19.200 align:start position:0%
we're headed in a better path than where
 
00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:21.000 align:start position:0%
we were I'd say even maybe two or three
 
00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:22.440 align:start position:0%
weeks ago
 
00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:23.030 align:start position:0%
weeks ago
um

00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:24.769 --> 00:14:24.779 align:start position:0%
so that's that was the whole point of
 
00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:27.180 align:start position:0%
having today was the complaints we had
 
00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:28.860 align:start position:0%
heard two or three weeks ago so it
 
00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:30.720 align:start position:0%
sounds like we are um we're moving the
 
00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:31.680 align:start position:0%
right path the fact that there's not
 
00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:32.820 align:start position:0%
many of them here today probably tells
 
00:14:35.269 --> 00:14:35.279 align:start position:0%
me that they may suddenly believe that
 
00:14:37.370 --> 00:14:37.380 align:start position:0%
um representative page can you talk can
 
00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:38.940 align:start position:0%
you talk to me about how this was
 
00:14:41.810 --> 00:14:41.820 align:start position:0%
communicated to your participants
 
00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:44.220 align:start position:0%
I think you know what I'm hearing is
 
00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:45.720 align:start position:0%
that there's a lot of effort to
 
00:14:47.509 --> 00:14:47.519 align:start position:0%
communicate but when people are not
 
00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
understanding to me that's an indication
 
00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:51.480 align:start position:0%
that maybe the way it's being
 
00:14:53.389 --> 00:14:53.399 align:start position:0%
communicated is not how they need to
 
00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
receive it if this seems to be
 
00:14:57.350 --> 00:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
you know so I just I want to make sure
 
00:14:59.210 --> 00:14:59.220 align:start position:0%
we're not saying that the providers are
 
00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:01.680 align:start position:0%
not understanding and getting it how are
 
00:15:03.889 --> 00:15:03.899 align:start position:0%
we not communicating to them effectively
 
00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:06.060 align:start position:0%
so what do we need to change so that
 
00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:07.800 align:start position:0%
this doesn't recur and that's something
 
00:15:10.069 --> 00:15:10.079 align:start position:0%
we need to really take a closer look at
 
00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:12.660 align:start position:0%
so I know that there's been a great deal
 
00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
of email communication to the provider
 
00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:18.480 align:start position:0%
Community we've certainly
 
00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:21.540 align:start position:0%
um you know open it up for office hours
 
00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:24.120 align:start position:0%
so to speak for people to call when they
 
00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:27.000 align:start position:0%
have questions we receive a lot of calls
 
00:15:29.269 --> 00:15:29.279 align:start position:0%
from providers asking specific questions
 
00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
about the gsq so we take the time to be
 
00:15:36.050 --> 00:15:36.060 align:start position:0%
able to explain to them what we find I
 
00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
think is that perhaps the guide is a
 
00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:40.440 align:start position:0%
little bit overwhelming
 
00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:42.180 align:start position:0%
to people so there's a very
 
00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:43.980 align:start position:0%
comprehensive guide that's out there now
 
00:15:46.189 --> 00:15:46.199 align:start position:0%
plus the revisions
 
00:15:49.009 --> 00:15:49.019 align:start position:0%
plus a a third guide on the incentives
 
00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:51.540 align:start position:0%
and how that works so I think that it's
 
00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:53.940 align:start position:0%
so much information perhaps it's too
 
00:15:55.970 --> 00:15:55.980 align:start position:0%
much information that people are just
 
00:15:58.790 --> 00:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
not being able to and I think from the
 
00:16:01.189 --> 00:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
provider's perspective as well of course
 
00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:03.660 align:start position:0%
folks behind me can speak more to that
 
00:16:06.410 --> 00:16:06.420 align:start position:0%
but I think that
 
00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:08.160 align:start position:0%
you know when you have so much
 
00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:10.980 align:start position:0%
information and and since covid
 
00:16:13.370 --> 00:16:13.380 align:start position:0%
providers are really struggling as you
 
00:16:15.769 --> 00:16:15.779 align:start position:0%
probably have heard trying to just
 
00:16:15.779 --> 00:16:17.090 align:start position:0%
probably have heard trying to just
maintain

00:16:17.090 --> 00:16:17.100 align:start position:0%
maintain
 
00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:20.160 align:start position:0%
uh their their business trying to grow
 
00:16:21.829 --> 00:16:21.839 align:start position:0%
trying to move forward and away from
 
00:16:23.449 --> 00:16:23.459 align:start position:0%
covid which has been very very
 
00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:25.980 align:start position:0%
challenging with Workforce issues
 
00:16:27.949 --> 00:16:27.959 align:start position:0%
so in light of that I think having to
 
00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:30.360 align:start position:0%
take the time to sit down and read a
 
00:16:32.689 --> 00:16:32.699 align:start position:0%
multi-page guide never mind three of
 
00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:35.940 align:start position:0%
them is probably a lot to ask so I know
 
00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:37.620 align:start position:0%
that we get a lot of questions from
 
00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:39.720 align:start position:0%
providers about what information that's
 
00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:42.180 align:start position:0%
already in the guide which tells me that
 
00:16:44.210 --> 00:16:44.220 align:start position:0%
people are probably not reading it
 
00:16:46.069 --> 00:16:46.079 align:start position:0%
thoroughly enough they don't have time
 
00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:48.600 align:start position:0%
they don't have the ability to just
 
00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:50.220 align:start position:0%
schedule that and manage their business
 
00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
at the same time I get that
 
00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:56.040 align:start position:0%
um so how can we share the information a
 
00:16:58.009 --> 00:16:58.019 align:start position:0%
little bit differently and I think that
 
00:16:59.749 --> 00:16:59.759 align:start position:0%
we need to incorporate that into an
 
00:17:02.689 --> 00:17:02.699 align:start position:0%
evaluation that includes that provider
 
00:17:05.449 --> 00:17:05.459 align:start position:0%
input it's beyond input this is a
 
00:17:07.429 --> 00:17:07.439 align:start position:0%
partnership so we need to be able to
 
00:17:09.169 --> 00:17:09.179 align:start position:0%
make sure that we have that open
 
00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:11.400 align:start position:0%
communication because when we do have
 
00:17:13.429 --> 00:17:13.439 align:start position:0%
people that don't understand it then
 
00:17:14.990 --> 00:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
obviously we have a product that isn't
 
00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.549 align:start position:0%
obviously we have a product that isn't
effective

00:17:16.549 --> 00:17:16.559 align:start position:0%
effective
 
00:17:18.409 --> 00:17:18.419 align:start position:0%
it was not effective nobody's going to
 
00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
win so while we have some groups that
 
00:17:22.970 --> 00:17:22.980 align:start position:0%
they do understand it and they're moving
 
00:17:25.189 --> 00:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
forward with it why is it that some do
 
00:17:27.289 --> 00:17:27.299 align:start position:0%
and some don't so a lot of questions
 
00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:32.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:34.440 align:start position:0%
um you said your testimony that
 
00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:36.120 align:start position:0%
um March 23rd you guys rolled out
 
00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:37.370 align:start position:0%
um March 23rd you guys rolled out
enhancements

00:17:37.370 --> 00:17:37.380 align:start position:0%
enhancements
 
00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:38.640 align:start position:0%
can you outline some of those
 
00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:40.250 align:start position:0%
can you outline some of those
enhancements

00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:40.260 align:start position:0%
enhancements
 
00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:42.360 align:start position:0%
is that two is that two in the gritty I
 
00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:43.740 align:start position:0%
can well you know maybe in the
 
00:17:45.529 --> 00:17:45.539 align:start position:0%
nitty-gritty I'd be happy to provide you
 
00:17:47.810 --> 00:17:47.820 align:start position:0%
with a copy of that I don't think that's
 
00:17:51.409 --> 00:17:51.419 align:start position:0%
a lengthy document but it basically
 
00:17:54.890 --> 00:17:54.900 align:start position:0%
um puts in place uh additional coaching
 
00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:57.169 align:start position:0%
um puts in place uh additional coaching
opportunities

00:17:57.169 --> 00:17:57.179 align:start position:0%
opportunities
 
00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:00.840 align:start position:0%
um ability to be on some leadership
 
00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:02.270 align:start position:0%
um ability to be on some leadership
tracks

00:18:02.270 --> 00:18:02.280 align:start position:0%
tracks
 
00:18:04.909 --> 00:18:04.919 align:start position:0%
again I have to pull up the document
 
00:18:06.770 --> 00:18:06.780 align:start position:0%
which I can just send you if that's easy
 
00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:08.520 align:start position:0%
but yeah that's fine I'd like to see
 
00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:10.440 align:start position:0%
that um you know because it goes into
 
00:18:11.810 --> 00:18:11.820 align:start position:0%
the whole
 
00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
um communication and what's going on
 
00:18:18.049 --> 00:18:18.059 align:start position:0%
um I do think in general you said
 
00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:20.340 align:start position:0%
there's 80 providers in there there's 30
 
00:18:24.049 --> 00:18:24.059 align:start position:0%
providers coming on board that's 110
 
00:18:27.049 --> 00:18:27.059 align:start position:0%
um and there's 529 licenses in the state
 
00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:28.440 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire
 
00:18:29.690 --> 00:18:29.700 align:start position:0%
um so you're looking at less than 20
 
00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:31.440 align:start position:0%
adoption rate
 
00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:32.090 align:start position:0%
adoption rate
um

00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:32.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
I guess probably the one thing I would
 
00:18:34.909 --> 00:18:34.919 align:start position:0%
disagree on is I don't think that that's
 
00:18:36.529 --> 00:18:36.539 align:start position:0%
so awesome
 
00:18:39.169 --> 00:18:39.179 align:start position:0%
um that's less than one out of five
 
00:18:39.179 --> 00:18:40.250 align:start position:0%
um that's less than one out of five
um

00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:40.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:42.770 --> 00:18:42.780 align:start position:0%
and part of the reason is that people
 
00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:44.640 align:start position:0%
aren't adopting this in my opinion is
 
00:18:46.370 --> 00:18:46.380 align:start position:0%
that they don't
 
00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
they don't need from a business
 
00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
perspective you don't need to do this
 
00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
right because the demand the demand and
 
00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:53.700 align:start position:0%
Supply are so out of whack right that
 
00:18:55.070 --> 00:18:55.080 align:start position:0%
this doesn't this doesn't give you a leg
 
00:18:56.450 --> 00:18:56.460 align:start position:0%
up in acquiring parents because
 
00:18:58.850 --> 00:18:58.860 align:start position:0%
acquiring acquiring parents and students
 
00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:00.360 align:start position:0%
is easy
 
00:19:02.570 --> 00:19:02.580 align:start position:0%
um so I think I think to the program's
 
00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
credit that's one of the reasons it's
 
00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
like it rolled out like the exact wrong
 
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.370 align:start position:0%
like it rolled out like the exact wrong
time

00:19:07.370 --> 00:19:07.380 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:10.260 align:start position:0%
um we had a huge Market imbalance
 
00:19:13.909 --> 00:19:13.919 align:start position:0%
so I I am kind of um
 
00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
I I am kind of curious as that number I
 
00:19:18.289 --> 00:19:18.299 align:start position:0%
said I do I do just respectfully
 
00:19:21.049 --> 00:19:21.059 align:start position:0%
disagree that 110 you know 80 right now
 
00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:22.500 align:start position:0%
30 potential
 
00:19:24.650 --> 00:19:24.660 align:start position:0%
um is not a um
 
00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
I I would say acceptable uptake for
 
00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:28.980 align:start position:0%
what's supposed to be Quality Care
 
00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:31.020 align:start position:0%
um I do look at this program as kind of
 
00:19:33.529 --> 00:19:33.539 align:start position:0%
like enhanced industry standards which
 
00:19:35.570 --> 00:19:35.580 align:start position:0%
may be a better way of uh putting it in
 
00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:37.080 align:start position:0%
a business term
 
00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:39.480 align:start position:0%
so you know I think I was I was a little
 
00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:41.400 align:start position:0%
hesitant to bring this subject up for
 
00:19:43.610 --> 00:19:43.620 align:start position:0%
this committee because it does slightly
 
00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:44.940 align:start position:0%
fall outside of what I would call our
 
00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
scope our scope being increasing access
 
00:19:50.810 --> 00:19:50.820 align:start position:0%
to Affordable and Safe Care
 
00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:51.960 align:start position:0%
um because this is literally quality
 
00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:53.090 align:start position:0%
um because this is literally quality
Care

00:19:53.090 --> 00:19:53.100 align:start position:0%
Care
 
00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:54.720 align:start position:0%
um but that being said it's the reason
 
00:19:56.029 --> 00:19:56.039 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons the program's not
 
00:19:57.890 --> 00:19:57.900 align:start position:0%
being taken up is because there's not
 
00:20:00.529 --> 00:20:00.539 align:start position:0%
access to any care
 
00:20:04.010 --> 00:20:04.020 align:start position:0%
um that's my that's my opining on the
 
00:20:06.049 --> 00:20:06.059 align:start position:0%
program What's the total uh monetary
 
00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:08.460 align:start position:0%
allocation for the program
 
00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
what it costs to run gsq
 
00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:12.660 align:start position:0%
what's it what's allocated from the
 
00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:13.909 align:start position:0%
what's it what's allocated from the
budget

00:20:13.909 --> 00:20:13.919 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
um I mean what's it I mean it's not
 
00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:17.460 align:start position:0%
budgets from the feds but that's a great
 
00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:19.080 align:start position:0%
question and I think I'd have to look
 
00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
that up to be able
 
00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:24.900 align:start position:0%
to okay if he gets that too
 
00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:25.549 align:start position:0%
to okay if he gets that too
um

00:20:25.549 --> 00:20:25.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:27.240 align:start position:0%
budgeting is done for this year but it's
 
00:20:28.850 --> 00:20:28.860 align:start position:0%
something for uh
 
00:20:31.549 --> 00:20:31.559 align:start position:0%
it's something for I mean it's we're
 
00:20:31.559 --> 00:20:32.810 align:start position:0%
it's something for I mean it's we're
required

00:20:32.810 --> 00:20:32.820 align:start position:0%
required
 
00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
um to expand
 
00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:38.520 align:start position:0%
sent of our federal funding from the
 
00:20:40.909 --> 00:20:40.919 align:start position:0%
child care Development Fund specifically
 
00:20:43.850 --> 00:20:43.860 align:start position:0%
for Quality activities of which this is
 
00:20:45.169 --> 00:20:45.179 align:start position:0%
including but I can get you more
 
00:20:46.490 --> 00:20:46.500 align:start position:0%
specific yeah that would be great
 
00:20:48.590 --> 00:20:48.600 align:start position:0%
because it's like 26 million or 36
 
00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:50.400 align:start position:0%
million dollar fund I cannot remember
 
00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:54.720 align:start position:0%
that is 36 or 38 I'll have to look that
 
00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:56.150 align:start position:0%
that is 36 or 38 I'll have to look that
up

00:20:56.150 --> 00:20:56.160 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:20:58.250 --> 00:20:58.260 align:start position:0%
an extra 40. so it's 36 and a 40 all
 
00:21:00.770 --> 00:21:00.780 align:start position:0%
right so nine percent of 36 million or
 
00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:03.720 align:start position:0%
96 or 40 million so roughly just under
 
00:21:06.169 --> 00:21:06.179 align:start position:0%
four million dollars doing the uh
 
00:21:10.210 --> 00:21:10.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:12.770 --> 00:21:12.780 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah it's yeah but that's what we
 
00:21:14.930 --> 00:21:14.940 align:start position:0%
use so that's what DHS has to use the
 
00:21:16.789 --> 00:21:16.799 align:start position:0%
nine percent and we're using it to the
 
00:21:18.529 --> 00:21:18.539 align:start position:0%
gsq to qualify for the nice for the
 
00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:21.480 align:start position:0%
block grant okay so just to get back to
 
00:21:23.150 --> 00:21:23.160 align:start position:0%
your other question with respect to the
 
00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:24.590 align:start position:0%
your other question with respect to the
procurement

00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
procurement
 
00:21:27.409 --> 00:21:27.419 align:start position:0%
um just in a again a high level summary
 
00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
this is basically to assist the
 
00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:32.640 align:start position:0%
department to help with the engagement
 
00:21:35.090 --> 00:21:35.100 align:start position:0%
and supportive programs in their
 
00:21:37.490 --> 00:21:37.500 align:start position:0%
continuous quality improvements
 
00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:40.140 align:start position:0%
um the uh
 
00:21:43.909 --> 00:21:43.919 align:start position:0%
um it includes a number of things the
 
00:21:46.490 --> 00:21:46.500 align:start position:0%
scope is pretty broad but it's basically
 
00:21:48.529 --> 00:21:48.539 align:start position:0%
in order to
 
00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:50.720 align:start position:0%
um on board
 
00:21:54.110 --> 00:21:54.120 align:start position:0%
staff help them with understanding the
 
00:21:55.909 --> 00:21:55.919 align:start position:0%
financial incentives and how that works
 
00:21:57.890 --> 00:21:57.900 align:start position:0%
uh connecting them with perhaps other
 
00:21:57.900 --> 00:21:59.470 align:start position:0%
uh connecting them with perhaps other
resources

00:21:59.470 --> 00:21:59.480 align:start position:0%
resources
 
00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
process and impact
 
00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:06.120 align:start position:0%
conducted an impact evaluation which I
 
00:22:08.350 --> 00:22:08.360 align:start position:0%
explained that we would want to broaden
 
00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
it includes a validation study it would
 
00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:13.260 align:start position:0%
also be for the coordination and
 
00:22:14.990 --> 00:22:15.000 align:start position:0%
provision of professional development
 
00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:18.360 align:start position:0%
activities for programs and staff
 
00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
as I mentioned onboarding it's support
 
00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:23.880 align:start position:0%
for programs developing additional
 
00:22:25.730 --> 00:22:25.740 align:start position:0%
system endorsements they would be able
 
00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:30.720 align:start position:0%
to create a pathway if you will for the
 
00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:31.610 align:start position:0%
to create a pathway if you will for the
different

00:22:31.610 --> 00:22:31.620 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:22:34.610 --> 00:22:34.620 align:start position:0%
for the two uh choices that they have
 
00:22:35.890 --> 00:22:35.900 align:start position:0%
for either
 
00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:39.000 align:start position:0%
going by the pathway for an
 
00:22:41.630 --> 00:22:41.640 align:start position:0%
environmental rating system or using the
 
00:22:44.330 --> 00:22:44.340 align:start position:0%
pyramid model so they the the
 
00:22:46.190 --> 00:22:46.200 align:start position:0%
procurement will be that the vendor will
 
00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:48.840 align:start position:0%
help us create those Pathways uh and for
 
00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:50.640 align:start position:0%
just further support for people
 
00:22:54.250 --> 00:22:54.260 align:start position:0%
conducting any Readiness checks
 
00:22:57.289 --> 00:22:57.299 align:start position:0%
further guidance
 
00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
expanding online access to the
 
00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:03.480 align:start position:0%
professional developments modules and
 
00:23:05.409 --> 00:23:05.419 align:start position:0%
other courses that are available
 
00:23:10.610 --> 00:23:10.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
representative page
 
00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:14.340 align:start position:0%
could the committee get a copy of the
 
00:23:16.669 --> 00:23:16.679 align:start position:0%
scope of work sure this I think that
 
00:23:18.830 --> 00:23:18.840 align:start position:0%
would be helpful to us
 
00:23:21.049 --> 00:23:21.059 align:start position:0%
yes representative Christian
 
00:23:22.610 --> 00:23:22.620 align:start position:0%
um one of the other things that we heard
 
00:23:24.529 --> 00:23:24.539 align:start position:0%
from a few of the providers I think in
 
00:23:24.539 --> 00:23:25.730 align:start position:0%
from a few of the providers I think in
Conway

00:23:25.730 --> 00:23:25.740 align:start position:0%
Conway
 
00:23:27.710 --> 00:23:27.720 align:start position:0%
um was that with some of the changes
 
00:23:30.049 --> 00:23:30.059 align:start position:0%
they said that they like suddenly needed
 
00:23:31.850 --> 00:23:31.860 align:start position:0%
to go take a new program and then
 
00:23:34.370 --> 00:23:34.380 align:start position:0%
weren't able to find it online have you
 
00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
heard anything about that or maybe
 
00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:38.760 align:start position:0%
materials that need updating so the
 
00:23:41.930 --> 00:23:41.940 align:start position:0%
links are going to the correct places or
 
00:23:44.029 --> 00:23:44.039 align:start position:0%
was that a misunderstanding that there's
 
00:23:47.029 --> 00:23:47.039 align:start position:0%
a concern with with online links I guess
 
00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:49.320 align:start position:0%
I I think so or they said that they
 
00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
needed to go take
 
00:23:52.610 --> 00:23:52.620 align:start position:0%
um you know some kind of quiz or
 
00:23:55.370 --> 00:23:55.380 align:start position:0%
assessment or something oh yeah thanks I
 
00:23:57.230 --> 00:23:57.240 align:start position:0%
think this followed the March
 
00:23:57.240 --> 00:23:59.029 align:start position:0%
think this followed the March
updates

00:23:59.029 --> 00:23:59.039 align:start position:0%
updates
 
00:24:01.909 --> 00:24:01.919 align:start position:0%
um that folks were had planned their
 
00:24:04.669 --> 00:24:04.679 align:start position:0%
schedule to go in and you know do do the
 
00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:06.720 align:start position:0%
work to on the next step
 
00:24:08.930 --> 00:24:08.940 align:start position:0%
came in and Mark saw the updates had
 
00:24:10.610 --> 00:24:10.620 align:start position:0%
been made and that certain modules that
 
00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:12.360 align:start position:0%
they needed to do in order to proceed
 
00:24:14.149 --> 00:24:14.159 align:start position:0%
would not be available till the fall so
 
00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
they of course had planned their whole
 
00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:17.880 align:start position:0%
schedule these updates were made they
 
00:24:20.930 --> 00:24:20.940 align:start position:0%
were not you know felt not in the loop
 
00:24:23.270 --> 00:24:23.280 align:start position:0%
um so that was the the comment you know
 
00:24:24.890 --> 00:24:24.900 align:start position:0%
that's that's the provider's perspective
 
00:24:27.529 --> 00:24:27.539 align:start position:0%
on that situation but that was the the
 
00:24:29.149 --> 00:24:29.159 align:start position:0%
situation that that provider described
 
00:24:31.310 --> 00:24:31.320 align:start position:0%
sure and they did provide us that
 
00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
information during our meeting with the
 
00:24:44.330 --> 00:24:44.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:45.110 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
so maybe this is already part of the
 
00:24:50.930 --> 00:24:50.940 align:start position:0%
scope of work but I'd love more Outreach
 
00:24:52.850 --> 00:24:52.860 align:start position:0%
to folks who are not participating to
 
00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
understand what their barriers are to
 
00:24:56.870 --> 00:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
participation I think one of my big
 
00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:58.730 align:start position:0%
participation I think one of my big
concerns

00:24:58.730 --> 00:24:58.740 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
00:25:01.549 --> 00:25:01.559 align:start position:0%
I think we can all stand behind the goal
 
00:25:05.330 --> 00:25:05.340 align:start position:0%
of uh improving quality
 
00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
my concern is who has the means to
 
00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:10.010 align:start position:0%
my concern is who has the means to
participate

00:25:10.010 --> 00:25:10.020 align:start position:0%
participate
 
00:25:12.649 --> 00:25:12.659 align:start position:0%
and so who gets to achieve that quality
 
00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:15.360 align:start position:0%
improvement so if we say one-fifth of
 
00:25:17.390 --> 00:25:17.400 align:start position:0%
the state is moving down this quality
 
00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:19.440 align:start position:0%
pathway four-fifths or not who is that
 
00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
four-fifths and who ends up underserved
 
00:25:25.010 --> 00:25:25.020 align:start position:0%
so I would really like to get a handle
 
00:25:28.549 --> 00:25:28.559 align:start position:0%
on how can we make this more equitable
 
00:25:30.649 --> 00:25:30.659 align:start position:0%
um you know I know that this that some
 
00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:32.640 align:start position:0%
centers in my area are participating and
 
00:25:36.169 --> 00:25:36.179 align:start position:0%
feeling very stretched by that others
 
00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:38.340 align:start position:0%
are not I've also heard of folks who are
 
00:25:41.149 --> 00:25:41.159 align:start position:0%
making decisions in order to participate
 
00:25:44.810 --> 00:25:44.820 align:start position:0%
like ending their Aftercare you know
 
00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
um so we're in order to achieve quality
 
00:25:50.029 --> 00:25:50.039 align:start position:0%
they're reducing capacity right that's
 
00:25:52.850 --> 00:25:52.860 align:start position:0%
not what we want exactly so I think
 
00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:54.720 align:start position:0%
um you know that a lot of my concerns
 
00:25:57.649 --> 00:25:57.659 align:start position:0%
are around that piece I think
 
00:26:00.049 --> 00:26:00.059 align:start position:0%
you know great like pyramid model great
 
00:26:02.450 --> 00:26:02.460 align:start position:0%
love it let's move folks down that
 
00:26:05.470 --> 00:26:05.480 align:start position:0%
pathway but who isn't who isn't able to
 
00:26:07.730 --> 00:26:07.740 align:start position:0%
participate and how do we ensure that
 
00:26:09.409 --> 00:26:09.419 align:start position:0%
that we can get those adoption numbers
 
00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
up so I would hope that in that scope of
 
00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:13.010 align:start position:0%
up so I would hope that in that scope of
work

00:26:13.010 --> 00:26:13.020 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:15.240 align:start position:0%
we're looking we're taking a hard look
 
00:26:17.570 --> 00:26:17.580 align:start position:0%
at that as well just putting that out
 
00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
that's a very valid point
 
00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:21.960 align:start position:0%
um so you touched on one of the things
 
00:26:24.769 --> 00:26:24.779 align:start position:0%
that in this um GNC procurement uh
 
00:26:26.510 --> 00:26:26.520 align:start position:0%
something that I have said
 
00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:28.200 align:start position:0%
um is an interest of mine that I hope we
 
00:26:30.529 --> 00:26:30.539 align:start position:0%
can get to for this committee which is
 
00:26:32.690 --> 00:26:32.700 align:start position:0%
expanding the access to online trainings
 
00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:34.130 align:start position:0%
expanding the access to online trainings
right

00:26:34.130 --> 00:26:34.140 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:36.480 align:start position:0%
um so one of my dreams to come out of
 
00:26:38.810 --> 00:26:38.820 align:start position:0%
this committee is to get it to where the
 
00:26:40.190 --> 00:26:40.200 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire is providing
 
00:26:42.529 --> 00:26:42.539 align:start position:0%
teachers with a pathway to a CDA for
 
00:26:42.539 --> 00:26:43.789 align:start position:0%
teachers with a pathway to a CDA for
free

00:26:43.789 --> 00:26:43.799 align:start position:0%
free
 
00:26:45.529 --> 00:26:45.539 align:start position:0%
um and that's coming from me
 
00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:48.360 align:start position:0%
so put that put that in your um put that
 
00:26:50.210 --> 00:26:50.220 align:start position:0%
in your pocket uh the reason I say that
 
00:26:51.470 --> 00:26:51.480 align:start position:0%
is because
 
00:26:53.210 --> 00:26:53.220 align:start position:0%
um if we have this money available and
 
00:26:55.010 --> 00:26:55.020 align:start position:0%
it can be used towards that and that's
 
00:26:56.510 --> 00:26:56.520 align:start position:0%
an increase in the quality of a teacher
 
00:26:57.950 --> 00:26:57.960 align:start position:0%
right a CDA is increasing the quality of
 
00:26:59.930 --> 00:26:59.940 align:start position:0%
a teacher right
 
00:27:01.730 --> 00:27:01.740 align:start position:0%
um that would be something that I'd like
 
00:27:03.710 --> 00:27:03.720 align:start position:0%
the department to look at because we're
 
00:27:06.529 --> 00:27:06.539 align:start position:0%
going to look at it in here because one
 
00:27:07.909 --> 00:27:07.919 align:start position:0%
of the issues that we have to do to
 
00:27:09.409 --> 00:27:09.419 align:start position:0%
solve the long-term supply problem is
 
00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:12.120 align:start position:0%
get more people to be lead teachers and
 
00:27:13.789 --> 00:27:13.799 align:start position:0%
the CDA at least in my experience the
 
00:27:15.649 --> 00:27:15.659 align:start position:0%
CDA is in which the vast majority of my
 
00:27:17.390 --> 00:27:17.400 align:start position:0%
teachers qualify to be a Lead Teacher
 
00:27:18.769 --> 00:27:18.779 align:start position:0%
plus obviously there are thousand hours
 
00:27:22.010 --> 00:27:22.020 align:start position:0%
of experience which is about six months
 
00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:23.090 align:start position:0%
of experience which is about six months
um

00:27:23.090 --> 00:27:23.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:25.850 --> 00:27:25.860 align:start position:0%
but that would be something that
 
00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
um would accomplish the other long-term
 
00:27:29.330 --> 00:27:29.340 align:start position:0%
dream that I have which is getting
 
00:27:32.090 --> 00:27:32.100 align:start position:0%
people out of high school ready to be a
 
00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
Lead Teacher within six months of
 
00:27:36.049 --> 00:27:36.059 align:start position:0%
graduating high school
 
00:27:38.570 --> 00:27:38.580 align:start position:0%
um so can is that part of that process
 
00:27:40.190 --> 00:27:40.200 align:start position:0%
can you can you take a look to see if
 
00:27:41.510 --> 00:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
that's a thing I know we already offer
 
00:27:43.610 --> 00:27:43.620 align:start position:0%
CTE to begin with
 
00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:46.430 align:start position:0%
CTE to begin with
um

00:27:46.430 --> 00:27:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:48.769 --> 00:27:48.779 align:start position:0%
various professional development
 
00:27:51.409 --> 00:27:51.419 align:start position:0%
opportunities uh what specifically
 
00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:54.480 align:start position:0%
they're for what the credentials are for
 
00:27:56.990 --> 00:27:57.000 align:start position:0%
we're also in the process of preparing
 
00:28:00.590 --> 00:28:00.600 align:start position:0%
to adopt rules for those credentials
 
00:28:08.769 --> 00:28:08.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
it really really or
 
00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:14.760 align:start position:0%
um you know birth through age 13 so that
 
00:28:19.310 --> 00:28:19.320 align:start position:0%
may limit your dream I'm not sure but
 
00:28:21.710 --> 00:28:21.720 align:start position:0%
it's only a dream if you have it
 
00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:22.490 align:start position:0%
it's only a dream if you have it
um

00:28:22.490 --> 00:28:22.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:25.310 --> 00:28:25.320 align:start position:0%
it's I I do believe and I've said before
 
00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
and I've said it in public interviews
 
00:28:29.510 --> 00:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
um you know there's short-term they're
 
00:28:31.909 --> 00:28:31.919 align:start position:0%
short-term medium-term and long-term
 
00:28:35.029 --> 00:28:35.039 align:start position:0%
problems that we have to fix this body
 
00:28:37.430 --> 00:28:37.440 align:start position:0%
has to fix obviously the supply the
 
00:28:40.549 --> 00:28:40.559 align:start position:0%
supply issue is the number one issue and
 
00:28:44.390 --> 00:28:44.400 align:start position:0%
I do view as a medium-term solution is
 
00:28:45.830 --> 00:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
getting the state especially they're
 
00:28:48.529 --> 00:28:48.539 align:start position:0%
already offering CTE online
 
00:28:51.049 --> 00:28:51.059 align:start position:0%
um and the cdas are by and large already
 
00:28:52.430 --> 00:28:52.440 align:start position:0%
offered online I think they're like four
 
00:28:55.610 --> 00:28:55.620 align:start position:0%
or five hundred bucks per individual
 
00:28:57.830 --> 00:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
which is not nothing but it's not
 
00:28:59.090 --> 00:28:59.100 align:start position:0%
let's be honest it's not going to
 
00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
bankrupt anybody either
 
00:29:02.149 --> 00:29:02.159 align:start position:0%
um not the state I mean not going to
 
00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:04.320 align:start position:0%
pick up the state I should say
 
00:29:07.490 --> 00:29:07.500 align:start position:0%
um so if if we could find a way while
 
00:29:09.529 --> 00:29:09.539 align:start position:0%
this program is being
 
00:29:12.049 --> 00:29:12.059 align:start position:0%
arguably underutilized
 
00:29:13.789 --> 00:29:13.799 align:start position:0%
um and about to go over an enhancement
 
00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
if there's a way to dovetail that in
 
00:29:18.169 --> 00:29:18.179 align:start position:0%
there that would be amazing and would
 
00:29:20.269 --> 00:29:20.279 align:start position:0%
stop me from having to go to my
 
00:29:22.370 --> 00:29:22.380 align:start position:0%
political bosses and say Hey I want X
 
00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:24.480 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars to develop a program
 
00:29:26.930 --> 00:29:26.940 align:start position:0%
so that people can go and become a
 
00:29:29.210 --> 00:29:29.220 align:start position:0%
teacher A Lead Teacher and then we can
 
00:29:31.970 --> 00:29:31.980 align:start position:0%
have all the providers of the CDA come
 
00:29:33.889 --> 00:29:33.899 align:start position:0%
out and Lobby against it and
 
00:29:36.350 --> 00:29:36.360 align:start position:0%
have that nasty Throwdown fight let me
 
00:29:38.330 --> 00:29:38.340 align:start position:0%
just provide you with a list and then if
 
00:29:40.970 --> 00:29:40.980 align:start position:0%
you would kindly let me know if you see
 
00:29:43.130 --> 00:29:43.140 align:start position:0%
what you're looking for on that
 
00:29:45.529 --> 00:29:45.539 align:start position:0%
um or not yeah I I would I would yeah
 
00:29:46.909 --> 00:29:46.919 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm specifically looking for
 
00:29:48.470 --> 00:29:48.480 align:start position:0%
is a way to get more people qualified as
 
00:29:50.389 --> 00:29:50.399 align:start position:0%
Lead Teacher through the CDA so that
 
00:29:52.130 --> 00:29:52.140 align:start position:0%
that's that's literally exactly what I'm
 
00:29:53.710 --> 00:29:53.720 align:start position:0%
looking for
 
00:29:56.930 --> 00:29:56.940 align:start position:0%
uh because that is the um
 
00:29:59.090 --> 00:29:59.100 align:start position:0%
you know they require these teachers are
 
00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:00.720 align:start position:0%
every teacher is required to a certain
 
00:30:02.450 --> 00:30:02.460 align:start position:0%
amount of CTE
 
00:30:04.610 --> 00:30:04.620 align:start position:0%
um I see no why I see no reason why an
 
00:30:06.230 --> 00:30:06.240 align:start position:0%
assistant teacher and Associate teacher
 
00:30:07.850 --> 00:30:07.860 align:start position:0%
couldn't have as part of the required
 
00:30:10.490 --> 00:30:10.500 align:start position:0%
CTE pursuing their CDA so they become a
 
00:30:12.409 --> 00:30:12.419 align:start position:0%
Lead Teacher so they can make more money
 
00:30:14.930 --> 00:30:14.940 align:start position:0%
and then expand so they're they're
 
00:30:16.549 --> 00:30:16.559 align:start position:0%
they're expanded right because they're
 
00:30:18.049 --> 00:30:18.059 align:start position:0%
now making you know anywhere from two to
 
00:30:19.370 --> 00:30:19.380 align:start position:0%
four dollars an hour more which is a big
 
00:30:19.380 --> 00:30:20.690 align:start position:0%
four dollars an hour more which is a big
raise

00:30:20.690 --> 00:30:20.700 align:start position:0%
raise
 
00:30:22.850 --> 00:30:22.860 align:start position:0%
um and then on top of that we are
 
00:30:24.409 --> 00:30:24.419 align:start position:0%
increasing the supply of allowable child
 
00:30:26.269 --> 00:30:26.279 align:start position:0%
care and say New Hampshire because the
 
00:30:28.070 --> 00:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
number one Supply issue occurs in the
 
00:30:29.269 --> 00:30:29.279 align:start position:0%
lead teacher position which you are
 
00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:31.440 align:start position:0%
required to have in every classroom
 
00:30:35.810 --> 00:30:35.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:38.029 --> 00:30:38.039 align:start position:0%
all right so there's my dream said out
 
00:30:40.789 --> 00:30:40.799 align:start position:0%
loud I guess not so quietly
 
00:30:42.409 --> 00:30:42.419 align:start position:0%
um I think we're approaching into this
 
00:30:44.510 --> 00:30:44.520 align:start position:0%
this uh by the way thank you so much for
 
00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:45.289 align:start position:0%
this uh by the way thank you so much for
just

00:30:45.289 --> 00:30:45.299 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:30:46.850 --> 00:30:46.860 align:start position:0%
sitting at that stage in the hot seat
 
00:30:49.010 --> 00:30:49.020 align:start position:0%
and having all those questions fired at
 
00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:49.909 align:start position:0%
and having all those questions fired at
you

00:30:49.909 --> 00:30:49.919 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:30:51.230 --> 00:30:51.240 align:start position:0%
um is any is anyone else from the
 
00:30:54.230 --> 00:30:54.240 align:start position:0%
committee have any other um of things uh
 
00:30:57.110 --> 00:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
for her on gsq
 
00:30:58.250 --> 00:30:58.260 align:start position:0%
all right well that will give you a
 
00:30:58.260 --> 00:30:59.810 align:start position:0%
all right well that will give you a
breather

00:30:59.810 --> 00:30:59.820 align:start position:0%
breather
 
00:31:06.649 --> 00:31:06.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:06.659 --> 00:31:07.190 align:start position:0%
 
thank you

00:31:07.190 --> 00:31:07.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:31:08.810 --> 00:31:08.820 align:start position:0%
um does anyone else wish to get up and
 
00:31:11.029 --> 00:31:11.039 align:start position:0%
speak to gsq
 
00:31:11.039 --> 00:31:17.529 align:start position:0%
speak to gsq
foreign

00:31:17.529 --> 00:31:17.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:20.930 --> 00:31:20.940 align:start position:0%
state your name for the record
 
00:31:23.210 --> 00:31:23.220 align:start position:0%
hi I'm Marianne barter I'm the chair of
 
00:31:24.409 --> 00:31:24.419 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Child Care advisory
 
00:31:26.210 --> 00:31:26.220 align:start position:0%
Council and the New Hampshire Child Care
 
00:31:27.889 --> 00:31:27.899 align:start position:0%
advisory Council has been involved in
 
00:31:31.010 --> 00:31:31.020 align:start position:0%
the Q the gsq system since the beginning
 
00:31:33.169 --> 00:31:33.179 align:start position:0%
we have been part of this very very
 
00:31:35.690 --> 00:31:35.700 align:start position:0%
lengthy decision-making process it was
 
00:31:37.549 --> 00:31:37.559 align:start position:0%
like 10 years in the making it was an
 
00:31:39.350 --> 00:31:39.360 align:start position:0%
incredibly long period And I would like
 
00:31:41.149 --> 00:31:41.159 align:start position:0%
to say that the mistakes that were made
 
00:31:42.889 --> 00:31:42.899 align:start position:0%
are probably very human mistakes we
 
00:31:44.330 --> 00:31:44.340 align:start position:0%
rolled it out at the wrong time this was
 
00:31:46.549 --> 00:31:46.559 align:start position:0%
a terrible time to roll it out and I
 
00:31:47.810 --> 00:31:47.820 align:start position:0%
wonder if the response would have been
 
00:31:49.070 --> 00:31:49.080 align:start position:0%
different if it had been rolled out in
 
00:31:51.230 --> 00:31:51.240 align:start position:0%
2018 but the document looked different
 
00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:54.480 align:start position:0%
in 2018. so I do think there has been a
 
00:31:56.690 --> 00:31:56.700 align:start position:0%
responsiveness to Providers
 
00:31:58.669 --> 00:31:58.679 align:start position:0%
um I think the timing was poor and I
 
00:32:00.110 --> 00:32:00.120 align:start position:0%
also think moving forward it's really
 
00:32:01.610 --> 00:32:01.620 align:start position:0%
important to have a quality document
 
00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
because it looks like more and more
 
00:32:05.510 --> 00:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
Federal funding will be coming to States
 
00:32:08.149 --> 00:32:08.159 align:start position:0%
through the the QRS system the quality
 
00:32:10.430 --> 00:32:10.440 align:start position:0%
rating system so that's hugely important
 
00:32:12.769 --> 00:32:12.779 align:start position:0%
to get this right I think for the child
 
00:32:14.750 --> 00:32:14.760 align:start position:0%
care advisory Council really our biggest
 
00:32:16.490 --> 00:32:16.500 align:start position:0%
push will be for decision making
 
00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:18.480 align:start position:0%
abilities so right now the
 
00:32:20.450 --> 00:32:20.460 align:start position:0%
decision-making ability lies with DHHS
 
00:32:23.630 --> 00:32:23.640 align:start position:0%
and that's a huge benefit for Doh DHHS
 
00:32:26.990 --> 00:32:27.000 align:start position:0%
but it's also a barrier too because they
 
00:32:28.190 --> 00:32:28.200 align:start position:0%
are in the hot seat when things like
 
00:32:30.769 --> 00:32:30.779 align:start position:0%
this happen when things happen go badly
 
00:32:32.750 --> 00:32:32.760 align:start position:0%
with the system so what we'd like to do
 
00:32:34.430 --> 00:32:34.440 align:start position:0%
is work in Partnership to make sure that
 
00:32:37.010 --> 00:32:37.020 align:start position:0%
we move on to a consensus or at least a
 
00:32:39.049 --> 00:32:39.059 align:start position:0%
majority rule so that the next levels
 
00:32:41.450 --> 00:32:41.460 align:start position:0%
that come out will have great provider
 
00:32:44.149 --> 00:32:44.159 align:start position:0%
input will have great state input and
 
00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
we'll come out with something that's
 
00:32:47.930 --> 00:32:47.940 align:start position:0%
really a workable document
 
00:32:49.250 --> 00:32:49.260 align:start position:0%
all right I want to dig into that
 
00:32:50.510 --> 00:32:50.520 align:start position:0%
because that was a bit of a bombshell
 
00:32:52.130 --> 00:32:52.140 align:start position:0%
hidden up there
 
00:32:53.810 --> 00:32:53.820 align:start position:0%
um you just asked for you basically just
 
00:32:55.549 --> 00:32:55.559 align:start position:0%
asked for rule making Authority yeah
 
00:32:57.110 --> 00:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
yeah oh sorry not necessarily rule
 
00:32:59.330 --> 00:32:59.340 align:start position:0%
making Authority I apologize but I I
 
00:33:00.830 --> 00:33:00.840 align:start position:0%
didn't say I didn't say the answer was
 
00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:02.710 align:start position:0%
didn't say I didn't say the answer was
no

00:33:02.710 --> 00:33:02.720 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:33:04.909 --> 00:33:04.919 align:start position:0%
you'll apart that
 
00:33:07.490 --> 00:33:07.500 align:start position:0%
um so let's let's let's back all that up
 
00:33:09.289 --> 00:33:09.299 align:start position:0%
um because I'm not at least speaking
 
00:33:10.850 --> 00:33:10.860 align:start position:0%
personally I'm not entirely opposed to
 
00:33:12.110 --> 00:33:12.120 align:start position:0%
that I'm sure DHS would probably have
 
00:33:13.730 --> 00:33:13.740 align:start position:0%
something to say about that
 
00:33:16.430 --> 00:33:16.440 align:start position:0%
um but that's okay that's why this is a
 
00:33:18.049 --> 00:33:18.059 align:start position:0%
political system and that's why we solve
 
00:33:19.730 --> 00:33:19.740 align:start position:0%
political differences
 
00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:20.330 align:start position:0%
political differences
um

00:33:20.330 --> 00:33:20.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:21.590 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:33:23.509 --> 00:33:23.519 align:start position:0%
there's the QRS system which is where
 
00:33:25.730 --> 00:33:25.740 align:start position:0%
the feds are Doling the money out of
 
00:33:28.549 --> 00:33:28.559 align:start position:0%
um and you are you are the child care
 
00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:30.840 align:start position:0%
advisory Council yes
 
00:33:32.930 --> 00:33:32.940 align:start position:0%
which is go ahead and
 
00:33:35.570 --> 00:33:35.580 align:start position:0%
um I I I know of you but just for
 
00:33:37.130 --> 00:33:37.140 align:start position:0%
everybody else here go ahead and
 
00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:39.000 align:start position:0%
elaborate on the child care advisory
 
00:33:40.610 --> 00:33:40.620 align:start position:0%
Council and the role that you wish it to
 
00:33:44.090 --> 00:33:44.100 align:start position:0%
play in the gsq in the QRS system
 
00:33:46.549 --> 00:33:46.559 align:start position:0%
so we're a legislatively enacted body
 
00:33:48.350 --> 00:33:48.360 align:start position:0%
and we have voting and non-voting
 
00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:51.480 align:start position:0%
members made up of child care providers
 
00:33:54.110 --> 00:33:54.120 align:start position:0%
State leaders
 
00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:55.669 align:start position:0%
State leaders
um there's

00:33:55.669 --> 00:33:55.679 align:start position:0%
um there's
 
00:33:58.549 --> 00:33:58.559 align:start position:0%
um people who receive child care
 
00:34:00.649 --> 00:34:00.659 align:start position:0%
services they are on the committee and
 
00:34:03.049 --> 00:34:03.059 align:start position:0%
really what we do is we are supposed to
 
00:34:05.110 --> 00:34:05.120 align:start position:0%
inform on anything that will
 
00:34:07.610 --> 00:34:07.620 align:start position:0%
impede the access and affordability of
 
00:34:11.050 --> 00:34:11.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:13.609 --> 00:34:13.619 align:start position:0%
my brain is flaring
 
00:34:17.510 --> 00:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
um so uh you said you are to inform on
 
00:34:18.589 --> 00:34:18.599 align:start position:0%
basically new things happening with
 
00:34:19.609 --> 00:34:19.619 align:start position:0%
child care
 
00:34:23.629 --> 00:34:23.639 align:start position:0%
who do you inform and we tell DHHS we
 
00:34:26.210 --> 00:34:26.220 align:start position:0%
have a report that we issue every year
 
00:34:28.430 --> 00:34:28.440 align:start position:0%
that goes to the house oversight
 
00:34:32.570 --> 00:34:32.580 align:start position:0%
committee we reported on that in April I
 
00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
believe April yeah in conjunction with
 
00:34:37.369 --> 00:34:37.379 align:start position:0%
DHHS and that's a really long process we
 
00:34:39.530 --> 00:34:39.540 align:start position:0%
get asked a lot of questions of that
 
00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:40.129 align:start position:0%
get asked a lot of questions of that
um

00:34:40.129 --> 00:34:40.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
but that it's state leaders it can be
 
00:34:44.810 --> 00:34:44.820 align:start position:0%
the governor we we're really can inform
 
00:34:46.550 --> 00:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
to anyone and they can take that and
 
00:34:49.430 --> 00:34:49.440 align:start position:0%
they can read it and they can do it they
 
00:34:50.869 --> 00:34:50.879 align:start position:0%
can hope they can frame it put on the
 
00:34:52.369 --> 00:34:52.379 align:start position:0%
wall but they don't have to actually do
 
00:34:54.589 --> 00:34:54.599 align:start position:0%
anything with it nope
 
00:34:56.570 --> 00:34:56.580 align:start position:0%
although I will say in the past our
 
00:34:58.849 --> 00:34:58.859 align:start position:0%
reports tend to lead to legislation so
 
00:35:00.589 --> 00:35:00.599 align:start position:0%
we've had lots of opportunities in the
 
00:35:02.030 --> 00:35:02.040 align:start position:0%
past be part of the legislative process
 
00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:03.470 align:start position:0%
past be part of the legislative process
yeah

00:35:03.470 --> 00:35:03.480 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:04.310 align:start position:0%
yeah
um

00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:06.650 --> 00:35:06.660 align:start position:0%
so this is an idea as you know and I've
 
00:35:09.470 --> 00:35:09.480 align:start position:0%
advocated from this seat before I
 
00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
personally believe that providers and
 
00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:13.130 align:start position:0%
personally believe that providers and
and

00:35:13.130 --> 00:35:13.140 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:35:15.530 --> 00:35:15.540 align:start position:0%
teachers and they basically take
 
00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
government put it over here put
 
00:35:18.410 --> 00:35:18.420 align:start position:0%
everybody else is affected by government
 
00:35:20.390 --> 00:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
over here I feel like these people over
 
00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
here do not have equal say an input into
 
00:35:25.010 --> 00:35:25.020 align:start position:0%
this process
 
00:35:26.569 --> 00:35:26.579 align:start position:0%
um that that's not a question that's
 
00:35:28.730 --> 00:35:28.740 align:start position:0%
just my personal feelings
 
00:35:28.740 --> 00:35:30.170 align:start position:0%
just my personal feelings
um

00:35:30.170 --> 00:35:30.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:32.690 --> 00:35:32.700 align:start position:0%
I have envisioned a world
 
00:35:36.170 --> 00:35:36.180 align:start position:0%
um where this group over here has equal
 
00:35:38.690 --> 00:35:38.700 align:start position:0%
Authority or even a negative a negative
 
00:35:40.550 --> 00:35:40.560 align:start position:0%
political Authority on the people over
 
00:35:42.170 --> 00:35:42.180 align:start position:0%
here yeah yeah I have the same vision
 
00:35:45.349 --> 00:35:45.359 align:start position:0%
yes we do have a version of that in
 
00:35:46.730 --> 00:35:46.740 align:start position:0%
government already in my other hat
 
00:35:48.829 --> 00:35:48.839 align:start position:0%
wearing election law uh in election law
 
00:35:50.089 --> 00:35:50.099 align:start position:0%
we have this thing called the ballot law
 
00:35:52.310 --> 00:35:52.320 align:start position:0%
Commission which is a legislative and
 
00:35:54.589 --> 00:35:54.599 align:start position:0%
active body composed of I think they
 
00:35:56.390 --> 00:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
have they have five people and four
 
00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:57.650 align:start position:0%
have they have five people and four
alternates

00:35:57.650 --> 00:35:57.660 align:start position:0%
alternates
 
00:36:01.069 --> 00:36:01.079 align:start position:0%
um and they get to decide things
 
00:36:03.710 --> 00:36:03.720 align:start position:0%
um so yeah I think it's something for
 
00:36:05.870 --> 00:36:05.880 align:start position:0%
this committee to consider given that we
 
00:36:07.490 --> 00:36:07.500 align:start position:0%
already have this legislative and active
 
00:36:09.470 --> 00:36:09.480 align:start position:0%
body that is composed of providers and
 
00:36:11.690 --> 00:36:11.700 align:start position:0%
other interested parties
 
00:36:12.950 --> 00:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
um I wouldn't give you rule making
 
00:36:14.870 --> 00:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
Authority that would be a little too
 
00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:15.650 align:start position:0%
Authority that would be a little too
much

00:36:15.650 --> 00:36:15.660 align:start position:0%
much
 
00:36:17.450 --> 00:36:17.460 align:start position:0%
um but maybe a negative rule-making
 
00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:18.770 align:start position:0%
um but maybe a negative rule-making
Authority

00:36:18.770 --> 00:36:18.780 align:start position:0%
Authority
 
00:36:20.870 --> 00:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
um might be something for the body to
 
00:36:22.910 --> 00:36:22.920 align:start position:0%
consider especially if it's coming from
 
00:36:24.530 --> 00:36:24.540 align:start position:0%
the legislator that way we don't have to
 
00:36:25.849 --> 00:36:25.859 align:start position:0%
perform things like special committees
 
00:36:27.710 --> 00:36:27.720 align:start position:0%
in the future or read the rule 62
 
00:36:29.569 --> 00:36:29.579 align:start position:0%
document that 52 document that comes out
 
00:36:31.310 --> 00:36:31.320 align:start position:0%
every Friday
 
00:36:33.589 --> 00:36:33.599 align:start position:0%
um and wonder if we have to go to uh
 
00:36:36.650 --> 00:36:36.660 align:start position:0%
jowcar uh to to stop something bad from
 
00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:37.609 align:start position:0%
jowcar uh to to stop something bad from
happening

00:36:37.609 --> 00:36:37.619 align:start position:0%
happening
 
00:36:39.890 --> 00:36:39.900 align:start position:0%
um so anyways that's it sounds like we
 
00:36:40.970 --> 00:36:40.980 align:start position:0%
should have served English on that I
 
00:36:42.410 --> 00:36:42.420 align:start position:0%
started to interrupt you um I just
 
00:36:43.970 --> 00:36:43.980 align:start position:0%
wanted to touch on that while you you
 
00:36:45.589 --> 00:36:45.599 align:start position:0%
allowed that grenade out there I've been
 
00:36:48.050 --> 00:36:48.060 align:start position:0%
thinking it but you said out loud so I
 
00:36:49.370 --> 00:36:49.380 align:start position:0%
want to be honest about the limitations
 
00:36:55.550 --> 00:36:55.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:57.950 --> 00:36:57.960 align:start position:0%
are a couple of child care programs but
 
00:37:00.650 --> 00:37:00.660 align:start position:0%
sometimes the chair is a state employee
 
00:37:04.849 --> 00:37:04.859 align:start position:0%
sometimes the chair may be a parent so
 
00:37:07.490 --> 00:37:07.500 align:start position:0%
um it's a very Democrat I I think it's a
 
00:37:09.770 --> 00:37:09.780 align:start position:0%
very Democratic group we never go out
 
00:37:11.569 --> 00:37:11.579 align:start position:0%
and say that we are support or against
 
00:37:13.130 --> 00:37:13.140 align:start position:0%
anything without talking to the group
 
00:37:16.790 --> 00:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
without getting a feel for um you know
 
00:37:19.010 --> 00:37:19.020 align:start position:0%
for example ratios will be something I
 
00:37:20.810 --> 00:37:20.820 align:start position:0%
don't have a great answer to that yet as
 
00:37:22.130 --> 00:37:22.140 align:start position:0%
child care advisory Council but after
 
00:37:23.690 --> 00:37:23.700 align:start position:0%
June 8th I will because that's our next
 
00:37:25.970 --> 00:37:25.980 align:start position:0%
meeting I'm sure so um but I just wanted
 
00:37:27.290 --> 00:37:27.300 align:start position:0%
to be aware of kind of the limitations
 
00:37:28.370 --> 00:37:28.380 align:start position:0%
of our
 
00:37:29.870 --> 00:37:29.880 align:start position:0%
I don't think that's a limitation that's
 
00:37:32.510 --> 00:37:32.520 align:start position:0%
what that's how political bodies work
 
00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:33.170 align:start position:0%
what that's how political bodies work
um

00:37:33.170 --> 00:37:33.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:34.970 --> 00:37:34.980 align:start position:0%
that's that's one of the uh it's one of
 
00:37:36.050 --> 00:37:36.060 align:start position:0%
the advantages you have is having a
 
00:37:37.310 --> 00:37:37.320 align:start position:0%
chair who has a degree in political
 
00:37:39.470 --> 00:37:39.480 align:start position:0%
philosophy which is totally and utterly
 
00:37:41.270 --> 00:37:41.280 align:start position:0%
worthless except for this specific
 
00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:42.890 align:start position:0%
worthless except for this specific
situation

00:37:42.890 --> 00:37:42.900 align:start position:0%
situation
 
00:37:46.069 --> 00:37:46.079 align:start position:0%
all right so that's your guys's take on
 
00:37:48.170 --> 00:37:48.180 align:start position:0%
QRS the rulemaking
 
00:37:50.569 --> 00:37:50.579 align:start position:0%
um if you had any changes I assume you
 
00:37:52.010 --> 00:37:52.020 align:start position:0%
guys as a body you're going to make
 
00:37:56.390 --> 00:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
suggestions on how to uh overhaul gsq
 
00:37:57.829 --> 00:37:57.839 align:start position:0%
um I assume that's a public document so
 
00:37:59.329 --> 00:37:59.339 align:start position:0%
we don't need to Hash that out right now
 
00:38:00.650 --> 00:38:00.660 align:start position:0%
I imagine
 
00:38:02.030 --> 00:38:02.040 align:start position:0%
um because you're going to do that as
 
00:38:04.310 --> 00:38:04.320 align:start position:0%
you're moving forward I am fully
 
00:38:05.390 --> 00:38:05.400 align:start position:0%
confident that we are going to come out
 
00:38:08.930 --> 00:38:08.940 align:start position:0%
with a document that serves our needs
 
00:38:10.849 --> 00:38:10.859 align:start position:0%
um all right with that with that uh as
 
00:38:12.230 --> 00:38:12.240 align:start position:0%
they say and talk here with that on that
 
00:38:13.910 --> 00:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
bombshell uh does anybody else have any
 
00:38:16.250 --> 00:38:16.260 align:start position:0%
other questions comments concerns for
 
00:38:18.589 --> 00:38:18.599 align:start position:0%
the uh just for the hearing nope all
 
00:38:20.150 --> 00:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
right anybody else wish to get up and
 
00:38:22.730 --> 00:38:22.740 align:start position:0%
speak to gsq
 
00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:24.970 align:start position:0%
speak to gsq
foreign

00:38:24.970 --> 00:38:24.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:26.990 --> 00:38:27.000 align:start position:0%
I hope I'm the first one to ever make a
 
00:38:28.910 --> 00:38:28.920 align:start position:0%
Top Gear reference in a New Hampshire
 
00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:31.730 align:start position:0%

good morning I'm Jackie Cowell from
 
00:38:36.050 --> 00:38:36.060 align:start position:0%
Early Learning New Hampshire
 
00:38:37.609 --> 00:38:37.619 align:start position:0%
um we're a Statewide non-profit
 
00:38:37.619 --> 00:38:38.930 align:start position:0%
um we're a Statewide non-profit
representing

00:38:38.930 --> 00:38:38.940 align:start position:0%
representing
 
00:38:40.970 --> 00:38:40.980 align:start position:0%
um both the interests of child care
 
00:38:42.770 --> 00:38:42.780 align:start position:0%
providers as well as the families they
 
00:38:42.780 --> 00:38:44.030 align:start position:0%
providers as well as the families they
serve

00:38:44.030 --> 00:38:44.040 align:start position:0%
serve
 
00:38:45.950 --> 00:38:45.960 align:start position:0%
um so I think
 
00:38:47.930 --> 00:38:47.940 align:start position:0%
um one thing that you know Marianne I
 
00:38:48.890 --> 00:38:48.900 align:start position:0%
got a quick question for you as you're
 
00:38:49.910 --> 00:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
walking out
 
00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:50.650 align:start position:0%
walking out
um

00:38:50.650 --> 00:38:50.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:54.470 --> 00:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
so on the you know when you read the RSA
 
00:38:56.930 --> 00:38:56.940 align:start position:0%
for the led the legislatively enacted
 
00:38:58.490 --> 00:38:58.500 align:start position:0%
Child Care advisory Council there is a
 
00:39:01.670 --> 00:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
seat for a representative
 
00:39:03.829 --> 00:39:03.839 align:start position:0%
um appointed by the speaker of the house
 
00:39:06.829 --> 00:39:06.839 align:start position:0%
and there is a seat for state senator uh
 
00:39:08.270 --> 00:39:08.280 align:start position:0%
Senator Becky Whitley's just been
 
00:39:10.069 --> 00:39:10.079 align:start position:0%
appointed to it but I don't think
 
00:39:11.690 --> 00:39:11.700 align:start position:0%
there's a state rep at this point is
 
00:39:11.700 --> 00:39:13.790 align:start position:0%
there's a state rep at this point is
there

00:39:13.790 --> 00:39:13.800 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:39:15.650 --> 00:39:15.660 align:start position:0%
oh great okay that wouldn't make sense
 
00:39:17.690 --> 00:39:17.700 align:start position:0%
it does make sense even though she's on
 
00:39:18.770 --> 00:39:18.780 align:start position:0%
the opposite party that would probably
 
00:39:21.589 --> 00:39:21.599 align:start position:0%
be my pick too 25 years of child care
 
00:39:22.910 --> 00:39:22.920 align:start position:0%
hard to uh
 
00:39:25.849 --> 00:39:25.859 align:start position:0%
hard to look that down yeah so anyway I
 
00:39:28.370 --> 00:39:28.380 align:start position:0%
just wanted to point that out but um so
 
00:39:31.069 --> 00:39:31.079 align:start position:0%
so in our capacity of early learning New
 
00:39:33.190 --> 00:39:33.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we've been sitting on the um
 
00:39:37.430 --> 00:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
qris gsq for years you know almost over
 
00:39:40.430 --> 00:39:40.440 align:start position:0%
a decade as well the task force and so
 
00:39:42.050 --> 00:39:42.060 align:start position:0%
it really
 
00:39:44.630 --> 00:39:44.640 align:start position:0%
um I am very pleased that you know
 
00:39:46.130 --> 00:39:46.140 align:start position:0%
you're looking at it but the fact that
 
00:39:48.650 --> 00:39:48.660 align:start position:0%
there is this process with DHHS now
 
00:39:50.329 --> 00:39:50.339 align:start position:0%
where there's going to be a revisit a
 
00:39:53.569 --> 00:39:53.579 align:start position:0%
revision together that they will change
 
00:39:55.370 --> 00:39:55.380 align:start position:0%
the advisory I think they also meet
 
00:39:58.010 --> 00:39:58.020 align:start position:0%
quarterly which you know again maybe
 
00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:01.200 align:start position:0%
they'll be meet more frequently really
 
00:40:03.770 --> 00:40:03.780 align:start position:0%
um the per so I used to sit on it for
 
00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:06.240 align:start position:0%
almost a decade and then not one member
 
00:40:07.790 --> 00:40:07.800 align:start position:0%
of our team Chris casterly from
 
00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:09.349 align:start position:0%
of our team Chris casterly from
Rochester

00:40:09.349 --> 00:40:09.359 align:start position:0%
Rochester
 
00:40:11.750 --> 00:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
um Child Care at the time was pointed to
 
00:40:13.849 --> 00:40:13.859 align:start position:0%
it for us
 
00:40:16.609 --> 00:40:16.619 align:start position:0%
um and her her feedback really to me has
 
00:40:17.990 --> 00:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
been it's more
 
00:40:20.030 --> 00:40:20.040 align:start position:0%
they're not really acting as an advisory
 
00:40:22.370 --> 00:40:22.380 align:start position:0%
Council they get on Zoom and they're
 
00:40:25.370 --> 00:40:25.380 align:start position:0%
told things and then the meeting ends so
 
00:40:26.930 --> 00:40:26.940 align:start position:0%
I think that's something that's going to
 
00:40:29.210 --> 00:40:29.220 align:start position:0%
be good to take a look at you know I
 
00:40:31.490 --> 00:40:31.500 align:start position:0%
know that I feel confident DHHS will
 
00:40:33.170 --> 00:40:33.180 align:start position:0%
take that seriously and figure it out
 
00:40:35.390 --> 00:40:35.400 align:start position:0%
and I loved your question about you know
 
00:40:37.250 --> 00:40:37.260 align:start position:0%
how are we communicating let's evaluate
 
00:40:40.670 --> 00:40:40.680 align:start position:0%
what really sinks in what people hear
 
00:40:43.490 --> 00:40:43.500 align:start position:0%
and in terms of money
 
00:40:46.670 --> 00:40:46.680 align:start position:0%
um in two I believe it was the budget
 
00:40:49.069 --> 00:40:49.079 align:start position:0%
session of 2017. it might be might have
 
00:40:51.349 --> 00:40:51.359 align:start position:0%
been 2019 I'll have to go back but
 
00:40:53.569 --> 00:40:53.579 align:start position:0%
Governor sununu put in six million
 
00:40:57.650 --> 00:40:57.660 align:start position:0%
dollars for at that time the qris system
 
00:40:59.270 --> 00:40:59.280 align:start position:0%
um with the idea there was two million
 
00:41:01.250 --> 00:41:01.260 align:start position:0%
in year one and six million in year two
 
00:41:03.170 --> 00:41:03.180 align:start position:0%
knowing it would go up to eight million
 
00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
governor sununu was on board with there
 
00:41:08.329 --> 00:41:08.339 align:start position:0%
being an eight million dollar allocation
 
00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
from state government for qris at that
 
00:41:14.750 --> 00:41:14.760 align:start position:0%
time it didn't pass it was put into hb2
 
00:41:17.030 --> 00:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
and it got taken out it didn't happen
 
00:41:19.130 --> 00:41:19.140 align:start position:0%
but governor sununu was on board with
 
00:41:21.230 --> 00:41:21.240 align:start position:0%
that and there was a really good formula
 
00:41:23.990 --> 00:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
of how to get to 8 million now it's true
 
00:41:26.510 --> 00:41:26.520 align:start position:0%
that people's full costs aren't covered
 
00:41:28.670 --> 00:41:28.680 align:start position:0%
but a lot of them were you know there
 
00:41:32.450 --> 00:41:32.460 align:start position:0%
were 250 I might be it might be 230.
 
00:41:35.950 --> 00:41:35.960 align:start position:0%
people in the QRS system back then
 
00:41:38.930 --> 00:41:38.940 align:start position:0%
230 were either license plus or
 
00:41:41.710 --> 00:41:41.720 align:start position:0%
accredited those are the two 32 or 30 um
 
00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:43.270 align:start position:0%
accredited those are the two 32 or 30 um
programs

00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:43.280 align:start position:0%
programs
 
00:41:47.390 --> 00:41:47.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:50.640 align:start position:0%
250 I believe it's almost half yeah and
 
00:41:52.970 --> 00:41:52.980 align:start position:0%
so um it really was this idea of being
 
00:41:54.589 --> 00:41:54.599 align:start position:0%
partners with the state going over and
 
00:41:56.329 --> 00:41:56.339 align:start position:0%
above licensing you know for the benefit
 
00:41:58.250 --> 00:41:58.260 align:start position:0%
of the program and the families and the
 
00:42:00.170 --> 00:42:00.180 align:start position:0%
kids of course number one but they were
 
00:42:01.130 --> 00:42:01.140 align:start position:0%
willing to do it because it was
 
00:42:03.290 --> 00:42:03.300 align:start position:0%
reasonable and they were a big part of
 
00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:06.720 align:start position:0%
developing it so in 2019 right before
 
00:42:09.290 --> 00:42:09.300 align:start position:0%
the pandemic hit you know a lot of us
 
00:42:11.930 --> 00:42:11.940 align:start position:0%
were we were in brown Auditorium talking
 
00:42:13.490 --> 00:42:13.500 align:start position:0%
about the ideas people were really
 
00:42:16.069 --> 00:42:16.079 align:start position:0%
excited about the changes then the
 
00:42:19.010 --> 00:42:19.020 align:start position:0%
pandemic hit then it all came out and it
 
00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
was different
 
00:42:22.190 --> 00:42:22.200 align:start position:0%
and so you know I think from the
 
00:42:24.530 --> 00:42:24.540 align:start position:0%
provider's perspective so again really
 
00:42:27.230 --> 00:42:27.240 align:start position:0%
glad that we're looking at this I was I
 
00:42:29.089 --> 00:42:29.099 align:start position:0%
think the 80 if you really dig deep into
 
00:42:30.530 --> 00:42:30.540 align:start position:0%
the 80 a lot of them are already
 
00:42:32.569 --> 00:42:32.579 align:start position:0%
accredited or there are they're sort of
 
00:42:34.310 --> 00:42:34.320 align:start position:0%
coming into the system automatically as
 
00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:36.240 align:start position:0%
a Head Start program Macy's got him
 
00:42:38.569 --> 00:42:38.579 align:start position:0%
halfway there you know they didn't have
 
00:42:40.550 --> 00:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
to do a lot of different things so so
 
00:42:42.290 --> 00:42:42.300 align:start position:0%
I'm glad and that's basically all I
 
00:42:44.630 --> 00:42:44.640 align:start position:0%
wanted to share with you and thank you
 
00:42:46.609 --> 00:42:46.619 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
00:42:48.470 --> 00:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
all right I think we've uh anyone else
 
00:42:50.690 --> 00:42:50.700 align:start position:0%
wish to speak to you uh Grant steps for
 
00:42:52.849 --> 00:42:52.859 align:start position:0%
Quality I do think Cora hoppy from
 
00:42:54.770 --> 00:42:54.780 align:start position:0%
Rochester's on her way or she's here
 
00:42:57.950 --> 00:42:57.960 align:start position:0%
she's walked in behind you I saw her
 
00:42:59.569 --> 00:42:59.579 align:start position:0%
she was hiding from me she's one of my
 
00:43:00.710 --> 00:43:00.720 align:start position:0%
favorite people
 
00:43:02.750 --> 00:43:02.760 align:start position:0%
oh I know I'm everywhere I appreciate
 
00:43:04.930 --> 00:43:04.940 align:start position:0%
you guys
 
00:43:06.890 --> 00:43:06.900 align:start position:0%
welcome if you could say your name for
 
00:43:08.150 --> 00:43:08.160 align:start position:0%
the record absolutely absolutely
 
00:43:10.069 --> 00:43:10.079 align:start position:0%
Coraline hoppy the extractor over at
 
00:43:10.079 --> 00:43:12.710 align:start position:0%
Coraline hoppy the extractor over at
Rochester

00:43:12.710 --> 00:43:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:15.470 --> 00:43:15.480 align:start position:0%
Trend to me uh I am here for the quality
 
00:43:16.910 --> 00:43:16.920 align:start position:0%
steps of success
 
00:43:18.950 --> 00:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
um Granite States
 
00:43:21.170 --> 00:43:21.180 align:start position:0%
thank you um right now we're licensed
 
00:43:22.670 --> 00:43:22.680 align:start position:0%
plus so we're starting to integrate into
 
00:43:23.990 --> 00:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
the system
 
00:43:27.170 --> 00:43:27.180 align:start position:0%
um we have a huge staff we have 94
 
00:43:30.410 --> 00:43:30.420 align:start position:0%
employees with us for us to get step two
 
00:43:32.450 --> 00:43:32.460 align:start position:0%
into the system it's an incredible
 
00:43:34.910 --> 00:43:34.920 align:start position:0%
amount of work I just recently got my
 
00:43:37.010 --> 00:43:37.020 align:start position:0%
credentials done and we're going through
 
00:43:40.430 --> 00:43:40.440 align:start position:0%
about 50 full-time staff so the process
 
00:43:43.370 --> 00:43:43.380 align:start position:0%
is very daunting just to even begin to
 
00:43:45.349 --> 00:43:45.359 align:start position:0%
look at and then with the current
 
00:43:48.530 --> 00:43:48.540 align:start position:0%
changes and losing license plus funding
 
00:43:50.450 --> 00:43:50.460 align:start position:0%
attached to that it's terrifying because
 
00:43:52.670 --> 00:43:52.680 align:start position:0%
we're not going to be ready to enter the
 
00:43:55.849 --> 00:43:55.859 align:start position:0%
system by the December date so losing
 
00:43:57.470 --> 00:43:57.480 align:start position:0%
thirty two thousand dollars of license
 
00:43:59.750 --> 00:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
plus funding would be devastating at
 
00:44:01.910 --> 00:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
this point to our agency because we're
 
00:44:04.250 --> 00:44:04.260 align:start position:0%
looking at a 500 000 deficit this year
 
00:44:06.770 --> 00:44:06.780 align:start position:0%
so based off of the grant fundings year
 
00:44:09.650 --> 00:44:09.660 align:start position:0%
prior and shrinking back down like it in
 
00:44:13.010 --> 00:44:13.020 align:start position:0%
wages increasing so right now turnover
 
00:44:16.190 --> 00:44:16.200 align:start position:0%
is extremely big like we have 10
 
00:44:18.589 --> 00:44:18.599 align:start position:0%
Workforce people leaving two full-time
 
00:44:21.470 --> 00:44:21.480 align:start position:0%
position three on maternity leave and a
 
00:44:23.089 --> 00:44:23.099 align:start position:0%
bunch of high schoolers normally
 
00:44:25.010 --> 00:44:25.020 align:start position:0%
turnover is okay I can handle that going
 
00:44:28.190 --> 00:44:28.200 align:start position:0%
into summer but I am losing 10 and I
 
00:44:29.569 --> 00:44:29.579 align:start position:0%
have to shrink my operating hours
 
00:44:32.930 --> 00:44:32.940 align:start position:0%
because I can't without raising my rate
 
00:44:34.910 --> 00:44:34.920 align:start position:0%
for my families be able to even
 
00:44:37.490 --> 00:44:37.500 align:start position:0%
withstand our operation right now so
 
00:44:39.230 --> 00:44:39.240 align:start position:0%
entering a system like this right now
 
00:44:41.510 --> 00:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
while the industry is in chaos is just
 
00:44:43.609 --> 00:44:43.619 align:start position:0%
going to set the system up for failure
 
00:44:45.370 --> 00:44:45.380 align:start position:0%
and I'm with
 
00:44:47.690 --> 00:44:47.700 align:start position:0%
DHHS I really want to partner and
 
00:44:50.510 --> 00:44:50.520 align:start position:0%
collaborate and just already providers
 
00:44:52.190 --> 00:44:52.200 align:start position:0%
are being pinned against parents I don't
 
00:44:53.390 --> 00:44:53.400 align:start position:0%
want to have to be pinned up against
 
00:44:57.530 --> 00:44:57.540 align:start position:0%
DHHS or even have my any funding taken
 
00:45:00.710 --> 00:45:00.720 align:start position:0%
away so really just you know not so much
 
00:45:02.809 --> 00:45:02.819 align:start position:0%
causing the system but looking at better
 
00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
ways to integrate the system that we
 
00:45:07.490 --> 00:45:07.500 align:start position:0%
currently have into another system
 
00:45:10.609 --> 00:45:10.619 align:start position:0%
so I um I I just wanted to let you guys
 
00:45:12.430 --> 00:45:12.440 align:start position:0%
know that I am here to help with that
 
00:45:16.010 --> 00:45:16.020 align:start position:0%
and if you have any questions moving
 
00:45:17.690 --> 00:45:17.700 align:start position:0%
forward to I can explain a little bit
 
00:45:19.790 --> 00:45:19.800 align:start position:0%
more but entering the system right now
 
00:45:22.309 --> 00:45:22.319 align:start position:0%
based off a three-year program like Jen
 
00:45:24.530 --> 00:45:24.540 align:start position:0%
legere had given in her letter we're
 
00:45:26.030 --> 00:45:26.040 align:start position:0%
looking at about two hundred thousand
 
00:45:28.849 --> 00:45:28.859 align:start position:0%
dollars in cost so I can subsidize a
 
00:45:30.109 --> 00:45:30.119 align:start position:0%
good chunk of that cost because we're
 
00:45:31.730 --> 00:45:31.740 align:start position:0%
very fortunate because of our doe
 
00:45:34.309 --> 00:45:34.319 align:start position:0%
program I'm already granted like brought
 
00:45:36.290 --> 00:45:36.300 align:start position:0%
in grant funding for that so I don't
 
00:45:38.930 --> 00:45:38.940 align:start position:0%
require the entire amount of funding to
 
00:45:40.609 --> 00:45:40.619 align:start position:0%
come back I don't expect the state to
 
00:45:42.890 --> 00:45:42.900 align:start position:0%
completely fund the quality but I can't
 
00:45:45.170 --> 00:45:45.180 align:start position:0%
pass that cost onto my families because
 
00:45:47.150 --> 00:45:47.160 align:start position:0%
currently our enrolled and we we have
 
00:45:49.550 --> 00:45:49.560 align:start position:0%
enrollment turnover now we lose about
 
00:45:51.710 --> 00:45:51.720 align:start position:0%
four weeks of Revenue every time we lose
 
00:45:54.349 --> 00:45:54.359 align:start position:0%
a family and when two of my employees
 
00:45:56.750 --> 00:45:56.760 align:start position:0%
left in their full-time staff they
 
00:45:58.370 --> 00:45:58.380 align:start position:0%
looked at me and said the whole reason
 
00:46:00.050 --> 00:46:00.060 align:start position:0%
we're leaving it's because it's like
 
00:46:01.849 --> 00:46:01.859 align:start position:0%
watching families and children drowned
 
00:46:04.849 --> 00:46:04.859 align:start position:0%
and we can't help them so we're already
 
00:46:06.710 --> 00:46:06.720 align:start position:0%
subsidizing enough for these families
 
00:46:09.770 --> 00:46:09.780 align:start position:0%
and child care providers so if we again
 
00:46:11.390 --> 00:46:11.400 align:start position:0%
enter into a system right now that's
 
00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
just not ready we're going to lose more
 
00:46:16.370 --> 00:46:16.380 align:start position:0%
providers to a a quality system which we
 
00:46:18.829 --> 00:46:18.839 align:start position:0%
we stand for we want to be quality and
 
00:46:20.990 --> 00:46:21.000 align:start position:0%
we expect quality and
 
00:46:22.490 --> 00:46:22.500 align:start position:0%
um but right now it's just not a good
 
00:46:24.050 --> 00:46:24.060 align:start position:0%
time to enter into a completely new
 
00:46:26.210 --> 00:46:26.220 align:start position:0%
system and keep changing it on us
 
00:46:29.390 --> 00:46:29.400 align:start position:0%
so um I thank you guys and if you have
 
00:46:32.270 --> 00:46:32.280 align:start position:0%
any questions sure um you're a private
 
00:46:33.950 --> 00:46:33.960 align:start position:0%
call from our conversation uh you're a
 
00:46:36.470 --> 00:46:36.480 align:start position:0%
non-profit provider right right correct
 
00:46:38.089 --> 00:46:38.099 align:start position:0%
um can you elaborate on why you're
 
00:46:40.970 --> 00:46:40.980 align:start position:0%
losing 32 000 oh well a good chunk of it
 
00:46:43.010 --> 00:46:43.020 align:start position:0%
right now is the attendance space
 
00:46:45.290 --> 00:46:45.300 align:start position:0%
um because of the stick and it you know
 
00:46:46.550 --> 00:46:46.560 align:start position:0%
dealing with covet a lot of that
 
00:46:48.770 --> 00:46:48.780 align:start position:0%
funding's taken away a lot of our
 
00:46:50.089 --> 00:46:50.099 align:start position:0%
funding when we were doing on last
 
00:46:52.790 --> 00:46:52.800 align:start position:0%
year's budget too was inflated so really
 
00:46:54.470 --> 00:46:54.480 align:start position:0%
coming in this year to figure out a real
 
00:46:56.690 --> 00:46:56.700 align:start position:0%
budget was hard and I'm a second year
 
00:46:59.089 --> 00:46:59.099 align:start position:0%
executive director so really even with
 
00:47:00.650 --> 00:47:00.660 align:start position:0%
accountants assistance Auditors
 
00:47:03.650 --> 00:47:03.660 align:start position:0%
assistants we really inflated
 
00:47:04.670 --> 00:47:04.680 align:start position:0%
um what we thought we were going to
 
00:47:06.890 --> 00:47:06.900 align:start position:0%
bring in but not to be said we had had
 
00:47:09.829 --> 00:47:09.839 align:start position:0%
huge surpluses last couple years so that
 
00:47:11.930 --> 00:47:11.940 align:start position:0%
offset will be okay we're going to be
 
00:47:14.270 --> 00:47:14.280 align:start position:0%
fine but if another agency is smaller
 
00:47:16.250 --> 00:47:16.260 align:start position:0%
than ours takes a gigantic hit like that
 
00:47:17.809 --> 00:47:17.819 align:start position:0%
they're not going to make it we will
 
00:47:19.370 --> 00:47:19.380 align:start position:0%
because we're strong and we have great
 
00:47:21.290 --> 00:47:21.300 align:start position:0%
community support and we're getting
 
00:47:22.670 --> 00:47:22.680 align:start position:0%
upgrades to buildings that are being
 
00:47:24.770 --> 00:47:24.780 align:start position:0%
funded through the city as a private
 
00:47:26.450 --> 00:47:26.460 align:start position:0%
provider they don't get accessing to
 
00:47:28.970 --> 00:47:28.980 align:start position:0%
that kind of funding so I'm seeing a
 
00:47:32.210 --> 00:47:32.220 align:start position:0%
deficit because of poor estimation and
 
00:47:35.210 --> 00:47:35.220 align:start position:0%
enrollment turnover and attendance base
 
00:47:45.730 --> 00:47:45.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:48.589 --> 00:47:48.599 align:start position:0%
because we lose it in December if we
 
00:47:51.050 --> 00:47:51.060 align:start position:0%
don't enter into the system
 
00:47:53.530 --> 00:47:53.540 align:start position:0%
we're being cut off from our funding
 
00:47:56.569 --> 00:47:56.579 align:start position:0%
you want to speak to that one
 
00:47:57.790 --> 00:47:57.800 align:start position:0%
it's all right
 
00:48:00.770 --> 00:48:00.780 align:start position:0%
Cora I'm sorry right if she answers that
 
00:48:01.970 --> 00:48:01.980 align:start position:0%
question yeah absolutely it's called
 
00:48:04.190 --> 00:48:04.200 align:start position:0%
Eugene Tom I'm still you guys know why I
 
00:48:05.390 --> 00:48:05.400 align:start position:0%
scheduled this at 10 am because I am not
 
00:48:11.829 --> 00:48:11.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:13.849 --> 00:48:13.859 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:48:16.069 --> 00:48:16.079 align:start position:0%
so our meeting with the governor's
 
00:48:18.349 --> 00:48:18.359 align:start position:0%
office one of the items that we did
 
00:48:21.230 --> 00:48:21.240 align:start position:0%
agree upon was that
 
00:48:21.240 --> 00:48:21.890 align:start position:0%
agree upon was that
um

00:48:21.890 --> 00:48:21.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:24.710 --> 00:48:24.720 align:start position:0%
although we are aiming to continue with
 
00:48:28.010 --> 00:48:28.020 align:start position:0%
gsq as the quality rating information
 
00:48:28.020 --> 00:48:30.290 align:start position:0%
gsq as the quality rating information
system

00:48:30.290 --> 00:48:30.300 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:48:32.630 --> 00:48:32.640 align:start position:0%
um while we conduct the evaluation while
 
00:48:35.270 --> 00:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
we go through all this process we are
 
00:48:37.849 --> 00:48:37.859 align:start position:0%
going to continue licensed plus so I
 
00:48:40.790 --> 00:48:40.800 align:start position:0%
hope that's good news for you Cora I
 
00:48:43.069 --> 00:48:43.079 align:start position:0%
found you 32 000 look at me all right
 
00:48:46.130 --> 00:48:46.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:49.370 --> 00:48:49.380 align:start position:0%
so I mean for those who you know are in
 
00:48:51.530 --> 00:48:51.540 align:start position:0%
that because we want to be able to
 
00:48:53.690 --> 00:48:53.700 align:start position:0%
address things fairly I think that was
 
00:48:55.550 --> 00:48:55.560 align:start position:0%
part of the decision that we want to be
 
00:48:58.069 --> 00:48:58.079 align:start position:0%
able to continue that for now
 
00:49:00.589 --> 00:49:00.599 align:start position:0%
we don't want people in both systems
 
00:49:02.870 --> 00:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
because that isn't fair
 
00:49:04.849 --> 00:49:04.859 align:start position:0%
um so if you are currently a license
 
00:49:07.730 --> 00:49:07.740 align:start position:0%
plus you want to stay there for now
 
00:49:09.710 --> 00:49:09.720 align:start position:0%
um and we'll have more information as we
 
00:49:13.190 --> 00:49:13.200 align:start position:0%
go along it will end at some point but
 
00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:14.210 align:start position:0%
go along it will end at some point but
um

00:49:14.210 --> 00:49:14.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:16.730 --> 00:49:16.740 align:start position:0%
for now this is
 
00:49:19.190 --> 00:49:19.200 align:start position:0%
really best for for everybody there you
 
00:49:21.050 --> 00:49:21.060 align:start position:0%
go see look at that
 
00:49:23.270 --> 00:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
all right good job DHS it was a gold
 
00:49:24.950 --> 00:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
star for the day
 
00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:27.309 align:start position:0%
star for the day
um

00:49:27.309 --> 00:49:27.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:31.010 --> 00:49:31.020 align:start position:0%
if we want to bring her back up or
 
00:49:32.990 --> 00:49:33.000 align:start position:0%
I think uh hey look your trip to Concord
 
00:49:36.230 --> 00:49:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:37.730 --> 00:49:37.740 align:start position:0%
um would anyone else like to speak to
 
00:49:41.089 --> 00:49:41.099 align:start position:0%
gsq before we um close this on down and
 
00:49:42.670 --> 00:49:42.680 align:start position:0%
get to what I'm sure is going to be the
 
00:49:47.210 --> 00:49:47.220 align:start position:0%
really unifying subject of ratios
 
00:49:49.010 --> 00:49:49.020 align:start position:0%
all right uh with that I'm going to move
 
00:49:52.490 --> 00:49:52.500 align:start position:0%
on to child care ratios
 
00:49:55.370 --> 00:49:55.380 align:start position:0%
um I'll kind of briefly committee on the
 
00:49:57.109 --> 00:49:57.119 align:start position:0%
research that I have done
 
00:50:00.470 --> 00:50:00.480 align:start position:0%
um my my personal thought process on it
 
00:50:04.069 --> 00:50:04.079 align:start position:0%
um and and and and we can go from there
 
00:50:06.109 --> 00:50:06.119 align:start position:0%
um so let me start off with uh I am not
 
00:50:08.150 --> 00:50:08.160 align:start position:0%
going to get supportive of any change to
 
00:50:10.150 --> 00:50:10.160 align:start position:0%
any ratio system that would in any way
 
00:50:13.250 --> 00:50:13.260 align:start position:0%
uh compromise the safety of a child so
 
00:50:15.170 --> 00:50:15.180 align:start position:0%
let me start off with that so if before
 
00:50:17.089 --> 00:50:17.099 align:start position:0%
somebody loves the bomb of it's going to
 
00:50:18.250 --> 00:50:18.260 align:start position:0%
be dangerous
 
00:50:21.050 --> 00:50:21.060 align:start position:0%
nobody's nobody on this board nobody on
 
00:50:22.010 --> 00:50:22.020 align:start position:0%
this committee is going to do anything
 
00:50:23.930 --> 00:50:23.940 align:start position:0%
that is dangerous
 
00:50:26.329 --> 00:50:26.339 align:start position:0%
um that being said
 
00:50:28.730 --> 00:50:28.740 align:start position:0%
um once again short-term middle term and
 
00:50:30.770 --> 00:50:30.780 align:start position:0%
long-term solutions to the child care
 
00:50:33.470 --> 00:50:33.480 align:start position:0%
supply crisis in state New Hampshire the
 
00:50:35.690 --> 00:50:35.700 align:start position:0%
only short-term solution is to look at
 
00:50:37.010 --> 00:50:37.020 align:start position:0%
the ratios
 
00:50:38.690 --> 00:50:38.700 align:start position:0%
that's it that's the only thing that you
 
00:50:40.010 --> 00:50:40.020 align:start position:0%
can do that we could literally change
 
00:50:42.290 --> 00:50:42.300 align:start position:0%
tomorrow that would immediately increase
 
00:50:44.210 --> 00:50:44.220 align:start position:0%
the supply of child care in state New
 
00:50:44.220 --> 00:50:45.530 align:start position:0%
the supply of child care in state New
Hampshire

00:50:45.530 --> 00:50:45.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:50:47.089 --> 00:50:47.099 align:start position:0%
you might refute that statement that
 
00:50:48.349 --> 00:50:48.359 align:start position:0%
there's nothing else that we could do
 
00:50:49.970 --> 00:50:49.980 align:start position:0%
that would change it tomorrow
 
00:50:49.980 --> 00:50:52.190 align:start position:0%
that would change it tomorrow
okay

00:50:52.190 --> 00:50:52.200 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:50:55.609 --> 00:50:55.619 align:start position:0%
yeah exactly just yes
 
00:50:55.619 --> 00:50:56.329 align:start position:0%
yeah exactly just yes
um

00:50:56.329 --> 00:50:56.339 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:58.849 --> 00:50:58.859 align:start position:0%
so that's why I wanted to bring this
 
00:51:01.549 --> 00:51:01.559 align:start position:0%
admittedly sensitive subject up because
 
00:51:03.770 --> 00:51:03.780 align:start position:0%
short-term media term and long-term
 
00:51:05.990 --> 00:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
Solutions so if you don't at least have
 
00:51:08.750 --> 00:51:08.760 align:start position:0%
a good faith honest conversation about
 
00:51:11.270 --> 00:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
the what I believe is the only potential
 
00:51:13.309 --> 00:51:13.319 align:start position:0%
short-term solution doesn't mean it's a
 
00:51:15.349 --> 00:51:15.359 align:start position:0%
forever Solution by the way
 
00:51:18.230 --> 00:51:18.240 align:start position:0%
um you're short changing the process
 
00:51:21.170 --> 00:51:21.180 align:start position:0%
so I don't have I I did go through and
 
00:51:24.589 --> 00:51:24.599 align:start position:0%
look through what other states do and
 
00:51:26.270 --> 00:51:26.280 align:start position:0%
specifically my work was based around
 
00:51:28.490 --> 00:51:28.500 align:start position:0%
infant and toddler care because that is
 
00:51:30.770 --> 00:51:30.780 align:start position:0%
where the particular crunch is based on
 
00:51:33.829 --> 00:51:33.839 align:start position:0%
the ratios you cannot compare apples to
 
00:51:35.270 --> 00:51:35.280 align:start position:0%
apples across all states because they
 
00:51:37.849 --> 00:51:37.859 align:start position:0%
don't all use the same age bands but you
 
00:51:40.849 --> 00:51:40.859 align:start position:0%
can get kind of an idea so from my
 
00:51:43.549 --> 00:51:43.559 align:start position:0%
research New Hampshire falls pretty much
 
00:51:45.710 --> 00:51:45.720 align:start position:0%
in the middle in terms of allowable
 
00:51:47.510 --> 00:51:47.520 align:start position:0%
Child Care ratios for infants and
 
00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:50.390 align:start position:0%
Child Care ratios for infants and
toddlers

00:51:50.390 --> 00:51:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:52.910 --> 00:51:52.920 align:start position:0%
so when you're dealing with specifically
 
00:51:55.730 --> 00:51:55.740 align:start position:0%
infants right the four to one ratio
 
00:51:57.710 --> 00:51:57.720 align:start position:0%
if you just go to Five to one will you
 
00:52:01.250 --> 00:52:01.260 align:start position:0%
immediately increase Supply by 25 you've
 
00:52:04.069 --> 00:52:04.079 align:start position:0%
also increased workload by 25 percent
 
00:52:06.710 --> 00:52:06.720 align:start position:0%
25 well by the way there are some states
 
00:52:08.510 --> 00:52:08.520 align:start position:0%
that do five to one
 
00:52:10.010 --> 00:52:10.020 align:start position:0%
um it doesn't mean it's right for New
 
00:52:11.450 --> 00:52:11.460 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it just means there are states
 
00:52:14.089 --> 00:52:14.099 align:start position:0%
that do five to one so one of the things
 
00:52:16.069 --> 00:52:16.079 align:start position:0%
that did intrigue me was what this
 
00:52:19.130 --> 00:52:19.140 align:start position:0%
Commonwealth of Massachusetts does
 
00:52:19.910 --> 00:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
um so the Commonwealth Massachusetts
 
00:52:22.730 --> 00:52:22.740 align:start position:0%
starts with a I always forget how to
 
00:52:24.230 --> 00:52:24.240 align:start position:0%
phrase this it's technically a higher
 
00:52:25.970 --> 00:52:25.980 align:start position:0%
ratio but we would feel as a lower ratio
 
00:52:27.950 --> 00:52:27.960 align:start position:0%
because one over three is technically
 
00:52:30.470 --> 00:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
bigger than one over four math we'll
 
00:52:32.030 --> 00:52:32.040 align:start position:0%
call it a lower ratio for the sake of
 
00:52:33.710 --> 00:52:33.720 align:start position:0%
all being on the same page so they start
 
00:52:35.510 --> 00:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
off with a one out of three infant Child
 
00:52:37.670 --> 00:52:37.680 align:start position:0%
Care ratio
 
00:52:39.109 --> 00:52:39.119 align:start position:0%
you wonder why childcare is more
 
00:52:41.390 --> 00:52:41.400 align:start position:0%
expensive Massachusetts there you go
 
00:52:43.309 --> 00:52:43.319 align:start position:0%
um the largest cost as a teacher you've
 
00:52:45.109 --> 00:52:45.119 align:start position:0%
just reduced that teacher's productivity
 
00:52:47.569 --> 00:52:47.579 align:start position:0%
by 25 right
 
00:52:48.890 --> 00:52:48.900 align:start position:0%
um so that's a problem one of the things
 
00:52:50.210 --> 00:52:50.220 align:start position:0%
that they do do that's interesting is
 
00:52:51.890 --> 00:52:51.900 align:start position:0%
when they put new teachers into the room
 
00:52:53.390 --> 00:52:53.400 align:start position:0%
right so that second teachers come into
 
00:52:56.630 --> 00:52:56.640 align:start position:0%
that room that ratio can get increased a
 
00:52:59.829 --> 00:52:59.839 align:start position:0%
little bit so it goes from one to three
 
00:53:03.890 --> 00:53:03.900 align:start position:0%
to basically two uh two over
 
00:53:06.589 --> 00:53:06.599 align:start position:0%
um seven right so what we would do in
 
00:53:07.730 --> 00:53:07.740 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire if we had a one to three
 
00:53:10.130 --> 00:53:10.140 align:start position:0%
ratio we would be two over six right in
 
00:53:11.390 --> 00:53:11.400 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts they go to two over seven
 
00:53:12.530 --> 00:53:12.540 align:start position:0%
they still don't get to where New
 
00:53:13.609 --> 00:53:13.619 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is which at that point be two
 
00:53:15.349 --> 00:53:15.359 align:start position:0%
over eight but it's an interesting
 
00:53:17.630 --> 00:53:17.640 align:start position:0%
system that I found to propose as a
 
00:53:21.049 --> 00:53:21.059 align:start position:0%
potential compromise of balancing safety
 
00:53:24.290 --> 00:53:24.300 align:start position:0%
not burning out teachers not doing a
 
00:53:25.849 --> 00:53:25.859 align:start position:0%
wholesale change that was my cryptic
 
00:53:27.010 --> 00:53:27.020 align:start position:0%
message about wholesale change
 
00:53:29.030 --> 00:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
representative page
 
00:53:32.930 --> 00:53:32.940 align:start position:0%
um but would but would have an immediate
 
00:53:36.109 --> 00:53:36.119 align:start position:0%
a potentially immediate impact on the
 
00:53:37.549 --> 00:53:37.559 align:start position:0%
supply of child care and state of New
 
00:53:39.170 --> 00:53:39.180 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so let's talk about what that
 
00:53:40.430 --> 00:53:40.440 align:start position:0%
means for infant care in the state of
 
00:53:41.329 --> 00:53:41.339 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
00:53:44.210 --> 00:53:44.220 align:start position:0%
it's a it's basically it's ratio it's
 
00:53:46.790 --> 00:53:46.800 align:start position:0%
ratio plus teachers minus one that's if
 
00:53:47.930 --> 00:53:47.940 align:start position:0%
you want to think about it ratio plus
 
00:53:50.870 --> 00:53:50.880 align:start position:0%
teachers minus one so if you one out of
 
00:53:52.549 --> 00:53:52.559 align:start position:0%
four would not change if you have one
 
00:53:54.170 --> 00:53:54.180 align:start position:0%
teacher in there
 
00:53:56.750 --> 00:53:56.760 align:start position:0%
Fork it four babies that does not change
 
00:53:59.030 --> 00:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
that stays exactly how it is now
 
00:54:00.890 --> 00:54:00.900 align:start position:0%
when that second teacher comes into that
 
00:54:03.049 --> 00:54:03.059 align:start position:0%
room there's two teachers in that room
 
00:54:05.870 --> 00:54:05.880 align:start position:0%
instead of going from two to eight right
 
00:54:07.849 --> 00:54:07.859 align:start position:0%
we'd go to two to nine
 
00:54:09.470 --> 00:54:09.480 align:start position:0%
not two to ten because that'd be one
 
00:54:11.210 --> 00:54:11.220 align:start position:0%
that would be one to five but two to
 
00:54:11.220 --> 00:54:12.470 align:start position:0%
that would be one to five but two to
nine

00:54:12.470 --> 00:54:12.480 align:start position:0%
nine
 
00:54:14.150 --> 00:54:14.160 align:start position:0%
and you can keep going up that now these
 
00:54:15.770 --> 00:54:15.780 align:start position:0%
inference rooms in my experience they're
 
00:54:17.210 --> 00:54:17.220 align:start position:0%
not huge right so there's not 50
 
00:54:19.430 --> 00:54:19.440 align:start position:0%
teachers in a room you're not gonna
 
00:54:21.530 --> 00:54:21.540 align:start position:0%
exploding right I think the most I've
 
00:54:22.790 --> 00:54:22.800 align:start position:0%
ever seen is like four teachers in an
 
00:54:25.130 --> 00:54:25.140 align:start position:0%
infant room uh after that it's
 
00:54:26.569 --> 00:54:26.579 align:start position:0%
not sure there are centers that do more
 
00:54:28.490 --> 00:54:28.500 align:start position:0%
than four but
 
00:54:30.349 --> 00:54:30.359 align:start position:0%
um that in my experience I'm not too
 
00:54:32.390 --> 00:54:32.400 align:start position:0%
many it makes my experience so that is
 
00:54:33.950 --> 00:54:33.960 align:start position:0%
what I wanted to
 
00:54:36.470 --> 00:54:36.480 align:start position:0%
um throw out there as something that to
 
00:54:37.970 --> 00:54:37.980 align:start position:0%
talk about and I know we won't bang on
 
00:54:39.770 --> 00:54:39.780 align:start position:0%
it too much today because I I'm
 
00:54:41.270 --> 00:54:41.280 align:start position:0%
springing on everybody but part of that
 
00:54:42.890 --> 00:54:42.900 align:start position:0%
is I wanted to do my due diligence
 
00:54:44.569 --> 00:54:44.579 align:start position:0%
before the naysayers came out and just
 
00:54:46.309 --> 00:54:46.319 align:start position:0%
said no no no
 
00:54:47.690 --> 00:54:47.700 align:start position:0%
um but I think people were expecting me
 
00:54:49.010 --> 00:54:49.020 align:start position:0%
to come out and say we're gonna go to
 
00:54:50.270 --> 00:54:50.280 align:start position:0%
one to five and I'm like no we're not
 
00:54:51.290 --> 00:54:51.300 align:start position:0%
gonna go to one of five because that
 
00:54:53.450 --> 00:54:53.460 align:start position:0%
that would be a little aggressive but I
 
00:54:54.470 --> 00:54:54.480 align:start position:0%
do think there's a big difference
 
00:54:56.329 --> 00:54:56.339 align:start position:0%
between increasing
 
00:54:59.809 --> 00:54:59.819 align:start position:0%
25 and increasing 12 and a half percent
 
00:55:01.250 --> 00:55:01.260 align:start position:0%
um and then that that rate of increase
 
00:55:02.750 --> 00:55:02.760 align:start position:0%
actually decreases as you get more
 
00:55:04.250 --> 00:55:04.260 align:start position:0%
teachers in there the biggest jump is in
 
00:55:05.930 --> 00:55:05.940 align:start position:0%
that first new teacher
 
00:55:08.809 --> 00:55:08.819 align:start position:0%
um so anyways that is what I'm exploring
 
00:55:10.849 --> 00:55:10.859 align:start position:0%
um that would put us still kind of in
 
00:55:11.930 --> 00:55:11.940 align:start position:0%
the middle
 
00:55:14.089 --> 00:55:14.099 align:start position:0%
um we wouldn't be Mississippi I think
 
00:55:16.130 --> 00:55:16.140 align:start position:0%
they were like one to six or something
 
00:55:18.530 --> 00:55:18.540 align:start position:0%
um but we also wouldn't be where we are
 
00:55:18.540 --> 00:55:19.309 align:start position:0%
um but we also wouldn't be where we are
now

00:55:19.309 --> 00:55:19.319 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:55:21.049 --> 00:55:21.059 align:start position:0%
um it would be an immediate wholesale
 
00:55:21.059 --> 00:55:21.950 align:start position:0%
um it would be an immediate wholesale
change

00:55:21.950 --> 00:55:21.960 align:start position:0%
change
 
00:55:25.790 --> 00:55:25.800 align:start position:0%
um here are the there are parts of it
 
00:55:27.950 --> 00:55:27.960 align:start position:0%
that I do not like the parts that I do
 
00:55:28.970 --> 00:55:28.980 align:start position:0%
not like is
 
00:55:31.190 --> 00:55:31.200 align:start position:0%
it has a little bit of chronic cronyism
 
00:55:32.750 --> 00:55:32.760 align:start position:0%
in it because if you don't have a room
 
00:55:35.150 --> 00:55:35.160 align:start position:0%
that's licensed for more than eight you
 
00:55:37.130 --> 00:55:37.140 align:start position:0%
can't take advantage of this right so
 
00:55:39.410 --> 00:55:39.420 align:start position:0%
you're only really benefiting centers or
 
00:55:41.390 --> 00:55:41.400 align:start position:0%
providers that have
 
00:55:43.430 --> 00:55:43.440 align:start position:0%
the physical capacity to hold more than
 
00:55:44.930 --> 00:55:44.940 align:start position:0%
eight so if they have done their due
 
00:55:46.430 --> 00:55:46.440 align:start position:0%
diligence and set up a room to only hold
 
00:55:48.589 --> 00:55:48.599 align:start position:0%
eight kids
 
00:55:50.750 --> 00:55:50.760 align:start position:0%
this doesn't help them so all those
 
00:55:52.730 --> 00:55:52.740 align:start position:0%
people will not benefit from that they
 
00:55:53.990 --> 00:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
would only benefit from a wholesale
 
00:55:55.430 --> 00:55:55.440 align:start position:0%
change assuming they're within the
 
00:55:57.349 --> 00:55:57.359 align:start position:0%
confines of the fire code we heard a lot
 
00:55:58.849 --> 00:55:58.859 align:start position:0%
about that
 
00:55:58.859 --> 00:55:59.809 align:start position:0%
about that
um

00:55:59.809 --> 00:55:59.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:01.069 --> 00:56:01.079 align:start position:0%
so that's one of the things I don't like
 
00:56:02.690 --> 00:56:02.700 align:start position:0%
because anybody who follows me knows
 
00:56:04.069 --> 00:56:04.079 align:start position:0%
that I hate the government picking
 
00:56:05.809 --> 00:56:05.819 align:start position:0%
winners and losers
 
00:56:08.510 --> 00:56:08.520 align:start position:0%
um it's just it's just not fair
 
00:56:09.829 --> 00:56:09.839 align:start position:0%
um however we have to do something that
 
00:56:11.569 --> 00:56:11.579 align:start position:0%
would help so this is something that I I
 
00:56:13.609 --> 00:56:13.619 align:start position:0%
looked at in the short term
 
00:56:15.530 --> 00:56:15.540 align:start position:0%
um I definitely want to look at it for
 
00:56:18.049 --> 00:56:18.059 align:start position:0%
infants and toddlers specifically the
 
00:56:20.690 --> 00:56:20.700 align:start position:0%
child care crunch is a little less felt
 
00:56:22.370 --> 00:56:22.380 align:start position:0%
um in that three in age upgroup just
 
00:56:23.690 --> 00:56:23.700 align:start position:0%
because the ratios
 
00:56:25.569 --> 00:56:25.579 align:start position:0%
do get bigger there
 
00:56:28.790 --> 00:56:28.800 align:start position:0%
and profit-based centers prioritize
 
00:56:30.109 --> 00:56:30.119 align:start position:0%
those because that's where they make
 
00:56:31.910 --> 00:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
their money they don't make the money on
 
00:56:33.770 --> 00:56:33.780 align:start position:0%
infants and toddler cares um the infant
 
00:56:36.230 --> 00:56:36.240 align:start position:0%
toddler care in the profit-based child
 
00:56:38.030 --> 00:56:38.040 align:start position:0%
care model infinite toddler here in say
 
00:56:39.410 --> 00:56:39.420 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is all about getting them
 
00:56:41.150 --> 00:56:41.160 align:start position:0%
into the three and up room where they do
 
00:56:42.770 --> 00:56:42.780 align:start position:0%
start making money
 
00:56:42.780 --> 00:56:43.430 align:start position:0%
start making money
um

00:56:43.430 --> 00:56:43.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:45.109 --> 00:56:45.119 align:start position:0%
so anyways that's my thought process
 
00:56:47.030 --> 00:56:47.040 align:start position:0%
that was my initial when I want to talk
 
00:56:48.349 --> 00:56:48.359 align:start position:0%
about ratios that's what I want to talk
 
00:56:50.210 --> 00:56:50.220 align:start position:0%
about I gave it the name of dynamic
 
00:56:52.849 --> 00:56:52.859 align:start position:0%
ratios if somebody has a better name for
 
00:56:52.859 --> 00:56:53.510 align:start position:0%
ratios if somebody has a better name for
it

00:56:53.510 --> 00:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:56:55.069 --> 00:56:55.079 align:start position:0%
um that's it but that's what I wanted to
 
00:56:57.410 --> 00:56:57.420 align:start position:0%
talk about I think that's a ballot a um
 
00:56:59.750 --> 00:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
a balance
 
00:57:02.569 --> 00:57:02.579 align:start position:0%
questions comments concerns
 
00:57:07.670 --> 00:57:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:07.680 --> 00:57:08.809 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:57:08.809 --> 00:57:08.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:08.819 --> 00:57:11.329 align:start position:0%
um
yes

00:57:11.329 --> 00:57:11.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:14.569 --> 00:57:14.579 align:start position:0%
you just sit there it's okay MJ
 
00:57:16.609 --> 00:57:16.619 align:start position:0%
hi again I'm Jackie Cowell from Early
 
00:57:17.990 --> 00:57:18.000 align:start position:0%
Learning New Hampshire
 
00:57:19.910 --> 00:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
um so what were you thinking about with
 
00:57:22.250 --> 00:57:22.260 align:start position:0%
toddlers so it's the same thing it's
 
00:57:25.549 --> 00:57:25.559 align:start position:0%
plus one teachers it's uh yeah ratio
 
00:57:27.349 --> 00:57:27.359 align:start position:0%
plus teacher is minus one the reason you
 
00:57:28.609 --> 00:57:28.619 align:start position:0%
do the minus one is so that the
 
00:57:31.609 --> 00:57:31.619 align:start position:0%
underlying value doesn't change gotcha
 
00:57:33.890 --> 00:57:33.900 align:start position:0%
gotcha question um do you know what main
 
00:57:35.990 --> 00:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
from you mentioned Massachusetts what
 
00:57:38.569 --> 00:57:38.579 align:start position:0%
Maine and our and Vermont are as well I
 
00:57:40.849 --> 00:57:40.859 align:start position:0%
just wondered about teachers Crossing
 
00:57:43.309 --> 00:57:43.319 align:start position:0%
because they have too many kids yep um
 
00:57:46.130 --> 00:57:46.140 align:start position:0%
so I I if I remember we were basically
 
00:57:47.750 --> 00:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
this I want to say we were almost the
 
00:57:51.410 --> 00:57:51.420 align:start position:0%
same as Maine oh thank you um I I looked
 
00:57:54.109 --> 00:57:54.119 align:start position:0%
at all 50 states so I didn't just she's
 
00:57:56.210 --> 00:57:56.220 align:start position:0%
got it look at that yes you want to ship
 
00:57:58.309 --> 00:57:58.319 align:start position:0%
it around
 
00:58:00.470 --> 00:58:00.480 align:start position:0%
thank you I can't read it with my eyes
 
00:58:04.010 --> 00:58:04.020 align:start position:0%
but I don't have my glasses
 
00:58:05.690 --> 00:58:05.700 align:start position:0%
you might be able to read it
 
00:58:05.700 --> 00:58:07.190 align:start position:0%
you might be able to read it
yeah

00:58:07.190 --> 00:58:07.200 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:58:09.109 --> 00:58:09.119 align:start position:0%
and I was glad you mentioned burnout
 
00:58:11.930 --> 00:58:11.940 align:start position:0%
because that was that was a concern is
 
00:58:14.089 --> 00:58:14.099 align:start position:0%
that you know
 
00:58:15.770 --> 00:58:15.780 align:start position:0%
I end up
 
00:58:17.930 --> 00:58:17.940 align:start position:0%
with with teachers no worries
 
00:58:21.170 --> 00:58:21.180 align:start position:0%
um so as it pertains to burnout
 
00:58:22.309 --> 00:58:22.319 align:start position:0%
um because I knew this was going to be
 
00:58:23.750 --> 00:58:23.760 align:start position:0%
an issue sure
 
00:58:25.730 --> 00:58:25.740 align:start position:0%
um I I did my due diligence and I asked
 
00:58:28.010 --> 00:58:28.020 align:start position:0%
my own teachers yeah what would you do
 
00:58:29.510 --> 00:58:29.520 align:start position:0%
if right
 
00:58:31.730 --> 00:58:31.740 align:start position:0%
um so I propose something I well I
 
00:58:33.349 --> 00:58:33.359 align:start position:0%
didn't propose the dynamic ratio to them
 
00:58:35.089 --> 00:58:35.099 align:start position:0%
because they didn't want to spend 30
 
00:58:36.950 --> 00:58:36.960 align:start position:0%
minutes explaining it to them
 
00:58:39.230 --> 00:58:39.240 align:start position:0%
um but what I did essay was how would
 
00:58:40.609 --> 00:58:40.619 align:start position:0%
you feel if you took on specifically to
 
00:58:41.990 --> 00:58:42.000 align:start position:0%
my infant teachers how would you feel if
 
00:58:43.309 --> 00:58:43.319 align:start position:0%
you had if you had a fifth kid in this
 
00:58:51.430 --> 00:58:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:53.630 --> 00:58:53.640 align:start position:0%
right the teacher would get paid more
 
00:58:55.309 --> 00:58:55.319 align:start position:0%
because that's where you would put that
 
00:58:57.289 --> 00:58:57.299 align:start position:0%
extra that's as a provider that's where
 
00:58:58.490 --> 00:58:58.500 align:start position:0%
I would put it right
 
00:59:00.289 --> 00:59:00.299 align:start position:0%
um because you just increased from a
 
00:59:01.910 --> 00:59:01.920 align:start position:0%
profit from I can't speak for the
 
00:59:03.829 --> 00:59:03.839 align:start position:0%
non-profit world I don't operate the
 
00:59:06.289 --> 00:59:06.299 align:start position:0%
nonprofit world but in the profit world
 
00:59:09.109 --> 00:59:09.119 align:start position:0%
right yeah we would we would reward that
 
00:59:11.030 --> 00:59:11.040 align:start position:0%
work right right and you'd be amazed
 
00:59:12.650 --> 00:59:12.660 align:start position:0%
they're like oh that sounds great
 
00:59:15.950 --> 00:59:15.960 align:start position:0%
so I I you know you would if teacher
 
00:59:17.990 --> 00:59:18.000 align:start position:0%
burnout the way I look at my broader
 
00:59:20.750 --> 00:59:20.760 align:start position:0%
statement on teacher burnout is that it
 
00:59:22.970 --> 00:59:22.980 align:start position:0%
is only a concern of the state if it any
 
00:59:25.730 --> 00:59:25.740 align:start position:0%
which way compromises safety right if it
 
00:59:28.069 --> 00:59:28.079 align:start position:0%
is about you know keeping teachers happy
 
00:59:30.049 --> 00:59:30.059 align:start position:0%
or that sort of stuff that is a problem
 
00:59:32.569 --> 00:59:32.579 align:start position:0%
of the provider that's the provider's
 
00:59:34.849 --> 00:59:34.859 align:start position:0%
job and we see that with benefits and
 
00:59:36.770 --> 00:59:36.780 align:start position:0%
hours and stability and all sorts of
 
00:59:38.690 --> 00:59:38.700 align:start position:0%
other things right the the only in my
 
00:59:40.130 --> 00:59:40.140 align:start position:0%
personal opinion the only time the state
 
00:59:41.990 --> 00:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
is concerned is if it's a safety issue
 
00:59:43.730 --> 00:59:43.740 align:start position:0%
so if the teacher is burned out and
 
00:59:46.490 --> 00:59:46.500 align:start position:0%
that's creating a safety issue that's a
 
00:59:48.410 --> 00:59:48.420 align:start position:0%
different story right if the teachers
 
00:59:50.329 --> 00:59:50.339 align:start position:0%
burned out and you know
 
00:59:52.730 --> 00:59:52.740 align:start position:0%
yeah they just have a glass of wine on
 
00:59:55.130 --> 00:59:55.140 align:start position:0%
Friday night you know that's that's a
 
00:59:56.809 --> 00:59:56.819 align:start position:0%
provider issue right
 
00:59:59.030 --> 00:59:59.040 align:start position:0%
um so it is a it's but that's why we
 
01:00:00.349 --> 01:00:00.359 align:start position:0%
have to talk about it right nothing's
 
01:00:03.349 --> 01:00:03.359 align:start position:0%
nothing is set in stone sure and so we
 
01:00:04.849 --> 01:00:04.859 align:start position:0%
did a we do oh they have the
 
01:00:07.309 --> 01:00:07.319 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts system on here I'm not
 
01:00:09.049 --> 01:00:09.059 align:start position:0%
crazy I am crazy just not in the street
 
01:00:09.059 --> 01:00:10.010 align:start position:0%
crazy I am crazy just not in the street
right

01:00:10.010 --> 01:00:10.020 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:00:13.069 --> 01:00:13.079 align:start position:0%
and every two weeks or twice a month we
 
01:00:14.750 --> 01:00:14.760 align:start position:0%
do a large Zoom call with the Child Care
 
01:00:16.069 --> 01:00:16.079 align:start position:0%
Community I've mentioned it before about
 
01:00:18.829 --> 01:00:18.839 align:start position:0%
100 or so providers show up and so we
 
01:00:20.329 --> 01:00:20.339 align:start position:0%
did an independent poll knowing this
 
01:00:21.890 --> 01:00:21.900 align:start position:0%
hearing was coming just really quickly
 
01:00:25.010 --> 01:00:25.020 align:start position:0%
asking people and 73 they didn't want
 
01:00:26.809 --> 01:00:26.819 align:start position:0%
did just said they did they weren't
 
01:00:29.510 --> 01:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
looking to change ratios 27 said they
 
01:00:31.849 --> 01:00:31.859 align:start position:0%
did so I think you know once you have a
 
01:00:34.670 --> 01:00:34.680 align:start position:0%
real good clear proposal we can put it
 
01:00:36.770 --> 01:00:36.780 align:start position:0%
back out and just see what the provider
 
01:00:39.049 --> 01:00:39.059 align:start position:0%
Community I mean you know weighs in what
 
01:00:41.870 --> 01:00:41.880 align:start position:0%
they're you know correct
 
01:00:43.370 --> 01:00:43.380 align:start position:0%
um and you have to once again it's going
 
01:00:44.510 --> 01:00:44.520 align:start position:0%
to be
 
01:00:46.010 --> 01:00:46.020 align:start position:0%
each of those are going to be different
 
01:00:49.010 --> 01:00:49.020 align:start position:0%
because if they have a you know if they
 
01:00:50.089 --> 01:00:50.099 align:start position:0%
have a room that can only hold eight
 
01:00:51.770 --> 01:00:51.780 align:start position:0%
they're not going to support going to
 
01:00:53.990 --> 01:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
two to nine right because they're just
 
01:00:55.490 --> 01:00:55.500 align:start position:0%
missing out
 
01:00:57.829 --> 01:00:57.839 align:start position:0%
um but it's that's why I've held back on
 
01:00:59.030 --> 01:00:59.040 align:start position:0%
this because I think everybody thought I
 
01:01:00.170 --> 01:01:00.180 align:start position:0%
was just going to say increase the
 
01:01:02.510 --> 01:01:02.520 align:start position:0%
ratios no other conversation but I'm
 
01:01:04.730 --> 01:01:04.740 align:start position:0%
smarter than that Paige I'm smarter than
 
01:01:04.740 --> 01:01:06.829 align:start position:0%
smarter than that Paige I'm smarter than
that

01:01:06.829 --> 01:01:06.839 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:01:06.839 --> 01:01:08.530 align:start position:0%
that
um

01:01:08.530 --> 01:01:08.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:11.030 --> 01:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
he says he's smarter than that he knows
 
01:01:12.230 --> 01:01:12.240 align:start position:0%
I know what the opposition is going to
 
01:01:13.609 --> 01:01:13.619 align:start position:0%
be you know part of being good in
 
01:01:14.690 --> 01:01:14.700 align:start position:0%
politics is knowing your opposition is
 
01:01:15.650 --> 01:01:15.660 align:start position:0%
going to say before they're going to say
 
01:01:16.849 --> 01:01:16.859 align:start position:0%
it right
 
01:01:18.589 --> 01:01:18.599 align:start position:0%
um yeah we were just trying to give you
 
01:01:20.030 --> 01:01:20.040 align:start position:0%
information what the providers were
 
01:01:21.589 --> 01:01:21.599 align:start position:0%
asking for yeah
 
01:01:21.599 --> 01:01:22.370 align:start position:0%
asking for yeah
um

01:01:22.370 --> 01:01:22.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:24.170 --> 01:01:24.180 align:start position:0%
any other things you'd like to apply any
 
01:01:24.180 --> 01:01:26.990 align:start position:0%
any other things you'd like to apply any
questions

01:01:26.990 --> 01:01:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:29.329 --> 01:01:29.339 align:start position:0%
when is your next meeting pardon when
 
01:01:31.309 --> 01:01:31.319 align:start position:0%
it's the next meeting yeah so you guys
 
01:01:33.829 --> 01:01:33.839 align:start position:0%
are welcome to come it's the second and
 
01:01:36.109 --> 01:01:36.119 align:start position:0%
fourth Thursdays of the month from 1 to
 
01:01:38.930 --> 01:01:38.940 align:start position:0%
2 30 on Zoom
 
01:01:40.490 --> 01:01:40.500 align:start position:0%
except for the child care advisory
 
01:01:43.730 --> 01:01:43.740 align:start position:0%
Council which it takes the uh for the
 
01:01:45.289 --> 01:01:45.299 align:start position:0%
second second
 
01:01:47.450 --> 01:01:47.460 align:start position:0%
um Thursday in the even months so the
 
01:01:49.849 --> 01:01:49.859 align:start position:0%
next one coming up is June 8th next week
 
01:01:51.950 --> 01:01:51.960 align:start position:0%
that's the child care advisory where
 
01:01:54.109 --> 01:01:54.119 align:start position:0%
voting members are required to be in
 
01:01:56.030 --> 01:01:56.040 align:start position:0%
person and the rest can come either in
 
01:01:57.890 --> 01:01:57.900 align:start position:0%
person or by soon
 
01:02:01.130 --> 01:02:01.140 align:start position:0%
second and third second fourth so I
 
01:02:01.140 --> 01:02:01.970 align:start position:0%
second and third second fourth so I
wonder

01:02:01.970 --> 01:02:01.980 align:start position:0%
wonder
 
01:02:04.010 --> 01:02:04.020 align:start position:0%
if we could
 
01:02:06.109 --> 01:02:06.119 align:start position:0%
try to put some more meat on these bones
 
01:02:08.270 --> 01:02:08.280 align:start position:0%
and just ship it over to them let's see
 
01:02:10.010 --> 01:02:10.020 align:start position:0%
what they think you know I mean see if
 
01:02:12.349 --> 01:02:12.359 align:start position:0%
those numbers shift from 27 up I think
 
01:02:14.990 --> 01:02:15.000 align:start position:0%
that would be interesting sure yeah it's
 
01:02:16.490 --> 01:02:16.500 align:start position:0%
it's uh said it's not give them
 
01:02:17.950 --> 01:02:17.960 align:start position:0%
something concrete rather than just
 
01:02:20.390 --> 01:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
trying to find a middle ground here that
 
01:02:22.490 --> 01:02:22.500 align:start position:0%
uh won't uh compromise safety won't
 
01:02:24.650 --> 01:02:24.660 align:start position:0%
create teacher to burn out won't uh and
 
01:02:26.030 --> 01:02:26.040 align:start position:0%
just from having work in the infant room
 
01:02:27.349 --> 01:02:27.359 align:start position:0%
myself for some reason that's the room
 
01:02:31.730 --> 01:02:31.740 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:34.010 --> 01:02:34.020 align:start position:0%
uh I will say yeah five kids would be a
 
01:02:35.630 --> 01:02:35.640 align:start position:0%
lot but uh when you've got that second
 
01:02:37.069 --> 01:02:37.079 align:start position:0%
teacher in there nine doesn't seem so
 
01:02:40.069 --> 01:02:40.079 align:start position:0%
bad Idaho used to have one to eleven oh
 
01:02:42.549 --> 01:02:42.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:44.690 --> 01:02:44.700 align:start position:0%
what fire drill how are you gonna do
 
01:02:46.670 --> 01:02:46.680 align:start position:0%
that oh yeah that that teacher needs to
 
01:02:50.569 --> 01:02:50.579 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:52.010 --> 01:02:52.020 align:start position:0%
they're not going to sit down
 
01:02:52.020 --> 01:02:53.630 align:start position:0%
they're not going to sit down
representation

01:02:53.630 --> 01:02:53.640 align:start position:0%
representation
 
01:02:56.089 --> 01:02:56.099 align:start position:0%
yeah um so I just know when you Advanced
 
01:02:58.370 --> 01:02:58.380 align:start position:0%
uh the possibility of changing
 
01:02:59.809 --> 01:02:59.819 align:start position:0%
all we heard from a lot of providers
 
01:03:03.349 --> 01:03:03.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:04.970 --> 01:03:04.980 align:start position:0%
um could you tell us like a little bit
 
01:03:07.130 --> 01:03:07.140 align:start position:0%
more about how the ratios were developed
 
01:03:09.289 --> 01:03:09.299 align:start position:0%
and kind of how
 
01:03:11.990 --> 01:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
sure and again there's there's sort of
 
01:03:15.530 --> 01:03:15.540 align:start position:0%
this accredited over and above basic
 
01:03:17.750 --> 01:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
licensing I mean I think there's sort of
 
01:03:19.789 --> 01:03:19.799 align:start position:0%
this and I think it's safety I
 
01:03:21.650 --> 01:03:21.660 align:start position:0%
understand that it was really designed
 
01:03:24.650 --> 01:03:24.660 align:start position:0%
for safety basic licensing is there to
 
01:03:26.930 --> 01:03:26.940 align:start position:0%
make sure that everyone's safe and well
 
01:03:30.289 --> 01:03:30.299 align:start position:0%
cared for as opposed to you know
 
01:03:32.990 --> 01:03:33.000 align:start position:0%
the best optimum care to promote their
 
01:03:34.549 --> 01:03:34.559 align:start position:0%
Optimum development that's where you
 
01:03:36.589 --> 01:03:36.599 align:start position:0%
start getting into the license plus and
 
01:03:38.809 --> 01:03:38.819 align:start position:0%
credit and all that that are doing more
 
01:03:41.450 --> 01:03:41.460 align:start position:0%
than that so again I believe accredited
 
01:03:44.210 --> 01:03:44.220 align:start position:0%
programs have a one to three Melissa you
 
01:03:45.530 --> 01:03:45.540 align:start position:0%
might know
 
01:03:49.490 --> 01:03:49.500 align:start position:0%
um infant Etc so our licensing is not
 
01:03:52.010 --> 01:03:52.020 align:start position:0%
the optimum but it's safe
 
01:03:53.710 --> 01:03:53.720 align:start position:0%
it's safe
 
01:03:56.589 --> 01:03:56.599 align:start position:0%
safety once again opening
 
01:03:59.030 --> 01:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
an analogy someone did once before
 
01:04:00.950 --> 01:04:00.960 align:start position:0%
licensing's purpose really again is
 
01:04:02.390 --> 01:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
safety if you think of a restaurant you
 
01:04:03.950 --> 01:04:03.960 align:start position:0%
know they have this sticker in the
 
01:04:06.710 --> 01:04:06.720 align:start position:0%
kitchen about basic safety but there's a
 
01:04:07.970 --> 01:04:07.980 align:start position:0%
different system to tell you whether or
 
01:04:10.789 --> 01:04:10.799 align:start position:0%
not the food tastes good right you know
 
01:04:13.549 --> 01:04:13.559 align:start position:0%
that's yeah right
 
01:04:15.589 --> 01:04:15.599 align:start position:0%
other questions for some Philips you
 
01:04:17.809 --> 01:04:17.819 align:start position:0%
have your hand up or just busy being a
 
01:04:19.370 --> 01:04:19.380 align:start position:0%
mom it's all right it makes you
 
01:04:20.329 --> 01:04:20.339 align:start position:0%
something about like working at Child
 
01:04:22.130 --> 01:04:22.140 align:start position:0%
Care Center I don't even hear like it's
 
01:04:23.510 --> 01:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
it's like it's just like white noise
 
01:04:25.549 --> 01:04:25.559 align:start position:0%
just sit there I'm on a conference call
 
01:04:26.870 --> 01:04:26.880 align:start position:0%
or gin she just hears the back she's
 
01:04:28.370 --> 01:04:28.380 align:start position:0%
like how do you do that doesn't even
 
01:04:29.990 --> 01:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
phase me
 
01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:30.650 align:start position:0%
phase me
um

01:04:30.650 --> 01:04:30.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:32.450 --> 01:04:32.460 align:start position:0%
all right I think that's all we have for
 
01:04:34.549 --> 01:04:34.559 align:start position:0%
you um I know this that was my that was
 
01:04:36.289 --> 01:04:36.299 align:start position:0%
my own bombshell
 
01:04:38.270 --> 01:04:38.280 align:start position:0%
um was not wholesale change but
 
01:04:39.470 --> 01:04:39.480 align:start position:0%
something similar to a Massachusetts
 
01:04:42.170 --> 01:04:42.180 align:start position:0%
great system with new hampshire-based
 
01:04:42.180 --> 01:04:43.490 align:start position:0%
great system with new hampshire-based
ratios

01:04:43.490 --> 01:04:43.500 align:start position:0%
ratios
 
01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:44.390 align:start position:0%
ratios
um

01:04:44.390 --> 01:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:47.030 --> 01:04:47.040 align:start position:0%
anybody else have any um so I'll get you
 
01:04:48.650 --> 01:04:48.660 align:start position:0%
something in writing you can ship it
 
01:04:50.089 --> 01:04:50.099 align:start position:0%
over there and we can see if that 27
 
01:04:51.950 --> 01:04:51.960 align:start position:0%
increases a little bit
 
01:04:54.470 --> 01:04:54.480 align:start position:0%
um yes we would like to
 
01:04:56.089 --> 01:04:56.099 align:start position:0%
of course no that's the whole point of
 
01:04:56.099 --> 01:04:57.349 align:start position:0%
of course no that's the whole point of
this

01:04:57.349 --> 01:04:57.359 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:05:00.170 --> 01:05:00.180 align:start position:0%
debate this out
 
01:05:03.789 --> 01:05:03.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:06.230 --> 01:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
well I'm not here to tell you no my name
 
01:05:07.609 --> 01:05:07.619 align:start position:0%
is Melissa Clement I'm the chief of the
 
01:05:09.770 --> 01:05:09.780 align:start position:0%
child care licensing unit so
 
01:05:12.349 --> 01:05:12.359 align:start position:0%
um I wanted to explain what I did with
 
01:05:14.030 --> 01:05:14.040 align:start position:0%
this chart and what I why I wanted to
 
01:05:16.010 --> 01:05:16.020 align:start position:0%
present it to the committee
 
01:05:18.230 --> 01:05:18.240 align:start position:0%
um so essentially
 
01:05:20.210 --> 01:05:20.220 align:start position:0%
um every time we do a revision we always
 
01:05:21.650 --> 01:05:21.660 align:start position:0%
look to see what other states are doing
 
01:05:23.450 --> 01:05:23.460 align:start position:0%
and we particularly focus on the ones
 
01:05:24.589 --> 01:05:24.599 align:start position:0%
that are around New Hampshire because
 
01:05:26.690 --> 01:05:26.700 align:start position:0%
those are the ones that our New
 
01:05:28.370 --> 01:05:28.380 align:start position:0%
Hampshire programs are technically
 
01:05:29.930 --> 01:05:29.940 align:start position:0%
competing against especially when you're
 
01:05:32.150 --> 01:05:32.160 align:start position:0%
on the border so we we often look at
 
01:05:34.370 --> 01:05:34.380 align:start position:0%
Vermont Maine and Massachusetts to see
 
01:05:37.010 --> 01:05:37.020 align:start position:0%
what they're doing and we evaluate our
 
01:05:39.890 --> 01:05:39.900 align:start position:0%
regulations based on that as well so the
 
01:05:41.870 --> 01:05:41.880 align:start position:0%
chart is presented here with all the
 
01:05:43.670 --> 01:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
different age groups that we have in New
 
01:05:46.250 --> 01:05:46.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and then I listed Vermont
 
01:05:47.750 --> 01:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
Maine Massachusetts these are all
 
01:05:49.309 --> 01:05:49.319 align:start position:0%
updated these are all the current ones
 
01:05:50.870 --> 01:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
that they have the years that are there
 
01:05:52.670 --> 01:05:52.680 align:start position:0%
the years that they adopted those ratios
 
01:05:55.190 --> 01:05:55.200 align:start position:0%
Connecticut currently is proposing
 
01:05:56.990 --> 01:05:57.000 align:start position:0%
something different for one age group
 
01:05:59.569 --> 01:05:59.579 align:start position:0%
and that's the asterisk there at the end
 
01:06:01.670 --> 01:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
is the national standards and those I
 
01:06:03.650 --> 01:06:03.660 align:start position:0%
would I'm assuming they're naus C
 
01:06:05.270 --> 01:06:05.280 align:start position:0%
standards as well but these are the ones
 
01:06:07.069 --> 01:06:07.079 align:start position:0%
from caring for our children which is
 
01:06:09.410 --> 01:06:09.420 align:start position:0%
the comes from the American Academy of
 
01:06:10.789 --> 01:06:10.799 align:start position:0%
Pediatrics they're kind of the gold
 
01:06:13.549 --> 01:06:13.559 align:start position:0%
standard of what they believe provides
 
01:06:15.650 --> 01:06:15.660 align:start position:0%
the optimal learning for children and
 
01:06:17.270 --> 01:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
when they're being cared for in groups
 
01:06:20.510 --> 01:06:20.520 align:start position:0%
and then the final column is the most
 
01:06:22.910 --> 01:06:22.920 align:start position:0%
common in 2020 and this is the most
 
01:06:26.510 --> 01:06:26.520 align:start position:0%
common by state so what you have here is
 
01:06:29.029 --> 01:06:29.039 align:start position:0%
if you look at the First Column for the
 
01:06:30.650 --> 01:06:30.660 align:start position:0%
infants it's a one to four it's the most
 
01:06:32.990 --> 01:06:33.000 align:start position:0%
common ratio and that's with 33 States
 
01:06:36.650 --> 01:06:36.660 align:start position:0%
and then their most common group size is
 
01:06:38.690 --> 01:06:38.700 align:start position:0%
eight and that's in 20 States so that
 
01:06:40.789 --> 01:06:40.799 align:start position:0%
kind of gives you an overview of the
 
01:06:42.589 --> 01:06:42.599 align:start position:0%
country along with more detailed about
 
01:06:45.289 --> 01:06:45.299 align:start position:0%
what's in New England
 
01:06:47.210 --> 01:06:47.220 align:start position:0%
um I really appreciate that you're
 
01:06:48.829 --> 01:06:48.839 align:start position:0%
taking a real measured look at this
 
01:06:50.809 --> 01:06:50.819 align:start position:0%
because as you can imagine every time
 
01:06:53.750 --> 01:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
ratios come up our hearts kind of go oh
 
01:06:55.390 --> 01:06:55.400 align:start position:0%
boy what's next
 
01:07:00.170 --> 01:07:00.180 align:start position:0%
and I can also speak to I was before I
 
01:07:00.180 --> 01:07:01.130 align:start position:0%
and I can also speak to I was before I
became

01:07:01.130 --> 01:07:01.140 align:start position:0%
became
 
01:07:01.140 --> 01:07:01.789 align:start position:0%
became
um

01:07:01.789 --> 01:07:01.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:04.490 --> 01:07:04.500 align:start position:0%
license working in licensed choke as a
 
01:07:06.349 --> 01:07:06.359 align:start position:0%
licensing coordinator and working for
 
01:07:08.870 --> 01:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
DHHS I worked in programs mainly with
 
01:07:11.150 --> 01:07:11.160 align:start position:0%
infants and toddlers that was my passion
 
01:07:13.130 --> 01:07:13.140 align:start position:0%
and I did it in Massachusetts and in New
 
01:07:15.049 --> 01:07:15.059 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so I have a really good
 
01:07:17.450 --> 01:07:17.460 align:start position:0%
understanding of what the ratios mean in
 
01:07:19.789 --> 01:07:19.799 align:start position:0%
practice because that these ratios have
 
01:07:22.490 --> 01:07:22.500 align:start position:0%
been the same this whole time
 
01:07:24.950 --> 01:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
um working in Massachusetts I can tell
 
01:07:27.470 --> 01:07:27.480 align:start position:0%
you that it didn't have to do with the
 
01:07:28.849 --> 01:07:28.859 align:start position:0%
quality of the program I would say the
 
01:07:30.289 --> 01:07:30.299 align:start position:0%
quality of the programs I worked in a
 
01:07:31.490 --> 01:07:31.500 align:start position:0%
mass and the ones I worked in New
 
01:07:33.109 --> 01:07:33.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire were similar
 
01:07:34.910 --> 01:07:34.920 align:start position:0%
um as far as how they were operating how
 
01:07:37.450 --> 01:07:37.460 align:start position:0%
they were run it was so much more
 
01:07:40.490 --> 01:07:40.500 align:start position:0%
relaxed and better in Massachusetts
 
01:07:43.970 --> 01:07:43.980 align:start position:0%
because of the one to three or the two
 
01:07:46.609 --> 01:07:46.619 align:start position:0%
two to seven I can just tell you that's
 
01:07:49.069 --> 01:07:49.079 align:start position:0%
a completely different atmosphere and
 
01:07:51.410 --> 01:07:51.420 align:start position:0%
also their group sizes are smaller it's
 
01:07:53.329 --> 01:07:53.339 align:start position:0%
not just the ratio
 
01:07:56.450 --> 01:07:56.460 align:start position:0%
it's the number of bodies that you have
 
01:07:59.270 --> 01:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
in a room that really speaks to what the
 
01:08:01.549 --> 01:08:01.559 align:start position:0%
children experience I mean I can speak
 
01:08:04.250 --> 01:08:04.260 align:start position:0%
to staff but I for children if you're
 
01:08:07.130 --> 01:08:07.140 align:start position:0%
ever worked in an infant classroom you
 
01:08:09.230 --> 01:08:09.240 align:start position:0%
know that when children one starts
 
01:08:11.870 --> 01:08:11.880 align:start position:0%
crying there's an automated response and
 
01:08:13.490 --> 01:08:13.500 align:start position:0%
it goes down the line so now you're
 
01:08:15.349 --> 01:08:15.359 align:start position:0%
dealing with multiple children who need
 
01:08:17.630 --> 01:08:17.640 align:start position:0%
things at the same time with potentially
 
01:08:20.570 --> 01:08:20.580 align:start position:0%
fewer staff to respond and one of the
 
01:08:20.580 --> 01:08:22.309 align:start position:0%
fewer staff to respond and one of the
most

01:08:22.309 --> 01:08:22.319 align:start position:0%
most
 
01:08:24.229 --> 01:08:24.239 align:start position:0%
um critical ways that you can have
 
01:08:26.329 --> 01:08:26.339 align:start position:0%
children especially infants learn is
 
01:08:28.729 --> 01:08:28.739 align:start position:0%
what they call serve and return where a
 
01:08:31.249 --> 01:08:31.259 align:start position:0%
child is doing and responding in whether
 
01:08:32.809 --> 01:08:32.819 align:start position:0%
they're crying making noises cooing
 
01:08:34.669 --> 01:08:34.679 align:start position:0%
whatever they're doing that they have a
 
01:08:37.910 --> 01:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
provider there to respond back and that
 
01:08:40.370 --> 01:08:40.380 align:start position:0%
changes obviously based on the number of
 
01:08:42.590 --> 01:08:42.600 align:start position:0%
adults that you have in the room
 
01:08:44.269 --> 01:08:44.279 align:start position:0%
um so those are the things I just wanted
 
01:08:47.090 --> 01:08:47.100 align:start position:0%
to bring up I've done both and I know
 
01:08:49.189 --> 01:08:49.199 align:start position:0%
the Massachusetts doing the one to three
 
01:08:51.829 --> 01:08:51.839 align:start position:0%
two to seven it was immensely better
 
01:08:53.570 --> 01:08:53.580 align:start position:0%
working in Massachusetts but I was
 
01:08:54.890 --> 01:08:54.900 align:start position:0%
originally from New Hampshire I came
 
01:08:56.870 --> 01:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
back because I like the state itself but
 
01:08:58.669 --> 01:08:58.679 align:start position:0%
the child care working in the child care
 
01:09:01.130 --> 01:09:01.140 align:start position:0%
was different and I experienced that
 
01:09:03.289 --> 01:09:03.299 align:start position:0%
firsthand so I just wanted to share that
 
01:09:05.329 --> 01:09:05.339 align:start position:0%
as well and toddlers you know they don't
 
01:09:09.890 --> 01:09:09.900 align:start position:0%
stop moving so if you anytime you juggle
 
01:09:12.169 --> 01:09:12.179 align:start position:0%
that and you have you know more kids
 
01:09:14.689 --> 01:09:14.699 align:start position:0%
with fewer staff it it just it's going
 
01:09:16.010 --> 01:09:16.020 align:start position:0%
to become that much more difficult than
 
01:09:18.530 --> 01:09:18.540 align:start position:0%
I am worried about our Workforce
 
01:09:21.769 --> 01:09:21.779 align:start position:0%
in again this is personal experience in
 
01:09:23.689 --> 01:09:23.699 align:start position:0%
my early 20s I worked with mainly
 
01:09:26.150 --> 01:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
one-year-olds and two-year-olds
 
01:09:27.590 --> 01:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
um that is the time of your life when
 
01:09:29.809 --> 01:09:29.819 align:start position:0%
you have the most energy I wasn't
 
01:09:32.689 --> 01:09:32.699 align:start position:0%
married I didn't have kids
 
01:09:34.370 --> 01:09:34.380 align:start position:0%
um I would have friends that would
 
01:09:36.289 --> 01:09:36.299 align:start position:0%
request that hey it's Friday night let's
 
01:09:37.789 --> 01:09:37.799 align:start position:0%
go out I was like I'm going to be asleep
 
01:09:40.249 --> 01:09:40.259 align:start position:0%
by 7 30. I have been working with these
 
01:09:42.349 --> 01:09:42.359 align:start position:0%
one and two-year-olds all week I don't
 
01:09:44.269 --> 01:09:44.279 align:start position:0%
have the energy for that so anytime
 
01:09:46.490 --> 01:09:46.500 align:start position:0%
you're trying to add more children with
 
01:09:49.189 --> 01:09:49.199 align:start position:0%
fewer staff I can imagine that there
 
01:09:50.990 --> 01:09:51.000 align:start position:0%
will be an impact it's harder to
 
01:09:53.390 --> 01:09:53.400 align:start position:0%
quantify it's more of a qualitative
 
01:09:55.070 --> 01:09:55.080 align:start position:0%
experience it's really harder to
 
01:09:56.870 --> 01:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
quantify but I wanted to express that as
 
01:09:58.370 --> 01:09:58.380 align:start position:0%
well of course and we have to balance
 
01:09:59.990 --> 01:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
that with the impact of people not being
 
01:10:02.150 --> 01:10:02.160 align:start position:0%
able to find Child Care nope right we
 
01:10:03.290 --> 01:10:03.300 align:start position:0%
really understand it we've heard about
 
01:10:05.030 --> 01:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
how teachers don't get paid enough this
 
01:10:06.530 --> 01:10:06.540 align:start position:0%
is an opportunity to increase cash flow
 
01:10:08.450 --> 01:10:08.460 align:start position:0%
through the center right so this is a
 
01:10:09.590 --> 01:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
balancing act
 
01:10:11.330 --> 01:10:11.340 align:start position:0%
um and that's you know that's that's one
 
01:10:12.410 --> 01:10:12.420 align:start position:0%
of the reasons I thought we had to have
 
01:10:14.510 --> 01:10:14.520 align:start position:0%
the conversation is we often when it
 
01:10:16.729 --> 01:10:16.739 align:start position:0%
comes to ratios we look at the overwhelm
 
01:10:18.470 --> 01:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
the negative of increasing it the
 
01:10:20.810 --> 01:10:20.820 align:start position:0%
negatives are obvious but we often
 
01:10:22.850 --> 01:10:22.860 align:start position:0%
Overlook the positives which is
 
01:10:25.070 --> 01:10:25.080 align:start position:0%
increased teacher pay increase access to
 
01:10:26.990 --> 01:10:27.000 align:start position:0%
child care supply you increase access to
 
01:10:28.490 --> 01:10:28.500 align:start position:0%
child care supply and providers also
 
01:10:31.610 --> 01:10:31.620 align:start position:0%
have to start competing for for parents
 
01:10:33.110 --> 01:10:33.120 align:start position:0%
again when they have to start paying
 
01:10:34.430 --> 01:10:34.440 align:start position:0%
appearance again they start enrolling in
 
01:10:35.870 --> 01:10:35.880 align:start position:0%
things like the grand steps for Quality
 
01:10:37.550 --> 01:10:37.560 align:start position:0%
right and then we start bringing some
 
01:10:39.290 --> 01:10:39.300 align:start position:0%
Market balance back
 
01:10:39.300 --> 01:10:39.890 align:start position:0%
Market balance back
um

01:10:39.890 --> 01:10:39.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:41.330 --> 01:10:41.340 align:start position:0%
but it's it's obvious it's a
 
01:10:42.770 --> 01:10:42.780 align:start position:0%
conversation that has to take place in
 
01:10:44.810 --> 01:10:44.820 align:start position:0%
good faith with open minds
 
01:10:44.820 --> 01:10:45.530 align:start position:0%
good faith with open minds
um

01:10:45.530 --> 01:10:45.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:51.470 --> 01:10:51.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:53.270 --> 01:10:53.280 align:start position:0%
I mean what this chart was and to give
 
01:10:54.770 --> 01:10:54.780 align:start position:0%
you some well you've saved me from
 
01:10:55.729 --> 01:10:55.739 align:start position:0%
having to do some work because you got
 
01:10:56.689 --> 01:10:56.699 align:start position:0%
the Massachusetts numbers that already
 
01:11:00.290 --> 01:11:00.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:02.390 --> 01:11:02.400 align:start position:0%
thank you very much anyone else wants to
 
01:11:05.090 --> 01:11:05.100 align:start position:0%
comment on the totally Kumbaya subject
 
01:11:08.270 --> 01:11:08.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:08.280 --> 01:11:16.189 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:11:16.189 --> 01:11:16.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:17.930 --> 01:11:17.940 align:start position:0%
part I will be speaking as the executive
 
01:11:19.189 --> 01:11:19.199 align:start position:0%
director at Merrimack Valley daycare
 
01:11:21.410 --> 01:11:21.420 align:start position:0%
service so my knee to reaction is
 
01:11:23.870 --> 01:11:23.880 align:start position:0%
definitely to not increase ratios but
 
01:11:26.330 --> 01:11:26.340 align:start position:0%
your argument is compelling and the way
 
01:11:28.370 --> 01:11:28.380 align:start position:0%
that I could actually see myself doing
 
01:11:30.830 --> 01:11:30.840 align:start position:0%
this is average daily attendance so
 
01:11:33.050 --> 01:11:33.060 align:start position:0%
anyone who works in child care knows the
 
01:11:34.610 --> 01:11:34.620 align:start position:0%
only way you can ever make any money is
 
01:11:36.169 --> 01:11:36.179 align:start position:0%
to keep your average daily attendance at
 
01:11:37.910 --> 01:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
a certain amount but no one attends
 
01:11:39.290 --> 01:11:39.300 align:start position:0%
every day I mean it's rare to have a
 
01:11:41.870 --> 01:11:41.880 align:start position:0%
person who comes every day and so the
 
01:11:43.970 --> 01:11:43.980 align:start position:0%
ability to over enroll slightly so your
 
01:11:46.910 --> 01:11:46.920 align:start position:0%
average daily attendance is correct is a
 
01:11:49.010 --> 01:11:49.020 align:start position:0%
great way to stay economically helpful
 
01:11:51.709 --> 01:11:51.719 align:start position:0%
uh healthy so I can see this as being a
 
01:11:52.910 --> 01:11:52.920 align:start position:0%
benefit for your average daily
 
01:11:55.370 --> 01:11:55.380 align:start position:0%
attendance and if you slightly over
 
01:11:56.930 --> 01:11:56.940 align:start position:0%
enroll for an infant room and you're
 
01:11:59.510 --> 01:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
over by one child one day a week or
 
01:12:01.550 --> 01:12:01.560 align:start position:0%
something it's okay you're still within
 
01:12:03.709 --> 01:12:03.719 align:start position:0%
your ratio to do so so I just want to
 
01:12:06.350 --> 01:12:06.360 align:start position:0%
say that it's possible that maybe this
 
01:12:07.550 --> 01:12:07.560 align:start position:0%
is something that can move forward with
 
01:12:09.950 --> 01:12:09.960 align:start position:0%
some caveats attached to it so you
 
01:12:11.030 --> 01:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
literally have to literally have I
 
01:12:13.669 --> 01:12:13.679 align:start position:0%
thought about it it was was I've never
 
01:12:15.229 --> 01:12:15.239 align:start position:0%
seen I never see eight kids in my infant
 
01:12:17.450 --> 01:12:17.460 align:start position:0%
room God I'd love to enroll nine but
 
01:12:18.590 --> 01:12:18.600 align:start position:0%
what happens if they're all here on the
 
01:12:25.070 --> 01:12:25.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:26.810 --> 01:12:26.820 align:start position:0%
any other questions comments concerns
 
01:12:28.550 --> 01:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
and wait by the way we will come back to
 
01:12:30.169 --> 01:12:30.179 align:start position:0%
this so don't I don't think this is the
 
01:12:31.610 --> 01:12:31.620 align:start position:0%
end I'll be all this just opening Salvo
 
01:12:39.470 --> 01:12:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:41.750 --> 01:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
thank you again my apologies I just
 
01:12:43.610 --> 01:12:43.620 align:start position:0%
remembered one other thing any change
 
01:12:45.530 --> 01:12:45.540 align:start position:0%
that we have to do will have to run by
 
01:12:47.450 --> 01:12:47.460 align:start position:0%
the State Fire Marshal's office as well
 
01:12:49.550 --> 01:12:49.560 align:start position:0%
they have State Fire codes that are
 
01:12:51.290 --> 01:12:51.300 align:start position:0%
actually more strict than our child care
 
01:12:53.510 --> 01:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
licensing rules but we are able to
 
01:12:55.250 --> 01:12:55.260 align:start position:0%
operate under our rules with the
 
01:12:57.050 --> 01:12:57.060 align:start position:0%
variance from them so if we change
 
01:12:58.970 --> 01:12:58.980 align:start position:0%
anything we have to run it by them as
 
01:13:01.250 --> 01:13:01.260 align:start position:0%
well to get there we've never talked
 
01:13:02.830 --> 01:13:02.840 align:start position:0%
about fire codes
 
01:13:05.209 --> 01:13:05.219 align:start position:0%
I just want to say that that's part of
 
01:13:06.169 --> 01:13:06.179 align:start position:0%
that would have to be part of the
 
01:13:07.669 --> 01:13:07.679 align:start position:0%
conversation I think I wrote I think I
 
01:13:08.870 --> 01:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
wrote an amendment specifically about
 
01:13:11.689 --> 01:13:11.699 align:start position:0%
that and then the other
 
01:13:13.250 --> 01:13:13.260 align:start position:0%
um it was something that came up when
 
01:13:15.530 --> 01:13:15.540 align:start position:0%
you were discussing the gsq
 
01:13:17.689 --> 01:13:17.699 align:start position:0%
um representative Barry I heard you say
 
01:13:20.090 --> 01:13:20.100 align:start position:0%
during testimony that A Lead Teacher is
 
01:13:21.590 --> 01:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
required in every classroom and that's
 
01:13:23.209 --> 01:13:23.219 align:start position:0%
actually not accurate so I wanted to
 
01:13:24.950 --> 01:13:24.960 align:start position:0%
make sure that that was clear as well
 
01:13:27.169 --> 01:13:27.179 align:start position:0%
it's required when there's three or more
 
01:13:29.270 --> 01:13:29.280 align:start position:0%
teachers based on the group size but
 
01:13:30.530 --> 01:13:30.540 align:start position:0%
it's not required in every classroom
 
01:13:33.470 --> 01:13:33.480 align:start position:0%
that's true that's true I I do think I'm
 
01:13:35.030 --> 01:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
from the perspective of my own Center so
 
01:13:38.330 --> 01:13:38.340 align:start position:0%
yes that's it admittedly a bias
 
01:13:41.390 --> 01:13:41.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:43.550 --> 01:13:43.560 align:start position:0%
um anything else
 
01:13:45.229 --> 01:13:45.239 align:start position:0%
all right well with that
 
01:13:46.550 --> 01:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
um not probably not going to meet next
 
01:13:47.689 --> 01:13:47.699 align:start position:0%
week just kind of bring it from a fire
 
01:13:49.189 --> 01:13:49.199 align:start position:0%
hose right now
 
01:13:50.750 --> 01:13:50.760 align:start position:0%
um with other things
 
01:13:52.130 --> 01:13:52.140 align:start position:0%
um I I kind of outlined the beginning
 
01:13:54.229 --> 01:13:54.239 align:start position:0%
what our next two meetings will be about
 
01:13:55.550 --> 01:13:55.560 align:start position:0%
um the be our final two work session
 
01:13:56.870 --> 01:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
meetings here in Concord one more
 
01:13:58.550 --> 01:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
meeting um in the field possibly one
 
01:14:01.850 --> 01:14:01.860 align:start position:0%
more after that uh and then uh uh MJ I'm
 
01:14:04.610 --> 01:14:04.620 align:start position:0%
sorry representative Waller I apologize
 
01:14:06.709 --> 01:14:06.719 align:start position:0%
um the informality
 
01:14:09.530 --> 01:14:09.540 align:start position:0%
um my goal is to meet again after those
 
01:14:11.630 --> 01:14:11.640 align:start position:0%
let's say the next three meetings
 
01:14:13.430 --> 01:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
um would be to meet once or twice before
 
01:14:15.590 --> 01:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
Bill filing so we could let's say uh
 
01:14:17.330 --> 01:14:17.340 align:start position:0%
finish our work
 
01:14:19.250 --> 01:14:19.260 align:start position:0%
um and come to consensus just so you
 
01:14:21.709 --> 01:14:21.719 align:start position:0%
know as the ranking member how dare you
 
01:14:23.810 --> 01:14:23.820 align:start position:0%
how dare you I will hold it against you
 
01:14:26.209 --> 01:14:26.219 align:start position:0%
forever yes representative page
 
01:14:28.550 --> 01:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
something else I'm curious about and I'd
 
01:14:30.830 --> 01:14:30.840 align:start position:0%
love to have someone speak to at a
 
01:14:33.410 --> 01:14:33.420 align:start position:0%
future meeting is on the use of the uh
 
01:14:35.510 --> 01:14:35.520 align:start position:0%
remaining arpa dollars
 
01:14:35.520 --> 01:14:36.350 align:start position:0%
remaining arpa dollars
um

01:14:36.350 --> 01:14:36.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:38.810 --> 01:14:38.820 align:start position:0%
because just seeing how
 
01:14:41.510 --> 01:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
how the the plan for expending those
 
01:14:42.770 --> 01:14:42.780 align:start position:0%
remaining dollars there's a lot of
 
01:14:45.050 --> 01:14:45.060 align:start position:0%
interesting things there
 
01:14:47.570 --> 01:14:47.580 align:start position:0%
um and I'd like to think I'd like to
 
01:14:49.490 --> 01:14:49.500 align:start position:0%
think about how we as a committee might
 
01:14:51.709 --> 01:14:51.719 align:start position:0%
piggyback and on that work and sustain
 
01:14:53.450 --> 01:14:53.460 align:start position:0%
it you know My worry is there's this one
 
01:14:55.610 --> 01:14:55.620 align:start position:0%
shot of this Russia Federal funding
 
01:14:57.370 --> 01:14:57.380 align:start position:0%
we're suddenly going to spend it before
 
01:15:00.050 --> 01:15:00.060 align:start position:0%
the deadline hits
 
01:15:02.870 --> 01:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
um you know and I want to make sure that
 
01:15:06.590 --> 01:15:06.600 align:start position:0%
that that that that work doesn't just
 
01:15:09.169 --> 01:15:09.179 align:start position:0%
you know wither because there's no plan
 
01:15:11.090 --> 01:15:11.100 align:start position:0%
for sustaining it beyond the beyond the
 
01:15:12.950 --> 01:15:12.960 align:start position:0%
year so I'd love to hear more about the
 
01:15:14.630 --> 01:15:14.640 align:start position:0%
plan for expanding those funds see what
 
01:15:15.530 --> 01:15:15.540 align:start position:0%
we can do
 
01:15:17.510 --> 01:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
um our money always gives me a heartburn
 
01:15:18.830 --> 01:15:18.840 align:start position:0%
so it's okay
 
01:15:20.990 --> 01:15:21.000 align:start position:0%
all right uh with that we will close
 
01:15:22.370 --> 01:15:22.380 align:start position:0%

01:15:23.270 --> 01:15:23.280 align:start position:0%
