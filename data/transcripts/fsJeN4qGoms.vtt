00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:30.479 align:start position:0%

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:35.280 align:start position:0%
romney
 
00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:37.360 align:start position:0%
uh just so there's some discussion on
 
00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:38.720 align:start position:0%
this um
 
00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:40.880 align:start position:0%
so my reading of this there's really
 
00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
only two spots
 
00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:44.720 align:start position:0%
that work we need to be concerned with
 
00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:46.720 align:start position:0%
page four
 
00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:49.919 align:start position:0%
uh section 4 on line 16
 
00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:53.680 align:start position:0%
and to line 25 and then
 
00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
section 5 line 26 to 34
 
00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:02.160 align:start position:0%
which basically allows
 
00:07:04.629 --> 00:07:04.639 align:start position:0%
a transfer of money out of the two
 
00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:06.400 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds
 
00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
to to help fund this
 
00:07:12.309 --> 00:07:12.319 align:start position:0%
setting up of this database i just want
 
00:07:13.749 --> 00:07:13.759 align:start position:0%
to make sure
 
00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:15.680 align:start position:0%
that is what those are the two things
 
00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:17.840 align:start position:0%
only that we're dealing with
 
00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:20.160 align:start position:0%
uh uh is i guess that's a question to
 
00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:26.560 align:start position:0%
in my reading i agree
 
00:07:30.309 --> 00:07:30.319 align:start position:0%
unless somebody found something else
 
00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
okay and then can i have a follow-up
 
00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
comment representative romney
 
00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:37.840 align:start position:0%
this bill is similar to the bill we had
 
00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:38.800 align:start position:0%
last year
 
00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:42.080 align:start position:0%
um that passed through ways and means
 
00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:44.000 align:start position:0%
it went on to the senate but again like
 
00:07:46.309 --> 00:07:46.319 align:start position:0%
many other bills uh it was tabled
 
00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:49.360 align:start position:0%
without a hearing uh and correct me if
 
00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
i'm wrong
 
00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:51.680 align:start position:0%
that i think that's what happened with
 
00:07:53.029 --> 00:07:53.039 align:start position:0%
this one
 
00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:56.000 align:start position:0%
so we're familiar with it um it's
 
00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.110 align:start position:0%
so we're familiar with it um it's
changed

00:07:59.110 --> 00:07:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:00.560 align:start position:0%
last year there were i think there was a
 
00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:02.469 align:start position:0%
last year there were i think there was a
fee

00:08:02.469 --> 00:08:02.479 align:start position:0%
fee
 
00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
to help fund the ongoing
 
00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:08.720 align:start position:0%
the ongoing maintenance of this database
 
00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:10.080 align:start position:0%
but i guess they're going to the general
 
00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:11.110 align:start position:0%
but i guess they're going to the general
fund

00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:11.120 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:08:14.469 --> 00:08:14.479 align:start position:0%
again this year so but that that's
 
00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
uh so i with all of that
 
00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:19.840 align:start position:0%
uh i'm okay with the transferring of the
 
00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:20.550 align:start position:0%
uh i'm okay with the transferring of the
funds

00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:20.560 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
representative thank you mr chairman
 
00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:31.520 align:start position:0%
um i checked over in division one
 
00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:34.880 align:start position:0%
and they have have got
 
00:08:38.149 --> 00:08:38.159 align:start position:0%
the uh an extra i.t person
 
00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:41.919 align:start position:0%
and the 250 000 per year
 
00:08:45.269 --> 00:08:45.279 align:start position:0%
in the agriculture budget and they've
 
00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:46.800 align:start position:0%
approved it
 
00:08:50.310 --> 00:08:50.320 align:start position:0%
and uh the two
 
00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:52.320 align:start position:0%
we were worried about the rating of the
 
00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds being paid
 
00:08:57.829 --> 00:08:57.839 align:start position:0%
back that's what the fees were for on
 
00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:05.200 align:start position:0%
there is enough money in there so that
 
00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:06.800 align:start position:0%
those funds can survive
 
00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
because for several years they were not
 
00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
on doing the work they were supposed to
 
00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:13.600 align:start position:0%
be doing so they
 
00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:17.600 align:start position:0%
had money saved up and
 
00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
they can survive without this on
 
00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:23.680 align:start position:0%
i think there is a serious question of
 
00:09:24.389 --> 00:09:24.399 align:start position:0%
what they're
 
00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:26.480 align:start position:0%
how they're using the animal products
 
00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:28.240 align:start position:0%
fund but that's something that
 
00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
would have to be dealt with in a
 
00:09:31.269 --> 00:09:31.279 align:start position:0%
different bill or
 
00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:35.600 align:start position:0%
over in the the dedicated fund committee
 
00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:37.600 align:start position:0%
we're starting in the dedicated fund
 
00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:38.710 align:start position:0%
we're starting in the dedicated fund
committee

00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:38.720 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:42.160 align:start position:0%
so on i don't see anything else that we
 
00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:44.480 align:start position:0%
need to do this
 
00:09:48.829 --> 00:09:48.839 align:start position:0%
this year thanks okay representative
 
00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
amanda gordon thank you um
 
00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:54.640 align:start position:0%
just to correct one thing that
 
00:09:58.070 --> 00:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
uh representative um
 
00:10:01.509 --> 00:10:01.519 align:start position:0%
abrami said as the chair of ena
 
00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
the last term it actually did pass both
 
00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:06.240 align:start position:0%
the house and the senate
 
00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:08.640 align:start position:0%
it was put in one of the omnibus bills
 
00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:10.720 align:start position:0%
and then it was vetoed
 
00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
so it actually did pass both bodies just
 
00:10:15.269 --> 00:10:15.279 align:start position:0%
to let everybody know
 
00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:18.640 align:start position:0%
thank you amanda i know i know it passed
 
00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:19.350 align:start position:0%
thank you amanda i know i know it passed
it

00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:10:21.269 --> 00:10:21.279 align:start position:0%
made it a certain distance i wasn't sure
 
00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:23.360 align:start position:0%
if it made it through the senate or not
 
00:10:25.509 --> 00:10:25.519 align:start position:0%
but no worries yeah very confusing a lot
 
00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
of the ena bills
 
00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:29.600 align:start position:0%
um actually got trapped in the omnibus
 
00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:30.160 align:start position:0%
bills and
 
00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:32.320 align:start position:0%
last term we actually only passed one
 
00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:34.160 align:start position:0%
bill out of my committee
 
00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:36.880 align:start position:0%
so it's all good well thank you for that
 
00:10:37.829 --> 00:10:37.839 align:start position:0%
for that correction
 
00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:41.200 align:start position:0%
appreciate it i don't see any
 
00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
other hands raised so it looks like
 
00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:44.560 align:start position:0%
we're all set
 
00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:46.720 align:start position:0%
as an ought to pass tomorrow on this
 
00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:49.430 align:start position:0%
as an ought to pass tomorrow on this
bill

00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
i don't see anybody in opposition so
 
00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:52.480 align:start position:0%
we'll go
 
00:10:58.829 --> 00:10:58.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:58.839 --> 00:11:00.550 align:start position:0%
 
610.

00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:00.560 align:start position:0%
610.
 
00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
x10 is requiring certain licenses and
 
00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
reporting functions
 
00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
be conducted through the nationwide
 
00:11:09.829 --> 00:11:09.839 align:start position:0%
multi-state licensing system and
 
00:11:09.839 --> 00:11:11.030 align:start position:0%
multi-state licensing system and
registry

00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
registry
 
00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
and relative to the background and
 
00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:14.710 align:start position:0%
and relative to the background and
investigation

00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:14.720 align:start position:0%
investigation
 
00:11:18.389 --> 00:11:18.399 align:start position:0%
of trust officers to certain filing fees
 
00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:20.720 align:start position:0%
assessments and interest rates into the
 
00:11:22.949 --> 00:11:22.959 align:start position:0%
transmission of consumer complaints by
 
00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:28.949 --> 00:11:28.959 align:start position:0%
that was sponsored by representative
 
00:11:28.959 --> 00:11:32.870 align:start position:0%
that was sponsored by representative
hunt

00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
representative romney again i'll do the
 
00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
same just to get the conversation going
 
00:11:39.829 --> 00:11:39.839 align:start position:0%
uh we're on i think we're talking about
 
00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:41.440 align:start position:0%
page six
 
00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:44.640 align:start position:0%
way down the bottom line 36
 
00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:47.680 align:start position:0%
we're only talking about moving a fee
 
00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:48.720 align:start position:0%
from 10 000
 
00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:52.880 align:start position:0%
to 15 000 is that correct mr chair
 
00:11:56.629 --> 00:11:56.639 align:start position:0%
uh yes okay and we we also had this bill
 
00:11:58.230 --> 00:11:58.240 align:start position:0%
last year
 
00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:00.720 align:start position:0%
and i will not attempt to take a stab at
 
00:12:02.389 --> 00:12:02.399 align:start position:0%
what happened but it obviously
 
00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:05.440 align:start position:0%
didn't make it through to the uh
 
00:12:08.069 --> 00:12:08.079 align:start position:0%
it passed the house i'm not sure what
 
00:12:08.079 --> 00:12:08.629 align:start position:0%
it passed the house i'm not sure what
happened

00:12:08.629 --> 00:12:08.639 align:start position:0%
happened
 
00:12:10.629 --> 00:12:10.639 align:start position:0%
after that in the senate but it's back
 
00:12:12.389 --> 00:12:12.399 align:start position:0%
to us to this
 
00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:16.480 align:start position:0%
this week so uh this uh this year so
 
00:12:20.069 --> 00:12:20.079 align:start position:0%
uh my understanding was that that 10
 
00:12:22.629 --> 00:12:22.639 align:start position:0%
000 was too low and that they could
 
00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:24.800 align:start position:0%
capture a lot more
 
00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:28.480 align:start position:0%
uh by raising it to the 15 000
 
00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:30.720 align:start position:0%
which was close to what the average was
 
00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:32.320 align:start position:0%
of cost
 
00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:36.720 align:start position:0%
to uh to do the work for uh
 
00:12:39.829 --> 00:12:39.839 align:start position:0%
chartering new banks and credit unions
 
00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
it made sense to me last year if it
 
00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:47.920 align:start position:0%
makes sense to me this year
 
00:12:52.949 --> 00:12:52.959 align:start position:0%
thank you okay representative
 
00:12:56.870 --> 00:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
thank you just to add on they also
 
00:12:59.430 --> 00:12:59.440 align:start position:0%
are adding the ability for them to
 
00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:00.069 align:start position:0%
are adding the ability for them to
assess

00:13:00.069 --> 00:13:00.079 align:start position:0%
assess
 
00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
more money if the project extends past
 
00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:08.000 align:start position:0%
that 15 000 on because some
 
00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:10.160 align:start position:0%
some of the banking requests they get
 
00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:11.440 align:start position:0%
are huge
 
00:13:14.069 --> 00:13:14.079 align:start position:0%
but on if they pay for them out of their
 
00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:15.440 align:start position:0%
general fund
 
00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
which is covered by bank assessments all
 
00:13:20.069 --> 00:13:20.079 align:start position:0%
the other banks would have to pay for
 
00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:20.720 align:start position:0%
this one
 
00:13:23.829 --> 00:13:23.839 align:start position:0%
project and they feel that that's unfair
 
00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
it's a bank asking to become
 
00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:31.600 align:start position:0%
on on registered
 
00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:42.069 --> 00:13:42.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
anybody in to
 
00:13:50.629 --> 00:13:50.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:54.160 align:start position:0%
since now we go to
 
00:14:01.509 --> 00:14:01.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:13.269 --> 00:14:13.279 align:start position:0%
and house bill 614 is exempting the
 
00:14:13.279 --> 00:14:13.829 align:start position:0%
and house bill 614 is exempting the
state

00:14:13.829 --> 00:14:13.839 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:14:15.829 --> 00:14:15.839 align:start position:0%
and political subdivision from payments
 
00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:17.120 align:start position:0%
of the cost of
 
00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:19.680 align:start position:0%
compliance the renewable portfolio
 
00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:20.870 align:start position:0%
compliance the renewable portfolio
standards

00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
standards
 
00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:24.560 align:start position:0%
this came to us as amended by the house
 
00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
we'll come to find out mike floss this
 
00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
is chairman of the
 
00:14:33.509 --> 00:14:33.519 align:start position:0%
science and technology is that
 
00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:37.120 align:start position:0%
the amendment that was passed
 
00:14:39.829 --> 00:14:39.839 align:start position:0%
that they thought that they passed is
 
00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:42.720 align:start position:0%
not the amendment that you see
 
00:14:48.629 --> 00:14:48.639 align:start position:0%
in this bill so what needs to be done
 
00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:50.720 align:start position:0%
and i would have to check with the
 
00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:53.440 align:start position:0%
speaker to see if we could do it
 
00:15:00.069 --> 00:15:00.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
and amend this bill to do that but we're
 
00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:04.480 align:start position:0%
not the committee
 
00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:07.040 align:start position:0%
to do this really because this needed a
 
00:15:09.189 --> 00:15:09.199 align:start position:0%
public hearing
 
00:15:12.069 --> 00:15:12.079 align:start position:0%
mike ross called me this morning he's
 
00:15:12.079 --> 00:15:12.949 align:start position:0%
mike ross called me this morning he's
prepared

00:15:12.949 --> 00:15:12.959 align:start position:0%
prepared
 
00:15:17.269 --> 00:15:17.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:20.800 align:start position:0%
but my recommendation on this is so
 
00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:22.069 align:start position:0%
but my recommendation on this is so
confusing

00:15:22.069 --> 00:15:22.079 align:start position:0%
confusing
 
00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:25.120 align:start position:0%
the bill as we received it
 
00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
is not what they thought that they had
 
00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:29.910 align:start position:0%
is not what they thought that they had
passed

00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
passed
 
00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
so and i talked to mike boss this
 
00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:33.990 align:start position:0%
so and i talked to mike boss this
morning

00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:34.000 align:start position:0%
morning
 
00:15:38.069 --> 00:15:38.079 align:start position:0%
my recommendation is that we retain this
 
00:15:41.189 --> 00:15:41.199 align:start position:0%
so that work with my boss
 
00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:44.560 align:start position:0%
and recommend that they provide a new
 
00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:45.269 align:start position:0%
and recommend that they provide a new
bill

00:15:45.269 --> 00:15:45.279 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:50.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:59.749 --> 00:15:59.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:03.829 --> 00:16:03.839 align:start position:0%
mr chairman representative
 
00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
if they're going to provide a new bill
 
00:16:09.269 --> 00:16:09.279 align:start position:0%
in january
 
00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:12.720 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be better to itl this one
 
00:16:15.749 --> 00:16:15.759 align:start position:0%
with the recommendat reference
 
00:16:19.189 --> 00:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
that the committee asked that it be
 
00:16:22.069 --> 00:16:22.079 align:start position:0%
be killed so that a new bill could come
 
00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
forward next year
 
00:16:26.389 --> 00:16:26.399 align:start position:0%
rather than add to our retained list
 
00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
what they really wanted to do
 
00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
to this bill so that we would amend it
 
00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:40.480 align:start position:0%
and carry it forth because i feel it's
 
00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:42.389 align:start position:0%
and carry it forth because i feel it's
necessary

00:16:42.389 --> 00:16:42.399 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:45.440 align:start position:0%
but i explained we
 
00:16:48.389 --> 00:16:48.399 align:start position:0%
never had a public hearing on that
 
00:16:48.399 --> 00:16:49.590 align:start position:0%
never had a public hearing on that
amendment

00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:16:51.829 --> 00:16:51.839 align:start position:0%
and we're not the committee to do that
 
00:16:54.069 --> 00:16:54.079 align:start position:0%
it's a policy committee
 
00:16:57.910 --> 00:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:01.360 align:start position:0%
to be nice we would retain it and we
 
00:17:05.029 --> 00:17:05.039 align:start position:0%
would end up doing that rather than army
 
00:17:05.039 --> 00:17:08.390 align:start position:0%
would end up doing that rather than army
um

00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:11.909 --> 00:17:11.919 align:start position:0%
yes we could itl it because of this
 
00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:33.360 align:start position:0%
thank you um yes i i support
 
00:17:36.789 --> 00:17:36.799 align:start position:0%
i think that's a an appropriate
 
00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:39.520 align:start position:0%
response to the situation to retain and
 
00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:40.390 align:start position:0%
response to the situation to retain and
uh

00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:40.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
and then um we'll see how it how it
 
00:17:44.549 --> 00:17:44.559 align:start position:0%
flows but uh
 
00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:48.400 align:start position:0%
probably a new bill corrected bill
 
00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:52.160 align:start position:0%
in january would be
 
00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:54.640 align:start position:0%
what we would see and we would deal with
 
00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:55.760 align:start position:0%
the retained bill
 
00:17:59.830 --> 00:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
appropriately and i think uh
 
00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:03.520 align:start position:0%
sort of in support of that is uh that
 
00:18:06.789 --> 00:18:06.799 align:start position:0%
um the
 
00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:09.280 align:start position:0%
impact of an exemption for the political
 
00:18:11.029 --> 00:18:11.039 align:start position:0%
subdivisions is
 
00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:13.280 align:start position:0%
turns out to be pretty complicated that
 
00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:15.200 align:start position:0%
i'm guilty of sending
 
00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
uh quite a lot of information to the
 
00:18:18.789 --> 00:18:18.799 align:start position:0%
rest of the committee
 
00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:21.360 align:start position:0%
and i've been pouring over it and trying
 
00:18:22.390 --> 00:18:22.400 align:start position:0%
to understand this
 
00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:25.280 align:start position:0%
it's uh it's complicated it's the kind
 
00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:26.960 align:start position:0%
of stuff that really should be addressed
 
00:18:28.789 --> 00:18:28.799 align:start position:0%
by the policy committee
 
00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:33.280 align:start position:0%
and so i think this uh way of proceeding
 
00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:35.200 align:start position:0%
allows for that allows for a public
 
00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:36.720 align:start position:0%
hearing where people can
 
00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
provide additional input on that issue
 
00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:40.310 align:start position:0%
provide additional input on that issue
and

00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:40.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:43.600 align:start position:0%
so i favor the approach thank you
 
00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:44.390 align:start position:0%
so i favor the approach thank you
representative

00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:44.400 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:51.190 align:start position:0%
representative
representative

00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:54.880 align:start position:0%
who representative oh
 
00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
representative ruler we had to stand up
 
00:18:58.150 --> 00:18:58.160 align:start position:0%
before mine oh
 
00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:06.880 align:start position:0%
well but that's that's fine but there's
 
00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
no urgency on this bill is that correct
 
00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:11.360 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:13.840 align:start position:0%
the bill is is doesn't do what they run
 
00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:14.640 align:start position:0%
if you can do
 
00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:17.120 align:start position:0%
so it needs to be corrected one way or
 
00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:18.240 align:start position:0%
the other
 
00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:21.280 align:start position:0%
and i think uh by retaining
 
00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
let them do it is the proper way of
 
00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:24.720 align:start position:0%
doing it
 
00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:27.830 align:start position:0%
doing it
absolutely

00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:30.160 align:start position:0%
representative romney yeah mine's a
 
00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:32.720 align:start position:0%
question of the chair um
 
00:19:34.549 --> 00:19:34.559 align:start position:0%
have we already gotten guidance from the
 
00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
house clerk
 
00:19:39.909 --> 00:19:39.919 align:start position:0%
on this no okay so there may be an
 
00:19:42.789 --> 00:19:42.799 align:start position:0%
option that if we retain it that somehow
 
00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
we can work on it in the fall but
 
00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
either way i'm fine whether we retain it
 
00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:48.390 align:start position:0%
either way i'm fine whether we retain it
and

00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:48.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:51.200 align:start position:0%
and kill it kill it or retain it and we
 
00:19:53.029 --> 00:19:53.039 align:start position:0%
have the ability to work on it
 
00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:56.640 align:start position:0%
with the final view of the clerk um
 
00:19:58.870 --> 00:19:58.880 align:start position:0%
as to giving us guidance as to how far
 
00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:00.720 align:start position:0%
we can take this
 
00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:02.960 align:start position:0%
but again the amendment has nothing to
 
00:20:05.029 --> 00:20:05.039 align:start position:0%
do with us i don't think
 
00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:06.400 align:start position:0%
and that would make it very difficult
 
00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:08.960 align:start position:0%
for us to um
 
00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:11.360 align:start position:0%
move that amendment forward as my guess
 
00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:13.270 align:start position:0%
move that amendment forward as my guess
but

00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:13.280 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
i support either way we were going to
 
00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
retain it i was going to
 
00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:20.960 align:start position:0%
talk to the speaker and the clerk okay
 
00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
um get some guidance interrupted
 
00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
mr chair i think it's important for me
 
00:20:31.909 --> 00:20:31.919 align:start position:0%
to just reflect my constituency by
 
00:20:31.919 --> 00:20:32.470 align:start position:0%
to just reflect my constituency by
saying

00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:32.480 align:start position:0%
saying
 
00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:36.080 align:start position:0%
we would prefer to itl this bill um
 
00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:38.720 align:start position:0%
given the fact that it's not the format
 
00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:39.190 align:start position:0%
given the fact that it's not the format
that

00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:39.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
is even the preferred format and that my
 
00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
community is strongly against it i
 
00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:46.240 align:start position:0%
would just move to kill it
 
00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:48.720 align:start position:0%
when we get to that point i guess thank
 
00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:51.440 align:start position:0%
you representative phillips
 
00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:52.160 align:start position:0%
you representative phillips
uh

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:52.170 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:20:52.170 --> 00:20:54.470 align:start position:0%
uh
[Music]

00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:54.480 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:20:57.029 --> 00:20:57.039 align:start position:0%
jordan you still have your hand up yes i
 
00:20:58.070 --> 00:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
do um
 
00:21:01.029 --> 00:21:01.039 align:start position:0%
regarding uh the working session on this
 
00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
or retaining the bill
 
00:21:07.029 --> 00:21:07.039 align:start position:0%
if for some reason the speaker says that
 
00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:09.280 align:start position:0%
a similar bill cannot be re
 
00:21:12.149 --> 00:21:12.159 align:start position:0%
reintroduced having it retained gives us
 
00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:13.840 align:start position:0%
the ability to have
 
00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:17.360 align:start position:0%
a joint committee over the summer
 
00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:20.480 align:start position:0%
uh where this could be vetted with
 
00:21:24.070 --> 00:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
both science and technology and ways and
 
00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:24.789 align:start position:0%
both science and technology and ways and
means

00:21:24.789 --> 00:21:24.799 align:start position:0%
means
 
00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
and get it done in one large committee
 
00:21:30.149 --> 00:21:30.159 align:start position:0%
format or large zoom format with it
 
00:21:32.549 --> 00:21:32.559 align:start position:0%
however you two guys you and ross want
 
00:21:33.909 --> 00:21:33.919 align:start position:0%
to work it out
 
00:21:37.669 --> 00:21:37.679 align:start position:0%
uh would that be correct sir right
 
00:21:39.669 --> 00:21:39.679 align:start position:0%
isn't it great when we can discuss
 
00:21:42.789 --> 00:21:42.799 align:start position:0%
things because we kind of forget things
 
00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
if we do itl it they cannot
 
00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
bring it a new bill in in january
 
00:21:53.029 --> 00:21:53.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
they can do that and we can and then if
 
00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
the speaker
 
00:22:00.789 --> 00:22:00.799 align:start position:0%
in the clerk says that in retain
 
00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
have a public hearing and do all those
 
00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
things necessary
 
00:22:13.029 --> 00:22:13.039 align:start position:0%
to change it fine so by eye telling it
 
00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:14.000 align:start position:0%
it's dead
 
00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:26.320 align:start position:0%
all right then tomorrow we're going to
 
00:22:27.669 --> 00:22:27.679 align:start position:0%
speak mr
 
00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:30.880 align:start position:0%
chairman yes
 
00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:34.960 align:start position:0%
term on representative obama
 
00:22:37.029 --> 00:22:37.039 align:start position:0%
was allowed to bring back the horse
 
00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
racing bill
 
00:22:41.669 --> 00:22:41.679 align:start position:0%
intact with the new amendment that had
 
00:22:44.549 --> 00:22:44.559 align:start position:0%
been put on it when it went to the floor
 
00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:48.480 align:start position:0%
on because the speaker said so
 
00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:52.400 align:start position:0%
on their the speaker has complete
 
00:22:54.149 --> 00:22:54.159 align:start position:0%
discretion over what is
 
00:22:58.390 --> 00:22:58.400 align:start position:0%
different from the bill that god i tell
 
00:23:02.549 --> 00:23:02.559 align:start position:0%
you and that's been true for quite a
 
00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:04.240 align:start position:0%
long time though i don't remember it
 
00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:06.840 align:start position:0%
ever happening the way that one did
 
00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
uh so on
 
00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:12.880 align:start position:0%
i and especially
 
00:23:15.909 --> 00:23:15.919 align:start position:0%
when the itl is we've done this before
 
00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
when the itl is accompanied
 
00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:21.440 align:start position:0%
by on the committee has asked that
 
00:23:24.470 --> 00:23:24.480 align:start position:0%
we did this actually last term with a
 
00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:26.960 align:start position:0%
transportation bill uh the committee has
 
00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
asked that we itl is bill so they can
 
00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:29.909 align:start position:0%
asked that we itl is bill so they can
bring

00:23:29.909 --> 00:23:29.919 align:start position:0%
bring
 
00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:32.720 align:start position:0%
forward the correction that they want to
 
00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:34.960 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:23:37.669 --> 00:23:37.679 align:start position:0%
well the committee and talking to the
 
00:23:37.679 --> 00:23:39.270 align:start position:0%
well the committee and talking to the
chairman

00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:39.280 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:23:48.789 --> 00:23:48.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
representative romney i just want to
 
00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
react to
 
00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
uh what the representative army said
 
00:23:55.750 --> 00:23:55.760 align:start position:0%
yeah the historic racing bill
 
00:23:57.830 --> 00:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
um when i went to the speaker he
 
00:23:59.750 --> 00:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
deferred to the head uh dave i always
 
00:24:00.950 --> 00:24:00.960 align:start position:0%
forget his last name but
 
00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
uh the the head of uh office of
 
00:24:04.789 --> 00:24:04.799 align:start position:0%
legislative service
 
00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:07.360 align:start position:0%
who made the decision and he said that
 
00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:08.240 align:start position:0%
the bill was
 
00:24:09.990 --> 00:24:10.000 align:start position:0%
different enough than the original bill
 
00:24:12.310 --> 00:24:12.320 align:start position:0%
that he was he allowed it
 
00:24:15.190 --> 00:24:15.200 align:start position:0%
that's that's what happened i i he
 
00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:18.240 align:start position:0%
basically the speaker deferred to
 
00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:21.760 align:start position:0%
ols speaker told me that he'd
 
00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
read the original bill and realize that
 
00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:24.870 align:start position:0%
read the original bill and realize that
the

00:24:24.870 --> 00:24:24.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:26.720 align:start position:0%
amended bill which is the one that went
 
00:24:29.590 --> 00:24:29.600 align:start position:0%
to the floor was different
 
00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
right but and and but uh but the speaker
 
00:24:36.310 --> 00:24:36.320 align:start position:0%
conferred with the head of alas you may
 
00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:38.720 align:start position:0%
not know that part of the story
 
00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
that's what happened i had to sit down
 
00:24:42.549 --> 00:24:42.559 align:start position:0%
with the ols to explain
 
00:24:46.390 --> 00:24:46.400 align:start position:0%
to him what what the differences were
 
00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:49.200 align:start position:0%
do we want to wait uh waste our
 
00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:50.070 align:start position:0%
do we want to wait uh waste our
ammunition

00:24:50.070 --> 00:24:50.080 align:start position:0%
ammunition
 
00:24:53.190 --> 00:24:53.200 align:start position:0%
for a battle on this thing
 
00:24:56.870 --> 00:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
we're we haven't kind of an agreement
 
00:24:58.830 --> 00:24:58.840 align:start position:0%
that it can be handled
 
00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:02.950 align:start position:0%
that it can be handled
peacefully

00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:06.390 --> 00:25:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:08.480 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman i i just wanted
 
00:25:10.390 --> 00:25:10.400 align:start position:0%
to say where it seems like there's
 
00:25:13.510 --> 00:25:13.520 align:start position:0%
there's some um concern as to whether we
 
00:25:14.950 --> 00:25:14.960 align:start position:0%
could bring the bill back or not
 
00:25:16.470 --> 00:25:16.480 align:start position:0%
and not knowing if it'll be different
 
00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
enough and how the speaker
 
00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:21.200 align:start position:0%
will react it does seem prudent to uh
 
00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:24.640 align:start position:0%
retain and then decide
 
00:25:27.669 --> 00:25:27.679 align:start position:0%
at a later date how to move forward
 
00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:30.400 align:start position:0%
thank you okay so that tomorrow the
 
00:25:32.549 --> 00:25:32.559 align:start position:0%
debate will be whether the retained or
 
00:25:32.559 --> 00:25:35.029 align:start position:0%
debate will be whether the retained or
ital

00:25:35.029 --> 00:25:35.039 align:start position:0%
ital
 
00:25:38.149 --> 00:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
i don't think uh walter represented
 
00:25:38.159 --> 00:25:39.909 align:start position:0%
i don't think uh walter represented
stillsbury

00:25:39.909 --> 00:25:39.919 align:start position:0%
stillsbury
 
00:25:43.029 --> 00:25:43.039 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i believe the only
 
00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:45.440 align:start position:0%
difference between the bill as we heard
 
00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:46.310 align:start position:0%
difference between the bill as we heard
it

00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:46.320 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:25:48.390 --> 00:25:48.400 align:start position:0%
and the amendment is the addition of the
 
00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
very brief
 
00:25:53.029 --> 00:25:53.039 align:start position:0%
subparagraph e at the end so
 
00:25:54.630 --> 00:25:54.640 align:start position:0%
they're identical except for that little
 
00:25:56.630 --> 00:25:56.640 align:start position:0%
edition and i certainly
 
00:26:02.789 --> 00:26:02.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:06.080 align:start position:0%
all right anybody else wants to
 
00:26:13.029 --> 00:26:13.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:31.029 --> 00:26:31.039 align:start position:0%
an act reducing the penalty for certain
 
00:26:32.549 --> 00:26:32.559 align:start position:0%
first offense
 
00:26:50.830 --> 00:26:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:50.840 --> 00:27:01.669 align:start position:0%
 
that

00:27:01.669 --> 00:27:01.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:07.440 align:start position:0%
okay um on house bill 615
 
00:27:09.430 --> 00:27:09.440 align:start position:0%
represent our branding followed by
 
00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:13.110 align:start position:0%
represent our branding followed by
representative

00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:13.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:15.029 --> 00:27:15.039 align:start position:0%
these are the kind of bills i hate well
 
00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:16.320 align:start position:0%
we have to
 
00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:19.120 align:start position:0%
weigh in on fines i'm assuming that's
 
00:27:21.669 --> 00:27:21.679 align:start position:0%
what we're supposed to weigh in on
 
00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:24.960 align:start position:0%
is the reduction of the fines
 
00:27:27.669 --> 00:27:27.679 align:start position:0%
first off is that is that your read uh
 
00:27:34.310 --> 00:27:34.320 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
00:27:36.549 --> 00:27:36.559 align:start position:0%
i wasn't paying attention to that all
 
00:27:37.510 --> 00:27:37.520 align:start position:0%
right yeah uh
 
00:27:39.590 --> 00:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
it appears that we're supposed to
 
00:27:41.029 --> 00:27:41.039 align:start position:0%
address the fines here
 
00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:42.480 align:start position:0%
and the reduction of the fines is that
 
00:27:45.190 --> 00:27:45.200 align:start position:0%
the essence of what what's the deals
 
00:27:47.909 --> 00:27:47.919 align:start position:0%
okay none of the policies just the plan
 
00:27:47.919 --> 00:27:48.230 align:start position:0%
okay none of the policies just the plan
right

00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:48.240 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:27:50.549 --> 00:27:50.559 align:start position:0%
just the fines well right and uh you
 
00:27:50.559 --> 00:27:51.350 align:start position:0%
just the fines well right and uh you
know

00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:51.360 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:27:53.590 --> 00:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
they're also reducing sentences which i
 
00:27:55.430 --> 00:27:55.440 align:start position:0%
guess we don't address but we address
 
00:27:58.950 --> 00:27:58.960 align:start position:0%
the reduction of the fines uh
 
00:28:02.470 --> 00:28:02.480 align:start position:0%
so uh my only concern
 
00:28:06.310 --> 00:28:06.320 align:start position:0%
um is is
 
00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:09.360 align:start position:0%
we had in the testimony it was said this
 
00:28:11.430 --> 00:28:11.440 align:start position:0%
has nothing to do with drug dealers
 
00:28:13.750 --> 00:28:13.760 align:start position:0%
but it actually does is the more you
 
00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
read the
 
00:28:16.630 --> 00:28:16.640 align:start position:0%
uh to read it especially the first
 
00:28:19.110 --> 00:28:19.120 align:start position:0%
section uh
 
00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:21.760 align:start position:0%
it it does it reduces their from uh
 
00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:22.310 align:start position:0%
it it does it reduces their from uh
their

00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:22.320 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:28:24.070 --> 00:28:24.080 align:start position:0%
fines from five hundred thousand to
 
00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:26.640 align:start position:0%
three three hundred fifty thousand
 
00:28:28.549 --> 00:28:28.559 align:start position:0%
and then the rest of the bill is in
 
00:28:30.789 --> 00:28:30.799 align:start position:0%
increments it's in increments of
 
00:28:34.710 --> 00:28:34.720 align:start position:0%
quantity so as you go through this
 
00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
you can see um a certain drug
 
00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:40.480 align:start position:0%
if it's five ounces or more it's this
 
00:28:41.909 --> 00:28:41.919 align:start position:0%
fine if it's
 
00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
you know half that it's another fine
 
00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:48.720 align:start position:0%
um so i i'm a
 
00:28:54.389 --> 00:28:54.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:56.630 --> 00:28:56.640 align:start position:0%
i'm letting my own personal bias in here
 
00:28:58.070 --> 00:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
about i'm concerned about
 
00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:01.120 align:start position:0%
lowering some of these fines uh
 
00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:03.760 align:start position:0%
the other that's one number two as ways
 
00:29:04.870 --> 00:29:04.880 align:start position:0%
and means uh there's
 
00:29:07.590 --> 00:29:07.600 align:start position:0%
really no there's a fiscal note but
 
00:29:11.110 --> 00:29:11.120 align:start position:0%
there's no fiscal note on um
 
00:29:14.389 --> 00:29:14.399 align:start position:0%
on what this would do to the the fine
 
00:29:14.399 --> 00:29:15.909 align:start position:0%
on what this would do to the the fine
revenue

00:29:15.909 --> 00:29:15.919 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
00:29:19.590 --> 00:29:19.600 align:start position:0%
um you know and i understand
 
00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:22.240 align:start position:0%
that a lot of these fines are very large
 
00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:24.240 align:start position:0%
uh and it came out in the testimony that
 
00:29:27.909 --> 00:29:27.919 align:start position:0%
that many times the fines aren't paid
 
00:29:31.029 --> 00:29:31.039 align:start position:0%
uh i understand that but i think we'd
 
00:29:34.389 --> 00:29:34.399 align:start position:0%
need at least a sense of uh of what the
 
00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:35.200 align:start position:0%
impact is
 
00:29:38.789 --> 00:29:38.799 align:start position:0%
on the uh on the revenue if we can
 
00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh uh my my sense is that we should
 
00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
retain this bill
 
00:29:45.590 --> 00:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
that's just my a comment uh from my
 
00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:46.470 align:start position:0%
that's just my a comment uh from my
perspective

00:29:46.470 --> 00:29:46.480 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
00:29:49.269 --> 00:29:49.279 align:start position:0%
uh to allow us to uh to look at this a
 
00:29:50.870 --> 00:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
little more closely
 
00:29:53.909 --> 00:29:53.919 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:55.520 align:start position:0%
representative alame followed by
 
00:29:58.630 --> 00:29:58.640 align:start position:0%
representatives also
 
00:30:01.669 --> 00:30:01.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:04.640 align:start position:0%
my sense on this is that we have never
 
00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:05.840 align:start position:0%
dealt with the
 
00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:09.440 align:start position:0%
criminal fines partly because the fines
 
00:30:10.710 --> 00:30:10.720 align:start position:0%
were not supposed to be
 
00:30:13.110 --> 00:30:13.120 align:start position:0%
really related to revenue and in fact
 
00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:15.440 align:start position:0%
they produce almost no revenue
 
00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
for us partly because
 
00:30:21.669 --> 00:30:21.679 align:start position:0%
people frequently can't pay them and the
 
00:30:21.679 --> 00:30:23.909 align:start position:0%
people frequently can't pay them and the
judges

00:30:23.909 --> 00:30:23.919 align:start position:0%
judges
 
00:30:28.870 --> 00:30:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:31.760 align:start position:0%
and i think that what we're looking at
 
00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:32.149 align:start position:0%
and i think that what we're looking at
is

00:30:32.149 --> 00:30:32.159 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:30:34.470 --> 00:30:34.480 align:start position:0%
policy of criminal justice it shouldn't
 
00:30:35.510 --> 00:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
have come to us
 
00:30:38.630 --> 00:30:38.640 align:start position:0%
and that we ought to send it on to the
 
00:30:40.070 --> 00:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
senate and have
 
00:30:43.909 --> 00:30:43.919 align:start position:0%
the the different uh
 
00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:47.440 align:start position:0%
sides fight out the policy again
 
00:30:50.389 --> 00:30:50.399 align:start position:0%
in the senate which is probably going to
 
00:30:52.149 --> 00:30:52.159 align:start position:0%
have a different take on this
 
00:30:56.070 --> 00:30:56.080 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:30:59.350 --> 00:30:59.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman so
 
00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:02.320 align:start position:0%
again this has already passed the house
 
00:31:03.430 --> 00:31:03.440 align:start position:0%
i think it is
 
00:31:06.389 --> 00:31:06.399 align:start position:0%
mostly a policy bill and i'm just not
 
00:31:08.070 --> 00:31:08.080 align:start position:0%
sure what we could accomplish as a
 
00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:08.870 align:start position:0%
sure what we could accomplish as a
committee

00:31:08.870 --> 00:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:31:11.269 --> 00:31:11.279 align:start position:0%
really looking at the fines i believe
 
00:31:13.190 --> 00:31:13.200 align:start position:0%
there was testimony that judges
 
00:31:16.389 --> 00:31:16.399 align:start position:0%
are already going to the lower end
 
00:31:18.389 --> 00:31:18.399 align:start position:0%
so i would probably give it an opt to
 
00:31:20.070 --> 00:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
pass again it's not my favorite kind of
 
00:31:20.950 --> 00:31:20.960 align:start position:0%
bill either
 
00:31:24.389 --> 00:31:24.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:27.909 --> 00:31:27.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
anybody else want to weigh in on this
 
00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:37.360 align:start position:0%
all right then tomorrow uh was debating
 
00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:38.789 align:start position:0%
all right then tomorrow uh was debating
whether

00:31:38.789 --> 00:31:38.799 align:start position:0%
whether
 
00:31:48.549 --> 00:31:48.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:51.909 --> 00:31:51.919 align:start position:0%
the next is house bill 624
 
00:31:55.350 --> 00:31:55.360 align:start position:0%
decreasing the fee to file a petition
 
00:31:57.190 --> 00:31:57.200 align:start position:0%
for a declaratory ruling
 
00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:18.470 align:start position:0%
 
comments

00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:21.990 --> 00:32:22.000 align:start position:0%
thank you do we have on diane martin
 
00:32:25.430 --> 00:32:25.440 align:start position:0%
in the audience to talk to us again
 
00:32:29.350 --> 00:32:29.360 align:start position:0%
about what it means to file a petition
 
00:32:31.110 --> 00:32:31.120 align:start position:0%
for declaratory ruling
 
00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:35.440 align:start position:0%
and whether on this is an avenue
 
00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
that ordinary citizens which is what
 
00:32:41.269 --> 00:32:41.279 align:start position:0%
the bill was talking about giving access
 
00:32:41.279 --> 00:32:42.070 align:start position:0%
the bill was talking about giving access
to

00:32:42.070 --> 00:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:32:45.509 --> 00:32:45.519 align:start position:0%
would use as versus the petition to
 
00:32:49.909 --> 00:32:49.919 align:start position:0%
uh for a uh committee jurisdiction which
 
00:32:52.789 --> 00:32:52.799 align:start position:0%
already has what they were trying to
 
00:32:52.799 --> 00:32:53.430 align:start position:0%
already has what they were trying to
achieve

00:32:53.430 --> 00:32:53.440 align:start position:0%
achieve
 
00:32:56.070 --> 00:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
in it for ordinary citizens i think
 
00:32:56.870 --> 00:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
except that
 
00:33:00.870 --> 00:33:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:07.990 --> 00:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:11.190 --> 00:33:11.200 align:start position:0%
oh dear she's
 
00:33:17.909 --> 00:33:17.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:21.430 --> 00:33:21.440 align:start position:0%
she didn't talk to us before about that
 
00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
she she sent us this
 
00:33:32.070 --> 00:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:37.509 --> 00:33:37.519 align:start position:0%
and and i looked up a declaratory ruling
 
00:33:41.110 --> 00:33:41.120 align:start position:0%
in the statutes i had to search
 
00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
the entire statutes it appears
 
00:33:51.669 --> 00:33:51.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:56.070 --> 00:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
on administrative procedures 541a
 
00:33:59.269 --> 00:33:59.279 align:start position:0%
and it is for the entire government
 
00:34:03.029 --> 00:34:03.039 align:start position:0%
and it's when someone is
 
00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
is protesting an agency ruling
 
00:34:10.030 --> 00:34:10.040 align:start position:0%
on as to the specific
 
00:34:13.270 --> 00:34:13.280 align:start position:0%
applicability of any statutory provision
 
00:34:17.669 --> 00:34:17.679 align:start position:0%
of any rule or order of the agency
 
00:34:30.230 --> 00:34:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:33.030 --> 00:34:33.040 align:start position:0%
okay representative romney followed by
 
00:34:36.869 --> 00:34:36.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:40.389 --> 00:34:40.399 align:start position:0%
i can't recall maybe someone
 
00:34:44.629 --> 00:34:44.639 align:start position:0%
a member can uh answer this
 
00:34:48.069 --> 00:34:48.079 align:start position:0%
was there for this petition to be filed
 
00:34:51.669 --> 00:34:51.679 align:start position:0%
did it have to be a certain number of
 
00:34:54.550 --> 00:34:54.560 align:start position:0%
citizens or just except one person can
 
00:34:56.550 --> 00:34:56.560 align:start position:0%
do it
 
00:34:58.790 --> 00:34:58.800 align:start position:0%
does anybody recall that i could answer
 
00:35:00.829 --> 00:35:00.839 align:start position:0%
that if you want
 
00:35:04.150 --> 00:35:04.160 align:start position:0%
on in number one
 
00:35:08.230 --> 00:35:08.240 align:start position:0%
the petition for committee jurisdiction
 
00:35:12.230 --> 00:35:12.240 align:start position:0%
on there is a paragraph about that
 
00:35:15.829 --> 00:35:15.839 align:start position:0%
and as i read it it required a hundred
 
00:35:15.839 --> 00:35:16.550 align:start position:0%
and as i read it it required a hundred
citizens

00:35:16.550 --> 00:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
citizens
 
00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
to sign up in order to have a free
 
00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:22.790 align:start position:0%
to sign up in order to have a free
hearing

00:35:22.790 --> 00:35:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:24.240 align:start position:0%
so you need a hundred to have a free
 
00:35:26.710 --> 00:35:26.720 align:start position:0%
hearing okay that seemed like rather a
 
00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:27.270 align:start position:0%
hearing okay that seemed like rather a
lot

00:35:27.270 --> 00:35:27.280 align:start position:0%
lot
 
00:35:30.550 --> 00:35:30.560 align:start position:0%
yeah but if i could also add to that
 
00:35:34.390 --> 00:35:34.400 align:start position:0%
um it's it's one person for a
 
00:35:37.990 --> 00:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
request for a declaratory ruling
 
00:35:41.349 --> 00:35:41.359 align:start position:0%
just one person is there any
 
00:35:43.349 --> 00:35:43.359 align:start position:0%
qualifications to that dick
 
00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
on a butter or anything like that no
 
00:35:47.030 --> 00:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
just pay your fee
 
00:35:49.990 --> 00:35:50.000 align:start position:0%
just pay your fee okay now the only
 
00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:50.310 align:start position:0%
just pay your fee okay now the only
other

00:35:50.310 --> 00:35:50.320 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:35:52.870 --> 00:35:52.880 align:start position:0%
what the fee is what then well that's
 
00:35:56.230 --> 00:35:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:59.910 --> 00:35:59.920 align:start position:0%
so uh again they were
 
00:36:03.190 --> 00:36:03.200 align:start position:0%
from her testimony it sounds uh the note
 
00:36:05.510 --> 00:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
i have is that there were three of these
 
00:36:08.710 --> 00:36:08.720 align:start position:0%
filed since 2015 is
 
00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
my note so it doesn't it's not
 
00:36:14.630 --> 00:36:14.640 align:start position:0%
many but i guess with this it could open
 
00:36:15.589 --> 00:36:15.599 align:start position:0%
the floodgates to
 
00:36:21.910 --> 00:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:24.069 --> 00:36:24.079 align:start position:0%
if the the current fee structure was
 
00:36:26.390 --> 00:36:26.400 align:start position:0%
kept in place so
 
00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:28.720 align:start position:0%
so what we're talking about is whether
 
00:36:29.910 --> 00:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
we're going to have a
 
00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:34.720 align:start position:0%
fee uh no fee or a reduced fee
 
00:36:38.069 --> 00:36:38.079 align:start position:0%
for for these hearings if you ask
 
00:36:41.750 --> 00:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
for them not whether you can ask for
 
00:36:43.829 --> 00:36:43.839 align:start position:0%
them as a single person or not
 
00:36:49.030 --> 00:36:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:52.470 --> 00:36:52.480 align:start position:0%
now the fee is our decision the
 
00:36:56.069 --> 00:36:56.079 align:start position:0%
fee amount is our decision but the
 
00:36:59.670 --> 00:36:59.680 align:start position:0%
policy decision is whether
 
00:37:03.990 --> 00:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:05.440 align:start position:0%
yeah what i was trying to get at though
 
00:37:08.310 --> 00:37:08.320 align:start position:0%
my question or comment was you know for
 
00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:10.240 align:start position:0%
an individual
 
00:37:12.950 --> 00:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
uh you know ten thousand five hundred
 
00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
it's a lot
 
00:37:15.750 --> 00:37:15.760 align:start position:0%
uh if it's a group it's you know you
 
00:37:17.510 --> 00:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
could spread it over that
 
00:37:20.390 --> 00:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
and i know i mean the bill what we're
 
00:37:21.589 --> 00:37:21.599 align:start position:0%
addressing is one thing
 
00:37:24.790 --> 00:37:24.800 align:start position:0%
should we reduce that to 250 dollars
 
00:37:29.430 --> 00:37:29.440 align:start position:0%
that's all we're talking about here um
 
00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:32.560 align:start position:0%
and i guess we got a
 
00:37:34.870 --> 00:37:34.880 align:start position:0%
mr chair could i speak to this
 
00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:36.470 align:start position:0%
mr chair could i speak to this
representative

00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:37:39.589 --> 00:37:39.599 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah
 
00:37:42.230 --> 00:37:42.240 align:start position:0%
what what's being proposed the core of
 
00:37:42.870 --> 00:37:42.880 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
is to reduce the uh the current fee
 
00:37:50.550 --> 00:37:50.560 align:start position:0%
which is um
 
00:37:52.550 --> 00:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
either ten thousand five hundred dollars
 
00:37:53.910 --> 00:37:53.920 align:start position:0%
or three thousand
 
00:37:55.510 --> 00:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars depending on whether
 
00:37:57.349 --> 00:37:57.359 align:start position:0%
it's heard by the full
 
00:37:59.349 --> 00:37:59.359 align:start position:0%
committee which is the ten thousand five
 
00:38:01.030 --> 00:38:01.040 align:start position:0%
hundred dollar number or three thousand
 
00:38:02.829 --> 00:38:02.839 align:start position:0%
dollars if it's heard by a three-member
 
00:38:06.630 --> 00:38:06.640 align:start position:0%
sub-committee and
 
00:38:09.910 --> 00:38:09.920 align:start position:0%
reducing that down to 250
 
00:38:13.030 --> 00:38:13.040 align:start position:0%
so um it seems to me
 
00:38:16.069 --> 00:38:16.079 align:start position:0%
looking at this that the
 
00:38:20.790 --> 00:38:20.800 align:start position:0%
from a policy perspective the uh
 
00:38:23.670 --> 00:38:23.680 align:start position:0%
the choice that's represented by this
 
00:38:24.470 --> 00:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
change is
 
00:38:29.109 --> 00:38:29.119 align:start position:0%
to open up this option to get a ruling
 
00:38:32.150 --> 00:38:32.160 align:start position:0%
a declaratory ruling
 
00:38:35.190 --> 00:38:35.200 align:start position:0%
make it easier to access that
 
00:38:38.630 --> 00:38:38.640 align:start position:0%
opportunity by reducing the
 
00:38:40.150 --> 00:38:40.160 align:start position:0%
rate it seems to me that that is a
 
00:38:42.310 --> 00:38:42.320 align:start position:0%
policy judgment
 
00:38:45.349 --> 00:38:45.359 align:start position:0%
right it did occur to me
 
00:38:48.550 --> 00:38:48.560 align:start position:0%
that to the extent to which ways and
 
00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:49.750 align:start position:0%
that to the extent to which ways and
means

00:38:49.750 --> 00:38:49.760 align:start position:0%
means
 
00:38:53.510 --> 00:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
can second guess that
 
00:38:55.750 --> 00:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
judgment because it does cross over into
 
00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:58.630 align:start position:0%
judgment because it does cross over into
fees

00:38:58.630 --> 00:38:58.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:02.150 --> 00:39:02.160 align:start position:0%
it uh would make sense to me
 
00:39:04.550 --> 00:39:04.560 align:start position:0%
um sort of responding to the concern
 
00:39:06.390 --> 00:39:06.400 align:start position:0%
that this may open the floodgates
 
00:39:08.870 --> 00:39:08.880 align:start position:0%
so to speak or gum up the works whatever
 
00:39:10.710 --> 00:39:10.720 align:start position:0%
expression you want to use
 
00:39:15.910 --> 00:39:15.920 align:start position:0%
um that they're we ensure that there is
 
00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:19.200 align:start position:0%
a provision or existing capacity
 
00:39:22.310 --> 00:39:22.320 align:start position:0%
for the sec to
 
00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:26.640 align:start position:0%
dismiss summarily those petitions that
 
00:39:29.589 --> 00:39:29.599 align:start position:0%
it finds to be either redundant or
 
00:39:29.599 --> 00:39:31.589 align:start position:0%
it finds to be either redundant or
frivolous

00:39:31.589 --> 00:39:31.599 align:start position:0%
frivolous
 
00:39:34.470 --> 00:39:34.480 align:start position:0%
so that the sec could pull itself out of
 
00:39:37.510 --> 00:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
a situation where there's a cascade of
 
00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
petitions that are
 
00:39:44.310 --> 00:39:44.320 align:start position:0%
essentially coming up the works um now
 
00:39:45.910 --> 00:39:45.920 align:start position:0%
i don't know i haven't had time we
 
00:39:47.670 --> 00:39:47.680 align:start position:0%
haven't had time to
 
00:39:50.950 --> 00:39:50.960 align:start position:0%
look at sec's procedures i don't think
 
00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:51.430 align:start position:0%
look at sec's procedures i don't think
we've

00:39:51.430 --> 00:39:51.440 align:start position:0%
we've
 
00:39:56.470 --> 00:39:56.480 align:start position:0%
got anybody here in the uh
 
00:39:59.750 --> 00:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
panel in the attendee list who can speak
 
00:40:00.390 --> 00:40:00.400 align:start position:0%
to this
 
00:40:03.430 --> 00:40:03.440 align:start position:0%
whether the sec already has that
 
00:40:05.430 --> 00:40:05.440 align:start position:0%
authority but i think that's an
 
00:40:07.510 --> 00:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
important part of reducing a fee like
 
00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:08.390 align:start position:0%
important part of reducing a fee like
this

00:40:08.390 --> 00:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:40:11.430 --> 00:40:11.440 align:start position:0%
that the sec should have the tools
 
00:40:13.670 --> 00:40:13.680 align:start position:0%
that it may need in particular
 
00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:14.710 align:start position:0%
that it may need in particular
situations

00:40:14.710 --> 00:40:14.720 align:start position:0%
situations
 
00:40:17.750 --> 00:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
to to go on with this business and not
 
00:40:19.510 --> 00:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
end up spending an enormous amount of
 
00:40:21.349 --> 00:40:21.359 align:start position:0%
money um
 
00:40:23.670 --> 00:40:23.680 align:start position:0%
because a lot of people now find it easy
 
00:40:25.030 --> 00:40:25.040 align:start position:0%
to file
 
00:40:27.430 --> 00:40:27.440 align:start position:0%
uh petitions on a single issue a hot
 
00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:29.510 align:start position:0%
uh petitions on a single issue a hot
issue

00:40:29.510 --> 00:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:40:31.910 --> 00:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
you make a good point representative
 
00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:34.150 align:start position:0%
you make a good point representative
ames

00:40:34.150 --> 00:40:34.160 align:start position:0%
ames
 
00:40:37.030 --> 00:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
that in order to get that information
 
00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:37.750 align:start position:0%
that in order to get that information
without

00:40:37.750 --> 00:40:37.760 align:start position:0%
without
 
00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:40.240 align:start position:0%
somebody representing the sec that
 
00:40:41.829 --> 00:40:41.839 align:start position:0%
understands it
 
00:40:45.030 --> 00:40:45.040 align:start position:0%
to be able to explain it to us
 
00:40:47.750 --> 00:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
and if that's the case then it probably
 
00:40:49.190 --> 00:40:49.200 align:start position:0%
would be a
 
00:40:52.230 --> 00:40:52.240 align:start position:0%
fine candidate for retaining
 
00:40:56.309 --> 00:40:56.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:58.630 --> 00:40:58.640 align:start position:0%
uh represented uh you're already
 
00:41:00.550 --> 00:41:00.560 align:start position:0%
followed by spillsboro and
 
00:41:04.630 --> 00:41:04.640 align:start position:0%
denise representatively
 
00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
oh thank you mr chair i wanted to uh
 
00:41:10.950 --> 00:41:10.960 align:start position:0%
i don't know i don't like doing this too
 
00:41:13.270 --> 00:41:13.280 align:start position:0%
often but
 
00:41:15.030 --> 00:41:15.040 align:start position:0%
if you would take a look at the new
 
00:41:16.790 --> 00:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire constitution
 
00:41:19.109 --> 00:41:19.119 align:start position:0%
um maybe representative ames can correct
 
00:41:20.630 --> 00:41:20.640 align:start position:0%
me if i'm wrong
 
00:41:24.069 --> 00:41:24.079 align:start position:0%
but we modified part one article eight
 
00:41:28.470 --> 00:41:28.480 align:start position:0%
in 2018 providing that standards
 
00:41:31.349 --> 00:41:31.359 align:start position:0%
providing the taxpayers have standing to
 
00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
bring actions against the government
 
00:41:38.309 --> 00:41:38.319 align:start position:0%
and then again in article 14
 
00:41:40.390 --> 00:41:40.400 align:start position:0%
it says that legal remedies are to be
 
00:41:41.430 --> 00:41:41.440 align:start position:0%
free complete
 
00:41:44.710 --> 00:41:44.720 align:start position:0%
and prompt so when we're talking about
 
00:41:46.630 --> 00:41:46.640 align:start position:0%
setting a ten thousand dollar
 
00:41:51.829 --> 00:41:51.839 align:start position:0%
piling fee to get uh
 
00:41:54.630 --> 00:41:54.640 align:start position:0%
what's that called a um presumptive uh
 
00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:55.109 align:start position:0%
what's that called a um presumptive uh
hearing

00:41:55.109 --> 00:41:55.119 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
00:41:58.309 --> 00:41:58.319 align:start position:0%
or uh on a decline
 
00:42:00.309 --> 00:42:00.319 align:start position:0%
yeah declaratory thank you a
 
00:42:01.430 --> 00:42:01.440 align:start position:0%
representative said
 
00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:04.800 align:start position:0%
skip me for a moment to get a
 
00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:05.829 align:start position:0%
skip me for a moment to get a
declaratory

00:42:05.829 --> 00:42:05.839 align:start position:0%
declaratory
 
00:42:09.030 --> 00:42:09.040 align:start position:0%
ruling are we in fact
 
00:42:12.150 --> 00:42:12.160 align:start position:0%
violating both article 8 as
 
00:42:15.510 --> 00:42:15.520 align:start position:0%
it was changed in 2018 and
 
00:42:18.870 --> 00:42:18.880 align:start position:0%
article 14 which says that it needs to
 
00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
be at least
 
00:42:22.790 --> 00:42:22.800 align:start position:0%
free to a degree um
 
00:42:25.270 --> 00:42:25.280 align:start position:0%
well it actually in article 14 it says
 
00:42:26.790 --> 00:42:26.800 align:start position:0%
free period
 
00:42:31.829 --> 00:42:31.839 align:start position:0%
but we've put in filing fees and
 
00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:34.240 align:start position:0%
exemptions for that and stuff like that
 
00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:36.240 align:start position:0%
you know that's what we do
 
00:42:39.510 --> 00:42:39.520 align:start position:0%
but i i think we need to take those into
 
00:42:41.589 --> 00:42:41.599 align:start position:0%
consideration when we're setting a
 
00:42:44.309 --> 00:42:44.319 align:start position:0%
ten thousand dollar filing fee
 
00:42:45.510 --> 00:42:45.520 align:start position:0%
regardless of what
 
00:42:48.950 --> 00:42:48.960 align:start position:0%
sec wants to put down um
 
00:42:53.589 --> 00:42:53.599 align:start position:0%
ten cents thank you representative
 
00:42:56.870 --> 00:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
uh yes thank you mr chairman so
 
00:42:59.430 --> 00:42:59.440 align:start position:0%
at the current fee level there have
 
00:43:00.950 --> 00:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
apparently only been three
 
00:43:03.349 --> 00:43:03.359 align:start position:0%
declaratory rulings requested in the
 
00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
last five years
 
00:43:07.589 --> 00:43:07.599 align:start position:0%
so from a revenue perspective this is
 
00:43:09.829 --> 00:43:09.839 align:start position:0%
absolutely negligible
 
00:43:12.470 --> 00:43:12.480 align:start position:0%
and i don't think that the ways and
 
00:43:14.630 --> 00:43:14.640 align:start position:0%
means committee should step in and
 
00:43:17.829 --> 00:43:17.839 align:start position:0%
meddle i think this one gets a pass
 
00:43:20.309 --> 00:43:20.319 align:start position:0%
in deference to the policy committee it
 
00:43:21.349 --> 00:43:21.359 align:start position:0%
was passed on
 
00:43:23.349 --> 00:43:23.359 align:start position:0%
february 24th on a voice vote on the
 
00:43:23.359 --> 00:43:24.470 align:start position:0%
february 24th on a voice vote on the
floor

00:43:24.470 --> 00:43:24.480 align:start position:0%
floor
 
00:43:28.470 --> 00:43:28.480 align:start position:0%
so i'm ready to let it go forward
 
00:43:32.230 --> 00:43:32.240 align:start position:0%
representative thank you mr chairman
 
00:43:34.630 --> 00:43:34.640 align:start position:0%
i guess my concern i understand that the
 
00:43:35.829 --> 00:43:35.839 align:start position:0%
policy committee
 
00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:38.160 align:start position:0%
has made a ruling on this but i guess
 
00:43:39.589 --> 00:43:39.599 align:start position:0%
the one thing that has bothered me
 
00:43:39.599 --> 00:43:39.990 align:start position:0%
the one thing that has bothered me
throughout

00:43:39.990 --> 00:43:40.000 align:start position:0%
throughout
 
00:43:42.550 --> 00:43:42.560 align:start position:0%
this is that there was a ten thousand
 
00:43:44.630 --> 00:43:44.640 align:start position:0%
dollar or ten thousand five hundred if
 
00:43:46.230 --> 00:43:46.240 align:start position:0%
the full committee
 
00:43:49.270 --> 00:43:49.280 align:start position:0%
uh made a declaratory ruling
 
00:43:50.950 --> 00:43:50.960 align:start position:0%
and three thousand if it was a
 
00:43:53.190 --> 00:43:53.200 align:start position:0%
three-member panel
 
00:43:56.870 --> 00:43:56.880 align:start position:0%
yes there were only three judgments but
 
00:43:58.630 --> 00:43:58.640 align:start position:0%
you know are we opening is it going to
 
00:44:00.950 --> 00:44:00.960 align:start position:0%
open the floodgates and if so
 
00:44:02.950 --> 00:44:02.960 align:start position:0%
it makes no sense to me it's never made
 
00:44:04.470 --> 00:44:04.480 align:start position:0%
sense to me that
 
00:44:07.190 --> 00:44:07.200 align:start position:0%
it's the same price 250 whether it's the
 
00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:08.470 align:start position:0%
it's the same price 250 whether it's the
whole

00:44:08.470 --> 00:44:08.480 align:start position:0%
whole
 
00:44:10.230 --> 00:44:10.240 align:start position:0%
committee or it's only a three-member
 
00:44:11.829 --> 00:44:11.839 align:start position:0%
committee i mean to me
 
00:44:14.470 --> 00:44:14.480 align:start position:0%
i guess i would vote to retain because i
 
00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:15.109 align:start position:0%
i guess i would vote to retain because i
think

00:44:15.109 --> 00:44:15.119 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:44:17.750 --> 00:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
we need to look at these fees and maybe
 
00:44:19.270 --> 00:44:19.280 align:start position:0%
you know obviously the policy committee
 
00:44:21.510 --> 00:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
has decided it should be lower
 
00:44:25.190 --> 00:44:25.200 align:start position:0%
but maybe it should be um you know 3 000
 
00:44:27.430 --> 00:44:27.440 align:start position:0%
if the whole committee hears it and and
 
00:44:29.109 --> 00:44:29.119 align:start position:0%
i don't know 500 if
 
00:44:31.670 --> 00:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
or 250 if it's a three-member panel but
 
00:44:33.190 --> 00:44:33.200 align:start position:0%
we do know
 
00:44:36.150 --> 00:44:36.160 align:start position:0%
uh through the testimony that the cost
 
00:44:37.349 --> 00:44:37.359 align:start position:0%
of the hearing
 
00:44:40.470 --> 00:44:40.480 align:start position:0%
would outweigh the um the fee certainly
 
00:44:42.309 --> 00:44:42.319 align:start position:0%
if it's lowered so
 
00:44:44.710 --> 00:44:44.720 align:start position:0%
i think i i would i would vote to retain
 
00:44:47.190 --> 00:44:47.200 align:start position:0%
and and reassess these fees and have
 
00:44:49.430 --> 00:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
a fee for the full member panel and a
 
00:44:51.670 --> 00:44:51.680 align:start position:0%
fee for the three-member panel
 
00:44:56.550 --> 00:44:56.560 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:44:59.670 --> 00:44:59.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman on i would like to
 
00:45:01.430 --> 00:45:01.440 align:start position:0%
know from the lawyers
 
00:45:03.750 --> 00:45:03.760 align:start position:0%
whether they feel that the
 
00:45:06.470 --> 00:45:06.480 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment that we passed
 
00:45:09.750 --> 00:45:09.760 align:start position:0%
refers only to our court system or
 
00:45:12.390 --> 00:45:12.400 align:start position:0%
also to all of our regulatory agencies
 
00:45:13.990 --> 00:45:14.000 align:start position:0%
in which case
 
00:45:15.829 --> 00:45:15.839 align:start position:0%
we are going to have to dedicate a lot
 
00:45:18.230 --> 00:45:18.240 align:start position:0%
more general funds to those regulatory
 
00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:19.430 align:start position:0%
more general funds to those regulatory
agencies

00:45:19.430 --> 00:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
00:45:23.109 --> 00:45:23.119 align:start position:0%
in order to replace the fees
 
00:45:26.550 --> 00:45:26.560 align:start position:0%
that that they charge on
 
00:45:29.670 --> 00:45:29.680 align:start position:0%
this fee was based on the idea
 
00:45:32.790 --> 00:45:32.800 align:start position:0%
that the fact that if they have a full
 
00:45:36.710 --> 00:45:36.720 align:start position:0%
committee commission uh hearing
 
00:45:38.950 --> 00:45:38.960 align:start position:0%
they have to pay for i think it's three
 
00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:40.309 align:start position:0%
they have to pay for i think it's three
commissioners

00:45:40.309 --> 00:45:40.319 align:start position:0%
commissioners
 
00:45:42.309 --> 00:45:42.319 align:start position:0%
at commission level they can't send
 
00:45:42.319 --> 00:45:43.430 align:start position:0%
at commission level they can't send
delegates

00:45:43.430 --> 00:45:43.440 align:start position:0%
delegates
 
00:45:46.630 --> 00:45:46.640 align:start position:0%
uh as well as a number of other people
 
00:45:49.510 --> 00:45:49.520 align:start position:0%
to come and spend maybe days on
 
00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:50.710 align:start position:0%
to come and spend maybe days on
something

00:45:50.710 --> 00:45:50.720 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:45:54.150 --> 00:45:54.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:57.670 --> 00:45:57.680 align:start position:0%
we should when we look at fees
 
00:46:00.550 --> 00:46:00.560 align:start position:0%
both look at what can be afforded and
 
00:46:00.560 --> 00:46:01.349 align:start position:0%
both look at what can be afforded and
look

00:46:01.349 --> 00:46:01.359 align:start position:0%
look
 
00:46:06.150 --> 00:46:06.160 align:start position:0%
at on what pays for the service
 
00:46:07.670 --> 00:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
that's what a fee is supposed to be
 
00:46:09.349 --> 00:46:09.359 align:start position:0%
doing it's supposed to pay for
 
00:46:12.710 --> 00:46:12.720 align:start position:0%
the service on and
 
00:46:16.390 --> 00:46:16.400 align:start position:0%
in this case what pays for the service
 
00:46:18.069 --> 00:46:18.079 align:start position:0%
seems to be this very
 
00:46:20.069 --> 00:46:20.079 align:start position:0%
large amount because of the way the rest
 
00:46:22.309 --> 00:46:22.319 align:start position:0%
of the statute was written
 
00:46:25.190 --> 00:46:25.200 align:start position:0%
so um but i would like to see what the
 
00:46:26.870 --> 00:46:26.880 align:start position:0%
lawyers have to say about
 
00:46:29.990 --> 00:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
the regulatory agencies being being
 
00:46:31.990 --> 00:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
affected by the constitutional amendment
 
00:46:33.430 --> 00:46:33.440 align:start position:0%
we passed that
 
00:46:36.550 --> 00:46:36.560 align:start position:0%
i at least was thinking about as uh
 
00:46:40.069 --> 00:46:40.079 align:start position:0%
on the court system itself i think
 
00:46:43.109 --> 00:46:43.119 align:start position:0%
thank you susan any any other
 
00:46:43.119 --> 00:46:46.550 align:start position:0%
thank you susan any any other
comments

00:46:46.550 --> 00:46:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:50.550 --> 00:46:50.560 align:start position:0%
i'm 6 24 represent early
 
00:46:53.829 --> 00:46:53.839 align:start position:0%
now i was just going to thank
 
00:46:56.069 --> 00:46:56.079 align:start position:0%
representative ames for that comment
 
00:46:58.390 --> 00:46:58.400 align:start position:0%
yeah um
 
00:46:59.910 --> 00:46:59.920 align:start position:0%
i don't think that has uh been
 
00:47:02.150 --> 00:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
determined by the supreme court as yet
 
00:47:03.510 --> 00:47:03.520 align:start position:0%
although they
 
00:47:05.750 --> 00:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
you know the reason we put that in is
 
00:47:06.870 --> 00:47:06.880 align:start position:0%
because they uh
 
00:47:10.309 --> 00:47:10.319 align:start position:0%
had stated that uh uh the house of
 
00:47:12.069 --> 00:47:12.079 align:start position:0%
representatives didn't have standing
 
00:47:13.430 --> 00:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
before the court
 
00:47:14.950 --> 00:47:14.960 align:start position:0%
well it seems to me that the house of
 
00:47:16.790 --> 00:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
representatives should have
 
00:47:20.069 --> 00:47:20.079 align:start position:0%
and the senate individually and jointly
 
00:47:22.069 --> 00:47:22.079 align:start position:0%
should have standing in everything but
 
00:47:24.230 --> 00:47:24.240 align:start position:0%
that's why that was put through if i
 
00:47:26.230 --> 00:47:26.240 align:start position:0%
remember the discussion
 
00:47:29.190 --> 00:47:29.200 align:start position:0%
um on it but it would be nice to know
 
00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:30.069 align:start position:0%
um on it but it would be nice to know
whether

00:47:30.069 --> 00:47:30.079 align:start position:0%
whether
 
00:47:32.950 --> 00:47:32.960 align:start position:0%
this is applying to uh agencies because
 
00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:33.349 align:start position:0%
this is applying to uh agencies because
uh

00:47:33.349 --> 00:47:33.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:47:35.589 --> 00:47:35.599 align:start position:0%
representative ames is correct it's
 
00:47:37.030 --> 00:47:37.040 align:start position:0%
going to cost more
 
00:47:42.150 --> 00:47:42.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:45.990 --> 00:47:46.000 align:start position:0%
seeking quote-unquote justice uh from
 
00:47:50.829 --> 00:47:50.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:55.030 --> 00:47:55.040 align:start position:0%
uh we have to pay a fee to
 
00:47:55.040 --> 00:47:59.589 align:start position:0%
uh we have to pay a fee to
exist

00:47:59.589 --> 00:47:59.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:01.190 --> 00:48:01.200 align:start position:0%
representative romney followed by
 
00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:03.109 align:start position:0%
representative romney followed by
representatives

00:48:03.109 --> 00:48:03.119 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
00:48:06.230 --> 00:48:06.240 align:start position:0%
um my sense is that i
 
00:48:07.510 --> 00:48:07.520 align:start position:0%
may have been something that was said in
 
00:48:10.150 --> 00:48:10.160 align:start position:0%
the hearing is that
 
00:48:12.870 --> 00:48:12.880 align:start position:0%
these fees don't cover the costs that
 
00:48:14.230 --> 00:48:14.240 align:start position:0%
some of the money comes out of the
 
00:48:16.309 --> 00:48:16.319 align:start position:0%
general fund i guess
 
00:48:19.990 --> 00:48:20.000 align:start position:0%
into their budget to the site evaluation
 
00:48:23.670 --> 00:48:23.680 align:start position:0%
committee uh budget to cover the costs
 
00:48:26.470 --> 00:48:26.480 align:start position:0%
uh what we don't know the other thing we
 
00:48:27.990 --> 00:48:28.000 align:start position:0%
do know is that
 
00:48:30.309 --> 00:48:30.319 align:start position:0%
uh these whether it's a three-member
 
00:48:31.750 --> 00:48:31.760 align:start position:0%
panel or the full
 
00:48:34.870 --> 00:48:34.880 align:start position:0%
uh the full board or whatever
 
00:48:38.470 --> 00:48:38.480 align:start position:0%
that some members are employees of the
 
00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:38.950 align:start position:0%
that some members are employees of the
state

00:48:38.950 --> 00:48:38.960 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:48:41.589 --> 00:48:41.599 align:start position:0%
in our own salary so those costs are
 
00:48:43.270 --> 00:48:43.280 align:start position:0%
already fixed those costs are already in
 
00:48:44.710 --> 00:48:44.720 align:start position:0%
the in their budget
 
00:48:47.270 --> 00:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
and then others are outside members and
 
00:48:48.390 --> 00:48:48.400 align:start position:0%
what we just don't know
 
00:48:51.190 --> 00:48:51.200 align:start position:0%
is and i'm sure these hearings are of
 
00:48:52.470 --> 00:48:52.480 align:start position:0%
different lengths
 
00:48:54.470 --> 00:48:54.480 align:start position:0%
so we just don't know what the actual
 
00:48:55.670 --> 00:48:55.680 align:start position:0%
cost is here
 
00:48:58.710 --> 00:48:58.720 align:start position:0%
i'll just throw that out as it may be a
 
00:49:00.150 --> 00:49:00.160 align:start position:0%
reason to
 
00:49:02.630 --> 00:49:02.640 align:start position:0%
to retain to try to understand a little
 
00:49:03.990 --> 00:49:04.000 align:start position:0%
better if we really want to dig into
 
00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:04.950 align:start position:0%
better if we really want to dig into
this

00:49:04.950 --> 00:49:04.960 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:49:08.069 --> 00:49:08.079 align:start position:0%
uh how close is the current
 
00:49:11.109 --> 00:49:11.119 align:start position:0%
the current fee structure to
 
00:49:13.589 --> 00:49:13.599 align:start position:0%
what the actual cost is of uh performing
 
00:49:13.599 --> 00:49:14.870 align:start position:0%
what the actual cost is of uh performing
this

00:49:14.870 --> 00:49:14.880 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:49:17.910 --> 00:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
uh that's just a comment mr chair
 
00:49:20.390 --> 00:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
representative uh ames followed by
 
00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:23.829 align:start position:0%
representative uh ames followed by
representative

00:49:23.829 --> 00:49:23.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:26.950 --> 00:49:26.960 align:start position:0%
yeah i i thought i should at least say a
 
00:49:30.069 --> 00:49:30.079 align:start position:0%
few words in response to
 
00:49:32.630 --> 00:49:32.640 align:start position:0%
uh representative ulrich and represents
 
00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:34.470 align:start position:0%
uh representative ulrich and represents
almi's

00:49:34.470 --> 00:49:34.480 align:start position:0%
almi's
 
00:49:37.670 --> 00:49:37.680 align:start position:0%
request and i don't want to pretend
 
00:49:41.349 --> 00:49:41.359 align:start position:0%
expertise here that i don't have
 
00:49:44.549 --> 00:49:44.559 align:start position:0%
and the question is of
 
00:49:47.430 --> 00:49:47.440 align:start position:0%
the effect of the constitutional recent
 
00:49:48.710 --> 00:49:48.720 align:start position:0%
relatively recent
 
00:49:50.710 --> 00:49:50.720 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment i think that
 
00:49:53.589 --> 00:49:53.599 align:start position:0%
was directed at taxpayer
 
00:49:57.109 --> 00:49:57.119 align:start position:0%
standing to bring cases in court
 
00:49:58.720 --> 00:49:58.730 align:start position:0%
and that
 
00:49:58.730 --> 00:50:00.470 align:start position:0%
and that
[Music]

00:50:00.470 --> 00:50:00.480 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:50:03.109 --> 00:50:03.119 align:start position:0%
essentially acted as a reversal of uh
 
00:50:03.119 --> 00:50:03.670 align:start position:0%
essentially acted as a reversal of uh
recent

00:50:03.670 --> 00:50:03.680 align:start position:0%
recent
 
00:50:05.430 --> 00:50:05.440 align:start position:0%
rulings that had made it more difficult
 
00:50:07.109 --> 00:50:07.119 align:start position:0%
for taxpayers to
 
00:50:09.990 --> 00:50:10.000 align:start position:0%
gain standing to challenge this that or
 
00:50:12.150 --> 00:50:12.160 align:start position:0%
the other thing
 
00:50:15.109 --> 00:50:15.119 align:start position:0%
and so we're talking about a different
 
00:50:16.950 --> 00:50:16.960 align:start position:0%
scene here
 
00:50:20.230 --> 00:50:20.240 align:start position:0%
regulatory agencies
 
00:50:23.349 --> 00:50:23.359 align:start position:0%
perhaps there's some aspect of that
 
00:50:23.359 --> 00:50:23.990 align:start position:0%
perhaps there's some aspect of that
amendment

00:50:23.990 --> 00:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:50:27.510 --> 00:50:27.520 align:start position:0%
that strengthens the
 
00:50:30.710 --> 00:50:30.720 align:start position:0%
the case for an individual to be able to
 
00:50:33.109 --> 00:50:33.119 align:start position:0%
get before a regulatory agency but i
 
00:50:33.910 --> 00:50:33.920 align:start position:0%
think it's
 
00:50:37.030 --> 00:50:37.040 align:start position:0%
it's that vague and and you know who
 
00:50:38.870 --> 00:50:38.880 align:start position:0%
knows how the court would rule on that i
 
00:50:39.990 --> 00:50:40.000 align:start position:0%
think we just need to look
 
00:50:43.270 --> 00:50:43.280 align:start position:0%
straight head on at this particular
 
00:50:46.470 --> 00:50:46.480 align:start position:0%
provision and and
 
00:50:48.790 --> 00:50:48.800 align:start position:0%
deal with it as is and not get uh not
 
00:50:51.430 --> 00:50:51.440 align:start position:0%
get sidetracked by
 
00:50:53.430 --> 00:50:53.440 align:start position:0%
speculation which is essentially what it
 
00:50:55.270 --> 00:50:55.280 align:start position:0%
has to be
 
00:50:59.589 --> 00:50:59.599 align:start position:0%
as to the import of recent or
 
00:51:03.270 --> 00:51:03.280 align:start position:0%
ancient constitutional provisions
 
00:51:04.950 --> 00:51:04.960 align:start position:0%
that can only be interpreted
 
00:51:12.549 --> 00:51:12.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:16.230 --> 00:51:16.240 align:start position:0%
thank you i also asked division one
 
00:51:19.589 --> 00:51:19.599 align:start position:0%
about the sec budget they
 
00:51:23.030 --> 00:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
uh in in the budget at this point
 
00:51:26.150 --> 00:51:26.160 align:start position:0%
they have taken all general funding away
 
00:51:29.030 --> 00:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
from the sec and told them to raise
 
00:51:30.870 --> 00:51:30.880 align:start position:0%
their own money
 
00:51:33.750 --> 00:51:33.760 align:start position:0%
on by which they seem to mean that
 
00:51:35.349 --> 00:51:35.359 align:start position:0%
they're going to be playing with their
 
00:51:36.790 --> 00:51:36.800 align:start position:0%
own fees
 
00:51:39.910 --> 00:51:39.920 align:start position:0%
on this and they
 
00:51:42.230 --> 00:51:42.240 align:start position:0%
and i discovered when i looked at the
 
00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:43.190 align:start position:0%
and i discovered when i looked at the
amendments

00:51:43.190 --> 00:51:43.200 align:start position:0%
amendments
 
00:51:47.030 --> 00:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
on hb1 they still have an asterisk on
 
00:51:47.990 --> 00:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
the sec
 
00:51:49.910 --> 00:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
saying if you can't raise enough you can
 
00:51:51.589 --> 00:51:51.599 align:start position:0%
come to the fiscal committee and try to
 
00:51:53.349 --> 00:51:53.359 align:start position:0%
get some more money
 
00:51:57.270 --> 00:51:57.280 align:start position:0%
um so what that
 
00:52:01.109 --> 00:52:01.119 align:start position:0%
the department of energy which is 40
 
00:52:04.950 --> 00:52:04.960 align:start position:0%
of hb2 is on
 
00:52:07.829 --> 00:52:07.839 align:start position:0%
messing completely with everything to do
 
00:52:09.349 --> 00:52:09.359 align:start position:0%
with energy including
 
00:52:12.630 --> 00:52:12.640 align:start position:0%
all of the puc the sec everything
 
00:52:14.150 --> 00:52:14.160 align:start position:0%
we've been talking about in those two
 
00:52:16.790 --> 00:52:16.800 align:start position:0%
bills and until that is
 
00:52:18.549 --> 00:52:18.559 align:start position:0%
ironed out at the end of the budget
 
00:52:21.270 --> 00:52:21.280 align:start position:0%
process i don't think if we're going to
 
00:52:22.470 --> 00:52:22.480 align:start position:0%
be looking at
 
00:52:24.870 --> 00:52:24.880 align:start position:0%
on this service is supposed to be
 
00:52:26.309 --> 00:52:26.319 align:start position:0%
performed how
 
00:52:29.430 --> 00:52:29.440 align:start position:0%
how how do you handle the fees for it i
 
00:52:30.390 --> 00:52:30.400 align:start position:0%
don't think we can
 
00:52:32.230 --> 00:52:32.240 align:start position:0%
deal with that we don't have no idea
 
00:52:33.589 --> 00:52:33.599 align:start position:0%
what's going to come out at the end of
 
00:52:34.549 --> 00:52:34.559 align:start position:0%
the budget
 
00:52:38.470 --> 00:52:38.480 align:start position:0%
thing thank you representative
 
00:52:44.829 --> 00:52:44.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:44.839 --> 00:52:47.910 align:start position:0%
 
then

00:52:47.910 --> 00:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:51.190 --> 00:52:51.200 align:start position:0%
deal with that tomorrow and
 
00:52:53.190 --> 00:52:53.200 align:start position:0%
i would imagine representing you're
 
00:52:55.190 --> 00:52:55.200 align:start position:0%
going to be having a caucus of your
 
00:52:55.200 --> 00:52:56.549 align:start position:0%
going to be having a caucus of your
members

00:52:56.549 --> 00:52:56.559 align:start position:0%
members
 
00:52:58.790 --> 00:52:58.800 align:start position:0%
today we'll be having our caucus this
 
00:53:01.030 --> 00:53:01.040 align:start position:0%
afternoon of our members
 
00:53:05.030 --> 00:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
i'm going to try i haven't heard yet on
 
00:53:07.670 --> 00:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
from more than one of them whether they
 
00:53:08.950 --> 00:53:08.960 align:start position:0%
could come and when
 
00:53:13.190 --> 00:53:13.200 align:start position:0%
i can't be there after three o'clock
 
00:53:16.150 --> 00:53:16.160 align:start position:0%
okay well if we're through early enough
 
00:53:16.160 --> 00:53:17.990 align:start position:0%
okay well if we're through early enough
today

00:53:17.990 --> 00:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:53:23.109 --> 00:53:23.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:25.750 --> 00:53:25.760 align:start position:0%
for the next group of the senate bills
 
00:53:26.390 --> 00:53:26.400 align:start position:0%
that we
 
00:53:33.829 --> 00:53:33.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:59.270 --> 00:53:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:01.510 --> 00:54:01.520 align:start position:0%
the longer we're at this the more paper
 
00:54:03.349 --> 00:54:03.359 align:start position:0%
we generate
 
00:54:22.829 --> 00:54:22.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:22.839 --> 00:54:24.309 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:54:24.309 --> 00:54:24.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:54:32.549 --> 00:54:32.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:37.430 --> 00:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:43.589 --> 00:54:43.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:46.150 --> 00:54:46.160 align:start position:0%
do we need any more information to make
 
00:54:46.870 --> 00:54:46.880 align:start position:0%
a decision
 
00:54:50.829 --> 00:54:50.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:50.839 --> 00:54:55.030 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:54:55.030 --> 00:54:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:58.069 --> 00:54:58.079 align:start position:0%
and senate bill top 22 that's all it
 
00:54:58.079 --> 00:54:58.630 align:start position:0%
and senate bill top 22 that's all it
says

00:54:58.630 --> 00:54:58.640 align:start position:0%
says
 
00:55:02.230 --> 00:55:02.240 align:start position:0%
to the second seven tickets it allows
 
00:55:05.670 --> 00:55:05.680 align:start position:0%
the play of elected like the seven
 
00:55:08.069 --> 00:55:08.079 align:start position:0%
games sets a limit for elected seven
 
00:55:09.430 --> 00:55:09.440 align:start position:0%
deal size
 
00:55:12.150 --> 00:55:12.160 align:start position:0%
the commission they authorize and sets
 
00:55:12.789 --> 00:55:12.799 align:start position:0%
the max
 
00:55:17.190 --> 00:55:17.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:20.789 --> 00:55:20.799 align:start position:0%
representative brandon yeah we
 
00:55:24.309 --> 00:55:24.319 align:start position:0%
we received a document from
 
00:55:24.319 --> 00:55:29.430 align:start position:0%
we received a document from
um

00:55:29.430 --> 00:55:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:32.069 --> 00:55:32.079 align:start position:0%
oh jeez i'm losing his name um rick
 
00:55:32.079 --> 00:55:32.789 align:start position:0%
oh jeez i'm losing his name um rick
newman

00:55:32.789 --> 00:55:32.799 align:start position:0%
newman
 
00:55:35.430 --> 00:55:35.440 align:start position:0%
thank you rick newman uh i'm just trying
 
00:55:36.549 --> 00:55:36.559 align:start position:0%
to check here
 
00:55:38.390 --> 00:55:38.400 align:start position:0%
he's suggesting to combine a couple of
 
00:55:39.750 --> 00:55:39.760 align:start position:0%
these bills
 
00:55:41.430 --> 00:55:41.440 align:start position:0%
i don't know if 25 was one of them or
 
00:55:44.150 --> 00:55:44.160 align:start position:0%
not um
 
00:55:48.630 --> 00:55:48.640 align:start position:0%
yeah it is it is yeah um
 
00:55:51.589 --> 00:55:51.599 align:start position:0%
so there's i mean this bill has three
 
00:55:53.430 --> 00:55:53.440 align:start position:0%
this bill has three components
 
00:55:55.270 --> 00:55:55.280 align:start position:0%
one is to do away with the piece of
 
00:55:57.670 --> 00:55:57.680 align:start position:0%
paper that comes out the bottom
 
00:56:00.230 --> 00:56:00.240 align:start position:0%
of the machine increase the deal size to
 
00:56:02.870 --> 00:56:02.880 align:start position:0%
14 000 tickets
 
00:56:05.430 --> 00:56:05.440 align:start position:0%
and basically to add the 25 cent ticket
 
00:56:07.030 --> 00:56:07.040 align:start position:0%
back into the
 
00:56:10.069 --> 00:56:10.079 align:start position:0%
grouping which would make mary happy
 
00:56:13.109 --> 00:56:13.119 align:start position:0%
um so there's you know
 
00:56:17.030 --> 00:56:17.040 align:start position:0%
i hate these bills but uh
 
00:56:22.150 --> 00:56:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:24.069 --> 00:56:24.079 align:start position:0%
yes the paper coming out the bottom yes
 
00:56:26.789 --> 00:56:26.799 align:start position:0%
it's a waste of paper no one looks at it
 
00:56:29.670 --> 00:56:29.680 align:start position:0%
uh but i don't know if if getting rid of
 
00:56:31.030 --> 00:56:31.040 align:start position:0%
that is
 
00:56:34.390 --> 00:56:34.400 align:start position:0%
um i mean that
 
00:56:37.349 --> 00:56:37.359 align:start position:0%
these these machines were agreed to
 
00:56:38.870 --> 00:56:38.880 align:start position:0%
because of that piece of paper
 
00:56:42.829 --> 00:56:42.839 align:start position:0%
is all i recall from way back when
 
00:56:46.309 --> 00:56:46.319 align:start position:0%
um and then the deal size
 
00:56:48.789 --> 00:56:48.799 align:start position:0%
i mean i understand the logic uh there's
 
00:56:50.950 --> 00:56:50.960 align:start position:0%
more potential winners
 
00:56:52.950 --> 00:56:52.960 align:start position:0%
um i don't really have a feeling either
 
00:56:54.390 --> 00:56:54.400 align:start position:0%
way on it um
 
00:56:55.910 --> 00:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
other than it's already happening and
 
00:56:57.829 --> 00:56:57.839 align:start position:0%
that they come at least for the machines
 
00:56:57.839 --> 00:56:59.109 align:start position:0%
that they come at least for the machines
they're

00:56:59.109 --> 00:56:59.119 align:start position:0%
they're
 
00:57:03.030 --> 00:57:03.040 align:start position:0%
they're already combining uh deals
 
00:57:05.190 --> 00:57:05.200 align:start position:0%
up to three deals to equal the 14 000
 
00:57:07.670 --> 00:57:07.680 align:start position:0%
tickets in the machines
 
00:57:10.309 --> 00:57:10.319 align:start position:0%
and then i would support the section
 
00:57:10.319 --> 00:57:11.030 align:start position:0%
and then i would support the section
three

00:57:11.030 --> 00:57:11.040 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:57:15.349 --> 00:57:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:17.750 --> 00:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
so i don't know i know this is my
 
00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:21.349 align:start position:0%
so i don't know i know this is my
comments

00:57:21.349 --> 00:57:21.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:21.359 --> 00:57:24.630 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:57:24.630 --> 00:57:24.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:28.870 --> 00:57:28.880 align:start position:0%
thank you first on i think we received
 
00:57:32.630 --> 00:57:32.640 align:start position:0%
this magnum opus from rick newman
 
00:57:35.750 --> 00:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
late last night i haven't had a chance
 
00:57:35.760 --> 00:57:36.150 align:start position:0%
late last night i haven't had a chance
to

00:57:36.150 --> 00:57:36.160 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:57:39.430 --> 00:57:39.440 align:start position:0%
read through it yet i think i
 
00:57:42.710 --> 00:57:42.720 align:start position:0%
understand what he's doing but what they
 
00:57:43.910 --> 00:57:43.920 align:start position:0%
are trying to do
 
00:57:46.470 --> 00:57:46.480 align:start position:0%
and mary is very opposed to this by the
 
00:57:46.480 --> 00:57:47.030 align:start position:0%
and mary is very opposed to this by the
way

00:57:47.030 --> 00:57:47.040 align:start position:0%
way
 
00:57:50.549 --> 00:57:50.559 align:start position:0%
um she i don't think was told we're
 
00:57:51.990 --> 00:57:52.000 align:start position:0%
doing senate bills
 
00:57:54.789 --> 00:57:54.799 align:start position:0%
today and she has to pay long distance
 
00:57:57.030 --> 00:57:57.040 align:start position:0%
charges to participate
 
00:57:59.270 --> 00:57:59.280 align:start position:0%
uh which makes it pretty difficult for
 
00:57:59.280 --> 00:58:01.109 align:start position:0%
uh which makes it pretty difficult for
her

00:58:01.109 --> 00:58:01.119 align:start position:0%
her
 
00:58:05.349 --> 00:58:05.359 align:start position:0%
but on the what they are doing
 
00:58:08.789 --> 00:58:08.799 align:start position:0%
is is finalizing turning
 
00:58:11.750 --> 00:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
these dispenser machines which is all we
 
00:58:11.760 --> 00:58:12.630 align:start position:0%
these dispenser machines which is all we
approved

00:58:12.630 --> 00:58:12.640 align:start position:0%
approved
 
00:58:14.710 --> 00:58:14.720 align:start position:0%
originally and the reason for the paper
 
00:58:17.190 --> 00:58:17.200 align:start position:0%
ticket and the reason that you would not
 
00:58:19.109 --> 00:58:19.119 align:start position:0%
be combining deals across
 
00:58:22.150 --> 00:58:22.160 align:start position:0%
machines into a
 
00:58:26.309 --> 00:58:26.319 align:start position:0%
uh essentially pretty slow
 
00:58:30.630 --> 00:58:30.640 align:start position:0%
on but slot machine type of machine
 
00:58:34.870 --> 00:58:34.880 align:start position:0%
on a playing machine in which you play
 
00:58:38.630 --> 00:58:38.640 align:start position:0%
on to on
 
00:58:42.950 --> 00:58:42.960 align:start position:0%
to on win
 
00:58:45.430 --> 00:58:45.440 align:start position:0%
under the na win randomly under the name
 
00:58:48.069 --> 00:58:48.079 align:start position:0%
of lucky seven tickets
 
00:58:51.589 --> 00:58:51.599 align:start position:0%
and as i understand they they did
 
00:58:54.630 --> 00:58:54.640 align:start position:0%
admit this and the lottery
 
00:58:56.789 --> 00:58:56.799 align:start position:0%
director admitted that that's what they
 
00:58:58.069 --> 00:58:58.079 align:start position:0%
were doing
 
00:59:01.190 --> 00:59:01.200 align:start position:0%
on and that they need to do this in
 
00:59:02.630 --> 00:59:02.640 align:start position:0%
order to be able to tell the
 
00:59:04.470 --> 00:59:04.480 align:start position:0%
massachusetts people that are coming
 
00:59:06.069 --> 00:59:06.079 align:start position:0%
across the border
 
00:59:10.630 --> 00:59:10.640 align:start position:0%
that on yes we've got slot machines too
 
00:59:13.670 --> 00:59:13.680 align:start position:0%
so so that more of them would come
 
00:59:17.670 --> 00:59:17.680 align:start position:0%
on which may make
 
00:59:20.789 --> 00:59:20.799 align:start position:0%
perfect sense to to them and the
 
00:59:22.069 --> 00:59:22.079 align:start position:0%
question is whether
 
00:59:25.589 --> 00:59:25.599 align:start position:0%
this is a policy that
 
00:59:27.349 --> 00:59:27.359 align:start position:0%
we want to engage in but the second
 
00:59:28.710 --> 00:59:28.720 align:start position:0%
question is
 
00:59:32.150 --> 00:59:32.160 align:start position:0%
we just got this amendment and i don't
 
00:59:34.150 --> 00:59:34.160 align:start position:0%
think that we really ought to finish
 
00:59:35.990 --> 00:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
discussing this
 
00:59:38.230 --> 00:59:38.240 align:start position:0%
and vote on it tomorrow unless we're
 
00:59:40.150 --> 00:59:40.160 align:start position:0%
going to vote retained tomorrow
 
00:59:44.230 --> 00:59:44.240 align:start position:0%
thank you right
 
00:59:47.270 --> 00:59:47.280 align:start position:0%
and we're just senate bill we have a lot
 
00:59:49.349 --> 00:59:49.359 align:start position:0%
of time
 
00:59:51.510 --> 00:59:51.520 align:start position:0%
what i want to do is those senate bills
 
00:59:52.470 --> 00:59:52.480 align:start position:0%
that look
 
00:59:55.829 --> 00:59:55.839 align:start position:0%
clean and that we can dispose of
 
00:59:59.030 --> 00:59:59.040 align:start position:0%
right away fine and then we have
 
01:00:03.349 --> 01:00:03.359 align:start position:0%
a smaller number of bills to work on
 
01:00:07.270 --> 01:00:07.280 align:start position:0%
so mr chairman i think this
 
01:00:10.470 --> 01:00:10.480 align:start position:0%
this um relate this comment
 
01:00:13.349 --> 01:00:13.359 align:start position:0%
and your comment relate to four of these
 
01:00:13.359 --> 01:00:16.390 align:start position:0%
and your comment relate to four of these
bills

01:00:16.390 --> 01:00:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:21.109 --> 01:00:21.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:26.069 --> 01:00:26.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:29.750 --> 01:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
yeah um
 
01:00:30.950 --> 01:00:30.960 align:start position:0%
i think it's good that we've got a
 
01:00:32.789 --> 01:00:32.799 align:start position:0%
little extra time because that means we
 
01:00:33.750 --> 01:00:33.760 align:start position:0%
can make a
 
01:00:36.230 --> 01:00:36.240 align:start position:0%
make some judgment uh without
 
01:00:38.309 --> 01:00:38.319 align:start position:0%
necessarily retaining and making
 
01:00:41.510 --> 01:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
perhaps adopting an amendment i think
 
01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:44.069 align:start position:0%
perhaps adopting an amendment i think
that

01:00:44.069 --> 01:00:44.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:47.589 --> 01:00:47.599 align:start position:0%
on one one level rick newman
 
01:00:50.069 --> 01:00:50.079 align:start position:0%
is absolutely right that these bills
 
01:00:51.829 --> 01:00:51.839 align:start position:0%
need to be combined
 
01:00:54.870 --> 01:00:54.880 align:start position:0%
they overlap they repeat uh you know
 
01:00:57.589 --> 01:00:57.599 align:start position:0%
that uh the only sensible way to proceed
 
01:00:57.599 --> 01:00:58.870 align:start position:0%
that uh the only sensible way to proceed
is

01:00:58.870 --> 01:00:58.880 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:01:01.990 --> 01:01:02.000 align:start position:0%
to combine but um once you do that you
 
01:01:02.950 --> 01:01:02.960 align:start position:0%
get into
 
01:01:06.950 --> 01:01:06.960 align:start position:0%
uh and perhaps perhaps that
 
01:01:08.789 --> 01:01:08.799 align:start position:0%
it's better not to combine for this
 
01:01:10.069 --> 01:01:10.079 align:start position:0%
reason that
 
01:01:11.510 --> 01:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
when you combine then you get the
 
01:01:14.589 --> 01:01:14.599 align:start position:0%
controversial pieces in with the
 
01:01:17.910 --> 01:01:17.920 align:start position:0%
non-controversial adjustments like
 
01:01:20.710 --> 01:01:20.720 align:start position:0%
probably whether a member of the charity
 
01:01:21.589 --> 01:01:21.599 align:start position:0%
needs to be
 
01:01:25.430 --> 01:01:25.440 align:start position:0%
present that kind of thing um
 
01:01:28.789 --> 01:01:28.799 align:start position:0%
so i i think taking taking more time we
 
01:01:30.549 --> 01:01:30.559 align:start position:0%
really need more time to
 
01:01:32.549 --> 01:01:32.559 align:start position:0%
have this amendment in front of us and
 
01:01:33.990 --> 01:01:34.000 align:start position:0%
sort through it
 
01:01:36.870 --> 01:01:36.880 align:start position:0%
decide whether maybe one of the single
 
01:01:38.069 --> 01:01:38.079 align:start position:0%
bills should be put
 
01:01:40.950 --> 01:01:40.960 align:start position:0%
forward that uh changes something that
 
01:01:43.030 --> 01:01:43.040 align:start position:0%
we all agree on and just let it go
 
01:01:47.270 --> 01:01:47.280 align:start position:0%
and then um you know discuss the paper
 
01:01:52.150 --> 01:01:52.160 align:start position:0%
um issue and uh so forth but uh
 
01:01:53.910 --> 01:01:53.920 align:start position:0%
but we need we need more time and we
 
01:01:56.549 --> 01:01:56.559 align:start position:0%
just got this i i did look it through i
 
01:02:00.390 --> 01:02:00.400 align:start position:0%
i understand everything yes 22
 
01:02:04.230 --> 01:02:04.240 align:start position:0%
and 25 we need to work on
 
01:02:07.349 --> 01:02:07.359 align:start position:0%
both of those
 
01:02:16.150 --> 01:02:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:20.069 --> 01:02:20.079 align:start position:0%
possibly 23 that one is is um
 
01:02:22.549 --> 01:02:22.559 align:start position:0%
just changing i think it's just changing
 
01:02:25.029 --> 01:02:25.039 align:start position:0%
when whether the person has to be there
 
01:02:27.029 --> 01:02:27.039 align:start position:0%
right so that that could be separated
 
01:02:29.349 --> 01:02:29.359 align:start position:0%
out but you know whatever
 
01:02:33.630 --> 01:02:33.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:33.640 --> 01:02:47.670 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:02:47.670 --> 01:02:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:50.950 --> 01:02:50.960 align:start position:0%
uh mr chair uh 27 i think is the one
 
01:02:52.390 --> 01:02:52.400 align:start position:0%
that needs
 
01:02:55.430 --> 01:02:55.440 align:start position:0%
some work because of the irs codes we
 
01:02:57.430 --> 01:02:57.440 align:start position:0%
were going to investigate
 
01:03:00.549 --> 01:03:00.559 align:start position:0%
uh yeah sounds like uh we want to make
 
01:03:01.510 --> 01:03:01.520 align:start position:0%
sure that
 
01:03:05.029 --> 01:03:05.039 align:start position:0%
that um we're capturing the
 
01:03:07.430 --> 01:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
the codes that include the charities
 
01:03:09.109 --> 01:03:09.119 align:start position:0%
that want to participate
 
01:03:12.710 --> 01:03:12.720 align:start position:0%
in in uh terrible gaming um
 
01:03:18.150 --> 01:03:18.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:22.549 --> 01:03:22.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:24.549 --> 01:03:24.559 align:start position:0%
and that we're going to hold because it
 
01:03:25.910 --> 01:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
needs more work
 
01:03:30.710 --> 01:03:30.720 align:start position:0%
is that correct right maybe 23.
 
01:03:34.069 --> 01:03:34.079 align:start position:0%
let's talk about 23 right now okay
 
01:03:37.349 --> 01:03:37.359 align:start position:0%
23 uh that says just
 
01:03:39.589 --> 01:03:39.599 align:start position:0%
changing the requirement that a member
 
01:03:41.029 --> 01:03:41.039 align:start position:0%
of the sponsoring charitable
 
01:03:42.470 --> 01:03:42.480 align:start position:0%
organization be present
 
01:03:55.430 --> 01:03:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:58.309 --> 01:03:58.319 align:start position:0%
represent southwest oh thank you mr
 
01:03:58.319 --> 01:03:58.950 align:start position:0%
represent southwest oh thank you mr
chairman

01:03:58.950 --> 01:03:58.960 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:04:01.190 --> 01:04:01.200 align:start position:0%
i think this is one we could exec it
 
01:04:03.190 --> 01:04:03.200 align:start position:0%
seems to just make common sense
 
01:04:07.270 --> 01:04:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:24.870 --> 01:04:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:27.270 --> 01:04:27.280 align:start position:0%
thank you uh could i ask the people who
 
01:04:28.069 --> 01:04:28.079 align:start position:0%
had time
 
01:04:31.270 --> 01:04:31.280 align:start position:0%
to read nick rick newman's i thought i
 
01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:32.150 align:start position:0%
to read nick rick newman's i thought i
saw

01:04:32.150 --> 01:04:32.160 align:start position:0%
saw
 
01:04:35.190 --> 01:04:35.200 align:start position:0%
material in there with which was
 
01:04:37.750 --> 01:04:37.760 align:start position:0%
cleaning up some of the language that
 
01:04:38.789 --> 01:04:38.799 align:start position:0%
follows this
 
01:04:41.430 --> 01:04:41.440 align:start position:0%
that assigns responsibilities to the
 
01:04:46.789 --> 01:04:46.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:49.670 --> 01:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
that they delegate back but i'm not sure
 
01:04:51.990 --> 01:04:52.000 align:start position:0%
because i remember being told that
 
01:04:54.150 --> 01:04:54.160 align:start position:0%
the delegation was somewhere in that
 
01:04:55.750 --> 01:04:55.760 align:start position:0%
other language
 
01:05:01.349 --> 01:05:01.359 align:start position:0%
already i didn't have time to read
 
01:05:04.630 --> 01:05:04.640 align:start position:0%
rick newman's piece senate bill 23 it's
 
01:05:06.829 --> 01:05:06.839 align:start position:0%
a very simple
 
01:05:06.839 --> 01:05:11.430 align:start position:0%
a very simple
issue

01:05:11.430 --> 01:05:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:13.990 --> 01:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
do we feel we can dispose of this
 
01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:17.910 align:start position:0%
do we feel we can dispose of this
tomorrow

01:05:17.910 --> 01:05:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:21.029 --> 01:05:21.039 align:start position:0%
the recommendation is yes so we will
 
01:05:22.549 --> 01:05:22.559 align:start position:0%
discuss senate bill
 
01:05:26.630 --> 01:05:26.640 align:start position:0%
23 tomorrow that's the first one
 
01:05:31.109 --> 01:05:31.119 align:start position:0%
out of six senate bill 48
 
01:05:32.950 --> 01:05:32.960 align:start position:0%
relative to the formula used to
 
01:05:36.230 --> 01:05:36.240 align:start position:0%
determine current use tax rates
 
01:05:39.349 --> 01:05:39.359 align:start position:0%
and what this one does is
 
01:05:45.750 --> 01:05:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:52.470 --> 01:05:52.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:55.589 --> 01:05:55.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:00.630 --> 01:06:00.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:03.750 --> 01:06:03.760 align:start position:0%
comment and representative broadly yes i
 
01:06:04.950 --> 01:06:04.960 align:start position:0%
think this is ready to go
 
01:06:08.630 --> 01:06:08.640 align:start position:0%
tomorrow and uh
 
01:06:10.390 --> 01:06:10.400 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that the dra has no
 
01:06:11.829 --> 01:06:11.839 align:start position:0%
problem with this uh
 
01:06:15.349 --> 01:06:15.359 align:start position:0%
with this bill they feel that
 
01:06:18.309 --> 01:06:18.319 align:start position:0%
uh it it will not violate any of their
 
01:06:19.190 --> 01:06:19.200 align:start position:0%
roles if we
 
01:06:22.789 --> 01:06:22.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:28.309 --> 01:06:28.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:30.829 --> 01:06:30.839 align:start position:0%
okay then we will deal with that one
 
01:06:30.839 --> 01:06:37.750 align:start position:0%
okay then we will deal with that one
tomorrow

01:06:37.750 --> 01:06:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:50.950 --> 01:06:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:52.950 --> 01:06:52.960 align:start position:0%
relative to the nexus provision for
 
01:06:55.270 --> 01:06:55.280 align:start position:0%
certain disaster related or emergency
 
01:06:56.390 --> 01:06:56.400 align:start position:0%
related work
 
01:07:00.069 --> 01:07:00.079 align:start position:0%
performed in the state and this is an
 
01:07:02.870 --> 01:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
important bill put in by senator
 
01:07:02.880 --> 01:07:05.750 align:start position:0%
important bill put in by senator
brackley

01:07:05.750 --> 01:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:05.760 --> 01:07:11.109 align:start position:0%
 
comments

01:07:11.109 --> 01:07:11.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:14.630 --> 01:07:14.640 align:start position:0%
represent southwest again to me this is
 
01:07:15.430 --> 01:07:15.440 align:start position:0%
in the uh
 
01:07:18.230 --> 01:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
practical common sense category and i
 
01:07:20.230 --> 01:07:20.240 align:start position:0%
didn't see any problems with it so
 
01:07:28.150 --> 01:07:28.160 align:start position:0%
i think we could pass it
 
01:07:31.270 --> 01:07:31.280 align:start position:0%
uh representative romney yeah
 
01:07:33.349 --> 01:07:33.359 align:start position:0%
and talking to the dra a little further
 
01:07:35.589 --> 01:07:35.599 align:start position:0%
about this um
 
01:07:37.589 --> 01:07:37.599 align:start position:0%
i think they may be they'd like to
 
01:07:39.910 --> 01:07:39.920 align:start position:0%
suggest an amendment to this
 
01:07:42.549 --> 01:07:42.559 align:start position:0%
uh so can we hold on this tomorrow and
 
01:07:47.510 --> 01:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:54.390 --> 01:07:54.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:58.950 --> 01:07:58.960 align:start position:0%
then we're gonna hold on this for the
 
01:08:02.069 --> 01:08:02.079 align:start position:0%
work session and take a look at
 
01:08:06.150 --> 01:08:06.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:10.390 --> 01:08:10.400 align:start position:0%
with the dra so from that group
 
01:08:14.630 --> 01:08:14.640 align:start position:0%
mr chairman yes when we get the dra back
 
01:08:18.789 --> 01:08:18.799 align:start position:0%
could we also get the on
 
01:08:23.510 --> 01:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
the uh either i suppose owen smith from
 
01:08:26.789 --> 01:08:26.799 align:start position:0%
a t and t are one of the people that
 
01:08:29.990 --> 01:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
need this so that they could talk
 
01:08:32.870 --> 01:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
with us about whether this would make it
 
01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:33.189 align:start position:0%
with us about whether this would make it
uh

01:08:33.189 --> 01:08:33.199 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:08:34.630 --> 01:08:34.640 align:start position:0%
apparently they're trying to pass
 
01:08:37.030 --> 01:08:37.040 align:start position:0%
exactly the same bill everywhere so that
 
01:08:38.630 --> 01:08:38.640 align:start position:0%
they won't run into
 
01:08:42.070 --> 01:08:42.080 align:start position:0%
to on longer periods before they can get
 
01:08:42.950 --> 01:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
stuff done
 
01:08:45.430 --> 01:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
in an emergency yeah i think what i've
 
01:08:47.430 --> 01:08:47.440 align:start position:0%
read as far as says
 
01:08:50.829 --> 01:08:50.839 align:start position:0%
they've passed this in 33 states i
 
01:08:50.839 --> 01:08:53.269 align:start position:0%
they've passed this in 33 states i
believe

01:08:53.269 --> 01:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
believe
 
01:08:56.950 --> 01:08:56.960 align:start position:0%
but to me my observation
 
01:09:00.229 --> 01:09:00.239 align:start position:0%
makes good sense
 
01:09:03.110 --> 01:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
all right so we will wait until we
 
01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:04.149 align:start position:0%
all right so we will wait until we
discuss

01:09:04.149 --> 01:09:04.159 align:start position:0%
discuss
 
01:09:09.669 --> 01:09:09.679 align:start position:0%
with the dra a possible amendment
 
01:09:12.950 --> 01:09:12.960 align:start position:0%
so out of this group of six pills mr
 
01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:14.149 align:start position:0%
so out of this group of six pills mr
chair

01:09:14.149 --> 01:09:14.159 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:09:17.510 --> 01:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
um uh representative uh twitter tutors
 
01:09:18.470 --> 01:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
had his hand up
 
01:09:22.229 --> 01:09:22.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:24.229 --> 01:09:24.239 align:start position:0%
yes mr chairs is kind of a rookie
 
01:09:26.070 --> 01:09:26.080 align:start position:0%
question senate bill 25
 
01:09:28.390 --> 01:09:28.400 align:start position:0%
as written is very clean and probably
 
01:09:30.229 --> 01:09:30.239 align:start position:0%
could be pushed through tomorrow
 
01:09:32.070 --> 01:09:32.080 align:start position:0%
i didn't know if the amendment against
 
01:09:33.749 --> 01:09:33.759 align:start position:0%
it could be changed to one of the other
 
01:09:35.349 --> 01:09:35.359 align:start position:0%
bills that needs work
 
01:09:44.630 --> 01:09:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:48.470 --> 01:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
comments on representative tudors
 
01:09:51.829 --> 01:09:51.839 align:start position:0%
comments on 25.
 
01:09:56.149 --> 01:09:56.159 align:start position:0%
mr chairman 25 is repeated
 
01:09:58.550 --> 01:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
in another bill that was part of the
 
01:09:58.560 --> 01:10:00.550 align:start position:0%
in another bill that was part of the
problem

01:10:00.550 --> 01:10:00.560 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:10:02.470 --> 01:10:02.480 align:start position:0%
that they passed this one and then they
 
01:10:09.430 --> 01:10:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:13.350 --> 01:10:13.360 align:start position:0%
but if we passed 25 as a standalone
 
01:10:15.189 --> 01:10:15.199 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't need that in the other
 
01:10:15.199 --> 01:10:16.550 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't need that in the other
bill

01:10:16.550 --> 01:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:10:26.390 --> 01:10:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:30.310 --> 01:10:30.320 align:start position:0%
yeah back to 25. uh
 
01:10:33.510 --> 01:10:33.520 align:start position:0%
no i'm not no i'm i'm
 
01:10:38.630 --> 01:10:38.640 align:start position:0%
back one bill back to senate bill 103.
 
01:10:41.590 --> 01:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
hold on a minute i want to get 25 okay
 
01:10:42.470 --> 01:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
my hand was up
 
01:10:44.709 --> 01:10:44.719 align:start position:0%
since then that's all so i'll i'll i'll
 
01:10:44.719 --> 01:10:46.470 align:start position:0%
since then that's all so i'll i'll i'll
wait

01:10:46.470 --> 01:10:46.480 align:start position:0%
wait
 
01:10:50.390 --> 01:10:50.400 align:start position:0%
representative tudor made his comment
 
01:10:53.110 --> 01:10:53.120 align:start position:0%
of why we should handle 25 tomorrow i'd
 
01:10:53.990 --> 01:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
like to
 
01:10:57.990 --> 01:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
clear the depth of this one
 
01:11:00.070 --> 01:11:00.080 align:start position:0%
so if you've got a comment on 25
 
01:11:00.080 --> 01:11:02.149 align:start position:0%
so if you've got a comment on 25
representatives

01:11:02.149 --> 01:11:02.159 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
01:11:05.270 --> 01:11:05.280 align:start position:0%
yeah i i have no problem um
 
01:11:08.149 --> 01:11:08.159 align:start position:0%
going forward with that it's it's common
 
01:11:08.159 --> 01:11:10.149 align:start position:0%
going forward with that it's it's common
sense

01:11:10.149 --> 01:11:10.159 align:start position:0%
sense
 
01:11:13.830 --> 01:11:13.840 align:start position:0%
um and uh
 
01:11:15.350 --> 01:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
i mean common sense says that we should
 
01:11:17.189 --> 01:11:17.199 align:start position:0%
combine these bills but but
 
01:11:19.189 --> 01:11:19.199 align:start position:0%
uh it's easy to go forward with these
 
01:11:20.950 --> 01:11:20.960 align:start position:0%
individual bills and i have no problem
 
01:11:22.870 --> 01:11:22.880 align:start position:0%
going forward with this
 
01:11:25.830 --> 01:11:25.840 align:start position:0%
and then we'll deal with uh the more
 
01:11:28.390 --> 01:11:28.400 align:start position:0%
comprehensive bills that
 
01:11:30.229 --> 01:11:30.239 align:start position:0%
that we'd be holding and looking more
 
01:11:31.590 --> 01:11:31.600 align:start position:0%
closely at and take
 
01:11:34.229 --> 01:11:34.239 align:start position:0%
this provision out of that if we've gone
 
01:11:36.310 --> 01:11:36.320 align:start position:0%
forward with it already
 
01:11:43.350 --> 01:11:43.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:46.390 --> 01:11:46.400 align:start position:0%
senator bromley yeah i concur right
 
01:11:48.149 --> 01:11:48.159 align:start position:0%
i think we can move forward the lottery
 
01:11:49.750 --> 01:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
the lottery it's my understanding the
 
01:11:51.110 --> 01:11:51.120 align:start position:0%
lottery commission would like to see
 
01:11:51.120 --> 01:11:51.910 align:start position:0%
lottery commission would like to see
this

01:11:51.910 --> 01:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:11:53.110 --> 01:11:53.120 align:start position:0%
they just make their life a little
 
01:11:55.189 --> 01:11:55.199 align:start position:0%
easier in terms of
 
01:11:59.270 --> 01:11:59.280 align:start position:0%
uh re-licensing people
 
01:12:03.750 --> 01:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:07.830 --> 01:12:07.840 align:start position:0%
tomorrow we hope to act on senate bill
 
01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:08.630 align:start position:0%
tomorrow we hope to act on senate bill
25

01:12:08.630 --> 01:12:08.640 align:start position:0%
25
 
01:12:11.910 --> 01:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
23 and 48
 
01:12:15.910 --> 01:12:15.920 align:start position:0%
and others you want to reconsider
 
01:12:18.390 --> 01:12:18.400 align:start position:0%
representative brown there no i just it
 
01:12:20.149 --> 01:12:20.159 align:start position:0%
was just a comment on
 
01:12:23.270 --> 01:12:23.280 align:start position:0%
senate bill 103.
 
01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:27.830 align:start position:0%
senate bill 103.
again

01:12:27.830 --> 01:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:31.990 --> 01:12:32.000 align:start position:0%
say again senate bill 103
 
01:12:35.590 --> 01:12:35.600 align:start position:0%
um okay so
 
01:12:38.870 --> 01:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
the the was as was mentioned this is a
 
01:12:41.110 --> 01:12:41.120 align:start position:0%
boilerplate bill
 
01:12:44.790 --> 01:12:44.800 align:start position:0%
that states are adopting okay
 
01:12:47.430 --> 01:12:47.440 align:start position:0%
and i think the dra when it looked at
 
01:12:49.430 --> 01:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
the language just for everybody
 
01:12:50.950 --> 01:12:50.960 align:start position:0%
when they looked at the language it had
 
01:12:53.669 --> 01:12:53.679 align:start position:0%
to do with attacks
 
01:12:55.030 --> 01:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
given that we're a little different than
 
01:12:57.590 --> 01:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
of the states they felt that a uh
 
01:13:00.229 --> 01:13:00.239 align:start position:0%
an amendment was needed so that's that's
 
01:13:01.750 --> 01:13:01.760 align:start position:0%
the basis of their amendment
 
01:13:04.070 --> 01:13:04.080 align:start position:0%
so we'll talk about this more i guess
 
01:13:04.950 --> 01:13:04.960 align:start position:0%
once we uh
 
01:13:12.070 --> 01:13:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:16.830 --> 01:13:16.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:26.070 --> 01:13:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:29.590 --> 01:13:29.600 align:start position:0%
and the five house bills which is 532
 
01:13:29.600 --> 01:13:30.310 align:start position:0%
and the five house bills which is 532
610

01:13:30.310 --> 01:13:30.320 align:start position:0%
610
 
01:13:34.390 --> 01:13:34.400 align:start position:0%
614 615 and 624
 
01:13:38.470 --> 01:13:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:46.149 --> 01:13:46.159 align:start position:0%
23 25 and 48.
 
01:13:51.830 --> 01:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
and then we'll schedule work sessions
 
01:13:56.550 --> 01:13:56.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:06.709 --> 01:14:06.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:13.990 --> 01:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
before i get into the revenue part
 
01:14:17.189 --> 01:14:17.199 align:start position:0%
for the for the republicans what's a
 
01:14:19.270 --> 01:14:19.280 align:start position:0%
good time to do a
 
01:14:24.550 --> 01:14:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:29.750 --> 01:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
it's two o'clock okay
 
01:14:33.030 --> 01:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
that works for me this is representative
 
01:14:35.590 --> 01:14:35.600 align:start position:0%
this is representative sooner than later
 
01:14:38.149 --> 01:14:38.159 align:start position:0%
is better for me this afternoon
 
01:14:42.630 --> 01:14:42.640 align:start position:0%
well one o'clock norm
 
01:14:45.990 --> 01:14:46.000 align:start position:0%
um so how how long are we gonna go it's
 
01:14:47.910 --> 01:14:47.920 align:start position:0%
it's only uh 10 15
 
01:14:51.270 --> 01:14:51.280 align:start position:0%
is it possible to do it like 15 minutes
 
01:14:52.790 --> 01:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
after we're done
 
01:14:54.830 --> 01:14:54.840 align:start position:0%
how much longer you think we're going to
 
01:14:56.870 --> 01:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
be uh we're not going to be
 
01:15:00.070 --> 01:15:00.080 align:start position:0%
much longer yeah we could would it be
 
01:15:00.709 --> 01:15:00.719 align:start position:0%
better for our
 
01:15:04.149 --> 01:15:04.159 align:start position:0%
members of the republican caucus to meet
 
01:15:05.669 --> 01:15:05.679 align:start position:0%
15 minutes after we're done give you
 
01:15:08.070 --> 01:15:08.080 align:start position:0%
time to get the zoom link out
 
01:15:10.470 --> 01:15:10.480 align:start position:0%
get the link out right because that's
 
01:15:13.590 --> 01:15:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:16.709 --> 01:15:16.719 align:start position:0%
for the republicans yes
 
01:15:19.750 --> 01:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
okay fine but susan do you
 
01:15:23.110 --> 01:15:23.120 align:start position:0%
want to query your talk
 
01:15:25.030 --> 01:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
i think that we wouldn't have any
 
01:15:27.350 --> 01:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
problem going straight to a caucus
 
01:15:30.790 --> 01:15:30.800 align:start position:0%
after this if um amanda
 
01:15:33.510 --> 01:15:33.520 align:start position:0%
could we use your link again of course
 
01:15:35.110 --> 01:15:35.120 align:start position:0%
and i'll send it out
 
01:15:38.229 --> 01:15:38.239 align:start position:0%
great on the but
 
01:15:40.950 --> 01:15:40.960 align:start position:0%
i have another question about whether we
 
01:15:43.590 --> 01:15:43.600 align:start position:0%
are you want us to work at all next week
 
01:15:46.149 --> 01:15:46.159 align:start position:0%
because next week is likely to be full
 
01:15:53.590 --> 01:15:53.600 align:start position:0%
of budget consultations and things
 
01:15:57.590 --> 01:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:00.229 --> 01:16:00.239 align:start position:0%
see like today i had this week i had to
 
01:16:00.239 --> 01:16:02.149 align:start position:0%
see like today i had this week i had to
put

01:16:02.149 --> 01:16:02.159 align:start position:0%
put
 
01:16:05.590 --> 01:16:05.600 align:start position:0%
i didn't know when we would get the
 
01:16:07.030 --> 01:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
information to me
 
01:16:09.750 --> 01:16:09.760 align:start position:0%
because i'm trying to get somebody that
 
01:16:10.390 --> 01:16:10.400 align:start position:0%
is an
 
01:16:13.830 --> 01:16:13.840 align:start position:0%
expertise on the stimulus package
 
01:16:17.030 --> 01:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
and jennifer's working on that and
 
01:16:19.669 --> 01:16:19.679 align:start position:0%
a few others and once that happens i
 
01:16:20.950 --> 01:16:20.960 align:start position:0%
want to bring them in
 
01:16:24.470 --> 01:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
to the committee and uh so if i
 
01:16:28.470 --> 01:16:28.480 align:start position:0%
say okay such and such a day's revenues
 
01:16:30.550 --> 01:16:30.560 align:start position:0%
then i can use that day but if i don't
 
01:16:32.149 --> 01:16:32.159 align:start position:0%
have it in the calendar i have to wait
 
01:16:33.990 --> 01:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
another way
 
01:16:37.030 --> 01:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
so for this week we should finish our
 
01:16:38.149 --> 01:16:38.159 align:start position:0%
work for this week
 
01:16:41.350 --> 01:16:41.360 align:start position:0%
tomorrow morning so we won't have to
 
01:16:43.030 --> 01:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
meet thursday
 
01:16:45.110 --> 01:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
but i had a placeholder in case we
 
01:16:46.709 --> 01:16:46.719 align:start position:0%
didn't something happened
 
01:16:49.990 --> 01:16:50.000 align:start position:0%
we needed them and i want to put a
 
01:16:54.310 --> 01:16:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:56.709 --> 01:16:56.719 align:start position:0%
yeah well representative ames and i
 
01:16:59.350 --> 01:16:59.360 align:start position:0%
probably cannot participate on tuesday
 
01:17:00.630 --> 01:17:00.640 align:start position:0%
next week
 
01:17:03.030 --> 01:17:03.040 align:start position:0%
okay i'm not sure about the rest of the
 
01:17:05.270 --> 01:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
week i can't as i told you i can't
 
01:17:08.790 --> 01:17:08.800 align:start position:0%
participate on wednesday uh getting my
 
01:17:08.800 --> 01:17:09.430 align:start position:0%
participate on wednesday uh getting my
shot

01:17:09.430 --> 01:17:09.440 align:start position:0%
shot
 
01:17:12.470 --> 01:17:12.480 align:start position:0%
my last one and i'm not sure on
 
01:17:27.430 --> 01:17:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:29.990 --> 01:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
all over the place for next week thank
 
01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:33.350 align:start position:0%
all over the place for next week thank
you

01:17:33.350 --> 01:17:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:36.950 --> 01:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
so you can't meet at all on tuesday
 
01:17:39.750 --> 01:17:39.760 align:start position:0%
on we don't know exactly when they're
 
01:17:41.350 --> 01:17:41.360 align:start position:0%
going to schedule it yet
 
01:17:45.030 --> 01:17:45.040 align:start position:0%
but on we too on
 
01:17:47.990 --> 01:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
are going to be in a ranking dems
 
01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:48.550 align:start position:0%
are going to be in a ranking dems
meeting

01:17:48.550 --> 01:17:48.560 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
01:17:57.990 --> 01:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
that is going to go a long time
 
01:18:02.709 --> 01:18:02.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:06.390 --> 01:18:06.400 align:start position:0%
uh i personally am only available to
 
01:18:09.830 --> 01:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
to 10 30 at the latest because i have to
 
01:18:14.950 --> 01:18:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:18.070 --> 01:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
okay we'll talk off offline on that but
 
01:18:21.110 --> 01:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:25.189 --> 01:18:25.199 align:start position:0%
we do have a lot of time after
 
01:18:28.310 --> 01:18:28.320 align:start position:0%
after crossover
 
01:18:30.310 --> 01:18:30.320 align:start position:0%
we've done a lot of the senate bills
 
01:18:32.310 --> 01:18:32.320 align:start position:0%
we're likely to get
 
01:18:35.830 --> 01:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
and the later we wait the more accurate
 
01:18:37.510 --> 01:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
information we're going to get about
 
01:18:39.270 --> 01:18:39.280 align:start position:0%
what the treasurer decided about the
 
01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:45.910 align:start position:0%
what the treasurer decided about the
stimulus

01:18:45.910 --> 01:18:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:49.590 --> 01:18:49.600 align:start position:0%
before the budget passes
 
01:18:53.910 --> 01:18:53.920 align:start position:0%
and sure we need to get together again
 
01:18:57.430 --> 01:18:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:01.430 --> 01:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
we have had discussions in our party
 
01:19:04.950 --> 01:19:04.960 align:start position:0%
relative to things in house bill 2.
 
01:19:07.750 --> 01:19:07.760 align:start position:0%
there are suggestions that have come up
 
01:19:08.870 --> 01:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
that are different
 
01:19:11.910 --> 01:19:11.920 align:start position:0%
than what we have agreed on
 
01:19:11.920 --> 01:19:14.950 align:start position:0%
than what we have agreed on
and

01:19:14.950 --> 01:19:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:17.590 --> 01:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
i think we need to address those as they
 
01:19:19.510 --> 01:19:19.520 align:start position:0%
come up
 
01:19:22.709 --> 01:19:22.719 align:start position:0%
and we can address them if we
 
01:19:24.550 --> 01:19:24.560 align:start position:0%
put in the calendar that we have
 
01:19:29.350 --> 01:19:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:34.470 --> 01:19:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:36.709 --> 01:19:36.719 align:start position:0%
we just on that particular issue we are
 
01:19:37.910 --> 01:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
not going to have enough
 
01:19:42.310 --> 01:19:42.320 align:start position:0%
information they're arguing it out in dc
 
01:19:43.750 --> 01:19:43.760 align:start position:0%
and they're going to be arguing for a
 
01:19:45.430 --> 01:19:45.440 align:start position:0%
while probably going to have to go
 
01:19:46.470 --> 01:19:46.480 align:start position:0%
through the courts
 
01:19:48.550 --> 01:19:48.560 align:start position:0%
on the stimulus if there's other things
 
01:19:50.149 --> 01:19:50.159 align:start position:0%
other than the stimulus that could
 
01:19:50.159 --> 01:19:50.550 align:start position:0%
other than the stimulus that could
affect

01:19:50.550 --> 01:19:50.560 align:start position:0%
affect
 
01:19:53.510 --> 01:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
revenues that people are thinking about
 
01:19:54.950 --> 01:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
and i think we need to
 
01:19:58.550 --> 01:19:58.560 align:start position:0%
have a position from this committee
 
01:20:00.870 --> 01:20:00.880 align:start position:0%
the position from this committee carries
 
01:20:02.550 --> 01:20:02.560 align:start position:0%
a lot of weight
 
01:20:05.669 --> 01:20:05.679 align:start position:0%
a position from one or two of us doesn't
 
01:20:05.679 --> 01:20:06.390 align:start position:0%
a position from one or two of us doesn't
represent

01:20:06.390 --> 01:20:06.400 align:start position:0%
represent
 
01:20:10.149 --> 01:20:10.159 align:start position:0%
a committee position and
 
01:20:13.189 --> 01:20:13.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:15.030 --> 01:20:15.040 align:start position:0%
what does the ways and means committee
 
01:20:16.550 --> 01:20:16.560 align:start position:0%
feel if we do
 
01:20:19.590 --> 01:20:19.600 align:start position:0%
this or that
 
01:20:27.270 --> 01:20:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:29.750 --> 01:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
retirement in two years rather than five
 
01:20:29.760 --> 01:20:31.750 align:start position:0%
retirement in two years rather than five
years

01:20:31.750 --> 01:20:31.760 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:20:36.229 --> 01:20:36.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:39.830 --> 01:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
anything else before a couple of
 
01:20:42.390 --> 01:20:42.400 align:start position:0%
things i want to talk about real quick
 
01:20:44.830 --> 01:20:44.840 align:start position:0%
you stand right now
 
01:20:48.310 --> 01:20:48.320 align:start position:0%
romney so uh it's
 
01:20:51.350 --> 01:20:51.360 align:start position:0%
is in our understanding that ppp
 
01:20:55.910 --> 01:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
bill was the senate bill 3 has passed
 
01:20:58.790 --> 01:20:58.800 align:start position:0%
and it's heading our way now the
 
01:21:00.470 --> 01:21:00.480 align:start position:0%
quickness of that i i
 
01:21:02.070 --> 01:21:02.080 align:start position:0%
my sense is that everybody's going to
 
01:21:04.950 --> 01:21:04.960 align:start position:0%
want a quick turn on that bill from us
 
01:21:07.270 --> 01:21:07.280 align:start position:0%
so that's the only big variable for next
 
01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:08.470 align:start position:0%
so that's the only big variable for next
week

01:21:08.470 --> 01:21:08.480 align:start position:0%
week
 
01:21:10.950 --> 01:21:10.960 align:start position:0%
and i think we can if that bill does
 
01:21:12.149 --> 01:21:12.159 align:start position:0%
come to us
 
01:21:13.510 --> 01:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
i'm sure we can work around
 
01:21:15.669 --> 01:21:15.679 align:start position:0%
representative army's schedule as well
 
01:21:15.679 --> 01:21:16.070 align:start position:0%
representative army's schedule as well
as

01:21:16.070 --> 01:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:21:18.310 --> 01:21:18.320 align:start position:0%
you know the the the ways and means
 
01:21:20.070 --> 01:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
democrat schedule
 
01:21:23.350 --> 01:21:23.360 align:start position:0%
uh to uh possibly take that up next week
 
01:21:25.590 --> 01:21:25.600 align:start position:0%
depending on your your your view of the
 
01:21:27.510 --> 01:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
sense of the urgency of uh
 
01:21:30.390 --> 01:21:30.400 align:start position:0%
that we get from leadership as to uh how
 
01:21:33.510 --> 01:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
quick of a turn they want on ppp bill
 
01:21:37.669 --> 01:21:37.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:41.990 --> 01:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
is understanding that bill
 
01:21:45.270 --> 01:21:45.280 align:start position:0%
and the ramification is important for
 
01:21:46.229 --> 01:21:46.239 align:start position:0%
all of us
 
01:21:48.629 --> 01:21:48.639 align:start position:0%
to get that understanding before the
 
01:21:52.070 --> 01:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:55.510 --> 01:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
and if that comes to us i want to be
 
01:21:56.950 --> 01:21:56.960 align:start position:0%
able to do that
 
01:22:00.070 --> 01:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
before the budget pass and all we have
 
01:22:08.830 --> 01:22:08.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:08.840 --> 01:22:10.149 align:start position:0%
 
that

01:22:10.149 --> 01:22:10.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:22:13.510 --> 01:22:13.520 align:start position:0%
yeah the week after that as we're tied
 
01:22:14.870 --> 01:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
up the whole week
 
01:22:20.390 --> 01:22:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:23.669 --> 01:22:23.679 align:start position:0%
mr chairman if we do the ppp bill next
 
01:22:23.679 --> 01:22:23.990 align:start position:0%
mr chairman if we do the ppp bill next
week

01:22:23.990 --> 01:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
week
 
01:22:30.470 --> 01:22:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:34.870 --> 01:22:34.880 align:start position:0%
find out tomorrow how soon is coming
 
01:22:39.590 --> 01:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
if i know it's coming we will be
 
01:22:43.270 --> 01:22:43.280 align:start position:0%
and i might even put a placeholder
 
01:22:48.790 --> 01:22:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:53.669 --> 01:22:53.679 align:start position:0%
and then get amendment to the calendar
 
01:22:56.550 --> 01:22:56.560 align:start position:0%
but it's it's important that we
 
01:22:58.870 --> 01:22:58.880 align:start position:0%
understand the ramification of that bill
 
01:23:06.550 --> 01:23:06.560 align:start position:0%
when we start passing the budget
 
01:23:09.750 --> 01:23:09.760 align:start position:0%
any further comments before okay if
 
01:23:12.390 --> 01:23:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:15.430 --> 01:23:15.440 align:start position:0%
i sent you an email this morning
 
01:23:22.629 --> 01:23:22.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:26.310 --> 01:23:26.320 align:start position:0%
the email has the
 
01:23:32.470 --> 01:23:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:36.229 --> 01:23:36.239 align:start position:0%
that has the revenues that our committee
 
01:23:39.990 --> 01:23:40.000 align:start position:0%
agreed to in it so
 
01:23:42.550 --> 01:23:42.560 align:start position:0%
house bill 1 goes to the floor you'll
 
01:23:45.470 --> 01:23:45.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:49.910 --> 01:23:49.920 align:start position:0%
0924 and it's
 
01:23:52.629 --> 01:23:52.639 align:start position:0%
an amendment sponsored by weiler and
 
01:23:52.639 --> 01:23:54.149 align:start position:0%
an amendment sponsored by weiler and
major

01:23:54.149 --> 01:23:54.159 align:start position:0%
major
 
01:23:57.590 --> 01:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
and it has our revenues as we
 
01:24:02.870 --> 01:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
proposed exactly
 
01:24:05.350 --> 01:24:05.360 align:start position:0%
also this morning i sent you a revenue
 
01:24:05.360 --> 01:24:06.310 align:start position:0%
also this morning i sent you a revenue
comparison

01:24:06.310 --> 01:24:06.320 align:start position:0%
comparison
 
01:24:11.430 --> 01:24:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:14.149 --> 01:24:14.159 align:start position:0%
in that revenue comparison sheet the
 
01:24:16.070 --> 01:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
whole idea of that
 
01:24:18.470 --> 01:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
is to take these revenues that we had
 
01:24:18.480 --> 01:24:21.270 align:start position:0%
is to take these revenues that we had
passed

01:24:21.270 --> 01:24:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:24.709 --> 01:24:24.719 align:start position:0%
along the house bill two changes that we
 
01:24:26.870 --> 01:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
had agreed on
 
01:24:29.350 --> 01:24:29.360 align:start position:0%
and compare those revenues to what the
 
01:24:31.830 --> 01:24:31.840 align:start position:0%
governor proposed
 
01:24:36.149 --> 01:24:36.159 align:start position:0%
so i hope that
 
01:24:39.189 --> 01:24:39.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:43.110 --> 01:24:43.120 align:start position:0%
that sheet on that sheet
 
01:24:46.390 --> 01:24:46.400 align:start position:0%
it has the house ways and means revenue
 
01:24:51.430 --> 01:24:51.440 align:start position:0%
under current law for 22 and 23
 
01:24:58.310 --> 01:24:58.320 align:start position:0%
which is the 2764 and the 2805
 
01:25:02.070 --> 01:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
and then the house bill 2 changes
 
01:25:07.430 --> 01:25:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:10.950 --> 01:25:10.960 align:start position:0%
which reduces the revenue 22 by 10.6
 
01:25:13.669 --> 01:25:13.679 align:start position:0%
million so we have a number of pluses
 
01:25:15.750 --> 01:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
and a number of minuses
 
01:25:18.950 --> 01:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
the minuses were the bet tax credits and
 
01:25:20.310 --> 01:25:20.320 align:start position:0%
things like that
 
01:25:24.830 --> 01:25:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:26.950 --> 01:25:26.960 align:start position:0%
revenues so that
 
01:25:30.310 --> 01:25:30.320 align:start position:0%
the again the hospital
 
01:25:32.950 --> 01:25:32.960 align:start position:0%
two changes were minus ten point six
 
01:25:32.960 --> 01:25:33.430 align:start position:0%
two changes were minus ten point six
million

01:25:33.430 --> 01:25:33.440 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:25:35.510 --> 01:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
and minus six point four in the second
 
01:25:35.520 --> 01:25:37.510 align:start position:0%
and minus six point four in the second
year

01:25:37.510 --> 01:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:25:39.830 --> 01:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
the house weighs in means total come up
 
01:25:42.110 --> 01:25:42.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:44.950 --> 01:25:44.960 align:start position:0%
2.7534 billion dollars
 
01:25:50.310 --> 01:25:50.320 align:start position:0%
and 22 and 2.7941 billion and 23.
 
01:25:53.590 --> 01:25:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:56.950 --> 01:25:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:01.270 --> 01:26:01.280 align:start position:0%
they started off with 2748
 
01:26:07.270 --> 01:26:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:09.750 --> 01:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
and house built two changes in the first
 
01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:10.629 align:start position:0%
and house built two changes in the first
year

01:26:10.629 --> 01:26:10.639 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:26:14.070 --> 01:26:14.080 align:start position:0%
reduced his revenues 46.5 million
 
01:26:14.080 --> 01:26:15.430 align:start position:0%
reduced his revenues 46.5 million
dollars

01:26:15.430 --> 01:26:15.440 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:26:19.430 --> 01:26:19.440 align:start position:0%
in the second year 81.6
 
01:26:22.470 --> 01:26:22.480 align:start position:0%
and the biggest part of those is due to
 
01:26:22.480 --> 01:26:22.870 align:start position:0%
and the biggest part of those is due to
the

01:26:22.870 --> 01:26:22.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:26:27.030 --> 01:26:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:29.030 --> 01:26:29.040 align:start position:0%
and so therefore the governor's totals
 
01:26:31.110 --> 01:26:31.120 align:start position:0%
was 2701 and 27
 
01:26:34.870 --> 01:26:34.880 align:start position:0%
18. the house was
 
01:26:37.750 --> 01:26:37.760 align:start position:0%
51 51.9 million dollars ahead of the
 
01:26:40.390 --> 01:26:40.400 align:start position:0%
governor in 22
 
01:26:44.070 --> 01:26:44.080 align:start position:0%
and 75.8 ahead of the governor
 
01:26:48.229 --> 01:26:48.239 align:start position:0%
and 23. the reason why
 
01:26:51.510 --> 01:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
we don't have as much
 
01:26:55.110 --> 01:26:55.120 align:start position:0%
of a decrease household two
 
01:27:00.310 --> 01:27:00.320 align:start position:0%
as we put a house bill to a memonine
 
01:27:03.030 --> 01:27:03.040 align:start position:0%
which they agreed on that house bill two
 
01:27:03.040 --> 01:27:04.550 align:start position:0%
which they agreed on that house bill two
amendment

01:27:04.550 --> 01:27:04.560 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:27:07.030 --> 01:27:07.040 align:start position:0%
changes the credit carry over and you
 
01:27:09.830 --> 01:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
have that information
 
01:27:13.110 --> 01:27:13.120 align:start position:0%
so it's done using
 
01:27:16.310 --> 01:27:16.320 align:start position:0%
the 500 percent
 
01:27:20.229 --> 01:27:20.239 align:start position:0%
200 percent and 100 spread out
 
01:27:23.669 --> 01:27:23.679 align:start position:0%
so the effect in the first year was only
 
01:27:25.510 --> 01:27:25.520 align:start position:0%
four million dollars
 
01:27:28.390 --> 01:27:28.400 align:start position:0%
in the second year 11 million dollars if
 
01:27:28.950 --> 01:27:28.960 align:start position:0%
we took
 
01:27:32.390 --> 01:27:32.400 align:start position:0%
about seven eighty percent the first
 
01:27:37.350 --> 01:27:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:40.709 --> 01:27:40.719 align:start position:0%
and that is what's going into house bill
 
01:27:40.719 --> 01:27:41.110 align:start position:0%
and that is what's going into house bill
two

01:27:41.110 --> 01:27:41.120 align:start position:0%
two
 
01:27:44.629 --> 01:27:44.639 align:start position:0%
as part of the budget i just wanted to
 
01:27:48.629 --> 01:27:48.639 align:start position:0%
make sure to bring this up to you
 
01:27:54.390 --> 01:27:54.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:57.270 --> 01:27:57.280 align:start position:0%
question floating out there how about if
 
01:28:00.070 --> 01:28:00.080 align:start position:0%
we change the
 
01:28:04.070 --> 01:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
house the interest and dividend
 
01:28:06.950 --> 01:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
roll back for two years rather than the
 
01:28:12.830 --> 01:28:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:12.840 --> 01:28:19.669 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:28:19.669 --> 01:28:19.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:27.890 --> 01:28:27.900 align:start position:0%
when they do that
 
01:28:27.900 --> 01:28:31.430 align:start position:0%
when they do that
[Music]

01:28:31.430 --> 01:28:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:35.830 --> 01:28:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:40.070 align:start position:0%
 
revenues

01:28:40.070 --> 01:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:42.229 --> 01:28:42.239 align:start position:0%
like 12 million dollars the first year
 
01:28:44.550 --> 01:28:44.560 align:start position:0%
rather than four
 
01:28:48.870 --> 01:28:48.880 align:start position:0%
in the second year approximately 52
 
01:28:54.229 --> 01:28:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:57.990 --> 01:28:58.000 align:start position:0%
and uh instead of our
 
01:29:01.590 --> 01:29:01.600 align:start position:0%
11 million dollars so it still is going
 
01:29:03.510 --> 01:29:03.520 align:start position:0%
to happen
 
01:29:08.830 --> 01:29:08.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:08.840 --> 01:29:10.310 align:start position:0%
 
amount

01:29:10.310 --> 01:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
amount
 
01:29:13.910 --> 01:29:13.920 align:start position:0%
so if it would add another
 
01:29:15.830 --> 01:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
12 million dollar reduction the first
 
01:29:15.840 --> 01:29:17.750 align:start position:0%
12 million dollar reduction the first
year

01:29:17.750 --> 01:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:29:22.950 --> 01:29:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:27.030 --> 01:29:27.040 align:start position:0%
probably another 44 million dollars
 
01:29:30.229 --> 01:29:30.239 align:start position:0%
the second year reduction in revenues so
 
01:29:33.270 --> 01:29:33.280 align:start position:0%
that's been considered
 
01:29:39.189 --> 01:29:39.199 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to bring you up to date on
 
01:29:41.350 --> 01:29:41.360 align:start position:0%
and i'm sure things are gonna come up
 
01:29:41.360 --> 01:29:42.709 align:start position:0%
and i'm sure things are gonna come up
tomorrow

01:29:42.709 --> 01:29:42.719 align:start position:0%
tomorrow
 
01:29:45.750 --> 01:29:45.760 align:start position:0%
and the day after each day
 
01:29:49.270 --> 01:29:49.280 align:start position:0%
and if we need to call you back
 
01:29:51.990 --> 01:29:52.000 align:start position:0%
so that we can evaluate and do that and
 
01:29:54.870 --> 01:29:54.880 align:start position:0%
those that can join us
 
01:29:59.189 --> 01:29:59.199 align:start position:0%
will be appreciated questions
 
01:30:03.430 --> 01:30:03.440 align:start position:0%
mr chairman you do realize
 
01:30:06.629 --> 01:30:06.639 align:start position:0%
that if you do that on
 
01:30:09.669 --> 01:30:09.679 align:start position:0%
you will be on on
 
01:30:12.870 --> 01:30:12.880 align:start position:0%
refusing any help from the
 
01:30:15.830 --> 01:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
american rescue plan for new hampshire
 
01:30:17.510 --> 01:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
as i understand it maybe
 
01:30:19.990 --> 01:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
reps in advance it's got that a little
 
01:30:21.430 --> 01:30:21.440 align:start position:0%
clearer than i do
 
01:30:23.350 --> 01:30:23.360 align:start position:0%
and that's the one that is being argued
 
01:30:25.030 --> 01:30:25.040 align:start position:0%
about in dc
 
01:30:28.149 --> 01:30:28.159 align:start position:0%
that's why we need to get somebody to
 
01:30:29.750 --> 01:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
meet with us
 
01:30:33.669 --> 01:30:33.679 align:start position:0%
that understands what they passed in
 
01:30:36.470 --> 01:30:36.480 align:start position:0%
and what we can and what we can't do and
 
01:30:38.149 --> 01:30:38.159 align:start position:0%
what the ramifications
 
01:30:42.950 --> 01:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:46.790 --> 01:30:46.800 align:start position:0%
and if we can get somebody next week
 
01:30:48.709 --> 01:30:48.719 align:start position:0%
i'm going to schedule it i'm going to
 
01:30:55.189 --> 01:30:55.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:59.510 --> 01:30:59.520 align:start position:0%
any further questions or comments
 
01:31:03.669 --> 01:31:03.679 align:start position:0%
i i have a question a representative
 
01:31:07.510 --> 01:31:07.520 align:start position:0%
so i know that you and
 
01:31:09.990 --> 01:31:10.000 align:start position:0%
others on ways and means have been
 
01:31:11.990 --> 01:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
concerned about the credit carryover
 
01:31:13.990 --> 01:31:14.000 align:start position:0%
issue for some time
 
01:31:16.149 --> 01:31:16.159 align:start position:0%
but i don't think it's been a general
 
01:31:17.830 --> 01:31:17.840 align:start position:0%
interest in the state
 
01:31:19.990 --> 01:31:20.000 align:start position:0%
are you finding that people understand
 
01:31:21.669 --> 01:31:21.679 align:start position:0%
quickly the concept
 
01:31:25.110 --> 01:31:25.120 align:start position:0%
behind why there's been concern
 
01:31:27.270 --> 01:31:27.280 align:start position:0%
and why now something has been passed to
 
01:31:29.590 --> 01:31:29.600 align:start position:0%
deal with it
 
01:31:32.950 --> 01:31:32.960 align:start position:0%
right most people have no idea what it
 
01:31:32.960 --> 01:31:34.229 align:start position:0%
right most people have no idea what it
is

01:31:34.229 --> 01:31:34.239 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:31:36.950 --> 01:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
and those that those that how does how
 
01:31:38.149 --> 01:31:38.159 align:start position:0%
do we
 
01:31:39.990 --> 01:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
how do we get people to understand
 
01:31:41.270 --> 01:31:41.280 align:start position:0%
enough to under
 
01:31:45.030 --> 01:31:45.040 align:start position:0%
to recognize that something's being
 
01:31:47.590 --> 01:31:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:51.030 --> 01:31:51.040 align:start position:0%
that leaves less money available
 
01:31:53.750 --> 01:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
you know the starting point is is to
 
01:31:55.910 --> 01:31:55.920 align:start position:0%
bring it up before the committee
 
01:31:58.709 --> 01:31:58.719 align:start position:0%
and if the committee understands what it
 
01:31:58.719 --> 01:31:59.110 align:start position:0%
and if the committee understands what it
is

01:31:59.110 --> 01:31:59.120 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:32:02.310 --> 01:32:02.320 align:start position:0%
and makes it it makes a comment
 
01:32:05.270 --> 01:32:05.280 align:start position:0%
then they'll say well the committee has
 
01:32:07.110 --> 01:32:07.120 align:start position:0%
looked into this this is what they come
 
01:32:10.950 --> 01:32:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:15.189 --> 01:32:15.199 align:start position:0%
if we don't do our job this is going to
 
01:32:18.950 --> 01:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
go on longer and it could get worse
 
01:32:20.870 --> 01:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
you know if i was a big business you
 
01:32:22.709 --> 01:32:22.719 align:start position:0%
know and i found a place where i could
 
01:32:22.719 --> 01:32:24.229 align:start position:0%
know and i found a place where i could
park

01:32:24.229 --> 01:32:24.239 align:start position:0%
park
 
01:32:26.470 --> 01:32:26.480 align:start position:0%
my profits and not have to worry about
 
01:32:27.830 --> 01:32:27.840 align:start position:0%
paying taxes on
 
01:32:32.229 --> 01:32:32.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:36.070 --> 01:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
if they are forced to take it out
 
01:32:37.990 --> 01:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
if they didn't target there they'd have
 
01:32:39.669 --> 01:32:39.679 align:start position:0%
to pay 21
 
01:32:43.110 --> 01:32:43.120 align:start position:0%
on it and then knowing that
 
01:32:46.149 --> 01:32:46.159 align:start position:0%
corporate taxes probably will
 
01:32:49.030 --> 01:32:49.040 align:start position:0%
possibility is going to be going up to
 
01:32:50.790 --> 01:32:50.800 align:start position:0%
the old rates of 31
 
01:32:55.910 --> 01:32:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:58.629 --> 01:32:58.639 align:start position:0%
in taxes i know earlier today you
 
01:33:00.229 --> 01:33:00.239 align:start position:0%
mentioned that it was important that
 
01:33:03.229 --> 01:33:03.239 align:start position:0%
people understand the
 
01:33:05.910 --> 01:33:05.920 align:start position:0%
transparency behind the
 
01:33:09.110 --> 01:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
current use formula
 
01:33:12.629 --> 01:33:12.639 align:start position:0%
but this that's minor compared to this
 
01:33:15.910 --> 01:33:15.920 align:start position:0%
and i i just want to know whether you
 
01:33:16.629 --> 01:33:16.639 align:start position:0%
think that's
 
01:33:20.790 --> 01:33:20.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:24.629 --> 01:33:24.639 align:start position:0%
i think this is a case we all experience
 
01:33:27.750 --> 01:33:27.760 align:start position:0%
is that we have committees
 
01:33:31.110 --> 01:33:31.120 align:start position:0%
that concentrate efficient game
 
01:33:33.350 --> 01:33:33.360 align:start position:0%
or health and human services or
 
01:33:34.790 --> 01:33:34.800 align:start position:0%
transportation they
 
01:33:37.189 --> 01:33:37.199 align:start position:0%
they concentrate on a small area of the
 
01:33:37.199 --> 01:33:38.550 align:start position:0%
they concentrate on a small area of the
universe

01:33:38.550 --> 01:33:38.560 align:start position:0%
universe
 
01:33:41.910 --> 01:33:41.920 align:start position:0%
and they go through one of these bills
 
01:33:41.920 --> 01:33:42.870 align:start position:0%
and they go through one of these bills
thoroughly

01:33:42.870 --> 01:33:42.880 align:start position:0%
thoroughly
 
01:33:45.590 --> 01:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
we concentrate on revenues and then when
 
01:33:47.350 --> 01:33:47.360 align:start position:0%
we come up with
 
01:33:49.750 --> 01:33:49.760 align:start position:0%
those people that have no idea what's
 
01:33:51.270 --> 01:33:51.280 align:start position:0%
going on we'll have faith
 
01:33:54.070 --> 01:33:54.080 align:start position:0%
and and support us it's the same if we
 
01:33:54.080 --> 01:33:54.390 align:start position:0%
and and support us it's the same if we
have

01:33:54.390 --> 01:33:54.400 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:33:57.189 --> 01:33:57.199 align:start position:0%
faith in what they do and support them
 
01:33:58.790 --> 01:33:58.800 align:start position:0%
until they really screw up
 
01:34:01.510 --> 01:34:01.520 align:start position:0%
when they screw up then that support may
 
01:34:03.350 --> 01:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
not be there
 
01:34:05.270 --> 01:34:05.280 align:start position:0%
so do you think that is there further
 
01:34:07.990 --> 01:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
changes in dividends and interest
 
01:34:11.350 --> 01:34:11.360 align:start position:0%
uh taxation that the two get
 
01:34:13.110 --> 01:34:13.120 align:start position:0%
mingled in people's minds or they're
 
01:34:14.950 --> 01:34:14.960 align:start position:0%
quite separate
 
01:34:18.709 --> 01:34:18.719 align:start position:0%
oh i think they could easily get mingled
 
01:34:22.070 --> 01:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
the uh they get mingled in line i have
 
01:34:23.590 --> 01:34:23.600 align:start position:0%
to make sure i'm
 
01:34:27.189 --> 01:34:27.199 align:start position:0%
talking about the right thing is it that
 
01:34:32.149 --> 01:34:32.159 align:start position:0%
changes is it um
 
01:34:36.790 --> 01:34:36.800 align:start position:0%
cco changes is it the ind
 
01:34:40.070 --> 01:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
changes the business
 
01:34:43.910 --> 01:34:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:46.870 --> 01:34:46.880 align:start position:0%
we all have a problem trying to keep
 
01:34:49.189 --> 01:34:49.199 align:start position:0%
these things
 
01:34:54.470 --> 01:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:58.229 --> 01:34:58.239 align:start position:0%
if i may suggest on i explained this to
 
01:35:00.070 --> 01:35:00.080 align:start position:0%
mary beth waltz the other day
 
01:35:03.350 --> 01:35:03.360 align:start position:0%
with just two sentences on the
 
01:35:06.629 --> 01:35:06.639 align:start position:0%
state has been taking in
 
01:35:11.189 --> 01:35:11.199 align:start position:0%
on more revenue than we were entitled to
 
01:35:14.470 --> 01:35:14.480 align:start position:0%
for quite a long time and
 
01:35:17.750 --> 01:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
on we have spent it
 
01:35:21.270 --> 01:35:21.280 align:start position:0%
and we owe it to the people that left it
 
01:35:21.280 --> 01:35:22.550 align:start position:0%
and we owe it to the people that left it
there

01:35:22.550 --> 01:35:22.560 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:35:26.790 --> 01:35:26.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:30.550 --> 01:35:30.560 align:start position:0%
and we're going to by recognizing this
 
01:35:34.229 --> 01:35:34.239 align:start position:0%
and not kicking the can down the road
 
01:35:40.830 --> 01:35:40.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:40.840 --> 01:35:44.870 align:start position:0%
 
time

01:35:44.870 --> 01:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:49.590 --> 01:35:49.600 align:start position:0%
and our risk that they'll ask for it yes
 
01:35:53.030 --> 01:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
can you imagine i mean in three or four
 
01:35:53.040 --> 01:35:53.510 align:start position:0%
can you imagine i mean in three or four
years

01:35:53.510 --> 01:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:35:56.149 --> 01:35:56.159 align:start position:0%
it increased 100 million dollars you're
 
01:35:58.070 --> 01:35:58.080 align:start position:0%
talking over a quarter of a billion
 
01:35:58.080 --> 01:35:59.030 align:start position:0%
talking over a quarter of a billion
dollars

01:35:59.030 --> 01:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:36:02.470 --> 01:36:02.480 align:start position:0%
that's not our money that
 
01:36:08.830 --> 01:36:08.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:08.840 --> 01:36:16.470 align:start position:0%
 
representing

01:36:16.470 --> 01:36:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:23.109 --> 01:36:23.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:25.510 --> 01:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
sorry i said some good things would you
 
01:36:27.189 --> 01:36:27.199 align:start position:0%
miss them
 
01:36:31.270 --> 01:36:31.280 align:start position:0%
um they uh i i wasn't going to speak on
 
01:36:31.280 --> 01:36:32.070 align:start position:0%
um they uh i i wasn't going to speak on
this

01:36:32.070 --> 01:36:32.080 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:36:35.910 --> 01:36:35.920 align:start position:0%
credit carryover discussion um
 
01:36:38.950 --> 01:36:38.960 align:start position:0%
but i feel i need to um because
 
01:36:40.870 --> 01:36:40.880 align:start position:0%
uh from my perspective it's not as
 
01:36:43.189 --> 01:36:43.199 align:start position:0%
definitive a situation as
 
01:36:47.030 --> 01:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
has been stated um in this discussion
 
01:36:49.750 --> 01:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
uh i if you recall when we debated this
 
01:36:50.790 --> 01:36:50.800 align:start position:0%
question i
 
01:36:53.830 --> 01:36:53.840 align:start position:0%
i put forward the commission idea and i
 
01:36:53.840 --> 01:36:54.149 align:start position:0%
i put forward the commission idea and i
said

01:36:54.149 --> 01:36:54.159 align:start position:0%
said
 
01:36:56.790 --> 01:36:56.800 align:start position:0%
as backup for that that the documents
 
01:36:58.390 --> 01:36:58.400 align:start position:0%
that we'd received
 
01:37:02.070 --> 01:37:02.080 align:start position:0%
um from the comptroller
 
01:37:04.870 --> 01:37:04.880 align:start position:0%
were very informative but what they
 
01:37:06.629 --> 01:37:06.639 align:start position:0%
showed to me was there
 
01:37:08.790 --> 01:37:08.800 align:start position:0%
there had been an ongoing discussion of
 
01:37:10.950 --> 01:37:10.960 align:start position:0%
a very complex issue
 
01:37:14.229 --> 01:37:14.239 align:start position:0%
relating to um
 
01:37:17.030 --> 01:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
these credits that are carried over that
 
01:37:17.040 --> 01:37:17.430 align:start position:0%
these credits that are carried over that
uh

01:37:17.430 --> 01:37:17.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:37:21.270 --> 01:37:21.280 align:start position:0%
represent an insignificant part
 
01:37:24.709 --> 01:37:24.719 align:start position:0%
a moving target the word churn was used
 
01:37:24.719 --> 01:37:25.430 align:start position:0%
a moving target the word churn was used
in

01:37:25.430 --> 01:37:25.440 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:37:28.870 --> 01:37:28.880 align:start position:0%
one of those documents and that i felt
 
01:37:32.310 --> 01:37:32.320 align:start position:0%
that we could take time
 
01:37:34.629 --> 01:37:34.639 align:start position:0%
to have a commission work on the issue
 
01:37:36.390 --> 01:37:36.400 align:start position:0%
before taking
 
01:37:39.669 --> 01:37:39.679 align:start position:0%
any definitive action
 
01:37:43.430 --> 01:37:43.440 align:start position:0%
in the end we voted to uh take
 
01:37:46.470 --> 01:37:46.480 align:start position:0%
definitive action that the chairs
 
01:37:49.669 --> 01:37:49.679 align:start position:0%
already described
 
01:37:53.109 --> 01:37:53.119 align:start position:0%
and i voted against that but i then
 
01:37:54.550 --> 01:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
voted for
 
01:37:58.709 --> 01:37:58.719 align:start position:0%
the combined commission plus taking that
 
01:38:01.430 --> 01:38:01.440 align:start position:0%
low end definitive action but i would
 
01:38:03.350 --> 01:38:03.360 align:start position:0%
have been comfortable just taking
 
01:38:05.430 --> 01:38:05.440 align:start position:0%
the commission approach because of what
 
01:38:06.550 --> 01:38:06.560 align:start position:0%
i've just said
 
01:38:08.950 --> 01:38:08.960 align:start position:0%
i don't think it's as definitive a
 
01:38:10.149 --> 01:38:10.159 align:start position:0%
situation as
 
01:38:13.830 --> 01:38:13.840 align:start position:0%
has been um stated and
 
01:38:17.750 --> 01:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
i i'd prefer to see a
 
01:38:21.510 --> 01:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
exploration by a commission
 
01:38:25.109 --> 01:38:25.119 align:start position:0%
composed of comprised of made up of the
 
01:38:27.189 --> 01:38:27.199 align:start position:0%
of the people who can really dig into
 
01:38:28.790 --> 01:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
this kind of stuff
 
01:38:32.149 --> 01:38:32.159 align:start position:0%
and advise us and what uh is needed
 
01:38:35.030 --> 01:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
but in any event i'm supporting the
 
01:38:36.070 --> 01:38:36.080 align:start position:0%
proposal that's
 
01:38:39.830 --> 01:38:39.840 align:start position:0%
now in the in out in
 
01:38:43.109 --> 01:38:43.119 align:start position:0%
i guess in the pending version of house
 
01:38:45.030 --> 01:38:45.040 align:start position:0%
bill 2 before the finance committee
 
01:38:48.229 --> 01:38:48.239 align:start position:0%
and that's fine but i don't want it to
 
01:38:48.239 --> 01:38:48.629 align:start position:0%
and that's fine but i don't want it to
be

01:38:48.629 --> 01:38:48.639 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:38:50.950 --> 01:38:50.960 align:start position:0%
thought that that's the only way to look
 
01:38:52.149 --> 01:38:52.159 align:start position:0%
at this
 
01:38:54.310 --> 01:38:54.320 align:start position:0%
yeah and that commission was an
 
01:38:54.320 --> 01:38:55.270 align:start position:0%
yeah and that commission was an
excellent

01:38:55.270 --> 01:38:55.280 align:start position:0%
excellent
 
01:38:58.310 --> 01:38:58.320 align:start position:0%
idea and it's going to
 
01:38:58.320 --> 01:39:01.350 align:start position:0%
idea and it's going to
uh

01:39:01.350 --> 01:39:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:03.990 --> 01:39:04.000 align:start position:0%
be started immediately upon passage of
 
01:39:05.910 --> 01:39:05.920 align:start position:0%
house bill 2.
 
01:39:09.430 --> 01:39:09.440 align:start position:0%
and hopefully the way it is
 
01:39:12.550 --> 01:39:12.560 align:start position:0%
now what we voted as a committee
 
01:39:14.629 --> 01:39:14.639 align:start position:0%
it's only going to affect the four
 
01:39:16.790 --> 01:39:16.800 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
01:39:19.189 --> 01:39:19.199 align:start position:0%
in the first year 11 million dollars the
 
01:39:20.470 --> 01:39:20.480 align:start position:0%
second year
 
01:39:23.510 --> 01:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
not the huge amount of
 
01:39:26.870 --> 01:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
46 million and 81 million
 
01:39:30.790 --> 01:39:30.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:34.070 --> 01:39:34.080 align:start position:0%
the governor's plan because he he didn't
 
01:39:35.030 --> 01:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
even put the
 
01:39:39.430 --> 01:39:39.440 align:start position:0%
uh those in as we disregards they didn't
 
01:39:39.440 --> 01:39:40.070 align:start position:0%
uh those in as we disregards they didn't
recognize

01:39:40.070 --> 01:39:40.080 align:start position:0%
recognize
 
01:39:43.270 --> 01:39:43.280 align:start position:0%
it but i think we did the right thing we
 
01:39:44.310 --> 01:39:44.320 align:start position:0%
recognized it
 
01:39:47.030 --> 01:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
we formed the commission based upon your
 
01:39:47.040 --> 01:39:48.870 align:start position:0%
we formed the commission based upon your
recommendation

01:39:48.870 --> 01:39:48.880 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
01:39:51.189 --> 01:39:51.199 align:start position:0%
we minimized the disruption to our
 
01:39:52.629 --> 01:39:52.639 align:start position:0%
revenues by
 
01:39:55.109 --> 01:39:55.119 align:start position:0%
making it the smallest amount four and
 
01:39:58.149 --> 01:39:58.159 align:start position:0%
11 million dollars
 
01:40:01.189 --> 01:40:01.199 align:start position:0%
and hopefully we'll get a solution by
 
01:40:05.189 --> 01:40:05.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:08.709 --> 01:40:08.719 align:start position:0%
representative thank you i think the
 
01:40:10.709 --> 01:40:10.719 align:start position:0%
difference is that those of us
 
01:40:14.629 --> 01:40:14.639 align:start position:0%
in here a long time know how hard it is
 
01:40:17.750 --> 01:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
to get on something done
 
01:40:21.270 --> 01:40:21.280 align:start position:0%
that's going to cost money in the budget
 
01:40:24.870 --> 01:40:24.880 align:start position:0%
and by putting this in the budget now
 
01:40:26.790 --> 01:40:26.800 align:start position:0%
we make it a lot easier for the
 
01:40:26.800 --> 01:40:27.990 align:start position:0%
we make it a lot easier for the
commission's

01:40:27.990 --> 01:40:28.000 align:start position:0%
commission's
 
01:40:33.830 --> 01:40:33.840 align:start position:0%
report to be on to be used to amend that
 
01:40:36.149 --> 01:40:36.159 align:start position:0%
than we would if we were starting out in
 
01:40:37.350 --> 01:40:37.360 align:start position:0%
yet another term
 
01:40:40.870 --> 01:40:40.880 align:start position:0%
we had the education
 
01:40:42.950 --> 01:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
funding commission which cost a lot of
 
01:40:42.960 --> 01:40:43.990 align:start position:0%
funding commission which cost a lot of
money

01:40:43.990 --> 01:40:44.000 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:40:47.669 --> 01:40:47.679 align:start position:0%
now they're ignoring it we had the
 
01:40:51.189 --> 01:40:51.199 align:start position:0%
uh a number of years ago the business
 
01:40:54.310 --> 01:40:54.320 align:start position:0%
uh tax commission on
 
01:40:57.830 --> 01:40:57.840 align:start position:0%
they picked picked a few things out of
 
01:40:59.590 --> 01:40:59.600 align:start position:0%
it and left the majority of the
 
01:41:01.270 --> 01:41:01.280 align:start position:0%
the conclusions even though it was run
 
01:41:02.709 --> 01:41:02.719 align:start position:0%
by businessmen and
 
01:41:05.910 --> 01:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
very well done i thought on we had the
 
01:41:05.920 --> 01:41:07.030 align:start position:0%
very well done i thought on we had the
business

01:41:07.030 --> 01:41:07.040 align:start position:0%
business
 
01:41:10.870 --> 01:41:10.880 align:start position:0%
uh the commission on a couple of years
 
01:41:10.880 --> 01:41:11.430 align:start position:0%
uh the commission on a couple of years
ago

01:41:11.430 --> 01:41:11.440 align:start position:0%
ago
 
01:41:14.629 --> 01:41:14.639 align:start position:0%
for market-based sourcing and
 
01:41:18.229 --> 01:41:18.239 align:start position:0%
the single sales factor we were going to
 
01:41:20.709 --> 01:41:20.719 align:start position:0%
not do the single sales factor until we
 
01:41:22.229 --> 01:41:22.239 align:start position:0%
were comfortable with market-based
 
01:41:22.239 --> 01:41:23.189 align:start position:0%
were comfortable with market-based
sourcing

01:41:23.189 --> 01:41:23.199 align:start position:0%
sourcing
 
01:41:25.990 --> 01:41:26.000 align:start position:0%
uh senator and the governor jumped in
 
01:41:27.910 --> 01:41:27.920 align:start position:0%
and forced us to do it
 
01:41:31.629 --> 01:41:31.639 align:start position:0%
yesterday the on senate
 
01:41:34.870 --> 01:41:34.880 align:start position:0%
unanimously voted uh to kill
 
01:41:36.870 --> 01:41:36.880 align:start position:0%
the bill that we sent over to them about
 
01:41:38.310 --> 01:41:38.320 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
01:41:41.350 --> 01:41:41.360 align:start position:0%
so i'm very glad it's going into the
 
01:41:43.109 --> 01:41:43.119 align:start position:0%
budget on our side so that that
 
01:41:45.350 --> 01:41:45.360 align:start position:0%
conversation can continue
 
01:41:49.030 --> 01:41:49.040 align:start position:0%
but it is really really hard to get
 
01:41:52.070 --> 01:41:52.080 align:start position:0%
get the finance committees to
 
01:41:54.870 --> 01:41:54.880 align:start position:0%
to do what is needed to be done to avoid
 
01:41:56.229 --> 01:41:56.239 align:start position:0%
problems in the future
 
01:41:59.350 --> 01:41:59.360 align:start position:0%
and this this gives us
 
01:42:03.350 --> 01:42:03.360 align:start position:0%
a leg into getting whatever it is that
 
01:42:05.030 --> 01:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
needs to be done after that commission
 
01:42:06.229 --> 01:42:06.239 align:start position:0%
is done done
 
01:42:09.270 --> 01:42:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:13.350 --> 01:42:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:15.189 --> 01:42:15.199 align:start position:0%
representative romney and then maybe we
 
01:42:17.189 --> 01:42:17.199 align:start position:0%
should wrap it up and so we can have our
 
01:42:17.199 --> 01:42:18.790 align:start position:0%
should wrap it up and so we can have our
caucuses

01:42:18.790 --> 01:42:18.800 align:start position:0%
caucuses
 
01:42:21.109 --> 01:42:21.119 align:start position:0%
is that going representative romney yeah
 
01:42:22.070 --> 01:42:22.080 align:start position:0%
i just want to
 
01:42:25.030 --> 01:42:25.040 align:start position:0%
weigh in on house bill 281 uh yes uh
 
01:42:26.470 --> 01:42:26.480 align:start position:0%
both susan and i were on the
 
01:42:28.629 --> 01:42:28.639 align:start position:0%
on the zoom with uh senate ways and
 
01:42:30.310 --> 01:42:30.320 align:start position:0%
means yesterday
 
01:42:33.510 --> 01:42:33.520 align:start position:0%
and uh i i introduced a bill
 
01:42:36.790 --> 01:42:36.800 align:start position:0%
uh i testified susan testified uh
 
01:42:38.229 --> 01:42:38.239 align:start position:0%
it seemed like the committee already had
 
01:42:39.990 --> 01:42:40.000 align:start position:0%
their mind made up only the only
 
01:42:42.390 --> 01:42:42.400 align:start position:0%
bright spot was senator d'alessandro
 
01:42:42.400 --> 01:42:43.030 align:start position:0%
bright spot was senator d'alessandro
saying

01:42:43.030 --> 01:42:43.040 align:start position:0%
saying
 
01:42:44.310 --> 01:42:44.320 align:start position:0%
well maybe we should take a little more
 
01:42:46.149 --> 01:42:46.159 align:start position:0%
time um
 
01:42:49.109 --> 01:42:49.119 align:start position:0%
and uh and involve the dra a little bit
 
01:42:49.119 --> 01:42:50.149 align:start position:0%
and uh and involve the dra a little bit
more

01:42:50.149 --> 01:42:50.159 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:42:52.229 --> 01:42:52.239 align:start position:0%
uh is my recollection of what happened
 
01:42:53.430 --> 01:42:53.440 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:42:56.870 --> 01:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
the surprisingly story was on the call
 
01:42:58.790 --> 01:42:58.800 align:start position:0%
uh but they never called them they never
 
01:43:00.470 --> 01:43:00.480 align:start position:0%
asked for their
 
01:43:04.229 --> 01:43:04.239 align:start position:0%
uh testimony uh yesterday so so that
 
01:43:05.910 --> 01:43:05.920 align:start position:0%
three of just while we're on that three
 
01:43:07.350 --> 01:43:07.360 align:start position:0%
other bills passed that
 
01:43:09.189 --> 01:43:09.199 align:start position:0%
came out of our committee they they
 
01:43:09.199 --> 01:43:10.470 align:start position:0%
came out of our committee they they
exact

01:43:10.470 --> 01:43:10.480 align:start position:0%
exact
 
01:43:13.030 --> 01:43:13.040 align:start position:0%
uh the opt-in change for sports betting
 
01:43:14.390 --> 01:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
the language change
 
01:43:17.750 --> 01:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
no big deal um representative major's
 
01:43:17.760 --> 01:43:18.870 align:start position:0%
no big deal um representative major's
bill

01:43:18.870 --> 01:43:18.880 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:43:22.310 --> 01:43:22.320 align:start position:0%
on emergency situations being able to do
 
01:43:22.320 --> 01:43:23.830 align:start position:0%
on emergency situations being able to do
multiple

01:43:23.830 --> 01:43:23.840 align:start position:0%
multiple
 
01:43:27.189 --> 01:43:27.199 align:start position:0%
revenue estimates they amended that
 
01:43:30.790 --> 01:43:30.800 align:start position:0%
to say that that when we do it
 
01:43:34.390 --> 01:43:34.400 align:start position:0%
to please inform the senate
 
01:43:37.510 --> 01:43:37.520 align:start position:0%
so that passed and then the housekeeping
 
01:43:38.870 --> 01:43:38.880 align:start position:0%
bill we have from the dra
 
01:43:41.910 --> 01:43:41.920 align:start position:0%
house bill 324 uh
 
01:43:45.990 --> 01:43:46.000 align:start position:0%
passed as well and fyi
 
01:43:49.310 --> 01:43:49.320 align:start position:0%
uh they took up senate bill
 
01:43:53.950 --> 01:43:53.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:53.960 --> 01:43:56.870 align:start position:0%
 
10112

01:43:56.870 --> 01:43:56.880 align:start position:0%
10112
 
01:43:58.950 --> 01:43:58.960 align:start position:0%
which was is their version of the
 
01:44:00.310 --> 01:44:00.320 align:start position:0%
historic racing bill
 
01:44:02.870 --> 01:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
and they uh interestingly enough without
 
01:44:02.880 --> 01:44:04.229 align:start position:0%
and they uh interestingly enough without
debate

01:44:04.229 --> 01:44:04.239 align:start position:0%
debate
 
01:44:07.750 --> 01:44:07.760 align:start position:0%
uh uh passed it unanimously
 
01:44:11.750 --> 01:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
thank you and doing what they did
 
01:44:15.030 --> 01:44:15.040 align:start position:0%
on the single sales factor we
 
01:44:19.590 --> 01:44:19.600 align:start position:0%
said that by delaying it
 
01:44:21.590 --> 01:44:21.600 align:start position:0%
it would put 20 million dollars back
 
01:44:23.270 --> 01:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
into the budget
 
01:44:25.189 --> 01:44:25.199 align:start position:0%
now it's going to take that 20 million
 
01:44:28.950 --> 01:44:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:31.830 --> 01:44:31.840 align:start position:0%
so well again we have a single swing
 
01:44:34.149 --> 01:44:34.159 align:start position:0%
well we have a second bite at the apple
 
01:44:37.270 --> 01:44:37.280 align:start position:0%
um since it's in the budget
 
01:44:39.030 --> 01:44:39.040 align:start position:0%
yeah i imagine that'll be a committee a
 
01:44:41.189 --> 01:44:41.199 align:start position:0%
conference uh thing i i
 
01:44:43.750 --> 01:44:43.760 align:start position:0%
there's leverage there uh depending on
 
01:44:44.950 --> 01:44:44.960 align:start position:0%
how the negotiations
 
01:44:48.629 --> 01:44:48.639 align:start position:0%
go in the committee of this is why i
 
01:44:49.990 --> 01:44:50.000 align:start position:0%
think it's important
 
01:44:53.430 --> 01:44:53.440 align:start position:0%
that we be able to meet as these things
 
01:44:53.440 --> 01:44:54.629 align:start position:0%
that we be able to meet as these things
develop

01:44:54.629 --> 01:44:54.639 align:start position:0%
develop
 
01:44:58.790 --> 01:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
and understand as much as we can
 
01:45:01.030 --> 01:45:01.040 align:start position:0%
all the time we go to the committee
 
01:45:01.040 --> 01:45:05.030 align:start position:0%
all the time we go to the committee
conference

01:45:05.030 --> 01:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:08.950 --> 01:45:08.960 align:start position:0%
um okay can we break mr chairman can i
 
01:45:10.790 --> 01:45:10.800 align:start position:0%
just make one more request if
 
01:45:13.910 --> 01:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
you could figure out on tuesday
 
01:45:17.189 --> 01:45:17.199 align:start position:0%
when we'd be meeting maybe we can
 
01:45:20.470 --> 01:45:20.480 align:start position:0%
negotiate a way that representative ames
 
01:45:22.629 --> 01:45:22.639 align:start position:0%
and i can
 
01:45:25.750 --> 01:45:25.760 align:start position:0%
can participate okay
 
01:45:28.149 --> 01:45:28.159 align:start position:0%
um why don't we get on the phone and try
 
01:45:31.109 --> 01:45:31.119 align:start position:0%
to figure that out
 
01:45:34.229 --> 01:45:34.239 align:start position:0%
you work it out with rep and call me and
 
01:45:34.239 --> 01:45:36.229 align:start position:0%
you work it out with rep and call me and
then

01:45:36.229 --> 01:45:36.239 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:45:38.790 --> 01:45:38.800 align:start position:0%
it's our problem is not us our problem
 
01:45:39.669 --> 01:45:39.679 align:start position:0%
is our
 
01:45:42.709 --> 01:45:42.719 align:start position:0%
is our leadership we have to have
 
01:45:44.790 --> 01:45:44.800 align:start position:0%
meetings with our leadership
 
01:45:48.310 --> 01:45:48.320 align:start position:0%
yeah the same or same with us
 
01:45:51.430 --> 01:45:51.440 align:start position:0%
that's why tomorrow oh
 
01:45:56.149 --> 01:45:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:57.990 --> 01:45:58.000 align:start position:0%
representative bernstein is going to
 
01:46:00.070 --> 01:46:00.080 align:start position:0%
open the meeting at
 
01:46:04.870 --> 01:46:04.880 align:start position:0%
nine o'clock and then recess it until
 
01:46:08.149 --> 01:46:08.159 align:start position:0%
10 30. and the reason for that
 
01:46:10.830 --> 01:46:10.840 align:start position:0%
we have to have meetings of our
 
01:46:10.840 --> 01:46:14.070 align:start position:0%
we have to have meetings of our
leadership

01:46:14.070 --> 01:46:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:18.790 --> 01:46:18.800 align:start position:0%
and so at 10 30 we will actually be
 
01:46:21.990 --> 01:46:22.000 align:start position:0%
opening up meeting and we'll have our
 
01:46:25.750 --> 01:46:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:29.510 --> 01:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
i think okay
 
01:46:33.510 --> 01:46:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:37.510 --> 01:46:37.520 align:start position:0%
all right can we
 
01:46:39.910 --> 01:46:39.920 align:start position:0%
break up now and i'll send out a link to
 
01:46:40.950 --> 01:46:40.960 align:start position:0%
the republicans
 
01:46:45.830 --> 01:46:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:49.510 --> 01:46:49.520 align:start position:0%
your she's going to send the link again
 
01:46:51.669 --> 01:46:51.679 align:start position:0%
but we do have it so some of us
 
01:46:54.870 --> 01:46:54.880 align:start position:0%
