Market I have all the news as you know
 
00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 align:start position:0%
today I'm introducing s SP 538 an act
 
00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:00.479 align:start position:0%
relative to zoning procedures concerning
 
00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600 align:start position:0%
residential housing as you all know our
 
00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
state is in the midst of a crisis not
 
00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 align:start position:0%
only are there not enough housing units
 
00:05:09.189 --> 00:05:09.199 align:start position:0%
readily available for New Hampshire
 
00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 align:start position:0%
families but the costs of those units
 
00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:12.880 align:start position:0%
are simply becoming too unattainable for
 
00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:15.160 align:start position:0%
the average citizen for years
 
00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:17.000 align:start position:0%
circumnavigating this crisis has been
 
00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 align:start position:0%
one of my main priorities to ensure that
 
00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:20.639 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire can be a place that future
 
00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:22.240 align:start position:0%
Generations can call
 
00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
home I am calling s SP 538 home nibus
 
00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:29.080 align:start position:0%
some of you may have heard this name as
 
00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:30.600 align:start position:0%
amended by the Senate it is now a
 
00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:33.080 align:start position:0%
three-part bill that offers some some
 
00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:35.600 align:start position:0%
additional solutions to address this
 
00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
dire situation our state is facing we
 
00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:40.720 align:start position:0%
all know there is no Silver Bullet to
 
00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:43.120 align:start position:0%
solve the housing crisis we'll need all
 
00:05:46.309 --> 00:05:46.319 align:start position:0%
the different tools that we can muster
 
00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:47.840 align:start position:0%
and put those tools into our
 
00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.230 align:start position:0%
and put those tools into our
municipality's

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:49.240 align:start position:0%
municipality's
 
00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
hands this piece of legislation at this
 
00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:54.400 align:start position:0%
point is largely enabling respecting
 
00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
that our cities and towns are really the
 
00:05:57.749 --> 00:05:57.759 align:start position:0%
ones that are on the front lines of
 
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:00.120 align:start position:0%
solving the housing crisis
 
00:06:01.469 --> 00:06:01.479 align:start position:0%
to walk you through a couple of the
 
00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:04.560 align:start position:0%
pieces inside the bill the first part
 
00:06:07.589 --> 00:06:07.599 align:start position:0%
offers um T local property tax credits
 
00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:11.240 align:start position:0%
for the downtown conversion of office
 
00:06:13.629 --> 00:06:13.639 align:start position:0%
commercial or industrial space into
 
00:06:16.629 --> 00:06:16.639 align:start position:0%
residential units as such it would have
 
00:06:19.029 --> 00:06:19.039 align:start position:0%
to comply with local pre-existing zoning
 
00:06:21.029 --> 00:06:21.039 align:start position:0%
ordinances and when enacted our
 
00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:23.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities would have to Define what
 
00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:26.680 align:start position:0%
their downtown is for the buildings to
 
00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:28.720 align:start position:0%
qualify the second part of the bill
 
00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:30.880 align:start position:0%
enables our select boards to amend
 
00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:32.680 align:start position:0%
zoning this means that the zoning
 
00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:34.440 align:start position:0%
process could be conducted more than
 
00:06:36.909 --> 00:06:36.919 align:start position:0%
once a year and allow for greater public
 
00:06:38.629 --> 00:06:38.639 align:start position:0%
input and
 
00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:41.080 align:start position:0%
hearing the third part of the bill now
 
00:06:42.909 --> 00:06:42.919 align:start position:0%
allows for alternative parking
 
00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:44.720 align:start position:0%
arrangements for housing units to be
 
00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:47.440 align:start position:0%
considered by our local boards this
 
00:06:49.469 --> 00:06:49.479 align:start position:0%
aspect makes it possible for not all
 
00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:51.680 align:start position:0%
parking spaces required for residential
 
00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:54.800 align:start position:0%
units to be on site which would also
 
00:06:58.309 --> 00:06:58.319 align:start position:0%
help provide a tool to lower the cost of
 
00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:01.360 align:start position:0%
housing ultimately to the end
 
00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:03.720 align:start position:0%
user some parts of this bill have been
 
00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:05.360 align:start position:0%
removed by the Senate and I just want to
 
00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:08.360 align:start position:0%
clarify those for everybody here one was
 
00:07:10.189 --> 00:07:10.199 align:start position:0%
concerning soil based slot sizing which
 
00:07:11.909 --> 00:07:11.919 align:start position:0%
is no longer part of the bill and
 
00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
another concerned inclusionary zoning
 
00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:16.240 align:start position:0%
which is also not in here as amended by
 
00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:19.469 align:start position:0%
which is also not in here as amended by
the

00:07:19.469 --> 00:07:19.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:23.189 --> 00:07:23.199 align:start position:0%
Senate this sp sp 538 is intended to be
 
00:07:25.469 --> 00:07:25.479 align:start position:0%
a technical Bill addressing a highly
 
00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
technical problem with hopefully
 
00:07:28.749 --> 00:07:28.759 align:start position:0%
Technical Solutions which again are
 
00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:31.280 align:start position:0%
passed to our municipalities who are
 
00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
really the front lines of this
 
00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
crisis I also view this as a
 
00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:37.520 align:start position:0%
conversation with you about the the
 
00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
board about how we can move this bill
 
00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:42.080 align:start position:0%
forward and I welcome questions I also
 
00:07:43.589 --> 00:07:43.599 align:start position:0%
hope that we can all work together to
 
00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:46.280 align:start position:0%
continue to address this challenge as it
 
00:07:48.869 --> 00:07:48.879 align:start position:0%
faces us this year and in the years to
 
00:07:51.629 --> 00:07:51.639 align:start position:0%
come with that Mr chairman I'm happy to
 
00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:54.440 align:start position:0%
answer any questions that you may have
 
00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:56.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:03.909 --> 00:08:03.919 align:start position:0%
thank you Senator thank you for being
 
00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:06.520 align:start position:0%
here and introducing this bill and I was
 
00:08:09.469 --> 00:08:09.479 align:start position:0%
particularly interested with regards to
 
00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:12.440 align:start position:0%
um section six it's a new section uh
 
00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:15.560 align:start position:0%
starting on page two line 16 so it's
 
00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:17.280 align:start position:0%
adoption of zoning ordinances
 
00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:20.080 align:start position:0%
alternative procedure so my
 
00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:23.560 align:start position:0%
understanding is that this
 
00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:28.360 align:start position:0%
um the legislative body in in a town
 
00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:32.200 align:start position:0%
would would no longer be the body which
 
00:08:34.509 --> 00:08:34.519 align:start position:0%
uh passes zoning
 
00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:37.200 align:start position:0%
ordinances and that would be um
 
00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:41.200 align:start position:0%
transferred to the governing body so I
 
00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:44.360 align:start position:0%
understand that planning boards they're
 
00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:47.600 align:start position:0%
responsible for um researching and
 
00:08:51.949 --> 00:08:51.959 align:start position:0%
analyzing and there's a process that um
 
00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:55.080 align:start position:0%
takes many months typically I believe
 
00:08:57.350 --> 00:08:57.360 align:start position:0%
that they they they the process they
 
00:08:59.470 --> 00:08:59.480 align:start position:0%
start looking at things um maybe in the
 
00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:02.800 align:start position:0%
the summer or early fall would could you
 
00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:04.880 align:start position:0%
explain how that would what that would
 
00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:07.760 align:start position:0%
look like would they still be part of it
 
00:09:09.829 --> 00:09:09.839 align:start position:0%
would they still be putting forward
 
00:09:11.949 --> 00:09:11.959 align:start position:0%
ordinances and the only difference would
 
00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:15.760 align:start position:0%
be that that the um the governing body
 
00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:18.720 align:start position:0%
would would uh pass
 
00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:21.680 align:start position:0%
or would vote to to pass ordinances
 
00:09:23.389 --> 00:09:23.399 align:start position:0%
could you explain that a little bit more
 
00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
for me thank you yeah sure no thank you
 
00:09:27.829 --> 00:09:27.839 align:start position:0%
for the question um because again
 
00:09:29.949 --> 00:09:29.959 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of technical pieces here
 
00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:32.440 align:start position:0%
so just as an important clarification at
 
00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:34.360 align:start position:0%
the outset the local legislative body
 
00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:36.600 align:start position:0%
would have to take action to delegate
 
00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:38.480 align:start position:0%
this authority to the governing body so
 
00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:39.800 align:start position:0%
in other words there would still have to
 
00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:43.200 align:start position:0%
be a town warrant to hand over authority
 
00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:45.360 align:start position:0%
to the select board on zoning ordinances
 
00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:47.000 align:start position:0%
so that that's an action that has to
 
00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
take place in the first place approved
 
00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:51.440 align:start position:0%
by all the voters um what this does is
 
00:09:53.710 --> 00:09:53.720 align:start position:0%
open up an option to essentially as you
 
00:09:56.590 --> 00:09:56.600 align:start position:0%
said um allow the governing body to play
 
00:09:59.829 --> 00:09:59.839 align:start position:0%
the role of you know facil facilitating
 
00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
further public hearings once that
 
00:10:02.829 --> 00:10:02.839 align:start position:0%
referral is received from the planning
 
00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
board or not I think each municipality
 
00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:07.360 align:start position:0%
would have the flexibility to do that
 
00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:08.800 align:start position:0%
planning boards often do play a role
 
00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:11.600 align:start position:0%
which I think is a really um important
 
00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:15.200 align:start position:0%
piece and so um I know on the council we
 
00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:17.360 align:start position:0%
would sort of open up an ordinance refer
 
00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:18.640 align:start position:0%
it to the planning board that's where it
 
00:10:20.069 --> 00:10:20.079 align:start position:0%
would experience some public hearing it
 
00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:22.200 align:start position:0%
would come back to the council you know
 
00:10:24.269 --> 00:10:24.279 align:start position:0%
and and go through additional Hearing in
 
00:10:27.069 --> 00:10:27.079 align:start position:0%
towns I think the procedure is probably
 
00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:29.680 align:start position:0%
a little more flexible but um but again
 
00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:32.000 align:start position:0%
that's something that could be developed
 
00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
by our towns and cities who are really
 
00:10:35.389 --> 00:10:35.399 align:start position:0%
in the best position to figure out um
 
00:10:39.509 --> 00:10:39.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:41.720 align:start position:0%
them representative
 
00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
Holland thank you for taking my question
 
00:10:45.509 --> 00:10:45.519 align:start position:0%
actually just to summarize what you just
 
00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:47.920 align:start position:0%
said uh so this is in essence is really
 
00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:50.200 align:start position:0%
giving the power that a lot of
 
00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:52.200 align:start position:0%
communities that have a town Charter
 
00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
they're able to already do this so this
 
00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:56.160 align:start position:0%
is extending that ability and more
 
00:10:59.629 --> 00:10:59.639 align:start position:0%
flexibility to SP2 towns that's exactly
 
00:11:01.509 --> 00:11:01.519 align:start position:0%
right representative any town could
 
00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:04.440 align:start position:0%
adopt as Durham has um you know the Town
 
00:11:06.269 --> 00:11:06.279 align:start position:0%
Council form of government and do this
 
00:11:06.279 --> 00:11:08.509 align:start position:0%
Council form of government and do this
today

00:11:08.509 --> 00:11:08.519 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:11:13.069 --> 00:11:13.079 align:start position:0%
y further questions representative power
 
00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:14.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for take thank you Mr chairman
 
00:11:16.949 --> 00:11:16.959 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question so
 
00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:19.240 align:start position:0%
with regards to the same section I I'm
 
00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:21.160 align:start position:0%
noticing and I might be missing
 
00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
something but so as you as you had
 
00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:26.320 align:start position:0%
reiterated that this is enabling
 
00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:29.800 align:start position:0%
legislation um for for this transf for
 
00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
of authority I don't see a rescind
 
00:11:36.389 --> 00:11:36.399 align:start position:0%
mechanism was that an oversight or was
 
00:11:39.509 --> 00:11:39.519 align:start position:0%
that um on
 
00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
purpose that's a good question I would
 
00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:46.440 align:start position:0%
have to look into existing statute but I
 
00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:49.120 align:start position:0%
um I assume there are other powers that
 
00:11:51.389 --> 00:11:51.399 align:start position:0%
can be delegated through warrant to a
 
00:11:52.949 --> 00:11:52.959 align:start position:0%
select board and so there's probably an
 
00:11:55.829 --> 00:11:55.839 align:start position:0%
existing statutory mechanism to resend
 
00:11:59.470 --> 00:11:59.480 align:start position:0%
it um but I would be happy to look into
 
00:12:01.069 --> 00:12:01.079 align:start position:0%
that and get back to you we I I'm
 
00:12:02.629 --> 00:12:02.639 align:start position:0%
assuming we weren't trying to reinvent
 
00:12:06.509 --> 00:12:06.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:09.720 align:start position:0%
happened further
 
00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:11.880 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:31.189 --> 00:12:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:32.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman good morning
 
00:12:34.189 --> 00:12:34.199 align:start position:0%
committee members my name is Ben Frost
 
00:12:36.069 --> 00:12:36.079 align:start position:0%
I'm the deputy executive director and
 
00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:37.880 align:start position:0%
chief legal officer at New Hampshire
 
00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:39.800 align:start position:0%
Housing and I'm here to express New
 
00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:41.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire housing's strong and
 
00:12:44.509 --> 00:12:44.519 align:start position:0%
enthusiastic support for Senate Bill
 
00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:50.360 align:start position:0%
538 closer is that better okay um I you
 
00:12:53.629 --> 00:12:53.639 align:start position:0%
know Senator Perkins quoka uh very ay uh
 
00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
introduced the legislation and described
 
00:12:57.750 --> 00:12:57.760 align:start position:0%
its import uh just underscore the
 
00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:00.440 align:start position:0%
importance of anything the legislature
 
00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
can do to help meet uh the state's
 
00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:06.320 align:start position:0%
housing crisis um this is a crisis of
 
00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
housing Supply uh and we we simply do
 
00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:12.040 align:start position:0%
not have enough uh housing to meet the
 
00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:14.440 align:start position:0%
current or anticipated future demand
 
00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:16.440 align:start position:0%
based upon population growth and
 
00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:19.600 align:start position:0%
changing household composition uh the uh
 
00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:23.160 align:start position:0%
elements of Senate Bill 538 uh on their
 
00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
surface may not uh appear necessarily
 
00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:28.880 align:start position:0%
except for the the provision dealing
 
00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:31.680 align:start position:0%
with RSA 79e to be dealing directly with
 
00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:35.320 align:start position:0%
housing but to the extent you make it uh
 
00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:36.720 align:start position:0%
more efficient to change the zoning
 
00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:38.760 align:start position:0%
ordinance to the extent you make it
 
00:13:41.629 --> 00:13:41.639 align:start position:0%
easier to to meet uh local parking
 
00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:44.600 align:start position:0%
requirements then it it becomes easier
 
00:13:47.710 --> 00:13:47.720 align:start position:0%
to develop housing uh and that any of
 
00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:50.680 align:start position:0%
these measures would be a welcome relief
 
00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
to the pressures that developers are
 
00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:55.800 align:start position:0%
facing as they try to make these deals
 
00:14:00.069 --> 00:14:00.079 align:start position:0%
happen um the the first two well
 
00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:02.920 align:start position:0%
sections three and four uh are dealing
 
00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:05.680 align:start position:0%
with RSA 79e which is the community
 
00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:08.320 align:start position:0%
revitalization tax relief incentive this
 
00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
was established by the legislature in
 
00:14:12.949 --> 00:14:12.959 align:start position:0%
2006 and has become one of the most
 
00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:15.680 align:start position:0%
important tools that municipalities have
 
00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:18.120 align:start position:0%
to encourage development it was
 
00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:21.560 align:start position:0%
originally conceived as a uh a Downtown
 
00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:24.720 align:start position:0%
Development Bill uh and and really it
 
00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:27.240 align:start position:0%
was focused on
 
00:14:30.389 --> 00:14:30.399 align:start position:0%
rehabilitating call them der structures
 
00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:34.120 align:start position:0%
in downtown areas uh to give the
 
00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:36.040 align:start position:0%
property owners an incentive a tax
 
00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:38.920 align:start position:0%
incentive essentially uh that they can
 
00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:42.120 align:start position:0%
use to help underwrite the costs of
 
00:14:45.509 --> 00:14:45.519 align:start position:0%
development um and it has taken off
 
00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
since then it's been used and because of
 
00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:50.000 align:start position:0%
its success and and its widespread
 
00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:52.120 align:start position:0%
adoption by municipalities this is
 
00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:53.480 align:start position:0%
purely enabling
 
00:14:56.629 --> 00:14:56.639 align:start position:0%
legislation uh it it has been used uh
 
00:14:59.230 --> 00:14:59.240 align:start position:0%
for a variety of different U measures
 
00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:01.320 align:start position:0%
this uh what is proposed here in senal
 
00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:04.240 align:start position:0%
538 is a new measure a welcome measure
 
00:15:05.470 --> 00:15:05.480 align:start position:0%
that would
 
00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:09.160 align:start position:0%
focus explicitly on the conversions of
 
00:15:12.069 --> 00:15:12.079 align:start position:0%
existing commercial industrial
 
00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:14.240 align:start position:0%
essentially non-residential uses for
 
00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:17.480 align:start position:0%
conversion to residential uses again if
 
00:15:20.629 --> 00:15:20.639 align:start position:0%
a municipality wants to do this this is
 
00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:22.880 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation then it could adopt
 
00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:26.680 align:start position:0%
this measure to allow for uh the RSA 79e
 
00:15:30.509 --> 00:15:30.519 align:start position:0%
to apply to these kinds of developments
 
00:15:34.749 --> 00:15:34.759 align:start position:0%
um with regard to sections five and six
 
00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:37.600 align:start position:0%
this is the uh the change and
 
00:15:39.629 --> 00:15:39.639 align:start position:0%
representative Howland I think you you
 
00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:43.360 align:start position:0%
very um appropriately noted this is like
 
00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:45.480 align:start position:0%
towns with a town counil form of
 
00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:48.160 align:start position:0%
government Charter where the the local
 
00:15:51.509 --> 00:15:51.519 align:start position:0%
legislative body uh is the local
 
00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:54.120 align:start position:0%
governing body uh and cities too also
 
00:15:56.670 --> 00:15:56.680 align:start position:0%
have the same structure um the planning
 
00:15:58.670 --> 00:15:58.680 align:start position:0%
board would still be involved uh it
 
00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:01.240 align:start position:0%
would still have the same role it does
 
00:16:04.269 --> 00:16:04.279 align:start position:0%
have now it's just changing who
 
00:16:07.069 --> 00:16:07.079 align:start position:0%
ultimately has the adoption power over
 
00:16:10.069 --> 00:16:10.079 align:start position:0%
zoning ordinances and as Senator Perkins
 
00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:13.560 align:start position:0%
quote Perkins quoka noted uh this
 
00:16:16.269 --> 00:16:16.279 align:start position:0%
requires a municipality the voters to
 
00:16:18.189 --> 00:16:18.199 align:start position:0%
say yes this is what we want to do it's
 
00:16:20.829 --> 00:16:20.839 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation so if the voters
 
00:16:23.590 --> 00:16:23.600 align:start position:0%
don't want to do it it doesn't happen uh
 
00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:26.040 align:start position:0%
the last section uh oh representative
 
00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:29.720 align:start position:0%
power you had asked about re uh power to
 
00:16:33.189 --> 00:16:33.199 align:start position:0%
resend um in the absence of specific
 
00:16:36.309 --> 00:16:36.319 align:start position:0%
language generally speaking uh the same
 
00:16:39.629 --> 00:16:39.639 align:start position:0%
process is used uh to resend something
 
00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:41.360 align:start position:0%
that is enabling uh that has been
 
00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
previously granted and that's a
 
00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:46.480 align:start position:0%
generally recognized principle of
 
00:16:50.509 --> 00:16:50.519 align:start position:0%
law um so it although that the its
 
00:16:53.470 --> 00:16:53.480 align:start position:0%
absence I note um and you you certainly
 
00:16:55.350 --> 00:16:55.360 align:start position:0%
could put it in there it's not
 
00:16:58.990 --> 00:16:59.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely necessary the last section um
 
00:17:02.949 --> 00:17:02.959 align:start position:0%
section seven deals with um the parking
 
00:17:07.429 --> 00:17:07.439 align:start position:0%
requirements uh Park nationally um in in
 
00:17:10.069 --> 00:17:10.079 align:start position:0%
planning circles the the issue of
 
00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:12.520 align:start position:0%
parking and parking requirements has
 
00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:16.280 align:start position:0%
become a a really weighty discussion
 
00:17:19.630 --> 00:17:19.640 align:start position:0%
because of the difficulty that so many
 
00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:21.520 align:start position:0%
developments have in meeting local
 
00:17:24.029 --> 00:17:24.039 align:start position:0%
parking requirements and yet uh
 
00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:25.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities stand behind those
 
00:17:28.990 --> 00:17:29.000 align:start position:0%
standards so this is an opportunity for
 
00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:32.240 align:start position:0%
a uh developer to propose some sort of
 
00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:35.640 align:start position:0%
alternative uh that meets the standards
 
00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:38.840 align:start position:0%
but is not necessarily wholly on site
 
00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:40.880 align:start position:0%
and I think that that would be a welcome
 
00:17:44.549 --> 00:17:44.559 align:start position:0%
change to uh the uh the difficulties
 
00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
that uh developers have in meeting uh
 
00:17:48.669 --> 00:17:48.679 align:start position:0%
local parking
 
00:17:51.190 --> 00:17:51.200 align:start position:0%
requirements uh all that said uh New
 
00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:53.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire housing uh strongly supports
 
00:17:55.870 --> 00:17:55.880 align:start position:0%
this legislation urges you to recommend
 
00:17:58.029 --> 00:17:58.039 align:start position:0%
it ought to pass U we'd be happy to work
 
00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:00.840 align:start position:0%
with you on any amendments uh you wish
 
00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:03.520 align:start position:0%
and I'd be happy to take any
 
00:18:06.669 --> 00:18:06.679 align:start position:0%
questions representative Brown thank you
 
00:18:08.350 --> 00:18:08.360 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you for taking my
 
00:18:10.549 --> 00:18:10.559 align:start position:0%
question Mr Frost I have two quick
 
00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
questions so uh under U line 22 2324 it
 
00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:18.400 align:start position:0%
talks about the property tax page number
 
00:18:22.350 --> 00:18:22.360 align:start position:0%
uh f um first page um it talks about the
 
00:18:24.789 --> 00:18:24.799 align:start position:0%
property tax relief granted and it's
 
00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:27.280 align:start position:0%
once in a 20-year period so is there a
 
00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:29.480 align:start position:0%
limit on the amount of property tax that
 
00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:30.760 align:start position:0%
can be
 
00:18:33.909 --> 00:18:33.919 align:start position:0%
given relief representative this is a
 
00:18:36.549 --> 00:18:36.559 align:start position:0%
really good question it's not it's not
 
00:18:39.149 --> 00:18:39.159 align:start position:0%
the the amount of the tax there's no
 
00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:42.520 align:start position:0%
there's not a dollar number uh the way
 
00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:45.200 align:start position:0%
RSA 79e works and this is current law
 
00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:47.440 align:start position:0%
and has been since
 
00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:51.720 align:start position:0%
2006 um a a property owner where a
 
00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
municipality has adopted the provisions
 
00:18:57.549 --> 00:18:57.559 align:start position:0%
of the law will present to the local
 
00:18:59.630 --> 00:18:59.640 align:start position:0%
governing body uh the select board
 
00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:02.840 align:start position:0%
typically uh an application for use of
 
00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:06.760 align:start position:0%
79e in changing the use in the
 
00:19:08.590 --> 00:19:08.600 align:start position:0%
originally it was substantial
 
00:19:12.549 --> 00:19:12.559 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation and that was wherever a
 
00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:15.440 align:start position:0%
property owner was engaged in as defined
 
00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:16.430 align:start position:0%
property owner was engaged in as defined
substantial

00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:16.440 align:start position:0%
substantial
 
00:19:19.909 --> 00:19:19.919 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation and if the uh select
 
00:19:23.110 --> 00:19:23.120 align:start position:0%
board granted this then they would
 
00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
determine the time period of tax relief
 
00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:28.520 align:start position:0%
and the tax relief would take the form
 
00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:34.960 align:start position:0%
of of um of not taxing the increased
 
00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:37.440 align:start position:0%
valuation that's attributable to the
 
00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:41.000 align:start position:0%
change of use but rather T continuing to
 
00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:44.720 align:start position:0%
tax it on its pre pre-rehabilitation
 
00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:48.240 align:start position:0%
uh assessed valuation for a period of
 
00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:53.200 align:start position:0%
time um and and this this relies on the
 
00:19:56.510 --> 00:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
same structure so the base period tends
 
00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:00.280 align:start position:0%
to be 5 years although a municipality a
 
00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
select board may choose to do less than
 
00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:04.840 align:start position:0%
five if it wishes to there's a lot of
 
00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
flexibility in this law um but five
 
00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:09.760 align:start position:0%
years is the typical base period and
 
00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:13.480 align:start position:0%
then you add on uh additional things for
 
00:20:15.870 --> 00:20:15.880 align:start position:0%
uh provision of housing or if it's an
 
00:20:20.149 --> 00:20:20.159 align:start position:0%
historic structure um so ultimately you
 
00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:23.320 align:start position:0%
could get up to 13 14 or 15 years if you
 
00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:26.000 align:start position:0%
have the if you meet all of the the the
 
00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
levers that get pulled and the select
 
00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:30.080 align:start position:0%
board says yes to well of those the
 
00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:31.760 align:start position:0%
discretion really is wholly within the
 
00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
select board to decide how long but
 
00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:36.600 align:start position:0%
there's not a a specific dollar value
 
00:20:39.029 --> 00:20:39.039 align:start position:0%
okay thanks U Mr chairman quick followup
 
00:20:41.669 --> 00:20:41.679 align:start position:0%
go ahead so uh also in regard to the
 
00:20:44.909 --> 00:20:44.919 align:start position:0%
parking that you mentioned um today with
 
00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
the way people working remote some days
 
00:20:49.110 --> 00:20:49.120 align:start position:0%
of the week sometimes full-time uh
 
00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:52.360 align:start position:0%
remote um how do you determine the the
 
00:20:54.990 --> 00:20:55.000 align:start position:0%
parking requirement when you've got
 
00:20:56.590 --> 00:20:56.600 align:start position:0%
residential now some of these people
 
00:20:58.750 --> 00:20:58.760 align:start position:0%
could be working from home full-time
 
00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
some of the people could be just
 
00:21:02.430 --> 00:21:02.440 align:start position:0%
traveling and and it refers to hours of
 
00:21:04.029 --> 00:21:04.039 align:start position:0%
the day that you might have to have
 
00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:07.240 align:start position:0%
additional parking available thank you
 
00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:09.280 align:start position:0%
that's a great question and uh I would
 
00:21:10.909 --> 00:21:10.919 align:start position:0%
say that that the science is still
 
00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:13.080 align:start position:0%
trying to catch up with uh the actual
 
00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:16.640 align:start position:0%
patterns of use but I think that the
 
00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
current standards that many
 
00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
municipalities have are well in excess
 
00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:24.360 align:start position:0%
of what is actually needed irrespective
 
00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:27.440 align:start position:0%
of their actual use so even with with
 
00:21:29.950 --> 00:21:29.960 align:start position:0%
changes in remote work uh so that people
 
00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:33.000 align:start position:0%
are occupying commercial structures less
 
00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:36.400 align:start position:0%
occupying residential structures more um
 
00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
it you know the parking standards tend
 
00:21:40.549 --> 00:21:40.559 align:start position:0%
to be uh well in excess of what is
 
00:21:43.230 --> 00:21:43.240 align:start position:0%
required even with those changes uh I I
 
00:21:45.310 --> 00:21:45.320 align:start position:0%
will note that
 
00:21:49.149 --> 00:21:49.159 align:start position:0%
in um single family development most
 
00:21:51.269 --> 00:21:51.279 align:start position:0%
municipalities do not have specific
 
00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
parking standards uh that it's you know
 
00:21:55.909 --> 00:21:55.919 align:start position:0%
a single family home is expected to have
 
00:21:57.789 --> 00:21:57.799 align:start position:0%
adequate space for parking they don't
 
00:21:59.590 --> 00:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
they they regulate where the driveway
 
00:22:02.029 --> 00:22:02.039 align:start position:0%
will go but they don't say how much
 
00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
capacity that driveway is going to have
 
00:22:06.710 --> 00:22:06.720 align:start position:0%
for parking okay thank you very much
 
00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:07.909 align:start position:0%
for parking okay thank you very much
represent

00:22:07.909 --> 00:22:07.919 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
stavis thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:22:12.149 --> 00:22:12.159 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I just a
 
00:22:18.549 --> 00:22:18.559 align:start position:0%
definitions question on um page two line
 
00:22:23.029 --> 00:22:23.039 align:start position:0%
36 how under the um terms of this bill
 
00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:29.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:30.840 align:start position:0%
representative savis that's a great
 
00:22:33.630 --> 00:22:33.640 align:start position:0%
question it is one that uh we have been
 
00:22:36.110 --> 00:22:36.120 align:start position:0%
dealing with in other legislation this
 
00:22:39.390 --> 00:22:39.400 align:start position:0%
session uh specifically the uh the fire
 
00:22:43.230 --> 00:22:43.240 align:start position:0%
code and the building code so RSA 153
 
00:22:45.510 --> 00:22:45.520 align:start position:0%
and 155a
 
00:22:49.029 --> 00:22:49.039 align:start position:0%
respectively um generally uh
 
00:22:52.149 --> 00:22:52.159 align:start position:0%
non-transient occupancy is deemed to be
 
00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:54.720 align:start position:0%
uh either and I I I'm forgetting
 
00:22:56.590 --> 00:22:56.600 align:start position:0%
precisely how it's worded in both of
 
00:22:59.789 --> 00:22:59.799 align:start position:0%
those laws it's either more than 30 days
 
00:23:03.549 --> 00:23:03.559 align:start position:0%
or 30 days or more so it's 30 days is
 
00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:05.720 align:start position:0%
generally the the uh dividing line
 
00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:09.440 align:start position:0%
between Trent and non-rent
 
00:23:13.390 --> 00:23:13.400 align:start position:0%
occupancy follow up thank you Mr chair
 
00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:17.000 align:start position:0%
so given that continued work on the
 
00:23:21.230 --> 00:23:21.240 align:start position:0%
definition of this how would local
 
00:23:22.830 --> 00:23:22.840 align:start position:0%
government governments and planning
 
00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
board interpret
 
00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:28.520 align:start position:0%
this well in in the absence of a
 
00:23:30.549 --> 00:23:30.559 align:start position:0%
specific definition here I would refer
 
00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:38.029 --> 00:23:38.039 align:start position:0%
code further
 
00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:40.200 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
Ood thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:23:45.789 --> 00:23:45.799 align:start position:0%
taking my question this morning on page
 
00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
two starting at line three
 
00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:54.360 align:start position:0%
through line 10 I've run into this
 
00:23:57.390 --> 00:23:57.400 align:start position:0%
definition of local legislative body
 
00:24:00.549 --> 00:24:00.559 align:start position:0%
elsewhere in the the Planning and Zoning
 
00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
chapter and that they're saying
 
00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:07.120 align:start position:0%
following the basic forms of
 
00:24:11.350 --> 00:24:11.360 align:start position:0%
government um is not official ballot
 
00:24:15.870 --> 00:24:15.880 align:start position:0%
referenda a basic form of town
 
00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
government and would it not be included
 
00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
as an item
 
00:24:24.389 --> 00:24:24.399 align:start position:0%
G lowercase
 
00:24:28.870 --> 00:24:28.880 align:start position:0%
G in this list of types of form of
 
00:24:33.269 --> 00:24:33.279 align:start position:0%
government that's a great question and
 
00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:36.360 align:start position:0%
um I think the answer the appropriate
 
00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
answer is no because official ballot is
 
00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:41.840 align:start position:0%
not a form of government but a process
 
00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:43.230 align:start position:0%
not a form of government but a process
of

00:24:43.230 --> 00:24:43.240 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:24:48.149 --> 00:24:48.159 align:start position:0%
government uh and is addressed in other
 
00:24:52.470 --> 00:24:52.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:56.669 --> 00:24:56.679 align:start position:0%
you other questions for Mr Frost I see
 
00:24:57.870 --> 00:24:57.880 align:start position:0%
none thank you very much for your
 
00:24:57.880 --> 00:24:59.149 align:start position:0%
none thank you very much for your
testimony

00:24:59.149 --> 00:24:59.159 align:start position:0%

00:25:10.350 --> 00:25:10.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:14.080 align:start position:0%
Grace thank you Mr chair um I guess I'll
 
00:25:16.149 --> 00:25:16.159 align:start position:0%
answer specific uh n Grace for the
 
00:25:18.389 --> 00:25:18.399 align:start position:0%
municipal Association we do uh support
 
00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:20.960 align:start position:0%
this legislation um the committee had a
 
00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:23.200 align:start position:0%
number of specific questions that I will
 
00:25:25.470 --> 00:25:25.480 align:start position:0%
uh attempt to answer um representative
 
00:25:27.669 --> 00:25:27.679 align:start position:0%
power and Howland had some questions
 
00:25:29.190 --> 00:25:29.200 align:start position:0%
about um
 
00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:32.480 align:start position:0%
recision uh for the provisions related
 
00:25:37.230 --> 00:25:37.240 align:start position:0%
to um local option for the select board
 
00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:41.120 align:start position:0%
to uh to change
 
00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:44.480 align:start position:0%
zoning um while I do agree with with Mr
 
00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:47.360 align:start position:0%
Frost um I I will note as I'm sure
 
00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:48.840 align:start position:0%
representative power is aware that there
 
00:25:51.549 --> 00:25:51.559 align:start position:0%
are some statutes that have very
 
00:25:55.070 --> 00:25:55.080 align:start position:0%
specific um questions written out those
 
00:25:58.789 --> 00:25:58.799 align:start position:0%
include uh statutes like 404 Roman
 
00:26:03.950 --> 00:26:03.960 align:start position:0%
um seven uh as well and similar and then
 
00:26:05.710 --> 00:26:05.720 align:start position:0%
there are some that aren't so specific
 
00:26:09.070 --> 00:26:09.080 align:start position:0%
like 31 95b and which just basically say
 
00:26:12.909 --> 00:26:12.919 align:start position:0%
they can resend in the same manner um my
 
00:26:15.510 --> 00:26:15.520 align:start position:0%
I generally agree with Mr Frost that if
 
00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
there's no specific provision in the
 
00:26:19.909 --> 00:26:19.919 align:start position:0%
statutes you could just have another
 
00:26:21.669 --> 00:26:21.679 align:start position:0%
warrant article that would be voted on
 
00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:23.440 align:start position:0%
to resend to that
 
00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:25.110 align:start position:0%
to resend to that
power

00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:25.120 align:start position:0%
power
 
00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:28.640 align:start position:0%
um representative award um had a
 
00:26:32.029 --> 00:26:32.039 align:start position:0%
question about um the form of of
 
00:26:33.909 --> 00:26:33.919 align:start position:0%
government uh again I would agree with
 
00:26:38.310 --> 00:26:38.320 align:start position:0%
Mr Frost that um Bas in either the SP
 
00:26:43.070 --> 00:26:43.080 align:start position:0%
SP2 form or SP2 or non sb2 towns you'd
 
00:26:44.909 --> 00:26:44.919 align:start position:0%
still have it what is called a town
 
00:26:47.950 --> 00:26:47.960 align:start position:0%
meeting um I agree uh with
 
00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
representative Alward that that could be
 
00:26:54.350 --> 00:26:54.360 align:start position:0%
clarified um further but I'm not sure
 
00:26:56.549 --> 00:26:56.559 align:start position:0%
that's strictly
 
00:26:59.430 --> 00:26:59.440 align:start position:0%
necessary um representative Brown had a
 
00:27:02.669 --> 00:27:02.679 align:start position:0%
question about parking um and the use of
 
00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:06.520 align:start position:0%
that uh I would I would mention that I
 
00:27:12.430 --> 00:27:12.440 align:start position:0%
think that the uh the intent here um of
 
00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:16.120 align:start position:0%
the parking process is a better option
 
00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:18.720 align:start position:0%
than a strict mandate for the number of
 
00:27:21.669 --> 00:27:21.679 align:start position:0%
parking spots that may be allowed for
 
00:27:23.269 --> 00:27:23.279 align:start position:0%
any residential
 
00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:26.080 align:start position:0%
use uh and the reason for that is that
 
00:27:28.750 --> 00:27:28.760 align:start position:0%
we know that there are many scenar iOS
 
00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:31.360 align:start position:0%
where residential uses are not
 
00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:35.360 align:start position:0%
traditional um so they are you know in
 
00:27:37.669 --> 00:27:37.679 align:start position:0%
older areas of a municipality there may
 
00:27:40.389 --> 00:27:40.399 align:start position:0%
be very limited parking options newer
 
00:27:43.190 --> 00:27:43.200 align:start position:0%
they may have surface Lots they may have
 
00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:46.000 align:start position:0%
um you know mixed use Etc all of those
 
00:27:48.350 --> 00:27:48.360 align:start position:0%
will require different demands for
 
00:27:51.470 --> 00:27:51.480 align:start position:0%
parking um those are very specific uh
 
00:27:53.669 --> 00:27:53.679 align:start position:0%
and so rather than a uh legislative
 
00:27:58.430 --> 00:27:58.440 align:start position:0%
mandate from conquered a local uh local
 
00:28:00.430 --> 00:28:00.440 align:start position:0%
adopted Provisions that are tailored to
 
00:28:03.669 --> 00:28:03.679 align:start position:0%
the town make more sense um and in that
 
00:28:06.669 --> 00:28:06.679 align:start position:0%
case uh what is proposed here and the
 
00:28:09.950 --> 00:28:09.960 align:start position:0%
intent of what is proposed here is that
 
00:28:13.669 --> 00:28:13.679 align:start position:0%
that can still occur but um if the
 
00:28:16.350 --> 00:28:16.360 align:start position:0%
applicant says Hey the particular use
 
00:28:20.470 --> 00:28:20.480 align:start position:0%
that I'm proposing is in some way um
 
00:28:22.149 --> 00:28:22.159 align:start position:0%
going to be addressed by the number of
 
00:28:24.310 --> 00:28:24.320 align:start position:0%
parking spots I want to propose Which is
 
00:28:26.789 --> 00:28:26.799 align:start position:0%
less than the minimum and I can prove
 
00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:28.840 align:start position:0%
that then that has to be considered by
 
00:28:31.549 --> 00:28:31.559 align:start position:0%
the local board they have to weigh the
 
00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:33.360 align:start position:0%
evidence there they have the option of
 
00:28:36.789 --> 00:28:36.799 align:start position:0%
going to a a third party for review um
 
00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
and then the intent is although it's not
 
00:28:42.110 --> 00:28:42.120 align:start position:0%
expressly written out here that that
 
00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
third party review will help lead them
 
00:28:46.669 --> 00:28:46.679 align:start position:0%
to decide whether it is appropriate or
 
00:28:51.389 --> 00:28:51.399 align:start position:0%
not appropriate to um to uh grant that
 
00:28:53.509 --> 00:28:53.519 align:start position:0%
waiver of the minimum parking
 
00:28:55.549 --> 00:28:55.559 align:start position:0%
requirements and that's a I think that's
 
00:28:58.230 --> 00:28:58.240 align:start position:0%
a better option than any
 
00:29:00.269 --> 00:29:00.279 align:start position:0%
other policy options we might have
 
00:29:02.509 --> 00:29:02.519 align:start position:0%
because as Mr Frost said parking is very
 
00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:04.240 align:start position:0%
complicated and so it makes sense to
 
00:29:07.190 --> 00:29:07.200 align:start position:0%
tailor that to the specific municipality
 
00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
at the municipality level happy to take
 
00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:13.080 align:start position:0%
any questions that the committee may
 
00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
have representative
 
00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
power thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:29:20.149 --> 00:29:20.159 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question with regards
 
00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
to the type of development that's
 
00:29:27.789 --> 00:29:27.799 align:start position:0%
um the subject matter of section um two
 
00:29:31.190 --> 00:29:31.200 align:start position:0%
and and three and that is um office
 
00:29:33.230 --> 00:29:33.240 align:start position:0%
industrial or
 
00:29:36.789 --> 00:29:36.799 align:start position:0%
commercial is it true that this these
 
00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:39.200 align:start position:0%
types of development projects can
 
00:29:42.110 --> 00:29:42.120 align:start position:0%
already be done
 
00:29:47.389 --> 00:29:47.399 align:start position:0%
um right now with maybe um waivers from
 
00:29:50.909 --> 00:29:50.919 align:start position:0%
the zba and that of course the tax
 
00:29:53.230 --> 00:29:53.240 align:start position:0%
relief piece would not be
 
00:29:55.590 --> 00:29:55.600 align:start position:0%
there yes those development projects can
 
00:29:57.230 --> 00:29:57.240 align:start position:0%
already be done I think the only
 
00:29:58.990 --> 00:29:59.000 align:start position:0%
question is whe whether there can be a
 
00:30:00.870 --> 00:30:00.880 align:start position:0%
local tax relief incentive and that's
 
00:30:03.909 --> 00:30:03.919 align:start position:0%
the intent here um I'll note um as I'm
 
00:30:05.549 --> 00:30:05.559 align:start position:0%
sure you've noted representative power
 
00:30:08.509 --> 00:30:08.519 align:start position:0%
that um repeated in sections 2 and three
 
00:30:11.190 --> 00:30:11.200 align:start position:0%
it says office use I think the intent is
 
00:30:13.509 --> 00:30:13.519 align:start position:0%
to incorporate what's in section A which
 
00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:15.440 align:start position:0%
is office industrial or commercial and
 
00:30:19.389 --> 00:30:19.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:21.430 --> 00:30:21.440 align:start position:0%
oversight represent
 
00:30:23.789 --> 00:30:23.799 align:start position:0%
majori thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:30:27.070 --> 00:30:27.080 align:start position:0%
for taking my question Mr Grace um I
 
00:30:30.110 --> 00:30:30.120 align:start position:0%
I've heard now a couple of times um with
 
00:30:31.630 --> 00:30:31.640 align:start position:0%
the parking requirements and I'm going
 
00:30:34.750 --> 00:30:34.760 align:start position:0%
to page three and I'm going to line
 
00:30:37.870 --> 00:30:37.880 align:start position:0%
25 uh that if the applicant can uh
 
00:30:40.070 --> 00:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
demonstrate that he has a solution that
 
00:30:42.310 --> 00:30:42.320 align:start position:0%
the that the planning board should
 
00:30:44.269 --> 00:30:44.279 align:start position:0%
consider that
 
00:30:46.590 --> 00:30:46.600 align:start position:0%
solution am I correct that the language
 
00:30:49.310 --> 00:30:49.320 align:start position:0%
says that the planning board shall
 
00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:54.720 align:start position:0%
accept and approve or shall approve the
 
00:30:57.350 --> 00:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
alternate yes so that if the applicant
 
00:31:01.149 --> 00:31:01.159 align:start position:0%
demonstrates that the alternate is um
 
00:31:04.669 --> 00:31:04.679 align:start position:0%
the a VI is the viable solution then the
 
00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:08.240 align:start position:0%
planning board has to has to cons has to
 
00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
agree and adopt that and would it would
 
00:31:15.149 --> 00:31:15.159 align:start position:0%
be a mandatory waiver of the minimum
 
00:31:17.470 --> 00:31:17.480 align:start position:0%
M further
 
00:31:22.070 --> 00:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:33.789 --> 00:31:33.799 align:start position:0%

here it's what's preventing them from
 
00:31:56.830 --> 00:31:56.840 align:start position:0%
staying here it's what's preventing them
 
00:31:58.549 --> 00:31:58.559 align:start position:0%
from moving here
 
00:32:01.389 --> 00:32:01.399 align:start position:0%

not affordable enough so as such you

issue contributing to the cost of living
 
00:32:44.190 --> 00:32:44.200 align:start position:0%
challenges for young people here in New
 
00:32:45.990 --> 00:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire which we desperately need
 
00:32:48.590 --> 00:32:48.600 align:start position:0%
which our employers need which our
 
00:32:50.430 --> 00:32:50.440 align:start position:0%
cities and towns need which our
 
00:32:52.230 --> 00:32:52.240 align:start position:0%
nonprofits need to do all the work that
 
00:32:55.430 --> 00:32:55.440 align:start position:0%
we need done here in New Hampshire thank
 
00:33:01.070 --> 00:33:01.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:02.590 --> 00:33:02.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:33:05.789 --> 00:33:05.799 align:start position:0%
taking my question um looking at the
 
00:33:08.590 --> 00:33:08.600 align:start position:0%
sections that discuss the tax relief in
 
00:33:11.350 --> 00:33:11.360 align:start position:0%
incentive so of course
 
00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:14.880 align:start position:0%
initially the the cost for such housing
 
00:33:19.029 --> 00:33:19.039 align:start position:0%
will be at a certain price point then
 
00:33:22.509 --> 00:33:22.519 align:start position:0%
later in the future when these tax
 
00:33:22.519 --> 00:33:24.750 align:start position:0%
later in the future when these tax
reliefs

00:33:24.750 --> 00:33:24.760 align:start position:0%
reliefs
 
00:33:27.509 --> 00:33:27.519 align:start position:0%
expire what what's going to happen to
 
00:33:27.519 --> 00:33:28.310 align:start position:0%
expire what what's going to happen to
the

00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:33:32.110 --> 00:33:32.120 align:start position:0%
the the cost for such housing now that
 
00:33:33.509 --> 00:33:33.519 align:start position:0%
the the
 
00:33:37.629 --> 00:33:37.639 align:start position:0%
tax the taxable property is is going to
 
00:33:40.149 --> 00:33:40.159 align:start position:0%
be increased so there's going to
 
00:33:43.389 --> 00:33:43.399 align:start position:0%
be you understand my question sure and
 
00:33:45.950 --> 00:33:45.960 align:start position:0%
I'll caveat my response by saying that
 
00:33:48.350 --> 00:33:48.360 align:start position:0%
uh at stay work play you know we are not
 
00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:51.360 align:start position:0%

hearing from me I uh I'm in we're ahead
 
00:35:33.550 --> 00:35:33.560 align:start position:0%
is in support of um this bill think it
 
00:35:35.109 --> 00:35:35.119 align:start position:0%
brings a lot of great things to the
 
00:35:38.710 --> 00:35:38.720 align:start position:0%
table um I I cannot speak as eloquently
 
00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
or technically to it as uh those who
 
00:35:42.589 --> 00:35:42.599 align:start position:0%
already have so I will try to keep my
 
00:35:42.599 --> 00:35:43.630 align:start position:0%
already have so I will try to keep my
piece

00:35:43.630 --> 00:35:43.640 align:start position:0%
piece
 
00:35:47.310 --> 00:35:47.320 align:start position:0%
brief um we use 790 a lot of the
 
00:35:50.030 --> 00:35:50.040 align:start position:0%
communities in the North Country rely on
 
00:35:53.430 --> 00:35:53.440 align:start position:0%
790 um you know we look at work we're
 
00:35:55.829 --> 00:35:55.839 align:start position:0%
doing in Whitefield in Berlin uh
 
00:35:58.829 --> 00:35:58.839 align:start position:0%
Lancaster colbrook these are all towns
 
00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:01.440 align:start position:0%
that uh previously had quite a lot of
 
00:36:03.510 --> 00:36:03.520 align:start position:0%
economic uh commercial industrial
 
00:36:06.150 --> 00:36:06.160 align:start position:0%
activity and no longer do and some of
 
00:36:07.589 --> 00:36:07.599 align:start position:0%
those buildings are starting to turn to
 
00:36:10.230 --> 00:36:10.240 align:start position:0%
blight this is an opportunity for those
 
00:36:11.910 --> 00:36:11.920 align:start position:0%
communities to see those buildings
 
00:36:14.870 --> 00:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
repurposed and reused um to the needs of
 
00:36:17.550 --> 00:36:17.560 align:start position:0%
the community so uh we we already make
 
00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:19.520 align:start position:0%
use of it we work in municipalities who
 
00:36:22.150 --> 00:36:22.160 align:start position:0%
do and this gives them even more even
 
00:36:24.349 --> 00:36:24.359 align:start position:0%
more leeway as far as whether or not
 
00:36:26.829 --> 00:36:26.839 align:start position:0%
they want to adopt it um to give us an
 
00:36:29.829 --> 00:36:29.839 align:start position:0%
incentive to come in and work with them
 
00:36:33.550 --> 00:36:33.560 align:start position:0%
um an another piece that obviously uh is
 
00:36:37.430 --> 00:36:37.440 align:start position:0%
is great is the the parking piece and I
 
00:36:40.030 --> 00:36:40.040 align:start position:0%
will actually come with uh my experience
 
00:36:41.630 --> 00:36:41.640 align:start position:0%
I was previously the executive director
 
00:36:44.069 --> 00:36:44.079 align:start position:0%
for um Mount Washington Valley Housing
 
00:36:46.589 --> 00:36:46.599 align:start position:0%
Coalition and I worked with a lot of
 
00:36:48.150 --> 00:36:48.160 align:start position:0%
planning boards throughout the Mount
 
00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
Washington Valley working on their codes
 
00:36:52.790 --> 00:36:52.800 align:start position:0%
and updating them and I think another
 
00:36:55.349 --> 00:36:55.359 align:start position:0%
piece that we often forget about is that
 
00:36:58.430 --> 00:36:58.440 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of our um zoning boards
 
00:37:00.829 --> 00:37:00.839 align:start position:0%
especially in our rural communities are
 
00:37:03.309 --> 00:37:03.319 align:start position:0%
completely volunteers um they are not
 
00:37:05.230 --> 00:37:05.240 align:start position:0%
trained in planning they are not trained
 
00:37:08.950 --> 00:37:08.960 align:start position:0%
in zoning um and they struggle to find
 
00:37:10.950 --> 00:37:10.960 align:start position:0%
out what they can do to best help and
 
00:37:13.069 --> 00:37:13.079 align:start position:0%
serve their communities and a lot of
 
00:37:15.470 --> 00:37:15.480 align:start position:0%
them just need to know a place to start
 
00:37:17.270 --> 00:37:17.280 align:start position:0%
and so legislation like this can help
 
00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:19.040 align:start position:0%
Point them in their efforts in the right
 
00:37:20.710 --> 00:37:20.720 align:start position:0%
direction to say we have highlighted
 
00:37:23.150 --> 00:37:23.160 align:start position:0%
parking as being a huge issue and now
 
00:37:26.030 --> 00:37:26.040 align:start position:0%
you can uh augment Your Capacity by
 
00:37:27.710 --> 00:37:27.720 align:start position:0%
having different groups bring
 
00:37:30.109 --> 00:37:30.119 align:start position:0%
alternative parking proposals to you so
 
00:37:31.829 --> 00:37:31.839 align:start position:0%
that you can look at what works for your
 
00:37:33.750 --> 00:37:33.760 align:start position:0%
community based on those proposals and
 
00:37:36.309 --> 00:37:36.319 align:start position:0%
make adequate changes um that are going
 
00:37:37.950 --> 00:37:37.960 align:start position:0%
to help better serve your communities in
 
00:37:39.990 --> 00:37:40.000 align:start position:0%
the long run so I think that's an an
 
00:37:43.390 --> 00:37:43.400 align:start position:0%
added bonus again for a lot of our rural
 
00:37:46.109 --> 00:37:46.119 align:start position:0%
communities um
 
00:37:49.309 --> 00:37:49.319 align:start position:0%
lastly um lastly I just talk about the
 
00:37:52.750 --> 00:37:52.760 align:start position:0%
um increased ability for select boards
 
00:37:54.069 --> 00:37:54.079 align:start position:0%
um I did also just serve as a
 
00:37:55.950 --> 00:37:55.960 align:start position:0%
commissioner on Conway's Town Charter
 
00:37:58.870 --> 00:37:58.880 align:start position:0%
commission um we got over 50% but didn't
 
00:38:02.190 --> 00:38:02.200 align:start position:0%
hit 60% unfortunately and um one of the
 
00:38:03.910 --> 00:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
things that we were looking at is the
 
00:38:06.710 --> 00:38:06.720 align:start position:0%
limited ability of our select board um
 
00:38:08.829 --> 00:38:08.839 align:start position:0%
Conway has an immense amount of
 
00:38:10.670 --> 00:38:10.680 align:start position:0%
development going on right now and one
 
00:38:12.150 --> 00:38:12.160 align:start position:0%
of the things we were considering was
 
00:38:13.910 --> 00:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
that we would have to completely change
 
00:38:15.910 --> 00:38:15.920 align:start position:0%
our Charter to a Town Council in order
 
00:38:18.910 --> 00:38:18.920 align:start position:0%
to give the council then an ability to
 
00:38:21.790 --> 00:38:21.800 align:start position:0%
act um in more than a regular annual
 
00:38:23.550 --> 00:38:23.560 align:start position:0%
fashion on getting any sort of zoning
 
00:38:27.470 --> 00:38:27.480 align:start position:0%
changes done um so we uh unfortunately
 
00:38:28.670 --> 00:38:28.680 align:start position:0%
weren't able to get that because there
 
00:38:30.870 --> 00:38:30.880 align:start position:0%
was a lot of con concern generally about
 
00:38:32.510 --> 00:38:32.520 align:start position:0%
going to a Town Council and sort of a
 
00:38:34.589 --> 00:38:34.599 align:start position:0%
select board but being able to maintain
 
00:38:36.670 --> 00:38:36.680 align:start position:0%
our select board and sb2 form of
 
00:38:38.270 --> 00:38:38.280 align:start position:0%
government while still being able to
 
00:38:40.750 --> 00:38:40.760 align:start position:0%
increase the abilities of the select
 
00:38:43.270 --> 00:38:43.280 align:start position:0%
board would be an added advantage to
 
00:38:45.630 --> 00:38:45.640 align:start position:0%
many communities in the state because I
 
00:38:48.430 --> 00:38:48.440 align:start position:0%
I believe from a presentation actually
 
00:38:50.990 --> 00:38:51.000 align:start position:0%
given by uh Mr Grace that I I believe
 
00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
the select board is the number one uh
 
00:38:55.430 --> 00:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
form of government in the state of New
 
00:38:56.750 --> 00:38:56.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so there are many
 
00:38:58.230 --> 00:38:58.240 align:start position:0%
municipalities who would be able to take
 
00:39:02.069 --> 00:39:02.079 align:start position:0%
advantage of that um so again fully
 
00:39:04.430 --> 00:39:04.440 align:start position:0%
support this um happy to answer any
 
00:39:05.990 --> 00:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
questions that I can and thank you for
 
00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:06.910 align:start position:0%
questions that I can and thank you for
your

00:39:06.910 --> 00:39:06.920 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:39:09.190 --> 00:39:09.200 align:start position:0%
time thank you forther questions
 
00:39:11.430 --> 00:39:11.440 align:start position:0%
representative power thank you Mr
 
00:39:12.829 --> 00:39:12.839 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
00:39:14.829 --> 00:39:14.839 align:start position:0%
question so I'm I'm going to go back to
 
00:39:16.270 --> 00:39:16.280 align:start position:0%
the question that I asked the prime
 
00:39:19.390 --> 00:39:19.400 align:start position:0%
sponsor with regards to the involvement
 
00:39:22.750 --> 00:39:22.760 align:start position:0%
of the planning board in just that cycle
 
00:39:27.390 --> 00:39:27.400 align:start position:0%
of researching and you know wording or
 
00:39:31.030 --> 00:39:31.040 align:start position:0%
zoning ordinances and and
 
00:39:34.870 --> 00:39:34.880 align:start position:0%
such I I'm hearing testimony that this
 
00:39:36.670 --> 00:39:36.680 align:start position:0%
part of the bill that provision is going
 
00:39:39.710 --> 00:39:39.720 align:start position:0%
to enable more frequent
 
00:39:41.750 --> 00:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
adoption of
 
00:39:44.069 --> 00:39:44.079 align:start position:0%
ordinances but yet at the same time I
 
00:39:47.270 --> 00:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
still see that natural cycle that
 
00:39:50.390 --> 00:39:50.400 align:start position:0%
natural I guess you know process by
 
00:39:51.790 --> 00:39:51.800 align:start position:0%
which the planning board is going to
 
00:39:54.829 --> 00:39:54.839 align:start position:0%
engage in so while I hear on one hand
 
00:39:57.910 --> 00:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
what um people are saying in testimony
 
00:40:00.030 --> 00:40:00.040 align:start position:0%
as to why this provision in the bill is
 
00:40:02.069 --> 00:40:02.079 align:start position:0%
good I'm just there's some disconnect
 
00:40:04.790 --> 00:40:04.800 align:start position:0%
can you help me to to understand that um
 
00:40:07.270 --> 00:40:07.280 align:start position:0%
I again I can't speak to it probably as
 
00:40:08.950 --> 00:40:08.960 align:start position:0%
technically as others but the way I
 
00:40:10.510 --> 00:40:10.520 align:start position:0%
would Envision it is a kind of a
 
00:40:12.670 --> 00:40:12.680 align:start position:0%
systemic shift so the reason that the
 
00:40:14.990 --> 00:40:15.000 align:start position:0%
planning boards operate kind of on the
 
00:40:16.750 --> 00:40:16.760 align:start position:0%
timeline they do presently in
 
00:40:18.430 --> 00:40:18.440 align:start position:0%
communities where they just have an
 
00:40:20.430 --> 00:40:20.440 align:start position:0%
annual meeting is because they just have
 
00:40:22.510 --> 00:40:22.520 align:start position:0%
the annual meeting so as a result they
 
00:40:24.790 --> 00:40:24.800 align:start position:0%
have to kind of be studying researching
 
00:40:27.670 --> 00:40:27.680 align:start position:0%
preparing for that one given date um if
 
00:40:30.069 --> 00:40:30.079 align:start position:0%
you then have a new system wherein they
 
00:40:33.069 --> 00:40:33.079 align:start position:0%
can be essentially doing that throughout
 
00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
the entire year knowing that when it
 
00:40:36.829 --> 00:40:36.839 align:start position:0%
hits the next body after they've
 
00:40:38.550 --> 00:40:38.560 align:start position:0%
approved it they support it and they
 
00:40:40.349 --> 00:40:40.359 align:start position:0%
want to move it forward and it can then
 
00:40:42.750 --> 00:40:42.760 align:start position:0%
go to the next board and they can after

Employers in your districts uh they
 
00:42:16.230 --> 00:42:16.240 align:start position:0%
would tell you that housing has a direct
 
00:42:19.150 --> 00:42:19.160 align:start position:0%
impact on their ability to hire people
 
00:42:22.109 --> 00:42:22.119 align:start position:0%
and retain workers and Workforce
 
00:42:25.109 --> 00:42:25.119 align:start position:0%

00:42:27.230 --> 00:42:27.240 align:start position:0%
employer concern in New Hampshire now
 
00:42:29.430 --> 00:42:29.440 align:start position:0%

01:04:10.710 --> 01:04:10.720 align:start position:0%
involved in the loop of this so Senate
 
01:04:14.470 --> 01:04:14.480 align:start position:0%
Bill 448 FN as amended establishes the
 
01:04:16.750 --> 01:04:16.760 align:start position:0%
Woodsville fire district as a village
 
01:04:18.990 --> 01:04:19.000 align:start position:0%
district with all rights duties and
 
01:04:21.309 --> 01:04:21.319 align:start position:0%
obligations of such a district governed
 
01:04:26.109 --> 01:04:26.119 align:start position:0%
by RSA 52 due to continued division over
 
01:04:28.630 --> 01:04:28.640 align:start position:0%
finances between Woodsville and hail a
 
01:04:31.630 --> 01:04:31.640 align:start position:0%
contingency formula has been created
 
01:04:33.710 --> 01:04:33.720 align:start position:0%
this formula will be used to calculate
 
01:04:36.190 --> 01:04:36.200 align:start position:0%
reimbursement of Woodsville for taxes
 
01:04:39.109 --> 01:04:39.119 align:start position:0%
collected by havil the passage of this
 
01:04:41.029 --> 01:04:41.039 align:start position:0%
legislation will provide improved
 
01:04:43.269 --> 01:04:43.279 align:start position:0%
Clarity of procedures for both The
 
01:04:46.750 --> 01:04:46.760 align:start position:0%
Village district and the town so
 
01:04:48.990 --> 01:04:49.000 align:start position:0%
basically what Senator gray wanted to
 
01:04:53.109 --> 01:04:53.119 align:start position:0%
set up was something that neither side
 
01:04:56.470 --> 01:04:56.480 align:start position:0%
necessarily totally won or totally lost
 
01:04:59.309 --> 01:04:59.319 align:start position:0%
he wanted to set it up so it was a 5050
 
01:05:02.750 --> 01:05:02.760 align:start position:0%
win um he did go to the town of
 
01:05:04.950 --> 01:05:04.960 align:start position:0%
Woodsville hayil to meet with both
 
01:05:08.430 --> 01:05:08.440 align:start position:0%
groups and he's kind of left it where he
 
01:05:10.910 --> 01:05:10.920 align:start position:0%
would like for them to sit down come to
 
01:05:12.750 --> 01:05:12.760 align:start position:0%
an agreement because it really shouldn't
 
01:05:15.910 --> 01:05:15.920 align:start position:0%
be the legislature that determines the
 
01:05:19.109 --> 01:05:19.119 align:start position:0%
outcome of this so this is where it's at
 
01:05:22.230 --> 01:05:22.240 align:start position:0%
now if it sounds like a mess it it
 
01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:23.510 align:start position:0%
now if it sounds like a mess it it
probably

01:05:23.510 --> 01:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
probably
 
01:05:26.430 --> 01:05:26.440 align:start position:0%
is so um I do thank you for your
 
01:05:28.710 --> 01:05:28.720 align:start position:0%
consideration for o for ought to pass
 
01:05:31.910 --> 01:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
for Senate Bill 448 FN I know there are
 
01:05:34.510 --> 01:05:34.520 align:start position:0%
people here that will testify I do have
 
01:05:36.829 --> 01:05:36.839 align:start position:0%
to get back to my committee but I'm
 
01:05:40.230 --> 01:05:40.240 align:start position:0%
happy to take um any
 
01:05:42.109 --> 01:05:42.119 align:start position:0%
questions thank for Testimony
 
01:05:44.269 --> 01:05:44.279 align:start position:0%
representative power thank you Mr
 
01:05:45.910 --> 01:05:45.920 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
01:05:45.920 --> 01:05:48.269 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
question

01:05:48.269 --> 01:05:48.279 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:05:51.230 --> 01:05:51.240 align:start position:0%
Senator as as You' stated this is a very
 
01:05:54.190 --> 01:05:54.200 align:start position:0%
complex issue and and I understand what
 
01:05:57.269 --> 01:05:57.279 align:start position:0%
the bill seeks to do but for me in order
 
01:06:00.309 --> 01:06:00.319 align:start position:0%
to make um a
 
01:06:02.950 --> 01:06:02.960 align:start position:0%
just decision with regarding this
 
01:06:05.470 --> 01:06:05.480 align:start position:0%
legislation it's important for me to
 
01:06:07.950 --> 01:06:07.960 align:start position:0%
understand you know the foundational the
 
01:06:10.349 --> 01:06:10.359 align:start position:0%
basics and I'm I'm very confused I did I
 
01:06:12.670 --> 01:06:12.680 align:start position:0%
did a lot of research there's a lot of
 
01:06:16.150 --> 01:06:16.160 align:start position:0%
information out there and I was trying
 
01:06:20.269 --> 01:06:20.279 align:start position:0%
to understand first and foremost you're
 
01:06:22.510 --> 01:06:22.520 align:start position:0%
the subject of this legislation is the
 
01:06:25.109 --> 01:06:25.119 align:start position:0%
Woodsville fire district yet in my
 
01:06:27.470 --> 01:06:27.480 align:start position:0%
research so I understand what a fire
 
01:06:30.309 --> 01:06:30.319 align:start position:0%
district is to to me it it's a village
 
01:06:32.349 --> 01:06:32.359 align:start position:0%
District that was established for the
 
01:06:37.829 --> 01:06:37.839 align:start position:0%
purpose of um dealing with um fire
 
01:06:40.109 --> 01:06:40.119 align:start position:0%
concerns but I heard you say in your
 
01:06:42.670 --> 01:06:42.680 align:start position:0%
testimony that the town of
 
01:06:47.349 --> 01:06:47.359 align:start position:0%
Woodsville and I've also heard ascertain
 
01:06:49.870 --> 01:06:49.880 align:start position:0%
that that type of a I guess a a
 
01:06:52.829 --> 01:06:52.839 align:start position:0%
mentality with regarding to Woodsville
 
01:06:55.630 --> 01:06:55.640 align:start position:0%
fire district or Woodsville Village or
 
01:06:58.150 --> 01:06:58.160 align:start position:0%
whatever you want to call it is is it a
 
01:07:00.630 --> 01:07:00.640 align:start position:0%
town is is it a village district and
 
01:07:02.950 --> 01:07:02.960 align:start position:0%
that's confusing to me because to me I
 
01:07:05.029 --> 01:07:05.039 align:start position:0%
see Woodsville fire district and I even
 
01:07:07.789 --> 01:07:07.799 align:start position:0%
went and and did research and obtained
 
01:07:07.799 --> 01:07:09.150 align:start position:0%
went and and did research and obtained
the

01:07:09.150 --> 01:07:09.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:07:13.390 --> 01:07:13.400 align:start position:0%
um the statute the the laws from 1899
 
01:07:15.910 --> 01:07:15.920 align:start position:0%
and I think it was
 
01:07:19.549 --> 01:07:19.559 align:start position:0%
1913 trying to understand what is
 
01:07:21.630 --> 01:07:21.640 align:start position:0%
Woodsville can can you help me to
 
01:07:23.870 --> 01:07:23.880 align:start position:0%
understand that
 
01:07:26.069 --> 01:07:26.079 align:start position:0%
hopefully and if I can and I know there
 
01:07:28.670 --> 01:07:28.680 align:start position:0%
are people here that that can there are
 
01:07:31.829 --> 01:07:31.839 align:start position:0%
four precincts or Village districts in
 
01:07:34.789 --> 01:07:34.799 align:start position:0%
the town of hail and it was described to
 
01:07:37.349 --> 01:07:37.359 align:start position:0%
me it's it's like you've got a a sheet
 
01:07:39.789 --> 01:07:39.799 align:start position:0%
of paper and on top of it you've got
 
01:07:43.150 --> 01:07:43.160 align:start position:0%
four Post-it notes the the paper itself
 
01:07:46.150 --> 01:07:46.160 align:start position:0%
is the township of havil but the Post-it
 
01:07:48.910 --> 01:07:48.920 align:start position:0%
notes are the precincts well Woodsville
 
01:07:50.470 --> 01:07:50.480 align:start position:0%
is one of those
 
01:07:53.829 --> 01:07:53.839 align:start position:0%
precincts and and to their credit they I
 
01:07:55.630 --> 01:07:55.640 align:start position:0%
would have to say that they are the
 
01:08:00.150 --> 01:08:00.160 align:start position:0%
business Hub of havil there's Walmarts
 
01:08:02.510 --> 01:08:02.520 align:start position:0%
there there are a lot of restaurants a
 
01:08:05.430 --> 01:08:05.440 align:start position:0%
lot of businesses that are and back in
 
01:08:07.109 --> 01:08:07.119 align:start position:0%
the day when the railroad was going
 
01:08:10.150 --> 01:08:10.160 align:start position:0%
through that was the place to go so I
 
01:08:13.269 --> 01:08:13.279 align:start position:0%
understand you know the them wanting to
 
01:08:16.910 --> 01:08:16.920 align:start position:0%
um preserve that and as as they should
 
01:08:19.229 --> 01:08:19.239 align:start position:0%
because they are the the business Hub if
 
01:08:20.749 --> 01:08:20.759 align:start position:0%
you had to look at it in the the
 
01:08:22.749 --> 01:08:22.759 align:start position:0%
entirety of of
 
01:08:25.590 --> 01:08:25.600 align:start position:0%
hail I don't know if that I'm starting
 
01:08:27.910 --> 01:08:27.920 align:start position:0%
to answer your question or not but it's
 
01:08:29.349 --> 01:08:29.359 align:start position:0%
that's why I say it's it is very
 
01:08:31.309 --> 01:08:31.319 align:start position:0%
confusing it's not they're they're not a
 
01:08:33.829 --> 01:08:33.839 align:start position:0%
town hail is the town but they are a
 
01:08:35.950 --> 01:08:35.960 align:start position:0%
village District or
 
01:08:37.590 --> 01:08:37.600 align:start position:0%
Precinct go
 
01:08:39.749 --> 01:08:39.759 align:start position:0%
ahead thank you Mr chairman I just have
 
01:08:42.709 --> 01:08:42.719 align:start position:0%

01:08:44.870 --> 01:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
in your in your bill introduction that
 
01:08:46.910 --> 01:08:46.920 align:start position:0%
part of this bill is to establish
 
01:08:49.070 --> 01:08:49.080 align:start position:0%
Woodsville fire district as a village
 
01:08:52.070 --> 01:08:52.080 align:start position:0%

01:08:54.390 --> 01:08:54.400 align:start position:0%

01:08:55.990 --> 01:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
of it is the finan

ruination well whatever getting money
 
01:09:03.269 --> 01:09:03.279 align:start position:0%
back so it's um that was part of the
 
01:09:07.630 --> 01:09:07.640 align:start position:0%
concern was the um and and again I'm not
 
01:09:12.590 --> 01:09:12.600 align:start position:0%
sure I fully comprehend the formula um I
 
01:09:16.430 --> 01:09:16.440 align:start position:0%

uh past notes about uh previous bills
 
01:10:26.310 --> 01:10:26.320 align:start position:0%
relating to to the whole Woodsville
 
01:10:28.790 --> 01:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
situation that we've heard while I've
 
01:10:33.910 --> 01:10:33.920 align:start position:0%
while I was here um first was sb26 in uh
 
01:10:36.990 --> 01:10:37.000 align:start position:0%
2021 which was through Public Works and
 
01:10:41.510 --> 01:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
Highway which um modified
 
01:10:45.149 --> 01:10:45.159 align:start position:0%
um the I see there's also Highway
 
01:10:48.310 --> 01:10:48.320 align:start position:0%
portion in this build too and then um
 
01:10:51.510 --> 01:10:51.520 align:start position:0%
and then there was also s SP 239 in
 
01:10:55.750 --> 01:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
2022 which had to do um with
 
01:11:00.709 --> 01:11:00.719 align:start position:0%
audit requirements so um does this
 
01:11:00.719 --> 01:11:02.950 align:start position:0%
audit requirements so um does this
bill

01:11:02.950 --> 01:11:02.960 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:11:05.630 --> 01:11:05.640 align:start position:0%
um how how does this bill relate to
 
01:11:07.750 --> 01:11:07.760 align:start position:0%
those previous pieces of legislation
 
01:11:09.430 --> 01:11:09.440 align:start position:0%
does it
 
01:11:14.750 --> 01:11:14.760 align:start position:0%
um does it undo or go um the previous
 
01:11:19.030 --> 01:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
bills or go farther in those directions
 
01:11:23.149 --> 01:11:23.159 align:start position:0%
or um yeah how does it relate that's a
 
01:11:25.070 --> 01:11:25.080 align:start position:0%
that's a good question um couple good
 
01:11:26.950 --> 01:11:26.960 align:start position:0%
question questions there if this this
 
01:11:29.950 --> 01:11:29.960 align:start position:0%
bill is to make it fair and Equitable
 
01:11:33.430 --> 01:11:33.440 align:start position:0%
for both the precinct and the
 
01:11:37.310 --> 01:11:37.320 align:start position:0%
town that was the intention of
 
01:11:40.310 --> 01:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
it so does it eliminate both of the
 
01:11:44.270 --> 01:11:44.280 align:start position:0%
other bills no the the intention is
 
01:11:48.870 --> 01:11:48.880 align:start position:0%
that Senator gray um wanted to make sure
 
01:11:52.310 --> 01:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
that with this bill that it was the last

01:12:29.110 --> 01:12:29.120 align:start position:0%
Woodsville being just one of them the
 
01:12:32.709 --> 01:12:32.719 align:start position:0%
other three precincts are they
 
01:12:36.070 --> 01:12:36.080 align:start position:0%
established already to the way that
 
01:12:39.270 --> 01:12:39.280 align:start position:0%
Woodsville wants to be or are they kind
 
01:12:41.910 --> 01:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
of just hanging out there they have um
 
01:12:43.629 --> 01:12:43.639 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean they're established and
 
01:12:45.350 --> 01:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
they're they're hanging out one one
 
01:12:47.030 --> 01:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
other Precinct is called the Mountain
 
01:12:50.629 --> 01:12:50.639 align:start position:0%
Lakes um Precinct uh which it's like a
 
01:12:52.870 --> 01:12:52.880 align:start position:0%
resort well people live there year round
 
01:12:55.629 --> 01:12:55.639 align:start position:0%
but they have their own little um uh
 
01:12:58.550 --> 01:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
there's a lake there and but they they
 
01:13:01.590 --> 01:13:01.600 align:start position:0%
are an established Precinct as well as
 
01:13:04.110 --> 01:13:04.120 align:start position:0%
Pike and I believe it's havil corner is
 
01:13:07.030 --> 01:13:07.040 align:start position:0%
the the third so Woodsville and and
 
01:13:08.790 --> 01:13:08.800 align:start position:0%
again going back to credit for
 
01:13:11.950 --> 01:13:11.960 align:start position:0%
Woodsville they are probably the
 
01:13:16.390 --> 01:13:16.400 align:start position:0%
business Hub of the township of havil
 
01:13:19.629 --> 01:13:19.639 align:start position:0%

01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:25.830 align:start position:0%
hail itself does it have fire protection
yes

01:13:25.830 --> 01:13:25.840 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:13:29.709 --> 01:13:29.719 align:start position:0%
and currently is there responsibility
 
01:13:31.510 --> 01:13:31.520 align:start position:0%
the entire
 
01:13:35.110 --> 01:13:35.120 align:start position:0%
town for the right correct correct and
 
01:13:37.590 --> 01:13:37.600 align:start position:0%
Woodsville is responsible for their
 
01:13:39.669 --> 01:13:39.679 align:start position:0%
eight miles now I could stand corrected
 
01:13:41.750 --> 01:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
on this because I'm not sure of all the
 
01:13:44.149 --> 01:13:44.159 align:start position:0%
intricacies because I do know Woodsville
 
01:13:47.470 --> 01:13:47.480 align:start position:0%
has eight miles of road that they're
 
01:13:47.480 --> 01:13:48.830 align:start position:0%
has eight miles of road that they're
responsible

01:13:48.830 --> 01:13:48.840 align:start position:0%
responsible
 
01:13:51.990 --> 01:13:52.000 align:start position:0%
for thank you representative
 
01:13:54.189 --> 01:13:54.199 align:start position:0%
savis thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:13:57.310 --> 01:13:57.320 align:start position:0%
senator for taking my question um I'm
 
01:14:00.189 --> 01:14:00.199 align:start position:0%
intrigued by what you said about um
 
01:14:02.270 --> 01:14:02.280 align:start position:0%
Senator gray I think his intention to
 
01:14:05.350 --> 01:14:05.360 align:start position:0%
have this be the last bill that comes
 
01:14:07.709 --> 01:14:07.719 align:start position:0%
before the legislature on this topic but
 
01:14:10.350 --> 01:14:10.360 align:start position:0%
yet this committee gets bills in every
 
01:14:13.870 --> 01:14:13.880 align:start position:0%
term on Village districts in one way
 
01:14:15.830 --> 01:14:15.840 align:start position:0%
shape or form or another so I doubt that
 
01:14:20.310 --> 01:14:20.320 align:start position:0%
this will be the last one however um
 
01:14:23.709 --> 01:14:23.719 align:start position:0%
what we typically do not get are
 
01:14:27.510 --> 01:14:27.520 align:start position:0%
proposed bills that lay out special
 
01:14:30.550 --> 01:14:30.560 align:start position:0%
formulas for funding for individual
 
01:14:30.560 --> 01:14:32.149 align:start position:0%
formulas for funding for individual
Village

01:14:32.149 --> 01:14:32.159 align:start position:0%
Village
 
01:14:37.110 --> 01:14:37.120 align:start position:0%
districts my question for you is are you
 
01:14:40.430 --> 01:14:40.440 align:start position:0%
concerned that by putting into statute
 
01:14:42.870 --> 01:14:42.880 align:start position:0%
something that affects kind of the
 
01:14:45.110 --> 01:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
nitty-gritty running of one Village
 
01:14:46.790 --> 01:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
District might have unintended
 
01:14:48.629 --> 01:14:48.639 align:start position:0%
consequences of all the other Village
 
01:14:50.470 --> 01:14:50.480 align:start position:0%
districts in the state well that's a
 
01:14:53.149 --> 01:14:53.159 align:start position:0%
very real concern
 
01:14:56.870 --> 01:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
yes further questions
 
01:14:58.510 --> 01:14:58.520 align:start position:0%

the years back to
 
01:16:27.750 --> 01:16:27.760 align:start position:0%

which we call
 
01:16:37.189 --> 01:16:37.199 align:start position:0%
havil years ago when there was a a road
 
01:16:39.149 --> 01:16:39.159 align:start position:0%
coming up from the conquered area it
 
01:16:41.510 --> 01:16:41.520 align:start position:0%

01:16:43.870 --> 01:16:43.880 align:start position:0%
where you have the common it's also
 
01:16:45.629 --> 01:16:45.639 align:start position:0%
where Dartmouth College wanted to plant
 
01:16:48.110 --> 01:16:48.120 align:start position:0%
its College initially but they chose in
 
01:16:49.870 --> 01:16:49.880 align:start position:0%
the end to go down to
 
01:16:53.149 --> 01:16:53.159 align:start position:0%
Hanover so hail is the southern uh
 
01:16:56.270 --> 01:16:56.280 align:start position:0%

commission for a number of years uh we
 
01:17:11.470 --> 01:17:11.480 align:start position:0%
had our own fire department since then
 
01:17:13.270 --> 01:17:13.280 align:start position:0%
the fire department has merged in with
 
01:17:17.030 --> 01:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
the town of havil under a lot of angst
 
01:17:19.550 --> 01:17:19.560 align:start position:0%
going north to North havil North havil
 
01:17:22.590 --> 01:17:22.600 align:start position:0%
also has their own water department they
 
01:17:24.870 --> 01:17:24.880 align:start position:0%
also have their own their their fire
 
01:17:26.830 --> 01:17:26.840 align:start position:0%
Department which is now part of the
 
01:17:29.830 --> 01:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
Town Mountain Lakes does not have a fire
 
01:17:32.430 --> 01:17:32.440 align:start position:0%
department Mountain Lakes was initially
 
01:17:34.070 --> 01:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
a private
 
01:17:37.189 --> 01:17:37.199 align:start position:0%
corporation that was uh which has a
 
01:17:40.790 --> 01:17:40.800 align:start position:0%
sizable a with the lake as described by
 
01:17:44.110 --> 01:17:44.120 align:start position:0%
uh the senator uh it was a community
 
01:17:46.070 --> 01:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
which went bankrupt though and the town
 
01:17:48.229 --> 01:17:48.239 align:start position:0%
had to take it all over and there's
 
01:17:49.990 --> 01:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
roads going up and down the hills and
 
01:17:52.430 --> 01:17:52.440 align:start position:0%
all over the place and there's boundary
 
01:17:55.110 --> 01:17:55.120 align:start position:0%
uh uh uh question marks as far as far as
 
01:17:56.709 --> 01:17:56.719 align:start position:0%
whether you're on Town property or on
 
01:17:59.030 --> 01:17:59.040 align:start position:0%
Precinct property or you own property
 
01:18:00.709 --> 01:18:00.719 align:start position:0%
reminds me when I lived in Alaska we
 
01:18:02.110 --> 01:18:02.120 align:start position:0%
didn't know where the state owned land
 
01:18:04.390 --> 01:18:04.400 align:start position:0%
where the town own land or where the
 
01:18:07.310 --> 01:18:07.320 align:start position:0%
native corporations own land then we
 
01:18:10.070 --> 01:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
have Woodsville Woodsville is a
 
01:18:12.270 --> 01:18:12.280 align:start position:0%
community which has its own fire
 
01:18:14.790 --> 01:18:14.800 align:start position:0%
department all our emergency services
 
01:18:17.830 --> 01:18:17.840 align:start position:0%

01:18:25.320 --> 01:18:26.629 align:start position:0%
they have their own power they generate
Hydro

01:18:26.629 --> 01:18:26.639 align:start position:0%
Hydro
 
01:18:30.470 --> 01:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
power it is the Hub of our community in
 
01:18:32.430 --> 01:18:32.440 align:start position:0%
terms of retail businesses there are
 
01:18:34.750 --> 01:18:34.760 align:start position:0%
business elsewhere but that's where our
 
01:18:38.070 --> 01:18:38.080 align:start position:0%
assessed property values lay in
 
01:18:41.470 --> 01:18:41.480 align:start position:0%
Woodsville now when we are looking at
 
01:18:41.480 --> 01:18:42.550 align:start position:0%
Woodsville now when we are looking at
this

01:18:42.550 --> 01:18:42.560 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:18:45.390 --> 01:18:45.400 align:start position:0%

Woodsville that fire district resp is
 
01:18:58.310 --> 01:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
responsible for fire in that particular
 
01:19:00.950 --> 01:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
District but they're also part of Twin
 
01:19:03.070 --> 01:19:03.080 align:start position:0%
State Mutual Aid and so they have
 
01:19:04.910 --> 01:19:04.920 align:start position:0%
agreements they will work with fire
 
01:19:06.950 --> 01:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
departments all through the area when I
 
01:19:09.709 --> 01:19:09.719 align:start position:0%
first got on the select board we had
 
01:19:11.990 --> 01:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
these four districts but we also had
 
01:19:14.790 --> 01:19:14.800 align:start position:0%
outlayer areas within havil which were
 
01:19:17.910 --> 01:19:17.920 align:start position:0%
called havil which didn't pay any fire
 
01:19:19.110 --> 01:19:19.120 align:start position:0%
tax money at
 
01:19:21.870 --> 01:19:21.880 align:start position:0%
all the individual districts had their
 
01:19:23.990 --> 01:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
own fire departments other than Mountain
 
01:19:27.830 --> 01:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
Lakes and they were taxing for their
 
01:19:30.870 --> 01:19:30.880 align:start position:0%
those fire departments to serve there
 
01:19:33.070 --> 01:19:33.080 align:start position:0%
but also they had Twin State Mutual Aid
 
01:19:34.990 --> 01:19:35.000 align:start position:0%
where they worked out just provide
 
01:19:37.870 --> 01:19:37.880 align:start position:0%
services to all of havil but the people
 
01:19:39.430 --> 01:19:39.440 align:start position:0%
in the other areas of havil weren't
 
01:19:42.149 --> 01:19:42.159 align:start position:0%
paying any fire money so when I chaired
 
01:19:46.110 --> 01:19:46.120 align:start position:0%
the select board we went together as the
 
01:19:48.390 --> 01:19:48.400 align:start position:0%
all of them together uh all members of
 
01:19:49.910 --> 01:19:49.920 align:start position:0%
the select board and the Commissioners
 
01:19:52.149 --> 01:19:52.159 align:start position:0%
together and we decided it was only fair
 
01:19:55.430 --> 01:19:55.440 align:start position:0%
that everybody in the whole area of hav
 
01:19:58.590 --> 01:19:58.600 align:start position:0%
pay for fire Services we did that we
 
01:20:01.669 --> 01:20:01.679 align:start position:0%
came together and agreed upon let's move
 
01:20:04.430 --> 01:20:04.440 align:start position:0%
and consolidate and get together and
 
01:20:06.030 --> 01:20:06.040 align:start position:0%
that's what we were in the process of
 
01:20:09.550 --> 01:20:09.560 align:start position:0%
doing back in 2009 as I mentioned
 
01:20:11.590 --> 01:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
earlier under Senate Bill
 
01:20:16.070 --> 01:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
75 when I first came in in 2008 and
 
01:20:18.950 --> 01:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
2009 Senator Reynolds myself and
 
01:20:21.310 --> 01:20:21.320 align:start position:0%
representative iner britson got together
 
01:20:22.790 --> 01:20:22.800 align:start position:0%
and developed a
 
01:20:25.470 --> 01:20:25.480 align:start position:0%
formula and the formula had previously
 
01:20:27.790 --> 01:20:27.800 align:start position:0%
been done by Paul Lamont back in the
 
01:20:31.149 --> 01:20:31.159 align:start position:0%
1990s representative Lamont we updated
 
01:20:32.510 --> 01:20:32.520 align:start position:0%
that formula I have a copy of that
 
01:20:34.590 --> 01:20:34.600 align:start position:0%
formula right here that formula was
 
01:20:37.229 --> 01:20:37.239 align:start position:0%
unanimously agreed upon by the
 
01:20:39.229 --> 01:20:39.239 align:start position:0%
Commissioners in Woodsville and the
 
01:20:41.390 --> 01:20:41.400 align:start position:0%
select board we came together and agreed
 
01:20:45.390 --> 01:20:45.400 align:start position:0%
this is where we want to be un unanimous
 
01:20:47.030 --> 01:20:47.040 align:start position:0%
amongst all people in the community it
 
01:20:49.189 --> 01:20:49.199 align:start position:0%
was local control the way local control
 
01:20:50.629 --> 01:20:50.639 align:start position:0%
should be
 
01:20:55.270 --> 01:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
done since then we've had some conflict
 
01:20:57.070 --> 01:20:57.080 align:start position:0%
and we've changed Town
 
01:21:00.470 --> 01:21:00.480 align:start position:0%
managers just recently we've changed our
 
01:21:02.070 --> 01:21:02.080 align:start position:0%
form of government this last town
 
01:21:04.030 --> 01:21:04.040 align:start position:0%
meeting from town manager form of
 
01:21:07.350 --> 01:21:07.360 align:start position:0%
government to Town Administrator form of
 
01:21:11.110 --> 01:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
government the chair of the select board
 
01:21:11.120 --> 01:21:14.750 align:start position:0%
government the chair of the select board
has

01:21:14.750 --> 01:21:14.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:20.390 --> 01:21:20.400 align:start position:0%
resigned the road agent for havil has
 
01:21:23.510 --> 01:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
resigned we have conflict up there the
 
01:21:25.510 --> 01:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
finance administrator
 
01:21:29.070 --> 01:21:29.080 align:start position:0%
is gone the town of hail is in flux
 
01:21:29.080 --> 01:21:30.310 align:start position:0%
is gone the town of hail is in flux
right

01:21:30.310 --> 01:21:30.320 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:21:33.390 --> 01:21:33.400 align:start position:0%
now the District of Woodsville is
 
01:21:36.229 --> 01:21:36.239 align:start position:0%
not we have a court case going on right
 
01:21:39.070 --> 01:21:39.080 align:start position:0%
now which I believe we need to let that
 
01:21:41.510 --> 01:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
case resolve itself and determine where
 
01:21:43.430 --> 01:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
we're going to go with all this business
 
01:21:45.950 --> 01:21:45.960 align:start position:0%
upon a decision being made by the court
 
01:21:50.149 --> 01:21:50.159 align:start position:0%
system not prior to and not as a result
 
01:21:52.310 --> 01:21:52.320 align:start position:0%
of this bill or any other effort that
 
01:21:55.430 --> 01:21:55.440 align:start position:0%
was Prior made to this
 
01:21:57.629 --> 01:21:57.639 align:start position:0%
now what we have is a bill that's coming
 
01:21:59.870 --> 01:21:59.880 align:start position:0%
forward that does not have the support
 
01:22:00.910 --> 01:22:00.920 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:22:02.990 --> 01:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
Commissioners we're not working together
 
01:22:04.830 --> 01:22:04.840 align:start position:0%
we're just splitting this town apart and
 
01:22:07.790 --> 01:22:07.800 align:start position:0%
believe me we are splitting it apart
 
01:22:11.030 --> 01:22:11.040 align:start position:0%
havil years back is it's in a
 
01:22:14.390 --> 01:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
Cooperative School District we had a
 
01:22:17.070 --> 01:22:17.080 align:start position:0%
Academy down in havil corner and up
 
01:22:18.870 --> 01:22:18.880 align:start position:0%
later on when that closed down we went
 
01:22:20.550 --> 01:22:20.560 align:start position:0%
to Woodsville there was a lot of angst
 
01:22:22.189 --> 01:22:22.199 align:start position:0%
there oh we don't want our kids going up
 
01:22:25.030 --> 01:22:25.040 align:start position:0%
to Woodsville we want them down in havil
 
01:22:28.030 --> 01:22:28.040 align:start position:0%
we got over that and we got through it
 
01:22:30.709 --> 01:22:30.719 align:start position:0%
but that old wound is surfacing again as
 
01:22:32.870 --> 01:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
a result of this legislation and
 
01:22:35.709 --> 01:22:35.719 align:start position:0%
legislation we've had in past years I
 
01:22:38.790 --> 01:22:38.800 align:start position:0%
suggest that we need to back off and
 
01:22:40.870 --> 01:22:40.880 align:start position:0%
recognize back in
 
01:22:44.430 --> 01:22:44.440 align:start position:0%
1885 statute Was Made Back Then
 
01:22:47.550 --> 01:22:47.560 align:start position:0%
designing the capability for Woodsville
 
01:22:49.950 --> 01:22:49.960 align:start position:0%
to have their Highway Department the
 
01:22:52.590 --> 01:22:52.600 align:start position:0%
fire and to act as a
 
01:22:56.149 --> 01:22:56.159 align:start position:0%
municipality but there's still a Village
 
01:22:59.390 --> 01:22:59.400 align:start position:0%
District what the town of havil provides
 
01:23:01.390 --> 01:23:01.400 align:start position:0%
from the town offices is our police
 
01:23:03.709 --> 01:23:03.719 align:start position:0%
force and we have a very very large
 
01:23:03.719 --> 01:23:04.669 align:start position:0%
force and we have a very very large
police

01:23:04.669 --> 01:23:04.679 align:start position:0%
police
 
01:23:07.270 --> 01:23:07.280 align:start position:0%
force you know approximating around
 
01:23:10.510 --> 01:23:10.520 align:start position:0%
eight officers then we have the County
 
01:23:11.950 --> 01:23:11.960 align:start position:0%
Complex located there so we have the
 
01:23:13.750 --> 01:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
sheriff's department there and we have
 
01:23:15.470 --> 01:23:15.480 align:start position:0%
state troopers there as well so we have
 
01:23:18.870 --> 01:23:18.880 align:start position:0%
a lot of good protection but we have to
 
01:23:21.310 --> 01:23:21.320 align:start position:0%
look at this this issue right here I
 
01:23:23.149 --> 01:23:23.159 align:start position:0%
don't think it's the right time for us
 
01:23:25.149 --> 01:23:25.159 align:start position:0%
to be moving something like this forward
 
01:23:27.270 --> 01:23:27.280 align:start position:0%
quite truthfully either we back it off
 
01:23:29.669 --> 01:23:29.679 align:start position:0%
to what represent our Senator Reynolds
 
01:23:32.110 --> 01:23:32.120 align:start position:0%
and Paul erson and myself decided back
 
01:23:37.110 --> 01:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
in uh the year um uh 2009 and I have
 
01:23:38.669 --> 01:23:38.679 align:start position:0%
that legislation right here which your
 
01:23:40.390 --> 01:23:40.400 align:start position:0%
bill could be amended quite easily put
 
01:23:42.990 --> 01:23:43.000 align:start position:0%
that in where it's the there's a formula
 
01:23:44.750 --> 01:23:44.760 align:start position:0%
for how we divide the money up the money
 
01:23:48.470 --> 01:23:48.480 align:start position:0%
is collected by the town yes but then
 
01:23:50.430 --> 01:23:50.440 align:start position:0%
how is it distributed down to support
 
01:23:52.990 --> 01:23:53.000 align:start position:0%
the highway department in Woodsville
 
01:23:55.830 --> 01:23:55.840 align:start position:0%
Woodsville has their own sidewalk walks
 
01:23:57.550 --> 01:23:57.560 align:start position:0%
their own sewer system running along the
 
01:23:59.470 --> 01:23:59.480 align:start position:0%
side of the road all the roads are paved
 
01:24:01.270 --> 01:24:01.280 align:start position:0%
much different some the gravel roads
 
01:24:02.510 --> 01:24:02.520 align:start position:0%
which are out in
 
01:24:05.590 --> 01:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
hail and they've done a tremendous job
 
01:24:07.830 --> 01:24:07.840 align:start position:0%
of maintaining those
 
01:24:10.350 --> 01:24:10.360 align:start position:0%
roads we also have you know the all the
 
01:24:12.030 --> 01:24:12.040 align:start position:0%
Lighting systems you know the you know
 
01:24:13.470 --> 01:24:13.480 align:start position:0%
those red yellow and green things we
 
01:24:16.350 --> 01:24:16.360 align:start position:0%
have to stop for they're in ha in in
 
01:24:19.350 --> 01:24:19.360 align:start position:0%
Woodsville so in conclusion I'd like to
 
01:24:22.990 --> 01:24:23.000 align:start position:0%
say that we have a system that's working
 
01:24:25.110 --> 01:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
but we don't have what's working
 
01:24:28.870 --> 01:24:28.880 align:start position:0%
is working together amongst our
 
01:24:31.870 --> 01:24:31.880 align:start position:0%
commissioners in Woodsville and the
 
01:24:33.990 --> 01:24:34.000 align:start position:0%
select board itself hopefully some
 
01:24:36.030 --> 01:24:36.040 align:start position:0%
changes will be made the Woodsville
 
01:24:37.629 --> 01:24:37.639 align:start position:0%
Commissioners have come to the town
 
01:24:39.950 --> 01:24:39.960 align:start position:0%
often say let's sit down and talk about
 
01:24:42.270 --> 01:24:42.280 align:start position:0%
this oh we can't talk about this because
 
01:24:43.950 --> 01:24:43.960 align:start position:0%
it's in the court system right now and
 
01:24:46.590 --> 01:24:46.600 align:start position:0%
we can't talk and that's what so that's
 
01:24:49.229 --> 01:24:49.239 align:start position:0%
what's going on it's time for us to slow
 
01:24:51.669 --> 01:24:51.679 align:start position:0%
down as a legislature let's this thing
 
01:24:55.030 --> 01:24:55.040 align:start position:0%
hammer out quite frankly either itl this
 
01:24:57.950 --> 01:24:57.960 align:start position:0%
thing or interum study it but to move it
 
01:24:59.470 --> 01:24:59.480 align:start position:0%
forward it's going to cause more
 
01:25:01.510 --> 01:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
conflict and we're going to have another
 
01:25:05.830 --> 01:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
Community that's just uh inflames and by
 
01:25:09.229 --> 01:25:09.239 align:start position:0%
the way Pike is not a district pike pike
 
01:25:11.590 --> 01:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
is an area they used to have a water
 
01:25:13.629 --> 01:25:13.639 align:start position:0%
system that's been closed down there
 
01:25:16.669 --> 01:25:16.679 align:start position:0%
only were 15 people on that water system
 
01:25:20.790 --> 01:25:20.800 align:start position:0%
um so I and one other thing it was
 
01:25:22.470 --> 01:25:22.480 align:start position:0%
declared that Woodsville had to go
 
01:25:24.149 --> 01:25:24.159 align:start position:0%
through and do an audit they've done all
 
01:25:26.550 --> 01:25:26.560 align:start position:0%
the audits they came out clean at one
 
01:25:28.590 --> 01:25:28.600 align:start position:0%
point in time the legislature or
 
01:25:29.950 --> 01:25:29.960 align:start position:0%
representatives from the other side of
 
01:25:32.510 --> 01:25:32.520 align:start position:0%
the wall were saying we need a forensic
 
01:25:35.189 --> 01:25:35.199 align:start position:0%
audit done of
 
01:25:38.310 --> 01:25:38.320 align:start position:0%
Woodsville no no that's not what's
 
01:25:42.070 --> 01:25:42.080 align:start position:0%
needed and the audits have come out by
 
01:25:43.510 --> 01:25:43.520 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue Administration
 
01:25:45.790 --> 01:25:45.800 align:start position:0%
saying everything is clean in fact audit
 
01:25:48.709 --> 01:25:48.719 align:start position:0%
all the audits have been done by
 
01:25:51.590 --> 01:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
Woodsville even before the town audit
 
01:25:51.600 --> 01:25:52.990 align:start position:0%
Woodsville even before the town audit
got

01:25:52.990 --> 01:25:53.000 align:start position:0%
got
 
01:25:57.109 --> 01:25:57.119 align:start position:0%
done so so that's where I stand Mr chair
 
01:26:00.070 --> 01:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
it's a I think we get where you are it's
 
01:26:05.510 --> 01:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:08.550 --> 01:26:08.560 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
01:26:11.310 --> 01:26:11.320 align:start position:0%
power thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:26:13.430 --> 01:26:13.440 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question so
 
01:26:15.109 --> 01:26:15.119 align:start position:0%
I'll ask you the same question that I
 
01:26:17.470 --> 01:26:17.480 align:start position:0%
asked the prime sponsor and it's with
 
01:26:20.790 --> 01:26:20.800 align:start position:0%
regards to what is Woodsville so my
 
01:26:23.149 --> 01:26:23.159 align:start position:0%
understanding that I see that it's
 
01:26:26.950 --> 01:26:26.960 align:start position:0%
Woodsville fire district and
 
01:26:30.709 --> 01:26:30.719 align:start position:0%
my my belief is that it's a village
 
01:26:33.229 --> 01:26:33.239 align:start position:0%
district for the purpose of
 
01:26:37.550 --> 01:26:37.560 align:start position:0%
extinguishing fires and I I also think
 
01:26:40.310 --> 01:26:40.320 align:start position:0%
that I understand that part of that
 
01:26:42.430 --> 01:26:42.440 align:start position:0%
Village District function also has to do
 
01:26:42.440 --> 01:26:43.149 align:start position:0%
Village District function also has to do
with

01:26:43.149 --> 01:26:43.159 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:26:46.950 --> 01:26:46.960 align:start position:0%
roads so again I'm confused
 
01:26:49.590 --> 01:26:49.600 align:start position:0%
because based on like I said before the
 
01:26:51.910 --> 01:26:51.920 align:start position:0%
research that I've done some people
 
01:26:55.189 --> 01:26:55.199 align:start position:0%
think that Woodsville is a town when
 
01:26:58.830 --> 01:26:58.840 align:start position:0%
it's really not it's a village District
 
01:27:01.629 --> 01:27:01.639 align:start position:0%
do you see this as part of the confus
 
01:27:04.830 --> 01:27:04.840 align:start position:0%
correct it has powers to to raise
 
01:27:07.590 --> 01:27:07.600 align:start position:0%
inappropriate taxes for the purposes of
 
01:27:10.990 --> 01:27:11.000 align:start position:0%
which it was formed which I'm assuming
 
01:27:12.950 --> 01:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
it's the fire district the fire district
 
01:27:14.669 --> 01:27:14.679 align:start position:0%
but it's a village District which has
 
01:27:16.790 --> 01:27:16.800 align:start position:0%
the authority by Statute to have their
 
01:27:18.629 --> 01:27:18.639 align:start position:0%
own Highway Department their own Road
 
01:27:22.189 --> 01:27:22.199 align:start position:0%
agent uh it goes beyond what the what
 
01:27:26.270 --> 01:27:26.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:28.709 --> 01:27:28.719 align:start position:0%
and there are the the administrator for
 
01:27:31.270 --> 01:27:31.280 align:start position:0%
that district is sitting behind me and I
 
01:27:33.870 --> 01:27:33.880 align:start position:0%
think you best asked Mr Shelton that
 
01:27:37.990 --> 01:27:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:41.070 --> 01:27:41.080 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
01:27:43.910 --> 01:27:43.920 align:start position:0%
Gallagher um
 
01:27:49.310 --> 01:27:49.320 align:start position:0%
so about the part where you said that um
 
01:27:52.590 --> 01:27:52.600 align:start position:0%
every audit of Woodsville has uh come
 
01:27:55.149 --> 01:27:55.159 align:start position:0%
back clean in the past as I was
 
01:27:57.390 --> 01:27:57.400 align:start position:0%
reviewing my notes from the past bills
 
01:28:01.350 --> 01:28:01.360 align:start position:0%
we had and um apparently part of the
 
01:28:06.149 --> 01:28:06.159 align:start position:0%
reason we had um SB
 
01:28:10.149 --> 01:28:10.159 align:start position:0%
um s SB uh the previous bills I
 
01:28:12.669 --> 01:28:12.679 align:start position:0%
mentioned was because that Woodsville
 
01:28:16.390 --> 01:28:16.400 align:start position:0%
had failed in audit so um are are are my
 
01:28:19.229 --> 01:28:19.239 align:start position:0%
notes wrong on that I think if you're
 
01:28:21.310 --> 01:28:21.320 align:start position:0%
talking about s
 
01:28:25.750 --> 01:28:25.760 align:start position:0%
sp25 uh sb75 came prior to that that is
 
01:28:28.990 --> 01:28:29.000 align:start position:0%
what was said but there's no factual
 
01:28:30.870 --> 01:28:30.880 align:start position:0%
information to back any of that up when
 
01:28:32.629 --> 01:28:32.639 align:start position:0%
the audits were completed and you can
 
01:28:34.430 --> 01:28:34.440 align:start position:0%
ask the people that were audited they're
 
01:28:38.270 --> 01:28:38.280 align:start position:0%
sitting behind me there is no uh
 
01:28:41.390 --> 01:28:41.400 align:start position:0%
forensic audit needed and the audits
 
01:28:44.149 --> 01:28:44.159 align:start position:0%
were done as as all of you know that
 
01:28:46.109 --> 01:28:46.119 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of towns in this state
 
01:28:49.510 --> 01:28:49.520 align:start position:0%
which are small towns and they did
 
01:28:51.629 --> 01:28:51.639 align:start position:0%
things years ago the way the good old
 
01:28:54.270 --> 01:28:54.280 align:start position:0%
boys may have done it and they put the
 
01:28:55.750 --> 01:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
in the till right here and they took the
 
01:28:58.830 --> 01:28:58.840 align:start position:0%
money out and they co-mingled monies but
 
01:29:01.510 --> 01:29:01.520 align:start position:0%
it wasn't done with any purpose for you
 
01:29:05.310 --> 01:29:05.320 align:start position:0%
know for a forensic type issue so I can
 
01:29:08.629 --> 01:29:08.639 align:start position:0%
go to all the towns I I Haver itself's
 
01:29:11.030 --> 01:29:11.040 align:start position:0%
probably done that Pont have done that
 
01:29:12.390 --> 01:29:12.400 align:start position:0%
they all had done
 
01:29:14.590 --> 01:29:14.600 align:start position:0%
that further
 
01:29:17.189 --> 01:29:17.199 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
01:29:20.470 --> 01:29:20.480 align:start position:0%
Guthrie thank you thank you Mr chair and
 
01:29:24.229 --> 01:29:24.239 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming and testifying
 
01:29:25.870 --> 01:29:25.880 align:start position:0%
I I come from a
 
01:29:29.629 --> 01:29:29.639 align:start position:0%
town uh and I really don't understand
 
01:29:32.310 --> 01:29:32.320 align:start position:0%
the structure that you have in the havil
 
01:29:36.550 --> 01:29:36.560 align:start position:0%
area can you tell me why at any time
 
01:29:39.830 --> 01:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
they did not in even consider
 
01:29:42.270 --> 01:29:42.280 align:start position:0%
incorporating all the areas that are in
 
01:29:45.510 --> 01:29:45.520 align:start position:0%
dispute into one town we were working in
 
01:29:47.709 --> 01:29:47.719 align:start position:0%
that direction in terms of fire Services
 
01:29:50.550 --> 01:29:50.560 align:start position:0%
when we combined into one budget and we
 
01:29:52.669 --> 01:29:52.679 align:start position:0%
also put a committee together which
 
01:29:54.669 --> 01:29:54.679 align:start position:0%
looked at all our capital equipment our
 
01:29:57.870 --> 01:29:57.880 align:start position:0%
Rolling Stock in terms of fire havil had
 
01:29:59.430 --> 01:29:59.440 align:start position:0%
more equipment at that time than the
 
01:30:00.870 --> 01:30:00.880 align:start position:0%
town of Littleton
 
01:30:03.629 --> 01:30:03.639 align:start position:0%
had and so when we purchase new
 
01:30:05.270 --> 01:30:05.280 align:start position:0%
equipment now it has to go for that
 
01:30:07.910 --> 01:30:07.920 align:start position:0%
committee and we make sure that it's
 
01:30:09.550 --> 01:30:09.560 align:start position:0%
what the North or the South End of the
 
01:30:10.990 --> 01:30:11.000 align:start position:0%
Town need do we need something that's
 
01:30:12.430 --> 01:30:12.440 align:start position:0%
going to be a water truck do we need a
 
01:30:15.070 --> 01:30:15.080 align:start position:0%
ladder truck um so we're we're working
 
01:30:16.990 --> 01:30:17.000 align:start position:0%
towards that end and that was the
 
01:30:18.950 --> 01:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
direction we were going at but then all
 
01:30:20.709 --> 01:30:20.719 align:start position:0%
of a sudden the state got
 
01:30:24.270 --> 01:30:24.280 align:start position:0%
involved and it all fell apart
 
01:30:26.709 --> 01:30:26.719 align:start position:0%
and we weren't talking with each other
 
01:30:28.990 --> 01:30:29.000 align:start position:0%
and with that I think we need to get
 
01:30:31.390 --> 01:30:31.400 align:start position:0%
back to that this is a it's much like
 
01:30:34.590 --> 01:30:34.600 align:start position:0%
Conway was at one point in time Conway
 
01:30:36.750 --> 01:30:36.760 align:start position:0%
had all the different little districts
 
01:30:38.830 --> 01:30:38.840 align:start position:0%
were there but we are dealing with a
 
01:30:41.310 --> 01:30:41.320 align:start position:0%
very unique situation in Woodsville and
 
01:30:44.669 --> 01:30:44.679 align:start position:0%
I my family goes back in fact eight
 
01:30:46.550 --> 01:30:46.560 align:start position:0%
Generations nine Generations ago my
 
01:30:48.590 --> 01:30:48.600 align:start position:0%
grandfather was one who founded the town
 
01:30:48.600 --> 01:30:49.510 align:start position:0%
grandfather was one who founded the town
of

01:30:49.510 --> 01:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:30:52.629 --> 01:30:52.639 align:start position:0%
havil and so there's a lot of history
 
01:30:55.750 --> 01:30:55.760 align:start position:0%
there um it's wonderful place to live
 
01:30:58.990 --> 01:30:59.000 align:start position:0%
when we did our survey of updating where
 
01:31:01.629 --> 01:31:01.639 align:start position:0%
we were our master plan people came
 
01:31:03.229 --> 01:31:03.239 align:start position:0%
there because they love the quality of
 
01:31:05.390 --> 01:31:05.400 align:start position:0%
life they love the relationship we have
 
01:31:07.750 --> 01:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
to the land and they love the nature of
 
01:31:09.950 --> 01:31:09.960 align:start position:0%
the farming Community but they also love
 
01:31:12.470 --> 01:31:12.480 align:start position:0%
the nature of what we have in Woodsville
 
01:31:15.270 --> 01:31:15.280 align:start position:0%
so um it's Unique we don't have any
 
01:31:17.310 --> 01:31:17.320 align:start position:0%
public libraries we all have private
 
01:31:19.189 --> 01:31:19.199 align:start position:0%
libraries I think you answered the
 
01:31:22.149 --> 01:31:22.159 align:start position:0%

Shelton good
 
01:32:10.229 --> 01:32:10.239 align:start position:0%
morning good morning thank you honorable
 
01:32:12.350 --> 01:32:12.360 align:start position:0%
representatives for allowing me to speak
 
01:32:14.590 --> 01:32:14.600 align:start position:0%
I'm Kevin Shelton I am the administrator
 
01:32:17.189 --> 01:32:17.199 align:start position:0%
for the Woodsville fire district I've
 
01:32:19.950 --> 01:32:19.960 align:start position:0%
been there for four and a half years
 
01:32:23.030 --> 01:32:23.040 align:start position:0%
now um I appreciate the work that the
 
01:32:24.390 --> 01:32:24.400 align:start position:0%
Senate has done
 
01:32:26.470 --> 01:32:26.480 align:start position:0%
and the investment that you folks more
 
01:32:29.149 --> 01:32:29.159 align:start position:0%
than likely will put into this uh but I
 
01:32:32.070 --> 01:32:32.080 align:start position:0%
feel um I'm in opposition of it because
 
01:32:35.350 --> 01:32:35.360 align:start position:0%
I feel it still needs some
 
01:32:40.030 --> 01:32:40.040 align:start position:0%
work um I the question was asked uh what
 
01:32:42.830 --> 01:32:42.840 align:start position:0%
is Woodsville and I try to answer that
 
01:32:46.790 --> 01:32:46.800 align:start position:0%
now um it was it was formed in 1885 to
 
01:32:46.800 --> 01:32:47.950 align:start position:0%
now um it was it was formed in 1885 to
extinguish

01:32:47.950 --> 01:32:47.960 align:start position:0%
extinguish
 
01:32:50.310 --> 01:32:50.320 align:start position:0%
fires um and I believe it was school
 
01:32:52.990 --> 01:32:53.000 align:start position:0%
district number four was its footprint
 
01:32:56.070 --> 01:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
because I've gone back and and read that
 
01:32:59.109 --> 01:32:59.119 align:start position:0%
um its purposes have been expanded over
 
01:32:59.119 --> 01:32:59.990 align:start position:0%
um its purposes have been expanded over
the

01:32:59.990 --> 01:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:01.590 align:start position:0%
the
years

01:33:01.590 --> 01:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:33:07.669 --> 01:33:07.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:10.310 --> 01:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
Corporation um you know since its
 
01:33:12.709 --> 01:33:12.719 align:start position:0%
foundation it's always had a highway and
 
01:33:12.719 --> 01:33:14.070 align:start position:0%
foundation it's always had a highway and
fire

01:33:14.070 --> 01:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
fire
 
01:33:16.390 --> 01:33:16.400 align:start position:0%
department um and as somebody stated
 
01:33:19.669 --> 01:33:19.679 align:start position:0%
earlier uh it is the economic Center of
 
01:33:25.310 --> 01:33:25.320 align:start position:0%
of of Woodsville of town of havil um and
 
01:33:26.910 --> 01:33:26.920 align:start position:0%
there isn't a week that goes by that
 
01:33:28.990 --> 01:33:29.000 align:start position:0%
somebody doesn't say why don't we stop
 
01:33:30.709 --> 01:33:30.719 align:start position:0%
fighting why don't we turn into our own
 
01:33:32.390 --> 01:33:32.400 align:start position:0%
town you know and become the town of
 
01:33:35.790 --> 01:33:35.800 align:start position:0%
Woodsville so so there is that
 
01:33:40.830 --> 01:33:40.840 align:start position:0%
um that uh belief or or want in in in
 
01:33:43.270 --> 01:33:43.280 align:start position:0%
the area to to just have Woodsville go
 
01:33:48.430 --> 01:33:48.440 align:start position:0%
its own ways um however uh these Special
 
01:33:50.990 --> 01:33:51.000 align:start position:0%
Districts they they all serve many
 
01:33:55.470 --> 01:33:55.480 align:start position:0%
purposes um in addition to what Rick
 
01:33:57.189 --> 01:33:57.199 align:start position:0%
said Woodsville is about we have
 
01:34:00.590 --> 01:34:00.600 align:start position:0%
sidewalks we have street lights um you
 
01:34:03.709 --> 01:34:03.719 align:start position:0%
know the the village Village members all
 
01:34:07.189 --> 01:34:07.199 align:start position:0%
of them um you know
 
01:34:09.430 --> 01:34:09.440 align:start position:0%
appreciate all of those
 
01:34:14.470 --> 01:34:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:18.030 --> 01:34:18.040 align:start position:0%
um over the last 100 years Woodsville
 
01:34:20.629 --> 01:34:20.639 align:start position:0%
has always received back a proportionate
 
01:34:23.990 --> 01:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
share of the Town Highway budget
 
01:34:27.350 --> 01:34:27.360 align:start position:0%
um in 2019 there was a new town manager
 
01:34:32.189 --> 01:34:32.199 align:start position:0%
and the formula that was in place um was
 
01:34:35.310 --> 01:34:35.320 align:start position:0%
contested and it's it led to several
 
01:34:39.030 --> 01:34:39.040 align:start position:0%
years of litigation which Woodsville
 
01:34:42.109 --> 01:34:42.119 align:start position:0%
ultimately um the court decided in in
 
01:34:42.119 --> 01:34:43.270 align:start position:0%
ultimately um the court decided in in
its

01:34:43.270 --> 01:34:43.280 align:start position:0%
its
 
01:34:45.990 --> 01:34:46.000 align:start position:0%
favor that brought about additional
 
01:34:48.149 --> 01:34:48.159 align:start position:0%
legislation in 21 which took out the
 
01:34:52.950 --> 01:34:52.960 align:start position:0%
funding formula and it left it left uh
 
01:34:55.990 --> 01:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
it basically up to the voters by means
 
01:34:58.709 --> 01:34:58.719 align:start position:0%
of uh a warant article petitioned
 
01:35:00.990 --> 01:35:01.000 align:start position:0%
article at at the annual meeting for the
 
01:35:02.390 --> 01:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
voters to
 
01:35:06.510 --> 01:35:06.520 align:start position:0%
decide um the first year that occurred U
 
01:35:08.229 --> 01:35:08.239 align:start position:0%
it was passed and funding came to
 
01:35:10.870 --> 01:35:10.880 align:start position:0%
Woodsville or or was approved it was
 
01:35:13.229 --> 01:35:13.239 align:start position:0%
contested at by the town and the
 
01:35:14.790 --> 01:35:14.800 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue that it wasn't
 
01:35:17.229 --> 01:35:17.239 align:start position:0%
legal and that is what is before The
 
01:35:20.030 --> 01:35:20.040 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court right now there that
 
01:35:24.910 --> 01:35:24.920 align:start position:0%
hearing was in January and they uh they
 
01:35:26.550 --> 01:35:26.560 align:start position:0%
said it would be six to nine months
 
01:35:29.870 --> 01:35:29.880 align:start position:0%
before the outcome of that would would
 
01:35:29.880 --> 01:35:32.830 align:start position:0%
before the outcome of that would would
be

01:35:32.830 --> 01:35:32.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:32.840 --> 01:35:34.870 align:start position:0%
 
heard

01:35:34.870 --> 01:35:34.880 align:start position:0%
heard
 
01:35:38.590 --> 01:35:38.600 align:start position:0%
um so Woodsville population represents
 
01:35:42.470 --> 01:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
about 25% of the town of havil and we
 
01:35:44.910 --> 01:35:44.920 align:start position:0%
represent about
 
01:35:47.310 --> 01:35:47.320 align:start position:0%
22.75% of the tax
 
01:35:47.320 --> 01:35:49.310 align:start position:0%
22.75% of the tax
base

01:35:49.310 --> 01:35:49.320 align:start position:0%
base
 
01:35:52.709 --> 01:35:52.719 align:start position:0%
um we have two suggestions on a
 
01:35:54.629 --> 01:35:54.639 align:start position:0%
compromise that we would ask you to
 
01:35:59.910 --> 01:35:59.920 align:start position:0%
consider if if this isn't um tabled or
 
01:36:02.590 --> 01:36:02.600 align:start position:0%
put aside and and those would be to add
 
01:36:05.229 --> 01:36:05.239 align:start position:0%
back in capital projects to the highway
 
01:36:09.669 --> 01:36:09.679 align:start position:0%
formula um it can be a big part of the
 
01:36:13.030 --> 01:36:13.040 align:start position:0%
highway budget for the town of havil and
 
01:36:15.229 --> 01:36:15.239 align:start position:0%
it would that big part would be funded
 
01:36:19.430 --> 01:36:19.440 align:start position:0%
proportionally by by Woodsville um and
 
01:36:22.550 --> 01:36:22.560 align:start position:0%
the second is to calculate the fire
 
01:36:26.709 --> 01:36:26.719 align:start position:0%
funding formula on a per capita basis
 
01:36:34.229 --> 01:36:34.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:36.390 --> 01:36:36.400 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
01:36:38.550 --> 01:36:38.560 align:start position:0%
power thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
01:36:40.109 --> 01:36:40.119 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question and I'd like
 
01:36:42.350 --> 01:36:42.360 align:start position:0%
to um for you to clarify something for
 
01:36:45.790 --> 01:36:45.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:48.750 --> 01:36:48.760 align:start position:0%
2021 there there was a there was a bill
 
01:36:50.990 --> 01:36:51.000 align:start position:0%
to remove the funding formula from
 
01:36:52.550 --> 01:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
statute and I believe that was Senate
 
01:36:54.310 --> 01:36:54.320 align:start position:0%
Bill 26
 
01:36:58.590 --> 01:36:58.600 align:start position:0%
so I'm assuming that was signed into law
 
01:36:58.600 --> 01:36:59.750 align:start position:0%
so I'm assuming that was signed into law
and

01:36:59.750 --> 01:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:37:02.149 --> 01:37:02.159 align:start position:0%
so previously there was a funding
 
01:37:04.510 --> 01:37:04.520 align:start position:0%
formula in statute it was
 
01:37:08.109 --> 01:37:08.119 align:start position:0%
removed could you explain to me the pro
 
01:37:11.990 --> 01:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
you said a warrant article and
 
01:37:14.470 --> 01:37:14.480 align:start position:0%
then I just have one comment after that
 
01:37:18.189 --> 01:37:18.199 align:start position:0%
so now what's before us is another bill
 
01:37:20.910 --> 01:37:20.920 align:start position:0%
to put the funding formula back into
 
01:37:23.790 --> 01:37:23.800 align:start position:0%
statute so just yes or no on that and
 
01:37:23.800 --> 01:37:25.149 align:start position:0%
statute so just yes or no on that and
then

01:37:25.149 --> 01:37:25.159 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:37:28.189 --> 01:37:28.199 align:start position:0%
explain the what it looks like with
 
01:37:32.669 --> 01:37:32.679 align:start position:0%
regards to the funding by warrant
 
01:37:35.470 --> 01:37:35.480 align:start position:0%
articles explain that in Greater detail
 
01:37:39.310 --> 01:37:39.320 align:start position:0%
okay uh the first part uh yes the the
 
01:37:42.149 --> 01:37:42.159 align:start position:0%
the it took out the funding formula it
 
01:37:45.149 --> 01:37:45.159 align:start position:0%
made it only available by petitioned
 
01:37:47.270 --> 01:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
articles approved by the voters at the
 
01:37:50.070 --> 01:37:50.080 align:start position:0%
annual meeting so to me that took it out
 
01:37:52.870 --> 01:37:52.880 align:start position:0%
of the back room with six guys making
 
01:37:55.790 --> 01:37:55.800 align:start position:0%
the decision and put it before the the
 
01:37:58.189 --> 01:37:58.199 align:start position:0%
public the problem with that is it could
 
01:38:01.109 --> 01:38:01.119 align:start position:0%
be all or nothing or something in
 
01:38:04.189 --> 01:38:04.199 align:start position:0%
between the the challenge with the
 
01:38:07.589 --> 01:38:07.599 align:start position:0%
current language and why I've asked for
 
01:38:11.189 --> 01:38:11.199 align:start position:0%
consideration for uh compromise or or
 
01:38:13.990 --> 01:38:14.000 align:start position:0%
amending that is that the threshold is
 
01:38:18.270 --> 01:38:18.280 align:start position:0%
too low um From woodville's
 
01:38:22.229 --> 01:38:22.239 align:start position:0%
perspective and there would be no
 
01:38:25.589 --> 01:38:25.599 align:start position:0%
incentive for a to come to the table and
 
01:38:28.710 --> 01:38:28.720 align:start position:0%
negotiate a different
 
01:38:28.720 --> 01:38:30.910 align:start position:0%
negotiate a different
[Music]

01:38:30.910 --> 01:38:30.920 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:38:35.550 --> 01:38:35.560 align:start position:0%
agreement did I follow up thank you Mr
 
01:38:39.470 --> 01:38:39.480 align:start position:0%
chairman so to be clear is am I
 
01:38:41.229 --> 01:38:41.239 align:start position:0%
understanding it properly that this you
 
01:38:43.950 --> 01:38:43.960 align:start position:0%
said petitioned Warren article so that
 
01:38:45.830 --> 01:38:45.840 align:start position:0%
that's obviously that's the citizens it
 
01:38:47.790 --> 01:38:47.800 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be the Commissioners put of the
 
01:38:49.350 --> 01:38:49.360 align:start position:0%
village District putting this forward
 
01:38:52.629 --> 01:38:52.639 align:start position:0%
it's citizens getting together drafting
 
01:38:54.510 --> 01:38:54.520 align:start position:0%
an article putting it on the warrant and
 
01:38:58.750 --> 01:38:58.760 align:start position:0%
it's so this petition warrant article is
 
01:38:58.760 --> 01:38:59.589 align:start position:0%
it's so this petition warrant article is
in

01:38:59.589 --> 01:38:59.599 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:39:01.589 --> 01:39:01.599 align:start position:0%
Woodsville the residents of the
 
01:39:05.350 --> 01:39:05.360 align:start position:0%
Woodsville fire district no no um it it
 
01:39:08.430 --> 01:39:08.440 align:start position:0%
is at the town's annual meeting is where
 
01:39:11.109 --> 01:39:11.119 align:start position:0%
that formulation would would
 
01:39:14.070 --> 01:39:14.080 align:start position:0%
be so it it would be the residents of
 
01:39:17.470 --> 01:39:17.480 align:start position:0%
the town of havil asking the taxpayers
 
01:39:23.629 --> 01:39:23.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:26.390 --> 01:39:26.400 align:start position:0%
pres of Guth thank you Mr chair and
 
01:39:29.310 --> 01:39:29.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony I just to
 
01:39:32.189 --> 01:39:32.199 align:start position:0%
get a concept of what we're dealing with
 
01:39:35.149 --> 01:39:35.159 align:start position:0%
here I understand there's three other
 
01:39:38.310 --> 01:39:38.320 align:start position:0%
areas there there's the haval city to
 
01:39:42.990 --> 01:39:43.000 align:start position:0%
the town of havil and uh the main
 
01:39:46.470 --> 01:39:46.480 align:start position:0%
area that's within the town of havil
 
01:39:49.709 --> 01:39:49.719 align:start position:0%
then there's three other districts how
 
01:39:52.669 --> 01:39:52.679 align:start position:0%
how involved are they in this dispute if
 
01:39:54.109 --> 01:39:54.119 align:start position:0%
you will
 
01:39:56.030 --> 01:39:56.040 align:start position:0%
uh they're on the
 
01:39:59.109 --> 01:39:59.119 align:start position:0%
sidelines um and and I don't think any
 
01:40:01.430 --> 01:40:01.440 align:start position:0%
of them are ready to give up their
 
01:40:05.229 --> 01:40:05.239 align:start position:0%
Special Districts uh we we actually are
 
01:40:07.830 --> 01:40:07.840 align:start position:0%
working together uh all all four
 
01:40:10.790 --> 01:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
commissions on on a water a potential
 
01:40:14.030 --> 01:40:14.040 align:start position:0%
Water Project right now so so we we we
 
01:40:16.390 --> 01:40:16.400 align:start position:0%
communicate we see each other but they
 
01:40:19.189 --> 01:40:19.199 align:start position:0%
each district feels it it has a purpose
 
01:40:21.750 --> 01:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
and a valid purpose uh for its
 
01:40:21.760 --> 01:40:23.510 align:start position:0%
and a valid purpose uh for its
constituents

01:40:23.510 --> 01:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
constituents
 
01:40:25.510 --> 01:40:25.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
01:40:27.629 --> 01:40:27.639 align:start position:0%
stavis thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:40:32.270 --> 01:40:32.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:35.510 --> 01:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
um to be blunt this feels like a rabbit
 
01:40:39.070 --> 01:40:39.080 align:start position:0%
hole to me uh this legislature and this
 
01:40:40.990 --> 01:40:41.000 align:start position:0%
committee within this legislature is
 
01:40:44.629 --> 01:40:44.639 align:start position:0%
about setting up structures and systems
 
01:40:44.639 --> 01:40:45.430 align:start position:0%
about setting up structures and systems
of

01:40:45.430 --> 01:40:45.440 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:40:49.510 --> 01:40:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:52.589 --> 01:40:52.599 align:start position:0%
individual divisions of government work
 
01:40:54.870 --> 01:40:54.880 align:start position:0%
out their budg issues and work out their
 
01:40:57.070 --> 01:40:57.080 align:start position:0%
personnel issues is up to them to
 
01:40:59.750 --> 01:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
resolve what is it about this issue that
 
01:41:07.310 --> 01:41:07.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:13.470 --> 01:41:13.480 align:start position:0%
resolve I My Hope Is that um the the
 
01:41:16.669 --> 01:41:16.679 align:start position:0%
formula as as it's written can can be
 
01:41:18.790 --> 01:41:18.800 align:start position:0%
one that both sides can agree
 
01:41:24.629 --> 01:41:24.639 align:start position:0%
on and without that there there
 
01:41:30.470 --> 01:41:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:33.070 --> 01:41:33.080 align:start position:0%
Bill further
 
01:41:36.470 --> 01:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
01:41:39.790 --> 01:41:39.800 align:start position:0%
testimony oh representative
 
01:41:43.189 --> 01:41:43.199 align:start position:0%
GTH sorry Mr chairman but thank you for
 
01:41:47.629 --> 01:41:47.639 align:start position:0%
the recognizing me I it just happened to
 
01:41:54.109 --> 01:41:54.119 align:start position:0%
uh come into my head is how
 
01:41:58.750 --> 01:41:58.760 align:start position:0%
I it sounds like you're able to okay
 
01:42:01.709 --> 01:42:01.719 align:start position:0%
I'll ask ask the question question is if
 
01:42:04.790 --> 01:42:04.800 align:start position:0%
this bill would be passed would that
 
01:42:07.430 --> 01:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
bring all parties together or would it
 
01:42:10.470 --> 01:42:10.480 align:start position:0%
cause more of a problem than it that
 
01:42:10.480 --> 01:42:11.709 align:start position:0%
cause more of a problem than it that
already

01:42:11.709 --> 01:42:11.719 align:start position:0%
already
 
01:42:14.910 --> 01:42:14.920 align:start position:0%
exists sir I I don't believe this would
 
01:42:18.350 --> 01:42:18.360 align:start position:0%
pull everyone together this formul as as
 
01:42:21.950 --> 01:42:21.960 align:start position:0%
I see it um and have run the numbers
 
01:42:23.750 --> 01:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
would provide
 
01:42:23.760 --> 01:42:25.350 align:start position:0%
would provide
uh

01:42:25.350 --> 01:42:25.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:42:28.229 --> 01:42:28.239 align:start position:0%
Woodsville uh roughly
 
01:42:31.350 --> 01:42:31.360 align:start position:0%
$150,000 a year towards the highway
 
01:42:34.229 --> 01:42:34.239 align:start position:0%
budget the highway budget we expend over
 
01:42:36.830 --> 01:42:36.840 align:start position:0%
300,000 and and frankly the last four
 
01:42:39.870 --> 01:42:39.880 align:start position:0%
years it has just been getting by so
 
01:42:42.669 --> 01:42:42.679 align:start position:0%
we've done no zero capital projects and
 
01:42:44.589 --> 01:42:44.599 align:start position:0%
highways so that
 
01:42:47.589 --> 01:42:47.599 align:start position:0%
number's uh going to be a lot lot higher
 
01:42:50.589 --> 01:42:50.599 align:start position:0%
than that and I think passing this
 
01:42:53.870 --> 01:42:53.880 align:start position:0%
ultimately would put or could Woodsville
 
01:42:56.790 --> 01:42:56.800 align:start position:0%
out of the the the road business our
 
01:42:59.510 --> 01:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
taxes are exceptionally High you know
 
01:43:03.430 --> 01:43:03.440 align:start position:0%
most of that is centered around
 
01:43:08.070 --> 01:43:08.080 align:start position:0%
um education as you all know but um add
 
01:43:10.510 --> 01:43:10.520 align:start position:0%
the town tax in and then the precinct
 
01:43:13.149 --> 01:43:13.159 align:start position:0%
tax which is roughly
 
01:43:17.870 --> 01:43:17.880 align:start position:0%
$9,000 without doing anything um and in
 
01:43:20.430 --> 01:43:20.440 align:start position:0%
Highway being currently five5 or $6 doar
 
01:43:23.149 --> 01:43:23.159 align:start position:0%
of that in round numbers I think it puts
 
01:43:25.030 --> 01:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
is out of the highway business the
 
01:43:27.030 --> 01:43:27.040 align:start position:0%
voters will decide ultimately whether
 
01:43:29.030 --> 01:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
they can afford it or not but that's
 
01:43:32.070 --> 01:43:32.080 align:start position:0%
where this would put put things without
 
01:43:35.990 --> 01:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
resolve followup Mr chair so is it fair
 
01:43:38.550 --> 01:43:38.560 align:start position:0%
to say that uh followup go ahead thank
 
01:43:42.629 --> 01:43:42.639 align:start position:0%
you uh is it fair to say uh that this
 
01:43:46.790 --> 01:43:46.800 align:start position:0%
bill would not act as a uh a catalyst to
 
01:43:50.390 --> 01:43:50.400 align:start position:0%
get it because my understanding is right
 
01:43:54.189 --> 01:43:54.199 align:start position:0%
now the the side how many sides there
 
01:43:56.629 --> 01:43:56.639 align:start position:0%
are are not really talking anymore
 
01:43:59.550 --> 01:43:59.560 align:start position:0%
that's they walk away from the table if
 
01:44:01.270 --> 01:44:01.280 align:start position:0%
that's the case will this bring them
 
01:44:05.030 --> 01:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
back and act as a catalyst or will it
 
01:44:07.629 --> 01:44:07.639 align:start position:0%
just I've testified I don't believe that
 
01:44:09.310 --> 01:44:09.320 align:start position:0%
there's any incentive from the other
 
01:44:12.310 --> 01:44:12.320 align:start position:0%
side to to want to negotiate further
 
01:44:14.109 --> 01:44:14.119 align:start position:0%
with the way this is written right thank
 
01:44:16.070 --> 01:44:16.080 align:start position:0%

01:44:41.470 --> 01:44:41.480 align:start position:0%
committee um I've lived in Woodsville

for over 50 years since I come home from
 
01:44:46.790 --> 01:44:46.800 align:start position:0%
Vietnam I
 
01:44:49.790 --> 01:44:49.800 align:start position:0%
um this bill will definitely kill the
 
01:44:50.870 --> 01:44:50.880 align:start position:0%
highway in
 
01:44:53.030 --> 01:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
Woodsville it doesn't give us any
 
01:44:54.470 --> 01:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
anywhere near enough I'm the chair of
 
01:44:55.830 --> 01:44:55.840 align:start position:0%
the commission up
 
01:44:58.470 --> 01:44:58.480 align:start position:0%
there uh we've tried to sit down we've
 
01:45:01.390 --> 01:45:01.400 align:start position:0%
given them more opportunities we sent in
 
01:45:02.910 --> 01:45:02.920 align:start position:0%
letters they don't they aren't going to
 
01:45:05.030 --> 01:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
communicate with us because this bill's
 
01:45:06.830 --> 01:45:06.840 align:start position:0%
in their
 
01:45:11.310 --> 01:45:11.320 align:start position:0%
favor uh it's just it's just killing us
 
01:45:13.229 --> 01:45:13.239 align:start position:0%
and besides this
 
01:45:18.589 --> 01:45:18.599 align:start position:0%
bill the town receives 1 million

$15,000 in vehicle registrations every
 
01:45:24.109 --> 01:45:24.119 align:start position:0%
year we've comped Ed that a third of

01:45:31.229 --> 01:45:31.239 align:start position:0%
receipts from that also rooms and meals
 
01:45:34.270 --> 01:45:34.280 align:start position:0%

zero

01:45:54.550 --> 01:45:54.560 align:start position:0%
zero
 
01:45:58.070 --> 01:45:58.080 align:start position:0%
the Opera block and the other
 
01:46:00.229 --> 01:46:00.239 align:start position:0%
um HUD
 
01:46:04.189 --> 01:46:04.199 align:start position:0%
housing it getes about $43,000 a year
 
01:46:06.550 --> 01:46:06.560 align:start position:0%
they're all in Woodsville we don't get
 
01:46:08.030 --> 01:46:08.040 align:start position:0%
any money from
 
01:46:10.510 --> 01:46:10.520 align:start position:0%
that the population in Woodsville is
 
01:46:14.189 --> 01:46:14.199 align:start position:0%
12200 people we have to supply a ladder
 
01:46:16.189 --> 01:46:16.199 align:start position:0%
truck because of the Opera block the
 
01:46:18.870 --> 01:46:18.880 align:start position:0%
town has no ladder truck we have to
 
01:46:21.910 --> 01:46:21.920 align:start position:0%
because it's three stories according to
 
01:46:23.550 --> 01:46:23.560 align:start position:0%
the rules and regulations of Fire
 
01:46:26.189 --> 01:46:26.199 align:start position:0%
Systems we have to supply a lot of truck
 
01:46:27.790 --> 01:46:27.800 align:start position:0%
the town doesn't have one a lot of
 
01:46:29.350 --> 01:46:29.360 align:start position:0%
trucks over a million
 
01:46:31.750 --> 01:46:31.760 align:start position:0%
dollars the town is never bought any of
 
01:46:33.270 --> 01:46:33.280 align:start position:0%
our fire equipment we've bought all of
 
01:46:35.270 --> 01:46:35.280 align:start position:0%
our own fire equipment all of our own
 
01:46:37.470 --> 01:46:37.480 align:start position:0%
road equipment we've had been in the
 
01:46:38.870 --> 01:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
road business since
 
01:46:42.229 --> 01:46:42.239 align:start position:0%
1885 because Woodsville was the center
 
01:46:44.750 --> 01:46:44.760 align:start position:0%
of the railroad companies and the we had
 
01:46:46.270 --> 01:46:46.280 align:start position:0%
four different railroads coming through
 
01:46:49.350 --> 01:46:49.360 align:start position:0%
Woodsville in 1885 so we had to set up
 
01:46:51.750 --> 01:46:51.760 align:start position:0%
sewer systems we had to set up Road
 
01:46:54.910 --> 01:46:54.920 align:start position:0%
systems side walks there's no sidewalks
 
01:46:57.750 --> 01:46:57.760 align:start position:0%
in any other buy we have the curbs on
 
01:46:59.229 --> 01:46:59.239 align:start position:0%
the road we don't even know who owns
 
01:47:02.589 --> 01:47:02.599 align:start position:0%
them but if it's a town or if the town
 
01:47:04.350 --> 01:47:04.360 align:start position:0%
takes over our roads or if it's a
 
01:47:07.229 --> 01:47:07.239 align:start position:0%
sidewalks because of the carbon
 
01:47:10.589 --> 01:47:10.599 align:start position:0%
system it doesn't it's it's just killing
 
01:47:12.470 --> 01:47:12.480 align:start position:0%
me and the high school is in Woodsville
 
01:47:15.390 --> 01:47:15.400 align:start position:0%
it sets up on a hill if they don't plow
 
01:47:17.310 --> 01:47:17.320 align:start position:0%
the roads early enough and they don't
 
01:47:19.750 --> 01:47:19.760 align:start position:0%
plow their roads as early as we do they
 
01:47:23.270 --> 01:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
won't have any school that day cuz Hill
 
01:47:25.030 --> 01:47:25.040 align:start position:0%
goes both ways to get up to that High
 
01:47:27.229 --> 01:47:27.239 align:start position:0%
School the hospital's in the middle of a
 
01:47:30.229 --> 01:47:30.239 align:start position:0%
big hill I live just up beyond the
 
01:47:33.109 --> 01:47:33.119 align:start position:0%
hospital but when the town used to have
 
01:47:35.550 --> 01:47:35.560 align:start position:0%
that road before they turned it over to
 
01:47:37.750 --> 01:47:37.760 align:start position:0%
Woodsville there was many days we
 
01:47:39.229 --> 01:47:39.239 align:start position:0%
couldn't get home unless you had a
 
01:47:40.910 --> 01:47:40.920 align:start position:0%
four-wheel drive pickup because the town
 
01:47:43.030 --> 01:47:43.040 align:start position:0%
didn't have it plowed and now they built
 
01:47:45.870 --> 01:47:45.880 align:start position:0%
another complex that's a uh another
 
01:47:48.149 --> 01:47:48.159 align:start position:0%
Surgical Center across from the hospital
 
01:47:50.669 --> 01:47:50.679 align:start position:0%
the cars pull out you can't
 
01:47:52.669 --> 01:47:52.679 align:start position:0%
stop they pull out in front of you you
 
01:47:54.149 --> 01:47:54.159 align:start position:0%
can't can't stop going down that Hill
 
01:47:57.310 --> 01:47:57.320 align:start position:0%
it's so slippery uh it it's just a
 
01:47:58.910 --> 01:47:58.920 align:start position:0%
disaster this bill was just going to
 
01:48:01.950 --> 01:48:01.960 align:start position:0%
kill it and by passing this bill the way
 
01:48:01.960 --> 01:48:02.669 align:start position:0%
kill it and by passing this bill the way
it's

01:48:02.669 --> 01:48:02.679 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:48:05.669 --> 01:48:05.679 align:start position:0%
written is there's no incentive for the
 
01:48:07.229 --> 01:48:07.239 align:start position:0%
select board in the town to come and
 
01:48:08.589 --> 01:48:08.599 align:start position:0%
talk to us because they're getting out
 
01:48:11.510 --> 01:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
of it Britney of Scott Frey as Kevin
 
01:48:14.070 --> 01:48:14.080 align:start position:0%
just explained to you uh we can't live
 
01:48:16.350 --> 01:48:16.360 align:start position:0%
on that they'll be in the Town Road
 
01:48:18.870 --> 01:48:18.880 align:start position:0%
business and there's no way they can do
 
01:48:21.430 --> 01:48:21.440 align:start position:0%
it for what we're doing it for they say
 
01:48:23.629 --> 01:48:23.639 align:start position:0%
8 Miles well you know when you plow a
 
01:48:26.709 --> 01:48:26.719 align:start position:0%
road that doubles cuz you got to go both
 
01:48:28.550 --> 01:48:28.560 align:start position:0%
ways on that road to plow it so it's
 
01:48:31.070 --> 01:48:31.080 align:start position:0%
actually 16 mies and if you look at all
 
01:48:33.030 --> 01:48:33.040 align:start position:0%
the rest of the state as the Dr pointed
 
01:48:35.550 --> 01:48:35.560 align:start position:0%
out Town's the size of Woodsville are
 
01:48:38.109 --> 01:48:38.119 align:start position:0%
between $30 and $50 per square mile to
 
01:48:39.669 --> 01:48:39.679 align:start position:0%
do the roads because of the way they're
 
01:48:42.510 --> 01:48:42.520 align:start position:0%
constructed a t a town dirt road isn't
 
01:48:42.520 --> 01:48:43.430 align:start position:0%
constructed a t a town dirt road isn't
like

01:48:43.430 --> 01:48:43.440 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:48:46.270 --> 01:48:46.280 align:start position:0%
that this formula that's on this thing
 
01:48:49.550 --> 01:48:49.560 align:start position:0%
is based on the road Road M monies all
 
01:48:53.470 --> 01:48:53.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:56.990 --> 01:48:57.000 align:start position:0%

you Mr chair thank you for taking my my
 
01:49:26.790 --> 01:49:26.800 align:start position:0%
question um in listening to your
 
01:49:30.510 --> 01:49:30.520 align:start position:0%
testimony and the testimony of others
 
01:49:32.270 --> 01:49:32.280 align:start position:0%
that preceded
 
01:49:36.310 --> 01:49:36.320 align:start position:0%
you um I think it's fair to say that
 
01:49:39.950 --> 01:49:39.960 align:start position:0%
there is a lot of emotion and
 
01:49:44.189 --> 01:49:44.199 align:start position:0%
animosity between the parties my
 
01:49:44.199 --> 01:49:45.950 align:start position:0%
animosity between the parties my
question

01:49:45.950 --> 01:49:45.960 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:49:50.910 --> 01:49:50.920 align:start position:0%
um when the Supreme Court hands down its
 
01:49:55.629 --> 01:49:55.639 align:start position:0%
ruling whichever way the ruling goes do
 
01:49:59.109 --> 01:49:59.119 align:start position:0%
you feel that the parties are willing to
 
01:50:03.189 --> 01:50:03.199 align:start position:0%
accept that ruling or will the animosity
 
01:50:05.470 --> 01:50:05.480 align:start position:0%
continue I think it depends on which way
 
01:50:05.480 --> 01:50:06.189 align:start position:0%
continue I think it depends on which way
it

01:50:06.189 --> 01:50:06.199 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:50:09.870 --> 01:50:09.880 align:start position:0%
goes I really do because uh we had the
 
01:50:12.750 --> 01:50:12.760 align:start position:0%
same thing as Rick lad said back in uh
 
01:50:15.390 --> 01:50:15.400 align:start position:0%
1969 with the schools when they
 
01:50:17.790 --> 01:50:17.800 align:start position:0%
Consolidated Schools havil didn't want
 
01:50:19.790 --> 01:50:19.800 align:start position:0%
to give up their school but they wanted
 
01:50:22.270 --> 01:50:22.280 align:start position:0%
to come to Woodsville high school so we
 
01:50:23.470 --> 01:50:23.480 align:start position:0%
did a
 
01:50:27.430 --> 01:50:27.440 align:start position:0%
a Cooper Cooperative school district and
 
01:50:30.550 --> 01:50:30.560 align:start position:0%
over the years it's it's cooled down but
 
01:50:33.550 --> 01:50:33.560 align:start position:0%
uh this this whole thing I don't know if
 
01:50:35.950 --> 01:50:35.960 align:start position:0%
it'll ever cool down and like I say I've
 
01:50:40.390 --> 01:50:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:40.400 --> 01:50:42.750 align:start position:0%
 
years

01:50:42.750 --> 01:50:42.760 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:50:46.430 --> 01:50:46.440 align:start position:0%
the sentive power thank you Mr chairman
 
01:50:48.189 --> 01:50:48.199 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question sir
 
01:50:50.750 --> 01:50:50.760 align:start position:0%
I appreciate your um testimony here
 
01:50:53.390 --> 01:50:53.400 align:start position:0%
today so
 
01:50:55.870 --> 01:50:55.880 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that the Woodsville
 
01:50:59.870 --> 01:50:59.880 align:start position:0%
fire district is a village district and
 
01:51:02.629 --> 01:51:02.639 align:start position:0%
in statute we have 14 distinct purposes
 
01:51:05.510 --> 01:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
for which a village District can be
 
01:51:08.589 --> 01:51:08.599 align:start position:0%
formed um my understanding is that you
 
01:51:10.750 --> 01:51:10.760 align:start position:0%
are the commissioner of the Woodsville
 
01:51:13.270 --> 01:51:13.280 align:start position:0%
fire distri district and I keep asking
 
01:51:15.870 --> 01:51:15.880 align:start position:0%
the same question so I hope that you can
 
01:51:18.189 --> 01:51:18.199 align:start position:0%
help to set the record straight for me
 
01:51:20.990 --> 01:51:21.000 align:start position:0%
in my head could you please tell me for
 
01:51:25.470 --> 01:51:25.480 align:start position:0%
what purposes what 14
 
01:51:28.510 --> 01:51:28.520 align:start position:0%
purposes is the Woodsville fire district
 
01:51:31.470 --> 01:51:31.480 align:start position:0%
established for it was for for for water
 
01:51:35.310 --> 01:51:35.320 align:start position:0%
and Roads and today in 2024 it's just
 
01:51:38.550 --> 01:51:38.560 align:start position:0%
for those two distinct separate purposes
 
01:51:40.390 --> 01:51:40.400 align:start position:0%
that's what water and Roads that's what
 
01:51:42.510 --> 01:51:42.520 align:start position:0%
the precinct is but we also have
 
01:51:45.430 --> 01:51:45.440 align:start position:0%
Woodsville water and lights which is
 
01:51:47.669 --> 01:51:47.679 align:start position:0%
half of it and we also have an ambulance
 
01:51:49.910 --> 01:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
service we have the only sewer system in
 
01:51:51.910 --> 01:51:51.920 align:start position:0%
town which goes down to the county and
 
01:51:54.669 --> 01:51:54.679 align:start position:0%
down to the towns industrial park in
 
01:51:54.679 --> 01:51:57.830 align:start position:0%
down to the towns industrial park in
North

01:51:57.830 --> 01:51:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:01.430 --> 01:52:01.440 align:start position:0%
ail thank thank you forther
 
01:52:03.629 --> 01:52:03.639 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
01:52:07.589 --> 01:52:07.599 align:start position:0%
much for your testimony thank you uh
 
01:52:30.510 --> 01:52:30.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:33.310 --> 01:52:33.320 align:start position:0%
yes my name is Robert a
 
01:52:36.149 --> 01:52:36.159 align:start position:0%
massini uh my history in the town of
 
01:52:39.510 --> 01:52:39.520 align:start position:0%
havil is I served on the uh planning
 
01:52:42.510 --> 01:52:42.520 align:start position:0%
board for around 20 years The havil
 
01:52:44.870 --> 01:52:44.880 align:start position:0%
Cooperative school board for 18 years
 
01:52:47.510 --> 01:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
and the havil select board for around
 
01:52:47.520 --> 01:52:48.709 align:start position:0%
and the havil select board for around
nine

01:52:48.709 --> 01:52:48.719 align:start position:0%
nine
 
01:52:51.430 --> 01:52:51.440 align:start position:0%
years in all that
 
01:52:53.910 --> 01:52:53.920 align:start position:0%
time we've always been able to handle
 
01:52:56.350 --> 01:52:56.360 align:start position:0%
our own
 
01:52:56.360 --> 01:52:58.149 align:start position:0%
our own
problems

01:52:58.149 --> 01:52:58.159 align:start position:0%
problems
 
01:53:01.629 --> 01:53:01.639 align:start position:0%
and for some reason the uh State's
 
01:53:04.350 --> 01:53:04.360 align:start position:0%
formula to provide
 
01:53:08.990 --> 01:53:09.000 align:start position:0%
uh the roadways and Woodsville uh worked
 
01:53:13.430 --> 01:53:13.440 align:start position:0%
uh for over 130 years but uh when the
 
01:53:15.830 --> 01:53:15.840 align:start position:0%
new town manager came in I guess we
 
01:53:18.870 --> 01:53:18.880 align:start position:0%
discontinued that uh formula and
 
01:53:20.750 --> 01:53:20.760 align:start position:0%
everything's been in turmoil in the town
 
01:53:24.149 --> 01:53:24.159 align:start position:0%
of havil and Woodsville fire district
 
01:53:24.159 --> 01:53:25.270 align:start position:0%
of havil and Woodsville fire district
ever

01:53:25.270 --> 01:53:25.280 align:start position:0%
ever
 
01:53:28.990 --> 01:53:29.000 align:start position:0%
since also I didn't say my address is uh
 
01:53:33.030 --> 01:53:33.040 align:start position:0%
40 slave rid in uh havil corner I don't
 
01:53:33.910 --> 01:53:33.920 align:start position:0%
live in
 
01:53:38.510 --> 01:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
Woodsville so I'm opposed to the bill is
 
01:53:41.709 --> 01:53:41.719 align:start position:0%
as stands right now because it doesn't
 
01:53:41.719 --> 01:53:43.629 align:start position:0%
as stands right now because it doesn't
provide

01:53:43.629 --> 01:53:43.639 align:start position:0%
provide
 
01:53:46.790 --> 01:53:46.800 align:start position:0%
even level funding for what the cost of
 
01:53:49.149 --> 01:53:49.159 align:start position:0%
the roads in the fire department
 
01:53:51.229 --> 01:53:51.239 align:start position:0%
Woodville would
 
01:53:54.390 --> 01:53:54.400 align:start position:0%
be and and I remember in one of the
 
01:53:57.350 --> 01:53:57.360 align:start position:0%
Senate hearings the Bureau of Revenue
 
01:54:01.589 --> 01:54:01.599 align:start position:0%
Administration testified about uh four
 
01:54:04.310 --> 01:54:04.320 align:start position:0%
five or six communities similar to
 
01:54:06.270 --> 01:54:06.280 align:start position:0%
Woodville and what their per mileage
 
01:54:09.390 --> 01:54:09.400 align:start position:0%
cost would be and it vared from 20 odd
 
01:54:12.910 --> 01:54:12.920 align:start position:0%
th000 a mile to 50 odd th000 a mile
 
01:54:15.950 --> 01:54:15.960 align:start position:0%
average probably being someplace in the
 
01:54:20.149 --> 01:54:20.159 align:start position:0%
30s which comes closer to what
 
01:54:23.910 --> 01:54:23.920 align:start position:0%
uh what is costing Woods
 
01:54:28.229 --> 01:54:28.239 align:start position:0%
and again we always were able to handle
 
01:54:31.629 --> 01:54:31.639 align:start position:0%
things within the town itself for years
 
01:54:34.430 --> 01:54:34.440 align:start position:0%
and years and like I said the select
 
01:54:36.950 --> 01:54:36.960 align:start position:0%
board and the Commissioners got together
 
01:54:39.550 --> 01:54:39.560 align:start position:0%
and came up with a formula to fund the
 
01:54:43.189 --> 01:54:43.199 align:start position:0%
fire departments well since three or
 
01:54:44.669 --> 01:54:44.679 align:start position:0%
four years
 
01:54:48.350 --> 01:54:48.360 align:start position:0%
ago the town of havil doesn't fund wood
 
01:54:51.950 --> 01:54:51.960 align:start position:0%
fire department uh they they don't uh
 
01:54:55.790 --> 01:54:55.800 align:start position:0%
put a doar forward yet the village of
 
01:54:58.990 --> 01:54:59.000 align:start position:0%
Woodsville is paying over
 
01:55:02.069 --> 01:55:02.079 align:start position:0%
20% of the town's taxes including the
 
01:55:04.510 --> 01:55:04.520 align:start position:0%
havil fire department and the havil road
 
01:55:08.189 --> 01:55:08.199 align:start position:0%
department with no return to
 
01:55:10.790 --> 01:55:10.800 align:start position:0%
Woodsville I agree with Rick that
 
01:55:14.030 --> 01:55:14.040 align:start position:0%
probably this should uh a final decision
 
01:55:16.030 --> 01:55:16.040 align:start position:0%
on this should probably be postponed
 
01:55:19.109 --> 01:55:19.119 align:start position:0%
until after the uh Supreme Court cases
 
01:55:19.119 --> 01:55:19.950 align:start position:0%
until after the uh Supreme Court cases
are

01:55:19.950 --> 01:55:19.960 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:55:22.950 --> 01:55:22.960 align:start position:0%
decided but you still need to come up
 
01:55:25.589 --> 01:55:25.599 align:start position:0%
with a a middleof the road
 
01:55:30.390 --> 01:55:30.400 align:start position:0%
formula to get the funding back in place
 
01:55:32.350 --> 01:55:32.360 align:start position:0%
since since this has taken place there's
 
01:55:35.510 --> 01:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
been absolutely no initiative on the hav
 
01:55:37.910 --> 01:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
 of selectman to sit down with the
 
01:55:41.149 --> 01:55:41.159 align:start position:0%
Woodsville Commissioners and work it out
 
01:55:43.390 --> 01:55:43.400 align:start position:0%
and right's right and Wrongs wrong and
 
01:55:48.390 --> 01:55:48.400 align:start position:0%
fair is fair thank you thank
 
01:55:48.400 --> 01:55:50.709 align:start position:0%
fair is fair thank you thank
you

01:55:50.709 --> 01:55:50.719 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:55:53.709 --> 01:55:53.719 align:start position:0%
questions I see none thank you very much
 
01:55:57.149 --> 01:55:57.159 align:start position:0%
for your testimony
 
01:55:59.069 --> 01:55:59.079 align:start position:0%
um from the
 
01:56:01.589 --> 01:56:01.599 align:start position:0%
Dr can we have just one of you come up
 
01:56:03.790 --> 01:56:03.800 align:start position:0%
or is it imperative you have both
 
01:56:08.950 --> 01:56:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:11.069 --> 01:56:11.079 align:start position:0%
here I'm assuming you're going to say
 
01:56:15.510 --> 01:56:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:19.510 --> 01:56:19.520 align:start position:0%
so okay I guess we believe we need both
 
01:56:23.589 --> 01:56:23.599 align:start position:0%
uh and Roth
 
01:56:26.830 --> 01:56:26.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:29.189 --> 01:56:29.199 align:start position:0%
team good morning Mr chairman members of
 
01:56:31.870 --> 01:56:31.880 align:start position:0%

an attorney with the Department of
 
01:56:41.189 --> 01:56:41.199 align:start position:0%
Revenue Administration I've been
 
01:56:43.550 --> 01:56:43.560 align:start position:0%
involved in the matters between
 
01:56:47.350 --> 01:56:47.360 align:start position:0%
Woodsville and haal since approximately
 
01:56:51.750 --> 01:56:51.760 align:start position:0%
2019 including the um issues that are
 
01:56:53.990 --> 01:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
now in front front of the Supreme Court
 
01:56:56.430 --> 01:56:56.440 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:56:58.790 --> 01:56:58.800 align:start position:0%
the this bill that's in front of the
 
01:57:01.270 --> 01:57:01.280 align:start position:0%
legislature now and how it its Origins
 
01:57:03.350 --> 01:57:03.360 align:start position:0%
and I can answer any questions about
 
01:57:06.589 --> 01:57:06.599 align:start position:0%
that if you wish um with respect to the
 
01:57:09.109 --> 01:57:09.119 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court to well first I should
 
01:57:11.550 --> 01:57:11.560 align:start position:0%
introduce uh my name is Adam donon core
 
01:57:12.750 --> 01:57:12.760 align:start position:0%
I'm the assistant director of the
 
01:57:14.189 --> 01:57:14.199 align:start position:0%
municipal and property division at the
 
01:57:23.589 --> 01:57:23.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:25.790 --> 01:57:25.800 align:start position:0%
so the the the case was argued to the
 
01:57:27.950 --> 01:57:27.960 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court at the beginning of
 
01:57:30.990 --> 01:57:31.000 align:start position:0%
January and we're expecting a decision
 
01:57:34.109 --> 01:57:34.119 align:start position:0%
really at any point I check the docket
 
01:57:36.709 --> 01:57:36.719 align:start position:0%
literally every day to see what the
 
01:57:40.629 --> 01:57:40.639 align:start position:0%
decision is um
 
01:57:43.430 --> 01:57:43.440 align:start position:0%
the case was argued to the Supreme Court
 
01:57:46.149 --> 01:57:46.159 align:start position:0%
really sort of in two different ways the
 
01:57:48.589 --> 01:57:48.599 align:start position:0%
Woodsville argued the case as sort of a
 
01:57:51.550 --> 01:57:51.560 align:start position:0%
larger question about whether the
 
01:57:53.550 --> 01:57:53.560 align:start position:0%
warrant IAL approach that was in the
 
01:57:57.030 --> 01:57:57.040 align:start position:0%
2021 legislation ought to be followed
 
01:57:59.350 --> 01:57:59.360 align:start position:0%
which was the basis for its appeal to
 
01:58:01.069 --> 01:58:01.079 align:start position:0%
the Department of Revenue Administration
 
01:58:03.430 --> 01:58:03.440 align:start position:0%
over hail's tax rate and I know that's
 
01:58:06.109 --> 01:58:06.119 align:start position:0%
kind of confusing the department through
 
01:58:07.950 --> 01:58:07.960 align:start position:0%
the Department of Justice argued to the
 
01:58:10.390 --> 01:58:10.400 align:start position:0%
court that the case should be decided on
 
01:58:13.550 --> 01:58:13.560 align:start position:0%
a very narrow basis of jurisdiction and
 
01:58:17.149 --> 01:58:17.159 align:start position:0%
that is the uh the timing for
 
01:58:20.069 --> 01:58:20.079 align:start position:0%
woodville's appeal was not correct and
 
01:58:22.510 --> 01:58:22.520 align:start position:0%
Woodsville did not have standing to to
 
01:58:25.310 --> 01:58:25.320 align:start position:0%
appeal the tax rate that was assigned to
 
01:58:28.310 --> 01:58:28.320 align:start position:0%
the uh to the town of hail Woodsville
 
01:58:30.629 --> 01:58:30.639 align:start position:0%
could have appealed its own tax rate but
 
01:58:33.550 --> 01:58:33.560 align:start position:0%
it didn't and instead it appealed hail's
 
01:58:37.270 --> 01:58:37.280 align:start position:0%
tax rate so it's our expectation and
 
01:58:39.550 --> 01:58:39.560 align:start position:0%
belief that the Supreme Court will and
 
01:58:41.430 --> 01:58:41.440 align:start position:0%
should anyway decide the matter on a
 
01:58:43.990 --> 01:58:44.000 align:start position:0%
narrower jurisdictional basis that
 
01:58:47.910 --> 01:58:47.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't really help move the pieces any
 
01:58:50.830 --> 01:58:50.840 align:start position:0%
further on the board to get us to you
 
01:58:52.350 --> 01:58:52.360 align:start position:0%
know sort of a resolution of what's
 
01:58:55.149 --> 01:58:55.159 align:start position:0%
going on here but one of the things that
 
01:58:57.550 --> 01:58:57.560 align:start position:0%
we discovered in looking at the the
 
01:58:59.669 --> 01:58:59.679 align:start position:0%
legislation and I I studied the
 
01:59:03.350 --> 01:59:03.360 align:start position:0%
legislation back to 1880 something and
 
01:59:04.990 --> 01:59:05.000 align:start position:0%
and the most current version which was
 
01:59:08.470 --> 01:59:08.480 align:start position:0%
put forth by Senator GAA in 2021 but
 
01:59:10.229 --> 01:59:10.239 align:start position:0%
also previously in
 
01:59:14.470 --> 01:59:14.480 align:start position:0%
2020 was to create this sort of I think
 
01:59:16.189 --> 01:59:16.199 align:start position:0%
everybody believed anyway that two
 
01:59:18.270 --> 01:59:18.280 align:start position:0%
things were going to happen one the
 
01:59:20.430 --> 01:59:20.440 align:start position:0%
parties that is hail and Woodsville
 
01:59:23.589 --> 01:59:23.599 align:start position:0%
would talk that didn't Happ happen but
 
01:59:25.669 --> 01:59:25.679 align:start position:0%
it was also the belief that the IDE I
 
01:59:29.350 --> 01:59:29.360 align:start position:0%
think the idea was to separate the the
 
01:59:32.510 --> 01:59:32.520 align:start position:0%
sort of interwined of the two
 
01:59:34.990 --> 01:59:35.000 align:start position:0%
entities there was left in the in the
 
01:59:38.790 --> 01:59:38.800 align:start position:0%
legislation in 2021 the ability for the
 
01:59:42.790 --> 01:59:42.800 align:start position:0%
voters at town meeting to put forth
 
01:59:44.870 --> 01:59:44.880 align:start position:0%
warrant articles and so there's a
 
01:59:48.510 --> 01:59:48.520 align:start position:0%
dispute about what that meant and um
 
01:59:51.149 --> 01:59:51.159 align:start position:0%
Senator GAA believed and there's there's
 
01:59:53.390 --> 01:59:53.400 align:start position:0%
there's a letter to to that effect that
 
01:59:57.109 --> 01:59:57.119 align:start position:0%
this was a very narrow way for uh hail
 
01:59:59.430 --> 01:59:59.440 align:start position:0%
to fund certain programs that Woodsville
 
02:00:01.550 --> 02:00:01.560 align:start position:0%
was carrying on on hail's behalf and I
 
02:00:03.229 --> 02:00:03.239 align:start position:0%
believe the ambulance service was one of
 
02:00:04.990 --> 02:00:05.000 align:start position:0%
them maybe the library I'm not sure
 
02:00:07.510 --> 02:00:07.520 align:start position:0%
exactly what they were but what it what
 
02:00:10.270 --> 02:00:10.280 align:start position:0%
happened instead is at the town meeting
 
02:00:10.280 --> 02:00:11.030 align:start position:0%
happened instead is at the town meeting
in

02:00:11.030 --> 02:00:11.040 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:00:15.390 --> 02:00:15.400 align:start position:0%
2022 the uh Woodsville people
 
02:00:17.669 --> 02:00:17.679 align:start position:0%
essentially showed up and for the
 
02:00:20.189 --> 02:00:20.199 align:start position:0%
meeting and the weather was poor and
 
02:00:23.189 --> 02:00:23.199 align:start position:0%
there was covid concerns at that time
 
02:00:26.030 --> 02:00:26.040 align:start position:0%
and so they put through warrant articles
 
02:00:28.310 --> 02:00:28.320 align:start position:0%
funding both the fire department and the
 
02:00:29.830 --> 02:00:29.840 align:start position:0%
road department in
 
02:00:32.470 --> 02:00:32.480 align:start position:0%
full and there's some dispute about what
 
02:00:34.709 --> 02:00:34.719 align:start position:0%
those numbers should have been but
 
02:00:38.069 --> 02:00:38.079 align:start position:0%
that's what sort of sort of started this
 
02:00:41.430 --> 02:00:41.440 align:start position:0%
most recent version of the problem the
 
02:00:44.229 --> 02:00:44.239 align:start position:0%
the current bill that was started off by
 
02:00:46.750 --> 02:00:46.760 align:start position:0%
Senator gray to resolve the ambiguity
 
02:00:48.990 --> 02:00:49.000 align:start position:0%
that was believed in the statute about
 
02:00:51.069 --> 02:00:51.079 align:start position:0%
what those L those words were intended
 
02:00:52.470 --> 02:00:52.480 align:start position:0%
to accomplish
 
02:00:54.470 --> 02:00:54.480 align:start position:0%
was it a narrower view as Senator GAA
 
02:00:56.629 --> 02:00:56.639 align:start position:0%
felt or was it just open-ended because
 
02:00:58.550 --> 02:00:58.560 align:start position:0%
right now the way it's written it's kind
 
02:01:00.390 --> 02:01:00.400 align:start position:0%
of an open-ended invitation for people
 
02:01:04.069 --> 02:01:04.079 align:start position:0%
to come to the town meeting and vote for
 
02:01:06.870 --> 02:01:06.880 align:start position:0%
Appropriations for
 
02:01:09.270 --> 02:01:09.280 align:start position:0%
Woodsville the issue that come that this
 
02:01:12.750 --> 02:01:12.760 align:start position:0%
sort of sits on top of I think is that
 
02:01:15.310 --> 02:01:15.320 align:start position:0%
Village districts and fire districts are
 
02:01:17.189 --> 02:01:17.199 align:start position:0%
intended to be essentially
 
02:01:19.229 --> 02:01:19.239 align:start position:0%
self-supporting through either fees that
 
02:01:21.270 --> 02:01:21.280 align:start position:0%
they charge their residents for what the
 
02:01:23.310 --> 02:01:23.320 align:start position:0%
services that they provide or through
 
02:01:26.470 --> 02:01:26.480 align:start position:0%
their own forms of Taxation and so the
 
02:01:29.870 --> 02:01:29.880 align:start position:0%
idea that this the taxpayers of haal
 
02:01:32.830 --> 02:01:32.840 align:start position:0%
would be essentially subsidizing the
 
02:01:35.189 --> 02:01:35.199 align:start position:0%
programs that this The Village District
 
02:01:39.589 --> 02:01:39.599 align:start position:0%
in uh Woodsville is sort of contrary to
 
02:01:42.510 --> 02:01:42.520 align:start position:0%
that General principle and to answer the
 
02:01:45.790 --> 02:01:45.800 align:start position:0%
the representative's question what is uh
 
02:01:45.800 --> 02:01:47.310 align:start position:0%
the representative's question what is uh
Woodsville

02:01:47.310 --> 02:01:47.320 align:start position:0%
Woodsville
 
02:01:50.030 --> 02:01:50.040 align:start position:0%
um Woodsville was formed as a fire
 
02:01:53.390 --> 02:01:53.400 align:start position:0%
district under like an 18 50 law and
 
02:01:55.390 --> 02:01:55.400 align:start position:0%
then it had additional amendments that
 
02:01:57.470 --> 02:01:57.480 align:start position:0%
were added to it to give it additional
 
02:01:59.750 --> 02:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
powers and to make it a little more
 
02:02:01.790 --> 02:02:01.800 align:start position:0%
complicated they do
 
02:02:04.310 --> 02:02:04.320 align:start position:0%
things that they've developed over the
 
02:02:06.390 --> 02:02:06.400 align:start position:0%
years that are not really fully
 
02:02:09.350 --> 02:02:09.360 align:start position:0%
explained by the the session laws that
 
02:02:12.910 --> 02:02:12.920 align:start position:0%
were enacted to form it and Empower it
 
02:02:15.510 --> 02:02:15.520 align:start position:0%
and so I think Senator Gray's idea in
 
02:02:17.629 --> 02:02:17.639 align:start position:0%
this bill was to essentially make
 
02:02:20.189 --> 02:02:20.199 align:start position:0%
Woodsville like every other Village
 
02:02:23.149 --> 02:02:23.159 align:start position:0%
District but the when he started with
 
02:02:25.470 --> 02:02:25.480 align:start position:0%
that what he learned from the parties
 
02:02:27.350 --> 02:02:27.360 align:start position:0%
and from Woodsville and from hail was
 
02:02:28.790 --> 02:02:28.800 align:start position:0%
that there is still this
 
02:02:31.229 --> 02:02:31.239 align:start position:0%
interconnectedness in terms of funding
 
02:02:33.069 --> 02:02:33.079 align:start position:0%
and the idea that he came up with this
 
02:02:36.990 --> 02:02:37.000 align:start position:0%
formula as I observed it was to make it
 
02:02:38.990 --> 02:02:39.000 align:start position:0%
so that the fact that Woodsville people
 
02:02:41.750 --> 02:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
are paying taxes to the town of Hao for
 
02:02:44.310 --> 02:02:44.320 align:start position:0%
services that Woodsville is essentially
 
02:02:47.790 --> 02:02:47.800 align:start position:0%
providing itself that is fire and Roads
 
02:02:49.589 --> 02:02:49.599 align:start position:0%
that there should be some kind of an
 
02:02:52.830 --> 02:02:52.840 align:start position:0%
offset so that Woods people aren't
 
02:02:55.990 --> 02:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
paying essentially double and so his
 
02:02:58.750 --> 02:02:58.760 align:start position:0%
formula here was attended to accomplish
 
02:03:02.589 --> 02:03:02.599 align:start position:0%
a sort of a rough justice of that and I
 
02:03:04.350 --> 02:03:04.360 align:start position:0%
I guess that's all I I have to say about
 
02:03:05.790 --> 02:03:05.800 align:start position:0%
it I'm happy to take any questions and I
 
02:03:07.030 --> 02:03:07.040 align:start position:0%
don't know if Adam has anything in
 
02:03:07.040 --> 02:03:09.030 align:start position:0%
don't know if Adam has anything in
addition

02:03:09.030 --> 02:03:09.040 align:start position:0%
addition
 
02:03:12.149 --> 02:03:12.159 align:start position:0%
question representative Guthrie thank
 
02:03:14.550 --> 02:03:14.560 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you for taking my
 
02:03:18.990 --> 02:03:19.000 align:start position:0%
question uh could you tell me there each
 
02:03:22.830 --> 02:03:22.840 align:start position:0%
entity that is involved in this I still
 
02:03:25.030 --> 02:03:25.040 align:start position:0%
understand I think there's either
 
02:03:28.270 --> 02:03:28.280 align:start position:0%
there's either five or six do they all
 
02:03:31.430 --> 02:03:31.440 align:start position:0%
have a separate tax
 
02:03:34.550 --> 02:03:34.560 align:start position:0%
rate yeah so each each Village District
 
02:03:38.390 --> 02:03:38.400 align:start position:0%
in Hil gets their they pay taxes to hail
 
02:03:39.830 --> 02:03:39.840 align:start position:0%
and they also have a village District
 
02:03:43.629 --> 02:03:43.639 align:start position:0%
tax rate wow so if they're appropriating
 
02:03:45.430 --> 02:03:45.440 align:start position:0%
on their own for their own purposes
 
02:03:47.709 --> 02:03:47.719 align:start position:0%
they'll pay a tax rate based on those
 
02:03:50.189 --> 02:03:50.199 align:start position:0%
Appropriations but they also pay as
 
02:03:52.430 --> 02:03:52.440 align:start position:0%
they're also residents of the town of
 
02:03:55.350 --> 02:03:55.360 align:start position:0%
April follow up Mr chairman if I could
 
02:03:58.870 --> 02:03:58.880 align:start position:0%
yeah go ahead thank you uh does that
 
02:04:00.750 --> 02:04:00.760 align:start position:0%
that mean they each have their own
 
02:04:03.069 --> 02:04:03.079 align:start position:0%
budget that's correct they have their
 
02:04:05.069 --> 02:04:05.079 align:start position:0%
own governing body they have their own
 
02:04:07.750 --> 02:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
budget legislative body they're little
 
02:04:09.990 --> 02:04:10.000 align:start position:0%
little tiny versions of towns that are
 
02:04:11.629 --> 02:04:11.639 align:start position:0%
established for a specific purpose or
 
02:04:12.510 --> 02:04:12.520 align:start position:0%
set of
 
02:04:15.350 --> 02:04:15.360 align:start position:0%
purposes thank you thank you Mr
 
02:04:18.589 --> 02:04:18.599 align:start position:0%
chairman representative priest thank you
 
02:04:20.669 --> 02:04:20.679 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thank you for taking my
 
02:04:24.430 --> 02:04:24.440 align:start position:0%
questions what I'm hearing is that H the
 
02:04:27.470 --> 02:04:27.480 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 448 would just make the
 
02:04:30.310 --> 02:04:30.320 align:start position:0%
situation even more complex and
 
02:04:33.109 --> 02:04:33.119 align:start position:0%
problematic and it would not resolve the
 
02:04:36.589 --> 02:04:36.599 align:start position:0%
issues that are confronting the villages
 
02:04:40.870 --> 02:04:40.880 align:start position:0%
and the town of haill is that
 
02:04:44.189 --> 02:04:44.199 align:start position:0%
correct I think the purpose of the of
 
02:04:46.350 --> 02:04:46.360 align:start position:0%
the bill in its current form was to
 
02:04:46.360 --> 02:04:47.870 align:start position:0%
the bill in its current form was to
replace

02:04:47.870 --> 02:04:47.880 align:start position:0%
replace
 
02:04:51.109 --> 02:04:51.119 align:start position:0%
the um funding by Warren article that
 
02:04:52.310 --> 02:04:52.320 align:start position:0%
can be
 
02:04:54.109 --> 02:04:54.119 align:start position:0%
dependent on a lot of different factors
 
02:04:58.790 --> 02:04:58.800 align:start position:0%
and is a little bit um uh strange with a
 
02:05:01.390 --> 02:05:01.400 align:start position:0%
more set and standard Financial
 
02:05:03.589 --> 02:05:03.599 align:start position:0%
agreement that could also be uh
 
02:05:05.709 --> 02:05:05.719 align:start position:0%
supplanted by an actual agreement
 
02:05:07.510 --> 02:05:07.520 align:start position:0%
between the two parties so I think the
 
02:05:10.310 --> 02:05:10.320 align:start position:0%
idea here was to establish uh Woodsville
 
02:05:12.109 --> 02:05:12.119 align:start position:0%
as a village District just as every
 
02:05:13.870 --> 02:05:13.880 align:start position:0%
other Village District in the state is
 
02:05:15.790 --> 02:05:15.800 align:start position:0%
and replace their kind of unorthodox
 
02:05:18.470 --> 02:05:18.480 align:start position:0%
system uh with something that's more
 
02:05:22.990 --> 02:05:23.000 align:start position:0%
standardized as a followup Mr chairman
 
02:05:26.430 --> 02:05:26.440 align:start position:0%
thank you again um with this
 
02:05:29.910 --> 02:05:29.920 align:start position:0%
legislation and the pending Supreme
 
02:05:29.920 --> 02:05:31.709 align:start position:0%
legislation and the pending Supreme
Court

02:05:31.709 --> 02:05:31.719 align:start position:0%
Court
 
02:05:34.910 --> 02:05:34.920 align:start position:0%
decision depending upon which way it
 
02:05:38.669 --> 02:05:38.679 align:start position:0%
goes we would be seeing you again at
 
02:05:38.679 --> 02:05:39.790 align:start position:0%
goes we would be seeing you again at
another

02:05:39.790 --> 02:05:39.800 align:start position:0%
another
 
02:05:43.950 --> 02:05:43.960 align:start position:0%
legislation uh year to on another bill
 
02:05:49.790 --> 02:05:49.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:52.149 --> 02:05:52.159 align:start position:0%
problem I don't know the answer to that
 
02:05:57.549 --> 02:05:57.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:01.109 --> 02:06:01.119 align:start position:0%
sorry representative power thank you Mr
 
02:06:02.510 --> 02:06:02.520 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
02:06:05.629 --> 02:06:05.639 align:start position:0%
question so we know and we understand
 
02:06:07.229 --> 02:06:07.239 align:start position:0%
according to statute that Village
 
02:06:09.910 --> 02:06:09.920 align:start position:0%
districts are established for a specific
 
02:06:11.990 --> 02:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
purpose and that they have the power and
 
02:06:14.870 --> 02:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
the authority to tax to fund those
 
02:06:17.549 --> 02:06:17.559 align:start position:0%
purposes so my question is are there any
 
02:06:19.870 --> 02:06:19.880 align:start position:0%
other examples of Village districts that
 
02:06:21.950 --> 02:06:21.960 align:start position:0%
are established
 
02:06:25.189 --> 02:06:25.199 align:start position:0%
in which the funding is
 
02:06:28.910 --> 02:06:28.920 align:start position:0%
not from within that Village districts
 
02:06:33.310 --> 02:06:33.320 align:start position:0%
either all or part maybe not all is
 
02:06:33.320 --> 02:06:34.709 align:start position:0%
either all or part maybe not all is
probably

02:06:34.709 --> 02:06:34.719 align:start position:0%
probably
 
02:06:36.709 --> 02:06:36.719 align:start position:0%
inappropriate are there other Village
 
02:06:38.990 --> 02:06:39.000 align:start position:0%
districts where part of the funding for
 
02:06:40.549 --> 02:06:40.559 align:start position:0%
the purpose of which that Village
 
02:06:43.069 --> 02:06:43.079 align:start position:0%
District was established comes
 
02:06:46.390 --> 02:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
from the town in which the the greater
 
02:06:49.270 --> 02:06:49.280 align:start position:0%
town in which the village district is
 
02:06:52.790 --> 02:06:52.800 align:start position:0%
part of I can say terms of a warrant
 
02:06:55.549 --> 02:06:55.559 align:start position:0%
article directly to fund a a village
 
02:06:58.270 --> 02:06:58.280 align:start position:0%
District purpose that's not something
 
02:07:01.669 --> 02:07:01.679 align:start position:0%
that we see in any other
 
02:07:04.990 --> 02:07:05.000 align:start position:0%
place but the there may be instances
 
02:07:07.109 --> 02:07:07.119 align:start position:0%
where there are specific sort of
 
02:07:09.589 --> 02:07:09.599 align:start position:0%
contractual relationships between them
 
02:07:15.030 --> 02:07:15.040 align:start position:0%
over specific programs or uh things that
 
02:07:20.270 --> 02:07:20.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:24.109 --> 02:07:24.119 align:start position:0%
lales thank thank you for the edif
 
02:07:26.350 --> 02:07:26.360 align:start position:0%
edification of my colleagues I'd just
 
02:07:29.549 --> 02:07:29.559 align:start position:0%
like to say that Woodsville is well
 
02:07:31.430 --> 02:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
known throughout the state for their
 
02:07:34.709 --> 02:07:34.719 align:start position:0%
softball team they have won the state
 
02:07:37.669 --> 02:07:37.679 align:start position:0%
championship two of the last three years
 
02:07:39.830 --> 02:07:39.840 align:start position:0%
for their division and they are
 
02:07:42.629 --> 02:07:42.639 align:start position:0%
currently undefeated so I would hope
 
02:07:44.669 --> 02:07:44.679 align:start position:0%
that whatever happens with this
 
02:07:48.709 --> 02:07:48.719 align:start position:0%
legislation that that that doesn't
 
02:07:52.310 --> 02:07:52.320 align:start position:0%
change that Woodsville will always be
 
02:07:55.149 --> 02:07:55.159 align:start position:0%
proud of their softball
 
02:08:01.270 --> 02:08:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:06.310 --> 02:08:06.320 align:start position:0%
you uh okay uh are there any more
 
02:08:09.030 --> 02:08:09.040 align:start position:0%
questions regarding the legislation
 
02:08:11.549 --> 02:08:11.559 align:start position:0%
representative power thank you Mr
 
02:08:13.589 --> 02:08:13.599 align:start position:0%
chairman I had a followup to my previous
 
02:08:16.470 --> 02:08:16.480 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for taking my
 
02:08:19.990 --> 02:08:20.000 align:start position:0%
followup so following up to my what I
 
02:08:21.950 --> 02:08:21.960 align:start position:0%
had asked before I was
 
02:08:24.589 --> 02:08:24.599 align:start position:0%
what I would like to ask is with regards
 
02:08:26.790 --> 02:08:26.800 align:start position:0%
to Village districts are there any
 
02:08:30.390 --> 02:08:30.400 align:start position:0%
statutes which prescribe a formula for
 
02:08:34.229 --> 02:08:34.239 align:start position:0%
funding similar to what was previously
 
02:08:36.549 --> 02:08:36.559 align:start position:0%
in statute which was repealed and now
 
02:08:39.189 --> 02:08:39.199 align:start position:0%
that we see here and with this bill
 
02:08:49.629 --> 02:08:49.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:53.830 --> 02:08:53.840 align:start position:0%
seen yes represent sen of Tetro go
 
02:08:57.910 --> 02:08:57.920 align:start position:0%
ahead you're hard to see down there I'm
 
02:08:57.920 --> 02:08:59.910 align:start position:0%
ahead you're hard to see down there I'm
sorry

02:08:59.910 --> 02:08:59.920 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
02:09:02.990 --> 02:09:03.000 align:start position:0%
never um thank you Mr chairman and
 
02:09:06.910 --> 02:09:06.920 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking our questions
 
02:09:10.310 --> 02:09:10.320 align:start position:0%
I'm having a hard time
 
02:09:10.320 --> 02:09:12.950 align:start position:0%
I'm having a hard time
wondering

02:09:12.950 --> 02:09:12.960 align:start position:0%
wondering
 
02:09:16.310 --> 02:09:16.320 align:start position:0%
why it it seems though each Town's
 
02:09:20.750 --> 02:09:20.760 align:start position:0%
trying to do their own thing and can't
 
02:09:25.069 --> 02:09:25.079 align:start position:0%
get together on how you fund it but
 
02:09:27.270 --> 02:09:27.280 align:start position:0%
there's plenty of examples throughout
 
02:09:30.790 --> 02:09:30.800 align:start position:0%
the state for the mutual Aid systems why
 
02:09:34.990 --> 02:09:35.000 align:start position:0%
why can't you work it out that way um I
 
02:09:38.310 --> 02:09:38.320 align:start position:0%
mean we've gone so far as not only fire
 
02:09:41.910 --> 02:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
we've got um Public Works Mutual Aid
 
02:09:44.470 --> 02:09:44.480 align:start position:0%
systems you know Police Department
 
02:09:49.470 --> 02:09:49.480 align:start position:0%
Mutual Aid System why can't you follow
 
02:09:54.669 --> 02:09:54.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:56.750 --> 02:09:56.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um that's not
 
02:09:58.629 --> 02:09:58.639 align:start position:0%
something that the Department of Revenue
 
02:10:03.310 --> 02:10:03.320 align:start position:0%
has any control over um the relationship
 
02:10:06.870 --> 02:10:06.880 align:start position:0%
between Woodsville and holl is kind of
 
02:10:08.790 --> 02:10:08.800 align:start position:0%
their business and I think that that you
 
02:10:10.549 --> 02:10:10.559 align:start position:0%
know from my perspective that's an
 
02:10:13.229 --> 02:10:13.239 align:start position:0%
excellent point to be made to them but
 
02:10:16.430 --> 02:10:16.440 align:start position:0%
that's not something that the Dr has any
 
02:10:20.189 --> 02:10:20.199 align:start position:0%
uh particular um power over or uh means
 
02:10:22.750 --> 02:10:22.760 align:start position:0%
of putting in place
 
02:10:26.189 --> 02:10:26.199 align:start position:0%
Place representative stavis thank you Mr
 
02:10:28.350 --> 02:10:28.360 align:start position:0%
chair very very quickly because I think
 
02:10:30.589 --> 02:10:30.599 align:start position:0%
I may have missed this at when you first
 
02:10:33.030 --> 02:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
sat down are you in support of or
 
02:10:35.229 --> 02:10:35.239 align:start position:0%
against this
 
02:10:37.709 --> 02:10:37.719 align:start position:0%
bill we we don't take a position on the
 
02:10:40.189 --> 02:10:40.199 align:start position:0%
bill itself I'm sorry we're but we're
 
02:10:41.549 --> 02:10:41.559 align:start position:0%
we've been working we worked with
 
02:10:45.910 --> 02:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
Senator gray during the the formula to
 
02:10:48.950 --> 02:10:48.960 align:start position:0%
provide information and insight about uh
 
02:10:51.589 --> 02:10:51.599 align:start position:0%
the economics and and the law and that's
 
02:10:54.910 --> 02:10:54.920 align:start position:0%
what we've been trying to do here
 
02:10:58.990 --> 02:10:59.000 align:start position:0%
today follow up yet Dr does not
 
02:11:01.870 --> 02:11:01.880 align:start position:0%
typically come up with spending formulas
 
02:11:04.430 --> 02:11:04.440 align:start position:0%
or taxing formulas for Village districts
 
02:11:07.950 --> 02:11:07.960 align:start position:0%
is that correct that's
 
02:11:10.629 --> 02:11:10.639 align:start position:0%
correct further
 
02:11:13.390 --> 02:11:13.400 align:start position:0%
questions I see none thank you gentlemen
 
02:11:16.069 --> 02:11:16.079 align:start position:0%
for your testimony last but not least
 
02:11:28.430 --> 02:11:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:30.390 --> 02:11:30.400 align:start position:0%
good morning it's still morning my name
 
02:11:32.870 --> 02:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
is Lindsay NATO I am an attorney at Orin
 
02:11:35.229 --> 02:11:35.239 align:start position:0%
Reno just down the street um and we
 
02:11:37.270 --> 02:11:37.280 align:start position:0%
represent the Woodsville fire district
 
02:11:39.189 --> 02:11:39.199 align:start position:0%
in various legal matters and that's how
 
02:11:41.910 --> 02:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
we became aware of this piece of
 
02:11:44.069 --> 02:11:44.079 align:start position:0%
legislation um I want to reiterate that
 
02:11:45.790 --> 02:11:45.800 align:start position:0%
Woodsville similar to many of you would
 
02:11:47.390 --> 02:11:47.400 align:start position:0%
like to never have to be back here ever
 
02:11:50.629 --> 02:11:50.639 align:start position:0%
again that's I think Universal um we are
 
02:11:52.709 --> 02:11:52.719 align:start position:0%
here once again because the town of hail
 
02:11:54.510 --> 02:11:54.520 align:start position:0%
keeps bringing legislation to try to
 
02:11:56.750 --> 02:11:56.760 align:start position:0%
change the playing field and so I think
 
02:11:58.510 --> 02:11:58.520 align:start position:0%
we appreciate the work that the Senate
 
02:12:01.510 --> 02:12:01.520 align:start position:0%
did trying to introduce amendments to
 
02:12:03.950 --> 02:12:03.960 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 448 that would make the
 
02:12:06.149 --> 02:12:06.159 align:start position:0%
playing field a bit more equal but we
 
02:12:07.830 --> 02:12:07.840 align:start position:0%
don't feel like it actually achieved
 
02:12:10.149 --> 02:12:10.159 align:start position:0%
that and so I think as Kevin um Shelton
 
02:12:12.109 --> 02:12:12.119 align:start position:0%
the T the district administrator stated
 
02:12:14.549 --> 02:12:14.559 align:start position:0%
earlier we do have two changes that we
 
02:12:16.750 --> 02:12:16.760 align:start position:0%
would suggest to add back in capital
 
02:12:19.430 --> 02:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
projects and to make the um fire
 
02:12:23.149 --> 02:12:23.159 align:start position:0%
calculation of per capita bis um to help
 
02:12:24.910 --> 02:12:24.920 align:start position:0%
even the playing field so that both
 
02:12:27.430 --> 02:12:27.440 align:start position:0%
parties do have incentive in a perfect
 
02:12:28.830 --> 02:12:28.840 align:start position:0%
world if they can come together and come
 
02:12:30.750 --> 02:12:30.760 align:start position:0%
to agreement I think that's the only way
 
02:12:32.510 --> 02:12:32.520 align:start position:0%
to really get them there so if you are
 
02:12:33.990 --> 02:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
interested in moving forward with
 
02:12:36.189 --> 02:12:36.199 align:start position:0%
legislation we would suggest making
 
02:12:37.270 --> 02:12:37.280 align:start position:0%
those two
 
02:12:39.549 --> 02:12:39.559 align:start position:0%
changes I'm going to answer a couple
 
02:12:41.990 --> 02:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
quick questions um knowing that I stand
 
02:12:43.950 --> 02:12:43.960 align:start position:0%
between you and your executive session
 
02:12:47.030 --> 02:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
and lunch um so representative power you
 
02:12:49.189 --> 02:12:49.199 align:start position:0%
had asked essentially what is Woodsville
 
02:12:51.229 --> 02:12:51.239 align:start position:0%
it's established in session laws so it's
 
02:12:53.950 --> 02:12:53.960 align:start position:0%
currently not in the rsas and so part of
 
02:12:56.589 --> 02:12:56.599 align:start position:0%
what Senator gray tried to do was put it
 
02:12:59.870 --> 02:12:59.880 align:start position:0%
into the rsas so that it was um easier
 
02:13:03.750 --> 02:13:03.760 align:start position:0%
to follow basically um so that's how it
 
02:13:07.589 --> 02:13:07.599 align:start position:0%
is it does have under you'll see um
 
02:13:10.149 --> 02:13:10.159 align:start position:0%
chapter 52 Village districts there are a
 
02:13:12.270 --> 02:13:12.280 align:start position:0%
bunch of different purposes for which V
 
02:13:14.709 --> 02:13:14.719 align:start position:0%
Village districts can be created it
 
02:13:17.189 --> 02:13:17.199 align:start position:0%
originally was created for extinguishing
 
02:13:19.589 --> 02:13:19.599 align:start position:0%
fires it has over the years been
 
02:13:22.830 --> 02:13:22.840 align:start position:0%
expanded um and it basically includes
 
02:13:26.109 --> 02:13:26.119 align:start position:0%
most except for two um of the purposes
 
02:13:29.270 --> 02:13:29.280 align:start position:0%
that are established in RSA 521 so it is
 
02:13:31.149 --> 02:13:31.159 align:start position:0%
pretty broad which is why we get into
 
02:13:32.709 --> 02:13:32.719 align:start position:0%
these issues about it looking like its
 
02:13:35.470 --> 02:13:35.480 align:start position:0%
own town even though it is part of the
 
02:13:36.950 --> 02:13:36.960 align:start position:0%
overall haval
 
02:13:38.950 --> 02:13:38.960 align:start position:0%
Community I think one thing that gets
 
02:13:41.229 --> 02:13:41.239 align:start position:0%
lost is that Woodsville fire district
 
02:13:43.750 --> 02:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
residents are also hail residents right
 
02:13:45.470 --> 02:13:45.480 align:start position:0%
so when we're talking about votes
 
02:13:47.790 --> 02:13:47.800 align:start position:0%
happening and having warrant articles be
 
02:13:50.470 --> 02:13:50.480 align:start position:0%
voted on that's everyone in hail who's
 
02:13:51.669 --> 02:13:51.679 align:start position:0%
who's voting
 
02:13:54.629 --> 02:13:54.639 align:start position:0%
on those issues when they come up um so
 
02:13:56.030 --> 02:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to touch on just a few
 
02:13:58.030 --> 02:13:58.040 align:start position:0%
brief points I had a lot more to say but
 
02:13:59.830 --> 02:13:59.840 align:start position:0%
I think most of it has already been
 
02:14:03.390 --> 02:14:03.400 align:start position:0%
covered so since Inception in 1885
 
02:14:05.270 --> 02:14:05.280 align:start position:0%
Woodsville has operated its fire
 
02:14:06.790 --> 02:14:06.800 align:start position:0%
department and then since at least the
 
02:14:09.910 --> 02:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
early 1900s Woodsville has always
 
02:14:12.310 --> 02:14:12.320 align:start position:0%
received its proportionate share back of
 
02:14:14.510 --> 02:14:14.520 align:start position:0%
town tax revenues for woodville's
 
02:14:16.910 --> 02:14:16.920 align:start position:0%
Highway operations so again taxpayers
 
02:14:18.629 --> 02:14:18.639 align:start position:0%
pay in they're asking for that back so
 
02:14:21.189 --> 02:14:21.199 align:start position:0%
that they're not getting double taxed um
 
02:14:23.629 --> 02:14:23.639 align:start position:0%
um and so I think that's a key Point
 
02:14:27.270 --> 02:14:27.280 align:start position:0%
here up until 2019 the parties worked
 
02:14:28.750 --> 02:14:28.760 align:start position:0%
well together there were different
 
02:14:30.910 --> 02:14:30.920 align:start position:0%
formulas and systems in place informally
 
02:14:33.549 --> 02:14:33.559 align:start position:0%
and then formally um in law where the
 
02:14:35.109 --> 02:14:35.119 align:start position:0%
town and District were able to work out
 
02:14:37.790 --> 02:14:37.800 align:start position:0%
agreements on the funding structures in
 
02:14:40.030 --> 02:14:40.040 align:start position:0%
2019 we saw holl under some new
 
02:14:42.589 --> 02:14:42.599 align:start position:0%
management decided to reinterpret this
 
02:14:45.069 --> 02:14:45.079 align:start position:0%
historical Arrangement that was used and
 
02:14:47.950 --> 02:14:47.960 align:start position:0%
demanded back funds from the district
 
02:14:51.629 --> 02:14:51.639 align:start position:0%
this led to years of litigation um over
 
02:14:54.310 --> 02:14:54.320 align:start position:0%
basically the legislation in place in
 
02:14:56.790 --> 02:14:56.800 align:start position:0%
2009 through 2019 in which Woodsville
 
02:14:58.669 --> 02:14:58.679 align:start position:0%
ultimately prevailed and the court cited
 
02:15:00.790 --> 02:15:00.800 align:start position:0%
with Woodsville on a summary judgment
 
02:15:02.709 --> 02:15:02.719 align:start position:0%
motion the parties then settled the
 
02:15:04.109 --> 02:15:04.119 align:start position:0%
remainder of that
 
02:15:06.910 --> 02:15:06.920 align:start position:0%
lawsuit while the 2019 litigation was
 
02:15:08.390 --> 02:15:08.400 align:start position:0%
pending hail then petitioned the
 
02:15:10.790 --> 02:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
legislature to change the law so that it
 
02:15:12.589 --> 02:15:12.599 align:start position:0%
would be basically up to the hail voters
 
02:15:14.430 --> 02:15:14.440 align:start position:0%
to decide how much to appropriate to
 
02:15:16.189 --> 02:15:16.199 align:start position:0%
Woodsville and that's where we currently
 
02:15:18.790 --> 02:15:18.800 align:start position:0%
are um the law currently states that any
 
02:15:20.709 --> 02:15:20.719 align:start position:0%
Appropriations to the Woodsville fire
 
02:15:22.830 --> 02:15:22.840 align:start position:0%
district dist shall be as directed by
 
02:15:25.990 --> 02:15:26.000 align:start position:0%
Warren articles duy voted by the voters
 
02:15:28.030 --> 02:15:28.040 align:start position:0%
present and voting at each annual holl
 
02:15:30.870 --> 02:15:30.880 align:start position:0%
town meeting so that is what has been
 
02:15:33.790 --> 02:15:33.800 align:start position:0%
happening um for the last few years in
 
02:15:36.790 --> 02:15:36.800 align:start position:0%
2022 haal Town voters approved warrant
 
02:15:38.910 --> 02:15:38.920 align:start position:0%
articles voting to appropriate funds to
 
02:15:41.069 --> 02:15:41.079 align:start position:0%
woodville's high fire and Highway
 
02:15:43.709 --> 02:15:43.719 align:start position:0%
departments um those amounts didn't
 
02:15:45.109 --> 02:15:45.119 align:start position:0%
cover the full amount of either
 
02:15:47.430 --> 02:15:47.440 align:start position:0%
department but you know better than
 
02:15:50.069 --> 02:15:50.079 align:start position:0%
nothing uh the Dr took issue with the
 
02:15:52.109 --> 02:15:52.119 align:start position:0%
warrant articles um approved by the
 
02:15:54.270 --> 02:15:54.280 align:start position:0%
voters and so that's really the issue
 
02:15:55.709 --> 02:15:55.719 align:start position:0%
those warant articles are the issue of
 
02:15:57.430 --> 02:15:57.440 align:start position:0%
the current New Hampshire Supreme Court
 
02:16:00.069 --> 02:16:00.079 align:start position:0%
appeal um and you know I think there is
 
02:16:02.229 --> 02:16:02.239 align:start position:0%
some sense in waiting for that decision
 
02:16:05.229 --> 02:16:05.239 align:start position:0%
to come out um to see how the court
 
02:16:07.470 --> 02:16:07.480 align:start position:0%
sides and interprets current law before
 
02:16:11.189 --> 02:16:11.199 align:start position:0%
you go change existing law um now again
 
02:16:13.149 --> 02:16:13.159 align:start position:0%
we're back here again and just as the
 
02:16:14.990 --> 02:16:15.000 align:start position:0%
court was expected to settle the issues
 
02:16:17.750 --> 02:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
around that hey roll came back again and
 
02:16:19.790 --> 02:16:19.800 align:start position:0%
I was trying to you know I think in
 
02:16:22.589 --> 02:16:22.599 align:start position:0%
woodville's view s away funding from
 
02:16:25.510 --> 02:16:25.520 align:start position:0%
Woodsville um and try to gain control
 
02:16:28.109 --> 02:16:28.119 align:start position:0%
and so that's really where we're at um
 
02:16:29.750 --> 02:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
the initial version of the bill as
 
02:16:31.870 --> 02:16:31.880 align:start position:0%
introduced removed the language allowing
 
02:16:34.309 --> 02:16:34.319 align:start position:0%
the voters to appropriate funds to
 
02:16:36.669 --> 02:16:36.679 align:start position:0%
Woodsville um thankfully Senator gray
 
02:16:38.830 --> 02:16:38.840 align:start position:0%
and Perkins quoka really worked well
 
02:16:40.549 --> 02:16:40.559 align:start position:0%
together and tried to resolve the
 
02:16:43.070 --> 02:16:43.080 align:start position:0%
dispute by creating basically a default
 
02:16:45.629 --> 02:16:45.639 align:start position:0%
formula as you've heard um while we
 
02:16:47.750 --> 02:16:47.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate that sentiment um and
 
02:16:49.150 --> 02:16:49.160 align:start position:0%
hopefully the parties can come to
 
02:16:50.549 --> 02:16:50.559 align:start position:0%
agreement at some point it doesn't look
 
02:16:52.389 --> 02:16:52.399 align:start position:0%
like close to that and so we do think
 
02:16:54.070 --> 02:16:54.080 align:start position:0%
that any default formula that gets
 
02:16:56.309 --> 02:16:56.319 align:start position:0%
passed needs to be more balanced to give
 
02:16:57.870 --> 02:16:57.880 align:start position:0%
both sides incentive to come to the
 
02:16:59.870 --> 02:16:59.880 align:start position:0%
table fairly and reach um an an
 
02:17:03.750 --> 02:17:03.760 align:start position:0%
agreement in good faith so um I do have
 
02:17:05.429 --> 02:17:05.439 align:start position:0%
uh Amendment language if you're
 
02:17:08.190 --> 02:17:08.200 align:start position:0%
interested in it just adding back in the
 
02:17:10.270 --> 02:17:10.280 align:start position:0%
capital projects which is essentially
 
02:17:11.870 --> 02:17:11.880 align:start position:0%
the same formula that was used for the
 
02:17:14.990 --> 02:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
highway formula from 2009 to 2019 so
 
02:17:16.669 --> 02:17:16.679 align:start position:0%
that would revert back to that and then
 
02:17:19.270 --> 02:17:19.280 align:start position:0%
making the fire per capita um since the
 
02:17:22.070 --> 02:17:22.080 align:start position:0%
density in the district is much greater
 
02:17:23.990 --> 02:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
Woodsville population density as the
 
02:17:26.389 --> 02:17:26.399 align:start position:0%
economic Center is over 700 per square
 
02:17:28.389 --> 02:17:28.399 align:start position:0%
mile while while just ha rolls is about
 
02:17:31.110 --> 02:17:31.120 align:start position:0%
91 people per square mile so you can see
 
02:17:32.629 --> 02:17:32.639 align:start position:0%
if you're looking at fire calls who's
 
02:17:34.270 --> 02:17:34.280 align:start position:0%
going to get more calls the more densely
 
02:17:37.830 --> 02:17:37.840 align:start position:0%
populated areas um so again I just want
 
02:17:39.790 --> 02:17:39.800 align:start position:0%
to say that we appreciate all the work
 
02:17:41.709 --> 02:17:41.719 align:start position:0%
that's been done we appreciate this uh
 
02:17:42.950 --> 02:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
you taking the time this morning and I'm
 
02:17:46.589 --> 02:17:46.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:49.830 --> 02:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
questions question
 
02:17:51.750 --> 02:17:51.760 align:start position:0%
questions you're gonna let me off I
 
02:17:53.629 --> 02:17:53.639 align:start position:0%
guess you had awesome testimony you have
 
02:17:56.230 --> 02:17:56.240 align:start position:0%
no questions okay that was the last pin
 
02:18:00.230 --> 02:18:00.240 align:start position:0%
card I have on uh SB 448 was there
 
02:18:02.790 --> 02:18:02.800 align:start position:0%
anybody else looking to speak seeing
 
02:18:06.110 --> 02:18:06.120 align:start position:0%
none we will close the hearing on S SP
 
02:18:08.990 --> 02:18:09.000 align:start position:0%
448 okay we are only about 50 minutes
 
02:18:11.230 --> 02:18:11.240 align:start position:0%
behind so what we will do is take our
 
02:18:13.750 --> 02:18:13.760 align:start position:0%

municipalities and with that I
 
03:36:02.550 --> 03:36:02.560 align:start position:0%

03:36:15.670 --> 03:36:15.680 align:start position:0%
15518 on thank you and do we have a
 
03:36:18.910 --> 03:36:18.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:23.229 --> 03:36:23.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:25.150 --> 03:36:25.160 align:start position:0%
seconds and would you like to speak to
 
03:36:27.030 --> 03:36:27.040 align:start position:0%
your Amendment yeah I'll speak briefly
 
03:36:30.309 --> 03:36:30.319 align:start position:0%
to my Amendment you know um I I I see
 
03:36:32.630 --> 03:36:32.640 align:start position:0%
this amendment as a simple simplifying
 
03:36:34.950 --> 03:36:34.960 align:start position:0%
things and taking out some language and
 
03:36:42.150 --> 03:36:42.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:44.590 --> 03:36:44.600 align:start position:0%
nuisances okay thank you does anybody
 
03:36:47.070 --> 03:36:47.080 align:start position:0%
want to
 
03:36:48.870 --> 03:36:48.880 align:start position:0%
speak to the
 
03:36:51.750 --> 03:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
amendment representative priest thank
 
03:36:54.710 --> 03:36:54.720 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman I think this is very
 
03:36:57.630 --> 03:36:57.640 align:start position:0%
shortsighted um because I think Health
 
03:37:02.349 --> 03:37:02.359 align:start position:0%
Care officers do much more than just be
 
03:37:06.469 --> 03:37:06.479 align:start position:0%
proa Ian not proactive but reactive to
 
03:37:09.830 --> 03:37:09.840 align:start position:0%
anything that comes up they need to be
 
03:37:12.830 --> 03:37:12.840 align:start position:0%
proactive and they are proactive if you
 
03:37:14.910 --> 03:37:14.920 align:start position:0%
step out and let them do what they're
 
03:37:18.910 --> 03:37:18.920 align:start position:0%
supposed to be doing and I think this
 
03:37:22.150 --> 03:37:22.160 align:start position:0%
bill and this amendment does not do that
 
03:37:24.950 --> 03:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
and so therefore I will be opposing this
 
03:37:28.630 --> 03:37:28.640 align:start position:0%
amendment and the Bill thank you thank
 
03:37:31.670 --> 03:37:31.680 align:start position:0%

comments

03:40:21.990 --> 03:40:22.000 align:start position:0%
comments
 
03:40:25.229 --> 03:40:25.239 align:start position:0%
on 1550 representative
 
03:40:29.790 --> 03:40:29.800 align:start position:0%
Holland um so when we heard uh in the at
 
03:40:31.630 --> 03:40:31.640 align:start position:0%
the public hearing when we heard
 
03:40:34.590 --> 03:40:34.600 align:start position:0%
testimony uh the thing that really came
 
03:40:36.990 --> 03:40:37.000 align:start position:0%
up there was masking came up and
 
03:40:40.990 --> 03:40:41.000 align:start position:0%
immunization came up uh were were how
 
03:40:43.550 --> 03:40:43.560 align:start position:0%
municipalities had enacted it and and it
 
03:40:46.469 --> 03:40:46.479 align:start position:0%
seems to be the the uh impetus for this
 
03:40:49.269 --> 03:40:49.279 align:start position:0%
legislation that we don't allow uh
 
03:40:52.870 --> 03:40:52.880 align:start position:0%
municipalities to to regulate that and
 
03:40:55.469 --> 03:40:55.479 align:start position:0%
and so of course we're looking at now
 
03:40:58.269 --> 03:40:58.279 align:start position:0%
nuisances the thing is is that and
 
03:40:59.830 --> 03:40:59.840 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I served on both the
 
03:41:02.229 --> 03:41:02.239 align:start position:0%
school board and the Town Council during
 
03:41:06.590 --> 03:41:06.600 align:start position:0%
covid uh covid a a highly infectious
 
03:41:08.630 --> 03:41:08.640 align:start position:0%
airborne disease that kills a million
 
03:41:11.110 --> 03:41:11.120 align:start position:0%
people really wasn't in our Playbook and
 
03:41:11.910 --> 03:41:11.920 align:start position:0%
as a
 
03:41:14.349 --> 03:41:14.359 align:start position:0%
municipality it really overwhelmed our
 
03:41:16.510 --> 03:41:16.520 align:start position:0%
ability to regulate we didn't know
 
03:41:18.189 --> 03:41:18.199 align:start position:0%
anything about it and so it really was
 
03:41:20.790 --> 03:41:20.800 align:start position:0%
the duty of the state to regulate the
 
03:41:22.670 --> 03:41:22.680 align:start position:0%
public health element of it and
 
03:41:25.309 --> 03:41:25.319 align:start position:0%
initially they they did do that they
 
03:41:27.830 --> 03:41:27.840 align:start position:0%
closed the schools down and we tried to
 
03:41:29.590 --> 03:41:29.600 align:start position:0%
figure out how to actually make it work
 
03:41:32.229 --> 03:41:32.239 align:start position:0%
but as we moved in the summer and then
 
03:41:35.510 --> 03:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
to the fall and we're being asked to to
 
03:41:38.510 --> 03:41:38.520 align:start position:0%
reopen the schools the state failed us
 
03:41:40.830 --> 03:41:40.840 align:start position:0%
they did not provide us with clear uh
 
03:41:43.349 --> 03:41:43.359 align:start position:0%
regulation they they said well these are
 
03:41:45.510 --> 03:41:45.520 align:start position:0%
some ideas we have but we'll leave it up
 
03:41:47.950 --> 03:41:47.960 align:start position:0%
to the local municipality to figure out
 
03:41:50.870 --> 03:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
how to make it work and so they punted
 
03:41:53.830 --> 03:41:53.840 align:start position:0%
their responsibility to us and the state
 
03:41:57.870 --> 03:41:57.880 align:start position:0%
at any time can override any local uh
 
03:41:59.550 --> 03:41:59.560 align:start position:0%
regulation particularly when it deals
 
03:42:01.950 --> 03:42:01.960 align:start position:0%
with an emergency but they chose not to
 
03:42:04.309 --> 03:42:04.319 align:start position:0%
and it was excruciating as we made our
 
03:42:06.710 --> 03:42:06.720 align:start position:0%
way through the school year the state
 
03:42:09.189 --> 03:42:09.199 align:start position:0%
finally after we had come up with
 
03:42:11.910 --> 03:42:11.920 align:start position:0%
matrixes to like when it was actually
 
03:42:14.229 --> 03:42:14.239 align:start position:0%
safe to open and when we could have
 
03:42:17.229 --> 03:42:17.239 align:start position:0%
Staffing the state overruled all of that
 
03:42:19.630 --> 03:42:19.640 align:start position:0%
and uh said we could not mask and that
 
03:42:21.830 --> 03:42:21.840 align:start position:0%
we had to go back in person they could
 
03:42:24.229 --> 03:42:24.239 align:start position:0%
have done that at any time initially and
 
03:42:26.469 --> 03:42:26.479 align:start position:0%
helped us work through the prop work
 
03:42:28.990 --> 03:42:29.000 align:start position:0%
through the uh the pandemic but they
 
03:42:32.229 --> 03:42:32.239 align:start position:0%
chose not to and so now when I look at
 
03:42:35.590 --> 03:42:35.600 align:start position:0%
this as we've moved away from covid uh
 
03:42:37.469 --> 03:42:37.479 align:start position:0%
rather than saying we want the state to
 
03:42:40.469 --> 03:42:40.479 align:start position:0%
take responsibility for uh for uh
 
03:42:42.950 --> 03:42:42.960 align:start position:0%
medical emergencies were saying what the
 
03:42:45.149 --> 03:42:45.159 align:start position:0%
local mun penalizing local mun
 
03:42:47.149 --> 03:42:47.159 align:start position:0%
municipality who had to deal with the
 
03:42:48.830 --> 03:42:48.840 align:start position:0%
failure of the state by saying that we
 
03:42:51.070 --> 03:42:51.080 align:start position:0%
can't regulate it and so to say that I
 
03:42:53.269 --> 03:42:53.279 align:start position:0%
have trust issues about the state is an
 
03:42:55.389 --> 03:42:55.399 align:start position:0%
understatement I think this legislation
 
03:42:58.950 --> 03:42:58.960 align:start position:0%
is not necessary uh solving health
 
03:43:01.389 --> 03:43:01.399 align:start position:0%
crisises is a partnership between the
 
03:43:05.110 --> 03:43:05.120 align:start position:0%
municipality and the state this does not
 
03:43:05.120 --> 03:43:08.710 align:start position:0%
municipality and the state this does not
help

03:43:08.710 --> 03:43:08.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:12.950 --> 03:43:12.960 align:start position:0%
that other comments representative yella
 
03:43:15.870 --> 03:43:15.880 align:start position:0%
thank you um I actually
 
03:43:17.670 --> 03:43:17.680 align:start position:0%
with all due respect I completely
 
03:43:20.710 --> 03:43:20.720 align:start position:0%
disagree with representative Howen that
 
03:43:24.750 --> 03:43:24.760 align:start position:0%
this bill has anything to do with Co um
 
03:43:27.510 --> 03:43:27.520 align:start position:0%
and there's an entire
 
03:43:30.309 --> 03:43:30.319 align:start position:0%
investigation um done by the house right
 
03:43:32.790 --> 03:43:32.800 align:start position:0%
now investigating the covid response and
 
03:43:35.070 --> 03:43:35.080 align:start position:0%
this is not a byproduct of that
 
03:43:40.790 --> 03:43:40.800 align:start position:0%
investigation um in fact um I am aware
 
03:43:41.870 --> 03:43:41.880 align:start position:0%
of the
 
03:43:45.349 --> 03:43:45.359 align:start position:0%
testimony of that was brought forward
 
03:43:50.149 --> 03:43:50.159 align:start position:0%
and um the prime sponsor said that their
 
03:43:54.670 --> 03:43:54.680 align:start position:0%
main um kind of impetus and thing that
 
03:43:58.269 --> 03:43:58.279 align:start position:0%
got them enthusiastic about this was the
 
03:44:02.790 --> 03:44:02.800 align:start position:0%
blatant overreach by some municipalities
 
03:44:06.429 --> 03:44:06.439 align:start position:0%
by regulating tattooed parlors and
 
03:44:08.429 --> 03:44:08.439 align:start position:0%
saying that they needed to have medical
 
03:44:13.349 --> 03:44:13.359 align:start position:0%
doctors as tattoo artists and that um
 
03:44:16.910 --> 03:44:16.920 align:start position:0%
and there are other examples like um
 
03:44:21.269 --> 03:44:21.279 align:start position:0%
municipality in in uh Kingston puts has
 
03:44:24.990 --> 03:44:25.000 align:start position:0%
a uh has a ordinance done by their
 
03:44:28.750 --> 03:44:28.760 align:start position:0%
health officers regulating the uh
 
03:44:31.269 --> 03:44:31.279 align:start position:0%
migration of birds and what you can't if
 
03:44:33.830 --> 03:44:33.840 align:start position:0%
you can feed them or not those are
 
03:44:37.070 --> 03:44:37.080 align:start position:0%
absolute examples that that of of
 
03:44:40.469 --> 03:44:40.479 align:start position:0%
overreach that this bill is specifically
 
03:44:42.790 --> 03:44:42.800 align:start position:0%
trying to address things that the that
 
03:44:45.070 --> 03:44:45.080 align:start position:0%
the state the state regulates tattoo
 
03:44:48.229 --> 03:44:48.239 align:start position:0%
artists not the municipality they are
 
03:44:51.110 --> 03:44:51.120 align:start position:0%
blatantly overreach and so I think that
 
03:44:54.950 --> 03:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
this addresses that most of all
 
03:44:59.229 --> 03:44:59.239 align:start position:0%
it uh it would kept on being asked if if
 
03:45:02.389 --> 03:45:02.399 align:start position:0%
uh the covid was a nuisance no it's a
 
03:45:04.110 --> 03:45:04.120 align:start position:0%
public health emergency a nuisance is
 
03:45:06.149 --> 03:45:06.159 align:start position:0%
not a public health emergency Public
 
03:45:08.790 --> 03:45:08.800 align:start position:0%
Health Emergency does let let raise to
 
03:45:12.510 --> 03:45:12.520 align:start position:0%
the level of a state level thing that
 
03:45:14.269 --> 03:45:14.279 align:start position:0%
needed to be addressed and all of that
 
03:45:18.510 --> 03:45:18.520 align:start position:0%
stuff but but this is far more reaching
 
03:45:22.710 --> 03:45:22.720 align:start position:0%
um than just that topic and so that is I
 
03:45:25.389 --> 03:45:25.399 align:start position:0%
think that what we should be you know
 
03:45:28.309 --> 03:45:28.319 align:start position:0%
when you're thinking of a of a
 
03:45:35.510 --> 03:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
bad policy put forward by um the the
 
03:45:40.070 --> 03:45:40.080 align:start position:0%
uh Public Health officers think of the
 
03:45:42.110 --> 03:45:42.120 align:start position:0%
regulation of tattoo artists and the
 
03:45:44.429 --> 03:45:44.439 align:start position:0%
regulation of what you can and cannot do
 
03:45:48.189 --> 03:45:48.199 align:start position:0%
to to um you know wild geese that are in
 
03:45:50.389 --> 03:45:50.399 align:start position:0%
flying around and Landing next to your
 
03:45:56.229 --> 03:45:56.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:58.950 --> 03:45:58.960 align:start position:0%
child uh representative
 
03:46:01.229 --> 03:46:01.239 align:start position:0%
stavis thank you Mr
 
03:46:03.910 --> 03:46:03.920 align:start position:0%
chair um with all due respect to tattoo
 
03:46:06.269 --> 03:46:06.279 align:start position:0%
poers and migrating
 
03:46:09.149 --> 03:46:09.159 align:start position:0%
geese um I have been on the municip and
 
03:46:11.469 --> 03:46:11.479 align:start position:0%
County government committee for going on
 
03:46:15.510 --> 03:46:15.520 align:start position:0%
six years now and ever since Co
 
03:46:18.790 --> 03:46:18.800 align:start position:0%
we have had this bill come before us
 
03:46:23.189 --> 03:46:23.199 align:start position:0%
every single time um believe once it
 
03:46:25.229 --> 03:46:25.239 align:start position:0%
passed a few times it didn't pass but
 
03:46:27.590 --> 03:46:27.600 align:start position:0%
it's kind of like the undead it keeps
 
03:46:27.600 --> 03:46:28.550 align:start position:0%
it's kind of like the undead it keeps
coming

03:46:28.550 --> 03:46:28.560 align:start position:0%
coming
 
03:46:33.389 --> 03:46:33.399 align:start position:0%
back I um believe that Statewide Health
 
03:46:36.110 --> 03:46:36.120 align:start position:0%
emergencies frequently emerge at the
 
03:46:39.510 --> 03:46:39.520 align:start position:0%
local level first and I don't just
 
03:46:41.670 --> 03:46:41.680 align:start position:0%
believe this I know this from experience
 
03:46:43.389 --> 03:46:43.399 align:start position:0%
because when I was at Dartmouth I was
 
03:46:45.910 --> 03:46:45.920 align:start position:0%
co-chair of the uh Emergency Management
 
03:46:49.389 --> 03:46:49.399 align:start position:0%
committee there uh we had an outbreak of
 
03:46:51.910 --> 03:46:51.920 align:start position:0%
hemorrhagic influenza in the
 
03:46:53.830 --> 03:46:53.840 align:start position:0%
undergraduate student population that
 
03:46:56.830 --> 03:46:56.840 align:start position:0%
was identified by our town Public Health
 
03:47:00.189 --> 03:47:00.199 align:start position:0%
officer at the time and because that
 
03:47:02.469 --> 03:47:02.479 align:start position:0%
public health officer was able to do his
 
03:47:05.429 --> 03:47:05.439 align:start position:0%
job and inform the community and inform
 
03:47:08.429 --> 03:47:08.439 align:start position:0%
the administration of Dartmouth only one
 
03:47:11.469 --> 03:47:11.479 align:start position:0%
student died what we had a situation
 
03:47:13.670 --> 03:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
where dozens and dozens of students
 
03:47:16.229 --> 03:47:16.239 align:start position:0%
could have died and could have spread to
 
03:47:19.429 --> 03:47:19.439 align:start position:0%
other towns and Statewide so I will not
 
03:47:20.990 --> 03:47:21.000 align:start position:0%
be supporting this amendment and I will
 
03:47:24.389 --> 03:47:24.399 align:start position:0%
not be supporting this Bill thank
 
03:47:26.790 --> 03:47:26.800 align:start position:0%
you uh representative
 
03:47:30.429 --> 03:47:30.439 align:start position:0%
Brown thank you Mr chairman
 
03:47:33.630 --> 03:47:33.640 align:start position:0%
um I guess my whole issue during the
 
03:47:36.149 --> 03:47:36.159 align:start position:0%
testimony was a simple statement that
 
03:47:38.910 --> 03:47:38.920 align:start position:0%
they made U the state people regarding
 
03:47:41.469 --> 03:47:41.479 align:start position:0%
that the fact that uh Public Health
 
03:47:43.630 --> 03:47:43.640 align:start position:0%
officers only have to have 3 hours of
 
03:47:47.469 --> 03:47:47.479 align:start position:0%
training to be able to hold that job in
 
03:47:49.710 --> 03:47:49.720 align:start position:0%
a municipality and I don't think that's
 
03:47:51.910 --> 03:47:51.920 align:start position:0%
adequate for them to be able to handle
 
03:47:53.830 --> 03:47:53.840 align:start position:0%
some of the things that that come up in
 
03:47:56.950 --> 03:47:56.960 align:start position:0%
in in the townships right now so I I
 
03:47:58.910 --> 03:47:58.920 align:start position:0%
think that uh something that limits
 
03:48:02.469 --> 03:48:02.479 align:start position:0%
their Authority uh is appropriate and i
 
03:48:03.910 --> 03:48:03.920 align:start position:0%
would support this amendment I'm not
 
03:48:05.990 --> 03:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
saying that it's perfect but I think we
 
03:48:07.670 --> 03:48:07.680 align:start position:0%
need to do something different to get
 
03:48:09.630 --> 03:48:09.640 align:start position:0%
this under control a little bit thank
 
03:48:13.510 --> 03:48:13.520 align:start position:0%
you represent PRI thank you Mr chairman
 
03:48:15.349 --> 03:48:15.359 align:start position:0%
I will not be supporting
 
03:48:17.349 --> 03:48:17.359 align:start position:0%
Amendment 1
 
03:48:21.030 --> 03:48:21.040 align:start position:0%
155h for the same purposes that I have
 
03:48:24.110 --> 03:48:24.120 align:start position:0%
stated previously I think it's way too
 
03:48:26.550 --> 03:48:26.560 align:start position:0%
restrictive it does not include
 
03:48:29.229 --> 03:48:29.239 align:start position:0%
emergency preparedness or infectious
 
03:48:32.469 --> 03:48:32.479 align:start position:0%
disease prevention or chronic disease
 
03:48:33.990 --> 03:48:34.000 align:start position:0%
prevention or
 
03:48:36.670 --> 03:48:36.680 align:start position:0%
immunization we right now we have
 
03:48:39.510 --> 03:48:39.520 align:start position:0%
outbreaks of polio happening in our
 
03:48:42.349 --> 03:48:42.359 align:start position:0%
communities in which the health officers
 
03:48:45.670 --> 03:48:45.680 align:start position:0%
are the first ones to look at this and
 
03:48:48.469 --> 03:48:48.479 align:start position:0%
to get help for their communities
 
03:48:50.990 --> 03:48:51.000 align:start position:0%
they're there to look for the Health and
 
03:48:54.429 --> 03:48:54.439 align:start position:0%
Welfare and safety of their people and
 
03:48:58.189 --> 03:48:58.199 align:start position:0%
this amendment restricts them to a very
 
03:49:01.870 --> 03:49:01.880 align:start position:0%
minimal task and does not address this
 
03:49:04.149 --> 03:49:04.159 align:start position:0%
issue thank
 
03:49:07.070 --> 03:49:07.080 align:start position:0%
you further comments representative
 
03:49:10.189 --> 03:49:10.199 align:start position:0%
kahill thank you Mr chair you
 
03:49:13.790 --> 03:49:13.800 align:start position:0%
know prior to being on this committee I
 
03:49:15.910 --> 03:49:15.920 align:start position:0%
worked in a human research lab for the
 
03:49:19.750 --> 03:49:19.760 align:start position:0%
US Army um and we did human research
 
03:49:23.229 --> 03:49:23.239 align:start position:0%
humans so I probably forgot a little a
 
03:49:25.429 --> 03:49:25.439 align:start position:0%
lot more than um most of you guys are
 
03:49:26.670 --> 03:49:26.680 align:start position:0%
ever going to know about this sort of
 
03:49:28.349 --> 03:49:28.359 align:start position:0%
thing and I do have a question from my
 
03:49:32.550 --> 03:49:32.560 align:start position:0%
colleague over there um how many actual
 
03:49:33.950 --> 03:49:33.960 align:start position:0%
times have you called your health
 
03:49:36.149 --> 03:49:36.159 align:start position:0%
officer and asked him to do something
 
03:49:38.550 --> 03:49:38.560 align:start position:0%
like that like several times because
 
03:49:41.309 --> 03:49:41.319 align:start position:0%
they're responsible for making sure that
 
03:49:45.429 --> 03:49:45.439 align:start position:0%
the restaurants don't pass out cont
 
03:49:48.790 --> 03:49:48.800 align:start position:0%
food that's how many times I mean how
 
03:49:48.800 --> 03:49:51.429 align:start position:0%
food that's how many times I mean how
many

03:49:51.429 --> 03:49:51.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:54.910 --> 03:49:54.920 align:start position:0%
times when a question is asked the uh
 
03:49:56.870 --> 03:49:56.880 align:start position:0%
recipient first has
 
03:50:00.189 --> 03:50:00.199 align:start position:0%
to make sure everything goes through the
 
03:50:03.910 --> 03:50:03.920 align:start position:0%
chair and if the individual wishes to
 
03:50:05.630 --> 03:50:05.640 align:start position:0%
answer then he can answer and if you
 
03:50:07.510 --> 03:50:07.520 align:start position:0%
have another question you may ask the
 
03:50:10.070 --> 03:50:10.080 align:start position:0%
question through the
 
03:50:12.469 --> 03:50:12.479 align:start position:0%
chair uh I don't need any more
 
03:50:23.750 --> 03:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:28.830 --> 03:50:28.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:28.840 --> 03:50:31.670 align:start position:0%
 
lales

03:50:31.670 --> 03:50:31.680 align:start position:0%
lales
 
03:50:31.680 --> 03:50:34.670 align:start position:0%
lales
no

03:50:34.670 --> 03:50:34.680 align:start position:0%
no
 
03:50:37.149 --> 03:50:37.159 align:start position:0%
representative maor go ahead thank you
 
03:50:40.469 --> 03:50:40.479 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I I I wanted to uh I wanted
 
03:50:42.429 --> 03:50:42.439 align:start position:0%
to uh to pick up on something that I've
 
03:50:44.710 --> 03:50:44.720 align:start position:0%
heard here and reflect back on something
 
03:50:46.030 --> 03:50:46.040 align:start position:0%
that I've heard in my own Community the
 
03:50:47.670 --> 03:50:47.680 align:start position:0%
minute we have to start writing things
 
03:50:50.149 --> 03:50:50.159 align:start position:0%
down as far as the limits to what we can
 
03:50:51.950 --> 03:50:51.960 align:start position:0%
and cannot do we've lost the battle
 
03:50:53.550 --> 03:50:53.560 align:start position:0%
because we cannot include everything
 
03:50:56.429 --> 03:50:56.439 align:start position:0%
that we can and cannot do um and so I
 
03:50:58.510 --> 03:50:58.520 align:start position:0%
cannot support the amendment because as
 
03:51:01.510 --> 03:51:01.520 align:start position:0%
we have heard and and I believe although
 
03:51:03.670 --> 03:51:03.680 align:start position:0%
I do respect that a public health
 
03:51:05.910 --> 03:51:05.920 align:start position:0%
officer needs more
 
03:51:08.590 --> 03:51:08.600 align:start position:0%
training if we start listing what they
 
03:51:10.990 --> 03:51:11.000 align:start position:0%
can and cannot do and put them into a
 
03:51:13.510 --> 03:51:13.520 align:start position:0%
box I think we have put our own health
 
03:51:16.389 --> 03:51:16.399 align:start position:0%
at risk I think we put ourselves at risk
 
03:51:18.910 --> 03:51:18.920 align:start position:0%
so um I I think we should be looking at
 
03:51:20.550 --> 03:51:20.560 align:start position:0%
this in a different way but I don't
 
03:51:25.590 --> 03:51:25.600 align:start position:0%

representative lales seconds uh the
 
03:56:24.030 --> 03:56:24.040 align:start position:0%
motion would you like to speak to your
 
03:56:25.990 --> 03:56:26.000 align:start position:0%
motion representative power thank you Mr
 
03:56:28.389 --> 03:56:28.399 align:start position:0%
chairman this bill um comes to us from
 
03:56:30.590 --> 03:56:30.600 align:start position:0%
the Senate it was at the request of the
 
03:56:33.189 --> 03:56:33.199 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
03:56:36.070 --> 03:56:36.080 align:start position:0%
and what it does is it um eliminates the
 
03:56:40.590 --> 03:56:40.600 align:start position:0%
requirement for a background check on
 
03:56:43.030 --> 03:56:43.040 align:start position:0%
nominees for the position of Health
 
03:56:46.389 --> 03:56:46.399 align:start position:0%
officer to be sent to the commissioner
 
03:56:49.550 --> 03:56:49.560 align:start position:0%
or his or her design at the Department
 
03:56:51.750 --> 03:56:51.760 align:start position:0%
of Health and her Human
 
03:56:55.550 --> 03:56:55.560 align:start position:0%
Services and the based on the the
 
03:56:57.149 --> 03:56:57.159 align:start position:0%
hearing and testimony there were a
 
03:56:59.870 --> 03:56:59.880 align:start position:0%
couple reasons why this was requested
 
03:57:03.550 --> 03:57:03.560 align:start position:0%
one is that is that the health officer
 
03:57:08.309 --> 03:57:08.319 align:start position:0%
is an employee of the town in which they
 
03:57:13.149 --> 03:57:13.159 align:start position:0%
um serve therefore the it was the I
 
03:57:16.149 --> 03:57:16.159 align:start position:0%
guess best practice is that the hiring
 
03:57:19.269 --> 03:57:19.279 align:start position:0%
process including the obtaining of the
 
03:57:21.590 --> 03:57:21.600 align:start position:0%
background check is in in addition to
 
03:57:23.830 --> 03:57:23.840 align:start position:0%
the reviewing of that and that whole
 
03:57:27.070 --> 03:57:27.080 align:start position:0%
hiring um process and procedure remain
 
03:57:30.750 --> 03:57:30.760 align:start position:0%
at the local level and that uh
 
03:57:34.870 --> 03:57:34.880 align:start position:0%
the that background check um did not
 
03:57:37.990 --> 03:57:38.000 align:start position:0%
need to be submitted to
 
03:57:40.750 --> 03:57:40.760 align:start position:0%
DHHS because once that whole hiring
 
03:57:45.149 --> 03:57:45.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:48.590 --> 03:57:48.600 align:start position:0%
was finalized that the nominee would be
 
03:57:51.149 --> 03:57:51.159 align:start position:0%
the the name of the candidate would be
 
03:57:52.630 --> 03:57:52.640 align:start position:0%
um submitted to
 
03:57:57.630 --> 03:57:57.640 align:start position:0%
DHHS and they would appoint that
 
03:58:01.229 --> 03:58:01.239 align:start position:0%
person and furthermore by keeping the
 
03:58:04.070 --> 03:58:04.080 align:start position:0%
background check local it also addressed
 
03:58:06.510 --> 03:58:06.520 align:start position:0%
any privacy concerns with the submission
 
03:58:10.910 --> 03:58:10.920 align:start position:0%
and archival of of that um sensitive
 
03:58:14.750 --> 03:58:14.760 align:start position:0%
information by DHHS so this this bill
 
03:58:17.389 --> 03:58:17.399 align:start position:0%
makes sense and it streamlines things
 
03:58:17.399 --> 03:58:18.910 align:start position:0%
makes sense and it streamlines things
thank

03:58:18.910 --> 03:58:18.920 align:start position:0%

03:58:23.030 --> 03:58:23.040 align:start position:0%

03:58:29.590 --> 03:58:29.600 align:start position:0%
Gallagher um so I initially was a bit
 
03:58:35.189 --> 03:58:35.199 align:start position:0%
suspicious of this bill um just um based
 
03:58:38.389 --> 03:58:38.399 align:start position:0%
on the idea of it but having found out
 
03:58:42.469 --> 03:58:42.479 align:start position:0%
or um that uh DHHS is on board with it
 
03:58:45.110 --> 03:58:45.120 align:start position:0%
that um
 
03:58:48.950 --> 03:58:48.960 align:start position:0%
that uh mitigated my concerns so I'll be
 
03:58:52.550 --> 03:58:52.560 align:start position:0%
supporting it too further
 
03:58:54.990 --> 03:58:55.000 align:start position:0%

um Senate Bill
 
04:06:04.550 --> 04:06:04.560 align:start position:0%
532 representative Cahill I believe you
 
04:06:06.870 --> 04:06:06.880 align:start position:0%
have an amendment to
 
04:06:10.110 --> 04:06:10.120 align:start position:0%
introduce yes I move Amendment
 
04:06:14.870 --> 04:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
20241 15698 on Senate Bill 5 32 thank
 
04:06:17.389 --> 04:06:17.399 align:start position:0%
you do we have a second on that
 
04:06:19.990 --> 04:06:20.000 align:start position:0%
representative Elward seconds that and
 
04:06:22.030 --> 04:06:22.040 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak to it sir thank
 
04:06:23.070 --> 04:06:23.080 align:start position:0%
you Mr
 
04:06:25.830 --> 04:06:25.840 align:start position:0%
chair um this is a simple Amendment
 
04:06:28.269 --> 04:06:28.279 align:start position:0%
that's adding a new section and in the
 
04:06:30.030 --> 04:06:30.040 align:start position:0%
gist of the amendment is that it's
 
04:06:33.149 --> 04:06:33.159 align:start position:0%
requiring the data to be on the website
 
04:06:34.950 --> 04:06:34.960 align:start position:0%
for at least 90
 
04:06:40.030 --> 04:06:40.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:43.670 --> 04:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
comments represent stavis
 
04:06:46.590 --> 04:06:46.600 align:start position:0%
question a technical requirement that
 
04:06:49.110 --> 04:06:49.120 align:start position:0%
the amendment I believe
 
04:06:52.670 --> 04:06:52.680 align:start position:0%
imposes um in the absence of a website a
 
04:06:54.469 --> 04:06:54.479 align:start position:0%
political subdivision shall post the
 
04:06:57.110 --> 04:06:57.120 align:start position:0%
information in two appropriate places do
 
04:06:59.429 --> 04:06:59.439 align:start position:0%
those postings H have to remain in place
 
04:07:02.389 --> 04:07:02.399 align:start position:0%
for 90 days and if those public places
 
04:07:04.950 --> 04:07:04.960 align:start position:0%
are newspapers of General circulation
 
04:07:05.990 --> 04:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
that's going to cost those
 
04:07:09.110 --> 04:07:09.120 align:start position:0%
municipalities a ton of
 
04:07:13.830 --> 04:07:13.840 align:start position:0%
money that is a valid point um I is a
 
04:07:16.590 --> 04:07:16.600 align:start position:0%
valid point I I'll speak to that the
 
04:07:18.469 --> 04:07:18.479 align:start position:0%
amendment as you aware representative
 
04:07:21.870 --> 04:07:21.880 align:start position:0%
stavis was mine um I really didn't look
 
04:07:24.550 --> 04:07:24.560 align:start position:0%
at the
 
04:07:27.309 --> 04:07:27.319 align:start position:0%
posting in the two appropriate places
 
04:07:29.990 --> 04:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
probably should have had it also um I
 
04:07:33.630 --> 04:07:33.640 align:start position:0%
think they we were told there are only
 
04:07:36.550 --> 04:07:36.560 align:start position:0%
five cities or whatever in the state
 
04:07:38.590 --> 04:07:38.600 align:start position:0%
that does not have
 
04:07:42.109 --> 04:07:42.119 align:start position:0%
websites or what's that more than that
 
04:07:46.269 --> 04:07:46.279 align:start position:0%
five oh okay five um so actually you're
 
04:07:48.429 --> 04:07:48.439 align:start position:0%
right oversight on my part
 
04:07:51.109 --> 04:07:51.119 align:start position:0%
I that could be taken care of in a floor
 
04:07:54.309 --> 04:07:54.319 align:start position:0%
Amendment if it's that uh important I
 
04:07:56.710 --> 04:07:56.720 align:start position:0%
think representative
 
04:08:00.830 --> 04:08:00.840 align:start position:0%
Elward um just just to respond to this I
 
04:08:03.830 --> 04:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
I've always understood the word posting
 
04:08:06.349 --> 04:08:06.359 align:start position:0%
to mean either to a website or to a
 
04:08:11.590 --> 04:08:11.600 align:start position:0%
bulletin board and that publishing in a
 
04:08:17.469 --> 04:08:17.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:20.830 --> 04:08:20.840 align:start position:0%
publishing further comments represent
 
04:08:23.189 --> 04:08:23.199 align:start position:0%
power thank you Mr CH thank you Mr
 
04:08:25.630 --> 04:08:25.640 align:start position:0%
chairman with regards to this amendment
 
04:08:28.910 --> 04:08:28.920 align:start position:0%
the last sentence it says in the absence
 
04:08:31.349 --> 04:08:31.359 align:start position:0%
of a website a political subdivision
 
04:08:33.870 --> 04:08:33.880 align:start position:0%
shall post the information in two
 
04:08:37.550 --> 04:08:37.560 align:start position:0%
appropriate places seeing that um the 90
 
04:08:41.550 --> 04:08:41.560 align:start position:0%
days is very specific to the posting on
 
04:08:43.950 --> 04:08:43.960 align:start position:0%
a website I would say that
 
04:08:46.510 --> 04:08:46.520 align:start position:0%
with regards to posting in two
 
04:08:49.910 --> 04:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
appropriate places the the bill would be
 
04:08:53.309 --> 04:08:53.319 align:start position:0%
silent so it it would be open-ended and
 
04:08:55.630 --> 04:08:55.640 align:start position:0%
as you had suggested a floor Amendment
 
04:08:57.590 --> 04:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
if this one somebody wanted to address
 
04:09:01.630 --> 04:09:01.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:04.870 --> 04:09:04.880 align:start position:0%
appropriate representative
 
04:09:07.670 --> 04:09:07.680 align:start position:0%
Ella I'm going to be opposing this
 
04:09:12.189 --> 04:09:12.199 align:start position:0%
amendment and the bill um which I will
 
04:09:14.950 --> 04:09:14.960 align:start position:0%
will talk to more about when the bill
 
04:09:19.670 --> 04:09:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:22.429 --> 04:09:22.439 align:start position:0%
um in in
 
04:09:26.670 --> 04:09:26.680 align:start position:0%
the in my vision which I'll expand upon
 
04:09:30.710 --> 04:09:30.720 align:start position:0%
later that the uh posting would be
 
04:09:34.950 --> 04:09:34.960 align:start position:0%
perpetual and um on the on the website
 
04:09:36.830 --> 04:09:36.840 align:start position:0%
and so for that reason I'm going to
 
04:09:40.070 --> 04:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
oppose this um and I will discuss
 
04:09:42.790 --> 04:09:42.800 align:start position:0%
further about when the when we talk
 
04:09:43.870 --> 04:09:43.880 align:start position:0%
about the bill

04:11:53.229 --> 04:11:53.239 align:start position:0%
PRI I believe in transparency you turned
 
04:11:57.149 --> 04:11:57.159 align:start position:0%
your mic off I believe in transparency
 
04:11:59.229 --> 04:11:59.239 align:start position:0%
and I believe that this
 
04:12:03.030 --> 04:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
bill uh provides the the residents of of
 
04:12:05.990 --> 04:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
all of our communities what we are doing
 
04:12:08.229 --> 04:12:08.239 align:start position:0%
to them and by bringing back grants and
 
04:12:11.189 --> 04:12:11.199 align:start position:0%
funding to to assist them and I think
 
04:12:13.750 --> 04:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
this is very important to let them know
 
04:12:16.830 --> 04:12:16.840 align:start position:0%
that government is working thank
 
04:12:19.429 --> 04:12:19.439 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
04:12:24.630 --> 04:12:24.640 align:start position:0%
yella thank you uh Mr chair and uh
 
04:12:27.269 --> 04:12:27.279 align:start position:0%
hopefully um even though I think a lot
 
04:12:30.429 --> 04:12:30.439 align:start position:0%
of people are uh right
 
04:12:33.870 --> 04:12:33.880 align:start position:0%
now um expecting to vote in favor of
 
04:12:35.149 --> 04:12:35.159 align:start position:0%
this that I will be able to convince
 
04:12:38.030 --> 04:12:38.040 align:start position:0%
them otherwise
 
04:12:42.469 --> 04:12:42.479 align:start position:0%
um I did some research on this directly
 
04:12:45.469 --> 04:12:45.479 align:start position:0%
after the committee hearing I went over
 
04:12:49.790 --> 04:12:49.800 align:start position:0%
because as I think I indicated in the
 
04:12:53.070 --> 04:12:53.080 align:start position:0%
hearing that um there might that the
 
04:12:55.109 --> 04:12:55.119 align:start position:0%
state might already know about all of
 
04:12:59.670 --> 04:12:59.680 align:start position:0%
this information and um in fact of
 
04:13:03.189 --> 04:13:03.199 align:start position:0%
course it does um the I went over to the
 
04:13:05.149 --> 04:13:05.159 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue and tried to see
 
04:13:07.910 --> 04:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
if they might um have that information
 
04:13:09.910 --> 04:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
and may actually already be posting it
 
04:13:12.030 --> 04:13:12.040 align:start position:0%
and stuff like that and they pointed me
 
04:13:16.910 --> 04:13:16.920 align:start position:0%
to um um the the governor's office which
 
04:13:20.550 --> 04:13:20.560 align:start position:0%
has um up on its on one of its Myriad of
 
04:13:24.750 --> 04:13:24.760 align:start position:0%
websites or um transparent New
 
04:13:24.760 --> 04:13:26.389 align:start position:0%
websites or um transparent New
Hampshire

04:13:26.389 --> 04:13:26.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:13:31.910 --> 04:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
uh website which has all of the um
 
04:13:34.229 --> 04:13:34.239 align:start position:0%
vendor payments from the state already
 
04:13:34.239 --> 04:13:35.269 align:start position:0%
vendor payments from the state already
on

04:13:35.269 --> 04:13:35.279 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:13:39.510 --> 04:13:39.520 align:start position:0%
it and there is a method for you to
 
04:13:42.710 --> 04:13:42.720 align:start position:0%
search vendors and I plugged in my town
 
04:13:42.720 --> 04:13:44.109 align:start position:0%
search vendors and I plugged in my town
of

04:13:44.109 --> 04:13:44.119 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:13:47.149 --> 04:13:47.159 align:start position:0%
and I pulled up uh you know a recent
 
04:13:50.670 --> 04:13:50.680 align:start position:0%
payment for school lunches to uh from
 
04:13:55.469 --> 04:13:55.479 align:start position:0%
the state to uh to my town and so it's a
 
04:13:58.550 --> 04:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
little bit clunky as far right now
 
04:14:00.109 --> 04:14:00.119 align:start position:0%
because you're just searching by vendor
 
04:14:01.349 --> 04:14:01.359 align:start position:0%
and that's all vendors not just
 
04:14:03.229 --> 04:14:03.239 align:start position:0%
municipalities and stuff like that and
 
04:14:09.630 --> 04:14:09.640 align:start position:0%
so I reached out to the um the
 
04:14:12.710 --> 04:14:12.720 align:start position:0%
uh New Hampshire Department it
 
04:14:12.720 --> 04:14:13.550 align:start position:0%
uh New Hampshire Department it
Department

04:14:13.550 --> 04:14:13.560 align:start position:0%
Department
 
04:14:18.030 --> 04:14:18.040 align:start position:0%
that actually houses that website and I
 
04:14:21.349 --> 04:14:21.359 align:start position:0%
spoke to the director earlier today and
 
04:14:26.429 --> 04:14:26.439 align:start position:0%
they he indicated that um they obviously
 
04:14:28.950 --> 04:14:28.960 align:start position:0%
transparent New Hampshire is a very uh
 
04:14:32.830 --> 04:14:32.840 align:start position:0%
the website is is for transparency and
 
04:14:37.149 --> 04:14:37.159 align:start position:0%
um is um has a bunch of this
 
04:14:40.790 --> 04:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
information um and it's the information
 
04:14:44.189 --> 04:14:44.199 align:start position:0%
is entered by the Legislative legisl of
 
04:14:47.870 --> 04:14:47.880 align:start position:0%
administration um and he with without
 
04:14:51.550 --> 04:14:51.560 align:start position:0%
the um he had not heard about this bill
 
04:14:53.309 --> 04:14:53.319 align:start position:0%
like it had not gone through the course
 
04:14:55.149 --> 04:14:55.159 align:start position:0%
of trying to get this information
 
04:14:59.710 --> 04:14:59.720 align:start position:0%
through that website um but he is not
 
04:15:02.630 --> 04:15:02.640 align:start position:0%
sure about whether there's a spot on on
 
04:15:05.070 --> 04:15:05.080 align:start position:0%
their um inside of their accounting
 
04:15:09.469 --> 04:15:09.479 align:start position:0%
software so that uh that you know the uh
 
04:15:11.830 --> 04:15:11.840 align:start position:0%
vendor of the municipality could be
 
04:15:15.630 --> 04:15:15.640 align:start position:0%
marked as as a a a municipality and then
 
04:15:17.550 --> 04:15:17.560 align:start position:0%
because my vision was essentially just
 
04:15:19.910 --> 04:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
have all municipalities kind of like a
 
04:15:21.510 --> 04:15:21.520 align:start position:0%
link to just a place where there's
 
04:15:23.469 --> 04:15:23.479 align:start position:0%
municipalities and you can look pick any
 
04:15:25.229 --> 04:15:25.239 align:start position:0%
municipality and it would just list all
 
04:15:27.550 --> 04:15:27.560 align:start position:0%
of the things and then then the
 
04:15:30.269 --> 04:15:30.279 align:start position:0%
municipality could just put a link to
 
04:15:32.429 --> 04:15:32.439 align:start position:0%
their website like it would be new
 
04:15:36.710 --> 04:15:36.720 align:start position:0%
hampsh NH transparency. goov Freemont or
 
04:15:38.349 --> 04:15:38.359 align:start position:0%
whatever and it would just be a
 
04:15:40.550 --> 04:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
permanent link that you could just go
 
04:15:43.389 --> 04:15:43.399 align:start position:0%
and see whatever um money you got from
 
04:15:45.189 --> 04:15:45.199 align:start position:0%
from the state and it would essentially
 
04:15:48.149 --> 04:15:48.159 align:start position:0%
require no upkeep by the municipality
 
04:15:50.550 --> 04:15:50.560 align:start position:0%
but this has
 
04:15:53.990 --> 04:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
just apparently been not really thought
 
04:15:58.469 --> 04:15:58.479 align:start position:0%
of and actually the director um kind of
 
04:16:00.349 --> 04:16:00.359 align:start position:0%
indicated that he preferred it be
 
04:16:02.790 --> 04:16:02.800 align:start position:0%
handled by the state since we have all
 
04:16:05.149 --> 04:16:05.159 align:start position:0%
the information and municipalities are
 
04:16:06.790 --> 04:16:06.800 align:start position:0%
not very reliable it's not going to be
 
04:16:08.349 --> 04:16:08.359 align:start position:0%
put up the way that we wanted and stuff
 
04:16:11.750 --> 04:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
like that and so it I think that this
 
04:16:13.950 --> 04:16:13.960 align:start position:0%
committee should hold off on this and
 
04:16:16.870 --> 04:16:16.880 align:start position:0%
and I will work with the Department of
 
04:16:18.910 --> 04:16:18.920 align:start position:0%
legislative Administration and the
 
04:16:24.830 --> 04:16:24.840 align:start position:0%
depart the department of uh it uh doit
 
04:16:28.469 --> 04:16:28.479 align:start position:0%
and we will you know work on it trying
 
04:16:30.550 --> 04:16:30.560 align:start position:0%
to get that implemented and if there is
 
04:16:32.630 --> 04:16:32.640 align:start position:0%
Need for legislative solution that we
 
04:16:35.670 --> 04:16:35.680 align:start position:0%
can offer that in the next term um but I
 
04:16:37.389 --> 04:16:37.399 align:start position:0%
don't think that this is absolutely
 
04:16:39.429 --> 04:16:39.439 align:start position:0%
critical that we do it now and that we
 
04:16:42.429 --> 04:16:42.439 align:start position:0%
impose that burden on the municipalities
 
04:16:44.950 --> 04:16:44.960 align:start position:0%
it's possible that we could just s do
 
04:16:46.790 --> 04:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
this at the state level and have
 
04:16:49.030 --> 04:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
essentially very little to no burden on
 
04:16:51.309 --> 04:16:51.319 align:start position:0%
the municipality so I would just offer
 
04:16:53.590 --> 04:16:53.600 align:start position:0%
that for your consideration uh thank you
 
04:16:53.600 --> 04:16:54.469 align:start position:0%
that for your consideration uh thank you
Mr

04:16:54.469 --> 04:16:54.479 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
04:16:57.189 --> 04:16:57.199 align:start position:0%
chair thank you representative Hicks
 
04:16:59.790 --> 04:16:59.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um I agree that we
 
04:17:01.309 --> 04:17:01.319 align:start position:0%
need transparency and I think that
 
04:17:03.870 --> 04:17:03.880 align:start position:0%
posting a link is a great way to do it
 
04:17:08.189 --> 04:17:08.199 align:start position:0%
um and I think that if posting a link
 
04:17:10.590 --> 04:17:10.600 align:start position:0%
would satisfy this then I think it's a
 
04:17:13.070 --> 04:17:13.080 align:start position:0%
wonderful idea um so I'm going to vote
 
04:17:16.189 --> 04:17:16.199 align:start position:0%
for the bill um as amended and hope that
 
04:17:18.309 --> 04:17:18.319 align:start position:0%
that link will satisfy the requirement
 
04:17:18.319 --> 04:17:20.149 align:start position:0%
that link will satisfy the requirement
for

04:17:20.149 --> 04:17:20.159 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:17:24.469 --> 04:17:24.479 align:start position:0%

04:17:51.990 --> 04:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:17:54.189 --> 04:17:54.199 align:start position:0%
newspaper we actually do most of this
 
04:17:57.750 --> 04:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
already on our website um I mean the
 
04:18:00.830 --> 04:18:00.840 align:start position:0%
goal of of the budget process is to pass
 
04:18:03.630 --> 04:18:03.640 align:start position:0%
the budget and so the more information a
 
04:18:05.510 --> 04:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
budget is more than just numbers it's a
 
04:18:08.590 --> 04:18:08.600 align:start position:0%
story and so providing this information
 
04:18:10.309 --> 04:18:10.319 align:start position:0%
to the community really helps you
 
04:18:12.950 --> 04:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
formulate the story as you go into to
 
04:18:14.830 --> 04:18:14.840 align:start position:0%
the budget process and and you really
 
04:18:17.189 --> 04:18:17.199 align:start position:0%
want the community it also builds trust
 
04:18:18.590 --> 04:18:18.600 align:start position:0%
with the community when they can see
 
04:18:20.469 --> 04:18:20.479 align:start position:0%
everything that's going on and I think
 
04:18:22.550 --> 04:18:22.560 align:start position:0%
the added benefit really is is you
 
04:18:25.870 --> 04:18:25.880 align:start position:0%
really do want to show what the state is
 
04:18:27.349 --> 04:18:27.359 align:start position:0%
giving you because it lets the
 
04:18:29.910 --> 04:18:29.920 align:start position:0%
municipality know how little it is and
 
04:18:31.710 --> 04:18:31.720 align:start position:0%
it it shows how they've shifted the
 
04:18:34.070 --> 04:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
burden to municipalities to carry this
 
04:18:36.830 --> 04:18:36.840 align:start position:0%
out specifically as they downloaded the
 
04:18:40.550 --> 04:18:40.560 align:start position:0%
retirement uh funding to us and so by
 
04:18:43.030 --> 04:18:43.040 align:start position:0%
stating that it helps us as voters when
 
04:18:45.630 --> 04:18:45.640 align:start position:0%
we think about our legislature so I I'll
 
04:18:49.030 --> 04:18:49.040 align:start position:0%
support it representative kill thank you
 
04:18:51.510 --> 04:18:51.520 align:start position:0%
Mr chair um you know I got this bag of
 
04:18:53.590 --> 04:18:53.600 align:start position:0%
M&amp;M's right here and it's got different
 
04:18:57.429 --> 04:18:57.439 align:start position:0%
color M&amp;M's red green yellow we all
 
04:18:59.469 --> 04:18:59.479 align:start position:0%
retain and get information in different
 
04:19:01.790 --> 04:19:01.800 align:start position:0%
ways and I totally respect
 
04:19:03.870 --> 04:19:03.880 align:start position:0%
representative y's points on this I'll
 
04:19:06.910 --> 04:19:06.920 align:start position:0%
be voting for this bill and for the like
 
04:19:08.550 --> 04:19:08.560 align:start position:0%
we voted for the amendment and and
 
04:19:11.870 --> 04:19:11.880 align:start position:0%
hopefully we can fix on the floor um the
 
04:19:13.469 --> 04:19:13.479 align:start position:0%
one small issue
 
04:19:15.830 --> 04:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
but I think it it better serves us if
 
04:19:17.590 --> 04:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
we're presenting information in multiple
 
04:19:18.750 --> 04:19:18.760 align:start position:0%
different ways I think it's great that
 
04:19:21.189 --> 04:19:21.199 align:start position:0%
we have the state archive or whatever
 
04:19:24.990 --> 04:19:25.000 align:start position:0%
but it will be very good for for the
 
04:19:26.670 --> 04:19:26.680 align:start position:0%
employees of the town and the citizens
 
04:19:28.830 --> 04:19:28.840 align:start position:0%
of the town to have this information
 
04:19:32.269 --> 04:19:32.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:35.510 --> 04:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
suggested had representative Gallagher
 
04:19:41.309 --> 04:19:41.319 align:start position:0%
n um so I um I I don't really
 
04:19:44.950 --> 04:19:44.960 align:start position:0%
necessarily um oppose the idea behind
 
04:19:48.950 --> 04:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
this bill um yeah I I genely support um
 
04:19:50.710 --> 04:19:50.720 align:start position:0%
transparency I
 
04:19:53.710 --> 04:19:53.720 align:start position:0%
was actually considering draft getting
 
04:19:56.309 --> 04:19:56.319 align:start position:0%
my own Amendment drafted to it though
 
04:19:58.830 --> 04:19:58.840 align:start position:0%
which unfortunately I I'd wanted to meet
 
04:20:01.750 --> 04:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
with someone from um the education
 
04:20:03.429 --> 04:20:03.439 align:start position:0%
committee about it but just didn't get
 
04:20:07.389 --> 04:20:07.399 align:start position:0%
around to it in time um yeah some things
 
04:20:10.790 --> 04:20:10.800 align:start position:0%
that I would have wanted to change um
 
04:20:13.630 --> 04:20:13.640 align:start position:0%
that if if I I on this amendment would
 
04:20:18.950 --> 04:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
be to increase the um 30 days to say um
 
04:20:21.469 --> 04:20:21.479 align:start position:0%
within 30 days of receipt to say within
 
04:20:25.349 --> 04:20:25.359 align:start position:0%
60 or 90 days of receipt um and I also
 
04:20:29.950 --> 04:20:29.960 align:start position:0%
would have liked to add some language um
 
04:20:32.750 --> 04:20:32.760 align:start position:0%
about making sure that this applies
 
04:20:38.070 --> 04:20:38.080 align:start position:0%
evenly to um public schools and other
 
04:20:41.469 --> 04:20:41.479 align:start position:0%
sorts of Education types that the school
 
04:20:43.630 --> 04:20:43.640 align:start position:0%
provide that the state provides funding
 
04:20:47.830 --> 04:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
for um and then also my usual Tech
 
04:20:51.790 --> 04:20:51.800 align:start position:0%
related stuff um about software freedom
 
04:20:51.800 --> 04:20:53.550 align:start position:0%
related stuff um about software freedom
and

04:20:53.550 --> 04:20:53.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:20:58.149 --> 04:20:58.159 align:start position:0%
um yeah stuff like that um but then
 
04:21:00.030 --> 04:21:00.040 align:start position:0%
again these are all pretty minor
 
04:21:04.790 --> 04:21:04.800 align:start position:0%
nitpicks um I don't think it really
 
04:21:07.870 --> 04:21:07.880 align:start position:0%
leads to Too Much harm if the bill
 
04:21:11.670 --> 04:21:11.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't include those Clauses currently
 
04:21:13.070 --> 04:21:13.080 align:start position:0%
um so
 
04:21:17.349 --> 04:21:17.359 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm I I I think I'll um I think
 
04:21:19.830 --> 04:21:19.840 align:start position:0%
I'll support it anyways even though um
 
04:21:21.189 --> 04:21:21.199 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
04:21:23.670 --> 04:21:23.680 align:start position:0%
perfect representative
 
04:21:26.149 --> 04:21:26.159 align:start position:0%
savus yes well I'm a firm believer in
 
04:21:28.109 --> 04:21:28.119 align:start position:0%
never letting the perfect get in the way
 
04:21:31.389 --> 04:21:31.399 align:start position:0%
of the good um and I see nothing in this
 
04:21:34.469 --> 04:21:34.479 align:start position:0%
bill that precludes municipalities from
 
04:21:37.149 --> 04:21:37.159 align:start position:0%
publishing information about other kinds
 
04:21:39.309 --> 04:21:39.319 align:start position:0%
of educational institutions other than
 
04:21:41.750 --> 04:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
public schools so that's one thing
 
04:21:43.429 --> 04:21:43.439 align:start position:0%
another thing is I have also checked out
 
04:21:45.469 --> 04:21:45.479 align:start position:0%
in research transparent New Hampshire
 
04:21:48.189 --> 04:21:48.199 align:start position:0%
and I find it
 
04:21:51.750 --> 04:21:51.760 align:start position:0%
impenetrable um uh if I wanted to find
 
04:21:54.309 --> 04:21:54.319 align:start position:0%
out what kind of state funds had gone to
 
04:21:56.309 --> 04:21:56.319 align:start position:0%
a certain municipality I don't even know
 
04:21:58.910 --> 04:21:58.920 align:start position:0%
where I'd begin and the other thing is
 
04:22:02.670 --> 04:22:02.680 align:start position:0%
that in Lebanon we do this every day we
 
04:22:06.349 --> 04:22:06.359 align:start position:0%
have a daily update of opportunities and
 
04:22:08.790 --> 04:22:08.800 align:start position:0%
Grant funds that have come in and what
 
04:22:11.070 --> 04:22:11.080 align:start position:0%
and following up on what representative
 
04:22:14.149 --> 04:22:14.159 align:start position:0%
Howland said it does give you the
 
04:22:16.590 --> 04:22:16.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity as a municipality to
 
04:22:19.309 --> 04:22:19.319 align:start position:0%
prioritize what you want to prioritize
 
04:22:21.349 --> 04:22:21.359 align:start position:0%
and not to just link to someone else's
 
04:22:24.590 --> 04:22:24.600 align:start position:0%
page that has their own priorities as to
 
04:22:27.670 --> 04:22:27.680 align:start position:0%
what they list first or second or third
 
04:22:29.389 --> 04:22:29.399 align:start position:0%
uh and it also gives you an opportunity
 
04:22:31.830 --> 04:22:31.840 align:start position:0%
to tell about local people who might
 
04:22:34.750 --> 04:22:34.760 align:start position:0%
have benefited from you know people you
 
04:22:36.309 --> 04:22:36.319 align:start position:0%
may know your neighbors who may have
 
04:22:39.109 --> 04:22:39.119 align:start position:0%
benefited from these funds so um I will
 
04:22:40.870 --> 04:22:40.880 align:start position:0%
be supporting this bill I think it's a
 
04:22:42.950 --> 04:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
step in the right direction I think we
 
04:22:45.590 --> 04:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
can easily fix the 90day thing on the
 
04:22:48.389 --> 04:22:48.399 align:start position:0%
floor if it even needs to be fixed uh it
 
04:22:50.389 --> 04:22:50.399 align:start position:0%
just stuck out to me at the moment but
 
04:22:53.070 --> 04:22:53.080 align:start position:0%
I'm not so sure it's that serious thank
 
04:22:55.149 --> 04:22:55.159 align:start position:0%
you representative Hicks you had another
 
04:22:56.870 --> 04:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
comment yes thank you I apologize for
 
04:22:59.309 --> 04:22:59.319 align:start position:0%
not um thinking about this earlier I
 
04:23:03.030 --> 04:23:03.040 align:start position:0%
think it must be on local municipalities
 
04:23:05.990 --> 04:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
websites people are not going to go most
 
04:23:07.550 --> 04:23:07.560 align:start position:0%
people are not going to go to the state
 
04:23:08.710 --> 04:23:08.720 align:start position:0%
to look for information about their
 
04:23:11.349 --> 04:23:11.359 align:start position:0%
towns or cities further comments
 
04:23:11.359 --> 04:23:13.750 align:start position:0%
towns or cities further comments
representa

04:23:13.750 --> 04:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
representa
 
04:23:15.550 --> 04:23:15.560 align:start position:0%
since I agree with my Democratic
 
04:23:16.950 --> 04:23:16.960 align:start position:0%
counterparts I wanted to make sure they
 
04:23:20.229 --> 04:23:20.239 align:start position:0%
knew that I agreed and say that the that
 
04:23:22.750 --> 04:23:22.760 align:start position:0%
that I've Agreed 100% on this type of
 
04:23:24.750 --> 04:23:24.760 align:start position:0%
thing the transparency and the fact that
 
04:23:26.550 --> 04:23:26.560 align:start position:0%
your information for your town should be
 
04:23:29.269 --> 04:23:29.279 align:start position:0%
on your website so people who don't
 
04:23:31.750 --> 04:23:31.760 align:start position:0%
spend a lot of time researching and
 
04:23:34.030 --> 04:23:34.040 align:start position:0%
looking at this for a town can see where
 
04:23:36.750 --> 04:23:36.760 align:start position:0%
they stand right away and you can just
 
04:23:38.510 --> 04:23:38.520 align:start position:0%
point them when they ask questions about
 
04:23:40.149 --> 04:23:40.159 align:start position:0%
things like this you can just point them
 
04:23:43.070 --> 04:23:43.080 align:start position:0%
to their town website and it's done
 
04:23:45.950 --> 04:23:45.960 align:start position:0%
One-Stop shopping thank you very good
 
04:23:47.469 --> 04:23:47.479 align:start position:0%
represent of
 
04:23:50.229 --> 04:23:50.239 align:start position:0%
Elwood I guess I really have a question
 
04:23:52.550 --> 04:23:52.560 align:start position:0%
because in my
 
04:23:55.830 --> 04:23:55.840 align:start position:0%
town it seems to be such a burden to
 
04:23:57.790 --> 04:23:57.800 align:start position:0%
post anything to the
 
04:24:00.229 --> 04:24:00.239 align:start position:0%
website and I'm getting the impression
 
04:24:01.309 --> 04:24:01.319 align:start position:0%
from our
 
04:24:03.910 --> 04:24:03.920 align:start position:0%
new assistant
 
04:24:03.920 --> 04:24:05.630 align:start position:0%
new assistant
selectman's

04:24:05.630 --> 04:24:05.640 align:start position:0%
selectman's
 
04:24:08.990 --> 04:24:09.000 align:start position:0%
assistant that um she's not trained in
 
04:24:11.550 --> 04:24:11.560 align:start position:0%
how to post a PDF or whatever to the
 
04:24:14.469 --> 04:24:14.479 align:start position:0%
website so what exactly would be
 
04:24:17.389 --> 04:24:17.399 align:start position:0%
required of the
 
04:24:20.349 --> 04:24:20.359 align:start position:0%
municipality to would they have to pay
 
04:24:23.389 --> 04:24:23.399 align:start position:0%
someone to post this information if they
 
04:24:27.189 --> 04:24:27.199 align:start position:0%
don't know how or what is the process
 
04:24:29.550 --> 04:24:29.560 align:start position:0%
does anybody
 
04:24:33.269 --> 04:24:33.279 align:start position:0%
know do anybody want to talk about that
 
04:24:36.429 --> 04:24:36.439 align:start position:0%
representative kahill I I'll address a
 
04:24:38.750 --> 04:24:38.760 align:start position:0%
little bit of that I mean currently
 
04:24:40.910 --> 04:24:40.920 align:start position:0%
right now you have people administering
 
04:24:43.550 --> 04:24:43.560 align:start position:0%
the website that posts when it's time to
 
04:24:46.790 --> 04:24:46.800 align:start position:0%
vote or post when it's trash day or post
 
04:24:49.030 --> 04:24:49.040 align:start position:0%
numerous other Public Notices I think it
 
04:24:51.189 --> 04:24:51.199 align:start position:0%
would be very easy for them to be able
 
04:24:54.429 --> 04:24:54.439 align:start position:0%
to do this um like Beyond easy I I would
 
04:24:57.590 --> 04:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
like to also say I I completely agree
 
04:24:59.750 --> 04:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
with representative stav some of those
 
04:25:01.550 --> 04:25:01.560 align:start position:0%
websites are hard to navigate which is
 
04:25:03.950 --> 04:25:03.960 align:start position:0%
why I brought out the M&amp;M's we all see
 
04:25:05.469 --> 04:25:05.479 align:start position:0%
information and learn information
 
04:25:09.510 --> 04:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
differently and we need easy easy um
 
04:25:12.389 --> 04:25:12.399 align:start position:0%
easier access and I'll agree with
 
04:25:14.790 --> 04:25:14.800 align:start position:0%
representative Hicks and I'll agree with
 
04:25:21.510 --> 04:25:21.520 align:start position:0%

04:27:16.030 --> 04:27:16.040 align:start position:0%
10-minute Break

um next we have Senate Bill 491 relative
 
04:27:22.469 --> 04:27:22.479 align:start position:0%
to authorizing legislative bodies of
 
04:27:24.830 --> 04:27:24.840 align:start position:0%
municipalities to enter into voluntary
 
04:27:28.309 --> 04:27:28.319 align:start position:0%
agreements with owners of private
 
04:27:30.950 --> 04:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
roads representative Brown I understand
 
04:27:34.790 --> 04:27:34.800 align:start position:0%
you might have a motion I do Mrs
 
04:27:38.550 --> 04:27:38.560 align:start position:0%
chairman um basically um I object to
 
04:27:42.149 --> 04:27:42.159 align:start position:0%
this uh Bill primarily because motion
 
04:27:45.469 --> 04:27:45.479 align:start position:0%
can I make the motion sorry gosh so
 
04:27:45.479 --> 04:27:54.149 align:start position:0%
can I make the motion sorry gosh so
jumpy

04:27:54.149 --> 04:27:54.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:57.149 --> 04:27:57.159 align:start position:0%
today make the motion to
 
04:28:01.309 --> 04:28:01.319 align:start position:0%
it very good do we have a second uh
 
04:28:05.910 --> 04:28:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:07.950 --> 04:28:07.960 align:start position:0%
seconds now representative would you
 
04:28:10.189 --> 04:28:10.199 align:start position:0%
like to speak to your bill uh your
 
04:28:12.750 --> 04:28:12.760 align:start position:0%
motion I can't remember anymore
 
04:28:14.309 --> 04:28:14.319 align:start position:0%
actually uh Mr chairman I think the
 
04:28:16.309 --> 04:28:16.319 align:start position:0%
reason why I object to this is uh
 
04:28:17.870 --> 04:28:17.880 align:start position:0%
numerous reasons I don't think the bill
 
04:28:21.149 --> 04:28:21.159 align:start position:0%
was written very clearly I think that uh
 
04:28:23.910 --> 04:28:23.920 align:start position:0%
the one person who testified to this
 
04:28:26.990 --> 04:28:27.000 align:start position:0%
brought up issues with Dees and runoff
 
04:28:28.790 --> 04:28:28.800 align:start position:0%
and those types of things which already
 
04:28:30.790 --> 04:28:30.800 align:start position:0%
covered by regulations should be easily
 
04:28:33.109 --> 04:28:33.119 align:start position:0%
addressed by the uh town of that's an
 
04:28:35.269 --> 04:28:35.279 align:start position:0%
issue I think it sets up potential
 
04:28:38.070 --> 04:28:38.080 align:start position:0%
questions in the future for uh what we
 
04:28:40.189 --> 04:28:40.199 align:start position:0%
know uh we don't want to address and
 
04:28:42.590 --> 04:28:42.600 align:start position:0%
that's the fact that people want
 
04:28:45.790 --> 04:28:45.800 align:start position:0%
townships to take over their private
 
04:28:50.229 --> 04:28:50.239 align:start position:0%
roads um so I think that's
 
04:28:53.030 --> 04:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
enough okay further comments
 
04:28:55.550 --> 04:28:55.560 align:start position:0%
representative Holland so full
 
04:28:58.149 --> 04:28:58.159 align:start position:0%
disclosure I have a a three season cabin
 
04:29:01.229 --> 04:29:01.239 align:start position:0%
down a private road and I couldn't quite
 
04:29:03.229 --> 04:29:03.239 align:start position:0%
figure out especially in the testimony
 
04:29:04.910 --> 04:29:04.920 align:start position:0%
where the person was coming up and he I
 
04:29:07.149 --> 04:29:07.159 align:start position:0%
I assumed he was talking about runoff
 
04:29:09.149 --> 04:29:09.159 align:start position:0%
and last year we did have some really
 
04:29:11.269 --> 04:29:11.279 align:start position:0%
epic torrential rains that caused a lot
 
04:29:12.550 --> 04:29:12.560 align:start position:0%
of runoff
 
04:29:15.510 --> 04:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
but but most of the areas that to
 
04:29:17.710 --> 04:29:17.720 align:start position:0%
mitigate it are all private property and
 
04:29:20.309 --> 04:29:20.319 align:start position:0%
the road letting the town work on the
 
04:29:22.790 --> 04:29:22.800 align:start position:0%
road wouldn't fix any of the runoff on
 
04:29:25.590 --> 04:29:25.600 align:start position:0%
the private property and and the second
 
04:29:27.870 --> 04:29:27.880 align:start position:0%
thing is I know everybody keeps saying
 
04:29:29.950 --> 04:29:29.960 align:start position:0%
that we want the towns to take over our
 
04:29:32.429 --> 04:29:32.439 align:start position:0%
private road but actually we we on our
 
04:29:34.229 --> 04:29:34.239 align:start position:0%
private we don't want the state to take
 
04:29:35.830 --> 04:29:35.840 align:start position:0%
over our private road we're perfectly
 
04:29:38.109 --> 04:29:38.119 align:start position:0%
happy with the way it is we collect
 
04:29:40.990 --> 04:29:41.000 align:start position:0%
money we maintain it and we really the
 
04:29:42.469 --> 04:29:42.479 align:start position:0%
only people we want coming down our
 
04:29:44.510 --> 04:29:44.520 align:start position:0%
private road the people who live on our
 
04:29:44.520 --> 04:29:46.630 align:start position:0%
private road the people who live on our
private

04:29:46.630 --> 04:29:46.640 align:start position:0%
private
 
04:29:50.309 --> 04:29:50.319 align:start position:0%
road representative uh Elward thank you
 
04:29:53.950 --> 04:29:53.960 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and full disclosure I reside
 
04:29:58.070 --> 04:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
on a private road um a six lot
 
04:30:00.590 --> 04:30:00.600 align:start position:0%
subdivision and it's very private and we
 
04:30:04.550 --> 04:30:04.560 align:start position:0%
want to keep it that way um but the
 
04:30:07.670 --> 04:30:07.680 align:start position:0%
language using
 
04:30:12.710 --> 04:30:12.720 align:start position:0%
um authorizing the legislative body
 
04:30:15.710 --> 04:30:15.720 align:start position:0%
um to enter into voluntary agreements
 
04:30:18.309 --> 04:30:18.319 align:start position:0%
with owners of private roads I believe
 
04:30:18.319 --> 04:30:19.070 align:start position:0%
with owners of private roads I believe
is

04:30:19.070 --> 04:30:19.080 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:30:22.630 --> 04:30:22.640 align:start position:0%
incorrect it would be the governing body
 
04:30:26.070 --> 04:30:26.080 align:start position:0%
that would actually contract with the
 
04:30:29.710 --> 04:30:29.720 align:start position:0%
private with the owners of private roads
 
04:30:32.550 --> 04:30:32.560 align:start position:0%
not the voters
 
04:30:32.560 --> 04:30:39.710 align:start position:0%
not the voters
Contracting

04:30:39.710 --> 04:30:39.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:42.469 --> 04:30:42.479 align:start position:0%
with I'm sorry there's just discussions
 
04:30:44.309 --> 04:30:44.319 align:start position:0%
going on all over the place and I I'm
 
04:30:46.510 --> 04:30:46.520 align:start position:0%
hearing voices and I can't think
 
04:30:49.109 --> 04:30:49.119 align:start position:0%
straight when people are talking
 
04:30:51.630 --> 04:30:51.640 align:start position:0%
continue so anyway I believe the
 
04:30:54.030 --> 04:30:54.040 align:start position:0%
language is an error using the word
 
04:30:54.040 --> 04:30:56.229 align:start position:0%
language is an error using the word
legislative

04:30:56.229 --> 04:30:56.239 align:start position:0%
legislative
 
04:30:59.750 --> 04:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
body representative PRI thank you Mr
 
04:31:02.870 --> 04:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
chairman I will be supporting uh this
 
04:31:06.389 --> 04:31:06.399 align:start position:0%
bill because um I'm I'm sorry I will be
 
04:31:09.030 --> 04:31:09.040 align:start position:0%
opposing this bill because I think there
 
04:31:11.950 --> 04:31:11.960 align:start position:0%
is unintended consequences that will AR
 
04:31:15.910 --> 04:31:15.920 align:start position:0%
rise because of it this bill was created
 
04:31:20.229 --> 04:31:20.239 align:start position:0%
for one particular property owner um who
 
04:31:22.389 --> 04:31:22.399 align:start position:0%
owns property and maybe develops
 
04:31:24.990 --> 04:31:25.000 align:start position:0%
property on a private road and he's
 
04:31:29.590 --> 04:31:29.600 align:start position:0%
trying to get the the town to take over
 
04:31:35.269 --> 04:31:35.279 align:start position:0%
the management and the um maintenance of
 
04:31:38.070 --> 04:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
this road and I think it doesn't really
 
04:31:42.229 --> 04:31:42.239 align:start position:0%
address all the issues that will be
 
04:31:46.590 --> 04:31:46.600 align:start position:0%
arising from the enactment of this Bill
 
04:31:51.429 --> 04:31:51.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:54.910 --> 04:31:54.920 align:start position:0%
Kella thank you Mr chair um I'm going to
 
04:31:57.710 --> 04:31:57.720 align:start position:0%
be opposing this bill mainly because
 
04:32:00.790 --> 04:32:00.800 align:start position:0%
it's a um inserting new
 
04:32:03.990 --> 04:32:04.000 align:start position:0%
language and there was a Supreme Court
 
04:32:04.000 --> 04:32:05.950 align:start position:0%
language and there was a Supreme Court
decision

04:32:05.950 --> 04:32:05.960 align:start position:0%
decision
 
04:32:12.309 --> 04:32:12.319 align:start position:0%
about um you know ownership and and uh
 
04:32:15.830 --> 04:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
their decision was based on New
 
04:32:20.670 --> 04:32:20.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law as it has to be and
 
04:32:24.189 --> 04:32:24.199 align:start position:0%
so if you want to
 
04:32:24.199 --> 04:32:26.349 align:start position:0%
so if you want to
clarify

04:32:26.349 --> 04:32:26.359 align:start position:0%
clarify
 
04:32:30.309 --> 04:32:30.319 align:start position:0%
whatever um statute that they relied on
 
04:32:33.750 --> 04:32:33.760 align:start position:0%
to to say like hey there's a opportunity
 
04:32:35.870 --> 04:32:35.880 align:start position:0%
for them to maintain it but not take
 
04:32:38.349 --> 04:32:38.359 align:start position:0%
ownership of it or something like that
 
04:32:42.189 --> 04:32:42.199 align:start position:0%
then it would need to amend the law that
 
04:32:44.830 --> 04:32:44.840 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court based its ruling on
 
04:32:48.070 --> 04:32:48.080 align:start position:0%
and so because it's inserting new
 
04:32:52.269 --> 04:32:52.279 align:start position:0%
legislation and um not really addressing
 
04:32:56.910 --> 04:32:56.920 align:start position:0%
what the the law was based on I uh in
 
04:32:59.630 --> 04:32:59.640 align:start position:0%
addition to the confusing language I'm I
 
04:33:02.349 --> 04:33:02.359 align:start position:0%
think that they need to do more research
 
04:33:06.551 --> 04:33:06.561 align:start position:0%
on the uh that Supreme Court law or
 
04:33:09.150 --> 04:33:09.160 align:start position:0%
basis for the Supreme Court ruling and
 
04:33:12.390 --> 04:33:12.400 align:start position:0%
amend the law that it was based on so
 
04:33:12.400 --> 04:33:14.310 align:start position:0%
amend the law that it was based on so
thank

04:33:14.310 --> 04:33:14.320 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:33:17.150 --> 04:33:17.160 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
04:33:21.150 --> 04:33:21.160 align:start position:0%
Gallagher um so I also oppose this bill
 
04:33:23.990 --> 04:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
but in kind of from the opposite
 
04:33:27.590 --> 04:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
direction um from most of the previous
 
04:33:31.189 --> 04:33:31.199 align:start position:0%
um people who have spoken um most people
 
04:33:34.029 --> 04:33:34.039 align:start position:0%
so far have said something to the effect
 
04:33:36.029 --> 04:33:36.039 align:start position:0%
of we don't want municipalities taking
 
04:33:38.869 --> 04:33:38.879 align:start position:0%
over private roads um I do want
 
04:33:41.429 --> 04:33:41.439 align:start position:0%
municipalities taking over private roads
 
04:33:44.590 --> 04:33:44.600 align:start position:0%
but I think that when they do that they
 
04:33:47.470 --> 04:33:47.480 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be private anymore this whole
 
04:33:49.990 --> 04:33:50.000 align:start position:0%
thing of oh the municipality is going to
 
04:33:53.109 --> 04:33:53.119 align:start position:0%
be on the hook for it but it's still
 
04:33:57.150 --> 04:33:57.160 align:start position:0%
going to be private anyways um just
 
04:34:00.949 --> 04:34:00.959 align:start position:0%
doesn't really cut it for me um
 
04:34:04.590 --> 04:34:04.600 align:start position:0%
so yeah I that that is my separate
 
04:34:06.670 --> 04:34:06.680 align:start position:0%
reason for opposing
 
04:34:10.029 --> 04:34:10.039 align:start position:0%
it representative Brown thank you Mr
 
04:34:12.709 --> 04:34:12.719 align:start position:0%
chairman uh like the rest of the people
 
04:34:14.990 --> 04:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
who spoke full disclosure I live on a
 
04:34:17.310 --> 04:34:17.320 align:start position:0%
private road with five other people as
 
04:34:20.230 --> 04:34:20.240 align:start position:0%
well and I I want to uh Echo
 
04:34:22.230 --> 04:34:22.240 align:start position:0%
representative priest comment in that
 
04:34:25.070 --> 04:34:25.080 align:start position:0%
that we had one person who testified for
 
04:34:29.109 --> 04:34:29.119 align:start position:0%
this and no towns spoke in favor of
 
04:34:32.709 --> 04:34:32.719 align:start position:0%
doing this thank you representative uh
 
04:34:35.029 --> 04:34:35.039 align:start position:0%
power thank you Mr chairman I'll just
 
04:34:37.269 --> 04:34:37.279 align:start position:0%
briefly comment that it's my
 
04:34:38.949 --> 04:34:38.959 align:start position:0%
understanding that this bill doesn't
 
04:34:42.269 --> 04:34:42.279 align:start position:0%
allow for anything new to
 
04:34:45.189 --> 04:34:45.199 align:start position:0%
be able to be done that can't already be
 
04:34:47.750 --> 04:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
done in statute for example there's
 
04:34:49.750 --> 04:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
already Provisions in law that the
 
04:34:52.349 --> 04:34:52.359 align:start position:0%
governing body can enter into an
 
04:34:55.029 --> 04:34:55.039 align:start position:0%
agreement um to do some of the stuff
 
04:34:57.990 --> 04:34:58.000 align:start position:0%
that this um Bill potentially seeks to
 
04:35:01.150 --> 04:35:01.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:04.310 --> 04:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
furthermore a municipality is already
 
04:35:08.230 --> 04:35:08.240 align:start position:0%
enabled to say plow a driveway where the
 
04:35:10.750 --> 04:35:10.760 align:start position:0%
resident has called for an ambulance and
 
04:35:15.189 --> 04:35:15.199 align:start position:0%
that's on a per case basis as needed in
 
04:35:15.199 --> 04:35:16.349 align:start position:0%
that's on a per case basis as needed in
the

04:35:16.349 --> 04:35:16.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:35:19.670 --> 04:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
emergency and um the last comment that
 
04:35:21.429 --> 04:35:21.439 align:start position:0%
I'll make is I find that the wording of
 
04:35:24.670 --> 04:35:24.680 align:start position:0%
the bill is is is is poor and it's
 
04:35:27.470 --> 04:35:27.480 align:start position:0%
confusing and with regards to um the
 
04:35:29.470 --> 04:35:29.480 align:start position:0%
first sentence legislative bodies
 
04:35:31.830 --> 04:35:31.840 align:start position:0%
entering into
 
04:35:34.590 --> 04:35:34.600 align:start position:0%
agreements um what that is referring to
 
04:35:36.629 --> 04:35:36.639 align:start position:0%
is that that agreement would be approved
 
04:35:40.189 --> 04:35:40.199 align:start position:0%
by a warrant article somewhat confusing
 
04:35:45.390 --> 04:35:45.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:45.400 --> 04:35:52.709 align:start position:0%
 
further

would you like to speak to your
 
04:47:11.510 --> 04:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
Amendment yes thank you Mr chairman um
 
04:47:14.670 --> 04:47:14.680 align:start position:0%
the Senate was um informed that an
 
04:47:17.670 --> 04:47:17.680 align:start position:0%
amendment was in order and it's a very
 
04:47:21.070 --> 04:47:21.080 align:start position:0%
simple Amendment um to clarify a couple
 
04:47:22.430 --> 04:47:22.440 align:start position:0%
of things
 
04:47:26.190 --> 04:47:26.200 align:start position:0%
Unfortunately they um punted and said
 
04:47:27.670 --> 04:47:27.680 align:start position:0%
that I could take care of it when the
 
04:47:30.310 --> 04:47:30.320 align:start position:0%
bill came here to the house so
 
04:47:33.190 --> 04:47:33.200 align:start position:0%
apparently I'm their secretary so
 
04:47:35.430 --> 04:47:35.440 align:start position:0%
nevertheless there's um two simple
 
04:47:38.750 --> 04:47:38.760 align:start position:0%
changes in line six in the original bill
 
04:47:40.948 --> 04:47:40.958 align:start position:0%
as presented there was the word adopted
 
04:47:43.230 --> 04:47:43.240 align:start position:0%
and that's changed to the word current
 
04:47:47.548 --> 04:47:47.558 align:start position:0%
and the reason is is that the first year
 
04:47:50.350 --> 04:47:50.360 align:start position:0%
um the adopted per pupil cost that that
 
04:47:52.190 --> 04:47:52.200 align:start position:0%
that's what's adopted for the first year
 
04:47:55.030 --> 04:47:55.040 align:start position:0%
but in years thereafter it's it's really
 
04:47:57.030 --> 04:47:57.040 align:start position:0%
the current per pupil cost so that just
 
04:48:01.948 --> 04:48:01.958 align:start position:0%
adds Clarity and then the in lines 9
 
04:48:06.110 --> 04:48:06.120 align:start position:0%
through 12 there was just the addition
 
04:48:08.628 --> 04:48:08.638 align:start position:0%
of a couple of sentences to further
 
04:48:12.190 --> 04:48:12.200 align:start position:0%
clarify that um regards to the
 
04:48:14.910 --> 04:48:14.920 align:start position:0%
calculation um that the current per
 
04:48:17.948 --> 04:48:17.958 align:start position:0%
pupil cost is is compounded year after
 
04:48:21.510 --> 04:48:21.520 align:start position:0%
year and so those um sentences there
 
04:48:25.110 --> 04:48:25.120 align:start position:0%
just further clarify I I um would urge
 
04:48:27.910 --> 04:48:27.920 align:start position:0%
the committee to um accept this
 
04:48:30.270 --> 04:48:30.280 align:start position:0%
amendment for for clarity purposes thank

representa

04:50:45.788 --> 04:50:45.798 align:start position:0%
representa
 
04:50:48.830 --> 04:50:48.840 align:start position:0%
soles thank you Mr chairman and I just
 
04:50:51.708 --> 04:50:51.718 align:start position:0%
wanted to share with my colleagues uh as
 
04:50:54.150 --> 04:50:54.160 align:start position:0%
a former selectman in the town of
 
04:50:59.070 --> 04:50:59.080 align:start position:0%
Lichfield we have a uh uh a spending cap
 
04:51:01.708 --> 04:51:01.718 align:start position:0%
and it had a restriction that it could
 
04:51:06.708 --> 04:51:06.718 align:start position:0%
only go up a finite amount every every
 
04:51:12.628 --> 04:51:12.638 align:start position:0%
uh year and we wished that we had the
 
04:51:16.270 --> 04:51:16.280 align:start position:0%
option of tying it to some
 
04:51:21.230 --> 04:51:21.240 align:start position:0%
inflationary uh index so it could it
 
04:51:25.030 --> 04:51:25.040 align:start position:0%
could go up based upon that and so this
 
04:51:27.670 --> 04:51:27.680 align:start position:0%
is a step in the right direction and it
 
04:51:30.788 --> 04:51:30.798 align:start position:0%
it would have made things a lot better
 
04:51:35.350 --> 04:51:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:37.390 --> 04:51:37.400 align:start position:0%
budgeting representative
 
04:51:39.868 --> 04:51:39.878 align:start position:0%
PRI thank you Mr chairman I will be
 
04:51:42.350 --> 04:51:42.360 align:start position:0%
voting against this bill and the
 
04:51:45.470 --> 04:51:45.480 align:start position:0%
amendment I appreciate the uh effort
 
04:51:49.990 --> 04:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
that representative power has made on uh
 
04:51:53.430 --> 04:51:53.440 align:start position:0%
trying to clarify um language in this
 
04:51:56.628 --> 04:51:56.638 align:start position:0%
document but I'm just opposed with tax
 
04:52:00.910 --> 04:52:00.920 align:start position:0%
cuts caps because of the fact that the
 
04:52:04.910 --> 04:52:04.920 align:start position:0%
localities pay the cost pay the burden
 
04:52:09.030 --> 04:52:09.040 align:start position:0%
if they have an economic downturn or if
 
04:52:12.948 --> 04:52:12.958 align:start position:0%
something um unusual happens like we had
 
04:52:14.750 --> 04:52:14.760 align:start position:0%
with the pandemic where there's a loss
 
04:52:19.190 --> 04:52:19.200 align:start position:0%
of jobs and revenue and they are held
 
04:52:22.990 --> 04:52:23.000 align:start position:0%
you know trying to provide services to
 
04:52:25.350 --> 04:52:25.360 align:start position:0%
the uh to their people and their
 
04:52:27.708 --> 04:52:27.718 align:start position:0%
businesses and I just think it
 
04:52:31.990 --> 04:52:32.000 align:start position:0%
hampers um local governments so I and I
 
04:52:34.510 --> 04:52:34.520 align:start position:0%
know that this enabling and I appreciate
 
04:52:36.990 --> 04:52:37.000 align:start position:0%
that but I still am opposed to the
 
04:52:40.190 --> 04:52:40.200 align:start position:0%
entire concept thank you thank you f the
 
04:52:40.200 --> 04:52:40.990 align:start position:0%
entire concept thank you thank you f the
comment

04:52:40.990 --> 04:52:41.000 align:start position:0%
comment
 
04:52:44.270 --> 04:52:44.280 align:start position:0%
representa K I think this is a fantastic
 
04:52:47.548 --> 04:52:47.558 align:start position:0%
uh bill being fiscally responsible for
 
04:52:49.590 --> 04:52:49.600 align:start position:0%
our um for our constituents is
 
04:52:50.868 --> 04:52:50.878 align:start position:0%
definitely the right thing to do with
 
04:52:53.310 --> 04:52:53.320 align:start position:0%
all with the current economic situation
 
04:52:54.948 --> 04:52:54.958 align:start position:0%
um a lot of people are concerned with
 
04:52:57.350 --> 04:52:57.360 align:start position:0%
the um overspending of our government
 
04:52:58.670 --> 04:52:58.680 align:start position:0%
and you look at our federal level it's
 
04:53:00.990 --> 04:53:01.000 align:start position:0%
pretty insane uh if we if we only had a
 
04:53:03.270 --> 04:53:03.280 align:start position:0%
tax cap on our federal spending it would
 
04:53:05.230 --> 04:53:05.240 align:start position:0%
it would be amazing for us right now I
 
04:53:07.910 --> 04:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
think um so I definitely will be voting
 
04:53:10.948 --> 04:53:10.958 align:start position:0%
in favor of of the bill thank you
 
04:53:14.510 --> 04:53:14.520 align:start position:0%
further comments representative uh maor
 
04:53:16.430 --> 04:53:16.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um I'm going to be
 
04:53:18.070 --> 04:53:18.080 align:start position:0%
voting against the bill I I really don't
 
04:53:20.310 --> 04:53:20.320 align:start position:0%
have a problem with with the with the
 
04:53:22.190 --> 04:53:22.200 align:start position:0%
calculator because I actually do support
 
04:53:25.868 --> 04:53:25.878 align:start position:0%
the idea of tying a creating a calculus
 
04:53:29.190 --> 04:53:29.200 align:start position:0%
and using uh CPI that's what we do when
 
04:53:31.270 --> 04:53:31.280 align:start position:0%
we do our our contracts in town because
 
04:53:33.948 --> 04:53:33.958 align:start position:0%
you need something to base it off of uh
 
04:53:35.510 --> 04:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
and something that everyone can seek
 
04:53:37.548 --> 04:53:37.558 align:start position:0%
their sink their teeth into where my
 
04:53:40.470 --> 04:53:40.480 align:start position:0%
concern is is in the beginning in in
 
04:53:43.150 --> 04:53:43.160 align:start position:0%
lines four and five uh and it's because
 
04:53:45.390 --> 04:53:45.400 align:start position:0%
Northampton did that several years ago
 
04:53:47.390 --> 04:53:47.400 align:start position:0%
we included the tax impact on all of our
 
04:53:49.590 --> 04:53:49.600 align:start position:0%
warrant articles as we put them on there
 
04:53:52.830 --> 04:53:52.840 align:start position:0%
and what happened is uh that we did not
 
04:53:54.750 --> 04:53:54.760 align:start position:0%
we could not over the course of I think
 
04:53:57.270 --> 04:53:57.280 align:start position:0%
it was three years represent the full
 
04:53:59.590 --> 04:53:59.600 align:start position:0%
impact because if you pass seven but not
 
04:54:02.070 --> 04:54:02.080 align:start position:0%
eight if you pass Six and not you know
 
04:54:05.430 --> 04:54:05.440 align:start position:0%
and not nine what does that mean for us
 
04:54:07.590 --> 04:54:07.600 align:start position:0%
and and I I it created a problem in
 
04:54:09.150 --> 04:54:09.160 align:start position:0%
Northampton I think it might create
 
04:54:11.030 --> 04:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
problems in other communities and for
 
04:54:13.910 --> 04:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
that reason um I I I don't support that
 
04:54:15.510 --> 04:54:15.520 align:start position:0%
piece so I'm not supporting the bill but
 
04:54:18.030 --> 04:54:18.040 align:start position:0%
I do think the calculus is a good idea
 
04:54:18.040 --> 04:54:20.830 align:start position:0%
I do think the calculus is a good idea
thank

04:54:20.830 --> 04:54:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:23.750 --> 04:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
you further
 
04:54:26.708 --> 04:54:26.718 align:start position:0%
comments representative power thank you
 
04:54:28.868 --> 04:54:28.878 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
 
04:54:31.868 --> 04:54:31.878 align:start position:0%
um with regards to the comment that my
 
04:54:34.788 --> 04:54:34.798 align:start position:0%
colleague just made on page one lines
 
04:54:37.708 --> 04:54:37.718 align:start position:0%
four and five of the bill that language
 
04:54:41.470 --> 04:54:41.480 align:start position:0%
is the same language that was um
 
04:54:43.628 --> 04:54:43.638 align:start position:0%
contained in a bill and unfortunately I
 
04:54:45.070 --> 04:54:45.080 align:start position:0%
was the Prime sponsor and I don't
 
04:54:47.310 --> 04:54:47.320 align:start position:0%
remember the bill number Bill numbers
 
04:54:51.590 --> 04:54:51.600 align:start position:0%
blur um for me at this point but knowing
 
04:54:54.590 --> 04:54:54.600 align:start position:0%
that that bill passed um the
 
04:54:58.070 --> 04:54:58.080 align:start position:0%
house I wanted to make sure because this
 
04:55:01.590 --> 04:55:01.600 align:start position:0%
bill here addressed local tax caps I
 
04:55:03.390 --> 04:55:03.400 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure that that same
 
04:55:07.230 --> 04:55:07.240 align:start position:0%
language was was also in this um bill
 
04:55:09.830 --> 04:55:09.840 align:start position:0%
that's before us so this isn't anything
 
04:55:13.788 --> 04:55:13.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:17.910 --> 04:55:17.920 align:start position:0%

second that's you
 
04:58:36.670 --> 04:58:36.680 align:start position:0%

04:58:40.390 --> 04:58:40.400 align:start position:0%
lales and representative Brown would you
 
04:58:43.030 --> 04:58:43.040 align:start position:0%
like to speak to your bill I wouldn't Mr
 
04:58:45.750 --> 04:58:45.760 align:start position:0%
chair I I wouldn't Mr chairman there's
 
04:58:48.190 --> 04:58:48.200 align:start position:0%
uh several things that concern me during
 
04:58:51.470 --> 04:58:51.480 align:start position:0%
testimony of this bill and uh part of it
 
04:58:53.708 --> 04:58:53.718 align:start position:0%
was the fact that uh the property tax
 
04:58:56.150 --> 04:58:56.160 align:start position:0%
relief that could be granted uh even
 
04:58:57.948 --> 04:58:57.958 align:start position:0%
though it says it's a
 
04:59:01.270 --> 04:59:01.280 align:start position:0%
one-time uh period uh it could be
 
04:59:03.190 --> 04:59:03.200 align:start position:0%
granted for a number of years and I
 
04:59:05.910 --> 04:59:05.920 align:start position:0%
think they said up to 13 but I don't see
 
04:59:08.190 --> 04:59:08.200 align:start position:0%
where it would be uh where they could
 
04:59:11.510 --> 04:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
restrict it uh at all up to the 20e time
 
04:59:14.390 --> 04:59:14.400 align:start position:0%
period the other issues that I that I
 
04:59:18.628 --> 04:59:18.638 align:start position:0%
have with this are excuse me get to my
 
04:59:21.390 --> 04:59:21.400 align:start position:0%
notes when I asked about the uh Park
 
04:59:25.230 --> 04:59:25.240 align:start position:0%
parking issues um having U Been a civil
 
04:59:27.150 --> 04:59:27.160 align:start position:0%
engineering project manager on numerous
 
04:59:29.750 --> 04:59:29.760 align:start position:0%
proog projects around the world parking
 
04:59:33.510 --> 04:59:33.520 align:start position:0%
is always a touchy issue and uh where
 
04:59:36.670 --> 04:59:36.680 align:start position:0%
this is so open I have concerns about
 
04:59:38.350 --> 04:59:38.360 align:start position:0%
that not being appropriate for the
 
04:59:40.548 --> 04:59:40.558 align:start position:0%
locations and would like to think that
 
04:59:42.270 --> 04:59:42.280 align:start position:0%
maybe the towns could address it but I
 
04:59:44.708 --> 04:59:44.718 align:start position:0%
don't feel that it's clear here and the
 
04:59:47.110 --> 04:59:47.120 align:start position:0%
other issue uh one of the primary ones
 
04:59:50.070 --> 04:59:50.080 align:start position:0%
that I have is down at line 25 to 28 on
 
04:59:52.430 --> 04:59:52.440 align:start position:0%
the third page which talks about the
 
04:59:54.670 --> 04:59:54.680 align:start position:0%
planning boards and it says basically
 
04:59:56.270 --> 04:59:56.280 align:start position:0%
once this is approved the planning
 
04:59:58.548 --> 04:59:58.558 align:start position:0%
boards are required or shall be required
 
05:00:00.230 --> 05:00:00.240 align:start position:0%
to approve the alternative parking
 
05:00:02.708 --> 05:00:02.718 align:start position:0%
solution proposed by the ACT applicant
 
05:00:05.030 --> 05:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
as a substitute for the proposed
 
05:00:08.070 --> 05:00:08.080 align:start position:0%
residential use meeting on-site parking
 
05:00:09.628 --> 05:00:09.638 align:start position:0%
requirements so if the township felt
 
05:00:12.270 --> 05:00:12.280 align:start position:0%
there was a problem with parking they
 
05:00:16.470 --> 05:00:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:19.310 --> 05:00:19.320 align:start position:0%
it thank you further
 
05:00:22.830 --> 05:00:22.840 align:start position:0%
comments representative holl so I I
 
05:00:24.270 --> 05:00:24.280 align:start position:0%
actually like the Bild a couple of
 
05:00:27.708 --> 05:00:27.718 align:start position:0%
things the the 79e component you it
 
05:00:29.150 --> 05:00:29.160 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of flexibil first of all
 
05:00:30.990 --> 05:00:31.000 align:start position:0%
you don't have to adopt it but if you do
 
05:00:32.708 --> 05:00:32.718 align:start position:0%
adopt it you have the flexibility in
 
05:00:35.190 --> 05:00:35.200 align:start position:0%
terms of the length of how you do it um
 
05:00:37.470 --> 05:00:37.480 align:start position:0%
I think one of the concerns that people
 
05:00:40.030 --> 05:00:40.040 align:start position:0%
have used 79e is just be careful how
 
05:00:43.470 --> 05:00:43.480 align:start position:0%
long you give the 79e um the second the
 
05:00:45.788 --> 05:00:45.798 align:start position:0%
thing I like about 79e also is it
 
05:00:47.628 --> 05:00:47.638 align:start position:0%
doesn't require the municipality to come
 
05:00:50.390 --> 05:00:50.400 align:start position:0%
up with an in any money upfront since
 
05:00:52.910 --> 05:00:52.920 align:start position:0%
you're freezing the assessment there's
 
05:00:55.750 --> 05:00:55.760 align:start position:0%
no upfront cost you lose some taxation
 
05:00:57.310 --> 05:00:57.320 align:start position:0%
but you'll gain it the long run because
 
05:00:59.788 --> 05:00:59.798 align:start position:0%
you let a project go through the part I
 
05:01:02.708 --> 05:01:02.718 align:start position:0%
like I was on a Town Council form of
 
05:01:04.830 --> 05:01:04.840 align:start position:0%
government and so in terms of zoning we
 
05:01:06.948 --> 05:01:06.958 align:start position:0%
have a lot of flexibility we can bring
 
05:01:09.910 --> 05:01:09.920 align:start position:0%
forth amendments regularly it works
 
05:01:11.868 --> 05:01:11.878 align:start position:0%
works really really in terms of how that
 
05:01:15.310 --> 05:01:15.320 align:start position:0%
works with the planning board um if a
 
05:01:17.590 --> 05:01:17.600 align:start position:0%
zoning Amendment comes up it goes to the
 
05:01:19.350 --> 05:01:19.360 align:start position:0%
planning board first the planning board
 
05:01:21.230 --> 05:01:21.240 align:start position:0%
works on it and then it'll ultimately
 
05:01:23.430 --> 05:01:23.440 align:start position:0%
come to the Town Council for approval
 
05:01:25.628 --> 05:01:25.638 align:start position:0%
and as I say this just gives a you know
 
05:01:28.030 --> 05:01:28.040 align:start position:0%
for us we take it for granted that it
 
05:01:30.548 --> 05:01:30.558 align:start position:0%
could be October we decide you know this
 
05:01:31.868 --> 05:01:31.878 align:start position:0%
zoning amendment is a really good one
 
05:01:33.868 --> 05:01:33.878 align:start position:0%
let's bring this forward or it just
 
05:01:35.470 --> 05:01:35.480 align:start position:0%
gives you a lot of flexibility so I
 
05:01:37.150 --> 05:01:37.160 align:start position:0%
think that's a really the part of this
 
05:01:42.430 --> 05:01:42.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:44.990 --> 05:01:45.000 align:start position:0%
for the comments representative
 
05:01:49.270 --> 05:01:49.280 align:start position:0%
PRI thank you Mr chairman um I too will
 
05:01:52.990 --> 05:01:53.000 align:start position:0%
be uh voting against the itl and am
 
05:01:57.350 --> 05:01:57.360 align:start position:0%
supporting uh HB 538 for many reasons
 
05:02:00.628 --> 05:02:00.638 align:start position:0%
that my colleague has just noted I does
 
05:02:04.910 --> 05:02:04.920 align:start position:0%
I do think that this gives the uh local
 
05:02:08.868 --> 05:02:08.878 align:start position:0%
governments the some more tools to work
 
05:02:11.948 --> 05:02:11.958 align:start position:0%
with in to providing affordable housing
 
05:02:14.548 --> 05:02:14.558 align:start position:0%
within their jurisdictions and all of
 
05:02:19.190 --> 05:02:19.200 align:start position:0%
the sections of this is it's up to them
 
05:02:24.110 --> 05:02:24.120 align:start position:0%
to enact so we're not forcing them to um
 
05:02:27.830 --> 05:02:27.840 align:start position:0%
to do this uh to use these tools we're
 
05:02:29.628 --> 05:02:29.638 align:start position:0%
just giving them the
 
05:02:33.230 --> 05:02:33.240 align:start position:0%
opportunity of using them if the
 
05:02:36.910 --> 05:02:36.920 align:start position:0%
situation arises and they are in need of
 
05:02:39.910 --> 05:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
affordable housing and I think this is a
 
05:02:43.910 --> 05:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
win-win for everyone thank
 
05:02:48.350 --> 05:02:48.360 align:start position:0%
you further comments representative
 
05:02:51.310 --> 05:02:51.320 align:start position:0%
Brown thank you Mr chairman I guess the
 
05:02:53.070 --> 05:02:53.080 align:start position:0%
other issue that I have with this is
 
05:02:56.390 --> 05:02:56.400 align:start position:0%
that this work can be done uh currently
 
05:02:59.548 --> 05:02:59.558 align:start position:0%
by developers without without this Bill
 
05:03:01.190 --> 05:03:01.200 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
05:03:05.910 --> 05:03:05.920 align:start position:0%
Gallagher um so I'm in support of this
 
05:03:09.868 --> 05:03:09.878 align:start position:0%
bill and against the itl motion um I
 
05:03:11.590 --> 05:03:11.600 align:start position:0%
actually kind of disappointed though
 
05:03:14.030 --> 05:03:14.040 align:start position:0%
about some of the parts of it that came
 
05:03:17.868 --> 05:03:17.878 align:start position:0%
out of it in the Senate um I think it
 
05:03:21.350 --> 05:03:21.360 align:start position:0%
was better previously but um
 
05:03:23.510 --> 05:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
unfortunately had to be kind of watered
 
05:03:27.590 --> 05:03:27.600 align:start position:0%
down a bit to get it past um so it's
 
05:03:29.990 --> 05:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
frustrating hearing people saying that
 
05:03:31.910 --> 05:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
no it actually wasn't watered down
 
05:03:35.628 --> 05:03:35.638 align:start position:0%
enough when it's art already already is
 
05:03:39.510 --> 05:03:39.520 align:start position:0%
basically not almost not going almost
 
05:03:45.070 --> 05:03:45.080 align:start position:0%
not not doing anything um so uh yeah I I
 
05:03:47.430 --> 05:03:47.440 align:start position:0%
I personally would rather parking
 
05:03:50.708 --> 05:03:50.718 align:start position:0%
minimums just be abolished entirely but
 
05:03:54.030 --> 05:03:54.040 align:start position:0%
this bill doesn't do that it just um
 
05:03:57.830 --> 05:03:57.840 align:start position:0%
provides a an additional way to get
 
05:04:04.070 --> 05:04:04.080 align:start position:0%
around them um so I I think given the
 
05:04:06.788 --> 05:04:06.798 align:start position:0%
um amount of compromise that's already
 
05:04:10.990 --> 05:04:11.000 align:start position:0%
been given um that this really ought to
 
05:04:13.788 --> 05:04:13.798 align:start position:0%
be a simple bill that we can come
 
05:04:17.750 --> 05:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
together around to um increase the
 
05:04:21.310 --> 05:04:21.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:24.030 --> 05:04:24.040 align:start position:0%
state further
 
05:04:27.190 --> 05:04:27.200 align:start position:0%
comments representative frct thank you
 
05:04:29.548 --> 05:04:29.558 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
05:04:34.270 --> 05:04:34.280 align:start position:0%
um I think I support 2third of this
 
05:04:36.830 --> 05:04:36.840 align:start position:0%
bill um the
 
05:04:39.270 --> 05:04:39.280 align:start position:0%
parking I think eventually we're going
 
05:04:42.270 --> 05:04:42.280 align:start position:0%
to find that parking requirements are
 
05:04:45.910 --> 05:04:45.920 align:start position:0%
Market driven if a developer doesn't
 
05:04:48.628 --> 05:04:48.638 align:start position:0%
have enough parking spaces for his
 
05:04:52.230 --> 05:04:52.240 align:start position:0%
prospective tenants then he's not going
 
05:04:55.510 --> 05:04:55.520 align:start position:0%
to be able to rent the space and on the
 
05:04:58.350 --> 05:04:58.360 align:start position:0%
other side of it if a tenant doesn't
 
05:05:01.270 --> 05:05:01.280 align:start position:0%
have enough parking spaces for the
 
05:05:04.788 --> 05:05:04.798 align:start position:0%
amount of cars in the household then the
 
05:05:06.830 --> 05:05:06.840 align:start position:0%
um tenant is not going to want to rent
 
05:05:09.708 --> 05:05:09.718 align:start position:0%
in that particular building I think the
 
05:05:13.628 --> 05:05:13.638 align:start position:0%
tax credit idea is good I'm in favor of
 
05:05:18.868 --> 05:05:18.878 align:start position:0%
that I am hesitant on the idea of
 
05:05:22.670 --> 05:05:22.680 align:start position:0%
transferring the um the adoption of
 
05:05:24.628 --> 05:05:24.638 align:start position:0%
zoning rags
 
05:05:29.590 --> 05:05:29.600 align:start position:0%
to the select board rather than to town
 
05:05:31.868 --> 05:05:31.878 align:start position:0%
meeting um my
 
05:05:35.390 --> 05:05:35.400 align:start position:0%
reservations are that it could lead to
 
05:05:39.990 --> 05:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
what I call kneejerk or reactive zoning
 
05:05:43.430 --> 05:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
um zoning I think is very important for
 
05:05:46.430 --> 05:05:46.440 align:start position:0%
the way a town functions for the way it
 
05:05:49.948 --> 05:05:49.958 align:start position:0%
looks and I think it should
 
05:05:53.590 --> 05:05:53.600 align:start position:0%
be well thought out and I think it
 
05:05:57.190 --> 05:05:57.200 align:start position:0%
should be voted on by the majority of
 
05:06:01.990 --> 05:06:02.000 align:start position:0%
the voters not by a select Board of
 
05:06:05.990 --> 05:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
three or five people thank you Mr
 
05:06:09.030 --> 05:06:09.040 align:start position:0%
chair forther comments I will be
 
05:06:11.628 --> 05:06:11.638 align:start position:0%
supporting the bill
 
05:06:16.070 --> 05:06:16.080 align:start position:0%
though very good forther
 
05:06:18.868 --> 05:06:18.878 align:start position:0%
comments seeing N I have a few today on
 
05:06:18.878 --> 05:06:20.830 align:start position:0%
comments seeing N I have a few today on
this

05:06:20.830 --> 05:06:20.840 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:06:23.788 --> 05:06:23.798 align:start position:0%
bill um since representative Frack
 
05:06:26.750 --> 05:06:26.760 align:start position:0%
brought it up I would mention that I am
 
05:06:29.948 --> 05:06:29.958 align:start position:0%
in total agreement with his his uh
 
05:06:32.390 --> 05:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
comments regarding the local governing
 
05:06:35.310 --> 05:06:35.320 align:start position:0%
body uh where the change the alternate
 
05:06:36.948 --> 05:06:36.958 align:start position:0%
procedure for adoption of zoning
 
05:06:38.590 --> 05:06:38.600 align:start position:0%
ordinances I think that's a horrible
 
05:06:41.150 --> 05:06:41.160 align:start position:0%
idea I think the the local government
 
05:06:41.160 --> 05:06:43.230 align:start position:0%
idea I think the the local government
body

05:06:43.230 --> 05:06:43.240 align:start position:0%
body
 
05:06:46.628 --> 05:06:46.638 align:start position:0%
um making being authorized to adopt
 
05:06:48.110 --> 05:06:48.120 align:start position:0%
amendments without going through the
 
05:06:51.390 --> 05:06:51.400 align:start position:0%
usual warrant article is an extremely uh
 
05:06:51.400 --> 05:06:55.430 align:start position:0%
usual warrant article is an extremely uh
bad

05:06:55.430 --> 05:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:58.548 --> 05:06:58.558 align:start position:0%
idea the new section on page one of
 
05:07:01.110 --> 05:07:01.120 align:start position:0%
community revitalization tax relief
 
05:07:04.070 --> 05:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
that's another idea that I think is um
 
05:07:08.150 --> 05:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
not good um I think what can happen in
 
05:07:10.070 --> 05:07:10.080 align:start position:0%
these situations and that again this is
 
05:07:12.190 --> 05:07:12.200 align:start position:0%
a new section there I know I realize
 
05:07:14.390 --> 05:07:14.400 align:start position:0%
some of these type of tax reliefs
 
05:07:16.350 --> 05:07:16.360 align:start position:0%
already exist but anytime you do a tax
 
05:07:20.110 --> 05:07:20.120 align:start position:0%
relief uh for one individual it's the
 
05:07:22.230 --> 05:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
burden falls on somebody else and in
 
05:07:24.548 --> 05:07:24.558 align:start position:0%
this case it's going to be the remaining
 
05:07:29.430 --> 05:07:29.440 align:start position:0%
taxpayers um I I am always opposed
 
05:07:34.110 --> 05:07:34.120 align:start position:0%
to special interest um
 
05:07:36.670 --> 05:07:36.680 align:start position:0%
getting spe special
 
05:07:40.788 --> 05:07:40.798 align:start position:0%
treatment and the rest of the tax payers
 
05:07:48.150 --> 05:07:48.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:53.030 --> 05:07:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:57.070 --> 05:07:57.080 align:start position:0%
section is the parking um this section
 
05:08:02.350 --> 05:08:02.360 align:start position:0%
is fraught with uh real real problems uh
 
05:08:04.310 --> 05:08:04.320 align:start position:0%
written poorly and I'm going to go
 
05:08:06.708 --> 05:08:06.718 align:start position:0%
through and explain why this is wrong
 
05:08:08.990 --> 05:08:09.000 align:start position:0%
alternative parking solution when you go
 
05:08:11.830 --> 05:08:11.840 align:start position:0%
through and read it it says that the
 
05:08:14.150 --> 05:08:14.160 align:start position:0%
parking solution shall include and then
 
05:08:16.628 --> 05:08:16.638 align:start position:0%
there's items number one item number two
 
05:08:18.910 --> 05:08:18.920 align:start position:0%
item number three and number
 
05:08:21.310 --> 05:08:21.320 align:start position:0%
four the problem
 
05:08:25.510 --> 05:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
is that if you look at on line 14 about
 
05:08:28.510 --> 05:08:28.520 align:start position:0%
3/4 of the way across is the word
 
05:08:32.868 --> 05:08:32.878 align:start position:0%
or and what that means is and uh
 
05:08:34.708 --> 05:08:34.718 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher was saying he
 
05:08:37.708 --> 05:08:37.718 align:start position:0%
wish that no parking was required that
 
05:08:41.270 --> 05:08:41.280 align:start position:0%
word there intent or
 
05:08:45.070 --> 05:08:45.080 align:start position:0%
not means that an alternative parking
 
05:08:47.948 --> 05:08:47.958 align:start position:0%
solution could an items two three or
 
05:08:51.670 --> 05:08:51.680 align:start position:0%
four require absolutely no parking
 
05:08:53.310 --> 05:08:53.320 align:start position:0%
requirements now whether that's
 
05:08:55.990 --> 05:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
intentional or not
 
05:08:59.910 --> 05:08:59.920 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure but that is a
 
05:09:04.270 --> 05:09:04.280 align:start position:0%
horrible horrible um
 
05:09:08.190 --> 05:09:08.200 align:start position:0%
Clause the next thing uh was what
 
05:09:10.110 --> 05:09:10.120 align:start position:0%
represent majori brought up earlier in
 
05:09:13.110 --> 05:09:13.120 align:start position:0%
the day during the
 
05:09:16.750 --> 05:09:16.760 align:start position:0%
testimony when you go down to line 19
 
05:09:18.948 --> 05:09:18.958 align:start position:0%
and we talk
 
05:09:22.750 --> 05:09:22.760 align:start position:0%
about or not line 19 the item Roman
 
05:09:25.510 --> 05:09:25.520 align:start position:0%
numeral 2 that starts on 23 the parking
 
05:09:28.350 --> 05:09:28.360 align:start position:0%
solution the planning board shall be
 
05:09:30.510 --> 05:09:30.520 align:start position:0%
required to consider all right well that
 
05:09:32.830 --> 05:09:32.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't sound bad you got to consider
 
05:09:35.670 --> 05:09:35.680 align:start position:0%
it then it goes on the next Roman
 
05:09:38.110 --> 05:09:38.120 align:start position:0%
numeral it says the applicant can
 
05:09:41.470 --> 05:09:41.480 align:start position:0%
demonstrate and 26 it says a planning
 
05:09:44.590 --> 05:09:44.600 align:start position:0%
board shall be required to approve an
 
05:09:46.750 --> 05:09:46.760 align:start position:0%
alternative parking solution proposed by
 
05:09:46.760 --> 05:09:47.788 align:start position:0%
alternative parking solution proposed by
the

05:09:47.788 --> 05:09:47.798 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:09:50.948 --> 05:09:50.958 align:start position:0%
applicant so in one sentence it's saying
 
05:09:52.470 --> 05:09:52.480 align:start position:0%
well you should consider in the very
 
05:09:55.030 --> 05:09:55.040 align:start position:0%
next sentence or paragraph it says the
 
05:09:57.590 --> 05:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
planning board shall be
 
05:10:00.750 --> 05:10:00.760 align:start position:0%
required and if the planning board does
 
05:10:00.760 --> 05:10:02.990 align:start position:0%
required and if the planning board does
not

05:10:02.990 --> 05:10:03.000 align:start position:0%
not
 
05:10:06.750 --> 05:10:06.760 align:start position:0%
approve as required by line 26 it says
 
05:10:09.390 --> 05:10:09.400 align:start position:0%
the planning board can request 30 thir
 
05:10:12.430 --> 05:10:12.440 align:start position:0%
party review that's exactly 180 de out
 
05:10:16.868 --> 05:10:16.878 align:start position:0%
from any other uh uh type of planning
 
05:10:18.948 --> 05:10:18.958 align:start position:0%
board it's usually if the planning board
 
05:10:20.670 --> 05:10:20.680 align:start position:0%
turns it down then it's up to the
 
05:10:23.948 --> 05:10:23.958 align:start position:0%
applicant to request thirdparty review
 
05:10:27.830 --> 05:10:27.840 align:start position:0%
this is this is 180 degrees of where it
 
05:10:27.840 --> 05:10:35.310 align:start position:0%
this is this is 180 degrees of where it
should

05:10:35.310 --> 05:10:35.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:40.030 --> 05:10:40.040 align:start position:0%
be as uh others have uh mentioned that
 
05:10:43.310 --> 05:10:43.320 align:start position:0%
most everything here can already be done
 
05:10:44.948 --> 05:10:44.958 align:start position:0%
which is very typical with a lot of
 
05:10:47.708 --> 05:10:47.718 align:start position:0%
these bills
 
05:10:50.430 --> 05:10:50.440 align:start position:0%
zoning these can already be done by the
 
05:10:53.750 --> 05:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
the the towns if they want to uh the
 
05:10:59.190 --> 05:10:59.200 align:start position:0%
other last item I will talk about is um
 
05:11:01.788 --> 05:11:01.798 align:start position:0%
transparency and one of the issues when
 
05:11:05.190 --> 05:11:05.200 align:start position:0%
you start giving the planning board or
 
05:11:08.548 --> 05:11:08.558 align:start position:0%
whatever legislative body the ability to
 
05:11:10.390 --> 05:11:10.400 align:start position:0%
Grant tax tax
 
05:11:14.070 --> 05:11:14.080 align:start position:0%
relief or even in one of the sections
 
05:11:16.230 --> 05:11:16.240 align:start position:0%
there where it talks about zoning being
 
05:11:21.270 --> 05:11:21.280 align:start position:0%
able being given to the uh local body to
 
05:11:23.430 --> 05:11:23.440 align:start position:0%
to do rather than through warrant
 
05:11:25.628 --> 05:11:25.638 align:start position:0%
articles and that is you open it up to
 
05:11:28.510 --> 05:11:28.520 align:start position:0%
what I would call favoritism Andor
 
05:11:32.470 --> 05:11:32.480 align:start position:0%
special interest or even uh a little bit
 
05:11:35.990 --> 05:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
of swamp so for all those reasons I I'm
 
05:11:37.788 --> 05:11:37.798 align:start position:0%
in favor of the
 
05:11:41.470 --> 05:11:41.480 align:start position:0%
itl and and that's it further comments
 
05:11:41.480 --> 05:11:44.070 align:start position:0%
itl and and that's it further comments
or

05:11:44.070 --> 05:11:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:48.230 --> 05:11:48.240 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none bless the get on
 
05:11:50.110 --> 05:11:50.120 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry oh yes go ahead I just wanted
 
05:11:53.430 --> 05:11:53.440 align:start position:0%

05:11:55.510 --> 05:11:55.520 align:start position:0%
bill came to this committee and and I

so-called housing bills are vetted to
 
05:12:03.680 --> 05:12:04.788 align:start position:0%
so-called housing bills are vetted to
this

05:12:04.788 --> 05:12:04.798 align:start position:0%

all the bills housing bills especially
 
05:12:30.750 --> 05:12:30.760 align:start position:0%
when they're sponsored by the housing
 
05:12:33.430 --> 05:12:33.440 align:start position:0%

stavis thank you Mr chair and if I may
 
05:12:49.590 --> 05:12:49.600 align:start position:0%
add that if those housing bills are
 
05:12:51.990 --> 05:12:52.000 align:start position:0%

05:12:54.628 --> 05:12:54.638 align:start position:0%
by the housing committee and voted on by
 
05:12:56.910 --> 05:12:56.920 align:start position:0%
the housing committee and put on the
 
05:12:59.270 --> 05:12:59.280 align:start position:0%
consent calendar then this body has no
 
05:13:02.150 --> 05:13:02.160 align:start position:0%
opportunity to debate them on the
 
05:13:05.510 --> 05:13:05.520 align:start position:0%
floor for the comments uh representative
 
05:13:08.708 --> 05:13:08.718 align:start position:0%
K thank you Mr chair yeah I wanted to
 
05:13:11.670 --> 05:13:11.680 align:start position:0%
Echo my my sentiment on this I I firmly
 
05:13:13.510 --> 05:13:13.520 align:start position:0%
agreed with your comments on the house
 
05:13:16.548 --> 05:13:16.558 align:start position:0%
floor and support that the housing bill
 
05:13:20.750 --> 05:13:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:24.350 --> 05:13:24.360 align:start position:0%
committee representative Gallagher um I
 
05:13:28.390 --> 05:13:28.400 align:start position:0%
disagree strongly um I think that or I
 
05:13:32.670 --> 05:13:32.680 align:start position:0%
originally chose to um s chose to
 
05:13:34.310 --> 05:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
request to be on this committee when I
 
05:13:36.230 --> 05:13:36.240 align:start position:0%
first joined because I thought we would
 
05:13:39.110 --> 05:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
be it would be the opportunity to be
 
05:13:40.708 --> 05:13:40.718 align:start position:0%
passing good housing legislation but
 
05:13:42.390 --> 05:13:42.400 align:start position:0%
unfortunately that's not what happens
 
05:13:43.830 --> 05:13:43.840 align:start position:0%
here unfortunately this is where good
 
05:13:46.350 --> 05:13:46.360 align:start position:0%
housing legislation tends to go to die
 
05:13:47.948 --> 05:13:47.958 align:start position:0%
which is why the special committee on
 
05:13:50.230 --> 05:13:50.240 align:start position:0%
housing needed to be created in the
 
05:13:54.350 --> 05:13:54.360 align:start position:0%
first place if you don't want bills to
 
05:13:55.948 --> 05:13:55.958 align:start position:0%
be going to the special committee on
 
05:13:58.030 --> 05:13:58.040 align:start position:0%
housing instead you could try actually
 
05:14:00.510 --> 05:14:00.520 align:start position:0%
passing some through here instead of
 
05:14:03.110 --> 05:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
just acting as obstructionists the whole
 
05:14:05.910 --> 05:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
time so that workarounds for us are
 
05:14:11.430 --> 05:14:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:14.948 --> 05:14:14.958 align:start position:0%
representative power Mr chairman I'm I'm
 
05:14:18.030 --> 05:14:18.040 align:start position:0%
really confused as to how the discussion
 
05:14:22.628 --> 05:14:22.638 align:start position:0%
on the the content or merits of a bill
 
05:14:24.590 --> 05:14:24.600 align:start position:0%
devolved into
 
05:14:26.990 --> 05:14:27.000 align:start position:0%
bashing um committee assignments for
 
05:14:29.510 --> 05:14:29.520 align:start position:0%
bills and to be clear the speaker and
 
05:14:31.868 --> 05:14:31.878 align:start position:0%
the house clerk assigns the bills and
 
05:14:36.030 --> 05:14:36.040 align:start position:0%

05:18:35.430 --> 05:18:35.440 align:start position:0%

need to settle this issue on a local
level

05:18:40.750 --> 05:18:40.760 align:start position:0%

priest I think it's very important that
 
05:18:54.750 --> 05:18:54.760 align:start position:0%
we wait until the uh Supreme Court uh
 
05:18:59.670 --> 05:18:59.680 align:start position:0%
rules on this present Bill and then see
 
05:19:02.510 --> 05:19:02.520 align:start position:0%
what happens and then go from there but
 
05:19:04.948 --> 05:19:04.958 align:start position:0%
also I would agree with uh
 
05:19:06.510 --> 05:19:06.520 align:start position:0%
representative kahill we shouldn't be
 
05:19:09.030 --> 05:19:09.040 align:start position:0%
getting involved this is something that
 
05:19:13.510 --> 05:19:13.520 align:start position:0%
that um uh the towns and The Villages
 
05:19:15.628 --> 05:19:15.638 align:start position:0%
should have been working on and have
 
05:19:18.030 --> 05:19:18.040 align:start position:0%
been working on in the past and then we
 
05:19:19.750 --> 05:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
should not hinder their progress in
 
05:19:22.830 --> 05:19:22.840 align:start position:0%
trying to consolidate these Services
 
05:19:24.990 --> 05:19:25.000 align:start position:0%

resolution that seems to be where this
 
05:19:45.990 --> 05:19:46.000 align:start position:0%
dispute is right at the moment and I
 
05:19:48.150 --> 05:19:48.160 align:start position:0%
think it should stay there and
 
05:19:51.430 --> 05:19:51.440 align:start position:0%
legislation is not required at this time
 
05:19:51.440 --> 05:19:52.270 align:start position:0%
