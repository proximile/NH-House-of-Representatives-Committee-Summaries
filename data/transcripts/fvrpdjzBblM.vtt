00:21:58.070 --> 00:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
so you know the reason for the delay is
 
00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:00.840 align:start position:0%
we um we there were there was some
 
00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
paperwork glitch in the uh
 
00:22:06.830 --> 00:22:06.840 align:start position:0%
in the paperwork that the clerk needs to
 
00:22:09.289 --> 00:22:09.299 align:start position:0%
have for votes so we're we're waiting to
 
00:22:11.029 --> 00:22:11.039 align:start position:0%
clear that up so we have the proper
 
00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
names in the of the people on this
 
00:22:15.049 --> 00:22:15.059 align:start position:0%
committee and then we'll be able to get
 
00:22:15.059 --> 00:22:16.130 align:start position:0%
committee and then we'll be able to get
started

00:22:16.130 --> 00:22:16.140 align:start position:0%
started
 
00:22:29.149 --> 00:22:29.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:31.970 --> 00:22:31.980 align:start position:0%
all right um I'm going to call the uh
 
00:22:34.549 --> 00:22:34.559 align:start position:0%
executive session of the house Judiciary
 
00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:37.200 align:start position:0%
Committee uh to order and I'd first uh
 
00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:39.000 align:start position:0%
recognize representative G Lorenzo to
 
00:22:44.510 --> 00:22:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:57.950 align:start position:0%
 
congratulations

00:22:57.950 --> 00:22:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:01.909 --> 00:23:01.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:01.919 --> 00:23:02.750 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:23:02.750 --> 00:23:02.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:04.610 --> 00:23:04.620 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:05.570 align:start position:0%
all right so
um

00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:05.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:09.250 --> 00:23:09.260 align:start position:0%
I think what we'll uh what will take up
 
00:23:13.490 --> 00:23:13.500 align:start position:0%
uh first is the um
 
00:23:17.029 --> 00:23:17.039 align:start position:0%
is the bill on which uh
 
00:23:20.330 --> 00:23:20.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:23.930 --> 00:23:23.940 align:start position:0%
uh we we uh had a sort of ad hoc group
 
00:23:26.510 --> 00:23:26.520 align:start position:0%
that that worked in more detail uh since
 
00:23:28.669 --> 00:23:28.679 align:start position:0%
our last executive uh committee meeting
 
00:23:33.770 --> 00:23:33.780 align:start position:0%
on Monday on HB 169 and so I recognize
 
00:23:37.970 --> 00:23:37.980 align:start position:0%
uh representative cutoff please
 
00:23:42.169 --> 00:23:42.179 align:start position:0%
I make a motion to itl 169.
 
00:23:43.730 --> 00:23:43.740 align:start position:0%
is there a second
 
00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:45.900 align:start position:0%
I seconded all right representative
 
00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:48.120 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative Manos and uh
 
00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
representative would you like to speak
 
00:23:51.890 --> 00:23:51.900 align:start position:0%
to the motion
 
00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:54.120 align:start position:0%
yes so this was a very difficult bill
 
00:23:57.049 --> 00:23:57.059 align:start position:0%
for us we did meet
 
00:23:59.090 --> 00:23:59.100 align:start position:0%
for a pretty good amount of time we we
 
00:24:01.490 --> 00:24:01.500 align:start position:0%
all read through a pretty extensive
 
00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
amount of cases
 
00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:06.240 align:start position:0%
several of them which uh chairman you
 
00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:07.980 align:start position:0%
had actually concurred on in your time
 
00:24:11.210 --> 00:24:11.220 align:start position:0%
on the on the Supreme Court and
 
00:24:14.690 --> 00:24:14.700 align:start position:0%
it just as much as as we feel for for
 
00:24:16.850 --> 00:24:16.860 align:start position:0%
the family that we heard from we have a
 
00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:18.600 align:start position:0%
concern that that this bill has the
 
00:24:20.149 --> 00:24:20.159 align:start position:0%
potential to do more harm than good
 
00:24:20.159 --> 00:24:22.010 align:start position:0%
potential to do more harm than good
because

00:24:22.010 --> 00:24:22.020 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:23.880 align:start position:0%
it seems like it's ripe for Challenge
 
00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:25.789 align:start position:0%
it seems like it's ripe for Challenge
and

00:24:25.789 --> 00:24:25.799 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:24:27.770 --> 00:24:27.780 align:start position:0%
um it may not necessarily have even
 
00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
helped in this case because we're not
 
00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:31.440 align:start position:0%
defining kind of what that level of
 
00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
evidence is and it is
 
00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:36.360 align:start position:0%
somebody's judgment and everybody's
 
00:24:38.330 --> 00:24:38.340 align:start position:0%
human and sometimes
 
00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:40.320 align:start position:0%
the way that we decide things is
 
00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
different than how somebody else would
 
00:24:44.149 --> 00:24:44.159 align:start position:0%
decide and
 
00:24:44.159 --> 00:24:44.990 align:start position:0%
decide and
um

00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:45.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:47.149 --> 00:24:47.159 align:start position:0%
we do plan to look further to see if
 
00:24:48.409 --> 00:24:48.419 align:start position:0%
perhaps there's something that we could
 
00:24:51.169 --> 00:24:51.179 align:start position:0%
enter for next year that may make more
 
00:24:51.179 --> 00:24:52.549 align:start position:0%
enter for next year that may make more
sense

00:24:52.549 --> 00:24:52.559 align:start position:0%
sense
 
00:24:54.710 --> 00:24:54.720 align:start position:0%
but unfortunately it just seemed as
 
00:24:57.110 --> 00:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
though it due to the constitutional
 
00:24:59.510 --> 00:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
right that the parents have and and the
 
00:25:01.250 --> 00:25:01.260 align:start position:0%
fact that this is a consensual
 
00:25:05.330 --> 00:25:05.340 align:start position:0%
Guardianship and that it wasn't ordered
 
00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:09.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:11.409 --> 00:25:11.419 align:start position:0%
that unfortunately
 
00:25:14.210 --> 00:25:14.220 align:start position:0%
requiring more than a preponderance of
 
00:25:16.730 --> 00:25:16.740 align:start position:0%
evidence doesn't seem like it would
 
00:25:18.529 --> 00:25:18.539 align:start position:0%
stand the test
 
00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:21.360 align:start position:0%
so we again we did review everything and
 
00:25:24.470 --> 00:25:24.480 align:start position:0%
we didn't take this decision lightly
 
00:25:27.769 --> 00:25:27.779 align:start position:0%
and it's unfortunate but it seemed it
 
00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:30.720 align:start position:0%
was best to itl the bill
 
00:25:34.010 --> 00:25:34.020 align:start position:0%
any other comments uh yes representative
 
00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:36.950 align:start position:0%
any other comments uh yes representative
Perez

00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:38.100 align:start position:0%
I think
 
00:25:40.490 --> 00:25:40.500 align:start position:0%
fact that you're concerned about whether
 
00:25:44.930 --> 00:25:44.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:46.970 --> 00:25:46.980 align:start position:0%
personally do not feel that that's a
 
00:25:50.029 --> 00:25:50.039 align:start position:0%
reason to itl this bill my biggest
 
00:25:53.029 --> 00:25:53.039 align:start position:0%
concern with this is that
 
00:25:55.730 --> 00:25:55.740 align:start position:0%
um the child is not being represented
 
00:25:55.740 --> 00:25:57.230 align:start position:0%
um the child is not being represented
and

00:25:57.230 --> 00:25:57.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:25:59.750 --> 00:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
if a child whether it's with agreement
 
00:26:02.029 --> 00:26:02.039 align:start position:0%
or not with agreement there was a
 
00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
problem with this family they were drug
 
00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:07.440 align:start position:0%
addicts and they agreed to have the
 
00:26:10.549 --> 00:26:10.559 align:start position:0%
child taken by the grandparent
 
00:26:13.370 --> 00:26:13.380 align:start position:0%
if a child is put in
 
00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
um it but and then they
 
00:26:18.590 --> 00:26:18.600 align:start position:0%
they would give them back to the parents
 
00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:21.720 align:start position:0%
and now they're in foster care I think
 
00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
this happens more
 
00:26:26.510 --> 00:26:26.520 align:start position:0%
then we realize it happens and my
 
00:26:28.970 --> 00:26:28.980 align:start position:0%
concern about this is that the child is
 
00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
not being represented and
 
00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:36.480 align:start position:0%
being a having a drug abuse problem
 
00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
is a is an illness and the illness
 
00:26:42.289 --> 00:26:42.299 align:start position:0%
doesn't go away because
 
00:26:44.450 --> 00:26:44.460 align:start position:0%
you're always a drug addict you're
 
00:26:46.549 --> 00:26:46.559 align:start position:0%
always an alcoholic you always have the
 
00:26:49.430 --> 00:26:49.440 align:start position:0%
potential I think that parents in order
 
00:26:52.549 --> 00:26:52.559 align:start position:0%
it's hard to take parents away
 
00:26:56.330 --> 00:26:56.340 align:start position:0%
it should be hard to allow a child back
 
00:26:58.909 --> 00:26:58.919 align:start position:0%
into a home I just am very uncomfortable
 
00:27:01.549 --> 00:27:01.559 align:start position:0%
with it I had thought about
 
00:27:06.350 --> 00:27:06.360 align:start position:0%
um perhaps just having it studied longer
 
00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
but I just it has to be more than it has
 
00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:13.200 align:start position:0%
to be more than 51 percent that these
 
00:27:15.409 --> 00:27:15.419 align:start position:0%
children go back I know of many many
 
00:27:19.730 --> 00:27:19.740 align:start position:0%
many cases we just had two huge
 
00:27:22.010 --> 00:27:22.020 align:start position:0%
public things here in New Hampshire that
 
00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:25.320 align:start position:0%
went Nationwide Nationwide about
 
00:27:30.049 --> 00:27:30.059 align:start position:0%
children that were lost in the system
 
00:27:32.269 --> 00:27:32.279 align:start position:0%
who's speaking for the children here I'd
 
00:27:34.250 --> 00:27:34.260 align:start position:0%
like to speak for the children I would
 
00:27:36.409 --> 00:27:36.419 align:start position:0%
like to see if you lose your child
 
00:27:40.130 --> 00:27:40.140 align:start position:0%
because of something abuse or
 
00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
drug addiction or alcoholism or whatever
 
00:27:46.130 --> 00:27:46.140 align:start position:0%
then you have to fight you have to prove
 
00:27:49.010 --> 00:27:49.020 align:start position:0%
more than okay I went to rehab to get
 
00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:50.640 align:start position:0%
that child back
 
00:27:52.010 --> 00:27:52.020 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:27:55.610 --> 00:27:55.620 align:start position:0%
yes representative kuta
 
00:27:58.669 --> 00:27:58.679 align:start position:0%
I completely agree with much of what you
 
00:28:00.350 --> 00:28:00.360 align:start position:0%
just said I think part of the concern
 
00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:02.760 align:start position:0%
was that even if the judge had let's say
 
00:28:04.789 --> 00:28:04.799 align:start position:0%
used a level of preponderance of
 
00:28:08.450 --> 00:28:08.460 align:start position:0%
evidence and not given back a child to
 
00:28:10.789 --> 00:28:10.799 align:start position:0%
the parents that this may give them
 
00:28:14.090 --> 00:28:14.100 align:start position:0%
reason to challenge and say well
 
00:28:16.730 --> 00:28:16.740 align:start position:0%
the law is clear and convincing and even
 
00:28:19.130 --> 00:28:19.140 align:start position:0%
though you maybe only use preponderance
 
00:28:20.510 --> 00:28:20.520 align:start position:0%
they're going to say your level of
 
00:28:22.370 --> 00:28:22.380 align:start position:0%
evidence was too high and that's why you
 
00:28:24.830 --> 00:28:24.840 align:start position:0%
didn't give the child back and so that's
 
00:28:27.230 --> 00:28:27.240 align:start position:0%
where it has the potential to do more
 
00:28:30.769 --> 00:28:30.779 align:start position:0%
harm in in that somebody who was
 
00:28:32.810 --> 00:28:32.820 align:start position:0%
rightfully kept from getting their child
 
00:28:35.690 --> 00:28:35.700 align:start position:0%
back may be able to appeal on the basis
 
00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:38.640 align:start position:0%
of believing that the level of evidence
 
00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:41.580 align:start position:0%
required had been too high
 
00:28:43.610 --> 00:28:43.620 align:start position:0%
and that's where
 
00:28:48.430 --> 00:28:48.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:51.289 --> 00:28:51.299 align:start position:0%
sure representative Perez and I
 
00:28:53.690 --> 00:28:53.700 align:start position:0%
understand that and I I understand where
 
00:28:55.370 --> 00:28:55.380 align:start position:0%
you're coming from but if you have to
 
00:28:57.409 --> 00:28:57.419 align:start position:0%
work harder to get your child back
 
00:28:57.419 --> 00:28:59.330 align:start position:0%
work harder to get your child back
because

00:28:59.330 --> 00:28:59.340 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:29:01.789 --> 00:29:01.799 align:start position:0%
it's all based on
 
00:29:04.549 --> 00:29:04.559 align:start position:0%
you know someone making that decision if
 
00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:06.240 align:start position:0%
you have to work harder to get your
 
00:29:09.110 --> 00:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
child back because it's not overwhelming
 
00:29:11.090 --> 00:29:11.100 align:start position:0%
that you're due to then work harder
 
00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
rather than have that child be given
 
00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
back to you and then turn around and
 
00:29:18.649 --> 00:29:18.659 align:start position:0%
have the child suffer these two national
 
00:29:21.649 --> 00:29:21.659 align:start position:0%
cases that were here these children were
 
00:29:25.990 --> 00:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
given back to parents two children dead
 
00:29:28.490 --> 00:29:28.500 align:start position:0%
representative Manos
 
00:29:31.850 --> 00:29:31.860 align:start position:0%
I was part of the smaller group and two
 
00:29:34.549 --> 00:29:34.559 align:start position:0%
of the cases we looked at are Troxel
 
00:29:38.930 --> 00:29:38.940 align:start position:0%
which is a U.S Supreme Court case and uh
 
00:29:42.649 --> 00:29:42.659 align:start position:0%
Rina D which is a New Hampshire Supreme
 
00:29:45.889 --> 00:29:45.899 align:start position:0%
Court case and I think they're
 
00:29:48.769 --> 00:29:48.779 align:start position:0%
controlling precedence and I think
 
00:29:50.389 --> 00:29:50.399 align:start position:0%
that's why we
 
00:29:50.399 --> 00:29:51.110 align:start position:0%
that's why we
um

00:29:51.110 --> 00:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:54.409 --> 00:29:54.419 align:start position:0%
made the recommendation that we look to
 
00:29:57.350 --> 00:29:57.360 align:start position:0%
the Future to reconsider these issues
 
00:29:59.930 --> 00:29:59.940 align:start position:0%
and that if we went beyond the amendment
 
00:30:03.350 --> 00:30:03.360 align:start position:0%
that that was proposed we would be
 
00:30:05.750 --> 00:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
um that it would be non-germaine and so
 
00:30:07.610 --> 00:30:07.620 align:start position:0%
that was why we made the recommendation
 
00:30:09.529 --> 00:30:09.539 align:start position:0%
to itl
 
00:30:13.130 --> 00:30:13.140 align:start position:0%
all right anyone else want to speak on
 
00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
on this side yes representative Andrews
 
00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman my thing is
 
00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:24.480 align:start position:0%
on this
 
00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:25.690 align:start position:0%
on this
does

00:30:25.690 --> 00:30:25.700 align:start position:0%
does
 
00:30:29.690 --> 00:30:29.700 align:start position:0%
DHHS need to tighten their rules and
 
00:30:32.570 --> 00:30:32.580 align:start position:0%
regulations and do a better job and
 
00:30:35.450 --> 00:30:35.460 align:start position:0%
that's where the problem lies thank you
 
00:30:37.909 --> 00:30:37.919 align:start position:0%
any other yes representative greeson
 
00:30:41.269 --> 00:30:41.279 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh the two court
 
00:30:45.409 --> 00:30:45.419 align:start position:0%
cases Troxel and Rina d uh the dates of
 
00:30:45.419 --> 00:30:46.250 align:start position:0%
cases Troxel and Rina d uh the dates of
them

00:30:46.250 --> 00:30:46.260 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:30:49.370 --> 00:30:49.380 align:start position:0%
are 2010 2011 something along those
 
00:30:52.669 --> 00:30:52.679 align:start position:0%
lines and it appears that current RSA
 
00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:54.720 align:start position:0%
has been modified since then and I've
 
00:30:56.990 --> 00:30:57.000 align:start position:0%
not been able to determine what
 
00:30:59.750 --> 00:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
modifications those exactly were but
 
00:31:03.590 --> 00:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
perhaps because of the language of the
 
00:31:06.350 --> 00:31:06.360 align:start position:0%
of the current law it appears like the
 
00:31:09.289 --> 00:31:09.299 align:start position:0%
modification to have the grandparents in
 
00:31:12.830 --> 00:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
a where the guardianship was by consent
 
00:31:14.570 --> 00:31:14.580 align:start position:0%
and the and what we are looking at
 
00:31:16.850 --> 00:31:16.860 align:start position:0%
potentially potentially modifying again
 
00:31:19.190 --> 00:31:19.200 align:start position:0%
looks like the modification came after
 
00:31:21.169 --> 00:31:21.179 align:start position:0%
those cases in response to the cases and
 
00:31:23.210 --> 00:31:23.220 align:start position:0%
if that's true and I and I would I think
 
00:31:25.250 --> 00:31:25.260 align:start position:0%
we should verify that but if that is
 
00:31:28.549 --> 00:31:28.559 align:start position:0%
true then that's that's after and it has
 
00:31:31.850 --> 00:31:31.860 align:start position:0%
sustained 10 years of of jurisp of
 
00:31:34.490 --> 00:31:34.500 align:start position:0%
jurisprudence and so I I don't see how
 
00:31:37.250 --> 00:31:37.260 align:start position:0%
Troxel and Rina D would then interfere
 
00:31:39.710 --> 00:31:39.720 align:start position:0%
with the ability to modify it again and
 
00:31:42.850 --> 00:31:42.860 align:start position:0%
so if someone I I think that
 
00:31:46.250 --> 00:31:46.260 align:start position:0%
uh I have to agree I don't want to itl
 
00:31:48.110 --> 00:31:48.120 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:49.610 align:start position:0%
this bill
um

00:31:49.610 --> 00:31:49.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:52.010 --> 00:31:52.020 align:start position:0%
because I think that that we if we can
 
00:31:54.110 --> 00:31:54.120 align:start position:0%
at least find out if we can when these
 
00:31:55.850 --> 00:31:55.860 align:start position:0%
modifications were made we can modify it
 
00:31:55.860 --> 00:31:57.110 align:start position:0%
modifications were made we can modify it
again

00:31:57.110 --> 00:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:32:00.409 --> 00:32:00.419 align:start position:0%
so so well yeah yes go ahead please
 
00:32:02.810 --> 00:32:02.820 align:start position:0%
representative so we were able to follow
 
00:32:05.210 --> 00:32:05.220 align:start position:0%
I was able to find the case that the
 
00:32:06.769 --> 00:32:06.779 align:start position:0%
legislation actually came from it was
 
00:32:08.930 --> 00:32:08.940 align:start position:0%
the case of Matthew P they recommend
 
00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:10.970 align:start position:0%
the case of Matthew P they recommend
they

00:32:10.970 --> 00:32:10.980 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
that and you may remember this better
 
00:32:14.870 --> 00:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
than me chairman it was recommended that
 
00:32:17.029 --> 00:32:17.039 align:start position:0%
legislation legislator take a look at
 
00:32:19.010 --> 00:32:19.020 align:start position:0%
this to make a change from the Matthew P
 
00:32:21.409 --> 00:32:21.419 align:start position:0%
case and that's where this legislation
 
00:32:23.029 --> 00:32:23.039 align:start position:0%
did come from
 
00:32:25.370 --> 00:32:25.380 align:start position:0%
in my looking it seemed like the better
 
00:32:28.490 --> 00:32:28.500 align:start position:0%
place to make the change had to do with
 
00:32:31.690 --> 00:32:31.700 align:start position:0%
in the case of foster care there's a
 
00:32:35.450 --> 00:32:35.460 align:start position:0%
12-month permanency hearing which then
 
00:32:37.430 --> 00:32:37.440 align:start position:0%
the adoption goes into effect at the
 
00:32:40.669 --> 00:32:40.679 align:start position:0%
24-month Mark that doesn't that hearing
 
00:32:42.409 --> 00:32:42.419 align:start position:0%
doesn't happen in the case of a
 
00:32:44.210 --> 00:32:44.220 align:start position:0%
consensual Guardianship and it seemed
 
00:32:45.950 --> 00:32:45.960 align:start position:0%
that that was the place that the change
 
00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
actually needed to take place
 
00:32:50.990 --> 00:32:51.000 align:start position:0%
but unfortunately is is a non-germaine
 
00:32:52.850 --> 00:32:52.860 align:start position:0%
Amendment which is why
 
00:32:55.789 --> 00:32:55.799 align:start position:0%
we were kind of locked on what
 
00:32:57.649 --> 00:32:57.659 align:start position:0%
we were limited with
 
00:33:01.850 --> 00:33:01.860 align:start position:0%
Michelle yes so given the light that we
 
00:33:03.289 --> 00:33:03.299 align:start position:0%
are I think we're all in agreement that
 
00:33:04.850 --> 00:33:04.860 align:start position:0%
we would like to see if we could do
 
00:33:06.649 --> 00:33:06.659 align:start position:0%
something could we retain this bill
 
00:33:11.149 --> 00:33:11.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:11.159 --> 00:33:12.250 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:33:12.250 --> 00:33:12.260 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:33:16.909 --> 00:33:16.919 align:start position:0%
can can I just uh uh if the question is
 
00:33:19.070 --> 00:33:19.080 align:start position:0%
can't could we retain it yeah I mean we
 
00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:21.480 align:start position:0%
could we could vote down the motion on
 
00:33:23.570 --> 00:33:23.580 align:start position:0%
the floors to itl we could if that
 
00:33:26.210 --> 00:33:26.220 align:start position:0%
motion failed then that we certainly
 
00:33:28.909 --> 00:33:28.919 align:start position:0%
could entertain a motion to retain I
 
00:33:30.769 --> 00:33:30.779 align:start position:0%
guess what I what I would say and I
 
00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:32.760 align:start position:0%
would recognize representative Manos in
 
00:33:33.950 --> 00:33:33.960 align:start position:0%
a moment
 
00:33:35.509 --> 00:33:35.519 align:start position:0%
um there's
 
00:33:39.169 --> 00:33:39.179 align:start position:0%
two two points that that I I think I I
 
00:33:41.509 --> 00:33:41.519 align:start position:0%
would make and I hope you'll consider
 
00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:43.440 align:start position:0%
the first is
 
00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:45.169 align:start position:0%
the first is
the

00:33:45.169 --> 00:33:45.179 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:33:49.970 --> 00:33:49.980 align:start position:0%
the problem I think with the proposal
 
00:33:54.289 --> 00:33:54.299 align:start position:0%
is is this as as the Troxel case points
 
00:33:56.090 --> 00:33:56.100 align:start position:0%
out and as the arena D in other cases
 
00:33:58.009 --> 00:33:58.019 align:start position:0%
and there's other cases from around the
 
00:33:59.750 --> 00:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
country point this out
 
00:34:04.070 --> 00:34:04.080 align:start position:0%
the parents have a fundamental right to
 
00:34:06.230 --> 00:34:06.240 align:start position:0%
the upbringing you know to raise and up
 
00:34:09.770 --> 00:34:09.780 align:start position:0%
and and uh bring up their their children
 
00:34:12.169 --> 00:34:12.179 align:start position:0%
and the problem
 
00:34:12.179 --> 00:34:14.329 align:start position:0%
and the problem
that

00:34:14.329 --> 00:34:14.339 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:34:16.849 --> 00:34:16.859 align:start position:0%
of with with this proposed amendment is
 
00:34:20.030 --> 00:34:20.040 align:start position:0%
this proposed amendment would say
 
00:34:23.389 --> 00:34:23.399 align:start position:0%
even if the a court
 
00:34:26.829 --> 00:34:26.839 align:start position:0%
were to conclude that the parents
 
00:34:29.629 --> 00:34:29.639 align:start position:0%
had you know cleaned up their acts so to
 
00:34:32.389 --> 00:34:32.399 align:start position:0%
speak so that they were now fit parents
 
00:34:36.169 --> 00:34:36.179 align:start position:0%
even if the court were satisfied that it
 
00:34:38.750 --> 00:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
was more probable than not that that was
 
00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:40.490 align:start position:0%
was more probable than not that that was
true

00:34:40.490 --> 00:34:40.500 align:start position:0%
true
 
00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:43.200 align:start position:0%
the parents would still lose because
 
00:34:45.649 --> 00:34:45.659 align:start position:0%
they hadn't satisfied this higher burden
 
00:34:48.349 --> 00:34:48.359 align:start position:0%
of clear and convincing evidence and so
 
00:34:50.210 --> 00:34:50.220 align:start position:0%
that what that really I mean if you stop
 
00:34:52.490 --> 00:34:52.500 align:start position:0%
and think about that that means you're
 
00:34:55.669 --> 00:34:55.679 align:start position:0%
you're a you're a fit parent you come
 
00:34:57.770 --> 00:34:57.780 align:start position:0%
into the court and you prove now that
 
00:34:59.390 --> 00:34:59.400 align:start position:0%
you're a fit parent whatever may have
 
00:35:02.210 --> 00:35:02.220 align:start position:0%
been your your past track record you now
 
00:35:04.010 --> 00:35:04.020 align:start position:0%
come in and you prove
 
00:35:05.990 --> 00:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
that it's more likely than not that
 
00:35:07.910 --> 00:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
you're a fit parent
 
00:35:10.069 --> 00:35:10.079 align:start position:0%
and you and you lose anyway
 
00:35:12.530 --> 00:35:12.540 align:start position:0%
that's I think where the Constitutional
 
00:35:15.770 --> 00:35:15.780 align:start position:0%
problem would come in to say that you
 
00:35:19.010 --> 00:35:19.020 align:start position:0%
can make it harder than that
 
00:35:21.530 --> 00:35:21.540 align:start position:0%
um so I that's that's why I have a real
 
00:35:23.569 --> 00:35:23.579 align:start position:0%
problem with the with the proposed
 
00:35:25.069 --> 00:35:25.079 align:start position:0%
amendment even though I am sympathetic
 
00:35:27.349 --> 00:35:27.359 align:start position:0%
to you know what people are saying the
 
00:35:28.609 --> 00:35:28.619 align:start position:0%
other thing that I the other thing that
 
00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:30.240 align:start position:0%
I would say and I hope you'll consider
 
00:35:32.089 --> 00:35:32.099 align:start position:0%
this is
 
00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:34.560 align:start position:0%
we the
 
00:35:37.730 --> 00:35:37.740 align:start position:0%
the main evidence in support of this
 
00:35:40.670 --> 00:35:40.680 align:start position:0%
bill comes from a a very compelling
 
00:35:44.450 --> 00:35:44.460 align:start position:0%
witness I uh who appeared before us
 
00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:45.950 align:start position:0%
witness I uh who appeared before us
but

00:35:45.950 --> 00:35:45.960 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:35:47.810 --> 00:35:47.820 align:start position:0%
gave us
 
00:35:52.010 --> 00:35:52.020 align:start position:0%
her side of a court case
 
00:35:54.349 --> 00:35:54.359 align:start position:0%
we never you know yesterday I was he I
 
00:35:55.730 --> 00:35:55.740 align:start position:0%
was working here yesterday preparing
 
00:35:57.050 --> 00:35:57.060 align:start position:0%
some amendments for some other things
 
00:35:59.450 --> 00:35:59.460 align:start position:0%
and the child and family committee I was
 
00:36:01.130 --> 00:36:01.140 align:start position:0%
in that office they were in years but I
 
00:36:02.810 --> 00:36:02.820 align:start position:0%
could hear a fair amount of what was
 
00:36:04.670 --> 00:36:04.680 align:start position:0%
going on
 
00:36:08.810 --> 00:36:08.820 align:start position:0%
there were any number of bills presented
 
00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
to change fundamentally in fundamental
 
00:36:15.230 --> 00:36:15.240 align:start position:0%
ways the the the way the family court
 
00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:17.890 align:start position:0%
ways the the the way the family court
operates

00:36:17.890 --> 00:36:17.900 align:start position:0%
operates
 
00:36:21.890 --> 00:36:21.900 align:start position:0%
many many of those bills based upon
 
00:36:24.550 --> 00:36:24.560 align:start position:0%
you know what somebody told somebody
 
00:36:27.050 --> 00:36:27.060 align:start position:0%
about a court case
 
00:36:30.589 --> 00:36:30.599 align:start position:0%
in which they got one side of the story
 
00:36:32.810 --> 00:36:32.820 align:start position:0%
one side of the story and that's what we
 
00:36:35.270 --> 00:36:35.280 align:start position:0%
got here we'd you know I please
 
00:36:36.950 --> 00:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
understand I'm not saying for a moment
 
00:36:38.750 --> 00:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
that judges don't make mistakes they do
 
00:36:40.970 --> 00:36:40.980 align:start position:0%
and in fact it appears from what I
 
00:36:42.829 --> 00:36:42.839 align:start position:0%
understand about this case of this that
 
00:36:45.349 --> 00:36:45.359 align:start position:0%
in fact the the you know the child ended
 
00:36:47.569 --> 00:36:47.579 align:start position:0%
up the parents ended up going back to
 
00:36:50.510 --> 00:36:50.520 align:start position:0%
drug dealing and whatever or drug abuse
 
00:36:53.270 --> 00:36:53.280 align:start position:0%
and the child was taken away again so
 
00:36:56.089 --> 00:36:56.099 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm not you know that which would
 
00:36:58.069 --> 00:36:58.079 align:start position:0%
that could indicate that that the court
 
00:37:00.170 --> 00:37:00.180 align:start position:0%
made a made the wrong decision so I'm
 
00:37:02.569 --> 00:37:02.579 align:start position:0%
not saying that courts never make
 
00:37:05.030 --> 00:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
incorrect decisions but what I am saying
 
00:37:06.710 --> 00:37:06.720 align:start position:0%
is I and I hope you'll just think about
 
00:37:09.230 --> 00:37:09.240 align:start position:0%
this is
 
00:37:12.790 --> 00:37:12.800 align:start position:0%
I think it's dangerous to legislate
 
00:37:16.210 --> 00:37:16.220 align:start position:0%
based on a particular case and getting
 
00:37:19.609 --> 00:37:19.619 align:start position:0%
one side of the story because I you know
 
00:37:23.510 --> 00:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
I I I I can remember last year and I got
 
00:37:25.849 --> 00:37:25.859 align:start position:0%
a particular legislator
 
00:37:27.950 --> 00:37:27.960 align:start position:0%
um coming to me a number of times and
 
00:37:29.510 --> 00:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
talking about you know this happened in
 
00:37:30.829 --> 00:37:30.839 align:start position:0%
this case and we needed to change the
 
00:37:32.450 --> 00:37:32.460 align:start position:0%
law we need to change the law
 
00:37:35.750 --> 00:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
and I you know on several occasions
 
00:37:39.829 --> 00:37:39.839 align:start position:0%
I I I I I thought to myself
 
00:37:41.930 --> 00:37:41.940 align:start position:0%
I think I have a pretty good sense of
 
00:37:44.390 --> 00:37:44.400 align:start position:0%
who the judges are in this state I don't
 
00:37:46.130 --> 00:37:46.140 align:start position:0%
know them all or by any means but I
 
00:37:47.150 --> 00:37:47.160 align:start position:0%
think I have a pretty good sense
 
00:37:49.250 --> 00:37:49.260 align:start position:0%
generally about this and and I remember
 
00:37:50.450 --> 00:37:50.460 align:start position:0%
saying to myself on a number of
 
00:37:50.460 --> 00:37:52.069 align:start position:0%
saying to myself on a number of
occasions

00:37:52.069 --> 00:37:52.079 align:start position:0%
occasions
 
00:37:55.430 --> 00:37:55.440 align:start position:0%
even in the worst you know think about
 
00:37:57.829 --> 00:37:57.839 align:start position:0%
the person that I think the least of as
 
00:38:01.069 --> 00:38:01.079 align:start position:0%
a judge in the state and that was having
 
00:38:03.650 --> 00:38:03.660 align:start position:0%
a bad day and maybe had a little too
 
00:38:06.410 --> 00:38:06.420 align:start position:0%
much to drink the night before even in
 
00:38:09.230 --> 00:38:09.240 align:start position:0%
that circumstance this judge would not
 
00:38:11.390 --> 00:38:11.400 align:start position:0%
could not have made the decision that
 
00:38:14.150 --> 00:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
was suggested on the facts that were
 
00:38:16.670 --> 00:38:16.680 align:start position:0%
related to me it's just you know
 
00:38:17.990 --> 00:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
incredible that that could have happened
 
00:38:19.550 --> 00:38:19.560 align:start position:0%
which tells me
 
00:38:22.430 --> 00:38:22.440 align:start position:0%
there must have been another side to the
 
00:38:24.770 --> 00:38:24.780 align:start position:0%
story and of course we
 
00:38:26.329 --> 00:38:26.339 align:start position:0%
you know we don't have that we haven't
 
00:38:28.310 --> 00:38:28.320 align:start position:0%
read the transcript of this of this case
 
00:38:30.589 --> 00:38:30.599 align:start position:0%
or those cases or anything so I guess I
 
00:38:32.569 --> 00:38:32.579 align:start position:0%
just say I think it's kind of important
 
00:38:34.810 --> 00:38:34.820 align:start position:0%
that to put that in perspective
 
00:38:38.089 --> 00:38:38.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:40.190 --> 00:38:40.200 align:start position:0%
just underlined what you said in your
 
00:38:41.810 --> 00:38:41.820 align:start position:0%
comments were
 
00:38:44.690 --> 00:38:44.700 align:start position:0%
um on the spot I I many many years ago
 
00:38:46.250 --> 00:38:46.260 align:start position:0%
we very briefly a thing called the
 
00:38:47.810 --> 00:38:47.820 align:start position:0%
petitions and redress committee which
 
00:38:49.849 --> 00:38:49.859 align:start position:0%
was a failed experiment and that was
 
00:38:51.410 --> 00:38:51.420 align:start position:0%
almost entirely
 
00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
it's predominant almost entirely people
 
00:38:56.270 --> 00:38:56.280 align:start position:0%
very civil cases have gone sideways I'm
 
00:39:00.530 --> 00:39:00.540 align:start position:0%
usually defendants and family law cases
 
00:39:04.310 --> 00:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
and uh of course they would usually
 
00:39:06.050 --> 00:39:06.060 align:start position:0%
even if they brought documents that you
 
00:39:07.670 --> 00:39:07.680 align:start position:0%
would usually only bring copies of their
 
00:39:09.290 --> 00:39:09.300 align:start position:0%
own documents like the ones for their
 
00:39:11.450 --> 00:39:11.460 align:start position:0%
case which is understandable and then it
 
00:39:13.190 --> 00:39:13.200 align:start position:0%
was pretty easy
 
00:39:16.130 --> 00:39:16.140 align:start position:0%
pretty easy to pull a file if the case
 
00:39:18.170 --> 00:39:18.180 align:start position:0%
is gone to the Supreme Court it's a very
 
00:39:21.410 --> 00:39:21.420 align:start position:0%
the clerk of Clerk of very like will
 
00:39:22.790 --> 00:39:22.800 align:start position:0%
very in a few minutes bring you the case
 
00:39:24.109 --> 00:39:24.119 align:start position:0%
File and you can sit out there and read
 
00:39:26.569 --> 00:39:26.579 align:start position:0%
it just about every case I found that
 
00:39:28.849 --> 00:39:28.859 align:start position:0%
there were like fairly severe
 
00:39:30.589 --> 00:39:30.599 align:start position:0%
there's a fairly severe difference
 
00:39:33.589 --> 00:39:33.599 align:start position:0%
between what we were told happened in
 
00:39:35.089 --> 00:39:35.099 align:start position:0%
the case and what the case File actually
 
00:39:37.069 --> 00:39:37.079 align:start position:0%
reflected so there's usually
 
00:39:38.930 --> 00:39:38.940 align:start position:0%
there's usually a rationale for what the
 
00:39:40.670 --> 00:39:40.680 align:start position:0%
other side of these cases were doing not
 
00:39:42.530 --> 00:39:42.540 align:start position:0%
to say that necessarily all the
 
00:39:44.510 --> 00:39:44.520 align:start position:0%
Commissioners were wrong or they're all
 
00:39:46.310 --> 00:39:46.320 align:start position:0%
right but like
 
00:39:48.290 --> 00:39:48.300 align:start position:0%
um there's one particularly amusing case
 
00:39:49.910 --> 00:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
where he was always saying the judge was
 
00:39:52.069 --> 00:39:52.079 align:start position:0%
doing things for no discernible or
 
00:39:55.130 --> 00:39:55.140 align:start position:0%
rational reasons so you'd I finally got
 
00:39:56.750 --> 00:39:56.760 align:start position:0%
hold of his case File which was like
 
00:39:58.250 --> 00:39:58.260 align:start position:0%
particularly long I think he had like a
 
00:40:00.770 --> 00:40:00.780 align:start position:0%
thousand items in the docket and uh
 
00:40:02.930 --> 00:40:02.940 align:start position:0%
in every case there was a discernible or
 
00:40:05.030 --> 00:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
rational reason for what the what the
 
00:40:06.710 --> 00:40:06.720 align:start position:0%
court did you know so
 
00:40:08.390 --> 00:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
so that's uh
 
00:40:10.069 --> 00:40:10.079 align:start position:0%
so that is a problem with legislating
 
00:40:13.270 --> 00:40:13.280 align:start position:0%
based on one party's uh possibly
 
00:40:15.530 --> 00:40:15.540 align:start position:0%
one-sided and often very incomplete
 
00:40:16.970 --> 00:40:16.980 align:start position:0%
summary of what happened in the court
 
00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:20.640 align:start position:0%
case thanks representative
 
00:40:22.910 --> 00:40:22.920 align:start position:0%
would it be possible for us to do some
 
00:40:25.730 --> 00:40:25.740 align:start position:0%
sort of a A subcommittee or like little
 
00:40:27.710 --> 00:40:27.720 align:start position:0%
study with a few of us to possibly
 
00:40:30.050 --> 00:40:30.060 align:start position:0%
propose a bill for next year rather than
 
00:40:31.490 --> 00:40:31.500 align:start position:0%
retain this one because I just don't
 
00:40:34.069 --> 00:40:34.079 align:start position:0%
think this is the area that it would go
 
00:40:35.750 --> 00:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
in I think it would be a whole new bill
 
00:40:38.030 --> 00:40:38.040 align:start position:0%
is there any way that we could
 
00:40:40.970 --> 00:40:40.980 align:start position:0%
do some little subgroup with us
 
00:40:43.069 --> 00:40:43.079 align:start position:0%
I'm sure I mean the answer to that that
 
00:40:44.630 --> 00:40:44.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to be something that's done
 
00:40:46.550 --> 00:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
the answer is yes but that doesn't I
 
00:40:48.770 --> 00:40:48.780 align:start position:0%
think that's not something that we sort
 
00:40:51.829 --> 00:40:51.839 align:start position:0%
of have to act upon here yeah Yuka you
 
00:40:53.810 --> 00:40:53.820 align:start position:0%
may you know you I mean I would
 
00:40:55.790 --> 00:40:55.800 align:start position:0%
encourage anybody on this you know this
 
00:40:57.109 --> 00:40:57.119 align:start position:0%
committee and if there's other you know
 
00:40:58.310 --> 00:40:58.320 align:start position:0%
other committees that have an interest
 
00:40:59.810 --> 00:40:59.820 align:start position:0%
in it maybe child and family or whatever
 
00:41:01.910 --> 00:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
if if you think you have you know ideas
 
00:41:05.630 --> 00:41:05.640 align:start position:0%
for for making the law better I I you
 
00:41:06.890 --> 00:41:06.900 align:start position:0%
certainly should do that and I would
 
00:41:10.310 --> 00:41:10.320 align:start position:0%
encourage it yes representative Perez
 
00:41:12.349 --> 00:41:12.359 align:start position:0%
in my notes and correct me if I'm wrong
 
00:41:14.990 --> 00:41:15.000 align:start position:0%
because again I apologize I'm going to
 
00:41:16.910 --> 00:41:16.920 align:start position:0%
use the excuse It's new but I have in my
 
00:41:19.010 --> 00:41:19.020 align:start position:0%
notes that I'm Brian Clark
 
00:41:23.690 --> 00:41:23.700 align:start position:0%
testified and I have written down dcyf
 
00:41:26.030 --> 00:41:26.040 align:start position:0%
wants to keep
 
00:41:29.030 --> 00:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
clear and convincing
 
00:41:30.530 --> 00:41:30.540 align:start position:0%
I think that might have been on the
 
00:41:34.069 --> 00:41:34.079 align:start position:0%
first part yeah that was an in section B
 
00:41:36.050 --> 00:41:36.060 align:start position:0%
and they have been neutral to the change
 
00:41:38.750 --> 00:41:38.760 align:start position:0%
in section c but I should note that dcyf
 
00:41:42.550 --> 00:41:42.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't have involvement with the
 
00:41:45.349 --> 00:41:45.359 align:start position:0%
consensual guardianships typically and
 
00:41:47.030 --> 00:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
so that's why they were neutral on it
 
00:41:48.470 --> 00:41:48.480 align:start position:0%
because they have limited involvement
 
00:41:50.089 --> 00:41:50.099 align:start position:0%
but the clear and convincing they were
 
00:41:51.650 --> 00:41:51.660 align:start position:0%
just saying please don't make the change
 
00:41:53.990 --> 00:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
in in Part B which is why I had made the
 
00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:56.750 align:start position:0%
in in Part B which is why I had made the
amendment

00:41:56.750 --> 00:41:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:59.510 --> 00:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
Mr here yes representative D Lorenzo
 
00:42:01.310 --> 00:42:01.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:42:03.890 --> 00:42:03.900 align:start position:0%
um I think that we are looking at this
 
00:42:07.010 --> 00:42:07.020 align:start position:0%
issue through a very narrow lens
 
00:42:09.470 --> 00:42:09.480 align:start position:0%
um a parent a parents could lose custody
 
00:42:11.630 --> 00:42:11.640 align:start position:0%
of their children due to no fault of
 
00:42:13.490 --> 00:42:13.500 align:start position:0%
their own such as
 
00:42:15.710 --> 00:42:15.720 align:start position:0%
um mental health a physical disability
 
00:42:18.770 --> 00:42:18.780 align:start position:0%
so I think that when we do look at this
 
00:42:21.050 --> 00:42:21.060 align:start position:0%
bill again we need to look at it with a
 
00:42:23.210 --> 00:42:23.220 align:start position:0%
wider scope thank you
 
00:42:25.790 --> 00:42:25.800 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to come yes
 
00:42:27.410 --> 00:42:27.420 align:start position:0%
representative Manos
 
00:42:30.050 --> 00:42:30.060 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to suggest that one reason
 
00:42:32.450 --> 00:42:32.460 align:start position:0%
not to retain it is because jurisdiction
 
00:42:34.790 --> 00:42:34.800 align:start position:0%
might lie with children and family law
 
00:42:37.370 --> 00:42:37.380 align:start position:0%
and so I agree with representative
 
00:42:40.490 --> 00:42:40.500 align:start position:0%
koutab that um
 
00:42:43.250 --> 00:42:43.260 align:start position:0%
looking at it further individually or as
 
00:42:45.650 --> 00:42:45.660 align:start position:0%
a smaller group informally would be the
 
00:42:48.950 --> 00:42:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:52.430 --> 00:42:52.440 align:start position:0%

00:45:16.670 --> 00:45:16.680 align:start position:0%
uh House Bill 320
 
00:45:19.250 --> 00:45:19.260 align:start position:0%
is attempting to
 
00:45:22.550 --> 00:45:22.560 align:start position:0%
prevent social media platforms from
 
00:45:26.390 --> 00:45:26.400 align:start position:0%
censoring content posted by users and
 
00:45:29.750 --> 00:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
that is we have
 
00:45:31.670 --> 00:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
we have seen over the last few years
 
00:45:35.450 --> 00:45:35.460 align:start position:0%
where this has occurred and in great
 
00:45:40.490 --> 00:45:40.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:42.410 --> 00:45:42.420 align:start position:0%
federal law
 
00:45:44.410 --> 00:45:44.420 align:start position:0%
distinguishes between
 
00:45:47.450 --> 00:45:47.460 align:start position:0%
platforms and Publishers this is section
 
00:45:52.430 --> 00:45:52.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:56.390 --> 00:45:56.400 align:start position:0%
a platform is one in which the social
 
00:45:56.400 --> 00:45:57.710 align:start position:0%
a platform is one in which the social
media

00:45:57.710 --> 00:45:57.720 align:start position:0%
media
 
00:46:01.550 --> 00:46:01.560 align:start position:0%
company allows users to post the
 
00:46:03.950 --> 00:46:03.960 align:start position:0%
comments and such that that the users
 
00:46:07.550 --> 00:46:07.560 align:start position:0%
want to post on there and within a
 
00:46:11.109 --> 00:46:11.119 align:start position:0%
reasonable amount of content regulation
 
00:46:14.390 --> 00:46:14.400 align:start position:0%
uh these the social media platform is
 
00:46:17.210 --> 00:46:17.220 align:start position:0%
able to they allow them to you post
 
00:46:19.309 --> 00:46:19.319 align:start position:0%
whatever those things are and without
 
00:46:22.030 --> 00:46:22.040 align:start position:0%
liability for those comments
 
00:46:26.930 --> 00:46:26.940 align:start position:0%
in contrast to a publisher where the uh
 
00:46:29.329 --> 00:46:29.339 align:start position:0%
the social media company would then be
 
00:46:32.089 --> 00:46:32.099 align:start position:0%
actually controlling what is posted what
 
00:46:34.190 --> 00:46:34.200 align:start position:0%
is not posted and so when censorship
 
00:46:35.809 --> 00:46:35.819 align:start position:0%
takes place
 
00:46:38.930 --> 00:46:38.940 align:start position:0%
uh they become a a publisher and not a
 
00:46:42.530 --> 00:46:42.540 align:start position:0%
platform and should therefore not be uh
 
00:46:44.089 --> 00:46:44.099 align:start position:0%
should not be protected by by the
 
00:46:45.349 --> 00:46:45.359 align:start position:0%
liability protections that they're
 
00:46:48.109 --> 00:46:48.119 align:start position:0%
granted so while this bill
 
00:46:52.190 --> 00:46:52.200 align:start position:0%
seeks to uh to accomplish the the
 
00:46:55.670 --> 00:46:55.680 align:start position:0%
purpose of preventing censorship I don't
 
00:46:58.370 --> 00:46:58.380 align:start position:0%
see how we can actually enforce this
 
00:47:01.130 --> 00:47:01.140 align:start position:0%
uh it would be very very difficult at
 
00:47:03.589 --> 00:47:03.599 align:start position:0%
best to do that however I think even in
 
00:47:05.990 --> 00:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
italing the bill
 
00:47:08.690 --> 00:47:08.700 align:start position:0%
we can send a very strong statement to
 
00:47:11.510 --> 00:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
these social media platforms that
 
00:47:13.910 --> 00:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
platforms is reminding them that they
 
00:47:16.490 --> 00:47:16.500 align:start position:0%
are platforms and not Publishers and
 
00:47:18.470 --> 00:47:18.480 align:start position:0%
that censorship is not it should not be
 
00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:20.510 align:start position:0%
that censorship is not it should not be
tolerated

00:47:20.510 --> 00:47:20.520 align:start position:0%
tolerated
 
00:47:22.670 --> 00:47:22.680 align:start position:0%
right other people wish to yes
 
00:47:24.890 --> 00:47:24.900 align:start position:0%
representative Horrigan please well I'm
 
00:47:28.490 --> 00:47:28.500 align:start position:0%
I'm certainly a very huge free speech
 
00:47:30.650 --> 00:47:30.660 align:start position:0%
and freedom of the press uh
 
00:47:32.809 --> 00:47:32.819 align:start position:0%
advocate of well first of all of course
 
00:47:36.290 --> 00:47:36.300 align:start position:0%
it's not Freedom press includes the
 
00:47:39.650 --> 00:47:39.660 align:start position:0%
um option to not print things you don't
 
00:47:42.230 --> 00:47:42.240 align:start position:0%
want to print so like you know it's if I
 
00:47:44.210 --> 00:47:44.220 align:start position:0%
post something on a Twitter or Facebook
 
00:47:46.609 --> 00:47:46.619 align:start position:0%
it's not my press it's their press and
 
00:47:48.109 --> 00:47:48.119 align:start position:0%
they have to do
 
00:47:49.849 --> 00:47:49.859 align:start position:0%
a certain amount of content moderation
 
00:47:52.190 --> 00:47:52.200 align:start position:0%
you can call it censorship uh first of
 
00:47:54.170 --> 00:47:54.180 align:start position:0%
all there's a lot of stuff that
 
00:47:55.730 --> 00:47:55.740 align:start position:0%
that people
 
00:47:57.710 --> 00:47:57.720 align:start position:0%
some people want to post which nobody
 
00:47:59.569 --> 00:47:59.579 align:start position:0%
wants to see you know nobody wants to
 
00:48:02.630 --> 00:48:02.640 align:start position:0%
see uh work from home scams or just you
 
00:48:06.230 --> 00:48:06.240 align:start position:0%
know incoherent Nazi rants or uh you
 
00:48:09.710 --> 00:48:09.720 align:start position:0%
know or that sort of area there's all
 
00:48:11.089 --> 00:48:11.099 align:start position:0%
kinds of things that you're gonna people
 
00:48:12.829 --> 00:48:12.839 align:start position:0%
gonna try to post on any platform which
 
00:48:14.690 --> 00:48:14.700 align:start position:0%
will just clutter up the platform and
 
00:48:15.950 --> 00:48:15.960 align:start position:0%
also even
 
00:48:17.809 --> 00:48:17.819 align:start position:0%
so and also even in terms of political
 
00:48:20.150 --> 00:48:20.160 align:start position:0%
debate and maybe that's kind of in a
 
00:48:21.890 --> 00:48:21.900 align:start position:0%
fortunate things in some ways but
 
00:48:21.900 --> 00:48:22.730 align:start position:0%
fortunate things in some ways but
they're

00:48:22.730 --> 00:48:22.740 align:start position:0%
they're
 
00:48:24.710 --> 00:48:24.720 align:start position:0%
they're in the business of uh you know
 
00:48:25.790 --> 00:48:25.800 align:start position:0%
they're basically in the business
 
00:48:27.950 --> 00:48:27.960 align:start position:0%
they're providing these services for uh
 
00:48:30.609 --> 00:48:30.619 align:start position:0%
for free in exchange for us being
 
00:48:34.309 --> 00:48:34.319 align:start position:0%
exposed to some some advertising now and
 
00:48:36.290 --> 00:48:36.300 align:start position:0%
then and um people aren't going to log
 
00:48:38.270 --> 00:48:38.280 align:start position:0%
on to the service unless it's stuff that
 
00:48:38.280 --> 00:48:39.050 align:start position:0%
on to the service unless it's stuff that
they

00:48:39.050 --> 00:48:39.060 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:48:42.349 --> 00:48:42.359 align:start position:0%
enjoy reading not necessarily just stuff
 
00:48:44.870 --> 00:48:44.880 align:start position:0%
that they agree with you know it
 
00:48:46.790 --> 00:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be fun to see a social media
 
00:48:48.829 --> 00:48:48.839 align:start position:0%
site where everybody agreed with me but
 
00:48:49.970 --> 00:48:49.980 align:start position:0%
it has to be
 
00:48:51.650 --> 00:48:51.660 align:start position:0%
you know it has to be
 
00:48:53.750 --> 00:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
if it's not like within the if it's not
 
00:48:55.190 --> 00:48:55.200 align:start position:0%
within certain parameters and I'm
 
00:48:56.930 --> 00:48:56.940 align:start position:0%
willing to look at uh you know I'm not
 
00:48:58.609 --> 00:48:58.619 align:start position:0%
going to log on the site nobody else is
 
00:49:01.190 --> 00:49:01.200 align:start position:0%
going to log on to the uh the site so we
 
00:49:03.109 --> 00:49:03.119 align:start position:0%
some extent we have to respect their
 
00:49:04.970 --> 00:49:04.980 align:start position:0%
business model unless the market will
 
00:49:06.710 --> 00:49:06.720 align:start position:0%
correct it uh
 
00:49:09.290 --> 00:49:09.300 align:start position:0%
correct it somewhat you know sites that
 
00:49:11.450 --> 00:49:11.460 align:start position:0%
aren't interesting to read sites that
 
00:49:12.770 --> 00:49:12.780 align:start position:0%
are offensive to read people will
 
00:49:14.510 --> 00:49:14.520 align:start position:0%
migrate away from them and go to other
 
00:49:16.370 --> 00:49:16.380 align:start position:0%
sites and then they also come and go
 
00:49:18.050 --> 00:49:18.060 align:start position:0%
anyway over the course of time just
 
00:49:19.730 --> 00:49:19.740 align:start position:0%
because of natural Revolution like you
 
00:49:20.930 --> 00:49:20.940 align:start position:0%
know one time
 
00:49:23.510 --> 00:49:23.520 align:start position:0%
AOL and CompuServe dominated the social
 
00:49:26.270 --> 00:49:26.280 align:start position:0%
media space and you know now they
 
00:49:29.089 --> 00:49:29.099 align:start position:0%
ol will kind of exists but you know
 
00:49:30.710 --> 00:49:30.720 align:start position:0%
compenserve doesn't exist and I'm sure
 
00:49:31.790 --> 00:49:31.800 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:49:33.950 --> 00:49:33.960 align:start position:0%
same will happen eventually to Facebook
 
00:49:36.130 --> 00:49:36.140 align:start position:0%
and Twitter and the like so new new
 
00:49:39.530 --> 00:49:39.540 align:start position:0%
platforms do come and go so I I um their
 
00:49:41.390 --> 00:49:41.400 align:start position:0%
Monopoly power is not
 
00:49:44.210 --> 00:49:44.220 align:start position:0%
I mean it can be troubling uh sometimes
 
00:49:46.490 --> 00:49:46.500 align:start position:0%
but um especially especially in the case
 
00:49:47.809 --> 00:49:47.819 align:start position:0%
of Twitter we had an eccentric
 
00:49:49.970 --> 00:49:49.980 align:start position:0%
billionaire bought it and I really don't
 
00:49:51.650 --> 00:49:51.660 align:start position:0%
exactly understand what he's up to half
 
00:49:53.030 --> 00:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
the time but
 
00:49:56.270 --> 00:49:56.280 align:start position:0%
I think uh so I think the concern buying
 
00:49:57.950 --> 00:49:57.960 align:start position:0%
this pill is is exaggerated the
 
00:50:00.050 --> 00:50:00.060 align:start position:0%
marketplace will correct it eventually
 
00:50:01.609 --> 00:50:01.619 align:start position:0%
and also um
 
00:50:04.130 --> 00:50:04.140 align:start position:0%
also of course this is a federal issue
 
00:50:06.589 --> 00:50:06.599 align:start position:0%
so we have very limited uh purview over
 
00:50:08.210 --> 00:50:08.220 align:start position:0%
this so the only thing
 
00:50:09.950 --> 00:50:09.960 align:start position:0%
this might accomplish would be for
 
00:50:12.109 --> 00:50:12.119 align:start position:0%
social media services to start redlining
 
00:50:14.210 --> 00:50:14.220 align:start position:0%
users a Believer from New Hampshire and
 
00:50:15.589 --> 00:50:15.599 align:start position:0%
that would certainly not be good
 
00:50:16.910 --> 00:50:16.920 align:start position:0%
especially if you want to keep our first
 
00:50:19.430 --> 00:50:19.440 align:start position:0%
the nation primary so I would
 
00:50:20.809 --> 00:50:20.819 align:start position:0%
I would agree for slightly different
 
00:50:23.809 --> 00:50:23.819 align:start position:0%
reasons that we said itl this bill and
 
00:50:23.819 --> 00:50:25.370 align:start position:0%
reasons that we said itl this bill and
thanks

00:50:25.370 --> 00:50:25.380 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
00:50:28.250 --> 00:50:28.260 align:start position:0%
yes representative Turner yeah just one
 
00:50:29.870 --> 00:50:29.880 align:start position:0%
other point that I think is worth making
 
00:50:32.630 --> 00:50:32.640 align:start position:0%
sure we draw out is uh during during the
 
00:50:37.430 --> 00:50:37.440 align:start position:0%
testimony in section 359 u4
 
00:50:39.349 --> 00:50:39.359 align:start position:0%
um it basically came out that that
 
00:50:41.930 --> 00:50:41.940 align:start position:0%
anyone essentially who has any
 
00:50:44.230 --> 00:50:44.240 align:start position:0%
interaction with anyone in social media
 
00:50:47.089 --> 00:50:47.099 align:start position:0%
that touches New Hampshire would have
 
00:50:50.210 --> 00:50:50.220 align:start position:0%
potential standing for this which could
 
00:50:53.530 --> 00:50:53.540 align:start position:0%
open up New Hampshire as as the the
 
00:50:56.630 --> 00:50:56.640 align:start position:0%
grounds where all cases of social media
 
00:50:58.849 --> 00:50:58.859 align:start position:0%
because this doesn't Exist Elsewhere
 
00:51:02.329 --> 00:51:02.339 align:start position:0%
um would be viably heard no matter where
 
00:51:04.250 --> 00:51:04.260 align:start position:0%
you lived in the world and related was
 
00:51:06.770 --> 00:51:06.780 align:start position:0%
the question of needing these social
 
00:51:08.450 --> 00:51:08.460 align:start position:0%
media platforms to then collect
 
00:51:10.250 --> 00:51:10.260 align:start position:0%
information about where you physically
 
00:51:12.170 --> 00:51:12.180 align:start position:0%
were at a given time in both of those I
 
00:51:15.589 --> 00:51:15.599 align:start position:0%
think are really uh uh difficult issues
 
00:51:17.450 --> 00:51:17.460 align:start position:0%
to overcome
 
00:51:18.710 --> 00:51:18.720 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
00:51:21.290 --> 00:51:21.300 align:start position:0%
so I guess I'm I have to say that I'm
 
00:51:23.030 --> 00:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
I'm going to vote for this motion and
 
00:51:27.349 --> 00:51:27.359 align:start position:0%
I'm uh I I support it I but I I am torn
 
00:51:30.530 --> 00:51:30.540 align:start position:0%
about the about this because I do I I do
 
00:51:32.510 --> 00:51:32.520 align:start position:0%
think it's really unfortunate that
 
00:51:34.309 --> 00:51:34.319 align:start position:0%
there's been
 
00:51:35.750 --> 00:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
um that that
 
00:51:38.210 --> 00:51:38.220 align:start position:0%
the social media platforms have chosen
 
00:51:40.970 --> 00:51:40.980 align:start position:0%
to build to sort of behave
 
00:51:42.950 --> 00:51:42.960 align:start position:0%
um in the for lack of a better term sort
 
00:51:45.710 --> 00:51:45.720 align:start position:0%
of woke manner that many of them have
 
00:51:47.809 --> 00:51:47.819 align:start position:0%
um but
 
00:51:51.410 --> 00:51:51.420 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned that the that the medicine
 
00:51:54.109 --> 00:51:54.119 align:start position:0%
may be the Cure may be worse than the
 
00:51:56.569 --> 00:51:56.579 align:start position:0%
disease and in particular
 
00:51:59.329 --> 00:51:59.339 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm really worried about what the
 
00:52:03.290 --> 00:52:03.300 align:start position:0%
implications would be about holding some
 
00:52:06.770 --> 00:52:06.780 align:start position:0%
of you know Google or Twitter or the
 
00:52:09.770 --> 00:52:09.780 align:start position:0%
Facebook whatever to be Public Utilities
 
00:52:12.349 --> 00:52:12.359 align:start position:0%
I'm not quite sure that the analogy
 
00:52:16.010 --> 00:52:16.020 align:start position:0%
between that and you know eversource uh
 
00:52:20.990 --> 00:52:21.000 align:start position:0%
or at T holds and I'm I'm concerned that
 
00:52:24.470 --> 00:52:24.480 align:start position:0%
there would be other implications
 
00:52:26.930 --> 00:52:26.940 align:start position:0%
um that uh
 
00:52:29.329 --> 00:52:29.339 align:start position:0%
frankly those of us who believe in kind
 
00:52:30.950 --> 00:52:30.960 align:start position:0%
of limited government and let the free
 
00:52:33.589 --> 00:52:33.599 align:start position:0%
market do its thing would not be happy
 
00:52:33.599 --> 00:52:35.030 align:start position:0%
market do its thing would not be happy
with

00:52:35.030 --> 00:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:52:37.730 --> 00:52:37.740 align:start position:0%
um so that on balance
 
00:52:39.589 --> 00:52:39.599 align:start position:0%
um that's why I come out to support the
 
00:52:43.130 --> 00:52:43.140 align:start position:0%
itl and I have to note as as I think a
 
00:52:44.450 --> 00:52:44.460 align:start position:0%
couple of people have pointed out but
 
00:52:46.370 --> 00:52:46.380 align:start position:0%
you know I just just to give you an
 
00:52:46.380 --> 00:52:47.270 align:start position:0%
you know I just just to give you an
example

00:52:47.270 --> 00:52:47.280 align:start position:0%
example
 
00:52:51.349 --> 00:52:51.359 align:start position:0%
this bill proposes to uh for Protect
 
00:52:53.990 --> 00:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
free speech
 
00:52:57.349 --> 00:52:57.359 align:start position:0%
um uh on the on these platforms but then
 
00:53:02.809 --> 00:53:02.819 align:start position:0%
if you if you look at section uh u43 and
 
00:53:05.870 --> 00:53:05.880 align:start position:0%
I'm quoting here this chapter does not
 
00:53:08.270 --> 00:53:08.280 align:start position:0%
prohibit an interactive Computer Service
 
00:53:11.210 --> 00:53:11.220 align:start position:0%
social media platform from merely
 
00:53:14.630 --> 00:53:14.640 align:start position:0%
providing expression to a user in a
 
00:53:17.329 --> 00:53:17.339 align:start position:0%
particular instance in response to that
 
00:53:19.849 --> 00:53:19.859 align:start position:0%
user's Express request in that
 
00:53:22.490 --> 00:53:22.500 align:start position:0%
particular instance for expression
 
00:53:24.650 --> 00:53:24.660 align:start position:0%
limited on the basis of viewpoint or
 
00:53:27.410 --> 00:53:27.420 align:start position:0%
geographic location I'm not
 
00:53:29.270 --> 00:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
I'm not quite sure I know what that
 
00:53:31.130 --> 00:53:31.140 align:start position:0%
means but it would seem to me that that
 
00:53:33.650 --> 00:53:33.660 align:start position:0%
would allow you could drive a lot of
 
00:53:36.349 --> 00:53:36.359 align:start position:0%
Mack Trucks through that uh through that
 
00:53:39.890 --> 00:53:39.900 align:start position:0%
exception and uh which I think kind of
 
00:53:43.069 --> 00:53:43.079 align:start position:0%
shows that there's that this is
 
00:53:44.750 --> 00:53:44.760 align:start position:0%
problematic so anyway
 
00:53:46.250 --> 00:53:46.260 align:start position:0%
um enough on that but that's why I'm
 
00:53:48.770 --> 00:53:48.780 align:start position:0%
gonna I'm gonna vote in favor of the itl
 
00:53:48.780 --> 00:53:49.910 align:start position:0%
gonna I'm gonna vote in favor of the itl
motion

00:53:49.910 --> 00:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
motion
 
00:53:52.670 --> 00:53:52.680 align:start position:0%
anyone else have anything uh
 
00:53:55.370 --> 00:53:55.380 align:start position:0%
to say all right are you ready for the
 
00:53:55.380 --> 00:53:56.450 align:start position:0%
to say all right are you ready for the
question

00:53:56.450 --> 00:53:56.460 align:start position:0%

00:55:04.849 --> 00:55:04.859 align:start position:0%
any reason
 
00:55:11.210 --> 00:55:11.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:12.950 --> 00:55:12.960 align:start position:0%
all right

all right
 
00:55:14.819 --> 00:55:16.130 align:start position:0%
all right
um

00:55:16.130 --> 00:55:16.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:22.609 --> 00:55:22.619 align:start position:0%
next uh return to uh HB uh 171 FN and
 
00:55:24.230 --> 00:55:24.240 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
 
00:55:26.030 --> 00:55:26.040 align:start position:0%
Alexander for a motion thank you Mr
 
00:55:29.210 --> 00:55:29.220 align:start position:0%
chair I move HP 171 in expedient to
 
00:55:31.490 --> 00:55:31.500 align:start position:0%
legislative I'm going to second that
 
00:55:34.390 --> 00:55:34.400 align:start position:0%
motion uh is there at representative
 
00:55:36.530 --> 00:55:36.540 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander would you like
 
00:55:38.569 --> 00:55:38.579 align:start position:0%
to speak to that yes thank you Mr chair
 
00:55:39.950 --> 00:55:39.960 align:start position:0%
um the bill would change definition by
 
00:55:41.630 --> 00:55:41.640 align:start position:0%
adding a requirement
 
00:55:42.890 --> 00:55:42.900 align:start position:0%
um employee I'm reading from the fiscal
 
00:55:45.170 --> 00:55:45.180 align:start position:0%
note employer officials decisions
 
00:55:46.970 --> 00:55:46.980 align:start position:0%
um or a mission to be discretionary
 
00:55:49.190 --> 00:55:49.200 align:start position:0%
rather than ministerial
 
00:55:50.930 --> 00:55:50.940 align:start position:0%
um this opens up more lawsuits for
 
00:55:52.609 --> 00:55:52.619 align:start position:0%
ministerial functions which expand
 
00:55:54.589 --> 00:55:54.599 align:start position:0%
liability for
 
00:55:57.049 --> 00:55:57.059 align:start position:0%
um our state and local governments um I
 
00:55:59.390 --> 00:55:59.400 align:start position:0%
see no reason to expand a liability
 
00:56:01.130 --> 00:56:01.140 align:start position:0%
right at this time I think the bill is
 
00:56:01.140 --> 00:56:02.510 align:start position:0%
right at this time I think the bill is
formatted

00:56:02.510 --> 00:56:02.520 align:start position:0%
formatted
 
00:56:02.520 --> 00:56:03.470 align:start position:0%
formatted
um

00:56:03.470 --> 00:56:03.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:06.349 --> 00:56:06.359 align:start position:0%
formatted also incorrect like not in a
 
00:56:08.150 --> 00:56:08.160 align:start position:0%
good way so I just hope that the
 
00:56:09.950 --> 00:56:09.960 align:start position:0%
committee would join me in
 
00:56:12.710 --> 00:56:12.720 align:start position:0%
itl in this bill I think
 
00:56:12.720 --> 00:56:14.150 align:start position:0%
itl in this bill I think
um

00:56:14.150 --> 00:56:14.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:16.309 --> 00:56:16.319 align:start position:0%
there are other bills that the committee
 
00:56:18.589 --> 00:56:18.599 align:start position:0%
will look at as well that
 
00:56:18.599 --> 00:56:19.309 align:start position:0%
will look at as well that
um

00:56:19.309 --> 00:56:19.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:21.290 --> 00:56:21.300 align:start position:0%
have to do with the same subject area so
 
00:56:22.790 --> 00:56:22.800 align:start position:0%
with that I hope you join me in ideal
 
00:56:25.069 --> 00:56:25.079 align:start position:0%
all right anyone else wish to speak to
 
00:56:27.530 --> 00:56:27.540 align:start position:0%
HB 171
 
00:56:28.790 --> 00:56:28.800 align:start position:0%
all right are we ready for the question
 
00:56:33.290 --> 00:56:33.300 align:start position:0%
then uh on House Bill 171 on the motion
 
00:56:34.910 --> 00:56:34.920 align:start position:0%
of inner speaking to legislate I would
 
00:56:36.589 --> 00:56:36.599 align:start position:0%
ask the clerk to put please call the
 
00:56:36.599 --> 00:56:38.390 align:start position:0%
ask the clerk to put please call the
rule

again it's any reason that that cannot

um
 
00:57:35.870 --> 00:57:35.880 align:start position:0%
next uh we turn to HB 314 FN
 
00:57:37.730 --> 00:57:37.740 align:start position:0%
um relative to the expectation of
 
00:57:39.349 --> 00:57:39.359 align:start position:0%
privacy in the collection and use of
 
00:57:40.970 --> 00:57:40.980 align:start position:0%
personal information
 
00:57:42.710 --> 00:57:42.720 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to recommend I'm going to
 
00:57:47.150 --> 00:57:47.160 align:start position:0%
recognize myself and uh with a motion to
 
00:57:47.160 --> 00:57:48.470 align:start position:0%
recognize myself and uh with a motion to
retain

00:57:48.470 --> 00:57:48.480 align:start position:0%
retain
 
00:57:50.390 --> 00:57:50.400 align:start position:0%
is there a second I'll second atmosphere
 
00:57:52.309 --> 00:57:52.319 align:start position:0%
all right motion's been made in second
 
00:57:55.370 --> 00:57:55.380 align:start position:0%
and let me um explain
 
00:57:58.069 --> 00:57:58.079 align:start position:0%
um the basis of this motion
 
00:57:58.079 --> 00:58:00.349 align:start position:0%
um the basis of this motion
um

00:58:00.349 --> 00:58:00.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:02.690 --> 00:58:02.700 align:start position:0%
I think this is really an important bill
 
00:58:06.230 --> 00:58:06.240 align:start position:0%
and I I really want to recognize
 
00:58:09.049 --> 00:58:09.059 align:start position:0%
representative erf uh for his work on
 
00:58:12.170 --> 00:58:12.180 align:start position:0%
this he's done a lot of work on it
 
00:58:15.290 --> 00:58:15.300 align:start position:0%
um and I I I've tried to work I work
 
00:58:17.990 --> 00:58:18.000 align:start position:0%
with him on on this and
 
00:58:20.210 --> 00:58:20.220 align:start position:0%
um I had proposed which I think you've
 
00:58:22.670 --> 00:58:22.680 align:start position:0%
seen I've proposed an amendment which I
 
00:58:25.370 --> 00:58:25.380 align:start position:0%
know he and I disagreed on
 
00:58:27.109 --> 00:58:27.119 align:start position:0%
um I thought it was necessary to sort of
 
00:58:27.119 --> 00:58:28.910 align:start position:0%
um I thought it was necessary to sort of
to

00:58:28.910 --> 00:58:28.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:58:28.920 --> 00:58:30.950 align:start position:0%
to
um

00:58:30.950 --> 00:58:30.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:34.790 --> 00:58:34.800 align:start position:0%
restrict the potential reach of the bill
 
00:58:34.800 --> 00:58:35.809 align:start position:0%
restrict the potential reach of the bill
um

00:58:35.809 --> 00:58:35.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:38.270 --> 00:58:38.280 align:start position:0%
but after discussions with him and after
 
00:58:41.650 --> 00:58:41.660 align:start position:0%
discussions with the former uh
 
00:58:45.609 --> 00:58:45.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:48.530 --> 00:58:48.540 align:start position:0%
Kirk from sorry thank you former
 
00:58:51.589 --> 00:58:51.599 align:start position:0%
representative Kirk from where
 
00:58:54.950 --> 00:58:54.960 align:start position:0%
I think that there are I I hope that we
 
00:58:56.750 --> 00:58:56.760 align:start position:0%
will be able to move forward with this
 
00:58:59.089 --> 00:58:59.099 align:start position:0%
legislation and hopefully in a
 
00:59:00.650 --> 00:59:00.660 align:start position:0%
bipartisan way
 
00:59:04.250 --> 00:59:04.260 align:start position:0%
um next uh session but I think there are
 
00:59:04.260 --> 00:59:05.710 align:start position:0%
um next uh session but I think there are
issues

00:59:05.710 --> 00:59:05.720 align:start position:0%
issues
 
00:59:09.109 --> 00:59:09.119 align:start position:0%
that need to be resolved and it needs to
 
00:59:09.119 --> 00:59:09.829 align:start position:0%
that need to be resolved and it needs to
be

00:59:09.829 --> 00:59:09.839 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:59:14.930 --> 00:59:14.940 align:start position:0%
tightened up uh more than more than uh
 
00:59:16.849 --> 00:59:16.859 align:start position:0%
it is right now for I mean for example
 
00:59:18.309 --> 00:59:18.319 align:start position:0%
one of the
 
00:59:20.710 --> 00:59:20.720 align:start position:0%
one of the big
 
00:59:24.230 --> 00:59:24.240 align:start position:0%
issues that um that representative erf
 
00:59:26.210 --> 00:59:26.220 align:start position:0%
and I talked about and I think we may
 
00:59:27.650 --> 00:59:27.660 align:start position:0%
have talked about a little may have been
 
00:59:31.430 --> 00:59:31.440 align:start position:0%
raised a little bit at the hearing is
 
00:59:31.440 --> 00:59:33.069 align:start position:0%
raised a little bit at the hearing is
it's

00:59:33.069 --> 00:59:33.079 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:59:35.270 --> 00:59:35.280 align:start position:0%
one thing
 
00:59:37.549 --> 00:59:37.559 align:start position:0%
um to to restrict
 
00:59:40.849 --> 00:59:40.859 align:start position:0%
the government's ability to
 
00:59:43.670 --> 00:59:43.680 align:start position:0%
get and maybe release to other people
 
00:59:45.710 --> 00:59:45.720 align:start position:0%
private information
 
00:59:48.109 --> 00:59:48.119 align:start position:0%
it's another thing if you're talking
 
00:59:48.119 --> 00:59:49.309 align:start position:0%
it's another thing if you're talking
about

00:59:49.309 --> 00:59:49.319 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:59:49.319 --> 00:59:50.809 align:start position:0%
about
private

00:59:50.809 --> 00:59:50.819 align:start position:0%
private
 
00:59:56.569 --> 00:59:56.579 align:start position:0%
to Res to create a uh right of privacy
 
00:59:59.270 --> 00:59:59.280 align:start position:0%
in our information when it's in the
 
01:00:01.370 --> 01:00:01.380 align:start position:0%
hands of a third party that's not the
 
01:00:01.380 --> 01:00:02.930 align:start position:0%
hands of a third party that's not the
government

01:00:02.930 --> 01:00:02.940 align:start position:0%
government
 
01:00:05.750 --> 01:00:05.760 align:start position:0%
um and what the potential implications
 
01:00:08.690 --> 01:00:08.700 align:start position:0%
of that could be uh to Industry I mean
 
01:00:10.910 --> 01:00:10.920 align:start position:0%
we heard some people testify about their
 
01:00:12.349 --> 01:00:12.359 align:start position:0%
real concerns about what the
 
01:00:13.730 --> 01:00:13.740 align:start position:0%
implications of that would be for
 
01:00:16.490 --> 01:00:16.500 align:start position:0%
industry but let me let me just draw it
 
01:00:18.170 --> 01:00:18.180 align:start position:0%
I think that's what this there was
 
01:00:20.030 --> 01:00:20.040 align:start position:0%
reference made to this at the hearing I
 
01:00:22.430 --> 01:00:22.440 align:start position:0%
believe let me just draw this this uh
 
01:00:26.270 --> 01:00:26.280 align:start position:0%
this analogy or not maybe which may not
 
01:00:27.970 --> 01:00:27.980 align:start position:0%
be great but I think it makes the point
 
01:00:30.890 --> 01:00:30.900 align:start position:0%
the in New Hampshire the New Hampshire
 
01:00:32.569 --> 01:00:32.579 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court has held that there's an
 
01:00:36.109 --> 01:00:36.119 align:start position:0%
expectation of privacy in your trash so
 
01:00:38.089 --> 01:00:38.099 align:start position:0%
if you you know fill up your trash bag
 
01:00:40.490 --> 01:00:40.500 align:start position:0%
you put it out at the curb
 
01:00:43.309 --> 01:00:43.319 align:start position:0%
um the government the police cannot just
 
01:00:46.910 --> 01:00:46.920 align:start position:0%
go and open up you know go up go
 
01:00:48.349 --> 01:00:48.359 align:start position:0%
sniffing through your trash bag and say
 
01:00:50.030 --> 01:00:50.040 align:start position:0%
ah look what we found here you know I
 
01:00:53.089 --> 01:00:53.099 align:start position:0%
there's uh something this is my drug
 
01:00:54.950 --> 01:00:54.960 align:start position:0%
proceeds Ledger or whatever they they
 
01:00:56.270 --> 01:00:56.280 align:start position:0%
can't do that they got to get a warrant
 
01:00:58.849 --> 01:00:58.859 align:start position:0%
if they want to do but
 
01:01:01.970 --> 01:01:01.980 align:start position:0%
that doesn't mean that if you're the
 
01:01:05.210 --> 01:01:05.220 align:start position:0%
neighbor of the person or you're you
 
01:01:06.490 --> 01:01:06.500 align:start position:0%
know uh
 
01:01:08.870 --> 01:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
a homeless person that happens to be
 
01:01:11.690 --> 01:01:11.700 align:start position:0%
walking by down the street that you
 
01:01:13.730 --> 01:01:13.740 align:start position:0%
can't open up that bag and if you did
 
01:01:16.490 --> 01:01:16.500 align:start position:0%
that you that you could be held liable
 
01:01:18.170 --> 01:01:18.180 align:start position:0%
there's no law that I'm aware of that
 
01:01:21.470 --> 01:01:21.480 align:start position:0%
would say that you know that if if that
 
01:01:23.390 --> 01:01:23.400 align:start position:0%
happened your neighbor comes in and
 
01:01:25.789 --> 01:01:25.799 align:start position:0%
opens up the uh opens up something that
 
01:01:27.589 --> 01:01:27.599 align:start position:0%
you've put out in the trash that you can
 
01:01:30.650 --> 01:01:30.660 align:start position:0%
sue your neighbor and and collect
 
01:01:32.690 --> 01:01:32.700 align:start position:0%
um and get an injunction or collect
 
01:01:33.910 --> 01:01:33.920 align:start position:0%
damage or something like that I mean
 
01:01:37.309 --> 01:01:37.319 align:start position:0%
that certainly that if that were if if
 
01:01:38.870 --> 01:01:38.880 align:start position:0%
you could do that it certainly wouldn't
 
01:01:41.410 --> 01:01:41.420 align:start position:0%
be based on any kind of constitutional
 
01:01:44.510 --> 01:01:44.520 align:start position:0%
provision uh and so I think we I think I
 
01:01:45.890 --> 01:01:45.900 align:start position:0%
guess what I'm really saying is we need
 
01:01:48.470 --> 01:01:48.480 align:start position:0%
to think really carefully about this I
 
01:01:51.170 --> 01:01:51.180 align:start position:0%
hope we'll have more time to do that
 
01:01:53.450 --> 01:01:53.460 align:start position:0%
um over the over the summer and and be
 
01:01:56.450 --> 01:01:56.460 align:start position:0%
able to come back with uh with uh
 
01:01:58.670 --> 01:01:58.680 align:start position:0%
with a bill that will be
 
01:02:01.549 --> 01:02:01.559 align:start position:0%
Tighter and will be able to to draw
 
01:02:03.470 --> 01:02:03.480 align:start position:0%
bipartisan support because I think that
 
01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:04.490 align:start position:0%
bipartisan support because I think that
that

01:02:04.490 --> 01:02:04.500 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:02:06.530 --> 01:02:06.540 align:start position:0%
an interesting I mean I think we all
 
01:02:09.049 --> 01:02:09.059 align:start position:0%
have an interest in protecting privacy
 
01:02:10.010 --> 01:02:10.020 align:start position:0%
um so that's all I have to say
 
01:02:11.630 --> 01:02:11.640 align:start position:0%
representative Smith
 
01:02:13.190 --> 01:02:13.200 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:02:15.410 --> 01:02:15.420 align:start position:0%
um Mr chairman um
 
01:02:18.470 --> 01:02:18.480 align:start position:0%
I don't think we all have an interest in
 
01:02:21.530 --> 01:02:21.540 align:start position:0%
protecting privacy so I'm sorry to
 
01:02:24.710 --> 01:02:24.720 align:start position:0%
disagree with you on that I have an
 
01:02:27.289 --> 01:02:27.299 align:start position:0%
interest in protecting privacy and I
 
01:02:30.710 --> 01:02:30.720 align:start position:0%
think many others do because we are
 
01:02:33.589 --> 01:02:33.599 align:start position:0%
going to retain this spill I don't feel
 
01:02:35.870 --> 01:02:35.880 align:start position:0%
the need to go through all my reasons
 
01:02:38.510 --> 01:02:38.520 align:start position:0%
why I think this is a very important
 
01:02:42.170 --> 01:02:42.180 align:start position:0%
bill I think we are a state that has had
 
01:02:47.030 --> 01:02:47.040 align:start position:0%
a long tradition of being libertarian in
 
01:02:50.870 --> 01:02:50.880 align:start position:0%
terms of keeping the government out of
 
01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:52.750 align:start position:0%
terms of keeping the government out of
private

01:02:52.750 --> 01:02:52.760 align:start position:0%
private
 
01:02:55.130 --> 01:02:55.140 align:start position:0%
private business and I feel very
 
01:02:57.890 --> 01:02:57.900 align:start position:0%
strongly about that I strongly I support
 
01:03:01.190 --> 01:03:01.200 align:start position:0%
your recommendation of retain and hope
 
01:03:04.010 --> 01:03:04.020 align:start position:0%
we will have some detailed conversations
 
01:03:06.589 --> 01:03:06.599 align:start position:0%
about this in the next few months so
 
01:03:09.230 --> 01:03:09.240 align:start position:0%
that we can end up with a strong bill
 
01:03:12.530 --> 01:03:12.540 align:start position:0%
that could pass the house overwhelmingly
 
01:03:13.849 --> 01:03:13.859 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:03:15.950 --> 01:03:15.960 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to yes representative
 
01:03:18.410 --> 01:03:18.420 align:start position:0%
Alexander thank you Mr chair and and I
 
01:03:20.390 --> 01:03:20.400 align:start position:0%
would like to Echo my friend from Durham
 
01:03:22.730 --> 01:03:22.740 align:start position:0%
I think she's entirely correct uh we
 
01:03:25.789 --> 01:03:25.799 align:start position:0%
worked um last term on
 
01:03:27.470 --> 01:03:27.480 align:start position:0%
um a bill in a work session I'd like to
 
01:03:29.030 --> 01:03:29.040 align:start position:0%
continue that tradition to try to make
 
01:03:31.130 --> 01:03:31.140 align:start position:0%
this the best Bill possible
 
01:03:33.950 --> 01:03:33.960 align:start position:0%
um my concerns with this bill as is
 
01:03:35.510 --> 01:03:35.520 align:start position:0%
um is
 
01:03:37.250 --> 01:03:37.260 align:start position:0%
an individual shall have a reasonable
 
01:03:38.630 --> 01:03:38.640 align:start position:0%
expectation of privacy and personal
 
01:03:41.210 --> 01:03:41.220 align:start position:0%
information I see that as private
 
01:03:43.670 --> 01:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
entities made the argument that
 
01:03:45.530 --> 01:03:45.540 align:start position:0%
um there was no distinction between
 
01:03:47.569 --> 01:03:47.579 align:start position:0%
private and public even though later in
 
01:03:49.250 --> 01:03:49.260 align:start position:0%
the bill it did concede that it's only
 
01:03:53.510 --> 01:03:53.520 align:start position:0%
public information in 507 H3 line 26 27
 
01:03:56.750 --> 01:03:56.760 align:start position:0%
page two and the other concern I have is
 
01:03:59.870 --> 01:03:59.880 align:start position:0%
when a public entity shares private
 
01:04:01.849 --> 01:04:01.859 align:start position:0%
information there's no standard of
 
01:04:03.230 --> 01:04:03.240 align:start position:0%
negligence and I'd like to see that
 
01:04:05.150 --> 01:04:05.160 align:start position:0%
negligent standard in the bill in some
 
01:04:07.130 --> 01:04:07.140 align:start position:0%
way so with that I absolutely would like
 
01:04:09.109 --> 01:04:09.119 align:start position:0%
to retain this and I'm happy to spend
 
01:04:11.510 --> 01:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
the summer months with um representative
 
01:04:13.789 --> 01:04:13.799 align:start position:0%
Smith and hopefully work on this thanks
 
01:04:15.789 --> 01:04:15.799 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to speak
 
01:04:17.809 --> 01:04:17.819 align:start position:0%
that's a very good point representative
 
01:04:19.430 --> 01:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
Alexander the the standard the
 
01:04:21.349 --> 01:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
culpability standard they're they're I
 
01:04:22.910 --> 01:04:22.920 align:start position:0%
think that's that's something that was
 
01:04:24.829 --> 01:04:24.839 align:start position:0%
missing and and I'm glad you pointed
 
01:04:26.690 --> 01:04:26.700 align:start position:0%
that out all right um so we're ready for
 
01:04:32.390 --> 01:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
a vote all right so on uh HB 314 FN uh
 
01:04:34.730 --> 01:04:34.740 align:start position:0%
the the motion on the floor is to retain
 
01:04:37.069 --> 01:04:37.079 align:start position:0%
and I'd ask the clerk to call the roll
 
01:04:37.079 --> 01:04:38.809 align:start position:0%
and I'd ask the clerk to call the roll
please

01:04:38.809 --> 01:04:38.819 align:start position:0%

01:05:29.510 --> 01:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
and so I you know I should say I um one
 
01:05:32.150 --> 01:05:32.160 align:start position:0%
thing I I I learned yesterday that I
 
01:05:33.890 --> 01:05:33.900 align:start position:0%
didn't I didn't realize is when we
 
01:05:36.829 --> 01:05:36.839 align:start position:0%
retain a bill it doesn't go on the
 
01:05:36.839 --> 01:05:38.150 align:start position:0%
retain a bill it doesn't go on the
calendar

01:05:38.150 --> 01:05:38.160 align:start position:0%
calendar
 
01:05:40.430 --> 01:05:40.440 align:start position:0%
um because it's it's state what it means
 
01:05:42.589 --> 01:05:42.599 align:start position:0%
is it stays in committee so we'll have
 
01:05:42.599 --> 01:05:43.370 align:start position:0%
is it stays in committee so we'll have
it

01:05:43.370 --> 01:05:43.380 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:05:45.589 --> 01:05:45.599 align:start position:0%
um we'll have to uh we'll have a meeting
 
01:05:47.750 --> 01:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
in the fall we'll have to decide you
 
01:05:48.950 --> 01:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
know what we want to what
 
01:05:50.390 --> 01:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
recommendations we might make for
 
01:05:52.849 --> 01:05:52.859 align:start position:0%
legislation for next term but it doesn't
 
01:05:54.770 --> 01:05:54.780 align:start position:0%
go on the calendar for when it's a
 
01:05:54.780 --> 01:05:56.270 align:start position:0%
go on the calendar for when it's a
retained

01:05:56.270 --> 01:05:56.280 align:start position:0%
retained
 
01:05:56.280 --> 01:05:57.049 align:start position:0%
retained
um

01:05:57.049 --> 01:05:57.059 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:58.309 --> 01:05:58.319 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:06:00.170 --> 01:06:00.180 align:start position:0%
um and I I didn't know that until uh
 
01:06:02.150 --> 01:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
until yesterday
 
01:06:06.230 --> 01:06:06.240 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to turn to HB 149 FN
 
01:06:10.370 --> 01:06:10.380 align:start position:0%
relative I'm sorry yeah no no
 
01:06:13.370 --> 01:06:13.380 align:start position:0%
I'd like to make a motion on this oh uh
 
01:06:15.530 --> 01:06:15.540 align:start position:0%
okay hang on one second relative to
 
01:06:17.089 --> 01:06:17.099 align:start position:0%
handling of requests made under the
 
01:06:20.450 --> 01:06:20.460 align:start position:0%
right so no law and I would recognize
 
01:06:22.430 --> 01:06:22.440 align:start position:0%
first representative Alexander for a
 
01:06:25.370 --> 01:06:25.380 align:start position:0%
motion thank you Mr chair I moved to
 
01:06:27.829 --> 01:06:27.839 align:start position:0%
retain HP 149.
 
01:06:31.309 --> 01:06:31.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:33.770 --> 01:06:33.780 align:start position:0%
I'll second it right would you like to
 
01:06:35.029 --> 01:06:35.039 align:start position:0%
speak to that uh representative
 
01:06:37.670 --> 01:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
Alexander yes obviously uh uh have
 
01:06:39.829 --> 01:06:39.839 align:start position:0%
representative Smith speak yes Mr chair
 
01:06:42.829 --> 01:06:42.839 align:start position:0%
and and I I don't want to speak for
 
01:06:45.349 --> 01:06:45.359 align:start position:0%
representative Smith I think I I
 
01:06:47.270 --> 01:06:47.280 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly support this bill I think
 
01:06:49.309 --> 01:06:49.319 align:start position:0%
it's a great bill I think it's important
 
01:06:51.230 --> 01:06:51.240 align:start position:0%
that we put reasonable timelines on
 
01:06:53.210 --> 01:06:53.220 align:start position:0%
government entities for right to no
 
01:06:54.890 --> 01:06:54.900 align:start position:0%
requests I think this is a completely
 
01:06:56.270 --> 01:06:56.280 align:start position:0%
reasonable Bill and a reasonable
 
01:06:56.280 --> 01:06:57.349 align:start position:0%
reasonable Bill and a reasonable
timeline

01:06:57.349 --> 01:06:57.359 align:start position:0%
timeline
 
01:07:00.349 --> 01:07:00.359 align:start position:0%
the concern I have is that we just
 
01:07:02.390 --> 01:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
recently this committee supported a
 
01:07:04.609 --> 01:07:04.619 align:start position:0%
right to no one budsman who took office
 
01:07:07.970 --> 01:07:07.980 align:start position:0%
I believe this week or last week we
 
01:07:09.589 --> 01:07:09.599 align:start position:0%
haven't seen the rulings of the
 
01:07:11.089 --> 01:07:11.099 align:start position:0%
Ombudsman I think it's a very valuable
 
01:07:13.789 --> 01:07:13.799 align:start position:0%
position much needed but I think that a
 
01:07:15.650 --> 01:07:15.660 align:start position:0%
lot of the things in this bill
 
01:07:17.750 --> 01:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
can be solved by the Ombudsman so I
 
01:07:19.010 --> 01:07:19.020 align:start position:0%
think the thing that we should think
 
01:07:21.710 --> 01:07:21.720 align:start position:0%
about is time and give the Ombudsman
 
01:07:23.270 --> 01:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
time and if the Ombudsman hasn't
 
01:07:24.650 --> 01:07:24.660 align:start position:0%
addressed it by the time we deal with
 
01:07:26.630 --> 01:07:26.640 align:start position:0%
this in November I would be willing to
 
01:07:28.130 --> 01:07:28.140 align:start position:0%
sit down with representative Smith and
 
01:07:30.470 --> 01:07:30.480 align:start position:0%
hopefully we can amend our past bill as
 
01:07:31.910 --> 01:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
is thanks
 
01:07:33.650 --> 01:07:33.660 align:start position:0%
representative Smith
 
01:07:37.430 --> 01:07:37.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr uh chair
 
01:07:41.870 --> 01:07:41.880 align:start position:0%
um I I apologize for trying to make the
 
01:07:44.210 --> 01:07:44.220 align:start position:0%
motion but since it was my bill I
 
01:07:45.470 --> 01:07:45.480 align:start position:0%
thought that
 
01:07:49.430 --> 01:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
I might get the first stab at it uh
 
01:07:51.529 --> 01:07:51.539 align:start position:0%
nonetheless you're the chair and I
 
01:07:53.529 --> 01:07:53.539 align:start position:0%
support what you did
 
01:07:57.170 --> 01:07:57.180 align:start position:0%
and as you all know I have great regard
 
01:08:00.470 --> 01:08:00.480 align:start position:0%
for my colleague from Goffstown
 
01:08:04.970 --> 01:08:04.980 align:start position:0%
um but with all due regard and respect
 
01:08:08.150 --> 01:08:08.160 align:start position:0%
and all those positive words there is
 
01:08:11.710 --> 01:08:11.720 align:start position:0%
nothing in this bill
 
01:08:16.130 --> 01:08:16.140 align:start position:0%
that is immediately relevant to the
 
01:08:19.610 --> 01:08:19.620 align:start position:0%
Ombudsman in fact a co-sponsor on this
 
01:08:22.189 --> 01:08:22.199 align:start position:0%
bill is the person who played the
 
01:08:24.110 --> 01:08:24.120 align:start position:0%
greatest role in this legislature in
 
01:08:26.930 --> 01:08:26.940 align:start position:0%
getting in Ombudsman and still felt that
 
01:08:29.329 --> 01:08:29.339 align:start position:0%
this bill was necessary and that of
 
01:08:31.729 --> 01:08:31.739 align:start position:0%
course is our colleague from Newmarket
 
01:08:35.510 --> 01:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
we have seen again and again and again
 
01:08:40.610 --> 01:08:40.620 align:start position:0%
and we have seen no indication
 
01:08:42.769 --> 01:08:42.779 align:start position:0%
um of changing the minds of those people
 
01:08:45.650 --> 01:08:45.660 align:start position:0%
who are resistant to the concept of
 
01:08:46.849 --> 01:08:46.859 align:start position:0%
right to know
 
01:08:49.910 --> 01:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
uh we have seen no change in their
 
01:08:52.370 --> 01:08:52.380 align:start position:0%
attitude that they can take as long as
 
01:08:55.010 --> 01:08:55.020 align:start position:0%
they would like and prolong as long as
 
01:08:58.130 --> 01:08:58.140 align:start position:0%
they would like their response all this
 
01:09:01.249 --> 01:09:01.259 align:start position:0%
bill says is okay if you want to take a
 
01:09:02.809 --> 01:09:02.819 align:start position:0%
long time to respond
 
01:09:07.189 --> 01:09:07.199 align:start position:0%
fine but you must tell
 
01:09:07.199 --> 01:09:07.789 align:start position:0%
fine but you must tell
um

01:09:07.789 --> 01:09:07.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:07.799 --> 01:09:09.229 align:start position:0%
um
uh

01:09:09.229 --> 01:09:09.239 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:09:11.990 --> 01:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
you must tell the complainant that's not
 
01:09:13.430 --> 01:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
quite the right word what's my right
 
01:09:14.470 --> 01:09:14.480 align:start position:0%
word right
 
01:09:18.530 --> 01:09:18.540 align:start position:0%
how long it's going to be and if every
 
01:09:21.169 --> 01:09:21.179 align:start position:0%
30 days you have to say well yes this is
 
01:09:24.110 --> 01:09:24.120 align:start position:0%
the this is the progress I've made or we
 
01:09:25.970 --> 01:09:25.980 align:start position:0%
haven't made any progress and this is
 
01:09:28.849 --> 01:09:28.859 align:start position:0%
why you can go on and on and on and on
 
01:09:31.669 --> 01:09:31.679 align:start position:0%
but at least you have a responsibility
 
01:09:35.930 --> 01:09:35.940 align:start position:0%
to the public to tell the public why you
 
01:09:40.610 --> 01:09:40.620 align:start position:0%
haven't yet complied with the laws of of
 
01:09:43.789 --> 01:09:43.799 align:start position:0%
right to know and so I think that we can
 
01:09:45.229 --> 01:09:45.239 align:start position:0%
delay this
 
01:09:47.870 --> 01:09:47.880 align:start position:0%
we can retain it but that means all
 
01:09:50.809 --> 01:09:50.819 align:start position:0%
those people who have filed right to
 
01:09:52.669 --> 01:09:52.679 align:start position:0%
know requests and are not getting
 
01:09:55.250 --> 01:09:55.260 align:start position:0%
responses from some public agencies
 
01:09:56.990 --> 01:09:57.000 align:start position:0%
there are many public agencies that do
 
01:09:58.250 --> 01:09:58.260 align:start position:0%
the right thing but there's some that
 
01:09:58.260 --> 01:09:59.090 align:start position:0%
the right thing but there's some that
don't

01:09:59.090 --> 01:09:59.100 align:start position:0%
don't
 
01:10:01.729 --> 01:10:01.739 align:start position:0%
and um meanwhile they're not going to
 
01:10:04.970 --> 01:10:04.980 align:start position:0%
get help and I would hope the committee
 
01:10:07.610 --> 01:10:07.620 align:start position:0%
um in due course would vote down retain
 
01:10:10.130 --> 01:10:10.140 align:start position:0%
and would entertain
 
01:10:12.770 --> 01:10:12.780 align:start position:0%
um and not to pass motion thank you all
 
01:10:15.350 --> 01:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
right yes representative greeson thank
 
01:10:17.810 --> 01:10:17.820 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair uh I think everybody's in
 
01:10:20.090 --> 01:10:20.100 align:start position:0%
agreement that we need to address the
 
01:10:21.830 --> 01:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
issue of government entities not
 
01:10:23.930 --> 01:10:23.940 align:start position:0%
providing the records that are requested
 
01:10:26.510 --> 01:10:26.520 align:start position:0%
and doing it in a timely manner one of
 
01:10:28.490 --> 01:10:28.500 align:start position:0%
the issues I found in this particular
 
01:10:30.470 --> 01:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
bill is that there's no actual
 
01:10:33.770 --> 01:10:33.780 align:start position:0%
requirement to provide any records you
 
01:10:35.630 --> 01:10:35.640 align:start position:0%
can delay it 30 days you can delay it 30
 
01:10:37.250 --> 01:10:37.260 align:start position:0%
days you could delay it 30 days as long
 
01:10:38.510 --> 01:10:38.520 align:start position:0%
as I tell you I'm going to delay it 30
 
01:10:42.410 --> 01:10:42.420 align:start position:0%
days I get 30 more days and so uh I I
 
01:10:44.870 --> 01:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
would actually like to see this bill
 
01:10:47.870 --> 01:10:47.880 align:start position:0%
modified to say not to exceed 90 days or
 
01:10:50.510 --> 01:10:50.520 align:start position:0%
some some deadline and then if you can't
 
01:10:53.030 --> 01:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
meet that then there's some other course
 
01:10:55.010 --> 01:10:55.020 align:start position:0%
of action either take it to the judge or
 
01:10:56.450 --> 01:10:56.460 align:start position:0%
take it to the Ombudsman whatever the
 
01:10:58.490 --> 01:10:58.500 align:start position:0%
case may be but the fact that there's no
 
01:11:00.110 --> 01:11:00.120 align:start position:0%
actual requirement to produce the
 
01:11:02.450 --> 01:11:02.460 align:start position:0%
records or there's no set deadline by
 
01:11:04.610 --> 01:11:04.620 align:start position:0%
which the records are are actually going
 
01:11:06.830 --> 01:11:06.840 align:start position:0%
to be provided I see that there being an
 
01:11:09.169 --> 01:11:09.179 align:start position:0%
issue with the current bill in its
 
01:11:11.450 --> 01:11:11.460 align:start position:0%
current state
 
01:11:14.209 --> 01:11:14.219 align:start position:0%
other anyone else that wishes to uh yes
 
01:11:16.550 --> 01:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
representative Andrews thank you Mr
 
01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:17.630 align:start position:0%
representative Andrews thank you Mr
chair

01:11:17.630 --> 01:11:17.640 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:11:19.970 --> 01:11:19.980 align:start position:0%
I think the bill needs a little more
 
01:11:22.850 --> 01:11:22.860 align:start position:0%
work on it there has to be a time frame
 
01:11:26.510 --> 01:11:26.520 align:start position:0%
in the last nine years I have dealt with
 
01:11:28.850 --> 01:11:28.860 align:start position:0%
my school district asking for
 
01:11:31.729 --> 01:11:31.739 align:start position:0%
information off and on and unless a
 
01:11:33.410 --> 01:11:33.420 align:start position:0%
person asks
 
01:11:35.630 --> 01:11:35.640 align:start position:0%
for something extensive that's really
 
01:11:37.790 --> 01:11:37.800 align:start position:0%
going to take a lot of research there's
 
01:11:39.709 --> 01:11:39.719 align:start position:0%
no reason
 
01:11:42.590 --> 01:11:42.600 align:start position:0%
to keep going well I can't have it in 30
 
01:11:44.870 --> 01:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
days and in the end of 30 days well I
 
01:11:47.810 --> 01:11:47.820 align:start position:0%
got to have another 30 days because I
 
01:11:51.890 --> 01:11:51.900 align:start position:0%
think as a disservice to the public and
 
01:11:54.169 --> 01:11:54.179 align:start position:0%
I would in this bill I would really love
 
01:11:56.870 --> 01:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
to see some kind of reasonable time
 
01:11:59.810 --> 01:11:59.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:02.689 --> 01:12:02.699 align:start position:0%
anyone yes representative tur
 
01:12:04.729 --> 01:12:04.739 align:start position:0%
yeah just coming at it from a different
 
01:12:07.010 --> 01:12:07.020 align:start position:0%
perspective but
 
01:12:09.590 --> 01:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
um I think a reason to move it forward
 
01:12:11.330 --> 01:12:11.340 align:start position:0%
as it is
 
01:12:13.310 --> 01:12:13.320 align:start position:0%
um is almost the opposite of sort of the
 
01:12:15.950 --> 01:12:15.960 align:start position:0%
issues of of stonewalling by local
 
01:12:18.950 --> 01:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
municipalities I think the idea of
 
01:12:21.530 --> 01:12:21.540 align:start position:0%
reporting on the progress and Reporting
 
01:12:23.630 --> 01:12:23.640 align:start position:0%
on the work that's going on in order to
 
01:12:25.189 --> 01:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
fill some of these requests and I'm
 
01:12:26.570 --> 01:12:26.580 align:start position:0%
picking up on what representative
 
01:12:29.090 --> 01:12:29.100 align:start position:0%
Stapleton said during the hearing you
 
01:12:32.330 --> 01:12:32.340 align:start position:0%
know that there is also you know people
 
01:12:35.149 --> 01:12:35.159 align:start position:0%
who put in very broad right to know
 
01:12:37.430 --> 01:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
requests that require a lot of time and
 
01:12:39.229 --> 01:12:39.239 align:start position:0%
legal review
 
01:12:41.689 --> 01:12:41.699 align:start position:0%
um in order to fulfill and I feel like
 
01:12:45.290 --> 01:12:45.300 align:start position:0%
this might help elicit or or shine a
 
01:12:47.149 --> 01:12:47.159 align:start position:0%
light on the amount of effort that does
 
01:12:49.189 --> 01:12:49.199 align:start position:0%
go into some of these so that's why I
 
01:12:50.930 --> 01:12:50.940 align:start position:0%
would support it
 
01:12:53.990 --> 01:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to be heard regarding
 
01:12:57.649 --> 01:12:57.659 align:start position:0%

01:14:14.870 --> 01:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:14:14.880 --> 01:14:18.530 align:start position:0%
all right
um right

01:14:18.530 --> 01:14:18.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:21.290 --> 01:14:21.300 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to uh
 
01:14:25.189 --> 01:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna turn I'm gonna I'm gonna pass
 
01:14:29.030 --> 01:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
on Passover 289 for the mo I have 254 at
 
01:14:32.590 --> 01:14:32.600 align:start position:0%
the moment and turn to uh House Bill 289
 
01:14:36.470 --> 01:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
uh relative to consultation with legal
 
01:14:39.410 --> 01:14:39.420 align:start position:0%
counsel under the right to know off and
 
01:14:42.310 --> 01:14:42.320 align:start position:0%
I'm going to recognize uh myself
 
01:14:47.990 --> 01:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
uh uh and move uh itl on that bill and
 
01:14:50.810 --> 01:14:50.820 align:start position:0%
ask if there's a second there is
 
01:14:55.070 --> 01:14:55.080 align:start position:0%
motion has been made and seconded um and
 
01:14:57.530 --> 01:14:57.540 align:start position:0%
give me just one second while I turn to
 
01:15:10.850 --> 01:15:10.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:14.590 --> 01:15:14.600 align:start position:0%
so I basically my my
 
01:15:18.229 --> 01:15:18.239 align:start position:0%
reason for uh wanting to itl this bill
 
01:15:20.149 --> 01:15:20.159 align:start position:0%
is I just think it is really completely
 
01:15:20.159 --> 01:15:22.070 align:start position:0%
is I just think it is really completely
unnecessary

01:15:22.070 --> 01:15:22.080 align:start position:0%
unnecessary
 
01:15:26.510 --> 01:15:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:32.870 --> 01:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:35.209 --> 01:15:35.219 align:start position:0%
yeah no that's all right no problem so
 
01:15:37.850 --> 01:15:37.860 align:start position:0%
the reason I um I believe that that uh
 
01:15:40.370 --> 01:15:40.380 align:start position:0%
itl in this bill uh is appropriate is
 
01:15:42.470 --> 01:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
that I just don't think this bill is
 
01:15:42.480 --> 01:15:44.090 align:start position:0%
that I just don't think this bill is
necessary

01:15:44.090 --> 01:15:44.100 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
01:15:46.490 --> 01:15:46.500 align:start position:0%
um it suggests that
 
01:15:48.770 --> 01:15:48.780 align:start position:0%
um we should have a we should add a
 
01:15:52.970 --> 01:15:52.980 align:start position:0%
Proviso to the provision that allows
 
01:15:52.980 --> 01:15:54.350 align:start position:0%
Proviso to the provision that allows
um uh

01:15:54.350 --> 01:15:54.360 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
01:15:56.330 --> 01:15:56.340 align:start position:0%
I I
 
01:15:56.340 --> 01:15:57.110 align:start position:0%
I I
um

01:15:57.110 --> 01:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:01.070 --> 01:16:01.080 align:start position:0%
there to be a a non-public session
 
01:16:04.310 --> 01:16:04.320 align:start position:0%
um to consult with Council
 
01:16:06.169 --> 01:16:06.179 align:start position:0%
um it goes on to say to provide under no
 
01:16:08.450 --> 01:16:08.460 align:start position:0%
circumstances shall a member of a public
 
01:16:11.390 --> 01:16:11.400 align:start position:0%
body retain or consult with Council for
 
01:16:13.490 --> 01:16:13.500 align:start position:0%
the purpose of evading compliance with
 
01:16:16.370 --> 01:16:16.380 align:start position:0%
this chapter and then creates a criminal
 
01:16:19.550 --> 01:16:19.560 align:start position:0%
penalty it
 
01:16:23.390 --> 01:16:23.400 align:start position:0%
I it it just seems to me that this is is
 
01:16:25.970 --> 01:16:25.980 align:start position:0%
a solution in search of a problem
 
01:16:28.370 --> 01:16:28.380 align:start position:0%
um if an if if an if an attorney were to
 
01:16:31.130 --> 01:16:31.140 align:start position:0%
do that now
 
01:16:33.470 --> 01:16:33.480 align:start position:0%
um they the attorney would be subject to
 
01:16:35.630 --> 01:16:35.640 align:start position:0%
uh I mean assuming it could be proved
 
01:16:37.750 --> 01:16:37.760 align:start position:0%
and of course that would be the the
 
01:16:40.729 --> 01:16:40.739 align:start position:0%
proving that that somehow a consultation
 
01:16:42.470 --> 01:16:42.480 align:start position:0%
with Council was not really for a
 
01:16:44.689 --> 01:16:44.699 align:start position:0%
legitimate purpose would be
 
01:16:46.550 --> 01:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
um I think would be something of a
 
01:16:49.189 --> 01:16:49.199 align:start position:0%
Fool's errand but but even it but if but
 
01:16:51.649 --> 01:16:51.659 align:start position:0%
if that could could happen then the
 
01:16:53.810 --> 01:16:53.820 align:start position:0%
lawyer and the lawyer Were Somehow to
 
01:16:55.370 --> 01:16:55.380 align:start position:0%
participate in that I think the lawyer
 
01:16:57.110 --> 01:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
would already be subject to disciplinary
 
01:16:59.570 --> 01:16:59.580 align:start position:0%
action by the bar
 
01:17:02.990 --> 01:17:03.000 align:start position:0%
um and and there would be the there
 
01:17:04.430 --> 01:17:04.440 align:start position:0%
would be no
 
01:17:06.950 --> 01:17:06.960 align:start position:0%
there were the uh the public officials
 
01:17:10.030 --> 01:17:10.040 align:start position:0%
who did this for a
 
01:17:12.709 --> 01:17:12.719 align:start position:0%
non-uh proper purpose would be subject
 
01:17:15.649 --> 01:17:15.659 align:start position:0%
to having the the uh right to know law
 
01:17:18.169 --> 01:17:18.179 align:start position:0%
their their decision reversed by the
 
01:17:20.209 --> 01:17:20.219 align:start position:0%
court uh under the right to know law as
 
01:17:22.370 --> 01:17:22.380 align:start position:0%
it is now so I just think that this
 
01:17:24.709 --> 01:17:24.719 align:start position:0%
adding this language doesn't really do
 
01:17:24.719 --> 01:17:26.270 align:start position:0%
adding this language doesn't really do
anything

01:17:26.270 --> 01:17:26.280 align:start position:0%
anything
 
01:17:28.010 --> 01:17:28.020 align:start position:0%
um and and that's basically the reason
 
01:17:31.490 --> 01:17:31.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:34.550 --> 01:17:34.560 align:start position:0%
representative org well I think
 
01:17:36.770 --> 01:17:36.780 align:start position:0%
I also would go further and this bill
 
01:17:38.530 --> 01:17:38.540 align:start position:0%
appears to be totally
 
01:17:40.970 --> 01:17:40.980 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional since everybody has
 
01:17:43.370 --> 01:17:43.380 align:start position:0%
everybody has the right to counsel um
 
01:17:47.570 --> 01:17:47.580 align:start position:0%
even a public official who's suspected
 
01:17:49.850 --> 01:17:49.860 align:start position:0%
of trying to evade right to no law in
 
01:17:51.709 --> 01:17:51.719 align:start position:0%
any case the council's
 
01:17:54.229 --> 01:17:54.239 align:start position:0%
role would properly just be to
 
01:17:57.290 --> 01:17:57.300 align:start position:0%
advice advise them how to uh how to
 
01:17:59.270 --> 01:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
comply with the law even though of
 
01:18:01.189 --> 01:18:01.199 align:start position:0%
course there's a lot of nuances on
 
01:18:02.510 --> 01:18:02.520 align:start position:0%
what's complying with the long what
 
01:18:04.910 --> 01:18:04.920 align:start position:0%
isn't complying with the law but yeah
 
01:18:06.110 --> 01:18:06.120 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't be able to approve the
 
01:18:08.990 --> 01:18:09.000 align:start position:0%
council wasn't merely trying to advise
 
01:18:12.410 --> 01:18:12.420 align:start position:0%
his or her client on how to stay within
 
01:18:13.970 --> 01:18:13.980 align:start position:0%
the boundaries of the law even if
 
01:18:15.410 --> 01:18:15.420 align:start position:0%
they're going very close to the boundary
 
01:18:18.470 --> 01:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:22.070 --> 01:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
any other comments on this bill
 
01:18:24.410 --> 01:18:24.420 align:start position:0%
all right are we ready for a vote then
 
01:18:27.290 --> 01:18:27.300 align:start position:0%
uh on uh
 
01:18:31.310 --> 01:18:31.320 align:start position:0%
uh HB 289 FN the motion on the floor is
 
01:18:33.410 --> 01:18:33.420 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate and I would ask
 
01:18:37.310 --> 01:18:37.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:40.729 --> 01:18:40.739 align:start position:0%

yeah
 
01:19:40.080 --> 01:19:42.729 align:start position:0%
yeah
um

01:19:42.729 --> 01:19:42.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:45.890 --> 01:19:45.900 align:start position:0%
all right and uh is there any reason
 
01:19:48.530 --> 01:19:48.540 align:start position:0%
that this cannot go on consent anybody
 
01:19:50.450 --> 01:19:50.460 align:start position:0%
anybody object to going on consent all
 
01:19:52.790 --> 01:19:52.800 align:start position:0%
right so we can go on consent
 
01:19:52.800 --> 01:19:53.510 align:start position:0%
right so we can go on consent
um

01:19:53.510 --> 01:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:56.510 --> 01:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
next I'm going to turn to
 
01:19:57.970 --> 01:19:57.980 align:start position:0%
um HB
 
01:19:57.980 --> 01:20:00.370 align:start position:0%
um HB
307

01:20:00.370 --> 01:20:00.380 align:start position:0%
307
 
01:20:02.990 --> 01:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
relative to attorney seizing actions
 
01:20:05.930 --> 01:20:05.940 align:start position:0%
under the right to no law and I would
 
01:20:08.390 --> 01:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
recognize representative Perez for a
 
01:20:08.400 --> 01:20:10.610 align:start position:0%
recognize representative Perez for a
motion

01:20:10.610 --> 01:20:10.620 align:start position:0%
motion
 
01:20:13.550 --> 01:20:13.560 align:start position:0%
yes I would like to make a motion to
 
01:20:16.669 --> 01:20:16.679 align:start position:0%
have this be ought to pass
 
01:20:19.490 --> 01:20:19.500 align:start position:0%
um is there uh I wanna we wanna hear
 
01:20:20.930 --> 01:20:20.940 align:start position:0%
from you but let me first ask you if
 
01:20:23.450 --> 01:20:23.460 align:start position:0%
there is a second a second the motion
 
01:20:26.090 --> 01:20:26.100 align:start position:0%
all right all right representative Perez
 
01:20:28.850 --> 01:20:28.860 align:start position:0%
fortunately for me this is a very simple
 
01:20:28.860 --> 01:20:30.310 align:start position:0%
fortunately for me this is a very simple
bill

01:20:30.310 --> 01:20:30.320 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:20:33.050 --> 01:20:33.060 align:start position:0%
basically going back to giving people
 
01:20:34.910 --> 01:20:34.920 align:start position:0%
the right to
 
01:20:38.510 --> 01:20:38.520 align:start position:0%
if a judgment is made in their favor the
 
01:20:41.270 --> 01:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
right to have their attorney fees return
 
01:20:43.250 --> 01:20:43.260 align:start position:0%
to them so it's
 
01:20:46.370 --> 01:20:46.380 align:start position:0%
it's appears to me to be very reasonable
 
01:20:46.380 --> 01:20:48.709 align:start position:0%
it's appears to me to be very reasonable
and

01:20:48.709 --> 01:20:48.719 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:20:51.229 --> 01:20:51.239 align:start position:0%
it's not until a final judgment is
 
01:20:55.010 --> 01:20:55.020 align:start position:0%
rendered so therefore I'm in favor of
 
01:20:57.649 --> 01:20:57.659 align:start position:0%
ought to pass right anyone else wish to
 
01:21:00.770 --> 01:21:00.780 align:start position:0%
speak to this bill
 
01:21:03.350 --> 01:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
um I I I'm just going to make a brief on
 
01:21:05.930 --> 01:21:05.940 align:start position:0%
it I'm I think we're
 
01:21:07.970 --> 01:21:07.980 align:start position:0%
pretty much I think pretty much everyone
 
01:21:11.270 --> 01:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
agrees to this and I I do think it's uh
 
01:21:14.030 --> 01:21:14.040 align:start position:0%
an appropriate change I'm particularly I
 
01:21:17.990 --> 01:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
think uh uh attorney Bissonnet from the
 
01:21:20.750 --> 01:21:20.760 align:start position:0%
ACLU who testified on the bill
 
01:21:23.689 --> 01:21:23.699 align:start position:0%
I mean I think I think his point was was
 
01:21:26.450 --> 01:21:26.460 align:start position:0%
very well taken that one of the one of
 
01:21:27.530 --> 01:21:27.540 align:start position:0%
the things that this bill will
 
01:21:30.890 --> 01:21:30.900 align:start position:0%
accomplish is it that it will it will
 
01:21:36.050 --> 01:21:36.060 align:start position:0%
sort of signal to public bodies that the
 
01:21:38.390 --> 01:21:38.400 align:start position:0%
default position the presumptive
 
01:21:41.390 --> 01:21:41.400 align:start position:0%
position ought to be that materials are
 
01:21:43.669 --> 01:21:43.679 align:start position:0%
are to be disclosed now sure there are
 
01:21:45.350 --> 01:21:45.360 align:start position:0%
reasons for not disclosing it in
 
01:21:49.430 --> 01:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
particular uh cases as specified in the
 
01:21:51.050 --> 01:21:51.060 align:start position:0%
statute but that
 
01:21:53.090 --> 01:21:53.100 align:start position:0%
ought not to be the presumption that
 
01:21:55.310 --> 01:21:55.320 align:start position:0%
local officials or state officials start
 
01:21:56.930 --> 01:21:56.940 align:start position:0%
out with I think he made a very good
 
01:21:59.390 --> 01:21:59.400 align:start position:0%
point on that and I think this this will
 
01:22:02.689 --> 01:22:02.699 align:start position:0%
will help to change the mindset it seems
 
01:22:03.950 --> 01:22:03.960 align:start position:0%
to me
 
01:22:06.470 --> 01:22:06.480 align:start position:0%
um and so and I and plus I'm just on the
 
01:22:08.510 --> 01:22:08.520 align:start position:0%
marriage I think it's a fair it's a fair
 
01:22:11.270 --> 01:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
change so I strongly support
 
01:22:13.250 --> 01:22:13.260 align:start position:0%
ought to pass
 
01:22:16.070 --> 01:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
anybody else wish to comment all right
 
01:22:19.430 --> 01:22:19.440 align:start position:0%
are we ready for a vote then um on HB
 
01:22:22.550 --> 01:22:22.560 align:start position:0%
307 FN the motion on the floor is ought
 
01:22:24.470 --> 01:22:24.480 align:start position:0%
to pass and I would ask the clerk to
 
01:22:25.729 --> 01:22:25.739 align:start position:0%
call the roll please
 
01:22:27.830 --> 01:22:27.840 align:start position:0%

and is there uh oh this is not a
 
01:23:12.290 --> 01:23:12.300 align:start position:0%
physical note so we can't get more of
 
01:23:15.910 --> 01:23:15.920 align:start position:0%
this it isn't it is indeterminate
 
01:23:19.550 --> 01:23:19.560 align:start position:0%
well I I I I think we probably should
 
01:23:21.530 --> 01:23:21.540 align:start position:0%
not try and put this on consent because
 
01:23:23.270 --> 01:23:23.280 align:start position:0%
I think I'm going to get pushbacks from
 
01:23:25.070 --> 01:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
the clerk so we'll put this on the
 
01:23:28.130 --> 01:23:28.140 align:start position:0%
regular uh calendar
 
01:23:28.140 --> 01:23:29.870 align:start position:0%

your motion yes um this is a great Bill
 
01:24:26.750 --> 01:24:26.760 align:start position:0%
Mr chair so I'll um last year we passed
 
01:24:28.189 --> 01:24:28.199 align:start position:0%
a bill that would require municipalities
 
01:24:30.350 --> 01:24:30.360 align:start position:0%
keep a list of minutes that are
 
01:24:31.850 --> 01:24:31.860 align:start position:0%
non-public in the date that those
 
01:24:34.430 --> 01:24:34.440 align:start position:0%
minutes were sealed so all this bill
 
01:24:36.470 --> 01:24:36.480 align:start position:0%
would do would
 
01:24:40.010 --> 01:24:40.020 align:start position:0%
um require that the public body review
 
01:24:42.169 --> 01:24:42.179 align:start position:0%
those minutes every 10 years and make a
 
01:24:43.490 --> 01:24:43.500 align:start position:0%
vote to determine whether those minutes
 
01:24:45.890 --> 01:24:45.900 align:start position:0%
should be unsealed or not
 
01:24:47.630 --> 01:24:47.640 align:start position:0%
um because there's a date already on the
 
01:24:49.550 --> 01:24:49.560 align:start position:0%
list it's a very simple bill that would
 
01:24:51.350 --> 01:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
actually New Hampshire Municipal

Association said it would have a
 
01:24:54.890 --> 01:24:54.900 align:start position:0%
negligible if any fiscal impact on
 
01:24:54.900 --> 01:24:56.510 align:start position:0%

um
 
01:26:16.729 --> 01:26:16.739 align:start position:0%
and again I see that there's a there's a
 
01:26:18.229 --> 01:26:18.239 align:start position:0%
FN on this
 
01:26:18.239 --> 01:26:19.430 align:start position:0%
FN on this
um

01:26:19.430 --> 01:26:19.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:22.850 --> 01:26:22.860 align:start position:0%
say here uh it's indeter minimal and in
 
01:26:25.490 --> 01:26:25.500 align:start position:0%
testimony it was minimal I think it's
 
01:26:27.110 --> 01:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
under like five thousand dollars Mr
 
01:26:28.970 --> 01:26:28.980 align:start position:0%
chair or something like that you don't
 
01:26:31.450 --> 01:26:31.460 align:start position:0%
have to put it on consensus issue
 
01:26:33.950 --> 01:26:33.960 align:start position:0%
all right so we'll try we'll put it on
 
01:26:39.169 --> 01:26:39.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:41.270 --> 01:26:41.280 align:start position:0%
all right either anybody should say
 
01:26:42.770 --> 01:26:42.780 align:start position:0%
anybody object to putting it on consent
 
01:26:45.649 --> 01:26:45.659 align:start position:0%
no either way Finance has to look at it
 
01:26:45.659 --> 01:26:52.810 align:start position:0%
no either way Finance has to look at it
anyways

01:26:52.810 --> 01:26:52.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:58.250 --> 01:26:58.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:00.770 --> 01:27:00.780 align:start position:0%
but I think we might be able to do that
 
01:27:03.770 --> 01:27:03.780 align:start position:0%
with 307 it says indeterminate all right
 
01:27:05.330 --> 01:27:05.340 align:start position:0%
so you know what let me just ask that's
 
01:27:07.729 --> 01:27:07.739 align:start position:0%
a good point let me just say is any
 
01:27:09.950 --> 01:27:09.960 align:start position:0%
would anybody if we could do it and we
 
01:27:11.510 --> 01:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
will make inquiry would anybody have a
 
01:27:13.910 --> 01:27:13.920 align:start position:0%
problem in putting 307 on consent if we
 
01:27:16.010 --> 01:27:16.020 align:start position:0%
can if we can do it
 
01:27:17.570 --> 01:27:17.580 align:start position:0%
anybody have a problem with that all
 
01:27:19.310 --> 01:27:19.320 align:start position:0%
right we'll we'll inquire and if we can
 
01:27:20.870 --> 01:27:20.880 align:start position:0%
we'll do it I'm going to put it on a
 
01:27:25.669 --> 01:27:25.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:27.590 --> 01:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
ask for forgiveness instead of
 
01:27:33.950 --> 01:27:33.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:35.450 --> 01:27:35.460 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:27:35.460 --> 01:27:36.950 align:start position:0%
all right
um

01:27:36.950 --> 01:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:40.310 --> 01:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
347 okay yeah I'm gonna turn next to uh
 
01:27:43.189 --> 01:27:43.199 align:start position:0%
HB 347.
 
01:27:43.199 --> 01:27:43.970 align:start position:0%
HB 347.
um

01:27:43.970 --> 01:27:43.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:47.330 --> 01:27:47.340 align:start position:0%
establishing a superior court uh land
 
01:27:49.790 --> 01:27:49.800 align:start position:0%
use docket and
 
01:27:49.800 --> 01:27:51.770 align:start position:0%
use docket and
um

01:27:51.770 --> 01:27:51.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:55.149 --> 01:27:55.159 align:start position:0%
I am going to recognize myself
 
01:28:00.530 --> 01:28:00.540 align:start position:0%
uh to make a mo I I have an amendment
 
01:28:03.290 --> 01:28:03.300 align:start position:0%
um Amendment the amendment is
 
01:28:03.300 --> 01:28:05.470 align:start position:0%
um Amendment the amendment is
um

01:28:05.470 --> 01:28:05.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:07.729 --> 01:28:07.739 align:start position:0%
2023-117 h
 
01:28:09.770 --> 01:28:09.780 align:start position:0%
and I would uh
 
01:28:12.290 --> 01:28:12.300 align:start position:0%
moves the amendment and
 
01:28:15.770 --> 01:28:15.780 align:start position:0%
um is there a second
 
01:28:18.050 --> 01:28:18.060 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I can second or representative
 
01:28:20.209 --> 01:28:20.219 align:start position:0%
Smith if you'd like to
 
01:28:21.890 --> 01:28:21.900 align:start position:0%
would you like to second that or do you
 
01:28:24.830 --> 01:28:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:26.110 --> 01:28:26.120 align:start position:0%
be happy
 
01:28:30.229 --> 01:28:30.239 align:start position:0%
so if I may speak to the motion um
 
01:28:33.350 --> 01:28:33.360 align:start position:0%
this bill would establish a
 
01:28:35.290 --> 01:28:35.300 align:start position:0%
Superior Court
 
01:28:37.990 --> 01:28:38.000 align:start position:0%
land use docket
 
01:28:40.729 --> 01:28:40.739 align:start position:0%
the amendment in particular let me just
 
01:28:42.709 --> 01:28:42.719 align:start position:0%
address that during the hearing you may
 
01:28:42.719 --> 01:28:43.810 align:start position:0%
address that during the hearing you may
recall

01:28:43.810 --> 01:28:43.820 align:start position:0%
recall
 
01:28:47.450 --> 01:28:47.460 align:start position:0%
representative uh Smith raised a a
 
01:28:50.570 --> 01:28:50.580 align:start position:0%
couple of questions uh very good points
 
01:28:54.530 --> 01:28:54.540 align:start position:0%
that um we needed that the way the
 
01:28:57.530 --> 01:28:57.540 align:start position:0%
original bill was drafted it said that
 
01:28:59.570 --> 01:28:59.580 align:start position:0%
there would be the governor would
 
01:29:03.410 --> 01:29:03.420 align:start position:0%
appoint the first Justice of the of the
 
01:29:05.689 --> 01:29:05.699 align:start position:0%
Superior Court land you socket didn't
 
01:29:08.990 --> 01:29:09.000 align:start position:0%
specifically say it had to be a new an
 
01:29:11.030 --> 01:29:11.040 align:start position:0%
additional judge so to speak so
 
01:29:12.770 --> 01:29:12.780 align:start position:0%
presumably if there were a vacancy on
 
01:29:13.790 --> 01:29:13.800 align:start position:0%
the Superior Court under the original
 
01:29:15.890 --> 01:29:15.900 align:start position:0%
Bill the governor could have just filled
 
01:29:17.689 --> 01:29:17.699 align:start position:0%
that vacancy with
 
01:29:19.790 --> 01:29:19.800 align:start position:0%
um with a
 
01:29:19.800 --> 01:29:21.770 align:start position:0%
um with a
uh

01:29:21.770 --> 01:29:21.780 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:29:24.830 --> 01:29:24.840 align:start position:0%
with an existing position this bill
 
01:29:26.750 --> 01:29:26.760 align:start position:0%
changes that language to make it clear
 
01:29:29.090 --> 01:29:29.100 align:start position:0%
that it's uh that it's an additional
 
01:29:31.490 --> 01:29:31.500 align:start position:0%
Justice of the superior court and in
 
01:29:34.970 --> 01:29:34.980 align:start position:0%
section two of the bill it specifically
 
01:29:38.330 --> 01:29:38.340 align:start position:0%
uh indicates that this that the
 
01:29:41.930 --> 01:29:41.940 align:start position:0%
um the uh Staffing of the Superior Court
 
01:29:44.209 --> 01:29:44.219 align:start position:0%
shall be increased from a chief justice
 
01:29:47.390 --> 01:29:47.400 align:start position:0%
and 21 justices to his chief justice and
 
01:29:51.410 --> 01:29:51.420 align:start position:0%
22 associate Justice the other point
 
01:29:53.090 --> 01:29:53.100 align:start position:0%
that um
 
01:29:56.689 --> 01:29:56.699 align:start position:0%
uh representative Smith uh uh discussed
 
01:29:58.610 --> 01:29:58.620 align:start position:0%
with me and I've made it made sense to
 
01:30:01.129 --> 01:30:01.139 align:start position:0%
me I didn't have any problem with it was
 
01:30:06.830 --> 01:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
to add language on page to line one
 
01:30:09.169 --> 01:30:09.179 align:start position:0%
you'll see it at language has been added
 
01:30:11.930 --> 01:30:11.940 align:start position:0%
that says nothing in this section shall
 
01:30:13.729 --> 01:30:13.739 align:start position:0%
affect the concurrent jurisdiction of
 
01:30:16.010 --> 01:30:16.020 align:start position:0%
the housing appeals board to hear
 
01:30:19.129 --> 01:30:19.139 align:start position:0%
appeals within the jurisdiction uh
 
01:30:21.229 --> 01:30:21.239 align:start position:0%
within its jurisdiction brought pursuant
 
01:30:24.470 --> 01:30:24.480 align:start position:0%
to RSA 679 so
 
01:30:28.010 --> 01:30:28.020 align:start position:0%
what I I think that even if that
 
01:30:29.390 --> 01:30:29.400 align:start position:0%
language had not been included the
 
01:30:31.010 --> 01:30:31.020 align:start position:0%
result would be the same because nothing
 
01:30:33.830 --> 01:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
in this bill would propose to you know
 
01:30:37.669 --> 01:30:37.679 align:start position:0%
Outlaw or or change the land use uh
 
01:30:40.250 --> 01:30:40.260 align:start position:0%
other housing appeals board but
 
01:30:42.169 --> 01:30:42.179 align:start position:0%
um it it doesn't hurt to have that in
 
01:30:43.850 --> 01:30:43.860 align:start position:0%
there and I therefore had no objection
 
01:30:46.669 --> 01:30:46.679 align:start position:0%
to when when representative Smith raised
 
01:30:48.470 --> 01:30:48.480 align:start position:0%
that to including
 
01:30:52.550 --> 01:30:52.560 align:start position:0%
um this in the language so I think
 
01:30:55.910 --> 01:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
um the amendment uh makes sense and I
 
01:30:57.830 --> 01:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
think for the reasons that I stated at
 
01:31:01.189 --> 01:31:01.199 align:start position:0%
the hearing that it does make sense to
 
01:31:04.430 --> 01:31:04.440 align:start position:0%
have a superior court land use stock it
 
01:31:06.410 --> 01:31:06.420 align:start position:0%
I I have to say
 
01:31:08.450 --> 01:31:08.460 align:start position:0%
that um
 
01:31:10.910 --> 01:31:10.920 align:start position:0%
I have heard an argument not from anyone
 
01:31:12.530 --> 01:31:12.540 align:start position:0%
on this committee but
 
01:31:16.129 --> 01:31:16.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:17.750 --> 01:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
I've heard an argument from some people
 
01:31:21.669 --> 01:31:21.679 align:start position:0%
saying No this is a bad idea
 
01:31:23.870 --> 01:31:23.880 align:start position:0%
to have
 
01:31:26.209 --> 01:31:26.219 align:start position:0%
um to have
 
01:31:28.250 --> 01:31:28.260 align:start position:0%
um you'll notice it in the bill it says
 
01:31:29.750 --> 01:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
that you know the first judge of this of
 
01:31:30.950 --> 01:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
the land you stalk it has to be somebody
 
01:31:33.550 --> 01:31:33.560 align:start position:0%
who's uh uh
 
01:31:36.530 --> 01:31:36.540 align:start position:0%
has experience in land use law and that
 
01:31:38.510 --> 01:31:38.520 align:start position:0%
kind of thing they think somebody you
 
01:31:40.910 --> 01:31:40.920 align:start position:0%
know said to me that's a bad idea so I
 
01:31:41.990 --> 01:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
can't help thinking you know just
 
01:31:43.370 --> 01:31:43.380 align:start position:0%
thinking to myself and I said to them so
 
01:31:45.709 --> 01:31:45.719 align:start position:0%
it's the idea that you would rather have
 
01:31:48.050 --> 01:31:48.060 align:start position:0%
somebody deciding land use cases who
 
01:31:51.470 --> 01:31:51.480 align:start position:0%
knows nothing about land use law or I
 
01:31:53.810 --> 01:31:53.820 align:start position:0%
mean that is that a better is that a
 
01:31:55.790 --> 01:31:55.800 align:start position:0%
better way to go I I don't think so
 
01:31:58.550 --> 01:31:58.560 align:start position:0%
these are as I think you've heard at the
 
01:32:01.550 --> 01:32:01.560 align:start position:0%
um at the hearing the these are these
 
01:32:04.490 --> 01:32:04.500 align:start position:0%
candy pretty complicated cases and it
 
01:32:06.830 --> 01:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
does seem to me that it makes sense to
 
01:32:09.649 --> 01:32:09.659 align:start position:0%
have uh someone who has expertise in
 
01:32:12.169 --> 01:32:12.179 align:start position:0%
that area and I would again I would note
 
01:32:14.090 --> 01:32:14.100 align:start position:0%
by analogy
 
01:32:17.090 --> 01:32:17.100 align:start position:0%
uh to the business uh the Superior Court
 
01:32:19.610 --> 01:32:19.620 align:start position:0%
business court docket that's been in
 
01:32:22.310 --> 01:32:22.320 align:start position:0%
effect now for over 10 years probably 15
 
01:32:22.320 --> 01:32:23.629 align:start position:0%
effect now for over 10 years probably 15
years

01:32:23.629 --> 01:32:23.639 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:32:25.970 --> 01:32:25.980 align:start position:0%
um it's really been the first Justice
 
01:32:28.010 --> 01:32:28.020 align:start position:0%
appointed for that was Justice McNamara
 
01:32:30.410 --> 01:32:30.420 align:start position:0%
had a great deal of familiarity in
 
01:32:32.689 --> 01:32:32.699 align:start position:0%
business law matters
 
01:32:34.669 --> 01:32:34.679 align:start position:0%
um and uh from everything that I've
 
01:32:34.679 --> 01:32:35.930 align:start position:0%
um and uh from everything that I've
heard

01:32:35.930 --> 01:32:35.940 align:start position:0%
heard
 
01:32:38.030 --> 01:32:38.040 align:start position:0%
um he served he served until he written
 
01:32:40.370 --> 01:32:40.380 align:start position:0%
to you reached the mandatory retirement
 
01:32:43.669 --> 01:32:43.679 align:start position:0%
age and really did a I think you know if
 
01:32:45.410 --> 01:32:45.420 align:start position:0%
you check with among any members of the
 
01:32:47.510 --> 01:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
bar I would say he really did a very
 
01:32:50.090 --> 01:32:50.100 align:start position:0%
excellent job uh in that and it was that
 
01:32:52.070 --> 01:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
it that was and now and judge Anderson
 
01:32:54.410 --> 01:32:54.420 align:start position:0%
has taken over that docket
 
01:32:57.110 --> 01:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
um it was and is uh success and I think
 
01:33:00.290 --> 01:33:00.300 align:start position:0%
the land use stock it was uh would would
 
01:33:02.629 --> 01:33:02.639 align:start position:0%
turn out to be the same way so for that
 
01:33:04.430 --> 01:33:04.440 align:start position:0%
reason I hope you will uh support the
 
01:33:06.709 --> 01:33:06.719 align:start position:0%
amendment and then support voting on the
 
01:33:10.629 --> 01:33:10.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:14.750 --> 01:33:14.760 align:start position:0%
yeah so first we anybody anyone want to
 
01:33:17.330 --> 01:33:17.340 align:start position:0%
yes representative Perez I just have a
 
01:33:19.490 --> 01:33:19.500 align:start position:0%
quick question this does not prohibit
 
01:33:22.189 --> 01:33:22.199 align:start position:0%
them from taking a Justice who is there
 
01:33:24.530 --> 01:33:24.540 align:start position:0%
already moving them to this where they
 
01:33:26.270 --> 01:33:26.280 align:start position:0%
have experience and then bringing
 
01:33:28.490 --> 01:33:28.500 align:start position:0%
someone else in or does it no I don't
 
01:33:29.870 --> 01:33:29.880 align:start position:0%
think it does in other words they just
 
01:33:32.810 --> 01:33:32.820 align:start position:0%
have to be it has this has to give a new
 
01:33:35.209 --> 01:33:35.219 align:start position:0%
a new Justice and the person and the
 
01:33:37.550 --> 01:33:37.560 align:start position:0%
person who was chosen even if it was a
 
01:33:39.410 --> 01:33:39.420 align:start position:0%
an existing Justice would have to be
 
01:33:42.050 --> 01:33:42.060 align:start position:0%
someone who fits the definition of you
 
01:33:45.169 --> 01:33:45.179 align:start position:0%
know having experience in that area
 
01:33:45.179 --> 01:33:46.910 align:start position:0%
know having experience in that area
other

01:33:46.910 --> 01:33:46.920 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:33:49.490 --> 01:33:49.500 align:start position:0%
any other questions so I think this is
 
01:33:52.129 --> 01:33:52.139 align:start position:0%
on the amendment I think we can vote uh
 
01:33:54.410 --> 01:33:54.420 align:start position:0%
by by a Voice vote unless anybody wants
 
01:33:56.090 --> 01:33:56.100 align:start position:0%
to have it be a show of hands or a roll
 
01:33:56.100 --> 01:33:57.590 align:start position:0%
to have it be a show of hands or a roll
call

01:33:57.590 --> 01:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
call
 
01:33:59.030 --> 01:33:59.040 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
01:34:01.010 --> 01:34:01.020 align:start position:0%
um I uh call the question all those in
 
01:34:02.649 --> 01:34:02.659 align:start position:0%
favor of amendment
 
01:34:08.270 --> 01:34:08.280 align:start position:0%

move to the main bill of of uh
 
01:34:20.990 --> 01:34:21.000 align:start position:0%

going to vote against this bill and I
 
01:34:39.530 --> 01:34:39.540 align:start position:0%
have not changed my mind
 
01:34:43.870 --> 01:34:43.880 align:start position:0%
in 2022 we had another bill House Bill
 
01:34:47.570 --> 01:34:47.580 align:start position:0%
excuse me 1389
 
01:34:50.870 --> 01:34:50.880 align:start position:0%
it was went to interim study they had an
 
01:34:54.649 --> 01:34:54.659 align:start position:0%
interim Study last November we voted in
 
01:34:57.530 --> 01:34:57.540 align:start position:0%
judiciary not to go further with the
 
01:35:01.729 --> 01:35:01.739 align:start position:0%
bill and what was written on it is the
 
01:35:01.739 --> 01:35:03.189 align:start position:0%
bill and what was written on it is the
following

01:35:03.189 --> 01:35:03.199 align:start position:0%
following
 
01:35:05.689 --> 01:35:05.699 align:start position:0%
uh not recommended for future
 
01:35:05.699 --> 01:35:07.669 align:start position:0%
uh not recommended for future
legislation

01:35:07.669 --> 01:35:07.679 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:35:10.189 --> 01:35:10.199 align:start position:0%
this bill provided for the establishment
 
01:35:12.649 --> 01:35:12.659 align:start position:0%
of a judge to decide land use cases
 
01:35:14.930 --> 01:35:14.940 align:start position:0%
within the existing structure of New
 
01:35:17.149 --> 01:35:17.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's superiors Court while the
 
01:35:19.610 --> 01:35:19.620 align:start position:0%
idea of creating a specialized Co-op to
 
01:35:22.370 --> 01:35:22.380 align:start position:0%
hear cases arising from Municipal land
 
01:35:25.610 --> 01:35:25.620 align:start position:0%
use board decisions has some Merit the
 
01:35:28.010 --> 01:35:28.020 align:start position:0%
majority of the committee considered the
 
01:35:29.570 --> 01:35:29.580 align:start position:0%
present status of the New Hampshire
 
01:35:32.270 --> 01:35:32.280 align:start position:0%
judicial branches caseload and the lack
 
01:35:34.850 --> 01:35:34.860 align:start position:0%
of the full complement of 21 Superior
 
01:35:37.129 --> 01:35:37.139 align:start position:0%
Court judges sitting on the bench and
 
01:35:39.410 --> 01:35:39.420 align:start position:0%
determined that this initiative is not
 
01:35:42.350 --> 01:35:42.360 align:start position:0%
presently appropriate in addition it was
 
01:35:44.330 --> 01:35:44.340 align:start position:0%
suggested that targeted judicial
 
01:35:46.669 --> 01:35:46.679 align:start position:0%
training in the state's coal land use
 
01:35:49.310 --> 01:35:49.320 align:start position:0%
principle May adequately address the
 
01:35:51.709 --> 01:35:51.719 align:start position:0%
concern which gave the rise to this bill
 
01:35:54.530 --> 01:35:54.540 align:start position:0%
the vote was fourteen to five my thing
 
01:35:58.250 --> 01:35:58.260 align:start position:0%
is this for years the legislature has
 
01:36:01.189 --> 01:36:01.199 align:start position:0%
made laws and told the towns
 
01:36:03.530 --> 01:36:03.540 align:start position:0%
within reason why you can do what you
 
01:36:05.870 --> 01:36:05.880 align:start position:0%
can't do for your zoning and and they
 
01:36:09.350 --> 01:36:09.360 align:start position:0%
could make up their own policies etc etc
 
01:36:13.189 --> 01:36:13.199 align:start position:0%
if all that was good for years what is a
 
01:36:17.570 --> 01:36:17.580 align:start position:0%
problem now I really don't understand as
 
01:36:20.330 --> 01:36:20.340 align:start position:0%
far as I'm concerned we are taking the
 
01:36:25.189 --> 01:36:25.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:28.370 --> 01:36:28.380 align:start position:0%
if they are making bad decisions which
 
01:36:29.750 --> 01:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
anybody can
 
01:36:32.510 --> 01:36:32.520 align:start position:0%
then they should receive appropriate
 
01:36:35.689 --> 01:36:35.699 align:start position:0%
training so these bad decisions don't
 
01:36:35.699 --> 01:36:36.830 align:start position:0%
training so these bad decisions don't
continue

01:36:36.830 --> 01:36:36.840 align:start position:0%
continue
 
01:36:40.250 --> 01:36:40.260 align:start position:0%
we also have the house appeals board you
 
01:36:42.530 --> 01:36:42.540 align:start position:0%
can currently take a case to Superior
 
01:36:45.169 --> 01:36:45.179 align:start position:0%
Court I think personally we are just
 
01:36:47.990 --> 01:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
adding another layer why are we singling
 
01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:49.129 align:start position:0%
adding another layer why are we singling
out

01:36:49.129 --> 01:36:49.139 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:36:53.149 --> 01:36:53.159 align:start position:0%
land use when in Syria Superior Court I
 
01:36:54.590 --> 01:36:54.600 align:start position:0%
believe there's a lot of other
 
01:36:57.530 --> 01:36:57.540 align:start position:0%
particular cases that maybe we should
 
01:36:59.990 --> 01:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
hire one judge and they take over those
 
01:37:02.870 --> 01:37:02.880 align:start position:0%
cases again I'm going to vote no on this
 
01:37:04.430 --> 01:37:04.440 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you
 
01:37:06.950 --> 01:37:06.960 align:start position:0%
other yes representative Alexander thank
 
01:37:09.169 --> 01:37:09.179 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair I I think this bill is a
 
01:37:10.370 --> 01:37:10.380 align:start position:0%
great bill
 
01:37:12.950 --> 01:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
um it sets up a separate land use docket
 
01:37:14.870 --> 01:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
that a judge with that particular
 
01:37:17.629 --> 01:37:17.639 align:start position:0%
expertise is able to evaluate land use
 
01:37:21.050 --> 01:37:21.060 align:start position:0%
decisions it allows somebody that would
 
01:37:23.629 --> 01:37:23.639 align:start position:0%
like to appeal a ruling of a local board
 
01:37:25.430 --> 01:37:25.440 align:start position:0%
can go to the housing appeals board now
 
01:37:27.350 --> 01:37:27.360 align:start position:0%
with this amendment language or choose
 
01:37:29.689 --> 01:37:29.699 align:start position:0%
to go to the land you stock it this adds
 
01:37:31.310 --> 01:37:31.320 align:start position:0%
an extra judge and that was the concern
 
01:37:33.770 --> 01:37:33.780 align:start position:0%
last year in judiciary when we retained
 
01:37:35.510 --> 01:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
the bill was we didn't have the
 
01:37:37.910 --> 01:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
resources to at that time is the second
 
01:37:40.129 --> 01:37:40.139 align:start position:0%
year to appoint a new judge now we can
 
01:37:41.570 --> 01:37:41.580 align:start position:0%
do that I think it gives them a great
 
01:37:43.669 --> 01:37:43.679 align:start position:0%
opportunity to pick where you'd like to
 
01:37:46.250 --> 01:37:46.260 align:start position:0%
appeal it there's dockets for a number
 
01:37:48.110 --> 01:37:48.120 align:start position:0%
of issue areas there's the family court
 
01:37:49.910 --> 01:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
there's a bunch of different areas I
 
01:37:52.430 --> 01:37:52.440 align:start position:0%
think by appointing one Justice or one
 
01:37:54.550 --> 01:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
judge to this particular area
 
01:37:56.689 --> 01:37:56.699 align:start position:0%
the reason why we need to do this
 
01:37:58.669 --> 01:37:58.679 align:start position:0%
because there's a housing crisis and
 
01:38:01.550 --> 01:38:01.560 align:start position:0%
let's allow the courts to evaluate each
 
01:38:02.810 --> 01:38:02.820 align:start position:0%
and every decision on their own Merit
 
01:38:04.070 --> 01:38:04.080 align:start position:0%
but allow the judge with that particular
 
01:38:06.110 --> 01:38:06.120 align:start position:0%
expertise let's do it thank you
 
01:38:08.510 --> 01:38:08.520 align:start position:0%
are there anyone else comments yes
 
01:38:10.390 --> 01:38:10.400 align:start position:0%
representative Perez
 
01:38:13.970 --> 01:38:13.980 align:start position:0%
clarification when was that study done
 
01:38:16.209 --> 01:38:16.219 align:start position:0%
this past year
 
01:38:16.219 --> 01:38:18.169 align:start position:0%
this past year
2022

01:38:18.169 --> 01:38:18.179 align:start position:0%
2022
 
01:38:20.450 --> 01:38:20.460 align:start position:0%
um and then another question yes is it
 
01:38:22.310 --> 01:38:22.320 align:start position:0%
not by understanding please correct me
 
01:38:23.390 --> 01:38:23.400 align:start position:0%
if I Wrong
 
01:38:25.629 --> 01:38:25.639 align:start position:0%
um is the new
 
01:38:29.750 --> 01:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
budget financials is that also putting
 
01:38:33.050 --> 01:38:33.060 align:start position:0%
forward to add an additional five
 
01:38:36.430 --> 01:38:36.440 align:start position:0%
justices as well
 
01:38:39.470 --> 01:38:39.480 align:start position:0%
no no well I'm sorry representative
 
01:38:39.480 --> 01:38:43.129 align:start position:0%
no no well I'm sorry representative
Smith

01:38:43.129 --> 01:38:43.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:46.550 --> 01:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
first of all we don't know
 
01:38:49.550 --> 01:38:49.560 align:start position:0%
the answer to that because we don't know
 
01:38:53.830 --> 01:38:53.840 align:start position:0%
until February 14th what the governor
 
01:38:58.850 --> 01:38:58.860 align:start position:0%
proposes to put in his budget we do know
 
01:39:00.770 --> 01:39:00.780 align:start position:0%
that you have to look at the differences
 
01:39:03.229 --> 01:39:03.239 align:start position:0%
between the Circuit Court which is very
 
01:39:06.350 --> 01:39:06.360 align:start position:0%
short and the Superior Court which is
 
01:39:09.590 --> 01:39:09.600 align:start position:0%
also short what this language in this
 
01:39:11.810 --> 01:39:11.820 align:start position:0%
field does is addressed only the
 
01:39:14.870 --> 01:39:14.880 align:start position:0%
superior court and says that there has
 
01:39:18.229 --> 01:39:18.239 align:start position:0%
to be an additional
 
01:39:21.290 --> 01:39:21.300 align:start position:0%
um an additional judge added to the
 
01:39:23.570 --> 01:39:23.580 align:start position:0%
roster that had been 21 and would go up
 
01:39:26.990 --> 01:39:27.000 align:start position:0%
to 22. when we vote on this bill it will
 
01:39:29.330 --> 01:39:29.340 align:start position:0%
go to the house and it will then go to
 
01:39:31.610 --> 01:39:31.620 align:start position:0%
division if it passes
 
01:39:34.129 --> 01:39:34.139 align:start position:0%
and I have every reason to believe it it
 
01:39:36.290 --> 01:39:36.300 align:start position:0%
will pass in part because of the
 
01:39:39.410 --> 01:39:39.420 align:start position:0%
identity of the Prime sponsor
 
01:39:41.330 --> 01:39:41.340 align:start position:0%
um and we have to take that into account
 
01:39:41.340 --> 01:39:45.669 align:start position:0%
um and we have to take that into account
too

01:39:45.669 --> 01:39:45.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:48.649 --> 01:39:48.659 align:start position:0%
I'm serious I'm serious I mean we you
 
01:39:51.530 --> 01:39:51.540 align:start position:0%
know that that is a factor it will go to
 
01:39:53.830 --> 01:39:53.840 align:start position:0%
division one
 
01:39:57.169 --> 01:39:57.179 align:start position:0%
of finance division one has a lot of
 
01:39:59.830 --> 01:39:59.840 align:start position:0%
responsibilities including the Judiciary
 
01:40:03.590 --> 01:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
they can what they will likely do is
 
01:40:05.270 --> 01:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
hold this bill
 
01:40:08.689 --> 01:40:08.699 align:start position:0%
until they see what the governor has
 
01:40:11.689 --> 01:40:11.699 align:start position:0%
proposed in the budget because they will
 
01:40:13.850 --> 01:40:13.860 align:start position:0%
not I don't believe they will handle
 
01:40:16.490 --> 01:40:16.500 align:start position:0%
this separately they will want to make
 
01:40:18.970 --> 01:40:18.980 align:start position:0%
sure that there is an additional
 
01:40:23.689 --> 01:40:23.699 align:start position:0%
uh Superior Court judge
 
01:40:25.550 --> 01:40:25.560 align:start position:0%
yes representative Perez
 
01:40:28.550 --> 01:40:28.560 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I just so is it my
 
01:40:30.129 --> 01:40:30.139 align:start position:0%
understanding that
 
01:40:34.430 --> 01:40:34.440 align:start position:0%
specifically a Justice a judge for this
 
01:40:34.440 --> 01:40:36.530 align:start position:0%
specifically a Justice a judge for this
particular

01:40:36.530 --> 01:40:36.540 align:start position:0%
particular
 
01:40:40.250 --> 01:40:40.260 align:start position:0%
um need was addressed by this group
 
01:40:43.970 --> 01:40:43.980 align:start position:0%
minus new people last summer and was
 
01:40:43.980 --> 01:40:45.229 align:start position:0%
minus new people last summer and was
voted

01:40:45.229 --> 01:40:45.239 align:start position:0%
voted
 
01:40:48.110 --> 01:40:48.120 align:start position:0%
down it correct me if I'm wrong
 
01:40:50.870 --> 01:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
was voted not to have or went down
 
01:40:53.590 --> 01:40:53.600 align:start position:0%
fourteen to five is that what I'm
 
01:40:56.270 --> 01:40:56.280 align:start position:0%
understanding from the information from
 
01:40:58.669 --> 01:40:58.679 align:start position:0%
representative Andrus and if I could
 
01:41:00.350 --> 01:41:00.360 align:start position:0%
follow up on that you're you're
 
01:41:02.450 --> 01:41:02.460 align:start position:0%
absolutely right
 
01:41:06.070 --> 01:41:06.080 align:start position:0%
um but circumstances change
 
01:41:10.370 --> 01:41:10.380 align:start position:0%
last time if I remember correctly there
 
01:41:12.770 --> 01:41:12.780 align:start position:0%
was no provision that said
 
01:41:14.930 --> 01:41:14.940 align:start position:0%
if this and I'm sure representative
 
01:41:17.810 --> 01:41:17.820 align:start position:0%
Alexander will correct me if I'm wrong
 
01:41:21.410 --> 01:41:21.420 align:start position:0%
um this there was no language that said
 
01:41:24.950 --> 01:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
there had to be an additional judge the
 
01:41:27.050 --> 01:41:27.060 align:start position:0%
concern of the Judiciary Committee in
 
01:41:29.330 --> 01:41:29.340 align:start position:0%
the previous term and I believe the
 
01:41:32.330 --> 01:41:32.340 align:start position:0%
concern is Judiciary Committee today is
 
01:41:36.109 --> 01:41:36.119 align:start position:0%
that there are not enough judges to
 
01:41:39.950 --> 01:41:39.960 align:start position:0%
handle uh the caseload in the superior
 
01:41:43.370 --> 01:41:43.380 align:start position:0%
and circuit courts
 
01:41:48.350 --> 01:41:48.360 align:start position:0%
um in a manner that is timely and we all
 
01:41:50.330 --> 01:41:50.340 align:start position:0%
know that Justice delayed is Justice
 
01:41:53.570 --> 01:41:53.580 align:start position:0%
denied a key difference in this bill is
 
01:41:55.490 --> 01:41:55.500 align:start position:0%
not only that there would be someone who
 
01:41:59.149 --> 01:41:59.159 align:start position:0%
had specific knowledge but that in order
 
01:42:02.209 --> 01:42:02.219 align:start position:0%
for this bill to be passed there would
 
01:42:06.770 --> 01:42:06.780 align:start position:0%
have to be an additional judge added so
 
01:42:09.290 --> 01:42:09.300 align:start position:0%
that the um the caseload
 
01:42:12.169 --> 01:42:12.179 align:start position:0%
responsibilities would would switch
 
01:42:15.229 --> 01:42:15.239 align:start position:0%
and so that was I think a a key
 
01:42:19.609 --> 01:42:19.619 align:start position:0%
difference and uh because this is a
 
01:42:20.810 --> 01:42:20.820 align:start position:0%
budget year
 
01:42:24.890 --> 01:42:24.900 align:start position:0%
whereas 2020 uh two was not a budget
 
01:42:28.430 --> 01:42:28.440 align:start position:0%
year there was no way to be able to add
 
01:42:31.910 --> 01:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
an additional adjuster to the superior
 
01:42:36.350 --> 01:42:36.360 align:start position:0%
Corps and now the timing is that we can
 
01:42:40.129 --> 01:42:40.139 align:start position:0%
we have the possibility of adding
 
01:42:42.590 --> 01:42:42.600 align:start position:0%
um a Justice where we didn't have last
 
01:42:44.810 --> 01:42:44.820 align:start position:0%
year representative Perez
 
01:42:47.330 --> 01:42:47.340 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry the learning process
 
01:42:50.510 --> 01:42:50.520 align:start position:0%
did I not also hear that a study was
 
01:42:53.510 --> 01:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
done prior to that decision last fall
 
01:42:57.590 --> 01:42:57.600 align:start position:0%
about the caseload of justices
 
01:42:57.600 --> 01:42:59.270 align:start position:0%
about the caseload of justices
yeah

01:42:59.270 --> 01:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:43:02.689 --> 01:43:02.699 align:start position:0%
well no no that I think I I can answer
 
01:43:05.990 --> 01:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
that so you need to I think you need to
 
01:43:07.250 --> 01:43:07.260 align:start position:0%
understand we're talking about we're
 
01:43:09.530 --> 01:43:09.540 align:start position:0%
talking about there was a study done not
 
01:43:12.050 --> 01:43:12.060 align:start position:0%
but it was not just about the superior
 
01:43:16.250 --> 01:43:16.260 align:start position:0%
court and that study was not was in
 
01:43:16.260 --> 01:43:17.209 align:start position:0%
court and that study was not was in
process

01:43:17.209 --> 01:43:17.219 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:43:20.930 --> 01:43:20.940 align:start position:0%
but the the study itself didn't come out
 
01:43:20.940 --> 01:43:22.970 align:start position:0%
but the the study itself didn't come out
until

01:43:22.970 --> 01:43:22.980 align:start position:0%
until
 
01:43:24.530 --> 01:43:24.540 align:start position:0%
I believe it was
 
01:43:27.169 --> 01:43:27.179 align:start position:0%
it was the it was like last fun it was
 
01:43:28.430 --> 01:43:28.440 align:start position:0%
that was after the session I think it
 
01:43:30.709 --> 01:43:30.719 align:start position:0%
came I think it came out in November or
 
01:43:33.470 --> 01:43:33.480 align:start position:0%
December of last year
 
01:43:36.250 --> 01:43:36.260 align:start position:0%
um it was a weighted caseload study
 
01:43:40.070 --> 01:43:40.080 align:start position:0%
which shows that both the the superior
 
01:43:42.229 --> 01:43:42.239 align:start position:0%
and the Circuit Court need additional
 
01:43:45.950 --> 01:43:45.960 align:start position:0%
judgeships anyway and particularly the
 
01:43:47.930 --> 01:43:47.940 align:start position:0%
sir I mean the situation is particularly
 
01:43:49.729 --> 01:43:49.739 align:start position:0%
acute in the Circuit Court which is not
 
01:43:51.350 --> 01:43:51.360 align:start position:0%
what this deals with
 
01:43:53.750 --> 01:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
um I believe
 
01:43:55.010 --> 01:43:55.020 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:43:57.109 --> 01:43:57.119 align:start position:0%
you know you got this was based upon a
 
01:43:58.370 --> 01:43:58.380 align:start position:0%
discussion I had with Chief Justice
 
01:44:00.890 --> 01:44:00.900 align:start position:0%
McDonald a while ago so things his
 
01:44:02.990 --> 01:44:03.000 align:start position:0%
thinking on this may have changed but I
 
01:44:05.390 --> 01:44:05.400 align:start position:0%
believe there was going to be a request
 
01:44:07.189 --> 01:44:07.199 align:start position:0%
in the budget
 
01:44:09.770 --> 01:44:09.780 align:start position:0%
for the Circuit Court to increase the
 
01:44:11.870 --> 01:44:11.880 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court judgeships by seven I
 
01:44:11.880 --> 01:44:13.070 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court judgeships by seven I
believe

01:44:13.070 --> 01:44:13.080 align:start position:0%
believe
 
01:44:15.050 --> 01:44:15.060 align:start position:0%
um because there there's a weighted case
 
01:44:17.450 --> 01:44:17.460 align:start position:0%
study which is pretty complicated but it
 
01:44:19.430 --> 01:44:19.440 align:start position:0%
kind of explains how many judges are
 
01:44:22.310 --> 01:44:22.320 align:start position:0%
needed in the bottom line and that was
 
01:44:25.010 --> 01:44:25.020 align:start position:0%
what was was shown to be needed
 
01:44:28.370 --> 01:44:28.380 align:start position:0%
um in the in the circuit court now
 
01:44:30.590 --> 01:44:30.600 align:start position:0%
with regard to as as I think
 
01:44:32.270 --> 01:44:32.280 align:start position:0%
representative Smith alluded to but with
 
01:44:33.410 --> 01:44:33.420 align:start position:0%
regard to I think we should all
 
01:44:35.390 --> 01:44:35.400 align:start position:0%
understand it's particularly the people
 
01:44:36.649 --> 01:44:36.659 align:start position:0%
who are new
 
01:44:39.830 --> 01:44:39.840 align:start position:0%
if we pass this bill it goes to finance
 
01:44:39.840 --> 01:44:41.390 align:start position:0%
if we pass this bill it goes to finance
Finance

01:44:41.390 --> 01:44:41.400 align:start position:0%
Finance
 
01:44:44.149 --> 01:44:44.159 align:start position:0%
they're under no obligation to to pass
 
01:44:46.310 --> 01:44:46.320 align:start position:0%
it just because we did and they will
 
01:44:49.850 --> 01:44:49.860 align:start position:0%
consider the bigger picture and they
 
01:44:51.950 --> 01:44:51.960 align:start position:0%
might you know they not only the
 
01:44:53.270 --> 01:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
judicial branch but the whole budget
 
01:44:54.530 --> 01:44:54.540 align:start position:0%
they they're going to have to figure out
 
01:44:54.540 --> 01:44:55.370 align:start position:0%
they they're going to have to figure out
what

01:44:55.370 --> 01:44:55.380 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:44:57.770 --> 01:44:57.780 align:start position:0%
priorities for the whole budget so they
 
01:45:00.229 --> 01:45:00.239 align:start position:0%
you know hopefully I guess I'm hopeful
 
01:45:01.970 --> 01:45:01.980 align:start position:0%
that they will agree with us if we pass
 
01:45:04.850 --> 01:45:04.860 align:start position:0%
this but it's you know it'll be up to
 
01:45:07.250 --> 01:45:07.260 align:start position:0%
them to make another serious look at
 
01:45:09.410 --> 01:45:09.420 align:start position:0%
this in terms of the overall Financial
 
01:45:11.870 --> 01:45:11.880 align:start position:0%
picture of the judicial branch and the
 
01:45:14.330 --> 01:45:14.340 align:start position:0%
and the the state as a whole
 
01:45:15.890 --> 01:45:15.900 align:start position:0%
um then they'll make their
 
01:45:17.330 --> 01:45:17.340 align:start position:0%
recommendation and then eventually it
 
01:45:19.250 --> 01:45:19.260 align:start position:0%
will come back to the whole house to be
 
01:45:21.169 --> 01:45:21.179 align:start position:0%
voting on the budget
 
01:45:23.090 --> 01:45:23.100 align:start position:0%
yeah I've just had one more Point
 
01:45:26.149 --> 01:45:26.159 align:start position:0%
although nobody follows this the reality
 
01:45:29.209 --> 01:45:29.219 align:start position:0%
is that this is a policy committee and
 
01:45:31.250 --> 01:45:31.260 align:start position:0%
we are looking at the policy does it
 
01:45:35.390 --> 01:45:35.400 align:start position:0%
make sense to take uh cases related to
 
01:45:38.870 --> 01:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
land use and concentrate them it is not
 
01:45:42.850 --> 01:45:42.860 align:start position:0%
our uh responsibility
 
01:45:45.350 --> 01:45:45.360 align:start position:0%
we don't have to deal
 
01:45:47.870 --> 01:45:47.880 align:start position:0%
with whether or not there is enough
 
01:45:50.330 --> 01:45:50.340 align:start position:0%
money for this we are establishing the
 
01:45:53.450 --> 01:45:53.460 align:start position:0%
policy it then goes to finance and the
 
01:45:55.070 --> 01:45:55.080 align:start position:0%
finance committee will tell you they
 
01:45:57.530 --> 01:45:57.540 align:start position:0%
don't do anything about policy all they
 
01:45:59.510 --> 01:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
do is the money and if you believe that
 
01:46:02.870 --> 01:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
I have a bridge to sell you thank you so
 
01:46:05.570 --> 01:46:05.580 align:start position:0%
you know just just one final point I
 
01:46:08.450 --> 01:46:08.460 align:start position:0%
would make on this uh um I think it's
 
01:46:11.209 --> 01:46:11.219 align:start position:0%
really important to understand
 
01:46:11.219 --> 01:46:13.250 align:start position:0%
really important to understand
that

01:46:13.250 --> 01:46:13.260 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:46:15.169 --> 01:46:15.179 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:46:18.050 --> 01:46:18.060 align:start position:0%
just like the housing appeals board Bill
 
01:46:19.669 --> 01:46:19.679 align:start position:0%
and that bill that housing appeals board
 
01:46:21.770 --> 01:46:21.780 align:start position:0%
has been in effect for for several years
 
01:46:26.090 --> 01:46:26.100 align:start position:0%
now it makes no substantive changes to
 
01:46:28.430 --> 01:46:28.440 align:start position:0%
the law of land use the law doesn't
 
01:46:32.090 --> 01:46:32.100 align:start position:0%
change at all by this bill or by the
 
01:46:33.590 --> 01:46:33.600 align:start position:0%
housing appeals board Bill the
 
01:46:36.109 --> 01:46:36.119 align:start position:0%
substantive law of where you can build
 
01:46:38.330 --> 01:46:38.340 align:start position:0%
what you can build how much what what
 
01:46:40.310 --> 01:46:40.320 align:start position:0%
kind of a setback you have to have how
 
01:46:42.950 --> 01:46:42.960 align:start position:0%
many units you can have all that
 
01:46:44.870 --> 01:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
neither the housing appeals board nor
 
01:46:47.570 --> 01:46:47.580 align:start position:0%
this bill makes any change to that so
 
01:46:50.209 --> 01:46:50.219 align:start position:0%
that you know I I the the comment I made
 
01:46:52.970 --> 01:46:52.980 align:start position:0%
before I think really is important is
 
01:46:57.530 --> 01:46:57.540 align:start position:0%
it this bill says it's a good idea to
 
01:46:59.390 --> 01:46:59.400 align:start position:0%
have a judge that's going to decide
 
01:47:01.370 --> 01:47:01.380 align:start position:0%
those things be a judge who has some
 
01:47:03.470 --> 01:47:03.480 align:start position:0%
knowledge in that area as opposed to
 
01:47:05.330 --> 01:47:05.340 align:start position:0%
just you know you pick a judge out of
 
01:47:07.669 --> 01:47:07.679 align:start position:0%
the out of the rotation so to speak who
 
01:47:09.470 --> 01:47:09.480 align:start position:0%
may have some knowledge we have I'm not
 
01:47:10.729 --> 01:47:10.739 align:start position:0%
saying that no Superior Court judges
 
01:47:12.229 --> 01:47:12.239 align:start position:0%
have knowledge in this area they do them
 
01:47:14.149 --> 01:47:14.159 align:start position:0%
now and so you know they have some
 
01:47:16.430 --> 01:47:16.440 align:start position:0%
knowledge but uh most of them probably
 
01:47:17.870 --> 01:47:17.880 align:start position:0%
are not expertise I don't have any
 
01:47:19.910 --> 01:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
expertise in this particular area
 
01:47:21.770 --> 01:47:21.780 align:start position:0%
this says we would have a judge that
 
01:47:23.450 --> 01:47:23.460 align:start position:0%
does have that expertisement yes
 
01:47:25.370 --> 01:47:25.380 align:start position:0%
representative Oregon um but also isn't
 
01:47:28.010 --> 01:47:28.020 align:start position:0%
part of the rationale that this speeds
 
01:47:30.410 --> 01:47:30.420 align:start position:0%
up these cases so oh exactly yeah see
 
01:47:32.930 --> 01:47:32.940 align:start position:0%
you know like whether this development
 
01:47:34.729 --> 01:47:34.739 align:start position:0%
proposal is going to fly or not uh
 
01:47:37.430 --> 01:47:37.440 align:start position:0%
sooner that no that's yeah absolutely
 
01:47:39.470 --> 01:47:39.480 align:start position:0%
not necessarily soon but sooner it's
 
01:47:41.570 --> 01:47:41.580 align:start position:0%
right an excellent point other yes
 
01:47:44.030 --> 01:47:44.040 align:start position:0%
representative kuta
 
01:47:46.729 --> 01:47:46.739 align:start position:0%
I have the utmost respect for for our
 
01:47:46.739 --> 01:47:48.050 align:start position:0%
I have the utmost respect for for our
chairman

01:47:48.050 --> 01:47:48.060 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:47:50.570 --> 01:47:50.580 align:start position:0%
um but I also deeply value the opinions
 
01:47:53.510 --> 01:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
of of my constituents and the only
 
01:47:56.330 --> 01:47:56.340 align:start position:0%
constituents I've heard from had a lot
 
01:47:59.390 --> 01:47:59.400 align:start position:0%
of concerns about this and so that's the
 
01:48:01.850 --> 01:48:01.860 align:start position:0%
reason for my vote and uh just wanted to
 
01:48:03.050 --> 01:48:03.060 align:start position:0%
state that
 
01:48:05.930 --> 01:48:05.940 align:start position:0%
uh yes representative Perez I apologize
 
01:48:05.940 --> 01:48:07.310 align:start position:0%
uh yes representative Perez I apologize
but

01:48:07.310 --> 01:48:07.320 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:48:10.669 --> 01:48:10.679 align:start position:0%
there are 21 Superior Court Justices now
 
01:48:12.830 --> 01:48:12.840 align:start position:0%
correct how long have do you know how
 
01:48:15.050 --> 01:48:15.060 align:start position:0%
long that's been the established number
 
01:48:18.350 --> 01:48:18.360 align:start position:0%
roughly it's been that way for a uh you
 
01:48:20.390 --> 01:48:20.400 align:start position:0%
know it's when I first when I first went
 
01:48:24.350 --> 01:48:24.360 align:start position:0%
on the court and in 1992 there were 29 I
 
01:48:26.990 --> 01:48:27.000 align:start position:0%
was I became number 29. and that was but
 
01:48:28.490 --> 01:48:28.500 align:start position:0%
then we had we there was no Family
 
01:48:30.229 --> 01:48:30.239 align:start position:0%
Division then we handled the Superior
 
01:48:32.149 --> 01:48:32.159 align:start position:0%
Court handle family cases then when the
 
01:48:34.370 --> 01:48:34.380 align:start position:0%
Family Division was established the
 
01:48:35.870 --> 01:48:35.880 align:start position:0%
number of Superior Court judges went
 
01:48:39.169 --> 01:48:39.179 align:start position:0%
down significantly and it has it has
 
01:48:40.970 --> 01:48:40.980 align:start position:0%
sort of come up
 
01:48:43.609 --> 01:48:43.619 align:start position:0%
rather slowly since then so it's back to
 
01:48:45.770 --> 01:48:45.780 align:start position:0%
now 21.
 
01:48:48.189 --> 01:48:48.199 align:start position:0%
representative Tripp
 
01:48:49.910 --> 01:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:48:52.430 --> 01:48:52.440 align:start position:0%
you know uh it seems that a lot of
 
01:48:55.370 --> 01:48:55.380 align:start position:0%
people on this committee seem to think
 
01:48:57.410 --> 01:48:57.420 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
01:48:57.420 --> 01:48:58.790 align:start position:0%
that uh
the uh

01:48:58.790 --> 01:48:58.800 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
01:49:00.310 --> 01:49:00.320 align:start position:0%
land use
 
01:49:05.149 --> 01:49:05.159 align:start position:0%
docket is only going to overturn the uh
 
01:49:08.750 --> 01:49:08.760 align:start position:0%
the the local land use boards decisions
 
01:49:11.390 --> 01:49:11.400 align:start position:0%
you know I don't think that's entirely
 
01:49:13.910 --> 01:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
correct I think that you probably find
 
01:49:15.709 --> 01:49:15.719 align:start position:0%
that a lot of the land use the local
 
01:49:19.370 --> 01:49:19.380 align:start position:0%
land use boards decisions are upheld you
 
01:49:22.490 --> 01:49:22.500 align:start position:0%
know and uh the uh the local land use
 
01:49:24.169 --> 01:49:24.179 align:start position:0%
boards are interested in moving things
 
01:49:26.870 --> 01:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
along too so
 
01:49:28.790 --> 01:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
that's why I believe this is a good bill
 
01:49:32.330 --> 01:49:32.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:34.970 --> 01:49:34.980 align:start position:0%
any other comments all right are we
 
01:49:37.850 --> 01:49:37.860 align:start position:0%

um pretty simple uh this is going to add
 
01:51:24.950 --> 01:51:24.960 align:start position:0%
a lot of Regulation to uh Real Estate
 
01:51:26.750 --> 01:51:26.760 align:start position:0%
Investors and whatnot
 
01:51:29.990 --> 01:51:30.000 align:start position:0%

whatnot uh people hold their real estate
 
01:51:42.950 --> 01:51:42.960 align:start position:0%

01:51:44.990 --> 01:51:45.000 align:start position:0%
complicate things and uh just not what

thank you Mr chair uh
 
01:53:47.870 --> 01:53:47.880 align:start position:0%
in all of the discussions and all of the
 
01:53:49.910 --> 01:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
landlord tenant bills that we have heard
 
01:53:54.350 --> 01:53:54.360 align:start position:0%
so far the biggest uh issue has been
 
01:53:57.129 --> 01:53:57.139 align:start position:0%
really in Communications
 
01:54:02.330 --> 01:54:02.340 align:start position:0%
and this bill uh in particular in its
 
01:54:05.090 --> 01:54:05.100 align:start position:0%
original form had way too many things to
 
01:54:08.649 --> 01:54:08.659 align:start position:0%
to that I could not agree to however
 
01:54:11.510 --> 01:54:11.520 align:start position:0%
uh an amendment this is what this
 
01:54:14.450 --> 01:54:14.460 align:start position:0%
amendment does is just simply put in the
 
01:54:16.729 --> 01:54:16.739 align:start position:0%
eviction notice
 
01:54:20.270 --> 01:54:20.280 align:start position:0%
that the tenant may contact the New
 
01:54:21.950 --> 01:54:21.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire legal assistance for Council
 
01:54:25.970 --> 01:54:25.980 align:start position:0%
that they may be may be eligible for uh
 
01:54:27.410 --> 01:54:27.420 align:start position:0%
for legal counsel through the New
 
01:54:29.930 --> 01:54:29.940 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh legal assistance uh there's
 
01:54:32.270 --> 01:54:32.280 align:start position:0%
no uh and then of course a statement
 
01:54:34.310 --> 01:54:34.320 align:start position:0%
that says by calling whatever the phone
 
01:54:35.810 --> 01:54:35.820 align:start position:0%
number happens to be it would be similar
 
01:54:38.390 --> 01:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
to uh if you're addicted to gambling you
 
01:54:40.310 --> 01:54:40.320 align:start position:0%
know all you hear all the disclaimers uh
 
01:54:41.689 --> 01:54:41.699 align:start position:0%
for the lottery and stuff like that if
 
01:54:43.189 --> 01:54:43.199 align:start position:0%
you're addicted to gambling call 1-800
 
01:54:44.510 --> 01:54:44.520 align:start position:0%
I'm addicted or whatever the number
 
01:54:47.270 --> 01:54:47.280 align:start position:0%
happens to be or akin to the suicide
 
01:54:49.490 --> 01:54:49.500 align:start position:0%
hotline on the back of a student ID card
 
01:54:51.229 --> 01:54:51.239 align:start position:0%
things along those lines so it's just
 
01:54:53.870 --> 01:54:53.880 align:start position:0%
informing the tenant that they may be
 
01:54:57.649 --> 01:54:57.659 align:start position:0%
eligible for legal assistance
 
01:55:00.709 --> 01:55:00.719 align:start position:0%
you know uh you know uh representative
 
01:55:04.430 --> 01:55:04.440 align:start position:0%
greeson I you know I I my only concern I
 
01:55:07.010 --> 01:55:07.020 align:start position:0%
thought that what what when when we had
 
01:55:08.990 --> 01:55:09.000 align:start position:0%
talked about this um
 
01:55:11.450 --> 01:55:11.460 align:start position:0%
that that
 
01:55:14.209 --> 01:55:14.219 align:start position:0%
um you had that that the that the
 
01:55:16.430 --> 01:55:16.440 align:start position:0%
amendment said something about the
 
01:55:17.750 --> 01:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
eviction notice you'll clearly state
 
01:55:21.830 --> 01:55:21.840 align:start position:0%
that the tenant may be entitled I'm
 
01:55:23.530 --> 01:55:23.540 align:start position:0%
sorry uh
 
01:55:26.270 --> 01:55:26.280 align:start position:0%
yeah may be entitled to New Hampshire
 
01:55:28.310 --> 01:55:28.320 align:start position:0%
legal assistance I guess I'm what I'm
 
01:55:30.050 --> 01:55:30.060 align:start position:0%
concerned about is it doesn't quite say
 
01:55:32.930 --> 01:55:32.940 align:start position:0%
that it sort of says may contact New
 
01:55:35.209 --> 01:55:35.219 align:start position:0%
Hampshire legal assistance and I my only
 
01:55:37.490 --> 01:55:37.500 align:start position:0%
question is have we
 
01:55:40.430 --> 01:55:40.440 align:start position:0%
is this in any way
 
01:55:43.430 --> 01:55:43.440 align:start position:0%
you know sending an un sort of an unfair
 
01:55:46.250 --> 01:55:46.260 align:start position:0%
signal to a prospective tenant that they
 
01:55:48.830 --> 01:55:48.840 align:start position:0%
have a some kind of a right to counsel
 
01:55:51.590 --> 01:55:51.600 align:start position:0%
I'm not because I assume none of us I I
 
01:55:53.870 --> 01:55:53.880 align:start position:0%
assume you did not mean to say that they
 
01:55:56.510 --> 01:55:56.520 align:start position:0%
have a right to happen no they they this
 
01:55:58.790 --> 01:55:58.800 align:start position:0%
is not this is not conveying a
 
01:56:00.649 --> 01:56:00.659 align:start position:0%
particular right to council but that
 
01:56:03.050 --> 01:56:03.060 align:start position:0%
they may contact uh New Hampshire legal
 
01:56:05.209 --> 01:56:05.219 align:start position:0%
assistance if they if they're eligible
 
01:56:06.770 --> 01:56:06.780 align:start position:0%
if they're qualified I don't know what
 
01:56:08.930 --> 01:56:08.940 align:start position:0%
the requirements are I don't know who
 
01:56:11.629 --> 01:56:11.639 align:start position:0%
can and cannot use it what the you know
 
01:56:13.250 --> 01:56:13.260 align:start position:0%
what any Financial requirements or
 
01:56:15.109 --> 01:56:15.119 align:start position:0%
anything along those lines it's just
 
01:56:17.390 --> 01:56:17.400 align:start position:0%
merely saying that they may contact them
 
01:56:19.790 --> 01:56:19.800 align:start position:0%
after that that's the only obligation is
 
01:56:21.290 --> 01:56:21.300 align:start position:0%
just the statement in the eviction
 
01:56:23.750 --> 01:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
notice and if the tenant then decides to
 
01:56:26.870 --> 01:56:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:29.510 --> 01:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
Dr representative Alexander what's uh
 
01:56:31.250 --> 01:56:31.260 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if you have any
 
01:56:34.250 --> 01:56:34.260 align:start position:0%
since you are uh on this housing
 
01:56:36.830 --> 01:56:36.840 align:start position:0%
community if you have any view on this
 
01:56:38.689 --> 01:56:38.699 align:start position:0%
well I would also refer to my friend
 
01:56:41.510 --> 01:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
representative Delorenzo but um I
 
01:56:44.209 --> 01:56:44.219 align:start position:0%
I think this bill was um a mess to begin
 
01:56:47.450 --> 01:56:47.460 align:start position:0%
with but I think that this is a simple I
 
01:56:49.910 --> 01:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
think this is a simple Amendment
 
01:56:49.920 --> 01:56:50.450 align:start position:0%
think this is a simple Amendment
um

01:56:50.450 --> 01:56:50.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:52.609 --> 01:56:52.619 align:start position:0%
that I think is a very very very very
 
01:56:54.950 --> 01:56:54.960 align:start position:0%
very very small bite of the Apple
 
01:56:57.590 --> 01:56:57.600 align:start position:0%
so let me just ask it's so
 
01:56:59.810 --> 01:56:59.820 align:start position:0%
um my unders I'm sorry representative
 
01:57:02.209 --> 01:57:02.219 align:start position:0%
Lorenzo yeah thank you Mr chair
 
01:57:05.390 --> 01:57:05.400 align:start position:0%
um I think the purpose of the um
 
01:57:07.189 --> 01:57:07.199 align:start position:0%
amendment is is great
 
01:57:08.930 --> 01:57:08.940 align:start position:0%
um so I think of it as sort of like a
 
01:57:11.209 --> 01:57:11.219 align:start position:0%
public service announcement but I I
 
01:57:12.830 --> 01:57:12.840 align:start position:0%
would like to see that language
 
01:57:15.410 --> 01:57:15.420 align:start position:0%
tightened up a little bit
 
01:57:17.990 --> 01:57:18.000 align:start position:0%
I could take out the word guidance okay
 
01:57:20.270 --> 01:57:20.280 align:start position:0%
Mr chair are we allowed to hold off on
 
01:57:21.890 --> 01:57:21.900 align:start position:0%
this and maybe pardon are we allowed to
 
01:57:23.270 --> 01:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
hold off on this this is not an early
 
01:57:25.910 --> 01:57:25.920 align:start position:0%
built grid this is not uh well no it is
 
01:57:27.229 --> 01:57:27.239 align:start position:0%
an early Bill I'm sorry it is an early
 
01:57:29.810 --> 01:57:29.820 align:start position:0%
Bill 379 is an early bill
 
01:57:31.910 --> 01:57:31.920 align:start position:0%
um so let me just say this I guess what
 
01:57:34.970 --> 01:57:34.980 align:start position:0%
I would say is yes representative Smith
 
01:57:37.189 --> 01:57:37.199 align:start position:0%
Mr chair isn't it an early bill because
 
01:57:41.689 --> 01:57:41.699 align:start position:0%
of the original language in the bill and
 
01:57:44.689 --> 01:57:44.699 align:start position:0%
all of that line was relating to
 
01:57:47.990 --> 01:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
um Finance has been removed
 
01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:53.350 align:start position:0%
um Finance has been removed
um

01:57:53.350 --> 01:57:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:57.109 --> 01:57:57.119 align:start position:0%
if the um
 
01:57:59.990 --> 01:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
so if
 
01:58:01.970 --> 01:58:01.980 align:start position:0%
yeah you know my only concern would be
 
01:58:04.970 --> 01:58:04.980 align:start position:0%
suppose if we let's suppose that we put
 
01:58:07.669 --> 01:58:07.679 align:start position:0%
it off and we and and some at the end we
 
01:58:10.609 --> 01:58:10.619 align:start position:0%
we didn't adopt this amendment then that
 
01:58:12.709 --> 01:58:12.719 align:start position:0%
would leave the original bill
 
01:58:15.470 --> 01:58:15.480 align:start position:0%
which does have that time limitation
 
01:58:18.350 --> 01:58:18.360 align:start position:0%
that's that's my concern
 
01:58:18.360 --> 01:58:19.310 align:start position:0%
that's that's my concern
um

01:58:19.310 --> 01:58:19.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:22.490 --> 01:58:22.500 align:start position:0%
I think it's legitimate concern
 
01:58:24.290 --> 01:58:24.300 align:start position:0%
I don't think there's any possibility
 
01:58:28.609 --> 01:58:28.619 align:start position:0%
that the original bill would pass I well
 
01:58:29.990 --> 01:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
you know what let me ask let me you know
 
01:58:32.689 --> 01:58:32.699 align:start position:0%
let me just ask this this question
 
01:58:35.870 --> 01:58:35.880 align:start position:0%
maybe I'm you know maybe this is this is
 
01:58:38.930 --> 01:58:38.940 align:start position:0%
the lawyer being overly picky about some
 
01:58:41.870 --> 01:58:41.880 align:start position:0%
language Let me just ask you this I
 
01:58:41.880 --> 01:58:43.669 align:start position:0%
language Let me just ask you this I
huh

01:58:43.669 --> 01:58:43.679 align:start position:0%
huh
 
01:58:48.229 --> 01:58:48.239 align:start position:0%
I'm I understand representative greeson
 
01:58:52.609 --> 01:58:52.619 align:start position:0%
um to say that it that this language is
 
01:58:54.950 --> 01:58:54.960 align:start position:0%
not in any way intended to suggest that
 
01:58:58.490 --> 01:58:58.500 align:start position:0%
that uh uh tenant facing eviction has
 
01:59:01.250 --> 01:59:01.260 align:start position:0%
some right to an attorney from Legal
 
01:59:04.570 --> 01:59:04.580 align:start position:0%
Assistance or otherwise uh or or or even
 
01:59:06.589 --> 01:59:06.599 align:start position:0%
eligibility they may be eligible they
 
01:59:08.030 --> 01:59:08.040 align:start position:0%
may not
 
01:59:08.040 --> 01:59:09.530 align:start position:0%
may not
um

01:59:09.530 --> 01:59:09.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:12.410 --> 01:59:12.420 align:start position:0%
I can accept that understanding and if I
 
01:59:14.149 --> 01:59:14.159 align:start position:0%
guess what I would say is if does
 
01:59:15.890 --> 01:59:15.900 align:start position:0%
everyone else in the on the committee
 
01:59:17.750 --> 01:59:17.760 align:start position:0%
agree that this is not in any way
 
01:59:20.689 --> 01:59:20.699 align:start position:0%
intended to create some right to an
 
01:59:24.410 --> 01:59:24.420 align:start position:0%
attorney uh that doesn't already exist
 
01:59:26.209 --> 01:59:26.219 align:start position:0%
um Mr chair
 
01:59:28.790 --> 01:59:28.800 align:start position:0%
um I agree that it does not create a
 
01:59:30.770 --> 01:59:30.780 align:start position:0%
right but I'm also thinking of the
 
01:59:35.089 --> 01:59:35.099 align:start position:0%
calendar we have already scheduled
 
01:59:35.099 --> 01:59:35.990 align:start position:0%
calendar we have already scheduled
um

01:59:35.990 --> 01:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:38.750 --> 01:59:38.760 align:start position:0%
uh an executive session for next
 
01:59:41.870 --> 01:59:41.880 align:start position:0%
Wednesday it today is Wednesday isn't it
 
01:59:46.370 --> 01:59:46.380 align:start position:0%
all day it's before noon we can add to
 
01:59:48.709 --> 01:59:48.719 align:start position:0%
next Wednesdays
 
01:59:48.719 --> 01:59:49.990 align:start position:0%
next Wednesdays
um

01:59:49.990 --> 01:59:50.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:53.330 --> 01:59:53.340 align:start position:0%
uh executive session if you really feel
 
01:59:55.250 --> 01:59:55.260 align:start position:0%
that you want another amendment we could
 
01:59:57.109 --> 01:59:57.119 align:start position:0%
add it to next Wednesday's schedule take
 
01:59:59.450 --> 01:59:59.460 align:start position:0%
it up first thing
 
02:00:00.950 --> 02:00:00.960 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:00:03.830 --> 02:00:03.840 align:start position:0%
um and I think that would that might I
 
02:00:05.570 --> 02:00:05.580 align:start position:0%
don't think it's necessary
 
02:00:08.570 --> 02:00:08.580 align:start position:0%
um and I think you might want to
 
02:00:10.129 --> 02:00:10.139 align:start position:0%
remember that this is the legislative
 
02:00:13.729 --> 02:00:13.739 align:start position:0%
branch not the judicial branch but um if
 
02:00:16.430 --> 02:00:16.440 align:start position:0%
if for some reason you have a problem I
 
02:00:18.950 --> 02:00:18.960 align:start position:0%
just don't see why we can't go at go
 
02:00:21.890 --> 02:00:21.900 align:start position:0%
ahead with this all right representative
 
02:00:23.629 --> 02:00:23.639 align:start position:0%
when I did my clerk training it was
 
02:00:25.970 --> 02:00:25.980 align:start position:0%
mentioned that during situations like
 
02:00:28.129 --> 02:00:28.139 align:start position:0%
this if somebody's willing to run down
 
02:00:30.229 --> 02:00:30.239 align:start position:0%
to OLS sometimes they can fix this right
 
02:00:31.970 --> 02:00:31.980 align:start position:0%
up immediately and give us an amendment
 
02:00:33.530 --> 02:00:33.540 align:start position:0%
and then we could vote on it so maybe
 
02:00:35.089 --> 02:00:35.099 align:start position:0%
perhaps we could
 
02:00:37.370 --> 02:00:37.380 align:start position:0%
you know recess this for a few minutes
 
02:00:40.310 --> 02:00:40.320 align:start position:0%
and and maybe rep reads since she's here
 
02:00:43.070 --> 02:00:43.080 align:start position:0%
might be willing to run on down for us
 
02:00:43.080 --> 02:00:44.270 align:start position:0%
might be willing to run on down for us
that

02:00:44.270 --> 02:00:44.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:00:46.310 --> 02:00:46.320 align:start position:0%
that sounds that sounds like a very good
 
02:00:49.129 --> 02:00:49.139 align:start position:0%
idea excellent I I think if that's
 
02:00:51.290 --> 02:00:51.300 align:start position:0%
possible and totally okay but I also
 
02:00:53.330 --> 02:00:53.340 align:start position:0%
don't think it's needed because eviction
 
02:00:55.550 --> 02:00:55.560 align:start position:0%
notices don't appear in the RSA as is
 
02:00:56.810 --> 02:00:56.820 align:start position:0%
it's always left to the courts to
 
02:00:58.609 --> 02:00:58.619 align:start position:0%
determine how they put it on the
 
02:01:00.950 --> 02:01:00.960 align:start position:0%
eviction notice so all this is I think
 
02:01:02.629 --> 02:01:02.639 align:start position:0%
all this we need to adopt the amendment
 
02:01:04.310 --> 02:01:04.320 align:start position:0%
but once the amendment's adopted we
 
02:01:06.410 --> 02:01:06.420 align:start position:0%
leave it to the courts to to make that
 
02:01:07.729 --> 02:01:07.739 align:start position:0%
decision on what goes on the eviction
 
02:01:09.470 --> 02:01:09.480 align:start position:0%
notice anyways and that's typically been
 
02:01:11.689 --> 02:01:11.699 align:start position:0%
the procedure for all of this stuff no I
 
02:01:13.609 --> 02:01:13.619 align:start position:0%
mean well that's true but I guess my
 
02:01:16.790 --> 02:01:16.800 align:start position:0%
concern is that this this statute will
 
02:01:19.189 --> 02:01:19.199 align:start position:0%
be in the law I mean it will that it
 
02:01:20.990 --> 02:01:21.000 align:start position:0%
will be on the books so yes
 
02:01:24.530 --> 02:01:24.540 align:start position:0%
representative Warren um thank you I
 
02:01:27.470 --> 02:01:27.480 align:start position:0%
I I think I think even if we pass
 
02:01:29.689 --> 02:01:29.699 align:start position:0%
something like this that wouldn't have
 
02:01:32.030 --> 02:01:32.040 align:start position:0%
been a uh early bill
 
02:01:34.010 --> 02:01:34.020 align:start position:0%
if we passed it originally I think we
 
02:01:35.810 --> 02:01:35.820 align:start position:0%
now still have to send it to finance I
 
02:01:38.089 --> 02:01:38.099 align:start position:0%
speak from uh a personal experience I
 
02:01:41.209 --> 02:01:41.219 align:start position:0%
had of course that was 2020 during the
 
02:01:42.589 --> 02:01:42.599 align:start position:0%
pandemic hit during the middle of the
 
02:01:44.149 --> 02:01:44.159 align:start position:0%
process so everything was a little bit
 
02:01:47.089 --> 02:01:47.099 align:start position:0%
topsy-turvy but I had a education that
 
02:01:49.189 --> 02:01:49.199 align:start position:0%
would have cost a significant amount of
 
02:01:51.530 --> 02:01:51.540 align:start position:0%
money hence was an early Bill and would
 
02:01:53.750 --> 02:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
have gone to finance but they turned
 
02:01:55.850 --> 02:01:55.860 align:start position:0%
into a study committee but it still uh
 
02:01:57.890 --> 02:01:57.900 align:start position:0%
got hurt by Finance although I guess the
 
02:01:59.810 --> 02:01:59.820 align:start position:0%
finance chair could have waived the
 
02:02:01.370 --> 02:02:01.380 align:start position:0%
reference and then just sent it straight
 
02:02:02.510 --> 02:02:02.520 align:start position:0%
on to the
 
02:02:04.310 --> 02:02:04.320 align:start position:0%
body on the other side of the wall we're
 
02:02:06.890 --> 02:02:06.900 align:start position:0%
not allowed to talk about but um I think
 
02:02:08.510 --> 02:02:08.520 align:start position:0%
we still have I think regardless of
 
02:02:09.890 --> 02:02:09.900 align:start position:0%
whether or not there's a fiscal impact
 
02:02:11.689 --> 02:02:11.699 align:start position:0%
we still have to like meet the deadline
 
02:02:13.430 --> 02:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
for the early Bill and it still at least
 
02:02:16.370 --> 02:02:16.380 align:start position:0%
might have to go to finance thanks if I
 
02:02:18.050 --> 02:02:18.060 align:start position:0%
could just add one more thing Mr chair
 
02:02:20.689 --> 02:02:20.699 align:start position:0%
if we could accept this maybe I'm just
 
02:02:21.830 --> 02:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
trying to keep
 
02:02:24.470 --> 02:02:24.480 align:start position:0%
adopt the kiss principle which my
 
02:02:27.229 --> 02:02:27.239 align:start position:0%
children keep on trying you know kept on
 
02:02:29.149 --> 02:02:29.159 align:start position:0%
trying to tell me to do I never agreed
 
02:02:29.159 --> 02:02:30.410 align:start position:0%
trying to tell me to do I never agreed
but

02:02:30.410 --> 02:02:30.420 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:02:31.990 --> 02:02:32.000 align:start position:0%
um in this case
 
02:02:35.089 --> 02:02:35.099 align:start position:0%
we know that the bill would appear has
 
02:02:38.209 --> 02:02:38.219 align:start position:0%
to go to finance and
 
02:02:40.910 --> 02:02:40.920 align:start position:0%
Finance might refuse it which would be
 
02:02:43.189 --> 02:02:43.199 align:start position:0%
great it would then go to the Senate and
 
02:02:45.589 --> 02:02:45.599 align:start position:0%
if we need to fine-tune something we can
 
02:02:48.229 --> 02:02:48.239 align:start position:0%
fine tune it in the Senate Mr
 
02:02:49.970 --> 02:02:49.980 align:start position:0%
representative breeson could go to the
 
02:02:52.250 --> 02:02:52.260 align:start position:0%
Senate and say you might want to clarify
 
02:02:55.250 --> 02:02:55.260 align:start position:0%
this this language so so
 
02:02:55.260 --> 02:02:55.850 align:start position:0%
this this language so so
um

02:02:55.850 --> 02:02:55.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:59.450 --> 02:02:59.460 align:start position:0%
I would urge us to accept this amendment
 
02:03:04.010 --> 02:03:04.020 align:start position:0%
if it passes and accept the bill keep it
 
02:03:06.830 --> 02:03:06.840 align:start position:0%
on the schedule that it's on perhaps
 
02:03:09.770 --> 02:03:09.780 align:start position:0%
suggest to a representative will that he
 
02:03:11.629 --> 02:03:11.639 align:start position:0%
really doesn't want this bill but if he
 
02:03:14.450 --> 02:03:14.460 align:start position:0%
does he'll take it and then eventually
 
02:03:16.310 --> 02:03:16.320 align:start position:0%
it would end up in the Senate and so
 
02:03:18.830 --> 02:03:18.840 align:start position:0%
there are lots of opportunities
 
02:03:18.840 --> 02:03:19.790 align:start position:0%
there are lots of opportunities
um

02:03:19.790 --> 02:03:19.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:23.149 --> 02:03:23.159 align:start position:0%
uh to fine tune it and there's even one
 
02:03:24.890 --> 02:03:24.900 align:start position:0%
more and that is that the committee
 
02:03:28.669 --> 02:03:28.679 align:start position:0%
could suggest a floor Amendment
 
02:03:28.679 --> 02:03:29.330 align:start position:0%
could suggest a floor Amendment
um

02:03:29.330 --> 02:03:29.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:32.089 --> 02:03:32.099 align:start position:0%
uh if we feel that we want to between
 
02:03:33.830 --> 02:03:33.840 align:start position:0%
now and when it gets to the floor if we
 
02:03:35.990 --> 02:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
want to tighten the language so I would
 
02:03:38.870 --> 02:03:38.880 align:start position:0%
urge us to go ahead now get it off our
 
02:03:41.390 --> 02:03:41.400 align:start position:0%
books we have so many other bills that
 
02:03:43.790 --> 02:03:43.800 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with and we have lots of
 
02:03:45.169 --> 02:03:45.179 align:start position:0%
opportunities we have the finance
 
02:03:46.729 --> 02:03:46.739 align:start position:0%
committee now first we have the floor
 
02:03:48.350 --> 02:03:48.360 align:start position:0%
Amendment we have a finance committee
 
02:03:50.270 --> 02:03:50.280 align:start position:0%
and we have the Senate if we need to
 
02:03:51.770 --> 02:03:51.780 align:start position:0%
fine tune it anymore
 
02:03:55.609 --> 02:03:55.619 align:start position:0%
may I yes representative puta in light
 
02:03:56.870 --> 02:03:56.880 align:start position:0%
of the fact that we still have two more
 
02:03:58.790 --> 02:03:58.800 align:start position:0%
bills I'm wondering if we could just
 
02:04:00.709 --> 02:04:00.719 align:start position:0%
hold off on this for a few minutes and
 
02:04:03.229 --> 02:04:03.239 align:start position:0%
see if if if they could I do agree it is
 
02:04:05.209 --> 02:04:05.219 align:start position:0%
a bit ambiguous and I and I know other
 
02:04:07.070 --> 02:04:07.080 align:start position:0%
committees also have a large number of
 
02:04:08.450 --> 02:04:08.460 align:start position:0%
bills and so I don't want it to get
 
02:04:10.129 --> 02:04:10.139 align:start position:0%
kicked back just because of that if we
 
02:04:11.750 --> 02:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
could just see if it might be possible
 
02:04:13.910 --> 02:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
to change it right now and if it's not
 
02:04:16.729 --> 02:04:16.739 align:start position:0%
then perhaps consider rep Smith's idea
 
02:04:19.250 --> 02:04:19.260 align:start position:0%
so let me just ask let me I think that
 
02:04:20.870 --> 02:04:20.880 align:start position:0%
that makes sense to me let me just ask
 
02:04:25.609 --> 02:04:25.619 align:start position:0%
you this here's what I've what I suggest
 
02:04:28.669 --> 02:04:28.679 align:start position:0%
um in in some quick wordsmithing but I
 
02:04:30.350 --> 02:04:30.360 align:start position:0%
think it accomplishes what at least
 
02:04:32.510 --> 02:04:32.520 align:start position:0%
would satisfy me suppose we change the
 
02:04:34.910 --> 02:04:34.920 align:start position:0%
language starting on line 10 of the
 
02:04:37.550 --> 02:04:37.560 align:start position:0%
amendment so that it would read
 
02:04:40.490 --> 02:04:40.500 align:start position:0%
the eviction notice shall clearly state
 
02:04:44.270 --> 02:04:44.280 align:start position:0%
that an Indigent tenet may be eligible
 
02:04:46.490 --> 02:04:46.500 align:start position:0%
for assistance from New Hampshire legal
 
02:04:50.109 --> 02:04:50.119 align:start position:0%
assistance uh for uh
 
02:04:53.149 --> 02:04:53.159 align:start position:0%
you can take you take out the word uh
 
02:04:55.550 --> 02:04:55.560 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe eligible for assistance from
 
02:04:58.129 --> 02:04:58.139 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire legal assistance
 
02:04:58.139 --> 02:04:59.810 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire legal assistance
um

02:04:59.810 --> 02:04:59.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:02.750 --> 02:05:02.760 align:start position:0%
uh for the eviction proceeding and
 
02:05:04.910 --> 02:05:04.920 align:start position:0%
include instructions on
 
02:05:08.570 --> 02:05:08.580 align:start position:0%
uh the process for obtaining uh such
 
02:05:08.580 --> 02:05:10.010 align:start position:0%
uh the process for obtaining uh such
assistance

02:05:10.010 --> 02:05:10.020 align:start position:0%
assistance
 
02:05:12.530 --> 02:05:12.540 align:start position:0%
or maybe it may be eligible for
 
02:05:13.910 --> 02:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
assistance from New Hampshire legal
 
02:05:13.920 --> 02:05:15.470 align:start position:0%
assistance from New Hampshire legal
assistance

02:05:15.470 --> 02:05:15.480 align:start position:0%
assistance
 
02:05:15.480 --> 02:05:21.589 align:start position:0%
assistance
um

02:05:21.589 --> 02:05:21.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:25.850 --> 02:05:25.860 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:28.129 --> 02:05:28.139 align:start position:0%
suggests that
 
02:05:29.689 --> 02:05:29.699 align:start position:0%
um we
 
02:05:32.330 --> 02:05:32.340 align:start position:0%
um put this bill aside at the moment we
 
02:05:34.490 --> 02:05:34.500 align:start position:0%
asked someone in the room who might be
 
02:05:39.350 --> 02:05:39.360 align:start position:0%
willing to run quickly down to OLS with
 
02:05:41.209 --> 02:05:41.219 align:start position:0%
an amendment that would come in under
 
02:05:43.189 --> 02:05:43.199 align:start position:0%
whose name it can't come in in her name
 
02:05:46.270 --> 02:05:46.280 align:start position:0%
it has to come under Alexander's name
 
02:05:50.750 --> 02:05:50.760 align:start position:0%
and stand there until they actually do
 
02:05:53.209 --> 02:05:53.219 align:start position:0%
it and bring it back to us do you need
 
02:05:55.490 --> 02:05:55.500 align:start position:0%
me to send an email to OLS
 
02:05:57.470 --> 02:05:57.480 align:start position:0%
I'll do that I'll be like do whatever
 
02:05:59.870 --> 02:05:59.880 align:start position:0%
representative Reed says and then we can
 
02:06:01.729 --> 02:06:01.739 align:start position:0%
vote and we can then have two choices
 
02:06:01.739 --> 02:06:02.930 align:start position:0%
vote and we can then have two choices
okay

02:06:02.930 --> 02:06:02.940 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:06:07.129 --> 02:06:07.139 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:09.070 --> 02:06:09.080 align:start position:0%
that's just doing two movies
 
02:06:11.390 --> 02:06:11.400 align:start position:0%
convey any
 
02:06:12.649 --> 02:06:12.659 align:start position:0%
um it can be a Judiciary Community
 
02:06:14.270 --> 02:06:14.280 align:start position:0%
Amendment but if they need a name use
 
02:06:17.990 --> 02:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
Alexander nice so yes
 
02:06:20.990 --> 02:06:21.000 align:start position:0%
hang on hang on wait a minute don't go
 
02:06:23.209 --> 02:06:23.219 align:start position:0%
yet yeah
 
02:06:26.629 --> 02:06:26.639 align:start position:0%
did we take out Part B
 
02:06:30.910 --> 02:06:30.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:34.010 --> 02:06:34.020 align:start position:0%
my other question is during
 
02:06:37.669 --> 02:06:37.679 align:start position:0%
um Judiciary government said it needed
 
02:06:38.870 --> 02:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
structure but the other thing we
 
02:06:41.629 --> 02:06:41.639 align:start position:0%
mentioned during testimony was putting
 
02:06:43.910 --> 02:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
in that they had to do mediation first
 
02:06:47.450 --> 02:06:47.460 align:start position:0%
we talked about that but we've kind of
 
02:06:49.790 --> 02:06:49.800 align:start position:0%
we've tried to kind of let that go if
 
02:06:52.790 --> 02:06:52.800 align:start position:0%
that's any concern
 
02:06:55.550 --> 02:06:55.560 align:start position:0%
I think that wasn't set up for all the
 
02:06:57.350 --> 02:06:57.360 align:start position:0%
counties yet Unfortunately they were
 
02:06:59.450 --> 02:06:59.460 align:start position:0%
trying to expand that yeah thank you all
 
02:07:02.689 --> 02:07:02.699 align:start position:0%
right so representative Reed uh hang on
 
02:07:05.570 --> 02:07:05.580 align:start position:0%

02:07:08.510 --> 02:07:08.520 align:start position:0%
give I'm gonna give you this so let me

is all right with this
 
02:07:14.629 --> 02:07:14.639 align:start position:0%
the eviction notice shall clearly state
 
02:07:17.330 --> 02:07:17.340 align:start position:0%
that an Indigent tenant comma although
 
02:07:20.089 --> 02:07:20.099 align:start position:0%
having no right to counsel comma may be
 
02:07:22.490 --> 02:07:22.500 align:start position:0%
eligible for legal assistance from New
 
02:07:24.410 --> 02:07:24.420 align:start position:0%

02:07:26.450 --> 02:07:26.460 align:start position:0%
eviction and proceeding and include
 
02:07:28.970 --> 02:07:28.980 align:start position:0%

02:07:36.770 --> 02:07:36.780 align:start position:0%
to assistance so you don't have
 
02:07:38.450 --> 02:07:38.460 align:start position:0%
assistance twice
 
02:07:41.149 --> 02:07:41.159 align:start position:0%
is that oh four shoes for sure for such
 
02:07:43.550 --> 02:07:43.560 align:start position:0%

02:07:46.609 --> 02:07:46.619 align:start position:0%

02:07:52.440 --> 02:07:57.189 align:start position:0%
can you leave my chicken scratch all
right

02:07:57.189 --> 02:07:57.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:00.169 --> 02:08:00.179 align:start position:0%
although having no right to counsel may
 
02:08:02.990 --> 02:08:03.000 align:start position:0%
be eligible for representation
 
02:08:05.450 --> 02:08:05.460 align:start position:0%
assistance from New Hampshire legal
 
02:08:35.649 --> 02:08:35.659 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:38.510 --> 02:08:38.520 align:start position:0%
I was just gonna say that I'm hearing it
 
02:08:43.550 --> 02:08:43.560 align:start position:0%
verbally it strikes me as conveying to a
 
02:08:46.250 --> 02:08:46.260 align:start position:0%
tenant an Indigent tenant you have no
 
02:08:48.470 --> 02:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
right but you may be eligible I would
 
02:08:51.530 --> 02:08:51.540 align:start position:0%
rather see it the um although having no
 
02:08:53.390 --> 02:08:53.400 align:start position:0%
right left out and then a final
 
02:08:55.430 --> 02:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
concluding sentence this does not
 
02:09:03.669 --> 02:09:03.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:07.070 --> 02:09:07.080 align:start position:0%
you know what this I've no I I see your
 
02:09:08.629 --> 02:09:08.639 align:start position:0%
point and I might I might even agree
 
02:09:11.270 --> 02:09:11.280 align:start position:0%
with you but we're rather than rather
 
02:09:13.010 --> 02:09:13.020 align:start position:0%
than sort of leave representative Reed
 
02:09:15.410 --> 02:09:15.420 align:start position:0%
dangling uh the more I think about this
 
02:09:16.970 --> 02:09:16.980 align:start position:0%
the more I'm thinking that
 
02:09:18.770 --> 02:09:18.780 align:start position:0%
representative Smith's suggestion that
 
02:09:22.250 --> 02:09:22.260 align:start position:0%
we just put this off uh deal with its
 
02:09:25.970 --> 02:09:25.980 align:start position:0%
first thing on on uh next week as the
 
02:09:28.010 --> 02:09:28.020 align:start position:0%
first item for our agenda for next week
 
02:09:31.189 --> 02:09:31.199 align:start position:0%
will it seems like everybody's sort of
 
02:09:32.750 --> 02:09:32.760 align:start position:0%
on board with the idea that we're gonna
 
02:09:34.430 --> 02:09:34.440 align:start position:0%
we just need to Wordsmith it but
 
02:09:35.810 --> 02:09:35.820 align:start position:0%
everybody's in agreement that we should
 
02:09:37.970 --> 02:09:37.980 align:start position:0%
do it is that is that sort of right yes
 
02:09:40.070 --> 02:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
representative Stapleton I'm not
 
02:09:42.830 --> 02:09:42.840 align:start position:0%
comfortable with has no right to counsel
 
02:09:45.350 --> 02:09:45.360 align:start position:0%
I think that sends a wrong message in
 
02:09:47.450 --> 02:09:47.460 align:start position:0%
Indigent people who don't understand the
 
02:09:50.330 --> 02:09:50.340 align:start position:0%
law uh might feel affronted by that I
 
02:09:51.890 --> 02:09:51.900 align:start position:0%
think you can leave that out and still
 
02:09:53.990 --> 02:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
accomplish it I mean I just wrote down
 
02:09:55.790 --> 02:09:55.800 align:start position:0%
be eligible for assistance from New
 
02:09:58.790 --> 02:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire legal assistance upon request
 
02:10:00.950 --> 02:10:00.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't say who makes the request but
 
02:10:03.169 --> 02:10:03.179 align:start position:0%
makes it simple and direct
 
02:10:05.510 --> 02:10:05.520 align:start position:0%
ing maybe I can't go with the has no
 
02:10:07.370 --> 02:10:07.380 align:start position:0%
right to counsel that does that doesn't
 
02:10:08.629 --> 02:10:08.639 align:start position:0%
sit well
 
02:10:08.639 --> 02:10:10.609 align:start position:0%
sit well
okay

02:10:10.609 --> 02:10:10.619 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:10:12.350 --> 02:10:12.360 align:start position:0%
um all right well then we have I think
 
02:10:17.089 --> 02:10:17.099 align:start position:0%
we I mean my whole my whole purpose
 
02:10:20.209 --> 02:10:20.219 align:start position:0%
for wanting to change the language was a
 
02:10:23.629 --> 02:10:23.639 align:start position:0%
concern that somehow this doesn't
 
02:10:26.030 --> 02:10:26.040 align:start position:0%
you know the the language that's used
 
02:10:26.040 --> 02:10:27.890 align:start position:0%
you know the the language that's used
doesn't

02:10:27.890 --> 02:10:27.900 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
02:10:32.689 --> 02:10:32.699 align:start position:0%
create an argument in some lawyer's mind
 
02:10:34.790 --> 02:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
that oh wait a minute they said in here
 
02:10:38.330 --> 02:10:38.340 align:start position:0%
that you know you're you're uh you have
 
02:10:42.470 --> 02:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
uh the right you have you have you yeah
 
02:10:44.270 --> 02:10:44.280 align:start position:0%
you may be eligible but at least that
 
02:10:46.310 --> 02:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
suggests that they should go there and
 
02:10:47.990 --> 02:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
if they really are Indigent then they
 
02:10:50.750 --> 02:10:50.760 align:start position:0%
are eligible that's I that would be my
 
02:10:53.510 --> 02:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
concern well then you'd have to go to
 
02:10:55.550 --> 02:10:55.560 align:start position:0%
the analysis the first sentence the bill
 
02:10:57.709 --> 02:10:57.719 align:start position:0%
provides that an Indigent tenant shall
 
02:11:00.410 --> 02:11:00.420 align:start position:0%
have the right to counsel
 
02:11:04.550 --> 02:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
so one place we say it they do and and
 
02:11:07.129 --> 02:11:07.139 align:start position:0%
then right this second and then we say
 
02:11:09.109 --> 02:11:09.119 align:start position:0%
no right to counsel I mean both of those
 
02:11:11.950 --> 02:11:11.960 align:start position:0%
have to be reconciled
 
02:11:14.149 --> 02:11:14.159 align:start position:0%
right right the event that the the
 
02:11:16.490 --> 02:11:16.500 align:start position:0%
amendment sort of completely eliminates
 
02:11:16.500 --> 02:11:18.709 align:start position:0%
amendment sort of completely eliminates
379.

02:11:18.709 --> 02:11:18.719 align:start position:0%
379.
 
02:11:21.649 --> 02:11:21.659 align:start position:0%
so I I don't know I as I've heard the
 
02:11:23.930 --> 02:11:23.940 align:start position:0%
discussion I think it we would be in
 
02:11:25.430 --> 02:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
other words
 
02:11:28.250 --> 02:11:28.260 align:start position:0%
I think it would be better to just uh
 
02:11:31.970 --> 02:11:31.980 align:start position:0%
hold off until uh next week and we'll
 
02:11:34.970 --> 02:11:34.980 align:start position:0%
get we'll get some language that that uh
 
02:11:36.890 --> 02:11:36.900 align:start position:0%
we'll get some input from represent yeah
 
02:11:38.450 --> 02:11:38.460 align:start position:0%
I'd rather have you not do that and
 
02:11:40.990 --> 02:11:41.000 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll uh
 
02:11:43.430 --> 02:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
yeah which and you know you know what
 
02:11:45.470 --> 02:11:45.480 align:start position:0%
and I don't have a cut can you can you
 
02:11:47.689 --> 02:11:47.699 align:start position:0%
just make a copy of what I gave you so I
 
02:11:48.649 --> 02:11:48.659 align:start position:0%
get it back because I don't have another
 
02:11:50.149 --> 02:11:50.159 align:start position:0%
copy of it
 
02:11:52.189 --> 02:11:52.199 align:start position:0%
that'd be great
 
02:11:53.510 --> 02:11:53.520 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:11:56.330 --> 02:11:56.340 align:start position:0%
um so I would then propose that we we
 
02:11:58.970 --> 02:11:58.980 align:start position:0%
hold off on
 
02:12:01.609 --> 02:12:01.619 align:start position:0%
this bill until
 
02:12:01.619 --> 02:12:02.209 align:start position:0%
this bill until
um

02:12:02.209 --> 02:12:02.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:12:07.189 --> 02:12:07.199 align:start position:0%
three HB 379 until uh next Wednesday and
 
02:12:10.669 --> 02:12:10.679 align:start position:0%
we'll take it up as the first item
 
02:12:12.470 --> 02:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
next Wednesday
 
02:12:14.149 --> 02:12:14.159 align:start position:0%
great thank you
 
02:12:14.159 --> 02:12:15.910 align:start position:0%
great thank you
um

02:12:15.910 --> 02:12:15.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:12:17.930 --> 02:12:17.940 align:start position:0%
could you tell
 
02:12:17.940 --> 02:12:25.149 align:start position:0%
could you tell
um

02:12:25.149 --> 02:12:25.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:28.250 --> 02:12:28.260 align:start position:0%
uh two h
 
02:12:31.550 --> 02:12:31.560 align:start position:0%
3r and then you know what I think this
 
02:12:33.530 --> 02:12:33.540 align:start position:0%
it might be a good time to just take a
 
02:12:35.810 --> 02:12:35.820 align:start position:0%
like a seventh inning stretch does that
 
02:12:38.510 --> 02:12:38.520 align:start position:0%
sound good for a few minutes
 
02:29:44.150 --> 02:29:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:44.160 --> 02:29:47.530 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:29:47.530 --> 02:29:47.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:49.849 --> 02:29:49.859 align:start position:0%
we're checking
 
02:29:54.349 --> 02:29:54.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:57.410 --> 02:29:57.420 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna call the uh
 
02:30:00.770 --> 02:30:00.780 align:start position:0%
the committee back to order please
 
02:30:00.780 --> 02:30:01.730 align:start position:0%

all right so we left we left off we're
 
02:30:07.969 --> 02:30:07.979 align:start position:0%
gonna we're gonna make some quick
 
02:30:11.510 --> 02:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:13.670 --> 02:30:13.680 align:start position:0%
oh yes we do we need to represent a
 
02:30:13.680 --> 02:30:16.070 align:start position:0%
oh yes we do we need to represent a
testament

02:30:23.150 --> 02:30:23.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:23.160 --> 02:31:06.010 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:31:06.010 --> 02:31:06.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:13.550 --> 02:31:13.560 align:start position:0%

02:31:26.880 --> 02:31:28.250 align:start position:0%
all right
um

02:31:28.250 --> 02:31:28.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:31:30.110 --> 02:31:30.120 align:start position:0%
I think we've got everybody back so um
 
02:31:31.670 --> 02:31:31.680 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna call the committee back to
 
02:31:34.610 --> 02:31:34.620 align:start position:0%
order and and just uh to recap
 
02:31:39.290 --> 02:31:39.300 align:start position:0%
on on uh HB the 379 FN we're going to
 
02:31:41.270 --> 02:31:41.280 align:start position:0%
take that up the first thing uh next
 
02:31:43.550 --> 02:31:43.560 align:start position:0%
Wednesday and uh
 
02:31:46.910 --> 02:31:46.920 align:start position:0%
uh since we're gonna start at 11 o'clock
 
02:31:49.370 --> 02:31:49.380 align:start position:0%
on Wednesday we'll presumably we'll have
 
02:31:52.010 --> 02:31:52.020 align:start position:0%
the language all set to go it will be
 
02:31:55.429 --> 02:31:55.439 align:start position:0%
you know uh we'll we'll go right through
 
02:31:57.770 --> 02:31:57.780 align:start position:0%
it very quickly and get the rep and I'll
 
02:32:01.070 --> 02:32:01.080 align:start position:0%
have a report written by that time so we
 
02:32:04.370 --> 02:32:04.380 align:start position:0%
can just get it uh uh so it goes to you
 
02:32:05.870 --> 02:32:05.880 align:start position:0%
know we don't get over the deadline of
 
02:32:07.490 --> 02:32:07.500 align:start position:0%
getting it in the calendar we'll we'll
 
02:32:09.469 --> 02:32:09.479 align:start position:0%
make that we'll make that happen all
 
02:32:13.010 --> 02:32:13.020 align:start position:0%
right so now I I think we're uh done
 
02:32:15.710 --> 02:32:15.720 align:start position:0%
except for two bills and I'm going to
 
02:32:19.309 --> 02:32:19.319 align:start position:0%
turn to uh HB 254 and recognize
 
02:32:21.770 --> 02:32:21.780 align:start position:0%
representative Wallace for a motion
 
02:32:24.290 --> 02:32:24.300 align:start position:0%
I would move House Bill 254 in Expedia
 
02:32:26.630 --> 02:32:26.640 align:start position:0%
to legislate is there a second I second
 
02:32:28.670 --> 02:32:28.680 align:start position:0%
all right representative Wallace do you
 
02:32:30.889 --> 02:32:30.899 align:start position:0%
wish to speak to uh briefly thank you uh
 
02:32:34.130 --> 02:32:34.140 align:start position:0%
is this bill addresses local uh boards
 
02:32:37.190 --> 02:32:37.200 align:start position:0%
um within a town or a particular
 
02:32:39.889 --> 02:32:39.899 align:start position:0%
District they're by definition they're
 
02:32:41.450 --> 02:32:41.460 align:start position:0%
close by there really shouldn't be any
 
02:32:43.429 --> 02:32:43.439 align:start position:0%
need to do this stuff remotely
 
02:32:43.439 --> 02:32:44.690 align:start position:0%
need to do this stuff remotely
um

02:32:44.690 --> 02:32:44.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:32:46.270 --> 02:32:46.280 align:start position:0%
you know people run for the office
 
02:32:48.170 --> 02:32:48.180 align:start position:0%
knowing there's going to be a bit of a
 
02:32:49.610 --> 02:32:49.620 align:start position:0%
time commitment a couple of days a week
 
02:32:52.849 --> 02:32:52.859 align:start position:0%
in town so let's get to the uh town
 
02:32:54.770 --> 02:32:54.780 align:start position:0%
meeting office and let's get these held
 
02:32:57.170 --> 02:32:57.180 align:start position:0%
in person uh that's the way it needs to
 
02:32:57.950 --> 02:32:57.960 align:start position:0%
be done
 
02:32:59.809 --> 02:32:59.819 align:start position:0%
thank you anyone else wish to be here
 
02:33:01.730 --> 02:33:01.740 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander thank you Mr
 
02:33:03.590 --> 02:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
chair I I would like to point out
 
02:33:05.690 --> 02:33:05.700 align:start position:0%
current RSA uh provides for the ability
 
02:33:07.809 --> 02:33:07.819 align:start position:0%
to attend and vote remotely in special
 
02:33:11.030 --> 02:33:11.040 align:start position:0%
situations for instance in Goffstown we
 
02:33:12.530 --> 02:33:12.540 align:start position:0%
had necessary warrant articles that need
 
02:33:13.910 --> 02:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
to be voted on and we had a selectman
 
02:33:15.710 --> 02:33:15.720 align:start position:0%
that was traveling for business he was
 
02:33:17.389 --> 02:33:17.399 align:start position:0%
allowed to vote remotely so he could
 
02:33:19.370 --> 02:33:19.380 align:start position:0%
have his vote up here on the on the town
 
02:33:19.380 --> 02:33:20.389 align:start position:0%
have his vote up here on the on the town
warrant

02:33:20.389 --> 02:33:20.399 align:start position:0%
warrant
 
02:33:22.550 --> 02:33:22.560 align:start position:0%
um so there's already RSA that provides
 
02:33:25.429 --> 02:33:25.439 align:start position:0%
for situations or provides for this
 
02:33:27.349 --> 02:33:27.359 align:start position:0%
specific situation so this bill is just
 
02:33:28.429 --> 02:33:28.439 align:start position:0%
not needed
 
02:33:31.010 --> 02:33:31.020 align:start position:0%
representative page thank you thank you
 
02:33:32.450 --> 02:33:32.460 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I'll be voting against the
 
02:33:35.630 --> 02:33:35.640 align:start position:0%
motion for itl um and let folks know
 
02:33:37.610 --> 02:33:37.620 align:start position:0%
that I would propose an amendment that I
 
02:33:39.889 --> 02:33:39.899 align:start position:0%
distributed through email and hard copy
 
02:33:42.230 --> 02:33:42.240 align:start position:0%
to this bipartisan bill that I think
 
02:33:44.870 --> 02:33:44.880 align:start position:0%
addresses This concerns that were raised
 
02:33:48.170 --> 02:33:48.180 align:start position:0%
in hearing uh relative to preserving
 
02:33:51.230 --> 02:33:51.240 align:start position:0%
some of the bodies that already do meet
 
02:33:53.870 --> 02:33:53.880 align:start position:0%
or have the option to meet remotely
 
02:33:58.030 --> 02:33:58.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:01.910 --> 02:34:01.920 align:start position:0%
so so that that would be my my position
 
02:34:03.590 --> 02:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
on this that
 
02:34:06.110 --> 02:34:06.120 align:start position:0%
um this you know covid allows public
 
02:34:08.090 --> 02:34:08.100 align:start position:0%
bodies local public bodies to do that
 
02:34:09.650 --> 02:34:09.660 align:start position:0%
we've clarified the term and the
 
02:34:12.889 --> 02:34:12.899 align:start position:0%
amendment to exclude town meeting so I
 
02:34:15.469 --> 02:34:15.479 align:start position:0%
think that I'll be voting against I will
 
02:34:17.389 --> 02:34:17.399 align:start position:0%
be voting against this and through and
 
02:34:18.650 --> 02:34:18.660 align:start position:0%
would like the committee to understand
 
02:34:20.690 --> 02:34:20.700 align:start position:0%
an amendment that I think address the
 
02:34:22.450 --> 02:34:22.460 align:start position:0%
concerns that we heard
 
02:34:25.429 --> 02:34:25.439 align:start position:0%
at hearing so thank you very much anyone
 
02:34:26.929 --> 02:34:26.939 align:start position:0%
else wish to be heard on yes
 
02:34:29.090 --> 02:34:29.100 align:start position:0%
representative Perez
 
02:34:32.510 --> 02:34:32.520 align:start position:0%
does this Inc exclude I know it excludes
 
02:34:34.730 --> 02:34:34.740 align:start position:0%
Town meetings but does it it doesn't
 
02:34:39.170 --> 02:34:39.180 align:start position:0%
exclude school meetings correct because
 
02:34:43.309 --> 02:34:43.319 align:start position:0%
we have a town deliberative and a school
 
02:34:43.319 --> 02:34:45.110 align:start position:0%
we have a town deliberative and a school
deliberative

02:34:45.110 --> 02:34:45.120 align:start position:0%
deliberative
 
02:34:45.120 --> 02:34:45.710 align:start position:0%
deliberative
um

02:34:45.710 --> 02:34:45.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:34:49.910 --> 02:34:49.920 align:start position:0%
and our form of government is separate
 
02:34:53.330 --> 02:34:53.340 align:start position:0%
town from school so therefore I feel
 
02:34:56.150 --> 02:34:56.160 align:start position:0%
concerns that school isn't included in
 
02:34:56.160 --> 02:34:57.730 align:start position:0%
concerns that school isn't included in
this

02:34:57.730 --> 02:34:57.740 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:34:59.929 --> 02:34:59.939 align:start position:0%
representative Smith you I believe you
 
02:35:02.210 --> 02:35:02.220 align:start position:0%
was this I don't want to respond to
 
02:35:04.570 --> 02:35:04.580 align:start position:0%
General Perez's question oh
 
02:35:07.429 --> 02:35:07.439 align:start position:0%
representative page uh if somebody yeah
 
02:35:09.050 --> 02:35:09.060 align:start position:0%
somebody else have a
 
02:35:09.060 --> 02:35:10.070 align:start position:0%
somebody else have a
oh

02:35:10.070 --> 02:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
oh
 
02:35:11.690 --> 02:35:11.700 align:start position:0%
representative testerman I'm sorry did
 
02:35:13.910 --> 02:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
you have some
 
02:35:17.570 --> 02:35:17.580 align:start position:0%
thank you uh I know that we've become
 
02:35:21.190 --> 02:35:21.200 align:start position:0%
quite enamored with uh remote meetings
 
02:35:23.809 --> 02:35:23.819 align:start position:0%
uh at almost every level
 
02:35:26.929 --> 02:35:26.939 align:start position:0%
uh I
 
02:35:30.170 --> 02:35:30.180 align:start position:0%
almost 100 percent don't participate in
 
02:35:33.050 --> 02:35:33.060 align:start position:0%
them because I believe the kind of
 
02:35:35.030 --> 02:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
government that we have here in New
 
02:35:38.690 --> 02:35:38.700 align:start position:0%
England had a requirement to get
 
02:35:41.690 --> 02:35:41.700 align:start position:0%
everybody in attendance that wanted to
 
02:35:41.700 --> 02:35:43.070 align:start position:0%
everybody in attendance that wanted to
participate

02:35:43.070 --> 02:35:43.080 align:start position:0%
participate
 
02:35:45.950 --> 02:35:45.960 align:start position:0%
was the best way to do it and I think
 
02:35:48.290 --> 02:35:48.300 align:start position:0%
now that we were trying just to pick off
 
02:35:51.290 --> 02:35:51.300 align:start position:0%
all these various things onesie twosy
 
02:35:53.870 --> 02:35:53.880 align:start position:0%
and and I'm against it
 
02:35:55.490 --> 02:35:55.500 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
02:35:56.809 --> 02:35:56.819 align:start position:0%
um representative Smith did you wish to
 
02:36:00.250 --> 02:36:00.260 align:start position:0%
speak um yes thank you um
 
02:36:04.429 --> 02:36:04.439 align:start position:0%
I hear what representative
 
02:36:08.150 --> 02:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
testerman says and
 
02:36:08.160 --> 02:36:09.410 align:start position:0%
testerman says and
um

02:36:09.410 --> 02:36:09.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:36:12.770 --> 02:36:12.780 align:start position:0%
and at some levels I'm quite sympathetic
 
02:36:18.290 --> 02:36:18.300 align:start position:0%
to that I live in an sb2 town which no
 
02:36:20.830 --> 02:36:20.840 align:start position:0%
longer has Town meetings
 
02:36:27.889 --> 02:36:27.899 align:start position:0%
and I find it very sad uh because very
 
02:36:32.570 --> 02:36:32.580 align:start position:0%
few people show up at the meeting to
 
02:36:36.469 --> 02:36:36.479 align:start position:0%
hear what's you know to discuss possible
 
02:36:38.809 --> 02:36:38.819 align:start position:0%
amendments or whatever they show up only
 
02:36:40.370 --> 02:36:40.380 align:start position:0%
to vote and they don't necessarily know
 
02:36:43.070 --> 02:36:43.080 align:start position:0%
what they're voting on I think it's
 
02:36:45.170 --> 02:36:45.180 align:start position:0%
important for people to participate
 
02:36:47.450 --> 02:36:47.460 align:start position:0%
physically and
 
02:36:47.460 --> 02:36:48.349 align:start position:0%
physically and
um

02:36:48.349 --> 02:36:48.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:36:51.230 --> 02:36:51.240 align:start position:0%
and and as I say missed the town meeting
 
02:36:51.240 --> 02:36:52.370 align:start position:0%
and and as I say missed the town meeting
approach

02:36:52.370 --> 02:36:52.380 align:start position:0%
approach
 
02:36:52.380 --> 02:36:54.290 align:start position:0%
approach
however

02:36:54.290 --> 02:36:54.300 align:start position:0%
however
 
02:36:54.300 --> 02:36:54.969 align:start position:0%
however
um

02:36:54.969 --> 02:36:54.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:36:58.309 --> 02:36:58.319 align:start position:0%
with all the negatives that came from
 
02:36:58.319 --> 02:36:59.570 align:start position:0%
with all the negatives that came from
covid

02:36:59.570 --> 02:36:59.580 align:start position:0%
covid
 
02:37:01.849 --> 02:37:01.859 align:start position:0%
we have found
 
02:37:06.050 --> 02:37:06.060 align:start position:0%
in many Arenas that a lot more people
 
02:37:07.730 --> 02:37:07.740 align:start position:0%
pay attention
 
02:37:10.670 --> 02:37:10.680 align:start position:0%
if they can be sitting at home and
 
02:37:10.680 --> 02:37:12.410 align:start position:0%
if they can be sitting at home and
watching

02:37:12.410 --> 02:37:12.420 align:start position:0%
watching
 
02:37:15.349 --> 02:37:15.359 align:start position:0%
um and uh we see that here in the
 
02:37:17.210 --> 02:37:17.220 align:start position:0%
legislature when you look at how many
 
02:37:20.090 --> 02:37:20.100 align:start position:0%
people sign up to say they're supporting
 
02:37:22.490 --> 02:37:22.500 align:start position:0%
or opposing a particular bill and the
 
02:37:25.250 --> 02:37:25.260 align:start position:0%
more people who do that the better in
 
02:37:27.230 --> 02:37:27.240 align:start position:0%
this case we're not just talking about
 
02:37:29.690 --> 02:37:29.700 align:start position:0%
the The Observers so to speak we're
 
02:37:32.210 --> 02:37:32.220 align:start position:0%
talking about the decision makers
 
02:37:35.750 --> 02:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
and I think it's good to have people in
 
02:37:38.570 --> 02:37:38.580 align:start position:0%
the room and to be able to see
 
02:37:40.790 --> 02:37:40.800 align:start position:0%
how they're reacting and to be able to
 
02:37:42.889 --> 02:37:42.899 align:start position:0%
respond quickly
 
02:37:46.309 --> 02:37:46.319 align:start position:0%
but I also think that what this bill
 
02:37:50.770 --> 02:37:50.780 align:start position:0%
does is look at situations
 
02:37:54.349 --> 02:37:54.359 align:start position:0%
where we have been able to involve more
 
02:37:57.349 --> 02:37:57.359 align:start position:0%
people in the decision-making process by
 
02:38:00.370 --> 02:38:00.380 align:start position:0%
having them participate remotely
 
02:38:06.050 --> 02:38:06.060 align:start position:0%
and it is not mandatory the uh as I
 
02:38:08.690 --> 02:38:08.700 align:start position:0%
understand it and perhaps I'm wrong it
 
02:38:11.150 --> 02:38:11.160 align:start position:0%
is still up to the local jurisdiction to
 
02:38:13.429 --> 02:38:13.439 align:start position:0%
decide how they want to handle it and
 
02:38:16.730 --> 02:38:16.740 align:start position:0%
some local jurisdictions will say no but
 
02:38:20.570 --> 02:38:20.580 align:start position:0%
the ones that want to say yes I think
 
02:38:24.830 --> 02:38:24.840 align:start position:0%
um deserve the right to do that and so
 
02:38:27.770 --> 02:38:27.780 align:start position:0%
um uh while I would like to have
 
02:38:30.530 --> 02:38:30.540 align:start position:0%
everybody participate in person I am
 
02:38:33.650 --> 02:38:33.660 align:start position:0%
going to be supporting uh house bill
 
02:38:33.660 --> 02:38:36.110 align:start position:0%
going to be supporting uh house bill
254.

02:38:36.110 --> 02:38:36.120 align:start position:0%
254.
 
02:38:38.030 --> 02:38:38.040 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to be representative
 
02:38:40.610 --> 02:38:40.620 align:start position:0%
mannox thank you Mr chair I just wanted
 
02:38:42.469 --> 02:38:42.479 align:start position:0%
to address
 
02:38:44.870 --> 02:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
um representative Perez's concern by
 
02:38:46.990 --> 02:38:47.000 align:start position:0%
pointing out that under the amendment
 
02:38:49.969 --> 02:38:49.979 align:start position:0%
specifically school meetings and town
 
02:38:54.650 --> 02:38:54.660 align:start position:0%
meetings are excluded or Exempted and so
 
02:38:57.230 --> 02:38:57.240 align:start position:0%
I think this the amendment addresses her
 
02:38:59.889 --> 02:38:59.899 align:start position:0%
specific concern all right
 
02:39:02.510 --> 02:39:02.520 align:start position:0%
representative Perez I'm sorry I have
 
02:39:04.490 --> 02:39:04.500 align:start position:0%
one more concern
 
02:39:04.500 --> 02:39:06.469 align:start position:0%
one more concern
um

02:39:06.469 --> 02:39:06.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:39:10.190 --> 02:39:10.200 align:start position:0%
if I call up call in on the phone to be
 
02:39:11.690 --> 02:39:11.700 align:start position:0%
part of a meeting how do you know it's
 
02:39:11.700 --> 02:39:13.010 align:start position:0%
part of a meeting how do you know it's
me

02:39:13.010 --> 02:39:13.020 align:start position:0%
me
 
02:39:15.349 --> 02:39:15.359 align:start position:0%
how do you know it's me
 
02:39:15.359 --> 02:39:16.130 align:start position:0%
how do you know it's me
um

02:39:16.130 --> 02:39:16.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:39:18.710 --> 02:39:18.720 align:start position:0%
how do I know that
 
02:39:18.720 --> 02:39:20.510 align:start position:0%
how do I know that
um

02:39:20.510 --> 02:39:20.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:39:22.849 --> 02:39:22.859 align:start position:0%
representative well couldn't be you but
 
02:39:25.090 --> 02:39:25.100 align:start position:0%
who's your man and they know
 
02:39:28.130 --> 02:39:28.140 align:start position:0%
representative Divine wasn't calling in
 
02:39:31.130 --> 02:39:31.140 align:start position:0%
in my town or someplace on a meeting
 
02:39:35.030 --> 02:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
to represent me I think if they had to
 
02:39:37.849 --> 02:39:37.859 align:start position:0%
be seeing somebody is entirely different
 
02:39:40.190 --> 02:39:40.200 align:start position:0%
than hearing from somebody I was
 
02:39:43.670 --> 02:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
involved in a long case with speaking to
 
02:39:47.630 --> 02:39:47.640 align:start position:0%
a judge in Arizona and lawyers and
 
02:39:51.050 --> 02:39:51.060 align:start position:0%
I had no idea who they were at all I
 
02:39:54.950 --> 02:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
think I think it opens Pandora's Box so
 
02:39:59.150 --> 02:39:59.160 align:start position:0%
all right uh representative Stapleton
 
02:40:02.750 --> 02:40:02.760 align:start position:0%
if as I mentioned before that in the
 
02:40:05.450 --> 02:40:05.460 align:start position:0%
Sullivan County delegation we have uh
 
02:40:07.550 --> 02:40:07.560 align:start position:0%
sometimes one or two people who on
 
02:40:10.130 --> 02:40:10.140 align:start position:0%
travel or illness can't make the meeting
 
02:40:14.150 --> 02:40:14.160 align:start position:0%
but we want their valued input and so we
 
02:40:16.730 --> 02:40:16.740 align:start position:0%
have a screen and for the most part
 
02:40:19.610 --> 02:40:19.620 align:start position:0%
there's visibility there as well as
 
02:40:23.210 --> 02:40:23.220 align:start position:0%
audio for the person speaking if they
 
02:40:28.010 --> 02:40:28.020 align:start position:0%
don't have the camera capability then we
 
02:40:30.830 --> 02:40:30.840 align:start position:0%
have the voice which we recognize and or
 
02:40:34.190 --> 02:40:34.200 align:start position:0%
is uh validated that that's the right
 
02:40:36.530 --> 02:40:36.540 align:start position:0%
number the right person connected to it
 
02:40:38.929 --> 02:40:38.939 align:start position:0%
uh you know by the
 
02:40:41.270 --> 02:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
by the chair
 
02:40:41.280 --> 02:40:41.870 align:start position:0%
by the chair
um

02:40:41.870 --> 02:40:41.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:40:44.750 --> 02:40:44.760 align:start position:0%
my attitude is the bill is unnecessary
 
02:40:48.290 --> 02:40:48.300 align:start position:0%
because if it's not already prohibited
 
02:40:51.050 --> 02:40:51.060 align:start position:0%
by law and not illegal
 
02:40:53.570 --> 02:40:53.580 align:start position:0%
we already have the right and leaving it
 
02:40:56.290 --> 02:40:56.300 align:start position:0%
up to the discretion of the local
 
02:40:58.910 --> 02:40:58.920 align:start position:0%
instrumentality or authority
 
02:41:02.270 --> 02:41:02.280 align:start position:0%
makes sense under our Live Free or Die
 
02:41:05.570 --> 02:41:05.580 align:start position:0%
concept anyone else wish to speak uh
 
02:41:07.610 --> 02:41:07.620 align:start position:0%
representative Oregon
 
02:41:09.670 --> 02:41:09.680 align:start position:0%
um another
 
02:41:13.030 --> 02:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
Factor Why the remote meetings um
 
02:41:15.830 --> 02:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
profusials that in many communities the
 
02:41:18.530 --> 02:41:18.540 align:start position:0%
school is the only facility that's
 
02:41:20.389 --> 02:41:20.399 align:start position:0%
suitable for holding a public meeting
 
02:41:22.790 --> 02:41:22.800 align:start position:0%
and even when it's not you know you have
 
02:41:24.950 --> 02:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
the school board would prefer to meet
 
02:41:27.469 --> 02:41:27.479 align:start position:0%
like in Durham we do a very nice Town
 
02:41:29.809 --> 02:41:29.819 align:start position:0%
Hall but the school board prefers to
 
02:41:31.429 --> 02:41:31.439 align:start position:0%
meet at the school and that creates
 
02:41:33.830 --> 02:41:33.840 align:start position:0%
certain issues uh well there's federal
 
02:41:35.510 --> 02:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
gun law and then there's certain members
 
02:41:37.309 --> 02:41:37.319 align:start position:0%
Community who wish to participate in the
 
02:41:40.550 --> 02:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
meeting who either cannot well in some
 
02:41:42.290 --> 02:41:42.300 align:start position:0%
cases they don't feel they can ever take
 
02:41:43.550 --> 02:41:43.560 align:start position:0%
their gun off but at least they
 
02:41:46.910 --> 02:41:46.920 align:start position:0%
certainly would prefer uh not to take it
 
02:41:48.530 --> 02:41:48.540 align:start position:0%
off so they can participate at home
 
02:41:50.630 --> 02:41:50.640 align:start position:0%
where you know you say your own gun laws
 
02:41:51.830 --> 02:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
and controversy when there's a
 
02:41:53.990 --> 02:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
respiratory disease
 
02:41:56.270 --> 02:41:56.280 align:start position:0%
well there's some people who don't want
 
02:41:57.770 --> 02:41:57.780 align:start position:0%
to go anywhere without the mask is
 
02:41:59.809 --> 02:41:59.819 align:start position:0%
afraid of catching diseases others who
 
02:42:01.730 --> 02:42:01.740 align:start position:0%
feel they cannot wear the mask for
 
02:42:04.370 --> 02:42:04.380 align:start position:0%
health reasons of their own so those are
 
02:42:06.349 --> 02:42:06.359 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure we'll have more respiratory
 
02:42:09.349 --> 02:42:09.359 align:start position:0%
uh epidemics the covet one wasn't the
 
02:42:10.670 --> 02:42:10.680 align:start position:0%
last one so those are two situations
 
02:42:12.889 --> 02:42:12.899 align:start position:0%
where the remote meetings are very very
 
02:42:15.110 --> 02:42:15.120 align:start position:0%
handy because it uh
 
02:42:16.969 --> 02:42:16.979 align:start position:0%
it so you don't have to worry about
 
02:42:19.070 --> 02:42:19.080 align:start position:0%
issues with people who cannot go to
 
02:42:20.990 --> 02:42:21.000 align:start position:0%
these specific uh venue where the
 
02:42:22.550 --> 02:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
meeting is being held and of course you
 
02:42:24.590 --> 02:42:24.600 align:start position:0%
have the uh people are disabled who
 
02:42:26.690 --> 02:42:26.700 align:start position:0%
can't travel easily so
 
02:42:28.730 --> 02:42:28.740 align:start position:0%
that's like another good thing about uh
 
02:42:30.889 --> 02:42:30.899 align:start position:0%
expanding these remote meetings and
 
02:42:30.899 --> 02:42:32.090 align:start position:0%
expanding these remote meetings and
which

02:42:32.090 --> 02:42:32.100 align:start position:0%
which
 
02:42:33.950 --> 02:42:33.960 align:start position:0%
we're much better which at least in my
 
02:42:36.790 --> 02:42:36.800 align:start position:0%
community were attempted uh much better
 
02:42:39.770 --> 02:42:39.780 align:start position:0%
it'll attended as well or many cases
 
02:42:42.530 --> 02:42:42.540 align:start position:0%
better than the uh traditional in-person
 
02:42:45.050 --> 02:42:45.060 align:start position:0%
meetings all right anyone else wish to
 
02:42:47.990 --> 02:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
speak on uh HB 254 representative
 
02:42:51.250 --> 02:42:51.260 align:start position:0%
Andrews thank you Mr chairman
 
02:42:55.610 --> 02:42:55.620 align:start position:0%
I am totally against remote meetings
 
02:42:58.250 --> 02:42:58.260 align:start position:0%
when I became a legislator two years ago
 
02:43:01.190 --> 02:43:01.200 align:start position:0%
it was in covert and everything was
 
02:43:03.830 --> 02:43:03.840 align:start position:0%
remote and the state the county the
 
02:43:03.840 --> 02:43:05.270 align:start position:0%
remote and the state the county the
schools

02:43:05.270 --> 02:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
schools
 
02:43:08.990 --> 02:43:09.000 align:start position:0%
I attended so many meetings there were
 
02:43:11.870 --> 02:43:11.880 align:start position:0%
inaudible you have no idea what was
 
02:43:13.670 --> 02:43:13.680 align:start position:0%
going on
 
02:43:16.070 --> 02:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
one particular situation there's
 
02:43:18.469 --> 02:43:18.479 align:start position:0%
actually two of them I was supposed to
 
02:43:20.929 --> 02:43:20.939 align:start position:0%
be participating in the meeting
 
02:43:23.929 --> 02:43:23.939 align:start position:0%
there was no way it was Audible and I
 
02:43:25.790 --> 02:43:25.800 align:start position:0%
just left it might not have been the
 
02:43:29.990 --> 02:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
right thing to do I think like equipment
 
02:43:32.090 --> 02:43:32.100 align:start position:0%
what are we going to demand that each
 
02:43:34.010 --> 02:43:34.020 align:start position:0%
place has for equipment I mean it
 
02:43:37.370 --> 02:43:37.380 align:start position:0%
depends on how good you can project what
 
02:43:39.170 --> 02:43:39.180 align:start position:0%
you're doing if you don't have
 
02:43:41.450 --> 02:43:41.460 align:start position:0%
appropriate equipment
 
02:43:45.590 --> 02:43:45.600 align:start position:0%
I just feel is too easy to set home and
 
02:43:46.849 --> 02:43:46.859 align:start position:0%
do a remote
 
02:43:49.309 --> 02:43:49.319 align:start position:0%
and there are many people
 
02:43:53.270 --> 02:43:53.280 align:start position:0%
that don't even have access to computers
 
02:43:56.270 --> 02:43:56.280 align:start position:0%
or anything like that and might want to
 
02:43:58.010 --> 02:43:58.020 align:start position:0%
do something in person
 
02:44:02.090 --> 02:44:02.100 align:start position:0%
I just feel we're also opening up a
 
02:44:05.030 --> 02:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
candle rooms a Pandora's Box whatever
 
02:44:07.130 --> 02:44:07.140 align:start position:0%
you want to call it
 
02:44:09.730 --> 02:44:09.740 align:start position:0%
and there's going to be a lot of issues
 
02:44:11.809 --> 02:44:11.819 align:start position:0%
that we
 
02:44:15.050 --> 02:44:15.060 align:start position:0%
cannot take care of thank you
 
02:44:18.170 --> 02:44:18.180 align:start position:0%
representative Manos I just wanted to
 
02:44:23.330 --> 02:44:23.340 align:start position:0%
also add that under the a bill a quorum
 
02:44:25.130 --> 02:44:25.140 align:start position:0%
of at least a third of the total
 
02:44:27.710 --> 02:44:27.720 align:start position:0%
membership of the public body would have
 
02:44:29.570 --> 02:44:29.580 align:start position:0%
to be present at the physical location
 
02:44:32.389 --> 02:44:32.399 align:start position:0%
of the meeting and so there is a
 
02:44:36.349 --> 02:44:36.359 align:start position:0%
physical presence it's not that and that
 
02:44:38.389 --> 02:44:38.399 align:start position:0%
is required and so there is a physical
 
02:44:41.150 --> 02:44:41.160 align:start position:0%
presence and it's not that everyone
 
02:44:44.210 --> 02:44:44.220 align:start position:0%
would be participating by electronic
 
02:44:44.220 --> 02:44:45.349 align:start position:0%
would be participating by electronic
means

02:44:45.349 --> 02:44:45.359 align:start position:0%
means
 
02:44:47.090 --> 02:44:47.100 align:start position:0%
so I think
 
02:44:50.270 --> 02:44:50.280 align:start position:0%
um given that the impractic the
 
02:44:53.150 --> 02:44:53.160 align:start position:0%
impracticalness of of um
 
02:44:55.790 --> 02:44:55.800 align:start position:0%
everyone attending I think that this is
 
02:45:00.410 --> 02:45:00.420 align:start position:0%
a good and reasonable solution to
 
02:45:02.510 --> 02:45:02.520 align:start position:0%
um to the problem
 
02:45:04.309 --> 02:45:04.319 align:start position:0%
all right anyone else who should be
 
02:45:06.230 --> 02:45:06.240 align:start position:0%
heard representative Gleason thank you
 
02:45:08.389 --> 02:45:08.399 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
02:45:10.309 --> 02:45:10.319 align:start position:0%
I think we are
 
02:45:11.929 --> 02:45:11.939 align:start position:0%
conflating a couple of different things
 
02:45:14.330 --> 02:45:14.340 align:start position:0%
first of all
 
02:45:17.750 --> 02:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
the general public we we broadcast the
 
02:45:19.969 --> 02:45:19.979 align:start position:0%
meetings to the general public we are
 
02:45:21.710 --> 02:45:21.720 align:start position:0%
meeting in person but it is being put
 
02:45:23.210 --> 02:45:23.220 align:start position:0%
out and you can live stream it on
 
02:45:24.889 --> 02:45:24.899 align:start position:0%
YouTube you can participate you could
 
02:45:28.010 --> 02:45:28.020 align:start position:0%
sign up and voice your support
 
02:45:30.770 --> 02:45:30.780 align:start position:0%
um we are not taking any questions from
 
02:45:32.870 --> 02:45:32.880 align:start position:0%
anybody or comments from anybody via
 
02:45:35.210 --> 02:45:35.220 align:start position:0%
live stream we don't have a screen up
 
02:45:38.270 --> 02:45:38.280 align:start position:0%
here where we could see anybody dial in
 
02:45:38.280 --> 02:45:40.130 align:start position:0%
here where we could see anybody dial in
um

02:45:40.130 --> 02:45:40.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:45:42.349 --> 02:45:42.359 align:start position:0%
so that is a separate issue the
 
02:45:44.030 --> 02:45:44.040 align:start position:0%
participation getting people to
 
02:45:45.889 --> 02:45:45.899 align:start position:0%
participate in these meetings is a whole
 
02:45:47.870 --> 02:45:47.880 align:start position:0%
lot different than the body that is
 
02:45:49.910 --> 02:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
meeting because they are the ones who
 
02:45:52.550 --> 02:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
have to hold the meeting
 
02:45:55.250 --> 02:45:55.260 align:start position:0%
if the current bill allows only one
 
02:45:58.070 --> 02:45:58.080 align:start position:0%
third of the members to be present to
 
02:45:59.510 --> 02:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
have a quorum
 
02:46:00.889 --> 02:46:00.899 align:start position:0%
that means in a school board where
 
02:46:03.290 --> 02:46:03.300 align:start position:0%
there's only three members one person
 
02:46:06.050 --> 02:46:06.060 align:start position:0%
draws the Short Straw to go in and turn
 
02:46:08.150 --> 02:46:08.160 align:start position:0%
all the equipment on and have a meeting
 
02:46:11.150 --> 02:46:11.160 align:start position:0%
in person by him or herself while the
 
02:46:12.770 --> 02:46:12.780 align:start position:0%
other two can stay home and warm by the
 
02:46:12.780 --> 02:46:14.030 align:start position:0%
other two can stay home and warm by the
fire

02:46:14.030 --> 02:46:14.040 align:start position:0%
fire
 
02:46:16.190 --> 02:46:16.200 align:start position:0%
I don't know how you can honestly
 
02:46:20.150 --> 02:46:20.160 align:start position:0%
transact the business at hand when only
 
02:46:22.370 --> 02:46:22.380 align:start position:0%
one third of its of its me of its
 
02:46:22.380 --> 02:46:23.450 align:start position:0%
one third of its of its me of its
members

02:46:23.450 --> 02:46:23.460 align:start position:0%
members
 
02:46:27.349 --> 02:46:27.359 align:start position:0%
is comprises a quorum
 
02:46:32.690 --> 02:46:32.700 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to speak to uh HB 254
 
02:46:35.809 --> 02:46:35.819 align:start position:0%
yes representative Brennan thank you am
 
02:46:37.849 --> 02:46:37.859 align:start position:0%
I understanding correctly that we are
 
02:46:40.429 --> 02:46:40.439 align:start position:0%
still discussing the original Bill and
 
02:46:43.190 --> 02:46:43.200 align:start position:0%
not the amended bill
 
02:46:46.790 --> 02:46:46.800 align:start position:0%
the I've uh yeah there's been no there's
 
02:46:48.410 --> 02:46:48.420 align:start position:0%
been no more yeah the emotion on the
 
02:46:50.270 --> 02:46:50.280 align:start position:0%
floor is to itl the original bill
 
02:46:52.309 --> 02:46:52.319 align:start position:0%
there's been no amendment has been
 
02:46:54.110 --> 02:46:54.120 align:start position:0%
presented on the floor because we
 
02:46:55.550 --> 02:46:55.560 align:start position:0%
haven't because we're dealing with the
 
02:46:58.670 --> 02:46:58.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:01.130 --> 02:47:01.140 align:start position:0%
if I may yes um
 
02:47:03.349 --> 02:47:03.359 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at the amended version and
 
02:47:06.349 --> 02:47:06.359 align:start position:0%
I'm not quite sure exactly what has
 
02:47:08.929 --> 02:47:08.939 align:start position:0%
changed in the amended version but I
 
02:47:10.910 --> 02:47:10.920 align:start position:0%
would like to point out that
 
02:47:14.090 --> 02:47:14.100 align:start position:0%
what I'm reading is that this is an
 
02:47:16.969 --> 02:47:16.979 align:start position:0%
enabling bill that would allow governing
 
02:47:19.250 --> 02:47:19.260 align:start position:0%
bodies to make the decision if they
 
02:47:20.410 --> 02:47:20.420 align:start position:0%
would allow
 
02:47:25.250 --> 02:47:25.260 align:start position:0%
for this remote participation from a
 
02:47:26.929 --> 02:47:26.939 align:start position:0%
member of the governing body to
 
02:47:30.469 --> 02:47:30.479 align:start position:0%
participate in their meetings this is
 
02:47:36.170 --> 02:47:36.180 align:start position:0%
not a mandatory remote meeting bill this
 
02:47:39.730 --> 02:47:39.740 align:start position:0%
is allowing it says may allow
 
02:47:42.230 --> 02:47:42.240 align:start position:0%
additionally a concern that was heard
 
02:47:45.110 --> 02:47:45.120 align:start position:0%
was that members would not be able to
 
02:47:48.530 --> 02:47:48.540 align:start position:0%
see but it says explicitly here that
 
02:47:50.990 --> 02:47:51.000 align:start position:0%
each member participating electronically
 
02:47:53.950 --> 02:47:53.960 align:start position:0%
or otherwise shall be able to
 
02:47:55.910 --> 02:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
contemporaneously and throughout the
 
02:48:00.349 --> 02:48:00.359 align:start position:0%
meeting see and hear and be seen and
 
02:48:02.210 --> 02:48:02.220 align:start position:0%
heard by other members of the public
 
02:48:04.670 --> 02:48:04.680 align:start position:0%
body attending the meeting
 
02:48:07.270 --> 02:48:07.280 align:start position:0%
am I understanding it correctly that
 
02:48:10.610 --> 02:48:10.620 align:start position:0%
every member of the governing body would
 
02:48:12.590 --> 02:48:12.600 align:start position:0%
need to be seen and heard whether they
 
02:48:16.969 --> 02:48:16.979 align:start position:0%
are present in the meeting a space or
 
02:48:20.809 --> 02:48:20.819 align:start position:0%
on the electronic communication
 
02:48:23.270 --> 02:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
yes representative cuta in the original
 
02:48:25.429 --> 02:48:25.439 align:start position:0%
bill it doesn't say that it says or so
 
02:48:27.469 --> 02:48:27.479 align:start position:0%
the bill that we're talking about now
 
02:48:29.270 --> 02:48:29.280 align:start position:0%
does not say that
 
02:48:30.610 --> 02:48:30.620 align:start position:0%
thank you for that clarification
 
02:48:32.750 --> 02:48:32.760 align:start position:0%
representative Horgan did you wish to
 
02:48:35.210 --> 02:48:35.220 align:start position:0%
say something
 
02:48:38.630 --> 02:48:38.640 align:start position:0%
well yes one of I believe this
 
02:48:40.250 --> 02:48:40.260 align:start position:0%
the camera is disability one of the
 
02:48:42.830 --> 02:48:42.840 align:start position:0%
others where the right to know spokesman
 
02:48:45.469 --> 02:48:45.479 align:start position:0%
made a big point of saying we have to be
 
02:48:47.929 --> 02:48:47.939 align:start position:0%
able to read the members body language
 
02:48:50.090 --> 02:48:50.100 align:start position:0%
and I'm not sure I mean obviously it's
 
02:48:52.610 --> 02:48:52.620 align:start position:0%
part of how we're communicating but
 
02:48:54.170 --> 02:48:54.180 align:start position:0%
it seems to me we're I'm really
 
02:48:55.969 --> 02:48:55.979 align:start position:0%
responsible for our words and the body
 
02:48:58.550 --> 02:48:58.560 align:start position:0%
language is often can be often be
 
02:49:01.130 --> 02:49:01.140 align:start position:0%
misconstrued I remember many years ago
 
02:49:03.170 --> 02:49:03.180 align:start position:0%
my first term are
 
02:49:05.150 --> 02:49:05.160 align:start position:0%
the chair of this committee
 
02:49:07.790 --> 02:49:07.800 align:start position:0%
happen to have a physical disability so
 
02:49:09.309 --> 02:49:09.319 align:start position:0%
sometimes he Twitches or you
 
02:49:11.389 --> 02:49:11.399 align:start position:0%
involuntarily appeared to be laughing
 
02:49:12.770 --> 02:49:12.780 align:start position:0%
even though he was
 
02:49:12.780 --> 02:49:13.429 align:start position:0%
even though he was
um

02:49:13.429 --> 02:49:13.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:49:15.730 --> 02:49:15.740 align:start position:0%
and even though it's in fact a very
 
02:49:18.710 --> 02:49:18.720 align:start position:0%
respectful uh respectful person and his
 
02:49:20.330 --> 02:49:20.340 align:start position:0%
words were always carefully slogan so
 
02:49:23.270 --> 02:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
like some people who didn't like what
 
02:49:24.830 --> 02:49:24.840 align:start position:0%
the committee doing were accusing him of
 
02:49:26.929 --> 02:49:26.939 align:start position:0%
laughing at them on the stand when the
 
02:49:28.550 --> 02:49:28.560 align:start position:0%
fact that was uh well he does have
 
02:49:30.110 --> 02:49:30.120 align:start position:0%
several right sense of humor but that
 
02:49:33.349 --> 02:49:33.359 align:start position:0%
was absolutely not what's happening so
 
02:49:33.359 --> 02:49:34.670 align:start position:0%
was absolutely not what's happening so
um

02:49:34.670 --> 02:49:34.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:49:36.590 --> 02:49:36.600 align:start position:0%
so I think I don't know I think it's
 
02:49:39.349 --> 02:49:39.359 align:start position:0%
something I think so I think I'm not
 
02:49:42.290 --> 02:49:42.300 align:start position:0%
so I think to some extent uh
 
02:49:44.690 --> 02:49:44.700 align:start position:0%
some some extent they were asking they
 
02:49:46.730 --> 02:49:46.740 align:start position:0%
were demanding it so they can like uh
 
02:49:48.469 --> 02:49:48.479 align:start position:0%
read something into people's body
 
02:49:50.090 --> 02:49:50.100 align:start position:0%
language which may or may not have been
 
02:49:52.010 --> 02:49:52.020 align:start position:0%
there and although we have a zoom
 
02:49:54.170 --> 02:49:54.180 align:start position:0%
meeting or whatever you you can see
 
02:49:55.610 --> 02:49:55.620 align:start position:0%
people in their little frame so
 
02:49:57.650 --> 02:49:57.660 align:start position:0%
sometimes you can sort of read more of
 
02:49:59.450 --> 02:49:59.460 align:start position:0%
their expressions than you can in person
 
02:50:01.550 --> 02:50:01.560 align:start position:0%
so I think
 
02:50:03.349 --> 02:50:03.359 align:start position:0%
um I don't know I'm kind of
 
02:50:05.690 --> 02:50:05.700 align:start position:0%
now I've lost it I think it may have
 
02:50:07.670 --> 02:50:07.680 align:start position:0%
drifted off topic here but but you know
 
02:50:09.530 --> 02:50:09.540 align:start position:0%
we are primarily responsible for our
 
02:50:12.530 --> 02:50:12.540 align:start position:0%
words not for our body language and also
 
02:50:14.750 --> 02:50:14.760 align:start position:0%
um this is also the purpose of any
 
02:50:16.730 --> 02:50:16.740 align:start position:0%
meeting is primarily so the members of
 
02:50:18.590 --> 02:50:18.600 align:start position:0%
the body can discuss the issue amongst
 
02:50:21.710 --> 02:50:21.720 align:start position:0%
themselves and then when need be
 
02:50:23.389 --> 02:50:23.399 align:start position:0%
have members of public or other outside
 
02:50:25.550 --> 02:50:25.560 align:start position:0%
members with the member purpose of the
 
02:50:27.230 --> 02:50:27.240 align:start position:0%
meeting is primarily for discussion
 
02:50:30.110 --> 02:50:30.120 align:start position:0%
amongst the members of the body rather
 
02:50:32.809 --> 02:50:32.819 align:start position:0%
than uh just to allow themselves to be
 
02:50:35.210 --> 02:50:35.220 align:start position:0%
scrutinized and confronted by
 
02:50:36.950 --> 02:50:36.960 align:start position:0%
you know whoever
 
02:50:39.469 --> 02:50:39.479 align:start position:0%
by like whoever random people like are
 
02:50:41.150 --> 02:50:41.160 align:start position:0%
taking an interest in the committee for
 
02:50:43.550 --> 02:50:43.560 align:start position:0%
whatever reason so thanks all right
 
02:50:47.150 --> 02:50:47.160 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to speak on uh HP 254.

that
second

02:53:03.590 --> 02:53:03.600 align:start position:0%

um
 
02:53:12.170 --> 02:53:12.180 align:start position:0%
this motion this this amendment
 
02:53:12.180 --> 02:53:12.889 align:start position:0%
this motion this this amendment
um

02:53:12.889 --> 02:53:12.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:53:12.899 --> 02:53:14.450 align:start position:0%
um
is

02:53:14.450 --> 02:53:14.460 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:53:16.670 --> 02:53:16.680 align:start position:0%
designed to
 
02:53:21.769 --> 02:53:21.779 align:start position:0%
allow for remote meetings by State uh
 
02:53:25.849 --> 02:53:25.859 align:start position:0%
boards it's specifically excludes the
 
02:53:30.170 --> 02:53:30.180 align:start position:0%
gov the general court or either house
 
02:53:32.630 --> 02:53:32.640 align:start position:0%
thereof or any Committee of either house
 
02:53:35.330 --> 02:53:35.340 align:start position:0%
and it also specifically excludes the
 
02:53:38.710 --> 02:53:38.720 align:start position:0%
governor and Council it applies to
 
02:53:42.769 --> 02:53:42.779 align:start position:0%
however All State agencies boards
 
02:53:45.170 --> 02:53:45.180 align:start position:0%
committees councils advisory committees
 
02:53:47.510 --> 02:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
and the like and I took that language
 
02:53:49.610 --> 02:53:49.620 align:start position:0%
out of
 
02:53:49.620 --> 02:53:51.130 align:start position:0%
out of
other

02:53:51.130 --> 02:53:51.140 align:start position:0%
other
 
02:53:54.530 --> 02:53:54.540 align:start position:0%
sections of the right to know law uh the
 
02:53:57.889 --> 02:53:57.899 align:start position:0%
composition of which is permitted by law
 
02:54:00.769 --> 02:54:00.779 align:start position:0%
or regulation to be drawn from
 
02:54:02.929 --> 02:54:02.939 align:start position:0%
individuals who may reside throughout
 
02:54:05.030 --> 02:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire so this would
 
02:54:07.450 --> 02:54:07.460 align:start position:0%
apply for example to
 
02:54:10.610 --> 02:54:10.620 align:start position:0%
The Advisory representative page you
 
02:54:14.210 --> 02:54:14.220 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh an advisory commission uh
 
02:54:16.550 --> 02:54:16.560 align:start position:0%
as it was a disabilities
 
02:54:19.550 --> 02:54:19.560 align:start position:0%
two yeah one is the developmental
 
02:54:21.230 --> 02:54:21.240 align:start position:0%
Services quality Council which is
 
02:54:23.030 --> 02:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
established under RSA and then there's a
 
02:54:24.830 --> 02:54:24.840 align:start position:0%
special education advisory Council if I
 
02:54:27.230 --> 02:54:27.240 align:start position:0%
have that right that Sac I think right
 
02:54:29.210 --> 02:54:29.220 align:start position:0%
so it might I mean it wouldn't it would
 
02:54:31.010 --> 02:54:31.020 align:start position:0%
cover those kind of state you know
 
02:54:34.550 --> 02:54:34.560 align:start position:0%
Statewide advisory councils yeah thank
 
02:54:37.849 --> 02:54:37.859 align:start position:0%
you it's um and it's specifically uh
 
02:54:42.889 --> 02:54:42.899 align:start position:0%
permits uh remote meetings it requires
 
02:54:44.570 --> 02:54:44.580 align:start position:0%
um at least one third of the total
 
02:54:47.090 --> 02:54:47.100 align:start position:0%
membership to be present and you'll
 
02:54:49.309 --> 02:54:49.319 align:start position:0%
you'll notice I did make a slight change
 
02:54:51.710 --> 02:54:51.720 align:start position:0%
in this language from what was used in
 
02:54:54.769 --> 02:54:54.779 align:start position:0%
some of the other in for example the 254
 
02:54:57.170 --> 02:54:57.180 align:start position:0%
and I think even the original version of
 
02:54:57.180 --> 02:54:58.550 align:start position:0%
and I think even the original version of
308

02:54:58.550 --> 02:54:58.560 align:start position:0%
308
 
02:55:02.030 --> 02:55:02.040 align:start position:0%
I think I think it would be problematic
 
02:55:04.130 --> 02:55:04.140 align:start position:0%
to say in the in the thing about
 
02:55:06.170 --> 02:55:06.180 align:start position:0%
one-third I think it would be
 
02:55:09.170 --> 02:55:09.180 align:start position:0%
problematic to say
 
02:55:11.929 --> 02:55:11.939 align:start position:0%
it you have to have a quorum or
 
02:55:15.050 --> 02:55:15.060 align:start position:0%
one-third whichever is less
 
02:55:19.610 --> 02:55:19.620 align:start position:0%
and then say later that
 
02:55:23.570 --> 02:55:23.580 align:start position:0%
um a member participating remotely uh it
 
02:55:26.030 --> 02:55:26.040 align:start position:0%
qualifies for the Quorum because if you
 
02:55:27.830 --> 02:55:27.840 align:start position:0%
kept it if you worded it the way it was
 
02:55:30.410 --> 02:55:30.420 align:start position:0%
originally worded at least that argument
 
02:55:32.929 --> 02:55:32.939 align:start position:0%
could be made that well wait a minute uh
 
02:55:35.030 --> 02:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
all you have to have present is a cool
 
02:55:36.849 --> 02:55:36.859 align:start position:0%
all you have to have present is a quorum
 
02:55:40.370 --> 02:55:40.380 align:start position:0%
we've defined Quorum later on to be a
 
02:55:42.710 --> 02:55:42.720 align:start position:0%
person who's remote and so at least
 
02:55:43.849 --> 02:55:43.859 align:start position:0%
there would be an argument at least
 
02:55:45.530 --> 02:55:45.540 align:start position:0%
there would be a conflict so I changed
 
02:55:48.230 --> 02:55:48.240 align:start position:0%
it to say at least one-third that just
 
02:55:49.550 --> 02:55:49.560 align:start position:0%
took that out
 
02:55:51.650 --> 02:55:51.660 align:start position:0%
um I think that
 
02:55:51.660 --> 02:55:52.750 align:start position:0%
um I think that
um

02:55:52.750 --> 02:55:52.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:55:58.370 --> 02:55:58.380 align:start position:0%
this amendment makes makes sense it I
 
02:56:00.710 --> 02:56:00.720 align:start position:0%
understand that there are concerns about
 
02:56:03.710 --> 02:56:03.720 align:start position:0%
having remote meetings at all
 
02:56:05.030 --> 02:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
um and I
 
02:56:08.330 --> 02:56:08.340 align:start position:0%
in many ways I'm sympathetic to that on
 
02:56:10.610 --> 02:56:10.620 align:start position:0%
the other hand I think that uh
 
02:56:14.030 --> 02:56:14.040 align:start position:0%
representative Upham Nutter uh pointed
 
02:56:16.429 --> 02:56:16.439 align:start position:0%
out that there are a number of if she
 
02:56:18.050 --> 02:56:18.060 align:start position:0%
was talking about the rare disease I
 
02:56:20.630 --> 02:56:20.640 align:start position:0%
think advisory Council that there are a
 
02:56:24.110 --> 02:56:24.120 align:start position:0%
number of these uh committees
 
02:56:26.330 --> 02:56:26.340 align:start position:0%
um where they draw it's a Statewide
 
02:56:28.070 --> 02:56:28.080 align:start position:0%
committee they draw people from around
 
02:56:31.610 --> 02:56:31.620 align:start position:0%
the state so the travel issue is a lot
 
02:56:35.510 --> 02:56:35.520 align:start position:0%
more uh uh of a real issue than it would
 
02:56:40.610 --> 02:56:40.620 align:start position:0%
be in terms of local uh or County uh uh
 
02:56:43.130 --> 02:56:43.140 align:start position:0%
boards or commissions
 
02:56:43.140 --> 02:56:43.969 align:start position:0%
boards or commissions
um

02:56:43.969 --> 02:56:43.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:56:46.070 --> 02:56:46.080 align:start position:0%
and so I think that
 
02:56:50.750 --> 02:56:50.760 align:start position:0%
uh this makes sense uh to do this uh and
 
02:56:53.210 --> 02:56:53.220 align:start position:0%
I hope uh I hope that
 
02:56:55.429 --> 02:56:55.439 align:start position:0%
um we'll get a bipartisan vote to
 
02:56:57.830 --> 02:56:57.840 align:start position:0%
support this because I do I do think
 
02:56:59.990 --> 02:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
um it makes sense and I and although I
 
02:57:01.849 --> 02:57:01.859 align:start position:0%
appreciate uh
 
02:57:05.030 --> 02:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
um uh representative up uh uh Nutter
 
02:57:07.730 --> 02:57:07.740 align:start position:0%
upham's uh concerned in particular about
 
02:57:10.849 --> 02:57:10.859 align:start position:0%
the disabilities uh uh I mean I'm sorry
 
02:57:14.570 --> 02:57:14.580 align:start position:0%
the rare disease uh advisory Council I I
 
02:57:17.150 --> 02:57:17.160 align:start position:0%
I don't think and I hope that most of
 
02:57:19.010 --> 02:57:19.020 align:start position:0%
the majority of you will agree that it
 
02:57:20.929 --> 02:57:20.939 align:start position:0%
doesn't make sense to pick out one
 
02:57:22.730 --> 02:57:22.740 align:start position:0%
particular board
 
02:57:24.290 --> 02:57:24.300 align:start position:0%
um it makes more sense to just have a
 
02:57:26.450 --> 02:57:26.460 align:start position:0%
kind of a general generally applicable
 
02:57:26.460 --> 02:57:27.590 align:start position:0%
kind of a general generally applicable
uh

02:57:27.590 --> 02:57:27.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:57:30.469 --> 02:57:30.479 align:start position:0%
uh proficient so with that I hope you
 
02:57:32.750 --> 02:57:32.760 align:start position:0%
will support uh this amendment
 
02:57:35.330 --> 02:57:35.340 align:start position:0%
representative uh Oregon
 
02:57:37.010 --> 02:57:37.020 align:start position:0%
um thank you I
 
02:57:39.349 --> 02:57:39.359 align:start position:0%
happen to belong to a well actually it's
 
02:57:39.359 --> 02:57:40.070 align:start position:0%
happen to belong to a well actually it's
a

02:57:40.070 --> 02:57:40.080 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:57:42.710 --> 02:57:42.720 align:start position:0%
Vital Records privacy board which is um
 
02:57:45.830 --> 02:57:45.840 align:start position:0%
a joint under the Aegis of uh Health and
 
02:57:47.690 --> 02:57:47.700 align:start position:0%
Human Services and the Secretary of
 
02:57:49.849 --> 02:57:49.859 align:start position:0%
State's office and um
 
02:57:52.190 --> 02:57:52.200 align:start position:0%
they and they read in this they actually
 
02:57:53.450 --> 02:57:53.460 align:start position:0%
meet in the same facility where I
 
02:57:55.070 --> 02:57:55.080 align:start position:0%
believe the rare disease board would
 
02:57:56.990 --> 02:57:57.000 align:start position:0%
meet if it had ever had an in-person
 
02:57:58.790 --> 02:57:58.800 align:start position:0%
meeting in the last couple of years and
 
02:58:02.630 --> 02:58:02.640 align:start position:0%
that's in the secure area of uh well the
 
02:58:06.230 --> 02:58:06.240 align:start position:0%
hhs's office on offices on on Hazen
 
02:58:09.190 --> 02:58:09.200 align:start position:0%
drive so it's in the small
 
02:58:12.290 --> 02:58:12.300 align:start position:0%
conference room that has fairly robust
 
02:58:12.300 --> 02:58:13.510 align:start position:0%
conference room that has fairly robust
uh

02:58:13.510 --> 02:58:13.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:58:15.469 --> 02:58:15.479 align:start position:0%
teleconferencing facilities and they
 
02:58:17.030 --> 02:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
often have a variety of meetings there
 
02:58:19.730 --> 02:58:19.740 align:start position:0%
many of which are confidential so it
 
02:58:22.550 --> 02:58:22.560 align:start position:0%
isn't really practical to have a large
 
02:58:25.250 --> 02:58:25.260 align:start position:0%
group of the public uh in that small
 
02:58:26.990 --> 02:58:27.000 align:start position:0%
conference room although they do have a
 
02:58:28.670 --> 02:58:28.680 align:start position:0%
Auditorium in other spaces they could
 
02:58:30.710 --> 02:58:30.720 align:start position:0%
use if for some reason
 
02:58:33.290 --> 02:58:33.300 align:start position:0%
a large number of uh
 
02:58:35.210 --> 02:58:35.220 align:start position:0%
people from the general public showed up
 
02:58:37.849 --> 02:58:37.859 align:start position:0%
usually uh usually nobody shows up in
 
02:58:39.889 --> 02:58:39.899 align:start position:0%
the case of my board I'm not even
 
02:58:41.450 --> 02:58:41.460 align:start position:0%
I think maybe they're doing a little bit
 
02:58:43.010 --> 02:58:43.020 align:start position:0%
of security by security I'm not even
 
02:58:45.530 --> 02:58:45.540 align:start position:0%
sure exactly where you would go to find
 
02:58:48.349 --> 02:58:48.359 align:start position:0%
out that it exists but um
 
02:58:50.690 --> 02:58:50.700 align:start position:0%
so as a as a practical matter the rare
 
02:58:52.250 --> 02:58:52.260 align:start position:0%
disease conference is one of a number of
 
02:58:55.010 --> 02:58:55.020 align:start position:0%
bodies some of which are in groups some
 
02:58:58.010 --> 02:58:58.020 align:start position:0%
of which are covered by you know this
 
02:59:00.349 --> 02:59:00.359 align:start position:0%
law some of which are you know just ad
 
02:59:04.130 --> 02:59:04.140 align:start position:0%
hoc groups in HHS who really it isn't
 
02:59:06.110 --> 02:59:06.120 align:start position:0%
necessarily practice with them to meet
 
02:59:08.450 --> 02:59:08.460 align:start position:0%
in the auditorium except in rare rare
 
02:59:10.190 --> 02:59:10.200 align:start position:0%
occasions and so it's more practical for
 
02:59:12.530 --> 02:59:12.540 align:start position:0%
them to meet you know securely through
 
02:59:14.349 --> 02:59:14.359 align:start position:0%
their well-established teleconferencing
 
02:59:16.730 --> 02:59:16.740 align:start position:0%
facilities which work pretty well I've
 
02:59:18.950 --> 02:59:18.960 align:start position:0%
participated in board meetings both in
 
02:59:23.330 --> 02:59:23.340 align:start position:0%
person and uh and uh and and remotely
 
02:59:24.889 --> 02:59:24.899 align:start position:0%
and their experience has been good
 
02:59:27.530 --> 02:59:27.540 align:start position:0%
either way so all right that's just my
 
02:59:29.510 --> 02:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
my two cents on it and that was I've
 
02:59:31.010 --> 02:59:31.020 align:start position:0%
explained what the original impetus for
 
02:59:34.070 --> 02:59:34.080 align:start position:0%
the bill was so and it um it applies not
 
02:59:35.330 --> 02:59:35.340 align:start position:0%
just to that committee but to a number
 
02:59:37.849 --> 02:59:37.859 align:start position:0%
of other committees so I think they
 
02:59:39.769 --> 02:59:39.779 align:start position:0%
should be they should be allowed to uh
 
02:59:41.929 --> 02:59:41.939 align:start position:0%
meet meet remotely in most cases thanks
 
02:59:44.510 --> 02:59:44.520 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to speak on this
 
02:59:46.670 --> 02:59:46.680 align:start position:0%
amendment to uh House Bill 308
 
02:59:48.889 --> 02:59:48.899 align:start position:0%
representative Stapleton
 
02:59:51.469 --> 02:59:51.479 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
02:59:51.479 --> 02:59:52.550 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
um

02:59:52.550 --> 02:59:52.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:59:54.769 --> 02:59:54.779 align:start position:0%
the ability to have
 
02:59:57.590 --> 02:59:57.600 align:start position:0%
a remote person constitute help
 
03:00:00.710 --> 03:00:00.720 align:start position:0%
constitute Quorum is really helpful and
 
03:00:03.889 --> 03:00:03.899 align:start position:0%
avoids the inefficiency of not being
 
03:00:05.750 --> 03:00:05.760 align:start position:0%
able to do business in a meeting for
 
03:00:08.510 --> 03:00:08.520 align:start position:0%
those that have physically gathered
 
03:00:10.429 --> 03:00:10.439 align:start position:0%
and you know we're getting into
 
03:00:14.330 --> 03:00:14.340 align:start position:0%
situations illness travel a disability
 
03:00:14.340 --> 03:00:15.830 align:start position:0%
situations illness travel a disability
weather

03:00:15.830 --> 03:00:15.840 align:start position:0%
weather
 
03:00:18.290 --> 03:00:18.300 align:start position:0%
and so I think this is an important
 
03:00:21.410 --> 03:00:21.420 align:start position:0%
provision and and we we protect it by
 
03:00:25.309 --> 03:00:25.319 align:start position:0%
having a roll call vote in the case of
 
03:00:28.070 --> 03:00:28.080 align:start position:0%
having a remote person attending so I'm
 
03:00:31.790 --> 03:00:31.800 align:start position:0%
in favor of it right anyone else wish to
 
03:00:35.690 --> 03:00:35.700 align:start position:0%
uh speak on the amendment to HB 308
 
03:00:38.389 --> 03:00:38.399 align:start position:0%
um so I uh this is an amendment we can
 
03:00:40.790 --> 03:00:40.800 align:start position:0%
vote by a Voice vote or unless somebody
 
03:00:44.929 --> 03:00:44.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:46.730 --> 03:00:46.740 align:start position:0%
yes all right there's been a request for
 
03:00:48.830 --> 03:00:48.840 align:start position:0%
a role yeah I'm sorry so we'll have a
 
03:00:50.750 --> 03:00:50.760 align:start position:0%
roll call vote then on the amendment uh
 
03:00:52.670 --> 03:00:52.680 align:start position:0%

03:00:57.170 --> 03:00:57.180 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
03:01:00.050 --> 03:01:00.060 align:start position:0%
again I'm going to vote against this I
 
03:01:02.929 --> 03:01:02.939 align:start position:0%
do not believe in remote meetings I
 
03:01:06.050 --> 03:01:06.060 align:start position:0%
understand what everybody says I'm not
 
03:01:10.730 --> 03:01:10.740 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:14.450 --> 03:01:14.460 align:start position:0%
but when you take an office or you go on
 
03:01:15.650 --> 03:01:15.660 align:start position:0%
a committee
 
03:01:18.830 --> 03:01:18.840 align:start position:0%
you know right then and there you need
 
03:01:22.429 --> 03:01:22.439 align:start position:0%
to show up and if you don't show up or
 
03:01:25.309 --> 03:01:25.319 align:start position:0%
do you feel that you're not going to you
 
03:01:26.990 --> 03:01:27.000 align:start position:0%
should not
 
03:01:29.570 --> 03:01:29.580 align:start position:0%

Smith is there someone who will write
 
03:04:44.050 --> 03:04:44.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:48.769 --> 03:04:48.779 align:start position:0%
minority okay all right uh well let's
 
03:04:54.110 --> 03:04:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:03.530 --> 03:05:03.540 align:start position:0%

um
 
03:05:10.090 --> 03:05:10.100 align:start position:0%
I guess uh
 
03:05:12.469 --> 03:05:12.479 align:start position:0%
representative Smith has has rightly
 
03:05:14.510 --> 03:05:14.520 align:start position:0%
pointed out that I've created a lot of
 
03:05:17.090 --> 03:05:17.100 align:start position:0%
work for myself by writing firefighting
 
03:05:18.950 --> 03:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
amendments and stuff like that but since
 
03:05:20.990 --> 03:05:21.000 align:start position:0%
I wrote the amendment I'll write the uh
 
03:05:24.290 --> 03:05:24.300 align:start position:0%
majority report on 308 will there be a
 
03:05:28.670 --> 03:05:28.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:29.809 --> 03:05:29.819 align:start position:0%
all right
 
03:05:31.790 --> 03:05:31.800 align:start position:0%
so I will write the majority and
 
03:05:33.769 --> 03:05:33.779 align:start position:0%
representative Andrus will write the
 
03:05:33.779 --> 03:05:35.450 align:start position:0%
representative Andrus will write the
minority

03:05:35.450 --> 03:05:35.460 align:start position:0%
minority
 
03:05:37.849 --> 03:05:37.859 align:start position:0%
all right
 
03:05:39.650 --> 03:05:39.660 align:start position:0%
see we're letting you make these motions
 
03:05:40.910 --> 03:05:40.920 align:start position:0%
we know you're going to train yourself
 
03:05:42.469 --> 03:05:42.479 align:start position:0%
out of it pretty soon right right right
 
03:05:44.330 --> 03:05:44.340 align:start position:0%

03:05:44.340 --> 03:05:47.150 align:start position:0%

03:05:50.210 --> 03:05:50.220 align:start position:0%
all right so um
 
03:05:52.190 --> 03:05:52.200 align:start position:0%
what I'd uh
 
03:05:55.490 --> 03:05:55.500 align:start position:0%
what I'd like is to say still remember
 
03:05:57.230 --> 03:05:57.240 align:start position:0%
these reports don't have to be long they
 
03:05:59.030 --> 03:05:59.040 align:start position:0%
don't have to be you know
 
03:06:02.269 --> 03:06:02.279 align:start position:0%
uh very detailed but I I would like to
 
03:06:04.670 --> 03:06:04.680 align:start position:0%
ask to have the reports in again by the
 
03:06:07.010 --> 03:06:07.020 align:start position:0%
close of business tomorrow
 
03:06:09.469 --> 03:06:09.479 align:start position:0%
um so we can get and I'm making I'm
 
03:06:11.630 --> 03:06:11.640 align:start position:0%
imposing the deadline probably more but
