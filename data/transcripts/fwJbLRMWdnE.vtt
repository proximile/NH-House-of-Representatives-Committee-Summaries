going hunting on land that's not posted
 
00:10:58.310 --> 00:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
pulling up in their truck getting out
 
00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:00.680 align:start position:0%
going into the woods coming back out
 
00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:02.680 align:start position:0%
being called by the police and uh
 
00:11:04.509 --> 00:11:04.519 align:start position:0%
meeting them out there to ask them why
 
00:11:06.629 --> 00:11:06.639 align:start position:0%
they're hunting on poed property because
 
00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:07.720 align:start position:0%
while they were out there someone
 
00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
stapled up some no trespassing no
 
00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:11.480 align:start position:0%
hunting posters turning out that it
 
00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:13.160 align:start position:0%
wasn't really their property it's just
 
00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:16.040 align:start position:0%
activists who don't like hunting um so
 
00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:17.880 align:start position:0%
this would make it unlawful for someone
 
00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:20.160 align:start position:0%
to post land like that if it's not their
 
00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
property further
 
00:11:26.829 --> 00:11:26.839 align:start position:0%
discussion representative um har gather
 
00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:29.000 align:start position:0%
yes um I don't have a problem with the
 
00:11:30.829 --> 00:11:30.839 align:start position:0%
bill but I do have a problem with the
 
00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:35.560 align:start position:0%
actual um misdemeanor B um I would be
 
00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:37.880 align:start position:0%
willing to take a look at it and maybe
 
00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:40.240 align:start position:0%
do something like a violation of fine
 
00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:41.120 align:start position:0%
than a
 
00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:43.120 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor but to start off with a
 
00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:45.320 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor B I have a problem with
 
00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:47.480 align:start position:0%
that further
 
00:11:50.629 --> 00:11:50.639 align:start position:0%
discussion given the um the given the
 
00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:53.320 align:start position:0%
late uh date I do not anticipate um
 
00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:55.880 align:start position:0%
waiting on that any any further
 
00:11:57.990 --> 00:11:58.000 align:start position:0%
discussion see none I asked the clerk to
 
00:11:59.509 --> 00:11:59.519 align:start position:0%
call the rooll the motion on the excuse
 
00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
me oh representative
 
00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:03.680 align:start position:0%
M I just want to say that I agree with
 
00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:06.680 align:start position:0%
representative Harriet gaite um I think
 
00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:09.440 align:start position:0%
that this uh penalty of Class B
 
00:12:13.189 --> 00:12:13.199 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor uh is uh a little too severe
 
00:12:16.189 --> 00:12:16.199 align:start position:0%
uh for something of this nature and uh a
 
00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:18.040 align:start position:0%
violation level offense would be more
 
00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
appropriate um the idea that somebody
 
00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:23.320 align:start position:0%
might get a criminal record uh for what
 
00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:26.240 align:start position:0%
could be a prank uh doesn't sit well
 
00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
with me what doesn't sit well with me is
 
00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:30.160 align:start position:0%
that some who's out there hunting will
 
00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:31.720 align:start position:0%
be charged with a criminal offense for
 
00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
trespassing or on posted property until
 
00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:36.920 align:start position:0%
they can prove otherwise so um a prank
 
00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:38.680 align:start position:0%
that could end up with someone with a
 
00:12:41.629 --> 00:12:41.639 align:start position:0%
criminal charge in my mind should be uh
 
00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:45.240 align:start position:0%
a similar a similar offense um with that
 
00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:46.720 align:start position:0%
I'll ask clerk to call the RO motion of
 
00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:49.120 align:start position:0%

recognize representative rhs to make a
 
00:17:17.829 --> 00:17:17.839 align:start position:0%

00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:20.640 align:start position:0%
pass second second by representative
 
00:17:21.630 --> 00:17:21.640 align:start position:0%
appr would you like to speak to your
 
00:17:25.429 --> 00:17:25.439 align:start position:0%
motion oh thank you Mr chairman um you
 
00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
know if a if a person makes a false
 
00:17:31.549 --> 00:17:31.559 align:start position:0%
report about a a police officer not only
 
00:17:33.549 --> 00:17:33.559 align:start position:0%
does the officer have to you know go
 
00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:35.880 align:start position:0%
through the the investigation process
 
00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:38.640 align:start position:0%
now there is obviously a a an incredibly
 
00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
black mark on their name um and not to
 
00:17:44.590 --> 00:17:44.600 align:start position:0%
mention the expense of of it so this
 
00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:47.360 align:start position:0%
would basically um create a misdemeanor
 
00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:50.200 align:start position:0%
level if you make a knowingly make a
 
00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:52.440 align:start position:0%
false report about misconduct of an
 
00:17:54.669 --> 00:17:54.679 align:start position:0%
officer that you know that is
 
00:17:56.470 --> 00:17:56.480 align:start position:0%
false would you like to speak to your
 
00:17:57.830 --> 00:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
second representative
 
00:18:02.110 --> 00:18:02.120 align:start position:0%
PR sure I believe right now there's no
 
00:18:05.669 --> 00:18:05.679 align:start position:0%
penalty for making such a report uh and
 
00:18:08.029 --> 00:18:08.039 align:start position:0%
I don't think people really grasp what a
 
00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:10.640 align:start position:0%
report like that does to an officer in
 
00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:13.600 align:start position:0%
his career his job he may be suspended
 
00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:16.880 align:start position:0%
while the investigation's going on so
 
00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
there needs to be a penalty for for
 
00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:21.480 align:start position:0%
making a false report and I'm glad to
 
00:18:24.190 --> 00:18:24.200 align:start position:0%
see we're finally getting to it thank
 
00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:27.320 align:start position:0%
you I I would add that as we as we
 
00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:29.400 align:start position:0%
mature as a society
 
00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:32.200 align:start position:0%
um we've decided we're going to hold our
 
00:18:34.110 --> 00:18:34.120 align:start position:0%
police officers to a higher standard and
 
00:18:36.430 --> 00:18:36.440 align:start position:0%
I think that's justifiably so at the
 
00:18:37.870 --> 00:18:37.880 align:start position:0%
same time we have to understand we are
 
00:18:40.149 --> 00:18:40.159 align:start position:0%
in a partnership with law enforcement so
 
00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:42.440 align:start position:0%
we must hold ourselves to that same high
 
00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:45.440 align:start position:0%
standard so by making false reports
 
00:18:47.190 --> 00:18:47.200 align:start position:0%
about someone knowingly and
 
00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:50.440 align:start position:0%
intentionally um I feel like there
 
00:18:53.549 --> 00:18:53.559 align:start position:0%
definitely should be some type of
 
00:18:55.710 --> 00:18:55.720 align:start position:0%
societal answer to people that do that
 
00:18:58.990 --> 00:18:59.000 align:start position:0%
because of the incredible um effect it
 
00:19:00.789 --> 00:19:00.799 align:start position:0%
has on someone who's the subject of such
 
00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:03.360 align:start position:0%
a report I believe someone famously once
 
00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:04.840 align:start position:0%
said where do I go now to get my
 
00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
reputation back um and and that's
 
00:19:10.990 --> 00:19:11.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely correct because after the
 
00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:12.600 align:start position:0%
investigation's done and the officer's
 
00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:14.440 align:start position:0%
been cleared their names still out there
 
00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:16.840 align:start position:0%
in the press for that allegation forever
 
00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:19.320 align:start position:0%
um so I I think this is an important
 
00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:22.120 align:start position:0%
bill further discussion representative
 
00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:25.600 align:start position:0%
Harriet gather I have a question um can
 
00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
you define misconduct versus criminal
 
00:19:30.149 --> 00:19:30.159 align:start position:0%
conduct to us
 
00:19:32.549 --> 00:19:32.559 align:start position:0%
please I've been trying to figure that
 
00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:35.200 align:start position:0%
one out in this bill pres Manning would
 
00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
you like to speak to
 
00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:39.200 align:start position:0%
that yeah so when I initially filed the
 
00:19:40.510 --> 00:19:40.520 align:start position:0%
bill missconduct would be anything
 
00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
that's not criminal but um there was
 
00:19:45.029 --> 00:19:45.039 align:start position:0%
some testimony about miss condic being
 
00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:47.600 align:start position:0%
already defined in the statute uh for
 
00:19:48.669 --> 00:19:48.679 align:start position:0%
the police standards and training
 
00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:50.240 align:start position:0%
Council so that's different than
 
00:19:51.630 --> 00:19:51.640 align:start position:0%
criminal activity so if you somebody
 
00:19:54.549 --> 00:19:54.559 align:start position:0%
says that you use a racial slur or they
 
00:19:57.430 --> 00:19:57.440 align:start position:0%
were rude to me or they they did
 
00:19:59.230 --> 00:19:59.240 align:start position:0%
something else that was just
 
00:20:01.029 --> 00:20:01.039 align:start position:0%
that that falls under those uh those
 
00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
guidelines that would be misconduct if
 
00:20:05.029 --> 00:20:05.039 align:start position:0%
somebody says they stole my money or
 
00:20:08.149 --> 00:20:08.159 align:start position:0%
they assaulted me or they uh touch me
 
00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:09.960 align:start position:0%
inappropriately that's criminal activity
 
00:20:11.549 --> 00:20:11.559 align:start position:0%
that you're accusing the officer of so
 
00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:13.280 align:start position:0%
there's two different distinctions there
 
00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:16.240 align:start position:0%
obviously the the latter being more
 
00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:19.000 align:start position:0%
serious I guess that that de matter that
 
00:20:20.789 --> 00:20:20.799 align:start position:0%
depends on who's receiving that
 
00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:22.400 align:start position:0%
information whether it's more serious or
 
00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:24.600 align:start position:0%
not I would I would assume that no
 
00:20:26.029 --> 00:20:26.039 align:start position:0%
matter who's hearing it it would be
 
00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
criminals is more serious
 
00:20:31.909 --> 00:20:31.919 align:start position:0%
one other question go ahead um how is
 
00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
noly defined in law now in our laws I
 
00:20:37.870 --> 00:20:37.880 align:start position:0%
couldn't find
 
00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
that um knowingly yeah um I'm I'm pretty
 
00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:43.360 align:start position:0%
sure I don't know that it's defined in
 
00:20:46.390 --> 00:20:46.400 align:start position:0%
statute but it's defined by the court um
 
00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:48.400 align:start position:0%
knowingly would mean that you had to
 
00:20:51.549 --> 00:20:51.559 align:start position:0%
actually know for a fact that what you
 
00:20:55.870 --> 00:20:55.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:59.390 --> 00:20:59.400 align:start position:0%
incorrect be to Pro okay thank you very
 
00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:02.280 align:start position:0%
much you're welcome chairman
 
00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
yes with respect to knowingly the way I
 
00:21:07.549 --> 00:21:07.559 align:start position:0%
think of it and I think that's the way
 
00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:10.520 align:start position:0%
it is in law is it it's possible for
 
00:21:14.110 --> 00:21:14.120 align:start position:0%
someone to make an accusation and make a
 
00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:17.320 align:start position:0%
mistake in they they made a mistake but
 
00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:20.840 align:start position:0%
knowingly doing it is different from
 
00:21:22.110 --> 00:21:22.120 align:start position:0%
making a
 
00:21:25.269 --> 00:21:25.279 align:start position:0%
mistake so that's how I took that you
 
00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:27.240 align:start position:0%
know the
 
00:21:30.029 --> 00:21:30.039 align:start position:0%
difference all right thank
 
00:21:32.549 --> 00:21:32.559 align:start position:0%
you any further discussion did you want
 
00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:34.200 align:start position:0%
to add on that uh representative Manion
 
00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:35.960 align:start position:0%
on the knowingly thing yeah so there's
 
00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:37.960 align:start position:0%
four coupable state of mind uh
 
00:21:40.510 --> 00:21:40.520 align:start position:0%
negligently recklessly knowingly and
 
00:21:42.789 --> 00:21:42.799 align:start position:0%
purposely so obviously they they go up
 
00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:44.760 align:start position:0%
so purposely would be the most the
 
00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:47.360 align:start position:0%
hardest to prove but if someone did
 
00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
something negligently or recklessly they
 
00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:51.720 align:start position:0%
still may be doing it knowingly but
 
00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:54.480 align:start position:0%
that's less that's that's less to prove
 
00:21:56.149 --> 00:21:56.159 align:start position:0%
so knowingly it's pretty it's a pretty
 
00:21:59.029 --> 00:21:59.039 align:start position:0%
high standard to prove uh in court that
 
00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:01.120 align:start position:0%
you did it with the with that intent
 
00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
that you knew it was false but you did
 
00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
it to uh whatever for Retribution
 
00:22:07.549 --> 00:22:07.559 align:start position:0%
against the officer or whatnot so that's
 
00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:10.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:13.549 --> 00:22:13.559 align:start position:0%
knowingly representative
 
00:22:16.350 --> 00:22:16.360 align:start position:0%
M yeah I'm going to vote uh against this
 
00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:18.480 align:start position:0%
bill I I think one of the big concerns
 
00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:20.400 align:start position:0%
that I have with it is it could very
 
00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:23.080 align:start position:0%
well discourage people uh from reporting
 
00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
police misconduct in the first place um
 
00:22:29.470 --> 00:22:29.480 align:start position:0%
we had some testimony uh from the state
 
00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:34.120 align:start position:0%
police also that uh the uh sworn
 
00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:36.080 align:start position:0%
falsification statute wouldn't apply if
 
00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
these statements are not because these
 
00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:39.520 align:start position:0%
statements aren't sworn and that another
 
00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:42.720 align:start position:0%
statute deals with unsworn false
 
00:22:45.269 --> 00:22:45.279 align:start position:0%
falsification uh so there may be overlap
 
00:22:48.510 --> 00:22:48.520 align:start position:0%
between that statute uh and this one and
 
00:22:50.669 --> 00:22:50.679 align:start position:0%
I think the the other thing we need to
 
00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:53.360 align:start position:0%
realize is the power equation uh between
 
00:22:57.029 --> 00:22:57.039 align:start position:0%
a citizen and between a police officer
 
00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:01.440 align:start position:0%
um there are remedies for uh uh for
 
00:23:04.789 --> 00:23:04.799 align:start position:0%
police officers who are unfairly accused
 
00:23:07.669 --> 00:23:07.679 align:start position:0%
um there are processes in place I'm just
 
00:23:09.390 --> 00:23:09.400 align:start position:0%
not sure that we need a law we need to
 
00:23:12.190 --> 00:23:12.200 align:start position:0%
put a law like this into statute um at
 
00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:13.950 align:start position:0%
put a law like this into statute um at
this

00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:13.960 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:17.400 align:start position:0%
time anything further see none I ask

with a drink does anyone need one does
 
00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:52.440 align:start position:0%

waiting okay representative approv
 
00:25:04.269 --> 00:25:04.279 align:start position:0%
second um would you like to speak to
 
00:25:05.909 --> 00:25:05.919 align:start position:0%
your motion on the amendment sure thank
 
00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:08.080 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman uh so this was the bill
 
00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
that came before us about the no
 
00:25:13.070 --> 00:25:13.080 align:start position:0%
trespass orders and the concern was not
 
00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:14.520 align:start position:0%
that people should not be able to
 
00:25:16.669 --> 00:25:16.679 align:start position:0%
receive a no trespass order it was the
 
00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:18.320 align:start position:0%
fact that there was not any kind of a
 
00:25:21.870 --> 00:25:21.880 align:start position:0%
process in place that if a person did
 
00:25:24.110 --> 00:25:24.120 align:start position:0%
and when we heard testimony there were
 
00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:27.360 align:start position:0%
some questions asked um you know when
 
00:25:28.870 --> 00:25:28.880 align:start position:0%
when when one of these these trespass
 
00:25:31.549 --> 00:25:31.559 align:start position:0%
orders is given is there also something
 
00:25:33.470 --> 00:25:33.480 align:start position:0%
given that tells them what the process
 
00:25:35.269 --> 00:25:35.279 align:start position:0%
would be to have this removed or how
 
00:25:37.549 --> 00:25:37.559 align:start position:0%
long this is going to be in effect the
 
00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
answer was no so uh the sponsor did hear
 
00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:43.080 align:start position:0%
some of the concerns we had with the way
 
00:25:44.950 --> 00:25:44.960 align:start position:0%
the bill was written uh the amendment in
 
00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
front of you is basically a replace all
 
00:25:50.029 --> 00:25:50.039 align:start position:0%
and it actually gives a process for
 
00:25:52.029 --> 00:25:52.039 align:start position:0%
person if they do receive one um it
 
00:25:54.549 --> 00:25:54.559 align:start position:0%
talks about the ability to request a
 
00:25:57.710 --> 00:25:57.720 align:start position:0%
hearing um it does have in here you know
 
00:26:00.149 --> 00:26:00.159 align:start position:0%
also some safeguards for the person that
 
00:26:02.789 --> 00:26:02.799 align:start position:0%
is that is issuing the no trespass order
 
00:26:04.510 --> 00:26:04.520 align:start position:0%
in other words if if you receive a no
 
00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:06.720 align:start position:0%
trespass order and you you know you
 
00:26:08.510 --> 00:26:08.520 align:start position:0%
violate that and you get another no
 
00:26:11.389 --> 00:26:11.399 align:start position:0%
trespass order within two years um
 
00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
they're actually able to have it have
 
00:26:16.590 --> 00:26:16.600 align:start position:0%
that no trespass order B for one year um
 
00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:18.720 align:start position:0%
it also gives them the ability to extend
 
00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:21.360 align:start position:0%
it for 90 days if they see fit but more
 
00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:23.120 align:start position:0%
importantly it gives a process for the
 
00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:25.120 align:start position:0%
person that received it and it will be
 
00:26:28.549 --> 00:26:28.559 align:start position:0%
clearly outlined what the process is for
 
00:26:31.950 --> 00:26:31.960 align:start position:0%
them if they receive the they receive
 
00:26:34.549 --> 00:26:34.559 align:start position:0%
it expect to speak to your second
 
00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:36.480 align:start position:0%
representative I think she covered it
 
00:26:40.149 --> 00:26:40.159 align:start position:0%
quite well and I but I would add that
 
00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:43.320 align:start position:0%
there definitely needs to be a way and
 
00:26:45.669 --> 00:26:45.679 align:start position:0%
people have the knowledge to know that
 
00:26:49.510 --> 00:26:49.520 align:start position:0%
the no trespass order can be revoked uh
 
00:26:52.549 --> 00:26:52.559 align:start position:0%
at some point in time thank you
 
00:26:53.950 --> 00:26:53.960 align:start position:0%
representative rhs I know that there
 
00:26:57.710 --> 00:26:57.720 align:start position:0%
were some questions about how um how it
 
00:26:59.510 --> 00:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
would be appealed and the in the
 
00:27:01.190 --> 00:27:01.200 align:start position:0%
original bill I think it said something
 
00:27:03.310 --> 00:27:03.320 align:start position:0%
about like they had to be unanimous or
 
00:27:06.630 --> 00:27:06.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:09.269 --> 00:27:09.279 align:start position:0%
addressed Mr chair there is a there is a
 
00:27:11.669 --> 00:27:11.679 align:start position:0%
process in here for the the appealing
 
00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:13.240 align:start position:0%
and if you give me a second I can find
 
00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:16.240 align:start position:0%
the um yeah the exact
 
00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:18.830 align:start position:0%
the um yeah the exact
line

00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:18.840 align:start position:0%
line
 
00:27:22.669 --> 00:27:22.679 align:start position:0%
um line 15 so if you if you look at the
 
00:27:25.230 --> 00:27:25.240 align:start position:0%
very first part like on line8 it starts
 
00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:27.640 align:start position:0%
to talk about it and then on line 15 it
 
00:27:29.350 --> 00:27:29.360 align:start position:0%
talks about requesting the hearing and
 
00:27:31.630 --> 00:27:31.640 align:start position:0%
then it goes on that's where it goes on
 
00:27:34.909 --> 00:27:34.919 align:start position:0%
to say how they can be extended um
 
00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:37.360 align:start position:0%
however they can also be
 
00:27:40.630 --> 00:27:40.640 align:start position:0%
revoked okay and it takes now uh 23ds
 
00:27:43.509 --> 00:27:43.519 align:start position:0%
under this versus a unanimous vote of
 
00:27:43.519 --> 00:27:46.669 align:start position:0%
under this versus a unanimous vote of
the

00:27:46.669 --> 00:27:46.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:49.310 --> 00:27:49.320 align:start position:0%
body which is what I was um trying to
 
00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:50.470 align:start position:0%
body which is what I was um trying to
figure

00:27:50.470 --> 00:27:50.480 align:start position:0%
figure
 
00:27:55.029 --> 00:27:55.039 align:start position:0%
out thank you further discussion line 17
 
00:27:59.830 --> 00:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
y representative Harry GTH yes um I am
 
00:28:02.909 --> 00:28:02.919 align:start position:0%
going to vote against this bill um I do
 
00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
truly believe that it does interfere
 
00:28:10.149 --> 00:28:10.159 align:start position:0%
with our 14 Amendment rights and also
 
00:28:13.070 --> 00:28:13.080 align:start position:0%
right now today that's handled by um the
 
00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
city or the town and I don't believe
 
00:28:17.590 --> 00:28:17.600 align:start position:0%
that we as the state body should be
 
00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:20.320 align:start position:0%
interfering with this
 
00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:23.440 align:start position:0%
situation thank you further discussion
 
00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:24.509 align:start position:0%
situation thank you further discussion
represent

00:28:24.509 --> 00:28:24.519 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:28:28.389 --> 00:28:28.399 align:start position:0%
M yeah um as always uh thank thank you
 
00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:30.320 align:start position:0%
for giving us these amendments uh you
 
00:28:31.990 --> 00:28:32.000 align:start position:0%
know right as we're starting executive
 
00:28:35.149 --> 00:28:35.159 align:start position:0%
sessions but uh in my my quick read of
 
00:28:37.190 --> 00:28:37.200 align:start position:0%
this and my comparison of some of the
 
00:28:38.909 --> 00:28:38.919 align:start position:0%
testimony that we received earlier on
 
00:28:41.669 --> 00:28:41.679 align:start position:0%
this bill um is that this amendment does
 
00:28:43.509 --> 00:28:43.519 align:start position:0%
not address the concerns that were
 
00:28:47.950 --> 00:28:47.960 align:start position:0%
raised during the public hearing um
 
00:28:52.110 --> 00:28:52.120 align:start position:0%
uh one of the things that uh uh one of
 
00:28:55.149 --> 00:28:55.159 align:start position:0%
the things that we heard uh the New
 
00:28:58.110 --> 00:28:58.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire School Board Association uh uh
 
00:29:03.149 --> 00:29:03.159 align:start position:0%
testify to is that the um that uh the
 
00:29:05.590 --> 00:29:05.600 align:start position:0%
school board or public body should not
 
00:29:09.029 --> 00:29:09.039 align:start position:0%
have to hold uh an an additional meeting
 
00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:10.840 align:start position:0%
uh for the purpose of the hearing that
 
00:29:13.029 --> 00:29:13.039 align:start position:0%
it can be held during the next regularly
 
00:29:14.950 --> 00:29:14.960 align:start position:0%
scheduled meeting this amendment does
 
00:29:17.710 --> 00:29:17.720 align:start position:0%
not appear to do that the vote is by a
 
00:29:21.310 --> 00:29:21.320 align:start position:0%
public uh Body by a simple majority this
 
00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:24.720 align:start position:0%
requires a 2third super majority there
 
00:29:27.430 --> 00:29:27.440 align:start position:0%
is no uh the School Board Association
 
00:29:30.430 --> 00:29:30.440 align:start position:0%
requested uh no appeal to Superior Court
 
00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:32.640 align:start position:0%
uh there is appeal to Superior Court in
 
00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:38.720 align:start position:0%
this um so you know I I think having
 
00:29:41.950 --> 00:29:41.960 align:start position:0%
guard rails around some of this is a is
 
00:29:44.870 --> 00:29:44.880 align:start position:0%
is a good idea but I think this needs it
 
00:29:47.110 --> 00:29:47.120 align:start position:0%
really does need some additional work
 
00:29:50.549 --> 00:29:50.559 align:start position:0%
given the the fact that virtually no one
 
00:29:52.190 --> 00:29:52.200 align:start position:0%
I don't think anybody aside from the
 
00:29:55.070 --> 00:29:55.080 align:start position:0%
sponsor testified in favor of this bill
 
00:29:56.669 --> 00:29:56.679 align:start position:0%
um and the amendment that we have is
 
00:29:59.029 --> 00:29:59.039 align:start position:0%
from the same sponsor and it doesn't
 
00:30:01.029 --> 00:30:01.039 align:start position:0%
address the concerns that were raised in
 
00:30:01.039 --> 00:30:02.110 align:start position:0%
address the concerns that were raised in
the

00:30:02.110 --> 00:30:02.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:30:04.350 --> 00:30:04.360 align:start position:0%
hearing thank you I I would say that the
 
00:30:06.389 --> 00:30:06.399 align:start position:0%
concerns were raised only by the school
 
00:30:08.830 --> 00:30:08.840 align:start position:0%
board and um our caucus doesn't work for
 
00:30:09.909 --> 00:30:09.919 align:start position:0%
the school board so we're going to go
 
00:30:11.230 --> 00:30:11.240 align:start position:0%
ahead and vote without it I would
 
00:30:13.509 --> 00:30:13.519 align:start position:0%
disagree so I would go ahead and the
 
00:30:15.549 --> 00:30:15.559 align:start position:0%
director of theing I didn't ask you to
 
00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:17.360 align:start position:0%
you will not speak until I allow you to
 
00:30:20.350 --> 00:30:20.360 align:start position:0%
speak I did not recognize you to speak
 
00:30:21.830 --> 00:30:21.840 align:start position:0%

the amendment um basically nothing's
 
00:58:07.870 --> 00:58:07.880 align:start position:0%
changed this just makes it so
 
00:58:11.069 --> 00:58:11.079 align:start position:0%
that military protective orders are
 
00:58:14.710 --> 00:58:14.720 align:start position:0%
admissible in our
 
00:58:17.309 --> 00:58:17.319 align:start position:0%
proceedings towards getting as evidence
 
00:58:19.390 --> 00:58:19.400 align:start position:0%
towards another protective order in the
 
00:58:21.309 --> 00:58:21.319 align:start position:0%
Civil Court would you like to speak to
 
00:58:24.589 --> 00:58:24.599 align:start position:0%
your second no thank you further
 
00:58:26.870 --> 00:58:26.880 align:start position:0%
discussion on House Bill 6 to amendment
 
00:58:29.309 --> 00:58:29.319 align:start position:0%
number 282
 
00:58:31.789 --> 00:58:31.799 align:start position:0%
H representative Harry
 
00:58:34.990 --> 00:58:35.000 align:start position:0%
G since this is replacing that can you
 
00:58:37.549 --> 00:58:37.559 align:start position:0%
give us a moment just read through
 
00:58:40.670 --> 00:58:40.680 align:start position:0%
it it's replacing what was originally
 
00:58:42.510 --> 00:58:42.520 align:start position:0%
given to us
 
00:58:55.029 --> 00:58:55.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:38.470 --> 00:59:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:55.029 --> 00:59:55.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:55.039 --> 01:00:24.950 align:start position:0%
 
is

01:00:24.950 --> 01:00:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:12.870 --> 01:01:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:13.910 align:start position:0%
 
this

01:01:13.910 --> 01:01:13.920 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:01:16.150 --> 01:01:16.160 align:start position:0%
isn't the problem that I'm having with
 
01:01:18.589 --> 01:01:18.599 align:start position:0%
this is where do we draw that line I
 
01:01:20.990 --> 01:01:21.000 align:start position:0%
wrote myself notes because I mean I'm
 
01:01:23.670 --> 01:01:23.680 align:start position:0%
probably going to say yes would but I'm
 
01:01:26.670 --> 01:01:26.680 align:start position:0%
struggling with it because you Dro a
 
01:01:28.109 --> 01:01:28.119 align:start position:0%
line between the local government and
 
01:01:29.750 --> 01:01:29.760 align:start position:0%
federal government so today we don't
 
01:01:31.870 --> 01:01:31.880 align:start position:0%
want no federal government in things
 
01:01:34.349 --> 01:01:34.359 align:start position:0%
then now we get something now we say yes
 
01:01:54.829 --> 01:01:54.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:54.839 --> 01:02:24.829 align:start position:0%
 
that

01:02:24.829 --> 01:02:24.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:24.839 --> 01:02:54.829 align:start position:0%
 
e

01:02:54.829 --> 01:02:54.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:54.839 --> 01:03:24.750 align:start position:0%
 
e

01:03:24.750 --> 01:03:24.760 align:start position:0%

01:04:17.510 --> 01:04:17.520 align:start position:0%

01:05:17.950 --> 01:05:17.960 align:start position:0%
Ro you like to speak to your motion yes
 
01:05:20.390 --> 01:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
government efficiency is the the word of
 
01:05:22.069 --> 01:05:22.079 align:start position:0%
the day and I think we'd all be very
 
01:05:24.190 --> 01:05:24.200 align:start position:0%
interested in finding out exactly what
 
01:05:25.390 --> 01:05:25.400 align:start position:0%
our federal what the federal government
 
01:05:26.870 --> 01:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
is do in our
 
01:05:29.109 --> 01:05:29.119 align:start position:0%
state thank you representative Ro you
 
01:05:30.789 --> 01:05:30.799 align:start position:0%
like to speak to your second no thank
 
01:05:33.789 --> 01:05:33.799 align:start position:0%
you any further
 
01:05:40.109 --> 01:05:40.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:44.190 --> 01:05:44.200 align:start position:0%
GA no um when I look at this I I I'm
 
01:05:45.950 --> 01:05:45.960 align:start position:0%
really struggling with it to be honest
 
01:05:49.069 --> 01:05:49.079 align:start position:0%
with you um and then I looked at the
 
01:05:52.829 --> 01:05:52.839 align:start position:0%
cost to the state with possibly three
 
01:05:56.390 --> 01:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
positions and from my understanding
 
01:05:58.109 --> 01:05:58.119 align:start position:0%
um we're struggling with the budget as
 
01:06:00.990 --> 01:06:01.000 align:start position:0%
it is um I don't think that I can vote
 
01:06:03.430 --> 01:06:03.440 align:start position:0%
for this
 
01:06:06.390 --> 01:06:06.400 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to say no to this one I
 
01:06:10.510 --> 01:06:10.520 align:start position:0%
can't accept it thank you um I also was
 
01:06:13.430 --> 01:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
concerned about the cost however um we
 
01:06:15.990 --> 01:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
are a policy committee and I believe
 
01:06:17.390 --> 01:06:17.400 align:start position:0%
that they're going to have to figure out
 
01:06:19.309 --> 01:06:19.319 align:start position:0%
the whether or not that that's an
 
01:06:21.750 --> 01:06:21.760 align:start position:0%
accurate estimate I I just I find it
 
01:06:24.269 --> 01:06:24.279 align:start position:0%
difficult to wrap my mind around needing
 
01:06:26.230 --> 01:06:26.240 align:start position:0%
basically an entire Legal Office office
 
01:06:27.789 --> 01:06:27.799 align:start position:0%
just to collect the documents of what
 
01:06:29.309 --> 01:06:29.319 align:start position:0%
the federal government's doing as far as
 
01:06:31.589 --> 01:06:31.599 align:start position:0%
law enforcement in our state to pass it
 
01:06:34.269 --> 01:06:34.279 align:start position:0%
on to us um but I I'll leave that to
 
01:06:36.309 --> 01:06:36.319 align:start position:0%
finance to figure out between them and
 
01:06:38.670 --> 01:06:38.680 align:start position:0%
the um Department of Justice
 
01:06:42.269 --> 01:06:42.279 align:start position:0%
representative Murray thank you chairman
 
01:06:45.349 --> 01:06:45.359 align:start position:0%
um yeah I agree that um I would love to
 
01:06:47.430 --> 01:06:47.440 align:start position:0%
know everything the federal government
 
01:06:50.710 --> 01:06:50.720 align:start position:0%
is doing in our state I do think um the
 
01:06:53.750 --> 01:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
quarterly reports is maybe where it gets
 
01:06:56.390 --> 01:06:56.400 align:start position:0%
a little too um over burdening to the
 
01:06:58.109 --> 01:06:58.119 align:start position:0%
AG's office especially we're trying not
 
01:07:02.589 --> 01:07:02.599 align:start position:0%
to supply um more staff there um just
 
01:07:04.750 --> 01:07:04.760 align:start position:0%
because of the time considering the
 
01:07:07.109 --> 01:07:07.119 align:start position:0%
amount of um divisions there are that
 
01:07:08.549 --> 01:07:08.559 align:start position:0%
they would have to reach out to and that
 
01:07:10.990 --> 01:07:11.000 align:start position:0%
we have no control over where they're
 
01:07:12.630 --> 01:07:12.640 align:start position:0%
over whether they're going to respond or
 
01:07:14.990 --> 01:07:15.000 align:start position:0%
not so having the AG's office have to go
 
01:07:16.950 --> 01:07:16.960 align:start position:0%
through this whole like RMA rule every 3
 
01:07:19.230 --> 01:07:19.240 align:start position:0%
months I think um could potentially be
 
01:07:21.230 --> 01:07:21.240 align:start position:0%
too much to start with I feel like if
 
01:07:23.029 --> 01:07:23.039 align:start position:0%
this was like every six months or once a
 
01:07:24.910 --> 01:07:24.920 align:start position:0%
year I would be more likely to support
 
01:07:28.109 --> 01:07:28.119 align:start position:0%
it but um I like the the thought the
 
01:07:28.119 --> 01:07:29.109 align:start position:0%
it but um I like the the thought the
idea

01:07:29.109 --> 01:07:29.119 align:start position:0%
idea
 
01:07:33.029 --> 01:07:33.039 align:start position:0%
behind thank you further discussion
 
01:07:33.039 --> 01:07:37.269 align:start position:0%
behind thank you further discussion
representative

01:07:37.269 --> 01:07:37.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:39.190 --> 01:07:39.200 align:start position:0%
Muse one of the reasons I'm going to
 
01:07:41.190 --> 01:07:41.200 align:start position:0%
vote against this bill is I'm not 100%
 
01:07:44.269 --> 01:07:44.279 align:start position:0%
sure what it actually accomplishes um
 
01:07:46.309 --> 01:07:46.319 align:start position:0%
this is information that I already that
 
01:07:48.029 --> 01:07:48.039 align:start position:0%
I understand is already published by the
 
01:07:51.349 --> 01:07:51.359 align:start position:0%
federal government um it seems to just
 
01:07:53.870 --> 01:07:53.880 align:start position:0%
put an unnecessary burden on the
 
01:07:55.910 --> 01:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office and an
 
01:07:58.269 --> 01:07:58.279 align:start position:0%
unnecessary burden that costs money in a
 
01:08:01.190 --> 01:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
budget year um and I think the other
 
01:08:04.710 --> 01:08:04.720 align:start position:0%
thing uh that I notice as a frequent
 
01:08:07.069 --> 01:08:07.079 align:start position:0%
user of virtually all of our agency
 
01:08:10.390 --> 01:08:10.400 align:start position:0%
websites is uh one of the hardest things
 
01:08:12.309 --> 01:08:12.319 align:start position:0%
to do in the state of New Hampshire is
 
01:08:15.030 --> 01:08:15.040 align:start position:0%
to find anything on any of our agency
 
01:08:18.829 --> 01:08:18.839 align:start position:0%
websites and if I was to invest
 
01:08:23.990 --> 01:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
$200,000 um uh in in uh improving the
 
01:08:27.550 --> 01:08:27.560 align:start position:0%
experience of of V ERS uh uh in this
 
01:08:30.349 --> 01:08:30.359 align:start position:0%
state on our agency websites I would put
 
01:08:34.669 --> 01:08:34.679 align:start position:0%
it into some uh web design and feedback
 
01:08:36.910 --> 01:08:36.920 align:start position:0%
on and how to make it easier to use and
 
01:08:39.309 --> 01:08:39.319 align:start position:0%
one thing I might do is actually put in
 
01:08:41.789 --> 01:08:41.799 align:start position:0%
a usable search engine which none of our
 
01:08:44.709 --> 01:08:44.719 align:start position:0%
agency websites seem to have so the
 
01:08:46.349 --> 01:08:46.359 align:start position:0%
bottom line is there are heck of a lot
 
01:08:48.910 --> 01:08:48.920 align:start position:0%
better ways to spend
 
01:08:53.030 --> 01:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
$250,000 than on uh uh information
 
01:08:57.870 --> 01:08:57.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:57.880 --> 01:08:58.950 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:08:58.950 --> 01:08:58.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:09:02.630 --> 01:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
Newman yeah I just have a question about
 
01:09:05.149 --> 01:09:05.159 align:start position:0%
uh line number five that says the
 
01:09:06.990 --> 01:09:07.000 align:start position:0%
Attorney General shall formally request
 
01:09:08.630 --> 01:09:08.640 align:start position:0%
that the federal government and agencies
 
01:09:09.709 --> 01:09:09.719 align:start position:0%
with law
 
01:09:12.030 --> 01:09:12.040 align:start position:0%
enforcement uh investigatory and
 
01:09:13.990 --> 01:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
operational activities
 
01:09:16.229 --> 01:09:16.239 align:start position:0%
voluntarily provide the following
 
01:09:20.269 --> 01:09:20.279 align:start position:0%
aggregated data and what happens if the
 
01:09:22.390 --> 01:09:22.400 align:start position:0%
uh federal government just does not
 
01:09:24.870 --> 01:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
voluntarily do that I'm not sure what
 
01:09:25.910 --> 01:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:09:28.349 --> 01:09:28.359 align:start position:0%
says happens then well I don't think
 
01:09:29.709 --> 01:09:29.719 align:start position:0%
anything happens I don't think we can
 
01:09:31.229 --> 01:09:31.239 align:start position:0%
make the federal government do anything
 
01:09:33.349 --> 01:09:33.359 align:start position:0%
I think what this would bill would do is
 
01:09:36.390 --> 01:09:36.400 align:start position:0%
um mandate our attorney general to ask
 
01:09:37.910 --> 01:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
the federal government if the federal
 
01:09:43.510 --> 01:09:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:46.189 --> 01:09:46.199 align:start position:0%
no further discussion representative
 
01:09:49.829 --> 01:09:49.839 align:start position:0%
share uh it's a combination of the cost
 
01:09:51.430 --> 01:09:51.440 align:start position:0%
understanding that Finance hopefully
 
01:09:53.390 --> 01:09:53.400 align:start position:0%
will sort that out combination of the
 
01:09:56.430 --> 01:09:56.440 align:start position:0%
cost and having some body let's assume
 
01:10:00.189 --> 01:10:00.199 align:start position:0%
the cost is validated having someone's
 
01:10:03.910 --> 01:10:03.920 align:start position:0%
every 3 months uh ask the federal
 
01:10:06.470 --> 01:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
government for X Y and Z all the
 
01:10:08.630 --> 01:10:08.640 align:start position:0%
agencies and them saying not even
 
01:10:10.189 --> 01:10:10.199 align:start position:0%
responding I
 
01:10:13.310 --> 01:10:13.320 align:start position:0%
just I like I very much like the idea
 
01:10:15.470 --> 01:10:15.480 align:start position:0%
but I just I'm just not sure it's worth
 
01:10:18.630 --> 01:10:18.640 align:start position:0%
the cost assuming the cost is
 
01:10:21.750 --> 01:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
valid I assume the answer would probably
 
01:10:23.550 --> 01:10:23.560 align:start position:0%
be more along the lines of what
 
01:10:25.430 --> 01:10:25.440 align:start position:0%
representative Newman thinks it's going
 
01:10:27.270 --> 01:10:27.280 align:start position:0%
to be and there would be no cost because
 
01:10:29.790 --> 01:10:29.800 align:start position:0%
there'd be no information forthcoming
 
01:10:32.270 --> 01:10:32.280 align:start position:0%
yeah I think I think the the the problem
 
01:10:35.709 --> 01:10:35.719 align:start position:0%
is they're still required to find all
 
01:10:37.830 --> 01:10:37.840 align:start position:0%
the agencies operating in the state and
 
01:10:40.110 --> 01:10:40.120 align:start position:0%
sending the letter out so that they can
 
01:10:42.070 --> 01:10:42.080 align:start position:0%
collect the non-answer that and that
 
01:10:46.110 --> 01:10:46.120 align:start position:0%
just seems a waste of time further
 
01:10:48.350 --> 01:10:48.360 align:start position:0%

01:14:17.350 --> 01:14:17.360 align:start position:0%
recognize representative Sher for a
 
01:14:20.510 --> 01:14:20.520 align:start position:0%
motion I move out to pass I second would
 
01:14:22.790 --> 01:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
you like to speak to your motion uh yes
 
01:14:27.750 --> 01:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:31.229 --> 01:14:31.239 align:start position:0%
six or seven years ago the uh the
 
01:14:34.709 --> 01:14:34.719 align:start position:0%
legislature passed a bill in which uh
 
01:14:37.550 --> 01:14:37.560 align:start position:0%
somebody who stopped his car is stopped
 
01:14:41.110 --> 01:14:41.120 align:start position:0%
by the police and uh the police asked
 
01:14:43.830 --> 01:14:43.840 align:start position:0%
for the consent to search the car uh
 
01:14:46.149 --> 01:14:46.159 align:start position:0%
they needed to inform the person that
 
01:14:48.189 --> 01:14:48.199 align:start position:0%
they did not had a constitutional right
 
01:14:51.390 --> 01:14:51.400 align:start position:0%
not to consent and uh that wouldn't be
 
01:14:53.910 --> 01:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
used against them uh and if they agreed
 
01:14:55.629 --> 01:14:55.639 align:start position:0%
to consent they would have to sign a
 
01:14:58.950 --> 01:14:58.960 align:start position:0%
form that's been in place for I want to
 
01:15:02.189 --> 01:15:02.199 align:start position:0%
say six or seven years uh I've heard no
 
01:15:04.669 --> 01:15:04.679 align:start position:0%
reports of any problems with that this
 
01:15:07.229 --> 01:15:07.239 align:start position:0%
simply expands that to include searches
 
01:15:10.110 --> 01:15:10.120 align:start position:0%
of houses and other property with the
 
01:15:14.229 --> 01:15:14.239 align:start position:0%
same procedure uh it's uh it's really at
 
01:15:17.189 --> 01:15:17.199 align:start position:0%
this point just a matter of uh tweaking
 
01:15:19.390 --> 01:15:19.400 align:start position:0%
the form that's already in place I've
 
01:15:22.430 --> 01:15:22.440 align:start position:0%
talked with the chief in in uh Portsmith
 
01:15:24.390 --> 01:15:24.400 align:start position:0%
and he said they've they were already
 
01:15:26.750 --> 01:15:26.760 align:start position:0%
doing it any anyway and they've had no
 
01:15:29.070 --> 01:15:29.080 align:start position:0%
problems with the
 
01:15:31.470 --> 01:15:31.480 align:start position:0%
process thank you I I seem to remember
 
01:15:33.390 --> 01:15:33.400 align:start position:0%
that bill you were talking about um
 
01:15:35.950 --> 01:15:35.960 align:start position:0%
can't remember if I think I might have
 
01:15:37.430 --> 01:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
actually wrote that bill is that the one
 
01:15:39.110 --> 01:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
we're talking about I'm sorry the the
 
01:15:40.590 --> 01:15:40.600 align:start position:0%
bill you were referencing from six or
 
01:15:42.950 --> 01:15:42.960 align:start position:0%
seven years ago that's the one that I I
 
01:15:44.430 --> 01:15:44.440 align:start position:0%
wrote that didn't I you did okay thank
 
01:15:46.830 --> 01:15:46.840 align:start position:0%
you you and Senator French that's right
 
01:15:50.189 --> 01:15:50.199 align:start position:0%
um and I I think this is anytime we can
 
01:15:54.030 --> 01:15:54.040 align:start position:0%
use the government more more for
 
01:15:56.030 --> 01:15:56.040 align:start position:0%
educational purpos purp than than
 
01:15:57.990 --> 01:15:58.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement purposes or both at the same
 
01:16:00.430 --> 01:16:00.440 align:start position:0%
time we should so by having law
 
01:16:02.229 --> 01:16:02.239 align:start position:0%
enforcement remind people of their
 
01:16:05.870 --> 01:16:05.880 align:start position:0%
rights um I in my opinion is not a bad
 
01:16:08.229 --> 01:16:08.239 align:start position:0%
thing um especially when it comes to
 
01:16:10.550 --> 01:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
searching their their most private areas
 
01:16:12.790 --> 01:16:12.800 align:start position:0%
of their house and things of that nature
 
01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:15.590 align:start position:0%
of their house and things of that nature
further
