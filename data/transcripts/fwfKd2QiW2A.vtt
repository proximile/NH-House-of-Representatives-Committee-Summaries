00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:03.240 align:start position:0%
um the the one drafting attorney we have
 
00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 align:start position:0%
left that's been here for more than 15
 
00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 align:start position:0%
that didn't it just didn't happen so I
 
00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry about that I that's okay I
 
00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 align:start position:0%
can't I fought the law and the law won
 
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.970 align:start position:0%
can't I fought the law and the law won
so

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 align:start position:0%
um literally
 
00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 align:start position:0%
but yeah the
 
00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 align:start position:0%
so just to just to reiterate the
 
00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 align:start position:0%
the parts that were not applicable to
 
00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 align:start position:0%
group one and the parts that were not
 
00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 align:start position:0%
applicable to group two I.E teachers
 
00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 align:start position:0%
firemen the things that should be there
 
00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 align:start position:0%
the language cleanup if you will
 
00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 align:start position:0%
um that's all been there
 
00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 align:start position:0%
the we changed the 85 percent to 100 I
 
00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 align:start position:0%
saw yeah yep the request from
 
00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire was added at the
 
00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 align:start position:0%
uh on that portion and
 
00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 align:start position:0%
that was pretty much it the rest like
 
00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 align:start position:0%
that was the only substantive change was
 
00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 align:start position:0%
her request and then the rest was
 
00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 align:start position:0%
language cleanup so
 
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.590 align:start position:0%
language cleanup so
um

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.209 align:start position:0%
um
seems

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 align:start position:0%
seems
 
00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 align:start position:0%
it seems as though they did what we
 
00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 align:start position:0%
asked I didn't I couldn't see any other
 
00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 align:start position:0%
I didn't see anything else myself other
 
00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 align:start position:0%
than the Bolding part which you know
 
00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 align:start position:0%
it's just what I wanted so it doesn't
 
00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 align:start position:0%
really matter so
 
00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 align:start position:0%
read the amendment and on pay part one
 
00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 align:start position:0%
page one
 
00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 align:start position:0%
on line six and seven
 
00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 align:start position:0%
the original line said
 
00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 align:start position:0%
that the this expands what was in the
 
00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:42.900 align:start position:0%
draft amendment to include the
 
00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 align:start position:0%
calculations of earnable compensation
 
00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 align:start position:0%
and average final compensation which is
 
00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 align:start position:0%
okay because that's they're different
 
00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 align:start position:0%
and then it says cannot be reduced
 
00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 align:start position:0%
the previous version was cannot be
 
00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.170 align:start position:0%
the previous version was cannot be
changed

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 align:start position:0%
well perhaps
 
00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 align:start position:0%
they misinterpreted it but the amendment
 
00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 align:start position:0%
that I looked at did specifically say
 
00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.770 align:start position:0%
that I looked at did specifically say
changed

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 align:start position:0%
changed
 
00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 align:start position:0%
and so I want to make sure that we know
 
00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 align:start position:0%
what we're doing with this because that
 
00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 align:start position:0%
the version of the amendment that we
 
00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 align:start position:0%
were working from at the subcommittee
 
00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:31.190 align:start position:0%
were working from at the subcommittee
meeting

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 align:start position:0%
had changed
 
00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:37.379 align:start position:0%
this has reduced and whether or not
 
00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:41.879 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson meant reduced
 
00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 align:start position:0%
that wasn't what it it said so if that's
 
00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 align:start position:0%
what what we want to do that's one thing
 
00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 align:start position:0%
that's kind of an awkward phrasing going
 
00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 align:start position:0%
to agree the idea because it says the
 
00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 align:start position:0%
calculation cannot be reduced from you
 
00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 align:start position:0%
know like I never heard that before I
 
00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 align:start position:0%
mean you get what they're talking about
 
00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 align:start position:0%
I can show you the first draft in print
 
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 align:start position:0%
it says reduced
 
00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 align:start position:0%
it does yeah I'm looking at the second
 
00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 align:start position:0%
draft I'm looking at the second draft
 
00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 align:start position:0%
too Carolyn it does say reduced on mine
 
00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 align:start position:0%
all right fine I I misinterpreted that's
 
00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 align:start position:0%
right the point still stands like the
 
00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 align:start position:0%
point's still significant that is a
 
00:03:23.149 --> 00:03:23.159 align:start position:0%
that's one of the significant policy
 
00:03:26.149 --> 00:03:26.159 align:start position:0%
decisions that this includes it's not
 
00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:31.519 align:start position:0%
just the elimination of the table and uh
 
00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:35.879 align:start position:0%
consolidating everyone into the a vested
 
00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 align:start position:0%
category essentially we're saying that
 
00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 align:start position:0%
we won't change or we won't reduce
 
00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 align:start position:0%
a pension after three years which
 
00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 align:start position:0%
implies that there's a essentially a
 
00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 align:start position:0%
three-year probationary period where it
 
00:03:52.369 --> 00:03:52.379 align:start position:0%
can be changed and then it can't
 
00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 align:start position:0%
so if that's what policy if that's the
 
00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 align:start position:0%
policy we want to adopt
 
00:03:58.019 --> 00:03:58.729 align:start position:0%
policy we want to adopt
um

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.080 align:start position:0%
great I mean I think yeah it's a policy
 
00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 align:start position:0%
decision but it will mean that if we if
 
00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 align:start position:0%
any changes are ever made
 
00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 align:start position:0%
due to another collapse in the market or
 
00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 align:start position:0%
whatever so that we have to make changes
 
00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 align:start position:0%
it will it will be a a pretty clear
 
00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 align:start position:0%
and obvious non um you know violation of
 
00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 align:start position:0%
of of a promise the other promises were
 
00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:27.479 align:start position:0%
the other the promise is that the
 
00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 align:start position:0%
people who have been testifying were in
 
00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:33.540 align:start position:0%
other documents they weren't in law
 
00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 align:start position:0%
but this is a specific promise in law
 
00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:38.639 align:start position:0%
that we're making so we should be aware
 
00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 align:start position:0%
and good luck
 
00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 align:start position:0%
so one of the one of the things with
 
00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 align:start position:0%
that is that if if the word reduced is
 
00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 align:start position:0%
is modified to changed
 
00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
then this bill can't happen because
 
00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 align:start position:0%
after this is a 10-year plan so after
 
00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 align:start position:0%
three years the plan would shut off
 
00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:05.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm I'm just thinking about the
 
00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:09.600 align:start position:0%
conversation that we were having earlier
 
00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
um if if the plan is written in law
 
00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 align:start position:0%
which it is I mean the agreement is
 
00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 align:start position:0%
written in law when when the person
 
00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 align:start position:0%
signs on uh to their personal pension
 
00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.110 align:start position:0%
signs on uh to their personal pension
plan

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:20.120 align:start position:0%
plan
 
00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:21.710 align:start position:0%
plan
and

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:21.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:23.639 align:start position:0%
if you're correct in saying that that
 
00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:25.740 align:start position:0%
plan cannot be retroactively changed
 
00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:28.620 align:start position:0%
which seems reasonable to me that
 
00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:30.720 align:start position:0%
provision may also be in conflict with
 
00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:32.460 align:start position:0%
with that idea because this would seem
 
00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:35.280 align:start position:0%
to insinuate that we could retroactively
 
00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:39.300 align:start position:0%
change that in year two so I agree with
 
00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:43.380 align:start position:0%
you that so that is a in Most states
 
00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:45.780 align:start position:0%
they have the ability there is a little
 
00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:48.720 align:start position:0%
bit of a probationary period that exists
 
00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:52.860 align:start position:0%
so this addresses two elements of that
 
00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:55.800 align:start position:0%
it doesn't address into reference
 
00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:57.960 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire's point in the
 
00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:00.180 align:start position:0%
event of an issue
 
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
um the the contributions that meant that
 
00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:04.919 align:start position:0%
the workers have to pay in is not
 
00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:06.720 align:start position:0%
protected that can be adjusted and
 
00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.450 align:start position:0%
protected that can be adjusted and
modified

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:08.460 align:start position:0%
modified
 
00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:11.240 align:start position:0%
um the areas of the cap can be modified
 
00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:14.340 align:start position:0%
so this this is just saying that you
 
00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:15.900 align:start position:0%
know when you're when you're coming to
 
00:06:17.749 --> 00:06:17.759 align:start position:0%
work and you think that
 
00:06:20.029 --> 00:06:20.039 align:start position:0%
okay this is the duration of time that I
 
00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:21.419 align:start position:0%
need to do and this is how they figure
 
00:06:23.629 --> 00:06:23.639 align:start position:0%
that out
 
00:06:26.749 --> 00:06:26.759 align:start position:0%
that that element of it really should be
 
00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:28.740 align:start position:0%
locked in in people's minds because
 
00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:31.620 align:start position:0%
they're agreeing to take service under
 
00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:33.060 align:start position:0%
this idea and this is how we got into
 
00:06:34.969 --> 00:06:34.979 align:start position:0%
this entire mess in the first place yeah
 
00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:37.560 align:start position:0%
so what this is saying is that you know
 
00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:38.450 align:start position:0%
so what this is saying is that you know
what

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:38.460 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:42.300 align:start position:0%
because we have a longer than average
 
00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:45.960 align:start position:0%
vesting period whereas for the six New
 
00:06:48.469 --> 00:06:48.479 align:start position:0%
England states vested five years we we
 
00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:51.660 align:start position:0%
require 10. this provides some stability
 
00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:54.680 align:start position:0%
to say you know what under traditional
 
00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:57.180 align:start position:0%
concepts of vesting
 
00:06:59.090 --> 00:06:59.100 align:start position:0%
if we can go back and change your
 
00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
conditions at nine years that's the
 
00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:03.780 align:start position:0%
exact problem we're in right now I don't
 
00:07:05.749 --> 00:07:05.759 align:start position:0%
want to repeat that problem again in the
 
00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:08.220 align:start position:0%
future so this is this is a the the
 
00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:11.160 align:start position:0%
three-year ask here is a bit of a it's a
 
00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:13.080 align:start position:0%
reputation repair it's a credibility
 
00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:16.500 align:start position:0%
repair on the part of the state to say
 
00:07:18.469 --> 00:07:18.479 align:start position:0%
you know what after you've given three
 
00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:20.280 align:start position:0%
years of commitment to us we're going to
 
00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:22.380 align:start position:0%
give commitment to you and say
 
00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:25.860 align:start position:0%
that you're you're in so but but well
 
00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:27.240 align:start position:0%
not even necessarily you're in because
 
00:07:28.969 --> 00:07:28.979 align:start position:0%
you're not vested but you're you know
 
00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:30.240 align:start position:0%
we're not going to change your average
 
00:07:32.029 --> 00:07:32.039 align:start position:0%
we're not compensation rates exactly
 
00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:33.060 align:start position:0%
sorry I shouldn't have said yeah
 
00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:34.969 align:start position:0%
sorry I shouldn't have said yeah
clarification

00:07:34.969 --> 00:07:34.979 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
00:07:34.979 --> 00:07:36.589 align:start position:0%
clarification
um

00:07:36.589 --> 00:07:36.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
that that's the that's the idea there
 
00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:41.580 align:start position:0%
it's it's a it's we you've committed now
 
00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:43.500 align:start position:0%
we've committed now again like I said
 
00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:46.080 align:start position:0%
before in last work session you know
 
00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:48.900 align:start position:0%
these are careers they're not jobs
 
00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
I'm not
 
00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:52.560 align:start position:0%
pushing or advocating for us to go to a
 
00:07:55.189 --> 00:07:55.199 align:start position:0%
five-year vesting that involves like a
 
00:07:56.689 --> 00:07:56.699 align:start position:0%
lot of money and a lot of other things
 
00:07:58.309 --> 00:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
so just just for sake of time can I stop
 
00:07:59.510 --> 00:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
you for that sure
 
00:08:01.309 --> 00:08:01.319 align:start position:0%
um any questions from anybody on the
 
00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:03.360 align:start position:0%
committee at this point either about
 
00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:05.400 align:start position:0%
this three-year thing or comments
 
00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
concerns anything because we don't have
 
00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:08.220 align:start position:0%
a tremendous amount of time this morning
 
00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:10.800 align:start position:0%
yeah representative Davis
 
00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:12.240 align:start position:0%
I was I
 
00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:14.340 align:start position:0%
I'm new on the committee and all of this
 
00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:16.440 align:start position:0%
stuff is very new to me I was just
 
00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:17.450 align:start position:0%
stuff is very new to me I was just
wondering

00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:17.460 align:start position:0%
wondering
 
00:08:19.129 --> 00:08:19.139 align:start position:0%
this is well thought out and well
 
00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:21.960 align:start position:0%
written I was just wondering why it took
 
00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:24.840 align:start position:0%
so long just to straighten it out
 
00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:28.620 align:start position:0%
well you have um political wins blow in
 
00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:31.080 align:start position:0%
a different direction sometimes
 
00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:33.170 align:start position:0%
a different direction sometimes
and

00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:33.180 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:37.020 align:start position:0%
um that's the most neutral answer I can
 
00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:38.520 align:start position:0%
give you
 
00:08:41.149 --> 00:08:41.159 align:start position:0%
uh difference differences of opinion and
 
00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:45.180 align:start position:0%
philosophy uh as to when lines should be
 
00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:46.610 align:start position:0%
philosophy uh as to when lines should be
drawn

00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:46.620 align:start position:0%
drawn
 
00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
um so there are people who believe that
 
00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:49.800 align:start position:0%
drawing the line at the point of
 
00:08:51.769 --> 00:08:51.779 align:start position:0%
vestment was a completely fine thing to
 
00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:54.180 align:start position:0%
do and retroactively doing this and
 
00:08:55.850 --> 00:08:55.860 align:start position:0%
there are people who think that that's
 
00:08:57.769 --> 00:08:57.779 align:start position:0%
retroactive law and shouldn't have been
 
00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:00.180 align:start position:0%
done and you know benefits shouldn't be
 
00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:03.720 align:start position:0%
changed so the kind of debate has waged
 
00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:05.220 align:start position:0%
over the years as to what was
 
00:09:07.210 --> 00:09:07.220 align:start position:0%
appropriate and what wasn't appropriate
 
00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:09.360 align:start position:0%
another the other thing too with this
 
00:09:11.269 --> 00:09:11.279 align:start position:0%
two representative is that there was
 
00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:14.160 align:start position:0%
when when this all came to happen there
 
00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:16.140 align:start position:0%
was a bit of a national craze going on
 
00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:18.660 align:start position:0%
all the states were looking at it we had
 
00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
some really bizarre media hype that
 
00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:24.120 align:start position:0%
surrounded it and now that we have I
 
00:09:26.269 --> 00:09:26.279 align:start position:0%
guess the benefit of some some 2020
 
00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:28.320 align:start position:0%
Vision looking back over the last decade
 
00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:30.240 align:start position:0%
there are other states that have gone
 
00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:33.360 align:start position:0%
back and made changes and reverted back
 
00:09:35.389 --> 00:09:35.399 align:start position:0%
to Old benefits because they they got
 
00:09:36.769 --> 00:09:36.779 align:start position:0%
caught up in the craze too and realized
 
00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:38.760 align:start position:0%
hey we just went too far we just went
 
00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
too far so
 
00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:42.420 align:start position:0%
there's I think there's an element of
 
00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:44.160 align:start position:0%
that where you can just you can look at
 
00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:46.440 align:start position:0%
what you did and go eh you know what
 
00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:48.360 align:start position:0%
this we had some unintended consequences
 
00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:50.760 align:start position:0%
here as well
 
00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
anybody else
 
00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:54.420 align:start position:0%
uh yes representative true and then
 
00:09:57.889 --> 00:09:57.899 align:start position:0%
representative uh thank you Mr chair so
 
00:10:00.769 --> 00:10:00.779 align:start position:0%
uh on uh
 
00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:04.140 align:start position:0%
on the on my on the not reduced after
 
00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:07.140 align:start position:0%
three years line page one five through
 
00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:08.870 align:start position:0%
three years line page one five through
seven

00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
seven
 
00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:09.590 align:start position:0%
seven
um

00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:13.560 align:start position:0%
that is only that's only referring to
 
00:10:16.009 --> 00:10:16.019 align:start position:0%
the people affected by the entire change
 
00:10:18.829 --> 00:10:18.839 align:start position:0%
the 1700 people no no that would be
 
00:10:18.839 --> 00:10:20.030 align:start position:0%
the 1700 people no no that would be
everybody

00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:20.040 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
00:10:21.769 --> 00:10:21.779 align:start position:0%
so that's the people affected by the
 
00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:23.640 align:start position:0%
change the people who were in The Old
 
00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:25.200 align:start position:0%
system and the people in the new system
 
00:10:29.449 --> 00:10:29.459 align:start position:0%
so post 2012 after 2012. is only
 
00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:31.320 align:start position:0%
speaking to group two
 
00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:33.060 align:start position:0%
it is only speaking to group two I
 
00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:34.670 align:start position:0%
it is only speaking to group two I
believe

00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:34.680 align:start position:0%
believe
 
00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:35.329 align:start position:0%
believe
yeah

00:10:35.329 --> 00:10:35.339 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:38.220 align:start position:0%
um RSA 100 because it is specific to
 
00:10:42.769 --> 00:10:42.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:45.769 --> 00:10:45.779 align:start position:0%
only group two uh that's the art well as
 
00:10:47.329 --> 00:10:47.339 align:start position:0%
far as I can tell I mean let me let me
 
00:10:48.769 --> 00:10:48.779 align:start position:0%
dive in here a little bit just to see
 
00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
this may let me look that up Chris
 
00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:54.300 align:start position:0%
no it would it would apply to both
 
00:10:56.449 --> 00:10:56.459 align:start position:0%
groups because it's because as it's
 
00:10:59.269 --> 00:10:59.279 align:start position:0%
written it's the Roman numeral which
 
00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:01.980 align:start position:0%
which encompasses the
 
00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:03.720 align:start position:0%
um once this goes into effect though
 
00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:06.240 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah because it because there's no
 
00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:07.140 align:start position:0%
sub paragraph oh there's no sub
 
00:11:08.509 --> 00:11:08.519 align:start position:0%
paragraphs you're right no it's just
 
00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:11.220 align:start position:0%
straight up the eight there
 
00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:13.560 align:start position:0%
it would be very peculiar for the state
 
00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:15.240 align:start position:0%
to have to have a different definition
 
00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:17.100 align:start position:0%
for Investing For one group over another
 
00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
so well then once again yeah this would
 
00:11:28.069 --> 00:11:28.079 align:start position:0%
apply to both and and the vesting
 
00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:29.880 align:start position:0%
component of it I mean that that's how
 
00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:31.740 align:start position:0%
we've been functioning
 
00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
um it's just never been written in law
 
00:11:34.850 --> 00:11:34.860 align:start position:0%
all of our calculations everything's
 
00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:36.300 align:start position:0%
based off of 10 years for as far as the
 
00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:38.940 align:start position:0%
vesting is concerned the um fact that
 
00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:40.860 align:start position:0%
your average final compensation and
 
00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:43.140 align:start position:0%
earnable compensation definitions so
 
00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:45.420 align:start position:0%
what qualify like what monies you make
 
00:11:47.389 --> 00:11:47.399 align:start position:0%
qualify towards going towards your final
 
00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
benefit and then once we've run the
 
00:11:51.170 --> 00:11:51.180 align:start position:0%
calculation what that average final
 
00:11:53.569 --> 00:11:53.579 align:start position:0%
benefit is going to be where you know we
 
00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:55.320 align:start position:0%
can run the calculations based off of
 
00:11:57.710 --> 00:11:57.720 align:start position:0%
that final amount that you've earned
 
00:11:59.210 --> 00:11:59.220 align:start position:0%
um those things can't be changed after
 
00:12:00.769 --> 00:12:00.779 align:start position:0%
three years they're they're locked in
 
00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
place so if we say we're going to take
 
00:12:05.389 --> 00:12:05.399 align:start position:0%
your best five years all right and you
 
00:12:07.130 --> 00:12:07.140 align:start position:0%
know a few other little caveats in there
 
00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:09.300 align:start position:0%
nuts against too much detail that can't
 
00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
change and once we've calculated what
 
00:12:14.449 --> 00:12:14.459 align:start position:0%
that number is for you that can't change
 
00:12:17.449 --> 00:12:17.459 align:start position:0%
either so those two things but there are
 
00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:19.680 align:start position:0%
many elements that can yes this is just
 
00:12:21.889 --> 00:12:21.899 align:start position:0%
specific to two parts of it right so
 
00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:22.980 align:start position:0%
they can change so right now
 
00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:25.500 align:start position:0%
firefighters pay and 11.8 percent of
 
00:12:27.769 --> 00:12:27.779 align:start position:0%
their own money into the system if a
 
00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:29.160 align:start position:0%
future legislature wanted to come back
 
00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:31.500 align:start position:0%
and say everybody now has to pay in 12
 
00:12:34.069 --> 00:12:34.079 align:start position:0%
or 7 or whatever it would be this
 
00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:35.640 align:start position:0%
wouldn't affect those people in that way
 
00:12:38.389 --> 00:12:38.399 align:start position:0%
we could still change their rates
 
00:12:42.769 --> 00:12:42.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:45.769 --> 00:12:45.779 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so uh one of the
 
00:12:48.050 --> 00:12:48.060 align:start position:0%
things that I think is we should be
 
00:12:50.569 --> 00:12:50.579 align:start position:0%
conscious and cognizant of is that we
 
00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:52.740 align:start position:0%
are creating a record here
 
00:12:55.069 --> 00:12:55.079 align:start position:0%
it's not only the document that we're
 
00:12:57.650 --> 00:12:57.660 align:start position:0%
producing but these deliberations are
 
00:12:59.750 --> 00:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
part of the record okay and that's
 
00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
something that that if it ever came to a
 
00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:05.720 align:start position:0%
suit lawsuit
 
00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:09.180 align:start position:0%
that the court looks back and sees how
 
00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:12.420 align:start position:0%
the how the the record was created and
 
00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:15.000 align:start position:0%
and what the record specified so as long
 
00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:16.680 align:start position:0%
as we're clear about what we're doing
 
00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:19.560 align:start position:0%
and why we're doing it
 
00:13:22.009 --> 00:13:22.019 align:start position:0%
um and and that we are not didn't
 
00:13:24.949 --> 00:13:24.959 align:start position:0%
stumble into it oh you know we'd if we'd
 
00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
ever thought about that we wouldn't have
 
00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
done it that way or we would have done
 
00:13:30.949 --> 00:13:30.959 align:start position:0%
some other way no we are consciously
 
00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
doing this this is what we want to do
 
00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:35.880 align:start position:0%
this we're making this policy decision
 
00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:39.300 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the you know starting the
 
00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:42.600 align:start position:0%
the full committee deliberations uh and
 
00:13:44.930 --> 00:13:44.940 align:start position:0%
as long as we're clear and I am that
 
00:13:47.090 --> 00:13:47.100 align:start position:0%
this is what we want to do we want to
 
00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:48.600 align:start position:0%
lock it in
 
00:13:50.210 --> 00:13:50.220 align:start position:0%
I'm good to go
 
00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:52.500 align:start position:0%
well my feeling on my perspective on it
 
00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:54.769 align:start position:0%
well my feeling on my perspective on it
is

00:13:54.769 --> 00:13:54.779 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:13:56.329 --> 00:13:56.339 align:start position:0%
if we're if we're going to push this
 
00:13:58.550 --> 00:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
legislation forward at all then we said
 
00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:00.720 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't have done it before and if
 
00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:02.040 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't have done it before I'm not
 
00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
sure why we wouldn't limit it from
 
00:14:06.050 --> 00:14:06.060 align:start position:0%
happening again in the future
 
00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:07.860 align:start position:0%
um the two seem to me to go kind of hand
 
00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:09.480 align:start position:0%
in hand
 
00:14:11.329 --> 00:14:11.339 align:start position:0%
um so from that perspective I'm I'm
 
00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:13.500 align:start position:0%
comfortable with it I'm always cognizant
 
00:14:14.930 --> 00:14:14.940 align:start position:0%
of the fact that something catastrophic
 
00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:16.320 align:start position:0%
can happen in the future and this might
 
00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:18.600 align:start position:0%
have a ramification for that
 
00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:19.190 align:start position:0%
have a ramification for that
um

00:14:19.190 --> 00:14:19.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:21.650 --> 00:14:21.660 align:start position:0%
including for the whole system but then
 
00:14:23.629 --> 00:14:23.639 align:start position:0%
again a future legislature can always
 
00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:25.380 align:start position:0%
come out and take this out if they want
 
00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:27.540 align:start position:0%
to so I mean it's repealable it's not
 
00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
constitutional law it's not
 
00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
constitutional law it's statute so it
 
00:14:32.329 --> 00:14:32.339 align:start position:0%
can be repealed
 
00:14:32.339 --> 00:14:34.490 align:start position:0%
can be repealed
um

00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:34.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:36.600 align:start position:0%
so I mean there's always that part of it
 
00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
too in our ever-changing world of of
 
00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:40.850 align:start position:0%
too in our ever-changing world of of
politics

00:14:40.850 --> 00:14:40.860 align:start position:0%
politics
 
00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:41.930 align:start position:0%
politics
um

00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:41.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:43.320 align:start position:0%
so about halfway through our time
 
00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:44.760 align:start position:0%
anybody else have anything else that
 
00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
they would like to interject at this
 
00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:47.210 align:start position:0%
they would like to interject at this
point

00:14:47.210 --> 00:14:47.220 align:start position:0%
point
 
00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
any other concerns questions on the
 
00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:52.670 align:start position:0%
any other concerns questions on the
amendments

00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:52.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:55.490 --> 00:14:55.500 align:start position:0%
are seeing none does anybody have
 
00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
yes okay you know that's fine Chris
 
00:14:59.810 --> 00:14:59.820 align:start position:0%
we've got 15 minutes you can have 10 you
 
00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.430 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:04.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:06.949 --> 00:15:06.959 align:start position:0%
could you review the policy changes
 
00:15:09.290 --> 00:15:09.300 align:start position:0%
policy changes first off you're getting
 
00:15:11.329 --> 00:15:11.339 align:start position:0%
that reduced after three years of
 
00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:14.160 align:start position:0%
service that we just saw okay
 
00:15:20.810 --> 00:15:20.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:23.629 --> 00:15:23.639 align:start position:0%
is it eight was that the one Steve
 
00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:25.800 align:start position:0%
there's definitely one there
 
00:15:27.949 --> 00:15:27.959 align:start position:0%
where's the age yeah the it's the eighth
 
00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:30.300 align:start position:0%
would be yeah there it is the concession
 
00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:32.940 align:start position:0%
of the of the pension cap
 
00:15:35.569 --> 00:15:35.579 align:start position:0%
from 85 to 100 of the members final
 
00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:38.040 align:start position:0%
average compensation there's more than
 
00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
just that though so it's the 85 percent
 
00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:43.860 align:start position:0%
backed back back to 100 but there's also
 
00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
the the fact that the pension cap is now
 
00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
encompassing eight years of people that
 
00:15:53.569 --> 00:15:53.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:55.680 align:start position:0%
so and then it's establishing that
 
00:15:58.129 --> 00:15:58.139 align:start position:0%
pension cap at 125 000 and then it's
 
00:16:00.050 --> 00:16:00.060 align:start position:0%
giving an annual increase of 1.25
 
00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:01.189 align:start position:0%
giving an annual increase of 1.25
percent

00:16:01.189 --> 00:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:16:03.050 --> 00:16:03.060 align:start position:0%
and that just that accounts for
 
00:16:05.449 --> 00:16:05.459 align:start position:0%
inflation so that the um the pension cap
 
00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:07.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't get stagnant
 
00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:09.060 align:start position:0%
uh it doesn't mean that anybody would
 
00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
ever make that amount that's up to
 
00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:12.060 align:start position:0%
municipalities they can they can make
 
00:16:14.689 --> 00:16:14.699 align:start position:0%
that determination
 
00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:16.440 align:start position:0%
um so you're getting that uh you're
 
00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:20.220 align:start position:0%
getting the rollback of the table
 
00:16:22.069 --> 00:16:22.079 align:start position:0%
um so that people who are in that
 
00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:24.600 align:start position:0%
transitional period who had their
 
00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:25.250 align:start position:0%
transitional period who had their
um

00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:25.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:27.240 align:start position:0%
benefits changed the annual multiplier
 
00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:30.060 align:start position:0%
change from 2.4 to 2.3 to 2.2 to 2.1
 
00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:31.980 align:start position:0%
they're every year that's getting
 
00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:33.480 align:start position:0%
repealed for a different group of people
 
00:16:36.829 --> 00:16:36.839 align:start position:0%
back to the 2.5 and the old calculation
 
00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
table that they were hired under so
 
00:16:41.210 --> 00:16:41.220 align:start position:0%
you're getting that I feel like I'm
 
00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:48.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:51.060 align:start position:0%
as far as policy goes yeah
 
00:16:53.090 --> 00:16:53.100 align:start position:0%
no because the rest of it's all the
 
00:16:59.150 --> 00:16:59.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:02.389 --> 00:17:02.399 align:start position:0%
just also too it's not a policy change
 
00:17:07.370 --> 00:17:07.380 align:start position:0%
but it is in essence a concession that
 
00:17:09.409 --> 00:17:09.419 align:start position:0%
the anti-spiking provisions are all
 
00:17:12.590 --> 00:17:12.600 align:start position:0%
remaining sure when those folks prior to
 
00:17:15.049 --> 00:17:15.059 align:start position:0%
09 were not covered
 
00:17:17.210 --> 00:17:17.220 align:start position:0%
with the anti any anti-spiking provision
 
00:17:20.929 --> 00:17:20.939 align:start position:0%
so the 2001 to 2009 folks if we were
 
00:17:23.329 --> 00:17:23.339 align:start position:0%
going to do a full restore back to what
 
00:17:25.370 --> 00:17:25.380 align:start position:0%
they were hired under in theory they
 
00:17:27.890 --> 00:17:27.900 align:start position:0%
should have no pension cap but the
 
00:17:29.810 --> 00:17:29.820 align:start position:0%
pension caps and the anti-spiking
 
00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
provisions are all being left in place
 
00:17:35.090 --> 00:17:35.100 align:start position:0%
to because we don't again as you said we
 
00:17:37.970 --> 00:17:37.980 align:start position:0%
don't want to repeat bad mistakes in
 
00:17:39.770 --> 00:17:39.780 align:start position:0%
both directions here
 
00:17:42.049 --> 00:17:42.059 align:start position:0%
so as far as I can see we have two
 
00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:44.460 align:start position:0%
options before us as a subcommittee
 
00:17:46.669 --> 00:17:46.679 align:start position:0%
um we can either
 
00:17:49.010 --> 00:17:49.020 align:start position:0%
recommend the adoption of this amendment
 
00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:50.580 align:start position:0%
for the executive session this afternoon
 
00:17:52.250 --> 00:17:52.260 align:start position:0%
because we are executing this bill one
 
00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
way or another at one o'clock this
 
00:17:56.210 --> 00:17:56.220 align:start position:0%
afternoon it's scheduled for that so we
 
00:17:57.710 --> 00:17:57.720 align:start position:0%
can either bring this recommendation
 
00:17:59.690 --> 00:17:59.700 align:start position:0%
forward or the bill in its original form
 
00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:01.080 align:start position:0%
will come forward to the executive
 
00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:03.000 align:start position:0%
committee and we'll be debating that
 
00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:06.120 align:start position:0%
original bill without this amendment
 
00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:07.070 align:start position:0%
original bill without this amendment
um

00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:08.830 --> 00:18:08.840 align:start position:0%
does anybody see that differently Tony
 
00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:11.700 align:start position:0%
son all right
 
00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:13.980 align:start position:0%
yeah I understand I'm not I don't have a
 
00:18:15.289 --> 00:18:15.299 align:start position:0%
vote but yeah no no I was just looking
 
00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:16.860 align:start position:0%
for you for clarification also
 
00:18:19.130 --> 00:18:19.140 align:start position:0%
procedurally the only way you would not
 
00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
debate the original bill is that if
 
00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:24.660 align:start position:0%
someone on the committee immediately
 
00:18:27.169 --> 00:18:27.179 align:start position:0%
moves this the amendment and then you
 
00:18:28.549 --> 00:18:28.559 align:start position:0%
don't have to have two discussions
 
00:18:33.250 --> 00:18:33.260 align:start position:0%
exactly right so if if the
 
00:18:35.450 --> 00:18:35.460 align:start position:0%
subcommittee thinks that we should move
 
00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:36.840 align:start position:0%
this amendment
 
00:18:38.690 --> 00:18:38.700 align:start position:0%
um I will be moving that Amendment at
 
00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:42.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:45.440 align:start position:0%
that's pretty standard procedure that
 
00:18:49.850 --> 00:18:49.860 align:start position:0%
subcommittee chair makes the motion okay
 
00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:51.480 align:start position:0%
does anybody have any concern with
 
00:18:54.049 --> 00:18:54.059 align:start position:0%
moving this amendment Chris yeah yeah no
 
00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:56.640 align:start position:0%
you had your hand up before yeah I'm
 
00:18:58.549 --> 00:18:58.559 align:start position:0%
down to four thousand
 
00:18:58.559 --> 00:18:59.750 align:start position:0%
down to four thousand
um

00:18:59.750 --> 00:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:01.730 --> 00:19:01.740 align:start position:0%
is there going to be on the original
 
00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:03.169 align:start position:0%
is there going to be on the original
bill

00:19:03.169 --> 00:19:03.179 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:19:06.289 --> 00:19:06.299 align:start position:0%
it was uh downshifting to the uh to the
 
00:19:08.090 --> 00:19:08.100 align:start position:0%
political subdivisions yeah so there
 
00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:10.020 align:start position:0%
isn't on this one this comes out of the
 
00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:10.850 align:start position:0%
isn't on this one this comes out of the
state

00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:10.860 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:14.160 align:start position:0%
right we pay for it and and that is do
 
00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:16.740 align:start position:0%
we get a physical note on that not yet
 
00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:18.600 align:start position:0%
so this is where we sit as far as the
 
00:19:21.049 --> 00:19:21.059 align:start position:0%
fiscal component of this concerned this
 
00:19:21.059 --> 00:19:22.190 align:start position:0%
fiscal component of this concerned this
amendment

00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:22.200 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
um yeah has to pass and it would
 
00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:28.440 align:start position:0%
allocate 25 million dollars okay if that
 
00:19:31.909 --> 00:19:31.919 align:start position:0%
stands if nobody changes that
 
00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:34.500 align:start position:0%
um any of the 25 million dollars that
 
00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:37.020 align:start position:0%
isn't spent to meet the requirements of
 
00:19:39.770 --> 00:19:39.780 align:start position:0%
the bill would be downshifted to
 
00:19:41.450 --> 00:19:41.460 align:start position:0%
municipalities to lower their rates
 
00:19:43.610 --> 00:19:43.620 align:start position:0%
however this bill still will have to go
 
00:19:45.770 --> 00:19:45.780 align:start position:0%
to finance and finance will have a
 
00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:47.150 align:start position:0%
to finance and finance will have a
finalized

00:19:47.150 --> 00:19:47.160 align:start position:0%
finalized
 
00:19:49.490 --> 00:19:49.500 align:start position:0%
um fiscal note and they can make an
 
00:19:51.049 --> 00:19:51.059 align:start position:0%
adjustment to it if they choose so if
 
00:19:52.669 --> 00:19:52.679 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note comes in at let's say
 
00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
just for for ease 200 million dollars
 
00:19:57.770 --> 00:19:57.780 align:start position:0%
they can down they can amend the bill to
 
00:19:59.870 --> 00:19:59.880 align:start position:0%
say 20 million dollars over the next 10
 
00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:01.260 align:start position:0%
years and then that's what we would pay
 
00:20:02.570 --> 00:20:02.580 align:start position:0%
in there'd be less obviously
 
00:20:04.490 --> 00:20:04.500 align:start position:0%
downshifting to the municipalities for
 
00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:06.360 align:start position:0%
rate reduction at that point but that's
 
00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:08.340 align:start position:0%
something that that Finance can do if
 
00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:10.260 align:start position:0%
they choose to
 
00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:12.240 align:start position:0%
does that make sense
 
00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
anybody else
 
00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:17.280 align:start position:0%
also representative true understand that
 
00:20:19.669 --> 00:20:19.679 align:start position:0%
it's a policy problem that we have with
 
00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:21.720 align:start position:0%
the rules of the retirement system it's
 
00:20:24.049 --> 00:20:24.059 align:start position:0%
not that they are unwilling to give a
 
00:20:25.909 --> 00:20:25.919 align:start position:0%
fiscal note for this right now they are
 
00:20:28.549 --> 00:20:28.559 align:start position:0%
prevented until this passes yeah we've
 
00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:29.700 align:start position:0%
got to get this out of our committee
 
00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:31.080 align:start position:0%
well through this committee or through
 
00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:33.360 align:start position:0%
the house there's been some discussion
 
00:20:35.450 --> 00:20:35.460 align:start position:0%
as to
 
00:20:37.970 --> 00:20:37.980 align:start position:0%
um internally talking to Marty about
 
00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:39.110 align:start position:0%
um internally talking to Marty about
that

00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:40.860 align:start position:0%
they're going to try to see if they can
 
00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:43.080 align:start position:0%
loophole around this once the committee
 
00:20:45.409 --> 00:20:45.419 align:start position:0%
passes it to start that process but
 
00:20:48.350 --> 00:20:48.360 align:start position:0%
technically it has to pass the house so
 
00:20:51.409 --> 00:20:51.419 align:start position:0%
it's it's a week but even still Finance
 
00:20:53.570 --> 00:20:53.580 align:start position:0%
should have it be able to hang on to it
 
00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
for long enough to get the fiscal note
 
00:20:56.930 --> 00:20:56.940 align:start position:0%
and then they can be good decision but
 
00:20:59.450 --> 00:20:59.460 align:start position:0%
either way whatever anyone does it's
 
00:21:01.370 --> 00:21:01.380 align:start position:0%
terminally funded it's terminally funded
 
00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:05.750 align:start position:0%
terminally funded it's terminally funded
yes

00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
would anybody like to make a motion as
 
00:21:09.890 --> 00:21:09.900 align:start position:0%
to whether or not to adopt this
 
00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:13.130 align:start position:0%
to whether or not to adopt this
amendment

00:21:13.130 --> 00:21:13.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:15.240 align:start position:0%
Representatives I'll make a motion of
 
00:21:17.450 --> 00:21:17.460 align:start position:0%
ought to pass okay do you have a second
 
00:21:19.549 --> 00:21:19.559 align:start position:0%
on that representative Gerhard thank you
 
00:21:22.789 --> 00:21:22.799 align:start position:0%
you guys want to say anything about it
 
00:21:24.289 --> 00:21:24.299 align:start position:0%
I think it's all pretty much been
 
00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
covered so but like I said I'm very
 
00:21:28.669 --> 00:21:28.679 align:start position:0%
impressed with this and finally happy to
 
00:21:29.870 --> 00:21:29.880 align:start position:0%
see something that comes through that
 
00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:31.500 align:start position:0%
really helps people in the retirement
 
00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:32.570 align:start position:0%
really helps people in the retirement
system

00:21:32.570 --> 00:21:32.580 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:34.090 align:start position:0%
system
yeah

00:21:34.090 --> 00:21:34.100 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:37.200 align:start position:0%
hopefully it reestablishes the state's
 
00:21:39.409 --> 00:21:39.419 align:start position:0%
credibility awesome
 
00:21:41.029 --> 00:21:41.039 align:start position:0%

um
 
00:21:44.390 --> 00:21:44.400 align:start position:0%
I think it is it is definitely an
 
00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:45.350 align:start position:0%
I think it is it is definitely an
improvement

00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:45.360 align:start position:0%
improvement
 
00:21:48.409 --> 00:21:48.419 align:start position:0%
over downshifting 10 million dollars to
 
00:21:49.669 --> 00:21:49.679 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:21:53.570 --> 00:21:53.580 align:start position:0%

00:22:00.299 --> 00:22:01.669 align:start position:0%
but I support the amendment as being an
improvement

00:22:01.669 --> 00:22:01.679 align:start position:0%

00:30:42.649 --> 00:30:42.659 align:start position:0%
um I Rise to support HB 457 which is an
 
00:30:44.630 --> 00:30:44.640 align:start position:0%
act relative to the State Treasury and
 
00:30:47.330 --> 00:30:47.340 align:start position:0%
pension fund management the key sentence
 
00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:49.440 align:start position:0%
in the bill and it applies to both
 
00:30:52.010 --> 00:30:52.020 align:start position:0%
treasury funds and Pension funds is all
 
00:30:53.930 --> 00:30:53.940 align:start position:0%
Investments and their management shall
 
00:30:56.389 --> 00:30:56.399 align:start position:0%
be governed by the fiduciary duty to
 
00:30:58.669 --> 00:30:58.679 align:start position:0%
maximize benefits for the state or the
 
00:31:01.730 --> 00:31:01.740 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries of the state's trust funds
 
00:31:03.529 --> 00:31:03.539 align:start position:0%
it's a very simple
 
00:31:06.409 --> 00:31:06.419 align:start position:0%
clear responsibility
 
00:31:10.730 --> 00:31:10.740 align:start position:0%
but why present the bill why why isn't
 
00:31:13.789 --> 00:31:13.799 align:start position:0%
this already being done
 
00:31:16.970 --> 00:31:16.980 align:start position:0%
well the federal government is changing
 
00:31:19.310 --> 00:31:19.320 align:start position:0%
the rules on fund management and the
 
00:31:21.529 --> 00:31:21.539 align:start position:0%
very latest set of rules that they've
 
00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
modified are the erisa rules the
 
00:31:26.470 --> 00:31:26.480 align:start position:0%
employee retirement income Security Act
 
00:31:29.990 --> 00:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh basically they have now said that
 
00:31:33.409 --> 00:31:33.419 align:start position:0%
plans can consider ESG in pension fund
 
00:31:33.419 --> 00:31:34.970 align:start position:0%
plans can consider ESG in pension fund
Investments

00:31:34.970 --> 00:31:34.980 align:start position:0%
Investments
 
00:31:37.070 --> 00:31:37.080 align:start position:0%
why is this a problem
 
00:31:39.110 --> 00:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
why did they need to do this well
 
00:31:42.529 --> 00:31:42.539 align:start position:0%
because ESG funds traditionally do not
 
00:31:45.529 --> 00:31:45.539 align:start position:0%
carry the same return as traditional
 
00:31:47.870 --> 00:31:47.880 align:start position:0%
funds that's why they have to change the
 
00:31:52.010 --> 00:31:52.020 align:start position:0%
rules we're not maximizing return for
 
00:31:54.889 --> 00:31:54.899 align:start position:0%
every dollar invested our pensioners are
 
00:31:57.889 --> 00:31:57.899 align:start position:0%
not getting the full value of their
 
00:31:57.899 --> 00:32:00.169 align:start position:0%
not getting the full value of their
pension

00:32:00.169 --> 00:32:00.179 align:start position:0%
pension
 
00:32:03.610 --> 00:32:03.620 align:start position:0%
the CEO of BlackRock is the largest
 
00:32:07.070 --> 00:32:07.080 align:start position:0%
investment firm managing these kinds of
 
00:32:10.130 --> 00:32:10.140 align:start position:0%
funds says it's okay to have pension
 
00:32:13.370 --> 00:32:13.380 align:start position:0%
okay to have your have lower returns for
 
00:32:16.310 --> 00:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
about 10 years while we achieve broader
 
00:32:18.889 --> 00:32:18.899 align:start position:0%
sustainability objectives
 
00:32:22.130 --> 00:32:22.140 align:start position:0%
now we are not alone in this there are
 
00:32:24.010 --> 00:32:24.020 align:start position:0%
six other states that have already
 
00:32:26.870 --> 00:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
adopted similar measures West Virginia
 
00:32:29.830 --> 00:32:29.840 align:start position:0%
Florida Texas Utah Kentucky and Oklahoma
 
00:32:32.210 --> 00:32:32.220 align:start position:0%
they've either done done this by
 
00:32:35.870 --> 00:32:35.880 align:start position:0%
legislation or by their treasure taking
 
00:32:39.649 --> 00:32:39.659 align:start position:0%
action to specify compliance with these
 
00:32:39.659 --> 00:32:40.970 align:start position:0%
action to specify compliance with these
standards

00:32:40.970 --> 00:32:40.980 align:start position:0%
standards
 
00:32:43.909 --> 00:32:43.919 align:start position:0%
I like to read a note from the Kentucky
 
00:32:47.330 --> 00:32:47.340 align:start position:0%
attorney general about this issue
 
00:32:50.330 --> 00:32:50.340 align:start position:0%
while asset managers May review a social
 
00:32:53.690 --> 00:32:53.700 align:start position:0%
purpose or sacrifice some performance on
 
00:32:56.710 --> 00:32:56.720 align:start position:0%
their Investments to achieve an ESG goal
 
00:32:59.690 --> 00:32:59.700 align:start position:0%
investment managers entrusted to make
 
00:33:02.529 --> 00:33:02.539 align:start position:0%
financial investments for public pension
 
00:33:06.230 --> 00:33:06.240 align:start position:0%
systems must
 
00:33:09.049 --> 00:33:09.059 align:start position:0%
be single-minded in their motivation and
 
00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
actions and their decisions must be
 
00:33:13.730 --> 00:33:13.740 align:start position:0%
solely in the interest of the members of
 
00:33:15.590 --> 00:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
the benefit members and beneficiaries
 
00:33:17.450 --> 00:33:17.460 align:start position:0%
and for the exclusive purpose of
 
00:33:19.250 --> 00:33:19.260 align:start position:0%
providing benefits to the members and
 
00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:20.810 align:start position:0%
providing benefits to the members and
beneficiaries

00:33:20.810 --> 00:33:20.820 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries
 
00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
to do otherwise risks breaching clearly
 
00:33:26.450 --> 00:33:26.460 align:start position:0%
established statutory contractual
 
00:33:29.029 --> 00:33:29.039 align:start position:0%
fiduciary duties
 
00:33:31.070 --> 00:33:31.080 align:start position:0%
it is the opinion of this office that
 
00:33:33.889 --> 00:33:33.899 align:start position:0%
stakeholder capitalism and environmental
 
00:33:36.110 --> 00:33:36.120 align:start position:0%
social governments investment practices
 
00:33:39.049 --> 00:33:39.059 align:start position:0%
then introduce mixed motivations to
 
00:33:41.509 --> 00:33:41.519 align:start position:0%
investment decisions are inconsistent
 
00:33:43.970 --> 00:33:43.980 align:start position:0%
with the law governing fiduciary duties
 
00:33:45.669 --> 00:33:45.679 align:start position:0%
and by
 
00:33:49.130 --> 00:33:49.140 align:start position:0%
owned by Investment Management firms to
 
00:33:53.149 --> 00:33:53.159 align:start position:0%
public benefit public pension plans
 
00:33:55.610 --> 00:33:55.620 align:start position:0%
in addition to that there are 16 other
 
00:33:58.370 --> 00:33:58.380 align:start position:0%
states that are taking up similar
 
00:33:58.380 --> 00:34:00.590 align:start position:0%
states that are taking up similar
legislation

00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:00.600 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:34:03.289 --> 00:34:03.299 align:start position:0%
um and several of the attorney generals
 
00:34:07.070 --> 00:34:07.080 align:start position:0%
have also written a letter to the CEO of
 
00:34:09.230 --> 00:34:09.240 align:start position:0%
BlackRock I mentioned the largest of one
 
00:34:11.930 --> 00:34:11.940 align:start position:0%
of these Investment Management firms and
 
00:34:14.629 --> 00:34:14.639 align:start position:0%
one one or two sentences here in that
 
00:34:16.909 --> 00:34:16.919 align:start position:0%
letter based on the facts currently
 
00:34:19.490 --> 00:34:19.500 align:start position:0%
available to us BlackRock appears to use
 
00:34:21.950 --> 00:34:21.960 align:start position:0%
hard-earned money of our city state
 
00:34:25.070 --> 00:34:25.080 align:start position:0%
citizens to circumvent the best possible
 
00:34:28.369 --> 00:34:28.379 align:start position:0%
return on investment as well as their
 
00:34:31.250 --> 00:34:31.260 align:start position:0%
vote blackrock's public past public
 
00:34:33.649 --> 00:34:33.659 align:start position:0%
commitments indicate that it has used
 
00:34:36.770 --> 00:34:36.780 align:start position:0%
citizens assets to pressure companies to
 
00:34:38.869 --> 00:34:38.879 align:start position:0%
comply with International agreements
 
00:34:41.690 --> 00:34:41.700 align:start position:0%
that Force the phase out of fossil fuels
 
00:34:44.329 --> 00:34:44.339 align:start position:0%
increase energy prices Drive inflation
 
00:34:46.250 --> 00:34:46.260 align:start position:0%
and weaken National Security of the
 
00:34:47.990 --> 00:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
United States
 
00:34:52.210 --> 00:34:52.220 align:start position:0%
as I indicated this was signed by 19
 
00:34:56.510 --> 00:34:56.520 align:start position:0%
attorneys generals of different states
 
00:35:01.490 --> 00:35:01.500 align:start position:0%
so how is this done well basically the
 
00:35:04.150 --> 00:35:04.160 align:start position:0%
largest Investment Management firms
 
00:35:07.609 --> 00:35:07.619 align:start position:0%
BlackRock Vanguard State Street they
 
00:35:09.950 --> 00:35:09.960 align:start position:0%
have about three quarters the asset size
 
00:35:13.490 --> 00:35:13.500 align:start position:0%
of the U.S gross domestic product
 
00:35:16.010 --> 00:35:16.020 align:start position:0%
they have the largest they're the
 
00:35:19.450 --> 00:35:19.460 align:start position:0%
largest shareholders and 90 of the s p
 
00:35:22.790 --> 00:35:22.800 align:start position:0%
uh 500 companies
 
00:35:26.510 --> 00:35:26.520 align:start position:0%
and they force Behavior by voting their
 
00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:27.770 align:start position:0%
and they force Behavior by voting their
shares

00:35:27.770 --> 00:35:27.780 align:start position:0%
shares
 
00:35:30.890 --> 00:35:30.900 align:start position:0%
our shares our pensioners shares
 
00:35:33.950 --> 00:35:33.960 align:start position:0%
they vote them to force the activity
 
00:35:35.810 --> 00:35:35.820 align:start position:0%
that they want
 
00:35:39.170 --> 00:35:39.180 align:start position:0%
to have happen I'll give you an example
 
00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:41.329 align:start position:0%
to have happen I'll give you an example
Exxon

00:35:41.329 --> 00:35:41.339 align:start position:0%
Exxon
 
00:35:43.730 --> 00:35:43.740 align:start position:0%
it had three board members up for
 
00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:45.770 align:start position:0%
it had three board members up for
renewal

00:35:45.770 --> 00:35:45.780 align:start position:0%
renewal
 
00:35:48.650 --> 00:35:48.660 align:start position:0%
the triumviron of BlackRock being a
 
00:35:51.970 --> 00:35:51.980 align:start position:0%
Garden State feat voted in three in
 
00:35:53.810 --> 00:35:53.820 align:start position:0%
environmentalists to sit on that board
 
00:35:56.150 --> 00:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
instead of oil and gas people
 
00:35:59.270 --> 00:35:59.280 align:start position:0%
that caused black rock or that caused
 
00:36:02.030 --> 00:36:02.040 align:start position:0%
Exxon to abandon its leasing
 
00:36:04.970 --> 00:36:04.980 align:start position:0%
opportunities in Vietnam and Malaysia
 
00:36:08.030 --> 00:36:08.040 align:start position:0%
who bought them the Chinese Communist
 
00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:09.710 align:start position:0%
who bought them the Chinese Communist
parties

00:36:09.710 --> 00:36:09.720 align:start position:0%
parties
 
00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:11.210 align:start position:0%
parties
uh

00:36:11.210 --> 00:36:11.220 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:36:14.829 --> 00:36:14.839 align:start position:0%
energy firm and who is the largest
 
00:36:18.829 --> 00:36:18.839 align:start position:0%
shareholder in that company in in the
 
00:36:22.790 --> 00:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
Chinese firm happens to be BlackRock so
 
00:36:28.010 --> 00:36:28.020 align:start position:0%
we lose China wins BlackRock wins and
 
00:36:30.589 --> 00:36:30.599 align:start position:0%
Americans are seeing a Devastation of
 
00:36:34.490 --> 00:36:34.500 align:start position:0%
our energy investment structure about 90
 
00:36:37.430 --> 00:36:37.440 align:start position:0%
percent of oil and gas investment has
 
00:36:41.329 --> 00:36:41.339 align:start position:0%
has been uh dried up in the last few
 
00:36:44.510 --> 00:36:44.520 align:start position:0%
years our costs go up natural gas costs
 
00:36:46.670 --> 00:36:46.680 align:start position:0%
go up gas costs go up at the
 
00:36:48.430 --> 00:36:48.440 align:start position:0%
at the pump
 
00:36:51.470 --> 00:36:51.480 align:start position:0%
and we see it in our electric rates and
 
00:36:53.810 --> 00:36:53.820 align:start position:0%
our fuel oil costs and our gas to heat
 
00:36:56.230 --> 00:36:56.240 align:start position:0%
our home
 
00:37:00.470 --> 00:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
so their goal is to force Behavior
 
00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:01.510 align:start position:0%
so their goal is to force Behavior
change

00:37:01.510 --> 00:37:01.520 align:start position:0%
change
 
00:37:06.050 --> 00:37:06.060 align:start position:0%
I submit to you that it is your job as
 
00:37:09.109 --> 00:37:09.119 align:start position:0%
federal and state legislators to decide
 
00:37:12.650 --> 00:37:12.660 align:start position:0%
what policies we're to have not these
 
00:37:15.770 --> 00:37:15.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:18.240 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is we have higher energy
 
00:37:21.530 --> 00:37:21.540 align:start position:0%
costs and lower rates of Returns on our
 
00:37:23.930 --> 00:37:23.940 align:start position:0%
Pension funds and a loss of legislative
 
00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:26.810 align:start position:0%
Pension funds and a loss of legislative
Authority

00:37:26.810 --> 00:37:26.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:29.630 --> 00:37:29.640 align:start position:0%
so the fix is simple
 
00:37:32.450 --> 00:37:32.460 align:start position:0%
the short one sentence change to both
 
00:37:36.050 --> 00:37:36.060 align:start position:0%
the treasurer and the pension fund
 
00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:37.910 align:start position:0%
the treasurer and the pension fund
responsibilities

00:37:37.910 --> 00:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
responsibilities
 
00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:38.569 align:start position:0%
responsibilities
um

00:37:38.569 --> 00:37:38.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:41.870 --> 00:37:41.880 align:start position:0%
I might comment on what I saw in the
 
00:37:44.770 --> 00:37:44.780 align:start position:0%
fiscal note regarding this
 
00:37:47.750 --> 00:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
there was some concern that that
 
00:37:50.990 --> 00:37:51.000 align:start position:0%
adopting uh fiduciary duty
 
00:37:53.030 --> 00:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
responsibility rather than a sole
 
00:37:55.430 --> 00:37:55.440 align:start position:0%
interest standard may be antithetical to
 
00:37:57.890 --> 00:37:57.900 align:start position:0%
the the pension fund's responsibilities
 
00:38:00.650 --> 00:38:00.660 align:start position:0%
I submit they are essentially the same
 
00:38:02.930 --> 00:38:02.940 align:start position:0%
if anything the sole interest standard
 
00:38:04.990 --> 00:38:05.000 align:start position:0%
may be a little higher
 
00:38:08.329 --> 00:38:08.339 align:start position:0%
but I would ask anyone testifying from
 
00:38:13.010 --> 00:38:13.020 align:start position:0%
that side of the uh of the house do they
 
00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:15.720 align:start position:0%
have any funds invested in being managed
 
00:38:17.870 --> 00:38:17.880 align:start position:0%
by BlackRock State Street or Vanguard
 
00:38:20.510 --> 00:38:20.520 align:start position:0%
are they using ESG in their funds and
 
00:38:23.390 --> 00:38:23.400 align:start position:0%
are they operating to the detriment of
 
00:38:24.950 --> 00:38:24.960 align:start position:0%
our pensioners
 
00:38:27.470 --> 00:38:27.480 align:start position:0%
with that I'll stop and answer any
 
00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:31.190 align:start position:0%
with that I'll stop and answer any
questions

00:38:31.190 --> 00:38:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:32.390 --> 00:38:32.400 align:start position:0%
thank you are there questions
 
00:38:35.450 --> 00:38:35.460 align:start position:0%
representative thank you you uh
 
00:38:38.930 --> 00:38:38.940 align:start position:0%
mentioned the uh changes to the Federal
 
00:38:42.109 --> 00:38:42.119 align:start position:0%
uh fiduciary duty for people that invest
 
00:38:44.450 --> 00:38:44.460 align:start position:0%
in Pension funds I'd heard about that I
 
00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
thought they were proposed what is do
 
00:38:49.069 --> 00:38:49.079 align:start position:0%
you know the status of them in November
 
00:38:52.010 --> 00:38:52.020 align:start position:0%
that was adopted that said you can now
 
00:38:56.150 --> 00:38:56.160 align:start position:0%
do it it was a proposal in November of
 
00:39:00.410 --> 00:39:00.420 align:start position:0%
of last year they it's you may now use
 
00:39:03.710 --> 00:39:03.720 align:start position:0%
ESG criteria in managing your funds so
 
00:39:05.810 --> 00:39:05.820 align:start position:0%
instead of having a strict fiduciary
 
00:39:10.030 --> 00:39:10.040 align:start position:0%
duty now you can intermix your these
 
00:39:14.990 --> 00:39:15.000 align:start position:0%
additional Concepts okay thank you
 
00:39:17.210 --> 00:39:17.220 align:start position:0%
Simon thank you madam chair thank you
 
00:39:18.829 --> 00:39:18.839 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
00:39:20.630 --> 00:39:20.640 align:start position:0%
um outside of the three main Brokers
 
00:39:22.130 --> 00:39:22.140 align:start position:0%
that you're talking about
 
00:39:24.710 --> 00:39:24.720 align:start position:0%
how would we determine whether or not
 
00:39:28.010 --> 00:39:28.020 align:start position:0%
somebody was using ESG for example over
 
00:39:29.690 --> 00:39:29.700 align:start position:0%
just straight up fiduciary
 
00:39:31.970 --> 00:39:31.980 align:start position:0%
responsibility and what are the
 
00:39:35.270 --> 00:39:35.280 align:start position:0%
repercussions if they don't follow these
 
00:39:36.770 --> 00:39:36.780 align:start position:0%
guidelines if they do for example use
 
00:39:39.190 --> 00:39:39.200 align:start position:0%
the SG
 
00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:40.849 align:start position:0%
the SG
uh

00:39:40.849 --> 00:39:40.859 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:39:43.370 --> 00:39:43.380 align:start position:0%
I am not sure how we deal with the
 
00:39:48.470 --> 00:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
repercussions but the folks managing the
 
00:39:53.390 --> 00:39:53.400 align:start position:0%
funds need to be asking the questions of
 
00:39:56.930 --> 00:39:56.940 align:start position:0%
of the funds that they're reviewing to
 
00:39:59.690 --> 00:39:59.700 align:start position:0%
at you know to invest in they have to
 
00:40:01.550 --> 00:40:01.560 align:start position:0%
specifically ask those kinds of
 
00:40:05.690 --> 00:40:05.700 align:start position:0%
questions are you using ESG criteria in
 
00:40:07.910 --> 00:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
making decisions in managing this fund
 
00:40:10.849 --> 00:40:10.859 align:start position:0%
are you using uh
 
00:40:14.569 --> 00:40:14.579 align:start position:0%
um diversity Equity inclusion criteria
 
00:40:16.730 --> 00:40:16.740 align:start position:0%
in managing These funds are you using
 
00:40:19.730 --> 00:40:19.740 align:start position:0%
anything other than strict Financial
 
00:40:23.630 --> 00:40:23.640 align:start position:0%
fiduciary duty pecuniary interest
 
00:40:26.870 --> 00:40:26.880 align:start position:0%
thank you it's an act of responsibility
 
00:40:28.849 --> 00:40:28.859 align:start position:0%
on these on the part of these folks
 
00:40:32.870 --> 00:40:32.880 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:40:34.730 --> 00:40:34.740 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for being here
 
00:40:36.530 --> 00:40:36.540 align:start position:0%
today I think that this is a true
 
00:40:38.569 --> 00:40:38.579 align:start position:0%
concern and something I'm very
 
00:40:40.130 --> 00:40:40.140 align:start position:0%
interested in
 
00:40:43.550 --> 00:40:43.560 align:start position:0%
um spinning off of our co-chairs
 
00:40:47.690 --> 00:40:47.700 align:start position:0%
question when we because I've been
 
00:40:49.310 --> 00:40:49.320 align:start position:0%
through this personally myself when
 
00:40:51.650 --> 00:40:51.660 align:start position:0%
you're asking those questions how how
 
00:40:55.550 --> 00:40:55.560 align:start position:0%
could this lock in to ensure that it's
 
00:40:58.790 --> 00:40:58.800 align:start position:0%
in writing that they're not using ESG
 
00:41:02.810 --> 00:41:02.820 align:start position:0%
because even as I've been diving in to
 
00:41:05.630 --> 00:41:05.640 align:start position:0%
some of my business dealings and asking
 
00:41:08.210 --> 00:41:08.220 align:start position:0%
I'll get a very delayed answer of 48
 
00:41:11.630 --> 00:41:11.640 align:start position:0%
hours and then they come back and say no
 
00:41:13.970 --> 00:41:13.980 align:start position:0%
but I'm not getting a very confident no
 
00:41:16.310 --> 00:41:16.320 align:start position:0%
we're not using ESG
 
00:41:19.790 --> 00:41:19.800 align:start position:0%
so how can we strengthen this or ensure
 
00:41:21.950 --> 00:41:21.960 align:start position:0%
I like where you're going with it I'm
 
00:41:23.990 --> 00:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
just I want to make sure that it's it's
 
00:41:25.670 --> 00:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
solid thank you
 
00:41:27.770 --> 00:41:27.780 align:start position:0%
well it's my understanding that any of
 
00:41:30.050 --> 00:41:30.060 align:start position:0%
these funds there has to be a full
 
00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:32.640 align:start position:0%
disclosure of the risks and the benefits
 
00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:38.640 align:start position:0%
and and normally on page 90 of that in
 
00:41:40.970 --> 00:41:40.980 align:start position:0%
this in the fine print they'll say oh
 
00:41:44.750 --> 00:41:44.760 align:start position:0%
well we we do use some of our monies for
 
00:41:47.750 --> 00:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
ESG purposes but no maybe not all of it
 
00:41:51.109 --> 00:41:51.119 align:start position:0%
you know so they have to disclose they
 
00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
have a requirement to disclose and and
 
00:41:57.829 --> 00:41:57.839 align:start position:0%
so it does require someone to be active
 
00:42:00.770 --> 00:42:00.780 align:start position:0%
as you as you mentioned you have to ask
 
00:42:04.490 --> 00:42:04.500 align:start position:0%
these questions you can't just say you
 
00:42:06.650 --> 00:42:06.660 align:start position:0%
know I trust you you're you're a good
 
00:42:10.490 --> 00:42:10.500 align:start position:0%
Financial uh firm and you've got a good
 
00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
track record with us and so you know we
 
00:42:15.829 --> 00:42:15.839 align:start position:0%
accept your your uh
 
00:42:15.839 --> 00:42:17.750 align:start position:0%
accept your your uh
proposals

00:42:17.750 --> 00:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
proposals
 
00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:18.770 align:start position:0%
proposals
okay

00:42:18.770 --> 00:42:18.780 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:42:20.569 --> 00:42:20.579 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I forgot to thank
 
00:42:21.970 --> 00:42:21.980 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:42:24.650 --> 00:42:24.660 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:42:26.569 --> 00:42:26.579 align:start position:0%
I think this is a really good idea but
 
00:42:27.650 --> 00:42:27.660 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering if we're going about
 
00:42:31.010 --> 00:42:31.020 align:start position:0%
it the wrong way in a sense so article
 
00:42:33.349 --> 00:42:33.359 align:start position:0%
83 allows the general court to
 
00:42:34.609 --> 00:42:34.619 align:start position:0%
investigate any corporations for
 
00:42:34.619 --> 00:42:35.990 align:start position:0%
investigate any corporations for
Monopoly

00:42:35.990 --> 00:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
Monopoly
 
00:42:38.630 --> 00:42:38.640 align:start position:0%
a fraud I mean therefore all just
 
00:42:40.069 --> 00:42:40.079 align:start position:0%
powered by the state is hereby Grant to
 
00:42:41.270 --> 00:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
the general court to enact laws to
 
00:42:42.410 --> 00:42:42.420 align:start position:0%
prevent the operations within the state
 
00:42:44.030 --> 00:42:44.040 align:start position:0%
of all persons and associations and all
 
00:42:46.069 --> 00:42:46.079 align:start position:0%
trusts and Corporation corporations
 
00:42:47.750 --> 00:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
foreign or domestic and the officers
 
00:42:49.490 --> 00:42:49.500 align:start position:0%
thereof who may Endeavor to raise the
 
00:42:51.349 --> 00:42:51.359 align:start position:0%
price of any article Commerce Etc et
 
00:42:52.730 --> 00:42:52.740 align:start position:0%
cetera I think we've pretty much
 
00:42:54.170 --> 00:42:54.180 align:start position:0%
established that BlackRock has a
 
00:42:56.630 --> 00:42:56.640 align:start position:0%
monopoly position in many ways I'm just
 
00:42:58.790 --> 00:42:58.800 align:start position:0%
concerned and maybe
 
00:43:01.309 --> 00:43:01.319 align:start position:0%
going another route because I just worry
 
00:43:03.410 --> 00:43:03.420 align:start position:0%
about as we say earlier trying to figure
 
00:43:05.569 --> 00:43:05.579 align:start position:0%
out they really are engaging in this
 
00:43:06.770 --> 00:43:06.780 align:start position:0%
kind of activity
 
00:43:10.190 --> 00:43:10.200 align:start position:0%
so that's my concern well it's
 
00:43:12.349 --> 00:43:12.359 align:start position:0%
it's clear that they are whether they
 
00:43:16.130 --> 00:43:16.140 align:start position:0%
have a monopoly activity or not I I it
 
00:43:21.109 --> 00:43:21.119 align:start position:0%
in aggregate they have have joined with
 
00:43:24.349 --> 00:43:24.359 align:start position:0%
other investment firms and they
 
00:43:28.490 --> 00:43:28.500 align:start position:0%
they have uh maybe a little less of half
 
00:43:31.910 --> 00:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
of all the investment money in the world
 
00:43:34.670 --> 00:43:34.680 align:start position:0%
um all these firms together they're part
 
00:43:39.349 --> 00:43:39.359 align:start position:0%
of the the Global Financial Alliance uh
 
00:43:43.670 --> 00:43:43.680 align:start position:0%
for Net Zero uh and climate 100 group
 
00:43:46.450 --> 00:43:46.460 align:start position:0%
and and so in aggregate they have that
 
00:43:49.910 --> 00:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
tremendous marketing power or tremendous
 
00:43:52.190 --> 00:43:52.200 align:start position:0%
voting power when you when you sit on a
 
00:43:56.690 --> 00:43:56.700 align:start position:0%
board and and and and you have so the
 
00:43:58.970 --> 00:43:58.980 align:start position:0%
larger share you're the you collectively
 
00:44:01.190 --> 00:44:01.200 align:start position:0%
are the largest shareholder you can you
 
00:44:03.290 --> 00:44:03.300 align:start position:0%
can cause a company to do whatever you
 
00:44:06.290 --> 00:44:06.300 align:start position:0%
want it to do that's the concern and
 
00:44:08.510 --> 00:44:08.520 align:start position:0%
that's why these attorney generals and
 
00:44:10.609 --> 00:44:10.619 align:start position:0%
that's why these other states have taken
 
00:44:13.309 --> 00:44:13.319 align:start position:0%
action is the the federal government is
 
00:44:15.349 --> 00:44:15.359 align:start position:0%
right now moving in in a different
 
00:44:15.359 --> 00:44:17.150 align:start position:0%
right now moving in in a different
direction

00:44:17.150 --> 00:44:17.160 align:start position:0%
direction
 
00:44:19.430 --> 00:44:19.440 align:start position:0%
um whether or not whether or not you
 
00:44:20.750 --> 00:44:20.760 align:start position:0%
want to
 
00:44:23.210 --> 00:44:23.220 align:start position:0%
um have an investigation I mean
 
00:44:26.210 --> 00:44:26.220 align:start position:0%
certainly yes well this this bill
 
00:44:28.309 --> 00:44:28.319 align:start position:0%
specifically addresses the investment
 
00:44:31.370 --> 00:44:31.380 align:start position:0%
policies of the retirement system and
 
00:44:35.270 --> 00:44:35.280 align:start position:0%
the state treasurer yes uh and I believe
 
00:44:39.370 --> 00:44:39.380 align:start position:0%
that is within our control so we should
 
00:44:42.170 --> 00:44:42.180 align:start position:0%
or at least it's within our authority to
 
00:44:44.210 --> 00:44:44.220 align:start position:0%
make laws that affect them yes we can't
 
00:44:46.730 --> 00:44:46.740 align:start position:0%
we can't change the federal policy but
 
00:44:49.329 --> 00:44:49.339 align:start position:0%
we can deal with our Treasures
 
00:44:51.470 --> 00:44:51.480 align:start position:0%
Investments and we can deal with our
 
00:44:53.270 --> 00:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
Pension funds investments just like
 
00:44:55.849 --> 00:44:55.859 align:start position:0%
these other states have have done and
 
00:44:57.650 --> 00:44:57.660 align:start position:0%
are doing thank you
 
00:44:57.660 --> 00:44:58.630 align:start position:0%
are doing thank you
okay

00:44:58.630 --> 00:44:58.640 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:45:00.710 --> 00:45:00.720 align:start position:0%
representative Simon thank you again
 
00:45:02.450 --> 00:45:02.460 align:start position:0%
Madam chair
 
00:45:02.460 --> 00:45:06.890 align:start position:0%
Madam chair
um

00:45:06.890 --> 00:45:06.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:09.230 --> 00:45:09.240 align:start position:0%
just hypothetically speaking
 
00:45:11.809 --> 00:45:11.819 align:start position:0%
um because ESG is a movement and I agree
 
00:45:13.430 --> 00:45:13.440 align:start position:0%
once again I also agree with whether
 
00:45:14.569 --> 00:45:14.579 align:start position:0%
you're heading with us I just want to
 
00:45:15.710 --> 00:45:15.720 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're careful in how we
 
00:45:18.470 --> 00:45:18.480 align:start position:0%
do it what if every investment firm
 
00:45:21.050 --> 00:45:21.060 align:start position:0%
starts using ESG my concern is with the
 
00:45:24.230 --> 00:45:24.240 align:start position:0%
language not just that it would be
 
00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:24.970 align:start position:0%
language not just that it would be
um

00:45:24.970 --> 00:45:24.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:27.109 --> 00:45:27.119 align:start position:0%
prioritizing those things but would also
 
00:45:29.990 --> 00:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
work in concert with
 
00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:30.650 align:start position:0%
work in concert with
um

00:45:30.650 --> 00:45:30.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:32.750 --> 00:45:32.760 align:start position:0%
would we potentially run out of options
 
00:45:34.609 --> 00:45:34.619 align:start position:0%
of people to
 
00:45:36.530 --> 00:45:36.540 align:start position:0%
invest in if that is part of the
 
00:45:38.870 --> 00:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
language and secondarily if I'm a Madam
 
00:45:42.050 --> 00:45:42.060 align:start position:0%
chair at the same time have
 
00:45:44.750 --> 00:45:44.760 align:start position:0%
we looked at other states who are doing
 
00:45:46.430 --> 00:45:46.440 align:start position:0%
this and it's working have we looked at
 
00:45:47.750 --> 00:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
their language and compared it to the
 
00:45:49.569 --> 00:45:49.579 align:start position:0%
language that we're using in this Bill
 
00:45:53.270 --> 00:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
yes this this language second part first
 
00:45:56.390 --> 00:45:56.400 align:start position:0%
this language largely came from uh
 
00:45:58.609 --> 00:45:58.619 align:start position:0%
discussing this with with other states
 
00:46:02.210 --> 00:46:02.220 align:start position:0%
so we are in in harmony
 
00:46:05.870 --> 00:46:05.880 align:start position:0%
um and as I mentioned through climate
 
00:46:08.870 --> 00:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
change 100 and the Global Financial
 
00:46:11.569 --> 00:46:11.579 align:start position:0%
Alliance for Net Zero and and the
 
00:46:13.970 --> 00:46:13.980 align:start position:0%
companies involved in that it's around
 
00:46:13.980 --> 00:46:16.250 align:start position:0%
companies involved in that it's around
uh

00:46:16.250 --> 00:46:16.260 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:46:18.890 --> 00:46:18.900 align:start position:0%
40 percent of the companies are involved
 
00:46:21.829 --> 00:46:21.839 align:start position:0%
so sixty percent of them are not and
 
00:46:24.290 --> 00:46:24.300 align:start position:0%
because the of this issue arising there
 
00:46:26.690 --> 00:46:26.700 align:start position:0%
are Financial investment firms that are
 
00:46:28.970 --> 00:46:28.980 align:start position:0%
that are popping up that are saying our
 
00:46:32.329 --> 00:46:32.339 align:start position:0%
focus is to be a traditional company we
 
00:46:35.870 --> 00:46:35.880 align:start position:0%
are not getting into this ESG Arena
 
00:46:39.109 --> 00:46:39.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:40.670 --> 00:46:40.680 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative
 
00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:43.130 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative
Bernardi

00:46:43.130 --> 00:46:43.140 align:start position:0%
Bernardi
 
00:47:06.109 --> 00:47:06.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:08.690 --> 00:47:08.700 align:start position:0%
since the treasure isn't here I presume
 
00:47:10.430 --> 00:47:10.440 align:start position:0%
that your comments also apply to the
 
00:47:10.440 --> 00:47:18.370 align:start position:0%
that your comments also apply to the
treasury

00:47:18.370 --> 00:47:18.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:23.890 --> 00:47:23.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:33.770 --> 00:47:33.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:35.390 --> 00:47:35.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for the record my name is
 
00:47:37.069 --> 00:47:37.079 align:start position:0%
Marty Carlin representing the New
 
00:47:40.190 --> 00:47:40.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire retirement system uh our nhrs
 
00:47:42.050 --> 00:47:42.060 align:start position:0%
board has not taken a position on this
 
00:47:45.050 --> 00:47:45.060 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation as yet I provided
 
00:47:46.790 --> 00:47:46.800 align:start position:0%
some some written testimony as
 
00:47:49.250 --> 00:47:49.260 align:start position:0%
background that I had um
 
00:47:51.470 --> 00:47:51.480 align:start position:0%
like to read and then address a couple
 
00:47:53.630 --> 00:47:53.640 align:start position:0%
of the issues that came up in the prior
 
00:47:53.640 --> 00:47:55.430 align:start position:0%
of the issues that came up in the prior
testimony

00:47:55.430 --> 00:47:55.440 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
00:47:57.710 --> 00:47:57.720 align:start position:0%
um the nhrs board has had a
 
00:47:59.329 --> 00:47:59.339 align:start position:0%
long-standing concern about any
 
00:48:01.309 --> 00:48:01.319 align:start position:0%
legislation that could potentially
 
00:48:03.589 --> 00:48:03.599 align:start position:0%
impair our fiduciary duty to act in the
 
00:48:05.329 --> 00:48:05.339 align:start position:0%
best interests of our members
 
00:48:07.730 --> 00:48:07.740 align:start position:0%
under existing constitutional and
 
00:48:09.470 --> 00:48:09.480 align:start position:0%
statutory Provisions governing their
 
00:48:11.510 --> 00:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
Retirement System in New Hampshire as
 
00:48:13.130 --> 00:48:13.140 align:start position:0%
well as general trust law under the
 
00:48:15.589 --> 00:48:15.599 align:start position:0%
Internal Revenue code fiduciaries must
 
00:48:18.530 --> 00:48:18.540 align:start position:0%
follow the duty of loyalty at all times
 
00:48:23.870 --> 00:48:23.880 align:start position:0%
pursuant to RSA 10a1 a sub paragraph A1
 
00:48:26.630 --> 00:48:26.640 align:start position:0%
this Duty requires nhrs fiduciaries
 
00:48:28.250 --> 00:48:28.260 align:start position:0%
including its Board of Trustees and
 
00:48:29.809 --> 00:48:29.819 align:start position:0%
members of the independent investment
 
00:48:32.329 --> 00:48:32.339 align:start position:0%
committee to make decisions solely in
 
00:48:34.069 --> 00:48:34.079 align:start position:0%
the interest of the participants and
 
00:48:34.079 --> 00:48:35.690 align:start position:0%
the interest of the participants and
beneficiaries

00:48:35.690 --> 00:48:35.700 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries
 
00:48:38.150 --> 00:48:38.160 align:start position:0%
further Eden read the rest of it what's
 
00:48:41.990 --> 00:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
what's the issue if if you indulge me
 
00:48:43.670 --> 00:48:43.680 align:start position:0%
please I'll skip the Constitutional
 
00:48:46.130 --> 00:48:46.140 align:start position:0%
provision but in Lay terms the goal has
 
00:48:48.530 --> 00:48:48.540 align:start position:0%
always been and continues to be to make
 
00:48:50.210 --> 00:48:50.220 align:start position:0%
prudent long-term investment that
 
00:48:52.190 --> 00:48:52.200 align:start position:0%
provide the best chance of meeting on or
 
00:48:53.510 --> 00:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
exceeding our assumed rate of return
 
00:48:56.569 --> 00:48:56.579 align:start position:0%
while balancing risk and liquidity this
 
00:48:58.849 --> 00:48:58.859 align:start position:0%
isn't a new position specific to this
 
00:48:58.859 --> 00:49:00.349 align:start position:0%
isn't a new position specific to this
legislation

00:49:00.349 --> 00:49:00.359 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:49:03.290 --> 00:49:03.300 align:start position:0%
back in 1987 legislation was considered
 
00:49:05.690 --> 00:49:05.700 align:start position:0%
that to mandate that the retirement
 
00:49:07.430 --> 00:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
system divests from companies that did
 
00:49:09.109 --> 00:49:09.119 align:start position:0%
business in Northern Ireland and failed
 
00:49:11.450 --> 00:49:11.460 align:start position:0%
to make substantial action regarding the
 
00:49:13.730 --> 00:49:13.740 align:start position:0%
McBride principles which was a framework
 
00:49:15.710 --> 00:49:15.720 align:start position:0%
dealing with hiring practices regarding
 
00:49:17.510 --> 00:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
underrepresented religious groups in
 
00:49:20.569 --> 00:49:20.579 align:start position:0%
Northern Ireland basically Catholics at
 
00:49:22.550 --> 00:49:22.560 align:start position:0%
the time external legal counsel warned
 
00:49:24.290 --> 00:49:24.300 align:start position:0%
nhrs that legislation adding
 
00:49:26.329 --> 00:49:26.339 align:start position:0%
non-fiduciary factors to the use of
 
00:49:28.370 --> 00:49:28.380 align:start position:0%
retirement funds would mean that funds
 
00:49:29.630 --> 00:49:29.640 align:start position:0%
would no longer be used for the
 
00:49:31.609 --> 00:49:31.619 align:start position:0%
exclusive purpose of providing benefits
 
00:49:33.829 --> 00:49:33.839 align:start position:0%
but would also be used for the Divergent
 
00:49:35.510 --> 00:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
collateral purpose of affecting social
 
00:49:37.910 --> 00:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
or political change
 
00:49:40.069 --> 00:49:40.079 align:start position:0%
regardless of the how well-intentioned
 
00:49:42.650 --> 00:49:42.660 align:start position:0%
the goal of this legislation may be our
 
00:49:44.450 --> 00:49:44.460 align:start position:0%
overall concern is that proposals such
 
00:49:46.190 --> 00:49:46.200 align:start position:0%
as this whether emanating from the left
 
00:49:47.870 --> 00:49:47.880 align:start position:0%
or the right of the political Spectrum
 
00:49:49.849 --> 00:49:49.859 align:start position:0%
have the potential to curtail our
 
00:49:51.530 --> 00:49:51.540 align:start position:0%
ability to effectively discharge our
 
00:49:53.630 --> 00:49:53.640 align:start position:0%
fiduciary duty
 
00:49:57.050 --> 00:49:57.060 align:start position:0%
um so that basically you know I think we
 
00:49:58.490 --> 00:49:58.500 align:start position:0%
had a similar comments about a China
 
00:50:00.290 --> 00:50:00.300 align:start position:0%
Bill last year and there's a bill I
 
00:50:01.490 --> 00:50:01.500 align:start position:0%
believe that Kenny will be hearing next
 
00:50:04.010 --> 00:50:04.020 align:start position:0%
week but these these comments apply to
 
00:50:05.390 --> 00:50:05.400 align:start position:0%
as well
 
00:50:06.849 --> 00:50:06.859 align:start position:0%
um to address a couple of the questions
 
00:50:09.950 --> 00:50:09.960 align:start position:0%
as a Public Employee Employee Retirement
 
00:50:12.370 --> 00:50:12.380 align:start position:0%
System nhres is not subject to orisa
 
00:50:15.890 --> 00:50:15.900 align:start position:0%
there were rules promulgated recently
 
00:50:18.050 --> 00:50:18.060 align:start position:0%
regarding ESG the pre the prior
 
00:50:20.630 --> 00:50:20.640 align:start position:0%
administration had rules that banned ESG
 
00:50:23.930 --> 00:50:23.940 align:start position:0%
so uh with with the um depending on the
 
00:50:25.190 --> 00:50:25.200 align:start position:0%
leadership in the white house we could
 
00:50:26.750 --> 00:50:26.760 align:start position:0%
see a lot of fluctuation over the years
 
00:50:28.910 --> 00:50:28.920 align:start position:0%
and what uh what we're talking about
 
00:50:31.430 --> 00:50:31.440 align:start position:0%
with ESG
 
00:50:35.510 --> 00:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
um one one thing about ESG is um
 
00:50:38.089 --> 00:50:38.099 align:start position:0%
how how is it used we don't have any
 
00:50:40.910 --> 00:50:40.920 align:start position:0%
funds that we invest in that prioritize
 
00:50:43.490 --> 00:50:43.500 align:start position:0%
environmental social governance issues
 
00:50:46.190 --> 00:50:46.200 align:start position:0%
over making as much money as we can for
 
00:50:47.809 --> 00:50:47.819 align:start position:0%
our members and beneficiaries there are
 
00:50:49.790 --> 00:50:49.800 align:start position:0%
some funds out there
 
00:50:52.549 --> 00:50:52.559 align:start position:0%
um that do that we do not invest in that
 
00:50:54.170 --> 00:50:54.180 align:start position:0%
we don't see that and that we would see
 
00:50:56.030 --> 00:50:56.040 align:start position:0%
that as a breach of our fiduciary duty
 
00:50:58.730 --> 00:50:58.740 align:start position:0%
to maximize investment returns for our
 
00:51:00.910 --> 00:51:00.920 align:start position:0%
members and retirees
 
00:51:03.589 --> 00:51:03.599 align:start position:0%
BlackRock does have funds that do that
 
00:51:05.930 --> 00:51:05.940 align:start position:0%
we have we have a substantial stake and
 
00:51:08.990 --> 00:51:09.000 align:start position:0%
a s p 500 Index Fund managed by
 
00:51:11.930 --> 00:51:11.940 align:start position:0%
BlackRock so there's no
 
00:51:14.270 --> 00:51:14.280 align:start position:0%
you know priority given to certain
 
00:51:16.730 --> 00:51:16.740 align:start position:0%
companies this is the s p and it's it's
 
00:51:18.589 --> 00:51:18.599 align:start position:0%
probably one of our lowest fee
 
00:51:20.349 --> 00:51:20.359 align:start position:0%
Investments so even if there were other
 
00:51:23.150 --> 00:51:23.160 align:start position:0%
managers offering s p index funds we're
 
00:51:24.710 --> 00:51:24.720 align:start position:0%
not sure if we would be paying more in
 
00:51:26.870 --> 00:51:26.880 align:start position:0%
fees for that which would arguably
 
00:51:28.490 --> 00:51:28.500 align:start position:0%
breach our fiduciary duty because we
 
00:51:30.950 --> 00:51:30.960 align:start position:0%
could get a better deal somewhere else
 
00:51:33.589 --> 00:51:33.599 align:start position:0%
um and and with ESG
 
00:51:35.030 --> 00:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
um you know I was looking
 
00:51:37.490 --> 00:51:37.500 align:start position:0%
um for some some background on on how
 
00:51:39.589 --> 00:51:39.599 align:start position:0%
that's assessed and I found some uh
 
00:51:42.890 --> 00:51:42.900 align:start position:0%
there's a paper put out last Fall by
 
00:51:46.490 --> 00:51:46.500 align:start position:0%
Alec the legislative researchers it's a
 
00:51:48.950 --> 00:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
non-profit National group of
 
00:51:51.710 --> 00:51:51.720 align:start position:0%
conservative lawmakers that proposes
 
00:51:53.510 --> 00:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
model legislation around the country for
 
00:51:57.309 --> 00:51:57.319 align:start position:0%
various topics and according to Alec
 
00:51:59.030 --> 00:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
environmental social corporate
 
00:52:00.890 --> 00:52:00.900 align:start position:0%
governance and other similarly oriented
 
00:52:03.410 --> 00:52:03.420 align:start position:0%
considerations are pecuniary factors
 
00:52:05.569 --> 00:52:05.579 align:start position:0%
only if they present economic risks or
 
00:52:07.970 --> 00:52:07.980 align:start position:0%
opportunities that qualified investment
 
00:52:10.190 --> 00:52:10.200 align:start position:0%
professionals was treat would treat as
 
00:52:11.930 --> 00:52:11.940 align:start position:0%
material economic conditions under
 
00:52:14.210 --> 00:52:14.220 align:start position:0%
generally accepted investment theories
 
00:52:16.490 --> 00:52:16.500 align:start position:0%
that is what our investment committee
 
00:52:20.450 --> 00:52:20.460 align:start position:0%
does now we don't prioritize or do that
 
00:52:23.030 --> 00:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
so you know the the
 
00:52:26.990 --> 00:52:27.000 align:start position:0%
reference to in concert would if if in
 
00:52:29.390 --> 00:52:29.400 align:start position:0%
fact 40 percent of managers even
 
00:52:32.870 --> 00:52:32.880 align:start position:0%
consider these factors that would lower
 
00:52:35.089 --> 00:52:35.099 align:start position:0%
reduce our investment Horizon by 45
 
00:52:38.510 --> 00:52:38.520 align:start position:0%
percent and you know in the fees and the
 
00:52:40.849 --> 00:52:40.859 align:start position:0%
quality of some of the other funds may
 
00:52:43.609 --> 00:52:43.619 align:start position:0%
not be as as robust as the returns we
 
00:52:46.309 --> 00:52:46.319 align:start position:0%
can get currently so
 
00:52:49.430 --> 00:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
um you know that there's there's that uh
 
00:52:53.990 --> 00:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
that piece to it as well and um
 
00:52:56.809 --> 00:52:56.819 align:start position:0%
you know uh and finally you know we for
 
00:52:59.930 --> 00:52:59.940 align:start position:0%
poor proxy eroding proxy voting of our
 
00:53:03.530 --> 00:53:03.540 align:start position:0%
investments our policy is
 
00:53:07.010 --> 00:53:07.020 align:start position:0%
um that any ESG proposals to a board
 
00:53:09.349 --> 00:53:09.359 align:start position:0%
will be considered based on potential
 
00:53:11.390 --> 00:53:11.400 align:start position:0%
impact on the long-term economic
 
00:53:13.790 --> 00:53:13.800 align:start position:0%
interests of the company generally we
 
00:53:15.470 --> 00:53:15.480 align:start position:0%
will abstain from such consideration
 
00:53:17.690 --> 00:53:17.700 align:start position:0%
absent a clear effect of The Proposal on
 
00:53:18.770 --> 00:53:18.780 align:start position:0%
Share value
 
00:53:22.190 --> 00:53:22.200 align:start position:0%
so that concludes my comments
 
00:53:24.829 --> 00:53:24.839 align:start position:0%
oh thank you despite your saying you're
 
00:53:27.290 --> 00:53:27.300 align:start position:0%
not taking a position it seems to me
 
00:53:29.890 --> 00:53:29.900 align:start position:0%
that you're taking a position against
 
00:53:33.950 --> 00:53:33.960 align:start position:0%
any restriction on the fiduciary duty of
 
00:53:35.930 --> 00:53:35.940 align:start position:0%
the Board of Trustees and the investment
 
00:53:38.450 --> 00:53:38.460 align:start position:0%
committee broadly speaking yes if this
 
00:53:40.730 --> 00:53:40.740 align:start position:0%
if this proposal was put forth to divest
 
00:53:43.130 --> 00:53:43.140 align:start position:0%
from fossil fuel companies by June 1st
 
00:53:44.990 --> 00:53:45.000 align:start position:0%
uh you know we would have the same
 
00:53:47.089 --> 00:53:47.099 align:start position:0%
concerns the other way and and you know
 
00:53:48.589 --> 00:53:48.599 align:start position:0%
one other
 
00:53:51.230 --> 00:53:51.240 align:start position:0%
so so specific to this legislation the
 
00:53:53.630 --> 00:53:53.640 align:start position:0%
board may take a position if it advances
 
00:53:55.069 --> 00:53:55.079 align:start position:0%
out of committee but as a general
 
00:54:01.010 --> 00:54:01.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:03.349 --> 00:54:03.359 align:start position:0%
um you know political or social goals on
 
00:54:07.069 --> 00:54:07.079 align:start position:0%
either end of the spectrum is of concern
 
00:54:09.250 --> 00:54:09.260 align:start position:0%
okay are there any specific questions
 
00:54:12.950 --> 00:54:12.960 align:start position:0%
representing a bear and then Gerhart
 
00:54:15.530 --> 00:54:15.540 align:start position:0%
Marty thank you for being here today so
 
00:54:19.630 --> 00:54:19.640 align:start position:0%
do you view ESG as a threat
 
00:54:23.030 --> 00:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
I'm not on the investment committee or
 
00:54:25.250 --> 00:54:25.260 align:start position:0%
or the director of Investments I you
 
00:54:25.260 --> 00:54:26.230 align:start position:0%
or the director of Investments I you
know

00:54:26.230 --> 00:54:26.240 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:54:29.089 --> 00:54:29.099 align:start position:0%
to the extent that it has an impact on
 
00:54:31.790 --> 00:54:31.800 align:start position:0%
Share value I I think we I can speak for
 
00:54:33.589 --> 00:54:33.599 align:start position:0%
an HRS that you know that would would be
 
00:54:37.010 --> 00:54:37.020 align:start position:0%
of concern to us if it's going to reduce
 
00:54:39.530 --> 00:54:39.540 align:start position:0%
um you know our ability to to earn what
 
00:54:42.530 --> 00:54:42.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:42.540 --> 00:54:49.030 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:54:49.030 --> 00:54:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:51.170 --> 00:54:51.180 align:start position:0%
I think the question I asked in the
 
00:54:52.309 --> 00:54:52.319 align:start position:0%
question you answered are two different
 
00:54:54.410 --> 00:54:54.420 align:start position:0%
things I think I asked if you thought
 
00:54:56.569 --> 00:54:56.579 align:start position:0%
ESG was a threat and I think what you
 
00:54:58.190 --> 00:54:58.200 align:start position:0%
answered is you think it would be a
 
00:55:00.109 --> 00:55:00.119 align:start position:0%
threat to put this legislation in place
 
00:55:04.010 --> 00:55:04.020 align:start position:0%
for what you for to meet your fiduciary
 
00:55:04.020 --> 00:55:05.450 align:start position:0%
for what you for to meet your fiduciary
responsibilities

00:55:05.450 --> 00:55:05.460 align:start position:0%
responsibilities
 
00:55:08.510 --> 00:55:08.520 align:start position:0%
we don't have any
 
00:55:08.520 --> 00:55:09.109 align:start position:0%
we don't have any
um

00:55:09.109 --> 00:55:09.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:12.349 --> 00:55:12.359 align:start position:0%
we don't prioritize or consider ESG in a
 
00:55:15.589 --> 00:55:15.599 align:start position:0%
vacuum is ESG is inherently good we're a
 
00:55:22.069 --> 00:55:22.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:23.930 --> 00:55:23.940 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:55:26.089 --> 00:55:26.099 align:start position:0%
just curious are there any places that
 
00:55:28.309 --> 00:55:28.319 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire shouldn't be investing
 
00:55:30.230 --> 00:55:30.240 align:start position:0%
I I you know in the the investment
 
00:55:32.089 --> 00:55:32.099 align:start position:0%
universe is you know if the federal
 
00:55:35.030 --> 00:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
government bans investments in certain
 
00:55:37.430 --> 00:55:37.440 align:start position:0%
countries you know Iran uh you know
 
00:55:39.530 --> 00:55:39.540 align:start position:0%
certain Chinese companies Russia you
 
00:55:42.530 --> 00:55:42.540 align:start position:0%
know you know that you know other than
 
00:55:44.750 --> 00:55:44.760 align:start position:0%
where we are legally prevented you know
 
00:55:47.030 --> 00:55:47.040 align:start position:0%
by by federal statute from investing in
 
00:55:49.130 --> 00:55:49.140 align:start position:0%
you know we will look for the best
 
00:55:50.990 --> 00:55:51.000 align:start position:0%
opportunities most of those are domestic
 
00:55:52.609 --> 00:55:52.619 align:start position:0%
equities that that's that's sort of our
 
00:55:55.549 --> 00:55:55.559 align:start position:0%
largest portfolio piece but um you know
 
00:55:57.530 --> 00:55:57.540 align:start position:0%
you know anything in the legal Universe
 
00:56:01.549 --> 00:56:01.559 align:start position:0%
we will consider if if it can
 
00:56:03.650 --> 00:56:03.660 align:start position:0%
meet you know if it can make money for
 
00:56:05.870 --> 00:56:05.880 align:start position:0%
the members and retirees and and grow
 
00:56:07.370 --> 00:56:07.380 align:start position:0%
the trust fund
 
00:56:09.470 --> 00:56:09.480 align:start position:0%
okay one follow-up yes and then
 
00:56:11.510 --> 00:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
representative thank you
 
00:56:14.329 --> 00:56:14.339 align:start position:0%
so as far if I remember correctly the
 
00:56:15.950 --> 00:56:15.960 align:start position:0%
implications well the reason for the
 
00:56:17.210 --> 00:56:17.220 align:start position:0%
rationale for this bill is more because
 
00:56:19.670 --> 00:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
of federal pressure might come down upon
 
00:56:21.410 --> 00:56:21.420 align:start position:0%
investment companies to make certain
 
00:56:24.230 --> 00:56:24.240 align:start position:0%
decisions so would the retirement fund
 
00:56:26.150 --> 00:56:26.160 align:start position:0%
be willing to nullify a federal decision
 
00:56:28.430 --> 00:56:28.440 align:start position:0%
if it interfered with earnings but it
 
00:56:30.470 --> 00:56:30.480 align:start position:0%
complied with federal law
 
00:56:33.290 --> 00:56:33.300 align:start position:0%
um the the Federal
 
00:56:35.210 --> 00:56:35.220 align:start position:0%
Provisions right now are under orisa
 
00:56:37.250 --> 00:56:37.260 align:start position:0%
which governs private retirement plans
 
00:56:39.589 --> 00:56:39.599 align:start position:0%
so we're not subject to orisa so any
 
00:56:42.049 --> 00:56:42.059 align:start position:0%
changes wouldn't affect us if if there
 
00:56:45.770 --> 00:56:45.780 align:start position:0%
was a a federal law passed
 
00:56:48.170 --> 00:56:48.180 align:start position:0%
um you know you know we would have to
 
00:56:50.410 --> 00:56:50.420 align:start position:0%
look at the law and you know if it does
 
00:56:53.089 --> 00:56:53.099 align:start position:0%
appear to breach fiduciary duty you know
 
00:56:55.250 --> 00:56:55.260 align:start position:0%
I you know I can't say until we we see a
 
00:56:57.349 --> 00:56:57.359 align:start position:0%
proposal but the the current changes
 
00:57:00.710 --> 00:57:00.720 align:start position:0%
alluded to with with orisa plans covered
 
00:57:02.510 --> 00:57:02.520 align:start position:0%
in private sector and Union retirement
 
00:57:04.849 --> 00:57:04.859 align:start position:0%
plans not you know low state and local
 
00:57:07.010 --> 00:57:07.020 align:start position:0%
government plans thank you
 
00:57:10.190 --> 00:57:10.200 align:start position:0%
representative thank you um kind of
 
00:57:12.530 --> 00:57:12.540 align:start position:0%
related to that if
 
00:57:14.870 --> 00:57:14.880 align:start position:0%
um the federal law does change to open
 
00:57:16.730 --> 00:57:16.740 align:start position:0%
up you know for uh public pension
 
00:57:19.549 --> 00:57:19.559 align:start position:0%
systems the uh the option to invest in
 
00:57:21.250 --> 00:57:21.260 align:start position:0%
those so basically loosening the
 
00:57:24.109 --> 00:57:24.119 align:start position:0%
requirement for investing strictly on a
 
00:57:27.530 --> 00:57:27.540 align:start position:0%
fiduciary duty basis what is in place
 
00:57:30.109 --> 00:57:30.119 align:start position:0%
if anything either in statute or
 
00:57:31.370 --> 00:57:31.380 align:start position:0%
something else
 
00:57:33.250 --> 00:57:33.260 align:start position:0%
that would require
 
00:57:36.290 --> 00:57:36.300 align:start position:0%
the investment committee to stay
 
00:57:38.210 --> 00:57:38.220 align:start position:0%
strictly with uh you know the best
 
00:57:40.809 --> 00:57:40.819 align:start position:0%
returns with reasonable risk for the
 
00:57:43.910 --> 00:57:43.920 align:start position:0%
pensioners and the taxpayers I think RSA
 
00:57:46.370 --> 00:57:46.380 align:start position:0%
1815 one that that proposal that I read
 
00:57:47.990 --> 00:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
the excerpt from it doesn't it doesn't
 
00:57:50.390 --> 00:57:50.400 align:start position:0%
prioritize anything above traditional
 
00:57:52.010 --> 00:57:52.020 align:start position:0%
fiduciary duty and that's a state
 
00:57:53.930 --> 00:57:53.940 align:start position:0%
statute so we would we would follow that
 
00:57:55.490 --> 00:57:55.500 align:start position:0%
that would
 
00:57:58.010 --> 00:57:58.020 align:start position:0%
if if the federal government said you
 
00:58:00.530 --> 00:58:00.540 align:start position:0%
can if you want to we we read New
 
00:58:02.089 --> 00:58:02.099 align:start position:0%
Hampshire line and constitutional
 
00:58:04.910 --> 00:58:04.920 align:start position:0%
provision that you know it would be
 
00:58:07.010 --> 00:58:07.020 align:start position:0%
um if we were prioritizing
 
00:58:09.370 --> 00:58:09.380 align:start position:0%
social or environmental goals over
 
00:58:11.930 --> 00:58:11.940 align:start position:0%
investment returns that we we wouldn't
 
00:58:13.790 --> 00:58:13.800 align:start position:0%
be able to do that under current the
 
00:58:15.710 --> 00:58:15.720 align:start position:0%
current statutory framework as it exists
 
00:58:17.690 --> 00:58:17.700 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:58:22.670 --> 00:58:22.680 align:start position:0%

good morning Madam chair and honorable
 
00:58:54.530 --> 00:58:54.540 align:start position:0%
members of the House Executive
 
00:58:56.690 --> 00:58:56.700 align:start position:0%
Department's Administration committee my
 
00:58:58.549 --> 00:58:58.559 align:start position:0%
name is Christy Merrill I'm president of
 
00:59:00.109 --> 00:59:00.119 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Bankers Association
 
00:59:02.750 --> 00:59:02.760 align:start position:0%
and with me today is Ryan Hale he is
 
00:59:03.829 --> 00:59:03.839 align:start position:0%

00:59:09.549 --> 00:59:09.559 align:start position:0%
we represent 38 member banks who employ
 
00:59:11.870 --> 00:59:11.880 align:start position:0%
approximately 6 000 people in New
 
00:59:13.609 --> 00:59:13.619 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and we are here today to
 
00:59:15.289 --> 00:59:15.299 align:start position:0%
provide testimony in opposition to
 
00:59:17.690 --> 00:59:17.700 align:start position:0%
houseboat 457.
 
00:59:19.370 --> 00:59:19.380 align:start position:0%
as it's drafted the legislation
 
00:59:20.930 --> 00:59:20.940 align:start position:0%
prohibits the state treasurer and the
 
00:59:22.670 --> 00:59:22.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire retirement system from
 
00:59:24.410 --> 00:59:24.420 align:start position:0%
engaging in business with any financial
 
00:59:26.930 --> 00:59:26.940 align:start position:0%
institution that prioritizes social
 
00:59:29.150 --> 00:59:29.160 align:start position:0%
political or ideological interests above
 
00:59:30.530 --> 00:59:30.540 align:start position:0%
or in concert with the traditional
 
00:59:32.089 --> 00:59:32.099 align:start position:0%
fiduciary duty to maximize Financial
 
00:59:35.630 --> 00:59:35.640 align:start position:0%
benefit we think that the the fiscal
 
00:59:37.730 --> 00:59:37.740 align:start position:0%
note on the legislation particularly the
 
00:59:39.049 --> 00:59:39.059 align:start position:0%
part by the New Hampshire retirement
 
00:59:42.470 --> 00:59:42.480 align:start position:0%
system really outlines very well I can't
 
00:59:44.510 --> 00:59:44.520 align:start position:0%
explain it better than they did in terms
 
00:59:46.789 --> 00:59:46.799 align:start position:0%
that they they describe the language
 
00:59:49.250 --> 00:59:49.260 align:start position:0%
used in the bill as being vague and
 
00:59:51.650 --> 00:59:51.660 align:start position:0%
undefined and that will be nearly
 
00:59:54.770 --> 00:59:54.780 align:start position:0%
impossible to enforce
 
00:59:56.750 --> 00:59:56.760 align:start position:0%
um as it's been pointed out similar
 
00:59:58.670 --> 00:59:58.680 align:start position:0%
legislation has been proposed in several
 
01:00:00.710 --> 01:00:00.720 align:start position:0%
other states around the country
 
01:00:03.950 --> 01:00:03.960 align:start position:0%
um and in fact Texas passed two bills in
 
01:00:06.589 --> 01:00:06.599 align:start position:0%
2021 and these proposals prohibited
 
01:00:08.510 --> 01:00:08.520 align:start position:0%
municipalities from doing business with
 
01:00:10.430 --> 01:00:10.440 align:start position:0%
banks that had environmental social and
 
01:00:12.890 --> 01:00:12.900 align:start position:0%
governance policies against the firearm
 
01:00:15.230 --> 01:00:15.240 align:start position:0%
and fossil fuel Industries
 
01:00:17.210 --> 01:00:17.220 align:start position:0%
um and I we just wanted to point out a
 
01:00:19.069 --> 01:00:19.079 align:start position:0%
recent study that was conducted by the
 
01:00:21.589 --> 01:00:21.599 align:start position:0%
Wharton School of Business at the
 
01:00:23.990 --> 01:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
University of Pennsylvania and they
 
01:00:25.670 --> 01:00:25.680 align:start position:0%
outlined that the impact of the
 
01:00:28.370 --> 01:00:28.380 align:start position:0%
proposals in Texas cost municipalities
 
01:00:32.510 --> 01:00:32.520 align:start position:0%
an additional 303 million to 532 million
 
01:00:36.170 --> 01:00:36.180 align:start position:0%
in interest on 32 billion in bonds due
 
01:00:38.930 --> 01:00:38.940 align:start position:0%
to less competition after several Banks
 
01:00:41.690 --> 01:00:41.700 align:start position:0%
left the state in that case the
 
01:00:43.490 --> 01:00:43.500 align:start position:0%
taxpayers of Texas are the one that's
 
01:00:46.609 --> 01:00:46.619 align:start position:0%
losing their New Hampshire is New
 
01:00:48.770 --> 01:00:48.780 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's economy is rightly the Envy
 
01:00:51.109 --> 01:00:51.119 align:start position:0%
of most and banks are proud to be part
 
01:00:53.390 --> 01:00:53.400 align:start position:0%
of that success they take great care in
 
01:00:55.250 --> 01:00:55.260 align:start position:0%
reviewing loan application and deposit
 
01:00:57.650 --> 01:00:57.660 align:start position:0%
accounts and every year Our member banks
 
01:00:59.150 --> 01:00:59.160 align:start position:0%
support our communities by lending
 
01:01:00.650 --> 01:01:00.660 align:start position:0%
hundreds of millions of dollars to New
 
01:01:03.049 --> 01:01:03.059 align:start position:0%
Hampshire businesses and families we've
 
01:01:05.569 --> 01:01:05.579 align:start position:0%
seen Banks continue to move here however
 
01:01:07.190 --> 01:01:07.200 align:start position:0%
we're concerned this legislation could
 
01:01:10.010 --> 01:01:10.020 align:start position:0%
have a chilling effect on that growth in
 
01:01:12.470 --> 01:01:12.480 align:start position:0%
closing we think it's it houseboat 457
 
01:01:15.170 --> 01:01:15.180 align:start position:0%
is vague and unenforceable and we would
 
01:01:17.150 --> 01:01:17.160 align:start position:0%
ask for an experience to legislate but
 
01:01:18.470 --> 01:01:18.480 align:start position:0%
um I know Ryan wanted to make a few
 
01:01:20.630 --> 01:01:20.640 align:start position:0%
comments as well
 
01:01:23.030 --> 01:01:23.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Christy and uh thank you madam
 
01:01:24.890 --> 01:01:24.900 align:start position:0%
chair and the rest of the committee
 
01:01:26.270 --> 01:01:26.280 align:start position:0%
um I just also wanted to point out
 
01:01:27.950 --> 01:01:27.960 align:start position:0%
Indiana is considering a bill very
 
01:01:30.230 --> 01:01:30.240 align:start position:0%
similar to this um and in their fiscal
 
01:01:33.410 --> 01:01:33.420 align:start position:0%
note uh they estimate uh that this could
 
01:01:36.470 --> 01:01:36.480 align:start position:0%
uh that the pension fund in Indiana the
 
01:01:39.289 --> 01:01:39.299 align:start position:0%
retirement system in Indiana could see
 
01:01:42.109 --> 01:01:42.119 align:start position:0%
um a 6.7 billion dollars could cost them
 
01:01:44.750 --> 01:01:44.760 align:start position:0%
6.7 billion dollars over the next 10
 
01:01:47.809 --> 01:01:47.819 align:start position:0%
years and reduced returns and that's uh
 
01:01:49.730 --> 01:01:49.740 align:start position:0%
they're managing I think a fund of
 
01:01:52.730 --> 01:01:52.740 align:start position:0%
around 2.3 billion dollars in assets so
 
01:01:54.589 --> 01:01:54.599 align:start position:0%
it's pretty significant to the
 
01:01:58.309 --> 01:01:58.319 align:start position:0%

Network many of whom have investments in
 
01:03:13.430 --> 01:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
interest in New Hampshire these are
 
01:03:16.370 --> 01:03:16.380 align:start position:0%
large corporations like Autodesk Akamai
 
01:03:17.569 --> 01:03:17.579 align:start position:0%
were then
 
01:03:17.579 --> 01:03:18.710 align:start position:0%
were then
um Biogen

01:03:18.710 --> 01:03:18.720 align:start position:0%
um Biogen
 
01:03:21.049 --> 01:03:21.059 align:start position:0%
we have strong concerns over House Bill
 
01:03:23.510 --> 01:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
457 which is prohibiting the state
 
01:03:25.010 --> 01:03:25.020 align:start position:0%
treasurer and New Hampshire retirement
 
01:03:27.170 --> 01:03:27.180 align:start position:0%
system from conducting conducting
 
01:03:28.970 --> 01:03:28.980 align:start position:0%
business with any financial institution
 
01:03:30.710 --> 01:03:30.720 align:start position:0%
that prioritize social politicism excuse
 
01:03:33.170 --> 01:03:33.180 align:start position:0%
me um we don't you don't need to read
 
01:03:35.990 --> 01:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
your testimony please tell us what the
 
01:03:37.609 --> 01:03:37.619 align:start position:0%
issues are
 
01:03:39.770 --> 01:03:39.780 align:start position:0%
um you know as representative Simon
 
01:03:42.049 --> 01:03:42.059 align:start position:0%
pointed out I think one of the key uh
 
01:03:43.609 --> 01:03:43.619 align:start position:0%
pieces of language and it is the
 
01:03:45.589 --> 01:03:45.599 align:start position:0%
prohibition on using any of these
 
01:03:47.510 --> 01:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
interests in concert with the
 
01:03:50.089 --> 01:03:50.099 align:start position:0%
traditional Financial fiduciary duty you
 
01:03:51.470 --> 01:03:51.480 align:start position:0%
know many investors including our
 
01:03:54.650 --> 01:03:54.660 align:start position:0%
members uh see these considerations as
 
01:03:57.109 --> 01:03:57.119 align:start position:0%
material to the financial performance of
 
01:03:59.390 --> 01:03:59.400 align:start position:0%
their Investments now regardless of your
 
01:04:01.069 --> 01:04:01.079 align:start position:0%
agreement with that statement it
 
01:04:02.450 --> 01:04:02.460 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be the government's role to
 
01:04:04.130 --> 01:04:04.140 align:start position:0%
dictate what considerations are allowed
 
01:04:05.690 --> 01:04:05.700 align:start position:0%
over the considered Judgment of
 
01:04:08.630 --> 01:04:08.640 align:start position:0%
financial Professionals in the field
 
01:04:10.849 --> 01:04:10.859 align:start position:0%
um you know adoption of this bill is
 
01:04:13.309 --> 01:04:13.319 align:start position:0%
effectively going to limit the options
 
01:04:15.589 --> 01:04:15.599 align:start position:0%
of active fund managers and investment
 
01:04:17.030 --> 01:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
opportunities for the State of New
 
01:04:19.430 --> 01:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the retirement system uh
 
01:04:21.470 --> 01:04:21.480 align:start position:0%
detailed analysis demonstrates this is
 
01:04:23.750 --> 01:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
going to cost the New Hampshire economy
 
01:04:26.690 --> 01:04:26.700 align:start position:0%
and citizens to reduce returns
 
01:04:29.150 --> 01:04:29.160 align:start position:0%
um I my testimony in my written
 
01:04:31.010 --> 01:04:31.020 align:start position:0%
testimony you'll see I similarly point
 
01:04:32.930 --> 01:04:32.940 align:start position:0%
to the fiscal note done by the Indiana
 
01:04:34.730 --> 01:04:34.740 align:start position:0%
State Legislative Services Commission
 
01:04:37.010 --> 01:04:37.020 align:start position:0%
certainly no Blue State
 
01:04:37.020 --> 01:04:37.670 align:start position:0%
certainly no Blue State
um

01:04:37.670 --> 01:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:40.069 --> 01:04:40.079 align:start position:0%
projecting a 6.7 billion dollar decrease
 
01:04:42.430 --> 01:04:42.440 align:start position:0%
to pension fund returns over 10 years
 
01:04:44.990 --> 01:04:45.000 align:start position:0%
Texas being one of the few states that
 
01:04:47.109 --> 01:04:47.119 align:start position:0%
has a similar law in place already
 
01:04:50.210 --> 01:04:50.220 align:start position:0%
analysis by the Wharton School has shown
 
01:04:53.270 --> 01:04:53.280 align:start position:0%
uh 300 to 532 million dollars in
 
01:04:55.549 --> 01:04:55.559 align:start position:0%
additional interests on the bonds result
 
01:04:58.609 --> 01:04:58.619 align:start position:0%
of restricting the number of banks that
 
01:05:00.109 --> 01:05:00.119 align:start position:0%
are able to compete for the state's
 
01:05:03.349 --> 01:05:03.359 align:start position:0%
business so this was a pension fund
 
01:05:05.630 --> 01:05:05.640 align:start position:0%
managers must consider all risks and
 
01:05:07.730 --> 01:05:07.740 align:start position:0%
opportunities in order to ensure the
 
01:05:09.710 --> 01:05:09.720 align:start position:0%
organizations remain profitable over the
 
01:05:14.270 --> 01:05:14.280 align:start position:0%
long term uh ESG concerns are considered
 
01:05:17.569 --> 01:05:17.579 align:start position:0%
material and if there is a flaw in that
 
01:05:20.930 --> 01:05:20.940 align:start position:0%
analysis those funds will have lower
 
01:05:22.910 --> 01:05:22.920 align:start position:0%
returns over time and the free market
 
01:05:25.730 --> 01:05:25.740 align:start position:0%
will move Capital away from them a bill
 
01:05:28.670 --> 01:05:28.680 align:start position:0%
like House Bill 457 is a government
 
01:05:32.270 --> 01:05:32.280 align:start position:0%
mandate saying that the fiduciary
 
01:05:34.309 --> 01:05:34.319 align:start position:0%
responsibility to considered Judgment of
 
01:05:36.490 --> 01:05:36.500 align:start position:0%
financial professionals fiduciary
 
01:05:39.829 --> 01:05:39.839 align:start position:0%
responsibility these must be breached in
 
01:05:41.510 --> 01:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
order to put these political concerns
 
01:05:44.690 --> 01:05:44.700 align:start position:0%
over their own analysis so it urged the
 
01:05:46.549 --> 01:05:46.559 align:start position:0%
committee to consider those severe
 
01:05:51.470 --> 01:05:51.480 align:start position:0%
implications and oppose the bill
 
01:05:54.470 --> 01:05:54.480 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Simon thank you
 
01:05:55.670 --> 01:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
madam chair thank you for taking my
 
01:05:55.680 --> 01:05:56.750 align:start position:0%
madam chair thank you for taking my
question

01:05:56.750 --> 01:05:56.760 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:05:58.849 --> 01:05:58.859 align:start position:0%
um when we're just for clarification
 
01:06:00.829 --> 01:06:00.839 align:start position:0%
purposes when we're talking about
 
01:06:00.839 --> 01:06:01.670 align:start position:0%
purposes when we're talking about
um

01:06:01.670 --> 01:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:04.849 --> 01:06:04.859 align:start position:0%
this kind of legislation affecting 6.7
 
01:06:06.410 --> 01:06:06.420 align:start position:0%
billion over I think it was 10 years for
 
01:06:08.390 --> 01:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
a 2.7 billion dollar fund you're
 
01:06:11.530 --> 01:06:11.540 align:start position:0%
calculating that predominantly using
 
01:06:14.450 --> 01:06:14.460 align:start position:0%
bonds that are accessible from Banks
 
01:06:16.190 --> 01:06:16.200 align:start position:0%
within the state's borders how is that
 
01:06:18.530 --> 01:06:18.540 align:start position:0%
specifically being calculated so that
 
01:06:19.730 --> 01:06:19.740 align:start position:0%
was the Indiana State Legislative
 
01:06:21.710 --> 01:06:21.720 align:start position:0%
Services Commission uh did the fiscal
 
01:06:23.569 --> 01:06:23.579 align:start position:0%
note I'm not familiar with all of the
 
01:06:25.490 --> 01:06:25.500 align:start position:0%
aspects of the analysis but certainly
 
01:06:26.870 --> 01:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
provide you with a copy of it would be
 
01:06:28.549 --> 01:06:28.559 align:start position:0%
helpful that would be fantastic if you
 
01:06:29.690 --> 01:06:29.700 align:start position:0%
wouldn't mind
 
01:06:33.470 --> 01:06:33.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:35.809 --> 01:06:35.819 align:start position:0%

corporations

01:06:56.270 --> 01:06:56.280 align:start position:0%

District 29 my testimony will be very
 
01:07:59.390 --> 01:07:59.400 align:start position:0%
brief because the the wisdom of the
 
01:08:01.970 --> 01:08:01.980 align:start position:0%
chair has introduced an amendment which
 
01:08:06.410 --> 01:08:06.420 align:start position:0%
will wipe out 278 in its entirety so I I
 
01:08:08.029 --> 01:08:08.039 align:start position:0%
don't see any point in really going into
 
01:08:11.750 --> 01:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
the details of 278 or of uh answering
 
01:08:13.069 --> 01:08:13.079 align:start position:0%
questions because it's going to
 
01:08:16.669 --> 01:08:16.679 align:start position:0%
disappear in the next hearing so thank
 
01:08:18.229 --> 01:08:18.239 align:start position:0%
you for your time
 
01:08:21.890 --> 01:08:21.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:21.900 --> 01:08:23.390 align:start position:0%

okay sounds great anybody else like to
 
01:08:33.050 --> 01:08:33.060 align:start position:0%
speak to this before the amendment comes
 
01:08:33.060 --> 01:08:34.550 align:start position:0%
speak to this before the amendment comes
up

01:08:34.550 --> 01:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:08:36.410 --> 01:08:36.420 align:start position:0%
seeing nobody I will close the hearing
 
01:08:39.729 --> 01:08:39.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:42.709 --> 01:08:42.719 align:start position:0%
and we're on time I will open the
 
01:08:44.689 --> 01:08:44.699 align:start position:0%
hearing on um
 
01:08:57.890 --> 01:08:57.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:07.610 --> 01:09:07.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:10.669 --> 01:09:10.679 align:start position:0%
Mr chair members of the committee
 
01:09:13.490 --> 01:09:13.500 align:start position:0%
the amendment was
 
01:09:17.150 --> 01:09:17.160 align:start position:0%
wipes out all of House Bill 278 based on
 
01:09:19.070 --> 01:09:19.080 align:start position:0%
my experience with an identical Bill
 
01:09:22.610 --> 01:09:22.620 align:start position:0%
last session which would allow
 
01:09:25.990 --> 01:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
retired police officers to work special
 
01:09:28.669 --> 01:09:28.679 align:start position:0%
special Duty
 
01:09:31.789 --> 01:09:31.799 align:start position:0%
on top of the Limited hours specified by
 
01:09:33.410 --> 01:09:33.420 align:start position:0%
the retirement system
 
01:09:35.450 --> 01:09:35.460 align:start position:0%
if I'm wrong and the committee wants to
 
01:09:37.550 --> 01:09:37.560 align:start position:0%
support it this amendment could easily
 
01:09:40.070 --> 01:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
be in addition to instead of a
 
01:09:43.070 --> 01:09:43.080 align:start position:0%
replacement for but
 
01:09:46.789 --> 01:09:46.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:50.349 --> 01:09:50.359 align:start position:0%
the what it replaces it with
 
01:09:55.310 --> 01:09:55.320 align:start position:0%
is a fix for an inadvertent error made
 
01:09:55.320 --> 01:09:57.729 align:start position:0%
is a fix for an inadvertent error made
between

01:09:57.729 --> 01:09:57.739 align:start position:0%
between
 
01:10:00.229 --> 01:10:00.239 align:start position:0%
everyone in the legislature who didn't
 
01:10:04.550 --> 01:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
notice something happening OLS and the a
 
01:10:07.310 --> 01:10:07.320 align:start position:0%
publisher of our law books
 
01:10:09.290 --> 01:10:09.300 align:start position:0%
and that's what Marty will be here is
 
01:10:11.570 --> 01:10:11.580 align:start position:0%
here to tell you about
 
01:10:11.580 --> 01:10:14.150 align:start position:0%
here to tell you about
um

01:10:14.150 --> 01:10:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:17.090 --> 01:10:17.100 align:start position:0%
so I can't answer that
 
01:10:19.189 --> 01:10:19.199 align:start position:0%
anything other than this was a request
 
01:10:22.330 --> 01:10:22.340 align:start position:0%
to the retirement system and OLS to fix
 
01:10:25.910 --> 01:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
the mistakes that were made
 
01:10:28.610 --> 01:10:28.620 align:start position:0%
like answer questions about the
 
01:10:31.370 --> 01:10:31.380 align:start position:0%
about replacing the previous Bill if
 
01:10:31.380 --> 01:10:32.570 align:start position:0%
about replacing the previous Bill if
necessary

01:10:32.570 --> 01:10:32.580 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
01:10:36.950 --> 01:10:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:39.290 --> 01:10:39.300 align:start position:0%
representative Lucas thank you you
 
01:10:41.330 --> 01:10:41.340 align:start position:0%
mentioned based on your experience with
 
01:10:42.890 --> 01:10:42.900 align:start position:0%
a similar bill in the past can you
 
01:10:45.770 --> 01:10:45.780 align:start position:0%
briefly say what happened uh we killed
 
01:10:49.189 --> 01:10:49.199 align:start position:0%
it unanimously okay thank you
 
01:10:51.830 --> 01:10:51.840 align:start position:0%
and it was and it passed the house on
 
01:10:55.250 --> 01:10:55.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:57.050 --> 01:10:57.060 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
01:10:58.850 --> 01:10:58.860 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you
 
01:11:12.830 --> 01:11:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:15.530 --> 01:11:15.540 align:start position:0%
thank you and and for the record Marty
 
01:11:17.149 --> 01:11:17.159 align:start position:0%
Carlin from the New Hampshire retirement
 
01:11:19.430 --> 01:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
system the Hannah going around is just
 
01:11:21.350 --> 01:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
the existing statute which would not
 
01:11:23.450 --> 01:11:23.460 align:start position:0%
change under this amendment but just for
 
01:11:26.209 --> 01:11:26.219 align:start position:0%
reference if anyone was interested in it
 
01:11:29.390 --> 01:11:29.400 align:start position:0%
essentially we were alerted to an issue
 
01:11:31.189 --> 01:11:31.199 align:start position:0%
um by the office of legislative Services
 
01:11:34.370 --> 01:11:34.380 align:start position:0%
OLS a couple of weeks ago
 
01:11:35.630 --> 01:11:35.640 align:start position:0%
um that
 
01:11:40.070 --> 01:11:40.080 align:start position:0%
um in 2013 the paragraph seven was added
 
01:11:44.450 --> 01:11:44.460 align:start position:0%
to RSA 100 a16 and that added a an
 
01:11:46.250 --> 01:11:46.260 align:start position:0%
employer report and requirement for
 
01:11:50.510 --> 01:11:50.520 align:start position:0%
hours worked the in 2011 they created a
 
01:11:52.070 --> 01:11:52.080 align:start position:0%
weekly limit on how many hours of
 
01:11:54.110 --> 01:11:54.120 align:start position:0%
retiree could work and then a couple
 
01:11:55.610 --> 01:11:55.620 align:start position:0%
years later how many people are working
 
01:11:57.770 --> 01:11:57.780 align:start position:0%
I said well there's no requirement for
 
01:12:00.709 --> 01:12:00.719 align:start position:0%
them to report data to us so
 
01:12:03.470 --> 01:12:03.480 align:start position:0%
um the Committee created a bill that we
 
01:12:05.470 --> 01:12:05.480 align:start position:0%
had the employers had to report monthly
 
01:12:07.910 --> 01:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
weekly hours for everyone who was
 
01:12:10.610 --> 01:12:10.620 align:start position:0%
retired and working for them when the
 
01:12:12.950 --> 01:12:12.960 align:start position:0%
legislature passed that original bill in
 
01:12:16.490 --> 01:12:16.500 align:start position:0%
uh 2013 it included a five-year sunset
 
01:12:20.450 --> 01:12:20.460 align:start position:0%
on one one of 19. so the idea was to get
 
01:12:21.950 --> 01:12:21.960 align:start position:0%
this information for data collection
 
01:12:23.930 --> 01:12:23.940 align:start position:0%
purposes and then it was going to Sunset
 
01:12:26.410 --> 01:12:26.420 align:start position:0%
uh in the in the ensuing years between
 
01:12:29.810 --> 01:12:29.820 align:start position:0%
2013 and 18 this section of the law was
 
01:12:32.770 --> 01:12:32.780 align:start position:0%
amended um several times along the way
 
01:12:35.870 --> 01:12:35.880 align:start position:0%
uh employer penalty was added to it uh
 
01:12:38.630 --> 01:12:38.640 align:start position:0%
for non-reporting a compliance penalty
 
01:12:41.209 --> 01:12:41.219 align:start position:0%
that we we had the ability to assess and
 
01:12:43.850 --> 01:12:43.860 align:start position:0%
then in 2018 it was amended generally
 
01:12:47.149 --> 01:12:47.159 align:start position:0%
and significantly in House Bill 561 it
 
01:12:49.370 --> 01:12:49.380 align:start position:0%
it replaced the weekly limit with an
 
01:12:51.229 --> 01:12:51.239 align:start position:0%
annual limit on hours worked the change
 
01:12:52.610 --> 01:12:52.620 align:start position:0%
of the reporting requirement from
 
01:12:54.470 --> 01:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
monthly to annually
 
01:12:56.330 --> 01:12:56.340 align:start position:0%
you know it you know it's a completely
 
01:12:59.630 --> 01:12:59.640 align:start position:0%
different structure than it was but no
 
01:13:01.910 --> 01:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
one caught at the time that that repeal
 
01:13:04.310 --> 01:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
language from the 2013 enactment was
 
01:13:06.169 --> 01:13:06.179 align:start position:0%
still in the statute you know you know
 
01:13:08.930 --> 01:13:08.940 align:start position:0%
lurking out there in The Ether
 
01:13:11.390 --> 01:13:11.400 align:start position:0%
um so the the most recently amended
 
01:13:13.810 --> 01:13:13.820 align:start position:0%
version of House Bill
 
01:13:17.450 --> 01:13:17.460 align:start position:0%
561 took effect January 1st of 19 as did
 
01:13:18.890 --> 01:13:18.900 align:start position:0%
the repeal
 
01:13:22.130 --> 01:13:22.140 align:start position:0%
okay so I I learned all this from OLS
 
01:13:23.689 --> 01:13:23.699 align:start position:0%
um and they they heard about it only
 
01:13:23.699 --> 01:13:25.430 align:start position:0%
um and they they heard about it only
because

01:13:25.430 --> 01:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:13:28.070 --> 01:13:28.080 align:start position:0%
um the publisher of the bound statutes
 
01:13:30.410 --> 01:13:30.420 align:start position:0%
for the State of New Hampshire an editor
 
01:13:32.810 --> 01:13:32.820 align:start position:0%
uh with that West law uh Thompson
 
01:13:34.970 --> 01:13:34.980 align:start position:0%
Reuters pointing it out to them like hey
 
01:13:36.830 --> 01:13:36.840 align:start position:0%
I see this conflict what's up with this
 
01:13:40.070 --> 01:13:40.080 align:start position:0%
and and OLS alerted me to it
 
01:13:43.010 --> 01:13:43.020 align:start position:0%
um and ols's perspective and they don't
 
01:13:43.910 --> 01:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
feel like they have the full
 
01:13:46.610 --> 01:13:46.620 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction to say but the the statute
 
01:13:49.189 --> 01:13:49.199 align:start position:0%
has been in the law books printed and
 
01:13:50.689 --> 01:13:50.699 align:start position:0%
the official version of the law every
 
01:13:53.870 --> 01:13:53.880 align:start position:0%
year since 2019 it was never taken from
 
01:13:56.270 --> 01:13:56.280 align:start position:0%
the uh taken out of the statute and in
 
01:13:58.490 --> 01:13:58.500 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire the written bound version
 
01:14:00.890 --> 01:14:00.900 align:start position:0%
is is the official law even if it
 
01:14:02.390 --> 01:14:02.400 align:start position:0%
differs from online or you know some
 
01:14:05.450 --> 01:14:05.460 align:start position:0%
other version so so they believe we have
 
01:14:07.970 --> 01:14:07.980 align:start position:0%
the have the ability to enforce that you
 
01:14:09.530 --> 01:14:09.540 align:start position:0%
know report in retirement for the last
 
01:14:11.810 --> 01:14:11.820 align:start position:0%
three years but the language before you
 
01:14:13.970 --> 01:14:13.980 align:start position:0%
was drafted by them
 
01:14:16.490 --> 01:14:16.500 align:start position:0%
um and basically what it does is repeal
 
01:14:19.189 --> 01:14:19.199 align:start position:0%
the repeal of that section from 2009 19
 
01:14:22.610 --> 01:14:22.620 align:start position:0%
in a firm the the Amendments along the
 
01:14:26.510 --> 01:14:26.520 align:start position:0%
way uh in our ability to um to have
 
01:14:28.970 --> 01:14:28.980 align:start position:0%
enforced that law so I mean this is
 
01:14:31.310 --> 01:14:31.320 align:start position:0%
really sort of a bureaucratic Kafka
 
01:14:33.169 --> 01:14:33.179 align:start position:0%
thing that adds a little comic relief to
 
01:14:35.270 --> 01:14:35.280 align:start position:0%
it for sort of heavy day of bills that
 
01:14:36.470 --> 01:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
you're going to be talking about but
 
01:14:38.149 --> 01:14:38.159 align:start position:0%
that that's that's what this is all
 
01:14:38.159 --> 01:14:39.530 align:start position:0%
that that's that's what this is all
about

01:14:39.530 --> 01:14:39.540 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:14:44.450 --> 01:14:44.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:45.950 --> 01:14:45.960 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you very much thank
 
01:14:47.930 --> 01:14:47.940 align:start position:0%
you is there anybody else who wanted to
 
01:14:51.169 --> 01:14:51.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:53.209 --> 01:14:53.219 align:start position:0%
seeing no one I will close the public
 
01:14:53.219 --> 01:14:55.729 align:start position:0%
seeing no one I will close the public
hearing

01:14:55.729 --> 01:14:55.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:00.950 --> 01:15:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:00.960 --> 01:15:20.390 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:15:20.390 --> 01:15:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:22.729 --> 01:15:22.739 align:start position:0%
let's go into executive session on House
 
01:15:25.370 --> 01:15:25.380 align:start position:0%
Bill 278
 
01:15:28.430 --> 01:15:28.440 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to move ought to pass and
 
01:15:39.169 --> 01:15:39.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:40.790 --> 01:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
and I'll
 
01:15:43.729 --> 01:15:43.739 align:start position:0%
we just heard about that that's simply
 
01:15:43.739 --> 01:15:46.550 align:start position:0%
we just heard about that that's simply
fixing

01:15:46.550 --> 01:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:49.430 --> 01:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
fixing a mistake that nobody noticed the
 
01:15:52.790 --> 01:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
statute was repeal and we continued to
 
01:15:54.530 --> 01:15:54.540 align:start position:0%
amend it
 
01:15:57.050 --> 01:15:57.060 align:start position:0%
and the retirement system continued to
 
01:16:01.790 --> 01:16:01.800 align:start position:0%
enforce it so we'd like to
 
01:16:05.689 --> 01:16:05.699 align:start position:0%
clean up our act in this case
 
01:16:07.370 --> 01:16:07.380 align:start position:0%
and that's all like I want to say about
 
01:16:12.530 --> 01:16:12.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:16.550 --> 01:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
I'll just say that uh yes based on the
 
01:16:19.010 --> 01:16:19.020 align:start position:0%
sponsor's testimony and Mr Carlin's
 
01:16:21.590 --> 01:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
testimony stating that this is just
 
01:16:25.490 --> 01:16:25.500 align:start position:0%
housekeeping I think it's advised
 
01:16:27.709 --> 01:16:27.719 align:start position:0%
yes it would be embarrassing to have a
 
01:16:30.890 --> 01:16:30.900 align:start position:0%
repeal but was never noticed floating
 
01:16:32.750 --> 01:16:32.760 align:start position:0%
around the assistant
 
01:16:35.450 --> 01:16:35.460 align:start position:0%
all right does anyone else
 
01:16:37.669 --> 01:16:37.679 align:start position:0%
representative blackis yeah I'm just
 
01:16:37.679 --> 01:16:40.250 align:start position:0%
representative blackis yeah I'm just
wondering

01:16:40.250 --> 01:16:40.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:41.950 --> 01:16:41.960 align:start position:0%
what was the purpose of the original
 
01:16:45.709 --> 01:16:45.719 align:start position:0%
Sunset and if the idea at that time was
 
01:16:48.890 --> 01:16:48.900 align:start position:0%
that it didn't need to continue forever
 
01:16:51.290 --> 01:16:51.300 align:start position:0%
um well why should then why shouldn't we
 
01:16:54.649 --> 01:16:54.659 align:start position:0%
just repeal it rather than do this
 
01:16:54.659 --> 01:16:55.790 align:start position:0%
just repeal it rather than do this
was

01:16:55.790 --> 01:16:55.800 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:16:59.090 --> 01:16:59.100 align:start position:0%
at the time we thought we'd only needed
 
01:17:02.209 --> 01:17:02.219 align:start position:0%
to gather data and find out how how many
 
01:17:04.910 --> 01:17:04.920 align:start position:0%
people were
 
01:17:07.370 --> 01:17:07.380 align:start position:0%
we're working after retirement and how
 
01:17:10.270 --> 01:17:10.280 align:start position:0%
many hours and so forth
 
01:17:13.070 --> 01:17:13.080 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt was here at the
 
01:17:14.630 --> 01:17:14.640 align:start position:0%
time and representative goalie and
 
01:17:16.550 --> 01:17:16.560 align:start position:0%
representative schuett and we all
 
01:17:19.970 --> 01:17:19.980 align:start position:0%
thought well we just gather the data and
 
01:17:22.490 --> 01:17:22.500 align:start position:0%
then Sunset the requirement but it
 
01:17:25.970 --> 01:17:25.980 align:start position:0%
turned out over the the period that that
 
01:17:29.930 --> 01:17:29.940 align:start position:0%
happened we started wanting to enforce
 
01:17:34.370 --> 01:17:34.380 align:start position:0%
the limit and without data you can't
 
01:17:38.930 --> 01:17:38.940 align:start position:0%
so we somewhat changed the purpose of
 
01:17:43.010 --> 01:17:43.020 align:start position:0%
the reporting requirement okay thank you
 
01:17:46.610 --> 01:17:46.620 align:start position:0%
I asked representative true yeah
 
01:17:48.649 --> 01:17:48.659 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:17:48.659 --> 01:17:49.490 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
um

01:17:49.490 --> 01:17:49.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:52.250 --> 01:17:52.260 align:start position:0%
so the replace all is all it does is
 
01:17:56.689 --> 01:17:56.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:59.030 --> 01:17:59.040 align:start position:0%
has nothing to do with what the original
 
01:17:59.040 --> 01:18:01.250 align:start position:0%
has nothing to do with what the original
bill

01:18:01.250 --> 01:18:01.260 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:18:04.010 --> 01:18:04.020 align:start position:0%
wanted to do correct if you are
 
01:18:07.490 --> 01:18:07.500 align:start position:0%
concerned with the original bill we can
 
01:18:10.010 --> 01:18:10.020 align:start position:0%
we can discuss that but
 
01:18:13.729 --> 01:18:13.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:17.570 --> 01:18:17.580 align:start position:0%
it allows retired police to work as much
 
01:18:20.510 --> 01:18:20.520 align:start position:0%
as they want on special Duty which we
 
01:18:23.990 --> 01:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
have consistently opposed in other
 
01:18:27.770 --> 01:18:27.780 align:start position:0%
legislation so I just am making a bet
 
01:18:29.390 --> 01:18:29.400 align:start position:0%
that that's what the committee would
 
01:18:29.400 --> 01:18:30.890 align:start position:0%
that that's what the committee would
prefer

01:18:30.890 --> 01:18:30.900 align:start position:0%
prefer
 
01:18:34.189 --> 01:18:34.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:34.199 --> 01:18:35.510 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:18:35.510 --> 01:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:18:38.990 --> 01:18:39.000 align:start position:0%
I'll just add that my recollection of
 
01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:39.950 align:start position:0%
I'll just add that my recollection of
the

01:18:39.950 --> 01:18:39.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:18:42.950 --> 01:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
provision that was sunsetted coincides
 
01:18:46.430 --> 01:18:46.440 align:start position:0%
exactly with the chairs and I would also
 
01:18:49.430 --> 01:18:49.440 align:start position:0%
Echo that yes this committee has said no
 
01:18:53.750 --> 01:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
to this original type of proposal pretty
 
01:18:53.760 --> 01:18:59.390 align:start position:0%
to this original type of proposal pretty
consistently

01:18:59.390 --> 01:18:59.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:59.400 --> 01:19:04.970 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:19:04.970 --> 01:19:04.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:12.010 --> 01:19:12.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:15.649 --> 01:19:15.659 align:start position:0%
you know so it was real purely for
 
01:19:17.270 --> 01:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
statistical purposes we just sent
 
01:19:18.890 --> 01:19:18.900 align:start position:0%
somebody a letter says please don't do
 
01:19:21.590 --> 01:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
it the most recent Amendment does have a
 
01:19:23.750 --> 01:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
penalty on a retirement for exceeding so
 
01:19:25.430 --> 01:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
we would have no way to enforce it out
 
01:19:27.229 --> 01:19:27.239 align:start position:0%
without the report
 
01:19:31.370 --> 01:19:31.380 align:start position:0%
thank you representative thank you
 
01:19:34.610 --> 01:19:34.620 align:start position:0%
I I'm going to State my uh understanding
 
01:19:36.770 --> 01:19:36.780 align:start position:0%
of why this whole thing is in there and
 
01:19:38.450 --> 01:19:38.460 align:start position:0%
just let me know if it's correct because
 
01:19:40.209 --> 01:19:40.219 align:start position:0%
I wasn't around when it was put in place
 
01:19:43.250 --> 01:19:43.260 align:start position:0%
and my understanding is the concern
 
01:19:46.310 --> 01:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
that um if they you know officers could
 
01:19:49.070 --> 01:19:49.080 align:start position:0%
retire and then get lots of
 
01:19:52.130 --> 01:19:52.140 align:start position:0%
pay either special Duty or not then it
 
01:19:53.689 --> 01:19:53.699 align:start position:0%
might provide an incentive for people to
 
01:19:55.490 --> 01:19:55.500 align:start position:0%
retire early and then both get a pension
 
01:19:58.370 --> 01:19:58.380 align:start position:0%
and keep working is that the basic idea
 
01:20:00.950 --> 01:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
that was one of the main concerns yes
 
01:20:04.070 --> 01:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:05.810 --> 01:20:05.820 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt
 
01:20:07.610 --> 01:20:07.620 align:start position:0%
so that it
 
01:20:11.149 --> 01:20:11.159 align:start position:0%
the term hasn't been used today but uh
 
01:20:14.450 --> 01:20:14.460 align:start position:0%
double dipping is one of the frequent
 
01:20:16.850 --> 01:20:16.860 align:start position:0%
Banes of our existence on this Committee
 
01:20:19.450 --> 01:20:19.460 align:start position:0%
in this in this connection
 
01:20:23.990 --> 01:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
and is that not is this not how the
 
01:20:25.910 --> 01:20:25.920 align:start position:0%
question represented like us just asked
 
01:20:28.850 --> 01:20:28.860 align:start position:0%
not the kind of the definition of double
 
01:20:31.669 --> 01:20:31.679 align:start position:0%
dipping that you you get your you retire
 
01:20:34.490 --> 01:20:34.500 align:start position:0%
start taking your drawing your pen your
 
01:20:36.290 --> 01:20:36.300 align:start position:0%
pension and then you go back working
 
01:20:39.350 --> 01:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:41.510 --> 01:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
we don't like that as I understand it
 
01:20:45.350 --> 01:20:45.360 align:start position:0%
well yes and this would allow part-time
 
01:20:49.070 --> 01:20:49.080 align:start position:0%
allow a person to work part-time under
 
01:20:50.930 --> 01:20:50.940 align:start position:0%
one position and then work as much
 
01:20:52.189 --> 01:20:52.199 align:start position:0%
special do
 
01:20:55.130 --> 01:20:55.140 align:start position:0%
or extra duty pay extra Duty as they
 
01:20:58.250 --> 01:20:58.260 align:start position:0%
wished with no limit whatsoever
 
01:20:58.260 --> 01:20:59.149 align:start position:0%
wished with no limit whatsoever
um

01:20:59.149 --> 01:20:59.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:03.050 --> 01:21:03.060 align:start position:0%
are essentially back to full time
 
01:21:03.060 --> 01:21:04.790 align:start position:0%
are essentially back to full time
okay

01:21:04.790 --> 01:21:04.800 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:21:06.950 --> 01:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
any other comments
 
01:21:10.430 --> 01:21:10.440 align:start position:0%
okay then we have the amendment zero
 
01:21:13.149 --> 01:21:13.159 align:start position:0%
zero three four
 
01:21:18.290 --> 01:21:18.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:19.790 --> 01:21:19.800 align:start position:0%
if that wasn't what I said it's
 
01:21:25.669 --> 01:21:25.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:29.390 --> 01:21:29.400 align:start position:0%
okay so to adopt the amendment and the
 
01:21:31.010 --> 01:21:31.020 align:start position:0%
motion is to adopt the amendment and the
 
01:21:38.149 --> 01:21:38.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:40.430 --> 01:21:40.440 align:start position:0%
um representative
 
01:21:44.689 --> 01:21:44.699 align:start position:0%

all right seeing none we'll uh I think
 
01:23:14.149 --> 01:23:14.159 align:start position:0%
we should talk a minute to give the
 
01:23:17.950 --> 01:23:17.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:21.950 --> 01:23:21.960 align:start position:0%

representative a bear yes
 
01:23:53.030 --> 01:23:53.040 align:start position:0%
representative Gerhard
 
01:23:56.870 --> 01:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:58.910 --> 01:23:58.920 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt
 
01:24:02.689 --> 01:24:02.699 align:start position:0%
yes representative goalie yes
 
01:24:07.990 --> 01:24:08.000 align:start position:0%

01:24:21.490 --> 01:24:21.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:25.130 --> 01:24:25.140 align:start position:0%
okay the motion passes 15 to zero is
 
01:24:28.130 --> 01:24:28.140 align:start position:0%
there any objection to consent
 
01:24:30.770 --> 01:24:30.780 align:start position:0%
okay we'll put this on consent and I
 
01:24:33.470 --> 01:24:33.480 align:start position:0%
will write the committee report
 
01:24:35.990 --> 01:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
it's my convenience and now we only have
 
01:24:40.630 --> 01:24:40.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:43.430 --> 01:24:43.440 align:start position:0%
I have a question of the chair so it
 
01:24:46.910 --> 01:24:46.920 align:start position:0%
does have an FN on on the amendment does
 
01:24:49.370 --> 01:24:49.380 align:start position:0%
that influence uh whether we can put
 
01:24:53.209 --> 01:24:53.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:57.890 --> 01:24:57.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:00.709 --> 01:25:00.719 align:start position:0%
so that FM doesn't really apply to this
 
01:25:02.450 --> 01:25:02.460 align:start position:0%
right the amendment it seems the
 
01:25:04.850 --> 01:25:04.860 align:start position:0%
original Bill had a fiscal impact the
 
01:25:08.090 --> 01:25:08.100 align:start position:0%
amendment I don't believe does and
 
01:25:08.100 --> 01:25:08.630 align:start position:0%
amendment I don't believe does and
um

01:25:08.630 --> 01:25:08.640 align:start position:0%
um

clerk and the and the speaker will just
 
01:25:16.310 --> 01:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
pull it off consent and put it in the

House Bill 461 and I call Representative

House Bill 461 and I call Representative
Pearson

01:46:59.390 --> 01:46:59.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:01.250 --> 01:47:01.260 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair for the record
 
01:47:02.990 --> 01:47:03.000 align:start position:0%
Representative Steve Pearson Rockingham
 
01:47:05.149 --> 01:47:05.159 align:start position:0%
District 13 which encompasses
 
01:47:09.530 --> 01:47:09.540 align:start position:0%
spacetown USA Dairy so 461
 
01:47:14.510 --> 01:47:14.520 align:start position:0%
461 addresses a problem that
 
01:47:18.850 --> 01:47:18.860 align:start position:0%
was ex was it one time a one-off issue
 
01:47:22.750 --> 01:47:22.760 align:start position:0%
in the city of Franklin
 
01:47:25.790 --> 01:47:25.800 align:start position:0%
and then it happened again
 
01:47:28.070 --> 01:47:28.080 align:start position:0%
then it happened again
 
01:47:29.689 --> 01:47:29.699 align:start position:0%
and this is this is something that's
 
01:47:32.149 --> 01:47:32.159 align:start position:0%
been discussed by the Edna committee for
 
01:47:35.870 --> 01:47:35.880 align:start position:0%
a couple of years now and
 
01:47:39.470 --> 01:47:39.480 align:start position:0%
really needs to be addressed before this
 
01:47:42.109 --> 01:47:42.119 align:start position:0%
goes any further
 
01:47:44.570 --> 01:47:44.580 align:start position:0%
so what happened
 
01:47:44.580 --> 01:47:46.609 align:start position:0%
so what happened
was

01:47:46.609 --> 01:47:46.619 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:47:48.830 --> 01:47:48.840 align:start position:0%
as unfortunately occurs sometimes in law
 
01:47:52.070 --> 01:47:52.080 align:start position:0%
there are loopholes
 
01:47:56.090 --> 01:47:56.100 align:start position:0%
and a loophole was discovered and
 
01:47:59.870 --> 01:47:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:02.570 --> 01:48:02.580 align:start position:0%
the town of Hooksett a couple years ago
 
01:48:05.330 --> 01:48:05.340 align:start position:0%
and now by the town of Londonderry
 
01:48:07.669 --> 01:48:07.679 align:start position:0%
so what that loophole is
 
01:48:07.679 --> 01:48:09.830 align:start position:0%
so what that loophole is
is

01:48:09.830 --> 01:48:09.840 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:48:13.070 --> 01:48:13.080 align:start position:0%
a community would take a group two
 
01:48:13.080 --> 01:48:14.629 align:start position:0%
a community would take a group two
position

01:48:14.629 --> 01:48:14.639 align:start position:0%
position
 
01:48:16.729 --> 01:48:16.739 align:start position:0%
in this case in both cases a fire
 
01:48:18.709 --> 01:48:18.719 align:start position:0%
Chief's position
 
01:48:21.410 --> 01:48:21.420 align:start position:0%
and in essence decertify it to a
 
01:48:23.930 --> 01:48:23.940 align:start position:0%
part-time position
 
01:48:27.410 --> 01:48:27.420 align:start position:0%
but yet bring on board a person to
 
01:48:30.169 --> 01:48:30.179 align:start position:0%
fulfill the role of the fire chief
 
01:48:32.390 --> 01:48:32.400 align:start position:0%
in the case of Hooksett or in the case
 
01:48:34.250 --> 01:48:34.260 align:start position:0%
of Londonderry retire their Fire Chief
 
01:48:37.070 --> 01:48:37.080 align:start position:0%
and bring him right back
 
01:48:40.070 --> 01:48:40.080 align:start position:0%
now what that does in essence is it has
 
01:48:42.350 --> 01:48:42.360 align:start position:0%
two effects one it creates double
 
01:48:44.390 --> 01:48:44.400 align:start position:0%
dipping which
 
01:48:46.430 --> 01:48:46.440 align:start position:0%
this body has
 
01:48:46.440 --> 01:48:48.530 align:start position:0%
this body has
expressly

01:48:48.530 --> 01:48:48.540 align:start position:0%
expressly
 
01:48:48.540 --> 01:48:51.490 align:start position:0%
expressly
stated

01:48:51.490 --> 01:48:51.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:53.930 --> 01:48:53.940 align:start position:0%
that they're not in favor of
 
01:48:56.330 --> 01:48:56.340 align:start position:0%
the other thing that it did
 
01:48:59.090 --> 01:48:59.100 align:start position:0%
or it does is when you decertify a
 
01:49:01.129 --> 01:49:01.139 align:start position:0%
position and you put it to part-time all
 
01:49:03.709 --> 01:49:03.719 align:start position:0%
of a sudden the debt that you that that
 
01:49:05.930 --> 01:49:05.940 align:start position:0%
position has created as far as the
 
01:49:08.090 --> 01:49:08.100 align:start position:0%
unfunded liability goes
 
01:49:08.100 --> 01:49:10.490 align:start position:0%
unfunded liability goes
disappears

01:49:10.490 --> 01:49:10.500 align:start position:0%
disappears
 
01:49:11.870 --> 01:49:11.880 align:start position:0%
now of course the debt itself doesn't
 
01:49:13.850 --> 01:49:13.860 align:start position:0%
disappear the debt is very much still
 
01:49:15.649 --> 01:49:15.659 align:start position:0%
there but the responsibility of that
 
01:49:17.870 --> 01:49:17.880 align:start position:0%
Community as part of their payment of
 
01:49:19.070 --> 01:49:19.080 align:start position:0%
said debt
 
01:49:22.430 --> 01:49:22.440 align:start position:0%
now for some reason goes away
 
01:49:25.310 --> 01:49:25.320 align:start position:0%
so that debt is now transferred to other
 
01:49:27.109 --> 01:49:27.119 align:start position:0%
communities because we have to pay the
 
01:49:29.689 --> 01:49:29.699 align:start position:0%
debt so
 
01:49:31.970 --> 01:49:31.980 align:start position:0%
if your community finds a way out of
 
01:49:33.950 --> 01:49:33.960 align:start position:0%
paying the debt then someone else's
 
01:49:36.470 --> 01:49:36.480 align:start position:0%
Community is going to have to take that
 
01:49:36.480 --> 01:49:38.030 align:start position:0%
Community is going to have to take that
on

01:49:38.030 --> 01:49:38.040 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:49:40.729 --> 01:49:40.739 align:start position:0%
and that's really not fair that's not
 
01:49:42.770 --> 01:49:42.780 align:start position:0%
fair to the system it's not fair to
 
01:49:45.010 --> 01:49:45.020 align:start position:0%
other communities
 
01:49:47.209 --> 01:49:47.219 align:start position:0%
and it
 
01:49:49.850 --> 01:49:49.860 align:start position:0%
this is one of those cases whereas you
 
01:49:51.290 --> 01:49:51.300 align:start position:0%
know for those of us that are stewards
 
01:49:52.790 --> 01:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
of this system
 
01:49:54.890 --> 01:49:54.900 align:start position:0%
on the legislative side this is
 
01:49:57.109 --> 01:49:57.119 align:start position:0%
something that damages things
 
01:49:59.390 --> 01:49:59.400 align:start position:0%
and when we uncover things that do that
 
01:50:02.209 --> 01:50:02.219 align:start position:0%
it is in our best interest to to deal
 
01:50:04.430 --> 01:50:04.440 align:start position:0%
with them so this was discussed two
 
01:50:06.530 --> 01:50:06.540 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
01:50:09.050 --> 01:50:09.060 align:start position:0%
okay at the time we had
 
01:50:12.649 --> 01:50:12.659 align:start position:0%
a modern example and one from the 90s
 
01:50:16.070 --> 01:50:16.080 align:start position:0%
and it has become a
 
01:50:18.109 --> 01:50:18.119 align:start position:0%
glowingly obvious that we need to really
 
01:50:19.729 --> 01:50:19.739 align:start position:0%
nip this in the bud
 
01:50:21.590 --> 01:50:21.600 align:start position:0%
so the language that's the background
 
01:50:24.649 --> 01:50:24.659 align:start position:0%
the language basically says that if a
 
01:50:26.030 --> 01:50:26.040 align:start position:0%
political subdivision employer
 
01:50:28.669 --> 01:50:28.679 align:start position:0%
eliminates a group two position
 
01:50:31.070 --> 01:50:31.080 align:start position:0%
or transfers that position to a
 
01:50:34.729 --> 01:50:34.739 align:start position:0%
part-time position with
 
01:50:38.450 --> 01:50:38.460 align:start position:0%
that the retirement system needs to
 
01:50:42.050 --> 01:50:42.060 align:start position:0%
conduct an analysis of the debt of that
 
01:50:43.609 --> 01:50:43.619 align:start position:0%
position and that Community still needs
 
01:50:48.590 --> 01:50:48.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:51.169 --> 01:50:51.179 align:start position:0%
now how does one do that
 
01:50:53.270 --> 01:50:53.280 align:start position:0%
right because salaries change over time
 
01:50:55.250 --> 01:50:55.260 align:start position:0%
you could have an anomaly in a given
 
01:50:56.689 --> 01:50:56.699 align:start position:0%
year you could even have a community say
 
01:50:58.669 --> 01:50:58.679 align:start position:0%
you know what we're just gonna
 
01:51:00.410 --> 01:51:00.420 align:start position:0%
we're going to pay you this for a year
 
01:51:02.149 --> 01:51:02.159 align:start position:0%
and then bring you in part time so this
 
01:51:03.530 --> 01:51:03.540 align:start position:0%
is why there's a five-year look back
 
01:51:07.070 --> 01:51:07.080 align:start position:0%
this provides a a relative standard it's
 
01:51:09.830 --> 01:51:09.840 align:start position:0%
it it evens out maybe
 
01:51:12.410 --> 01:51:12.420 align:start position:0%
Ebbs and flows of salary and it provides
 
01:51:13.910 --> 01:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
a number for which the retirement system
 
01:51:18.169 --> 01:51:18.179 align:start position:0%
can base their analysis on
 
01:51:20.990 --> 01:51:21.000 align:start position:0%
now in the interest of of discouraging
 
01:51:22.850 --> 01:51:22.860 align:start position:0%
this type of activity
 
01:51:27.350 --> 01:51:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:31.430 --> 01:51:31.440 align:start position:0%
because it's not just a matter of not
 
01:51:33.709 --> 01:51:33.719 align:start position:0%
paying the unfunded portion
 
01:51:36.950 --> 01:51:36.960 align:start position:0%
but the the retirement system requires
 
01:51:39.410 --> 01:51:39.420 align:start position:0%
income from folks in those positions
 
01:51:41.510 --> 01:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
that come out of their paychecks 80
 
01:51:44.270 --> 01:51:44.280 align:start position:0%
roughly round numbers 80 percent of the
 
01:51:46.370 --> 01:51:46.380 align:start position:0%
benefits that are paid out in a given
 
01:51:48.350 --> 01:51:48.360 align:start position:0%
year come right out of the paychecks of
 
01:51:52.430 --> 01:51:52.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:55.669 --> 01:51:55.679 align:start position:0%
so to prevent those three occurrences
 
01:51:57.950 --> 01:51:57.960 align:start position:0%
from causing harm to the system the 20
 
01:52:01.010 --> 01:52:01.020 align:start position:0%
penalty is in there to discourage this
 
01:52:03.470 --> 01:52:03.480 align:start position:0%
activity we're not we can't prohibit it
 
01:52:05.990 --> 01:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
we cannot tell a town
 
01:52:07.669 --> 01:52:07.679 align:start position:0%
that they're going to eliminate a
 
01:52:07.679 --> 01:52:09.890 align:start position:0%
that they're going to eliminate a
position

01:52:09.890 --> 01:52:09.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:12.050 --> 01:52:12.060 align:start position:0%
that would start to fly in the face of
 
01:52:12.060 --> 01:52:13.250 align:start position:0%
that would start to fly in the face of
28a

01:52:13.250 --> 01:52:13.260 align:start position:0%
28a
 
01:52:15.229 --> 01:52:15.239 align:start position:0%
but what we're going to say is if you do
 
01:52:17.570 --> 01:52:17.580 align:start position:0%
eliminate that position the debt that
 
01:52:20.090 --> 01:52:20.100 align:start position:0%
you have incurred on that position you
 
01:52:23.090 --> 01:52:23.100 align:start position:0%
are still responsible for
 
01:52:26.149 --> 01:52:26.159 align:start position:0%
that is the gist
 
01:52:31.970 --> 01:52:31.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:33.649 --> 01:52:33.659 align:start position:0%
uh represent Pearson I have a question
 
01:52:36.229 --> 01:52:36.239 align:start position:0%
sure why are you limiting this to group
 
01:52:39.290 --> 01:52:39.300 align:start position:0%
two I know that the Pittsfield school
 
01:52:41.030 --> 01:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
system did something similar they
 
01:52:43.370 --> 01:52:43.380 align:start position:0%
retired their superintendent and brought
 
01:52:46.729 --> 01:52:46.739 align:start position:0%
them back part-time
 
01:52:48.590 --> 01:52:48.600 align:start position:0%
um good question and I know that the
 
01:52:48.600 --> 01:52:49.910 align:start position:0%
um good question and I know that the
counties

01:52:49.910 --> 01:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
counties
 
01:52:49.920 --> 01:52:51.530 align:start position:0%
counties
in

01:52:51.530 --> 01:52:51.540 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:52:53.270 --> 01:52:53.280 align:start position:0%
have been saying well we'll save money
 
01:52:54.950 --> 01:52:54.960 align:start position:0%
by not having to make retirement
 
01:52:57.290 --> 01:52:57.300 align:start position:0%
contributions if we bring in a retired
 
01:53:00.290 --> 01:53:00.300 align:start position:0%
person to do this job
 
01:53:02.510 --> 01:53:02.520 align:start position:0%
so to answer your question Madam chair
 
01:53:05.930 --> 01:53:05.940 align:start position:0%
the reasoning was simply because we saw
 
01:53:08.090 --> 01:53:08.100 align:start position:0%
examples of this in the group 2 world
 
01:53:10.970 --> 01:53:10.980 align:start position:0%
and I was not aware of
 
01:53:13.250 --> 01:53:13.260 align:start position:0%
examples in the group one world I am
 
01:53:15.290 --> 01:53:15.300 align:start position:0%
certainly not opposed
 
01:53:18.950 --> 01:53:18.960 align:start position:0%
to this applying to both if there are if
 
01:53:20.510 --> 01:53:20.520 align:start position:0%
we do have a problem in group one as
 
01:53:20.520 --> 01:53:21.649 align:start position:0%
we do have a problem in group one as
well

01:53:21.649 --> 01:53:21.659 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:53:25.729 --> 01:53:25.739 align:start position:0%
okay thank you so it was an inadvertent
 
01:53:27.830 --> 01:53:27.840 align:start position:0%
omission and not a conscious decision
 
01:53:30.470 --> 01:53:30.480 align:start position:0%
absolutely correct does anyone else have
 
01:53:33.350 --> 01:53:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:36.410 --> 01:53:36.420 align:start position:0%
yes thank you representative leckis
 
01:53:38.390 --> 01:53:38.400 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
 
01:53:38.400 --> 01:53:39.649 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
um

01:53:39.649 --> 01:53:39.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:43.850 --> 01:53:43.860 align:start position:0%
so I initially I was I was uh kind of
 
01:53:45.770 --> 01:53:45.780 align:start position:0%
concerned about the 20 penalty and
 
01:53:48.169 --> 01:53:48.179 align:start position:0%
wasn't necessarily happy with it but I
 
01:53:49.629 --> 01:53:49.639 align:start position:0%
have a question
 
01:53:52.669 --> 01:53:52.679 align:start position:0%
normally if you have a a regular
 
01:53:55.669 --> 01:53:55.679 align:start position:0%
full-time person in there then over time
 
01:53:58.070 --> 01:53:58.080 align:start position:0%
their salary tends to go up both as
 
01:53:59.570 --> 01:53:59.580 align:start position:0%
they're in the position longer and
 
01:54:01.729 --> 01:54:01.739 align:start position:0%
compensate for inflation whatever but
 
01:54:03.770 --> 01:54:03.780 align:start position:0%
with this five-year look back that's
 
01:54:06.290 --> 01:54:06.300 align:start position:0%
going to be a fixed number right it's
 
01:54:08.930 --> 01:54:08.940 align:start position:0%
it's not going to be increased yeah the
 
01:54:10.790 --> 01:54:10.800 align:start position:0%
idea of a five-year look back would be
 
01:54:14.330 --> 01:54:14.340 align:start position:0%
to look at whatever the highest salary
 
01:54:16.370 --> 01:54:16.380 align:start position:0%
that was give that was offered during
 
01:54:18.950 --> 01:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
that five-year period that just prevents
 
01:54:21.290 --> 01:54:21.300 align:start position:0%
that's trying to prevent a loophole in
 
01:54:25.070 --> 01:54:25.080 align:start position:0%
essence of of planning this event
 
01:54:26.750 --> 01:54:26.760 align:start position:0%
when you decide you're going to go this
 
01:54:29.689 --> 01:54:29.699 align:start position:0%
route with someone you really like who
 
01:54:31.490 --> 01:54:31.500 align:start position:0%
wants to retire but yet keep doing the
 
01:54:34.669 --> 01:54:34.679 align:start position:0%
same job follow up follow up thank you
 
01:54:34.679 --> 01:54:35.629 align:start position:0%
same job follow up follow up thank you
um

01:54:35.629 --> 01:54:35.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:38.689 --> 01:54:38.699 align:start position:0%
right but the there's still some Ben I'm
 
01:54:40.729 --> 01:54:40.739 align:start position:0%
asking you it looks like and tell me if
 
01:54:41.689 --> 01:54:41.699 align:start position:0%
I'm right that there's still some
 
01:54:43.910 --> 01:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
benefit to the employer
 
01:54:45.950 --> 01:54:45.960 align:start position:0%
because and it may be small but because
 
01:54:48.770 --> 01:54:48.780 align:start position:0%
they're that number is fixed whereas a
 
01:54:50.030 --> 01:54:50.040 align:start position:0%
salary for an actual employee is
 
01:54:52.370 --> 01:54:52.380 align:start position:0%
probably going to ride they would still
 
01:54:54.350 --> 01:54:54.360 align:start position:0%
be paying less
 
01:54:56.870 --> 01:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
um towards the uaal as well as pension
 
01:54:58.850 --> 01:54:58.860 align:start position:0%
benefits thank you for explaining why I
 
01:55:03.290 --> 01:55:03.300 align:start position:0%
put the 20 penalty in there thank you
 
01:55:06.350 --> 01:55:06.360 align:start position:0%
other other questions yes representative
 
01:55:06.360 --> 01:55:07.609 align:start position:0%
other other questions yes representative
Bailey

01:55:07.609 --> 01:55:07.619 align:start position:0%
Bailey
 
01:55:09.890 --> 01:55:09.900 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:55:09.900 --> 01:55:11.870 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
um

01:55:11.870 --> 01:55:11.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:15.830 --> 01:55:15.840 align:start position:0%
is is it always the same I've heard at
 
01:55:18.530 --> 01:55:18.540 align:start position:0%
candidates nights and things that uh
 
01:55:20.870 --> 01:55:20.880 align:start position:0%
the fire an elective fire chief is not
 
01:55:23.570 --> 01:55:23.580 align:start position:0%
necessarily in group two correct because
 
01:55:26.810 --> 01:55:26.820 align:start position:0%
they're not full-time so then if
 
01:55:29.750 --> 01:55:29.760 align:start position:0%
so if you started with a uh follow-up
 
01:55:34.010 --> 01:55:34.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:36.410 --> 01:55:36.420 align:start position:0%
if uh
 
01:55:38.810 --> 01:55:38.820 align:start position:0%
if one fire chief was an actual Fire
 
01:55:40.430 --> 01:55:40.440 align:start position:0%
Chief and was certified in the whole
 
01:55:40.440 --> 01:55:41.270 align:start position:0%
Chief and was certified in the whole
thing

01:55:41.270 --> 01:55:41.280 align:start position:0%
thing
 
01:55:43.550 --> 01:55:43.560 align:start position:0%
and it was not re-elected in favor of
 
01:55:45.770 --> 01:55:45.780 align:start position:0%
somebody who was not certified and not a
 
01:55:47.390 --> 01:55:47.400 align:start position:0%
fire chief
 
01:55:49.850 --> 01:55:49.860 align:start position:0%
how would all this work it would be
 
01:55:52.189 --> 01:55:52.199 align:start position:0%
irrelevant I am not aware of a single
 
01:55:54.590 --> 01:55:54.600 align:start position:0%
elected fire chief in the state of New
 
01:55:58.129 --> 01:55:58.139 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that qualifies as a full-time
 
01:55:59.870 --> 01:55:59.880 align:start position:0%
group to
 
01:56:02.870 --> 01:56:02.880 align:start position:0%
employee those those positions are are
 
01:56:05.390 --> 01:56:05.400 align:start position:0%
appointed by the by you know they're
 
01:56:07.310 --> 01:56:07.320 align:start position:0%
hired as a regular employee by towns and
 
01:56:10.129 --> 01:56:10.139 align:start position:0%
cities thank you okay
 
01:56:12.649 --> 01:56:12.659 align:start position:0%
I have an additional what else
 
01:56:15.709 --> 01:56:15.719 align:start position:0%
uh isn't looking back to 2020 uh
 
01:56:17.750 --> 01:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
retroactive and their boy
 
01:56:17.760 --> 01:56:21.649 align:start position:0%
retroactive and their boy
unconstitutional

01:56:21.649 --> 01:56:21.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:21.659 --> 01:56:24.609 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:56:24.609 --> 01:56:24.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:27.950 --> 01:56:27.960 align:start position:0%
fine so we
 
01:56:30.649 --> 01:56:30.659 align:start position:0%
yep yes it is madam chair
 
01:56:30.659 --> 01:56:31.970 align:start position:0%
yep yes it is madam chair
um

01:56:31.970 --> 01:56:31.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:34.070 --> 01:56:34.080 align:start position:0%
that was uh that was done as an
 
01:56:36.129 --> 01:56:36.139 align:start position:0%
attention getter
 
01:56:39.350 --> 01:56:39.360 align:start position:0%
fine so we will if we decide to pass
 
01:56:41.330 --> 01:56:41.340 align:start position:0%
anything of this bill we will have to
 
01:56:43.250 --> 01:56:43.260 align:start position:0%
make sure that it's from the effective
 
01:56:45.470 --> 01:56:45.480 align:start position:0%
date of this legislation and it didn't
 
01:56:47.450 --> 01:56:47.460 align:start position:0%
work by the way the the specific town
 
01:56:49.370 --> 01:56:49.380 align:start position:0%
that that is currently involved in this
 
01:56:52.189 --> 01:56:52.199 align:start position:0%
did not uh is not here and did not reach
 
01:56:56.810 --> 01:56:56.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:59.570 --> 01:56:59.580 align:start position:0%
representative true and then Schmidt
 
01:57:01.729 --> 01:57:01.739 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:57:01.739 --> 01:57:05.990 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
so

01:57:05.990 --> 01:57:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:08.450 --> 01:57:08.460 align:start position:0%
is this bill saying that
 
01:57:12.050 --> 01:57:12.060 align:start position:0%
a town ought not to
 
01:57:12.060 --> 01:57:14.089 align:start position:0%
a town ought not to
reduce

01:57:14.089 --> 01:57:14.099 align:start position:0%
reduce
 
01:57:17.570 --> 01:57:17.580 align:start position:0%
their fire or police force
 
01:57:19.609 --> 01:57:19.619 align:start position:0%
what it is saying is that if you choose
 
01:57:22.970 --> 01:57:22.980 align:start position:0%
to do so you still have to pay the debt
 
01:57:25.330 --> 01:57:25.340 align:start position:0%
on the positions to which you created
 
01:57:28.070 --> 01:57:28.080 align:start position:0%
the debt
 
01:57:31.129 --> 01:57:31.139 align:start position:0%
so it a police department could could
 
01:57:33.770 --> 01:57:33.780 align:start position:0%
eliminate half its positions
 
01:57:36.649 --> 01:57:36.659 align:start position:0%
we're not telling a community a city or
 
01:57:38.450 --> 01:57:38.460 align:start position:0%
town to what size they should have
 
01:57:40.550 --> 01:57:40.560 align:start position:0%
anything but what we're saying is that
 
01:57:42.890 --> 01:57:42.900 align:start position:0%
if for you had a police department of 20
 
01:57:45.470 --> 01:57:45.480 align:start position:0%
and you choose to go down to 10 you
 
01:57:47.149 --> 01:57:47.159 align:start position:0%
still have 10 positions of debt that you
 
01:57:48.770 --> 01:57:48.780 align:start position:0%
are responsible for
 
01:57:51.950 --> 01:57:51.960 align:start position:0%
that we are that you cannot transfer to
 
01:57:53.570 --> 01:57:53.580 align:start position:0%
a different community
 
01:57:58.010 --> 01:57:58.020 align:start position:0%
that that is what that says thank you
 
01:58:01.850 --> 01:58:01.860 align:start position:0%
personally better than like us
 
01:58:03.950 --> 01:58:03.960 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair representative
 
01:58:07.550 --> 01:58:07.560 align:start position:0%
Pearson could you explain why that
 
01:58:10.189 --> 01:58:10.199 align:start position:0%
situation that representative true just
 
01:58:12.950 --> 01:58:12.960 align:start position:0%
asked about would be detrimental to the
 
01:58:15.370 --> 01:58:15.380 align:start position:0%
retirement system well simply enough if
 
01:58:18.950 --> 01:58:18.960 align:start position:0%
to use round numbers let's say that that
 
01:58:20.689 --> 01:58:20.699 align:start position:0%
the retirement system figures out that
 
01:58:22.550 --> 01:58:22.560 align:start position:0%
each one of those positions encompasses
 
01:58:25.850 --> 01:58:25.860 align:start position:0%
a hundred thousand dollars of debt
 
01:58:29.750 --> 01:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
if you were to eliminate five positions
 
01:58:31.970 --> 01:58:31.980 align:start position:0%
that's half a million dollars well that
 
01:58:33.470 --> 01:58:33.480 align:start position:0%
half a million dollars is still debt
 
01:58:35.330 --> 01:58:35.340 align:start position:0%
it's still part of the unfunded
 
01:58:38.209 --> 01:58:38.219 align:start position:0%
liability calc you know calculation so
 
01:58:39.709 --> 01:58:39.719 align:start position:0%
that half a million dollars now has to
 
01:58:41.510 --> 01:58:41.520 align:start position:0%
be paid instead of being paid by Sandown
 
01:58:43.310 --> 01:58:43.320 align:start position:0%
it's now paid by Dairy and epsom and
 
01:58:43.320 --> 01:58:44.330 align:start position:0%
it's now paid by Dairy and epsom and
Hudson

01:58:44.330 --> 01:58:44.340 align:start position:0%
Hudson
 
01:58:47.810 --> 01:58:47.820 align:start position:0%
so what we do not want to get into here
 
01:58:51.530 --> 01:58:51.540 align:start position:0%
is a is a the use of a loophole to
 
01:58:53.510 --> 01:58:53.520 align:start position:0%
transfer a community's debt onto another
 
01:58:53.520 --> 01:58:54.589 align:start position:0%
transfer a community's debt onto another
community

01:58:54.589 --> 01:58:54.599 align:start position:0%
community
 
01:58:57.229 --> 01:58:57.239 align:start position:0%
and this would prevent that from
 
01:58:57.239 --> 01:58:59.330 align:start position:0%
and this would prevent that from
happening

01:58:59.330 --> 01:58:59.340 align:start position:0%
happening
 
01:59:01.850 --> 01:59:01.860 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative
 
01:59:04.310 --> 01:59:04.320 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair representative
 
01:59:06.050 --> 01:59:06.060 align:start position:0%
Pearson I was just curious what the
 
01:59:09.709 --> 01:59:09.719 align:start position:0%
compelling uh part of this was like did
 
01:59:11.810 --> 01:59:11.820 align:start position:0%
it come to your attention did you get a
 
01:59:13.729 --> 01:59:13.739 align:start position:0%
phone call did you were you did you
 
01:59:15.709 --> 01:59:15.719 align:start position:0%
become aware of it and then started
 
01:59:16.790 --> 01:59:16.800 align:start position:0%
looking into it it was like oh that's
 
01:59:19.490 --> 01:59:19.500 align:start position:0%
one town that's two towns so
 
01:59:19.500 --> 01:59:23.810 align:start position:0%
one town that's two towns so
the

01:59:23.810 --> 01:59:23.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:26.450 --> 01:59:26.460 align:start position:0%
the first the first instance of this I
 
01:59:28.129 --> 01:59:28.139 align:start position:0%
became aware of simply because I knew
 
01:59:30.410 --> 01:59:30.420 align:start position:0%
the person who was involved
 
01:59:33.470 --> 01:59:33.480 align:start position:0%
um who is a great guy this is nothing
 
01:59:35.629 --> 01:59:35.639 align:start position:0%
against I won't even name him it's not
 
01:59:37.550 --> 01:59:37.560 align:start position:0%
against him personally
 
01:59:37.560 --> 01:59:39.649 align:start position:0%
against him personally
and

01:59:39.649 --> 01:59:39.659 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:59:41.149 --> 01:59:41.159 align:start position:0%
um and that seemed like kind of a
 
01:59:43.270 --> 01:59:43.280 align:start position:0%
one-off event until
 
01:59:46.310 --> 01:59:46.320 align:start position:0%
what the town of Hooksett did
 
01:59:48.649 --> 01:59:48.659 align:start position:0%
um for whatever reason they chose to do
 
01:59:51.830 --> 01:59:51.840 align:start position:0%
that that's a that's up to them but
 
01:59:54.470 --> 01:59:54.480 align:start position:0%
that was not I don't believe in any way
 
01:59:55.910 --> 01:59:55.920 align:start position:0%
that that was the town of hooksett's
 
01:59:55.920 --> 01:59:57.589 align:start position:0%
that that was the town of hooksett's
intent

01:59:57.589 --> 01:59:57.599 align:start position:0%
intent
 
01:59:58.850 --> 01:59:58.860 align:start position:0%
at all
 
02:00:00.770 --> 02:00:00.780 align:start position:0%
it was to
 
02:00:02.689 --> 02:00:02.699 align:start position:0%
um was to either transfer dead or get
 
02:00:04.129 --> 02:00:04.139 align:start position:0%
out of paying
 
02:00:05.990 --> 02:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
that part of it I
 
02:00:07.729 --> 02:00:07.739 align:start position:0%
I'm not gonna
 
02:00:09.589 --> 02:00:09.599 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to say that that was was
 
02:00:11.629 --> 02:00:11.639 align:start position:0%
their intent at all
 
02:00:13.370 --> 02:00:13.380 align:start position:0%
um the current intent is a little bit
 
02:00:14.810 --> 02:00:14.820 align:start position:0%
more clear
 
02:00:16.070 --> 02:00:16.080 align:start position:0%
with that because they brought the same
 
02:00:20.089 --> 02:00:20.099 align:start position:0%
person back so that really involves two
 
02:00:21.770 --> 02:00:21.780 align:start position:0%
things that we typically don't like to
 
02:00:23.390 --> 02:00:23.400 align:start position:0%
see which is double dipping and debt
 
02:00:23.400 --> 02:00:24.410 align:start position:0%
see which is double dipping and debt
transfer

02:00:24.410 --> 02:00:24.420 align:start position:0%
transfer
 
02:00:26.750 --> 02:00:26.760 align:start position:0%
so that's it's one of those things where
 
02:00:28.669 --> 02:00:28.679 align:start position:0%
I think that if we don't if we don't
 
02:00:30.709 --> 02:00:30.719 align:start position:0%
quench this flame pun intended here now
 
02:00:33.229 --> 02:00:33.239 align:start position:0%
this has the potential to become a a
 
02:00:36.350 --> 02:00:36.360 align:start position:0%
bigger problem later and as
 
02:00:38.990 --> 02:00:39.000 align:start position:0%
chairman McGuire so elegantly pointed
 
02:00:41.689 --> 02:00:41.699 align:start position:0%
out once they do it I can't go backwards
 
02:00:42.950 --> 02:00:42.960 align:start position:0%
and undo it
 
02:00:45.830 --> 02:00:45.840 align:start position:0%
so we have we've got to stop this now
 
02:00:48.649 --> 02:00:48.659 align:start position:0%
before this becomes
 
02:00:50.990 --> 02:00:51.000 align:start position:0%
practice absolutely thank you
 
02:00:55.250 --> 02:00:55.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:55.260 --> 02:00:56.629 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:00:56.629 --> 02:00:56.639 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:00:58.729 --> 02:00:58.739 align:start position:0%
let's see if I'm correct you're saying
 
02:01:00.589 --> 02:01:00.599 align:start position:0%
it's it's not just a situation this
 
02:01:02.089 --> 02:01:02.099 align:start position:0%
won't just apply
 
02:01:04.490 --> 02:01:04.500 align:start position:0%
if you turn a full-time position into a
 
02:01:05.930 --> 02:01:05.940 align:start position:0%
part-time position if you eliminate the
 
02:01:08.089 --> 02:01:08.099 align:start position:0%
position altogether either way either
 
02:01:12.890 --> 02:01:12.900 align:start position:0%
way okay follow up follow up so
 
02:01:15.530 --> 02:01:15.540 align:start position:0%
if you have expanded a department and
 
02:01:17.089 --> 02:01:17.099 align:start position:0%
you've done it for a few years you
 
02:01:18.890 --> 02:01:18.900 align:start position:0%
decide you don't need it you cut it back
 
02:01:18.900 --> 02:01:20.330 align:start position:0%
decide you don't need it you cut it back
down

02:01:20.330 --> 02:01:20.340 align:start position:0%
down
 
02:01:22.729 --> 02:01:22.739 align:start position:0%
then you're the town or the employer
 
02:01:25.189 --> 02:01:25.199 align:start position:0%
will be on the hook as if that had been
 
02:01:27.229 --> 02:01:27.239 align:start position:0%
an employee and they'd accumulated this
 
02:01:29.030 --> 02:01:29.040 align:start position:0%
debt over a long period of time when
 
02:01:32.870 --> 02:01:32.880 align:start position:0%
really that's not true that so
 
02:01:32.880 --> 02:01:34.669 align:start position:0%
really that's not true that so
that

02:01:34.669 --> 02:01:34.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:01:39.250 --> 02:01:39.260 align:start position:0%
procedure process and Analysis is is not
 
02:01:41.750 --> 02:01:41.760 align:start position:0%
addressed here because the retirement
 
02:01:45.229 --> 02:01:45.239 align:start position:0%
system will calculate that that the
 
02:01:47.930 --> 02:01:47.940 align:start position:0%
process of that will be on them to
 
02:01:55.609 --> 02:01:55.619 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:57.589 --> 02:01:57.599 align:start position:0%
um okay so it's they're not just going
 
02:02:00.770 --> 02:02:00.780 align:start position:0%
to continue paying the same UI you know
 
02:02:02.750 --> 02:02:02.760 align:start position:0%
the payment towards ual as if it was
 
02:02:06.530 --> 02:02:06.540 align:start position:0%
still a an employee it would be uh some
 
02:02:07.910 --> 02:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
different amount it would take into
 
02:02:10.010 --> 02:02:10.020 align:start position:0%
account things like how long the
 
02:02:11.510 --> 02:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
position has been there that's why
 
02:02:13.189 --> 02:02:13.199 align:start position:0%
that's why it says
 
02:02:15.169 --> 02:02:15.179 align:start position:0%
um analysis for the retirement system as
 
02:02:17.930 --> 02:02:17.940 align:start position:0%
to the unfunded liability for that
 
02:02:26.390 --> 02:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:28.129 --> 02:02:28.139 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
02:02:31.910 --> 02:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
so uh you may recall I believe you're on
 
02:02:34.070 --> 02:02:34.080 align:start position:0%
the committee at the time we had a bill
 
02:02:37.370 --> 02:02:37.380 align:start position:0%
a couple years ago that would have you
 
02:02:39.709 --> 02:02:39.719 align:start position:0%
know removed a certain Community I think
 
02:02:42.109 --> 02:02:42.119 align:start position:0%
from the retirement system and this
 
02:02:44.570 --> 02:02:44.580 align:start position:0%
whole subject came up at that time that
 
02:02:48.050 --> 02:02:48.060 align:start position:0%
in in so doing you're you're walking
 
02:02:50.149 --> 02:02:50.159 align:start position:0%
away from all your commitments
 
02:02:53.149 --> 02:02:53.159 align:start position:0%
in an attempt to you know to reduce the
 
02:02:57.530 --> 02:02:57.540 align:start position:0%
cost of your talent employees but
 
02:03:00.830 --> 02:03:00.840 align:start position:0%
um the the bottom line is that this this
 
02:03:04.790 --> 02:03:04.800 align:start position:0%
is we we have this idea when we
 
02:03:07.609 --> 02:03:07.619 align:start position:0%
give an employee or employee group a
 
02:03:07.619 --> 02:03:08.870 align:start position:0%
give an employee or employee group a
cola

02:03:08.870 --> 02:03:08.880 align:start position:0%
cola
 
02:03:11.089 --> 02:03:11.099 align:start position:0%
has to be terminally funded that's why
 
02:03:13.310 --> 02:03:13.320 align:start position:0%
it's so much more expensive than just a
 
02:03:16.850 --> 02:03:16.860 align:start position:0%
single uh you know say an extra 13th
 
02:03:18.589 --> 02:03:18.599 align:start position:0%
month check
 
02:03:21.830 --> 02:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
um and so forth so this is it do you
 
02:03:24.649 --> 02:03:24.659 align:start position:0%
think that there that the town is very
 
02:03:26.770 --> 02:03:26.780 align:start position:0%
often doing it ignorantly of the
 
02:03:30.890 --> 02:03:30.900 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:32.870 --> 02:03:32.880 align:start position:0%
it would be difficult like I said before
 
02:03:34.669 --> 02:03:34.679 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't really know what the the
 
02:03:37.850 --> 02:03:37.860 align:start position:0%
overall intent was I'm not gonna I know
 
02:03:39.649 --> 02:03:39.659 align:start position:0%
you're not ascribing that I'm not
 
02:03:41.510 --> 02:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
ascribing that at all and I but but yes
 
02:03:43.250 --> 02:03:43.260 align:start position:0%
I you know I think communities focus on
 
02:03:44.689 --> 02:03:44.699 align:start position:0%
what's going on in front of them and not
 
02:03:47.390 --> 02:03:47.400 align:start position:0%
necessarily the state you know the the
 
02:03:49.189 --> 02:03:49.199 align:start position:0%
health and wellness of the state pension
 
02:03:51.649 --> 02:03:51.659 align:start position:0%
system that's pretty much our job
 
02:03:53.390 --> 02:03:53.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:03:55.609 --> 02:03:55.619 align:start position:0%
representative Gerhart thank you madam
 
02:03:55.619 --> 02:03:56.750 align:start position:0%
representative Gerhart thank you madam
chair

02:03:56.750 --> 02:03:56.760 align:start position:0%
chair
 
02:03:58.609 --> 02:03:58.619 align:start position:0%
to be
 
02:04:00.290 --> 02:04:00.300 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking about demographic Trends
 
02:04:02.030 --> 02:04:02.040 align:start position:0%
just people move out of different areas
 
02:04:04.310 --> 02:04:04.320 align:start position:0%
Go in different areas as far as schools
 
02:04:06.890 --> 02:04:06.900 align:start position:0%
closing if we were to apply this across
 
02:04:10.250 --> 02:04:10.260 align:start position:0%
the board what would happen then
 
02:04:11.390 --> 02:04:11.400 align:start position:0%
well it would depend on what they do
 
02:04:13.910 --> 02:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
with their staff because you know
 
02:04:16.850 --> 02:04:16.860 align:start position:0%
there's but again even even in the I'll
 
02:04:18.350 --> 02:04:18.360 align:start position:0%
give a great example the town of dairy
 
02:04:20.930 --> 02:04:20.940 align:start position:0%
we've had a reduction in student in our
 
02:04:23.689 --> 02:04:23.699 align:start position:0%
student population since 1996.
 
02:04:26.390 --> 02:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
we are substantially lower than we were
 
02:04:27.470 --> 02:04:27.480 align:start position:0%
back then
 
02:04:27.480 --> 02:04:29.209 align:start position:0%
back then
but

02:04:29.209 --> 02:04:29.219 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:04:31.430 --> 02:04:31.440 align:start position:0%
and we're not this wouldn't apply to
 
02:04:33.470 --> 02:04:33.480 align:start position:0%
folks back then because this is going to
 
02:04:36.470 --> 02:04:36.480 align:start position:0%
take effect whenever it's passed 60 days
 
02:04:40.490 --> 02:04:40.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:42.290 --> 02:04:42.300 align:start position:0%
over the over the time period where
 
02:04:44.089 --> 02:04:44.099 align:start position:0%
these positions exist
 
02:04:46.310 --> 02:04:46.320 align:start position:0%
there was debt that a pension debt that
 
02:04:48.770 --> 02:04:48.780 align:start position:0%
occurred so
 
02:04:51.290 --> 02:04:51.300 align:start position:0%
it's not fair for my town to or my
 
02:04:54.290 --> 02:04:54.300 align:start position:0%
school district to walk away excuse me
 
02:04:56.330 --> 02:04:56.340 align:start position:0%
from that debt
 
02:04:58.189 --> 02:04:58.199 align:start position:0%
simply because they just you know we had
 
02:04:59.450 --> 02:04:59.460 align:start position:0%
a lower student enrollment population
 
02:05:01.310 --> 02:05:01.320 align:start position:0%
and we kind of scaled things down
 
02:05:03.950 --> 02:05:03.960 align:start position:0%
because the debts never really walked
 
02:05:06.229 --> 02:05:06.239 align:start position:0%
away from it's just transferred to some
 
02:05:07.669 --> 02:05:07.679 align:start position:0%
other community
 
02:05:07.679 --> 02:05:09.290 align:start position:0%
other community
so

02:05:09.290 --> 02:05:09.300 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:05:12.169 --> 02:05:12.179 align:start position:0%
that is exactly a circumstance that
 
02:05:14.149 --> 02:05:14.159 align:start position:0%
would be legitimate in this case that
 
02:05:16.250 --> 02:05:16.260 align:start position:0%
that's the part of the point of this but
 
02:05:17.570 --> 02:05:17.580 align:start position:0%
we're not gonna we're not telling a
 
02:05:18.950 --> 02:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
school district that can't reduce their
 
02:05:20.930 --> 02:05:20.940 align:start position:0%
staff we're just saying that the debt
 
02:05:22.430 --> 02:05:22.440 align:start position:0%
that they occurred over that time period
 
02:05:25.729 --> 02:05:25.739 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:27.890 --> 02:05:27.900 align:start position:0%
except that every school department in
 
02:05:30.109 --> 02:05:30.119 align:start position:0%
the state is facing a reduced student
 
02:05:30.119 --> 02:05:31.430 align:start position:0%
the state is facing a reduced student
population

02:05:31.430 --> 02:05:31.440 align:start position:0%
population
 
02:05:34.669 --> 02:05:34.679 align:start position:0%
so that may be a very difficult thing to
 
02:05:36.950 --> 02:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
implement representative Simon yeah that
 
02:05:38.810 --> 02:05:38.820 align:start position:0%
might hit towards my question as I'm
 
02:05:40.129 --> 02:05:40.139 align:start position:0%
just thinking through the ramifications
 
02:05:42.589 --> 02:05:42.599 align:start position:0%
of this so the implication would be that
 
02:05:44.870 --> 02:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
the more employees that there are the
 
02:05:46.729 --> 02:05:46.739 align:start position:0%
less each employee's portion of the
 
02:05:49.070 --> 02:05:49.080 align:start position:0%
unfunded liability is correct so you're
 
02:05:50.810 --> 02:05:50.820 align:start position:0%
trying to keep people from reducing the
 
02:05:52.790 --> 02:05:52.800 align:start position:0%
number of employees they have no not at
 
02:05:54.649 --> 02:05:54.659 align:start position:0%
all okay there's nothing in here that
 
02:05:58.790 --> 02:05:58.800 align:start position:0%
that prohibits or prevents or says you
 
02:06:00.169 --> 02:06:00.179 align:start position:0%
know don't do don't reduce your
 
02:06:02.689 --> 02:06:02.699 align:start position:0%
employees you absolutely can but just
 
02:06:04.310 --> 02:06:04.320 align:start position:0%
keep in mind you have responsibilities
 
02:06:06.830 --> 02:06:06.840 align:start position:0%
for the employee that you had follow up
 
02:06:06.840 --> 02:06:08.089 align:start position:0%
for the employee that you had follow up
sorry

02:06:08.089 --> 02:06:08.099 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
02:06:10.129 --> 02:06:10.139 align:start position:0%
um clarifying
 
02:06:11.510 --> 02:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
that came across the wrong way I guess
 
02:06:13.729 --> 02:06:13.739 align:start position:0%
what I'm saying is the more employees in
 
02:06:16.550 --> 02:06:16.560 align:start position:0%
the system the more diluted the
 
02:06:19.550 --> 02:06:19.560 align:start position:0%
responsibility to the uaal is for each
 
02:06:23.689 --> 02:06:23.699 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:25.189 --> 02:06:25.199 align:start position:0%
we have a hundred thousand people as
 
02:06:27.050 --> 02:06:27.060 align:start position:0%
opposed to 200 000 people is the
 
02:06:28.729 --> 02:06:28.739 align:start position:0%
responsibility for each individual
 
02:06:30.830 --> 02:06:30.840 align:start position:0%
person as far as the uaal is concerned
 
02:06:33.229 --> 02:06:33.239 align:start position:0%
less if there are two hundred thousand I
 
02:06:35.570 --> 02:06:35.580 align:start position:0%
suppose I don't I don't think so I don't
 
02:06:38.689 --> 02:06:38.699 align:start position:0%
think it is because the you know each
 
02:06:41.570 --> 02:06:41.580 align:start position:0%
individual employee
 
02:06:45.430 --> 02:06:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:50.510 --> 02:06:50.520 align:start position:0%
actually the the story is that the uaal
 
02:06:52.430 --> 02:06:52.440 align:start position:0%
was incurred
 
02:06:56.030 --> 02:06:56.040 align:start position:0%
from the 90s to about 07 and it's a
 
02:06:59.209 --> 02:06:59.219 align:start position:0%
fixed amount and it just a current
 
02:07:01.310 --> 02:07:01.320 align:start position:0%
employee should not be incurring any
 
02:07:03.649 --> 02:07:03.659 align:start position:0%
additional uaal
 
02:07:05.169 --> 02:07:05.179 align:start position:0%
sure if you were to hire someone today
 
02:07:08.570 --> 02:07:08.580 align:start position:0%
right that they're being fully paid for
 
02:07:11.089 --> 02:07:11.099 align:start position:0%
so if you in essence if you created a
 
02:07:13.250 --> 02:07:13.260 align:start position:0%
position in 20
 
02:07:17.450 --> 02:07:17.460 align:start position:0%
20 in eliminated in 2025 the the effect
 
02:07:20.149 --> 02:07:20.159 align:start position:0%
of this would probably be zero
 
02:07:21.950 --> 02:07:21.960 align:start position:0%
so follow up
 
02:07:25.729 --> 02:07:25.739 align:start position:0%
so in essence then when the nhrs is
 
02:07:27.530 --> 02:07:27.540 align:start position:0%
going back to determine whether or not a
 
02:07:29.810 --> 02:07:29.820 align:start position:0%
position is
 
02:07:29.820 --> 02:07:30.649 align:start position:0%
position is
um

02:07:30.649 --> 02:07:30.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:33.530 --> 02:07:33.540 align:start position:0%
incurring liability and would need to
 
02:07:36.470 --> 02:07:36.480 align:start position:0%
pay this they're looking back toward to
 
02:07:38.990 --> 02:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
what that town had for employees at the
 
02:07:41.750 --> 02:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
time that the uaal was first instituted
 
02:07:43.550 --> 02:07:43.560 align:start position:0%
good question
 
02:07:46.729 --> 02:07:46.739 align:start position:0%
and that's a process that would be a
 
02:07:49.550 --> 02:07:49.560 align:start position:0%
a process question for them because like
 
02:07:51.709 --> 02:07:51.719 align:start position:0%
I said the the rules to which this will
 
02:07:54.950 --> 02:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
be implemented under would be set by the
 
02:07:57.109 --> 02:07:57.119 align:start position:0%
retirement system the intent here I
 
02:07:59.510 --> 02:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
think is pretty clear so it's it's just
 
02:08:01.669 --> 02:08:01.679 align:start position:0%
their application of that
 
02:08:03.830 --> 02:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
so that's a question from Marty Ethan it
 
02:08:05.570 --> 02:08:05.580 align:start position:0%
would very much be a question for Marty
 
02:08:05.580 --> 02:08:08.350 align:start position:0%
would very much be a question for Marty
yeah

02:08:08.350 --> 02:08:08.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:13.669 --> 02:08:13.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:15.830 --> 02:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
from representative Pearson thank you
 
02:08:17.450 --> 02:08:17.460 align:start position:0%
very much thank you madam chair Mr
 
02:08:20.149 --> 02:08:20.159 align:start position:0%
Carlin you've had a uh a warning of the
 
02:08:20.159 --> 02:08:28.669 align:start position:0%
Carlin you've had a uh a warning of the
questions

02:08:28.669 --> 02:08:28.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:30.950 --> 02:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
uh thank you again Madam chair for the
 
02:08:32.930 --> 02:08:32.940 align:start position:0%
record Marty Carlin representing the New
 
02:08:34.970 --> 02:08:34.980 align:start position:0%
Hampshire retirement system uh the
 
02:08:37.010 --> 02:08:37.020 align:start position:0%
retirement system has no position on
 
02:08:38.330 --> 02:08:38.340 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:08:40.609 --> 02:08:40.619 align:start position:0%
um I can I can speak in general terms
 
02:08:44.149 --> 02:08:44.159 align:start position:0%
about how we read the provision
 
02:08:45.470 --> 02:08:45.480 align:start position:0%
um you know in that day that'll answer
 
02:08:48.109 --> 02:08:48.119 align:start position:0%
some of the questions uh people had but
 
02:08:51.350 --> 02:08:51.360 align:start position:0%
you know addressing the bill as drafted
 
02:08:53.530 --> 02:08:53.540 align:start position:0%
it speaks to group two positions so
 
02:08:57.050 --> 02:08:57.060 align:start position:0%
essentially and it's it if it passed it
 
02:08:58.790 --> 02:08:58.800 align:start position:0%
would sort of lock in the number of
 
02:09:01.790 --> 02:09:01.800 align:start position:0%
group two positions for all Employers in
 
02:09:03.530 --> 02:09:03.540 align:start position:0%
the state they can add to that number
 
02:09:05.330 --> 02:09:05.340 align:start position:0%
but if it goes below
 
02:09:07.550 --> 02:09:07.560 align:start position:0%
you know this or positions are
 
02:09:09.530 --> 02:09:09.540 align:start position:0%
eliminated you know there would be the
 
02:09:11.810 --> 02:09:11.820 align:start position:0%
the assessment penalty would would kick
 
02:09:11.820 --> 02:09:12.950 align:start position:0%
the assessment penalty would would kick
in

02:09:12.950 --> 02:09:12.960 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:09:14.089 --> 02:09:14.099 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
02:09:15.830 --> 02:09:15.840 align:start position:0%
um representative Simon was talking
 
02:09:17.990 --> 02:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
about individual liabilities for you
 
02:09:19.669 --> 02:09:19.679 align:start position:0%
know for particular employers and things
 
02:09:22.490 --> 02:09:22.500 align:start position:0%
like that and our employer rates are
 
02:09:24.950 --> 02:09:24.960 align:start position:0%
calculated to spread you know the
 
02:09:26.570 --> 02:09:26.580 align:start position:0%
liability you know that's the same rate
 
02:09:28.430 --> 02:09:28.440 align:start position:0%
you know whether you're in in you know
 
02:09:29.990 --> 02:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
little Tanner Amherst or you know
 
02:09:31.970 --> 02:09:31.980 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth you know the police and fire
 
02:09:34.010 --> 02:09:34.020 align:start position:0%
rates are the same you know and it's
 
02:09:35.810 --> 02:09:35.820 align:start position:0%
it's it's assessed as a percentage of
 
02:09:37.850 --> 02:09:37.860 align:start position:0%
the payroll so you know the higher
 
02:09:39.709 --> 02:09:39.719 align:start position:0%
salary you know the more contributions
 
02:09:40.870 --> 02:09:40.880 align:start position:0%
come in
 
02:09:43.729 --> 02:09:43.739 align:start position:0%
the bill right on its face you know just
 
02:09:46.850 --> 02:09:46.860 align:start position:0%
says you know it we would get salary
 
02:09:48.770 --> 02:09:48.780 align:start position:0%
information for that position for the
 
02:09:51.290 --> 02:09:51.300 align:start position:0%
previous five years whatever
 
02:09:53.149 --> 02:09:53.159 align:start position:0%
um you know five you know whatever that
 
02:09:55.129 --> 02:09:55.139 align:start position:0%
the highest one is we would assess the
 
02:09:58.189 --> 02:09:58.199 align:start position:0%
current employer rate plus 20 percent
 
02:09:59.990 --> 02:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
um so right now the group two uh
 
02:10:02.870 --> 02:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
employer rates are about 31 percent
 
02:10:02.880 --> 02:10:11.350 align:start position:0%
employer rates are about 31 percent
foreign

02:10:11.350 --> 02:10:11.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:15.050 --> 02:10:15.060 align:start position:0%
so so if you know just just for the sake
 
02:10:16.430 --> 02:10:16.440 align:start position:0%
of round numbers and I don't think you
 
02:10:18.169 --> 02:10:18.179 align:start position:0%
know these are probably higher but it's
 
02:10:19.669 --> 02:10:19.679 align:start position:0%
just easier to conceptualize okay
 
02:10:23.510 --> 02:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
there's a uh you have eliminated a group
 
02:10:26.930 --> 02:10:26.940 align:start position:0%
two position and you're hiring somebody
 
02:10:28.669 --> 02:10:28.679 align:start position:0%
on a part-time basis for a hundred
 
02:10:31.430 --> 02:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars So based on the current
 
02:10:33.950 --> 02:10:33.960 align:start position:0%
you know employer rates I'll just say 30
 
02:10:36.830 --> 02:10:36.840 align:start position:0%
percent presume it's it's fire so 20
 
02:10:39.709 --> 02:10:39.719 align:start position:0%
penalty is 36 percent of pay so you'd be
 
02:10:42.229 --> 02:10:42.239 align:start position:0%
paying you know thirty six thousand
 
02:10:45.050 --> 02:10:45.060 align:start position:0%
dollars a year going forward that was
 
02:10:46.609 --> 02:10:46.619 align:start position:0%
based on the highest salary in the
 
02:10:48.830 --> 02:10:48.840 align:start position:0%
previous five years while the person was
 
02:10:51.709 --> 02:10:51.719 align:start position:0%
uh well the position was a contributing
 
02:10:53.870 --> 02:10:53.880 align:start position:0%
position to the retirement system so it
 
02:10:57.070 --> 02:10:57.080 align:start position:0%
you know if if if we're looking for
 
02:10:59.510 --> 02:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
individual liabilities for specific
 
02:11:01.370 --> 02:11:01.380 align:start position:0%
people it gets a lot more complicated
 
02:11:03.109 --> 02:11:03.119 align:start position:0%
we'd have to have the actual redo those
 
02:11:06.589 --> 02:11:06.599 align:start position:0%
at a cost on on a per person basis we
 
02:11:08.750 --> 02:11:08.760 align:start position:0%
read this is It's a flat
 
02:11:11.689 --> 02:11:11.699 align:start position:0%
you know formula for everybody
 
02:11:14.450 --> 02:11:14.460 align:start position:0%
um you know so you know our just just
 
02:11:16.070 --> 02:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
from a process
 
02:11:17.930 --> 02:11:17.940 align:start position:0%
um concern it says you know the employer
 
02:11:20.390 --> 02:11:20.400 align:start position:0%
shall not eliminate or transfer or
 
02:11:22.250 --> 02:11:22.260 align:start position:0%
position to part-time without an
 
02:11:25.250 --> 02:11:25.260 align:start position:0%
analysis from nhrs but it doesn't spell
 
02:11:26.990 --> 02:11:27.000 align:start position:0%
out you know
 
02:11:28.850 --> 02:11:28.860 align:start position:0%
usually with things like that there's
 
02:11:30.350 --> 02:11:30.360 align:start position:0%
language about you know on a form
 
02:11:31.910 --> 02:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
determined you know by the Board of
 
02:11:34.070 --> 02:11:34.080 align:start position:0%
Trustees or something like that so you
 
02:11:36.050 --> 02:11:36.060 align:start position:0%
know you know and you know that if an
 
02:11:39.169 --> 02:11:39.179 align:start position:0%
employer doesn't do that exercise and
 
02:11:41.089 --> 02:11:41.099 align:start position:0%
eliminates a position and nobody notices
 
02:11:43.010 --> 02:11:43.020 align:start position:0%
it you know we're not gonna
 
02:11:44.750 --> 02:11:44.760 align:start position:0%
find out about it until you know we do
 
02:11:46.370 --> 02:11:46.380 align:start position:0%
an audit you know you know somewhere in
 
02:11:47.750 --> 02:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
the next you know three to seven years
 
02:11:49.729 --> 02:11:49.739 align:start position:0%
with the employer so so there's just
 
02:11:51.709 --> 02:11:51.719 align:start position:0%
some some process pieces I mean if it's
 
02:11:54.850 --> 02:11:54.860 align:start position:0%
as simple as we create a form you know
 
02:11:57.589 --> 02:11:57.599 align:start position:0%
employer downloads it puts the name of
 
02:11:58.790 --> 02:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
the position if they have a number
 
02:12:00.109 --> 02:12:00.119 align:start position:0%
associated with it which we wouldn't
 
02:12:02.450 --> 02:12:02.460 align:start position:0%
have any way to verify they put in the
 
02:12:04.970 --> 02:12:04.980 align:start position:0%
salary information and we just you know
 
02:12:06.410 --> 02:12:06.420 align:start position:0%
find the find the biggest number
 
02:12:08.750 --> 02:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
multiply it by the current percent plus
 
02:12:11.450 --> 02:12:11.460 align:start position:0%
20 and say you need to pay us this
 
02:12:14.149 --> 02:12:14.159 align:start position:0%
amount you know in perpetuity you know
 
02:12:15.830 --> 02:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't be part of the monthly
 
02:12:19.669 --> 02:12:19.679 align:start position:0%
reporting uh for you know members and
 
02:12:21.530 --> 02:12:21.540 align:start position:0%
employers that come in because nobody's
 
02:12:23.870 --> 02:12:23.880 align:start position:0%
accruing a benefit for that essentially
 
02:12:25.310 --> 02:12:25.320 align:start position:0%
any of the
 
02:12:28.129 --> 02:12:28.139 align:start position:0%
money coming in for from the elimination
 
02:12:30.470 --> 02:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
of these positions would be treated as
 
02:12:32.510 --> 02:12:32.520 align:start position:0%
an Actuarial gain so it would all go
 
02:12:35.450 --> 02:12:35.460 align:start position:0%
towards the unfunded liability
 
02:12:37.430 --> 02:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
you know so to the extent if it's a
 
02:12:38.870 --> 02:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
couple of million dollars you know and
 
02:12:40.550 --> 02:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
you know over the over the course of a
 
02:12:42.830 --> 02:12:42.840 align:start position:0%
year that's just coming straight off the
 
02:12:44.510 --> 02:12:44.520 align:start position:0%
ual so the next time the rates are
 
02:12:47.510 --> 02:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
certified they'd be that small but lower
 
02:12:50.270 --> 02:12:50.280 align:start position:0%
so I hope that you know and then there's
 
02:12:52.069 --> 02:12:52.079 align:start position:0%
there's we don't see anything in here
 
02:12:54.169 --> 02:12:54.179 align:start position:0%
where the retirement system would be
 
02:12:56.930 --> 02:12:56.940 align:start position:0%
making any determination on whether it
 
02:12:58.609 --> 02:12:58.619 align:start position:0%
was right or wrong oh you know the
 
02:13:00.229 --> 02:13:00.239 align:start position:0%
population dropped and they got rid of
 
02:13:01.069 --> 02:13:01.079 align:start position:0%
somebody I mean it's pretty
 
02:13:02.450 --> 02:13:02.460 align:start position:0%
straightforward you eliminate a position
 
02:13:04.669 --> 02:13:04.679 align:start position:0%
or you convert it to part-time there's a
 
02:13:08.990 --> 02:13:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:11.390 --> 02:13:11.400 align:start position:0%
you know way to adjudicate you know
 
02:13:13.370 --> 02:13:13.380 align:start position:0%
what what the reasons they did for it it
 
02:13:15.109 --> 02:13:15.119 align:start position:0%
assumes you know that you know you're
 
02:13:17.050 --> 02:13:17.060 align:start position:0%
just paying the liability regardless and
 
02:13:20.629 --> 02:13:20.639 align:start position:0%
honestly if there was some sort of uh
 
02:13:22.850 --> 02:13:22.860 align:start position:0%
set up to look at those I we I don't
 
02:13:23.870 --> 02:13:23.880 align:start position:0%
know if we'd be comfortable making
 
02:13:26.569 --> 02:13:26.579 align:start position:0%
determinations on the merits of you know
 
02:13:29.089 --> 02:13:29.099 align:start position:0%
whether you know Beau should have 27
 
02:13:30.830 --> 02:13:30.840 align:start position:0%
police or 26 you know what I mean it's
 
02:13:32.870 --> 02:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
kind of outside our they agree to make
 
02:13:34.850 --> 02:13:34.860 align:start position:0%
those determinations and you don't have
 
02:13:36.830 --> 02:13:36.840 align:start position:0%
to pay the penalty and you do away you
 
02:13:38.870 --> 02:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
know right now it's a blanket penalty
 
02:13:42.129 --> 02:13:42.139 align:start position:0%
okay in perpetuity yes representative
 
02:13:45.530 --> 02:13:45.540 align:start position:0%
Dolan and then Marcus and paper
 
02:13:48.649 --> 02:13:48.659 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair uh question for
 
02:13:51.950 --> 02:13:51.960 align:start position:0%
you it uh we hear a lot
 
02:13:55.370 --> 02:13:55.380 align:start position:0%
that school enrollments are dropping
 
02:13:55.380 --> 02:13:56.810 align:start position:0%
that school enrollments are dropping
everywhere

02:13:56.810 --> 02:13:56.820 align:start position:0%
everywhere
 
02:13:58.970 --> 02:13:58.980 align:start position:0%
which would seem to suggest we're over
 
02:14:01.490 --> 02:14:01.500 align:start position:0%
staffed with teachers
 
02:14:04.669 --> 02:14:04.679 align:start position:0%
uh we also hear a lot that we can't hire
 
02:14:07.069 --> 02:14:07.079 align:start position:0%
enough First Responders firefighters
 
02:14:10.069 --> 02:14:10.079 align:start position:0%
where many communities of 20 30 below
 
02:14:11.990 --> 02:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
what their open positions are so we're
 
02:14:13.850 --> 02:14:13.860 align:start position:0%
short-handed in that regard
 
02:14:17.149 --> 02:14:17.159 align:start position:0%
so my question is is this bill
 
02:14:21.109 --> 02:14:21.119 align:start position:0%
going to help mitigate some of those
 
02:14:24.109 --> 02:14:24.119 align:start position:0%
uh levels of Staffing that whether
 
02:14:25.970 --> 02:14:25.980 align:start position:0%
they're too high in the terms of
 
02:14:28.010 --> 02:14:28.020 align:start position:0%
teachers are too low in terms of First
 
02:14:32.209 --> 02:14:32.219 align:start position:0%
Responders always neutral I I I'm not
 
02:14:34.729 --> 02:14:34.739 align:start position:0%
even I'm not sure if you know we could
 
02:14:36.649 --> 02:14:36.659 align:start position:0%
and now you know you know even analyze
 
02:14:39.109 --> 02:14:39.119 align:start position:0%
that you know that that question I mean
 
02:14:40.430 --> 02:14:40.440 align:start position:0%
it does
 
02:14:43.010 --> 02:14:43.020 align:start position:0%
you know it to the extent that the
 
02:14:43.020 --> 02:14:45.649 align:start position:0%
you know it to the extent that the
penalty

02:14:45.649 --> 02:14:45.659 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:48.050 --> 02:14:48.060 align:start position:0%
changes Behavior regarding head count it
 
02:14:49.609 --> 02:14:49.619 align:start position:0%
could have some impact but I couldn't
 
02:14:51.050 --> 02:14:51.060 align:start position:0%
say whether you know what what that
 
02:14:53.510 --> 02:14:53.520 align:start position:0%
impact would be you know because if you
 
02:14:54.709 --> 02:14:54.719 align:start position:0%
know when the employer is doing the
 
02:14:56.810 --> 02:14:56.820 align:start position:0%
calculus of how much am I paying the
 
02:14:58.550 --> 02:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
full-time or plus retirement how much of
 
02:15:00.290 --> 02:15:00.300 align:start position:0%
them paying the part-timer plus the
 
02:15:03.169 --> 02:15:03.179 align:start position:0%
penalty you know it and look at the
 
02:15:04.910 --> 02:15:04.920 align:start position:0%
numbers their decision making may be
 
02:15:07.850 --> 02:15:07.860 align:start position:0%
influenced by that so
 
02:15:13.069 --> 02:15:13.079 align:start position:0%
uh so so when I'm wrestling with is does
 
02:15:14.450 --> 02:15:14.460 align:start position:0%
this change
 
02:15:14.460 --> 02:15:15.709 align:start position:0%
this change
help

02:15:15.709 --> 02:15:15.719 align:start position:0%
help
 
02:15:20.709 --> 02:15:20.719 align:start position:0%
or hurt us with regard to the various
 
02:15:24.370 --> 02:15:24.380 align:start position:0%
payrolls that are out there and
 
02:15:27.950 --> 02:15:27.960 align:start position:0%
or is that is that not the intent that
 
02:15:31.129 --> 02:15:31.139 align:start position:0%
that it would help or hurt and or you
 
02:15:33.470 --> 02:15:33.480 align:start position:0%
just want no position well I I think um
 
02:15:35.830 --> 02:15:35.840 align:start position:0%
you know you know representative Pearson
 
02:15:37.850 --> 02:15:37.860 align:start position:0%
referred to this and as a general
 
02:15:40.669 --> 02:15:40.679 align:start position:0%
principle you know the you know the the
 
02:15:42.470 --> 02:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
actuary predicts you know the head count
 
02:15:44.390 --> 02:15:44.400 align:start position:0%
to be relatively stable you know you
 
02:15:46.250 --> 02:15:46.260 align:start position:0%
know for for the member groups we don't
 
02:15:48.350 --> 02:15:48.360 align:start position:0%
expect you know people keep we keep
 
02:15:50.629 --> 02:15:50.639 align:start position:0%
hiring new public employees or that you
 
02:15:52.010 --> 02:15:52.020 align:start position:0%
know there's going to be a you know Mass
 
02:15:53.629 --> 02:15:53.639 align:start position:0%
Exodus of you know you know five
 
02:15:55.250 --> 02:15:55.260 align:start position:0%
thousand fewer and five years than there
 
02:15:56.510 --> 02:15:56.520 align:start position:0%
are now
 
02:15:59.149 --> 02:15:59.159 align:start position:0%
um but um so to the extent that the
 
02:16:01.069 --> 02:16:01.079 align:start position:0%
unfunded liability is assessed on the
 
02:16:02.990 --> 02:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
total payroll of all contributing
 
02:16:05.390 --> 02:16:05.400 align:start position:0%
members if there are fewer contributing
 
02:16:07.870 --> 02:16:07.880 align:start position:0%
members you know that
 
02:16:10.010 --> 02:16:10.020 align:start position:0%
liability is the same amount but it's
 
02:16:12.649 --> 02:16:12.659 align:start position:0%
it's assessed at a higher rate on the
 
02:16:14.569 --> 02:16:14.579 align:start position:0%
remaining employers so sort of
 
02:16:17.149 --> 02:16:17.159 align:start position:0%
collectively if you know you know the
 
02:16:19.310 --> 02:16:19.320 align:start position:0%
you know there was a community that
 
02:16:21.169 --> 02:16:21.179 align:start position:0%
went away from full-time employees
 
02:16:23.149 --> 02:16:23.159 align:start position:0%
entirely you know their liabilities
 
02:16:25.550 --> 02:16:25.560 align:start position:0%
didn't wouldn't go away but they all the
 
02:16:26.810 --> 02:16:26.820 align:start position:0%
other employers will be paying a
 
02:16:28.370 --> 02:16:28.380 align:start position:0%
fraction of them because they don't have
 
02:16:30.169 --> 02:16:30.179 align:start position:0%
any covered payroll on which to assess
 
02:16:33.530 --> 02:16:33.540 align:start position:0%
it so you know it it's kind of a
 
02:16:35.750 --> 02:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
complicated answer I hope it helped
 
02:16:39.770 --> 02:16:39.780 align:start position:0%
but yes and I and many of employers in
 
02:16:42.049 --> 02:16:42.059 align:start position:0%
the state have noticed that they're
 
02:16:44.270 --> 02:16:44.280 align:start position:0%
paying a lot to the retirement system
 
02:16:46.969 --> 02:16:46.979 align:start position:0%
for their employees and they are making
 
02:16:49.790 --> 02:16:49.800 align:start position:0%
decisions based on
 
02:16:52.490 --> 02:16:52.500 align:start position:0%
how they can not do so
 
02:16:54.770 --> 02:16:54.780 align:start position:0%
so they hire part-time people or
 
02:16:54.780 --> 02:16:55.790 align:start position:0%
so they hire part-time people or
whatever

02:16:55.790 --> 02:16:55.800 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
02:17:00.230 --> 02:17:00.240 align:start position:0%
representative leckis thank you um so
 
02:17:02.770 --> 02:17:02.780 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson gave an example
 
02:17:05.450 --> 02:17:05.460 align:start position:0%
saying that if someone were a position
 
02:17:08.570 --> 02:17:08.580 align:start position:0%
were open in 2020 and then they decided
 
02:17:09.889 --> 02:17:09.899 align:start position:0%
they didn't need any more and close it
 
02:17:13.009 --> 02:17:13.019 align:start position:0%
in 2025 that his assumption how the
 
02:17:14.450 --> 02:17:14.460 align:start position:0%
retirement system would handle it would
 
02:17:17.509 --> 02:17:17.519 align:start position:0%
be that because they weren't employed
 
02:17:20.270 --> 02:17:20.280 align:start position:0%
during the time the uaal was you know
 
02:17:21.349 --> 02:17:21.359 align:start position:0%
about the
 
02:17:22.849 --> 02:17:22.859 align:start position:0%
what's going with you the problem was
 
02:17:25.009 --> 02:17:25.019 align:start position:0%
going on that
 
02:17:27.110 --> 02:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
um this would result in them
 
02:17:28.910 --> 02:17:28.920 align:start position:0%
in the town and the employer not paying
 
02:17:31.370 --> 02:17:31.380 align:start position:0%
anything from what you said recently
 
02:17:32.870 --> 02:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
though it seems to me that that's not
 
02:17:34.129 --> 02:17:34.139 align:start position:0%
the case
 
02:17:36.290 --> 02:17:36.300 align:start position:0%
so with which is a
 
02:17:39.290 --> 02:17:39.300 align:start position:0%
because if you know if if you know the
 
02:17:42.889 --> 02:17:42.899 align:start position:0%
town's payroll was three million dollars
 
02:17:45.169 --> 02:17:45.179 align:start position:0%
and they eliminated position so the
 
02:17:46.790 --> 02:17:46.800 align:start position:0%
payroll was only you know two million
 
02:17:48.889 --> 02:17:48.899 align:start position:0%
dollars you know this you know they
 
02:17:50.509 --> 02:17:50.519 align:start position:0%
would be paying the employer rate you
 
02:17:52.490 --> 02:17:52.500 align:start position:0%
know as as calculated but they'd be
 
02:17:54.410 --> 02:17:54.420 align:start position:0%
paying it on a smaller payroll base so
 
02:17:54.420 --> 02:17:55.429 align:start position:0%
paying it on a smaller payroll base so
that

02:17:55.429 --> 02:17:55.439 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:17:57.589 --> 02:17:57.599 align:start position:0%
additional contributions you know would
 
02:17:57.599 --> 02:17:59.410 align:start position:0%
additional contributions you know would
be

02:17:59.410 --> 02:17:59.420 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:18:02.209 --> 02:18:02.219 align:start position:0%
essentially sort of spread out among all
 
02:18:04.490 --> 02:18:04.500 align:start position:0%
the participating employers so you know
 
02:18:06.169 --> 02:18:06.179 align:start position:0%
and and you know if you're talking you
 
02:18:07.969 --> 02:18:07.979 align:start position:0%
know one position two positions I mean
 
02:18:09.770 --> 02:18:09.780 align:start position:0%
it's in the rounding you know in terms
 
02:18:11.750 --> 02:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
of how much more each you know
 
02:18:13.969 --> 02:18:13.979 align:start position:0%
individual employer is going to pay but
 
02:18:16.910 --> 02:18:16.920 align:start position:0%
it does you know
 
02:18:18.830 --> 02:18:18.840 align:start position:0%
you know spread that out among everyone
 
02:18:20.570 --> 02:18:20.580 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:18:20.580 --> 02:18:22.310 align:start position:0%
you know
follow-up

02:18:22.310 --> 02:18:22.320 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
02:18:24.469 --> 02:18:24.479 align:start position:0%
yeah that's not really
 
02:18:27.290 --> 02:18:27.300 align:start position:0%
maybe it's answering an indirect way but
 
02:18:29.330 --> 02:18:29.340 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned about the particular case
 
02:18:31.610 --> 02:18:31.620 align:start position:0%
where an employee was hired not during
 
02:18:33.410 --> 02:18:33.420 align:start position:0%
the period that the wrong you know an
 
02:18:35.150 --> 02:18:35.160 align:start position:0%
inadequate amount of money must be put
 
02:18:35.160 --> 02:18:36.230 align:start position:0%
inadequate amount of money must be put
in

02:18:36.230 --> 02:18:36.240 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:18:38.570 --> 02:18:38.580 align:start position:0%
and then the positions eliminated so
 
02:18:41.509 --> 02:18:41.519 align:start position:0%
that the employer has not accrued in my
 
02:18:44.089 --> 02:18:44.099 align:start position:0%
view any debt whatsoever and they
 
02:18:45.889 --> 02:18:45.899 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have to be paying any of this
 
02:18:47.990 --> 02:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
so when I heard that from represent
 
02:18:49.490 --> 02:18:49.500 align:start position:0%
Pearson it made me feel a lot better
 
02:18:51.650 --> 02:18:51.660 align:start position:0%
about this bill but from what you're
 
02:18:53.450 --> 02:18:53.460 align:start position:0%
saying that's not the case they're still
 
02:18:55.429 --> 02:18:55.439 align:start position:0%
going to
 
02:18:55.439 --> 02:18:56.030 align:start position:0%
going to
um

02:18:56.030 --> 02:18:56.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:58.310 --> 02:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
you know they'll still have to pay based
 
02:18:59.750 --> 02:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
on the you know the highest the last
 
02:19:02.690 --> 02:19:02.700 align:start position:0%
five years for that employee even even
 
02:19:05.270 --> 02:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
if the position didn't exist during the
 
02:19:07.070 --> 02:19:07.080 align:start position:0%
earlier period is that correct
 
02:19:10.070 --> 02:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
yes in the sense that the employer rates
 
02:19:12.770 --> 02:19:12.780 align:start position:0%
are the same for all members regardless
 
02:19:14.750 --> 02:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
of when they entered the system so the
 
02:19:16.849 --> 02:19:16.859 align:start position:0%
person who's been here 25 years and
 
02:19:18.230 --> 02:19:18.240 align:start position:0%
perhaps in their first half of their
 
02:19:19.730 --> 02:19:19.740 align:start position:0%
career because of
 
02:19:21.709 --> 02:19:21.719 align:start position:0%
related issues there was an unfunded
 
02:19:23.870 --> 02:19:23.880 align:start position:0%
liability Associated we weren't
 
02:19:25.549 --> 02:19:25.559 align:start position:0%
collecting the contributions correctly
 
02:19:27.469 --> 02:19:27.479 align:start position:0%
you know in somebody who started last
 
02:19:29.690 --> 02:19:29.700 align:start position:0%
month still 30 percent of pay for both
 
02:19:31.490 --> 02:19:31.500 align:start position:0%
of them
 
02:19:33.889 --> 02:19:33.899 align:start position:0%
one last follow-up if I could one last
 
02:19:36.530 --> 02:19:36.540 align:start position:0%
follow-up so to have it work the way
 
02:19:40.009 --> 02:19:40.019 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson said
 
02:19:41.870 --> 02:19:41.880 align:start position:0%
um I mean could you suggest any language
 
02:19:43.429 --> 02:19:43.439 align:start position:0%
you don't have to answer right now but
 
02:19:45.169 --> 02:19:45.179 align:start position:0%
that would actually make that happen
 
02:19:47.810 --> 02:19:47.820 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:19:50.510 --> 02:19:50.520 align:start position:0%
it would be extremely complicated to
 
02:19:53.389 --> 02:19:53.399 align:start position:0%
calculate that based on the service of
 
02:19:55.910 --> 02:19:55.920 align:start position:0%
the individuals in the position and if
 
02:19:57.770 --> 02:19:57.780 align:start position:0%
if it was somebody switched positions in
 
02:20:00.530 --> 02:20:00.540 align:start position:0%
mid course and it gets even and more
 
02:20:02.270 --> 02:20:02.280 align:start position:0%
complicated uh you know so I'm not sure
 
02:20:04.429 --> 02:20:04.439 align:start position:0%
if there's a solution to that to your
 
02:20:04.439 --> 02:20:05.750 align:start position:0%
if there's a solution to that to your
concern

02:20:05.750 --> 02:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
concern
 
02:20:08.870 --> 02:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
02:20:11.630 --> 02:20:11.640 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair Marty would you
 
02:20:11.640 --> 02:20:12.889 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair Marty would you
mind

02:20:12.889 --> 02:20:12.899 align:start position:0%
mind
 
02:20:14.929 --> 02:20:14.939 align:start position:0%
drafting up a cheat sheet for me just
 
02:20:16.130 --> 02:20:16.140 align:start position:0%
like you did
 
02:20:18.730 --> 02:20:18.740 align:start position:0%
with 436
 
02:20:21.410 --> 02:20:21.420 align:start position:0%
just sort of a hypothetical here's at
 
02:20:23.570 --> 02:20:23.580 align:start position:0%
this employer rate you know this is what
 
02:20:25.130 --> 02:20:25.140 align:start position:0%
it would cost the town that's an easy
 
02:20:26.389 --> 02:20:26.399 align:start position:0%
one yeah
 
02:20:28.130 --> 02:20:28.140 align:start position:0%
okay easier than 4 30. well if you're
 
02:20:30.730 --> 02:20:30.740 align:start position:0%
not executing it today I can do it if uh
 
02:20:32.870 --> 02:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
this will be going to the pension
 
02:20:36.110 --> 02:20:36.120 align:start position:0%
subcommittee thank you because it's
 
02:20:38.210 --> 02:20:38.220 align:start position:0%
clearly more complicated than it looked
 
02:20:39.950 --> 02:20:39.960 align:start position:0%
at first reading
 
02:20:42.110 --> 02:20:42.120 align:start position:0%
uh are there any other questions from Mr
 
02:20:44.809 --> 02:20:44.819 align:start position:0%
Carl representative Simon uh thank you
 
02:20:46.490 --> 02:20:46.500 align:start position:0%
madam chair yeah so the representative
 
02:20:47.929 --> 02:20:47.939 align:start position:0%
Lake assist questions we're getting back
 
02:20:49.969 --> 02:20:49.979 align:start position:0%
to the one that I had initially asked
 
02:20:52.849 --> 02:20:52.859 align:start position:0%
obviously without the uaal rates are
 
02:20:54.710 --> 02:20:54.720 align:start position:0%
just equal across the board and people
 
02:20:56.929 --> 02:20:56.939 align:start position:0%
pay in and you run the actuary on it but
 
02:20:59.330 --> 02:20:59.340 align:start position:0%
the uaal is getting spread out among all
 
02:21:01.610 --> 02:21:01.620 align:start position:0%
present employees so as the employee
 
02:21:04.070 --> 02:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
pool drops the share for each
 
02:21:06.889 --> 02:21:06.899 align:start position:0%
contributing member goes up which is the
 
02:21:08.809 --> 02:21:08.819 align:start position:0%
concern right
 
02:21:11.330 --> 02:21:11.340 align:start position:0%
so technically
 
02:21:15.230 --> 02:21:15.240 align:start position:0%
as the pool goes down the liability for
 
02:21:17.389 --> 02:21:17.399 align:start position:0%
the next person to get get out goes up
 
02:21:20.090 --> 02:21:20.100 align:start position:0%
the expense to that person would be more
 
02:21:21.530 --> 02:21:21.540 align:start position:0%
expensive than the person who got out
 
02:21:23.809 --> 02:21:23.819 align:start position:0%
previously my concern with this is that
 
02:21:26.330 --> 02:21:26.340 align:start position:0%
it is like there's an incentive to get
 
02:21:28.429 --> 02:21:28.439 align:start position:0%
out sooner because the later you get out
 
02:21:29.870 --> 02:21:29.880 align:start position:0%
so if you're at a school system for
 
02:21:32.090 --> 02:21:32.100 align:start position:0%
example and you're looking to
 
02:21:32.100 --> 02:21:32.630 align:start position:0%
example and you're looking to
um

02:21:32.630 --> 02:21:32.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:21:34.250 --> 02:21:34.260 align:start position:0%
you're looking to downsize because your
 
02:21:35.929 --> 02:21:35.939 align:start position:0%
student population is going down and you
 
02:21:37.969 --> 02:21:37.979 align:start position:0%
need to lay off teachers and your
 
02:21:39.650 --> 02:21:39.660 align:start position:0%
liability according to this bill is
 
02:21:41.510 --> 02:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
going to get go up the more other
 
02:21:43.550 --> 02:21:43.560 align:start position:0%
schools beat you to the punch you may
 
02:21:45.610 --> 02:21:45.620 align:start position:0%
want to get out sooner rather than later
 
02:21:47.750 --> 02:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
potentially it's just
 
02:21:50.750 --> 02:21:50.760 align:start position:0%
would that would that be accurate
 
02:21:52.670 --> 02:21:52.680 align:start position:0%
you know it um
 
02:21:54.889 --> 02:21:54.899 align:start position:0%
when you talk about you know getting
 
02:21:57.770 --> 02:21:57.780 align:start position:0%
beat to the punch I mean the the this uh
 
02:21:59.630 --> 02:21:59.640 align:start position:0%
penalty as it's structured you know the
 
02:22:02.210 --> 02:22:02.220 align:start position:0%
the employer would still be paying money
 
02:22:04.370 --> 02:22:04.380 align:start position:0%
to nhrs it wouldn't be I don't think it
 
02:22:05.750 --> 02:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
would be technically considered employer
 
02:22:07.490 --> 02:22:07.500 align:start position:0%
contributions anymore because it's not
 
02:22:09.530 --> 02:22:09.540 align:start position:0%
going to board's funding benefits for
 
02:22:11.809 --> 02:22:11.819 align:start position:0%
anyone it's it's additional money over
 
02:22:14.090 --> 02:22:14.100 align:start position:0%
and above you know what's coming in from
 
02:22:15.469 --> 02:22:15.479 align:start position:0%
Member and employee contributions
 
02:22:19.070 --> 02:22:19.080 align:start position:0%
already so to that extent you know the
 
02:22:20.929 --> 02:22:20.939 align:start position:0%
two years later when we set the new
 
02:22:22.610 --> 02:22:22.620 align:start position:0%
rates whatever
 
02:22:25.010 --> 02:22:25.020 align:start position:0%
whatever Revenue was generated through
 
02:22:27.950 --> 02:22:27.960 align:start position:0%
these penalties that would just come off
 
02:22:31.730 --> 02:22:31.740 align:start position:0%
the uaal you know shave off you know a
 
02:22:35.090 --> 02:22:35.100 align:start position:0%
point or something so it would it would
 
02:22:35.100 --> 02:22:36.410 align:start position:0%
point or something so it would it would
um

02:22:36.410 --> 02:22:36.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:40.190 --> 02:22:40.200 align:start position:0%
it it has the potential to lower the ual
 
02:22:42.590 --> 02:22:42.600 align:start position:0%
rate for all the participating member
 
02:22:44.630 --> 02:22:44.640 align:start position:0%
employers and members paying in because
 
02:22:45.889 --> 02:22:45.899 align:start position:0%
because you're getting money that you
 
02:22:48.590 --> 02:22:48.600 align:start position:0%
weren't anticipating sooner you know so
 
02:22:51.290 --> 02:22:51.300 align:start position:0%
so um you know but it's it's you know
 
02:22:53.389 --> 02:22:53.399 align:start position:0%
don't think of it you know I mean it's I
 
02:22:55.070 --> 02:22:55.080 align:start position:0%
don't know it's more complicated yeah no
 
02:22:57.230 --> 02:22:57.240 align:start position:0%
it's more of a balancing act part of
 
02:22:58.670 --> 02:22:58.680 align:start position:0%
it's going to drop part of it's going to
 
02:23:01.250 --> 02:23:01.260 align:start position:0%
go up what outpaces what yeah so so the
 
02:23:03.050 --> 02:23:03.060 align:start position:0%
incentives you know you know as I
 
02:23:04.730 --> 02:23:04.740 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier is you know is it
 
02:23:06.710 --> 02:23:06.720 align:start position:0%
worth it to eliminate this position or
 
02:23:08.090 --> 02:23:08.100 align:start position:0%
turn it to part-time because we're going
 
02:23:10.070 --> 02:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
to end up paying just as much you know
 
02:23:12.410 --> 02:23:12.420 align:start position:0%
that way and that's that's a you know a
 
02:23:14.570 --> 02:23:14.580 align:start position:0%
local decision and there's really no
 
02:23:16.370 --> 02:23:16.380 align:start position:0%
right or wrong answer it depends on the
 
02:23:17.870 --> 02:23:17.880 align:start position:0%
circumstances the facts of the
 
02:23:20.389 --> 02:23:20.399 align:start position:0%
particular position thank you for the
 
02:23:22.070 --> 02:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
clarification appreciate it any other
 
02:23:25.190 --> 02:23:25.200 align:start position:0%
questions represent true
 
02:23:27.710 --> 02:23:27.720 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
02:23:29.450 --> 02:23:29.460 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
02:23:31.670 --> 02:23:31.680 align:start position:0%
um so in the in the position of in the
 
02:23:34.790 --> 02:23:34.800 align:start position:0%
situation where a fire chief
 
02:23:38.990 --> 02:23:39.000 align:start position:0%
is a decertified or he's old enough so
 
02:23:42.110 --> 02:23:42.120 align:start position:0%
he just retires
 
02:23:44.630 --> 02:23:44.640 align:start position:0%
and they don't refill that position they
 
02:23:47.510 --> 02:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
bring him back or somebody back
 
02:23:51.650 --> 02:23:51.660 align:start position:0%
uh uh is part-time is does that create a
 
02:23:51.660 --> 02:23:53.510 align:start position:0%
uh uh is part-time is does that create a
debt

02:23:53.510 --> 02:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
debt
 
02:23:55.910 --> 02:23:55.920 align:start position:0%
what was the position that the retiree
 
02:23:57.590 --> 02:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
is filling was it ever a contributing
 
02:23:59.510 --> 02:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
position to the retirement system was
 
02:24:01.490 --> 02:24:01.500 align:start position:0%
there a prior full-timer so he he was a
 
02:24:04.270 --> 02:24:04.280 align:start position:0%
full-time fire chief at 25 years he
 
02:24:07.130 --> 02:24:07.140 align:start position:0%
retires yeah they don't hire another
 
02:24:07.140 --> 02:24:08.630 align:start position:0%
retires yeah they don't hire another
full-time

02:24:08.630 --> 02:24:08.640 align:start position:0%
full-time
 
02:24:11.750 --> 02:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
they bring him or someone back
 
02:24:13.969 --> 02:24:13.979 align:start position:0%
time well if the guy retired but he was
 
02:24:16.070 --> 02:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
eligible for retirement is there a
 
02:24:18.830 --> 02:24:18.840 align:start position:0%
continuing debt even though he's retired
 
02:24:21.050 --> 02:24:21.060 align:start position:0%
it you know collectively you know you
 
02:24:22.790 --> 02:24:22.800 align:start position:0%
know it we don't calculate to the
 
02:24:24.290 --> 02:24:24.300 align:start position:0%
individual level but collectively
 
02:24:27.550 --> 02:24:27.560 align:start position:0%
there's an unfunded liability so the
 
02:24:29.750 --> 02:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
contributions coming in on that position
 
02:24:32.450 --> 02:24:32.460 align:start position:0%
when it was full-time aren't coming in
 
02:24:34.130 --> 02:24:34.140 align:start position:0%
anymore so that's that's the difference
 
02:24:36.230 --> 02:24:36.240 align:start position:0%
that that's that's the the part that
 
02:24:38.510 --> 02:24:38.520 align:start position:0%
gets spread out among everyone else
 
02:24:42.230 --> 02:24:42.240 align:start position:0%
thank you yes okay anyone else
 
02:24:45.230 --> 02:24:45.240 align:start position:0%
thank you very much is there anyone else
 
02:24:49.910 --> 02:24:49.920 align:start position:0%

03:30:26.450 --> 03:30:26.460 align:start position:0%
and for committee uh reference
 
03:30:28.910 --> 03:30:28.920 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to be scheduling anything
 
03:30:31.729 --> 03:30:31.739 align:start position:0%
for the next two weeks except
 
03:30:31.739 --> 03:30:33.290 align:start position:0%
for the next two weeks except
subcommittees

03:30:33.290 --> 03:30:33.300 align:start position:0%
subcommittees
 
03:30:35.990 --> 03:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
are free to meet that's
 
03:30:40.790 --> 03:30:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:40.800 --> 03:30:44.030 align:start position:0%
 
rejoicing

03:30:44.030 --> 03:30:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:46.550 --> 03:30:46.560 align:start position:0%
well you know some of you might have a
 
03:30:48.650 --> 03:30:48.660 align:start position:0%
life that you'd like to uh
 
03:30:52.910 --> 03:30:52.920 align:start position:0%
do something with it at that time
 
03:30:52.920 --> 03:30:56.389 align:start position:0%
do something with it at that time
okay

03:30:56.389 --> 03:30:56.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:59.809 --> 03:30:59.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:59.819 --> 03:31:01.070 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:31:01.070 --> 03:31:01.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:31:03.170 --> 03:31:03.180 align:start position:0%
I'll spill
 
03:31:06.650 --> 03:31:06.660 align:start position:0%
436 went to the pension committee
 
03:31:08.389 --> 03:31:08.399 align:start position:0%
representative Simon
 
03:31:11.150 --> 03:31:11.160 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair the um
 
03:31:14.030 --> 03:31:14.040 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee uh has agreed and so I
 
03:31:15.849 --> 03:31:15.859 align:start position:0%
am putting forward
 
03:31:22.670 --> 03:31:22.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:26.870 --> 03:31:26.880 align:start position:0%
for consideration for the committee
 
03:31:28.910 --> 03:31:28.920 align:start position:0%
is there a second
 
03:31:28.920 --> 03:31:30.170 align:start position:0%
is there a second
second

03:31:30.170 --> 03:31:30.180 align:start position:0%
second
 
03:31:30.180 --> 03:31:31.910 align:start position:0%
second
okay

03:31:31.910 --> 03:31:31.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:31:34.790 --> 03:31:34.800 align:start position:0%
Simon and Schmidt do you wish I presume
 
03:31:36.050 --> 03:31:36.060 align:start position:0%
you wish to speak to your mind yeah
 
03:31:38.750 --> 03:31:38.760 align:start position:0%
probably a good idea
 
03:31:40.670 --> 03:31:40.680 align:start position:0%
um so the amendment uh completely
 
03:31:42.889 --> 03:31:42.899 align:start position:0%
overhauls the original bill it deals
 
03:31:45.710 --> 03:31:45.720 align:start position:0%
with members of uh group two of the New
 
03:31:47.210 --> 03:31:47.220 align:start position:0%
Hampshire retirement system that had
 
03:31:48.769 --> 03:31:48.779 align:start position:0%
begun service but had not yet been
 
03:31:52.070 --> 03:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
vested by 2011 when the calculation of
 
03:31:53.690 --> 03:31:53.700 align:start position:0%
benefits um
 
03:31:55.770 --> 03:31:55.780 align:start position:0%
changed in statute
 
03:31:55.780 --> 03:31:56.450 align:start position:0%
changed in statute
[Music]

03:31:56.450 --> 03:31:56.460 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:31:56.460 --> 03:31:57.050 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

03:31:57.050 --> 03:31:57.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:31:59.170 --> 03:31:59.180 align:start position:0%
the amendment does a few things
 
03:32:01.550 --> 03:32:01.560 align:start position:0%
the first thing that it does if you're
 
03:32:03.170 --> 03:32:03.180 align:start position:0%
looking on page one of the amendment
 
03:32:05.210 --> 03:32:05.220 align:start position:0%
it's quite a long Amendment but first
 
03:32:08.690 --> 03:32:08.700 align:start position:0%
first page line five through seven
 
03:32:10.370 --> 03:32:10.380 align:start position:0%
um it does two things in this area the
 
03:32:12.290 --> 03:32:12.300 align:start position:0%
first thing it does is it it defines the
 
03:32:15.050 --> 03:32:15.060 align:start position:0%
word vested to mean a member has
 
03:32:16.670 --> 03:32:16.680 align:start position:0%
qualified benefit upon 10 years of
 
03:32:18.710 --> 03:32:18.720 align:start position:0%
service this has always been the assumed
 
03:32:21.889 --> 03:32:21.899 align:start position:0%
condition in New Hampshire the New
 
03:32:23.330 --> 03:32:23.340 align:start position:0%
Hampshire retirement system does all of
 
03:32:27.050 --> 03:32:27.060 align:start position:0%
its actualizing based off of that idea
 
03:32:28.429 --> 03:32:28.439 align:start position:0%
but it was never in statute so we're
 
03:32:30.050 --> 03:32:30.060 align:start position:0%
simply putting it in statute so it's on
 
03:32:33.889 --> 03:32:33.899 align:start position:0%
the books the second part of it states
 
03:32:36.170 --> 03:32:36.180 align:start position:0%
that calculations for earnable
 
03:32:39.670 --> 03:32:39.680 align:start position:0%
compensation so what Avenues of Revenue
 
03:32:42.889 --> 03:32:42.899 align:start position:0%
an employee can make goes towards their
 
03:32:45.650 --> 03:32:45.660 align:start position:0%
final compensation and also the average
 
03:32:47.809 --> 03:32:47.819 align:start position:0%
final compensation itself on which their
 
03:32:50.990 --> 03:32:51.000 align:start position:0%
benefits are determined cannot be
 
03:32:52.670 --> 03:32:52.680 align:start position:0%
reduced after three years of service so
 
03:32:54.290 --> 03:32:54.300 align:start position:0%
once a member of group two has put in
 
03:32:55.969 --> 03:32:55.979 align:start position:0%
three years of service those two
 
03:32:58.130 --> 03:32:58.140 align:start position:0%
components with no longer be allowed to
 
03:33:00.849 --> 03:33:00.859 align:start position:0%
be adjusted
 
03:33:04.849 --> 03:33:04.859 align:start position:0%
doesn't that apply to every every person
 
03:33:07.070 --> 03:33:07.080 align:start position:0%
not just group two
 
03:33:09.290 --> 03:33:09.300 align:start position:0%
that is correct no you are correct it
 
03:33:10.790 --> 03:33:10.800 align:start position:0%
applies to both group one and one name
 
03:33:12.830 --> 03:33:12.840 align:start position:0%
yes it does apply to a group on a group
 
03:33:13.849 --> 03:33:13.859 align:start position:0%
two thank you for that clarification
 
03:33:13.859 --> 03:33:15.950 align:start position:0%
two thank you for that clarification
clarification

03:33:15.950 --> 03:33:15.960 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
03:33:18.889 --> 03:33:18.899 align:start position:0%
um so that's the two changes there
 
03:33:22.429 --> 03:33:22.439 align:start position:0%
um if you change if you move on to page
 
03:33:22.439 --> 03:33:25.910 align:start position:0%
um if you change if you move on to page
eight

03:33:25.910 --> 03:33:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:28.250 --> 03:33:28.260 align:start position:0%
of the amendments
 
03:33:30.950 --> 03:33:30.960 align:start position:0%
um lines
 
03:33:30.960 --> 03:33:32.510 align:start position:0%
um lines
20

03:33:32.510 --> 03:33:32.520 align:start position:0%
20
 
03:33:35.050 --> 03:33:35.060 align:start position:0%
through 25
 
03:33:38.210 --> 03:33:38.220 align:start position:0%
it also changes
 
03:33:40.969 --> 03:33:40.979 align:start position:0%
um the provision that the final benefit
 
03:33:44.210 --> 03:33:44.220 align:start position:0%
would be calculated on 85 percent of the
 
03:33:46.010 --> 03:33:46.020 align:start position:0%
members average final compensation
 
03:33:48.710 --> 03:33:48.720 align:start position:0%
changes it to a hundred percent and it
 
03:33:50.690 --> 03:33:50.700 align:start position:0%
also increases
 
03:33:52.550 --> 03:33:52.560 align:start position:0%
um the cap for the compensation which
 
03:33:56.809 --> 03:33:56.819 align:start position:0%
was at 120 000 to 125 000 with an annual
 
03:33:59.690 --> 03:33:59.700 align:start position:0%
increase of 1.25 percent
 
03:34:02.990 --> 03:34:03.000 align:start position:0%
um each year thereafter that is a
 
03:34:04.790 --> 03:34:04.800 align:start position:0%
basically been put in there to account
 
03:34:07.070 --> 03:34:07.080 align:start position:0%
for a small amount of inflation so that
 
03:34:11.210 --> 03:34:11.220 align:start position:0%
the cap doesn't stagnate in its amount
 
03:34:14.330 --> 03:34:14.340 align:start position:0%
um yes
 
03:34:16.309 --> 03:34:16.319 align:start position:0%
are those the Amendments yes those are
 
03:34:17.690 --> 03:34:17.700 align:start position:0%
the copies of the amendment just not
 
03:34:19.790 --> 03:34:19.800 align:start position:0%
every everybody doesn't have them
 
03:34:22.910 --> 03:34:22.920 align:start position:0%
okay if anybody needs one
 
03:34:24.290 --> 03:34:24.300 align:start position:0%
does anybody need a copy of the
 
03:34:24.300 --> 03:34:30.769 align:start position:0%
does anybody need a copy of the
amendment

03:34:30.769 --> 03:34:30.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:32.269 --> 03:34:32.279 align:start position:0%
it's slightly older but it's close
 
03:34:34.849 --> 03:34:34.859 align:start position:0%
enough there's no major structural
 
03:34:49.130 --> 03:34:49.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:49.140 --> 03:34:51.469 align:start position:0%
 
again

03:34:51.469 --> 03:34:51.479 align:start position:0%
again
 
03:34:52.729 --> 03:34:52.739 align:start position:0%
all right the next thing that the bill
 
03:34:52.739 --> 03:34:53.690 align:start position:0%
all right the next thing that the bill
does

03:34:53.690 --> 03:34:53.700 align:start position:0%
does
 
03:34:57.010 --> 03:34:57.020 align:start position:0%
um is it adjusts the calculation table
 
03:35:00.050 --> 03:35:00.060 align:start position:0%
for members who had begun service but
 
03:35:03.290 --> 03:35:03.300 align:start position:0%
had not yet been vested by 2011 there is
 
03:35:07.130 --> 03:35:07.140 align:start position:0%
a chart on page seven I believe
 
03:35:09.170 --> 03:35:09.180 align:start position:0%
that outlines
 
03:35:11.630 --> 03:35:11.640 align:start position:0%
um the change in the
 
03:35:15.170 --> 03:35:15.180 align:start position:0%
contribution calculations are
 
03:35:16.790 --> 03:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
not the contribution calculations but
 
03:35:17.809 --> 03:35:17.819 align:start position:0%
the actual
 
03:35:17.819 --> 03:35:18.349 align:start position:0%
the actual
um

03:35:18.349 --> 03:35:18.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:35:18.359 --> 03:35:22.250 align:start position:0%
um
final

03:35:22.250 --> 03:35:22.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:23.929 --> 03:35:23.939 align:start position:0%
I don't know the word's gone
 
03:35:25.190 --> 03:35:25.200 align:start position:0%
um they're fine yes it's how they
 
03:35:28.250 --> 03:35:28.260 align:start position:0%
calculate their final benefit
 
03:35:30.050 --> 03:35:30.060 align:start position:0%
um and the bill will take on a year by
 
03:35:33.050 --> 03:35:33.060 align:start position:0%
year basis each line
 
03:35:33.060 --> 03:35:33.889 align:start position:0%
year basis each line
um

03:35:33.889 --> 03:35:33.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:35:36.590 --> 03:35:36.600 align:start position:0%
of years of service at the time of this
 
03:35:38.929 --> 03:35:38.939 align:start position:0%
change and it will repeal one year at a
 
03:35:38.939 --> 03:35:39.950 align:start position:0%
change and it will repeal one year at a
time

03:35:39.950 --> 03:35:39.960 align:start position:0%
time
 
03:35:43.030 --> 03:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
um placing the members in that group
 
03:35:46.429 --> 03:35:46.439 align:start position:0%
from the new contribution system to the
 
03:35:47.870 --> 03:35:47.880 align:start position:0%
old contribution system and essentially
 
03:35:50.690 --> 03:35:50.700 align:start position:0%
put them back in the contribution system
 
03:35:52.610 --> 03:35:52.620 align:start position:0%
that was in place when they were hired
 
03:35:56.150 --> 03:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
originally the bill amends itself nine
 
03:35:59.630 --> 03:35:59.640 align:start position:0%
times each year a new group is a new
 
03:36:01.370 --> 03:36:01.380 align:start position:0%
line of this chart is repealed and a new
 
03:36:03.370 --> 03:36:03.380 align:start position:0%
group is moved back into the previous
 
03:36:05.210 --> 03:36:05.220 align:start position:0%
benefits that they were offered when
 
03:36:07.130 --> 03:36:07.140 align:start position:0%
they were first hired or at least were
 
03:36:09.910 --> 03:36:09.920 align:start position:0%
on the books when they were first hired
 
03:36:13.269 --> 03:36:13.279 align:start position:0%
the last thing that it does is
 
03:36:15.889 --> 03:36:15.899 align:start position:0%
it terminally funds it through the
 
03:36:18.170 --> 03:36:18.180 align:start position:0%
general fund of the of the
 
03:36:20.150 --> 03:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
General Court
 
03:36:24.849 --> 03:36:24.859 align:start position:0%
this is on page 11 line 28
 
03:36:29.269 --> 03:36:29.279 align:start position:0%
the amendment allocates 25 million per
 
03:36:31.190 --> 03:36:31.200 align:start position:0%
year for a 10-year period to terminally
 
03:36:33.710 --> 03:36:33.720 align:start position:0%
fund our estimates for this are already
 
03:36:35.389 --> 03:36:35.399 align:start position:0%
lower than that
 
03:36:38.210 --> 03:36:38.220 align:start position:0%
um and and they come in significantly
 
03:36:38.220 --> 03:36:39.410 align:start position:0%
um and and they come in significantly
lower

03:36:39.410 --> 03:36:39.420 align:start position:0%
lower
 
03:36:43.309 --> 03:36:43.319 align:start position:0%
um than the than the 250 if this is left
 
03:36:47.990 --> 03:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
as is any money that isn't used to fund
 
03:36:48.000 --> 03:36:49.090 align:start position:0%
as is any money that isn't used to fund
this

03:36:49.090 --> 03:36:49.100 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:36:52.550 --> 03:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
would then be sent down to the
 
03:36:56.570 --> 03:36:56.580 align:start position:0%
municipalities to reduce their rates
 
03:36:58.550 --> 03:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
that was what that's how Marty explained
 
03:37:01.490 --> 03:37:01.500 align:start position:0%
to me well what if there is any if all
 
03:37:03.050 --> 03:37:03.060 align:start position:0%
of the money given to the retirement
 
03:37:05.269 --> 03:37:05.279 align:start position:0%
system is not needed to fund this
 
03:37:07.790 --> 03:37:07.800 align:start position:0%
benefit it will be used to reduce the
 
03:37:10.910 --> 03:37:10.920 align:start position:0%
uaal which will affect the calculations
 
03:37:14.210 --> 03:37:14.220 align:start position:0%
that the employers pay okay is that
 
03:37:15.830 --> 03:37:15.840 align:start position:0%
correct okay I'm sorry I misunderstood
 
03:37:18.170 --> 03:37:18.180 align:start position:0%
that from the last subcommittee meeting
 
03:37:19.729 --> 03:37:19.739 align:start position:0%
um of course this is also going to
 
03:37:21.849 --> 03:37:21.859 align:start position:0%
finance so Finance
 
03:37:25.070 --> 03:37:25.080 align:start position:0%
can amend it to more accurately reflect
 
03:37:26.570 --> 03:37:26.580 align:start position:0%
the actual
 
03:37:28.370 --> 03:37:28.380 align:start position:0%
estimate that comes out of the New
 
03:37:29.870 --> 03:37:29.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire retirement system and that
 
03:37:31.250 --> 03:37:31.260 align:start position:0%
would come back to the floor so that we
 
03:37:33.889 --> 03:37:33.899 align:start position:0%
don't have quite a as large a gap
 
03:37:35.990 --> 03:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
between what we're estimating and what
 
03:37:38.269 --> 03:37:38.279 align:start position:0%
we will actually be spending in a
 
03:37:40.490 --> 03:37:40.500 align:start position:0%
nutshell that's the major changes
 
03:37:42.410 --> 03:37:42.420 align:start position:0%
to the ball
 
03:37:45.050 --> 03:37:45.060 align:start position:0%
I'd like to add that the rest of the
 
03:37:48.830 --> 03:37:48.840 align:start position:0%
bill is implementing those changes so
 
03:37:52.250 --> 03:37:52.260 align:start position:0%
it's a lot you can't just say
 
03:37:56.570 --> 03:37:56.580 align:start position:0%
in a one line it for example page on
 
03:38:01.010 --> 03:38:01.020 align:start position:0%
page one what it does is it breaks apart
 
03:38:03.290 --> 03:38:03.300 align:start position:0%
burnable compensation for group one
 
03:38:05.690 --> 03:38:05.700 align:start position:0%
which is unchanged from current statute
 
03:38:08.990 --> 03:38:09.000 align:start position:0%
and earnable conversation for group two
 
03:38:13.670 --> 03:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:15.530 --> 03:38:15.540 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt do you wish to
 
03:38:17.630 --> 03:38:17.640 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion or your second
 
03:38:20.389 --> 03:38:20.399 align:start position:0%
I do Madam chair thank you very much I
 
03:38:24.530 --> 03:38:24.540 align:start position:0%
want to begin and this is not an uh no
 
03:38:28.969 --> 03:38:28.979 align:start position:0%
an attempt to win the chairs vote but to
 
03:38:32.269 --> 03:38:32.279 align:start position:0%
to speak uh the truth as I see it uh
 
03:38:37.370 --> 03:38:37.380 align:start position:0%
that uh chairman Maguire uh it has a a
 
03:38:39.530 --> 03:38:39.540 align:start position:0%
truly formidable understanding of the
 
03:38:42.309 --> 03:38:42.319 align:start position:0%
situation as a result of years of
 
03:38:44.750 --> 03:38:44.760 align:start position:0%
involvement with the retirement system
 
03:38:47.690 --> 03:38:47.700 align:start position:0%
both as the chair of the committee but
 
03:38:50.150 --> 03:38:50.160 align:start position:0%
also as a member of the decennial
 
03:38:53.630 --> 03:38:53.640 align:start position:0%
commission where she was involved with
 
03:38:57.349 --> 03:38:57.359 align:start position:0%
the subject as well and so her
 
03:39:00.830 --> 03:39:00.840 align:start position:0%
understanding of the of the situation is
 
03:39:03.290 --> 03:39:03.300 align:start position:0%
uh is a big asset in terms of making
 
03:39:05.750 --> 03:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
sure that we do the best job that we can
 
03:39:07.790 --> 03:39:07.800 align:start position:0%
under the circumstances and I also want
 
03:39:10.010 --> 03:39:10.020 align:start position:0%
to salute the subcommittee chair who
 
03:39:13.910 --> 03:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
also conducted a very effective review
 
03:39:17.150 --> 03:39:17.160 align:start position:0%
of the situation uh with a lot of
 
03:39:19.510 --> 03:39:19.520 align:start position:0%
involvement of uh
 
03:39:23.030 --> 03:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
representative Stephen Pearson who
 
03:39:25.729 --> 03:39:25.739 align:start position:0%
understands the situation very well
 
03:39:30.650 --> 03:39:30.660 align:start position:0%
um and having sat in 301 303 about uh 10
 
03:39:33.229 --> 03:39:33.239 align:start position:0%
years ago it seems like uh with a room
 
03:39:34.790 --> 03:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
full of of
 
03:39:37.969 --> 03:39:37.979 align:start position:0%
First Responders who were very
 
03:39:41.750 --> 03:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
grim-faced at the prospect of what the
 
03:39:43.670 --> 03:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
retirement system was going to do to
 
03:39:46.429 --> 03:39:46.439 align:start position:0%
them in under the pressure of
 
03:39:49.490 --> 03:39:49.500 align:start position:0%
circumstances and I think a number of
 
03:39:52.450 --> 03:39:52.460 align:start position:0%
things were done that that
 
03:39:55.150 --> 03:39:55.160 align:start position:0%
were not fair
 
03:39:58.690 --> 03:39:58.700 align:start position:0%
and this amendment I believe
 
03:40:03.830 --> 03:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
restores a number of of situations to a
 
03:40:06.190 --> 03:40:06.200 align:start position:0%
much fairer and better situation
 
03:40:10.010 --> 03:40:10.020 align:start position:0%
so I am going to enthusiastically not
 
03:40:12.590 --> 03:40:12.600 align:start position:0%
only second motion ought to pass but
 
03:40:15.530 --> 03:40:15.540 align:start position:0%
also to vote high on measure when it
 
03:40:18.290 --> 03:40:18.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:19.670 --> 03:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
lack of
 
03:40:23.030 --> 03:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
thank you um so I noticed this as I
 
03:40:24.590 --> 03:40:24.600 align:start position:0%
understand at least just deals with
 
03:40:27.469 --> 03:40:27.479 align:start position:0%
group two I'm wondering if I mean I
 
03:40:28.610 --> 03:40:28.620 align:start position:0%
don't know all the details what happened
 
03:40:30.889 --> 03:40:30.899 align:start position:0%
when the changes occurred
 
03:40:33.410 --> 03:40:33.420 align:start position:0%
um does this whole issue not not apply
 
03:40:36.410 --> 03:40:36.420 align:start position:0%
at all to group one it does not apply to
 
03:40:38.950 --> 03:40:38.960 align:start position:0%
group one because
 
03:40:42.889 --> 03:40:42.899 align:start position:0%
wait the only two classes were created
 
03:40:46.269 --> 03:40:46.279 align:start position:0%
group two was sliced into different
 
03:40:49.570 --> 03:40:49.580 align:start position:0%
categories and set for the transition
 
03:40:52.490 --> 03:40:52.500 align:start position:0%
and the difference between the older and
 
03:40:55.550 --> 03:40:55.560 align:start position:0%
the newer employees was more
 
03:40:55.560 --> 03:40:56.269 align:start position:0%
the newer employees was more
um

03:40:56.269 --> 03:40:56.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:40:59.450 --> 03:40:59.460 align:start position:0%
was larger and plus there's more steps
 
03:41:02.269 --> 03:41:02.279 align:start position:0%
in between and that was one of the the
 
03:41:06.050 --> 03:41:06.060 align:start position:0%
issues that this bill is intended to uh
 
03:41:08.750 --> 03:41:08.760 align:start position:0%
um to solve and just to follow up on
 
03:41:10.670 --> 03:41:10.680 align:start position:0%
that in the for group one you said there
 
03:41:12.290 --> 03:41:12.300 align:start position:0%
were two categories so we passed the
 
03:41:19.070 --> 03:41:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:21.469 --> 03:41:21.479 align:start position:0%
no and it
 
03:41:23.090 --> 03:41:23.100 align:start position:0%
okay there
 
03:41:25.729 --> 03:41:25.739 align:start position:0%
not attain vested
 
03:41:25.739 --> 03:41:28.849 align:start position:0%
not attain vested
it's

03:41:28.849 --> 03:41:28.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:30.229 --> 03:41:30.239 align:start position:0%
just wondering if we're going to be
 
03:41:32.389 --> 03:41:32.399 align:start position:0%
faced with coming back and dealing with
 
03:41:35.210 --> 03:41:35.220 align:start position:0%
that aspect there hasn't been as much of
 
03:41:39.110 --> 03:41:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:42.710 --> 03:41:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:45.110 --> 03:41:45.120 align:start position:0%
yes representative shua thank you madam
 
03:41:48.170 --> 03:41:48.180 align:start position:0%
chair I'll just add that um
 
03:41:51.610 --> 03:41:51.620 align:start position:0%
a concern group two more because
 
03:41:55.190 --> 03:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
they they only had to serve a more
 
03:41:58.250 --> 03:41:58.260 align:start position:0%
limited number of years in order to be
 
03:42:00.349 --> 03:42:00.359 align:start position:0%
retired who knows group one obviously
 
03:42:01.610 --> 03:42:01.620 align:start position:0%
had to
 
03:42:04.630 --> 03:42:04.640 align:start position:0%
in order to qualify for a good benefit
 
03:42:08.210 --> 03:42:08.220 align:start position:0%
normally would work probably 30 years or
 
03:42:11.150 --> 03:42:11.160 align:start position:0%
more so it wasn't as concerning when it
 
03:42:14.269 --> 03:42:14.279 align:start position:0%
got changed for some of those folks
 
03:42:14.279 --> 03:42:19.670 align:start position:0%
got changed for some of those folks
foreign

03:42:19.670 --> 03:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:19.680 --> 03:42:23.330 align:start position:0%
 
true

03:42:23.330 --> 03:42:23.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:26.809 --> 03:42:26.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:26.819 --> 03:42:30.170 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:42:30.170 --> 03:42:30.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:33.349 --> 03:42:33.359 align:start position:0%
I voted for this in subcommittee because
 
03:42:36.530 --> 03:42:36.540 align:start position:0%
the amendment in my view is certainly a
 
03:42:39.050 --> 03:42:39.060 align:start position:0%
lot better than the original bill
 
03:42:42.830 --> 03:42:42.840 align:start position:0%
the original Bill involved downshifting
 
03:42:44.809 --> 03:42:44.819 align:start position:0%
to the towns
 
03:42:47.389 --> 03:42:47.399 align:start position:0%
and as it's been said this is terminally
 
03:42:47.399 --> 03:42:49.070 align:start position:0%
and as it's been said this is terminally
funded

03:42:49.070 --> 03:42:49.080 align:start position:0%
funded
 
03:42:50.750 --> 03:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
the the state
 
03:42:52.670 --> 03:42:52.680 align:start position:0%
is going to is going to pick up this
 
03:42:52.680 --> 03:42:55.670 align:start position:0%
is going to is going to pick up this
cost

03:42:55.670 --> 03:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:58.670 --> 03:42:58.680 align:start position:0%
my problem is
 
03:43:02.150 --> 03:43:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:02.160 --> 03:43:03.050 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:43:03.050 --> 03:43:03.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:43:06.650 --> 03:43:06.660 align:start position:0%
200 to 250 we don't we don't really know
 
03:43:06.660 --> 03:43:08.150 align:start position:0%
200 to 250 we don't we don't really know
uh

03:43:08.150 --> 03:43:08.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:43:10.790 --> 03:43:10.800 align:start position:0%
where the what the cost will be but it
 
03:43:13.849 --> 03:43:13.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:17.210 --> 03:43:17.220 align:start position:0%
and I will quote from uh what I speak to
 
03:43:18.590 --> 03:43:18.600 align:start position:0%
as the truth
 
03:43:22.250 --> 03:43:22.260 align:start position:0%
article 10 New Hampshire Constitution
 
03:43:24.650 --> 03:43:24.660 align:start position:0%
government being instituted for the
 
03:43:27.290 --> 03:43:27.300 align:start position:0%
common benefit protection and security
 
03:43:28.910 --> 03:43:28.920 align:start position:0%
of the whole community
 
03:43:30.710 --> 03:43:30.720 align:start position:0%
and not for the private interest
 
03:43:34.670 --> 03:43:34.680 align:start position:0%
interest or emoluments above any one-man
 
03:43:34.680 --> 03:43:35.990 align:start position:0%
interest or emoluments above any one-man
family

03:43:35.990 --> 03:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
family
 
03:43:40.010 --> 03:43:40.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:42.429 --> 03:43:42.439 align:start position:0%
I realized there was a a
 
03:43:45.530 --> 03:43:45.540 align:start position:0%
strong desire to
 
03:43:49.030 --> 03:43:49.040 align:start position:0%
to correct what the
 
03:43:57.650 --> 03:43:57.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:02.050 --> 03:44:02.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:05.570 --> 03:44:05.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:08.570 --> 03:44:08.580 align:start position:0%
math is not my strong point
 
03:44:11.150 --> 03:44:11.160 align:start position:0%
but looking at the community of New
 
03:44:14.210 --> 03:44:14.220 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the people of New Hampshire
 
03:44:16.929 --> 03:44:16.939 align:start position:0%
that's 1731
 
03:44:19.849 --> 03:44:19.859 align:start position:0%
represents zero point
 
03:44:22.070 --> 03:44:22.080 align:start position:0%
zero zero
 
03:44:23.750 --> 03:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
one percent
 
03:44:27.469 --> 03:44:27.479 align:start position:0%
one thousand one one thousandth
 
03:44:29.510 --> 03:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
of one percent
 
03:44:31.610 --> 03:44:31.620 align:start position:0%
of the people in New Hampshire
 
03:44:34.490 --> 03:44:34.500 align:start position:0%
is where this 200 to 250 million dollars
 
03:44:36.469 --> 03:44:36.479 align:start position:0%
is going
 
03:44:38.750 --> 03:44:38.760 align:start position:0%
and because of article 10 I can't
 
03:44:38.760 --> 03:44:39.889 align:start position:0%
and because of article 10 I can't
support

03:44:39.889 --> 03:44:39.899 align:start position:0%
support
 
03:44:42.650 --> 03:44:42.660 align:start position:0%
the bill is amended
 
03:44:45.170 --> 03:44:45.180 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
03:44:47.690 --> 03:44:47.700 align:start position:0%
yes I did some calculations and it's
 
03:44:47.700 --> 03:44:49.670 align:start position:0%
yes I did some calculations and it's
something

03:44:49.670 --> 03:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
something
 
03:44:51.950 --> 03:44:51.960 align:start position:0%
over a hundred thousand dollars per
 
03:44:53.690 --> 03:44:53.700 align:start position:0%
person involved
 
03:44:55.490 --> 03:44:55.500 align:start position:0%
we don't know exactly how much but it's
 
03:44:57.590 --> 03:44:57.600 align:start position:0%
it's going in that range
 
03:45:00.229 --> 03:45:00.239 align:start position:0%
and the
 
03:45:04.010 --> 03:45:04.020 align:start position:0%
the only reason that I'm supporting it
 
03:45:07.130 --> 03:45:07.140 align:start position:0%
is that we are currently paying
 
03:45:09.229 --> 03:45:09.239 align:start position:0%
substantial sums
 
03:45:13.670 --> 03:45:13.680 align:start position:0%
to retain our police and fire and also
 
03:45:16.370 --> 03:45:16.380 align:start position:0%
to recruit new ones
 
03:45:20.090 --> 03:45:20.100 align:start position:0%
if this is a way which of course comes
 
03:45:21.769 --> 03:45:21.779 align:start position:0%
out of your taxes
 
03:45:23.809 --> 03:45:23.819 align:start position:0%
primarily your local taxes because
 
03:45:26.030 --> 03:45:26.040 align:start position:0%
nearly all police and fire are local
 
03:45:28.550 --> 03:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
employees not state employees
 
03:45:28.560 --> 03:45:30.170 align:start position:0%
employees not state employees
so

03:45:30.170 --> 03:45:30.180 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:45:35.570 --> 03:45:35.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:39.349 --> 03:45:39.359 align:start position:0%
a change the retirement system to help
 
03:45:41.750 --> 03:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
solve our Recruitment and Retention
 
03:45:41.760 --> 03:45:45.349 align:start position:0%
solve our Recruitment and Retention
issues

03:45:45.349 --> 03:45:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:48.650 --> 03:45:48.660 align:start position:0%
and we hope that it will do so and
 
03:45:50.630 --> 03:45:50.640 align:start position:0%
thereby save the towns a great deal of
 
03:45:50.640 --> 03:45:51.650 align:start position:0%
thereby save the towns a great deal of
money

03:45:51.650 --> 03:45:51.660 align:start position:0%
money
 
03:45:54.650 --> 03:45:54.660 align:start position:0%
in the future so they won't have to pay
 
03:45:57.830 --> 03:45:57.840 align:start position:0%
hiring bonuses they won't have to deal
 
03:45:57.840 --> 03:45:59.809 align:start position:0%
hiring bonuses they won't have to deal
with

03:45:59.809 --> 03:45:59.819 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:46:02.570 --> 03:46:02.580 align:start position:0%
rapid turnover
 
03:46:05.150 --> 03:46:05.160 align:start position:0%
where they won't have to pay people
 
03:46:07.790 --> 03:46:07.800 align:start position:0%
bonuses to stick stick around for
 
03:46:09.889 --> 03:46:09.899 align:start position:0%
another year or two
 
03:46:09.899 --> 03:46:11.389 align:start position:0%
another year or two
um

03:46:11.389 --> 03:46:11.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:46:14.030 --> 03:46:14.040 align:start position:0%
it's a question everybody has to ask
 
03:46:16.130 --> 03:46:16.140 align:start position:0%
themselves is it worth it
 
03:46:19.490 --> 03:46:19.500 align:start position:0%
you know the the num the data's there we
 
03:46:21.590 --> 03:46:21.600 align:start position:0%
do know we have a recruitment and
 
03:46:23.510 --> 03:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
retention problem
 
03:46:25.790 --> 03:46:25.800 align:start position:0%
and the question is is this enough to
 
03:46:28.070 --> 03:46:28.080 align:start position:0%
solve it or at least make a big stab at
 
03:46:29.210 --> 03:46:29.220 align:start position:0%
solving it
 
03:46:33.769 --> 03:46:33.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:35.990 --> 03:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
representative Simon thank you madam
 
03:46:39.050 --> 03:46:39.060 align:start position:0%
chair and this might be I mean it is a
 
03:46:40.790 --> 03:46:40.800 align:start position:0%
bit of a controversy
 
03:46:42.530 --> 03:46:42.540 align:start position:0%
um but also according to the
 
03:46:43.870 --> 03:46:43.880 align:start position:0%
Constitution we're not allowed to make
 
03:46:46.250 --> 03:46:46.260 align:start position:0%
retroactive law and and I do think that
 
03:46:48.290 --> 03:46:48.300 align:start position:0%
comes into play here
 
03:46:50.630 --> 03:46:50.640 align:start position:0%
um the terms that were changed were not
 
03:46:53.090 --> 03:46:53.100 align:start position:0%
contractual changes they were changes
 
03:46:55.969 --> 03:46:55.979 align:start position:0%
that were made to statute so unlike
 
03:46:57.889 --> 03:46:57.899 align:start position:0%
other pensions
 
03:46:57.899 --> 03:46:58.670 align:start position:0%
other pensions
um

03:46:58.670 --> 03:46:58.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:47:00.610 --> 03:47:00.620 align:start position:0%
the nhrs
 
03:47:02.990 --> 03:47:03.000 align:start position:0%
their their benefits or their their
 
03:47:05.330 --> 03:47:05.340 align:start position:0%
terms are are actually written into law
 
03:47:07.910 --> 03:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
their their New Hampshire law and so
 
03:47:09.710 --> 03:47:09.720 align:start position:0%
there is an argument to be made that
 
03:47:11.090 --> 03:47:11.100 align:start position:0%
when we went back and had to make
 
03:47:14.030 --> 03:47:14.040 align:start position:0%
changes in 2011 when we made the changes
 
03:47:15.469 --> 03:47:15.479 align:start position:0%
to the benefit program we were making
 
03:47:17.830 --> 03:47:17.840 align:start position:0%
them in statute and therefore making
 
03:47:20.690 --> 03:47:20.700 align:start position:0%
retroactive statute that was injurious
 
03:47:22.729 --> 03:47:22.739 align:start position:0%
to people it changed the rate of their
 
03:47:24.650 --> 03:47:24.660 align:start position:0%
compensation in a sense through their
 
03:47:26.809 --> 03:47:26.819 align:start position:0%
retirement benefits
 
03:47:29.210 --> 03:47:29.220 align:start position:0%
um so yes this isn't
 
03:47:32.450 --> 03:47:32.460 align:start position:0%
from that perspective a new benefit it's
 
03:47:34.130 --> 03:47:34.140 align:start position:0%
simply a check that was written a while
 
03:47:36.050 --> 03:47:36.060 align:start position:0%
ago that really hasn't been cached and
 
03:47:38.269 --> 03:47:38.279 align:start position:0%
now it's kind of time to pay it can also
 
03:47:39.769 --> 03:47:39.779 align:start position:0%
be looked up from that perspective so
 
03:47:41.690 --> 03:47:41.700 align:start position:0%
just offer that
 
03:47:41.700 --> 03:47:44.269 align:start position:0%
just offer that
representative

03:47:44.269 --> 03:47:44.279 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:47:46.250 --> 03:47:46.260 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
03:47:48.469 --> 03:47:48.479 align:start position:0%
I wanted to
 
03:47:52.190 --> 03:47:52.200 align:start position:0%
reiterate what representative Simon just
 
03:47:55.849 --> 03:47:55.859 align:start position:0%
stated about retroactive changes and the
 
03:47:58.250 --> 03:47:58.260 align:start position:0%
fact of the matter is these benefits
 
03:48:02.269 --> 03:48:02.279 align:start position:0%
were given as a term of employment and
 
03:48:05.210 --> 03:48:05.220 align:start position:0%
then taken away and I I think this is
 
03:48:08.630 --> 03:48:08.640 align:start position:0%
our opportunity to right the wrong uh
 
03:48:11.830 --> 03:48:11.840 align:start position:0%
also to representative
 
03:48:15.650 --> 03:48:15.660 align:start position:0%
McGuire's comments regarding retention I
 
03:48:17.349 --> 03:48:17.359 align:start position:0%
have heard
 
03:48:19.570 --> 03:48:19.580 align:start position:0%
directly from
 
03:48:23.330 --> 03:48:23.340 align:start position:0%
corrections officer who oversees the
 
03:48:25.550 --> 03:48:25.560 align:start position:0%
correction officers out of wolfborough
 
03:48:28.910 --> 03:48:28.920 align:start position:0%
wolfborough that they will in fact stay
 
03:48:31.010 --> 03:48:31.020 align:start position:0%
if we can get this in place
 
03:48:33.530 --> 03:48:33.540 align:start position:0%
so that those are my comments thank you
 
03:48:33.540 --> 03:48:37.610 align:start position:0%
so that those are my comments thank you
okay

03:48:37.610 --> 03:48:37.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:42.590 --> 03:48:42.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:45.290 --> 03:48:45.300 align:start position:0%
all right in that case the motion is to
 
03:48:47.650 --> 03:48:47.660 align:start position:0%
adopt amendment
 
03:48:51.170 --> 03:48:51.180 align:start position:0%
0483h to House Bill 436
 
03:48:52.969 --> 03:48:52.979 align:start position:0%

is Dan McGuire I represent the town of
 
04:30:50.580 --> 04:30:51.729 align:start position:0%
is Dan McGuire I represent the town of
epson

epson
 
04:30:55.550 --> 04:30:55.560 align:start position:0%
and um the the bill I'm going to talk to
 
04:30:59.149 --> 04:30:59.159 align:start position:0%
you about today is House Bill 559 we got
 
04:31:01.429 --> 04:31:01.439 align:start position:0%
it fairly late in the drafting process
 
04:31:04.250 --> 04:31:04.260 align:start position:0%
and so I asked for an amendment which I
 
04:31:07.070 --> 04:31:07.080 align:start position:0%
got back just last night and we already
 
04:31:10.610 --> 04:31:10.620 align:start position:0%
found an error or two so I handed it out
 
04:31:13.429 --> 04:31:13.439 align:start position:0%
it's not that different in structure or
 
04:31:16.010 --> 04:31:16.020 align:start position:0%
content from from the original bill but
 
04:31:17.689 --> 04:31:17.699 align:start position:0%
I'm going to leave it to representative
 
04:31:22.010 --> 04:31:22.020 align:start position:0%
uh like us to to talk about that in the
 
04:31:24.530 --> 04:31:24.540 align:start position:0%
details I'm going to talk about the big
 
04:31:26.750 --> 04:31:26.760 align:start position:0%
Concepts and the and the important
 
04:31:28.849 --> 04:31:28.859 align:start position:0%
aspects of this bill
 
04:31:31.130 --> 04:31:31.140 align:start position:0%
and Madam chair with your permission I
 
04:31:32.990 --> 04:31:33.000 align:start position:0%
mean I'm gonna unfortunately have to
 
04:31:35.210 --> 04:31:35.220 align:start position:0%
speak for longer than three minutes and
 
04:31:37.670 --> 04:31:37.680 align:start position:0%
so I I'm going to if it's all right so
 
04:31:40.570 --> 04:31:40.580 align:start position:0%
listen to questions as I go at that
 
04:31:43.729 --> 04:31:43.739 align:start position:0%
appropriate break points as opposed to
 
04:31:45.610 --> 04:31:45.620 align:start position:0%
you know talking for 20 minutes and then
 
04:31:49.010 --> 04:31:49.020 align:start position:0%
and then stopping right so committee if
 
04:31:52.429 --> 04:31:52.439 align:start position:0%
you uh have an urgent question or when
 
04:31:55.550 --> 04:31:55.560 align:start position:0%
he pauses we will take questions then
 
04:31:59.990 --> 04:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
all right so this bill would is a is a
 
04:32:03.349 --> 04:32:03.359 align:start position:0%
very small step to introduce a defined
 
04:32:05.870 --> 04:32:05.880 align:start position:0%
contribution pension plan to Prime
 
04:32:07.849 --> 04:32:07.859 align:start position:0%
contribution retirement plan
 
04:32:10.550 --> 04:32:10.560 align:start position:0%
to public employees in the state of New
 
04:32:10.560 --> 04:32:11.389 align:start position:0%
to public employees in the state of New
Hampshire

04:32:11.389 --> 04:32:11.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:32:14.389 --> 04:32:14.399 align:start position:0%
it it carves out a very tiny set of
 
04:32:17.389 --> 04:32:17.399 align:start position:0%
those employees new
 
04:32:17.399 --> 04:32:19.130 align:start position:0%
those employees new
state

04:32:19.130 --> 04:32:19.140 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:32:22.969 --> 04:32:22.979 align:start position:0%
group one employees so not anyone who is
 
04:32:22.979 --> 04:32:23.950 align:start position:0%
group one employees so not anyone who is
currently

04:32:23.950 --> 04:32:23.960 align:start position:0%
currently
 
04:32:27.769 --> 04:32:27.779 align:start position:0%
an employee people who would start after
 
04:32:31.729 --> 04:32:31.739 align:start position:0%
July on July 1st 2024 or later
 
04:32:33.710 --> 04:32:33.720 align:start position:0%
people who work for the state and people
 
04:32:36.349 --> 04:32:36.359 align:start position:0%
who would be part of group one otherwise
 
04:32:38.570 --> 04:32:38.580 align:start position:0%
just for Simplicity we call this group
 
04:32:42.769 --> 04:32:42.779 align:start position:0%
three so so it's easier to talk about
 
04:32:46.670 --> 04:32:46.680 align:start position:0%
um the current defined benefit plan the
 
04:32:48.710 --> 04:32:48.720 align:start position:0%
current Retirement System
 
04:32:53.710 --> 04:32:53.720 align:start position:0%
is Antiquated in my view it was designed
 
04:32:57.769 --> 04:32:57.779 align:start position:0%
for a long time ago for situation that
 
04:32:59.229 --> 04:32:59.239 align:start position:0%
that doesn't
 
04:33:01.450 --> 04:33:01.460 align:start position:0%
maintain today
 
04:33:04.070 --> 04:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
and that's why if you look at the the
 
04:33:06.709 --> 04:33:06.719 align:start position:0%
private sector you'll see that almost
 
04:33:09.590 --> 04:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
all such plans have disappeared
 
04:33:13.070 --> 04:33:13.080 align:start position:0%
right in the private sector people both
 
04:33:15.769 --> 04:33:15.779 align:start position:0%
employers and employees have strong
 
04:33:19.010 --> 04:33:19.020 align:start position:0%
incentives to do what each other likes
 
04:33:21.730 --> 04:33:21.740 align:start position:0%
right I mean it's hard to find employees
 
04:33:25.429 --> 04:33:25.439 align:start position:0%
so they have to be satisfied and and
 
04:33:27.529 --> 04:33:27.539 align:start position:0%
what what we see in the private sector
 
04:33:30.349 --> 04:33:30.359 align:start position:0%
is Define contribution plans
 
04:33:33.230 --> 04:33:33.240 align:start position:0%
so let's talk about the weaknesses of a
 
04:33:35.209 --> 04:33:35.219 align:start position:0%
defined benefit plan
 
04:33:39.230 --> 04:33:39.240 align:start position:0%
so first of all it's a fixed income plan
 
04:33:42.051 --> 04:33:42.061 align:start position:0%
the amount of income that you get is
 
04:33:43.730 --> 04:33:43.740 align:start position:0%
when you retire
 
04:33:46.369 --> 04:33:46.379 align:start position:0%
it comes to you according to a formula
 
04:33:48.709 --> 04:33:48.719 align:start position:0%
and I put the formula there it's the
 
04:33:51.529 --> 04:33:51.539 align:start position:0%
number of years of service times the
 
04:33:53.769 --> 04:33:53.779 align:start position:0%
average of your top five earning years
 
04:33:57.470 --> 04:33:57.480 align:start position:0%
divided by 66. assuming you're 65 and
 
04:33:58.849 --> 04:33:58.859 align:start position:0%
older and there's some changes for
 
04:34:00.709 --> 04:34:00.719 align:start position:0%
different areas but that's it basically
 
04:34:03.709 --> 04:34:03.719 align:start position:0%
it the main problem with a fixed income
 
04:34:07.131 --> 04:34:07.141 align:start position:0%
is what you've all seen with requests
 
04:34:10.970 --> 04:34:10.980 align:start position:0%
for colas fixed income doesn't work when
 
04:34:12.949 --> 04:34:12.959 align:start position:0%
there's inflation
 
04:34:14.990 --> 04:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
a defined contribution plan on the other
 
04:34:17.869 --> 04:34:17.879 align:start position:0%
hand is not a fixed income right you
 
04:34:21.289 --> 04:34:21.299 align:start position:0%
have at least some chance that it will
 
04:34:24.230 --> 04:34:24.240 align:start position:0%
increase your income with inflation
 
04:34:27.230 --> 04:34:27.240 align:start position:0%
because you own things you own stocks
 
04:34:29.449 --> 04:34:29.459 align:start position:0%
and businesses and real estate and stuff
 
04:34:32.150 --> 04:34:32.160 align:start position:0%
like that for your retirement and so
 
04:34:36.590 --> 04:34:36.600 align:start position:0%
it's not a formula it's it's uh um it's
 
04:34:38.869 --> 04:34:38.879 align:start position:0%
an actual investment okay
 
04:34:43.070 --> 04:34:43.080 align:start position:0%
secondly it's a defined benefit plan is
 
04:34:45.170 --> 04:34:45.180 align:start position:0%
is not portable
 
04:34:47.750 --> 04:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
and in this group of employees that
 
04:34:50.330 --> 04:34:50.340 align:start position:0%
we're talking about there's a large
 
04:34:53.689 --> 04:34:53.699 align:start position:0%
number of employees that don't last till
 
04:34:55.910 --> 04:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
vesting so the current defined benefit
 
04:34:58.789 --> 04:34:58.799 align:start position:0%
plan has 10-year vesting
 
04:35:02.869 --> 04:35:02.879 align:start position:0%
so I ask you to turn to
 
04:35:05.570 --> 04:35:05.580 align:start position:0%
um oh let's turn to page two
 
04:35:07.609 --> 04:35:07.619 align:start position:0%
so you see the chart that's that's
 
04:35:10.910 --> 04:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
inflation right so so
 
04:35:13.490 --> 04:35:13.500 align:start position:0%
um these are 20-year periods starting in
 
04:35:16.010 --> 04:35:16.020 align:start position:0%
night ending in 1948 through the present
 
04:35:18.410 --> 04:35:18.420 align:start position:0%
so you can see in certain periods we've
 
04:35:22.070 --> 04:35:22.080 align:start position:0%
had up to 250 percent inflation and in
 
04:35:25.369 --> 04:35:25.379 align:start position:0%
the minimum it's something like 75 50 to
 
04:35:28.670 --> 04:35:28.680 align:start position:0%
75 percent inflation right so so I think
 
04:35:30.590 --> 04:35:30.600 align:start position:0%
we're on the upslope and we can talk
 
04:35:34.189 --> 04:35:34.199 align:start position:0%
about why at maybe via question but but
 
04:35:36.230 --> 04:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
I think we're getting heading back to
 
04:35:38.990 --> 04:35:39.000 align:start position:0%
one of those High inflation periods okay
 
04:35:41.570 --> 04:35:41.580 align:start position:0%
now look at this toward the bottom where
 
04:35:43.310 --> 04:35:43.320 align:start position:0%
it says number of jobs held in a
 
04:35:43.320 --> 04:35:44.390 align:start position:0%
it says number of jobs held in a
lifetime

04:35:44.390 --> 04:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
lifetime
 
04:35:47.090 --> 04:35:47.100 align:start position:0%
so this is statistics from the Bureau of
 
04:35:50.269 --> 04:35:50.279 align:start position:0%
Labor Statistics they say that the
 
04:35:53.890 --> 04:35:53.900 align:start position:0%
average person that they studied in this
 
04:35:56.990 --> 04:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
group eight people who were born between
 
04:36:02.029 --> 04:36:02.039 align:start position:0%
1957 and 1964 is that they had 12.4 jobs
 
04:36:04.609 --> 04:36:04.619 align:start position:0%
in their lifetime
 
04:36:07.429 --> 04:36:07.439 align:start position:0%
all right so on average they're staying
 
04:36:09.429 --> 04:36:09.439 align:start position:0%
at a job three three and a half years
 
04:36:13.131 --> 04:36:13.141 align:start position:0%
they have lots of different jobs so the
 
04:36:16.010 --> 04:36:16.020 align:start position:0%
fraction that will be there for 10-year
 
04:36:19.551 --> 04:36:19.561 align:start position:0%
vesting in this group is very small and
 
04:36:21.529 --> 04:36:21.539 align:start position:0%
and in fact if you look at the very the
 
04:36:23.990 --> 04:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
paragraph at the bottom these are the
 
04:36:26.090 --> 04:36:26.100 align:start position:0%
numbers assumed by the New Hampshire
 
04:36:28.849 --> 04:36:28.859 align:start position:0%
retirement system for how many people
 
04:36:31.310 --> 04:36:31.320 align:start position:0%
are going to quit every year or get
 
04:36:33.529 --> 04:36:33.539 align:start position:0%
terminated maybe they get fired who
 
04:36:35.150 --> 04:36:35.160 align:start position:0%
knows but they leave the system every
 
04:36:38.750 --> 04:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
year so people with up to one year of
 
04:36:41.810 --> 04:36:41.820 align:start position:0%
service 27 so people in their first year
 
04:36:45.709 --> 04:36:45.719 align:start position:0%
of hire 27 percent gone of the remaining
 
04:36:48.490 --> 04:36:48.500 align:start position:0%
people second year 21
 
04:36:50.769 --> 04:36:50.779 align:start position:0%
third year 15
 
04:36:55.330 --> 04:36:55.340 align:start position:0%
fourth year 12 then 10 so all together
 
04:36:59.330 --> 04:36:59.340 align:start position:0%
that's 61 of the people who start so
 
04:37:03.709 --> 04:37:03.719 align:start position:0%
after five years you only have 39 of the
 
04:37:05.810 --> 04:37:05.820 align:start position:0%
people you started with left and they
 
04:37:08.650 --> 04:37:08.660 align:start position:0%
still have five years for to vest right
 
04:37:11.449 --> 04:37:11.459 align:start position:0%
so the fraction of people that you're
 
04:37:15.170 --> 04:37:15.180 align:start position:0%
helping with the system is low right um
 
04:37:17.029 --> 04:37:17.039 align:start position:0%
why we we have trouble hiring and we
 
04:37:19.250 --> 04:37:19.260 align:start position:0%
have trouble keeping people is the
 
04:37:21.349 --> 04:37:21.359 align:start position:0%
system doesn't work for them it doesn't
 
04:37:24.051 --> 04:37:24.061 align:start position:0%
work for people that are normal that
 
04:37:27.890 --> 04:37:27.900 align:start position:0%
that move around on jobs right so so it
 
04:37:31.490 --> 04:37:31.500 align:start position:0%
if you go afterwards after the 10 they
 
04:37:33.709 --> 04:37:33.719 align:start position:0%
they assume roughly seven percent per
 
04:37:36.890 --> 04:37:36.900 align:start position:0%
year so what that works out to what that
 
04:37:40.369 --> 04:37:40.379 align:start position:0%
pencils out to is only 27 percent of the
 
04:37:42.890 --> 04:37:42.900 align:start position:0%
original people that were hired make it
 
04:37:47.449 --> 04:37:47.459 align:start position:0%
to vesting right 73 don't
 
04:37:50.269 --> 04:37:50.279 align:start position:0%
all right so the system to the extent
 
04:37:52.910 --> 04:37:52.920 align:start position:0%
that it works and helps people who are
 
04:37:52.920 --> 04:37:53.990 align:start position:0%
that it works and helps people who are
vested

04:37:53.990 --> 04:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
vested
 
04:37:56.390 --> 04:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
is helping a very small fraction of the
 
04:37:59.330 --> 04:37:59.340 align:start position:0%
of the total employees so so it's it
 
04:38:02.929 --> 04:38:02.939 align:start position:0%
this is an issue it doesn't comport with
 
04:38:06.051 --> 04:38:06.061 align:start position:0%
the actual experience of employees now I
 
04:38:08.330 --> 04:38:08.340 align:start position:0%
personally think okay just a moment
 
04:38:13.010 --> 04:38:13.020 align:start position:0%
Peter I I I personally think that
 
04:38:15.529 --> 04:38:15.539 align:start position:0%
um these numbers are high these are
 
04:38:17.269 --> 04:38:17.279 align:start position:0%
assume numbers by the New Hampshire
 
04:38:19.490 --> 04:38:19.500 align:start position:0%
retirement system they also gave me
 
04:38:22.369 --> 04:38:22.379 align:start position:0%
actual numbers for for a sort of subset
 
04:38:25.910 --> 04:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
and that are a little bit lower and so
 
04:38:28.490 --> 04:38:28.500 align:start position:0%
but but they weren't complete enough to
 
04:38:30.230 --> 04:38:30.240 align:start position:0%
to really give you how much this year
 
04:38:32.449 --> 04:38:32.459 align:start position:0%
how much that year I'm happy to take a
 
04:38:32.459 --> 04:38:35.810 align:start position:0%
how much that year I'm happy to take a
question

04:38:35.810 --> 04:38:35.820 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:38.810 --> 04:38:38.820 align:start position:0%
thank you both representative McGuire's
 
04:38:38.820 --> 04:38:39.590 align:start position:0%
thank you both representative McGuire's
um

04:38:39.590 --> 04:38:39.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:38:39.600 --> 04:38:41.090 align:start position:0%
um
um

04:38:41.090 --> 04:38:41.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:38:44.810 --> 04:38:44.820 align:start position:0%
so the the people who leave in your
 
04:38:47.209 --> 04:38:47.219 align:start position:0%
earlier uh
 
04:38:50.510 --> 04:38:50.520 align:start position:0%
in your earlier presentation does that
 
04:38:52.250 --> 04:38:52.260 align:start position:0%
factor in people who
 
04:38:55.131 --> 04:38:55.141 align:start position:0%
go away and come back
 
04:38:57.349 --> 04:38:57.359 align:start position:0%
because we we know a number of our
 
04:38:59.029 --> 04:38:59.039 align:start position:0%
employees they're here for a couple
 
04:39:00.250 --> 04:39:00.260 align:start position:0%
years whatever
 
04:39:02.869 --> 04:39:02.879 align:start position:0%
especially with women who go away for
 
04:39:05.510 --> 04:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
childbearing purposes uh they come back
 
04:39:07.910 --> 04:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
later does it do your figures factor
 
04:39:09.170 --> 04:39:09.180 align:start position:0%
that in
 
04:39:10.730 --> 04:39:10.740 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question I don't
 
04:39:14.929 --> 04:39:14.939 align:start position:0%
exactly know so this is assume numbers
 
04:39:17.449 --> 04:39:17.459 align:start position:0%
that the the retirement system gave me
 
04:39:20.209 --> 04:39:20.219 align:start position:0%
so Mr Carlin probably could answer that
 
04:39:23.869 --> 04:39:23.879 align:start position:0%
better but but in a sense I think of the
 
04:39:26.090 --> 04:39:26.100 align:start position:0%
the the picture of employees like a
 
04:39:28.730 --> 04:39:28.740 align:start position:0%
funnel right you start with a certain
 
04:39:31.551 --> 04:39:31.561 align:start position:0%
number of hires and some leave after the
 
04:39:33.170 --> 04:39:33.180 align:start position:0%
first year and some leave after the
 
04:39:34.490 --> 04:39:34.500 align:start position:0%
second year and some leave after third
 
04:39:37.310 --> 04:39:37.320 align:start position:0%
year like that maybe some come in and
 
04:39:39.288 --> 04:39:39.298 align:start position:0%
now they would be in their second year
 
04:39:42.530 --> 04:39:42.540 align:start position:0%
again right so something that sort but
 
04:39:45.948 --> 04:39:45.958 align:start position:0%
but the number in service in each year
 
04:39:49.250 --> 04:39:49.260 align:start position:0%
is declining right thank you
 
04:39:51.050 --> 04:39:51.060 align:start position:0%
okay represent Mayberry and
 
04:39:53.208 --> 04:39:53.218 align:start position:0%
representative shewitt
 
04:39:55.190 --> 04:39:55.200 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
04:39:57.050 --> 04:39:57.060 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for being here
 
04:39:59.750 --> 04:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
today and I'd like to commend you and
 
04:40:04.368 --> 04:40:04.378 align:start position:0%
your co-sponsors on this kind of Bill
 
04:40:08.810 --> 04:40:08.820 align:start position:0%
the control for the generation coming in
 
04:40:10.670 --> 04:40:10.680 align:start position:0%
wants that full control
 
04:40:12.708 --> 04:40:12.718 align:start position:0%
I know that you don't have all of the
 
04:40:14.630 --> 04:40:14.640 align:start position:0%
specifics yet
 
04:40:17.270 --> 04:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
um but I'm curious
 
04:40:20.570 --> 04:40:20.580 align:start position:0%
um if they will have the control that
 
04:40:22.368 --> 04:40:22.378 align:start position:0%
I'm familiar with in the private sector
 
04:40:24.770 --> 04:40:24.780 align:start position:0%
of going and choosing their Investments
 
04:40:27.410 --> 04:40:27.420 align:start position:0%
not having a
 
04:40:30.110 --> 04:40:30.120 align:start position:0%
um executive Council appointed board
 
04:40:33.590 --> 04:40:33.600 align:start position:0%
that's chosen the Investments thank you
 
04:40:34.910 --> 04:40:34.920 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for the question the
 
04:40:37.430 --> 04:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
answer is absolutely yes because in
 
04:40:41.690 --> 04:40:41.700 align:start position:0%
particular the state already has for 35
 
04:40:43.970 --> 04:40:43.980 align:start position:0%
years what's called a Deferred
 
04:40:47.390 --> 04:40:47.400 align:start position:0%
Compensation Plan it's called a 457 plan
 
04:40:51.170 --> 04:40:51.180 align:start position:0%
and so employees can now volunteer it's
 
04:40:53.448 --> 04:40:53.458 align:start position:0%
very similar to an IRA you can volunteer
 
04:40:56.868 --> 04:40:56.878 align:start position:0%
to put pre-tax money into this plan and
 
04:40:59.750 --> 04:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
you're given a menu of choices on how
 
04:41:01.970 --> 04:41:01.980 align:start position:0%
you invest that money and it's all up to
 
04:41:04.970 --> 04:41:04.980 align:start position:0%
you and it's run by somebody like Schwab
 
04:41:06.590 --> 04:41:06.600 align:start position:0%
or Fidelity or one of those kind of
 
04:41:10.070 --> 04:41:10.080 align:start position:0%
things yes so this this bill in in fact
 
04:41:13.250 --> 04:41:13.260 align:start position:0%
puts the employee so there are employee
 
04:41:15.410 --> 04:41:15.420 align:start position:0%
contributions and employer contributions
 
04:41:17.868 --> 04:41:17.878 align:start position:0%
this puts the employee contributions
 
04:41:20.690 --> 04:41:20.700 align:start position:0%
into the 457 plan we've had it for years
 
04:41:23.330 --> 04:41:23.340 align:start position:0%
and years we've had it for decades this
 
04:41:25.190 --> 04:41:25.200 align:start position:0%
creates a new plan and it's only
 
04:41:28.128 --> 04:41:28.138 align:start position:0%
technically because of IRS creates a new
 
04:41:31.788 --> 04:41:31.798 align:start position:0%
pot for the employer contribution but it
 
04:41:34.368 --> 04:41:34.378 align:start position:0%
makes the two invested exactly the same
 
04:41:36.110 --> 04:41:36.120 align:start position:0%
way according to the employees desire
 
04:41:39.110 --> 04:41:39.120 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
04:41:41.570 --> 04:41:41.580 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair good afternoon
 
04:41:43.910 --> 04:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire good to see you
 
04:41:43.920 --> 04:41:45.590 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire good to see you
again

04:41:45.590 --> 04:41:45.600 align:start position:0%
again
 
04:41:49.270 --> 04:41:49.280 align:start position:0%
um the Bureau of Labor Statistics about
 
04:41:53.390 --> 04:41:53.400 align:start position:0%
the number of people leaving work so on
 
04:41:56.628 --> 04:41:56.638 align:start position:0%
and so forth were those just public
 
04:41:59.930 --> 04:41:59.940 align:start position:0%
employees or was that all of them no I
 
04:42:00.890 --> 04:42:00.900 align:start position:0%
think it's all
 
04:42:02.390 --> 04:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
right thank you
 
04:42:06.170 --> 04:42:06.180 align:start position:0%
and and again so that's why we have
 
04:42:08.448 --> 04:42:08.458 align:start position:0%
those other numbers from what the
 
04:42:10.430 --> 04:42:10.440 align:start position:0%
retirement system uses those are only
 
04:42:12.890 --> 04:42:12.900 align:start position:0%
public employees and I could also give
 
04:42:14.990 --> 04:42:15.000 align:start position:0%
you the numbers they gave from The
 
04:42:16.610 --> 04:42:16.620 align:start position:0%
Experience survey which are a little bit
 
04:42:20.090 --> 04:42:20.100 align:start position:0%
smaller okay but but they're not
 
04:42:23.090 --> 04:42:23.100 align:start position:0%
they're not complete enough to know X
 
04:42:25.730 --> 04:42:25.740 align:start position:0%
percent per year like that so thank you
 
04:42:28.610 --> 04:42:28.620 align:start position:0%
for that clarification for
 
04:42:31.250 --> 04:42:31.260 align:start position:0%
you thank you madam chair uh question
 
04:42:34.788 --> 04:42:34.798 align:start position:0%
I like the the idea of you encouraging
 
04:42:37.310 --> 04:42:37.320 align:start position:0%
people to invest in their own
 
04:42:40.250 --> 04:42:40.260 align:start position:0%
retirement savings whatever whatever the
 
04:42:42.230 --> 04:42:42.240 align:start position:0%
the money is going to be used for
 
04:42:44.750 --> 04:42:44.760 align:start position:0%
but I I'm concerned and I want to know
 
04:42:47.750 --> 04:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
how you address this is how you
 
04:42:50.990 --> 04:42:51.000 align:start position:0%
prevent irresponsible Behavior
 
04:42:54.110 --> 04:42:54.120 align:start position:0%
for example someone uh
 
04:42:56.030 --> 04:42:56.040 align:start position:0%
withdraws all their money out of their
 
04:42:58.150 --> 04:42:58.160 align:start position:0%
account so they can buy a fancy new car
 
04:43:02.030 --> 04:43:02.040 align:start position:0%
and then when the car is gone and
 
04:43:02.040 --> 04:43:03.050 align:start position:0%
and then when the car is gone and
they're

04:43:03.050 --> 04:43:03.060 align:start position:0%
they're
 
04:43:05.570 --> 04:43:05.580 align:start position:0%
time of money that they were saving in
 
04:43:08.930 --> 04:43:08.940 align:start position:0%
this plan is gone they end up in front
 
04:43:11.510 --> 04:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
of us again looking for us to help bail
 
04:43:14.750 --> 04:43:14.760 align:start position:0%
them out uh somehow so how do you deal
 
04:43:16.010 --> 04:43:16.020 align:start position:0%
with that all right thank you for the
 
04:43:19.030 --> 04:43:19.040 align:start position:0%
question so first of all the the plan
 
04:43:22.490 --> 04:43:22.500 align:start position:0%
puts into the system it requires someone
 
04:43:24.890 --> 04:43:24.900 align:start position:0%
to put into the system the same amount
 
04:43:27.190 --> 04:43:27.200 align:start position:0%
of money that's being put into group one
 
04:43:30.230 --> 04:43:30.240 align:start position:0%
retirements now right so
 
04:43:32.570 --> 04:43:32.580 align:start position:0%
um so the amount going in is the same
 
04:43:36.170 --> 04:43:36.180 align:start position:0%
now I believe that
 
04:43:38.948 --> 04:43:38.958 align:start position:0%
um people cannot
 
04:43:41.750 --> 04:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
withdrawal early they cannot withdraw
 
04:43:43.610 --> 04:43:43.620 align:start position:0%
before termination there are certain
 
04:43:45.530 --> 04:43:45.540 align:start position:0%
requirements in here about when you can
 
04:43:48.050 --> 04:43:48.060 align:start position:0%
withdrawal and it's termination or age
 
04:43:49.550 --> 04:43:49.560 align:start position:0%
such and such you know that kind of
 
04:43:51.590 --> 04:43:51.600 align:start position:0%
thing so I don't think they can do what
 
04:43:54.110 --> 04:43:54.120 align:start position:0%
you just described Mr Downing is in the
 
04:43:56.030 --> 04:43:56.040 align:start position:0%
audience and so I think he can answer
 
04:43:58.250 --> 04:43:58.260 align:start position:0%
that question a little more detail with
 
04:44:00.770 --> 04:44:00.780 align:start position:0%
regard to the existing 457 plan thank
 
04:44:00.780 --> 04:44:05.350 align:start position:0%
regard to the existing 457 plan thank
you

04:44:05.350 --> 04:44:05.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:07.730 --> 04:44:07.740 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
04:44:09.890 --> 04:44:09.900 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
04:44:12.770 --> 04:44:12.780 align:start position:0%
the other thing to think about so my
 
04:44:16.670 --> 04:44:16.680 align:start position:0%
father for example born in 1923 had a
 
04:44:18.590 --> 04:44:18.600 align:start position:0%
long career with IBM
 
04:44:21.470 --> 04:44:21.480 align:start position:0%
and he loved the defined benefit plan
 
04:44:24.288 --> 04:44:24.298 align:start position:0%
that IBM had he was into it right so he
 
04:44:25.368 --> 04:44:25.378 align:start position:0%
would know
 
04:44:28.810 --> 04:44:28.820 align:start position:0%
how much he was going to get Etc and
 
04:44:31.368 --> 04:44:31.378 align:start position:0%
again it's a fixed income plan so it's
 
04:44:34.070 --> 04:44:34.080 align:start position:0%
bad for inflation but also another
 
04:44:37.250 --> 04:44:37.260 align:start position:0%
aspect of it is it's a kind of an
 
04:44:41.628 --> 04:44:41.638 align:start position:0%
insurance plan because if you die early
 
04:44:44.390 --> 04:44:44.400 align:start position:0%
the earnings the savings that you earned
 
04:44:47.628 --> 04:44:47.638 align:start position:0%
and put into the plan go to others
 
04:44:49.788 --> 04:44:49.798 align:start position:0%
right they don't they're not inheritable
 
04:44:51.530 --> 04:44:51.540 align:start position:0%
by your heirs
 
04:44:54.110 --> 04:44:54.120 align:start position:0%
right so it's a kind of insurance right
 
04:44:56.628 --> 04:44:56.638 align:start position:0%
for the it's for the it's insurance for
 
04:45:00.288 --> 04:45:00.298 align:start position:0%
the person who happens to live to 95 at
 
04:45:03.110 --> 04:45:03.120 align:start position:0%
the expense of those who live to 65 or
 
04:45:04.788 --> 04:45:04.798 align:start position:0%
that that sort of thing you see what I
 
04:45:08.330 --> 04:45:08.340 align:start position:0%
mean and so I remember him telling me at
 
04:45:11.390 --> 04:45:11.400 align:start position:0%
one point that they had statistics that
 
04:45:13.490 --> 04:45:13.500 align:start position:0%
the the average person after they
 
04:45:16.190 --> 04:45:16.200 align:start position:0%
retired from IBM they only lived five
 
04:45:16.200 --> 04:45:17.448 align:start position:0%
retired from IBM they only lived five
years

04:45:17.448 --> 04:45:17.458 align:start position:0%
years
 
04:45:20.628 --> 04:45:20.638 align:start position:0%
right so they lived a very you know life
 
04:45:22.850 --> 04:45:22.860 align:start position:0%
expectancy in those days was much less
 
04:45:25.310 --> 04:45:25.320 align:start position:0%
right so people lived only just a few
 
04:45:28.128 --> 04:45:28.138 align:start position:0%
years after retirement so it made sense
 
04:45:30.410 --> 04:45:30.420 align:start position:0%
to have insurance right in case you
 
04:45:33.050 --> 04:45:33.060 align:start position:0%
happen to live 20 years instead of five
 
04:45:35.270 --> 04:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
right so those kind of plans made sense
 
04:45:37.610 --> 04:45:37.620 align:start position:0%
but today we don't think about it that
 
04:45:39.890 --> 04:45:39.900 align:start position:0%
way right we think we're going to retire
 
04:45:42.590 --> 04:45:42.600 align:start position:0%
at 65 and we're going to live to 85
 
04:45:46.970 --> 04:45:46.980 align:start position:0%
right so we need 20 years of income and
 
04:45:46.980 --> 04:45:48.350 align:start position:0%
right so we need 20 years of income and
so

04:45:48.350 --> 04:45:48.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:45:52.670 --> 04:45:52.680 align:start position:0%
um so it this is the insurance aspects
 
04:45:54.708 --> 04:45:54.718 align:start position:0%
of a defined benefit plan
 
04:45:56.810 --> 04:45:56.820 align:start position:0%
aren't really right
 
04:46:01.550 --> 04:46:01.560 align:start position:0%
uh for today's employees okay all right
 
04:46:04.610 --> 04:46:04.620 align:start position:0%
now same thing uh one size fits all so
 
04:46:04.620 --> 04:46:06.170 align:start position:0%
now same thing uh one size fits all so
so

04:46:06.170 --> 04:46:06.180 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:46:08.270 --> 04:46:08.280 align:start position:0%
um a defined benefit plan everybody is
 
04:46:10.490 --> 04:46:10.500 align:start position:0%
treated the same by the certain formula
 
04:46:12.890 --> 04:46:12.900 align:start position:0%
but that not might not be right for
 
04:46:14.510 --> 04:46:14.520 align:start position:0%
everybody you know some people might
 
04:46:16.990 --> 04:46:17.000 align:start position:0%
choose to uh
 
04:46:19.550 --> 04:46:19.560 align:start position:0%
have other Investments and other things
 
04:46:21.470 --> 04:46:21.480 align:start position:0%
going on with their life with their
 
04:46:24.590 --> 04:46:24.600 align:start position:0%
spouse and so on this plan lets people
 
04:46:27.410 --> 04:46:27.420 align:start position:0%
invest the way they would be right for
 
04:46:27.420 --> 04:46:28.368 align:start position:0%
invest the way they would be right for
them

04:46:28.368 --> 04:46:28.378 align:start position:0%
them
 
04:46:30.708 --> 04:46:30.718 align:start position:0%
all right now let's get to this big part
 
04:46:33.050 --> 04:46:33.060 align:start position:0%
the guesswork
 
04:46:34.730 --> 04:46:34.740 align:start position:0%
the problem with the defined benefit
 
04:46:37.310 --> 04:46:37.320 align:start position:0%
plan is
 
04:46:40.250 --> 04:46:40.260 align:start position:0%
and this is the problem so any further
 
04:46:41.510 --> 04:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
questions maybe I should stop for
 
04:46:42.948 --> 04:46:42.958 align:start position:0%
aggression here any further questions
 
04:46:46.368 --> 04:46:46.378 align:start position:0%
about the the the drawbacks or this or
 
04:46:48.890 --> 04:46:48.900 align:start position:0%
the benefits of defined benefit with
 
04:46:52.970 --> 04:46:52.980 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:55.490 --> 04:46:55.500 align:start position:0%
no okay good all right so let's talk
 
04:46:58.070 --> 04:46:58.080 align:start position:0%
about the drawbacks with regard to the
 
04:46:58.080 --> 04:46:59.270 align:start position:0%
about the drawbacks with regard to the
employer

04:46:59.270 --> 04:46:59.280 align:start position:0%
employer
 
04:47:04.910 --> 04:47:04.920 align:start position:0%
okay so this plan defined benefit plan
 
04:47:06.770 --> 04:47:06.780 align:start position:0%
and you know this well from your
 
04:47:08.590 --> 04:47:08.600 align:start position:0%
experience on this committee
 
04:47:13.128 --> 04:47:13.138 align:start position:0%
requires the employer to guess what's
 
04:47:15.110 --> 04:47:15.120 align:start position:0%
going on in the future
 
04:47:18.050 --> 04:47:18.060 align:start position:0%
right we have we have we're putting in
 
04:47:21.650 --> 04:47:21.660 align:start position:0%
where we're expecting benefits and so on
 
04:47:24.110 --> 04:47:24.120 align:start position:0%
to be a certain amount and then we
 
04:47:26.930 --> 04:47:26.940 align:start position:0%
calculate therefore the employer has to
 
04:47:30.830 --> 04:47:30.840 align:start position:0%
put in so much today to reach that point
 
04:47:33.110 --> 04:47:33.120 align:start position:0%
but that's just a guess right it's an
 
04:47:35.150 --> 04:47:35.160 align:start position:0%
educated guess you pay very expensive
 
04:47:37.010 --> 04:47:37.020 align:start position:0%
people a lot of money to make that guess
 
04:47:40.310 --> 04:47:40.320 align:start position:0%
but how good is it really right and
 
04:47:44.150 --> 04:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:48.948 --> 04:47:48.958 align:start position:0%
so page three is the piece of paper that
 
04:47:51.770 --> 04:47:51.780 align:start position:0%
describes the unfunded liability that
 
04:47:55.128 --> 04:47:55.138 align:start position:0%
this is what the legislature received in
 
04:47:55.138 --> 04:47:57.288 align:start position:0%
this is what the legislature received in
2007.

04:47:57.288 --> 04:47:57.298 align:start position:0%
2007.
 
04:48:03.050 --> 04:48:03.060 align:start position:0%
okay so in 2007 when the uh unfunded
 
04:48:06.590 --> 04:48:06.600 align:start position:0%
liability was look at the first line two
 
04:48:11.270 --> 04:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
two billion 397 million okay that was
 
04:48:14.030 --> 04:48:14.040 align:start position:0%
the unfunded liability at the time the
 
04:48:16.550 --> 04:48:16.560 align:start position:0%
payroll at the time was two point also
 
04:48:16.560 --> 04:48:18.128 align:start position:0%
payroll at the time was two point also
2.9

04:48:18.128 --> 04:48:18.138 align:start position:0%
2.9
 
04:48:20.810 --> 04:48:20.820 align:start position:0%
billion okay
 
04:48:24.230 --> 04:48:24.240 align:start position:0%
and here's what they projected for 2022.
 
04:48:26.208 --> 04:48:26.218 align:start position:0%
so look at line 13.
 
04:48:29.750 --> 04:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
so they expected that by 2022 our our
 
04:48:34.730 --> 04:48:34.740 align:start position:0%
payroll would be up to 4.25 billion and
 
04:48:38.690 --> 04:48:38.700 align:start position:0%
our unfunded liability would be 3.125
 
04:48:38.700 --> 04:48:40.010 align:start position:0%
our unfunded liability would be 3.125
billion

04:48:40.010 --> 04:48:40.020 align:start position:0%
billion
 
04:48:42.590 --> 04:48:42.600 align:start position:0%
okay so that's what they told people in
 
04:48:45.230 --> 04:48:45.240 align:start position:0%
2007 you follow our plan this is what's
 
04:48:46.490 --> 04:48:46.500 align:start position:0%
going to happen
 
04:48:50.690 --> 04:48:50.700 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:54.410 --> 04:48:54.420 align:start position:0%
so it's on the back right page four is
 
04:48:57.470 --> 04:48:57.480 align:start position:0%
this is the same piece of paper handed
 
04:48:58.910 --> 04:48:58.920 align:start position:0%
out today
 
04:49:01.850 --> 04:49:01.860 align:start position:0%
right so look at the Top Line our
 
04:49:03.970 --> 04:49:03.980 align:start position:0%
current unfunded liability
 
04:49:06.288 --> 04:49:06.298 align:start position:0%
5.7 billion
 
04:49:09.770 --> 04:49:09.780 align:start position:0%
right in 2007 they predicted that today
 
04:49:12.050 --> 04:49:12.060 align:start position:0%
it would be 3.125
 
04:49:14.390 --> 04:49:14.400 align:start position:0%
so it's a lot higher
 
04:49:14.400 --> 04:49:15.590 align:start position:0%
so it's a lot higher
okay

04:49:15.590 --> 04:49:15.600 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:49:18.708 --> 04:49:18.718 align:start position:0%
our current payroll is only 3 billion
 
04:49:22.510 --> 04:49:22.520 align:start position:0%
they thought that our payroll would be
 
04:49:26.830 --> 04:49:26.840 align:start position:0%
4.225 billion you see what I mean so
 
04:49:30.050 --> 04:49:30.060 align:start position:0%
this is why we're in trouble it's very
 
04:49:32.990 --> 04:49:33.000 align:start position:0%
hard to predict the future
 
04:49:36.830 --> 04:49:36.840 align:start position:0%
um and and even with the best people and
 
04:49:38.990 --> 04:49:39.000 align:start position:0%
the best intentions and all that sort of
 
04:49:41.570 --> 04:49:41.580 align:start position:0%
stuff right we're in much worse shape
 
04:49:44.750 --> 04:49:44.760 align:start position:0%
now than the legislatures who sat in
 
04:49:47.390 --> 04:49:47.400 align:start position:0%
this room 15 years ago thought we were
 
04:49:49.490 --> 04:49:49.500 align:start position:0%
going to be at this point
 
04:49:52.730 --> 04:49:52.740 align:start position:0%
okay and so I would say that that's
 
04:49:55.128 --> 04:49:55.138 align:start position:0%
inherent in the in the in a defined
 
04:49:57.350 --> 04:49:57.360 align:start position:0%
benefit plan
 
04:50:00.230 --> 04:50:00.240 align:start position:0%
um I was here when Mr Carlin gave you
 
04:50:02.930 --> 04:50:02.940 align:start position:0%
your introduction to the retirement
 
04:50:02.940 --> 04:50:03.830 align:start position:0%
your introduction to the retirement
system

04:50:03.830 --> 04:50:03.840 align:start position:0%
system
 
04:50:06.350 --> 04:50:06.360 align:start position:0%
and he said something very profound that
 
04:50:09.410 --> 04:50:09.420 align:start position:0%
day he was asked why are we in trouble
 
04:50:12.410 --> 04:50:12.420 align:start position:0%
right how did we get here and what he
 
04:50:15.708 --> 04:50:15.718 align:start position:0%
said was when you put several different
 
04:50:19.090 --> 04:50:19.100 align:start position:0%
choices in front of the legislature
 
04:50:22.610 --> 04:50:22.620 align:start position:0%
they're going to pick the cheapest one
 
04:50:26.510 --> 04:50:26.520 align:start position:0%
all right that's human nature right so
 
04:50:31.070 --> 04:50:31.080 align:start position:0%
so the legislature was given choices you
 
04:50:33.230 --> 04:50:33.240 align:start position:0%
could pay it off over 30 years you could
 
04:50:35.270 --> 04:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
pay it off 20 years right you could do
 
04:50:38.270 --> 04:50:38.280 align:start position:0%
different things to pay it off right and
 
04:50:40.730 --> 04:50:40.740 align:start position:0%
they picked the cheapest one for the
 
04:50:40.740 --> 04:50:41.868 align:start position:0%
they picked the cheapest one for the
moment

04:50:41.868 --> 04:50:41.878 align:start position:0%
moment
 
04:50:43.788 --> 04:50:43.798 align:start position:0%
and that's what we're constantly doing
 
04:50:46.310 --> 04:50:46.320 align:start position:0%
we're constant and we do it today right
 
04:50:49.190 --> 04:50:49.200 align:start position:0%
we ins if you look at this
 
04:50:52.610 --> 04:50:52.620 align:start position:0%
um second piece of page four
 
04:50:52.620 --> 04:50:53.410 align:start position:0%
um second piece of page four
um

04:50:53.410 --> 04:50:53.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:50:56.330 --> 04:50:56.340 align:start position:0%
well it's actually sorry it's it's not
 
04:50:58.030 --> 04:50:58.040 align:start position:0%
shown on page four all right
 
04:51:02.330 --> 04:51:02.340 align:start position:0%
look at um look at page three
 
04:51:04.970 --> 04:51:04.980 align:start position:0%
so the notice how the total contribution
 
04:51:07.970 --> 04:51:07.980 align:start position:0%
is 10.7 percent all the way down the
 
04:51:09.770 --> 04:51:09.780 align:start position:0%
line the second column
 
04:51:11.628 --> 04:51:11.638 align:start position:0%
right so that's the employer
 
04:51:13.910 --> 04:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
contribution to pay off this unfunded
 
04:51:15.770 --> 04:51:15.780 align:start position:0%
liability we still pay that roughly
 
04:51:19.190 --> 04:51:19.200 align:start position:0%
today we pay a 10.7 percent contribution
 
04:51:21.470 --> 04:51:21.480 align:start position:0%
to pay off the unfunded liability
 
04:51:24.410 --> 04:51:24.420 align:start position:0%
that's the cheap way of doing it right
 
04:51:26.750 --> 04:51:26.760 align:start position:0%
if you had a 30-year mortgage to pay
 
04:51:29.270 --> 04:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
something off you would pay the same
 
04:51:31.550 --> 04:51:31.560 align:start position:0%
dollar amount every year
 
04:51:34.368 --> 04:51:34.378 align:start position:0%
not the same percentage amount every
 
04:51:36.650 --> 04:51:36.660 align:start position:0%
year do you see what I mean so you would
 
04:51:37.868 --> 04:51:37.878 align:start position:0%
pay a lot
 
04:51:40.610 --> 04:51:40.620 align:start position:0%
you would pay more in the beginning and
 
04:51:44.270 --> 04:51:44.280 align:start position:0%
less and the end inflation adjusted but
 
04:51:46.310 --> 04:51:46.320 align:start position:0%
the plan we're actually using to pay off
 
04:51:49.788 --> 04:51:49.798 align:start position:0%
the unfunded liability is back loaded
 
04:51:52.788 --> 04:51:52.798 align:start position:0%
we are cheap now and we're planning to
 
04:51:54.890 --> 04:51:54.900 align:start position:0%
pay a lot more later
 
04:51:58.910 --> 04:51:58.920 align:start position:0%
all right that's not very sound uh
 
04:52:01.430 --> 04:52:01.440 align:start position:0%
financially right I mean it's it's just
 
04:52:04.128 --> 04:52:04.138 align:start position:0%
but it's it's human nature you know
 
04:52:07.368 --> 04:52:07.378 align:start position:0%
we're incentivized to do the right thing
 
04:52:09.650 --> 04:52:09.660 align:start position:0%
for our constituents today
 
04:52:11.690 --> 04:52:11.700 align:start position:0%
because they're in you know they have
 
04:52:14.270 --> 04:52:14.280 align:start position:0%
trouble today and you know people 10
 
04:52:16.390 --> 04:52:16.400 align:start position:0%
years from now that that's them you know
 
04:52:20.750 --> 04:52:20.760 align:start position:0%
so so the point is a defined
 
04:52:23.690 --> 04:52:23.700 align:start position:0%
contribution plan can't be in trouble in
 
04:52:26.990 --> 04:52:27.000 align:start position:0%
this way right it doesn't rely on
 
04:52:30.288 --> 04:52:30.298 align:start position:0%
guesses it doesn't rely on figuring out
 
04:52:33.288 --> 04:52:33.298 align:start position:0%
what the future is going to be
 
04:52:37.128 --> 04:52:37.138 align:start position:0%
um we pay today for today's expenses
 
04:52:40.390 --> 04:52:40.400 align:start position:0%
and and that's that okay so that's it so
 
04:52:44.868 --> 04:52:44.878 align:start position:0%
any questions yeah go ahead
 
04:52:46.250 --> 04:52:46.260 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you
 
04:52:47.628 --> 04:52:47.638 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire for taking my
 
04:52:47.638 --> 04:52:49.430 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire for taking my
question

04:52:49.430 --> 04:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:52:51.650 --> 04:52:51.660 align:start position:0%
as I go back to these two charts on page
 
04:52:54.470 --> 04:52:54.480 align:start position:0%
three in page four
 
04:52:57.708 --> 04:52:57.718 align:start position:0%
can you tell me back in 2007
 
04:53:00.288 --> 04:53:00.298 align:start position:0%
with the assumed rate of return was
 
04:53:02.810 --> 04:53:02.820 align:start position:0%
it was higher no question about it yeah
 
04:53:04.430 --> 04:53:04.440 align:start position:0%
I don't know the exact number but it was
 
04:53:07.070 --> 04:53:07.080 align:start position:0%
we're currently assuming 6.75 percent
 
04:53:09.890 --> 04:53:09.900 align:start position:0%
and then those days it was I don't know
 
04:53:11.570 --> 04:53:11.580 align:start position:0%
eight or nine or something but that
 
04:53:14.208 --> 04:53:14.218 align:start position:0%
itself is a guess right follow-up
 
04:53:14.218 --> 04:53:15.770 align:start position:0%
itself is a guess right follow-up
follow-up

04:53:15.770 --> 04:53:15.780 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
04:53:18.708 --> 04:53:18.718 align:start position:0%
so is it fair to say the comparison of
 
04:53:20.810 --> 04:53:20.820 align:start position:0%
the unfunded accrued liability using
 
04:53:24.110 --> 04:53:24.120 align:start position:0%
2007 versus what it is today
 
04:53:26.510 --> 04:53:26.520 align:start position:0%
is not similar because changing the
 
04:53:28.490 --> 04:53:28.500 align:start position:0%
unfunded accrued like changing the
 
04:53:30.350 --> 04:53:30.360 align:start position:0%
assumed rate of return changes that
 
04:53:30.360 --> 04:53:32.270 align:start position:0%
assumed rate of return changes that
number

04:53:32.270 --> 04:53:32.280 align:start position:0%
number
 
04:53:36.288 --> 04:53:36.298 align:start position:0%
no I I don't think so because again
 
04:53:39.350 --> 04:53:39.360 align:start position:0%
those things are guesses right humans
 
04:53:42.288 --> 04:53:42.298 align:start position:0%
made those guesses and so uh they
 
04:53:46.010 --> 04:53:46.020 align:start position:0%
guessed wrong in some sense in 2007.
 
04:53:47.628 --> 04:53:47.638 align:start position:0%
well they were they were very wrong
 
04:53:49.490 --> 04:53:49.500 align:start position:0%
about the rate of return particularly
 
04:53:52.490 --> 04:53:52.500 align:start position:0%
for the next year yeah and so
 
04:53:56.570 --> 04:53:56.580 align:start position:0%
that's my point is my question is I'm
 
04:53:59.628 --> 04:53:59.638 align:start position:0%
sorry the unfunded accrued liability
 
04:54:02.628 --> 04:54:02.638 align:start position:0%
back in 2007 using if we if we used
 
04:54:04.788 --> 04:54:04.798 align:start position:0%
eight percent today for the unfunded
 
04:54:06.890 --> 04:54:06.900 align:start position:0%
accrued liability figure it wouldn't be
 
04:54:08.750 --> 04:54:08.760 align:start position:0%
what it is in this chart so you cannot
 
04:54:10.368 --> 04:54:10.378 align:start position:0%
compare the two because the numbers were
 
04:54:11.990 --> 04:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
not the same at the
 
04:54:12.000 --> 04:54:13.750 align:start position:0%
not the same at the
correct

04:54:13.750 --> 04:54:13.760 align:start position:0%
correct
 
04:54:18.650 --> 04:54:18.660 align:start position:0%
yes thank you all right but anyway I
 
04:54:23.570 --> 04:54:23.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:25.970 --> 04:54:25.980 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
04:54:30.590 --> 04:54:30.600 align:start position:0%
so let's say that we adopted this
 
04:54:32.930 --> 04:54:32.940 align:start position:0%
this concept this idea we changed it
 
04:54:32.940 --> 04:54:35.628 align:start position:0%
this concept this idea we changed it
over

04:54:35.628 --> 04:54:35.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:38.270 --> 04:54:38.280 align:start position:0%
how long would it take for us to Trail
 
04:54:42.170 --> 04:54:42.180 align:start position:0%
this off or at least steady it
 
04:54:46.490 --> 04:54:46.500 align:start position:0%
with the current retire retirement plan
 
04:54:50.030 --> 04:54:50.040 align:start position:0%
and then implementing the new one thank
 
04:54:51.910 --> 04:54:51.920 align:start position:0%
you for the question so first of all
 
04:54:56.270 --> 04:54:56.280 align:start position:0%
this bill has nothing to do with how we
 
04:54:59.090 --> 04:54:59.100 align:start position:0%
pay off the current unfunded liability
 
04:55:01.850 --> 04:55:01.860 align:start position:0%
so the current unfunded liability would
 
04:55:04.010 --> 04:55:04.020 align:start position:0%
still be paid in the same way you'd need
 
04:55:05.390 --> 04:55:05.400 align:start position:0%
a new bill if you wanted to change that
 
04:55:07.670 --> 04:55:07.680 align:start position:0%
but it's it's still be paid off in the
 
04:55:10.190 --> 04:55:10.200 align:start position:0%
same way the same percentage of
 
04:55:12.050 --> 04:55:12.060 align:start position:0%
employees salaries including these
 
04:55:14.990 --> 04:55:15.000 align:start position:0%
employees in in group three all that
 
04:55:17.510 --> 04:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
that that would go the same what would
 
04:55:18.830 --> 04:55:18.840 align:start position:0%
happen is
 
04:55:21.650 --> 04:55:21.660 align:start position:0%
for the group three employees
 
04:55:24.708 --> 04:55:24.718 align:start position:0%
we would never be in trouble there would
 
04:55:27.730 --> 04:55:27.740 align:start position:0%
never be any unfunded liability for them
 
04:55:30.230 --> 04:55:30.240 align:start position:0%
compared to group one and group two
 
04:55:32.930 --> 04:55:32.940 align:start position:0%
employees so to the extent that there's
 
04:55:35.570 --> 04:55:35.580 align:start position:0%
fewer group one employees and more group
 
04:55:37.690 --> 04:55:37.700 align:start position:0%
three employees
 
04:55:41.390 --> 04:55:41.400 align:start position:0%
we have less problems in the future
 
04:55:46.128 --> 04:55:46.138 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:49.128 --> 04:55:49.138 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:52.310 --> 04:55:52.320 align:start position:0%
I think my my point is with these graphs
 
04:55:56.990 --> 04:55:57.000 align:start position:0%
of how it's it's going up tremendously
 
04:55:59.270 --> 04:55:59.280 align:start position:0%
and it was guesswork
 
04:56:02.030 --> 04:56:02.040 align:start position:0%
my point is that if we were to implement
 
04:56:03.830 --> 04:56:03.840 align:start position:0%
this plan at some point this starts to
 
04:56:06.770 --> 04:56:06.780 align:start position:0%
study as the group threes coming in all
 
04:56:09.350 --> 04:56:09.360 align:start position:0%
new employees coming into the state
 
04:56:13.190 --> 04:56:13.200 align:start position:0%
right as as the retirement for group
 
04:56:15.530 --> 04:56:15.540 align:start position:0%
group A and B start to to tick off
 
04:56:18.288 --> 04:56:18.298 align:start position:0%
that's I just wanted to clarify my
 
04:56:19.368 --> 04:56:19.378 align:start position:0%
question but I don't think you can
 
04:56:20.868 --> 04:56:20.878 align:start position:0%
answer it at this point in time we
 
04:56:22.850 --> 04:56:22.860 align:start position:0%
probably can't answer it but it's it
 
04:56:25.910 --> 04:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
okay let me all right let me try to be a
 
04:56:27.170 --> 04:56:27.180 align:start position:0%
little more detail
 
04:56:30.708 --> 04:56:30.718 align:start position:0%
presumably so we think that we are
 
04:56:32.930 --> 04:56:32.940 align:start position:0%
currently paying so we currently pay
 
04:56:36.350 --> 04:56:36.360 align:start position:0%
over 20 of someone's salary toward the
 
04:56:38.270 --> 04:56:38.280 align:start position:0%
retirement system that's what's going
 
04:56:40.190 --> 04:56:40.200 align:start position:0%
into the retirement system for group one
 
04:56:44.750 --> 04:56:44.760 align:start position:0%
all right of that money 10.7 percent is
 
04:56:47.930 --> 04:56:47.940 align:start position:0%
to pay off the the 5.7 billion unfunded
 
04:56:51.230 --> 04:56:51.240 align:start position:0%
liability and 9.3 percent or nine
 
04:56:54.110 --> 04:56:54.120 align:start position:0%
whatever the other the rest is is going
 
04:56:59.530 --> 04:56:59.540 align:start position:0%
for that employee's own benefits Okay so
 
04:57:02.750 --> 04:57:02.760 align:start position:0%
that yeah that's actually not correct
 
04:57:04.788 --> 04:57:04.798 align:start position:0%
the amount that's going toward the
 
04:57:07.970 --> 04:57:07.980 align:start position:0%
currently earned benefits is about two
 
04:57:09.770 --> 04:57:09.780 align:start position:0%
and a half percent isn't it
 
04:57:21.230 --> 04:57:21.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:23.510 --> 04:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
yeah so what I'm talking about is the
 
04:57:26.390 --> 04:57:26.400 align:start position:0%
total amount of funds going in right now
 
04:57:30.170 --> 04:57:30.180 align:start position:0%
from the employee seven percent is going
 
04:57:34.250 --> 04:57:34.260 align:start position:0%
in that is completely assigned to that
 
04:57:39.050 --> 04:57:39.060 align:start position:0%
employee's own benefits okay and from
 
04:57:41.868 --> 04:57:41.878 align:start position:0%
the employer two and a half percent is
 
04:57:44.330 --> 04:57:44.340 align:start position:0%
going in for that employee's own benefit
 
04:57:46.570 --> 04:57:46.580 align:start position:0%
so roughly nine and a half percent okay
 
04:57:51.110 --> 04:57:51.120 align:start position:0%
the other 10.79 going in is to pay off
 
04:57:55.070 --> 04:57:55.080 align:start position:0%
the unfunded liability and so this bill
 
04:57:58.070 --> 04:57:58.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't change that it doesn't
 
04:58:01.850 --> 04:58:01.860 align:start position:0%
it just redirects that nine points Point
 
04:58:07.250 --> 04:58:07.260 align:start position:0%
uh uh nine and a half to group three for
 
04:58:09.948 --> 04:58:09.958 align:start position:0%
their own benefits their own benefits
 
04:58:11.750 --> 04:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
will be calculated in a different way
 
04:58:15.590 --> 04:58:15.600 align:start position:0%
it's their own savings but the the 10.79
 
04:58:19.128 --> 04:58:19.138 align:start position:0%
going to pay off the past that's the
 
04:58:21.770 --> 04:58:21.780 align:start position:0%
same and unchanged okay
 
04:58:26.150 --> 04:58:26.160 align:start position:0%
should I continue representative Schmidt
 
04:58:30.350 --> 04:58:30.360 align:start position:0%
thank you so I'm a little bit confused
 
04:58:33.170 --> 04:58:33.180 align:start position:0%
but that's pretty normal
 
04:58:36.050 --> 04:58:36.060 align:start position:0%
um so the thing is that if you are
 
04:58:39.708 --> 04:58:39.718 align:start position:0%
taking a a crop of new employees would
 
04:58:41.810 --> 04:58:41.820 align:start position:0%
ordinarily be putting their
 
04:58:45.050 --> 04:58:45.060 align:start position:0%
their share and this state share into
 
04:58:49.430 --> 04:58:49.440 align:start position:0%
the current system to take them away
 
04:58:51.530 --> 04:58:51.540 align:start position:0%
they're going to be in a separate
 
04:58:51.540 --> 04:58:53.948 align:start position:0%
they're going to be in a separate
situation

04:58:53.948 --> 04:58:53.958 align:start position:0%
situation
 
04:58:56.510 --> 04:58:56.520 align:start position:0%
then you don't have a
 
04:58:59.750 --> 04:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
a fresh group of employees contributing
 
04:59:03.410 --> 04:59:03.420 align:start position:0%
to the current situation as I understand
 
04:59:06.770 --> 04:59:06.780 align:start position:0%
it and not quite no yeah I suppose is
 
04:59:08.570 --> 04:59:08.580 align:start position:0%
there something wrong there because yes
 
04:59:11.570 --> 04:59:11.580 align:start position:0%
to agree that you don't have like with
 
04:59:14.448 --> 04:59:14.458 align:start position:0%
Social Security current payers or
 
04:59:18.050 --> 04:59:18.060 align:start position:0%
funding I understand retirees yes thank
 
04:59:20.868 --> 04:59:20.878 align:start position:0%
you for the question so so when we
 
04:59:24.230 --> 04:59:24.240 align:start position:0%
calculate who's paying how much we owe
 
04:59:27.110 --> 04:59:27.120 align:start position:0%
for the unfunded liability we include
 
04:59:29.810 --> 04:59:29.820 align:start position:0%
everybody group one group two group
 
04:59:34.850 --> 04:59:34.860 align:start position:0%
three okay all that we calculate how
 
04:59:36.650 --> 04:59:36.660 align:start position:0%
much we have to pay to the unfunded
 
04:59:39.230 --> 04:59:39.240 align:start position:0%
liability and there's a surcharge
 
04:59:43.610 --> 04:59:43.620 align:start position:0%
currently 10.79 on group ones that goes
 
04:59:47.090 --> 04:59:47.100 align:start position:0%
into unfunded liability okay
 
04:59:50.510 --> 04:59:50.520 align:start position:0%
so that's that's the past that's paying
 
04:59:52.730 --> 04:59:52.740 align:start position:0%
off the past so it's everybody paying
 
04:59:54.530 --> 04:59:54.540 align:start position:0%
off the past in some sense including the
 
04:59:56.390 --> 04:59:56.400 align:start position:0%
new people including the new people yes
 
05:00:00.530 --> 05:00:00.540 align:start position:0%
okay but the new people their savings
 
05:00:04.010 --> 05:00:04.020 align:start position:0%
for themselves is different right
 
05:00:06.470 --> 05:00:06.480 align:start position:0%
compared to you gotcha okay thanks okay
 
05:00:08.868 --> 05:00:08.878 align:start position:0%
other questions at this point
 
05:00:11.270 --> 05:00:11.280 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you
 
05:00:11.280 --> 05:00:12.470 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you
um

05:00:12.470 --> 05:00:12.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:00:15.170 --> 05:00:15.180 align:start position:0%
all right now the other the other
 
05:00:18.708 --> 05:00:18.718 align:start position:0%
drawback for employers so why in a sense
 
05:00:22.150 --> 05:00:22.160 align:start position:0%
the trouble we're in now is because
 
05:00:26.990 --> 05:00:27.000 align:start position:0%
people worked for us and earned benefits
 
05:00:30.230 --> 05:00:30.240 align:start position:0%
20 years ago 15 years ago whatever and
 
05:00:31.970 --> 05:00:31.980 align:start position:0%
we didn't pay enough for their
 
05:00:31.980 --> 05:00:33.170 align:start position:0%
we didn't pay enough for their
compensation

05:00:33.170 --> 05:00:33.180 align:start position:0%
compensation
 
05:00:35.270 --> 05:00:35.280 align:start position:0%
right they earned a salary they earned
 
05:00:38.510 --> 05:00:38.520 align:start position:0%
benefits and we didn't at that time pay
 
05:00:42.170 --> 05:00:42.180 align:start position:0%
enough which means those past taxpayers
 
05:00:44.750 --> 05:00:44.760 align:start position:0%
paid too little for the work that they
 
05:00:47.770 --> 05:00:47.780 align:start position:0%
got in exchange right so today's
 
05:00:51.110 --> 05:00:51.120 align:start position:0%
taxpayers have to pay for today's
 
05:00:55.070 --> 05:00:55.080 align:start position:0%
employees and the amount that past
 
05:00:55.080 --> 05:00:56.570 align:start position:0%
employees and the amount that past
taxpayers

05:00:56.570 --> 05:00:56.580 align:start position:0%
taxpayers
 
05:01:01.368 --> 05:01:01.378 align:start position:0%
didn't pay and and so the problem is the
 
05:01:03.770 --> 05:01:03.780 align:start position:0%
longer we draw that out
 
05:01:06.590 --> 05:01:06.600 align:start position:0%
the the worse the situation is because
 
05:01:10.970 --> 05:01:10.980 align:start position:0%
because today's taxpayers are are more
 
05:01:13.490 --> 05:01:13.500 align:start position:0%
and more removed from the work that was
 
05:01:15.708 --> 05:01:15.718 align:start position:0%
done in the past you see what I mean so
 
05:01:18.050 --> 05:01:18.060 align:start position:0%
so we need to pay things off as quickly
 
05:01:22.070 --> 05:01:22.080 align:start position:0%
as possible and just as an aside
 
05:01:24.650 --> 05:01:24.660 align:start position:0%
um I don't see uh representative O'Brien
 
05:01:28.368 --> 05:01:28.378 align:start position:0%
here but today okay well his bill to pay
 
05:01:30.350 --> 05:01:30.360 align:start position:0%
the seven and a half percent
 
05:01:30.360 --> 05:01:31.730 align:start position:0%
the seven and a half percent
Etc

05:01:31.730 --> 05:01:31.740 align:start position:0%
Etc
 
05:01:35.090 --> 05:01:35.100 align:start position:0%
um in committee I switched that to take
 
05:01:38.030 --> 05:01:38.040 align:start position:0%
that same money and pay off the unfunded
 
05:01:41.150 --> 05:01:41.160 align:start position:0%
liability right because we want to pay
 
05:01:43.610 --> 05:01:43.620 align:start position:0%
off that unfunded liability as quickly
 
05:01:47.150 --> 05:01:47.160 align:start position:0%
as possible and and and connect today's
 
05:01:50.570 --> 05:01:50.580 align:start position:0%
taxpayers with today's employees right
 
05:01:53.690 --> 05:01:53.700 align:start position:0%
so that what you know you're paying
 
05:01:55.990 --> 05:01:56.000 align:start position:0%
today for the work you received today
 
05:01:58.788 --> 05:01:58.798 align:start position:0%
that that that's a good principle I
 
05:02:01.128 --> 05:02:01.138 align:start position:0%
think okay all right that's that's it
 
05:02:02.750 --> 05:02:02.760 align:start position:0%
for defined benefit now let's talk about
 
05:02:05.810 --> 05:02:05.820 align:start position:0%
the find country abusion plans okay we
 
05:02:07.368 --> 05:02:07.378 align:start position:0%
already said a few of these things I'll
 
05:02:08.690 --> 05:02:08.700 align:start position:0%
go quickly
 
05:02:10.610 --> 05:02:10.620 align:start position:0%
um it's better positioned to keep up
 
05:02:13.730 --> 05:02:13.740 align:start position:0%
with inflation right because it's not a
 
05:02:16.490 --> 05:02:16.500 align:start position:0%
formula it's not fixed income it's it's
 
05:02:19.850 --> 05:02:19.860 align:start position:0%
income based on investments so you have
 
05:02:22.128 --> 05:02:22.138 align:start position:0%
at least some chance of keeping up with
 
05:02:24.650 --> 05:02:24.660 align:start position:0%
inflation if you owned real estate if
 
05:02:26.628 --> 05:02:26.638 align:start position:0%
you own stocks if you own things like
 
05:02:28.610 --> 05:02:28.620 align:start position:0%
that those things tend to rise with
 
05:02:31.610 --> 05:02:31.620 align:start position:0%
inflation so you you you can maybe keep
 
05:02:31.620 --> 05:02:32.690 align:start position:0%
inflation so you you you can maybe keep
up

05:02:32.690 --> 05:02:32.700 align:start position:0%
up
 
05:02:35.628 --> 05:02:35.638 align:start position:0%
okay it's portable it has immediate
 
05:02:37.550 --> 05:02:37.560 align:start position:0%
vesting you earn you earn something
 
05:02:40.490 --> 05:02:40.500 align:start position:0%
today it's yours you take it with you if
 
05:02:42.410 --> 05:02:42.420 align:start position:0%
you leave in two years or one year or
 
05:02:44.628 --> 05:02:44.638 align:start position:0%
three years it's yours you put it in
 
05:02:46.430 --> 05:02:46.440 align:start position:0%
your IRA or you keep it in the plan
 
05:02:49.368 --> 05:02:49.378 align:start position:0%
however you want to do it okay it's
 
05:02:51.830 --> 05:02:51.840 align:start position:0%
inheritable if somebody dies in a car
 
05:02:56.270 --> 05:02:56.280 align:start position:0%
crash there uh that money that's their
 
05:02:59.090 --> 05:02:59.100 align:start position:0%
own savings goes to their errors right
 
05:03:01.010 --> 05:03:01.020 align:start position:0%
it doesn't go to other employees it's
 
05:03:03.110 --> 05:03:03.120 align:start position:0%
not insurance
 
05:03:03.120 --> 05:03:04.010 align:start position:0%
not insurance
um

05:03:04.010 --> 05:03:04.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:03:06.530 --> 05:03:06.540 align:start position:0%
uh employees can customize their
 
05:03:10.190 --> 05:03:10.200 align:start position:0%
Investments to their own liking and this
 
05:03:13.670 --> 05:03:13.680 align:start position:0%
is also important it's reality okay
 
05:03:18.050 --> 05:03:18.060 align:start position:0%
because in the current system
 
05:03:20.868 --> 05:03:20.878 align:start position:0%
you earn your most benef your most
 
05:03:23.330 --> 05:03:23.340 align:start position:0%
benefits happen based on what you do
 
05:03:25.190 --> 05:03:25.200 align:start position:0%
late in your career
 
05:03:27.948 --> 05:03:27.958 align:start position:0%
right if late in your career you get a
 
05:03:29.510 --> 05:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
big increase or you work a lot of
 
05:03:32.030 --> 05:03:32.040 align:start position:0%
overtime or something like that that
 
05:03:34.010 --> 05:03:34.020 align:start position:0%
makes a big jump in the in your
 
05:03:36.288 --> 05:03:36.298 align:start position:0%
retirement pay or you work a few more
 
05:03:38.090 --> 05:03:38.100 align:start position:0%
years that makes a big jump in your
 
05:03:40.788 --> 05:03:40.798 align:start position:0%
retirement pay but the amount in the
 
05:03:43.490 --> 05:03:43.500 align:start position:0%
system that you contributed you and your
 
05:03:46.970 --> 05:03:46.980 align:start position:0%
employer contributed comes early
 
05:03:49.368 --> 05:03:49.378 align:start position:0%
right the early dollars are the most
 
05:03:51.530 --> 05:03:51.540 align:start position:0%
important dollars because those grow for
 
05:03:54.770 --> 05:03:54.780 align:start position:0%
40 years right the late dollars
 
05:03:56.868 --> 05:03:56.878 align:start position:0%
are not as important right they're just
 
05:03:59.270 --> 05:03:59.280 align:start position:0%
there right away and so
 
05:04:01.730 --> 05:04:01.740 align:start position:0%
the the so because of that disconnect
 
05:04:04.670 --> 05:04:04.680 align:start position:0%
people have the wrong incentives for how
 
05:04:05.868 --> 05:04:05.878 align:start position:0%
they save
 
05:04:07.430 --> 05:04:07.440 align:start position:0%
right whereas with a defined
 
05:04:09.350 --> 05:04:09.360 align:start position:0%
contribution plan
 
05:04:12.590 --> 05:04:12.600 align:start position:0%
people know they they feel that they're
 
05:04:15.948 --> 05:04:15.958 align:start position:0%
early dollars are the most important so
 
05:04:18.530 --> 05:04:18.540 align:start position:0%
so they have a good incentive to do the
 
05:04:21.590 --> 05:04:21.600 align:start position:0%
right thing which is which is save early
 
05:04:24.410 --> 05:04:24.420 align:start position:0%
in your career because you're going to
 
05:04:28.128 --> 05:04:28.138 align:start position:0%
get 40 Years of growth right so that
 
05:04:30.708 --> 05:04:30.718 align:start position:0%
that's what I wanted to say all right
 
05:04:30.718 --> 05:04:31.610 align:start position:0%
that's what I wanted to say all right
um

05:04:31.610 --> 05:04:31.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:04:34.310 --> 05:04:34.320 align:start position:0%
so it can't go into debt so the defined
 
05:04:36.610 --> 05:04:36.620 align:start position:0%
contribution plan you paid today
 
05:04:39.050 --> 05:04:39.060 align:start position:0%
the expenses just like paying for
 
05:04:41.270 --> 05:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
medical expenses and other expenses you
 
05:04:43.730 --> 05:04:43.740 align:start position:0%
pay pension it goes into their plan it's
 
05:04:45.708 --> 05:04:45.718 align:start position:0%
it's done today
 
05:04:45.718 --> 05:04:46.910 align:start position:0%
it's done today
and

05:04:46.910 --> 05:04:46.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:04:46.920 --> 05:04:48.530 align:start position:0%
and
um

05:04:48.530 --> 05:04:48.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:04:51.350 --> 05:04:51.360 align:start position:0%
yeah so uh it's fully funded by today's
 
05:04:53.990 --> 05:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
taxpayers okay that's that's it for that
 
05:04:55.670 --> 05:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
section on defined contribution anybody
 
05:04:58.550 --> 05:04:58.560 align:start position:0%
have questions about what a defining
 
05:05:01.250 --> 05:05:01.260 align:start position:0%
contribution plan is all right good and
 
05:05:03.830 --> 05:05:03.840 align:start position:0%
then the bill itself so again we're just
 
05:05:06.470 --> 05:05:06.480 align:start position:0%
starting with a very small group now
 
05:05:09.590 --> 05:05:09.600 align:start position:0%
personally I think that group two
 
05:05:12.830 --> 05:05:12.840 align:start position:0%
employees would benefit the most from
 
05:05:16.010 --> 05:05:16.020 align:start position:0%
this kind of a plan why because they're
 
05:05:17.570 --> 05:05:17.580 align:start position:0%
going to be retired for the they're
 
05:05:19.490 --> 05:05:19.500 align:start position:0%
going to collect for the longest period
 
05:05:21.530 --> 05:05:21.540 align:start position:0%
of time so if you're going to collect
 
05:05:23.570 --> 05:05:23.580 align:start position:0%
for 30 years
 
05:05:25.310 --> 05:05:25.320 align:start position:0%
you're you
 
05:05:27.948 --> 05:05:27.958 align:start position:0%
inflation hurts you more
 
05:05:30.948 --> 05:05:30.958 align:start position:0%
than if you collect for 10 years or 20
 
05:05:33.470 --> 05:05:33.480 align:start position:0%
years you see what I mean so so
 
05:05:36.890 --> 05:05:36.900 align:start position:0%
logically group two employees are the
 
05:05:39.590 --> 05:05:39.600 align:start position:0%
ones that should most ones yeah all
 
05:05:41.390 --> 05:05:41.400 align:start position:0%
right sorry about that all right but in
 
05:05:43.730 --> 05:05:43.740 align:start position:0%
any case it this is a very small group
 
05:05:45.890 --> 05:05:45.900 align:start position:0%
it's group one employees who work for
 
05:05:47.570 --> 05:05:47.580 align:start position:0%
the state
 
05:05:49.788 --> 05:05:49.798 align:start position:0%
um and are new brand new they've never
 
05:05:52.310 --> 05:05:52.320 align:start position:0%
been in group one okay
 
05:05:54.948 --> 05:05:54.958 align:start position:0%
um it has the exact same cost to the
 
05:05:58.250 --> 05:05:58.260 align:start position:0%
employee and the employer as group one
 
05:06:00.708 --> 05:06:00.718 align:start position:0%
um the the contributions go into our
 
05:06:03.470 --> 05:06:03.480 align:start position:0%
plan the 457 plan that we've had for a
 
05:06:05.270 --> 05:06:05.280 align:start position:0%
long long time
 
05:06:07.730 --> 05:06:07.740 align:start position:0%
um it works well and
 
05:06:09.410 --> 05:06:09.420 align:start position:0%
um we still paying the unfunded
 
05:06:12.050 --> 05:06:12.060 align:start position:0%
liability and
 
05:06:12.060 --> 05:06:12.830 align:start position:0%
liability and
um

05:06:12.830 --> 05:06:12.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:06:15.410 --> 05:06:15.420 align:start position:0%
oh and the expenses of the start there's
 
05:06:17.750 --> 05:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
going to be some startup expenses and
 
05:06:19.670 --> 05:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
the bill will
 
05:06:23.330 --> 05:06:23.340 align:start position:0%
um put that into the general fund so so
 
05:06:26.628 --> 05:06:26.638 align:start position:0%
um the general fund will will pay the
 
05:06:29.570 --> 05:06:29.580 align:start position:0%
initial startup expenses I hope that got
 
05:06:31.368 --> 05:06:31.378 align:start position:0%
into the amendment but I I didn't I
 
05:06:33.590 --> 05:06:33.600 align:start position:0%
wasn't able to check okay any questions
 
05:06:34.730 --> 05:06:34.740 align:start position:0%
about that
 
05:06:36.948 --> 05:06:36.958 align:start position:0%
um representative lycus is going to talk
 
05:06:38.330 --> 05:06:38.340 align:start position:0%
about the bill in more General more
 
05:06:41.390 --> 05:06:41.400 align:start position:0%
detail okay all right personal note so
 
05:06:44.750 --> 05:06:44.760 align:start position:0%
what I'm suggesting for the state is
 
05:06:47.390 --> 05:06:47.400 align:start position:0%
what I myself have
 
05:06:51.470 --> 05:06:51.480 align:start position:0%
okay and what the state has now is what
 
05:06:55.250 --> 05:06:55.260 align:start position:0%
my wife has okay so I know personally
 
05:06:58.670 --> 05:06:58.680 align:start position:0%
very much what's going on here
 
05:07:01.550 --> 05:07:01.560 align:start position:0%
and I can say personally so my first job
 
05:07:04.030 --> 05:07:04.040 align:start position:0%
I I started work in
 
05:07:06.530 --> 05:07:06.540 align:start position:0%
1986. my first job was for the
 
05:07:09.050 --> 05:07:09.060 align:start position:0%
University of California
 
05:07:11.510 --> 05:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
um so it was a state state employee in
 
05:07:14.930 --> 05:07:14.940 align:start position:0%
some sense and I have a 403 b which is
 
05:07:17.510 --> 05:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
the same thing as this
 
05:07:19.190 --> 05:07:19.200 align:start position:0%
um and
 
05:07:22.430 --> 05:07:22.440 align:start position:0%
it's a fantastic plan I have a lot of
 
05:07:24.830 --> 05:07:24.840 align:start position:0%
money in that plan you know I work for a
 
05:07:28.070 --> 05:07:28.080 align:start position:0%
short period of time but because it was
 
05:07:31.190 --> 05:07:31.200 align:start position:0%
40 well 30 something years ago it's
 
05:07:33.890 --> 05:07:33.900 align:start position:0%
grown tremendously right so I have a
 
05:07:37.670 --> 05:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
very from that a comfortable retirement
 
05:07:40.128 --> 05:07:40.138 align:start position:0%
your chair on the other hand worked for
 
05:07:42.110 --> 05:07:42.120 align:start position:0%
two different companies that had defined
 
05:07:43.670 --> 05:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
benefit plans
 
05:07:46.550 --> 05:07:46.560 align:start position:0%
and she worked for I don't know 10 years
 
05:07:48.170 --> 05:07:48.180 align:start position:0%
for one and 13 years for the other
 
05:07:51.770 --> 05:07:51.780 align:start position:0%
something like that and and her because
 
05:07:53.390 --> 05:07:53.400 align:start position:0%
there are two different companies two
 
05:07:55.550 --> 05:07:55.560 align:start position:0%
different plans so she doesn't get the
 
05:07:58.010 --> 05:07:58.020 align:start position:0%
advantage of the high income times 20
 
05:08:00.530 --> 05:08:00.540 align:start position:0%
years she has the high income times 10
 
05:08:02.990 --> 05:08:03.000 align:start position:0%
years and a low income times 10 years
 
05:08:06.590 --> 05:08:06.600 align:start position:0%
right but overall even that I worked for
 
05:08:09.770 --> 05:08:09.780 align:start position:0%
fewer years than she did and my benefits
 
05:08:13.368 --> 05:08:13.378 align:start position:0%
are much higher than hers okay so it's a
 
05:08:16.128 --> 05:08:16.138 align:start position:0%
good plan I know it personally because
 
05:08:20.150 --> 05:08:20.160 align:start position:0%
because I see it in my own family okay
 
05:08:20.160 --> 05:08:21.230 align:start position:0%
because I see it in my own family okay
um

05:08:21.230 --> 05:08:21.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:08:23.868 --> 05:08:23.878 align:start position:0%
all right I guess that's enough for me
 
05:08:25.910 --> 05:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
the other questions representative
 
05:08:25.920 --> 05:08:27.590 align:start position:0%
the other questions representative
Fitzpatrick

05:08:27.590 --> 05:08:27.600 align:start position:0%
Fitzpatrick
 
05:08:30.350 --> 05:08:30.360 align:start position:0%
I I too am
 
05:08:30.360 --> 05:08:31.910 align:start position:0%
I I too am
intimately

05:08:31.910 --> 05:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
intimately
 
05:08:34.788 --> 05:08:34.798 align:start position:0%
familiar with both types of plans and I
 
05:08:34.798 --> 05:08:36.050 align:start position:0%
familiar with both types of plans and I
took

05:08:36.050 --> 05:08:36.060 align:start position:0%
took
 
05:08:39.730 --> 05:08:39.740 align:start position:0%
um a recipient of a deposit defined
 
05:08:42.530 --> 05:08:42.540 align:start position:0%
contribution plan and I understand their
 
05:08:44.510 --> 05:08:44.520 align:start position:0%
their benefits
 
05:08:47.390 --> 05:08:47.400 align:start position:0%
and I'm I'm familiar with cities in the
 
05:08:50.270 --> 05:08:50.280 align:start position:0%
country that have switched as as this
 
05:08:52.030 --> 05:08:52.040 align:start position:0%
committee may not know there are many
 
05:08:56.030 --> 05:08:56.040 align:start position:0%
cities throughout the U.S that have
 
05:08:58.550 --> 05:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
their own Retirement Systems separate
 
05:09:02.570 --> 05:09:02.580 align:start position:0%
from a state one and uh I'm thinking of
 
05:09:05.570 --> 05:09:05.580 align:start position:0%
the city of Troy Michigan for instance
 
05:09:09.650 --> 05:09:09.660 align:start position:0%
uh and when Troy Michigan switched they
 
05:09:13.010 --> 05:09:13.020 align:start position:0%
also offered their employees who were in
 
05:09:15.590 --> 05:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
their defined benefit plan
 
05:09:19.570 --> 05:09:19.580 align:start position:0%
to take their action their actual aerial
 
05:09:25.368 --> 05:09:25.378 align:start position:0%
benefit and transfer it to the to then
 
05:09:26.708 --> 05:09:26.718 align:start position:0%
it was
 
05:09:29.390 --> 05:09:29.400 align:start position:0%
icmarc which is the international City
 
05:09:30.890 --> 05:09:30.900 align:start position:0%
County management association's
 
05:09:33.050 --> 05:09:33.060 align:start position:0%
retirement Corporation and they run a
 
05:09:36.110 --> 05:09:36.120 align:start position:0%
401a program uh is there any
 
05:09:40.910 --> 05:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
consideration for for that a program uh
 
05:09:44.090 --> 05:09:44.100 align:start position:0%
for this Bill thank you for the question
 
05:09:48.830 --> 05:09:48.840 align:start position:0%
um sort of the bill forces new state
 
05:09:52.010 --> 05:09:52.020 align:start position:0%
group one employees into this plan right
 
05:09:56.150 --> 05:09:56.160 align:start position:0%
it allows other group one employees to
 
05:09:59.208 --> 05:09:59.218 align:start position:0%
effectively quit and take what they
 
05:10:02.390 --> 05:10:02.400 align:start position:0%
would get out of group one and put it in
 
05:10:05.150 --> 05:10:05.160 align:start position:0%
this plan and continue in this plan if
 
05:10:07.610 --> 05:10:07.620 align:start position:0%
they prefer that so yes there's there's
 
05:10:10.250 --> 05:10:10.260 align:start position:0%
a little bit of an option that way and I
 
05:10:13.490 --> 05:10:13.500 align:start position:0%
would think that employees that that are
 
05:10:15.590 --> 05:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
fairly young right that are in their
 
05:10:17.930 --> 05:10:17.940 align:start position:0%
second third year might want to do that
 
05:10:20.030 --> 05:10:20.040 align:start position:0%
those that are further along might not
 
05:10:22.730 --> 05:10:22.740 align:start position:0%
it's really up to them so okay follow up
 
05:10:25.190 --> 05:10:25.200 align:start position:0%
just one more uh has there also been any
 
05:10:26.930 --> 05:10:26.940 align:start position:0%
thought of making it optional in other
 
05:10:29.150 --> 05:10:29.160 align:start position:0%
words you have a you're still offering
 
05:10:29.160 --> 05:10:30.910 align:start position:0%
words you have a you're still offering
the

05:10:30.910 --> 05:10:30.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:10:34.490 --> 05:10:34.500 align:start position:0%
traditional defined benefit plan but a
 
05:10:37.788 --> 05:10:37.798 align:start position:0%
new employee can choose immediately into
 
05:10:40.030 --> 05:10:40.040 align:start position:0%
the defined
 
05:10:42.230 --> 05:10:42.240 align:start position:0%
contribution track
 
05:10:44.330 --> 05:10:44.340 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for the question we did
 
05:10:46.128 --> 05:10:46.138 align:start position:0%
not consider that
 
05:10:48.530 --> 05:10:48.540 align:start position:0%
um we're a little concerned about
 
05:10:51.170 --> 05:10:51.180 align:start position:0%
expenses in the sense that if the number
 
05:10:54.288 --> 05:10:54.298 align:start position:0%
of people in a plan isn't enough to pay
 
05:10:56.628 --> 05:10:56.638 align:start position:0%
the employee you need to run it et
 
05:11:01.310 --> 05:11:01.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:02.890 --> 05:11:02.900 align:start position:0%
um one other thing I'd like to point out
 
05:11:06.530 --> 05:11:06.540 align:start position:0%
the University of New Hampshire has this
 
05:11:09.050 --> 05:11:09.060 align:start position:0%
kind of a plan and has had for roughly
 
05:11:12.350 --> 05:11:12.360 align:start position:0%
25 years the financial officer of the
 
05:11:15.288 --> 05:11:15.298 align:start position:0%
university is Catherine provencher and
 
05:11:18.110 --> 05:11:18.120 align:start position:0%
if you want to she was very receptive to
 
05:11:20.448 --> 05:11:20.458 align:start position:0%
my calls and so if you want to talk to
 
05:11:22.788 --> 05:11:22.798 align:start position:0%
her about their experiences and so on
 
05:11:25.670 --> 05:11:25.680 align:start position:0%
which are all positive that would be
 
05:11:34.788 --> 05:11:34.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:37.550 --> 05:11:37.560 align:start position:0%
uh Representatives Weiler and Santa
 
05:11:41.390 --> 05:11:41.400 align:start position:0%
nastasso if you don't mind Mr Savage has
 
05:11:44.510 --> 05:11:44.520 align:start position:0%
a plane so he's got to leave early so I
 
05:11:46.670 --> 05:11:46.680 align:start position:0%
would like to call on him
 
05:11:50.750 --> 05:11:50.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much Thomas Savage I
 
05:11:54.650 --> 05:11:54.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:57.170 --> 05:11:57.180 align:start position:0%
I'd be I'd be happy to pass those around
 
05:11:59.690 --> 05:11:59.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:02.330 --> 05:12:02.340 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
05:12:10.788 --> 05:12:10.798 align:start position:0%

yes and uh since you're giving us your
 
05:12:14.628 --> 05:12:14.638 align:start position:0%
written testimony you don't need to read
 
05:12:16.490 --> 05:12:16.500 align:start position:0%
it just give us the highlights certainly
 
05:12:18.110 --> 05:12:18.120 align:start position:0%

um you know this topic is of such
 
05:12:27.410 --> 05:12:27.420 align:start position:0%
interest to Alec because
 
05:12:29.868 --> 05:12:29.878 align:start position:0%
um unfunded pension liabilities and the
 
05:12:31.730 --> 05:12:31.740 align:start position:0%
rapid growth of unfunded pension
 
05:12:35.448 --> 05:12:35.458 align:start position:0%
liabilities is of great concern across
 
05:12:36.368 --> 05:12:36.378 align:start position:0%
the country
 
05:12:39.948 --> 05:12:39.958 align:start position:0%
so we're here today to offer
 
05:12:43.368 --> 05:12:43.378 align:start position:0%
um an education to offer and educate
 
05:12:45.708 --> 05:12:45.718 align:start position:0%
um on some of our pension research which
 
05:12:48.948 --> 05:12:48.958 align:start position:0%
is published annually in a report titled
 
05:12:51.890 --> 05:12:51.900 align:start position:0%
unaccountable and unaffordable and that
 
05:12:54.708 --> 05:12:54.718 align:start position:0%
is uh publicly available on our website
 
05:12:56.448 --> 05:12:56.458 align:start position:0%
I'm here today excuse me could you
 
05:12:58.190 --> 05:12:58.200 align:start position:0%

05:13:06.530 --> 05:13:06.540 align:start position:0%
the American legislative exchange
 
05:13:08.750 --> 05:13:08.760 align:start position:0%
Council or Alec

um for those of you who don't know Alec
 
05:13:13.128 --> 05:13:13.138 align:start position:0%
is the nation's largest nonpartisan
 
05:13:15.110 --> 05:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
voluntary membership organization of
 
05:13:16.490 --> 05:13:16.500 align:start position:0%

Alec and its members are dedicated to
 
05:13:20.090 --> 05:13:20.100 align:start position:0%
advancing the principles of limited
 
05:13:22.070 --> 05:13:22.080 align:start position:0%
government free markets and federalism
 
05:13:24.590 --> 05:13:24.600 align:start position:0%
where a forum for stakeholders to
 
05:13:26.448 --> 05:13:26.458 align:start position:0%
exchange ideas and to develop real
 
05:13:28.490 --> 05:13:28.500 align:start position:0%
state-based policy solutions to
 
05:13:30.650 --> 05:13:30.660 align:start position:0%
encourage growth preserve Economic
 
05:13:32.690 --> 05:13:32.700 align:start position:0%
Security and protect hard-working
 
05:13:35.690 --> 05:13:35.700 align:start position:0%
taxpayers because of Alex focus on state
 
05:13:37.850 --> 05:13:37.860 align:start position:0%
policy ideas Alec has a wealth of
 
05:13:39.708 --> 05:13:39.718 align:start position:0%
experience analyzing state public
 
05:13:43.010 --> 05:13:43.020 align:start position:0%
Pension Plan programs and determining
 
05:13:44.750 --> 05:13:44.760 align:start position:0%
types of policies that ensure their
 
05:13:44.760 --> 05:13:46.430 align:start position:0%
types of policies that ensure their
solvency

05:13:46.430 --> 05:13:46.440 align:start position:0%
solvency
 
05:13:49.910 --> 05:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
um so the Crux of my written testimony
 
05:13:53.570 --> 05:13:53.580 align:start position:0%
today is to offer examples of pension
 
05:13:56.090 --> 05:13:56.100 align:start position:0%
reform across the country particularly
 
05:13:58.430 --> 05:13:58.440 align:start position:0%
the case studies of Alaska Michigan and
 
05:13:58.440 --> 05:13:59.330 align:start position:0%
the case studies of Alaska Michigan and
Oklahoma

05:13:59.330 --> 05:13:59.340 align:start position:0%
Oklahoma
 
05:14:02.330 --> 05:14:02.340 align:start position:0%
in 2005 Alaska passed legislation
 
05:14:04.128 --> 05:14:04.138 align:start position:0%
enrolling new state employees and
 
05:14:05.810 --> 05:14:05.820 align:start position:0%
teachers into a defined contribution
 
05:14:08.448 --> 05:14:08.458 align:start position:0%
plan a study from the reason Foundation
 
05:14:10.190 --> 05:14:10.200 align:start position:0%
found that by making these reforms
 
05:14:13.010 --> 05:14:13.020 align:start position:0%
Alaska saved over 40 million dollars
 
05:14:17.270 --> 05:14:17.280 align:start position:0%
from 2006 to 2016. the problems in
 
05:14:20.030 --> 05:14:20.040 align:start position:0%
Alaska however stem from the state not
 
05:14:22.010 --> 05:14:22.020 align:start position:0%
properly funding the closed defined
 
05:14:23.390 --> 05:14:23.400 align:start position:0%
benefit plans
 
05:14:25.610 --> 05:14:25.620 align:start position:0%
in the Years following pension reform
 
05:14:27.590 --> 05:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
the state failed to make the full
 
05:14:29.330 --> 05:14:29.340 align:start position:0%
necessary contributions to the
 
05:14:31.788 --> 05:14:31.798 align:start position:0%
closed-defined benefit plan and did not
 
05:14:33.770 --> 05:14:33.780 align:start position:0%
change its payment schedule to speed up
 
05:14:36.410 --> 05:14:36.420 align:start position:0%
paying off those liabilities the lesson
 
05:14:38.448 --> 05:14:38.458 align:start position:0%
from Alaska is that you must keep making
 
05:14:40.850 --> 05:14:40.860 align:start position:0%
the full required contributions to the
 
05:14:43.070 --> 05:14:43.080 align:start position:0%
closed defined benefit plan after
 
05:14:44.690 --> 05:14:44.700 align:start position:0%
reforms are made
 
05:14:47.448 --> 05:14:47.458 align:start position:0%
in 1996 Michigan was actually the first
 
05:14:49.310 --> 05:14:49.320 align:start position:0%
state in the nation to close its defined
 
05:14:50.990 --> 05:14:51.000 align:start position:0%
benefits state employees retirement
 
05:14:53.090 --> 05:14:53.100 align:start position:0%
system and enroll new hires in a defined
 
05:14:54.590 --> 05:14:54.600 align:start position:0%
contribution plan
 
05:14:57.050 --> 05:14:57.060 align:start position:0%
similarly the Public School Employees
 
05:15:00.490 --> 05:15:00.500 align:start position:0%
Retirement System or mipsers
 
05:15:02.628 --> 05:15:02.638 align:start position:0%
enrolled new hires in a defined
 
05:15:06.830 --> 05:15:06.840 align:start position:0%
contribution plan in 2017. the mipsers
 
05:15:09.530 --> 05:15:09.540 align:start position:0%
plan Auto enrolls new hires into into a
 
05:15:12.230 --> 05:15:12.240 align:start position:0%
defined contribution plan but new
 
05:15:13.910 --> 05:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
teachers have the choice of opting into
 
05:15:16.190 --> 05:15:16.200 align:start position:0%
a hybrid with which is a mix of a
 
05:15:17.868 --> 05:15:17.878 align:start position:0%
defined contribution and defined benefit
 
05:15:17.878 --> 05:15:19.010 align:start position:0%
defined contribution and defined benefit
plans

05:15:19.010 --> 05:15:19.020 align:start position:0%
plans
 
05:15:20.930 --> 05:15:20.940 align:start position:0%
the reforms in Michigan like in Alaska
 
05:15:23.628 --> 05:15:23.638 align:start position:0%
drastically improved plan solvency and
 
05:15:26.330 --> 05:15:26.340 align:start position:0%
saved taxpayers money a study conducted
 
05:15:28.010 --> 05:15:28.020 align:start position:0%
by Richard Dreyfus in the Mackinac
 
05:15:29.930 --> 05:15:29.940 align:start position:0%
Center found that Michigan's reforms
 
05:15:33.110 --> 05:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
saved taxpayers anywhere from 2.3
 
05:15:35.330 --> 05:15:35.340 align:start position:0%
billion dollars to 4.3 billion dollars
 
05:15:37.730 --> 05:15:37.740 align:start position:0%
in unfunded liabilities and improved
 
05:15:39.770 --> 05:15:39.780 align:start position:0%
political incentives of pension funding
 
05:15:41.570 --> 05:15:41.580 align:start position:0%
a separate study from the reason
 
05:15:44.448 --> 05:15:44.458 align:start position:0%
Foundation found that the 1996 reforms
 
05:15:46.730 --> 05:15:46.740 align:start position:0%
saved Michigan over two billion dollars
 
05:15:50.090 --> 05:15:50.100 align:start position:0%
from 1996 to 2016.
 
05:15:53.570 --> 05:15:53.580 align:start position:0%
in 2015 Oklahoma closed the defined
 
05:15:55.250 --> 05:15:55.260 align:start position:0%
benefit Public Employees Retirement
 
05:15:57.470 --> 05:15:57.480 align:start position:0%
System excuse me we're having trouble
 
05:15:59.930 --> 05:15:59.940 align:start position:0%
hearing you oh pardon me you have you
 
05:16:01.730 --> 05:16:01.740 align:start position:0%
have to be close to this Pardon Me
 
05:16:03.890 --> 05:16:03.900 align:start position:0%
microphone to fight all right
 
05:16:07.970 --> 05:16:07.980 align:start position:0%
oh I was in 2015 Oklahoma closed the
 
05:16:09.650 --> 05:16:09.660 align:start position:0%
defined benefit public employees
 
05:16:11.990 --> 05:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
retirement system and enrolled new hires
 
05:16:14.208 --> 05:16:14.218 align:start position:0%
into its defined contribution plan known
 
05:16:16.010 --> 05:16:16.020 align:start position:0%
as the Pathfinder plan
 
05:16:18.410 --> 05:16:18.420 align:start position:0%
since the recent reforms pers funding
 
05:16:20.570 --> 05:16:20.580 align:start position:0%
ratio has steadily increased year over
 
05:16:23.510 --> 05:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
year by making the necessary reforms to
 
05:16:25.910 --> 05:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
take a proactive stance towards paying
 
05:16:28.730 --> 05:16:28.740 align:start position:0%
down existing unfunded liabilities pers
 
05:16:30.770 --> 05:16:30.780 align:start position:0%
improved its funding and reduced pension
 
05:16:33.288 --> 05:16:33.298 align:start position:0%
debt at an impressive rate
 
05:16:35.930 --> 05:16:35.940 align:start position:0%
um these states show that pension reform
 
05:16:38.150 --> 05:16:38.160 align:start position:0%
is possible by transitioning new hires
 
05:16:40.490 --> 05:16:40.500 align:start position:0%
into defined contribution plans these
 
05:16:42.410 --> 05:16:42.420 align:start position:0%
States helped improve improved
 
05:16:45.050 --> 05:16:45.060 align:start position:0%
retirement system solvency and slowed
 
05:16:47.510 --> 05:16:47.520 align:start position:0%
the growth of pension debt uh once again
 
05:16:49.610 --> 05:16:49.620 align:start position:0%
Alec is grateful for the opportunity to
 
05:16:51.948 --> 05:16:51.958 align:start position:0%
testify before this committee
 
05:16:53.570 --> 05:16:53.580 align:start position:0%
and thank you all for your time and
 
05:16:55.970 --> 05:16:55.980 align:start position:0%
attention to the critical importance of
 
05:16:57.948 --> 05:16:57.958 align:start position:0%
unfunded liabilities and I'll be happy
 
05:16:59.570 --> 05:16:59.580 align:start position:0%
to take any questions
 
05:17:01.550 --> 05:17:01.560 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions from
 
05:17:04.310 --> 05:17:04.320 align:start position:0%
the committee representative Dolan thank
 
05:17:06.170 --> 05:17:06.180 align:start position:0%
you thank you thank you madam chair and
 
05:17:09.410 --> 05:17:09.420 align:start position:0%
uh this is maybe a question for
 
05:17:12.050 --> 05:17:12.060 align:start position:0%
for you or our previous speaker
 
05:17:12.060 --> 05:17:13.670 align:start position:0%
for you or our previous speaker
um

05:17:13.670 --> 05:17:13.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:17:15.470 --> 05:17:15.480 align:start position:0%
when these when these Define
 
05:17:18.770 --> 05:17:18.780 align:start position:0%
contribution plans uh are utilized by
 
05:17:21.350 --> 05:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
the employees that the I assume the
 
05:17:24.670 --> 05:17:24.680 align:start position:0%
money goes into an account somewhere
 
05:17:28.610 --> 05:17:28.620 align:start position:0%
either a private account or you know a
 
05:17:30.830 --> 05:17:30.840 align:start position:0%
private business account
 
05:17:34.610 --> 05:17:34.620 align:start position:0%
uh is that account guaranteed
 
05:17:36.830 --> 05:17:36.840 align:start position:0%
by the state
 
05:17:38.570 --> 05:17:38.580 align:start position:0%
um so it depends on the state depends on
 
05:17:40.490 --> 05:17:40.500 align:start position:0%
the plan but normally that is that money
 
05:17:43.970 --> 05:17:43.980 align:start position:0%
is put into an account like a 401k a 403
 
05:17:46.850 --> 05:17:46.860 align:start position:0%
b or 457 deferred contribution plan or a
 
05:17:46.860 --> 05:17:48.590 align:start position:0%
b or 457 deferred contribution plan or a
401a

05:17:48.590 --> 05:17:48.600 align:start position:0%
401a
 
05:17:48.600 --> 05:17:49.490 align:start position:0%
401a
um

05:17:49.490 --> 05:17:49.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:17:51.948 --> 05:17:51.958 align:start position:0%
but yeah that money is uh locked in
 
05:17:55.128 --> 05:17:55.138 align:start position:0%
there it is the employees money and in
 
05:17:58.670 --> 05:17:58.680 align:start position:0%
some cases the state will offer to match
 
05:18:00.948 --> 05:18:00.958 align:start position:0%
the employees contribution up to a
 
05:18:03.110 --> 05:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
certain percentage but yeah once the
 
05:18:05.208 --> 05:18:05.218 align:start position:0%
money is in that account it belongs
 
05:18:07.788 --> 05:18:07.798 align:start position:0%
entirely to the employee and
 
05:18:11.390 --> 05:18:11.400 align:start position:0%
um no one else can touch it yes and the
 
05:18:13.910 --> 05:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
state does not necessarily guarantee the
 
05:18:16.490 --> 05:18:16.500 align:start position:0%
performance if so if the employee makes
 
05:18:18.590 --> 05:18:18.600 align:start position:0%
poor choices
 
05:18:20.570 --> 05:18:20.580 align:start position:0%
that happens I think in more of the
 
05:18:22.910 --> 05:18:22.920 align:start position:0%
balance of the what's in the what's in
 
05:18:25.190 --> 05:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
the account so if the organization
 
05:18:28.010 --> 05:18:28.020 align:start position:0%
that's caretaking the caretaker of the
 
05:18:31.490 --> 05:18:31.500 align:start position:0%
account goes belly up or whatever uh how
 
05:18:33.830 --> 05:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
does the uh how's the employee guarantee
 
05:18:37.190 --> 05:18:37.200 align:start position:0%
that that money ah is still there that's
 
05:18:39.830 --> 05:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
that I believe Mr Downing will be able
 
05:18:41.810 --> 05:18:41.820 align:start position:0%
to answer
 
05:18:45.288 --> 05:18:45.298 align:start position:0%
because it it depends on the plan and he
 
05:18:46.850 --> 05:18:46.860 align:start position:0%
has information about New Hampshire's
 
05:18:50.270 --> 05:18:50.280 align:start position:0%
plan okay thank you other questions
 
05:18:51.890 --> 05:18:51.900 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none thank you very
 
05:18:54.288 --> 05:18:54.298 align:start position:0%
much Mr Savage thank you for your time
 
05:18:56.690 --> 05:18:56.700 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
05:18:59.628 --> 05:18:59.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:05.448 --> 05:19:05.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:10.310 --> 05:19:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:11.810 --> 05:19:11.820 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair members of the
 
05:19:14.150 --> 05:19:14.160 align:start position:0%
committee representative Ken Weiler uh
 
05:19:16.910 --> 05:19:16.920 align:start position:0%
Rockingham 13.
 
05:19:16.920 --> 05:19:18.530 align:start position:0%
Rockingham 13.
um

05:19:18.530 --> 05:19:18.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:19:20.570 --> 05:19:20.580 align:start position:0%
I've heard a lot of the details on this
 
05:19:20.580 --> 05:19:22.368 align:start position:0%
I've heard a lot of the details on this
bill

05:19:22.368 --> 05:19:22.378 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:19:24.708 --> 05:19:24.718 align:start position:0%
which I re I support
 
05:19:27.368 --> 05:19:27.378 align:start position:0%
so I'm more or less offer a personal
 
05:19:32.090 --> 05:19:32.100 align:start position:0%
experience that I think is is called is
 
05:19:33.948 --> 05:19:33.958 align:start position:0%
certainly relevant
 
05:19:36.110 --> 05:19:36.120 align:start position:0%
I work for American Airlines as a pilot
 
05:19:39.590 --> 05:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
from 1970 to 2001.
 
05:19:42.470 --> 05:19:42.480 align:start position:0%
and I had because of my union we had
 
05:19:44.810 --> 05:19:44.820 align:start position:0%
both an a fund and a b fund one was
 
05:19:46.788 --> 05:19:46.798 align:start position:0%
defined benefit the other one was
 
05:19:49.128 --> 05:19:49.138 align:start position:0%
defined contribution
 
05:19:51.650 --> 05:19:51.660 align:start position:0%
they put seven and a half percent
 
05:19:55.128 --> 05:19:55.138 align:start position:0%
of my pay into a defined benefit
 
05:19:58.190 --> 05:19:58.200 align:start position:0%
they put four percent into a defined
 
05:20:00.530 --> 05:20:00.540 align:start position:0%
contribution now unlike the other
 
05:20:03.650 --> 05:20:03.660 align:start position:0%
airlines that I have friends with
 
05:20:06.170 --> 05:20:06.180 align:start position:0%
I was able to take both of those in a
 
05:20:07.430 --> 05:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
lump sum
 
05:20:09.530 --> 05:20:09.540 align:start position:0%
most of my other Airline colleagues all
 
05:20:11.270 --> 05:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
they could take an Alum sum was the
 
05:20:14.090 --> 05:20:14.100 align:start position:0%
Define contribution the defined benefit
 
05:20:15.770 --> 05:20:15.780 align:start position:0%
remained in
 
05:20:18.470 --> 05:20:18.480 align:start position:0%
with the airline
 
05:20:21.350 --> 05:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
when I took the money out in 2001 now
 
05:20:21.360 --> 05:20:22.570 align:start position:0%
when I took the money out in 2001 now
granted

05:20:22.570 --> 05:20:22.580 align:start position:0%
granted
 
05:20:26.030 --> 05:20:26.040 align:start position:0%
1990 as we saw looking at reviewing the
 
05:20:28.550 --> 05:20:28.560 align:start position:0%
retirement system as I always did
 
05:20:30.230 --> 05:20:30.240 align:start position:0%
was very good
 
05:20:32.570 --> 05:20:32.580 align:start position:0%
for the for the
 
05:20:32.580 --> 05:20:34.128 align:start position:0%
for the for the
um

05:20:34.128 --> 05:20:34.138 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:20:36.110 --> 05:20:36.120 align:start position:0%
for the stock market
 
05:20:38.628 --> 05:20:38.638 align:start position:0%
it was averaging close to nine percent a
 
05:20:38.638 --> 05:20:39.590 align:start position:0%
it was averaging close to nine percent a
year

05:20:39.590 --> 05:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
year
 
05:20:42.650 --> 05:20:42.660 align:start position:0%
then it dropped off and the 2000s to
 
05:20:43.970 --> 05:20:43.980 align:start position:0%
about half of that
 
05:20:43.980 --> 05:20:45.110 align:start position:0%
about half of that
but

05:20:45.110 --> 05:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:20:49.190 --> 05:20:49.200 align:start position:0%
so I retire with two lump sums
 
05:20:53.150 --> 05:20:53.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:57.288 --> 05:20:57.298 align:start position:0%
the defined contribution was 60 percent
 
05:20:59.990 --> 05:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
even though only four percent went in
 
05:21:01.910 --> 05:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
and seven and a half percent went into
 
05:21:04.128 --> 05:21:04.138 align:start position:0%
the other seven and a half percent gave
 
05:21:06.230 --> 05:21:06.240 align:start position:0%
me forty percent of my lump sum
 
05:21:08.690 --> 05:21:08.700 align:start position:0%
and the four percent gave me sixty
 
05:21:11.570 --> 05:21:11.580 align:start position:0%
percent I thought that was amazing and I
 
05:21:13.368 --> 05:21:13.378 align:start position:0%
was so delighted that I did have both
 
05:21:15.650 --> 05:21:15.660 align:start position:0%
and had a defined contribution and it
 
05:21:18.530 --> 05:21:18.540 align:start position:0%
always tells me of course that was a
 
05:21:21.230 --> 05:21:21.240 align:start position:0%
very good decade prior to my retirement
 
05:21:24.470 --> 05:21:24.480 align:start position:0%
and it isn't always so and I've always
 
05:21:26.810 --> 05:21:26.820 align:start position:0%
been critical of our retirement system
 
05:21:29.390 --> 05:21:29.400 align:start position:0%
because it has so much variation
 
05:21:31.730 --> 05:21:31.740 align:start position:0%
one year it gets 26 percent the next
 
05:21:33.470 --> 05:21:33.480 align:start position:0%
year it gets minus six
 
05:21:35.650 --> 05:21:35.660 align:start position:0%
none of my
 
05:21:38.270 --> 05:21:38.280 align:start position:0%
managers have had that kind of thing but
 
05:21:40.310 --> 05:21:40.320 align:start position:0%
I think it's very significant when we
 
05:21:41.810 --> 05:21:41.820 align:start position:0%
look at things like that and there's a
 
05:21:43.310 --> 05:21:43.320 align:start position:0%
personal experience and I know some of
 
05:21:46.610 --> 05:21:46.620 align:start position:0%
you other have as well and you know
 
05:21:48.650 --> 05:21:48.660 align:start position:0%
I guess I don't need to repeat all the
 
05:21:49.850 --> 05:21:49.860 align:start position:0%
benefits since there's other people
 
05:21:51.770 --> 05:21:51.780 align:start position:0%
waiting to talk of the defined
 
05:21:53.390 --> 05:21:53.400 align:start position:0%
contribution in my mind it's it's
 
05:21:56.510 --> 05:21:56.520 align:start position:0%
portable it increases with inflation
 
05:21:59.030 --> 05:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
um even though you take the risk we as
 
05:22:00.708 --> 05:22:00.718 align:start position:0%
people trying to do the government
 
05:22:02.990 --> 05:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
budget appreciate the fact that it's not
 
05:22:05.628 --> 05:22:05.638 align:start position:0%
going to go into a deep deficit because
 
05:22:07.490 --> 05:22:07.500 align:start position:0%
the risk is with the employer but so is
 
05:22:10.430 --> 05:22:10.440 align:start position:0%
the upside so I'd be happy to answer any
 
05:22:13.270 --> 05:22:13.280 align:start position:0%
questions but I think Define
 
05:22:15.708 --> 05:22:15.718 align:start position:0%
contributions are a great system and
 
05:22:17.208 --> 05:22:17.218 align:start position:0%
that's why I think so many other states
 
05:22:19.910 --> 05:22:19.920 align:start position:0%
as Mr Savage has said have transferred
 
05:22:22.670 --> 05:22:22.680 align:start position:0%
to them thank you thank you and I'd like
 
05:22:24.830 --> 05:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
to congratulate you on your students as
 
05:22:26.868 --> 05:22:26.878 align:start position:0%
an investor because that's what made the
 
05:22:26.878 --> 05:22:27.890 align:start position:0%
an investor because that's what made the
difference

05:22:27.890 --> 05:22:27.900 align:start position:0%
difference
 
05:22:29.930 --> 05:22:29.940 align:start position:0%
yes and now I have more than I started
 
05:22:32.330 --> 05:22:32.340 align:start position:0%
with even though I've been taking big
 
05:22:35.030 --> 05:22:35.040 align:start position:0%
months out every year yep glad to hear
 
05:22:36.830 --> 05:22:36.840 align:start position:0%
it and you have anyone have any
 
05:22:36.840 --> 05:22:37.970 align:start position:0%
it and you have anyone have any
questions

05:22:37.970 --> 05:22:37.980 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:22:40.128 --> 05:22:40.138 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much
 
05:22:48.830 --> 05:22:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:50.750 --> 05:22:50.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for the record I'm
 
05:22:53.208 --> 05:22:53.218 align:start position:0%
representative Tony leckis representing
 
05:22:55.730 --> 05:22:55.740 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro 38 the towns of Hudson and
 
05:22:59.690 --> 05:22:59.700 align:start position:0%
Litchfield and so my intent here is to
 
05:23:01.550 --> 05:23:01.560 align:start position:0%
go over the bill
 
05:23:04.070 --> 05:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
in the various sections to kind of
 
05:23:06.708 --> 05:23:06.718 align:start position:0%
explain how this works and
 
05:23:10.190 --> 05:23:10.200 align:start position:0%
the first part is defining who is in
 
05:23:10.200 --> 05:23:11.390 align:start position:0%
the first part is defining who is in
this

05:23:11.390 --> 05:23:11.400 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:23:14.390 --> 05:23:14.400 align:start position:0%
the new defined contribution plan
 
05:23:18.110 --> 05:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
and we wanted to start out small
 
05:23:21.170 --> 05:23:21.180 align:start position:0%
and see what the experience is so this
 
05:23:22.550 --> 05:23:22.560 align:start position:0%
it's just
 
05:23:22.560 --> 05:23:23.330 align:start position:0%
it's just
um

05:23:23.330 --> 05:23:23.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:23:25.490 --> 05:23:25.500 align:start position:0%
employees and that's employee is sort of
 
05:23:27.250 --> 05:23:27.260 align:start position:0%
the term of Art in the retirement system
 
05:23:30.110 --> 05:23:30.120 align:start position:0%
of the state not political subdivision
 
05:23:35.150 --> 05:23:35.160 align:start position:0%
so the change here is it it takes
 
05:23:36.890 --> 05:23:36.900 align:start position:0%
um you know any person who becomes a
 
05:23:39.590 --> 05:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
political subdivision employee
 
05:23:41.930 --> 05:23:41.940 align:start position:0%
or a teacher permanent policeman and
 
05:23:44.690 --> 05:23:44.700 align:start position:0%
permanent fireman the group two people
 
05:23:44.700 --> 05:23:46.250 align:start position:0%
permanent fireman the group two people
um

05:23:46.250 --> 05:23:46.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:23:50.448 --> 05:23:50.458 align:start position:0%
will remain in the defined benefit plan
 
05:23:53.288 --> 05:23:53.298 align:start position:0%
and people who are um
 
05:23:55.610 --> 05:23:55.620 align:start position:0%
further down
 
05:23:58.310 --> 05:23:58.320 align:start position:0%
other state employees so that's other
 
05:24:01.128 --> 05:24:01.138 align:start position:0%
than teachers and and group two
 
05:24:05.330 --> 05:24:05.340 align:start position:0%
who begin after uh July of 2024 she'll
 
05:24:07.850 --> 05:24:07.860 align:start position:0%
join what this is calling group three
 
05:24:11.570 --> 05:24:11.580 align:start position:0%
which is the defined contribution plan
 
05:24:15.170 --> 05:24:15.180 align:start position:0%
all right so the next section is the
 
05:24:18.770 --> 05:24:18.780 align:start position:0%
part that requires that the employers
 
05:24:21.230 --> 05:24:21.240 align:start position:0%
continue to pay based on the gross
 
05:24:21.240 --> 05:24:22.850 align:start position:0%
continue to pay based on the gross
salary

05:24:22.850 --> 05:24:22.860 align:start position:0%
salary
 
05:24:25.910 --> 05:24:25.920 align:start position:0%
um the past debt in uh the unfunded
 
05:24:27.708 --> 05:24:27.718 align:start position:0%
liability similar to an earlier Bill
 
05:24:31.070 --> 05:24:31.080 align:start position:0%
where if the employee if they get rid of
 
05:24:32.448 --> 05:24:32.458 align:start position:0%
the position they have to continue to do
 
05:24:33.530 --> 05:24:33.540 align:start position:0%
it as well
 
05:24:36.170 --> 05:24:36.180 align:start position:0%
if the people are no longer you know in
 
05:24:38.650 --> 05:24:38.660 align:start position:0%
the or the future people are not in
 
05:24:41.690 --> 05:24:41.700 align:start position:0%
the defined benefit plan they still have
 
05:24:47.330 --> 05:24:47.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:48.650 --> 05:24:48.660 align:start position:0%
and then
 
05:24:52.010 --> 05:24:52.020 align:start position:0%
um the rest of it is just setting up
 
05:24:53.868 --> 05:24:53.878 align:start position:0%
the plan
 
05:24:56.510 --> 05:24:56.520 align:start position:0%
if you look here there's a commission on
 
05:24:58.610 --> 05:24:58.620 align:start position:0%
page two line seven a commission needs a
 
05:25:00.890 --> 05:25:00.900 align:start position:0%
deferred compensation commission under
 
05:25:03.430 --> 05:25:03.440 align:start position:0%
RSA 101b that is the
 
05:25:05.690 --> 05:25:05.700 align:start position:0%
previously mentioned plan that's
 
05:25:08.868 --> 05:25:08.878 align:start position:0%
voluntary any any employee can put money
 
05:25:10.570 --> 05:25:10.580 align:start position:0%
into it if they want
 
05:25:13.190 --> 05:25:13.200 align:start position:0%
and it is a defined contribution plan
 
05:25:15.590 --> 05:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
that's been going for around 35 years
 
05:25:19.490 --> 05:25:19.500 align:start position:0%
so that is well well established
 
05:25:19.500 --> 05:25:21.788 align:start position:0%
so that is well well established
um

05:25:21.788 --> 05:25:21.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:24.948 --> 05:25:24.958 align:start position:0%
and further down it actually establishes
 
05:25:27.590 --> 05:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
that Define contribution plan
 
05:25:30.050 --> 05:25:30.060 align:start position:0%
and it requires that um
 
05:25:32.030 --> 05:25:32.040 align:start position:0%
any rules meet
 
05:25:34.670 --> 05:25:34.680 align:start position:0%
the federal requirements to make it
 
05:25:38.390 --> 05:25:38.400 align:start position:0%
valid under Section 401a and 414 D of
 
05:25:40.070 --> 05:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
the Internal Revenue code and that's
 
05:25:42.708 --> 05:25:42.718 align:start position:0%
what among other things allows the
 
05:25:45.288 --> 05:25:45.298 align:start position:0%
contributions to be tax-exempt
 
05:25:48.410 --> 05:25:48.420 align:start position:0%
you know if you're a federal taxes it
 
05:25:50.030 --> 05:25:50.040 align:start position:0%
has to meet those requirements the same
 
05:25:52.970 --> 05:25:52.980 align:start position:0%
as a 401k a plan that an employer might
 
05:25:52.980 --> 05:25:54.890 align:start position:0%
as a 401k a plan that an employer might
offer

05:25:54.890 --> 05:25:54.900 align:start position:0%
offer
 
05:25:54.900 --> 05:25:57.650 align:start position:0%
offer
okay

05:25:57.650 --> 05:25:57.660 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:25:57.660 --> 05:25:58.850 align:start position:0%
okay
um

05:25:58.850 --> 05:25:58.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:26:01.850 --> 05:26:01.860 align:start position:0%
towards the bottom there it it provides
 
05:26:04.970 --> 05:26:04.980 align:start position:0%
the standard rule making
 
05:26:08.330 --> 05:26:08.340 align:start position:0%
um under 541a so that
 
05:26:11.150 --> 05:26:11.160 align:start position:0%
the the executive director can adopt
 
05:26:13.128 --> 05:26:13.138 align:start position:0%
rules on how the whole thing works under
 
05:26:15.770 --> 05:26:15.780 align:start position:0%
this that standard
 
05:26:15.780 --> 05:26:16.970 align:start position:0%
this that standard
purpose

05:26:16.970 --> 05:26:16.980 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
05:26:16.980 --> 05:26:17.750 align:start position:0%
purpose
um

05:26:17.750 --> 05:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:26:20.750 --> 05:26:20.760 align:start position:0%
the plan maybe doesn't have to be it may
 
05:26:22.070 --> 05:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
be contracted with a third party
 
05:26:22.080 --> 05:26:24.530 align:start position:0%
be contracted with a third party
administrator

05:26:24.530 --> 05:26:24.540 align:start position:0%
administrator
 
05:26:26.448 --> 05:26:26.458 align:start position:0%
um I know you know I don't know maybe
 
05:26:27.948 --> 05:26:27.958 align:start position:0%
some companies administering their own
 
05:26:30.830 --> 05:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
401ks I'm not familiar with one I had
 
05:26:32.570 --> 05:26:32.580 align:start position:0%
one for many years which you know they
 
05:26:34.010 --> 05:26:34.020 align:start position:0%
had did it through Fidelity there's
 
05:26:38.270 --> 05:26:38.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:41.510 --> 05:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
and powers of the commission and it uh
 
05:26:41.520 --> 05:26:43.610 align:start position:0%
and powers of the commission and it uh
basically

05:26:43.610 --> 05:26:43.620 align:start position:0%
basically
 
05:26:45.708 --> 05:26:45.718 align:start position:0%
goes through and defines the powers that
 
05:26:47.868 --> 05:26:47.878 align:start position:0%
let them basically operate the plan if
 
05:26:49.128 --> 05:26:49.138 align:start position:0%
people have questions about anything
 
05:26:49.138 --> 05:26:50.330 align:start position:0%
people have questions about anything
particular

05:26:50.330 --> 05:26:50.340 align:start position:0%
particular
 
05:26:52.910 --> 05:26:52.920 align:start position:0%
I'll deal with them I need to point out
 
05:26:55.910 --> 05:26:55.920 align:start position:0%
on page three line 25 while 26 and then
 
05:26:58.010 --> 05:26:58.020 align:start position:0%
at the bottom of that page where it
 
05:27:00.350 --> 05:27:00.360 align:start position:0%
mentions the percentage
 
05:27:02.330 --> 05:27:02.340 align:start position:0%
of the employee contribution and the
 
05:27:04.490 --> 05:27:04.500 align:start position:0%
employer contribution this is an error
 
05:27:06.890 --> 05:27:06.900 align:start position:0%
we got the amendment back late yesterday
 
05:27:06.900 --> 05:27:08.330 align:start position:0%
we got the amendment back late yesterday
and

05:27:08.330 --> 05:27:08.340 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:27:10.730 --> 05:27:10.740 align:start position:0%
the OLS didn't appear to put in what we
 
05:27:13.730 --> 05:27:13.740 align:start position:0%
wanted what that will be is identical to
 
05:27:15.530 --> 05:27:15.540 align:start position:0%
the current rates for the employee and
 
05:27:17.690 --> 05:27:17.700 align:start position:0%
employer contribution for the current
 
05:27:17.700 --> 05:27:18.948 align:start position:0%
employer contribution for the current
plan

05:27:18.948 --> 05:27:18.958 align:start position:0%
plan
 
05:27:21.948 --> 05:27:21.958 align:start position:0%
that is it still is a minimum of seven
 
05:27:25.250 --> 05:27:25.260 align:start position:0%
percent from the employee correct that
 
05:27:27.110 --> 05:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
is the seven percent that they put into
 
05:27:30.530 --> 05:27:30.540 align:start position:0%
the defined benefit plan plus whatever
 
05:27:33.708 --> 05:27:33.718 align:start position:0%
voluntary contributions they may wish to
 
05:27:37.550 --> 05:27:37.560 align:start position:0%
add and the employer will put in two and
 
05:27:39.650 --> 05:27:39.660 align:start position:0%
a half percent or so yeah it's I think
 
05:27:41.628 --> 05:27:41.638 align:start position:0%
it's like 2.48 or it's slightly under
 
05:27:44.510 --> 05:27:44.520 align:start position:0%
two and a half percent yeah I believe
 
05:27:46.610 --> 05:27:46.620 align:start position:0%
but the intent is for that to be
 
05:27:48.830 --> 05:27:48.840 align:start position:0%
identical and we're not standing up a
 
05:27:50.750 --> 05:27:50.760 align:start position:0%
new plan this is basically
 
05:27:52.490 --> 05:27:52.500 align:start position:0%
well it's
 
05:27:54.470 --> 05:27:54.480 align:start position:0%
the employee part is going to be under
 
05:27:58.670 --> 05:27:58.680 align:start position:0%
the existing plan that's in 101b
 
05:28:00.230 --> 05:28:00.240 align:start position:0%
there is
 
05:28:02.270 --> 05:28:02.280 align:start position:0%
it's a little complicated because the
 
05:28:04.550 --> 05:28:04.560 align:start position:0%
IRS requires the employee and the
 
05:28:07.910 --> 05:28:07.920 align:start position:0%
employer contributions to go technically
 
05:28:10.190 --> 05:28:10.200 align:start position:0%
into separate funds
 
05:28:12.350 --> 05:28:12.360 align:start position:0%
but the way it's to be administered is
 
05:28:14.090 --> 05:28:14.100 align:start position:0%
that that's going to be basically
 
05:28:15.650 --> 05:28:15.660 align:start position:0%
invisible to the employee their
 
05:28:17.448 --> 05:28:17.458 align:start position:0%
decisions on how Investments are made
 
05:28:20.448 --> 05:28:20.458 align:start position:0%
would apply in the same manner to each
 
05:28:22.730 --> 05:28:22.740 align:start position:0%
fund but underneath there has to be that
 
05:28:25.430 --> 05:28:25.440 align:start position:0%
structure to satisfy the federal
 
05:28:25.440 --> 05:28:28.070 align:start position:0%
structure to satisfy the federal
government

05:28:28.070 --> 05:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:28.080 --> 05:28:30.830 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:28:30.830 --> 05:28:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:30.840 --> 05:28:35.570 align:start position:0%
 
okay and

05:28:35.570 --> 05:28:35.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:38.330 --> 05:28:38.340 align:start position:0%
then the withdrawal rules
 
05:28:40.368 --> 05:28:40.378 align:start position:0%
um are on the the last page
 
05:28:42.050 --> 05:28:42.060 align:start position:0%
and it's the standard things that exist
 
05:28:44.150 --> 05:28:44.160 align:start position:0%
for 401k if you have a 401k or an IRA
 
05:28:46.550 --> 05:28:46.560 align:start position:0%
you can't just take the money out on a
 
05:28:46.560 --> 05:28:47.530 align:start position:0%
you can't just take the money out on a
whim

05:28:47.530 --> 05:28:47.540 align:start position:0%
whim
 
05:28:49.670 --> 05:28:49.680 align:start position:0%
at least not with plans that I'm
 
05:28:51.770 --> 05:28:51.780 align:start position:0%
familiar with you know termination of
 
05:28:55.010 --> 05:28:55.020 align:start position:0%
employment retirement you reach 59 and a
 
05:28:55.020 --> 05:28:56.150 align:start position:0%
employment retirement you reach 59 and a
half

05:28:56.150 --> 05:28:56.160 align:start position:0%
half
 
05:28:59.270 --> 05:28:59.280 align:start position:0%
and there's some other special hardship
 
05:28:59.280 --> 05:29:00.470 align:start position:0%
and there's some other special hardship
ones

05:29:00.470 --> 05:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
ones
 
05:29:01.850 --> 05:29:01.860 align:start position:0%
um you know extraordinary medical
 
05:29:03.708 --> 05:29:03.718 align:start position:0%
expenses or certain other things that
 
05:29:07.128 --> 05:29:07.138 align:start position:0%
the IRS permits early withdrawals
 
05:29:09.288 --> 05:29:09.298 align:start position:0%
but um
 
05:29:12.170 --> 05:29:12.180 align:start position:0%
you know but but you can't just go buy a
 
05:29:14.208 --> 05:29:14.218 align:start position:0%
nice car face you know with your uh what
 
05:29:16.670 --> 05:29:16.680 align:start position:0%
should be your retirement savings and
 
05:29:18.110 --> 05:29:18.120 align:start position:0%
then there's a section on required
 
05:29:18.120 --> 05:29:19.430 align:start position:0%
then there's a section on required
distributions

05:29:19.430 --> 05:29:19.440 align:start position:0%
distributions
 
05:29:22.010 --> 05:29:22.020 align:start position:0%
this is again uh to go along with the
 
05:29:25.128 --> 05:29:25.138 align:start position:0%
IRS rules if anybody is a has Ira or
 
05:29:27.050 --> 05:29:27.060 align:start position:0%
401K especially if you're retired and
 
05:29:28.310 --> 05:29:28.320 align:start position:0%
living off of it
 
05:29:29.990 --> 05:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
you may be aware there's a minimum
 
05:29:32.170 --> 05:29:32.180 align:start position:0%
required distributions based on your age
 
05:29:34.610 --> 05:29:34.620 align:start position:0%
and some other factors and that has to
 
05:29:38.448 --> 05:29:38.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:41.270 --> 05:29:41.280 align:start position:0%
and as was mentioned when it's starting
 
05:29:41.280 --> 05:29:42.230 align:start position:0%
and as was mentioned when it's starting
up

05:29:42.230 --> 05:29:42.240 align:start position:0%
up
 
05:29:43.910 --> 05:29:43.920 align:start position:0%
there won't be the money in it
 
05:29:46.730 --> 05:29:46.740 align:start position:0%
originally initially for startup and the
 
05:29:48.948 --> 05:29:48.958 align:start position:0%
early Administration fees and so that
 
05:29:50.330 --> 05:29:50.340 align:start position:0%
would come from the general fund we
 
05:29:53.030 --> 05:29:53.040 align:start position:0%
don't have no fiscal note on it yet as I
 
05:29:55.490 --> 05:29:55.500 align:start position:0%
said this amendment came out yesterday
 
05:29:55.500 --> 05:29:56.690 align:start position:0%
said this amendment came out yesterday
late

05:29:56.690 --> 05:29:56.700 align:start position:0%
late
 
05:29:59.948 --> 05:29:59.958 align:start position:0%
but then they will be born
 
05:30:02.868 --> 05:30:02.878 align:start position:0%
by the plan by the contributions go to
 
05:30:05.270 --> 05:30:05.280 align:start position:0%
the plan once it gets going
 
05:30:07.250 --> 05:30:07.260 align:start position:0%
or by the general fund if a future
 
05:30:09.050 --> 05:30:09.060 align:start position:0%
legislature decides to include future
 
05:30:11.510 --> 05:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
legislature can do whatever it like but
 
05:30:13.670 --> 05:30:13.680 align:start position:0%
I'll be glad to answer questions
 
05:30:16.010 --> 05:30:16.020 align:start position:0%
okay representative shrew
 
05:30:17.510 --> 05:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
05:30:20.090 --> 05:30:20.100 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh going back to the
 
05:30:20.100 --> 05:30:21.530 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh going back to the
era

05:30:21.530 --> 05:30:21.540 align:start position:0%
era
 
05:30:24.050 --> 05:30:24.060 align:start position:0%
um You referred to on page three uh 24
 
05:30:26.810 --> 05:30:26.820 align:start position:0%
to 28
 
05:30:29.390 --> 05:30:29.400 align:start position:0%
that's going to be corrected
 
05:30:30.770 --> 05:30:30.780 align:start position:0%
yes there will have to be another
 
05:30:32.868 --> 05:30:32.878 align:start position:0%
amendment there's uh bill could you go
 
05:30:35.930 --> 05:30:35.940 align:start position:0%
over that one more time slowly sure
 
05:30:35.940 --> 05:30:37.430 align:start position:0%
over that one more time slowly sure
currently

05:30:37.430 --> 05:30:37.440 align:start position:0%
currently
 
05:30:40.430 --> 05:30:40.440 align:start position:0%
on the current retirement plan the the
 
05:30:42.770 --> 05:30:42.780 align:start position:0%
group one employees are required to
 
05:30:45.170 --> 05:30:45.180 align:start position:0%
contribute seven seven percent of their
 
05:30:47.930 --> 05:30:47.940 align:start position:0%
salary to the retirement plan that will
 
05:30:49.430 --> 05:30:49.440 align:start position:0%
remain the same
 
05:30:51.610 --> 05:30:51.620 align:start position:0%
but instead of going into the current
 
05:30:54.410 --> 05:30:54.420 align:start position:0%
defined benefit plan it would go into
 
05:30:56.628 --> 05:30:56.638 align:start position:0%
the new Define well not new it's the
 
05:31:00.170 --> 05:31:00.180 align:start position:0%
existing plan
 
05:31:02.810 --> 05:31:02.820 align:start position:0%
okay and then the employer it's
 
05:31:05.150 --> 05:31:05.160 align:start position:0%
approximately two and a half percent
 
05:31:07.190 --> 05:31:07.200 align:start position:0%
which is I I whatever the number is
 
05:31:10.430 --> 05:31:10.440 align:start position:0%
it'll be identical to the current number
 
05:31:13.190 --> 05:31:13.200 align:start position:0%
and that will go into the plan and as I
 
05:31:15.770 --> 05:31:15.780 align:start position:0%
mentioned strange IRS rules it
 
05:31:17.628 --> 05:31:17.638 align:start position:0%
technically goes into a separate fund
 
05:31:21.350 --> 05:31:21.360 align:start position:0%
but it's invested in the same way as uh
 
05:31:24.890 --> 05:31:24.900 align:start position:0%
is the one on the plan under 101b so the
 
05:31:28.730 --> 05:31:28.740 align:start position:0%
error is on line 34 where it says seven
 
05:31:32.590 --> 05:31:32.600 align:start position:0%
percent and also 26.
 
05:31:36.650 --> 05:31:36.660 align:start position:0%
right 26 is correct thank you but um
 
05:31:41.090 --> 05:31:41.100 align:start position:0%
line 34 is the employer shall contribute
 
05:31:43.850 --> 05:31:43.860 align:start position:0%
uh whatever the current
 
05:31:48.890 --> 05:31:48.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:51.230 --> 05:31:51.240 align:start position:0%
so this is a fairly stingy employer
 
05:31:53.810 --> 05:31:53.820 align:start position:0%
match yes representative true thank you
 
05:31:56.208 --> 05:31:56.218 align:start position:0%
madam chair just so
 
05:31:58.550 --> 05:31:58.560 align:start position:0%
under this new plan
 
05:32:02.868 --> 05:32:02.878 align:start position:0%
the uh the new employee
 
05:32:05.390 --> 05:32:05.400 align:start position:0%
is paying nothing into the New Hampshire
 
05:32:06.948 --> 05:32:06.958 align:start position:0%
Retirement System
 
05:32:10.070 --> 05:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
uh they are not however their employer
 
05:32:11.690 --> 05:32:11.700 align:start position:0%
is still going to pay
 
05:32:13.910 --> 05:32:13.920 align:start position:0%
the normal amount towards the unfunded
 
05:32:17.690 --> 05:32:17.700 align:start position:0%
liability 10-7 or whatever yep thank you
 
05:32:21.948 --> 05:32:21.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:35.030 --> 05:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:36.890 --> 05:32:36.900 align:start position:0%
thank you members of the committee uh my
 
05:32:38.628 --> 05:32:38.638 align:start position:0%
name is representative Santo nastasso
 
05:32:41.270 --> 05:32:41.280 align:start position:0%
representing the towns of ringe Jaffrey
 
05:32:42.350 --> 05:32:42.360 align:start position:0%
and Dublin
 
05:32:44.150 --> 05:32:44.160 align:start position:0%
uh just briefly want to remind the
 
05:32:46.128 --> 05:32:46.138 align:start position:0%
committee about the New Hampshire
 
05:32:49.970 --> 05:32:49.980 align:start position:0%
Constitution part one article 36 economy
 
05:32:51.890 --> 05:32:51.900 align:start position:0%
being a most essential virtue in all
 
05:32:53.810 --> 05:32:53.820 align:start position:0%
states especially in a young one no
 
05:32:55.850 --> 05:32:55.860 align:start position:0%
pension shall be granted but in
 
05:32:57.890 --> 05:32:57.900 align:start position:0%
consideration of actual services and
 
05:32:59.510 --> 05:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
such pensions ought to be granted with
 
05:33:01.850 --> 05:33:01.860 align:start position:0%
great caution by the legislator and
 
05:33:04.610 --> 05:33:04.620 align:start position:0%
never for more than one year at a time
 
05:33:06.770 --> 05:33:06.780 align:start position:0%
so this article is clearly intended to
 
05:33:08.448 --> 05:33:08.458 align:start position:0%
prevent the state from going to the debt
 
05:33:11.330 --> 05:33:11.340 align:start position:0%
over pensions by forcing them to only be
 
05:33:13.490 --> 05:33:13.500 align:start position:0%
granted at one year at a time and that's
 
05:33:15.530 --> 05:33:15.540 align:start position:0%
exactly what a defined contribution plan
 
05:33:18.670 --> 05:33:18.680 align:start position:0%
such as the one in House Bill 559
 
05:33:20.868 --> 05:33:20.878 align:start position:0%
accomplishes each year the state
 
05:33:22.368 --> 05:33:22.378 align:start position:0%
contributes to the pension benefit
 
05:33:24.708 --> 05:33:24.718 align:start position:0%
earned by the employee in that year and
 
05:33:26.448 --> 05:33:26.458 align:start position:0%
there's no future liability
 
05:33:29.090 --> 05:33:29.100 align:start position:0%
so this constitutional provision has
 
05:33:31.368 --> 05:33:31.378 align:start position:0%
been ignored uh resulting in the
 
05:33:32.628 --> 05:33:32.638 align:start position:0%
situation we have now billions of
 
05:33:35.628 --> 05:33:35.638 align:start position:0%
dollars in debt and uh a check at the
 
05:33:37.368 --> 05:33:37.378 align:start position:0%
live State Library revealed it's never
 
05:33:39.708 --> 05:33:39.718 align:start position:0%
been litigated so obviously I support
 
05:33:40.670 --> 05:33:40.680 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
05:33:42.770 --> 05:33:42.780 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:33:45.590 --> 05:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:47.510 --> 05:33:47.520 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you
 
05:33:49.070 --> 05:33:49.080 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question so
 
05:33:50.810 --> 05:33:50.820 align:start position:0%
in looking at this this is just your
 
05:33:52.788 --> 05:33:52.798 align:start position:0%
opinion it has not been litigated and
 
05:33:54.470 --> 05:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
has not been found unconstitutional
 
05:33:57.288 --> 05:33:57.298 align:start position:0%
correct uh it has not been litigated but
 
05:34:00.708 --> 05:34:00.718 align:start position:0%
uh I don't think that part one article
 
05:34:03.530 --> 05:34:03.540 align:start position:0%
36 you know is too complicated it seems
 
05:34:06.708 --> 05:34:06.718 align:start position:0%
like it would be out of violation
 
05:34:09.110 --> 05:34:09.120 align:start position:0%
so this is your opinion well yeah so
 
05:34:13.670 --> 05:34:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:17.390 --> 05:34:17.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:20.750 --> 05:34:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:20.760 --> 05:34:22.070 align:start position:0%
 
here

05:34:22.070 --> 05:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
here
 
05:34:24.770 --> 05:34:24.780 align:start position:0%
and actually do you think Mr Downing
 
05:34:27.650 --> 05:34:27.660 align:start position:0%
should join you or are you uh
 
05:34:31.128 --> 05:34:31.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:33.410 --> 05:34:33.420 align:start position:0%
okay separate thank you representative
 
05:34:40.090 --> 05:34:40.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:40.100 --> 05:34:42.610 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

05:34:42.610 --> 05:34:42.620 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
05:34:44.868 --> 05:34:44.878 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair again for the
 
05:34:46.430 --> 05:34:46.440 align:start position:0%
record my name is Marty Carlin
 
05:34:47.390 --> 05:34:47.400 align:start position:0%
representing the New Hampshire
 
05:34:49.670 --> 05:34:49.680 align:start position:0%
retirement system uh the retirement
 
05:34:51.890 --> 05:34:51.900 align:start position:0%
system doesn't have a position on this
 
05:34:51.900 --> 05:34:53.208 align:start position:0%
system doesn't have a position on this
bill

05:34:53.208 --> 05:34:53.218 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:34:54.708 --> 05:34:54.718 align:start position:0%
um I had a chance to look at the
 
05:34:56.930 --> 05:34:56.940 align:start position:0%
amendment uh briefly
 
05:34:59.448 --> 05:34:59.458 align:start position:0%
um since since it was uh drafted uh
 
05:35:01.850 --> 05:35:01.860 align:start position:0%
yesterday afternoon uh this actually
 
05:35:04.430 --> 05:35:04.440 align:start position:0%
takes a lot of nhrs's role out of the
 
05:35:06.890 --> 05:35:06.900 align:start position:0%
plan and the plan Administration for
 
05:35:08.628 --> 05:35:08.638 align:start position:0%
this defined contribution plan is more
 
05:35:12.410 --> 05:35:12.420 align:start position:0%
with the with the Deferred Comp plan
 
05:35:14.330 --> 05:35:14.340 align:start position:0%
um in in the state which is separate
 
05:35:16.430 --> 05:35:16.440 align:start position:0%
from nhrs
 
05:35:19.490 --> 05:35:19.500 align:start position:0%
um just some general comments uh in the
 
05:35:23.030 --> 05:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
initial proposal for this bill the there
 
05:35:25.730 --> 05:35:25.740 align:start position:0%
was no provision for capturing the
 
05:35:28.730 --> 05:35:28.740 align:start position:0%
liabilities for a declining pool of
 
05:35:30.288 --> 05:35:30.298 align:start position:0%
state employees
 
05:35:32.330 --> 05:35:32.340 align:start position:0%
um this amendment would address that by
 
05:35:34.490 --> 05:35:34.500 align:start position:0%
having employers pay us the the unfunded
 
05:35:37.670 --> 05:35:37.680 align:start position:0%
portion of the existing employer rate on
 
05:35:40.550 --> 05:35:40.560 align:start position:0%
the salary for these if that wasn't in
 
05:35:42.590 --> 05:35:42.600 align:start position:0%
there then there'd be a smaller smaller
 
05:35:44.390 --> 05:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
pool of group one employees mainly
 
05:35:46.850 --> 05:35:46.860 align:start position:0%
Municipal and those costs would be
 
05:35:48.650 --> 05:35:48.660 align:start position:0%
shifted over to the municipalities but
 
05:35:50.470 --> 05:35:50.480 align:start position:0%
that's not the case here
 
05:35:53.270 --> 05:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
just based on some prior testimony just
 
05:35:55.610 --> 05:35:55.620 align:start position:0%
just a couple things to sort of clarify
 
05:35:56.750 --> 05:35:56.760 align:start position:0%
as as
 
05:35:58.070 --> 05:35:58.080 align:start position:0%
um I think there was a question about
 
05:35:59.750 --> 05:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
what's the difference between a defined
 
05:36:01.788 --> 05:36:01.798 align:start position:0%
benefit plan and a defined contribution
 
05:36:03.770 --> 05:36:03.780 align:start position:0%
and the one thing that I hadn't heard
 
05:36:06.590 --> 05:36:06.600 align:start position:0%
was it it basically it's risk a defined
 
05:36:08.510 --> 05:36:08.520 align:start position:0%
benefit plan the risk is on the employer
 
05:36:10.250 --> 05:36:10.260 align:start position:0%
to make up the difference to fund the
 
05:36:12.650 --> 05:36:12.660 align:start position:0%
plan on a defined contribution plan it's
 
05:36:13.970 --> 05:36:13.980 align:start position:0%
on the individuals I think
 
05:36:16.310 --> 05:36:16.320 align:start position:0%
representative Gerhard asked early well
 
05:36:18.110 --> 05:36:18.120 align:start position:0%
what happened if someone you know didn't
 
05:36:20.330 --> 05:36:20.340 align:start position:0%
invest well and and you know I guess
 
05:36:21.830 --> 05:36:21.840 align:start position:0%
Public Assistance would be the answer
 
05:36:23.030 --> 05:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
for that
 
05:36:24.948 --> 05:36:24.958 align:start position:0%
um you know that you know the government
 
05:36:27.650 --> 05:36:27.660 align:start position:0%
tends to be the last resort of services
 
05:36:29.350 --> 05:36:29.360 align:start position:0%
for the Indigent
 
05:36:32.750 --> 05:36:32.760 align:start position:0%
there are some pension systems around
 
05:36:35.208 --> 05:36:35.218 align:start position:0%
the country that have sort of a shared
 
05:36:37.610 --> 05:36:37.620 align:start position:0%
risk model New Hampshire does not
 
05:36:39.170 --> 05:36:39.180 align:start position:0%
there's some language in the statute
 
05:36:41.810 --> 05:36:41.820 align:start position:0%
that could lead to that 30 years for 20
 
05:36:44.990 --> 05:36:45.000 align:start position:0%
20 years from now but it's it's until
 
05:36:47.330 --> 05:36:47.340 align:start position:0%
this liability is paid down so so
 
05:36:48.650 --> 05:36:48.660 align:start position:0%
there's there's different ways to do
 
05:36:48.660 --> 05:36:49.670 align:start position:0%
there's there's different ways to do
that

05:36:49.670 --> 05:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:36:52.128 --> 05:36:52.138 align:start position:0%
um but this bill essentially would just
 
05:36:54.470 --> 05:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
have us be collecting you know the
 
05:36:57.110 --> 05:36:57.120 align:start position:0%
unfunded rate putting that towards you
 
05:36:59.090 --> 05:36:59.100 align:start position:0%
know the pension debt and and
 
05:37:00.948 --> 05:37:00.958 align:start position:0%
stabilizing the employer contribution
 
05:37:02.390 --> 05:37:02.400 align:start position:0%
rates and there really isn't anything
 
05:37:05.750 --> 05:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
else necessarily that we'd be doing uh
 
05:37:07.430 --> 05:37:07.440 align:start position:0%
with this so it's so it's very limited
 
05:37:10.310 --> 05:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
and you know to confirm and clarify the
 
05:37:13.730 --> 05:37:13.740 align:start position:0%
current components of the uh employee
 
05:37:16.250 --> 05:37:16.260 align:start position:0%
contribute employer contribution rate
 
05:37:19.610 --> 05:37:19.620 align:start position:0%
for employees is 2.48 towards the normal
 
05:37:23.150 --> 05:37:23.160 align:start position:0%
cost as stated in 10.79 towards the
 
05:37:25.850 --> 05:37:25.860 align:start position:0%
unfunded there's also a medical subsidy
 
05:37:28.250 --> 05:37:28.260 align:start position:0%
rate component piece that that's
 
05:37:31.430 --> 05:37:31.440 align:start position:0%
essentially a cash in cash out exchange
 
05:37:33.948 --> 05:37:33.958 align:start position:0%
with admin Services they may have some
 
05:37:35.448 --> 05:37:35.458 align:start position:0%
commentary on that but but the
 
05:37:37.368 --> 05:37:37.378 align:start position:0%
retirement system doesn't
 
05:37:39.948 --> 05:37:39.958 align:start position:0%
um have any any concern with that that
 
05:37:42.470 --> 05:37:42.480 align:start position:0%
piece of it so
 
05:37:45.770 --> 05:37:45.780 align:start position:0%
um really this is very straightforward
 
05:37:47.990 --> 05:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
and our role is limited to it but I
 
05:37:50.448 --> 05:37:50.458 align:start position:0%
would be glad to answer any questions if
 
05:37:53.628 --> 05:37:53.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:56.150 --> 05:37:56.160 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt
 
05:38:00.410 --> 05:38:00.420 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh so Mr Carlin uh
 
05:38:03.350 --> 05:38:03.360 align:start position:0%
even though the nhrs is not taking a
 
05:38:06.770 --> 05:38:06.780 align:start position:0%
position on the bill your analysis of
 
05:38:10.250 --> 05:38:10.260 align:start position:0%
the the structures that are being put in
 
05:38:14.090 --> 05:38:14.100 align:start position:0%
place in this bill suggests to me that
 
05:38:18.288 --> 05:38:18.298 align:start position:0%
you that your opinion is that this is a
 
05:38:21.890 --> 05:38:21.900 align:start position:0%
common sense structurally sound uh
 
05:38:25.250 --> 05:38:25.260 align:start position:0%
apparatus for creating a defined
 
05:38:27.590 --> 05:38:27.600 align:start position:0%
contribution plan in addition to the
 
05:38:30.050 --> 05:38:30.060 align:start position:0%
existing defined benefit plan that we
 
05:38:32.510 --> 05:38:32.520 align:start position:0%
currently have I I think that you know
 
05:38:35.330 --> 05:38:35.340 align:start position:0%
that maybe you know a little bit of an
 
05:38:36.948 --> 05:38:36.958 align:start position:0%
overstatement at this point because we
 
05:38:38.390 --> 05:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
just had to you know we just got this
 
05:38:40.730 --> 05:38:40.740 align:start position:0%
amendment yesterday and then there there
 
05:38:42.530 --> 05:38:42.540 align:start position:0%
are and I was going to say this about
 
05:38:44.330 --> 05:38:44.340 align:start position:0%
the original version of the bill there
 
05:38:46.550 --> 05:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
are a lot of different uh Internal
 
05:38:48.788 --> 05:38:48.798 align:start position:0%
Revenue code and other legal Provisions
 
05:38:51.470 --> 05:38:51.480 align:start position:0%
regarding the setup and administration
 
05:38:53.628 --> 05:38:53.638 align:start position:0%
of a defined contribution plan that are
 
05:38:55.190 --> 05:38:55.200 align:start position:0%
very different from a defined benefit
 
05:38:58.010 --> 05:38:58.020 align:start position:0%
plan and I think you know where
 
05:38:59.810 --> 05:38:59.820 align:start position:0%
hey we're kind of out of this one but we
 
05:39:01.610 --> 05:39:01.620 align:start position:0%
also don't have the staffs who are
 
05:39:03.650 --> 05:39:03.660 align:start position:0%
qualified to comment on those levels is
 
05:39:05.270 --> 05:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
this this might be something that would
 
05:39:07.190 --> 05:39:07.200 align:start position:0%
benefit from review by an outside
 
05:39:09.770 --> 05:39:09.780 align:start position:0%
Council from a financial services firm
 
05:39:11.628 --> 05:39:11.638 align:start position:0%
that does this for a living to make sure
 
05:39:13.010 --> 05:39:13.020 align:start position:0%
there aren't any missing pieces or
 
05:39:15.170 --> 05:39:15.180 align:start position:0%
anything like that our our commentary is
 
05:39:17.150 --> 05:39:17.160 align:start position:0%
limited to the fact that our our primary
 
05:39:19.190 --> 05:39:19.200 align:start position:0%
concern that we would have spoken to
 
05:39:20.750 --> 05:39:20.760 align:start position:0%
when the original bill was that
 
05:39:23.150 --> 05:39:23.160 align:start position:0%
declining pool of state employees
 
05:39:26.208 --> 05:39:26.218 align:start position:0%
putting upward pressure on the the
 
05:39:29.090 --> 05:39:29.100 align:start position:0%
employee employer contribution rate for
 
05:39:32.270 --> 05:39:32.280 align:start position:0%
employees for municipality so you know
 
05:39:36.410 --> 05:39:36.420 align:start position:0%
and also closing the plan out would um
 
05:39:38.448 --> 05:39:38.458 align:start position:0%
lead to
 
05:39:41.090 --> 05:39:41.100 align:start position:0%
um if you know without the unfunded
 
05:39:43.128 --> 05:39:43.138 align:start position:0%
piece being paid could lead to us having
 
05:39:46.430 --> 05:39:46.440 align:start position:0%
to reduce our our return assumptions
 
05:39:48.470 --> 05:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
based on the fact that we'd be more of
 
05:39:50.750 --> 05:39:50.760 align:start position:0%
paying out benefits than enrolling new
 
05:39:53.510 --> 05:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
members so so this but
 
05:39:56.208 --> 05:39:56.218 align:start position:0%
you know strictly speaking this is
 
05:39:59.208 --> 05:39:59.218 align:start position:0%
outside of nhrs so we wouldn't be in a
 
05:40:01.310 --> 05:40:01.320 align:start position:0%
position to comment saying you know good
 
05:40:02.990 --> 05:40:03.000 align:start position:0%
bad or indifferent because it's it would
 
05:40:05.810 --> 05:40:05.820 align:start position:0%
be sort of a standalone thing and you
 
05:40:07.788 --> 05:40:07.798 align:start position:0%
know in parallel to us but not part of
 
05:40:07.798 --> 05:40:09.530 align:start position:0%
know in parallel to us but not part of
us

05:40:09.530 --> 05:40:09.540 align:start position:0%
us
 
05:40:13.550 --> 05:40:13.560 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up so uh you you've
 
05:40:15.650 --> 05:40:15.660 align:start position:0%
referred to the uh
 
05:40:15.660 --> 05:40:17.050 align:start position:0%
referred to the uh
original

05:40:17.050 --> 05:40:17.060 align:start position:0%
original
 
05:40:21.910 --> 05:40:21.920 align:start position:0%
bill which I uh I take it that that
 
05:40:26.390 --> 05:40:26.400 align:start position:0%
represent Dan Maguire as substituting
 
05:40:29.690 --> 05:40:29.700 align:start position:0%
the uh the amendment for the original
 
05:40:32.090 --> 05:40:32.100 align:start position:0%
bill so I'm I'm not considering the
 
05:40:36.110 --> 05:40:36.120 align:start position:0%
original bill at all because uh this is
 
05:40:37.730 --> 05:40:37.740 align:start position:0%
what we've what we've been hearing about
 
05:40:40.128 --> 05:40:40.138 align:start position:0%
with the exception of the mistake on
 
05:40:41.810 --> 05:40:41.820 align:start position:0%
page three
 
05:40:44.810 --> 05:40:44.820 align:start position:0%
um but but uh it seems like it's a very
 
05:40:47.090 --> 05:40:47.100 align:start position:0%
this is a different breed of cat than
 
05:40:48.830 --> 05:40:48.840 align:start position:0%
the original belt very much so
 
05:40:51.350 --> 05:40:51.360 align:start position:0%
representative so and you cross off our
 
05:40:53.628 --> 05:40:53.638 align:start position:0%
fiscal note on the original bill it
 
05:40:55.610 --> 05:40:55.620 align:start position:0%
doesn't track with anything in this one
 
05:40:57.730 --> 05:40:57.740 align:start position:0%
it would have to be completely
 
05:41:00.708 --> 05:41:00.718 align:start position:0%
re-analyzed if this version passes the
 
05:41:02.990 --> 05:41:03.000 align:start position:0%
house you know we would have you
 
05:41:04.670 --> 05:41:04.680 align:start position:0%
actually look at it again and see if
 
05:41:07.010 --> 05:41:07.020 align:start position:0%
there are any potential funding
 
05:41:09.110 --> 05:41:09.120 align:start position:0%
pressures that this would create that
 
05:41:11.330 --> 05:41:11.340 align:start position:0%
you know we're not aware of on the
 
05:41:13.070 --> 05:41:13.080 align:start position:0%
surface you know with you know 12 hours
 
05:41:14.570 --> 05:41:14.580 align:start position:0%
to look 24 hours to look at the
 
05:41:17.390 --> 05:41:17.400 align:start position:0%
amendment but it it follow up but at
 
05:41:20.030 --> 05:41:20.040 align:start position:0%
first blush you don't look at the
 
05:41:22.128 --> 05:41:22.138 align:start position:0%
amendment and say my God look at page
 
05:41:24.590 --> 05:41:24.600 align:start position:0%
three you know that the whole thing
 
05:41:27.470 --> 05:41:27.480 align:start position:0%
drives off the cliff and so forth so
 
05:41:29.868 --> 05:41:29.878 align:start position:0%
this is a this is a fundamentally
 
05:41:33.110 --> 05:41:33.120 align:start position:0%
different breed of cat and seems at
 
05:41:35.030 --> 05:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
first blush without your final
 
05:41:38.270 --> 05:41:38.280 align:start position:0%
imprimatur uh to be a fundamentally
 
05:41:41.810 --> 05:41:41.820 align:start position:0%
sound concept I I I will say that you
 
05:41:44.448 --> 05:41:44.458 align:start position:0%
know initial legal review and review by
 
05:41:46.930 --> 05:41:46.940 align:start position:0%
others we didn't see any
 
05:41:49.368 --> 05:41:49.378 align:start position:0%
flaming dumpsters or whatever the word
 
05:41:50.750 --> 05:41:50.760 align:start position:0%
you'd want to use you know that like oh
 
05:41:52.010 --> 05:41:52.020 align:start position:0%
this is a you know this is a deal
 
05:41:54.530 --> 05:41:54.540 align:start position:0%
breaker this is you know this can't work
 
05:41:58.128 --> 05:41:58.138 align:start position:0%
because of all right X you know I'm not
 
05:41:59.770 --> 05:41:59.780 align:start position:0%
looking forward
 
05:42:02.628 --> 05:42:02.638 align:start position:0%
always always right I'm not looking for
 
05:42:05.030 --> 05:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
your signature on the back of these but
 
05:42:05.930 --> 05:42:05.940 align:start position:0%
it does
 
05:42:08.868 --> 05:42:08.878 align:start position:0%
cover the unfunded liability
 
05:42:12.170 --> 05:42:12.180 align:start position:0%
appropriately and does not decrease
 
05:42:15.770 --> 05:42:15.780 align:start position:0%
these the people in the plan so
 
05:42:17.448 --> 05:42:17.458 align:start position:0%
drastically that you have to change your
 
05:42:19.550 --> 05:42:19.560 align:start position:0%
Investments yeah that this would affect
 
05:42:22.310 --> 05:42:22.320 align:start position:0%
future future employees who would not be
 
05:42:24.110 --> 05:42:24.120 align:start position:0%
members of nhrs I wouldn't be
 
05:42:26.090 --> 05:42:26.100 align:start position:0%
appropriate for us to speak about the
 
05:42:27.350 --> 05:42:27.360 align:start position:0%
merits of it for them they're not
 
05:42:29.030 --> 05:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
members it doesn't
 
05:42:31.128 --> 05:42:31.138 align:start position:0%
try and tie it back
 
05:42:33.770 --> 05:42:33.780 align:start position:0%
representative true
 
05:42:35.570 --> 05:42:35.580 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
05:42:36.770 --> 05:42:36.780 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
05:42:38.750 --> 05:42:38.760 align:start position:0%
earlier you had started throwing out
 
05:42:41.390 --> 05:42:41.400 align:start position:0%
some some percentages I think one of
 
05:42:43.368 --> 05:42:43.378 align:start position:0%
them was a 2.84
 
05:42:45.850 --> 05:42:45.860 align:start position:0%
if 0.48
 
05:42:48.350 --> 05:42:48.360 align:start position:0%
could you repeat those anymore what were
 
05:42:50.030 --> 05:42:50.040 align:start position:0%
they again I'm sure I've written them
 
05:42:51.470 --> 05:42:51.480 align:start position:0%
down a million times I don't know what
 
05:42:53.750 --> 05:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
they are yeah no problem okay so the the
 
05:42:55.910 --> 05:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
when we get back to the pension 101
 
05:42:57.590 --> 05:42:57.600 align:start position:0%
stuff we talk about the normal cost
 
05:42:59.690 --> 05:42:59.700 align:start position:0%
which is the cost of the benefits as
 
05:43:01.788 --> 05:43:01.798 align:start position:0%
they're recruit for an existing employee
 
05:43:04.250 --> 05:43:04.260 align:start position:0%
okay and the actual recalculated that
 
05:43:07.550 --> 05:43:07.560 align:start position:0%
out to be 9.48 of pay
 
05:43:10.490 --> 05:43:10.500 align:start position:0%
so the member pays seven percent of that
 
05:43:13.368 --> 05:43:13.378 align:start position:0%
and then currently under RH the employer
 
05:43:16.250 --> 05:43:16.260 align:start position:0%
pays the remaining 2.48 of the normal
 
05:43:18.590 --> 05:43:18.600 align:start position:0%
cost to fund those benefits going
 
05:43:21.948 --> 05:43:21.958 align:start position:0%
forward so 7 plus 2.48 is the quote
 
05:43:24.410 --> 05:43:24.420 align:start position:0%
normal cost of the plan currently and
 
05:43:26.030 --> 05:43:26.040 align:start position:0%
then there's the the unfunded piece
 
05:43:28.550 --> 05:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
which is is the big you know probably 78
 
05:43:31.310 --> 05:43:31.320 align:start position:0%
of what employers are paying or more is
 
05:43:33.948 --> 05:43:33.958 align:start position:0%
that the the 10.79 and that that's what
 
05:43:36.708 --> 05:43:36.718 align:start position:0%
we would still be receiving from the
 
05:43:39.230 --> 05:43:39.240 align:start position:0%
state for employees participating in
 
05:43:41.150 --> 05:43:41.160 align:start position:0%
this plan so that wouldn't go into their
 
05:43:42.650 --> 05:43:42.660 align:start position:0%
account it wouldn't be part of their
 
05:43:44.990 --> 05:43:45.000 align:start position:0%
defined contribution that's just the
 
05:43:45.000 --> 05:43:45.708 align:start position:0%
defined contribution that's just the
state

05:43:45.708 --> 05:43:45.718 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:43:48.470 --> 05:43:48.480 align:start position:0%
continuing to pay its obligation toward
 
05:43:50.330 --> 05:43:50.340 align:start position:0%
the unfunded for them for the employee
 
05:43:53.868 --> 05:43:53.878 align:start position:0%
group and but in in the uh distant
 
05:43:56.868 --> 05:43:56.878 align:start position:0%
future when the unfunded liability is
 
05:43:59.990 --> 05:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
paid down to the point that the employer
 
05:44:04.250 --> 05:44:04.260 align:start position:0%
rate goes below seven percent total than
 
05:44:07.670 --> 05:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
it is in statute that the employee rate
 
05:44:10.430 --> 05:44:10.440 align:start position:0%
will be adjusted so that they the
 
05:44:12.770 --> 05:44:12.780 align:start position:0%
employer rate will never go below the
 
05:44:14.570 --> 05:44:14.580 align:start position:0%
employee rate or
 
05:44:19.310 --> 05:44:19.320 align:start position:0%
yeah so that that's something that it's
 
05:44:22.010 --> 05:44:22.020 align:start position:0%
another 15 years out so we can ignore it
 
05:44:24.110 --> 05:44:24.120 align:start position:0%
for this week that was the risk sharing
 
05:44:27.410 --> 05:44:27.420 align:start position:0%
piece that I was referencing yes
 
05:44:30.230 --> 05:44:30.240 align:start position:0%
all right anyone else represent goalie
 
05:44:32.330 --> 05:44:32.340 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair Marty thank you
 
05:44:35.090 --> 05:44:35.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:38.390 --> 05:44:38.400 align:start position:0%
so we're looking at the difference of
 
05:44:40.850 --> 05:44:40.860 align:start position:0%
the employer paying the same rate that
 
05:44:41.990 --> 05:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
they would whether it's defined
 
05:44:43.670 --> 05:44:43.680 align:start position:0%
contribution to fine benefit we're
 
05:44:46.368 --> 05:44:46.378 align:start position:0%
looking at a plan difference correct
 
05:44:49.070 --> 05:44:49.080 align:start position:0%
yeah the the the the I think the stated
 
05:44:51.890 --> 05:44:51.900 align:start position:0%
intent despite the text was that the
 
05:44:53.090 --> 05:44:53.100 align:start position:0%
state would be paying the same
 
05:44:55.910 --> 05:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
percentage of pay for folks in the DC
 
05:44:57.350 --> 05:44:57.360 align:start position:0%
plan as they're currently paying for
 
05:44:59.270 --> 05:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
folks in the DB plan
 
05:45:01.670 --> 05:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
and that would mean that defined benefit
 
05:45:04.250 --> 05:45:04.260 align:start position:0%
versus defined contribution is
 
05:45:06.708 --> 05:45:06.718 align:start position:0%
defined benefit
 
05:45:09.650 --> 05:45:09.660 align:start position:0%
the risk is on the employer not the
 
05:45:11.330 --> 05:45:11.340 align:start position:0%
employee who has to worry about the
 
05:45:13.250 --> 05:45:13.260 align:start position:0%
market going up and down come time if
 
05:45:15.110 --> 05:45:15.120 align:start position:0%
they're looking to retire on a year like
 
05:45:17.270 --> 05:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
last year when the market tanked 20
 
05:45:19.788 --> 05:45:19.798 align:start position:0%
percent debating whether or not they
 
05:45:21.470 --> 05:45:21.480 align:start position:0%
have to hold off a year or two to recoup
 
05:45:23.390 --> 05:45:23.400 align:start position:0%
their money that they would get the
 
05:45:25.430 --> 05:45:25.440 align:start position:0%
benefit in a defined benefit versus the
 
05:45:28.128 --> 05:45:28.138 align:start position:0%
fine contribution correct yes thank you
 
05:45:30.430 --> 05:45:30.440 align:start position:0%
okay other questions
 
05:45:32.690 --> 05:45:32.700 align:start position:0%
representative shewitt
 
05:45:34.970 --> 05:45:34.980 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
05:45:34.980 --> 05:45:35.650 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
um

05:45:35.650 --> 05:45:35.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:45:39.830 --> 05:45:39.840 align:start position:0%
the impetus on this bill is employees
 
05:45:43.730 --> 05:45:43.740 align:start position:0%
going forward but my concern is current
 
05:45:48.110 --> 05:45:48.120 align:start position:0%
employees who are in defined benefit and
 
05:45:50.830 --> 05:45:50.840 align:start position:0%
current retirees
 
05:45:54.230 --> 05:45:54.240 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming the way that the current
 
05:45:58.070 --> 05:45:58.080 align:start position:0%
plan works the contributions similar to
 
05:46:00.530 --> 05:46:00.540 align:start position:0%
social security cover the people that
 
05:46:06.048 --> 05:46:06.058 align:start position:0%
are employee I'm sorry retired because
 
05:46:10.490 --> 05:46:10.500 align:start position:0%
the expenses generally get higher due to
 
05:46:14.930 --> 05:46:14.940 align:start position:0%
inflation how do you see funding for
 
05:46:18.590 --> 05:46:18.600 align:start position:0%
retirees in the defined benefits plan
 
05:46:21.948 --> 05:46:21.958 align:start position:0%
going forward if all the new funds are
 
05:46:24.410 --> 05:46:24.420 align:start position:0%
going towards the new employees
 
05:46:25.930 --> 05:46:25.940 align:start position:0%
but if
 
05:46:28.730 --> 05:46:28.740 align:start position:0%
since none of the new employees would be
 
05:46:32.628 --> 05:46:32.638 align:start position:0%
accruing benefits in nhrs if the state
 
05:46:35.150 --> 05:46:35.160 align:start position:0%
is committed to paying the unfunded rate
 
05:46:38.330 --> 05:46:38.340 align:start position:0%
going forward they're they're using that
 
05:46:41.030 --> 05:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
the covered payroll of the folks not in
 
05:46:43.910 --> 05:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
the plan to to
 
05:46:46.368 --> 05:46:46.378 align:start position:0%
pay down the unfunded as if they were in
 
05:46:50.510 --> 05:46:50.520 align:start position:0%
the plan so you know so it you know it
 
05:46:53.048 --> 05:46:53.058 align:start position:0%
you know that it's they're they're
 
05:46:55.548 --> 05:46:55.558 align:start position:0%
substituting well substituting they're
 
05:46:57.530 --> 05:46:57.540 align:start position:0%
still meeting their obligation toward
 
05:46:59.510 --> 05:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
the unfunded and that that's what those
 
05:47:01.010 --> 05:47:01.020 align:start position:0%
are the benefits that are accrued by
 
05:47:03.350 --> 05:47:03.360 align:start position:0%
people already so you know as long as
 
05:47:05.690 --> 05:47:05.700 align:start position:0%
that the state's commitment to pay that
 
05:47:08.390 --> 05:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
unfunded rate goes forward you know we
 
05:47:10.128 --> 05:47:10.138 align:start position:0%
can you know it you know like I said
 
05:47:12.230 --> 05:47:12.240 align:start position:0%
there may be some you know marginal
 
05:47:14.690 --> 05:47:14.700 align:start position:0%
impacts on the size of the active member
 
05:47:16.250 --> 05:47:16.260 align:start position:0%
population things like that but the
 
05:47:18.530 --> 05:47:18.540 align:start position:0%
actuator would have to look at that and
 
05:47:20.270 --> 05:47:20.280 align:start position:0%
tell me about them because I you know
 
05:47:22.250 --> 05:47:22.260 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure what there may be and you
 
05:47:23.750 --> 05:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
know it's
 
05:47:25.430 --> 05:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
um you know there you know there could
 
05:47:27.708 --> 05:47:27.718 align:start position:0%
be other again like sort of
 
05:47:29.510 --> 05:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
esoteric factors that would have some
 
05:47:31.310 --> 05:47:31.320 align:start position:0%
impact on funding but you know right now
 
05:47:33.590 --> 05:47:33.600 align:start position:0%
we're not aware of any but you know we
 
05:47:33.600 --> 05:47:34.730 align:start position:0%
we're not aware of any but you know we
would

05:47:34.730 --> 05:47:34.740 align:start position:0%
would
 
05:47:37.610 --> 05:47:37.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:40.250 --> 05:47:40.260 align:start position:0%
okay represent goalie thank you madam
 
05:47:42.230 --> 05:47:42.240 align:start position:0%
chair just one more quick question as we
 
05:47:45.530 --> 05:47:45.540 align:start position:0%
go about employer rates and where we are
 
05:47:47.868 --> 05:47:47.878 align:start position:0%
with the unfunded approved liability I I
 
05:47:50.030 --> 05:47:50.040 align:start position:0%
think I've heard a lot of agreement
 
05:47:52.970 --> 05:47:52.980 align:start position:0%
amongst those who testified earlier that
 
05:47:54.890 --> 05:47:54.900 align:start position:0%
the unfunded accrued liability was
 
05:47:57.410 --> 05:47:57.420 align:start position:0%
because of actions here of this of the
 
05:48:00.288 --> 05:48:00.298 align:start position:0%
legislature and decisions that they had
 
05:48:02.270 --> 05:48:02.280 align:start position:0%
made previously leading up to that
 
05:48:05.448 --> 05:48:05.458 align:start position:0%
correct plus the market Behavior yeah I
 
05:48:07.430 --> 05:48:07.440 align:start position:0%
I that's I think that represents the
 
05:48:09.830 --> 05:48:09.840 align:start position:0%
testimony there are other factors that
 
05:48:12.770 --> 05:48:12.780 align:start position:0%
led to where we are you know in in terms
 
05:48:14.930 --> 05:48:14.940 align:start position:0%
of 2007 versus
 
05:48:17.448 --> 05:48:17.458 align:start position:0%
um 2021 and I don't I don't I I
 
05:48:19.190 --> 05:48:19.200 align:start position:0%
appreciate representative McGuire wasn't
 
05:48:21.650 --> 05:48:21.660 align:start position:0%
making an Apples to Apples but you know
 
05:48:24.288 --> 05:48:24.298 align:start position:0%
that was June 30th of 2007 so that was
 
05:48:27.470 --> 05:48:27.480 align:start position:0%
before the great financial crisis uh and
 
05:48:28.850 --> 05:48:28.860 align:start position:0%
before we lower the assumed rate of
 
05:48:31.490 --> 05:48:31.500 align:start position:0%
return three times and made a
 
05:48:33.590 --> 05:48:33.600 align:start position:0%
proportionate reduction to our payroll
 
05:48:35.930 --> 05:48:35.940 align:start position:0%
growth assumption at those three
 
05:48:38.208 --> 05:48:38.218 align:start position:0%
junctures so you know it for
 
05:48:40.010 --> 05:48:40.020 align:start position:0%
illustrative purposes yes assumptions
 
05:48:42.230 --> 05:48:42.240 align:start position:0%
change and you know he made that point
 
05:48:44.690 --> 05:48:44.700 align:start position:0%
that was that was accurate but a lot has
 
05:48:46.548 --> 05:48:46.558 align:start position:0%
happened since you know then and that
 
05:48:48.650 --> 05:48:48.660 align:start position:0%
that's you know there were policy
 
05:48:50.570 --> 05:48:50.580 align:start position:0%
decisions in the 80s and 90s that
 
05:48:53.510 --> 05:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
started building up the liability but
 
05:48:55.970 --> 05:48:55.980 align:start position:0%
then we've had other other you know
 
05:48:58.250 --> 05:48:58.260 align:start position:0%
Market issues and other and lowering the
 
05:48:59.330 --> 05:48:59.340 align:start position:0%
assume rate of return which is
 
05:49:01.510 --> 05:49:01.520 align:start position:0%
essentially becoming more conservative
 
05:49:04.310 --> 05:49:04.320 align:start position:0%
and being less risky we're charging the
 
05:49:05.628 --> 05:49:05.638 align:start position:0%
employers up you know paying us now
 
05:49:07.610 --> 05:49:07.620 align:start position:0%
instead of paying us later
 
05:49:09.170 --> 05:49:09.180 align:start position:0%
um you know with that so we would argue
 
05:49:10.670 --> 05:49:10.680 align:start position:0%
that that's that's a sound approach and
 
05:49:13.190 --> 05:49:13.200 align:start position:0%
it also reflects you know the decline
 
05:49:13.200 --> 05:49:14.150 align:start position:0%
it also reflects you know the decline
and

05:49:14.150 --> 05:49:14.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:49:16.010 --> 05:49:16.020 align:start position:0%
um you know the value of fixed income
 
05:49:18.170 --> 05:49:18.180 align:start position:0%
Investments over the last 15 to 20 years
 
05:49:20.390 --> 05:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
interest rates had inflation we're have
 
05:49:22.850 --> 05:49:22.860 align:start position:0%
we're seeing inflation now finally but
 
05:49:25.368 --> 05:49:25.378 align:start position:0%
um you know the interest rates on you
 
05:49:27.530 --> 05:49:27.540 align:start position:0%
know bonds who are at record lows for
 
05:49:29.270 --> 05:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
you know more you know the better part
 
05:49:31.430 --> 05:49:31.440 align:start position:0%
of 15 years so that another reason why
 
05:49:32.930 --> 05:49:32.940 align:start position:0%
we had to ratchet down the assumed rate
 
05:49:34.670 --> 05:49:34.680 align:start position:0%
of return a lot of
 
05:49:37.010 --> 05:49:37.020 align:start position:0%
consumer rate of return and things like
 
05:49:38.868 --> 05:49:38.878 align:start position:0%
that are all Market dependent you know I
 
05:49:42.110 --> 05:49:42.120 align:start position:0%
didn't look up you know 1970 to 2001 how
 
05:49:44.090 --> 05:49:44.100 align:start position:0%
the Dow did you know and representative
 
05:49:45.890 --> 05:49:45.900 align:start position:0%
Weiler's career but you know somebody
 
05:49:48.350 --> 05:49:48.360 align:start position:0%
who started in 1975 and retired in all
 
05:49:49.368 --> 05:49:49.378 align:start position:0%
five it might have been different it
 
05:49:50.690 --> 05:49:50.700 align:start position:0%
might have been better might have been
 
05:49:52.310 --> 05:49:52.320 align:start position:0%
worse but there's there's a lot of
 
05:49:54.830 --> 05:49:54.840 align:start position:0%
endpoint dependency on when you have
 
05:49:56.990 --> 05:49:57.000 align:start position:0%
your Investments invested and where you
 
05:50:00.048 --> 05:50:00.058 align:start position:0%
have what buckets you put them in
 
05:50:00.058 --> 05:50:00.788 align:start position:0%
have what buckets you put them in
um

05:50:00.788 --> 05:50:00.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:50:03.470 --> 05:50:03.480 align:start position:0%
and where I'm going with this is as not
 
05:50:03.480 --> 05:50:04.910 align:start position:0%
and where I'm going with this is as not
this

05:50:04.910 --> 05:50:04.920 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:50:06.830 --> 05:50:06.840 align:start position:0%
what has not
 
05:50:09.948 --> 05:50:09.958 align:start position:0%
pass legislatures legislation helped out
 
05:50:11.868 --> 05:50:11.878 align:start position:0%
the employer rates by smoothing and
 
05:50:13.548 --> 05:50:13.558 align:start position:0%
getting rid of spiking and some of those
 
05:50:16.430 --> 05:50:16.440 align:start position:0%
increments that has eased the up and
 
05:50:19.548 --> 05:50:19.558 align:start position:0%
down flows of employer rates yes there's
 
05:50:22.670 --> 05:50:22.680 align:start position:0%
a lot of you know you know putting aside
 
05:50:24.170 --> 05:50:24.180 align:start position:0%
the benefit changes which we talked a
 
05:50:25.368 --> 05:50:25.378 align:start position:0%
lot about this morning there were a lot
 
05:50:28.010 --> 05:50:28.020 align:start position:0%
of foundational about Actuarial funding
 
05:50:30.410 --> 05:50:30.420 align:start position:0%
you know amortization periods layout
 
05:50:32.810 --> 05:50:32.820 align:start position:0%
amortization smoothing you know that
 
05:50:35.448 --> 05:50:35.458 align:start position:0%
that you know would you know the goal is
 
05:50:37.730 --> 05:50:37.740 align:start position:0%
to stabilize employer rates and you know
 
05:50:40.010 --> 05:50:40.020 align:start position:0%
we would never say that all assumptions
 
05:50:42.830 --> 05:50:42.840 align:start position:0%
are going to be met every year but what
 
05:50:45.170 --> 05:50:45.180 align:start position:0%
the expectation is if you know they are
 
05:50:47.628 --> 05:50:47.638 align:start position:0%
close you know on some are better than
 
05:50:49.788 --> 05:50:49.798 align:start position:0%
others the employer contribution rates
 
05:50:52.128 --> 05:50:52.138 align:start position:0%
we're seeing now will be relatively
 
05:50:54.708 --> 05:50:54.718 align:start position:0%
stable as a percent of pay through 2039
 
05:50:56.570 --> 05:50:56.580 align:start position:0%
that's the goal
 
05:50:58.070 --> 05:50:58.080 align:start position:0%
um you know we would when if we had to
 
05:50:59.390 --> 05:50:59.400 align:start position:0%
lower the assume rate of return that
 
05:51:01.910 --> 05:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
would push them up but if we if we could
 
05:51:03.948 --> 05:51:03.958 align:start position:0%
keep all of our assumptions in place and
 
05:51:05.570 --> 05:51:05.580 align:start position:0%
they were they tracked you know
 
05:51:07.490 --> 05:51:07.500 align:start position:0%
reasonably with reality you know rates
 
05:51:11.150 --> 05:51:11.160 align:start position:0%
aren't going to go down until 2040.
 
05:51:13.788 --> 05:51:13.798 align:start position:0%
um you know because 5 billion of the 5.7
 
05:51:17.270 --> 05:51:17.280 align:start position:0%
is is on a pay down by 2039 but that's
 
05:51:20.390 --> 05:51:20.400 align:start position:0%
the way it's you know that it's and
 
05:51:22.190 --> 05:51:22.200 align:start position:0%
drawn up on paper you know and then when
 
05:51:24.110 --> 05:51:24.120 align:start position:0%
you run the play you know maybe you have
 
05:51:25.310 --> 05:51:25.320 align:start position:0%
to you know break off the route or
 
05:51:27.350 --> 05:51:27.360 align:start position:0%
something and and things change but that
 
05:51:30.048 --> 05:51:30.058 align:start position:0%
that's that's the goal of the funding
 
05:51:31.670 --> 05:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
method we're on now and that that
 
05:51:34.250 --> 05:51:34.260 align:start position:0%
funding method also was back loaded as
 
05:51:37.190 --> 05:51:37.200 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire mentioned so the
 
05:51:39.530 --> 05:51:39.540 align:start position:0%
first 10 or 12 years we weren't even
 
05:51:41.270 --> 05:51:41.280 align:start position:0%
paying off the interest on the unfunded
 
05:51:43.030 --> 05:51:43.040 align:start position:0%
we just hit that crossover point in 21
 
05:51:45.708 --> 05:51:45.718 align:start position:0%
so we'll be seeing bigger chunks coming
 
05:51:45.718 --> 05:51:46.670 align:start position:0%
so we'll be seeing bigger chunks coming
off

05:51:46.670 --> 05:51:46.680 align:start position:0%
off
 
05:51:52.670 --> 05:51:52.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:55.010 --> 05:51:55.020 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair so as I
 
05:51:56.208 --> 05:51:56.218 align:start position:0%
understand it
 
05:51:56.218 --> 05:51:57.590 align:start position:0%
understand it
um

05:51:57.590 --> 05:51:57.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:52:00.830 --> 05:52:00.840 align:start position:0%
the new employees that only they have
 
05:52:02.030 --> 05:52:02.040 align:start position:0%
the option
 
05:52:04.910 --> 05:52:04.920 align:start position:0%
or maybe they don't the option for the
 
05:52:07.430 --> 05:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
defined contribution plan
 
05:52:09.708 --> 05:52:09.718 align:start position:0%
but they will not have an option to join
 
05:52:12.470 --> 05:52:12.480 align:start position:0%
the defined benefit plan is that correct
 
05:52:14.208 --> 05:52:14.218 align:start position:0%
um if I'll I'll speak for state
 
05:52:14.218 --> 05:52:15.230 align:start position:0%
um if I'll I'll speak for state
employees

05:52:15.230 --> 05:52:15.240 align:start position:0%
employees
 
05:52:16.670 --> 05:52:16.680 align:start position:0%
um you know because the bill refers to
 
05:52:19.070 --> 05:52:19.080 align:start position:0%
that right now uh full-time permanent
 
05:52:21.650 --> 05:52:21.660 align:start position:0%
employees state employees are in
 
05:52:25.128 --> 05:52:25.138 align:start position:0%
mandatory enrollment in nhrs there is a
 
05:52:27.948 --> 05:52:27.958 align:start position:0%
deferred plan that Mr Downing will speak
 
05:52:30.470 --> 05:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
about and uh and all employees at any
 
05:52:32.208 --> 05:52:32.218 align:start position:0%
stage of their career including at the
 
05:52:34.490 --> 05:52:34.500 align:start position:0%
beginning have the option to participate
 
05:52:36.470 --> 05:52:36.480 align:start position:0%
in that plan tape you know take you know
 
05:52:39.590 --> 05:52:39.600 align:start position:0%
payroll deductions in in that um it's a
 
05:52:41.448 --> 05:52:41.458 align:start position:0%
457 but it's essentially a defined
 
05:52:43.310 --> 05:52:43.320 align:start position:0%
contribution the member chooses the
 
05:52:45.350 --> 05:52:45.360 align:start position:0%
allocation and there's a you know so
 
05:52:47.090 --> 05:52:47.100 align:start position:0%
that that's the current landscape for
 
05:52:50.030 --> 05:52:50.040 align:start position:0%
state employees now follow up is it is
 
05:52:52.548 --> 05:52:52.558 align:start position:0%
there any plan or thoughts to say that
 
05:52:55.730 --> 05:52:55.740 align:start position:0%
at some point there will no longer be a
 
05:52:57.650 --> 05:52:57.660 align:start position:0%
defined benefit plan and your only
 
05:53:00.110 --> 05:53:00.120 align:start position:0%
option as an employee is the defined
 
05:53:03.650 --> 05:53:03.660 align:start position:0%
contribution this this bill says that if
 
05:53:08.628 --> 05:53:08.638 align:start position:0%
you're hired after July 1st 2024 that is
 
05:53:13.670 --> 05:53:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:16.670 --> 05:53:16.680 align:start position:0%
okay any any other questions
 
05:53:19.788 --> 05:53:19.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:50.090 --> 05:53:50.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:59.410 --> 05:53:59.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:04.010 --> 05:54:04.020 align:start position:0%
Madam chairman yes Excuse me yes foreign
 
05:54:05.390 --> 05:54:05.400 align:start position:0%
thank you man if you have a question to
 
05:54:07.128 --> 05:54:07.138 align:start position:0%
the chair
 
05:54:09.770 --> 05:54:09.780 align:start position:0%
is talking about state employees and
 
05:54:09.780 --> 05:54:11.090 align:start position:0%
is talking about state employees and
because

05:54:11.090 --> 05:54:11.100 align:start position:0%
because
 
05:54:14.510 --> 05:54:14.520 align:start position:0%
towns uh division of the state
 
05:54:17.270 --> 05:54:17.280 align:start position:0%
no this would not include Municipal
 
05:54:19.788 --> 05:54:19.798 align:start position:0%
Employees as written and the intent is
 
05:54:22.690 --> 05:54:22.700 align:start position:0%
to start it up with the state and
 
05:54:26.048 --> 05:54:26.058 align:start position:0%
possibly offer an option for the
 
05:54:29.270 --> 05:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
municipalities to enroll their
 
05:54:31.490 --> 05:54:31.500 align:start position:0%
uh employees if they wish but other
 
05:54:36.590 --> 05:54:36.600 align:start position:0%
employees I mean police by a teachers
 
05:54:39.948 --> 05:54:39.958 align:start position:0%
at the moment it is only for state
 
05:54:42.708 --> 05:54:42.718 align:start position:0%
government employees which is does not
 
05:54:44.750 --> 05:54:44.760 align:start position:0%
include teachers
 
05:54:49.250 --> 05:54:49.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:51.708 --> 05:54:51.718 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Madam chairman uh
 
05:54:53.390 --> 05:54:53.400 align:start position:0%
actually a pleasure to be here because
 
05:54:54.948 --> 05:54:54.958 align:start position:0%
the last time I was scheduled to testify
 
05:54:57.350 --> 05:54:57.360 align:start position:0%
I ended up getting coveted and and
 
05:55:00.230 --> 05:55:00.240 align:start position:0%
didn't so I'm happy to be here uh rather
 
05:55:02.270 --> 05:55:02.280 align:start position:0%
than uh between somewhere between the
 
05:55:04.250 --> 05:55:04.260 align:start position:0%
floor and the couch
 
05:55:07.490 --> 05:55:07.500 align:start position:0%
um I had some input with representative
 
05:55:09.830 --> 05:55:09.840 align:start position:0%
McGuire on the original Bill like
 
05:55:12.650 --> 05:55:12.660 align:start position:0%
everyone else I got that at 5 50 last
 
05:55:16.730 --> 05:55:16.740 align:start position:0%
night so I have not had the benefit of
 
05:55:19.788 --> 05:55:19.798 align:start position:0%
uh discussion with Council and right now
 
05:55:22.010 --> 05:55:22.020 align:start position:0%
as executive director of the Deferred
 
05:55:24.410 --> 05:55:24.420 align:start position:0%
Compensation commission and in
 
05:55:26.690 --> 05:55:26.700 align:start position:0%
consultation with the chairman of the
 
05:55:28.910 --> 05:55:28.920 align:start position:0%
commission right now we take no position
 
05:55:32.090 --> 05:55:32.100 align:start position:0%
but we may in the future yeah uh I the
 
05:55:34.430 --> 05:55:34.440 align:start position:0%
reason I called you at this point is to
 
05:55:36.350 --> 05:55:36.360 align:start position:0%
answer any questions the committee may
 
05:55:38.150 --> 05:55:38.160 align:start position:0%
have about how the
 
05:55:41.208 --> 05:55:41.218 align:start position:0%
defined con your Deferred Compensation
 
05:55:43.788 --> 05:55:43.798 align:start position:0%
Plan works because it's an integral part
 
05:55:47.150 --> 05:55:47.160 align:start position:0%
of the bill as amended and so I'm sure
 
05:55:48.890 --> 05:55:48.900 align:start position:0%
there are questions
 
05:55:51.110 --> 05:55:51.120 align:start position:0%
representative Dolan for example has one
 
05:55:53.930 --> 05:55:53.940 align:start position:0%
right now yes thank you madam chair uh
 
05:55:56.510 --> 05:55:56.520 align:start position:0%
then my question that I was hitting at
 
05:55:56.520 --> 05:55:57.610 align:start position:0%
then my question that I was hitting at
earlier

05:55:57.610 --> 05:55:57.620 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
05:56:01.788 --> 05:56:01.798 align:start position:0%
was the any guarantees or any what
 
05:56:01.798 --> 05:56:03.110 align:start position:0%
was the any guarantees or any what
security

05:56:03.110 --> 05:56:03.120 align:start position:0%
security
 
05:56:07.128 --> 05:56:07.138 align:start position:0%
do employees have that join the
 
05:56:09.350 --> 05:56:09.360 align:start position:0%
um Define contribution plan that they're
 
05:56:10.730 --> 05:56:10.740 align:start position:0%
actually going to get their money that
 
05:56:14.448 --> 05:56:14.458 align:start position:0%
they're not at the at some risk
 
05:56:16.310 --> 05:56:16.320 align:start position:0%
um the the situation that I believe
 
05:56:19.070 --> 05:56:19.080 align:start position:0%
you're referring to is is if the and it
 
05:56:20.690 --> 05:56:20.700 align:start position:0%
this will go out to a third party
 
05:56:23.208 --> 05:56:23.218 align:start position:0%
administrator the state is not going to
 
05:56:25.910 --> 05:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
create a record-keeping system
 
05:56:28.490 --> 05:56:28.500 align:start position:0%
um even large states like Florida and
 
05:56:31.970 --> 05:56:31.980 align:start position:0%
Texas they they Farm these plans out
 
05:56:36.048 --> 05:56:36.058 align:start position:0%
um so in the event of say a insurance
 
05:56:38.270 --> 05:56:38.280 align:start position:0%
company a who's The Record Keeper they
 
05:56:39.708 --> 05:56:39.718 align:start position:0%
go Belly Up
 
05:56:42.048 --> 05:56:42.058 align:start position:0%
you're protected the Assets in the plan
 
05:56:44.090 --> 05:56:44.100 align:start position:0%
the employee assets are protected
 
05:56:46.190 --> 05:56:46.200 align:start position:0%
because it's in a custodial agreement or
 
05:56:48.470 --> 05:56:48.480 align:start position:0%
a trustee agreement it's kept separate
 
05:56:52.010 --> 05:56:52.020 align:start position:0%
and is not a part of any obligation of
 
05:56:56.330 --> 05:56:56.340 align:start position:0%
the insurance company so if if there's
 
05:56:58.490 --> 05:56:58.500 align:start position:0%
no money held within the insurance
 
05:57:02.090 --> 05:57:02.100 align:start position:0%
company that could be subject to claims
 
05:57:04.788 --> 05:57:04.798 align:start position:0%
there are also Federal Insurance
 
05:57:08.270 --> 05:57:08.280 align:start position:0%
programs for brokerages and insurance
 
05:57:10.548 --> 05:57:10.558 align:start position:0%
companies to
 
05:57:12.770 --> 05:57:12.780 align:start position:0%
make sure that if there was a theft
 
05:57:14.868 --> 05:57:14.878 align:start position:0%
involved the
 
05:57:17.930 --> 05:57:17.940 align:start position:0%
people who entrusted their money to that
 
05:57:21.650 --> 05:57:21.660 align:start position:0%
business would get that money back
 
05:57:23.930 --> 05:57:23.940 align:start position:0%
I I have a
 
05:57:27.190 --> 05:57:27.200 align:start position:0%
a story if you will similar to
 
05:57:30.650 --> 05:57:30.660 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler's story he had to
 
05:57:32.208 --> 05:57:32.218 align:start position:0%
leave up evidently
 
05:57:36.530 --> 05:57:36.540 align:start position:0%
but I have a American Airlines
 
05:57:36.540 --> 05:57:38.390 align:start position:0%
but I have a American Airlines
uh

05:57:38.390 --> 05:57:38.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:57:41.690 --> 05:57:41.700 align:start position:0%
friend who has gone through his
 
05:57:45.770 --> 05:57:45.780 align:start position:0%
retirement system and had money in it to
 
05:57:49.368 --> 05:57:49.378 align:start position:0%
find a contribution plan but also a lot
 
05:57:50.930 --> 05:57:50.940 align:start position:0%
of his money was
 
05:57:53.750 --> 05:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
or his retirement was staked in a
 
05:57:56.150 --> 05:57:56.160 align:start position:0%
defined benefit plan
 
05:57:56.160 --> 05:57:57.590 align:start position:0%
defined benefit plan
now

05:57:57.590 --> 05:57:57.600 align:start position:0%
now
 
05:58:00.170 --> 05:58:00.180 align:start position:0%
he lost the money in the defined
 
05:58:02.570 --> 05:58:02.580 align:start position:0%
contribution plan through
 
05:58:05.628 --> 05:58:05.638 align:start position:0%
a messy divorce which I don't want to
 
05:58:07.548 --> 05:58:07.558 align:start position:0%
get into social Engineers beyond our
 
05:58:07.558 --> 05:58:08.530 align:start position:0%
get into social Engineers beyond our
scope

05:58:08.530 --> 05:58:08.540 align:start position:0%
scope
 
05:58:11.270 --> 05:58:11.280 align:start position:0%
my question is
 
05:58:14.150 --> 05:58:14.160 align:start position:0%
do we are we going to be offering any
 
05:58:18.890 --> 05:58:18.900 align:start position:0%
protection or uh it you know if if a
 
05:58:22.010 --> 05:58:22.020 align:start position:0%
defined benefit plan goes away
 
05:58:25.128 --> 05:58:25.138 align:start position:0%
and the defined Compensation Plan is
 
05:58:28.250 --> 05:58:28.260 align:start position:0%
eaten up by some social event
 
05:58:30.288 --> 05:58:30.298 align:start position:0%
what you know
 
05:58:33.590 --> 05:58:33.600 align:start position:0%
our employees can uh really get jobs at
 
05:58:35.288 --> 05:58:35.298 align:start position:0%
the local grocery store but what what
 
05:58:38.208 --> 05:58:38.218 align:start position:0%
beyond that is the disaster scenario
 
05:58:41.390 --> 05:58:41.400 align:start position:0%
protection for them uh or are we going
 
05:58:44.150 --> 05:58:44.160 align:start position:0%
to build anything into our defined
 
05:58:47.510 --> 05:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
contribution plans that will not put the
 
05:58:50.270 --> 05:58:50.280 align:start position:0%
entire plan at risk for a social issue
 
05:58:54.650 --> 05:58:54.660 align:start position:0%
like a divorce or whatever well if if I
 
05:58:56.270 --> 05:58:56.280 align:start position:0%
was married and got a divorce I'm in the
 
05:58:57.650 --> 05:58:57.660 align:start position:0%
pension plan
 
05:58:57.660 --> 05:58:59.208 align:start position:0%
pension plan
um

05:58:59.208 --> 05:58:59.218 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:59:01.670 --> 05:59:01.680 align:start position:0%
my my spouse is going to get a cut of
 
05:59:01.680 --> 05:59:02.628 align:start position:0%
my my spouse is going to get a cut of
that

05:59:02.628 --> 05:59:02.638 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:59:05.810 --> 05:59:05.820 align:start position:0%
so there's no there's no protection from
 
05:59:09.170 --> 05:59:09.180 align:start position:0%
that I mean that's up to a judge
 
05:59:12.048 --> 05:59:12.058 align:start position:0%
um and you know Divorce Court the judges
 
05:59:15.230 --> 05:59:15.240 align:start position:0%
can in the case of a divorce allocate
 
05:59:17.510 --> 05:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
either a defined benefit or a defined
 
05:59:19.490 --> 05:59:19.500 align:start position:0%
contribution plan
 
05:59:22.670 --> 05:59:22.680 align:start position:0%
and it has happened they call it Quadro
 
05:59:24.590 --> 05:59:24.600 align:start position:0%
it's qualified
 
05:59:24.600 --> 05:59:26.030 align:start position:0%
it's qualified
uh

05:59:26.030 --> 05:59:26.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:59:28.788 --> 05:59:28.798 align:start position:0%
court ordered distribution and you know
 
05:59:31.430 --> 05:59:31.440 align:start position:0%
there's there's a there's a uh division
 
05:59:32.628 --> 05:59:32.638 align:start position:0%
of assets
 
05:59:34.788 --> 05:59:34.798 align:start position:0%
and that's subject to our plan in fact
 
05:59:37.850 --> 05:59:37.860 align:start position:0%
any retirement plan uh is subject to
 
05:59:42.048 --> 05:59:42.058 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:50.448 --> 05:59:50.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:53.330 --> 05:59:53.340 align:start position:0%
uh I have one representing from a former
 
05:59:55.128 --> 05:59:55.138 align:start position:0%
state employee who'd like to testify his
 
06:00:00.530 --> 06:00:00.540 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:01.730 --> 06:00:01.740 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
06:00:03.948 --> 06:00:03.958 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
06:00:05.990 --> 06:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
answer thank you
 
06:00:08.810 --> 06:00:08.820 align:start position:0%
um I'm since
 
06:00:11.390 --> 06:00:11.400 align:start position:0%
I don't mean to put you on the spot go
 
06:00:11.400 --> 06:00:13.730 align:start position:0%
I don't mean to put you on the spot go
ahead

06:00:13.730 --> 06:00:13.740 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:18.770 --> 06:00:18.780 align:start position:0%
um I recall we've heard the mention that
 
06:00:21.830 --> 06:00:21.840 align:start position:0%
there would be startup costs to this
 
06:00:23.990 --> 06:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
which I assume would be borne by the
 
06:00:29.090 --> 06:00:29.100 align:start position:0%
state I recall when a plan going to
 
06:00:32.590 --> 06:00:32.600 align:start position:0%
Define contribution was
 
06:00:36.288 --> 06:00:36.298 align:start position:0%
proposed previously that the startup
 
06:00:39.530 --> 06:00:39.540 align:start position:0%
costs were so huge that that was
 
06:00:43.190 --> 06:00:43.200 align:start position:0%
basically why it was discarded at that
 
06:00:46.750 --> 06:00:46.760 align:start position:0%
time do you recall what that amount was
 
06:00:50.270 --> 06:00:50.280 align:start position:0%
uh representative shewitt okay I recall
 
06:00:52.910 --> 06:00:52.920 align:start position:0%
that when we considered it and we were
 
06:00:55.310 --> 06:00:55.320 align:start position:0%
contemplating closing the defined
 
06:00:59.510 --> 06:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
benefit plan that caused a major charge
 
06:01:03.230 --> 06:01:03.240 align:start position:0%
to the defined benefit plan because it
 
06:01:05.030 --> 06:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
was assumed that since they would not be
 
06:01:07.970 --> 06:01:07.980 align:start position:0%
getting any new contributions they would
 
06:01:12.350 --> 06:01:12.360 align:start position:0%
have to invest more conservatively to
 
06:01:15.708 --> 06:01:15.718 align:start position:0%
make make the payouts that is
 
06:01:17.750 --> 06:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
which was turned out to be a
 
06:01:20.510 --> 06:01:20.520 align:start position:0%
tremendously large number that is not
 
06:01:23.628 --> 06:01:23.638 align:start position:0%
relevant because this bill only takes
 
06:01:26.990 --> 06:01:27.000 align:start position:0%
off a portion of the employees the
 
06:01:31.128 --> 06:01:31.138 align:start position:0%
defined benefit plan is still in
 
06:01:34.670 --> 06:01:34.680 align:start position:0%
in existence it's still being funded new
 
06:01:37.430 --> 06:01:37.440 align:start position:0%
teachers new firemen Etc are being added
 
06:01:40.128 --> 06:01:40.138 align:start position:0%
all the time so it is not a closed
 
06:01:44.810 --> 06:01:44.820 align:start position:0%
system and those costs do not apply
 
06:01:48.970 --> 06:01:48.980 align:start position:0%
okay and I I remember that pretty well
 
06:01:52.610 --> 06:01:52.620 align:start position:0%
it's different costs so because that
 
06:01:56.510 --> 06:01:56.520 align:start position:0%
prior bill was a mandatory join the 457
 
06:02:00.650 --> 06:02:00.660 align:start position:0%
plan 457 plan all expenses right now
 
06:02:04.128 --> 06:02:04.138 align:start position:0%
we're able to pay uh afforded by the
 
06:02:05.570 --> 06:02:05.580 align:start position:0%
participants in the plan there's no
 
06:02:07.150 --> 06:02:07.160 align:start position:0%
State money involved
 
06:02:11.208 --> 06:02:11.218 align:start position:0%
so that was just that was just putting
 
06:02:14.090 --> 06:02:14.100 align:start position:0%
more participants into the deferred comp
 
06:02:17.570 --> 06:02:17.580 align:start position:0%
plan so the fiscal note we had to do was
 
06:02:19.730 --> 06:02:19.740 align:start position:0%
simply programming the payroll system
 
06:02:22.310 --> 06:02:22.320 align:start position:0%
for mandatory contributions which is
 
06:02:24.830 --> 06:02:24.840 align:start position:0%
something we'd have to do again the cost
 
06:02:27.110 --> 06:02:27.120 align:start position:0%
back then I I believe in the fiscal note
 
06:02:31.910 --> 06:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
was 68 to 80 000 to get it going so
 
06:02:34.548 --> 06:02:34.558 align:start position:0%
those costs that would be a cost on this
 
06:02:35.750 --> 06:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
plan too
 
06:02:37.788 --> 06:02:37.798 align:start position:0%
because of the original language the
 
06:02:41.810 --> 06:02:41.820 align:start position:0%
fiscal note did go to um a retirement
 
06:02:45.110 --> 06:02:45.120 align:start position:0%
system if the chair or some other entity
 
06:02:48.350 --> 06:02:48.360 align:start position:0%
redirects the fiscal note to das to my
 
06:02:50.868 --> 06:02:50.878 align:start position:0%
attention we'd be happy to try to get
 
06:02:54.288 --> 06:02:54.298 align:start position:0%
those uh that and additional costs well
 
06:02:57.948 --> 06:02:57.958 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note will have to be
 
06:03:02.330 --> 06:03:02.340 align:start position:0%
amended at some point when we
 
06:03:04.490 --> 06:03:04.500 align:start position:0%
vote this out of committee which I do
 
06:03:06.410 --> 06:03:06.420 align:start position:0%
not expect to be this week and it may
 
06:03:09.310 --> 06:03:09.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:13.490 --> 06:03:13.500 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to assist all right thank you
 
06:03:15.350 --> 06:03:15.360 align:start position:0%
um it
 
06:03:18.288 --> 06:03:18.298 align:start position:0%
just a a couple of other things that I
 
06:03:21.048 --> 06:03:21.058 align:start position:0%
have I can't say concerns but points of
 
06:03:23.030 --> 06:03:23.040 align:start position:0%
interest I guess at this point
 
06:03:25.010 --> 06:03:25.020 align:start position:0%
if I may please
 
06:03:26.990 --> 06:03:27.000 align:start position:0%
um I thank the sponsor for not putting
 
06:03:29.150 --> 06:03:29.160 align:start position:0%
my name in the bill and just executive
 
06:03:29.160 --> 06:03:30.230 align:start position:0%
my name in the bill and just executive
director

06:03:30.230 --> 06:03:30.240 align:start position:0%
director
 
06:03:32.570 --> 06:03:32.580 align:start position:0%
it's the position not the person yeah
 
06:03:32.580 --> 06:03:34.548 align:start position:0%
it's the position not the person yeah
well

06:03:34.548 --> 06:03:34.558 align:start position:0%
well
 
06:03:34.558 --> 06:03:36.770 align:start position:0%
well
uh

06:03:36.770 --> 06:03:36.780 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:03:39.770 --> 06:03:39.780 align:start position:0%
so I I would first think unlike the
 
06:03:41.510 --> 06:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
pension system
 
06:03:44.510 --> 06:03:44.520 align:start position:0%
the the 457 plan which operates more or
 
06:03:46.030 --> 06:03:46.040 align:start position:0%
less like a
 
06:03:52.970 --> 06:03:52.980 align:start position:0%
401k for for public employees not an IRA
 
06:03:52.980 --> 06:03:53.570 align:start position:0%
401k for for public employees not an IRA
um

06:03:53.570 --> 06:03:53.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:03:56.330 --> 06:03:56.340 align:start position:0%
is is uh it has to have a planned
 
06:03:57.948 --> 06:03:57.958 align:start position:0%
document and so with this because
 
06:04:00.410 --> 06:04:00.420 align:start position:0%
regardless of testimony we are creating
 
06:04:02.930 --> 06:04:02.940 align:start position:0%
a new plan there has to be a new plan
 
06:04:05.868 --> 06:04:05.878 align:start position:0%
for those employer contributions the the
 
06:04:07.730 --> 06:04:07.740 align:start position:0%
testimony is correct that to the
 
06:04:07.740 --> 06:04:09.708 align:start position:0%
testimony is correct that to the
employee

06:04:09.708 --> 06:04:09.718 align:start position:0%
employee
 
06:04:12.048 --> 06:04:12.058 align:start position:0%
um the same company or a compatible
 
06:04:14.690 --> 06:04:14.700 align:start position:0%
company that record keeps the employer
 
06:04:16.850 --> 06:04:16.860 align:start position:0%
contributions is going to be able to
 
06:04:19.128 --> 06:04:19.138 align:start position:0%
show on their defined contribution
 
06:04:22.250 --> 06:04:22.260 align:start position:0%
statements so to the employee there
 
06:04:24.948 --> 06:04:24.958 align:start position:0%
doesn't see much and you do that for two
 
06:04:27.410 --> 06:04:27.420 align:start position:0%
reasons one it just helps the employee
 
06:04:30.708 --> 06:04:30.718 align:start position:0%
if you if you put the employer
 
06:04:34.310 --> 06:04:34.320 align:start position:0%
contribution into the 457 it counts
 
06:04:36.948 --> 06:04:36.958 align:start position:0%
against the limits that the employee can
 
06:04:36.958 --> 06:04:37.788 align:start position:0%
against the limits that the employee can
give

06:04:37.788 --> 06:04:37.798 align:start position:0%
give
 
06:04:41.868 --> 06:04:41.878 align:start position:0%
so you really you're taking away that
 
06:04:45.470 --> 06:04:45.480 align:start position:0%
ability to accelerate the savings
 
06:04:48.890 --> 06:04:48.900 align:start position:0%
uh for them so you you account that in a
 
06:04:50.628 --> 06:04:50.638 align:start position:0%
separate bucket
 
06:04:50.638 --> 06:04:51.530 align:start position:0%
separate bucket
um

06:04:51.530 --> 06:04:51.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:04:55.970 --> 06:04:55.980 align:start position:0%
so just just one point on on
 
06:04:55.980 --> 06:04:57.110 align:start position:0%
so just just one point on on
uh

06:04:57.110 --> 06:04:57.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:04:59.590 --> 06:04:59.600 align:start position:0%
second page three
 
06:05:02.330 --> 06:05:02.340 align:start position:0%
as I was saying the plan has a planned
 
06:05:05.270 --> 06:05:05.280 align:start position:0%
document the pension system the pension
 
06:05:07.788 --> 06:05:07.798 align:start position:0%
law is the planned document that's why
 
06:05:10.070 --> 06:05:10.080 align:start position:0%
it's so detailed of how the pension
 
06:05:13.850 --> 06:05:13.860 align:start position:0%
Works 457 and this 401a would have an
 
06:05:16.970 --> 06:05:16.980 align:start position:0%
IRS approved plan document that's about
 
06:05:20.048 --> 06:05:20.058 align:start position:0%
60 pages that contains every single IRS
 
06:05:24.410 --> 06:05:24.420 align:start position:0%
law and regulation so it would be a
 
06:05:26.930 --> 06:05:26.940 align:start position:0%
it we do not need to do administrative
 
06:05:29.448 --> 06:05:29.458 align:start position:0%
rules because we have the basic
 
06:05:31.730 --> 06:05:31.740 align:start position:0%
parameters are in the Bill of who's
 
06:05:34.610 --> 06:05:34.620 align:start position:0%
eligible and what their rate will be but
 
06:05:37.430 --> 06:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
everything else will be taken care of by
 
06:05:39.948 --> 06:05:39.958 align:start position:0%
the planned document so my request would
 
06:05:42.830 --> 06:05:42.840 align:start position:0%
be that that 541a
 
06:05:47.330 --> 06:05:47.340 align:start position:0%
a requirement to do rules would be waive
 
06:05:49.490 --> 06:05:49.500 align:start position:0%
or taken out
 
06:05:49.500 --> 06:05:50.270 align:start position:0%
or taken out
um

06:05:50.270 --> 06:05:50.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:05:52.310 --> 06:05:52.320 align:start position:0%
again we've talked about the two percent
 
06:05:56.208 --> 06:05:56.218 align:start position:0%
there's uh 2.48 there are other states
 
06:05:59.030 --> 06:05:59.040 align:start position:0%
that do this Oklahoma was mentioned they
 
06:06:01.128 --> 06:06:01.138 align:start position:0%
have a hundred percent or very close to
 
06:06:03.170 --> 06:06:03.180 align:start position:0%
it pension funding so when they went
 
06:06:05.810 --> 06:06:05.820 align:start position:0%
with this and a mandatory
 
06:06:08.510 --> 06:06:08.520 align:start position:0%
um you know they they indeed do have
 
06:06:10.090 --> 06:06:10.100 align:start position:0%
this structure
 
06:06:12.590 --> 06:06:12.600 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania which is another state I
 
06:06:15.048 --> 06:06:15.058 align:start position:0%
looked at they have this plan as one of
 
06:06:16.910 --> 06:06:16.920 align:start position:0%
their many options
 
06:06:20.270 --> 06:06:20.280 align:start position:0%
uh for a new employee being hired
 
06:06:22.310 --> 06:06:22.320 align:start position:0%
um they have seven and a half percent
 
06:06:25.128 --> 06:06:25.138 align:start position:0%
for the for the employee and they have
 
06:06:27.288 --> 06:06:27.298 align:start position:0%
three and a half percent
 
06:06:29.448 --> 06:06:29.458 align:start position:0%
um by the mandatory contribution from
 
06:06:31.970 --> 06:06:31.980 align:start position:0%
the state and both of those go into the
 
06:06:35.628 --> 06:06:35.638 align:start position:0%
401a plan so there's no linkage at all
 
06:06:39.350 --> 06:06:39.360 align:start position:0%
to the 457 except they're record kept by
 
06:06:42.110 --> 06:06:42.120 align:start position:0%
the same company which saves money and
 
06:06:44.690 --> 06:06:44.700 align:start position:0%
the the employees can see those both
 
06:06:46.250 --> 06:06:46.260 align:start position:0%
plans on
 
06:06:49.430 --> 06:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
both on the one statement
 
06:06:51.170 --> 06:06:51.180 align:start position:0%
um but it doesn't count there's no
 
06:06:53.990 --> 06:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
counting against the limits on the 457.
 
06:06:56.868 --> 06:06:56.878 align:start position:0%
that can that continues to be a
 
06:07:01.368 --> 06:07:01.378 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:04.970 --> 06:07:04.980 align:start position:0%
initial funding I mean uh it it's uh
 
06:07:07.670 --> 06:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
this is very thoughtful in Pennsylvania
 
06:07:09.650 --> 06:07:09.660 align:start position:0%
my discussion with the executive
 
06:07:10.990 --> 06:07:11.000 align:start position:0%
director there
 
06:07:15.048 --> 06:07:15.058 align:start position:0%
which is in the pension system
 
06:07:16.548 --> 06:07:16.558 align:start position:0%
is that
 
06:07:19.010 --> 06:07:19.020 align:start position:0%
they guarantee they the state had to
 
06:07:20.930 --> 06:07:20.940 align:start position:0%
guarantee to The Record Keeper that they
 
06:07:23.448 --> 06:07:23.458 align:start position:0%
would do they would cover all costs of
 
06:07:25.970 --> 06:07:25.980 align:start position:0%
the record keeping and the plan for five
 
06:07:25.980 --> 06:07:27.650 align:start position:0%
the record keeping and the plan for five
years

06:07:27.650 --> 06:07:27.660 align:start position:0%
years
 
06:07:31.490 --> 06:07:31.500 align:start position:0%
and and that's why they got bids they uh
 
06:07:32.868 --> 06:07:32.878 align:start position:0%
you know the Record Keeper is going okay
 
06:07:35.690 --> 06:07:35.700 align:start position:0%
what happens after two years
 
06:07:38.868 --> 06:07:38.878 align:start position:0%
and if the plan still isn't enough
 
06:07:40.850 --> 06:07:40.860 align:start position:0%
it are we going to have to put
 
06:07:43.850 --> 06:07:43.860 align:start position:0%
prohibitively expensive
 
06:07:47.570 --> 06:07:47.580 align:start position:0%
um fees on the plan to run it
 
06:07:49.850 --> 06:07:49.860 align:start position:0%
so might I suggest this that there's
 
06:07:53.750 --> 06:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
consideration on the fees that after an
 
06:07:57.530 --> 06:07:57.540 align:start position:0%
extension of Beyond two years or
 
06:08:01.310 --> 06:08:01.320 align:start position:0%
um that it gradually state state
 
06:08:01.320 --> 06:08:02.390 align:start position:0%
um that it gradually state state
um

06:08:02.390 --> 06:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:08:05.270 --> 06:08:05.280 align:start position:0%
funding gradually decreases to like 75
 
06:08:08.510 --> 06:08:08.520 align:start position:0%
percent 50 and then 25 and so you still
 
06:08:10.788 --> 06:08:10.798 align:start position:0%
have an end date but there's a
 
06:08:12.830 --> 06:08:12.840 align:start position:0%
transition period because I do not
 
06:08:14.628 --> 06:08:14.638 align:start position:0%
believe the plan would be large enough
 
06:08:17.090 --> 06:08:17.100 align:start position:0%
to support
 
06:08:20.750 --> 06:08:20.760 align:start position:0%
um all of the costs within two years
 
06:08:25.070 --> 06:08:25.080 align:start position:0%
okay I do I think the transition uh uh
 
06:08:27.948 --> 06:08:27.958 align:start position:0%
date is doable
 
06:08:31.070 --> 06:08:31.080 align:start position:0%
um under a state we would go out to bid
 
06:08:33.590 --> 06:08:33.600 align:start position:0%
and add this on
 
06:08:33.600 --> 06:08:35.868 align:start position:0%
and add this on
um

06:08:35.868 --> 06:08:35.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:40.250 --> 06:08:40.260 align:start position:0%
we have to uh by IRS law and the cus and
 
06:08:43.850 --> 06:08:43.860 align:start position:0%
and The Prudent investment rules we
 
06:08:46.430 --> 06:08:46.440 align:start position:0%
would select just like a 401k the
 
06:08:49.490 --> 06:08:49.500 align:start position:0%
investment options uh it might not be
 
06:08:54.170 --> 06:08:54.180 align:start position:0%
identical to what's in the in the 457
 
06:08:57.230 --> 06:08:57.240 align:start position:0%
plan but very close I mean
 
06:08:59.330 --> 06:08:59.340 align:start position:0%
so some of the Investments would be the
 
06:08:59.340 --> 06:09:00.890 align:start position:0%
so some of the Investments would be the
same

06:09:00.890 --> 06:09:00.900 align:start position:0%
same
 
06:09:03.470 --> 06:09:03.480 align:start position:0%
I don't have off the top of my head what
 
06:09:07.070 --> 06:09:07.080 align:start position:0%
this type of plan would generating fees
 
06:09:11.150 --> 06:09:11.160 align:start position:0%
we have to keep those expenses separate
 
06:09:14.270 --> 06:09:14.280 align:start position:0%
um right now I mean my salary is fully
 
06:09:16.490 --> 06:09:16.500 align:start position:0%
reimbursed on a quarterly basis to the
 
06:09:16.500 --> 06:09:17.830 align:start position:0%
reimbursed on a quarterly basis to the
state

06:09:17.830 --> 06:09:17.840 align:start position:0%
state
 
06:09:21.230 --> 06:09:21.240 align:start position:0%
by assessments and money drawn down from
 
06:09:23.510 --> 06:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
the plan so we that's planned money
 
06:09:25.850 --> 06:09:25.860 align:start position:0%
belonging to 457 we have to be very
 
06:09:27.770 --> 06:09:27.780 align:start position:0%
careful not to mingle that with expenses
 
06:09:33.890 --> 06:09:33.900 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:41.390 --> 06:09:41.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:43.610 --> 06:09:43.620 align:start position:0%
you're not hearing
 
06:09:45.770 --> 06:09:45.780 align:start position:0%
you red there we go
 
06:09:47.150 --> 06:09:47.160 align:start position:0%
that's better
 
06:09:49.610 --> 06:09:49.620 align:start position:0%
I had too many on I think
 
06:09:51.470 --> 06:09:51.480 align:start position:0%
yeah it sounds like you've done a little
 
06:09:53.390 --> 06:09:53.400 align:start position:0%
bit of research on what other states
 
06:09:55.310 --> 06:09:55.320 align:start position:0%
that have similar plans
 
06:09:58.430 --> 06:09:58.440 align:start position:0%
are paying into the system and I heard
 
06:10:00.948 --> 06:10:00.958 align:start position:0%
one of your figures was 3.4 percent from
 
06:10:02.868 --> 06:10:02.878 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania or wherever
 
06:10:04.670 --> 06:10:04.680 align:start position:0%
and that seems
 
06:10:06.470 --> 06:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
like a better rate than what we're
 
06:10:09.650 --> 06:10:09.660 align:start position:0%
looking at 2.48 when you look over 30 40
 
06:10:12.410 --> 06:10:12.420 align:start position:0%
years that really accumulates into
 
06:10:14.930 --> 06:10:14.940 align:start position:0%
quite an added amount of money in
 
06:10:16.250 --> 06:10:16.260 align:start position:0%
someone's account
 
06:10:19.368 --> 06:10:19.378 align:start position:0%
and I'm just curious as to if other
 
06:10:21.470 --> 06:10:21.480 align:start position:0%
states are
 
06:10:25.070 --> 06:10:25.080 align:start position:0%
that low or where the median is among
 
06:10:26.810 --> 06:10:26.820 align:start position:0%
states that are doing this and if you
 
06:10:28.128 --> 06:10:28.138 align:start position:0%
could get some of those figures it would
 
06:10:29.810 --> 06:10:29.820 align:start position:0%
be helpful
 
06:10:32.570 --> 06:10:32.580 align:start position:0%
I I can I mean the question there is
 
06:10:36.048 --> 06:10:36.058 align:start position:0%
will 2.48 be enough
 
06:10:36.058 --> 06:10:37.430 align:start position:0%
will 2.48 be enough
because

06:10:37.430 --> 06:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
because
 
06:10:39.470 --> 06:10:39.480 align:start position:0%
what you're looking at is not the cost
 
06:10:42.350 --> 06:10:42.360 align:start position:0%
to run the pension plan which is the
 
06:10:45.590 --> 06:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
2.48 it's will that be enough to make
 
06:10:48.890 --> 06:10:48.900 align:start position:0%
sure that that employee can retire
 
06:10:51.530 --> 06:10:51.540 align:start position:0%
because the employer doesn't want people
 
06:10:53.690 --> 06:10:53.700 align:start position:0%
working at 70.
 
06:10:55.128 --> 06:10:55.138 align:start position:0%
um and and the employee doesn't
 
06:10:57.350 --> 06:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
necessarily want to work till 70. and
 
06:10:58.610 --> 06:10:58.620 align:start position:0%
many retire
 
06:11:01.730 --> 06:11:01.740 align:start position:0%
you know they can plan to work to pass
 
06:11:04.970 --> 06:11:04.980 align:start position:0%
65 but you know a lot there's a lot of
 
06:11:07.010 --> 06:11:07.020 align:start position:0%
people that exit the workforce for a
 
06:11:09.470 --> 06:11:09.480 align:start position:0%
variety of reasons earlier yes and that
 
06:11:13.070 --> 06:11:13.080 align:start position:0%
shows up in Social Security claiming
 
06:11:15.170 --> 06:11:15.180 align:start position:0%
and that's my concern Madam chair is yes
 
06:11:16.970 --> 06:11:16.980 align:start position:0%
whether or not we have enough money
 
06:11:18.530 --> 06:11:18.540 align:start position:0%
going into an account we have an account
 
06:11:21.590 --> 06:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
benefit plan at a low cost to employers
 
06:11:25.070 --> 06:11:25.080 align:start position:0%
and to give another plan that may not be
 
06:11:27.530 --> 06:11:27.540 align:start position:0%
as beneficial to the employees and
 
06:11:29.690 --> 06:11:29.700 align:start position:0%
that's why I'd like this information so
 
06:11:31.670 --> 06:11:31.680 align:start position:0%
it will be good information to have and
 
06:11:35.270 --> 06:11:35.280 align:start position:0%
uh I I don't know who I'll inquire where
 
06:11:36.948 --> 06:11:36.958 align:start position:0%
we could get this because right now we
 
06:11:39.350 --> 06:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
look at it and and our pitch for people
 
06:11:41.570 --> 06:11:41.580 align:start position:0%
to voluntarily join the plan and we have
 
06:11:44.390 --> 06:11:44.400 align:start position:0%
just just over 40 percent of all
 
06:11:46.730 --> 06:11:46.740 align:start position:0%
full-time employees contribute sending
 
06:11:48.830 --> 06:11:48.840 align:start position:0%
nearly a million dollars every paycheck
 
06:11:51.590 --> 06:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
of their own money right we'll look at
 
06:11:53.750 --> 06:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
we'll get our researcher to find out
 
06:11:57.230 --> 06:11:57.240 align:start position:0%
what other pla what other states offer
 
06:12:00.770 --> 06:12:00.780 align:start position:0%
in their plans and one comment about
 
06:12:03.048 --> 06:12:03.058 align:start position:0%
um pension costs
 
06:12:08.330 --> 06:12:08.340 align:start position:0%
um this this uh legislation talks about
 
06:12:11.030 --> 06:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
um people rolling money that they have
 
06:12:13.368 --> 06:12:13.378 align:start position:0%
in the Deferred benefit the fine Benefit
 
06:12:17.150 --> 06:12:17.160 align:start position:0%
Plan into the defined contribution plan
 
06:12:19.548 --> 06:12:19.558 align:start position:0%
like a new worker like oh I don't you
 
06:12:21.110 --> 06:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
know I've been here two years
 
06:12:24.170 --> 06:12:24.180 align:start position:0%
I mean that is possible
 
06:12:26.090 --> 06:12:26.100 align:start position:0%
um but I think that may come with a cost
 
06:12:28.788 --> 06:12:28.798 align:start position:0%
so if you left the state after three
 
06:12:31.788 --> 06:12:31.798 align:start position:0%
years you're not vested you have no
 
06:12:33.530 --> 06:12:33.540 align:start position:0%
entitlement to State money in the
 
06:12:36.890 --> 06:12:36.900 align:start position:0%
pension plan you only you can roll out
 
06:12:38.750 --> 06:12:38.760 align:start position:0%
your contributions and the interest
 
06:12:41.990 --> 06:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
that's accrued you can roll that tax
 
06:12:44.208 --> 06:12:44.218 align:start position:0%
with no tax consequences into the Divine
 
06:12:46.368 --> 06:12:46.378 align:start position:0%
contribution plan or another retirement
 
06:12:48.890 --> 06:12:48.900 align:start position:0%
vehicle so I'm assuming that that's what
 
06:12:50.628 --> 06:12:50.638 align:start position:0%
the bill is talking about
 
06:12:53.628 --> 06:12:53.638 align:start position:0%
so it actually is something I don't see
 
06:12:55.670 --> 06:12:55.680 align:start position:0%
it anywhere in the amendment but it was
 
06:12:58.730 --> 06:12:58.740 align:start position:0%
part of the intention that the I just
 
06:13:01.128 --> 06:13:01.138 align:start position:0%
think that so you would
 
06:13:02.930 --> 06:13:02.940 align:start position:0%
you would do that it would make sense
 
06:13:04.910 --> 06:13:04.920 align:start position:0%
for an individual say under five years
 
06:13:07.670 --> 06:13:07.680 align:start position:0%
but then then it would make less sense
 
06:13:09.650 --> 06:13:09.660 align:start position:0%
as you get closer and closer to a
 
06:13:12.410 --> 06:13:12.420 align:start position:0%
guaranteed benefit
 
06:13:13.970 --> 06:13:13.980 align:start position:0%
um but I think there's a there would be
 
06:13:15.890 --> 06:13:15.900 align:start position:0%
a cost associated with that even though
 
06:13:19.128 --> 06:13:19.138 align:start position:0%
the employee exits the system in their
 
06:13:21.350 --> 06:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
the quote unquote cost would stop that
 
06:13:21.360 --> 06:13:22.250 align:start position:0%
the quote unquote cost would stop that
may

06:13:22.250 --> 06:13:22.260 align:start position:0%
may
 
06:13:25.788 --> 06:13:25.798 align:start position:0%
that may interrupt but it was just a
 
06:13:35.110 --> 06:13:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:37.190 --> 06:13:37.200 align:start position:0%
excuse me representative Schmidt we've
 
06:13:38.868 --> 06:13:38.878 align:start position:0%
got you're getting some feedback
 
06:13:38.878 --> 06:13:42.610 align:start position:0%
got you're getting some feedback
somewhere

06:13:42.610 --> 06:13:42.620 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:46.190 --> 06:13:46.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:47.750 --> 06:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
goalie what are you doing with this
 
06:13:50.990 --> 06:13:51.000 align:start position:0%
system over here okay anyway so you you
 
06:13:52.788 --> 06:13:52.798 align:start position:0%
just got done saying there would be a
 
06:13:55.730 --> 06:13:55.740 align:start position:0%
something cost involved and I didn't
 
06:14:01.868 --> 06:14:01.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:04.548 --> 06:14:04.558 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I was just suggesting that
 
06:14:06.948 --> 06:14:06.958 align:start position:0%
there might be a further cost to the
 
06:14:10.730 --> 06:14:10.740 align:start position:0%
pension plan if you allowed employees
 
06:14:12.708 --> 06:14:12.718 align:start position:0%
who were like new employees say three
 
06:14:14.990 --> 06:14:15.000 align:start position:0%
years in and they go no I want to go to
 
06:14:17.150 --> 06:14:17.160 align:start position:0%
the defined contribution plan I want to
 
06:14:19.310 --> 06:14:19.320 align:start position:0%
pull my money out if you allowed that
 
06:14:21.410 --> 06:14:21.420 align:start position:0%
and I think that would take specific
 
06:14:21.420 --> 06:14:23.090 align:start position:0%
and I think that would take specific
legislation

06:14:23.090 --> 06:14:23.100 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
06:14:25.910 --> 06:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
um that they're early withdrawal with
 
06:14:28.430 --> 06:14:28.440 align:start position:0%
their money and interest might be an
 
06:14:31.490 --> 06:14:31.500 align:start position:0%
additional cost to the pension plan can
 
06:14:34.430 --> 06:14:34.440 align:start position:0%
I just Carlin is about to say that say
 
06:14:36.350 --> 06:14:36.360 align:start position:0%
something about that
 
06:14:38.690 --> 06:14:38.700 align:start position:0%
say that that's an example of the type
 
06:14:40.548 --> 06:14:40.558 align:start position:0%
of conduit we need the actor to look at
 
06:14:42.830 --> 06:14:42.840 align:start position:0%
that and alert us to what I was saying
 
06:14:45.530 --> 06:14:45.540 align:start position:0%
it's you know it looks okay but they may
 
06:14:47.390 --> 06:14:47.400 align:start position:0%
be some devils in the detail but that's
 
06:14:50.628 --> 06:14:50.638 align:start position:0%
a good example okay yes and
 
06:14:53.030 --> 06:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
and it's probably a secondary second
 
06:14:55.610 --> 06:14:55.620 align:start position:0%
level effect as opposed to the primary
 
06:14:56.930 --> 06:14:56.940 align:start position:0%
effects of
 
06:14:59.270 --> 06:14:59.280 align:start position:0%
so it's just a quick quick question this
 
06:15:01.788 --> 06:15:01.798 align:start position:0%
is going to the subcommittee why yes of
 
06:15:04.490 --> 06:15:04.500 align:start position:0%
course and uh you're absolutely correct
 
06:15:07.788 --> 06:15:07.798 align:start position:0%
but we're beating it to death today uh
 
06:15:10.010 --> 06:15:10.020 align:start position:0%
so are you going to be available for the
 
06:15:11.930 --> 06:15:11.940 align:start position:0%
subcommittee yes
 
06:15:14.628 --> 06:15:14.638 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Gould thank you
 
06:15:16.788 --> 06:15:16.798 align:start position:0%
this is just really quick
 
06:15:18.410 --> 06:15:18.420 align:start position:0%
um did I hear you say something about
 
06:15:20.810 --> 06:15:20.820 align:start position:0%
employees can choose to switch over
 
06:15:23.510 --> 06:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
would that be part of this too
 
06:15:25.670 --> 06:15:25.680 align:start position:0%
that existing employees would get to
 
06:15:27.708 --> 06:15:27.718 align:start position:0%
switch over to them there is a line in
 
06:15:29.750 --> 06:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
here that that's what I read was the
 
06:15:32.390 --> 06:15:32.400 align:start position:0%
intent that if you were
 
06:15:34.910 --> 06:15:34.920 align:start position:0%
you know a new employee already in the
 
06:15:37.310 --> 06:15:37.320 align:start position:0%
uh pension system and you go hey I want
 
06:15:38.628 --> 06:15:38.638 align:start position:0%
to take advantage of that defined
 
06:15:40.788 --> 06:15:40.798 align:start position:0%
contribution the pilot example
 
06:15:42.530 --> 06:15:42.540 align:start position:0%
representative blackis you have an
 
06:15:49.208 --> 06:15:49.218 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:51.590 --> 06:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll have to dig through it to get
 
06:15:53.150 --> 06:15:53.160 align:start position:0%
the exact line and if it's not in there
 
06:15:56.570 --> 06:15:56.580 align:start position:0%
it's OLS left it out we've been we're
 
06:15:58.010 --> 06:15:58.020 align:start position:0%
not the only people having problems with
 
06:16:00.530 --> 06:16:00.540 align:start position:0%
them the intent and what would be in
 
06:16:01.910 --> 06:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
anything we'd really want to get through
 
06:16:03.890 --> 06:16:03.900 align:start position:0%
is that
 
06:16:03.900 --> 06:16:05.510 align:start position:0%
is that
um

06:16:05.510 --> 06:16:05.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:16:09.590 --> 06:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
this is It's on page two line 30. okay
 
06:16:11.448 --> 06:16:11.458 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you madam chair for
 
06:16:14.690 --> 06:16:14.700 align:start position:0%
finding it for me um the it's I mean I
 
06:16:15.948 --> 06:16:15.958 align:start position:0%
don't know what this thing is about a
 
06:16:17.208 --> 06:16:17.218 align:start position:0%
new employee it doesn't have to be a new
 
06:16:19.850 --> 06:16:19.860 align:start position:0%
employee so any eligible employee which
 
06:16:22.128 --> 06:16:22.138 align:start position:0%
would be a state
 
06:16:22.138 --> 06:16:23.510 align:start position:0%
would be a state
um

06:16:23.510 --> 06:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:16:24.850 --> 06:16:24.860 align:start position:0%
you know
 
06:16:27.890 --> 06:16:27.900 align:start position:0%
employee under the mean of employee in
 
06:16:29.448 --> 06:16:29.458 align:start position:0%
the pension system which would not
 
06:16:30.948 --> 06:16:30.958 align:start position:0%
include teachers or any of the group two
 
06:16:30.958 --> 06:16:31.868 align:start position:0%
include teachers or any of the group two
people

06:16:31.868 --> 06:16:31.878 align:start position:0%
people
 
06:16:35.090 --> 06:16:35.100 align:start position:0%
once if this went into effect an
 
06:16:36.590 --> 06:16:36.600 align:start position:0%
existing employee no matter how long
 
06:16:39.410 --> 06:16:39.420 align:start position:0%
they'd worked there could choose
 
06:16:42.590 --> 06:16:42.600 align:start position:0%
to move over to the defined contribution
 
06:16:44.868 --> 06:16:44.878 align:start position:0%
plan now if they've been in for a long
 
06:16:47.690 --> 06:16:47.700 align:start position:0%
time it may not make Financial sense but
 
06:16:50.330 --> 06:16:50.340 align:start position:0%
um they could do it
 
06:16:57.770 --> 06:16:57.780 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:01.910 --> 06:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
if that's the case what would the impact
 
06:17:04.788 --> 06:17:04.798 align:start position:0%
be on the existing system if a large
 
06:17:07.490 --> 06:17:07.500 align:start position:0%
portion of the employees
 
06:17:09.830 --> 06:17:09.840 align:start position:0%
existing employees decided to make the
 
06:17:13.610 --> 06:17:13.620 align:start position:0%
switch uh Mr Carlin said that let me
 
06:17:16.190 --> 06:17:16.200 align:start position:0%
Mr Carlin said that you know they'd have
 
06:17:18.708 --> 06:17:18.718 align:start position:0%
to have the actuaries look at it all I
 
06:17:21.530 --> 06:17:21.540 align:start position:0%
can say is that at least this for this
 
06:17:25.128 --> 06:17:25.138 align:start position:0%
initial take it's just state employees
 
06:17:28.910 --> 06:17:28.920 align:start position:0%
who are not teachers or group two none
 
06:17:31.430 --> 06:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
of the municipalities so
 
06:17:32.990 --> 06:17:33.000 align:start position:0%
they'll have to look into it but the
 
06:17:42.048 --> 06:17:42.058 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:47.770 --> 06:17:47.780 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:50.030 --> 06:17:50.040 align:start position:0%
I'll see we'll all see you in the
 
06:18:09.708 --> 06:18:09.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:11.030 --> 06:18:11.040 align:start position:0%
Madam chair members of the committee
 
06:18:12.110 --> 06:18:12.120 align:start position:0%
thanks the opportunity to speak here
 
06:18:13.430 --> 06:18:13.440 align:start position:0%
today for the record my name is Greg
 
06:18:15.230 --> 06:18:15.240 align:start position:0%
Moore and I am the state director for
 
06:18:16.788 --> 06:18:16.798 align:start position:0%
Americans for Prosperity in New
 
06:18:18.948 --> 06:18:18.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I'm here today testifying
 
06:18:21.530 --> 06:18:21.540 align:start position:0%
and support of House Bill 559
 
06:18:22.788 --> 06:18:22.798 align:start position:0%
but I'd like to offer a different
 
06:18:24.830 --> 06:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
perspective I could certainly repeat
 
06:18:26.628 --> 06:18:26.638 align:start position:0%
what others have heard and I know how
 
06:18:28.430 --> 06:18:28.440 align:start position:0%
much legislators love redundant
 
06:18:31.310 --> 06:18:31.320 align:start position:0%
testimony so I'll skip that uh and just
 
06:18:33.590 --> 06:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
focus on coming at it from someone who
 
06:18:35.930 --> 06:18:35.940 align:start position:0%
worked at a state agency for four years
 
06:18:37.070 --> 06:18:37.080 align:start position:0%
and then worked for the New Hampshire
 
06:18:37.080 --> 06:18:38.470 align:start position:0%
and then worked for the New Hampshire
house

06:18:38.470 --> 06:18:38.480 align:start position:0%
house
 
06:18:41.868 --> 06:18:41.878 align:start position:0%
things crackling a little bit but move
 
06:18:46.070 --> 06:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:50.090 --> 06:18:50.100 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:54.890 --> 06:18:54.900 align:start position:0%
okay is that better thanks uh I'll just
 
06:18:56.570 --> 06:18:56.580 align:start position:0%
give you a great example when I was
 
06:18:58.070 --> 06:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
working at Health and Human Services I
 
06:19:00.650 --> 06:19:00.660 align:start position:0%
was working with an employee who had
 
06:19:02.628 --> 06:19:02.638 align:start position:0%
been there for a little over eight years
 
06:19:06.170 --> 06:19:06.180 align:start position:0%
and I went to meet him at his cubicle
 
06:19:08.570 --> 06:19:08.580 align:start position:0%
and on his screensaver it had a
 
06:19:10.670 --> 06:19:10.680 align:start position:0%
countdown clock which had one year and
 
06:19:12.650 --> 06:19:12.660 align:start position:0%
about eight months of course I didn't
 
06:19:14.030 --> 06:19:14.040 align:start position:0%
recognize intuitively what it was so I
 
06:19:15.410 --> 06:19:15.420 align:start position:0%
asked him what's this he said he said
 
06:19:16.850 --> 06:19:16.860 align:start position:0%
that's when I hit my 10-year anniversary
 
06:19:18.350 --> 06:19:18.360 align:start position:0%
and I can leave
 
06:19:20.510 --> 06:19:20.520 align:start position:0%
so so just think from from the
 
06:19:23.270 --> 06:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
perspective of of an employee who has
 
06:19:24.830 --> 06:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
taken this job and it's particularly
 
06:19:28.128 --> 06:19:28.138 align:start position:0%
true now uh I think we heard seven seven
 
06:19:29.628 --> 06:19:29.638 align:start position:0%
or eight years ago there was a study
 
06:19:30.948 --> 06:19:30.958 align:start position:0%
that showed that Millennials changed
 
06:19:33.288 --> 06:19:33.298 align:start position:0%
jobs on average once every 18 months now
 
06:19:35.208 --> 06:19:35.218 align:start position:0%
I followed up on that that's that's
 
06:19:36.890 --> 06:19:36.900 align:start position:0%
grown so the good news is Millennials
 
06:19:38.810 --> 06:19:38.820 align:start position:0%
are staying in their jobs longer the bad
 
06:19:40.548 --> 06:19:40.558 align:start position:0%
news is that the Gen ziers who are the
 
06:19:42.770 --> 06:19:42.780 align:start position:0%
now college graduates have been even
 
06:19:44.330 --> 06:19:44.340 align:start position:0%
shorter Runway that's typically around
 
06:19:47.448 --> 06:19:47.458 align:start position:0%
16 to 17 months so it seems like people
 
06:19:49.250 --> 06:19:49.260 align:start position:0%
are staying in jobs longer and longer
 
06:19:51.288 --> 06:19:51.298 align:start position:0%
and the idea of a defined benefit
 
06:19:53.208 --> 06:19:53.218 align:start position:0%
contribution is great for the employer
 
06:19:54.650 --> 06:19:54.660 align:start position:0%
in the sense that it creates a strong
 
06:19:58.128 --> 06:19:58.138 align:start position:0%
incentive for employees to stay it's a
 
06:20:00.350 --> 06:20:00.360 align:start position:0%
great retention tool however right now
 
06:20:03.350 --> 06:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
having a defined defined benefit program
 
06:20:06.250 --> 06:20:06.260 align:start position:0%
is a is a recruitment
 
06:20:08.990 --> 06:20:09.000 align:start position:0%
detriment so what was it what was a
 
06:20:11.270 --> 06:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
great retention tool is now a recruit
 
06:20:13.250 --> 06:20:13.260 align:start position:0%
recruitment detriment and I think we see
 
06:20:15.590 --> 06:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
that from the numbers that uh that
 
06:20:17.270 --> 06:20:17.280 align:start position:0%
representative the sponsor I can't say
 
06:20:18.708 --> 06:20:18.718 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire here it's the
 
06:20:21.650 --> 06:20:21.660 align:start position:0%
sponsor put forward in showing just the
 
06:20:23.990 --> 06:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
absolute number of employees who don't
 
06:20:27.288 --> 06:20:27.298 align:start position:0%
make it to vesting and when you when you
 
06:20:29.948 --> 06:20:29.958 align:start position:0%
have a situation where you have probably
 
06:20:32.570 --> 06:20:32.580 align:start position:0%
I don't know maybe three quarters of
 
06:20:35.208 --> 06:20:35.218 align:start position:0%
your people not making it to vesting I
 
06:20:36.770 --> 06:20:36.780 align:start position:0%
think that's a sign that your overall
 
06:20:39.410 --> 06:20:39.420 align:start position:0%
retirement strategy isn't working
 
06:20:41.090 --> 06:20:41.100 align:start position:0%
and I think that that would be good if
 
06:20:43.430 --> 06:20:43.440 align:start position:0%
we if if we could sort of get that broke
 
06:20:46.250 --> 06:20:46.260 align:start position:0%
those numbers broken down by by state
 
06:20:48.530 --> 06:20:48.540 align:start position:0%
and by by Municipal and County Employees
 
06:20:50.510 --> 06:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
so that we could see specifically at the
 
06:20:51.410 --> 06:20:51.420 align:start position:0%
state level
 
06:20:53.390 --> 06:20:53.400 align:start position:0%
what what number of people who are of
 
06:20:55.730 --> 06:20:55.740 align:start position:0%
new hires are actually making it to
 
06:20:57.770 --> 06:20:57.780 align:start position:0%
having a vested retirement system and I
 
06:20:58.788 --> 06:20:58.798 align:start position:0%
think that's probably the greatest
 
06:21:00.590 --> 06:21:00.600 align:start position:0%
indication of whether the system is
 
06:21:02.448 --> 06:21:02.458 align:start position:0%
working or not is if you have a very
 
06:21:03.770 --> 06:21:03.780 align:start position:0%
small number of people are actually
 
06:21:06.230 --> 06:21:06.240 align:start position:0%
making it to getting their vested uh
 
06:21:07.910 --> 06:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
vested dollars by the way I did not
 
06:21:09.350 --> 06:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
invest I did not serve 10 years of
 
06:21:11.690 --> 06:21:11.700 align:start position:0%
unbroken service with the state but but
 
06:21:14.510 --> 06:21:14.520 align:start position:0%
uh but I will say I will I will say that
 
06:21:16.970 --> 06:21:16.980 align:start position:0%
that having a functional retirement
 
06:21:20.090 --> 06:21:20.100 align:start position:0%
system is a critical role in terms of a
 
06:21:22.670 --> 06:21:22.680 align:start position:0%
strong recruitment strategy
 
06:21:24.410 --> 06:21:24.420 align:start position:0%
people entering the workforce now are
 
06:21:26.090 --> 06:21:26.100 align:start position:0%
just much savvier about these things
 
06:21:28.670 --> 06:21:28.680 align:start position:0%
than perhaps I was when I started my
 
06:21:30.410 --> 06:21:30.420 align:start position:0%
career and I know a number of a number
 
06:21:32.448 --> 06:21:32.458 align:start position:0%
of people my contemporaries we just
 
06:21:34.070 --> 06:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
weren't as Savvy about these sort of
 
06:21:34.080 --> 06:21:34.850 align:start position:0%
weren't as Savvy about these sort of
things

06:21:34.850 --> 06:21:34.860 align:start position:0%
things
 
06:21:36.650 --> 06:21:36.660 align:start position:0%
probably because almost everybody was on
 
06:21:38.150 --> 06:21:38.160 align:start position:0%
a defined benefit program so people
 
06:21:39.590 --> 06:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
weren't thinking about the Alternatives
 
06:21:42.110 --> 06:21:42.120 align:start position:0%
but now with the prevalence of 401K
 
06:21:44.208 --> 06:21:44.218 align:start position:0%
plans new employees are looking at that
 
06:21:46.548 --> 06:21:46.558 align:start position:0%
and when I talk to Commissioners when I
 
06:21:48.410 --> 06:21:48.420 align:start position:0%
talk to Commissioners across I'm friends
 
06:21:49.670 --> 06:21:49.680 align:start position:0%
with a number of the state Commissioners
 
06:21:50.990 --> 06:21:51.000 align:start position:0%
they'll tell you that the number one
 
06:21:52.788 --> 06:21:52.798 align:start position:0%
problem is finding good people
 
06:21:54.410 --> 06:21:54.420 align:start position:0%
but if you cross the board you talk to
 
06:21:56.030 --> 06:21:56.040 align:start position:0%
State Commissioners finding good people
 
06:21:57.708 --> 06:21:57.718 align:start position:0%
and the second thing the brain drains so
 
06:21:59.930 --> 06:21:59.940 align:start position:0%
the their senior employees who have all
 
06:22:01.850 --> 06:22:01.860 align:start position:0%
the knowledge and skill are leaving and
 
06:22:03.890 --> 06:22:03.900 align:start position:0%
they're not bringing in that new group
 
06:22:05.750 --> 06:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
of employees or who need to come in and
 
06:22:07.490 --> 06:22:07.500 align:start position:0%
fill and grow that void and the
 
06:22:10.490 --> 06:22:10.500 align:start position:0%
consequence of that is that is that
 
06:22:12.948 --> 06:22:12.958 align:start position:0%
state agencies are farming more work out
 
06:22:15.470 --> 06:22:15.480 align:start position:0%
to Consultants as opposed to in-house
 
06:22:17.868 --> 06:22:17.878 align:start position:0%
into work and I think that having a
 
06:22:20.690 --> 06:22:20.700 align:start position:0%
retirement system that benefits uh new
 
06:22:23.030 --> 06:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
employees and is focused on on helping
 
06:22:24.890 --> 06:22:24.900 align:start position:0%
the state's recruiting strategy I think
 
06:22:26.990 --> 06:22:27.000 align:start position:0%
has other benefits that will be that
 
06:22:28.730 --> 06:22:28.740 align:start position:0%
will go down the line across state
 
06:22:31.368 --> 06:22:31.378 align:start position:0%
government so that was my point I don't
 
06:22:33.650 --> 06:22:33.660 align:start position:0%
I I support a lot of the earlier
 
06:22:34.730 --> 06:22:34.740 align:start position:0%
testimony but I don't want to be
 
06:22:36.410 --> 06:22:36.420 align:start position:0%
redundant so I'll just stick with that
 
06:22:39.048 --> 06:22:39.058 align:start position:0%
and one last point I'll make that uh
 
06:22:43.010 --> 06:22:43.020 align:start position:0%
that I think we uh people are investing
 
06:22:44.330 --> 06:22:44.340 align:start position:0%
some effort into looking at the
 
06:22:46.368 --> 06:22:46.378 align:start position:0%
long-term aspect of the state's unfunded
 
06:22:49.250 --> 06:22:49.260 align:start position:0%
liability I know that the legislation to
 
06:22:51.230 --> 06:22:51.240 align:start position:0%
to legalize cannabis which was voted out
 
06:22:53.208 --> 06:22:53.218 align:start position:0%
of committee today I believe 70 percent
 
06:22:55.368 --> 06:22:55.378 align:start position:0%
of the revenues from that from from
 
06:22:57.590 --> 06:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
those those funds go to the state's
 
06:22:59.390 --> 06:22:59.400 align:start position:0%
retirement system so I I think it's
 
06:23:00.650 --> 06:23:00.660 align:start position:0%
important to understand that that there
 
06:23:03.350 --> 06:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
are people who are actively considering
 
06:23:04.850 --> 06:23:04.860 align:start position:0%
and trying to figure out and work
 
06:23:06.530 --> 06:23:06.540 align:start position:0%
through this unfunded liability so I'd
 
06:23:11.930 --> 06:23:11.940 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:13.730 --> 06:23:13.740 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
06:23:15.530 --> 06:23:15.540 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
06:23:17.510 --> 06:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
well we have and I think we heard it in
 
06:23:19.190 --> 06:23:19.200 align:start position:0%
the governor's address too an issue of
 
06:23:21.708 --> 06:23:21.718 align:start position:0%
filling jobs
 
06:23:21.718 --> 06:23:22.730 align:start position:0%
filling jobs
um

06:23:22.730 --> 06:23:22.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:23:25.010 --> 06:23:25.020 align:start position:0%
would you not agree one of the bigger
 
06:23:26.510 --> 06:23:26.520 align:start position:0%
issues is
 
06:23:29.390 --> 06:23:29.400 align:start position:0%
state pay versus benefits and I think
 
06:23:30.530 --> 06:23:30.540 align:start position:0%
that was addressed also in the
 
06:23:32.270 --> 06:23:32.280 align:start position:0%
governor's speech increasing pay by 10
 
06:23:32.280 --> 06:23:34.010 align:start position:0%
governor's speech increasing pay by 10
percent

06:23:34.010 --> 06:23:34.020 align:start position:0%
percent
 
06:23:35.990 --> 06:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
I would say I would say that it's a lot
 
06:23:39.590 --> 06:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
of things new employees some people look
 
06:23:40.910 --> 06:23:40.920 align:start position:0%
for great benefits I mean as someone
 
06:23:43.610 --> 06:23:43.620 align:start position:0%
who's hired people and you go talking to
 
06:23:44.810 --> 06:23:44.820 align:start position:0%
them about you know what they are
 
06:23:46.128 --> 06:23:46.138 align:start position:0%
looking for as far as a compensation
 
06:23:48.110 --> 06:23:48.120 align:start position:0%
package it's all over the map some
 
06:23:49.368 --> 06:23:49.378 align:start position:0%
people are really looking towards what's
 
06:23:51.910 --> 06:23:51.920 align:start position:0%
your 401k match do you have a 401k match
 
06:23:55.190 --> 06:23:55.200 align:start position:0%
and uh and and I'll tell you that that
 
06:23:57.110 --> 06:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
pay is definitely one of them there are
 
06:23:58.548 --> 06:23:58.558 align:start position:0%
some people are motivated that's that's
 
06:24:00.708 --> 06:24:00.718 align:start position:0%
the number one factor others are focused
 
06:24:02.208 --> 06:24:02.218 align:start position:0%
more on benefits but I think that we
 
06:24:03.530 --> 06:24:03.540 align:start position:0%
have to look at the totality of the
 
06:24:05.270 --> 06:24:05.280 align:start position:0%
package that we're offering that's going
 
06:24:06.708 --> 06:24:06.718 align:start position:0%
to have the impact on the overall
 
06:24:12.048 --> 06:24:12.058 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:13.548 --> 06:24:13.558 align:start position:0%
thank you and just one more question
 
06:24:16.128 --> 06:24:16.138 align:start position:0%
seeing you brought up the pay match in
 
06:24:16.138 --> 06:24:18.230 align:start position:0%
seeing you brought up the pay match in
401k

06:24:18.230 --> 06:24:18.240 align:start position:0%
401k
 
06:24:20.628 --> 06:24:20.638 align:start position:0%
do you know what the average pay match
 
06:24:22.670 --> 06:24:22.680 align:start position:0%
is for corporations out there is it
 
06:24:25.610 --> 06:24:25.620 align:start position:0%
anywhere near 2.48 percent
 
06:24:50.890 --> 06:24:50.900 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:53.030 --> 06:24:53.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair members of the
 
06:24:55.190 --> 06:24:55.200 align:start position:0%
committee I am Drew Klein I'm president
 
06:24:57.170 --> 06:24:57.180 align:start position:0%
of the Josiah Bartlett Center for Public
 
06:24:59.510 --> 06:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
Policy New Hampshire's free market Think
 
06:25:01.910 --> 06:25:01.920 align:start position:0%
Tank I want to try to avoid a lot of the
 
06:25:03.350 --> 06:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
duplication here but make some of the
 
06:25:04.850 --> 06:25:04.860 align:start position:0%
points that we've
 
06:25:06.650 --> 06:25:06.660 align:start position:0%
um come across when looking at this
 
06:25:08.570 --> 06:25:08.580 align:start position:0%
issue so Governor sununu as
 
06:25:12.110 --> 06:25:12.120 align:start position:0%
representative goalie stated has made a
 
06:25:14.150 --> 06:25:14.160 align:start position:0%
an attempt in the budget to invest in
 
06:25:16.128 --> 06:25:16.138 align:start position:0%
the future Workforce of New Hampshire by
 
06:25:17.690 --> 06:25:17.700 align:start position:0%
increasing pay across the board by 10
 
06:25:17.700 --> 06:25:18.530 align:start position:0%
increasing pay across the board by 10
percent

06:25:18.530 --> 06:25:18.540 align:start position:0%
percent
 
06:25:21.590 --> 06:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
raising wages as I think we all agree
 
06:25:23.448 --> 06:25:23.458 align:start position:0%
we'll likely have a positive effect on
 
06:25:26.270 --> 06:25:26.280 align:start position:0%
recruitment putting new hires into a
 
06:25:28.070 --> 06:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
Divine contribution retirement plan
 
06:25:29.868 --> 06:25:29.878 align:start position:0%
would have a similar effect
 
06:25:32.030 --> 06:25:32.040 align:start position:0%
the state's outdated underfunded pension
 
06:25:33.708 --> 06:25:33.718 align:start position:0%
plan is really not an attraction to
 
06:25:35.510 --> 06:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
younger people who tend to Value
 
06:25:37.670 --> 06:25:37.680 align:start position:0%
portability more than having a
 
06:25:39.830 --> 06:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
guaranteed defined benefit and we know
 
06:25:41.990 --> 06:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
this from polling and research done on
 
06:25:44.090 --> 06:25:44.100 align:start position:0%
younger workers
 
06:25:46.610 --> 06:25:46.620 align:start position:0%
now it's been said in here and
 
06:25:46.620 --> 06:25:48.048 align:start position:0%
now it's been said in here and
representative

06:25:48.048 --> 06:25:48.058 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:25:51.708 --> 06:25:51.718 align:start position:0%
um well sponsor Maguire mentioned it
 
06:25:53.390 --> 06:25:53.400 align:start position:0%
there was a Bureau of Labor Statistics
 
06:25:55.970 --> 06:25:55.980 align:start position:0%
study showing that people changed their
 
06:25:55.980 --> 06:25:56.930 align:start position:0%
study showing that people changed their
jobs

06:25:56.930 --> 06:25:56.940 align:start position:0%
jobs
 
06:25:58.850 --> 06:25:58.860 align:start position:0%
um 12 times throughout their career that
 
06:26:02.270 --> 06:26:02.280 align:start position:0%
was a study of baby boomers
 
06:26:04.010 --> 06:26:04.020 align:start position:0%
we know that that is shrinking and
 
06:26:05.690 --> 06:26:05.700 align:start position:0%
shrinking we've gone from about changing
 
06:26:08.208 --> 06:26:08.218 align:start position:0%
your job about every three and a third
 
06:26:11.930 --> 06:26:11.940 align:start position:0%
years to 2.7 years and now we're going
 
06:26:13.548 --> 06:26:13.558 align:start position:0%
down and down down to less than two
 
06:26:17.090 --> 06:26:17.100 align:start position:0%
years younger workers particularly gen Z
 
06:26:20.090 --> 06:26:20.100 align:start position:0%
have no intention whatsoever and staying
 
06:26:22.850 --> 06:26:22.860 align:start position:0%
at a job for 10 years most of them
 
06:26:25.730 --> 06:26:25.740 align:start position:0%
what about public employees well we have
 
06:26:27.770 --> 06:26:27.780 align:start position:0%
some research on that as well Pew
 
06:26:30.288 --> 06:26:30.298 align:start position:0%
research surveyed public employees in
 
06:26:30.298 --> 06:26:31.610 align:start position:0%
research surveyed public employees in
2016.

06:26:31.610 --> 06:26:31.620 align:start position:0%
2016.
 
06:26:33.890 --> 06:26:33.900 align:start position:0%
and ask them these very questions they
 
06:26:36.410 --> 06:26:36.420 align:start position:0%
found that 60 percent of employees under
 
06:26:38.690 --> 06:26:38.700 align:start position:0%
the age of 30 did not expect to say with
 
06:26:40.250 --> 06:26:40.260 align:start position:0%
stay with their current employer until
 
06:26:40.260 --> 06:26:42.350 align:start position:0%
stay with their current employer until
retirement

06:26:42.350 --> 06:26:42.360 align:start position:0%
retirement
 
06:26:44.390 --> 06:26:44.400 align:start position:0%
so it's not surprising then
 
06:26:46.670 --> 06:26:46.680 align:start position:0%
that those employers those employees
 
06:26:50.270 --> 06:26:50.280 align:start position:0%
under age 30 told Pew their top priority
 
06:26:52.490 --> 06:26:52.500 align:start position:0%
for their retirement plans is the
 
06:26:54.470 --> 06:26:54.480 align:start position:0%
ability to take their savings with them
 
06:26:59.150 --> 06:26:59.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:02.330 --> 06:27:02.340 align:start position:0%
HP 559 would offer this flexibility
 
06:27:04.128 --> 06:27:04.138 align:start position:0%
by enrolling new employees into the
 
06:27:06.170 --> 06:27:06.180 align:start position:0%
defined contribution plan
 
06:27:08.090 --> 06:27:08.100 align:start position:0%
the University of system of New
 
06:27:09.830 --> 06:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire already has a defined
 
06:27:11.750 --> 06:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
contribution plan for its employees so
 
06:27:13.190 --> 06:27:13.200 align:start position:0%
there's no reason to fear offering one
 
06:27:14.750 --> 06:27:14.760 align:start position:0%
for new state employees
 
06:27:17.090 --> 06:27:17.100 align:start position:0%
UNH system schools actually advertise
 
06:27:19.610 --> 06:27:19.620 align:start position:0%
and boast about their defined
 
06:27:21.470 --> 06:27:21.480 align:start position:0%
contribution report retirement plan go
 
06:27:24.110 --> 06:27:24.120 align:start position:0%
to Keene State's website for example and
 
06:27:26.570 --> 06:27:26.580 align:start position:0%
right there under benefits says Keene
 
06:27:29.390 --> 06:27:29.400 align:start position:0%
State offers quote generous defined
 
06:27:32.810 --> 06:27:32.820 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:34.788 --> 06:27:34.798 align:start position:0%
defined contribution plans are in fact a
 
06:27:37.730 --> 06:27:37.740 align:start position:0%
default plan in higher education now as
 
06:27:39.230 --> 06:27:39.240 align:start position:0%
well as the private sector
 
06:27:41.230 --> 06:27:41.240 align:start position:0%
they're growing in the public sector too
 
06:27:44.288 --> 06:27:44.298 align:start position:0%
46 States plus the District of Columbia
 
06:27:46.788 --> 06:27:46.798 align:start position:0%
offer a defined contribution plan for
 
06:27:48.410 --> 06:27:48.420 align:start position:0%
employees either as the primary
 
06:27:51.230 --> 06:27:51.240 align:start position:0%
retirement plan or a supplemental plan
 
06:27:54.830 --> 06:27:54.840 align:start position:0%
19 States offer a defined contribution
 
06:27:58.190 --> 06:27:58.200 align:start position:0%
plan as their primary retirement plan
 
06:28:00.110 --> 06:28:00.120 align:start position:0%
and though these are not all Southern
 
06:28:02.448 --> 06:28:02.458 align:start position:0%
States western states there's they
 
06:28:05.410 --> 06:28:05.420 align:start position:0%
include you know Ohio Connecticut
 
06:28:09.350 --> 06:28:09.360 align:start position:0%
Michigan Pennsylvania Rhode Island
 
06:28:11.510 --> 06:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
and some people you might hear will
 
06:28:13.970 --> 06:28:13.980 align:start position:0%
blame defined contribution plans for a
 
06:28:15.948 --> 06:28:15.958 align:start position:0%
decline in America's retirement savings
 
06:28:18.948 --> 06:28:18.958 align:start position:0%
but a 2015 study by the center for
 
06:28:21.230 --> 06:28:21.240 align:start position:0%
Retirement Research at Boston College
 
06:28:23.270 --> 06:28:23.280 align:start position:0%
concluded that quote people are not
 
06:28:25.368 --> 06:28:25.378 align:start position:0%
accumulating less as a result of the
 
06:28:27.410 --> 06:28:27.420 align:start position:0%
shift from defined benefit to defined
 
06:28:29.930 --> 06:28:29.940 align:start position:0%
contribution plans
 
06:28:31.970 --> 06:28:31.980 align:start position:0%
the truth is simply that defined benefit
 
06:28:33.650 --> 06:28:33.660 align:start position:0%
plans like New Hampshire's are on the
 
06:28:35.510 --> 06:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
way out for good reason
 
06:28:37.610 --> 06:28:37.620 align:start position:0%
it's all but inevitable that these plans
 
06:28:40.010 --> 06:28:40.020 align:start position:0%
over promise and under deliver by Design
 
06:28:41.750 --> 06:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
they create incentives to promise
 
06:28:43.430 --> 06:28:43.440 align:start position:0%
unrealistically High benefits while
 
06:28:45.230 --> 06:28:45.240 align:start position:0%
shaving contributions below the level
 
06:28:47.448 --> 06:28:47.458 align:start position:0%
needed to meet those unrealistic
 
06:28:47.458 --> 06:28:48.830 align:start position:0%
needed to meet those unrealistic
expectations

06:28:48.830 --> 06:28:48.840 align:start position:0%
expectations
 
06:28:51.410 --> 06:28:51.420 align:start position:0%
and in the public sector
 
06:28:54.288 --> 06:28:54.298 align:start position:0%
Define benefits plans inevitably oblige
 
06:28:56.690 --> 06:28:56.700 align:start position:0%
taxpayers to cover any gap between the
 
06:28:58.490 --> 06:28:58.500 align:start position:0%
promise benefits and the contributions
 
06:29:01.310 --> 06:29:01.320 align:start position:0%
required to create those benefits
 
06:29:03.288 --> 06:29:03.298 align:start position:0%
enrolling new state employees in a
 
06:29:04.970 --> 06:29:04.980 align:start position:0%
defined contribution plan would be a
 
06:29:06.590 --> 06:29:06.600 align:start position:0%
better deal for the taxpayers the state
 
06:29:08.690 --> 06:29:08.700 align:start position:0%
and new employees
 
06:29:10.368 --> 06:29:10.378 align:start position:0%
employees would finally be able to
 
06:29:12.048 --> 06:29:12.058 align:start position:0%
accumulate retirement savings that they
 
06:29:15.470 --> 06:29:15.480 align:start position:0%
own and control from Year One
 
06:29:17.628 --> 06:29:17.638 align:start position:0%
which is a hugely valuable benefit that
 
06:29:20.750 --> 06:29:20.760 align:start position:0%
younger employees want but cannot get in
 
06:29:22.430 --> 06:29:22.440 align:start position:0%
the current system
 
06:29:24.110 --> 06:29:24.120 align:start position:0%
this would help attract younger people
 
06:29:26.208 --> 06:29:26.218 align:start position:0%
to the state to state government
 
06:29:28.490 --> 06:29:28.500 align:start position:0%
would set realistic expectations for new
 
06:29:30.170 --> 06:29:30.180 align:start position:0%
employees going forward and protect
 
06:29:30.180 --> 06:29:31.788 align:start position:0%
employees going forward and protect
taxpayers

06:29:31.788 --> 06:29:31.798 align:start position:0%
taxpayers
 
06:29:34.490 --> 06:29:34.500 align:start position:0%
and some we no longer have a 21st or
 
06:29:37.128 --> 06:29:37.138 align:start position:0%
rather a 20th century Workforce
 
06:29:39.048 --> 06:29:39.058 align:start position:0%
so we shouldn't Force new hires into a
 
06:29:41.208 --> 06:29:41.218 align:start position:0%
20th century retirement plan
 
06:29:44.750 --> 06:29:44.760 align:start position:0%
and to give a little bit of context and
 
06:29:46.730 --> 06:29:46.740 align:start position:0%
rep goalies earlier question about
 
06:29:46.740 --> 06:29:48.948 align:start position:0%
rep goalies earlier question about
contributions

06:29:48.948 --> 06:29:48.958 align:start position:0%
contributions
 
06:29:48.958 --> 06:29:49.730 align:start position:0%
contributions
um

06:29:49.730 --> 06:29:49.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:29:52.850 --> 06:29:52.860 align:start position:0%
the employer contribution on these
 
06:29:54.530 --> 06:29:54.540 align:start position:0%
defined contribution plans around the
 
06:29:57.650 --> 06:29:57.660 align:start position:0%
country ranges from around three percent
 
06:30:02.208 --> 06:30:02.218 align:start position:0%
in some states to about 14 percent in
 
06:30:04.628 --> 06:30:04.638 align:start position:0%
other states so it's a big range
 
06:30:09.708 --> 06:30:09.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:16.628 --> 06:30:16.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:19.490 --> 06:30:19.500 align:start position:0%
can you tell us what the states are that
 
06:30:22.368 --> 06:30:22.378 align:start position:0%
are offering three percent and which
 
06:30:25.310 --> 06:30:25.320 align:start position:0%
ones are in 14 I I could read you from a
 
06:30:27.350 --> 06:30:27.360 align:start position:0%
report from last year I don't know that
 
06:30:29.390 --> 06:30:29.400 align:start position:0%
that would be a great use of time but
 
06:30:31.310 --> 06:30:31.320 align:start position:0%
I'm sure this is available Florida just
 
06:30:33.110 --> 06:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
to give an example Florida had a really
 
06:30:34.970 --> 06:30:34.980 align:start position:0%
low system they were contributing free
 
06:30:36.890 --> 06:30:36.900 align:start position:0%
in a third percent at the state level
 
06:30:39.708 --> 06:30:39.718 align:start position:0%
and only three percent at the employee
 
06:30:41.448 --> 06:30:41.458 align:start position:0%
level they fixed that they realize that
 
06:30:43.610 --> 06:30:43.620 align:start position:0%
was a bad mix
 
06:30:49.490 --> 06:30:49.500 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:49.500 --> 06:31:05.570 align:start position:0%

06:31:08.448 --> 06:31:08.458 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question you
 
06:31:10.670 --> 06:31:10.680 align:start position:0%
referenced the university system having
 
06:31:13.070 --> 06:31:13.080 align:start position:0%
a generous defined contribution plan do
 
06:31:15.470 --> 06:31:15.480 align:start position:0%
you know what the rates are for employee
 
06:31:17.510 --> 06:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
ease employers
 
06:31:20.448 --> 06:31:20.458 align:start position:0%
uh sorry no I don't know that off top of
 
06:31:22.910 --> 06:31:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:24.530 --> 06:31:24.540 align:start position:0%
I'm sure somebody in the room would have
 
06:31:24.540 --> 06:31:25.670 align:start position:0%
I'm sure somebody in the room would have
it

06:31:25.670 --> 06:31:25.680 align:start position:0%
it
 
06:31:27.590 --> 06:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
Madam Chef we could get that I'd like to
 
06:31:29.510 --> 06:31:29.520 align:start position:0%
see the difference
 
06:31:29.520 --> 06:32:21.548 align:start position:0%
see the difference

chairman committee members thank you for
 
06:32:25.970 --> 06:32:25.980 align:start position:0%
hearing me today my name is Ray Chadwick

06:32:37.310 --> 06:32:37.320 align:start position:0%
um I'm chairman of Granite State
 
06:32:39.948 --> 06:32:39.958 align:start position:0%
taxpayers I've sent in some formal
 
06:32:42.890 --> 06:32:42.900 align:start position:0%
written testimony earlier I'll briefly
 
06:32:46.310 --> 06:32:46.320 align:start position:0%
reprise that is the point being that in
 
06:32:48.650 --> 06:32:48.660 align:start position:0%
the private sector because of the Orissa
 
06:32:50.510 --> 06:32:50.520 align:start position:0%
and other things like that Define
 
06:32:53.448 --> 06:32:53.458 align:start position:0%
benefit plans are almost non-existent at
 
06:32:56.270 --> 06:32:56.280 align:start position:0%
this point in time so anyone who is an
 
06:32:59.030 --> 06:32:59.040 align:start position:0%
employee who has access to a defined
 
06:33:02.830 --> 06:33:02.840 align:start position:0%
contribution plan he or she is already
 
06:33:05.990 --> 06:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
accepting the risk if I will call it
 
06:33:08.208 --> 06:33:08.218 align:start position:0%
that of the marketplace markets go up
 
06:33:09.948 --> 06:33:09.958 align:start position:0%
markets go down those kinds of things
 
06:33:09.958 --> 06:33:11.750 align:start position:0%
markets go down those kinds of things
happen

06:33:11.750 --> 06:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
happen
 
06:33:13.910 --> 06:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
um that same risk applies to the funds
 
06:33:16.850 --> 06:33:16.860 align:start position:0%
in our retirement system so
 
06:33:19.788 --> 06:33:19.798 align:start position:0%
that can go up and go down over time the
 
06:33:21.830 --> 06:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
point I would raise I did raise in that
 
06:33:23.690 --> 06:33:23.700 align:start position:0%
thing is that our current system
 
06:33:26.030 --> 06:33:26.040 align:start position:0%
requires all of those private sector
 
06:33:26.040 --> 06:33:27.470 align:start position:0%
requires all of those private sector
employees

06:33:27.470 --> 06:33:27.480 align:start position:0%
employees
 
06:33:29.510 --> 06:33:29.520 align:start position:0%
to indemnify
 
06:33:32.030 --> 06:33:32.040 align:start position:0%
government employees from the market
 
06:33:34.430 --> 06:33:34.440 align:start position:0%
risk that all those other people have to
 
06:33:35.990 --> 06:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
bear already
 
06:33:36.000 --> 06:33:37.548 align:start position:0%
bear already
so

06:33:37.548 --> 06:33:37.558 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:33:40.128 --> 06:33:40.138 align:start position:0%
the cost of the system and the unfunded
 
06:33:42.288 --> 06:33:42.298 align:start position:0%
liability is the result of decisions
 
06:33:45.288 --> 06:33:45.298 align:start position:0%
made by legislators before you
 
06:33:48.830 --> 06:33:48.840 align:start position:0%
decisions on 20 years 30 years what
 
06:33:52.490 --> 06:33:52.500 align:start position:0%
assumptions on return on investment what
 
06:33:55.070 --> 06:33:55.080 align:start position:0%
decisions made on providing costs of
 
06:33:57.530 --> 06:33:57.540 align:start position:0%
living analysis adjustments or whatever
 
06:33:59.510 --> 06:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
they may be
 
06:34:03.830 --> 06:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
The Proposal here is can be properly
 
06:34:07.368 --> 06:34:07.378 align:start position:0%
viewed I think as moving that risk
 
06:34:07.378 --> 06:34:08.750 align:start position:0%
viewed I think as moving that risk
from

06:34:08.750 --> 06:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
from
 
06:34:10.970 --> 06:34:10.980 align:start position:0%
basically the state government which
 
06:34:14.090 --> 06:34:14.100 align:start position:0%
ultimately means the taxpayers to new
 
06:34:16.910 --> 06:34:16.920 align:start position:0%
employees people have testified that
 
06:34:16.920 --> 06:34:18.110 align:start position:0%
employees people have testified that
indeed

06:34:18.110 --> 06:34:18.120 align:start position:0%
indeed
 
06:34:20.270 --> 06:34:20.280 align:start position:0%
it's beneficial for new employees to
 
06:34:21.770 --> 06:34:21.780 align:start position:0%
feel that they are not
 
06:34:24.590 --> 06:34:24.600 align:start position:0%
bound to the job shackle to the job and
 
06:34:26.270 --> 06:34:26.280 align:start position:0%
position because they're waiting to be
 
06:34:29.570 --> 06:34:29.580 align:start position:0%
vested my experience I started
 
06:34:32.930 --> 06:34:32.940 align:start position:0%
employment in 1968 my employer at the
 
06:34:34.970 --> 06:34:34.980 align:start position:0%
time offered a defined benefit and a
 
06:34:37.670 --> 06:34:37.680 align:start position:0%
defined pre-tax contribution they
 
06:34:40.970 --> 06:34:40.980 align:start position:0%
matched parts of it plan and I went
 
06:34:43.810 --> 06:34:43.820 align:start position:0%
through that eventually left the company
 
06:34:46.368 --> 06:34:46.378 align:start position:0%
obviously it didn't take anything out of
 
06:34:48.530 --> 06:34:48.540 align:start position:0%
the pension plan but I could take all
 
06:34:51.708 --> 06:34:51.718 align:start position:0%
the money contributed by myself and the
 
06:34:53.090 --> 06:34:53.100 align:start position:0%
company matches
 
06:34:55.310 --> 06:34:55.320 align:start position:0%
over time I rolled that into
 
06:34:57.948 --> 06:34:57.958 align:start position:0%
contributions by other employers I
 
06:35:00.470 --> 06:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
finally actualized on the defined
 
06:35:02.990 --> 06:35:03.000 align:start position:0%
benefit plan which was to find benefit
 
06:35:04.850 --> 06:35:04.860 align:start position:0%
there was no such thing as cost of
 
06:35:07.788 --> 06:35:07.798 align:start position:0%
living or inflation adjustments
 
06:35:11.390 --> 06:35:11.400 align:start position:0%
the check I got in 2006 is the exact
 
06:35:14.270 --> 06:35:14.280 align:start position:0%
same amount I get today
 
06:35:17.690 --> 06:35:17.700 align:start position:0%
the check I get today can only buy
 
06:35:21.350 --> 06:35:21.360 align:start position:0%
67 percent of what the check in 2007
 
06:35:24.830 --> 06:35:24.840 align:start position:0%
would do meanwhile the money that went
 
06:35:27.350 --> 06:35:27.360 align:start position:0%
into my defined contribution plan which
 
06:35:29.448 --> 06:35:29.458 align:start position:0%
has been reinvested currently with the
 
06:35:31.310 --> 06:35:31.320 align:start position:0%
Trust Company
 
06:35:33.948 --> 06:35:33.958 align:start position:0%
um I've been drawing on that since the
 
06:35:36.650 --> 06:35:36.660 align:start position:0%
same time 2006 in an amount
 
06:35:39.350 --> 06:35:39.360 align:start position:0%
approximately 50 percent more
 
06:35:42.350 --> 06:35:42.360 align:start position:0%
than the defined benefit amount
 
06:35:45.650 --> 06:35:45.660 align:start position:0%
and that has not only paid me that money
 
06:35:49.010 --> 06:35:49.020 align:start position:0%
about four percent every year since but
 
06:35:51.110 --> 06:35:51.120 align:start position:0%
has accumulated 10 percent more value
 
06:35:52.670 --> 06:35:52.680 align:start position:0%
over time
 
06:35:54.530 --> 06:35:54.540 align:start position:0%
the reason I bring this up is to support
 
06:35:58.610 --> 06:35:58.620 align:start position:0%
the concept of basically the
 
06:36:01.610 --> 06:36:01.620 align:start position:0%
taking new employees giving them that
 
06:36:04.128 --> 06:36:04.138 align:start position:0%
option of potentially having well having
 
06:36:07.190 --> 06:36:07.200 align:start position:0%
portability and the ability to control
 
06:36:09.890 --> 06:36:09.900 align:start position:0%
their own money we've talked a bit about
 
06:36:12.470 --> 06:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
risk it's true that there is risk when
 
06:36:14.150 --> 06:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
you go into the market depending on when
 
06:36:16.610 --> 06:36:16.620 align:start position:0%
you get in and where you are now but
 
06:36:18.770 --> 06:36:18.780 align:start position:0%
that is the state of the economy for
 
06:36:21.350 --> 06:36:21.360 align:start position:0%
virtually all private employees in this
 
06:36:23.990 --> 06:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
state and the question here I think
 
06:36:27.110 --> 06:36:27.120 align:start position:0%
before us is whether new employees
 
06:36:30.650 --> 06:36:30.660 align:start position:0%
should start transitioning to such a
 
06:36:30.660 --> 06:36:32.030 align:start position:0%
should start transitioning to such a
situation

06:36:32.030 --> 06:36:32.040 align:start position:0%
situation
 
06:36:34.250 --> 06:36:34.260 align:start position:0%
the fact that we have a six
 
06:36:35.750 --> 06:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
approximately six billion dollar
 
06:36:38.868 --> 06:36:38.878 align:start position:0%
unfunded liability reflects all those
 
06:36:40.788 --> 06:36:40.798 align:start position:0%
decisions of the past
 
06:36:40.798 --> 06:36:42.410 align:start position:0%
decisions of the past
and

06:36:42.410 --> 06:36:42.420 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:36:44.930 --> 06:36:44.940 align:start position:0%
it has not worked well I guess is the
 
06:36:48.410 --> 06:36:48.420 align:start position:0%
way I would say it so this would unsolve
 
06:36:51.708 --> 06:36:51.718 align:start position:0%
the state from an ongoing source of
 
06:36:54.110 --> 06:36:54.120 align:start position:0%
Financial Risk
 
06:36:57.830 --> 06:36:57.840 align:start position:0%
basically absolve the taxpayers at large
 
06:37:01.368 --> 06:37:01.378 align:start position:0%
from that source of Financial Risk so we
 
06:37:04.390 --> 06:37:04.400 align:start position:0%
support the the bill in its amended form
 
06:37:07.010 --> 06:37:07.020 align:start position:0%
and I'll take any questions if you will
 
06:37:10.970 --> 06:37:10.980 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:15.288 --> 06:37:15.298 align:start position:0%
good you all want to leave too
 
06:37:18.170 --> 06:37:18.180 align:start position:0%
I agree thank you very much thank you
