00:15:33.959 --> 00:15:37.970 align:start position:0%
 
sorry

00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:37.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:40.129 --> 00:15:40.139 align:start position:0%
um those Title II grants are 27-month
 
00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:42.600 align:start position:0%
grants so right now currently we have
 
00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
Grants open for the 21-22
 
00:15:50.629 --> 00:15:50.639 align:start position:0%
and then the current grant for 22.23
 
00:15:54.889 --> 00:15:54.899 align:start position:0%
the 2122 will expire September 30th of
 
00:15:59.269 --> 00:15:59.279 align:start position:0%
23. and then we'll have the 2223 Grants
 
00:16:00.769 --> 00:16:00.779 align:start position:0%
open for another additional year those
 
00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:03.540 align:start position:0%
will expire September 30th of 24. in
 
00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
addition to this summer the 23 24 grants
 
00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:10.500 align:start position:0%
coming out so you've got three years
 
00:16:14.930 --> 00:16:14.940 align:start position:0%
worth they range from 9.5 9.6 million
 
00:16:18.590 --> 00:16:18.600 align:start position:0%
dollars um this year we allocated 9.8
 
00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
million dollars in Title II programming
 
00:16:24.889 --> 00:16:24.899 align:start position:0%
those program funds can be utilized for
 
00:16:27.050 --> 00:16:27.060 align:start position:0%
mentorship for professional development
 
00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:30.180 align:start position:0%
for any type of um
 
00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:33.300 align:start position:0%
program for new Educators or Educators
 
00:16:36.889 --> 00:16:36.899 align:start position:0%
new to a school Educators that are new
 
00:16:40.189 --> 00:16:40.199 align:start position:0%
to their position perhaps the funds can
 
00:16:43.449 --> 00:16:43.459 align:start position:0%
be utilized for all of those purposes
 
00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:46.500 align:start position:0%
and then on our website we have a link
 
00:16:49.249 --> 00:16:49.259 align:start position:0%
that shows the distribution and what the
 
00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:52.320 align:start position:0%
allocations are across all the leas for
 
00:16:54.949 --> 00:16:54.959 align:start position:0%
different for their different amounts
 
00:16:57.470 --> 00:16:57.480 align:start position:0%
for example Manchester's allocation for
 
00:17:01.249 --> 00:17:01.259 align:start position:0%
this year is 1.375 million so you'll see
 
00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:03.180 align:start position:0%
that that tends to be because it is our
 
00:17:06.590 --> 00:17:06.600 align:start position:0%
largest tends to have the most or the
 
00:17:09.110 --> 00:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
largest allocation in comparison and
 
00:17:10.610 --> 00:17:10.620 align:start position:0%
then the rest will be
 
00:17:13.429 --> 00:17:13.439 align:start position:0%
it's a formula grant so it's based on
 
00:17:15.590 --> 00:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
a formula set aside by the federal
 
00:17:18.049 --> 00:17:18.059 align:start position:0%
government in relation to census poverty
 
00:17:20.569 --> 00:17:20.579 align:start position:0%
data Title 1 students and that type of
 
00:17:24.409 --> 00:17:24.419 align:start position:0%
thing so in the FY 22 allocation 2122
 
00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
that we're in right now
 
00:17:29.930 --> 00:17:29.940 align:start position:0%
yes which has to be expires on in
 
00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:33.540 align:start position:0%
September 23 of 24. so the current grant
 
00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:36.360 align:start position:0%
for so just to give you an example for
 
00:17:40.909 --> 00:17:40.919 align:start position:0%
2020 2021 we distributed funds and the
 
00:17:44.049 --> 00:17:44.059 align:start position:0%
programs lapsed
 
00:17:48.529 --> 00:17:48.539 align:start position:0%
1.385 million so 1 million 395 000 was
 
00:17:51.950 --> 00:17:51.960 align:start position:0%
not spent collectively amongst the leas
 
00:17:55.789 --> 00:17:55.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:57.710 --> 00:17:57.720 align:start position:0%
so what's done with that money that's it
 
00:17:59.690 --> 00:17:59.700 align:start position:0%
goes back to the feds it goes back to
 
00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
what to effects goes back to the U.S
 
00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:04.620 align:start position:0%
department yes if that money is not
 
00:18:06.770 --> 00:18:06.780 align:start position:0%
spent by the program then it is returned
 
00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
so currently in for the 2122 Grant which
 
00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
is going to expire or ends the period
 
00:18:17.690 --> 00:18:17.700 align:start position:0%
performance and September 30th of 23
 
00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:20.220 align:start position:0%
there's about nine hundred thousand
 
00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:22.260 align:start position:0%
dollars that's not budgeted so what that
 
00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:24.240 align:start position:0%
means is we have allocated the funds to
 
00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:26.280 align:start position:0%
the schools they have gone in and put in
 
00:18:27.529 --> 00:18:27.539 align:start position:0%
their activities into the grants
 
00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:29.460 align:start position:0%
management system we have approved those
 
00:18:32.690 --> 00:18:32.700 align:start position:0%
grants 900 000 has not been budgeted
 
00:18:35.150 --> 00:18:35.160 align:start position:0%
they have not said we're how much what
 
00:18:36.049 --> 00:18:36.059 align:start position:0%
you know what they're going to do with
 
00:18:37.909 --> 00:18:37.919 align:start position:0%
that nine hundred thousand dollars
 
00:18:37.919 --> 00:18:39.830 align:start position:0%
that nine hundred thousand dollars
so

00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:43.260 align:start position:0%
if we look at our current balance as of
 
00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:44.169 align:start position:0%
if we look at our current balance as of
today

00:18:44.169 --> 00:18:44.179 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:18:48.169 --> 00:18:48.179 align:start position:0%
2.7 million has not been spent so we
 
00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:50.160 align:start position:0%
have 2.7 million to spend down by
 
00:18:54.169 --> 00:18:54.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:56.210 --> 00:18:56.220 align:start position:0%
is it likely you will spend it down or
 
00:18:58.070 --> 00:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
not that's on the program side so that's
 
00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:01.320 align:start position:0%
the leas if the leas spend it
 
00:19:03.529 --> 00:19:03.539 align:start position:0%
um and then we have an additional Grant
 
00:19:05.810 --> 00:19:05.820 align:start position:0%
when does that be spent by September
 
00:19:09.049 --> 00:19:09.059 align:start position:0%
30th that in this year of this year yes
 
00:19:11.029 --> 00:19:11.039 align:start position:0%
if we're getting to the end of the
 
00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:13.620 align:start position:0%
school year right now correct
 
00:19:15.169 --> 00:19:15.179 align:start position:0%
and there's I mean definitely summer
 
00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:18.840 align:start position:0%
programming but it it with 900 000 of
 
00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:22.380 align:start position:0%
that not being budgeted you know they'll
 
00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
it gets makes someone like me a little
 
00:19:26.270 --> 00:19:26.280 align:start position:0%
bit nervous because I'm like so let's
 
00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:27.480 align:start position:0%
spend this down let's spend this down
 
00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
and addition if you're looking at the
 
00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:32.340 align:start position:0%
current grant for this school year which
 
00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:33.480 align:start position:0%
will expire
 
00:19:36.169 --> 00:19:36.179 align:start position:0%
next September
 
00:19:38.029 --> 00:19:38.039 align:start position:0%
um and that was the information that I
 
00:19:41.150 --> 00:19:41.160 align:start position:0%
sent out oh wait kind of reverted sorry
 
00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:43.860 align:start position:0%
I gotta pull up my grant balance on that
 
00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:48.780 align:start position:0%
one give me just a moment to reset it
 
00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:51.360 align:start position:0%
um but I think we're at about 2.6
 
00:19:55.970 --> 00:19:55.980 align:start position:0%
budgeted and we've distributed 9.8
 
00:19:58.730 --> 00:19:58.740 align:start position:0%
so that's quite a bit they have to spend
 
00:20:01.370 --> 00:20:01.380 align:start position:0%
within a year
 
00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:03.720 align:start position:0%
representative cascadden question so
 
00:20:07.909 --> 00:20:07.919 align:start position:0%
there's no redistribution of funds no
 
00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:09.960 align:start position:0%
is there in Title One
 
00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:12.360 align:start position:0%
title one they can carry over their
 
00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:14.520 align:start position:0%
funds but it's limited so they might be
 
00:20:15.770 --> 00:20:15.780 align:start position:0%
able to carry over service percentage
 
00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
one year
 
00:20:20.029 --> 00:20:20.039 align:start position:0%
um but yes also Title One funds could be
 
00:20:22.549 --> 00:20:22.559 align:start position:0%
utilized for a similar purpose okay it's
 
00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
no carryover and choose title two no no
 
00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:27.240 align:start position:0%
there is not
 
00:20:30.409 --> 00:20:30.419 align:start position:0%
when we allocate dollars to another
 
00:20:32.090 --> 00:20:32.100 align:start position:0%
program like Career Technical education
 
00:20:33.890 --> 00:20:33.900 align:start position:0%
we have what we call a maintenance of
 
00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
effort correct and it does that is that
 
00:20:39.049 --> 00:20:39.059 align:start position:0%
applicable to this program as well not
 
00:20:40.970 --> 00:20:40.980 align:start position:0%
for title two not for title two the
 
00:20:42.770 --> 00:20:42.780 align:start position:0%
supplement versus a plant is an issue
 
00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:43.490 align:start position:0%
supplement versus a plant is an issue
though

00:20:43.490 --> 00:20:43.500 align:start position:0%
though
 
00:20:48.289 --> 00:20:48.299 align:start position:0%
so I I will be be um just clear on the
 
00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:50.760 align:start position:0%
the requirements
 
00:20:53.810 --> 00:20:53.820 align:start position:0%
if the grant so if we had the five
 
00:20:55.789 --> 00:20:55.799 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars and we are
 
00:20:58.850 --> 00:20:58.860 align:start position:0%
Distributing those funds out the less
 
00:21:01.850 --> 00:21:01.860 align:start position:0%
would have to spend down that allocation
 
00:21:04.130 --> 00:21:04.140 align:start position:0%
or that Grant before they could spend
 
00:21:09.169 --> 00:21:09.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:12.360 align:start position:0%
oh okay yeah so we've distributed for
 
00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:16.320 align:start position:0%
this year the 22-23 school year funds
 
00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
expiring September 30th of 24. we've
 
00:21:22.370 --> 00:21:22.380 align:start position:0%
distributed 9.8 or allocated 9.8 million
 
00:21:25.850 --> 00:21:25.860 align:start position:0%
so far our leas has spent down 24 of
 
00:21:29.710 --> 00:21:29.720 align:start position:0%
that which is about 1.2 million so um
 
00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:33.240 align:start position:0%
5.2 million has been budgeted so you
 
00:21:36.890 --> 00:21:36.900 align:start position:0%
figure about 54 of the funds have been
 
00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:38.510 align:start position:0%
figure about 54 of the funds have been
budgeted

00:21:38.510 --> 00:21:38.520 align:start position:0%
budgeted
 
00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:40.370 align:start position:0%
budgeted
and

00:21:40.370 --> 00:21:40.380 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:42.840 align:start position:0%
and the other 46 percent
 
00:21:45.529 --> 00:21:45.539 align:start position:0%
have not been budgeted at all
 
00:21:47.570 --> 00:21:47.580 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner
 
00:21:49.610 --> 00:21:49.620 align:start position:0%
I have a couple of questions thank you
 
00:21:52.250 --> 00:21:52.260 align:start position:0%
for taking them um because I really
 
00:21:54.049 --> 00:21:54.059 align:start position:0%
would like to find out more about this
 
00:21:56.870 --> 00:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
when you say it's not been budgeted is
 
00:21:59.630 --> 00:21:59.640 align:start position:0%
it not budgeted by the Lea or by the doe
 
00:22:02.210 --> 00:22:02.220 align:start position:0%
uh by the Lea so we have allocated the
 
00:22:04.430 --> 00:22:04.440 align:start position:0%
money we have given them the 9.8 million
 
00:22:07.730 --> 00:22:07.740 align:start position:0%
dollars they have submitted their budget
 
00:22:09.169 --> 00:22:09.179 align:start position:0%
to us saying this is what I would like
 
00:22:10.850 --> 00:22:10.860 align:start position:0%
to spend it on we review it and say okay
 
00:22:14.149 --> 00:22:14.159 align:start position:0%
it's allowable and then we approve it
 
00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:16.740 align:start position:0%
and so we're looking at only
 
00:22:19.370 --> 00:22:19.380 align:start position:0%
um you know 54 of that has been
 
00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:21.480 align:start position:0%
submitted to us we've approved it and
 
00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:25.080 align:start position:0%
it's ready to be spent down so uh is
 
00:22:27.890 --> 00:22:27.900 align:start position:0%
that like um writing a grant I mean is
 
00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:28.870 align:start position:0%
that like um writing a grant I mean is
it

00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:28.880 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:22:32.510 --> 00:22:32.520 align:start position:0%
when you say budgeted it it is funny to
 
00:22:34.370 --> 00:22:34.380 align:start position:0%
me that you know that
 
00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:37.320 align:start position:0%
working on school budgets but I know
 
00:22:40.610 --> 00:22:40.620 align:start position:0%
that when money is available usually
 
00:22:42.409 --> 00:22:42.419 align:start position:0%
there's a grant that that the local
 
00:22:44.570 --> 00:22:44.580 align:start position:0%
school writes and is that what you're
 
00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
talking about it's a little bit of a
 
00:22:48.169 --> 00:22:48.179 align:start position:0%
similar process because it's a formula
 
00:22:49.909 --> 00:22:49.919 align:start position:0%
fund they they automatically get that
 
00:22:52.130 --> 00:22:52.140 align:start position:0%
allocation so we you know for Manchester
 
00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:54.780 align:start position:0%
for instance it would be the 1.375
 
00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:56.640 align:start position:0%
million so we give them that allocation
 
00:22:58.789 --> 00:22:58.799 align:start position:0%
what they need to do is write out an
 
00:23:00.409 --> 00:23:00.419 align:start position:0%
activity that explains what they're
 
00:23:02.450 --> 00:23:02.460 align:start position:0%
spending it on and how much they're
 
00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
spending it on and they have to just
 
00:23:05.149 --> 00:23:05.159 align:start position:0%
break it down into categories with their
 
00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:06.840 align:start position:0%
budget so we'll look at that and say oh
 
00:23:09.350 --> 00:23:09.360 align:start position:0%
okay for a professional development for
 
00:23:10.909 --> 00:23:10.919 align:start position:0%
science for example for our science
 
00:23:10.919 --> 00:23:12.110 align:start position:0%
science for example for our science
teachers

00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:12.120 align:start position:0%
teachers
 
00:23:13.549 --> 00:23:13.559 align:start position:0%
um we're going to you know give them a
 
00:23:15.409 --> 00:23:15.419 align:start position:0%
stipend of this amount we're going to
 
00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:17.880 align:start position:0%
pay a trainer to come in and train so
 
00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:19.200 align:start position:0%
they give us their budget for that
 
00:23:21.049 --> 00:23:21.059 align:start position:0%
activity we review it make sure it's
 
00:23:23.090 --> 00:23:23.100 align:start position:0%
allowable within the the grant program
 
00:23:25.490 --> 00:23:25.500 align:start position:0%
and then we say okay good to go and it's
 
00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
approved and you're ready to spend your
 
00:23:29.149 --> 00:23:29.159 align:start position:0%
money right so they don't when you say
 
00:23:32.090 --> 00:23:32.100 align:start position:0%
we give them the the 1.9 you're not
 
00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:33.960 align:start position:0%
really giving them that you're writing
 
00:23:37.130 --> 00:23:37.140 align:start position:0%
it rates on a reimbursement right you've
 
00:23:40.010 --> 00:23:40.020 align:start position:0%
actually set it aside and set up uh the
 
00:23:43.370 --> 00:23:43.380 align:start position:0%
parameters uh of how they apply for it
 
00:23:47.090 --> 00:23:47.100 align:start position:0%
and then if they meet your standards
 
00:23:50.149 --> 00:23:50.159 align:start position:0%
because you're the ones that say whether
 
00:23:52.669 --> 00:23:52.679 align:start position:0%
they meet the federal standards by so
 
00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:54.720 align:start position:0%
you're really interpreting the federal
 
00:23:58.010 --> 00:23:58.020 align:start position:0%
standards for the state
 
00:24:00.649 --> 00:24:00.659 align:start position:0%
um in some respects right yeah says the
 
00:24:02.690 --> 00:24:02.700 align:start position:0%
pass-through as the pass-through entity
 
00:24:04.970 --> 00:24:04.980 align:start position:0%
our responsibility is to ensure that the
 
00:24:07.250 --> 00:24:07.260 align:start position:0%
funds that they're um what they're
 
00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
spending on matches with the
 
00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:10.320 align:start position:0%
allowability that's in federal law right
 
00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:11.390 align:start position:0%
allowability that's in federal law right
so

00:24:11.390 --> 00:24:11.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:13.440 align:start position:0%
how many
 
00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:14.149 align:start position:0%
how many
um

00:24:14.149 --> 00:24:14.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:17.149 --> 00:24:17.159 align:start position:0%
how many of these do you fund and how
 
00:24:19.850 --> 00:24:19.860 align:start position:0%
many do you refuse
 
00:24:25.690 --> 00:24:25.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:28.789 --> 00:24:28.799 align:start position:0%
the leas have a pretty good idea of what
 
00:24:30.529 --> 00:24:30.539 align:start position:0%
I mean these funds have been around for
 
00:24:32.210 --> 00:24:32.220 align:start position:0%
quite a while so they have a pretty good
 
00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
interpretation of what they're going to
 
00:24:35.810 --> 00:24:35.820 align:start position:0%
spend it on so I don't I think more of
 
00:24:38.570 --> 00:24:38.580 align:start position:0%
what we tend to look at with regards to
 
00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:40.320 align:start position:0%
allowability is like period of
 
00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
performance particularly with Title II
 
00:24:47.029 --> 00:24:47.039 align:start position:0%
they cannot try to get reimbursed for
 
00:24:48.770 --> 00:24:48.780 align:start position:0%
something that's already happened so
 
00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:50.760 align:start position:0%
they can't offer professional
 
00:24:53.270 --> 00:24:53.280 align:start position:0%
development then submit it to us for
 
00:24:55.970 --> 00:24:55.980 align:start position:0%
approval after it's happened already in
 
00:24:57.770 --> 00:24:57.780 align:start position:0%
the past that's an example when we would
 
00:24:59.350 --> 00:24:59.360 align:start position:0%
say no we can't approve that because
 
00:25:02.750 --> 00:25:02.760 align:start position:0%
Federal requirements require it to be
 
00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:05.280 align:start position:0%
submitted ahead of time approved within
 
00:25:07.870 --> 00:25:07.880 align:start position:0%
the period of performance so
 
00:25:10.130 --> 00:25:10.140 align:start position:0%
percentage-wise though how many are
 
00:25:13.370 --> 00:25:13.380 align:start position:0%
approved and how many aren't I don't
 
00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:15.360 align:start position:0%
think I could answer that I don't think
 
00:25:17.810 --> 00:25:17.820 align:start position:0%
we collect the metrics on that part of
 
00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:20.400 align:start position:0%
it but I will say I mean we do have the
 
00:25:23.450 --> 00:25:23.460 align:start position:0%
how much is submitted to us and then
 
00:25:26.210 --> 00:25:26.220 align:start position:0%
what's approved so we're able to see the
 
00:25:28.669 --> 00:25:28.679 align:start position:0%
allocation of 9.8 million
 
00:25:32.149 --> 00:25:32.159 align:start position:0%
5.2 has been budgeted and 4.9 has been
 
00:25:35.210 --> 00:25:35.220 align:start position:0%
approved so that process of going back
 
00:25:37.490 --> 00:25:37.500 align:start position:0%
and forth with the Lea to ensure that
 
00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:38.450 align:start position:0%
and forth with the Lea to ensure that
that

00:25:38.450 --> 00:25:38.460 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:25:40.909 --> 00:25:40.919 align:start position:0%
the way that perhaps they describe it
 
00:25:44.090 --> 00:25:44.100 align:start position:0%
meets the allowability that piece of it
 
00:25:47.269 --> 00:25:47.279 align:start position:0%
I mean title II is one of the easier
 
00:25:49.250 --> 00:25:49.260 align:start position:0%
um grants to interpret as far as
 
00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:52.320 align:start position:0%
allowability goes and how much does the
 
00:25:55.970 --> 00:25:55.980 align:start position:0%
when you say the grants are like 9.6
 
00:25:59.570 --> 00:25:59.580 align:start position:0%
million 9.5 million how much of that is
 
00:26:01.549 --> 00:26:01.559 align:start position:0%
given to the department as
 
00:26:04.730 --> 00:26:04.740 align:start position:0%
administrative costs so the 9.8 is the
 
00:26:07.669 --> 00:26:07.679 align:start position:0%
entire allocation to the leas the grant
 
00:26:09.049 --> 00:26:09.059 align:start position:0%
that's coming in from the federal
 
00:26:11.930 --> 00:26:11.940 align:start position:0%
government to the sea is I think I want
 
00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
to say it's about 10.6 so we might get
 
00:26:18.049 --> 00:26:18.059 align:start position:0%
in a 9.8 going out so it's just that
 
00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:20.000 align:start position:0%
that difference there's a percentage
 
00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:22.700 align:start position:0%
that were allowed
 
00:26:26.810 --> 00:26:26.820 align:start position:0%
and there's requirements about what we
 
00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
can spend it on so there's a certain
 
00:26:29.630 --> 00:26:29.640 align:start position:0%
percentage that has to go for
 
00:26:31.490 --> 00:26:31.500 align:start position:0%
professional development targeted
 
00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:32.630 align:start position:0%
professional development targeted
towards

00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:32.640 align:start position:0%
towards
 
00:26:35.090 --> 00:26:35.100 align:start position:0%
um administrators and principals there's
 
00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:37.260 align:start position:0%
a small part for administrative costs
 
00:26:39.289 --> 00:26:39.299 align:start position:0%
for us to do the grants management and
 
00:26:40.970 --> 00:26:40.980 align:start position:0%
then another percentage that we can use
 
00:26:44.570 --> 00:26:44.580 align:start position:0%
for programming and I think that last
 
00:26:46.250 --> 00:26:46.260 align:start position:0%
time somebody spoke
 
00:26:47.930 --> 00:26:47.940 align:start position:0%
um I can't remember who it was they
 
00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:50.640 align:start position:0%
talked a little bit about some of the
 
00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:52.440 align:start position:0%
um contractor work that's happening
 
00:26:55.250 --> 00:26:55.260 align:start position:0%
across the state with helping out Rural
 
00:26:57.409 --> 00:26:57.419 align:start position:0%
and small school districts with
 
00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:00.240 align:start position:0%
mentorship and so that would be an
 
00:27:01.789 --> 00:27:01.799 align:start position:0%
example of a program we would use our
 
00:27:04.669 --> 00:27:04.679 align:start position:0%
Title II funds to go and help support
 
00:27:08.169 --> 00:27:08.179 align:start position:0%
those types of so the activities
 
00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
so just you know this your last question
 
00:27:14.330 --> 00:27:14.340 align:start position:0%
this month we up about 10 so far okay
 
00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:15.850 align:start position:0%
this month we up about 10 so far okay
yeah

00:27:15.850 --> 00:27:15.860 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:27:20.870 --> 00:27:20.880 align:start position:0%
so if the doe contracts uh company to
 
00:27:22.549 --> 00:27:22.559 align:start position:0%
come in to do
 
00:27:26.409 --> 00:27:26.419 align:start position:0%
uh professional development for schools
 
00:27:28.909 --> 00:27:28.919 align:start position:0%
is that money then
 
00:27:32.330 --> 00:27:32.340 align:start position:0%
taken out of the monies that are for
 
00:27:34.730 --> 00:27:34.740 align:start position:0%
example if Manchester wanted to do their
 
00:27:36.529 --> 00:27:36.539 align:start position:0%
own professional development but you had
 
00:27:40.370 --> 00:27:40.380 align:start position:0%
contracted services for mentorship they
 
00:27:43.549 --> 00:27:43.559 align:start position:0%
submitted a grant for uh their own
 
00:27:45.310 --> 00:27:45.320 align:start position:0%
program their own local program
 
00:27:47.870 --> 00:27:47.880 align:start position:0%
outlining it and and you come back and
 
00:27:49.850 --> 00:27:49.860 align:start position:0%
you say well we have we have contracted
 
00:27:51.769 --> 00:27:51.779 align:start position:0%
this service for the if we would still
 
00:27:53.630 --> 00:27:53.640 align:start position:0%
approve their activity we would it's up
 
00:27:55.070 --> 00:27:55.080 align:start position:0%
to local control how they're spending
 
00:27:56.690 --> 00:27:56.700 align:start position:0%
that funds as long as it's within the
 
00:27:58.850 --> 00:27:58.860 align:start position:0%
allowability regardless of what type of
 
00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:00.240 align:start position:0%
programming we're doing at the state
 
00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:01.310 align:start position:0%
programming we're doing at the state
level

00:28:01.310 --> 00:28:01.320 align:start position:0%
level
 
00:28:03.529 --> 00:28:03.539 align:start position:0%
we would still approve that activity
 
00:28:07.010 --> 00:28:07.020 align:start position:0%
however if it's state funded that's
 
00:28:08.390 --> 00:28:08.400 align:start position:0%
where we have to get a little bit
 
00:28:10.430 --> 00:28:10.440 align:start position:0%
careful with the supplement versus the
 
00:28:12.649 --> 00:28:12.659 align:start position:0%
plant because if we're setting aside a
 
00:28:14.450 --> 00:28:14.460 align:start position:0%
certain amount of money
 
00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
that is specific for mentorship and we
 
00:28:21.110 --> 00:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
have an uh an Lea apply for those funds
 
00:28:22.970 --> 00:28:22.980 align:start position:0%
we would just have to ensure that they
 
00:28:25.370 --> 00:28:25.380 align:start position:0%
ex completely expended those state level
 
00:28:27.350 --> 00:28:27.360 align:start position:0%
funds before they then spent down their
 
00:28:29.090 --> 00:28:29.100 align:start position:0%
Title II funds
 
00:28:32.330 --> 00:28:32.340 align:start position:0%
okay representative woodcock
 
00:28:34.789 --> 00:28:34.799 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman good morning
 
00:28:36.890 --> 00:28:36.900 align:start position:0%
um just a couple quick ones uh and I
 
00:28:38.269 --> 00:28:38.279 align:start position:0%
wasn't here the last one so we may have
 
00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
already answered the question well the
 
00:28:41.630 --> 00:28:41.640 align:start position:0%
900 I have to representative why
 
00:28:43.850 --> 00:28:43.860 align:start position:0%
although 900 000
 
00:28:45.769 --> 00:28:45.779 align:start position:0%
um if you say is still hanging there at
 
00:28:48.169 --> 00:28:48.179 align:start position:0%
this point does doe at some point send
 
00:28:49.909 --> 00:28:49.919 align:start position:0%
out a notification we have as much left
 
00:28:52.690 --> 00:28:52.700 align:start position:0%
is there anything there multiple
 
00:28:56.149 --> 00:28:56.159 align:start position:0%
constantly throughout the year um on a
 
00:28:59.750 --> 00:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
monthly basis are uh one of our program
 
00:29:01.970 --> 00:29:01.980 align:start position:0%
managers that oversees really the the
 
00:29:04.549 --> 00:29:04.559 align:start position:0%
money side sure constant messages like
 
00:29:05.690 --> 00:29:05.700 align:start position:0%
you haven't submitted your report we
 
00:29:07.970 --> 00:29:07.980 align:start position:0%
have those leas that it's been a year
 
00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:09.360 align:start position:0%
and they still haven't submitted a
 
00:29:10.850 --> 00:29:10.860 align:start position:0%
monthly report to be reimbursed for
 
00:29:12.590 --> 00:29:12.600 align:start position:0%
their costs and so it's for constantly
 
00:29:14.890 --> 00:29:14.900 align:start position:0%
giving the nudge please please please
 
00:29:17.930 --> 00:29:17.940 align:start position:0%
submit those reports and fall to that
 
00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:19.200 align:start position:0%
part of it
 
00:29:21.409 --> 00:29:21.419 align:start position:0%
um about about how many you said this is
 
00:29:22.789 --> 00:29:22.799 align:start position:0%
a formula of Grants so it's
 
00:29:24.529 --> 00:29:24.539 align:start position:0%
automatically there how about how many
 
00:29:26.930 --> 00:29:26.940 align:start position:0%
leas don't take advantage of it
 
00:29:31.610 --> 00:29:31.620 align:start position:0%
I would say oh that's a great question
 
00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:40.149 --> 00:29:40.159 align:start position:0%
I would say they all for the most part
 
00:29:43.010 --> 00:29:43.020 align:start position:0%
submit some sort of budget with the
 
00:29:45.950 --> 00:29:45.960 align:start position:0%
exception of maybe a handful okay and
 
00:29:48.169 --> 00:29:48.179 align:start position:0%
the last question if I make you're going
 
00:29:52.930 --> 00:29:52.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:55.730 --> 00:29:55.740 align:start position:0%
yes sir yes last one
 
00:29:58.789 --> 00:29:58.799 align:start position:0%
um just a final question the the um Bill
 
00:30:03.289 --> 00:30:03.299 align:start position:0%
218 is the early educator professional
 
00:30:06.110 --> 00:30:06.120 align:start position:0%
development the title two I should be
 
00:30:08.029 --> 00:30:08.039 align:start position:0%
clear title two is all professional
 
00:30:09.950 --> 00:30:09.960 align:start position:0%
development correct okay thank you thank
 
00:30:12.169 --> 00:30:12.179 align:start position:0%
you chairman you're welcome next
 
00:30:14.269 --> 00:30:14.279 align:start position:0%
represent Belcher
 
00:30:15.830 --> 00:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:30:17.510 --> 00:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
being here for this um I just wanted to
 
00:30:20.029 --> 00:30:20.039 align:start position:0%
clarify from my understanding just
 
00:30:22.310 --> 00:30:22.320 align:start position:0%
as far as the money part is concerned so
 
00:30:23.810 --> 00:30:23.820 align:start position:0%
what this bill is actually doing is it's
 
00:30:27.590 --> 00:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
establishing a grant fund and the money
 
00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:30.720 align:start position:0%
the 500 000 yearly that doesn't come
 
00:30:32.269 --> 00:30:32.279 align:start position:0%
from the federal government that comes
 
00:30:35.269 --> 00:30:35.279 align:start position:0%
from state taxpayers but it's matching
 
00:30:39.409 --> 00:30:39.419 align:start position:0%
Title II funds is that so the way I
 
00:30:42.529 --> 00:30:42.539 align:start position:0%
interpret it is that
 
00:30:44.510 --> 00:30:44.520 align:start position:0%
you know there is part in there about
 
00:30:48.430 --> 00:30:48.440 align:start position:0%
the local match or the title to match
 
00:30:52.669 --> 00:30:52.679 align:start position:0%
the the part that I guess is not
 
00:30:55.430 --> 00:30:55.440 align:start position:0%
included is that those
 
00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:56.690 align:start position:0%
included is that those
those

00:30:56.690 --> 00:30:56.700 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:30:59.870 --> 00:30:59.880 align:start position:0%
um local funds or those State funds
 
00:31:01.730 --> 00:31:01.740 align:start position:0%
would then be required to be spent down
 
00:31:03.649 --> 00:31:03.659 align:start position:0%
before they could touch any part of
 
00:31:06.110 --> 00:31:06.120 align:start position:0%
their Title II funds I don't think when
 
00:31:08.029 --> 00:31:08.039 align:start position:0%
that this was drafted that was
 
00:31:08.039 --> 00:31:09.409 align:start position:0%
that this was drafted that was
necessarily

00:31:09.409 --> 00:31:09.419 align:start position:0%
necessarily
 
00:31:09.419 --> 00:31:10.430 align:start position:0%
necessarily
um known

00:31:10.430 --> 00:31:10.440 align:start position:0%
um known
 
00:31:12.350 --> 00:31:12.360 align:start position:0%
but that's the piece we'd have to be
 
00:31:14.930 --> 00:31:14.940 align:start position:0%
clear about is that anybody applying for
 
00:31:16.430 --> 00:31:16.440 align:start position:0%
the grant
 
00:31:17.870 --> 00:31:17.880 align:start position:0%
um if it was if it were to be
 
00:31:19.789 --> 00:31:19.799 align:start position:0%
established they would just have to know
 
00:31:22.070 --> 00:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
spend these funds down first before we
 
00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:24.240 align:start position:0%
could put in your allocation into the
 
00:31:25.909 --> 00:31:25.919 align:start position:0%
grants management system for your title
 
00:31:27.409 --> 00:31:27.419 align:start position:0%
two funds I mean they could still
 
00:31:30.649 --> 00:31:30.659 align:start position:0%
possibly budget those funds but we
 
00:31:32.750 --> 00:31:32.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to turn around and pay
 
00:31:35.029 --> 00:31:35.039 align:start position:0%
out until they completely expended any
 
00:31:38.570 --> 00:31:38.580 align:start position:0%
of the local or the state funds so if
 
00:31:41.149 --> 00:31:41.159 align:start position:0%
let's say they're using their state
 
00:31:43.730 --> 00:31:43.740 align:start position:0%
and their local funds to match that
 
00:31:46.730 --> 00:31:46.740 align:start position:0%
state Grant those would both have to be
 
00:31:48.350 --> 00:31:48.360 align:start position:0%
spent down before they could touch the
 
00:31:50.330 --> 00:31:50.340 align:start position:0%
federal funds
 
00:31:51.950 --> 00:31:51.960 align:start position:0%
thank you and just actually how that
 
00:31:53.690 --> 00:31:53.700 align:start position:0%
helps a lot just to clarify just a
 
00:31:56.450 --> 00:31:56.460 align:start position:0%
little further in in a hypothetical if
 
00:31:59.029 --> 00:31:59.039 align:start position:0%
this program according to this bill were
 
00:32:01.610 --> 00:32:01.620 align:start position:0%
in place today and we had all this
 
00:32:02.870 --> 00:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
Federal money that we're talking about
 
00:32:05.930 --> 00:32:05.940 align:start position:0%
that needs to be spent this program if
 
00:32:07.130 --> 00:32:07.140 align:start position:0%
there were money left and it would
 
00:32:09.110 --> 00:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
actually be an impediment to accessing
 
00:32:11.029 --> 00:32:11.039 align:start position:0%
those federal dollars before because
 
00:32:12.350 --> 00:32:12.360 align:start position:0%
we'd have to spend down those State
 
00:32:13.970 --> 00:32:13.980 align:start position:0%
funds first before we could touch them
 
00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:15.230 align:start position:0%
funds first before we could touch them
right

00:32:15.230 --> 00:32:15.240 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:32:19.130 --> 00:32:19.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:22.130 --> 00:32:22.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:24.649 --> 00:32:24.659 align:start position:0%
saying that it's at the local level so
 
00:32:26.269 --> 00:32:26.279 align:start position:0%
the Lea would be the one that would have
 
00:32:29.450 --> 00:32:29.460 align:start position:0%
to spend it down but I would actually
 
00:32:31.310 --> 00:32:31.320 align:start position:0%
like to double check that with the
 
00:32:32.810 --> 00:32:32.820 align:start position:0%
federal Partners to ensure that entire
 
00:32:34.669 --> 00:32:34.679 align:start position:0%
500 000 would not need to be spent down
 
00:32:37.490 --> 00:32:37.500 align:start position:0%
before we could touch the 9.8
 
00:32:38.810 --> 00:32:38.820 align:start position:0%
um but it's my understanding that it's
 
00:32:41.389 --> 00:32:41.399 align:start position:0%
at the Lea level so that they couldn't
 
00:32:43.310 --> 00:32:43.320 align:start position:0%
so I for example when we talk about
 
00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
Manchester I would actually advise them
 
00:32:47.090 --> 00:32:47.100 align:start position:0%
if I were
 
00:32:48.350 --> 00:32:48.360 align:start position:0%
um a part of their administrative
 
00:32:50.990 --> 00:32:51.000 align:start position:0%
committee or you might want to really
 
00:32:53.690 --> 00:32:53.700 align:start position:0%
think through whether it's in the best
 
00:32:56.570 --> 00:32:56.580 align:start position:0%
interest because you know 1.375 versus a
 
00:32:58.190 --> 00:32:58.200 align:start position:0%
very you know small chunk of a five
 
00:32:59.630 --> 00:32:59.640 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollar Grant across the
 
00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:01.130 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollar Grant across the
state

00:33:01.130 --> 00:33:01.140 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:33:03.409 --> 00:33:03.419 align:start position:0%
it's pretty small I mean
 
00:33:05.690 --> 00:33:05.700 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't really clarify how we
 
00:33:08.269 --> 00:33:08.279 align:start position:0%
would prioritize
 
00:33:11.690 --> 00:33:11.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:13.850 --> 00:33:13.860 align:start position:0%
represent dry did you have your hand
 
00:33:16.430 --> 00:33:16.440 align:start position:0%
I did thank you Mr chairman thank you I
 
00:33:17.930 --> 00:33:17.940 align:start position:0%
think you just answered my question was
 
00:33:21.289 --> 00:33:21.299 align:start position:0%
there isn't really a a way to disperse
 
00:33:24.950 --> 00:33:24.960 align:start position:0%
this that's written in the bill but
 
00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
clarify for me please is is this kind of
 
00:33:30.409 --> 00:33:30.419 align:start position:0%
like the cart before the horse because
 
00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
it says that this money the 500
 
00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:36.480 align:start position:0%
000 would go to match the title two
 
00:33:38.570 --> 00:33:38.580 align:start position:0%
whereas you're saying we'd have to get
 
00:33:41.870 --> 00:33:41.880 align:start position:0%
the the state Grant first instead of
 
00:33:43.730 --> 00:33:43.740 align:start position:0%
that so how would you match the title
 
00:33:45.529 --> 00:33:45.539 align:start position:0%
too correct you don't know what okay
 
00:33:46.909 --> 00:33:46.919 align:start position:0%
thank you that's just what I wanted to
 
00:33:46.919 --> 00:33:47.570 align:start position:0%
thank you that's just what I wanted to
know

00:33:47.570 --> 00:33:47.580 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:33:50.149 --> 00:33:50.159 align:start position:0%
so I I do have a follow-up to the line
 
00:33:51.950 --> 00:33:51.960 align:start position:0%
of thinking we've been looking at right
 
00:33:54.409 --> 00:33:54.419 align:start position:0%
now so we allocate through we
 
00:33:56.509 --> 00:33:56.519 align:start position:0%
appropriate the department of properties
 
00:33:58.130 --> 00:33:58.140 align:start position:0%
500 Grand
 
00:34:02.330 --> 00:34:02.340 align:start position:0%
and if that money isn't used
 
00:34:04.909 --> 00:34:04.919 align:start position:0%
according to this bill any unused funds
 
00:34:08.629 --> 00:34:08.639 align:start position:0%
shall lapse back into the general fund
 
00:34:11.869 --> 00:34:11.879 align:start position:0%
so and I to assume then that seeing the
 
00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:13.200 align:start position:0%
fact that the
 
00:34:17.270 --> 00:34:17.280 align:start position:0%
the department has 250 000 to the 500
 
00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:18.950 align:start position:0%
the department has 250 000 to the 500
left

00:34:18.950 --> 00:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
left
 
00:34:21.109 --> 00:34:21.119 align:start position:0%
and this money is specifically
 
00:34:24.109 --> 00:34:24.119 align:start position:0%
appropriate for local master plan for
 
00:34:26.750 --> 00:34:26.760 align:start position:0%
staff development and recertification
 
00:34:29.389 --> 00:34:29.399 align:start position:0%
according to the bill
 
00:34:32.510 --> 00:34:32.520 align:start position:0%
could we then spend any of our monies
 
00:34:35.450 --> 00:34:35.460 align:start position:0%
which are coming title two wise to this
 
00:34:38.109 --> 00:34:38.119 align:start position:0%
state for staff professional development
 
00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
and if we allowed that money to lapse
 
00:34:44.149 --> 00:34:44.159 align:start position:0%
back into our general fund
 
00:34:48.169 --> 00:34:48.179 align:start position:0%
following my track here not no
 
00:34:50.930 --> 00:34:50.940 align:start position:0%
okay so we have appropriate X number of
 
00:34:52.669 --> 00:34:52.679 align:start position:0%
dollars to be used for professional
 
00:34:54.950 --> 00:34:54.960 align:start position:0%
development from the state level for
 
00:34:57.950 --> 00:34:57.960 align:start position:0%
local development use of those dollars
 
00:35:01.370 --> 00:35:01.380 align:start position:0%
but if you maintain at the end of this
 
00:35:04.849 --> 00:35:04.859 align:start position:0%
year annual year or the biennium money
 
00:35:08.450 --> 00:35:08.460 align:start position:0%
left in that Grant fund are we then
 
00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:11.640 align:start position:0%
allowed to use Title One Monies
 
00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:14.640 align:start position:0%
in the local levels if we still have
 
00:35:16.250 --> 00:35:16.260 align:start position:0%
local level money available at the state
 
00:35:18.109 --> 00:35:18.119 align:start position:0%
level that's the question I'd have to
 
00:35:20.410 --> 00:35:20.420 align:start position:0%
get clarification from
 
00:35:23.210 --> 00:35:23.220 align:start position:0%
the U.S Department of Education is it
 
00:35:25.130 --> 00:35:25.140 align:start position:0%
are they considering because similar to
 
00:35:26.630 --> 00:35:26.640 align:start position:0%
what I think representative Belcher was
 
00:35:28.370 --> 00:35:28.380 align:start position:0%
saying that is it
 
00:35:30.710 --> 00:35:30.720 align:start position:0%
at the sea level or the Lea my
 
00:35:32.930 --> 00:35:32.940 align:start position:0%
understanding is at the Lea level all of
 
00:35:36.050 --> 00:35:36.060 align:start position:0%
the guidance that is put out by
 
00:35:38.990 --> 00:35:39.000 align:start position:0%
um and looking at what's written in 2cfr
 
00:35:40.730 --> 00:35:40.740 align:start position:0%
it's really at the local Education
 
00:35:42.170 --> 00:35:42.180 align:start position:0%
Agency so it's my understanding the
 
00:35:44.210 --> 00:35:44.220 align:start position:0%
supplement versus the plant would be on
 
00:35:45.589 --> 00:35:45.599 align:start position:0%
that end
 
00:35:47.990 --> 00:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
but I would want to double check just to
 
00:35:52.010 --> 00:35:52.020 align:start position:0%
be sure that it's not at the sca level
 
00:35:54.410 --> 00:35:54.420 align:start position:0%
because if it were to be we're in
 
00:35:56.270 --> 00:35:56.280 align:start position:0%
trouble yes it wouldn't be worth it I
 
00:35:58.150 --> 00:35:58.160 align:start position:0%
mean 500 000 versus
 
00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
10.9 million bucks no
 
00:36:02.990 --> 00:36:03.000 align:start position:0%
represent cascadden
 
00:36:05.150 --> 00:36:05.160 align:start position:0%
um for me knowing how the amounts of
 
00:36:08.089 --> 00:36:08.099 align:start position:0%
allocations for Title II it would seem
 
00:36:09.710 --> 00:36:09.720 align:start position:0%
to me that five hundred thousand dollars
 
00:36:11.569 --> 00:36:11.579 align:start position:0%
would be better spent in building Aid or
 
00:36:11.579 --> 00:36:13.430 align:start position:0%
would be better spent in building Aid or
inadequacy

00:36:13.430 --> 00:36:13.440 align:start position:0%
inadequacy
 
00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:16.200 align:start position:0%
so I I'm having a hard time buying it
 
00:36:18.410 --> 00:36:18.420 align:start position:0%
and and following up that 1.2 million
 
00:36:22.910 --> 00:36:22.920 align:start position:0%
dollars that's uh reimbursed
 
00:36:25.730 --> 00:36:25.740 align:start position:0%
um how often how shown does a district
 
00:36:27.950 --> 00:36:27.960 align:start position:0%
receive reimbursement once they've had
 
00:36:31.190 --> 00:36:31.200 align:start position:0%
this project approved it's completed how
 
00:36:32.810 --> 00:36:32.820 align:start position:0%
long does it take before is it done on
 
00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
their quarterly payment or so reports
 
00:36:37.910 --> 00:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
can be submitted monthly so
 
00:36:39.950 --> 00:36:39.960 align:start position:0%
um districts that are I would say vary
 
00:36:42.230 --> 00:36:42.240 align:start position:0%
on top of their payment process and and
 
00:36:43.970 --> 00:36:43.980 align:start position:0%
processing everything they submitted
 
00:36:45.410 --> 00:36:45.420 align:start position:0%
right at the end of the month they turn
 
00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
around get reimbursed within a within a
 
00:36:50.270 --> 00:36:50.280 align:start position:0%
few days to a week
 
00:36:51.710 --> 00:36:51.720 align:start position:0%
um most of them are set up for automatic
 
00:36:53.270 --> 00:36:53.280 align:start position:0%
payments so they immediately get that
 
00:36:55.310 --> 00:36:55.320 align:start position:0%
but not all districts are quick to turn
 
00:36:56.930 --> 00:36:56.940 align:start position:0%
around so it really is dependent upon
 
00:36:58.250 --> 00:36:58.260 align:start position:0%
them if they turn it around pretty
 
00:37:00.170 --> 00:37:00.180 align:start position:0%
quickly and input
 
00:37:01.730 --> 00:37:01.740 align:start position:0%
um that on a monthly basis for
 
00:37:04.069 --> 00:37:04.079 align:start position:0%
reimbursement then that they get it
 
00:37:05.930 --> 00:37:05.940 align:start position:0%
pretty quickly
 
00:37:07.609 --> 00:37:07.619 align:start position:0%
but they do have to wait until they've
 
00:37:09.950 --> 00:37:09.960 align:start position:0%
paid for the service they can't they
 
00:37:12.050 --> 00:37:12.060 align:start position:0%
can't submit for something before
 
00:37:13.910 --> 00:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
they've paid for it and it's similar for
 
00:37:16.010 --> 00:37:16.020 align:start position:0%
us on our end of it when we do the
 
00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:18.240 align:start position:0%
drawdown on the FED side we have to have
 
00:37:20.089 --> 00:37:20.099 align:start position:0%
expended those funds before we can
 
00:37:21.950 --> 00:37:21.960 align:start position:0%
submit for that drawdown on the federal
 
00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:23.089 align:start position:0%
submit for that drawdown on the federal
side

00:37:23.089 --> 00:37:23.099 align:start position:0%
side
 
00:37:25.430 --> 00:37:25.440 align:start position:0%
okay represent Tanner asked her 11th
 
00:37:28.490 --> 00:37:28.500 align:start position:0%
question really
 
00:37:30.349 --> 00:37:30.359 align:start position:0%
really about this on some level
 
00:37:30.359 --> 00:37:31.190 align:start position:0%
really about this on some level
um

00:37:31.190 --> 00:37:31.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:33.230 --> 00:37:33.240 align:start position:0%
can they use this money for college
 
00:37:35.870 --> 00:37:35.880 align:start position:0%
credit reimbursement in other words uh
 
00:37:37.849 --> 00:37:37.859 align:start position:0%
if we're retraining for Early Education
 
00:37:40.490 --> 00:37:40.500 align:start position:0%
yes so if they uh if the Lea decided
 
00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:42.720 align:start position:0%
that they wanted to pay for um some sort
 
00:37:44.690 --> 00:37:44.700 align:start position:0%
of training or if it's you know a
 
00:37:46.130 --> 00:37:46.140 align:start position:0%
college level course so they could
 
00:37:49.310 --> 00:37:49.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:50.990 --> 00:37:51.000 align:start position:0%
the way the training sometimes occurs
 
00:37:52.310 --> 00:37:52.320 align:start position:0%
then correct me if I'm right or wrong
 
00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
here is that
 
00:37:57.170 --> 00:37:57.180 align:start position:0%
teacher X Y and Z those three teachers
 
00:37:59.270 --> 00:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
want need some professional develop in
 
00:38:01.010 --> 00:38:01.020 align:start position:0%
this area so I take them out of the
 
00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:02.089 align:start position:0%
this area so I take them out of the
classroom

00:38:02.089 --> 00:38:02.099 align:start position:0%
classroom
 
00:38:04.609 --> 00:38:04.619 align:start position:0%
and I hire substitutes that go into the
 
00:38:06.770 --> 00:38:06.780 align:start position:0%
classroom the payment for the substitute
 
00:38:08.630 --> 00:38:08.640 align:start position:0%
teachers comes from
 
00:38:11.150 --> 00:38:11.160 align:start position:0%
represent Cascade and says yes yes title
 
00:38:13.370 --> 00:38:13.380 align:start position:0%
two yes they can pay for the substitutes
 
00:38:15.109 --> 00:38:15.119 align:start position:0%
they can pay for the courses all the
 
00:38:15.119 --> 00:38:16.849 align:start position:0%
they can pay for the courses all the
materials

00:38:16.849 --> 00:38:16.859 align:start position:0%
materials
 
00:38:18.710 --> 00:38:18.720 align:start position:0%
um any of a stipend that might need
 
00:38:20.870 --> 00:38:20.880 align:start position:0%
perhaps they're taking it after hours or
 
00:38:22.490 --> 00:38:22.500 align:start position:0%
they're doing extra work on the weekends
 
00:38:24.349 --> 00:38:24.359 align:start position:0%
or something like that they can pay for
 
00:38:25.970 --> 00:38:25.980 align:start position:0%
a stipend
 
00:38:29.810 --> 00:38:29.820 align:start position:0%
um for that any type of travel fees
 
00:38:32.510 --> 00:38:32.520 align:start position:0%
all of that is is allowable are the
 
00:38:34.670 --> 00:38:34.680 align:start position:0%
reimbursement for these costs based upon
 
00:38:37.490 --> 00:38:37.500 align:start position:0%
local negotiated agreements or is there
 
00:38:38.710 --> 00:38:38.720 align:start position:0%
a set amount the department has
 
00:38:41.329 --> 00:38:41.339 align:start position:0%
reimbursement or substitute we'll pay X
 
00:38:43.370 --> 00:38:43.380 align:start position:0%
numbered hours it may be different for
 
00:38:45.650 --> 00:38:45.660 align:start position:0%
each district to the negotiated you know
 
00:38:46.849 --> 00:38:46.859 align:start position:0%
it's whatever they're paying the
 
00:38:46.859 --> 00:38:48.250 align:start position:0%
it's whatever they're paying the
districts

00:38:48.250 --> 00:38:48.260 align:start position:0%
districts
 
00:38:52.010 --> 00:38:52.020 align:start position:0%
so one is paying 65 a day that's how
 
00:38:53.510 --> 00:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
much would be reimbursing including some
 
00:38:55.430 --> 00:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
stipends of some kind correct that's all
 
00:38:57.950 --> 00:38:57.960 align:start position:0%
based at the local level well I mean we
 
00:39:00.109 --> 00:39:00.119 align:start position:0%
do look at reasonableness so if we get
 
00:39:02.030 --> 00:39:02.040 align:start position:0%
some sort of request and it's you know a
 
00:39:03.950 --> 00:39:03.960 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars a day for a substitute
 
00:39:05.690 --> 00:39:05.700 align:start position:0%
we might take a peek at that and say can
 
00:39:07.130 --> 00:39:07.140 align:start position:0%
you give us some more information as to
 
00:39:08.990 --> 00:39:09.000 align:start position:0%
why but we've never seen anything quite
 
00:39:12.349 --> 00:39:12.359 align:start position:0%
like that thank you represent Luna thank
 
00:39:15.829 --> 00:39:15.839 align:start position:0%
you very much Mr chair so um I I just
 
00:39:16.790 --> 00:39:16.800 align:start position:0%
want to try to get a little bit of
 
00:39:19.810 --> 00:39:19.820 align:start position:0%
context for for this so so
 
00:39:22.130 --> 00:39:22.140 align:start position:0%
currently I think you said the state
 
00:39:24.710 --> 00:39:24.720 align:start position:0%
distributes about 10 million dollars in
 
00:39:28.130 --> 00:39:28.140 align:start position:0%
Title II is is a title 2A title 2A yes
 
00:39:31.370 --> 00:39:31.380 align:start position:0%
title two eight uh grants and um and
 
00:39:33.650 --> 00:39:33.660 align:start position:0%
about 1.9 of that might go to the
 
00:39:35.470 --> 00:39:35.480 align:start position:0%
Manchester School District
 
00:39:40.670 --> 00:39:40.680 align:start position:0%
1.375 1.3 sorry 1.3 or one 1.375 and
 
00:39:43.550 --> 00:39:43.560 align:start position:0%
then they will have
 
00:39:47.870 --> 00:39:47.880 align:start position:0%
um about 37 000 of that that will go
 
00:39:50.750 --> 00:39:50.760 align:start position:0%
um to the Equitable Services portions in
 
00:39:52.970 --> 00:39:52.980 align:start position:0%
that part of it not not really Theirs to
 
00:39:55.250 --> 00:39:55.260 align:start position:0%
choose from but then after that the rest
 
00:39:57.710 --> 00:39:57.720 align:start position:0%
sure so so again just trying to put that
 
00:39:59.870 --> 00:39:59.880 align:start position:0%
in context of approximately a 10 million
 
00:40:03.170 --> 00:40:03.180 align:start position:0%
dollar uh Title II grants about
 
00:40:07.190 --> 00:40:07.200 align:start position:0%
um about uh 13 to 14 of that goes to the
 
00:40:08.750 --> 00:40:08.760 align:start position:0%
Manchester School District they've got
 
00:40:11.329 --> 00:40:11.339 align:start position:0%
about eight or nine percent of the
 
00:40:11.339 --> 00:40:12.770 align:start position:0%
about eight or nine percent of the
states

00:40:12.770 --> 00:40:12.780 align:start position:0%
states
 
00:40:14.270 --> 00:40:14.280 align:start position:0%
um educate about eight or nine percent
 
00:40:16.430 --> 00:40:16.440 align:start position:0%
of the state students so that's that's
 
00:40:19.730 --> 00:40:19.740 align:start position:0%
you know it seems Seems and it seems
 
00:40:22.250 --> 00:40:22.260 align:start position:0%
reasonable correct and the formula so
 
00:40:26.810 --> 00:40:26.820 align:start position:0%
the question is uh if if if on top of
 
00:40:28.730 --> 00:40:28.740 align:start position:0%
the approximately 10 million in federal
 
00:40:32.089 --> 00:40:32.099 align:start position:0%
Title II another 500 000 was to come
 
00:40:34.130 --> 00:40:34.140 align:start position:0%
from the state how much of that do you
 
00:40:36.589 --> 00:40:36.599 align:start position:0%
think would be going to Manchester how
 
00:40:39.170 --> 00:40:39.180 align:start position:0%
much of that would might be going to um
 
00:40:41.270 --> 00:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
you know the the where school district
 
00:40:43.790 --> 00:40:43.800 align:start position:0%
and um do we think it's really out of
 
00:40:45.530 --> 00:40:45.540 align:start position:0%
the question that they wouldn't know how
 
00:40:48.349 --> 00:40:48.359 align:start position:0%
to spend that money or that money would
 
00:40:51.710 --> 00:40:51.720 align:start position:0%
get stranded or or something like that I
 
00:40:53.870 --> 00:40:53.880 align:start position:0%
mean it sounds like Title II is still
 
00:40:56.589 --> 00:40:56.599 align:start position:0%
going to be the Lion's Share of of of
 
00:40:59.630 --> 00:40:59.640 align:start position:0%
the the funds that that local school
 
00:41:01.430 --> 00:41:01.440 align:start position:0%
districts expend on professional
 
00:41:03.170 --> 00:41:03.180 align:start position:0%
development so I was just wondering if
 
00:41:05.810 --> 00:41:05.820 align:start position:0%
you could sort of you know if Manchester
 
00:41:09.589 --> 00:41:09.599 align:start position:0%
is getting 1.375 from Title II how much
 
00:41:11.630 --> 00:41:11.640 align:start position:0%
you think they might get you know
 
00:41:13.490 --> 00:41:13.500 align:start position:0%
proportional speaking out of the five
 
00:41:15.230 --> 00:41:15.240 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand and how much would a
 
00:41:16.609 --> 00:41:16.619 align:start position:0%
smaller District
 
00:41:17.750 --> 00:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
00:41:19.030 --> 00:41:19.040 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:41:21.530 --> 00:41:21.540 align:start position:0%
conceivably get you know proportionally
 
00:41:23.450 --> 00:41:23.460 align:start position:0%
out of the state portion of the current
 
00:41:25.790 --> 00:41:25.800 align:start position:0%
so looking at the proposed legislation
 
00:41:28.609 --> 00:41:28.619 align:start position:0%
it doesn't really say how to distribute
 
00:41:31.130 --> 00:41:31.140 align:start position:0%
the funds or how to base that so I I
 
00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:33.240 align:start position:0%
actually don't know how you would do
 
00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
that let's say if it was even done
 
00:41:36.950 --> 00:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
proportionally though if it's done
 
00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:38.410 align:start position:0%
proportionally though if it's done
proportionately

00:41:38.410 --> 00:41:38.420 align:start position:0%
proportionately
 
00:41:40.910 --> 00:41:40.920 align:start position:0%
if we're doing it if we were doing it
 
00:41:43.310 --> 00:41:43.320 align:start position:0%
based on the title II formula
 
00:41:46.790 --> 00:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
versus per pupil I think that would
 
00:41:49.490 --> 00:41:49.500 align:start position:0%
determine a difference because the title
 
00:41:51.589 --> 00:41:51.599 align:start position:0%
II formula also has the consideration
 
00:41:54.349 --> 00:41:54.359 align:start position:0%
for you know poverty data title one
 
00:41:56.750 --> 00:41:56.760 align:start position:0%
student sure well not to not to boil the
 
00:41:59.569 --> 00:41:59.579 align:start position:0%
ocean but just finger in the air back of
 
00:42:01.130 --> 00:42:01.140 align:start position:0%
the napkin back in the envelope
 
00:42:01.140 --> 00:42:02.810 align:start position:0%
the napkin back in the envelope
engineering

00:42:02.810 --> 00:42:02.820 align:start position:0%
engineering
 
00:42:06.290 --> 00:42:06.300 align:start position:0%
um uh design Manchester would see maybe
 
00:42:09.530 --> 00:42:09.540 align:start position:0%
fifty thousand dollars out of the out of
 
00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
the half million maybe I mean I'm not
 
00:42:13.910 --> 00:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
sure oh well I mean maybe it's let's say
 
00:42:15.829 --> 00:42:15.839 align:start position:0%
they got all of it let's say they got
 
00:42:17.150 --> 00:42:17.160 align:start position:0%
all the all five hundred thousand
 
00:42:19.250 --> 00:42:19.260 align:start position:0%
dollars of it went to Manchester is it
 
00:42:21.050 --> 00:42:21.060 align:start position:0%
inconceivable that a school district
 
00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:24.240 align:start position:0%
with 13 000 kids and how many teachers a
 
00:42:26.750 --> 00:42:26.760 align:start position:0%
thousand would would not be able to
 
00:42:28.550 --> 00:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
apply half million dollars in
 
00:42:30.230 --> 00:42:30.240 align:start position:0%
professional development over a thousand
 
00:42:32.329 --> 00:42:32.339 align:start position:0%
teachers in one year I mean are we
 
00:42:34.250 --> 00:42:34.260 align:start position:0%
really thinking that this money's not
 
00:42:36.050 --> 00:42:36.060 align:start position:0%
going to be used or somehow is going to
 
00:42:38.210 --> 00:42:38.220 align:start position:0%
be stranded
 
00:42:40.069 --> 00:42:40.079 align:start position:0%
um you know particularly in the context
 
00:42:43.250 --> 00:42:43.260 align:start position:0%
of how much every District including
 
00:42:45.290 --> 00:42:45.300 align:start position:0%
Manchester including where including
 
00:42:47.450 --> 00:42:47.460 align:start position:0%
Hopkinton is spending on professional
 
00:42:50.390 --> 00:42:50.400 align:start position:0%
development using Title II
 
00:42:54.410 --> 00:42:54.420 align:start position:0%
so and and especially that that this the
 
00:42:57.770 --> 00:42:57.780 align:start position:0%
state requirement here as as outlined in
 
00:43:01.069 --> 00:43:01.079 align:start position:0%
the legislation is so specific with
 
00:43:04.190 --> 00:43:04.200 align:start position:0%
regards to teachers very early in their
 
00:43:06.230 --> 00:43:06.240 align:start position:0%
career because Title II was not specific
 
00:43:10.010 --> 00:43:10.020 align:start position:0%
to that is that correct so it certainly
 
00:43:13.730 --> 00:43:13.740 align:start position:0%
is included so Venn diagram wise the the
 
00:43:16.609 --> 00:43:16.619 align:start position:0%
this program would be inside the title
 
00:43:20.349 --> 00:43:20.359 align:start position:0%
II bubble but it's very specific I mean
 
00:43:23.630 --> 00:43:23.640 align:start position:0%
I mean is is it even conceivable that
 
00:43:26.089 --> 00:43:26.099 align:start position:0%
that a district even one District even
 
00:43:28.609 --> 00:43:28.619 align:start position:0%
Manchester spending all of the money I
 
00:43:29.930 --> 00:43:29.940 align:start position:0%
always look at Patty when I was saying
 
00:43:32.150 --> 00:43:32.160 align:start position:0%
Manchester I mean it depends on the
 
00:43:34.430 --> 00:43:34.440 align:start position:0%
district it depends on their plan I I
 
00:43:36.829 --> 00:43:36.839 align:start position:0%
you know with title two we can't tell
 
00:43:38.990 --> 00:43:39.000 align:start position:0%
them what to spend their money on so
 
00:43:40.730 --> 00:43:40.740 align:start position:0%
they can look at all the allowabilities
 
00:43:42.829 --> 00:43:42.839 align:start position:0%
within Title II and they prioritize what
 
00:43:45.050 --> 00:43:45.060 align:start position:0%
their needs are so they're saying you
 
00:43:48.410 --> 00:43:48.420 align:start position:0%
know this is our priority versus that so
 
00:43:51.349 --> 00:43:51.359 align:start position:0%
that's a local decision I I really just
 
00:43:53.450 --> 00:43:53.460 align:start position:0%
look at what what are the facts as far
 
00:43:55.370 --> 00:43:55.380 align:start position:0%
as you know when I look at the dollars
 
00:43:57.829 --> 00:43:57.839 align:start position:0%
look at the time frame and look at
 
00:43:57.839 --> 00:43:58.490 align:start position:0%
look at the time frame and look at
um

00:43:58.490 --> 00:43:58.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:01.130 --> 00:44:01.140 align:start position:0%
the the you know Federal and and
 
00:44:03.710 --> 00:44:03.720 align:start position:0%
requirements with that piece of it so
 
00:44:05.930 --> 00:44:05.940 align:start position:0%
with Manchester specifically you know if
 
00:44:07.849 --> 00:44:07.859 align:start position:0%
we're looking at okay they would get the
 
00:44:10.190 --> 00:44:10.200 align:start position:0%
entire theoretically get the entire five
 
00:44:13.130 --> 00:44:13.140 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars currently in
 
00:44:16.490 --> 00:44:16.500 align:start position:0%
their title 22 23 Grant they out of the
 
00:44:18.470 --> 00:44:18.480 align:start position:0%
one point
 
00:44:21.589 --> 00:44:21.599 align:start position:0%
you know three million dollars
 
00:44:23.450 --> 00:44:23.460 align:start position:0%
um 131
 
00:44:25.370 --> 00:44:25.380 align:start position:0%
000 has been spent
 
00:44:27.650 --> 00:44:27.660 align:start position:0%
and of course they have an entire year
 
00:44:30.589 --> 00:44:30.599 align:start position:0%
and you know three months to use that up
 
00:44:32.510 --> 00:44:32.520 align:start position:0%
but that's just a given it's more likely
 
00:44:34.250 --> 00:44:34.260 align:start position:0%
proportionally Manchester would get more
 
00:44:36.770 --> 00:44:36.780 align:start position:0%
like 50 000 not all of the the entire
 
00:44:39.170 --> 00:44:39.180 align:start position:0%
engine and all we would look at is just
 
00:44:40.849 --> 00:44:40.859 align:start position:0%
making sure oh they spent that down
 
00:44:42.890 --> 00:44:42.900 align:start position:0%
first yeah excellent and then they can
 
00:44:45.470 --> 00:44:45.480 align:start position:0%
move on to their it just doesn't seem
 
00:44:48.050 --> 00:44:48.060 align:start position:0%
hard to me well we we are talking in
 
00:44:50.150 --> 00:44:50.160 align:start position:0%
some generalities here but when I'm
 
00:44:52.790 --> 00:44:52.800 align:start position:0%
reading this bill
 
00:44:55.670 --> 00:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
on line 18 it says development Grant to
 
00:44:58.430 --> 00:44:58.440 align:start position:0%
mass local school district or Title II
 
00:44:58.440 --> 00:45:00.829 align:start position:0%
mass local school district or Title II
funds

00:45:00.829 --> 00:45:00.839 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:45:03.050 --> 00:45:03.060 align:start position:0%
if if we're going to run into this
 
00:45:06.050 --> 00:45:06.060 align:start position:0%
question whether we can match with Title
 
00:45:08.390 --> 00:45:08.400 align:start position:0%
II money so we have to spend down these
 
00:45:11.270 --> 00:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
funds first before we can use title two
 
00:45:13.130 --> 00:45:13.140 align:start position:0%
monies I think we got a problem in the
 
00:45:14.930 --> 00:45:14.940 align:start position:0%
wording of this bill and it's going to
 
00:45:16.910 --> 00:45:16.920 align:start position:0%
need some work
 
00:45:19.609 --> 00:45:19.619 align:start position:0%
so so Mr chairman it is an early bill
 
00:45:26.450 --> 00:45:26.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:29.329 --> 00:45:29.339 align:start position:0%
eliminating the words
 
00:45:32.210 --> 00:45:32.220 align:start position:0%
to match local school district title two
 
00:45:32.220 --> 00:45:33.950 align:start position:0%
to match local school district title two
funds

00:45:33.950 --> 00:45:33.960 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:45:35.930 --> 00:45:35.940 align:start position:0%
and then pick up with the word utilize
 
00:45:38.210 --> 00:45:38.220 align:start position:0%
so it would so in lines 18 and 90 it
 
00:45:39.950 --> 00:45:39.960 align:start position:0%
would read professional development
 
00:45:41.690 --> 00:45:41.700 align:start position:0%
Grant utilized for the purpose of
 
00:45:43.069 --> 00:45:43.079 align:start position:0%
fulfilling the professional development
 
00:45:45.290 --> 00:45:45.300 align:start position:0%
activity that's one cleanup maybe yeah
 
00:45:48.050 --> 00:45:48.060 align:start position:0%
but then you have to deal with rules and
 
00:45:50.990 --> 00:45:51.000 align:start position:0%
the rules are not it's not clear here on
 
00:45:53.150 --> 00:45:53.160 align:start position:0%
line 13
 
00:45:55.910 --> 00:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
where the Department's person will
 
00:45:58.250 --> 00:45:58.260 align:start position:0%
develop rules to implement this grant
 
00:46:00.589 --> 00:46:00.599 align:start position:0%
program how long it's going to take that
 
00:46:02.809 --> 00:46:02.819 align:start position:0%
to occur and
 
00:46:05.150 --> 00:46:05.160 align:start position:0%
I I just see a lot of things which
 
00:46:07.490 --> 00:46:07.500 align:start position:0%
aren't clearly well defined what those
 
00:46:09.710 --> 00:46:09.720 align:start position:0%
rules specifically are going to be
 
00:46:12.170 --> 00:46:12.180 align:start position:0%
addressing rather than a broad statement
 
00:46:14.990 --> 00:46:15.000 align:start position:0%
which we've been asked not to do that in
 
00:46:17.450 --> 00:46:17.460 align:start position:0%
our legislation
 
00:46:20.150 --> 00:46:20.160 align:start position:0%
represent cascadden
 
00:46:22.010 --> 00:46:22.020 align:start position:0%
um I think I think this bill would need
 
00:46:24.550 --> 00:46:24.560 align:start position:0%
a lot of verbiage
 
00:46:28.849 --> 00:46:28.859 align:start position:0%
changes as well but in line six
 
00:46:31.670 --> 00:46:31.680 align:start position:0%
um use the funds for or to orientation
 
00:46:34.370 --> 00:46:34.380 align:start position:0%
support and I would put or Mentor
 
00:46:34.380 --> 00:46:36.230 align:start position:0%
support and I would put or Mentor
Educators

00:46:36.230 --> 00:46:36.240 align:start position:0%
Educators
 
00:46:39.349 --> 00:46:39.359 align:start position:0%
um definitely read just
 
00:46:43.130 --> 00:46:43.140 align:start position:0%
um redefine what an early educator is
 
00:46:43.140 --> 00:46:43.809 align:start position:0%
um redefine what an early educator is
um

00:46:43.809 --> 00:46:43.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:46.550 --> 00:46:46.560 align:start position:0%
new in the profession and I think it's
 
00:46:49.190 --> 00:46:49.200 align:start position:0%
described in one two three
 
00:46:51.109 --> 00:46:51.119 align:start position:0%
um not necessarily a grade level and
 
00:46:54.950 --> 00:46:54.960 align:start position:0%
then line 18 the grant
 
00:46:57.230 --> 00:46:57.240 align:start position:0%
um would have to be expended by the
 
00:46:59.170 --> 00:46:59.180 align:start position:0%
local schools prior to
 
00:47:02.270 --> 00:47:02.280 align:start position:0%
moving to the allocation of Title II
 
00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:04.010 align:start position:0%
moving to the allocation of Title II
funds

00:47:04.010 --> 00:47:04.020 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:47:06.950 --> 00:47:06.960 align:start position:0%
plus my question now is
 
00:47:09.430 --> 00:47:09.440 align:start position:0%
if I'm going to set up a mentor program
 
00:47:12.470 --> 00:47:12.480 align:start position:0%
and these funds are going to pay the
 
00:47:15.829 --> 00:47:15.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:18.770 --> 00:47:18.780 align:start position:0%
for that mentoring process
 
00:47:22.010 --> 00:47:22.020 align:start position:0%
how sustainable is this
 
00:47:25.010 --> 00:47:25.020 align:start position:0%
once you set up a program and you have
 
00:47:27.710 --> 00:47:27.720 align:start position:0%
five or six teachers who are trained in
 
00:47:30.770 --> 00:47:30.780 align:start position:0%
mentoring so you can use Title II funds
 
00:47:33.050 --> 00:47:33.060 align:start position:0%
from the pre say the previous year to
 
00:47:35.390 --> 00:47:35.400 align:start position:0%
train people to be mentors because it's
 
00:47:36.410 --> 00:47:36.420 align:start position:0%
a different
 
00:47:40.430 --> 00:47:40.440 align:start position:0%
you know skill set than coaching
 
00:47:43.849 --> 00:47:43.859 align:start position:0%
and and then you get this money
 
00:47:47.230 --> 00:47:47.240 align:start position:0%
to to implement that
 
00:47:50.630 --> 00:47:50.640 align:start position:0%
how do you sustain it is it a one one
 
00:47:53.390 --> 00:47:53.400 align:start position:0%
and done or is it a
 
00:47:55.609 --> 00:47:55.619 align:start position:0%
you know is the intent of this bill to
 
00:48:01.550 --> 00:48:01.560 align:start position:0%
be 500 000 allocation on an annual basis
 
00:48:02.930 --> 00:48:02.940 align:start position:0%
um so that would have to be clear
 
00:48:05.930 --> 00:48:05.940 align:start position:0%
because I would think districts
 
00:48:08.990 --> 00:48:09.000 align:start position:0%
if they think it's a one-year thing
 
00:48:10.970 --> 00:48:10.980 align:start position:0%
or they're not sure if the next year or
 
00:48:12.650 --> 00:48:12.660 align:start position:0%
subsequent years are going to be there
 
00:48:17.030 --> 00:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:19.730 --> 00:48:19.740 align:start position:0%
um we have a lot of funding sources like
 
00:48:22.309 --> 00:48:22.319 align:start position:0%
that so I just would question that
 
00:48:23.990 --> 00:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
because to have a good Mentor program
 
00:48:27.650 --> 00:48:27.660 align:start position:0%
you train your mentors and then you know
 
00:48:27.660 --> 00:48:29.290 align:start position:0%
you train your mentors and then you know
they

00:48:29.290 --> 00:48:29.300 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:48:33.410 --> 00:48:33.420 align:start position:0%
of a process which defines how the
 
00:48:36.950 --> 00:48:36.960 align:start position:0%
grants are going to be uh sought in
 
00:48:39.650 --> 00:48:39.660 align:start position:0%
terms of dates and times and is that an
 
00:48:42.710 --> 00:48:42.720 align:start position:0%
annual process is a bi-annual process it
 
00:48:44.630 --> 00:48:44.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't say
 
00:48:47.870 --> 00:48:47.880 align:start position:0%
um I I think this bill needs a lot of
 
00:48:50.630 --> 00:48:50.640 align:start position:0%
work before we
 
00:48:53.990 --> 00:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
we move it forward that's my position on
 
00:48:57.050 --> 00:48:57.060 align:start position:0%
it I like the idea of mentoring teachers
 
00:48:58.730 --> 00:48:58.740 align:start position:0%
I think that's wonderful I think we need
 
00:49:00.349 --> 00:49:00.359 align:start position:0%
to do it I'm on the teacher shortage
 
00:49:03.710 --> 00:49:03.720 align:start position:0%
committee that's a positive thing but
 
00:49:03.720 --> 00:49:04.490 align:start position:0%
committee that's a positive thing but
um

00:49:04.490 --> 00:49:04.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:06.770 --> 00:49:06.780 align:start position:0%
I think we've just come down with so
 
00:49:09.770 --> 00:49:09.780 align:start position:0%
many particular issues we're trying to
 
00:49:12.530 --> 00:49:12.540 align:start position:0%
say everything in one page of a bill and
 
00:49:15.050 --> 00:49:15.060 align:start position:0%
there's a lot more to this
 
00:49:16.730 --> 00:49:16.740 align:start position:0%
um we found that out when we're dealing
 
00:49:18.230 --> 00:49:18.240 align:start position:0%
school building Aid and really never
 
00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:19.550 align:start position:0%
school building Aid and really never
defined

00:49:19.550 --> 00:49:19.560 align:start position:0%
defined
 
00:49:21.410 --> 00:49:21.420 align:start position:0%
a lot of the issues dealing with the
 
00:49:24.230 --> 00:49:24.240 align:start position:0%
application process as Amy Clark is now
 
00:49:26.210 --> 00:49:26.220 align:start position:0%
determined we need to rewrite that to do
 
00:49:27.609 --> 00:49:27.619 align:start position:0%
it properly
 
00:49:29.870 --> 00:49:29.880 align:start position:0%
and the other thing I have a question on
 
00:49:31.550 --> 00:49:31.560 align:start position:0%
is the rules for the local professional
 
00:49:34.130 --> 00:49:34.140 align:start position:0%
development master plan
 
00:49:37.609 --> 00:49:37.619 align:start position:0%
are those developed by the board or the
 
00:49:41.569 --> 00:49:41.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:43.730 --> 00:49:43.740 align:start position:0%
in in in this in this the way it's
 
00:49:45.950 --> 00:49:45.960 align:start position:0%
worded in this this document here right
 
00:49:47.930 --> 00:49:47.940 align:start position:0%
well the local well the state has a
 
00:49:49.550 --> 00:49:49.560 align:start position:0%
master plan and then the local has to
 
00:49:51.050 --> 00:49:51.060 align:start position:0%
have a master plan and that's what your
 
00:49:52.730 --> 00:49:52.740 align:start position:0%
professional development is supposed to
 
00:49:54.650 --> 00:49:54.660 align:start position:0%
be all tied to your professional
 
00:49:56.990 --> 00:49:57.000 align:start position:0%
development but it reminds me to ask
 
00:50:00.109 --> 00:50:00.119 align:start position:0%
another question if there was money set
 
00:50:02.390 --> 00:50:02.400 align:start position:0%
aside by the state specifically for
 
00:50:04.490 --> 00:50:04.500 align:start position:0%
mentoring programs of
 
00:50:06.770 --> 00:50:06.780 align:start position:0%
new to the district or new to the
 
00:50:09.050 --> 00:50:09.060 align:start position:0%
profession teachers
 
00:50:11.030 --> 00:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
would that
 
00:50:13.430 --> 00:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
be enough separation from the title two
 
00:50:14.450 --> 00:50:14.460 align:start position:0%
so that they could be used
 
00:50:14.460 --> 00:50:16.730 align:start position:0%
so that they could be used
simultaneously

00:50:16.730 --> 00:50:16.740 align:start position:0%
simultaneously
 
00:50:19.550 --> 00:50:19.560 align:start position:0%
do you know because that would make
 
00:50:21.829 --> 00:50:21.839 align:start position:0%
another difference I don't think so
 
00:50:24.050 --> 00:50:24.060 align:start position:0%
I think it when it's well something
 
00:50:27.170 --> 00:50:27.180 align:start position:0%
that's allowable within yes yeah it's in
 
00:50:29.410 --> 00:50:29.420 align:start position:0%
the it's in I'm looking at the two-way
 
00:50:33.410 --> 00:50:33.420 align:start position:0%
discipline and it's it's got teacher
 
00:50:36.050 --> 00:50:36.060 align:start position:0%
mentoring in there and mentoring of
 
00:50:38.690 --> 00:50:38.700 align:start position:0%
course yes very valuable all I want to
 
00:50:41.270 --> 00:50:41.280 align:start position:0%
speak to is operationalizing the
 
00:50:45.170 --> 00:50:45.180 align:start position:0%
legislation as it's written and
 
00:50:45.180 --> 00:50:46.730 align:start position:0%
legislation as it's written and
potential

00:50:46.730 --> 00:50:46.740 align:start position:0%
potential
 
00:50:48.650 --> 00:50:48.660 align:start position:0%
um decisions that maybe need to be
 
00:50:51.710 --> 00:50:51.720 align:start position:0%
thought about as far as allocation
 
00:50:54.349 --> 00:50:54.359 align:start position:0%
um you know is there priorities
 
00:50:56.930 --> 00:50:56.940 align:start position:0%
that the study committee has looked at
 
00:50:59.990 --> 00:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
certain areas perhaps that
 
00:51:01.970 --> 00:51:01.980 align:start position:0%
those funds need to be targeted towards
 
00:51:03.890 --> 00:51:03.900 align:start position:0%
school districts that perhaps get a
 
00:51:03.900 --> 00:51:04.910 align:start position:0%
school districts that perhaps get a
small

00:51:04.910 --> 00:51:04.920 align:start position:0%
small
 
00:51:08.030 --> 00:51:08.040 align:start position:0%
pretty small Title II allocation perhaps
 
00:51:11.930 --> 00:51:11.940 align:start position:0%
or is it schools that have
 
00:51:13.790 --> 00:51:13.800 align:start position:0%
um you know when I think of we have
 
00:51:16.190 --> 00:51:16.200 align:start position:0%
school districts that have a lot of new
 
00:51:18.349 --> 00:51:18.359 align:start position:0%
teachers consistently
 
00:51:21.650 --> 00:51:21.660 align:start position:0%
would it be better served towards those
 
00:51:24.710 --> 00:51:24.720 align:start position:0%
districts because they end up doing a
 
00:51:27.349 --> 00:51:27.359 align:start position:0%
lot of that mentorship and training and
 
00:51:29.630 --> 00:51:29.640 align:start position:0%
then those teachers end up going
 
00:51:32.150 --> 00:51:32.160 align:start position:0%
to other schools and they you know I've
 
00:51:33.290 --> 00:51:33.300 align:start position:0%
talked and talking to some of those
 
00:51:34.910 --> 00:51:34.920 align:start position:0%
superintendents they're like we just
 
00:51:36.470 --> 00:51:36.480 align:start position:0%
kind of embrace that's who we are we
 
00:51:38.750 --> 00:51:38.760 align:start position:0%
have a lot of new Educators is better
 
00:51:40.849 --> 00:51:40.859 align:start position:0%
served that way I think there's just a
 
00:51:43.069 --> 00:51:43.079 align:start position:0%
lot of questions
 
00:51:45.650 --> 00:51:45.660 align:start position:0%
maybe that
 
00:51:49.309 --> 00:51:49.319 align:start position:0%
um the title should be changed with the
 
00:51:53.450 --> 00:51:53.460 align:start position:0%
specific intent of schools applying for
 
00:51:55.250 --> 00:51:55.260 align:start position:0%
money if they wanted to initiate a
 
00:51:56.930 --> 00:51:56.940 align:start position:0%
mentoring program within their District
 
00:51:59.690 --> 00:51:59.700 align:start position:0%
I don't know if that
 
00:52:01.609 --> 00:52:01.619 align:start position:0%
and then I don't know if it can be
 
00:52:04.010 --> 00:52:04.020 align:start position:0%
sustained through Title II and I would
 
00:52:06.470 --> 00:52:06.480 align:start position:0%
suggest maybe a name change as well new
 
00:52:08.750 --> 00:52:08.760 align:start position:0%
educator professional grants instead of
 
00:52:11.569 --> 00:52:11.579 align:start position:0%
early educator because early educator in
 
00:52:14.809 --> 00:52:14.819 align:start position:0%
the education World indicates
 
00:52:16.490 --> 00:52:16.500 align:start position:0%
um preschool teachers preschool or Early
 
00:52:19.130 --> 00:52:19.140 align:start position:0%
Education early childhood education
 
00:52:21.710 --> 00:52:21.720 align:start position:0%
what kind of accountability does the
 
00:52:25.430 --> 00:52:25.440 align:start position:0%
department have that the professional
 
00:52:28.730 --> 00:52:28.740 align:start position:0%
dollars used for the title II for
 
00:52:30.470 --> 00:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
development at the local level are being
 
00:52:32.990 --> 00:52:33.000 align:start position:0%
used appropriately so we do that first
 
00:52:37.309 --> 00:52:37.319 align:start position:0%
initial review so a a an Lea will submit
 
00:52:37.319 --> 00:52:38.270 align:start position:0%
initial review so a a an Lea will submit
their

00:52:38.270 --> 00:52:38.280 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:52:40.970 --> 00:52:40.980 align:start position:0%
activity to us describe it give us their
 
00:52:42.230 --> 00:52:42.240 align:start position:0%
budget for what they're spending it on
 
00:52:43.790 --> 00:52:43.800 align:start position:0%
so we review it initially for that
 
00:52:46.730 --> 00:52:46.740 align:start position:0%
allowability once it's approved and then
 
00:52:48.650 --> 00:52:48.660 align:start position:0%
they submit you know once the activity
 
00:52:50.150 --> 00:52:50.160 align:start position:0%
has been complete they're submitting a
 
00:52:52.250 --> 00:52:52.260 align:start position:0%
monthly report that that reimburses them
 
00:52:54.349 --> 00:52:54.359 align:start position:0%
for the costs associated with that
 
00:52:56.750 --> 00:52:56.760 align:start position:0%
activity and then through monitoring we
 
00:52:58.910 --> 00:52:58.920 align:start position:0%
have the fiscal monitoring Bureau
 
00:53:00.650 --> 00:53:00.660 align:start position:0%
Federal compliance does monitoring and
 
00:53:01.849 --> 00:53:01.859 align:start position:0%
then we also have programmatic
 
00:53:04.250 --> 00:53:04.260 align:start position:0%
monitoring that is done so we have our
 
00:53:06.109 --> 00:53:06.119 align:start position:0%
staff that will go into a district and
 
00:53:08.270 --> 00:53:08.280 align:start position:0%
say okay it said you know in your
 
00:53:10.130 --> 00:53:10.140 align:start position:0%
activity you're going to spend this
 
00:53:12.530 --> 00:53:12.540 align:start position:0%
these funds on this can we look at some
 
00:53:14.990 --> 00:53:15.000 align:start position:0%
of the evidence to support you know the
 
00:53:17.150 --> 00:53:17.160 align:start position:0%
implementation and it could be meeting
 
00:53:19.190 --> 00:53:19.200 align:start position:0%
minutes it could be training manuals it
 
00:53:21.290 --> 00:53:21.300 align:start position:0%
could be a variety of things so if we go
 
00:53:22.849 --> 00:53:22.859 align:start position:0%
and check that out are there further
 
00:53:24.170 --> 00:53:24.180 align:start position:0%
questions representative luno and then
 
00:53:26.150 --> 00:53:26.160 align:start position:0%
representative Lucas thank you very much
 
00:53:29.650 --> 00:53:29.660 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I just um I I'm I'm
 
00:53:33.109 --> 00:53:33.119 align:start position:0%
worried that maybe we're um we're we're
 
00:53:37.250 --> 00:53:37.260 align:start position:0%
micromanaging this too much and and
 
00:53:40.250 --> 00:53:40.260 align:start position:0%
um you know I I think it has been
 
00:53:43.069 --> 00:53:43.079 align:start position:0%
at least in other committees that not
 
00:53:43.079 --> 00:53:45.170 align:start position:0%
at least in other committees that not
not

00:53:45.170 --> 00:53:45.180 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:53:46.910 --> 00:53:46.920 align:start position:0%
um not standing committees but study
 
00:53:49.730 --> 00:53:49.740 align:start position:0%
committees and things that um that that
 
00:53:52.910 --> 00:53:52.920 align:start position:0%
really we try to operate legislation at
 
00:53:56.329 --> 00:53:56.339 align:start position:0%
the 30 000 foot level and rules comes
 
00:53:58.970 --> 00:53:58.980 align:start position:0%
down more to the the ground level and
 
00:54:02.089 --> 00:54:02.099 align:start position:0%
and I think the the way this bill
 
00:54:05.089 --> 00:54:05.099 align:start position:0%
um comes out is that it it it does
 
00:54:08.089 --> 00:54:08.099 align:start position:0%
um I think provide the department with
 
00:54:11.030 --> 00:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
with at least three
 
00:54:13.370 --> 00:54:13.380 align:start position:0%
um standards with which to establish
 
00:54:17.150 --> 00:54:17.160 align:start position:0%
this type of program and and I I guess
 
00:54:21.410 --> 00:54:21.420 align:start position:0%
my question to to you would be does the
 
00:54:25.250 --> 00:54:25.260 align:start position:0%
department collect data that would give
 
00:54:28.250 --> 00:54:28.260 align:start position:0%
them the ability to look at an
 
00:54:31.010 --> 00:54:31.020 align:start position:0%
application and determine whether a
 
00:54:33.170 --> 00:54:33.180 align:start position:0%
school district has
 
00:54:36.010 --> 00:54:36.020 align:start position:0%
um has has in fact
 
00:54:39.890 --> 00:54:39.900 align:start position:0%
the need to provide this sort of
 
00:54:42.290 --> 00:54:42.300 align:start position:0%
professional development because they've
 
00:54:44.030 --> 00:54:44.040 align:start position:0%
got a lot of
 
00:54:44.040 --> 00:54:46.069 align:start position:0%
got a lot of
um

00:54:46.069 --> 00:54:46.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:48.650 --> 00:54:48.660 align:start position:0%
new teachers teachers that are new to
 
00:54:51.589 --> 00:54:51.599 align:start position:0%
the uh to the profession and and I guess
 
00:54:53.930 --> 00:54:53.940 align:start position:0%
I don't know what what if the if the
 
00:54:56.150 --> 00:54:56.160 align:start position:0%
department has access to this data but
 
00:54:59.030 --> 00:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
anecdotally from my time in on the
 
00:55:00.829 --> 00:55:00.839 align:start position:0%
Hopkinton board
 
00:55:02.930 --> 00:55:02.940 align:start position:0%
um uh we got a lot of teachers from
 
00:55:02.940 --> 00:55:04.010 align:start position:0%
um uh we got a lot of teachers from
Franklin

00:55:04.010 --> 00:55:04.020 align:start position:0%
Franklin
 
00:55:06.410 --> 00:55:06.420 align:start position:0%
and and I'm not sure and I'm looking
 
00:55:08.630 --> 00:55:08.640 align:start position:0%
over Becky Wilson because she was she
 
00:55:10.670 --> 00:55:10.680 align:start position:0%
was employed by the district
 
00:55:12.290 --> 00:55:12.300 align:start position:0%
um I don't think we had that many
 
00:55:14.510 --> 00:55:14.520 align:start position:0%
teachers that who were new to the
 
00:55:17.089 --> 00:55:17.099 align:start position:0%
profession in Hopkinton
 
00:55:18.829 --> 00:55:18.839 align:start position:0%
um because they were already they were
 
00:55:21.109 --> 00:55:21.119 align:start position:0%
always coming out of Franklin three four
 
00:55:25.490 --> 00:55:25.500 align:start position:0%
five sometimes 15 years into uh into
 
00:55:28.609 --> 00:55:28.619 align:start position:0%
their profession so I'm thinking a grant
 
00:55:30.650 --> 00:55:30.660 align:start position:0%
program like this Hopkinton probably
 
00:55:32.150 --> 00:55:32.160 align:start position:0%
wouldn't even
 
00:55:35.450 --> 00:55:35.460 align:start position:0%
wouldn't even apply uh for it but I can
 
00:55:36.829 --> 00:55:36.839 align:start position:0%
imagine that there would be a lot of
 
00:55:39.589 --> 00:55:39.599 align:start position:0%
districts across the state who would
 
00:55:41.390 --> 00:55:41.400 align:start position:0%
find that this would really be
 
00:55:44.030 --> 00:55:44.040 align:start position:0%
beneficial because they're seeing such
 
00:55:47.870 --> 00:55:47.880 align:start position:0%
turnover that um that that providing
 
00:55:50.210 --> 00:55:50.220 align:start position:0%
some sort of training and development
 
00:55:53.630 --> 00:55:53.640 align:start position:0%
for for their new teachers might um
 
00:55:56.510 --> 00:55:56.520 align:start position:0%
might result in teachers staying there
 
00:55:58.609 --> 00:55:58.619 align:start position:0%
for longer or maybe even for their
 
00:56:02.510 --> 00:56:02.520 align:start position:0%
career and I've been told that that that
 
00:56:05.930 --> 00:56:05.940 align:start position:0%
that's a good thing for um for for
 
00:56:08.210 --> 00:56:08.220 align:start position:0%
school districts not to have you know
 
00:56:10.609 --> 00:56:10.619 align:start position:0%
such dramatic turnover every year it's
 
00:56:12.109 --> 00:56:12.119 align:start position:0%
good for school districts it's good for
 
00:56:13.849 --> 00:56:13.859 align:start position:0%
Education good for learning for the
 
00:56:13.859 --> 00:56:15.410 align:start position:0%
Education good for learning for the
students

00:56:15.410 --> 00:56:15.420 align:start position:0%
students
 
00:56:17.210 --> 00:56:17.220 align:start position:0%
um good for stability for the families
 
00:56:19.069 --> 00:56:19.079 align:start position:0%
that they're that they're serving I'm
 
00:56:21.470 --> 00:56:21.480 align:start position:0%
just wondering do you think the
 
00:56:23.990 --> 00:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
department has access to the data that
 
00:56:26.150 --> 00:56:26.160 align:start position:0%
would help them number one write rules
 
00:56:29.390 --> 00:56:29.400 align:start position:0%
so that we don't have to legislate at
 
00:56:31.910 --> 00:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
the at the ground level and number two
 
00:56:33.790 --> 00:56:33.800 align:start position:0%
be able to
 
00:56:37.609 --> 00:56:37.619 align:start position:0%
rate an application to uh to determine
 
00:56:40.970 --> 00:56:40.980 align:start position:0%
whether a a district would have need
 
00:56:43.190 --> 00:56:43.200 align:start position:0%
under this program
 
00:56:44.930 --> 00:56:44.940 align:start position:0%
um definitely I think we could do that
 
00:56:47.870 --> 00:56:47.880 align:start position:0%
and also I just wanted it shows on line
 
00:56:50.329 --> 00:56:50.339 align:start position:0%
23 within the first year of working in a
 
00:56:52.309 --> 00:56:52.319 align:start position:0%
new school or District so I think that
 
00:56:55.609 --> 00:56:55.619 align:start position:0%
even schools that may not have a uh that
 
00:56:57.829 --> 00:56:57.839 align:start position:0%
may be recruiting experienced teachers
 
00:57:00.049 --> 00:57:00.059 align:start position:0%
they could I mean apply technically for
 
00:57:02.569 --> 00:57:02.579 align:start position:0%
funding to support teachers that might
 
00:57:06.349 --> 00:57:06.359 align:start position:0%
be new to the school or District
 
00:57:07.910 --> 00:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
um the department would be able to go
 
00:57:10.790 --> 00:57:10.800 align:start position:0%
ahead and set rules and look um and do
 
00:57:12.770 --> 00:57:12.780 align:start position:0%
it you know Based on data and based on
 
00:57:12.780 --> 00:57:14.089 align:start position:0%
it you know Based on data and based on
evidence

00:57:14.089 --> 00:57:14.099 align:start position:0%
evidence
 
00:57:17.870 --> 00:57:17.880 align:start position:0%
um to support programs that might might
 
00:57:20.690 --> 00:57:20.700 align:start position:0%
be better served by the funding in
 
00:57:22.609 --> 00:57:22.619 align:start position:0%
addition to most of the you know
 
00:57:24.530 --> 00:57:24.540 align:start position:0%
application or competitive grants that
 
00:57:28.130 --> 00:57:28.140 align:start position:0%
we do put out we you know have our
 
00:57:31.069 --> 00:57:31.079 align:start position:0%
priorities identified in addition to
 
00:57:33.890 --> 00:57:33.900 align:start position:0%
then you know other criteria that is
 
00:57:36.049 --> 00:57:36.059 align:start position:0%
preferential but for the most part if
 
00:57:37.910 --> 00:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
we're looking at setting these are our
 
00:57:41.690 --> 00:57:41.700 align:start position:0%
you know priorities for these funds and
 
00:57:43.609 --> 00:57:43.619 align:start position:0%
then any applicants would need to meet
 
00:57:45.530 --> 00:57:45.540 align:start position:0%
those priorities so we could set the
 
00:57:47.089 --> 00:57:47.099 align:start position:0%
rules and then make the application
 
00:57:49.790 --> 00:57:49.800 align:start position:0%
based on those priorities such as a
 
00:57:51.170 --> 00:57:51.180 align:start position:0%
school with a high percentage of new
 
00:57:53.450 --> 00:57:53.460 align:start position:0%
teachers or some sort of metrics like
 
00:57:57.349 --> 00:57:57.359 align:start position:0%
that we could establish right thank you
 
00:58:00.049 --> 00:58:00.059 align:start position:0%
Melissa when this was put together this
 
00:58:03.589 --> 00:58:03.599 align:start position:0%
bill was the department ever queried as
 
00:58:05.930 --> 00:58:05.940 align:start position:0%
far as what how would you help us or
 
00:58:07.730 --> 00:58:07.740 align:start position:0%
could you help us in developing the bill
 
00:58:10.190 --> 00:58:10.200 align:start position:0%
were you involved with it I believe we
 
00:58:13.150 --> 00:58:13.160 align:start position:0%
did Supply a fiscal note
 
00:58:16.190 --> 00:58:16.200 align:start position:0%
first how about the language itself
 
00:58:18.290 --> 00:58:18.300 align:start position:0%
within it um I need to check with Steve
 
00:58:20.030 --> 00:58:20.040 align:start position:0%
Applewood he might have been consulted
 
00:58:21.829 --> 00:58:21.839 align:start position:0%
but I think we both agreed on the name
 
00:58:25.010 --> 00:58:25.020 align:start position:0%
for sure that the new educator was
 
00:58:27.230 --> 00:58:27.240 align:start position:0%
probably a more appropriate title
 
00:58:30.710 --> 00:58:30.720 align:start position:0%
representative like us thank you
 
00:58:34.069 --> 00:58:34.079 align:start position:0%
thank you I just want to make sure I
 
00:58:37.069 --> 00:58:37.079 align:start position:0%
understand the full consequences of this
 
00:58:37.079 --> 00:58:37.970 align:start position:0%
understand the full consequences of this
bill

00:58:37.970 --> 00:58:37.980 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:58:43.670 --> 00:58:43.680 align:start position:0%
so if we do vote for it then the the
 
00:58:47.930 --> 00:58:47.940 align:start position:0%
money that goes in must be expended
 
00:58:50.450 --> 00:58:50.460 align:start position:0%
before the title to before they have
 
00:58:52.849 --> 00:58:52.859 align:start position:0%
access to title 2 money so that's my
 
00:58:55.190 --> 00:58:55.200 align:start position:0%
first question is that correct so the I
 
00:58:57.049 --> 00:58:57.059 align:start position:0%
want to double check that with U.S
 
00:58:58.789 --> 00:58:58.799 align:start position:0%
Department of Education because my
 
00:59:02.089 --> 00:59:02.099 align:start position:0%
understanding of of two CFR is looking
 
00:59:04.910 --> 00:59:04.920 align:start position:0%
at the Lea level so when I read this I
 
00:59:06.890 --> 00:59:06.900 align:start position:0%
interpreted that the Lea would need to
 
00:59:08.390 --> 00:59:08.400 align:start position:0%
have that spent down before they would
 
00:59:10.069 --> 00:59:10.079 align:start position:0%
touch their Title II funds but now that
 
00:59:12.289 --> 00:59:12.299 align:start position:0%
it's been brought up I want to double
 
00:59:15.530 --> 00:59:15.540 align:start position:0%
check before I 100 say yes we can go
 
00:59:17.690 --> 00:59:17.700 align:start position:0%
forward without having to completely
 
00:59:20.329 --> 00:59:20.339 align:start position:0%
expend the 500 000 before we could touch
 
00:59:23.710 --> 00:59:23.720 align:start position:0%
our the state level Title II funds
 
00:59:28.190 --> 00:59:28.200 align:start position:0%
the flip side of that is if we don't
 
00:59:30.609 --> 00:59:30.619 align:start position:0%
pass this
 
00:59:34.910 --> 00:59:34.920 align:start position:0%
the school districts could use the title
 
00:59:37.670 --> 00:59:37.680 align:start position:0%
to money for mentoring
 
00:59:40.309 --> 00:59:40.319 align:start position:0%
and correct other stuff as it is now
 
00:59:43.789 --> 00:59:43.799 align:start position:0%
Title II title one
 
00:59:45.770 --> 00:59:45.780 align:start position:0%
um title one specifically if we're
 
00:59:47.510 --> 00:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
looking at Title One teachers they could
 
00:59:49.549 --> 00:59:49.559 align:start position:0%
use that professional development wise
 
00:59:51.710 --> 00:59:51.720 align:start position:0%
for that title three
 
00:59:53.569 --> 00:59:53.579 align:start position:0%
um would be for teachers that perhaps
 
00:59:55.670 --> 00:59:55.680 align:start position:0%
are English language learning for our
 
00:59:57.049 --> 00:59:57.059 align:start position:0%
English language learning students and
 
00:59:58.910 --> 00:59:58.920 align:start position:0%
any kind of training or mentorship
 
01:00:01.010 --> 01:00:01.020 align:start position:0%
around that piece of it
 
01:00:03.049 --> 01:00:03.059 align:start position:0%
um you could use
 
01:00:04.849 --> 01:00:04.859 align:start position:0%
um what was the other one I was thinking
 
01:00:04.859 --> 01:00:06.530 align:start position:0%
um what was the other one I was thinking
of

01:00:06.530 --> 01:00:06.540 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:00:08.750 --> 01:00:08.760 align:start position:0%
think that that might that might just be
 
01:00:10.190 --> 01:00:10.200 align:start position:0%
those too
 
01:00:12.650 --> 01:00:12.660 align:start position:0%
um but again it's you know at the local
 
01:00:15.170 --> 01:00:15.180 align:start position:0%
level absolutely to determine what their
 
01:00:17.150 --> 01:00:17.160 align:start position:0%
priorities are and where they see you
 
01:00:18.650 --> 01:00:18.660 align:start position:0%
know because they have to look of course
 
01:00:21.049 --> 01:00:21.059 align:start position:0%
across all of their
 
01:00:23.390 --> 01:00:23.400 align:start position:0%
um various programs and their needs of
 
01:00:25.490 --> 01:00:25.500 align:start position:0%
their district and look at whether it
 
01:00:27.289 --> 01:00:27.299 align:start position:0%
makes sense to just carve out the fund
 
01:00:29.329 --> 01:00:29.339 align:start position:0%
specifically for mentorship I I
 
01:00:31.549 --> 01:00:31.559 align:start position:0%
completely understand that that it's
 
01:00:33.410 --> 01:00:33.420 align:start position:0%
hard for them to you know make those
 
01:00:34.970 --> 01:00:34.980 align:start position:0%
choices at times
 
01:00:37.789 --> 01:00:37.799 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you Melissa
 
01:00:40.329 --> 01:00:40.339 align:start position:0%
um we have another bill which we have to
 
01:00:43.910 --> 01:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
do some discussion on are there any last
 
01:00:46.549 --> 01:00:46.559 align:start position:0%
questions which for yes representative
 
01:00:49.430 --> 01:00:49.440 align:start position:0%
just just the point I think you need to
 
01:00:52.210 --> 01:00:52.220 align:start position:0%
realize that the study group is around
 
01:00:55.190 --> 01:00:55.200 align:start position:0%
uh beginning teachers and retaining
 
01:00:55.200 --> 01:00:56.270 align:start position:0%
uh beginning teachers and retaining
teachers

01:00:56.270 --> 01:00:56.280 align:start position:0%
teachers
 
01:00:58.730 --> 01:00:58.740 align:start position:0%
and this also as Melissa pointed out
 
01:01:00.650 --> 01:01:00.660 align:start position:0%
does talk about the retention question
 
01:01:03.890 --> 01:01:03.900 align:start position:0%
because we heard testimony that when
 
01:01:05.510 --> 01:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
teachers move from one District
 
01:01:07.370 --> 01:01:07.380 align:start position:0%
experienced teachers move from one
 
01:01:09.589 --> 01:01:09.599 align:start position:0%
District to another they still need a
 
01:01:11.809 --> 01:01:11.819 align:start position:0%
mentor because it's a whole cultural
 
01:01:14.630 --> 01:01:14.640 align:start position:0%
thing that that new teachers to a
 
01:01:16.069 --> 01:01:16.079 align:start position:0%
district need to understand the
 
01:01:18.890 --> 01:01:18.900 align:start position:0%
procedures the policies the forms
 
01:01:21.289 --> 01:01:21.299 align:start position:0%
they've got to fill out so I think that
 
01:01:24.770 --> 01:01:24.780 align:start position:0%
this bill does uh address that issue too
 
01:01:27.710 --> 01:01:27.720 align:start position:0%
as well as a new teacher
 
01:01:30.230 --> 01:01:30.240 align:start position:0%
and I apologize I just remembered what I
 
01:01:32.150 --> 01:01:32.160 align:start position:0%
was thinking of a special education fund
 
01:01:35.390 --> 01:01:35.400 align:start position:0%
so idea funds can be used for mentorship
 
01:01:37.609 --> 01:01:37.619 align:start position:0%
of new special education directors or
 
01:01:39.190 --> 01:01:39.200 align:start position:0%
special education
 
01:01:41.870 --> 01:01:41.880 align:start position:0%
teachers that are maybe even new to that
 
01:01:44.270 --> 01:01:44.280 align:start position:0%
I just said an email come in from Dr
 
01:01:46.789 --> 01:01:46.799 align:start position:0%
Appleby he was not consulted on this
 
01:01:46.799 --> 01:01:48.230 align:start position:0%
Appleby he was not consulted on this
bill

01:01:48.230 --> 01:01:48.240 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:01:51.410 --> 01:01:51.420 align:start position:0%
represent dry thank you Mr chairman just
 
01:01:53.049 --> 01:01:53.059 align:start position:0%
a total change of
 
01:01:56.150 --> 01:01:56.160 align:start position:0%
subject there was in the Senate hearing
 
01:01:59.270 --> 01:01:59.280 align:start position:0%
uh talk of a contract that we currently
 
01:02:00.849 --> 01:02:00.859 align:start position:0%
have with the state of Colorado for
 
01:02:03.109 --> 01:02:03.119 align:start position:0%
virtual mentoring
 
01:02:05.390 --> 01:02:05.400 align:start position:0%
um that was 469 thousand dollars where
 
01:02:06.770 --> 01:02:06.780 align:start position:0%
does that money come from and who does
 
01:02:10.370 --> 01:02:10.380 align:start position:0%
that affect so that um fund uh that
 
01:02:12.829 --> 01:02:12.839 align:start position:0%
contract is with uh of course it's going
 
01:02:14.870 --> 01:02:14.880 align:start position:0%
to be a teach United it's a nonprofit
 
01:02:16.849 --> 01:02:16.859 align:start position:0%
organization that focuses specifically
 
01:02:20.750 --> 01:02:20.760 align:start position:0%
on small or rural schools and helping to
 
01:02:22.549 --> 01:02:22.559 align:start position:0%
establish systems helping to establish
 
01:02:25.190 --> 01:02:25.200 align:start position:0%
mentorship and it's not targeted
 
01:02:27.470 --> 01:02:27.480 align:start position:0%
specifically for new teachers but really
 
01:02:30.589 --> 01:02:30.599 align:start position:0%
creating those cohorts among small
 
01:02:32.569 --> 01:02:32.579 align:start position:0%
schools um it could be Charter Schools
 
01:02:34.970 --> 01:02:34.980 align:start position:0%
as well so they've come into New
 
01:02:37.250 --> 01:02:37.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they've created this cohort so
 
01:02:39.109 --> 01:02:39.119 align:start position:0%
that it allows you know particularly our
 
01:02:41.089 --> 01:02:41.099 align:start position:0%
smaller schools that may not you know
 
01:02:42.829 --> 01:02:42.839 align:start position:0%
when they have a professional Learning
 
01:02:44.930 --> 01:02:44.940 align:start position:0%
Community there might just be a few
 
01:02:47.030 --> 01:02:47.040 align:start position:0%
teachers within that school so it allows
 
01:02:48.950 --> 01:02:48.960 align:start position:0%
them to connect and have a much larger
 
01:02:50.930 --> 01:02:50.940 align:start position:0%
opportunity to go through you know
 
01:02:52.910 --> 01:02:52.920 align:start position:0%
implementing different systems what are
 
01:02:56.030 --> 01:02:56.040 align:start position:0%
the issues that they're experiencing how
 
01:02:58.089 --> 01:02:58.099 align:start position:0%
to's how um
 
01:03:00.109 --> 01:03:00.119 align:start position:0%
administrators can connect with other
 
01:03:02.870 --> 01:03:02.880 align:start position:0%
administrators so it's not so uh I guess
 
01:03:05.270 --> 01:03:05.280 align:start position:0%
isolating but that particular program is
 
01:03:07.069 --> 01:03:07.079 align:start position:0%
funded through our title to state level
 
01:03:07.079 --> 01:03:09.109 align:start position:0%
funded through our title to state level
funds

01:03:09.109 --> 01:03:09.119 align:start position:0%
funds
 
01:03:11.150 --> 01:03:11.160 align:start position:0%
um particularly and that is
 
01:03:13.370 --> 01:03:13.380 align:start position:0%
um targeted to any school that wants to
 
01:03:15.230 --> 01:03:15.240 align:start position:0%
participate so we we kind of put that
 
01:03:18.309 --> 01:03:18.319 align:start position:0%
information uh and uh
 
01:03:20.870 --> 01:03:20.880 align:start position:0%
that not application because they really
 
01:03:22.130 --> 01:03:22.140 align:start position:0%
didn't have to go through an application
 
01:03:24.109 --> 01:03:24.119 align:start position:0%
process but it was like you know this
 
01:03:25.789 --> 01:03:25.799 align:start position:0%
program is available if you're
 
01:03:28.010 --> 01:03:28.020 align:start position:0%
interested in joining on this program so
 
01:03:30.710 --> 01:03:30.720 align:start position:0%
we started off with I think five or six
 
01:03:33.109 --> 01:03:33.119 align:start position:0%
schools previously and then we've grown
 
01:03:35.089 --> 01:03:35.099 align:start position:0%
to 17 so I know there's several schools
 
01:03:36.410 --> 01:03:36.420 align:start position:0%
in Claremont that said you know we
 
01:03:38.450 --> 01:03:38.460 align:start position:0%
definitely want to join in and be a part
 
01:03:41.450 --> 01:03:41.460 align:start position:0%
of that and so we're adding in for the
 
01:03:43.849 --> 01:03:43.859 align:start position:0%
next cohort I think we're up to about
 
01:03:46.910 --> 01:03:46.920 align:start position:0%
17. yeah
 
01:03:50.510 --> 01:03:50.520 align:start position:0%
so does this that get kind of charged to
 
01:03:53.170 --> 01:03:53.180 align:start position:0%
the account of the school no no
 
01:03:55.730 --> 01:03:55.740 align:start position:0%
so our state level set aside that we
 
01:03:55.740 --> 01:03:56.690 align:start position:0%
so our state level set aside that we
have

01:03:56.690 --> 01:03:56.700 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:03:58.250 --> 01:03:58.260 align:start position:0%
um I think it was mentioned earlier you
 
01:04:00.829 --> 01:04:00.839 align:start position:0%
know there's a 9.8 million that goes
 
01:04:03.170 --> 01:04:03.180 align:start position:0%
um directly to the leas and then there's
 
01:04:05.390 --> 01:04:05.400 align:start position:0%
that you know art and title our entire
 
01:04:07.010 --> 01:04:07.020 align:start position:0%
allocation is
 
01:04:09.530 --> 01:04:09.540 align:start position:0%
um I think 10.6 somewhere in there and
 
01:04:11.690 --> 01:04:11.700 align:start position:0%
so we take the funds that are for our
 
01:04:13.670 --> 01:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
state level activities and we use it for
 
01:04:16.609 --> 01:04:16.619 align:start position:0%
activities like that thank you
 
01:04:18.530 --> 01:04:18.540 align:start position:0%
thank you very much again Melissa I
 
01:04:20.150 --> 01:04:20.160 align:start position:0%
appreciate your taking some time to come
 
01:04:22.309 --> 01:04:22.319 align:start position:0%
out and help us with this today sure one
 
01:04:24.230 --> 01:04:24.240 align:start position:0%
last thing we also use the state level
 
01:04:26.089 --> 01:04:26.099 align:start position:0%
set-aside Title II funds for
 
01:04:27.650 --> 01:04:27.660 align:start position:0%
paraprofessional training so we've
 
01:04:29.030 --> 01:04:29.040 align:start position:0%
offered it up to paraprofessionals
 
01:04:30.589 --> 01:04:30.599 align:start position:0%
Across the state or anyone that's
 
01:04:31.849 --> 01:04:31.859 align:start position:0%
interested in becoming a
 
01:04:34.010 --> 01:04:34.020 align:start position:0%
paraprofessional so we have our training
 
01:04:35.750 --> 01:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
that we've done for um this past year
 
01:04:37.190 --> 01:04:37.200 align:start position:0%
we're going to do another year of that
 
01:04:39.710 --> 01:04:39.720 align:start position:0%
so that people can come in even our
 
01:04:41.569 --> 01:04:41.579 align:start position:0%
administrators can come in and meet with
 
01:04:43.609 --> 01:04:43.619 align:start position:0%
potential candidates talk a little bit
 
01:04:45.230 --> 01:04:45.240 align:start position:0%
about their program and their schools
 
01:04:47.750 --> 01:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
and things like that so it's not just
 
01:04:51.910 --> 01:04:51.920 align:start position:0%
for teachers we target it towards
 
01:04:54.109 --> 01:04:54.119 align:start position:0%
paraprofessionals as well
 
01:04:58.250 --> 01:04:58.260 align:start position:0%
thank you so let's now switch gears a
 
01:04:59.589 --> 01:04:59.599 align:start position:0%
little bit and go into
 
01:05:02.030 --> 01:05:02.040 align:start position:0%
213. if anybody has to take a short
 
01:05:04.549 --> 01:05:04.559 align:start position:0%
break go ahead and do so
 
01:05:07.130 --> 01:05:07.140 align:start position:0%
um Tom Dolan you're you're standing in
 
01:05:09.170 --> 01:05:09.180 align:start position:0%
for represent cordelli today so you'd be
 
01:06:15.289 --> 01:06:15.299 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:45.229 --> 01:11:45.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:47.030 --> 01:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
a good morning for the record Diana
 
01:11:48.350 --> 01:11:48.360 align:start position:0%
Fenton and attorney with the Department
 
01:11:50.030 --> 01:11:50.040 align:start position:0%
of Education
 
01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:50.630 align:start position:0%
of Education
um

01:11:50.630 --> 01:11:50.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:53.330 --> 01:11:53.340 align:start position:0%
I think having the amendment to the
 
01:11:55.669 --> 01:11:55.679 align:start position:0%
definition of social media account
 
01:11:58.729 --> 01:11:58.739 align:start position:0%
would help to flush this out a little
 
01:12:00.410 --> 01:12:00.420 align:start position:0%
bit so I think if you keep the first
 
01:12:00.420 --> 01:12:01.550 align:start position:0%
bit so I think if you keep the first
part

01:12:01.550 --> 01:12:01.560 align:start position:0%
part
 
01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:03.110 align:start position:0%
part
um

01:12:03.110 --> 01:12:03.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:07.610 --> 01:12:07.620 align:start position:0%
of SB 213 I'm looking at it on the
 
01:12:10.850 --> 01:12:10.860 align:start position:0%
website lines three through seven and
 
01:12:14.270 --> 01:12:14.280 align:start position:0%
then add in this paragraph that I wrote
 
01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:16.610 align:start position:0%
then add in this paragraph that I wrote
yesterday

01:12:16.610 --> 01:12:16.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:16.620 --> 01:12:18.110 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:12:18.110 --> 01:12:18.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:19.729 --> 01:12:19.739 align:start position:0%
I think that way they won't conflict
 
01:12:32.630 --> 01:12:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:38.709 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:12:38.709 --> 01:12:38.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:41.870 --> 01:12:41.880 align:start position:0%
section one which it which amends the
 
01:12:43.729 --> 01:12:43.739 align:start position:0%
definition of social media account as
 
01:12:47.209 --> 01:12:47.219 align:start position:0%
found in 189.70
 
01:12:49.729 --> 01:12:49.739 align:start position:0%
to clarify the definition shall not
 
01:12:50.930 --> 01:12:50.940 align:start position:0%
apply to platforms used for
 
01:12:52.610 --> 01:12:52.620 align:start position:0%
demonstrating evidence in student career
 
01:12:52.620 --> 01:12:53.630 align:start position:0%
demonstrating evidence in student career
development

01:12:53.630 --> 01:12:53.640 align:start position:0%
development
 
01:12:55.970 --> 01:12:55.980 align:start position:0%
so that amends that definition
 
01:12:58.010 --> 01:12:58.020 align:start position:0%
and then this
 
01:13:00.050 --> 01:13:00.060 align:start position:0%
section two
 
01:13:02.270 --> 01:13:02.280 align:start position:0%
you replace that so that's effectively
 
01:13:04.310 --> 01:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
lines eight through fifteen you replace
 
01:13:07.390 --> 01:13:07.400 align:start position:0%
it with what I provided to you yesterday
 
01:13:09.890 --> 01:13:09.900 align:start position:0%
and that would amend
 
01:13:09.900 --> 01:13:14.090 align:start position:0%
and that would amend
189.66

01:13:14.090 --> 01:13:14.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:17.050 --> 01:13:17.060 align:start position:0%
and instead of creating a new section in
 
01:13:21.110 --> 01:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
189.66 I simply added that language
 
01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:22.250 align:start position:0%
189.66 I simply added that language
um

01:13:22.250 --> 01:13:22.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:22.260 --> 01:13:23.750 align:start position:0%
um
to

01:13:23.750 --> 01:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:13:25.490 --> 01:13:25.500 align:start position:0%
the enumerated
 
01:13:31.130 --> 01:13:31.140 align:start position:0%
provision so if you look at 189.66
 
01:13:39.250 --> 01:13:39.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:43.250 --> 01:13:43.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:45.290 --> 01:13:45.300 align:start position:0%
um it's a lot of numbers running around
 
01:13:45.300 --> 01:13:46.970 align:start position:0%
um it's a lot of numbers running around
here

01:13:46.970 --> 01:13:46.980 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:13:49.310 --> 01:13:49.320 align:start position:0%
um each local Education Agency shall
 
01:13:51.470 --> 01:13:51.480 align:start position:0%
develop data and privacy governance plan
 
01:13:53.330 --> 01:13:53.340 align:start position:0%
which shall be presented to the school
 
01:13:55.850 --> 01:13:55.860 align:start position:0%
board for review and approval so the
 
01:13:59.090 --> 01:13:59.100 align:start position:0%
thought was if it's part of an ongoing
 
01:14:00.890 --> 01:14:00.900 align:start position:0%
plan that the district does and gets
 
01:14:02.870 --> 01:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
approval from the school board you just
 
01:14:06.649 --> 01:14:06.659 align:start position:0%
add it to those enumerated Provisions so
 
01:14:08.450 --> 01:14:08.460 align:start position:0%
we added in F
 
01:14:09.890 --> 01:14:09.900 align:start position:0%
which would be
 
01:14:11.450 --> 01:14:11.460 align:start position:0%
students participating career
 
01:14:14.630 --> 01:14:14.640 align:start position:0%
exploration or CTE May with parental
 
01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:16.790 align:start position:0%
exploration or CTE May with parental
consent

01:14:16.790 --> 01:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
consent
 
01:14:20.270 --> 01:14:20.280 align:start position:0%
register for technology platforms so so
 
01:14:22.370 --> 01:14:22.380 align:start position:0%
is that the same as Waters
 
01:14:26.090 --> 01:14:26.100 align:start position:0%
um but but it's 5f instead of instead of
 
01:14:27.830 --> 01:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
a new Roman six
 
01:14:31.090 --> 01:14:31.100 align:start position:0%
very similar no I think it's like
 
01:14:33.229 --> 01:14:33.239 align:start position:0%
it's not identical where's the
 
01:14:35.149 --> 01:14:35.159 align:start position:0%
difference the concept is similar so
 
01:14:39.350 --> 01:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
Waters was amending wedding 189.70.
 
01:14:42.229 --> 01:14:42.239 align:start position:0%
no 189.66
 
01:14:45.410 --> 01:14:45.420 align:start position:0%
. in watersville assist the students
 
01:14:52.669 --> 01:14:52.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:55.370 --> 01:14:55.380 align:start position:0%
I'm talking about 12 37 minutes program
 
01:14:57.410 --> 01:14:57.420 align:start position:0%
of study no I mean I think it's very
 
01:14:59.990 --> 01:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
clear but now we're saying it's an
 
01:15:02.450 --> 01:15:02.460 align:start position:0%
approved program of study approved by
 
01:15:07.189 --> 01:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
the CTE the instructor Etc okay yeah I I
 
01:15:09.470 --> 01:15:09.480 align:start position:0%
think that's anything yeah that makes a
 
01:15:12.890 --> 01:15:12.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:14.870 --> 01:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
but I mean it's essentially on the on
 
01:15:18.950 --> 01:15:18.960 align:start position:0%
the same um same concept as as what
 
01:15:22.250 --> 01:15:22.260 align:start position:0%
Waters was talking about I
 
01:15:25.310 --> 01:15:25.320 align:start position:0%
and then putting it in 5f as opposed to
 
01:15:27.470 --> 01:15:27.480 align:start position:0%
creating a new Roman six correct yeah
 
01:15:30.229 --> 01:15:30.239 align:start position:0%
yeah that makes sense
 
01:15:32.450 --> 01:15:32.460 align:start position:0%
we didn't want to call it out as its own
 
01:15:34.310 --> 01:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
section for fear that it might
 
01:15:36.950 --> 01:15:36.960 align:start position:0%
contradict with five and so we wanted to
 
01:15:39.530 --> 01:15:39.540 align:start position:0%
embed it in five but uh representative
 
01:15:41.930 --> 01:15:41.940 align:start position:0%
Leno to your point it's very much just
 
01:15:44.990 --> 01:15:45.000 align:start position:0%
taked on the we took the concept and we
 
01:15:47.149 --> 01:15:47.159 align:start position:0%
just massaged it a little bit and
 
01:15:48.290 --> 01:15:48.300 align:start position:0%
figured out how to make a little
 
01:15:48.300 --> 01:15:49.790 align:start position:0%
figured out how to make a little
stronger

01:15:49.790 --> 01:15:49.800 align:start position:0%
stronger
 
01:15:49.800 --> 01:15:57.350 align:start position:0%
stronger
yes

01:15:57.350 --> 01:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:59.390 --> 01:15:59.400 align:start position:0%
and so you do believe in section one
 
01:16:01.010 --> 01:16:01.020 align:start position:0%
belongs NW
 
01:16:03.050 --> 01:16:03.060 align:start position:0%
because I have two amendments coming one
 
01:16:03.060 --> 01:16:03.970 align:start position:0%
because I have two amendments coming one
which

01:16:03.970 --> 01:16:03.980 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:16:07.250 --> 01:16:07.260 align:start position:0%
last part it should be it yeah and
 
01:16:09.050 --> 01:16:09.060 align:start position:0%
another one coming with the second one
 
01:16:12.410 --> 01:16:12.420 align:start position:0%
as he came to us from the Senate
 
01:16:15.770 --> 01:16:15.780 align:start position:0%
with section two that you did I would
 
01:16:17.870 --> 01:16:17.880 align:start position:0%
suggest keeping in section one I think
 
01:16:19.189 --> 01:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
it it
 
01:16:22.010 --> 01:16:22.020 align:start position:0%
um strengthens the definition and it
 
01:16:24.050 --> 01:16:24.060 align:start position:0%
would alleviate any potential that it
 
01:16:28.430 --> 01:16:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:28.440 --> 01:16:31.270 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:16:31.270 --> 01:16:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:33.290 --> 01:16:33.300 align:start position:0%
Amendment here wasn't that different
 
01:16:38.090 --> 01:16:38.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:40.370 --> 01:16:40.380 align:start position:0%
I have it yes
 
01:16:47.020 --> 01:16:47.030 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:47.030 --> 01:16:50.570 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:16:50.570 --> 01:16:50.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:53.750 --> 01:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
M thank you mine basically took
 
01:16:57.470 --> 01:16:57.480 align:start position:0%
um that second part the waters Amendment
 
01:17:01.010 --> 01:17:01.020 align:start position:0%
but it added two things
 
01:17:01.020 --> 01:17:02.709 align:start position:0%
but it added two things
um

01:17:02.709 --> 01:17:02.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:05.990 --> 01:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
it says
 
01:17:11.090 --> 01:17:11.100 align:start position:0%
hang on and that it's not social media
 
01:17:13.970 --> 01:17:13.980 align:start position:0%
and then it defines social media for the
 
01:17:15.950 --> 01:17:15.960 align:start position:0%
purposes of six this section means the
 
01:17:17.990 --> 01:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
social networking website that is used
 
01:17:19.610 --> 01:17:19.620 align:start position:0%
by a Kerner prospective student
 
01:17:23.149 --> 01:17:23.159 align:start position:0%
primarily for personal Communications so
 
01:17:27.410 --> 01:17:27.420 align:start position:0%
basically it was to hone in on or zero
 
01:17:28.669 --> 01:17:28.679 align:start position:0%
in on
 
01:17:28.679 --> 01:17:29.330 align:start position:0%
in on
um

01:17:29.330 --> 01:17:29.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:33.649 --> 01:17:33.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:37.870 --> 01:17:37.880 align:start position:0%
Adobe that kind of thing but not
 
01:17:41.209 --> 01:17:41.219 align:start position:0%
specifically not things like LinkedIn
 
01:17:44.570 --> 01:17:44.580 align:start position:0%
because then that puts the students
 
01:17:47.149 --> 01:17:47.159 align:start position:0%
at risk for all of the things that
 
01:17:48.890 --> 01:17:48.900 align:start position:0%
happen with
 
01:17:51.470 --> 01:17:51.480 align:start position:0%
social media that we've seen where
 
01:17:53.870 --> 01:17:53.880 align:start position:0%
people get Shadow banned and all kinds
 
01:17:55.970 --> 01:17:55.980 align:start position:0%
of stuff because they held the wrong
 
01:17:58.370 --> 01:17:58.380 align:start position:0%
opinion on something and so to get
 
01:17:58.380 --> 01:17:59.689 align:start position:0%
opinion on something and so to get
students

01:17:59.689 --> 01:17:59.699 align:start position:0%
students
 
01:18:04.430 --> 01:18:04.440 align:start position:0%
used to using a platform for
 
01:18:06.890 --> 01:18:06.900 align:start position:0%
um career readiness
 
01:18:09.169 --> 01:18:09.179 align:start position:0%
or if you're looking for a job which
 
01:18:11.990 --> 01:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
then in the future they can be Shadow
 
01:18:15.470 --> 01:18:15.480 align:start position:0%
banned on and then not get jobs because
 
01:18:15.480 --> 01:18:17.330 align:start position:0%
banned on and then not get jobs because
they

01:18:17.330 --> 01:18:17.340 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:18:19.729 --> 01:18:19.739 align:start position:0%
posted something that wasn't bad but
 
01:18:23.630 --> 01:18:23.640 align:start position:0%
that wasn't according to current
 
01:18:26.990 --> 01:18:27.000 align:start position:0%
um approved ideas and we don't really
 
01:18:28.910 --> 01:18:28.920 align:start position:0%
want to get students
 
01:18:32.090 --> 01:18:32.100 align:start position:0%
started down that line
 
01:18:35.149 --> 01:18:35.159 align:start position:0%
so they would still be able to do
 
01:18:38.390 --> 01:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
take the Adobe tests all of that kind of
 
01:18:41.390 --> 01:18:41.400 align:start position:0%
stuff still get real badges not the
 
01:18:43.430 --> 01:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
LinkedIn badges which nobody pays
 
01:18:46.850 --> 01:18:46.860 align:start position:0%
attention to but real badges and all of
 
01:18:49.010 --> 01:18:49.020 align:start position:0%
that stuff they just wouldn't be able to
 
01:18:52.550 --> 01:18:52.560 align:start position:0%
do social media in whatever form that is
 
01:18:55.729 --> 01:18:55.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:58.010 --> 01:18:58.020 align:start position:0%
so it was kind of taking it all of the
 
01:18:59.689 --> 01:18:59.699 align:start position:0%
things that we did in the subcommittee
 
01:19:00.950 --> 01:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
kind of trying to take into
 
01:19:04.669 --> 01:19:04.679 align:start position:0%
consideration all of those things making
 
01:19:06.649 --> 01:19:06.659 align:start position:0%
it clear that yes they can do these
 
01:19:08.470 --> 01:19:08.480 align:start position:0%
things even though currently they can
 
01:19:11.810 --> 01:19:11.820 align:start position:0%
just to make it clear that they can but
 
01:19:14.990 --> 01:19:15.000 align:start position:0%
that it's not to include social media
 
01:19:17.270 --> 01:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
which was a concern amongst a number of
 
01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:32.330 align:start position:0%
which was a concern amongst a number of
people

01:19:32.330 --> 01:19:32.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:35.330 --> 01:19:35.340 align:start position:0%
by putting social media in this section
 
01:19:38.209 --> 01:19:38.219 align:start position:0%
alone already in 1956
 
01:19:40.850 --> 01:19:40.860 align:start position:0%
this amount of act that terminology
 
01:19:43.430 --> 01:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
ended this whereas that traditionally
 
01:19:49.790 --> 01:19:49.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:54.770 --> 01:19:54.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:12.770 --> 01:20:12.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:12.780 --> 01:20:15.530 align:start position:0%
 
student

01:20:15.530 --> 01:20:15.540 align:start position:0%
student
 
01:20:17.930 --> 01:20:17.940 align:start position:0%
social media notice it's called
 
01:20:17.940 --> 01:20:19.669 align:start position:0%
social media notice it's called
improvements

01:20:19.669 --> 01:20:19.679 align:start position:0%
improvements
 
01:20:23.390 --> 01:20:23.400 align:start position:0%
such as the school approves social media
 
01:20:27.229 --> 01:20:27.239 align:start position:0%
as part of the students program than
 
01:20:30.169 --> 01:20:30.179 align:start position:0%
that then they could do we we should use
 
01:20:34.729 --> 01:20:34.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:38.570 --> 01:20:38.580 align:start position:0%
if a school decides to approve a social
 
01:20:41.689 --> 01:20:41.699 align:start position:0%
media platform as part of uh School
 
01:20:41.699 --> 01:20:44.030 align:start position:0%
media platform as part of uh School
students

01:20:44.030 --> 01:20:44.040 align:start position:0%
students
 
01:20:44.040 --> 01:20:44.870 align:start position:0%
students
um

01:20:44.870 --> 01:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:44.880 --> 01:20:46.610 align:start position:0%
um
program

01:20:46.610 --> 01:20:46.620 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:20:46.620 --> 01:20:48.290 align:start position:0%
program
then

01:20:48.290 --> 01:20:48.300 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:20:51.169 --> 01:20:51.179 align:start position:0%
unless we exclude social media they'd be
 
01:20:54.530 --> 01:20:54.540 align:start position:0%
able to use that under
 
01:20:57.770 --> 01:20:57.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:59.810 --> 01:20:59.820 align:start position:0%
representative cascadden
 
01:21:02.870 --> 01:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
um but it does require parental consent
 
01:21:02.880 --> 01:21:04.430 align:start position:0%
um but it does require parental consent
so

01:21:04.430 --> 01:21:04.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:21:06.350 --> 01:21:06.360 align:start position:0%
some parents would just say known some
 
01:21:08.870 --> 01:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
would say yeah I'm fine with that
 
01:21:08.880 --> 01:21:15.950 align:start position:0%
would say yeah I'm fine with that
yes

01:21:15.950 --> 01:21:15.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:18.470 --> 01:21:18.480 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't have with the other
 
01:21:20.229 --> 01:21:20.239 align:start position:0%
amendment that represented
 
01:21:23.090 --> 01:21:23.100 align:start position:0%
representative elevated you again not
 
01:21:24.950 --> 01:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
the general but I appreciate it thank
 
01:21:26.450 --> 01:21:26.460 align:start position:0%
you attorney
 
01:21:29.470 --> 01:21:29.480 align:start position:0%
um attorney general there you go
 
01:21:32.510 --> 01:21:32.520 align:start position:0%
I think you have the word approved
 
01:21:34.669 --> 01:21:34.679 align:start position:0%
program of studies in there which I
 
01:21:36.709 --> 01:21:36.719 align:start position:0%
think is very important that the program
 
01:21:40.610 --> 01:21:40.620 align:start position:0%
be approved as part of that CTE career
 
01:21:45.050 --> 01:21:45.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:47.689 --> 01:21:47.699 align:start position:0%
which the amendment you crafted does
 
01:21:49.910 --> 01:21:49.920 align:start position:0%
have that terminology in there
 
01:21:57.350 --> 01:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:00.410 --> 01:22:00.420 align:start position:0%
well they have Regional commissions that
 
01:22:02.570 --> 01:22:02.580 align:start position:0%
are taking care of the ctes
 
01:22:06.649 --> 01:22:06.659 align:start position:0%
they have to approve much that also the
 
01:22:09.770 --> 01:22:09.780 align:start position:0%
sending school if a receiving Center is
 
01:22:13.130 --> 01:22:13.140 align:start position:0%
going to offer credit for a course that
 
01:22:15.290 --> 01:22:15.300 align:start position:0%
has to be approved by the sending
 
01:22:17.990 --> 01:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
District so I imagine the saddening
 
01:22:20.209 --> 01:22:20.219 align:start position:0%
district is very much involved with this
 
01:22:28.910 --> 01:22:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:31.250 --> 01:22:31.260 align:start position:0%
any further discussion on we have
 
01:22:33.169 --> 01:22:33.179 align:start position:0%
several amendments possibilities here in
 
01:22:41.270 --> 01:22:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:43.209 --> 01:22:43.219 align:start position:0%
pardon me
 
01:22:45.910 --> 01:22:45.920 align:start position:0%
represent a hall thank you
 
01:22:48.950 --> 01:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
representative Lucas could you just I
 
01:22:49.850 --> 01:22:49.860 align:start position:0%
was trying to follow what you're saying
 
01:22:51.830 --> 01:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
they talk about LinkedIn where does
 
01:22:54.110 --> 01:22:54.120 align:start position:0%
LinkedIn fit into this
 
01:22:57.050 --> 01:22:57.060 align:start position:0%
LinkedIn is a social media platform
 
01:23:00.050 --> 01:23:00.060 align:start position:0%
and it would not be covered under my
 
01:23:03.470 --> 01:23:03.480 align:start position:0%
Amendment okay specifically
 
01:23:06.229 --> 01:23:06.239 align:start position:0%
so in subcommittee or actually in
 
01:23:08.270 --> 01:23:08.280 align:start position:0%
committee here as well we heard that
 
01:23:11.330 --> 01:23:11.340 align:start position:0%
this is all about LinkedIn
 
01:23:13.970 --> 01:23:13.980 align:start position:0%
that you're saying no LinkedIn right
 
01:23:15.890 --> 01:23:15.900 align:start position:0%
because there were numerous people on
 
01:23:18.050 --> 01:23:18.060 align:start position:0%
this committee who found all kinds of
 
01:23:21.229 --> 01:23:21.239 align:start position:0%
issues with LinkedIn and specifically
 
01:23:24.830 --> 01:23:24.840 align:start position:0%
did not want that to be there and so
 
01:23:26.870 --> 01:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
that's why I tried to
 
01:23:28.910 --> 01:23:28.920 align:start position:0%
cover what
 
01:23:31.570 --> 01:23:31.580 align:start position:0%
the CTE people were trying to cover
 
01:23:35.830 --> 01:23:35.840 align:start position:0%
without pulling in LinkedIn which was
 
01:23:38.270 --> 01:23:38.280 align:start position:0%
what a number of people on the committee
 
01:23:42.110 --> 01:23:42.120 align:start position:0%
objected to they follow up with it so
 
01:23:45.290 --> 01:23:45.300 align:start position:0%
when we heard Pam McLeod and Jeff beard
 
01:23:47.570 --> 01:23:47.580 align:start position:0%
both speak about this they were all
 
01:23:49.310 --> 01:23:49.320 align:start position:0%
about the LinkedIn and we talked about
 
01:23:51.590 --> 01:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
the data the privacy and all that that
 
01:23:54.590 --> 01:23:54.600 align:start position:0%
was a concern where Pam said that we she
 
01:23:57.470 --> 01:23:57.480 align:start position:0%
needed six months to figure that all out
 
01:24:00.649 --> 01:24:00.659 align:start position:0%
the data privacy and all that stuff
 
01:24:02.930 --> 01:24:02.940 align:start position:0%
so I'm not sure we ever heard no
 
01:24:05.450 --> 01:24:05.460 align:start position:0%
LinkedIn because we heard this is a
 
01:24:06.590 --> 01:24:06.600 align:start position:0%
LinkedIn bill
 
01:24:11.649 --> 01:24:11.659 align:start position:0%
right I mean the first part
 
01:24:14.450 --> 01:24:14.460 align:start position:0%
not the amendment that the CTE wanted
 
01:24:18.110 --> 01:24:18.120 align:start position:0%
but the first part yes but then they
 
01:24:20.510 --> 01:24:20.520 align:start position:0%
agreed that there were problems with the
 
01:24:20.520 --> 01:24:22.490 align:start position:0%
agreed that there were problems with the
LinkedIn

01:24:22.490 --> 01:24:22.500 align:start position:0%
LinkedIn
 
01:24:25.370 --> 01:24:25.380 align:start position:0%
and so that's why I took that out
 
01:24:27.950 --> 01:24:27.960 align:start position:0%
because that does leave the students
 
01:24:32.870 --> 01:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
open to the whims of the social media
 
01:24:32.880 --> 01:24:34.669 align:start position:0%
open to the whims of the social media
platform

01:24:34.669 --> 01:24:34.679 align:start position:0%
platform
 
01:24:38.149 --> 01:24:38.159 align:start position:0%
okay one more follow-up yeah so I didn't
 
01:24:40.250 --> 01:24:40.260 align:start position:0%
I guess I didn't hear that the problem
 
01:24:43.130 --> 01:24:43.140 align:start position:0%
was with LinkedIn specifically but I
 
01:24:45.470 --> 01:24:45.480 align:start position:0%
thought when we talked about this they
 
01:24:48.770 --> 01:24:48.780 align:start position:0%
both agreed that the senator Waters the
 
01:24:51.050 --> 01:24:51.060 align:start position:0%
original the original one that we heard
 
01:24:53.209 --> 01:24:53.219 align:start position:0%
was good they both agree that it made us
 
01:24:56.090 --> 01:24:56.100 align:start position:0%
stronger which uh I think
 
01:24:58.790 --> 01:24:58.800 align:start position:0%
that same language here somewhere
 
01:25:00.229 --> 01:25:00.239 align:start position:0%
um it made it stronger and then they
 
01:25:02.689 --> 01:25:02.699 align:start position:0%
said about that privacy part so I
 
01:25:03.950 --> 01:25:03.960 align:start position:0%
thought the recommendation coming out of
 
01:25:05.810 --> 01:25:05.820 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee was let's
 
01:25:09.050 --> 01:25:09.060 align:start position:0%
stay with that original language but the
 
01:25:10.910 --> 01:25:10.920 align:start position:0%
data privacy you had offered to work
 
01:25:14.390 --> 01:25:14.400 align:start position:0%
with Pam you know for for September or
 
01:25:16.370 --> 01:25:16.380 align:start position:0%
whenever to work on the data privacy but
 
01:25:19.130 --> 01:25:19.140 align:start position:0%
I never got the sense that LinkedIn was
 
01:25:20.750 --> 01:25:20.760 align:start position:0%
going out the window I thought we heard
 
01:25:22.910 --> 01:25:22.920 align:start position:0%
from both of them and even on committee
 
01:25:25.189 --> 01:25:25.199 align:start position:0%
that LinkedIn was really what this is
 
01:25:27.229 --> 01:25:27.239 align:start position:0%
all about I'm just gonna so that was how
 
01:25:29.689 --> 01:25:29.699 align:start position:0%
I walked out of this subcommittee okay
 
01:25:31.790 --> 01:25:31.800 align:start position:0%
well there were quite a few people who
 
01:25:33.649 --> 01:25:33.659 align:start position:0%
walked out differently which is how the
 
01:25:37.130 --> 01:25:37.140 align:start position:0%
Belcher amendment ended up coming to be
 
01:25:38.990 --> 01:25:39.000 align:start position:0%
because that was specifically against
 
01:25:42.470 --> 01:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
all social media
 
01:25:42.480 --> 01:25:43.550 align:start position:0%
all social media
okay

01:25:43.550 --> 01:25:43.560 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:25:45.709 --> 01:25:45.719 align:start position:0%
okay any further discard represent
 
01:25:47.810 --> 01:25:47.820 align:start position:0%
Cornell I I was under the impression
 
01:25:49.550 --> 01:25:49.560 align:start position:0%
that the whole point of this original
 
01:25:52.910 --> 01:25:52.920 align:start position:0%
bill being put in was because the ctes
 
01:25:56.750 --> 01:25:56.760 align:start position:0%
were having a problem not being able to
 
01:25:59.689 --> 01:25:59.699 align:start position:0%
the students to be able to show their
 
01:26:02.209 --> 01:26:02.219 align:start position:0%
skills that they've accomplished while
 
01:26:04.850 --> 01:26:04.860 align:start position:0%
they're in the CTE program and being
 
01:26:07.189 --> 01:26:07.199 align:start position:0%
able to carry it with them when they
 
01:26:09.950 --> 01:26:09.960 align:start position:0%
were out of the the program and they're
 
01:26:11.930 --> 01:26:11.940 align:start position:0%
going on to further either their
 
01:26:14.149 --> 01:26:14.159 align:start position:0%
education or apply for a job or whatever
 
01:26:17.810 --> 01:26:17.820 align:start position:0%
so if we take that out we're taking out
 
01:26:20.810 --> 01:26:20.820 align:start position:0%
the entire reason why this bill was
 
01:26:24.770 --> 01:26:24.780 align:start position:0%
proposed in the first place so the ctes
 
01:26:28.250 --> 01:26:28.260 align:start position:0%
were requesting that this information be
 
01:26:30.649 --> 01:26:30.659 align:start position:0%
allowed so that the students
 
01:26:32.689 --> 01:26:32.699 align:start position:0%
are getting credit for what they're
 
01:26:35.870 --> 01:26:35.880 align:start position:0%
accomplishing and their skills
 
01:26:38.149 --> 01:26:38.159 align:start position:0%
and that that reflects
 
01:26:40.129 --> 01:26:40.139 align:start position:0%
what I have in front of me here from Dr
 
01:26:40.139 --> 01:26:41.209 align:start position:0%
what I have in front of me here from Dr
Beard

01:26:41.209 --> 01:26:41.219 align:start position:0%
Beard
 
01:26:43.790 --> 01:26:43.800 align:start position:0%
from Jeff and he said I agree and if
 
01:26:47.629 --> 01:26:47.639 align:start position:0%
it's possible amending RSA 18966 would
 
01:26:50.149 --> 01:26:50.159 align:start position:0%
address the issue we've discussed of CTE
 
01:26:52.250 --> 01:26:52.260 align:start position:0%
teachers and students finding it
 
01:26:54.590 --> 01:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
difficult to access industry recognized
 
01:26:57.470 --> 01:26:57.480 align:start position:0%
credentials assessments and Industry
 
01:26:59.870 --> 01:26:59.880 align:start position:0%
standard tools such as Adobe Pro and
 
01:27:02.770 --> 01:27:02.780 align:start position:0%
SolidWorks in the CTE programs that's
 
01:27:05.510 --> 01:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
communication which we have and was Jeff
 
01:27:07.850 --> 01:27:07.860 align:start position:0%
beard you know as is he worked with you
 
01:27:09.470 --> 01:27:09.480 align:start position:0%
on this amendment
 
01:27:12.830 --> 01:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
that you know I you the one that I
 
01:27:15.110 --> 01:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
drafted last yesterday yes I sent it to
 
01:27:18.350 --> 01:27:18.360 align:start position:0%
Jeff he's reviewed it I didn't have a
 
01:27:20.030 --> 01:27:20.040 align:start position:0%
long conversation with him but he's
 
01:27:23.330 --> 01:27:23.340 align:start position:0%
aware of what what we drafted yes
 
01:27:25.729 --> 01:27:25.739 align:start position:0%
Rick yes
 
01:27:28.550 --> 01:27:28.560 align:start position:0%
um the CTE part of it was the waters
 
01:27:31.010 --> 01:27:31.020 align:start position:0%
Amendment which is what is in my
 
01:27:32.810 --> 01:27:32.820 align:start position:0%
Amendment it's the part that lets the
 
01:27:36.590 --> 01:27:36.600 align:start position:0%
CTE do all of those things with with all
 
01:27:38.209 --> 01:27:38.219 align:start position:0%
of those places where the kids are
 
01:27:39.770 --> 01:27:39.780 align:start position:0%
getting trained on like if they have
 
01:27:42.530 --> 01:27:42.540 align:start position:0%
training on Adobe they can do the they
 
01:27:45.229 --> 01:27:45.239 align:start position:0%
can use the platform they can take the
 
01:27:48.350 --> 01:27:48.360 align:start position:0%
test that is a permanent
 
01:27:51.770 --> 01:27:51.780 align:start position:0%
um badge that they have the badges that
 
01:27:53.510 --> 01:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
was one of the things we had discussed
 
01:27:55.629 --> 01:27:55.639 align:start position:0%
the badges in
 
01:27:58.790 --> 01:27:58.800 align:start position:0%
LinkedIn are not really recognized by
 
01:28:01.729 --> 01:28:01.739 align:start position:0%
industry this allows them to do the ones
 
01:28:04.850 --> 01:28:04.860 align:start position:0%
that the CTE was asking for
 
01:28:07.850 --> 01:28:07.860 align:start position:0%
um and so that's why that's all in there
 
01:28:09.470 --> 01:28:09.480 align:start position:0%
because that's what they came that's
 
01:28:10.790 --> 01:28:10.800 align:start position:0%
what they wanted
 
01:28:12.830 --> 01:28:12.840 align:start position:0%
I think they were specifically asking
 
01:28:15.169 --> 01:28:15.179 align:start position:0%
for LinkedIn because it follows them to
 
01:28:18.470 --> 01:28:18.480 align:start position:0%
their job afterwards when they apply for
 
01:28:22.189 --> 01:28:22.199 align:start position:0%
to say I've learned this skill so I I do
 
01:28:24.950 --> 01:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
think and going to the CTE advisory
 
01:28:28.550 --> 01:28:28.560 align:start position:0%
committee that I'm on I hear the CTE
 
01:28:30.169 --> 01:28:30.179 align:start position:0%
centers for the past two years
 
01:28:33.050 --> 01:28:33.060 align:start position:0%
complaining about this recent law that
 
01:28:35.689 --> 01:28:35.699 align:start position:0%
was put in that prevented them using
 
01:28:39.010 --> 01:28:39.020 align:start position:0%
this and it's keeping the students from
 
01:28:41.689 --> 01:28:41.699 align:start position:0%
using what their skills when they're
 
01:28:43.790 --> 01:28:43.800 align:start position:0%
going further on so this specifically
 
01:28:46.850 --> 01:28:46.860 align:start position:0%
was put in to do what it's now going to
 
01:28:48.770 --> 01:28:48.780 align:start position:0%
do with
 
01:28:52.430 --> 01:28:52.440 align:start position:0%
um attorney Fenton's Amendment and
 
01:28:55.729 --> 01:28:55.739 align:start position:0%
um Senator Waters original one and I
 
01:28:57.350 --> 01:28:57.360 align:start position:0%
think if you take out social media
 
01:28:59.629 --> 01:28:59.639 align:start position:0%
completely it doesn't do anything of
 
01:29:02.810 --> 01:29:02.820 align:start position:0%
what the ctes were asking for
 
01:29:04.550 --> 01:29:04.560 align:start position:0%
represent Belcher
 
01:29:06.110 --> 01:29:06.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair just to reiterate
 
01:29:07.250 --> 01:29:07.260 align:start position:0%
from the subcommittee some of the
 
01:29:10.070 --> 01:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
testimony that we did receive on uh this
 
01:29:13.070 --> 01:29:13.080 align:start position:0%
Bill yes this bill colloquial
 
01:29:15.590 --> 01:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
colloquially known as the LinkedIn bill
 
01:29:19.070 --> 01:29:19.080 align:start position:0%
was in fact designed to give students on
 
01:29:20.750 --> 01:29:20.760 align:start position:0%
to LinkedIn and other such social media
 
01:29:23.450 --> 01:29:23.460 align:start position:0%
sites for the objective of obtaining
 
01:29:26.270 --> 01:29:26.280 align:start position:0%
digital badges for job seeking and
 
01:29:29.149 --> 01:29:29.159 align:start position:0%
whatnot we also heard testimony that and
 
01:29:31.010 --> 01:29:31.020 align:start position:0%
in current law there is nothing
 
01:29:31.020 --> 01:29:32.510 align:start position:0%
in current law there is nothing
prohibiting

01:29:32.510 --> 01:29:32.520 align:start position:0%
prohibiting
 
01:29:36.770 --> 01:29:36.780 align:start position:0%
uh programs of study within ctes or
 
01:29:39.770 --> 01:29:39.780 align:start position:0%
schools from doing industry recognized
 
01:29:42.290 --> 01:29:42.300 align:start position:0%
standardized testing for things like
 
01:29:44.689 --> 01:29:44.699 align:start position:0%
Adobe the only thing they're looking to
 
01:29:46.850 --> 01:29:46.860 align:start position:0%
do is to get onto LinkedIn wherein you
 
01:29:49.729 --> 01:29:49.739 align:start position:0%
can take not industry recognized quizzes
 
01:29:53.950 --> 01:29:53.960 align:start position:0%
to obtain uh badges that show
 
01:29:56.390 --> 01:29:56.400 align:start position:0%
theoretically that you have some level
 
01:29:59.330 --> 01:29:59.340 align:start position:0%
of knowledge in a certain topic and this
 
01:30:01.010 --> 01:30:01.020 align:start position:0%
is used for job searching and whatnot
 
01:30:03.590 --> 01:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
and yes you're 100 correct I believe
 
01:30:05.810 --> 01:30:05.820 align:start position:0%
that is what CTE was trying to do was to
 
01:30:07.370 --> 01:30:07.380 align:start position:0%
get people on social media and Linkedin
 
01:30:09.770 --> 01:30:09.780 align:start position:0%
that is exactly why I crafted my
 
01:30:11.689 --> 01:30:11.699 align:start position:0%
Amendment because I think that is
 
01:30:14.629 --> 01:30:14.639 align:start position:0%
totally inappropriate for about a half
 
01:30:16.330 --> 01:30:16.340 align:start position:0%
dozen different reasons we heard
 
01:30:19.010 --> 01:30:19.020 align:start position:0%
testimony that this would subject
 
01:30:21.410 --> 01:30:21.420 align:start position:0%
students to the terms of service of
 
01:30:23.990 --> 01:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
third-party social media sites that
 
01:30:26.810 --> 01:30:26.820 align:start position:0%
means whatever whims they may have
 
01:30:29.030 --> 01:30:29.040 align:start position:0%
they are subject to those terms of
 
01:30:30.530 --> 01:30:30.540 align:start position:0%
service I specifically brought up ideas
 
01:30:33.470 --> 01:30:33.480 align:start position:0%
of the idea of hate speech if they have
 
01:30:36.350 --> 01:30:36.360 align:start position:0%
something they say that and kids say
 
01:30:36.360 --> 01:30:37.490 align:start position:0%
something they say that and kids say
stuff

01:30:37.490 --> 01:30:37.500 align:start position:0%
stuff
 
01:30:40.610 --> 01:30:40.620 align:start position:0%
the the testimony we received is they
 
01:30:43.070 --> 01:30:43.080 align:start position:0%
want teachers to be able to direct
 
01:30:45.290 --> 01:30:45.300 align:start position:0%
students on how to not violate hate
 
01:30:48.709 --> 01:30:48.719 align:start position:0%
speech regular rules in terms of service
 
01:30:50.270 --> 01:30:50.280 align:start position:0%
I don't think that's something we should
 
01:30:51.770 --> 01:30:51.780 align:start position:0%
be worrying about in school we have a
 
01:30:53.930 --> 01:30:53.940 align:start position:0%
constitution We're Not subjecting Kids
 
01:30:56.450 --> 01:30:56.460 align:start position:0%
to third-party terms of service we also
 
01:30:58.010 --> 01:30:58.020 align:start position:0%
heard that this opens up kids to
 
01:30:59.570 --> 01:30:59.580 align:start position:0%
potential Predators because we can't
 
01:31:01.970 --> 01:31:01.980 align:start position:0%
monitor the private
 
01:31:05.870 --> 01:31:05.880 align:start position:0%
um activity of uh private messages and
 
01:31:07.550 --> 01:31:07.560 align:start position:0%
there's also some data privacy issues
 
01:31:09.470 --> 01:31:09.480 align:start position:0%
when it comes to this so that is exactly
 
01:31:11.750 --> 01:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
why I put my amendment in place that
 
01:31:14.570 --> 01:31:14.580 align:start position:0%
would totally preclude not industry
 
01:31:17.110 --> 01:31:17.120 align:start position:0%
recognized standards not CTE anything
 
01:31:20.390 --> 01:31:20.400 align:start position:0%
just the use of social media
 
01:31:23.990 --> 01:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
isn't your your train of thought here
 
01:31:26.770 --> 01:31:26.780 align:start position:0%
overriding the authority of a parent
 
01:31:30.290 --> 01:31:30.300 align:start position:0%
you know this says with written parental
 
01:31:30.300 --> 01:31:31.790 align:start position:0%
you know this says with written parental
consent

01:31:31.790 --> 01:31:31.800 align:start position:0%
consent
 
01:31:34.669 --> 01:31:34.679 align:start position:0%
and from the school district side it's
 
01:31:37.370 --> 01:31:37.380 align:start position:0%
an approved program of studies so you
 
01:31:39.530 --> 01:31:39.540 align:start position:0%
have both the school districts saying
 
01:31:41.870 --> 01:31:41.880 align:start position:0%
this is what's going to be done with
 
01:31:43.850 --> 01:31:43.860 align:start position:0%
this program and you have the parents
 
01:31:47.629 --> 01:31:47.639 align:start position:0%
saying you Johnny Hess or Susan has my
 
01:31:51.229 --> 01:31:51.239 align:start position:0%
you know consent to pursue this using
 
01:31:54.290 --> 01:31:54.300 align:start position:0%
this technology platform so I think that
 
01:31:55.970 --> 01:31:55.980 align:start position:0%
what we've done through the amending
 
01:31:57.830 --> 01:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
language that the attorneys both of them
 
01:32:00.110 --> 01:32:00.120 align:start position:0%
have put together here for us I think it
 
01:32:01.610 --> 01:32:01.620 align:start position:0%
captures everything that we need to
 
01:32:01.620 --> 01:32:02.629 align:start position:0%
captures everything that we need to
capture

01:32:02.629 --> 01:32:02.639 align:start position:0%
capture
 
01:32:05.209 --> 01:32:05.219 align:start position:0%
if I may just respond to that
 
01:32:06.649 --> 01:32:06.659 align:start position:0%
um we also heard testimony and I would
 
01:32:08.450 --> 01:32:08.460 align:start position:0%
agree there is nothing prohibiting
 
01:32:11.050 --> 01:32:11.060 align:start position:0%
students if they want to from from
 
01:32:15.470 --> 01:32:15.480 align:start position:0%
obtaining these social media platform
 
01:32:18.169 --> 01:32:18.179 align:start position:0%
um credentials and accounts on their own
 
01:32:19.669 --> 01:32:19.679 align:start position:0%
outside of school you don't have to do
 
01:32:20.930 --> 01:32:20.940 align:start position:0%
this through a school curriculum all you
 
01:32:22.370 --> 01:32:22.380 align:start position:0%
have to do is sit down and take a quiz
 
01:32:24.169 --> 01:32:24.179 align:start position:0%
on your computer and you earn the
 
01:32:26.330 --> 01:32:26.340 align:start position:0%
digital badge so if a student has
 
01:32:28.910 --> 01:32:28.920 align:start position:0%
received the requisite training in a in
 
01:32:31.310 --> 01:32:31.320 align:start position:0%
a school curriculum to do that they can
 
01:32:36.590 --> 01:32:36.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:38.990 --> 01:32:39.000 align:start position:0%
but this also has language within that
 
01:32:42.950 --> 01:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
bill which is saying as used as part of
 
01:32:45.709 --> 01:32:45.719 align:start position:0%
the students so so if they're at school
 
01:32:47.750 --> 01:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
they can do this it's part of their
 
01:32:50.450 --> 01:32:50.460 align:start position:0%
approved program with parental consent I
 
01:32:54.290 --> 01:32:54.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:57.169 --> 01:32:57.179 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
01:33:00.530 --> 01:33:00.540 align:start position:0%
okay uh anything else on on this bill
 
01:33:03.590 --> 01:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
yeah Rick Rick I think um I heard you
 
01:33:06.169 --> 01:33:06.179 align:start position:0%
say that that you have an amendment that
 
01:33:08.810 --> 01:33:08.820 align:start position:0%
preserves section one and then create
 
01:33:11.090 --> 01:33:11.100 align:start position:0%
second takes the attorneys and plugs
 
01:33:13.250 --> 01:33:13.260 align:start position:0%
that in in section two that's coming
 
01:33:15.110 --> 01:33:15.120 align:start position:0%
into it somewhere along the way right
 
01:33:17.930 --> 01:33:17.940 align:start position:0%
right and that would be Roman 5f per the
 
01:33:20.510 --> 01:33:20.520 align:start position:0%
language that you had in your your
 
01:33:22.790 --> 01:33:22.800 align:start position:0%
um the draft that you put together with
 
01:33:25.970 --> 01:33:25.980 align:start position:0%
Diana and that that came from and it had
 
01:33:28.189 --> 01:33:28.199 align:start position:0%
the word Diana approved program yes yes
 
01:33:31.570 --> 01:33:31.580 align:start position:0%
all right correct yeah yeah
 
01:33:34.209 --> 01:33:34.219 align:start position:0%
representative yeah no so we've heard
 
01:33:36.830 --> 01:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
from perhaps they're like us we've heard
 
01:33:38.330 --> 01:33:38.340 align:start position:0%
from representative Belcher on their
 
01:33:40.490 --> 01:33:40.500 align:start position:0%
amendments we have not heard from
 
01:33:43.669 --> 01:33:43.679 align:start position:0%
represent McDonald who also has an
 
01:33:47.510 --> 01:33:47.520 align:start position:0%
amendment here so I to complete the the
 
01:33:51.169 --> 01:33:51.179 align:start position:0%
look okay representative McDonald and
 
01:33:53.689 --> 01:33:53.699 align:start position:0%
speak to her Amendment on this too thank
 
01:33:58.010 --> 01:33:58.020 align:start position:0%
you okay go for it thank you I'd like to
 
01:33:59.090 --> 01:33:59.100 align:start position:0%
say that the discussion we've been
 
01:34:01.070 --> 01:34:01.080 align:start position:0%
having about the amending language that
 
01:34:03.410 --> 01:34:03.420 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman worked with attorney
 
01:34:06.110 --> 01:34:06.120 align:start position:0%
fending on I think it's important to add
 
01:34:08.570 --> 01:34:08.580 align:start position:0%
a proof program of study because that's
 
01:34:10.790 --> 01:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
saying that the program itself is
 
01:34:12.770 --> 01:34:12.780 align:start position:0%
approved by the school but what my
 
01:34:15.530 --> 01:34:15.540 align:start position:0%
Amendment would address is how the
 
01:34:17.629 --> 01:34:17.639 align:start position:0%
social media platform would be used
 
01:34:19.490 --> 01:34:19.500 align:start position:0%
because like it has been mentioned
 
01:34:21.229 --> 01:34:21.239 align:start position:0%
there's data privacy concerns with
 
01:34:23.629 --> 01:34:23.639 align:start position:0%
third-party contracts the school board
 
01:34:25.430 --> 01:34:25.440 align:start position:0%
or the school administration would not
 
01:34:27.470 --> 01:34:27.480 align:start position:0%
have any control of these third-party
 
01:34:29.570 --> 01:34:29.580 align:start position:0%
contracts but they can in their school
 
01:34:31.729 --> 01:34:31.739 align:start position:0%
say how these platforms should be used
 
01:34:34.070 --> 01:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
so my Amendment would address the safety
 
01:34:35.629 --> 01:34:35.639 align:start position:0%
concerns as it was mentioned there's
 
01:34:37.610 --> 01:34:37.620 align:start position:0%
some predators online and it would just
 
01:34:39.590 --> 01:34:39.600 align:start position:0%
say that these will not be a part of a
 
01:34:41.689 --> 01:34:41.699 align:start position:0%
school account but it does not prevent a
 
01:34:43.490 --> 01:34:43.500 align:start position:0%
student in any personal account from
 
01:34:45.229 --> 01:34:45.239 align:start position:0%
interacting with these people so they
 
01:34:46.850 --> 01:34:46.860 align:start position:0%
should choose but just recognize the
 
01:34:48.649 --> 01:34:48.659 align:start position:0%
school's not the place for a kind of a
 
01:34:51.050 --> 01:34:51.060 align:start position:0%
safety infraction
 
01:34:53.750 --> 01:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
thank you any comments regarding
 
01:34:56.930 --> 01:34:56.940 align:start position:0%
representative McDonald's Amendment
 
01:35:00.290 --> 01:35:00.300 align:start position:0%
represent cascadden no but along that
 
01:35:00.300 --> 01:35:01.629 align:start position:0%
represent cascadden no but along that
line

01:35:01.629 --> 01:35:01.639 align:start position:0%
line
 
01:35:04.850 --> 01:35:04.860 align:start position:0%
my question is based on the data
 
01:35:07.970 --> 01:35:07.980 align:start position:0%
governance plans and the tech directors
 
01:35:10.310 --> 01:35:10.320 align:start position:0%
so maybe representative Paul can answer
 
01:35:13.910 --> 01:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
this I understand that that Tech
 
01:35:16.669 --> 01:35:16.679 align:start position:0%
director can allow
 
01:35:18.590 --> 01:35:18.600 align:start position:0%
because they take an inventory of every
 
01:35:22.129 --> 01:35:22.139 align:start position:0%
all the apps that they can either allow
 
01:35:25.310 --> 01:35:25.320 align:start position:0%
access to certain apps or deny access to
 
01:35:26.629 --> 01:35:26.639 align:start position:0%
certain apps
 
01:35:30.169 --> 01:35:30.179 align:start position:0%
and so they watch that very carefully
 
01:35:33.290 --> 01:35:33.300 align:start position:0%
so if it's Adobe then they would allow
 
01:35:36.590 --> 01:35:36.600 align:start position:0%
access and if it's not Adobe then they
 
01:35:38.810 --> 01:35:38.820 align:start position:0%
don't have access that's my
 
01:35:38.820 --> 01:35:40.610 align:start position:0%
don't have access that's my
understanding

01:35:40.610 --> 01:35:40.620 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
01:35:42.709 --> 01:35:42.719 align:start position:0%
um that that's the job of the tech
 
01:35:45.229 --> 01:35:45.239 align:start position:0%
people and there's a filtering system in
 
01:35:45.239 --> 01:35:46.189 align:start position:0%
people and there's a filtering system in
place

01:35:46.189 --> 01:35:46.199 align:start position:0%
place
 
01:35:48.370 --> 01:35:48.380 align:start position:0%
to either
 
01:35:51.410 --> 01:35:51.420 align:start position:0%
administratively allow certain platforms
 
01:35:54.830 --> 01:35:54.840 align:start position:0%
and am I is that how it works
 
01:35:57.729 --> 01:35:57.739 align:start position:0%
go ahead that is correct and I actually
 
01:36:00.950 --> 01:36:00.960 align:start position:0%
contacted our Tech director involved and
 
01:36:03.649 --> 01:36:03.659 align:start position:0%
with this the original Waters
 
01:36:05.990 --> 01:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
um and he said that's fine as long as
 
01:36:08.090 --> 01:36:08.100 align:start position:0%
the parental consent part was the only
 
01:36:10.669 --> 01:36:10.679 align:start position:0%
piece that he was you know saying it was
 
01:36:12.290 --> 01:36:12.300 align:start position:0%
absolutely mandatory to be in there but
 
01:36:15.110 --> 01:36:15.120 align:start position:0%
clearly we there they definitely go
 
01:36:16.910 --> 01:36:16.920 align:start position:0%
through the list and make sure nobody's
 
01:36:18.229 --> 01:36:18.239 align:start position:0%
doing what they shouldn't be doing they
 
01:36:20.570 --> 01:36:20.580 align:start position:0%
shut things down Adobe is I have to say
 
01:36:22.550 --> 01:36:22.560 align:start position:0%
has not ever been an issue I did Adobe
 
01:36:24.350 --> 01:36:24.360 align:start position:0%
all this week in Middle with middle
 
01:36:24.360 --> 01:36:25.850 align:start position:0%
all this week in Middle with middle
schoolers

01:36:25.850 --> 01:36:25.860 align:start position:0%
schoolers
 
01:36:28.910 --> 01:36:28.920 align:start position:0%
um but going back to this LinkedIn this
 
01:36:30.830 --> 01:36:30.840 align:start position:0%
is about LinkedIn
 
01:36:34.310 --> 01:36:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:36.410 --> 01:36:36.420 align:start position:0%
a reference McDonald your your
 
01:36:38.870 --> 01:36:38.880 align:start position:0%
amendments represent referencing 189
 
01:36:41.930 --> 01:36:41.940 align:start position:0%
colon 70.
 
01:36:45.530 --> 01:36:45.540 align:start position:0%
and doesn't mention anything about uh
 
01:36:48.709 --> 01:36:48.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:48.719 --> 01:36:50.030 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:36:50.030 --> 01:36:50.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:53.149 --> 01:36:53.159 align:start position:0%
is it your intent that parental consent
 
01:36:56.990 --> 01:36:57.000 align:start position:0%
belongs in there somewhere or or should
 
01:37:00.830 --> 01:37:00.840 align:start position:0%
it be referencing 189 60 colon 66 not
 
01:37:00.840 --> 01:37:02.930 align:start position:0%
it be referencing 189 60 colon 66 not
70.

01:37:02.930 --> 01:37:02.940 align:start position:0%
70.
 
01:37:04.370 --> 01:37:04.380 align:start position:0%
um and then I also have the question
 
01:37:07.129 --> 01:37:07.139 align:start position:0%
what is an influencer
 
01:37:10.970 --> 01:37:10.980 align:start position:0%
okay yes my Amendment does have the in
 
01:37:13.010 --> 01:37:13.020 align:start position:0%
the intention of my amendment is for
 
01:37:14.990 --> 01:37:15.000 align:start position:0%
parental consent whether that be coupled
 
01:37:16.910 --> 01:37:16.920 align:start position:0%
with something else
 
01:37:16.920 --> 01:37:17.629 align:start position:0%
with something else
um

01:37:17.629 --> 01:37:17.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:20.330 --> 01:37:20.340 align:start position:0%
as for the placement of it in the rsas I
 
01:37:23.030 --> 01:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
added a sentence to the original Bill my
 
01:37:24.709 --> 01:37:24.719 align:start position:0%
Amendment arose prior to these
 
01:37:27.110 --> 01:37:27.120 align:start position:0%
subsequent amendments so if it is felt
 
01:37:28.729 --> 01:37:28.739 align:start position:0%
by the committee is better placed in a
 
01:37:30.950 --> 01:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
different RSA then that's totally all
 
01:37:33.709 --> 01:37:33.719 align:start position:0%
right as well and as for an influencer
 
01:37:36.229 --> 01:37:36.239 align:start position:0%
that would be someone using social media
 
01:37:38.450 --> 01:37:38.460 align:start position:0%
for the point of making a career of
 
01:37:40.729 --> 01:37:40.739 align:start position:0%
social media when the intent of CTE is
 
01:37:42.590 --> 01:37:42.600 align:start position:0%
to develop careers in Industry
 
01:37:44.570 --> 01:37:44.580 align:start position:0%
recognized credentials and social media
 
01:37:46.370 --> 01:37:46.380 align:start position:0%
as a career itself
 
01:37:50.050 --> 01:37:50.060 align:start position:0%
as opposed to not being used
 
01:37:52.729 --> 01:37:52.739 align:start position:0%
as it should be as a tool to help
 
01:37:54.770 --> 01:37:54.780 align:start position:0%
someone's career as opposed to social
 
01:37:56.750 --> 01:37:56.760 align:start position:0%
media is the career and I think that's
 
01:37:58.669 --> 01:37:58.679 align:start position:0%
really not the intent of the bill but as
 
01:38:01.310 --> 01:38:01.320 align:start position:0%
worded the bill itself has nothing to
 
01:38:03.350 --> 01:38:03.360 align:start position:0%
prevent something like that from arising
 
01:38:05.629 --> 01:38:05.639 align:start position:0%
which there's obvious safety concerns
 
01:38:09.229 --> 01:38:09.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:11.149 --> 01:38:11.159 align:start position:0%
representative Hall thank you
 
01:38:13.010 --> 01:38:13.020 align:start position:0%
representative McDonald I'm just curious
 
01:38:16.189 --> 01:38:16.199 align:start position:0%
does adding the approved program of
 
01:38:18.649 --> 01:38:18.659 align:start position:0%
study does that fix the problem with
 
01:38:20.750 --> 01:38:20.760 align:start position:0%
social media influencers since that's
 
01:38:22.189 --> 01:38:22.199 align:start position:0%
probably not in the program of study
 
01:38:24.110 --> 01:38:24.120 align:start position:0%
would that kind of take care of that
 
01:38:26.510 --> 01:38:26.520 align:start position:0%
again I do think that's a step in the
 
01:38:28.430 --> 01:38:28.440 align:start position:0%
right direction and I am supportive of
 
01:38:30.110 --> 01:38:30.120 align:start position:0%
that amending language and addition
 
01:38:32.990 --> 01:38:33.000 align:start position:0%
because like I said that would have a
 
01:38:35.930 --> 01:38:35.940 align:start position:0%
lot to do since we cannot prevent social
 
01:38:38.270 --> 01:38:38.280 align:start position:0%
media platforms third-party contracts
 
01:38:40.010 --> 01:38:40.020 align:start position:0%
and how their terms of service operate
 
01:38:42.350 --> 01:38:42.360 align:start position:0%
my Amendment just aims to be the
 
01:38:44.149 --> 01:38:44.159 align:start position:0%
school's oversight of students and how
 
01:38:46.189 --> 01:38:46.199 align:start position:0%
students use the platform so I still
 
01:38:51.649 --> 01:38:51.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:55.850 --> 01:38:55.860 align:start position:0%
it's a simple question on on the program
 
01:38:58.310 --> 01:38:58.320 align:start position:0%
the information that attorneys Fenton
 
01:39:00.350 --> 01:39:00.360 align:start position:0%
provided at least that you passed out
 
01:39:02.930 --> 01:39:02.940 align:start position:0%
two minutes ago is um Rick is there a
 
01:39:05.030 --> 01:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
specific amendment number attached to
 
01:39:08.030 --> 01:39:08.040 align:start position:0%
this or this there will be they're doing
 
01:39:10.070 --> 01:39:10.080 align:start position:0%
it right but they're speaking could be
 
01:39:12.290 --> 01:39:12.300 align:start position:0%
the same thing they have the exactly
 
01:39:14.169 --> 01:39:14.179 align:start position:0%
this the same sheet
 
01:39:16.390 --> 01:39:16.400 align:start position:0%
they're going to give us two book
 
01:39:20.810 --> 01:39:20.820 align:start position:0%
amendments one without section one
 
01:39:23.649 --> 01:39:23.659 align:start position:0%
and that piece you have there
 
01:39:26.390 --> 01:39:26.400 align:start position:0%
over that piece and the other one is
 
01:39:28.970 --> 01:39:28.980 align:start position:0%
with section one and that is section two
 
01:39:33.050 --> 01:39:33.060 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
01:39:35.149 --> 01:39:35.159 align:start position:0%
can we do yet another amendment that
 
01:39:39.590 --> 01:39:39.600 align:start position:0%
adds her language to section one
 
01:39:46.870 --> 01:39:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:51.470 --> 01:39:51.480 align:start position:0%
I I I would say that their needs and ask
 
01:39:53.390 --> 01:39:53.400 align:start position:0%
the attorney there
 
01:39:55.430 --> 01:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
um we heard one definition of
 
01:39:55.440 --> 01:39:57.110 align:start position:0%
um we heard one definition of
influencers

01:39:57.110 --> 01:39:57.120 align:start position:0%
influencers
 
01:40:00.950 --> 01:40:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:02.870 --> 01:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
she's a lot younger than me so I'm going
 
01:40:04.669 --> 01:40:04.679 align:start position:0%
to go with her definition
 
01:40:09.110 --> 01:40:09.120 align:start position:0%
um very good I'm not gonna try to one-up
 
01:40:12.590 --> 01:40:12.600 align:start position:0%
that um I I do I I don't know if it's
 
01:40:15.290 --> 01:40:15.300 align:start position:0%
it's necessary because of the way it's
 
01:40:17.570 --> 01:40:17.580 align:start position:0%
structured and I'm interested in your
 
01:40:19.970 --> 01:40:19.980 align:start position:0%
thoughts on this but if you put it into
 
01:40:24.169 --> 01:40:24.179 align:start position:0%
the way it is now in 189.66 and it's in
 
01:40:25.850 --> 01:40:25.860 align:start position:0%
the approved
 
01:40:28.310 --> 01:40:28.320 align:start position:0%
um program that's submitted to the state
 
01:40:30.050 --> 01:40:30.060 align:start position:0%
board or the not the State Board the
 
01:40:32.390 --> 01:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
school board on an annual basis and
 
01:40:34.430 --> 01:40:34.440 align:start position:0%
that's what's provided for
 
01:40:37.010 --> 01:40:37.020 align:start position:0%
in the law and then it has to be part of
 
01:40:38.930 --> 01:40:38.940 align:start position:0%
an approved program of study I wonder if
 
01:40:38.940 --> 01:40:39.729 align:start position:0%
an approved program of study I wonder if
that

01:40:39.729 --> 01:40:39.739 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:40:41.990 --> 01:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
addresses your concern because I
 
01:40:43.729 --> 01:40:43.739 align:start position:0%
understand your concern
 
01:40:45.649 --> 01:40:45.659 align:start position:0%
um and and I think you're right it's a
 
01:40:47.629 --> 01:40:47.639 align:start position:0%
good idea to to include it but I think
 
01:40:49.790 --> 01:40:49.800 align:start position:0%
there's a couple layers of protection
 
01:40:52.729 --> 01:40:52.739 align:start position:0%
there that's just how I look at it and
 
01:40:55.430 --> 01:40:55.440 align:start position:0%
again I'm going to defer to you
 
01:41:00.470 --> 01:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:02.450 --> 01:41:02.460 align:start position:0%
um I appreciate you saying that and for
 
01:41:05.030 --> 01:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
your work in drafting this amendment
 
01:41:05.040 --> 01:41:06.050 align:start position:0%
your work in drafting this amendment
um

01:41:06.050 --> 01:41:06.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:08.390 --> 01:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
in terms of my Amendment it's my first
 
01:41:09.709 --> 01:41:09.719 align:start position:0%
time making an amendment if the
 
01:41:11.810 --> 01:41:11.820 align:start position:0%
definitions are unclear I think we have
 
01:41:13.970 --> 01:41:13.980 align:start position:0%
talked about combining amendments anyway
 
01:41:15.950 --> 01:41:15.960 align:start position:0%
so we can clarify the language if that's
 
01:41:19.070 --> 01:41:19.080 align:start position:0%
the issue I still do think there is some
 
01:41:19.080 --> 01:41:20.649 align:start position:0%
the issue I still do think there is some
necessary

01:41:20.649 --> 01:41:20.659 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
01:41:23.330 --> 01:41:23.340 align:start position:0%
component to this that is missing if my
 
01:41:25.070 --> 01:41:25.080 align:start position:0%
amendment is not addressed the safety
 
01:41:27.290 --> 01:41:27.300 align:start position:0%
concerns I think adding this as approved
 
01:41:29.149 --> 01:41:29.159 align:start position:0%
program of study is very important yes
 
01:41:31.610 --> 01:41:31.620 align:start position:0%
do that but in addition
 
01:41:33.590 --> 01:41:33.600 align:start position:0%
we really there is nothing as the
 
01:41:35.270 --> 01:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
amendment is written that would prevent
 
01:41:37.669 --> 01:41:37.679 align:start position:0%
uses of other social media platforms the
 
01:41:39.050 --> 01:41:39.060 align:start position:0%
intention is LinkedIn it was
 
01:41:41.090 --> 01:41:41.100 align:start position:0%
colloquially referred to as the LinkedIn
 
01:41:43.850 --> 01:41:43.860 align:start position:0%
Amendment but there are numerous social
 
01:41:46.010 --> 01:41:46.020 align:start position:0%
media platforms that theoretically could
 
01:41:48.070 --> 01:41:48.080 align:start position:0%
be involved and I just want a standard
 
01:41:50.750 --> 01:41:50.760 align:start position:0%
to be recognized in this build that
 
01:41:52.790 --> 01:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
would prevent other social media
 
01:42:02.770 --> 01:42:02.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:05.750 --> 01:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
I I just assumed that with the the
 
01:42:08.209 --> 01:42:08.219 align:start position:0%
safeguards of the I.T in schools that
 
01:42:10.250 --> 01:42:10.260 align:start position:0%
the other social media platforms are
 
01:42:11.990 --> 01:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
already blocked
 
01:42:13.790 --> 01:42:13.800 align:start position:0%
um I don't think unless I'm wrong
 
01:42:13.800 --> 01:42:16.070 align:start position:0%
um I don't think unless I'm wrong
representative

01:42:16.070 --> 01:42:16.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:42:18.649 --> 01:42:18.659 align:start position:0%
um I I don't think they can get on them
 
01:42:21.229 --> 01:42:21.239 align:start position:0%
well I I think even though we call this
 
01:42:23.689 --> 01:42:23.699 align:start position:0%
a LinkedIn bill it doesn't mean it's
 
01:42:26.270 --> 01:42:26.280 align:start position:0%
only LinkedIn I mean I think again we're
 
01:42:28.010 --> 01:42:28.020 align:start position:0%
talking about approved program of study
 
01:42:31.550 --> 01:42:31.560 align:start position:0%
approved uh platforms so it could be
 
01:42:34.790 --> 01:42:34.800 align:start position:0%
well beyond LinkedIn but they need to be
 
01:42:36.590 --> 01:42:36.600 align:start position:0%
approved platforms
 
01:42:39.470 --> 01:42:39.480 align:start position:0%
and I don't think Claudia Conway as an
 
01:42:41.870 --> 01:42:41.880 align:start position:0%
influencer is going to make it here I
 
01:42:43.790 --> 01:42:43.800 align:start position:0%
don't think she's going to be in that
 
01:42:45.050 --> 01:42:45.060 align:start position:0%
career is going to be an approval
 
01:42:47.950 --> 01:42:47.960 align:start position:0%
program of study so I don't know
 
01:42:52.850 --> 01:42:52.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:54.649 --> 01:42:54.659 align:start position:0%
would it be wise than represent a hall
 
01:42:56.870 --> 01:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
that in the
 
01:43:00.290 --> 01:43:00.300 align:start position:0%
Amendment here from the attorneys that
 
01:43:03.290 --> 01:43:03.300 align:start position:0%
we we say that
 
01:43:05.930 --> 01:43:05.940 align:start position:0%
register for Approved technology
 
01:43:08.209 --> 01:43:08.219 align:start position:0%
platforms and services to be used as
 
01:43:10.189 --> 01:43:10.199 align:start position:0%
part of the students approves program of
 
01:43:10.199 --> 01:43:11.270 align:start position:0%
part of the students approves program of
study

01:43:11.270 --> 01:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
study
 
01:43:14.030 --> 01:43:14.040 align:start position:0%
we put the word approved in in front of
 
01:43:14.040 --> 01:43:18.410 align:start position:0%
we put the word approved in in front of
Technology

01:43:18.410 --> 01:43:18.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:20.510 --> 01:43:20.520 align:start position:0%
so that would give another layer of
 
01:43:23.209 --> 01:43:23.219 align:start position:0%
acceptance by the
 
01:43:25.850 --> 01:43:25.860 align:start position:0%
the program and maybe deal with some of
 
01:43:30.290 --> 01:43:30.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:33.649 --> 01:43:33.659 align:start position:0%
yes I I I I I it may be duplicative I
 
01:43:35.090 --> 01:43:35.100 align:start position:0%
know it but
 
01:43:35.100 --> 01:43:39.649 align:start position:0%
know it but
um

01:43:39.649 --> 01:43:39.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:42.709 --> 01:43:42.719 align:start position:0%
represent that Damon
 
01:43:44.570 --> 01:43:44.580 align:start position:0%
so I think that's actually a good ad
 
01:43:46.430 --> 01:43:46.440 align:start position:0%
because I don't read that as the same
 
01:43:48.649 --> 01:43:48.659 align:start position:0%
thing approved technology platforms
 
01:43:51.109 --> 01:43:51.119 align:start position:0%
versus approve program of study
 
01:43:52.910 --> 01:43:52.920 align:start position:0%
those are two different things I think
 
01:43:55.310 --> 01:43:55.320 align:start position:0%
we could put approved in there twice
 
01:43:58.189 --> 01:43:58.199 align:start position:0%
and I also if I can separate Point go
 
01:43:58.199 --> 01:43:58.970 align:start position:0%
and I also if I can separate Point go
ahead

01:43:58.970 --> 01:43:58.980 align:start position:0%
ahead
 
01:44:01.430 --> 01:44:01.440 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead
 
01:44:03.709 --> 01:44:03.719 align:start position:0%
it's important to look at this in the
 
01:44:05.870 --> 01:44:05.880 align:start position:0%
broader context of a changing landscape
 
01:44:07.129 --> 01:44:07.139 align:start position:0%
so we're
 
01:44:08.810 --> 01:44:08.820 align:start position:0%
colloquially calling it The LinkedIn
 
01:44:11.450 --> 01:44:11.460 align:start position:0%
bill but you know tomorrow or next year
 
01:44:13.970 --> 01:44:13.980 align:start position:0%
or whenever from now there'll be other
 
01:44:16.850 --> 01:44:16.860 align:start position:0%
platforms other social media
 
01:44:19.129 --> 01:44:19.139 align:start position:0%
so we shouldn't be looking at it only
 
01:44:19.139 --> 01:44:20.209 align:start position:0%
so we shouldn't be looking at it only
through

01:44:20.209 --> 01:44:20.219 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:44:23.689 --> 01:44:23.699 align:start position:0%
the lens or concern of LinkedIn
 
01:44:26.209 --> 01:44:26.219 align:start position:0%
okay further discussion we've got to
 
01:44:28.609 --> 01:44:28.619 align:start position:0%
move on here I think we've maybe we're
 
01:44:31.430 --> 01:44:31.440 align:start position:0%
closing in on it
 
01:44:33.890 --> 01:44:33.900 align:start position:0%
thank you very much that's the Wonder
 
01:44:35.629 --> 01:44:35.639 align:start position:0%
just very quickly and I agree with
 
01:44:37.550 --> 01:44:37.560 align:start position:0%
representative Damon it's so hard to
 
01:44:39.830 --> 01:44:39.840 align:start position:0%
legislate technology that is constantly
 
01:44:39.840 --> 01:44:41.030 align:start position:0%
legislate technology that is constantly
changing

01:44:41.030 --> 01:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
changing
 
01:44:41.040 --> 01:44:42.229 align:start position:0%
changing
um

01:44:42.229 --> 01:44:42.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:44.149 --> 01:44:44.159 align:start position:0%
but I wonder
 
01:44:46.910 --> 01:44:46.920 align:start position:0%
if the concern is perhaps addressed if
 
01:44:50.810 --> 01:44:50.820 align:start position:0%
you look at 189 66 Roman numeral five in
 
01:44:52.850 --> 01:44:52.860 align:start position:0%
its entirety look at those enumerated
 
01:44:55.189 --> 01:44:55.199 align:start position:0%
Provisions we're all focused on F
 
01:44:56.810 --> 01:44:56.820 align:start position:0%
because that's what we've drafted and
 
01:44:58.490 --> 01:44:58.500 align:start position:0%
that is the amendment but if you look at
 
01:45:01.310 --> 01:45:01.320 align:start position:0%
a through e where they talk about an
 
01:45:03.050 --> 01:45:03.060 align:start position:0%
inventory of of the software
 
01:45:05.629 --> 01:45:05.639 align:start position:0%
applications and the digital tools is it
 
01:45:08.570 --> 01:45:08.580 align:start position:0%
addressed or can one of those
 
01:45:10.970 --> 01:45:10.980 align:start position:0%
pieces that's already enumerated can
 
01:45:13.010 --> 01:45:13.020 align:start position:0%
this committee add to that
 
01:45:15.290 --> 01:45:15.300 align:start position:0%
just to add in that platform if that
 
01:45:17.930 --> 01:45:17.940 align:start position:0%
makes sense I think what I'm hearing is
 
01:45:20.030 --> 01:45:20.040 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of language that's agreed
 
01:45:22.550 --> 01:45:22.560 align:start position:0%
to there are very little areas that are
 
01:45:23.810 --> 01:45:23.820 align:start position:0%
not agreed to
 
01:45:25.550 --> 01:45:25.560 align:start position:0%
might be worth taking a highlighter and
 
01:45:27.290 --> 01:45:27.300 align:start position:0%
a highlighting the parts that we all
 
01:45:29.689 --> 01:45:29.699 align:start position:0%
agree to we I'm not a member of this
 
01:45:31.250 --> 01:45:31.260 align:start position:0%
committee but
 
01:45:33.010 --> 01:45:33.020 align:start position:0%
um this week
 
01:45:34.750 --> 01:45:34.760 align:start position:0%
this week
 
01:45:37.490 --> 01:45:37.500 align:start position:0%
this week this group
 
01:45:39.350 --> 01:45:39.360 align:start position:0%
um and identifying what is already
 
01:45:40.850 --> 01:45:40.860 align:start position:0%
agreed to because there's a lot of
 
01:45:45.050 --> 01:45:45.060 align:start position:0%
consensus I think the disagreements are
 
01:45:46.729 --> 01:45:46.739 align:start position:0%
pretty minor
 
01:45:48.229 --> 01:45:48.239 align:start position:0%
um but I think if you look I would
 
01:45:49.550 --> 01:45:49.560 align:start position:0%
encourage this committee to look at
 
01:45:51.649 --> 01:45:51.659 align:start position:0%
what's already enumerated it might
 
01:45:54.350 --> 01:45:54.360 align:start position:0%
already be encompassed in there and
 
01:45:56.810 --> 01:45:56.820 align:start position:0%
perhaps that could be added to if you
 
01:45:58.970 --> 01:45:58.980 align:start position:0%
feel that it's not sufficient
 
01:46:02.090 --> 01:46:02.100 align:start position:0%
and looking at Item B here within that
 
01:46:04.970 --> 01:46:04.980 align:start position:0%
laundry list a through f
 
01:46:06.770 --> 01:46:06.780 align:start position:0%
um B has
 
01:46:10.910 --> 01:46:10.920 align:start position:0%
a standards set by the department
 
01:46:14.090 --> 01:46:14.100 align:start position:0%
that must mean Doe
 
01:46:14.100 --> 01:46:15.109 align:start position:0%
that must mean Doe
yes

01:46:15.109 --> 01:46:15.119 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:46:17.870 --> 01:46:17.880 align:start position:0%
and does the department have standards
 
01:46:19.970 --> 01:46:19.980 align:start position:0%
for the software application digital
 
01:46:22.790 --> 01:46:22.800 align:start position:0%
tools and extensions
 
01:46:25.310 --> 01:46:25.320 align:start position:0%
I don't have that list yeah off the top
 
01:46:26.810 --> 01:46:26.820 align:start position:0%
of my head but I would assume that we do
 
01:46:29.510 --> 01:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
that we have it
 
01:46:31.310 --> 01:46:31.320 align:start position:0%
so then what we're talking about being
 
01:46:34.189 --> 01:46:34.199 align:start position:0%
an approved technology platform may
 
01:46:37.550 --> 01:46:37.560 align:start position:0%
already been done by the department
 
01:46:39.290 --> 01:46:39.300 align:start position:0%
I can look into seeing if we have that
 
01:46:41.629 --> 01:46:41.639 align:start position:0%
list but I think when you look at that
 
01:46:45.229 --> 01:46:45.239 align:start position:0%
section you can't just look at it as F I
 
01:46:47.209 --> 01:46:47.219 align:start position:0%
think you have to look at it in totality
 
01:46:49.910 --> 01:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
yes because that is it's part of a
 
01:46:52.129 --> 01:46:52.139 align:start position:0%
broader policy
 
01:46:52.139 --> 01:46:55.010 align:start position:0%
broader policy
further

01:46:55.010 --> 01:46:55.020 align:start position:0%
further
 
01:46:58.189 --> 01:46:58.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:01.129 --> 01:47:01.139 align:start position:0%
can you explain to me
 
01:47:05.450 --> 01:47:05.460 align:start position:0%
what it is in in first section
 
01:47:05.460 --> 01:47:06.760 align:start position:0%
what it is in in first section
that

01:47:06.760 --> 01:47:06.770 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:47:06.770 --> 01:47:07.129 align:start position:0%
that
[Music]

01:47:07.129 --> 01:47:07.139 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:47:07.139 --> 01:47:08.890 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

01:47:08.890 --> 01:47:08.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:12.350 --> 01:47:12.360 align:start position:0%
it causes you to want us to leave that
 
01:47:12.360 --> 01:47:14.149 align:start position:0%
it causes you to want us to leave that
in

01:47:14.149 --> 01:47:14.159 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:47:17.209 --> 01:47:17.219 align:start position:0%
the first section that last sentence
 
01:47:18.709 --> 01:47:18.719 align:start position:0%
that was added by the sentence there
 
01:47:20.629 --> 01:47:20.639 align:start position:0%
this definition shall not apply to
 
01:47:20.639 --> 01:47:23.689 align:start position:0%
this definition shall not apply to
platforms

01:47:23.689 --> 01:47:23.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:25.850 --> 01:47:25.860 align:start position:0%
clarifies the depth Mission and I think
 
01:47:28.609 --> 01:47:28.619 align:start position:0%
it alleviates any concern that
 
01:47:34.129 --> 01:47:34.139 align:start position:0%
it the definition could conflict with
 
01:47:34.139 --> 01:47:34.970 align:start position:0%
it the definition could conflict with
um

01:47:34.970 --> 01:47:34.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:36.890 --> 01:47:36.900 align:start position:0%
the provision that's going to be known
 
01:47:44.330 --> 01:47:44.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:47.270 --> 01:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
okay further
 
01:47:49.609 --> 01:47:49.619 align:start position:0%
thank you very much my pleasure thank
 
01:47:49.619 --> 01:47:51.169 align:start position:0%
thank you very much my pleasure thank
you

01:47:51.169 --> 01:47:51.179 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:47:53.510 --> 01:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
so this will conclude the work session
 
01:47:58.609 --> 01:47:58.619 align:start position:0%
we have on on this bill 213.
 
01:48:02.209 --> 01:48:02.219 align:start position:0%
uh so we've completed both of the work
 
01:48:02.219 --> 01:48:03.350 align:start position:0%
uh so we've completed both of the work
sessions

01:48:03.350 --> 01:48:03.360 align:start position:0%
sessions
 
01:48:06.350 --> 01:48:06.360 align:start position:0%
and we're getting now ready down here to
 
01:48:10.850 --> 01:48:10.860 align:start position:0%
the executive session for 218 and 213.
 
01:48:14.209 --> 01:48:14.219 align:start position:0%
however we do not have amendments yet
 
01:48:21.649 --> 01:48:21.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:26.149 --> 01:48:26.159 align:start position:0%
let's take a short caucus here for both
 
01:48:26.159 --> 01:48:28.570 align:start position:0%
let's take a short caucus here for both
groups

01:48:28.570 --> 01:48:28.580 align:start position:0%
groups
 
01:48:31.390 --> 01:48:31.400 align:start position:0%
the question I would have before you on
 
01:48:35.990 --> 01:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
213 or 2 uh 18.
 
01:48:38.330 --> 01:48:38.340 align:start position:0%
is it best to retain that bill for
 
01:48:41.270 --> 01:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
further work and information as we
 
01:48:48.169 --> 01:48:48.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:50.810 --> 01:48:50.820 align:start position:0%
and 266
 
01:48:52.910 --> 01:48:52.920 align:start position:0%
yeah you can go ahead and talk about 266
 
02:09:09.169 --> 02:09:09.179 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:12.169 --> 02:09:12.179 align:start position:0%
have three bells on the docket two one
 
02:09:15.950 --> 02:09:15.960 align:start position:0%
three two one eight and two six six
 
02:09:19.129 --> 02:09:19.139 align:start position:0%
um we'll start off with uh Senate Bill
 
02:09:19.139 --> 02:09:23.450 align:start position:0%
um we'll start off with uh Senate Bill
218

02:09:23.450 --> 02:09:23.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:25.370 --> 02:09:25.380 align:start position:0%
which we've already discussed this
 
02:09:25.380 --> 02:09:26.870 align:start position:0%
which we've already discussed this
morning

02:09:26.870 --> 02:09:26.880 align:start position:0%
morning
 
02:09:29.930 --> 02:09:29.940 align:start position:0%
and I Look to representative to make a
 
02:09:32.450 --> 02:09:32.460 align:start position:0%
recommendation this is an early educator
 
02:09:34.810 --> 02:09:34.820 align:start position:0%
professional development Grant uh Bill
 
02:09:37.669 --> 02:09:37.679 align:start position:0%
representative I would like to move
 
02:09:41.270 --> 02:09:41.280 align:start position:0%
retain is there a second
 
02:09:43.550 --> 02:09:43.560 align:start position:0%
represent Belcher seconds out so we have
 
02:09:45.470 --> 02:09:45.480 align:start position:0%
a motion to retain made by
 
02:09:47.510 --> 02:09:47.520 align:start position:0%
representative second by representative
 
02:09:53.750 --> 02:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:57.169 --> 02:09:57.179 align:start position:0%
discussion yeah clearly we're not ready
 
02:10:00.589 --> 02:10:00.599 align:start position:0%
for this we have so many questions about
 
02:10:03.470 --> 02:10:03.480 align:start position:0%
it it just makes sense to retain it and
 
02:10:06.169 --> 02:10:06.179 align:start position:0%
we have unanswered questions
 
02:10:08.089 --> 02:10:08.099 align:start position:0%
it's an early Bill we need the answers
 
02:10:10.490 --> 02:10:10.500 align:start position:0%
to the questions and we don't even know
 
02:10:12.709 --> 02:10:12.719 align:start position:0%
where we stand if we do pass or we don't
 
02:10:15.470 --> 02:10:15.480 align:start position:0%
pass so we should just retain it and
 
02:10:16.729 --> 02:10:16.739 align:start position:0%
wait until we get the full information
 
02:10:18.890 --> 02:10:18.900 align:start position:0%
well Sam Belcher do you have any further
 
02:10:21.290 --> 02:10:21.300 align:start position:0%
comments I would just say that we really
 
02:10:22.790 --> 02:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
need to get clarification especially on
 
02:10:25.430 --> 02:10:25.440 align:start position:0%
whether this bill would essentially swap
 
02:10:27.709 --> 02:10:27.719 align:start position:0%
out new tax funds from New Hampshire
 
02:10:30.950 --> 02:10:30.960 align:start position:0%
taxpayers for federal tax funds not in
 
02:10:32.870 --> 02:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
addition to but instead of and that that
 
02:10:36.709 --> 02:10:36.719 align:start position:0%
would be a loss if we were to do that
 
02:10:39.530 --> 02:10:39.540 align:start position:0%
any further discussion on the bill
 
02:10:41.390 --> 02:10:41.400 align:start position:0%
not seeing any Madam clerk would you
 
02:10:46.669 --> 02:10:46.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:49.070 --> 02:10:49.080 align:start position:0%
well I've seen we have a yes go ahead
 
02:10:52.810 --> 02:10:52.820 align:start position:0%
okay repson but the motion is to retain
 
02:10:55.430 --> 02:10:55.440 align:start position:0%

the docket today is uh Senate Bill 266
 
02:12:16.490 --> 02:12:16.500 align:start position:0%
I'd love to represent paternal for a
 
02:12:16.500 --> 02:12:17.870 align:start position:0%
I'd love to represent paternal for a
motion

02:12:17.870 --> 02:12:17.880 align:start position:0%
motion
 
02:12:20.510 --> 02:12:20.520 align:start position:0%
I move on to I'm sorry
 
02:12:24.589 --> 02:12:24.599 align:start position:0%
and we've retain on Senate bill 266.
 
02:12:26.270 --> 02:12:26.280 align:start position:0%
is there a second
 
02:12:31.850 --> 02:12:31.860 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:35.390 --> 02:12:35.400 align:start position:0%
okay 266 is Opera representative
 
02:12:37.310 --> 02:12:37.320 align:start position:0%
parental do you have any discussion on
 
02:12:38.209 --> 02:12:38.219 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
02:12:40.970 --> 02:12:40.980 align:start position:0%
well as we know this bill is a huge
 
02:12:42.530 --> 02:12:42.540 align:start position:0%
amount of work we've had several work
 
02:12:45.410 --> 02:12:45.420 align:start position:0%
sessions and I don't think our work has
 
02:12:47.689 --> 02:12:47.699 align:start position:0%
even begun to come close to conclusion
 
02:12:50.270 --> 02:12:50.280 align:start position:0%
on this so we certainly require more
 
02:12:52.970 --> 02:12:52.980 align:start position:0%
time to come to an agreement on this
 
02:12:54.770 --> 02:12:54.780 align:start position:0%
important bill
 
02:12:57.770 --> 02:12:57.780 align:start position:0%
and I'll just add in as The Thinker the
 
02:13:00.530 --> 02:13:00.540 align:start position:0%
second we've had a number of work
 
02:13:04.069 --> 02:13:04.079 align:start position:0%
sessions on this bill Senate bill 266.
 
02:13:07.550 --> 02:13:07.560 align:start position:0%
over a period of days and the bill
 
02:13:10.850 --> 02:13:10.860 align:start position:0%
itself the side by sides are over 40
 
02:13:12.709 --> 02:13:12.719 align:start position:0%
pages in length
 
02:13:15.109 --> 02:13:15.119 align:start position:0%
and we've gone through and it deals with
 
02:13:18.109 --> 02:13:18.119 align:start position:0%
uh chapter 193
 
02:13:18.119 --> 02:13:19.790 align:start position:0%
uh chapter 193
ACH

02:13:19.790 --> 02:13:19.800 align:start position:0%
ACH
 
02:13:22.430 --> 02:13:22.440 align:start position:0%
Etc and there's a lot of work in there a
 
02:13:25.250 --> 02:13:25.260 align:start position:0%
lot of questions and it will take much
 
02:13:28.010 --> 02:13:28.020 align:start position:0%
more time to filter through and try to
 
02:13:31.250 --> 02:13:31.260 align:start position:0%
come up with a a a recommendation of
 
02:13:32.810 --> 02:13:32.820 align:start position:0%
moving forward or not moving forward
 
02:13:35.450 --> 02:13:35.460 align:start position:0%
with this bill so I also support the
 
02:13:37.550 --> 02:13:37.560 align:start position:0%

02:13:41.450 --> 02:13:41.460 align:start position:0%

02:14:47.089 --> 02:14:47.099 align:start position:0%
bill we have on the doc is SBE 213. I
 
02:14:48.770 --> 02:14:48.780 align:start position:0%
would just like to thank Jennifer for
 
02:14:52.609 --> 02:14:52.619 align:start position:0%
for all the work she did on 260. and
 
02:14:54.770 --> 02:14:54.780 align:start position:0%
we're not done with it yet done and
 
02:14:56.930 --> 02:14:56.940 align:start position:0%
we're going to continue a little bit of
 
02:14:59.629 --> 02:14:59.639 align:start position:0%
June September October a little bit of
 
02:15:02.569 --> 02:15:02.579 align:start position:0%
November I'm sure
 
02:15:06.050 --> 02:15:06.060 align:start position:0%
and uh so the last bill set SB 213 we're
 
02:15:07.430 --> 02:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
not going to take any action on that
 
02:15:09.109 --> 02:15:09.119 align:start position:0%
bill today
 
02:15:12.109 --> 02:15:12.119 align:start position:0%
so that we had a pretty healthy
 
02:15:15.410 --> 02:15:15.420 align:start position:0%
discussion here we narrowed down I think
 
02:15:16.850 --> 02:15:16.860 align:start position:0%
we're getting close to having some
 
02:15:19.910 --> 02:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
resolution however we don't have those
 
02:15:22.250 --> 02:15:22.260 align:start position:0%
amendments yet and so we could be
 
02:15:24.350 --> 02:15:24.360 align:start position:0%
sitting here for quite a while and it's
 
02:15:26.510 --> 02:15:26.520 align:start position:0%
not an early bill so we don't have to
 
02:15:28.390 --> 02:15:28.400 align:start position:0%
address it at this moment
 
02:15:32.149 --> 02:15:32.159 align:start position:0%
lastly or not lastly but second to the
 
02:15:34.729 --> 02:15:34.739 align:start position:0%
end I want to show you a picture of
 
02:15:38.589 --> 02:15:38.599 align:start position:0%
Riker David that is Lindsay's little boy
 
02:15:41.149 --> 02:15:41.159 align:start position:0%
she just had so I'm going to pass it
 
02:15:45.109 --> 02:15:45.119 align:start position:0%
around we only have one picture and she
 
02:15:50.870 --> 02:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
had this youngster on May 3rd to uh 2023
 
02:15:56.629 --> 02:15:56.639 align:start position:0%
at 2 14 a.m that's today and here she is
 
02:15:59.450 --> 02:15:59.460 align:start position:0%
already up with her youngster pass it
 
02:16:02.330 --> 02:16:02.340 align:start position:0%
around and then we'll go both ways but
 
02:16:04.729 --> 02:16:04.739 align:start position:0%
that's just remarkable
 
02:16:04.739 --> 02:16:05.930 align:start position:0%
that's just remarkable
yeah

02:16:05.930 --> 02:16:05.940 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:16:08.450 --> 02:16:08.460 align:start position:0%
and she looks very healthy and and
 
02:16:11.330 --> 02:16:11.340 align:start position:0%
little boy is just fantastic so
 
02:16:13.970 --> 02:16:13.980 align:start position:0%
now we do have one other issue on front
 
02:16:15.109 --> 02:16:15.119 align:start position:0%
of us here
 
02:16:17.689 --> 02:16:17.699 align:start position:0%
we have received
 
02:16:17.699 --> 02:16:19.970 align:start position:0%
we have received
from

02:16:19.970 --> 02:16:19.980 align:start position:0%
from
 
02:16:22.850 --> 02:16:22.860 align:start position:0%
our clerk's office a bill
 
02:16:26.510 --> 02:16:26.520 align:start position:0%
which has been sent to us from the
 
02:16:26.520 --> 02:16:28.010 align:start position:0%
which has been sent to us from the
Senate

02:16:28.010 --> 02:16:28.020 align:start position:0%
Senate
 
02:16:30.830 --> 02:16:30.840 align:start position:0%
here it is over here
 
02:16:32.570 --> 02:16:32.580 align:start position:0%
some of you have probably seen these
 
02:16:35.089 --> 02:16:35.099 align:start position:0%
sheets before
 
02:16:38.929 --> 02:16:38.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:41.509 --> 02:16:41.519 align:start position:0%
HB 550.
 
02:16:44.410 --> 02:16:44.420 align:start position:0%
it's been sent to us either to concur
 
02:16:47.690 --> 02:16:47.700 align:start position:0%
non-concur or non-concur and request a
 
02:16:49.910 --> 02:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
committee of conference this is when
 
02:16:52.910 --> 02:16:52.920 align:start position:0%
some other or the other side of the wall
 
02:16:55.910 --> 02:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
Senate modifies one of our bills it
 
02:16:58.190 --> 02:16:58.200 align:start position:0%
comes back to us this bill has been
 
02:17:01.490 --> 02:17:01.500 align:start position:0%
modified so we look at that see is this
 
02:17:03.469 --> 02:17:03.479 align:start position:0%
palatable to us
 
02:17:06.049 --> 02:17:06.059 align:start position:0%
or not if it's not then we can request
 
02:17:08.389 --> 02:17:08.399 align:start position:0%
either to have a committee a conference
 
02:17:10.910 --> 02:17:10.920 align:start position:0%
or non-concur
 
02:17:14.389 --> 02:17:14.399 align:start position:0%
now I'm going to pass out a copy of of
 
02:17:17.450 --> 02:17:17.460 align:start position:0%
what they've done in the Senate to you
 
02:17:19.070 --> 02:17:19.080 align:start position:0%
and it probably shouldn't take a whole
 
02:17:20.990 --> 02:17:21.000 align:start position:0%
lot of Genius here to figure out what
 
02:17:22.490 --> 02:17:22.500 align:start position:0%
they did
 
02:17:27.310 --> 02:17:27.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:29.810 --> 02:17:29.820 align:start position:0%
that's exactly right
 
02:17:32.750 --> 02:17:32.760 align:start position:0%
and so on this members of this committee
 
02:17:36.230 --> 02:17:36.240 align:start position:0%
and the purpose of this bill is Charter
 
02:17:37.849 --> 02:17:37.859 align:start position:0%
Public School disillusioned the
 
02:17:39.889 --> 02:17:39.899 align:start position:0%
committee to look at that
 
02:17:44.389 --> 02:17:44.399 align:start position:0%
and we had there will be uh four members
 
02:17:46.790 --> 02:17:46.800 align:start position:0%
of the House of Representatives we had
 
02:17:50.450 --> 02:17:50.460 align:start position:0%
two members of the Senate they want one
 
02:17:55.009 --> 02:17:55.019 align:start position:0%
it's just a long punching that's right
 
02:17:57.290 --> 02:17:57.300 align:start position:0%
that's where I went through it and
 
02:18:00.349 --> 02:18:00.359 align:start position:0%
that's the only change and so what the
 
02:18:03.650 --> 02:18:03.660 align:start position:0%
deal is on this the chairs of the
 
02:18:05.929 --> 02:18:05.939 align:start position:0%
specific committee always come to the
 
02:18:08.990 --> 02:18:09.000 align:start position:0%
committee of the whole and look for some
 
02:18:11.150 --> 02:18:11.160 align:start position:0%
kind of a agreement I don't have to do
 
02:18:12.889 --> 02:18:12.899 align:start position:0%
that but I've always done that I know
 
02:18:14.030 --> 02:18:14.040 align:start position:0%
representative Meyer to that
 
02:18:16.310 --> 02:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
representative Gile did that all the
 
02:18:17.750 --> 02:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
representatives have previously done it
 
02:18:20.089 --> 02:18:20.099 align:start position:0%
through our chairs and so I'd like to
 
02:18:22.250 --> 02:18:22.260 align:start position:0%
see a show of hands
 
02:18:24.530 --> 02:18:24.540 align:start position:0%
for those that are supportive of the
 
02:18:24.540 --> 02:18:26.049 align:start position:0%
for those that are supportive of the
Senate

02:18:26.049 --> 02:18:26.059 align:start position:0%
Senate
 
02:18:29.929 --> 02:18:29.939 align:start position:0%
Amendment and that we would concur
 
02:18:31.790 --> 02:18:31.800 align:start position:0%
and not request to committee a
 
02:18:31.800 --> 02:18:33.530 align:start position:0%
and not request to committee a
conference

02:18:33.530 --> 02:18:33.540 align:start position:0%
conference
 
02:18:36.530 --> 02:18:36.540 align:start position:0%
so we concur thank you very much so
 
02:18:38.089 --> 02:18:38.099 align:start position:0%
that's the person that will get a lot of
 
02:18:38.099 --> 02:18:39.469 align:start position:0%

these

02:18:39.469 --> 02:18:39.479 align:start position:0%

02:18:41.990 --> 02:18:42.000 align:start position:0%

02:19:17.209 --> 02:19:17.219 align:start position:0%
but I've been here with a non-germaine
 
02:19:19.429 --> 02:19:19.439 align:start position:0%
Amendment which I'm not very keen on
 
02:19:22.070 --> 02:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
doing non-germaine amendments but in
 
02:19:23.810 --> 02:19:23.820 align:start position:0%
order to do that it would have to be put
 
02:19:26.270 --> 02:19:26.280 align:start position:0%
into a hearing process I want to talk
 
02:19:28.009 --> 02:19:28.019 align:start position:0%
with some folks which are not here now
 
02:19:32.330 --> 02:19:32.340 align:start position:0%
that are referenced that bill so 136 is
 
02:19:34.610 --> 02:19:34.620 align:start position:0%
a bill that prohibits the employment or
 
02:19:36.950 --> 02:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
volunteering or of a revoked or
 
02:19:39.530 --> 02:19:39.540 align:start position:0%
suspended educator you remember that one
 
02:19:42.169 --> 02:19:42.179 align:start position:0%
yep yes yeah
 
02:19:44.690 --> 02:19:44.700 align:start position:0%
that's the only other Bill we have
 
02:19:47.270 --> 02:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
so we'll probably address both of these
 
02:19:50.330 --> 02:19:50.340 align:start position:0%
bills at the same time we do 213.
 
02:19:52.790 --> 02:19:52.800 align:start position:0%
so we'll come in just that more one more
 
02:19:52.800 --> 02:19:54.110 align:start position:0%
so we'll come in just that more one more
time

02:19:54.110 --> 02:19:54.120 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:19:56.450 --> 02:19:56.460 align:start position:0%
um any idea when
 
02:19:58.690 --> 02:19:58.700 align:start position:0%
no I really don't know
 
02:20:01.429 --> 02:20:01.439 align:start position:0%
there's no big rush on it and usually
 
02:20:03.950 --> 02:20:03.960 align:start position:0%
what we do as a committee too
 
02:20:05.510 --> 02:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
we always have some kind of little
 
02:20:08.210 --> 02:20:08.220 align:start position:0%
get-together type thing at the end
 
02:20:10.550 --> 02:20:10.560 align:start position:0%
um I was up in Quebec just this last
 
02:20:13.550 --> 02:20:13.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:14.889 --> 02:20:14.899 align:start position:0%
and and
 
02:20:17.630 --> 02:20:17.640 align:start position:0%
got some of those nice pastries and all
 
02:20:19.849 --> 02:20:19.859 align:start position:0%
that which we've had here before I can
 
02:20:21.650 --> 02:20:21.660 align:start position:0%
bring that in but also we might want to
 
02:20:23.630 --> 02:20:23.640 align:start position:0%
start thinking about you know do we want
 
02:20:25.130 --> 02:20:25.140 align:start position:0%
to do something as a total group and
 
02:20:26.330 --> 02:20:26.340 align:start position:0%
then go out to eat somewhere or
 
02:20:27.950 --> 02:20:27.960 align:start position:0%
something such we've done that in the
 
02:20:29.990 --> 02:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
past uh it's been a few years since
 
02:20:32.690 --> 02:20:32.700 align:start position:0%
we've gone that route but be thinking
 
02:20:34.310 --> 02:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
about it
 
02:20:36.410 --> 02:20:36.420 align:start position:0%
it's it's always fun we try to go
 
02:20:38.929 --> 02:20:38.939 align:start position:0%
somewhere we can walk locally unless you
 
02:20:40.130 --> 02:20:40.140 align:start position:0%
want to go to one of those wonderful
 
02:20:43.510 --> 02:20:43.520 align:start position:0%
restaurants up in Haverhill
 
02:20:46.849 --> 02:20:46.859 align:start position:0%
it's an hour and a half trip folks one
 
02:20:49.610 --> 02:20:49.620 align:start position:0%
way so we'll try and do something
 
02:20:50.870 --> 02:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
locally and I'll have a little bit of
 
02:20:53.210 --> 02:20:53.220 align:start position:0%
fun because it's been a long long year
 
02:20:55.790 --> 02:20:55.800 align:start position:0%
for us all and we do have some bills
 
02:20:57.950 --> 02:20:57.960 align:start position:0%
which we got to retain we have retained
 
02:21:00.349 --> 02:21:00.359 align:start position:0%
and if we've done all our Senate bills
 
02:21:03.050 --> 02:21:03.060 align:start position:0%
we can go through that retain process a
 
02:21:04.630 --> 02:21:04.640 align:start position:0%
little bit in June as well
 
02:21:07.849 --> 02:21:07.859 align:start position:0%
but primarily we want to use September
 
02:21:10.969 --> 02:21:10.979 align:start position:0%
October and half of November for that we
 
02:21:13.550 --> 02:21:13.560 align:start position:0%
will not be meeting at all in the month
 
02:21:16.730 --> 02:21:16.740 align:start position:0%
of July or August those two months no
 
02:21:19.190 --> 02:21:19.200 align:start position:0%
meetings at all that's out of the
 
02:21:19.200 --> 02:21:20.450 align:start position:0%
meetings at all that's out of the
equation

02:21:20.450 --> 02:21:20.460 align:start position:0%
equation
 
02:21:22.969 --> 02:21:22.979 align:start position:0%
in fact if you come in and you're doing
 
02:21:24.349 --> 02:21:24.359 align:start position:0%
some business down here they're even
 
02:21:26.330 --> 02:21:26.340 align:start position:0%
thinking about turning off the kiosks so
 
02:21:27.770 --> 02:21:27.780 align:start position:0%
you have to go up the speaker's office
 
02:21:31.010 --> 02:21:31.020 align:start position:0%
to sign in for travel that can be done
 
02:21:33.950 --> 02:21:33.960 align:start position:0%
but you'd have to go that route and then
 
02:21:35.870 --> 02:21:35.880 align:start position:0%
probably in the interim ask why you're
 
02:21:39.050 --> 02:21:39.060 align:start position:0%
down here answer reply to that so the
 
02:21:40.969 --> 02:21:40.979 align:start position:0%
idea is they want everybody staying home
 
02:21:43.010 --> 02:21:43.020 align:start position:0%
staying healthy and taking the two
 
02:21:46.309 --> 02:21:46.319 align:start position:0%
months off I concur on that we've spent
 
02:21:48.110 --> 02:21:48.120 align:start position:0%
a lot of long time here with over 100
 
02:21:50.889 --> 02:21:50.899 align:start position:0%
bills you'd be congratulated very much
 
02:21:52.730 --> 02:21:52.740 align:start position:0%
representative Damon you're thinking I
 
02:21:55.670 --> 02:21:55.680 align:start position:0%
can see the gears moving
 
02:21:57.050 --> 02:21:57.060 align:start position:0%
he's trying to remember there's a
 
02:22:00.010 --> 02:22:00.020 align:start position:0%
restaurant in April now there's
 
02:22:03.830 --> 02:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
there's not nothing in Haverhill we have
 
02:22:05.929 --> 02:22:05.939 align:start position:0%
any further committee meetings
 
02:22:08.510 --> 02:22:08.520 align:start position:0%
this week week after we we have some
 
02:22:12.290 --> 02:22:12.300 align:start position:0%
statutory commissions and oversight type
 
02:22:12.300 --> 02:22:14.210 align:start position:0%
statutory commissions and oversight type
things

02:22:14.210 --> 02:22:14.220 align:start position:0%
things
 
02:22:16.790 --> 02:22:16.800 align:start position:0%
next week There's Nothing scheduled
 
02:22:19.250 --> 02:22:19.260 align:start position:0%
nothing scheduled and because we've
 
02:22:21.290 --> 02:22:21.300 align:start position:0%
ridden ourselves a 218 today that's the
 
02:22:23.630 --> 02:22:23.640 align:start position:0%
early Bill we don't have to have a
 
02:22:25.370 --> 02:22:25.380 align:start position:0%
meeting next week is everybody good with
 
02:22:25.380 --> 02:22:27.610 align:start position:0%
meeting next week is everybody good with
that

02:22:27.610 --> 02:22:27.620 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:30.490 --> 02:22:30.500 align:start position:0%
yeah there'll be a session
 
02:22:32.330 --> 02:22:32.340 align:start position:0%
Thursdays there will be sessions
 
02:22:32.340 --> 02:22:34.570 align:start position:0%
Thursdays there will be sessions
guaranteed

02:22:34.570 --> 02:22:34.580 align:start position:0%
guaranteed
 
02:22:38.870 --> 02:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
yes yes yes yeah and the following
 
02:22:47.770 --> 02:22:47.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:50.469 --> 02:22:50.479 align:start position:0%
no I think both of them are definite
 
02:22:53.510 --> 02:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
