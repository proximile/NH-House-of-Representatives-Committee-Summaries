00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 align:start position:0%
sh I'm state representative John cluder
 
00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 align:start position:0%
from Sullivan district 10 which
 
00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 align:start position:0%
comprises the entire city of Claremont
 
00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 align:start position:0%
and and and I'm here today as the prime
 
00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 align:start position:0%
sponsor and in favor of House Bill 1237
 
00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 align:start position:0%
and I have distributed a copy of written
 
00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 align:start position:0%
testimony that I gave earlier to the
 
00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 align:start position:0%
Commerce Committee but it was given
 
00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 align:start position:0%
January 19th but it is still very
 
00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 align:start position:0%
relevant I realize your charge is more
 
00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 align:start position:0%
the revenue uh and briefly I introduced
 
00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 align:start position:0%
frankley um at the behest of a
 
00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 align:start position:0%
constituent who's very concerned about
 
00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 align:start position:0%
the current Cigar Bar law which was
 
00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 align:start position:0%
acted in
 
00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 align:start position:0%
2009 uh and basically he was concerned
 
00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 align:start position:0%
about the the revenue imp packed and I
 
00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 align:start position:0%
submitted a bill which changed that was
 
00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 align:start position:0%
going to try it for two
 
00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 align:start position:0%
years uh and I introduced it to the
 
00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 align:start position:0%
Commerce Committee uh represent
 
00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 align:start position:0%
Stapleton and I who's the
 
00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor and he he was concerned that
 
00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 align:start position:0%
this well-intentioned law from 2009 has
 
00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 align:start position:0%
adversely affected certain cigar bars in
 
00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 align:start position:0%
the state and forced to modify their
 
00:03:25.869 --> 00:03:25.879 align:start position:0%
business in order not to lose their
 
00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 align:start position:0%
license and he started this you we had
 
00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 align:start position:0%
started this convers
 
00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 align:start position:0%
September of last year and he mentioned
 
00:03:35.429 --> 00:03:35.439 align:start position:0%
even though he's from claron a specific
 
00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 align:start position:0%
nashille cigar bar to support this
 
00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:40.360 align:start position:0%
assertion and he also said
 
00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 align:start position:0%
the ongoing covid-19 pandemic which as
 
00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 align:start position:0%
all know has negatively impacted many
 
00:03:49.429 --> 00:03:49.439 align:start position:0%
bars restaurants and hotels he believes
 
00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 align:start position:0%
our state government should be
 
00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 align:start position:0%
considering revising some of the
 
00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 align:start position:0%
provisions of House Bill 392 which was
 
00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 align:start position:0%
the original bill in 2009 so as to allow
 
00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 align:start position:0%
Cigar Bar to compete with other drinking
 
00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 align:start position:0%
and eating establishments also he
 
00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 align:start position:0%
believes revising The Cigar Bar law
 
00:04:09.429 --> 00:04:09.439 align:start position:0%
would allow our constituents to more
 
00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 align:start position:0%
easily to gather in places to socialize
 
00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 align:start position:0%
he is very concerned that because of the
 
00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:17.079 align:start position:0%
pandemic and the restrictions that a lot
 
00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 align:start position:0%
of people have been offsite gathering
 
00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:22.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 align:start position:0%
shouldn't basically one of his in fact
 
00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 align:start position:0%
concerns about reducing roadside litter
 
00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 align:start position:0%
and I know some people might think what
 
00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 align:start position:0%
how would that reduce well that people
 
00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
have been going in the woods and
 
00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 align:start position:0%
drinking uh and I realize that's a
 
00:04:37.029 --> 00:04:37.039 align:start position:0%
that's an ongoing problem since the
 
00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 align:start position:0%
pandemic but he feels that something
 
00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:42.199 align:start position:0%
should be done and he also feels that
 
00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 align:start position:0%
constituents should be able to gather
 
00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:45.199 align:start position:0%
and establish their
 
00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:48.160 align:start position:0%
choice uh you know reduce the roadside
 
00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 align:start position:0%
litter as well as generate a little more
 
00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 align:start position:0%
Revenue in cigar and liquor sales which
 
00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:54.400 align:start position:0%
is I know the reason this committee has
 
00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 align:start position:0%
has this
 
00:05:00.749 --> 00:05:00.759 align:start position:0%
bill um basically my original intent the
 
00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
intent with the original bill was to
 
00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 align:start position:0%
reduce the revenue for two years only I
 
00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:06.199 align:start position:0%
realize the amended law which I am in
 
00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 align:start position:0%
favor of makes a few different
 
00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:11.600 align:start position:0%
changes and even though I thought I
 
00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120 align:start position:0%
voted for this law in 2009 and I thought
 
00:05:16.029 --> 00:05:16.039 align:start position:0%
it was a good bill I think from time to
 
00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:17.720 align:start position:0%
time we would should look at the laws
 
00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:20.120 align:start position:0%
that we pass and see if they could be
 
00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:22.120 align:start position:0%
improved see how they're working first
 
00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:24.199 align:start position:0%
of all and if they're working fine but
 
00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:25.880 align:start position:0%
if they can be tweaked to make them
 
00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:28.600 align:start position:0%
better in principle I believe this what
 
00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:30.520 align:start position:0%
we should do
 
00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:32.560 align:start position:0%
uh and I just want to be clear
 
00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:35.360 align:start position:0%
this constituent came to me he was very
 
00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:36.919 align:start position:0%
persuasive because for readers
 
00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:39.000 align:start position:0%
information I'm not a user of cigars or
 
00:05:41.189 --> 00:05:41.199 align:start position:0%
other tobacco products of any kind I
 
00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:43.479 align:start position:0%
don't frequent bars I haven't since I
 
00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:45.600 align:start position:0%
was in college including cigar bars on a
 
00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:48.560 align:start position:0%
regular basis generally I I just do
 
00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:50.600 align:start position:0%
light consumption of alcohol beverages
 
00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:53.240 align:start position:0%
at home this isn't the type of bill that
 
00:05:55.469 --> 00:05:55.479 align:start position:0%
I normally would sponsor but I believe
 
00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:57.400 align:start position:0%
my constituent raised some important
 
00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:00.440 align:start position:0%
concerns about our present Cigar Bar law
 
00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:03.400 align:start position:0%
and so I would urge you to pass this
 
00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:05.600 align:start position:0%
bill as amended an amendment that was
 
00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:07.720 align:start position:0%
approved by the Commerce
 
00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:11.360 align:start position:0%
Committee uh and uh and that's it as far
 
00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:13.120 align:start position:0%
as my testimony I'm willing to take any
 
00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:16.560 align:start position:0%
questions try to answer them if I can
 
00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:21.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:23.880 align:start position:0%
C representa Aly followed by
 
00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:26.840 align:start position:0%
representative ABY okay all right yes
 
00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:30.240 align:start position:0%
representative Aly thank you uh we need
 
00:06:33.629 --> 00:06:33.639 align:start position:0%
to see see what the fiscal notes doing
 
00:06:35.749 --> 00:06:35.759 align:start position:0%
this fiscal note is based on the
 
00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:38.680 align:start position:0%
original bill I tried to F get the
 
00:06:41.029 --> 00:06:41.039 align:start position:0%
original bill online and it came up
 
00:06:44.189 --> 00:06:44.199 align:start position:0%
blank it wouldn't let me in so can you
 
00:06:48.309 --> 00:06:48.319 align:start position:0%
tell us what on What has been changed is
 
00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:50.520 align:start position:0%
it just this business about a two-year
 
00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:54.680 align:start position:0%
pilot that seems to be involved the okay
 
00:06:57.909 --> 00:06:57.919 align:start position:0%
as the intent and and the intent uh
 
00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:00.840 align:start position:0%
basically would be
 
00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:03.840 align:start position:0%
okay no no no the changes that Commerce
 
00:07:06.189 --> 00:07:06.199 align:start position:0%
made the Commerce made
 
00:07:10.189 --> 00:07:10.199 align:start position:0%
okay um quickly here I need to turn to
 
00:07:12.469 --> 00:07:12.479 align:start position:0%
the bill this is a bit of a complicated
 
00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:17.160 align:start position:0%
subject for me too so bear with me
 
00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:18.840 align:start position:0%
um all
 
00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:27.189 --> 00:07:27.199 align:start position:0%
believe okay it would allow them
 
00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:37.309 --> 00:07:37.319 align:start position:0%
209 that they it would allow them as I
 
00:07:38.589 --> 00:07:38.599 align:start position:0%
understand I think the committee
 
00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:40.520 align:start position:0%
Commerce committee's intent with the
 
00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:44.560 align:start position:0%
amendment is to allow cigar bars to
 
00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
generate additional revenue from things
 
00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:51.240 align:start position:0%
other than cigars other tobacco sales
 
00:07:54.189 --> 00:07:54.199 align:start position:0%
including cigarettes and loose loose
 
00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:56.840 align:start position:0%
tobacco it takes out that provision of
 
00:07:58.029 --> 00:07:58.039 align:start position:0%
the original
 
00:08:00.149 --> 00:08:00.159 align:start position:0%
Law um
 
00:08:03.589 --> 00:08:03.599 align:start position:0%
and basically that's that
 
00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:08.000 align:start position:0%
was as I read the amendment of for 1237
 
00:08:09.909 --> 00:08:09.919 align:start position:0%
I'm reading it from the house record
 
00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:12.560 align:start position:0%
excuse me on no the original what did
 
00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:15.000 align:start position:0%
the original Bill say okay the original
 
00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:18.720 align:start position:0%
Bill not the original bill and I worked
 
00:08:22.189 --> 00:08:22.199 align:start position:0%
with legislative services on this uh the
 
00:08:22.199 --> 00:08:24.350 align:start position:0%
with legislative services on this uh the
original

00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:24.360 align:start position:0%
original
 
00:08:27.589 --> 00:08:27.599 align:start position:0%
Bill yes the original bill that I
 
00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:30.840 align:start position:0%
introduced the one that was introduced
 
00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:33.640 align:start position:0%
to the house the introduced I was going
 
00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:36.640 align:start position:0%
to cut ital note is BAS okay let me I'm
 
00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
basically I was going to cut
 
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.589 align:start position:0%
basically I was going to cut
the

00:08:40.589 --> 00:08:40.599 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:45.360 align:start position:0%
okay just now okay does anyone have it
 
00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:46.920 align:start position:0%
the 60
 
00:08:51.949 --> 00:08:51.959 align:start position:0%
okayl computer it online it's yeah okay
 
00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:54.360 align:start position:0%
I cut the percent yeah M wasn't it's in
 
00:08:56.910 --> 00:08:56.920 align:start position:0%
the first paragraph to I reduced it to
 
00:08:59.870 --> 00:08:59.880 align:start position:0%
30% but I made it only
 
00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:02.360 align:start position:0%
good for two years to use it see it on a
 
00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:05.440 align:start position:0%
trial basis that was my intent uh you
 
00:09:07.509 --> 00:09:07.519 align:start position:0%
could argue whether two years but uh
 
00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:09.640 align:start position:0%
after talking with legislative Services
 
00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:11.200 align:start position:0%
they thought that would be a better way
 
00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
to go rather than making it
 
00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
permanent um so and M I think he in fact
 
00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
wanted to re to eliminate it entirely
 
00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:23.800 align:start position:0%
from 60 to zero after talking with
 
00:09:25.389 --> 00:09:25.399 align:start position:0%
people at legislative services and
 
00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:26.880 align:start position:0%
conferring with my
 
00:09:29.829 --> 00:09:29.839 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor and he finally I he was
 
00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:32.320 align:start position:0%
agreeable to lowering it to
 
00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
30% having it for two years and seeing
 
00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:39.440 align:start position:0%
how it would affect Cigar Bar Revenue it
 
00:09:41.829 --> 00:09:41.839 align:start position:0%
was also an intent to see because I know
 
00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:44.040 align:start position:0%
the pandemic and hopefully this pandemic
 
00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
will soon be over but nevertheless it
 
00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:50.000 align:start position:0%
has affected a lot of cigar bars bars
 
00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:51.480 align:start position:0%
restaurants and other eating and
 
00:09:54.389 --> 00:09:54.399 align:start position:0%
drinking establishments so our the
 
00:09:56.949 --> 00:09:56.959 align:start position:0%
intent of the original bill was to lower
 
00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:00.760 align:start position:0%
it from 60 to 30% for two years only
 
00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
that was my intent when I filed the
 
00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:04.200 align:start position:0%
original bill that was heard before
 
00:10:06.509 --> 00:10:06.519 align:start position:0%
Commerce on January
 
00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:08.720 align:start position:0%
19th so I don't know if that helps you
 
00:10:11.829 --> 00:10:11.839 align:start position:0%
representative excuse me was that the
 
00:10:11.839 --> 00:10:13.069 align:start position:0%
representative excuse me was that the
only

00:10:13.069 --> 00:10:13.079 align:start position:0%
only
 
00:10:16.949 --> 00:10:16.959 align:start position:0%
change that's as I right I don't have
 
00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:19.560 align:start position:0%
the original bill in front of me I I
 
00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:21.920 align:start position:0%
have what was amended by the house but I
 
00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:24.320 align:start position:0%
believe that was that was the only
 
00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
change to the current Cigar Bar law all
 
00:10:29.829 --> 00:10:29.839 align:start position:0%
right represent Lang you have that yes I
 
00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:32.000 align:start position:0%
do have the the original bill as filed
 
00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:33.920 align:start position:0%
would have changed the percentage in
 
00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:36.200 align:start position:0%
section one down to
 
00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:38.560 align:start position:0%
30% and and that was for a two-year
 
00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
period and then at the end of the
 
00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:43.120 align:start position:0%
twoyear period it would go back to 60% y
 
00:10:44.629 --> 00:10:44.639 align:start position:0%
that was the original Bill and then what
 
00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:46.600 align:start position:0%
they did is then they added the instead
 
00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:47.920 align:start position:0%
of doing that they added cigarettes and
 
00:10:50.269 --> 00:10:50.279 align:start position:0%
lose tobacco correct they they took away
 
00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:52.480 align:start position:0%
the two-year provision they left it at
 
00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:54.600 align:start position:0%
60% and they added in under the
 
00:10:56.389 --> 00:10:56.399 align:start position:0%
amendment uh loose tobacco and
 
00:11:02.069 --> 00:11:02.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:04.760 align:start position:0%
are you all set represent El me yeah I'm
 
00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:07.720 align:start position:0%
going to have to process the fiscal note
 
00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:10.040 align:start position:0%
comment and I'm sorry representative Al
 
00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:11.600 align:start position:0%
you there's not not an updated fiscal
 
00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:13.600 align:start position:0%
note there should be I mean I understand
 
00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:15.440 align:start position:0%
you need one probably before you passed
 
00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
this bill there hasn't been time okay
 
00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:20.200 align:start position:0%
all right representative browny yes just
 
00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
to make sure we understand what we're
 
00:11:24.509 --> 00:11:24.519 align:start position:0%
talking about um first because we we
 
00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:26.360 align:start position:0%
deal a lot with smoke shops which is not
 
00:11:27.949 --> 00:11:27.959 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about here yeah cigar
 
00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:29.480 align:start position:0%
we're talking about Cigar Bar here we're
 
00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:31.600 align:start position:0%
talking about cigar bars okay because I
 
00:11:33.949 --> 00:11:33.959 align:start position:0%
saw yador mentioned
 
00:11:36.829 --> 00:11:36.839 align:start position:0%
here I mean the way I read this is
 
00:11:41.829 --> 00:11:41.839 align:start position:0%
related from sale of of uh cigar related
 
00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:45.000 align:start position:0%
products so it's always cigars now we
 
00:11:46.990 --> 00:11:47.000 align:start position:0%
added cigarettes and
 
00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:49.160 align:start position:0%
tobacco it wasn't your original bill but
 
00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:51.200 align:start position:0%
that's was the Compromise the bill it
 
00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:54.200 align:start position:0%
was a comp that I mean the the chairman
 
00:11:56.389 --> 00:11:56.399 align:start position:0%
uh the Commerce chairman and I think a
 
00:11:57.949 --> 00:11:57.959 align:start position:0%
lot of the committee felt that this the
 
00:11:59.389 --> 00:11:59.399 align:start position:0%
present law was working work they were
 
00:12:00.949 --> 00:12:00.959 align:start position:0%
willing to look at tweaks but they
 
00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:03.440 align:start position:0%
didn't think my bill as I had submitted
 
00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:05.560 align:start position:0%
it originally was the right type of
 
00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:09.680 align:start position:0%
tweak right and that's the 60% and then
 
00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:13.480 align:start position:0%
the what's non-tobacco products which is
 
00:12:15.949 --> 00:12:15.959 align:start position:0%
I would imagine they sell some food and
 
00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:19.240 align:start position:0%
they sell some alcohol is that correct
 
00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:21.680 align:start position:0%
is that what we're that's that that's
 
00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
the part that's been a problem they're
 
00:12:26.030 --> 00:12:26.040 align:start position:0%
not selling enough food in or selling
 
00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:28.240 align:start position:0%
too much food or not enough cigars but
 
00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:29.560 align:start position:0%
too much food
 
00:12:33.189 --> 00:12:33.199 align:start position:0%
and and uh and alcohol is that an
 
00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:35.240 align:start position:0%
assumption or no I'm asking the question
 
00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:36.560 align:start position:0%
is that the problem is that the basic
 
00:12:38.069 --> 00:12:38.079 align:start position:0%
problem understanding cigar bars their
 
00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:41.240 align:start position:0%
main purpose was to to sell cigars they
 
00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:44.320 align:start position:0%
weren't bars as we we know them I'll
 
00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
admit I don't know if anybody from
 
00:12:47.509 --> 00:12:47.519 align:start position:0%
Commerce could clarify that or anybody
 
00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
else here but I think my my their intent
 
00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:54.040 align:start position:0%
I mean the intent of this amendment is
 
00:12:57.150 --> 00:12:57.160 align:start position:0%
to increase Revenue tobacco
 
00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:00.360 align:start position:0%
Revenue uh period as the way they have
 
00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:02.920 align:start position:0%
amended it I and I'll admit I cannot
 
00:13:05.509 --> 00:13:05.519 align:start position:0%
answer the question whether Cigar Bar my
 
00:13:06.629 --> 00:13:06.639 align:start position:0%
understanding is I I'm not sure whether
 
00:13:08.069 --> 00:13:08.079 align:start position:0%
cigar bars are allowed to sell other
 
00:13:10.509 --> 00:13:10.519 align:start position:0%
stuff like alcohol their main purpose is
 
00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
is cigar
 
00:13:17.069 --> 00:13:17.079 align:start position:0%
bars follow followup yeah so I mean um
 
00:13:19.269 --> 00:13:19.279 align:start position:0%
my recollection and please others and
 
00:13:21.389 --> 00:13:21.399 align:start position:0%
Ways and Means help me out here but or
 
00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:24.600 align:start position:0%
anybody else in the audience is that the
 
00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:27.160 align:start position:0%
cigar bar is it's a social place you go
 
00:13:29.509 --> 00:13:29.519 align:start position:0%
you smoke cigars I'm assuming premium
 
00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
cigars for the most
 
00:13:34.949 --> 00:13:34.959 align:start position:0%
part um and then but along with that
 
00:13:36.389 --> 00:13:36.399 align:start position:0%
they're going to sell beverages they're
 
00:13:37.829 --> 00:13:37.839 align:start position:0%
going to sell probably alcoholic
 
00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
beverages or other Beverages and some
 
00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:42.680 align:start position:0%
food but the way we categorize it as a
 
00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:44.160 align:start position:0%
cigar bar not a
 
00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:47.800 align:start position:0%
restaurant is by saying well 60% and
 
00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:49.600 align:start position:0%
this is current law
 
00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
60% has to be cigars that are sold and
 
00:13:54.829 --> 00:13:54.839 align:start position:0%
not the other is the way I interpret it
 
00:13:58.189 --> 00:13:58.199 align:start position:0%
so all this bill does now is it says wow
 
00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:00.560 align:start position:0%
in that 60% were adding well let him
 
00:14:03.949 --> 00:14:03.959 align:start position:0%
sell cigarettes and let him sell loose
 
00:14:09.189 --> 00:14:09.199 align:start position:0%
tobacco uh to help meet that 60%
 
00:14:13.749 --> 00:14:13.759 align:start position:0%
Target uh and uh I mean is that what you
 
00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:15.920 align:start position:0%
see or I I think I think so yeah it's a
 
00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:19.120 align:start position:0%
complicated subject and as I said I have
 
00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
learned a lot about cigar bars in the
 
00:14:24.189 --> 00:14:24.199 align:start position:0%
last few months uh and I almost my
 
00:14:25.949 --> 00:14:25.959 align:start position:0%
prescrition constient was very
 
00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:28.320 align:start position:0%
persuasive I mean I think the law was
 
00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:30.120 align:start position:0%
working fairly well but you persuaded me
 
00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:31.800 align:start position:0%
that we could maybe we should do a few
 
00:14:33.749 --> 00:14:33.759 align:start position:0%
tweaks of it and you can argue what
 
00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:35.880 align:start position:0%
tweaks are better than others i s he
 
00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:38.560 align:start position:0%
suggested and I go went along of one
 
00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:40.480 align:start position:0%
tweak the Commerce the majority of the
 
00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:43.120 align:start position:0%
Commerce Committee uh suggested another
 
00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:45.320 align:start position:0%
tweak okay the constituent by the way
 
00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
seems he's not here seems to be happy
 
00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:51.160 align:start position:0%
with it so I mean I I would urge this
 
00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:54.560 align:start position:0%
committee to pass this bill in some form
 
00:14:56.670 --> 00:14:56.680 align:start position:0%
but preferably is amended by Commerce
 
00:14:58.829 --> 00:14:58.839 align:start position:0%
but if you need to add stuff that's fine
 
00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:01.120 align:start position:0%
too because I think the constituent
 
00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
wanted the US to be able to increase
 
00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:05.920 align:start position:0%
revenue from cigar part that was one of
 
00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:08.680 align:start position:0%
the intense uh you know and I mentioned
 
00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:10.720 align:start position:0%
that as I said it in my testimony on
 
00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
January 19th well follow up yeah I mean
 
00:15:15.629 --> 00:15:15.639 align:start position:0%
the bill before us is the bill amended
 
00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:17.120 align:start position:0%
by the house so that's the bill we're
 
00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:19.720 align:start position:0%
dealing with not the original bill first
 
00:15:23.389 --> 00:15:23.399 align:start position:0%
off and um I guess the question for us
 
00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:26.360 align:start position:0%
is do we want to add cigarettes and lose
 
00:15:27.629 --> 00:15:27.639 align:start position:0%
tobacco I'm trying to understand the
 
00:15:30.309 --> 00:15:30.319 align:start position:0%
motivation how's that going to help it's
 
00:15:31.870 --> 00:15:31.880 align:start position:0%
I I guess it's going to help them hit
 
00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:32.790 align:start position:0%
I I guess it's going to help them hit
that

00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:32.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:15:35.949 --> 00:15:35.959 align:start position:0%
60% right I is i that's my understanding
 
00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:37.800 align:start position:0%
yes and I think not if we don't do this
 
00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:38.800 align:start position:0%
that some of these are going to go out
 
00:15:41.829 --> 00:15:41.839 align:start position:0%
of business is is that safe it could I I
 
00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
mean I'm not I you I would say they
 
00:15:47.069 --> 00:15:47.079 align:start position:0%
could I mean I I'm not I can't
 
00:15:48.949 --> 00:15:48.959 align:start position:0%
categorically say if we didn't do this
 
00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
they such cigar bars would go out of
 
00:15:52.829 --> 00:15:52.839 align:start position:0%
business but it's possible all right
 
00:15:52.839 --> 00:15:54.870 align:start position:0%
business but it's possible all right
thank

00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:54.880 align:start position:0%

00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
that he he's one of the co-sponsors
 
00:16:20.389 --> 00:16:20.399 align:start position:0%
would you if I know he has to fill out a
 
00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:23.160 align:start position:0%
pink card maybe or can come up or I
 
00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:25.560 align:start position:0%
don't know what the procedure
 
00:16:27.749 --> 00:16:27.759 align:start position:0%
is all right thank you representative
 
00:16:27.759 --> 00:16:37.710 align:start position:0%
is all right thank you representative
Stapleton

00:16:37.710 --> 00:16:37.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:39.509 --> 00:16:39.519 align:start position:0%
I I would assume it's a problem
 
00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:41.880 align:start position:0%
otherwise we wouldn't be filing this
 
00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:45.800 align:start position:0%
bill so I'm Walt Stapleton a co-sponsor
 
00:16:48.749 --> 00:16:48.759 align:start position:0%
and uh board three Claremont
 
00:16:51.069 --> 00:16:51.079 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan County District
 
00:16:55.230 --> 00:16:55.240 align:start position:0%
5 um in the last hearing we had uh and
 
00:16:57.110 --> 00:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
also when I talked to the attorney in
 
00:16:59.470 --> 00:16:59.480 align:start position:0%
the department relative to that there
 
00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:00.920 align:start position:0%
were a couple of
 
00:17:06.590 --> 00:17:06.600 align:start position:0%
concerns um and and the attorney uh s
 
00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:09.760 align:start position:0%
said that they were having two or
 
00:17:13.789 --> 00:17:13.799 align:start position:0%
three um of these establishments having
 
00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:17.160 align:start position:0%
difficulty meeting the threshold of
 
00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
qualifying uh to continue to qualify for
 
00:17:21.549 --> 00:17:21.559 align:start position:0%
their license at the
 
00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:25.000 align:start position:0%
60% so we suggested that they lower the
 
00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:28.640 align:start position:0%
percent uh to something that would uh
 
00:17:30.430 --> 00:17:30.440 align:start position:0%
reduce that
 
00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
barrier um and uh at the same time I
 
00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:37.440 align:start position:0%
also says why you know you got cigars
 
00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:39.960 align:start position:0%
but you can't use pipes and pipe tobacco
 
00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:43.280 align:start position:0%
or cigarettes I mean a smoking
 
00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:45.240 align:start position:0%
environment uh doesn't matter what
 
00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:47.640 align:start position:0%
you're smoking and so I think they took
 
00:17:51.029 --> 00:17:51.039 align:start position:0%
that to heart and decided and I'm sure
 
00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:53.080 align:start position:0%
they looked at it decided that adding
 
00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
the cigarettes loose tobacco pipe
 
00:17:58.789 --> 00:17:58.799 align:start position:0%
tobacco Etc was uh would be enough to
 
00:18:03.390 --> 00:18:03.400 align:start position:0%
attract the clientele to put the um to
 
00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:05.720 align:start position:0%
put to enable those two or three with
 
00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:07.880 align:start position:0%
difficulty to meet the
 
00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
threshold and that and that's my
 
00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:12.600 align:start position:0%
understanding of uh you know why they
 
00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:15.320 align:start position:0%
came to this uh adding the cigarettes
 
00:18:18.029 --> 00:18:18.039 align:start position:0%
and loose tobacco instead of reducing
 
00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:21.240 align:start position:0%
the overall qualifying
 
00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:22.990 align:start position:0%
the overall qualifying
percentage

00:18:22.990 --> 00:18:23.000 align:start position:0%
percentage
 
00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:27.320 align:start position:0%
okay representative ha hacken Phillips
 
00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:29.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:30.760 align:start position:0%
representatives for taking my question
 
00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:33.440 align:start position:0%
I'm just looking at the RSA chapter
 
00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:37.200 align:start position:0%
178 colon 20-a right now and under
 
00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
subsection Roman numeral I guess it's
 
00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:41.320 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral 2 subsection a where it
 
00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:44.400 align:start position:0%
defines what a cigar bar is um this is
 
00:18:45.669 --> 00:18:45.679 align:start position:0%
you know the relevant section that
 
00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:48.320 align:start position:0%
you're attempting to to amend here but
 
00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:51.280 align:start position:0%
if you drop down to section subsection D
 
00:18:54.190 --> 00:18:54.200 align:start position:0%
of that same definition it mentions that
 
00:18:56.830 --> 00:18:56.840 align:start position:0%
the seabar would not allow cigarette
 
00:18:58.870 --> 00:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
smoking or the sale of food on the
 
00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:02.360 align:start position:0%
premises so my question is if the intent
 
00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:06.360 align:start position:0%
is to allow greater C Cigar Bar smoking
 
00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:08.440 align:start position:0%
to widen that from you know the premium
 
00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:10.760 align:start position:0%
cigars that we're speaking of to also
 
00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
include loose tobacco by pipe perhaps or
 
00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:16.520 align:start position:0%
um cigarettes in this instance um but
 
00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:18.840 align:start position:0%
it's still not permissible to smoke
 
00:19:21.149 --> 00:19:21.159 align:start position:0%
cigarettes in a cigar bar um is it
 
00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:22.840 align:start position:0%
really going to be that much of a help
 
00:19:25.669 --> 00:19:25.679 align:start position:0%
to increase that Revenue percentage by
 
00:19:26.990 --> 00:19:27.000 align:start position:0%
also selling cigarettes and loose
 
00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:28.960 align:start position:0%
tobacco if they're not able to use it in
 
00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:30.190 align:start position:0%
tobacco if they're not able to use it in
the

00:19:30.190 --> 00:19:30.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:34.120 align:start position:0%
location and that section 178 you say
 
00:19:37.549 --> 00:19:37.559 align:start position:0%
yep section 178 col 20-a this is the
 
00:19:39.669 --> 00:19:39.679 align:start position:0%
relevant section for the definition of
 
00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
what a cigar bar is and that's a
 
00:19:44.549 --> 00:19:44.559 align:start position:0%
Prohibition it does explicitly say under
 
00:19:47.070 --> 00:19:47.080 align:start position:0%
subsection D that a cigar bar does not
 
00:19:49.149 --> 00:19:49.159 align:start position:0%
allow cigarette smoking or the sale of
 
00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:51.360 align:start position:0%
food on the
 
00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:53.880 align:start position:0%
premises that may very well be another
 
00:19:55.950 --> 00:19:55.960 align:start position:0%
section of law that has to be amended to
 
00:20:00.149 --> 00:20:00.159 align:start position:0%
enable this particular bill to have a
 
00:20:02.669 --> 00:20:02.679 align:start position:0%
useful effect yeah I would think that if
 
00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:04.240 align:start position:0%
that was the intent that you would need
 
00:20:06.190 --> 00:20:06.200 align:start position:0%
additional changes but I would still
 
00:20:09.190 --> 00:20:09.200 align:start position:0%
recommend um acceptance and passage of
 
00:20:11.789 --> 00:20:11.799 align:start position:0%
this as a first step and then we go to
 
00:20:15.029 --> 00:20:15.039 align:start position:0%
make the uh technical correction on 178
 
00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
on another Bill thank you Mr
 
00:20:19.870 --> 00:20:19.880 align:start position:0%
chairman representative
 
00:20:23.470 --> 00:20:23.480 align:start position:0%
Jian followed by represent thank you Mr
 
00:20:25.590 --> 00:20:25.600 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:27.149 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
question

00:20:27.149 --> 00:20:27.159 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:20:27.159 --> 00:20:28.750 align:start position:0%
question
um

00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:28.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:30.640 align:start position:0%
it sounds like this mainly developed
 
00:20:35.390 --> 00:20:35.400 align:start position:0%
during Co um as Co impacted a lot of
 
00:20:38.029 --> 00:20:38.039 align:start position:0%
establishments and with the rapidly
 
00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
decreasing numbers I think lately in New
 
00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they were they were we were
 
00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:42.590 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they were they were we were
down

00:20:42.590 --> 00:20:42.600 align:start position:0%
down
 
00:20:45.190 --> 00:20:45.200 align:start position:0%
to uh maybe about a thou a little over a
 
00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:47.360 align:start position:0%
thousand Active cases and and less than
 
00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
100 hospitalizations so with the with
 
00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:52.960 align:start position:0%
with the Way co is going with the
 
00:20:57.070 --> 00:20:57.080 align:start position:0%
reopening of of many um establishments
 
00:20:59.549 --> 00:20:59.559 align:start position:0%
and just ease of op operation is this
 
00:21:02.669 --> 00:21:02.679 align:start position:0%
bill potentially becoming moot thank you
 
00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:06.400 align:start position:0%
for the question um I would say no and
 
00:21:09.149 --> 00:21:09.159 align:start position:0%
the reason is is that Co has really
 
00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:10.960 align:start position:0%
disrupted our
 
00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
lifestyles and our usage of outside
 
00:21:16.350 --> 00:21:16.360 align:start position:0%
establishments for food and
 
00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:19.080 align:start position:0%
entertainment and now we have uh the
 
00:21:21.870 --> 00:21:21.880 align:start position:0%
Ukrainian war and gas is going up even
 
00:21:24.549 --> 00:21:24.559 align:start position:0%
as we speak and heating oil and that's
 
00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:26.960 align:start position:0%
going to inhibit uh people use of
 
00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:30.600 align:start position:0%
automobiles for social and pleasure um
 
00:21:33.549 --> 00:21:33.559 align:start position:0%
usage and so I think this is more
 
00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:36.600 align:start position:0%
important than ever to keep this to have
 
00:21:40.909 --> 00:21:40.919 align:start position:0%
this uh allowance on on the bo thank you
 
00:21:44.789 --> 00:21:44.799 align:start position:0%
represent yle Follow by
 
00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:49.120 align:start position:0%
represent thank you Mr chair the
 
00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:52.360 align:start position:0%
question is setting the the threshold to
 
00:21:56.669 --> 00:21:56.679 align:start position:0%
qualify for a a cigar bar I I'm sit on
 
00:21:58.789 --> 00:21:58.799 align:start position:0%
the planning board in Hudson we have a a
 
00:22:01.269 --> 00:22:01.279 align:start position:0%
place called Al Toro in town that move
 
00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:02.840 align:start position:0%
from one side of the street to the other
 
00:22:04.350 --> 00:22:04.360 align:start position:0%
side of the street changing you see know
 
00:22:08.149 --> 00:22:08.159 align:start position:0%
the whole typical BS that goes with uh
 
00:22:10.669 --> 00:22:10.679 align:start position:0%
relocating your
 
00:22:13.029 --> 00:22:13.039 align:start position:0%
property his testimony in the planning
 
00:22:16.149 --> 00:22:16.159 align:start position:0%
board was that the anciliary products to
 
00:22:19.549 --> 00:22:19.559 align:start position:0%
meet meet his 60% threshold to qualify
 
00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:23.080 align:start position:0%
as a cigar bar were sold off permit to
 
00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:24.760 align:start position:0%
the guys going they went in they had
 
00:22:26.990 --> 00:22:27.000 align:start position:0%
their drinks they had a a sandwich or
 
00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:28.840 align:start position:0%
something they took their and put it in
 
00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:31.360 align:start position:0%
the uh uh bourbon so they could have a
 
00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
nice soft taste to it as I don't know I
 
00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
don't call the cigar bars but he
 
00:22:39.149 --> 00:22:39.159 align:start position:0%
explained the whole thing um and that
 
00:22:41.390 --> 00:22:41.400 align:start position:0%
they needed that extra money or that
 
00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:42.669 align:start position:0%
they needed that extra money or that
extra

00:22:42.669 --> 00:22:42.679 align:start position:0%
extra
 
00:22:45.310 --> 00:22:45.320 align:start position:0%
percentage so they can get the
 
00:22:48.149 --> 00:22:48.159 align:start position:0%
qualification under law as represented
 
00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:50.640 align:start position:0%
hackin Phillips put it out as a cigar
 
00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:54.320 align:start position:0%
bar so why are we eliminating it would
 
00:22:58.669 --> 00:22:58.679 align:start position:0%
it not eliminate the cigar bars in their
 
00:23:00.909 --> 00:23:00.919 align:start position:0%
entirety or am I misreading
 
00:23:03.990 --> 00:23:04.000 align:start position:0%
this thank you Mr
 
00:23:08.510 --> 00:23:08.520 align:start position:0%
chair yeah okay representative I I
 
00:23:10.909 --> 00:23:10.919 align:start position:0%
mean I think there were some problems
 
00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
with some now whether all cigar
 
00:23:16.510 --> 00:23:16.520 align:start position:0%
bars uh have been hurt by the pre
 
00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:18.360 align:start position:0%
present law been
 
00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:19.909 align:start position:0%
present law been
struggling

00:23:19.909 --> 00:23:19.919 align:start position:0%
struggling
 
00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:22.960 align:start position:0%
but I I think this bill just aims to try
 
00:23:24.950 --> 00:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
to help them I mean with all you know
 
00:23:27.549 --> 00:23:27.559 align:start position:0%
and that's at least from the perspective
 
00:23:29.950 --> 00:23:29.960 align:start position:0%
myself and represent of
 
00:23:33.070 --> 00:23:33.080 align:start position:0%
Stapleton so I mean I cigar bars may
 
00:23:34.789 --> 00:23:34.799 align:start position:0%
vary I I realize that some cigar
 
00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:36.240 align:start position:0%
probably are doing better than others
 
00:23:37.669 --> 00:23:37.679 align:start position:0%
throughout the state depending on where
 
00:23:40.430 --> 00:23:40.440 align:start position:0%
they're located okay represent El
 
00:23:44.789 --> 00:23:44.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
Nunes thank you I think we've got two
 
00:23:51.310 --> 00:23:51.320 align:start position:0%
separate problems here one of them is
 
00:23:54.830 --> 00:23:54.840 align:start position:0%
whether this actually helps and I wanted
 
00:23:56.990 --> 00:23:57.000 align:start position:0%
to remind those of us who've been on the
 
00:23:58.430 --> 00:23:58.440 align:start position:0%
committee for a long time time that
 
00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:01.720 align:start position:0%
there is a cigar bar a
 
00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:05.190 align:start position:0%
there is a cigar bar a
cigar

00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:05.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:08.720 align:start position:0%
group very active in talking with us a
 
00:24:13.710 --> 00:24:13.720 align:start position:0%
number of years ago and that they aren't
 
00:24:16.669 --> 00:24:16.679 align:start position:0%
here and it might have been useful if
 
00:24:20.909 --> 00:24:20.919 align:start position:0%
unless you're here for them uh uh to
 
00:24:23.950 --> 00:24:23.960 align:start position:0%
have their perspective but also we don't
 
00:24:27.149 --> 00:24:27.159 align:start position:0%
have the Liquor Commission here unless
 
00:24:28.909 --> 00:24:28.919 align:start position:0%
the woman who I know at the Commerce
 
00:24:30.789 --> 00:24:30.799 align:start position:0%
Committee representative they someone
 
00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
from the I believe was some enforcement
 
00:24:34.350 --> 00:24:34.360 align:start position:0%
people they had some concerns about the
 
00:24:37.789 --> 00:24:37.799 align:start position:0%
bill as written there there if I could
 
00:24:41.310 --> 00:24:41.320 align:start position:0%
just finish this uh there are two things
 
00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:44.480 align:start position:0%
in the fiscal note that are well three
 
00:24:47.430 --> 00:24:47.440 align:start position:0%
of them that are still valid
 
00:24:51.789 --> 00:24:51.799 align:start position:0%
uh on but the addition one of them is
 
00:24:53.789 --> 00:24:53.799 align:start position:0%
their concern about monitoring
 
00:24:55.909 --> 00:24:55.919 align:start position:0%
additional licenses with the idea that
 
00:24:57.830 --> 00:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
there would be a lot more cigar bars
 
00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:00.600 align:start position:0%
which doesn't seem terribly likely
 
00:25:05.149 --> 00:25:05.159 align:start position:0%
actually uh the other one is that they
 
00:25:08.110 --> 00:25:08.120 align:start position:0%
worry that
 
00:25:11.590 --> 00:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
reducing um the percentage of revenue
 
00:25:13.510 --> 00:25:13.520 align:start position:0%
for that they have to generate from
 
00:25:17.269 --> 00:25:17.279 align:start position:0%
non-premium cigar sales which
 
00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
um including the other products in there
 
00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:24.720 align:start position:0%
would actually do still uh is likely to
 
00:25:27.510 --> 00:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
reduce tobacco related tax revenue and I
 
00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:30.640 align:start position:0%
do do not understand that statement at
 
00:25:34.909 --> 00:25:34.919 align:start position:0%
all but I think we need to learn from
 
00:25:34.919 --> 00:25:36.950 align:start position:0%
all but I think we need to learn from
them

00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:25:41.149 --> 00:25:41.159 align:start position:0%
both on what they're if they're going to
 
00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:42.760 align:start position:0%
have think they're going to have
 
00:25:46.510 --> 00:25:46.520 align:start position:0%
additional costs and whether the pre on
 
00:25:49.470 --> 00:25:49.480 align:start position:0%
that's a question yes that's a
 
00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
question uh because this is you're
 
00:25:53.630 --> 00:25:53.640 align:start position:0%
referring to the fiscal note from the
 
00:25:55.669 --> 00:25:55.679 align:start position:0%
from the B that is on this Bill yes I'm
 
00:25:58.310 --> 00:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
trying to interpret it as under the
 
00:25:58.320 --> 00:25:59.350 align:start position:0%
trying to interpret it as under the
current

00:25:59.350 --> 00:25:59.360 align:start position:0%
current
 
00:26:01.549 --> 00:26:01.559 align:start position:0%
situation I I'm not sure what I can't
 
00:26:03.230 --> 00:26:03.240 align:start position:0%
speak for the gler commission if they're
 
00:26:06.029 --> 00:26:06.039 align:start position:0%
not here here I mean I I understand it
 
00:26:08.029 --> 00:26:08.039 align:start position:0%
does look a little bit strange to be
 
00:26:09.470 --> 00:26:09.480 align:start position:0%
honest with you rep I would agree with
 
00:26:11.909 --> 00:26:11.919 align:start position:0%
you and I would say probably I would
 
00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
suggest you contact somebody from The
 
00:26:15.669 --> 00:26:15.679 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission and ask them about it
 
00:26:18.029 --> 00:26:18.039 align:start position:0%
and maybe yeah I think we have to have
 
00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:20.720 align:start position:0%
them get their testimony from it if you
 
00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:22.640 align:start position:0%
are you are concerned as well as of
 
00:26:24.430 --> 00:26:24.440 align:start position:0%
course we you need it the committee
 
00:26:26.269 --> 00:26:26.279 align:start position:0%
needs an updated fiscal note which is
 
00:26:29.990 --> 00:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
very important um as for the trade group
 
00:26:31.510 --> 00:26:31.520 align:start position:0%
I don't know why they weren't at the
 
00:26:33.149 --> 00:26:33.159 align:start position:0%
Commerce Committee hearing and they knew
 
00:26:35.789 --> 00:26:35.799 align:start position:0%
about this bill and I so I can't speak
 
00:26:38.110 --> 00:26:38.120 align:start position:0%
to it I'm
 
00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:44.200 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chairman uh thank you
 
00:26:46.870 --> 00:26:46.880 align:start position:0%
for coming to see us today um I I went
 
00:26:49.909 --> 00:26:49.919 align:start position:0%
back and looked uh last year HB 171
 
00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:52.440 align:start position:0%
passed that allows for food service
 
00:26:55.630 --> 00:26:55.640 align:start position:0%
inside a cigar bar but not sales so
 
00:26:58.110 --> 00:26:58.120 align:start position:0%
that's sort of setups like the Billiards
 
00:27:00.269 --> 00:27:00.279 align:start position:0%
Halls are where they can sell alcohol
 
00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
and you can come and play Billiards if
 
00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
they have so many tables but they'll
 
00:27:07.149 --> 00:27:07.159 align:start position:0%
allow you to order food to be brought in
 
00:27:08.950 --> 00:27:08.960 align:start position:0%
uh so that you know if you had a little
 
00:27:12.310 --> 00:27:12.320 align:start position:0%
bit you can have some food uh but um
 
00:27:14.149 --> 00:27:14.159 align:start position:0%
having that food service available are
 
00:27:15.430 --> 00:27:15.440 align:start position:0%
we just saying that we're going to be
 
00:27:17.389 --> 00:27:17.399 align:start position:0%
opening up smoking restaurants is that
 
00:27:19.950 --> 00:27:19.960 align:start position:0%
what this is because if you add
 
00:27:22.190 --> 00:27:22.200 align:start position:0%
cigarettes and you add loose tobacco and
 
00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:24.840 align:start position:0%
you have cigars and there's food service
 
00:27:27.190 --> 00:27:27.200 align:start position:0%
Avail available where basically in my
 
00:27:29.630 --> 00:27:29.640 align:start position:0%
mind saying we're opening up smoking
 
00:27:32.470 --> 00:27:32.480 align:start position:0%
restaurants uh thank
 
00:27:34.909 --> 00:27:34.919 align:start position:0%
you okay and thank you representative
 
00:27:37.149 --> 00:27:37.159 align:start position:0%
for the question is not my intent in
 
00:27:39.389 --> 00:27:39.399 align:start position:0%
filing this bill to open up a lot of
 
00:27:40.990 --> 00:27:41.000 align:start position:0%
restaurants to smoking because I think
 
00:27:43.549 --> 00:27:43.559 align:start position:0%
we had that debate some time ago and I
 
00:27:45.509 --> 00:27:45.519 align:start position:0%
think we decided that we would ban
 
00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
smoking in in in restaurants per se but
 
00:27:51.509 --> 00:27:51.519 align:start position:0%
bars and cigar are sort of was a is a
 
00:27:53.950 --> 00:27:53.960 align:start position:0%
different category and but my intent was
 
00:27:56.389 --> 00:27:56.399 align:start position:0%
not to open up food sales in all
 
00:27:58.269 --> 00:27:58.279 align:start position:0%
restaurants you know just to make that
 
00:28:00.750 --> 00:28:00.760 align:start position:0%
clear thank you may I continue with that
 
00:28:04.269 --> 00:28:04.279 align:start position:0%
thought this bill is narrow and focus to
 
00:28:06.669 --> 00:28:06.679 align:start position:0%
the qualifying to enable the qualifying
 
00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
for the license for the two or three of
 
00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:12.480 align:start position:0%
those establishments were close but no
 
00:28:15.389 --> 00:28:15.399 align:start position:0%
cigar pardon the pun in making the
 
00:28:18.070 --> 00:28:18.080 align:start position:0%
qualification and as we heard from the
 
00:28:19.990 --> 00:28:20.000 align:start position:0%
other representative on
 
00:28:24.669 --> 00:28:24.679 align:start position:0%
178 uh no um cigarettes or or food well
 
00:28:27.470 --> 00:28:27.480 align:start position:0%
um the food is opened up now and it's
 
00:28:28.990 --> 00:28:29.000 align:start position:0%
probably a good practice where you're
 
00:28:32.430 --> 00:28:32.440 align:start position:0%
serving alcohol to uh have some snacks
 
00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:35.640 align:start position:0%
or food there even insurance companies
 
00:28:40.509 --> 00:28:40.519 align:start position:0%
recognize that in covering um bars and U
 
00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:43.200 align:start position:0%
and drram shops and so forth to require
 
00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:45.360 align:start position:0%
certain amount of availability for food
 
00:28:48.389 --> 00:28:48.399 align:start position:0%
or snacks but to the point of your
 
00:28:51.269 --> 00:28:51.279 align:start position:0%
question uh this does not extend and
 
00:28:54.669 --> 00:28:54.679 align:start position:0%
overlap into uh public areas restaurants
 
00:29:03.310 --> 00:29:03.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:06.640 align:start position:0%
thank thank you um at first on the uh
 
00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
smoking of
 
00:29:10.590 --> 00:29:10.600 align:start position:0%
cigarettes uh it's smoking of cigarettes
 
00:29:13.870 --> 00:29:13.880 align:start position:0%
that's prohibited not the sale of
 
00:29:17.470 --> 00:29:17.480 align:start position:0%
cigarettes so this has some meaning this
 
00:29:20.830 --> 00:29:20.840 align:start position:0%
phrase here uh as counting cigarettes
 
00:29:24.149 --> 00:29:24.159 align:start position:0%
because cigarettes could be sold in a
 
00:29:26.430 --> 00:29:26.440 align:start position:0%
cigar bar just as long as they're in a
 
00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:28.110 align:start position:0%
cigar bar just as long as they're in a
package

00:29:28.110 --> 00:29:28.120 align:start position:0%
package
 
00:29:31.990 --> 00:29:32.000 align:start position:0%
yes um thank you um that that is the
 
00:29:34.470 --> 00:29:34.480 align:start position:0%
enabling part of this to open it up to
 
00:29:36.389 --> 00:29:36.399 align:start position:0%
the cigarettes and loose tobacco pipe
 
00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:38.720 align:start position:0%
tobacco as well right but there was some
 
00:29:42.029 --> 00:29:42.039 align:start position:0%
under some misapprehension I think in
 
00:29:44.070 --> 00:29:44.080 align:start position:0%
the prior discussion
 
00:29:47.630 --> 00:29:47.640 align:start position:0%
about uh the prohibition on smoking of
 
00:29:49.549 --> 00:29:49.559 align:start position:0%
cigarettes that's all it is it's a
 
00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:51.720 align:start position:0%
Prohibition on smoking not on sale of
 
00:29:55.190 --> 00:29:55.200 align:start position:0%
cigarettes just to be clear uh and then
 
00:29:59.070 --> 00:29:59.080 align:start position:0%
I I wonder uh if commer didn't do some
 
00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:00.240 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
00:30:02.870 --> 00:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
analysis uh to ACC company their switch
 
00:30:06.430 --> 00:30:06.440 align:start position:0%
over from a movement from the 60% to the
 
00:30:10.549 --> 00:30:10.559 align:start position:0%
30% that was in your original Bill to
 
00:30:13.509 --> 00:30:13.519 align:start position:0%
these uh additional Revenue sources that
 
00:30:17.430 --> 00:30:17.440 align:start position:0%
would be uh counted into the calculation
 
00:30:19.750 --> 00:30:19.760 align:start position:0%
and uh you know that would help a lot of
 
00:30:22.990 --> 00:30:23.000 align:start position:0%
some Anal analysis was done they they
 
00:30:27.549 --> 00:30:27.559 align:start position:0%
saw a tradeoff apparently and um was
 
00:30:29.789 --> 00:30:29.799 align:start position:0%
there any math behind
 
00:30:33.870 --> 00:30:33.880 align:start position:0%
that I I was surprised as representative
 
00:30:38.350 --> 00:30:38.360 align:start position:0%
cloer was at the outcome from um the
 
00:30:41.029 --> 00:30:41.039 align:start position:0%
department I would have thought that uh
 
00:30:42.789 --> 00:30:42.799 align:start position:0%
maybe if they would have considered the
 
00:30:44.710 --> 00:30:44.720 align:start position:0%
50% or
 
00:30:47.230 --> 00:30:47.240 align:start position:0%
45% uh then that would have done the
 
00:30:50.149 --> 00:30:50.159 align:start position:0%
same thing but uh I'm sure they studied
 
00:30:52.950 --> 00:30:52.960 align:start position:0%
it and uh and maybe realized that they
 
00:30:54.669 --> 00:30:54.679 align:start position:0%
could attain the same goal with
 
00:30:57.710 --> 00:30:57.720 align:start position:0%
expanding to cigarettes and pipe tobacco
 
00:30:59.750 --> 00:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
that's my assumption I can't speak to
 
00:31:01.950 --> 00:31:01.960 align:start position:0%
that beyond my assumption and an
 
00:31:03.590 --> 00:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
additional information there was a
 
00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:05.360 align:start position:0%
proposal one member of the Commerce
 
00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
Committee wanted to amend the bill to
 
00:31:09.470 --> 00:31:09.480 align:start position:0%
make it 50% but in the end the rest of
 
00:31:10.990 --> 00:31:11.000 align:start position:0%
the committee did not want to go along
 
00:31:12.909 --> 00:31:12.919 align:start position:0%
with that but I think representative you
 
00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:15.720 align:start position:0%
raay a a you and the other
 
00:31:16.950 --> 00:31:16.960 align:start position:0%
Representatives have raised serious
 
00:31:19.269 --> 00:31:19.279 align:start position:0%
points you can would sell this allow the
 
00:31:20.909 --> 00:31:20.919 align:start position:0%
sale of cigarettes but I guess if you
 
00:31:23.549 --> 00:31:23.559 align:start position:0%
can't smoke cigarettes in a cigar bar I
 
00:31:26.190 --> 00:31:26.200 align:start position:0%
don't know I'll admit it doesn't make
 
00:31:28.029 --> 00:31:28.039 align:start position:0%
much sense to me and I I can't I don't
 
00:31:29.789 --> 00:31:29.799 align:start position:0%
if anybody from Commerce is here I don't
 
00:31:32.509 --> 00:31:32.519 align:start position:0%
know what their intent they were
 
00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:34.480 align:start position:0%
thinking but yeah it's something and
 
00:31:37.830 --> 00:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
maybe it's not a the a purview of your
 
00:31:39.070 --> 00:31:39.080 align:start position:0%
committee I know you're dealing more
 
00:31:41.870 --> 00:31:41.880 align:start position:0%
with Revenue to to deal with this issue
 
00:31:44.269 --> 00:31:44.279 align:start position:0%
but you know it does uh it's bit
 
00:31:45.950 --> 00:31:45.960 align:start position:0%
inconsistent just one other comment if I
 
00:31:50.470 --> 00:31:50.480 align:start position:0%
may follow up it's uh that on liquor is
 
00:31:54.029 --> 00:31:54.039 align:start position:0%
the other way around you can sell liquor
 
00:31:56.149 --> 00:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
for consumption on the
 
00:31:59.909 --> 00:31:59.919 align:start position:0%
premises but you can't sell liquor
 
00:32:02.830 --> 00:32:02.840 align:start position:0%
otherwise um and now on cigarettes
 
00:32:05.350 --> 00:32:05.360 align:start position:0%
there's a Prohibition on smoking
 
00:32:07.750 --> 00:32:07.760 align:start position:0%
cigarettes in the establishment but but
 
00:32:10.430 --> 00:32:10.440 align:start position:0%
there under current law apparently is no
 
00:32:13.830 --> 00:32:13.840 align:start position:0%
prohibition on selling
 
00:32:19.070 --> 00:32:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:22.029 --> 00:32:22.039 align:start position:0%
figure well once again I I think that we
 
00:32:24.990 --> 00:32:25.000 align:start position:0%
need a technical fix on 178 and any
 
00:32:27.950 --> 00:32:27.960 align:start position:0%
other place in the law where we conflict
 
00:32:30.629 --> 00:32:30.639 align:start position:0%
of uh intent against uh current
 
00:32:33.070 --> 00:32:33.080 align:start position:0%
statutory provision I mean smoke is
 
00:32:35.230 --> 00:32:35.240 align:start position:0%
smoke if you're going to have a pipe a
 
00:32:38.350 --> 00:32:38.360 align:start position:0%
cigar or a cigarette you're going to be
 
00:32:41.230 --> 00:32:41.240 align:start position:0%
breathing smoke um or enjoying smoke
 
00:32:43.909 --> 00:32:43.919 align:start position:0%
however your outlook is and uh so I
 
00:32:46.190 --> 00:32:46.200 align:start position:0%
think the bill is valid but we need a
 
00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
technical fix where there might be some
 
00:32:50.389 --> 00:32:50.399 align:start position:0%
conflict with other
 
00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
statute representative spelsbury thank
 
00:32:57.350 --> 00:32:57.360 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman um this is confusing
 
00:32:59.629 --> 00:32:59.639 align:start position:0%
without the clarification of why the
 
00:33:01.269 --> 00:33:01.279 align:start position:0%
Commerce Committee ultimately did what
 
00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
they did but from a revenue
 
00:33:06.750 --> 00:33:06.760 align:start position:0%
perspective isn't uh a pack of
 
00:33:09.629 --> 00:33:09.639 align:start position:0%
cigarettes taxed at the same amount
 
00:33:12.990 --> 00:33:13.000 align:start position:0%
regardless of where it's sold and so
 
00:33:18.110 --> 00:33:18.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:21.230 --> 00:33:21.240 align:start position:0%
state uh it's it's it's possible but the
 
00:33:23.830 --> 00:33:23.840 align:start position:0%
assumption is that more cigarettes would
 
00:33:26.190 --> 00:33:26.200 align:start position:0%
the sale of cigarettes would increase if
 
00:33:27.909 --> 00:33:27.919 align:start position:0%
they you're allowed to be sold in cigar
 
00:33:31.029 --> 00:33:31.039 align:start position:0%
bars I think that's the intent I mean I
 
00:33:33.549 --> 00:33:33.559 align:start position:0%
um but it's possible that the revenue
 
00:33:35.430 --> 00:33:35.440 align:start position:0%
could stay the same as you seem to be
 
00:33:37.389 --> 00:33:37.399 align:start position:0%
implying there could even be an increase
 
00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:42.240 align:start position:0%
of tobacco tax revenue but I doubt it's
 
00:33:46.590 --> 00:33:46.600 align:start position:0%
material I I think that um this is
 
00:33:49.149 --> 00:33:49.159 align:start position:0%
trying to enable a business to make it
 
00:33:51.149 --> 00:33:51.159 align:start position:0%
in a tough environment and those two or
 
00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
three having problems with the threshold
 
00:33:57.149 --> 00:33:57.159 align:start position:0%
it's so it's a business orientation Aid
 
00:33:59.710 --> 00:33:59.720 align:start position:0%
um as well as providing a place uh where
 
00:34:02.470 --> 00:34:02.480 align:start position:0%
smokers can congregate to have company
 
00:34:05.789 --> 00:34:05.799 align:start position:0%
and enjoy what they like to do I gave up
 
00:34:08.629 --> 00:34:08.639 align:start position:0%
smoking 40 years ago but I understand
 
00:34:12.149 --> 00:34:12.159 align:start position:0%
the U Affinity to uh wanting to collect
 
00:34:14.389 --> 00:34:14.399 align:start position:0%
in a in a friendly environment have a
 
00:34:15.790 --> 00:34:15.800 align:start position:0%
drink have a
 
00:34:19.470 --> 00:34:19.480 align:start position:0%
smoke okay we have some things to Maul
 
00:34:21.510 --> 00:34:21.520 align:start position:0%
over to
 
00:34:24.629 --> 00:34:24.639 align:start position:0%
clarify uh any other questions for these
 
00:34:27.710 --> 00:34:27.720 align:start position:0%
two because we do have one of the card
 
00:34:30.109 --> 00:34:30.119 align:start position:0%
represent L quick question or at least I
 
00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:32.240 align:start position:0%
hope it is so I'm trying to wrap my head
 
00:34:33.669 --> 00:34:33.679 align:start position:0%
like representative Aly I don't
 
00:34:35.470 --> 00:34:35.480 align:start position:0%
understand the fiscal note about the
 
00:34:38.750 --> 00:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
reduction but um in in tax revenue but I
 
00:34:40.389 --> 00:34:40.399 align:start position:0%
guess my question for you is the goal
 
00:34:43.069 --> 00:34:43.079 align:start position:0%
here it seems like is pretty simple it's
 
00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:44.760 align:start position:0%
adding a new Revenue stream that they
 
00:34:46.270 --> 00:34:46.280 align:start position:0%
could use to get the
 
00:34:49.589 --> 00:34:49.599 align:start position:0%
60% and in theory if you add new Revenue
 
00:34:51.710 --> 00:34:51.720 align:start position:0%
there's gross new gross revenue which
 
00:34:53.710 --> 00:34:53.720 align:start position:0%
changes the percentage under the 40%
 
00:34:55.030 --> 00:34:55.040 align:start position:0%
that we haven't talked about that they
 
00:34:56.550 --> 00:34:56.560 align:start position:0%
could sell it increased liquor now
 
00:34:57.710 --> 00:34:57.720 align:start position:0%
because the the numbers bigger the
 
00:34:58.990 --> 00:34:59.000 align:start position:0%
percentages are bigger they could sell
 
00:35:01.430 --> 00:35:01.440 align:start position:0%
more without violating is that the goal
 
00:35:02.990 --> 00:35:03.000 align:start position:0%
is just to help businesses either
 
00:35:05.630 --> 00:35:05.640 align:start position:0%
generate more Revenue um and and thus
 
00:35:07.510 --> 00:35:07.520 align:start position:0%
we're talking about you know especially
 
00:35:09.069 --> 00:35:09.079 align:start position:0%
loose tobacco and cigarettes and we're
 
00:35:10.950 --> 00:35:10.960 align:start position:0%
talking about uh liquor that we're also
 
00:35:12.589 --> 00:35:12.599 align:start position:0%
increasing the revenue on that side as
 
00:35:14.349 --> 00:35:14.359 align:start position:0%
well for the state is that was that the
 
00:35:16.910 --> 00:35:16.920 align:start position:0%
goal was has two two components to this
 
00:35:18.430 --> 00:35:18.440 align:start position:0%
was the purposes and I'm more addressing
 
00:35:20.550 --> 00:35:20.560 align:start position:0%
because of your your as your committee
 
00:35:22.230 --> 00:35:22.240 align:start position:0%
what's your is revenue yes so the one of
 
00:35:23.910 --> 00:35:23.920 align:start position:0%
the goals was to increase the revenue of
 
00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
course for there are other issues but
 
00:35:27.390 --> 00:35:27.400 align:start position:0%
goals as well which we talked about in
 
00:35:30.670 --> 00:35:30.680 align:start position:0%
Commerce so thank you increase Revenue
 
00:35:34.630 --> 00:35:34.640 align:start position:0%
y represent Aaron thank you Mr chair and
 
00:35:36.990 --> 00:35:37.000 align:start position:0%
thank you representative cluer for
 
00:35:41.190 --> 00:35:41.200 align:start position:0%
taking my question so C can you tell me
 
00:35:44.069 --> 00:35:44.079 align:start position:0%
what was the um
 
00:35:48.430 --> 00:35:48.440 align:start position:0%
objection to lowering the 60% um
 
00:35:51.430 --> 00:35:51.440 align:start position:0%
threshold from the Commerce Committee do
 
00:35:52.829 --> 00:35:52.839 align:start position:0%
do you recall
 
00:35:55.510 --> 00:35:55.520 align:start position:0%
that I I think one of their concerns
 
00:35:59.309 --> 00:35:59.319 align:start position:0%
that they and Frank they thought overall
 
00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:00.640 align:start position:0%
I think the majority of the Commerce
 
00:36:03.109 --> 00:36:03.119 align:start position:0%
Committee thought the present law was
 
00:36:05.870 --> 00:36:05.880 align:start position:0%
working uh and I I can't I mean I know
 
00:36:07.349 --> 00:36:07.359 align:start position:0%
the chairman of the committee was one of
 
00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:11.680 align:start position:0%
the Prime sponsors of the of the 2009
 
00:36:13.510 --> 00:36:13.520 align:start position:0%
law and I think he thinks it's working
 
00:36:15.750 --> 00:36:15.760 align:start position:0%
and I see his point they also didn't
 
00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:17.200 align:start position:0%
like the fact it was only going to be
 
00:36:18.990 --> 00:36:19.000 align:start position:0%
for two years it was going to be a
 
00:36:21.990 --> 00:36:22.000 align:start position:0%
temporary trial uh and I think those are
 
00:36:25.030 --> 00:36:25.040 align:start position:0%
the main objections that they had to the
 
00:36:27.309 --> 00:36:27.319 align:start position:0%
bill the way I submitted it the original
 
00:36:28.550 --> 00:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
version thank you I don't know if that
 
00:36:32.109 --> 00:36:32.119 align:start position:0%
helps any further questions not thank
 
00:36:34.790 --> 00:36:34.800 align:start position:0%

00:36:41.030 --> 00:36:41.040 align:start position:0%

Association of New Hampshire which is
 
00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:12.640 align:start position:0%
primarily uh a group of five owners who
 
00:37:15.630 --> 00:37:15.640 align:start position:0%
between them have about a dozen retail
 
00:37:17.390 --> 00:37:17.400 align:start position:0%
cigar shops in the state of New
 
00:37:20.309 --> 00:37:20.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire among those four of them have
 
00:37:22.950 --> 00:37:22.960 align:start position:0%
a cigar bar license out of the roughly
 
00:37:25.950 --> 00:37:25.960 align:start position:0%
dozen Cigar Bar licenses in the state
 
00:37:28.230 --> 00:37:28.240 align:start position:0%
and Mr chair hop to provide a little bit
 
00:37:30.550 --> 00:37:30.560 align:start position:0%
of clarity on at least a couple of
 
00:37:32.430 --> 00:37:32.440 align:start position:0%
points one of which has been touched on
 
00:37:34.470 --> 00:37:34.480 align:start position:0%
touched on represent hacken Phillips
 
00:37:36.589 --> 00:37:36.599 align:start position:0%
representative Ames more recently about
 
00:37:38.430 --> 00:37:38.440 align:start position:0%
the second part of the statute that's
 
00:37:40.349 --> 00:37:40.359 align:start position:0%
relevant um but first I'd like to
 
00:37:42.309 --> 00:37:42.319 align:start position:0%
address representative nunes's uh
 
00:37:44.109 --> 00:37:44.119 align:start position:0%
question about the service of food just
 
00:37:48.430 --> 00:37:48.440 align:start position:0%
to make sure we everybody understands um
 
00:37:51.069 --> 00:37:51.079 align:start position:0%
the previous statute before the the
 
00:37:53.349 --> 00:37:53.359 align:start position:0%
referen legislation was passed
 
00:37:57.109 --> 00:37:57.119 align:start position:0%
prohibited the service of food so so a
 
00:37:59.870 --> 00:37:59.880 align:start position:0%
cigar bar could not simply just put you
 
00:38:02.470 --> 00:38:02.480 align:start position:0%
know the traditional bar snacks on the
 
00:38:05.150 --> 00:38:05.160 align:start position:0%
bar and I think represent nunas or
 
00:38:06.670 --> 00:38:06.680 align:start position:0%
somebody referenced it's a probably a
 
00:38:08.430 --> 00:38:08.440 align:start position:0%
good idea if you're enjoying an adult
 
00:38:09.670 --> 00:38:09.680 align:start position:0%
beverage to have something in your
 
00:38:11.950 --> 00:38:11.960 align:start position:0%
stomach and that was the premise the
 
00:38:14.150 --> 00:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
legislation changed one word in the
 
00:38:16.990 --> 00:38:17.000 align:start position:0%
statute it changed service to sale so
 
00:38:18.950 --> 00:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
the sale of food is prohibited within
 
00:38:21.430 --> 00:38:21.440 align:start position:0%
the cigar bar but the service of food
 
00:38:24.470 --> 00:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
free snacks uh is allowed um that was a
 
00:38:26.230 --> 00:38:26.240 align:start position:0%
very simple change under a very simple
 
00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:27.630 align:start position:0%
very simple change under a very simple
premise

00:38:27.630 --> 00:38:27.640 align:start position:0%
premise
 
00:38:30.870 --> 00:38:30.880 align:start position:0%
um and now I I'd like to back up to at
 
00:38:32.790 --> 00:38:32.800 align:start position:0%
the very beginning of the statute the
 
00:38:34.510 --> 00:38:34.520 align:start position:0%
sort of the philosophy around the
 
00:38:38.190 --> 00:38:38.200 align:start position:0%
statute um it was put in place under the
 
00:38:40.710 --> 00:38:40.720 align:start position:0%
understanding that a cigar bar would
 
00:38:43.550 --> 00:38:43.560 align:start position:0%
first and foremost be a retail cigar
 
00:38:45.430 --> 00:38:45.440 align:start position:0%
shop you're a shop first and then you
 
00:38:48.069 --> 00:38:48.079 align:start position:0%
get your bar license not the other way
 
00:38:51.670 --> 00:38:51.680 align:start position:0%
around and I believe the um the
 
00:38:54.470 --> 00:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
philosophy at the time was similar to
 
00:38:56.750 --> 00:38:56.760 align:start position:0%
liquor licenses in establishments that
 
00:38:59.069 --> 00:38:59.079 align:start position:0%
serve food there was a minimum
 
00:39:01.309 --> 00:39:01.319 align:start position:0%
requirement that you had to do other
 
00:39:03.190 --> 00:39:03.200 align:start position:0%
things for a restaurant in order to have
 
00:39:04.910 --> 00:39:04.920 align:start position:0%
a barer license you have to have a
 
00:39:08.030 --> 00:39:08.040 align:start position:0%
certain percentage of your um Revenue
 
00:39:11.510 --> 00:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
stream as food similarly the statute
 
00:39:14.950 --> 00:39:14.960 align:start position:0%
currently is 60% is the sale of cigars
 
00:39:19.550 --> 00:39:19.560 align:start position:0%
and humidors and related U items so I
 
00:39:21.550 --> 00:39:21.560 align:start position:0%
want to make it clear please uh that the
 
00:39:23.470 --> 00:39:23.480 align:start position:0%
folks that I represent um have no
 
00:39:26.109 --> 00:39:26.119 align:start position:0%
position on this bill either as amended
 
00:39:28.030 --> 00:39:28.040 align:start position:0%
by the house proposed by the Commerce
 
00:39:31.309 --> 00:39:31.319 align:start position:0%
Committee or is introduced um the folks
 
00:39:33.309 --> 00:39:33.319 align:start position:0%
are operating fine under the under the
 
00:39:37.630 --> 00:39:37.640 align:start position:0%
current statute um I'm not aware of any
 
00:39:39.550 --> 00:39:39.560 align:start position:0%
current problems in fact I am aware that
 
00:39:41.750 --> 00:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
the Liquor Commission can confirm this
 
00:39:43.710 --> 00:39:43.720 align:start position:0%
um there's a new licy license
 
00:39:46.109 --> 00:39:46.119 align:start position:0%
application for a cigar bar in Littleton
 
00:39:50.470 --> 00:39:50.480 align:start position:0%
um so some of them are growing um so I
 
00:39:52.470 --> 00:39:52.480 align:start position:0%
just had hoped to to provide some some
 
00:39:54.870 --> 00:39:54.880 align:start position:0%
clarity Mr chair uh and I can answer
 
00:39:56.470 --> 00:39:56.480 align:start position:0%
questions to the best of my ability but
 
00:39:59.069 --> 00:39:59.079 align:start position:0%
you know uh the association has no
 
00:40:00.950 --> 00:40:00.960 align:start position:0%
position on the bill as as currently
 
00:40:03.309 --> 00:40:03.319 align:start position:0%
before you um I'm not sure that that
 
00:40:04.990 --> 00:40:05.000 align:start position:0%
would be the case if there were a move
 
00:40:07.950 --> 00:40:07.960 align:start position:0%
to um eliminate that prohibition on
 
00:40:10.150 --> 00:40:10.160 align:start position:0%
smoking which was the the the other
 
00:40:13.190 --> 00:40:13.200 align:start position:0%
piece the the statute is specific um the
 
00:40:15.950 --> 00:40:15.960 align:start position:0%
exception to the Endor smoking act for
 
00:40:18.069 --> 00:40:18.079 align:start position:0%
cigar bars is for cigars only currently
 
00:40:20.190 --> 00:40:20.200 align:start position:0%
in the statute um and you know I'd have
 
00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
to asked them if they had an opinion if
 
00:40:24.230 --> 00:40:24.240 align:start position:0%
if there was a move to to eliminate that
 
00:40:27.710 --> 00:40:27.720 align:start position:0%
prohibition as well so thank you
 
00:40:30.230 --> 00:40:30.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony uh
 
00:40:33.829 --> 00:40:33.839 align:start position:0%
questions representative Bry so from you
 
00:40:35.230 --> 00:40:35.240 align:start position:0%
U thank you thank you chair thank you
 
00:40:37.270 --> 00:40:37.280 align:start position:0%
for your testimony glad you're here
 
00:40:42.069 --> 00:40:42.079 align:start position:0%
actually um so the way I read this is
 
00:40:44.750 --> 00:40:44.760 align:start position:0%
that this is just a way to get hit help
 
00:40:48.829 --> 00:40:48.839 align:start position:0%
hit the 60% I mean I I don't see it as
 
00:40:50.589 --> 00:40:50.599 align:start position:0%
wanting to generate more revenue for the
 
00:40:52.069 --> 00:40:52.079 align:start position:0%
state or anything like that I don't I
 
00:40:54.430 --> 00:40:54.440 align:start position:0%
don't see that I mean is is that your
 
00:40:55.990 --> 00:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
what is your take on this is it really
 
00:40:57.870 --> 00:40:57.880 align:start position:0%
helping them to hit the 60% and number
 
00:41:00.270 --> 00:41:00.280 align:start position:0%
one and number two your four clients or
 
00:41:02.069 --> 00:41:02.079 align:start position:0%
your your
 
00:41:04.510 --> 00:41:04.520 align:start position:0%
Association is this an issue for them
 
00:41:06.910 --> 00:41:06.920 align:start position:0%
hitting the 60% to answer the the second
 
00:41:10.069 --> 00:41:10.079 align:start position:0%
question first no it's not um and the
 
00:41:11.589 --> 00:41:11.599 align:start position:0%
the the first question my observation
 
00:41:13.430 --> 00:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
and following the Commerce Committee
 
00:41:16.470 --> 00:41:16.480 align:start position:0%
proceedings was that that statement is
 
00:41:20.510 --> 00:41:20.520 align:start position:0%
accurate uh there were a minimum number
 
00:41:23.230 --> 00:41:23.240 align:start position:0%
of establishments I'm not sure if the
 
00:41:25.790 --> 00:41:25.800 align:start position:0%
one or two that were at issue are still
 
00:41:26.829 --> 00:41:26.839 align:start position:0%
in business
 
00:41:28.270 --> 00:41:28.280 align:start position:0%
um The Liquor Commission would would
 
00:41:30.750 --> 00:41:30.760 align:start position:0%
have that information
 
00:41:34.790 --> 00:41:34.800 align:start position:0%
um hitting the 60% again my observing
 
00:41:36.270 --> 00:41:36.280 align:start position:0%
the the Commerce Committee proceedings
 
00:41:39.870 --> 00:41:39.880 align:start position:0%
hitting the 60% was the issue and
 
00:41:42.470 --> 00:41:42.480 align:start position:0%
allowing the sale of other items other
 
00:41:44.950 --> 00:41:44.960 align:start position:0%
the tobacco type items to count towards
 
00:41:47.630 --> 00:41:47.640 align:start position:0%
the 60% was the goal I don't recall
 
00:41:49.630 --> 00:41:49.640 align:start position:0%
Revenue being part of the discussion you
 
00:41:52.109 --> 00:41:52.119 align:start position:0%
know and I just may not have may not be
 
00:41:55.790 --> 00:41:55.800 align:start position:0%
recalling it follow up follow up so the
 
00:41:56.750 --> 00:41:56.760 align:start position:0%
in the four
 
00:41:59.750 --> 00:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
40% what is what makes up the 40% it's
 
00:42:01.829 --> 00:42:01.839 align:start position:0%
basically alcohol s yes sir yeah that
 
00:42:04.030 --> 00:42:04.040 align:start position:0%
that's the balance correct it's nothing
 
00:42:05.950 --> 00:42:05.960 align:start position:0%
else to your knowledge basically the
 
00:42:07.589 --> 00:42:07.599 align:start position:0%
alcohol part okay so the liquor
 
00:42:07.599 --> 00:42:09.470 align:start position:0%
alcohol part okay so the liquor
commission's

00:42:09.470 --> 00:42:09.480 align:start position:0%
commission's
 
00:42:12.190 --> 00:42:12.200 align:start position:0%
testimony during either the hearing or a
 
00:42:15.150 --> 00:42:15.160 align:start position:0%
subcommittee was that sale of other
 
00:42:17.309 --> 00:42:17.319 align:start position:0%
you've got adult beverages then you have
 
00:42:19.150 --> 00:42:19.160 align:start position:0%
Cigar and cigar related sale of anything
 
00:42:21.270 --> 00:42:21.280 align:start position:0%
else counted actually against the 60%
 
00:42:23.950 --> 00:42:23.960 align:start position:0%
for what it's wor one follow so who
 
00:42:26.829 --> 00:42:26.839 align:start position:0%
testified from L was it abanian uh it
 
00:42:29.790 --> 00:42:29.800 align:start position:0%
was Chief armaganian and um there was
 
00:42:31.470 --> 00:42:31.480 align:start position:0%
another person along with I think the
 
00:42:33.630 --> 00:42:33.640 align:start position:0%
chief um one of the other enforcement
 
00:42:35.670 --> 00:42:35.680 align:start position:0%
people I'm okay if you mention a name I
 
00:42:37.390 --> 00:42:37.400 align:start position:0%

the committee and uh I think it's very
 
00:42:59.309 --> 00:42:59.319 align:start position:0%
different for your or four who are quite
 
00:43:02.349 --> 00:43:02.359 align:start position:0%
uh quite heavily into the business and
 
00:43:03.790 --> 00:43:03.800 align:start position:0%
some of these others that are just
 
00:43:10.069 --> 00:43:10.079 align:start position:0%
starting up by themselves but um the the
 
00:43:14.030 --> 00:43:14.040 align:start position:0%
cigar uh retailers make most of their
 
00:43:17.470 --> 00:43:17.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:20.270 --> 00:43:20.280 align:start position:0%
internet um I'm not sure I could
 
00:43:22.990 --> 00:43:23.000 align:start position:0%
characterize each and every one of them
 
00:43:26.589 --> 00:43:26.599 align:start position:0%
um if I could list the the location
 
00:43:28.309 --> 00:43:28.319 align:start position:0%

though yes um represent
 
00:47:41.270 --> 00:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
yly why is this before our committee the
 
00:47:46.630 --> 00:47:46.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:50.430 --> 00:47:50.440 align:start position:0%
at I got two the bill there's a part in
 
00:47:53.910 --> 00:47:53.920 align:start position:0%
there that has to do with financial
 
00:47:57.390 --> 00:47:57.400 align:start position:0%
reportings and the uh which is
 
00:47:59.549 --> 00:47:59.559 align:start position:0%
responsible for the revenue Focus so I
 
00:48:03.390 --> 00:48:03.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:13.589 --> 00:48:13.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:16.109 --> 00:48:16.119 align:start position:0%
36 someone thought that we should well
 
00:48:18.270 --> 00:48:18.280 align:start position:0%
they're talking about changing the the
 
00:48:22.750 --> 00:48:22.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:28.470 --> 00:48:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:31.230 --> 00:48:31.240 align:start position:0%
chair I'm I'm a little confused does a
 
00:48:33.190 --> 00:48:33.200 align:start position:0%
revolving fund already
 
00:48:38.309 --> 00:48:38.319 align:start position:0%
exist it does yes it has a cap
 
00:48:42.750 --> 00:48:42.760 align:start position:0%
so this would then just be a uh cost of
 
00:48:45.349 --> 00:48:45.359 align:start position:0%
living increase if you would if you will
 
00:48:47.510 --> 00:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
accept that terminology is is that
 
00:48:52.030 --> 00:48:52.040 align:start position:0%
correct quite a quite a cost ofing don't
 
00:48:53.589 --> 00:48:53.599 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I appreciate it it's
 
00:48:55.950 --> 00:48:55.960 align:start position:0%
probably been around for a while Mr
 
00:48:58.750 --> 00:48:58.760 align:start position:0%
chairman represent El me I had a
 
00:49:03.829 --> 00:49:03.839 align:start position:0%
separate question about item four what I
 
00:49:07.710 --> 00:49:07.720 align:start position:0%
think was no no not about item four uh
 
00:49:11.430 --> 00:49:11.440 align:start position:0%
where have they put dedicated funds now
 
00:49:14.510 --> 00:49:14.520 align:start position:0%
that with this reorganization I couldn't
 
00:49:16.309 --> 00:49:16.319 align:start position:0%
figure out which division it was
 
00:49:18.870 --> 00:49:18.880 align:start position:0%
supposed to be
 
00:49:22.630 --> 00:49:22.640 align:start position:0%
under because that's affects us quite a
 
00:49:26.069 --> 00:49:26.079 align:start position:0%
bit right if if they put it into a
 
00:49:27.589 --> 00:49:27.599 align:start position:0%
division that
 
00:49:33.510 --> 00:49:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:36.710 --> 00:49:36.720 align:start position:0%
this obviously
 
00:49:39.750 --> 00:49:39.760 align:start position:0%
um and anybody that had anything to do
 
00:49:41.670 --> 00:49:41.680 align:start position:0%
with this
 
00:49:44.309 --> 00:49:44.319 align:start position:0%
bill isn't here
 
00:49:47.789 --> 00:49:47.799 align:start position:0%
today right so there's no concern
 
00:49:47.799 --> 00:49:50.630 align:start position:0%
today right so there's no concern
anybody

00:49:50.630 --> 00:49:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:53.990 --> 00:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
has representative BR so when you when
 
00:49:55.630 --> 00:49:55.640 align:start position:0%
you look at the two prime sponsors
 
00:49:58.870 --> 00:49:58.880 align:start position:0%
Maguire and Reagan Senator Reagan uh
 
00:50:01.710 --> 00:50:01.720 align:start position:0%
probably chairs of uh the committee that
 
00:50:04.829 --> 00:50:04.839 align:start position:0%
oversee uh Department of ad uh of
 
00:50:04.839 --> 00:50:07.549 align:start position:0%
oversee uh Department of ad uh of
administrative

00:50:07.549 --> 00:50:07.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:10.150 --> 00:50:10.160 align:start position:0%
services so to me this was a
 
00:50:13.230 --> 00:50:13.240 align:start position:0%
housekeeping bill that they submitted it
 
00:50:16.430 --> 00:50:16.440 align:start position:0%
passed the committee Edna 18 to nothing
 
00:50:19.630 --> 00:50:19.640 align:start position:0%
and was on the consent calendar the only
 
00:50:21.510 --> 00:50:21.520 align:start position:0%
thing I think before we act on it we
 
00:50:23.390 --> 00:50:23.400 align:start position:0%
just have to understand why they want to
 
00:50:26.309 --> 00:50:26.319 align:start position:0%
increase to 20,000 to 100,000 and we we
 
00:50:27.549 --> 00:50:27.559 align:start position:0%
have to find somebody who can answer
 
00:50:29.789 --> 00:50:29.799 align:start position:0%
that for us I think thank
 
00:50:32.870 --> 00:50:32.880 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman representative Aly I
 
00:50:34.470 --> 00:50:34.480 align:start position:0%
want to know what they've done with
 
00:50:37.390 --> 00:50:37.400 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds and whether they were
 
00:50:40.670 --> 00:50:40.680 align:start position:0%
thinking about it but on before we pass
 
00:50:46.309 --> 00:50:46.319 align:start position:0%
it but also on I think yeah I I went and
 
00:50:49.670 --> 00:50:49.680 align:start position:0%
last night and I looked up the RSA for
 
00:50:52.109 --> 00:50:52.119 align:start position:0%
what that fund is supposed to do could I
 
00:50:53.710 --> 00:50:53.720 align:start position:0%
read off
 
00:50:57.069 --> 00:50:57.079 align:start position:0%
what what um they're training they're
 
00:51:01.150 --> 00:51:01.160 align:start position:0%
they're supposed yes to do um they
 
00:51:03.750 --> 00:51:03.760 align:start position:0%
charge fees for this and that's why it's
 
00:51:07.349 --> 00:51:07.359 align:start position:0%
revolving but uh Municipal and state
 
00:51:10.470 --> 00:51:10.480 align:start position:0%
staff training training materials for
 
00:51:13.910 --> 00:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
those uh a program for certified public
 
00:51:16.390 --> 00:51:16.400 align:start position:0%
managers within state
 
00:51:22.150 --> 00:51:22.160 align:start position:0%
government and uh and yeah that's it but
 
00:51:23.829 --> 00:51:23.839 align:start position:0%
that's quite a lot of people that
 
00:51:25.910 --> 00:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
they're talking about that need to be
 
00:51:30.030 --> 00:51:30.040 align:start position:0%
trained and um we' we'd want to know how
 
00:51:32.829 --> 00:51:32.839 align:start position:0%
much is being lapsed every year because
 
00:51:37.710 --> 00:51:37.720 align:start position:0%
they laps at the end of the year uh I
 
00:51:39.190 --> 00:51:39.200 align:start position:0%
think it's at the end of the year they
 
00:51:41.349 --> 00:51:41.359 align:start position:0%
lapse the
 
00:51:45.670 --> 00:51:45.680 align:start position:0%
money so um they would
 
00:51:49.150 --> 00:51:49.160 align:start position:0%
not they would be operating on 20,000 a
 
00:51:54.349 --> 00:51:54.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:59.349 --> 00:51:59.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:03.670 --> 00:52:03.680 align:start position:0%
from the committee or represent Maguire
 
00:52:05.829 --> 00:52:05.839 align:start position:0%
or Senator
 
00:52:09.270 --> 00:52:09.280 align:start position:0%
Reagan uh normal procedure is if the
 
00:52:11.670 --> 00:52:11.680 align:start position:0%
bill is
 
00:52:14.470 --> 00:52:14.480 align:start position:0%
important they would at least let the
 
00:52:16.109 --> 00:52:16.119 align:start position:0%
chairman of the committee know what's
 
00:52:21.470 --> 00:52:21.480 align:start position:0%
going on so I will hold this
 
00:52:25.589 --> 00:52:25.599 align:start position:0%
bill and we not do not hear then
 
00:52:29.870 --> 00:52:29.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:32.510 --> 00:52:32.520 align:start position:0%
action so I'm not going to guess what
 
00:52:39.069 --> 00:52:39.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:42.750 --> 00:52:42.760 align:start position:0%
yeah so is anybody here to testify on
 
00:52:48.549 --> 00:52:48.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:51.589 --> 00:52:51.599 align:start position:0%
1288 and I'm closing the public hearing
 
00:52:51.599 --> 00:52:54.230 align:start position:0%
1288 and I'm closing the public hearing
on

00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:54.240 --> 00:52:57.069 align:start position:0%
 
1288

00:52:57.069 --> 00:52:57.079 align:start position:0%
1288
 
00:53:01.349 --> 00:53:01.359 align:start position:0%
so so if the clerk was so not
 
00:53:07.150 --> 00:53:07.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:09.750 --> 00:53:09.760 align:start position:0%
testify did get in introduced by
 
00:53:09.760 --> 00:53:15.470 align:start position:0%
testify did get in introduced by
representative

00:53:15.470 --> 00:53:15.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:18.150 --> 00:53:18.160 align:start position:0%
lion are we have to wait six minutes
 
00:53:24.150 --> 00:53:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:30.870 align:start position:0%
 
bill

00:53:30.870 --> 00:53:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:34.710 --> 00:53:34.720 align:start position:0%
yes and while we're waiting this
 
00:53:36.990 --> 00:53:37.000 align:start position:0%
afternoon we're going to be hearing
 
00:53:41.630 --> 00:53:41.640 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1598 which is the marijuana
 
00:53:44.870 --> 00:53:44.880 align:start position:0%
bill we we will be joined by three
 
00:53:48.390 --> 00:53:48.400 align:start position:0%
members of the finance
 
00:53:51.190 --> 00:53:51.200 align:start position:0%
committee and represented hunt who
 
00:53:53.109 --> 00:53:53.119 align:start position:0%
chairs the Commerce
 
00:53:55.710 --> 00:53:55.720 align:start position:0%
Committee has an executive session going
 
00:53:58.789 --> 00:53:58.799 align:start position:0%
on and then he then he will join us
 
00:54:01.549 --> 00:54:01.559 align:start position:0%
because the part that we're interested
 
00:54:04.349 --> 00:54:04.359 align:start position:0%
in on that bill only because the policy
 
00:54:09.829 --> 00:54:09.839 align:start position:0%
has already been set is the banking part
 
00:54:12.190 --> 00:54:12.200 align:start position:0%
and the revenue
 
00:54:15.190 --> 00:54:15.200 align:start position:0%
issues not the policy because the policy
 
00:54:18.990 --> 00:54:19.000 align:start position:0%
has been approved by the Full House to
 
00:54:23.829 --> 00:54:23.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:27.030 --> 00:54:27.040 align:start position:0%
so I can't hear
 
00:54:30.270 --> 00:54:30.280 align:start position:0%
you I looked at the testimony that the
 
00:54:35.309 --> 00:54:35.319 align:start position:0%
um police Chiefs Association sent us yes
 
00:54:35.319 --> 00:54:36.710 align:start position:0%
um police Chiefs Association sent us yes
and

00:54:36.710 --> 00:54:36.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:54:39.829 --> 00:54:39.839 align:start position:0%
I I thought most of that had to do with
 
00:54:44.910 --> 00:54:44.920 align:start position:0%
policy so since I presumably the police
 
00:54:46.430 --> 00:54:46.440 align:start position:0%
Chiefs know what they're doing and I
 
00:54:49.510 --> 00:54:49.520 align:start position:0%
don't know what I'm doing so maybe you
 
00:54:51.589 --> 00:54:51.599 align:start position:0%
could or have
 
00:54:54.069 --> 00:54:54.079 align:start position:0%
someone on the
 
00:54:56.789 --> 00:54:56.799 align:start position:0%
committee explain really what the
 
00:55:00.390 --> 00:55:00.400 align:start position:0%
difference is that is appropriate for us
 
00:55:03.510 --> 00:55:03.520 align:start position:0%
to be considering that's Revenue versus
 
00:55:07.470 --> 00:55:07.480 align:start position:0%
policy maybe my maybe my understanding
 
00:55:11.390 --> 00:55:11.400 align:start position:0%
isn't correct as to what policy is but
 
00:55:13.630 --> 00:55:13.640 align:start position:0%
did you look at the material that the
 
00:55:17.030 --> 00:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
police chief sent us I took took a look
 
00:55:19.710 --> 00:55:19.720 align:start position:0%
at what they Prov graphs and yeah I took
 
00:55:21.910 --> 00:55:21.920 align:start position:0%
a look at what they provided there is
 
00:55:26.470 --> 00:55:26.480 align:start position:0%
some uh in there relative to the revenue
 
00:55:28.829 --> 00:55:28.839 align:start position:0%
and that but but a lot of it was all
 
00:55:32.029 --> 00:55:32.039 align:start position:0%
that has all that that has to do with
 
00:55:34.549 --> 00:55:34.559 align:start position:0%
policy we're not considering good
 
00:55:36.109 --> 00:55:36.119 align:start position:0%
because it's already been passed and
 
00:55:38.670 --> 00:55:38.680 align:start position:0%
will you interrupt people who are
 
00:55:41.069 --> 00:55:41.079 align:start position:0%
testifying and say that
 
00:55:44.349 --> 00:55:44.359 align:start position:0%
because it is hard to remember that we
 
00:55:46.549 --> 00:55:46.559 align:start position:0%
just I will remember them thank
 
00:55:49.349 --> 00:55:49.359 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair I will let them
 
00:55:52.589 --> 00:55:52.599 align:start position:0%
know represent
 
00:55:55.549 --> 00:55:55.559 align:start position:0%
Aly thank you I think we all also should
 
00:55:59.230 --> 00:55:59.240 align:start position:0%
be looking at costs because the revenue
 
00:56:02.349 --> 00:56:02.359 align:start position:0%
has to be net from our
 
00:56:05.029 --> 00:56:05.039 align:start position:0%
perspective net of net of the costs of
 
00:56:07.990 --> 00:56:08.000 align:start position:0%
administration of this program that is
 
00:56:11.190 --> 00:56:11.200 align:start position:0%
correct that's why on what the police
 
00:56:14.190 --> 00:56:14.200 align:start position:0%
she sent to us has has an awful lot to
 
00:56:17.270 --> 00:56:17.280 align:start position:0%
do with with cost
 
00:56:20.069 --> 00:56:20.079 align:start position:0%
all I figur but anything that has to do
 
00:56:22.470 --> 00:56:22.480 align:start position:0%
with revenues and costs that's why we're
 
00:56:25.230 --> 00:56:25.240 align:start position:0%
having three people from the uh
 
00:56:27.950 --> 00:56:27.960 align:start position:0%
committee sit on this us
 
00:56:30.230 --> 00:56:30.240 align:start position:0%
Mr representative Lang over here
 
00:56:31.309 --> 00:56:31.319 align:start position:0%
representative Lang so I'm assuming
 
00:56:32.549 --> 00:56:32.559 align:start position:0%
we're going to be focusing around page
 
00:56:33.589 --> 00:56:33.599 align:start position:0%
eight when we're talking about the
 
00:56:36.270 --> 00:56:36.280 align:start position:0%
Cannabis control fund and all of the
 
00:56:38.150 --> 00:56:38.160 align:start position:0%

I always look at Ways and Means as the
 
00:56:42.150 --> 00:56:42.160 align:start position:0%
taxes fees and funds committee yes um

and so we'll be looking at that fund and
 
00:56:45.870 --> 00:56:45.880 align:start position:0%
and how that how that fun is be fund is
 
00:56:47.670 --> 00:56:47.680 align:start position:0%
being administered and how it's being
 
00:56:50.870 --> 00:56:50.880 align:start position:0%
controlled correct thank you anything to
 
00:56:53.870 --> 00:56:53.880 align:start position:0%
do with funds
 
00:56:57.510 --> 00:56:57.520 align:start position:0%
revenues we will look at the policies
 
00:57:01.029 --> 00:57:01.039 align:start position:0%
been set thank you Mr chair Mr chair

00:57:05.510 --> 00:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
jie does that include making money off
 
00:57:08.710 --> 00:57:08.720 align:start position:0%
of arresting people yes all right that
 
00:57:13.589 --> 00:57:13.599 align:start position:0%
was wise crack so Mr chair yes Brown I I

hallway yesterday when I was here and
 
00:57:20.390 --> 00:57:20.400 align:start position:0%
that they aware that they what their
 
00:57:23.510 --> 00:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
focus has to be I reminded them so they
 
00:57:25.630 --> 00:57:25.640 align:start position:0%
know uh
 
00:57:28.109 --> 00:57:28.119 align:start position:0%
and as far as I think I mentioned some
 
00:57:30.589 --> 00:57:30.599 align:start position:0%
of you earlier that I I I've been in
 
00:57:33.150 --> 00:57:33.160 align:start position:0%
communication with the Liquor Commission
 
00:57:34.630 --> 00:57:34.640 align:start position:0%
and I said you know we need to see the
 
00:57:36.589 --> 00:57:36.599 align:start position:0%
other half in the fiscal note we only
 
00:57:38.150 --> 00:57:38.160 align:start position:0%
have one half we have what their
 
00:57:39.589 --> 00:57:39.599 align:start position:0%
estimates of what it's going to cost to
 
00:57:42.230 --> 00:57:42.240 align:start position:0%
run the stores but I asked them well
 
00:57:43.549 --> 00:57:43.559 align:start position:0%
what's your estimates of how much
 
00:57:44.990 --> 00:57:45.000 align:start position:0%
revenue you're going to produce so that
 
00:57:46.349 --> 00:57:46.359 align:start position:0%
we can get the net because we're talking
 
00:57:48.549 --> 00:57:48.559 align:start position:0%
about the net here the Net's what what
 
00:57:50.990 --> 00:57:51.000 align:start position:0%
goes into the fund it's it's the it's
 
00:57:52.829 --> 00:57:52.839 align:start position:0%
just like the liquor model so they're
 
00:57:54.430 --> 00:57:54.440 align:start position:0%
going to come in today with uh with
 
00:57:55.430 --> 00:57:55.440 align:start position:0%
their best
 
00:57:58.430 --> 00:57:58.440 align:start position:0%
gu estimate of that so um they were
 
00:58:00.230 --> 00:58:00.240 align:start position:0%
going to try to do it ahead of time but
 
00:58:01.950 --> 00:58:01.960 align:start position:0%
they were still fine-tuning it so it'll
 
00:58:04.870 --> 00:58:04.880 align:start position:0%
be handed out when we're in the meeting
 
00:58:07.069 --> 00:58:07.079 align:start position:0%
methodology methodology yes we were
 
00:58:10.109 --> 00:58:10.119 align:start position:0%
hoping to have it by yesterday
 
00:58:23.710 --> 00:58:23.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:23.720 --> 00:58:27.510 align:start position:0%
 
yet

00:58:27.510 --> 00:58:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:28.950 --> 00:58:28.960 align:start position:0%
we still got three
 
00:58:51.789 --> 00:58:51.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:57.150 --> 00:58:57.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:57.160 --> 00:59:00.470 align:start position:0%
 
ask

00:59:00.470 --> 00:59:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:00.480 --> 00:59:23.630 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:59:23.630 --> 00:59:23.640 align:start position:0%

00:59:58.390 --> 00:59:58.400 align:start position:0%
yeah i' I'd just like to point out that
 
01:00:02.829 --> 01:00:02.839 align:start position:0%
this is within our fund
 
01:00:05.630 --> 01:00:05.640 align:start position:0%
mandate that we're just looking at it as
 
01:00:08.670 --> 01:00:08.680 align:start position:0%
a dedicated fund that I presume that's
 
01:00:11.789 --> 01:00:11.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:15.230 --> 01:00:15.240 align:start position:0%

Regal sewage treatment plant in Franklin
 
01:02:29.029 --> 01:02:29.039 align:start position:0%
the regional collection system and the
 
01:02:30.589 --> 01:02:30.599 align:start position:0%
treatment plant is operated by New

Improvement program review the contracts
 
01:02:39.910 --> 01:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
to plan design and construct Capital
 
01:02:41.910 --> 01:02:41.920 align:start position:0%

member communities pay all costs
 
01:02:50.269 --> 01:02:50.279 align:start position:0%
associated with the operations and
 
01:02:52.589 --> 01:02:52.599 align:start position:0%
maintenance of the system there have
 
01:02:55.309 --> 01:02:55.319 align:start position:0%
been no major changes to the uh excuse
 
01:02:57.109 --> 01:02:57.119 align:start position:0%
me the only state funds the program
 
01:02:59.069 --> 01:02:59.079 align:start position:0%
receives are from Grants and loans that
 
01:03:01.430 --> 01:03:01.440 align:start position:0%
the sewage treatment can receive such as
 
01:03:03.549 --> 01:03:03.559 align:start position:0%
any other sewage treatment plant there
 
01:03:04.950 --> 01:03:04.960 align:start position:0%
have been no major changes to the
 
01:03:07.430 --> 01:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
system's operations cost distribution
 
01:03:10.069 --> 01:03:10.079 align:start position:0%
plan since the 1980s when the system
 
01:03:12.910 --> 01:03:12.920 align:start position:0%
began operations the board its member
 
01:03:14.309 --> 01:03:14.319 align:start position:0%
communities and the program
 
01:03:16.069 --> 01:03:16.079 align:start position:0%
administrator have been working for
 
01:03:17.789 --> 01:03:17.799 align:start position:0%
several years on changes to the funding
 
01:03:20.549 --> 01:03:20.559 align:start position:0%
model so that more closely represents
 
01:03:22.589 --> 01:03:22.599 align:start position:0%
current usage of the system by the
 
01:03:25.549 --> 01:03:25.559 align:start position:0%
member communities and its organizations
 
01:03:27.029 --> 01:03:27.039 align:start position:0%
this is necessary as the actual
 
01:03:29.430 --> 01:03:29.440 align:start position:0%
Municipal growth do not align with the
 
01:03:32.390 --> 01:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
predictions that were made back in 1980s
 
01:03:34.510 --> 01:03:34.520 align:start position:0%
the water consumption changes due to the
 
01:03:36.710 --> 01:03:36.720 align:start position:0%
more efficient fixtures in buildings and
 
01:03:38.910 --> 01:03:38.920 align:start position:0%
maintenance of the municipality system
 
01:03:41.150 --> 01:03:41.160 align:start position:0%
itself the member communities are buil
 
01:03:44.510 --> 01:03:44.520 align:start position:0%
to support cost four excuse me four cost
 
01:03:46.829 --> 01:03:46.839 align:start position:0%
functions the methods for updating the
 
01:03:48.390 --> 01:03:48.400 align:start position:0%
distribution of costs for three of the
 
01:03:50.589 --> 01:03:50.599 align:start position:0%
four functions can be updated without
 
01:03:53.150 --> 01:03:53.160 align:start position:0%
any changes to existing laws the fourth
 
01:03:55.390 --> 01:03:55.400 align:start position:0%
the replacement fund can only be updated
 
01:03:58.069 --> 01:03:58.079 align:start position:0%
by the legislature the replacement fund
 
01:03:59.230 --> 01:03:59.240 align:start position:0%
is the account that department
 
01:04:01.190 --> 01:04:01.200 align:start position:0%
environmental services uses to fund the
 
01:04:03.430 --> 01:04:03.440 align:start position:0%
cost of repairs for unanticipated
 
01:04:05.789 --> 01:04:05.799 align:start position:0%
failures that cost more than can be
 
01:04:07.109 --> 01:04:07.119 align:start position:0%
funded from the operations and
 
01:04:09.230 --> 01:04:09.240 align:start position:0%
maintenance account but yet is not
 
01:04:12.710 --> 01:04:12.720 align:start position:0%
costly enough to bond to fund the
 
01:04:15.069 --> 01:04:15.079 align:start position:0%
repairs presently the cost of repairs
 
01:04:17.029 --> 01:04:17.039 align:start position:0%
funded through the replacement fund are
 
01:04:18.750 --> 01:04:18.760 align:start position:0%
distributed to member communities based
 
01:04:20.589 --> 01:04:20.599 align:start position:0%
on their use of the portion of the
 
01:04:23.069 --> 01:04:23.079 align:start position:0%
system that failed the impacted
 
01:04:24.990 --> 01:04:25.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities are required to pay back
 
01:04:27.269 --> 01:04:27.279 align:start position:0%
the fund for the cost of those repairs
 
01:04:29.910 --> 01:04:29.920 align:start position:0%
over 10 years the proposed change
 
01:04:31.950 --> 01:04:31.960 align:start position:0%
approved by the member communities will
 
01:04:34.309 --> 01:04:34.319 align:start position:0%
have the impacted communities paying 50%
 
01:04:36.829 --> 01:04:36.839 align:start position:0%
of the cost of the repairs and 50% of
 
01:04:38.349 --> 01:04:38.359 align:start position:0%
the cost of repairs will be distributed

committee representative brahney this is
 
01:05:39.750 --> 01:05:39.760 align:start position:0%
really a question but you said it and
 
01:05:41.829 --> 01:05:41.839 align:start position:0%
I'll make sure all 10 of these
 
01:05:44.829 --> 01:05:44.839 align:start position:0%
communities have agreed to this language
 
01:05:46.109 --> 01:05:46.119 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:05:49.190 --> 01:05:49.200 align:start position:0%
correct it's of the 10 member
 
01:05:51.470 --> 01:05:51.480 align:start position:0%
communities uh eight have agreed to the
 
01:05:55.029 --> 01:05:55.039 align:start position:0%
language two disagree uh but the
 
01:05:56.990 --> 01:05:57.000 align:start position:0%
basically the way The Advisory board set
 
01:05:58.950 --> 01:05:58.960 align:start position:0%
up it's a majority of the Quorum which
 
01:06:02.069 --> 01:06:02.079 align:start position:0%
is six and so we had eight that favored
 
01:06:03.910 --> 01:06:03.920 align:start position:0%
the vote so eight of the 10 do agree
 
01:06:06.710 --> 01:06:06.720 align:start position:0%
with this change uh can you can you
 
01:06:09.710 --> 01:06:09.720 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up can you explain why
 
01:06:12.870 --> 01:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
the two have exception to this
 
01:06:16.870 --> 01:06:16.880 align:start position:0%
change uh personal opinion in one case
 
01:06:19.150 --> 01:06:19.160 align:start position:0%
and I don't want to go from that
 
01:06:20.870 --> 01:06:20.880 align:start position:0%
standpoint the other is very close to
 
01:06:22.710 --> 01:06:22.720 align:start position:0%
the be where the plant comes into the
 
01:06:25.430 --> 01:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
system so it increase their costs a bit
 
01:06:28.549 --> 01:06:28.559 align:start position:0%
more okay the other one is is personal
 
01:06:31.710 --> 01:06:31.720 align:start position:0%
guess I'm not willing to all right but
 
01:06:33.670 --> 01:06:33.680 align:start position:0%
when but must follow but when they but
 
01:06:34.910 --> 01:06:34.920 align:start position:0%
but when they entered this agreement
 
01:06:36.430 --> 01:06:36.440 align:start position:0%
they understood that this was a majority
 
01:06:39.069 --> 01:06:39.079 align:start position:0%
roote changes correct okay thank
 
01:06:41.829 --> 01:06:41.839 align:start position:0%
you Mr
 
01:06:44.510 --> 01:06:44.520 align:start position:0%
chair thank you so my community samton
 
01:06:46.710 --> 01:06:46.720 align:start position:0%
is one of the towns that use your use
 
01:06:49.430 --> 01:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
this uh program and as I understand this
 
01:06:52.190 --> 01:06:52.200 align:start position:0%
bill what it's going to do is it looks
 
01:06:54.390 --> 01:06:54.400 align:start position:0%
like if you have a breakdown basically
 
01:06:56.510 --> 01:06:56.520 align:start position:0%
of the system and it affects one
 
01:06:58.950 --> 01:06:58.960 align:start position:0%
Community only or or a portion of you
 
01:07:00.430 --> 01:07:00.440 align:start position:0%
know only a segment of the pipeline so
 
01:07:03.630 --> 01:07:03.640 align:start position:0%
to speak um that that cost of repair
 
01:07:05.750 --> 01:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
will now be borne by anybody Downstream
 
01:07:10.470 --> 01:07:10.480 align:start position:0%
of that repair as well as um the other
 
01:07:12.910 --> 01:07:12.920 align:start position:0%
uh 50% is born by Downstream the other
 
01:07:15.190 --> 01:07:15.200 align:start position:0%
50% will be born by all 10 Towns as a
 
01:07:16.710 --> 01:07:16.720 align:start position:0%
maintenance of the system as a whole is
 
01:07:19.870 --> 01:07:19.880 align:start position:0%
that General concept conceptually you're
 
01:07:22.870 --> 01:07:22.880 align:start position:0%
close so for a repair on a certain
 
01:07:25.230 --> 01:07:25.240 align:start position:0%
portion of the line 50% of that cost
 
01:07:26.870 --> 01:07:26.880 align:start position:0%
will go to all the municipalities based
 
01:07:29.789 --> 01:07:29.799 align:start position:0%
off a respective distribution plan the
 
01:07:31.990 --> 01:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
other 50% of the cost goes to the
 
01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:33.269 align:start position:0%
other 50% of the cost goes to the
impacted

01:07:33.269 --> 01:07:33.279 align:start position:0%
impacted
 
01:07:35.510 --> 01:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
communities uh the best example I can
 
01:07:37.710 --> 01:07:37.720 align:start position:0%
give you was a recent one that happened
 
01:07:40.430 --> 01:07:40.440 align:start position:0%
in lonier and Guilford where a force
 
01:07:43.109 --> 01:07:43.119 align:start position:0%
main broke only two communities were
 
01:07:45.990 --> 01:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
impacted by it Guilford and lonia
 
01:07:48.670 --> 01:07:48.680 align:start position:0%
Guilford had 90% of the flow through it
 
01:07:52.190 --> 01:07:52.200 align:start position:0%
so they're paying 90% of the costs and
 
01:07:56.109 --> 01:07:56.119 align:start position:0%
lone had 10% so in that case 50% of it
 
01:07:59.470 --> 01:07:59.480 align:start position:0%
would be distributed 90% to Guilford 10%
 
01:08:01.470 --> 01:08:01.480 align:start position:0%
to lonia and the other 50% would be
 
01:08:03.510 --> 01:08:03.520 align:start position:0%
distributed among all the communities
 
01:08:06.190 --> 01:08:06.200 align:start position:0%
based off our respective formula thank
 
01:08:09.230 --> 01:08:09.240 align:start position:0%
you very much further
 
01:08:11.470 --> 01:08:11.480 align:start position:0%
questions represent BR so we're talking
 
01:08:15.950 --> 01:08:15.960 align:start position:0%
sewage here right right so so the do the
 
01:08:18.749 --> 01:08:18.759 align:start position:0%
communities pay or is it is it uh
 
01:08:21.229 --> 01:08:21.239 align:start position:0%
allocated through the sewer bills the
 
01:08:24.910 --> 01:08:24.920 align:start position:0%
bills who gets billed for this are
 
01:08:26.470 --> 01:08:26.480 align:start position:0%
I it really varies between the
 
01:08:28.789 --> 01:08:28.799 align:start position:0%
communities I can say the bill comes to
 
01:08:31.229 --> 01:08:31.239 align:start position:0%
the community or in one case it's a it's
 
01:08:34.229 --> 01:08:34.239 align:start position:0%
a sewer district and then that Community
 
01:08:36.229 --> 01:08:36.239 align:start position:0%
has the option of how they build it to
 
01:08:38.749 --> 01:08:38.759 align:start position:0%
their customers in the case of lonia
 
01:08:40.950 --> 01:08:40.960 align:start position:0%
which I'm most familiar with it's a it's
 
01:08:42.990 --> 01:08:43.000 align:start position:0%
basically a sewer charge based off water
 
01:08:46.430 --> 01:08:46.440 align:start position:0%
consumption okay all right thank
 
01:08:50.829 --> 01:08:50.839 align:start position:0%

co-sponsor uh I'm also the chair of the

environment and agriculture committee
 
01:32:55.550 --> 01:32:55.560 align:start position:0%
and we had this as a first bill and uh
 
01:32:57.390 --> 01:32:57.400 align:start position:0%
there since there's a money component it
 
01:32:59.350 --> 01:32:59.360 align:start position:0%
was sent two ways and means and you
 
01:33:01.510 --> 01:33:01.520 align:start position:0%
folks of the second committee on it but
 
01:33:03.709 --> 01:33:03.719 align:start position:0%
from a policy standpoint the members of
 
01:33:05.470 --> 01:33:05.480 align:start position:0%
the environment and a the majority of
 
01:33:06.629 --> 01:33:06.639 align:start position:0%
the members on environment and
 
01:33:08.950 --> 01:33:08.960 align:start position:0%
agricultural committee supported the
 
01:33:11.070 --> 01:33:11.080 align:start position:0%
passage of this bill just as a policy
 
01:33:13.189 --> 01:33:13.199 align:start position:0%
that it was a good idea for the State of
 
01:33:14.790 --> 01:33:14.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to support its
 
01:33:17.990 --> 01:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
agricultural Affairs for a a few reasons
 
01:33:20.590 --> 01:33:20.600 align:start position:0%
because there's a a strong educational
 
01:33:23.390 --> 01:33:23.400 align:start position:0%
and economic impact to that these 13
 
01:33:26.189 --> 01:33:26.199 align:start position:0%
fairs bring to the state of New
 
01:33:30.070 --> 01:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they uh they these fairs had
 
01:33:32.470 --> 01:33:32.480 align:start position:0%
passed uh support and they lost it in
 
01:33:34.709 --> 01:33:34.719 align:start position:0%
the late 70s and it was tied to the
 
01:33:37.070 --> 01:33:37.080 align:start position:0%
paramutual racing at the time that was
 
01:33:40.149 --> 01:33:40.159 align:start position:0%
occurring down in Salem and when that um
 
01:33:42.350 --> 01:33:42.360 align:start position:0%
industry kind of went by the wayside the
 
01:33:44.510 --> 01:33:44.520 align:start position:0%
funding mechanism for the support for
 
01:33:47.270 --> 01:33:47.280 align:start position:0%
these fairs did as well and they're
 
01:33:49.709 --> 01:33:49.719 align:start position:0%
they've U some of really suffered since
 
01:33:51.030 --> 01:33:51.040 align:start position:0%
then they they have a lot of
 
01:33:53.430 --> 01:33:53.440 align:start position:0%
infrastructure needs that they're trying
 
01:33:55.669 --> 01:33:55.679 align:start position:0%
to address and some of the fairs are
 
01:33:58.030 --> 01:33:58.040 align:start position:0%
doing well and some are not so the what
 
01:34:00.669 --> 01:34:00.679 align:start position:0%
was presented to us was a a grant
 
01:34:03.550 --> 01:34:03.560 align:start position:0%
process that they would put in place to
 
01:34:04.910 --> 01:34:04.920 align:start position:0%
that the commissioner would oversee
 
01:34:06.229 --> 01:34:06.239 align:start position:0%
Commissioner of Agriculture excuse me
 
01:34:09.390 --> 01:34:09.400 align:start position:0%
would oversee and they would uh figure
 
01:34:12.750 --> 01:34:12.760 align:start position:0%
out a way you know in rules to uh to put
 
01:34:14.790 --> 01:34:14.800 align:start position:0%
together a program that would be able to
 
01:34:17.790 --> 01:34:17.800 align:start position:0%
assist the uh the members of these these
 
01:34:19.270 --> 01:34:19.280 align:start position:0%
different Affairs that needed within
 
01:34:21.709 --> 01:34:21.719 align:start position:0%
their Community there's some specific on
 
01:34:24.070 --> 01:34:24.080 align:start position:0%
it uh it has to relate to infrastructure
 
01:34:26.310 --> 01:34:26.320 align:start position:0%
and I apologize I don't have the number
 
01:34:29.030 --> 01:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
right in front of me I believe it's a
 
01:34:30.910 --> 01:34:30.920 align:start position:0%
$250,000 amount that they were looking
 
01:34:32.950 --> 01:34:32.960 align:start position:0%
for so that's kind of what I wanted to
 
01:34:35.270 --> 01:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
come up cover was just come in and uh
 
01:34:37.189 --> 01:34:37.199 align:start position:0%
and support the bill from the uh
 
01:34:38.709 --> 01:34:38.719 align:start position:0%
majority position of the environment and
 
01:34:41.390 --> 01:34:41.400 align:start position:0%
agricultural committee and you'll um
 
01:34:42.750 --> 01:34:42.760 align:start position:0%
you'll get a lot more background
 
01:34:45.149 --> 01:34:45.159 align:start position:0%
information from uh representative lad
 
01:34:46.629 --> 01:34:46.639 align:start position:0%
and commissioner Jasper when they are
 
01:34:49.149 --> 01:34:49.159 align:start position:0%
able to address the committee on U many
 
01:34:50.629 --> 01:34:50.639 align:start position:0%
things they they're much more historians
 
01:34:53.189 --> 01:34:53.199 align:start position:0%
in this area than I
 
01:34:54.430 --> 01:34:54.440 align:start position:0%
that's all I'll have for you today and
 
01:34:56.709 --> 01:34:56.719 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to answer any
 
01:34:58.990 --> 01:34:59.000 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your testimony
 
01:35:01.550 --> 01:35:01.560 align:start position:0%
representative Pearl uh representative
 
01:35:04.430 --> 01:35:04.440 align:start position:0%
Bry so thank you Mr chair thank you uh
 
01:35:08.030 --> 01:35:08.040 align:start position:0%
representative Pearl so so just bill
 
01:35:10.590 --> 01:35:10.600 align:start position:0%
does two things it creates the fund
 
01:35:12.229 --> 01:35:12.239 align:start position:0%
which is really ways it means and then
 
01:35:14.709 --> 01:35:14.719 align:start position:0%
then it spends then it there's an Ask of
 
01:35:16.910 --> 01:35:16.920 align:start position:0%
250,000 a year it looks like from the
 
01:35:20.149 --> 01:35:20.159 align:start position:0%
general fund to be transferred into it
 
01:35:22.790 --> 01:35:22.800 align:start position:0%
uh but in addition to that is was it
 
01:35:25.990 --> 01:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
anticipated that other grants and other
 
01:35:28.910 --> 01:35:28.920 align:start position:0%
sources of revenue would also flow into
 
01:35:31.430 --> 01:35:31.440 align:start position:0%
this fund not that I'm aware of but I
 
01:35:32.669 --> 01:35:32.679 align:start position:0%
think honestly that'd be a better
 
01:35:35.470 --> 01:35:35.480 align:start position:0%
question for commissioner Jasper he's
 
01:35:37.950 --> 01:35:37.960 align:start position:0%
kind of this was more of his bill and
 
01:35:39.550 --> 01:35:39.560 align:start position:0%
and representative lad was working with
 
01:35:42.229 --> 01:35:42.239 align:start position:0%
him on it okay I don't recall that as in
 
01:35:43.790 --> 01:35:43.800 align:start position:0%
testimony in front of our committee but
 
01:35:46.270 --> 01:35:46.280 align:start position:0%
I ask you to put that question to okay
 
01:35:48.229 --> 01:35:48.239 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome thank you
 
01:35:48.239 --> 01:35:49.629 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome thank you
represent

01:35:49.629 --> 01:35:49.639 align:start position:0%
represent
 
01:35:52.990 --> 01:35:53.000 align:start position:0%
elme thank you Mr chair chairman on
 
01:35:57.310 --> 01:35:57.320 align:start position:0%
represent Pearl do uh do you have some
 
01:35:57.320 --> 01:35:58.390 align:start position:0%
represent Pearl do uh do you have some
thought

01:35:58.390 --> 01:35:58.400 align:start position:0%
thought
 
01:36:01.590 --> 01:36:01.600 align:start position:0%
on uh two questions that had come up in
 
01:36:04.990 --> 01:36:05.000 align:start position:0%
your committee I was subbing that day uh
 
01:36:08.430 --> 01:36:08.440 align:start position:0%
one of them was that oh This only
 
01:36:11.830 --> 01:36:11.840 align:start position:0%
affects the town that the fair is in and
 
01:36:14.790 --> 01:36:14.800 align:start position:0%
the town ought to be paying the cost of
 
01:36:18.590 --> 01:36:18.600 align:start position:0%
this uh and whether that would really be
 
01:36:20.870 --> 01:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
true in terms of the economic impact of
 
01:36:22.870 --> 01:36:22.880 align:start position:0%
the fair
 
01:36:26.990 --> 01:36:27.000 align:start position:0%
uh on New Hampshire and then I'd like to
 
01:36:28.550 --> 01:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
ask the second one
 
01:36:30.430 --> 01:36:30.440 align:start position:0%
separately okay I'll respond to the
 
01:36:32.669 --> 01:36:32.679 align:start position:0%
first one thank you for the question so
 
01:36:34.709 --> 01:36:34.719 align:start position:0%
my understanding from testimony received
 
01:36:36.629 --> 01:36:36.639 align:start position:0%
that these fairs really have a regional
 
01:36:39.350 --> 01:36:39.360 align:start position:0%
impact much greater than just the actual
 
01:36:40.990 --> 01:36:41.000 align:start position:0%
town that they reside in and they
 
01:36:43.830 --> 01:36:43.840 align:start position:0%
certainly do a lot in hosting um
 
01:36:46.709 --> 01:36:46.719 align:start position:0%
agricultur related um events outside of
 
01:36:50.870 --> 01:36:50.880 align:start position:0%
the actual Fair itself for uh 4 and um
 
01:36:52.910 --> 01:36:52.920 align:start position:0%
FF F but I believe it was mostly 4
 
01:36:54.750 --> 01:36:54.760 align:start position:0%
events that many of these
 
01:36:57.390 --> 01:36:57.400 align:start position:0%
Fairgrounds assist in hosting events and
 
01:36:59.149 --> 01:36:59.159 align:start position:0%
in several leine events I know like in
 
01:37:01.229 --> 01:37:01.239 align:start position:0%
the situation with Deerfield Fair they
 
01:37:03.070 --> 01:37:03.080 align:start position:0%
have regular ecoin events that occur
 
01:37:04.510 --> 01:37:04.520 align:start position:0%
there so they they serve a greater
 
01:37:05.910 --> 01:37:05.920 align:start position:0%
purpose within the agricultural
 
01:37:08.510 --> 01:37:08.520 align:start position:0%
Community certainly on a maybe not a
 
01:37:10.510 --> 01:37:10.520 align:start position:0%
year round basis but the the months that
 
01:37:13.590 --> 01:37:13.600 align:start position:0%
it's appropriate to be there on site
 
01:37:16.270 --> 01:37:16.280 align:start position:0%
does that answer your first part yes
 
01:37:21.990 --> 01:37:22.000 align:start position:0%
okay and the second one was about on the
 
01:37:24.870 --> 01:37:24.880 align:start position:0%
possibility of a revolving
 
01:37:27.830 --> 01:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
fund so that it could be onetime money
 
01:37:30.270 --> 01:37:30.280 align:start position:0%
and maybe come from
 
01:37:33.310 --> 01:37:33.320 align:start position:0%
ARA I I know we did have that discussion
 
01:37:35.870 --> 01:37:35.880 align:start position:0%
uh quite honestly I tried to keep our
 
01:37:37.470 --> 01:37:37.480 align:start position:0%
committee from staying out of the
 
01:37:39.470 --> 01:37:39.480 align:start position:0%
finance side of it as much as possible
 
01:37:41.669 --> 01:37:41.679 align:start position:0%
and stay more on the policy portion of
 
01:37:43.629 --> 01:37:43.639 align:start position:0%
it knowing that it was at the time it
 
01:37:45.310 --> 01:37:45.320 align:start position:0%
was going to either you or Finance I
 
01:37:46.830 --> 01:37:46.840 align:start position:0%
wasn't sure at the time and we had
 
01:37:48.990 --> 01:37:49.000 align:start position:0%
requested it come to Ways and Means and
 
01:37:50.589 --> 01:37:50.599 align:start position:0%
and the speaker was kind enough to Grant
 
01:37:52.669 --> 01:37:52.679 align:start position:0%
it so I guess you've you've got this
 
01:37:55.149 --> 01:37:55.159 align:start position:0%
bill upon my request and and uh I hope
 
01:37:57.750 --> 01:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
you'll do good things with
 
01:38:01.629 --> 01:38:01.639 align:start position:0%
it thank you further questions of
 
01:38:05.430 --> 01:38:05.440 align:start position:0%
Representative Pearl represent J thank
 
01:38:07.229 --> 01:38:07.239 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you representative
 
01:38:09.790 --> 01:38:09.800 align:start position:0%
Pearl for taking my question um you
 
01:38:13.109 --> 01:38:13.119 align:start position:0%
mentioned that um some of the fair
 
01:38:15.149 --> 01:38:15.159 align:start position:0%
grounds or fairs are doing fine but
 
01:38:18.390 --> 01:38:18.400 align:start position:0%
others may need help um why why is it
 
01:38:19.790 --> 01:38:19.800 align:start position:0%
that some need help what are the ones
 
01:38:21.510 --> 01:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
that don't need help doing what is the
 
01:38:24.149 --> 01:38:24.159 align:start position:0%
difference between the two sure that's a
 
01:38:26.109 --> 01:38:26.119 align:start position:0%
great question I don't know that I can
 
01:38:29.270 --> 01:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
answer that with any specificity only
 
01:38:31.189 --> 01:38:31.199 align:start position:0%
basically my observations from attending
 
01:38:34.830 --> 01:38:34.840 align:start position:0%
these fairs uh certainly location is is
 
01:38:36.629 --> 01:38:36.639 align:start position:0%
one part of it the the the further south
 
01:38:38.510 --> 01:38:38.520 align:start position:0%
that the fair is the the more access it
 
01:38:41.950 --> 01:38:41.960 align:start position:0%
has to the markets of people you know U
 
01:38:43.310 --> 01:38:43.320 align:start position:0%
folks will come across from Boston
 
01:38:45.070 --> 01:38:45.080 align:start position:0%
perhaps and go to Deerfield or or
 
01:38:46.149 --> 01:38:46.159 align:start position:0%
Southern New Hampshire more than they
 
01:38:48.310 --> 01:38:48.320 align:start position:0%
would drive to Lancaster or or Cornish
 
01:38:50.070 --> 01:38:50.080 align:start position:0%
and and the size of the fair as well
 
01:38:52.070 --> 01:38:52.080 align:start position:0%
some of these fairs are much larger than
 
01:38:54.550 --> 01:38:54.560 align:start position:0%
than others and are able to you know
 
01:38:57.229 --> 01:38:57.239 align:start position:0%
offer more in the Midway and and things
 
01:38:58.510 --> 01:38:58.520 align:start position:0%
like that different attractions that
 
01:39:00.229 --> 01:39:00.239 align:start position:0%
would bring people in so ticket sales
 
01:39:04.070 --> 01:39:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:08.149 --> 01:39:08.159 align:start position:0%
it representative Bry just thinking here
 
01:39:11.189 --> 01:39:11.199 align:start position:0%
so is is the purpose of the fund to help
 
01:39:13.070 --> 01:39:13.080 align:start position:0%
it's Capital Improvement projects is
 
01:39:14.950 --> 01:39:14.960 align:start position:0%
that pretty much where it's not supposed
 
01:39:17.390 --> 01:39:17.400 align:start position:0%
to offset operating losses but to help
 
01:39:19.950 --> 01:39:19.960 align:start position:0%
them keep the barns up or whatever else
 
01:39:21.990 --> 01:39:22.000 align:start position:0%
that's correct that my
 
01:39:24.709 --> 01:39:24.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:27.669 --> 01:39:27.679 align:start position:0%
you further
 
01:39:29.910 --> 01:39:29.920 align:start position:0%
questions represent
 
01:39:33.310 --> 01:39:33.320 align:start position:0%
gal does this include county fairs I'm
 
01:39:36.390 --> 01:39:36.400 align:start position:0%
assuming it does but don't want to so
 
01:39:38.910 --> 01:39:38.920 align:start position:0%
this was targeted to the 13 fairs that
 
01:39:41.229 --> 01:39:41.239 align:start position:0%
were specifically part of I apologize I
 
01:39:42.430 --> 01:39:42.440 align:start position:0%
don't have the language right in front
 
01:39:43.589 --> 01:39:43.599 align:start position:0%
of me that were part of the New
 
01:39:45.229 --> 01:39:45.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire fairs Association if I
 
01:39:48.310 --> 01:39:48.320 align:start position:0%
remember correctly and um they are
 
01:39:50.149 --> 01:39:50.159 align:start position:0%
there's there are 13 that were
 
01:39:51.750 --> 01:39:51.760 align:start position:0%
registered with them I guess I don't
 
01:39:53.750 --> 01:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
know if you'd call them a county fair or
 
01:39:55.750 --> 01:39:55.760 align:start position:0%
a state fair and we we into the little
 
01:39:58.109 --> 01:39:58.119 align:start position:0%
bit of that terminology ourself but it's
 
01:39:59.669 --> 01:39:59.679 align:start position:0%
specifically for those fairs that are
 
01:40:02.030 --> 01:40:02.040 align:start position:0%
registered with the state fairs
 
01:40:05.430 --> 01:40:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:08.589 --> 01:40:08.599 align:start position:0%
welcome representative alme that gives
 
01:40:10.629 --> 01:40:10.639 align:start position:0%
me another question how do we find the
 
01:40:14.030 --> 01:40:14.040 align:start position:0%
county fairs Association I the the sorry
 
01:40:16.550 --> 01:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
the the New Hampshire fairs
 
01:40:18.390 --> 01:40:18.400 align:start position:0%
Association that would be a great
 
01:40:20.109 --> 01:40:20.119 align:start position:0%
question for commissioner Jasper and I'm
 
01:40:21.629 --> 01:40:21.639 align:start position:0%
certain he'd be able to to provide that
 
01:40:25.189 --> 01:40:25.199 align:start position:0%
for you I I believe that I I believe
 
01:40:26.750 --> 01:40:26.760 align:start position:0%
that falls under his purview under the
 
01:40:28.149 --> 01:40:28.159 align:start position:0%
Department of Agriculture but he could
 
01:40:30.229 --> 01:40:30.239 align:start position:0%
certainly provide that for
 
01:40:34.149 --> 01:40:34.159 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chair I'd like to
 
01:40:36.950 --> 01:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
suggest that well maybe I should do it
 
01:40:39.910 --> 01:40:39.920 align:start position:0%
uh try to call him up and get him to get
 
01:40:43.550 --> 01:40:43.560 align:start position:0%
someone to come to talk about it because
 
01:40:45.870 --> 01:40:45.880 align:start position:0%
the commissioner didn't seem to know
 
01:40:48.070 --> 01:40:48.080 align:start position:0%
much about some of not quite a few of
 
01:40:48.080 --> 01:40:48.910 align:start position:0%
much about some of not quite a few of
the

01:40:48.910 --> 01:40:48.920 align:start position:0%

or hi I'll introduce myself my name is
 
01:42:04.750 --> 01:42:04.760 align:start position:0%
Sher Duty I'm a state representative
 
01:42:08.750 --> 01:42:08.760 align:start position:0%
from Nashville ward 3 Hillsboro 30 and
 
01:42:11.910 --> 01:42:11.920 align:start position:0%
you're testifying in opposition and I am
 
01:42:15.950 --> 01:42:15.960 align:start position:0%
right okay and I will hold this up
 
01:42:18.750 --> 01:42:18.760 align:start position:0%
because if I put on my reading glasses
 
01:42:21.390 --> 01:42:21.400 align:start position:0%
they'll kind of fog up so
 
01:42:24.070 --> 01:42:24.080 align:start position:0%
uh I am here today to speak against HB
 
01:42:24.080 --> 01:42:25.709 align:start position:0%
uh I am here today to speak against HB
1584

01:42:25.709 --> 01:42:25.719 align:start position:0%
1584
 
01:42:28.550 --> 01:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
FN although I support the intent of this
 
01:42:30.870 --> 01:42:30.880 align:start position:0%
bill which is to modernize and improve
 
01:42:33.149 --> 01:42:33.159 align:start position:0%
the infrastructure of regional
 
01:42:35.950 --> 01:42:35.960 align:start position:0%
agricultural Fairgrounds I disagree with
 
01:42:38.350 --> 01:42:38.360 align:start position:0%
the idea that taxpayer dollars should be
 
01:42:40.950 --> 01:42:40.960 align:start position:0%
taken from the general fund to support
 
01:42:43.750 --> 01:42:43.760 align:start position:0%
the private nonprofit organizations that
 
01:42:47.470 --> 01:42:47.480 align:start position:0%
run them as a member of the environment
 
01:42:51.189 --> 01:42:51.199 align:start position:0%
and agricultural committee since 2019 I
 
01:42:54.109 --> 01:42:54.119 align:start position:0%
have witnessed many good programs die
 
01:42:57.470 --> 01:42:57.480 align:start position:0%
due to lack of funding a bill to support
 
01:43:00.270 --> 01:43:00.280 align:start position:0%
an animal abuse fund was voted down
 
01:43:01.870 --> 01:43:01.880 align:start position:0%
because it would have increased dog
 
01:43:06.390 --> 01:43:06.400 align:start position:0%
licensing fees by 50 Cents a year it was
 
01:43:09.709 --> 01:43:09.719 align:start position:0%
deemed a tax by my colleagues across the
 
01:43:12.709 --> 01:43:12.719 align:start position:0%
aisle in New Hampshire right now we have
 
01:43:16.669 --> 01:43:16.679 align:start position:0%
a recycling municipal waste crisis after
 
01:43:19.910 --> 01:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
Decades of defunding New Hampshire Dees
 
01:43:21.950 --> 01:43:21.960 align:start position:0%
we have a waste management plan that
 
01:43:24.430 --> 01:43:24.440 align:start position:0%
hasn't been updated since
 
01:43:27.350 --> 01:43:27.360 align:start position:0%
2003 we have not met recycling goals
 
01:43:29.310 --> 01:43:29.320 align:start position:0%
that were set for
 
01:43:32.390 --> 01:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
1995 we lag all the other New England
 
01:43:36.070 --> 01:43:36.080 align:start position:0%
states in this area New Hampshire Dees
 
01:43:38.589 --> 01:43:38.599 align:start position:0%
is funded through the same Source the
 
01:43:43.470 --> 01:43:43.480 align:start position:0%
general fund as the request for hb1 1584
 
01:43:46.750 --> 01:43:46.760 align:start position:0%
FN without the necessary funds to create
 
01:43:49.750 --> 01:43:49.760 align:start position:0%
plans and staff for implementation and
 
01:43:52.790 --> 01:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
oversight in a vital area like Solid
 
01:43:54.510 --> 01:43:54.520 align:start position:0%
Waste Management and
 
01:43:58.149 --> 01:43:58.159 align:start position:0%
recycling how can we justify taking
 
01:44:01.669 --> 01:44:01.679 align:start position:0%
$250,000 a year for Capital Improvements
 
01:44:04.550 --> 01:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
to Regional fairs that attract only a
 
01:44:06.669 --> 01:44:06.679 align:start position:0%
small portion of the
 
01:44:10.990 --> 01:44:11.000 align:start position:0%
population right now I am trying to find
 
01:44:14.669 --> 01:44:14.679 align:start position:0%
$380,000 to fund a one-time setup of a
 
01:44:17.790 --> 01:44:17.800 align:start position:0%
testing program for CBD
 
01:44:20.270 --> 01:44:20.280 align:start position:0%
labeling this bill has passed both the
 
01:44:22.870 --> 01:44:22.880 align:start position:0%
house and Senate but without funding it
 
01:44:26.870 --> 01:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
will go nowhere improper CBD labeling
 
01:44:29.669 --> 01:44:29.679 align:start position:0%
due to no oversight or testing in New
 
01:44:33.990 --> 01:44:34.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire cost consumers thousands of
 
01:44:36.270 --> 01:44:36.280 align:start position:0%
dollars uh yes what is your point of
 
01:44:38.229 --> 01:44:38.239 align:start position:0%
order have we gotten off of this bill
 
01:44:41.310 --> 01:44:41.320 align:start position:0%
onto another bill Mr chairman I've been
 
01:44:41.320 --> 01:44:43.990 align:start position:0%
onto another bill Mr chairman I've been
wondering

01:44:43.990 --> 01:44:44.000 align:start position:0%
wondering
 
01:44:47.390 --> 01:44:47.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:50.149 --> 01:44:50.159 align:start position:0%
sorry his question have we gotten off
 
01:44:53.990 --> 01:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
from this Bill H House Bill
 
01:44:57.390 --> 01:44:57.400 align:start position:0%
1584 one of the things is that the
 
01:44:59.750 --> 01:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
policy has been decided by the
 
01:45:02.550 --> 01:45:02.560 align:start position:0%
environment and agricultureal committee
 
01:45:05.750 --> 01:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
and we're dealing with the revenue
 
01:45:07.070 --> 01:45:07.080 align:start position:0%
aspect of
 
01:45:11.669 --> 01:45:11.679 align:start position:0%
it so correct if you uh and and my and
 
01:45:15.310 --> 01:45:15.320 align:start position:0%
keep your testimony okay and my point
 
01:45:19.709 --> 01:45:19.719 align:start position:0%
being is that in the past funding has
 
01:45:21.750 --> 01:45:21.760 align:start position:0%
not been
 
01:45:25.109 --> 01:45:25.119 align:start position:0%
appropriated for bills that have been
 
01:45:29.109 --> 01:45:29.119 align:start position:0%
passed um that uh are
 
01:45:33.350 --> 01:45:33.360 align:start position:0%
effective e effective for a vast
 
01:45:36.310 --> 01:45:36.320 align:start position:0%
majority of the people I'll conclude
 
01:45:40.070 --> 01:45:40.080 align:start position:0%
with 13 Regional fairs and a
 
01:45:43.950 --> 01:45:43.960 align:start position:0%
$250,000 annual request this amounts to
 
01:45:46.430 --> 01:45:46.440 align:start position:0%
less than $220,000 in Capital
 
01:45:50.030 --> 01:45:50.040 align:start position:0%
Improvements per Fair per year if the
 
01:45:52.990 --> 01:45:53.000 align:start position:0%
economic IC benefit to a region hosting
 
01:45:56.430 --> 01:45:56.440 align:start position:0%
the fair is so great as the sponsor has
 
01:45:59.109 --> 01:45:59.119 align:start position:0%
indicated then businesses in the area
 
01:46:00.950 --> 01:46:00.960 align:start position:0%
should be able to raise that amount of
 
01:46:04.390 --> 01:46:04.400 align:start position:0%
money for their own benefit thank
 
01:46:07.149 --> 01:46:07.159 align:start position:0%
you thank you for your testimony
 
01:46:10.550 --> 01:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
representative um would you have a copy
 
01:46:13.390 --> 01:46:13.400 align:start position:0%
of that you leave with the committee and
 
01:46:16.350 --> 01:46:16.360 align:start position:0%
I can uh the clerk sure I'll I'll hand
 
01:46:18.830 --> 01:46:18.840 align:start position:0%
it to you thank you uh question
 
01:46:21.510 --> 01:46:21.520 align:start position:0%
representative Abney
 
01:46:23.310 --> 01:46:23.320 align:start position:0%
so thank you for your testimony so my
 
01:46:24.990 --> 01:46:25.000 align:start position:0%
sense is that you're not necessarily
 
01:46:26.910 --> 01:46:26.920 align:start position:0%
against the 250 but it wouldn't be your
 
01:46:29.990 --> 01:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
top priority in terms of other
 
01:46:32.870 --> 01:46:32.880 align:start position:0%
expenditures that you feel are more uh
 
01:46:35.870 --> 01:46:35.880 align:start position:0%
important than this is that did I say
 
01:46:38.430 --> 01:46:38.440 align:start position:0%
that right yeah I think that's fair to
 
01:46:42.270 --> 01:46:42.280 align:start position:0%
say I mean if we're if if there are
 
01:46:47.109 --> 01:46:47.119 align:start position:0%
other needs greater needs that uh Solid
 
01:46:47.119 --> 01:46:48.109 align:start position:0%
other needs greater needs that uh Solid
Waste

01:46:48.109 --> 01:46:48.119 align:start position:0%
Waste
 
01:46:51.350 --> 01:46:51.360 align:start position:0%
Management um you know consumer
 
01:46:54.510 --> 01:46:54.520 align:start position:0%
protection and those are not priorities
 
01:46:56.189 --> 01:46:56.199 align:start position:0%
why should we make this
 
01:46:58.750 --> 01:46:58.760 align:start position:0%
$250,000 which is an annual
 
01:47:02.390 --> 01:47:02.400 align:start position:0%
request okay um you know I've been
 
01:47:04.750 --> 01:47:04.760 align:start position:0%
looking for money for a one-time request
 
01:47:07.430 --> 01:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
and we can't find it um so I would say
 
01:47:08.870 --> 01:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
why would we want to make this a
 
01:47:12.070 --> 01:47:12.080 align:start position:0%
priority now I you know I I
 
01:47:14.189 --> 01:47:14.199 align:start position:0%
recognize you know I recognize that
 
01:47:16.430 --> 01:47:16.440 align:start position:0%
there's always trade-offs and we have to
 
01:47:18.350 --> 01:47:18.360 align:start position:0%
you know there there there's pros and
 
01:47:21.350 --> 01:47:21.360 align:start position:0%
cons um
 
01:47:23.390 --> 01:47:23.400 align:start position:0%
but I think you know we we need to look
 
01:47:26.870 --> 01:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
at this in total uh you have 13
 
01:47:30.229 --> 01:47:30.239 align:start position:0%
fairs uh we were the testimony that came
 
01:47:33.149 --> 01:47:33.159 align:start position:0%
before our committee was strongly
 
01:47:37.030 --> 01:47:37.040 align:start position:0%
slanted towards the economic Boon that
 
01:47:41.030 --> 01:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
that these um fairs are to the region
 
01:47:43.189 --> 01:47:43.199 align:start position:0%
and I guess you know as a for former
 
01:47:46.270 --> 01:47:46.280 align:start position:0%
businesswoman I would say uh if it's
 
01:47:49.830 --> 01:47:49.840 align:start position:0%
such an economic boom then why wouldn't
 
01:47:52.550 --> 01:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
the business businesses in the area uh
 
01:47:55.589 --> 01:47:55.599 align:start position:0%
want to uh contribute and I mean really
 
01:47:57.790 --> 01:47:57.800 align:start position:0%
when you think about it $20,000 less
 
01:48:02.149 --> 01:48:02.159 align:start position:0%
than $2,000 a year uh to support a fair
 
01:48:05.109 --> 01:48:05.119 align:start position:0%
that is an economic boom to your area it
 
01:48:07.669 --> 01:48:07.679 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to me that that's that
 
01:48:10.750 --> 01:48:10.760 align:start position:0%
unreasonable to a ask for business from
 
01:48:15.870 --> 01:48:15.880 align:start position:0%
businesses and B to look for Grants um
 
01:48:18.270 --> 01:48:18.280 align:start position:0%
as a chair of the Nashville Conservation
 
01:48:19.709 --> 01:48:19.719 align:start position:0%
Commission I've been doing a lot of
 
01:48:19.719 --> 01:48:20.990 align:start position:0%
Commission I've been doing a lot of
exploration

01:48:20.990 --> 01:48:21.000 align:start position:0%
exploration
 
01:48:23.790 --> 01:48:23.800 align:start position:0%
lately on what Grant programs are out
 
01:48:28.470 --> 01:48:28.480 align:start position:0%
there um you know to help our um city
 
01:48:30.270 --> 01:48:30.280 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot of them out there but
 
01:48:33.510 --> 01:48:33.520 align:start position:0%
it's a lot of work you know you um
 
01:48:35.310 --> 01:48:35.320 align:start position:0%
there's there's no one place you can go
 
01:48:38.390 --> 01:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
to and say oh here's all the money you
 
01:48:40.790 --> 01:48:40.800 align:start position:0%
know that you want you have to find the
 
01:48:43.510 --> 01:48:43.520 align:start position:0%
grants you have to uh recognize what
 
01:48:45.910 --> 01:48:45.920 align:start position:0%
their qualifications are you have to you
 
01:48:48.390 --> 01:48:48.400 align:start position:0%
know match that up with what what you
 
01:48:51.310 --> 01:48:51.320 align:start position:0%
want it is a lot of work but the money
 
01:48:53.910 --> 01:48:53.920 align:start position:0%
you know is out there and I question
 
01:48:56.629 --> 01:48:56.639 align:start position:0%
whether or not these associate you maybe
 
01:48:59.149 --> 01:48:59.159 align:start position:0%
what the association should do is in
 
01:49:02.270 --> 01:49:02.280 align:start position:0%
terms of instead of operating as 13
 
01:49:04.229 --> 01:49:04.239 align:start position:0%
individual maybe they should come
 
01:49:07.189 --> 01:49:07.199 align:start position:0%
together look at Grants um that they
 
01:49:09.830 --> 01:49:09.840 align:start position:0%
might be able to apply for so they don't
 
01:49:13.030 --> 01:49:13.040 align:start position:0%
have to come um and and request money
 
01:49:14.990 --> 01:49:15.000 align:start position:0%
for the general
 
01:49:17.229 --> 01:49:17.239 align:start position:0%
fund further
 
01:49:20.310 --> 01:49:20.320 align:start position:0%
questions represent lion thank you Mr
 
01:49:21.270 --> 01:49:21.280 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
01:49:23.470 --> 01:49:23.480 align:start position:0%
question I I guess my question stems
 
01:49:25.189 --> 01:49:25.199 align:start position:0%
around the finance side of this
 
01:49:26.750 --> 01:49:26.760 align:start position:0%
conversation when I talk about Finance I
 
01:49:28.669 --> 01:49:28.679 align:start position:0%
don't mean the 250,000 I talk about the
 
01:49:30.189 --> 01:49:30.199 align:start position:0%
overall impact to the state of New
 
01:49:32.430 --> 01:49:32.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire just in my quick calculations
 
01:49:34.270 --> 01:49:34.280 align:start position:0%
while while you were talking I was
 
01:49:36.629 --> 01:49:36.639 align:start position:0%
looking about attendance it looks like
 
01:49:38.350 --> 01:49:38.360 align:start position:0%
between these 12 fairs we have over a
 
01:49:40.189 --> 01:49:40.199 align:start position:0%
half a million people have attended
 
01:49:42.109 --> 01:49:42.119 align:start position:0%
these fairs and do you think that does
 
01:49:43.790 --> 01:49:43.800 align:start position:0%
that that doesn't have an impact in the
 
01:49:45.470 --> 01:49:45.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as a whole through either our
 
01:49:48.270 --> 01:49:48.280 align:start position:0%
tax revenues through bringing tourism um
 
01:49:50.550 --> 01:49:50.560 align:start position:0%
and and and helping our state you know
 
01:49:53.790 --> 01:49:53.800 align:start position:0%
as a as a destination right to go let's
 
01:49:55.270 --> 01:49:55.280 align:start position:0%
go and hang out the Hopkin Fair let's go
 
01:49:56.870 --> 01:49:56.880 align:start position:0%
hang out the Deerfield Fair the the
 
01:49:58.709 --> 01:49:58.719 align:start position:0%
North havil Fair it's funny I was
 
01:50:01.510 --> 01:50:01.520 align:start position:0%
reading about 1983 report for the uh
 
01:50:03.589 --> 01:50:03.599 align:start position:0%
Sandwich Fair and it says 3,000 people
 
01:50:04.709 --> 01:50:04.719 align:start position:0%
attended there was very little
 
01:50:07.589 --> 01:50:07.599 align:start position:0%
drunkenness in uh that happened so I
 
01:50:09.990 --> 01:50:10.000 align:start position:0%
guess it goes all the way back to 198
 
01:50:12.629 --> 01:50:12.639 align:start position:0%
1893 and and we have a a long history in
 
01:50:14.270 --> 01:50:14.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire of supporting these fairs
 
01:50:16.149 --> 01:50:16.159 align:start position:0%
and and and and encouraging these fairs
 
01:50:17.990 --> 01:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
and I guess my question goes around is
 
01:50:19.629 --> 01:50:19.639 align:start position:0%
as we look at this as a big picture for
 
01:50:19.639 --> 01:50:20.629 align:start position:0%
as we look at this as a big picture for
namp

01:50:20.629 --> 01:50:20.639 align:start position:0%
namp
 
01:50:22.510 --> 01:50:22.520 align:start position:0%
right do you not think that these that
 
01:50:24.030 --> 01:50:24.040 align:start position:0%
that supporting these kind of programs
 
01:50:26.709 --> 01:50:26.719 align:start position:0%
that bring tourism and bring you know
 
01:50:28.910 --> 01:50:28.920 align:start position:0%
increased revenues to to the spending
 
01:50:30.589 --> 01:50:30.599 align:start position:0%
you know consumer spending is isn't that
 
01:50:32.390 --> 01:50:32.400 align:start position:0%
important for us to
 
01:50:34.870 --> 01:50:34.880 align:start position:0%
consider uh representative Lang I think
 
01:50:38.030 --> 01:50:38.040 align:start position:0%
you've underscored my point and that is
 
01:50:40.830 --> 01:50:40.840 align:start position:0%
is if it brings such an economic Boon to
 
01:50:43.589 --> 01:50:43.599 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire then maybe
 
01:50:46.629 --> 01:50:46.639 align:start position:0%
then then the businesses that profit
 
01:50:49.350 --> 01:50:49.360 align:start position:0%
from that economic boom should be
 
01:50:52.310 --> 01:50:52.320 align:start position:0%
putting some skin in the game also I
 
01:50:53.950 --> 01:50:53.960 align:start position:0%
mean you know aren't there isn't there
 
01:50:56.189 --> 01:50:56.199 align:start position:0%
money that comes from the tourism are
 
01:50:58.229 --> 01:50:58.239 align:start position:0%
there grants available through the
 
01:50:59.830 --> 01:50:59.840 align:start position:0%
Department of Tourism that we already
 
01:51:02.350 --> 01:51:02.360 align:start position:0%
fund that might be available for this
 
01:51:04.910 --> 01:51:04.920 align:start position:0%
all I'm saying is is this really
 
01:51:07.990 --> 01:51:08.000 align:start position:0%
something that the general fund a fund
 
01:51:10.830 --> 01:51:10.840 align:start position:0%
that over the decades has defunded New
 
01:51:14.709 --> 01:51:14.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Dees that affects everybody in
 
01:51:18.189 --> 01:51:18.199 align:start position:0%
this state okay uh is this something
 
01:51:20.390 --> 01:51:20.400 align:start position:0%
that the general that we should be
 
01:51:22.189 --> 01:51:22.199 align:start position:0%
funding through the general
 
01:51:24.149 --> 01:51:24.159 align:start position:0%
fund and I think you know that's
 
01:51:26.510 --> 01:51:26.520 align:start position:0%
something I can't I can't make that
 
01:51:29.310 --> 01:51:29.320 align:start position:0%
decision that's I believe Ways and Means
 
01:51:31.310 --> 01:51:31.320 align:start position:0%
from what I
 
01:51:34.830 --> 01:51:34.840 align:start position:0%
understand further questions represent
 
01:51:38.470 --> 01:51:38.480 align:start position:0%
elmy thank you uh I think I agree with
 
01:51:40.390 --> 01:51:40.400 align:start position:0%
you with the general fund that doesn't
 
01:51:43.790 --> 01:51:43.800 align:start position:0%
mean that the state having a lot of
 
01:51:46.669 --> 01:51:46.679 align:start position:0%
extra cash at the moment couldn't help
 
01:51:50.750 --> 01:51:50.760 align:start position:0%
on this on one time on
 
01:51:50.760 --> 01:51:52.870 align:start position:0%
on this on one time on
would

01:51:52.870 --> 01:51:52.880 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:51:56.109 --> 01:51:56.119 align:start position:0%
you agree that
 
01:52:01.510 --> 01:52:01.520 align:start position:0%
Nashua and on other fairs that are close
 
01:52:03.310 --> 01:52:03.320 align:start position:0%
to the Massachusetts
 
01:52:07.109 --> 01:52:07.119 align:start position:0%
border uh and very large in size
 
01:52:10.830 --> 01:52:10.840 align:start position:0%
themselves would have an easier time of
 
01:52:13.310 --> 01:52:13.320 align:start position:0%
financing their Fair including their
 
01:52:15.430 --> 01:52:15.440 align:start position:0%
businesses would have a very much easier
 
01:52:18.950 --> 01:52:18.960 align:start position:0%
time financing their Affair than um
 
01:52:23.950 --> 01:52:23.960 align:start position:0%
North haal or or even Laconia which is a
 
01:52:28.229 --> 01:52:28.239 align:start position:0%
tourist Mecca I think for longer periods
 
01:52:31.910 --> 01:52:31.920 align:start position:0%
than North hav all
 
01:52:34.830 --> 01:52:34.840 align:start position:0%
is well nsha doesn't have a fair and we
 
01:52:36.950 --> 01:52:36.960 align:start position:0%
I mean we don't have a regional fair I
 
01:52:39.669 --> 01:52:39.679 align:start position:0%
think the closest one may be Deerfield
 
01:52:42.030 --> 01:52:42.040 align:start position:0%
but yes representative all we I I mean I
 
01:52:44.270 --> 01:52:44.280 align:start position:0%
agree with you and you know and and to
 
01:52:46.669 --> 01:52:46.679 align:start position:0%
be fair I don't
 
01:52:49.510 --> 01:52:49.520 align:start position:0%
have you know I live in Nashua so I
 
01:52:51.990 --> 01:52:52.000 align:start position:0%
don't have a
 
01:52:57.830 --> 01:52:57.840 align:start position:0%
good um a a lot of experience with the
 
01:52:59.030 --> 01:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
difficulty in
 
01:53:02.550 --> 01:53:02.560 align:start position:0%
funding um things you know in the rural
 
01:53:05.990 --> 01:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
areas and and I would certainly you know
 
01:53:08.790 --> 01:53:08.800 align:start position:0%
look to my fellow representatives to
 
01:53:11.350 --> 01:53:11.360 align:start position:0%
provide me with that that understanding
 
01:53:14.069 --> 01:53:14.079 align:start position:0%
I mean that that's clear and you know if
 
01:53:17.870 --> 01:53:17.880 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of money at this point in
 
01:53:21.830 --> 01:53:21.840 align:start position:0%
time and we can ask allocate that to
 
01:53:24.069 --> 01:53:24.079 align:start position:0%
Capital Improvements so that it's a
 
01:53:26.589 --> 01:53:26.599 align:start position:0%
better experience for people in New
 
01:53:28.830 --> 01:53:28.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you know I don't think that's
 
01:53:31.030 --> 01:53:31.040 align:start position:0%
an issue I guess the issue that I have
 
01:53:34.790 --> 01:53:34.800 align:start position:0%
is that making this an annual a um an
 
01:53:37.430 --> 01:53:37.440 align:start position:0%
annual grant that comes from the the
 
01:53:37.440 --> 01:53:40.149 align:start position:0%
annual grant that comes from the the
general

01:53:40.149 --> 01:53:40.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:42.550 --> 01:53:42.560 align:start position:0%
fund you know I I guess maybe we can
 
01:53:44.510 --> 01:53:44.520 align:start position:0%
rethink you know maybe this is a time to
 
01:53:48.750 --> 01:53:48.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:48.760 --> 01:53:53.750 align:start position:0%
 
thing

01:53:53.750 --> 01:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:55.510 --> 01:53:55.520 align:start position:0%
saying no further question I thank you
 
01:53:58.510 --> 01:53:58.520 align:start position:0%
for your testimony okay thank you
 
01:54:01.030 --> 01:54:01.040 align:start position:0%
anybody else wish to testify for or
 
01:54:03.030 --> 01:54:03.040 align:start position:0%
against House Bill

the committee uh representing the towns
 
03:34:28.910 --> 03:34:28.920 align:start position:0%
of Hampton Hampton Falls and Seabrook um
 
03:34:32.030 --> 03:34:32.040 align:start position:0%
I did um I'm here in support of the bill
 
03:34:34.269 --> 03:34:34.279 align:start position:0%
um although we did try to table the bill
 
03:34:36.510 --> 03:34:36.520 align:start position:0%
and and send it back to committee um I
 
03:34:37.870 --> 03:34:37.880 align:start position:0%
did go through the bill again and even
 
03:34:39.469 --> 03:34:39.479 align:start position:0%
talked with legislative services and a
 
03:34:40.990 --> 03:34:41.000 align:start position:0%
number of other people it is definitely
 
03:34:44.910 --> 03:34:44.920 align:start position:0%
a compromised bill um and I uh disagreed
 
03:34:47.510 --> 03:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
with with quite a few parts of it of the
 
03:34:50.150 --> 03:34:50.160 align:start position:0%
bill legalizing um I agree with the
 
03:34:53.150 --> 03:34:53.160 align:start position:0%
legalizing personal amounts um that Rel
 
03:34:54.950 --> 03:34:54.960 align:start position:0%
legalizing marijuana makes sense because
 
03:34:56.469 --> 03:34:56.479 align:start position:0%
we've had so many we've spent so much
 
03:35:00.309 --> 03:35:00.319 align:start position:0%
time on medical marijuana already um but
 
03:35:02.150 --> 03:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
I having gone through the bill I think
 
03:35:04.150 --> 03:35:04.160 align:start position:0%
that it overall is is a a step in the
 
03:35:07.469 --> 03:35:07.479 align:start position:0%
right direction so hold on one second I
 
03:35:09.269 --> 03:35:09.279 align:start position:0%
forgot to
 
03:35:12.990 --> 03:35:13.000 align:start position:0%
mention this hearing is ass soci is on
 
03:35:14.229 --> 03:35:14.239 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
03:35:17.790 --> 03:35:17.800 align:start position:0%
1598 but not on the policy the policy
 
03:35:23.349 --> 03:35:23.359 align:start position:0%
was set at Full House they voted out two
 
03:35:28.030 --> 03:35:28.040 align:start position:0%
to two to one and we're here today to
 
03:35:31.150 --> 03:35:31.160 align:start position:0%
look at the revenue and the
 
03:35:34.070 --> 03:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
appropriation piece of this so if you
 
03:35:36.630 --> 03:35:36.640 align:start position:0%
stick to the remarks dealing with those
 
03:35:39.389 --> 03:35:39.399 align:start position:0%
two things thank you right so that that
 
03:35:40.990 --> 03:35:41.000 align:start position:0%
was exactly what I was about to say say
 
03:35:42.309 --> 03:35:42.319 align:start position:0%
but much better than I could have said
 
03:35:45.150 --> 03:35:45.160 align:start position:0%
it um so on the the revenue question
 
03:35:48.229 --> 03:35:48.239 align:start position:0%
there's a the the question is how active
 
03:35:50.550 --> 03:35:50.560 align:start position:0%
should the state be involved in the sale
 
03:35:53.950 --> 03:35:53.960 align:start position:0%
and the administration of uh of this
 
03:35:56.950 --> 03:35:56.960 align:start position:0%
program if the committee is to amend it
 
03:35:59.189 --> 03:35:59.199 align:start position:0%
um uh you do cover the structure of the
 
03:36:01.469 --> 03:36:01.479 align:start position:0%
revenue portion of this so I would ask
 
03:36:03.550 --> 03:36:03.560 align:start position:0%
that uh if if the committee is willing
 
03:36:06.229 --> 03:36:06.239 align:start position:0%
to amend the bill to amend the bill to
 
03:36:07.950 --> 03:36:07.960 align:start position:0%
reduce the state's involvement and and
 
03:36:09.950 --> 03:36:09.960 align:start position:0%
prefer Private Sales rather than State
 
03:36:12.510 --> 03:36:12.520 align:start position:0%
involvement um and with that I I I would
 
03:36:13.710 --> 03:36:13.720 align:start position:0%
like to take questions but I'd have to
 
03:36:15.189 --> 03:36:15.199 align:start position:0%
take them by email because I have an
 
03:36:17.269 --> 03:36:17.279 align:start position:0%
executive session in a few minutes thank
 
03:36:24.790 --> 03:36:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:29.229 --> 03:36:29.239 align:start position:0%
abis the floor is now yours and
 
03:36:33.150 --> 03:36:33.160 align:start position:0%
concentrate on the revenue and the
 
03:36:37.950 --> 03:36:37.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:41.030 --> 03:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
chairman so if you if the fiscal note in
 
03:36:41.040 --> 03:36:42.229 align:start position:0%
chairman so if you if the fiscal note in
HB

03:36:42.229 --> 03:36:42.239 align:start position:0%
HB
 
03:36:44.510 --> 03:36:44.520 align:start position:0%
1598 there it was indeterminable what
 
03:36:47.110 --> 03:36:47.120 align:start position:0%
the re actual Revenue could be where
 
03:36:48.950 --> 03:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
some of the numbers I I use to just kind
 
03:36:50.710 --> 03:36:50.720 align:start position:0%
of come up with a ballpark was I
 
03:36:52.269 --> 03:36:52.279 align:start position:0%
referred to HB
 
03:36:54.950 --> 03:36:54.960 align:start position:0%
237 which was a bill that involved
 
03:36:57.389 --> 03:36:57.399 align:start position:0%
recreational Canabis as well uh it would
 
03:37:00.309 --> 03:37:00.319 align:start position:0%
have entailed a 5% transfer tax and a
 
03:37:04.110 --> 03:37:04.120 align:start position:0%
14% uh uh excuse me a 9% sales tax and a
 
03:37:06.750 --> 03:37:06.760 align:start position:0%
5% transfer tax I do have a print out of
 
03:37:08.150 --> 03:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
that fiscal note I can hand out to the
 
03:37:10.229 --> 03:37:10.239 align:start position:0%
committee if the members wish to take a
 
03:37:12.469 --> 03:37:12.479 align:start position:0%
look at it and that was a bill that the
 
03:37:14.429 --> 03:37:14.439 align:start position:0%
criminal justice Public Safety Committee
 
03:37:16.710 --> 03:37:16.720 align:start position:0%
had in uh before the committee this term
 
03:37:25.030 --> 03:37:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:29.790 --> 03:37:29.800 align:start position:0%
okay Jennifer could you help
 
03:37:32.510 --> 03:37:32.520 align:start position:0%
out and some of some of the estimates
 
03:37:35.150 --> 03:37:35.160 align:start position:0%
inside that fiscal note included the
 
03:37:39.389 --> 03:37:39.399 align:start position:0%
gross uh market
 
03:37:42.150 --> 03:37:42.160 align:start position:0%
sales and what I what I found very odd
 
03:37:44.710 --> 03:37:44.720 align:start position:0%
about the not odd but unique I guess
 
03:37:49.189 --> 03:37:49.199 align:start position:0%
is the gross legal sales was going to be
 
03:37:49.199 --> 03:37:51.269 align:start position:0%
is the gross legal sales was going to be
a

03:37:51.269 --> 03:37:51.279 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:37:55.469 --> 03:37:55.479 align:start position:0%
gross illegal sales can be $311 million
 
03:37:59.349 --> 03:37:59.359 align:start position:0%
that was the high high range estimate so
 
03:38:00.990 --> 03:38:01.000 align:start position:0%
as you see that a large portion of the
 
03:38:02.830 --> 03:38:02.840 align:start position:0%
market share could have been lost to the
 
03:38:04.469 --> 03:38:04.479 align:start position:0%
illegal sales I believe with this bill
 
03:38:08.670 --> 03:38:08.680 align:start position:0%
would do when you say the gross sales of
 
03:38:11.150 --> 03:38:11.160 align:start position:0%
$360 million
 
03:38:15.830 --> 03:38:15.840 align:start position:0%
that's not the profit is it it it is not
 
03:38:17.590 --> 03:38:17.600 align:start position:0%
the the point that I was making is that
 
03:38:20.630 --> 03:38:20.640 align:start position:0%
a large market share is lost to to an
 
03:38:22.710 --> 03:38:22.720 align:start position:0%
illegal Market about 40 to
 
03:38:25.950 --> 03:38:25.960 align:start position:0%
45% and that has to do with how the
 
03:38:29.070 --> 03:38:29.080 align:start position:0%
revenue is is uh made by the states that
 
03:38:30.469 --> 03:38:30.479 align:start position:0%
have allowed this and one of the
 
03:38:32.590 --> 03:38:32.600 align:start position:0%
problems that you've constantly seen is
 
03:38:36.349 --> 03:38:36.359 align:start position:0%
the over Taxation and overregulation
 
03:38:39.269 --> 03:38:39.279 align:start position:0%
what I believe 1598 does is that it
 
03:38:42.189 --> 03:38:42.199 align:start position:0%
doesn't actually have any tax and you
 
03:38:43.870 --> 03:38:43.880 align:start position:0%
can actually what would be done it would
 
03:38:45.990 --> 03:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
model exactly how revenue is made
 
03:38:48.269 --> 03:38:48.279 align:start position:0%
similar to that of liquor where the
 
03:38:50.150 --> 03:38:50.160 align:start position:0%
state is not taxing the sale of liquor
 
03:38:52.389 --> 03:38:52.399 align:start position:0%
the revenues made off the retail sale
 
03:38:55.269 --> 03:38:55.279 align:start position:0%
itself the advantage with cannabis on is
 
03:38:58.630 --> 03:38:58.640 align:start position:0%
that the markup is much higher on
 
03:39:01.110 --> 03:39:01.120 align:start position:0%
cannabis than it is with liquor so there
 
03:39:04.110 --> 03:39:04.120 align:start position:0%
is a chance to have a competit stay
 
03:39:05.750 --> 03:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
competitive with the illegal Market but
 
03:39:07.830 --> 03:39:07.840 align:start position:0%
also SE make a lot more Revenue than
 
03:39:11.389 --> 03:39:11.399 align:start position:0%
what the 14% tax would have done done
 
03:39:14.950 --> 03:39:14.960 align:start position:0%
the anticipated revenue from the sales
 
03:39:17.510 --> 03:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
tax and transfer tax version on a low
 
03:39:22.269 --> 03:39:22.279 align:start position:0%
point was 14 $14.4 million on a high
 
03:39:25.389 --> 03:39:25.399 align:start position:0%
point was $36 million so that comes to
 
03:39:27.670 --> 03:39:27.680 align:start position:0%
an uh an average you in the middle is
 
03:39:30.110 --> 03:39:30.120 align:start position:0%
about $25 million and I don't believe
 
03:39:31.910 --> 03:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
that that was a win for the state I
 
03:39:34.710 --> 03:39:34.720 align:start position:0%
believe under this proposal if you
 
03:39:36.389 --> 03:39:36.399 align:start position:0%
considered what the markup is on the
 
03:39:38.870 --> 03:39:38.880 align:start position:0%
wholesale price it would be seven eight
 
03:39:41.469 --> 03:39:41.479 align:start position:0%
times the amount of potential revenue
 
03:39:45.030 --> 03:39:45.040 align:start position:0%
for the state also hb2 237 did not take
 
03:39:47.309 --> 03:39:47.319 align:start position:0%
into consideration a significant out of
 
03:39:50.590 --> 03:39:50.600 align:start position:0%
state market share the liquor
 
03:39:53.830 --> 03:39:53.840 align:start position:0%
sales on average is about 40 to 50% out
 
03:39:56.349 --> 03:39:56.359 align:start position:0%
of state so whatever numbers these
 
03:39:59.309 --> 03:39:59.319 align:start position:0%
estimates come to is is actually very
 
03:40:01.590 --> 03:40:01.600 align:start position:0%
conservative considering the a ofate
 
03:40:04.429 --> 03:40:04.439 align:start position:0%
market is not really being Tak into
 
03:40:07.349 --> 03:40:07.359 align:start position:0%
consideration with those figures the
 
03:40:10.710 --> 03:40:10.720 align:start position:0%
retail industry Beyond just cannabis
 
03:40:12.990 --> 03:40:13.000 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire thrives on oate
 
03:40:15.309 --> 03:40:15.319 align:start position:0%
consumers coming to this state to
 
03:40:18.110 --> 03:40:18.120 align:start position:0%
purchase products to avoid a sales
 
03:40:20.229 --> 03:40:20.239 align:start position:0%
tax so there's no reason why we
 
03:40:22.590 --> 03:40:22.600 align:start position:0%
shouldn't consider those Market
 
03:40:24.670 --> 03:40:24.680 align:start position:0%
principles in the with the Cannabis
 
03:40:26.950 --> 03:40:26.960 align:start position:0%
industry the reason why I would oppose
 
03:40:30.510 --> 03:40:30.520 align:start position:0%
any type of actual sales tax or taxation
 
03:40:32.750 --> 03:40:32.760 align:start position:0%
on cannabis is I feel that
 
03:40:35.030 --> 03:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
would create a situation where the
 
03:40:37.630 --> 03:40:37.640 align:start position:0%
illegal Market would continue to Excel
 
03:40:39.670 --> 03:40:39.680 align:start position:0%
and you've seen a lot of states have
 
03:40:41.750 --> 03:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
made that is made that problem for
 
03:40:43.870 --> 03:40:43.880 align:start position:0%
themselves so I I would not support
 
03:40:45.670 --> 03:40:45.680 align:start position:0%
going down that same
 
03:40:48.309 --> 03:40:48.319 align:start position:0%
path as what to do with all that
 
03:40:51.189 --> 03:40:51.199 align:start position:0%
Revenue uh it was my anticipation that
 
03:40:53.189 --> 03:40:53.199 align:start position:0%
any of the revenue earned one any money
 
03:40:54.910 --> 03:40:54.920 align:start position:0%
that was drawn from the general fund to
 
03:40:57.189 --> 03:40:57.199 align:start position:0%
help facilitate this program should be
 
03:40:59.150 --> 03:40:59.160 align:start position:0%
repaid essentially the state would be
 
03:41:00.870 --> 03:41:00.880 align:start position:0%
taking a tax-free loan from the New
 
03:41:03.189 --> 03:41:03.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire taxpayer and I think the right
 
03:41:05.030 --> 03:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
thing to do would be first to pay that
 
03:41:07.910 --> 03:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
back but as to do with the net
 
03:41:10.469 --> 03:41:10.479 align:start position:0%
revenue the first $25 million dollars
 
03:41:14.150 --> 03:41:14.160 align:start position:0%
would go towards drug abuse uh alcohol
 
03:41:16.030 --> 03:41:16.040 align:start position:0%
abuse treatment any type of substance
 
03:41:18.229 --> 03:41:18.239 align:start position:0%
abuse treatment also mental health
 
03:41:20.229 --> 03:41:20.239 align:start position:0%
treatment that's related to substance
 
03:41:23.710 --> 03:41:23.720 align:start position:0%
abuse uh in my line in my uh line of
 
03:41:25.030 --> 03:41:25.040 align:start position:0%
work I interact with a lot of
 
03:41:27.389 --> 03:41:27.399 align:start position:0%
individuals who suffer from substance
 
03:41:31.189 --> 03:41:31.199 align:start position:0%
abuse issues and many of my clients
 
03:41:33.309 --> 03:41:33.319 align:start position:0%
without getting into the
 
03:41:35.469 --> 03:41:35.479 align:start position:0%
specifics uh suffer from untreated
 
03:41:38.590 --> 03:41:38.600 align:start position:0%
mental health issues that I often
 
03:41:40.149 --> 03:41:40.159 align:start position:0%
contribute to what leads them down on
 
03:41:43.469 --> 03:41:43.479 align:start position:0%
that path to substance abuse so
 
03:41:45.510 --> 03:41:45.520 align:start position:0%
investing the first $25 million in net
 
03:41:47.189 --> 03:41:47.199 align:start position:0%
revenue to help address that in our
 
03:41:50.309 --> 03:41:50.319 align:start position:0%
state I thought was the very important
 
03:41:54.429 --> 03:41:54.439 align:start position:0%
thing to do after that the uh 90% of of
 
03:41:55.750 --> 03:41:55.760 align:start position:0%
the net revenue would offset the
 
03:41:59.070 --> 03:41:59.080 align:start position:0%
Statewide education property tax I when
 
03:42:01.189 --> 03:42:01.199 align:start position:0%
I talk to constituents both in my
 
03:42:02.670 --> 03:42:02.680 align:start position:0%
district and then people throughout the
 
03:42:05.389 --> 03:42:05.399 align:start position:0%
state the two biggest complaints I hear
 
03:42:08.389 --> 03:42:08.399 align:start position:0%
are energy costs and property
 
03:42:10.630 --> 03:42:10.640 align:start position:0%
taxes although this doesn't address the
 
03:42:10.640 --> 03:42:11.710 align:start position:0%
taxes although this doesn't address the
energy

03:42:11.710 --> 03:42:11.720 align:start position:0%
energy
 
03:42:14.830 --> 03:42:14.840 align:start position:0%
issue this is this is addressing the
 
03:42:17.349 --> 03:42:17.359 align:start position:0%
property tax issue there's only so much
 
03:42:19.750 --> 03:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
we can do with the state level the
 
03:42:21.670 --> 03:42:21.680 align:start position:0%
property tax rate is often set at the
 
03:42:24.070 --> 03:42:24.080 align:start position:0%
local level same with the local
 
03:42:26.870 --> 03:42:26.880 align:start position:0%
education tax very limited what we can
 
03:42:29.189 --> 03:42:29.199 align:start position:0%
do with the county this is a real
 
03:42:32.429 --> 03:42:32.439 align:start position:0%
opportunity for us together to actually
 
03:42:35.070 --> 03:42:35.080 align:start position:0%
address the Statewide property tax issue
 
03:42:36.429 --> 03:42:36.439 align:start position:0%
and deliver that relief for the people
 
03:42:38.510 --> 03:42:38.520 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and I felt that if the
 
03:42:41.149 --> 03:42:41.159 align:start position:0%
state's going to get into this industry
 
03:42:41.159 --> 03:42:42.590 align:start position:0%
state's going to get into this industry
and

03:42:42.590 --> 03:42:42.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:42:46.149 --> 03:42:46.159 align:start position:0%
and get into the retail side of it my
 
03:42:47.750 --> 03:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
thought was that we should try to use
 
03:42:48.910 --> 03:42:48.920 align:start position:0%
that revenue and give it back to the
 
03:42:50.910 --> 03:42:50.920 align:start position:0%
people and this is one of the ways to do
 
03:42:53.389 --> 03:42:53.399 align:start position:0%
that and I've heard a lot of people talk
 
03:42:55.309 --> 03:42:55.319 align:start position:0%
about property tax relief I've been
 
03:42:57.750 --> 03:42:57.760 align:start position:0%
hearing it since I was a
 
03:43:00.269 --> 03:43:00.279 align:start position:0%
child and now I have children of my own
 
03:43:02.269 --> 03:43:02.279 align:start position:0%
and I no one this is our chance to
 
03:43:04.070 --> 03:43:04.080 align:start position:0%
actually do it and deliver on it it's
 
03:43:05.870 --> 03:43:05.880 align:start position:0%
not it's not just one person we have to
 
03:43:07.830 --> 03:43:07.840 align:start position:0%
do it together so I think this puts us
 
03:43:10.750 --> 03:43:10.760 align:start position:0%
in a very good position to do that
 
03:43:14.030 --> 03:43:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:15.910 --> 03:43:15.920 align:start position:0%
expenditures one of the issues that I
 
03:43:17.910 --> 03:43:17.920 align:start position:0%
would point out is the advertising
 
03:43:19.950 --> 03:43:19.960 align:start position:0%
expenditure was listed as a million
 
03:43:21.670 --> 03:43:21.680 align:start position:0%
dollars I would hope that the
 
03:43:23.429 --> 03:43:23.439 align:start position:0%
advertising for cannabis would be
 
03:43:25.990 --> 03:43:26.000 align:start position:0%
relative restrictive uh when you drive
 
03:43:27.229 --> 03:43:27.239 align:start position:0%
through Massachusetts you see these
 
03:43:29.950 --> 03:43:29.960 align:start position:0%
bright Billboards promoting
 
03:43:32.670 --> 03:43:32.680 align:start position:0%
cannabis I I think we don't really need
 
03:43:35.750 --> 03:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
that in this state I think the consumers
 
03:43:36.950 --> 03:43:36.960 align:start position:0%
are smart enough to know where to find
 
03:43:38.790 --> 03:43:38.800 align:start position:0%
it if they're looking for it if they're
 
03:43:41.349 --> 03:43:41.359 align:start position:0%
coming here they'll know I'm sure we'll
 
03:43:42.670 --> 03:43:42.680 align:start position:0%
get media coverage but we don't need to
 
03:43:45.469 --> 03:43:45.479 align:start position:0%
spend a million dollars on that so uh
 
03:43:48.389 --> 03:43:48.399 align:start position:0%
part of the appropriation that's set one
 
03:43:50.510 --> 03:43:50.520 align:start position:0%
big portion of there's about $7 million
 
03:43:51.750 --> 03:43:51.760 align:start position:0%
of that would be actually for the
 
03:43:54.229 --> 03:43:54.239 align:start position:0%
inventory cost to start up the retail
 
03:43:58.070 --> 03:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
side so I believe that's an important uh
 
03:43:59.229 --> 03:43:59.239 align:start position:0%
that's a kind of a going to be an
 
03:44:01.790 --> 03:44:01.800 align:start position:0%
expenditure that's continues but it's at
 
03:44:03.189 --> 03:44:03.199 align:start position:0%
the same time when as you're earning
 
03:44:05.790 --> 03:44:05.800 align:start position:0%
Revenue you can always uh you'll have to
 
03:44:11.309 --> 03:44:11.319 align:start position:0%
replace your inventory in respect to
 
03:44:14.389 --> 03:44:14.399 align:start position:0%
some of the other uh expenditures I know
 
03:44:15.710 --> 03:44:15.720 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of conversations
 
03:44:18.550 --> 03:44:18.560 align:start position:0%
about the potential for a State chared
 
03:44:22.269 --> 03:44:22.279 align:start position:0%
Bank the philosophy of that provision is
 
03:44:24.550 --> 03:44:24.560 align:start position:0%
and the way I I read the the language is
 
03:44:26.309 --> 03:44:26.319 align:start position:0%
that the Private Industry will have
 
03:44:28.870 --> 03:44:28.880 align:start position:0%
every opportunity to address the banking
 
03:44:31.630 --> 03:44:31.640 align:start position:0%
needs of both the state as well as the
 
03:44:33.070 --> 03:44:33.080 align:start position:0%
private cultivators the private
 
03:44:36.269 --> 03:44:36.279 align:start position:0%
manufacturers and the private testing
 
03:44:38.750 --> 03:44:38.760 align:start position:0%
facilities however if a private
 
03:44:40.429 --> 03:44:40.439 align:start position:0%
institution is unable ble to fulfill the
 
03:44:43.229 --> 03:44:43.239 align:start position:0%
needs of the state the the second option
 
03:44:45.550 --> 03:44:45.560 align:start position:0%
the plan B as I call it would be the
 
03:44:48.950 --> 03:44:48.960 align:start position:0%
state Chartered Bank uh from what I've
 
03:44:51.269 --> 03:44:51.279 align:start position:0%
heard and conversations I've had with
 
03:44:53.229 --> 03:44:53.239 align:start position:0%
many people that there's financial
 
03:44:55.429 --> 03:44:55.439 align:start position:0%
institutions that are available that are
 
03:44:58.750 --> 03:44:58.760 align:start position:0%
willing to to uh accommodate the state's
 
03:45:00.790 --> 03:45:00.800 align:start position:0%
needs so I don't see Plan B being a
 
03:45:02.670 --> 03:45:02.680 align:start position:0%
problem but I don't understand why we
 
03:45:04.510 --> 03:45:04.520 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want a backup plan we don't
 
03:45:06.950 --> 03:45:06.960 align:start position:0%
want this being a cash industry we keep
 
03:45:08.349 --> 03:45:08.359 align:start position:0%
talking about the revenue revenue
 
03:45:10.710 --> 03:45:10.720 align:start position:0%
revenue I mean do want to keep it in a
 
03:45:12.510 --> 03:45:12.520 align:start position:0%
in a a lock box or a
 
03:45:15.110 --> 03:45:15.120 align:start position:0%
safe that that doesn't seem that doesn't
 
03:45:18.590 --> 03:45:18.600 align:start position:0%
seem how it should be done so I would
 
03:45:20.790 --> 03:45:20.800 align:start position:0%
hope that we keep the plan B available
 
03:45:22.750 --> 03:45:22.760 align:start position:0%
but I really hope a private institution
 
03:45:25.550 --> 03:45:25.560 align:start position:0%
does step up and handle that u in
 
03:45:27.309 --> 03:45:27.319 align:start position:0%
respect to some of the startup costs as
 
03:45:30.910 --> 03:45:30.920 align:start position:0%
well I know we have a u we already have
 
03:45:33.750 --> 03:45:33.760 align:start position:0%
an industry for medical cannabis there
 
03:45:35.429 --> 03:45:35.439 align:start position:0%
was some conversations about whether the
 
03:45:37.710 --> 03:45:37.720 align:start position:0%
medical industry would ever be able to
 
03:45:39.710 --> 03:45:39.720 align:start position:0%
help sell their products to the state
 
03:45:42.950 --> 03:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
State uh one advantage of that is that
 
03:45:43.910 --> 03:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
they're already up and running and
 
03:45:46.590 --> 03:45:46.600 align:start position:0%
there's some they would be less less of
 
03:45:48.429 --> 03:45:48.439 align:start position:0%
the startup cost in the oversight cost
 
03:45:49.550 --> 03:45:49.560 align:start position:0%
because they're already established
 
03:45:51.630 --> 03:45:51.640 align:start position:0%
Enterprises so I wouldn't have any issue
 
03:45:52.950 --> 03:45:52.960 align:start position:0%
with that
 
03:45:55.110 --> 03:45:55.120 align:start position:0%
provided the integration that may be a
 
03:45:56.990 --> 03:45:57.000 align:start position:0%
little more difficult and I just made it
 
03:45:58.870 --> 03:45:58.880 align:start position:0%
sound but that seems like something that
 
03:46:00.229 --> 03:46:00.239 align:start position:0%
could actually make it easier for the
 
03:46:02.469 --> 03:46:02.479 align:start position:0%
state to get this up and running and at
 
03:46:03.790 --> 03:46:03.800 align:start position:0%
the same
 
03:46:06.070 --> 03:46:06.080 align:start position:0%
time there when it comes to it's not
 
03:46:08.189 --> 03:46:08.199 align:start position:0%
just the cultivation side it's also the
 
03:46:10.590 --> 03:46:10.600 align:start position:0%
manufacturing side testing side they
 
03:46:12.950 --> 03:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
have that industry somewhat they've
 
03:46:14.229 --> 03:46:14.239 align:start position:0%
mastered their business plan so that
 
03:46:15.590 --> 03:46:15.600 align:start position:0%
would actually be beneficial to the
 
03:46:16.950 --> 03:46:16.960 align:start position:0%
state at least take into consideration
 
03:46:19.149 --> 03:46:19.159 align:start position:0%
that policy as well may save us some of
 
03:46:21.030 --> 03:46:21.040 align:start position:0%
the startup costs that we're concerned
 
03:46:22.910 --> 03:46:22.920 align:start position:0%
about and I'll answer any questions
 
03:46:26.309 --> 03:46:26.319 align:start position:0%
anyone has thank you represent
 
03:46:29.710 --> 03:46:29.720 align:start position:0%
abis representative Bry actually I got
 
03:46:31.790 --> 03:46:31.800 align:start position:0%
three initial questions I actually more
 
03:46:36.349 --> 03:46:36.359 align:start position:0%
than that but we start with the three um
 
03:46:39.110 --> 03:46:39.120 align:start position:0%
first you clarify this right up front
 
03:46:41.870 --> 03:46:41.880 align:start position:0%
our Ed edbl in this bill or
 
03:46:44.630 --> 03:46:44.640 align:start position:0%
not so what are you talking about the
 
03:46:47.110 --> 03:46:47.120 align:start position:0%
edible products well we we have I mean
 
03:46:49.229 --> 03:46:49.239 align:start position:0%
there manufacturing all throughout this
 
03:46:50.830 --> 03:46:50.840 align:start position:0%
so you're going to license companies to
 
03:46:52.349 --> 03:46:52.359 align:start position:0%
manufacture which assumes that they'll
 
03:46:55.229 --> 03:46:55.239 align:start position:0%
be edibles but then when I look at when
 
03:46:59.910 --> 03:46:59.920 align:start position:0%
I look at page three under possession
 
03:47:03.630 --> 03:47:03.640 align:start position:0%
limits uh page uh go to line 19 on page
 
03:47:05.710 --> 03:47:05.720 align:start position:0%
three it says cannabis infused products
 
03:47:08.670 --> 03:47:08.680 align:start position:0%
contain containing THC purchased from
 
03:47:10.750 --> 03:47:10.760 align:start position:0%
retail cannabis stores which I'm
 
03:47:13.110 --> 03:47:13.120 align:start position:0%
assuming the state stores which shall be
 
03:47:16.229 --> 03:47:16.239 align:start position:0%
limited to medical use
 
03:47:18.950 --> 03:47:18.960 align:start position:0%
only for which the the purchaser
 
03:47:20.910 --> 03:47:20.920 align:start position:0%
presents documentation printing use of
 
03:47:23.870 --> 03:47:23.880 align:start position:0%
cannabis for medical purposes and which
 
03:47:26.349 --> 03:47:26.359 align:start position:0%
shall not contain more than two Gams of
 
03:47:29.269 --> 03:47:29.279 align:start position:0%
THC so I'm confused by why this is even
 
03:47:32.229 --> 03:47:32.239 align:start position:0%
in here I mean we have seven stores we
 
03:47:33.910 --> 03:47:33.920 align:start position:0%
have seven
 
03:47:38.670 --> 03:47:38.680 align:start position:0%
atc's um that are uh you know that they
 
03:47:40.590 --> 03:47:40.600 align:start position:0%
do all three things they they produce
 
03:47:43.710 --> 03:47:43.720 align:start position:0%
they grow they they create Edibles they
 
03:47:46.269 --> 03:47:46.279 align:start position:0%
manufacture and then they also sell
 
03:47:49.149 --> 03:47:49.159 align:start position:0%
retail so just answer my qu I mean
 
03:47:51.189 --> 03:47:51.199 align:start position:0%
please let me know are Edibles in here
 
03:47:52.750 --> 03:47:52.760 align:start position:0%
because it's a very important part of
 
03:47:56.070 --> 03:47:56.080 align:start position:0%
estimating revenues is is Edibles going
 
03:47:58.469 --> 03:47:58.479 align:start position:0%
to be in is Edibles in this spill or
 
03:48:00.550 --> 03:48:00.560 align:start position:0%
eliminated from The Spill as written
 
03:48:02.590 --> 03:48:02.600 align:start position:0%
Edibles would be sold through the state
 
03:48:04.269 --> 03:48:04.279 align:start position:0%
retail store but however it would still
 
03:48:07.389 --> 03:48:07.399 align:start position:0%
be limited for medical use only wow that
 
03:48:09.590 --> 03:48:09.600 align:start position:0%
was and that that restriction was part
 
03:48:12.070 --> 03:48:12.080 align:start position:0%
of a a bigger compromise uh there was a
 
03:48:14.269 --> 03:48:14.279 align:start position:0%
lot of a lot of compromises made
 
03:48:17.229 --> 03:48:17.239 align:start position:0%
throughout the 17 pages of so so what
 
03:48:19.790 --> 03:48:19.800 align:start position:0%
we're saying is that the only I'm not
 
03:48:21.590 --> 03:48:21.600 align:start position:0%
quite sure how that's going to work in a
 
03:48:24.550 --> 03:48:24.560 align:start position:0%
store um I'm I'm here for recreational
 
03:48:26.830 --> 03:48:26.840 align:start position:0%
use we see the product on the
 
03:48:29.189 --> 03:48:29.199 align:start position:0%
shelves that are Edibles which you as
 
03:48:31.389 --> 03:48:31.399 align:start position:0%
you know are very popular a lot of
 
03:48:33.830 --> 03:48:33.840 align:start position:0%
customers are going to buy edibles but
 
03:48:34.910 --> 03:48:34.920 align:start position:0%
we're going to say we're only going to
 
03:48:37.070 --> 03:48:37.080 align:start position:0%
limit that edible sales to people who
 
03:48:39.670 --> 03:48:39.680 align:start position:0%
have a medical card is that correct
 
03:48:41.229 --> 03:48:41.239 align:start position:0%
that's that's my understanding of how it
 
03:48:42.990 --> 03:48:43.000 align:start position:0%
how it is written all right and that's
 
03:48:46.349 --> 03:48:46.359 align:start position:0%
about a 30% market share and my concern
 
03:48:48.269 --> 03:48:48.279 align:start position:0%
with with eliminating Edibles completely
 
03:48:50.389 --> 03:48:50.399 align:start position:0%
is there's also I don't know if vaping
 
03:48:53.229 --> 03:48:53.239 align:start position:0%
is the right term to use when but in
 
03:48:54.349 --> 03:48:54.359 align:start position:0%
order for The Vaping side of the
 
03:48:56.389 --> 03:48:56.399 align:start position:0%
industry to survive you may need to have
 
03:48:59.309 --> 03:48:59.319 align:start position:0%
the Edibles to I think it's a you you
 
03:49:00.910 --> 03:49:00.920 align:start position:0%
may need those for in order for that to
 
03:49:03.469 --> 03:49:03.479 align:start position:0%
work otherwise that's kind of a product
 
03:49:05.750 --> 03:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
but and the markup on Edibles is much
 
03:49:08.590 --> 03:49:08.600 align:start position:0%
higher than the flower right so this
 
03:49:10.670 --> 03:49:10.680 align:start position:0%
this brings us back to revenue estimates
 
03:49:16.950 --> 03:49:16.960 align:start position:0%
Mr chair so follow up on on um so most
 
03:49:19.990 --> 03:49:20.000 align:start position:0%
most States Edibles are sold at all
 
03:49:22.670 --> 03:49:22.680 align:start position:0%
states Edibles are sold in stores so
 
03:49:25.349 --> 03:49:25.359 align:start position:0%
going back to your your Revenue estimate
 
03:49:27.790 --> 03:49:27.800 align:start position:0%
I mean first off I mean you handed us
 
03:49:30.070 --> 03:49:30.080 align:start position:0%
this uh do you have an actual number
 
03:49:31.790 --> 03:49:31.800 align:start position:0%
that you want to throw out for what we
 
03:49:33.790 --> 03:49:33.800 align:start position:0%
because this is what we have to try to
 
03:49:35.830 --> 03:49:35.840 align:start position:0%
understand how much what's the net going
 
03:49:38.110 --> 03:49:38.120 align:start position:0%
to be for running these stores Just Like
 
03:49:39.950 --> 03:49:39.960 align:start position:0%
Liquor we get the net
 
03:49:42.710 --> 03:49:42.720 align:start position:0%
the profit of of the after all the
 
03:49:44.870 --> 03:49:44.880 align:start position:0%
expenses so so the number I when I was
 
03:49:47.030 --> 03:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
talking about uh if you can the markup
 
03:49:49.429 --> 03:49:49.439 align:start position:0%
can be seven eight times an amount I was
 
03:49:51.030 --> 03:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
I'm strictly referring just to the
 
03:49:53.309 --> 03:49:53.319 align:start position:0%
flower I'm trying to keep the numbers as
 
03:49:54.990 --> 03:49:55.000 align:start position:0%
conservative as possible I I don't want
 
03:49:57.830 --> 03:49:57.840 align:start position:0%
to misrepresent or explain something
 
03:49:59.229 --> 03:49:59.239 align:start position:0%
that's going to be much say it's going
 
03:50:01.229 --> 03:50:01.239 align:start position:0%
to be you know half a billion dollars
 
03:50:03.070 --> 03:50:03.080 align:start position:0%
and it and all of a sudden if it comes
 
03:50:04.830 --> 03:50:04.840 align:start position:0%
in below that it it
 
03:50:07.189 --> 03:50:07.199 align:start position:0%
seems but my understanding the markup on
 
03:50:10.910 --> 03:50:10.920 align:start position:0%
on the Edibles is close to 150% to 200%
 
03:50:12.670 --> 03:50:12.680 align:start position:0%
depends on the volume but it can be much
 
03:50:15.710 --> 03:50:15.720 align:start position:0%
higher I don't know the markup on The
 
03:50:18.110 --> 03:50:18.120 align:start position:0%
Vaping version of that but it is higher
 
03:50:19.790 --> 03:50:19.800 align:start position:0%
than the flowers so the numbers I gave
 
03:50:21.830 --> 03:50:21.840 align:start position:0%
are relative they're very conservative
 
03:50:24.309 --> 03:50:24.319 align:start position:0%
numbers and I use everything against
 
03:50:27.110 --> 03:50:27.120 align:start position:0%
against the my own interest in trying to
 
03:50:29.510 --> 03:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
sell the revenue okay just on your what
 
03:50:32.189 --> 03:50:32.199 align:start position:0%
you just hand it out I'm trying Mr are
 
03:50:34.590 --> 03:50:34.600 align:start position:0%
we talking the 13 million to 30 million
 
03:50:36.469 --> 03:50:36.479 align:start position:0%
is that what what we're looking at what
 
03:50:38.189 --> 03:50:38.199 align:start position:0%
what I'm trying to understand what your
 
03:50:40.189 --> 03:50:40.199 align:start position:0%
what you think the Net's going to be
 
03:50:43.070 --> 03:50:43.080 align:start position:0%
if if I had my own estimation I think
 
03:50:45.750 --> 03:50:45.760 align:start position:0%
once the if there's 10 retail stores up
 
03:50:47.630 --> 03:50:47.640 align:start position:0%
and running not counting any of the
 
03:50:50.269 --> 03:50:50.279 align:start position:0%
revenue from from the cultivators and
 
03:50:51.910 --> 03:50:51.920 align:start position:0%
Manufacturing because they those
 
03:50:53.469 --> 03:50:53.479 align:start position:0%
entities will still be private and
 
03:50:55.269 --> 03:50:55.279 align:start position:0%
they'll be paying the business profits
 
03:50:58.189 --> 03:50:58.199 align:start position:0%
tax and uh business Enterprise tax
 
03:51:00.910 --> 03:51:00.920 align:start position:0%
that's not included either I would
 
03:51:02.790 --> 03:51:02.800 align:start position:0%
anticipate it would come in around 250
 
03:51:05.910 --> 03:51:05.920 align:start position:0%
to 300 million at a low point and again
 
03:51:07.910 --> 03:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
that that's it's really difficult to
 
03:51:10.030 --> 03:51:10.040 align:start position:0%
estimate what the
 
03:51:12.309 --> 03:51:12.319 align:start position:0%
offset from the illegal Market would be
 
03:51:13.870 --> 03:51:13.880 align:start position:0%
because that may take some time for that
 
03:51:13.880 --> 03:51:15.189 align:start position:0%
because that may take some time for that
to

03:51:15.189 --> 03:51:15.199 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:51:19.189 --> 03:51:19.199 align:start position:0%
slowly uh dissipate and I just I'm I'm
 
03:51:21.389 --> 03:51:21.399 align:start position:0%
using conventional knowledge here that
 
03:51:22.910 --> 03:51:22.920 align:start position:0%
if you can buy a product off the shelf
 
03:51:24.469 --> 03:51:24.479 align:start position:0%
that's clean and labeled for a
 
03:51:26.429 --> 03:51:26.439 align:start position:0%
competitive price it wouldn't really
 
03:51:28.790 --> 03:51:28.800 align:start position:0%
make a lot of sense to go buy the same
 
03:51:30.990 --> 03:51:31.000 align:start position:0%
buy a product off the in the illegal
 
03:51:36.429 --> 03:51:36.439 align:start position:0%
market right is that just the marijuana
 
03:51:37.910 --> 03:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
without the
 
03:51:41.030 --> 03:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
Edibles so 250 to
 
03:51:43.990 --> 03:51:44.000 align:start position:0%
300 I'm I'm basing that on just just the
 
03:51:46.550 --> 03:51:46.560 align:start position:0%
flower markup again I did not count the
 
03:51:49.269 --> 03:51:49.279 align:start position:0%
edibles but the the fiscal note from 237
 
03:51:51.070 --> 03:51:51.080 align:start position:0%
didn't distinguish
 
03:51:54.510 --> 03:51:54.520 align:start position:0%
between a flower or it didn't it didn't
 
03:51:55.990 --> 03:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
distinguish between the flow the Edibles
 
03:51:58.349 --> 03:51:58.359 align:start position:0%
or any manufactured products what that
 
03:52:01.389 --> 03:52:01.399 align:start position:0%
was basing it on was the the sales a 14%
 
03:52:03.349 --> 03:52:03.359 align:start position:0%
tax it would have been a 5% transfer tax
 
03:52:06.670 --> 03:52:06.680 align:start position:0%
and then a 9% sales tax so on that
 
03:52:09.269 --> 03:52:09.279 align:start position:0%
transfer tax and sales tax it didn't the
 
03:52:10.670 --> 03:52:10.680 align:start position:0%
number didn't distinguish one or the
 
03:52:13.030 --> 03:52:13.040 align:start position:0%
other but if we're not taxing it and
 
03:52:14.950 --> 03:52:14.960 align:start position:0%
we're basing it on a markup from the
 
03:52:17.670 --> 03:52:17.680 align:start position:0%
wholesale price if the markup on Edibles
 
03:52:21.550 --> 03:52:21.560 align:start position:0%
is 150% it's going to be
 
03:52:23.389 --> 03:52:23.399 align:start position:0%
you're how how many times you're
 
03:52:26.910 --> 03:52:26.920 align:start position:0%
doubling 14% right off the bat follow up
 
03:52:29.110 --> 03:52:29.120 align:start position:0%
I got one more and then and a lot others
 
03:52:33.750 --> 03:52:33.760 align:start position:0%
um so you you mentioned advertising uh I
 
03:52:35.950 --> 03:52:35.960 align:start position:0%
agree we shouldn't be advertising but
 
03:52:38.149 --> 03:52:38.159 align:start position:0%
the Liquor Commission does big- time
 
03:52:40.110 --> 03:52:40.120 align:start position:0%
advertising and other states especially
 
03:52:41.670 --> 03:52:41.680 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts I talked to the
 
03:52:42.910 --> 03:52:42.920 align:start position:0%
commissioner about
 
03:52:46.590 --> 03:52:46.600 align:start position:0%
this uh to to draw those customers in
 
03:52:49.229 --> 03:52:49.239 align:start position:0%
and it's fine because you can advertise
 
03:52:50.990 --> 03:52:51.000 align:start position:0%
because you can buy the product here and
 
03:52:53.349 --> 03:52:53.359 align:start position:0%
take it across back across the border
 
03:52:55.429 --> 03:52:55.439 align:start position:0%
but the state's not going to do that the
 
03:52:58.269 --> 03:52:58.279 align:start position:0%
state can't advertise across the border
 
03:52:59.990 --> 03:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
because technically it's not a bit good
 
03:53:02.349 --> 03:53:02.359 align:start position:0%
look for the state to do that because
 
03:53:03.469 --> 03:53:03.479 align:start position:0%
you're saying to customers from
 
03:53:06.750 --> 03:53:06.760 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts come here and take it home
 
03:53:08.550 --> 03:53:08.560 align:start position:0%
but that's illegal to do that Crossing
 
03:53:11.349 --> 03:53:11.359 align:start position:0%
back across the border
 
03:53:15.710 --> 03:53:15.720 align:start position:0%
so I I think in our
 
03:53:17.910 --> 03:53:17.920 align:start position:0%
estimating the numb is going to actually
 
03:53:19.469 --> 03:53:19.479 align:start position:0%
we're not going to get the same out
 
03:53:21.710 --> 03:53:21.720 align:start position:0%
ofate I mean there still be some out of
 
03:53:23.389 --> 03:53:23.399 align:start position:0%
Staters are going to buy here if the
 
03:53:25.670 --> 03:53:25.680 align:start position:0%
price it's all going to be price driven
 
03:53:26.710 --> 03:53:26.720 align:start position:0%
that they're going to come but I don't
 
03:53:28.830 --> 03:53:28.840 align:start position:0%
think the state can advertise that way I
 
03:53:30.389 --> 03:53:30.399 align:start position:0%
mean would you agree with
 
03:53:33.750 --> 03:53:33.760 align:start position:0%
that good whether that's a good decision
 
03:53:35.910 --> 03:53:35.920 align:start position:0%
or not is not a decision for me myself
 
03:53:38.070 --> 03:53:38.080 align:start position:0%
to make I think what I this bill does is
 
03:53:40.550 --> 03:53:40.560 align:start position:0%
puts the trust in Judgment of that into
 
03:53:43.110 --> 03:53:43.120 align:start position:0%
the The Liquor Commission I will say
 
03:53:46.149 --> 03:53:46.159 align:start position:0%
that Canabis is against federal law and
 
03:53:47.510 --> 03:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
I've taken the position we're either
 
03:53:50.110 --> 03:53:50.120 align:start position:0%
going to abide by the federal law or
 
03:53:52.149 --> 03:53:52.159 align:start position:0%
we're going to ignore it and what I am
 
03:53:53.269 --> 03:53:53.279 align:start position:0%
recommending is if we're going to go
 
03:53:55.030 --> 03:53:55.040 align:start position:0%
down this rout we just ignore it
 
03:53:57.389 --> 03:53:57.399 align:start position:0%
including how we generate the revenue
 
03:53:58.630 --> 03:53:58.640 align:start position:0%
how we Market
 
03:54:00.910 --> 03:54:00.920 align:start position:0%
it and that's how that's how it works
 
03:54:03.189 --> 03:54:03.199 align:start position:0%
the federal government has completely I
 
03:54:04.550 --> 03:54:04.560 align:start position:0%
would say failed the entire country on
 
03:54:06.429 --> 03:54:06.439 align:start position:0%
this issue they've sat on it and let it
 
03:54:09.110 --> 03:54:09.120 align:start position:0%
become what it is today where you can't
 
03:54:11.910 --> 03:54:11.920 align:start position:0%
interstate commerce it's a come of cash
 
03:54:14.510 --> 03:54:14.520 align:start position:0%
industry for tax filing purposes they
 
03:54:16.070 --> 03:54:16.080 align:start position:0%
they for a while I'm not sure if they
 
03:54:19.149 --> 03:54:19.159 align:start position:0%
can even offset their expenses the way
 
03:54:21.349 --> 03:54:21.359 align:start position:0%
so unfortunately there's a lot of
 
03:54:22.630 --> 03:54:22.640 align:start position:0%
problems with the federal government but
 
03:54:25.349 --> 03:54:25.359 align:start position:0%
I'm recommending as if since that
 
03:54:26.990 --> 03:54:27.000 align:start position:0%
they're in action I'm going to assume
 
03:54:28.910 --> 03:54:28.920 align:start position:0%
they're can to continue their in action
 
03:54:29.990 --> 03:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you for answering
 
03:54:31.429 --> 03:54:31.439 align:start position:0%
my questions appreciate it before we go
 
03:54:33.269 --> 03:54:33.279 align:start position:0%
on another question essentially what
 
03:54:36.189 --> 03:54:36.199 align:start position:0%
you're saying is since the federal
 
03:54:38.910 --> 03:54:38.920 align:start position:0%
government hasn't been acting we just
 
03:54:40.550 --> 03:54:40.560 align:start position:0%
ignore federal
 
03:54:42.510 --> 03:54:42.520 align:start position:0%
government well cannabis is against
 
03:54:42.520 --> 03:54:43.469 align:start position:0%
government well cannabis is against
federal

03:54:43.469 --> 03:54:43.479 align:start position:0%
federal
 
03:54:46.830 --> 03:54:46.840 align:start position:0%
law it so and it's against federal law
 
03:54:50.550 --> 03:54:50.560 align:start position:0%
for medical use so if if we do
 
03:54:52.830 --> 03:54:52.840 align:start position:0%
this and the federal government doesn't
 
03:54:52.840 --> 03:54:54.149 align:start position:0%
this and the federal government doesn't
step

03:54:54.149 --> 03:54:54.159 align:start position:0%
step
 
03:55:00.149 --> 03:55:00.159 align:start position:0%
in and let's say i' help us if somebody
 
03:55:03.389 --> 03:55:03.399 align:start position:0%
dies because of the product that we
 
03:55:06.710 --> 03:55:06.720 align:start position:0%
sell and they take it to federal
 
03:55:10.510 --> 03:55:10.520 align:start position:0%
court now the courts different
 
03:55:13.429 --> 03:55:13.439 align:start position:0%
would the court ignore federal law in
 
03:55:13.439 --> 03:55:14.429 align:start position:0%
would the court ignore federal law in
their

03:55:14.429 --> 03:55:14.439 align:start position:0%
their
 
03:55:16.590 --> 03:55:16.600 align:start position:0%
decision when when it say goes to court
 
03:55:17.630 --> 03:55:17.640 align:start position:0%
are you talk about a criminal
 
03:55:22.830 --> 03:55:22.840 align:start position:0%
prosecution or or a civil case both well
 
03:55:24.349 --> 03:55:24.359 align:start position:0%
look at it this way if it's for a civil
 
03:55:27.110 --> 03:55:27.120 align:start position:0%
case if you make the comparison to
 
03:55:29.269 --> 03:55:29.279 align:start position:0%
alcohol you can then if there's
 
03:55:31.070 --> 03:55:31.080 align:start position:0%
negligence or whether someone's over
 
03:55:34.189 --> 03:55:34.199 align:start position:0%
served or it was distributed to a
 
03:55:36.269 --> 03:55:36.279 align:start position:0%
minor in that case there still can be
 
03:55:37.630 --> 03:55:37.640 align:start position:0%
civil liability even though the product
 
03:55:39.469 --> 03:55:39.479 align:start position:0%
is legal so I would assume a there would
 
03:55:40.950 --> 03:55:40.960 align:start position:0%
be a civil case whether in state court
 
03:55:43.910 --> 03:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
or federal court as for the criminal
 
03:55:46.830 --> 03:55:46.840 align:start position:0%
prosecution yeah I mean that's up to I
 
03:55:47.750 --> 03:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
don't want to I don't want to tell
 
03:55:48.990 --> 03:55:49.000 align:start position:0%
someone they're not it's not going to
 
03:55:51.389 --> 03:55:51.399 align:start position:0%
happen but you can literally go on your
 
03:55:52.710 --> 03:55:52.720 align:start position:0%
through a Fidelity account on your cell
 
03:55:54.110 --> 03:55:54.120 align:start position:0%
phone and buy shares on a cannabis
 
03:55:56.189 --> 03:55:56.199 align:start position:0%
company on the New York Stock Exchange
 
03:55:57.590 --> 03:55:57.600 align:start position:0%
so if the federal government decides
 
03:55:59.070 --> 03:55:59.080 align:start position:0%
that we're going to now prosecute this
 
03:56:00.030 --> 03:56:00.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is not going to be the
 
03:56:02.590 --> 03:56:02.600 align:start position:0%
only state that's going to have issues
 
03:56:04.110 --> 03:56:04.120 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of that's going to be a
 
03:56:07.510 --> 03:56:07.520 align:start position:0%
very large trickle down effect and the
 
03:56:09.550 --> 03:56:09.560 align:start position:0%
government has sent out memor
 
03:56:11.950 --> 03:56:11.960 align:start position:0%
randoms to different agencies advising
 
03:56:14.429 --> 03:56:14.439 align:start position:0%
them to not enforce cannabis laws so I
 
03:56:16.389 --> 03:56:16.399 align:start position:0%
think the preemption argument in the
 
03:56:19.389 --> 03:56:19.399 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court made that decision just to
 
03:56:21.510 --> 03:56:21.520 align:start position:0%
touch on that subject that's back when
 
03:56:23.510 --> 03:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
they were still the DEA was still
 
03:56:26.630 --> 03:56:26.640 align:start position:0%
shutting down the retail stores when you
 
03:56:28.630 --> 03:56:28.640 align:start position:0%
when you send out a memor memorandum
 
03:56:30.830 --> 03:56:30.840 align:start position:0%
saying to not enforce the law well that
 
03:56:32.710 --> 03:56:32.720 align:start position:0%
shows an intent to no longer control it
 
03:56:34.510 --> 03:56:34.520 align:start position:0%
so that I would I would say that whole
 
03:56:36.670 --> 03:56:36.680 align:start position:0%
case is right for review from the at the
 
03:56:38.990 --> 03:56:39.000 align:start position:0%
federal level but I I'm predicting that
 
03:56:40.910 --> 03:56:40.920 align:start position:0%
the federal prohibition will
 
03:56:42.990 --> 03:56:43.000 align:start position:0%
eventually uh go away I know there's a
 
03:56:44.590 --> 03:56:44.600 align:start position:0%
bill right now being held in in the
 
03:56:45.990 --> 03:56:46.000 align:start position:0%
United States Senate but it hasn't been
 
03:56:47.510 --> 03:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
acted on
 
03:56:51.550 --> 03:56:51.560 align:start position:0%
yet thank you uh questions the committee
 
03:56:51.560 --> 03:56:59.269 align:start position:0%
yet thank you uh questions the committee
representative

03:56:59.269 --> 03:56:59.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:04.550 --> 03:57:04.560 align:start position:0%
elme sorry I'm trying to oh on I have
 
03:57:07.030 --> 03:57:07.040 align:start position:0%
been B blissfully ignoring this whole
 
03:57:09.030 --> 03:57:09.040 align:start position:0%
argument for quite a while except for
 
03:57:12.269 --> 03:57:12.279 align:start position:0%
when I had to vote on the floor um what
 
03:57:15.309 --> 03:57:15.319 align:start position:0%
do you mean by the markup is based on
 
03:57:18.630 --> 03:57:18.640 align:start position:0%
the flower do you mean the
 
03:57:26.990 --> 03:57:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:29.510 --> 03:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
flower when I was trying to figure out
 
03:57:31.670 --> 03:57:31.680 align:start position:0%
that what what the markup is when the
 
03:57:33.750 --> 03:57:33.760 align:start position:0%
farmer or the cultivator takes the
 
03:57:36.030 --> 03:57:36.040 align:start position:0%
flower and then it's sold in a retail
 
03:57:39.510 --> 03:57:39.520 align:start position:0%
store what is the markup in in price
 
03:57:40.750 --> 03:57:40.760 align:start position:0%
I've been given a lot of a lot of
 
03:57:42.870 --> 03:57:42.880 align:start position:0%
different numbers the range I've gotten
 
03:57:45.750 --> 03:57:45.760 align:start position:0%
has been from 80% some say 60% it
 
03:57:48.670 --> 03:57:48.680 align:start position:0%
depends on the volume but I've heard as
 
03:57:50.750 --> 03:57:50.760 align:start position:0%
high as 120% it also depends on the
 
03:57:53.110 --> 03:57:53.120 align:start position:0%
strain which I'm not as familiar with
 
03:57:55.429 --> 03:57:55.439 align:start position:0%
that that the scientific side of that
 
03:57:57.830 --> 03:57:57.840 align:start position:0%
but it really there's a lot of depends I
 
03:58:00.030 --> 03:58:00.040 align:start position:0%
just been using the number 80 to 90%
 
03:58:02.149 --> 03:58:02.159 align:start position:0%
because that's kind of the middle ground
 
03:58:03.790 --> 03:58:03.800 align:start position:0%
so again trying to be as conservative
 
03:58:06.790 --> 03:58:06.800 align:start position:0%
I'm not taking the 120% because I
 
03:58:09.990 --> 03:58:10.000 align:start position:0%
again could I follow CU I still don't
 
03:58:13.750 --> 03:58:13.760 align:start position:0%
quite understand so so what the farmer
 
03:58:15.750 --> 03:58:15.760 align:start position:0%
sells the flower
 
03:58:21.110 --> 03:58:21.120 align:start position:0%
for versus what the product at the end
 
03:58:23.349 --> 03:58:23.359 align:start position:0%
is which sometimes is just a bag of
 
03:58:26.309 --> 03:58:26.319 align:start position:0%
flowers that have been dried but
 
03:58:30.389 --> 03:58:30.399 align:start position:0%
sometimes is a very complicated edible
 
03:58:33.030 --> 03:58:33.040 align:start position:0%
or the liquid for
 
03:58:37.070 --> 03:58:37.080 align:start position:0%
vaping and those Transformations cost
 
03:58:41.870 --> 03:58:41.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:44.149 --> 03:58:44.159 align:start position:0%
so in the industry there's the
 
03:58:46.229 --> 03:58:46.239 align:start position:0%
cultivation side when I say use the term
 
03:58:48.950 --> 03:58:48.960 align:start position:0%
manufacturing that is the entity or
 
03:58:51.950 --> 03:58:51.960 align:start position:0%
individual that's making the the Edibles
 
03:58:54.070 --> 03:58:54.080 align:start position:0%
or The Vaping products
 
03:58:57.309 --> 03:58:57.319 align:start position:0%
so in the medical industry what we have
 
03:58:59.750 --> 03:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
here the cultivator the manufacturer and
 
03:59:01.750 --> 03:59:01.760 align:start position:0%
the retails really the
 
03:59:01.760 --> 03:59:04.110 align:start position:0%
the retails really the
same

03:59:04.110 --> 03:59:04.120 align:start position:0%
same
 
03:59:06.229 --> 03:59:06.239 align:start position:0%
entity in depending on which state you
 
03:59:07.950 --> 03:59:07.960 align:start position:0%
look at some some states follow that
 
03:59:09.710 --> 03:59:09.720 align:start position:0%
some states they're
 
03:59:12.030 --> 03:59:12.040 align:start position:0%
separate I have no the way this is
 
03:59:13.269 --> 03:59:13.279 align:start position:0%
written that I don't see why a
 
03:59:15.110 --> 03:59:15.120 align:start position:0%
manufacturer and a cultivator has to be
 
03:59:17.870 --> 03:59:17.880 align:start position:0%
separate but they can be so when I'm
 
03:59:19.790 --> 03:59:19.800 align:start position:0%
talking about the flower being sold it's
 
03:59:22.830 --> 03:59:22.840 align:start position:0%
now being sold at the retail level so if
 
03:59:25.030 --> 03:59:25.040 align:start position:0%
the cultivator sold it to the state to
 
03:59:27.670 --> 03:59:27.680 align:start position:0%
sell it when I ask how much is the
 
03:59:30.070 --> 03:59:30.080 align:start position:0%
markup but when I'm given those numbers
 
03:59:31.550 --> 03:59:31.560 align:start position:0%
part of the issue is is that sometimes
 
03:59:32.910 --> 03:59:32.920 align:start position:0%
the cultivating the retailer even if
 
03:59:34.110 --> 03:59:34.120 align:start position:0%
they're a separate entity it's still the
 
03:59:38.710 --> 03:59:38.720 align:start position:0%
same owner so how those numbers are are
 
03:59:40.349 --> 03:59:40.359 align:start position:0%
come up with sometimes has to do with
 
03:59:42.429 --> 03:59:42.439 align:start position:0%
the fact that the industry is somewhat
 
03:59:45.030 --> 03:59:45.040 align:start position:0%
marginalized by the federal restrictions
 
03:59:46.910 --> 03:59:46.920 align:start position:0%
or due to the inaction of the federal
 
03:59:48.870 --> 03:59:48.880 align:start position:0%
government to actually remove the
 
03:59:48.880 --> 03:59:49.990 align:start position:0%
government to actually remove the
federal

03:59:49.990 --> 03:59:50.000 align:start position:0%
federal
 
03:59:51.870 --> 03:59:51.880 align:start position:0%
prohibition but that's where I got the
 
03:59:54.030 --> 03:59:54.040 align:start position:0%
that's where I got that number from but
 
03:59:58.870 --> 03:59:58.880 align:start position:0%
in sorry follow up follow up on in most
 
04:00:02.070 --> 04:00:02.080 align:start position:0%
cases isn't there what you're calling
 
04:00:04.950 --> 04:00:04.960 align:start position:0%
the markup a considerable part of that
 
04:00:11.469 --> 04:00:11.479 align:start position:0%
is the the transport shipping drying
 
04:00:16.469 --> 04:00:16.479 align:start position:0%
modifying packaging Etc the costs of it
 
04:00:18.510 --> 04:00:18.520 align:start position:0%
and and it would depend on what when you
 
04:00:20.710 --> 04:00:20.720 align:start position:0%
say flower form you can buy it I mean
 
04:00:23.590 --> 04:00:23.600 align:start position:0%
you can buy tobacco right now just in a
 
04:00:26.870 --> 04:00:26.880 align:start position:0%
pouch you can buy it in a in a smaller
 
04:00:28.349 --> 04:00:28.359 align:start position:0%
poch that's meant for chewing tobacco
 
04:00:30.429 --> 04:00:30.439 align:start position:0%
you can buy it so you can smoke tobacco
 
04:00:33.710 --> 04:00:33.720 align:start position:0%
out of a pipe you can buy uh cigarettes
 
04:00:35.750 --> 04:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
that are already pre-rolled cannabis is
 
04:00:37.389 --> 04:00:37.399 align:start position:0%
following I don't believe there's many
 
04:00:38.950 --> 04:00:38.960 align:start position:0%
chewing products
 
04:00:41.790 --> 04:00:41.800 align:start position:0%
but you can buy cannabis products that
 
04:00:43.670 --> 04:00:43.680 align:start position:0%
are already rolled and again there's
 
04:00:46.429 --> 04:00:46.439 align:start position:0%
those are those markups so again it
 
04:00:47.750 --> 04:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
really it really depends on what you're
 
04:00:50.870 --> 04:00:50.880 align:start position:0%
buying so when I say 80% it it's again
 
04:00:52.870 --> 04:00:52.880 align:start position:0%
that's just kind of a rough estimation
 
04:00:54.790 --> 04:00:54.800 align:start position:0%
because each product is going to have
 
04:00:57.990 --> 04:00:58.000 align:start position:0%
its own individual markup and then it
 
04:01:00.030 --> 04:01:00.040 align:start position:0%
also depends on the strain the quality
 
04:01:02.630 --> 04:01:02.640 align:start position:0%
the reason why Edibles is higher is that
 
04:01:04.990 --> 04:01:05.000 align:start position:0%
Edibles are from what I understand when
 
04:01:07.630 --> 04:01:07.640 align:start position:0%
they make those handrolled products what
 
04:01:09.309 --> 04:01:09.319 align:start position:0%
happens is
 
04:01:11.389 --> 04:01:11.399 align:start position:0%
the waste product is is actually used to
 
04:01:12.910 --> 04:01:12.920 align:start position:0%
make the
 
04:01:15.790 --> 04:01:15.800 align:start position:0%
Edibles so sometimes with something that
 
04:01:17.550 --> 04:01:17.560 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't normally be able to sell as
 
04:01:19.550 --> 04:01:19.560 align:start position:0%
a flower you then can now use that in
 
04:01:22.309 --> 04:01:22.319 align:start position:0%
the manufactured product so that's one
 
04:01:25.750 --> 04:01:25.760 align:start position:0%
of the benefits of allowing that side of
 
04:01:25.760 --> 04:01:28.870 align:start position:0%
of the benefits of allowing that side of
the

04:01:28.870 --> 04:01:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:31.630 --> 04:01:31.640 align:start position:0%
industry represent
 
04:01:33.990 --> 04:01:34.000 align:start position:0%
yearly thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
04:01:37.229 --> 04:01:37.239 align:start position:0%
taking my question Mr
 
04:01:41.990 --> 04:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
chair um I got a a couple here um the
 
04:01:45.630 --> 04:01:45.640 align:start position:0%
taxing process I'm I'm unclear on this
 
04:01:48.229 --> 04:01:48.239 align:start position:0%
is this a vat type tax so if there's an
 
04:01:52.389 --> 04:01:52.399 align:start position:0%
excise tax or a sales tax on every stage
 
04:01:54.950 --> 04:01:54.960 align:start position:0%
in the process or
 
04:01:58.349 --> 04:01:58.359 align:start position:0%
not there are no taxes that are in this
 
04:02:00.110 --> 04:02:00.120 align:start position:0%
and if there was any taxes I I would
 
04:02:02.710 --> 04:02:02.720 align:start position:0%
likely withdraw my support for it so you
 
04:02:05.630 --> 04:02:05.640 align:start position:0%
so it's only the retail the followup
 
04:02:08.790 --> 04:02:08.800 align:start position:0%
follow so the retail sale
 
04:02:11.110 --> 04:02:11.120 align:start position:0%
is to the benefit of it so there's no
 
04:02:15.550 --> 04:02:15.560 align:start position:0%
tax for uh uh other than the license
 
04:02:18.630 --> 04:02:18.640 align:start position:0%
fees for the manufacturer for the
 
04:02:24.189 --> 04:02:24.199 align:start position:0%
transportation for the uh um uh transfer
 
04:02:28.149 --> 04:02:28.159 align:start position:0%
to uh pouches for retail sellers
 
04:02:31.229 --> 04:02:31.239 align:start position:0%
no there there are no taxes but the the
 
04:02:33.510 --> 04:02:33.520 align:start position:0%
manufacturer the cultivate they would
 
04:02:35.630 --> 04:02:35.640 align:start position:0%
still have the be subject to the you
 
04:02:38.510 --> 04:02:38.520 align:start position:0%
know bet in the business profit STX they
 
04:02:39.750 --> 04:02:39.760 align:start position:0%
would still be taxed just like they were
 
04:02:41.990 --> 04:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
any other business operating in the
 
04:02:44.750 --> 04:02:44.760 align:start position:0%
State uh thank you on that another
 
04:02:48.910 --> 04:02:48.920 align:start position:0%
question Mr chair follow up thank you um
 
04:02:53.710 --> 04:02:53.720 align:start position:0%
so the Cannabis control fund or a board
 
04:02:56.469 --> 04:02:56.479 align:start position:0%
would be setting the price for sale is
 
04:02:56.479 --> 04:02:58.469 align:start position:0%
would be setting the price for sale is
that

04:02:58.469 --> 04:02:58.479 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:03:01.030 --> 04:03:01.040 align:start position:0%
correct I I believe the when you say the
 
04:03:02.110 --> 04:03:02.120 align:start position:0%
sale you're talking about the retail
 
04:03:04.630 --> 04:03:04.640 align:start position:0%
sale retail yeah that would be something
 
04:03:06.590 --> 04:03:06.600 align:start position:0%
that I would I would believe the Liquor
 
04:03:07.870 --> 04:03:07.880 align:start position:0%
Commission would set just like they do
 
04:03:09.590 --> 04:03:09.600 align:start position:0%
with liquor sold in the liquor store
 
04:03:12.429 --> 04:03:12.439 align:start position:0%
they would need to use their expertise
 
04:03:15.550 --> 04:03:15.560 align:start position:0%
on really what is the price point to to
 
04:03:17.229 --> 04:03:17.239 align:start position:0%
affect the sale to make it affordable
 
04:03:19.309 --> 04:03:19.319 align:start position:0%
and to deal with all the other potential
 
04:03:20.790 --> 04:03:20.800 align:start position:0%
mitigating problems such as the illegal
 
04:03:22.790 --> 04:03:22.800 align:start position:0%
market and to attract out of state
 
04:03:26.630 --> 04:03:26.640 align:start position:0%
consumers okay so another followup sir
 
04:03:29.309 --> 04:03:29.319 align:start position:0%
follow up so the Liquor Commission sets
 
04:03:30.429 --> 04:03:30.439 align:start position:0%
the price to
 
04:03:30.439 --> 04:03:32.149 align:start position:0%
the price to
sell

04:03:32.149 --> 04:03:32.159 align:start position:0%
sell
 
04:03:36.189 --> 04:03:36.199 align:start position:0%
and of that a certain amount and you're
 
04:03:39.030 --> 04:03:39.040 align:start position:0%
you're saying here on uh page 8
 
04:03:44.030 --> 04:03:44.040 align:start position:0%
uh line 26 $25 million of that has to go
 
04:03:46.870 --> 04:03:46.880 align:start position:0%
to the Cannabis control fund so the
 
04:03:46.880 --> 04:03:49.229 align:start position:0%
to the Cannabis control fund so the
question

04:03:49.229 --> 04:03:49.239 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:03:53.229 --> 04:03:53.239 align:start position:0%
is if $25 million isn't made where is
 
04:03:55.790 --> 04:03:55.800 align:start position:0%
the $25 million dollar come
 
04:04:01.269 --> 04:04:01.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:04.990 --> 04:04:05.000 align:start position:0%
fund and on page eight uh line 26 the
 
04:04:08.550 --> 04:04:08.560 align:start position:0%
sum of 25 million annually uh
 
04:04:11.670 --> 04:04:11.680 align:start position:0%
so if before that that section it's
 
04:04:14.309 --> 04:04:14.319 align:start position:0%
referencing the net revenue so you would
 
04:04:15.830 --> 04:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
need to that would need to be they would
 
04:04:17.910 --> 04:04:17.920 align:start position:0%
need to be a net revenue in the first
 
04:04:20.870 --> 04:04:20.880 align:start position:0%
place if and I pray this doesn't happen
 
04:04:22.870 --> 04:04:22.880 align:start position:0%
but if there wasn't a net revenue then
 
04:04:25.030 --> 04:04:25.040 align:start position:0%
that money would not you would not
 
04:04:26.630 --> 04:04:26.640 align:start position:0%
invoked that
 
04:04:26.640 --> 04:04:29.590 align:start position:0%
invoked that
paragraph

04:04:29.590 --> 04:04:29.600 align:start position:0%
paragraph
 
04:04:34.349 --> 04:04:34.359 align:start position:0%
So follow so if I follow up Mr chair
 
04:04:37.070 --> 04:04:37.080 align:start position:0%
follow up so if I understand what you
 
04:04:40.269 --> 04:04:40.279 align:start position:0%
just said was the funding for the
 
04:04:43.790 --> 04:04:43.800 align:start position:0%
Cannabis control fund is contingent upon
 
04:04:46.790 --> 04:04:46.800 align:start position:0%
sales first so the first dollar would go
 
04:04:48.790 --> 04:04:48.800 align:start position:0%
into the Cannabis control fund and after
 
04:04:52.910 --> 04:04:52.920 align:start position:0%
the Cannabis the 75% to 25% and and all
 
04:04:55.670 --> 04:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
the things that follows are set across
 
04:05:00.670 --> 04:05:00.680 align:start position:0%
then every other dollar would to go to
 
04:05:05.590 --> 04:05:05.600 align:start position:0%
the um general fund or for as as a
 
04:05:09.030 --> 04:05:09.040 align:start position:0%
profit is am I saying this correctly so
 
04:05:10.950 --> 04:05:10.960 align:start position:0%
all all the money would go into the the
 
04:05:13.550 --> 04:05:13.560 align:start position:0%
Cannabis control fund from the sales it
 
04:05:15.950 --> 04:05:15.960 align:start position:0%
all goes into to the same fund but
 
04:05:17.550 --> 04:05:17.560 align:start position:0%
there's there's operating cost there's
 
04:05:19.790 --> 04:05:19.800 align:start position:0%
oversight cost there's cost for
 
04:05:22.990 --> 04:05:23.000 align:start position:0%
employees there's there's cost for doing
 
04:05:25.790 --> 04:05:25.800 align:start position:0%
business so the net re when I'm
 
04:05:27.269 --> 04:05:27.279 align:start position:0%
referring to what to do with the net
 
04:05:30.429 --> 04:05:30.439 align:start position:0%
revenue that's that's where when I and
 
04:05:31.550 --> 04:05:31.560 align:start position:0%
where I came up with this as an
 
04:05:33.790 --> 04:05:33.800 align:start position:0%
important side is I remember in my first
 
04:05:37.469 --> 04:05:37.479 align:start position:0%
term last uh last term I read through
 
04:05:39.349 --> 04:05:39.359 align:start position:0%
the citizen counsel ARR
 
04:05:42.790 --> 04:05:42.800 align:start position:0%
and yes the overwhelming majority of of
 
04:05:45.110 --> 04:05:45.120 align:start position:0%
uh the people from New Hampshire who
 
04:05:46.309 --> 04:05:46.319 align:start position:0%
participate in the survey support
 
04:05:48.429 --> 04:05:48.439 align:start position:0%
recreational Cannabis a lot of comments
 
04:05:51.550 --> 04:05:51.560 align:start position:0%
were for the revenue purposes and that's
 
04:05:53.469 --> 04:05:53.479 align:start position:0%
where I I I said that to me the biggest
 
04:05:55.990 --> 04:05:56.000 align:start position:0%
part of any recreational policy is the
 
04:05:58.309 --> 04:05:58.319 align:start position:0%
revenue side of it because that's what I
 
04:06:00.110 --> 04:06:00.120 align:start position:0%
hear from the people of New Hampshire
 
04:06:03.469 --> 04:06:03.479 align:start position:0%
are concerned with so the net revenue
 
04:06:06.469 --> 04:06:06.479 align:start position:0%
that is the first 25 million in the net
 
04:06:09.830 --> 04:06:09.840 align:start position:0%
revenue will be paid to DHHS to deal
 
04:06:12.149 --> 04:06:12.159 align:start position:0%
with drug treatment substance abuse
 
04:06:12.159 --> 04:06:13.910 align:start position:0%
with drug treatment substance abuse
treatment

04:06:13.910 --> 04:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
04:06:16.710 --> 04:06:16.720 align:start position:0%
prevention to try to in intervene and
 
04:06:19.030 --> 04:06:19.040 align:start position:0%
really focus on drugs that can lead to
 
04:06:20.990 --> 04:06:21.000 align:start position:0%
overdoses that lead to that lead to
 
04:06:22.830 --> 04:06:22.840 align:start position:0%
Deaths we still have an opioid issue as
 
04:06:25.910 --> 04:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
well so this would at least try to take
 
04:06:27.710 --> 04:06:27.720 align:start position:0%
as many preventive me measures as
 
04:06:28.990 --> 04:06:29.000 align:start position:0%
possible and mitigate some of the
 
04:06:32.670 --> 04:06:32.680 align:start position:0%
potential negative impacts uh on society
 
04:06:33.990 --> 04:06:34.000 align:start position:0%
that a recreational policy could bring
 
04:06:34.000 --> 04:06:34.910 align:start position:0%
that a recreational policy could bring
with

04:06:34.910 --> 04:06:34.920 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:06:38.630 --> 04:06:38.640 align:start position:0%
it represent L followed by represent
 
04:06:39.990 --> 04:06:40.000 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm I'm going to stick with
 
04:06:41.229 --> 04:06:41.239 align:start position:0%
this money theme because I want to I
 
04:06:42.670 --> 04:06:42.680 align:start position:0%
want to it's really the reason we're
 
04:06:44.189 --> 04:06:44.199 align:start position:0%
here which starts on page eight in this
 
04:06:45.830 --> 04:06:45.840 align:start position:0%
Canabis control fund is while you're in
 
04:06:47.910 --> 04:06:47.920 align:start position:0%
front of the ways and meanss committee
 
04:06:49.510 --> 04:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
um and and and I guess I'm going to ask
 
04:06:50.990 --> 04:06:51.000 align:start position:0%
a really long-winded question which
 
04:06:53.309 --> 04:06:53.319 align:start position:0%
isn't uncommon for a politician but I'm
 
04:06:54.870 --> 04:06:54.880 align:start position:0%
going to ask a long-winded question try
 
04:06:56.750 --> 04:06:56.760 align:start position:0%
to see if I understand the money flow to
 
04:06:59.710 --> 04:06:59.720 align:start position:0%
make sure we're clear um so I understand
 
04:07:01.510 --> 04:07:01.520 align:start position:0%
the bill so the first thing that happens
 
04:07:03.830 --> 04:07:03.840 align:start position:0%
is the state the the money that goes
 
04:07:05.750 --> 04:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
into the Cannabis control fund is really
 
04:07:07.830 --> 04:07:07.840 align:start position:0%
differential it's the profits right so
 
04:07:09.990 --> 04:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
it's the it's the net profits of the
 
04:07:11.830 --> 04:07:11.840 align:start position:0%
sale from the state liquor from the
 
04:07:14.830 --> 04:07:14.840 align:start position:0%
state Cannabis stores um after uh would
 
04:07:17.630 --> 04:07:17.640 align:start position:0%
go all of the money would go into the
 
04:07:20.590 --> 04:07:20.600 align:start position:0%
Cannabis fund is that
 
04:07:23.309 --> 04:07:23.319 align:start position:0%
correct all the all every dollar from
 
04:07:25.389 --> 04:07:25.399 align:start position:0%
every penny from every sale right is
 
04:07:27.149 --> 04:07:27.159 align:start position:0%
going it will go into that fun yes so
 
04:07:28.950 --> 04:07:28.960 align:start position:0%
the followup so if I can it's going to
 
04:07:30.349 --> 04:07:30.359 align:start position:0%
be kind of a series to walk through the
 
04:07:31.950 --> 04:07:31.960 align:start position:0%
money to make sure I understand it
 
04:07:33.870 --> 04:07:33.880 align:start position:0%
correctly cut you off cut me off one if
 
04:07:36.710 --> 04:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
you want Mr chair you usually do
 
04:07:40.189 --> 04:07:40.199 align:start position:0%
um uh so there's there's an initial uh
 
04:07:42.269 --> 04:07:42.279 align:start position:0%
appropriation in this bill of $14
 
04:07:45.309 --> 04:07:45.319 align:start position:0%
million to basically to get the the the
 
04:07:47.710 --> 04:07:47.720 align:start position:0%
stores and the and the hiring and all of
 
04:07:49.149 --> 04:07:49.159 align:start position:0%
that kind of stuff off the ground is
 
04:07:52.469 --> 04:07:52.479 align:start position:0%
that correct correct and then the first
 
04:07:53.990 --> 04:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
thing we pay back because that's general
 
04:07:55.630 --> 04:07:55.640 align:start position:0%
fund money is out of the Cannabis funds
 
04:07:57.990 --> 04:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
is that $14 million we pay that back
 
04:07:59.189 --> 04:07:59.199 align:start position:0%
because that's basically coming from the
 
04:08:00.910 --> 04:08:00.920 align:start position:0%
taxpayers so the first portion of the
 
04:08:03.309 --> 04:08:03.319 align:start position:0%
funding after we've netted out the
 
04:08:04.429 --> 04:08:04.439 align:start position:0%
profits right we've paid our
 
04:08:06.710 --> 04:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
administrative cost as we pay uh you
 
04:08:08.149 --> 04:08:08.159 align:start position:0%
know for all of our employees that may
 
04:08:10.469 --> 04:08:10.479 align:start position:0%
be needed for this we would pay back
 
04:08:12.870 --> 04:08:12.880 align:start position:0%
that $14 million to the state taxpayers
 
04:08:14.590 --> 04:08:14.600 align:start position:0%
to make sure there was no impact for
 
04:08:17.550 --> 04:08:17.560 align:start position:0%
starting this program correct thank you
 
04:08:19.590 --> 04:08:19.600 align:start position:0%
once we've done that and we've corrected
 
04:08:22.109 --> 04:08:22.119 align:start position:0%
the for we've we've paid the $4 million
 
04:08:24.750 --> 04:08:24.760 align:start position:0%
the secondary next set of funding that I
 
04:08:27.070 --> 04:08:27.080 align:start position:0%
see in here goes to Health and Human
 
04:08:30.309 --> 04:08:30.319 align:start position:0%
Services for cessation programs um a
 
04:08:31.630 --> 04:08:31.640 align:start position:0%
again we're talking about after we've
 
04:08:33.429 --> 04:08:33.439 align:start position:0%
paid off we take the administrative
 
04:08:35.269 --> 04:08:35.279 align:start position:0%
costs out we've now paid off the $4
 
04:08:37.630 --> 04:08:37.640 align:start position:0%
million firsttime funds and we're now
 
04:08:39.710 --> 04:08:39.720 align:start position:0%
just to the administrative costs and the
 
04:08:41.950 --> 04:08:41.960 align:start position:0%
net profit from that would be go to the
 
04:08:44.109 --> 04:08:44.119 align:start position:0%
first bite of the Apple would go to HHS
 
04:08:46.189 --> 04:08:46.199 align:start position:0%
for cation
 
04:08:50.309 --> 04:08:50.319 align:start position:0%
programs that that's correct um the next
 
04:08:52.510 --> 04:08:52.520 align:start position:0%
thing that happens after that if we have
 
04:08:54.910 --> 04:08:54.920 align:start position:0%
net revenues and net profits beyond the
 
04:08:57.070 --> 04:08:57.080 align:start position:0%
administrative cost beyond the $25
 
04:08:59.349 --> 04:08:59.359 align:start position:0%
million the next set of funding is
 
04:09:01.950 --> 04:09:01.960 align:start position:0%
broken up into two pieces if I'm not the
 
04:09:05.469 --> 04:09:05.479 align:start position:0%
way I read this um the first set would
 
04:09:08.070 --> 04:09:08.080 align:start position:0%
go to um
 
04:09:10.070 --> 04:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
would go to offset the Statewide
 
04:09:12.469 --> 04:09:12.479 align:start position:0%
education property tax is that correct
 
04:09:14.030 --> 04:09:14.040 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry three pieces the first one
 
04:09:14.990 --> 04:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
would go to
 
04:09:17.830 --> 04:09:17.840 align:start position:0%
the there there is three three so the
 
04:09:20.550 --> 04:09:20.560 align:start position:0%
first 90% of the overage after we've
 
04:09:22.229 --> 04:09:22.239 align:start position:0%
taken care of the Statewide property tax
 
04:09:25.510 --> 04:09:25.520 align:start position:0%
and and paid that off 100% um the the
 
04:09:29.269 --> 04:09:29.279 align:start position:0%
money would then go to to um I'm sorry
 
04:09:30.389 --> 04:09:30.399 align:start position:0%
the money would then go to the property
 
04:09:33.630 --> 04:09:33.640 align:start position:0%
tax after this after DHHS that's correct
 
04:09:36.109 --> 04:09:36.119 align:start position:0%
and then we have two more segments of it
 
04:09:39.830 --> 04:09:39.840 align:start position:0%
5% of it would go to uh law enforcement
 
04:09:41.950 --> 04:09:41.960 align:start position:0%
to help with training
 
04:09:44.189 --> 04:09:44.199 align:start position:0%
programs that's correct and then the
 
04:09:47.590 --> 04:09:47.600 align:start position:0%
next 5% toal equal 100% of the overage
 
04:09:49.429 --> 04:09:49.439 align:start position:0%
after Statewide property tax didn't care
 
04:09:51.790 --> 04:09:51.800 align:start position:0%
would be would go to or after uh the
 
04:09:53.990 --> 04:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
money would go to Children's behavioral
 
04:09:55.630 --> 04:09:55.640 align:start position:0%
health programs is that correct as part
 
04:09:55.640 --> 04:09:56.790 align:start position:0%
health programs is that correct as part
of

04:09:56.790 --> 04:09:56.800 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:10:00.670 --> 04:10:00.680 align:start position:0%
DHHS that's correct
 
04:10:03.269 --> 04:10:03.279 align:start position:0%
okay again all of this funding though is
 
04:10:05.429 --> 04:10:05.439 align:start position:0%
contingent Bond the sale price right so
 
04:10:06.469 --> 04:10:06.479 align:start position:0%
it's a differential between the
 
04:10:08.189 --> 04:10:08.199 align:start position:0%
wholesale price the sale price the
 
04:10:10.510 --> 04:10:10.520 align:start position:0%
administrative cost to to manage all of
 
04:10:12.950 --> 04:10:12.960 align:start position:0%
that and it's the profitability so to
 
04:10:15.309 --> 04:10:15.319 align:start position:0%
speak that pays for all of that funding
 
04:10:17.269 --> 04:10:17.279 align:start position:0%
there's no tax so to speak into it it's
 
04:10:17.279 --> 04:10:18.149 align:start position:0%
there's no tax so to speak into it it's
about

04:10:18.149 --> 04:10:18.159 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:10:21.349 --> 04:10:21.359 align:start position:0%
profitability that's correct thank
 
04:10:24.590 --> 04:10:24.600 align:start position:0%
you represent hat thank you Mr chair if
 
04:10:28.109 --> 04:10:28.119 align:start position:0%
I may I may have a followup or two um
 
04:10:30.750 --> 04:10:30.760 align:start position:0%
Contin continue dialogue and my concern
 
04:10:33.790 --> 04:10:33.800 align:start position:0%
is just towards the uh amounts of money
 
04:10:37.109 --> 04:10:37.119 align:start position:0%
being asked for okay so um thank you and
 
04:10:38.710 --> 04:10:38.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for for taking my testimony I
 
04:10:40.469 --> 04:10:40.479 align:start position:0%
guess I guess to start with the
 
04:10:40.479 --> 04:10:42.109 align:start position:0%
guess I guess to start with the
beginning

04:10:42.109 --> 04:10:42.119 align:start position:0%
beginning
 
04:10:46.349 --> 04:10:46.359 align:start position:0%
um where was the $25 million where was
 
04:10:49.269 --> 04:10:49.279 align:start position:0%
that figure derived from or how did how
 
04:10:52.469 --> 04:10:52.479 align:start position:0%
was $25 million determined to be an
 
04:10:54.349 --> 04:10:54.359 align:start position:0%
appropriate amount of money to be
 
04:10:59.109 --> 04:10:59.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:01.630 --> 04:11:01.640 align:start position:0%
purpose it was debated
 
04:11:03.790 --> 04:11:03.800 align:start position:0%
heavily and I just when I call it the
 
04:11:06.550 --> 04:11:06.560 align:start position:0%
Brain Trust that's not an official club
 
04:11:08.149 --> 04:11:08.159 align:start position:0%
by any means but when we El kind of
 
04:11:11.030 --> 04:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
talking about what to do uh we felt that
 
04:11:12.750 --> 04:11:12.760 align:start position:0%
the and one of the biggest concerns that
 
04:11:14.349 --> 04:11:14.359 align:start position:0%
people have had and expressed about any
 
04:11:17.429 --> 04:11:17.439 align:start position:0%
type of 1598 aside any type of
 
04:11:20.149 --> 04:11:20.159 align:start position:0%
recreational canas policy there are a
 
04:11:21.510 --> 04:11:21.520 align:start position:0%
lot of people that believe it's still a
 
04:11:23.269 --> 04:11:23.279 align:start position:0%
gateway drug and they believes that this
 
04:11:25.630 --> 04:11:25.640 align:start position:0%
leads down a path where of substance
 
04:11:28.670 --> 04:11:28.680 align:start position:0%
abuse issues and we thought that it was
 
04:11:32.469 --> 04:11:32.479 align:start position:0%
important that really make put a make a
 
04:11:35.389 --> 04:11:35.399 align:start position:0%
conscious effort to try to reduce that
 
04:11:37.590 --> 04:11:37.600 align:start position:0%
the extent that you believe that to
 
04:11:40.630 --> 04:11:40.640 align:start position:0%
reduce that that from happening but also
 
04:11:42.070 --> 04:11:42.080 align:start position:0%
even if you don't believe that there's
 
04:11:44.990 --> 04:11:45.000 align:start position:0%
still other drugs that are causing over
 
04:11:46.830 --> 04:11:46.840 align:start position:0%
that people die from in their overdoses
 
04:11:49.030 --> 04:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
and that people are physically addicted
 
04:11:51.910 --> 04:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
to uh such as an opioid where your body
 
04:11:54.790 --> 04:11:54.800 align:start position:0%
has physical withdrawal symptoms that to
 
04:11:56.670 --> 04:11:56.680 align:start position:0%
address those situations so we really
 
04:11:59.189 --> 04:11:59.199 align:start position:0%
that was the number we came up with and
 
04:12:03.149 --> 04:12:03.159 align:start position:0%
I haven't heard uh any any the only
 
04:12:04.269 --> 04:12:04.279 align:start position:0%
objection is every want to know how we
 
04:12:05.990 --> 04:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
kind of came up with it some people had
 
04:12:08.389 --> 04:12:08.399 align:start position:0%
a higher figure I felt that if that
 
04:12:10.269 --> 04:12:10.279 align:start position:0%
number was going to be any higher that
 
04:12:13.109 --> 04:12:13.119 align:start position:0%
DHHS would uh they would need to
 
04:12:15.269 --> 04:12:15.279 align:start position:0%
Advocate and convince the legislator to
 
04:12:17.229 --> 04:12:17.239 align:start position:0%
go any higher than that but I think that
 
04:12:19.109 --> 04:12:19.119 align:start position:0%
when it comes to drug overdoses and Drug
 
04:12:20.750 --> 04:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
prevention we really want to do
 
04:12:22.149 --> 04:12:22.159 align:start position:0%
everything we can to to prevent that
 
04:12:24.790 --> 04:12:24.800 align:start position:0%
from happening especially to our youth
 
04:12:26.670 --> 04:12:26.680 align:start position:0%
so if any May Mr I I don't disagree with
 
04:12:28.950 --> 04:12:28.960 align:start position:0%
that at all but then again we're talking
 
04:12:31.389 --> 04:12:31.399 align:start position:0%
about a sum of $25 million which is
 
04:12:33.309 --> 04:12:33.319 align:start position:0%
substantial in this state and don't
 
04:12:34.830 --> 04:12:34.840 align:start position:0%
misunderstand me I'm not saying I'm
 
04:12:36.950 --> 04:12:36.960 align:start position:0%
opposed to this but we're asking for an
 
04:12:40.510 --> 04:12:40.520 align:start position:0%
appr roation we're from finance and we
 
04:12:41.910 --> 04:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
need to
 
04:12:44.309 --> 04:12:44.319 align:start position:0%
understand why that amount of money is
 
04:12:47.670 --> 04:12:47.680 align:start position:0%
being asked for is there is it was it uh
 
04:12:50.189 --> 04:12:50.199 align:start position:0%
suggested by an entity that deals with
 
04:12:52.469 --> 04:12:52.479 align:start position:0%
this uh were there considerations for an
 
04:12:54.550 --> 04:12:54.560 align:start position:0%
example the state currently has a
 
04:12:54.560 --> 04:12:56.070 align:start position:0%
example the state currently has a
alcohol

04:12:56.070 --> 04:12:56.080 align:start position:0%
alcohol
 
04:12:58.790 --> 04:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
fund which a substantial amount of that
 
04:13:01.590 --> 04:13:01.600 align:start position:0%
goes towards the prevention of drug
 
04:13:08.950 --> 04:13:08.960 align:start position:0%
abuse and use and etc etc etc so um
 
04:13:11.309 --> 04:13:11.319 align:start position:0%
I just need to have a better
 
04:13:13.950 --> 04:13:13.960 align:start position:0%
understanding of this $25 million figure
 
04:13:16.710 --> 04:13:16.720 align:start position:0%
and I'm not U necessarily expecting you
 
04:13:20.269 --> 04:13:20.279 align:start position:0%
to give me an answer today but um I just
 
04:13:21.870 --> 04:13:21.880 align:start position:0%
just need to know where it came from did
 
04:13:23.550 --> 04:13:23.560 align:start position:0%
it was it suggested by
 
04:13:27.510 --> 04:13:27.520 align:start position:0%
HHS and then was it considered the other
 
04:13:29.149 --> 04:13:29.159 align:start position:0%
uh multitudes of monies they have for
 
04:13:31.189 --> 04:13:31.199 align:start position:0%
the same purpose because we are
 
04:13:33.429 --> 04:13:33.439 align:start position:0%
duplicating an effort and that sometimes
 
04:13:35.229 --> 04:13:35.239 align:start position:0%
concerns Us in
 
04:13:38.349 --> 04:13:38.359 align:start position:0%
finance thank you Mr if I may
 
04:13:40.750 --> 04:13:40.760 align:start position:0%
and what the way I Would S I would
 
04:13:43.229 --> 04:13:43.239 align:start position:0%
direct that and I'm not sure if there is
 
04:13:45.510 --> 04:13:45.520 align:start position:0%
a representative from DHHS
 
04:13:47.990 --> 04:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
here so I don't want to speak out of
 
04:13:50.189 --> 04:13:50.199 align:start position:0%
turn and explain that this this will
 
04:13:51.790 --> 04:13:51.800 align:start position:0%
cover all the problems or this is too
 
04:13:54.229 --> 04:13:54.239 align:start position:0%
much not enough but if you look at when
 
04:13:55.710 --> 04:13:55.720 align:start position:0%
you're talking about the the related
 
04:13:57.389 --> 04:13:57.399 align:start position:0%
education prevention treat I can't hear
 
04:13:58.830 --> 04:13:58.840 align:start position:0%
you I'm sorry when it comes to the
 
04:14:02.030 --> 04:14:02.040 align:start position:0%
education the uh mental health
 
04:14:06.030 --> 04:14:06.040 align:start position:0%
treatment uh the uh Publications I mean
 
04:14:08.269 --> 04:14:08.279 align:start position:0%
it mentions safety risk involving
 
04:14:11.189 --> 04:14:11.199 align:start position:0%
alcohol and tobacco we're talking far
 
04:14:15.469 --> 04:14:15.479 align:start position:0%
beyond just cannabis and one of the
 
04:14:17.389 --> 04:14:17.399 align:start position:0%
reasons that inspired me to even get
 
04:14:19.870 --> 04:14:19.880 align:start position:0%
involved as a state representative was
 
04:14:24.389 --> 04:14:24.399 align:start position:0%
the opioid issue you know I and for me I
 
04:14:26.790 --> 04:14:26.800 align:start position:0%
rather be in a situation that we're
 
04:14:29.189 --> 04:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
doing everything we can and I just I
 
04:14:30.469 --> 04:14:30.479 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that it's adequately
 
04:14:33.590 --> 04:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
funded because for the resources to be
 
04:14:36.070 --> 04:14:36.080 align:start position:0%
available because you have when people
 
04:14:38.349 --> 04:14:38.359 align:start position:0%
are have substance abuse issues there's
 
04:14:39.870 --> 04:14:39.880 align:start position:0%
a lot of collateral that goes along with
 
04:14:40.950 --> 04:14:40.960 align:start position:0%
that for example a lot of your breaking
 
04:14:42.830 --> 04:14:42.840 align:start position:0%
enterings your robber those are all
 
04:14:44.469 --> 04:14:44.479 align:start position:0%
related to substance abuse as well not
 
04:14:45.910 --> 04:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
all of them but there's a portion of
 
04:14:48.750 --> 04:14:48.760 align:start position:0%
crimes than thank you I me I I I don't
 
04:14:52.550 --> 04:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
disagree with any any of that but um
 
04:14:55.349 --> 04:14:55.359 align:start position:0%
typically what we would be looking for
 
04:14:56.870 --> 04:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
again this is a substantial amount of
 
04:14:59.990 --> 04:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
money um how these monies might be
 
04:15:03.030 --> 04:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
allocated how they might be spent and
 
04:15:04.670 --> 04:15:04.680 align:start position:0%
why is it necessary to have that amount
 
04:15:07.109 --> 04:15:07.119 align:start position:0%
of money I mean again this is this is
 
04:15:10.469 --> 04:15:10.479 align:start position:0%
asking for a large appropriation and
 
04:15:12.550 --> 04:15:12.560 align:start position:0%
these are the kind of things that we
 
04:15:15.349 --> 04:15:15.359 align:start position:0%
typically have to have uh before they
 
04:15:17.950 --> 04:15:17.960 align:start position:0%
get a positive vote for that
 
04:15:21.550 --> 04:15:21.560 align:start position:0%
appropriation and I would think again
 
04:15:23.149 --> 04:15:23.159 align:start position:0%
considering the amount of
 
04:15:25.790 --> 04:15:25.800 align:start position:0%
money aside from the subject matter
 
04:15:28.910 --> 04:15:28.920 align:start position:0%
there there should be some sort of idea
 
04:15:31.389 --> 04:15:31.399 align:start position:0%
of how what and where this money's to be
 
04:15:35.030 --> 04:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
spent and if that could be provided um
 
04:15:36.710 --> 04:15:36.720 align:start position:0%
that would be a great thing and it must
 
04:15:38.830 --> 04:15:38.840 align:start position:0%
exist somewhere because it's on paper
 
04:15:40.750 --> 04:15:40.760 align:start position:0%
and I'll tell you I'll tell you this
 
04:15:42.269 --> 04:15:42.279 align:start position:0%
that is the responsible thing for the
 
04:15:44.630 --> 04:15:44.640 align:start position:0%
legislator to do and if you're going to
 
04:15:46.630 --> 04:15:46.640 align:start position:0%
improve the F especially from a finance
 
04:15:48.670 --> 04:15:48.680 align:start position:0%
perspective talking to the mic if you're
 
04:15:50.870 --> 04:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
going to look at this on the financial
 
04:15:55.149 --> 04:15:55.159 align:start position:0%
side I I will say that if if an inquiry
 
04:15:57.990 --> 04:15:58.000 align:start position:0%
is made at DHHS as whether this is a
 
04:15:59.950 --> 04:15:59.960 align:start position:0%
sufficient funding and how would it be
 
04:16:01.790 --> 04:16:01.800 align:start position:0%
used and if they're unable to justify
 
04:16:03.790 --> 04:16:03.800 align:start position:0%
the expenditure I would I would support
 
04:16:06.229 --> 04:16:06.239 align:start position:0%
reducing that I think it it's something
 
04:16:09.389 --> 04:16:09.399 align:start position:0%
that it should be easily presented why
 
04:16:12.830 --> 04:16:12.840 align:start position:0%
this figure is supported not there was a
 
04:16:15.149 --> 04:16:15.159 align:start position:0%
lot of behind the scenes that this want
 
04:16:16.710 --> 04:16:16.720 align:start position:0%
this number doubled and I I was not
 
04:16:18.469 --> 04:16:18.479 align:start position:0%
supportive of that because again I
 
04:16:19.830 --> 04:16:19.840 align:start position:0%
didn't see any information to make it
 
04:16:19.840 --> 04:16:21.630 align:start position:0%
didn't see any information to make it
any

04:16:21.630 --> 04:16:21.640 align:start position:0%
any
 
04:16:25.389 --> 04:16:25.399 align:start position:0%
higher so so if I may if if um if I may
 
04:16:28.309 --> 04:16:28.319 align:start position:0%
Mr chair what what I think I would need
 
04:16:31.750 --> 04:16:31.760 align:start position:0%
here is somebody to come in front of
 
04:16:34.670 --> 04:16:34.680 align:start position:0%
this committee with some sort of
 
04:16:37.309 --> 04:16:37.319 align:start position:0%
accounting of where what and why this
 
04:16:40.070 --> 04:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
money is being spent and whomever you go
 
04:16:41.710 --> 04:16:41.720 align:start position:0%
to and I suspect it to be somebody at
 
04:16:46.269 --> 04:16:46.279 align:start position:0%
HHS to do that and um ask why this is
 
04:16:47.990 --> 04:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
necessary and again I'm not saying it
 
04:16:50.510 --> 04:16:50.520 align:start position:0%
isn't but why this is necessary in
 
04:16:53.429 --> 04:16:53.439 align:start position:0%
addition to what we already appropriate
 
04:16:56.550 --> 04:16:56.560 align:start position:0%
for this same purpose those are very
 
04:16:58.429 --> 04:16:58.439 align:start position:0%
important questions I believe that need
 
04:17:00.750 --> 04:17:00.760 align:start position:0%
to be answered before I could consider
 
04:17:03.149 --> 04:17:03.159 align:start position:0%
this thank you Mr chair thank you
 
04:17:05.109 --> 04:17:05.119 align:start position:0%
representative hat next is
 
04:17:08.870 --> 04:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:10.189 --> 04:17:10.199 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
04:17:12.550 --> 04:17:12.560 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh my my question is
 
04:17:16.389 --> 04:17:16.399 align:start position:0%
really about the the pricing and is
 
04:17:19.070 --> 04:17:19.080 align:start position:0%
there a potential for a pricing
 
04:17:21.189 --> 04:17:21.199 align:start position:0%
competition with the medical cannabis
 
04:17:25.109 --> 04:17:25.119 align:start position:0%
program and my concern would be if there
 
04:17:28.229 --> 04:17:28.239 align:start position:0%
is um the medical cannabis program is
 
04:17:30.030 --> 04:17:30.040 align:start position:0%
obviously they have other issues with
 
04:17:33.550 --> 04:17:33.560 align:start position:0%
education and um and treatment in
 
04:17:35.590 --> 04:17:35.600 align:start position:0%
counseling would this in any way
 
04:17:37.070 --> 04:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
undercut the pricing for medical
 
04:17:38.710 --> 04:17:38.720 align:start position:0%
cannabis program and how do you protect
 
04:17:43.670 --> 04:17:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:45.910 --> 04:17:45.920 align:start position:0%
pricing thank you for the question I
 
04:17:49.030 --> 04:17:49.040 align:start position:0%
would the price point at the retail
 
04:17:50.630 --> 04:17:50.640 align:start position:0%
would be controlled ultimately decided
 
04:17:52.189 --> 04:17:52.199 align:start position:0%
by the LI by liquor The Liquor
 
04:17:55.670 --> 04:17:55.680 align:start position:0%
Commission so how that would impact the
 
04:17:55.680 --> 04:17:56.950 align:start position:0%
Commission so how that would impact the
medical

04:17:56.950 --> 04:17:56.960 align:start position:0%
medical
 
04:17:59.590 --> 04:17:59.600 align:start position:0%
industry my observation is if someone is
 
04:18:02.030 --> 04:18:02.040 align:start position:0%
using cannabis for for legitimate
 
04:18:04.109 --> 04:18:04.119 align:start position:0%
medical reasons I don't see any reason
 
04:18:06.990 --> 04:18:07.000 align:start position:0%
why they wouldn't continue to purch
 
04:18:10.109 --> 04:18:10.119 align:start position:0%
cannabis from the medical facility the
 
04:18:12.030 --> 04:18:12.040 align:start position:0%
the people working in those facilities
 
04:18:14.870 --> 04:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
have a a knowledge or an expertise on
 
04:18:16.070 --> 04:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
the medical
 
04:18:19.269 --> 04:18:19.279 align:start position:0%
side at at when it's purely for retail
 
04:18:21.229 --> 04:18:21.239 align:start position:0%
or recreational purposes you don't
 
04:18:23.950 --> 04:18:23.960 align:start position:0%
necessarily need that same knowledge so
 
04:18:25.710 --> 04:18:25.720 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't I don't understand why
 
04:18:28.469 --> 04:18:28.479 align:start position:0%
someone would all of a sudden stop going
 
04:18:30.590 --> 04:18:30.600 align:start position:0%
there if especially if the product's
 
04:18:33.189 --> 04:18:33.199 align:start position:0%
being sold aren't identical but the
 
04:18:35.070 --> 04:18:35.080 align:start position:0%
other side of the medical industry the
 
04:18:37.070 --> 04:18:37.080 align:start position:0%
way to perhaps Preserve the medical
 
04:18:39.389 --> 04:18:39.399 align:start position:0%
industry to the extent that uh we're
 
04:18:41.070 --> 04:18:41.080 align:start position:0%
concerned this would have a negative
 
04:18:44.309 --> 04:18:44.319 align:start position:0%
impact on it is the the concept of
 
04:18:47.229 --> 04:18:47.239 align:start position:0%
allowing the medical industry to they
 
04:18:49.590 --> 04:18:49.600 align:start position:0%
already have a cultivation facility
 
04:18:53.070 --> 04:18:53.080 align:start position:0%
they're already growing plants perhaps
 
04:18:54.510 --> 04:18:54.520 align:start position:0%
those can be integrated at some point
 
04:18:56.309 --> 04:18:56.319 align:start position:0%
that's not in this bill but I would I
 
04:18:57.790 --> 04:18:57.800 align:start position:0%
wouldn't object to that
 
04:19:01.550 --> 04:19:01.560 align:start position:0%
policy just to follow um follow your
 
04:19:03.510 --> 04:19:03.520 align:start position:0%
question was why would anybody do it I I
 
04:19:05.830 --> 04:19:05.840 align:start position:0%
guess my answer would be if it costs
 
04:19:09.269 --> 04:19:09.279 align:start position:0%
less and you are in a treatment program
 
04:19:10.910 --> 04:19:10.920 align:start position:0%
where they are getting the counseling
 
04:19:12.590 --> 04:19:12.600 align:start position:0%
and they have overheads that are costly
 
04:19:14.710 --> 04:19:14.720 align:start position:0%
they're more costly than a retail or
 
04:19:18.990 --> 04:19:19.000 align:start position:0%
recreational Cannabis um uh product the
 
04:19:20.910 --> 04:19:20.920 align:start position:0%
answer to me to that question to me
 
04:19:22.109 --> 04:19:22.119 align:start position:0%
would be if it's cheaper they're going
 
04:19:24.630 --> 04:19:24.640 align:start position:0%
to go there for that so that's my
 
04:19:26.469 --> 04:19:26.479 align:start position:0%
question is how do we Safeguard and
 
04:19:28.510 --> 04:19:28.520 align:start position:0%
protect the medical cannabis program and
 
04:19:30.269 --> 04:19:30.279 align:start position:0%
the counseling they give to people to
 
04:19:32.149 --> 04:19:32.159 align:start position:0%
make sure that the price point is not
 
04:19:35.109 --> 04:19:35.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:37.750 --> 04:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
competition what I'll say it again if
 
04:19:40.469 --> 04:19:40.479 align:start position:0%
someone is using cannabis for legitimate
 
04:19:42.070 --> 04:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
medical reasons I don't understand why
 
04:19:44.389 --> 04:19:44.399 align:start position:0%
they're going to a retail store yes it's
 
04:19:47.389 --> 04:19:47.399 align:start position:0%
cannabis is cannabis but some of the
 
04:19:49.670 --> 04:19:49.680 align:start position:0%
medical products that they use are
 
04:19:52.710 --> 04:19:52.720 align:start position:0%
specific for a medical condition where
 
04:19:56.469 --> 04:19:56.479 align:start position:0%
Recreation is not quite as uh specific
 
04:19:58.870 --> 04:19:58.880 align:start position:0%
to that point if someone if if people
 
04:20:00.790 --> 04:20:00.800 align:start position:0%
just are if the medical industry people
 
04:20:02.429 --> 04:20:02.439 align:start position:0%
just getting the medical card simply to
 
04:20:04.750 --> 04:20:04.760 align:start position:0%
buy it for recreational purposes you can
 
04:20:07.109 --> 04:20:07.119 align:start position:0%
make an argument that they're Abus the
 
04:20:09.750 --> 04:20:09.760 align:start position:0%
the medication that being prescribed I I
 
04:20:11.950 --> 04:20:11.960 align:start position:0%
don't have I I have not heard of any
 
04:20:13.630 --> 04:20:13.640 align:start position:0%
reason to believe that that's happened I
 
04:20:16.269 --> 04:20:16.279 align:start position:0%
I have no basis to say that one way or
 
04:20:19.750 --> 04:20:19.760 align:start position:0%
another so I would presume they someone
 
04:20:21.109 --> 04:20:21.119 align:start position:0%
who's working with a counselor or
 
04:20:23.510 --> 04:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
psychologist or doctor would continue to
 
04:20:25.269 --> 04:20:25.279 align:start position:0%
do so because it's for legitimate
 
04:20:25.279 --> 04:20:27.070 align:start position:0%
do so because it's for legitimate
medical

04:20:27.070 --> 04:20:27.080 align:start position:0%
medical
 
04:20:28.870 --> 04:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
reasons thank
 
04:20:31.950 --> 04:20:31.960 align:start position:0%
you represent Li thank you I'm just
 
04:20:33.510 --> 04:20:33.520 align:start position:0%
going to sorry I'm going to dump back to
 
04:20:35.389 --> 04:20:35.399 align:start position:0%
the last questions we were asking
 
04:20:36.990 --> 04:20:37.000 align:start position:0%
talking about the 25 million million
 
04:20:39.910 --> 04:20:39.920 align:start position:0%
doll um would you be amendable I I I'm a
 
04:20:40.990 --> 04:20:41.000 align:start position:0%
little concerned about that number
 
04:20:43.590 --> 04:20:43.600 align:start position:0%
especially as a startup number and as a
 
04:20:45.070 --> 04:20:45.080 align:start position:0%
percentage of Revenue would that be a
 
04:20:46.910 --> 04:20:46.920 align:start position:0%
better way of going that with a Max cap
 
04:20:48.990 --> 04:20:49.000 align:start position:0%
of 25 million is that would that be
 
04:20:50.830 --> 04:20:50.840 align:start position:0%
something you would entertain if we did
 
04:20:52.910 --> 04:20:52.920 align:start position:0%
it as a percentage of the revenue with a
 
04:20:55.670 --> 04:20:55.680 align:start position:0%
maximum cap of 25 million do you think
 
04:20:58.309 --> 04:20:58.319 align:start position:0%
that is that a reasonable as the program
 
04:21:00.550 --> 04:21:00.560 align:start position:0%
grows the money to DHHS grows until it
 
04:21:04.070 --> 04:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:07.710 --> 04:21:07.720 align:start position:0%
cap I don't I don't have a
 
04:21:11.349 --> 04:21:11.359 align:start position:0%
that's not a deal breaker for me however
 
04:21:13.510 --> 04:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
I guess if we weigh the concerns we have
 
04:21:16.630 --> 04:21:16.640 align:start position:0%
of some of the issues with a rolling out
 
04:21:19.469 --> 04:21:19.479 align:start position:0%
a recreational policy I still think the
 
04:21:21.189 --> 04:21:21.199 align:start position:0%
high the biggest concern I hear is is
 
04:21:22.510 --> 04:21:22.520 align:start position:0%
still substance abuse I know not
 
04:21:25.630 --> 04:21:25.640 align:start position:0%
everyone agrees that it's a gateway drug
 
04:21:27.269 --> 04:21:27.279 align:start position:0%
I mean I'm not saying one way or another
 
04:21:28.830 --> 04:21:28.840 align:start position:0%
but there the concerns of the the
 
04:21:31.309 --> 04:21:31.319 align:start position:0%
collective population that's what I
 
04:21:33.950 --> 04:21:33.960 align:start position:0%
often hear so for me I would I would
 
04:21:35.950 --> 04:21:35.960 align:start position:0%
hope that at a minimum we we at least
 
04:21:38.030 --> 04:21:38.040 align:start position:0%
address do everything we can to mitigate
 
04:21:39.670 --> 04:21:39.680 align:start position:0%
the negative potential negative social
 
04:21:42.149 --> 04:21:42.159 align:start position:0%
impact so I I have some concerns about
 
04:21:44.510 --> 04:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
not by changing that so they don't they
 
04:21:47.070 --> 04:21:47.080 align:start position:0%
don't get the net amount but at the same
 
04:21:49.070 --> 04:21:49.080 align:start position:0%
time that's not a deal breaker for me
 
04:21:49.870 --> 04:21:49.880 align:start position:0%
because they're still going to be
 
04:21:51.990 --> 04:21:52.000 align:start position:0%
getting significant funding in addition
 
04:21:53.670 --> 04:21:53.680 align:start position:0%
to what they're already getting thank
 
04:21:55.469 --> 04:21:55.479 align:start position:0%
you and Mr chair just to let you know I
 
04:21:58.070 --> 04:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
did reach out to DHHS and ask them for
 
04:22:00.070 --> 04:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
their funding on cessation programs
 
04:22:01.269 --> 04:22:01.279 align:start position:0%
because you as you know we have alcohol
 
04:22:02.870 --> 04:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
cessation programs we have gambling
 
04:22:05.269 --> 04:22:05.279 align:start position:0%
addiction cessation programs and I asked
 
04:22:07.189 --> 04:22:07.199 align:start position:0%
them for the funding of any those cation
 
04:22:09.269 --> 04:22:09.279 align:start position:0%
programs what the source of those
 
04:22:11.389 --> 04:22:11.399 align:start position:0%
revenues are how much money they collect
 
04:22:13.070 --> 04:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
and how much money they expend and how
 
04:22:14.710 --> 04:22:14.720 align:start position:0%
many citizens are helped by those
 
04:22:16.109 --> 04:22:16.119 align:start position:0%
programs and I'll be happy to share that
 
04:22:18.790 --> 04:22:18.800 align:start position:0%
with the committee when I get it thank
 
04:22:20.950 --> 04:22:20.960 align:start position:0%
you uh representative spillsbury
 
04:22:23.109 --> 04:22:23.119 align:start position:0%
followed by representative
 
04:22:25.870 --> 04:22:25.880 align:start position:0%
Brony thank you Mr chairman I have three
 
04:22:27.389 --> 04:22:27.399 align:start position:0%
questions if I can keep them brief
 
04:22:29.030 --> 04:22:29.040 align:start position:0%
perhaps I'll get to all
 
04:22:32.389 --> 04:22:32.399 align:start position:0%
three uh thank you representative abis
 
04:22:33.910 --> 04:22:33.920 align:start position:0%
you're being called upon to cover a
 
04:22:37.109 --> 04:22:37.119 align:start position:0%
pretty broad Arena of questions it's no
 
04:22:38.469 --> 04:22:38.479 align:start position:0%
problem you know in criminal justice I
 
04:22:41.229 --> 04:22:41.239 align:start position:0%
didn't get asked one question my my
 
04:22:42.910 --> 04:22:42.920 align:start position:0%
first question is I just want to be sure
 
04:22:45.349 --> 04:22:45.359 align:start position:0%
that I understand correctly the bill
 
04:22:49.189 --> 04:22:49.199 align:start position:0%
only calls for the legislature to make a
 
04:22:52.469 --> 04:22:52.479 align:start position:0%
single upfront uh appropriation from
 
04:22:55.630 --> 04:22:55.640 align:start position:0%
General funds of $14 million essentially
 
04:22:56.990 --> 04:22:57.000 align:start position:0%
a startup
 
04:22:59.710 --> 04:22:59.720 align:start position:0%
capital and that would be repaid and
 
04:23:04.710 --> 04:23:04.720 align:start position:0%
then all other uh expenses and uh
 
04:23:08.070 --> 04:23:08.080 align:start position:0%
distribution of profits are
 
04:23:10.070 --> 04:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
self-generating that's that's the that's
 
04:23:11.349 --> 04:23:11.359 align:start position:0%
how how it's written and that's
 
04:23:12.990 --> 04:23:13.000 align:start position:0%
certainly was my
 
04:23:16.990 --> 04:23:17.000 align:start position:0%
intent when I help put this together so
 
04:23:18.750 --> 04:23:18.760 align:start position:0%
the initial capital investment we need
 
04:23:22.670 --> 04:23:22.680 align:start position:0%
to consider is the 14 million my second
 
04:23:27.030 --> 04:23:27.040 align:start position:0%
question um switching uh
 
04:23:30.309 --> 04:23:30.319 align:start position:0%
considerably I like very much uh the
 
04:23:31.349 --> 04:23:31.359 align:start position:0%
idea of
 
04:23:35.510 --> 04:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
90% of the profits after the initial
 
04:23:38.630 --> 04:23:38.640 align:start position:0%
costs rep payment and 25 million for
 
04:23:41.389 --> 04:23:41.399 align:start position:0%
treatment of going to education and I
 
04:23:43.710 --> 04:23:43.720 align:start position:0%
suspect that that could be a
 
04:23:47.070 --> 04:23:47.080 align:start position:0%
motivator uh for many legislators my
 
04:23:49.950 --> 04:23:49.960 align:start position:0%
question is if I'm understanding it
 
04:23:53.630 --> 04:23:53.640 align:start position:0%
correctly this specifically States 90%
 
04:23:55.870 --> 04:23:55.880 align:start position:0%
to offset the education tax imposed on
 
04:23:57.630 --> 04:23:57.640 align:start position:0%
all persons and property taxable
 
04:24:01.070 --> 04:24:01.080 align:start position:0%
pursuant to RSA 76 d8 without looking it
 
04:24:02.590 --> 04:24:02.600 align:start position:0%
up I believe we're talking about the
 
04:24:05.149 --> 04:24:05.159 align:start position:0%
swept the Statewide education property
 
04:24:08.790 --> 04:24:08.800 align:start position:0%
tax that's correct and uh that's a
 
04:24:08.800 --> 04:24:10.389 align:start position:0%
tax that's correct and uh that's a
considerable

04:24:10.389 --> 04:24:10.399 align:start position:0%
considerable
 
04:24:14.630 --> 04:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
figure um but instead of then
 
04:24:17.469 --> 04:24:17.479 align:start position:0%
redistributing as is proposed on page
 
04:24:20.229 --> 04:24:20.239 align:start position:0%
nine lines 3 through
 
04:24:24.510 --> 04:24:24.520 align:start position:0%
14 why would we not just if we were so
 
04:24:27.790 --> 04:24:27.800 align:start position:0%
fortunate as to have covered all of the
 
04:24:30.429 --> 04:24:30.439 align:start position:0%
swept why would we not just continue to
 
04:24:32.990 --> 04:24:33.000 align:start position:0%
put 90% into the education trust fund
 
04:24:35.149 --> 04:24:35.159 align:start position:0%
and stick with that particular
 
04:24:35.159 --> 04:24:39.349 align:start position:0%
and stick with that particular
purpose

04:24:39.349 --> 04:24:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:40.710 --> 04:24:40.720 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying that I would be opposed
 
04:24:44.389 --> 04:24:44.399 align:start position:0%
to such a such a policy my concern was
 
04:24:48.429 --> 04:24:48.439 align:start position:0%
is that if you if you offset the the
 
04:24:52.149 --> 04:24:52.159 align:start position:0%
sweat my concern was that in the next
 
04:24:54.469 --> 04:24:54.479 align:start position:0%
budget they may increase that number but
 
04:24:56.550 --> 04:24:56.560 align:start position:0%
without having a steady line of
 
04:24:58.830 --> 04:24:58.840 align:start position:0%
consistent Revenue you want to make sure
 
04:25:00.510 --> 04:25:00.520 align:start position:0%
you don't want to then raise that the
 
04:25:01.910 --> 04:25:01.920 align:start position:0%
amount that you make I get the feeling
 
04:25:03.109 --> 04:25:03.119 align:start position:0%
that the legislator would consider
 
04:25:05.189 --> 04:25:05.199 align:start position:0%
raising the swep thinking it wouldn't
 
04:25:06.870 --> 04:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
have any impact on the
 
04:25:09.469 --> 04:25:09.479 align:start position:0%
taxpayer well it and all of a sudden if
 
04:25:11.149 --> 04:25:11.159 align:start position:0%
you fall short maybe there'll be a big
 
04:25:13.590 --> 04:25:13.600 align:start position:0%
russan sales and maybe may drop down it
 
04:25:15.950 --> 04:25:15.960 align:start position:0%
can we're dealing with somewhat UNP
 
04:25:18.109 --> 04:25:18.119 align:start position:0%
unpredictability I would hate to see the
 
04:25:21.429 --> 04:25:21.439 align:start position:0%
taxes be raised and then that that's not
 
04:25:23.309 --> 04:25:23.319 align:start position:0%
property tax release could be so
 
04:25:27.389 --> 04:25:27.399 align:start position:0%
fortunate to generate 263 or 363 million
 
04:25:29.149 --> 04:25:29.159 align:start position:0%
there are different mechanisms for
 
04:25:30.790 --> 04:25:30.800 align:start position:0%
continuing to steer the money into
 
04:25:34.149 --> 04:25:34.159 align:start position:0%
education and my third question again
 
04:25:37.109 --> 04:25:37.119 align:start position:0%
switching dramatically uh the banking
 
04:25:39.590 --> 04:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
services I think that there may be uh a
 
04:25:41.469 --> 04:25:41.479 align:start position:0%
number of people who will testify that
 
04:25:43.510 --> 04:25:43.520 align:start position:0%
there's problems with setting up this
 
04:25:47.990 --> 04:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
banking mechanism as a statun uh uh and
 
04:25:49.750 --> 04:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
and I I don't
 
04:25:52.790 --> 04:25:52.800 align:start position:0%
know what the FI financing challenges
 
04:25:55.030 --> 04:25:55.040 align:start position:0%
would be to startups who don't have
 
04:25:58.030 --> 04:25:58.040 align:start position:0%
access to such a fund but if if we came
 
04:26:00.389 --> 04:26:00.399 align:start position:0%
to the conclusion that we didn't want
 
04:26:03.189 --> 04:26:03.199 align:start position:0%
the state in that particular function
 
04:26:06.750 --> 04:26:06.760 align:start position:0%
and took out 318 F16 do you think that
 
04:26:11.109 --> 04:26:11.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:14.149 --> 04:26:14.159 align:start position:0%
bill well I'm only one vote it wouldn't
 
04:26:18.990 --> 04:26:19.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:22.429 --> 04:26:22.439 align:start position:0%
this if the this gives the private
 
04:26:25.030 --> 04:26:25.040 align:start position:0%
sector every option to handle the
 
04:26:27.750 --> 04:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
banking side of this every option is
 
04:26:29.670 --> 04:26:29.680 align:start position:0%
available to to them to demonstrate to
 
04:26:31.590 --> 04:26:31.600 align:start position:0%
The Liquor Commission that they can
 
04:26:34.229 --> 04:26:34.239 align:start position:0%
satisfy the the needs so that a private
 
04:26:36.309 --> 04:26:36.319 align:start position:0%
institution can handle the banking side
 
04:26:39.389 --> 04:26:39.399 align:start position:0%
of this if a private institution is
 
04:26:41.950 --> 04:26:41.960 align:start position:0%
unable to make that demonstration to The
 
04:26:44.189 --> 04:26:44.199 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission I don't understand why
 
04:26:46.429 --> 04:26:46.439 align:start position:0%
we don't want to have a a spare
 
04:26:49.189 --> 04:26:49.199 align:start position:0%
tire and have a backup plan because then
 
04:26:51.910 --> 04:26:51.920 align:start position:0%
what we're going to have is we're going
 
04:26:53.990 --> 04:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
to have a lot of cast sitting around
 
04:26:55.030 --> 04:26:55.040 align:start position:0%
we're not going to have a place to put
 
04:26:58.189 --> 04:26:58.199 align:start position:0%
it that is the ultimate Plan B and I
 
04:27:01.550 --> 04:27:01.560 align:start position:0%
hope that plan a works so taking that
 
04:27:05.590 --> 04:27:05.600 align:start position:0%
out I understand some some uh some
 
04:27:06.950 --> 04:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
people the banking industry don't like
 
04:27:09.469 --> 04:27:09.479 align:start position:0%
to see the language at all but if their
 
04:27:11.389 --> 04:27:11.399 align:start position:0%
if their clients or if their if that
 
04:27:13.950 --> 04:27:13.960 align:start position:0%
institution is so willing to take on the
 
04:27:17.590 --> 04:27:17.600 align:start position:0%
states need Plan B won't be an issue but
 
04:27:20.269 --> 04:27:20.279 align:start position:0%
I'm surprised people want to take it out
 
04:27:21.990 --> 04:27:22.000 align:start position:0%
if if they're able to satisfy plan a
 
04:27:23.830 --> 04:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
plan B is never going to come up so I'm
 
04:27:27.510 --> 04:27:27.520 align:start position:0%
just curious why it's such a problem so
 
04:27:30.469 --> 04:27:30.479 align:start position:0%
I may be U missing some of the intent
 
04:27:30.479 --> 04:27:31.750 align:start position:0%
I may be U missing some of the intent
here

04:27:31.750 --> 04:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:27:34.790 --> 04:27:34.800 align:start position:0%
but where are the funds coming from that
 
04:27:38.309 --> 04:27:38.319 align:start position:0%
would capitalize this state banking
 
04:27:41.590 --> 04:27:41.600 align:start position:0%
facility and aren't they competing with
 
04:27:43.510 --> 04:27:43.520 align:start position:0%
the funds that we're thinking maybe are
 
04:27:45.349 --> 04:27:45.359 align:start position:0%
going to be steered
 
04:27:49.630 --> 04:27:49.640 align:start position:0%
towards um treatment abuse abuse
 
04:27:51.550 --> 04:27:51.560 align:start position:0%
treatment and
 
04:27:54.429 --> 04:27:54.439 align:start position:0%
education so the the $14 million
 
04:27:55.750 --> 04:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
appropriation does not take into
 
04:27:58.550 --> 04:27:58.560 align:start position:0%
consideration the possibility of having
 
04:28:01.830 --> 04:28:01.840 align:start position:0%
the state Chartered Bank we wouldn't
 
04:28:03.990 --> 04:28:04.000 align:start position:0%
just the way the bill is written that
 
04:28:06.349 --> 04:28:06.359 align:start position:0%
that issue wouldn't be realized until
 
04:28:08.269 --> 04:28:08.279 align:start position:0%
approximately six seven months after
 
04:28:10.630 --> 04:28:10.640 align:start position:0%
this be would become law which we're a
 
04:28:13.269 --> 04:28:13.279 align:start position:0%
few months away so in all likelihood
 
04:28:14.990 --> 04:28:15.000 align:start position:0%
from the way I see see this is that
 
04:28:17.269 --> 04:28:17.279 align:start position:0%
we'll probably be in the year
 
04:28:21.030 --> 04:28:21.040 align:start position:0%
2023 so that 10 Mill that $10 million
 
04:28:23.990 --> 04:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
may have would have to come from the
 
04:28:24.000 --> 04:28:26.070 align:start position:0%
may have would have to come from the
following

04:28:26.070 --> 04:28:26.080 align:start position:0%
following
 
04:28:28.189 --> 04:28:28.199 align:start position:0%
budget but
 
04:28:30.429 --> 04:28:30.439 align:start position:0%
again if if we're going to roll this
 
04:28:32.590 --> 04:28:32.600 align:start position:0%
plan out without a financial institution
 
04:28:35.510 --> 04:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
to put money into that's a huge problem
 
04:28:37.229 --> 04:28:37.239 align:start position:0%
and by having a financial institution
 
04:28:39.030 --> 04:28:39.040 align:start position:0%
that would benefit the cultivators as
 
04:28:42.109 --> 04:28:42.119 align:start position:0%
well the uh manufacturers would benefit
 
04:28:43.590 --> 04:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
and then that would I know there Private
 
04:28:47.389 --> 04:28:47.399 align:start position:0%
Financial financing options but again
 
04:28:50.590 --> 04:28:50.600 align:start position:0%
that's that's private financing not
 
04:28:52.229 --> 04:28:52.239 align:start position:0%
everyone that's tough to come by if you
 
04:28:54.630 --> 04:28:54.640 align:start position:0%
were if the people can get financing for
 
04:28:56.510 --> 04:28:56.520 align:start position:0%
a business like
 
04:28:58.750 --> 04:28:58.760 align:start position:0%
cultivation uh that would be benefit to
 
04:28:59.990 --> 04:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
allow more people to actually get into
 
04:29:01.710 --> 04:29:01.720 align:start position:0%
the industry right now the majority of
 
04:29:04.510 --> 04:29:04.520 align:start position:0%
the cultivators they're using startup
 
04:29:07.550 --> 04:29:07.560 align:start position:0%
cash you know I he estimates $57 million
 
04:29:09.790 --> 04:29:09.800 align:start position:0%
in liquid cash is what it takes to get
 
04:29:12.070 --> 04:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
in so that's not really a you hear the
 
04:29:14.990 --> 04:29:15.000 align:start position:0%
term Equity thrown around I don't if you
 
04:29:18.030 --> 04:29:18.040 align:start position:0%
have 5 to7 million in and in liquid cash
 
04:29:18.040 --> 04:29:19.429 align:start position:0%
have 5 to7 million in and in liquid cash
sitting

04:29:19.429 --> 04:29:19.439 align:start position:0%
sitting
 
04:29:21.630 --> 04:29:21.640 align:start position:0%
around you know the equity issue is not
 
04:29:22.830 --> 04:29:22.840 align:start position:0%
really something that's affecting you
 
04:29:22.840 --> 04:29:25.870 align:start position:0%
really something that's affecting you
that

04:29:25.870 --> 04:29:25.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:25.880 --> 04:29:28.030 align:start position:0%
 
much

04:29:28.030 --> 04:29:28.040 align:start position:0%
much
 
04:29:30.910 --> 04:29:30.920 align:start position:0%
okay representative BR yeah thank you Mr
 
04:29:33.590 --> 04:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
chair um I got one followup to
 
04:29:35.469 --> 04:29:35.479 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy's comments and
 
04:29:37.590 --> 04:29:37.600 align:start position:0%
then one new issue that I'll bring
 
04:29:40.990 --> 04:29:41.000 align:start position:0%
up related to the atc's I have been
 
04:29:42.670 --> 04:29:42.680 align:start position:0%
getting calls from the atcs concerned
 
04:29:43.870 --> 04:29:43.880 align:start position:0%
about this
 
04:29:43.880 --> 04:29:45.590 align:start position:0%
about this
bill

04:29:45.590 --> 04:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:29:47.910 --> 04:29:47.920 align:start position:0%
uh there's seven of them in the state
 
04:29:50.550 --> 04:29:50.560 align:start position:0%
just FYI owned by three companies
 
04:29:52.990 --> 04:29:53.000 align:start position:0%
they're vertically integrated they do
 
04:29:56.269 --> 04:29:56.279 align:start position:0%
they grow they manufacture and they
 
04:30:00.229 --> 04:30:00.239 align:start position:0%
sell now when I look at page 12 of the
 
04:30:04.109 --> 04:30:04.119 align:start position:0%
bill it says on uh let's go lines four
 
04:30:08.309 --> 04:30:08.319 align:start position:0%
to six it says this has to do with uh
 
04:30:10.630 --> 04:30:10.640 align:start position:0%
the quality of the Cannabis such
 
04:30:13.189 --> 04:30:13.199 align:start position:0%
cannabis shall be free from adulteration
 
04:30:15.149 --> 04:30:15.159 align:start position:0%
and misb banding within the meaning of
 
04:30:18.149 --> 04:30:18.159 align:start position:0%
the provision of RSA 146 all cannabis
 
04:30:22.630 --> 04:30:22.640 align:start position:0%
sold for medicinal use shall conform to
 
04:30:25.109 --> 04:30:25.119 align:start position:0%
the standards and tests for such
 
04:30:27.189 --> 04:30:27.199 align:start position:0%
cannabis under New Hampshire law at the
 
04:30:30.910 --> 04:30:30.920 align:start position:0%
time of sale so the bill itself
 
04:30:34.149 --> 04:30:34.159 align:start position:0%
contemplates medical people with medical
 
04:30:36.750 --> 04:30:36.760 align:start position:0%
cards coming into to these State stores
 
04:30:38.550 --> 04:30:38.560 align:start position:0%
and buying
 
04:30:41.030 --> 04:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
cannabis that's the why I read this I
 
04:30:42.950 --> 04:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
mean this bill itself is saying that
 
04:30:45.670 --> 04:30:45.680 align:start position:0%
what represented Murphy was saying could
 
04:30:48.710 --> 04:30:48.720 align:start position:0%
happen the bill also anti anticipates
 
04:30:50.109 --> 04:30:50.119 align:start position:0%
that that occurring would would you
 
04:30:52.750 --> 04:30:52.760 align:start position:0%
agree with me or am I misreading that
 
04:30:54.910 --> 04:30:54.920 align:start position:0%
you're not misreading that the the use
 
04:30:56.670 --> 04:30:56.680 align:start position:0%
of Edibles that are sold in a retail
 
04:31:00.550 --> 04:31:00.560 align:start position:0%
store in order to buy it those you would
 
04:31:04.189 --> 04:31:04.199 align:start position:0%
still require a medical card even if
 
04:31:06.309 --> 04:31:06.319 align:start position:0%
you're buying it from the state on
 
04:31:09.349 --> 04:31:09.359 align:start position:0%
retailer so for that purpose there there
 
04:31:10.870 --> 04:31:10.880 align:start position:0%
could be some
 
04:31:13.910 --> 04:31:13.920 align:start position:0%
overlap my own personal opinion on that
 
04:31:15.990 --> 04:31:16.000 align:start position:0%
again if if you're going to allow a
 
04:31:16.000 --> 04:31:17.950 align:start position:0%
again if if you're going to allow a
recreational

04:31:17.950 --> 04:31:17.960 align:start position:0%
recreational
 
04:31:20.510 --> 04:31:20.520 align:start position:0%
product I'm I'm I'm a little that was a
 
04:31:22.269 --> 04:31:22.279 align:start position:0%
compromise that I made when we put this
 
04:31:25.389 --> 04:31:25.399 align:start position:0%
together uh I I would support the idea
 
04:31:26.950 --> 04:31:26.960 align:start position:0%
of removing that provision but from what
 
04:31:28.349 --> 04:31:28.359 align:start position:0%
I understand that that may be a deal
 
04:31:30.790 --> 04:31:30.800 align:start position:0%
breaker with a lot of individuals and
 
04:31:32.070 --> 04:31:32.080 align:start position:0%
that this might not make it over the
 
04:31:33.269 --> 04:31:33.279 align:start position:0%
finish line if you change it I'm just
 
04:31:35.870 --> 04:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
being honest again the way I read it
 
04:31:37.349 --> 04:31:37.359 align:start position:0%
represent follow that provision is a
 
04:31:38.870 --> 04:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
little awkward I will it doesn't talk
 
04:31:41.030 --> 04:31:41.040 align:start position:0%
about Edibles here it talks about all
 
04:31:44.550 --> 04:31:44.560 align:start position:0%
cannabis so I just wanted to to let you
 
04:31:47.710 --> 04:31:47.720 align:start position:0%
be aware of that so this my second
 
04:31:47.720 --> 04:31:49.269 align:start position:0%
be aware of that so this my second
question

04:31:49.269 --> 04:31:49.279 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:31:54.070 --> 04:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
is um has to do what the ordinance is so
 
04:31:57.590 --> 04:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
this bill I would call it an opt out
 
04:32:01.189 --> 04:32:01.199 align:start position:0%
ability for communities on page seven
 
04:32:04.229 --> 04:32:04.239 align:start position:0%
lines 7 through 15 uh for those who
 
04:32:07.830 --> 04:32:07.840 align:start position:0%
haven't read this yet um so is it safe
 
04:32:11.950 --> 04:32:11.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:16.269 --> 04:32:16.279 align:start position:0%
community that's correct right and to to
 
04:32:18.910 --> 04:32:18.920 align:start position:0%
my way of here's the reason I'm bringing
 
04:32:21.109 --> 04:32:21.119 align:start position:0%
it up in relation to
 
04:32:24.429 --> 04:32:24.439 align:start position:0%
revenues I think it'll be more difficult
 
04:32:26.630 --> 04:32:26.640 align:start position:0%
for the Liquor Commission to convince
 
04:32:28.309 --> 04:32:28.319 align:start position:0%
communities to sell
 
04:32:32.950 --> 04:32:32.960 align:start position:0%
cannabis than alcohol I think alcohol is
 
04:32:36.149 --> 04:32:36.159 align:start position:0%
more uh accepted still
 
04:32:39.030 --> 04:32:39.040 align:start position:0%
uh in the state than Matt cannabis so
 
04:32:42.269 --> 04:32:42.279 align:start position:0%
that I anticipate that there'll be more
 
04:32:44.269 --> 04:32:44.279 align:start position:0%
communities opting out assuming they
 
04:32:47.389 --> 04:32:47.399 align:start position:0%
know about this opt out provision uh in
 
04:32:49.070 --> 04:32:49.080 align:start position:0%
the ordinances
 
04:32:51.670 --> 04:32:51.680 align:start position:0%
so and the reason I mentioned that is
 
04:32:53.670 --> 04:32:53.680 align:start position:0%
that it's it's going to be more
 
04:32:55.389 --> 04:32:55.399 align:start position:0%
difficult if it's more difficult to
 
04:32:58.109 --> 04:32:58.119 align:start position:0%
locate store locations in Prime
 
04:33:00.149 --> 04:33:00.159 align:start position:0%
locations uh that will affect the
 
04:33:03.229 --> 04:33:03.239 align:start position:0%
revenues indirectly or directly actually
 
04:33:04.470 --> 04:33:04.480 align:start position:0%
would you would you agree with that or
 
04:33:04.480 --> 04:33:06.470 align:start position:0%
would you would you agree with that or
not

04:33:06.470 --> 04:33:06.480 align:start position:0%
not
 
04:33:08.789 --> 04:33:08.799 align:start position:0%
if I would agree if they're limited on
 
04:33:11.470 --> 04:33:11.480 align:start position:0%
the locations or town if enough towns uh
 
04:33:11.480 --> 04:33:12.629 align:start position:0%
the locations or town if enough towns uh
opt

04:33:12.629 --> 04:33:12.639 align:start position:0%
opt
 
04:33:15.150 --> 04:33:15.160 align:start position:0%
out it's it could create a problem I
 
04:33:16.590 --> 04:33:16.600 align:start position:0%
think it would take a lot of towns or
 
04:33:18.990 --> 04:33:19.000 align:start position:0%
communities to opt out but the benefit
 
04:33:22.789 --> 04:33:22.799 align:start position:0%
of this plan was that you don't have 10
 
04:33:26.070 --> 04:33:26.080 align:start position:0%
12 retail stores in in your community I
 
04:33:28.830 --> 04:33:28.840 align:start position:0%
where I hail from is Salem if there's 10
 
04:33:31.150 --> 04:33:31.160 align:start position:0%
stores in Salem and then you know Derry
 
04:33:33.189 --> 04:33:33.199 align:start position:0%
or Windam decides to opt out well
 
04:33:36.150 --> 04:33:36.160 align:start position:0%
there's 10 stores within
 
04:33:39.670 --> 04:33:39.680 align:start position:0%
you two two miles from you so some of
 
04:33:41.990 --> 04:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
the optup provisions I'm not sure that's
 
04:33:43.470 --> 04:33:43.480 align:start position:0%
going to be necessarily beneficial the
 
04:33:45.189 --> 04:33:45.199 align:start position:0%
idea of this I don't
 
04:33:47.910 --> 04:33:47.920 align:start position:0%
foresee uh The Liquor Commission opening
 
04:33:49.869 --> 04:33:49.879 align:start position:0%
that large volume of stores the idea is
 
04:33:51.150 --> 04:33:51.160 align:start position:0%
to have a limited amount of retail
 
04:33:53.230 --> 04:33:53.240 align:start position:0%
stores in the first place like similar
 
04:33:55.269 --> 04:33:55.279 align:start position:0%
to how liquor sold but can we follow up
 
04:33:58.189 --> 04:33:58.199 align:start position:0%
then so the bill talks about 10 stores
 
04:34:00.310 --> 04:34:00.320 align:start position:0%
right I'm not missing mistaken right it
 
04:34:03.029 --> 04:34:03.039 align:start position:0%
talks about a limit of 10 stores so for
 
04:34:05.349 --> 04:34:05.359 align:start position:0%
in the fiscal note it operates on the
 
04:34:06.869 --> 04:34:06.879 align:start position:0%
assumption that there'll be 10 retail
 
04:34:08.789 --> 04:34:08.799 align:start position:0%
stores there's actually no language in
 
04:34:12.189 --> 04:34:12.199 align:start position:0%
the bill to limit 10 retail stores the
 
04:34:13.990 --> 04:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
issue is is that in order to come up
 
04:34:15.789 --> 04:34:15.799 align:start position:0%
with from my understand come up with any
 
04:34:19.869 --> 04:34:19.879 align:start position:0%
type of fiscal note or estimation on
 
04:34:21.150 --> 04:34:21.160 align:start position:0%
what needs to be appropriated they need
 
04:34:23.990 --> 04:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
to have a a base to work with uh I
 
04:34:25.470 --> 04:34:25.480 align:start position:0%
didn't see the reason why we would maybe
 
04:34:28.189 --> 04:34:28.199 align:start position:0%
limit the amount of stores because this
 
04:34:30.789 --> 04:34:30.799 align:start position:0%
my own personal opinion if we have to
 
04:34:32.470 --> 04:34:32.480 align:start position:0%
pass legislation every time we want to
 
04:34:34.349 --> 04:34:34.359 align:start position:0%
open a store we I don't believe we
 
04:34:36.990 --> 04:34:37.000 align:start position:0%
really want to you're doing that it we
 
04:34:38.629 --> 04:34:38.639 align:start position:0%
have to take into consideration that if
 
04:34:41.990 --> 04:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
we have private cultivators and private
 
04:34:44.750 --> 04:34:44.760 align:start position:0%
manufacturers that you those business
 
04:34:47.230 --> 04:34:47.240 align:start position:0%
businesses need to also succeed and if
 
04:34:49.470 --> 04:34:49.480 align:start position:0%
the 10 stores isn't is not enough to
 
04:34:50.789 --> 04:34:50.799 align:start position:0%
meet the market
 
04:34:53.551 --> 04:34:53.561 align:start position:0%
demand there's no reason why we we
 
04:34:55.990 --> 04:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
shouldn't expand but I think that's that
 
04:34:58.029 --> 04:34:58.039 align:start position:0%
in my opinion that's a decent starting
 
04:34:59.590 --> 04:34:59.600 align:start position:0%
point and if you just kind of think in
 
04:35:03.150 --> 04:35:03.160 align:start position:0%
your head some of the major cities
 
04:35:06.310 --> 04:35:06.320 align:start position:0%
93 Salem I mean you you're at 78 just
 
04:35:08.551 --> 04:35:08.561 align:start position:0%
just thinking about that right now so
 
04:35:11.349 --> 04:35:11.359 align:start position:0%
then one more followup then then you're
 
04:35:13.230 --> 04:35:13.240 align:start position:0%
also saying that I misread the fact that
 
04:35:14.910 --> 04:35:14.920 align:start position:0%
there was only
 
04:35:17.709 --> 04:35:17.719 align:start position:0%
15 uh
 
04:35:19.789 --> 04:35:19.799 align:start position:0%
cultivators so there there would be
 
04:35:21.590 --> 04:35:21.600 align:start position:0%
that's for for licensing purposes they
 
04:35:23.709 --> 04:35:23.719 align:start position:0%
would limit it to 15 licenses that's in
 
04:35:25.629 --> 04:35:25.639 align:start position:0%
the license section that's that's for
 
04:35:27.709 --> 04:35:27.719 align:start position:0%
that's for cultivation
 
04:35:30.551 --> 04:35:30.561 align:start position:0%
specifically so how do so we're g to
 
04:35:32.830 --> 04:35:32.840 align:start position:0%
have 15 cultivators
 
04:35:35.269 --> 04:35:35.279 align:start position:0%
feeding first I thought it was 10 stores
 
04:35:37.470 --> 04:35:37.480 align:start position:0%
but it unlimited number of stores unless
 
04:35:39.029 --> 04:35:39.039 align:start position:0%
we change the language or change the
 
04:35:40.670 --> 04:35:40.680 align:start position:0%
bill down the road change the law down
 
04:35:44.949 --> 04:35:44.959 align:start position:0%
the road to create more cultivators to
 
04:35:47.830 --> 04:35:47.840 align:start position:0%
feed these
 
04:35:51.150 --> 04:35:51.160 align:start position:0%
stores well for someone I'm not into
 
04:35:54.349 --> 04:35:54.359 align:start position:0%
cultivation industry but if they when I
 
04:35:57.230 --> 04:35:57.240 align:start position:0%
understand that when plants are
 
04:35:59.310 --> 04:35:59.320 align:start position:0%
grown there's going to be a market order
 
04:36:00.429 --> 04:36:00.439 align:start position:0%
submitted to them this is what we're
 
04:36:02.470 --> 04:36:02.480 align:start position:0%
looking they then grow to try to fill
 
04:36:04.830 --> 04:36:04.840 align:start position:0%
that market order there's no reason why
 
04:36:06.990 --> 04:36:07.000 align:start position:0%
the facility itself can grow as does the
 
04:36:08.869 --> 04:36:08.879 align:start position:0%
market as does the demand for the
 
04:36:12.510 --> 04:36:12.520 align:start position:0%
product if if the 15 cultivators can't
 
04:36:14.390 --> 04:36:14.400 align:start position:0%
meet the retail
 
04:36:16.709 --> 04:36:16.719 align:start position:0%
demand I would hope the state would have
 
04:36:21.390 --> 04:36:21.400 align:start position:0%
the uh wisdom to expand that number okay
 
04:36:23.029 --> 04:36:23.039 align:start position:0%
thank you that this this been actually
 
04:36:25.429 --> 04:36:25.439 align:start position:0%
helpful to understand thank
 
04:36:29.109 --> 04:36:29.119 align:start position:0%
you representative Petri yeah thank you
 
04:36:30.830 --> 04:36:30.840 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you for taking my
 
04:36:33.750 --> 04:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
question um you talked about State Banks
 
04:36:35.590 --> 04:36:35.600 align:start position:0%
is that to avoid the Fed the Federal
 
04:36:38.349 --> 04:36:38.359 align:start position:0%
Reserve and how would you how would they
 
04:36:40.109 --> 04:36:40.119 align:start position:0%
clear the checks and whatever how would
 
04:36:41.830 --> 04:36:41.840 align:start position:0%
they have to have a third party or how
 
04:36:44.310 --> 04:36:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:48.070 --> 04:36:48.080 align:start position:0%
work I'll uh I'll respectfully admit
 
04:36:49.629 --> 04:36:49.639 align:start position:0%
that I am not an expert on the banking
 
04:36:52.189 --> 04:36:52.199 align:start position:0%
side of this but from what I understand
 
04:36:54.869 --> 04:36:54.879 align:start position:0%
uh there's still a lot of fear of
 
04:36:57.470 --> 04:36:57.480 align:start position:0%
crossing over state lines and there a
 
04:36:58.750 --> 04:36:58.760 align:start position:0%
fear that the federal government could
 
04:37:01.390 --> 04:37:01.400 align:start position:0%
intercept that I don't I I don't think
 
04:37:03.990 --> 04:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
they will but then again that's a if if
 
04:37:05.750 --> 04:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
there's $50 million being transferred
 
04:37:07.470 --> 04:37:07.480 align:start position:0%
over that you who wants to take that
 
04:37:11.349 --> 04:37:11.359 align:start position:0%
risk so the reason why say that again I
 
04:37:12.830 --> 04:37:12.840 align:start position:0%
can't imagine someone wanted to take a
 
04:37:14.709 --> 04:37:14.719 align:start position:0%
risk with $50 million transfer
 
04:37:16.510 --> 04:37:16.520 align:start position:0%
transferring it over state lines it is
 
04:37:18.990 --> 04:37:19.000 align:start position:0%
still a un necessary risk so the idea is
 
04:37:21.269 --> 04:37:21.279 align:start position:0%
to keep the Bank located in New
 
04:37:23.230 --> 04:37:23.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so it would have to be either
 
04:37:25.789 --> 04:37:25.799 align:start position:0%
be a private institution but any private
 
04:37:28.029 --> 04:37:28.039 align:start position:0%
institution that as long as it's located
 
04:37:30.830 --> 04:37:30.840 align:start position:0%
here in the state of New Hampshire would
 
04:37:33.230 --> 04:37:33.240 align:start position:0%
be able to actually fulfill I don't see
 
04:37:34.510 --> 04:37:34.520 align:start position:0%
why they wouldn't be able to fulfill the
 
04:37:38.390 --> 04:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
state's needs um and then plan B is that
 
04:37:40.189 --> 04:37:40.199 align:start position:0%
if there is no financial institution
 
04:37:42.990 --> 04:37:43.000 align:start position:0%
willing to take on that take on the
 
04:37:45.590 --> 04:37:45.600 align:start position:0%
state as a customer then the state will
 
04:37:48.510 --> 04:37:48.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:53.029 --> 04:37:53.039 align:start position:0%
themsel follow follow up yeah well the
 
04:37:55.150 --> 04:37:55.160 align:start position:0%
when you the Clearing House for checks
 
04:37:56.390 --> 04:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
in other words when you write a check
 
04:37:58.510 --> 04:37:58.520 align:start position:0%
here it probably goes into the Boston
 
04:38:01.429 --> 04:38:01.439 align:start position:0%
fed and cleared through there and that's
 
04:38:03.910 --> 04:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
you know that's the way it works now and
 
04:38:05.470 --> 04:38:05.480 align:start position:0%
and of course credit units not part of
 
04:38:07.750 --> 04:38:07.760 align:start position:0%
the FED but they do work through the fed
 
04:38:09.189 --> 04:38:09.199 align:start position:0%
you know to clear if you write a check
 
04:38:11.349 --> 04:38:11.359 align:start position:0%
at a credit unit off off a credit unit
 
04:38:14.189 --> 04:38:14.199 align:start position:0%
it works so it it's kind of interesting
 
04:38:15.310 --> 04:38:15.320 align:start position:0%
you know we got to make sure this going
 
04:38:18.269 --> 04:38:18.279 align:start position:0%
to work because you know the the FED
 
04:38:21.470 --> 04:38:21.480 align:start position:0%
it's against the law federally
 
04:38:24.709 --> 04:38:24.719 align:start position:0%
so to be honest I'm not I'm not clear
 
04:38:27.230 --> 04:38:27.240 align:start position:0%
how the I'm not sure if the medical
 
04:38:29.910 --> 04:38:29.920 align:start position:0%
facilities now would accept a check and
 
04:38:31.990 --> 04:38:32.000 align:start position:0%
but the mere Act of using a check in of
 
04:38:35.029 --> 04:38:35.039 align:start position:0%
itself is a federal crime to purchase it
 
04:38:35.039 --> 04:38:36.830 align:start position:0%
itself is a federal crime to purchase it
it

04:38:36.830 --> 04:38:36.840 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:38:39.230 --> 04:38:39.240 align:start position:0%
so although cannabis is illegal you're
 
04:38:41.349 --> 04:38:41.359 align:start position:0%
committing other Crimes by simply the
 
04:38:43.150 --> 04:38:43.160 align:start position:0%
method of which you purchased
 
04:38:45.551 --> 04:38:45.561 align:start position:0%
again another reason why I think the
 
04:38:47.709 --> 04:38:47.719 align:start position:0%
federal government has really failed not
 
04:38:49.349 --> 04:38:49.359 align:start position:0%
just New Hampshire the entire country on
 
04:38:49.359 --> 04:38:51.629 align:start position:0%
just New Hampshire the entire country on
this

04:38:51.629 --> 04:38:51.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:55.789 --> 04:38:55.799 align:start position:0%
subject further questions represent
 
04:38:59.070 --> 04:38:59.080 align:start position:0%
urle thank you Mr chair following up on
 
04:39:01.269 --> 04:39:01.279 align:start position:0%
the banking question of Representative
 
04:39:01.279 --> 04:39:03.230 align:start position:0%
the banking question of Representative
Petri

04:39:03.230 --> 04:39:03.240 align:start position:0%
Petri
 
04:39:07.150 --> 04:39:07.160 align:start position:0%
um what is to prevent the fed from just
 
04:39:09.629 --> 04:39:09.639 align:start position:0%
saying that's our money because it was
 
04:39:13.551 --> 04:39:13.561 align:start position:0%
done with drugs I mean the DEA does it
 
04:39:17.429 --> 04:39:17.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:17.439 --> 04:39:18.949 align:start position:0%
 
it

04:39:18.949 --> 04:39:18.959 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:39:21.709 --> 04:39:21.719 align:start position:0%
well if they did that to just New
 
04:39:24.709 --> 04:39:24.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and nowhere else that sounds
 
04:39:28.390 --> 04:39:28.400 align:start position:0%
like selective prosecution to me
 
04:39:31.349 --> 04:39:31.359 align:start position:0%
and I mean think about it how many
 
04:39:33.070 --> 04:39:33.080 align:start position:0%
states have medical policies how many
 
04:39:36.269 --> 04:39:36.279 align:start position:0%
states have Recreation
 
04:39:37.948 --> 04:39:37.958 align:start position:0%
and they going to just Target the state
 
04:39:39.150 --> 04:39:39.160 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire
 
04:39:41.390 --> 04:39:41.400 align:start position:0%
only just the state retail stores
 
04:39:43.150 --> 04:39:43.160 align:start position:0%
they're not going to Target the medical
 
04:39:45.510 --> 04:39:45.520 align:start position:0%
side are they going to go after the
 
04:39:47.110 --> 04:39:47.120 align:start position:0%
companies that are are they going to go
 
04:39:49.430 --> 04:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
after Fidelity and seize everyone's
 
04:39:51.708 --> 04:39:51.718 align:start position:0%
retirement accounts because because they
 
04:39:53.830 --> 04:39:53.840 align:start position:0%
own shares in the Cannabis company are
 
04:39:56.550 --> 04:39:56.560 align:start position:0%
they going to come in here and
 
04:39:58.550 --> 04:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
arrest good portion of the people in
 
04:39:58.560 --> 04:40:00.910 align:start position:0%
arrest good portion of the people in
this

04:40:00.910 --> 04:40:00.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:03.110 --> 04:40:03.120 align:start position:0%
room I'm not even sure that the federal
 
04:40:04.470 --> 04:40:04.480 align:start position:0%
government has the resources to do that
 
04:40:05.910 --> 04:40:05.920 align:start position:0%
if they want wanted
 
04:40:10.270 --> 04:40:10.280 align:start position:0%
to but is could could that could it
 
04:40:13.030 --> 04:40:13.040 align:start position:0%
happen yes but I would find it odd why
 
04:40:14.750 --> 04:40:14.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire specifically was targeted
 
04:40:17.830 --> 04:40:17.840 align:start position:0%
as opposed to some of the other states
 
04:40:20.948 --> 04:40:20.958 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair any further questions
 
04:40:24.830 --> 04:40:24.840 align:start position:0%
representa Aly followed by representa
 
04:40:29.110 --> 04:40:29.120 align:start position:0%
Ames thank you uh the basis of this
 
04:40:31.350 --> 04:40:31.360 align:start position:0%
whole bill for us
 
04:40:34.390 --> 04:40:34.400 align:start position:0%
is where's the revenue coming from and
 
04:40:38.110 --> 04:40:38.120 align:start position:0%
how much much is it and I'm still maybe
 
04:40:43.390 --> 04:40:43.400 align:start position:0%
I'm just dense but uh The Liquor
 
04:40:46.628 --> 04:40:46.638 align:start position:0%
Commission authorizes these retail
 
04:40:50.030 --> 04:40:50.040 align:start position:0%
stores the retail stores then decide how
 
04:40:51.910 --> 04:40:51.920 align:start position:0%
much they're going to charge who's
 
04:40:55.830 --> 04:40:55.840 align:start position:0%
setting the price for these things and
 
04:40:58.550 --> 04:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
where do we get enough information to
 
04:41:01.390 --> 04:41:01.400 align:start position:0%
figure out what the cost basis is we
 
04:41:07.628 --> 04:41:07.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:09.628 --> 04:41:09.638 align:start position:0%
so so there is someone from The Liquor
 
04:41:10.990 --> 04:41:11.000 align:start position:0%
Commission here that that can answer
 
04:41:12.150 --> 04:41:12.160 align:start position:0%
that but my understanding is that the
 
04:41:13.868 --> 04:41:13.878 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission just as they sell
 
04:41:15.230 --> 04:41:15.240 align:start position:0%
liquor sets the
 
04:41:18.230 --> 04:41:18.240 align:start position:0%
price so when it comes to what will the
 
04:41:20.670 --> 04:41:20.680 align:start position:0%
profit be we we're talking about an
 
04:41:23.230 --> 04:41:23.240 align:start position:0%
entity that doesn't exist yet there is
 
04:41:26.390 --> 04:41:26.400 align:start position:0%
no cultivator strictly a private
 
04:41:27.990 --> 04:41:28.000 align:start position:0%
cultivator to sell to the state so to
 
04:41:29.990 --> 04:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
tell you give you an exact number I
 
04:41:33.070 --> 04:41:33.080 align:start position:0%
would be I'm using rough estimates but
 
04:41:34.910 --> 04:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
to give you a specific figure would
 
04:41:37.788 --> 04:41:37.798 align:start position:0%
would not be genuine so it would depend
 
04:41:39.430 --> 04:41:39.440 align:start position:0%
on how much it would depend on how much
 
04:41:41.590 --> 04:41:41.600 align:start position:0%
they're growing and what the market
 
04:41:44.270 --> 04:41:44.280 align:start position:0%
order is the more and more they grow
 
04:41:45.510 --> 04:41:45.520 align:start position:0%
that that's going to affect everything
 
04:41:48.430 --> 04:41:48.440 align:start position:0%
so and then some states have put some
 
04:41:50.670 --> 04:41:50.680 align:start position:0%
real restrictive regulations that end up
 
04:41:53.030 --> 04:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
costing a lot of money for the
 
04:41:56.070 --> 04:41:56.080 align:start position:0%
cultivators so if I would hope when the
 
04:41:58.030 --> 04:41:58.040 align:start position:0%
rules are established and some
 
04:41:59.390 --> 04:41:59.400 align:start position:0%
regulations come down the line that we
 
04:42:01.270 --> 04:42:01.280 align:start position:0%
don't make that mistake by making
 
04:42:03.550 --> 04:42:03.560 align:start position:0%
unnecessary burdens on the Private
 
04:42:03.560 --> 04:42:05.390 align:start position:0%
unnecessary burdens on the Private
Industry

04:42:05.390 --> 04:42:05.400 align:start position:0%
Industry
 
04:42:08.190 --> 04:42:08.200 align:start position:0%
so but it's hard to give you an exact
 
04:42:10.868 --> 04:42:10.878 align:start position:0%
number yeah I think I missed a CR
 
04:42:13.230 --> 04:42:13.240 align:start position:0%
critical part of that last piece of the
 
04:42:16.868 --> 04:42:16.878 align:start position:0%
answer but uh some states make what kind
 
04:42:16.878 --> 04:42:18.990 align:start position:0%
answer but uh some states make what kind
of

04:42:18.990 --> 04:42:19.000 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:42:21.270 --> 04:42:21.280 align:start position:0%
regulations California is a good example
 
04:42:24.270 --> 04:42:24.280 align:start position:0%
of overregulation and over
 
04:42:26.910 --> 04:42:26.920 align:start position:0%
Taxation and the problem out there right
 
04:42:30.310 --> 04:42:30.320 align:start position:0%
now is one you have the legal Market
 
04:42:33.470 --> 04:42:33.480 align:start position:0%
that's completely taken off and
 
04:42:35.470 --> 04:42:35.480 align:start position:0%
apparently doing better than the private
 
04:42:38.868 --> 04:42:38.878 align:start position:0%
sector and then there there's there's
 
04:42:41.310 --> 04:42:41.320 align:start position:0%
petitions going around pleading with for
 
04:42:43.070 --> 04:42:43.080 align:start position:0%
the state to reduce the taxes and reduce
 
04:42:44.350 --> 04:42:44.360 align:start position:0%
some of the regulations so they can at
 
04:42:46.868 --> 04:42:46.878 align:start position:0%
least come close competing with the
 
04:42:49.708 --> 04:42:49.718 align:start position:0%
price point of the legal market so the
 
04:42:51.510 --> 04:42:51.520 align:start position:0%
injuries the the industry is somewhat
 
04:42:53.990 --> 04:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
oversaturated as as a result of
 
04:42:58.550 --> 04:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
that could I just follow up follow up uh
 
04:43:03.270 --> 04:43:03.280 align:start position:0%
we have the 2020 Dr attempt to answer
 
04:43:05.708 --> 04:43:05.718 align:start position:0%
this question which which you started
 
04:43:09.470 --> 04:43:09.480 align:start position:0%
from and and they looked at the
 
04:43:11.510 --> 04:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
estimated number of New Hampshire
 
04:43:15.670 --> 04:43:15.680 align:start position:0%
residents aged 20s 20 and older uh using
 
04:43:19.470 --> 04:43:19.480 align:start position:0%
cannabis now and the ounces is used per
 
04:43:23.510 --> 04:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
year per person to try to get uh if we
 
04:43:28.510 --> 04:43:28.520 align:start position:0%
got the entire Market what uh would we
 
04:43:32.230 --> 04:43:32.240 align:start position:0%
be getting out of it at a tax rate which
 
04:43:35.390 --> 04:43:35.400 align:start position:0%
is irrelevant here
 
04:43:38.788 --> 04:43:38.798 align:start position:0%
so that you're also expecting there'd be
 
04:43:41.190 --> 04:43:41.200 align:start position:0%
some people coming across the border but
 
04:43:43.550 --> 04:43:43.560 align:start position:0%
that depends a lot on the
 
04:43:48.270 --> 04:43:48.280 align:start position:0%
price so um and their
 
04:43:51.470 --> 04:43:51.480 align:start position:0%
estimate of Revenue seems well it's
 
04:43:53.670 --> 04:43:53.680 align:start position:0%
quite low I think it's very very
 
04:43:56.990 --> 04:43:57.000 align:start position:0%
conservative but uh yours seems awfully
 
04:44:02.430 --> 04:44:02.440 align:start position:0%
high and I don't think that the Liquor
 
04:44:05.070 --> 04:44:05.080 align:start position:0%
Commission I think has just started
 
04:44:07.550 --> 04:44:07.560 align:start position:0%
thinking about this because they've just
 
04:44:13.070 --> 04:44:13.080 align:start position:0%
given us some basic uh the revenue the
 
04:44:16.150 --> 04:44:16.160 align:start position:0%
percentage tax and the
 
04:44:18.868 --> 04:44:18.878 align:start position:0%
sales uh and the revenue per capita
 
04:44:20.750 --> 04:44:20.760 align:start position:0%
which is really important to us that's
 
04:44:23.070 --> 04:44:23.080 align:start position:0%
where I started from years ago right we
 
04:44:26.788 --> 04:44:26.798 align:start position:0%
will be going over that but on it
 
04:44:28.590 --> 04:44:28.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't look like
 
04:44:31.628 --> 04:44:31.638 align:start position:0%
they've considered this from we need to
 
04:44:33.750 --> 04:44:33.760 align:start position:0%
consider this from a bunch of angles I
 
04:44:35.190 --> 04:44:35.200 align:start position:0%
think and
 
04:44:37.190 --> 04:44:37.200 align:start position:0%
and but what you're saying is the Liquor
 
04:44:40.670 --> 04:44:40.680 align:start position:0%
Commission would decide what the price
 
04:44:40.680 --> 04:44:42.190 align:start position:0%
Commission would decide what the price
should

04:44:42.190 --> 04:44:42.200 align:start position:0%
should
 
04:44:46.030 --> 04:44:46.040 align:start position:0%
be and then I guess I need to ask the
 
04:44:48.550 --> 04:44:48.560 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission how they do that so
 
04:44:50.310 --> 04:44:50.320 align:start position:0%
part of the my understanding the role of
 
04:44:53.470 --> 04:44:53.480 align:start position:0%
the Liquor Commission is to sell liquor
 
04:44:57.270 --> 04:44:57.280 align:start position:0%
and make make revenue for the state and
 
04:44:59.150 --> 04:44:59.160 align:start position:0%
they've done an excellent job doing that
 
04:45:02.390 --> 04:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
I I the figures I have from
 
04:45:05.550 --> 04:45:05.560 align:start position:0%
2020 the gross sales for liquor in New
 
04:45:09.030 --> 04:45:09.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was $765
 
04:45:12.628 --> 04:45:12.638 align:start position:0%
Million yes they've done so I and what I
 
04:45:15.788 --> 04:45:15.798 align:start position:0%
understand is about 40 to 50% of that
 
04:45:18.868 --> 04:45:18.878 align:start position:0%
those sales come from out ofate
 
04:45:21.670 --> 04:45:21.680 align:start position:0%
consumers so the re and the reason for
 
04:45:23.310 --> 04:45:23.320 align:start position:0%
that is very obvious and it's not it's
 
04:45:25.510 --> 04:45:25.520 align:start position:0%
no secret if you want to buy a bottle of
 
04:45:27.910 --> 04:45:27.920 align:start position:0%
liquor the cheapest place in New England
 
04:45:30.190 --> 04:45:30.200 align:start position:0%
to buy it is New Hampshire if you look
 
04:45:32.150 --> 04:45:32.160 align:start position:0%
at New England as if imagine if we were
 
04:45:33.590 --> 04:45:33.600 align:start position:0%
just one state and New Hampshire was a
 
04:45:36.470 --> 04:45:36.480 align:start position:0%
County we're surrounded on all sides by
 
04:45:39.910 --> 04:45:39.920 align:start position:0%
other counties selling a product with a
 
04:45:42.948 --> 04:45:42.958 align:start position:0%
high tax rate if we are right in the
 
04:45:45.310 --> 04:45:45.320 align:start position:0%
middle perfectly
 
04:45:48.150 --> 04:45:48.160 align:start position:0%
located and we what we're doing with
 
04:45:49.708 --> 04:45:49.718 align:start position:0%
liquor is we sell it for a lower price
 
04:45:52.190 --> 04:45:52.200 align:start position:0%
without a tax and it's been a model that
 
04:45:55.070 --> 04:45:55.080 align:start position:0%
has worked since the 21st amendment was
 
04:45:57.788 --> 04:45:57.798 align:start position:0%
ratified by the country we've been do
 
04:46:00.150 --> 04:46:00.160 align:start position:0%
and I looked in a book for the history
 
04:46:02.590 --> 04:46:02.600 align:start position:0%
of Salem town I live in and had a
 
04:46:03.788 --> 04:46:03.798 align:start position:0%
picture of the liquor store in Salem
 
04:46:05.430 --> 04:46:05.440 align:start position:0%
from 19 19 40 and there's cars parked
 
04:46:08.430 --> 04:46:08.440 align:start position:0%
all down Route 28 before it was heavily
 
04:46:10.550 --> 04:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
trafficked like it is today and everyone
 
04:46:11.990 --> 04:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
was buying liquor at a discount price
 
04:46:14.110 --> 04:46:14.120 align:start position:0%
it's been going on for generations and
 
04:46:15.830 --> 04:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
there's no reason why we they could not
 
04:46:18.310 --> 04:46:18.320 align:start position:0%
do that and mimic that effort with
 
04:46:20.510 --> 04:46:20.520 align:start position:0%
cannabis and that's to be honest that's
 
04:46:23.230 --> 04:46:23.240 align:start position:0%
where I came up with this idea is that
 
04:46:25.070 --> 04:46:25.080 align:start position:0%
because of the job that the good job
 
04:46:26.948 --> 04:46:26.958 align:start position:0%
they're doing with liquor I'm hoping
 
04:46:28.310 --> 04:46:28.320 align:start position:0%
they can do that but
 
04:46:30.230 --> 04:46:30.240 align:start position:0%
ultimately they need to figure out the
 
04:46:32.750 --> 04:46:32.760 align:start position:0%
price point that would make incentivize
 
04:46:34.708 --> 04:46:34.718 align:start position:0%
a consumer to come here and to purchase
 
04:46:37.030 --> 04:46:37.040 align:start position:0%
it from the the retail store not from
 
04:46:39.868 --> 04:46:39.878 align:start position:0%
the legal market and not from to get
 
04:46:41.350 --> 04:46:41.360 align:start position:0%
consumers to come here to New Hampshire
 
04:46:43.510 --> 04:46:43.520 align:start position:0%
to buy it and when they come here to buy
 
04:46:45.708 --> 04:46:45.718 align:start position:0%
cannabis they fill up their gas tanks
 
04:46:47.548 --> 04:46:47.558 align:start position:0%
they eat at our restaurants there's a
 
04:46:49.548 --> 04:46:49.558 align:start position:0%
lot of other benefits we can derive from
 
04:46:52.750 --> 04:46:52.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:57.590 --> 04:46:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:01.110 --> 04:47:01.120 align:start position:0%
ases hi you're almost
 
04:47:04.910 --> 04:47:04.920 align:start position:0%
done um so I think this is fairly simple
 
04:47:07.430 --> 04:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
stuff that I want to just make sure I
 
04:47:07.440 --> 04:47:10.350 align:start position:0%
stuff that I want to just make sure I
understand

04:47:10.350 --> 04:47:10.360 align:start position:0%
understand
 
04:47:13.110 --> 04:47:13.120 align:start position:0%
um unlike
 
04:47:15.788 --> 04:47:15.798 align:start position:0%
liquor which The Liquor Commission can
 
04:47:17.390 --> 04:47:17.400 align:start position:0%
procure from all
 
04:47:23.070 --> 04:47:23.080 align:start position:0%
over the world basically and then resell
 
04:47:26.150 --> 04:47:26.160 align:start position:0%
um cannabis which under this bill The
 
04:47:28.830 --> 04:47:28.840 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission will have a duty to
 
04:47:29.990 --> 04:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
have in its
 
04:47:33.070 --> 04:47:33.080 align:start position:0%
possession and uh
 
04:47:33.080 --> 04:47:34.708 align:start position:0%
possession and uh
sell

04:47:34.708 --> 04:47:34.718 align:start position:0%
sell
 
04:47:40.750 --> 04:47:40.760 align:start position:0%
um can as I understand it only come from
 
04:47:44.110 --> 04:47:44.120 align:start position:0%
the cultivation facilities that are
 
04:47:47.030 --> 04:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
licensed and uh the manufacturing
 
04:47:49.910 --> 04:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
facilities that are licensed in New
 
04:47:52.830 --> 04:47:52.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um am I correct in thinking
 
04:47:56.070 --> 04:47:56.080 align:start position:0%
that the sole source is New
 
04:47:59.708 --> 04:47:59.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:02.830 --> 04:48:02.840 align:start position:0%
cannabis it's it's kind of a complicated
 
04:48:04.910 --> 04:48:04.920 align:start position:0%
answer the way it's written
 
04:48:08.868 --> 04:48:08.878 align:start position:0%
it doesn't exactly state that
 
04:48:12.110 --> 04:48:12.120 align:start position:0%
specifically but if the state wanted to
 
04:48:13.510 --> 04:48:13.520 align:start position:0%
purchase cannabis from Maine
 
04:48:16.070 --> 04:48:16.080 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts California wherever and I
 
04:48:17.628 --> 04:48:17.638 align:start position:0%
really hope regardless of the federal
 
04:48:19.948 --> 04:48:19.958 align:start position:0%
prohibition we still support our local
 
04:48:22.990 --> 04:48:23.000 align:start position:0%
businesses but you would be violating
 
04:48:25.390 --> 04:48:25.400 align:start position:0%
Main's law and California's law and
 
04:48:27.910 --> 04:48:27.920 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts law if we purchased
 
04:48:30.150 --> 04:48:30.160 align:start position:0%
cannabis from those States because those
 
04:48:31.990 --> 04:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
States as part of their licensing
 
04:48:33.990 --> 04:48:34.000 align:start position:0%
requirement at least that I'm aware of
 
04:48:35.230 --> 04:48:35.240 align:start position:0%
they're not allowed to sell it to any
 
04:48:38.750 --> 04:48:38.760 align:start position:0%
entity outside of that state so we
 
04:48:40.230 --> 04:48:40.240 align:start position:0%
wouldn't as much as we may want to
 
04:48:43.230 --> 04:48:43.240 align:start position:0%
purchase from out of state we we could
 
04:48:45.990 --> 04:48:46.000 align:start position:0%
not do that but I still Envision at some
 
04:48:48.030 --> 04:48:48.040 align:start position:0%
point in time that the federal
 
04:48:51.270 --> 04:48:51.280 align:start position:0%
prohibition will be go away so the way I
 
04:48:52.948 --> 04:48:52.958 align:start position:0%
I this is I thought the way to draft
 
04:48:55.150 --> 04:48:55.160 align:start position:0%
this was was to anticipate that that
 
04:48:57.190 --> 04:48:57.200 align:start position:0%
would happen and we wouldn't have to
 
04:48:59.510 --> 04:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
rely on legislation to then remove that
 
04:49:02.830 --> 04:49:02.840 align:start position:0%
restriction that would be become extinct
 
04:49:04.548 --> 04:49:04.558 align:start position:0%
but but again because the other state
 
04:49:06.350 --> 04:49:06.360 align:start position:0%
restrictions there's not much we could
 
04:49:08.310 --> 04:49:08.320 align:start position:0%
do about that anyway
 
04:49:11.110 --> 04:49:11.120 align:start position:0%
so that could be an issue down the line
 
04:49:12.670 --> 04:49:12.680 align:start position:0%
but it just I didn't see the reason why
 
04:49:14.110 --> 04:49:14.120 align:start position:0%
we would put in there right
 
04:49:18.430 --> 04:49:18.440 align:start position:0%
now okay so at least at the start the
 
04:49:20.910 --> 04:49:20.920 align:start position:0%
source is going to be New Hampshire and
 
04:49:23.030 --> 04:49:23.040 align:start position:0%
it's going to have to be developed
 
04:49:26.350 --> 04:49:26.360 align:start position:0%
because we don't have product at that
 
04:49:29.510 --> 04:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
level that this bill assumes at this
 
04:49:31.628 --> 04:49:31.638 align:start position:0%
stage in New Hampshire is that
 
04:49:34.190 --> 04:49:34.200 align:start position:0%
correct that that is correct and that's
 
04:49:36.750 --> 04:49:36.760 align:start position:0%
why it's it's critical to to keep the
 
04:49:38.788 --> 04:49:38.798 align:start position:0%
incentive for a cultivator to actually
 
04:49:41.670 --> 04:49:41.680 align:start position:0%
want to invest in New Hampshire and grow
 
04:49:43.310 --> 04:49:43.320 align:start position:0%
here because if you make it too
 
04:49:45.110 --> 04:49:45.120 align:start position:0%
difficult for them to operate their
 
04:49:46.750 --> 04:49:46.760 align:start position:0%
business and they need to make a profit
 
04:49:49.150 --> 04:49:49.160 align:start position:0%
too the problem is is that we'll have
 
04:49:51.868 --> 04:49:51.878 align:start position:0%
these retail stores without necessarily
 
04:49:54.670 --> 04:49:54.680 align:start position:0%
A cultivator so we it really needs to be
 
04:49:56.670 --> 04:49:56.680 align:start position:0%
a a fair partnership for everyone
 
04:49:59.150 --> 04:49:59.160 align:start position:0%
involved I guess I got one follow up on
 
04:50:02.548 --> 04:50:02.558 align:start position:0%
that uh follow up so what of uh our New
 
04:50:05.070 --> 04:50:05.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire cultivators get going under
 
04:50:09.670 --> 04:50:09.680 align:start position:0%
this new umbrella new new Arrangement
 
04:50:09.680 --> 04:50:10.750 align:start position:0%
this new umbrella new new Arrangement
and

04:50:10.750 --> 04:50:10.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:50:14.510 --> 04:50:14.520 align:start position:0%
uh and are very successful in growing
 
04:50:17.390 --> 04:50:17.400 align:start position:0%
the stuff and uh now they've got more
 
04:50:20.548 --> 04:50:20.558 align:start position:0%
than the Liquor Commission needs are
 
04:50:22.590 --> 04:50:22.600 align:start position:0%
they able to sell it
 
04:50:24.708 --> 04:50:24.718 align:start position:0%
anywhere that's an excellent question
 
04:50:26.510 --> 04:50:26.520 align:start position:0%
and that's one of the questions I've
 
04:50:29.390 --> 04:50:29.400 align:start position:0%
been asked I've been asked so many times
 
04:50:30.628 --> 04:50:30.638 align:start position:0%
about that problem there's a lot of
 
04:50:32.948 --> 04:50:32.958 align:start position:0%
concerns with that now the way from what
 
04:50:34.868 --> 04:50:34.878 align:start position:0%
I understand is that if the state is in
 
04:50:36.708 --> 04:50:36.718 align:start position:0%
is going to purchase from the cultivator
 
04:50:38.270 --> 04:50:38.280 align:start position:0%
there would be a certain
 
04:50:42.390 --> 04:50:42.400 align:start position:0%
order amount that they're requesting so
 
04:50:44.628 --> 04:50:44.638 align:start position:0%
I would just presume someone would not
 
04:50:46.548 --> 04:50:46.558 align:start position:0%
grow more than what the purchase order
 
04:50:51.788 --> 04:50:51.798 align:start position:0%
is is asking for now I I suggested other
 
04:50:54.548 --> 04:50:54.558 align:start position:0%
ways to address that for example let say
 
04:50:56.150 --> 04:50:56.160 align:start position:0%
a cultivation facility sold their own
 
04:50:58.910 --> 04:50:58.920 align:start position:0%
product on site that would be one way to
 
04:51:00.548 --> 04:51:00.558 align:start position:0%
mitigate some of the potential losses
 
04:51:02.670 --> 04:51:02.680 align:start position:0%
but again Rome wasn't built in a day and
 
04:51:04.670 --> 04:51:04.680 align:start position:0%
I think there's a lot of what if we do
 
04:51:06.230 --> 04:51:06.240 align:start position:0%
this what if we do that what if we do
 
04:51:08.670 --> 04:51:08.680 align:start position:0%
this I think this is this is a program
 
04:51:10.150 --> 04:51:10.160 align:start position:0%
that we need to kind of get it going get
 
04:51:12.990 --> 04:51:13.000 align:start position:0%
up and running and will there be changes
 
04:51:16.548 --> 04:51:16.558 align:start position:0%
to it I can I I foresee that
 
04:51:18.750 --> 04:51:18.760 align:start position:0%
happening so I also don't think there
 
04:51:21.470 --> 04:51:21.480 align:start position:0%
will be 15 cultivat is opened
 
04:51:23.910 --> 04:51:23.920 align:start position:0%
overnight and as the stores expand so
 
04:51:26.070 --> 04:51:26.080 align:start position:0%
will the demand from the I didn't hear
 
04:51:28.590 --> 04:51:28.600 align:start position:0%
as the stores expand no before that you
 
04:51:32.788 --> 04:51:32.798 align:start position:0%
said you think that there will not be 15
 
04:51:34.948 --> 04:51:34.958 align:start position:0%
cultivators to start with I don't I
 
04:51:36.830 --> 04:51:36.840 align:start position:0%
don't think on day one I didn't hear you
 
04:51:38.390 --> 04:51:38.400 align:start position:0%
that's all when on the first day that
 
04:51:40.628 --> 04:51:40.638 align:start position:0%
the first retail stores open I I would
 
04:51:42.708 --> 04:51:42.718 align:start position:0%
find it hard to believe that there's 15
 
04:51:44.948 --> 04:51:44.958 align:start position:0%
right cultivators up and running at Max
 
04:51:47.750 --> 04:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
Max Capacity I understand
 
04:51:51.190 --> 04:51:51.200 align:start position:0%
that okay I want to remind the committee
 
04:51:54.070 --> 04:51:54.080 align:start position:0%
we have about 14 more pink
 
04:51:57.750 --> 04:51:57.760 align:start position:0%
cards and it looks like we're definitely
 
04:51:59.708 --> 04:51:59.718 align:start position:0%
going to have
 
04:52:03.750 --> 04:52:03.760 align:start position:0%
to continue the hearing if we run out of
 
04:52:03.760 --> 04:52:05.868 align:start position:0%
to continue the hearing if we run out of
time

04:52:05.868 --> 04:52:05.878 align:start position:0%
time
 
04:52:09.470 --> 04:52:09.480 align:start position:0%
today representative Aaron thank you Mr
 
04:52:10.788 --> 04:52:10.798 align:start position:0%
chair and I don't know if this is going
 
04:52:14.110 --> 04:52:14.120 align:start position:0%
to be a quick question or not but I'm
 
04:52:16.390 --> 04:52:16.400 align:start position:0%
interested to know is there an any
 
04:52:18.830 --> 04:52:18.840 align:start position:0%
estimate for the revenues that we would
 
04:52:21.590 --> 04:52:21.600 align:start position:0%
get for licensing for these
 
04:52:25.670 --> 04:52:25.680 align:start position:0%
manufacturers or suppliers and and are
 
04:52:30.470 --> 04:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:32.628 --> 04:52:32.638 align:start position:0%
annual I'm drawing a blank I don't
 
04:52:34.190 --> 04:52:34.200 align:start position:0%
believe that the revenue projection
 
04:52:36.150 --> 04:52:36.160 align:start position:0%
takes into consideration the licensing
 
04:52:40.310 --> 04:52:40.320 align:start position:0%
fees and application fees um and I don't
 
04:52:42.510 --> 04:52:42.520 align:start position:0%
recall if the bill reserve the right for
 
04:52:44.788 --> 04:52:44.798 align:start position:0%
liquor to have Annual fees that that off
 
04:52:45.590 --> 04:52:45.600 align:start position:0%
the top of my head I don't I don't
 
04:52:47.350 --> 04:52:47.360 align:start position:0%
recall the answer okay thank you but
 
04:52:48.948 --> 04:52:48.958 align:start position:0%
that should be if it's not in there then
 
04:52:51.788 --> 04:52:51.798 align:start position:0%
should certainly be addressed thank you
 
04:52:53.830 --> 04:52:53.840 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
04:52:56.470 --> 04:52:56.480 align:start position:0%
answer want to answer a question Mr
 
04:52:58.230 --> 04:52:58.240 align:start position:0%
chairman if it would please the
 
04:53:01.708 --> 04:53:01.718 align:start position:0%
committee I can I don't mind taking a
 
04:53:03.350 --> 04:53:03.360 align:start position:0%
break and coming back answering more
 
04:53:04.548 --> 04:53:04.558 align:start position:0%
question question maybe perhaps let some
 
04:53:05.948 --> 04:53:05.958 align:start position:0%
members of the public one more question
 
04:53:10.788 --> 04:53:10.798 align:start position:0%
and then we'll do that it's me
 
04:53:13.670 --> 04:53:13.680 align:start position:0%
again so I think there's there's
 
04:53:16.030 --> 04:53:16.040 align:start position:0%
provision for licenses you know licenses
 
04:53:17.670 --> 04:53:17.680 align:start position:0%
but you you left all of that to the
 
04:53:20.708 --> 04:53:20.718 align:start position:0%
rules that appears in this bill license
 
04:53:22.708 --> 04:53:22.718 align:start position:0%
what the fees would be the whether they'
 
04:53:26.350 --> 04:53:26.360 align:start position:0%
be annual fees initial buyin fees that
 
04:53:27.830 --> 04:53:27.840 align:start position:0%
that seems to be pretty Broad in the
 
04:53:30.548 --> 04:53:30.558 align:start position:0%
bill that it's a a rules thing uh
 
04:53:31.990 --> 04:53:32.000 align:start position:0%
although I'd like to see that in the
 
04:53:35.070 --> 04:53:35.080 align:start position:0%
bill myself um and I forgot what the
 
04:53:38.030 --> 04:53:38.040 align:start position:0%
other thing was I was going to say oh
 
04:53:40.830 --> 04:53:40.840 align:start position:0%
again back to the back to the
 
04:53:40.840 --> 04:53:42.788 align:start position:0%
again back to the back to the
atcs

04:53:42.788 --> 04:53:42.798 align:start position:0%
atcs
 
04:53:45.948 --> 04:53:45.958 align:start position:0%
now the atcs there's three manufactur
 
04:53:47.628 --> 04:53:47.638 align:start position:0%
there's three growing sites in this
 
04:53:49.708 --> 04:53:49.718 align:start position:0%
state already that are make could be
 
04:53:51.868 --> 04:53:51.878 align:start position:0%
more but three the three businesses that
 
04:53:54.990 --> 04:53:55.000 align:start position:0%
own these current atcs in our state 7
 
04:53:56.110 --> 04:53:56.120 align:start position:0%
have growing
 
04:53:58.910 --> 04:53:58.920 align:start position:0%
sites is there any reason to think that
 
04:53:58.920 --> 04:54:00.070 align:start position:0%
sites is there any reason to think that
these

04:54:00.070 --> 04:54:00.080 align:start position:0%
these
 
04:54:02.548 --> 04:54:02.558 align:start position:0%
nonprofits can grow and sell to the
 
04:54:04.830 --> 04:54:04.840 align:start position:0%
state as well
 
04:54:06.830 --> 04:54:06.840 align:start position:0%
I I I I don't know the answer to that I
 
04:54:07.750 --> 04:54:07.760 align:start position:0%
don't know if you know the answer to
 
04:54:09.590 --> 04:54:09.600 align:start position:0%
that either I I don't want to speak for
 
04:54:12.190 --> 04:54:12.200 align:start position:0%
all three of them I I'm not going to
 
04:54:13.430 --> 04:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
name any companies by name I don't want
 
04:54:15.628 --> 04:54:15.638 align:start position:0%
to give anyone an official endorsement
 
04:54:18.270 --> 04:54:18.280 align:start position:0%
but the two of them have confirmed that
 
04:54:21.150 --> 04:54:21.160 align:start position:0%
they could in increase their production
 
04:54:23.150 --> 04:54:23.160 align:start position:0%
now without knowing this what the state
 
04:54:25.350 --> 04:54:25.360 align:start position:0%
would demand could they fill it I mean
 
04:54:27.190 --> 04:54:27.200 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't be able to know the number
 
04:54:29.670 --> 04:54:29.680 align:start position:0%
but a lot of them have the facility
 
04:54:31.510 --> 04:54:31.520 align:start position:0%
already in place there are some the
 
04:54:33.628 --> 04:54:33.638 align:start position:0%
integration is difficult because they're
 
04:54:35.910 --> 04:54:35.920 align:start position:0%
not for profit also they're not
 
04:54:37.750 --> 04:54:37.760 align:start position:0%
regulated they're regulated by another
 
04:54:40.110 --> 04:54:40.120 align:start position:0%
commission already so the integration of
 
04:54:42.030 --> 04:54:42.040 align:start position:0%
that is would be difficult but I
 
04:54:45.150 --> 04:54:45.160 align:start position:0%
certainly would have no objection to
 
04:54:48.990 --> 04:54:49.000 align:start position:0%
that okay the final one representative P
 
04:54:51.628 --> 04:54:51.638 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and uh thanks for
 
04:54:55.910 --> 04:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
the uh great answers to the questions uh
 
04:54:58.948 --> 04:54:58.958 align:start position:0%
we're we've got 376 million
 
04:55:02.070 --> 04:55:02.080 align:start position:0%
approximately request for new
 
04:55:08.230 --> 04:55:08.240 align:start position:0%
money 100 into that is uh the YDC
 
04:55:10.670 --> 04:55:10.680 align:start position:0%
settlement uh and what are you
 
04:55:10.680 --> 04:55:12.110 align:start position:0%
settlement uh and what are you
requesting

04:55:12.110 --> 04:55:12.120 align:start position:0%
requesting
 
04:55:15.708 --> 04:55:15.718 align:start position:0%
actually I heard 50 million is it or is
 
04:55:18.868 --> 04:55:18.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:21.390 --> 04:55:21.400 align:start position:0%
million are you referring to the initial
 
04:55:24.510 --> 04:55:24.520 align:start position:0%
appropriation to start up yes the
 
04:55:26.350 --> 04:55:26.360 align:start position:0%
initial startup appropriation would be
 
04:55:29.270 --> 04:55:29.280 align:start position:0%
$14 million half of that is actually to
 
04:55:31.310 --> 04:55:31.320 align:start position:0%
buy inventory to
 
04:55:35.470 --> 04:55:35.480 align:start position:0%
sell and then all that money as written
 
04:55:37.548 --> 04:55:37.558 align:start position:0%
would have to be repaid back to the
 
04:55:41.708 --> 04:55:41.718 align:start position:0%
state followup now these yeah thank you
 
04:55:44.070 --> 04:55:44.080 align:start position:0%
uh these 10 stores would they be rented
 
04:55:47.350 --> 04:55:47.360 align:start position:0%
spaces or I heard that they were uh I
 
04:55:48.990 --> 04:55:49.000 align:start position:0%
heard rumors that they were building
 
04:55:49.000 --> 04:55:50.470 align:start position:0%
heard rumors that they were building
these

04:55:50.470 --> 04:55:50.480 align:start position:0%
these
 
04:55:53.670 --> 04:55:53.680 align:start position:0%
buildings it in the appropriation
 
04:55:55.868 --> 04:55:55.878 align:start position:0%
estimate it does discuss rent and leases
 
04:55:58.470 --> 04:55:58.480 align:start position:0%
and it discusses build outs so with what
 
04:56:00.270 --> 04:56:00.280 align:start position:0%
you see with a lot of commercial
 
04:56:02.830 --> 04:56:02.840 align:start position:0%
properties you know the the tenant often
 
04:56:04.470 --> 04:56:04.480 align:start position:0%
pays the cost with some of the buildout
 
04:56:06.270 --> 04:56:06.280 align:start position:0%
that's that's in that's on a Case by
 
04:56:10.110 --> 04:56:10.120 align:start position:0%
case base that's part of the lease um so
 
04:56:13.030 --> 04:56:13.040 align:start position:0%
it says the lease portion but I don't
 
04:56:14.948 --> 04:56:14.958 align:start position:0%
believe that they would be necessarily
 
04:56:17.868 --> 04:56:17.878 align:start position:0%
restricted to only renting longterm
 
04:56:19.708 --> 04:56:19.718 align:start position:0%
perhaps purchasing would be better but
 
04:56:23.948 --> 04:56:23.958 align:start position:0%
at the same time R wasn't built in a day
 
04:56:25.948 --> 04:56:25.958 align:start position:0%
so thank
 
04:56:29.548 --> 04:56:29.558 align:start position:0%
you well thank you for now repr
 
04:56:32.270 --> 04:56:32.280 align:start position:0%

04:56:32.280 --> 04:56:34.628 align:start position:0%

uh what I want to remind
 
04:56:40.670 --> 04:56:40.680 align:start position:0%
everybody as you have heard we're
 
04:56:44.788 --> 04:56:44.798 align:start position:0%
concentrating on the revenue and
 
04:56:47.270 --> 04:56:47.280 align:start position:0%
appropriation part of this and anything
 
04:56:49.750 --> 04:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
associated with the banking not the
 
04:56:52.628 --> 04:56:52.638 align:start position:0%
policy because it's already been settled
 
04:56:55.788 --> 04:56:55.798 align:start position:0%
so the first one is the next is
 
04:56:58.628 --> 04:56:58.638 align:start position:0%

entire committee Mr chair
 
04:57:19.470 --> 04:57:19.480 align:start position:0%

today to speak on behalf of House Bill
 
04:57:27.470 --> 04:57:27.480 align:start position:0%
1598 1589 excuse
 
04:57:31.868 --> 04:57:31.878 align:start position:0%
me um I represent the towns in Grafton 2
 
04:57:34.948 --> 04:57:34.958 align:start position:0%
of Franconia Lisbon Lyman Monroe and
 
04:57:37.350 --> 04:57:37.360 align:start position:0%
Sugar Hill I serve as the chair of the
 
04:57:40.310 --> 04:57:40.320 align:start position:0%
house Democratic caucus for cannabis and
 
04:57:41.990 --> 04:57:42.000 align:start position:0%

environmental social and governance
 
04:57:45.390 --> 04:57:45.400 align:start position:0%
committee for the National Organization
 
04:57:47.110 --> 04:57:47.120 align:start position:0%
called the Cannabis certification
 
04:57:49.350 --> 04:57:49.360 align:start position:0%
Council they promote sustainability in
 
04:57:52.070 --> 04:57:52.080 align:start position:0%
the industry Nationwide I'm here to
 
04:57:54.310 --> 04:57:54.320 align:start position:0%
support this bill but I request that we
 
04:57:55.948 --> 04:57:55.958 align:start position:0%
improve the bill because we're leaving
 
04:57:58.350 --> 04:57:58.360 align:start position:0%
revenue on the table that is driven from
 
04:57:59.750 --> 04:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
our Local Economic Development
 
04:58:01.910 --> 04:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
opportunities and awareness of a current
 
04:58:03.670 --> 04:58:03.680 align:start position:0%
market Direction
 
04:58:04.868 --> 04:58:04.878 align:start position:0%
first you should know that sales of
 
04:58:06.270 --> 04:58:06.280 align:start position:0%
regulated cannabis products in the US
 
04:58:10.110 --> 04:58:10.120 align:start position:0%
are expected to top out at $27 billion
 
04:58:14.350 --> 04:58:14.360 align:start position:0%
in 2021 that's up roughly 25% from 2020
 
04:58:16.788 --> 04:58:16.798 align:start position:0%
according to Leading cannabis marketing
 
04:58:21.150 --> 04:58:21.160 align:start position:0%
analysis firm bdsa 2020 sales came in at
 
04:58:23.708 --> 04:58:23.718 align:start position:0%
17.6 billion making it a banner year for
 
04:58:25.750 --> 04:58:25.760 align:start position:0%
the Cannabis industry for dispensaries
 
04:58:27.628 --> 04:58:27.638 align:start position:0%
that were recognized as essential
 
04:58:31.430 --> 04:58:31.440 align:start position:0%
businesses during Co pandemic just like
 
04:58:33.750 --> 04:58:33.760 align:start position:0%
state liquor stores were
 
04:58:37.470 --> 04:58:37.480 align:start position:0%
and bdsa expects the market to reach $41
 
04:58:42.070 --> 04:58:42.080 align:start position:0%
billion by 2026 just four years from now
 
04:58:44.470 --> 04:58:44.480 align:start position:0%
but the bill leaves out our helded New
 
04:58:46.230 --> 04:58:46.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire small business community and
 
04:58:48.310 --> 04:58:48.320 align:start position:0%
one way to remedy that is amending the
 
04:58:51.070 --> 04:58:51.080 align:start position:0%
bill to allow for the selling of th
 
04:58:54.548 --> 04:58:54.558 align:start position:0%
infused products or what we call Edibles
 
04:58:57.110 --> 04:58:57.120 align:start position:0%
to allow it for sale to adult consumers
 
04:58:59.510 --> 04:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
that way this could be done via an
 
04:59:00.910 --> 04:59:00.920 align:start position:0%
amendment and I'm actually prepared to
 
04:59:03.190 --> 04:59:03.200 align:start position:0%
file that Amendment if need be but what
 
04:59:06.708 --> 04:59:06.718 align:start position:0%
concerns me in this bill is the reason
 
04:59:08.788 --> 04:59:08.798 align:start position:0%
why this needs to be done it defines
 
04:59:10.868 --> 04:59:10.878 align:start position:0%
possession as
 
04:59:13.030 --> 04:59:13.040 align:start position:0%
limiting cannabis infused products
 
04:59:15.150 --> 04:59:15.160 align:start position:0%
containing THC purchased from the retail
 
04:59:17.628 --> 04:59:17.638 align:start position:0%
cannabis store which shall be limited to
 
04:59:19.948 --> 04:59:19.958 align:start position:0%
medical use only for which the purchaser
 
04:59:22.230 --> 04:59:22.240 align:start position:0%
presents documentation permitting use of
 
04:59:24.628 --> 04:59:24.638 align:start position:0%
cannabis for medical purposes and which
 
04:59:26.750 --> 04:59:26.760 align:start position:0%
shall not contain more than two grams of
 
04:59:29.470 --> 04:59:29.480 align:start position:0%
THC this is hard to understand because
 
04:59:33.670 --> 04:59:33.680 align:start position:0%
basically what it says is adult use
 
04:59:39.628 --> 04:59:39.638 align:start position:0%
has no access to Edibles yet
 
04:59:43.510 --> 04:59:43.520 align:start position:0%
medical users can but we're going to
 
04:59:46.830 --> 04:59:46.840 align:start position:0%
allow medical products to be sold in
 
04:59:50.990 --> 04:59:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:53.628 --> 04:59:53.638 align:start position:0%
allow medicinal stores which we already
 
04:59:58.590 --> 04:59:58.600 align:start position:0%
have to sell that so this bill has a
 
05:00:00.190 --> 05:00:00.200 align:start position:0%
little bit of an inherent problem there
 
05:00:01.750 --> 05:00:01.760 align:start position:0%
and we're leaving money on the table
 
05:00:04.070 --> 05:00:04.080 align:start position:0%
because what this does
 
05:00:07.708 --> 05:00:07.718 align:start position:0%
adult use access to Edibles continues to
 
05:00:09.510 --> 05:00:09.520 align:start position:0%
draw our consumers in the United States
 
05:00:11.910 --> 05:00:11.920 align:start position:0%
70% of cannabis consumers turn to
 
05:00:14.868 --> 05:00:14.878 align:start position:0%
Edibles and 34% prefer Edibles over
 
05:00:17.390 --> 05:00:17.400 align:start position:0%
inhalables or topicals and most
 
05:00:18.750 --> 05:00:18.760 align:start position:0%
importantly these Edibles would be
 
05:00:21.390 --> 05:00:21.400 align:start position:0%
required to be designed manufactured and
 
05:00:23.430 --> 05:00:23.440 align:start position:0%
distributed within New Hampshire
 
05:00:25.750 --> 05:00:25.760 align:start position:0%
improving our Local Economic Development
 
05:00:29.230 --> 05:00:29.240 align:start position:0%
opportunities Edibles occupy recently
 
05:00:31.990 --> 05:00:32.000 align:start position:0%
National nationalwide 133% of the total
 
05:00:33.990 --> 05:00:34.000 align:start position:0%
cannabis dollar
 
05:00:37.470 --> 05:00:37.480 align:start position:0%
by volume and that growth is changing
 
05:00:40.628 --> 05:00:40.638 align:start position:0%
rapidly it's outpacing the industry they
 
05:00:44.070 --> 05:00:44.080 align:start position:0%
expect Edibles to make up to up to 15 to
 
05:00:48.390 --> 05:00:48.400 align:start position:0%
18% of the market by 2025 from 133% just
 
05:00:51.390 --> 05:00:51.400 align:start position:0%
in 2020 the end of- year data for
 
05:00:53.788 --> 05:00:53.798 align:start position:0%
cannabis analytics by The Firm headset
 
05:00:56.230 --> 05:00:56.240 align:start position:0%
shows that in 2020 sales of all adult
 
05:00:59.948 --> 05:00:59.958 align:start position:0%
use medical Edibles grew by 60% across
 
05:01:04.868 --> 05:01:04.878 align:start position:0%
seven states to 1.2.3 billion from 2020
 
05:01:04.878 --> 05:01:06.310 align:start position:0%
seven states to 1.2.3 billion from 2020
from

05:01:06.310 --> 05:01:06.320 align:start position:0%
from
 
05:01:09.708 --> 05:01:09.718 align:start position:0%
676 million in 2019 that performance
 
05:01:11.788 --> 05:01:11.798 align:start position:0%
meant Edibles outperformed the total
 
05:01:13.910 --> 05:01:13.920 align:start position:0%
cannabis Market which grew at a hefty
 
05:01:17.590 --> 05:01:17.600 align:start position:0%
four 54% alone so it outgrew its own
 
05:01:19.548 --> 05:01:19.558 align:start position:0%
flower market and the seven states
 
05:01:21.430 --> 05:01:21.440 align:start position:0%
focused on obviously were California
 
05:01:23.788 --> 05:01:23.798 align:start position:0%
Colorado Massachusetts Michigan Nevada
 
05:01:26.510 --> 05:01:26.520 align:start position:0%
Oregon and Washington where adult use
 
05:01:29.548 --> 05:01:29.558 align:start position:0%
has been in existence long enough to be
 
05:01:31.948 --> 05:01:31.958 align:start position:0%
able to assess uh how these numbers can
 
05:01:36.910 --> 05:01:36.920 align:start position:0%
be of of valid use lastly um adult use
 
05:01:38.310 --> 05:01:38.320 align:start position:0%
access to Edibles would allow
 
05:01:40.310 --> 05:01:40.320 align:start position:0%
entrepreneurs within the state to make
 
05:01:42.150 --> 05:01:42.160 align:start position:0%
take their culinary skills and turn them
 
05:01:44.270 --> 05:01:44.280 align:start position:0%
into a larger margin business anyone
 
05:01:46.070 --> 05:01:46.080 align:start position:0%
that's ever had a conversation with
 
05:01:47.628 --> 05:01:47.638 align:start position:0%
someone that runs a restaurant knows the
 
05:01:49.868 --> 05:01:49.878 align:start position:0%
low margin that restaurants or catering
 
05:01:52.030 --> 05:01:52.040 align:start position:0%
offers and being able to enter into the
 
05:01:53.470 --> 05:01:53.480 align:start position:0%
edible Market could allow those
 
05:01:57.070 --> 05:01:57.080 align:start position:0%
businesses to maximize their margin um
 
05:01:58.910 --> 05:01:58.920 align:start position:0%
and we'll also be able to generate new
 
05:01:58.920 --> 05:02:00.310 align:start position:0%
and we'll also be able to generate new
agricultural

05:02:00.310 --> 05:02:00.320 align:start position:0%
agricultural
 
05:02:02.510 --> 05:02:02.520 align:start position:0%
Industries based sorry agricultural
 
05:02:04.310 --> 05:02:04.320 align:start position:0%
based Industries which helps diversify
 
05:02:06.350 --> 05:02:06.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's business structure and
 
05:02:07.788 --> 05:02:07.798 align:start position:0%
Local Economic Development will take
 
05:02:09.470 --> 05:02:09.480 align:start position:0%
place in areas of the state that want
 
05:02:11.030 --> 05:02:11.040 align:start position:0%
the Cannabis industry to be there so
 
05:02:11.910 --> 05:02:11.920 align:start position:0%
they can
 
05:02:14.708 --> 05:02:14.718 align:start position:0%
create Market areas that are similar to
 
05:02:16.270 --> 05:02:16.280 align:start position:0%
what we've done with the craft brewing
 
05:02:18.150 --> 05:02:18.160 align:start position:0%
industry and the winery
 
05:02:20.470 --> 05:02:20.480 align:start position:0%
industry Edibles are a viable business
 
05:02:22.310 --> 05:02:22.320 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire because consumers turn
 
05:02:23.948 --> 05:02:23.958 align:start position:0%
to Edibles to help them sleep better
 
05:02:25.948 --> 05:02:25.958 align:start position:0%
relax from social anxiety help relieve
 
05:02:29.030 --> 05:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
pain consumers are shying away from
 
05:02:32.070 --> 05:02:32.080 align:start position:0%
inhalable products we've all seen folks
 
05:02:33.990 --> 05:02:34.000 align:start position:0%
understand the that what they consider
 
05:02:36.030 --> 05:02:36.040 align:start position:0%
maybe the dangers of of cigarettes so
 
05:02:37.590 --> 05:02:37.600 align:start position:0%
they might not be interested in hailing
 
05:02:39.510 --> 05:02:39.520 align:start position:0%
their cannabis but they would want it in
 
05:02:41.830 --> 05:02:41.840 align:start position:0%
an edible form consumers are looking for
 
05:02:44.590 --> 05:02:44.600 align:start position:0%
more discrete options as we know a lot
 
05:02:46.270 --> 05:02:46.280 align:start position:0%
of the rules around legal adult use
 
05:02:48.270 --> 05:02:48.280 align:start position:0%
cannabis require it not to be smoked in
 
05:02:50.948 --> 05:02:50.958 align:start position:0%
a public place therefore Edibles allows
 
05:02:52.868 --> 05:02:52.878 align:start position:0%
them to consume their product without
 
05:02:55.910 --> 05:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
impacting their neighbor the
 
05:02:59.628 --> 05:02:59.638 align:start position:0%
overall Insight of this ex overall over
 
05:03:02.430 --> 05:03:02.440 align:start position:0%
excuse me the oversight of all of this
 
05:03:04.548 --> 05:03:04.558 align:start position:0%
could take place from the existing
 
05:03:06.030 --> 05:03:06.040 align:start position:0%
infrastructure that is already put in
 
05:03:08.150 --> 05:03:08.160 align:start position:0%
place in this bill so the fact that
 
05:03:10.590 --> 05:03:10.600 align:start position:0%
there is a a commission there all the
 
05:03:13.470 --> 05:03:13.480 align:start position:0%
security all the understanding that is
 
05:03:17.270 --> 05:03:17.280 align:start position:0%
put into this bill by um uh
 
05:03:19.110 --> 05:03:19.120 align:start position:0%
representative filed it and did and did
 
05:03:21.030 --> 05:03:21.040 align:start position:0%
that quite well would all be existing
 
05:03:23.948 --> 05:03:23.958 align:start position:0%
that allow Edibles to then be integrated
 
05:03:27.030 --> 05:03:27.040 align:start position:0%
into this process and lastly they would
 
05:03:29.670 --> 05:03:29.680 align:start position:0%
all oversee a more increased Revenue
 
05:03:31.830 --> 05:03:31.840 align:start position:0%
possibility for reducing property taxes
 
05:03:33.390 --> 05:03:33.400 align:start position:0%
increasing Revenue support of mental
 
05:03:35.470 --> 05:03:35.480 align:start position:0%
health care and education funding two
 
05:03:37.030 --> 05:03:37.040 align:start position:0%
things that our governor recently noted
 
05:03:39.310 --> 05:03:39.320 align:start position:0%
in his state of State address which were
 
05:03:42.190 --> 05:03:42.200 align:start position:0%
Paramount to the state of New Hampshire
 
05:03:44.430 --> 05:03:44.440 align:start position:0%
so I thank you for letting me um speak
 
05:03:46.110 --> 05:03:46.120 align:start position:0%
today it's important for me to note that
 
05:03:49.430 --> 05:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
unlike most other legalization States um
 
05:03:51.270 --> 05:03:51.280 align:start position:0%
this bill does no way change the
 
05:03:53.430 --> 05:03:53.440 align:start position:0%
penalties for the use of personal
 
05:03:55.070 --> 05:03:55.080 align:start position:0%
cultivation which would remain a
 
05:03:57.830 --> 05:03:57.840 align:start position:0%
jailable offense um if we are going to
 
05:03:59.310 --> 05:03:59.320 align:start position:0%
move this bill forward it it should
 
05:04:01.310 --> 05:04:01.320 align:start position:0%
legalize the secure discreet cultivation
 
05:04:03.628 --> 05:04:03.638 align:start position:0%
of personal cannabis and take into
 
05:04:06.430 --> 05:04:06.440 align:start position:0%
consideration the incredible economic
 
05:04:09.510 --> 05:04:09.520 align:start position:0%
impact that the edible industry uh can
 
05:04:11.708 --> 05:04:11.718 align:start position:0%
provide to our state so I thank you for
 
05:04:13.910 --> 05:04:13.920 align:start position:0%

05:04:16.230 --> 05:04:16.240 align:start position:0%
attention thank you for your testimony

you for your testimony um real quick I I
 
05:04:27.190 --> 05:04:27.200 align:start position:0%
missed the number you you current use of
 
05:04:29.110 --> 05:04:29.120 align:start position:0%
Edibles what percentage did you
 
05:04:34.230 --> 05:04:34.240 align:start position:0%
use so I right now Nationwide it's 133%
 
05:04:36.470 --> 05:04:36.480 align:start position:0%
it's going to go up to between 15 and
 
05:04:37.910 --> 05:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
18% by
 
05:04:40.070 --> 05:04:40.080 align:start position:0%
2025 and and what's the source of that
 
05:04:42.590 --> 05:04:42.600 align:start position:0%
do you know that is um an organization
 
05:04:44.628 --> 05:04:44.638 align:start position:0%
called headset they're a National
 
05:04:46.670 --> 05:04:46.680 align:start position:0%
Consumer analytics firm and I that is
 
05:04:49.070 --> 05:04:49.080 align:start position:0%
those links to those two organizations
 
05:04:50.990 --> 05:04:51.000 align:start position:0%
that I referenced in my testimony and
 
05:04:52.510 --> 05:04:52.520 align:start position:0%
you're going to send that to us I am
 
05:04:54.270 --> 05:04:54.280 align:start position:0%
going to email that to you all with the
 
05:04:55.948 --> 05:04:55.958 align:start position:0%
embedded link so you can access this
 
05:04:58.628 --> 05:04:58.638 align:start position:0%
data and one one followup on well
 
05:05:00.910 --> 05:05:00.920 align:start position:0%
another question so you mentioned
 
05:05:03.310 --> 05:05:03.320 align:start position:0%
somewhere in there that that that our
 
05:05:06.628 --> 05:05:06.638 align:start position:0%
atc's or our medical marijuana stores
 
05:05:08.430 --> 05:05:08.440 align:start position:0%
don't sell Edibles I mean they do sell
 
05:05:13.548 --> 05:05:13.558 align:start position:0%
Edibles right yeah they I'll defer to
 
05:05:15.470 --> 05:05:15.480 align:start position:0%
they believe me they do so they do what
 
05:05:18.510 --> 05:05:18.520 align:start position:0%
it does what it what it oddly does is it
 
05:05:22.548 --> 05:05:22.558 align:start position:0%
allows Edibles not to be sold to adult
 
05:05:25.230 --> 05:05:25.240 align:start position:0%
users but only to Medical users which
 
05:05:27.270 --> 05:05:27.280 align:start position:0%
basically would drive that's dis spill
 
05:05:28.510 --> 05:05:28.520 align:start position:0%
dis spill does that that's what I'm
 
05:05:30.548 --> 05:05:30.558 align:start position:0%
saying so this it would drive oh I agree
 
05:05:33.150 --> 05:05:33.160 align:start position:0%
with edible user edible those that want
 
05:05:34.750 --> 05:05:34.760 align:start position:0%
edible that are medical patients it
 
05:05:36.230 --> 05:05:36.240 align:start position:0%
would actually drive them away from
 
05:05:38.190 --> 05:05:38.200 align:start position:0%
medicinal shops that we've already
 
05:05:40.510 --> 05:05:40.520 align:start position:0%
developed and Fir and and built in this
 
05:05:42.628 --> 05:05:42.638 align:start position:0%
state so it's just confuses me I agree
 
05:05:45.070 --> 05:05:45.080 align:start position:0%
with you 100% thank you thank you
 
05:05:45.080 --> 05:05:47.910 align:start position:0%

05:05:59.390 --> 05:05:59.400 align:start position:0%
hola from Hillsboro
 
05:06:04.590 --> 05:06:04.600 align:start position:0%
County District 27 and opposition the
 
05:06:06.910 --> 05:06:06.920 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
05:06:08.788 --> 05:06:08.798 align:start position:0%
allowing me the opportunity to testify
 
05:06:10.590 --> 05:06:10.600 align:start position:0%
before I I get into my comments I'd
 
05:06:12.350 --> 05:06:12.360 align:start position:0%
actually like to make a word a little
 
05:06:15.470 --> 05:06:15.480 align:start position:0%
couple comments on Edibles in the
 
05:06:18.868 --> 05:06:18.878 align:start position:0%
medical marijuana field it is documented
 
05:06:21.310 --> 05:06:21.320 align:start position:0%
that approximately a THC level about 5
 
05:06:25.030 --> 05:06:25.040 align:start position:0%
to 10% in an edible is appropriate to
 
05:06:28.628 --> 05:06:28.638 align:start position:0%
alleviate symptoms that people seek uh
 
05:06:30.310 --> 05:06:30.320 align:start position:0%
relief for through
 
05:06:33.310 --> 05:06:33.320 align:start position:0%
marijuana right now in in the state
 
05:06:35.270 --> 05:06:35.280 align:start position:0%
sanctioned alternative medical
 
05:06:37.590 --> 05:06:37.600 align:start position:0%
facilities there are Edibles that are
 
05:06:42.030 --> 05:06:42.040 align:start position:0%
upwards of 80% THC level so when we have
 
05:06:44.270 --> 05:06:44.280 align:start position:0%
a conversation about Edibles I just want
 
05:06:46.430 --> 05:06:46.440 align:start position:0%
everyone to keep in mind that if we
 
05:06:49.670 --> 05:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
can't control or have proper oversight
 
05:06:52.590 --> 05:06:52.600 align:start position:0%
of the THC level in Edibles in the
 
05:06:55.548 --> 05:06:55.558 align:start position:0%
medical marijuana field good luck in the
 
05:06:57.350 --> 05:06:57.360 align:start position:0%
recreational that's all that's all I
 
05:06:59.948 --> 05:06:59.958 align:start position:0%
just wanted to say about that um I do
 
05:07:01.350 --> 05:07:01.360 align:start position:0%
want to say there are many singularly
 
05:07:03.030 --> 05:07:03.040 align:start position:0%
important issues wrapped up in this bill
 
05:07:04.390 --> 05:07:04.400 align:start position:0%
and I've expressed those already on the
 
05:07:06.548 --> 05:07:06.558 align:start position:0%
house floor uh when we had floor debate
 
05:07:08.628 --> 05:07:08.638 align:start position:0%
and obviously I won't cover what I have
 
05:07:10.590 --> 05:07:10.600 align:start position:0%
already spoken about even though I
 
05:07:12.150 --> 05:07:12.160 align:start position:0%
consider them to be very fundamentally
 
05:07:13.868 --> 05:07:13.878 align:start position:0%
critical to this discussion and the main
 
05:07:15.270 --> 05:07:15.280 align:start position:0%
concerns about this bill I'd like to
 
05:07:17.350 --> 05:07:17.360 align:start position:0%
address are the revenue expectations of
 
05:07:20.310 --> 05:07:20.320 align:start position:0%
this legislation in the level of detail
 
05:07:22.070 --> 05:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
regarding the fiscal analysis of the
 
05:07:24.390 --> 05:07:24.400 align:start position:0%
bill the primary selling point of this
 
05:07:26.190 --> 05:07:26.200 align:start position:0%
bill appears to be the expected revenues
 
05:07:28.430 --> 05:07:28.440 align:start position:0%
from legalization in this bill's unique
 
05:07:30.788 --> 05:07:30.798 align:start position:0%
proposal to enable the state to execute
 
05:07:32.670 --> 05:07:32.680 align:start position:0%
a business model for marijuana
 
05:07:34.670 --> 05:07:34.680 align:start position:0%
distribution it's important to note that
 
05:07:36.548 --> 05:07:36.558 align:start position:0%
in every state which has legalized
 
05:07:39.230 --> 05:07:39.240 align:start position:0%
marijuana the revenues from such sales
 
05:07:41.030 --> 05:07:41.040 align:start position:0%
have come in below projections and they
 
05:07:42.708 --> 05:07:42.718 align:start position:0%
usually represent a small portion of the
 
05:07:44.910 --> 05:07:44.920 align:start position:0%
state's budget in Massachusetts the
 
05:07:46.868 --> 05:07:46.878 align:start position:0%
first year of tax revenue for marijuana
 
05:07:48.230 --> 05:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
sales was less than half of the
 
05:07:50.830 --> 05:07:50.840 align:start position:0%
anticipated amount as rep abis has
 
05:07:52.510 --> 05:07:52.520 align:start position:0%
discussed when uh speaking about
 
05:07:55.350 --> 05:07:55.360 align:start position:0%
California in 2020 those Revenue amounts
 
05:07:56.910 --> 05:07:56.920 align:start position:0%
failed to meet their projected Target
 
05:07:59.788 --> 05:07:59.798 align:start position:0%
and it resulted in the industry um
 
05:08:01.590 --> 05:08:01.600 align:start position:0%
proponents pressuring legislators to
 
05:08:03.910 --> 05:08:03.920 align:start position:0%
reduce the sales tax on marijuana
 
05:08:05.510 --> 05:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
because the business was quote on the
 
05:08:06.750 --> 05:08:06.760 align:start position:0%
brink of
 
05:08:09.350 --> 05:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
collapse an overall analysis of how much
 
05:08:11.110 --> 05:08:11.120 align:start position:0%
marijuana Revenue actually contributes
 
05:08:12.910 --> 05:08:12.920 align:start position:0%
to a state budget would show The
 
05:08:14.470 --> 05:08:14.480 align:start position:0%
Following that in Colorado and
 
05:08:17.190 --> 05:08:17.200 align:start position:0%
Washington it's just over 1% in
 
05:08:19.628 --> 05:08:19.638 align:start position:0%
California Alaska Oregon Nevada is a
 
05:08:21.948 --> 05:08:21.958 align:start position:0%
half percent or less and as we discuss
 
05:08:24.470 --> 05:08:24.480 align:start position:0%
revenues it's important to to kind of
 
05:08:26.230 --> 05:08:26.240 align:start position:0%
consider the two statements made by two
 
05:08:29.270 --> 05:08:29.280 align:start position:0%
people in Colorado uh one of them former
 
05:08:31.830 --> 05:08:31.840 align:start position:0%
Colorado governor John Hickenlooper who
 
05:08:34.670 --> 05:08:34.680 align:start position:0%
said 2018 we get 200 million a year in
 
05:08:37.030 --> 05:08:37.040 align:start position:0%
tax revenue which you know we're a 30
 
05:08:38.750 --> 05:08:38.760 align:start position:0%
billion budget so it's a drop in the
 
05:08:40.788 --> 05:08:40.798 align:start position:0%
bucket it's not going to pay for early
 
05:08:43.070 --> 05:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
childhood education or solve any big
 
05:08:46.110 --> 05:08:46.120 align:start position:0%
social ill Andrew fredman who's a
 
05:08:48.390 --> 05:08:48.400 align:start position:0%
marijuana coordinator director said in
 
05:08:51.390 --> 05:08:51.400 align:start position:0%
2015 he's the Colorado drugs on Zar in
 
05:08:54.230 --> 05:08:54.240 align:start position:0%
2015 you do not legalize for taxation
 
05:08:56.150 --> 05:08:56.160 align:start position:0%
it's a myth you are not going to PVE
 
05:08:57.548 --> 05:08:57.558 align:start position:0%
streets you're not going to be able to
 
05:08:59.390 --> 05:08:59.400 align:start position:0%
pay teachers the big red herring of the
 
05:09:00.948 --> 05:09:00.958 align:start position:0%
whole thing is that tax revenue will
 
05:09:03.948 --> 05:09:03.958 align:start position:0%
solve a bunch of crisises but it won't
 
05:09:05.470 --> 05:09:05.480 align:start position:0%
it's important to note that in Colorado
 
05:09:08.230 --> 05:09:08.240 align:start position:0%
for every uh dollar gained it is also
 
05:09:11.628 --> 05:09:11.638 align:start position:0%
spent four $450 cents to mitigate the
 
05:09:13.510 --> 05:09:13.520 align:start position:0%
negative effects of legalization has had
 
05:09:15.910 --> 05:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
on its citizens as we know the
 
05:09:17.750 --> 05:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
proponents of this bill have crafted the
 
05:09:20.190 --> 05:09:20.200 align:start position:0%
bill so it avoids being considered a tax
 
05:09:21.910 --> 05:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
and allows the state to be a business
 
05:09:24.910 --> 05:09:24.920 align:start position:0%
stakeholder of marijuana sales revenue
 
05:09:27.788 --> 05:09:27.798 align:start position:0%
regardless of how the revenue is derived
 
05:09:29.708 --> 05:09:29.718 align:start position:0%
actuated Revenue history shows that the
 
05:09:31.390 --> 05:09:31.400 align:start position:0%
anticipated dollar amount will fall
 
05:09:31.400 --> 05:09:32.628 align:start position:0%
anticipated dollar amount will fall
short

05:09:32.628 --> 05:09:32.638 align:start position:0%
short
 
05:09:34.110 --> 05:09:34.120 align:start position:0%
adding to this is the fact that New
 
05:09:35.628 --> 05:09:35.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire will also be on the hook to
 
05:09:37.310 --> 05:09:37.320 align:start position:0%
support the entire business model for
 
05:09:39.110 --> 05:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
these sales which is a whole other
 
05:09:41.628 --> 05:09:41.638 align:start position:0%
benefit cost analysis factor that other
 
05:09:44.628 --> 05:09:44.638 align:start position:0%
legalized states are not encumbered by
 
05:09:46.310 --> 05:09:46.320 align:start position:0%
with regard to the fiscal analysis this
 
05:09:48.470 --> 05:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
bill appropriates 14 million for startup
 
05:09:50.150 --> 05:09:50.160 align:start position:0%
costs as we've already discussed to run
 
05:09:52.110 --> 05:09:52.120 align:start position:0%
these stores the 10 state run stores at
 
05:09:54.470 --> 05:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
the outset as any business owner will
 
05:09:56.510 --> 05:09:56.520 align:start position:0%
know as knows that projected startup
 
05:09:58.590 --> 05:09:58.600 align:start position:0%
costs never equate to actual costs it's
 
05:10:00.670 --> 05:10:00.680 align:start position:0%
important to note that this $14 million
 
05:10:03.030 --> 05:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
figure does not as we've discussed here
 
05:10:04.670 --> 05:10:04.680 align:start position:0%
today it does not clearly factor in a
 
05:10:06.830 --> 05:10:06.840 align:start position:0%
thorough analysis on how much funding
 
05:10:07.910 --> 05:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
each of these stores will need to
 
05:10:10.948 --> 05:10:10.958 align:start position:0%
operate from a facility standpoint or a
 
05:10:12.708 --> 05:10:12.718 align:start position:0%
complete real estate analysis on the
 
05:10:14.350 --> 05:10:14.360 align:start position:0%
size of each facility as compared with
 
05:10:15.990 --> 05:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
market value rates for commercial
 
05:10:18.708 --> 05:10:18.718 align:start position:0%
property more importantly there's little
 
05:10:20.628 --> 05:10:20.638 align:start position:0%
information provided on the cost of the
 
05:10:22.750 --> 05:10:22.760 align:start position:0%
contracts the state must enter into with
 
05:10:24.350 --> 05:10:24.360 align:start position:0%
the marijuana producers so they can
 
05:10:27.110 --> 05:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
supply high concentrate THC product to
 
05:10:28.110 --> 05:10:28.120 align:start position:0%
the state
 
05:10:31.470 --> 05:10:31.480 align:start position:0%
stores from a fiscal uh perspective this
 
05:10:33.390 --> 05:10:33.400 align:start position:0%
bill appro Ates an enormous amount of
 
05:10:35.750 --> 05:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
taxpayer money before $1 of Revenue is
 
05:10:37.708 --> 05:10:37.718 align:start position:0%
realized and the amount of the
 
05:10:39.470 --> 05:10:39.480 align:start position:0%
appropriation has not factored in some
 
05:10:41.510 --> 05:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
of the most critical costs it merely
 
05:10:44.270 --> 05:10:44.280 align:start position:0%
throws out a number without proper
 
05:10:46.910 --> 05:10:46.920 align:start position:0%
valuation an appropr appropriation this
 
05:10:49.070 --> 05:10:49.080 align:start position:0%
large for business model that has never
 
05:10:51.030 --> 05:10:51.040 align:start position:0%
been tried in any other state needs a
 
05:10:53.190 --> 05:10:53.200 align:start position:0%
more thorough evaluation before we jump
 
05:10:56.230 --> 05:10:56.240 align:start position:0%
in with both feet and no safety net
 
05:10:59.948 --> 05:10:59.958 align:start position:0%
Canada Canada has in fact tried a state
 
05:11:02.310 --> 05:11:02.320 align:start position:0%
uh provincial run model and that effort
 
05:11:05.030 --> 05:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
failed at Great cost to their taxpayers
 
05:11:06.430 --> 05:11:06.440 align:start position:0%
the Canadian government gave the
 
05:11:09.230 --> 05:11:09.240 align:start position:0%
provinces two options provide private
 
05:11:11.628 --> 05:11:11.638 align:start position:0%
retail sales for marijuana or state or
 
05:11:14.430 --> 05:11:14.440 align:start position:0%
set up a state run option both Quebec
 
05:11:17.708 --> 05:11:17.718 align:start position:0%
and on and Ontario uh set up state run
 
05:11:20.510 --> 05:11:20.520 align:start position:0%
options Quebec is still struggling but
 
05:11:23.150 --> 05:11:23.160 align:start position:0%
Ontario is already given up according to
 
05:11:24.948 --> 05:11:24.958 align:start position:0%
the Canadian broadcast Corporation news
 
05:11:27.830 --> 05:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
report in 2019 the Ontario retail
 
05:11:30.230 --> 05:11:30.240 align:start position:0%
Corporation racked up $106 million in
 
05:11:32.750 --> 05:11:32.760 align:start position:0%
expenses but only made6 64 million in
 
05:11:35.628 --> 05:11:35.638 align:start position:0%
sales resulting in a loss of 42
 
05:11:38.030 --> 05:11:38.040 align:start position:0%
million the Ontario government also set
 
05:11:39.670 --> 05:11:39.680 align:start position:0%
up growing sites costing tens of
 
05:11:41.670 --> 05:11:41.680 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars and then squandered
 
05:11:43.310 --> 05:11:43.320 align:start position:0%
a total of $80 million trying to figure
 
05:11:45.628 --> 05:11:45.638 align:start position:0%
out how to operate them it got so
 
05:11:47.470 --> 05:11:47.480 align:start position:0%
honorous that they gave up and let the
 
05:11:49.150 --> 05:11:49.160 align:start position:0%
contracts go to private companies and
 
05:11:51.270 --> 05:11:51.280 align:start position:0%
meanwhile the grow sites produced a a
 
05:11:53.590 --> 05:11:53.600 align:start position:0%
huge amount of marijuana with no shops
 
05:11:54.990 --> 05:11:55.000 align:start position:0%
to sell it
 
05:11:57.670 --> 05:11:57.680 align:start position:0%
in it's not clear from the Press reports
 
05:11:59.110 --> 05:11:59.120 align:start position:0%
where they stand exactly now but the
 
05:12:01.350 --> 05:12:01.360 align:start position:0%
roll out in Ontario with their state run
 
05:12:02.990 --> 05:12:03.000 align:start position:0%
stores was
 
05:12:05.230 --> 05:12:05.240 align:start position:0%
disastrous also a recent Canadian
 
05:12:07.910 --> 05:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
government National survey found that
 
05:12:09.948 --> 05:12:09.958 align:start position:0%
despite the government sanctioned retail
 
05:12:13.830 --> 05:12:13.840 align:start position:0%
effort 40% of marijuana users still buy
 
05:12:15.310 --> 05:12:15.320 align:start position:0%
their marijuana illegally through the
 
05:12:17.070 --> 05:12:17.080 align:start position:0%
back black
 
05:12:19.670 --> 05:12:19.680 align:start position:0%
market perhaps we should examine
 
05:12:22.110 --> 05:12:22.120 align:start position:0%
Canada's risky experiment before we jump
 
05:12:25.708 --> 05:12:25.718 align:start position:0%
into uh jump into our own in closing I'd
 
05:12:27.070 --> 05:12:27.080 align:start position:0%
like to add that the more that we dig
 
05:12:28.910 --> 05:12:28.920 align:start position:0%
into the specifics of this bill the more
 
05:12:30.350 --> 05:12:30.360 align:start position:0%
questions are raised about the fiscal
 
05:12:32.548 --> 05:12:32.558 align:start position:0%
soundness of The Proposal
 
05:12:34.788 --> 05:12:34.798 align:start position:0%
it's clear from other legalization
 
05:12:36.590 --> 05:12:36.600 align:start position:0%
efforts and some of the discussions that
 
05:12:38.990 --> 05:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
this is a complex public health issue
 
05:12:41.430 --> 05:12:41.440 align:start position:0%
and a business model and it has not been
 
05:12:43.750 --> 05:12:43.760 align:start position:0%
executed as expected in any
 
05:12:45.910 --> 05:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
location instead of rushing headlong
 
05:12:47.628 --> 05:12:47.638 align:start position:0%
into the experiment perhaps a more
 
05:12:49.150 --> 05:12:49.160 align:start position:0%
apprpriate step would be to consider an
 
05:12:51.270 --> 05:12:51.280 align:start position:0%
interim study so that we may at the very
 
05:12:53.230 --> 05:12:53.240 align:start position:0%
least fully understand the fiscal
 
05:12:56.990 --> 05:12:57.000 align:start position:0%
implications uh to taxpayers and in Off
 
05:12:58.750 --> 05:12:58.760 align:start position:0%
Script I'd like to add in one more
 
05:13:02.230 --> 05:13:02.240 align:start position:0%
comment but if we make a decision to
 
05:13:06.470 --> 05:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
legalize marijuana on the promise that
 
05:13:06.480 --> 05:13:07.470 align:start position:0%
legalize marijuana on the promise that
it

05:13:07.470 --> 05:13:07.480 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:13:11.270 --> 05:13:11.280 align:start position:0%
will get take away uh Statewide property
 
05:13:14.030 --> 05:13:14.040 align:start position:0%
tax it'll be a huge benefit to people
 
05:13:16.910 --> 05:13:16.920 align:start position:0%
it'll reduce property taxes then we've
 
05:13:19.670 --> 05:13:19.680 align:start position:0%
already lowered the bar and said
 
05:13:22.628 --> 05:13:22.638 align:start position:0%
that basically any drug if it's worth
 
05:13:27.110 --> 05:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
the cost is beneficial thank you well
 
05:13:30.750 --> 05:13:30.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for the testimony
 
05:13:30.760 --> 05:13:32.470 align:start position:0%
thank you for the testimony
U

05:13:32.470 --> 05:13:32.480 align:start position:0%
U
 
05:13:34.750 --> 05:13:34.760 align:start position:0%
and you'll answer questions yes sir
 
05:13:37.830 --> 05:13:37.840 align:start position:0%
representa BR yes thank you and thank
 
05:13:40.750 --> 05:13:40.760 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony uh the 64 million
 
05:13:43.708 --> 05:13:43.718 align:start position:0%
that first that that was for cbec uh
 
05:13:46.190 --> 05:13:46.200 align:start position:0%
Ontario I guess Ontario Ontario that was
 
05:13:49.670 --> 05:13:49.680 align:start position:0%
the gross number gross sales uh uh
 
05:13:51.470 --> 05:13:51.480 align:start position:0%
according to the data I looked at it
 
05:13:54.190 --> 05:13:54.200 align:start position:0%
said 64 million in sales so I'm assuming
 
05:13:55.948 --> 05:13:55.958 align:start position:0%
that means that's the net can you
 
05:13:59.030 --> 05:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
provide us the uh the source of the
 
05:14:01.788 --> 05:14:01.798 align:start position:0%
Canadian experience so what I did is I
 
05:14:04.510 --> 05:14:04.520 align:start position:0%
emailed you all uh about two hours ago I
 
05:14:06.510 --> 05:14:06.520 align:start position:0%
emailed you my testimony and in that
 
05:14:08.830 --> 05:14:08.840 align:start position:0%
testimony there are reference links to
 
05:14:11.390 --> 05:14:11.400 align:start position:0%
the data that I provided so you can
 
05:14:13.750 --> 05:14:13.760 align:start position:0%
click on all of those and and look at
 
05:14:14.948 --> 05:14:14.958 align:start position:0%
the reports that I looked at I'm glad
 
05:14:15.990 --> 05:14:16.000 align:start position:0%
you did that thank you thank you
 
05:14:19.548 --> 05:14:19.558 align:start position:0%
appreciate it for other
 
05:14:21.910 --> 05:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
questions saying none thank you for your
 
05:14:27.110 --> 05:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
testimony next is John Brun CL frosi
 
05:14:29.030 --> 05:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
from the Bedford Police from the New
 
05:14:32.030 --> 05:14:32.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Chiefs of Police Association
 
05:14:42.788 --> 05:14:42.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:46.470 --> 05:14:46.480 align:start position:0%
Bill Good there we go okay um thank you
 
05:14:48.628 --> 05:14:48.638 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you for giving uh the
 
05:14:50.628 --> 05:14:50.638 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Association of chiefs of
 
05:14:52.948 --> 05:14:52.958 align:start position:0%
police the opportunity to speak before
 
05:14:56.510 --> 05:14:56.520 align:start position:0%
you I we emailed you the testimony and
 
05:14:59.548 --> 05:14:59.558 align:start position:0%
I'll just briefly discuss um the final
 
05:15:02.510 --> 05:15:02.520 align:start position:0%
section of that testimony with respect
 
05:15:06.150 --> 05:15:06.160 align:start position:0%
to the costs that we estimate will be uh
 
05:15:08.548 --> 05:15:08.558 align:start position:0%
incurred if commercialization of
 
05:15:11.310 --> 05:15:11.320 align:start position:0%
cannabis is approved in the state of New
 
05:15:14.750 --> 05:15:14.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire based on the estimate which is
 
05:15:17.708 --> 05:15:17.718 align:start position:0%
again based on open-source data
 
05:15:19.990 --> 05:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
regarding the cost of substance use
 
05:15:22.910 --> 05:15:22.920 align:start position:0%
disorder both tangible and intangible
 
05:15:26.470 --> 05:15:26.480 align:start position:0%
costs in the United States we find that
 
05:15:28.868 --> 05:15:28.878 align:start position:0%
we expect that the state of New
 
05:15:31.830 --> 05:15:31.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire will incur an increase of of
 
05:15:35.030 --> 05:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
approximately $88 million in both
 
05:15:38.670 --> 05:15:38.680 align:start position:0%
tangible and intangible costs related to
 
05:15:41.190 --> 05:15:41.200 align:start position:0%
the legalization the commercialization
 
05:15:41.200 --> 05:15:42.270 align:start position:0%
the legalization the commercialization
of

05:15:42.270 --> 05:15:42.280 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:15:45.270 --> 05:15:45.280 align:start position:0%
cannabis uh in uh the state of New
 
05:15:47.788 --> 05:15:47.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire now again you just her
 
05:15:50.628 --> 05:15:50.638 align:start position:0%
testimony with respect to the Canadian
 
05:15:53.510 --> 05:15:53.520 align:start position:0%
experience both in Ontario and Quebec
 
05:15:56.270 --> 05:15:56.280 align:start position:0%
which I think are uh very much on point
 
05:15:58.430 --> 05:15:58.440 align:start position:0%
with respect to a discussion regarding
 
05:16:02.070 --> 05:16:02.080 align:start position:0%
the revenue and costs related to the uh
 
05:16:05.590 --> 05:16:05.600 align:start position:0%
commercialization of cannabis in Canada
 
05:16:07.430 --> 05:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
the study and the information that the
 
05:16:10.948 --> 05:16:10.958 align:start position:0%
Chiefs Association produced also relies
 
05:16:12.868 --> 05:16:12.878 align:start position:0%
on the Canadian experience which
 
05:16:15.670 --> 05:16:15.680 align:start position:0%
arguably probably has produced the best
 
05:16:19.708 --> 05:16:19.718 align:start position:0%
data uh that um we can use in
 
05:16:22.548 --> 05:16:22.558 align:start position:0%
extrapolating what would likely to occur
 
05:16:24.310 --> 05:16:24.320 align:start position:0%
here in the United States and in the
 
05:16:28.670 --> 05:16:28.680 align:start position:0%
granite state the Canadian government um
 
05:16:32.310 --> 05:16:32.320 align:start position:0%
has calculated that approximately 7%
 
05:16:34.708 --> 05:16:34.718 align:start position:0%
um of all the substance use disorder
 
05:16:38.150 --> 05:16:38.160 align:start position:0%
cost related to uh the use of cannabis
 
05:16:42.548 --> 05:16:42.558 align:start position:0%
uh in Canada um which equates to the $88
 
05:16:45.510 --> 05:16:45.520 align:start position:0%
million based on the total cost of
 
05:16:48.708 --> 05:16:48.718 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder um cost uh in the
 
05:16:51.868 --> 05:16:51.878 align:start position:0%
United States that's extrapolated down
 
05:16:53.990 --> 05:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
um here to the state of New Hampshire so
 
05:16:56.548 --> 05:16:56.558 align:start position:0%
that's where uh in general and again the
 
05:16:58.670 --> 05:16:58.680 align:start position:0%
data and the reference point and and
 
05:17:00.708 --> 05:17:00.718 align:start position:0%
it's footnoted uh in the testimony that
 
05:17:01.990 --> 05:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
was sent to you
 
05:17:03.830 --> 05:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
we also looked at material and
 
05:17:05.868 --> 05:17:05.878 align:start position:0%
information from the Journal of American
 
05:17:09.590 --> 05:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
Medical Association who has calculated a
 
05:17:12.190 --> 05:17:12.200 align:start position:0%
um the cost of cannabis as well as other
 
05:17:15.190 --> 05:17:15.200 align:start position:0%
drugs in terms of total Hospital costs
 
05:17:18.670 --> 05:17:18.680 align:start position:0%
looking at projected increase which
 
05:17:20.590 --> 05:17:20.600 align:start position:0%
again varies between 8 and
 
05:17:23.548 --> 05:17:23.558 align:start position:0%
12% uh if uh commercialization is
 
05:17:26.470 --> 05:17:26.480 align:start position:0%
approved in uh the granite state we're
 
05:17:28.948 --> 05:17:28.958 align:start position:0%
looking at somewhere in the vicinity of
 
05:17:33.230 --> 05:17:33.240 align:start position:0%
approximately 170,000 to $ 200,000 um
 
05:17:35.830 --> 05:17:35.840 align:start position:0%
dollars of an increase just that will be
 
05:17:39.350 --> 05:17:39.360 align:start position:0%
borne by uh New Hampshire hospitals
 
05:17:42.150 --> 05:17:42.160 align:start position:0%
treating both inpatient and outpatient
 
05:17:44.910 --> 05:17:44.920 align:start position:0%
cannabis related emergency department
 
05:17:48.990 --> 05:17:49.000 align:start position:0%
visits when we look at the potential
 
05:17:53.230 --> 05:17:53.240 align:start position:0%
impact on our roads we see that in
 
05:17:58.788 --> 05:17:58.798 align:start position:0%
2021 we had 116 fatal crashes uh here in
 
05:18:01.830 --> 05:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
uh the granite state using that data and
 
05:18:06.070 --> 05:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
using uh National Data that shows um
 
05:18:09.788 --> 05:18:09.798 align:start position:0%
approximately 4.7% of operators uh have
 
05:18:12.190 --> 05:18:12.200 align:start position:0%
admitted to operating while under while
 
05:18:14.510 --> 05:18:14.520 align:start position:0%
impaired by cannabis in the United
 
05:18:16.868 --> 05:18:16.878 align:start position:0%
States that's uh equates to somewhere
 
05:18:19.548 --> 05:18:19.558 align:start position:0%
between 51 and
 
05:18:21.990 --> 05:18:22.000 align:start position:0%
65,000 operators based on the total
 
05:18:24.390 --> 05:18:24.400 align:start position:0%
number of operators licensed uh in the
 
05:18:27.190 --> 05:18:27.200 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire using a a figure
 
05:18:29.030 --> 05:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
of approximately
 
05:18:32.230 --> 05:18:32.240 align:start position:0%
22% of all the fatal crashes which uh by
 
05:18:35.110 --> 05:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
the way based on the National Highway uh
 
05:18:37.628 --> 05:18:37.638 align:start position:0%
traffic safety administration numbers is
 
05:18:39.910 --> 05:18:39.920 align:start position:0%
quite low perhaps 50% lower than what it
 
05:18:43.830 --> 05:18:43.840 align:start position:0%
should be using a a 22% figure that
 
05:18:46.708 --> 05:18:46.718 align:start position:0%
equates to around 25 crashes directly
 
05:18:50.510 --> 05:18:50.520 align:start position:0%
related to cannabis if we look at a 12%
 
05:18:52.990 --> 05:18:53.000 align:start position:0%
increase uh that will lead us to
 
05:18:54.430 --> 05:18:54.440 align:start position:0%
somewhere in the vicinity of an
 
05:18:58.230 --> 05:18:58.240 align:start position:0%
additional 55 crashes uh per year that
 
05:19:01.430 --> 05:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
are caused as a direct result of
 
05:19:03.708 --> 05:19:03.718 align:start position:0%
commercialization of cannabis that leads
 
05:19:05.868 --> 05:19:05.878 align:start position:0%
us to an additional
 
05:19:08.708 --> 05:19:08.718 align:start position:0%
$230,000 in costs born by New Hampshire
 
05:19:11.470 --> 05:19:11.480 align:start position:0%
law enforcement uh municipalities like
 
05:19:14.190 --> 05:19:14.200 align:start position:0%
my department based on a calculation of
 
05:19:17.470 --> 05:19:17.480 align:start position:0%
the total cost of investigating a one
 
05:19:19.750 --> 05:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
car fatal motor vehicle accident at
 
05:19:23.390 --> 05:19:23.400 align:start position:0%
around $110,000 so that number is is is
 
05:19:25.548 --> 05:19:25.558 align:start position:0%
very conservative when we look at the
 
05:19:27.910 --> 05:19:27.920 align:start position:0%
total cost and so we're looking at
 
05:19:29.868 --> 05:19:29.878 align:start position:0%
somewhere in the vicinity of an increase
 
05:19:33.590 --> 05:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
of approximately 1 half million of cost
 
05:19:36.070 --> 05:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
by uh New Hampshire and law enforcement
 
05:19:38.628 --> 05:19:38.638 align:start position:0%
organizations uh and agencies to
 
05:19:41.750 --> 05:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
investigate um cannabis related motor
 
05:19:43.708 --> 05:19:43.718 align:start position:0%
vehicle fatal crash these are just fatal
 
05:19:45.270 --> 05:19:45.280 align:start position:0%
crashes by the way these are not just
 
05:19:45.280 --> 05:19:46.430 align:start position:0%
crashes by the way these are not just
all

05:19:46.430 --> 05:19:46.440 align:start position:0%
all
 
05:19:50.510 --> 05:19:50.520 align:start position:0%
crashes uh in in addition um when we
 
05:19:53.750 --> 05:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
look at the cost of investigating
 
05:19:57.270 --> 05:19:57.280 align:start position:0%
allegations of illicit uh manufacturer
 
05:20:00.510 --> 05:20:00.520 align:start position:0%
growing uh in distribution which I must
 
05:20:03.670 --> 05:20:03.680 align:start position:0%
say uh is a critical piece in your
 
05:20:06.788 --> 05:20:06.798 align:start position:0%
determination as to how much revenue
 
05:20:09.470 --> 05:20:09.480 align:start position:0%
this particular bill is expected to
 
05:20:11.830 --> 05:20:11.840 align:start position:0%
produce for the State of New Hampshire
 
05:20:14.510 --> 05:20:14.520 align:start position:0%
because the experience in most other
 
05:20:17.150 --> 05:20:17.160 align:start position:0%
states throughout the country is that
 
05:20:19.350 --> 05:20:19.360 align:start position:0%
the in including Canada by the way as
 
05:20:21.868 --> 05:20:21.878 align:start position:0%
you just heard from the previous uh
 
05:20:25.470 --> 05:20:25.480 align:start position:0%
speaker uh has continued to proliferate
 
05:20:27.788 --> 05:20:27.798 align:start position:0%
uh legalization commercialization of
 
05:20:32.590 --> 05:20:32.600 align:start position:0%
cannabis has not uh pushed the Market uh
 
05:20:35.830 --> 05:20:35.840 align:start position:0%
into Oblivion in fact in Most states it
 
05:20:39.150 --> 05:20:39.160 align:start position:0%
expanded exponentially uh and as a
 
05:20:42.270 --> 05:20:42.280 align:start position:0%
result uh commercialization has
 
05:20:44.750 --> 05:20:44.760 align:start position:0%
essentially turned law enforcement into
 
05:20:48.190 --> 05:20:48.200 align:start position:0%
21st century revenues because we are now
 
05:20:50.708 --> 05:20:50.718 align:start position:0%
or would be charged with investigating
 
05:20:52.750 --> 05:20:52.760 align:start position:0%
illicit grow and Manufacturing and
 
05:20:54.948 --> 05:20:54.958 align:start position:0%
distribution operations that are in
 
05:20:58.628 --> 05:20:58.638 align:start position:0%
direct competition uh with the state and
 
05:21:01.708 --> 05:21:01.718 align:start position:0%
we estimate conservatively the cost to
 
05:21:03.430 --> 05:21:03.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire municipalities
 
05:21:04.788 --> 05:21:04.798 align:start position:0%
particularly the law enforcement
 
05:21:07.030 --> 05:21:07.040 align:start position:0%
organizations somewhere between 2
 
05:21:10.190 --> 05:21:10.200 align:start position:0%
million and $2.5 million which if you
 
05:21:12.470 --> 05:21:12.480 align:start position:0%
look at the money that the legislature
 
05:21:15.390 --> 05:21:15.400 align:start position:0%
has uh allocated in previous years for
 
05:21:17.868 --> 05:21:17.878 align:start position:0%
just Granite hammer and granite Shield
 
05:21:21.350 --> 05:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
um that's a relatively uh short sum so
 
05:21:24.788 --> 05:21:24.798 align:start position:0%
in looking at the costs um involved um
 
05:21:27.190 --> 05:21:27.200 align:start position:0%
in in relation to the commercialization
 
05:21:29.590 --> 05:21:29.600 align:start position:0%
particularly the cost uh that would be
 
05:21:31.470 --> 05:21:31.480 align:start position:0%
imposed upon New Hampshire law
 
05:21:33.948 --> 05:21:33.958 align:start position:0%
enforcement um as you all know and I'm
 
05:21:35.350 --> 05:21:35.360 align:start position:0%
sure if you're talking to your own
 
05:21:37.708 --> 05:21:37.718 align:start position:0%
Chiefs uh they will tell you that each
 
05:21:39.830 --> 05:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
and every uh New Hampshire and law
 
05:21:41.590 --> 05:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
enforcement organization including the
 
05:21:43.910 --> 05:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
state police uh and County Sheriff's
 
05:21:46.990 --> 05:21:47.000 align:start position:0%
Office are wildly under resource um we
 
05:21:49.628 --> 05:21:49.638 align:start position:0%
are underst staffed uh and this
 
05:21:51.788 --> 05:21:51.798 align:start position:0%
imposition and the increase that we
 
05:21:54.750 --> 05:21:54.760 align:start position:0%
anticipate conservatively conservatively
 
05:21:57.390 --> 05:21:57.400 align:start position:0%
estimate um would not be able to be
 
05:22:00.110 --> 05:22:00.120 align:start position:0%
borne well if at all by New Hampshire
 
05:22:03.350 --> 05:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
and law enforcement so um I urge you to
 
05:22:06.990 --> 05:22:07.000 align:start position:0%
take a strong look at um the uh cost
 
05:22:10.750 --> 05:22:10.760 align:start position:0%
involved in uh approving this bill uh
 
05:22:12.990 --> 05:22:13.000 align:start position:0%
because that is essentially what we're
 
05:22:16.390 --> 05:22:16.400 align:start position:0%
facing and I think that ultimately uh
 
05:22:19.110 --> 05:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
using uh and again the representative on
 
05:22:20.670 --> 05:22:20.680 align:start position:0%
sponsored this bill is a good friend of
 
05:22:22.948 --> 05:22:22.958 align:start position:0%
law enforcement but I think that the
 
05:22:24.350 --> 05:22:24.360 align:start position:0%
estimates for
 
05:22:27.548 --> 05:22:27.558 align:start position:0%
Revenue uh discounting the cost of
 
05:22:31.270 --> 05:22:31.280 align:start position:0%
Regulation um legal regulation of it is
 
05:22:33.310 --> 05:22:33.320 align:start position:0%
a is akin to an episode in the Shark
 
05:22:34.590 --> 05:22:34.600 align:start position:0%
Tank I think that's what we're looking
 
05:22:36.708 --> 05:22:36.718 align:start position:0%
at here thank you for the opportunity to
 
05:22:38.030 --> 05:22:38.040 align:start position:0%
speak to you
 
05:22:41.030 --> 05:22:41.040 align:start position:0%
today thank you for your testimony Chief
 
05:22:43.948 --> 05:22:43.958 align:start position:0%
uh would you take questions
 
05:22:46.190 --> 05:22:46.200 align:start position:0%
yes representa
 
05:22:50.548 --> 05:22:50.558 align:start position:0%
Almy thank you uh it sounds like you're
 
05:22:53.990 --> 05:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
working from an estimate of how much the
 
05:22:56.830 --> 05:22:56.840 align:start position:0%
Cannabis Market would grow legal and
 
05:22:59.110 --> 05:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
illegal inside of New
 
05:23:02.590 --> 05:23:02.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh if it is legalized here but
 
05:23:05.030 --> 05:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
all of our neighbors have
 
05:23:10.070 --> 05:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
legalized and uh I'm pretty sure that
 
05:23:11.910 --> 05:23:11.920 align:start position:0%
we've got people going to the
 
05:23:15.910 --> 05:23:15.920 align:start position:0%
neighboring states to bring back legal
 
05:23:20.150 --> 05:23:20.160 align:start position:0%
marijuana in at least some cases on how
 
05:23:22.070 --> 05:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
did you decide how much you figured it
 
05:23:22.080 --> 05:23:22.830 align:start position:0%
did you decide how much you figured it
would

05:23:22.830 --> 05:23:22.840 align:start position:0%
would
 
05:23:26.470 --> 05:23:26.480 align:start position:0%
grow that's based on my experience as a
 
05:23:29.830 --> 05:23:29.840 align:start position:0%
law enforcement officer for 43 years and
 
05:23:33.070 --> 05:23:33.080 align:start position:0%
um particularly based Bas on my 27 years
 
05:23:34.990 --> 05:23:35.000 align:start position:0%
working uh with the Drug Enforcement
 
05:23:36.910 --> 05:23:36.920 align:start position:0%
Administration in various places
 
05:23:39.430 --> 05:23:39.440 align:start position:0%
throughout the country and uh my
 
05:23:41.310 --> 05:23:41.320 align:start position:0%
experience in dealing with the illicit
 
05:23:43.230 --> 05:23:43.240 align:start position:0%
market for controled substances
 
05:23:46.190 --> 05:23:46.200 align:start position:0%
including uh marijuana and I can tell
 
05:23:48.990 --> 05:23:49.000 align:start position:0%
you explicitly that the uh illicit
 
05:23:51.830 --> 05:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
Market uh doesn't go away precisely
 
05:23:54.430 --> 05:23:54.440 align:start position:0%
because they don't pay taxes they don't
 
05:23:57.788 --> 05:23:57.798 align:start position:0%
pay um Social Security they don't pay
 
05:24:00.868 --> 05:24:00.878 align:start position:0%
Medicare um they don't pay those costs
 
05:24:04.230 --> 05:24:04.240 align:start position:0%
uh and as a result uh cannabis and
 
05:24:07.708 --> 05:24:07.718 align:start position:0%
marijuana um on the black market is
 
05:24:11.670 --> 05:24:11.680 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily um uh um High Revenue
 
05:24:13.948 --> 05:24:13.958 align:start position:0%
producing in fact it produces more
 
05:24:16.670 --> 05:24:16.680 align:start position:0%
revenue on par than uh cocaine
 
05:24:20.150 --> 05:24:20.160 align:start position:0%
production does and in addition it's
 
05:24:23.510 --> 05:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
been our experience that uh ilic illicit
 
05:24:26.470 --> 05:24:26.480 align:start position:0%
producers generally uh produce somewhere
 
05:24:30.190 --> 05:24:30.200 align:start position:0%
in the vicinity of around 250 to 300%
 
05:24:32.628 --> 05:24:32.638 align:start position:0%
more than what the market demands so
 
05:24:36.390 --> 05:24:36.400 align:start position:0%
there's never a shortage of Supply so
 
05:24:39.390 --> 05:24:39.400 align:start position:0%
that number that I arrived in direct U
 
05:24:41.910 --> 05:24:41.920 align:start position:0%
relation to your question is as a very
 
05:24:45.670 --> 05:24:45.680 align:start position:0%
low estimate 100 investigations based on
 
05:24:48.150 --> 05:24:48.160 align:start position:0%
a general cost of experience based on
 
05:24:50.470 --> 05:24:50.480 align:start position:0%
the number of hours of surveillance uh
 
05:24:51.990 --> 05:24:52.000 align:start position:0%
and again it doesn't include the
 
05:24:54.470 --> 05:24:54.480 align:start position:0%
prosecution County attorney cost or the
 
05:24:56.510 --> 05:24:56.520 align:start position:0%
court cost none of these figures include
 
05:24:58.910 --> 05:24:58.920 align:start position:0%
court costs so 100 investigations
 
05:25:01.270 --> 05:25:01.280 align:start position:0%
throughout the grite state based on
 
05:25:04.030 --> 05:25:04.040 align:start position:0%
commercialization um relative to illicit
 
05:25:06.310 --> 05:25:06.320 align:start position:0%
grow operations is relatively small
 
05:25:09.670 --> 05:25:09.680 align:start position:0%
there's no data from uh Vermont Maine or
 
05:25:11.788 --> 05:25:11.798 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts reg relative to the
 
05:25:15.070 --> 05:25:15.080 align:start position:0%
numbers of um illicit um growing
 
05:25:16.830 --> 05:25:16.840 align:start position:0%
operations although there have been a
 
05:25:20.070 --> 05:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
number of them from what I understand
 
05:25:23.150 --> 05:25:23.160 align:start position:0%
anecdotally representative Murphy thank
 
05:25:24.708 --> 05:25:24.718 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you for your
 
05:25:27.670 --> 05:25:27.680 align:start position:0%
testimony and taking my question my my
 
05:25:29.910 --> 05:25:29.920 align:start position:0%
my question is maybe without a real
 
05:25:32.830 --> 05:25:32.840 align:start position:0%
answer uh um but I'd be interested in
 
05:25:35.628 --> 05:25:35.638 align:start position:0%
your thoughts about this my
 
05:25:38.270 --> 05:25:38.280 align:start position:0%
experience in hospitalization and care
 
05:25:40.708 --> 05:25:40.718 align:start position:0%
of patients is that the great majority
 
05:25:42.868 --> 05:25:42.878 align:start position:0%
of the accidents that we see are alcohol
 
05:25:45.510 --> 05:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
related uh some may have you know
 
05:25:47.430 --> 05:25:47.440 align:start position:0%
cannabis but I'm wondering if the
 
05:25:49.910 --> 05:25:49.920 align:start position:0%
numbers that you have when you address
 
05:25:52.150 --> 05:25:52.160 align:start position:0%
the increased cost of hospitalizations
 
05:25:54.948 --> 05:25:54.958 align:start position:0%
is as a result of an increased use now
 
05:25:56.830 --> 05:25:56.840 align:start position:0%
of cannabis versus those that would
 
05:25:59.510 --> 05:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
choose cannabis over alcohol and the
 
05:26:01.670 --> 05:26:01.680 align:start position:0%
consequences of their action
 
05:26:04.270 --> 05:26:04.280 align:start position:0%
um because if you do have and and I also
 
05:26:07.150 --> 05:26:07.160 align:start position:0%
ask because if you have cannabis
 
05:26:10.270 --> 05:26:10.280 align:start position:0%
regulated and without any uh poisoning
 
05:26:11.990 --> 05:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
so to speak with fentanyl or other
 
05:26:16.470 --> 05:26:16.480 align:start position:0%
illicit substances might the um rate of
 
05:26:18.390 --> 05:26:18.400 align:start position:0%
injuries and accidents go down as a
 
05:26:20.430 --> 05:26:20.440 align:start position:0%
result of that so I'm wondering if you
 
05:26:21.830 --> 05:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
have any sense about whether or not it's
 
05:26:25.628 --> 05:26:25.638 align:start position:0%
a net gain in cost for hospitalizations
 
05:26:28.910 --> 05:26:28.920 align:start position:0%
and care of these patients or um are the
 
05:26:30.350 --> 05:26:30.360 align:start position:0%
same people would choose one of the
 
05:26:32.750 --> 05:26:32.760 align:start position:0%
other and then get behind the wheel of a
 
05:26:35.910 --> 05:26:35.920 align:start position:0%
car the the data and the increase in the
 
05:26:38.548 --> 05:26:38.558 align:start position:0%
number of cannabis related crashes and
 
05:26:40.190 --> 05:26:40.200 align:start position:0%
these are again our fatal crashes and
 
05:26:42.750 --> 05:26:42.760 align:start position:0%
their resulting Hospital costs are based
 
05:26:45.030 --> 05:26:45.040 align:start position:0%
on a couple of assumptions um they're
 
05:26:47.190 --> 05:26:47.200 align:start position:0%
based on data provided by national
 
05:26:49.430 --> 05:26:49.440 align:start position:0%
highway traffic safety administration
 
05:26:53.350 --> 05:26:53.360 align:start position:0%
regarding the number of operators um who
 
05:26:55.910 --> 05:26:55.920 align:start position:0%
admit to driving um while under the
 
05:26:58.430 --> 05:26:58.440 align:start position:0%
influence of cannabis as well as data
 
05:27:00.548 --> 05:27:00.558 align:start position:0%
from states that have Comm
 
05:27:03.430 --> 05:27:03.440 align:start position:0%
commercialized cannabis and have seen um
 
05:27:06.788 --> 05:27:06.798 align:start position:0%
about 120% increase in the number of
 
05:27:10.030 --> 05:27:10.040 align:start position:0%
fatal crashes um the hospitalization
 
05:27:14.230 --> 05:27:14.240 align:start position:0%
cost is uh derived from uh an averaging
 
05:27:16.948 --> 05:27:16.958 align:start position:0%
if you will uh from the journal American
 
05:27:19.910 --> 05:27:19.920 align:start position:0%
Medical Association report in
 
05:27:22.708 --> 05:27:22.718 align:start position:0%
2019 that calculated the cost of both
 
05:27:26.150 --> 05:27:26.160 align:start position:0%
inpatient and outpatient uh marijuana uh
 
05:27:29.670 --> 05:27:29.680 align:start position:0%
Ed visits um the high end being 8,000
 
05:27:31.310 --> 05:27:31.320 align:start position:0%
the low end being about about 2,000
 
05:27:34.230 --> 05:27:34.240 align:start position:0%
using a $4,000 average that puts us at
 
05:27:34.240 --> 05:27:35.910 align:start position:0%
using a $4,000 average that puts us at
around

05:27:35.910 --> 05:27:35.920 align:start position:0%
around
 
05:27:39.150 --> 05:27:39.160 align:start position:0%
$165,000 uh increase just in
 
05:27:41.350 --> 05:27:41.360 align:start position:0%
hospitalization costs borne by the
 
05:27:44.670 --> 05:27:44.680 align:start position:0%
hospitals themselves so um in in every
 
05:27:47.030 --> 05:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
state that has commercialized Canabis
 
05:27:49.590 --> 05:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
there has been a complimentary increase
 
05:27:52.470 --> 05:27:52.480 align:start position:0%
in fatalities and crashes um
 
05:27:56.750 --> 05:27:56.760 align:start position:0%
attributable or or involved with drivers
 
05:27:58.310 --> 05:27:58.320 align:start position:0%
uh operating Under the Influence and of
 
05:28:00.670 --> 05:28:00.680 align:start position:0%
course here uh in the state of New
 
05:28:02.628 --> 05:28:02.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire ladies and gentlemen there is
 
05:28:06.430 --> 05:28:06.440 align:start position:0%
no per se limit uh for uh intoxication
 
05:28:09.830 --> 05:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
by THC and so it is absolutely
 
05:28:12.350 --> 05:28:12.360 align:start position:0%
impossible and I speak from experience
 
05:28:15.390 --> 05:28:15.400 align:start position:0%
having two fatal crashes in the town of
 
05:28:17.868 --> 05:28:17.878 align:start position:0%
Bedford New Hampshire uh both of which
 
05:28:20.190 --> 05:28:20.200 align:start position:0%
involved operators that were operating
 
05:28:23.430 --> 05:28:23.440 align:start position:0%
under impaired based on the toxicology
 
05:28:25.868 --> 05:28:25.878 align:start position:0%
reports but yet the county attorney's
 
05:28:29.150 --> 05:28:29.160 align:start position:0%
office was hamstrung uh in its inability
 
05:28:31.270 --> 05:28:31.280 align:start position:0%
to prosecute uh uh both of those
 
05:28:34.708 --> 05:28:34.718 align:start position:0%
operators who who killed two people and
 
05:28:36.430 --> 05:28:36.440 align:start position:0%
uh again while we're talking about
 
05:28:38.948 --> 05:28:38.958 align:start position:0%
dollars and cents I have to make sure I
 
05:28:42.430 --> 05:28:42.440 align:start position:0%
bring everyone back to faces of people
 
05:28:44.788 --> 05:28:44.798 align:start position:0%
we can't put dollars and cents above the
 
05:28:48.788 --> 05:28:48.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:52.830 --> 05:28:52.840 align:start position:0%
life represent Aaron thank you Mr chair
 
05:28:56.628 --> 05:28:56.638 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony today um
 
05:28:59.430 --> 05:28:59.440 align:start position:0%
and for taking my question so I'm
 
05:29:01.230 --> 05:29:01.240 align:start position:0%
interested to know
 
05:29:04.310 --> 05:29:04.320 align:start position:0%
if you've been in contact with other
 
05:29:07.350 --> 05:29:07.360 align:start position:0%
police Chiefs associations other police
 
05:29:09.628 --> 05:29:09.638 align:start position:0%
Chiefs in other states that have
 
05:29:14.548 --> 05:29:14.558 align:start position:0%
legalized um to see what their
 
05:29:17.990 --> 05:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
increased law enforcement costs are or
 
05:29:20.868 --> 05:29:20.878 align:start position:0%
have been since
 
05:29:22.910 --> 05:29:22.920 align:start position:0%
legalization I haven't personally had
 
05:29:26.310 --> 05:29:26.320 align:start position:0%
any contact we've uh talked uh certainly
 
05:29:29.070 --> 05:29:29.080 align:start position:0%
amongst uh our our colleagues here in
 
05:29:32.110 --> 05:29:32.120 align:start position:0%
the grand state with respect to our
 
05:29:34.830 --> 05:29:34.840 align:start position:0%
experience with uh our current
 
05:29:37.750 --> 05:29:37.760 align:start position:0%
experience with marijuana related uh
 
05:29:40.470 --> 05:29:40.480 align:start position:0%
crashes as well as fatalities the
 
05:29:43.350 --> 05:29:43.360 align:start position:0%
information that uh is uh contained in
 
05:29:46.270 --> 05:29:46.280 align:start position:0%
my testimony um and written testimony
 
05:29:49.030 --> 05:29:49.040 align:start position:0%
and and my spoken testimony today is is
 
05:29:52.310 --> 05:29:52.320 align:start position:0%
derived from uh open source material um
 
05:29:55.948 --> 05:29:55.958 align:start position:0%
Quebec um recently produced an article
 
05:29:59.070 --> 05:29:59.080 align:start position:0%
that showed the qpp the Quebec
 
05:30:00.788 --> 05:30:00.798 align:start position:0%
Provincial Police uh
 
05:30:03.030 --> 05:30:03.040 align:start position:0%
having experienced a substantial
 
05:30:06.430 --> 05:30:06.440 align:start position:0%
increase uh in operators impaired by
 
05:30:08.868 --> 05:30:08.878 align:start position:0%
cannabis after legalization there was a
 
05:30:11.270 --> 05:30:11.280 align:start position:0%
recent article that attributed a
 
05:30:13.590 --> 05:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
significant increase in the number of
 
05:30:15.390 --> 05:30:15.400 align:start position:0%
operators arrested in the state of
 
05:30:19.350 --> 05:30:19.360 align:start position:0%
Vermont uh our neighbor um related to
 
05:30:22.868 --> 05:30:22.878 align:start position:0%
DUI arrest um of operators under the
 
05:30:26.470 --> 05:30:26.480 align:start position:0%
influence of cannabis so um and again I
 
05:30:29.150 --> 05:30:29.160 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I don't know the answer as
 
05:30:31.310 --> 05:30:31.320 align:start position:0%
to whether or not either Quebec or
 
05:30:35.990 --> 05:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
Ontario have per se limits um and I know
 
05:30:37.390 --> 05:30:37.400 align:start position:0%
that a number of states that have
 
05:30:39.910 --> 05:30:39.920 align:start position:0%
commercialized have taken the step in
 
05:30:42.470 --> 05:30:42.480 align:start position:0%
advance of commercialization to enact
 
05:30:46.430 --> 05:30:46.440 align:start position:0%
laws that set very very low standard for
 
05:30:49.910 --> 05:30:49.920 align:start position:0%
uh intoxication by cannabis in an effort
 
05:30:53.030 --> 05:30:53.040 align:start position:0%
to ensure that um the to ensure the
 
05:30:55.310 --> 05:30:55.320 align:start position:0%
safety of the roads and highways and the
 
05:30:58.830 --> 05:30:58.840 align:start position:0%
ability to create an incentive for
 
05:31:00.990 --> 05:31:01.000 align:start position:0%
operators in those States to not drive
 
05:31:05.110 --> 05:31:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:09.470 --> 05:31:09.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:09.480 --> 05:31:11.030 align:start position:0%
 
questions

05:31:11.030 --> 05:31:11.040 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:31:13.070 --> 05:31:13.080 align:start position:0%
represent thank you Mr chairman thank
 
05:31:14.830 --> 05:31:14.840 align:start position:0%
you Chief uh for taking my question and
 
05:31:16.910 --> 05:31:16.920 align:start position:0%
for your service I do have one question
 
05:31:18.708 --> 05:31:18.718 align:start position:0%
about something you said and I it made
 
05:31:21.150 --> 05:31:21.160 align:start position:0%
me scratch my head and you were talking
 
05:31:24.270 --> 05:31:24.280 align:start position:0%
about the increased costs in law
 
05:31:26.948 --> 05:31:26.958 align:start position:0%
enforcement in court for for the
 
05:31:29.350 --> 05:31:29.360 align:start position:0%
investigation arrest prosecution and
 
05:31:32.190 --> 05:31:32.200 align:start position:0%
Court time for illegal grow
 
05:31:34.230 --> 05:31:34.240 align:start position:0%
operations and I guess I was confused
 
05:31:35.310 --> 05:31:35.320 align:start position:0%
that because right now any grow
 
05:31:36.750 --> 05:31:36.760 align:start position:0%
operation is illegal in the state of New
 
05:31:38.750 --> 05:31:38.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire except for the situation so
 
05:31:40.390 --> 05:31:40.400 align:start position:0%
I'm not understand how that changes what
 
05:31:42.590 --> 05:31:42.600 align:start position:0%
your cost is and how that adds an
 
05:31:45.230 --> 05:31:45.240 align:start position:0%
expense to law enforcement because in
 
05:31:46.628 --> 05:31:46.638 align:start position:0%
theory you're already investigating
 
05:31:48.350 --> 05:31:48.360 align:start position:0%
those things and Prosecuting those
 
05:31:50.430 --> 05:31:50.440 align:start position:0%
things sure thank you for your question
 
05:31:53.590 --> 05:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
yeah that's predicated on the assumption
 
05:31:55.430 --> 05:31:55.440 align:start position:0%
that uh once
 
05:31:57.868 --> 05:31:57.878 align:start position:0%
commercialized that law enforcement's
 
05:32:00.628 --> 05:32:00.638 align:start position:0%
Focus uh will be diverted
 
05:32:04.230 --> 05:32:04.240 align:start position:0%
uh to other areas and means and that the
 
05:32:07.990 --> 05:32:08.000 align:start position:0%
bar for conducting such investigations
 
05:32:10.150 --> 05:32:10.160 align:start position:0%
uh involving cannabis which has already
 
05:32:12.110 --> 05:32:12.120 align:start position:0%
been raised since we
 
05:32:14.708 --> 05:32:14.718 align:start position:0%
decriminalized uh uh smaller quantities
 
05:32:17.470 --> 05:32:17.480 align:start position:0%
of cannabis in New Hampshire uh
 
05:32:21.030 --> 05:32:21.040 align:start position:0%
increases so as a result the illicit
 
05:32:23.788 --> 05:32:23.798 align:start position:0%
marketeers will exploit the fact that
 
05:32:26.350 --> 05:32:26.360 align:start position:0%
it's been commercialized and take an
 
05:32:29.670 --> 05:32:29.680 align:start position:0%
opportunity to Edge out the legal Market
 
05:32:31.910 --> 05:32:31.920 align:start position:0%
by being being able to produce uh
 
05:32:35.708 --> 05:32:35.718 align:start position:0%
illicit marijuana at a much lower cost
 
05:32:37.990 --> 05:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
um at just as good a quality if not
 
05:32:40.230 --> 05:32:40.240 align:start position:0%
better than what the state can sell at
 
05:32:42.750 --> 05:32:42.760 align:start position:0%
at a much lower price so in other states
 
05:32:45.910 --> 05:32:45.920 align:start position:0%
and other areas it's a simple economic
 
05:32:49.510 --> 05:32:49.520 align:start position:0%
equation supply and demand and cost uh
 
05:32:52.230 --> 05:32:52.240 align:start position:0%
and we anticipate a significant increase
 
05:32:54.310 --> 05:32:54.320 align:start position:0%
in illicit grow operations if
 
05:32:57.788 --> 05:32:57.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:00.830 --> 05:33:00.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire also yeah I'm not sure that
 
05:33:02.350 --> 05:33:02.360 align:start position:0%
answers my question but
 
05:33:06.150 --> 05:33:06.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:09.150 --> 05:33:09.160 align:start position:0%

employees um Mr chair we're here today
 
05:34:29.310 --> 05:34:29.320 align:start position:0%
because um we are neutral on the policy
 
05:34:30.948 --> 05:34:30.958 align:start position:0%
of weather or not cannabis should be
 
05:34:33.750 --> 05:34:33.760 align:start position:0%
legal but we strongly are opposed to the
 
05:34:36.230 --> 05:34:36.240 align:start position:0%
State Bank portion of the legislation
 
05:34:38.390 --> 05:34:38.400 align:start position:0%
which um is in section five starting on
 
05:34:41.310 --> 05:34:41.320 align:start position:0%
pages 9 through 11 um Mr chair I
 
05:34:43.230 --> 05:34:43.240 align:start position:0%
understand you'd like um testimony focus
 
05:34:45.270 --> 05:34:45.280 align:start position:0%
on Revenue we've not yet had the

opportunity to speak on the public bank
 
05:34:49.590 --> 05:34:49.600 align:start position:0%
is that permissible or should I focus on
 
05:34:50.628 --> 05:34:50.638 align:start position:0%
the revenue
 
05:34:53.750 --> 05:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
sections since banking is a good is a
 
05:34:56.750 --> 05:34:56.760 align:start position:0%
big part of this both okay thank you Mr
 
05:34:59.390 --> 05:34:59.400 align:start position:0%
chair I appreciate that um we are
 
05:35:01.548 --> 05:35:01.558 align:start position:0%
opposed to the State Bank proposal um
 
05:35:03.430 --> 05:35:03.440 align:start position:0%
for several reasons um first off I'd
 
05:35:05.430 --> 05:35:05.440 align:start position:0%
just like to say that we do not believe
 
05:35:08.670 --> 05:35:08.680 align:start position:0%
a state bank is needed um we I listen to
 
05:35:10.390 --> 05:35:10.400 align:start position:0%
the sponsor today and I understand that
 
05:35:12.628 --> 05:35:12.638 align:start position:0%
this language is intended to be a back
 
05:35:14.948 --> 05:35:14.958 align:start position:0%
stop to ensure that banking services are
 
05:35:17.470 --> 05:35:17.480 align:start position:0%
available in the event that financial
 
05:35:19.670 --> 05:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
services are not found in the private
 
05:35:22.670 --> 05:35:22.680 align:start position:0%
sector we do understand the perception
 
05:35:24.708 --> 05:35:24.718 align:start position:0%
that Banks do not Bank cannabis due to
 
05:35:27.788 --> 05:35:27.798 align:start position:0%
the federal prohibition um however
 
05:35:29.750 --> 05:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
finsen the financial crimes and
 
05:35:32.190 --> 05:35:32.200 align:start position:0%
enforcement Network they have issued
 
05:35:34.708 --> 05:35:34.718 align:start position:0%
guidance for financial institutions
 
05:35:37.150 --> 05:35:37.160 align:start position:0%
seeking to provide services to marijana
 
05:35:39.670 --> 05:35:39.680 align:start position:0%
related businesses which outlines a path
 
05:35:42.390 --> 05:35:42.400 align:start position:0%
to do so um and I I do have copies of my
 
05:35:44.750 --> 05:35:44.760 align:start position:0%
testimony that I provided to Jennifer um
 
05:35:46.350 --> 05:35:46.360 align:start position:0%
and in that I can email it if it's
 
05:35:48.910 --> 05:35:48.920 align:start position:0%
easier there is a link to that finsen
 
05:35:51.110 --> 05:35:51.120 align:start position:0%
guidance right on your testimony if you
 
05:35:53.910 --> 05:35:53.920 align:start position:0%
summarize it we have copies of it okay
 
05:35:56.270 --> 05:35:56.280 align:start position:0%
very good um so one of the other points
 
05:35:57.948 --> 05:35:57.958 align:start position:0%
I wanted to mention as to why we don't
 
05:35:59.948 --> 05:35:59.958 align:start position:0%
think a state bank is needed um I've
 
05:36:01.708 --> 05:36:01.718 align:start position:0%
also included with my testimony you'll
 
05:36:04.868 --> 05:36:04.878 align:start position:0%
see a chart by finen um that shows that
 
05:36:06.788 --> 05:36:06.798 align:start position:0%
there are over 600 Banks and Credit
 
05:36:09.030 --> 05:36:09.040 align:start position:0%
Unions that are in this space around the
 
05:36:12.590 --> 05:36:12.600 align:start position:0%
country um and you can look at that so I
 
05:36:15.430 --> 05:36:15.440 align:start position:0%
want to make a very important Point um
 
05:36:17.990 --> 05:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
we read the legislation to mean that as
 
05:36:19.868 --> 05:36:19.878 align:start position:0%
it's drafted the state of New Hampshire
 
05:36:23.150 --> 05:36:23.160 align:start position:0%
would be the customer um in in un with
 
05:36:25.230 --> 05:36:25.240 align:start position:0%
that understanding and discussions with
 
05:36:27.868 --> 05:36:27.878 align:start position:0%
our members um if this legislation is
 
05:36:31.070 --> 05:36:31.080 align:start position:0%
passed the state can expect to Access
 
05:36:33.868 --> 05:36:33.878 align:start position:0%
Financial Services from banks in New
 
05:36:35.868 --> 05:36:35.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so we don't believe a state
 
05:36:39.150 --> 05:36:39.160 align:start position:0%
bank is necessary for that reason um I'd
 
05:36:41.070 --> 05:36:41.080 align:start position:0%
also like to just point out quickly that
 
05:36:43.190 --> 05:36:43.200 align:start position:0%
we believe a state bank is Not Practical
 
05:36:44.548 --> 05:36:44.558 align:start position:0%
and there are a lot of logistical
 
05:36:47.150 --> 05:36:47.160 align:start position:0%
challenges to making this work um the
 
05:36:50.310 --> 05:36:50.320 align:start position:0%
state of California they in 2018 they
 
05:36:52.270 --> 05:36:52.280 align:start position:0%
completed a study I've also given that
 
05:36:54.070 --> 05:36:54.080 align:start position:0%
study to um Jennifer's available if you
 
05:36:56.430 --> 05:36:56.440 align:start position:0%
all would like that um and in their
 
05:36:59.070 --> 05:36:59.080 align:start position:0%
study they reached the conclusion that a
 
05:37:01.708 --> 05:37:01.718 align:start position:0%
public Bank is not feasible and would
 
05:37:03.750 --> 05:37:03.760 align:start position:0%
Inc I'm sorry is not feasible and would
 
05:37:05.948 --> 05:37:05.958 align:start position:0%
unavoidably incur a high risk of
 
05:37:08.230 --> 05:37:08.240 align:start position:0%
criminal penalties and face other legal
 
05:37:11.190 --> 05:37:11.200 align:start position:0%
impediments that cannot be eliminated um
 
05:37:13.190 --> 05:37:13.200 align:start position:0%
I'd like to point out that in California
 
05:37:15.750 --> 05:37:15.760 align:start position:0%
they looked at all types of public Banks
 
05:37:18.110 --> 05:37:18.120 align:start position:0%
they looked at Credit Unions they looked
 
05:37:20.750 --> 05:37:20.760 align:start position:0%
at um cannabis Banks only they looked at
 
05:37:22.830 --> 05:37:22.840 align:start position:0%
cannabis Plus banking they looked at
 
05:37:25.270 --> 05:37:25.280 align:start position:0%
fintech Solutions and in all of their
 
05:37:27.230 --> 05:37:27.240 align:start position:0%
research They concluded that a public
 
05:37:28.590 --> 05:37:28.600 align:start position:0%
Bank was not
 
05:37:28.600 --> 05:37:30.708 align:start position:0%
Bank was not
feasible

05:37:30.708 --> 05:37:30.718 align:start position:0%
feasible
 
05:37:34.430 --> 05:37:34.440 align:start position:0%
um moving on so since uh so I wanted to
 
05:37:37.830 --> 05:37:37.840 align:start position:0%
talk about why I why a State Bank um has
 
05:37:39.350 --> 05:37:39.360 align:start position:0%
logistical challenges and there are two
 
05:37:41.750 --> 05:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
really key points um because the
 
05:37:43.788 --> 05:37:43.798 align:start position:0%
revenues will be derived only from
 
05:37:46.470 --> 05:37:46.480 align:start position:0%
Cannabis the lack of diversification
 
05:37:49.390 --> 05:37:49.400 align:start position:0%
ends up with a high concentration risk
 
05:37:51.310 --> 05:37:51.320 align:start position:0%
based on the California study they have
 
05:37:53.830 --> 05:37:53.840 align:start position:0%
two very important points as a result of
 
05:37:56.270 --> 05:37:56.280 align:start position:0%
that high concentration risk first a
 
05:37:58.070 --> 05:37:58.080 align:start position:0%
state bank will likely not be able to
 
05:38:00.510 --> 05:38:00.520 align:start position:0%
get FDIC insurance
 
05:38:03.110 --> 05:38:03.120 align:start position:0%
um currently for if you're a bank and
 
05:38:04.430 --> 05:38:04.440 align:start position:0%
you would like to have a New Hampshire
 
05:38:06.750 --> 05:38:06.760 align:start position:0%
Charter the banking department has to um
 
05:38:10.390 --> 05:38:10.400 align:start position:0%
they require FDIC Insurance second um
 
05:38:11.670 --> 05:38:11.680 align:start position:0%
another big point which I think was
 
05:38:12.948 --> 05:38:12.958 align:start position:0%
referenced in some of the questions
 
05:38:15.590 --> 05:38:15.600 align:start position:0%
today is um we believe that they would
 
05:38:18.150 --> 05:38:18.160 align:start position:0%
not be eligible for a master account
 
05:38:20.310 --> 05:38:20.320 align:start position:0%
with the Federal Reserve um for those of
 
05:38:22.910 --> 05:38:22.920 align:start position:0%
you that are not aware of who may not be
 
05:38:25.230 --> 05:38:25.240 align:start position:0%
familiar with that a master account with
 
05:38:27.470 --> 05:38:27.480 align:start position:0%
a Fed Reserve is is required for the
 
05:38:29.590 --> 05:38:29.600 align:start position:0%
day-to-day business of banking and it's
 
05:38:33.110 --> 05:38:33.120 align:start position:0%
really crucial um and I do I know Mr
 
05:38:35.150 --> 05:38:35.160 align:start position:0%
chair you've asked me to just be brief
 
05:38:37.468 --> 05:38:37.478 align:start position:0%
um I do want to share a quote from the
 
05:38:39.910 --> 05:38:39.920 align:start position:0%
study which I think really underscores
 
05:38:42.350 --> 05:38:42.360 align:start position:0%
the importance of this point um so from
 
05:38:45.110 --> 05:38:45.120 align:start position:0%
the study it reads um to be clear
 
05:38:46.990 --> 05:38:47.000 align:start position:0%
without a master account issued by the
 
05:38:49.830 --> 05:38:49.840 align:start position:0%
Federal Reserve the bank cannot function
 
05:38:52.030 --> 05:38:52.040 align:start position:0%
it would have no ability to issue checks
 
05:38:54.548 --> 05:38:54.558 align:start position:0%
or otherwise make payments other than in
 
05:38:56.750 --> 05:38:56.760 align:start position:0%
cash and no ability to transfer funds to
 
05:38:58.868 --> 05:38:58.878 align:start position:0%
other banks in short it would be in the
 
05:39:01.070 --> 05:39:01.080 align:start position:0%
same predic ment currently faced by the
 
05:39:03.030 --> 05:39:03.040 align:start position:0%
Cannabis businesses that it's supposed
 
05:39:05.510 --> 05:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
to help the public bank would be a
 
05:39:07.468 --> 05:39:07.478 align:start position:0%
network of cash vaults that would
 
05:39:09.190 --> 05:39:09.200 align:start position:0%
provide customers with the ability to
 
05:39:11.390 --> 05:39:11.400 align:start position:0%
transact businesses only with other
 
05:39:13.628 --> 05:39:13.638 align:start position:0%
customers of the bank with no ability to
 
05:39:15.510 --> 05:39:15.520 align:start position:0%
transact business outside of the public
 
05:39:17.590 --> 05:39:17.600 align:start position:0%
Bank Network the public bank would be
 
05:39:19.990 --> 05:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
holding large sums of cash that cannot
 
05:39:22.910 --> 05:39:22.920 align:start position:0%
be invested or loaned without great risk
 
05:39:25.230 --> 05:39:25.240 align:start position:0%
all subject to seizure by the federal
 
05:39:27.430 --> 05:39:27.440 align:start position:0%
government um I really can't articulate
 
05:39:30.430 --> 05:39:30.440 align:start position:0%
it any better than they did and so um
 
05:39:33.548 --> 05:39:33.558 align:start position:0%
just another point I'd like to add is my
 
05:39:35.270 --> 05:39:35.280 align:start position:0%
understanding is this would be one
 
05:39:38.110 --> 05:39:38.120 align:start position:0%
physical bank and um in discussions with
 
05:39:40.310 --> 05:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
our members we they believe that this
 
05:39:43.110 --> 05:39:43.120 align:start position:0%
really is going to require additional
 
05:39:45.390 --> 05:39:45.400 align:start position:0%
infrastructure um meaning additional
 
05:39:47.590 --> 05:39:47.600 align:start position:0%
branches and cash Services throughout
 
05:39:47.600 --> 05:39:48.628 align:start position:0%
branches and cash Services throughout
the

05:39:48.628 --> 05:39:48.638 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:39:50.948 --> 05:39:50.958 align:start position:0%
state um getting to the financial
 
05:39:54.070 --> 05:39:54.080 align:start position:0%
picture of a State Bank um the bill
 
05:39:56.190 --> 05:39:56.200 align:start position:0%
provides 10 million in capital to start
 
05:39:59.628 --> 05:39:59.638 align:start position:0%
it and I it's not clear to me but in the
 
05:40:02.510 --> 05:40:02.520 align:start position:0%
fiscal note that I saw dated I think 12
 
05:40:05.310 --> 05:40:05.320 align:start position:0%
1321 um I did not see a reference to the
 
05:40:08.948 --> 05:40:08.958 align:start position:0%
$10 million in capital for um to start
 
05:40:11.548 --> 05:40:11.558 align:start position:0%
up the bank and I'm not sure in if in
 
05:40:14.110 --> 05:40:14.120 align:start position:0%
the sponsors estimates if that 14
 
05:40:15.830 --> 05:40:15.840 align:start position:0%
million he's referencing includes the 10
 
05:40:18.948 --> 05:40:18.958 align:start position:0%
million for the State Bank um but just
 
05:40:21.468 --> 05:40:21.478 align:start position:0%
to in in discussions with our members
 
05:40:23.830 --> 05:40:23.840 align:start position:0%
and also looking at the California study
 
05:40:25.430 --> 05:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
I'd like to point out that it's it's
 
05:40:28.110 --> 05:40:28.120 align:start position:0%
likely to cost significantly more um
 
05:40:29.670 --> 05:40:29.680 align:start position:0%
than the 10 million to get the Bank off
 
05:40:33.110 --> 05:40:33.120 align:start position:0%
the ground about how much um I will tell
 
05:40:34.868 --> 05:40:34.878 align:start position:0%
you representative major that one of our
 
05:40:36.948 --> 05:40:36.958 align:start position:0%
members h a sort of a back of the napkin
 
05:40:39.830 --> 05:40:39.840 align:start position:0%
rough estimate and would say $50 million
 
05:40:42.708 --> 05:40:42.718 align:start position:0%
um we don't know what that is exactly
 
05:40:44.548 --> 05:40:44.558 align:start position:0%
but one of the things that I'd like to
 
05:40:47.270 --> 05:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
point out is you know if you're a bank
 
05:40:50.230 --> 05:40:50.240 align:start position:0%
and you are not deploying your funds
 
05:40:52.110 --> 05:40:52.120 align:start position:0%
through your lending you do have to have
 
05:40:54.510 --> 05:40:54.520 align:start position:0%
certain Capital requirements and so
 
05:40:57.070 --> 05:40:57.080 align:start position:0%
because presumably that deposit base
 
05:40:59.468 --> 05:40:59.478 align:start position:0%
would continue to grow they'd have to
 
05:41:01.270 --> 05:41:01.280 align:start position:0%
maintain those Capital ratios which
 
05:41:02.990 --> 05:41:03.000 align:start position:0%
means the state would have to continue
 
05:41:05.350 --> 05:41:05.360 align:start position:0%
to inject funds into the bank to
 
05:41:08.390 --> 05:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:11.270 --> 05:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
ratios um we know that we now have 37
 
05:41:12.910 --> 05:41:12.920 align:start position:0%
states that have legalized medicinal
 
05:41:14.948 --> 05:41:14.958 align:start position:0%
marijuana and 18 states that have
 
05:41:17.868 --> 05:41:17.878 align:start position:0%
legalized recreational um and so we
 
05:41:19.868 --> 05:41:19.878 align:start position:0%
really believe and it's likely that the
 
05:41:21.990 --> 05:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
St the states will force the federal
 
05:41:24.670 --> 05:41:24.680 align:start position:0%
government to address uh cannabis on a
 
05:41:27.468 --> 05:41:27.478 align:start position:0%
federal level in the near future um in
 
05:41:28.990 --> 05:41:29.000 align:start position:0%
in the states that I mentioned before
 
05:41:31.310 --> 05:41:31.320 align:start position:0%
with the the 37 and the 18 we're not
 
05:41:33.310 --> 05:41:33.320 align:start position:0%
aware of a single public bank that
 
05:41:35.070 --> 05:41:35.080 align:start position:0%
supports the Cannabis
 
05:41:38.270 --> 05:41:38.280 align:start position:0%
industry the safe Banking Act um we're
 
05:41:39.990 --> 05:41:40.000 align:start position:0%
very supportive of that and that would
 
05:41:42.910 --> 05:41:42.920 align:start position:0%
give protection to Bankers um they would
 
05:41:45.350 --> 05:41:45.360 align:start position:0%
give regulatory protection when Bankers
 
05:41:47.230 --> 05:41:47.240 align:start position:0%
work with marijuana related businesses
 
05:41:48.708 --> 05:41:48.718 align:start position:0%
where it's legally permissible by the
 
05:41:50.628 --> 05:41:50.638 align:start position:0%
states um that legislation has
 
05:41:52.788 --> 05:41:52.798 align:start position:0%
bipartisan support it supported the
 
05:41:55.150 --> 05:41:55.160 align:start position:0%
house the US House five times and it's
 
05:41:58.190 --> 05:41:58.200 align:start position:0%
still very much in play this year um and
 
05:41:59.948 --> 05:41:59.958 align:start position:0%
some believe that will be addressed one
 
05:42:02.948 --> 05:42:02.958 align:start position:0%
way or another in the next 10 years so
 
05:42:04.948 --> 05:42:04.958 align:start position:0%
given the momentum on this issue around
 
05:42:07.510 --> 05:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
the country and nationally you know I we
 
05:42:09.270 --> 05:42:09.280 align:start position:0%
just have to ask the question is this a
 
05:42:11.030 --> 05:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
Sound Investment for the state because
 
05:42:13.350 --> 05:42:13.360 align:start position:0%
of the the expense to run a state bank
 
05:42:14.948 --> 05:42:14.958 align:start position:0%
and to start one
 
05:42:18.548 --> 05:42:18.558 align:start position:0%
up um Additionally the there are
 
05:42:20.910 --> 05:42:20.920 align:start position:0%
significant legal and financial risks
 
05:42:23.708 --> 05:42:23.718 align:start position:0%
for the state the state employees the
 
05:42:25.190 --> 05:42:25.200 align:start position:0%
managers anyone
 
05:42:27.468 --> 05:42:27.478 align:start position:0%
affiliated with the sale manufactured
 
05:42:29.830 --> 05:42:29.840 align:start position:0%
distribution or dispensing of C cannabis
 
05:42:32.070 --> 05:42:32.080 align:start position:0%
are exposed to significant liability and
 
05:42:35.190 --> 05:42:35.200 align:start position:0%
they can be prosecuted under federal law
 
05:42:37.270 --> 05:42:37.280 align:start position:0%
um and the funds could be S they could
 
05:42:39.110 --> 05:42:39.120 align:start position:0%
be subjected to seizure by the federal
 
05:42:40.910 --> 05:42:40.920 align:start position:0%
government I know that came up
 
05:42:43.070 --> 05:42:43.080 align:start position:0%
earlier um I've also included it's
 
05:42:45.110 --> 05:42:45.120 align:start position:0%
attached to my testimony the um the
 
05:42:47.548 --> 05:42:47.558 align:start position:0%
Attorney General in California they he
 
05:42:50.590 --> 05:42:50.600 align:start position:0%
issued um a one-page memo and in that
 
05:42:53.110 --> 05:42:53.120 align:start position:0%
memo they conclude that it's it's simply
 
05:42:55.030 --> 05:42:55.040 align:start position:0%
too risky for them to move forward and
 
05:42:56.990 --> 05:42:57.000 align:start position:0%
so I've included that for you as
 
05:43:01.468 --> 05:43:01.478 align:start position:0%
well um particularly re relating to um
 
05:43:03.190 --> 05:43:03.200 align:start position:0%
the financial picture you know one of
 
05:43:05.590 --> 05:43:05.600 align:start position:0%
the points that we wanted to make is um
 
05:43:08.910 --> 05:43:08.920 align:start position:0%
the private sector they leverage funds
 
05:43:10.990 --> 05:43:11.000 align:start position:0%
and if there's a public Bank um we don't
 
05:43:13.150 --> 05:43:13.160 align:start position:0%
believe that's going to happen it's it's
 
05:43:15.110 --> 05:43:15.120 align:start position:0%
not clear in the legislation if it's
 
05:43:16.830 --> 05:43:16.840 align:start position:0%
intended that the public bank would
 
05:43:19.110 --> 05:43:19.120 align:start position:0%
actually be in the business of lending
 
05:43:20.670 --> 05:43:20.680 align:start position:0%
but it does say it has the powers of a
 
05:43:23.510 --> 05:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
depository Bank um so we assume that
 
05:43:25.948 --> 05:43:25.958 align:start position:0%
it's not intended um and so there would
 
05:43:28.110 --> 05:43:28.120 align:start position:0%
most definitely be a loss of opportunity
 
05:43:29.990 --> 05:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
into our community
 
05:43:32.590 --> 05:43:32.600 align:start position:0%
every single day our banks um deploy
 
05:43:35.708 --> 05:43:35.718 align:start position:0%
funds and they support um homeowners
 
05:43:37.830 --> 05:43:37.840 align:start position:0%
they support business owners by
 
05:43:39.548 --> 05:43:39.558 align:start position:0%
providing access to Capital and this
 
05:43:41.070 --> 05:43:41.080 align:start position:0%
would be a missed
 
05:43:42.868 --> 05:43:42.878 align:start position:0%
opportunity a state bank would be
 
05:43:44.190 --> 05:43:44.200 align:start position:0%
diverting These funds away from
 
05:43:46.708 --> 05:43:46.718 align:start position:0%
supporting our op um our economy and
 
05:43:48.628 --> 05:43:48.638 align:start position:0%
deprive the state of tax revenue which
 
05:43:50.150 --> 05:43:50.160 align:start position:0%
local banks
 
05:43:53.230 --> 05:43:53.240 align:start position:0%
pay um and then just on the history of
 
05:43:56.150 --> 05:43:56.160 align:start position:0%
State Bank proposals uh by our count um
 
05:43:57.830 --> 05:43:57.840 align:start position:0%
it's been attempted six times in the
 
05:44:00.750 --> 05:44:00.760 align:start position:0%
past 15 years here um in New Hampshire
 
05:44:02.910 --> 05:44:02.920 align:start position:0%
and every single time the um legislature
 
05:44:04.310 --> 05:44:04.320 align:start position:0%
has decided that that is not the
 
05:44:06.110 --> 05:44:06.120 align:start position:0%
appropriate course of action for the
 
05:44:10.468 --> 05:44:10.478 align:start position:0%
state um around the country between 1917
 
05:44:13.510 --> 05:44:13.520 align:start position:0%
and 2017 there were 29 public banks that
 
05:44:15.750 --> 05:44:15.760 align:start position:0%
have been chartered there are only two
 
05:44:18.070 --> 05:44:18.080 align:start position:0%
that are in operation today um and those
 
05:44:20.150 --> 05:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
are two I think pretty extenda
 
05:44:22.628 --> 05:44:22.638 align:start position:0%
circumstances um so I think the evidence
 
05:44:25.150 --> 05:44:25.160 align:start position:0%
shows it's just not
 
05:44:28.070 --> 05:44:28.080 align:start position:0%
necessary and then lastly um we believe
 
05:44:31.510 --> 05:44:31.520 align:start position:0%
that this is a is a slippery slope um I
 
05:44:34.868 --> 05:44:34.878 align:start position:0%
understand that um it's this is really
 
05:44:36.190 --> 05:44:36.200 align:start position:0%
supposed to be a back stop but I'd like
 
05:44:38.190 --> 05:44:38.200 align:start position:0%
to point out that even though it talks
 
05:44:40.548 --> 05:44:40.558 align:start position:0%
about contingent Financial Services I
 
05:44:44.310 --> 05:44:44.320 align:start position:0%
did not see an actual contingency Clause
 
05:44:46.230 --> 05:44:46.240 align:start position:0%
um typically it's certified by the
 
05:44:48.310 --> 05:44:48.320 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State um I didn't see that
 
05:44:52.948 --> 05:44:52.958 align:start position:0%
in here um maybe I missed it but um as
 
05:44:54.590 --> 05:44:54.600 align:start position:0%
it's drafted it would put a State Bank
 
05:44:57.070 --> 05:44:57.080 align:start position:0%
in statute and we really believe that
 
05:44:58.590 --> 05:44:58.600 align:start position:0%
even though it's very narrow in scope
 
05:45:00.868 --> 05:45:00.878 align:start position:0%
today it's very easy to expand that in
 
05:45:02.750 --> 05:45:02.760 align:start position:0%
the future um and we believe that would
 
05:45:04.270 --> 05:45:04.280 align:start position:0%
that would compete with Private Industry
 
05:45:07.430 --> 05:45:07.440 align:start position:0%
so um in closing we don't believe this
 
05:45:10.070 --> 05:45:10.080 align:start position:0%
is necessary and believe it faces many
 
05:45:13.030 --> 05:45:13.040 align:start position:0%
log logistical challenges um so for all
 
05:45:14.750 --> 05:45:14.760 align:start position:0%
these reasons we would urge the the
 
05:45:16.868 --> 05:45:16.878 align:start position:0%
committee to reject the State Bank um
 
05:45:18.510 --> 05:45:18.520 align:start position:0%
and to amend the bill by removing the
 
05:45:20.510 --> 05:45:20.520 align:start position:0%
relevant sections so I'm happy to try to
 
05:45:22.110 --> 05:45:22.120 align:start position:0%
answer any questions you may
 
05:45:24.948 --> 05:45:24.958 align:start position:0%
have representative Bry followed by
 
05:45:27.350 --> 05:45:27.360 align:start position:0%
representative elme okay thank you Mr
 
05:45:29.868 --> 05:45:29.878 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for your testimony uh
 
05:45:33.070 --> 05:45:33.080 align:start position:0%
yes on page 11 of the bill on line 11 is
 
05:45:36.830 --> 05:45:36.840 align:start position:0%
the $10 million figure okay that's being
 
05:45:38.190 --> 05:45:38.200 align:start position:0%
requested but did I hear you correctly
 
05:45:40.030 --> 05:45:40.040 align:start position:0%
you're saying that that's not really a
 
05:45:42.548 --> 05:45:42.558 align:start position:0%
what it's going to take to fund this
 
05:45:44.510 --> 05:45:44.520 align:start position:0%
it's that's discussions with our members
 
05:45:46.070 --> 05:45:46.080 align:start position:0%
and looking at the California study we
 
05:45:48.110 --> 05:45:48.120 align:start position:0%
do think that's on the low side and what
 
05:45:49.590 --> 05:45:49.600 align:start position:0%
do you think it would be you said did
 
05:45:52.110 --> 05:45:52.120 align:start position:0%
you say 50 million 50 million one of our
 
05:45:53.628 --> 05:45:53.638 align:start position:0%
members did sort of a just a rough
 
05:45:54.990 --> 05:45:55.000 align:start position:0%
estimate on what they think the capital
 
05:45:57.150 --> 05:45:57.160 align:start position:0%
is going to be necessary and as I said
 
05:45:59.190 --> 05:45:59.200 align:start position:0%
if if those funds are not continually
 
05:46:01.350 --> 05:46:01.360 align:start position:0%
deployed into the community and if you
 
05:46:03.468 --> 05:46:03.478 align:start position:0%
assume that deposit base continues to
 
05:46:06.110 --> 05:46:06.120 align:start position:0%
grow you're going to have to continue to
 
05:46:08.830 --> 05:46:08.840 align:start position:0%
inject funds into the state bank to make
 
05:46:10.270 --> 05:46:10.280 align:start position:0%
sure you maintain the appropriate
 
05:46:12.590 --> 05:46:12.600 align:start position:0%
Capital ratios okay and one one other
 
05:46:15.468 --> 05:46:15.478 align:start position:0%
question Mr chair so when you when you
 
05:46:18.270 --> 05:46:18.280 align:start position:0%
quoted the study was it California study
 
05:46:19.430 --> 05:46:19.440 align:start position:0%
that's correct is this the study we're
 
05:46:21.190 --> 05:46:21.200 align:start position:0%
talking about yes I don't know if all
 
05:46:22.750 --> 05:46:22.760 align:start position:0%
the members have
 
05:46:25.230 --> 05:46:25.240 align:start position:0%
this I think your associate Ryan your
 
05:46:27.030 --> 05:46:27.040 align:start position:0%
associate gave this to me the other day
 
05:46:29.030 --> 05:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
when I saw him in and I had 25 five
 
05:46:30.270 --> 05:46:30.280 align:start position:0%
copies for you do have copies for
 
05:46:31.830 --> 05:46:31.840 align:start position:0%
everybody okay thank you if they'd like
 
05:46:34.190 --> 05:46:34.200 align:start position:0%
yes all right thank
 
05:46:37.590 --> 05:46:37.600 align:start position:0%
you representative Aly followed by
 
05:46:40.708 --> 05:46:40.718 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy thank you uh Mr
 
05:46:46.310 --> 05:46:46.320 align:start position:0%
chairman on page 10 starting line 17 is
 
05:46:49.230 --> 05:46:49.240 align:start position:0%
what you were looking for uh they would
 
05:46:54.628 --> 05:46:54.638 align:start position:0%
not um they require first that liquor do
 
05:46:57.310 --> 05:46:57.320 align:start position:0%
an analysis which I think would take a
 
05:47:01.310 --> 05:47:01.320 align:start position:0%
year on and find out if local banks
 
05:47:04.430 --> 05:47:04.440 align:start position:0%
would be interested and upon receipt of
 
05:47:08.110 --> 05:47:08.120 align:start position:0%
the notice that they have not found any
 
05:47:10.430 --> 05:47:10.440 align:start position:0%
uh the business Finance Authority shall
 
05:47:12.708 --> 05:47:12.718 align:start position:0%
be authorized to incorporate own and
 
05:47:15.990 --> 05:47:16.000 align:start position:0%
operate a single-purpose depositary bank
 
05:47:18.670 --> 05:47:18.680 align:start position:0%
which I think you've covered quite well
 
05:47:21.390 --> 05:47:21.400 align:start position:0%
what that would mean but I did want to
 
05:47:25.390 --> 05:47:25.400 align:start position:0%
ask you I think I remember that the
 
05:47:28.270 --> 05:47:28.280 align:start position:0%
reason so many private Banks were able
 
05:47:30.548 --> 05:47:30.558 align:start position:0%
to get involved in the
 
05:47:35.110 --> 05:47:35.120 align:start position:0%
marijuana uh area was that somebody in a
 
05:47:39.590 --> 05:47:39.600 align:start position:0%
major Federal Institution decided that
 
05:47:42.830 --> 05:47:42.840 align:start position:0%
if you didn't have more than 15% or
 
05:47:47.190 --> 05:47:47.200 align:start position:0%
something like that of your loans out in
 
05:47:50.350 --> 05:47:50.360 align:start position:0%
marijuana that you would be
 
05:47:52.990 --> 05:47:53.000 align:start position:0%
okay um I'm not familiar with that
 
05:47:56.430 --> 05:47:56.440 align:start position:0%
exactly but what I can tell you is um
 
05:47:58.670 --> 05:47:58.680 align:start position:0%
it's it's referenced in the California
 
05:48:00.628 --> 05:48:00.638 align:start position:0%
studi then one of their conclusions is
 
05:48:02.910 --> 05:48:02.920 align:start position:0%
to let the private sector get into this
 
05:48:05.070 --> 05:48:05.080 align:start position:0%
business and they they expect that it
 
05:48:06.910 --> 05:48:06.920 align:start position:0%
would continue that the private uh
 
05:48:08.510 --> 05:48:08.520 align:start position:0%
banking system will continue to Bank in
 
05:48:10.190 --> 05:48:10.200 align:start position:0%
this space and part of the reason is
 
05:48:13.310 --> 05:48:13.320 align:start position:0%
because it's a it's a a bank can decide
 
05:48:15.030 --> 05:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
how much percentage of that portfolio it
 
05:48:16.990 --> 05:48:17.000 align:start position:0%
will be that they would like it to be
 
05:48:18.390 --> 05:48:18.400 align:start position:0%
whereas if the state goes into the
 
05:48:20.990 --> 05:48:21.000 align:start position:0%
business and it's 100% of um their
 
05:48:22.750 --> 05:48:22.760 align:start position:0%
portfolio then it's obviously a high
 
05:48:22.760 --> 05:48:23.990 align:start position:0%
portfolio then it's obviously a high
concentration

05:48:23.990 --> 05:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
concentration
 
05:48:27.628 --> 05:48:27.638 align:start position:0%
risk yes just short followup but that is
 
05:48:29.910 --> 05:48:29.920 align:start position:0%
the state of California defi deciding
 
05:48:33.788 --> 05:48:33.798 align:start position:0%
for itself but this was uh a major part
 
05:48:36.548 --> 05:48:36.558 align:start position:0%
of the banking apparatus of the federal
 
05:48:38.310 --> 05:48:38.320 align:start position:0%
government I'm not familiar
 
05:48:41.230 --> 05:48:41.240 align:start position:0%
representative but I do know that um
 
05:48:43.788 --> 05:48:43.798 align:start position:0%
what was known as the co memo um I
 
05:48:46.190 --> 05:48:46.200 align:start position:0%
believe was issued by attorney us
 
05:48:48.868 --> 05:48:48.878 align:start position:0%
attorney general Cole that talked about
 
05:48:52.190 --> 05:48:52.200 align:start position:0%
um law enforcement not going after the
 
05:48:55.110 --> 05:48:55.120 align:start position:0%
banking industry or other Industries um
 
05:48:56.750 --> 05:48:56.760 align:start position:0%
and then I think there were different
 
05:48:58.670 --> 05:48:58.680 align:start position:0%
people that said to ignore that so I'm
 
05:48:59.468 --> 05:48:59.478 align:start position:0%
not sure if that's what you're
 
05:49:01.110 --> 05:49:01.120 align:start position:0%
referencing I'm I'm just not familiar
 
05:49:02.788 --> 05:49:02.798 align:start position:0%
with that representative I'm sorry this
 
05:49:05.030 --> 05:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
was about four or five years ago but I
 
05:49:06.788 --> 05:49:06.798 align:start position:0%
do remember there was a specific
 
05:49:08.708 --> 05:49:08.718 align:start position:0%
percentage that if you went above it you
 
05:49:10.230 --> 05:49:10.240 align:start position:0%
were in trouble and if you didn't you
 
05:49:13.230 --> 05:49:13.240 align:start position:0%
were fine okay okay you're all set yeah
 
05:49:15.390 --> 05:49:15.400 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy thank you Mr
 
05:49:16.510 --> 05:49:16.520 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for your
 
05:49:19.708 --> 05:49:19.718 align:start position:0%
testimony to take my question uh the
 
05:49:21.390 --> 05:49:21.400 align:start position:0%
sponsor mentions that the state bank
 
05:49:24.670 --> 05:49:24.680 align:start position:0%
would be Plan B a backup system you list
 
05:49:27.190 --> 05:49:27.200 align:start position:0%
about 40 or so banks that are members in
 
05:49:29.750 --> 05:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
your organization would the majority of
 
05:49:32.150 --> 05:49:32.160 align:start position:0%
those Banks be able to serve as the bank
 
05:49:35.230 --> 05:49:35.240 align:start position:0%
for marijuana you know related
 
05:49:38.910 --> 05:49:38.920 align:start position:0%
businesses um they would be able to it's
 
05:49:40.788 --> 05:49:40.798 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a business decision as to
 
05:49:43.150 --> 05:49:43.160 align:start position:0%
whether and that they they decide to um
 
05:49:46.110 --> 05:49:46.120 align:start position:0%
I think based on the revenue projections
 
05:49:48.190 --> 05:49:48.200 align:start position:0%
will be really important to um I think
 
05:49:49.708 --> 05:49:49.718 align:start position:0%
that will determine how many banks are
 
05:49:51.310 --> 05:49:51.320 align:start position:0%
necessary I think you're going to
 
05:49:52.788 --> 05:49:52.798 align:start position:0%
probably need several I don't think
 
05:49:55.350 --> 05:49:55.360 align:start position:0%
it'll be just one um I think it will
 
05:49:57.510 --> 05:49:57.520 align:start position:0%
probably have to be several but um any
 
05:49:59.430 --> 05:49:59.440 align:start position:0%
of the banks any of our members has the
 
05:50:01.510 --> 05:50:01.520 align:start position:0%
ability to do so it's simply a business
 
05:50:05.230 --> 05:50:05.240 align:start position:0%
decision but um as I said I have um they
 
05:50:07.708 --> 05:50:07.718 align:start position:0%
are the banks Our member banks are aware
 
05:50:09.708 --> 05:50:09.718 align:start position:0%
of this legislation they're aware of the
 
05:50:12.270 --> 05:50:12.280 align:start position:0%
proposal um and as it's proposed with
 
05:50:14.110 --> 05:50:14.120 align:start position:0%
the state as the customer we do believe
 
05:50:16.390 --> 05:50:16.400 align:start position:0%
there will be interest and then we we do
 
05:50:17.830 --> 05:50:17.840 align:start position:0%
believe there will be banking services
 
05:50:21.070 --> 05:50:21.080 align:start position:0%
available in the private sector so so
 
05:50:22.190 --> 05:50:22.200 align:start position:0%
what you're saying is that they have the
 
05:50:24.510 --> 05:50:24.520 align:start position:0%
capability of doing it do you know if
 
05:50:26.430 --> 05:50:26.440 align:start position:0%
many of them have said signal that they
 
05:50:28.948 --> 05:50:28.958 align:start position:0%
would be willing to do it
 
05:50:31.030 --> 05:50:31.040 align:start position:0%
yes repr that's that's what I'm saying
 
05:50:33.390 --> 05:50:33.400 align:start position:0%
is we have had members tell us that they
 
05:50:35.150 --> 05:50:35.160 align:start position:0%
would pursue this if this becomes law
 
05:50:35.160 --> 05:50:35.868 align:start position:0%
would pursue this if this becomes law
thank

05:50:35.868 --> 05:50:35.878 align:start position:0%
thank
 
05:50:39.430 --> 05:50:39.440 align:start position:0%
you further questions represent lion
 
05:50:42.150 --> 05:50:42.160 align:start position:0%
thank you so again if I'm if I want to
 
05:50:43.468 --> 05:50:43.478 align:start position:0%
just be really clear on what you just
 
05:50:45.310 --> 05:50:45.320 align:start position:0%
said was that under the availability of
 
05:50:47.468 --> 05:50:47.478 align:start position:0%
banking services line on page nine where
 
05:50:50.230 --> 05:50:50.240 align:start position:0%
it talks about um the commission will
 
05:50:52.510 --> 05:50:52.520 align:start position:0%
create a study and the study will look
 
05:50:53.868 --> 05:50:53.878 align:start position:0%
at whether or not there's financial
 
05:50:56.350 --> 05:50:56.360 align:start position:0%
services and on the opt the only rate
 
05:50:59.150 --> 05:50:59.160 align:start position:0%
way a State Bank gets created as as a a
 
05:51:01.548 --> 05:51:01.558 align:start position:0%
belt and suspender solution is that if
 
05:51:03.510 --> 05:51:03.520 align:start position:0%
the study says there's no banking
 
05:51:07.270 --> 05:51:07.280 align:start position:0%
services available and and and you don't
 
05:51:08.590 --> 05:51:08.600 align:start position:0%
think that would be the outcome of the
 
05:51:10.190 --> 05:51:10.200 align:start position:0%
study the study would be that there are
 
05:51:12.548 --> 05:51:12.558 align:start position:0%
banking services readily available to
 
05:51:14.430 --> 05:51:14.440 align:start position:0%
people within the state of New Hampshire
 
05:51:16.230 --> 05:51:16.240 align:start position:0%
under this if this legislation would
 
05:51:19.070 --> 05:51:19.080 align:start position:0%
pass that's correct and is it it's my
 
05:51:20.708 --> 05:51:20.718 align:start position:0%
understanding there's already one and I
 
05:51:21.788 --> 05:51:21.798 align:start position:0%
don't want to use the name of it but
 
05:51:23.310 --> 05:51:23.320 align:start position:0%
there's already a bank being used by
 
05:51:24.390 --> 05:51:24.400 align:start position:0%
some of the
 
05:51:26.948 --> 05:51:26.958 align:start position:0%
atc's um in the state of New Hampshire
 
05:51:28.548 --> 05:51:28.558 align:start position:0%
that is that is controlled Within State
 
05:51:29.910 --> 05:51:29.920 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire so right off the bat I
 
05:51:31.670 --> 05:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
can think of the mere fact we have one
 
05:51:33.990 --> 05:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
bank that's already doing it the study
 
05:51:35.468 --> 05:51:35.478 align:start position:0%
would find nothing and the contingency
 
05:51:37.910 --> 05:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
plan would never be hit is that correct
 
05:51:39.830 --> 05:51:39.840 align:start position:0%
that's that's my belief and and we would
 
05:51:41.628 --> 05:51:41.638 align:start position:0%
ask that we I guess we would just say
 
05:51:44.430 --> 05:51:44.440 align:start position:0%
that the the section isn't necessary um
 
05:51:46.628 --> 05:51:46.638 align:start position:0%
and that that Banks could handle it and
 
05:51:48.270 --> 05:51:48.280 align:start position:0%
um it it may be a technical point and
 
05:51:50.270 --> 05:51:50.280 align:start position:0%
maybe it's a question for OS but like I
 
05:51:51.788 --> 05:51:51.798 align:start position:0%
said it does refer to contingent
 
05:51:54.868 --> 05:51:54.878 align:start position:0%
Financial Services um but I believe
 
05:51:56.708 --> 05:51:56.718 align:start position:0%
there are sometimes an actual section in
 
05:51:58.510 --> 05:51:58.520 align:start position:0%
the back near the effective dates that
 
05:52:00.510 --> 05:52:00.520 align:start position:0%
contingency and effective date and it
 
05:52:01.750 --> 05:52:01.760 align:start position:0%
gets certified and that kind of thing I
 
05:52:03.510 --> 05:52:03.520 align:start position:0%
didn't see that in here maybe I missed
 
05:52:06.350 --> 05:52:06.360 align:start position:0%
it um but as it reads it would simply
 
05:52:08.750 --> 05:52:08.760 align:start position:0%
put the section into statute so we would
 
05:52:09.788 --> 05:52:09.798 align:start position:0%
we just think it's a dangerous
 
05:52:13.628 --> 05:52:13.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:16.868 --> 05:52:16.878 align:start position:0%
that Bernstein thank you Mr chair thank
 
05:52:18.390 --> 05:52:18.400 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony and taking my
 
05:52:20.590 --> 05:52:20.600 align:start position:0%
question on page two where you refer to
 
05:52:23.788 --> 05:52:23.798 align:start position:0%
the safe Banking Act there's one
 
05:52:25.390 --> 05:52:25.400 align:start position:0%
sentence in there which is sort of in
 
05:52:27.230 --> 05:52:27.240 align:start position:0%
congruent with everything else you talk
 
05:52:29.190 --> 05:52:29.200 align:start position:0%
about how there's B partisan support and
 
05:52:31.190 --> 05:52:31.200 align:start position:0%
then the last sentence says that there's
 
05:52:33.548 --> 05:52:33.558 align:start position:0%
a lot of momentum around this issue but
 
05:52:35.070 --> 05:52:35.080 align:start position:0%
the sentence that really troubles me
 
05:52:36.590 --> 05:52:36.600 align:start position:0%
some believe this will be addressed one
 
05:52:40.430 --> 05:52:40.440 align:start position:0%
way or another within 10 years yes what
 
05:52:41.868 --> 05:52:41.878 align:start position:0%
happened to all the momentum and
 
05:52:44.110 --> 05:52:44.120 align:start position:0%
bipartisan support how do you get to
 
05:52:45.990 --> 05:52:46.000 align:start position:0%
that 10
 
05:52:48.468 --> 05:52:48.478 align:start position:0%
year all I can tell you I think in
 
05:52:50.350 --> 05:52:50.360 align:start position:0%
talking with our members we have been
 
05:52:51.910 --> 05:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
advocating for the safe Banking Act for
 
05:52:54.628 --> 05:52:54.638 align:start position:0%
several years and um we work very
 
05:52:57.510 --> 05:52:57.520 align:start position:0%
closely with people in Washington um on
 
05:52:58.708 --> 05:52:58.718 align:start position:0%
federal issues
 
05:53:00.230 --> 05:53:00.240 align:start position:0%
particularly as it relates to this and
 
05:53:02.110 --> 05:53:02.120 align:start position:0%
they believe this is the best session
 
05:53:03.590 --> 05:53:03.600 align:start position:0%
the best chance we've had in a long time
 
05:53:08.230 --> 05:53:08.240 align:start position:0%
to pass it so the statement is that it's
 
05:53:10.270 --> 05:53:10.280 align:start position:0%
commonly believed that within the next
 
05:53:12.708 --> 05:53:12.718 align:start position:0%
between 1 to 10 years that this will be
 
05:53:15.270 --> 05:53:15.280 align:start position:0%
addressed either by more and more States
 
05:53:17.390 --> 05:53:17.400 align:start position:0%
re legalizing this in one form or
 
05:53:18.708 --> 05:53:18.718 align:start position:0%
another and it's going to force
 
05:53:21.708 --> 05:53:21.718 align:start position:0%
Washington to do that so the the the
 
05:53:23.868 --> 05:53:23.878 align:start position:0%
bigger point that um I was trying to
 
05:53:26.830 --> 05:53:26.840 align:start position:0%
convey representative was that given the
 
05:53:28.670 --> 05:53:28.680 align:start position:0%
high cost
 
05:53:29.948 --> 05:53:29.958 align:start position:0%
um to the state of New Hampshire to
 
05:53:32.548 --> 05:53:32.558 align:start position:0%
start this up and then maintain this um
 
05:53:35.628 --> 05:53:35.638 align:start position:0%
would it become irrelevant or moot if it
 
05:53:37.230 --> 05:53:37.240 align:start position:0%
is addressed at the federal level and is
 
05:53:39.628 --> 05:53:39.638 align:start position:0%
it a Sound Investment for the state okay
 
05:53:42.070 --> 05:53:42.080 align:start position:0%
I appreciate your answer thank you
 
05:53:46.910 --> 05:53:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:50.350 --> 05:53:50.360 align:start position:0%
questions repr preach thank you Mr
 
05:53:52.708 --> 05:53:52.718 align:start position:0%
chairman uh and thank you for taking my
 
05:53:55.230 --> 05:53:55.240 align:start position:0%
question uh I believe the two Banks one
 
05:53:56.990 --> 05:53:57.000 align:start position:0%
of them is North Dakota I don't know
 
05:53:58.990 --> 05:53:59.000 align:start position:0%
what the other one is but uh what do you
 
05:54:00.708 --> 05:54:00.718 align:start position:0%
attribute to their success because they
 
05:54:02.510 --> 05:54:02.520 align:start position:0%
have been successful over a number of
 
05:54:04.948 --> 05:54:04.958 align:start position:0%
years yes um thank you for that question
 
05:54:06.390 --> 05:54:06.400 align:start position:0%
I wrote it down because I knew someone
 
05:54:09.350 --> 05:54:09.360 align:start position:0%
would ask um yes in 1919 it was the Bank
 
05:54:11.948 --> 05:54:11.958 align:start position:0%
of North Dakota and I believe they have
 
05:54:15.110 --> 05:54:15.120 align:start position:0%
one location and now it's uh it and they
 
05:54:17.030 --> 05:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
were started because there were no other
 
05:54:19.430 --> 05:54:19.440 align:start position:0%
banking services available to them um
 
05:54:21.670 --> 05:54:21.680 align:start position:0%
the other one is a newer one within the
 
05:54:23.628 --> 05:54:23.638 align:start position:0%
last five years it's the territorial
 
05:54:26.310 --> 05:54:26.320 align:start position:0%
Bank of American Samoa um in my
 
05:54:28.868 --> 05:54:28.878 align:start position:0%
understanding is the Bank of Hawaii left
 
05:54:30.350 --> 05:54:30.360 align:start position:0%
and they had virtually no banking
 
05:54:30.360 --> 05:54:31.670 align:start position:0%
and they had virtually no banking
services

05:54:31.670 --> 05:54:31.680 align:start position:0%
services
 
05:54:34.910 --> 05:54:34.920 align:start position:0%
available followup followup uh what do
 
05:54:36.830 --> 05:54:36.840 align:start position:0%
you attribute to success I mean just
 
05:54:39.150 --> 05:54:39.160 align:start position:0%
because they there's no other Banks but
 
05:54:40.830 --> 05:54:40.840 align:start position:0%
and what what was their Capital to start
 
05:54:42.430 --> 05:54:42.440 align:start position:0%
with if you know I'm sorry
 
05:54:44.190 --> 05:54:44.200 align:start position:0%
representative I don't know that um I
 
05:54:46.948 --> 05:54:46.958 align:start position:0%
could try to find out but um I know that
 
05:54:48.708 --> 05:54:48.718 align:start position:0%
in working with some of my colleagues
 
05:54:50.910 --> 05:54:50.920 align:start position:0%
because as I said a state bank has um
 
05:54:52.868 --> 05:54:52.878 align:start position:0%
that's a that's an issue that is often
 
05:54:56.750 --> 05:54:56.760 align:start position:0%
visited um here in in our state house um
 
05:54:58.590 --> 05:54:58.600 align:start position:0%
and talking with some of my colleagues I
 
05:55:00.110 --> 05:55:00.120 align:start position:0%
understand that the Bank of North Dakota
 
05:55:02.350 --> 05:55:02.360 align:start position:0%
has said don't follow our model so um
 
05:55:04.070 --> 05:55:04.080 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure how you would gauge success
 
05:55:05.468 --> 05:55:05.478 align:start position:0%
but I and we'll see how the the
 
05:55:08.070 --> 05:55:08.080 align:start position:0%
territorial Bank of America Samoa is um
 
05:55:09.830 --> 05:55:09.840 align:start position:0%
if they truly if that really is the only
 
05:55:11.310 --> 05:55:11.320 align:start position:0%
provider of financial services I would
 
05:55:14.390 --> 05:55:14.400 align:start position:0%
say that's why they are
 
05:55:16.510 --> 05:55:16.520 align:start position:0%
successful further
 
05:55:18.750 --> 05:55:18.760 align:start position:0%
questions saying none thank you very
 
05:55:23.390 --> 05:55:23.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:23.400 --> 05:55:25.310 align:start position:0%
 
is

05:55:25.310 --> 05:55:25.320 align:start position:0%

Examiner Wells
 
05:56:02.070 --> 05:56:02.080 align:start position:0%
okay thank uh we're from the New
 
05:56:03.350 --> 05:56:03.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire banking Department thank you
 
05:56:08.270 --> 05:56:08.280 align:start position:0%
for taking our testimony today um so um
 
05:56:09.948 --> 05:56:09.958 align:start position:0%
the focus of Our Testimony is obviously
 
05:56:11.350 --> 05:56:11.360 align:start position:0%
going to be on uh the sections of the
 
05:56:12.990 --> 05:56:13.000 align:start position:0%
bill related to the availability of
 
05:56:15.990 --> 05:56:16.000 align:start position:0%
banking services that start on page nine
 
05:56:18.510 --> 05:56:18.520 align:start position:0%
um I don't want to rehash too much at
 
05:56:20.430 --> 05:56:20.440 align:start position:0%
chrisy with the bankers Association did
 
05:56:22.510 --> 05:56:22.520 align:start position:0%
a good job and a lot of my testimony was
 
05:56:23.990 --> 05:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
kind of going to overlap with what she
 
05:56:26.230 --> 05:56:26.240 align:start position:0%
said so I'm going to try not to rehash
 
05:56:29.430 --> 05:56:29.440 align:start position:0%
that um we are we have no position on
 
05:56:32.830 --> 05:56:32.840 align:start position:0%
the underlying policy of this bill um
 
05:56:34.430 --> 05:56:34.440 align:start position:0%
any commentary we're going to provide is
 
05:56:36.468 --> 05:56:36.478 align:start position:0%
going to be focused on the feasibility
 
05:56:39.510 --> 05:56:39.520 align:start position:0%
and any technical nuances related to uh
 
05:56:42.670 --> 05:56:42.680 align:start position:0%
banking regulation um a high level
 
05:56:45.110 --> 05:56:45.120 align:start position:0%
summary of um what we're about to talk
 
05:56:48.750 --> 05:56:48.760 align:start position:0%
about is um number one um you likely
 
05:56:52.628 --> 05:56:52.638 align:start position:0%
don't need a public or State Bank to do
 
05:56:56.070 --> 05:56:56.080 align:start position:0%
um what this bill is trying to do um and
 
05:56:58.350 --> 05:56:58.360 align:start position:0%
two if the legislature
 
05:57:00.750 --> 05:57:00.760 align:start position:0%
um makes a policy decision to establish
 
05:57:03.350 --> 05:57:03.360 align:start position:0%
a State Bank um it's likely going to
 
05:57:06.670 --> 05:57:06.680 align:start position:0%
cost significantly more than this bill
 
05:57:09.070 --> 05:57:09.080 align:start position:0%
explains or or
 
05:57:12.110 --> 05:57:12.120 align:start position:0%
anticipates um so first and I don't want
 
05:57:15.190 --> 05:57:15.200 align:start position:0%
to belabor this point because I think um
 
05:57:17.110 --> 05:57:17.120 align:start position:0%
the bankers Association just testified
 
05:57:19.830 --> 05:57:19.840 align:start position:0%
to it but um as you're aware several
 
05:57:21.868 --> 05:57:21.878 align:start position:0%
States including our surrounding states
 
05:57:24.150 --> 05:57:24.160 align:start position:0%
of Maine Vermont and Massachusetts have
 
05:57:26.390 --> 05:57:26.400 align:start position:0%
already legalized marijuana and none of
 
05:57:28.030 --> 05:57:28.040 align:start position:0%
those states have required a state State
 
05:57:31.990 --> 05:57:32.000 align:start position:0%
Bank to to bank the marijuana business
 
05:57:35.868 --> 05:57:35.878 align:start position:0%
um as um Christy merell testified
 
05:57:38.110 --> 05:57:38.120 align:start position:0%
there's finson guidance out there that
 
05:57:40.750 --> 05:57:40.760 align:start position:0%
that um provides a pathway for um
 
05:57:44.670 --> 05:57:44.680 align:start position:0%
private Banks to bank this business um
 
05:57:46.830 --> 05:57:46.840 align:start position:0%
so there's there's nothing um
 
05:57:48.708 --> 05:57:48.718 align:start position:0%
technically preventing them from doing
 
05:57:48.718 --> 05:57:50.468 align:start position:0%
technically preventing them from doing
it

05:57:50.468 --> 05:57:50.478 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:57:53.990 --> 05:57:54.000 align:start position:0%
um in in anticipation of this uh
 
05:57:56.830 --> 05:57:56.840 align:start position:0%
testimony Chief Bank examiner Wells did
 
05:57:59.948 --> 05:57:59.958 align:start position:0%
reach out to um our his counterpart in
 
05:58:03.590 --> 05:58:03.600 align:start position:0%
Maine just to kind of find out um how
 
05:58:06.270 --> 05:58:06.280 align:start position:0%
that works in Maine um and I'm H we can
 
05:58:07.788 --> 05:58:07.798 align:start position:0%
answer any questions about that I don't
 
05:58:09.230 --> 05:58:09.240 align:start position:0%
want to belabor it though too much
 
05:58:11.510 --> 05:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
because I know this is not policy a
 
05:58:14.670 --> 05:58:14.680 align:start position:0%
policy driven uh committee um but we do
 
05:58:17.230 --> 05:58:17.240 align:start position:0%
have that information if you are
 
05:58:20.750 --> 05:58:20.760 align:start position:0%
interested um and I you know I I think
 
05:58:22.708 --> 05:58:22.718 align:start position:0%
it's reason reasonable to anticipate
 
05:58:24.110 --> 05:58:24.120 align:start position:0%
that if New Hampshire moves this bill
 
05:58:26.708 --> 05:58:26.718 align:start position:0%
forward um New Hampshire chartered banks
 
05:58:28.990 --> 05:58:29.000 align:start position:0%
will likely move in into this area of
 
05:58:31.548 --> 05:58:31.558 align:start position:0%
business um so that's kind of the first
 
05:58:33.150 --> 05:58:33.160 align:start position:0%
point that I'm not sure that a State
 
05:58:36.350 --> 05:58:36.360 align:start position:0%
Bank is going to be or a public bank is
 
05:58:37.390 --> 05:58:37.400 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
05:58:41.990 --> 05:58:42.000 align:start position:0%
required um so moving on to the more um
 
05:58:44.030 --> 05:58:44.040 align:start position:0%
kind of technical aspects of it and the
 
05:58:47.270 --> 05:58:47.280 align:start position:0%
financial aspects of it um like I said I
 
05:58:49.070 --> 05:58:49.080 align:start position:0%
think this is going to cost way more
 
05:58:51.548 --> 05:58:51.558 align:start position:0%
than this bill anticipates if you decide
 
05:58:55.510 --> 05:58:55.520 align:start position:0%
to move it forward um like how much uh
 
05:58:57.788 --> 05:58:57.798 align:start position:0%
well that's a good question because as
 
05:58:59.590 --> 05:58:59.600 align:start position:0%
established nobody's really done this
 
05:59:03.190 --> 05:59:03.200 align:start position:0%
before um so right now the kind of going
 
05:59:07.270 --> 05:59:07.280 align:start position:0%
capitalization rate for a plain vanilla
 
05:59:09.948 --> 05:59:09.958 align:start position:0%
private bank is about $20 million give
 
05:59:13.150 --> 05:59:13.160 align:start position:0%
or take that's set by the FDIC under our
 
05:59:14.910 --> 05:59:14.920 align:start position:0%
law if you file an application with us
 
05:59:17.628 --> 05:59:17.638 align:start position:0%
you're required to obtain FDIC Insurance
 
05:59:21.270 --> 05:59:21.280 align:start position:0%
the FDIC with their regulations um
 
05:59:23.070 --> 05:59:23.080 align:start position:0%
really is the driving force setting the
 
05:59:26.590 --> 05:59:26.600 align:start position:0%
capital amount um so in our experience
 
05:59:28.990 --> 05:59:29.000 align:start position:0%
about $20 million for for a vanilla Bank
 
05:59:31.750 --> 05:59:31.760 align:start position:0%
this Bank obviously would be um very
 
05:59:33.910 --> 05:59:33.920 align:start position:0%
different than anything else out there
 
05:59:36.230 --> 05:59:36.240 align:start position:0%
so likely that number is going to be um
 
05:59:38.310 --> 05:59:38.320 align:start position:0%
much higher I think in the California
 
05:59:41.070 --> 05:59:41.080 align:start position:0%
study they had 65 million as the capital
 
05:59:42.750 --> 05:59:42.760 align:start position:0%
requirement but again it's hard to
 
05:59:44.548 --> 05:59:44.558 align:start position:0%
predict exactly because California is
 
05:59:47.270 --> 05:59:47.280 align:start position:0%
much bigger than New Hampshire um so
 
05:59:50.670 --> 05:59:50.680 align:start position:0%
that's the capitalization part of it um
 
05:59:52.390 --> 05:59:52.400 align:start position:0%
moving there's other costs though that
 
05:59:54.230 --> 05:59:54.240 align:start position:0%
are associated with establishing a state
 
05:59:57.230 --> 05:59:57.240 align:start position:0%
bank or a state Chartered bank with us
 
05:59:59.628 --> 05:59:59.638 align:start position:0%
um so so first off there's an
 
06:00:01.310 --> 06:00:01.320 align:start position:0%
application process which this bill
 
06:00:04.468 --> 06:00:04.478 align:start position:0%
anticipates um that somebody would file
 
06:00:06.468 --> 06:00:06.478 align:start position:0%
an applica the organizers I guess would
 
06:00:09.310 --> 06:00:09.320 align:start position:0%
file an application with us I think the
 
06:00:11.190 --> 06:00:11.200 align:start position:0%
it's the business Finance Authority I
 
06:00:14.110 --> 06:00:14.120 align:start position:0%
think is the anticipated organizer um so
 
06:00:16.230 --> 06:00:16.240 align:start position:0%
they would file an application with us I
 
06:00:18.310 --> 06:00:18.320 align:start position:0%
don't have a figure for exactly how much
 
06:00:21.270 --> 06:00:21.280 align:start position:0%
it costs a private entity to file an
 
06:00:23.590 --> 06:00:23.600 align:start position:0%
application with us all I can speak to
 
06:00:26.270 --> 06:00:26.280 align:start position:0%
is how much we charge for it so that's
 
06:00:28.070 --> 06:00:28.080 align:start position:0%
kind of I'm not sure sure if that's
 
06:00:30.030 --> 06:00:30.040 align:start position:0%
something I can work with um the bankers
 
06:00:31.548 --> 06:00:31.558 align:start position:0%
Association to see if somebody could
 
06:00:33.670 --> 06:00:33.680 align:start position:0%
give a ballpark figure for that but it
 
06:00:35.708 --> 06:00:35.718 align:start position:0%
is you have to hire attorneys you have
 
06:00:37.628 --> 06:00:37.638 align:start position:0%
to develop a business plan there's um
 
06:00:39.350 --> 06:00:39.360 align:start position:0%
significant accounting costs that go
 
06:00:41.948 --> 06:00:41.958 align:start position:0%
into it um it is not cheap to form a
 
06:00:45.830 --> 06:00:45.840 align:start position:0%
bank um our fee for forming a state bank
 
06:00:45.840 --> 06:00:46.708 align:start position:0%
bank um our fee for forming a state bank
is

06:00:46.708 --> 06:00:46.718 align:start position:0%
is
 
06:00:49.548 --> 06:00:49.558 align:start position:0%
$155,000 however um we have built into
 
06:00:51.708 --> 06:00:51.718 align:start position:0%
our statute that um it's kind of like
 
06:00:54.788 --> 06:00:54.798 align:start position:0%
the think of the $155,000 as a retainer
 
06:00:57.110 --> 06:00:57.120 align:start position:0%
that you file with us and once we we
 
06:00:59.868 --> 06:00:59.878 align:start position:0%
charge our time so we track our time so
 
06:01:01.430 --> 06:01:01.440 align:start position:0%
um Chief Bank examiner Wells as he
 
06:01:03.670 --> 06:01:03.680 align:start position:0%
investigates an application we'll track
 
06:01:05.070 --> 06:01:05.080 align:start position:0%
his time and everyone else in the office
 
06:01:06.590 --> 06:01:06.600 align:start position:0%
tracks their time and once we exceed
 
06:01:09.948 --> 06:01:09.958 align:start position:0%
that $155,000 we start billing so
 
06:01:11.788 --> 06:01:11.798 align:start position:0%
basically at the end if somebody gets a
 
06:01:13.670 --> 06:01:13.680 align:start position:0%
charter they also get a bill for us for
 
06:01:16.030 --> 06:01:16.040 align:start position:0%
whatever is in excess of that
 
06:01:20.070 --> 06:01:20.080 align:start position:0%
$15,000 um the uh provision that enables
 
06:01:22.830 --> 06:01:22.840 align:start position:0%
us to charge for that time is relatively
 
06:01:25.270 --> 06:01:25.280 align:start position:0%
new um it just came into effect on
 
06:01:27.590 --> 06:01:27.600 align:start position:0%
October 9th so we don't have a lot lot
 
06:01:29.788 --> 06:01:29.798 align:start position:0%
of case studies and how much that costs
 
06:01:31.990 --> 06:01:32.000 align:start position:0%
we do have a denovo bank pending right
 
06:01:35.070 --> 06:01:35.080 align:start position:0%
now um but it's pending we're working on
 
06:01:37.070 --> 06:01:37.080 align:start position:0%
it right now so I I can't give you an
 
06:01:38.590 --> 06:01:38.600 align:start position:0%
exact figure for how much that's going
 
06:01:41.708 --> 06:01:41.718 align:start position:0%
to cost um my anti my suspicion is it
 
06:01:44.150 --> 06:01:44.160 align:start position:0%
will cost more than $15,000 to Charter a
 
06:01:48.910 --> 06:01:48.920 align:start position:0%
denovo plain vanilla Bank um probably
 
06:01:50.548 --> 06:01:50.558 align:start position:0%
something like this I'd imagine will be
 
06:01:52.948 --> 06:01:52.958 align:start position:0%
a complicated application it'll probably
 
06:01:54.868 --> 06:01:54.878 align:start position:0%
take the FDIC a significant amount of
 
06:01:56.910 --> 06:01:56.920 align:start position:0%
time to process that application it'll
 
06:01:58.310 --> 06:01:58.320 align:start position:0%
probably take us you know
 
06:02:00.750 --> 06:02:00.760 align:start position:0%
correspondingly at some time to process
 
06:02:05.948 --> 06:02:05.958 align:start position:0%
it um what kind of time
 
06:02:09.548 --> 06:02:09.558 align:start position:0%
table so ballpark um I'm trying to think
 
06:02:12.150 --> 06:02:12.160 align:start position:0%
so we again we've never tracked our time
 
06:02:14.270 --> 06:02:14.280 align:start position:0%
before so this is a relatively new fure
 
06:02:19.230 --> 06:02:19.240 align:start position:0%
month oh no so um half year uh well um
 
06:02:21.430 --> 06:02:21.440 align:start position:0%
so I can tell you under our statutes
 
06:02:23.708 --> 06:02:23.718 align:start position:0%
there is a time frame for processing an
 
06:02:26.430 --> 06:02:26.440 align:start position:0%
application um so um somebody files an
 
06:02:28.750 --> 06:02:28.760 align:start position:0%
application with us we have 30 days to
 
06:02:31.030 --> 06:02:31.040 align:start position:0%
determine it's substantially complete
 
06:02:32.430 --> 06:02:32.440 align:start position:0%
when they file the application with us
 
06:02:35.030 --> 06:02:35.040 align:start position:0%
they also file them with the FDIC the
 
06:02:37.468 --> 06:02:37.478 align:start position:0%
FDIC similarly has they call it
 
06:02:39.548 --> 06:02:39.558 align:start position:0%
something else but it's that same
 
06:02:42.310 --> 06:02:42.320 align:start position:0%
determination period of initial 30 days
 
06:02:43.788 --> 06:02:43.798 align:start position:0%
I can tell you we're pretty good about
 
06:02:45.468 --> 06:02:45.478 align:start position:0%
meeting that 30 days we're going to tell
 
06:02:48.030 --> 06:02:48.040 align:start position:0%
you if something's missing um the FDIC
 
06:02:50.150 --> 06:02:50.160 align:start position:0%
if it's a complicated Bank sometimes it
 
06:02:52.390 --> 06:02:52.400 align:start position:0%
gets kicked to DC and it can take
 
06:02:54.868 --> 06:02:54.878 align:start position:0%
significantly longer than that um those
 
06:02:58.430 --> 06:02:58.440 align:start position:0%
30 days um once an application is
 
06:03:00.628 --> 06:03:00.638 align:start position:0%
substantially complete we then move into
 
06:03:02.990 --> 06:03:03.000 align:start position:0%
our substantive review phase which is
 
06:03:05.510 --> 06:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
what um Todd and his team do um they
 
06:03:07.510 --> 06:03:07.520 align:start position:0%
conduct a complete investigation into
 
06:03:11.548 --> 06:03:11.558 align:start position:0%
the application um and um produce a
 
06:03:14.150 --> 06:03:14.160 align:start position:0%
report um that's reviewed by the office
 
06:03:17.230 --> 06:03:17.240 align:start position:0%
um so that time period is 60 days on our
 
06:03:19.948 --> 06:03:19.958 align:start position:0%
end but again that could be extended if
 
06:03:21.708 --> 06:03:21.718 align:start position:0%
we need more information and I think
 
06:03:23.390 --> 06:03:23.400 align:start position:0%
it's probably reasonable to expect that
 
06:03:27.030 --> 06:03:27.040 align:start position:0%
in a very um different application like
 
06:03:29.548 --> 06:03:29.558 align:start position:0%
this we would need um it might take
 
06:03:31.070 --> 06:03:31.080 align:start position:0%
longer than 60
 
06:03:33.670 --> 06:03:33.680 align:start position:0%
days but again we have teams of so it's
 
06:03:36.110 --> 06:03:36.120 align:start position:0%
man hours that we track for the billing
 
06:03:40.070 --> 06:03:40.080 align:start position:0%
okay um so you know that's that's um
 
06:03:42.310 --> 06:03:42.320 align:start position:0%
kind of a ballpark of the cost so again
 
06:03:44.030 --> 06:03:44.040 align:start position:0%
those are I was thinking as I was
 
06:03:45.628 --> 06:03:45.638 align:start position:0%
listening to the testimony we just
 
06:03:47.390 --> 06:03:47.400 align:start position:0%
completed a fiscal note worksheet for
 
06:03:50.548 --> 06:03:50.558 align:start position:0%
this bill and we focused on the going
 
06:03:53.190 --> 06:03:53.200 align:start position:0%
forward costs from our perspective so
 
06:03:55.390 --> 06:03:55.400 align:start position:0%
like or I guess they would be Revenue so
 
06:03:57.990 --> 06:03:58.000 align:start position:0%
we're a self-funded agency were funded
 
06:04:00.350 --> 06:04:00.360 align:start position:0%
through fees and fines that we charge to
 
06:04:02.310 --> 06:04:02.320 align:start position:0%
the entities that we regulate and at the
 
06:04:06.430 --> 06:04:06.440 align:start position:0%
end if we have um an O uh shortfall in
 
06:04:08.628 --> 06:04:08.638 align:start position:0%
our in our amount we then charge an
 
06:04:10.350 --> 06:04:10.360 align:start position:0%
assessment of everyone who's chartered
 
06:04:11.990 --> 06:04:12.000 align:start position:0%
or licensed with
 
06:04:16.390 --> 06:04:16.400 align:start position:0%
us um so when we were completing the
 
06:04:19.190 --> 06:04:19.200 align:start position:0%
fiscal note worksheet we were focusing
 
06:04:22.628 --> 06:04:22.638 align:start position:0%
on what we would charge to like examine
 
06:04:24.350 --> 06:04:24.360 align:start position:0%
a bank like this what we would charge to
 
06:04:27.708 --> 06:04:27.718 align:start position:0%
Charter it but there's other cost that
 
06:04:29.628 --> 06:04:29.638 align:start position:0%
the state would have to look at which is
 
06:04:32.788 --> 06:04:32.798 align:start position:0%
the cost to file the application with us
 
06:04:34.468 --> 06:04:34.478 align:start position:0%
and you really need all those experts to
 
06:04:36.468 --> 06:04:36.478 align:start position:0%
do that so I'm not sure it occurred to
 
06:04:37.910 --> 06:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
me as I was listening to this testimony
 
06:04:39.350 --> 06:04:39.360 align:start position:0%
I was like oh I don't know we didn't
 
06:04:40.750 --> 06:04:40.760 align:start position:0%
really note that in the fiscal note
 
06:04:42.628 --> 06:04:42.638 align:start position:0%
worksheet and it's a little strange
 
06:04:44.150 --> 06:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
because we're a state agency that
 
06:04:46.510 --> 06:04:46.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't rely we get no General funds so
 
06:04:48.150 --> 06:04:48.160 align:start position:0%
this would be like taking money from the
 
06:04:51.590 --> 06:04:51.600 align:start position:0%
general fund and paying us um for what
 
06:04:53.708 --> 06:04:53.718 align:start position:0%
it's worth it's a little unusual I'm not
 
06:04:56.150 --> 06:04:56.160 align:start position:0%
sure if we've had a situ well I know
 
06:04:57.868 --> 06:04:57.878 align:start position:0%
we've never at the bank we' never had a
 
06:05:02.430 --> 06:05:02.440 align:start position:0%
situation like this um so I think that
 
06:05:02.440 --> 06:05:03.948 align:start position:0%
situation like this um so I think that
covers

06:05:03.948 --> 06:05:03.958 align:start position:0%
covers
 
06:05:06.110 --> 06:05:06.120 align:start position:0%
capitalization um the
 
06:05:08.628 --> 06:05:08.638 align:start position:0%
application um I did want to mention
 
06:05:11.948 --> 06:05:11.958 align:start position:0%
although um Miss Merl mentioned it that
 
06:05:13.788 --> 06:05:13.798 align:start position:0%
the Federal Reserve is unlikely to issue
 
06:05:16.708 --> 06:05:16.718 align:start position:0%
a master account to this bank which
 
06:05:19.990 --> 06:05:20.000 align:start position:0%
would basically make it unfeasible to
 
06:05:24.708 --> 06:05:24.718 align:start position:0%
trans to transmit funds or wire money um
 
06:05:29.468 --> 06:05:29.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:32.230 --> 06:05:32.240 align:start position:0%
sure so very important element with the
 
06:05:33.590 --> 06:05:33.600 align:start position:0%
with the financial system is just the
 
06:05:35.788 --> 06:05:35.798 align:start position:0%
ability to to transmit funds so if we
 
06:05:38.788 --> 06:05:38.798 align:start position:0%
think of just a general scenario uh
 
06:05:41.548 --> 06:05:41.558 align:start position:0%
retail banking for example uh quite
 
06:05:43.670 --> 06:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
often customers can pay in cash they
 
06:05:46.230 --> 06:05:46.240 align:start position:0%
might be able to pay in uh check uh
 
06:05:49.468 --> 06:05:49.478 align:start position:0%
debit card credit cards so that usually
 
06:05:51.310 --> 06:05:51.320 align:start position:0%
is going to require an account at a
 
06:05:53.910 --> 06:05:53.920 align:start position:0%
financial institution by that retailer
 
06:05:56.468 --> 06:05:56.478 align:start position:0%
by that company that business and so
 
06:05:58.948 --> 06:05:58.958 align:start position:0%
most often and what what I'm aware of
 
06:06:01.030 --> 06:06:01.040 align:start position:0%
occurs in in these types of businesses
 
06:06:02.590 --> 06:06:02.600 align:start position:0%
we'll call them cannabis related
 
06:06:04.750 --> 06:06:04.760 align:start position:0%
businesses um I just want to also
 
06:06:07.390 --> 06:06:07.400 align:start position:0%
clarify that a lot of the information
 
06:06:09.670 --> 06:06:09.680 align:start position:0%
that we have as a department relative to
 
06:06:12.150 --> 06:06:12.160 align:start position:0%
these types of businesses comes from our
 
06:06:14.150 --> 06:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
communication and our interactions with
 
06:06:15.788 --> 06:06:15.798 align:start position:0%
our other Regulators state and federal
 
06:06:18.670 --> 06:06:18.680 align:start position:0%
Regulators so the reality is we you know
 
06:06:21.350 --> 06:06:21.360 align:start position:0%
we do not generally see scenarios where
 
06:06:22.948 --> 06:06:22.958 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire chartered Banks and credit
 
06:06:25.468 --> 06:06:25.478 align:start position:0%
unions are actively banking these types
 
06:06:27.750 --> 06:06:27.760 align:start position:0%
of accounts so but but but again to to
 
06:06:29.868 --> 06:06:29.878 align:start position:0%
be able to to accept that money and then
 
06:06:31.548 --> 06:06:31.558 align:start position:0%
to to go and collect through the
 
06:06:33.750 --> 06:06:33.760 align:start position:0%
financial system there there needs to be
 
06:06:37.110 --> 06:06:37.120 align:start position:0%
an account at an an in an insured uh
 
06:06:39.310 --> 06:06:39.320 align:start position:0%
depository institution and they can
 
06:06:41.390 --> 06:06:41.400 align:start position:0%
process those payments and quite often
 
06:06:43.030 --> 06:06:43.040 align:start position:0%
the the Federal Reserve is going to be
 
06:06:44.910 --> 06:06:44.920 align:start position:0%
through the automated Clearing House is
 
06:06:46.590 --> 06:06:46.600 align:start position:0%
going to be really just that Central
 
06:06:48.430 --> 06:06:48.440 align:start position:0%
facility that that that allows that to
 
06:06:50.510 --> 06:06:50.520 align:start position:0%
happen so that's called the master
 
06:06:50.520 --> 06:06:52.030 align:start position:0%
happen so that's called the master
account

06:06:52.030 --> 06:06:52.040 align:start position:0%
account
 
06:06:54.468 --> 06:06:54.478 align:start position:0%
right I I wanted to just add one other
 
06:06:56.110 --> 06:06:56.120 align:start position:0%
thing relative to the application and
 
06:06:57.910 --> 06:06:57.920 align:start position:0%
this is an important element so
 
06:07:00.190 --> 06:07:00.200 align:start position:0%
commissioner galeri talked about the
 
06:07:02.468 --> 06:07:02.478 align:start position:0%
likely uh initial capitalization
 
06:07:05.030 --> 06:07:05.040 align:start position:0%
required for a depository institution
 
06:07:06.868 --> 06:07:06.878 align:start position:0%
from the standpoint of uh from banking
 
06:07:09.830 --> 06:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
Regulators uh federal and state capital
 
06:07:12.150 --> 06:07:12.160 align:start position:0%
is absolutely important and we've heard
 
06:07:14.628 --> 06:07:14.638 align:start position:0%
previous uh testimony this afternoon
 
06:07:16.230 --> 06:07:16.240 align:start position:0%
about you know what that is whether it's
 
06:07:18.708 --> 06:07:18.718 align:start position:0%
Capital ratios net worth ratios the
 
06:07:21.430 --> 06:07:21.440 align:start position:0%
reality is those ratios um have to be
 
06:07:23.310 --> 06:07:23.320 align:start position:0%
maintained at a certain level per the
 
06:07:25.390 --> 06:07:25.400 align:start position:0%
federal statutes and as that
 
06:07:27.628 --> 06:07:27.638 align:start position:0%
organization grows as the the assets and
 
06:07:29.230 --> 06:07:29.240 align:start position:0%
then the underlying liabilities the
 
06:07:31.468 --> 06:07:31.478 align:start position:0%
deposits of that organization grows
 
06:07:33.310 --> 06:07:33.320 align:start position:0%
there would be an expectation that
 
06:07:35.070 --> 06:07:35.080 align:start position:0%
additional Capital would be there to
 
06:07:37.190 --> 06:07:37.200 align:start position:0%
maintain those important Capital uh
 
06:07:40.270 --> 06:07:40.280 align:start position:0%
capital and net worth measures capitals
 
06:07:41.670 --> 06:07:41.680 align:start position:0%
as you know I'm talking to the house
 
06:07:44.590 --> 06:07:44.600 align:start position:0%
Ways and Means here so it's it's capital
 
06:07:47.468 --> 06:07:47.478 align:start position:0%
is a Ultra imperative to absorb it's a
 
06:07:49.830 --> 06:07:49.840 align:start position:0%
to a cushion to absorb losses it can
 
06:07:53.030 --> 06:07:53.040 align:start position:0%
margin growth and the The Regulators
 
06:07:54.270 --> 06:07:54.280 align:start position:0%
this is these are very important
 
06:07:56.350 --> 06:07:56.360 align:start position:0%
measures and I want to also mention from
 
06:07:59.390 --> 06:07:59.400 align:start position:0%
the standpoint of the application uh the
 
06:08:02.910 --> 06:08:02.920 align:start position:0%
FDIC has been very clear as they process
 
06:08:04.868 --> 06:08:04.878 align:start position:0%
and as they look at applications for
 
06:08:06.468 --> 06:08:06.478 align:start position:0%
Deposit Insurance for what's known as a
 
06:08:09.750 --> 06:08:09.760 align:start position:0%
new a denovo depository bank they want
 
06:08:12.150 --> 06:08:12.160 align:start position:0%
to see profitability from that bank
 
06:08:14.670 --> 06:08:14.680 align:start position:0%
within the first three years and so if
 
06:08:15.948 --> 06:08:15.958 align:start position:0%
there's and there's got to be very
 
06:08:17.910 --> 06:08:17.920 align:start position:0%
detailed Financial projections that get
 
06:08:21.150 --> 06:08:21.160 align:start position:0%
reviewed very closely by uh by the by
 
06:08:23.548 --> 06:08:23.558 align:start position:0%
those approving Regulators uh if if
 
06:08:25.230 --> 06:08:25.240 align:start position:0%
those financials aren't there to show
 
06:08:27.990 --> 06:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
profitability within three years it it's
 
06:08:31.070 --> 06:08:31.080 align:start position:0%
pretty much a fatal a fatal
 
06:08:33.590 --> 06:08:33.600 align:start position:0%
scenario and I think just to add on to
 
06:08:35.708 --> 06:08:35.718 align:start position:0%
that one thing that like and I think the
 
06:08:37.708 --> 06:08:37.718 align:start position:0%
California study that you guys have does
 
06:08:39.788 --> 06:08:39.798 align:start position:0%
do a very good job of explaining this
 
06:08:42.270 --> 06:08:42.280 align:start position:0%
basically any change in the federal
 
06:08:45.110 --> 06:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
landscape will potentially tank this you
 
06:08:46.948 --> 06:08:46.958 align:start position:0%
know so if the feds if the federal
 
06:08:48.670 --> 06:08:48.680 align:start position:0%
government makes this legal you won't
 
06:08:50.910 --> 06:08:50.920 align:start position:0%
need a State Bank anymore right so then
 
06:08:52.590 --> 06:08:52.600 align:start position:0%
the State Bank goes out of business and
 
06:08:54.430 --> 06:08:54.440 align:start position:0%
all the money that you've invested is
 
06:08:57.390 --> 06:08:57.400 align:start position:0%
gone um but if they suddenly change and
 
06:09:01.510 --> 06:09:01.520 align:start position:0%
start Prosecuting the this situation um
 
06:09:04.150 --> 06:09:04.160 align:start position:0%
same same scenario the the bank that
 
06:09:05.868 --> 06:09:05.878 align:start position:0%
you've just created is is out of
 
06:09:08.390 --> 06:09:08.400 align:start position:0%
business um so it is a pretty risky
 
06:09:11.070 --> 06:09:11.080 align:start position:0%
Endeavor to um start a public bank and
 
06:09:14.150 --> 06:09:14.160 align:start position:0%
should not be taken lightly
 
06:09:14.160 --> 06:09:16.590 align:start position:0%
should not be taken lightly
um

06:09:16.590 --> 06:09:16.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:09:19.190 --> 06:09:19.200 align:start position:0%
uh another another issue that I just
 
06:09:20.910 --> 06:09:20.920 align:start position:0%
wanted to flag for everyone that is very
 
06:09:25.468 --> 06:09:25.478 align:start position:0%
unique to this bill um so the AG is
 
06:09:26.750 --> 06:09:26.760 align:start position:0%
going to be on the board I believe
 
06:09:29.390 --> 06:09:29.400 align:start position:0%
believe and also um everyone who works
 
06:09:31.868 --> 06:09:31.878 align:start position:0%
for the State Bank is indemnified and
 
06:09:33.590 --> 06:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
will be represented by the doj in the
 
06:09:36.510 --> 06:09:36.520 align:start position:0%
offense that something goes wrong um one
 
06:09:38.270 --> 06:09:38.280 align:start position:0%
of the things that could potentially go
 
06:09:39.708 --> 06:09:39.718 align:start position:0%
wrong is the banking Department could
 
06:09:41.270 --> 06:09:41.280 align:start position:0%
bring in enforcement action if we're
 
06:09:44.708 --> 06:09:44.718 align:start position:0%
going to be the regulator um so we'd be
 
06:09:47.868 --> 06:09:47.878 align:start position:0%
um but the doj also represents us I
 
06:09:49.070 --> 06:09:49.080 align:start position:0%
don't think there's anyone here from the
 
06:09:51.590 --> 06:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
doj but that's a cost coming at you from
 
06:09:54.350 --> 06:09:54.360 align:start position:0%
both sides um that I don't think we were
 
06:09:58.270 --> 06:09:58.280 align:start position:0%
quite sure how to um C in a fiscal note
 
06:10:01.150 --> 06:10:01.160 align:start position:0%
um it would be like the state bringing
 
06:10:02.628 --> 06:10:02.638 align:start position:0%
enforcement action against the state
 
06:10:05.510 --> 06:10:05.520 align:start position:0%
being defended by the state um so that's
 
06:10:07.468 --> 06:10:07.478 align:start position:0%
kind of a an interesting little uh
 
06:10:08.990 --> 06:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
conundrum that I just wanted to
 
06:10:10.910 --> 06:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
highlight for everyone um that's a
 
06:10:15.590 --> 06:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
little unusual um very so I we're happy
 
06:10:17.070 --> 06:10:17.080 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions anyone might
 
06:10:18.350 --> 06:10:18.360 align:start position:0%
have I think that's
 
06:10:25.628 --> 06:10:25.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:25.638 --> 06:10:34.750 align:start position:0%
 
hunt

06:10:34.750 --> 06:10:34.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:36.868 --> 06:10:36.878 align:start position:0%
unencumbered sitting sitting there
 
06:10:39.590 --> 06:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
waiting waiting for for it to be burned
 
06:10:41.430 --> 06:10:41.440 align:start position:0%
away um because there's going to be
 
06:10:43.390 --> 06:10:43.400 align:start position:0%
that's like they talk about Todd can
 
06:10:44.390 --> 06:10:44.400 align:start position:0%
probably speak this a little bit we
 
06:10:45.990 --> 06:10:46.000 align:start position:0%
expect to see a capital burn when a bank
 
06:10:48.548 --> 06:10:48.558 align:start position:0%
is first started up and it's to cushion
 
06:10:50.230 --> 06:10:50.240 align:start position:0%
that burn you're paying for employees
 
06:10:53.868 --> 06:10:53.878 align:start position:0%
you're paying for all sorts of stuff um
 
06:10:56.070 --> 06:10:56.080 align:start position:0%
and in fact so what we do is we as the
 
06:10:58.628 --> 06:10:58.638 align:start position:0%
chartering Authority in New Hampshire we
 
06:11:01.628 --> 06:11:01.638 align:start position:0%
accept the the applicants application to
 
06:11:04.230 --> 06:11:04.240 align:start position:0%
the FDIC for Deposit Insurance we accept
 
06:11:06.310 --> 06:11:06.320 align:start position:0%
that as they say the application for a
 
06:11:07.830 --> 06:11:07.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire chart or for a denova
 
06:11:10.310 --> 06:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
depository bank I know that just from
 
06:11:11.990 --> 06:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
experience one of the very specific
 
06:11:14.948 --> 06:11:14.958 align:start position:0%
questions in that FDIC application is to
 
06:11:17.788 --> 06:11:17.798 align:start position:0%
to inquire of the applicant is any of
 
06:11:20.590 --> 06:11:20.600 align:start position:0%
those initial capitalization funds were
 
06:11:23.110 --> 06:11:23.120 align:start position:0%
they loan from elsewhere does the app
 
06:11:25.190 --> 06:11:25.200 align:start position:0%
did the applicant borrow those funds so
 
06:11:26.788 --> 06:11:26.798 align:start position:0%
that's something that's a very specific
 
06:11:30.590 --> 06:11:30.600 align:start position:0%
fact element Andor and as we maybe you
 
06:11:33.548 --> 06:11:33.558 align:start position:0%
can push it back just do the trick um as
 
06:11:35.510 --> 06:11:35.520 align:start position:0%
as we said earlier I think 20 million is
 
06:11:37.708 --> 06:11:37.718 align:start position:0%
probably not going to cut it so um it's
 
06:11:40.430 --> 06:11:40.440 align:start position:0%
going to be significantly more than
 
06:11:42.990 --> 06:11:43.000 align:start position:0%
that okay uh representative spillsbury
 
06:11:46.150 --> 06:11:46.160 align:start position:0%
followed by representative Bry thank you
 
06:11:50.150 --> 06:11:50.160 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman yeah I your comment about
 
06:11:54.350 --> 06:11:54.360 align:start position:0%
the um the board of directors um was
 
06:11:56.270 --> 06:11:56.280 align:start position:0%
something I was going to hit there's
 
06:11:57.430 --> 06:11:57.440 align:start position:0%
only three
 
06:12:00.190 --> 06:12:00.200 align:start position:0%
individuals and uh the conflicts and
 
06:12:03.270 --> 06:12:03.280 align:start position:0%
entanglements are inseparable uh which
 
06:12:05.110 --> 06:12:05.120 align:start position:0%
takes me back to other language that had
 
06:12:07.830 --> 06:12:07.840 align:start position:0%
me scratching my head on page
 
06:12:12.030 --> 06:12:12.040 align:start position:0%
10 uh in lines 19 through 25 there are
 
06:12:12.040 --> 06:12:13.110 align:start position:0%
10 uh in lines 19 through 25 there are
two

06:12:13.110 --> 06:12:13.120 align:start position:0%
two
 
06:12:16.548 --> 06:12:16.558 align:start position:0%
sentences that I think I I can't exactly
 
06:12:21.070 --> 06:12:21.080 align:start position:0%
reconcile them but I think they
 
06:12:24.868 --> 06:12:24.878 align:start position:0%
illustrate the public private tension uh
 
06:12:27.788 --> 06:12:27.798 align:start position:0%
in creating a Public state-owned public
 
06:12:30.468 --> 06:12:30.478 align:start position:0%
Bank the single purpose depository Bank
 
06:12:33.750 --> 06:12:33.760 align:start position:0%
shall be created as a body corporate and
 
06:12:36.310 --> 06:12:36.320 align:start position:0%
politic having a distinct legal
 
06:12:39.310 --> 06:12:39.320 align:start position:0%
existence separate from the state and
 
06:12:41.390 --> 06:12:41.400 align:start position:0%
not constituting a department of state
 
06:12:43.110 --> 06:12:43.120 align:start position:0%
government having the powers and
 
06:12:45.230 --> 06:12:45.240 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions etc etc and then the next
 
06:12:47.868 --> 06:12:47.878 align:start position:0%
sentence goes on to say that it shall be
 
06:12:50.990 --> 06:12:51.000 align:start position:0%
deemed uh and held to be the performance
 
06:12:52.708 --> 06:12:52.718 align:start position:0%
of public and essential governmental
 
06:12:55.590 --> 06:12:55.600 align:start position:0%
functions of the state and uh you know
 
06:12:57.910 --> 06:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
somebody might be a explain it to me but
 
06:13:01.670 --> 06:13:01.680 align:start position:0%
that just sounds like um there is no
 
06:13:05.708 --> 06:13:05.718 align:start position:0%
distinct separation between control and
 
06:13:07.830 --> 06:13:07.840 align:start position:0%
operation yeah and I that's why I wanted
 
06:13:10.030 --> 06:13:10.040 align:start position:0%
to point out the the line um and I'm
 
06:13:11.150 --> 06:13:11.160 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm not going to find it very
 
06:13:12.390 --> 06:13:12.400 align:start position:0%
quickly but the one about
 
06:13:15.230 --> 06:13:15.240 align:start position:0%
indemnification in RSA 99d um because
 
06:13:16.788 --> 06:13:16.798 align:start position:0%
that's basically if you're a state
 
06:13:20.590 --> 06:13:20.600 align:start position:0%
employee um and the doj would be better
 
06:13:23.030 --> 06:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
to explain that comes up on page 11 uh
 
06:13:27.350 --> 06:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
down on lines uh 16 through 19 yeah the
 
06:13:30.990 --> 06:13:31.000 align:start position:0%
the and I'm I don't want to say it
 
06:13:33.350 --> 06:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
incorrectly but my high level kind of
 
06:13:35.070 --> 06:13:35.080 align:start position:0%
understanding as a state employe is the
 
06:13:38.150 --> 06:13:38.160 align:start position:0%
doj will represent us um in certain
 
06:13:41.628 --> 06:13:41.638 align:start position:0%
scenarios and um our actions are sort of
 
06:13:43.910 --> 06:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
indemnified I'm probably misstating that
 
06:13:45.670 --> 06:13:45.680 align:start position:0%
because I'm not the expert in it um
 
06:13:47.990 --> 06:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
luckily I've not been sued too many
 
06:13:50.110 --> 06:13:50.120 align:start position:0%
times so I don't have to know about it
 
06:13:52.990 --> 06:13:53.000 align:start position:0%
um but that is a conflict there it seems
 
06:13:54.990 --> 06:13:55.000 align:start position:0%
to be that they're expecting this
 
06:13:56.830 --> 06:13:56.840 align:start position:0%
employees of the State Bank to sort of
 
06:14:00.590 --> 06:14:00.600 align:start position:0%
be state employees sort of um but then
 
06:14:01.868 --> 06:14:01.878 align:start position:0%
that sentence I don't know there's
 
06:14:03.468 --> 06:14:03.478 align:start position:0%
something I don't know quite how to
 
06:14:06.510 --> 06:14:06.520 align:start position:0%
reconcile that representative
 
06:14:09.548 --> 06:14:09.558 align:start position:0%
Bry I just want to say hello to Mr Wells
 
06:14:11.830 --> 06:14:11.840 align:start position:0%
who was uh on the commission marijuana
 
06:14:14.430 --> 06:14:14.440 align:start position:0%
commission several years ago on this
 
06:14:16.788 --> 06:14:16.798 align:start position:0%
when we were looking at at legalization
 
06:14:19.868 --> 06:14:19.878 align:start position:0%
back then um but you're you're here
 
06:14:22.110 --> 06:14:22.120 align:start position:0%
because this is a this is going to be a
 
06:14:24.750 --> 06:14:24.760 align:start position:0%
uh a state charted bank now if this was
 
06:14:27.310 --> 06:14:27.320 align:start position:0%
going to be well do you do you cover
 
06:14:29.548 --> 06:14:29.558 align:start position:0%
federal chared banks as well no just
 
06:14:34.070 --> 06:14:34.080 align:start position:0%
State Banks correct and uh of your
 
06:14:36.468 --> 06:14:36.478 align:start position:0%
members I thought I thought I heard that
 
06:14:39.110 --> 06:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
none of your members within not members
 
06:14:40.468 --> 06:14:40.478 align:start position:0%
you know in that umbrella of State
 
06:14:41.948 --> 06:14:41.958 align:start position:0%
charted banks are there any that are
 
06:14:44.990 --> 06:14:45.000 align:start position:0%
interested in uh in banking I know way
 
06:14:48.030 --> 06:14:48.040 align:start position:0%
back when the answer was no banking uh
 
06:14:50.468 --> 06:14:50.478 align:start position:0%
cannabis right I will tell you I have
 
06:14:52.548 --> 06:14:52.558 align:start position:0%
not had that specific discussion yet
 
06:14:54.510 --> 06:14:54.520 align:start position:0%
with any of our institutions and and as
 
06:14:55.990 --> 06:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
was alluded to earlier that would be a
 
06:14:58.070 --> 06:14:58.080 align:start position:0%
bit business decision by those New
 
06:14:59.350 --> 06:14:59.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire chartered Banks or credit
 
06:15:02.468 --> 06:15:02.478 align:start position:0%
unions uh I think I think it's very
 
06:15:04.708 --> 06:15:04.718 align:start position:0%
likely it's possible that some of those
 
06:15:07.070 --> 06:15:07.080 align:start position:0%
would be out there what I deal with is
 
06:15:09.788 --> 06:15:09.798 align:start position:0%
is the here and now and what what I you
 
06:15:12.430 --> 06:15:12.440 align:start position:0%
know per my understanding of the New
 
06:15:13.750 --> 06:15:13.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire chartered Banks currently we
 
06:15:15.510 --> 06:15:15.520 align:start position:0%
have 16 and of the nine New Hampshire
 
06:15:18.190 --> 06:15:18.200 align:start position:0%
Charter Credit Unions none of them are
 
06:15:19.910 --> 06:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
actively banking what would be known as
 
06:15:22.390 --> 06:15:22.400 align:start position:0%
marijana related businesses now I just I
 
06:15:24.948 --> 06:15:24.958 align:start position:0%
I want to say that the term I I agree
 
06:15:27.030 --> 06:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
the term should probably be can abis but
 
06:15:28.788 --> 06:15:28.798 align:start position:0%
from the standpoint of uh state and
 
06:15:31.310 --> 06:15:31.320 align:start position:0%
federal Regulators one of the the big
 
06:15:33.350 --> 06:15:33.360 align:start position:0%
elements the big focal points of the
 
06:15:35.548 --> 06:15:35.558 align:start position:0%
examiners as they look at these programs
 
06:15:37.868 --> 06:15:37.878 align:start position:0%
of those institutions they go back we've
 
06:15:40.310 --> 06:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
heard finsen was issued referenced
 
06:15:41.948 --> 06:15:41.958 align:start position:0%
earlier the financial crimes enforcement
 
06:15:44.110 --> 06:15:44.120 align:start position:0%
Network they have guidance out there
 
06:15:46.190 --> 06:15:46.200 align:start position:0%
that that currently uh is very
 
06:15:48.990 --> 06:15:49.000 align:start position:0%
reflective of the Cole memo that had
 
06:15:50.910 --> 06:15:50.920 align:start position:0%
been issued under the the uh New
 
06:15:52.270 --> 06:15:52.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department or excuse me the
 
06:15:55.110 --> 06:15:55.120 align:start position:0%
the US Department of Justice and so the
 
06:15:56.708 --> 06:15:56.718 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
06:15:59.230 --> 06:15:59.240 align:start position:0%
pretty much permeating the uh the the
 
06:16:00.948 --> 06:16:00.958 align:start position:0%
bank speak from The Regulators and the
 
06:16:02.390 --> 06:16:02.400 align:start position:0%
law enforcement is they talk about
 
06:16:04.270 --> 06:16:04.280 align:start position:0%
marijuana marijuana related businesses
 
06:16:06.390 --> 06:16:06.400 align:start position:0%
suspicious activity reports and then
 
06:16:08.510 --> 06:16:08.520 align:start position:0%
there's marijuana limited marijuana
 
06:16:10.830 --> 06:16:10.840 align:start position:0%
priority and marijuana termination
 
06:16:12.670 --> 06:16:12.680 align:start position:0%
reports that are issued as part of those
 
06:16:19.430 --> 06:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:24.830 --> 06:16:24.840 align:start position:0%
reports uh representa Aaron thank you Mr
 
06:16:26.468 --> 06:16:26.478 align:start position:0%
chair thank you thank you for your
 
06:16:29.868 --> 06:16:29.878 align:start position:0%
testimony today so if I understand you
 
06:16:35.110 --> 06:16:35.120 align:start position:0%
would be seeking to have um line 10 from
 
06:16:39.110 --> 06:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
page 10 all the way to line
 
06:16:45.390 --> 06:16:45.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:49.350 --> 06:16:49.360 align:start position:0%
out um that's line 10 of page 10 all the
 
06:16:54.110 --> 06:16:54.120 align:start position:0%
way to line 19 of page 11 well so we're
 
06:16:56.230 --> 06:16:56.240 align:start position:0%
not taking a position on the policy if
 
06:16:59.230 --> 06:16:59.240 align:start position:0%
the state were to decide despite I you
 
06:17:00.990 --> 06:17:01.000 align:start position:0%
know obviously there are public Banks
 
06:17:03.590 --> 06:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
out there there's two in existence um
 
06:17:05.430 --> 06:17:05.440 align:start position:0%
under very different circumstances than
 
06:17:06.990 --> 06:17:07.000 align:start position:0%
what's being discussed so I think that's
 
06:17:08.670 --> 06:17:08.680 align:start position:0%
a policy decision of the state whether
 
06:17:12.030 --> 06:17:12.040 align:start position:0%
or not to establish a State Bank um all
 
06:17:13.350 --> 06:17:13.360 align:start position:0%
we're testifying to is that there's
 
06:17:14.910 --> 06:17:14.920 align:start position:0%
significant problems with how this is
 
06:17:17.350 --> 06:17:17.360 align:start position:0%
drafted um and if the state were to do
 
06:17:19.030 --> 06:17:19.040 align:start position:0%
this it would have to probably look
 
06:17:21.948 --> 06:17:21.958 align:start position:0%
significantly different from this um to
 
06:17:24.948 --> 06:17:24.958 align:start position:0%
make it work if it was even workable
 
06:17:27.270 --> 06:17:27.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:17:27.280 --> 06:17:28.948 align:start position:0%
thank you
further

06:17:28.948 --> 06:17:28.958 align:start position:0%
further
 
06:17:33.270 --> 06:17:33.280 align:start position:0%
questions saying none thank you thank
 
06:17:35.190 --> 06:17:35.200 align:start position:0%
you next
 
06:17:38.548 --> 06:17:38.558 align:start position:0%

we wanted to show you what it was like
 
06:18:03.948 --> 06:18:03.958 align:start position:0%
without the THC in it so this is this is
 
06:18:09.110 --> 06:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
what we sell uh with THC in it uh to uh

you'd be buying in a store with THC in
 
06:18:51.150 --> 06:18:51.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:54.830 --> 06:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:54.840 --> 06:18:58.868 align:start position:0%
 
child

06:18:58.868 --> 06:18:58.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:01.750 --> 06:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
those are gummies and we sell them
 
06:19:04.190 --> 06:19:04.200 align:start position:0%
mostly to believe it or not to people
 
06:19:06.150 --> 06:19:06.160 align:start position:0%
over 50
 
06:19:11.468 --> 06:19:11.478 align:start position:0%
sleep um we'd also I you guys could pass
 
06:19:11.478 --> 06:19:14.310 align:start position:0%
sleep um we'd also I you guys could pass
these

06:19:14.310 --> 06:19:14.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:17.628 --> 06:19:17.638 align:start position:0%
around talking out in the middle in a
 
06:19:20.750 --> 06:19:20.760 align:start position:0%
minute okay and uh just wanted to show
 
06:19:23.150 --> 06:19:23.160 align:start position:0%
you we're so we're a we're a vertically
 
06:19:25.830 --> 06:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
integrated cannabis business we have
 
06:19:28.990 --> 06:19:29.000 align:start position:0%
60,000 Square ft of cultivation licenses
 
06:19:31.390 --> 06:19:31.400 align:start position:0%
so any of the questions you want to an
 
06:19:34.030 --> 06:19:34.040 align:start position:0%
ask about cultivation after or anything
 
06:19:36.270 --> 06:19:36.280 align:start position:0%
else the stuff everybody's been talking
 
06:19:38.750 --> 06:19:38.760 align:start position:0%
about that the medical people there and
 
06:19:40.510 --> 06:19:40.520 align:start position:0%
the adult juice cannabis people here
 
06:19:42.190 --> 06:19:42.200 align:start position:0%
we're cringing when we're listening to
 
06:19:46.070 --> 06:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
this because it it's it's so far from
 
06:19:47.788 --> 06:19:47.798 align:start position:0%
what the real business is like that
 
06:19:50.030 --> 06:19:50.040 align:start position:0%
we're we've actually done it uh we were
 
06:19:52.030 --> 06:19:52.040 align:start position:0%
on the uh if anybody's interested we
 
06:19:53.628 --> 06:19:53.638 align:start position:0%
were on the cover of the Portsmouth
 
06:19:56.628 --> 06:19:56.638 align:start position:0%
Herald February 3rd last thir Thursday
 
06:20:00.070 --> 06:20:00.080 align:start position:0%
with our business and uh you know well I
 
06:20:03.430 --> 06:20:03.440 align:start position:0%
will uh I'll stick to my I'll read the
 
06:20:07.510 --> 06:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
testimony and uh myself and and uh Ryan
 
06:20:09.510 --> 06:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
here is also a partner of mine in East
 
06:20:12.190 --> 06:20:12.200 align:start position:0%
Coast cannabis he's one of the founders
 
06:20:15.190 --> 06:20:15.200 align:start position:0%
so anyhow we will restrict Our Testimony
 
06:20:17.708 --> 06:20:17.718 align:start position:0%
in ways and means to financial matters
 
06:20:19.590 --> 06:20:19.600 align:start position:0%
in the bill and structural and legal
 
06:20:21.670 --> 06:20:21.680 align:start position:0%
problems to assess risk and
 
06:20:23.510 --> 06:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
profitability or loss if this bill were
 
06:20:26.390 --> 06:20:26.400 align:start position:0%
to pass everyone mistaka believes the
 
06:20:28.670 --> 06:20:28.680 align:start position:0%
Cannabis industry is a gold rush
 
06:20:30.190 --> 06:20:30.200 align:start position:0%
evidently the state of New Hampshire
 
06:20:32.468 --> 06:20:32.478 align:start position:0%
agrees by considering this bill let's
 
06:20:34.430 --> 06:20:34.440 align:start position:0%
start by looking at the stock history of
 
06:20:36.030 --> 06:20:36.040 align:start position:0%
the biggest players in the Cannabis
 
06:20:38.708 --> 06:20:38.718 align:start position:0%
business over the last few years canopy
 
06:20:40.788 --> 06:20:40.798 align:start position:0%
Holdings in Canada which we've talked
 
06:20:42.910 --> 06:20:42.920 align:start position:0%
about Canada the largest cannabis
 
06:20:45.270 --> 06:20:45.280 align:start position:0%
company in the world their stock is off
 
06:20:49.150 --> 06:20:49.160 align:start position:0%
by 85% from highs acreage Holdings one
 
06:20:51.150 --> 06:20:51.160 align:start position:0%
of the larges cannabis companies in the
 
06:20:54.310 --> 06:20:54.320 align:start position:0%
US their stock price is off almost 80%
 
06:20:57.590 --> 06:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
of highs Mary advisers another very big
 
06:20:59.628 --> 06:20:59.638 align:start position:0%
cannabis company headquartered in
 
06:21:02.468 --> 06:21:02.478 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts was trading just over $5 a
 
06:21:04.590 --> 06:21:04.600 align:start position:0%
share at its highest point and is now
 
06:21:07.310 --> 06:21:07.320 align:start position:0%
somewhere around 74 cents fluctu dayto
 
06:21:08.590 --> 06:21:08.600 align:start position:0%
day losing
 
06:21:11.230 --> 06:21:11.240 align:start position:0%
85% something to consider before jumping
 
06:21:12.990 --> 06:21:13.000 align:start position:0%
into investing many millions of New
 
06:21:15.350 --> 06:21:15.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire taxpayer money into a risky
 
06:21:18.150 --> 06:21:18.160 align:start position:0%
State Venture we will identify just a
 
06:21:21.830 --> 06:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
few issues in HB 1598 that make it
 
06:21:23.868 --> 06:21:23.878 align:start position:0%
unsupportable and believe me there's
 
06:21:26.750 --> 06:21:26.760 align:start position:0%
many more structurally in the Cannabis
 
06:21:28.830 --> 06:21:28.840 align:start position:0%
industry the model submitted in this
 
06:21:31.750 --> 06:21:31.760 align:start position:0%
bill simply won't work not just the fact
 
06:21:33.590 --> 06:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
it will be challenging to make a profit
 
06:21:36.150 --> 06:21:36.160 align:start position:0%
for the state but worse the supply chain
 
06:21:39.670 --> 06:21:39.680 align:start position:0%
of products won't work here's why the
 
06:21:42.590 --> 06:21:42.600 align:start position:0%
bill proposes 15 private licensed State
 
06:21:44.628 --> 06:21:44.638 align:start position:0%
cannabis cultiv to grow the Cannabis
 
06:21:47.510 --> 06:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
products for 10 State Stores I have
 
06:21:49.628 --> 06:21:49.638 align:start position:0%
spoken with six successful commercial
 
06:21:51.708 --> 06:21:51.718 align:start position:0%
cannabis cultivators in Maine and
 
06:21:54.390 --> 06:21:54.400 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts including our company some
 
06:21:56.708 --> 06:21:56.718 align:start position:0%
of the biggest ones in the industry but
 
06:21:58.868 --> 06:21:58.878 align:start position:0%
not one of us would accept a contract to
 
06:22:00.190 --> 06:22:00.200 align:start position:0%
cultivate with the state of New
 
06:22:02.270 --> 06:22:02.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire under this bill unless the
 
06:22:04.628 --> 06:22:04.638 align:start position:0%
state agreed to buy our entire crop
 
06:22:06.270 --> 06:22:06.280 align:start position:0%
regardless if the state stores are
 
06:22:08.468 --> 06:22:08.478 align:start position:0%
overstocked or the state buyer doesn't
 
06:22:10.830 --> 06:22:10.840 align:start position:0%
want the product or for any other reason
 
06:22:13.030 --> 06:22:13.040 align:start position:0%
we cannot grow expensive crops for the
 
06:22:15.110 --> 06:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
state that if the state buyer doesn't
 
06:22:18.150 --> 06:22:18.160 align:start position:0%
want to buy those crops for any reason
 
06:22:20.110 --> 06:22:20.120 align:start position:0%
we will have to pay to destroy what we
 
06:22:22.350 --> 06:22:22.360 align:start position:0%
just paid a million dollars to grow
 
06:22:24.548 --> 06:22:24.558 align:start position:0%
since the state is the only buyer we
 
06:22:26.270 --> 06:22:26.280 align:start position:0%
would spend Millions to set up
 
06:22:28.430 --> 06:22:28.440 align:start position:0%
cultivation businesses for State for the
 
06:22:31.270 --> 06:22:31.280 align:start position:0%
state only to have potentially destroy
 
06:22:34.230 --> 06:22:34.240 align:start position:0%
what you just spent Millions to grow no
 
06:22:37.030 --> 06:22:37.040 align:start position:0%
one would do that but on the other hand
 
06:22:39.230 --> 06:22:39.240 align:start position:0%
if the state agrees to buy all products
 
06:22:40.990 --> 06:22:41.000 align:start position:0%
grown they will be the ones with
 
06:22:43.150 --> 06:22:43.160 align:start position:0%
millions and spoiled crops they have to
 
06:22:45.948 --> 06:22:45.958 align:start position:0%
pay to destroy this is a vegetable it
 
06:22:48.590 --> 06:22:48.600 align:start position:0%
spoils which of course will bankrupt the
 
06:22:51.230 --> 06:22:51.240 align:start position:0%
entire program also what a cannabis
 
06:22:53.788 --> 06:22:53.798 align:start position:0%
cultivation gets paid for their product
 
06:22:56.430 --> 06:22:56.440 align:start position:0%
and what sets the market price is state
 
06:22:59.070 --> 06:22:59.080 align:start position:0%
by state and prices are determined by
 
06:23:01.830 --> 06:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
state supply and demand and two-way
 
06:23:03.948 --> 06:23:03.958 align:start position:0%
negotiations between countless buyers
 
06:23:06.190 --> 06:23:06.200 align:start position:0%
and sellers just like the Liquor
 
06:23:08.708 --> 06:23:08.718 align:start position:0%
Commission buys all of their liquor but
 
06:23:11.590 --> 06:23:11.600 align:start position:0%
this bill instead proposes proposes a
 
06:23:14.390 --> 06:23:14.400 align:start position:0%
single state approved buyer to negotiate
 
06:23:17.030 --> 06:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
and set State buying prices for any and
 
06:23:19.430 --> 06:23:19.440 align:start position:0%
all qualities of product the model is
 
06:23:21.948 --> 06:23:21.958 align:start position:0%
untenable to the cultivator since the
 
06:23:24.150 --> 06:23:24.160 align:start position:0%
fate of their expensive crop and the
 
06:23:25.788 --> 06:23:25.798 align:start position:0%
price and terms are going to to be
 
06:23:28.230 --> 06:23:28.240 align:start position:0%
dictated by their only state buyer who
 
06:23:29.948 --> 06:23:29.958 align:start position:0%
also controls the renewal of their
 
06:23:33.430 --> 06:23:33.440 align:start position:0%
license that is no way a free an open
 
06:23:35.868 --> 06:23:35.878 align:start position:0%
market and won't work in a free and open
 
06:23:38.910 --> 06:23:38.920 align:start position:0%
market the next issue in this bill only
 
06:23:41.310 --> 06:23:41.320 align:start position:0%
allows cannabis flow to be old sold at
 
06:23:44.030 --> 06:23:44.040 align:start position:0%
the stores like we've covered before but
 
06:23:46.390 --> 06:23:46.400 align:start position:0%
cannabis and fuse products which won't
 
06:23:48.990 --> 06:23:49.000 align:start position:0%
be legal for adult use represent about
 
06:23:52.030 --> 06:23:52.040 align:start position:0%
half of adult youth retail sales just so
 
06:23:54.868 --> 06:23:54.878 align:start position:0%
everyone knows in our store that's 45
 
06:23:57.750 --> 06:23:57.760 align:start position:0%
minutes from here we sell 50% cannabis
 
06:23:59.670 --> 06:23:59.680 align:start position:0%
infused products now you might wonder
 
06:24:01.910 --> 06:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
where they come I'm getting to that it
 
06:24:04.468 --> 06:24:04.478 align:start position:0%
is like selling is like having a bar
 
06:24:06.510 --> 06:24:06.520 align:start position:0%
that doesn't sell beer that's what this
 
06:24:09.468 --> 06:24:09.478 align:start position:0%
this bill's about worse cannabis plant
 
06:24:12.430 --> 06:24:12.440 align:start position:0%
trim and substandard cannabis flour
 
06:24:14.788 --> 06:24:14.798 align:start position:0%
which is very expensive to produce have
 
06:24:17.030 --> 06:24:17.040 align:start position:0%
their oils extracted and made into
 
06:24:19.548 --> 06:24:19.558 align:start position:0%
cannabis infused product this accounts
 
06:24:22.070 --> 06:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
again for 50% of cannabis products sold
 
06:24:24.830 --> 06:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
in retail stores a large about quart
 
06:24:25.910 --> 06:24:25.920 align:start position:0%
siiz job
 
06:24:28.990 --> 06:24:29.000 align:start position:0%
of cannabis oil is worth $10,000 so you
 
06:24:31.990 --> 06:24:32.000 align:start position:0%
have an idea but this bill specifically
 
06:24:34.070 --> 06:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
excludes the legalization of infused
 
06:24:35.910 --> 06:24:35.920 align:start position:0%
cannabis products to the adult use
 
06:24:38.788 --> 06:24:38.798 align:start position:0%
Market thereby robbing the state stores
 
06:24:41.430 --> 06:24:41.440 align:start position:0%
of 50% of their gross sales and
 
06:24:43.708 --> 06:24:43.718 align:start position:0%
bankrupting all the cultivators because
 
06:24:45.750 --> 06:24:45.760 align:start position:0%
the most expensive product that they
 
06:24:48.350 --> 06:24:48.360 align:start position:0%
produce that makes up 50% of cannabis
 
06:24:50.910 --> 06:24:50.920 align:start position:0%
products sold in retail stores will have
 
06:24:52.788 --> 06:24:52.798 align:start position:0%
to be paid to get destroyed by the
 
06:24:55.590 --> 06:24:55.600 align:start position:0%
cultivator because it is illegal to sell
 
06:24:58.430 --> 06:24:58.440 align:start position:0%
except to the state under this program
 
06:25:00.390 --> 06:25:00.400 align:start position:0%
something the Bill's author nor the
 
06:25:03.430 --> 06:25:03.440 align:start position:0%
state was even aware of I am sure
 
06:25:06.310 --> 06:25:06.320 align:start position:0%
regarding legal matters I wrote to repa
 
06:25:09.390 --> 06:25:09.400 align:start position:0%
boss who is the primary sponsor of the
 
06:25:12.628 --> 06:25:12.638 align:start position:0%
bill which I wrote I am curious how you
 
06:25:14.468 --> 06:25:14.478 align:start position:0%
plan to sell around the inherent
 
06:25:17.030 --> 06:25:17.040 align:start position:0%
problems with the state selling cannabis
 
06:25:18.670 --> 06:25:18.680 align:start position:0%
which I have seen legal discussions
 
06:25:21.230 --> 06:25:21.240 align:start position:0%
about many times the consensus legal
 
06:25:23.990 --> 06:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
opinion is that it is a nonstarter
 
06:25:26.110 --> 06:25:26.120 align:start position:0%
because a state employee can't be
 
06:25:28.708 --> 06:25:28.718 align:start position:0%
subjected to Breaking federal law think
 
06:25:31.350 --> 06:25:31.360 align:start position:0%
about it the next president we elect may
 
06:25:33.948 --> 06:25:33.958 align:start position:0%
choose to actually follow cannabis laws
 
06:25:36.628 --> 06:25:36.638 align:start position:0%
and have the FDA and Federal Marshals
 
06:25:38.628 --> 06:25:38.638 align:start position:0%
make an example out of all 10 of the New
 
06:25:40.350 --> 06:25:40.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State adult used Cannabis
 
06:25:43.070 --> 06:25:43.080 align:start position:0%
stores who who own the only cannabis
 
06:25:45.310 --> 06:25:45.320 align:start position:0%
business in the US who won't be paying
 
06:25:47.590 --> 06:25:47.600 align:start position:0%
any business profit taxes to the federal
 
06:25:50.830 --> 06:25:50.840 align:start position:0%
government under 280e my partner Ryan
 
06:25:53.990 --> 06:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
will talk about that in a in a couple of
 
06:25:56.788 --> 06:25:56.798 align:start position:0%
minutes what an absolute disaster that
 
06:25:58.948 --> 06:25:58.958 align:start position:0%
will be if all 10 State Stores get
 
06:26:00.910 --> 06:26:00.920 align:start position:0%
raided At Once by Federal Marshals and
 
06:26:03.310 --> 06:26:03.320 align:start position:0%
the da who are cuffing and arresting
 
06:26:05.190 --> 06:26:05.200 align:start position:0%
state employees for breaking federal
 
06:26:07.948 --> 06:26:07.958 align:start position:0%
laws state cultivators and manufacturers
 
06:26:09.868 --> 06:26:09.878 align:start position:0%
could be R also be wrapped into this
 
06:26:12.270 --> 06:26:12.280 align:start position:0%
action also there is also problems with
 
06:26:15.110 --> 06:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
wrongful termination Let Me Explain If
 
06:26:17.310 --> 06:26:17.320 align:start position:0%
you hire somebody to be what we call a
 
06:26:20.150 --> 06:26:20.160 align:start position:0%
bun tender a cashier to sell cannabis at
 
06:26:22.390 --> 06:26:22.400 align:start position:0%
the counter and they think about it and
 
06:26:24.430 --> 06:26:24.440 align:start position:0%
they walk in and then when they get a
 
06:26:26.230 --> 06:26:26.240 align:start position:0%
chance to sell it they say to the boss
 
06:26:28.270 --> 06:26:28.280 align:start position:0%
of the store I'm not going to sell this
 
06:26:29.990 --> 06:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
I'm not selling something that's federal
 
06:26:32.430 --> 06:26:32.440 align:start position:0%
legal I could get in trouble if we fire
 
06:26:34.190 --> 06:26:34.200 align:start position:0%
that employee that's wrongful
 
06:26:36.430 --> 06:26:36.440 align:start position:0%
termination because we can't force them
 
06:26:40.830 --> 06:26:40.840 align:start position:0%
to violate a federal law uh you might
 
06:26:42.430 --> 06:26:42.440 align:start position:0%
not want to be the governor who signed
 
06:26:45.868 --> 06:26:45.878 align:start position:0%
that bill uh repa boss the author of the
 
06:26:47.350 --> 06:26:47.360 align:start position:0%
bill responded to
 
06:26:50.830 --> 06:26:50.840 align:start position:0%
me I quote I would be surprised if the
 
06:26:53.510 --> 06:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
federal government took any action to
 
06:26:55.948 --> 06:26:55.958 align:start position:0%
enforce federal laws on can and single
 
06:26:58.310 --> 06:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
out just New Hampshire I was very
 
06:26:59.948 --> 06:26:59.958 align:start position:0%
surprised at his answerer and I
 
06:27:02.230 --> 06:27:02.240 align:start position:0%
submitted to you a handout and if you
 
06:27:04.788 --> 06:27:04.798 align:start position:0%
look at the handout okay let me explain
 
06:27:06.708 --> 06:27:06.718 align:start position:0%
this to you so in case you wonder if the
 
06:27:09.628 --> 06:27:09.638 align:start position:0%
feds are going to come to come for us in
 
06:27:12.510 --> 06:27:12.520 align:start position:0%
Florida Federal Marshall sees more than
 
06:27:16.948 --> 06:27:16.958 align:start position:0%
7 207,000 used unrated dietary
 
06:27:19.190 --> 06:27:19.200 align:start position:0%
supplements containing katum for those
 
06:27:21.230 --> 06:27:21.240 align:start position:0%
of you who aren't who don't understand
 
06:27:23.910 --> 06:27:23.920 align:start position:0%
what katum is they sell it in stores in
 
06:27:26.230 --> 06:27:26.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire it's a supplementary diet
 
06:27:28.868 --> 06:27:28.878 align:start position:0%
diet product and it comes from a tree
 
06:27:30.990 --> 06:27:31.000 align:start position:0%
it's an evergreen tree grown in like
 
06:27:32.948 --> 06:27:32.958 align:start position:0%
Indonesia and it's basically a
 
06:27:35.830 --> 06:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
replacement for painkillers and it's
 
06:27:38.948 --> 06:27:38.958 align:start position:0%
very very addictive so what happened was
 
06:27:40.830 --> 06:27:40.840 align:start position:0%
one of the go federal government doesn't
 
06:27:42.910 --> 06:27:42.920 align:start position:0%
like it even though it's totally legal
 
06:27:45.548 --> 06:27:45.558 align:start position:0%
and it's been made legal for topical use
 
06:27:47.708 --> 06:27:47.718 align:start position:0%
and now it's being consumed all over the
 
06:27:50.910 --> 06:27:50.920 align:start position:0%
United States in giant quantities and in
 
06:27:53.590 --> 06:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
Alabama there was one guy that owned all
 
06:27:55.990 --> 06:27:56.000 align:start position:0%
the stores just about and they decided
 
06:27:57.590 --> 06:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
they were going to make an example out
 
06:28:00.270 --> 06:28:00.280 align:start position:0%
of him so they went into his stores the
 
06:28:02.510 --> 06:28:02.520 align:start position:0%
FDA and the Federal Marshals and they
 
06:28:04.150 --> 06:28:04.160 align:start position:0%
arrested him and they took all his
 
06:28:06.350 --> 06:28:06.360 align:start position:0%
product and they noticed who was
 
06:28:08.788 --> 06:28:08.798 align:start position:0%
supplying it it was bug big supplier in
 
06:28:11.468 --> 06:28:11.478 align:start position:0%
federal Florida then they went up there
 
06:28:15.150 --> 06:28:15.160 align:start position:0%
with about 20 Federal Marshals and FDA
 
06:28:18.150 --> 06:28:18.160 align:start position:0%
and walked in the front door pulled the
 
06:28:20.590 --> 06:28:20.600 align:start position:0%
owner of the company out and made him
 
06:28:23.310 --> 06:28:23.320 align:start position:0%
fire all the 50 of his employees They
 
06:28:25.270 --> 06:28:25.280 align:start position:0%
seized all his goods and they they put
 
06:28:27.230 --> 06:28:27.240 align:start position:0%
yellow tape around it and they told the
 
06:28:29.150 --> 06:28:29.160 align:start position:0%
owner that if he even touched it or
 
06:28:31.150 --> 06:28:31.160 align:start position:0%
anybody was allowed in the building that
 
06:28:33.030 --> 06:28:33.040 align:start position:0%
they'd put him in federal prison and
 
06:28:35.350 --> 06:28:35.360 align:start position:0%
that he was going to have to pay
 
06:28:38.510 --> 06:28:38.520 align:start position:0%
$250,000 to throw it out now if you're
 
06:28:40.548 --> 06:28:40.558 align:start position:0%
wondering why I have all the details of
 
06:28:42.590 --> 06:28:42.600 align:start position:0%
this to tell you it was my brother it
 
06:28:45.628 --> 06:28:45.638 align:start position:0%
was his business so when a when a
 
06:28:47.310 --> 06:28:47.320 align:start position:0%
representative abas said he'd be
 
06:28:49.628 --> 06:28:49.638 align:start position:0%
surprised I can tell you something my
 
06:28:51.670 --> 06:28:51.680 align:start position:0%
brother was surprised if I go see him
 
06:28:53.430 --> 06:28:53.440 align:start position:0%
right now almost a year later that look
 
06:28:56.868 --> 06:28:56.878 align:start position:0%
still on his face and so so anyhow I
 
06:28:59.070 --> 06:28:59.080 align:start position:0%
wanted to cover those issues we'd be
 
06:29:00.788 --> 06:29:00.798 align:start position:0%
happy to answer questions at the end but
 
06:29:03.070 --> 06:29:03.080 align:start position:0%
I'm going to let the last part of it my
 
06:29:05.868 --> 06:29:05.878 align:start position:0%
my partner Ryan uh take care of take us
 
06:29:08.270 --> 06:29:08.280 align:start position:0%
out do you have a copy of your testimony
 
06:29:11.030 --> 06:29:11.040 align:start position:0%
you could I I I do and I'm going to send
 
06:29:13.190 --> 06:29:13.200 align:start position:0%
it to all you I've been sending a lot of
 
06:29:15.430 --> 06:29:15.440 align:start position:0%
what you guys are talking about to uh
 
06:29:17.430 --> 06:29:17.440 align:start position:0%
representative abrami you know that's
 
06:29:19.390 --> 06:29:19.400 align:start position:0%
one of I was so familiar with a lot of
 
06:29:22.350 --> 06:29:22.360 align:start position:0%
it so thank you so just narrowing down
 
06:29:24.270 --> 06:29:24.280 align:start position:0%
and focusing on really what I saw
 
06:29:25.788 --> 06:29:25.798 align:start position:0%
throughout the budget so as an operator
 
06:29:27.590 --> 06:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
of a vertically integrated adult used
 
06:29:30.430 --> 06:29:30.440 align:start position:0%
company uh I think your budget is the
 
06:29:32.310 --> 06:29:32.320 align:start position:0%
budget in this bill specifically is
 
06:29:35.110 --> 06:29:35.120 align:start position:0%
fairly unrealistic as far the as far as
 
06:29:36.948 --> 06:29:36.958 align:start position:0%
the assumptions that are being made uh
 
06:29:38.510 --> 06:29:38.520 align:start position:0%
you know from inventory only being at
 
06:29:41.110 --> 06:29:41.120 align:start position:0%
70,000 can you move the mic closer is
 
06:29:43.830 --> 06:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
that can is that good there we go I
 
06:29:45.390 --> 06:29:45.400 align:start position:0%
think that some of the initial concerns
 
06:29:47.430 --> 06:29:47.440 align:start position:0%
with your budget is for instance is the
 
06:29:49.230 --> 06:29:49.240 align:start position:0%
initial inventory so for instance you
 
06:29:51.910 --> 06:29:51.920 align:start position:0%
allocate $70,000 per store we're opening
 
06:29:53.868 --> 06:29:53.878 align:start position:0%
a store another store in two weeks and
 
06:29:55.830 --> 06:29:55.840 align:start position:0%
we'll have roughly 200 50 to
 
06:29:59.510 --> 06:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
$300,000 on hand as we open wholesale
 
06:30:01.830 --> 06:30:01.840 align:start position:0%
correct uh on the wholesale front
 
06:30:03.310 --> 06:30:03.320 align:start position:0%
additionally some of your additional
 
06:30:05.030 --> 06:30:05.040 align:start position:0%
costs that you lay that are laid out in
 
06:30:07.230 --> 06:30:07.240 align:start position:0%
this budget from Furnishings point of
 
06:30:09.708 --> 06:30:09.718 align:start position:0%
sale to training are all significantly
 
06:30:11.910 --> 06:30:11.920 align:start position:0%
I'd say under budget probably by about
 
06:30:14.150 --> 06:30:14.160 align:start position:0%
two to three times what it would really
 
06:30:16.548 --> 06:30:16.558 align:start position:0%
take um some of the other broader
 
06:30:17.990 --> 06:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
concerns of what I saw throughout the
 
06:30:19.548 --> 06:30:19.558 align:start position:0%
budget is it really comes down to the
 
06:30:22.230 --> 06:30:22.240 align:start position:0%
buying process of how it would work so
 
06:30:24.190 --> 06:30:24.200 align:start position:0%
as the as representative boss said that
 
06:30:26.190 --> 06:30:26.200 align:start position:0%
you know someone may investing 5 to 7
 
06:30:28.910 --> 06:30:28.920 align:start position:0%
million but in a market where it could
 
06:30:31.628 --> 06:30:31.638 align:start position:0%
cost anywhere from $500 to $1,200 a
 
06:30:34.230 --> 06:30:34.240 align:start position:0%
pound to produce if the state decides to
 
06:30:36.150 --> 06:30:36.160 align:start position:0%
say well we want to be competitive and
 
06:30:38.628 --> 06:30:38.638 align:start position:0%
we're only going to buy it at X dollars
 
06:30:40.310 --> 06:30:40.320 align:start position:0%
now you're putting the pressure on the
 
06:30:42.110 --> 06:30:42.120 align:start position:0%
cultivator that they must be able to
 
06:30:44.110 --> 06:30:44.120 align:start position:0%
produce at a price point that may not be
 
06:30:45.830 --> 06:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
either sustainable or profitable for
 
06:30:46.910 --> 06:30:46.920 align:start position:0%
them as an
 
06:30:49.830 --> 06:30:49.840 align:start position:0%
entity um so overall I think that the
 
06:30:51.750 --> 06:30:51.760 align:start position:0%
entire budget has substantial issues on
 
06:30:53.910 --> 06:30:53.920 align:start position:0%
its initial assumptions and just to harp
 
06:30:55.670 --> 06:30:55.680 align:start position:0%
on one other element which was I know we
 
06:30:57.670 --> 06:30:57.680 align:start position:0%
heard a lot on the banking front but in
 
06:31:00.230 --> 06:31:00.240 align:start position:0%
multiple St States banking Credit Unions
 
06:31:01.510 --> 06:31:01.520 align:start position:0%
all of those Services have been
 
06:31:03.750 --> 06:31:03.760 align:start position:0%
available to the Cannabis industry uh
 
06:31:06.150 --> 06:31:06.160 align:start position:0%
it's not easy uh to say the very least
 
06:31:08.270 --> 06:31:08.280 align:start position:0%
but those services do exist often times
 
06:31:10.468 --> 06:31:10.478 align:start position:0%
it's through a credit union uh the fees
 
06:31:13.830 --> 06:31:13.840 align:start position:0%
are expensive uh transporting is done
 
06:31:16.070 --> 06:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
often times by you know you as a company
 
06:31:17.548 --> 06:31:17.558 align:start position:0%
can do it or you hire third party
 
06:31:20.070 --> 06:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
resources to handle that um but that's
 
06:31:22.190 --> 06:31:22.200 align:start position:0%
just kind of an initial Glimpse at at
 
06:31:23.990 --> 06:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
that aspect one other element to touch
 
06:31:25.270 --> 06:31:25.280 align:start position:0%
on was
 
06:31:28.590 --> 06:31:28.600 align:start position:0%
uh what the um police chief mentioned
 
06:31:31.110 --> 06:31:31.120 align:start position:0%
and according to the uh this was a study
 
06:31:33.990 --> 06:31:34.000 align:start position:0%
done by the Department of Justice um
 
06:31:37.350 --> 06:31:37.360 align:start position:0%
back in 2019 the purpose of the study
 
06:31:39.628 --> 06:31:39.638 align:start position:0%
was to evaluate what does marijuana
 
06:31:42.270 --> 06:31:42.280 align:start position:0%
legalization and decriminalization how
 
06:31:44.750 --> 06:31:44.760 align:start position:0%
it impacts the states their overall
 
06:31:47.190 --> 06:31:47.200 align:start position:0%
analysis concluded a few points one was
 
06:31:49.350 --> 06:31:49.360 align:start position:0%
that legalizing the recreational use of
 
06:31:51.830 --> 06:31:51.840 align:start position:0%
marijuana resulted in fewer marijuana
 
06:31:54.788 --> 06:31:54.798 align:start position:0%
related arrests and court cases two
 
06:31:56.548 --> 06:31:56.558 align:start position:0%
legalizing marijuana did not have
 
06:31:58.430 --> 06:31:58.440 align:start position:0%
noticeable impact on indicators in
 
06:32:00.030 --> 06:32:00.040 align:start position:0%
states that bordered those legalized
 
06:32:02.388 --> 06:32:02.398 align:start position:0%
States and three there are no noticeable
 
06:32:04.628 --> 06:32:04.638 align:start position:0%
indications of an increase in arrests
 
06:32:06.468 --> 06:32:06.478 align:start position:0%
related to the transportation
 
06:32:08.788 --> 06:32:08.798 align:start position:0%
trafficking offenses in those States as
 
06:32:10.750 --> 06:32:10.760 align:start position:0%
well so all of this information we will
 
06:32:12.670 --> 06:32:12.680 align:start position:0%
be able to provide which directly
 
06:32:12.680 --> 06:32:14.270 align:start position:0%
be able to provide which directly
contradicts

06:32:14.270 --> 06:32:14.280 align:start position:0%
contradicts
 
06:32:17.110 --> 06:32:17.120 align:start position:0%
our respectfully the Bedford police
 
06:32:20.350 --> 06:32:20.360 align:start position:0%
chief uh on literally every issues and
 
06:32:21.990 --> 06:32:22.000 align:start position:0%
their and their reach out of the hand
 
06:32:24.590 --> 06:32:24.600 align:start position:0%
into into the budget it it's cont
 
06:32:26.948 --> 06:32:26.958 align:start position:0%
contradicted by the federal government
 
06:32:29.430 --> 06:32:29.440 align:start position:0%
who isn't a fan of cannabis to start
 
06:32:29.440 --> 06:32:31.270 align:start position:0%
who isn't a fan of cannabis to start
with

06:32:31.270 --> 06:32:31.280 align:start position:0%
with
 
06:32:34.868 --> 06:32:34.878 align:start position:0%
so any anyway any questions any
 
06:32:38.270 --> 06:32:38.280 align:start position:0%
questions questions representative BR
 
06:32:39.430 --> 06:32:39.440 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
06:32:42.590 --> 06:32:42.600 align:start position:0%
your testimony um you mentioned a few
 
06:32:45.070 --> 06:32:45.080 align:start position:0%
things uh shelf
 
06:32:48.388 --> 06:32:48.398 align:start position:0%
life what is a shelf life shelf life
 
06:32:50.548 --> 06:32:50.558 align:start position:0%
first of all it's cured let me let me
 
06:32:53.150 --> 06:32:53.160 align:start position:0%
clear something else up
 
06:32:55.430 --> 06:32:55.440 align:start position:0%
representative uh I'm
 
06:32:59.070 --> 06:32:59.080 align:start position:0%
sorry rep representative of brami's uh
 
06:33:01.230 --> 06:33:01.240 align:start position:0%
um explanation which he gave me also
 
06:33:03.310 --> 06:33:03.320 align:start position:0%
that basically what was going to happen
 
06:33:05.788 --> 06:33:05.798 align:start position:0%
just like it happens in liquor stores is
 
06:33:07.868 --> 06:33:07.878 align:start position:0%
let's say we decide we need a particular
 
06:33:09.708 --> 06:33:09.718 align:start position:0%
strain of cannabis that was selling good
 
06:33:11.990 --> 06:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
in our shelves and now I want to go back
 
06:33:14.628 --> 06:33:14.638 align:start position:0%
to the cultivator and I want to say hey
 
06:33:17.670 --> 06:33:17.680 align:start position:0%
I want to order 500 lb well we're not
 
06:33:19.230 --> 06:33:19.240 align:start position:0%
producing widgets and gigs were're
 
06:33:21.750 --> 06:33:21.760 align:start position:0%
growing in specific rooms of specific
 
06:33:23.990 --> 06:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
sizes and let me tell you how it goes so
 
06:33:25.310 --> 06:33:25.320 align:start position:0%
they'd come in and they'd order the
 
06:33:27.708 --> 06:33:27.718 align:start position:0%
Cannabis well first of all we don't have
 
06:33:30.270 --> 06:33:30.280 align:start position:0%
empty rooms waiting we have millions
 
06:33:32.030 --> 06:33:32.040 align:start position:0%
invested in these Ventures so we have
 
06:33:33.948 --> 06:33:33.958 align:start position:0%
cannabis growing if we didn't have the
 
06:33:36.150 --> 06:33:36.160 align:start position:0%
right strain we'd have to and strains
 
06:33:38.350 --> 06:33:38.360 align:start position:0%
are proprietary to each supplier
 
06:33:39.468 --> 06:33:39.478 align:start position:0%
generally speaking there's some
 
06:33:40.750 --> 06:33:40.760 align:start position:0%
commercial Plains but they're
 
06:33:43.350 --> 06:33:43.360 align:start position:0%
proprietary so what we' do is we take
 
06:33:44.788 --> 06:33:44.798 align:start position:0%
the order we'd wait till the room is
 
06:33:46.910 --> 06:33:46.920 align:start position:0%
empty then we'd cut clones off from
 
06:33:48.548 --> 06:33:48.558 align:start position:0%
other plants we'd put clones in the
 
06:33:50.150 --> 06:33:50.160 align:start position:0%
ground it would take a couple of two or
 
06:33:52.750 --> 06:33:52.760 align:start position:0%
three weeks to grow the Clones we'd move
 
06:33:55.388 --> 06:33:55.398 align:start position:0%
them into What's called the veg St stage
 
06:33:57.830 --> 06:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
okay and the veg stage takes a few weeks
 
06:34:00.468 --> 06:34:00.478 align:start position:0%
to a month they grow the plants bigger
 
06:34:02.310 --> 06:34:02.320 align:start position:0%
the veg stage happens when we put the
 
06:34:05.310 --> 06:34:05.320 align:start position:0%
lights on 18 hours a day what the plant
 
06:34:08.030 --> 06:34:08.040 align:start position:0%
perceives is summertime to grow then
 
06:34:09.910 --> 06:34:09.920 align:start position:0%
what happens is when the plants get big
 
06:34:12.070 --> 06:34:12.080 align:start position:0%
enough after a few weeks we put them in
 
06:34:14.788 --> 06:34:14.798 align:start position:0%
budding stage which the only difference
 
06:34:17.468 --> 06:34:17.478 align:start position:0%
is we turn the lights on for 12 hours
 
06:34:20.030 --> 06:34:20.040 align:start position:0%
instead of 18 hours okay cuz they think
 
06:34:22.070 --> 06:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
it's the fall and it's time to Bud and
 
06:34:24.230 --> 06:34:24.240 align:start position:0%
put their seeds out for the fall and
 
06:34:24.240 --> 06:34:25.150 align:start position:0%
put their seeds out for the fall and
then

06:34:25.150 --> 06:34:25.160 align:start position:0%
then
 
06:34:27.350 --> 06:34:27.360 align:start position:0%
after that couple months there we cut
 
06:34:29.830 --> 06:34:29.840 align:start position:0%
the plants and then we have to cure the
 
06:34:33.110 --> 06:34:33.120 align:start position:0%
plants which can take 45 to 60 days then
 
06:34:34.990 --> 06:34:35.000 align:start position:0%
we trim the plants then we got to
 
06:34:36.788 --> 06:34:36.798 align:start position:0%
package the plants and by the time we
 
06:34:39.230 --> 06:34:39.240 align:start position:0%
Supply his order it's going to be 6
 
06:34:41.230 --> 06:34:41.240 align:start position:0%
months later and the shelf's going to
 
06:34:43.388 --> 06:34:43.398 align:start position:0%
have something else on it and maybe he
 
06:34:45.430 --> 06:34:45.440 align:start position:0%
don't want it and I just spent 10 $2
 
06:34:48.830 --> 06:34:48.840 align:start position:0%
million growing it cuz a new strains uh
 
06:34:51.990 --> 06:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
come out um and but directly to your
 
06:34:53.910 --> 06:34:53.920 align:start position:0%
question of shelf life which was really
 
06:34:55.830 --> 06:34:55.840 align:start position:0%
generally that you're looking at once it
 
06:34:57.910 --> 06:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
gets into a store there are some broad
 
06:34:59.750 --> 06:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
ranges but I would say four to 6 months
 
06:35:03.030 --> 06:35:03.040 align:start position:0%
is what we personally stand by because
 
06:35:05.190 --> 06:35:05.200 align:start position:0%
you can have degradation of product you
 
06:35:06.750 --> 06:35:06.760 align:start position:0%
can have those imp you misorder then
 
06:35:08.830 --> 06:35:08.840 align:start position:0%
you're you're out or the store is out
 
06:35:10.788 --> 06:35:10.798 align:start position:0%
because it goes spoils it's like milkco
 
06:35:13.670 --> 06:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
spoil well correct I mean the idea of
 
06:35:15.830 --> 06:35:15.840 align:start position:0%
yeah exactly right I mean you you but
 
06:35:17.788 --> 06:35:17.798 align:start position:0%
the idea here too of by not allowing
 
06:35:20.030 --> 06:35:20.040 align:start position:0%
infused products you also cut off the
 
06:35:22.990 --> 06:35:23.000 align:start position:0%
ability to use call it some
 
06:35:24.990 --> 06:35:25.000 align:start position:0%
unsatisfactory product that the consumer
 
06:35:26.788 --> 06:35:26.798 align:start position:0%
now want visually to put into those
 
06:35:28.948 --> 06:35:28.958 align:start position:0%
other products yeah go ahead what he
 
06:35:30.670 --> 06:35:30.680 align:start position:0%
means is before before the product
 
06:35:33.590 --> 06:35:33.600 align:start position:0%
spoils we could do what we call oil it
 
06:35:36.350 --> 06:35:36.360 align:start position:0%
we we basically yeah we basically
 
06:35:38.030 --> 06:35:38.040 align:start position:0%
extract the oil out of the plant before
 
06:35:39.590 --> 06:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
it spoils it and then we use it for
 
06:35:41.590 --> 06:35:41.600 align:start position:0%
cannabis and for fuse products which
 
06:35:43.150 --> 06:35:43.160 align:start position:0%
aren't legal so we'd have to throw it
 
06:35:45.070 --> 06:35:45.080 align:start position:0%
away we just throw the whole thing away
 
06:35:46.830 --> 06:35:46.840 align:start position:0%
this model that we're talking about here
 
06:35:49.990 --> 06:35:50.000 align:start position:0%
it you know basically folks the truth is
 
06:35:51.510 --> 06:35:51.520 align:start position:0%
everybody that we've showed this to in
 
06:35:53.310 --> 06:35:53.320 align:start position:0%
the industry almost had a laughing
 
06:35:56.310 --> 06:35:56.320 align:start position:0%
session it's like impossible to make the
 
06:35:58.310 --> 06:35:58.320 align:start position:0%
you can't move this you you can't
 
06:36:02.030 --> 06:36:02.040 align:start position:0%
reinvent the wheel you know we are pan
 
06:36:03.948 --> 06:36:03.958 align:start position:0%
proponents we'd like nothing better
 
06:36:05.510 --> 06:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
we're from New Hampshire than to see
 
06:36:09.230 --> 06:36:09.240 align:start position:0%
this state to have us and Matt Simon
 
06:36:11.150 --> 06:36:11.160 align:start position:0%
come in here to testify against a
 
06:36:13.670 --> 06:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
legalization bill it's like we can't
 
06:36:15.270 --> 06:36:15.280 align:start position:0%
even believe we're on the side of the
 
06:36:17.270 --> 06:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
prohibition that's coming in here but
 
06:36:19.670 --> 06:36:19.680 align:start position:0%
you guys don't get it if you put this
 
06:36:21.590 --> 06:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
bill through I'm telling you we think
 
06:36:23.110 --> 06:36:23.120 align:start position:0%
it's going to collapse we think the
 
06:36:24.948 --> 06:36:24.958 align:start position:0%
whole thing's going to collapse and we
 
06:36:27.388 --> 06:36:27.398 align:start position:0%
as a group and our investors don't have
 
06:36:29.468 --> 06:36:29.478 align:start position:0%
any interest being a supplier under this
 
06:36:31.948 --> 06:36:31.958 align:start position:0%
circumstances for this bill and that's
 
06:36:34.270 --> 06:36:34.280 align:start position:0%
and that's basically our opinion but the
 
06:36:36.070 --> 06:36:36.080 align:start position:0%
takeaway number one from your
 
06:36:37.670 --> 06:36:37.680 align:start position:0%
perspective is that we're going to have
 
06:36:40.590 --> 06:36:40.600 align:start position:0%
trouble attracting B uh Growers here
 
06:36:42.910 --> 06:36:42.920 align:start position:0%
you're under the current situation I
 
06:36:44.868 --> 06:36:44.878 align:start position:0%
talked to six of probably the top 10
 
06:36:47.070 --> 06:36:47.080 align:start position:0%
growers in Massachusetts I'm talking
 
06:36:50.190 --> 06:36:50.200 align:start position:0%
about companies that grow metric tons we
 
06:36:52.868 --> 06:36:52.878 align:start position:0%
have 60,000 square fet that translates
 
06:36:56.070 --> 06:36:56.080 align:start position:0%
into about $60 million of of cannabis
 
06:36:58.270 --> 06:36:58.280 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah I think the part of where it's
 
06:37:00.150 --> 06:37:00.160 align:start position:0%
unattractive is understanding what is
 
06:37:02.230 --> 06:37:02.240 align:start position:0%
the buying process what's our risk in
 
06:37:04.070 --> 06:37:04.080 align:start position:0%
this if I'm going to put up five six
 
06:37:06.270 --> 06:37:06.280 align:start position:0%
seven million dollars right I need to
 
06:37:08.468 --> 06:37:08.478 align:start position:0%
have some kind of safety in there to
 
06:37:09.948 --> 06:37:09.958 align:start position:0%
safeguard that level of an investment
 
06:37:11.628 --> 06:37:11.638 align:start position:0%
for something that is going into a
 
06:37:13.110 --> 06:37:13.120 align:start position:0%
controlled Market rather than a free
 
06:37:14.510 --> 06:37:14.520 align:start position:0%
market and letting the consumer decide
 
06:37:16.310 --> 06:37:16.320 align:start position:0%
okay I know we're running late so one
 
06:37:18.910 --> 06:37:18.920 align:start position:0%
one more that that what is the typical
 
06:37:21.548 --> 06:37:21.558 align:start position:0%
age again for people who buy Edibles is
 
06:37:23.670 --> 06:37:23.680 align:start position:0%
it the the older crowd the younger crowd
 
06:37:25.670 --> 06:37:25.680 align:start position:0%
is who who buys the Edibles so so we
 
06:37:27.830 --> 06:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
have found in specifically in our stores
 
06:37:30.190 --> 06:37:30.200 align:start position:0%
that it generally errors on the side of
 
06:37:32.910 --> 06:37:32.920 align:start position:0%
older say again older so probably I'd
 
06:37:36.230 --> 06:37:36.240 align:start position:0%
say 45 plus uh but the the size of the
 
06:37:37.190 --> 06:37:37.200 align:start position:0%
market when you're looking at the
 
06:37:39.150 --> 06:37:39.160 align:start position:0%
infused I mean you could easily have 25
 
06:37:41.110 --> 06:37:41.120 align:start position:0%
to 30% of the market that would want
 
06:37:45.030 --> 06:37:45.040 align:start position:0%
Edibles and one other key element of the
 
06:37:46.430 --> 06:37:46.440 align:start position:0%
concept or the idea that medical
 
06:37:48.830 --> 06:37:48.840 align:start position:0%
patients may not you know want to have
 
06:37:50.548 --> 06:37:50.558 align:start position:0%
their medical card is we deal with a lot
 
06:37:52.830 --> 06:37:52.840 align:start position:0%
of veterans specifically and a lot of
 
06:37:54.270 --> 06:37:54.280 align:start position:0%
veterans don't aren't interested in
 
06:37:55.510 --> 06:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
necessarily having their information in
 
06:37:57.948 --> 06:37:57.958 align:start position:0%
a system one more can I ask one more
 
06:37:59.990 --> 06:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
question this because it has to do has
 
06:38:01.270 --> 06:38:01.280 align:start position:0%
to do with the
 
06:38:04.150 --> 06:38:04.160 align:start position:0%
atcs I'm assuming that Maine has you're
 
06:38:06.070 --> 06:38:06.080 align:start position:0%
working in M you do your shops in Maine
 
06:38:09.708 --> 06:38:09.718 align:start position:0%
correct you have atcs in Maine as well H
 
06:38:11.510 --> 06:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
how how do they work together are the
 
06:38:15.070 --> 06:38:15.080 align:start position:0%
atcs allowed to uh broaden out and also
 
06:38:17.548 --> 06:38:17.558 align:start position:0%
have recreational no so how how is that
 
06:38:19.948 --> 06:38:19.958 align:start position:0%
working out how what's happened to the
 
06:38:21.468 --> 06:38:21.478 align:start position:0%
atcs in that store has there been any
 
06:38:23.628 --> 06:38:23.638 align:start position:0%
harm done to them so yes so that there
 
06:38:25.548 --> 06:38:25.558 align:start position:0%
is so so if they were medical they still
 
06:38:27.150 --> 06:38:27.160 align:start position:0%
needed to in essence have separate
 
06:38:28.830 --> 06:38:28.840 align:start position:0%
licensing so if they wanted to have
 
06:38:30.270 --> 06:38:30.280 align:start position:0%
adult use they'd have to go down that
 
06:38:32.270 --> 06:38:32.280 align:start position:0%
specific path and Most states that have
 
06:38:34.190 --> 06:38:34.200 align:start position:0%
both had a medical industry and then
 
06:38:36.990 --> 06:38:37.000 align:start position:0%
they had the adult industry later on
 
06:38:38.388 --> 06:38:38.398 align:start position:0%
generally the medical industry starts to
 
06:38:39.910 --> 06:38:39.920 align:start position:0%
decrease because you know there's just
 
06:38:41.830 --> 06:38:41.840 align:start position:0%
the in essence just call it you know you
 
06:38:43.230 --> 06:38:43.240 align:start position:0%
have to go get a card you have to go
 
06:38:44.990 --> 06:38:45.000 align:start position:0%
through these extra steps rather than
 
06:38:46.750 --> 06:38:46.760 align:start position:0%
just being able to go in with your ID
 
06:38:49.030 --> 06:38:49.040 align:start position:0%
and buy whatever product you would seek
 
06:38:50.388 --> 06:38:50.398 align:start position:0%
any further
 
06:38:52.910 --> 06:38:52.920 align:start position:0%
questions and another thing to clarify
 
06:38:54.868 --> 06:38:54.878 align:start position:0%
the Reps because nobody's clar ify to
 
06:38:58.468 --> 06:38:58.478 align:start position:0%
you they're mixing up can yes can
 
06:39:01.430 --> 06:39:01.440 align:start position:0%
medical patients go into a store and buy
 
06:39:03.628 --> 06:39:03.638 align:start position:0%
infused products or flour or anything
 
06:39:06.030 --> 06:39:06.040 align:start position:0%
else yeah they can but there's a big
 
06:39:07.510 --> 06:39:07.520 align:start position:0%
difference between medical and
 
06:39:09.750 --> 06:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
recreational and here's what it is the
 
06:39:11.708 --> 06:39:11.718 align:start position:0%
gummies that you got that I gave you
 
06:39:13.468 --> 06:39:13.478 align:start position:0%
right there right if we had loaded them
 
06:39:15.868 --> 06:39:15.878 align:start position:0%
with THC we would have put 10 milligrams
 
06:39:18.750 --> 06:39:18.760 align:start position:0%
of THC in it okay but that's not a lot
 
06:39:22.548 --> 06:39:22.558 align:start position:0%
of THC not enough for a can a cancer
 
06:39:25.628 --> 06:39:25.638 align:start position:0%
patient and so in the medical industry
 
06:39:28.750 --> 06:39:28.760 align:start position:0%
we're not limited we we 10 milligrams is
 
06:39:31.750 --> 06:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
what's in would be in those jars in in
 
06:39:33.788 --> 06:39:33.798 align:start position:0%
medical store you can have 50 milligrams
 
06:39:36.110 --> 06:39:36.120 align:start position:0%
in a gummy you could have a 100 there's
 
06:39:37.708 --> 06:39:37.718 align:start position:0%
there's basically no limits you're
 
06:39:39.468 --> 06:39:39.478 align:start position:0%
treating a patient based on their
 
06:39:40.910 --> 06:39:40.920 align:start position:0%
condition and you may need an excessive
 
06:39:43.150 --> 06:39:43.160 align:start position:0%
money so to say they're going to even to
 
06:39:44.150 --> 06:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
think that they're going to go in the
 
06:39:46.230 --> 06:39:46.240 align:start position:0%
stores and to buy things it's it's just
 
06:39:47.910 --> 06:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
a totally different thing and to give
 
06:39:49.990 --> 06:39:50.000 align:start position:0%
you some idea how big the medical is in
 
06:39:52.868 --> 06:39:52.878 align:start position:0%
Maine there's 3,300 compassionate
 
06:39:54.468 --> 06:39:54.478 align:start position:0%
caregivers and every one of them can
 
06:39:57.590 --> 06:39:57.600 align:start position:0%
grow cannabis you know and and plus
 
06:39:59.830 --> 06:39:59.840 align:start position:0%
there a lot that have stores and if you
 
06:40:01.510 --> 06:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
wonder where your black Market's coming
 
06:40:03.990 --> 06:40:04.000 align:start position:0%
from I can tell you for sure you know
 
06:40:05.548 --> 06:40:05.558 align:start position:0%
that's and you know that's what's going
 
06:40:06.868 --> 06:40:06.878 align:start position:0%
on it's a different model in main than
 
06:40:08.590 --> 06:40:08.600 align:start position:0%
we it's a different model tot thank you
 
06:40:12.430 --> 06:40:12.440 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm okay thank you thank you
 
06:40:12.440 --> 06:40:13.628 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm okay thank you thank you
thank

06:40:13.628 --> 06:40:13.638 align:start position:0%
thank
 
06:40:16.628 --> 06:40:16.638 align:start position:0%
you important feature of
 
06:40:19.948 --> 06:40:19.958 align:start position:0%
this is the Liquor
 
06:40:21.670 --> 06:40:21.680 align:start position:0%
Commission they're going to be
 
06:40:24.788 --> 06:40:24.798 align:start position:0%
responsible for stores and operating the
 
06:40:26.990 --> 06:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
stores so we have somebody from the
 
06:40:29.788 --> 06:40:29.798 align:start position:0%
liquor commissioner here commission here
 
06:40:32.070 --> 06:40:32.080 align:start position:0%
and aan Moore is
 
06:40:37.110 --> 06:40:37.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:39.868 --> 06:40:39.878 align:start position:0%
much and and you'll fill out a pink card
 
06:40:42.230 --> 06:40:42.240 align:start position:0%
before I have it filled up now sir ready
 
06:40:44.910 --> 06:40:44.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:48.030 --> 06:40:48.040 align:start position:0%
then uh thank you for the opportunity to
 
06:40:52.468 --> 06:40:52.478 align:start position:0%
be here sir um before I really take any
 
06:40:55.070 --> 06:40:55.080 align:start position:0%
questions I would just like to offer a
 
06:40:57.590 --> 06:40:57.600 align:start position:0%
few comments uh previous bills on
 
06:40:59.670 --> 06:40:59.680 align:start position:0%
legalization of cannabis have suggested
 
06:41:01.670 --> 06:41:01.680 align:start position:0%
creating a a separate commission to
 
06:41:03.910 --> 06:41:03.920 align:start position:0%
oversee the various responsibilities
 
06:41:05.910 --> 06:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
associated with legal
 
06:41:08.110 --> 06:41:08.120 align:start position:0%
legalization uh the commission takes no
 
06:41:10.708 --> 06:41:10.718 align:start position:0%
position on which organizational
 
06:41:12.388 --> 06:41:12.398 align:start position:0%
approach to the legalization would be
 
06:41:15.190 --> 06:41:15.200 align:start position:0%
most effective if a bill were to become
 
06:41:18.110 --> 06:41:18.120 align:start position:0%
law and the commission does not endorse
 
06:41:21.388 --> 06:41:21.398 align:start position:0%
this bill nor takes a position on the
 
06:41:23.190 --> 06:41:23.200 align:start position:0%
policy questions that are part of the
 
06:41:23.200 --> 06:41:24.468 align:start position:0%
policy questions that are part of the
bill

06:41:24.468 --> 06:41:24.478 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:41:26.990 --> 06:41:27.000 align:start position:0%
so with that being said Mr chairman I'd
 
06:41:29.628 --> 06:41:29.638 align:start position:0%
be happy to take any questions about our
 
06:41:32.310 --> 06:41:32.320 align:start position:0%
fiscal worksheet or any of the
 
06:41:34.750 --> 06:41:34.760 align:start position:0%
information how we came up with the
 
06:41:37.150 --> 06:41:37.160 align:start position:0%
model that we came up with uh I'll be
 
06:41:39.150 --> 06:41:39.160 align:start position:0%
happy to do that sir if you could go
 
06:41:42.830 --> 06:41:42.840 align:start position:0%
over your F uh the fiscal
 
06:41:46.150 --> 06:41:46.160 align:start position:0%
worksheet uh excuse me essentially we
 
06:41:49.708 --> 06:41:49.718 align:start position:0%
engaged in a uh once uh representative
 
06:41:54.150 --> 06:41:54.160 align:start position:0%
uh Abus uh U file this legislation uh we
 
06:41:57.230 --> 06:41:57.240 align:start position:0%
were approached uh obviously by the LBA
 
06:42:01.270 --> 06:42:01.280 align:start position:0%
to uh work up a worksheet on this um and
 
06:42:03.948 --> 06:42:03.958 align:start position:0%
with this uh the the commission chairman
 
06:42:06.830 --> 06:42:06.840 align:start position:0%
convened a group of uh his managers and
 
06:42:09.948 --> 06:42:09.958 align:start position:0%
division heads and said if we were to
 
06:42:12.310 --> 06:42:12.320 align:start position:0%
have this responsibility how would we
 
06:42:14.030 --> 06:42:14.040 align:start position:0%
approach it what would it look like how
 
06:42:16.990 --> 06:42:17.000 align:start position:0%
would we do things uh there's a the
 
06:42:20.110 --> 06:42:20.120 align:start position:0%
first um consideration that the
 
06:42:23.070 --> 06:42:23.080 align:start position:0%
commission had was to make sure that
 
06:42:23.080 --> 06:42:24.510 align:start position:0%
commission had was to make sure that
nothing

06:42:24.510 --> 06:42:24.520 align:start position:0%
nothing
 
06:42:27.510 --> 06:42:27.520 align:start position:0%
um associated with a bill would
 
06:42:30.430 --> 06:42:30.440 align:start position:0%
compromise the state's ability to keep
 
06:42:34.110 --> 06:42:34.120 align:start position:0%
its brand identity for its state liquor
 
06:42:36.990 --> 06:42:37.000 align:start position:0%
Outlets uh that's a very important uh
 
06:42:38.830 --> 06:42:38.840 align:start position:0%
part of the revenue to the state of New
 
06:42:42.190 --> 06:42:42.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and um the approach was there
 
06:42:46.190 --> 06:42:46.200 align:start position:0%
was no interest in putting for example a
 
06:42:49.628 --> 06:42:49.638 align:start position:0%
cannabis Outlet in a state liquor store
 
06:42:51.190 --> 06:42:51.200 align:start position:0%
the approach was to keep them completely
 
06:42:54.510 --> 06:42:54.520 align:start position:0%
separate distinct brand identity
 
06:42:57.190 --> 06:42:57.200 align:start position:0%
and so therefore the budgets that were
 
06:43:00.270 --> 06:43:00.280 align:start position:0%
built were built around that concept of
 
06:43:03.990 --> 06:43:04.000 align:start position:0%
having a separate yet distinct operation
 
06:43:05.910 --> 06:43:05.920 align:start position:0%
If This Were to become law and that's
 
06:43:09.270 --> 06:43:09.280 align:start position:0%
how we approached this um we used the
 
06:43:12.430 --> 06:43:12.440 align:start position:0%
figure of 10 stores simply to come up
 
06:43:14.708 --> 06:43:14.718 align:start position:0%
with a a number a rough number as a
 
06:43:17.548 --> 06:43:17.558 align:start position:0%
place to possibly start and and clearly
 
06:43:20.788 --> 06:43:20.798 align:start position:0%
that is part of a an exercise it it it
 
06:43:23.628 --> 06:43:23.638 align:start position:0%
uh it certainly influenced the propos
 
06:43:25.230 --> 06:43:25.240 align:start position:0%
proposed budgets that we would put
 
06:43:27.468 --> 06:43:27.478 align:start position:0%
forward and therefore the number of
 
06:43:29.990 --> 06:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
personnel for example that you would see
 
06:43:34.190 --> 06:43:34.200 align:start position:0%
uh I think our estimates for all
 
06:43:37.070 --> 06:43:37.080 align:start position:0%
um aspects of personnel needs whether
 
06:43:39.388 --> 06:43:39.398 align:start position:0%
it's from Administration to enforcement
 
06:43:42.150 --> 06:43:42.160 align:start position:0%
to store operations had roughly 70
 
06:43:45.070 --> 06:43:45.080 align:start position:0%
people in it now clearly if you have 10
 
06:43:47.468 --> 06:43:47.478 align:start position:0%
stores you'd probably need this a number
 
06:43:50.350 --> 06:43:50.360 align:start position:0%
of people to run it if if the policy
 
06:43:52.350 --> 06:43:52.360 align:start position:0%
questions came up and said well we we
 
06:43:56.990 --> 06:43:57.000 align:start position:0%
only want to appro create um 5 million
 
06:43:59.350 --> 06:43:59.360 align:start position:0%
10 million then obviously these things
 
06:44:01.310 --> 06:44:01.320 align:start position:0%
would be paired back and those numbers
 
06:44:03.788 --> 06:44:03.798 align:start position:0%
would change so the the fiscal
 
06:44:05.948 --> 06:44:05.958 align:start position:0%
worksheets we've provided to you sir are
 
06:44:08.788 --> 06:44:08.798 align:start position:0%
really based upon uh that model of 10
 
06:44:11.590 --> 06:44:11.600 align:start position:0%
stores with the Staffing and
 
06:44:13.430 --> 06:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
administrative needs and enforcement
 
06:44:18.430 --> 06:44:18.440 align:start position:0%
needs to uh to carry out that mission
 
06:44:20.868 --> 06:44:20.878 align:start position:0%
okay questions from the
 
06:44:23.990 --> 06:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
committee representative bney yeah so
 
06:44:25.430 --> 06:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the fiscal note in
 
06:44:27.708 --> 06:44:27.718 align:start position:0%
the in the back of the bill in terms of
 
06:44:30.350 --> 06:44:30.360 align:start position:0%
the cost of running the store yes sir
 
06:44:32.510 --> 06:44:32.520 align:start position:0%
you you estimate for the 10 store 7.8
 
06:44:35.190 --> 06:44:35.200 align:start position:0%
million startup costs first that's the
 
06:44:38.548 --> 06:44:38.558 align:start position:0%
first thing yes and then the annual cost
 
06:44:40.110 --> 06:44:40.120 align:start position:0%
and that I'm assuming that the number
 
06:44:43.070 --> 06:44:43.080 align:start position:0%
here the 3.3 million is is the annual
 
06:44:46.708 --> 06:44:46.718 align:start position:0%
cost for the 10 stores yes sir okay
 
06:44:49.708 --> 06:44:49.718 align:start position:0%
so so uh
 
06:44:53.750 --> 06:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
$337,000 if you divide by 10 per store
 
06:44:56.788 --> 06:44:56.798 align:start position:0%
correct yes and some of this is is is
 
06:44:59.510 --> 06:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
obviously based on estimates we the
 
06:45:01.510 --> 06:45:01.520 align:start position:0%
commission really has no experience in
 
06:45:04.230 --> 06:45:04.240 align:start position:0%
this area and so we're we're trying to
 
06:45:07.230 --> 06:45:07.240 align:start position:0%
forecast and project uh what would be
 
06:45:09.948 --> 06:45:09.958 align:start position:0%
what would be needed um one of the
 
06:45:12.510 --> 06:45:12.520 align:start position:0%
things that I'll I'd be happy to point
 
06:45:15.830 --> 06:45:15.840 align:start position:0%
you to is on page 11 of the bill um
 
06:45:18.948 --> 06:45:18.958 align:start position:0%
lines 22 through
 
06:45:22.468 --> 06:45:22.478 align:start position:0%
28 um and we
 
06:45:26.230 --> 06:45:26.240 align:start position:0%
would probably indicate that this is not
 
06:45:29.070 --> 06:45:29.080 align:start position:0%
written properly to indicate what it is
 
06:45:31.230 --> 06:45:31.240 align:start position:0%
that we'd like to do because we have no
 
06:45:32.590 --> 06:45:32.600 align:start position:0%
experience the commission has no
 
06:45:36.030 --> 06:45:36.040 align:start position:0%
experience in this area uh the chairman
 
06:45:37.788 --> 06:45:37.798 align:start position:0%
felt that it was important that if this
 
06:45:41.510 --> 06:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
were to become law that we would uh
 
06:45:45.070 --> 06:45:45.080 align:start position:0%
provide an RFP for someone who would
 
06:45:47.190 --> 06:45:47.200 align:start position:0%
fulfill the roles that we would we've
 
06:45:50.030 --> 06:45:50.040 align:start position:0%
been calling inside a negotiat somebody
 
06:45:52.590 --> 06:45:52.600 align:start position:0%
who knew the business somebody who could
 
06:45:54.590 --> 06:45:54.600 align:start position:0%
provide advice to the commission someone
 
06:45:58.990 --> 06:45:59.000 align:start position:0%
who could provide training um advice on
 
06:46:01.110 --> 06:46:01.120 align:start position:0%
purchasing um somebody who has the
 
06:46:04.350 --> 06:46:04.360 align:start position:0%
skills and backgrounds in this area so
 
06:46:06.430 --> 06:46:06.440 align:start position:0%
that um we would be able to carry out
 
06:46:09.708 --> 06:46:09.718 align:start position:0%
the legislatively prescribed mission on
 
06:46:12.468 --> 06:46:12.478 align:start position:0%
page 11 you'll see the Bold language it
 
06:46:14.270 --> 06:46:14.280 align:start position:0%
says the commission may select and
 
06:46:17.590 --> 06:46:17.600 align:start position:0%
retain additional investigators through
 
06:46:20.150 --> 06:46:20.160 align:start position:0%
a competitive bidding process approved
 
06:46:22.948 --> 06:46:22.958 align:start position:0%
by the governor and executive Council um
 
06:46:24.670 --> 06:46:24.680 align:start position:0%
the use of the word investigator there
 
06:46:29.310 --> 06:46:29.320 align:start position:0%
is is it's just not the right word um as
 
06:46:31.270 --> 06:46:31.280 align:start position:0%
you probably are aware liquor
 
06:46:32.948 --> 06:46:32.958 align:start position:0%
investigators are law enforcement
 
06:46:34.548 --> 06:46:34.558 align:start position:0%
Personnel who are hired under the
 
06:46:37.548 --> 06:46:37.558 align:start position:0%
state's Personnel department rules and
 
06:46:39.708 --> 06:46:39.718 align:start position:0%
have a completely different function
 
06:46:42.510 --> 06:46:42.520 align:start position:0%
than what would be prescribed here so we
 
06:46:45.830 --> 06:46:45.840 align:start position:0%
feel that that that wording is an error
 
06:46:48.750 --> 06:46:48.760 align:start position:0%
and uh that would need to be uh flushed
 
06:46:50.948 --> 06:46:50.958 align:start position:0%
out and changed if this bill were to
 
06:46:53.430 --> 06:46:53.440 align:start position:0%
become law before it became law if
 
06:46:57.030 --> 06:46:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:00.030 --> 06:47:00.040 align:start position:0%
decided representative Brony okay thank
 
06:47:04.270 --> 06:47:04.280 align:start position:0%
you yeah I I I saw that um I did I did
 
06:47:06.788 --> 06:47:06.798 align:start position:0%
speak to Aiden offline ahead of time
 
06:47:08.830 --> 06:47:08.840 align:start position:0%
just to get a sense of where you were
 
06:47:11.030 --> 06:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
coming from and also to ask for the
 
06:47:12.548 --> 06:47:12.558 align:start position:0%
revenue side of this which we'll get to
 
06:47:15.788 --> 06:47:15.798 align:start position:0%
in a second
 
06:47:18.948 --> 06:47:18.958 align:start position:0%
so but the cost the 3.3 million doesn't
 
06:47:20.948 --> 06:47:20.958 align:start position:0%
really include well it does include it
 
06:47:23.150 --> 06:47:23.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't include the product costs it
 
06:47:25.150 --> 06:47:25.160 align:start position:0%
does doesn't this is just the employees
 
06:47:27.190 --> 06:47:27.200 align:start position:0%
the the plant the heat the lights and
 
06:47:30.670 --> 06:47:30.680 align:start position:0%
all that yes um so it doesn't include
 
06:47:32.628 --> 06:47:32.638 align:start position:0%
the product cost but it also doesn't
 
06:47:34.670 --> 06:47:34.680 align:start position:0%
include any the overhead from The Liquor
 
06:47:36.910 --> 06:47:36.920 align:start position:0%
Commission itself I mean the pration of
 
06:47:41.510 --> 06:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
the uh perhaps of the uh commissioner's
 
06:47:44.270 --> 06:47:44.280 align:start position:0%
time your time uh then we have to talk
 
06:47:48.030 --> 06:47:48.040 align:start position:0%
about and I see uh Mr abanian sitting
 
06:47:48.040 --> 06:47:49.230 align:start position:0%
about and I see uh Mr abanian sitting
here

06:47:49.230 --> 06:47:49.240 align:start position:0%
here
 
06:47:51.468 --> 06:47:51.478 align:start position:0%
enforcement uh I'm assuming
 
06:47:53.430 --> 06:47:53.440 align:start position:0%
enforcement's going to have a role is
 
06:47:56.670 --> 06:47:56.680 align:start position:0%
that correct in your model yes
 
06:47:59.310 --> 06:47:59.320 align:start position:0%
sir and but that in your in your numbers
 
06:48:02.468 --> 06:48:02.478 align:start position:0%
is is cost is that
 
06:48:05.150 --> 06:48:05.160 align:start position:0%
cost in these numbers the enforcement
 
06:48:09.750 --> 06:48:09.760 align:start position:0%
portion a pration of enforcement time uh
 
06:48:11.910 --> 06:48:11.920 align:start position:0%
thank you representative sorry about
 
06:48:15.230 --> 06:48:15.240 align:start position:0%
that um for the model that was presented
 
06:48:18.510 --> 06:48:18.520 align:start position:0%
to us in the Bill yes but what was what
 
06:48:22.030 --> 06:48:22.040 align:start position:0%
I have been listening to with other
 
06:48:25.190 --> 06:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
factions um um more
 
06:48:27.270 --> 06:48:27.280 align:start position:0%
privatization is going to create more
 
06:48:29.230 --> 06:48:29.240 align:start position:0%
venues which is going to create more
 
06:48:31.990 --> 06:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
oversight and and for a lack of a better
 
06:48:36.628 --> 06:48:36.638 align:start position:0%
term a heavier lift so and we we would
 
06:48:39.750 --> 06:48:39.760 align:start position:0%
make our model mirror whatever model is
 
06:48:42.110 --> 06:48:42.120 align:start position:0%
presented to
 
06:48:45.190 --> 06:48:45.200 align:start position:0%
us yeah I guess follow up follow up I
 
06:48:46.510 --> 06:48:46.520 align:start position:0%
guess guess I'm trying to make sure we
 
06:48:48.868 --> 06:48:48.878 align:start position:0%
have the cost here and then our best
 
06:48:50.190 --> 06:48:50.200 align:start position:0%
estimate of what the revenue is going to
 
06:48:52.590 --> 06:48:52.600 align:start position:0%
be because we're all about the net you
 
06:48:55.230 --> 06:48:55.240 align:start position:0%
know what's the that so so given that
 
06:48:57.230 --> 06:48:57.240 align:start position:0%
point what we were presented in the
 
06:48:59.510 --> 06:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
original bill is a representation of
 
06:49:01.110 --> 06:49:01.120 align:start position:0%
what's in the
 
06:49:03.990 --> 06:49:04.000 align:start position:0%
LSR okay if it expands from there of
 
06:49:05.830 --> 06:49:05.840 align:start position:0%
course everything else is anything so
 
06:49:08.628 --> 06:49:08.638 align:start position:0%
you fail you the cost of enforcements
 
06:49:11.670 --> 06:49:11.680 align:start position:0%
are in this on these
 
06:49:14.628 --> 06:49:14.638 align:start position:0%
estimates the cost of the Personnel
 
06:49:17.510 --> 06:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
attached to it yes okay thank you thank
 
06:49:21.230 --> 06:49:21.240 align:start position:0%
you um and then are we going can I can I
 
06:49:23.150 --> 06:49:23.160 align:start position:0%
lead off with the the question about the
 
06:49:26.190 --> 06:49:26.200 align:start position:0%
revenues the sheet that you handed
 
06:49:29.948 --> 06:49:29.958 align:start position:0%
out so um what I what I glean from that
 
06:49:33.190 --> 06:49:33.200 align:start position:0%
when I look at it is it looks like you
 
06:49:35.270 --> 06:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
the average per capita you came up with
 
06:49:37.230 --> 06:49:37.240 align:start position:0%
kind of like a third of the way down on
 
06:49:42.388 --> 06:49:42.398 align:start position:0%
 
06:49:42.398 --> 06:49:43.910 align:start position:0%
 
3554

06:49:43.910 --> 06:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
3554
 
06:49:46.230 --> 06:49:46.240 align:start position:0%
uh that's that would be Revenue per
 
06:49:48.670 --> 06:49:48.680 align:start position:0%
capita or net revenue per
 
06:49:51.750 --> 06:49:51.760 align:start position:0%
capita no excuse me uh that would be
 
06:49:53.868 --> 06:49:53.878 align:start position:0%
yeah that would be Revenue per capita
 
06:49:57.750 --> 06:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
uh net uh again net revenue per capita
 
06:50:00.190 --> 06:50:00.200 align:start position:0%
so that if we take that 35 am I correct
 
06:50:01.948 --> 06:50:01.958 align:start position:0%
in that first off is that the number we
 
06:50:03.628 --> 06:50:03.638 align:start position:0%
should be using are you referring sir to
 
06:50:06.110 --> 06:50:06.120 align:start position:0%
this this sheet yes yes um and you're on
 
06:50:09.510 --> 06:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
page one page one on the first
 
06:50:14.150 --> 06:50:14.160 align:start position:0%
uh you say per capital numbers that the
 
06:50:14.160 --> 06:50:15.830 align:start position:0%
uh you say per capital numbers that the
total

06:50:15.830 --> 06:50:15.840 align:start position:0%
total
 
06:50:19.110 --> 06:50:19.120 align:start position:0%
$355 Capal $35 yes
 
06:50:23.430 --> 06:50:23.440 align:start position:0%
sir so if we take that times the let's
 
06:50:25.310 --> 06:50:25.320 align:start position:0%
what the what's the latest census uh
 
06:50:28.590 --> 06:50:28.600 align:start position:0%
1.36 million people in in New Hampshire
 
06:50:30.788 --> 06:50:30.798 align:start position:0%
something like that let's assume that's
 
06:50:33.788 --> 06:50:33.798 align:start position:0%
the number if we multiply it times to 35
 
06:50:37.070 --> 06:50:37.080 align:start position:0%
that's uh that would be an estimate of
 
06:50:39.788 --> 06:50:39.798 align:start position:0%
uh 48 million in change 48 million is
 
06:50:42.788 --> 06:50:42.798 align:start position:0%
that 50 I just said the numbers on like
 
06:50:48.708 --> 06:50:48.718 align:start position:0%
yes so okay so do you think that's the
 
06:50:51.350 --> 06:50:51.360 align:start position:0%
transfer that's your best estimate of
 
06:50:53.628 --> 06:50:53.638 align:start position:0%
the what you think the transfer would be
 
06:50:56.990 --> 06:50:57.000 align:start position:0%
to the to the state from Liquor
 
06:51:00.708 --> 06:51:00.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:03.708 --> 06:51:03.718 align:start position:0%
profit that's the best estimate that our
 
06:51:05.868 --> 06:51:05.878 align:start position:0%
Chief Financial Officer could could
 
06:51:08.830 --> 06:51:08.840 align:start position:0%
develop uh based upon what we know and
 
06:51:11.150 --> 06:51:11.160 align:start position:0%
looking at the surrounding states and
 
06:51:13.708 --> 06:51:13.718 align:start position:0%
what they've done
 
06:51:15.910 --> 06:51:15.920 align:start position:0%
um certainly there's some questions
 
06:51:18.788 --> 06:51:18.798 align:start position:0%
about pricing as you've as you've heard
 
06:51:21.310 --> 06:51:21.320 align:start position:0%
uh and discussed and how those prices
 
06:51:24.190 --> 06:51:24.200 align:start position:0%
are uh set representative Aly I believe
 
06:51:27.190 --> 06:51:27.200 align:start position:0%
asked a question about pricing and uh we
 
06:51:29.510 --> 06:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
would need to If This Were to become
 
06:51:31.510 --> 06:51:31.520 align:start position:0%
statute of course we would need to
 
06:51:34.388 --> 06:51:34.398 align:start position:0%
proceed to Ru making where a great deal
 
06:51:37.190 --> 06:51:37.200 align:start position:0%
of the detail on how this would be done
 
06:51:40.670 --> 06:51:40.680 align:start position:0%
would be flushed out and of course uh
 
06:51:43.590 --> 06:51:43.600 align:start position:0%
public notice and comment uh for that
 
06:51:46.350 --> 06:51:46.360 align:start position:0%
process and according to the bill we we
 
06:51:49.910 --> 06:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
would have a very tight timeline uh in
 
06:51:53.468 --> 06:51:53.478 align:start position:0%
which to carry these out um it gives us
 
06:51:56.750 --> 06:51:56.760 align:start position:0%
some pretty hefty uh timetables to
 
06:51:59.110 --> 06:51:59.120 align:start position:0%
follow uh to bring this online If This
 
06:52:01.948 --> 06:52:01.958 align:start position:0%
Were to become law so one more followup
 
06:52:04.830 --> 06:52:04.840 align:start position:0%
I let others do so so the way she got at
 
06:52:07.070 --> 06:52:07.080 align:start position:0%
this number your Chief fiscal officer
 
06:52:10.070 --> 06:52:10.080 align:start position:0%
yes right of liquor is she took a look
 
06:52:11.468 --> 06:52:11.478 align:start position:0%
at all the states
 
06:52:14.150 --> 06:52:14.160 align:start position:0%
here and I guess looked at what the per
 
06:52:17.430 --> 06:52:17.440 align:start position:0%
per capita was of
 
06:52:20.070 --> 06:52:20.080 align:start position:0%
taxes right not because this is a unique
 
06:52:21.830 --> 06:52:21.840 align:start position:0%
model we're talking about here but of
 
06:52:25.628 --> 06:52:25.638 align:start position:0%
taxes and came up with the $35 is that
 
06:52:28.350 --> 06:52:28.360 align:start position:0%
correct yes sir okay that's all just
 
06:52:31.868 --> 06:52:31.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:35.150 --> 06:52:35.160 align:start position:0%
you represent line thank you simple
 
06:52:37.270 --> 06:52:37.280 align:start position:0%
question you were talking earlier about
 
06:52:41.670 --> 06:52:41.680 align:start position:0%
page 11 line 25 where we improperly use
 
06:52:44.510 --> 06:52:44.520 align:start position:0%
the word uh additional investigators
 
06:52:46.230 --> 06:52:46.240 align:start position:0%
would an appropriate phrase for that be
 
06:52:46.240 --> 06:52:47.468 align:start position:0%
would an appropriate phrase for that be
Market

06:52:47.468 --> 06:52:47.478 align:start position:0%
Market
 
06:52:49.590 --> 06:52:49.600 align:start position:0%
Consultants uh could be anything but
 
06:52:51.990 --> 06:52:52.000 align:start position:0%
investigator anything but investigator
 
06:52:54.468 --> 06:52:54.478 align:start position:0%
thank you uh and and that what we're
 
06:52:57.230 --> 06:52:57.240 align:start position:0%
really looking for is as again to to
 
06:52:59.708 --> 06:52:59.718 align:start position:0%
find a if if this were to become law to
 
06:53:01.830 --> 06:53:01.840 align:start position:0%
find a person who who would have that
 
06:53:05.110 --> 06:53:05.120 align:start position:0%
expertise um we envision putting out an
 
06:53:09.910 --> 06:53:09.920 align:start position:0%
RFP um putting out the criteria the the
 
06:53:11.548 --> 06:53:11.558 align:start position:0%
needs the experience that a person would
 
06:53:13.430 --> 06:53:13.440 align:start position:0%
need to have bring this to governor and
 
06:53:16.110 --> 06:53:16.120 align:start position:0%
Council for approval uh a completely
 
06:53:18.468 --> 06:53:18.478 align:start position:0%
transparent process so that the person
 
06:53:22.468 --> 06:53:22.478 align:start position:0%
who is uh selected If This Were to occur
 
06:53:25.150 --> 06:53:25.160 align:start position:0%
uh would have the the uh experience
 
06:53:27.990 --> 06:53:28.000 align:start position:0%
knowledge uh to Aid the Commission in
 
06:53:29.948 --> 06:53:29.958 align:start position:0%
making sure that this was carried out to
 
06:53:32.510 --> 06:53:32.520 align:start position:0%
the best of our ability so Mr chair so
 
06:53:34.230 --> 06:53:34.240 align:start position:0%
if I can just follow up so if I change
 
06:53:35.708 --> 06:53:35.718 align:start position:0%
that line to read the commission may
 
06:53:38.270 --> 06:53:38.280 align:start position:0%
select and retain Market Consultants
 
06:53:40.548 --> 06:53:40.558 align:start position:0%
through a competitive bidding process
 
06:53:41.948 --> 06:53:41.958 align:start position:0%
that would meet your goal to be able to
 
06:53:43.468 --> 06:53:43.478 align:start position:0%
find a market consultant who knew the
 
06:53:45.788 --> 06:53:45.798 align:start position:0%
industry and would be able to advise you
 
06:53:47.708 --> 06:53:47.718 align:start position:0%
accordingly on how to proceed I believe
 
06:53:49.388 --> 06:53:49.398 align:start position:0%
that would be sir thank
 
06:53:56.910 --> 06:53:56.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:59.628 --> 06:53:59.638 align:start position:0%
sorry uh for one
 
06:54:04.670 --> 06:54:04.680 align:start position:0%
thing uh the this survey is trying to
 
06:54:07.910 --> 06:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
use the tax revenue there and all of
 
06:54:10.190 --> 06:54:10.200 align:start position:0%
these states have different forms of tax
 
06:54:12.510 --> 06:54:12.520 align:start position:0%
revenue and I've got questions about
 
06:54:14.708 --> 06:54:14.718 align:start position:0%
whether three of them are also adding a
 
06:54:18.868 --> 06:54:18.878 align:start position:0%
sales tax on top of the marijuana tax
 
06:54:22.910 --> 06:54:22.920 align:start position:0%
that uh that are in this list but uh
 
06:54:27.468 --> 06:54:27.478 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be better to start from
 
06:54:29.868 --> 06:54:29.878 align:start position:0%
sales in each
 
06:54:33.548 --> 06:54:33.558 align:start position:0%
state even though probably the price
 
06:54:35.468 --> 06:54:35.478 align:start position:0%
differs in
 
06:54:38.350 --> 06:54:38.360 align:start position:0%
different different places too or to
 
06:54:42.310 --> 06:54:42.320 align:start position:0%
start as they started with the Dr last
 
06:54:48.430 --> 06:54:48.440 align:start position:0%
time as uh the amount consumed per
 
06:54:52.350 --> 06:54:52.360 align:start position:0%
capita which I think has to come through
 
06:54:55.270 --> 06:54:55.280 align:start position:0%
public public health
 
06:55:00.110 --> 06:55:00.120 align:start position:0%
research on because the model that he's
 
06:55:03.430 --> 06:55:03.440 align:start position:0%
trying to use is totally different from
 
06:55:06.590 --> 06:55:06.600 align:start position:0%
what all these other states are doing
 
06:55:09.350 --> 06:55:09.360 align:start position:0%
and he's claiming that this is going to
 
06:55:14.150 --> 06:55:14.160 align:start position:0%
provide a greater ability of
 
06:55:18.270 --> 06:55:18.280 align:start position:0%
profit than we would get than we would
 
06:55:21.590 --> 06:55:21.600 align:start position:0%
get if we followed the traditional tax
 
06:55:21.600 --> 06:55:24.628 align:start position:0%
get if we followed the traditional tax
models

06:55:24.628 --> 06:55:24.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:27.230 --> 06:55:27.240 align:start position:0%
I'm afraid uh representative I I'm not
 
06:55:29.190 --> 06:55:29.200 align:start position:0%
sure I have the background or experience
 
06:55:32.910 --> 06:55:32.920 align:start position:0%
to provide you with an opinion that
 
06:55:35.350 --> 06:55:35.360 align:start position:0%
would would uh be meaningful in this
 
06:55:36.788 --> 06:55:36.798 align:start position:0%
area I think there's a couple of
 
06:55:37.910 --> 06:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
different ways of looking at it
 
06:55:41.430 --> 06:55:41.440 align:start position:0%
certainly if you uh would like us to try
 
06:55:43.910 --> 06:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
to get you a different
 
06:55:48.430 --> 06:55:48.440 align:start position:0%
analysis of potential Revenue I think um
 
06:55:51.110 --> 06:55:51.120 align:start position:0%
you know some of this is based upon this
 
06:55:53.350 --> 06:55:53.360 align:start position:0%
is the best we could provide
 
06:55:55.628 --> 06:55:55.638 align:start position:0%
based upon the models that exist within
 
06:55:57.628 --> 06:55:57.638 align:start position:0%
the states and our model the model
 
06:55:59.110 --> 06:55:59.120 align:start position:0%
that's being proposed in this bill of
 
06:56:00.548 --> 06:56:00.558 align:start position:0%
course is certainly different than any
 
06:56:04.708 --> 06:56:04.718 align:start position:0%
of these so anything that we would do
 
06:56:06.110 --> 06:56:06.120 align:start position:0%
would would
 
06:56:09.388 --> 06:56:09.398 align:start position:0%
be our best guess best estimate if you
 
06:56:12.350 --> 06:56:12.360 align:start position:0%
will um and if you feel you would like
 
06:56:15.750 --> 06:56:15.760 align:start position:0%
to have this um estimate provided using
 
06:56:18.270 --> 06:56:18.280 align:start position:0%
different criteria we'll certainly try
 
06:56:21.670 --> 06:56:21.680 align:start position:0%
to get that to you um I think it would
 
06:56:24.708 --> 06:56:24.718 align:start position:0%
be helpful to have look at it a couple
 
06:56:28.548 --> 06:56:28.558 align:start position:0%
of different ways to get an idea of the
 
06:56:33.548 --> 06:56:33.558 align:start position:0%
range your range is 50 million
 
06:56:36.430 --> 06:56:36.440 align:start position:0%
which I calculated considerably less
 
06:56:38.990 --> 06:56:39.000 align:start position:0%
than that just from Colorado a number of
 
06:56:43.350 --> 06:56:43.360 align:start position:0%
years ago uh
 
06:56:48.430 --> 06:56:48.440 align:start position:0%
but on their uh the sponsors range is
 
06:56:54.310 --> 06:56:54.320 align:start position:0%
260 to 360 million so that's pretty
 
06:56:58.350 --> 06:56:58.360 align:start position:0%
different uh but also my other question
 
06:57:03.628 --> 06:57:03.638 align:start position:0%
was about you do a really good job with
 
06:57:06.388 --> 06:57:06.398 align:start position:0%
what is pretty much a non-p perishable
 
06:57:09.110 --> 06:57:09.120 align:start position:0%
product that you can buy anywhere in the
 
06:57:13.628 --> 06:57:13.638 align:start position:0%
country and you figure out what are the
 
06:57:16.788 --> 06:57:16.798 align:start position:0%
best uh the product that is going to
 
06:57:20.150 --> 06:57:20.160 align:start position:0%
sell best in New Hampshire stores and
 
06:57:22.910 --> 06:57:22.920 align:start position:0%
you find a way to get it except for the
 
06:57:24.830 --> 06:57:24.840 align:start position:0%
one that I want most at this point but
 
06:57:26.830 --> 06:57:26.840 align:start position:0%
anyway tell us tell her what it is
 
06:57:28.548 --> 06:57:28.558 align:start position:0%
representative we'll get I have told a
 
06:57:31.070 --> 06:57:31.080 align:start position:0%
number of store clerks and they say they
 
06:57:34.910 --> 06:57:34.920 align:start position:0%
just aren't doing it but uh
 
06:57:38.750 --> 06:57:38.760 align:start position:0%
so and but you do a really good job of
 
06:57:41.468 --> 06:57:41.478 align:start position:0%
that and you've outcompeted Total Wines
 
06:57:43.430 --> 06:57:43.440 align:start position:0%
which is quite
 
06:57:49.788 --> 06:57:49.798 align:start position:0%
quite remarkable on but this is based on
 
06:57:52.830 --> 06:57:52.840 align:start position:0%
an Agricultural Product which is as the
 
06:57:56.230 --> 06:57:56.240 align:start position:0%
previous people said perishable it's not
 
06:57:58.590 --> 06:57:58.600 align:start position:0%
being grown outside so it's not quite as
 
06:58:01.270 --> 06:58:01.280 align:start position:0%
erratic as regular agriculture but it
 
06:58:03.548 --> 06:58:03.558 align:start position:0%
still can be somewhat
 
06:58:06.230 --> 06:58:06.240 align:start position:0%
erratic and
 
06:58:09.070 --> 06:58:09.080 align:start position:0%
um and with limited you have to be
 
06:58:11.430 --> 06:58:11.440 align:start position:0%
limited to inside people who are growing
 
06:58:12.868 --> 06:58:12.878 align:start position:0%
inside of the
 
06:58:17.590 --> 06:58:17.600 align:start position:0%
State uh are you saying that the price
 
06:58:21.388 --> 06:58:21.398 align:start position:0%
point that you that you'd have to use
 
06:58:23.230 --> 06:58:23.240 align:start position:0%
which is key to
 
06:58:28.150 --> 06:58:28.160 align:start position:0%
what what the revenues would probably be
 
06:58:31.830 --> 06:58:31.840 align:start position:0%
uh would be something that the market
 
06:58:34.150 --> 06:58:34.160 align:start position:0%
consultant would have to try to figure
 
06:58:36.628 --> 06:58:36.638 align:start position:0%
out so the market consultant would have
 
06:58:40.310 --> 06:58:40.320 align:start position:0%
to understand uh cannabis growing quite
 
06:58:43.350 --> 06:58:43.360 align:start position:0%
a quite well in the North in in the
 
06:58:46.030 --> 06:58:46.040 align:start position:0%
north part of the United States I I'd
 
06:58:47.388 --> 06:58:47.398 align:start position:0%
say that's a very fair comment
 
06:58:48.590 --> 06:58:48.600 align:start position:0%
representative that you know the
 
06:58:50.510 --> 06:58:50.520 align:start position:0%
commission does not have the experience
 
06:58:54.070 --> 06:58:54.080 align:start position:0%
in this area and would need to rely upon
 
06:58:56.388 --> 06:58:56.398 align:start position:0%
this person whomever they may be to
 
06:58:59.670 --> 06:58:59.680 align:start position:0%
provide um solid guidance and Direction
 
06:59:02.990 --> 06:59:03.000 align:start position:0%
on how to where to acquire it how much
 
06:59:06.350 --> 06:59:06.360 align:start position:0%
to pay for it what the price it at uh
 
06:59:08.510 --> 06:59:08.520 align:start position:0%
every aspect of it that
 
06:59:12.948 --> 06:59:12.958 align:start position:0%
um that we we are not aware of now um as
 
06:59:16.788 --> 06:59:16.798 align:start position:0%
you pointed out we have over 75 years of
 
06:59:18.868 --> 06:59:18.878 align:start position:0%
experience with alcohol and all that all
 
06:59:21.150 --> 06:59:21.160 align:start position:0%
of that but this would uh while the
 
06:59:22.750 --> 06:59:22.760 align:start position:0%
model might be similar and its
 
06:59:24.628 --> 06:59:24.638 align:start position:0%
appearance and the fact that it's a
 
06:59:27.830 --> 06:59:27.840 align:start position:0%
control type of product uh we don't have
 
06:59:31.150 --> 06:59:31.160 align:start position:0%
any any experience with this area so we
 
06:59:33.750 --> 06:59:33.760 align:start position:0%
would rely on that negotiat or that
 
06:59:37.628 --> 06:59:37.638 align:start position:0%
other advisor to give us a direction in
 
06:59:42.270 --> 06:59:42.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:45.548 --> 06:59:45.558 align:start position:0%
you question first first of all anybody
 
06:59:49.548 --> 06:59:49.558 align:start position:0%
else have question may may I ask Sor may
 
06:59:52.150 --> 06:59:52.160 align:start position:0%
I Mr chairman before may I ask
 
06:59:53.868 --> 06:59:53.878 align:start position:0%
representative Aly if if if you would be
 
06:59:57.270 --> 06:59:57.280 align:start position:0%
willing to provide me with the type of
 
07:00:00.190 --> 07:00:00.200 align:start position:0%
assessment you would like to on will
 
07:00:02.150 --> 07:00:02.160 align:start position:0%

you back some different figures and
 
07:00:08.788 --> 07:00:08.798 align:start position:0%
using different criteria if you would
 
07:00:08.798 --> 07:00:17.030 align:start position:0%
using different criteria if you would
like

07:00:17.030 --> 07:00:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:20.628 --> 07:00:20.638 align:start position:0%
thank and I think of course she will say
 
07:00:22.270 --> 07:00:22.280 align:start position:0%
how how would they like us to look look
 
07:00:24.548 --> 07:00:24.558 align:start position:0%
at it what from you know from a what
 
07:00:26.990 --> 07:00:27.000 align:start position:0%
perspective to do the calculation so if
 
07:00:29.430 --> 07:00:29.440 align:start position:0%
you would be willing to share that uh
 
07:00:30.708 --> 07:00:30.718 align:start position:0%
we'll make sure we try to get you the
 
07:00:32.430 --> 07:00:32.440 align:start position:0%
best estimates we
 
07:00:36.070 --> 07:00:36.080 align:start position:0%
can thank you Mr chairman represent
 
07:00:38.590 --> 07:00:38.600 align:start position:0%
Ames thank you
 
07:00:41.548 --> 07:00:41.558 align:start position:0%
uh so right I think at the beginning of
 
07:00:44.388 --> 07:00:44.398 align:start position:0%
your testimony if I remember correctly
 
07:00:49.310 --> 07:00:49.320 align:start position:0%
um you uh said something about how in
 
07:00:54.270 --> 07:00:54.280 align:start position:0%
entering into this new um field you the
 
07:00:56.230 --> 07:00:56.240 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission wanted to
 
07:00:59.230 --> 07:00:59.240 align:start position:0%
keep clearly in
 
07:01:02.430 --> 07:01:02.440 align:start position:0%
Focus it's primary the business that
 
07:01:04.788 --> 07:01:04.798 align:start position:0%
you've worked on for 75 years and you've
 
07:01:08.468 --> 07:01:08.478 align:start position:0%
developed a standard and a success and
 
07:01:10.670 --> 07:01:10.680 align:start position:0%
you didn't want you'd want to be sure
 
07:01:13.310 --> 07:01:13.320 align:start position:0%
that whatever you did didn't undermine
 
07:01:16.708 --> 07:01:16.718 align:start position:0%
that um and I my question to you if I've
 
07:01:19.628 --> 07:01:19.638 align:start position:0%
got that right is uh what concerns might
 
07:01:22.910 --> 07:01:22.920 align:start position:0%
you have what what uh what might
 
07:01:25.190 --> 07:01:25.200 align:start position:0%
entering into this new
 
07:01:30.388 --> 07:01:30.398 align:start position:0%
Venture um do to the The Venture that's
 
07:01:33.670 --> 07:01:33.680 align:start position:0%
right now everything for
 
07:01:37.110 --> 07:01:37.120 align:start position:0%
you well I believe sir that uh under the
 
07:01:39.990 --> 07:01:40.000 align:start position:0%
direction of the commission chairman mik
 
07:01:42.430 --> 07:01:42.440 align:start position:0%
the and it and his staff the commission
 
07:01:48.350 --> 07:01:48.360 align:start position:0%
has worked very hard to um set up and
 
07:01:50.310 --> 07:01:50.320 align:start position:0%
show the consumers that New Hampshire is
 
07:01:53.388 --> 07:01:53.398 align:start position:0%
a good place to visit and that we have a
 
07:01:55.190 --> 07:01:55.200 align:start position:0%
great selection of family-friendly
 
07:01:58.350 --> 07:01:58.360 align:start position:0%
businesses a place where for example uh
 
07:02:01.030 --> 07:02:01.040 align:start position:0%
visitors might bring their children in
 
07:02:04.670 --> 07:02:04.680 align:start position:0%
and and and see the stores are set up
 
07:02:12.030 --> 07:02:12.040 align:start position:0%
with uh I think Tastefully Etc um and we
 
07:02:15.628 --> 07:02:15.638 align:start position:0%
don't know what how the public would
 
07:02:19.990 --> 07:02:20.000 align:start position:0%
receive now uh having these two products
 
07:02:24.510 --> 07:02:24.520 align:start position:0%
in one location uh um that it may it's
 
07:02:27.310 --> 07:02:27.320 align:start position:0%
it's possible that uh some members of
 
07:02:29.590 --> 07:02:29.600 align:start position:0%
the public who have enjoyed shopping at
 
07:02:32.548 --> 07:02:32.558 align:start position:0%
the liquor Wine and Liquor Outlets might
 
07:02:35.150 --> 07:02:35.160 align:start position:0%
say I'm not going to in there I I I'm
 
07:02:36.830 --> 07:02:36.840 align:start position:0%
not going to go in there they're selling
 
07:02:39.788 --> 07:02:39.798 align:start position:0%
a product that I'm opposed to personally
 
07:02:41.310 --> 07:02:41.320 align:start position:0%
that they say we're not we're not going
 
07:02:44.788 --> 07:02:44.798 align:start position:0%
to stop here now and I think um the
 
07:02:46.948 --> 07:02:46.958 align:start position:0%
concern is that we want to make sure
 
07:02:49.590 --> 07:02:49.600 align:start position:0%
that the brand identification of the
 
07:02:52.030 --> 07:02:52.040 align:start position:0%
liquor uh and wine outlets is not
 
07:02:54.750 --> 07:02:54.760 align:start position:0%
tarnished or compromised in any way that
 
07:02:56.430 --> 07:02:56.440 align:start position:0%
would have a negative impact on the
 
07:02:59.910 --> 07:02:59.920 align:start position:0%
revenues that the legislature relies on
 
07:03:02.230 --> 07:03:02.240 align:start position:0%
for that so so therefore the decision
 
07:03:05.388 --> 07:03:05.398 align:start position:0%
was made uh if we're going to be tasked
 
07:03:08.548 --> 07:03:08.558 align:start position:0%
with this then we're going to uh develop
 
07:03:11.230 --> 07:03:11.240 align:start position:0%
a separate location uh separate
 
07:03:11.240 --> 07:03:12.868 align:start position:0%
a separate location uh separate
locations

07:03:12.868 --> 07:03:12.878 align:start position:0%
locations
 
07:03:17.510 --> 07:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
um separate identities uh and and taking
 
07:03:19.230 --> 07:03:19.240 align:start position:0%
from the models I know it was discussed
 
07:03:21.350 --> 07:03:21.360 align:start position:0%
in the budgets about advertising and a
 
07:03:23.150 --> 07:03:23.160 align:start position:0%
few other things I mean the model that
 
07:03:24.750 --> 07:03:24.760 align:start position:0%
was presented to you was kind of the
 
07:03:27.548 --> 07:03:27.558 align:start position:0%
model that is from liquor you know this
 
07:03:29.990 --> 07:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
advertising there promotions this things
 
07:03:31.948 --> 07:03:31.958 align:start position:0%
of that nature and certainly it's public
 
07:03:34.548 --> 07:03:34.558 align:start position:0%
policy if if if you decided that that
 
07:03:37.510 --> 07:03:37.520 align:start position:0%
was not appropriate then obviously the
 
07:03:40.510 --> 07:03:40.520 align:start position:0%
bill would be amended to or the uh I
 
07:03:41.750 --> 07:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
don't believe the bill actually has
 
07:03:45.350 --> 07:03:45.360 align:start position:0%
anything to do with that in there so um
 
07:03:47.510 --> 07:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
but that's that's part of the decision
 
07:03:50.190 --> 07:03:50.200 align:start position:0%
our fiscal worksheet shows an
 
07:03:53.990 --> 07:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
appropriation of 50 .8 million I believe
 
07:03:57.468 --> 07:03:57.478 align:start position:0%
is what it is that we were uh providing
 
07:04:01.270 --> 07:04:01.280 align:start position:0%
with the cost to start up um as opposed
 
07:04:02.388 --> 07:04:02.398 align:start position:0%
to the 14
 
07:04:04.990 --> 07:04:05.000 align:start position:0%
million so there's certainly a
 
07:04:08.510 --> 07:04:08.520 align:start position:0%
difference there um that would be need
 
07:04:11.430 --> 07:04:11.440 align:start position:0%
to be made up someplace
 
07:04:15.948 --> 07:04:15.958 align:start position:0%
so thank you sir further further
 
07:04:20.670 --> 07:04:20.680 align:start position:0%
questions so thank you Mr chair um I
 
07:04:22.708 --> 07:04:22.718 align:start position:0%
think we got to remember now now is when
 
07:04:24.590 --> 07:04:24.600 align:start position:0%
we do the revenue and I did talk to your
 
07:04:27.510 --> 07:04:27.520 align:start position:0%
CFO about this and I said you are you
 
07:04:30.468 --> 07:04:30.478 align:start position:0%
going to estimate based on with Edibles
 
07:04:32.948 --> 07:04:32.958 align:start position:0%
or without Edibles which is well for now
 
07:04:34.350 --> 07:04:34.360 align:start position:0%
it's going to be because she was
 
07:04:36.388 --> 07:04:36.398 align:start position:0%
confused too as to whether Edibles were
 
07:04:39.510 --> 07:04:39.520 align:start position:0%
in this bill or not and because all the
 
07:04:44.270 --> 07:04:44.280 align:start position:0%
comparative data has Edibles in it so
 
07:04:45.788 --> 07:04:45.798 align:start position:0%
and this bill certainly doesn't have
 
07:04:47.750 --> 07:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
Edibles other than a minor amount that's
 
07:04:49.910 --> 07:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
going to be sold to people with cards
 
07:04:52.670 --> 07:04:52.680 align:start position:0%
which is going to be such a small Manu
 
07:04:55.270 --> 07:04:55.280 align:start position:0%
portion of any sales and I don't even
 
07:04:56.788 --> 07:04:56.798 align:start position:0%
know why we'd have a product on on the
 
07:04:58.670 --> 07:04:58.680 align:start position:0%
shelves because it just create more
 
07:05:01.070 --> 07:05:01.080 align:start position:0%
problems for you guys
 
07:05:04.750 --> 07:05:04.760 align:start position:0%
so I I I think with any analysis we have
 
07:05:06.910 --> 07:05:06.920 align:start position:0%
can do we have to kind of agree on a
 
07:05:09.750 --> 07:05:09.760 align:start position:0%
percent of sales that's Edibles and try
 
07:05:11.310 --> 07:05:11.320 align:start position:0%
to adjust somehow I don't know how we're
 
07:05:14.030 --> 07:05:14.040 align:start position:0%
going to do that but I think we have to
 
07:05:17.150 --> 07:05:17.160 align:start position:0%
say there's no Edibles in this bill and
 
07:05:18.430 --> 07:05:18.440 align:start position:0%
therefore the revenu is going to be a
 
07:05:20.670 --> 07:05:20.680 align:start position:0%
lot less and just for the record and I'm
 
07:05:22.110 --> 07:05:22.120 align:start position:0%
going to talk about this in work work
 
07:05:25.150 --> 07:05:25.160 align:start position:0%
session the the Cannabis the marijuana
 
07:05:29.110 --> 07:05:29.120 align:start position:0%
commission that um I chaired we we
 
07:05:32.030 --> 07:05:32.040 align:start position:0%
estimated any the average was around
 
07:05:34.510 --> 07:05:34.520 align:start position:0%
45.5 million is what we thought would
 
07:05:37.350 --> 07:05:37.360 align:start position:0%
come to the state same ballpark of where
 
07:05:38.510 --> 07:05:38.520 align:start position:0%
where you are and that that number
 
07:05:41.548 --> 07:05:41.558 align:start position:0%
included Edibles just like this does so
 
07:05:42.788 --> 07:05:42.798 align:start position:0%
I don't think your estimates are that
 
07:05:44.230 --> 07:05:44.240 align:start position:0%
far off but we'll discuss that in work
 
07:05:46.110 --> 07:05:46.120 align:start position:0%
session thank you Mr
 
07:05:49.030 --> 07:05:49.040 align:start position:0%

you but I'm here for two reasons I'm
 
07:07:39.070 --> 07:07:39.080 align:start position:0%
here first and foremost
 
07:07:42.230 --> 07:07:42.240 align:start position:0%
to give a statement that was developed
 
07:07:43.430 --> 07:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
by the
 
07:07:45.510 --> 07:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
therapeutic uh cannabis medical
 
07:07:48.310 --> 07:07:48.320 align:start position:0%
oversight board for the that you know we
 
07:07:51.030 --> 07:07:51.040 align:start position:0%
we work with the HHS and uh work with
 
07:07:54.150 --> 07:07:54.160 align:start position:0%
the legis islative body on um giving
 
07:07:56.548 --> 07:07:56.558 align:start position:0%
education advice and so forth and
 
07:07:58.388 --> 07:07:58.398 align:start position:0%
relevance to the therapeutic cannabis
 
07:08:01.310 --> 07:08:01.320 align:start position:0%
program um good afternoon and thank you
 
07:08:02.750 --> 07:08:02.760 align:start position:0%
for the opportunity to share our
 
07:08:04.590 --> 07:08:04.600 align:start position:0%
thoughts with the committee my name is
 
07:08:05.948 --> 07:08:05.958 align:start position:0%
Heather Marie Brown and I am the
 
07:08:07.548 --> 07:08:07.558 align:start position:0%
co-chair of the therapeutic cannabis
 
07:08:09.670 --> 07:08:09.680 align:start position:0%
medical oversight board and fill the
 
07:08:11.030 --> 07:08:11.040 align:start position:0%
seat of patient
 
07:08:13.070 --> 07:08:13.080 align:start position:0%
representative recently the board took
 
07:08:14.750 --> 07:08:14.760 align:start position:0%
up the discussion in regards to
 
07:08:16.548 --> 07:08:16.558 align:start position:0%
legalization in the state of New
 
07:08:19.030 --> 07:08:19.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and whether or not
 
07:08:21.948 --> 07:08:21.958 align:start position:0%
we whether or not we should issue an
 
07:08:24.670 --> 07:08:24.680 align:start position:0%
opinion on the subject the board voted
 
07:08:26.708 --> 07:08:26.718 align:start position:0%
on this matter and our response is
 
07:08:28.948 --> 07:08:28.958 align:start position:0%
provided the therapeutic cannabis
 
07:08:31.628 --> 07:08:31.638 align:start position:0%
medical oversight board also known as
 
07:08:35.190 --> 07:08:35.200 align:start position:0%
the TCM o feels that even if
 
07:08:37.868 --> 07:08:37.878 align:start position:0%
recreational Cannabis is approved in New
 
07:08:41.270 --> 07:08:41.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that it is important to still
 
07:08:44.628 --> 07:08:44.638 align:start position:0%
maintain a therapeutic cannabis program
 
07:08:48.070 --> 07:08:48.080 align:start position:0%
we cannot as a board stand behind or in
 
07:08:51.030 --> 07:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
good faith give support for any bill
 
07:08:53.510 --> 07:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
that would have a negative impact on the
 
07:08:56.110 --> 07:08:56.120 align:start position:0%
program and most importantly our
 
07:08:58.948 --> 07:08:58.958 align:start position:0%
patients we believe there is a way to
 
07:09:02.070 --> 07:09:02.080 align:start position:0%
have both programs operate without
 
07:09:04.628 --> 07:09:04.638 align:start position:0%
impacting each other or the people they
 
07:09:08.230 --> 07:09:08.240 align:start position:0%
serve on behalf of the TCM o I thank you
 
07:09:10.708 --> 07:09:10.718 align:start position:0%
for your time and if you have any
 
07:09:13.910 --> 07:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
questions to ask me in this capacity has
 
07:09:17.030 --> 07:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
a board member I would be welcome to
 
07:09:20.150 --> 07:09:20.160 align:start position:0%
answer them for you before I add my own
 
07:09:21.830 --> 07:09:21.840 align:start position:0%
two cents as a
 
07:09:24.030 --> 07:09:24.040 align:start position:0%
patient and personal
 
07:09:26.708 --> 07:09:26.718 align:start position:0%
citizen thank you for Testimony
 
07:09:29.030 --> 07:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
questions represent
 
07:09:31.468 --> 07:09:31.478 align:start position:0%
Aaron thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
07:09:34.388 --> 07:09:34.398 align:start position:0%
for coming today so my question is do
 
07:09:37.670 --> 07:09:37.680 align:start position:0%
you feel that um the bill as it is
 
07:09:40.990 --> 07:09:41.000 align:start position:0%
written would financially be a detriment
 
07:09:42.150 --> 07:09:42.160 align:start position:0%
to your
 
07:09:47.548 --> 07:09:47.558 align:start position:0%
program I personally most certainly do I
 
07:09:50.910 --> 07:09:50.920 align:start position:0%
I I see a lot of problems with this bill
 
07:09:53.548 --> 07:09:53.558 align:start position:0%
probably one of my biggest issues with
 
07:09:58.230 --> 07:09:58.240 align:start position:0%
this bill is that you the the state
 
07:10:00.190 --> 07:10:00.200 align:start position:0%
would take on the responsibility of
 
07:10:05.310 --> 07:10:05.320 align:start position:0%
adding very low dose and possibly lesser
 
07:10:08.590 --> 07:10:08.600 align:start position:0%
quality edible products to their shelves
 
07:10:10.270 --> 07:10:10.280 align:start position:0%
that would only be available to
 
07:10:12.910 --> 07:10:12.920 align:start position:0%
Medicinal patients
 
07:10:15.948 --> 07:10:15.958 align:start position:0%
um I heard this word used earlier and
 
07:10:17.670 --> 07:10:17.680 align:start position:0%
the more I thought about it the more I
 
07:10:20.830 --> 07:10:20.840 align:start position:0%
sounded it sounded appropriate but this
 
07:10:24.230 --> 07:10:24.240 align:start position:0%
build literally will poach therapeutic
 
07:10:27.190 --> 07:10:27.200 align:start position:0%
cannabis patients it's giving a patient
 
07:10:30.230 --> 07:10:30.240 align:start position:0%
just enough to get them through the door
 
07:10:33.910 --> 07:10:33.920 align:start position:0%
to go ooh ooh ooh and then when they see
 
07:10:36.830 --> 07:10:36.840 align:start position:0%
the flower that would ultimately be
 
07:10:40.868 --> 07:10:40.878 align:start position:0%
available and because it is being sold
 
07:10:43.510 --> 07:10:43.520 align:start position:0%
taxfree and controlled by the state of
 
07:10:47.110 --> 07:10:47.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that flower would in fact
 
07:10:52.190 --> 07:10:52.200 align:start position:0%
I believe be much less than what
 
07:10:54.868 --> 07:10:54.878 align:start position:0%
purchasing that item would be at our
 
07:10:57.590 --> 07:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
dispensary our dispensaries are
 
07:11:00.388 --> 07:11:00.398 align:start position:0%
nonprofit but has many of you know they
 
07:11:02.910 --> 07:11:02.920 align:start position:0%
are subject to so many rules and
 
07:11:04.868 --> 07:11:04.878 align:start position:0%
regulations set forth by the state of
 
07:11:08.670 --> 07:11:08.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire none of those would apply
 
07:11:11.310 --> 07:11:11.320 align:start position:0%
in this particular bill because of those
 
07:11:13.150 --> 07:11:13.160 align:start position:0%
restrictions because of those rules and
 
07:11:15.548 --> 07:11:15.558 align:start position:0%
regulations it forces the dispensaries
 
07:11:18.430 --> 07:11:18.440 align:start position:0%
to have higher operating costs which in
 
07:11:21.990 --> 07:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
turn means that they are having to sell
 
07:11:24.628 --> 07:11:24.638 align:start position:0%
their products for a considerable amount
 
07:11:27.788 --> 07:11:27.798 align:start position:0%
more money than what they should have to
 
07:11:31.628 --> 07:11:31.638 align:start position:0%
um you know so to open up a recreational
 
07:11:34.510 --> 07:11:34.520 align:start position:0%
store that is already going to be able
 
07:11:38.230 --> 07:11:38.240 align:start position:0%
to sell cannabis at a much cheaper rate
 
07:11:39.990 --> 07:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
and then throw the fact that you're
 
07:11:42.750 --> 07:11:42.760 align:start position:0%
going to have lowd do Edibles in there
 
07:11:45.868 --> 07:11:45.878 align:start position:0%
to try and attract medicinal patients in
 
07:11:45.878 --> 07:11:46.670 align:start position:0%
to try and attract medicinal patients in
the

07:11:46.670 --> 07:11:46.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:11:50.750 --> 07:11:50.760 align:start position:0%
door it literally puts the recreational
 
07:11:52.750 --> 07:11:52.760 align:start position:0%
program and the therapeutic cannabis
 
07:11:55.830 --> 07:11:55.840 align:start position:0%
program in direct competition of one
 
07:11:59.468 --> 07:11:59.478 align:start position:0%
another I truly feel and I am a patient
 
07:12:04.030 --> 07:12:04.040 align:start position:0%
and I will tell you that cost is a huge
 
07:12:07.150 --> 07:12:07.160 align:start position:0%
factor and although I have added
 
07:12:09.350 --> 07:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
experience with cannabis and and I know
 
07:12:12.190 --> 07:12:12.200 align:start position:0%
that my best choices and options when it
 
07:12:14.388 --> 07:12:14.398 align:start position:0%
comes to Quality when it comes to safety
 
07:12:16.430 --> 07:12:16.440 align:start position:0%
when it comes to dosing when it comes to
 
07:12:18.628 --> 07:12:18.638 align:start position:0%
protections is through the therapeutic
 
07:12:21.230 --> 07:12:21.240 align:start position:0%
cannabis program I can tell you that
 
07:12:23.750 --> 07:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
there are thousands of other individuals
 
07:12:26.510 --> 07:12:26.520 align:start position:0%
in the state where their primary focus
 
07:12:29.230 --> 07:12:29.240 align:start position:0%
each day is how am I going to pay for my
 
07:12:32.270 --> 07:12:32.280 align:start position:0%
mens how am I going to pay for my flour
 
07:12:34.510 --> 07:12:34.520 align:start position:0%
how am I going to pay for my bills and
 
07:12:37.948 --> 07:12:37.958 align:start position:0%
if they can determine that oh I can go
 
07:12:40.070 --> 07:12:40.080 align:start position:0%
get this product so much more cheaper
 
07:12:42.590 --> 07:12:42.600 align:start position:0%
through the recreational model then
 
07:12:44.990 --> 07:12:45.000 align:start position:0%
ultimately they would leave or could
 
07:12:46.670 --> 07:12:46.680 align:start position:0%
potentially leave the therapeutic
 
07:12:49.350 --> 07:12:49.360 align:start position:0%
cannabis program without having the
 
07:12:51.468 --> 07:12:51.478 align:start position:0%
realization that they're actually
 
07:12:54.628 --> 07:12:54.638 align:start position:0%
leaving the program and going to a
 
07:12:56.670 --> 07:12:56.680 align:start position:0%
facility that would not be able to
 
07:12:59.190 --> 07:12:59.200 align:start position:0%
provide them education that would not be
 
07:13:01.388 --> 07:13:01.398 align:start position:0%
able to provide them guidance that would
 
07:13:03.430 --> 07:13:03.440 align:start position:0%
not be able to provide them products
 
07:13:05.628 --> 07:13:05.638 align:start position:0%
that were adequate to suit their health
 
07:13:09.230 --> 07:13:09.240 align:start position:0%
and medicinal needs a and you know
 
07:13:11.868 --> 07:13:11.878 align:start position:0%
that's a disservice to them that's a
 
07:13:15.788 --> 07:13:15.798 align:start position:0%
disservice to us and it's so sad because
 
07:13:17.788 --> 07:13:17.798 align:start position:0%
you know for us to sit here and think
 
07:13:19.830 --> 07:13:19.840 align:start position:0%
well you know I'm always going to do the
 
07:13:22.310 --> 07:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
best that I can do for myself no no
 
07:13:24.750 --> 07:13:24.760 align:start position:0%
you're not if it means the difference
 
07:13:27.350 --> 07:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
between having your therapeutic cannabis
 
07:13:29.948 --> 07:13:29.958 align:start position:0%
and making sure your lights stay on you
 
07:13:31.350 --> 07:13:31.360 align:start position:0%
you're going to make sure that your
 
07:13:32.990 --> 07:13:33.000 align:start position:0%
lights stay on but you're also going to
 
07:13:34.990 --> 07:13:35.000 align:start position:0%
figure out a way to get your therapeutic
 
07:13:37.948 --> 07:13:37.958 align:start position:0%
cannabis so if that means that you know
 
07:13:41.948 --> 07:13:41.958 align:start position:0%
can I remind everybody that the policy
 
07:13:44.990 --> 07:13:45.000 align:start position:0%
has been has been voted on we here to
 
07:13:47.628 --> 07:13:47.638 align:start position:0%
talk about the revenue and no I was just
 
07:13:51.430 --> 07:13:51.440 align:start position:0%
answering her question but so to your
 
07:13:53.750 --> 07:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
point Mr chair I was just wondering to
 
07:13:56.310 --> 07:13:56.320 align:start position:0%
see whether there would be a financial
 
07:13:59.310 --> 07:13:59.320 align:start position:0%
impact on our therapeutic cannabis
 
07:14:02.070 --> 07:14:02.080 align:start position:0%
program which the state has something to
 
07:14:04.990 --> 07:14:05.000 align:start position:0%
do with versus um you know how that
 
07:14:07.310 --> 07:14:07.320 align:start position:0%
affect how that would be affecting I
 
07:14:11.590 --> 07:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
think what she has said y thank you and
 
07:14:13.750 --> 07:14:13.760 align:start position:0%
just to clarify and make that a lot
 
07:14:16.510 --> 07:14:16.520 align:start position:0%
shorter yes it would have a financial
 
07:14:20.030 --> 07:14:20.040 align:start position:0%
impact on the program itself and I
 
07:14:22.110 --> 07:14:22.120 align:start position:0%
believe that yes it would have a
 
07:14:29.430 --> 07:14:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:14:32.788 --> 07:14:32.798 align:start position:0%
well any further
 
07:14:34.990 --> 07:14:35.000 align:start position:0%
questions thank
 
07:14:39.150 --> 07:14:39.160 align:start position:0%
you and and can I just can I just um add
 
07:14:41.628 --> 07:14:41.638 align:start position:0%
on has has myself as a personal
 
07:14:45.310 --> 07:14:45.320 align:start position:0%
individual really quickly um I also
 
07:14:47.830 --> 07:14:47.840 align:start position:0%
believe as an individual that the way
 
07:14:50.948 --> 07:14:50.958 align:start position:0%
that this bill currently is written will
 
07:14:54.070 --> 07:14:54.080 align:start position:0%
actually impair Eep economic growth and
 
07:14:56.948 --> 07:14:56.958 align:start position:0%
development for New Hampshire residents
 
07:15:01.030 --> 07:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
and that in some areas it will create
 
07:15:04.910 --> 07:15:04.920 align:start position:0%
discrimination and uh
 
07:15:07.910 --> 07:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
preference preference issues because it
 
07:15:10.708 --> 07:15:10.718 align:start position:0%
only allows for so many cultivators it's
 
07:15:13.230 --> 07:15:13.240 align:start position:0%
only allowing sales to be handled by the
 
07:15:16.150 --> 07:15:16.160 align:start position:0%
state a and it's just limiting a New
 
07:15:18.110 --> 07:15:18.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizen from being able to
 
07:15:21.150 --> 07:15:21.160 align:start position:0%
move forward economically which in turn
 
07:15:23.948 --> 07:15:23.958 align:start position:0%
if they can move forward economically in
 
07:15:26.910 --> 07:15:26.920 align:start position:0%
theory they're putting more money into
 
07:15:29.910 --> 07:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
the state into retail and increasing the
 
07:15:33.510 --> 07:15:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:15:36.990 --> 07:15:37.000 align:start position:0%

07:17:02.190 --> 07:17:02.200 align:start position:0%
I don't
 
07:17:15.350 --> 07:17:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:17:19.788 --> 07:17:19.798 align:start position:0%
do the problem is we have we have people
 
07:17:22.990 --> 07:17:23.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:17:26.310 --> 07:17:26.320 align:start position:0%
commitments and they need to eat before

07:17:32.788 --> 07:17:32.798 align:start position:0%
meeting so uh go ahead Frank uh thank
 
07:17:34.150 --> 07:17:34.160 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman members of the committee
 
07:17:35.430 --> 07:17:35.440 align:start position:0%
for the opportunity to testify my name
 
07:17:37.468 --> 07:17:37.478 align:start position:0%
is Frank kak on policy director with the
 
07:17:41.070 --> 07:17:41.080 align:start position:0%
ACLU of New Hampshire uh just quickly uh
 
07:17:43.510 --> 07:17:43.520 align:start position:0%
three points to make uh one we really
 
07:17:45.670 --> 07:17:45.680 align:start position:0%
like the fact that this revenue is going
 
07:17:47.150 --> 07:17:47.160 align:start position:0%
to go towards supporting mental health
 
07:17:49.070 --> 07:17:49.080 align:start position:0%
and substance use treatment as many of
 
07:17:50.708 --> 07:17:50.718 align:start position:0%
you know New Hampshire's prisons of
 
07:17:52.468 --> 07:17:52.478 align:start position:0%
jails have become de facto mental health
 
07:17:54.670 --> 07:17:54.680 align:start position:0%
and substance use treatment institutions
 
07:17:56.548 --> 07:17:56.558 align:start position:0%
because we failed to adequately fund
 
07:17:58.310 --> 07:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
those services so we think it's an
 
07:18:01.388 --> 07:18:01.398 align:start position:0%
important first step in addition just
 
07:18:03.070 --> 07:18:03.080 align:start position:0%
quickly talking about some of the costs
 
07:18:05.868 --> 07:18:05.878 align:start position:0%
and both the costs associated with um uh
 
07:18:07.590 --> 07:18:07.600 align:start position:0%
that are projected as well as some of
 
07:18:09.788 --> 07:18:09.798 align:start position:0%
the um the costs that are not included
 
07:18:13.070 --> 07:18:13.080 align:start position:0%
in the the fiscal note uh one one point
 
07:18:15.990 --> 07:18:16.000 align:start position:0%
to make is that uh each of the 1494
 
07:18:18.510 --> 07:18:18.520 align:start position:0%
arrests that New Hampshire made in 2020
 
07:18:20.670 --> 07:18:20.680 align:start position:0%
required a judge a clerk law enforcement
 
07:18:23.468 --> 07:18:23.478 align:start position:0%
officers prosecutors back in 2013 the
 
07:18:26.030 --> 07:18:26.040 align:start position:0%
ACLU conducted a nationwide economic
 
07:18:28.230 --> 07:18:28.240 align:start position:0%
analysis on the impact the fiscal impact
 
07:18:30.750 --> 07:18:30.760 align:start position:0%
of marijuana prohibition and we found in
 
07:18:32.270 --> 07:18:32.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that we were spending
 
07:18:36.110 --> 07:18:36.120 align:start position:0%
about 6 $6,500,000 each year in forcing
 
07:18:39.990 --> 07:18:40.000 align:start position:0%
prohibition alone in 2020 we had about
 
07:18:41.310 --> 07:18:41.320 align:start position:0%
half the number of arrests and the
 
07:18:42.910 --> 07:18:42.920 align:start position:0%
methodology is such that we can
 
07:18:44.868 --> 07:18:44.878 align:start position:0%
basically divide that in half so last
 
07:18:47.430 --> 07:18:47.440 align:start position:0%
year in 2020 we spent about $3.25
 
07:18:49.990 --> 07:18:50.000 align:start position:0%
million enforcing prohibition of
 
07:18:53.590 --> 07:18:53.600 align:start position:0%
possession alone in New Hampshire and in
 
07:18:55.948 --> 07:18:55.958 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note it it it assumes that
 
07:18:57.150 --> 07:18:57.160 align:start position:0%
there's going to be increased costs and
 
07:18:58.270 --> 07:18:58.280 align:start position:0%
we heard this from the chief there's
 
07:18:59.468 --> 07:18:59.478 align:start position:0%
going to be increased cost around
 
07:19:01.468 --> 07:19:01.478 align:start position:0%
increased crime increas traffic
 
07:19:03.468 --> 07:19:03.478 align:start position:0%
fatalities and if you'll note in the
 
07:19:06.070 --> 07:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
fact sheet I handed out with footnotes
 
07:19:07.590 --> 07:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
um six
 
07:19:12.350 --> 07:19:12.360 align:start position:0%
through uh 14 that the the um the the
 
07:19:14.670 --> 07:19:14.680 align:start position:0%
projections or the the assertions made
 
07:19:16.548 --> 07:19:16.558 align:start position:0%
by the chief are actually not true not
 
07:19:19.510 --> 07:19:19.520 align:start position:0%
supported by data uh we multiple Studies
 
07:19:20.948 --> 07:19:20.958 align:start position:0%
have found that there's no increase in
 
07:19:23.670 --> 07:19:23.680 align:start position:0%
youth use U multi uh there's been little
 
07:19:25.830 --> 07:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
or no effect in crime rates including a
 
07:19:27.388 --> 07:19:27.398 align:start position:0%
multi-year study in Colorado in
 
07:19:28.868 --> 07:19:28.878 align:start position:0%
Washington which found that it actually
 
07:19:32.628 --> 07:19:32.638 align:start position:0%
improved crime clearance rates um
 
07:19:34.070 --> 07:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
multiple studies again have found that
 
07:19:35.868 --> 07:19:35.878 align:start position:0%
marijuana legalization had little or no
 
07:19:37.910 --> 07:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
effect on traffic accidents and
 
07:19:39.750 --> 07:19:39.760 align:start position:0%
fatalities and then there's also
 
07:19:41.350 --> 07:19:41.360 align:start position:0%
substantial evidence that marijuana
 
07:19:43.628 --> 07:19:43.638 align:start position:0%
legalization assists with reducing the
 
07:19:45.948 --> 07:19:45.958 align:start position:0%
opioid epidemic that is so serious here
 
07:19:48.150 --> 07:19:48.160 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire so again I think it's
 
07:19:49.628 --> 07:19:49.638 align:start position:0%
important to look at you know what we
 
07:19:52.270 --> 07:19:52.280 align:start position:0%
heard in the r versus the reality and
 
07:19:54.230 --> 07:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
again um what we also heard not in
 
07:19:55.868 --> 07:19:55.878 align:start position:0%
testimony today but from the chief when
 
07:19:57.910 --> 07:19:57.920 align:start position:0%
it was heard in criminal justice was
 
07:20:00.310 --> 07:20:00.320 align:start position:0%
there'd be a spillover effecting
 
07:20:02.750 --> 07:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
crime and I just want to point out so
 
07:20:04.350 --> 07:20:04.360 align:start position:0%
going from the most recent State
 
07:20:06.110 --> 07:20:06.120 align:start position:0%
regional state to legalize which was
 
07:20:09.070 --> 07:20:09.080 align:start position:0%
Vermont in 2018 Massachusetts and new H
 
07:20:12.030 --> 07:20:12.040 align:start position:0%
and Maine were before that Mr chair
 
07:20:12.990 --> 07:20:13.000 align:start position:0%
point of
 
07:20:15.548 --> 07:20:15.558 align:start position:0%
order yes we're starting to stray into
 
07:20:17.708 --> 07:20:17.718 align:start position:0%
policy and away from finance and and
 
07:20:19.388 --> 07:20:19.398 align:start position:0%
funds if we could kind of get back on
 
07:20:21.388 --> 07:20:21.398 align:start position:0%
that because everyone's time is valuable
 
07:20:23.070 --> 07:20:23.080 align:start position:0%
oh sorry I was talking about this in the
 
07:20:24.910 --> 07:20:24.920 align:start position:0%
context of the fiscal note assuming that
 
07:20:26.350 --> 07:20:26.360 align:start position:0%
there'd be additional law enforcement
 
07:20:27.750 --> 07:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
costs and I just wanted to give some
 
07:20:30.350 --> 07:20:30.360 align:start position:0%
data around that but I I'm happy to to
 
07:20:32.150 --> 07:20:32.160 align:start position:0%
move on and I think additional and the
 
07:20:35.070 --> 07:20:35.080 align:start position:0%
intangible costs you you had indicated
 
07:20:37.230 --> 07:20:37.240 align:start position:0%
two minutes on you I'm I'm happy to stop
 
07:20:39.230 --> 07:20:39.240 align:start position:0%
there then
 
07:20:42.468 --> 07:20:42.478 align:start position:0%
sir if we can wrap it up sure I think
 
07:20:44.590 --> 07:20:44.600 align:start position:0%
just the intangible costs um you know
 
07:20:46.830 --> 07:20:46.840 align:start position:0%
the cost of marijuana rest if you're on
 
07:20:48.190 --> 07:20:48.200 align:start position:0%
Student Financial Aid you lose your
 
07:20:50.590 --> 07:20:50.600 align:start position:0%
student financial aid it's harder to get
 
07:20:52.750 --> 07:20:52.760 align:start position:0%
it's harder to get employment again
 
07:20:54.430 --> 07:20:54.440 align:start position:0%
those are intangible costs that I think
 
07:20:56.150 --> 07:20:56.160 align:start position:0%
will impact the bottom line I think it's
 
07:20:58.070 --> 07:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
important for this legislation to move
 
07:21:06.270 --> 07:21:06.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:21:06.280 --> 07:21:07.868 align:start position:0%
 
time

07:21:07.868 --> 07:21:07.878 align:start position:0%
time
 
07:21:11.670 --> 07:21:11.680 align:start position:0%
okay all right rather
 
07:21:15.310 --> 07:21:15.320 align:start position:0%
than not hear from
 
07:21:19.430 --> 07:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
everybody we have one two three four
 
07:21:22.230 --> 07:21:22.240 align:start position:0%
more car five more
 
07:21:25.230 --> 07:21:25.240 align:start position:0%
cards we can limit it to three
 
07:21:29.788 --> 07:21:29.798 align:start position:0%
minutes maximum for questions and
 
07:21:35.190 --> 07:21:35.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:21:38.830 --> 07:21:38.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity so
 
07:21:40.948 --> 07:21:40.958 align:start position:0%

abami and committee members my name is
 
07:22:14.070 --> 07:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
Keenan Blum and I serve as the president
 
07:22:15.830 --> 07:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
and CEO of prime alternative treatment
 
07:22:18.190 --> 07:22:18.200 align:start position:0%
centers of New Hampshire established in
 
07:22:20.468 --> 07:22:20.478 align:start position:0%
2016 Prime is one of the not for profit
 
07:22:22.230 --> 07:22:22.240 align:start position:0%
alternative treatment centers that is
 
07:22:23.990 --> 07:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
licensed to provide therapeutic cannabis
 
07:22:25.990 --> 07:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
to registered patients in accordance
 
07:22:27.350 --> 07:22:27.360 align:start position:0%
with RSA
 
07:22:30.310 --> 07:22:30.320 align:start position:0%
126x we have approximately 55 staff
 
07:22:32.110 --> 07:22:32.120 align:start position:0%
members and we operate a production
 
07:22:33.230 --> 07:22:33.240 align:start position:0%
facility in Peterborough and
 
07:22:35.150 --> 07:22:35.160 align:start position:0%
dispensaries in marac and
 
07:22:38.910 --> 07:22:38.920 align:start position:0%
chiester our ATC has had only one focus
 
07:22:40.708 --> 07:22:40.718 align:start position:0%
and that is serving registered patients
 
07:22:43.070 --> 07:22:43.080 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire generally we
 
07:22:44.910 --> 07:22:44.920 align:start position:0%
support legalizing cannabis for adults
 
07:22:46.948 --> 07:22:46.958 align:start position:0%
21 and over and we believe adult use
 
07:22:48.548 --> 07:22:48.558 align:start position:0%
cannabis Market should be responsibly
 
07:22:51.030 --> 07:22:51.040 align:start position:0%
regulated following best practices and
 
07:22:53.070 --> 07:22:53.080 align:start position:0%
lessons learned from other states
 
07:22:56.190 --> 07:22:56.200 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we cannot support HB 1598
 
07:22:58.308 --> 07:22:58.318 align:start position:0%
in its current form because it ignores
 
07:22:59.990 --> 07:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
key recommendations from New Hampshire's
 
07:23:01.788 --> 07:23:01.798 align:start position:0%
bipartisan study commission that we
 
07:23:04.388 --> 07:23:04.398 align:start position:0%
believe are essential to success to a
 
07:23:06.788 --> 07:23:06.798 align:start position:0%
successful cannabis regulation
 
07:23:09.030 --> 07:23:09.040 align:start position:0%
policy we have a number of questions and
 
07:23:11.030 --> 07:23:11.040 align:start position:0%
concerns about the bill today I will
 
07:23:12.750 --> 07:23:12.760 align:start position:0%
refrain from commenting on certain areas
 
07:23:14.910 --> 07:23:14.920 align:start position:0%
of policy such as the emission of Home
 
07:23:16.468 --> 07:23:16.478 align:start position:0%
cultivation and the proposed Rec
 
07:23:18.548 --> 07:23:18.558 align:start position:0%
criminalization of infused products
 
07:23:20.070 --> 07:23:20.080 align:start position:0%
because I understand that such issues
 
07:23:21.510 --> 07:23:21.520 align:start position:0%
will likely be considered outside the
 
07:23:23.948 --> 07:23:23.958 align:start position:0%
scope of today's hearing instead I will
 
07:23:25.468 --> 07:23:25.478 align:start position:0%
focus my testimony on issues that are
 
07:23:27.350 --> 07:23:27.360 align:start position:0%
directly relevant to the Bill's fiscal
 
07:23:30.430 --> 07:23:30.440 align:start position:0%
impacts first restricting sales to 10
 
07:23:32.468 --> 07:23:32.478 align:start position:0%
state-run stores rather than allowing
 
07:23:34.510 --> 07:23:34.520 align:start position:0%
Private Sales would limit consumers
 
07:23:36.868 --> 07:23:36.878 align:start position:0%
access negatively impacting potential
 
07:23:39.670 --> 07:23:39.680 align:start position:0%
sales and revenues in Most states that
 
07:23:41.590 --> 07:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
have legalized adult use cannabis
 
07:23:43.308 --> 07:23:43.318 align:start position:0%
medical cannabis businesses have been
 
07:23:45.510 --> 07:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
instrumental in helping to Pioneer Adult
 
07:23:48.990 --> 07:23:49.000 align:start position:0%
use markets may I interrupt you since
 
07:23:51.510 --> 07:23:51.520 align:start position:0%
you have three minutes can you summarize
 
07:23:55.070 --> 07:23:55.080 align:start position:0%
because we can all take this and read it
 
07:23:58.270 --> 07:23:58.280 align:start position:0%
later I will do my very best to thank
 
07:23:58.280 --> 07:24:00.750 align:start position:0%
later I will do my very best to thank
you

07:24:00.750 --> 07:24:00.760 align:start position:0%
you
 
07:24:04.468 --> 07:24:04.478 align:start position:0%
um in this regard hb1 1598 represents a
 
07:24:06.948 --> 07:24:06.958 align:start position:0%
dramatic departure from policies that
 
07:24:08.548 --> 07:24:08.558 align:start position:0%
are generally worked well well in other
 
07:24:10.388 --> 07:24:10.398 align:start position:0%
states when the New Hampshire bar
 
07:24:12.150 --> 07:24:12.160 align:start position:0%
partisan study looked into this they
 
07:24:14.628 --> 07:24:14.638 align:start position:0%
spent significant time and effort
 
07:24:16.070 --> 07:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
evaluating all of these different
 
07:24:18.590 --> 07:24:18.600 align:start position:0%
policies including visiting the atcs at
 
07:24:20.388 --> 07:24:20.398 align:start position:0%
least ours and speaking with with us for
 
07:24:25.230 --> 07:24:25.240 align:start position:0%
hours and asking questions thank you
 
07:24:27.910 --> 07:24:27.920 align:start position:0%
um what they came up with is that any
 
07:24:29.750 --> 07:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
future legislation to legalize and
 
07:24:31.308 --> 07:24:31.318 align:start position:0%
commercialize marijuana should consider
 
07:24:33.510 --> 07:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
a pathway for the atc's licensed and
 
07:24:35.750 --> 07:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis to transition from
 
07:24:37.628 --> 07:24:37.638 align:start position:0%
not for-profit charitable trust to
 
07:24:39.910 --> 07:24:39.920 align:start position:0%
for-profit entities and participa in the
 
07:24:43.270 --> 07:24:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:24:45.548 --> 07:24:45.558 align:start position:0%
Market our staff has been assisting
 
07:24:48.308 --> 07:24:48.318 align:start position:0%
patients for over 5 years we have
 
07:24:50.910 --> 07:24:50.920 align:start position:0%
developed great skill at this and we put
 
07:24:52.708 --> 07:24:52.718 align:start position:0%
every bit of our effort into it we would
 
07:24:54.308 --> 07:24:54.318 align:start position:0%
like to be able to participate in this
 
07:24:55.868 --> 07:24:55.878 align:start position:0%
market and to take these skills and
 
07:24:57.868 --> 07:24:57.878 align:start position:0%
things we've learned and try to assist
 
07:25:00.110 --> 07:25:00.120 align:start position:0%
to make the adult use cannabis Market in
 
07:25:01.430 --> 07:25:01.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire something that works
 
07:25:03.548 --> 07:25:03.558 align:start position:0%
really well and is beneficial for the
 
07:25:06.590 --> 07:25:06.600 align:start position:0%
people of New Hampshire both from a for
 
07:25:10.388 --> 07:25:10.398 align:start position:0%
their private use and from a budgetary
 
07:25:13.990 --> 07:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
perspective um our my second point was
 
07:25:16.910 --> 07:25:16.920 align:start position:0%
just that HB 598 would produce Revenue
 
07:25:18.590 --> 07:25:18.600 align:start position:0%
but at what cost to patients and the
 
07:25:21.628 --> 07:25:21.638 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program
 
07:25:25.070 --> 07:25:25.080 align:start position:0%
um in general as others have pointed out
 
07:25:27.308 --> 07:25:27.318 align:start position:0%
taxes are the difference between a
 
07:25:29.468 --> 07:25:29.478 align:start position:0%
medical or therapeutic program and adult
 
07:25:31.830 --> 07:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
use adult use is generally taxed very
 
07:25:34.150 --> 07:25:34.160 align:start position:0%
high the therapeutic cannabis program
 
07:25:35.830 --> 07:25:35.840 align:start position:0%
and or medical program is not taxed
 
07:25:37.670 --> 07:25:37.680 align:start position:0%
usually at
 
07:25:37.680 --> 07:25:39.670 align:start position:0%
usually at
all

07:25:39.670 --> 07:25:39.680 align:start position:0%
all
 
07:25:42.308 --> 07:25:42.318 align:start position:0%
um as a nonprofit our ATC does not
 
07:25:43.948 --> 07:25:43.958 align:start position:0%
currently produce revenue for the state
 
07:25:46.548 --> 07:25:46.558 align:start position:0%
except for paying for the program we are
 
07:25:48.350 --> 07:25:48.360 align:start position:0%
EXA from the business Enterprise tax and
 
07:25:49.990 --> 07:25:50.000 align:start position:0%
business profits tax and there are no
 
07:25:51.868 --> 07:25:51.878 align:start position:0%
State Taxi Le taxes Lev in the
 
07:25:53.750 --> 07:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
production and sale of therapeutic
 
07:25:55.868 --> 07:25:55.878 align:start position:0%
cannabis we do pay a lot of federal
 
07:25:57.388 --> 07:25:57.398 align:start position:0%
taxes and we would like to begin paying
 
07:25:59.430 --> 07:25:59.440 align:start position:0%
state taxes as well but only we can only
 
07:26:01.110 --> 07:26:01.120 align:start position:0%
do so if the legislature allows us to
 
07:26:03.110 --> 07:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
reorganize and begin serving the adult
 
07:26:03.120 --> 07:26:03.910 align:start position:0%
reorganize and begin serving the adult
use

07:26:03.910 --> 07:26:03.920 align:start position:0%
use
 
07:26:06.270 --> 07:26:06.280 align:start position:0%
market so finally although we feel we
 
07:26:07.708 --> 07:26:07.718 align:start position:0%
have no choice but to oppose the bill as
 
07:26:09.150 --> 07:26:09.160 align:start position:0%
currently written we would be more than
 
07:26:11.150 --> 07:26:11.160 align:start position:0%
happy to review any proposed amendments
 
07:26:13.430 --> 07:26:13.440 align:start position:0%
and reconsider our position accordingly
 
07:26:15.110 --> 07:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
we agree with the overwhelming majority
 
07:26:16.468 --> 07:26:16.478 align:start position:0%
of granted Staters that cannabis should
 
07:26:18.388 --> 07:26:18.398 align:start position:0%
be legal and we would like to work with
 
07:26:20.430 --> 07:26:20.440 align:start position:0%
you and other policy makers contributing
 
07:26:21.708 --> 07:26:21.718 align:start position:0%
the knowledge and experience we've
 
07:26:23.388 --> 07:26:23.398 align:start position:0%
gained in the last five and a half years
 
07:26:26.030 --> 07:26:26.040 align:start position:0%
of this process so on behalf of our
 
07:26:27.590 --> 07:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
staff managers and and directors at
 
07:26:29.430 --> 07:26:29.440 align:start position:0%
primeatc we thank you for your time and
 
07:26:31.788 --> 07:26:31.798 align:start position:0%
consideration and um if there's any way
 
07:26:33.628 --> 07:26:33.638 align:start position:0%
we can assist please uh don't thank you
 
07:26:36.948 --> 07:26:36.958 align:start position:0%
for summarizing questions let me just so
 
07:26:39.468 --> 07:26:39.478 align:start position:0%
what you're saying is and I yes correct
 
07:26:41.388 --> 07:26:41.398 align:start position:0%
we that's was in the in the commission
 
07:26:43.948 --> 07:26:43.958 align:start position:0%
report that if we were to legalized and
 
07:26:45.190 --> 07:26:45.200 align:start position:0%
when we talked legalized and
 
07:26:46.708 --> 07:26:46.718 align:start position:0%
commercialized we talked about free
 
07:26:48.150 --> 07:26:48.160 align:start position:0%
enterprise we weren't talking about this
 
07:26:51.510 --> 07:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
model and we gave you pathway we suggest
 
07:26:53.868 --> 07:26:53.878 align:start position:0%
that there be a pathway for the the
 
07:26:57.830 --> 07:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
atc's to also participate and divide
 
07:27:00.910 --> 07:27:00.920 align:start position:0%
their stores medical and and uh to be
 
07:27:02.270 --> 07:27:02.280 align:start position:0%
able to
 
07:27:04.868 --> 07:27:04.878 align:start position:0%
compete in in the market but with this
 
07:27:06.830 --> 07:27:06.840 align:start position:0%
bill there's no possibility to that so
 
07:27:08.948 --> 07:27:08.958 align:start position:0%
the the atcs are standing out there all
 
07:27:11.468 --> 07:27:11.478 align:start position:0%
by themselves and at the mercy of
 
07:27:13.670 --> 07:27:13.680 align:start position:0%
whatever happens in the market uh is
 
07:27:16.190 --> 07:27:16.200 align:start position:0%
that correct and is that's what you're
 
07:27:17.670 --> 07:27:17.680 align:start position:0%
trying to say correct well yes and we
 
07:27:19.468 --> 07:27:19.478 align:start position:0%
have a very small medical program in New
 
07:27:21.670 --> 07:27:21.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire with less than or about 1% of
 
07:27:24.190 --> 07:27:24.200 align:start position:0%
the population whereas many states been
 
07:27:26.468 --> 07:27:26.478 align:start position:0%
as much as 5% like Massachusetts was
 
07:27:28.750 --> 07:27:28.760 align:start position:0%
until recently generally you will see a
 
07:27:31.030 --> 07:27:31.040 align:start position:0%
reduction in that program and we are not
 
07:27:33.070 --> 07:27:33.080 align:start position:0%
in a place where the margins available
 
07:27:35.430 --> 07:27:35.440 align:start position:0%
or the amount or or our business can
 
07:27:38.350 --> 07:27:38.360 align:start position:0%
take say our our uh our sales being cut
 
07:27:40.750 --> 07:27:40.760 align:start position:0%
in half and still survive that is not
 
07:27:41.830 --> 07:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
something that we would be able to
 
07:27:43.868 --> 07:27:43.878 align:start position:0%
manage so you would see likely a death
 
07:27:45.948 --> 07:27:45.958 align:start position:0%
of that program and a number of
 
07:27:47.750 --> 07:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
different a number of patients say
 
07:27:50.350 --> 07:27:50.360 align:start position:0%
patients under 21 or may not who may not
 
07:27:52.990 --> 07:27:53.000 align:start position:0%
find the appropriate products or more so
 
07:27:55.350 --> 07:27:55.360 align:start position:0%
guidance and education in the model
 
07:27:57.670 --> 07:27:57.680 align:start position:0%
proposed here they would be completely
 
07:27:59.510 --> 07:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
without help or without Assistance or
 
07:28:01.030 --> 07:28:01.040 align:start position:0%
the appropriate
 
07:28:04.270 --> 07:28:04.280 align:start position:0%
products any further questions say none
 
07:28:08.990 --> 07:28:09.000 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you the next is a darl e
 
07:28:14.670 --> 07:28:14.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:28:18.110 --> 07:28:18.120 align:start position:0%
r uh representing New Hampshire cannabis
 
07:28:20.670 --> 07:28:20.680 align:start position:0%
Association and support part of the bill
 
07:28:23.270 --> 07:28:23.280 align:start position:0%
and if you could just be I will be
 
07:28:24.510 --> 07:28:24.520 align:start position:0%
definitely brief I know it's getting
 
07:28:26.350 --> 07:28:26.360 align:start position:0%
long in the teeth here uh essentially
 
07:28:28.868 --> 07:28:28.878 align:start position:0%
I'm here today just to uh talk about
 
07:28:31.708 --> 07:28:31.718 align:start position:0%
essential services in U respect to the
 
07:28:32.910 --> 07:28:32.920 align:start position:0%
fact that if we want revenue for the
 
07:28:34.270 --> 07:28:34.280 align:start position:0%
state we've got to make sure cannabis
 
07:28:36.910 --> 07:28:36.920 align:start position:0%
businesses can do business um I want you
 
07:28:41.070 --> 07:28:41.080 align:start position:0%
to know I reached out to the CEO of a
 
07:28:42.510 --> 07:28:42.520 align:start position:0%
credit union she lives here in New
 
07:28:45.670 --> 07:28:45.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um she is the CEO of a cred of
 
07:28:47.388 --> 07:28:47.398 align:start position:0%
a wholly owned subsidiary of the credit
 
07:28:50.628 --> 07:28:50.638 align:start position:0%
union that does Bank can abis I have
 
07:28:53.150 --> 07:28:53.160 align:start position:0%
some information from her uh she has
 
07:28:55.150 --> 07:28:55.160 align:start position:0%
told me she can Bank New Hampshire
 
07:28:57.788 --> 07:28:57.798 align:start position:0%
cannabis businesses she can Bank retail
 
07:29:00.590 --> 07:29:00.600 align:start position:0%
stores even if they are state run um but
 
07:29:02.788 --> 07:29:02.798 align:start position:0%
only if the language of the bill does
 
07:29:06.708 --> 07:29:06.718 align:start position:0%
not require FDIC insured institutions
 
07:29:09.430 --> 07:29:09.440 align:start position:0%
because as she told me the credit unions
 
07:29:12.750 --> 07:29:12.760 align:start position:0%
oper operate under a different FDIC
 
07:29:15.430 --> 07:29:15.440 align:start position:0%
insured Federal equivalent so that was
 
07:29:17.430 --> 07:29:17.440 align:start position:0%
something important for her to note that
 
07:29:18.830 --> 07:29:18.840 align:start position:0%
as long as you don't limit it they can
 
07:29:20.628 --> 07:29:20.638 align:start position:0%
Bank us uh they have locations in
 
07:29:23.190 --> 07:29:23.200 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and New Hampshire and also
 
07:29:25.628 --> 07:29:25.638 align:start position:0%
employees could use those branches uh
 
07:29:27.468 --> 07:29:27.478 align:start position:0%
I've got her contact information here
 
07:29:29.830 --> 07:29:29.840 align:start position:0%
along with a couple of handouts uh that
 
07:29:32.350 --> 07:29:32.360 align:start position:0%
I will email to the committee uh so that
 
07:29:34.270 --> 07:29:34.280 align:start position:0%
you can talk to her if you have any
 
07:29:36.270 --> 07:29:36.280 align:start position:0%
questions uh I also wanted to just
 
07:29:38.788 --> 07:29:38.798 align:start position:0%
brooch the pro the uh the area of
 
07:29:40.708 --> 07:29:40.718 align:start position:0%
financing many of you may not know but
 
07:29:42.030 --> 07:29:42.040 align:start position:0%
this is what I do as a day job
 
07:29:43.910 --> 07:29:43.920 align:start position:0%
connecting cannabis companies with
 
07:29:47.150 --> 07:29:47.160 align:start position:0%
sources of capital um it is available
 
07:29:49.510 --> 07:29:49.520 align:start position:0%

Equity investment firms so I want to
 
07:30:03.388 --> 07:30:03.398 align:start position:0%
make sure that was clear uh in terms of
 
07:30:05.110 --> 07:30:05.120 align:start position:0%
credit card and merchant processing
 
07:30:07.708 --> 07:30:07.718 align:start position:0%
right now they direct touching uh
 
07:30:09.910 --> 07:30:09.920 align:start position:0%
cannabis companies cannot use the credit
 
07:30:12.708 --> 07:30:12.718 align:start position:0%
card rails to process transactions they
 
07:30:15.190 --> 07:30:15.200 align:start position:0%
can use pin debit they can use cashless
 
07:30:17.548 --> 07:30:17.558 align:start position:0%
ATM although that might be going away
 
07:30:19.468 --> 07:30:19.478 align:start position:0%
and there are some workarounds that do
 
07:30:20.868 --> 07:30:20.878 align:start position:0%
involve credit cards that are coming to
 
07:30:22.548 --> 07:30:22.558 align:start position:0%
the Forefront including a company in
 
07:30:25.030 --> 07:30:25.040 align:start position:0%
California that has um brought their
 
07:30:26.990 --> 07:30:27.000 align:start position:0%
solution to the state that is both Fally
 
07:30:29.350 --> 07:30:29.360 align:start position:0%
and state compliant um I'll give you
 
07:30:30.788 --> 07:30:30.798 align:start position:0%
some information on that I also did
 
07:30:33.030 --> 07:30:33.040 align:start position:0%
reach out to a patent and trademark
 
07:30:35.468 --> 07:30:35.478 align:start position:0%
lawyer um you know can New Hampshire
 
07:30:37.548 --> 07:30:37.558 align:start position:0%
cannabis companies protect their brands
 
07:30:39.868 --> 07:30:39.878 align:start position:0%
and any strains that they create the an
 
07:30:42.548 --> 07:30:42.558 align:start position:0%
short answer is yes in two ways both the
 
07:30:44.430 --> 07:30:44.440 align:start position:0%
name of a strain or the business and
 
07:30:46.868 --> 07:30:46.878 align:start position:0%
also the genetics of a strain uh Matthew
 
07:30:49.628 --> 07:30:49.638 align:start position:0%
Miller from mg Miller has also okay me
 
07:30:51.110 --> 07:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
giving you his information if you'd like
 
07:30:53.510 --> 07:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
to reach out to talk to him about that
 
07:30:55.110 --> 07:30:55.120 align:start position:0%
and then I would just also include the
 
07:30:56.308 --> 07:30:56.318 align:start position:0%
fact that we have people that can
 
07:30:59.150 --> 07:30:59.160 align:start position:0%
provide insurances for the businesses um
 
07:31:00.670 --> 07:31:00.680 align:start position:0%
just about any essential service that
 
07:31:02.150 --> 07:31:02.160 align:start position:0%
they're going to need to operate already
 
07:31:04.948 --> 07:31:04.958 align:start position:0%
exist and so some of the challenges that
 
07:31:06.510 --> 07:31:06.520 align:start position:0%
I think that we're looking at in some of
 
07:31:09.230 --> 07:31:09.240 align:start position:0%
these bills U might already be solved
 
07:31:11.110 --> 07:31:11.120 align:start position:0%
and so we wanted you to know that and so
 
07:31:12.910 --> 07:31:12.920 align:start position:0%
I will send all of these out uh in an
 
07:31:14.788 --> 07:31:14.798 align:start position:0%
email to the committee and I also put my
 
07:31:16.350 --> 07:31:16.360 align:start position:0%
business card over here if any of you
 
07:31:17.910 --> 07:31:17.920 align:start position:0%

07:31:19.510 --> 07:31:19.520 align:start position:0%
you in touch with the professionals okay
 
07:31:21.788 --> 07:31:21.798 align:start position:0%
okay we would appreciate the information
 
07:31:24.548 --> 07:31:24.558 align:start position:0%
thank you for being
 
07:31:27.990 --> 07:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
brief the next is Mark Hall from the

Department of
 
07:31:34.750 --> 07:31:34.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:31:37.948 --> 07:31:37.958 align:start position:0%
bill good afternoon Mr chairman I
 
07:31:41.548 --> 07:31:41.558 align:start position:0%
promise you I'll be brief um I realize
 
07:31:44.430 --> 07:31:44.440 align:start position:0%
your time is valuable um my name is Mark
 
07:31:46.110 --> 07:31:46.120 align:start position:0%
Hall I'm a field area Captain with the
 
07:31:48.070 --> 07:31:48.080 align:start position:0%
state police I'm here on behalf of the
 
07:31:50.150 --> 07:31:50.160 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety in opposition of
 
07:31:53.150 --> 07:31:53.160 align:start position:0%
the bill and although I have many points
 
07:31:55.190 --> 07:31:55.200 align:start position:0%
that have some of them have already been
 
07:31:58.590 --> 07:31:58.600 align:start position:0%
addressed I'll just stick to
 
07:32:01.590 --> 07:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
um what what could be the fiscal uh side
 
07:32:03.468 --> 07:32:03.478 align:start position:0%
of things as far as a law enforcement
 
07:32:07.910 --> 07:32:07.920 align:start position:0%
impact um with the legalization uh this
 
07:32:09.628 --> 07:32:09.638 align:start position:0%
this definitely would have a significant
 
07:32:11.830 --> 07:32:11.840 align:start position:0%
impact on on law enforcement in
 
07:32:13.350 --> 07:32:13.360 align:start position:0%
particular I know it's already been
 
07:32:15.548 --> 07:32:15.558 align:start position:0%
addressed with increase in impaired
 
07:32:18.350 --> 07:32:18.360 align:start position:0%
driving introducing uh what's now a
 
07:32:20.670 --> 07:32:20.680 align:start position:0%
controlled drug into to into our society
 
07:32:23.548 --> 07:32:23.558 align:start position:0%
would would uh certainly uh that's the
 
07:32:25.868 --> 07:32:25.878 align:start position:0%
potential uh result is increased in
 
07:32:28.830 --> 07:32:28.840 align:start position:0%
impaired drivers increased in uh traffic
 
07:32:32.708 --> 07:32:32.718 align:start position:0%
crashes and fatalities uh due to um
 
07:32:35.510 --> 07:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
driving Under the Influence um certainly
 
07:32:37.308 --> 07:32:37.318 align:start position:0%
we would be looking to increase the
 
07:32:39.308 --> 07:32:39.318 align:start position:0%
number of drug recognition experts that
 
07:32:44.430 --> 07:32:44.440 align:start position:0%
are in the field um to uh combat this uh
 
07:32:47.868 --> 07:32:47.878 align:start position:0%
issue um and also an increase in
 
07:32:50.350 --> 07:32:50.360 align:start position:0%
training in in Manpower
 
07:32:53.308 --> 07:32:53.318 align:start position:0%
um to deal with any investigations that
 
07:32:56.308 --> 07:32:56.318 align:start position:0%
might come with this uh
 
07:32:58.388 --> 07:32:58.398 align:start position:0%
legalization I'm open to any questions
 
07:32:59.510 --> 07:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
if you have
 
07:33:01.868 --> 07:33:01.878 align:start position:0%
them thank you for your testimony
 
07:33:03.510 --> 07:33:03.520 align:start position:0%
questions from the

committee see none thank you thank you

Stockwell

07:33:13.788 --> 07:33:13.798 align:start position:0%
Stockwell
 
07:33:16.030 --> 07:33:16.040 align:start position:0%
stwall uh
 
07:33:18.150 --> 07:33:18.160 align:start position:0%
constituent oppose the
 
07:33:18.160 --> 07:33:21.590 align:start position:0%
constituent oppose the
bill

07:33:21.590 --> 07:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:33:25.230 --> 07:33:25.240 align:start position:0%
I'm from New Hampshire um I've been uh
 
07:33:29.150 --> 07:33:29.160 align:start position:0%
and um I just first of all just want to
 
07:33:32.468 --> 07:33:32.478 align:start position:0%
point out um that in New Hampshire this
 
07:33:36.868 --> 07:33:36.878 align:start position:0%
year there there have been um according
 
07:33:38.670 --> 07:33:38.680 align:start position:0%
to the USDA
 
07:33:43.510 --> 07:33:43.520 align:start position:0%
33 Growers of of uh hemp producers in
 
07:33:46.030 --> 07:33:46.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um and that's a
 
07:33:48.510 --> 07:33:48.520 align:start position:0%
combination of commercial and personal
 
07:33:48.520 --> 07:33:49.750 align:start position:0%
combination of commercial and personal
Growers

07:33:49.750 --> 07:33:49.760 align:start position:0%
Growers
 
07:33:51.628 --> 07:33:51.638 align:start position:0%
all licensed to grow
 
07:33:55.590 --> 07:33:55.600 align:start position:0%
outdoors um and uh some under Greenhouse
 
07:33:57.750 --> 07:33:57.760 align:start position:0%
some outdoors and this has been
 
07:34:01.350 --> 07:34:01.360 align:start position:0%
happening all over New Hampshire over
 
07:34:06.788 --> 07:34:06.798 align:start position:0%
the past year um and uh these plants are
 
07:34:12.350 --> 07:34:12.360 align:start position:0%
visually and and and uh smell wise
 
07:34:16.990 --> 07:34:17.000 align:start position:0%
identical to um flowering marijuana
 
07:34:19.388 --> 07:34:19.398 align:start position:0%
plants cuz they're grown for the CBD FL
 
07:34:22.628 --> 07:34:22.638 align:start position:0%
flow um and uh as far as I know that
 
07:34:25.548 --> 07:34:25.558 align:start position:0%
hasn't caused any major disruptions in
 
07:34:27.510 --> 07:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
the state um to have these plants
 
07:34:30.910 --> 07:34:30.920 align:start position:0%
growing all over the state um and my
 
07:34:35.868 --> 07:34:35.878 align:start position:0%
point is um mainly the cost of um
 
07:34:40.750 --> 07:34:40.760 align:start position:0%
prohibition is is a Taps us
 
07:34:43.030 --> 07:34:43.040 align:start position:0%
resource-wise and uh all the states
 
07:34:44.990 --> 07:34:45.000 align:start position:0%
around us
 
07:34:47.708 --> 07:34:47.718 align:start position:0%
um their their
 
07:34:49.708 --> 07:34:49.718 align:start position:0%
legalizations um
 
07:34:53.150 --> 07:34:53.160 align:start position:0%
the what they did number one right out
 
07:34:55.910 --> 07:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
of the gate was legalized possession and
 
07:34:57.350 --> 07:34:57.360 align:start position:0%
growing of the
 
07:35:00.910 --> 07:35:00.920 align:start position:0%
plant and um and as far as I can tell I
 
07:35:03.548 --> 07:35:03.558 align:start position:0%
mean we've heard um these statistics
 
07:35:06.628 --> 07:35:06.638 align:start position:0%
from law enforcement that are
 
07:35:11.788 --> 07:35:11.798 align:start position:0%
um quite honestly um smoke and mirrors
 
07:35:13.628 --> 07:35:13.638 align:start position:0%
the the sky hasn't fallen in any of
 
07:35:17.910 --> 07:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
these states around us and um and the
 
07:35:22.150 --> 07:35:22.160 align:start position:0%
the um enforcement of the prohibition is
 
07:35:26.388 --> 07:35:26.398 align:start position:0%
Major costly and and I would submit that
 
07:35:28.510 --> 07:35:28.520 align:start position:0%
um putting forward any
 
07:35:32.510 --> 07:35:32.520 align:start position:0%
legalization program that doesn't um
 
07:35:35.430 --> 07:35:35.440 align:start position:0%
legalize or at least decriminalize the
 
07:35:38.190 --> 07:35:38.200 align:start position:0%
growing of the plant for personal use is
 
07:35:41.628 --> 07:35:41.638 align:start position:0%
a major mistake because you're going to
 
07:35:41.638 --> 07:35:43.270 align:start position:0%
a major mistake because you're going to
be

07:35:43.270 --> 07:35:43.280 align:start position:0%
be
 
07:35:49.110 --> 07:35:49.120 align:start position:0%
um um making it status quo to have um
 
07:35:51.270 --> 07:35:51.280 align:start position:0%
people have
 
07:35:53.830 --> 07:35:53.840 align:start position:0%
uh uh
 
07:35:53.840 --> 07:35:55.788 align:start position:0%
uh uh
marijuana

07:35:55.788 --> 07:35:55.798 align:start position:0%
marijuana
 
07:35:59.628 --> 07:35:59.638 align:start position:0%
and and that's just going to
 
07:36:03.788 --> 07:36:03.798 align:start position:0%
there's there was 33 Growers of these
 
07:36:05.750 --> 07:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
marijuana Lake plants and then there's
 
07:36:07.190 --> 07:36:07.200 align:start position:0%
going to be there's going to be more
 
07:36:10.430 --> 07:36:10.440 align:start position:0%
next year USDA licensed and the New
 
07:36:13.948 --> 07:36:13.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's as far as I know not connect
 
07:36:17.388 --> 07:36:17.398 align:start position:0%
collecting any revenue from those um and
 
07:36:21.230 --> 07:36:21.240 align:start position:0%
so they lost big time Big Time there but
 
07:36:26.510 --> 07:36:26.520 align:start position:0%
the but uh personal growing is is a um
 
07:36:29.708 --> 07:36:29.718 align:start position:0%
is a business sector in itself for for
 
07:36:31.070 --> 07:36:31.080 align:start position:0%
supplies and
 
07:36:33.670 --> 07:36:33.680 align:start position:0%
consultation and uh and it's also
 
07:36:36.308 --> 07:36:36.318 align:start position:0%
keeping a lot of Revenue State side
 
07:36:38.350 --> 07:36:38.360 align:start position:0%
because that's number of New Hampshire
 
07:36:40.468 --> 07:36:40.478 align:start position:0%
people that aren't going outside in New
 
07:36:42.670 --> 07:36:42.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um the other thing that I just
 
07:36:45.150 --> 07:36:45.160 align:start position:0%
want point that I wanted to make was is
 
07:36:48.590 --> 07:36:48.600 align:start position:0%
I attended many of the meetings on the
 
07:36:51.190 --> 07:36:51.200 align:start position:0%
uh legalization Committee in
 
07:36:56.270 --> 07:36:56.280 align:start position:0%
2018 and there there was um you know the
 
07:36:58.308 --> 07:36:58.318 align:start position:0%
determination that it would be ill
 
07:37:00.750 --> 07:37:00.760 align:start position:0%
advised and inappropriate for the Liquor
 
07:37:05.708 --> 07:37:05.718 align:start position:0%
Commission to to um be a regulatory body
 
07:37:08.350 --> 07:37:08.360 align:start position:0%
and have any hand in in uh cannabis
 
07:37:12.548 --> 07:37:12.558 align:start position:0%
control um and I think that that was on
 
07:37:16.070 --> 07:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
Target and and uh a lot of work went on
 
07:37:17.708 --> 07:37:17.718 align:start position:0%
into that committee and I think that
 
07:37:19.910 --> 07:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
that should uh a lot of those the
 
07:37:22.030 --> 07:37:22.040 align:start position:0%
advisements from that committee should
 
07:37:24.868 --> 07:37:24.878 align:start position:0%
be double checked before we go forward
 
07:37:26.468 --> 07:37:26.478 align:start position:0%
with any
 
07:37:29.430 --> 07:37:29.440 align:start position:0%
legalizations thank you for your

opposition but he's a public member of
 
07:37:52.308 --> 07:37:52.318 align:start position:0%
 
07:37:54.510 --> 07:37:54.520 align:start position:0%

2018 thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
07:38:02.150 --> 07:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
members of the committee um thank you
 
07:38:04.230 --> 07:38:04.240 align:start position:0%
for being here at this weary hour and
 
07:38:07.548 --> 07:38:07.558 align:start position:0%
for being so patient um I I do support
 
07:38:08.910 --> 07:38:08.920 align:start position:0%
legalization so I don't want to discuss
 
07:38:10.868 --> 07:38:10.878 align:start position:0%
the policy issues of it but I do have
 
07:38:12.670 --> 07:38:12.680 align:start position:0%
some issues and questions that I think
 
07:38:14.708 --> 07:38:14.718 align:start position:0%
uh might you might want to consider when
 
07:38:15.990 --> 07:38:16.000 align:start position:0%
considering amendments to how this
 
07:38:18.750 --> 07:38:18.760 align:start position:0%
should be implemented uh like um
 
07:38:20.150 --> 07:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
representative aramy was saying there
 
07:38:21.830 --> 07:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
were uh we had a commission that studied
 
07:38:23.868 --> 07:38:23.878 align:start position:0%
it and we had lots of recommendations I
 
07:38:25.708 --> 07:38:25.718 align:start position:0%
don't think they're being taken into
 
07:38:29.388 --> 07:38:29.398 align:start position:0%
consideration in this particular bill um
 
07:38:30.868 --> 07:38:30.878 align:start position:0%
if you're going to judge whether we're
 
07:38:33.590 --> 07:38:33.600 align:start position:0%
going to have a state Monopoly versus a
 
07:38:35.788 --> 07:38:35.798 align:start position:0%
private sector uh option way of doing
 
07:38:37.990 --> 07:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
this we have to look at not just is this
 
07:38:39.230 --> 07:38:39.240 align:start position:0%
going to make money for New Hampshire if
 
07:38:40.590 --> 07:38:40.600 align:start position:0%
we sell it from the state we have to
 
07:38:43.388 --> 07:38:43.398 align:start position:0%
look at it um from the side of how much
 
07:38:44.590 --> 07:38:44.600 align:start position:0%
money would we make if we sold it from
 
07:38:46.868 --> 07:38:46.878 align:start position:0%
the private sector we're missing we're
 
07:38:48.750 --> 07:38:48.760 align:start position:0%
not paying um enough attention to the
 
07:38:49.910 --> 07:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
fact that we'd be getting business
 
07:38:52.468 --> 07:38:52.478 align:start position:0%
profits tax business Enterprise taxes if
 
07:38:54.868 --> 07:38:54.878 align:start position:0%
there was a uh some kind of model where
 
07:38:56.468 --> 07:38:56.478 align:start position:0%
people were able to go to a bar or some
 
07:38:57.830 --> 07:38:57.840 align:start position:0%
kind of place where they could safely
 
07:38:59.670 --> 07:38:59.680 align:start position:0%
consume it in some way and an edible or
 
07:39:00.830 --> 07:39:00.840 align:start position:0%
food Arrangement there could be meals
 
07:39:02.910 --> 07:39:02.920 align:start position:0%
and rooms taxes applied to it other
 
07:39:05.948 --> 07:39:05.958 align:start position:0%
sources of revenue for the state
 
07:39:10.230 --> 07:39:10.240 align:start position:0%
um we also have to um look at the state
 
07:39:12.468 --> 07:39:12.478 align:start position:0%
pension liability of new employees that
 
07:39:14.070 --> 07:39:14.080 align:start position:0%
the state would have to hire and fund
 
07:39:16.308 --> 07:39:16.318 align:start position:0%
those pensions through however long
 
07:39:19.830 --> 07:39:19.840 align:start position:0%
they'd be getting those pensions um um
 
07:39:21.230 --> 07:39:21.240 align:start position:0%
we have to examine the legal and
 
07:39:25.190 --> 07:39:25.200 align:start position:0%
economic um risks of assuming um the
 
07:39:27.270 --> 07:39:27.280 align:start position:0%
state Monopoly I mean what happens if if
 
07:39:28.670 --> 07:39:28.680 align:start position:0%
Federal Law changes and we're kind of
 
07:39:30.510 --> 07:39:30.520 align:start position:0%
screwed here we're just stuck with this
 
07:39:31.788 --> 07:39:31.798 align:start position:0%
big business that we have to fund and
 
07:39:32.948 --> 07:39:32.958 align:start position:0%
we've got a bank and all this money
 
07:39:34.830 --> 07:39:34.840 align:start position:0%
we're spending and pensions and now we
 
07:39:37.150 --> 07:39:37.160 align:start position:0%
can't do it uh times can change I'm not
 
07:39:40.468 --> 07:39:40.478 align:start position:0%
saying it's likely but it's possible um
 
07:39:42.230 --> 07:39:42.240 align:start position:0%
we heard testimony about the potential
 
07:39:44.308 --> 07:39:44.318 align:start position:0%
impact of becoming of um of harming the
 
07:39:45.990 --> 07:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
medical cannabis
 
07:39:48.270 --> 07:39:48.280 align:start position:0%
economy uh there was a law enforcement
 
07:39:49.990 --> 07:39:50.000 align:start position:0%
officer previously testified about how
 
07:39:52.468 --> 07:39:52.478 align:start position:0%
the illicit Market produces about 250%
 
07:39:53.868 --> 07:39:53.878 align:start position:0%
of what actually needs to be sold in
 
07:39:56.308 --> 07:39:56.318 align:start position:0%
this country so it would not be unheard
 
07:39:58.030 --> 07:39:58.040 align:start position:0%
of for a business that wants to compete
 
07:40:00.270 --> 07:40:00.280 align:start position:0%
a black market for example that wants to
 
07:40:01.868 --> 07:40:01.878 align:start position:0%
compete with us they could flood the
 
07:40:03.990 --> 07:40:04.000 align:start position:0%
market and keep us from selling anything
 
07:40:06.708 --> 07:40:06.718 align:start position:0%
they've got 2 150% more than they
 
07:40:08.628 --> 07:40:08.638 align:start position:0%
actually need in this country so you
 
07:40:10.590 --> 07:40:10.600 align:start position:0%
know I don't know how that would even be
 
07:40:12.388 --> 07:40:12.398 align:start position:0%
uh a viable option the most viable
 
07:40:13.708 --> 07:40:13.718 align:start position:0%
option will be allowing people to grow
 
07:40:17.350 --> 07:40:17.360 align:start position:0%
for personal usage um like the alcohol
 
07:40:18.868 --> 07:40:18.878 align:start position:0%
Uh current situation Hampshire you can
 
07:40:21.670 --> 07:40:21.680 align:start position:0%
have home brew of beer and wine uh that
 
07:40:22.990 --> 07:40:23.000 align:start position:0%
was discussed in the commission it was
 
07:40:24.750 --> 07:40:24.760 align:start position:0%
something that liquor enforcement they
 
07:40:25.788 --> 07:40:25.798 align:start position:0%
although they like to go after
 
07:40:27.750 --> 07:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
Moonshiners and people that are selling
 
07:40:30.110 --> 07:40:30.120 align:start position:0%
it for profit they don't even check on
 
07:40:32.230 --> 07:40:32.240 align:start position:0%
people growing it for for you know
 
07:40:33.990 --> 07:40:34.000 align:start position:0%
personal consumption use under the legal
 
07:40:37.788 --> 07:40:37.798 align:start position:0%
limit there's just it's not a concern um
 
07:40:41.468 --> 07:40:41.478 align:start position:0%
another impact is um the the economic
 
07:40:43.350 --> 07:40:43.360 align:start position:0%
and social impacts that be that will be
 
07:40:45.708 --> 07:40:45.718 align:start position:0%
lost uh for potential business owners
 
07:40:46.910 --> 07:40:46.920 align:start position:0%
employees from economically
 
07:40:48.750 --> 07:40:48.760 align:start position:0%
disadvantaged groups and those who've
 
07:40:50.548 --> 07:40:50.558 align:start position:0%
been harmed by the current and past drug
 
07:40:53.190 --> 07:40:53.200 align:start position:0%
policies uh some states have uh you know
 
07:40:55.150 --> 07:40:55.160 align:start position:0%
quotas or you know different measures of
 
07:40:56.708 --> 07:40:56.718 align:start position:0%
getting people that are at disadvantaged
 
07:40:58.670 --> 07:40:58.680 align:start position:0%
or poor who had been harmed by past drug
 
07:41:01.190 --> 07:41:01.200 align:start position:0%
policies to open cannabis businesses and
 
07:41:03.628 --> 07:41:03.638 align:start position:0%
that does not exist in this uh this
 
07:41:05.670 --> 07:41:05.680 align:start position:0%
legislation uh we have high energy costs
 
07:41:07.548 --> 07:41:07.558 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire so it does take more to
 
07:41:09.150 --> 07:41:09.160 align:start position:0%
grow things indoors we don't have a long
 
07:41:10.910 --> 07:41:10.920 align:start position:0%
outdoor growing season we have increased
 
07:41:12.110 --> 07:41:12.120 align:start position:0%
energy costs there's an there's an
 
07:41:13.910 --> 07:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
environmental impact there's an economic
 
07:41:16.308 --> 07:41:16.318 align:start position:0%
impact of that now we're not allowed to
 
07:41:18.388 --> 07:41:18.398 align:start position:0%
import or export or transport transport
 
07:41:19.788 --> 07:41:19.798 align:start position:0%
across state lines currently but if that
 
07:41:22.910 --> 07:41:22.920 align:start position:0%
changes any growth industry in any uh
 
07:41:24.750 --> 07:41:24.760 align:start position:0%
local growth grow IND growing industry
 
07:41:26.030 --> 07:41:26.040 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire could be seriously
 
07:41:27.150 --> 07:41:27.160 align:start position:0%
impacted and we need to have the
 
07:41:29.990 --> 07:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
flexibility to adapt and and that leads
 
07:41:33.590 --> 07:41:33.600 align:start position:0%
me to my final Point um a free private
 
07:41:36.388 --> 07:41:36.398 align:start position:0%
Market is the most Innovative and well
 
07:41:38.510 --> 07:41:38.520 align:start position:0%
able to adapt and provide what consumers
 
07:41:40.430 --> 07:41:40.440 align:start position:0%
actually want we're basically saying you
 
07:41:41.750 --> 07:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
can't have Edibles you can't have this
 
07:41:43.070 --> 07:41:43.080 align:start position:0%
you can only have this much THC you've
 
07:41:44.548 --> 07:41:44.558 align:start position:0%
got to have it in this package we're
 
07:41:46.270 --> 07:41:46.280 align:start position:0%
going to put on this shelf we're we're
 
07:41:47.628 --> 07:41:47.638 align:start position:0%
it's like we're selling uh government
 
07:41:49.030 --> 07:41:49.040 align:start position:0%
cheese and ESP special store putting a
 
07:41:50.468 --> 07:41:50.478 align:start position:0%
big sign saying look how wonderful we
 
07:41:52.350 --> 07:41:52.360 align:start position:0%
are giving you this but all the places
 
07:41:54.510 --> 07:41:54.520 align:start position:0%
around us are selling like 42 types of
 
07:41:56.750 --> 07:41:56.760 align:start position:0%
salad dressing and we can't do that here
 
07:41:58.230 --> 07:41:58.240 align:start position:0%
you know we're we're trying to limit
 
07:42:00.510 --> 07:42:00.520 align:start position:0%
ourselves and limit our our capability
 
07:42:02.670 --> 07:42:02.680 align:start position:0%
and the the unlimited potential of the
 
07:42:04.708 --> 07:42:04.718 align:start position:0%
people of New Hampshire to to do what is
 
07:42:07.070 --> 07:42:07.080 align:start position:0%
right for for us and our citizens and I
 
07:42:09.350 --> 07:42:09.360 align:start position:0%

and helping with any work session that
 
07:42:13.468 --> 07:42:13.478 align:start position:0%
would amend this bill to make that a
 
07:42:16.510 --> 07:42:16.520 align:start position:0%
reality for New Hampshire and make a um
 
07:42:18.590 --> 07:42:18.600 align:start position:0%
