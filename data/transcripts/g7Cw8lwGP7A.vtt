00:33:22.669 --> 00:33:22.679 align:start position:0%
paragraph that we had a conversation
 
00:33:26.470 --> 00:33:26.480 align:start position:0%
about not only oplc boards but non oplc
 
00:33:30.629 --> 00:33:30.639 align:start position:0%

02:03:03.510 --> 02:03:03.520 align:start position:0%
coming but we had um a lot of work to do
 
02:03:08.510 --> 02:03:08.520 align:start position:0%
on it um this started out in 2022 I was
 
02:03:11.629 --> 02:03:11.639 align:start position:0%
pres it was presented to me um from one
 
02:03:14.189 --> 02:03:14.199 align:start position:0%
of my PTSD commission members had asked
 
02:03:16.870 --> 02:03:16.880 align:start position:0%
me to look into it so I went ahead and I
 
02:03:21.109 --> 02:03:21.119 align:start position:0%
put in 134 and what it you'll be hearing
 
02:03:23.830 --> 02:03:23.840 align:start position:0%
from the two off officers that it's uh
 
02:03:26.390 --> 02:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
basically going to be impacting but um
 
02:03:30.830 --> 02:03:30.840 align:start position:0%
it's it designs a new uh retirement and
 
02:03:34.030 --> 02:03:34.040 align:start position:0%
I worked very closely with Marty Carlin
 
02:03:36.589 --> 02:03:36.599 align:start position:0%
um and this is a new provision for
 
02:03:39.270 --> 02:03:39.280 align:start position:0%
retirements um a new provision for
 
02:03:41.390 --> 02:03:41.400 align:start position:0%

02:03:46.310 --> 02:03:46.320 align:start position:0%
me and or death retirement
 
02:03:48.709 --> 02:03:48.719 align:start position:0%
benefits um it contained ambiguous
 
02:03:50.750 --> 02:03:50.760 align:start position:0%
provisions and inconsistencies with
 
02:03:52.430 --> 02:03:52.440 align:start position:0%
current law which could have hindered
 
02:03:54.229 --> 02:03:54.239 align:start position:0%
proper implementation of the bill is
 
02:03:56.589 --> 02:03:56.599 align:start position:0%
which is why I went ahead um it was
 
02:03:58.629 --> 02:03:58.639 align:start position:0%
presented in J
 
02:04:02.510 --> 02:04:02.520 align:start position:0%

02:04:40.589 --> 02:04:40.599 align:start position:0%
revising The Med medical subsidy and
 
02:04:42.950 --> 02:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
requiring medical
 
02:04:45.189 --> 02:04:45.199 align:start position:0%
reexamination um this went through the
 
02:04:48.069 --> 02:04:48.079 align:start position:0%
Senate finance committee I believe last
 
02:04:52.350 --> 02:04:52.360 align:start position:0%
week and um we brought it to the floor
 
02:04:54.910 --> 02:04:54.920 align:start position:0%
last Thursday and that is why you have
 
02:04:59.149 --> 02:04:59.159 align:start position:0%
it right here um and I do I can have my
 
02:05:02.229 --> 02:05:02.239 align:start position:0%
admin send you a listing I have a um
 
02:05:04.350 --> 02:05:04.360 align:start position:0%
Marty was really good about putting
 
02:05:05.669 --> 02:05:05.679 align:start position:0%
together I had asked him to put together
 
02:05:08.310 --> 02:05:08.320 align:start position:0%
a comparison sheet one with the uh
 
02:05:11.790 --> 02:05:11.800 align:start position:0%
current group two job related what 134
 
02:05:13.589 --> 02:05:13.599 align:start position:0%
initially wanted and then what we
 
02:05:16.790 --> 02:05:16.800 align:start position:0%
finally came up with so I can have um my
 
02:05:19.189 --> 02:05:19.199 align:start position:0%
admin send it to the chair and she can
 
02:05:21.870 --> 02:05:21.880 align:start position:0%
get it out to Youk we we definitely want
 
02:05:24.270 --> 02:05:24.280 align:start position:0%
the comparison of what 134 as it
 
02:05:28.109 --> 02:05:28.119 align:start position:0%
currently exists versus the basic uh
 
02:05:31.430 --> 02:05:31.440 align:start position:0%
retirement benefits yep we're not really
 
02:05:33.229 --> 02:05:33.239 align:start position:0%
too worried about what you fixed in the
 
02:05:34.990 --> 02:05:35.000 align:start position:0%
Senate because we we don't need to worry
 
02:05:37.350 --> 02:05:37.360 align:start position:0%
about it if you took care of it there
 
02:05:39.310 --> 02:05:39.320 align:start position:0%
might there might be some tweaks that me
 
02:05:41.549 --> 02:05:41.559 align:start position:0%
we might have to make with it but other
 
02:05:43.270 --> 02:05:43.280 align:start position:0%
than that I think uh we can do that
 
02:05:43.280 --> 02:05:45.470 align:start position:0%
than that I think uh we can do that
pretty

02:05:45.470 --> 02:05:45.480 align:start position:0%
pretty
 
02:05:47.830 --> 02:05:47.840 align:start position:0%
quickly okay you're on no times
 
02:05:50.750 --> 02:05:50.760 align:start position:0%
constraint I know yes thank you are
 
02:05:53.390 --> 02:05:53.400 align:start position:0%
there any questions representative leus
 
02:05:55.229 --> 02:05:55.239 align:start position:0%
and then representative Schmid thank you
 
02:05:58.549 --> 02:05:58.559 align:start position:0%
this is um concerning the fiscal note um
 
02:06:01.149 --> 02:06:01.159 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if the dollar amounts
 
02:06:03.870 --> 02:06:03.880 align:start position:0%
reflect the final bill that came out of
 
02:06:05.510 --> 02:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
the Senate I noticed there are things in
 
02:06:08.229 --> 02:06:08.239 align:start position:0%
here which don't like the methodology
 
02:06:10.790 --> 02:06:10.800 align:start position:0%
still list the cola correct that is
 
02:06:12.790 --> 02:06:12.800 align:start position:0%
actually why I started working on it
 
02:06:16.870 --> 02:06:16.880 align:start position:0%
because it was such a um high price tag
 
02:06:19.430 --> 02:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
so that's why I worked with it I don't
 
02:06:22.510 --> 02:06:22.520 align:start position:0%
we don't have a current um fiscal note
 
02:06:22.520 --> 02:06:24.629 align:start position:0%
we don't have a current um fiscal note
on

02:06:24.629 --> 02:06:24.639 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:06:27.750 --> 02:06:27.760 align:start position:0%
it okay representative
 
02:06:30.669 --> 02:06:30.679 align:start position:0%
Schmidt thank you madam chair so good

02:06:36.669 --> 02:06:36.679 align:start position:0%
brought at the request of any particular
 
02:06:39.830 --> 02:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
group it was brought as a request from
 
02:06:43.229 --> 02:06:43.239 align:start position:0%
um the two police officers that uh were
 
02:06:45.589 --> 02:06:45.599 align:start position:0%
in affected and anyone in the future
 
02:06:48.910 --> 02:06:48.920 align:start position:0%
that's affected by a violent act um with
 
02:06:52.910 --> 02:06:52.920 align:start position:0%
a deadly weapon thank you
 
02:06:54.990 --> 02:06:55.000 align:start position:0%
questions all right thank you very much
 
02:06:57.390 --> 02:06:57.400 align:start position:0%
Senator yes I'd like to hear from Mr
 
02:06:59.750 --> 02:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
Carlin on definition of what this is
 
02:06:59.760 --> 02:07:08.870 align:start position:0%
Carlin on definition of what this is
actually

02:07:08.870 --> 02:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:32.790 --> 02:07:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:34.270 --> 02:07:34.280 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair while those are
 
02:07:36.109 --> 02:07:36.119 align:start position:0%
making their way around I'll introduce
 
02:07:39.030 --> 02:07:39.040 align:start position:0%
myself um Marty Carlin representing the
 
02:07:42.149 --> 02:07:42.159 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire retirement system uh nhrs
 
02:07:44.430 --> 02:07:44.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a position on this bill
 
02:07:46.750 --> 02:07:46.760 align:start position:0%
either way it's it's a policy decision
 
02:07:48.990 --> 02:07:49.000 align:start position:0%
for the
 
02:07:50.830 --> 02:07:50.840 align:start position:0%
legislature does everybody have a
 
02:07:54.790 --> 02:07:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:58.669 --> 02:07:58.679 align:start position:0%
um so as um as Senator berzel stated
 
02:08:00.870 --> 02:08:00.880 align:start position:0%
when she introduced the bill uh this was
 
02:08:03.629 --> 02:08:03.639 align:start position:0%
a bill from last year that was retained
 
02:08:06.069 --> 02:08:06.079 align:start position:0%
in the Senate R retained in committee
 
02:08:09.030 --> 02:08:09.040 align:start position:0%
and um amended on uh the opening day of
 
02:08:12.390 --> 02:08:12.400 align:start position:0%
the session uh we still had um several
 
02:08:14.629 --> 02:08:14.639 align:start position:0%
Technical and mechanical concerns with
 
02:08:17.709 --> 02:08:17.719 align:start position:0%
that bill as as amended uh and I reached
 
02:08:20.549 --> 02:08:20.559 align:start position:0%
out to Senator berzel um and we've had
 
02:08:22.629 --> 02:08:22.639 align:start position:0%
several conversations over the months
 
02:08:25.990 --> 02:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
about trying to uh get something that
 
02:08:29.149 --> 02:08:29.159 align:start position:0%
met the intention of the of the the bill
 
02:08:31.149 --> 02:08:31.159 align:start position:0%
uh and it was also able for nhrs to
 
02:08:32.430 --> 02:08:32.440 align:start position:0%
administer it
 
02:08:34.910 --> 02:08:34.920 align:start position:0%
effectively um so the
 
02:08:37.510 --> 02:08:37.520 align:start position:0%
handout that I gave you was a side by
 
02:08:40.990 --> 02:08:41.000 align:start position:0%
side um of the current group two job
 
02:08:42.790 --> 02:08:42.800 align:start position:0%
related disability benefit which is
 
02:08:44.830 --> 02:08:44.840 align:start position:0%
referred to as accidental disability in
 
02:08:47.990 --> 02:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
the statute um the Senate Bill 134
 
02:08:50.549 --> 02:08:50.559 align:start position:0%
doesn't replace that rather it creates a
 
02:08:52.830 --> 02:08:52.840 align:start position:0%
third level of disability for group to
 
02:08:55.950 --> 02:08:55.960 align:start position:0%
only uh you know the violent attack uh
 
02:08:57.950 --> 02:08:57.960 align:start position:0%
violent accidental disability do you
 
02:09:01.270 --> 02:09:01.280 align:start position:0%
mean that someone who qualifies under
 
02:09:04.589 --> 02:09:04.599 align:start position:0%
this new benefit is also eligible to the
 
02:09:08.109 --> 02:09:08.119 align:start position:0%
regular disability benefit it they not
 
02:09:09.990 --> 02:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
both it would it would be neither or
 
02:09:11.390 --> 02:09:11.400 align:start position:0%
it's like there there's a lot of people
 
02:09:13.830 --> 02:09:13.840 align:start position:0%
who are injured on the job but you know
 
02:09:17.030 --> 02:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
their their injury was accidental or not
 
02:09:19.149 --> 02:09:19.159 align:start position:0%
a violent intent or things like that
 
02:09:20.709 --> 02:09:20.719 align:start position:0%
where they would still qualify under
 
02:09:25.350 --> 02:09:25.360 align:start position:0%
this this this carves out a a what what
 
02:09:27.830 --> 02:09:27.840 align:start position:0%
um the expectation is is a very small
 
02:09:30.709 --> 02:09:30.719 align:start position:0%
niche of people you know who were you
 
02:09:33.189 --> 02:09:33.199 align:start position:0%
know you know shot chasing someone uh
 
02:09:34.629 --> 02:09:34.639 align:start position:0%
you know things like that or you know
 
02:09:38.149 --> 02:09:38.159 align:start position:0%
just just you know violent attacks um
 
02:09:39.910 --> 02:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
that prevent them from going forward as
 
02:09:43.310 --> 02:09:43.320 align:start position:0%
opposed to you know a car crash you know
 
02:09:44.709 --> 02:09:44.719 align:start position:0%
where it was there was no intent it was
 
02:09:46.430 --> 02:09:46.440 align:start position:0%
an accident but they still aren't aable
 
02:09:48.390 --> 02:09:48.400 align:start position:0%
to work that the existing disability
 
02:09:51.030 --> 02:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
benefit would be would remain so it' be
 
02:09:51.040 --> 02:09:51.950 align:start position:0%
benefit would be would remain so it' be
three

02:09:51.950 --> 02:09:51.960 align:start position:0%
three
 
02:09:54.189 --> 02:09:54.199 align:start position:0%
three levels of
 
02:09:56.990 --> 02:09:57.000 align:start position:0%
disability and for act for job related
 
02:10:00.030 --> 02:10:00.040 align:start position:0%
disability in group one and group two uh
 
02:10:02.390 --> 02:10:02.400 align:start position:0%
basically this can happen to as long as
 
02:10:05.229 --> 02:10:05.239 align:start position:0%
it's a work rated injury um you know you
 
02:10:06.830 --> 02:10:06.840 align:start position:0%
can qualify for this at any point in
 
02:10:08.549 --> 02:10:08.559 align:start position:0%
your career somebody early on in their
 
02:10:12.470 --> 02:10:12.480 align:start position:0%
career could be injured or or a veteran
 
02:10:14.990 --> 02:10:15.000 align:start position:0%
um many years in um the current
 
02:10:18.030 --> 02:10:18.040 align:start position:0%
disability benefit has a um you know
 
02:10:19.950 --> 02:10:19.960 align:start position:0%
there's a definition accident repeated
 
02:10:22.149 --> 02:10:22.159 align:start position:0%
trauma gradual degradation while on the
 
02:10:25.589 --> 02:10:25.599 align:start position:0%
job or job related occupational disease
 
02:10:27.229 --> 02:10:27.239 align:start position:0%
um typically we look to the Department
 
02:10:29.669 --> 02:10:29.679 align:start position:0%
of Labor uh for determination on whether
 
02:10:32.750 --> 02:10:32.760 align:start position:0%
on the work relatedness piece uh for for
 
02:10:35.750 --> 02:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
that and if if the qualifications are
 
02:10:37.470 --> 02:10:37.480 align:start position:0%
met in the
 
02:10:39.910 --> 02:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
independent Med medical examiner finds
 
02:10:41.669 --> 02:10:41.679 align:start position:0%
that the the disability is likely to be
 
02:10:43.109 --> 02:10:43.119 align:start position:0%
permanent and would prevent them from
 
02:10:44.629 --> 02:10:44.639 align:start position:0%
doing that job going forward they're
 
02:10:47.910 --> 02:10:47.920 align:start position:0%
they're granted a benefit um the new
 
02:10:52.350 --> 02:10:52.360 align:start position:0%
bill has a a more strict and limited um
 
02:10:54.510 --> 02:10:54.520 align:start position:0%
definition um someone who has been
 
02:10:56.430 --> 02:10:56.440 align:start position:0%
totally and permanently incapacitated
 
02:10:58.910 --> 02:10:58.920 align:start position:0%
for Duty as the result of a purposeful
 
02:11:00.950 --> 02:11:00.960 align:start position:0%
hostile and violent attack upon such
 
02:11:03.589 --> 02:11:03.599 align:start position:0%
member in the line of duty uh in this
 
02:11:05.709 --> 02:11:05.719 align:start position:0%
section the definition of purposeful
 
02:11:07.589 --> 02:11:07.599 align:start position:0%
hostile and violent attack means a
 
02:11:10.310 --> 02:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
physical attack with a deadly weapon as
 
02:11:12.229 --> 02:11:12.239 align:start position:0%
defined in RSA
 
02:11:14.830 --> 02:11:14.840 align:start position:0%
62515 done with conscious intent and
 
02:11:16.270 --> 02:11:16.280 align:start position:0%
with such force that it results in the
 
02:11:18.669 --> 02:11:18.679 align:start position:0%
infliction of serious bodily injury as
 
02:11:21.589 --> 02:11:21.599 align:start position:0%
defined in RSA 625 1116 that's a
 
02:11:24.629 --> 02:11:24.639 align:start position:0%
criminal statute um defining uh you know
 
02:11:26.510 --> 02:11:26.520 align:start position:0%
assault with a deadly weapon so that
 
02:11:27.910 --> 02:11:27.920 align:start position:0%
that's that's where the reference was
 
02:11:30.709 --> 02:11:30.719 align:start position:0%
there um that was in the original
 
02:11:33.270 --> 02:11:33.280 align:start position:0%
amended version of the bill but that
 
02:11:36.549 --> 02:11:36.559 align:start position:0%
that left sort of a gap as you know nhrs
 
02:11:39.430 --> 02:11:39.440 align:start position:0%
it's boor its staff aren't qualified
 
02:11:42.510 --> 02:11:42.520 align:start position:0%
investigators um you know to look at a
 
02:11:43.790 --> 02:11:43.800 align:start position:0%
situation like that and make a
 
02:11:45.830 --> 02:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
determination whether the the definition
 
02:11:49.790 --> 02:11:49.800 align:start position:0%
was met um so um Senator berzel reached
 
02:11:51.510 --> 02:11:51.520 align:start position:0%
out we we had original only thought
 
02:11:53.069 --> 02:11:53.079 align:start position:0%
maybe the AG's office would be the
 
02:11:56.790 --> 02:11:56.800 align:start position:0%
appropriate body they um um didn't feel
 
02:11:59.270 --> 02:11:59.280 align:start position:0%
it was in their wheelhouse and um the
 
02:12:01.910 --> 02:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
commissioner of safety however um was
 
02:12:04.910 --> 02:12:04.920 align:start position:0%
open for being the the person who would
 
02:12:07.790 --> 02:12:07.800 align:start position:0%
review the um the record and and make
 
02:12:09.629 --> 02:12:09.639 align:start position:0%
that certification to the board so they
 
02:12:11.870 --> 02:12:11.880 align:start position:0%
could move forward with this benefit the
 
02:12:13.510 --> 02:12:13.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner and the staff over at
 
02:12:16.790 --> 02:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
safety already do this for that $100,000
 
02:12:19.189 --> 02:12:19.199 align:start position:0%
line of duty death benefit um that's not
 
02:12:23.030 --> 02:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
in our statute but um as well as for
 
02:12:26.069 --> 02:12:26.079 align:start position:0%
issues with Troopers injured on the job
 
02:12:27.589 --> 02:12:27.599 align:start position:0%
and whether they're have to use their
 
02:12:29.189 --> 02:12:29.199 align:start position:0%
sick time or not depending on the nature
 
02:12:31.629 --> 02:12:31.639 align:start position:0%
so there's a sort of a structure and a
 
02:12:33.669 --> 02:12:33.679 align:start position:0%
process and an actual actually a statute
 
02:12:36.549 --> 02:12:36.559 align:start position:0%
governing how that is done over there so
 
02:12:39.709 --> 02:12:39.719 align:start position:0%
um the attorney from safety provided
 
02:12:41.510 --> 02:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
that language to us which we provided to
 
02:12:44.149 --> 02:12:44.159 align:start position:0%
Senator bird cell so we have a we have a
 
02:12:47.270 --> 02:12:47.280 align:start position:0%
clearer definition than we did we have a
 
02:12:50.589 --> 02:12:50.599 align:start position:0%
qualified body making that determination
 
02:12:50.599 --> 02:12:51.910 align:start position:0%
qualified body making that determination
um

02:12:51.910 --> 02:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:12:53.870 --> 02:12:53.880 align:start position:0%
and um so so we feel it's it's
 
02:12:55.629 --> 02:12:55.639 align:start position:0%
administer at this
 
02:12:55.639 --> 02:12:58.149 align:start position:0%
administer at this
point

02:12:58.149 --> 02:12:58.159 align:start position:0%
point
 
02:13:01.950 --> 02:13:01.960 align:start position:0%
um there um so what happens if someone
 
02:13:03.510 --> 02:13:03.520 align:start position:0%
qualifies for this and they they meet
 
02:13:05.709 --> 02:13:05.719 align:start position:0%
the medical criteria as well um the
 
02:13:06.950 --> 02:13:06.960 align:start position:0%
benefit is going to be a little
 
02:13:09.149 --> 02:13:09.159 align:start position:0%
different than the current accidental
 
02:13:11.510 --> 02:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
disability benefit for group two uh
 
02:13:13.830 --> 02:13:13.840 align:start position:0%
which is 66 and 23 of their average
 
02:13:15.870 --> 02:13:15.880 align:start position:0%
final compensation whether that's a high
 
02:13:18.669 --> 02:13:18.679 align:start position:0%
three or a high five um that's that's
 
02:13:21.390 --> 02:13:21.400 align:start position:0%
the um and there's also because it's a
 
02:13:23.549 --> 02:13:23.559 align:start position:0%
set amount if the person who is
 
02:13:26.109 --> 02:13:26.119 align:start position:0%
injured has more years of service so
 
02:13:27.669 --> 02:13:27.679 align:start position:0%
that their service retirement would have
 
02:13:29.750 --> 02:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
a larger percentage of their ASC there's
 
02:13:31.430 --> 02:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
a supplemental benefit to make them
 
02:13:35.589 --> 02:13:35.599 align:start position:0%
whole for anything above 66 and 23 that
 
02:13:38.709 --> 02:13:38.719 align:start position:0%
66 and 2/3 is a a taxfree benefit
 
02:13:41.310 --> 02:13:41.320 align:start position:0%
because it's a a job related disability
 
02:13:43.350 --> 02:13:43.360 align:start position:0%
um the supplemental is not so that's the
 
02:13:43.360 --> 02:13:44.310 align:start position:0%
um the supplemental is not so that's the
current

02:13:44.310 --> 02:13:44.320 align:start position:0%
current
 
02:13:50.189 --> 02:13:50.199 align:start position:0%
law the change in this um senet Bill 134
 
02:13:52.470 --> 02:13:52.480 align:start position:0%
it's 100% % of the member's annual rate
 
02:13:54.350 --> 02:13:54.360 align:start position:0%
of earnable compensation so whatever
 
02:13:56.390 --> 02:13:56.400 align:start position:0%
their salary was in the last 12 months
 
02:13:58.910 --> 02:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
would be the benefit amount or
 
02:14:01.229 --> 02:14:01.239 align:start position:0%
$75,000 whichever is greater so it
 
02:14:04.629 --> 02:14:04.639 align:start position:0%
creates a floor benefit um
 
02:14:07.430 --> 02:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
for the uh you know for for this
 
02:14:09.470 --> 02:14:09.480 align:start position:0%
particular benefit so that that that's
 
02:14:10.750 --> 02:14:10.760 align:start position:0%
the benefit
 
02:14:12.629 --> 02:14:12.639 align:start position:0%
structure do you want me to keep going
 
02:14:14.109 --> 02:14:14.119 align:start position:0%
or do you want to take questions on that
 
02:14:16.189 --> 02:14:16.199 align:start position:0%
or U let's see if there are questions
 
02:14:22.229 --> 02:14:22.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:23.910 --> 02:14:23.920 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you Mr
 
02:14:28.030 --> 02:14:28.040 align:start position:0%
Carlin uh good afternoon um I assume
 
02:14:32.430 --> 02:14:32.440 align:start position:0%
that you have numbers of the amount of
 
02:14:35.709 --> 02:14:35.719 align:start position:0%
people who are currently uh receiving
 
02:14:38.390 --> 02:14:38.400 align:start position:0%
benefits Under The
 
02:14:41.830 --> 02:14:41.840 align:start position:0%
Accidental portion can you share with us
 
02:14:44.510 --> 02:14:44.520 align:start position:0%
how many that would be and do you have
 
02:14:47.270 --> 02:14:47.280 align:start position:0%
any kind of an estimate how many might
 
02:14:51.709 --> 02:14:51.719 align:start position:0%
of those might apply under the other um
 
02:14:56.310 --> 02:14:56.320 align:start position:0%
there there is approximately between 400
 
02:14:59.669 --> 02:14:59.679 align:start position:0%
450 accidental group two disability
 
02:15:03.030 --> 02:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
recipients currently um without without
 
02:15:05.270 --> 02:15:05.280 align:start position:0%
having looking back into the files and
 
02:15:06.870 --> 02:15:06.880 align:start position:0%
looking at the The Narrative of their
 
02:15:09.709 --> 02:15:09.719 align:start position:0%
cases it's hard to say um how many would
 
02:15:12.589 --> 02:15:12.599 align:start position:0%
have qualified th this bill does in
 
02:15:15.229 --> 02:15:15.239 align:start position:0%
section two contain session law though
 
02:15:18.270 --> 02:15:18.280 align:start position:0%
that it's a look back for anyone who
 
02:15:20.270 --> 02:15:20.280 align:start position:0%
retired under group two accidental
 
02:15:23.950 --> 02:15:23.960 align:start position:0%
disability on or after 7 one of 18 can
 
02:15:25.870 --> 02:15:25.880 align:start position:0%
come back and apply for this still go
 
02:15:29.510 --> 02:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
through the certification process um
 
02:15:32.390 --> 02:15:32.400 align:start position:0%
that's not a magic date um there may be
 
02:15:33.549 --> 02:15:33.559 align:start position:0%
some people who may have been injured
 
02:15:36.709 --> 02:15:36.719 align:start position:0%
before that or not um you know there's
 
02:15:39.669 --> 02:15:39.679 align:start position:0%
you know there's a few uh actually had
 
02:15:42.109 --> 02:15:42.119 align:start position:0%
spoken to a couple of folks who are you
 
02:15:44.990 --> 02:15:45.000 align:start position:0%
know have are retired under these
 
02:15:47.069 --> 02:15:47.079 align:start position:0%
circumstances Googling I thought of a
 
02:15:48.750 --> 02:15:48.760 align:start position:0%
couple of other high-profile things that
 
02:15:50.270 --> 02:15:50.280 align:start position:0%
were stuck in my mind and and so you
 
02:15:51.910 --> 02:15:51.920 align:start position:0%
know there's there's probably you know
 
02:15:54.750 --> 02:15:54.760 align:start position:0%
more than there's at least two and more
 
02:15:57.790 --> 02:15:57.800 align:start position:0%
than x um you know but the look back
 
02:16:00.229 --> 02:16:00.239 align:start position:0%
right now in this in the bill is till um
 
02:16:02.270 --> 02:16:02.280 align:start position:0%
71 of 18 so that's a retroactive
 
02:16:04.830 --> 02:16:04.840 align:start position:0%
application it wouldn't be the benefit
 
02:16:06.549 --> 02:16:06.559 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be retroactive to the date it
 
02:16:08.629 --> 02:16:08.639 align:start position:0%
would be start with the with the grant
 
02:16:12.990 --> 02:16:13.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:15.589 --> 02:16:15.599 align:start position:0%
disability other questions
 
02:16:20.589 --> 02:16:20.599 align:start position:0%
represent no represent LE thank you um
 
02:16:24.549 --> 02:16:24.559 align:start position:0%
so so for the uh the new benefit says
 
02:16:28.310 --> 02:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
that it would be 100% or or 75,000 but
 
02:16:31.229 --> 02:16:31.239 align:start position:0%
says it would be taxfree it can it be if
 
02:16:34.790 --> 02:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
it's 100% under the federal yeah um it
 
02:16:36.709 --> 02:16:36.719 align:start position:0%
yeah I I I think I think there was a
 
02:16:38.629 --> 02:16:38.639 align:start position:0%
dollar limit or something with with
 
02:16:41.190 --> 02:16:41.200 align:start position:0%
taxability of of debility benefits but
 
02:16:41.200 --> 02:16:43.270 align:start position:0%
taxability of of debility benefits but
these

02:16:43.270 --> 02:16:43.280 align:start position:0%
these
 
02:16:45.669 --> 02:16:45.679 align:start position:0%
these my understanding from our lawyers
 
02:16:47.309 --> 02:16:47.319 align:start position:0%
is that that it would all be a taxfree
 
02:16:50.270 --> 02:16:50.280 align:start position:0%
benefit okay thank you and well followup
 
02:16:50.280 --> 02:16:51.549 align:start position:0%
benefit okay thank you and well followup
followup

02:16:51.549 --> 02:16:51.559 align:start position:0%
followup
 
02:16:54.190 --> 02:16:54.200 align:start position:0%
um I know in the original or the the
 
02:16:57.549 --> 02:16:57.559 align:start position:0%
fiscal note we have has a fairly
 
02:16:57.559 --> 02:16:59.230 align:start position:0%
fiscal note we have has a fairly
substantial

02:16:59.230 --> 02:16:59.240 align:start position:0%
substantial
 
02:17:02.110 --> 02:17:02.120 align:start position:0%
cost um I don't know to what extent the
 
02:17:03.950 --> 02:17:03.960 align:start position:0%
Chang in the bill modified that but is
 
02:17:05.830 --> 02:17:05.840 align:start position:0%
there some idea of what the change in
 
02:17:07.549 --> 02:17:07.559 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note would be yeah it's going
 
02:17:09.549 --> 02:17:09.559 align:start position:0%
to be significantly less than that
 
02:17:11.709 --> 02:17:11.719 align:start position:0%
number I I I looked at when I printed
 
02:17:12.910 --> 02:17:12.920 align:start position:0%
out the bill this morning I looked at
 
02:17:15.629 --> 02:17:15.639 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note and because of the way
 
02:17:18.389 --> 02:17:18.399 align:start position:0%
the amendment was drafted it it
 
02:17:21.950 --> 02:17:21.960 align:start position:0%
was fairly open-ended so the ACT assumed
 
02:17:24.070 --> 02:17:24.080 align:start position:0%
essentially that half the population who
 
02:17:25.950 --> 02:17:25.960 align:start position:0%
retire on disability would get this
 
02:17:28.270 --> 02:17:28.280 align:start position:0%
benefit and that you know with with this
 
02:17:30.110 --> 02:17:30.120 align:start position:0%
definition that that's a much more
 
02:17:33.750 --> 02:17:33.760 align:start position:0%
narrower uh group than than 50% you know
 
02:17:35.910 --> 02:17:35.920 align:start position:0%
I couldn't put a percentage on it but I
 
02:17:38.830 --> 02:17:38.840 align:start position:0%
mean this this is you know these events
 
02:17:41.750 --> 02:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
happen you know not
 
02:17:44.309 --> 02:17:44.319 align:start position:0%
often you know these limited attack
 
02:17:46.429 --> 02:17:46.439 align:start position:0%
events so so that fiscal note def you
 
02:17:49.910 --> 02:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
know um is is irrelevant to the current
 
02:17:51.469 --> 02:17:51.479 align:start position:0%
bill that the Senate amended and sent
 
02:17:54.469 --> 02:17:54.479 align:start position:0%
over one more followup one more followup
 
02:17:56.950 --> 02:17:56.960 align:start position:0%
um okay I didn't see anything in here
 
02:17:59.389 --> 02:17:59.399 align:start position:0%
funding this so is it am I correct in
 
02:18:01.429 --> 02:18:01.439 align:start position:0%
assuming this is going to increase the
 
02:18:06.270 --> 02:18:06.280 align:start position:0%
uh uh unfunded liability it again if if
 
02:18:09.230 --> 02:18:09.240 align:start position:0%
you know the the stated intent um over
 
02:18:11.549 --> 02:18:11.559 align:start position:0%
in the Senate and the the definition we
 
02:18:13.110 --> 02:18:13.120 align:start position:0%
believe it's going to be a very limited
 
02:18:14.589 --> 02:18:14.599 align:start position:0%
number of people who would receive this
 
02:18:17.509 --> 02:18:17.519 align:start position:0%
benefit to the extent that those folks
 
02:18:20.509 --> 02:18:20.519 align:start position:0%
are getting more under this benefit than
 
02:18:23.469 --> 02:18:23.479 align:start position:0%
they are under the current accidental
 
02:18:25.230 --> 02:18:25.240 align:start position:0%
disability benefit that would obviously
 
02:18:28.750 --> 02:18:28.760 align:start position:0%
increase costs um you know for funding
 
02:18:31.389 --> 02:18:31.399 align:start position:0%
the plan it depending on the number of
 
02:18:33.589 --> 02:18:33.599 align:start position:0%
people who qualify it it may or may not
 
02:18:35.150 --> 02:18:35.160 align:start position:0%
show up in the rates you know it may be
 
02:18:37.110 --> 02:18:37.120 align:start position:0%
in the rounding and it there's a cost
 
02:18:39.790 --> 02:18:39.800 align:start position:0%
but it's it's uh di Minimus enough where
 
02:18:42.509 --> 02:18:42.519 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't be obvious um we don't you
 
02:18:46.110 --> 02:18:46.120 align:start position:0%
know you know so that and that would um
 
02:18:47.549 --> 02:18:47.559 align:start position:0%
kind of show up over time with
 
02:18:49.709 --> 02:18:49.719 align:start position:0%
experience as you know that this has
 
02:18:50.990 --> 02:18:51.000 align:start position:0%
been on the books for a few years years
 
02:18:52.389 --> 02:18:52.399 align:start position:0%
we see how many people are getting it
 
02:18:54.110 --> 02:18:54.120 align:start position:0%
the ACT will have some data to make a
 
02:18:55.669 --> 02:18:55.679 align:start position:0%
projection going forward for future
 
02:18:58.270 --> 02:18:58.280 align:start position:0%
rates okay thank
 
02:19:01.150 --> 02:19:01.160 align:start position:0%
you there would be no unfunded piece um
 
02:19:02.990 --> 02:19:03.000 align:start position:0%
it it would just be a normal cost
 
02:19:05.190 --> 02:19:05.200 align:start position:0%
increase I I believe
 
02:19:07.910 --> 02:19:07.920 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you madam chair um yeah just
 
02:19:10.589 --> 02:19:10.599 align:start position:0%
looking on the second to last page of
 
02:19:13.230 --> 02:19:13.240 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note there um where it said
 
02:19:14.790 --> 02:19:14.800 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire retirement system
 
02:19:16.990 --> 02:19:17.000 align:start position:0%
actuary projects an increase to the actu
 
02:19:20.389 --> 02:19:20.399 align:start position:0%
acud liability of 87.6 million you're
 
02:19:22.549 --> 02:19:22.559 align:start position:0%
saying that would be if 50% of the
 
02:19:24.790 --> 02:19:24.800 align:start position:0%
people were receiving the
 
02:19:28.150 --> 02:19:28.160 align:start position:0%
benefit yeah and I I I know that it's
 
02:19:29.549 --> 02:19:29.559 align:start position:0%
not going to be that much in this but
 
02:19:31.549 --> 02:19:31.559 align:start position:0%
that's that's what it was based off of
 
02:19:34.549 --> 02:19:34.559 align:start position:0%
yes and I I I think the or the version
 
02:19:36.469 --> 02:19:36.479 align:start position:0%
who never saw the the previously amended
 
02:19:39.270 --> 02:19:39.280 align:start position:0%
version I think it was a it was a look
 
02:19:41.349 --> 02:19:41.359 align:start position:0%
back to everyone who was retired as well
 
02:19:42.790 --> 02:19:42.800 align:start position:0%
so that's that's where the unfunded
 
02:19:44.950 --> 02:19:44.960 align:start position:0%
piece would have come in on that um you
 
02:19:47.910 --> 02:19:47.920 align:start position:0%
know you know honestly that you know it
 
02:19:49.510 --> 02:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
had enough drafting issues where it was
 
02:19:52.710 --> 02:19:52.720 align:start position:0%
really hard for them to Val so they went
 
02:19:54.870 --> 02:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
very conservative on it um because
 
02:19:57.389 --> 02:19:57.399 align:start position:0%
because of the ambiguities in the bill
 
02:20:00.070 --> 02:20:00.080 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you other
 
02:20:03.510 --> 02:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
questions I have one
 
02:20:06.550 --> 02:20:06.560 align:start position:0%
um still looking at the fiscal note
 
02:20:10.550 --> 02:20:10.560 align:start position:0%
there's a whole lot of issues with the
 
02:20:13.550 --> 02:20:13.560 align:start position:0%
with the language and the interpretation
 
02:20:17.429 --> 02:20:17.439 align:start position:0%
have those been resolved yes we we um
 
02:20:19.910 --> 02:20:19.920 align:start position:0%
yeah we we this the version you have in
 
02:20:23.550 --> 02:20:23.560 align:start position:0%
front of you we we've reviewed as has um
 
02:20:25.150 --> 02:20:25.160 align:start position:0%
folks in the risk management unit and
 
02:20:27.990 --> 02:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
admin services and safety and and nobody
 
02:20:30.910 --> 02:20:30.920 align:start position:0%
had any um obvious concerns with with
 
02:20:32.830 --> 02:20:32.840 align:start position:0%
the the amended version that the Senate
 
02:20:35.070 --> 02:20:35.080 align:start position:0%
passed last week
 
02:20:39.750 --> 02:20:39.760 align:start position:0%
okay um so if you flip the page um
 
02:20:41.349 --> 02:20:41.359 align:start position:0%
there's a couple of other boxes on the
 
02:20:44.030 --> 02:20:44.040 align:start position:0%
back uh the you know the the eligibility
 
02:20:47.590 --> 02:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
and the benefit uh levels are larger
 
02:20:50.990 --> 02:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
there's also um gainful occupation which
 
02:20:53.910 --> 02:20:53.920 align:start position:0%
is the top row on the second page that's
 
02:20:56.550 --> 02:20:56.560 align:start position:0%
a provision in the law right now where
 
02:20:58.270 --> 02:20:58.280 align:start position:0%
if someone is receiving a disability
 
02:21:00.590 --> 02:21:00.600 align:start position:0%
Group one or group to job related or
 
02:21:02.950 --> 02:21:02.960 align:start position:0%
non-job related there are limits on how
 
02:21:05.750 --> 02:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
much income they can earn in retirement
 
02:21:07.349 --> 02:21:07.359 align:start position:0%
without offsetting their disability
 
02:21:09.190 --> 02:21:09.200 align:start position:0%
benefit you know so there's a there's a
 
02:21:11.990 --> 02:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
formula involved in that um for current
 
02:21:15.110 --> 02:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
group two accidental disability uh once
 
02:21:17.510 --> 02:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
the person turns 45 and would have had
 
02:21:19.030 --> 02:21:19.040 align:start position:0%
20 years of service there's no more
 
02:21:21.510 --> 02:21:21.520 align:start position:0%
gainful occupation for this new level
 
02:21:23.590 --> 02:21:23.600 align:start position:0%
there would be no gainful occupation at
 
02:21:26.550 --> 02:21:26.560 align:start position:0%
all so the person could get the violent
 
02:21:28.190 --> 02:21:28.200 align:start position:0%
accidental disability benefit and if
 
02:21:30.469 --> 02:21:30.479 align:start position:0%
they were able to work in a another
 
02:21:32.990 --> 02:21:33.000 align:start position:0%
capacity and and you know be compensated
 
02:21:34.670 --> 02:21:34.680 align:start position:0%
for that it wouldn't offset their their
 
02:21:38.830 --> 02:21:38.840 align:start position:0%
disability benefit from nhrs isn't that
 
02:21:41.550 --> 02:21:41.560 align:start position:0%
a isn't that an issue with with the
 
02:21:45.230 --> 02:21:45.240 align:start position:0%
taxability of it well they're their
 
02:21:46.830 --> 02:21:46.840 align:start position:0%
income from other employment would be
 
02:21:50.070 --> 02:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
taxable and I I I don't I I will bring
 
02:21:53.230 --> 02:21:53.240 align:start position:0%
that back to our um to our legal folks
 
02:21:54.790 --> 02:21:54.800 align:start position:0%
because that didn't come up in our
 
02:21:56.910 --> 02:21:56.920 align:start position:0%
internal discussions and and one of them
 
02:21:59.150 --> 02:21:59.160 align:start position:0%
is a former tax attorney so and it's
 
02:22:01.349 --> 02:22:01.359 align:start position:0%
always a but I still want to double
 
02:22:03.750 --> 02:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
checking for you okay
 
02:22:06.150 --> 02:22:06.160 align:start position:0%
um and then the the last piece is
 
02:22:08.469 --> 02:22:08.479 align:start position:0%
medical subsidy I'm not sure some of you
 
02:22:11.030 --> 02:22:11.040 align:start position:0%
who have been around a few years may be
 
02:22:13.190 --> 02:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
familiar with that term this is a a
 
02:22:14.990 --> 02:22:15.000 align:start position:0%
benefit that the legislature created in
 
02:22:16.790 --> 02:22:16.800 align:start position:0%
the late 80s and early 90s for the
 
02:22:18.389 --> 02:22:18.399 align:start position:0%
different groups and have been phasing
 
02:22:21.429 --> 02:22:21.439 align:start position:0%
it out over time this is a payment
 
02:22:23.630 --> 02:22:23.640 align:start position:0%
um if if a retiree is receiving
 
02:22:26.190 --> 02:22:26.200 align:start position:0%
insurance through their former employer
 
02:22:29.110 --> 02:22:29.120 align:start position:0%
uh and HRS will pay a set amount in
 
02:22:31.790 --> 02:22:31.800 align:start position:0%
statute to offset any out- of- pocket
 
02:22:33.309 --> 02:22:33.319 align:start position:0%
premiums they're paying to the former
 
02:22:34.750 --> 02:22:34.760 align:start position:0%
employer whether it's a political
 
02:22:37.750 --> 02:22:37.760 align:start position:0%
subdivision or school or the state um
 
02:22:39.950 --> 02:22:39.960 align:start position:0%
the plan is closed to group one members
 
02:22:42.910 --> 02:22:42.920 align:start position:0%
now um group two members who were in
 
02:22:46.389 --> 02:22:46.399 align:start position:0%
service um on June 30th of 2000 and
 
02:22:47.870 --> 02:22:47.880 align:start position:0%
they're still working they'll be subsidy
 
02:22:50.469 --> 02:22:50.479 align:start position:0%
eligible when they retire as Will Group
 
02:22:53.110 --> 02:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
gr two regular current accidental
 
02:22:54.950 --> 02:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
disability retirements who were active
 
02:22:59.230 --> 02:22:59.240 align:start position:0%
before July 1 of 2005 so this you know
 
02:23:02.190 --> 02:23:02.200 align:start position:0%
and that that's a ever shrinking pool um
 
02:23:03.790 --> 02:23:03.800 align:start position:0%
you know as as we get farther away from
 
02:23:08.190 --> 02:23:08.200 align:start position:0%
those dates this uh bill would create a
 
02:23:10.750 --> 02:23:10.760 align:start position:0%
subsidy for these this category of
 
02:23:14.590 --> 02:23:14.600 align:start position:0%
disability um you know with uh for with
 
02:23:17.590 --> 02:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
a a larger monthly premium offset amount
 
02:23:20.710 --> 02:23:20.720 align:start position:0%
$1,000 per person prior to medic care
 
02:23:23.990 --> 02:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
eligibility and 630 and change after
 
02:23:25.950 --> 02:23:25.960 align:start position:0%
that that percentage is the same as the
 
02:23:28.150 --> 02:23:28.160 align:start position:0%
percentage in the current subsidy
 
02:23:30.389 --> 02:23:30.399 align:start position:0%
amounts for those who are receiving it
 
02:23:32.030 --> 02:23:32.040 align:start position:0%
but it's just a larger Base number and
 
02:23:34.670 --> 02:23:34.680 align:start position:0%
again if their if their insurance
 
02:23:36.030 --> 02:23:36.040 align:start position:0%
premiums that they were paying from
 
02:23:37.750 --> 02:23:37.760 align:start position:0%
their former employer were less than
 
02:23:39.030 --> 02:23:39.040 align:start position:0%
that they wouldn't get the extra we
 
02:23:41.190 --> 02:23:41.200 align:start position:0%
would pay up to the amount and if the
 
02:23:43.510 --> 02:23:43.520 align:start position:0%
amount was greater they'd pay pay the
 
02:23:47.030 --> 02:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
difference um so that's how the subsidy
 
02:23:49.510 --> 02:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
uh works so those those were the the
 
02:23:50.630 --> 02:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
version that came over from from the
 
02:23:54.190 --> 02:23:54.200 align:start position:0%
Senate those are the four primary um uh
 
02:23:56.389 --> 02:23:56.399 align:start position:0%
differences in the current benefit and
 
02:23:57.990 --> 02:23:58.000 align:start position:0%
in this new
 
02:24:00.990 --> 02:24:01.000 align:start position:0%
benefit that be glad to answer any other
 
02:24:03.309 --> 02:24:03.319 align:start position:0%
questions this continues to say it
 
02:24:05.950 --> 02:24:05.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't affect the sections dealing with
 
02:24:08.790 --> 02:24:08.800 align:start position:0%
working after retirement so that someone
 
02:24:10.269 --> 02:24:10.279 align:start position:0%
who were to
 
02:24:13.110 --> 02:24:13.120 align:start position:0%
be um
 
02:24:17.190 --> 02:24:17.200 align:start position:0%
retired due to due to this this
 
02:24:19.790 --> 02:24:19.800 align:start position:0%
disability would still be limited to
 
02:24:22.070 --> 02:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
part-time work if they were working for
 
02:24:25.030 --> 02:24:25.040 align:start position:0%
a retirement system employer yes yes
 
02:24:27.030 --> 02:24:27.040 align:start position:0%
that that that may be in fully worded
 
02:24:29.469 --> 02:24:29.479 align:start position:0%
there were changes to in the previous
 
02:24:31.550 --> 02:24:31.560 align:start position:0%
version about working after retirement
 
02:24:34.190 --> 02:24:34.200 align:start position:0%
and um post-retirement death benefits
 
02:24:35.630 --> 02:24:35.640 align:start position:0%
those were taken out in the version you
 
02:24:38.469 --> 02:24:38.479 align:start position:0%
received so it's status quo um for the
 
02:24:40.389 --> 02:24:40.399 align:start position:0%
working after retirement rules for the
 
02:24:42.990 --> 02:24:43.000 align:start position:0%
50% Auto espousal uh benefit for group
 
02:24:45.670 --> 02:24:45.680 align:start position:0%
two uh things like that that those those
 
02:24:47.670 --> 02:24:47.680 align:start position:0%
are unchanged for this new
 
02:24:49.910 --> 02:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
category thank you does anyone else have
 
02:24:53.469 --> 02:24:53.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:56.110 --> 02:24:56.120 align:start position:0%
Brown uh thank you madam
 
02:24:58.110 --> 02:24:58.120 align:start position:0%
chair thanks for taking my question
 
02:25:00.990 --> 02:25:01.000 align:start position:0%
early early on you mentioned both group
 
02:25:02.990 --> 02:25:03.000 align:start position:0%
one and group two but this is definitely
 
02:25:04.510 --> 02:25:04.520 align:start position:0%
only group two correct yeah this is this
 
02:25:07.070 --> 02:25:07.080 align:start position:0%
is group two only okay and this may not
 
02:25:09.830 --> 02:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
be completely relevant but there are
 
02:25:12.429 --> 02:25:12.439 align:start position:0%
people that work in group one that are
 
02:25:15.830 --> 02:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
also exposed to this type of potential
 
02:25:19.070 --> 02:25:19.080 align:start position:0%
injury inspectors of various nature um
 
02:25:20.950 --> 02:25:20.960 align:start position:0%
going sometimes you have to take law
 
02:25:24.389 --> 02:25:24.399 align:start position:0%
enforcement along so it would seem like
 
02:25:26.070 --> 02:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
it might apply to group one as well
 
02:25:28.030 --> 02:25:28.040 align:start position:0%
that's not really relevant I suppose
 
02:25:28.040 --> 02:25:29.710 align:start position:0%
that's not really relevant I suppose
thank

02:25:29.710 --> 02:25:29.720 align:start position:0%
thank
 
02:25:31.990 --> 02:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
you it depends on whether we're
 
02:25:33.550 --> 02:25:33.560 align:start position:0%
expecting somebody to come over to the
 
02:25:36.150 --> 02:25:36.160 align:start position:0%
DMV with with a pistol and and settle
 
02:25:38.389 --> 02:25:38.399 align:start position:0%
their disputes violently I wouldn't
 
02:25:40.389 --> 02:25:40.399 align:start position:0%
think it's that
 
02:25:43.670 --> 02:25:43.680 align:start position:0%
likely may I would follow up having if I
 
02:25:46.150 --> 02:25:46.160 align:start position:0%
may please
 
02:25:48.910 --> 02:25:48.920 align:start position:0%
yeah I I'm a group one retiree worked at
 
02:25:51.550 --> 02:25:51.560 align:start position:0%
Dees and there's a number of instances
 
02:25:53.990 --> 02:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
where our inspectors especially when
 
02:25:56.070 --> 02:25:56.080 align:start position:0%
you're tracking down people doing legal
 
02:25:57.870 --> 02:25:57.880 align:start position:0%
disposal on their property and that type
 
02:25:59.070 --> 02:25:59.080 align:start position:0%
of thing where you do take a law
 
02:26:01.269 --> 02:26:01.279 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer with you or
 
02:26:03.309 --> 02:26:03.319 align:start position:0%
sometimes not and and there have been
 
02:26:05.870 --> 02:26:05.880 align:start position:0%
cases of of threatening with firearms
 
02:26:07.710 --> 02:26:07.720 align:start position:0%
and that type of thing so thank you
 
02:26:10.070 --> 02:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
madam shair appreciate that yes all
 
02:26:13.510 --> 02:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
right well we I'm sure that if this
 
02:26:15.710 --> 02:26:15.720 align:start position:0%
benefit is a success group one will be
 
02:26:18.269 --> 02:26:18.279 align:start position:0%
coming after us in the
 
02:26:21.830 --> 02:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
future any other questions from Mr Mr
 
02:26:24.110 --> 02:26:24.120 align:start position:0%
car representative
 
02:26:27.710 --> 02:26:27.720 align:start position:0%
broa I apologize for coming in late so
 
02:26:30.910 --> 02:26:30.920 align:start position:0%
in the current statute it says
 
02:26:35.550 --> 02:26:35.560 align:start position:0%
that people who are disabled who have um
 
02:26:37.790 --> 02:26:37.800 align:start position:0%
additional compensation from a part-time
 
02:26:41.990 --> 02:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
position or something that is taken into
 
02:26:45.750 --> 02:26:45.760 align:start position:0%
account by the um in in their payment
 
02:26:48.389 --> 02:26:48.399 align:start position:0%
but in their annual amount earned
 
02:26:50.950 --> 02:26:50.960 align:start position:0%
whereas if House Bill 134
 
02:26:54.030 --> 02:26:54.040 align:start position:0%
passes any type of gainful occupation
 
02:26:56.870 --> 02:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
reporting would be would not be required
 
02:26:56.880 --> 02:26:58.990 align:start position:0%
reporting would be would not be required
correct

02:26:58.990 --> 02:26:59.000 align:start position:0%
correct
 
02:27:02.630 --> 02:27:02.640 align:start position:0%

I'm here today in in support of Senate
 
02:28:22.920 --> 02:28:24.950 align:start position:0%
I'm here today in in support of Senate
Bill

02:28:24.950 --> 02:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
02:28:29.070 --> 02:28:29.080 align:start position:0%
134 so the the purpose of this bill is
 
02:28:33.309 --> 02:28:33.319 align:start position:0%
to add a new section under accidental
 
02:28:36.389 --> 02:28:36.399 align:start position:0%
disability and um and the accident of
 
02:28:39.150 --> 02:28:39.160 align:start position:0%
disability retirement violent accident
 
02:28:41.269 --> 02:28:41.279 align:start position:0%
disability retirement
 
02:28:41.279 --> 02:28:43.429 align:start position:0%
disability retirement
allowance

02:28:43.429 --> 02:28:43.439 align:start position:0%
allowance
 
02:28:45.870 --> 02:28:45.880 align:start position:0%
so I have my prepared statement I'm
 
02:28:47.429 --> 02:28:47.439 align:start position:0%
going to wander off this thing now just
 
02:28:48.790 --> 02:28:48.800 align:start position:0%
listening to some of the stuff that's
 
02:28:51.469 --> 02:28:51.479 align:start position:0%
been spoken to here so my the reason why
 
02:28:54.510 --> 02:28:54.520 align:start position:0%
I got involved um obviously I'm close
 
02:28:56.349 --> 02:28:56.359 align:start position:0%
friends with the andar through my work
 
02:28:58.630 --> 02:28:58.640 align:start position:0%
with him through being his Union
 
02:29:00.910 --> 02:29:00.920 align:start position:0%
president and also just from the stuff
 
02:29:02.870 --> 02:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
that I've done with the Hampshire Police
 
02:29:05.870 --> 02:29:05.880 align:start position:0%
Association and over the course of time
 
02:29:08.349 --> 02:29:08.359 align:start position:0%
since 2012 just some of the things that
 
02:29:10.910 --> 02:29:10.920 align:start position:0%
Dan's been dealing with things that have
 
02:29:16.190 --> 02:29:16.200 align:start position:0%
come up um I just felt that um leg some
 
02:29:17.950 --> 02:29:17.960 align:start position:0%
type of legislation was needed to try to
 
02:29:19.710 --> 02:29:19.720 align:start position:0%
correct some of these things one of the
 
02:29:22.389 --> 02:29:22.399 align:start position:0%
things if you look at um there's two
 
02:29:23.910 --> 02:29:23.920 align:start position:0%
type of there's two type of uh
 
02:29:26.269 --> 02:29:26.279 align:start position:0%
disability retirements in the state one
 
02:29:28.550 --> 02:29:28.560 align:start position:0%
is accidental disability which is
 
02:29:29.750 --> 02:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
something that happens when you when
 
02:29:32.110 --> 02:29:32.120 align:start position:0%
you're working get injured and you and
 
02:29:34.030 --> 02:29:34.040 align:start position:0%
you're permanently disabled the other
 
02:29:36.550 --> 02:29:36.560 align:start position:0%
one's called Ordinary so one of the
 
02:29:38.950 --> 02:29:38.960 align:start position:0%
conversations I had with Dan probably
 
02:29:42.590 --> 02:29:42.600 align:start position:0%
half you know while into this um his his
 
02:29:45.150 --> 02:29:45.160 align:start position:0%
journey now and his disability when I
 
02:29:47.590 --> 02:29:47.600 align:start position:0%
found out that his his disability was
 
02:29:49.030 --> 02:29:49.040 align:start position:0%
called accidental
 
02:29:51.309 --> 02:29:51.319 align:start position:0%
disability my question to him was
 
02:29:53.230 --> 02:29:53.240 align:start position:0%
accidental disability well this wasn't
 
02:29:55.510 --> 02:29:55.520 align:start position:0%
an accident how is it called accidental
 
02:29:58.630 --> 02:29:58.640 align:start position:0%
disability when it's not an accident so
 
02:30:02.030 --> 02:30:02.040 align:start position:0%
the one thing is with this with this
 
02:30:02.040 --> 02:30:03.469 align:start position:0%
the one thing is with this with this
whole

02:30:03.469 --> 02:30:03.479 align:start position:0%
whole
 
02:30:06.070 --> 02:30:06.080 align:start position:0%
um what this whole bill is is dealing
 
02:30:09.630 --> 02:30:09.640 align:start position:0%
with is everything that um would be
 
02:30:10.950 --> 02:30:10.960 align:start position:0%
covered under here with these
 
02:30:13.030 --> 02:30:13.040 align:start position:0%
disabilities they're not an accident
 
02:30:14.630 --> 02:30:14.640 align:start position:0%
they're all intentional
 
02:30:18.389 --> 02:30:18.399 align:start position:0%
acts and just listening to some of the
 
02:30:23.030 --> 02:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
conversation I I feel for any employee
 
02:30:26.070 --> 02:30:26.080 align:start position:0%
um someone that's going on a gas worker
 
02:30:28.830 --> 02:30:28.840 align:start position:0%
utility person um that goes out to a
 
02:30:32.110 --> 02:30:32.120 align:start position:0%
home someplace and and gets harassed or
 
02:30:35.030 --> 02:30:35.040 align:start position:0%
maybe even gets attacked I feel for that
 
02:30:38.349 --> 02:30:38.359 align:start position:0%
person in in this scenario in these
 
02:30:40.070 --> 02:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
incidents that you're going to hear
 
02:30:41.349 --> 02:30:41.359 align:start position:0%
they're going to speak to you and
 
02:30:42.870 --> 02:30:42.880 align:start position:0%
they're going explain the scenarios that
 
02:30:45.110 --> 02:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
they were in the the incidents that they
 
02:30:45.120 --> 02:30:45.910 align:start position:0%
they were in the the incidents that they
were

02:30:45.910 --> 02:30:45.920 align:start position:0%
were
 
02:30:50.070 --> 02:30:50.080 align:start position:0%
in they were purposely attacked um they
 
02:30:52.469 --> 02:30:52.479 align:start position:0%
were targeted and attacked so it wasn't
 
02:30:54.030 --> 02:30:54.040 align:start position:0%
like they just came upon something and
 
02:30:55.990 --> 02:30:56.000 align:start position:0%
something just you know someone didn't
 
02:30:58.309 --> 02:30:58.319 align:start position:0%
like the fact that their meter was being
 
02:31:01.030 --> 02:31:01.040 align:start position:0%
read they were attacked with a specific
 
02:31:05.309 --> 02:31:05.319 align:start position:0%
intent of causing harm or killing them
 
02:31:07.590 --> 02:31:07.600 align:start position:0%
and the injuries that they sustained are
 
02:31:11.190 --> 02:31:11.200 align:start position:0%
no different than if they were in combat
 
02:31:14.429 --> 02:31:14.439 align:start position:0%
they're not clean injuries that the type
 
02:31:16.830 --> 02:31:16.840 align:start position:0%
injuries that are ever developing
 
02:31:18.389 --> 02:31:18.399 align:start position:0%
they're ever evolving they're Ever
 
02:31:21.150 --> 02:31:21.160 align:start position:0%
Changing they're not an injury that you
 
02:31:23.790 --> 02:31:23.800 align:start position:0%
have and it heals you might have a
 
02:31:26.469 --> 02:31:26.479 align:start position:0%
disability from it but say you lost a
 
02:31:30.790 --> 02:31:30.800 align:start position:0%
limb the limb is gone and you have to
 
02:31:32.389 --> 02:31:32.399 align:start position:0%
figure out how to compensate for not
 
02:31:34.950 --> 02:31:34.960 align:start position:0%
having that limb the injuries that they
 
02:31:39.070 --> 02:31:39.080 align:start position:0%
have are um I can I'll use Dan as an
 
02:31:40.670 --> 02:31:40.680 align:start position:0%
example who he'll probably come up and
 
02:31:42.269 --> 02:31:42.279 align:start position:0%
tell you some of the stuff that he has
 
02:31:44.990 --> 02:31:45.000 align:start position:0%
wrong with him but one of some of his
 
02:31:47.910 --> 02:31:47.920 align:start position:0%
injuries uh he was shot six
 
02:31:51.590 --> 02:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
times um he fell in he his left tibia
 
02:31:54.429 --> 02:31:54.439 align:start position:0%
was shattered so it caused him to fall
 
02:31:55.349 --> 02:31:55.359 align:start position:0%
on his
 
02:31:59.269 --> 02:31:59.279 align:start position:0%
back um one of the bullets that was shot
 
02:32:01.150 --> 02:32:01.160 align:start position:0%
at him went under his vest after he fell
 
02:32:03.309 --> 02:32:03.319 align:start position:0%
down so it just bounced around inside
 
02:32:06.510 --> 02:32:06.520 align:start position:0%
him because it wouldn't come out um it
 
02:32:09.230 --> 02:32:09.240 align:start position:0%
caused just a ton of internal injuries
 
02:32:12.870 --> 02:32:12.880 align:start position:0%
to his internal organs um intestines he
 
02:32:16.070 --> 02:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
lost two feet of his intestines he has
 
02:32:18.990 --> 02:32:19.000 align:start position:0%
um lead fragments in his body that they
 
02:32:20.950 --> 02:32:20.960 align:start position:0%
can't take out and the reason they can't
 
02:32:23.750 --> 02:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
take them out it's too risky so just
 
02:32:27.349 --> 02:32:27.359 align:start position:0%
think about um you buy a house right now
 
02:32:29.830 --> 02:32:29.840 align:start position:0%
and it's built before 1978 you have to
 
02:32:33.110 --> 02:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
have a lead paint test done on it why is
 
02:32:34.670 --> 02:32:34.680 align:start position:0%
that because you want to make sure
 
02:32:36.190 --> 02:32:36.200 align:start position:0%
you're not going to get poison something
 
02:32:38.550 --> 02:32:38.560 align:start position:0%
like that from the house he has lead in
 
02:32:40.830 --> 02:32:40.840 align:start position:0%
his body and what is that going to do we
 
02:32:43.190 --> 02:32:43.200 align:start position:0%
don't know what the cause what causes
 
02:32:45.190 --> 02:32:45.200 align:start position:0%
that's going to have with him going in
 
02:32:47.830 --> 02:32:47.840 align:start position:0%
the future but I'm I'm sure something's
 
02:32:50.710 --> 02:32:50.720 align:start position:0%
going to happen with that um
 
02:32:54.710 --> 02:32:54.720 align:start position:0%
um he's had um 19 major
 
02:32:57.110 --> 02:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
surgeries um so I'm just giving you an
 
02:33:00.070 --> 02:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
example like this and Paul Lewis um same
 
02:33:03.630 --> 02:33:03.640 align:start position:0%
thing he he was shot in the arm um again
 
02:33:06.070 --> 02:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
it's not a clean injury um he still
 
02:33:08.670 --> 02:33:08.680 align:start position:0%
having issues with that and it's they're
 
02:33:10.510 --> 02:33:10.520 align:start position:0%
ever developing injuries so that's part
 
02:33:12.309 --> 02:33:12.319 align:start position:0%
of the that's part of the reason why
 
02:33:13.429 --> 02:33:13.439 align:start position:0%
this bill is
 
02:33:16.750 --> 02:33:16.760 align:start position:0%
important um so and know kind of over
 
02:33:18.190 --> 02:33:18.200 align:start position:0%
the all over the place because I'm just
 
02:33:19.230 --> 02:33:19.240 align:start position:0%
trying to answer some of the stuff that
 
02:33:22.269 --> 02:33:22.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:24.550 --> 02:33:24.560 align:start position:0%
one of the things with these two offices
 
02:33:26.070 --> 02:33:26.080 align:start position:0%
is the time that they had on when this
 
02:33:28.990 --> 02:33:29.000 align:start position:0%
took place so Dan had three years and
 
02:33:31.110 --> 02:33:31.120 align:start position:0%
nine months on when his incident took
 
02:33:32.990 --> 02:33:33.000 align:start position:0%
place so when we started our journey
 
02:33:35.269 --> 02:33:35.279 align:start position:0%
with this with this bill uh we actually
 
02:33:37.990 --> 02:33:38.000 align:start position:0%
started back in 2019 is when we started
 
02:33:39.750 --> 02:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
trying to put this together our
 
02:33:42.630 --> 02:33:42.640 align:start position:0%
conversation started way before that to
 
02:33:44.269 --> 02:33:44.279 align:start position:0%
get me motivated to actually start
 
02:33:46.190 --> 02:33:46.200 align:start position:0%
putting the spill together that's you
 
02:33:48.710 --> 02:33:48.720 align:start position:0%
know kind of looking at the time frame
 
02:33:50.590 --> 02:33:50.600 align:start position:0%
um so when we were putting this together
 
02:33:52.710 --> 02:33:52.720 align:start position:0%
and I'm looking at what his pension was
 
02:33:55.590 --> 02:33:55.600 align:start position:0%
what they came out with his pension
 
02:33:59.630 --> 02:33:59.640 align:start position:0%
um so the way the pension works it's the
 
02:34:01.309 --> 02:34:01.319 align:start position:0%
average for a disability it's the
 
02:34:03.590 --> 02:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
average of your five highest years so
 
02:34:06.190 --> 02:34:06.200 align:start position:0%
we'll take Dan's example right now he
 
02:34:08.630 --> 02:34:08.640 align:start position:0%
had three three years and nine months on
 
02:34:11.910 --> 02:34:11.920 align:start position:0%
when his incident took place so to start
 
02:34:14.750 --> 02:34:14.760 align:start position:0%
off with your you your first years are
 
02:34:18.269 --> 02:34:18.279 align:start position:0%
generally your lowest years so Dan
 
02:34:20.990 --> 02:34:21.000 align:start position:0%
actually um he tried coming back to work
 
02:34:22.990 --> 02:34:23.000 align:start position:0%
he did he came back for seven years put
 
02:34:25.349 --> 02:34:25.359 align:start position:0%
seven more years in during those seven
 
02:34:28.750 --> 02:34:28.760 align:start position:0%
years like I said he had like 19 from
 
02:34:31.230 --> 02:34:31.240 align:start position:0%
the beginning of his incident to when he
 
02:34:33.150 --> 02:34:33.160 align:start position:0%
finished work and he had about 19 uh
 
02:34:33.160 --> 02:34:34.670 align:start position:0%
finished work and he had about 19 uh
major

02:34:34.670 --> 02:34:34.680 align:start position:0%
major
 
02:34:36.790 --> 02:34:36.800 align:start position:0%
surgeries during those
 
02:34:39.750 --> 02:34:39.760 align:start position:0%
surgeries um he's out he's out of work
 
02:34:43.110 --> 02:34:43.120 align:start position:0%
so when he's out of work um it's called
 
02:34:45.389 --> 02:34:45.399 align:start position:0%
it's work is comp the way work as comp
 
02:34:48.030 --> 02:34:48.040 align:start position:0%
works if you get hurt injured um and
 
02:34:49.429 --> 02:34:49.439 align:start position:0%
you're going to be out of work it starts
 
02:34:51.870 --> 02:34:51.880 align:start position:0%
off is sick time so we usually have
 
02:34:53.309 --> 02:34:53.319 align:start position:0%
about three days of sick time it gives
 
02:34:54.870 --> 02:34:54.880 align:start position:0%
Administration some time to get your
 
02:34:56.469 --> 02:34:56.479 align:start position:0%
paperwork together to convert the sick
 
02:34:59.190 --> 02:34:59.200 align:start position:0%
time to work as calm time and then that
 
02:35:01.710 --> 02:35:01.720 align:start position:0%
sick time eventually converts to work as
 
02:35:05.990 --> 02:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
calm time so one of Dan's goals was he
 
02:35:08.950 --> 02:35:08.960 align:start position:0%
wanted to make 10 years so
 
02:35:10.630 --> 02:35:10.640 align:start position:0%
psychologically however you want to look
 
02:35:13.990 --> 02:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
at it he had a goal to make 10 years so
 
02:35:17.670 --> 02:35:17.680 align:start position:0%
he thought he had over 10 years in I
 
02:35:19.389 --> 02:35:19.399 align:start position:0%
think it was 10 years and 7 months 10
 
02:35:21.910 --> 02:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
years in 9 months he went up to the
 
02:35:23.790 --> 02:35:23.800 align:start position:0%
retirement and that's what he thought
 
02:35:26.550 --> 02:35:26.560 align:start position:0%
his number was when they ran his number
 
02:35:28.110 --> 02:35:28.120 align:start position:0%
they told him he had just over nine
 
02:35:30.870 --> 02:35:30.880 align:start position:0%
years so he told him you need to go back
 
02:35:32.950 --> 02:35:32.960 align:start position:0%
and recalculate that because that's not
 
02:35:35.990 --> 02:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
what it is so they told him that the
 
02:35:38.910 --> 02:35:38.920 align:start position:0%
time that you're out on work is calm is
 
02:35:41.349 --> 02:35:41.359 align:start position:0%
not considered credible service
 
02:35:44.590 --> 02:35:44.600 align:start position:0%
time so now think about that for a
 
02:35:47.990 --> 02:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
minute the day the night he gets
 
02:35:50.429 --> 02:35:50.439 align:start position:0%
shot that's a work day he's clearly
 
02:35:52.110 --> 02:35:52.120 align:start position:0%
working so it's going to count as a work
 
02:35:54.750 --> 02:35:54.760 align:start position:0%
day he's fighting for his life that
 
02:35:57.150 --> 02:35:57.160 align:start position:0%
night next day he's still fighting for
 
02:35:58.510 --> 02:35:58.520 align:start position:0%
his life the doctors don't know how he
 
02:36:01.110 --> 02:36:01.120 align:start position:0%
lived the amount of blood that he lost
 
02:36:03.150 --> 02:36:03.160 align:start position:0%
um it was incredible that his organs
 
02:36:06.030 --> 02:36:06.040 align:start position:0%
didn't shut down um so the next day he's
 
02:36:08.070 --> 02:36:08.080 align:start position:0%
clearly still fighting for his life
 
02:36:10.070 --> 02:36:10.080 align:start position:0%
that's a sick day that sick day turned
 
02:36:13.710 --> 02:36:13.720 align:start position:0%
into a work as comp day which then turns
 
02:36:16.510 --> 02:36:16.520 align:start position:0%
into a non-credible service day so he's
 
02:36:18.870 --> 02:36:18.880 align:start position:0%
being told that those days that he's
 
02:36:20.790 --> 02:36:20.800 align:start position:0%
fighting for his life life are not
 
02:36:24.070 --> 02:36:24.080 align:start position:0%
considered Federal service time so
 
02:36:27.230 --> 02:36:27.240 align:start position:0%
psychologically how do you take that um
 
02:36:28.990 --> 02:36:29.000 align:start position:0%
these are all things that fall into play
 
02:36:31.870 --> 02:36:31.880 align:start position:0%
with this type of incident and injuries
 
02:36:34.790 --> 02:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
and disability that these two officers
 
02:36:36.830 --> 02:36:36.840 align:start position:0%
are dealing with and anyone else that
 
02:36:38.429 --> 02:36:38.439 align:start position:0%
falls behind
 
02:36:38.439 --> 02:36:40.150 align:start position:0%
falls behind
them

02:36:40.150 --> 02:36:40.160 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:36:43.590 --> 02:36:43.600 align:start position:0%
so when they start calculating his time
 
02:36:46.670 --> 02:36:46.680 align:start position:0%
even though he had um like I said over
 
02:36:49.070 --> 02:36:49.080 align:start position:0%
10 years in the system when they started
 
02:36:51.510 --> 02:36:51.520 align:start position:0%
calculating in his time they could only
 
02:36:55.110 --> 02:36:55.120 align:start position:0%
come up with 4 and A2 years of actual
 
02:36:57.269 --> 02:36:57.279 align:start position:0%
time because of the amount of time that
 
02:36:59.790 --> 02:36:59.800 align:start position:0%
he missed on his surgeries so they had
 
02:37:01.670 --> 02:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
to make up a half a year I don't know
 
02:37:03.469 --> 02:37:03.479 align:start position:0%
how you factor that half a year to get
 
02:37:06.110 --> 02:37:06.120 align:start position:0%
your your number to do your multiplier
 
02:37:07.710 --> 02:37:07.720 align:start position:0%
but I know three and a half of those
 
02:37:11.950 --> 02:37:11.960 align:start position:0%
years were his lowest would historically
 
02:37:14.710 --> 02:37:14.720 align:start position:0%
would be his lowest time now you add in
 
02:37:16.790 --> 02:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
the rest to make up your five years
 
02:37:19.150 --> 02:37:19.160 align:start position:0%
what's the pension going to be and now
 
02:37:20.830 --> 02:37:20.840 align:start position:0%
at that time he wasn't married he was
 
02:37:23.150 --> 02:37:23.160 align:start position:0%
young um he's still obviously younger
 
02:37:25.469 --> 02:37:25.479 align:start position:0%
than me he's still young um but he's
 
02:37:28.190 --> 02:37:28.200 align:start position:0%
looking at a future where um you know
 
02:37:30.830 --> 02:37:30.840 align:start position:0%
clearly he has a lot of medical stuff if
 
02:37:32.349 --> 02:37:32.359 align:start position:0%
you look at him he might look like
 
02:37:33.710 --> 02:37:33.720 align:start position:0%
there's nothing wrong with him
 
02:37:35.990 --> 02:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
internally there's a lot wrong with
 
02:37:39.990 --> 02:37:40.000 align:start position:0%
him just over a year ago he had um a
 
02:37:42.030 --> 02:37:42.040 align:start position:0%
surgery where he had a blockage in his
 
02:37:44.150 --> 02:37:44.160 align:start position:0%
intestines he'll you know he'll tell you
 
02:37:46.990 --> 02:37:47.000 align:start position:0%
the stuff but he had blocket in his
 
02:37:49.030 --> 02:37:49.040 align:start position:0%
intestines if you don't have an issue
 
02:37:50.550 --> 02:37:50.560 align:start position:0%
with your intestines normally the
 
02:37:52.269 --> 02:37:52.279 align:start position:0%
doctor's going to go in there and
 
02:37:53.630 --> 02:37:53.640 align:start position:0%
they're going to do some surgery they're
 
02:37:54.790 --> 02:37:54.800 align:start position:0%
going to they're going to unblock it
 
02:37:56.630 --> 02:37:56.640 align:start position:0%
there was a very high risk of him going
 
02:37:58.309 --> 02:37:58.319 align:start position:0%
septic obviously you don't want to have
 
02:38:00.670 --> 02:38:00.680 align:start position:0%
that you you'll die from that in his
 
02:38:02.670 --> 02:38:02.680 align:start position:0%
situation because of the scar tissue and
 
02:38:04.429 --> 02:38:04.439 align:start position:0%
with the amount of um intestines that he
 
02:38:07.070 --> 02:38:07.080 align:start position:0%
had lost any surgery that he has on his
 
02:38:09.630 --> 02:38:09.640 align:start position:0%
intestines there's a risk that they
 
02:38:11.710 --> 02:38:11.720 align:start position:0%
won't have enough to reattach it and now
 
02:38:14.309 --> 02:38:14.319 align:start position:0%
he'll have a colomy bag um eventually at
 
02:38:15.349 --> 02:38:15.359 align:start position:0%
some point that's probably going to
 
02:38:17.670 --> 02:38:17.680 align:start position:0%
happen with him but they don't want to
 
02:38:19.150 --> 02:38:19.160 align:start position:0%
they want to try to push that off as far
 
02:38:22.110 --> 02:38:22.120 align:start position:0%
as they can can so again these are just
 
02:38:23.309 --> 02:38:23.319 align:start position:0%
some of the things that they're dealing
 
02:38:23.319 --> 02:38:24.309 align:start position:0%
some of the things that they're dealing
with

02:38:24.309 --> 02:38:24.319 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:38:27.110 --> 02:38:27.120 align:start position:0%
um so when they factor out his you know
 
02:38:29.710 --> 02:38:29.720 align:start position:0%
obviously his his his pension he he's
 
02:38:33.070 --> 02:38:33.080 align:start position:0%
got this fiveyear pension and um again
 
02:38:35.070 --> 02:38:35.080 align:start position:0%
it's historic the low historically it's
 
02:38:37.510 --> 02:38:37.520 align:start position:0%
the lowest time I had said to Dan at
 
02:38:38.630 --> 02:38:38.640 align:start position:0%
that when we were going through this
 
02:38:39.790 --> 02:38:39.800 align:start position:0%
stuff can you imagine if someone had
 
02:38:42.429 --> 02:38:42.439 align:start position:0%
less time on than you I mean your
 
02:38:43.830 --> 02:38:43.840 align:start position:0%
Situation's bad enough but I can't
 
02:38:45.190 --> 02:38:45.200 align:start position:0%
imagine someone have less time on than
 
02:38:48.710 --> 02:38:48.720 align:start position:0%
you and then Paul Lewis comes along
 
02:38:51.630 --> 02:38:51.640 align:start position:0%
eight months in the the job 8 months on
 
02:38:53.269 --> 02:38:53.279 align:start position:0%
the job when his incident
 
02:38:56.349 --> 02:38:56.359 align:start position:0%
happened how do you how do you factor
 
02:38:58.990 --> 02:38:59.000 align:start position:0%
5ye average when you only worked eight
 
02:39:00.950 --> 02:39:00.960 align:start position:0%
months not eight years eight months on
 
02:39:03.070 --> 02:39:03.080 align:start position:0%
the job eight
 
02:39:05.790 --> 02:39:05.800 align:start position:0%
months how do you come up with a pension
 
02:39:07.030 --> 02:39:07.040 align:start position:0%
that is going to he's going to be able
 
02:39:10.110 --> 02:39:10.120 align:start position:0%
to survive on um for the you know
 
02:39:13.670 --> 02:39:13.680 align:start position:0%
basically for the rest of his life um so
 
02:39:18.710 --> 02:39:18.720 align:start position:0%
that's why this tension was put together
 
02:39:22.309 --> 02:39:22.319 align:start position:0%
um as far as like the gainful occupation
 
02:39:25.349 --> 02:39:25.359 align:start position:0%
so at one point that gainful occupation
 
02:39:28.429 --> 02:39:28.439 align:start position:0%
wasn't in play with this it happened in
 
02:39:31.349 --> 02:39:31.359 align:start position:0%
2012 um I understand probably reason for
 
02:39:33.550 --> 02:39:33.560 align:start position:0%
it um you could have someone slip and
 
02:39:35.510 --> 02:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
fall these incidents are not a slip and
 
02:39:38.830 --> 02:39:38.840 align:start position:0%
fall they didn't ask for it they had no
 
02:39:40.349 --> 02:39:40.359 align:start position:0%
involvement at all in the injuries that
 
02:39:44.349 --> 02:39:44.359 align:start position:0%
they had um potentially someone with a
 
02:39:47.670 --> 02:39:47.680 align:start position:0%
slip and fall I mean are they hurt could
 
02:39:50.349 --> 02:39:50.359 align:start position:0%
someone claim that they had injury and
 
02:39:51.630 --> 02:39:51.640 align:start position:0%
now they're going out working another
 
02:39:54.349 --> 02:39:54.359 align:start position:0%
job and they're double dipping so that
 
02:39:56.269 --> 02:39:56.279 align:start position:0%
was put that was I'm assuming putting
 
02:39:58.990 --> 02:39:59.000 align:start position:0%
play because they want to avoid that
 
02:40:00.150 --> 02:40:00.160 align:start position:0%
potentially from
 
02:40:02.590 --> 02:40:02.600 align:start position:0%
happening this here is not something
 
02:40:05.590 --> 02:40:05.600 align:start position:0%
they asked for they want to they if they
 
02:40:06.870 --> 02:40:06.880 align:start position:0%
had their way right now they'd be back
 
02:40:08.309 --> 02:40:08.319 align:start position:0%
out in the street working as a police
 
02:40:10.750 --> 02:40:10.760 align:start position:0%
officer and you look at you look at our
 
02:40:13.150 --> 02:40:13.160 align:start position:0%
society right now it's very hard to find
 
02:40:15.429 --> 02:40:15.439 align:start position:0%
police officers it's very hard to find
 
02:40:17.030 --> 02:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
them they actually want to go out and
 
02:40:19.870 --> 02:40:19.880 align:start position:0%
work Dan actually um
 
02:40:21.070 --> 02:40:21.080 align:start position:0%
tried going
 
02:40:23.230 --> 02:40:23.240 align:start position:0%
back over a year ago he actually passed
 
02:40:26.070 --> 02:40:26.080 align:start position:0%
a PT test which was pretty heroic of him
 
02:40:28.190 --> 02:40:28.200 align:start position:0%
doing that he paid for it though because
 
02:40:30.790 --> 02:40:30.800 align:start position:0%
he couldn't walk for two weeks but um
 
02:40:33.150 --> 02:40:33.160 align:start position:0%
it's just impossible for them to do that
 
02:40:35.349 --> 02:40:35.359 align:start position:0%
they had careers taken away from them
 
02:40:38.630 --> 02:40:38.640 align:start position:0%
their lives were put on hold financially
 
02:40:41.110 --> 02:40:41.120 align:start position:0%
um like I said they have these ever
 
02:40:44.190 --> 02:40:44.200 align:start position:0%
developing um injuries some of the stuff
 
02:40:45.630 --> 02:40:45.640 align:start position:0%
that they'll have that they'll put
 
02:40:48.950 --> 02:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
claims in for um like I said Dan had
 
02:40:48.960 --> 02:40:50.070 align:start position:0%
claims in for um like I said Dan had
that

02:40:50.070 --> 02:40:50.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:40:53.750 --> 02:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
um he had a titanium rod put in his left
 
02:40:56.469 --> 02:40:56.479 align:start position:0%
leg uh one of one of the surgery he had
 
02:40:58.429 --> 02:40:58.439 align:start position:0%
uh the bone was growing too much over
 
02:41:00.269 --> 02:41:00.279 align:start position:0%
over the titanium rod they had to remove
 
02:41:01.950 --> 02:41:01.960 align:start position:0%
it because it was causing stress between
 
02:41:03.710 --> 02:41:03.720 align:start position:0%
his knee and his
 
02:41:06.030 --> 02:41:06.040 align:start position:0%
ankle they had to use a violent tool to
 
02:41:10.190 --> 02:41:10.200 align:start position:0%
pull that out he also Lo um his iliac
 
02:41:12.550 --> 02:41:12.560 align:start position:0%
artery was uh ruptured they had to
 
02:41:14.070 --> 02:41:14.080 align:start position:0%
remove that so he doesn't have iliac
 
02:41:16.030 --> 02:41:16.040 align:start position:0%
artery in his left leg that's used for
 
02:41:18.750 --> 02:41:18.760 align:start position:0%
blood circulation so he has a rod taken
 
02:41:21.349 --> 02:41:21.359 align:start position:0%
out covered under workers comp I think
 
02:41:22.590 --> 02:41:22.600 align:start position:0%
it was about a week later he had to go
 
02:41:24.630 --> 02:41:24.640 align:start position:0%
back in for procedure to check to make
 
02:41:26.790 --> 02:41:26.800 align:start position:0%
sure of the circulation because high
 
02:41:28.110 --> 02:41:28.120 align:start position:0%
risk for blood clotting because he
 
02:41:29.150 --> 02:41:29.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't have that
 
02:41:32.510 --> 02:41:32.520 align:start position:0%
artery that surgery wasn't covered
 
02:41:35.510 --> 02:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
initially because they said it wasn't
 
02:41:38.590 --> 02:41:38.600 align:start position:0%
related to the initial incident how is
 
02:41:40.190 --> 02:41:40.200 align:start position:0%
it not related to the initial incident
 
02:41:42.030 --> 02:41:42.040 align:start position:0%
he doesn't have the artery now he has to
 
02:41:43.910 --> 02:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
go fight that and this is a constant
 
02:41:46.469 --> 02:41:46.479 align:start position:0%
thing that was happening with him um so
 
02:41:48.910 --> 02:41:48.920 align:start position:0%
that's just an example but the reason
 
02:41:51.910 --> 02:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
why this this bill is important um again
 
02:41:53.150 --> 02:41:53.160 align:start position:0%
is because of these things that they're
 
02:41:54.349 --> 02:41:54.359 align:start position:0%
dealing with the injuries are not the
 
02:41:57.190 --> 02:41:57.200 align:start position:0%
same the gainful occupation it's not so
 
02:41:58.349 --> 02:41:58.359 align:start position:0%
much that they want to be able to go out
 
02:42:00.550 --> 02:42:00.560 align:start position:0%
and work a 40-hour week job they want to
 
02:42:03.550 --> 02:42:03.560 align:start position:0%
feel like a whole person um their life
 
02:42:05.230 --> 02:42:05.240 align:start position:0%
was taken away from them they want to
 
02:42:08.790 --> 02:42:08.800 align:start position:0%
feel like they have psychologically that
 
02:42:12.590 --> 02:42:12.600 align:start position:0%
they that they have a purpose um you
 
02:42:14.990 --> 02:42:15.000 align:start position:0%
know they they have families you know
 
02:42:17.190 --> 02:42:17.200 align:start position:0%
and they want to be able to say that um
 
02:42:19.230 --> 02:42:19.240 align:start position:0%
you know they they can be productive or
 
02:42:20.870 --> 02:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
or they're not being held back they're
 
02:42:22.590 --> 02:42:22.600 align:start position:0%
getting their life back now whether they
 
02:42:24.230 --> 02:42:24.240 align:start position:0%
can actually work a 40-hour week job or
 
02:42:26.469 --> 02:42:26.479 align:start position:0%
not that's irrelevant the fact that
 
02:42:28.950 --> 02:42:28.960 align:start position:0%
someone's not telling them that they
 
02:42:31.230 --> 02:42:31.240 align:start position:0%
don't that they can't do that so that
 
02:42:33.070 --> 02:42:33.080 align:start position:0%
it's a psychological part it's not
 
02:42:34.950 --> 02:42:34.960 align:start position:0%
because they want to go out and say I
 
02:42:36.550 --> 02:42:36.560 align:start position:0%
want I want to get rid of the gainful
 
02:42:38.070 --> 02:42:38.080 align:start position:0%
occupation because I want to be able to
 
02:42:39.469 --> 02:42:39.479 align:start position:0%
go work another job so I can make a lot
 
02:42:40.990 --> 02:42:41.000 align:start position:0%
of money that's not really the reason
 
02:42:43.830 --> 02:42:43.840 align:start position:0%
for it in this case it's a psychological
 
02:42:46.830 --> 02:42:46.840 align:start position:0%
reason why they want to have it and
 
02:42:49.670 --> 02:42:49.680 align:start position:0%
again it's not the injuries AR anything
 
02:42:51.790 --> 02:42:51.800 align:start position:0%
that they had any part in someone else
 
02:42:54.710 --> 02:42:54.720 align:start position:0%
did did this to them it should not apply
 
02:42:56.510 --> 02:42:56.520 align:start position:0%
to them
 
02:42:59.790 --> 02:42:59.800 align:start position:0%
so I like I said I I handed out my my um
 
02:43:01.870 --> 02:43:01.880 align:start position:0%
prepared statement I can go back to the
 
02:43:03.750 --> 02:43:03.760 align:start position:0%
thing I skipped over some stuff you're
 
02:43:06.190 --> 02:43:06.200 align:start position:0%
more than welcome to read it um I'll
 
02:43:07.870 --> 02:43:07.880 align:start position:0%
take questions if you want it but uh I
 
02:43:09.950 --> 02:43:09.960 align:start position:0%
just ask you support in this
 
02:43:13.230 --> 02:43:13.240 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you representative
 
02:43:17.389 --> 02:43:17.399 align:start position:0%
Shu thank you madam chair um I've had
 
02:43:21.950 --> 02:43:21.960 align:start position:0%
the honor to meet offic Doty and um was
 
02:43:25.269 --> 02:43:25.279 align:start position:0%
well aware of his literally miraculous
 
02:43:27.750 --> 02:43:27.760 align:start position:0%
survival and attempts to return to work
 
02:43:30.750 --> 02:43:30.760 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the update on how he's
 
02:43:34.710 --> 02:43:34.720 align:start position:0%
fairing now I'm curious um with the look
 
02:43:37.030 --> 02:43:37.040 align:start position:0%
back in this bill to
 
02:43:39.790 --> 02:43:39.800 align:start position:0%
2018 would both of these officers be
 
02:43:42.349 --> 02:43:42.359 align:start position:0%
included in that that was the reason for
 
02:43:44.710 --> 02:43:44.720 align:start position:0%
that and as far as
 
02:43:46.990 --> 02:43:47.000 align:start position:0%
um I don't know the number of people
 
02:43:49.150 --> 02:43:49.160 align:start position:0%
that would be qualified under this
 
02:43:52.710 --> 02:43:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:54.670 --> 02:43:54.680 align:start position:0%
of thank
 
02:44:00.790 --> 02:44:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:05.750 --> 02:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:08.230 --> 02:44:08.240 align:start position:0%
okay I suppose we should hear from Don
 
02:44:24.070 --> 02:44:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:32.070 --> 02:44:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:34.510 --> 02:44:34.520 align:start position:0%
share good afternoon uh thank you for
 
02:44:36.349 --> 02:44:36.359 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to speak in in front of
 
02:44:38.550 --> 02:44:38.560 align:start position:0%
you folks
 
02:44:42.830 --> 02:44:42.840 align:start position:0%
um I had a script that I'm certainly
 
02:44:45.910 --> 02:44:45.920 align:start position:0%
gonna deviate from
 
02:44:50.309 --> 02:44:50.319 align:start position:0%
um so back in 2012 uh as a Manchester
 
02:44:53.269 --> 02:44:53.279 align:start position:0%
police officer uh I was shot six times
 
02:44:55.309 --> 02:44:55.319 align:start position:0%
assisting uh other
 
02:44:57.870 --> 02:44:57.880 align:start position:0%
officers who observed the violent career
 
02:45:02.150 --> 02:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
criminal um involved in an alocation uh
 
02:45:04.110 --> 02:45:04.120 align:start position:0%
remove himself from a vehicle with what
 
02:45:06.150 --> 02:45:06.160 align:start position:0%
appeared to be a gun under his shirt in
 
02:45:06.160 --> 02:45:07.150 align:start position:0%
appeared to be a gun under his shirt in
his

02:45:07.150 --> 02:45:07.160 align:start position:0%
his
 
02:45:09.910 --> 02:45:09.920 align:start position:0%
waistband um I was on a swap that day I
 
02:45:12.070 --> 02:45:12.080 align:start position:0%
wasn't supposed to be working um I was
 
02:45:13.389 --> 02:45:13.399 align:start position:0%
actually going on vacation trying to
 
02:45:16.309 --> 02:45:16.319 align:start position:0%
work some days off and I wasn't
 
02:45:17.710 --> 02:45:17.720 align:start position:0%
certainly wasn't supposed to be on the
 
02:45:20.030 --> 02:45:20.040 align:start position:0%
west side of manchest
 
02:45:22.950 --> 02:45:22.960 align:start position:0%
um I was close by to the Grand Street
 
02:45:25.710 --> 02:45:25.720 align:start position:0%
bridge I jumped over and I helped locate
 
02:45:25.720 --> 02:45:26.710 align:start position:0%
bridge I jumped over and I helped locate
the

02:45:26.710 --> 02:45:26.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:45:30.870 --> 02:45:30.880 align:start position:0%
individual upon doing that he um fled on
 
02:45:33.269 --> 02:45:33.279 align:start position:0%
foot uh through one
 
02:45:39.269 --> 02:45:39.279 align:start position:0%
firearm and uh a foot pursuit ensued um
 
02:45:42.309 --> 02:45:42.319 align:start position:0%
eventually I was able to catch up to him
 
02:45:44.830 --> 02:45:44.840 align:start position:0%
and uh once I closed the Gap he removed
 
02:45:46.910 --> 02:45:46.920 align:start position:0%
the second firearm from his waistband
 
02:45:49.349 --> 02:45:49.359 align:start position:0%
and shot 15 rounds at me six of which
 
02:45:52.990 --> 02:45:53.000 align:start position:0%
struck me in my lead my uh leg groin
 
02:45:55.510 --> 02:45:55.520 align:start position:0%
face hand and uh
 
02:45:58.710 --> 02:45:58.720 align:start position:0%
abdomen and uh luckily I was behind the
 
02:46:00.070 --> 02:46:00.080 align:start position:0%
greatest Hospital in the world at least
 
02:46:01.750 --> 02:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
in my opinion because they saved my life
 
02:46:04.590 --> 02:46:04.600 align:start position:0%
the the Catholic Medical Center and I am
 
02:46:07.389 --> 02:46:07.399 align:start position:0%
here today because of the folks there um
 
02:46:09.230 --> 02:46:09.240 align:start position:0%
I went through 18 units of blood the
 
02:46:12.670 --> 02:46:12.680 align:start position:0%
body holds approximately nine um and
 
02:46:15.990 --> 02:46:16.000 align:start position:0%
somehow um some way I
 
02:46:19.510 --> 02:46:19.520 align:start position:0%
survived and the detail details can go
 
02:46:23.230 --> 02:46:23.240 align:start position:0%
on forever about the story um but I'm
 
02:46:24.910 --> 02:46:24.920 align:start position:0%
not necessarily here to bore you with
 
02:46:27.990 --> 02:46:28.000 align:start position:0%
those details um I'm here
 
02:46:31.429 --> 02:46:31.439 align:start position:0%
to um explain to you the cause in which
 
02:46:37.990 --> 02:46:38.000 align:start position:0%
I firmly believe in um in 2019 I'm sorry
 
02:46:39.309 --> 02:46:39.319 align:start position:0%
at the end of
 
02:46:43.269 --> 02:46:43.279 align:start position:0%
2018 after 19 surgeries I had to retire
 
02:46:45.790 --> 02:46:45.800 align:start position:0%
um I didn't want to but I kept having
 
02:46:47.269 --> 02:46:47.279 align:start position:0%
surgery after surgery after surgery
 
02:46:49.830 --> 02:46:49.840 align:start position:0%
after surgery to help continue being a
 
02:46:52.070 --> 02:46:52.080 align:start position:0%
police officer to make sure that I'm
 
02:46:55.309 --> 02:46:55.319 align:start position:0%
physically able to and it came to a
 
02:46:57.510 --> 02:46:57.520 align:start position:0%
point where I was no longer able to do
 
02:47:00.670 --> 02:47:00.680 align:start position:0%
that and it was very hard but I had to
 
02:47:03.550 --> 02:47:03.560 align:start position:0%
and I retired and it was at that point
 
02:47:08.309 --> 02:47:08.319 align:start position:0%
where I took um Ken chamelin off to the
 
02:47:10.630 --> 02:47:10.640 align:start position:0%
side and I said we need to fix the
 
02:47:14.150 --> 02:47:14.160 align:start position:0%
retirement system uh for people in my
 
02:47:16.870 --> 02:47:16.880 align:start position:0%
position um we need to create a benefit
 
02:47:19.790 --> 02:47:19.800 align:start position:0%
that's focused more towards um um a
 
02:47:22.030 --> 02:47:22.040 align:start position:0%
violent attack rather than an accident
 
02:47:23.830 --> 02:47:23.840 align:start position:0%
and I can assure you that there was
 
02:47:26.550 --> 02:47:26.560 align:start position:0%
nothing accidental about the person who
 
02:47:30.990 --> 02:47:31.000 align:start position:0%
tried to kill me um and when I was
 
02:47:33.990 --> 02:47:34.000 align:start position:0%
laying in my hospital bed um I was very
 
02:47:35.349 --> 02:47:35.359 align:start position:0%
fortunate at the time that I wasn't
 
02:47:38.389 --> 02:47:38.399 align:start position:0%
married um I didn't have children but I
 
02:47:41.309 --> 02:47:41.319 align:start position:0%
can only imagine how much more of a
 
02:47:44.070 --> 02:47:44.080 align:start position:0%
burden that recovery would be had I been
 
02:47:46.950 --> 02:47:46.960 align:start position:0%
married had a CH had children because
 
02:47:48.990 --> 02:47:49.000 align:start position:0%
laying in that bed wondering how I'm
 
02:47:50.750 --> 02:47:50.760 align:start position:0%
going to if I wasn't able to return to
 
02:47:52.469 --> 02:47:52.479 align:start position:0%
work how was I going to be able to
 
02:47:54.429 --> 02:47:54.439 align:start position:0%
provide um how was I going to have
 
02:47:57.429 --> 02:47:57.439 align:start position:0%
health insurance um what what was I
 
02:48:01.150 --> 02:48:01.160 align:start position:0%
gonna do and this bill here uh
 
02:48:03.990 --> 02:48:04.000 align:start position:0%
specifically touches upon I think what
 
02:48:08.070 --> 02:48:08.080 align:start position:0%
is uh three of the most important
 
02:48:13.150 --> 02:48:13.160 align:start position:0%
um fault is a bad word but but um um
 
02:48:15.550 --> 02:48:15.560 align:start position:0%
things that that that should be changed
 
02:48:17.870 --> 02:48:17.880 align:start position:0%
for people in my position and that's
 
02:48:21.630 --> 02:48:21.640 align:start position:0%
your your really benefit um the
 
02:48:25.110 --> 02:48:25.120 align:start position:0%
healthare and the gainful occupation so
 
02:48:28.910 --> 02:48:28.920 align:start position:0%
the $75,000 a year that would increase
 
02:48:31.429 --> 02:48:31.439 align:start position:0%
for me specifically um my my benefit
 
02:48:32.750 --> 02:48:32.760 align:start position:0%
each year is
 
02:48:35.630 --> 02:48:35.640 align:start position:0%
$46,000 so if this piece of legislation
 
02:48:37.190 --> 02:48:37.200 align:start position:0%
were to go through it would go from
 
02:48:39.790 --> 02:48:39.800 align:start position:0%
$46,000 to
 
02:48:43.710 --> 02:48:43.720 align:start position:0%
$75,000 and uh with that being said is
 
02:48:45.429 --> 02:48:45.439 align:start position:0%
someone I know recently he heard his
 
02:48:48.150 --> 02:48:48.160 align:start position:0%
back on the job and he went out on
 
02:48:50.550 --> 02:48:50.560 align:start position:0%
accidental disability the same
 
02:48:53.309 --> 02:48:53.319 align:start position:0%
accidental disability that I receive his
 
02:48:58.269 --> 02:48:58.279 align:start position:0%
pension is uh nearly triple mine and um
 
02:49:01.110 --> 02:49:01.120 align:start position:0%
that is another reason why I feel that
 
02:49:04.469 --> 02:49:04.479 align:start position:0%
that basing it off of a high fiveyear
 
02:49:06.710 --> 02:49:06.720 align:start position:0%
average where most young cops don't have
 
02:49:08.190 --> 02:49:08.200 align:start position:0%
that because most young cops are the
 
02:49:10.389 --> 02:49:10.399 align:start position:0%
ones out in the street responding to the
 
02:49:12.510 --> 02:49:12.520 align:start position:0%
most dangerous of situations because as
 
02:49:14.510 --> 02:49:14.520 align:start position:0%
you go on in your career you're usually
 
02:49:15.710 --> 02:49:15.720 align:start position:0%
off the
 
02:49:18.150 --> 02:49:18.160 align:start position:0%
street um and then the the the
 
02:49:20.950 --> 02:49:20.960 align:start position:0%
healthcare subsidy um I felt that that
 
02:49:23.790 --> 02:49:23.800 align:start position:0%
was important and in fact originally
 
02:49:25.469 --> 02:49:25.479 align:start position:0%
that wasn't even a thought of mine to
 
02:49:27.910 --> 02:49:27.920 align:start position:0%
even include this but um some some
 
02:49:31.229 --> 02:49:31.239 align:start position:0%
Senators s suggested that we do that um
 
02:49:34.710 --> 02:49:34.720 align:start position:0%
and here it is it's in there um and I
 
02:49:36.870 --> 02:49:36.880 align:start position:0%
thank them for that and then the gainful
 
02:49:39.150 --> 02:49:39.160 align:start position:0%
occupation that doesn't cost the state a
 
02:49:41.309 --> 02:49:41.319 align:start position:0%
dime um you know I'm capped as to how
 
02:49:43.469 --> 02:49:43.479 align:start position:0%
much money I I can make a year I would
 
02:49:45.429 --> 02:49:45.439 align:start position:0%
like to wake up every morning get in a
 
02:49:48.990 --> 02:49:49.000 align:start position:0%
routine go to a job um go go to a
 
02:49:52.550 --> 02:49:52.560 align:start position:0%
Christmas party socialize um earn
 
02:49:56.030 --> 02:49:56.040 align:start position:0%
benefits um and I feel that the gainful
 
02:50:01.030 --> 02:50:01.040 align:start position:0%
occupation really limits that um and
 
02:50:04.030 --> 02:50:04.040 align:start position:0%
every year that cap changes based on
 
02:50:07.070 --> 02:50:07.080 align:start position:0%
this the consumer sound index um if I'm
 
02:50:08.030 --> 02:50:08.040 align:start position:0%
saying that
 
02:50:11.429 --> 02:50:11.439 align:start position:0%
correctly and you know I sell boats I
 
02:50:14.349 --> 02:50:14.359 align:start position:0%
broker boats and I I say that because
 
02:50:15.950 --> 02:50:15.960 align:start position:0%
last year I didn't make a dime doing it
 
02:50:17.190 --> 02:50:17.200 align:start position:0%
because the econom is so bad and
 
02:50:19.269 --> 02:50:19.279 align:start position:0%
interest rates that
 
02:50:22.990 --> 02:50:23.000 align:start position:0%
had it been a great year and I met my
 
02:50:25.750 --> 02:50:25.760 align:start position:0%
cap this year or I went over my cap this
 
02:50:27.429 --> 02:50:27.439 align:start position:0%
year I'd be penalized where we're
 
02:50:29.870 --> 02:50:29.880 align:start position:0%
probably going to have another bad year
 
02:50:32.150 --> 02:50:32.160 align:start position:0%
so the gainful occupation I understand
 
02:50:36.229 --> 02:50:36.239 align:start position:0%
its purpose but in this situation um we
 
02:50:39.630 --> 02:50:39.640 align:start position:0%
feel necessary to to remove it um just
 
02:50:41.510 --> 02:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
to be a productive me member of society
 
02:50:43.110 --> 02:50:43.120 align:start position:0%
because I would like to work a full-time
 
02:50:43.120 --> 02:50:44.670 align:start position:0%
because I would like to work a full-time
job

02:50:44.670 --> 02:50:44.680 align:start position:0%
job
 
02:50:49.269 --> 02:50:49.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:52.670 --> 02:50:52.680 align:start position:0%
um you know at at the end of the day
 
02:50:54.750 --> 02:50:54.760 align:start position:0%
with the restrictions with the
 
02:50:56.229 --> 02:50:56.239 align:start position:0%
legislation regarding the New Hampshire
 
02:50:58.349 --> 02:50:58.359 align:start position:0%
retirement system I almost feel like I
 
02:51:00.830 --> 02:51:00.840 align:start position:0%
being punished for surviving there's a
 
02:51:02.269 --> 02:51:02.279 align:start position:0%
whole slew of
 
02:51:05.269 --> 02:51:05.279 align:start position:0%
benefits uh that are in place through
 
02:51:08.550 --> 02:51:08.560 align:start position:0%
legislation for um the family of the
 
02:51:12.030 --> 02:51:12.040 align:start position:0%
fallen officers um or or or or or
 
02:51:15.990 --> 02:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
firemen uh for group two um and that
 
02:51:17.830 --> 02:51:17.840 align:start position:0%
that restriction I unfortunately feel
 
02:51:19.910 --> 02:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
like it's a punishment
 
02:51:24.030 --> 02:51:24.040 align:start position:0%
um and just because I had uh just under
 
02:51:25.429 --> 02:51:25.439 align:start position:0%
four years on the
 
02:51:30.910 --> 02:51:30.920 align:start position:0%
job um had I been on longer I would have
 
02:51:34.870 --> 02:51:34.880 align:start position:0%
received um a higher monetary benefit
 
02:51:37.190 --> 02:51:37.200 align:start position:0%
and at 45 years old this restriction
 
02:51:39.150 --> 02:51:39.160 align:start position:0%
goes away I'm not sure what the
 
02:51:42.030 --> 02:51:42.040 align:start position:0%
difference between 25 years old that I
 
02:51:43.950 --> 02:51:43.960 align:start position:0%
was when the shooting happened in 45
 
02:51:47.389 --> 02:51:47.399 align:start position:0%
years old that cap to me just doesn't
 
02:51:49.269 --> 02:51:49.279 align:start position:0%
make sense if if this a cap there's a
 
02:51:51.389 --> 02:51:51.399 align:start position:0%
cap if there's not there's not I don't
 
02:51:54.910 --> 02:51:54.920 align:start position:0%
necessarily understand the 45 years old
 
02:51:58.309 --> 02:51:58.319 align:start position:0%
um and um you
 
02:52:01.550 --> 02:52:01.560 align:start position:0%
know this the the six years that I
 
02:52:03.870 --> 02:52:03.880 align:start position:0%
returned as a police officer it was
 
02:52:06.190 --> 02:52:06.200 align:start position:0%
interrupted by a surgery I'd be out for
 
02:52:07.790 --> 02:52:07.800 align:start position:0%
two months three months four months five
 
02:52:09.870 --> 02:52:09.880 align:start position:0%
months at times eight months so I was
 
02:52:12.309 --> 02:52:12.319 align:start position:0%
never able to get a full complete year
 
02:52:15.229 --> 02:52:15.239 align:start position:0%
after the shooting therefore my pension
 
02:52:21.870 --> 02:52:21.880 align:start position:0%
benefit is limited um and to be told at
 
02:52:23.510 --> 02:52:23.520 align:start position:0%
a meeting with the New Hampshire di
 
02:52:26.710 --> 02:52:26.720 align:start position:0%
system when I went there knowing I had
 
02:52:29.190 --> 02:52:29.200 align:start position:0%
10 and a half years of service they told
 
02:52:31.389 --> 02:52:31.399 align:start position:0%
me I had eight eight years like 8.2
 
02:52:34.150 --> 02:52:34.160 align:start position:0%
years and I politely asked what about
 
02:52:35.670 --> 02:52:35.680 align:start position:0%
the other two and a half years and they
 
02:52:38.790 --> 02:52:38.800 align:start position:0%
said well you didn't get credit for all
 
02:52:40.309 --> 02:52:40.319 align:start position:0%
the time well they said more than likely
 
02:52:42.030 --> 02:52:42.040 align:start position:0%
you weren't getting credit for all the
 
02:52:44.670 --> 02:52:44.680 align:start position:0%
times that you were out injured the
 
02:52:47.269 --> 02:52:47.279 align:start position:0%
initial year and then all the follow-up
 
02:52:50.830 --> 02:52:50.840 align:start position:0%
surgeries and I found that to be pretty
 
02:52:53.070 --> 02:52:53.080 align:start position:0%
upsetting considering that the hardest
 
02:52:56.030 --> 02:52:56.040 align:start position:0%
I've ever worked was following the
 
02:52:58.389 --> 02:52:58.399 align:start position:0%
shooting and recovering I was fighting
 
02:53:02.790 --> 02:53:02.800 align:start position:0%
for my life but not getting credit
 
02:53:05.070 --> 02:53:05.080 align:start position:0%
um and
 
02:53:08.510 --> 02:53:08.520 align:start position:0%
um and all all the battles W with with
 
02:53:11.710 --> 02:53:11.720 align:start position:0%
workers comp um that in itself was a
 
02:53:15.790 --> 02:53:15.800 align:start position:0%
post-traumatic stress um uh diagnosis
 
02:53:19.469 --> 02:53:19.479 align:start position:0%
dealing with that um I had that were in
 
02:53:23.990 --> 02:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
collection agencies I I was in um in
 
02:53:26.469 --> 02:53:26.479 align:start position:0%
monetary distress because of some of
 
02:53:29.389 --> 02:53:29.399 align:start position:0%
these bills that weren't being covered
 
02:53:31.950 --> 02:53:31.960 align:start position:0%
um specifically soft tissue that has to
 
02:53:35.710 --> 02:53:35.720 align:start position:0%
do with your organs my legs my my uh my
 
02:53:37.830 --> 02:53:37.840 align:start position:0%
bones no question but when it came to
 
02:53:41.469 --> 02:53:41.479 align:start position:0%
organs sorry that's not covered
 
02:53:44.550 --> 02:53:44.560 align:start position:0%
um so that in itself was just a battle
 
02:53:46.750 --> 02:53:46.760 align:start position:0%
and that's a whole different slew of
 
02:53:48.990 --> 02:53:49.000 align:start position:0%
legislation that that that needs to be
 
02:53:53.229 --> 02:53:53.239 align:start position:0%
fixed um but I don't know if I can take
 
02:53:58.110 --> 02:53:58.120 align:start position:0%
take take that on as well um but I want
 
02:54:00.030 --> 02:54:00.040 align:start position:0%
to thank you for your time and and
 
02:54:02.309 --> 02:54:02.319 align:start position:0%
listening to me um any questions that
 
02:54:04.469 --> 02:54:04.479 align:start position:0%
you might have feel
 
02:54:07.870 --> 02:54:07.880 align:start position:0%
free thank you Mr dty I'm very glad you
 
02:54:09.790 --> 02:54:09.800 align:start position:0%
survived that our deal as well as you
 
02:54:12.070 --> 02:54:12.080 align:start position:0%
did thank you and we will have to look
 
02:54:14.910 --> 02:54:14.920 align:start position:0%
into why time out on workers comp
 
02:54:16.550 --> 02:54:16.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't apply to your pension because
 
02:54:19.110 --> 02:54:19.120 align:start position:0%
that seems like a systemic problem not
 
02:54:21.830 --> 02:54:21.840 align:start position:0%
just with with people who are
 
02:54:23.790 --> 02:54:23.800 align:start position:0%
permanently disabled but people who are
 
02:54:26.750 --> 02:54:26.760 align:start position:0%
out for a shorter period of time but
 
02:54:28.830 --> 02:54:28.840 align:start position:0%
anyway are there any
 
02:54:31.110 --> 02:54:31.120 align:start position:0%
questions I don't see any thank you very
 
02:54:36.110 --> 02:54:36.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:49.710 --> 02:54:49.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:51.429 --> 02:54:51.439 align:start position:0%
good afternoon everybody U my name is
 
02:54:53.710 --> 02:54:53.720 align:start position:0%
Paul Lewis I'm one of the two officers
 
02:54:56.070 --> 02:54:56.080 align:start position:0%
that we know will be directly benefiting
 
02:54:58.590 --> 02:54:58.600 align:start position:0%
from the bill and I would like to say
 
02:55:00.710 --> 02:55:00.720 align:start position:0%
it's it's never easy sharing the story
 
02:55:04.150 --> 02:55:04.160 align:start position:0%
so um I do my best but it's it can be
 
02:55:05.710 --> 02:55:05.720 align:start position:0%
difficult we'll take your word for it
 
02:55:08.229 --> 02:55:08.239 align:start position:0%
okay okay we're we're already an hour
 
02:55:11.630 --> 02:55:11.640 align:start position:0%
late so we'll uh any brevity is
 
02:55:13.110 --> 02:55:13.120 align:start position:0%
appreciated all right I'll stick I'll
 
02:55:15.550 --> 02:55:15.560 align:start position:0%
stick to the point uh a subtle backstory
 
02:55:18.590 --> 02:55:18.600 align:start position:0%
so I had a dream of doing as much good
 
02:55:21.110 --> 02:55:21.120 align:start position:0%
as I could in this this world I I got a
 
02:55:23.910 --> 02:55:23.920 align:start position:0%
master's degree in social work with um
 
02:55:25.950 --> 02:55:25.960 align:start position:0%
the motivation to then become a police
 
02:55:28.389 --> 02:55:28.399 align:start position:0%
officer I wanted to understand why
 
02:55:30.630 --> 02:55:30.640 align:start position:0%
people commit the crimes and um get
 
02:55:34.110 --> 02:55:34.120 align:start position:0%
ahead of of the issues and and uh be the
 
02:55:35.710 --> 02:55:35.720 align:start position:0%
best police officer I could I had a lot
 
02:55:38.429 --> 02:55:38.439 align:start position:0%
of Dreams in the career eight months out
 
02:55:40.950 --> 02:55:40.960 align:start position:0%
of the police academy I was called to a
 
02:55:43.550 --> 02:55:43.560 align:start position:0%
domestic where a husband was holding his
 
02:55:46.550 --> 02:55:46.560 align:start position:0%
wife hostage with multiple Firearms she
 
02:55:48.510 --> 02:55:48.520 align:start position:0%
was able to sneak away for a couple
 
02:55:51.550 --> 02:55:51.560 align:start position:0%
seconds text her parents who called us
 
02:55:54.190 --> 02:55:54.200 align:start position:0%
and uh we went there uh when we got to
 
02:55:56.950 --> 02:55:56.960 align:start position:0%
the house um he was in fact holding her
 
02:55:59.030 --> 02:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
hostage with multiple Firearms we put
 
02:56:01.389 --> 02:56:01.399 align:start position:0%
oursel my sergeant and I uh in we're in
 
02:56:03.830 --> 02:56:03.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire it's a only 12 officer
 
02:56:05.750 --> 02:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
Department it was just us on we put
 
02:56:08.190 --> 02:56:08.200 align:start position:0%
ourselves in between the husband and the
 
02:56:10.950 --> 02:56:10.960 align:start position:0%
wife uh when we did that he shot six
 
02:56:13.510 --> 02:56:13.520 align:start position:0%
times at us and two hit me in my
 
02:56:15.950 --> 02:56:15.960 align:start position:0%
dominant arm we were able to save her
 
02:56:18.830 --> 02:56:18.840 align:start position:0%
but my life was then on the line was an
 
02:56:21.030 --> 02:56:21.040 align:start position:0%
artery was severed and um I was bleeding
 
02:56:23.990 --> 02:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
out quickly luckily we had a tourniquet
 
02:56:27.150 --> 02:56:27.160 align:start position:0%
that was put on me and I got rushed to
 
02:56:30.269 --> 02:56:30.279 align:start position:0%
the hospital and my life was saved uh
 
02:56:32.910 --> 02:56:32.920 align:start position:0%
when I woke up I was told by the surgeon
 
02:56:35.630 --> 02:56:35.640 align:start position:0%
that I had permanent nerve damage and I
 
02:56:37.710 --> 02:56:37.720 align:start position:0%
would likely never be able to use my
 
02:56:41.150 --> 02:56:41.160 align:start position:0%
dominant hand again I spent the next
 
02:56:43.710 --> 02:56:43.720 align:start position:0%
three years um undergoing five surgeries
 
02:56:46.190 --> 02:56:46.200 align:start position:0%
trying to learn how to live life
 
02:56:48.790 --> 02:56:48.800 align:start position:0%
left-handed I I only had one hand and I
 
02:56:50.910 --> 02:56:50.920 align:start position:0%
lost my full Independence I I needed
 
02:56:53.990 --> 02:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
help eating shaving showering everything
 
02:56:55.830 --> 02:56:55.840 align:start position:0%
I I still can't really write to this
 
02:56:59.070 --> 02:56:59.080 align:start position:0%
this day so I I I was I moved to New
 
02:57:01.030 --> 02:57:01.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to become a police officer I
 
02:57:04.550 --> 02:57:04.560 align:start position:0%
was such an independent person and now I
 
02:57:08.469 --> 02:57:08.479 align:start position:0%
Rely um on so many people for everything
 
02:57:10.269 --> 02:57:10.279 align:start position:0%
I had a dream to return but it was
 
02:57:12.429 --> 02:57:12.439 align:start position:0%
determined it was too unsafe for me to
 
02:57:16.790 --> 02:57:16.800 align:start position:0%
do so the hardest part of it all was um
 
02:57:18.950 --> 02:57:18.960 align:start position:0%
after I retired October
 
02:57:21.389 --> 02:57:21.399 align:start position:0%
2021 I was told what my benefits would
 
02:57:23.910 --> 02:57:23.920 align:start position:0%
be at the time I was making
 
02:57:27.710 --> 02:57:27.720 align:start position:0%
$21.50 an hour I found out my benefit is
 
02:57:31.229 --> 02:57:31.239 align:start position:0%
66% of that so my total pension is
 
02:57:35.229 --> 02:57:35.239 align:start position:0%
$29,000 per year on top of that I have
 
02:57:37.590 --> 02:57:37.600 align:start position:0%
to pay my own health insurance in in
 
02:57:40.190 --> 02:57:40.200 align:start position:0%
fact I went in front of the town awar uh
 
02:57:43.190 --> 02:57:43.200 align:start position:0%
right after I retired and I asked for
 
02:57:46.030 --> 02:57:46.040 align:start position:0%
Aid in health insurance they said
 
02:57:48.349 --> 02:57:48.359 align:start position:0%
they'll pay half of it for a year and
 
02:57:50.830 --> 02:57:50.840 align:start position:0%
then I'm on my own I returned a year
 
02:57:53.229 --> 02:57:53.239 align:start position:0%
later and I said I can't afford this can
 
02:57:54.790 --> 02:57:54.800 align:start position:0%
you please help me at least until we
 
02:57:57.309 --> 02:57:57.319 align:start position:0%
figure out the end result of this bill
 
02:57:58.990 --> 02:57:59.000 align:start position:0%
they said no you're too
 
02:58:04.510 --> 02:58:04.520 align:start position:0%
expensive so a large portion of my my uh
 
02:58:05.870 --> 02:58:05.880 align:start position:0%
benefit is taken from the health
 
02:58:08.269 --> 02:58:08.279 align:start position:0%
insurance and I'm single I'm unmarried I
 
02:58:10.349 --> 02:58:10.359 align:start position:0%
can't rely on anybody else to help me
 
02:58:13.190 --> 02:58:13.200 align:start position:0%
with with this health insurance and then
 
02:58:15.269 --> 02:58:15.279 align:start position:0%
uh F the difficulty I'm capped on my
 
02:58:17.510 --> 02:58:17.520 align:start position:0%
earnings we're only allowed to fill in
 
02:58:21.309 --> 02:58:21.319 align:start position:0%
that last 33% of the 66 we make so I'm
 
02:58:22.590 --> 02:58:22.600 align:start position:0%
only allowed
 
02:58:25.990 --> 02:58:26.000 align:start position:0%
$20,000 per year I don't know what I'm
 
02:58:28.870 --> 02:58:28.880 align:start position:0%
capable of yet I can't write I I can I
 
02:58:31.030 --> 02:58:31.040 align:start position:0%
could barely butt in these shirts today
 
02:58:33.349 --> 02:58:33.359 align:start position:0%
but I would like to eventually find out
 
02:58:35.469 --> 02:58:35.479 align:start position:0%
what I am capable of with the
 
02:58:36.990 --> 02:58:37.000 align:start position:0%
limitations on this
 
02:58:39.870 --> 02:58:39.880 align:start position:0%
cap what can I do making $20,000 per
 
02:58:42.910 --> 02:58:42.920 align:start position:0%
year it's almost like count myself out
 
02:58:45.710 --> 02:58:45.720 align:start position:0%
because there's any job would make more
 
02:58:48.309 --> 02:58:48.319 align:start position:0%
than that and when I start to then
 
02:58:50.030 --> 02:58:50.040 align:start position:0%
they'll start taking my pension any
 
02:58:51.790 --> 02:58:51.800 align:start position:0%
motivation is just completely lost by
 
02:58:55.590 --> 02:58:55.600 align:start position:0%
that number um I'm having difficulties
 
02:58:58.229 --> 02:58:58.239 align:start position:0%
surviving based on that 29,000 I I get
 
02:59:00.110 --> 02:59:00.120 align:start position:0%
support from my family I I found a
 
02:59:03.750 --> 02:59:03.760 align:start position:0%
roommate to to help me pay bills but I I
 
02:59:05.429 --> 02:59:05.439 align:start position:0%
wasn't working in a big city I was
 
02:59:07.670 --> 02:59:07.680 align:start position:0%
pretty much on my own since the incident
 
02:59:09.590 --> 02:59:09.600 align:start position:0%
happened and it seems like every time I
 
02:59:11.750 --> 02:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
asked for help I'm just told I'm too
 
02:59:13.670 --> 02:59:13.680 align:start position:0%
expensive and I'm thrown away I don't
 
02:59:16.429 --> 02:59:16.439 align:start position:0%
even hear from the town anymore and
 
02:59:18.429 --> 02:59:18.439 align:start position:0%
fortunately I found the people behind me
 
02:59:21.030 --> 02:59:21.040 align:start position:0%
to help me fight through my battles uh
 
02:59:23.110 --> 02:59:23.120 align:start position:0%
Dan and I the only two officers in New
 
02:59:26.190 --> 02:59:26.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that have survived a shooting
 
02:59:27.630 --> 02:59:27.640 align:start position:0%
and medically retired we've been there
 
02:59:29.429 --> 02:59:29.439 align:start position:0%
for each other and uh he's been my
 
02:59:32.070 --> 02:59:32.080 align:start position:0%
number one support and if there were any
 
02:59:34.510 --> 02:59:34.520 align:start position:0%
others I'm sure that uh we would have
 
02:59:36.229 --> 02:59:36.239 align:start position:0%
found them we're a small community here
 
02:59:38.670 --> 02:59:38.680 align:start position:0%
but it's just been us two
 
02:59:42.550 --> 02:59:42.560 align:start position:0%
and I really just beyond anything else
 
02:59:45.349 --> 02:59:45.359 align:start position:0%
I'm hopeful that you all will consider
 
02:59:48.150 --> 02:59:48.160 align:start position:0%
helping us it's a very small number
 
02:59:49.550 --> 02:59:49.560 align:start position:0%
people that will be helped in we
 
02:59:51.870 --> 02:59:51.880 align:start position:0%
desperately need it we've had a lot of
 
02:59:53.910 --> 02:59:53.920 align:start position:0%
setbacks both of us every time we get up
 
02:59:56.670 --> 02:59:56.680 align:start position:0%
for in the door we have a setback and we
 
02:59:58.630 --> 02:59:58.640 align:start position:0%
need an additional surgery and it's just
 
03:00:01.750 --> 03:00:01.760 align:start position:0%
been non-stop so I'm hopeful that um you
 
03:00:04.590 --> 03:00:04.600 align:start position:0%
give us the opportunity to to
 
03:00:07.030 --> 03:00:07.040 align:start position:0%

moments before me they're confronting
 
03:03:21.229 --> 03:03:21.239 align:start position:0%
three suspects getting into a car I pull
 
03:03:22.830 --> 03:03:22.840 align:start position:0%
on the parking lot I see something going
 
03:03:25.630 --> 03:03:25.640 align:start position:0%

03:03:28.590 --> 03:03:28.600 align:start position:0%
out of the cruiser uh that vehicle flees
 
03:03:30.870 --> 03:03:30.880 align:start position:0%
from those offices and as it flees it
 
03:03:32.190 --> 03:03:32.200 align:start position:0%

for a year and a half uh a lot of the
 
03:04:45.229 --> 03:04:45.239 align:start position:0%
guys didn't touch on the Family Impact
 
03:04:48.070 --> 03:04:48.080 align:start position:0%
and I'll just say that my family was
 
03:04:51.349 --> 03:04:51.359 align:start position:0%
devastated I'm the longone worker within
 
03:04:53.349 --> 03:04:53.359 align:start position:0%
that household you know my wife wanted
 
03:04:54.750 --> 03:04:54.760 align:start position:0%
to be a good mother and be home with the
 
03:04:56.630 --> 03:04:56.640 align:start position:0%
kids and I had their opportunity to work
 
03:04:58.670 --> 03:04:58.680 align:start position:0%
over time and help raise a family and
 
03:05:00.550 --> 03:05:00.560 align:start position:0%
that's what we're doing so then we're
 
03:05:03.550 --> 03:05:03.560 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden thrown into me making
 
03:05:06.190 --> 03:05:06.200 align:start position:0%
you know minimum amount of money and
 
03:05:08.510 --> 03:05:08.520 align:start position:0%
trying to raise a family sure our
 
03:05:10.070 --> 03:05:10.080 align:start position:0%
friends help trying to raise this for us
 
03:05:12.030 --> 03:05:12.040 align:start position:0%
it helped tremendously but the college
 
03:05:13.830 --> 03:05:13.840 align:start position:0%
fund starts dis appearing all the
 
03:05:16.630 --> 03:05:16.640 align:start position:0%
fundraisers quickly disappear you know
 
03:05:18.349 --> 03:05:18.359 align:start position:0%
and then fighting with the insurance
 
03:05:19.910 --> 03:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
companies you know I was getting bills
 
03:05:22.389 --> 03:05:22.399 align:start position:0%
for major surgeries it's like didn't you
 
03:05:25.030 --> 03:05:25.040 align:start position:0%
guys know this was part of my injury uh
 
03:05:27.150 --> 03:05:27.160 align:start position:0%
and it's just this constant battle which
 
03:05:28.670 --> 03:05:28.680 align:start position:0%
and then just trying to buy things to
 
03:05:30.469 --> 03:05:30.479 align:start position:0%
survive with learning how to sit on the
 
03:05:31.990 --> 03:05:32.000 align:start position:0%
toilet you you're building up your
 
03:05:33.910 --> 03:05:33.920 align:start position:0%
bathroom with all the you know the
 
03:05:36.630 --> 03:05:36.640 align:start position:0%
handicap abilities I can't tell you how
 
03:05:38.349 --> 03:05:38.359 align:start position:0%
many times I was on the floor crying my
 
03:05:42.349 --> 03:05:42.359 align:start position:0%
butt off uh in front of My Wife and Kids
 
03:05:44.870 --> 03:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
so my kids have been affected because of
 
03:05:46.550 --> 03:05:46.560 align:start position:0%
the injury just watching me a guy that
 
03:05:47.990 --> 03:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
was always a high charger want to play
 
03:05:49.830 --> 03:05:49.840 align:start position:0%
with the kids when I was out of work I
 
03:05:52.510 --> 03:05:52.520 align:start position:0%
was with my family uh and then they saw
 
03:05:54.469 --> 03:05:54.479 align:start position:0%
me sitting on a recliner for a year and
 
03:05:56.670 --> 03:05:56.680 align:start position:0%
a half trying to recover uh then when I
 
03:05:58.670 --> 03:05:58.680 align:start position:0%
started walking again sure the pain sets
 
03:06:01.670 --> 03:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
in even more so I'm sure I wasn't too
 
03:06:03.389 --> 03:06:03.399 align:start position:0%
Pleasant at that point and then the
 
03:06:05.150 --> 03:06:05.160 align:start position:0%
aggravation of knowing that I'm not that
 
03:06:07.750 --> 03:06:07.760 align:start position:0%
hot charger I was I wasn't saving lives
 
03:06:10.389 --> 03:06:10.399 align:start position:0%
I wasn't trying to uh you know be a good
 
03:06:13.349 --> 03:06:13.359 align:start position:0%
man be a good father be a good husband
 
03:06:14.950 --> 03:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
you know and the devastation that that
 
03:06:18.790 --> 03:06:18.800 align:start position:0%
put on me and my family was crazy
 
03:06:21.670 --> 03:06:21.680 align:start position:0%
and um so right now we're still fighting
 
03:06:23.870 --> 03:06:23.880 align:start position:0%
down in Massachusetts for Bill similar
 
03:06:27.030 --> 03:06:27.040 align:start position:0%
to this to pass uh you know and these
 
03:06:29.910 --> 03:06:29.920 align:start position:0%
guys talked about the ability to work I
 
03:06:31.550 --> 03:06:31.560 align:start position:0%
I wanted to take courses I you know I
 
03:06:34.349 --> 03:06:34.359 align:start position:0%
know I can't go back to the job um but I
 
03:06:36.510 --> 03:06:36.520 align:start position:0%
want to take courses my whole life was
 
03:06:39.110 --> 03:06:39.120 align:start position:0%

take a course to learn how to do
 
03:06:42.870 --> 03:06:42.880 align:start position:0%
something and if I become good at it
 
03:06:45.429 --> 03:06:45.439 align:start position:0%
then you're going to limit me on what I
 
03:06:48.429 --> 03:06:48.439 align:start position:0%
can make which it doesn't seem right it
 
03:06:49.830 --> 03:06:49.840 align:start position:0%

03:06:51.790 --> 03:06:51.800 align:start position:0%

03:09:57.790 --> 03:09:57.800 align:start position:0%
little bit on what an officer would get
 
03:10:00.510 --> 03:10:00.520 align:start position:0%
if they died in the line of duty in this
 
03:10:02.670 --> 03:10:02.680 align:start position:0%
case we're in New Hampshire officer Dar
 
03:10:05.389 --> 03:10:05.399 align:start position:0%
and officer Lewis had they died the
 
03:10:07.389 --> 03:10:07.399 align:start position:0%
evening that they were shot their
 
03:10:09.550 --> 03:10:09.560 align:start position:0%
spouses would have received a one-time
 
03:10:11.870 --> 03:10:11.880 align:start position:0%
Federal payment of
 
03:10:11.880 --> 03:10:13.750 align:start position:0%
Federal payment of
$437,500

03:10:13.750 --> 03:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
$437,500
 
03:10:16.670 --> 03:10:16.680 align:start position:0%
taxfree from the federal government the
 
03:10:18.550 --> 03:10:18.560 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire gives a
 
03:10:21.469 --> 03:10:21.479 align:start position:0%
$100,000 tax-free payout it's different
 
03:10:24.550 --> 03:10:24.560 align:start position:0%
a mass it's 300,000 a mass the espouses
 
03:10:27.710 --> 03:10:27.720 align:start position:0%
or beneficiary would receive 100% of
 
03:10:29.710 --> 03:10:29.720 align:start position:0%
their base salary at the rank that they
 
03:10:33.110 --> 03:10:33.120 align:start position:0%
held at the time of their death okay
 
03:10:34.910 --> 03:10:34.920 align:start position:0%
their children if they had children
 
03:10:36.750 --> 03:10:36.760 align:start position:0%
would receive instate College tuition
 
03:10:39.550 --> 03:10:39.560 align:start position:0%
for free four
 
03:10:42.150 --> 03:10:42.160 align:start position:0%
years however because they were brave
 
03:10:43.229 --> 03:10:43.239 align:start position:0%
enough to
 
03:10:46.990 --> 03:10:47.000 align:start position:0%
survive they both received 66 and 23%
 
03:10:49.389 --> 03:10:49.399 align:start position:0%
half for their pay so what's the message
 
03:10:50.790 --> 03:10:50.800 align:start position:0%
that this state is sending to your
 
03:10:53.710 --> 03:10:53.720 align:start position:0%
officers you're worth more dead than you
 
03:10:53.720 --> 03:10:54.630 align:start position:0%
officers you're worth more dead than you
are

03:10:54.630 --> 03:10:54.640 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:10:57.630 --> 03:10:57.640 align:start position:0%
alive I know it's not any of your fault
 
03:10:59.349 --> 03:10:59.359 align:start position:0%
like ma' what you said it's a broken
 
03:11:01.469 --> 03:11:01.479 align:start position:0%
system but you have an opportunity to
 
03:11:01.479 --> 03:11:02.870 align:start position:0%
system but you have an opportunity to
fix

03:11:02.870 --> 03:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
fix
 
03:11:07.510 --> 03:11:07.520 align:start position:0%
it okay it's horrific it's sad that an
 
03:11:10.190 --> 03:11:10.200 align:start position:0%
officer has to be punished financially
 
03:11:12.870 --> 03:11:12.880 align:start position:0%
speaking for surviving an
 
03:11:15.070 --> 03:11:15.080 align:start position:0%
ordeal it shouldn't be like this this is
 
03:11:17.630 --> 03:11:17.640 align:start position:0%
America the greatest country on on Earth
 
03:11:20.229 --> 03:11:20.239 align:start position:0%
we are better than this we need to fix
 
03:11:23.910 --> 03:11:23.920 align:start position:0%
it thank you thank you and again
 
03:11:25.990 --> 03:11:26.000 align:start position:0%
congratulations on surviv I hope that
 
03:11:27.429 --> 03:11:27.439 align:start position:0%
this committee votes favorably on this
 
03:11:30.830 --> 03:11:30.840 align:start position:0%
bill and passes it thank you for your
 
03:11:33.269 --> 03:11:33.279 align:start position:0%
time representative Schmidt has a
 
03:11:35.910 --> 03:11:35.920 align:start position:0%
question yes
 
03:11:40.590 --> 03:11:40.600 align:start position:0%
sir thank you madam chair uh Mr
 
03:11:45.389 --> 03:11:45.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:49.190 --> 03:11:49.200 align:start position:0%
I I I I'm I'm asking you the questions
 
03:11:52.309 --> 03:11:52.319 align:start position:0%
because it seems like just possible that
 
03:11:54.429 --> 03:11:54.439 align:start position:0%
you're not in as much pain right at the
 
03:11:57.070 --> 03:11:57.080 align:start position:0%
moment as some of the previous Witnesses
 
03:11:57.080 --> 03:11:58.110 align:start position:0%
moment as some of the previous Witnesses
have

03:11:58.110 --> 03:11:58.120 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:12:01.389 --> 03:12:01.399 align:start position:0%
been uh I I I was part of this committee
 
03:12:04.070 --> 03:12:04.080 align:start position:0%
when we passed the bill that gave the
 
03:12:06.950 --> 03:12:06.960 align:start position:0%
$100,000 death benefit to police
 
03:12:08.269 --> 03:12:08.279 align:start position:0%
officers and
 
03:12:08.279 --> 03:12:09.830 align:start position:0%
officers and
firefighters

03:12:09.830 --> 03:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
firefighters
 
03:12:14.790 --> 03:12:14.800 align:start position:0%
okay um but I'm astonished that to hear
 
03:12:18.309 --> 03:12:18.319 align:start position:0%
that that the insurance cover
 
03:12:21.429 --> 03:12:21.439 align:start position:0%
is as minimal as it is in terms
 
03:12:25.710 --> 03:12:25.720 align:start position:0%
of even covering the bills that you all
 
03:12:29.670 --> 03:12:29.680 align:start position:0%
have had um I'm and I'm wondering
 
03:12:33.429 --> 03:12:33.439 align:start position:0%
whether I ask you just as a technical
 
03:12:36.710 --> 03:12:36.720 align:start position:0%
question have have any of you been
 
03:12:38.790 --> 03:12:38.800 align:start position:0%
counseled and maybe you know because you
 
03:12:40.870 --> 03:12:40.880 align:start position:0%
seem to be quite
 
03:12:43.750 --> 03:12:43.760 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable um have any of you been
 
03:12:46.190 --> 03:12:46.200 align:start position:0%
counseled to sue the state or your the
 
03:12:47.630 --> 03:12:47.640 align:start position:0%
department involved
 
03:12:52.229 --> 03:12:52.239 align:start position:0%
D for the damage that was inflicted on
 
03:12:55.429 --> 03:12:55.439 align:start position:0%
you obviously against your will with no
 
03:12:58.950 --> 03:12:58.960 align:start position:0%
intent on your part by somebody who was
 
03:13:02.190 --> 03:13:02.200 align:start position:0%
in the act of committing a crime for
 
03:13:07.429 --> 03:13:07.439 align:start position:0%
which they probably um uh have been
 
03:13:09.630 --> 03:13:09.640 align:start position:0%
sentenced to a long time in prison so
 
03:13:11.950 --> 03:13:11.960 align:start position:0%
can you tell me whether you've ever been
 
03:13:15.630 --> 03:13:15.640 align:start position:0%
cons advised to sue the state or the
 
03:13:17.950 --> 03:13:17.960 align:start position:0%
department because
 
03:13:20.510 --> 03:13:20.520 align:start position:0%
great harm has been done to you and your
 
03:13:23.070 --> 03:13:23.080 align:start position:0%
colleagues that have spoken before you
 
03:13:24.910 --> 03:13:24.920 align:start position:0%
sir uh I'll try to answer your question
 
03:13:26.710 --> 03:13:26.720 align:start position:0%
sir thank you so the laws are obviously
 
03:13:28.349 --> 03:13:28.359 align:start position:0%
different in mass than they are in New
 
03:13:30.910 --> 03:13:30.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in in
 
03:13:32.790 --> 03:13:32.800 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts we have individual
 
03:13:34.750 --> 03:13:34.760 align:start position:0%
Retirement Systems and in the city of
 
03:13:38.349 --> 03:13:38.359 align:start position:0%
Somerville we had our own um separate
 
03:13:41.429 --> 03:13:41.439 align:start position:0%
retirement system the retirement system
 
03:13:44.590 --> 03:13:44.600 align:start position:0%
pays my base salary 100% of my base
 
03:13:48.630 --> 03:13:48.640 align:start position:0%
salary I pay my insurance through it's
 
03:13:51.750 --> 03:13:51.760 align:start position:0%
deducted through my the 100% income that
 
03:13:54.550 --> 03:13:54.560 align:start position:0%
I make on a monthly basis as far as
 
03:13:57.950 --> 03:13:57.960 align:start position:0%
filing lawsuit against the subject who
 
03:14:00.750 --> 03:14:00.760 align:start position:0%
shot me he's dead I'm not I can't sue
 
03:14:03.950 --> 03:14:03.960 align:start position:0%
anybody so every situation is different
 
03:14:07.870 --> 03:14:07.880 align:start position:0%
um could we potentially possibly but it
 
03:14:10.309 --> 03:14:10.319 align:start position:0%
it's just it draws out the process these
 
03:14:12.790 --> 03:14:12.800 align:start position:0%
folks are traumatized enough as it is
 
03:14:15.269 --> 03:14:15.279 align:start position:0%
going through what they've gone through
 
03:14:18.990 --> 03:14:19.000 align:start position:0%
as have I what we want is to remedy have
 
03:14:21.630 --> 03:14:21.640 align:start position:0%
a an equitable Fair process that we can
 
03:14:23.830 --> 03:14:23.840 align:start position:0%
retire with dignity and move on with our
 
03:14:26.110 --> 03:14:26.120 align:start position:0%
lives and to Echo what my brothers and
 
03:14:28.309 --> 03:14:28.319 align:start position:0%

03:14:30.750 --> 03:14:30.760 align:start position:0%
be productive members of society and be
 
03:14:32.750 --> 03:14:32.760 align:start position:0%

03:14:35.349 --> 03:14:35.359 align:start position:0%
and take care of our families what do we
 
03:14:37.510 --> 03:14:37.520 align:start position:0%
do to deserve this other than put on our
 
03:14:39.510 --> 03:14:39.520 align:start position:0%
our uniforms and our badge and have the
 
03:14:41.830 --> 03:14:41.840 align:start position:0%
courage to go out on the street and take
 
03:14:44.229 --> 03:14:44.239 align:start position:0%

dearly that's what what we're guilty of
 
03:14:51.510 --> 03:14:51.520 align:start position:0%
doing our
 
03:14:53.990 --> 03:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
jobs and I'll tell you I'll close with
 
03:14:56.150 --> 03:14:56.160 align:start position:0%
this police officers are the guardians
 
03:14:58.990 --> 03:14:59.000 align:start position:0%
of our communities without them we have
 
03:15:02.030 --> 03:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
chaos and Anarchy we owe it to them to
 
03:15:04.389 --> 03:15:04.399 align:start position:0%

03:15:07.150 --> 03:15:07.160 align:start position:0%

no anyone else wish to testify on Senate
 
03:15:25.520 --> 03:15:27.389 align:start position:0%
no anyone else wish to testify on Senate
Bill

03:15:27.389 --> 03:15:27.399 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
03:15:38.990 --> 03:15:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:41.990 --> 03:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
der to to answer your um question
 
03:15:44.189 --> 03:15:44.199 align:start position:0%
specifically I did approach the the the
 
03:15:46.349 --> 03:15:46.359 align:start position:0%
city of Manchester regarding your
 
03:15:46.359 --> 03:15:47.550 align:start position:0%
city of Manchester regarding your
question

03:15:47.550 --> 03:15:47.560 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:15:50.110 --> 03:15:50.120 align:start position:0%
and I was told that we can't set
 
03:15:52.550 --> 03:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
precedent um and that was the end of
 
03:15:55.110 --> 03:15:55.120 align:start position:0%
that and as far as any type of
 
03:15:58.349 --> 03:15:58.359 align:start position:0%
lawsuit it just what wasn't considered
 
03:16:00.550 --> 03:16:00.560 align:start position:0%
we were more insulted by the response
 
03:16:04.269 --> 03:16:04.279 align:start position:0%
than anything and we just let it go but
 
03:16:07.830 --> 03:16:07.840 align:start position:0%
um with respect to this most recent
 
03:16:11.349 --> 03:16:11.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:14.790 --> 03:16:14.800 align:start position:0%
to I'm very well invested in in law
 
03:16:17.510 --> 03:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
enforcement in in the fire world in the
 
03:16:18.590 --> 03:16:18.600 align:start position:0%
state of New
 
03:16:21.550 --> 03:16:21.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and any major incident where
 
03:16:23.670 --> 03:16:23.680 align:start position:0%
someone got seriously injured that would
 
03:16:26.229 --> 03:16:26.239 align:start position:0%
qualify for accidental disability I
 
03:16:28.309 --> 03:16:28.319 align:start position:0%
assure you I would know about it and I
 
03:16:31.830 --> 03:16:31.840 align:start position:0%
do know of incidents however Paul Lewis
 
03:16:33.670 --> 03:16:33.680 align:start position:0%
and I are the only two current
 
03:16:37.550 --> 03:16:37.560 align:start position:0%
accidental disability benefit recipients
 
03:16:40.110 --> 03:16:40.120 align:start position:0%
currently that would qualify for what's
 
03:16:42.670 --> 03:16:42.680 align:start position:0%
in in front of you now since the
 
03:16:44.550 --> 03:16:44.560 align:start position:0%
amendment I'm not exactly sure what that
 
03:16:47.550 --> 03:16:47.560 align:start position:0%
has changed but prior to this amendment
 
03:16:49.429 --> 03:16:49.439 align:start position:0%
Paul Lewis and I are the only two that
 
03:16:52.070 --> 03:16:52.080 align:start position:0%
currently receive this this so as far as
 
03:16:53.950 --> 03:16:53.960 align:start position:0%
thei Financial
 
03:16:58.670 --> 03:16:58.680 align:start position:0%
impact in my opinion it's grossly
 
03:17:02.030 --> 03:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
overestimated considering that in our
 
03:17:03.990 --> 03:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
estimates that it would be about two
 
03:17:07.590 --> 03:17:07.600 align:start position:0%
$200,000 a year approximately thank you
 
03:17:10.630 --> 03:17:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:15.710 --> 03:17:15.720 align:start position:0%
you anyone else okay I'm going to close
 
03:17:19.070 --> 03:17:19.080 align:start position:0%
the hearing on Senate Bill 134 and open
 
03:17:22.950 --> 03:17:22.960 align:start position:0%
the hearing on Senate Bill 600 and and
 
03:17:45.630 --> 03:17:45.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:47.790 --> 03:17:47.800 align:start position:0%
luck just
 
03:17:49.990 --> 03:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
sure I understand
 
03:17:58.189 --> 03:17:58.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:04.070 --> 03:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:06.750 --> 03:18:06.760 align:start position:0%
yours thank you and good afternoon Mr
 
03:18:10.150 --> 03:18:10.160 align:start position:0%
chair and members of the committee um I
 
03:18:12.910 --> 03:18:12.920 align:start position:0%
appreciate uh you having me here today
 
03:18:14.990 --> 03:18:15.000 align:start position:0%
my name is Shannon chandley and I serve
 
03:18:18.389 --> 03:18:18.399 align:start position:0%
the people of Senate District 11 um I
 
03:18:20.790 --> 03:18:20.800 align:start position:0%
come before you today to introduce
 
03:18:22.189 --> 03:18:22.199 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill
 
03:18:26.750 --> 03:18:26.760 align:start position:0%
600 um Senate Bill 600 is a result of
 
03:18:29.590 --> 03:18:29.600 align:start position:0%
information I learned from a constituent
 
03:18:33.349 --> 03:18:33.359 align:start position:0%
and that is that um pharmacy technicians
 
03:18:36.710 --> 03:18:36.720 align:start position:0%
are not members of the board that
 
03:18:40.189 --> 03:18:40.199 align:start position:0%
certifies them and that they are in fact
 
03:18:44.030 --> 03:18:44.040 align:start position:0%
prohibited from being on the Board of
 
03:18:47.150 --> 03:18:47.160 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy that is because
 
03:18:51.229 --> 03:18:51.239 align:start position:0%
um the board can consist only of
 
03:18:54.750 --> 03:18:54.760 align:start position:0%
Pharmacists in its current form only
 
03:18:59.269 --> 03:18:59.279 align:start position:0%
Pharmacists and uh members of the public
 
03:19:01.990 --> 03:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
but the member of the public cannot in
 
03:19:04.870 --> 03:19:04.880 align:start position:0%
fact be a pharmacy technician or the
 
03:19:08.150 --> 03:19:08.160 align:start position:0%
spouse of one so what happens then is
 
03:19:10.950 --> 03:19:10.960 align:start position:0%
that pharmacy technicians cannot serve
 
03:19:13.429 --> 03:19:13.439 align:start position:0%
on the board which is in fact
 
03:19:17.269 --> 03:19:17.279 align:start position:0%
responsible for their certification
 
03:19:19.510 --> 03:19:19.520 align:start position:0%
um when I learned this it seemed like it
 
03:19:21.510 --> 03:19:21.520 align:start position:0%
would be reasonable to add them and I
 
03:19:23.990 --> 03:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
reached out to a number of stakeholders
 
03:19:28.429 --> 03:19:28.439 align:start position:0%
and um there was uh great um uh
 
03:19:30.349 --> 03:19:30.359 align:start position:0%
concurrence that this probably should
 
03:19:32.110 --> 03:19:32.120 align:start position:0%
happen that I don't believe that we have
 
03:19:34.710 --> 03:19:34.720 align:start position:0%
other boards where a person is subject
 
03:19:38.110 --> 03:19:38.120 align:start position:0%
to the um rule of the board but is not
 
03:19:40.070 --> 03:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
allowed to be a me that no one in that
 
03:19:42.389 --> 03:19:42.399 align:start position:0%
profession is allowed to be a member so
 
03:19:47.110 --> 03:19:47.120 align:start position:0%
the bill does that it uh adds
 
03:19:50.150 --> 03:19:50.160 align:start position:0%
the um pharmacy technician to the board
 
03:19:52.510 --> 03:19:52.520 align:start position:0%
and there are some rules around how that
 
03:19:55.389 --> 03:19:55.399 align:start position:0%
is done
 
03:19:58.070 --> 03:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
um the bill
 
03:20:03.229 --> 03:20:03.239 align:start position:0%
also uh what the bill also does is um
 
03:20:07.790 --> 03:20:07.800 align:start position:0%
change the number of um folks on the
 
03:20:11.750 --> 03:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
pharmacy board actually it it clears up
 
03:20:13.469 --> 03:20:13.479 align:start position:0%
some discrepancy because currently
 
03:20:14.710 --> 03:20:14.720 align:start position:0%
there's actually a little bit of
 
03:20:17.030 --> 03:20:17.040 align:start position:0%
discrepancy people were testifying at
 
03:20:18.510 --> 03:20:18.520 align:start position:0%
the Senate hearing that there were X
 
03:20:21.110 --> 03:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
number of uh people on the board and
 
03:20:23.309 --> 03:20:23.319 align:start position:0%
others said why so what it does is
 
03:20:24.830 --> 03:20:24.840 align:start position:0%
clarifies this and this is in
 
03:20:27.030 --> 03:20:27.040 align:start position:0%
conjunction with a number of folks who
 
03:20:29.070 --> 03:20:29.080 align:start position:0%
um agreed that this was the right number
 
03:20:30.910 --> 03:20:30.920 align:start position:0%
that it would include it would be seven
 
03:20:33.429 --> 03:20:33.439 align:start position:0%
members including five practicing
 
03:20:35.630 --> 03:20:35.640 align:start position:0%
pharmacists at least one of whom is a
 
03:20:37.950 --> 03:20:37.960 align:start position:0%
full-time Hospital pharmacist one
 
03:20:40.710 --> 03:20:40.720 align:start position:0%
pharmacy technician and one public
 
03:20:44.710 --> 03:20:44.720 align:start position:0%
member so um now you will also notice
 
03:20:46.590 --> 03:20:46.600 align:start position:0%
that the title of the bill says relative
 
03:20:48.550 --> 03:20:48.560 align:start position:0%
relative to Board of Pharmacy and
 
03:20:51.830 --> 03:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
certified public accountant
 
03:20:55.469 --> 03:20:55.479 align:start position:0%
examinations and um that was uh that was
 
03:20:58.349 --> 03:20:58.359 align:start position:0%
a second uh uh my colleague Senator
 
03:21:03.269 --> 03:21:03.279 align:start position:0%
Fenton brought that Amendment to the um
 
03:21:04.670 --> 03:21:04.680 align:start position:0%
there was actually a second hearing for
 
03:21:07.429 --> 03:21:07.439 align:start position:0%
a non- gerain Amendment so what uh he
 
03:21:09.990 --> 03:21:10.000 align:start position:0%
had um introduced the amendment at the
 
03:21:12.110 --> 03:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
request of the New Hampshire Board of
 
03:21:16.830 --> 03:21:16.840 align:start position:0%
accountancy and it is in relation to the
 
03:21:19.710 --> 03:21:19.720 align:start position:0%
um administration of exams uh by the
 
03:21:22.389 --> 03:21:22.399 align:start position:0%
national state boards of accountancy um
 
03:21:24.070 --> 03:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Board of accountancy
 
03:21:27.870 --> 03:21:27.880 align:start position:0%
is adopting a 30mon limit in its rules
 
03:21:29.150 --> 03:21:29.160 align:start position:0%
but there was an
 
03:21:33.349 --> 03:21:33.359 align:start position:0%
18month limit in statute so what it does
 
03:21:37.150 --> 03:21:37.160 align:start position:0%
is it requires that uh folks taking this
 
03:21:40.189 --> 03:21:40.199 align:start position:0%
exam have to pass all parts of the exam
 
03:21:43.590 --> 03:21:43.600 align:start position:0%
within the uh time that would be uh the
 
03:21:46.950 --> 03:21:46.960 align:start position:0%
specific time frame requirement would be
 
03:21:49.429 --> 03:21:49.439 align:start position:0%
taken from statute and adopted through
 
03:21:52.830 --> 03:21:52.840 align:start position:0%
rules of the board um that is the second
 
03:21:55.110 --> 03:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
part of this bill I hope that you will
 
03:21:58.590 --> 03:21:58.600 align:start position:0%
look favorably upon um both parts of the
 
03:22:02.550 --> 03:22:02.560 align:start position:0%
bill and I want to express that um my uh
 
03:22:04.630 --> 03:22:04.640 align:start position:0%
one of my constituents did come to the
 
03:22:07.070 --> 03:22:07.080 align:start position:0%
Senate hearing uh she was not able to
 
03:22:09.070 --> 03:22:09.080 align:start position:0%
come to this hearing she is in fact
 
03:22:11.349 --> 03:22:11.359 align:start position:0%
working but uh she spoke really
 
03:22:14.630 --> 03:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
passionately about how important the
 
03:22:18.030 --> 03:22:18.040 align:start position:0%
role of pharmacy technician is is and um
 
03:22:20.429 --> 03:22:20.439 align:start position:0%
she talked about how patient care is at
 
03:22:22.429 --> 03:22:22.439 align:start position:0%
the core of their profession and
 
03:22:25.830 --> 03:22:25.840 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy uh technicians interview
 
03:22:28.630 --> 03:22:28.640 align:start position:0%
patients for medication reconciliation
 
03:22:30.830 --> 03:22:30.840 align:start position:0%
they administer intravenous solutions
 
03:22:33.030 --> 03:22:33.040 align:start position:0%
they run fusion centers and they serve
 
03:22:35.309 --> 03:22:35.319 align:start position:0%
on Hospital committees she's passionate
 
03:22:37.790 --> 03:22:37.800 align:start position:0%
about her work she is a professional and
 
03:22:41.389 --> 03:22:41.399 align:start position:0%
she really um wants to uh make sure that
 
03:22:43.830 --> 03:22:43.840 align:start position:0%
the entire profession is recognized as
 
03:22:46.830 --> 03:22:46.840 align:start position:0%
such and accorded a place on the board
 
03:22:49.269 --> 03:22:49.279 align:start position:0%
so thank you for your test for your uh
 
03:22:51.349 --> 03:22:51.359 align:start position:0%
time and your consideration and I hope
 
03:22:53.910 --> 03:22:53.920 align:start position:0%
that you will um find in favor of this
 
03:22:56.110 --> 03:22:56.120 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you thank you for Testimony
 
03:22:58.750 --> 03:22:58.760 align:start position:0%
Senator any questions yes representative
 
03:23:01.910 --> 03:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
leus thank you it's um technical
 
03:23:03.990 --> 03:23:04.000 align:start position:0%
question and if you wanted to defer to
 
03:23:05.630 --> 03:23:05.640 align:start position:0%
director Courtney you just arrived
 
03:23:08.550 --> 03:23:08.560 align:start position:0%
that's fine and that's uh page one lines
 
03:23:12.189 --> 03:23:12.199 align:start position:0%
19 to 21 it says the pharmacy technician
 
03:23:13.590 --> 03:23:13.600 align:start position:0%
member of the board shall have been
 
03:23:17.349 --> 03:23:17.359 align:start position:0%
certified and it goes on um it is my
 
03:23:19.349 --> 03:23:19.359 align:start position:0%
understanding that relatively recently
 
03:23:21.189 --> 03:23:21.199 align:start position:0%
there was the addition in addition to
 
03:23:23.389 --> 03:23:23.399 align:start position:0%
pharmacy technicians being able to be
 
03:23:26.590 --> 03:23:26.600 align:start position:0%
certified uh there's also a license and
 
03:23:29.750 --> 03:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
my question is does this Lang would this
 
03:23:31.550 --> 03:23:31.560 align:start position:0%
language include Pharmacy and
 
03:23:34.189 --> 03:23:34.199 align:start position:0%
technicians that are licensed as well as
 
03:23:35.910 --> 03:23:35.920 align:start position:0%
ones that are certified as possible
 
03:23:37.429 --> 03:23:37.439 align:start position:0%
members on the
 
03:23:41.630 --> 03:23:41.640 align:start position:0%
board yes um it would include and and I
 
03:23:45.550 --> 03:23:45.560 align:start position:0%
can and certainly um if I am I'm missp
 
03:23:47.469 --> 03:23:47.479 align:start position:0%
speaking uh director Courtney can
 
03:23:49.030 --> 03:23:49.040 align:start position:0%
correct me but I believe that it does
 
03:23:51.110 --> 03:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
include them one of the issues is we do
 
03:23:53.710 --> 03:23:53.720 align:start position:0%
not have a number of those folks
 
03:23:55.469 --> 03:23:55.479 align:start position:0%
practicing here because as you know that
 
03:23:58.750 --> 03:23:58.760 align:start position:0%
is a new standard so we I thought you
 
03:24:00.469 --> 03:24:00.479 align:start position:0%
were going to ask me about the 10-year
 
03:24:02.990 --> 03:24:03.000 align:start position:0%
requirement because we did um bat that
 
03:24:05.670 --> 03:24:05.680 align:start position:0%
idea around we wondered if in fact maybe
 
03:24:08.590 --> 03:24:08.600 align:start position:0%
pharmacy technicians we would say uh
 
03:24:10.550 --> 03:24:10.560 align:start position:0%
five year at practicing for at least
 
03:24:13.790 --> 03:24:13.800 align:start position:0%
five years but um the standard is in
 
03:24:15.870 --> 03:24:15.880 align:start position:0%
line with the pharmacist practice for 10
 
03:24:18.630 --> 03:24:18.640 align:start position:0%
years we do have a number of Highly
 
03:24:20.349 --> 03:24:20.359 align:start position:0%
qualified pharmacy technicians who've
 
03:24:22.309 --> 03:24:22.319 align:start position:0%
been practicing in the state for 10
 
03:24:25.790 --> 03:24:25.800 align:start position:0%
years so we will we chose that we do not
 
03:24:28.590 --> 03:24:28.600 align:start position:0%
have a number of folks who are the um
 
03:24:29.990 --> 03:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
advanced practice
 
03:24:34.030 --> 03:24:34.040 align:start position:0%
folks uh followup followup so if you
 
03:24:37.150 --> 03:24:37.160 align:start position:0%
have somebody let's say they presumably
 
03:24:39.030 --> 03:24:39.040 align:start position:0%
they're certified and then they become
 
03:24:39.040 --> 03:24:40.590 align:start position:0%
they're certified and then they become
licensed

03:24:40.590 --> 03:24:40.600 align:start position:0%
licensed
 
03:24:43.870 --> 03:24:43.880 align:start position:0%
um then even though they're licensed if
 
03:24:45.349 --> 03:24:45.359 align:start position:0%
they're certified as well and they've
 
03:24:47.150 --> 03:24:47.160 align:start position:0%
been doing it for 10 years 5 Years in
 
03:24:48.670 --> 03:24:48.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire then presumably they'd be
 
03:24:51.910 --> 03:24:51.920 align:start position:0%
eligible is that correct yes okay thank
 
03:24:55.710 --> 03:24:55.720 align:start position:0%
you you're welcome any other
 
03:24:58.750 --> 03:24:58.760 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for very
 
03:25:09.070 --> 03:25:09.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:11.870 --> 03:25:11.880 align:start position:0%

03:25:46.550 --> 03:25:46.560 align:start position:0%
the president of the board
 
03:25:48.870 --> 03:25:48.880 align:start position:0%
in regards to the question if a licensed
 
03:25:50.269 --> 03:25:50.279 align:start position:0%
Advanced pharmacy technician could
 
03:25:53.030 --> 03:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
become quote a member of the board as it
 
03:25:56.429 --> 03:25:56.439 align:start position:0%
stands today it may be a problem because
 
03:25:59.229 --> 03:25:59.239 align:start position:0%
in order to become a licensed technician
 
03:26:01.990 --> 03:26:02.000 align:start position:0%
you only need to have 2,000 hours as a
 
03:26:04.469 --> 03:26:04.479 align:start position:0%
certified tech which is not 10 years so
 
03:26:06.750 --> 03:26:06.760 align:start position:0%
that could be problematic where all of a
 
03:26:08.710 --> 03:26:08.720 align:start position:0%
sudden we have somebody who actually has
 
03:26:11.429 --> 03:26:11.439 align:start position:0%
a higher standard of practice but is not
 
03:26:12.990 --> 03:26:13.000 align:start position:0%
eligible for the board based upon the
 
03:26:15.510 --> 03:26:15.520 align:start position:0%
way the laws written currently before
 
03:26:17.469 --> 03:26:17.479 align:start position:0%
you cuz they would not have a full 10
 
03:26:20.550 --> 03:26:20.560 align:start position:0%
years I would also think about when
 
03:26:23.389 --> 03:26:23.399 align:start position:0%
you're looking at a pool of candidates
 
03:26:25.469 --> 03:26:25.479 align:start position:0%
many technicians who are highly
 
03:26:27.429 --> 03:26:27.439 align:start position:0%
qualified and hav't practiced in the
 
03:26:31.070 --> 03:26:31.080 align:start position:0%
field for many years they're essential
 
03:26:33.750 --> 03:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
to the practice of Pharmacy they are
 
03:26:35.870 --> 03:26:35.880 align:start position:0%
critical to allowing us to do the work
 
03:26:39.990 --> 03:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
we have to do however the turnover rate
 
03:26:43.150 --> 03:26:43.160 align:start position:0%
is extremely high so therefore 10 years
 
03:26:45.590 --> 03:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
could be honorous to have somebody in
 
03:26:46.990 --> 03:26:47.000 align:start position:0%
the field for 10 10 years when it's more
 
03:26:49.229 --> 03:26:49.239 align:start position:0%
of a job versus a career I would say if
 
03:26:50.870 --> 03:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
you're looking at changing something
 
03:26:54.389 --> 03:26:54.399 align:start position:0%
maybe 5 years is more amable um I would
 
03:26:56.269 --> 03:26:56.279 align:start position:0%
also say two years in the state of New
 
03:26:58.550 --> 03:26:58.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um at that point in time if
 
03:26:59.990 --> 03:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
you want to look at the licensed
 
03:27:01.950 --> 03:27:01.960 align:start position:0%
technicians hopefully by the time this
 
03:27:03.870 --> 03:27:03.880 align:start position:0%
gets through we'll have a pull of
 
03:27:05.990 --> 03:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
candidates we can draw upon who our
 
03:27:07.110 --> 03:27:07.120 align:start position:0%
licensed as
 
03:27:09.910 --> 03:27:09.920 align:start position:0%
well I would ask the board to consider
 
03:27:12.670 --> 03:27:12.680 align:start position:0%
the effective date of this bill to move
 
03:27:15.469 --> 03:27:15.479 align:start position:0%
it out and the rationale to that is
 
03:27:19.070 --> 03:27:19.080 align:start position:0%
currently on the board there is a
 
03:27:21.150 --> 03:27:21.160 align:start position:0%
natural Evolution you cannot serve for
 
03:27:24.630 --> 03:27:24.640 align:start position:0%
more than two consecutive 5-year
 
03:27:27.870 --> 03:27:27.880 align:start position:0%
terms there is a individual on the board
 
03:27:30.030 --> 03:27:30.040 align:start position:0%
today who's going to come to the end of
 
03:27:33.070 --> 03:27:33.080 align:start position:0%
their second five-year term next
 
03:27:35.150 --> 03:27:35.160 align:start position:0%
September there's an individual on the
 
03:27:37.830 --> 03:27:37.840 align:start position:0%
board today who's in the first five-year
 
03:27:40.710 --> 03:27:40.720 align:start position:0%
term if this is effective in August to
 
03:27:43.189 --> 03:27:43.199 align:start position:0%
September they would not qualify for
 
03:27:45.389 --> 03:27:45.399 align:start position:0%
being on the board for the second
 
03:27:45.399 --> 03:27:46.710 align:start position:0%
being on the board for the second
opportunity

03:27:46.710 --> 03:27:46.720 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
03:27:48.670 --> 03:27:48.680 align:start position:0%
if we extend the effective date until
 
03:27:50.710 --> 03:27:50.720 align:start position:0%
January 1st
 
03:27:53.469 --> 03:27:53.479 align:start position:0%
2025 then would be effective in
 
03:27:56.269 --> 03:27:56.279 align:start position:0%
September when the natural cycle
 
03:27:58.189 --> 03:27:58.199 align:start position:0%
somebody coming off the board so we
 
03:28:00.510 --> 03:28:00.520 align:start position:0%
would not as a legislative body
 
03:28:03.830 --> 03:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
inadvertently take someone off the board
 
03:28:06.229 --> 03:28:06.239 align:start position:0%
that may not want to come off the board
 
03:28:08.910 --> 03:28:08.920 align:start position:0%
so I would say could we somehow make the
 
03:28:11.229 --> 03:28:11.239 align:start position:0%
effective data at least the beginning of
 
03:28:13.790 --> 03:28:13.800 align:start position:0%
the year January
 
03:28:17.469 --> 03:28:17.479 align:start position:0%
1st 2025
 
03:28:19.510 --> 03:28:19.520 align:start position:0%
in regards
 
03:28:22.830 --> 03:28:22.840 align:start position:0%
to the pharmacy technicians again there
 
03:28:24.670 --> 03:28:24.680 align:start position:0%
is the licensed Pharmacy technition it
 
03:28:27.030 --> 03:28:27.040 align:start position:0%
is just started we have our first
 
03:28:29.269 --> 03:28:29.279 align:start position:0%
individual who actually is first in the
 
03:28:30.670 --> 03:28:30.680 align:start position:0%
nation I'm kind of proud about that
 
03:28:33.189 --> 03:28:33.199 align:start position:0%
being from New Hampshire myself uh New
 
03:28:35.710 --> 03:28:35.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire leading the way um but we have
 
03:28:39.309 --> 03:28:39.319 align:start position:0%
a lot of interest in the field in the
 
03:28:41.309 --> 03:28:41.319 align:start position:0%
profession to have more licensed
 
03:28:43.550 --> 03:28:43.560 align:start position:0%
technicians and the rationale to why we
 
03:28:45.309 --> 03:28:45.319 align:start position:0%
have a licensed technician versus a
 
03:28:47.429 --> 03:28:47.439 align:start position:0%
certified technician
 
03:28:49.550 --> 03:28:49.560 align:start position:0%
as a licensed pharmacist if I have a
 
03:28:49.560 --> 03:28:50.550 align:start position:0%
as a licensed pharmacist if I have a
certified

03:28:50.550 --> 03:28:50.560 align:start position:0%
certified
 
03:28:52.950 --> 03:28:52.960 align:start position:0%
technician doing
 
03:28:56.550 --> 03:28:56.560 align:start position:0%
task and something happens
 
03:28:58.670 --> 03:28:58.680 align:start position:0%
inadvertently it never falls to the
 
03:29:01.550 --> 03:29:01.560 align:start position:0%
technician it's always on my license so
 
03:29:04.269 --> 03:29:04.279 align:start position:0%
therefore to break it apart to reduce
 
03:29:07.150 --> 03:29:07.160 align:start position:0%
the liability exposure of the pharmacist
 
03:29:08.630 --> 03:29:08.640 align:start position:0%
we created a licensed technition like
 
03:29:11.710 --> 03:29:11.720 align:start position:0%
you do an LPN under the RN so that they
 
03:29:13.269 --> 03:29:13.279 align:start position:0%
have their own distinct license and
 
03:29:16.110 --> 03:29:16.120 align:start position:0%
their own liability and also with that
 
03:29:19.349 --> 03:29:19.359 align:start position:0%
the training it goes to acquire it so it
 
03:29:21.469 --> 03:29:21.479 align:start position:0%
encouraged the bo this board or this
 
03:29:24.830 --> 03:29:24.840 align:start position:0%
committee to think about making a
 
03:29:26.990 --> 03:29:27.000 align:start position:0%
modification so that we can have
 
03:29:28.870 --> 03:29:28.880 align:start position:0%
licensed technicians on the board like
 
03:29:30.309 --> 03:29:30.319 align:start position:0%
we do licensed pharmacist I'll be
 
03:29:32.070 --> 03:29:32.080 align:start position:0%
willing to sit down with someone on the
 
03:29:33.830 --> 03:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
committee and write an
 
03:29:36.269 --> 03:29:36.279 align:start position:0%
amendment um to try to weave that
 
03:29:38.630 --> 03:29:38.640 align:start position:0%
through here and try to at that point in
 
03:29:39.750 --> 03:29:39.760 align:start position:0%
time bring something back to the
 
03:29:41.229 --> 03:29:41.239 align:start position:0%
committee or back to somebody on this
 
03:29:43.429 --> 03:29:43.439 align:start position:0%
committee and introduce an amendment
 
03:29:44.630 --> 03:29:44.640 align:start position:0%
through one of the members on the
 
03:29:44.640 --> 03:29:47.269 align:start position:0%
through one of the members on the
committee

03:29:47.269 --> 03:29:47.279 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:29:48.670 --> 03:29:48.680 align:start position:0%
thank you very much any questions yes
 
03:29:51.389 --> 03:29:51.399 align:start position:0%
representative Le related to the last
 
03:29:54.309 --> 03:29:54.319 align:start position:0%
question I asked and that is um for
 
03:29:57.189 --> 03:29:57.199 align:start position:0%
someone to be a licensed uh pharmacy
 
03:29:59.510 --> 03:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
technician do they also have to be
 
03:30:01.990 --> 03:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
certified yes they have to be certified
 
03:30:04.710 --> 03:30:04.720 align:start position:0%
and practicing for a minimum of 2,000
 
03:30:06.630 --> 03:30:06.640 align:start position:0%
hours which is basically a year follow
 
03:30:09.510 --> 03:30:09.520 align:start position:0%
up follow up then um wouldn't the
 
03:30:12.070 --> 03:30:12.080 align:start position:0%
language here that says uh to be a
 
03:30:13.870 --> 03:30:13.880 align:start position:0%
member of the board they shall be cert
 
03:30:16.030 --> 03:30:16.040 align:start position:0%
they have to be certified wouldn't that
 
03:30:18.550 --> 03:30:18.560 align:start position:0%
language be okay and apply both to
 
03:30:21.309 --> 03:30:21.319 align:start position:0%
certified and licensed pharmacy
 
03:30:23.110 --> 03:30:23.120 align:start position:0%
technicians if to be licensed they have
 
03:30:25.750 --> 03:30:25.760 align:start position:0%
to be certified the way it's written now
 
03:30:28.510 --> 03:30:28.520 align:start position:0%
it requires 10 years the licensed te
 
03:30:30.870 --> 03:30:30.880 align:start position:0%
only requires one year follow up follow
 
03:30:32.830 --> 03:30:32.840 align:start position:0%
no I'm not talking about the length of
 
03:30:37.070 --> 03:30:37.080 align:start position:0%
time but if if I understand correctly
 
03:30:40.750 --> 03:30:40.760 align:start position:0%
and if for a pharmacy TCH technician to
 
03:30:42.990 --> 03:30:43.000 align:start position:0%
be licensed they also have to be
 
03:30:46.269 --> 03:30:46.279 align:start position:0%
certified you know they're they're both
 
03:30:48.510 --> 03:30:48.520 align:start position:0%
then um I would think both the number of
 
03:30:50.910 --> 03:30:50.920 align:start position:0%
years and the presence on the board
 
03:30:53.030 --> 03:30:53.040 align:start position:0%
would be permitted for licensed or
 
03:30:55.510 --> 03:30:55.520 align:start position:0%
certified ones um given this language
 
03:30:56.790 --> 03:30:56.800 align:start position:0%
and it would not need to be changed
 
03:30:58.670 --> 03:30:58.680 align:start position:0%
other than the number of years is that
 
03:31:02.030 --> 03:31:02.040 align:start position:0%
am I incorrect or not the way I read it
 
03:31:04.510 --> 03:31:04.520 align:start position:0%
now in order to be candidate you have to
 
03:31:06.950 --> 03:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
have 10 years as a certified tech to be
 
03:31:09.590 --> 03:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
a licensed technician you only need one
 
03:31:12.030 --> 03:31:12.040 align:start position:0%
year so therefore if you become licensed
 
03:31:14.189 --> 03:31:14.199 align:start position:0%
as a technician after one year you don't
 
03:31:16.950 --> 03:31:16.960 align:start position:0%
have a full 10 years as a certified Tech
 
03:31:19.349 --> 03:31:19.359 align:start position:0%
just for clarification maybe I think I
 
03:31:21.389 --> 03:31:21.399 align:start position:0%
may be wrong on this but here's you
 
03:31:23.349 --> 03:31:23.359 align:start position:0%
don't have to go for lure is that cor do
 
03:31:24.710 --> 03:31:24.720 align:start position:0%
you have to go for license you can stay
 
03:31:26.389 --> 03:31:26.399 align:start position:0%
certified so the the point that you're
 
03:31:27.670 --> 03:31:27.680 align:start position:0%
making is that you could be 10 years
 
03:31:29.790 --> 03:31:29.800 align:start position:0%
certified and be on the board and have a
 
03:31:32.349 --> 03:31:32.359 align:start position:0%
lower credential than a licensed
 
03:31:34.429 --> 03:31:34.439 align:start position:0%
individual um because they can get it
 
03:31:36.189 --> 03:31:36.199 align:start position:0%
after one year but you could just be
 
03:31:37.870 --> 03:31:37.880 align:start position:0%
certified after 10 and be on the board
 
03:31:39.990 --> 03:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
and so you'd have a lower license lower
 
03:31:41.750 --> 03:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
credential person on to the chair if I
 
03:31:45.189 --> 03:31:45.199 align:start position:0%
could if we could uh ask if I could ask
 
03:31:47.189 --> 03:31:47.199 align:start position:0%
a question of Courtney when she comes up
 
03:31:49.189 --> 03:31:49.199 align:start position:0%
I might be able to clarify this thank
 
03:31:53.950 --> 03:31:53.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:57.630 --> 03:31:57.640 align:start position:0%
SMI thank you Mr chairman so
 
03:32:01.349 --> 03:32:01.359 align:start position:0%
representative um with all due
 
03:32:05.630 --> 03:32:05.640 align:start position:0%
respect it it seems to me that nobody
 
03:32:09.990 --> 03:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
knows uh better than uh pharmacists
 
03:32:14.189 --> 03:32:14.199 align:start position:0%
himself or herself um what the value uh
 
03:32:16.510 --> 03:32:16.520 align:start position:0%
and the importance of the pharmac
 
03:32:21.070 --> 03:32:21.080 align:start position:0%
Texas um you have to do is remember the
 
03:32:24.189 --> 03:32:24.199 align:start position:0%
um It's a Wonderful Life a great story
 
03:32:26.030 --> 03:32:26.040 align:start position:0%
of the worker
 
03:32:28.630 --> 03:32:28.640 align:start position:0%
who discovers the mistake the pharmacist
 
03:32:28.640 --> 03:32:29.349 align:start position:0%
who discovers the mistake the pharmacist
has

03:32:29.349 --> 03:32:29.359 align:start position:0%
has
 
03:32:33.189 --> 03:32:33.199 align:start position:0%
made um but anyway bottom line is why do
 
03:32:35.670 --> 03:32:35.680 align:start position:0%
you need an extra person on the
 
03:32:39.269 --> 03:32:39.279 align:start position:0%
board uh pharmacists don't take care of
 
03:32:43.790 --> 03:32:43.800 align:start position:0%
the pharmacy text we do but if I may
 
03:32:47.510 --> 03:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
chman we do I would say the real value
 
03:32:50.429 --> 03:32:50.439 align:start position:0%
of the board or any board is a very
 
03:32:53.830 --> 03:32:53.840 align:start position:0%
diverse body because everyone brings a
 
03:32:57.269 --> 03:32:57.279 align:start position:0%
different set of lens to the discussion
 
03:32:58.790 --> 03:32:58.800 align:start position:0%
so when we're talking about things now
 
03:33:00.030 --> 03:33:00.040 align:start position:0%
with a licensed
 
03:33:02.150 --> 03:33:02.160 align:start position:0%
technician when certified they don't
 
03:33:04.269 --> 03:33:04.279 align:start position:0%
come before the board for disciplinary
 
03:33:06.710 --> 03:33:06.720 align:start position:0%
actions a licensed technician will come
 
03:33:09.110 --> 03:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
before the board so having a licensed
 
03:33:11.950 --> 03:33:11.960 align:start position:0%
technician on that board Who Walks In
 
03:33:14.630 --> 03:33:14.640 align:start position:0%
Those Shoes helping that discussion with
 
03:33:15.870 --> 03:33:15.880 align:start position:0%
the board I think is going to be
 
03:33:18.349 --> 03:33:18.359 align:start position:0%
incredibly important and that's why I'm
 
03:33:19.990 --> 03:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
really advocating more for the licensed
 
03:33:22.750 --> 03:33:22.760 align:start position:0%
technician versus a certified technician
 
03:33:24.910 --> 03:33:24.920 align:start position:0%
because the roles they play are
 
03:33:24.920 --> 03:33:26.389 align:start position:0%
because the roles they play are
fundamentally

03:33:26.389 --> 03:33:26.399 align:start position:0%
fundamentally
 
03:33:28.830 --> 03:33:28.840 align:start position:0%
different so back to your question is I
 
03:33:30.189 --> 03:33:30.199 align:start position:0%
think it's really important for any
 
03:33:33.630 --> 03:33:33.640 align:start position:0%
board to be as diverse as possible so
 
03:33:35.309 --> 03:33:35.319 align:start position:0%
that when something becomes before the
 
03:33:38.030 --> 03:33:38.040 align:start position:0%
board there somebody on the board who
 
03:33:40.469 --> 03:33:40.479 align:start position:0%
can bring that background that
 
03:33:42.910 --> 03:33:42.920 align:start position:0%
experience that robustness to that
 
03:33:42.920 --> 03:33:46.910 align:start position:0%
experience that robustness to that
discussion

03:33:46.910 --> 03:33:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:50.950 --> 03:33:50.960 align:start position:0%
okay good representative gold thank you
 
03:33:52.830 --> 03:33:52.840 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
03:33:56.590 --> 03:33:56.600 align:start position:0%
question um so and I don't know if this
 
03:33:58.269 --> 03:33:58.279 align:start position:0%
needs to go to subcommittee I don't want
 
03:34:00.070 --> 03:34:00.080 align:start position:0%
to waste a lot of time on this but my
 
03:34:02.590 --> 03:34:02.600 align:start position:0%
question has to do with difference
 
03:34:05.990 --> 03:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
between certified and
 
03:34:08.710 --> 03:34:08.720 align:start position:0%
licensed uh kind of following up on that
 
03:34:11.790 --> 03:34:11.800 align:start position:0%
greater credential comment that was made
 
03:34:14.389 --> 03:34:14.399 align:start position:0%
earlier can you say that briefly or do
 
03:34:17.309 --> 03:34:17.319 align:start position:0%
we need more time no it's
 
03:34:19.389 --> 03:34:19.399 align:start position:0%
basically there are three levels of
 
03:34:21.389 --> 03:34:21.399 align:start position:0%
technicians in the pharmacy World there
 
03:34:22.950 --> 03:34:22.960 align:start position:0%
somebody who's registered as a
 
03:34:25.030 --> 03:34:25.040 align:start position:0%
technician and that's there so he can
 
03:34:26.670 --> 03:34:26.680 align:start position:0%
track what's going on to with diversion
 
03:34:29.150 --> 03:34:29.160 align:start position:0%
of control drugs there's a certified
 
03:34:30.950 --> 03:34:30.960 align:start position:0%
tech who goes through a certification
 
03:34:33.030 --> 03:34:33.040 align:start position:0%
process and there also a licensed
 
03:34:35.070 --> 03:34:35.080 align:start position:0%
technician the licensed technician is
 
03:34:37.110 --> 03:34:37.120 align:start position:0%
the highest level and they have a
 
03:34:39.189 --> 03:34:39.199 align:start position:0%
discrete license of their own unlike
 
03:34:43.670 --> 03:34:43.680 align:start position:0%
everyone else and as a license holder
 
03:34:45.229 --> 03:34:45.239 align:start position:0%
they are therefore accountable to the
 
03:34:47.670 --> 03:34:47.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Board of Pharmacy certified
 
03:34:49.510 --> 03:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
technicians per se have some
 
03:34:51.309 --> 03:34:51.319 align:start position:0%
accountability but the certification is
 
03:34:52.590 --> 03:34:52.600 align:start position:0%
not held by the state of New Hampshire
 
03:34:54.070 --> 03:34:54.080 align:start position:0%
it's held by a National Organization so
 
03:34:55.469 --> 03:34:55.479 align:start position:0%
we cannot pull their
 
03:34:58.070 --> 03:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
certification okay a license on the
 
03:35:00.550 --> 03:35:00.560 align:start position:0%
other hand issued by the state the state
 
03:35:02.870 --> 03:35:02.880 align:start position:0%
can pull that license but we cannot pull
 
03:35:02.880 --> 03:35:04.309 align:start position:0%
can pull that license but we cannot pull
the

03:35:04.309 --> 03:35:04.319 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:35:07.389 --> 03:35:07.399 align:start position:0%
certification follow up and so is there
 
03:35:10.229 --> 03:35:10.239 align:start position:0%
a longer training period or more
 
03:35:12.950 --> 03:35:12.960 align:start position:0%
education like what gives the
 
03:35:15.189 --> 03:35:15.199 align:start position:0%
licensed uh technician the higher
 
03:35:17.790 --> 03:35:17.800 align:start position:0%
credential then besides the fact the
 
03:35:20.950 --> 03:35:20.960 align:start position:0%
state has some control over it good
 
03:35:22.870 --> 03:35:22.880 align:start position:0%
question they have to work as a
 
03:35:24.950 --> 03:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
certified tech for at least 2,000 hours
 
03:35:26.630 --> 03:35:26.640 align:start position:0%
they have to pass the law basically the
 
03:35:28.670 --> 03:35:28.680 align:start position:0%
same law exam the pharmacist has to pass
 
03:35:30.070 --> 03:35:30.080 align:start position:0%
they have to go through educational
 
03:35:32.790 --> 03:35:32.800 align:start position:0%
training above and beyond that so
 
03:35:34.349 --> 03:35:34.359 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of requirements that were
 
03:35:36.790 --> 03:35:36.800 align:start position:0%
put into place in order to ensure that
 
03:35:38.990 --> 03:35:39.000 align:start position:0%
once they get the license they can do it
 
03:35:41.110 --> 03:35:41.120 align:start position:0%
safely and effectively
 
03:35:45.030 --> 03:35:45.040 align:start position:0%
y yes representative leus um given how
 
03:35:46.590 --> 03:35:46.600 align:start position:0%
much we're behind mind if this is going
 
03:35:49.830 --> 03:35:49.840 align:start position:0%
to go to subcommittee if uh Madam not
 
03:35:53.269 --> 03:35:53.279 align:start position:0%
chair at the moment uh can let us know I
 
03:35:55.349 --> 03:35:55.359 align:start position:0%
will defer any of my further questions
 
03:35:56.790 --> 03:35:56.800 align:start position:0%
to try and straighten out my
 
03:36:00.189 --> 03:36:00.199 align:start position:0%
understanding until then okay sounds
 
03:36:01.630 --> 03:36:01.640 align:start position:0%
like there's
 
03:36:04.110 --> 03:36:04.120 align:start position:0%
questions thank
 
03:36:06.229 --> 03:36:06.239 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative I
 
03:36:07.670 --> 03:36:07.680 align:start position:0%
appreciate it yeah that that should be
 
03:36:10.870 --> 03:36:10.880 align:start position:0%
it thank you unless you want to join the
 
03:36:14.229 --> 03:36:14.239 align:start position:0%
subcommitte thank you thank you will I
 
03:36:16.030 --> 03:36:16.040 align:start position:0%
will try to make myself a ailable to the
 
03:36:17.550 --> 03:36:17.560 align:start position:0%
subcommittee to try to answer some of
 
03:36:19.870 --> 03:36:19.880 align:start position:0%
his questions uh the other one also
 
03:36:21.189 --> 03:36:21.199 align:start position:0%
could probably help out is
 
03:36:23.550 --> 03:36:23.560 align:start position:0%
representative roord um who also a
 
03:36:24.830 --> 03:36:24.840 align:start position:0%
serves on this Pharmacy board we're
 
03:36:27.269 --> 03:36:27.279 align:start position:0%
trying to be sure whatever we do we do
 
03:36:31.229 --> 03:36:31.239 align:start position:0%
correctly long term great thank you very
 
03:36:33.950 --> 03:36:33.960 align:start position:0%
much does anybody else wish to testify
 
03:36:35.910 --> 03:36:35.920 align:start position:0%
on S
 
03:36:39.269 --> 03:36:39.279 align:start position:0%
sp600 uh director
 
03:36:41.710 --> 03:36:41.720 align:start position:0%
Courtney question of the chair is there
 
03:36:44.229 --> 03:36:44.239 align:start position:0%
somebody here that with a pink card with
 
03:36:46.790 --> 03:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
regard to the pharmacy as far the
 
03:36:50.070 --> 03:36:50.080 align:start position:0%
accountancy board no there's issue thank
 
03:36:52.630 --> 03:36:52.640 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chair I'm members of
 
03:36:53.990 --> 03:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
the committee Lindsay Courtney executive
 
03:36:56.389 --> 03:36:56.399 align:start position:0%
director oplc I'll be very brief I know
 
03:36:58.950 --> 03:36:58.960 align:start position:0%
this is uh likely to go to subcommittee
 
03:37:00.550 --> 03:37:00.560 align:start position:0%
um the office is not taking a position
 
03:37:02.790 --> 03:37:02.800 align:start position:0%
on the bill but I do think it's
 
03:37:05.750 --> 03:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
important that um the Board of Pharmacy
 
03:37:07.830 --> 03:37:07.840 align:start position:0%
be essentially be reconstituted in
 
03:37:10.469 --> 03:37:10.479 align:start position:0%
statute um because there were
 
03:37:12.710 --> 03:37:12.720 align:start position:0%
essentially three changes to the
 
03:37:14.830 --> 03:37:14.840 align:start position:0%
pharmacy board composition last session
 
03:37:17.510 --> 03:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
and there was a dispute currently um
 
03:37:19.990 --> 03:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
internally uh with both the Department
 
03:37:21.349 --> 03:37:21.359 align:start position:0%
of Justice and the Secretary of State as
 
03:37:22.510 --> 03:37:22.520 align:start position:0%
to how many people are on the Board of
 
03:37:25.469 --> 03:37:25.479 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy so um I think in order to
 
03:37:28.269 --> 03:37:28.279 align:start position:0%
clarify that uh there needs to be a
 
03:37:31.550 --> 03:37:31.560 align:start position:0%
statutory change uh confirming that it's
 
03:37:34.349 --> 03:37:34.359 align:start position:0%
either five or confirming that it's
 
03:37:36.269 --> 03:37:36.279 align:start position:0%
seven which is currently opl C's
 
03:37:37.950 --> 03:37:37.960 align:start position:0%
position and the department of Justice's
 
03:37:40.750 --> 03:37:40.760 align:start position:0%
position um so that we we know precisely
 
03:37:43.030 --> 03:37:43.040 align:start position:0%
who has to be on the board um I think
 
03:37:44.950 --> 03:37:44.960 align:start position:0%
representative leas uh there are some
 
03:37:48.110 --> 03:37:48.120 align:start position:0%
there might be some confusion um there's
 
03:37:50.670 --> 03:37:50.680 align:start position:0%
so to be an advanced a licens advanced
 
03:37:52.950 --> 03:37:52.960 align:start position:0%
pharmacy technician you do have to have
 
03:37:54.990 --> 03:37:55.000 align:start position:0%
your certification for one year but you
 
03:37:56.510 --> 03:37:56.520 align:start position:0%
don't need to maintain it so you don't
 
03:37:59.469 --> 03:37:59.479 align:start position:0%
need to maintain it concurrently um so I
 
03:38:02.469 --> 03:38:02.479 align:start position:0%
think that hopefully maybe that clears
 
03:38:05.189 --> 03:38:05.199 align:start position:0%
up a little bit there are three types of
 
03:38:07.750 --> 03:38:07.760 align:start position:0%
certification or three types of licenses
 
03:38:09.030 --> 03:38:09.040 align:start position:0%
under the Board of Pharmacy as it
 
03:38:11.830 --> 03:38:11.840 align:start position:0%
relates to pharmacy technicians one is
 
03:38:14.510 --> 03:38:14.520 align:start position:0%
called a a registered pharmacist or
 
03:38:16.910 --> 03:38:16.920 align:start position:0%
pharmacy technician it's a registry
 
03:38:18.710 --> 03:38:18.720 align:start position:0%
because there are no requirements other
 
03:38:20.710 --> 03:38:20.720 align:start position:0%
than you be a certain age and we put you
 
03:38:22.950 --> 03:38:22.960 align:start position:0%
on the registry under the administrative
 
03:38:24.510 --> 03:38:24.520 align:start position:0%
procedures act it's still considered a
 
03:38:26.389 --> 03:38:26.399 align:start position:0%
license so you still need to do process
 
03:38:27.950 --> 03:38:27.960 align:start position:0%
if we're going to discipline you the
 
03:38:29.790 --> 03:38:29.800 align:start position:0%
same is true with respect to
 
03:38:32.030 --> 03:38:32.040 align:start position:0%
certification certification requires a
 
03:38:34.269 --> 03:38:34.279 align:start position:0%
national certification we call it a
 
03:38:35.830 --> 03:38:35.840 align:start position:0%
certification in New Hampshire but it's
 
03:38:38.110 --> 03:38:38.120 align:start position:0%
still considered a license um that can
 
03:38:40.189 --> 03:38:40.199 align:start position:0%
be subject to revocation after notice
 
03:38:41.670 --> 03:38:41.680 align:start position:0%
and opportunity to be heard and then
 
03:38:43.710 --> 03:38:43.720 align:start position:0%
there's the license Advanced pharmacy
 
03:38:46.110 --> 03:38:46.120 align:start position:0%
technician so as as the bill is
 
03:38:47.750 --> 03:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
currently drafted in order to be
 
03:38:49.830 --> 03:38:49.840 align:start position:0%
eligible you would have to be in the
 
03:38:52.710 --> 03:38:52.720 align:start position:0%
middle tier Certified Pharmacy
 
03:38:56.630 --> 03:38:56.640 align:start position:0%
Technician um you could theoretically be
 
03:38:59.389 --> 03:38:59.399 align:start position:0%
an advanced pharmacy technician if you
 
03:39:02.349 --> 03:39:02.359 align:start position:0%
otherwise satisfy that requirement that
 
03:39:04.910 --> 03:39:04.920 align:start position:0%
you have served um as a Certified
 
03:39:06.630 --> 03:39:06.640 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy Technician for 10
 
03:39:08.910 --> 03:39:08.920 align:start position:0%
years I'm happy to make myself available
 
03:39:10.910 --> 03:39:10.920 align:start position:0%
at subcommitte and work with anybody to
 
03:39:12.790 --> 03:39:12.800 align:start position:0%

House Bill 4 AV I'm introducing it as a
 
03:40:20.910 --> 03:40:20.920 align:start position:0%
um as a favor to Senator Carson who has
 
03:40:23.469 --> 03:40:23.479 align:start position:0%
had a different U Bill to introduce
 
03:40:23.479 --> 03:40:24.550 align:start position:0%
had a different U Bill to introduce
elsewhere

03:40:24.550 --> 03:40:24.560 align:start position:0%
elsewhere
 
03:40:28.070 --> 03:40:28.080 align:start position:0%
today and I don't know anything about it
 
03:40:29.670 --> 03:40:29.680 align:start position:0%
that you don't know from reading the
 
03:40:32.990 --> 03:40:33.000 align:start position:0%
bill so I will not take any
 
03:40:36.590 --> 03:40:36.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:40.150 --> 03:40:40.160 align:start position:0%
much uh I'd like to call Rob uh Bob
 
03:40:47.189 --> 03:40:47.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:48.389 --> 03:40:48.399 align:start position:0%
we can hopefully give us a little bit
 
03:40:48.399 --> 03:40:52.389 align:start position:0%
we can hopefully give us a little bit
more

03:40:52.389 --> 03:40:52.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:54.750 --> 03:40:54.760 align:start position:0%
information good afternoon my name is
 
03:40:56.150 --> 03:40:56.160 align:start position:0%
Bob Quinn I'm the CEO of the New
 
03:40:58.349 --> 03:40:58.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Association of Realtors and
 
03:41:00.309 --> 03:41:00.319 align:start position:0%
I'm Joanie McIntyre I'm the president of
 
03:41:01.990 --> 03:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Association of
 
03:41:04.630 --> 03:41:04.640 align:start position:0%
Realtors so I'm going to give a quick
 
03:41:06.110 --> 03:41:06.120 align:start position:0%
synopsis of the first section of the
 
03:41:08.030 --> 03:41:08.040 align:start position:0%
bill and then Joanie will talk about the
 
03:41:12.070 --> 03:41:12.080 align:start position:0%
remainder um so section one uh has to do
 
03:41:14.870 --> 03:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
with it doesn't specifically pertain to
 
03:41:17.229 --> 03:41:17.239 align:start position:0%
the Real Estate Commission but rather
 
03:41:19.750 --> 03:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
any uh border commission who has active
 
03:41:22.710 --> 03:41:22.720 align:start position:0%
lienes that exceed 7,000 would have
 
03:41:24.590 --> 03:41:24.600 align:start position:0%
their own dedicated customer service
 
03:41:27.349 --> 03:41:27.359 align:start position:0%
administrator so the real estate I think
 
03:41:29.830 --> 03:41:29.840 align:start position:0%
they're about 10,000 um real estate
 
03:41:33.349 --> 03:41:33.359 align:start position:0%
licenses in the state the Real Estate
 
03:41:35.750 --> 03:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
Commission up until a couple years ago
 
03:41:39.110 --> 03:41:39.120 align:start position:0%
had its own executive director um so it
 
03:41:42.389 --> 03:41:42.399 align:start position:0%
was somebody who all lenses sort of knew
 
03:41:45.309 --> 03:41:45.319 align:start position:0%
who they were could call email have have
 
03:41:46.790 --> 03:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
a Communications back and forth if they
 
03:41:49.229 --> 03:41:49.239 align:start position:0%
had any questions few years ago I think
 
03:41:51.950 --> 03:41:51.960 align:start position:0%
that that executive director position
 
03:41:53.990 --> 03:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
morphed a little bit and they started to
 
03:41:55.750 --> 03:41:55.760 align:start position:0%
oversee some other smaller boards as
 
03:41:59.070 --> 03:41:59.080 align:start position:0%
well um so but what this bill would do
 
03:42:01.429 --> 03:42:01.439 align:start position:0%
would basically require the oplc to have
 
03:42:03.469 --> 03:42:03.479 align:start position:0%
a specific individual not an executive
 
03:42:04.910 --> 03:42:04.920 align:start position:0%
director but someone who could handle
 
03:42:08.110 --> 03:42:08.120 align:start position:0%
customer service um obviously there have
 
03:42:10.710 --> 03:42:10.720 align:start position:0%
been as things have sort of changed a
 
03:42:13.510 --> 03:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
little bit sometimes in in uh rules and
 
03:42:15.830 --> 03:42:15.840 align:start position:0%
statute um lenses have a number of
 
03:42:18.309 --> 03:42:18.319 align:start position:0%
questions that they're looking um for
 
03:42:19.750 --> 03:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
the real estate for the Real Estate
 
03:42:22.750 --> 03:42:22.760 align:start position:0%
Commission oplc to answer in the past
 
03:42:25.189 --> 03:42:25.199 align:start position:0%
maybe a year ago uh and I can vouch that
 
03:42:27.070 --> 03:42:27.080 align:start position:0%
this was the case uh you might call over
 
03:42:28.870 --> 03:42:28.880 align:start position:0%
the oplc and you would be on hold for 20
 
03:42:32.389 --> 03:42:32.399 align:start position:0%
minutes or so um that has improved uh
 
03:42:35.189 --> 03:42:35.199 align:start position:0%
and uh we have had lot of conversations
 
03:42:38.510 --> 03:42:38.520 align:start position:0%
and director Courtney has uh always been
 
03:42:40.750 --> 03:42:40.760 align:start position:0%
available to speak with the association
 
03:42:42.950 --> 03:42:42.960 align:start position:0%
about some of our concerns uh and has
 
03:42:45.429 --> 03:42:45.439 align:start position:0%
worked with us uh to try and resolve
 
03:42:48.510 --> 03:42:48.520 align:start position:0%
some of these issues um so this bill
 
03:42:51.830 --> 03:42:51.840 align:start position:0%
does not um appropriate any General
 
03:42:54.389 --> 03:42:54.399 align:start position:0%
Revenue funds for these positions so it
 
03:42:56.550 --> 03:42:56.560 align:start position:0%
would require either a transfer of
 
03:42:59.189 --> 03:42:59.199 align:start position:0%
existing U Personnel into these
 
03:43:02.550 --> 03:43:02.560 align:start position:0%
positions or as we potentially had
 
03:43:05.550 --> 03:43:05.560 align:start position:0%
envisioned um it may require a border
 
03:43:08.710 --> 03:43:08.720 align:start position:0%
commission to fund in essence through
 
03:43:10.990 --> 03:43:11.000 align:start position:0%
fees since that's where oplc gets its
 
03:43:14.550 --> 03:43:14.560 align:start position:0%
Revenue most of its revenue from so in
 
03:43:16.070 --> 03:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
the conversation ations and in fact
 
03:43:18.830 --> 03:43:18.840 align:start position:0%
during the Senate uh discussions as well
 
03:43:20.830 --> 03:43:20.840 align:start position:0%
um we had suggested a potential
 
03:43:22.790 --> 03:43:22.800 align:start position:0%
Amendment um that I'm happy to
 
03:43:25.229 --> 03:43:25.239 align:start position:0%
distribute here and we also had rified
 
03:43:27.670 --> 03:43:27.680 align:start position:0%
the oplc um and I don't want to speak
 
03:43:29.429 --> 03:43:29.439 align:start position:0%
for them but I think they were okay with
 
03:43:32.870 --> 03:43:32.880 align:start position:0%
it um where it basically Alters language
 
03:43:36.229 --> 03:43:36.239 align:start position:0%
a little bit where it says that the oplc
 
03:43:39.149 --> 03:43:39.159 align:start position:0%
with those boards over 7,000 shall
 
03:43:41.590 --> 03:43:41.600 align:start position:0%
consult with the boards and commissions
 
03:43:44.030 --> 03:43:44.040 align:start position:0%
and then may assign a dedicated customer
 
03:43:45.750 --> 03:43:45.760 align:start position:0%
service administrator with the idea
 
03:43:47.349 --> 03:43:47.359 align:start position:0%
being that maybe not all boards or
 
03:43:49.830 --> 03:43:49.840 align:start position:0%
commissions would want to see uh
 
03:43:51.590 --> 03:43:51.600 align:start position:0%
potentially fees increase in order to
 
03:43:53.189 --> 03:43:53.199 align:start position:0%
guarantee that there was a a customer
 
03:43:55.429 --> 03:43:55.439 align:start position:0%
service individual specifically assigned
 
03:43:59.309 --> 03:43:59.319 align:start position:0%
to that U to that board of commission um
 
03:44:01.870 --> 03:44:01.880 align:start position:0%
so and and it also makes it clear that
 
03:44:04.149 --> 03:44:04.159 align:start position:0%
if that's the case that individual could
 
03:44:06.550 --> 03:44:06.560 align:start position:0%
in fact oversee more than just one Board
 
03:44:08.309 --> 03:44:08.319 align:start position:0%
of commission they might have two or
 
03:44:10.950 --> 03:44:10.960 align:start position:0%
three um so I'm happy to distribute that
 
03:44:13.590 --> 03:44:13.600 align:start position:0%
if there's interest in that uh and then
 
03:44:17.309 --> 03:44:17.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:20.590 --> 03:44:20.600 align:start position:0%
um so in paragraph two uh the addition
 
03:44:25.830 --> 03:44:25.840 align:start position:0%
of 7A um discussing post Licensing in
 
03:44:29.550 --> 03:44:29.560 align:start position:0%
2018 um legislation uh s SP
 
03:44:32.910 --> 03:44:32.920 align:start position:0%
461 was sponsored by Senator Carson and
 
03:44:35.870 --> 03:44:35.880 align:start position:0%
it would alter continuing education in a
 
03:44:39.750 --> 03:44:39.760 align:start position:0%
way that um during the initial period of
 
03:44:42.630 --> 03:44:42.640 align:start position:0%
a lensey that first two years they would
 
03:44:46.269 --> 03:44:46.279 align:start position:0%
take 12 specific courses um that would
 
03:44:48.510 --> 03:44:48.520 align:start position:0%
really help them be better Realtors um
 
03:44:52.630 --> 03:44:52.640 align:start position:0%
things about contracts and and um
 
03:44:54.950 --> 03:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
closings and that type of thing um not
 
03:44:58.070 --> 03:44:58.080 align:start position:0%
fluff classes um the intent was to make
 
03:45:00.469 --> 03:45:00.479 align:start position:0%
sure that they had those basic skills
 
03:45:05.389 --> 03:45:05.399 align:start position:0%
and um the uh the Real Estate Commission
 
03:45:08.189 --> 03:45:08.199 align:start position:0%
pregated that rule and approved the
 
03:45:10.990 --> 03:45:11.000 align:start position:0%
courses that would be um that would be
 
03:45:14.070 --> 03:45:14.080 align:start position:0%
required for that first initial um
 
03:45:18.149 --> 03:45:18.159 align:start position:0%
licensing um it went into effect in
 
03:45:23.030 --> 03:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
2022 2022 and the oplc um late in the
 
03:45:26.469 --> 03:45:26.479 align:start position:0%
year um said that they didn't understand
 
03:45:28.349 --> 03:45:28.359 align:start position:0%
the post licensing what that meant it
 
03:45:33.590 --> 03:45:33.600 align:start position:0%
wasn't in the statute um and so this um
 
03:45:37.110 --> 03:45:37.120 align:start position:0%
legislation this piece this change will
 
03:45:41.309 --> 03:45:41.319 align:start position:0%
Define that post licensing that 2year um
 
03:45:45.269 --> 03:45:45.279 align:start position:0%
period after their before their fish for
 
03:45:47.710 --> 03:45:47.720 align:start position:0%
their um initial
 
03:45:51.349 --> 03:45:51.359 align:start position:0%
renewal um in section three this has to
 
03:45:56.710 --> 03:45:56.720 align:start position:0%
do with um inactive status so in um when
 
03:45:59.309 --> 03:45:59.319 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 was passed last year we
 
03:46:03.030 --> 03:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
believe it was this was inadvertently um
 
03:46:06.269 --> 03:46:06.279 align:start position:0%
deleted of what constitutes inactive
 
03:46:09.830 --> 03:46:09.840 align:start position:0%
status um in real real estate is
 
03:46:13.189 --> 03:46:13.199 align:start position:0%
uniquely real estate is likely unique
 
03:46:15.750 --> 03:46:15.760 align:start position:0%
among professions in AOW owing for an
 
03:46:19.510 --> 03:46:19.520 align:start position:0%
inactive licens status um hb2
 
03:46:21.710 --> 03:46:21.720 align:start position:0%
transferred various statute authorities
 
03:46:26.750 --> 03:46:26.760 align:start position:0%
to oplc in RSA 310 however the statute
 
03:46:30.269 --> 03:46:30.279 align:start position:0%
makes no mention of inactive status
 
03:46:32.630 --> 03:46:32.640 align:start position:0%
we've discussed this with oplc and we
 
03:46:35.030 --> 03:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
would defer to them how with any of
 
03:46:35.950 --> 03:46:35.960 align:start position:0%
their new
 
03:46:38.309 --> 03:46:38.319 align:start position:0%
enforcement um the removal of this
 
03:46:40.229 --> 03:46:40.239 align:start position:0%
statute creates a number of problems
 
03:46:43.429 --> 03:46:43.439 align:start position:0%
which include allowing a lensey to be
 
03:46:45.269 --> 03:46:45.279 align:start position:0%
compensated for activities they are
 
03:46:48.189 --> 03:46:48.199 align:start position:0%
involved in prior to going
 
03:46:53.550 --> 03:46:53.560 align:start position:0%
inactive and then section four has to do
 
03:46:53.560 --> 03:46:54.950 align:start position:0%
inactive and then section four has to do
with

03:46:54.950 --> 03:46:54.960 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:46:59.670 --> 03:46:59.680 align:start position:0%
um the uh I guess added the commission
 
03:47:02.510 --> 03:47:02.520 align:start position:0%
may approve prepar Preparatory
 
03:47:05.309 --> 03:47:05.319 align:start position:0%
continuing and instructor education
 
03:47:08.630 --> 03:47:08.640 align:start position:0%
programs of study with a single
 
03:47:11.750 --> 03:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
application so section four allows for
 
03:47:14.510 --> 03:47:14.520 align:start position:0%
the oplc to approve CES and other
 
03:47:14.520 --> 03:47:15.790 align:start position:0%
the oplc to approve CES and other
courses

03:47:15.790 --> 03:47:15.800 align:start position:0%
courses
 
03:47:18.429 --> 03:47:18.439 align:start position:0%
there had been issues where the oplc did
 
03:47:22.149 --> 03:47:22.159 align:start position:0%
not feel comfortable um approving these
 
03:47:24.189 --> 03:47:24.199 align:start position:0%
courses and pass them on to the Real
 
03:47:25.790 --> 03:47:25.800 align:start position:0%
Estate Commission the Real Estate
 
03:47:27.870 --> 03:47:27.880 align:start position:0%
Commission in some cases it was is too
 
03:47:30.030 --> 03:47:30.040 align:start position:0%
large and they didn't feel that they
 
03:47:34.590 --> 03:47:34.600 align:start position:0%
were um they had the material to do this
 
03:47:37.429 --> 03:47:37.439 align:start position:0%
so they were unable to to handle that
 
03:47:40.510 --> 03:47:40.520 align:start position:0%
responsibility um it led to no courses
 
03:47:42.750 --> 03:47:42.760 align:start position:0%
being approved for about six months you
 
03:47:45.550 --> 03:47:45.560 align:start position:0%
can see the the problem with that oplc
 
03:47:47.670 --> 03:47:47.680 align:start position:0%
um uh ultimately issued an order
 
03:47:50.710 --> 03:47:50.720 align:start position:0%
allowing them to review the courses um
 
03:47:53.429 --> 03:47:53.439 align:start position:0%
this section simply puts that Authority
 
03:47:56.590 --> 03:47:56.600 align:start position:0%
into statute the language also allows
 
03:47:59.389 --> 03:47:59.399 align:start position:0%
for the courses and the instructor
 
03:48:02.149 --> 03:48:02.159 align:start position:0%
approvals to occur with a single
 
03:48:04.750 --> 03:48:04.760 align:start position:0%
application as opposed to having to
 
03:48:08.149 --> 03:48:08.159 align:start position:0%
submit the the course and the the um
 
03:48:08.159 --> 03:48:11.349 align:start position:0%
submit the the course and the the um
instructor

03:48:11.349 --> 03:48:11.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:13.309 --> 03:48:13.319 align:start position:0%
separately great thank you for your
 
03:48:15.750 --> 03:48:15.760 align:start position:0%
testimony representative l
 
03:48:18.750 --> 03:48:18.760 align:start position:0%
thank you um so in this last part if I
 
03:48:20.269 --> 03:48:20.279 align:start position:0%
understood you correctly which I may not
 
03:48:23.510 --> 03:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
have um I think you said that the
 
03:48:26.389 --> 03:48:26.399 align:start position:0%
commission didn't feel that it could
 
03:48:28.670 --> 03:48:28.680 align:start position:0%
approve the uh courses or did I
 
03:48:31.070 --> 03:48:31.080 align:start position:0%
misunderstand that and if the if that's
 
03:48:35.469 --> 03:48:35.479 align:start position:0%
true then uh what is adding language
 
03:48:37.030 --> 03:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
saying that they may approve it actually
 
03:48:38.309 --> 03:48:38.319 align:start position:0%
going to
 
03:48:43.110 --> 03:48:43.120 align:start position:0%
do so um this issue occurred I don't
 
03:48:45.550 --> 03:48:45.560 align:start position:0%
know we're about a year out now um where
 
03:48:48.830 --> 03:48:48.840 align:start position:0%
there was uh oplc felt the existing
 
03:48:50.269 --> 03:48:50.279 align:start position:0%
statutory language there was some
 
03:48:51.870 --> 03:48:51.880 align:start position:0%
questions whether or not they could
 
03:48:53.630 --> 03:48:53.640 align:start position:0%
approve courses or that was a
 
03:48:55.670 --> 03:48:55.680 align:start position:0%
responsibility solely in the hands of
 
03:48:58.030 --> 03:48:58.040 align:start position:0%
the real estate commission um the real
 
03:49:00.030 --> 03:49:00.040 align:start position:0%
estate Commissioners have indicated that
 
03:49:02.590 --> 03:49:02.600 align:start position:0%
that's was Way Beyond their ability to
 
03:49:03.990 --> 03:49:04.000 align:start position:0%
review these some of these course
 
03:49:07.030 --> 03:49:07.040 align:start position:0%
applications are 100 pages long um and
 
03:49:08.309 --> 03:49:08.319 align:start position:0%
they felt that they did not have the
 
03:49:10.510 --> 03:49:10.520 align:start position:0%
requisite skills in order to do that I
 
03:49:12.429 --> 03:49:12.439 align:start position:0%
think that this issue largely has been
 
03:49:15.510 --> 03:49:15.520 align:start position:0%
resolved um and the oplc now has taken
 
03:49:17.870 --> 03:49:17.880 align:start position:0%
on some responsibility in working with
 
03:49:19.510 --> 03:49:19.520 align:start position:0%
the Real Estate Commission in order to
 
03:49:22.030 --> 03:49:22.040 align:start position:0%
approve those courses um since this bill
 
03:49:24.429 --> 03:49:24.439 align:start position:0%
was first this this bill was introduced
 
03:49:27.630 --> 03:49:27.640 align:start position:0%
so um you're correct I think that when
 
03:49:29.309 --> 03:49:29.319 align:start position:0%
it says may at least it gives them the
 
03:49:31.790 --> 03:49:31.800 align:start position:0%
opportunity to assist um but I think
 
03:49:34.389 --> 03:49:34.399 align:start position:0%
right now things are kind of working
 
03:49:36.429 --> 03:49:36.439 align:start position:0%
reasonably well in terms of the approval
 
03:49:41.110 --> 03:49:41.120 align:start position:0%
of courses followup follow up so is
 
03:49:43.389 --> 03:49:43.399 align:start position:0%
there language and I know I'm just
 
03:49:44.429 --> 03:49:44.439 align:start position:0%
looking at part of it here but is there
 
03:49:46.670 --> 03:49:46.680 align:start position:0%
Lang language that gives the authority
 
03:49:49.189 --> 03:49:49.199 align:start position:0%
to oplc does the oplc have authority to
 
03:49:51.950 --> 03:49:51.960 align:start position:0%
do it I'm going to defer to director
 
03:49:53.910 --> 03:49:53.920 align:start position:0%
Courtney to answer how they're working
 
03:49:56.030 --> 03:49:56.040 align:start position:0%
that currently and
 
03:49:59.070 --> 03:49:59.080 align:start position:0%
then well it's actually a a question on
 
03:50:00.870 --> 03:50:00.880 align:start position:0%
another part and that's I you may have
 
03:50:02.189 --> 03:50:02.199 align:start position:0%
said it and I think I may have missed it
 
03:50:03.990 --> 03:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
but on the post licensing where is that
 
03:50:06.030 --> 03:50:06.040 align:start position:0%
referred to doesn't appear to be in
 
03:50:09.990 --> 03:50:10.000 align:start position:0%
statute is that in rules or so no um
 
03:50:13.630 --> 03:50:13.640 align:start position:0%
there is it's um in RSA
 
03:50:18.149 --> 03:50:18.159 align:start position:0%
3318 to I believe currently uh no it
 
03:50:20.389 --> 03:50:20.399 align:start position:0%
does it appears in both rules and
 
03:50:22.750 --> 03:50:22.760 align:start position:0%
statute so this was a bill uh that was
 
03:50:25.750 --> 03:50:25.760 align:start position:0%
introduced by Senator Carson uh in 2018
 
03:50:27.269 --> 03:50:27.279 align:start position:0%
that passed that set up the post
 
03:50:29.670 --> 03:50:29.680 align:start position:0%
licensing requirement uh and I think
 
03:50:31.269 --> 03:50:31.279 align:start position:0%
that the office of Professional
 
03:50:33.510 --> 03:50:33.520 align:start position:0%
Licensing felt that the definition of
 
03:50:36.070 --> 03:50:36.080 align:start position:0%
post-licensing was not sufficient in
 
03:50:38.590 --> 03:50:38.600 align:start position:0%
order to continue to enforce so the
 
03:50:40.550 --> 03:50:40.560 align:start position:0%
intent here is to provide that
 
03:50:43.070 --> 03:50:43.080 align:start position:0%
definition so that that post-licensing
 
03:50:45.950 --> 03:50:45.960 align:start position:0%
requirement can happen um I will mention
 
03:50:49.189 --> 03:50:49.199 align:start position:0%
that we would suggest another amendment
 
03:50:51.189 --> 03:50:51.199 align:start position:0%
uh to the bill and just change February
 
03:50:54.590 --> 03:50:54.600 align:start position:0%
1st 2020 to February 1st
 
03:50:57.429 --> 03:50:57.439 align:start position:0%
2024 um and the reason for that is if we
 
03:50:59.550 --> 03:50:59.560 align:start position:0%
put in 2020 then people who are
 
03:51:03.510 --> 03:51:03.520 align:start position:0%
currently um had initially uh been
 
03:51:06.149 --> 03:51:06.159 align:start position:0%
approved for a real estate license would
 
03:51:08.110 --> 03:51:08.120 align:start position:0%
now suddenly potentially with very
 
03:51:10.830 --> 03:51:10.840 align:start position:0%
little notice have to take different
 
03:51:12.830 --> 03:51:12.840 align:start position:0%
continuing education courses than what
 
03:51:14.110 --> 03:51:14.120 align:start position:0%
they may have been taken over the past
 
03:51:15.830 --> 03:51:15.840 align:start position:0%
two years so we'd like it move sort of
 
03:51:17.349 --> 03:51:17.359 align:start position:0%
moving forward so only someone who
 
03:51:20.790 --> 03:51:20.800 align:start position:0%
becomes a leny after February of 2024
 
03:51:23.950 --> 03:51:23.960 align:start position:0%
would be subject to this follow up
 
03:51:26.229 --> 03:51:26.239 align:start position:0%
followup so I I searched through all of
 
03:51:28.910 --> 03:51:28.920 align:start position:0%
331a I didn't see any reference to post
 
03:51:32.750 --> 03:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
or post licensing so if you send that
 
03:51:35.950 --> 03:51:35.960 align:start position:0%
and um well what's in statute and all
 
03:51:38.229 --> 03:51:38.239 align:start position:0%
and then um any reference to the rules
 
03:51:39.950 --> 03:51:39.960 align:start position:0%
you're talking about sure
 
03:51:45.309 --> 03:51:45.319 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you represent schm
 
03:51:49.550 --> 03:51:49.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um couple of
 
03:51:53.110 --> 03:51:53.120 align:start position:0%
questions uh the reference in the uh
 
03:51:53.120 --> 03:51:55.990 align:start position:0%
questions uh the reference in the uh
analysis

03:51:55.990 --> 03:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:56.000 --> 03:51:58.830 align:start position:0%
 
indicates

03:51:58.830 --> 03:51:58.840 align:start position:0%
indicates
 
03:52:01.309 --> 03:52:01.319 align:start position:0%
a um
 
03:52:06.389 --> 03:52:06.399 align:start position:0%
qualification uh of the for such um a
 
03:52:10.149 --> 03:52:10.159 align:start position:0%
step forward to have a any agency board
 
03:52:14.710 --> 03:52:14.720 align:start position:0%
commission which exceeds 7,000 lenses
 
03:52:16.870 --> 03:52:16.880 align:start position:0%
how many licenses do you
 
03:52:19.469 --> 03:52:19.479 align:start position:0%
have I I think that there are I think
 
03:52:21.469 --> 03:52:21.479 align:start position:0%
there are about and I will again defer
 
03:52:23.149 --> 03:52:23.159 align:start position:0%
to direct corn I think there are about
 
03:52:25.389 --> 03:52:25.399 align:start position:0%
10,000 real estate licenses in the state
 
03:52:28.670 --> 03:52:28.680 align:start position:0%
currently okay that was my belief but uh
 
03:52:31.790 --> 03:52:31.800 align:start position:0%
I only saw 7,000 here so I thought but
 
03:52:33.830 --> 03:52:33.840 align:start position:0%
it exceeds I think the the language says
 
03:52:35.950 --> 03:52:35.960 align:start position:0%
that if a border commission has more
 
03:52:39.389 --> 03:52:39.399 align:start position:0%
then exceeds I understand but but I I I
 
03:52:40.830 --> 03:52:40.840 align:start position:0%
was figuring there were probably were
 
03:52:44.510 --> 03:52:44.520 align:start position:0%
more like 10,000 so I was wondering they
 
03:52:45.910 --> 03:52:45.920 align:start position:0%
must be somebody else they trying to
 
03:52:48.510 --> 03:52:48.520 align:start position:0%
pick off with the number
 
03:52:53.269 --> 03:52:53.279 align:start position:0%
7,000 uh so second question uh I'm sorry
 
03:52:56.429 --> 03:52:56.439 align:start position:0%
I your colleague who's the president uh
 
03:52:59.550 --> 03:52:59.560 align:start position:0%
was introduced uh as if everybody on
 
03:53:03.149 --> 03:53:03.159 align:start position:0%
this committee had functioning hearing
 
03:53:05.910 --> 03:53:05.920 align:start position:0%
that would disqualify me immediately uh
 
03:53:08.550 --> 03:53:08.560 align:start position:0%
so could you please say your name again
 
03:53:12.070 --> 03:53:12.080 align:start position:0%
Joanie McIntyre McIntyre Ah that's a
 
03:53:15.630 --> 03:53:15.640 align:start position:0%
name I can even spell thank you and j o
 
03:53:21.309 --> 03:53:21.319 align:start position:0%
n i j o a n i e oh j o n i e and
 
03:53:24.510 --> 03:53:24.520 align:start position:0%

e unless you spell it different than all
 
03:53:29.950 --> 03:53:29.960 align:start position:0%
the other mcintyres I know how to spell
 
03:53:33.149 --> 03:53:33.159 align:start position:0%
it okay thank you very
 
03:53:35.189 --> 03:53:35.199 align:start position:0%
much representative
 
03:53:37.710 --> 03:53:37.720 align:start position:0%
Brown uh thank you Mr chair and thanks
 
03:53:39.389 --> 03:53:39.399 align:start position:0%
for being here taking my
 
03:53:45.630 --> 03:53:45.640 align:start position:0%
question so the what is the um value for
 
03:53:45.640 --> 03:53:47.590 align:start position:0%
question so the what is the um value for
a

03:53:47.590 --> 03:53:47.600 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:53:50.990 --> 03:53:51.000 align:start position:0%
person to extend their license as
 
03:53:53.030 --> 03:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
opposed to uh to to put it on an active
 
03:53:55.990 --> 03:53:56.000 align:start position:0%
status it sounds like they still have to
 
03:53:58.269 --> 03:53:58.279 align:start position:0%
take uh they have to renew the license
 
03:54:00.229 --> 03:54:00.239 align:start position:0%
and still do the
 
03:54:03.750 --> 03:54:03.760 align:start position:0%
cus is it just that this will save them
 
03:54:05.950 --> 03:54:05.960 align:start position:0%
money for assurity bond or maintaining a
 
03:54:07.590 --> 03:54:07.600 align:start position:0%
place of business is that the is that
 
03:54:09.950 --> 03:54:09.960 align:start position:0%
the basic plus to this for those people
 
03:54:11.910 --> 03:54:11.920 align:start position:0%
so those people only have to take one of
 
03:54:13.269 --> 03:54:13.279 align:start position:0%
the courses they only have to take the
 
03:54:15.349 --> 03:54:15.359 align:start position:0%
core course
 
03:54:16.870 --> 03:54:16.880 align:start position:0%
and and then when they want to
 
03:54:18.990 --> 03:54:19.000 align:start position:0%
reactivate they have to have all the
 
03:54:20.670 --> 03:54:20.680 align:start position:0%
other courses but if they were to go
 
03:54:22.750 --> 03:54:22.760 align:start position:0%
inactive for four years they would just
 
03:54:24.830 --> 03:54:24.840 align:start position:0%
have to take the one core course each
 
03:54:34.469 --> 03:54:34.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:37.229 --> 03:54:37.239 align:start position:0%
welcome sorry any other questions yep
 
03:54:37.239 --> 03:54:39.349 align:start position:0%
welcome sorry any other questions yep
representative

03:54:39.349 --> 03:54:39.359 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:54:42.630 --> 03:54:42.640 align:start position:0%
G so I'm I'm
 
03:54:45.550 --> 03:54:45.560 align:start position:0%
uh someone who likes to have statues
 
03:54:45.560 --> 03:54:46.910 align:start position:0%
uh someone who likes to have statues
that

03:54:46.910 --> 03:54:46.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:54:46.920 --> 03:54:48.750 align:start position:0%
that
are

03:54:48.750 --> 03:54:48.760 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:54:53.469 --> 03:54:53.479 align:start position:0%
solid and when you have May in a statue
 
03:54:55.790 --> 03:54:55.800 align:start position:0%
what it that means like nothing to me
 
03:54:57.710 --> 03:54:57.720 align:start position:0%
right the commission may approve you're
 
03:55:00.510 --> 03:55:00.520 align:start position:0%
either going to or you're not and I
 
03:55:02.710 --> 03:55:02.720 align:start position:0%
don't know I mean someone's going to own
 
03:55:04.910 --> 03:55:04.920 align:start position:0%
that or someone's not going to own it to
 
03:55:08.630 --> 03:55:08.640 align:start position:0%
me just this is a statement that has no
 
03:55:12.630 --> 03:55:12.640 align:start position:0%
value in statute because it's too
 
03:55:16.389 --> 03:55:16.399 align:start position:0%
vague do you have comments on
 
03:55:19.710 --> 03:55:19.720 align:start position:0%
that so again I will defer to director
 
03:55:21.950 --> 03:55:21.960 align:start position:0%
Courtney in terms of um the statutory
 
03:55:24.429 --> 03:55:24.439 align:start position:0%
Authority that they're using right now
 
03:55:27.309 --> 03:55:27.319 align:start position:0%
um I guess the only intent here was
 
03:55:30.389 --> 03:55:30.399 align:start position:0%
prior to the oplc said they had no
 
03:55:34.750 --> 03:55:34.760 align:start position:0%
Authority uh to assist or um to approve
 
03:55:37.030 --> 03:55:37.040 align:start position:0%
continuing education so the intent was
 
03:55:40.110 --> 03:55:40.120 align:start position:0%
to at least give them the opportunity uh
 
03:55:42.710 --> 03:55:42.720 align:start position:0%
to do so if both the real estate
 
03:55:44.750 --> 03:55:44.760 align:start position:0%
commission and the oplc felt it was
 
03:55:46.830 --> 03:55:46.840 align:start position:0%
worthy that was the intent at least
 
03:55:49.790 --> 03:55:49.800 align:start position:0%
whether not meets that intent I don't
 
03:55:51.590 --> 03:55:51.600 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative
 
03:55:54.910 --> 03:55:54.920 align:start position:0%
Schmidt thank you Mr chairman so earlier
 
03:55:57.990 --> 03:55:58.000 align:start position:0%
on Bob you were talking about uh the the
 
03:56:01.269 --> 03:56:01.279 align:start position:0%
uh the examination and if
 
03:56:07.070 --> 03:56:07.080 align:start position:0%
the the U date of uh the statute
 
03:56:09.750 --> 03:56:09.760 align:start position:0%
proposed statute come going into effect
 
03:56:12.990 --> 03:56:13.000 align:start position:0%
could mess up uh somebody who got uh
 
03:56:14.309 --> 03:56:14.319 align:start position:0%
their license at that particular
 
03:56:17.670 --> 03:56:17.680 align:start position:0%
particular moment uh we find is those of
 
03:56:19.469 --> 03:56:19.479 align:start position:0%
us who've been on this committee for a
 
03:56:21.389 --> 03:56:21.399 align:start position:0%
while that there's a lot of stuff in the
 
03:56:26.349 --> 03:56:26.359 align:start position:0%
statute that um in my opinion is a
 
03:56:29.110 --> 03:56:29.120 align:start position:0%
potential landmine because addresses and
 
03:56:31.990 --> 03:56:32.000 align:start position:0%
so forth uh that are in
 
03:56:34.510 --> 03:56:34.520 align:start position:0%
statute if that address is no longer
 
03:56:36.870 --> 03:56:36.880 align:start position:0%
accurate now the statute has to be
 
03:56:40.269 --> 03:56:40.279 align:start position:0%
changed in order to uh to have it be
 
03:56:43.550 --> 03:56:43.560 align:start position:0%
correct um wouldn't it be better to have
 
03:56:47.830 --> 03:56:47.840 align:start position:0%
these detail of the of the license exam
 
03:56:50.990 --> 03:56:51.000 align:start position:0%
qualify qualifying exam wouldn't that be
 
03:56:53.710 --> 03:56:53.720 align:start position:0%
better to be something that the the
 
03:56:56.790 --> 03:56:56.800 align:start position:0%
board would have the authority to change
 
03:57:01.469 --> 03:57:01.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:03.950 --> 03:57:03.960 align:start position:0%
rules yeah I mean I I think a lot of
 
03:57:07.429 --> 03:57:07.439 align:start position:0%
that is already in existing statutory uh
 
03:57:09.710 --> 03:57:09.720 align:start position:0%
rules as well as the uh real estate
 
03:57:14.189 --> 03:57:14.199 align:start position:0%
which is rea the Reas um in in the RS so
 
03:57:15.830 --> 03:57:15.840 align:start position:0%
so I think a lot of that stuff's already
 
03:57:16.790 --> 03:57:16.800 align:start position:0%
there but I'm happy to have a
 
03:57:18.750 --> 03:57:18.760 align:start position:0%
conversation with you about um other
 
03:57:20.469 --> 03:57:20.479 align:start position:0%
issues that you feel might be better off
 
03:57:23.590 --> 03:57:23.600 align:start position:0%
putting in though okay thank
 
03:57:25.710 --> 03:57:25.720 align:start position:0%
you any further
 
03:57:27.990 --> 03:57:28.000 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
03:57:29.469 --> 03:57:29.479 align:start position:0%
much for your
 
03:57:31.750 --> 03:57:31.760 align:start position:0%
testimony director Courtney you were
 
03:57:32.790 --> 03:57:32.800 align:start position:0%
nodding your head a lot would you like
 
03:58:11.429 --> 03:58:11.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:12.710 --> 03:58:12.720 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Lindsay Courtney

03:58:22.110 --> 03:58:22.120 align:start position:0%
um I guess I would start by saying that
 
03:58:24.110 --> 03:58:24.120 align:start position:0%
I think that the Genesis of this bill
 
03:58:27.030 --> 03:58:27.040 align:start position:0%
this conversation started um probably
 
03:58:29.070 --> 03:58:29.080 align:start position:0%
over a year and a half ago and I just
 
03:58:30.510 --> 03:58:30.520 align:start position:0%
want to commend the
 
03:58:33.149 --> 03:58:33.159 align:start position:0%
association um we've enjoyed a very
 
03:58:35.750 --> 03:58:35.760 align:start position:0%
collaborative working relationship um
 
03:58:39.030 --> 03:58:39.040 align:start position:0%
and I think that uh we could certainly
 
03:58:42.070 --> 03:58:42.080 align:start position:0%
um continue to work on some language uh
 
03:58:44.670 --> 03:58:44.680 align:start position:0%
that um that we can come to an agreement
 
03:58:47.429 --> 03:58:47.439 align:start position:0%
on there are there have been some some
 
03:58:49.710 --> 03:58:49.720 align:start position:0%
changes since this bill was
 
03:58:53.110 --> 03:58:53.120 align:start position:0%
introduced um that I think uh would
 
03:58:56.030 --> 03:58:56.040 align:start position:0%
require um perhaps some modification to
 
03:58:58.309 --> 03:58:58.319 align:start position:0%
the to the current language I'll start
 
03:59:00.510 --> 03:59:00.520 align:start position:0%
with section four and I just want to
 
03:59:02.790 --> 03:59:02.800 align:start position:0%
give the committee a little bit of a
 
03:59:04.550 --> 03:59:04.560 align:start position:0%
overview of what was happening at the
 
03:59:07.030 --> 03:59:07.040 align:start position:0%
time this issue came about that prompted
 
03:59:07.040 --> 03:59:07.750 align:start position:0%
time this issue came about that prompted
the

03:59:07.750 --> 03:59:07.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:59:13.510 --> 03:59:13.520 align:start position:0%
bill so about a year and a half ago um
 
03:59:18.070 --> 03:59:18.080 align:start position:0%
prior to to House Bill 655 House Bill 2
 
03:59:20.830 --> 03:59:20.840 align:start position:0%
uh House Bill 409 passing that gave the
 
03:59:23.790 --> 03:59:23.800 align:start position:0%
office the authority to issue
 
03:59:26.830 --> 03:59:26.840 align:start position:0%
licenses um we our boards were the
 
03:59:28.910 --> 03:59:28.920 align:start position:0%
subject of several performance audits
 
03:59:32.349 --> 03:59:32.359 align:start position:0%
Dental Board um mental health uh there
 
03:59:34.950 --> 03:59:34.960 align:start position:0%
were a couple prior to that which made
 
03:59:38.630 --> 03:59:38.640 align:start position:0%
clear that unless there was statutory
 
03:59:42.670 --> 03:59:42.680 align:start position:0%
Authority um to have the office approve
 
03:59:44.790 --> 03:59:44.800 align:start position:0%
licenses that all of the license
 
03:59:47.070 --> 03:59:47.080 align:start position:0%
applications are supposed to be approved
 
03:59:49.149 --> 03:59:49.159 align:start position:0%
by the respective
 
03:59:52.189 --> 03:59:52.199 align:start position:0%
boards and then subsequently around that
 
03:59:54.229 --> 03:59:54.239 align:start position:0%
same time we had staff members for the
 
03:59:56.469 --> 03:59:56.479 align:start position:0%
Real Estate Commission leave which gave
 
03:59:58.510 --> 03:59:58.520 align:start position:0%
us an opportunity to kind of look into
 
04:00:00.189 --> 04:00:00.199 align:start position:0%
what's been going on for many years and
 
04:00:02.349 --> 04:00:02.359 align:start position:0%
what had been going on for many years is
 
04:00:06.070 --> 04:00:06.080 align:start position:0%
that staff had been evaluating approving
 
04:00:08.790 --> 04:00:08.800 align:start position:0%
um programs uh
 
04:00:11.309 --> 04:00:11.319 align:start position:0%
instructors and that approval did not
 
04:00:13.710 --> 04:00:13.720 align:start position:0%
line up with the statutes or the rules
 
04:00:17.870 --> 04:00:17.880 align:start position:0%
so so uh um one of our goals of our
 
04:00:20.110 --> 04:00:20.120 align:start position:0%
strategic plan is to ensure that we are
 
04:00:22.830 --> 04:00:22.840 align:start position:0%
complying with our statutes and rules so
 
04:00:25.110 --> 04:00:25.120 align:start position:0%
I personally took a look at the issue
 
04:00:28.910 --> 04:00:28.920 align:start position:0%
and quickly determined that um there was
 
04:00:31.389 --> 04:00:31.399 align:start position:0%
a statutory requirement for the
 
04:00:34.269 --> 04:00:34.279 align:start position:0%
commission at the time to accredit real
 
04:00:37.469 --> 04:00:37.479 align:start position:0%
estate courses now because approval is
 
04:00:40.469 --> 04:00:40.479 align:start position:0%
required that is tantamount to a license
 
04:00:42.790 --> 04:00:42.800 align:start position:0%
under New Hampshire law there's also a
 
04:00:44.389 --> 04:00:44.399 align:start position:0%
statutory requirement for the commission
 
04:00:47.790 --> 04:00:47.800 align:start position:0%
to accredit instructors again it's tant
 
04:00:49.670 --> 04:00:49.680 align:start position:0%
amount to a license under New Hampshire
 
04:00:52.189 --> 04:00:52.199 align:start position:0%
law so essentially the commission is
 
04:00:55.189 --> 04:00:55.199 align:start position:0%
required to license both courses and
 
04:00:58.670 --> 04:00:58.680 align:start position:0%
instructors uh the rules are continue to
 
04:01:01.110 --> 04:01:01.120 align:start position:0%
be a total mess in terms of the
 
04:01:02.950 --> 04:01:02.960 align:start position:0%
requirements between instructors and
 
04:01:04.429 --> 04:01:04.439 align:start position:0%
courses are
 
04:01:07.070 --> 04:01:07.080 align:start position:0%
conflated um and the application and
 
04:01:08.950 --> 04:01:08.960 align:start position:0%
approval process that had been done by
 
04:01:12.429 --> 04:01:12.439 align:start position:0%
staff were also conflated so our records
 
04:01:15.269 --> 04:01:15.279 align:start position:0%
uh did not accurately ref reflex whether
 
04:01:16.830 --> 04:01:16.840 align:start position:0%
an instructor had been issued an
 
04:01:18.950 --> 04:01:18.960 align:start position:0%
instructor license and a course had been
 
04:01:22.710 --> 04:01:22.720 align:start position:0%
approved um it wasn't uh it wasn't in
 
04:01:25.590 --> 04:01:25.600 align:start position:0%
compliance with the law at the same time
 
04:01:27.349 --> 04:01:27.359 align:start position:0%
we didn't have statutory authority to
 
04:01:29.550 --> 04:01:29.560 align:start position:0%
approve these courses or deny them so we
 
04:01:31.550 --> 04:01:31.560 align:start position:0%
said to the commission this is your
 
04:01:33.389 --> 04:01:33.399 align:start position:0%
statutory responsibility you have to do
 
04:01:36.349 --> 04:01:36.359 align:start position:0%
that um as previously noted they were
 
04:01:38.189 --> 04:01:38.199 align:start position:0%
concerned about the
 
04:01:41.910 --> 04:01:41.920 align:start position:0%
bandwidth subsequently this legislature
 
04:01:44.990 --> 04:01:45.000 align:start position:0%
passed House Bill 2 655 409 that gave us
 
04:01:48.189 --> 04:01:48.199 align:start position:0%
that Authority so we are now um
 
04:01:50.229 --> 04:01:50.239 align:start position:0%
approving the courses we are also
 
04:01:50.239 --> 04:01:51.349 align:start position:0%
approving the courses we are also
approving

04:01:51.349 --> 04:01:51.359 align:start position:0%
approving
 
04:01:55.710 --> 04:01:55.720 align:start position:0%
instructors based on the PLC rules um as
 
04:01:57.830 --> 04:01:57.840 align:start position:0%
well as any additional requirements set
 
04:02:00.990 --> 04:02:01.000 align:start position:0%
forth by the commission So currently we
 
04:02:04.309 --> 04:02:04.319 align:start position:0%
are issuing both instructor licenses and
 
04:02:06.950 --> 04:02:06.960 align:start position:0%
we are approving courses now from a
 
04:02:08.910 --> 04:02:08.920 align:start position:0%
policy consideration I'm not taking a
 
04:02:10.630 --> 04:02:10.640 align:start position:0%
position on whether you need a license
 
04:02:12.710 --> 04:02:12.720 align:start position:0%
instructors I do want to raise that
 
04:02:14.630 --> 04:02:14.640 align:start position:0%
question because I don't what value
 
04:02:16.389 --> 04:02:16.399 align:start position:0%
added there is in licensing the
 
04:02:19.149 --> 04:02:19.159 align:start position:0%
instructors if you're also approving the
 
04:02:21.229 --> 04:02:21.239 align:start position:0%
course so that's something that I think
 
04:02:23.950 --> 04:02:23.960 align:start position:0%
we need to consider and I think the past
 
04:02:25.870 --> 04:02:25.880 align:start position:0%
history represents that the commission
 
04:02:27.590 --> 04:02:27.600 align:start position:0%
and commission staff had conflated the
 
04:02:30.269 --> 04:02:30.279 align:start position:0%
two and had really become one process if
 
04:02:32.429 --> 04:02:32.439 align:start position:0%
it is intended to be one process we
 
04:02:33.830 --> 04:02:33.840 align:start position:0%
probably just need to repeal the
 
04:02:35.910 --> 04:02:35.920 align:start position:0%
requirement that we license instructors
 
04:02:37.750 --> 04:02:37.760 align:start position:0%
separately but again I don't take a
 
04:02:39.630 --> 04:02:39.640 align:start position:0%
position on that from a policy
 
04:02:41.590 --> 04:02:41.600 align:start position:0%
standpoint I don't think the current
 
04:02:44.110 --> 04:02:44.120 align:start position:0%
language in section 4 would actually
 
04:02:46.870 --> 04:02:46.880 align:start position:0%
make it any clearer um it would actually
 
04:02:49.870 --> 04:02:49.880 align:start position:0%
arguably confuse it further because it
 
04:02:52.750 --> 04:02:52.760 align:start position:0%
says the commission may approve
 
04:02:54.429 --> 04:02:54.439 align:start position:0%
Preparatory courses and Contin education
 
04:02:56.389 --> 04:02:56.399 align:start position:0%
courses and I think I I don't want to
 
04:02:58.189 --> 04:02:58.199 align:start position:0%
speak for the association but I do know
 
04:03:00.110 --> 04:03:00.120 align:start position:0%
that the commission and the office agree
 
04:03:01.429 --> 04:03:01.439 align:start position:0%
that the office should be approving
 
04:03:03.070 --> 04:03:03.080 align:start position:0%
these courses they don't have the
 
04:03:07.149 --> 04:03:07.159 align:start position:0%
bandwidth and um and really the
 
04:03:08.510 --> 04:03:08.520 align:start position:0%
requirement should be objective and we
 
04:03:10.429 --> 04:03:10.439 align:start position:0%
should be able to do that so I think by
 
04:03:13.469 --> 04:03:13.479 align:start position:0%
just removing um that section it should
 
04:03:16.229 --> 04:03:16.239 align:start position:0%
it should be fine the other issue is the
 
04:03:19.429 --> 04:03:19.439 align:start position:0%
single application issue if they are two
 
04:03:21.110 --> 04:03:21.120 align:start position:0%
separate licenses which under New
 
04:03:23.990 --> 04:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law they currently are um we
 
04:03:27.309 --> 04:03:27.319 align:start position:0%
would need we would need um we would
 
04:03:29.189 --> 04:03:29.199 align:start position:0%
need to capture that information
 
04:03:31.469 --> 04:03:31.479 align:start position:0%
separately um and the reason for that is
 
04:03:32.309 --> 04:03:32.319 align:start position:0%
you're going to have different
 
04:03:34.229 --> 04:03:34.239 align:start position:0%
instructors on different approved on
 
04:03:37.269 --> 04:03:37.279 align:start position:0%
different courses and the way we uh
 
04:03:38.910 --> 04:03:38.920 align:start position:0%
Implement that from a technological
 
04:03:40.149 --> 04:03:40.159 align:start position:0%
standpoint we wouldn't be able to
 
04:03:43.910 --> 04:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
separate that now again though I think
 
04:03:45.710 --> 04:03:45.720 align:start position:0%
that the inclusion of that language in
 
04:03:48.110 --> 04:03:48.120 align:start position:0%
this bill just represents that there's
 
04:03:50.309 --> 04:03:50.319 align:start position:0%
been a historic practice of Just
 
04:03:53.110 --> 04:03:53.120 align:start position:0%
conflating The Two and maybe we need to
 
04:03:56.070 --> 04:03:56.080 align:start position:0%
uh work on whether or not we should be
 
04:03:59.630 --> 04:03:59.640 align:start position:0%
doing it that way statutorily um so all
 
04:04:01.590 --> 04:04:01.600 align:start position:0%
that's to say is that's the history of
 
04:04:04.590 --> 04:04:04.600 align:start position:0%
that I think it's moving um it's working
 
04:04:07.830 --> 04:04:07.840 align:start position:0%
now um in light of uh what ooks did last
 
04:04:10.670 --> 04:04:10.680 align:start position:0%
year um and we can certainly work with
 
04:04:12.229 --> 04:04:12.239 align:start position:0%
the association and the commission on
 
04:04:14.830 --> 04:04:14.840 align:start position:0%
some additional language as necessary
 
04:04:16.229 --> 04:04:16.239 align:start position:0%
the office doesn't take a position on
 
04:04:19.750 --> 04:04:19.760 align:start position:0%
inactive status um we some of our boards
 
04:04:22.110 --> 04:04:22.120 align:start position:0%
have inactive status some don't some
 
04:04:24.030 --> 04:04:24.040 align:start position:0%
have inactive status that are required
 
04:04:27.389 --> 04:04:27.399 align:start position:0%
to renew some don't um we are capable of
 
04:04:30.070 --> 04:04:30.080 align:start position:0%
implementing that in either
 
04:04:33.229 --> 04:04:33.239 align:start position:0%
fashion with respect to section two the
 
04:04:36.630 --> 04:04:36.640 align:start position:0%
post licensing course so this again goes
 
04:04:41.349 --> 04:04:41.359 align:start position:0%
back to our um adherence or attempts to
 
04:04:43.670 --> 04:04:43.680 align:start position:0%
adhere to the statutes and the rules so
 
04:04:45.309 --> 04:04:45.319 align:start position:0%
so the Real Estate Commission rules like
 
04:04:48.030 --> 04:04:48.040 align:start position:0%
many of our board rules are not the best
 
04:04:50.750 --> 04:04:50.760 align:start position:0%
and in the current rules they use
 
04:04:53.710 --> 04:04:53.720 align:start position:0%
postlicensing and electives
 
04:04:56.550 --> 04:04:56.560 align:start position:0%
interchangeably so it's not clear based
 
04:05:01.349 --> 04:05:01.359 align:start position:0%
on our review of the rules um that
 
04:05:04.309 --> 04:05:04.319 align:start position:0%
postlicensing actually refers to that
 
04:05:06.269 --> 04:05:06.279 align:start position:0%
first uh renewal
 
04:05:10.309 --> 04:05:10.319 align:start position:0%
cycle um I think that is the reason why
 
04:05:12.110 --> 04:05:12.120 align:start position:0%
this definition would provide that
 
04:05:14.269 --> 04:05:14.279 align:start position:0%
Clarity and we don't take a position on
 
04:05:16.110 --> 04:05:16.120 align:start position:0%
that we're we we're happy to implement
 
04:05:19.950 --> 04:05:19.960 align:start position:0%
it um but uh the reason we haven't been
 
04:05:22.670 --> 04:05:22.680 align:start position:0%
able to implement it is because the
 
04:05:24.750 --> 04:05:24.760 align:start position:0%
current requirement that essentially
 
04:05:27.030 --> 04:05:27.040 align:start position:0%
conflates postlicensing period with
 
04:05:29.550 --> 04:05:29.560 align:start position:0%
electives conflicts with the statute and
 
04:05:31.229 --> 04:05:31.239 align:start position:0%
we can't have a rule that conflicts with
 
04:05:33.910 --> 04:05:33.920 align:start position:0%
with with the statute so by adding that
 
04:05:35.510 --> 04:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
definition I think it would certainly
 
04:05:37.830 --> 04:05:37.840 align:start position:0%
provide the clarity needed and we can
 
04:05:40.870 --> 04:05:40.880 align:start position:0%
Implement um we can Implement what the
 
04:05:42.389 --> 04:05:42.399 align:start position:0%
commission would like to do which is to
 
04:05:45.590 --> 04:05:45.600 align:start position:0%
create uh four separate categories of
 
04:05:48.870 --> 04:05:48.880 align:start position:0%
requirements for that first renewal
 
04:05:52.630 --> 04:05:52.640 align:start position:0%
cycle so lastly the other the the
 
04:05:56.670 --> 04:05:56.680 align:start position:0%
remaining issue is about the um section
 
04:06:00.070 --> 04:06:00.080 align:start position:0%
one and I I know that the association Mr
 
04:06:03.950 --> 04:06:03.960 align:start position:0%
Quinn I referenced an amendment um
 
04:06:07.630 --> 04:06:07.640 align:start position:0%
we I'm sure we can find um an agreement
 
04:06:09.070 --> 04:06:09.080 align:start position:0%
and it's probably that language that I
 
04:06:12.030 --> 04:06:12.040 align:start position:0%
haven't re-reviewed but we did agree to
 
04:06:14.830 --> 04:06:14.840 align:start position:0%
other language that we we could work uh
 
04:06:16.189 --> 04:06:16.199 align:start position:0%
we could work together
 
04:06:19.189 --> 04:06:19.199 align:start position:0%
on um my concern primarily with section
 
04:06:22.830 --> 04:06:22.840 align:start position:0%
one is that the boards are currently
 
04:06:26.790 --> 04:06:26.800 align:start position:0%
already not meeting their costs so as
 
04:06:28.630 --> 04:06:28.640 align:start position:0%
you see on the handout that I provided
 
04:06:31.710 --> 04:06:31.720 align:start position:0%
to you um there are I've actually
 
04:06:33.309 --> 04:06:33.319 align:start position:0%
separated nursing with nursing
 
04:06:35.590 --> 04:06:35.600 align:start position:0%
assistants based on the conversations
 
04:06:38.229 --> 04:06:38.239 align:start position:0%
that we've had in the past and the
 
04:06:39.710 --> 04:06:39.720 align:start position:0%
potential goal of getting nursing
 
04:06:41.429 --> 04:06:41.439 align:start position:0%
assistance funded through a different
 
04:06:43.630 --> 04:06:43.640 align:start position:0%
mechanism but there are currently 7
 
04:06:47.269 --> 04:06:47.279 align:start position:0%
boards that are um that have over 7,000
 
04:06:51.790 --> 04:06:51.800 align:start position:0%
lenses we recently did a um an analysis
 
04:06:54.990 --> 04:06:55.000 align:start position:0%
of where we think they will be in FY 26
 
04:06:57.070 --> 04:06:57.080 align:start position:0%
based on the current funding that we
 
04:06:58.870 --> 04:06:58.880 align:start position:0%
receive from the boards as well as
 
04:07:00.149 --> 04:07:00.159 align:start position:0%
assuming that we don't have any
 
04:07:00.159 --> 04:07:01.670 align:start position:0%
assuming that we don't have any
additional

04:07:01.670 --> 04:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
additional
 
04:07:04.030 --> 04:07:04.040 align:start position:0%
Appropriations so the only boards that
 
04:07:05.510 --> 04:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
are currently meeting their costs are
 
04:07:07.510 --> 04:07:07.520 align:start position:0%
Engineers Medicine and
 
04:07:09.990 --> 04:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy um the office through the next
 
04:07:12.429 --> 04:07:12.439 align:start position:0%
budget session is going to have to uh
 
04:07:13.510 --> 04:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
work with the boards and we are
 
04:07:14.590 --> 04:07:14.600 align:start position:0%
currently working with the boards
 
04:07:19.349 --> 04:07:19.359 align:start position:0%
they've all received a letter um as to
 
04:07:21.110 --> 04:07:21.120 align:start position:0%
whether we're going to cut expenses or
 
04:07:23.790 --> 04:07:23.800 align:start position:0%
increase Revenue so if we are required
 
04:07:27.030 --> 04:07:27.040 align:start position:0%
to add additional staff obviously that
 
04:07:31.590 --> 04:07:31.600 align:start position:0%
just would um lead to a potential uh
 
04:07:33.990 --> 04:07:34.000 align:start position:0%
increase in the deficit um and we have
 
04:07:35.149 --> 04:07:35.159 align:start position:0%
other boards that are essentially
 
04:07:37.229 --> 04:07:37.239 align:start position:0%
subsidizing certain boards so that's our
 
04:07:37.239 --> 04:07:38.870 align:start position:0%
subsidizing certain boards so that's our
primary

04:07:38.870 --> 04:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
primary
 
04:07:41.790 --> 04:07:41.800 align:start position:0%
concern the other concern is that what
 
04:07:44.229 --> 04:07:44.239 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do
 
04:07:46.349 --> 04:07:46.359 align:start position:0%
and I fully recognize that particularly
 
04:07:48.670 --> 04:07:48.680 align:start position:0%
at the time that this bill um was
 
04:07:51.630 --> 04:07:51.640 align:start position:0%
introduced that the office was
 
04:07:54.229 --> 04:07:54.239 align:start position:0%
particularly challenged by the volume of
 
04:07:57.109 --> 04:07:57.119 align:start position:0%
calls um by a lack you know the probably
 
04:07:59.269 --> 04:07:59.279 align:start position:0%
an inefficient way of managing our call
 
04:08:01.990 --> 04:08:02.000 align:start position:0%
volume um um we certainly had some
 
04:08:04.710 --> 04:08:04.720 align:start position:0%
concerns with staff responding to com to
 
04:08:06.550 --> 04:08:06.560 align:start position:0%
constituent inquiries in a timely
 
04:08:09.990 --> 04:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
fashion I do think that not I think we
 
04:08:12.109 --> 04:08:12.119 align:start position:0%
have made a concered effort to improve
 
04:08:14.870 --> 04:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
that and I think the ICS show that on
 
04:08:17.590 --> 04:08:17.600 align:start position:0%
average um our weight time is fairly
 
04:08:20.030 --> 04:08:20.040 align:start position:0%
minimal we already have three dedicated
 
04:08:22.149 --> 04:08:22.159 align:start position:0%
staff licensing staff that support the
 
04:08:23.389 --> 04:08:23.399 align:start position:0%
real estate commission and the Real
 
04:08:25.389 --> 04:08:25.399 align:start position:0%
Estate Commission only and we have a
 
04:08:27.189 --> 04:08:27.199 align:start position:0%
shared board administrator who's
 
04:08:29.590 --> 04:08:29.600 align:start position:0%
responsible for being the liaison and
 
04:08:31.870 --> 04:08:31.880 align:start position:0%
then our first tier calls are answered
 
04:08:34.469 --> 04:08:34.479 align:start position:0%
by the customer service unit if they're
 
04:08:36.269 --> 04:08:36.279 align:start position:0%
not able to answer the question they're
 
04:08:40.030 --> 04:08:40.040 align:start position:0%
passed on to licensing as tier two so
 
04:08:42.670 --> 04:08:42.680 align:start position:0%
the concern with having one dedicated
 
04:08:44.630 --> 04:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
person to answer the phones and respond
 
04:08:46.349 --> 04:08:46.359 align:start position:0%
to inquiries that I'm always concerned
 
04:08:48.389 --> 04:08:48.399 align:start position:0%
about as a single point of failure when
 
04:08:50.429 --> 04:08:50.439 align:start position:0%
I first joined the office we had single
 
04:08:52.990 --> 04:08:53.000 align:start position:0%
points of failure everywhere um we
 
04:08:54.990 --> 04:08:55.000 align:start position:0%
didn't even know what phone numbers we
 
04:08:56.910 --> 04:08:56.920 align:start position:0%
had staff would leave and we had
 
04:08:58.790 --> 04:08:58.800 align:start position:0%
voicemails that apparently were full
 
04:09:02.349 --> 04:09:02.359 align:start position:0%
nobody knew that we had those voicemails
 
04:09:04.710 --> 04:09:04.720 align:start position:0%
there were old numbers that had been
 
04:09:07.389 --> 04:09:07.399 align:start position:0%
assigned to other people there were
 
04:09:10.030 --> 04:09:10.040 align:start position:0%
checks in the drawers there were emails
 
04:09:12.109 --> 04:09:12.119 align:start position:0%
that nobody could access there was
 
04:09:14.030 --> 04:09:14.040 align:start position:0%
information hoarding going going on all
 
04:09:15.950 --> 04:09:15.960 align:start position:0%
over the place this is why it's taken me
 
04:09:17.510 --> 04:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
5 years to even get to the point where
 
04:09:18.870 --> 04:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
we can look at the Real Estate
 
04:09:22.229 --> 04:09:22.239 align:start position:0%
Commission um course issues so I'm
 
04:09:25.109 --> 04:09:25.119 align:start position:0%
always a little hesitant to say that
 
04:09:27.429 --> 04:09:27.439 align:start position:0%
there should be one person
 
04:09:30.990 --> 04:09:31.000 align:start position:0%
responsible um for uh for this
 
04:09:34.349 --> 04:09:34.359 align:start position:0%
particular function um because Anything
 
04:09:36.710 --> 04:09:36.720 align:start position:0%
Could Happen they could go out uh and
 
04:09:38.030 --> 04:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
they could get hit by a bus they could
 
04:09:40.870 --> 04:09:40.880 align:start position:0%
win the lottery and we have no idea what
 
04:09:42.309 --> 04:09:42.319 align:start position:0%
you know what's been going on what's
 
04:09:44.349 --> 04:09:44.359 align:start position:0%
been communicated so I think we need to
 
04:09:45.950 --> 04:09:45.960 align:start position:0%
have systems in the office and the
 
04:09:47.429 --> 04:09:47.439 align:start position:0%
system that we currently have is that we
 
04:09:49.109 --> 04:09:49.119 align:start position:0%
have an intake procedure we don't have
 
04:09:51.590 --> 04:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
the ability to leave voicemails on our
 
04:09:51.600 --> 04:09:52.670 align:start position:0%
the ability to leave voicemails on our
main

04:09:52.670 --> 04:09:52.680 align:start position:0%
main
 
04:09:56.389 --> 04:09:56.399 align:start position:0%
line um we have a triage system we have
 
04:09:59.349 --> 04:09:59.359 align:start position:0%
a logging system calls get transferred
 
04:10:01.189 --> 04:10:01.199 align:start position:0%
that gets logged so we have the ability
 
04:10:05.389 --> 04:10:05.399 align:start position:0%
to pull metrics like this
 
04:10:08.149 --> 04:10:08.159 align:start position:0%
so I think that the association has
 
04:10:11.030 --> 04:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
raised a valid concern and I think that
 
04:10:16.189 --> 04:10:16.199 align:start position:0%
we are working hard to address their leg
 
04:10:17.670 --> 04:10:17.680 align:start position:0%
very legitimate
 
04:10:21.189 --> 04:10:21.199 align:start position:0%
concerns I don't know that I want to I
 
04:10:23.870 --> 04:10:23.880 align:start position:0%
think we should legislate a solution
 
04:10:26.750 --> 04:10:26.760 align:start position:0%
because I think that there may be other
 
04:10:29.030 --> 04:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
solutions that we should continue to
 
04:10:32.830 --> 04:10:32.840 align:start position:0%
look at outside of the statutory process
 
04:10:35.469 --> 04:10:35.479 align:start position:0%
that said um the amendment that Mr Quinn
 
04:10:36.990 --> 04:10:37.000 align:start position:0%
passed around that's something that we
 
04:10:39.630 --> 04:10:39.640 align:start position:0%
could certainly live with if you know we
 
04:10:42.070 --> 04:10:42.080 align:start position:0%
could make it work um it basically would
 
04:10:43.790 --> 04:10:43.800 align:start position:0%
require us to consult with the boards
 
04:10:45.830 --> 04:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
which we are already required to do with
 
04:10:48.670 --> 04:10:48.680 align:start position:0%
respect to funding and if you know they
 
04:10:52.870 --> 04:10:52.880 align:start position:0%
so desire a particular position um then
 
04:10:54.269 --> 04:10:54.279 align:start position:0%
then that's something we can certainly
 
04:10:56.910 --> 04:10:56.920 align:start position:0%
live with the other final piece that
 
04:11:00.070 --> 04:11:00.080 align:start position:0%
I'll just leave you with is that um
 
04:11:02.670 --> 04:11:02.680 align:start position:0%
people are not uh banging down the the
 
04:11:06.309 --> 04:11:06.319 align:start position:0%
doors at the state to get a job here um
 
04:11:07.630 --> 04:11:07.640 align:start position:0%
this is very different from when I first
 
04:11:09.790 --> 04:11:09.800 align:start position:0%
started in 2019 where we could hire
 
04:11:13.870 --> 04:11:13.880 align:start position:0%
people so even assuming we had such
 
04:11:15.550 --> 04:11:15.560 align:start position:0%
positions it's not a guarantee that we
 
04:11:16.910 --> 04:11:16.920 align:start position:0%
could fill them and it's not a guarantee
 
04:11:19.510 --> 04:11:19.520 align:start position:0%
that we could fill them at um with
 
04:11:21.790 --> 04:11:21.800 align:start position:0%
qualified applicants so I think
 
04:11:25.030 --> 04:11:25.040 align:start position:0%
regardless of what we do um this year
 
04:11:27.950 --> 04:11:27.960 align:start position:0%
the office is committed to having other
 
04:11:30.670 --> 04:11:30.680 align:start position:0%
Solutions um in place to ensure that we
 
04:11:33.309 --> 04:11:33.319 align:start position:0%
are improving customer service so thatd
 
04:11:35.670 --> 04:11:35.680 align:start position:0%
be Happ to answer any questions thank
 
04:11:38.030 --> 04:11:38.040 align:start position:0%
you representative Gera and
 
04:11:40.630 --> 04:11:40.640 align:start position:0%
theas thanks I'm glad you qualified that
 
04:11:42.309 --> 04:11:42.319 align:start position:0%
last statement because I'm I'm sort of
 
04:11:45.750 --> 04:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
in the same boat that you you are um I
 
04:11:47.590 --> 04:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
think that the whole purpose of the
 
04:11:49.750 --> 04:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
changes that we made in oplc was to try
 
04:11:51.670 --> 04:11:51.680 align:start position:0%
to manage the cost of the organization
 
04:11:53.590 --> 04:11:53.600 align:start position:0%
and I understand that when you first
 
04:11:55.469 --> 04:11:55.479 align:start position:0%
start something different it you know
 
04:11:58.510 --> 04:11:58.520 align:start position:0%
can be challenging so I I don't I agree
 
04:12:02.429 --> 04:12:02.439 align:start position:0%
with the 7,000 people putting somebody
 
04:12:05.189 --> 04:12:05.199 align:start position:0%
to to handle that that is not something
 
04:12:07.469 --> 04:12:07.479 align:start position:0%
that right now I'm I have the stomach to
 
04:12:11.750 --> 04:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
do right um number two
 
04:12:15.189 --> 04:12:15.199 align:start position:0%
um I would like more information on how
 
04:12:15.199 --> 04:12:15.950 align:start position:0%
um I would like more information on how
you

04:12:15.950 --> 04:12:15.960 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:12:18.670 --> 04:12:18.680 align:start position:0%
calculated the projected Revenue versus
 
04:12:20.790 --> 04:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
cost ratio for these
 
04:12:24.910 --> 04:12:24.920 align:start position:0%
because um that can be I mean I can see
 
04:12:26.429 --> 04:12:26.439 align:start position:0%
you could do this many many different
 
04:12:28.149 --> 04:12:28.159 align:start position:0%
ways so is that information you could
 
04:12:32.109 --> 04:12:32.119 align:start position:0%
share with us yes so I personally did
 
04:12:33.830 --> 04:12:33.840 align:start position:0%
the calculations it took me about a
 
04:12:36.550 --> 04:12:36.560 align:start position:0%
month and a half um it's like painting
 
04:12:37.670 --> 04:12:37.680 align:start position:0%
your house you think it's going to take
 
04:12:40.910 --> 04:12:40.920 align:start position:0%
a day and it doesn't um I have two
 
04:12:44.550 --> 04:12:44.560 align:start position:0%
spreadsheets uh one one cuz there's two
 
04:12:47.990 --> 04:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
proposed cost allocation models um this
 
04:12:49.950 --> 04:12:49.960 align:start position:0%
is based on the model that we currently
 
04:12:53.109 --> 04:12:53.119 align:start position:0%
use and that's an allocation based on
 
04:12:56.349 --> 04:12:56.359 align:start position:0%
license C and then I have so yes I can
 
04:12:58.189 --> 04:12:58.199 align:start position:0%
certainly sit down with you they're very
 
04:13:00.429 --> 04:13:00.439 align:start position:0%
lengthy spreadsheets um basically we
 
04:13:02.030 --> 04:13:02.040 align:start position:0%
were able to get down into the
 
04:13:04.750 --> 04:13:04.760 align:start position:0%
nitty-gritty and B basically able to
 
04:13:07.510 --> 04:13:07.520 align:start position:0%
allocate costs of personnel which is our
 
04:13:11.030 --> 04:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
highest expense by far based on uh
 
04:13:14.510 --> 04:13:14.520 align:start position:0%
projected usage um which is determined
 
04:13:17.790 --> 04:13:17.800 align:start position:0%
by basically an average past usage so
 
04:13:20.950 --> 04:13:20.960 align:start position:0%
essentially the boards that are using uh
 
04:13:22.870 --> 04:13:22.880 align:start position:0%
investigators are the boards that are
 
04:13:25.750 --> 04:13:25.760 align:start position:0%
paying for that peretta portion of
 
04:13:28.189 --> 04:13:28.199 align:start position:0%
investigator costs boards that don't use
 
04:13:29.990 --> 04:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
investigators are not contributing to
 
04:13:31.830 --> 04:13:31.840 align:start position:0%
that cost whereas previously we kind of
 
04:13:34.149 --> 04:13:34.159 align:start position:0%
lumped all of those costs together and
 
04:13:36.590 --> 04:13:36.600 align:start position:0%
so I think it's a more accurate picture
 
04:13:38.830 --> 04:13:38.840 align:start position:0%
of what the boards are using in terms of
 
04:13:41.149 --> 04:13:41.159 align:start position:0%
resources um than we've been able to do
 
04:13:46.070 --> 04:13:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:46.080 --> 04:13:47.389 align:start position:0%
 
thank

04:13:47.389 --> 04:13:47.399 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:13:50.269 --> 04:13:50.279 align:start position:0%
you um so this is a little more general
 
04:13:53.030 --> 04:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
question seeing this uh projected p
 
04:13:55.189 --> 04:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
ratio for these licenses that raises the
 
04:13:58.429 --> 04:13:58.439 align:start position:0%
question for me is um are are you at
 
04:14:00.590 --> 04:14:00.600 align:start position:0%
risk of of not meeting the requirement
 
04:14:03.670 --> 04:14:03.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:06.790 --> 04:14:06.800 align:start position:0%
self-funding so I would
 
04:14:13.189 --> 04:14:13.199 align:start position:0%
say not this fiscal year so the the
 
04:14:16.710 --> 04:14:16.720 align:start position:0%
the 12% increase particularly with wages
 
04:14:20.349 --> 04:14:20.359 align:start position:0%
last year um is a challenge for the
 
04:14:23.830 --> 04:14:23.840 align:start position:0%
office uh historically we've had a
 
04:14:26.149 --> 04:14:26.159 align:start position:0%
lapse um
 
04:14:29.429 --> 04:14:29.439 align:start position:0%
and this body changed that so we don't
 
04:14:32.630 --> 04:14:32.640 align:start position:0%
lapse money and so we did have some roll
 
04:14:35.670 --> 04:14:35.680 align:start position:0%
over last year and so we are meaning our
 
04:14:37.550 --> 04:14:37.560 align:start position:0%
cost this year but we're eating into
 
04:14:39.710 --> 04:14:39.720 align:start position:0%
that rollover so it's clear that we're
 
04:14:43.349 --> 04:14:43.359 align:start position:0%
not bringing in sufficient Revenue um on
 
04:14:47.750 --> 04:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
a yearly basis to continue to uh manage
 
04:14:51.189 --> 04:14:51.199 align:start position:0%
to to pay for all of these appropriated
 
04:14:53.670 --> 04:14:53.680 align:start position:0%
expenses and part of that has to do with
 
04:14:55.469 --> 04:14:55.479 align:start position:0%
the fact that many boards and this is
 
04:14:56.910 --> 04:14:56.920 align:start position:0%
contained in the letters that I sent to
 
04:14:58.630 --> 04:14:58.640 align:start position:0%
the boards over the last month is that
 
04:15:00.070 --> 04:15:00.080 align:start position:0%
many boards haven't raised their fees in
 
04:15:04.309 --> 04:15:04.319 align:start position:0%
20 years and so um that coupled with
 
04:15:06.990 --> 04:15:07.000 align:start position:0%
inflation coupled with increased costs
 
04:15:08.990 --> 04:15:09.000 align:start position:0%
just of doing business Personnel costs
 
04:15:10.910 --> 04:15:10.920 align:start position:0%
are by far largest
 
04:15:13.950 --> 04:15:13.960 align:start position:0%
expense um that's challenge so we're
 
04:15:17.189 --> 04:15:17.199 align:start position:0%
going to have to make some decisions and
 
04:15:19.309 --> 04:15:19.319 align:start position:0%
um the decisions are obviously decrease
 
04:15:21.269 --> 04:15:21.279 align:start position:0%
expenditures or Inc increase
 
04:15:23.349 --> 04:15:23.359 align:start position:0%
Appropriations and I think it may be a
 
04:15:27.149 --> 04:15:27.159 align:start position:0%
combination of both um cosmetology for
 
04:15:29.950 --> 04:15:29.960 align:start position:0%
example is at what 28% they've been
 
04:15:32.790 --> 04:15:32.800 align:start position:0%
around that for years because they have
 
04:15:37.189 --> 04:15:37.199 align:start position:0%
uh only charged their lenses $50 or $40
 
04:15:39.750 --> 04:15:39.760 align:start position:0%
for 2 years nobody pays that you know
 
04:15:42.269 --> 04:15:42.279 align:start position:0%
you've got the Physicians paying $350
 
04:15:44.469 --> 04:15:44.479 align:start position:0%
and they've been paying that for years
 
04:15:47.670 --> 04:15:47.680 align:start position:0%
and so when you and and barbering uses a
 
04:15:49.469 --> 04:15:49.479 align:start position:0%
significant amount of
 
04:15:52.990 --> 04:15:53.000 align:start position:0%
resources so I think that we're going to
 
04:15:55.070 --> 04:15:55.080 align:start position:0%
have to have some hard conversations
 
04:15:56.510 --> 04:15:56.520 align:start position:0%
with these boards over the next couple
 
04:15:59.189 --> 04:15:59.199 align:start position:0%
months as to you know what would you
 
04:16:00.710 --> 04:16:00.720 align:start position:0%
like to
 
04:16:03.870 --> 04:16:03.880 align:start position:0%
do okay and uh this is to the chair or
 
04:16:05.990 --> 04:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
or Madam not currently the chair is this
 
04:16:23.950 --> 04:16:23.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:28.670 --> 04:16:28.680 align:start position:0%
oh let's talk afterwards certainly thank
 
04:16:30.750 --> 04:16:30.760 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
04:16:34.030 --> 04:16:34.040 align:start position:0%
goalie thank you Mr chair and one quick
 
04:16:35.349 --> 04:16:35.359 align:start position:0%
question as you were talking earlier
 
04:16:37.830 --> 04:16:37.840 align:start position:0%
about hiring individuals and trying to
 
04:16:40.469 --> 04:16:40.479 align:start position:0%
get people in could you tell me uh where
 
04:16:42.309 --> 04:16:42.319 align:start position:0%
you are on vacancy rate for those
 
04:16:43.550 --> 04:16:43.560 align:start position:0%
answering theil emails and the phone
 
04:16:46.189 --> 04:16:46.199 align:start position:0%
calls or if they're fully filled so we
 
04:16:50.550 --> 04:16:50.560 align:start position:0%
just fully staffed that Customer Service
 
04:16:53.590 --> 04:16:53.600 align:start position:0%
Unit uh it's only five people um but for
 
04:16:56.389 --> 04:16:56.399 align:start position:0%
a while we had only filled two of the
 
04:16:58.590 --> 04:16:58.600 align:start position:0%
positions it's a position that's very
 
04:16:59.870 --> 04:16:59.880 align:start position:0%
difficult to fill because you're
 
04:17:02.830 --> 04:17:02.840 align:start position:0%
answering phones all day um so what we
 
04:17:05.229 --> 04:17:05.239 align:start position:0%
did is we required every person in the
 
04:17:09.910 --> 04:17:09.920 align:start position:0%
office including myself to take uh a
 
04:17:12.309 --> 04:17:12.319 align:start position:0%
certain segment of time on a weekly
 
04:17:14.389 --> 04:17:14.399 align:start position:0%
basis and answer phone calls that's how
 
04:17:17.070 --> 04:17:17.080 align:start position:0%
we were able to get down the phone calls
 
04:17:20.109 --> 04:17:20.119 align:start position:0%
um we were just able to remove the staff
 
04:17:23.229 --> 04:17:23.239 align:start position:0%
who aren't assigned to CSU from that
 
04:17:26.710 --> 04:17:26.720 align:start position:0%
call unit um just this week and I will
 
04:17:28.349 --> 04:17:28.359 align:start position:0%
be monitoring to make sure that the call
 
04:17:31.630 --> 04:17:31.640 align:start position:0%
volume is still low or the the weight
 
04:17:33.950 --> 04:17:33.960 align:start position:0%
times are still
 
04:17:38.229 --> 04:17:38.239 align:start position:0%
low anyone else yes representative
 
04:17:41.630 --> 04:17:41.640 align:start position:0%
go but do I remember the question now
 
04:17:43.990 --> 04:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
okay yes I do
 
04:17:48.590 --> 04:17:48.600 align:start position:0%
so my question is given the time crunch
 
04:17:50.030 --> 04:17:50.040 align:start position:0%
for all of
 
04:17:54.590 --> 04:17:54.600 align:start position:0%
this if you talked if I if I heard you
 
04:17:57.070 --> 04:17:57.080 align:start position:0%
correctly you talked about there was
 
04:17:57.080 --> 04:17:58.309 align:start position:0%
correctly you talked about there was
some

04:17:58.309 --> 04:17:58.319 align:start position:0%
some
 
04:18:02.149 --> 04:18:02.159 align:start position:0%
conflicting um statutes currently that
 
04:18:04.910 --> 04:18:04.920 align:start position:0%
complicate matters for this commission
 
04:18:06.790 --> 04:18:06.800 align:start position:0%
is that correct and the
 
04:18:09.950 --> 04:18:09.960 align:start position:0%
office so I think section four would
 
04:18:13.109 --> 04:18:13.119 align:start position:0%
would um confuse things further I think
 
04:18:15.510 --> 04:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
at the time that it was
 
04:18:18.070 --> 04:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
drafted it was not clear maybe we didn't
 
04:18:20.870 --> 04:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
have that Authority yet under 655 or 409
 
04:18:23.349 --> 04:18:23.359 align:start position:0%
but now we do so I don't think we need
 
04:18:25.550 --> 04:18:25.560 align:start position:0%
section four
 
04:18:29.429 --> 04:18:29.439 align:start position:0%
um so follow up follow up so my question
 
04:18:32.389 --> 04:18:32.399 align:start position:0%
was I I I heard that I was correct in
 
04:18:33.710 --> 04:18:33.720 align:start position:0%
understanding there's already some
 
04:18:37.389 --> 04:18:37.399 align:start position:0%
conflictual stuff my question is if we
 
04:18:41.070 --> 04:18:41.080 align:start position:0%
do not pass this does it make matters
 
04:18:43.229 --> 04:18:43.239 align:start position:0%
worse or better
 
04:18:45.790 --> 04:18:45.800 align:start position:0%
I think you would I think that and I I
 
04:18:47.189 --> 04:18:47.199 align:start position:0%
don't take a position but I think
 
04:18:47.199 --> 04:18:48.070 align:start position:0%
don't take a position but I think
there's

04:18:48.070 --> 04:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
there's
 
04:18:50.910 --> 04:18:50.920 align:start position:0%
a articulated need on the
 
04:18:55.710 --> 04:18:55.720 align:start position:0%
inactive piece um that makes sense to me
 
04:18:58.389 --> 04:18:58.399 align:start position:0%
and so I think I would would think you
 
04:19:00.349 --> 04:19:00.359 align:start position:0%
would need to move something forward in
 
04:19:04.030 --> 04:19:04.040 align:start position:0%
order to make that happen um and I think
 
04:19:07.550 --> 04:19:07.560 align:start position:0%
postlicensing the definition as well now
 
04:19:08.950 --> 04:19:08.960 align:start position:0%
I think the Real Estate Commission has
 
04:19:11.790 --> 04:19:11.800 align:start position:0%
the authority to do that in rule um and
 
04:19:13.550 --> 04:19:13.560 align:start position:0%
so we're we're B basically inserting a
 
04:19:17.269 --> 04:19:17.279 align:start position:0%
statutory definition to shore up their
 
04:19:19.910 --> 04:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
rules when in reality they could just
 
04:19:24.109 --> 04:19:24.119 align:start position:0%
redo the rules um but practically that's
 
04:19:26.429 --> 04:19:26.439 align:start position:0%
always a challenge with some of our with
 
04:19:28.149 --> 04:19:28.159 align:start position:0%
with regulatory
 
04:19:32.429 --> 04:19:32.439 align:start position:0%
boards okay thank you representative
 
04:19:34.910 --> 04:19:34.920 align:start position:0%
grto so a possible
 
04:19:39.710 --> 04:19:39.720 align:start position:0%
solution would be to take that inactive
 
04:19:43.229 --> 04:19:43.239 align:start position:0%
piece and add it to something else so we
 
04:19:45.030 --> 04:19:45.040 align:start position:0%
we that's not the where the fiscal note
 
04:19:48.229 --> 04:19:48.239 align:start position:0%
comes in right the fiscal note comes in
 
04:19:51.630 --> 04:19:51.640 align:start position:0%
because uh of the requirement as worded
 
04:19:53.950 --> 04:19:53.960 align:start position:0%
that we have dedicated staff right yes
 
04:19:56.429 --> 04:19:56.439 align:start position:0%
correct so if we okay so that's one way
 
04:19:58.309 --> 04:19:58.319 align:start position:0%
of handling of getting that across the
 
04:20:01.710 --> 04:20:01.720 align:start position:0%
Finish Line without taking the rest of
 
04:20:03.149 --> 04:20:03.159 align:start position:0%
the bill with
 
04:20:09.389 --> 04:20:09.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:14.109 --> 04:20:14.119 align:start position:0%
sorry any other any other questions
 
04:20:17.109 --> 04:20:17.119 align:start position:0%
thank you director appreciate your time
 
04:20:20.429 --> 04:20:20.439 align:start position:0%
did anybody else wish to testify on S SP
 
04:20:22.710 --> 04:20:22.720 align:start position:0%
480 seeing no one I will close a public
 
04:20:25.189 --> 04:20:25.199 align:start position:0%
hearing on S SP 480 I will open up the
 
04:20:27.309 --> 04:20:27.319 align:start position:0%
public hearing on SB

372 and uh welcome the very patient
 
04:20:30.040 --> 04:20:31.830 align:start position:0%

Senator

04:20:31.830 --> 04:20:31.840 align:start position:0%
Senator

04:20:47.070 --> 04:20:47.080 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman members of the committee
 
04:20:50.590 --> 04:20:50.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity my name is
 
04:20:53.149 --> 04:20:53.159 align:start position:0%
Senator Murphy I represent the people of
 
04:20:55.269 --> 04:20:55.279 align:start position:0%
gtown hookit candy Raymond and
 
04:20:57.590 --> 04:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
Manchester's First
 
04:20:59.469 --> 04:20:59.479 align:start position:0%
Ward one of the strengths of our
 
04:21:02.149 --> 04:21:02.159 align:start position:0%
legislature is that we are not paid
 
04:21:04.349 --> 04:21:04.359 align:start position:0%
$75,000 to be here as much as that might
 
04:21:06.670 --> 04:21:06.680 align:start position:0%
be we all have had careers in the past
 
04:21:09.229 --> 04:21:09.239 align:start position:0%
or have careers now and one of my
 
04:21:11.309 --> 04:21:11.319 align:start position:0%
earlier careers was that I spent a year
 
04:21:14.229 --> 04:21:14.239 align:start position:0%
as a uh as electrician's Apprentice I
 
04:21:15.950 --> 04:21:15.960 align:start position:0%
spent a year crawling around ceilings
 
04:21:18.710 --> 04:21:18.720 align:start position:0%
and wiring up light fixtures and wiring
 
04:21:21.750 --> 04:21:21.760 align:start position:0%
um outlets and you know panels and all
 
04:21:23.510 --> 04:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
the things electricians do before I
 
04:21:25.149 --> 04:21:25.159 align:start position:0%
decided that that was not the career for
 
04:21:28.990 --> 04:21:29.000 align:start position:0%
me I was one of four apprentices under a
 
04:21:32.389 --> 04:21:32.399 align:start position:0%
master electrician when I was um in
 
04:21:35.429 --> 04:21:35.439 align:start position:0%
training and
 
04:21:39.750 --> 04:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
when I learned to my surprise uh that we
 
04:21:41.630 --> 04:21:41.640 align:start position:0%
have a maximum number of apprentice
 
04:21:41.640 --> 04:21:43.030 align:start position:0%
have a maximum number of apprentice
plumbers

04:21:43.030 --> 04:21:43.040 align:start position:0%
plumbers
 
04:21:46.790 --> 04:21:46.800 align:start position:0%
per master of one a ratio of one to
 
04:21:49.990 --> 04:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
one and I was very surprised because we
 
04:21:51.229 --> 04:21:51.239 align:start position:0%
all know there's a big problem with
 
04:21:53.389 --> 04:21:53.399 align:start position:0%
building in New Hampshire there's a it's
 
04:21:54.990 --> 04:21:55.000 align:start position:0%
Builders are finding it very challenging
 
04:21:57.389 --> 04:21:57.399 align:start position:0%
to get enough workers to build their uh
 
04:21:59.950 --> 04:21:59.960 align:start position:0%
the homes and we have a housing crisis
 
04:22:01.590 --> 04:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
in the state we all know that there's a
 
04:22:03.670 --> 04:22:03.680 align:start position:0%
number of factors why that's the case
 
04:22:06.149 --> 04:22:06.159 align:start position:0%
but a lack of talent and a lack of
 
04:22:07.670 --> 04:22:07.680 align:start position:0%
people in the trades is a big part of
 
04:22:09.790 --> 04:22:09.800 align:start position:0%
that so anything we can do to alleviate
 
04:22:11.349 --> 04:22:11.359 align:start position:0%
that bottleneck I think is something
 
04:22:13.870 --> 04:22:13.880 align:start position:0%
that we need to take a strong look at so
 
04:22:16.910 --> 04:22:16.920 align:start position:0%
this bill was put in and passed because
 
04:22:19.309 --> 04:22:19.319 align:start position:0%
we in the Senate believe that we can
 
04:22:21.149 --> 04:22:21.159 align:start position:0%
double the number of apprentices going
 
04:22:24.030 --> 04:22:24.040 align:start position:0%
to the process and that would be a a
 
04:22:26.990 --> 04:22:27.000 align:start position:0%
good thing to do a strong step to take
 
04:22:27.000 --> 04:22:28.910 align:start position:0%
good thing to do a strong step to take
um

04:22:28.910 --> 04:22:28.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:22:32.149 --> 04:22:32.159 align:start position:0%
the the bill hearing we had in the
 
04:22:34.910 --> 04:22:34.920 align:start position:0%
Senate uh revealed that this was
 
04:22:36.630 --> 04:22:36.640 align:start position:0%
actually a Federal Regulation there was
 
04:22:39.109 --> 04:22:39.119 align:start position:0%
a federal training program that we we
 
04:22:41.510 --> 04:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
could possibly be at risk of losing and
 
04:22:44.309 --> 04:22:44.319 align:start position:0%
so that's why the bill was uh changed to
 
04:22:47.309 --> 04:22:47.319 align:start position:0%
make the apprenticeship program optional
 
04:22:48.830 --> 04:22:48.840 align:start position:0%
if The Apprentice is registered in the
 
04:22:50.590 --> 04:22:50.600 align:start position:0%
federal program then it would have to
 
04:22:51.950 --> 04:22:51.960 align:start position:0%
comply with the Department of Labor
 
04:22:53.830 --> 04:22:53.840 align:start position:0%
which again does still require that one:
 
04:22:56.670 --> 04:22:56.680 align:start position:0%
one ratio that's a federal requirement
 
04:22:59.469 --> 04:22:59.479 align:start position:0%
not every state is in that program but
 
04:23:02.790 --> 04:23:02.800 align:start position:0%
we happen to be there um so the person
 
04:23:05.189 --> 04:23:05.199 align:start position:0%
doing the hiring the employer can choose
 
04:23:07.950 --> 04:23:07.960 align:start position:0%
to uh use the registered apprentices
 
04:23:09.950 --> 04:23:09.960 align:start position:0%
with Department of Labor or can choose
 
04:23:11.189 --> 04:23:11.199 align:start position:0%
simply to hire people and keep them
 
04:23:13.670 --> 04:23:13.680 align:start position:0%
outside of that program um I did pass
 
04:23:17.429 --> 04:23:17.439 align:start position:0%
out an amendment because after passage
 
04:23:20.710 --> 04:23:20.720 align:start position:0%
um we heard a concern that the language
 
04:23:24.229 --> 04:23:24.239 align:start position:0%
in the bill as passed
 
04:23:27.870 --> 04:23:27.880 align:start position:0%
was possibly open to uh reading it two
 
04:23:30.349 --> 04:23:30.359 align:start position:0%
different ways and so all this amendment
 
04:23:32.590 --> 04:23:32.600 align:start position:0%
does and I would hope you would pass it
 
04:23:36.030 --> 04:23:36.040 align:start position:0%
um is to clear up exactly what the
 
04:23:38.229 --> 04:23:38.239 align:start position:0%
initial bill what was meant to do
 
04:23:42.790 --> 04:23:42.800 align:start position:0%
clarify that um that a master plumber
 
04:23:46.070 --> 04:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
could have no more than two par liy not
 
04:23:48.830 --> 04:23:48.840 align:start position:0%
a minimum of two which is the concern so
 
04:23:49.990 --> 04:23:50.000 align:start position:0%
and with that I'm happy to take any
 
04:23:52.269 --> 04:23:52.279 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much thank you
 
04:23:55.510 --> 04:23:55.520 align:start position:0%

04:24:55.830 --> 04:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
out the bill basically does three things
 
04:24:57.550 --> 04:24:57.560 align:start position:0%
it creates a new chapter for the
 
04:25:00.349 --> 04:25:00.359 align:start position:0%
Personnel appeals board it repeals six
 
04:25:02.469 --> 04:25:02.479 align:start position:0%
statutes related to the Department of
 
04:25:04.950 --> 04:25:04.960 align:start position:0%
administrative Services Division and the
 
04:25:07.309 --> 04:25:07.319 align:start position:0%
bill is a request from the Department of
 
04:25:07.319 --> 04:25:08.510 align:start position:0%
bill is a request from the Department of
administrative

04:25:08.510 --> 04:25:08.520 align:start position:0%
administrative
 
04:25:10.750 --> 04:25:10.760 align:start position:0%
Services um just a little background
 
04:25:12.630 --> 04:25:12.640 align:start position:0%
about the administrative Appeals board
 
04:25:15.269 --> 04:25:15.279 align:start position:0%
ad hears appeals from state employees
 
04:25:17.630 --> 04:25:17.640 align:start position:0%
who believe an application of the New
 
04:25:19.189 --> 04:25:19.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Personnel rules have been
 
04:25:21.750 --> 04:25:21.760 align:start position:0%
taken wrongly against them most often
 
04:25:24.070 --> 04:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
these cases are appeals of disciplinary
 
04:25:26.189 --> 04:25:26.199 align:start position:0%
actions such as letters of warning or
 
04:25:28.870 --> 04:25:28.880 align:start position:0%
termination from state employee
 
04:25:31.790 --> 04:25:31.800 align:start position:0%
currently the board is administratively
 
04:25:33.830 --> 04:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
attached to the division of personnel
 
04:25:36.790 --> 04:25:36.800 align:start position:0%
within administrative Services it shares
 
04:25:39.030 --> 04:25:39.040 align:start position:0%
administrative staff who are employed
 
04:25:41.389 --> 04:25:41.399 align:start position:0%
and supervised by the division of
 
04:25:44.870 --> 04:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
personnel the board's operating expenses
 
04:25:47.189 --> 04:25:47.199 align:start position:0%
are also managed by the division of
 
04:25:49.750 --> 04:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
personnel at times the administrative
 
04:25:51.389 --> 04:25:51.399 align:start position:0%
attachment with the division of
 
04:25:53.149 --> 04:25:53.159 align:start position:0%
personnel can cause a conflict of
 
04:25:56.189 --> 04:25:56.199 align:start position:0%
interest by managing uh the board
 
04:25:58.149 --> 04:25:58.159 align:start position:0%
operations but more importantly on
 
04:26:00.710 --> 04:26:00.720 align:start position:0%
decisions the boards the board makes in
 
04:26:03.950 --> 04:26:03.960 align:start position:0%
appeals of employees all question all
 
04:26:06.070 --> 04:26:06.080 align:start position:0%
cases question the decisions made by
 
04:26:08.710 --> 04:26:08.720 align:start position:0%
direct employees and
 
04:26:11.630 --> 04:26:11.640 align:start position:0%
ultimately the division of personnel
 
04:26:13.550 --> 04:26:13.560 align:start position:0%
it's not on common for the director of
 
04:26:15.469 --> 04:26:15.479 align:start position:0%
the division of personnel or even the
 
04:26:17.269 --> 04:26:17.279 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the Department of
 
04:26:19.670 --> 04:26:19.680 align:start position:0%
administrative services to be mentioned
 
04:26:21.870 --> 04:26:21.880 align:start position:0%
in disciplinary documents that come in
 
04:26:23.950 --> 04:26:23.960 align:start position:0%
front of the board that means the
 
04:26:25.429 --> 04:26:25.439 align:start position:0%
director of personnel or the
 
04:26:27.469 --> 04:26:27.479 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the department could be
 
04:26:29.630 --> 04:26:29.640 align:start position:0%
Witnesses before the
 
04:26:32.630 --> 04:26:32.640 align:start position:0%
board given their role in administering
 
04:26:34.750 --> 04:26:34.760 align:start position:0%
the board's budget and staff the
 
04:26:36.950 --> 04:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
potential conflict of interest is
 
04:26:40.790 --> 04:26:40.800 align:start position:0%
apparent Senate Bill 487 dissolves the
 
04:26:42.990 --> 04:26:43.000 align:start position:0%
the existing administrative
 
04:26:45.550 --> 04:26:45.560 align:start position:0%
attachment to the division of personnel
 
04:26:48.189 --> 04:26:48.199 align:start position:0%
and reorganizes the Personnel appeals
 
04:26:51.349 --> 04:26:51.359 align:start position:0%
board as a full an entity fully
 
04:26:53.309 --> 04:26:53.319 align:start position:0%
independent from the division of
 
04:26:56.109 --> 04:26:56.119 align:start position:0%
personnel as well as other state
 
04:26:59.630 --> 04:26:59.640 align:start position:0%
agencies um sen 487 does have a fiscal
 
04:27:02.309 --> 04:27:02.319 align:start position:0%
impact of approximately
 
04:27:04.189 --> 04:27:04.199 align:start position:0%
$253,000 in
 
04:27:06.469 --> 04:27:06.479 align:start position:0%
2025 and
 
04:27:08.349 --> 04:27:08.359 align:start position:0%
35,000 in
 
04:27:11.109 --> 04:27:11.119 align:start position:0%
2026 it also establishes a fund for
 
04:27:13.790 --> 04:27:13.800 align:start position:0%
basic operating expensive part-time
 
04:27:16.349 --> 04:27:16.359 align:start position:0%
Staffing parking office space equipment
 
04:27:18.830 --> 04:27:18.840 align:start position:0%
and supplies um at this point Mr
 
04:27:22.910 --> 04:27:22.920 align:start position:0%
chairman I will uh conclude my testimony
 
04:27:25.109 --> 04:27:25.119 align:start position:0%
and someone from the Department is here
 
04:27:29.830 --> 04:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
to go into detail um we did have a very
 
04:27:33.229 --> 04:27:33.239 align:start position:0%
uh good public hearing we did have some
 
04:27:35.790 --> 04:27:35.800 align:start position:0%
conflicts that uh the parties were able
 
04:27:39.670 --> 04:27:39.680 align:start position:0%
to get together and resolve so the bill
 
04:27:42.189 --> 04:27:42.199 align:start position:0%
that you see as amended by the Senate
 
04:27:44.950 --> 04:27:44.960 align:start position:0%
really speaks to a compromise between
 
04:27:48.389 --> 04:27:48.399 align:start position:0%
state employees labor attorneys and the
 
04:27:51.790 --> 04:27:51.800 align:start position:0%
department of administrative services so
 
04:27:53.429 --> 04:27:53.439 align:start position:0%

said that um something about it being
 
04:28:21.790 --> 04:28:21.800 align:start position:0%
independent but it's in uh 273 which is
 
04:28:23.229 --> 04:28:23.239 align:start position:0%
under labor so is it actually going to
 
04:28:26.429 --> 04:28:26.439 align:start position:0%

of the committee appreciate you taking a
 
04:29:36.189 --> 04:29:36.199 align:start position:0%
time today in considering this bill my
 
04:29:37.990 --> 04:29:38.000 align:start position:0%
name is m MAV George I'm the deputy
 
04:29:40.229 --> 04:29:40.239 align:start position:0%
director of personnel at the department
 
04:29:42.510 --> 04:29:42.520 align:start position:0%
of administrative services and as
 
04:29:44.309 --> 04:29:44.319 align:start position:0%
Senator Carson said first of all I'd
 
04:29:45.670 --> 04:29:45.680 align:start position:0%
like to thank Senator Carson for
 
04:29:48.070 --> 04:29:48.080 align:start position:0%
sponsoring this bill um it's been an
 
04:29:50.070 --> 04:29:50.080 align:start position:0%
effort to get this across the finish
 
04:29:52.429 --> 04:29:52.439 align:start position:0%
line but we appreciate the collaborative
 
04:29:54.590 --> 04:29:54.600 align:start position:0%
approach we've had with both the
 
04:29:56.510 --> 04:29:56.520 align:start position:0%
president or chair of the Personnel
 
04:29:58.389 --> 04:29:58.399 align:start position:0%
appeals board and the unions we all
 
04:30:01.109 --> 04:30:01.119 align:start position:0%
worked uh collaboratively on this
 
04:30:03.550 --> 04:30:03.560 align:start position:0%
amendment to uh get it to where it is
 
04:30:05.990 --> 04:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
today and we all agree that the current
 
04:30:09.269 --> 04:30:09.279 align:start position:0%
amended version of the bill is um a
 
04:30:10.790 --> 04:30:10.800 align:start position:0%
version that we can live with at this
 
04:30:13.910 --> 04:30:13.920 align:start position:0%
time and and we were all doing so in the
 
04:30:15.710 --> 04:30:15.720 align:start position:0%
spirit of the ultimate goal of the bill
 
04:30:17.790 --> 04:30:17.800 align:start position:0%
which is to get the Personnel appeals
 
04:30:21.469 --> 04:30:21.479 align:start position:0%
board uh separated and truly independent
 
04:30:23.269 --> 04:30:23.279 align:start position:0%
that being said uh the Department
 
04:30:25.710 --> 04:30:25.720 align:start position:0%
administrative services and the unions
 
04:30:28.630 --> 04:30:28.640 align:start position:0%
did have some uh substantive things that
 
04:30:31.070 --> 04:30:31.080 align:start position:0%
they would like to reserve the right to
 
04:30:32.590 --> 04:30:32.600 align:start position:0%
uh take up at maybe at a future
 
04:30:34.469 --> 04:30:34.479 align:start position:0%
legislative session but we felt that the
 
04:30:36.109 --> 04:30:36.119 align:start position:0%
time wasn't right with this bill to
 
04:30:38.910 --> 04:30:38.920 align:start position:0%
necessarily Advance those issues at this
 
04:30:41.510 --> 04:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
time be happy to take any questions at
 
04:30:43.109 --> 04:30:43.119 align:start position:0%
any m MERS of the committee might have
 
04:30:45.670 --> 04:30:45.680 align:start position:0%
regarding this bill representative
 
04:30:49.670 --> 04:30:49.680 align:start position:0%
leas um first my uh question from before
 
04:30:51.790 --> 04:30:51.800 align:start position:0%
and that this is in the part of Statute
 
04:30:57.389 --> 04:30:57.399 align:start position:0%
under the uh uh Department of Labor and
 
04:30:59.710 --> 04:30:59.720 align:start position:0%
is it part of the Department of Labor or
 
04:31:02.189 --> 04:31:02.199 align:start position:0%
what does independent mean who who they
 
04:31:04.750 --> 04:31:04.760 align:start position:0%
who's responsible for it sure they will
 
04:31:06.309 --> 04:31:06.319 align:start position:0%
not be part of the Department of Labor
 
04:31:08.149 --> 04:31:08.159 align:start position:0%
it it sits very similar to like the
 
04:31:10.990 --> 04:31:11.000 align:start position:0%
Personnel not Personnel the uh Public
 
04:31:13.750 --> 04:31:13.760 align:start position:0%
Employee labors relation board which is
 
04:31:15.790 --> 04:31:15.800 align:start position:0%
another truly independent entity in the
 
04:31:17.309 --> 04:31:17.319 align:start position:0%
state they don't they're not
 
04:31:19.149 --> 04:31:19.159 align:start position:0%
administratively attached or affiliated
 
04:31:21.590 --> 04:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
with any other state agency and if this
 
04:31:23.309 --> 04:31:23.319 align:start position:0%
bill were to pass the Personnel appeals
 
04:31:25.349 --> 04:31:25.359 align:start position:0%
board would operate very similarly it's
 
04:31:27.070 --> 04:31:27.080 align:start position:0%
just where it lands in the structure of
 
04:31:29.670 --> 04:31:29.680 align:start position:0%
the chapter laws follow up follow up so
 
04:31:31.950 --> 04:31:31.960 align:start position:0%
are they basically I mean under the
 
04:31:34.109 --> 04:31:34.119 align:start position:0%
governor directly is that either one of
 
04:31:36.870 --> 04:31:36.880 align:start position:0%
those is that uh right they would just
 
04:31:39.429 --> 04:31:39.439 align:start position:0%
be like any other state agency and some
 
04:31:40.830 --> 04:31:40.840 align:start position:0%
of them are much smaller than others
 
04:31:42.830 --> 04:31:42.840 align:start position:0%
some state agencies are very small and
 
04:31:44.309 --> 04:31:44.319 align:start position:0%
this would just be like another example
 
04:31:46.389 --> 04:31:46.399 align:start position:0%
of that reporting directly up and
 
04:31:48.269 --> 04:31:48.279 align:start position:0%
hopefully one more follow up if I could
 
04:31:52.429 --> 04:31:52.439 align:start position:0%
okay so um other than what what it sits
 
04:31:54.830 --> 04:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
under is the structure of this basically
 
04:31:57.229 --> 04:31:57.239 align:start position:0%
the same as the existing board or is
 
04:31:59.870 --> 04:31:59.880 align:start position:0%
there some some changes are there some
 
04:32:01.309 --> 04:32:01.319 align:start position:0%
changes as far as the makeup of the
 
04:32:03.750 --> 04:32:03.760 align:start position:0%
board how it operates right yeah the
 
04:32:06.189 --> 04:32:06.199 align:start position:0%
majority of the language is almost
 
04:32:08.750 --> 04:32:08.760 align:start position:0%
identical to the current version of the
 
04:32:10.590 --> 04:32:10.600 align:start position:0%
Personnel appeals board as far as how it
 
04:32:12.910 --> 04:32:12.920 align:start position:0%
sits deal only difference is right now
 
04:32:15.109 --> 04:32:15.119 align:start position:0%
it sits in the chapter laws for the
 
04:32:17.269 --> 04:32:17.279 align:start position:0%
Department administrative services this
 
04:32:18.750 --> 04:32:18.760 align:start position:0%
would take it out of that that's why it
 
04:32:20.429 --> 04:32:20.439 align:start position:0%
repeals a number of sections of the
 
04:32:22.790 --> 04:32:22.800 align:start position:0%
current law and sticks it in its own
 
04:32:25.269 --> 04:32:25.279 align:start position:0%
section gives it its own operating
 
04:32:27.910 --> 04:32:27.920 align:start position:0%
budget and staff that's really the main
 
04:32:31.309 --> 04:32:31.319 align:start position:0%
difference okay thank you representative
 
04:32:33.590 --> 04:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
welcome that your question represent
 
04:32:36.070 --> 04:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
Brown thank you Mr chair uh thanks for
 
04:32:39.109 --> 04:32:39.119 align:start position:0%
taking my question um on line
 
04:32:41.950 --> 04:32:41.960 align:start position:0%
10 it says at least one member shall be
 
04:32:43.670 --> 04:32:43.680 align:start position:0%
an attorney licensed to practice in the
 
04:32:44.750 --> 04:32:44.760 align:start position:0%
state of New
 
04:32:47.590 --> 04:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and an additional requirements
 
04:32:48.910 --> 04:32:48.920 align:start position:0%
experience in the conduct of
 
04:32:50.429 --> 04:32:50.439 align:start position:0%
adjudicative hearings and decision
 
04:32:53.070 --> 04:32:53.080 align:start position:0%
writing on line 16 it says both the
 
04:32:54.910 --> 04:32:54.920 align:start position:0%
chairperson and vice chairperson shall
 
04:32:57.309 --> 04:32:57.319 align:start position:0%
be attorneys is there an inconsistency
 
04:32:59.229 --> 04:32:59.239 align:start position:0%
there so should it say there should be
 
04:33:02.670 --> 04:33:02.680 align:start position:0%
two attorneys or is it
 
04:33:06.230 --> 04:33:06.240 align:start position:0%
that is it that that first attorney has
 
04:33:07.910 --> 04:33:07.920 align:start position:0%
to be experienced in adjudicative
 
04:33:12.470 --> 04:33:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:13.789 --> 04:33:13.799 align:start position:0%
I see what you're saying yeah
 
04:33:15.189 --> 04:33:15.199 align:start position:0%
representative that that's a fair point
 
04:33:16.750 --> 04:33:16.760 align:start position:0%
I think that's something that could be
 
04:33:18.230 --> 04:33:18.240 align:start position:0%
addressed pretty easily and make the
 
04:33:20.590 --> 04:33:20.600 align:start position:0%
requirement uh that it be at least two
 
04:33:23.869 --> 04:33:23.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:26.949 --> 04:33:26.959 align:start position:0%
you I suppose at least one is
 
04:33:30.670 --> 04:33:30.680 align:start position:0%
potentially two
 
04:33:34.029 --> 04:33:34.039 align:start position:0%
but yeah any other questions y could be
 
04:33:35.910 --> 04:33:35.920 align:start position:0%
a way to read it consistently the two
 
04:33:35.920 --> 04:33:37.189 align:start position:0%
a way to read it consistently the two
but

04:33:37.189 --> 04:33:37.199 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:33:39.390 --> 04:33:39.400 align:start position:0%
yeah you helped me out last week I'm
 
04:33:39.400 --> 04:33:43.269 align:start position:0%
yeah you helped me out last week I'm
just

04:33:43.269 --> 04:33:43.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:45.070 --> 04:33:45.080 align:start position:0%
uh I see no further questions thank you
 
04:33:46.510 --> 04:33:46.520 align:start position:0%
very much for your testimony sure thank
 
04:33:47.949 --> 04:33:47.959 align:start position:0%

speak on S SP 487 director are you
 
04:33:51.429 --> 04:33:51.439 align:start position:0%
speaking on this one I didn't think so
 
04:33:52.910 --> 04:33:52.920 align:start position:0%
it didn't seem like your sort of thing
 
04:33:54.189 --> 04:33:54.199 align:start position:0%
having said that I will close the public
 
04:33:57.750 --> 04:33:57.760 align:start position:0%
hearing on S SP 487 and we made it you
 
04:34:02.789 --> 04:34:02.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:10.709 --> 04:34:10.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:43.830 --> 04:34:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:46.269 --> 04:34:46.279 align:start position:0%
um didn't we have a time set aside
 
04:34:48.869 --> 04:34:48.879 align:start position:0%
tomorrow if we had to follow up didn't
 
04:34:54.750 --> 04:34:54.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:03.429 --> 04:35:03.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:08.189 --> 04:35:08.199 align:start position:0%
apolog thank you thank you thank you so
 
04:35:10.910 --> 04:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 134 does somebody have a
 
04:35:10.920 --> 04:35:12.789 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 134 does somebody have a
motion

04:35:12.789 --> 04:35:12.799 align:start position:0%
motion
 
04:35:14.109 --> 04:35:14.119 align:start position:0%
a to
 
04:35:17.070 --> 04:35:17.080 align:start position:0%
pass okay representative Schmidt moves
 
04:35:20.269 --> 04:35:20.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:23.029 --> 04:35:23.039 align:start position:0%
pass and representative gold second did
 
04:35:26.230 --> 04:35:26.240 align:start position:0%
you wish to speak to your motion I do
 
04:35:28.429 --> 04:35:28.439 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
04:35:32.990 --> 04:35:33.000 align:start position:0%
so um I was astonished by the testimony
 
04:35:35.150 --> 04:35:35.160 align:start position:0%
we heard on this
 
04:35:38.830 --> 04:35:38.840 align:start position:0%
bill and crestfallen to realize that it
 
04:35:42.590 --> 04:35:42.600 align:start position:0%
could be possible in this state
 
04:35:47.269 --> 04:35:47.279 align:start position:0%
to have police officers who faced
 
04:35:50.150 --> 04:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
gunfire and were not merely facing
 
04:35:54.269 --> 04:35:54.279 align:start position:0%
gunfire but were shot multiple
 
04:35:57.709 --> 04:35:57.719 align:start position:0%
times and were
 
04:36:01.429 --> 04:36:01.439 align:start position:0%
miraculously not killed on the
 
04:36:06.750 --> 04:36:06.760 align:start position:0%
spot and if we can put
 
04:36:09.830 --> 04:36:09.840 align:start position:0%
$100,000 on the line for fallen
 
04:36:12.349 --> 04:36:12.359 align:start position:0%
firefighters or police off
 
04:36:12.359 --> 04:36:14.150 align:start position:0%
firefighters or police off
officers

04:36:14.150 --> 04:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
officers
 
04:36:16.789 --> 04:36:16.799 align:start position:0%
um and
 
04:36:21.070 --> 04:36:21.080 align:start position:0%
not something similar
 
04:36:26.230 --> 04:36:26.240 align:start position:0%
for uh people who are shot but survive
 
04:36:30.789 --> 04:36:30.799 align:start position:0%
or run over by vehicles and survive then
 
04:36:33.150 --> 04:36:33.160 align:start position:0%
I think that we ought to do what this
 
04:36:35.310 --> 04:36:35.320 align:start position:0%
bill I don't know whether the bill is
 
04:36:37.949 --> 04:36:37.959 align:start position:0%
any good in terms of its mechanics but
 
04:36:39.910 --> 04:36:39.920 align:start position:0%
you guys are going to tell me
 
04:36:42.429 --> 04:36:42.439 align:start position:0%
that thank you representative gold do
 
04:36:44.189 --> 04:36:44.199 align:start position:0%
you wish to speak to your second thank
 
04:36:46.109 --> 04:36:46.119 align:start position:0%
you madam chair I I agree with
 
04:36:48.189 --> 04:36:48.199 align:start position:0%
everything my colleague said and I'll
 
04:36:52.230 --> 04:36:52.240 align:start position:0%
just add uh with all of the concerns we
 
04:36:55.470 --> 04:36:55.480 align:start position:0%
all hear and we all share about PTSD and
 
04:36:58.070 --> 04:36:58.080 align:start position:0%
our First Responders all I needed to
 
04:37:00.670 --> 04:37:00.680 align:start position:0%
hear was our statute State they are
 
04:37:03.670 --> 04:37:03.680 align:start position:0%
worth more dead than
 
04:37:06.709 --> 04:37:06.719 align:start position:0%
alive represent blackis I'm certainly
 
04:37:08.709 --> 04:37:08.719 align:start position:0%
not opposed to this and I support what
 
04:37:10.230 --> 04:37:10.240 align:start position:0%
it's trying to do I just feel more
 
04:37:12.029 --> 04:37:12.039 align:start position:0%
comfortable voting for it not saying I
 
04:37:16.429 --> 04:37:16.439 align:start position:0%
won't if I had some kind of a realistic
 
04:37:18.390 --> 04:37:18.400 align:start position:0%
fiscal note I'm and the reason I'm
 
04:37:20.750 --> 04:37:20.760 align:start position:0%
concerned is the existing one is so
 
04:37:24.029 --> 04:37:24.039 align:start position:0%
large and looking at the changes it's
 
04:37:27.150 --> 04:37:27.160 align:start position:0%
not clear to me why it would be
 
04:37:27.160 --> 04:37:29.750 align:start position:0%
not clear to me why it would be
dramatically

04:37:29.750 --> 04:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
dramatically
 
04:37:32.551 --> 04:37:32.561 align:start position:0%
less I don't know I'd like to comment on
 
04:37:35.551 --> 04:37:35.561 align:start position:0%
that because I was listening to the to
 
04:37:38.150 --> 04:37:38.160 align:start position:0%
Mr Carlin and the other people speaking
 
04:37:41.949 --> 04:37:41.959 align:start position:0%
about the cost apparently when they did
 
04:37:43.629 --> 04:37:43.639 align:start position:0%
the first
 
04:37:46.789 --> 04:37:46.799 align:start position:0%
estimate they were incredibly
 
04:37:48.551 --> 04:37:48.561 align:start position:0%
conservative on how many people this
 
04:37:51.949 --> 04:37:51.959 align:start position:0%
would apply to and they were also
 
04:37:54.070 --> 04:37:54.080 align:start position:0%
working from the first version of the
 
04:37:56.470 --> 04:37:56.480 align:start position:0%
bill which had a lot of factors that
 
04:38:00.990 --> 04:38:01.000 align:start position:0%
this one doesn't at the moment the cost
 
04:38:04.429 --> 04:38:04.439 align:start position:0%
is some reprogramming at the retirement
 
04:38:06.349 --> 04:38:06.359 align:start position:0%
system of
 
04:38:09.029 --> 04:38:09.039 align:start position:0%
course the difference between their
 
04:38:12.470 --> 04:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
current pension and
 
04:38:16.189 --> 04:38:16.199 align:start position:0%
$75,000 for the two individuals who have
 
04:38:20.070 --> 04:38:20.080 align:start position:0%
been identified plus $11,000 a month
 
04:38:25.150 --> 04:38:25.160 align:start position:0%
for medical uh benefits so
 
04:38:28.629 --> 04:38:28.639 align:start position:0%
approximately it may be as much as
 
04:38:32.990 --> 04:38:33.000 align:start position:0%
$100,000 a year for each of two people
 
04:38:36.189 --> 04:38:36.199 align:start position:0%
and considering the limitations on what
 
04:38:37.109 --> 04:38:37.119 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
04:38:40.029 --> 04:38:40.039 align:start position:0%
a an event would allow somebody to
 
04:38:42.470 --> 04:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
qualify for this I can't think that it's
 
04:38:44.189 --> 04:38:44.199 align:start position:0%
going to be a I mean they must have been
 
04:38:45.910 --> 04:38:45.920 align:start position:0%
assuming that vast numbers of police
 
04:38:48.189 --> 04:38:48.199 align:start position:0%
officers are going to get shot so and
 
04:38:50.670 --> 04:38:50.680 align:start position:0%
since we don't think that's the case we
 
04:38:53.709 --> 04:38:53.719 align:start position:0%
pray that's not the case it's it can't
 
04:38:56.230 --> 04:38:56.240 align:start position:0%
be that as much as is in the fiscal note
 
04:38:58.429 --> 04:38:58.439 align:start position:0%
the fiscal notes also based on the
 
04:39:01.189 --> 04:39:01.199 align:start position:0%
unamended bill which was different have
 
04:39:01.199 --> 04:39:03.269 align:start position:0%
unamended bill which was different have
you

04:39:03.269 --> 04:39:03.279 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:39:07.551 --> 04:39:07.561 align:start position:0%
yes very quickly so when this when the
 
04:39:11.750 --> 04:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
original bill came in with regard to um
 
04:39:15.990 --> 04:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
$100,000 for dead firefighters of police
 
04:39:18.789 --> 04:39:18.799 align:start position:0%
officers we initially looked at the
 
04:39:22.429 --> 04:39:22.439 align:start position:0%
funding mechanism Diane you'll remember
 
04:39:26.029 --> 04:39:26.039 align:start position:0%
um and it was you know we decided that
 
04:39:28.470 --> 04:39:28.480 align:start position:0%
the insurance policy was going to be
 
04:39:31.629 --> 04:39:31.639 align:start position:0%
more expensive to than just paying for
 
04:39:34.349 --> 04:39:34.359 align:start position:0%
it out of the general fund and we
 
04:39:36.109 --> 04:39:36.119 align:start position:0%
changed it to funding through out of the
 
04:39:39.150 --> 04:39:39.160 align:start position:0%
general fund and it's it's never the
 
04:39:42.628 --> 04:39:42.638 align:start position:0%
issue has never been raised again
 
04:39:42.638 --> 04:39:43.750 align:start position:0%
issue has never been raised again
representative

04:39:43.750 --> 04:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:39:46.470 --> 04:39:46.480 align:start position:0%
Shu thank you madam chair uh I would
 
04:39:50.190 --> 04:39:50.200 align:start position:0%
just point out that um we are all aware
 
04:39:51.948 --> 04:39:51.958 align:start position:0%
of the law enforcement
 
04:39:54.110 --> 04:39:54.120 align:start position:0%
memorial uh out in front of this
 
04:39:57.510 --> 04:39:57.520 align:start position:0%
building and most officers that are
 
04:40:00.110 --> 04:40:00.120 align:start position:0%
injured in this manner are no longer
 
04:40:02.510 --> 04:40:02.520 align:start position:0%
with us so I think we owe it to those
 
04:40:06.948 --> 04:40:06.958 align:start position:0%
that do happen to survive to do this for
 
04:40:10.310 --> 04:40:10.320 align:start position:0%
them repres laus yeah so and I'm not
 
04:40:12.708 --> 04:40:12.718 align:start position:0%
arguing against that um I just if I'm
 
04:40:13.628 --> 04:40:13.638 align:start position:0%
going to vote for it I want to feel a
 
04:40:15.830 --> 04:40:15.840 align:start position:0%
little comfortable about this one is so
 
04:40:17.670 --> 04:40:17.680 align:start position:0%
they what we're thinking is maybe a
 
04:40:19.708 --> 04:40:19.718 align:start position:0%
couple hundred, and hopefully not much
 
04:40:22.390 --> 04:40:22.400 align:start position:0%
in the future um would just be out of
 
04:40:24.990 --> 04:40:25.000 align:start position:0%
the retirement system um what isn't
 
04:40:26.510 --> 04:40:26.520 align:start position:0%
clear to me is where does the money for
 
04:40:28.830 --> 04:40:28.840 align:start position:0%
the medical insurance part come from is
 
04:40:30.868 --> 04:40:30.878 align:start position:0%
that general f that's also from the
 
04:40:33.550 --> 04:40:33.560 align:start position:0%
retirement system it's they have a
 
04:40:36.708 --> 04:40:36.718 align:start position:0%
medical uh medical subsidy that's
 
04:40:39.310 --> 04:40:39.320 align:start position:0%
limited to a small number of people okay
 
04:40:44.590 --> 04:40:44.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:47.350 --> 04:40:47.360 align:start position:0%
represent goalie thank you madam chair
 
04:40:49.670 --> 04:40:49.680 align:start position:0%
and that medical subsidy I believe is
 
04:40:52.230 --> 04:40:52.240 align:start position:0%
tied to the um normal costs when they
 
04:40:56.110 --> 04:40:56.120 align:start position:0%
figure it in going forward y um but if I
 
04:40:59.670 --> 04:40:59.680 align:start position:0%
may um I just specifically want to thank
 
04:41:02.070 --> 04:41:02.080 align:start position:0%
um Mr dhy and Mr Lewis for their
 
04:41:03.868 --> 04:41:03.878 align:start position:0%
services that they provided being from
 
04:41:05.550 --> 04:41:05.560 align:start position:0%
Manchester and working 32 and half years
 
04:41:08.990 --> 04:41:09.000 align:start position:0%
on the fire department side by side um I
 
04:41:10.230 --> 04:41:10.240 align:start position:0%
appreciate it and thank you very much
 
04:41:11.750 --> 04:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
and thank you for bringing this forward
 
04:41:14.830 --> 04:41:14.840 align:start position:0%
I hope it helps and it goes
 
04:41:17.510 --> 04:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
forward I'd like to to say that we
 
04:41:21.150 --> 04:41:21.160 align:start position:0%
should look very hard at why Timeout on
 
04:41:23.948 --> 04:41:23.958 align:start position:0%
workers compensation doesn't count
 
04:41:27.670 --> 04:41:27.680 align:start position:0%
toward one's pension because if you're
 
04:41:31.750 --> 04:41:31.760 align:start position:0%
injured or hurt on the job for any
 
04:41:35.750 --> 04:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
reason you you you can't work I mean and
 
04:41:38.030 --> 04:41:38.040 align:start position:0%
it should be creditable and I think
 
04:41:39.708 --> 04:41:39.718 align:start position:0%
that's something to look into for next
 
04:41:39.718 --> 04:41:41.470 align:start position:0%
that's something to look into for next
year

04:41:41.470 --> 04:41:41.480 align:start position:0%
year
 
04:41:43.750 --> 04:41:43.760 align:start position:0%
anyone else repr Simon I was just going
 
04:41:45.150 --> 04:41:45.160 align:start position:0%
to say I agree with that Madam chair I
 
04:41:48.070 --> 04:41:48.080 align:start position:0%
was hoping we were under too um too much
 
04:41:49.190 --> 04:41:49.200 align:start position:0%
of a time crunch but I was hoping to be
 
04:41:52.070 --> 04:41:52.080 align:start position:0%
able to fit that into this this one but
 
04:41:54.708 --> 04:41:54.718 align:start position:0%
uh yeah we'll look at it for next
 
04:41:58.470 --> 04:41:58.480 align:start position:0%
year okay anyone
 
04:42:00.910 --> 04:42:00.920 align:start position:0%
else all right in that case a motion is
 
04:42:03.550 --> 04:42:03.560 align:start position:0%
ought to pass by representative
 
04:42:06.310 --> 04:42:06.320 align:start position:0%

04:42:08.350 --> 04:42:08.360 align:start position:0%

be on consent
 
04:42:44.110 --> 04:42:44.120 align:start position:0%

early

04:42:58.270 --> 04:42:58.280 align:start position:0%
early
 
04:42:58.280 --> 04:43:02.270 align:start position:0%
early
Bill

04:43:02.270 --> 04:43:02.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:07.110 --> 04:43:07.120 align:start position:0%
and as mentioned okay thank you thank
 
04:43:09.750 --> 04:43:09.760 align:start position:0%
you um I
 
04:43:13.190 --> 04:43:13.200 align:start position:0%
had while I was was watching the
 
04:43:17.070 --> 04:43:17.080 align:start position:0%
watching you guys work the real estate
 
04:43:21.990 --> 04:43:22.000 align:start position:0%
board s or the the association suggested
 
04:43:26.868 --> 04:43:26.878 align:start position:0%
that we delete sections one and four
 
04:43:28.708 --> 04:43:28.718 align:start position:0%
which are
 
04:43:31.190 --> 04:43:31.200 align:start position:0%
the the Troublesome
 
04:43:35.628 --> 04:43:35.638 align:start position:0%
parts and simply pass sections two and
 
04:43:38.510 --> 04:43:38.520 align:start position:0%
three which they need to as soon as
 
04:43:41.190 --> 04:43:41.200 align:start position:0%
possible um one one addition to that is
 
04:43:42.868 --> 04:43:42.878 align:start position:0%
there was a comment I think they made
 
04:43:46.350 --> 04:43:46.360 align:start position:0%
about the date in section 2 moving it
 
04:43:49.948 --> 04:43:49.958 align:start position:0%
from 2020 to 2024 so we don't change the
 
04:43:52.350 --> 04:43:52.360 align:start position:0%
requirements underneath people at least
 
04:43:54.470 --> 04:43:54.480 align:start position:0%
that was my
 
04:43:54.480 --> 04:43:57.788 align:start position:0%
that was my
understanding

04:43:57.788 --> 04:43:57.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:02.110 --> 04:44:02.120 align:start position:0%
okay the the post licensing is I believe
 
04:44:05.750 --> 04:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
a reference to a a some language in the
 
04:44:09.110 --> 04:44:09.120 align:start position:0%
rule that allows the board to
 
04:44:11.708 --> 04:44:11.718 align:start position:0%
specify different
 
04:44:13.670 --> 04:44:13.680 align:start position:0%
training continuing education
 
04:44:18.590 --> 04:44:18.600 align:start position:0%
requirements for new new uh real estate
 
04:44:21.390 --> 04:44:21.400 align:start position:0%
agents that don't apply to more senior
 
04:44:24.230 --> 04:44:24.240 align:start position:0%
people so in their first year they have
 
04:44:26.430 --> 04:44:26.440 align:start position:0%
specific training
 
04:44:29.590 --> 04:44:29.600 align:start position:0%
requirements and so is there any reason
 
04:44:31.708 --> 04:44:31.718 align:start position:0%
for it to be earlier than
 
04:44:36.070 --> 04:44:36.080 align:start position:0%
24 a little fuzzy on that I don't think
 
04:44:38.628 --> 04:44:38.638 align:start position:0%
so yeah that's what they asked for
 
04:44:41.868 --> 04:44:41.878 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that right so represent
 
04:44:44.310 --> 04:44:44.320 align:start position:0%
so if we have an amendment to this bill
 
04:44:47.430 --> 04:44:47.440 align:start position:0%
that only includes that section does
 
04:44:49.270 --> 04:44:49.280 align:start position:0%
that remove it from an early bill
 
04:44:51.830 --> 04:44:51.840 align:start position:0%
because there's no fiscal note now no no
 
04:44:53.750 --> 04:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
no it's if it's an early bill it's an
 
04:44:55.628 --> 04:44:55.638 align:start position:0%
early Bill even if you change it into a
 
04:44:57.590 --> 04:44:57.600 align:start position:0%
study committee I think the issue is
 
04:44:59.910 --> 04:44:59.920 align:start position:0%
that we we can't guarantee that the
 
04:45:02.510 --> 04:45:02.520 align:start position:0%
house will accept the amendment and so
 
04:45:04.030 --> 04:45:04.040 align:start position:0%
we can't be sure it won't have a big
 
04:45:07.350 --> 04:45:07.360 align:start position:0%
fiscal note oh I mean we can assume but
 
04:45:10.350 --> 04:45:10.360 align:start position:0%
we can't guarantee it technically also
 
04:45:12.030 --> 04:45:12.040 align:start position:0%
the system is not set up for that kind
 
04:45:14.750 --> 04:45:14.760 align:start position:0%
of flexibility it once an early Bill
 
04:45:16.910 --> 04:45:16.920 align:start position:0%
always an early
 
04:45:20.030 --> 04:45:20.040 align:start position:0%
bill but we're saying that we only want
 
04:45:24.550 --> 04:45:24.560 align:start position:0%
to have section two and three and three
 
04:45:26.070 --> 04:45:26.080 align:start position:0%
right and that's what the amendment
 
04:45:29.070 --> 04:45:29.080 align:start position:0%
would would recognize correct correct
 
04:45:31.590 --> 04:45:31.600 align:start position:0%
and change the date on line 13 right and
 
04:45:33.310 --> 04:45:33.320 align:start position:0%
so could we have an amendment and vote
 
04:45:36.910 --> 04:45:36.920 align:start position:0%
on this next Tuesday certainly
 
04:45:39.868 --> 04:45:39.878 align:start position:0%
okay we will take care of that and
 
04:45:42.628 --> 04:45:42.638 align:start position:0%
unless there is some objection to or
 
04:45:45.670 --> 04:45:45.680 align:start position:0%
other discussion or comments on
 
04:45:48.230 --> 04:45:48.240 align:start position:0%
this no and if it's okay with the with
 
04:45:50.510 --> 04:45:50.520 align:start position:0%
the chair I have to go to o oh I think
 
04:45:51.750 --> 04:45:51.760 align:start position:0%
they're going to still be open I have to
 
04:45:53.708 --> 04:45:53.718 align:start position:0%
go to OLS about something else so I can
 
04:45:56.430 --> 04:45:56.440 align:start position:0%
take this down with me if you'd like
 
04:45:59.868 --> 04:45:59.878 align:start position:0%
you'd like to I'm more than welcome my
 
04:46:03.628 --> 04:46:03.638 align:start position:0%
only my only non- uh comment is I'm not
 
04:46:05.788 --> 04:46:05.798 align:start position:0%
amused by the Senate heing drunk over
 
04:46:08.750 --> 04:46:08.760 align:start position:0%
the wall it I am not amused by Senate
 
04:46:10.990 --> 04:46:11.000 align:start position:0%
the Senate sending us drunk either we
 
04:46:13.350 --> 04:46:13.360 align:start position:0%
will have to deal with it okay so Senate
 
04:46:16.190 --> 04:46:16.200 align:start position:0%
Bill 480 we will we have an amendment
 
04:46:19.190 --> 04:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
pending and we'll vote on it on Tuesday
 
04:46:20.948 --> 04:46:20.958 align:start position:0%
and just to be clear it's an amendment
 
04:46:22.750 --> 04:46:22.760 align:start position:0%
that in that is really relates to
 
04:46:25.590 --> 04:46:25.600 align:start position:0%
section two and three only right with a
 
04:46:30.190 --> 04:46:30.200 align:start position:0%
one change in date okay all right Senate
 
04:46:30.200 --> 04:46:31.990 align:start position:0%
one change in date okay all right Senate
Bill

04:46:31.990 --> 04:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
04:46:34.830 --> 04:46:34.840 align:start position:0%
487 division of
 
04:46:39.628 --> 04:46:39.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:42.110 --> 04:46:42.120 align:start position:0%
motion um move out of pass on Senate
 
04:46:42.120 --> 04:46:43.270 align:start position:0%
motion um move out of pass on Senate
Bill

04:46:43.270 --> 04:46:43.280 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
04:46:49.390 --> 04:46:49.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:53.270 --> 04:46:53.280 align:start position:0%
second wish to speak to it sure I think
 
04:46:56.590 --> 04:46:56.600 align:start position:0%
that for um to address the conflicts
 
04:46:59.470 --> 04:46:59.480 align:start position:0%
between the appeals board sitting inside
 
04:47:02.190 --> 04:47:02.200 align:start position:0%
the um the
 
04:47:05.590 --> 04:47:05.600 align:start position:0%
um uh agency board this bill would
 
04:47:08.350 --> 04:47:08.360 align:start position:0%
address that and it seems to have been
 
04:47:11.510 --> 04:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
um a collaborative effort and I think
 
04:47:14.390 --> 04:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
the um the committee should pass
 
04:47:17.628 --> 04:47:17.638 align:start position:0%
it and um in response to my second I'd
 
04:47:20.628 --> 04:47:20.638 align:start position:0%
like to say that this this
 
04:47:24.470 --> 04:47:24.480 align:start position:0%
uh bill as amended does have very good
 
04:47:27.270 --> 04:47:27.280 align:start position:0%
transition language it says that the
 
04:47:33.070 --> 04:47:33.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:35.990 --> 04:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
um according to the to the current law
 
04:47:38.670 --> 04:47:38.680 align:start position:0%
we don't have to reappoint the whole
 
04:47:42.350 --> 04:47:42.360 align:start position:0%
board and it and uh Das will help them
 
04:47:45.390 --> 04:47:45.400 align:start position:0%
to get their office set up and so forth
 
04:47:48.470 --> 04:47:48.480 align:start position:0%
do we need to address the conflict that
 
04:47:51.190 --> 04:47:51.200 align:start position:0%
representative Brown raised about the
 
04:47:53.708 --> 04:47:53.718 align:start position:0%
number of attorneys on the two lines
 
04:47:56.310 --> 04:47:56.320 align:start position:0%
that's an existing law I personally
 
04:47:58.070 --> 04:47:58.080 align:start position:0%
think they've got three
 
04:47:58.080 --> 04:48:02.150 align:start position:0%
think they've got three
attorneys

04:48:02.150 --> 04:48:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:06.110 --> 04:48:06.120 align:start position:0%
um he he noted at least at least well
 
04:48:08.150 --> 04:48:08.160 align:start position:0%
one me at least one member Labor
 
04:48:10.990 --> 04:48:11.000 align:start position:0%
Relations or Personnel professional at
 
04:48:13.350 --> 04:48:13.360 align:start position:0%
least one shall be employed at public
 
04:48:16.070 --> 04:48:16.080 align:start position:0%
personnel and at least one member is an
 
04:48:18.948 --> 04:48:18.958 align:start position:0%
attorney experienced of the conduct of
 
04:48:20.788 --> 04:48:20.798 align:start position:0%
adjudicative hearings and decision
 
04:48:23.948 --> 04:48:23.958 align:start position:0%
writing and the chair and the vice chair
 
04:48:25.750 --> 04:48:25.760 align:start position:0%
shall be
 
04:48:28.150 --> 04:48:28.160 align:start position:0%
attorneys one of whom could be that
 
04:48:30.948 --> 04:48:30.958 align:start position:0%
other attorney all right
 
04:48:33.830 --> 04:48:33.840 align:start position:0%
but it sounds like there's two attorney
 
04:48:37.548 --> 04:48:37.558 align:start position:0%
at least two attorneys two uh labor
 
04:48:39.868 --> 04:48:39.878 align:start position:0%
people and one person who might be
 
04:48:39.878 --> 04:48:41.910 align:start position:0%
people and one person who might be
either

04:48:41.910 --> 04:48:41.920 align:start position:0%
either
 
04:48:44.070 --> 04:48:44.080 align:start position:0%
I just the gentleman from Personnel just
 
04:48:47.030 --> 04:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
indicated that he would be okay with
 
04:48:49.910 --> 04:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
fixing that agre to make it clearer I
 
04:48:53.390 --> 04:48:53.400 align:start position:0%
just thought I'd raise it okay well I um
 
04:48:55.190 --> 04:48:55.200 align:start position:0%
I think that's current statute and I'm
 
04:48:57.708 --> 04:48:57.718 align:start position:0%
not and I don't know what it should
 
04:49:01.070 --> 04:49:01.080 align:start position:0%
say well that like I said the the
 
04:49:03.110 --> 04:49:03.120 align:start position:0%
testimony from the gentleman from
 
04:49:05.990 --> 04:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
Personnel said that that that was a
 
04:49:08.670 --> 04:49:08.680 align:start position:0%
little conflict that could need fixing
 
04:49:10.788 --> 04:49:10.798 align:start position:0%
so he also said agreed that at Le at
 
04:49:14.430 --> 04:49:14.440 align:start position:0%
least one means could mean two yeah yeah
 
04:49:17.510 --> 04:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
okay R laus yeah just uh do you do you
 
04:49:19.430 --> 04:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
or anyone have any idea why the cost is
 
04:49:23.270 --> 04:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
going from 72 72,000 to 356,000 for
 
04:49:24.830 --> 04:49:24.840 align:start position:0%
running the board I'm just
 
04:49:24.840 --> 04:49:29.110 align:start position:0%
running the board I'm just
curious

04:49:29.110 --> 04:49:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:32.350 --> 04:49:32.360 align:start position:0%
um probably because the effective date
 
04:49:37.750 --> 04:49:37.760 align:start position:0%
is 10 know 60 days after uh passage well
 
04:49:39.030 --> 04:49:39.040 align:start position:0%
it's for each of the following three
 
04:49:42.510 --> 04:49:42.520 align:start position:0%
years oh oh no it's the current budget
 
04:49:46.708 --> 04:49:46.718 align:start position:0%
is 72,000 it goes to 356 right because
 
04:49:48.350 --> 04:49:48.360 align:start position:0%
they are getting a separate Office
 
04:49:50.670 --> 04:49:50.680 align:start position:0%
Independent people they're not stealing
 
04:49:52.990 --> 04:49:53.000 align:start position:0%
people from the division of personnel
 
04:49:54.350 --> 04:49:54.360 align:start position:0%
okay thank
 
04:49:59.070 --> 04:49:59.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:01.590 --> 04:50:01.600 align:start position:0%
staff representative
 
04:50:04.470 --> 04:50:04.480 align:start position:0%
Schmid so I finally gave into the fact
 
04:50:06.868 --> 04:50:06.878 align:start position:0%
that I can't hear worth a lick except
 
04:50:10.110 --> 04:50:10.120 align:start position:0%
when you guys are talking and and uh so
 
04:50:12.628 --> 04:50:12.638 align:start position:0%
I was out of the office out of the
 
04:50:15.070 --> 04:50:15.080 align:start position:0%
committee room when this bill was heard
 
04:50:17.390 --> 04:50:17.400 align:start position:0%
if everybody else is comfortable with
 
04:50:19.868 --> 04:50:19.878 align:start position:0%
this B with this bill I'll stay and vote
 
04:50:22.190 --> 04:50:22.200 align:start position:0%
Yes on it otherwise I don't think I
 
04:50:24.868 --> 04:50:24.878 align:start position:0%
should vote on it but but if everybody
 
04:50:26.830 --> 04:50:26.840 align:start position:0%
else is comfortable with this and think
 
04:50:29.948 --> 04:50:29.958 align:start position:0%
sounds like it's a solid bill I'll stay
 
04:50:31.750 --> 04:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
on vote for
 
04:50:31.760 --> 04:50:33.310 align:start position:0%
on vote for
it

04:50:33.310 --> 04:50:33.320 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:50:36.030 --> 04:50:36.040 align:start position:0%

with we have to change we have to get a
 
04:51:35.670 --> 04:51:35.680 align:start position:0%
new Amendment though we have to get a
 
04:51:40.270 --> 04:51:40.280 align:start position:0%
new Amendment all right so it's a it's a
 
04:51:40.280 --> 04:51:41.030 align:start position:0%
new Amendment all right so it's a it's a
senate

04:51:41.030 --> 04:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
senate
 
04:51:43.708 --> 04:51:43.718 align:start position:0%
Senate Amendment
 
04:51:46.230 --> 04:51:46.240 align:start position:0%

04:51:53.990 --> 04:51:54.000 align:start position:0%

senle 372 to go to to
 
04:52:01.430 --> 04:52:01.440 align:start position:0%
apprentices okay if the plumber
 
04:52:05.510 --> 04:52:05.520 align:start position:0%

will recess the exec on that to in order
 
04:52:11.910 --> 04:52:11.920 align:start position:0%
to get a proper house type Amendment and
 
04:52:14.590 --> 04:52:14.600 align:start position:0%
vote on it on
 
04:52:18.270 --> 04:52:18.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:25.230 --> 04:52:25.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:27.910 --> 04:52:27.920 align:start position:0%
Tuesday it will be in the Legislative
 
04:52:30.030 --> 04:52:30.040 align:start position:0%
Office Building I think it's in this
 
04:52:32.830 --> 04:52:32.840 align:start position:0%
room but I wouldn't swear to it we will
 
04:52:34.868 --> 04:52:34.878 align:start position:0%
uh we can find it that going to be
 
04:52:36.830 --> 04:52:36.840 align:start position:0%
notice with a revised Amendment or do we
 
04:52:39.628 --> 04:52:39.638 align:start position:0%
not or revised notice we don't need that
 
04:52:43.948 --> 04:52:43.958 align:start position:0%
we it will probably be revised but we'll
 
04:52:45.788 --> 04:52:45.798 align:start position:0%
list the the two bills that we need
 
04:52:49.110 --> 04:52:49.120 align:start position:0%
amendments for okay um does any how
 
04:52:50.868 --> 04:52:50.878 align:start position:0%
about Senate Bill
 
04:52:54.990 --> 04:52:55.000 align:start position:0%
600 that's I have serious reservations
 
04:52:58.548 --> 04:52:58.558 align:start position:0%
about that bill okay I think that okay
 
04:53:00.110 --> 04:53:00.120 align:start position:0%
well that was that was the other
 
04:53:03.190 --> 04:53:03.200 align:start position:0%
question I had if it's if there are
 
04:53:05.270 --> 04:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
questions that serious about it we'll
 
04:53:07.990 --> 04:53:08.000 align:start position:0%
send it to subcommittee and let them at
 
04:53:10.948 --> 04:53:10.958 align:start position:0%
least talk through the issues and and we
 
04:53:13.270 --> 04:53:13.280 align:start position:0%
won't schedule this one for an exact on
 
04:53:15.350 --> 04:53:15.360 align:start position:0%
Tuesday I think I think there's a few
 
04:53:17.510 --> 04:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
problems one is the issue of uh
 
04:53:19.670 --> 04:53:19.680 align:start position:0%
certified versus license should it be or
 
04:53:20.990 --> 04:53:21.000 align:start position:0%
I think that's and then the number of
 
04:53:22.230 --> 04:53:22.240 align:start position:0%
years there
 
04:53:24.788 --> 04:53:24.798 align:start position:0%
was people want to change it so that
 
04:53:27.070 --> 04:53:27.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't even sound workable he said it's
 
04:53:32.030 --> 04:53:32.040 align:start position:0%
a a lot of turnover in that field uh and
 
04:53:34.470 --> 04:53:34.480 align:start position:0%
it would be very unlikely you would have
 
04:53:36.670 --> 04:53:36.680 align:start position:0%
a lot of people age we'll have questions
 
04:53:39.910 --> 04:53:39.920 align:start position:0%
in subcommittee Toc I hear you I'm just
 
04:53:42.150 --> 04:53:42.160 align:start position:0%
saying yeah okay it looks like it'll be
 
04:53:44.350 --> 04:53:44.360 align:start position:0%
a lively subcommittee on that and I
 
04:53:46.030 --> 04:53:46.040 align:start position:0%
don't know why the the board of
 
04:53:48.030 --> 04:53:48.040 align:start position:0%
accountancy wants 30 months instead of
 
04:53:50.948 --> 04:53:50.958 align:start position:0%
18 months to finish taking the
 
04:53:54.590 --> 04:53:54.600 align:start position:0%
test since they didn't bother to show
 
04:53:57.708 --> 04:53:57.718 align:start position:0%
up mad CH good luck dealing with that
 
04:54:04.150 --> 04:54:04.160 align:start position:0%
one so recap um 600 Went to went to
 
04:54:06.230 --> 04:54:06.240 align:start position:0%
subcommittee representative Gro is
 
04:54:08.110 --> 04:54:08.120 align:start position:0%
