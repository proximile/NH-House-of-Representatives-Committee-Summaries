session for HB

1316 relative to the co-ownership of

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:30.830 align:start position:0%
dogs and I would like to uh make the
motion

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:30.840 align:start position:0%
motion
 
00:06:34.309 --> 00:06:34.319 align:start position:0%
itl do I hear a
 
00:06:37.029 --> 00:06:37.039 align:start position:0%
second Megan Murray representative
 
00:06:39.469 --> 00:06:39.479 align:start position:0%
Murray good morning
 
00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:43.560 align:start position:0%
um and I will speak to the motion of itl
 
00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
for this bill um we heard testimony
 
00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:51.840 align:start position:0%
about um the co-ownership of dogs and
 
00:06:54.309 --> 00:06:54.319 align:start position:0%
how that relates to
 
00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
contracts and I I understand
 
00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:03.120 align:start position:0%
that the reason why this bill was
 
00:07:05.469 --> 00:07:05.479 align:start position:0%
brought forward was because of an issue
 
00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:07.960 align:start position:0%
in a town
 
00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
where some folks were setting up a uh a
 
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.110 align:start position:0%
where some folks were setting up a uh a
Doggy

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:13.120 align:start position:0%
Doggy
 
00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:18.280 align:start position:0%
Daycare which um they were then under
 
00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:21.440 align:start position:0%
the premise of saying that they would be
 
00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:24.400 align:start position:0%
they they have co-ownership of dogs or
 
00:07:27.629 --> 00:07:27.639 align:start position:0%
that they would be um watching somebody
 
00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
else's animals and I the whole thing in
 
00:07:36.589 --> 00:07:36.599 align:start position:0%
order to change Statute in order to um
 
00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:39.520 align:start position:0%
prevent some kind of fraudulent activity
 
00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:42.280 align:start position:0%
like that it sort of didn't make any
 
00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:45.840 align:start position:0%
kind of um legislative sense as to you
 
00:07:47.589 --> 00:07:47.599 align:start position:0%
know this is seemed to be more of an
 
00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:50.440 align:start position:0%
issue of local enforcement of their
 
00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:52.110 align:start position:0%
issue of local enforcement of their
zoning

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:52.120 align:start position:0%
zoning
 
00:07:55.909 --> 00:07:55.919 align:start position:0%
regulations and so um the thought is
 
00:07:58.270 --> 00:07:58.280 align:start position:0%
that this is not an
 
00:08:01.629 --> 00:08:01.639 align:start position:0%
appropriate uh Bill to to to accomplish
 
00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:06.440 align:start position:0%
that um any other discussion on this
 
00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:08.430 align:start position:0%
that um any other discussion on this
particular

00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:08.440 align:start position:0%
particular
 
00:08:13.029 --> 00:08:13.039 align:start position:0%
bill so I see none and um I would
 
00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:16.440 align:start position:0%
request that the um clerk call the rooll

uh that that that the laws that we have
 
00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:23.120 align:start position:0%

00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:30.200 align:start position:0%
Bixby
 
00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
yeah I I think that um one of the we we
 
00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:37.600 align:start position:0%
did get uh a letter from the um
 
00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:41.200 align:start position:0%
constituent who the uh who who the
 
00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:44.760 align:start position:0%
sponsor had U Been discussing this with
 
00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:48.120 align:start position:0%
about uh sort of discussing a little bit
 
00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:50.720 align:start position:0%
more in depth some of the issues around
 
00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:53.440 align:start position:0%
why it wasn't working and having looked
 
00:10:55.629 --> 00:10:55.639 align:start position:0%
at the looked at that letter and looked
 
00:10:57.750 --> 00:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
at the
 
00:10:59.750 --> 00:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
um looked at the
 
00:11:03.069 --> 00:11:03.079 align:start position:0%
statute uh there there were there a
 
00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:04.920 align:start position:0%
couple of points in the letter one was
 
00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:08.560 align:start position:0%
that the um that the fines were not
 
00:11:11.509 --> 00:11:11.519 align:start position:0%
really the fines were outdated and were
 
00:11:14.509 --> 00:11:14.519 align:start position:0%
not uh enough to actually function as a
 
00:11:17.269 --> 00:11:17.279 align:start position:0%
deterrent that may in fact be the case
 
00:11:19.829 --> 00:11:19.839 align:start position:0%
however when we're talking about uh
 
00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:22.760 align:start position:0%
criminal fines uh that's something that
 
00:11:27.509 --> 00:11:27.519 align:start position:0%
needs to be uh reviewed by I I either
 
00:11:29.269 --> 00:11:29.279 align:start position:0%
it's either criminal justice or J
 
00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:31.680 align:start position:0%
Judiciary I I'm I'm blanking on which
 
00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:33.440 align:start position:0%
one it is but it needs to be reviewed by
 
00:11:36.069 --> 00:11:36.079 align:start position:0%
a second committee and we don't have
 
00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:38.480 align:start position:0%
time to do that review at this point so
 
00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:40.160 align:start position:0%
if there's a question of increasing the
 
00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
fines that's something that should
 
00:11:43.629 --> 00:11:43.639 align:start position:0%
happen with the bill bill we bring
 
00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:49.200 align:start position:0%
forward next year uh in terms of the uh
 
00:11:52.629 --> 00:11:52.639 align:start position:0%
the statute being s unclear I did not
 
00:11:54.389 --> 00:11:54.399 align:start position:0%
see the statute as being unclear it
 
00:11:58.110 --> 00:11:58.120 align:start position:0%
seemed very clear that uh there was a
 
00:11:59.750 --> 00:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
there were different
 
00:12:03.509 --> 00:12:03.519 align:start position:0%
grades of offenses that um uncontrolled
 
00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:07.000 align:start position:0%
dogs could commit and that uh those
 
00:12:08.829 --> 00:12:08.839 align:start position:0%
could there were different ways of
 
00:12:10.269 --> 00:12:10.279 align:start position:0%
handling those
 
00:12:12.829 --> 00:12:12.839 align:start position:0%
including uh bringing the case before a
 
00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
circuit court judge who would then
 
00:12:18.069 --> 00:12:18.079 align:start position:0%
assess the situation with all of the
 
00:12:22.509 --> 00:12:22.519 align:start position:0%
relevant context and I think that uh
 
00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:25.160 align:start position:0%
putting into law doing anything that
 
00:12:28.389 --> 00:12:28.399 align:start position:0%
with this that would uh in in any way
 
00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:29.680 align:start position:0%
get rid of the
 
00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
human discretion the the discretion of a
 
00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:35.320 align:start position:0%
trained judge in this case would be
 
00:12:37.189 --> 00:12:37.199 align:start position:0%
inappropriate because there are so many
 
00:12:39.069 --> 00:12:39.079 align:start position:0%
variables that we talked about in our in
 
00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:42.800 align:start position:0%
our um work session so I think that this
 
00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:45.480 align:start position:0%
this really needs to be itl we may
 
00:12:49.389 --> 00:12:49.399 align:start position:0%
revisit the issue of um of the fines
 
00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:52.120 align:start position:0%
next year but I think that that's not
 
00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:53.880 align:start position:0%
not something for this
 
00:12:57.670 --> 00:12:57.680 align:start position:0%
term any other discussion represent
 
00:13:01.509 --> 00:13:01.519 align:start position:0%
Duty thank you m Madam chair um I agree
 
00:13:04.629 --> 00:13:04.639 align:start position:0%
that maybe this isn't the bill um that
 
00:13:08.829 --> 00:13:08.839 align:start position:0%
uh needs to be passed but um we have
 
00:13:12.069 --> 00:13:12.079 align:start position:0%
seen we have animal cruelty laws on the
 
00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:14.360 align:start position:0%
books we have vicious dog laws on the
 
00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:16.680 align:start position:0%
books and we have seen this over and
 
00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:20.040 align:start position:0%
over and over again in this committee
 
00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:23.360 align:start position:0%
that these laws are not enforced or
 
00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:26.600 align:start position:0%
there's a slap on the wrist okay I mean
 
00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:28.720 align:start position:0%
I can just tell you three points in my
 
00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:31.240 align:start position:0%
life one we had a dog owner in my
 
00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:33.920 align:start position:0%
neighborhood who refused to leash the
 
00:13:35.949 --> 00:13:35.959 align:start position:0%
dog and it would charge people that were
 
00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:38.120 align:start position:0%
running around the you know runners in
 
00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:40.680 align:start position:0%
the neighborhood uh I have an
 
00:13:42.509 --> 00:13:42.519 align:start position:0%
acquaintance whose daughter young
 
00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:45.680 align:start position:0%
daughter was disfigured by uh a vicious
 
00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:49.000 align:start position:0%
dog who bit her ear off and I worked for
 
00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:51.920 align:start position:0%
a gentleman who had two of the breeds
 
00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:55.560 align:start position:0%
that were mentioned in this letter um he
 
00:13:59.670 --> 00:13:59.680 align:start position:0%
had uh his staff over for a meeting
 
00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:01.600 align:start position:0%
and those dogs were locked in another
 
00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:04.600 align:start position:0%
room and for two hours they were clawing
 
00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:07.360 align:start position:0%
at the door and barking and I mean I'll
 
00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
tell you I mean there were like 15
 
00:14:11.749 --> 00:14:11.759 align:start position:0%
adults in the room and all of us were
 
00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:14.680 align:start position:0%
frightened of those dogs so this
 
00:14:16.829 --> 00:14:16.839 align:start position:0%
committee needs to make some
 
00:14:19.189 --> 00:14:19.199 align:start position:0%
recommendation to maybe having a
 
00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:22.600 align:start position:0%
commission or whatever to understand why
 
00:14:25.749 --> 00:14:25.759 align:start position:0%
the laws that are on the books are not
 
00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:28.040 align:start position:0%
being totally
 
00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:31.720 align:start position:0%
enforced representative
 
00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
um sorry representative ktoa thank you
 
00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:35.629 align:start position:0%
um sorry representative ktoa thank you
madam

00:14:35.629 --> 00:14:35.639 align:start position:0%
madam
 
00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:39.240 align:start position:0%
chair um I do somewhat agree with
 
00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:40.430 align:start position:0%
chair um I do somewhat agree with
representative

00:14:40.430 --> 00:14:40.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:14:43.509 --> 00:14:43.519 align:start position:0%
duty but I think there's a disconnect
 
00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:45.720 align:start position:0%
and the disconnect is is in the
 
00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:47.800 align:start position:0%
education of law enforcement in the
 
00:14:50.749 --> 00:14:50.759 align:start position:0%
judicial system and that is currently
 
00:14:53.389 --> 00:14:53.399 align:start position:0%
being worked on uh to educate them
 
00:14:56.110 --> 00:14:56.120 align:start position:0%
better to possibly have training classes
 
00:14:58.389 --> 00:14:58.399 align:start position:0%
at the police academy so that they can
 
00:14:58.399 --> 00:14:59.870 align:start position:0%
at the police academy so that they can
understand

00:14:59.870 --> 00:14:59.880 align:start position:0%
understand
 
00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:02.360 align:start position:0%
uh the the animal cruelty law so that
 
00:15:05.949 --> 00:15:05.959 align:start position:0%
they can be enforced better so um that
 
00:15:08.749 --> 00:15:08.759 align:start position:0%
is that is really where the disconnect
 
00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
is and I do believe that there are
 
00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:13.160 align:start position:0%
efforts underway to improve
 
00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:20.829 --> 00:15:20.839 align:start position:0%
discussion okay seeing none I'll ask the

the motion of itl please okay uh do I
 
00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:45.120 align:start position:0%

Katon seconds would you like to speak to
 
00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:49.480 align:start position:0%
your motion representative Murray uh
 
00:16:51.269 --> 00:16:51.279 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair yes I think we
 
00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:54.680 align:start position:0%
have looked at this um be um this issue
 
00:16:57.949 --> 00:16:57.959 align:start position:0%
currently and um we had a very lengthy
 
00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
discussion about the potential of
 
00:17:04.110 --> 00:17:04.120 align:start position:0%
removing this um and um Not only would
 
00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:06.760 align:start position:0%
it create problems for local
 
00:17:08.590 --> 00:17:08.600 align:start position:0%
municipalities but it would also then
 
00:17:12.069 --> 00:17:12.079 align:start position:0%
put community at risk to not have uh an
 
00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:14.760 align:start position:0%
annual registration we also talked about
 
00:17:17.669 --> 00:17:17.679 align:start position:0%
the potentiality which we have looked at
 
00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:20.160 align:start position:0%
in previous years of biannual
 
00:17:21.829 --> 00:17:21.839 align:start position:0%
registration or excuse me every other
 
00:17:24.789 --> 00:17:24.799 align:start position:0%
year registration um and that would be a
 
00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:27.240 align:start position:0%
very difficult thing for Town clerks as
 
00:17:30.029 --> 00:17:30.039 align:start position:0%
they had mentioned to um be able to test
 
00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:32.760 align:start position:0%
you know to look through and see who was
 
00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:35.160 align:start position:0%
up for that registration at which time
 
00:17:38.549 --> 00:17:38.559 align:start position:0%
the annual um dog uh registration of $7
 
00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:40.960 align:start position:0%
right now also that money goes to local
 
00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
programs as well for other things
 
00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
outside of um that that go um towards
 
00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:49.120 align:start position:0%
animal welfare and um Healthy
 
00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:51.160 align:start position:0%
Communities for um those who are in the
 
00:17:54.190 --> 00:17:54.200 align:start position:0%
pet community so I that's why I think
 
00:17:55.870 --> 00:17:55.880 align:start position:0%
that we should just leave it the way it
 
00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:00.840 align:start position:0%
is any other comments on this
 
00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:02.720 align:start position:0%
I mean I would I would just want to
 
00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:05.480 align:start position:0%
comment about um how important it is for
 
00:18:09.870 --> 00:18:09.880 align:start position:0%
people to um to register their dogs
 
00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:12.080 align:start position:0%
annually it's not a whole lot of money
 
00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:14.360 align:start position:0%
$7 and if you're a senior citizen I
 
00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
think it's
 
00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:19.280 align:start position:0%
two um and and the fact that
 
00:18:22.789 --> 00:18:22.799 align:start position:0%
registration is coupled with the uh
 
00:18:24.990 --> 00:18:25.000 align:start position:0%
rabies vaccination that's the most
 
00:18:27.789 --> 00:18:27.799 align:start position:0%
important thing is to make sure that our
 
00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
dogs are
 
00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:33.760 align:start position:0%
um are vaccinated um to protect not only
 
00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:37.960 align:start position:0%
them but also uh the human population
 
00:18:40.149 --> 00:18:40.159 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:44.000 align:start position:0%
um the the the law the way it works now
 
00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:48.320 align:start position:0%
um works well and um I I don't see any
 
00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
any reason to um to make any changes to
 
00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:54.280 align:start position:0%
it or repeal it obviously so I will
 
00:18:57.470 --> 00:18:57.480 align:start position:0%
support the itl any other
 
00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:00.480 align:start position:0%
comments see being none I would request
 
00:19:02.549 --> 00:19:02.559 align:start position:0%

00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:27.280 align:start position:0%
this was around six years ago um
 
00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:30.320 align:start position:0%
about the exemptions for the rabies
 
00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:34.640 align:start position:0%
vaccine this program of vaccinating all
 
00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:38.840 align:start position:0%
dogs the part that I have that's um that
 
00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:41.120 align:start position:0%
I still had six years ago is that all
 
00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:46.720 align:start position:0%
animals receed the same dosage um and so
 
00:20:48.510 --> 00:20:48.520 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of research but the
 
00:20:51.789 --> 00:20:51.799 align:start position:0%
research is not complete yet so this
 
00:20:54.549 --> 00:20:54.559 align:start position:0%
program works remarkably well we don't
 
00:20:58.350 --> 00:20:58.360 align:start position:0%
have any problems and so it should stay
 
00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:00.400 align:start position:0%
the the way it
 
00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
is any other questions or comments
 
00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
regarding this I I do want to um make a
 
00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:11.440 align:start position:0%
comment regarding and I did share the
 
00:21:15.909 --> 00:21:15.919 align:start position:0%
the letter that I had sent to Dr
 
00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:20.320 align:start position:0%
craford asking him um you know is there
 
00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:21.110 align:start position:0%
craford asking him um you know is there
a

00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:24.400 align:start position:0%
way uh and should we or could we lift
 
00:21:26.830 --> 00:21:26.840 align:start position:0%
the protocols for say dogs that are
 
00:21:29.909 --> 00:21:29.919 align:start position:0%
older that are ill that are sick that
 
00:21:32.149 --> 00:21:32.159 align:start position:0%
maybe the owners have trouble getting
 
00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:34.400 align:start position:0%
muzzles on them putting when they're
 
00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
when they have to go
 
00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:37.310 align:start position:0%
when they have to go
outside

00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:37.320 align:start position:0%
outside
 
00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
um and you know I'm sensitive to the
 
00:21:45.750 --> 00:21:45.760 align:start position:0%
issue that uh representative ammon's
 
00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
constituent had brought to us you know
 
00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:51.440 align:start position:0%
about her her old sick
 
00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
animal and uh having to deal with uh
 
00:21:58.070 --> 00:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
some of the rabies protocols and his
 
00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:00.600 align:start position:0%
response was that local rabies control
 
00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
authorities already have the latitude to
 
00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:06.200 align:start position:0%
establish local standards and in
 
00:22:09.029 --> 00:22:09.039 align:start position:0%
addition when the animal is
 
00:22:11.669 --> 00:22:11.679 align:start position:0%
outdoors it shall be muzzled in a manner
 
00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:13.840 align:start position:0%
approved by local rabies control
 
00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:17.360 align:start position:0%
Authority so you know I think there
 
00:22:21.909 --> 00:22:21.919 align:start position:0%
there is some latitude in the law that I
 
00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:23.960 align:start position:0%
guess if the if the constituent would
 
00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
talk to um you know the local animal
 
00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:29.840 align:start position:0%
control person
 
00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:32.480 align:start position:0%
that there may be you know a remedy for
 
00:22:37.029 --> 00:22:37.039 align:start position:0%
her um but in general um he we're
 
00:22:39.669 --> 00:22:39.679 align:start position:0%
hesitant to make any kind of changes for
 
00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:41.880 align:start position:0%
protocol especially for dogs that would
 
00:22:44.510 --> 00:22:44.520 align:start position:0%
be put outside in their backyard that's
 
00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:46.960 align:start position:0%
fence because we know animals can get
 
00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
loose they can jump the fence they can
 
00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:53.400 align:start position:0%
find a way out and that might um pose a
 
00:22:55.470 --> 00:22:55.480 align:start position:0%
high risk or you know at least another
 
00:22:59.149 --> 00:22:59.159 align:start position:0%
risk for um exposure to rap
 
00:23:01.789 --> 00:23:01.799 align:start position:0%
or not only for the animal but you know
 
00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
the animal could get in contact with a
 
00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:05.480 align:start position:0%
rapid raccoon or
 
00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:09.080 align:start position:0%
something so I think that um you know
 
00:23:12.190 --> 00:23:12.200 align:start position:0%
any any any of these bills that come
 
00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
before us seeking um exemptions or
 
00:23:20.590 --> 00:23:20.600 align:start position:0%
changes in the protocol um we have to be
 
00:23:23.230 --> 00:23:23.240 align:start position:0%
very sensitive and and um you know look
 
00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
at what what different
 
00:23:29.029 --> 00:23:29.039 align:start position:0%
ramifications could occur because it
 
00:23:29.039 --> 00:23:30.590 align:start position:0%
ramifications could occur because it
representative

00:23:30.590 --> 00:23:30.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:23:34.750 --> 00:23:34.760 align:start position:0%
Bixby yeah so uh one um point that is
 
00:23:37.390 --> 00:23:37.400 align:start position:0%
sometimes brought up by people who think
 
00:23:40.549 --> 00:23:40.559 align:start position:0%
that uh rabies control restrictions
 
00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
should be
 
00:23:46.029 --> 00:23:46.039 align:start position:0%
reduced is that there is rabies already
 
00:23:48.909 --> 00:23:48.919 align:start position:0%
in the endemic in the the wildlife of
 
00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:51.760 align:start position:0%
the state and that we haven't had a
 
00:23:54.510 --> 00:23:54.520 align:start position:0%
problem with it uh the reason we haven't
 
00:23:56.430 --> 00:23:56.440 align:start position:0%
had a problem with it is because we do
 
00:24:00.510 --> 00:24:00.520 align:start position:0%
have a strict ra rabies vaccination uh
 
00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:05.200 align:start position:0%
program and uh it is you know bats can
 
00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
carry it a bat can get into your house
 
00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:09.360 align:start position:0%
and expose your dog without your knowing
 
00:24:14.029 --> 00:24:14.039 align:start position:0%
it uh dogs are curious they could get
 
00:24:16.990 --> 00:24:17.000 align:start position:0%
into you know if there's a dead raccoon
 
00:24:19.029 --> 00:24:19.039 align:start position:0%
because it's died of rapies and they
 
00:24:21.789 --> 00:24:21.799 align:start position:0%
sort of start nuzzling that they can be
 
00:24:24.549 --> 00:24:24.559 align:start position:0%
get get exposed there are many channels
 
00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
of potential channels of exposure where
 
00:24:29.470 --> 00:24:29.480 align:start position:0%
the owner would not not know that the
 
00:24:31.789 --> 00:24:31.799 align:start position:0%
that the animal that their dog their pet
 
00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:35.200 align:start position:0%
was getting exposed and we need to have
 
00:24:39.310 --> 00:24:39.320 align:start position:0%
a strict as possible a rabies
 
00:24:41.389 --> 00:24:41.399 align:start position:0%
vaccination program and if there are
 
00:24:44.350 --> 00:24:44.360 align:start position:0%
exemptions granted for specific reasons
 
00:24:46.510 --> 00:24:46.520 align:start position:0%
those dogs need to be overseen
 
00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:48.470 align:start position:0%
those dogs need to be overseen
particularly

00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:48.480 align:start position:0%
particularly
 
00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:52.320 align:start position:0%
closely any other comments represent
 
00:24:54.710 --> 00:24:54.720 align:start position:0%
Penza i' just like to Second a little
 
00:24:59.510 --> 00:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
bit of what you said um um chairwoman
 
00:25:01.789 --> 00:25:01.799 align:start position:0%
talking with someone that um had
 
00:25:04.029 --> 00:25:04.039 align:start position:0%
concerns about this bill just because of
 
00:25:05.870 --> 00:25:05.880 align:start position:0%
the same thing an older dog and all of
 
00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:08.240 align:start position:0%
that I think that the we always want to
 
00:25:10.950 --> 00:25:10.960 align:start position:0%
Champion local control and I think that
 
00:25:13.870 --> 00:25:13.880 align:start position:0%
many of these folks that work in um
 
00:25:15.710 --> 00:25:15.720 align:start position:0%
whether the department in animal control
 
00:25:17.549 --> 00:25:17.559 align:start position:0%
they totally have a heart and if that
 
00:25:19.750 --> 00:25:19.760 align:start position:0%
dog doesn't have the you know skill set
 
00:25:21.549 --> 00:25:21.559 align:start position:0%
anymore to be jumping fences and all
 
00:25:24.190 --> 00:25:24.200 align:start position:0%
that kind of stuff I think that uh I
 
00:25:25.909 --> 00:25:25.919 align:start position:0%
think this that can totally be handled
 
00:25:28.269 --> 00:25:28.279 align:start position:0%
on a local level where you know
 
00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:30.360 align:start position:0%
exeptions can be made because you know
 
00:25:33.149 --> 00:25:33.159 align:start position:0%
that dog is uh you know is doesn't have
 
00:25:34.990 --> 00:25:35.000 align:start position:0%
the verocity anymore to be able to do
 
00:25:36.750 --> 00:25:36.760 align:start position:0%
those things so I appreciate what you
 
00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:38.840 align:start position:0%
said but I I think that we need to keep
 
00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:40.720 align:start position:0%
this in place as well and I think this
 
00:25:42.630 --> 00:25:42.640 align:start position:0%
can be handled just based upon a
 
00:25:44.149 --> 00:25:44.159 align:start position:0%
community and having a heart for those
 
00:25:44.159 --> 00:25:46.549 align:start position:0%
community and having a heart for those
situations

00:25:46.549 --> 00:25:46.559 align:start position:0%
situations
 
00:25:49.630 --> 00:25:49.640 align:start position:0%
specifically thank you any other uh
 
00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
questions or comments having to do with
 
00:25:53.789 --> 00:25:53.799 align:start position:0%

1556 and I will now open up the exec
 
00:26:54.990 --> 00:26:55.000 align:start position:0%
session for HB
 
00:26:57.590 --> 00:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
1102 relative to the definition of
 
00:27:00.389 --> 00:27:00.399 align:start position:0%
animal cruel crty do I hear a
 
00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
motion represent Bixby I move
 
00:27:07.669 --> 00:27:07.679 align:start position:0%
itl um I will second that and
 
00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:09.760 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby would you please
 
00:27:14.669 --> 00:27:14.679 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion so um we heard a
 
00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:18.720 align:start position:0%
lot of testimony a lot of evidence and
 
00:27:22.870 --> 00:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
uh what that what that testimony uh
 
00:27:25.789 --> 00:27:25.799 align:start position:0%
seemed to indicate was there is a
 
00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
problem and uh that the problem that um
 
00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:36.480 align:start position:0%
that is a it's a problem where um if
 
00:27:39.149 --> 00:27:39.159 align:start position:0%
breeders are not careful about what they
 
00:27:41.310 --> 00:27:41.320 align:start position:0%
you know their their procedures they can
 
00:27:43.190 --> 00:27:43.200 align:start position:0%
end up breeding dogs that are
 
00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:48.480 align:start position:0%
congenitally going to suffer and uh the
 
00:27:52.230 --> 00:27:52.240 align:start position:0%
but um the question becomes how do we
 
00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:55.360 align:start position:0%
deal with that and uh is there a
 
00:27:56.870 --> 00:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
solution that the New Hampshire
 
00:27:58.710 --> 00:27:58.720 align:start position:0%
legislature can come up with with that
 
00:28:01.310 --> 00:28:01.320 align:start position:0%
will deal with that effectively uh the
 
00:28:04.389 --> 00:28:04.399 align:start position:0%
the solution in the original bill would
 
00:28:07.669 --> 00:28:07.679 align:start position:0%
have created a new part of the criminal
 
00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:09.760 align:start position:0%
code that would have
 
00:28:11.470 --> 00:28:11.480 align:start position:0%
criminalized uh
 
00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:15.000 align:start position:0%
breeding uh animals and that had some
 
00:28:19.029 --> 00:28:19.039 align:start position:0%
sort of a painful deformity uh and uh
 
00:28:23.350 --> 00:28:23.360 align:start position:0%
were selling them and uh there are two
 
00:28:25.230 --> 00:28:25.240 align:start position:0%
there were two problems with that one is
 
00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
that putting it into the criminal code
 
00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:28.840 align:start position:0%
where it was
 
00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:32.640 align:start position:0%
uh the other is uh what the mechanism of
 
00:28:36.269 --> 00:28:36.279 align:start position:0%
enforcement would be uh we had testimony
 
00:28:38.830 --> 00:28:38.840 align:start position:0%
uh from someone who has done animal
 
00:28:41.070 --> 00:28:41.080 align:start position:0%
cruelty uh
 
00:28:43.389 --> 00:28:43.399 align:start position:0%
investigations uh which are fairly
 
00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
complicated Affairs she described the
 
00:28:49.549 --> 00:28:49.559 align:start position:0%
processes that would be necessary and uh
 
00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
when she was asked if it would be
 
00:28:55.149 --> 00:28:55.159 align:start position:0%
possible to successfully do an
 
00:28:57.029 --> 00:28:57.039 align:start position:0%
investigation and
 
00:28:57.039 --> 00:28:58.549 align:start position:0%
investigation and
prosecute

00:28:58.549 --> 00:28:58.559 align:start position:0%
prosecute
 
00:29:00.430 --> 00:29:00.440 align:start position:0%
uh this as it was laid out in the
 
00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:04.240 align:start position:0%
original bill it would not be possible
 
00:29:09.430 --> 00:29:09.440 align:start position:0%
um the uh so uh the other issue with it
 
00:29:12.509 --> 00:29:12.519 align:start position:0%
with that with the original bill was the
 
00:29:14.789 --> 00:29:14.799 align:start position:0%
uh lack of clarity in the definition of
 
00:29:18.070 --> 00:29:18.080 align:start position:0%
what the problem was and so the original
 
00:29:20.389 --> 00:29:20.399 align:start position:0%
bill was not
 
00:29:24.149 --> 00:29:24.159 align:start position:0%
um just did not have what it took to be
 
00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:26.960 align:start position:0%
good legislation or to become good law
 
00:29:29.310 --> 00:29:29.320 align:start position:0%
uh there has I have seen a um an
 
00:29:31.909 --> 00:29:31.919 align:start position:0%
amendment proposed and the amendment
 
00:29:34.430 --> 00:29:34.440 align:start position:0%
gets rid of some of the worst problems
 
00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:36.880 align:start position:0%
of the original Bill uh it does not make
 
00:29:38.830 --> 00:29:38.840 align:start position:0%
it a criminal act it makes it a
 
00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
violation but in terms of the how that
 
00:29:45.990 --> 00:29:46.000 align:start position:0%
would get uh enforced it's even it's
 
00:29:47.630 --> 00:29:47.640 align:start position:0%
it's even harder to see how that would
 
00:29:50.750 --> 00:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
be enforced and in terms of the
 
00:29:52.509 --> 00:29:52.519 align:start position:0%
definition of the problem it would
 
00:29:55.630 --> 00:29:55.640 align:start position:0%
basically just criminalize three breeds
 
00:29:57.029 --> 00:29:57.039 align:start position:0%
and I don't think we should be
 
00:30:00.750 --> 00:30:00.760 align:start position:0%
criminalizing breeds of dogs uh I don't
 
00:30:04.389 --> 00:30:04.399 align:start position:0%
think that this is a problem that can be
 
00:30:06.750 --> 00:30:06.760 align:start position:0%
uh handled by a single state there may
 
00:30:10.750 --> 00:30:10.760 align:start position:0%
be some way of uh in the future of
 
00:30:14.909 --> 00:30:14.919 align:start position:0%
requiring that dogs with genetic markers
 
00:30:18.830 --> 00:30:18.840 align:start position:0%
uh are uh dogs that that might be prone
 
00:30:21.310 --> 00:30:21.320 align:start position:0%
to this are tested for genetic markers
 
00:30:23.549 --> 00:30:23.559 align:start position:0%
and those dogs with those genetic
 
00:30:26.389 --> 00:30:26.399 align:start position:0%
markers might be somehow prevented from
 
00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
being bred uh doing that on a state
 
00:30:31.389 --> 00:30:31.399 align:start position:0%
level would
 
00:30:35.630 --> 00:30:35.640 align:start position:0%
be pretty much impossible so uh I don't
 
00:30:38.029 --> 00:30:38.039 align:start position:0%
think that there is something for us to
 
00:30:41.669 --> 00:30:41.679 align:start position:0%
study here uh so I I think that uh this
 
00:30:46.430 --> 00:30:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:49.549 --> 00:30:49.559 align:start position:0%
itl any other discussion representative
 
00:30:52.830 --> 00:30:52.840 align:start position:0%
Duty uh thank you madam chair I agree
 
00:30:55.230 --> 00:30:55.240 align:start position:0%
with most of what representative Bixby
 
00:30:58.430 --> 00:30:58.440 align:start position:0%
has said uh except for the last part
 
00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:01.440 align:start position:0%
uh regarding um studying the issue
 
00:31:04.830 --> 00:31:04.840 align:start position:0%
further uh I think we have uh a good
 
00:31:07.870 --> 00:31:07.880 align:start position:0%
amendment that has come forward that has
 
00:31:10.470 --> 00:31:10.480 align:start position:0%
drastically reduced the scope of the
 
00:31:13.629 --> 00:31:13.639 align:start position:0%
original bill um and I think this is
 
00:31:16.110 --> 00:31:16.120 align:start position:0%
definitely something that we should need
 
00:31:19.310 --> 00:31:19.320 align:start position:0%
to study further es especially if we
 
00:31:21.710 --> 00:31:21.720 align:start position:0%
have breeders who
 
00:31:24.909 --> 00:31:24.919 align:start position:0%
consistently uh push the boundaries uh
 
00:31:29.870 --> 00:31:29.880 align:start position:0%
in order to um have animals um that can
 
00:31:33.870 --> 00:31:33.880 align:start position:0%
uh better compete uh in um uh some of
 
00:31:37.149 --> 00:31:37.159 align:start position:0%
the dog shows um that are around the
 
00:31:41.789 --> 00:31:41.799 align:start position:0%
country and I think in our state so um I
 
00:31:44.990 --> 00:31:45.000 align:start position:0%
will not be supporting itl uh I would
 
00:31:48.509 --> 00:31:48.519 align:start position:0%
like to see a motion of interim study um
 
00:31:51.870 --> 00:31:51.880 align:start position:0%
so that we can reduce those breeders uh
 
00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
who may have more of a financial
 
00:31:56.310 --> 00:31:56.320 align:start position:0%
incentive to breed these dogs that
 
00:31:58.990 --> 00:31:59.000 align:start position:0%
suffer um rather than the compassion
 
00:32:01.110 --> 00:32:01.120 align:start position:0%
that we know most of the Breeders have
 
00:32:04.669 --> 00:32:04.679 align:start position:0%
for the breeds that they breed thank you
 
00:32:06.629 --> 00:32:06.639 align:start position:0%
representative H Haskins thank you madam
 
00:32:08.509 --> 00:32:08.519 align:start position:0%
chair I'm going to agree with
 
00:32:11.470 --> 00:32:11.480 align:start position:0%
representative Duty I I think the
 
00:32:14.750 --> 00:32:14.760 align:start position:0%
testimony was just too compelling to me
 
00:32:16.870 --> 00:32:16.880 align:start position:0%
to itl this bill I think there are
 
00:32:19.830 --> 00:32:19.840 align:start position:0%
things that we could do to advance those
 
00:32:23.190 --> 00:32:23.200 align:start position:0%
arguments further and I agree with
 
00:32:25.789 --> 00:32:25.799 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby that it it may need
 
00:32:28.789 --> 00:32:28.799 align:start position:0%
Federal action but we can't
 
00:32:31.029 --> 00:32:31.039 align:start position:0%
affect that at the moment but what we
 
00:32:33.950 --> 00:32:33.960 align:start position:0%
can affect is what we do here in New
 
00:32:37.389 --> 00:32:37.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so I will vote against the itl
 
00:32:39.350 --> 00:32:39.360 align:start position:0%
in favor of intern study representative
 
00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
Murray thank you madam chair um I one of
 
00:32:43.909 --> 00:32:43.919 align:start position:0%
the I I thought that the bill
 
00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
highlighted a lot of very important
 
00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:47.840 align:start position:0%
considerations I learned a lot like you
 
00:32:49.990 --> 00:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
had mentioned um one of the things that
 
00:32:53.669 --> 00:32:53.679 align:start position:0%
I do think was compelling for me to hear
 
00:32:56.870 --> 00:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
in support of the itl was um testimony
 
00:33:00.750 --> 00:33:00.760 align:start position:0%
around the AMA VMA the American
 
00:33:03.750 --> 00:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
Veterinary Medical Association um and
 
00:33:07.389 --> 00:33:07.399 align:start position:0%
creating na a national position on um
 
00:33:10.190 --> 00:33:10.200 align:start position:0%
direction to um potentially breeders
 
00:33:12.110 --> 00:33:12.120 align:start position:0%
breed clubs organizations on the
 
00:33:15.029 --> 00:33:15.039 align:start position:0%
direction that they felt needed to go
 
00:33:19.070 --> 00:33:19.080 align:start position:0%
for a multitude of of congenital or or
 
00:33:23.070 --> 00:33:23.080 align:start position:0%
bred for conditions um that were either
 
00:33:25.950 --> 00:33:25.960 align:start position:0%
um desired traits or otherwise and I
 
00:33:29.310 --> 00:33:29.320 align:start position:0%
think that um to what representative
 
00:33:32.110 --> 00:33:32.120 align:start position:0%
Bixby spoke to uh we heard hours and
 
00:33:36.909 --> 00:33:36.919 align:start position:0%
hours and hours worth of testimony and
 
00:33:40.110 --> 00:33:40.120 align:start position:0%
um I would like to see there being a
 
00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:42.110 align:start position:0%
um I would like to see there being a
more

00:33:42.110 --> 00:33:42.120 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:33:45.310 --> 00:33:45.320 align:start position:0%
um a a larger National sort of response
 
00:33:47.389 --> 00:33:47.399 align:start position:0%
to this because this isn't just one area
 
00:33:50.070 --> 00:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
we see um animals coming from all across
 
00:33:51.950 --> 00:33:51.960 align:start position:0%
the country in some circumstances this
 
00:33:55.590 --> 00:33:55.600 align:start position:0%
is just not also just a New Hampshire
 
00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:56.710 align:start position:0%
is just not also just a New Hampshire
breed

00:33:56.710 --> 00:33:56.720 align:start position:0%
breed
 
00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:58.350 align:start position:0%
breed
issue

00:33:58.350 --> 00:33:58.360 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:34:01.070 --> 00:34:01.080 align:start position:0%
thank you um representative ger and then
 
00:34:03.430 --> 00:34:03.440 align:start position:0%
representative kraton thank you madam
 
00:34:05.230 --> 00:34:05.240 align:start position:0%
chair so I I was
 
00:34:08.990 --> 00:34:09.000 align:start position:0%
definitely inclined to support itl uh
 
00:34:10.990 --> 00:34:11.000 align:start position:0%
until having looked at the proposed
 
00:34:14.430 --> 00:34:14.440 align:start position:0%
amendment I think offers some good uh
 
00:34:17.629 --> 00:34:17.639 align:start position:0%
tightening of the original Bill uh and
 
00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:19.200 align:start position:0%
addresses some of the concerns that I
 
00:34:23.270 --> 00:34:23.280 align:start position:0%
really had and I am in the end you're
 
00:34:24.629 --> 00:34:24.639 align:start position:0%
really concerned from some of the
 
00:34:25.869 --> 00:34:25.879 align:start position:0%
testimony we heard we're talking about
 
00:34:28.109 --> 00:34:28.119 align:start position:0%
the four most popular breeds of dog dogs
 
00:34:31.190 --> 00:34:31.200 align:start position:0%
here and where there is that type of
 
00:34:35.230 --> 00:34:35.240 align:start position:0%
demand for these breeds precisely
 
00:34:38.470 --> 00:34:38.480 align:start position:0%
because of the aesthetic what I am
 
00:34:40.710 --> 00:34:40.720 align:start position:0%
really concerned is you know we talk
 
00:34:43.270 --> 00:34:43.280 align:start position:0%
about um
 
00:34:45.270 --> 00:34:45.280 align:start position:0%
scrupulous breeders or we talk about
 
00:34:46.669 --> 00:34:46.679 align:start position:0%
people who are doing it the right way
 
00:34:50.230 --> 00:34:50.240 align:start position:0%
right uh and and God bless them and we
 
00:34:51.589 --> 00:34:51.599 align:start position:0%
understand that they're doing them doing
 
00:34:53.149 --> 00:34:53.159 align:start position:0%
it the right way but when there is such
 
00:34:55.710 --> 00:34:55.720 align:start position:0%
an economic incentive for people to
 
00:34:59.030 --> 00:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
breed these dogs with extreme features
 
00:35:00.950 --> 00:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
um that is a concern for me that's a
 
00:35:03.069 --> 00:35:03.079 align:start position:0%
powerful economic incentive and I was
 
00:35:06.630 --> 00:35:06.640 align:start position:0%
really also um compelled by the
 
00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
testimony we had from the vet who came
 
00:35:09.710 --> 00:35:09.720 align:start position:0%
out I think it was from Rhode Island
 
00:35:11.230 --> 00:35:11.240 align:start position:0%
right or Massachusetts he was not a
 
00:35:14.190 --> 00:35:14.200 align:start position:0%
state vet uh but also from discussions
 
00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
with uh my vet in Kean when I talked
 
00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:18.720 align:start position:0%
about this she had some concerns that I
 
00:35:20.670 --> 00:35:20.680 align:start position:0%
think the amendment addresses she
 
00:35:22.750 --> 00:35:22.760 align:start position:0%
supported the idea behind it but was
 
00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:24.720 align:start position:0%
concerned about some of the things that
 
00:35:26.910 --> 00:35:26.920 align:start position:0%
as I said I think the amendment gets to
 
00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
well so uh I also think that there is a
 
00:35:33.069 --> 00:35:33.079 align:start position:0%
good reason to continue to study this
 
00:35:36.069 --> 00:35:36.079 align:start position:0%
and to see if there is a way forward so
 
00:35:38.990 --> 00:35:39.000 align:start position:0%
I would prefer interim study to itl
 
00:35:40.630 --> 00:35:40.640 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:35:44.870 --> 00:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
kraton thank you madam chair yeah my um
 
00:35:47.430 --> 00:35:47.440 align:start position:0%
my personal vet who happens to me my
 
00:35:50.190 --> 00:35:50.200 align:start position:0%
daughter explained that when she does
 
00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:52.240 align:start position:0%
these surgeries they're they're pretty
 
00:35:56.390 --> 00:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
horrific and and that she is uh
 
00:35:58.309 --> 00:35:58.319 align:start position:0%
definitely opposed to the breeding of
 
00:36:02.670 --> 00:36:02.680 align:start position:0%
dogs that that are tend to have these uh
 
00:36:05.109 --> 00:36:05.119 align:start position:0%
conditions um but as we as we talked
 
00:36:08.589 --> 00:36:08.599 align:start position:0%
about it and went through it uh a couple
 
00:36:10.550 --> 00:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
of things occurred to me first of all
 
00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:13.200 align:start position:0%
this build then would prohibit the sell
 
00:36:14.589 --> 00:36:14.599 align:start position:0%
of these dogs
 
00:36:17.510 --> 00:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
from um shelters and that type of thing
 
00:36:19.630 --> 00:36:19.640 align:start position:0%
which then leads me to wonder what you
 
00:36:23.150 --> 00:36:23.160 align:start position:0%
do with the dogs that are already in the
 
00:36:27.270 --> 00:36:27.280 align:start position:0%
system uh and then um this the second
 
00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:28.069 align:start position:0%
system uh and then um this the second
thing

00:36:28.069 --> 00:36:28.079 align:start position:0%
thing
 
00:36:30.510 --> 00:36:30.520 align:start position:0%
was that
 
00:36:35.270 --> 00:36:35.280 align:start position:0%
uh I'm just not sure that the Breeders I
 
00:36:38.150 --> 00:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
I let me rephrase it I I'm convinced
 
00:36:41.790 --> 00:36:41.800 align:start position:0%
that the Breeders and then AKC and other
 
00:36:44.950 --> 00:36:44.960 align:start position:0%
organizations are uh much more attuned
 
00:36:48.230 --> 00:36:48.240 align:start position:0%
to this just based on the volume of of
 
00:36:50.109 --> 00:36:50.119 align:start position:0%
emails and volume of attention that we
 
00:36:52.309 --> 00:36:52.319 align:start position:0%
got on this and so I think we have
 
00:36:54.589 --> 00:36:54.599 align:start position:0%
pushed the ball pretty far forward into
 
00:36:56.309 --> 00:36:56.319 align:start position:0%
their court and they've signed up to do
 
00:36:58.510 --> 00:36:58.520 align:start position:0%
it and I think think that's where we
 
00:37:00.150 --> 00:37:00.160 align:start position:0%
that's where we should leave it is is in
 
00:37:04.150 --> 00:37:04.160 align:start position:0%
their hands over okay any other comment
 
00:37:06.190 --> 00:37:06.200 align:start position:0%
representative sopak
 
00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:08.589 align:start position:0%
representative sopak
kittis

00:37:08.589 --> 00:37:08.599 align:start position:0%
kittis
 
00:37:12.750 --> 00:37:12.760 align:start position:0%
um I also would support interim study
 
00:37:15.630 --> 00:37:15.640 align:start position:0%
mom when you're a saying that you would
 
00:37:18.589 --> 00:37:18.599 align:start position:0%
like a federal response to this I think
 
00:37:21.710 --> 00:37:21.720 align:start position:0%
there's um a way for New Hampshire to be
 
00:37:26.309 --> 00:37:26.319 align:start position:0%
a a trend Setter to give direction and
 
00:37:28.870 --> 00:37:28.880 align:start position:0%
um feedback to our
 
00:37:31.710 --> 00:37:31.720 align:start position:0%
delegation so that they could start to
 
00:37:33.790 --> 00:37:33.800 align:start position:0%
do this I know that representative
 
00:37:37.030 --> 00:37:37.040 align:start position:0%
kuster has um done a lot of work on the
 
00:37:39.390 --> 00:37:39.400 align:start position:0%
agriculture committee down there and I
 
00:37:40.910 --> 00:37:40.920 align:start position:0%
just think that we could take a
 
00:37:44.990 --> 00:37:45.000 align:start position:0%
leadership role in this um even my dogs
 
00:37:47.589 --> 00:37:47.599 align:start position:0%
Newland dogs are
 
00:37:52.430 --> 00:37:52.440 align:start position:0%
um because of the ratio of what they say
 
00:37:56.109 --> 00:37:56.119 align:start position:0%
these Breaky stalic dogs are if you if
 
00:37:58.990 --> 00:37:59.000 align:start position:0%
you extrapolated out New Finland dogs St
 
00:38:01.829 --> 00:38:01.839 align:start position:0%
Bernard dogs those dogs that drool a lot
 
00:38:04.990 --> 00:38:05.000 align:start position:0%
those are also um these Breaky spyic
 
00:38:10.829 --> 00:38:10.839 align:start position:0%
dogs um and so I think that if we make a
 
00:38:14.710 --> 00:38:14.720 align:start position:0%
model um getting we can get together and
 
00:38:17.309 --> 00:38:17.319 align:start position:0%
um discuss it and get a model
 
00:38:20.150 --> 00:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
legislation for the rest of the nation I
 
00:38:24.270 --> 00:38:24.280 align:start position:0%
I I I um support interim
 
00:38:28.270 --> 00:38:28.280 align:start position:0%
study thank you um
 
00:38:30.790 --> 00:38:30.800 align:start position:0%
oh representative ger thank you madam
 
00:38:33.190 --> 00:38:33.200 align:start position:0%
chair I had remembered something
 
00:38:35.589 --> 00:38:35.599 align:start position:0%
representative Katon rep representative
 
00:38:37.710 --> 00:38:37.720 align:start position:0%
sopus uh jogged my memory of something
 
00:38:39.190 --> 00:38:39.200 align:start position:0%
else that I wanted to to say that
 
00:38:40.589 --> 00:38:40.599 align:start position:0%
addresses some of the things that they
 
00:38:43.910 --> 00:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
also referred to um I hear what
 
00:38:45.270 --> 00:38:45.280 align:start position:0%
representative kraton is saying about
 
00:38:47.589 --> 00:38:47.599 align:start position:0%
the the Breeders my concern and again it
 
00:38:49.470 --> 00:38:49.480 align:start position:0%
goes back to the testimony that's Pro
 
00:38:50.990 --> 00:38:51.000 align:start position:0%
provided by the vet is that some of
 
00:38:53.550 --> 00:38:53.560 align:start position:0%
these breeding standards are the problem
 
00:38:56.630 --> 00:38:56.640 align:start position:0%
uh he referred to the use of extreme
 
00:38:59.950 --> 00:38:59.960 align:start position:0%
right uh and other language that um is
 
00:39:02.349 --> 00:39:02.359 align:start position:0%
really really disconcerting H so again I
 
00:39:03.790 --> 00:39:03.800 align:start position:0%
think there's a financial incentive
 
00:39:06.349 --> 00:39:06.359 align:start position:0%
that's really powerful here I think that
 
00:39:08.470 --> 00:39:08.480 align:start position:0%
if we're going to the change has to come
 
00:39:10.030 --> 00:39:10.040 align:start position:0%
at that level it certainly does but it's
 
00:39:11.829 --> 00:39:11.839 align:start position:0%
not going to come unless there's
 
00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:14.240 align:start position:0%
actually push back uh against these
 
00:39:16.589 --> 00:39:16.599 align:start position:0%
organizations to tell them that those
 
00:39:19.510 --> 00:39:19.520 align:start position:0%
literally by definition verbatim extreme
 
00:39:21.109 --> 00:39:21.119 align:start position:0%
standards are not acceptable so that's
 
00:39:22.990 --> 00:39:23.000 align:start position:0%
another reason why I would like to see
 
00:39:24.990 --> 00:39:25.000 align:start position:0%
this uh at least have the possibility of
 
00:39:26.670 --> 00:39:26.680 align:start position:0%
going forward thank you representative
 
00:39:29.750 --> 00:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
Bixby uh so I was talking with uh a
 
00:39:32.030 --> 00:39:32.040 align:start position:0%
couple of the folks who testified after
 
00:39:35.510 --> 00:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
the uh hearing and one of the things
 
00:39:38.190 --> 00:39:38.200 align:start position:0%
they pointed out is that uh current
 
00:39:40.470 --> 00:39:40.480 align:start position:0%
breed standards with one exception in
 
00:39:42.829 --> 00:39:42.839 align:start position:0%
the standard for I believe it's French
 
00:39:46.710 --> 00:39:46.720 align:start position:0%
Bulldogs do not use the word extreme and
 
00:39:49.829 --> 00:39:49.839 align:start position:0%
that it is current practice among
 
00:39:53.550 --> 00:39:53.560 align:start position:0%
breeders to have testing for multiple
 
00:39:56.390 --> 00:39:56.400 align:start position:0%
different genetically born conditions in
 
00:39:58.990 --> 00:39:59.000 align:start position:0%
terms of which dogs they select for
 
00:40:04.230 --> 00:40:04.240 align:start position:0%
breeding and that there is a move to uh
 
00:40:06.750 --> 00:40:06.760 align:start position:0%
not breed to the extreme short muszle
 
00:40:10.190 --> 00:40:10.200 align:start position:0%
length uh and so this this
 
00:40:12.910 --> 00:40:12.920 align:start position:0%
is this is something that is developing
 
00:40:16.270 --> 00:40:16.280 align:start position:0%
in the breeding world uh and that show
 
00:40:17.710 --> 00:40:17.720 align:start position:0%
the fact that they're doing this shows
 
00:40:21.109 --> 00:40:21.119 align:start position:0%
that they are responding to it there is
 
00:40:24.230 --> 00:40:24.240 align:start position:0%
uh another Factor here which is that
 
00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
there are those who breed for show there
 
00:40:28.990 --> 00:40:29.000 align:start position:0%
are those who breed for for uh the pet
 
00:40:34.510 --> 00:40:34.520 align:start position:0%
trade and uh the the one people who
 
00:40:36.950 --> 00:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
breed for the pet trade may not feel as
 
00:40:41.270 --> 00:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
constrained to do all of the testing uh
 
00:40:43.309 --> 00:40:43.319 align:start position:0%
especially if they are large out of
 
00:40:44.950 --> 00:40:44.960 align:start position:0%
state breeders who we've heard about in
 
00:40:49.270 --> 00:40:49.280 align:start position:0%
other bills uh and uh the then the
 
00:40:53.589 --> 00:40:53.599 align:start position:0%
question is what do we do about uh the
 
00:40:56.990 --> 00:40:57.000 align:start position:0%
sourcing of animal of of of animals that
 
00:41:01.390 --> 00:41:01.400 align:start position:0%
are are not uh that that have been bred
 
00:41:04.589 --> 00:41:04.599 align:start position:0%
in in a less than ideal way or have
 
00:41:06.150 --> 00:41:06.160 align:start position:0%
their initial raising in a less than
 
00:41:09.030 --> 00:41:09.040 align:start position:0%
ideal way that's something that we have
 
00:41:14.150 --> 00:41:14.160 align:start position:0%
discussed uh as you know and uh in in
 
00:41:16.030 --> 00:41:16.040 align:start position:0%
regard to other bills and I think that
 
00:41:18.309 --> 00:41:18.319 align:start position:0%
that is something we may want to look at
 
00:41:22.150 --> 00:41:22.160 align:start position:0%
in the future uh looking at a broader
 
00:41:27.349 --> 00:41:27.359 align:start position:0%
sense of how do we um how do we control
 
00:41:30.670 --> 00:41:30.680 align:start position:0%
the sourcing of animals into our state
 
00:41:33.150 --> 00:41:33.160 align:start position:0%
uh that may be coming from unscr
 
00:41:36.030 --> 00:41:36.040 align:start position:0%
unscrupulous sources and I I think that
 
00:41:37.990 --> 00:41:38.000 align:start position:0%
that uh that's something that needs to
 
00:41:39.950 --> 00:41:39.960 align:start position:0%
be looked at is something that I don't
 
00:41:42.750 --> 00:41:42.760 align:start position:0%
think is uh something we should do in a
 
00:41:43.950 --> 00:41:43.960 align:start position:0%
study on this
 
00:41:46.990 --> 00:41:47.000 align:start position:0%
bill representative H Haskins thank you
 
00:41:49.470 --> 00:41:49.480 align:start position:0%
madam chair I appreciate uh
 
00:41:51.870 --> 00:41:51.880 align:start position:0%
representative bixby's comments because
 
00:41:54.750 --> 00:41:54.760 align:start position:0%
I think they augur in favor actually of
 
00:41:56.790 --> 00:41:56.800 align:start position:0%
interim study I think we can help the
 
00:41:56.800 --> 00:41:58.069 align:start position:0%
interim study I think we can help the
Breeders

00:41:58.069 --> 00:41:58.079 align:start position:0%
Breeders
 
00:42:01.829 --> 00:42:01.839 align:start position:0%
in this effort to reduce the extreme
 
00:42:04.910 --> 00:42:04.920 align:start position:0%
standards I think that we can as uh
 
00:42:08.030 --> 00:42:08.040 align:start position:0%
representative sakita said um be out in
 
00:42:10.790 --> 00:42:10.800 align:start position:0%
front on this issue that others may look
 
00:42:14.390 --> 00:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
to us for um whatever we determine but
 
00:42:16.430 --> 00:42:16.440 align:start position:0%
it seems to me this is the definition of
 
00:42:19.349 --> 00:42:19.359 align:start position:0%
interim study the the issues that came
 
00:42:22.390 --> 00:42:22.400 align:start position:0%
up are important to all of us and
 
00:42:25.109 --> 00:42:25.119 align:start position:0%
therefore I think interim study is the
 
00:42:28.030 --> 00:42:28.040 align:start position:0%
way to go thank you
 
00:42:28.040 --> 00:42:29.109 align:start position:0%
way to go thank you
represent

00:42:29.109 --> 00:42:29.119 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:42:33.270 --> 00:42:33.280 align:start position:0%
Penza okay so I was an itl and now I'm
 
00:42:35.150 --> 00:42:35.160 align:start position:0%
leaning towards interm study and this is
 
00:42:37.349 --> 00:42:37.359 align:start position:0%
the reason why and I I think what
 
00:42:39.710 --> 00:42:39.720 align:start position:0%
representative H Haskins just said so
 
00:42:42.349 --> 00:42:42.359 align:start position:0%
we've had all of these bills right that
 
00:42:44.430 --> 00:42:44.440 align:start position:0%
have been um they've been killed on the
 
00:42:47.190 --> 00:42:47.200 align:start position:0%
house floor that talk about sourcing and
 
00:42:49.790 --> 00:42:49.800 align:start position:0%
the Pet Shop bill so if this bill goes
 
00:42:53.069 --> 00:42:53.079 align:start position:0%
into interm study and we realize that
 
00:42:55.030 --> 00:42:55.040 align:start position:0%
this can't be handled
 
00:42:57.430 --> 00:42:57.440 align:start position:0%
legislatively and it's really a source
 
00:42:59.430 --> 00:42:59.440 align:start position:0%
issue and maybe there's a pathway to do
 
00:43:01.870 --> 00:43:01.880 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't that be the report that we
 
00:43:04.270 --> 00:43:04.280 align:start position:0%
want to come
 
00:43:07.430 --> 00:43:07.440 align:start position:0%
out any other comments representative
 
00:43:09.670 --> 00:43:09.680 align:start position:0%
Howard thank you madam chair um I just
 
00:43:11.510 --> 00:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
have questions about enforcement I I'm
 
00:43:14.470 --> 00:43:14.480 align:start position:0%
not really sure um exactly at what point
 
00:43:17.390 --> 00:43:17.400 align:start position:0%
um the we inter we intervene on behalf
 
00:43:19.990 --> 00:43:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:22.829 --> 00:43:22.839 align:start position:0%
animals thank you for that
 
00:43:27.710 --> 00:43:27.720 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to support itl on this bill
 
00:43:30.190 --> 00:43:30.200 align:start position:0%
I just think that
 
00:43:33.390 --> 00:43:33.400 align:start position:0%
um from what the testimony I've heard
 
00:43:35.710 --> 00:43:35.720 align:start position:0%
you know our the breeders in the state
 
00:43:37.829 --> 00:43:37.839 align:start position:0%
have been conscientious in breeding
 
00:43:37.839 --> 00:43:38.990 align:start position:0%
have been conscientious in breeding
healthy

00:43:38.990 --> 00:43:39.000 align:start position:0%
healthy
 
00:43:42.030 --> 00:43:42.040 align:start position:0%
animals that seems to be uh you know
 
00:43:45.109 --> 00:43:45.119 align:start position:0%
what they're interested in
 
00:43:49.150 --> 00:43:49.160 align:start position:0%
um the um I think any health
 
00:43:52.349 --> 00:43:52.359 align:start position:0%
issues um are are being continually
 
00:43:54.190 --> 00:43:54.200 align:start position:0%
addressed by the Breeders and the
 
00:43:56.190 --> 00:43:56.200 align:start position:0%
veterinarians in the state I don't
 
00:44:00.309 --> 00:44:00.319 align:start position:0%
believe that we're we're seeing um any
 
00:44:04.670 --> 00:44:04.680 align:start position:0%
of this extreme breeding going on uh nor
 
00:44:07.829 --> 00:44:07.839 align:start position:0%
do we see complaints to the AG's
 
00:44:12.030 --> 00:44:12.040 align:start position:0%
office um for for these kinds of extreme
 
00:44:13.430 --> 00:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
uh breeding
 
00:44:16.069 --> 00:44:16.079 align:start position:0%
activities and um I I think you know
 
00:44:18.630 --> 00:44:18.640 align:start position:0%
we've got some responsible breeders um
 
00:44:20.309 --> 00:44:20.319 align:start position:0%
working to
 
00:44:24.349 --> 00:44:24.359 align:start position:0%
improve the health and um and look of
 
00:44:24.359 --> 00:44:25.069 align:start position:0%
improve the health and um and look of
their

00:44:25.069 --> 00:44:25.079 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:44:29.589 --> 00:44:29.599 align:start position:0%
breeds um and with regard to
 
00:44:32.390 --> 00:44:32.400 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
00:44:36.390 --> 00:44:36.400 align:start position:0%
genetics I there's there's much that
 
00:44:38.470 --> 00:44:38.480 align:start position:0%
breeders can't control when they're
 
00:44:40.910 --> 00:44:40.920 align:start position:0%
doing uh their breeding
 
00:44:45.390 --> 00:44:45.400 align:start position:0%
programs um and I just I I I just don't
 
00:44:47.390 --> 00:44:47.400 align:start position:0%
think that this bill is is an
 
00:44:50.630 --> 00:44:50.640 align:start position:0%
appropriate one representative kto thank
 
00:44:53.549 --> 00:44:53.559 align:start position:0%
you madam chair although I appreciate
 
00:44:54.950 --> 00:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
the intent of the
 
00:44:58.630 --> 00:44:58.640 align:start position:0%
bill I don't uh believe believe um after
 
00:45:00.589 --> 00:45:00.599 align:start position:0%
hearing all the
 
00:45:06.030 --> 00:45:06.040 align:start position:0%
testimony um last week and asking the
 
00:45:08.470 --> 00:45:08.480 align:start position:0%
question that nobody seems to be talking
 
00:45:11.069 --> 00:45:11.079 align:start position:0%
about is environmental
 
00:45:14.750 --> 00:45:14.760 align:start position:0%
impact and what we learned is that
 
00:45:17.670 --> 00:45:17.680 align:start position:0%
although some breeds are more prone and
 
00:45:21.030 --> 00:45:21.040 align:start position:0%
we may have nefarious breeders um what
 
00:45:23.150 --> 00:45:23.160 align:start position:0%
we discovered is there really wasn't any
 
00:45:27.510 --> 00:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
in the state and environmental impacts
 
00:45:29.549 --> 00:45:29.559 align:start position:0%
really can
 
00:45:32.510 --> 00:45:32.520 align:start position:0%
increase the health of these dogs
 
00:45:34.270 --> 00:45:34.280 align:start position:0%
because if they become overweight that
 
00:45:35.309 --> 00:45:35.319 align:start position:0%
affects their
 
00:45:39.349 --> 00:45:39.359 align:start position:0%
breathing and as I had discussed I have
 
00:45:43.230 --> 00:45:43.240 align:start position:0%
had uh a few of these breeds and had no
 
00:45:47.510 --> 00:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
issues I've had uh large dogs that
 
00:45:52.950 --> 00:45:52.960 align:start position:0%
weren't of of this type and a puppy
 
00:45:55.430 --> 00:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
because I do believe
 
00:45:57.710 --> 00:45:57.720 align:start position:0%
environmental factors
 
00:45:59.349 --> 00:45:59.359 align:start position:0%
had some
 
00:46:03.309 --> 00:46:03.319 align:start position:0%
issues and out of 30 puppies
 
00:46:06.670 --> 00:46:06.680 align:start position:0%
one so I think we need to be
 
00:46:10.710 --> 00:46:10.720 align:start position:0%
cognizant that um environmental
 
00:46:14.549 --> 00:46:14.559 align:start position:0%
impact plays a huge role when someone
 
00:46:17.309 --> 00:46:17.319 align:start position:0%
gets a dog or a
 
00:46:20.630 --> 00:46:20.640 align:start position:0%
puppy any other discussion on this
 
00:46:23.710 --> 00:46:23.720 align:start position:0%
bill I would ask now that the clerk call
 
00:46:26.630 --> 00:46:26.640 align:start position:0%

1221 do I hear a
 
00:47:46.510 --> 00:47:46.520 align:start position:0%
motion present
 
00:47:49.990 --> 00:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
come thank you madam chair I would move
 
00:47:54.309 --> 00:47:54.319 align:start position:0%
inim study do I hear a
 
00:47:58.430 --> 00:47:58.440 align:start position:0%
second interim study represent
 
00:48:00.470 --> 00:48:00.480 align:start position:0%
Katon would you like to speak to your
 
00:48:02.950 --> 00:48:02.960 align:start position:0%
motion please representative K thank you
 
00:48:07.270 --> 00:48:07.280 align:start position:0%
madam chair yes um I believe that we
 
00:48:11.549 --> 00:48:11.559 align:start position:0%
heard discussion on this
 
00:48:16.069 --> 00:48:16.079 align:start position:0%
and I think I know that my colleague has
 
00:48:19.309 --> 00:48:19.319 align:start position:0%
an amendment which I also appreciate but
 
00:48:20.750 --> 00:48:20.760 align:start position:0%
we still don't
 
00:48:24.030 --> 00:48:24.040 align:start position:0%
know we haven't had testimony on that
 
00:48:27.549 --> 00:48:27.559 align:start position:0%
and what the impacts of that would be
 
00:48:30.910 --> 00:48:30.920 align:start position:0%
and I think with the passage of the
 
00:48:32.910 --> 00:48:32.920 align:start position:0%
moratorium for
 
00:48:36.670 --> 00:48:36.680 align:start position:0%
landfills that um and because with the
 
00:48:38.990 --> 00:48:39.000 align:start position:0%
moratorium we could really take a dive
 
00:48:41.750 --> 00:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
into this because this would exclude
 
00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:43.390 align:start position:0%
into this because this would exclude
existing

00:48:43.390 --> 00:48:43.400 align:start position:0%
existing
 
00:48:46.950 --> 00:48:46.960 align:start position:0%
landfills this bill excludes existing
 
00:48:49.870 --> 00:48:49.880 align:start position:0%
landfills and no landfill can be cited
 
00:48:51.470 --> 00:48:51.480 align:start position:0%
until July 1
 
00:48:54.150 --> 00:48:54.160 align:start position:0%
2028 which would give us time to really
 
00:48:56.390 --> 00:48:56.400 align:start position:0%
delve in and see what the regional
 
00:48:59.510 --> 00:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
impact fact is what the radius it what
 
00:49:02.549 --> 00:49:02.559 align:start position:0%
radius it really should be with some
 
00:49:05.870 --> 00:49:05.880 align:start position:0%
some study and bring forth the bill in
 
00:49:10.230 --> 00:49:10.240 align:start position:0%
the fall that we've really delved
 
00:49:13.630 --> 00:49:13.640 align:start position:0%
into representive
 
00:49:18.069 --> 00:49:18.079 align:start position:0%
Katon thank you madam chair I I agree
 
00:49:21.589 --> 00:49:21.599 align:start position:0%
with representive compa in the in the
 
00:49:24.950 --> 00:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
questioning 10 miles versus 20 miles and
 
00:49:27.030 --> 00:49:27.040 align:start position:0%
and the impact of that I think 10 miles
 
00:49:28.710 --> 00:49:28.720 align:start position:0%
is better than 20 miles but is it the
 
00:49:30.589 --> 00:49:30.599 align:start position:0%
right one I don't
 
00:49:33.270 --> 00:49:33.280 align:start position:0%
know um but the other thing and if you
 
00:49:36.109 --> 00:49:36.119 align:start position:0%
look at the bill and and this is what I
 
00:49:38.789 --> 00:49:38.799 align:start position:0%
I don't understand under line 20 on page
 
00:49:38.799 --> 00:49:39.750 align:start position:0%
I don't understand under line 20 on page
number

00:49:39.750 --> 00:49:39.760 align:start position:0%
number
 
00:49:43.270 --> 00:49:43.280 align:start position:0%
one uh it says and you got excuse me a
 
00:49:44.670 --> 00:49:44.680 align:start position:0%
second I had my eyes dilated this
 
00:49:49.670 --> 00:49:49.680 align:start position:0%
morning so I'm focusing here um says the
 
00:49:55.069 --> 00:49:55.079 align:start position:0%
local land used board Shell at the same
 
00:49:58.430 --> 00:49:58.440 align:start position:0%
time submit an initial set of plans to
 
00:50:00.910 --> 00:50:00.920 align:start position:0%
the regional Planning Commission the
 
00:50:03.990 --> 00:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
cost of which is borne by the applicant
 
00:50:06.190 --> 00:50:06.200 align:start position:0%
and so what I don't understand is that
 
00:50:09.309 --> 00:50:09.319 align:start position:0%
this bill then requires the local
 
00:50:13.390 --> 00:50:13.400 align:start position:0%
board to submit a plan I don't know what
 
00:50:15.430 --> 00:50:15.440 align:start position:0%
that plan is I don't know it's submitted
 
00:50:17.990 --> 00:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
to I don't know what it's based
 
00:50:21.349 --> 00:50:21.359 align:start position:0%
on um and that that plan that they
 
00:50:23.750 --> 00:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
create then goes back to the waste
 
00:50:27.430 --> 00:50:27.440 align:start position:0%
facility Company to pay for that plan
 
00:50:31.549 --> 00:50:31.559 align:start position:0%
which it just that confuses me I don't
 
00:50:33.789 --> 00:50:33.799 align:start position:0%
understand and I may I may be missing
 
00:50:36.390 --> 00:50:36.400 align:start position:0%
something but I I think an interim study
 
00:50:38.750 --> 00:50:38.760 align:start position:0%
would help clear some of these
 
00:50:40.510 --> 00:50:40.520 align:start position:0%
requirements up because now waste
 
00:50:41.910 --> 00:50:41.920 align:start position:0%
management comes and says hey I want to
 
00:50:44.670 --> 00:50:44.680 align:start position:0%
put this facility in oh by the way town
 
00:50:47.549 --> 00:50:47.559 align:start position:0%
you have to create a plan for it and I
 
00:50:48.829 --> 00:50:48.839 align:start position:0%
have to pay for that plan that you
 
00:50:51.030 --> 00:50:51.040 align:start position:0%
create so I don't know if I'm misreading
 
00:50:52.910 --> 00:50:52.920 align:start position:0%
that but I did it's I don't know to me
 
00:50:54.030 --> 00:50:54.040 align:start position:0%
it's written in
 
00:50:56.589 --> 00:50:56.599 align:start position:0%
English representative Bixby yeah but m
 
00:50:59.109 --> 00:50:59.119 align:start position:0%
mam chair um I believe that uh
 
00:51:00.990 --> 00:51:01.000 align:start position:0%
representative Katon is discussing the
 
00:51:02.470 --> 00:51:02.480 align:start position:0%
amendment and I'm not sure that we all
 
00:51:05.309 --> 00:51:05.319 align:start position:0%
have copies of that yeah I have them
 
00:51:07.510 --> 00:51:07.520 align:start position:0%
sure can you pass it pass it out fair
 
00:51:18.670 --> 00:51:18.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:21.670 --> 00:51:21.680 align:start position:0%
you I do want to make a comment um to
 
00:51:24.109 --> 00:51:24.119 align:start position:0%
representative gerana that I appreciate
 
00:51:26.829 --> 00:51:26.839 align:start position:0%
all the work that he put into um putting
 
00:51:29.950 --> 00:51:29.960 align:start position:0%
this amendment together uh and working
 
00:51:34.150 --> 00:51:34.160 align:start position:0%
with representative grassy on it
 
00:51:37.510 --> 00:51:37.520 align:start position:0%
um I I do also have a
 
00:51:41.710 --> 00:51:41.720 align:start position:0%
concern regarding this particular bill
 
00:51:44.349 --> 00:51:44.359 align:start position:0%
as it relates to Regional impact I
 
00:51:47.750 --> 00:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
received an email this morning from a
 
00:51:50.230 --> 00:51:50.240 align:start position:0%
constituent um of mine in
 
00:51:54.309 --> 00:51:54.319 align:start position:0%
aworth and um he said I I'm writing
 
00:51:56.950 --> 00:51:56.960 align:start position:0%
quickly on hb1 1221 a bill have to do
 
00:51:58.549 --> 00:51:58.559 align:start position:0%
with the definition of development of
 
00:52:00.990 --> 00:52:01.000 align:start position:0%
regional impact which your committee is
 
00:52:03.069 --> 00:52:03.079 align:start position:0%
scheduled to EXA today the underlying
 
00:52:05.309 --> 00:52:05.319 align:start position:0%
issue has to do with 15 or so towns in
 
00:52:07.990 --> 00:52:08.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire without zoning I wondered
 
00:52:10.630 --> 00:52:10.640 align:start position:0%
whether RAC tracks might also be subject
 
00:52:13.190 --> 00:52:13.200 align:start position:0%
to a determination of developments of
 
00:52:16.230 --> 00:52:16.240 align:start position:0%
regional impact and and so you know
 
00:52:19.270 --> 00:52:19.280 align:start position:0%
while I understand this
 
00:52:22.829 --> 00:52:22.839 align:start position:0%
particular bill is talking about Solid
 
00:52:22.839 --> 00:52:24.750 align:start position:0%
particular bill is talking about Solid
Waste

00:52:24.750 --> 00:52:24.760 align:start position:0%
Waste
 
00:52:27.470 --> 00:52:27.480 align:start position:0%
landfills I I would would like to have a
 
00:52:29.750 --> 00:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
little bit more time to study this to
 
00:52:32.549 --> 00:52:32.559 align:start position:0%
see how it would re relate to other
 
00:52:35.789 --> 00:52:35.799 align:start position:0%
projects um that are being considered in
 
00:52:40.069 --> 00:52:40.079 align:start position:0%
a particular area of the state um and if
 
00:52:42.990 --> 00:52:43.000 align:start position:0%
if this is setting any sort of precedent
 
00:52:44.950 --> 00:52:44.960 align:start position:0%
that might
 
00:52:50.670 --> 00:52:50.680 align:start position:0%
be utilized to prevent projects which
 
00:52:52.870 --> 00:52:52.880 align:start position:0%
might be good projects from being
 
00:52:56.109 --> 00:52:56.119 align:start position:0%
brought uh into different places of the
 
00:52:58.630 --> 00:52:58.640 align:start position:0%
state so I I I kind of would like to
 
00:53:01.789 --> 00:53:01.799 align:start position:0%
have a little bit of time to um to study
 
00:53:03.990 --> 00:53:04.000 align:start position:0%
the issue of what are we what are we
 
00:53:05.829 --> 00:53:05.839 align:start position:0%
talking about when we're talking about
 
00:53:08.789 --> 00:53:08.799 align:start position:0%
Regional impact do we just limit it to
 
00:53:11.829 --> 00:53:11.839 align:start position:0%
Solid Waste landfills or should we talk
 
00:53:15.510 --> 00:53:15.520 align:start position:0%
about uh you know other things going
 
00:53:18.789 --> 00:53:18.799 align:start position:0%
on representative ger thank you madam
 
00:53:20.030 --> 00:53:20.040 align:start position:0%
chair and I appreciate your your
 
00:53:22.549 --> 00:53:22.559 align:start position:0%
previous comments uh I I think looking
 
00:53:25.069 --> 00:53:25.079 align:start position:0%
at RSA
 
00:53:27.670 --> 00:53:27.680 align:start position:0%
3654 talking about the the purpose of
 
00:53:31.150 --> 00:53:31.160 align:start position:0%
this chapter uh in RSA the purpose of
 
00:53:32.789 --> 00:53:32.799 align:start position:0%
the subdivision is to provide timely
 
00:53:34.190 --> 00:53:34.200 align:start position:0%
notice to potentially affected
 
00:53:36.430 --> 00:53:36.440 align:start position:0%
municipalities concerning proposed
 
00:53:38.510 --> 00:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
developments which are likely to have
 
00:53:40.150 --> 00:53:40.160 align:start position:0%
impacts beyond the boundaries of a
 
00:53:42.710 --> 00:53:42.720 align:start position:0%
single municipality uh and looking at
 
00:53:44.950 --> 00:53:44.960 align:start position:0%
the the rest of the chapter here uh in
 
00:53:49.950 --> 00:53:49.960 align:start position:0%
my mind this is uh exactly what this
 
00:53:51.829 --> 00:53:51.839 align:start position:0%
statute exists to do we're adding
 
00:53:54.670 --> 00:53:54.680 align:start position:0%
landfills in among other kinds of
 
00:53:57.510 --> 00:53:57.520 align:start position:0%
projects in the state that by definition
 
00:54:00.230 --> 00:54:00.240 align:start position:0%
have a have a regional impact uh we have
 
00:54:03.430 --> 00:54:03.440 align:start position:0%
as as the chairwoman pointed out uh we
 
00:54:06.230 --> 00:54:06.240 align:start position:0%
have made some changes in the amendment
 
00:54:07.950 --> 00:54:07.960 align:start position:0%
that that we've circulated here that
 
00:54:11.069 --> 00:54:11.079 align:start position:0%
brings it down to 10 miles 10 miles and
 
00:54:12.710 --> 00:54:12.720 align:start position:0%
if if possible perhaps representative
 
00:54:15.190 --> 00:54:15.200 align:start position:0%
grassy could speak to this uh bringing
 
00:54:18.069 --> 00:54:18.079 align:start position:0%
it under that is simply not going to be
 
00:54:19.710 --> 00:54:19.720 align:start position:0%
uh effective and so we brought it down
 
00:54:22.390 --> 00:54:22.400 align:start position:0%
to the mile distance that was kind of
 
00:54:24.789 --> 00:54:24.799 align:start position:0%
the minimum distance that would
 
00:54:26.789 --> 00:54:26.799 align:start position:0%
genuinely be effective we talked about
 
00:54:29.670 --> 00:54:29.680 align:start position:0%
15 but 10 is as far as we could bring it
 
00:54:31.549 --> 00:54:31.559 align:start position:0%
down and I have a sense looking at the
 
00:54:33.349 --> 00:54:33.359 align:start position:0%
watersheds that it would actually be a
 
00:54:35.910 --> 00:54:35.920 align:start position:0%
meaningful change uh representative
 
00:54:38.670 --> 00:54:38.680 align:start position:0%
Grassi also worked with Mr deer at Dees
 
00:54:39.950 --> 00:54:39.960 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we had the right
 
00:54:42.870 --> 00:54:42.880 align:start position:0%
Watershed map uh so that we are using
 
00:54:45.630 --> 00:54:45.640 align:start position:0%
the data uh and the map that Dees would
 
00:54:47.470 --> 00:54:47.480 align:start position:0%
be using as they were looking at these
 
00:54:51.150 --> 00:54:51.160 align:start position:0%
watersheds so uh I as I said I I believe
 
00:54:53.789 --> 00:54:53.799 align:start position:0%
that this fits squarely into the chapter
 
00:54:56.349 --> 00:54:56.359 align:start position:0%
as it currently exists it was for Purp
 
00:54:59.630 --> 00:54:59.640 align:start position:0%
purposes like this that this chapter I
 
00:55:01.990 --> 00:55:02.000 align:start position:0%
think was written fits perfectly so I
 
00:55:05.230 --> 00:55:05.240 align:start position:0%
hear what uh what Madam chair is saying
 
00:55:06.789 --> 00:55:06.799 align:start position:0%
about whether or not there might be
 
00:55:08.430 --> 00:55:08.440 align:start position:0%
other kinds of projects that would be
 
00:55:10.510 --> 00:55:10.520 align:start position:0%
suitable I think that's a good question
 
00:55:12.750 --> 00:55:12.760 align:start position:0%
but I don't think that question should
 
00:55:15.470 --> 00:55:15.480 align:start position:0%
be uh should limit us from taking action
 
00:55:17.589 --> 00:55:17.599 align:start position:0%
in a case where you know we clearly can
 
00:55:20.190 --> 00:55:20.200 align:start position:0%
identify it and I don't know Madam chair
 
00:55:22.990 --> 00:55:23.000 align:start position:0%
if if we might ask representative grassy
 
00:55:25.109 --> 00:55:25.119 align:start position:0%
um who has spoken directly with Dees on
 
00:55:26.309 --> 00:55:26.319 align:start position:0%
some of these issues if he could click
 
00:55:28.190 --> 00:55:28.200 align:start position:0%
clarify some of the questions not at
 
00:55:28.200 --> 00:55:29.470 align:start position:0%
clarify some of the questions not at
this

00:55:29.470 --> 00:55:29.480 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:55:32.430 --> 00:55:32.440 align:start position:0%
time okay so I I think that again that's
 
00:55:33.789 --> 00:55:33.799 align:start position:0%
what the statute was written for we're
 
00:55:36.549 --> 00:55:36.559 align:start position:0%
adding landfills is clearly uh these are
 
00:55:38.670 --> 00:55:38.680 align:start position:0%
projects that have Regional uh impact by
 
00:55:41.270 --> 00:55:41.280 align:start position:0%
development uh by definition I'm sorry
 
00:55:43.549 --> 00:55:43.559 align:start position:0%
uh and I think we should move forward
 
00:55:47.710 --> 00:55:47.720 align:start position:0%
okay representative Bixby yeah so um
 
00:55:50.789 --> 00:55:50.799 align:start position:0%
there there the the question of whether
 
00:55:53.510 --> 00:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
Mission creep is possible and whether
 
00:55:57.589 --> 00:55:57.599 align:start position:0%
this would encourage it uh any
 
00:56:01.230 --> 00:56:01.240 align:start position:0%
other uh any other facility or type of
 
00:56:03.950 --> 00:56:03.960 align:start position:0%
uh of development that someone was
 
00:56:07.710 --> 00:56:07.720 align:start position:0%
concerned about could be a proposed as a
 
00:56:11.829 --> 00:56:11.839 align:start position:0%
bill whether or not we do we pass this
 
00:56:17.309 --> 00:56:17.319 align:start position:0%
uh so uh that is so essentially this is
 
00:56:20.910 --> 00:56:20.920 align:start position:0%
uh this is really has a very specific
 
00:56:24.829 --> 00:56:24.839 align:start position:0%
Focus which is uh landfill Solid Waste
 
00:56:26.910 --> 00:56:26.920 align:start position:0%
landfills that
 
00:56:29.910 --> 00:56:29.920 align:start position:0%
uh would be large enough to have a
 
00:56:35.829 --> 00:56:35.839 align:start position:0%
regional impact and uh so the so um I
 
00:56:37.990 --> 00:56:38.000 align:start position:0%
think that this bill is very very
 
00:56:42.150 --> 00:56:42.160 align:start position:0%
clearly targeted uh I think that the um
 
00:56:44.069 --> 00:56:44.079 align:start position:0%
I I think that the 10 Mile boundary
 
00:56:46.910 --> 00:56:46.920 align:start position:0%
makes a lot of sense I think that I
 
00:56:51.390 --> 00:56:51.400 align:start position:0%
really appreciate uh uh getting the uh
 
00:56:55.430 --> 00:56:55.440 align:start position:0%
Watershed map that very very clearly
 
00:56:58.910 --> 00:56:58.920 align:start position:0%
defines the smaller size of watersheds
 
00:57:02.589 --> 00:57:02.599 align:start position:0%
that would be uh used in order to make
 
00:57:06.270 --> 00:57:06.280 align:start position:0%
the determination here uh
 
00:57:10.829 --> 00:57:10.839 align:start position:0%
and uh in terms of uh what's required to
 
00:57:15.109 --> 00:57:15.119 align:start position:0%
be uh done for notification that the
 
00:57:17.750 --> 00:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
notification is done to
 
00:57:19.870 --> 00:57:19.880 align:start position:0%
municipalities and for the out of state
 
00:57:22.390 --> 00:57:22.400 align:start position:0%
is done to the Secretary of State those
 
00:57:24.430 --> 00:57:24.440 align:start position:0%
that's a very small number of
 
00:57:26.910 --> 00:57:26.920 align:start position:0%
notifications uh so
 
00:57:32.190 --> 00:57:32.200 align:start position:0%
uh and uh so I think that uh this is
 
00:57:33.870 --> 00:57:33.880 align:start position:0%
very reasonable in terms of what it
 
00:57:35.109 --> 00:57:35.119 align:start position:0%
proposes it
 
00:57:37.549 --> 00:57:37.559 align:start position:0%
also covers the territory very
 
00:57:40.270 --> 00:57:40.280 align:start position:0%
thoroughly I I think that the question
 
00:57:42.510 --> 00:57:42.520 align:start position:0%
is do we think notification is an
 
00:57:44.710 --> 00:57:44.720 align:start position:0%
appropriate action in which case we
 
00:57:48.109 --> 00:57:48.119 align:start position:0%
should pass this or do we think that an
 
00:57:50.230 --> 00:57:50.240 align:start position:0%
that notification is an inappropriate
 
00:57:52.950 --> 00:57:52.960 align:start position:0%
action in which case we should itl it I
 
00:57:54.549 --> 00:57:54.559 align:start position:0%
don't think there's anything here to
 
00:57:57.430 --> 00:57:57.440 align:start position:0%
study representative hins thank you
 
00:57:59.190 --> 00:57:59.200 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
00:58:02.390 --> 00:58:02.400 align:start position:0%
um this is a very important bill and a
 
00:58:05.270 --> 00:58:05.280 align:start position:0%
lot of work has gone into it we can't
 
00:58:09.270 --> 00:58:09.280 align:start position:0%
solve all of our Solid Waste problems
 
00:58:13.069 --> 00:58:13.079 align:start position:0%
easily or overnight but this is one step
 
00:58:16.670 --> 00:58:16.680 align:start position:0%
toward getting us to recognize the
 
00:58:20.470 --> 00:58:20.480 align:start position:0%
impact that landfills have on the area
 
00:58:23.150 --> 00:58:23.160 align:start position:0%
around them for instance Whitefield and
 
00:58:25.789 --> 00:58:25.799 align:start position:0%
Littleton and places that are not in the
 
00:58:28.549 --> 00:58:28.559 align:start position:0%
town town where a landfill might be
 
00:58:33.230 --> 00:58:33.240 align:start position:0%
built so with respect I don't I don't
 
00:58:35.430 --> 00:58:35.440 align:start position:0%
think we need to study it I think we
 
00:58:39.190 --> 00:58:39.200 align:start position:0%
know why we need it and this is almost
 
00:58:42.230 --> 00:58:42.240 align:start position:0%
um helping a an Omission that now that
 
00:58:45.150 --> 00:58:45.160 align:start position:0%
we understand the impact that landfills
 
00:58:47.870 --> 00:58:47.880 align:start position:0%
have on the region around them we can
 
00:58:50.470 --> 00:58:50.480 align:start position:0%
simply insert them in the bill in the
 
00:58:53.190 --> 00:58:53.200 align:start position:0%
law that we already have thank you okay
 
00:58:53.200 --> 00:58:55.029 align:start position:0%
law that we already have thank you okay
representative

00:58:55.029 --> 00:58:55.039 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:58:59.549 --> 00:58:59.559 align:start position:0%
smart thank you madam chair um
 
00:59:03.029 --> 00:59:03.039 align:start position:0%
I I I don't I guess I don't understand
 
00:59:07.190 --> 00:59:07.200 align:start position:0%
if we have a bill that we have have
 
00:59:09.190 --> 00:59:09.200 align:start position:0%
decided it's been passed that we're
 
00:59:11.910 --> 00:59:11.920 align:start position:0%
going to wait and we have a moratorium
 
00:59:14.589 --> 00:59:14.599 align:start position:0%
on landfill any landfill decisions
 
00:59:17.069 --> 00:59:17.079 align:start position:0%
because we're trying to get it right why
 
00:59:19.430 --> 00:59:19.440 align:start position:0%
would we pass something that has
 
00:59:22.829 --> 00:59:22.839 align:start position:0%
something to do with landfill now when
 
00:59:25.750 --> 00:59:25.760 align:start position:0%
we haven't got all the information to
 
00:59:27.789 --> 00:59:27.799 align:start position:0%
get everything right we have a portion
 
00:59:31.349 --> 00:59:31.359 align:start position:0%
of information so why can't this go into
 
00:59:34.589 --> 00:59:34.599 align:start position:0%
the the landfill
 
00:59:37.710 --> 00:59:37.720 align:start position:0%
bill when we finally come up with
 
00:59:41.549 --> 00:59:41.559 align:start position:0%
one am I making that everybody looks
 
00:59:44.510 --> 00:59:44.520 align:start position:0%
puzzled I I don't know that we have any
 
00:59:47.750 --> 00:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
other Bill well didn't didn't we say we
 
00:59:49.750 --> 00:59:49.760 align:start position:0%
were G to put a moratorium on any
 
00:59:53.029 --> 00:59:53.039 align:start position:0%
landfills for till
 
00:59:55.870 --> 00:59:55.880 align:start position:0%
2028 that's that's past the house yes
 
00:59:59.349 --> 00:59:59.359 align:start position:0%
right and so Dees was going to WR rules
 
01:00:00.430 --> 01:00:00.440 align:start position:0%
that's what we're waiting for not
 
01:00:02.230 --> 01:00:02.240 align:start position:0%
another bill okay so why can't this go
 
01:00:04.670 --> 01:00:04.680 align:start position:0%
in with that why do we have to decide on
 
01:00:08.910 --> 01:00:08.920 align:start position:0%
something now why not itl it yeah
 
01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:10.069 align:start position:0%
something now why not itl it yeah
represent

01:00:10.069 --> 01:00:10.079 align:start position:0%
represent
 
01:00:12.589 --> 01:00:12.599 align:start position:0%
Penza so this isn't this isn't a
 
01:00:15.230 --> 01:00:15.240 align:start position:0%
landfill bill this is really a a like a
 
01:00:18.309 --> 01:00:18.319 align:start position:0%
public notice bill um I don't think it
 
01:00:20.870 --> 01:00:20.880 align:start position:0%
needs to be studied uh if everybody's
 
01:00:23.589 --> 01:00:23.599 align:start position:0%
read you know um
 
01:00:27.349 --> 01:00:27.359 align:start position:0%
3655 it's pretty clear it's a very small
 
01:00:29.270 --> 01:00:29.280 align:start position:0%
um Regional planning commission's
 
01:00:31.670 --> 01:00:31.680 align:start position:0%
statement and it has there you know
 
01:00:33.190 --> 01:00:33.200 align:start position:0%
proximity to borders of a neighboring
 
01:00:35.470 --> 01:00:35.480 align:start position:0%
Community anticipated emissions such as
 
01:00:37.789 --> 01:00:37.799 align:start position:0%
light noise smoke odors particles
 
01:00:40.109 --> 01:00:40.119 align:start position:0%
proximity to aquifers or surface waters
 
01:00:42.069 --> 01:00:42.079 align:start position:0%
which transcend Municipal boundaries
 
01:00:44.470 --> 01:00:44.480 align:start position:0%
shared facilities such as schools and
 
01:00:48.109 --> 01:00:48.119 align:start position:0%
solid waste disposal facilities so how
 
01:00:50.589 --> 01:00:50.599 align:start position:0%
this was first put out I could not
 
01:00:53.430 --> 01:00:53.440 align:start position:0%
support but how it's put now which I
 
01:00:56.270 --> 01:00:56.280 align:start position:0%
think appeases many on my side of the
 
01:00:58.829 --> 01:00:58.839 align:start position:0%
aisle where you know current landfill
 
01:01:02.150 --> 01:01:02.160 align:start position:0%
operations are exempt from this um and
 
01:01:06.270 --> 01:01:06.280 align:start position:0%
this is really a notice um 10 miles you
 
01:01:08.710 --> 01:01:08.720 align:start position:0%
know I don't I that's the one piece that
 
01:01:10.470 --> 01:01:10.480 align:start position:0%
I will agree I think it was
 
01:01:12.589 --> 01:01:12.599 align:start position:0%
representative I'm not sure which
 
01:01:14.270 --> 01:01:14.280 align:start position:0%
representative said that you know what
 
01:01:17.069 --> 01:01:17.079 align:start position:0%
the miles is I'm very happy that the
 
01:01:20.109 --> 01:01:20.119 align:start position:0%
Watershed um was discussed specifically
 
01:01:22.069 --> 01:01:22.079 align:start position:0%
with Dees so they've confirmed that we
 
01:01:25.309 --> 01:01:25.319 align:start position:0%
have correct information um you know I
 
01:01:26.990 --> 01:01:27.000 align:start position:0%
think there's an opportunity for this to
 
01:01:29.589 --> 01:01:29.599 align:start position:0%
pass our body but not the other one and
 
01:01:31.589 --> 01:01:31.599 align:start position:0%
uh I I think we should move forward with
 
01:01:33.470 --> 01:01:33.480 align:start position:0%
this it's really about public
 
01:01:35.670 --> 01:01:35.680 align:start position:0%
notice representative
 
01:01:38.349 --> 01:01:38.359 align:start position:0%
Morris thank you madam chair um I would
 
01:01:40.549 --> 01:01:40.559 align:start position:0%
just like to really sort of agree with
 
01:01:42.829 --> 01:01:42.839 align:start position:0%
representative Penza on this and as a
 
01:01:44.470 --> 01:01:44.480 align:start position:0%
planning board member who frequently
 
01:01:46.950 --> 01:01:46.960 align:start position:0%
deals with uh Regional impact
 
01:01:49.069 --> 01:01:49.079 align:start position:0%
notifications this is very
 
01:01:52.190 --> 01:01:52.200 align:start position:0%
straightforward this is stuff that we do
 
01:01:56.430 --> 01:01:56.440 align:start position:0%
frequently we have a process it it this
 
01:01:59.470 --> 01:01:59.480 align:start position:0%
just allows us to make sure that our
 
01:02:01.589 --> 01:02:01.599 align:start position:0%
communities are aware make sure that
 
01:02:04.109 --> 01:02:04.119 align:start position:0%
people who you know might need to have
 
01:02:06.430 --> 01:02:06.440 align:start position:0%
some sort of involvement in the process
 
01:02:08.750 --> 01:02:08.760 align:start position:0%
are notified and involved and I I think
 
01:02:12.390 --> 01:02:12.400 align:start position:0%
that um if you don't have experience
 
01:02:15.150 --> 01:02:15.160 align:start position:0%
with that these can all seem very
 
01:02:18.029 --> 01:02:18.039 align:start position:0%
confusing and hard to understand but um
 
01:02:19.789 --> 01:02:19.799 align:start position:0%
those who serve on planning commissions
 
01:02:21.750 --> 01:02:21.760 align:start position:0%
and those who you know frequently do
 
01:02:23.670 --> 01:02:23.680 align:start position:0%
Regional impacts this this is very
 
01:02:26.309 --> 01:02:26.319 align:start position:0%
straightforward I I support you know PPA
 
01:02:29.470 --> 01:02:29.480 align:start position:0%
on this okay representative
 
01:02:34.029 --> 01:02:34.039 align:start position:0%
Howard um it seems the fear of the of
 
01:02:36.510 --> 01:02:36.520 align:start position:0%
what um representative Bixby calls a
 
01:02:39.069 --> 01:02:39.079 align:start position:0%
mission creep um if if this were to be
 
01:02:42.829 --> 01:02:42.839 align:start position:0%
appli applied to noise in in a region
 
01:02:45.829 --> 01:02:45.839 align:start position:0%
rather than rather than um water
 
01:02:47.589 --> 01:02:47.599 align:start position:0%
underground I I don't think that would
 
01:02:49.510 --> 01:02:49.520 align:start position:0%
be I don't think that's a big risk right
 
01:02:51.549 --> 01:02:51.559 align:start position:0%
now I I think that it's probably
 
01:02:53.029 --> 01:02:53.039 align:start position:0%
something that you'd want to talk about
 
01:02:57.950 --> 01:02:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:59.710 --> 01:02:59.720 align:start position:0%
representative Murray thank you madam
 
01:03:01.750 --> 01:03:01.760 align:start position:0%
chair I also um will not be supporting
 
01:03:06.390 --> 01:03:06.400 align:start position:0%
interim study I I think that this is um
 
01:03:08.230 --> 01:03:08.240 align:start position:0%
in this current motion I think that this
 
01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:09.589 align:start position:0%
in this current motion I think that this
is

01:03:09.589 --> 01:03:09.599 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:03:12.190 --> 01:03:12.200 align:start position:0%
um appropriate as representative Moore
 
01:03:14.710 --> 01:03:14.720 align:start position:0%
said I also think that when we're asking
 
01:03:18.589 --> 01:03:18.599 align:start position:0%
for regional impact um notifications um
 
01:03:19.910 --> 01:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
like representative Moore said this
 
01:03:21.109 --> 01:03:21.119 align:start position:0%
happens all the time when we see
 
01:03:22.190 --> 01:03:22.200 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation
 
01:03:23.670 --> 01:03:23.680 align:start position:0%
notifications or 10year planning
 
01:03:26.390 --> 01:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
commissions come before um local um
 
01:03:28.630 --> 01:03:28.640 align:start position:0%
zoning commissions or boards um we see
 
01:03:33.910 --> 01:03:33.920 align:start position:0%
that um so yes I um agree that this is
 
01:03:37.990 --> 01:03:38.000 align:start position:0%
just more of a notification sort of
 
01:03:40.349 --> 01:03:40.359 align:start position:0%
circumstance okay thank you
 
01:03:42.589 --> 01:03:42.599 align:start position:0%
representative ktoa thank you madam
 
01:03:45.349 --> 01:03:45.359 align:start position:0%
chair it's not about the notification
 
01:03:49.670 --> 01:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
it's just for me I haven't heard any
 
01:03:51.349 --> 01:03:51.359 align:start position:0%
information we talked about the
 
01:03:53.990 --> 01:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
Watershed we talked about the original
 
01:03:55.990 --> 01:03:56.000 align:start position:0%
mile range but I don't know what the
 
01:03:58.789 --> 01:03:58.799 align:start position:0%
impact of this one is and for me that's
 
01:04:00.430 --> 01:04:00.440 align:start position:0%
the question I don't
 
01:04:03.630 --> 01:04:03.640 align:start position:0%
know so that's why I'm asking for that
 
01:04:06.190 --> 01:04:06.200 align:start position:0%
because I haven't heard any testimony
 
01:04:09.950 --> 01:04:09.960 align:start position:0%
regarding the 10 mile radius is
 
01:04:13.069 --> 01:04:13.079 align:start position:0%
basically what it is it is a radius so
 
01:04:14.950 --> 01:04:14.960 align:start position:0%
that is my question just I want to
 
01:04:17.069 --> 01:04:17.079 align:start position:0%
clarify that for everyone because I
 
01:04:18.670 --> 01:04:18.680 align:start position:0%
don't know what the impact is I haven't
 
01:04:21.589 --> 01:04:21.599 align:start position:0%
seen a map on that and I really would
 
01:04:23.990 --> 01:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
like to know
 
01:04:28.390 --> 01:04:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:31.150 --> 01:04:31.160 align:start position:0%
Madam chair would it be okay if I asked
 
01:04:33.029 --> 01:04:33.039 align:start position:0%
rep Morris a question based on her
 
01:04:34.430 --> 01:04:34.440 align:start position:0%
planning board experience sure
 
01:04:36.870 --> 01:04:36.880 align:start position:0%
absolutely so looking at did you get a
 
01:04:39.549 --> 01:04:39.559 align:start position:0%
chance to look at that sentence that I
 
01:04:41.430 --> 01:04:41.440 align:start position:0%
put on that I I highlighted at the
 
01:04:47.230 --> 01:04:47.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:51.269 --> 01:04:51.279 align:start position:0%
21 the local lamb board shell yeah what
 
01:04:53.750 --> 01:04:53.760 align:start position:0%
are your thoughts on that
 
01:05:01.390 --> 01:05:01.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:04.549 --> 01:05:04.559 align:start position:0%
so basically this is a fairly
 
01:05:06.549 --> 01:05:06.559 align:start position:0%
straightforward way that this
 
01:05:12.510 --> 01:05:12.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:15.029 --> 01:05:15.039 align:start position:0%
um my planning board deals with a lot of
 
01:05:18.390 --> 01:05:18.400 align:start position:0%
uh subdivisions right so we have to take
 
01:05:20.109 --> 01:05:20.119 align:start position:0%
a look at those subdivisions and say
 
01:05:22.710 --> 01:05:22.720 align:start position:0%
does this have Regional impact is it is
 
01:05:25.230 --> 01:05:25.240 align:start position:0%
it bordering on a lot that touches one
 
01:05:28.109 --> 01:05:28.119 align:start position:0%
of the other towns in our area and so it
 
01:05:30.430 --> 01:05:30.440 align:start position:0%
is always the responsibility of the
 
01:05:33.670 --> 01:05:33.680 align:start position:0%
person who is doing the subdivision or
 
01:05:35.510 --> 01:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
suggesting you know that they're going
 
01:05:37.630 --> 01:05:37.640 align:start position:0%
to bring in some sort of development or
 
01:05:39.789 --> 01:05:39.799 align:start position:0%
anything like that they will be
 
01:05:43.349 --> 01:05:43.359 align:start position:0%
responsible for um paying for any kind
 
01:05:47.190 --> 01:05:47.200 align:start position:0%
of notification any kind of surveys any
 
01:05:49.670 --> 01:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
of those things so my understanding of
 
01:05:52.549 --> 01:05:52.559 align:start position:0%
this is that it falls in line with
 
01:05:56.549 --> 01:05:56.559 align:start position:0%
basically all of the um notifications
 
01:05:58.470 --> 01:05:58.480 align:start position:0%
Regional impact everything that I'm
 
01:06:00.269 --> 01:06:00.279 align:start position:0%
involved with on my planning board I'm
 
01:06:04.430 --> 01:06:04.440 align:start position:0%
also um in close contact with our
 
01:06:07.069 --> 01:06:07.079 align:start position:0%
regional Lake sunap Upper Valley
 
01:06:08.510 --> 01:06:08.520 align:start position:0%
Regional Planning Commission whatever it
 
01:06:11.870 --> 01:06:11.880 align:start position:0%
is um and it all pretty much functions
 
01:06:13.349 --> 01:06:13.359 align:start position:0%
the same way because of the rsas that
 
01:06:15.349 --> 01:06:15.359 align:start position:0%
already exist that have been cited in in
 
01:06:18.390 --> 01:06:18.400 align:start position:0%
this amendment so it doesn't in my
 
01:06:20.230 --> 01:06:20.240 align:start position:0%
opinion cause any confusion to the
 
01:06:23.870 --> 01:06:23.880 align:start position:0%
people who are um going to be doing the
 
01:06:26.870 --> 01:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
work as well as um you know when we're
 
01:06:29.029 --> 01:06:29.039 align:start position:0%
talking about setbacks and those things
 
01:06:31.589 --> 01:06:31.599 align:start position:0%
to sort of go back to representative K's
 
01:06:34.190 --> 01:06:34.200 align:start position:0%
question it's it's really just saying
 
01:06:37.029 --> 01:06:37.039 align:start position:0%
within this amount of space could there
 
01:06:39.870 --> 01:06:39.880 align:start position:0%
be an impact to this
 
01:06:42.910 --> 01:06:42.920 align:start position:0%
community's resources in in whatever way
 
01:06:46.029 --> 01:06:46.039 align:start position:0%
whether it's you know a watershed or a
 
01:06:47.910 --> 01:06:47.920 align:start position:0%
lake or any of these other things these
 
01:06:49.670 --> 01:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
are these are just things that uh the
 
01:06:51.910 --> 01:06:51.920 align:start position:0%
planning board we sit through we look at
 
01:06:53.870 --> 01:06:53.880 align:start position:0%
all of these different things we ask
 
01:06:56.269 --> 01:06:56.279 align:start position:0%
questions and then we vote to decide is
 
01:06:57.990 --> 01:06:58.000 align:start position:0%
this something that we need to address
 
01:06:59.829 --> 01:06:59.839 align:start position:0%
as Regional impact and this just gives a
 
01:07:02.269 --> 01:07:02.279 align:start position:0%
little bit more guidance for those
 
01:07:04.190 --> 01:07:04.200 align:start position:0%
boards and committees to be able to say
 
01:07:07.549 --> 01:07:07.559 align:start position:0%
okay this this does require that we
 
01:07:07.559 --> 01:07:09.269 align:start position:0%
okay this this does require that we
notify

01:07:09.269 --> 01:07:09.279 align:start position:0%
notify
 
01:07:11.789 --> 01:07:11.799 align:start position:0%
someone quick followup should quick
 
01:07:13.670 --> 01:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
followup and then I have a question for
 
01:07:16.470 --> 01:07:16.480 align:start position:0%
representative ger and so okay just to
 
01:07:19.630 --> 01:07:19.640 align:start position:0%
be clear then so when it says that it
 
01:07:22.750 --> 01:07:22.760 align:start position:0%
directs the planning board to come up
 
01:07:25.230 --> 01:07:25.240 align:start position:0%
with a plan which is additional work but
 
01:07:27.870 --> 01:07:27.880 align:start position:0%
you normally expect that to happen
 
01:07:30.069 --> 01:07:30.079 align:start position:0%
absolutely okay yeah we're we're all
 
01:07:32.390 --> 01:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
completely prepared to to take on any
 
01:07:34.470 --> 01:07:34.480 align:start position:0%
additional work that requires any
 
01:07:36.950 --> 01:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
planning we have resources and people
 
01:07:38.549 --> 01:07:38.559 align:start position:0%
that we normally work with to address
 
01:07:40.630 --> 01:07:40.640 align:start position:0%
any of those concerns okay thank you
 
01:07:42.549 --> 01:07:42.559 align:start position:0%
sure so I have a question for
 
01:07:46.589 --> 01:07:46.599 align:start position:0%
representative ger and so far as um we
 
01:07:49.029 --> 01:07:49.039 align:start position:0%
are sticking in this paragraph or
 
01:07:55.190 --> 01:07:55.200 align:start position:0%
section three into RSA 36 colon 56 which
 
01:07:57.390 --> 01:07:57.400 align:start position:0%
is review of developments of regional
 
01:08:01.630 --> 01:08:01.640 align:start position:0%
impact and so what we're adding in is
 
01:08:03.910 --> 01:08:03.920 align:start position:0%
that located with any Watershed as
 
01:08:06.230 --> 01:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
defined by the eight digigit hydrologic
 
01:08:08.829 --> 01:08:08.839 align:start position:0%
units from the national hydrography data
 
01:08:11.910 --> 01:08:11.920 align:start position:0%
set 2011 and as may be from time to time
 
01:08:13.710 --> 01:08:13.720 align:start position:0%
amended where such landfill may be
 
01:08:16.070 --> 01:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
proposed if outside the Watershed
 
01:08:18.110 --> 01:08:18.120 align:start position:0%
located within 10 miles and so that we
 
01:08:21.070 --> 01:08:21.080 align:start position:0%
are saying all proposed Solid Waste
 
01:08:22.990 --> 01:08:23.000 align:start position:0%
landfills shall be projects of regional
 
01:08:25.070 --> 01:08:25.080 align:start position:0%
impact and notice shall be made to the
 
01:08:25.080 --> 01:08:26.110 align:start position:0%
impact and notice shall be made to the
all

01:08:26.110 --> 01:08:26.120 align:start position:0%
all
 
01:08:28.630 --> 01:08:28.640 align:start position:0%
communities located within New Hampshire
 
01:08:32.149 --> 01:08:32.159 align:start position:0%
so that the regional Planning
 
01:08:35.189 --> 01:08:35.199 align:start position:0%
Commission isn't making that
 
01:08:38.430 --> 01:08:38.440 align:start position:0%
notice but it's being put in their
 
01:08:42.030 --> 01:08:42.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:45.269 --> 01:08:45.279 align:start position:0%
that who's the notification I thought
 
01:08:49.470 --> 01:08:49.480 align:start position:0%
was coming from the landfill people it
 
01:08:52.030 --> 01:08:52.040 align:start position:0%
is okay it is too and and I would also I
 
01:08:55.110 --> 01:08:55.120 align:start position:0%
thank you if I may also in part of
 
01:08:56.390 --> 01:08:56.400 align:start position:0%
respon response to your question Madam
 
01:08:58.950 --> 01:08:58.960 align:start position:0%
chair and with reference to um some of
 
01:09:00.430 --> 01:09:00.440 align:start position:0%
the very enlightening information that
 
01:09:02.709 --> 01:09:02.719 align:start position:0%
representative Morris has been giving us
 
01:09:05.789 --> 01:09:05.799 align:start position:0%
um if people have looked at you know
 
01:09:08.309 --> 01:09:08.319 align:start position:0%
3657 this goes down a little bit in
 
01:09:10.669 --> 01:09:10.679 align:start position:0%
terms of that notification process and
 
01:09:11.950 --> 01:09:11.960 align:start position:0%
then the work done by the regional
 
01:09:14.990 --> 01:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
planning boards that is already as is
 
01:09:16.590 --> 01:09:16.600 align:start position:0%
indicated even in this amendment's
 
01:09:18.149 --> 01:09:18.159 align:start position:0%
language right that's already part of
 
01:09:20.950 --> 01:09:20.960 align:start position:0%
law right so this is already something
 
01:09:23.390 --> 01:09:23.400 align:start position:0%
that is required by law it's done by our
 
01:09:24.870 --> 01:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
planning boards in this case we're
 
01:09:27.390 --> 01:09:27.400 align:start position:0%
making sure that the applicant um well
 
01:09:28.749 --> 01:09:28.759 align:start position:0%
actually that's already the cost that
 
01:09:30.510 --> 01:09:30.520 align:start position:0%
shall be borne by the applicant is is
 
01:09:33.269 --> 01:09:33.279 align:start position:0%
already there what we're adding to law
 
01:09:36.910 --> 01:09:36.920 align:start position:0%
proposing to add to law is uh notifying
 
01:09:38.470 --> 01:09:38.480 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State of another
 
01:09:41.349 --> 01:09:41.359 align:start position:0%
bordering state uh that was uh some
 
01:09:43.550 --> 01:09:43.560 align:start position:0%
discussion we had had before right about
 
01:09:45.149 --> 01:09:45.159 align:start position:0%
the difficulties potentially of knowing
 
01:09:46.749 --> 01:09:46.759 align:start position:0%
who to notify if it's out of state so
 
01:09:48.749 --> 01:09:48.759 align:start position:0%
this is just you send it to one place
 
01:09:50.510 --> 01:09:50.520 align:start position:0%
and then let them figure out how to how
 
01:09:54.669 --> 01:09:54.679 align:start position:0%
to notify uh but I think that your
 
01:09:56.229 --> 01:09:56.239 align:start position:0%
interpretation of the the previous
 
01:09:59.510 --> 01:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
section is correct it's it's the uh
 
01:10:01.590 --> 01:10:01.600 align:start position:0%
applicants job to provide the
 
01:10:03.709 --> 01:10:03.719 align:start position:0%
notification and then the process
 
01:10:05.830 --> 01:10:05.840 align:start position:0%
proceeds from there based on what's
 
01:10:08.510 --> 01:10:08.520 align:start position:0%
mostly already in law in 3657 thank you
 
01:10:08.520 --> 01:10:10.149 align:start position:0%
mostly already in law in 3657 thank you
representative

01:10:10.149 --> 01:10:10.159 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:10:13.149 --> 01:10:13.159 align:start position:0%
Penza so I just wanted to respond to
 
01:10:16.990 --> 01:10:17.000 align:start position:0%
representative Comas um because I I can
 
01:10:18.430 --> 01:10:18.440 align:start position:0%
understand this is you know there's a
 
01:10:19.790 --> 01:10:19.800 align:start position:0%
little bit of confusion but it's
 
01:10:22.149 --> 01:10:22.159 align:start position:0%
basically to me all of the stuff is
 
01:10:26.030 --> 01:10:26.040 align:start position:0%
already in statute and law and it's just
 
01:10:29.310 --> 01:10:29.320 align:start position:0%
um notifying just it's so let's say if
 
01:10:31.310 --> 01:10:31.320 align:start position:0%
it's currently they're notifying this
 
01:10:33.830 --> 01:10:33.840 align:start position:0%
it's going out to here that's it so it's
 
01:10:36.470 --> 01:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
just getting more voters informed and
 
01:10:39.110 --> 01:10:39.120 align:start position:0%
the reason why I support this is because
 
01:10:42.149 --> 01:10:42.159 align:start position:0%
of Rochester so and we have a landfill
 
01:10:44.870 --> 01:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
there and um and I'm going to be
 
01:10:48.590 --> 01:10:48.600 align:start position:0%
supportive of them expanding because um
 
01:10:51.310 --> 01:10:51.320 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's going to be necessary um
 
01:10:52.830 --> 01:10:52.840 align:start position:0%
and they're doing things the right way
 
01:10:55.750 --> 01:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
they're very good at notifying um but
 
01:10:58.310 --> 01:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
where they're located in Rochester right
 
01:11:02.510 --> 01:11:02.520 align:start position:0%
now in their abutters is is very narrow
 
01:11:04.149 --> 01:11:04.159 align:start position:0%
and you have to understand that
 
01:11:07.149 --> 01:11:07.159 align:start position:0%
literally a Stones Throw is do for them
 
01:11:09.990 --> 01:11:10.000 align:start position:0%
and so this really and then there's all
 
01:11:11.910 --> 01:11:11.920 align:start position:0%
barington and all the that that are
 
01:11:13.870 --> 01:11:13.880 align:start position:0%
really affected by this and I think
 
01:11:15.470 --> 01:11:15.480 align:start position:0%
everybody should know kind of what's
 
01:11:17.870 --> 01:11:17.880 align:start position:0%
Happening you know having a local
 
01:11:20.310 --> 01:11:20.320 align:start position:0%
election that I was working at um in Lee
 
01:11:23.189 --> 01:11:23.199 align:start position:0%
and Madbury and do W 4 uh over the past
 
01:11:26.189 --> 01:11:26.199 align:start position:0%
week um I can't tell you how many voters
 
01:11:28.430 --> 01:11:28.440 align:start position:0%
just don't know they don't know they're
 
01:11:30.229 --> 01:11:30.239 align:start position:0%
it's really hard and just a notice in
 
01:11:33.390 --> 01:11:33.400 align:start position:0%
the paper is hard so I think um sending
 
01:11:35.070 --> 01:11:35.080 align:start position:0%
out you know direct letters to people's
 
01:11:37.669 --> 01:11:37.679 align:start position:0%
homes I I don't think it's much to ask
 
01:11:40.310 --> 01:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
um I really I I like this bill okay
 
01:11:43.390 --> 01:11:43.400 align:start position:0%
represent kto thank you madam chair may
 
01:11:46.229 --> 01:11:46.239 align:start position:0%
ask representative Penza this would not
 
01:11:50.189 --> 01:11:50.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:53.669 --> 01:11:53.679 align:start position:0%
all if they're expanding it would not
 
01:11:55.910 --> 01:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
they're not that no it won't but they're
 
01:11:58.350 --> 01:11:58.360 align:start position:0%
still going to do the same thing that
 
01:12:00.430 --> 01:12:00.440 align:start position:0%
they already do which is in their
 
01:12:02.310 --> 01:12:02.320 align:start position:0%
Butters and all of that but I can tell
 
01:12:04.350 --> 01:12:04.360 align:start position:0%
you right now because of stuff that's
 
01:12:07.550 --> 01:12:07.560 align:start position:0%
going on in Rochester they are
 
01:12:10.550 --> 01:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
automatically um doing more Outreach I
 
01:12:13.510 --> 01:12:13.520 align:start position:0%
have to give them that um they want to
 
01:12:16.590 --> 01:12:16.600 align:start position:0%
really handle the concerns there's huge
 
01:12:20.070 --> 01:12:20.080 align:start position:0%
odor concerns that we have um this um
 
01:12:22.189 --> 01:12:22.199 align:start position:0%
the amount of of rain that we've had is
 
01:12:24.830 --> 01:12:24.840 align:start position:0%
really affecting their operations um
 
01:12:28.070 --> 01:12:28.080 align:start position:0%
they've a phenomenal job so um yes it
 
01:12:29.350 --> 01:12:29.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't affect them because they
 
01:12:30.830 --> 01:12:30.840 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have to they would be
 
01:12:34.149 --> 01:12:34.159 align:start position:0%
grandfathered in in a sense okay all
 
01:12:36.830 --> 01:12:36.840 align:start position:0%
right um one more representative Murray
 
01:12:39.709 --> 01:12:39.719 align:start position:0%
and then we should call the vote I think
 
01:12:42.189 --> 01:12:42.199 align:start position:0%
I to that point I think that with
 
01:12:45.030 --> 01:12:45.040 align:start position:0%
respect to um the am the amendment that
 
01:12:46.950 --> 01:12:46.960 align:start position:0%
was proposed I I want to make sure that
 
01:12:49.590 --> 01:12:49.600 align:start position:0%
we're to represent a potental point we
 
01:12:51.470 --> 01:12:51.480 align:start position:0%
are not
 
01:12:53.950 --> 01:12:53.960 align:start position:0%
um this is a service that is provided to
 
01:12:55.750 --> 01:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
our community to deal with the TR that
 
01:12:58.390 --> 01:12:58.400 align:start position:0%
our communities create right and so in
 
01:13:01.870 --> 01:13:01.880 align:start position:0%
doing so when we have to then think
 
01:13:04.550 --> 01:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
about impacts in our communities just
 
01:13:06.510 --> 01:13:06.520 align:start position:0%
like many other types of things that are
 
01:13:08.510 --> 01:13:08.520 align:start position:0%
Regional in nature a landfill is
 
01:13:10.510 --> 01:13:10.520 align:start position:0%
regional and so I think this makes
 
01:13:13.750 --> 01:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
pragmatic sense to move forward in that
 
01:13:18.550 --> 01:13:18.560 align:start position:0%
way all right so um I guess I'll have
 
01:13:21.030 --> 01:13:21.040 align:start position:0%

01:13:23.390 --> 01:13:23.400 align:start position:0%

talked about this amendment already in
 
01:14:42.990 --> 01:14:43.000 align:start position:0%
our discussion a previous discussion uh
 
01:14:47.229 --> 01:14:47.239 align:start position:0%
we really tried to uh take in questions
 
01:14:49.470 --> 01:14:49.480 align:start position:0%
and concerns that uh came up from
 
01:14:52.110 --> 01:14:52.120 align:start position:0%
members uh on both sides in our previous
 
01:14:55.229 --> 01:14:55.239 align:start position:0%
discussion uh and went back to Dees and
 
01:14:57.270 --> 01:14:57.280 align:start position:0%
and did things like making sure we had
 
01:14:59.990 --> 01:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
the right Watershed um I understand the
 
01:15:02.510 --> 01:15:02.520 align:start position:0%
10 miles there for some folks there's a
 
01:15:04.189 --> 01:15:04.199 align:start position:0%
question about what that is our sense
 
01:15:06.229 --> 01:15:06.239 align:start position:0%
was that anything less than that is
 
01:15:08.750 --> 01:15:08.760 align:start position:0%
simply not going to be uh sufficient and
 
01:15:10.709 --> 01:15:10.719 align:start position:0%
here we are talking about uh just
 
01:15:12.990 --> 01:15:13.000 align:start position:0%
letting uh informing communities within
 
01:15:15.590 --> 01:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
that range uh of these potential
 
01:15:17.550 --> 01:15:17.560 align:start position:0%
projects uh we also have the
 
01:15:19.350 --> 01:15:19.360 align:start position:0%
grandfathering Clause that was a
 
01:15:20.950 --> 01:15:20.960 align:start position:0%
response to some questions that were
 
01:15:25.189 --> 01:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
raised uh at that time so um I feel like
 
01:15:28.229 --> 01:15:28.239 align:start position:0%
we did a responsible job in coming up
 
01:15:30.470 --> 01:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
with a a compromise document I for one
 
01:15:32.229 --> 01:15:32.239 align:start position:0%
actually am not a fan of grandfathering
 
01:15:35.350 --> 01:15:35.360 align:start position:0%
in um existing sites I would say if if
 
01:15:37.669 --> 01:15:37.679 align:start position:0%
you have an an expansion that it should
 
01:15:39.830 --> 01:15:39.840 align:start position:0%
go through this process uh but again
 
01:15:41.470 --> 01:15:41.480 align:start position:0%
that's something we gave up on because
 
01:15:43.070 --> 01:15:43.080 align:start position:0%
we heard from members of the committee
 
01:15:45.030 --> 01:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
and wanted to put together an amendment
 
01:15:47.229 --> 01:15:47.239 align:start position:0%
that incorporated all of those concerns
 
01:15:51.030 --> 01:15:51.040 align:start position:0%
so uh that's all I have to say about it
 
01:15:53.910 --> 01:15:53.920 align:start position:0%
at this point so thank you any further
 
01:15:53.920 --> 01:15:56.669 align:start position:0%
at this point so thank you any further

late I okay so um we are going to uh
 
01:33:24.950 --> 01:33:24.960 align:start position:0%
open some discussion on hb1 1574 for uh
 
01:33:28.790 --> 01:33:28.800 align:start position:0%
bill that we heard last week um removing
 
01:33:30.669 --> 01:33:30.679 align:start position:0%
regulations on the direct sale of raw
 
01:33:33.270 --> 01:33:33.280 align:start position:0%
milk and consumers to
 
01:33:36.229 --> 01:33:36.239 align:start position:0%
Consumers um that's HB
 
01:33:38.910 --> 01:33:38.920 align:start position:0%
1574 and I open up any discussion from
 
01:33:41.830 --> 01:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
our committee regarding uh testimony and
 
01:33:44.030 --> 01:33:44.040 align:start position:0%
uh the bill in
 
01:33:46.910 --> 01:33:46.920 align:start position:0%
general representative kraton oh yes
 
01:33:49.990 --> 01:33:50.000 align:start position:0%
ma'am yeah sponsor did not show oh for
 
01:33:55.550 --> 01:33:55.560 align:start position:0%
the raw milk bill yeah Ah that's true
 
01:33:58.430 --> 01:33:58.440 align:start position:0%
and and the fign bureau was against it
 
01:34:03.830 --> 01:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
and dhss was against it and so that to
 
01:34:06.430 --> 01:34:06.440 align:start position:0%
me was sort of compelling yeah
 
01:34:10.070 --> 01:34:10.080 align:start position:0%
representative Duty uh yes I mean we
 
01:34:12.709 --> 01:34:12.719 align:start position:0%
just had a bill similar to this uh I
 
01:34:15.229 --> 01:34:15.239 align:start position:0%
believe it was last session and we had
 
01:34:17.310 --> 01:34:17.320 align:start position:0%
talked about I think we had raised it at
 
01:34:19.350 --> 01:34:19.360 align:start position:0%
that point to 20 gallons I'm not sure
 
01:34:21.430 --> 01:34:21.440 align:start position:0%
perhaps one of the other Representatives
 
01:34:24.590 --> 01:34:24.600 align:start position:0%
has a better re recall than I do but I
 
01:34:27.070 --> 01:34:27.080 align:start position:0%
would be adverse to making another
 
01:34:30.229 --> 01:34:30.239 align:start position:0%
change to this representative Kaman did
 
01:34:33.390 --> 01:34:33.400 align:start position:0%
you I thought okay yeah um I think you
 
01:34:35.950 --> 01:34:35.960 align:start position:0%
know we've kind of discussed raw milk to
 
01:34:38.390 --> 01:34:38.400 align:start position:0%
death the past two years three years
 
01:34:42.109 --> 01:34:42.119 align:start position:0%
four years um and I think that the the
 
01:34:44.830 --> 01:34:44.840 align:start position:0%
changes that we made to statute at that
 
01:34:49.109 --> 01:34:49.119 align:start position:0%
time were uh reasonable un workable um
 
01:34:52.669 --> 01:34:52.679 align:start position:0%
we're still we're still seeing the
 
01:34:54.430 --> 01:34:54.440 align:start position:0%
results of that
 
01:34:56.109 --> 01:34:56.119 align:start position:0%
and I think
 
01:35:00.430 --> 01:35:00.440 align:start position:0%
um I I I I don't see any real reason to
 
01:35:05.870 --> 01:35:05.880 align:start position:0%
pursue any further uh expansion of uh
 
01:35:09.709 --> 01:35:09.719 align:start position:0%
the production or sale of raw milk and
 
01:35:11.750 --> 01:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
so I would be itl on this bill
 
01:35:14.470 --> 01:35:14.480 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby so uh at the
 
01:35:19.470 --> 01:35:19.480 align:start position:0%
hearing uh last week I um we were on the
 
01:35:21.629 --> 01:35:21.639 align:start position:0%
verge of saying should we exec this
 
01:35:25.830 --> 01:35:25.840 align:start position:0%
right now itl and I and I said no
 
01:35:27.310 --> 01:35:27.320 align:start position:0%
because we have a couple of people on
 
01:35:29.550 --> 01:35:29.560 align:start position:0%
the committee who might want to voice
 
01:35:31.910 --> 01:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
some other opinion but those people are
 
01:35:34.590 --> 01:35:34.600 align:start position:0%
not here today so I think that uh we
 
01:35:36.149 --> 01:35:36.159 align:start position:0%
know what to do with this
 
01:35:36.159 --> 01:35:38.669 align:start position:0%
know what to do with this
bill

01:35:38.669 --> 01:35:38.679 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:35:41.629 --> 01:35:41.639 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative ktoa thank you
 
01:35:44.629 --> 01:35:44.639 align:start position:0%
madam chair um the prime sponsor
 
01:35:46.629 --> 01:35:46.639 align:start position:0%
apologizes for not being here he did
 
01:35:49.990 --> 01:35:50.000 align:start position:0%
reach out to me um and he understands
 
01:35:54.229 --> 01:35:54.239 align:start position:0%
that the bill as written is is a no-o
 
01:35:56.750 --> 01:35:56.760 align:start position:0%
um I explained to him especially where
 
01:36:00.430 --> 01:36:00.440 align:start position:0%
in regards to the ice cream
 
01:36:04.070 --> 01:36:04.080 align:start position:0%
um that that container size is there for
 
01:36:07.669 --> 01:36:07.679 align:start position:0%
a very specific reason um and it's
 
01:36:09.790 --> 01:36:09.800 align:start position:0%
extremely important that we keep that
 
01:36:12.310 --> 01:36:12.320 align:start position:0%
size and statute but he did ask if we
 
01:36:14.070 --> 01:36:14.080 align:start position:0%
could make a modest increase to the
 
01:36:16.870 --> 01:36:16.880 align:start position:0%
gallons of say like f an increase from
 
01:36:19.510 --> 01:36:19.520 align:start position:0%
20 gallons to 25 gallons so I'm just
 
01:36:22.550 --> 01:36:22.560 align:start position:0%
going to put that out there for the
 
01:36:22.560 --> 01:36:24.149 align:start position:0%
going to put that out there for the
committee

01:36:24.149 --> 01:36:24.159 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:36:28.189 --> 01:36:28.199 align:start position:0%
okay any other comments on
 
01:36:31.910 --> 01:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
this all right well I guess um uh we we
 
01:36:34.669 --> 01:36:34.679 align:start position:0%
will be uh executing this bill next week
 
01:36:37.550 --> 01:36:37.560 align:start position:0%
along with several others and uh I guess
 
01:36:41.629 --> 01:36:41.639 align:start position:0%
we'll move on to discussions on uh
 
01:36:44.550 --> 01:36:44.560 align:start position:0%
hp504 relative to architectural paint
 
01:36:46.950 --> 01:36:46.960 align:start position:0%
recycling and I will give the floor to
 
01:36:49.510 --> 01:36:49.520 align:start position:0%
representative Murray who will uh update
 
01:36:51.709 --> 01:36:51.719 align:start position:0%
us on what her sub subcommittee has been
 
01:36:54.709 --> 01:36:54.719 align:start position:0%
working on and uh any other comments she
 
01:36:58.510 --> 01:36:58.520 align:start position:0%
has uh on on this bill uh thank you
 
01:37:00.590 --> 01:37:00.600 align:start position:0%
madam chair um since the last we met um
 
01:37:02.910 --> 01:37:02.920 align:start position:0%
you had just asked for an update um on
 
01:37:04.149 --> 01:37:04.159 align:start position:0%
some things and so this is an
 
01:37:06.550 --> 01:37:06.560 align:start position:0%
opportunity for the full sub um full
 
01:37:09.229 --> 01:37:09.239 align:start position:0%
committee to also work on this together
 
01:37:11.669 --> 01:37:11.679 align:start position:0%
I've given you a copy of potential um
 
01:37:13.709 --> 01:37:13.719 align:start position:0%
thoughts and language around the
 
01:37:16.709 --> 01:37:16.719 align:start position:0%
structure of the bill um we had heard
 
01:37:21.109 --> 01:37:21.119 align:start position:0%
from the Department um at uh last week
 
01:37:25.510 --> 01:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
sometime oh I'm sorry did you oh sorry
 
01:37:29.390 --> 01:37:29.400 align:start position:0%
sorry um about some concerns that they
 
01:37:32.510 --> 01:37:32.520 align:start position:0%
had had around um paint being classified
 
01:37:34.030 --> 01:37:34.040 align:start position:0%
when you're at the regular big box
 
01:37:36.189 --> 01:37:36.199 align:start position:0%
retailer as hazardous waste and the
 
01:37:38.790 --> 01:37:38.800 align:start position:0%
potential of when it would be um
 
01:37:40.990 --> 01:37:41.000 align:start position:0%
returned to either a collection site
 
01:37:42.750 --> 01:37:42.760 align:start position:0%
whether it's a a political subdivision
 
01:37:44.589 --> 01:37:44.599 align:start position:0%
like a transport station or some other
 
01:37:47.910 --> 01:37:47.920 align:start position:0%
municipally run collection site um it
 
01:37:49.669 --> 01:37:49.679 align:start position:0%
would be still considered hazardous
 
01:37:51.270 --> 01:37:51.280 align:start position:0%
waste so there was some conversation
 
01:37:52.870 --> 01:37:52.880 align:start position:0%
about um making sure that there was a
 
01:37:55.310 --> 01:37:55.320 align:start position:0%
provision for what is called Universal
 
01:37:58.350 --> 01:37:58.360 align:start position:0%
waste and um that is something that I
 
01:38:02.270 --> 01:38:02.280 align:start position:0%
did include in sort of my my thoughts in
 
01:38:06.310 --> 01:38:06.320 align:start position:0%
the sort of um drafting of the document
 
01:38:10.030 --> 01:38:10.040 align:start position:0%
and I apologize for there not being um
 
01:38:14.589 --> 01:38:14.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:17.629 --> 01:38:17.639 align:start position:0%
page we're double-sided here one two
 
01:38:20.270 --> 01:38:20.280 align:start position:0%
three four five six it would be seven so
 
01:38:23.270 --> 01:38:23.280 align:start position:0%
the last page of the stapled paperwork
 
01:38:25.470 --> 01:38:25.480 align:start position:0%
um there's a Ru making procedure and the
 
01:38:27.470 --> 01:38:27.480 align:start position:0%
department um May adopt rules or
 
01:38:29.030 --> 01:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
procedures to implement the requirements
 
01:38:31.109 --> 01:38:31.119 align:start position:0%
of the the subdivision or chapter
 
01:38:33.669 --> 01:38:33.679 align:start position:0%
Universe W uh waste designation for
 
01:38:34.950 --> 01:38:34.960 align:start position:0%
postc Consumer
 
01:38:38.030 --> 01:38:38.040 align:start position:0%
paint um and that would just have a
 
01:38:41.270 --> 01:38:41.280 align:start position:0%
clear defined role for how the paint is
 
01:38:43.270 --> 01:38:43.280 align:start position:0%
considered one of the things that it
 
01:38:45.669 --> 01:38:45.679 align:start position:0%
would also require in this sort of
 
01:38:48.149 --> 01:38:48.159 align:start position:0%
chapter of universal waste is that they
 
01:38:50.870 --> 01:38:50.880 align:start position:0%
are clearly labeled I sort of I very
 
01:38:52.790 --> 01:38:52.800 align:start position:0%
boldly um highlighted for our
 
01:38:55.430 --> 01:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
subcommittees consideration today a
 
01:38:57.430 --> 01:38:57.440 align:start position:0%
statement that says under sub paragraph
 
01:38:59.550 --> 01:38:59.560 align:start position:0%
C that containers holding postc consumer
 
01:39:02.030 --> 01:39:02.040 align:start position:0%
paint that is regulated as universal
 
01:39:03.669 --> 01:39:03.679 align:start position:0%
waste shall be clearly labeled as
 
01:39:05.589 --> 01:39:05.599 align:start position:0%
universal waste paint used paint or
 
01:39:08.669 --> 01:39:08.679 align:start position:0%
waste paint and that is something that
 
01:39:11.550 --> 01:39:11.560 align:start position:0%
um I think um the department had just
 
01:39:13.870 --> 01:39:13.880 align:start position:0%
briefly touched on but I don't know are
 
01:39:15.910 --> 01:39:15.920 align:start position:0%
they available to come up and provide
 
01:39:18.830 --> 01:39:18.840 align:start position:0%
conversation during this sub committee
 
01:39:21.270 --> 01:39:21.280 align:start position:0%
um during a work session yeah they would
 
01:39:24.669 --> 01:39:24.679 align:start position:0%
be' be happy to have comment on it and
 
01:39:26.229 --> 01:39:26.239 align:start position:0%
that was just yeah that was just the one
 
01:39:28.229 --> 01:39:28.239 align:start position:0%
thing that I I wanted you to explain a
 
01:39:29.870 --> 01:39:29.880 align:start position:0%
little bit more about your desires of
 
01:39:33.589 --> 01:39:33.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:36.149 --> 01:39:36.159 align:start position:0%
waste I want to remind everyone please
 
01:39:38.189 --> 01:39:38.199 align:start position:0%
to um when you're speaking to make sure
 
01:39:40.990 --> 01:39:41.000 align:start position:0%
your microphone is on uh I've had an
 
01:39:43.030 --> 01:39:43.040 align:start position:0%
email from someone saying that they are
 
01:39:46.270 --> 01:39:46.280 align:start position:0%
listening in and uh we are not always
 
01:39:50.030 --> 01:39:50.040 align:start position:0%
putting our microphones on so just just
 
01:39:52.950 --> 01:39:52.960 align:start position:0%
that go right ahead and hi Todd pisit
 
01:39:54.310 --> 01:39:54.320 align:start position:0%
with the new New Hampshire Department of
 
01:39:55.910 --> 01:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services and with the
 
01:39:58.070 --> 01:39:58.080 align:start position:0%
Hazardous Waste Management Bureau and I
 
01:40:00.790 --> 01:40:00.800 align:start position:0%
did have concerns oilbased paint in New
 
01:40:03.350 --> 01:40:03.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is is classified as hazardous
 
01:40:05.149 --> 01:40:05.159 align:start position:0%
waste solvent-based paints also are
 
01:40:08.629 --> 01:40:08.639 align:start position:0%
classified as hazardous waste um when a
 
01:40:10.709 --> 01:40:10.719 align:start position:0%
homeowner has these things household
 
01:40:13.350 --> 01:40:13.360 align:start position:0%
hazardous waste is exempt from that
 
01:40:15.189 --> 01:40:15.199 align:start position:0%
however as soon as it's collected by
 
01:40:18.109 --> 01:40:18.119 align:start position:0%
another entity it then must it then
 
01:40:19.870 --> 01:40:19.880 align:start position:0%
becomes hazardous waste and has to be
 
01:40:23.350 --> 01:40:23.360 align:start position:0%
handled as as such other states have
 
01:40:26.510 --> 01:40:26.520 align:start position:0%
have designated oilbased paints as
 
01:40:28.310 --> 01:40:28.320 align:start position:0%
universal waste which is something we
 
01:40:30.589 --> 01:40:30.599 align:start position:0%
have the ability to do in New Hampshire
 
01:40:33.910 --> 01:40:33.920 align:start position:0%
Universal waste is still uh a type of
 
01:40:35.629 --> 01:40:35.639 align:start position:0%
hazardous waste but there are far less
 
01:40:38.589 --> 01:40:38.599 align:start position:0%
strict requirements on how it's managed
 
01:40:41.430 --> 01:40:41.440 align:start position:0%
and an entity that only collects
 
01:40:43.550 --> 01:40:43.560 align:start position:0%
Universal waste would not necessarily be
 
01:40:46.070 --> 01:40:46.080 align:start position:0%
a hazardous waste generator whereas if
 
01:40:49.030 --> 01:40:49.040 align:start position:0%
you took in this oilbased paint and it
 
01:40:51.589 --> 01:40:51.599 align:start position:0%
wasn't classified as universal waste
 
01:40:53.350 --> 01:40:53.360 align:start position:0%
that entity that took it in an AC
 
01:40:55.189 --> 01:40:55.199 align:start position:0%
Hardware or something like that would
 
01:40:57.870 --> 01:40:57.880 align:start position:0%
become a hazardous waste generator would
 
01:40:59.950 --> 01:40:59.960 align:start position:0%
have to notify would have to follow all
 
01:41:01.470 --> 01:41:01.480 align:start position:0%
the rules within the Hazardous Waste
 
01:41:03.990 --> 01:41:04.000 align:start position:0%
rules so making it a universal waste
 
01:41:07.149 --> 01:41:07.159 align:start position:0%
would help with that um there are still
 
01:41:09.350 --> 01:41:09.360 align:start position:0%
concerns as far as hazardous waste is
 
01:41:13.229 --> 01:41:13.239 align:start position:0%
concerned because uh it it seems
 
01:41:17.149 --> 01:41:17.159 align:start position:0%
that occasionally nonprogrammed
 
01:41:20.589 --> 01:41:20.599 align:start position:0%
materials get brought to these locations
 
01:41:22.870 --> 01:41:22.880 align:start position:0%
so if something like paint thinner which
 
01:41:26.510 --> 01:41:26.520 align:start position:0%
isn't part of the program gets collected
 
01:41:29.189 --> 01:41:29.199 align:start position:0%
that that's hazardous waste and becomes
 
01:41:31.390 --> 01:41:31.400 align:start position:0%
hazardous waste so it's it's unclear how
 
01:41:33.990 --> 01:41:34.000 align:start position:0%
that would be managed but by designated
 
01:41:35.750 --> 01:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
designated oilbased and Sol
 
01:41:38.510 --> 01:41:38.520 align:start position:0%
solvent-based paints as universal waste
 
01:41:42.149 --> 01:41:42.159 align:start position:0%
would would go a long way to making that
 
01:41:45.910 --> 01:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
sort of go away that that concern okay
 
01:41:47.669 --> 01:41:47.679 align:start position:0%
and is that's something that can be
 
01:41:50.510 --> 01:41:50.520 align:start position:0%
accommodated in in any amendment to this
 
01:41:52.830 --> 01:41:52.840 align:start position:0%
Bill yes and I I am also working with
 
01:41:55.149 --> 01:41:55.159 align:start position:0%
some other stakeholders about that
 
01:41:57.350 --> 01:41:57.360 align:start position:0%
specific sort of concern that the
 
01:41:59.310 --> 01:41:59.320 align:start position:0%
department was mentioning around like
 
01:42:01.270 --> 01:42:01.280 align:start position:0%
all other solvents what to do with those
 
01:42:02.910 --> 01:42:02.920 align:start position:0%
in the in the circumstance where that
 
01:42:06.229 --> 01:42:06.239 align:start position:0%
happens yes so okay um and if I may um
 
01:42:08.070 --> 01:42:08.080 align:start position:0%
sure go right ahead one of the other
 
01:42:10.990 --> 01:42:11.000 align:start position:0%
things that um I had taken a look at the
 
01:42:13.189 --> 01:42:13.199 align:start position:0%
fee structures associated with other
 
01:42:15.589 --> 01:42:15.599 align:start position:0%
states and if you look at the paint here
 
01:42:17.030 --> 01:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
um sheet that you have that's a
 
01:42:19.310 --> 01:42:19.320 align:start position:0%
double-sided one dated January
 
01:42:22.189 --> 01:42:22.199 align:start position:0%
2024 it does look like there were some
 
01:42:24.629 --> 01:42:24.639 align:start position:0%
updates made to structures in the state
 
01:42:29.510 --> 01:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
of Vermont to keep up with um the
 
01:42:32.109 --> 01:42:32.119 align:start position:0%
ability to manage the program and then
 
01:42:35.350 --> 01:42:35.360 align:start position:0%
also um there were structures with uh
 
01:42:37.310 --> 01:42:37.320 align:start position:0%
respect to those smaller than one gallon
 
01:42:41.510 --> 01:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
one to two gallons and up to uh um up to
 
01:42:43.990 --> 01:42:44.000 align:start position:0%
five gallon buckets so the fee structure
 
01:42:46.750 --> 01:42:46.760 align:start position:0%
went from I believe it was initially
 
01:42:50.390 --> 01:42:50.400 align:start position:0%
$1.99 through uh April of 2024 so we
 
01:42:52.629 --> 01:42:52.639 align:start position:0%
haven't crushed that well Vermont has
 
01:42:54.750 --> 01:42:54.760 align:start position:0%
not crushed that threshold yet and they
 
01:42:57.149 --> 01:42:57.159 align:start position:0%
are slated to then adjust them beginning
 
01:42:59.510 --> 01:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
May one um to
 
01:43:03.189 --> 01:43:03.199 align:start position:0%
$245 and a do35 for one to two gallons
 
01:43:07.109 --> 01:43:07.119 align:start position:0%
and 65 cents um for less than one gallon
 
01:43:10.950 --> 01:43:10.960 align:start position:0%
of paint so um one of the other types
 
01:43:12.070 --> 01:43:12.080 align:start position:0%
one of the other things and being
 
01:43:13.709 --> 01:43:13.719 align:start position:0%
careful that we were not putting an
 
01:43:16.229 --> 01:43:16.239 align:start position:0%
undue burden on the department was to
 
01:43:17.950 --> 01:43:17.960 align:start position:0%
ensure that there was the potential to
 
01:43:20.870 --> 01:43:20.880 align:start position:0%
have a portion of the fees go to the
 
01:43:23.310 --> 01:43:23.320 align:start position:0%
department and so on the very last last
 
01:43:25.990 --> 01:43:26.000 align:start position:0%
page on the rear side I had 15 to 30
 
01:43:27.709 --> 01:43:27.719 align:start position:0%
cents of each fee going to the
 
01:43:30.310 --> 01:43:30.320 align:start position:0%
department for ongoing review oversight
 
01:43:32.750 --> 01:43:32.760 align:start position:0%
management of the program on an annual
 
01:43:34.870 --> 01:43:34.880 align:start position:0%
basis I don't know if that's the right
 
01:43:37.070 --> 01:43:37.080 align:start position:0%
number yet I that is just something that
 
01:43:39.830 --> 01:43:39.840 align:start position:0%
I had started off uh looking at sort of
 
01:43:41.870 --> 01:43:41.880 align:start position:0%
if we had collected a 100,000 gallons of
 
01:43:44.310 --> 01:43:44.320 align:start position:0%
paint within the state annually based on
 
01:43:46.390 --> 01:43:46.400 align:start position:0%
sort of the averages of the data we saw
 
01:43:49.070 --> 01:43:49.080 align:start position:0%
previously among similarly sized States
 
01:43:53.430 --> 01:43:53.440 align:start position:0%
like Rhode Island Vermont Maine um if
 
01:43:55.390 --> 01:43:55.400 align:start position:0%
you know what what that number looked
 
01:43:57.510 --> 01:43:57.520 align:start position:0%
like so I want to be more careful in
 
01:44:00.390 --> 01:44:00.400 align:start position:0%
thinking about you know that what is it
 
01:44:03.790 --> 01:44:03.800 align:start position:0%
25 cents is it 50 cents is it what is
 
01:44:06.070 --> 01:44:06.080 align:start position:0%
that what is that number that would be
 
01:44:08.510 --> 01:44:08.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate do we know if other states
 
01:44:11.430 --> 01:44:11.440 align:start position:0%
use a portion of their fee for for the
 
01:44:14.589 --> 01:44:14.599 align:start position:0%
similar support of their Environmental
 
01:44:17.310 --> 01:44:17.320 align:start position:0%
Services Division that deals with it I
 
01:44:19.070 --> 01:44:19.080 align:start position:0%
don't know that's a great question I can
 
01:44:20.430 --> 01:44:20.440 align:start position:0%
certainly look at that I think
 
01:44:23.870 --> 01:44:23.880 align:start position:0%
representative Duty so and then
 
01:44:26.589 --> 01:44:26.599 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah I'm I I can't answer that
 
01:44:28.629 --> 01:44:28.639 align:start position:0%
directly but it was my understanding
 
01:44:31.870 --> 01:44:31.880 align:start position:0%
that the way paint care works is that
 
01:44:36.629 --> 01:44:36.639 align:start position:0%
they handle all of the um the the fees
 
01:44:39.790 --> 01:44:39.800 align:start position:0%
um in in the process and that any work
 
01:44:42.709 --> 01:44:42.719 align:start position:0%
that is to be done by Dees oversight
 
01:44:46.149 --> 01:44:46.159 align:start position:0%
reviewing plans that they actually pay
 
01:44:49.109 --> 01:44:49.119 align:start position:0%
um the department for um the services
 
01:44:52.270 --> 01:44:52.280 align:start position:0%
that they provide so that that was my
 
01:44:53.830 --> 01:44:53.840 align:start position:0%
understanding when and I was more
 
01:44:55.350 --> 01:44:55.360 align:start position:0%
involved in this you know just a couple
 
01:44:58.390 --> 01:44:58.400 align:start position:0%
of months ago so um I think that's one
 
01:45:01.310 --> 01:45:01.320 align:start position:0%
thing we might want to check out okay so
 
01:45:04.550 --> 01:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
so walk me through the process of how
 
01:45:04.560 --> 01:45:06.310 align:start position:0%
so walk me through the process of how
this

01:45:06.310 --> 01:45:06.320 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:45:09.790 --> 01:45:09.800 align:start position:0%
works oh okay I'm sorry I would just
 
01:45:12.189 --> 01:45:12.199 align:start position:0%
reiterate what representative Duty says
 
01:45:13.990 --> 01:45:14.000 align:start position:0%
I believe I don't have the statute in
 
01:45:16.709 --> 01:45:16.719 align:start position:0%
front of me but new Vermont's statute at
 
01:45:20.830 --> 01:45:20.840 align:start position:0%
the very end has uh um a fee that paint
 
01:45:23.189 --> 01:45:23.199 align:start position:0%
care would pay to the Department to
 
01:45:25.669 --> 01:45:25.679 align:start position:0%
cover their costs
 
01:45:27.990 --> 01:45:28.000 align:start position:0%
okay may I did look at that fee
 
01:45:30.430 --> 01:45:30.440 align:start position:0%
structure it's enumerated in their rules
 
01:45:33.669 --> 01:45:33.679 align:start position:0%
subdivision it's not in statute from my
 
01:45:36.070 --> 01:45:36.080 align:start position:0%
understanding so I have to and I let me
 
01:45:38.709 --> 01:45:38.719 align:start position:0%
just I don't mean to let me double check
 
01:45:40.310 --> 01:45:40.320 align:start position:0%
because I was I was looking at both
 
01:45:42.109 --> 01:45:42.119 align:start position:0%
Maine and Vermont and I think it was
 
01:45:43.550 --> 01:45:43.560 align:start position:0%
enumerated in
 
01:45:46.350 --> 01:45:46.360 align:start position:0%
rules but it may be but I spoke with
 
01:45:47.990 --> 01:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
Vermont and I don't think they made
 
01:45:50.470 --> 01:45:50.480 align:start position:0%
rules I think they just went they just
 
01:45:52.109 --> 01:45:52.119 align:start position:0%
stuck with a statute but like I said I
 
01:45:54.270 --> 01:45:54.280 align:start position:0%
don't have the statute okay
 
01:45:58.470 --> 01:45:58.480 align:start position:0%
so okay yeah so walk me through what
 
01:46:00.790 --> 01:46:00.800 align:start position:0%
happens somebody goes into a paint store
 
01:46:04.350 --> 01:46:04.360 align:start position:0%
buys some paint and so when they check
 
01:46:07.149 --> 01:46:07.159 align:start position:0%
out whether the the this is what we were
 
01:46:08.709 --> 01:46:08.719 align:start position:0%
talking about representative Duty and I
 
01:46:10.310 --> 01:46:10.320 align:start position:0%
were debating whether or not the fee is
 
01:46:12.109 --> 01:46:12.119 align:start position:0%
already baked in if you will to the
 
01:46:15.229 --> 01:46:15.239 align:start position:0%
actual cost of the paint and in some
 
01:46:17.390 --> 01:46:17.400 align:start position:0%
circumstances that's the case and there
 
01:46:19.910 --> 01:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
are other states who had an added user
 
01:46:23.109 --> 01:46:23.119 align:start position:0%
fee on at the end at the check check te
 
01:46:25.990 --> 01:46:26.000 align:start position:0%
sand so like for example in places where
 
01:46:28.030 --> 01:46:28.040 align:start position:0%
you buy milk and you have a glass
 
01:46:31.470 --> 01:46:31.480 align:start position:0%
container deposit that is M charged um
 
01:46:33.189 --> 01:46:33.199 align:start position:0%
those types of fees are there as well so
 
01:46:36.750 --> 01:46:36.760 align:start position:0%
there were two models that have have
 
01:46:39.910 --> 01:46:39.920 align:start position:0%
that but most of the paint care models
 
01:46:41.910 --> 01:46:41.920 align:start position:0%
have it already sort of in the back end
 
01:46:44.669 --> 01:46:44.679 align:start position:0%
of the program like worked into the
 
01:46:47.669 --> 01:46:47.679 align:start position:0%
structure and that is then
 
01:46:49.950 --> 01:46:49.960 align:start position:0%
withheld okay representative
 
01:46:52.229 --> 01:46:52.239 align:start position:0%
comtable thank you madam chair and uh
 
01:46:54.030 --> 01:46:54.040 align:start position:0%
thank you repres Murray for working on
 
01:46:54.040 --> 01:46:55.510 align:start position:0%
thank you repres Murray for working on
this

01:46:55.510 --> 01:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:47:00.070 --> 01:47:00.080 align:start position:0%
um so how will this affect retailers
 
01:47:02.510 --> 01:47:02.520 align:start position:0%
regarding paperwor and getting the
 
01:47:02.520 --> 01:47:04.109 align:start position:0%
regarding paperwor and getting the
Monies

01:47:04.109 --> 01:47:04.119 align:start position:0%
Monies
 
01:47:07.310 --> 01:47:07.320 align:start position:0%
to where they need to go so is this like
 
01:47:10.229 --> 01:47:10.239 align:start position:0%
another step like um you know we have R
 
01:47:12.149 --> 01:47:12.159 align:start position:0%
rooms and males tax right so you have to
 
01:47:13.990 --> 01:47:14.000 align:start position:0%
separate that out and you have to file a
 
01:47:19.030 --> 01:47:19.040 align:start position:0%
report what would this what kind of
 
01:47:22.550 --> 01:47:22.560 align:start position:0%
uh added paperwork would this do add on
 
01:47:26.030 --> 01:47:26.040 align:start position:0%
to businesses I guess my question I
 
01:47:27.629 --> 01:47:27.639 align:start position:0%
think that that's exactly why paint care
 
01:47:30.109 --> 01:47:30.119 align:start position:0%
manages and oversees it that information
 
01:47:32.550 --> 01:47:32.560 align:start position:0%
then goes through paint Care's program
 
01:47:34.350 --> 01:47:34.360 align:start position:0%
and paint care then distributes that
 
01:47:36.750 --> 01:47:36.760 align:start position:0%
information and data uh in conjunction
 
01:47:39.510 --> 01:47:39.520 align:start position:0%
with uh the department and that's why
 
01:47:42.310 --> 01:47:42.320 align:start position:0%
that that fee for the Department to then
 
01:47:44.070 --> 01:47:44.080 align:start position:0%
look at those things there's a whole
 
01:47:46.430 --> 01:47:46.440 align:start position:0%
bunch of antitrust sort of conversations
 
01:47:48.270 --> 01:47:48.280 align:start position:0%
in here as well because there is monies
 
01:47:50.390 --> 01:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
being collected there has to be a
 
01:47:52.229 --> 01:47:52.239 align:start position:0%
requirement in here to make sure that
 
01:47:54.950 --> 01:47:54.960 align:start position:0%
there are there's a thirdparty verifier
 
01:47:58.070 --> 01:47:58.080 align:start position:0%
of the program um to look at that fee
 
01:47:59.790 --> 01:47:59.800 align:start position:0%
structure when you're dealing with money
 
01:48:03.990 --> 01:48:04.000 align:start position:0%
um that is listed inside of what I'm
 
01:48:08.030 --> 01:48:08.040 align:start position:0%
proposing representative dsy uh yes I I
 
01:48:09.709 --> 01:48:09.719 align:start position:0%
think the way I mean it's it's all
 
01:48:11.709 --> 01:48:11.719 align:start position:0%
automated so for example I mean every
 
01:48:14.109 --> 01:48:14.119 align:start position:0%
time you go to the store and they scan
 
01:48:15.910 --> 01:48:15.920 align:start position:0%
what you're buying I mean all that gets
 
01:48:19.070 --> 01:48:19.080 align:start position:0%
computed and it gets into um gets into a
 
01:48:21.669 --> 01:48:21.679 align:start position:0%
report so I mean I would assume that the
 
01:48:24.430 --> 01:48:24.440 align:start position:0%
retailers Maybe on a monthly basis would
 
01:48:26.870 --> 01:48:26.880 align:start position:0%
generate a report to paint care saying
 
01:48:31.189 --> 01:48:31.199 align:start position:0%
we sold 100 you know 100 gallons of XYZ
 
01:48:34.470 --> 01:48:34.480 align:start position:0%
uh you know uh 20 pints of XYZ and then
 
01:48:36.790 --> 01:48:36.800 align:start position:0%
based on that and based on what the fees
 
01:48:39.550 --> 01:48:39.560 align:start position:0%
are it it's just calculated out so I
 
01:48:41.550 --> 01:48:41.560 align:start position:0%
mean I think it's already part of their
 
01:48:44.270 --> 01:48:44.280 align:start position:0%
inventory control systems that are
 
01:48:47.030 --> 01:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
automated so then on the other end when
 
01:48:48.470 --> 01:48:48.480 align:start position:0%
you're finished with your painting
 
01:48:50.070 --> 01:48:50.080 align:start position:0%
project and you have half a gallon of
 
01:48:53.070 --> 01:48:53.080 align:start position:0%
paint left over you bring it back to the
 
01:48:55.390 --> 01:48:55.400 align:start position:0%
retailer you purchased it from is that
 
01:48:57.350 --> 01:48:57.360 align:start position:0%
what I'm hearing you can do that or
 
01:48:59.270 --> 01:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
there can be um collection sites
 
01:49:01.070 --> 01:49:01.080 align:start position:0%
established at places like transfer
 
01:49:04.149 --> 01:49:04.159 align:start position:0%
stations so there could be an either or
 
01:49:04.159 --> 01:49:06.310 align:start position:0%
stations so there could be an either or
okay

01:49:06.310 --> 01:49:06.320 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:49:10.550 --> 01:49:10.560 align:start position:0%
so then you you go and you drop off your
 
01:49:12.270 --> 01:49:12.280 align:start position:0%
paint but you're not getting any money
 
01:49:14.390 --> 01:49:14.400 align:start position:0%
back for it at all nothing you're just
 
01:49:16.750 --> 01:49:16.760 align:start position:0%
you're just disposing of it there
 
01:49:18.629 --> 01:49:18.639 align:start position:0%
instead of throwing it in your own trash
 
01:49:21.390 --> 01:49:21.400 align:start position:0%
with the kitty litter or whatever and so
 
01:49:24.709 --> 01:49:24.719 align:start position:0%
then they the retailer then works it out
 
01:49:26.950 --> 01:49:26.960 align:start position:0%
with paint cares
 
01:49:30.350 --> 01:49:30.360 align:start position:0%
to quote unquote recycle the paint right
 
01:49:32.030 --> 01:49:32.040 align:start position:0%
and there are there's a little bit more
 
01:49:33.589 --> 01:49:33.599 align:start position:0%
information on the front and the back of
 
01:49:35.870 --> 01:49:35.880 align:start position:0%
the different um structures that paint
 
01:49:38.189 --> 01:49:38.199 align:start position:0%
care has on this this one pager so to
 
01:49:41.790 --> 01:49:41.800 align:start position:0%
speak um of what their sort of business
 
01:49:44.070 --> 01:49:44.080 align:start position:0%
what their model is for the program um
 
01:49:46.470 --> 01:49:46.480 align:start position:0%
for businesses to be able to to plug
 
01:49:48.950 --> 01:49:48.960 align:start position:0%
into this for contractors to be able to
 
01:49:50.709 --> 01:49:50.719 align:start position:0%
make sure that they're working on
 
01:49:52.830 --> 01:49:52.840 align:start position:0%
including this in their estimate so that
 
01:49:54.470 --> 01:49:54.480 align:start position:0%
they're not losing Revenue either like
 
01:49:55.750 --> 01:49:55.760 align:start position:0%
if there's somebody painting someone's
 
01:49:57.910 --> 01:49:57.920 align:start position:0%
home how are they then adjusting for
 
01:49:59.430 --> 01:49:59.440 align:start position:0%
this as well so there's all sorts of
 
01:50:02.629 --> 01:50:02.639 align:start position:0%
things in here um as far as educational
 
01:50:05.709 --> 01:50:05.719 align:start position:0%
materials to uh retailers and
 
01:50:08.510 --> 01:50:08.520 align:start position:0%
contractors do all retailers have to
 
01:50:10.589 --> 01:50:10.599 align:start position:0%
participate in this the way this is
 
01:50:13.470 --> 01:50:13.480 align:start position:0%
currently written it does say shall but
 
01:50:17.070 --> 01:50:17.080 align:start position:0%
I I that is why I opened the discussion
 
01:50:21.830 --> 01:50:21.840 align:start position:0%
up to um having the ability for smaller
 
01:50:24.109 --> 01:50:24.119 align:start position:0%
municipal entities to have the ability
 
01:50:25.629 --> 01:50:25.639 align:start position:0%
to take them back because when we were
 
01:50:28.030 --> 01:50:28.040 align:start position:0%
talking I think in our subcommittee one
 
01:50:30.550 --> 01:50:30.560 align:start position:0%
of the discussions um was about well
 
01:50:32.629 --> 01:50:32.639 align:start position:0%
what happens if there isn't one nearby
 
01:50:35.790 --> 01:50:35.800 align:start position:0%
me what do I do then right and so how do
 
01:50:37.950 --> 01:50:37.960 align:start position:0%
we Empower our local municipalities to
 
01:50:40.709 --> 01:50:40.719 align:start position:0%
say okay I'm willing to take this on I
 
01:50:42.189 --> 01:50:42.199 align:start position:0%
think we had
 
01:50:45.910 --> 01:50:45.920 align:start position:0%
um Sarah speak to that um in her
 
01:50:48.270 --> 01:50:48.280 align:start position:0%
community and I think it could be
 
01:50:51.270 --> 01:50:51.280 align:start position:0%
replicated elsewhere as well um I don't
 
01:50:53.149 --> 01:50:53.159 align:start position:0%
know Sarah did you wan to do you have
 
01:51:02.470 --> 01:51:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:05.350 --> 01:51:05.360 align:start position:0%
additional thank you for the question I
 
01:51:07.589 --> 01:51:07.599 align:start position:0%
actually went up to Vermont and in
 
01:51:10.229 --> 01:51:10.239 align:start position:0%
Burlington and saw their program up
 
01:51:13.470 --> 01:51:13.480 align:start position:0%
there and uh as a hazardous waste
 
01:51:16.310 --> 01:51:16.320 align:start position:0%
program I take only the oilbased paint
 
01:51:18.669 --> 01:51:18.679 align:start position:0%
now but under the paint CARE program I
 
01:51:22.030 --> 01:51:22.040 align:start position:0%
would also take the latex only I would
 
01:51:24.629 --> 01:51:24.639 align:start position:0%
not be responsible for paying for all of
 
01:51:26.870 --> 01:51:26.880 align:start position:0%
that disposal and it's one of our
 
01:51:29.910 --> 01:51:29.920 align:start position:0%
biggest uh Products that come in paint
 
01:51:32.430 --> 01:51:32.440 align:start position:0%
care would take care of sending a waste
 
01:51:34.589 --> 01:51:34.599 align:start position:0%
holler to come and pick it up and remove
 
01:51:38.310 --> 01:51:38.320 align:start position:0%
it from my hazardous waste facility and
 
01:51:40.910 --> 01:51:40.920 align:start position:0%
I believe it would be the same process
 
01:51:43.990 --> 01:51:44.000 align:start position:0%
if it was like Home Depot or some little
 
01:51:46.629 --> 01:51:46.639 align:start position:0%
paint store in a small town they would
 
01:51:48.470 --> 01:51:48.480 align:start position:0%
collect it at their place and the paint
 
01:51:51.109 --> 01:51:51.119 align:start position:0%
care people would come down and send
 
01:51:54.229 --> 01:51:54.239 align:start position:0%
someone there a waste huler to remove it
 
01:51:57.109 --> 01:51:57.119 align:start position:0%
and this would be possible if it to for
 
01:51:59.790 --> 01:51:59.800 align:start position:0%
them the little retailer to take the
 
01:52:03.030 --> 01:52:03.040 align:start position:0%
oilbased paint as well as latex if it
 
01:52:05.589 --> 01:52:05.599 align:start position:0%
was a universal waste like uh some
 
01:52:08.550 --> 01:52:08.560 align:start position:0%
Mercury objects and antifreeze and I'm
 
01:52:13.589 --> 01:52:13.599 align:start position:0%
sure yes can explain that better than I
 
01:52:13.599 --> 01:52:14.910 align:start position:0%
sure yes can explain that better than I
representative

01:52:14.910 --> 01:52:14.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:52:17.350 --> 01:52:17.360 align:start position:0%
Katon you guys may to whoever can answer
 
01:52:19.830 --> 01:52:19.840 align:start position:0%
this question I know does this include
 
01:52:23.189 --> 01:52:23.199 align:start position:0%
polyurethane varnish shellac or is it
 
01:52:26.589 --> 01:52:26.599 align:start position:0%
just oilbased
 
01:52:28.430 --> 01:52:28.440 align:start position:0%
come on
 
01:52:31.709 --> 01:52:31.719 align:start position:0%
up I'm not sure how that goes into
 
01:52:33.350 --> 01:52:33.360 align:start position:0%
spending hundreds of hours in my wood
 
01:52:38.430 --> 01:52:38.440 align:start position:0%
shop it it sort of strikes me
 
01:52:41.109 --> 01:52:41.119 align:start position:0%
as I can't actually answer that question
 
01:52:44.069 --> 01:52:44.079 align:start position:0%
I don't I'm not I'm not no I can't can
 
01:52:47.109 --> 01:52:47.119 align:start position:0%
I'm not exactly sure whether poer things
 
01:52:49.069 --> 01:52:49.079 align:start position:0%
I don't believe they would be covered
 
01:52:50.870 --> 01:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
okay um but I'd have to look more into
 
01:52:53.790 --> 01:52:53.800 align:start position:0%
that um I will just to get to the just
 
01:52:57.430 --> 01:52:57.440 align:start position:0%
to also weigh in on on the collection
 
01:53:00.030 --> 01:53:00.040 align:start position:0%
facilities I talked to Vermont and they
 
01:53:01.750 --> 01:53:01.760 align:start position:0%
they said that a lot of their transfer
 
01:53:04.990 --> 01:53:05.000 align:start position:0%
stations do it a lot of retailers do it
 
01:53:07.189 --> 01:53:07.199 align:start position:0%
but the big box stores Home Depot Lowe's
 
01:53:09.709 --> 01:53:09.719 align:start position:0%
and Walmart don't they have to
 
01:53:11.310 --> 01:53:11.320 align:start position:0%
participate in that they collect the
 
01:53:13.550 --> 01:53:13.560 align:start position:0%
fees but they don't have to participate
 
01:53:17.030 --> 01:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
by being a takeback station so the big
 
01:53:19.350 --> 01:53:19.360 align:start position:0%
box stores don't do it but sh Sherwin
 
01:53:21.430 --> 01:53:21.440 align:start position:0%
Williams and Benjamin Moore stores do in
 
01:53:28.830 --> 01:53:28.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:32.990 --> 01:53:33.000 align:start position:0%
MH in Vermont I know they took some
 
01:53:36.550 --> 01:53:36.560 align:start position:0%
stains some stains contain polyurethane
 
01:53:39.430 --> 01:53:39.440 align:start position:0%
some do not but I can't Enlighten you
 
01:53:42.310 --> 01:53:42.320 align:start position:0%
anymore on that as well okay thank you
 
01:53:43.709 --> 01:53:43.719 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if that's something I can
 
01:53:45.830 --> 01:53:45.840 align:start position:0%
get clarified through paint care too as
 
01:53:50.189 --> 01:53:50.199 align:start position:0%
well as yeah yeah so represent Howard
 
01:53:52.550 --> 01:53:52.560 align:start position:0%
this may be an ignorant question but is
 
01:53:54.910 --> 01:53:54.920 align:start position:0%
this only is this only liquid paint or
 
01:53:59.550 --> 01:53:59.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:03.430 --> 01:54:03.440 align:start position:0%
cans well I think that um that's a fair
 
01:54:07.669 --> 01:54:07.679 align:start position:0%
fair point when when the I don't want to
 
01:54:08.629 --> 01:54:08.639 align:start position:0%
let me
 
01:54:11.709 --> 01:54:11.719 align:start position:0%
clarify um but I I do know that even
 
01:54:14.470 --> 01:54:14.480 align:start position:0%
just talking with um some folks this
 
01:54:16.589 --> 01:54:16.599 align:start position:0%
morning you know
 
01:54:19.629 --> 01:54:19.639 align:start position:0%
um whether you have like an eighth of a
 
01:54:21.629 --> 01:54:21.639 align:start position:0%
gallon left or like whatever it is you
 
01:54:24.310 --> 01:54:24.320 align:start position:0%
know folks traditionally are are either
 
01:54:26.109 --> 01:54:26.119 align:start position:0%
pouring it out and letting it dry and
 
01:54:30.550 --> 01:54:30.560 align:start position:0%
then adding it back into it uh their you
 
01:54:32.950 --> 01:54:32.960 align:start position:0%
know into their landfilling waste so to
 
01:54:37.270 --> 01:54:37.280 align:start position:0%
speak and I think that um there are like
 
01:54:39.470 --> 01:54:39.480 align:start position:0%
situations where paint ding can be re
 
01:54:42.430 --> 01:54:42.440 align:start position:0%
like through through solent re
 
01:54:44.830 --> 01:54:44.840 align:start position:0%
reawakened I guess you want to say uh to
 
01:54:47.430 --> 01:54:47.440 align:start position:0%
be reconstituted and reused but I'm I I
 
01:54:49.390 --> 01:54:49.400 align:start position:0%
can find out an answer to
 
01:54:54.350 --> 01:54:54.360 align:start position:0%
that okay represent dsy uh yeah uh my
 
01:54:56.310 --> 01:54:56.320 align:start position:0%
understanding is that it would only be
 
01:54:57.950 --> 01:54:57.960 align:start position:0%
the liquid paint because basically what
 
01:55:00.149 --> 01:55:00.159 align:start position:0%
they're doing is they're mixing it
 
01:55:03.270 --> 01:55:03.280 align:start position:0%
together and and recycling it so so
 
01:55:05.910 --> 01:55:05.920 align:start position:0%
basically the recycled paint is going to
 
01:55:08.510 --> 01:55:08.520 align:start position:0%
be given away to like nonprofits sold at
 
01:55:11.069 --> 01:55:11.079 align:start position:0%
a discount um you know that type of
 
01:55:14.149 --> 01:55:14.159 align:start position:0%
thing and if you have an empty paint can
 
01:55:16.510 --> 01:55:16.520 align:start position:0%
or you had a dried paint can then that
 
01:55:20.229 --> 01:55:20.239 align:start position:0%
can just be thrown into the um uh
 
01:55:22.470 --> 01:55:22.480 align:start position:0%
landfill okay so that's not a problem
 
01:55:24.910 --> 01:55:24.920 align:start position:0%
although last year I did do that I
 
01:55:27.350 --> 01:55:27.360 align:start position:0%
opened up a some paint and let it dry it
 
01:55:29.910 --> 01:55:29.920 align:start position:0%
took about six to eight months a year
 
01:55:31.910 --> 01:55:31.920 align:start position:0%
takes a long time for paint to dry when
 
01:55:32.990 --> 01:55:33.000 align:start position:0%
it's in a
 
01:55:35.629 --> 01:55:35.639 align:start position:0%
can but but otherwise I would imagine
 
01:55:38.390 --> 01:55:38.400 align:start position:0%
the can itself could be recycled in the
 
01:55:41.550 --> 01:55:41.560 align:start position:0%
metal bin or whatever you could put as
 
01:55:43.229 --> 01:55:43.239 align:start position:0%
me as a metal
 
01:55:46.950 --> 01:55:46.960 align:start position:0%
can as the paint dries it shrinks so you
 
01:55:48.910 --> 01:55:48.920 align:start position:0%
could probably just dump that out and
 
01:55:52.510 --> 01:55:52.520 align:start position:0%
yeah probably representative NAB thank
 
01:55:54.669 --> 01:55:54.679 align:start position:0%
you madam chair I just um look to answer
 
01:55:56.149 --> 01:55:56.159 align:start position:0%
representative kryton's question on the
 
01:55:58.470 --> 01:55:58.480 align:start position:0%
paint care website it says they accept
 
01:56:00.589 --> 01:56:00.599 align:start position:0%
primer stained sealers and clear coting
 
01:56:02.990 --> 01:56:03.000 align:start position:0%
such such as shellac and
 
01:56:05.950 --> 01:56:05.960 align:start position:0%
barnish it says yes yeah represent H
 
01:56:08.910 --> 01:56:08.920 align:start position:0%
Haskins Madam chair um Miss Sarah has a
 
01:56:10.790 --> 01:56:10.800 align:start position:0%
point and would you identify yourself
 
01:56:13.709 --> 01:56:13.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:16.550 --> 01:56:16.560 align:start position:0%
please yes I'm Sarah silk from wol New
 
01:56:18.350 --> 01:56:18.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I've run that Lakes Region
 
01:56:21.709 --> 01:56:21.719 align:start position:0%
household Hazard product facility for 35
 
01:56:24.430 --> 01:56:24.440 align:start position:0%
years towns of Alton and wolfboro
 
01:56:26.870 --> 01:56:26.880 align:start position:0%
members and we take anyone from anywhere
 
01:56:31.990 --> 01:56:32.000 align:start position:0%
on a fee basis we take um liquid paint
 
01:56:34.189 --> 01:56:34.199 align:start position:0%
uh several of the representatives here
 
01:56:36.310 --> 01:56:36.320 align:start position:0%
have mentioned if it's a latex paint or
 
01:56:38.470 --> 01:56:38.480 align:start position:0%
an oilbased paint and it's totally hard
 
01:56:41.750 --> 01:56:41.760 align:start position:0%
in the can then that goes to Solid Waste
 
01:56:44.629 --> 01:56:44.639 align:start position:0%
the recycled paint is the latex paint
 
01:56:46.470 --> 01:56:46.480 align:start position:0%
which they add mil aside and other
 
01:56:50.069 --> 01:56:50.079 align:start position:0%
things to to make it new they don't
 
01:56:53.589 --> 01:56:53.599 align:start position:0%
recycle the oilbased paint into paint
 
01:56:57.430 --> 01:56:57.440 align:start position:0%
they sell to anybody that comes by like
 
01:56:59.990 --> 01:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
up at the program in Burlington the only
 
01:57:03.470 --> 01:57:03.480 align:start position:0%
thing that they reprocess is the latex
 
01:57:06.510 --> 01:57:06.520 align:start position:0%
not the oil base that always goes with a
 
01:57:06.520 --> 01:57:07.629 align:start position:0%
not the oil base that always goes with a
waste

01:57:07.629 --> 01:57:07.639 align:start position:0%
waste
 
01:57:10.189 --> 01:57:10.199 align:start position:0%
huler like it's hazardous waste all
 
01:57:13.790 --> 01:57:13.800 align:start position:0%
right thank you for that um so for me
 
01:57:16.109 --> 01:57:16.119 align:start position:0%
before going back to your comment about
 
01:57:21.149 --> 01:57:21.159 align:start position:0%
um a May versus a sh in so far as um
 
01:57:24.189 --> 01:57:24.199 align:start position:0%
participating retailers participating in
 
01:57:24.199 --> 01:57:25.069 align:start position:0%
participating retailers participating in
the

01:57:25.069 --> 01:57:25.079 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:57:29.510 --> 01:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
program um I I'd prefer to see a May
 
01:57:32.310 --> 01:57:32.320 align:start position:0%
instead of a sh in there because first
 
01:57:33.910 --> 01:57:33.920 align:start position:0%
of all this this is going to be kind of
 
01:57:37.270 --> 01:57:37.280 align:start position:0%
a pilot program it's going to be uh
 
01:57:43.149 --> 01:57:43.159 align:start position:0%
something that um once once the public
 
01:57:47.030 --> 01:57:47.040 align:start position:0%
finds out about this they may uh want to
 
01:57:49.229 --> 01:57:49.239 align:start position:0%
seek out retailers specifically that are
 
01:57:51.589 --> 01:57:51.599 align:start position:0%
doing this and as it becomes more
 
01:57:51.599 --> 01:57:52.910 align:start position:0%
doing this and as it becomes more
popular

01:57:52.910 --> 01:57:52.920 align:start position:0%
popular
 
01:57:55.390 --> 01:57:55.400 align:start position:0%
um I think you know it'll it'll it won't
 
01:57:59.510 --> 01:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
need a sh you know representative Bixby
 
01:58:01.589 --> 01:58:01.599 align:start position:0%
yeah I think that in talking about the
 
01:58:04.790 --> 01:58:04.800 align:start position:0%
participation I think that uh the in
 
01:58:08.550 --> 01:58:08.560 align:start position:0%
terms of uh accepting the paint back or
 
01:58:11.790 --> 01:58:11.800 align:start position:0%
except uh or or or being a drop off site
 
01:58:14.750 --> 01:58:14.760 align:start position:0%
I think that that should be a May uh
 
01:58:19.669 --> 01:58:19.679 align:start position:0%
because um I I thinking that uh not I'm
 
01:58:23.709 --> 01:58:23.719 align:start position:0%
thinking there there are two possible
 
01:58:26.629 --> 01:58:26.639 align:start position:0%
uh groups here that might not want to
 
01:58:29.069 --> 01:58:29.079 align:start position:0%
participate one are the very large box
 
01:58:31.069 --> 01:58:31.079 align:start position:0%
retailers which we've heard testimony
 
01:58:34.550 --> 01:58:34.560 align:start position:0%
that they tend not to the other is uh
 
01:58:38.430 --> 01:58:38.440 align:start position:0%
are uh very few remaining uh really
 
01:58:41.589 --> 01:58:41.599 align:start position:0%
independent uh hardware stores might not
 
01:58:44.629 --> 01:58:44.639 align:start position:0%
have the capacity to do this uh and and
 
01:58:46.830 --> 01:58:46.840 align:start position:0%
I I know that uh it's been cited that
 
01:58:48.629 --> 01:58:48.639 align:start position:0%
the Ace Hardwares and the Sherman
 
01:58:52.189 --> 01:58:52.199 align:start position:0%
Williams are already participating and
 
01:58:54.470 --> 01:58:54.480 align:start position:0%
that's you know it's great that they're
 
01:58:57.629 --> 01:58:57.639 align:start position:0%
doing that but um in the states where
 
01:59:00.790 --> 01:59:00.800 align:start position:0%
this is a thing uh in terms of uh but
 
01:59:02.950 --> 01:59:02.960 align:start position:0%
there's the other aspect of it is in
 
01:59:06.470 --> 01:59:06.480 align:start position:0%
terms of paying the uh of adding the fee
 
01:59:08.669 --> 01:59:08.679 align:start position:0%
to the price of the paint and I think
 
01:59:11.270 --> 01:59:11.280 align:start position:0%
that one should be a sh
 
01:59:15.830 --> 01:59:15.840 align:start position:0%
agre okay represent dsy and then kraton
 
01:59:17.270 --> 01:59:17.280 align:start position:0%
yeah the only question that I had and
 
01:59:20.350 --> 01:59:20.360 align:start position:0%
this was in the original bill um I
 
01:59:22.790 --> 01:59:22.800 align:start position:0%
didn't read anything about what we do
 
01:59:25.870 --> 01:59:25.880 align:start position:0%
about the existing paint cans that we
 
01:59:29.030 --> 01:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
have in our our basement um because I
 
01:59:32.910 --> 01:59:32.920 align:start position:0%
would assume that that there was not a
 
01:59:35.310 --> 01:59:35.320 align:start position:0%
fee Associated to them when we bought
 
01:59:38.950 --> 01:59:38.960 align:start position:0%
them like 10 or 15 years ago you know so
 
01:59:42.069 --> 01:59:42.079 align:start position:0%
is there some provision that I can take
 
01:59:47.229 --> 01:59:47.239 align:start position:0%
them back um and pay a $2 fee or is it
 
01:59:51.030 --> 01:59:51.040 align:start position:0%
just assumed that you know eventually
 
01:59:53.069 --> 01:59:53.079 align:start position:0%
these Legacy can are going to be taken
 
01:59:58.709 --> 01:59:58.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:01.830 --> 02:00:01.840 align:start position:0%
back U representative kraton and then
 
02:00:01.840 --> 02:00:03.990 align:start position:0%
back U representative kraton and then
you

02:00:03.990 --> 02:00:04.000 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:00:06.109 --> 02:00:06.119 align:start position:0%
guys thank you madam
 
02:00:08.910 --> 02:00:08.920 align:start position:0%
chair this thing makes a lot of sense to
 
02:00:08.920 --> 02:00:10.390 align:start position:0%
chair this thing makes a lot of sense to
me

02:00:10.390 --> 02:00:10.400 align:start position:0%
me
 
02:00:13.669 --> 02:00:13.679 align:start position:0%
um the one question about the May versus
 
02:00:17.270 --> 02:00:17.280 align:start position:0%
shell is that okay so I pay a buck a
 
02:00:20.669 --> 02:00:20.679 align:start position:0%
gallon to have this program in the state
 
02:00:24.229 --> 02:00:24.239 align:start position:0%
that makes sense but if I live in antrum
 
02:00:26.550 --> 02:00:26.560 align:start position:0%
and I have to travel 30 miles to find a
 
02:00:29.589 --> 02:00:29.599 align:start position:0%
facility that actually takes it then why
 
02:00:33.310 --> 02:00:33.320 align:start position:0%
am I pay in a buck to do
 
02:00:35.470 --> 02:00:35.480 align:start position:0%
that yeah go ahead representative to
 
02:00:37.109 --> 02:00:37.119 align:start position:0%
your point representative I think that
 
02:00:38.830 --> 02:00:38.840 align:start position:0%
that's why we're saying that this can
 
02:00:41.430 --> 02:00:41.440 align:start position:0%
either be a major retailer or a transfer
 
02:00:44.109 --> 02:00:44.119 align:start position:0%
station or some other entity that
 
02:00:46.109 --> 02:00:46.119 align:start position:0%
receives them so that there aren't large
 
02:00:48.310 --> 02:00:48.320 align:start position:0%
distances for people to travel where
 
02:00:50.629 --> 02:00:50.639 align:start position:0%
there isn't an opportunity okay Madam
 
02:00:53.750 --> 02:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
shair follow and so how do I know that
 
02:00:53.760 --> 02:00:55.270 align:start position:0%
shair follow and so how do I know that
the

02:00:55.270 --> 02:00:55.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:00:58.790 --> 02:00:58.800 align:start position:0%
Anum recycle or the the antrum dump will
 
02:01:01.750 --> 02:01:01.760 align:start position:0%
be able to do that or is GNA do that
 
02:01:03.229 --> 02:01:03.239 align:start position:0%
that's a great Point um so because I
 
02:01:05.430 --> 02:01:05.440 align:start position:0%
don't have access to Hillsboro right or
 
02:01:09.229 --> 02:01:09.239 align:start position:0%
Bennington or any other Town yes ma'am
 
02:01:11.310 --> 02:01:11.320 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry sure yes thank you madam chair
 
02:01:13.629 --> 02:01:13.639 align:start position:0%
um so yes uh also within this the
 
02:01:16.430 --> 02:01:16.440 align:start position:0%
department um has the ability to post on
 
02:01:19.669 --> 02:01:19.679 align:start position:0%
their website where these locations are
 
02:01:22.189 --> 02:01:22.199 align:start position:0%
and so um if that's what you're saying
 
02:01:24.350 --> 02:01:24.360 align:start position:0%
when you're looking for a and paint care
 
02:01:26.669 --> 02:01:26.679 align:start position:0%
can provide a list to the Department of
 
02:01:27.910 --> 02:01:27.920 align:start position:0%
where those sites are throughout the
 
02:01:30.229 --> 02:01:30.239 align:start position:0%
state is that what you're
 
02:01:32.149 --> 02:01:32.159 align:start position:0%
asking go
 
02:01:35.149 --> 02:01:35.159 align:start position:0%
ahead no my point is that I go down to
 
02:01:37.270 --> 02:01:37.280 align:start position:0%
Edmond's Hardware which I do like every
 
02:01:40.069 --> 02:01:40.079 align:start position:0%
day and I buy paint which I do all the
 
02:01:42.589 --> 02:01:42.599 align:start position:0%
time and I pay an extra Buck for a
 
02:01:45.430 --> 02:01:45.440 align:start position:0%
gallon and I'm willing to do that but
 
02:01:48.550 --> 02:01:48.560 align:start position:0%
the Anum transfer station doesn't take
 
02:01:51.350 --> 02:01:51.360 align:start position:0%
it and I live in the middle of nowhere
 
02:01:53.750 --> 02:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
and so if Edmond doesn't take it then
 
02:01:53.760 --> 02:01:54.550 align:start position:0%
and so if Edmond doesn't take it then
who

02:01:54.550 --> 02:01:54.560 align:start position:0%
who
 
02:01:57.750 --> 02:01:57.760 align:start position:0%
does and do I have to travel 30 miles to
 
02:02:00.310 --> 02:02:00.320 align:start position:0%
get there if the Anum transfer station
 
02:02:01.430 --> 02:02:01.440 align:start position:0%
because I'm not allowed to go to
 
02:02:03.510 --> 02:02:03.520 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro I'm not allowed to go to B I
 
02:02:04.669 --> 02:02:04.679 align:start position:0%
have the
 
02:02:06.870 --> 02:02:06.880 align:start position:0%
sticker no I understand and I appreciate
 
02:02:12.069 --> 02:02:12.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:14.990 --> 02:02:15.000 align:start position:0%
that thank you I appreciate that
 
02:02:16.870 --> 02:02:16.880 align:start position:0%
representative Duty I just want to
 
02:02:19.350 --> 02:02:19.360 align:start position:0%
interject if you go up on paint care and
 
02:02:21.350 --> 02:02:21.360 align:start position:0%
look at Vermont and look at all of the
 
02:02:24.310 --> 02:02:24.320 align:start position:0%
drop off stations okay the little things
 
02:02:26.510 --> 02:02:26.520 align:start position:0%
I mean it covers the whole state you
 
02:02:29.589 --> 02:02:29.599 align:start position:0%
know so so I mean um the the chances of
 
02:02:31.149 --> 02:02:31.159 align:start position:0%
you having to drive 30 miles I think
 
02:02:33.149 --> 02:02:33.159 align:start position:0%
would be very slim even you know like up
 
02:02:35.270 --> 02:02:35.280 align:start position:0%
north in the rural parts of it so I
 
02:02:37.550 --> 02:02:37.560 align:start position:0%
think that's a good place to start yeah
 
02:02:40.669 --> 02:02:40.679 align:start position:0%
okay thank you represent Bixby okay so
 
02:02:44.550 --> 02:02:44.560 align:start position:0%
in terms of um Municipal whether
 
02:02:47.750 --> 02:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities have uh May or shall
 
02:02:51.069 --> 02:02:51.079 align:start position:0%
participate in this is is there anything
 
02:02:54.350 --> 02:02:54.360 align:start position:0%
uh in the the draft at this point that
 
02:02:57.950 --> 02:02:57.960 align:start position:0%
says that um a transportation or a or a
 
02:03:02.629 --> 02:03:02.639 align:start position:0%
City Recycling um program um May or
 
02:03:04.790 --> 02:03:04.800 align:start position:0%
shall do this
 
02:03:09.990 --> 02:03:10.000 align:start position:0%
yes so I I I did say on page three
 
02:03:12.950 --> 02:03:12.960 align:start position:0%
um section five when we're talking about
 
02:03:12.960 --> 02:03:14.470 align:start position:0%
um section five when we're talking about
geographic

02:03:14.470 --> 02:03:14.480 align:start position:0%
geographic
 
02:03:16.910 --> 02:03:16.920 align:start position:0%
information it says one additional U
 
02:03:18.229 --> 02:03:18.239 align:start position:0%
permanent site will be established for
 
02:03:20.830 --> 02:03:20.840 align:start position:0%
every 10,000 residents we talked about
 
02:03:23.229 --> 02:03:23.239 align:start position:0%
um the residency requirement and then it
 
02:03:24.790 --> 02:03:24.800 align:start position:0%
says unless otherwise approved by the
 
02:03:27.149 --> 02:03:27.159 align:start position:0%
department these sites may be run by
 
02:03:28.990 --> 02:03:29.000 align:start position:0%
political subdivisions such as transfer
 
02:03:30.790 --> 02:03:30.800 align:start position:0%
stations I'm willing this is a draft
 
02:03:33.310 --> 02:03:33.320 align:start position:0%
like I'm willing to put in there
 
02:03:34.870 --> 02:03:34.880 align:start position:0%
anything else that would make you know
 
02:03:36.629 --> 02:03:36.639 align:start position:0%
if it's if it's preferable that it is a
 
02:03:38.709 --> 02:03:38.719 align:start position:0%
shell so that we have the ability for
 
02:03:40.669 --> 02:03:40.679 align:start position:0%
folks in rural communities to be able to
 
02:03:42.790 --> 02:03:42.800 align:start position:0%
do that and then call up paint care and
 
02:03:45.270 --> 02:03:45.280 align:start position:0%
say hey my friends we have our we have
 
02:03:47.870 --> 02:03:47.880 align:start position:0%
our stuff that needs picked up can you
 
02:03:50.510 --> 02:03:50.520 align:start position:0%
send a hauler please um I think that
 
02:03:52.310 --> 02:03:52.320 align:start position:0%
that makes sense if you prefer for it to
 
02:03:55.069 --> 02:03:55.079 align:start position:0%
be a shall I'm happy to do that I'm
 
02:03:59.669 --> 02:03:59.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:02.549 --> 02:04:02.559 align:start position:0%
yes okay representative Howard and then
 
02:04:05.709 --> 02:04:05.719 align:start position:0%
Penza um two two things about the fees
 
02:04:08.109 --> 02:04:08.119 align:start position:0%
one of them is um one is a suggestion
 
02:04:10.229 --> 02:04:10.239 align:start position:0%
one the other's a question so if if we
 
02:04:13.549 --> 02:04:13.559 align:start position:0%
say um may we could may we could attach
 
02:04:17.030 --> 02:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
a an incentive to that um but also I
 
02:04:20.430 --> 02:04:20.440 align:start position:0%
wonder as far as these feeds go do they
 
02:04:22.430 --> 02:04:22.440 align:start position:0%
all go to the plan and nothing goes to
 
02:04:25.229 --> 02:04:25.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:28.549 --> 02:04:28.559 align:start position:0%
vendor representative Bixby uh I believe
 
02:04:32.589 --> 02:04:32.599 align:start position:0%
the way that it works is that um all of
 
02:04:36.510 --> 02:04:36.520 align:start position:0%
the fees are uh go to the are basically
 
02:04:40.030 --> 02:04:40.040 align:start position:0%
processed by the paint CARE program and
 
02:04:43.229 --> 02:04:43.239 align:start position:0%
if the vendor is running a pickup
 
02:04:48.030 --> 02:04:48.040 align:start position:0%
station then the vendor would get the um
 
02:04:50.549 --> 02:04:50.559 align:start position:0%
get appropriate payment in order to
 
02:04:53.270 --> 02:04:53.280 align:start position:0%
handle that uh if they are not doing
 
02:04:56.109 --> 02:04:56.119 align:start position:0%
pickup then they you then they they
 
02:04:59.589 --> 02:04:59.599 align:start position:0%
would just pass the fees on to pain care
 
02:05:04.350 --> 02:05:04.360 align:start position:0%
and not get anything back uh and if the
 
02:05:06.910 --> 02:05:06.920 align:start position:0%
uh is that correct right and that was my
 
02:05:08.950 --> 02:05:08.960 align:start position:0%
and that is where my discussion enters
 
02:05:10.669 --> 02:05:10.679 align:start position:0%
into the conversation about should there
 
02:05:12.510 --> 02:05:12.520 align:start position:0%
be a small portion of the fee reserved
 
02:05:15.069 --> 02:05:15.079 align:start position:0%
for the Department to be able to do some
 
02:05:17.149 --> 02:05:17.159 align:start position:0%
of the ongoing oversight management of
 
02:05:19.270 --> 02:05:19.280 align:start position:0%
this so it's not an undue burden to them
 
02:05:22.709 --> 02:05:22.719 align:start position:0%
and if that needs to happen then how do
 
02:05:25.629 --> 02:05:25.639 align:start position:0%
I um my my conversation with paint care
 
02:05:28.270 --> 02:05:28.280 align:start position:0%
is how do I structure that so that's
 
02:05:29.990 --> 02:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
that's really my question for paint care
 
02:05:33.149 --> 02:05:33.159 align:start position:0%
okay um let me get representative Penza
 
02:05:36.069 --> 02:05:36.079 align:start position:0%
and then you so just kind of following
 
02:05:38.430 --> 02:05:38.440 align:start position:0%
up with what representative Duty asked
 
02:05:41.510 --> 02:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
so if you because I I don't have it now
 
02:05:43.229 --> 02:05:43.239 align:start position:0%
but we did so if you have a whole bunch
 
02:05:45.870 --> 02:05:45.880 align:start position:0%
of old paint it just seems like
 
02:05:47.270 --> 02:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
everybody does right and it's hanging
 
02:05:49.189 --> 02:05:49.199 align:start position:0%
out in their garage if they don't hit
 
02:05:51.390 --> 02:05:51.400 align:start position:0%
that one day of the year where it comes
 
02:05:54.669 --> 02:05:54.679 align:start position:0%
where they um some cities municipalities
 
02:05:56.390 --> 02:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
and towns have a
 
02:06:00.189 --> 02:06:00.199 align:start position:0%
pickup is there a point where that paint
 
02:06:03.270 --> 02:06:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:05.510 --> 02:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
unusable I have that question down to
 
02:06:07.870 --> 02:06:07.880 align:start position:0%
ask with with folks to make sure that we
 
02:06:10.870 --> 02:06:10.880 align:start position:0%
can deal with the Legacy paint concern
 
02:06:12.629 --> 02:06:12.639 align:start position:0%
Bixby I have a question for the
 
02:06:17.750 --> 02:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
Department um so uh are there uh are
 
02:06:19.589 --> 02:06:19.599 align:start position:0%
there th under department rules are
 
02:06:22.709 --> 02:06:22.719 align:start position:0%
there things that uh transfer stations
 
02:06:25.510 --> 02:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
are required to cover in their in what
 
02:06:27.709 --> 02:06:27.719 align:start position:0%
they accept as
 
02:06:30.589 --> 02:06:30.599 align:start position:0%
trash well that's more of a solid waste
 
02:06:32.510 --> 02:06:32.520 align:start position:0%
question and I'm in hazardous waste so
 
02:06:33.950 --> 02:06:33.960 align:start position:0%
what's in their permit what's in their
 
02:06:36.669 --> 02:06:36.679 align:start position:0%
Solid Waste permit and actually Sarah
 
02:06:39.790 --> 02:06:39.800 align:start position:0%
could probably answer that more directly
 
02:06:41.870 --> 02:06:41.880 align:start position:0%
than I
 
02:06:46.709 --> 02:06:46.719 align:start position:0%
could yep go ahead a actually um I don't
 
02:06:48.430 --> 02:06:48.440 align:start position:0%
actually deal with solid waste I was a
 
02:06:50.229 --> 02:06:50.239 align:start position:0%
selectman for 13 years but I can tell
 
02:06:53.229 --> 02:06:53.239 align:start position:0%
you I get tons of calls from the city of
 
02:06:57.750 --> 02:06:57.760 align:start position:0%
lonia because they do not take any type
 
02:07:00.750 --> 02:07:00.760 align:start position:0%
of mercury light bulbs in the whatever
 
02:07:02.229 --> 02:07:02.239 align:start position:0%
contract they have with their waste
 
02:07:04.189 --> 02:07:04.199 align:start position:0%
holler which I think is waste management
 
02:07:07.470 --> 02:07:07.480 align:start position:0%
but they may have changed we take it
 
02:07:10.149 --> 02:07:10.159 align:start position:0%
because we belong and Alton takes them
 
02:07:12.669 --> 02:07:12.679 align:start position:0%
along with a lot of other Universal Wast
 
02:07:16.430 --> 02:07:16.440 align:start position:0%
because we belong to NR and it's a
 
02:07:20.229 --> 02:07:20.239 align:start position:0%
monetary advantage to belong to the NRA
 
02:07:24.910 --> 02:07:24.920 align:start position:0%
programs so so I don't think that um
 
02:07:27.549 --> 02:07:27.559 align:start position:0%
towns are required to take all waist
 
02:07:30.950 --> 02:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
streams personally I think they should
 
02:07:33.830 --> 02:07:33.840 align:start position:0%
because then it's a burden if someone
 
02:07:36.229 --> 02:07:36.239 align:start position:0%
has an apartment building for example
 
02:07:38.350 --> 02:07:38.360 align:start position:0%
and wants to get rid of all of the
 
02:07:41.149 --> 02:07:41.159 align:start position:0%
Mercury tubes and go to something that
 
02:07:44.189 --> 02:07:44.199 align:start position:0%
is safer now they have no way to dispose
 
02:07:47.069 --> 02:07:47.079 align:start position:0%
of them in lonia because they don't
 
02:07:51.910 --> 02:07:51.920 align:start position:0%
handle it but as Todd said we're neither
 
02:07:55.470 --> 02:07:55.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:59.149 --> 02:07:59.159 align:start position:0%
waste any other questions or
 
02:08:03.470 --> 02:08:03.480 align:start position:0%
comments no all right I um oh okay yeah
 
02:08:05.750 --> 02:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
go ahead could I just add one little
 
02:08:07.470 --> 02:08:07.480 align:start position:0%
thing relative to what do you do with
 
02:08:08.950 --> 02:08:08.960 align:start position:0%
the old paint that people have had in
 
02:08:10.790 --> 02:08:10.800 align:start position:0%
their basement for hundred
 
02:08:13.270 --> 02:08:13.280 align:start position:0%
years the people that buy the paint
 
02:08:15.950 --> 02:08:15.960 align:start position:0%
today if the paint CARE program is in
 
02:08:19.109 --> 02:08:19.119 align:start position:0%
place will be paying a dollar they will
 
02:08:21.510 --> 02:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
not be returning all of that paint that
 
02:08:23.790 --> 02:08:23.800 align:start position:0%
they bought if they buy four gallons
 
02:08:26.270 --> 02:08:26.280 align:start position:0%
they may be using three of them maybe
 
02:08:29.030 --> 02:08:29.040 align:start position:0%
three and a half the people that bring
 
02:08:30.830 --> 02:08:30.840 align:start position:0%
in a can or two of paint that's been in
 
02:08:33.950 --> 02:08:33.960 align:start position:0%
the basement I think it'll be a
 
02:08:36.470 --> 02:08:36.480 align:start position:0%
swap because we've been getting that old
 
02:08:39.109 --> 02:08:39.119 align:start position:0%
paint forever and there is some still
 
02:08:41.149 --> 02:08:41.159 align:start position:0%
out there that's absolutely true the
 
02:08:42.990 --> 02:08:43.000 align:start position:0%
amount of oilbased paint that's being
 
02:08:45.229 --> 02:08:45.239 align:start position:0%
sold currently is greatly reduced
 
02:08:47.109 --> 02:08:47.119 align:start position:0%
because most companies don't make it
 
02:08:50.149 --> 02:08:50.159 align:start position:0%
anymore and they can't redo oilbased
 
02:08:53.390 --> 02:08:53.400 align:start position:0%
paint they can only re do
 
02:08:55.069 --> 02:08:55.079 align:start position:0%
latex go
 
02:08:57.990 --> 02:08:58.000 align:start position:0%
ahead just to to follow up on the the
 
02:09:01.629 --> 02:09:01.639 align:start position:0%
point about um the old paint I don't
 
02:09:03.589 --> 02:09:03.599 align:start position:0%
believe with a bottle bill in
 
02:09:05.990 --> 02:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts when you buy a can of beer
 
02:09:08.109 --> 02:09:08.119 align:start position:0%
it says 5cent deposit on it I don't
 
02:09:09.830 --> 02:09:09.840 align:start position:0%
believe the paint cans are going to say
 
02:09:13.470 --> 02:09:13.480 align:start position:0%
$2 or $1 deposit on them so that they're
 
02:09:15.270 --> 02:09:15.280 align:start position:0%
not if you bring in an old can they're
 
02:09:16.589 --> 02:09:16.599 align:start position:0%
not going to know the difference between
 
02:09:18.310 --> 02:09:18.320 align:start position:0%
a new can and an old
 
02:09:21.109 --> 02:09:21.119 align:start position:0%
can can represent Bixby yeah I have a
 
02:09:24.350 --> 02:09:24.360 align:start position:0%
question for representative Murray um do
 
02:09:26.310 --> 02:09:26.320 align:start position:0%
you think that you're going to have this
 
02:09:29.229 --> 02:09:29.239 align:start position:0%
ready to exact next week I was told to
 
02:09:31.350 --> 02:09:31.360 align:start position:0%
be ready for the 19th so I'll be ready
 
02:09:34.390 --> 02:09:34.400 align:start position:0%
yep okay okay because well we have to
 
02:09:35.830 --> 02:09:35.840 align:start position:0%
have our bills out of committee by the
 
02:09:40.910 --> 02:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
21st right and um I don't know do you
 
02:09:44.350 --> 02:09:44.360 align:start position:0%
want us to schedule a work session on
 
02:09:48.390 --> 02:09:48.400 align:start position:0%
this before we execut so we can explain
 
02:09:50.270 --> 02:09:50.280 align:start position:0%
the Amendments and I think that makes
 
02:09:53.189 --> 02:09:53.199 align:start position:0%
sense but I need to uh schedule my next
 
02:09:54.910 --> 02:09:54.920 align:start position:0%
meeting with some of the stakeholders on
 
02:09:56.990 --> 02:09:57.000 align:start position:0%
on the issue so
 
02:09:59.069 --> 02:09:59.079 align:start position:0%
um would it make sense we're meeting
 
02:10:00.910 --> 02:10:00.920 align:start position:0%
Tuesday and Wednesday of next week or
 
02:10:04.189 --> 02:10:04.199 align:start position:0%
just just Tuesday
 
02:10:06.589 --> 02:10:06.599 align:start position:0%
Tuesday so would it we have a nine
 
02:10:09.069 --> 02:10:09.079 align:start position:0%
o'clock on Tuesday as well
 
02:10:11.350 --> 02:10:11.360 align:start position:0%
right I I don't do we have a nine
 
02:10:13.589 --> 02:10:13.599 align:start position:0%
o'clock on Tuesday as well we said the
 
02:10:15.669 --> 02:10:15.679 align:start position:0%
second oh the second so yes we could
 
02:10:19.709 --> 02:10:19.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:21.950 --> 02:10:21.960 align:start position:0%
Tuesday the full sub commmittee work
 
02:10:24.870 --> 02:10:24.880 align:start position:0%
session oh did no I think I think she
 
02:10:27.750 --> 02:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
was suggesting a a full committee work
 
02:10:29.430 --> 02:10:29.440 align:start position:0%
session so you can explain to that's
 
02:10:31.270 --> 02:10:31.280 align:start position:0%
what I was just yeah but we don't have
 
02:10:32.910 --> 02:10:32.920 align:start position:0%
to do that at nine o'clock we could do
 
02:10:35.149 --> 02:10:35.159 align:start position:0%
that at 10 o'clock oh I'm sorry 10 and
 
02:10:36.870 --> 02:10:36.880 align:start position:0%
then you know I can do you want me to
 
02:10:39.549 --> 02:10:39.559 align:start position:0%
like have like a half hour for that yeah
 
02:10:42.470 --> 02:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
and then we can go into exec for all the
 
02:10:44.310 --> 02:10:44.320 align:start position:0%
rest of the bills including this one
 
02:10:48.109 --> 02:10:48.119 align:start position:0%
yeah okay so why don't we do
 
02:10:52.430 --> 02:10:52.440 align:start position:0%
that okay for 9 a.m. or excuse me 10 amm
 
02:10:52.440 --> 02:10:57.750 align:start position:0%
that okay for 9 a.m. or excuse me 10 amm
thank

02:10:57.750 --> 02:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:57.760 --> 02:10:59.390 align:start position:0%
 
you

02:10:59.390 --> 02:10:59.400 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:11:02.109 --> 02:11:02.119 align:start position:0%
okay I mean the the work session the
 
02:11:03.830 --> 02:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
purpose would be just to basically go
 
02:11:06.350 --> 02:11:06.360 align:start position:0%
over the entire Amendment yes so that
 
02:11:09.510 --> 02:11:09.520 align:start position:0%
everybody understands it um we wouldn't
 
02:11:12.030 --> 02:11:12.040 align:start position:0%
have any time to make any changes to it
 
02:11:15.030 --> 02:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
but um you know at least everybody will
 
02:11:16.910 --> 02:11:16.920 align:start position:0%
understand it before we go and vote on
 
02:11:20.030 --> 02:11:20.040 align:start position:0%
it I think so okay thank you
 
02:11:22.910 --> 02:11:22.920 align:start position:0%
yeah okay
 
02:11:27.549 --> 02:11:27.559 align:start position:0%
um well I mean I I think it's a great
 
02:11:29.709 --> 02:11:29.719 align:start position:0%
idea I think it's a great program it's
 
02:11:31.310 --> 02:11:31.320 align:start position:0%
just you know ironing out some of the
 
02:11:36.510 --> 02:11:36.520 align:start position:0%
Kinks of um the workability of it and
 
02:11:40.310 --> 02:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if if anybody has any
 
02:11:40.320 --> 02:11:41.629 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if if anybody has any
objections

02:11:41.629 --> 02:11:41.639 align:start position:0%
objections
 
02:11:41.639 --> 02:11:43.390 align:start position:0%
objections
to

02:11:43.390 --> 02:11:43.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:11:48.149 --> 02:11:48.159 align:start position:0%
this uh proposal I kind of like to know
 
02:11:51.510 --> 02:11:51.520 align:start position:0%
what they are representative ktoa it's
 
02:11:55.549 --> 02:11:55.559 align:start position:0%
not an objection it's just a question um
 
02:11:59.629 --> 02:11:59.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:02.589 --> 02:12:02.599 align:start position:0%
I I still don't understand the logistics
 
02:12:05.350 --> 02:12:05.360 align:start position:0%
for businesses and
 
02:12:07.669 --> 02:12:07.679 align:start position:0%
how what kind of system they're going to
 
02:12:08.709 --> 02:12:08.719 align:start position:0%
have to
 
02:12:12.830 --> 02:12:12.840 align:start position:0%
implement if any into their Software
 
02:12:15.950 --> 02:12:15.960 align:start position:0%
System uh to account for
 
02:12:20.270 --> 02:12:20.280 align:start position:0%
monies and how they're going to make
 
02:12:22.229 --> 02:12:22.239 align:start position:0%
payment it's going to be an additional
 
02:12:27.069 --> 02:12:27.079 align:start position:0%
cost to them so I'm just asking the
 
02:12:30.750 --> 02:12:30.760 align:start position:0%
question just so um and I don't know if
 
02:12:33.430 --> 02:12:33.440 align:start position:0%
we have any answers for that so I do
 
02:12:35.790 --> 02:12:35.800 align:start position:0%
know that paint care does provide
 
02:12:38.709 --> 02:12:38.719 align:start position:0%
guidance to retailers on how to do that
 
02:12:40.709 --> 02:12:40.719 align:start position:0%
even on the back side of this paper um
 
02:12:43.149 --> 02:12:43.159 align:start position:0%
there's an organization within paint
 
02:12:45.990 --> 02:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
care there's a pricing laws like a a
 
02:12:49.430 --> 02:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
link a a sublink and it offers retailer
 
02:12:52.069 --> 02:12:52.079 align:start position:0%
information how on how to disclose it to
 
02:12:55.910 --> 02:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
Consumers how to account for it how to
 
02:12:58.109 --> 02:12:58.119 align:start position:0%
make sure that they're tracking those
 
02:13:02.149 --> 02:13:02.159 align:start position:0%
fees um and so I would encourage you to
 
02:13:06.350 --> 02:13:06.360 align:start position:0%
go to that the pricing laws uh like sub
 
02:13:07.709 --> 02:13:07.719 align:start position:0%
link or whatever we want to call that
 
02:13:10.470 --> 02:13:10.480 align:start position:0%
the link through and and see if that
 
02:13:11.870 --> 02:13:11.880 align:start position:0%
ameliorates any of your concerns and if
 
02:13:13.910 --> 02:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
it doesn't I'm happy to continue to seek
 
02:13:16.270 --> 02:13:16.280 align:start position:0%
other answers for you thank you and you
 
02:13:19.910 --> 02:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
know I I almost think that um some
 
02:13:24.109 --> 02:13:24.119 align:start position:0%
retailers would be happy to sort of um
 
02:13:27.069 --> 02:13:27.079 align:start position:0%
offer this new kind of service for their
 
02:13:31.790 --> 02:13:31.800 align:start position:0%
customers to help them um you know
 
02:13:35.149 --> 02:13:35.159 align:start position:0%
dispose of any paint that they don't use
 
02:13:37.669 --> 02:13:37.679 align:start position:0%
right Madam chair I do agree that this
 
02:13:41.310 --> 02:13:41.320 align:start position:0%
would be a win for retailers that want
 
02:13:44.669 --> 02:13:44.679 align:start position:0%
to participate in this um and I also
 
02:13:46.990 --> 02:13:47.000 align:start position:0%
it's kind of like when we came with the
 
02:13:50.310 --> 02:13:50.320 align:start position:0%
GMO bill right uh everyone wanted us to
 
02:13:52.470 --> 02:13:52.480 align:start position:0%
put it into law but it really ended up
 
02:13:55.669 --> 02:13:55.679 align:start position:0%
being a uh a great advertising
 
02:14:00.270 --> 02:14:00.280 align:start position:0%
tool um for the products that now we see
 
02:14:04.589 --> 02:14:04.599 align:start position:0%
everywhere non GMO um so I think that
 
02:14:09.109 --> 02:14:09.119 align:start position:0%
any store or any paint that is you know
 
02:14:11.189 --> 02:14:11.199 align:start position:0%
advertising that they're participating
 
02:14:16.149 --> 02:14:16.159 align:start position:0%
in this is a winh so um but I'm just
 
02:14:18.229 --> 02:14:18.239 align:start position:0%
looking I'm trying to look at all
 
02:14:21.149 --> 02:14:21.159 align:start position:0%
avenues of it sure and for me as long as
 
02:14:24.790 --> 02:14:24.800 align:start position:0%
we have the the May provision that they
 
02:14:27.350 --> 02:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
may participate as opposed to being
 
02:14:30.790 --> 02:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
compelled to um I think that that's
 
02:14:33.270 --> 02:14:33.280 align:start position:0%
makes it even more attractive because it
 
02:14:35.830 --> 02:14:35.840 align:start position:0%
gives it gives the the retailer the
 
02:14:37.589 --> 02:14:37.599 align:start position:0%
option as to whether or not they want to
 
02:14:39.669 --> 02:14:39.679 align:start position:0%
participate in it because if they don't
 
02:14:42.069 --> 02:14:42.079 align:start position:0%
have the room or they don't have the
 
02:14:44.709 --> 02:14:44.719 align:start position:0%
staff to deal with or whatever you know
 
02:14:46.189 --> 02:14:46.199 align:start position:0%
that's an
 
02:14:49.310 --> 02:14:49.320 align:start position:0%
issue yeah represent Bixby and then
 
02:14:51.830 --> 02:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
confusion yeah so so there are two
 
02:14:55.030 --> 02:14:55.040 align:start position:0%
aspects of participation one aspect is
 
02:14:57.750 --> 02:14:57.760 align:start position:0%
the um being a collection site the other
 
02:15:00.950 --> 02:15:00.960 align:start position:0%
a aspect is uh putting the collecting
 
02:15:04.790 --> 02:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
the fee right and uh in order for I I
 
02:15:07.270 --> 02:15:07.280 align:start position:0%
think in order for it to work we're
 
02:15:09.470 --> 02:15:09.480 align:start position:0%
going to need to have the the fee be a
 
02:15:13.270 --> 02:15:13.280 align:start position:0%
sh because we don't want to have say
 
02:15:16.430 --> 02:15:16.440 align:start position:0%
Home Depot say or say no we're not going
 
02:15:19.350 --> 02:15:19.360 align:start position:0%
to collect the fee uh and then be able
 
02:15:21.629 --> 02:15:21.639 align:start position:0%
to undercut say your local Sherman
 
02:15:24.990 --> 02:15:25.000 align:start position:0%
Williams got so uh and then so then
 
02:15:27.390 --> 02:15:27.400 align:start position:0%
there's the question of okay how much of
 
02:15:30.470 --> 02:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
a burden is going is the remittance of
 
02:15:33.910 --> 02:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
the fee going to be on the retailers and
 
02:15:37.470 --> 02:15:37.480 align:start position:0%
is there any sort of um you know
 
02:15:39.950 --> 02:15:39.960 align:start position:0%
reimbursement for the cost of doing that
 
02:15:43.750 --> 02:15:43.760 align:start position:0%
fee remittance and and you know what
 
02:15:45.430 --> 02:15:45.440 align:start position:0%
what's the what's the what would the
 
02:15:46.950 --> 02:15:46.960 align:start position:0%
level of that cost be if the fee
 
02:15:50.510 --> 02:15:50.520 align:start position:0%
remittance is pretty much um just
 
02:15:53.270 --> 02:15:53.280 align:start position:0%
pushing button then there might not be a
 
02:15:57.990 --> 02:15:58.000 align:start position:0%
need to uh to do that to to have
 
02:15:59.990 --> 02:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
a some sort of a payment to the
 
02:16:02.109 --> 02:16:02.119 align:start position:0%
retailers to do that but if it's going
 
02:16:06.589 --> 02:16:06.599 align:start position:0%
to cause uh an increased accounting load
 
02:16:09.109 --> 02:16:09.119 align:start position:0%
then maybe there needs to be some amount
 
02:16:11.310 --> 02:16:11.320 align:start position:0%
of money that paint care gives to the
 
02:16:12.990 --> 02:16:13.000 align:start position:0%
retailers who are simply collecting the
 
02:16:15.470 --> 02:16:15.480 align:start position:0%
fee in order to do the fee process okay
 
02:16:17.109 --> 02:16:17.119 align:start position:0%
and that might be something that paint
 
02:16:19.430 --> 02:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
care already has worked out it's
 
02:16:20.950 --> 02:16:20.960 align:start position:0%
probably something I have worked out
 
02:16:22.030 --> 02:16:22.040 align:start position:0%
their system because they've done this
 
02:16:24.870 --> 02:16:24.880 align:start position:0%
in like what a couple dozen other states
 
02:16:28.589 --> 02:16:28.599 align:start position:0%
already okay yeah um you and then Howard
 
02:16:31.350 --> 02:16:31.360 align:start position:0%
yeah and and just to piggyback on um
 
02:16:33.750 --> 02:16:33.760 align:start position:0%
Madam chair what representative Bixby
 
02:16:36.950 --> 02:16:36.960 align:start position:0%
just said my only you know once the
 
02:16:39.270 --> 02:16:39.280 align:start position:0%
program is implemented I'm sure the cost
 
02:16:41.750 --> 02:16:41.760 align:start position:0%
to the retailer is going to be minimal
 
02:16:44.110 --> 02:16:44.120 align:start position:0%
my concern is The Upfront cost to the
 
02:16:47.349 --> 02:16:47.359 align:start position:0%
retailer um and what is what is involved
 
02:16:49.950 --> 02:16:49.960 align:start position:0%
with programming and things so just to
 
02:16:52.870 --> 02:16:52.880 align:start position:0%
be clear represent Howard I TR thank you
 
02:16:54.669 --> 02:16:54.679 align:start position:0%
madam chair truthfully mostly most of
 
02:16:57.030 --> 02:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
what representative Bixby said is what
 
02:16:58.509 --> 02:16:58.519 align:start position:0%
um is what I wanted to say but I really
 
02:17:01.750 --> 02:17:01.760 align:start position:0%
do think that if we if we shall if we
 
02:17:03.110 --> 02:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
put shall in front of collecting the
 
02:17:05.270 --> 02:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
fees then then we can't say may because
 
02:17:06.589 --> 02:17:06.599 align:start position:0%
if they're collecting the fees they are
 
02:17:09.110 --> 02:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
participating in the
 
02:17:11.790 --> 02:17:11.800 align:start position:0%
plan I will also just say that I think
 
02:17:15.910 --> 02:17:15.920 align:start position:0%
that um whether or not a to your point
 
02:17:21.270 --> 02:17:21.280 align:start position:0%
and uh if if a an industry excuse EXC me
 
02:17:24.830 --> 02:17:24.840 align:start position:0%
a bigger larger retailer is
 
02:17:27.950 --> 02:17:27.960 align:start position:0%
selling you know 10,000 gallons of paint
 
02:17:30.910 --> 02:17:30.920 align:start position:0%
a month I don't know and they shall
 
02:17:33.150 --> 02:17:33.160 align:start position:0%
collect the fee it is already out there
 
02:17:35.429 --> 02:17:35.439 align:start position:0%
in the waist stream so what do we do
 
02:17:37.230 --> 02:17:37.240 align:start position:0%
with that and I think to representative
 
02:17:39.469 --> 02:17:39.479 align:start position:0%
bixby's point is requiring the
 
02:17:42.669 --> 02:17:42.679 align:start position:0%
collection of the the fee so that when
 
02:17:45.270 --> 02:17:45.280 align:start position:0%
it comes back to wherever it is to be
 
02:17:47.950 --> 02:17:47.960 align:start position:0%
recaptured there is an infrastructure in
 
02:17:49.549 --> 02:17:49.559 align:start position:0%
place to be able to do that and keep it
 
02:17:51.230 --> 02:17:51.240 align:start position:0%
out of the way streams keep keep it out
 
02:17:54.469 --> 02:17:54.479 align:start position:0%
of our you know um tonnage in our
 
02:17:57.030 --> 02:17:57.040 align:start position:0%
landfilling uh hauling fees tipping fees
 
02:17:59.110 --> 02:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
so that's really why I think the
 
02:18:00.910 --> 02:18:00.920 align:start position:0%
distinction I don't want to speak for
 
02:18:02.509 --> 02:18:02.519 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby but that's why I
 
02:18:05.629 --> 02:18:05.639 align:start position:0%
like the distinction of there being a um
 
02:18:08.270 --> 02:18:08.280 align:start position:0%
may be a collection site and shall
 
02:18:10.030 --> 02:18:10.040 align:start position:0%
collect the
 
02:18:13.110 --> 02:18:13.120 align:start position:0%
fee okay representative
 
02:18:15.750 --> 02:18:15.760 align:start position:0%
Dy thank you madam chair I think we're
 
02:18:18.270 --> 02:18:18.280 align:start position:0%
making the assumption that the retail
 
02:18:20.110 --> 02:18:20.120 align:start position:0%
stores are going to be collecting this
 
02:18:22.349 --> 02:18:22.359 align:start position:0%
fee and I'm not sure that that's a
 
02:18:25.389 --> 02:18:25.399 align:start position:0%
correct assumption I think it may be
 
02:18:27.389 --> 02:18:27.399 align:start position:0%
that the fee is baked in at the
 
02:18:32.309 --> 02:18:32.319 align:start position:0%
manufacturer site okay so so let's say
 
02:18:35.270 --> 02:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
um the the can the can of paint costs
 
02:18:40.750 --> 02:18:40.760 align:start position:0%
the retailer $10 okay and $2 of that $10
 
02:18:43.469 --> 02:18:43.479 align:start position:0%
is the recycling fee and so it's the
 
02:18:46.190 --> 02:18:46.200 align:start position:0%
manufacturer who actually makes the
 
02:18:49.589 --> 02:18:49.599 align:start position:0%
payment to paint care okay and all the
 
02:18:52.509 --> 02:18:52.519 align:start position:0%
retailer does is put his his or her
 
02:18:54.790 --> 02:18:54.800 align:start position:0%
markup on it which is what they they do
 
02:18:57.389 --> 02:18:57.399 align:start position:0%
normally so I mean I think that's an
 
02:18:59.950 --> 02:18:59.960 align:start position:0%
assumption that we should clarify
 
02:19:01.509 --> 02:19:01.519 align:start position:0%
because I'm not sure that there's going
 
02:19:06.230 --> 02:19:06.240 align:start position:0%
to be any additional um burden on the
 
02:19:08.629 --> 02:19:08.639 align:start position:0%
retailers for collecting any fee at all
 
02:19:10.389 --> 02:19:10.399 align:start position:0%
I'd like to have that CL get that
 
02:19:13.709 --> 02:19:13.719 align:start position:0%
clarified representative yeah thank you
 
02:19:16.750 --> 02:19:16.760 align:start position:0%
madam chair and I understand represent
 
02:19:18.190 --> 02:19:18.200 align:start position:0%
Dy what you're saying but then the
 
02:19:20.349 --> 02:19:20.359 align:start position:0%
markup becomes on the total cost of the
 
02:19:22.990 --> 02:19:23.000 align:start position:0%
paint normally and so technically there
 
02:19:25.309 --> 02:19:25.319 align:start position:0%
could be an increased fee for uh that
 
02:19:28.910 --> 02:19:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:32.429 --> 02:19:32.439 align:start position:0%
paying a yep your hands up just from my
 
02:19:35.669 --> 02:19:35.679 align:start position:0%
conversations with Vermont the the when
 
02:19:38.150 --> 02:19:38.160 align:start position:0%
you buy a gallon of paint at a retailer
 
02:19:40.990 --> 02:19:41.000 align:start position:0%
it'll show on your receipt $55 per a
 
02:19:44.830 --> 02:19:44.840 align:start position:0%
gallon $2 whatever it is paint care fee
 
02:19:46.190 --> 02:19:46.200 align:start position:0%
or whatever they call it but it it
 
02:19:47.990 --> 02:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
actually shows up on the receipt from
 
02:19:49.990 --> 02:19:50.000 align:start position:0%
the ret retailer that's the way they do
 
02:19:52.349 --> 02:19:52.359 align:start position:0%
it in Vermont anyway
 
02:19:55.830 --> 02:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
okay all right representative Howard
 
02:19:57.670 --> 02:19:57.680 align:start position:0%
just very quickly I just wonder if this
 
02:20:01.110 --> 02:20:01.120 align:start position:0%
won't be perceived as a tax in a state
 
02:20:04.230 --> 02:20:04.240 align:start position:0%
where we resist taxes yeah I can see how
 
02:20:06.910 --> 02:20:06.920 align:start position:0%
it could very clearly be labeled a fee
 
02:20:08.349 --> 02:20:08.359 align:start position:0%
but I just hope that it it doesn't have
 
02:20:09.270 --> 02:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
a bad
 
02:20:12.830 --> 02:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
perception representative Bixby um I
 
02:20:16.590 --> 02:20:16.600 align:start position:0%
think that uh there are people who would
 
02:20:19.429 --> 02:20:19.439 align:start position:0%
probably choose to label it that way we
 
02:20:23.070 --> 02:20:23.080 align:start position:0%
had our dog license is labeled as a tax
 
02:20:27.110 --> 02:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
just last week uh so I but I don't think
 
02:20:31.190 --> 02:20:31.200 align:start position:0%
that but I think that in terms of is
 
02:20:33.910 --> 02:20:33.920 align:start position:0%
this something we should go forward with
 
02:20:36.670 --> 02:20:36.680 align:start position:0%
with because it's a very sensible way of
 
02:20:39.030 --> 02:20:39.040 align:start position:0%
dealing with a problem that is currently
 
02:20:39.040 --> 02:20:40.110 align:start position:0%
dealing with a problem that is currently
causing

02:20:40.110 --> 02:20:40.120 align:start position:0%
causing
 
02:20:45.110 --> 02:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
our uh municipalities to face uh more
 
02:20:47.790 --> 02:20:47.800 align:start position:0%
taxes that go that more costs that go
 
02:20:51.830 --> 02:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
onto our property tax um I think that
 
02:20:53.870 --> 02:20:53.880 align:start position:0%
you're doing that that it's a user fee
 
02:20:57.230 --> 02:20:57.240 align:start position:0%
that is appropriately
 
02:20:57.240 --> 02:20:59.510 align:start position:0%
that is appropriately
distributed

02:20:59.510 --> 02:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
distributed
 
02:21:02.630 --> 02:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
100% I agree 100% I just mentioned that
 
02:21:04.590 --> 02:21:04.600 align:start position:0%
out of an abundance of caution
 
02:21:04.600 --> 02:21:06.230 align:start position:0%
out of an abundance of caution
representative

02:21:06.230 --> 02:21:06.240 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:21:09.710 --> 02:21:09.720 align:start position:0%
kraton it's it's a fair um concern
 
02:21:12.270 --> 02:21:12.280 align:start position:0%
representative Howard I I just uh had a
 
02:21:15.550 --> 02:21:15.560 align:start position:0%
bill go on unanimous consent that added
 
02:21:20.309 --> 02:21:20.319 align:start position:0%
a $3 fee to boat registration and the
 
02:21:23.030 --> 02:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
the reason that it was to pay for the
 
02:21:27.550 --> 02:21:27.560 align:start position:0%
actual sticker and so and so it was a it
 
02:21:29.429 --> 02:21:29.439 align:start position:0%
it was it was considered a fee to pay
 
02:21:31.870 --> 02:21:31.880 align:start position:0%
for an item that you put on your boat
 
02:21:34.950 --> 02:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
and so I think if this is couched in the
 
02:21:37.469 --> 02:21:37.479 align:start position:0%
terms of this is a fee to get rid of the
 
02:21:39.550 --> 02:21:39.560 align:start position:0%
remainder of the paint that you just
 
02:21:42.389 --> 02:21:42.399 align:start position:0%
bought and the cost to the the cost to
 
02:21:45.110 --> 02:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
the town of doing that is not absorbed
 
02:21:48.349 --> 02:21:48.359 align:start position:0%
by taxpayer but by the user then to me
 
02:21:51.349 --> 02:21:51.359 align:start position:0%
that that's a reasonable explanation I
 
02:21:52.590 --> 02:21:52.600 align:start position:0%
again you never know how people are
 
02:21:53.910 --> 02:21:53.920 align:start position:0%
going to take it but that's the way I
 
02:21:57.070 --> 02:21:57.080 align:start position:0%
look at it and I also think if I may
 
02:21:59.550 --> 02:21:59.560 align:start position:0%
Madam sure good that it also provides
 
02:22:02.750 --> 02:22:02.760 align:start position:0%
yet another uh opportunity for these
 
02:22:04.030 --> 02:22:04.040 align:start position:0%
products to not just simply be
 
02:22:06.190 --> 02:22:06.200 align:start position:0%
recaptured but then potentially resold
 
02:22:09.510 --> 02:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
into more affordable paint products that
 
02:22:12.510 --> 02:22:12.520 align:start position:0%
folks of all economic diversity can you
 
02:22:13.950 --> 02:22:13.960 align:start position:0%
know I was just looking at the cost that
 
02:22:16.110 --> 02:22:16.120 align:start position:0%
some of these gallons of paint are
 
02:22:19.870 --> 02:22:19.880 align:start position:0%
$75 so when you're looking at this type
 
02:22:22.750 --> 02:22:22.760 align:start position:0%
of model these are being sold at a
 
02:22:25.670 --> 02:22:25.680 align:start position:0%
fraction of that for repurposed uh
 
02:22:28.830 --> 02:22:28.840 align:start position:0%
paints so
 
02:22:32.550 --> 02:22:32.560 align:start position:0%
yeah okay I think we've uh pretty much
 
02:22:35.030 --> 02:22:35.040 align:start position:0%
exhausted all the con conversation and
 
02:22:37.030 --> 02:22:37.040 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm glad that we've you know talked
 
02:22:40.309 --> 02:22:40.319 align:start position:0%
about a bunch of these things um and so
 
02:22:42.710 --> 02:22:42.720 align:start position:0%
we'll break for lunch and be back here
 
02:22:49.429 --> 02:22:49.439 align:start position:0%

1575

03:08:39.910 --> 03:08:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:44.110 --> 03:08:44.120 align:start position:0%
okay of what okay I'm going to get
 
03:08:49.269 --> 03:08:49.279 align:start position:0%
started with um the hearing for or HB
 
03:08:51.550 --> 03:08:51.560 align:start position:0%
1575 prohibiting the state of New
 
03:08:54.269 --> 03:08:54.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire from enforcing any federal
 
03:08:56.190 --> 03:08:56.200 align:start position:0%
agricultural checkoff
 
03:09:00.190 --> 03:09:00.200 align:start position:0%
program and uh as I look around the room
 
03:09:02.870 --> 03:09:02.880 align:start position:0%
I do not see the sponsor of the bill the
 
03:09:05.830 --> 03:09:05.840 align:start position:0%
sole sponsor of the bill representative
 
03:09:10.190 --> 03:09:10.200 align:start position:0%
Bailey here to introduce the bill so I
 
03:09:14.870 --> 03:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
guess all I'm going to say is that um
 
03:09:16.550 --> 03:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
this bill prohibits the state of New
 
03:09:19.309 --> 03:09:19.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire from en forcing payments for
 
03:09:21.950 --> 03:09:21.960 align:start position:0%
any federal check off program for a
 
03:09:21.960 --> 03:09:23.990 align:start position:0%
any federal check off program for a
agricultural

03:09:23.990 --> 03:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
agricultural
 
03:09:27.229 --> 03:09:27.239 align:start position:0%
Commodities and so what it does is uh
 
03:09:29.710 --> 03:09:29.720 align:start position:0%
apparently it
 
03:09:34.910 --> 03:09:34.920 align:start position:0%
repeals renumbers a section in 425 colon
 
03:09:40.710 --> 03:09:40.720 align:start position:0%
2 it adds uh some sections
 
03:09:43.870 --> 03:09:43.880 align:start position:0%
regarding um the federal check off
 
03:09:43.880 --> 03:09:45.750 align:start position:0%
regarding um the federal check off
program

03:09:45.750 --> 03:09:45.760 align:start position:0%
program
 
03:09:48.030 --> 03:09:48.040 align:start position:0%
fees and
 
03:09:51.229 --> 03:09:51.239 align:start position:0%
adds a bunch of other stuff so I don't
 
03:09:55.910 --> 03:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
really that's all I know about this bill
 
03:09:55.920 --> 03:09:57.550 align:start position:0%
really that's all I know about this bill
um

03:09:57.550 --> 03:09:57.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:10:00.389 --> 03:10:00.399 align:start position:0%
so there is a pink card we do have a
 
03:10:03.550 --> 03:10:03.560 align:start position:0%
pink card coming more pink cards coming
 
03:10:06.070 --> 03:10:06.080 align:start position:0%
but the first person to come and speak
 
03:10:09.469 --> 03:10:09.479 align:start position:0%
to oppose this bill is Robert Johnson
 
03:10:11.110 --> 03:10:11.120 align:start position:0%
from the Farm
 
03:10:14.110 --> 03:10:14.120 align:start position:0%
Bureau welcome to environment and
 
03:10:16.870 --> 03:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
agriculture come and tell us why this
 
03:10:19.910 --> 03:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
bill should not be
 
03:10:22.429 --> 03:10:22.439 align:start position:0%
passed thank thank you madam chair
 
03:10:23.830 --> 03:10:23.840 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
03:10:25.790 --> 03:10:25.800 align:start position:0%
Rob Johnson representing the New
 
03:10:27.630 --> 03:10:27.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Farm the federation's policy
 
03:10:31.269 --> 03:10:31.279 align:start position:0%
director and we do oppose uh House Bill
 
03:10:34.469 --> 03:10:34.479 align:start position:0%
1575 we're not clear really what the
 
03:10:38.389 --> 03:10:38.399 align:start position:0%
intent is uh the the the department and
 
03:10:41.190 --> 03:10:41.200 align:start position:0%
the commissioner will be testifying uh
 
03:10:42.750 --> 03:10:42.760 align:start position:0%
as you keep getting this card now there
 
03:10:45.309 --> 03:10:45.319 align:start position:0%
um they they they do provide office
 
03:10:47.070 --> 03:10:47.080 align:start position:0%
space to Grant a state Dairy promotion
 
03:10:52.309 --> 03:10:52.319 align:start position:0%
which receives check off funds uh what's
 
03:10:54.590 --> 03:10:54.600 align:start position:0%
that strike
 
03:10:57.389 --> 03:10:57.399 align:start position:0%
that okay they did they did they no
 
03:11:00.070 --> 03:11:00.080 align:start position:0%
longer okay so I'm not so again it makes
 
03:11:02.150 --> 03:11:02.160 align:start position:0%
it even more unclear as to what the what
 
03:11:04.790 --> 03:11:04.800 align:start position:0%
the bill does but so you know there the
 
03:11:08.590 --> 03:11:08.600 align:start position:0%
there are I believe it is 21 20 2122
 
03:11:10.469 --> 03:11:10.479 align:start position:0%
Federal check off programs for various
 
03:11:12.790 --> 03:11:12.800 align:start position:0%
Commodities the ones that are farmers
 
03:11:14.910 --> 03:11:14.920 align:start position:0%
participate in New Hampshire at least
 
03:11:16.309 --> 03:11:16.319 align:start position:0%
primarily that I'm aware of would be
 
03:11:18.790 --> 03:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
Dairy there there's also a beef check
 
03:11:20.429 --> 03:11:20.439 align:start position:0%
off there's a Christmas tree check off
 
03:11:21.830 --> 03:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
and I'm probably missing a couple of
 
03:11:24.309 --> 03:11:24.319 align:start position:0%
others but there's all kinds of them uh
 
03:11:26.590 --> 03:11:26.600 align:start position:0%
Across the Nation and these are
 
03:11:29.950 --> 03:11:29.960 align:start position:0%
voluntary programs uh uh that I should
 
03:11:31.670 --> 03:11:31.680 align:start position:0%
say they're they're programs that have
 
03:11:35.349 --> 03:11:35.359 align:start position:0%
been adopted by a majority of of uh
 
03:11:38.750 --> 03:11:38.760 align:start position:0%
participating commodity groups and and
 
03:11:40.790 --> 03:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
um like for the for example the dairy
 
03:11:44.389 --> 03:11:44.399 align:start position:0%
check off uh it's 15 cents of every 100
 
03:11:47.510 --> 03:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
weight of milk sold goes to the check
 
03:11:50.670 --> 03:11:50.680 align:start position:0%
off and Farmers have an opportunity that
 
03:11:53.389 --> 03:11:53.399 align:start position:0%
so much of it goes to the the federal
 
03:11:55.550 --> 03:11:55.560 align:start position:0%
check off uh program and then they can
 
03:11:58.269 --> 03:11:58.279 align:start position:0%
allocate a certain amount of that money
 
03:12:03.110 --> 03:12:03.120 align:start position:0%
and is it five or 10 cents
 
03:12:05.790 --> 03:12:05.800 align:start position:0%
five yeah five to five to Federal then
 
03:12:07.469 --> 03:12:07.479 align:start position:0%
out of the 10 cents they can they can
 
03:12:11.190 --> 03:12:11.200 align:start position:0%
allocate locally and in and again
 
03:12:13.150 --> 03:12:13.160 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong gentleman back
 
03:12:14.750 --> 03:12:14.760 align:start position:0%
there but there's some Dairy Farmers
 
03:12:18.750 --> 03:12:18.760 align:start position:0%
back here uh who and that 10 cents uh
 
03:12:20.550 --> 03:12:20.560 align:start position:0%
they can allocate that to the Granite
 
03:12:22.190 --> 03:12:22.200 align:start position:0%
State Dairy promotion which is inhouse
 
03:12:25.030 --> 03:12:25.040 align:start position:0%
and prior to recently had an office at
 
03:12:26.750 --> 03:12:26.760 align:start position:0%
the Department of Agriculture and there
 
03:12:29.349 --> 03:12:29.359 align:start position:0%
also is a New England Dairy organization
 
03:12:31.469 --> 03:12:31.479 align:start position:0%
that some choose to to send there either
 
03:12:33.550 --> 03:12:33.560 align:start position:0%
five or 10 cents to to and then what
 
03:12:35.750 --> 03:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
they do is they you've seen the gut
 
03:12:38.229 --> 03:12:38.239 align:start position:0%
milk advertis on that that's Dairy
 
03:12:39.870 --> 03:12:39.880 align:start position:0%
promotion money you've seen the beef
 
03:12:42.150 --> 03:12:42.160 align:start position:0%
check off money that that is you know
 
03:12:45.429 --> 03:12:45.439 align:start position:0%
that is uh uh used for for National
 
03:12:47.510 --> 03:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
advertising I believe they Christmas
 
03:12:48.950 --> 03:12:48.960 align:start position:0%
trees I think it's the same thing I
 
03:12:52.229 --> 03:12:52.239 align:start position:0%
think it's 15 cents of every either it's
 
03:12:54.429 --> 03:12:54.439 align:start position:0%
every tree or every dollar to be honest
 
03:12:56.830 --> 03:12:56.840 align:start position:0%
I don't know but again these programs
 
03:13:00.070 --> 03:13:00.080 align:start position:0%
have been approved by a majority of the
 
03:13:02.630 --> 03:13:02.640 align:start position:0%
the producers and they're they're
 
03:13:04.950 --> 03:13:04.960 align:start position:0%
popular and well-received and I guess we
 
03:13:06.950 --> 03:13:06.960 align:start position:0%
again we we're opposed we're not really
 
03:13:08.870 --> 03:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
understanding what what the bill does or
 
03:13:11.190 --> 03:13:11.200 align:start position:0%
why it's being introduced so why do they
 
03:13:13.349 --> 03:13:13.359 align:start position:0%
call it a check off program what it
 
03:13:16.349 --> 03:13:16.359 align:start position:0%
what's I that sort of throws me off
 
03:13:23.590 --> 03:13:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:26.190 --> 03:13:26.200 align:start position:0%
is oh yeah you
 
03:13:31.030 --> 03:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
you dollar Che an S for for for beef
 
03:13:33.070 --> 03:13:33.080 align:start position:0%
when you sell when you sell uh animals
 
03:13:35.349 --> 03:13:35.359 align:start position:0%
for beef yeah there's $1 do that is
 
03:13:37.510 --> 03:13:37.520 align:start position:0%
supposed to go to the into the the
 
03:13:45.469 --> 03:13:45.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:47.550 --> 03:13:47.560 align:start position:0%
program okay
 
03:13:50.990 --> 03:13:51.000 align:start position:0%
and it's something I can say in in in uh
 
03:13:54.429 --> 03:13:54.439 align:start position:0%
as far as the the enforcement of it it's
 
03:13:56.190 --> 03:13:56.200 align:start position:0%
from what I've seen it's it's virtually
 
03:13:57.790 --> 03:13:57.800 align:start position:0%
non-existent at least in this part of
 
03:13:57.800 --> 03:13:59.790 align:start position:0%
non-existent at least in this part of
the

03:13:59.790 --> 03:13:59.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:14:02.790 --> 03:14:02.800 align:start position:0%
country well well I'm saying for for
 
03:14:05.150 --> 03:14:05.160 align:start position:0%
beef for for the for beef I'm sorry for
 
03:14:10.190 --> 03:14:10.200 align:start position:0%
beef yeah so do you know if there
 
03:14:15.190 --> 03:14:15.200 align:start position:0%
are Dairy Farmers or whatever other
 
03:14:16.790 --> 03:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
producers that are involved in these
 
03:14:17.990 --> 03:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
check off
 
03:14:18.000 --> 03:14:19.990 align:start position:0%
check off
programs

03:14:19.990 --> 03:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
programs
 
03:14:20.000 --> 03:14:22.190 align:start position:0%
programs
that

03:14:22.190 --> 03:14:22.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:14:26.150 --> 03:14:26.160 align:start position:0%
um would prefer not
 
03:14:28.990 --> 03:14:29.000 align:start position:0%
to you know give their money I'm sure
 
03:14:32.030 --> 03:14:32.040 align:start position:0%
there are some but it uh it's a I would
 
03:14:34.750 --> 03:14:34.760 align:start position:0%
say a vast minority I mean that there
 
03:14:36.429 --> 03:14:36.439 align:start position:0%
has been a number of court cases over
 
03:14:39.469 --> 03:14:39.479 align:start position:0%
the years uh saying that it is a a
 
03:14:41.070 --> 03:14:41.080 align:start position:0%
violation of their first amendment
 
03:14:44.110 --> 03:14:44.120 align:start position:0%
speech rights um but it it is nothing
 
03:14:46.190 --> 03:14:46.200 align:start position:0%
that I'm aware some at some levels of
 
03:14:48.830 --> 03:14:48.840 align:start position:0%
Court levels that those those uh cases
 
03:14:51.190 --> 03:14:51.200 align:start position:0%
have been successful but on appeal they
 
03:14:53.710 --> 03:14:53.720 align:start position:0%
have not been because I see what this
 
03:14:55.349 --> 03:14:55.359 align:start position:0%
Bill is saying is that you know
 
03:14:57.070 --> 03:14:57.080 align:start position:0%
agricultural producers in the state
 
03:14:59.870 --> 03:14:59.880 align:start position:0%
shall retain the right to choose whether
 
03:15:02.229 --> 03:15:02.239 align:start position:0%
to participate in state level check off
 
03:15:04.510 --> 03:15:04.520 align:start position:0%
programs and shall not be subject to any
 
03:15:07.070 --> 03:15:07.080 align:start position:0%
form of coercion penalty or legal action
 
03:15:09.670 --> 03:15:09.680 align:start position:0%
for opting out of such programs so I
 
03:15:12.469 --> 03:15:12.479 align:start position:0%
guess that's what the the author the
 
03:15:15.510 --> 03:15:15.520 align:start position:0%
sponsor of this bill is is speaking to
 
03:15:17.830 --> 03:15:17.840 align:start position:0%
is the fact that there are people who
 
03:15:21.750 --> 03:15:21.760 align:start position:0%
are compelled to write this check for
 
03:15:24.309 --> 03:15:24.319 align:start position:0%
whatever transaction uh against their
 
03:15:26.830 --> 03:15:26.840 align:start position:0%
will so to speak if there are any in New
 
03:15:28.870 --> 03:15:28.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that are vehemently opposed
 
03:15:30.269 --> 03:15:30.279 align:start position:0%
they certainly haven't been in touch
 
03:15:32.269 --> 03:15:32.279 align:start position:0%
with me
 
03:15:34.630 --> 03:15:34.640 align:start position:0%
okay all right any other questions from
 
03:15:34.640 --> 03:15:35.510 align:start position:0%
okay all right any other questions from
the

03:15:35.510 --> 03:15:35.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:15:37.990 --> 03:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you thank
 
03:15:39.309 --> 03:15:39.319 align:start position:0%
you I hope that's helpful I was not
 
03:15:41.630 --> 03:15:41.640 align:start position:0%
prepared to speak today thank you
 
03:15:46.030 --> 03:15:46.040 align:start position:0%
appreciate it um so I will now call uh
 
03:15:47.910 --> 03:15:47.920 align:start position:0%
commissioner Shan asper from Department
 
03:15:51.349 --> 03:15:51.359 align:start position:0%
of Agriculture to speak on HB
 
03:15:55.110 --> 03:15:55.120 align:start position:0%
1575 and he opposes this bill as well I
 
03:15:57.550 --> 03:15:57.560 align:start position:0%
do Madame chair thank you members of the
 
03:15:59.990 --> 03:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
committee I am Shan Jasper commissioner
 
03:16:01.349 --> 03:16:01.359 align:start position:0%
of the Department of Agriculture markets
 
03:16:04.070 --> 03:16:04.080 align:start position:0%
and food I will tell you that I made um
 
03:16:06.750 --> 03:16:06.760 align:start position:0%
numerous attempts to contact the sponsor
 
03:16:10.229 --> 03:16:10.239 align:start position:0%
to have a conversation but he uh
 
03:16:13.030 --> 03:16:13.040 align:start position:0%
declined to respond to any of my
 
03:16:16.429 --> 03:16:16.439 align:start position:0%
attempts to communicate with him um so I
 
03:16:17.950 --> 03:16:17.960 align:start position:0%
don't have the benefit of knowing what
 
03:16:20.750 --> 03:16:20.760 align:start position:0%
he was thinking of but um first of all
 
03:16:22.990 --> 03:16:23.000 align:start position:0%
there seems to be two different things
 
03:16:24.429 --> 03:16:24.439 align:start position:0%
he's talking about here one is the
 
03:16:26.830 --> 03:16:26.840 align:start position:0%
federal check off program which there
 
03:16:31.990 --> 03:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
are dozens several dozen um of and then
 
03:16:34.030 --> 03:16:34.040 align:start position:0%
it's talking about state check off
 
03:16:37.389 --> 03:16:37.399 align:start position:0%
programs which we don't have any so
 
03:16:39.429 --> 03:16:39.439 align:start position:0%
first of all I would tell you that in
 
03:16:42.670 --> 03:16:42.680 align:start position:0%
order for the Department to ever enforce
 
03:16:44.469 --> 03:16:44.479 align:start position:0%
the federal check off program three
 
03:16:47.710 --> 03:16:47.720 align:start position:0%
things would have to happen one there
 
03:16:49.469 --> 03:16:49.479 align:start position:0%
would have to be legislation at the
 
03:16:52.510 --> 03:16:52.520 align:start position:0%
federal level asking the states to
 
03:16:56.110 --> 03:16:56.120 align:start position:0%
participate in enforcing it two the
 
03:16:58.309 --> 03:16:58.319 align:start position:0%
state legislature would have to give a
 
03:16:59.950 --> 03:16:59.960 align:start position:0%
directive to the Department of
 
03:17:03.950 --> 03:17:03.960 align:start position:0%
Agriculture to help enforce the programs
 
03:17:06.790 --> 03:17:06.800 align:start position:0%
and three you would have to mandate that
 
03:17:10.189 --> 03:17:10.199 align:start position:0%
there be a Statewide registry of animals
 
03:17:13.389 --> 03:17:13.399 align:start position:0%
in in sales so that I would
 
03:17:17.990 --> 03:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
know what um commodity were being sold
 
03:17:19.990 --> 03:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
so that I could help enforce that so
 
03:17:22.710 --> 03:17:22.720 align:start position:0%
none of those things are likely to
 
03:17:24.870 --> 03:17:24.880 align:start position:0%
happen but certainly all three are
 
03:17:26.550 --> 03:17:26.560 align:start position:0%
certainly not going to happen I'm sure
 
03:17:28.389 --> 03:17:28.399 align:start position:0%
the the latter of the two would not
 
03:17:30.590 --> 03:17:30.600 align:start position:0%
happen in in the state of New Hampshire
 
03:17:33.070 --> 03:17:33.080 align:start position:0%
and I would certainly oppose that these
 
03:17:36.229 --> 03:17:36.239 align:start position:0%
are federal programs so don't confuse
 
03:17:36.239 --> 03:17:37.110 align:start position:0%
are federal programs so don't confuse
you

03:17:37.110 --> 03:17:37.120 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:17:40.309 --> 03:17:40.319 align:start position:0%
know the the issue of state and federal
 
03:17:41.950 --> 03:17:41.960 align:start position:0%
because the second page talks about a
 
03:17:43.870 --> 03:17:43.880 align:start position:0%
state program which doesn't
 
03:17:46.510 --> 03:17:46.520 align:start position:0%
exist um so yeah people might not want
 
03:17:48.630 --> 03:17:48.640 align:start position:0%
to participate in that which doesn't
 
03:17:51.150 --> 03:17:51.160 align:start position:0%
exist and I would not encourage that
 
03:17:55.710 --> 03:17:55.720 align:start position:0%
either um but this bill is wholly
 
03:17:59.030 --> 03:17:59.040 align:start position:0%
unnecessary because there are no current
 
03:18:01.469 --> 03:18:01.479 align:start position:0%
mechanisms in place for the Department
 
03:18:03.870 --> 03:18:03.880 align:start position:0%
of Agriculture to
 
03:18:06.910 --> 03:18:06.920 align:start position:0%
enforce um this so we're
 
03:18:09.590 --> 03:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
asking the bill asks us to do something
 
03:18:13.389 --> 03:18:13.399 align:start position:0%
that can't be done say don't do what you
 
03:18:17.349 --> 03:18:17.359 align:start position:0%
can't do okay okay any glad to answer
 
03:18:21.670 --> 03:18:21.680 align:start position:0%
any questions any questions
 
03:18:24.510 --> 03:18:24.520 align:start position:0%
um okay so there there are no State
 
03:18:24.520 --> 03:18:26.030 align:start position:0%
um okay so there there are no State
checkoff

03:18:26.030 --> 03:18:26.040 align:start position:0%
checkoff
 
03:18:29.630 --> 03:18:29.640 align:start position:0%
programs and um the federal programs we
 
03:18:31.309 --> 03:18:31.319 align:start position:0%
really can't do we don't have any
 
03:18:32.910 --> 03:18:32.920 align:start position:0%
control over
 
03:18:32.920 --> 03:18:34.590 align:start position:0%
control over
anyway

03:18:34.590 --> 03:18:34.600 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
03:18:37.229 --> 03:18:37.239 align:start position:0%
okay yeah it would take a it would take
 
03:18:39.830 --> 03:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
some sort of a Cooperative agreement but
 
03:18:41.510 --> 03:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
I would the department would need
 
03:18:43.990 --> 03:18:44.000 align:start position:0%
authoriz authorization from the state to
 
03:18:45.710 --> 03:18:45.720 align:start position:0%
do that to begin
 
03:18:49.110 --> 03:18:49.120 align:start position:0%
with okay representative ktoa thank you
 
03:18:50.550 --> 03:18:50.560 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you commissioner
 
03:18:52.389 --> 03:18:52.399 align:start position:0%
for being here can you speak to us a
 
03:18:54.150 --> 03:18:54.160 align:start position:0%
little bit about the granted State Dairy
 
03:18:57.110 --> 03:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
promotion program and how that works
 
03:18:59.990 --> 03:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
sure um to a to a small degree and I
 
03:19:02.870 --> 03:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
know you do have some testimony from Amy
 
03:19:05.110 --> 03:19:05.120 align:start position:0%
Hall the executive director so the
 
03:19:07.590 --> 03:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
federal check off level uh as you've
 
03:19:09.950 --> 03:19:09.960 align:start position:0%
heard there are there's money that goes
 
03:19:12.630 --> 03:19:12.640 align:start position:0%
to to the federal program 5 cents 100
 
03:19:16.110 --> 03:19:16.120 align:start position:0%
weight I believe and then 10 cents which
 
03:19:19.550 --> 03:19:19.560 align:start position:0%
farmers can direct that 10 cents to
 
03:19:22.750 --> 03:19:22.760 align:start position:0%
wherever they want um and I don't know
 
03:19:25.429 --> 03:19:25.439 align:start position:0%
if this is still going on but for a
 
03:19:28.229 --> 03:19:28.239 align:start position:0%
while there was a Florida farmer who
 
03:19:29.349 --> 03:19:29.359 align:start position:0%
liked what we were doing in New
 
03:19:33.429 --> 03:19:33.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and he was directing his check
 
03:19:36.870 --> 03:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
off money his his uh 10 cents or at
 
03:19:38.710 --> 03:19:38.720 align:start position:0%
least a portion of that to come to New
 
03:19:41.469 --> 03:19:41.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to support our program so
 
03:19:44.070 --> 03:19:44.080 align:start position:0%
that's they get to decide so there are
 
03:19:45.630 --> 03:19:45.640 align:start position:0%
two really that
 
03:19:48.590 --> 03:19:48.600 align:start position:0%
cover um New Hampshire one is Granite
 
03:19:50.349 --> 03:19:50.359 align:start position:0%
State Dairy and the other is a more
 
03:19:52.150 --> 03:19:52.160 align:start position:0%
Regional one I can't recall the name of
 
03:19:55.389 --> 03:19:55.399 align:start position:0%
it not involved in that um but so some
 
03:19:57.389 --> 03:19:57.399 align:start position:0%
producers do have or did have their
 
03:20:00.750 --> 03:20:00.760 align:start position:0%
money going to the the regional program
 
03:20:03.030 --> 03:20:03.040 align:start position:0%
where most have their money going to
 
03:20:05.590 --> 03:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
Grand estate Dairy
 
03:20:08.510 --> 03:20:08.520 align:start position:0%
promotion okay any other questions from
 
03:20:08.520 --> 03:20:09.910 align:start position:0%
promotion okay any other questions from
the

03:20:09.910 --> 03:20:09.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:20:12.670 --> 03:20:12.680 align:start position:0%
committee oh and and if I could I would
 
03:20:17.630 --> 03:20:17.640 align:start position:0%
say that is the one that is easy to be
 
03:20:21.750 --> 03:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
um uh funded because that those go
 
03:20:24.750 --> 03:20:24.760 align:start position:0%
through the uh through the milk co-ops
 
03:20:26.950 --> 03:20:26.960 align:start position:0%
so that money is taken out at that level
 
03:20:28.710 --> 03:20:28.720 align:start position:0%
and sent from the co-ops to where it's
 
03:20:31.229 --> 03:20:31.239 align:start position:0%
being directed so with beef it would be
 
03:20:33.110 --> 03:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
the individual with pork it would be the
 
03:20:35.030 --> 03:20:35.040 align:start position:0%
individuals other Commodities would be
 
03:20:38.110 --> 03:20:38.120 align:start position:0%
the responsibility of the individuals I
 
03:20:40.229 --> 03:20:40.239 align:start position:0%
I and that would really from what I know
 
03:20:42.750 --> 03:20:42.760 align:start position:0%
is truly uh voluntary because I don't
 
03:20:44.510 --> 03:20:44.520 align:start position:0%
think the feds have any idea who's
 
03:20:46.790 --> 03:20:46.800 align:start position:0%
producing what you know out in the mid
 
03:20:49.349 --> 03:20:49.359 align:start position:0%
West where you're producing you know
 
03:20:51.790 --> 03:20:51.800 align:start position:0%
thousands of animals it's pretty easy to
 
03:20:53.590 --> 03:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
to get to that and determine but in New
 
03:20:55.710 --> 03:20:55.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I have not heard of any any
 
03:21:00.110 --> 03:21:00.120 align:start position:0%
problems at all or complaints okay all
 
03:21:01.630 --> 03:21:01.640 align:start position:0%
right well thank you very much
 
03:21:15.550 --> 03:21:15.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:15.560 --> 03:21:21.150 align:start position:0%
 
Robertson

03:21:21.150 --> 03:21:21.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:23.790 --> 03:21:23.800 align:start position:0%
uh hi I'm Jamie Robertson and uh my
 
03:21:26.229 --> 03:21:26.239 align:start position:0%
family owns uh Bohanan Farm over in
 
03:21:28.750 --> 03:21:28.760 align:start position:0%
Hopkinton New Hampshire and we're also k
 
03:21:28.760 --> 03:21:30.429 align:start position:0%
Hopkinton New Hampshire and we're also k
creery

03:21:30.429 --> 03:21:30.439 align:start position:0%
creery
 
03:21:33.349 --> 03:21:33.359 align:start position:0%
um I think the commissioner sum things
 
03:21:35.910 --> 03:21:35.920 align:start position:0%
up pretty well and Rob before that but
 
03:21:38.630 --> 03:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
if you had any any uh questions for a
 
03:21:40.550 --> 03:21:40.560 align:start position:0%
Dairy Farmer themselves I am one of
 
03:21:43.189 --> 03:21:43.199 align:start position:0%
those um the the one thing I would say
 
03:21:45.670 --> 03:21:45.680 align:start position:0%
is that we are independent from a co-op
 
03:21:47.550 --> 03:21:47.560 align:start position:0%
because we process all of our own milk
 
03:21:49.469 --> 03:21:49.479 align:start position:0%
and the commissioner is right that the
 
03:21:51.830 --> 03:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
co-ops take care of if you ship your
 
03:21:54.070 --> 03:21:54.080 align:start position:0%
milk to either like the hood plant or
 
03:21:56.070 --> 03:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
agramar for cabbat cheese stuff like
 
03:21:58.790 --> 03:21:58.800 align:start position:0%
that that's all handled on the by the
 
03:22:01.469 --> 03:22:01.479 align:start position:0%
co-op offices and gets deducted out of
 
03:22:03.550 --> 03:22:03.560 align:start position:0%
the milk check that we get sent back to
 
03:22:06.269 --> 03:22:06.279 align:start position:0%
Dairy Farmers um we're a little
 
03:22:07.870 --> 03:22:07.880 align:start position:0%
different because we process all our own
 
03:22:09.830 --> 03:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
milk so we have to keep track of that
 
03:22:12.590 --> 03:22:12.600 align:start position:0%
and we have to report how much milk we
 
03:22:14.590 --> 03:22:14.600 align:start position:0%
process to the federal Market
 
03:22:17.590 --> 03:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
administrator in Boston and then they
 
03:22:19.950 --> 03:22:19.960 align:start position:0%
report that to the National milk
 
03:22:22.349 --> 03:22:22.359 align:start position:0%
promotion folks in Chicago and we get a
 
03:22:26.110 --> 03:22:26.120 align:start position:0%
bill from Chicago to pay 15 cents for
 
03:22:28.070 --> 03:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
every 100 pounds of milk we sell that's
 
03:22:29.910 --> 03:22:29.920 align:start position:0%
how that's how milk's always classified
 
03:22:32.309 --> 03:22:32.319 align:start position:0%
as 100 pounds but and then you can
 
03:22:34.750 --> 03:22:34.760 align:start position:0%
choose five five cents has to go to the
 
03:22:36.870 --> 03:22:36.880 align:start position:0%
National and then you can choose for 10
 
03:22:38.349 --> 03:22:38.359 align:start position:0%
cents either to go to Granite State
 
03:22:40.229 --> 03:22:40.239 align:start position:0%
Dairy promotion which is still a federal
 
03:22:42.510 --> 03:22:42.520 align:start position:0%
program but it's it's a regional federal
 
03:22:44.510 --> 03:22:44.520 align:start position:0%
program just for New Hampshire run by
 
03:22:47.150 --> 03:22:47.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Dairy Farmers and then the
 
03:22:49.070 --> 03:22:49.080 align:start position:0%
other oh you can either send your 10
 
03:22:50.910 --> 03:22:50.920 align:start position:0%
cents there or you can send your 10
 
03:22:53.670 --> 03:22:53.680 align:start position:0%
cents to the uh New England Dairy
 
03:22:57.189 --> 03:22:57.199 align:start position:0%
promotion which is not every state has a
 
03:22:59.469 --> 03:22:59.479 align:start position:0%
Granite State Dairy promotion um not
 
03:23:02.110 --> 03:23:02.120 align:start position:0%
every state has their own private Dairy
 
03:23:05.630 --> 03:23:05.640 align:start position:0%
promotion arm of the federal program um
 
03:23:07.349 --> 03:23:07.359 align:start position:0%
and so that covers all of New England
 
03:23:08.870 --> 03:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
and you have your choice of where that
 
03:23:12.150 --> 03:23:12.160 align:start position:0%
10 cents goes um and as far as the beef
 
03:23:15.750 --> 03:23:15.760 align:start position:0%
check off we do get um most of us Dairy
 
03:23:19.309 --> 03:23:19.319 align:start position:0%
Farmers we sell our our C cows we call
 
03:23:21.070 --> 03:23:21.080 align:start position:0%
them when they're done milking go to a
 
03:23:24.150 --> 03:23:24.160 align:start position:0%
sail Barn um and there is a beef check
 
03:23:25.710 --> 03:23:25.720 align:start position:0%
off is done at the sale barn and
 
03:23:27.550 --> 03:23:27.560 align:start position:0%
deducted from our check before we get
 
03:23:30.429 --> 03:23:30.439 align:start position:0%
our check back from the sailb barn there
 
03:23:35.550 --> 03:23:35.560 align:start position:0%
okay so my question to you is what is it
 
03:23:37.910 --> 03:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
so what is this total what is the this
 
03:23:41.070 --> 03:23:41.080 align:start position:0%
amount to say on a monthly basis or a
 
03:23:44.110 --> 03:23:44.120 align:start position:0%
yearly basis what how much do you have
 
03:23:47.790 --> 03:23:47.800 align:start position:0%
to deduct off your
 
03:23:50.790 --> 03:23:50.800 align:start position:0%
product it ends up being a
 
03:23:53.229 --> 03:23:53.239 align:start position:0%
fairly let me pull out my calculator
 
03:23:53.239 --> 03:23:55.150 align:start position:0%
fairly let me pull out my calculator
here

03:23:55.150 --> 03:23:55.160 align:start position:0%
here
 
03:23:55.160 --> 03:24:07.070 align:start position:0%
here
sorry

03:24:07.070 --> 03:24:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:10.750 --> 03:24:10.760 align:start position:0%
where so for us it's um we're shipping
 
03:24:12.510 --> 03:24:12.520 align:start position:0%
about a quarter of a million pounds of
 
03:24:15.189 --> 03:24:15.199 align:start position:0%
milk a month which is fairly small for
 
03:24:18.189 --> 03:24:18.199 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire not tiny by any means but
 
03:24:21.950 --> 03:24:21.960 align:start position:0%
um and that's just under $400 a month
 
03:24:23.670 --> 03:24:23.680 align:start position:0%
okay I mean it's
 
03:24:27.389 --> 03:24:27.399 align:start position:0%
not um we spend a lot more ourselves now
 
03:24:30.870 --> 03:24:30.880 align:start position:0%
marketing our own brand um but that's
 
03:24:33.309 --> 03:24:33.319 align:start position:0%
you know and this is separate from it's
 
03:24:37.429 --> 03:24:37.439 align:start position:0%
not marketing like Hood milk or um I I
 
03:24:40.150 --> 03:24:40.160 align:start position:0%
don't not that goes back 40 years hood
 
03:24:42.990 --> 03:24:43.000 align:start position:0%
or um you know it doesn't Market name
 
03:24:46.110 --> 03:24:46.120 align:start position:0%
brand milk it just markets milk as a
 
03:24:47.870 --> 03:24:47.880 align:start position:0%
whole and it also does a lot of research
 
03:24:49.950 --> 03:24:49.960 align:start position:0%
for new products and things like that
 
03:24:52.830 --> 03:24:52.840 align:start position:0%
also and so and for that
 
03:24:55.269 --> 03:24:55.279 align:start position:0%
$400 what do you feel that you get back
 
03:24:57.670 --> 03:24:57.680 align:start position:0%
in return I'm one who believes in the
 
03:24:59.830 --> 03:24:59.840 align:start position:0%
program I believe that that that we
 
03:25:01.429 --> 03:25:01.439 align:start position:0%
aren't paying enough in advertising
 
03:25:05.790 --> 03:25:05.800 align:start position:0%
personally but I I don't know that I'm
 
03:25:08.269 --> 03:25:08.279 align:start position:0%
uh I guess I wouldn't say that that's
 
03:25:11.510 --> 03:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
probably the common thought of folks um
 
03:25:14.110 --> 03:25:14.120 align:start position:0%
but I think that uh if you look at what
 
03:25:16.469 --> 03:25:16.479 align:start position:0%
other beverage Industries put in into
 
03:25:18.990 --> 03:25:19.000 align:start position:0%
advertising I think 15 cents 100 weight
 
03:25:21.070 --> 03:25:21.080 align:start position:0%
is is a pretty nominal amount of money
 
03:25:23.550 --> 03:25:23.560 align:start position:0%
to invest in in advertising in new
 
03:25:23.560 --> 03:25:24.790 align:start position:0%
to invest in in advertising in new
product

03:25:24.790 --> 03:25:24.800 align:start position:0%
product
 
03:25:28.349 --> 03:25:28.359 align:start position:0%
development okay and so for the beef end
 
03:25:30.429 --> 03:25:30.439 align:start position:0%
what what kinds of services do they
 
03:25:32.990 --> 03:25:33.000 align:start position:0%
provide for you for that uh same uh beef
 
03:25:35.150 --> 03:25:35.160 align:start position:0%
what's for dinner okay that that kind of
 
03:25:37.469 --> 03:25:37.479 align:start position:0%
um James Garner used to do their ads you
 
03:25:39.750 --> 03:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
know so that that's
 
03:25:43.070 --> 03:25:43.080 align:start position:0%
um yeah and same thing I think that
 
03:25:46.510 --> 03:25:46.520 align:start position:0%
Megan uh I'm sorry representative Murray
 
03:25:48.469 --> 03:25:48.479 align:start position:0%
okay God no it's all right thanks Madam
 
03:25:52.150 --> 03:25:52.160 align:start position:0%
chair um so I I I did have a question
 
03:25:53.830 --> 03:25:53.840 align:start position:0%
and I can't remember and maybe this is a
 
03:25:56.510 --> 03:25:56.520 align:start position:0%
question for commissioner Jasper if I
 
03:25:59.110 --> 03:25:59.120 align:start position:0%
remember are value added products
 
03:26:02.510 --> 03:26:02.520 align:start position:0%
included in the 10 cents or is it just
 
03:26:05.670 --> 03:26:05.680 align:start position:0%
liquid so it's it's just
 
03:26:05.680 --> 03:26:08.349 align:start position:0%
liquid so it's it's just
on

03:26:08.349 --> 03:26:08.359 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:26:11.950 --> 03:26:11.960 align:start position:0%
the well raw milk that goes from it it's
 
03:26:14.830 --> 03:26:14.840 align:start position:0%
on it's on the farmer side of things we
 
03:26:16.950 --> 03:26:16.960 align:start position:0%
have the check off that's just at farm
 
03:26:20.429 --> 03:26:20.439 align:start position:0%
farm gate I would say
 
03:26:26.349 --> 03:26:26.359 align:start position:0%
um I guess probably I don't know of any
 
03:26:29.110 --> 03:26:29.120 align:start position:0%
um cut off where if you ship under x
 
03:26:31.429 --> 03:26:31.439 align:start position:0%
amount you're not charged um I think
 
03:26:33.309 --> 03:26:33.319 align:start position:0%
probably like the commissioner said
 
03:26:35.189 --> 03:26:35.199 align:start position:0%
there isn't a tremendous amount of
 
03:26:38.469 --> 03:26:38.479 align:start position:0%
oversight on people that aren't um we
 
03:26:40.309 --> 03:26:40.319 align:start position:0%
big enough so that the federal Market
 
03:26:42.790 --> 03:26:42.800 align:start position:0%
administrator follows us um and wants to
 
03:26:46.030 --> 03:26:46.040 align:start position:0%
know how much milk we sell um so I guess
 
03:26:47.950 --> 03:26:47.960 align:start position:0%
if if you had a couple of cows maybe
 
03:26:50.830 --> 03:26:50.840 align:start position:0%
you're supposed to pay for it but but
 
03:26:52.710 --> 03:26:52.720 align:start position:0%
probably no one's checking up on you
 
03:26:54.550 --> 03:26:54.560 align:start position:0%
right any other questions represented
 
03:26:57.510 --> 03:26:57.520 align:start position:0%
Duty thank you madam chair are uh is
 
03:27:00.870 --> 03:27:00.880 align:start position:0%
your brand name kukut Kuka creary yes
 
03:27:03.309 --> 03:27:03.319 align:start position:0%
KET crey okay so I just want to put in a
 
03:27:06.389 --> 03:27:06.399 align:start position:0%
plug when you go to your store because I
 
03:27:08.910 --> 03:27:08.920 align:start position:0%
always try to buy KET creary but it's
 
03:27:10.269 --> 03:27:10.279 align:start position:0%
not always
 
03:27:13.030 --> 03:27:13.040 align:start position:0%
available um but I really think I
 
03:27:15.349 --> 03:27:15.359 align:start position:0%
noticed the difference so and and and
 
03:27:18.910 --> 03:27:18.920 align:start position:0%
just the fact that we can support a farm
 
03:27:20.670 --> 03:27:20.680 align:start position:0%
you know that we know all the milk is
 
03:27:22.990 --> 03:27:23.000 align:start position:0%
coming from New Hampshire is really
 
03:27:25.429 --> 03:27:25.439 align:start position:0%
exciting but I will ask you why do you
 
03:27:28.710 --> 03:27:28.720 align:start position:0%
not have 2% milk I haven't seen it in
 
03:27:31.710 --> 03:27:31.720 align:start position:0%
the store you're right um we have we
 
03:27:35.950 --> 03:27:35.960 align:start position:0%
have uh low fat which is kind of 1% um
 
03:27:37.710 --> 03:27:37.720 align:start position:0%
and and that's a blue label so we do
 
03:27:39.630 --> 03:27:39.640 align:start position:0%
have a low fat but it might not be at
 
03:27:41.750 --> 03:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
your store
 
03:27:45.389 --> 03:27:45.399 align:start position:0%
um mainly uh the milk consumption has
 
03:27:47.790 --> 03:27:47.800 align:start position:0%
changed drastically in the last 15 years
 
03:27:50.309 --> 03:27:50.319 align:start position:0%
and um and there isn't a huge market for
 
03:27:53.429 --> 03:27:53.439 align:start position:0%
the lower fat milks that's um
 
03:27:55.309 --> 03:27:55.319 align:start position:0%
unfortunately a lot of that is switched
 
03:27:58.870 --> 03:27:58.880 align:start position:0%
over to um
 
03:28:02.030 --> 03:28:02.040 align:start position:0%
melt non-melt
 
03:28:05.349 --> 03:28:05.359 align:start position:0%
milks all right non milk beverages I
 
03:28:06.550 --> 03:28:06.560 align:start position:0%
call them something but it's not
 
03:28:06.560 --> 03:28:07.130 align:start position:0%
call them something but it's not
appropriate

03:28:07.130 --> 03:28:07.140 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
03:28:07.140 --> 03:28:09.349 align:start position:0%
appropriate
[Laughter]

03:28:09.349 --> 03:28:09.359 align:start position:0%

did so we will wait for a
 
03:29:41.990 --> 03:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
second oh now we have a quorum now we
 
03:29:44.269 --> 03:29:44.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:47.550 --> 03:29:47.560 align:start position:0%
quorum what my Green Sheet your green
 
03:29:50.510 --> 03:29:50.520 align:start position:0%
sheet oh
 
03:29:54.990 --> 03:29:55.000 align:start position:0%
okay all right um so I I guess we have
 
03:29:57.790 --> 03:29:57.800 align:start position:0%
decided to exec this bill now we have
 
03:30:00.510 --> 03:30:00.520 align:start position:0%
some time actually and I will open up
 
03:30:04.030 --> 03:30:04.040 align:start position:0%
the exec session for HB
 
03:30:06.429 --> 03:30:06.439 align:start position:0%
1575 uh prohibiting the state of New
 
03:30:08.070 --> 03:30:08.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire from enforcing any federal
 
03:30:10.469 --> 03:30:10.479 align:start position:0%
agricultural check off program do I hear
 
03:30:12.469 --> 03:30:12.479 align:start position:0%
a motion does anyone want practice
 
03:30:14.950 --> 03:30:14.960 align:start position:0%
writing a blur I got
 
03:30:14.960 --> 03:30:16.830 align:start position:0%
writing a blur I got
two

03:30:16.830 --> 03:30:16.840 align:start position:0%
two
 
03:30:20.710 --> 03:30:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:26.349 --> 03:30:26.359 align:start position:0%
it represent CLK oh but oh go ahead oh
 
03:30:28.269 --> 03:30:28.279 align:start position:0%
you're on you're good go ahead
 
03:30:30.269 --> 03:30:30.279 align:start position:0%
representative smart you can do it good
 
03:30:34.630 --> 03:30:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:37.630 --> 03:30:37.640 align:start position:0%
moveed so what do I do me I make a
 
03:30:42.910 --> 03:30:42.920 align:start position:0%
motion to to what it itl this bill okay
 
03:30:46.349 --> 03:30:46.359 align:start position:0%
I'm represent Duty seconds I second it
 
03:30:48.389 --> 03:30:48.399 align:start position:0%
and representative smart might you want
 
03:30:52.510 --> 03:30:52.520 align:start position:0%
to speak to your motion I do yeah just
 
03:30:56.309 --> 03:30:56.319 align:start position:0%
say um why why this bill should be ited
 
03:30:57.990 --> 03:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
I don't really completely understand
 
03:30:58.000 --> 03:31:00.389 align:start position:0%
I don't really completely understand
this

03:31:00.389 --> 03:31:00.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:03.070 --> 03:31:03.080 align:start position:0%
bill I guess it should be it because
 
03:31:05.630 --> 03:31:05.640 align:start position:0%
they all wanted itl how's that good
 
03:31:07.910 --> 03:31:07.920 align:start position:0%
reason that's a good enough reason any
 
03:31:09.950 --> 03:31:09.960 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Bixby well I
 
03:31:12.189 --> 03:31:12.199 align:start position:0%
think that uh we have a couple of a
 
03:31:15.590 --> 03:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
couple of clear no clear indicators one
 
03:31:17.269 --> 03:31:17.279 align:start position:0%
one is is and you might want to be
 
03:31:18.349 --> 03:31:18.359 align:start position:0%
taking notes because you're going to be
 
03:31:20.710 --> 03:31:20.720 align:start position:0%
writing the report on
 
03:31:24.469 --> 03:31:24.479 align:start position:0%
this so uh one issue was that the uh
 
03:31:26.510 --> 03:31:26.520 align:start position:0%
Prime sponsor did not show up to explain
 
03:31:27.510 --> 03:31:27.520 align:start position:0%
it to
 
03:31:31.030 --> 03:31:31.040 align:start position:0%
us and the reason for the bill was not
 
03:31:33.189 --> 03:31:33.199 align:start position:0%
clear and
 
03:31:35.990 --> 03:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
the uh second reason is that the
 
03:31:39.550 --> 03:31:39.560 align:start position:0%
commissioner let us know that the
 
03:31:42.309 --> 03:31:42.319 align:start position:0%
department currently has the state has
 
03:31:44.429 --> 03:31:44.439 align:start position:0%
currently has no power to enforce
 
03:31:46.309 --> 03:31:46.319 align:start position:0%
anything about the check off program at
 
03:31:48.510 --> 03:31:48.520 align:start position:0%
the federal level and there is no check
 
03:31:52.550 --> 03:31:52.560 align:start position:0%
off program at the state level so it's
 
03:31:55.710 --> 03:31:55.720 align:start position:0%
pointless representative kamwa thank you
 
03:31:58.309 --> 03:31:58.319 align:start position:0%
madam chair and they have really good
 
03:32:03.349 --> 03:32:03.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:06.110 --> 03:32:06.120 align:start position:0%
milk representative kraton and the other
 
03:32:07.510 --> 03:32:07.520 align:start position:0%
the other thing that I would add was
 
03:32:09.269 --> 03:32:09.279 align:start position:0%
that the Farm Bureau came out against it
 
03:32:09.279 --> 03:32:12.910 align:start position:0%
that the Farm Bureau came out against it
as

03:32:12.910 --> 03:32:12.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:15.670 --> 03:32:15.680 align:start position:0%
well okay there's any other discussion
 
03:32:19.950 --> 03:32:19.960 align:start position:0%
on this bill um then I would ask the
 
03:32:21.870 --> 03:32:21.880 align:start position:0%
clerk to call the role please thank you
 
03:32:24.510 --> 03:32:24.520 align:start position:0%

03:33:41.349 --> 03:33:41.359 align:start position:0%
bill and I will turn over the mic to my
 
03:33:44.710 --> 03:33:44.720 align:start position:0%
esteemed colleague representative
 
03:33:44.720 --> 03:34:03.269 align:start position:0%
esteemed colleague representative
kraton

03:34:03.269 --> 03:34:03.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:06.349 --> 03:34:06.359 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to open a hearing on HB
 
03:34:09.429 --> 03:34:09.439 align:start position:0%
1698 and I call Representative Aaron to
 
03:34:10.510 --> 03:34:10.520 align:start position:0%
introduce the
 
03:34:13.429 --> 03:34:13.439 align:start position:0%
bill I would be delighted to introduce
 
03:34:16.510 --> 03:34:16.520 align:start position:0%
this bill to you
 
03:34:18.469 --> 03:34:18.479 align:start position:0%
so this
 
03:34:21.870 --> 03:34:21.880 align:start position:0%
bill is intended
 
03:34:21.880 --> 03:34:23.590 align:start position:0%
bill is intended
to

03:34:23.590 --> 03:34:23.600 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:34:27.389 --> 03:34:27.399 align:start position:0%
allow the farmers in our state who have
 
03:34:31.070 --> 03:34:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:34.630 --> 03:34:34.640 align:start position:0%
certification um to spray their
 
03:34:34.640 --> 03:34:36.229 align:start position:0%
certification um to spray their
crops

03:34:36.229 --> 03:34:36.239 align:start position:0%
crops
 
03:34:39.910 --> 03:34:39.920 align:start position:0%
using drones currently in our state
 
03:34:43.150 --> 03:34:43.160 align:start position:0%
statute all we are allowed to spray
 
03:34:46.830 --> 03:34:46.840 align:start position:0%
aerially is from helicopters and
 
03:34:49.910 --> 03:34:49.920 align:start position:0%
airplanes and it makes a lot of sense to
 
03:34:53.469 --> 03:34:53.479 align:start position:0%
allow our Farmers to spray their crops
 
03:34:57.229 --> 03:34:57.239 align:start position:0%
using drones because number one they
 
03:35:00.150 --> 03:35:00.160 align:start position:0%
would be could be spot spraying and not
 
03:35:03.790 --> 03:35:03.800 align:start position:0%
have to blanket spray an entire acreage
 
03:35:05.670 --> 03:35:05.680 align:start position:0%
acreage of
 
03:35:10.870 --> 03:35:10.880 align:start position:0%
property um it would uh be more
 
03:35:13.990 --> 03:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
economical for the farmers uh because
 
03:35:17.510 --> 03:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
they're not using as much product to be
 
03:35:20.110 --> 03:35:20.120 align:start position:0%
spraying it's more
 
03:35:23.349 --> 03:35:23.359 align:start position:0%
environmentally um prudent because again
 
03:35:26.510 --> 03:35:26.520 align:start position:0%
they're not using as much product and
 
03:35:28.189 --> 03:35:28.199 align:start position:0%
they are
 
03:35:31.269 --> 03:35:31.279 align:start position:0%
using you know it's it's
 
03:35:35.670 --> 03:35:35.680 align:start position:0%
targeted um application of pesticide or
 
03:35:38.670 --> 03:35:38.680 align:start position:0%
herb aside and
 
03:35:44.550 --> 03:35:44.560 align:start position:0%
um so this this would only allow um for
 
03:35:46.550 --> 03:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
agricultural purposes we wouldn't be
 
03:35:48.550 --> 03:35:48.560 align:start position:0%
using it for you know golf courses or
 
03:35:51.950 --> 03:35:51.960 align:start position:0%
any of that kind of thing and uh so this
 
03:35:54.389 --> 03:35:54.399 align:start position:0%
just adds a section to the uh current
 
03:36:00.030 --> 03:36:00.040 align:start position:0%
law at RSA 430 colon 34 hyphen a section
 
03:36:03.550 --> 03:36:03.560 align:start position:0%
4 um which adds in and so I have also
 
03:36:06.670 --> 03:36:06.680 align:start position:0%
brought an amendment with uh me today
 
03:36:09.710 --> 03:36:09.720 align:start position:0%
it's uh 202 24-10
 
03:36:13.790 --> 03:36:13.800 align:start position:0%
182h which changes the initial language
 
03:36:17.950 --> 03:36:17.960 align:start position:0%
to say that um the uh unmanned
 
03:36:21.510 --> 03:36:21.520 align:start position:0%
aircraft would uh spray at a height not
 
03:36:23.870 --> 03:36:23.880 align:start position:0%
exceeding 20 feet above ground level as
 
03:36:27.030 --> 03:36:27.040 align:start position:0%
opposed to 50 feet and after being on a
 
03:36:28.830 --> 03:36:28.840 align:start position:0%
phone call and talking to several people
 
03:36:31.910 --> 03:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
about it uh it was felt that the 20 foot
 
03:36:34.389 --> 03:36:34.399 align:start position:0%
uh ground level was more appropriate
 
03:36:36.510 --> 03:36:36.520 align:start position:0%
that anything above that is actually
 
03:36:39.710 --> 03:36:39.720 align:start position:0%
when the Drone would be fing around and
 
03:36:42.389 --> 03:36:42.399 align:start position:0%
not spraying anything and also by
 
03:36:45.790 --> 03:36:45.800 align:start position:0%
limiting it to a 20 foot level you are
 
03:36:47.510 --> 03:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
not getting into the situation where
 
03:36:50.110 --> 03:36:50.120 align:start position:0%
there'd be any drift of pesticide to
 
03:36:52.429 --> 03:36:52.439 align:start position:0%
other properties neighboring
 
03:36:56.950 --> 03:36:56.960 align:start position:0%
properties and that's pretty much um all
 
03:37:00.510 --> 03:37:00.520 align:start position:0%
that I have about this bill um we do use
 
03:37:06.830 --> 03:37:06.840 align:start position:0%
the RSA 22 colon 3 uh Roman numeral
 
03:37:10.110 --> 03:37:10.120 align:start position:0%
27-a uh which is what defines what an
 
03:37:13.990 --> 03:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
unmanned aircraft is in um in our
 
03:37:17.469 --> 03:37:17.479 align:start position:0%
statutes and um um think I have that
 
03:37:17.479 --> 03:37:18.630 align:start position:0%
statutes and um um think I have that
somewhere

03:37:18.630 --> 03:37:18.640 align:start position:0%
somewhere
 
03:37:23.070 --> 03:37:23.080 align:start position:0%
here uh yeah I do which is um small
 
03:37:25.790 --> 03:37:25.800 align:start position:0%
unman aircraft means an unman aircraft
 
03:37:29.670 --> 03:37:29.680 align:start position:0%
as defined in Federal Regulations so um
 
03:37:32.030 --> 03:37:32.040 align:start position:0%
if you look on Federal
 
03:37:37.830 --> 03:37:37.840 align:start position:0%
Regulations um it dep it uh 14 CFR part
 
03:37:41.110 --> 03:37:41.120 align:start position:0%
107 uh in federal law also defines what
 
03:37:44.990 --> 03:37:45.000 align:start position:0%
small unmanned aircraft systems are and
 
03:37:47.229 --> 03:37:47.239 align:start position:0%
uh I think I sent a link to the
 
03:37:50.229 --> 03:37:50.239 align:start position:0%
committee uh with all those definitions
 
03:37:53.030 --> 03:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
included so that's what this bill does
 
03:37:55.710 --> 03:37:55.720 align:start position:0%
it basically gives our Farmers a new
 
03:37:59.670 --> 03:37:59.680 align:start position:0%
improved tool in um in being able to
 
03:38:02.630 --> 03:38:02.640 align:start position:0%
manage the pests on their in their
 
03:38:05.550 --> 03:38:05.560 align:start position:0%
crops and I'd be happy to take some
 
03:38:08.389 --> 03:38:08.399 align:start position:0%
questions and representative Bixby yeah
 
03:38:08.399 --> 03:38:09.550 align:start position:0%
questions and representative Bixby yeah
so

03:38:09.550 --> 03:38:09.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:38:14.070 --> 03:38:14.080 align:start position:0%
um in the Federal Regulations uh regard
 
03:38:17.070 --> 03:38:17.080 align:start position:0%
related to the unmanned aircraft uh do
 
03:38:20.070 --> 03:38:20.080 align:start position:0%
the federal federal reg regulations
 
03:38:23.150 --> 03:38:23.160 align:start position:0%
require licensing for operating those
 
03:38:25.630 --> 03:38:25.640 align:start position:0%
yes okay thank
 
03:38:28.510 --> 03:38:28.520 align:start position:0%
you and representative
 
03:38:30.630 --> 03:38:30.640 align:start position:0%
Murray thank you Mr chair that was
 
03:38:32.349 --> 03:38:32.359 align:start position:0%
really my point was just to make sure
 
03:38:34.349 --> 03:38:34.359 align:start position:0%
that um there are federal requirements
 
03:38:36.469 --> 03:38:36.479 align:start position:0%
and they also have um certain
 
03:38:38.269 --> 03:38:38.279 align:start position:0%
requirements to transmit like when
 
03:38:40.229 --> 03:38:40.239 align:start position:0%
they're flying them so that's all part
 
03:38:44.030 --> 03:38:44.040 align:start position:0%
of like the notice to the FAA um and I
 
03:38:45.750 --> 03:38:45.760 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming that those things would
 
03:38:50.309 --> 03:38:50.319 align:start position:0%
fall under all of the uh uh 107 107 is
 
03:38:52.630 --> 03:38:52.640 align:start position:0%
pretty comprehensive they go they it
 
03:38:55.870 --> 03:38:55.880 align:start position:0%
goes for uh several Pages talking about
 
03:38:58.990 --> 03:38:59.000 align:start position:0%
um certification procedures it has
 
03:39:01.710 --> 03:39:01.720 align:start position:0%
definitions um inspection testing and
 
03:39:04.229 --> 03:39:04.239 align:start position:0%
demonstration of compliance safety event
 
03:39:06.630 --> 03:39:06.640 align:start position:0%
reporting uh a whole lot of things so
 
03:39:08.870 --> 03:39:08.880 align:start position:0%
it's pretty comprehensive the federal uh
 
03:39:12.710 --> 03:39:12.720 align:start position:0%
federal law um and I would also say that
 
03:39:16.790 --> 03:39:16.800 align:start position:0%
um you know for for a farmer May who has
 
03:39:16.800 --> 03:39:18.510 align:start position:0%
um you know for for a farmer May who has
pesticide

03:39:18.510 --> 03:39:18.520 align:start position:0%
pesticide
 
03:39:18.520 --> 03:39:20.550 align:start position:0%
pesticide
certification

03:39:20.550 --> 03:39:20.560 align:start position:0%
certification
 
03:39:24.309 --> 03:39:24.319 align:start position:0%
um they may employ a contractor to do
 
03:39:26.670 --> 03:39:26.680 align:start position:0%
the work for them as well and the
 
03:39:28.590 --> 03:39:28.600 align:start position:0%
contractor who has the drones who were
 
03:39:32.189 --> 03:39:32.199 align:start position:0%
doing the spraying um would have all the
 
03:39:33.790 --> 03:39:33.800 align:start position:0%
necessary certifications that they need
 
03:39:35.030 --> 03:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
to fly their
 
03:39:38.269 --> 03:39:38.279 align:start position:0%
drones and repres representative ger
 
03:39:40.150 --> 03:39:40.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you represented
 
03:39:42.189 --> 03:39:42.199 align:start position:0%
for taking my question this may be one
 
03:39:44.389 --> 03:39:44.399 align:start position:0%
of those kind of like differences
 
03:39:46.229 --> 03:39:46.239 align:start position:0%
without a real distinction or
 
03:39:47.990 --> 03:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
distinction without a difference you in
 
03:39:50.150 --> 03:39:50.160 align:start position:0%
your testimony referred to pesticides
 
03:39:52.990 --> 03:39:53.000 align:start position:0%
but then you also added herbicides and
 
03:39:54.349 --> 03:39:54.359 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering the language of the bill
 
03:39:56.990 --> 03:39:57.000 align:start position:0%
is specific to pesticides does it matter
 
03:39:59.990 --> 03:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
well I did talk to um Mr rouso who is
 
03:40:02.590 --> 03:40:02.600 align:start position:0%
chair of the pesticide control board and
 
03:40:04.910 --> 03:40:04.920 align:start position:0%
the definition of pesticides includes
 
03:40:06.429 --> 03:40:06.439 align:start position:0%
herbicides thank you for that
 
03:40:08.610 --> 03:40:08.620 align:start position:0%
clarification representative com
 
03:40:08.620 --> 03:40:13.870 align:start position:0%
clarification representative com
[Laughter]

03:40:13.870 --> 03:40:13.880 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
03:40:17.790 --> 03:40:17.800 align:start position:0%
oops thank you Mr chair and Madame chair
 
03:40:19.830 --> 03:40:19.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Representative no I was just
 
03:40:21.870 --> 03:40:21.880 align:start position:0%
going to clarify that pesticides is the
 
03:40:24.429 --> 03:40:24.439 align:start position:0%
overall language used to include uh you
 
03:40:26.590 --> 03:40:26.600 align:start position:0%
know herbicides insecticides
 
03:40:29.110 --> 03:40:29.120 align:start position:0%
Etc thank you are there any further
 
03:40:31.510 --> 03:40:31.520 align:start position:0%
questions for Madam
 
03:40:34.590 --> 03:40:34.600 align:start position:0%
chair habits are hard to
 
03:40:37.349 --> 03:40:37.359 align:start position:0%
break yeah so
 
03:40:41.830 --> 03:40:41.840 align:start position:0%
um how does this might be do we have we
 
03:40:44.710 --> 03:40:44.720 align:start position:0%
might have someone coming up who can ex
 
03:40:48.710 --> 03:40:48.720 align:start position:0%
go into this more deeply but um how does
 
03:40:53.429 --> 03:40:53.439 align:start position:0%
uh the spraying of uh pesticides at 20
 
03:40:57.469 --> 03:40:57.479 align:start position:0%
ft or below compared with compare with
 
03:41:00.309 --> 03:41:00.319 align:start position:0%
the procedure for doing it uh from a
 
03:41:04.229 --> 03:41:04.239 align:start position:0%
plane at a higher level or versus um
 
03:41:06.830 --> 03:41:06.840 align:start position:0%
using a ground spraying rig uh which
 
03:41:09.469 --> 03:41:09.479 align:start position:0%
which is it more similar to this is more
 
03:41:12.429 --> 03:41:12.439 align:start position:0%
similar to a ground spraying rig okay in
 
03:41:14.870 --> 03:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
terms of um well if you're if you're
 
03:41:17.389 --> 03:41:17.399 align:start position:0%
going to spray
 
03:41:20.189 --> 03:41:20.199 align:start position:0%
aerially um with an airplane or
 
03:41:22.429 --> 03:41:22.439 align:start position:0%
helicopter there is an a whole section
 
03:41:25.830 --> 03:41:25.840 align:start position:0%
of notification for a Butters or for you
 
03:41:28.309 --> 03:41:28.319 align:start position:0%
know people who are around the area
 
03:41:30.910 --> 03:41:30.920 align:start position:0%
being sprayed um there there's some
 
03:41:32.950 --> 03:41:32.960 align:start position:0%
notification procedures that go along
 
03:41:37.550 --> 03:41:37.560 align:start position:0%
with that and um for for ground spraying
 
03:41:41.189 --> 03:41:41.199 align:start position:0%
we don't have any um notification
 
03:41:43.309 --> 03:41:43.319 align:start position:0%
procedures which would be the same for
 
03:41:47.269 --> 03:41:47.279 align:start position:0%
the Drone activity okay thank you and
 
03:41:49.070 --> 03:41:49.080 align:start position:0%
representative Murray uh thank you Mr
 
03:41:50.830 --> 03:41:50.840 align:start position:0%
chair and thanks for taking my question
 
03:41:53.510 --> 03:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
I representative I have a
 
03:41:55.710 --> 03:41:55.720 align:start position:0%
um I I just want to make sure the same
 
03:41:58.510 --> 03:41:58.520 align:start position:0%
sort of application control standards
 
03:42:00.670 --> 03:42:00.680 align:start position:0%
and regulations that would apply for
 
03:42:03.349 --> 03:42:03.359 align:start position:0%
ground application or any of those other
 
03:42:05.030 --> 03:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
things would still exist right in the
 
03:42:06.750 --> 03:42:06.760 align:start position:0%
same framework it would just sort of all
 
03:42:10.389 --> 03:42:10.399 align:start position:0%
come underneath of yes okay as as I
 
03:42:13.590 --> 03:42:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:16.309 --> 03:42:16.319 align:start position:0%
yes repr
 
03:42:17.630 --> 03:42:17.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
03:42:20.590 --> 03:42:20.600 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
03:42:24.790 --> 03:42:24.800 align:start position:0%
um would you say that um when we we're
 
03:42:26.630 --> 03:42:26.640 align:start position:0%
thinking about spraying a drone at 20
 
03:42:29.269 --> 03:42:29.279 align:start position:0%
feet uh we're spraying down where with
 
03:42:31.149 --> 03:42:31.159 align:start position:0%
an aerial spray and an orchard we're
 
03:42:33.750 --> 03:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
spraying up so that's probably going
 
03:42:35.630 --> 03:42:35.640 align:start position:0%
could even go higher than 20 feet would
 
03:42:37.830 --> 03:42:37.840 align:start position:0%
you say that um would is a reasonable
 
03:42:40.990 --> 03:42:41.000 align:start position:0%
assumption I don't know I would uh ask
 
03:42:44.189 --> 03:42:44.199 align:start position:0%
that of uh anybody who would be coming
 
03:42:47.750 --> 03:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
after me who's aarm mer who is doing the
 
03:42:47.760 --> 03:42:50.189 align:start position:0%
after me who's aarm mer who is doing the
spraying

03:42:50.189 --> 03:42:50.199 align:start position:0%
spraying
 
03:42:53.710 --> 03:42:53.720 align:start position:0%
sure okay seeing no further questions
 
03:42:55.670 --> 03:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
thank you ma'am appreciate your
 
03:42:58.429 --> 03:42:58.439 align:start position:0%

policy director and if you'll forgive me
 
03:44:03.630 --> 03:44:03.640 align:start position:0%
I'm going to I'm going to um read much

add uh to that as I as I go what what I
 
03:44:13.510 --> 03:44:13.520 align:start position:0%
have provided you is our letter of
 
03:44:15.910 --> 03:44:15.920 align:start position:0%
support and then a attached to that and
 
03:44:17.950 --> 03:44:17.960 align:start position:0%
I'll speak to it later but it's a
 
03:44:22.630 --> 03:44:22.640 align:start position:0%
section 44807 of the FFA uh regulations
 
03:44:27.910 --> 03:44:27.920 align:start position:0%
and then also the the uh part um uh p506
 
03:44:31.070 --> 03:44:31.080 align:start position:0%
which is the rule uh that uh goes along
 
03:44:33.070 --> 03:44:33.080 align:start position:0%
with the statute and then in the letter
 
03:44:35.349 --> 03:44:35.359 align:start position:0%
what I've provided is in the box at the

03:44:46.070 --> 03:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
introduced as introduced by the chair
 
03:44:49.429 --> 03:44:49.439 align:start position:0%
with and read the the the uh additional
 
03:44:49.439 --> 03:44:52.630 align:start position:0%
with and read the the the uh additional
Amendment

03:44:52.630 --> 03:44:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:55.429 --> 03:44:55.439 align:start position:0%
there Farm Bureau is in in strong
 
03:44:58.189 --> 03:44:58.199 align:start position:0%
support of of House Bill 1698 it it's
 
03:44:59.830 --> 03:44:59.840 align:start position:0%
it's a bill that we have been working
 
03:45:03.269 --> 03:45:03.279 align:start position:0%
with the sponsor on and and uh uh uh
 
03:45:06.670 --> 03:45:06.680 align:start position:0%
based on uh requests from our membership
 
03:45:08.309 --> 03:45:08.319 align:start position:0%
have have have worked with her on you
 
03:45:12.349 --> 03:45:12.359 align:start position:0%
you'll hear from from uh the uh at least
 
03:45:14.670 --> 03:45:14.680 align:start position:0%
the the member who initially members who
 
03:45:17.349 --> 03:45:17.359 align:start position:0%
initially approached us and what it what
 
03:45:20.149 --> 03:45:20.159 align:start position:0%
the bill does in a nutshell it provides
 
03:45:23.550 --> 03:45:23.560 align:start position:0%
licensed pesticide applicators holding a
 
03:45:26.670 --> 03:45:26.680 align:start position:0%
Federal Aviation Administration part 107
 
03:45:28.830 --> 03:45:28.840 align:start position:0%
certification which which was required
 
03:45:32.590 --> 03:45:32.600 align:start position:0%
to fly an unmanned aircraft uh or drone
 
03:45:36.229 --> 03:45:36.239 align:start position:0%
uh the uh practical and I'm I'm
 
03:45:39.510 --> 03:45:39.520 align:start position:0%
underlying practical option uh to use
 
03:45:43.309 --> 03:45:43.319 align:start position:0%
the technology uh to to protect uh to
 
03:45:45.550 --> 03:45:45.560 align:start position:0%
apply to as a crop to apply crop
 
03:45:48.309 --> 03:45:48.319 align:start position:0%
protectant and I say practical because
 
03:45:51.389 --> 03:45:51.399 align:start position:0%
technically you currently can use a
 
03:45:55.070 --> 03:45:55.080 align:start position:0%
drone but the rule is is prohibitive you
 
03:45:57.750 --> 03:45:57.760 align:start position:0%
this it makes no sense uh the the and
 
03:45:59.990 --> 03:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
I'll get into that a little bit but just
 
03:46:02.910 --> 03:46:02.920 align:start position:0%
currently if I want to apply pesticides
 
03:46:05.510 --> 03:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
via aerial application that includes a
 
03:46:08.030 --> 03:46:08.040 align:start position:0%
drone helicopter airplane I have to get
 
03:46:10.309 --> 03:46:10.319 align:start position:0%
the the application to the division for
 
03:46:13.110 --> 03:46:13.120 align:start position:0%
one thing 90 days before which which in
 
03:46:15.590 --> 03:46:15.600 align:start position:0%
an application for a farmer makes no
 
03:46:17.269 --> 03:46:17.279 align:start position:0%
sense and then there's other public
 
03:46:19.670 --> 03:46:19.680 align:start position:0%
notification requirements and and we'll
 
03:46:23.510 --> 03:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
get into that so again it's a this is to
 
03:46:27.469 --> 03:46:27.479 align:start position:0%
provide a practical option um the the
 
03:46:30.990 --> 03:46:31.000 align:start position:0%
sponsor touched on the the
 
03:46:34.309 --> 03:46:34.319 align:start position:0%
um the the amendment and if you see the
 
03:46:36.950 --> 03:46:36.960 align:start position:0%
bill is introduced had a a limit of 50
 
03:46:40.750 --> 03:46:40.760 align:start position:0%
feet and we we're we're uh supporting a
 
03:46:43.630 --> 03:46:43.640 align:start position:0%
reduction in 20 ft to that and initially
 
03:46:45.830 --> 03:46:45.840 align:start position:0%
and speaking with drone applicators the
 
03:46:47.429 --> 03:46:47.439 align:start position:0%
question we had was well how much how
 
03:46:49.750 --> 03:46:49.760 align:start position:0%
much height do you need and what the
 
03:46:52.149 --> 03:46:52.159 align:start position:0%
answer initially was well we need 50 fet
 
03:46:54.630 --> 03:46:54.640 align:start position:0%
well they need the 50 feet in order to
 
03:46:57.510 --> 03:46:57.520 align:start position:0%
get the payload to where it needs to be
 
03:46:59.910 --> 03:46:59.920 align:start position:0%
most applications are under 20 feet
 
03:47:01.870 --> 03:47:01.880 align:start position:0%
nearly all of them are under 10 feet but
 
03:47:03.550 --> 03:47:03.560 align:start position:0%
they they we asking for the 20 to give
 
03:47:05.389 --> 03:47:05.399 align:start position:0%
that that little bit of that buffer but
 
03:47:06.870 --> 03:47:06.880 align:start position:0%
again that just so you know that that
 
03:47:09.030 --> 03:47:09.040 align:start position:0%
initial 50 was really about the height
 
03:47:11.990 --> 03:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
that a a a a drone would be with its
 
03:47:14.189 --> 03:47:14.199 align:start position:0%
payload so that that's why we're
 
03:47:16.950 --> 03:47:16.960 align:start position:0%
requesting that that
 
03:47:20.750 --> 03:47:20.760 align:start position:0%
and there has is existing under the
 
03:47:23.990 --> 03:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
existing statute which was adopted 1995
 
03:47:25.630 --> 03:47:25.640 align:start position:0%
there's never been an agricultural
 
03:47:27.630 --> 03:47:27.640 align:start position:0%
approval for the reasons I've stated
 
03:47:29.750 --> 03:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
it's just it's it's part of it's the we
 
03:47:31.389 --> 03:47:31.399 align:start position:0%
didn't have the technology that we do
 
03:47:34.550 --> 03:47:34.560 align:start position:0%
now but also just the the the the uh
 
03:47:37.149 --> 03:47:37.159 align:start position:0%
burden of it
 
03:47:41.950 --> 03:47:41.960 align:start position:0%
all the bill amends RSA 430 col 34- a
 
03:47:43.630 --> 03:47:43.640 align:start position:0%
which again I said earlier pass into law
 
03:47:46.630 --> 03:47:46.640 align:start position:0%
1995 with with airplanes and helicopters
 
03:47:46.640 --> 03:47:52.670 align:start position:0%
1995 with with airplanes and helicopters
in

03:47:52.670 --> 03:47:52.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:57.070 --> 03:47:57.080 align:start position:0%
mind the RSA and the accompanying rules
 
03:48:00.269 --> 03:48:00.279 align:start position:0%
which are was PES 506 aerial application
 
03:48:03.070 --> 03:48:03.080 align:start position:0%
of pesticides I have provided you are
 
03:48:05.550 --> 03:48:05.560 align:start position:0%
overly burdensome costly and not
 
03:48:08.189 --> 03:48:08.199 align:start position:0%
practical for targeted drone application
 
03:48:10.790 --> 03:48:10.800 align:start position:0%
of crop protectants it includes
 
03:48:14.070 --> 03:48:14.080 align:start position:0%
requiring a a a a detailed map of the
 
03:48:15.469 --> 03:48:15.479 align:start position:0%
treatment area
 
03:48:17.590 --> 03:48:17.600 align:start position:0%
identifying sensitive areas which which
 
03:48:19.750 --> 03:48:19.760 align:start position:0%
are really not defined in the rule but
 
03:48:23.389 --> 03:48:23.399 align:start position:0%
it it's there are uh within there's two
 
03:48:27.990 --> 03:48:28.000 align:start position:0%
stages there's a a uh uh the the uh um
 
03:48:30.349 --> 03:48:30.359 align:start position:0%
the use in a in what are considered
 
03:48:32.070 --> 03:48:32.080 align:start position:0%
non-residential areas and then in
 
03:48:33.630 --> 03:48:33.640 align:start position:0%
residential areas if it's considered a
 
03:48:35.429 --> 03:48:35.439 align:start position:0%
residential area which is very broadly
 
03:48:37.510 --> 03:48:37.520 align:start position:0%
drawn basically anything zoned in the
 
03:48:40.149 --> 03:48:40.159 align:start position:0%
community is residential requires the
 
03:48:45.429 --> 03:48:45.439 align:start position:0%
the uh the enhanced uh permit uh if
 
03:48:47.550 --> 03:48:47.560 align:start position:0%
uh which would then require with that
 
03:48:50.269 --> 03:48:50.279 align:start position:0%
enhanced piece then it's it's you know
 
03:48:52.070 --> 03:48:52.080 align:start position:0%
notifications butter
 
03:48:55.429 --> 03:48:55.439 align:start position:0%
notifications uh Noti in newspapers
 
03:49:13.710 --> 03:49:13.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:15.910 --> 03:49:15.920 align:start position:0%
um I'm trying to decide which order I
 
03:49:19.630 --> 03:49:19.640 align:start position:0%
want to go in here um in and and I we
 
03:49:22.429 --> 03:49:22.439 align:start position:0%
were hoping to have a a uh a a
 
03:49:24.189 --> 03:49:24.199 align:start position:0%
applicator here today A J applicator
 
03:49:25.750 --> 03:49:25.760 align:start position:0%
from mod of state who's who's doing it
 
03:49:28.189 --> 03:49:28.199 align:start position:0%
in New York and Pennsylvania uh he was
 
03:49:29.790 --> 03:49:29.800 align:start position:0%
unfortunately this morning was on Route
 
03:49:30.950 --> 03:49:30.960 align:start position:0%
and he got a call that one of his
 
03:49:32.189 --> 03:49:32.199 align:start position:0%
children were sick and he had to turn
 
03:49:34.389 --> 03:49:34.399 align:start position:0%
back so at some point hopefully we can
 
03:49:36.309 --> 03:49:36.319 align:start position:0%
make him available if the committee has
 
03:49:38.830 --> 03:49:38.840 align:start position:0%
questions but he did raise a concern to
 
03:49:42.189 --> 03:49:42.199 align:start position:0%
me in in further reading the bill with
 
03:49:44.870 --> 03:49:44.880 align:start position:0%
the with the with the proposed language
 
03:49:47.710 --> 03:49:47.720 align:start position:0%
in in Roman 4 there's the term being
 
03:49:50.229 --> 03:49:50.239 align:start position:0%
used in that last complete sentence
 
03:49:50.239 --> 03:49:51.830 align:start position:0%
used in that last complete sentence
unmanned

03:49:51.830 --> 03:49:51.840 align:start position:0%
unmanned
 
03:49:55.710 --> 03:49:55.720 align:start position:0%
aircraft and and then it cites RSA 422
 
03:49:59.550 --> 03:49:59.560 align:start position:0%
colon 3 uh with the Roman numeral well e
 
03:50:01.229 --> 03:50:01.239 align:start position:0%
you know I'm not going to it's What what
 
03:50:01.239 --> 03:50:02.590 align:start position:0%
you know I'm not going to it's What what
20

03:50:02.590 --> 03:50:02.600 align:start position:0%
20
 
03:50:06.870 --> 03:50:06.880 align:start position:0%
27 um that Roman 27 if you if you look
 
03:50:08.550 --> 03:50:08.560 align:start position:0%
at the statute the definition of small
 
03:50:10.590 --> 03:50:10.600 align:start position:0%
unmanned aircraft means an unmanned
 
03:50:13.229 --> 03:50:13.239 align:start position:0%
aircraft is defined in Federal Federal
 
03:50:15.269 --> 03:50:15.279 align:start position:0%
Regulations as amended and I provided
 
03:50:16.670 --> 03:50:16.680 align:start position:0%
that definition below which I believe
 
03:50:18.189 --> 03:50:18.199 align:start position:0%
the sponsor has provided you the more
 
03:50:21.349 --> 03:50:21.359 align:start position:0%
complete statue which which which limits
 
03:50:24.590 --> 03:50:24.600 align:start position:0%
uh the these drone uses to 55 pounds and
 
03:50:26.710 --> 03:50:26.720 align:start position:0%
he said that's that is basically would
 
03:50:30.269 --> 03:50:30.279 align:start position:0%
make the the statute uh close to useless
 
03:50:31.830 --> 03:50:31.840 align:start position:0%
you certainly wouldn't draw people from
 
03:50:34.389 --> 03:50:34.399 align:start position:0%
out state to for our Farmers to hire
 
03:50:35.590 --> 03:50:35.600 align:start position:0%
because of that limit you got to
 
03:50:37.269 --> 03:50:37.279 align:start position:0%
remember that five gallons of water
 
03:50:40.229 --> 03:50:40.239 align:start position:0%
alone weighs 40 pounds so it's it's just
 
03:50:43.349 --> 03:50:43.359 align:start position:0%
too small so he he alerted me to this I
 
03:50:45.910 --> 03:50:45.920 align:start position:0%
cited up a and bold that section
 
03:50:49.910 --> 03:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
44807 which if if uh we we in order to
 
03:50:51.990 --> 03:50:52.000 align:start position:0%
make this useful we we need to be made
 
03:50:54.429 --> 03:50:54.439 align:start position:0%
clear in the statute you could read the
 
03:50:56.750 --> 03:50:56.760 align:start position:0%
statute as still allowing it but it's
 
03:50:59.670 --> 03:50:59.680 align:start position:0%
not very clear and that would that would
 
03:51:01.590 --> 03:51:01.600 align:start position:0%
make it make it clear and what that
 
03:51:04.389 --> 03:51:04.399 align:start position:0%
section 44807 is as he termed it to me
 
03:51:07.389 --> 03:51:07.399 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's it's termed experimental
 
03:51:10.030 --> 03:51:10.040 align:start position:0%
section by the FFA but it's what he uses
 
03:51:13.389 --> 03:51:13.399 align:start position:0%
to apply in in other states and as he
 
03:51:16.349 --> 03:51:16.359 align:start position:0%
has telling told me that uh this aerial
 
03:51:18.750 --> 03:51:18.760 align:start position:0%
application is essentially allowed in
 
03:51:20.189 --> 03:51:20.199 align:start position:0%
every state in the Union except for the
 
03:51:22.550 --> 03:51:22.560 align:start position:0%
New England states so we we're a little
 
03:51:24.309 --> 03:51:24.319 align:start position:0%
behind the curve and our farmers do not
 
03:51:26.910 --> 03:51:26.920 align:start position:0%
have uh use of the technology that many
 
03:51:26.920 --> 03:51:30.309 align:start position:0%
have uh use of the technology that many
others

03:51:30.309 --> 03:51:30.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:33.630 --> 03:51:33.640 align:start position:0%
do the as the the sponsor did site the
 
03:51:35.469 --> 03:51:35.479 align:start position:0%
Drone application offers Farmers a
 
03:51:38.070 --> 03:51:38.080 align:start position:0%
number of benefits related to efficiency
 
03:51:40.990 --> 03:51:41.000 align:start position:0%
in safety and I've listed some of these
 
03:51:43.630 --> 03:51:43.640 align:start position:0%
it's really this the timeliness is huge
 
03:51:46.469 --> 03:51:46.479 align:start position:0%
the targeted application as as some
 
03:51:48.870 --> 03:51:48.880 align:start position:0%
Growers have said to me they they turn
 
03:51:51.429 --> 03:51:51.439 align:start position:0%
with Precision they they really get are
 
03:51:53.790 --> 03:51:53.800 align:start position:0%
able to apply that product where where
 
03:51:56.349 --> 03:51:56.359 align:start position:0%
it's needed in in in some some of the
 
03:51:58.590 --> 03:51:58.600 align:start position:0%
areas where our our farmers and I think
 
03:52:00.990 --> 03:52:01.000 align:start position:0%
some of them will speak to this but in
 
03:52:03.750 --> 03:52:03.760 align:start position:0%
corn it's currently a a I'll call it
 
03:52:07.670 --> 03:52:07.680 align:start position:0%
weed bur cucumber that is a it's a Vine
 
03:52:11.229 --> 03:52:11.239 align:start position:0%
and and it it it's it's uh it literally
 
03:52:15.469 --> 03:52:15.479 align:start position:0%
will will um uh uh uh when when you use
 
03:52:18.389 --> 03:52:18.399 align:start position:0%
it it'll it'll uh what do I want to say
 
03:52:20.309 --> 03:52:20.319 align:start position:0%
stop a combine it's that it'll it'll
 
03:52:21.870 --> 03:52:21.880 align:start position:0%
tangle in and literally bring it to a
 
03:52:24.469 --> 03:52:24.479 align:start position:0%
hall it's that it's that aggressive in
 
03:52:28.670 --> 03:52:28.680 align:start position:0%
and strong of a of a weed um other areas
 
03:52:30.870 --> 03:52:30.880 align:start position:0%
would be our Fruit Growers they
 
03:52:32.990 --> 03:52:33.000 align:start position:0%
currently use blast sprayers in order to
 
03:52:34.990 --> 03:52:35.000 align:start position:0%
get up into the canopy of the tree and
 
03:52:36.670 --> 03:52:36.680 align:start position:0%
that said the Drone would would offer
 
03:52:39.550 --> 03:52:39.560 align:start position:0%
much more Precision um also mentioned to
 
03:52:41.830 --> 03:52:41.840 align:start position:0%
me has been when you get into small
 
03:52:43.790 --> 03:52:43.800 align:start position:0%
fruit crops like blueberries raspberries
 
03:52:46.309 --> 03:52:46.319 align:start position:0%
that type of thing often there'll be uh
 
03:52:49.469 --> 03:52:49.479 align:start position:0%
limited uh uh rows that have access to
 
03:52:52.710 --> 03:52:52.720 align:start position:0%
the to the through the the planting and
 
03:52:55.550 --> 03:52:55.560 align:start position:0%
and a a smaller drone at a at a small
 
03:52:58.590 --> 03:52:58.600 align:start position:0%
height would allow them to to apply
 
03:53:00.510 --> 03:53:00.520 align:start position:0%
protectants especially you've you
 
03:53:02.710 --> 03:53:02.720 align:start position:0%
probably heard of spoted wing jopa
 
03:53:04.790 --> 03:53:04.800 align:start position:0%
that's a big problem now that will will
 
03:53:07.349 --> 03:53:07.359 align:start position:0%
land on fruit just before it's ripe or
 
03:53:09.349 --> 03:53:09.359 align:start position:0%
as it's ripening lay aegs and then the
 
03:53:10.990 --> 03:53:11.000 align:start position:0%
the the the the food is gone so that
 
03:53:15.189 --> 03:53:15.199 align:start position:0%
would be a a value there um but in in
 
03:53:18.510 --> 03:53:18.520 align:start position:0%
addition to uh you know with with soil I
 
03:53:20.830 --> 03:53:20.840 align:start position:0%
mean if if you if you have a problem now
 
03:53:22.590 --> 03:53:22.600 align:start position:0%
and you've got wet soil and you need to
 
03:53:24.870 --> 03:53:24.880 align:start position:0%
get on it with a with a with a with a
 
03:53:26.070 --> 03:53:26.080 align:start position:0%
vehicle of some type you know you're
 
03:53:28.750 --> 03:53:28.760 align:start position:0%
risking soil compaction which damages
 
03:53:33.030 --> 03:53:33.040 align:start position:0%
the roots of the of the uh of your
 
03:53:34.950 --> 03:53:34.960 align:start position:0%
growing crop and then there's you know
 
03:53:37.349 --> 03:53:37.359 align:start position:0%
the fuel and Time Savings and and I I
 
03:53:39.309 --> 03:53:39.319 align:start position:0%
think probably one of the the the the
 
03:53:40.990 --> 03:53:41.000 align:start position:0%
other real benefits of this is worker
 
03:53:42.550 --> 03:53:42.560 align:start position:0%
protection because the the product is
 
03:53:44.550 --> 03:53:44.560 align:start position:0%
being applied away from I mean there's
 
03:53:46.429 --> 03:53:46.439 align:start position:0%
also obviously where the work the drones
 
03:53:48.469 --> 03:53:48.479 align:start position:0%
are being filled but there's you know
 
03:53:50.830 --> 03:53:50.840 align:start position:0%
then the product is being dispersed away
 
03:53:53.590 --> 03:53:53.600 align:start position:0%
from people so there's a we we we see
 
03:53:55.550 --> 03:53:55.560 align:start position:0%
that as a a real
 
03:53:58.349 --> 03:53:58.359 align:start position:0%
benefit so I'll I'll try I'll sum it up
 
03:54:00.870 --> 03:54:00.880 align:start position:0%
here that you know we we we we urge you
 
03:54:04.189 --> 03:54:04.199 align:start position:0%
the committee to to find a way to enable
 
03:54:06.710 --> 03:54:06.720 align:start position:0%
uh the the the the use of drones to
 
03:54:09.149 --> 03:54:09.159 align:start position:0%
apply crop protectants it's it's it is
 
03:54:11.070 --> 03:54:11.080 align:start position:0%
it's the it is the latest in technology
 
03:54:13.030 --> 03:54:13.040 align:start position:0%
it puts our our farmers at the The
 
03:54:16.429 --> 03:54:16.439 align:start position:0%
Cutting Edge and and like I said it's
 
03:54:18.309 --> 03:54:18.319 align:start position:0%
from what I'm being told is pretty much
 
03:54:20.469 --> 03:54:20.479 align:start position:0%
every state outside of New England
 
03:54:22.830 --> 03:54:22.840 align:start position:0%
allows it I know I was told that you
 
03:54:24.349 --> 03:54:24.359 align:start position:0%
Rhode Island does because they don't
 
03:54:26.189 --> 03:54:26.199 align:start position:0%
have an aerial application statute like
 
03:54:28.189 --> 03:54:28.199 align:start position:0%
we do I guess this aerial application
 
03:54:30.710 --> 03:54:30.720 align:start position:0%
piece is more to the in Northern New
 
03:54:32.950 --> 03:54:32.960 align:start position:0%
England and we do see it as a true
 
03:54:34.670 --> 03:54:34.680 align:start position:0%
benefit for Farmers as well as the
 
03:54:37.149 --> 03:54:37.159 align:start position:0%
environment and and um I I'll leave it
 
03:54:39.269 --> 03:54:39.279 align:start position:0%
at that you've got some some experts
 
03:54:41.229 --> 03:54:41.239 align:start position:0%
here that will offer you some some I
 
03:54:43.590 --> 03:54:43.600 align:start position:0%
think a very informative testimony thank
 
03:54:45.030 --> 03:54:45.040 align:start position:0%
you oh thank thank you very much for
 
03:54:47.670 --> 03:54:47.680 align:start position:0%
your testimony the the one question I've
 
03:54:51.429 --> 03:54:51.439 align:start position:0%
got is so 55 PBS wasn't the right number
 
03:54:54.590 --> 03:54:54.600 align:start position:0%
did they offer a number that
 
03:54:58.990 --> 03:54:59.000 align:start position:0%
that my understanding is and I I I I
 
03:55:00.630 --> 03:55:00.640 align:start position:0%
just learned this recently so I had to
 
03:55:02.149 --> 03:55:02.159 align:start position:0%
do some quick research but this what I
 
03:55:04.630 --> 03:55:04.640 align:start position:0%
attached to you that section
 
03:55:08.550 --> 03:55:08.560 align:start position:0%
44807 is is is what needs to be enabled
 
03:55:10.429 --> 03:55:10.439 align:start position:0%
by by the the language that's what
 
03:55:12.030 --> 03:55:12.040 align:start position:0%
that's what this particular operator
 
03:55:13.469 --> 03:55:13.479 align:start position:0%
operates under and what he told me
 
03:55:14.990 --> 03:55:15.000 align:start position:0%
that's what others operate right under
 
03:55:17.469 --> 03:55:17.479 align:start position:0%
so I'll like I'll I will work to get the
 
03:55:20.349 --> 03:55:20.359 align:start position:0%
committee some language um as to what
 
03:55:24.870 --> 03:55:24.880 align:start position:0%
would Encompass that okay any questions
 
03:55:27.030 --> 03:55:27.040 align:start position:0%
representative muray uh thank you Mr
 
03:55:29.189 --> 03:55:29.199 align:start position:0%
chair and thanks for taking my question
 
03:55:32.349 --> 03:55:32.359 align:start position:0%
um so I I did have a couple of of
 
03:55:34.670 --> 03:55:34.680 align:start position:0%
questions there are you aware that there
 
03:55:37.750 --> 03:55:37.760 align:start position:0%
is there is an exemption permit that is
 
03:55:39.389 --> 03:55:39.399 align:start position:0%
available through and is required
 
03:55:41.349 --> 03:55:41.359 align:start position:0%
through the FAA for drones weighing over
 
03:55:44.469 --> 03:55:44.479 align:start position:0%
55 pounds so there is already that
 
03:55:46.750 --> 03:55:46.760 align:start position:0%
there's already a requirement for an
 
03:55:48.309 --> 03:55:48.319 align:start position:0%
exemption permit for Farmers to use
 
03:55:51.429 --> 03:55:51.439 align:start position:0%
under a agricultural use with preference
 
03:55:55.269 --> 03:55:55.279 align:start position:0%
given to um those who are seeking the
 
03:55:59.070 --> 03:55:59.080 align:start position:0%
exemption under agricultural related
 
03:56:02.429 --> 03:56:02.439 align:start position:0%
operations and then my second
 
03:56:08.269 --> 03:56:08.279 align:start position:0%
followup if I may is uh with regard
 
03:56:11.429 --> 03:56:11.439 align:start position:0%
to this specific Bill
 
03:56:15.030 --> 03:56:15.040 align:start position:0%
are are we talking about the launch of a
 
03:56:18.149 --> 03:56:18.159 align:start position:0%
drone on the footprint of an of a
 
03:56:19.950 --> 03:56:19.960 align:start position:0%
property not traversing somebody else's
 
03:56:21.750 --> 03:56:21.760 align:start position:0%
property where a butter notification or
 
03:56:24.309 --> 03:56:24.319 align:start position:0%
anything like that would have to happen
 
03:56:26.590 --> 03:56:26.600 align:start position:0%
we we're talking the launching on the
 
03:56:29.990 --> 03:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
site of the application okay thank you
 
03:56:32.990 --> 03:56:33.000 align:start position:0%
and in in in in U clarification to I
 
03:56:35.269 --> 03:56:35.279 align:start position:0%
guess your first question my
 
03:56:36.830 --> 03:56:36.840 align:start position:0%
understanding is that this what I'm
 
03:56:38.750 --> 03:56:38.760 align:start position:0%
talking about this which is attach this
 
03:56:40.389 --> 03:56:40.399 align:start position:0%
uh section
 
03:56:43.110 --> 03:56:43.120 align:start position:0%
44807 is something that is under the
 
03:56:46.269 --> 03:56:46.279 align:start position:0%
part 107 The Lure and then this is this
 
03:56:48.950 --> 03:56:48.960 align:start position:0%
is part of that why I bring it up is
 
03:56:50.950 --> 03:56:50.960 align:start position:0%
this drone applicator who does this in
 
03:56:54.030 --> 03:56:54.040 align:start position:0%
other states and further looking uh what
 
03:56:56.910 --> 03:56:56.920 align:start position:0%
I did is I sent him the complete statute
 
03:56:58.910 --> 03:56:58.920 align:start position:0%
and then I also I I sent him the
 
03:57:00.630 --> 03:57:00.640 align:start position:0%
definition of of
 
03:57:03.030 --> 03:57:03.040 align:start position:0%
4223 and that's when he came back and he
 
03:57:05.670 --> 03:57:05.680 align:start position:0%
said it just wasn't clear to him that
 
03:57:07.229 --> 03:57:07.239 align:start position:0%
what was needed and there might be
 
03:57:09.429 --> 03:57:09.439 align:start position:0%
because there's also a there's a
 
03:57:13.189 --> 03:57:13.199 align:start position:0%
definition of uh small unmanned aircraft
 
03:57:14.710 --> 03:57:14.720 align:start position:0%
and there's a
 
03:57:14.720 --> 03:57:16.389 align:start position:0%
and there's a
unmanned

03:57:16.389 --> 03:57:16.399 align:start position:0%
unmanned
 
03:57:18.550 --> 03:57:18.560 align:start position:0%
aircraft I'm gonna figet this with
 
03:57:20.990 --> 03:57:21.000 align:start position:0%
another word that he just said it just
 
03:57:22.990 --> 03:57:23.000 align:start position:0%
wasn't clear to him and that maybe we
 
03:57:24.149 --> 03:57:24.159 align:start position:0%
need to be looking at that that's why
 
03:57:25.910 --> 03:57:25.920 align:start position:0%
I'm raising it now so it doesn't come be
 
03:57:29.070 --> 03:57:29.080 align:start position:0%
become an issue later okay um yes one
 
03:57:30.830 --> 03:57:30.840 align:start position:0%
please I'm wondering if it makes sense
 
03:57:34.229 --> 03:57:34.239 align:start position:0%
to then just refer back to some of the
 
03:57:36.910 --> 03:57:36.920 align:start position:0%
language that's already enumerated under
 
03:57:39.790 --> 03:57:39.800 align:start position:0%
I think it's 14 CFR part 91 which is a
 
03:57:42.429 --> 03:57:42.439 align:start position:0%
round drone application through the FAA
 
03:57:43.590 --> 03:57:43.600 align:start position:0%
and that's why I'm wondering if there
 
03:57:46.349 --> 03:57:46.359 align:start position:0%
might be a more appropriate word it it
 
03:57:48.990 --> 03:57:49.000 align:start position:0%
could be part of my hesitancy also is I
 
03:57:51.550 --> 03:57:51.560 align:start position:0%
should mention that this draft language
 
03:57:54.269 --> 03:57:54.279 align:start position:0%
is I worked with director Russo
 
03:57:56.149 --> 03:57:56.159 align:start position:0%
initially to put this together and and
 
03:57:58.550 --> 03:57:58.560 align:start position:0%
he's currently not available so so
 
03:58:00.870 --> 03:58:00.880 align:start position:0%
that's why um there's a reason he cited
 
03:58:02.550 --> 03:58:02.560 align:start position:0%
that I I guess we need to find out
 
03:58:05.110 --> 03:58:05.120 align:start position:0%
exactly why if there's a reason or
 
03:58:07.910 --> 03:58:07.920 align:start position:0%
whatever fair enough represent
 
03:58:10.830 --> 03:58:10.840 align:start position:0%
Bigby yeah so I was just
 
03:58:12.990 --> 03:58:13.000 align:start position:0%
um just wanted to let you know that
 
03:58:15.790 --> 03:58:15.800 align:start position:0%
we're going to be exact backing this on
 
03:58:19.349 --> 03:58:19.359 align:start position:0%
Tuesday so uh so there's going to be a
 
03:58:21.349 --> 03:58:21.359 align:start position:0%
relatively short turnaround time for any
 
03:58:22.750 --> 03:58:22.760 align:start position:0%
Amendment and it sounds like we're going
 
03:58:25.630 --> 03:58:25.640 align:start position:0%
to need to have to amend it in order to
 
03:58:30.070 --> 03:58:30.080 align:start position:0%
get the appropriate uh aircraft size
 
03:58:35.189 --> 03:58:35.199 align:start position:0%
language um added to it uh so uh would
 
03:58:37.630 --> 03:58:37.640 align:start position:0%
you be able to work with the chair uh to
 
03:58:39.990 --> 03:58:40.000 align:start position:0%
help get her that language um
 
03:58:43.309 --> 03:58:43.319 align:start position:0%
expeditiously yeah I my we probably will
 
03:58:44.630 --> 03:58:44.640 align:start position:0%
need language but I'm going to say I'm
 
03:58:47.670 --> 03:58:47.680 align:start position:0%
not I'm not sure and and just your
 
03:58:49.189 --> 03:58:49.199 align:start position:0%
question brings up another one that the
 
03:58:51.309 --> 03:58:51.319 align:start position:0%
chair asked earlier relative to the size
 
03:58:53.910 --> 03:58:53.920 align:start position:0%
I I did asked the the Drone operator
 
03:58:55.910 --> 03:58:55.920 align:start position:0%
that I've been working with about what
 
03:58:57.870 --> 03:58:57.880 align:start position:0%
he was talking about for size under his
 
03:59:00.389 --> 03:59:00.399 align:start position:0%
you know this the section 44 and and he
 
03:59:02.149 --> 03:59:02.159 align:start position:0%
says well he says mine are upwards of
 
03:59:05.189 --> 03:59:05.199 align:start position:0%
400 pounds that help
 
03:59:07.670 --> 03:59:07.680 align:start position:0%
you yeah any help you could give us with
 
03:59:09.750 --> 03:59:09.760 align:start position:0%
that and you we want to write it so that
 
03:59:12.910 --> 03:59:12.920 align:start position:0%
it's accurate and helpful and if it's 55
 
03:59:14.710 --> 03:59:14.720 align:start position:0%
lbs it needs to be 400b then we're not
 
03:59:17.269 --> 03:59:17.279 align:start position:0%
doing that so anything you could do be
 
03:59:20.710 --> 03:59:20.720 align:start position:0%
would be great thank you thank you and
 
03:59:30.269 --> 03:59:30.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:32.790 --> 03:59:32.800 align:start position:0%
cleanup thank you Mr chairman members of
 
03:59:34.070 --> 03:59:34.080 align:start position:0%
the committee I am still the
 
03:59:35.189 --> 03:59:35.199 align:start position:0%
Commissioner of
 
03:59:40.269 --> 03:59:40.279 align:start position:0%
Agriculture um and you know I'll support
 
03:59:42.950 --> 03:59:42.960 align:start position:0%
uh what the executive director just had
 
03:59:45.429 --> 03:59:45.439 align:start position:0%
to say I mean uh in support of the bill
 
03:59:47.070 --> 03:59:47.080 align:start position:0%
with the amendment of 20 feet I think
 
03:59:49.950 --> 03:59:49.960 align:start position:0%
that it is much more environmentally
 
03:59:52.550 --> 03:59:52.560 align:start position:0%
friendly although currently we don't
 
03:59:54.830 --> 03:59:54.840 align:start position:0%
have to the best of my knowledge anyone
 
03:59:57.790 --> 03:59:57.800 align:start position:0%
licensed to spray with helicopters or
 
04:00:00.030 --> 04:00:00.040 align:start position:0%
planes and have probably not had anyone
 
04:00:03.950 --> 04:00:03.960 align:start position:0%
for decades doing that so it is spraying
 
04:00:06.389 --> 04:00:06.399 align:start position:0%
from the ground which uh question
 
04:00:08.950 --> 04:00:08.960 align:start position:0%
earlier was about how high that would
 
04:00:12.030 --> 04:00:12.040 align:start position:0%
have to go I don't know for sure but I
 
04:00:13.550 --> 04:00:13.560 align:start position:0%
would certainly say when you're spraying
 
04:00:16.550 --> 04:00:16.560 align:start position:0%
anything up it's going to probably have
 
04:00:18.429 --> 04:00:18.439 align:start position:0%
to go higher because it's going to be
 
04:00:20.990 --> 04:00:21.000 align:start position:0%
trying to reach into the the field and
 
04:00:23.790 --> 04:00:23.800 align:start position:0%
that's going to uh lend to more drift
 
04:00:25.469 --> 04:00:25.479 align:start position:0%
than something that is going down and
 
04:00:27.590 --> 04:00:27.600 align:start position:0%
obviously they're going to be uh
 
04:00:29.790 --> 04:00:29.800 align:start position:0%
spraying in in any time they're spraying
 
04:00:32.030 --> 04:00:32.040 align:start position:0%
their spray when there is you know as
 
04:00:34.269 --> 04:00:34.279 align:start position:0%
little wind as possible but I think this
 
04:00:36.389 --> 04:00:36.399 align:start position:0%
really is the most environmentally
 
04:00:39.870 --> 04:00:39.880 align:start position:0%
friendly way to do this and obviously 50
 
04:00:42.910 --> 04:00:42.920 align:start position:0%
50 pounds is not enough to make this
 
04:00:47.269 --> 04:00:47.279 align:start position:0%
practicable uh and so I hope that uh the
 
04:00:49.590 --> 04:00:49.600 align:start position:0%
chair and the executive director find a
 
04:00:51.550 --> 04:00:51.560 align:start position:0%
solution to this because I think it is
 
04:00:53.590 --> 04:00:53.600 align:start position:0%
something that is is very much needed in
 
04:00:56.269 --> 04:00:56.279 align:start position:0%
for agriculture in New Hampshire okay
 
04:00:59.229 --> 04:00:59.239 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions for the
 
04:01:01.389 --> 04:01:01.399 align:start position:0%

I don't know it's the end of August
 
04:01:40.910 --> 04:01:40.920 align:start position:0%
beginning of September we started
 
04:01:43.269 --> 04:01:43.279 align:start position:0%
pushing so we could determine what we
 
04:01:46.110 --> 04:01:46.120 align:start position:0%
needed to do to allow the use of
 
04:01:49.950 --> 04:01:49.960 align:start position:0%
drones where I see it being used with
 
04:01:53.349 --> 04:01:53.359 align:start position:0%
respect to dairy farms Rob Johnson
 
04:01:56.750 --> 04:01:56.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned bur cucumber bur cucumber is a
 
04:02:00.950 --> 04:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
weed that germinates late June July so
 
04:02:03.550 --> 04:02:03.560 align:start position:0%
the pre-emergent herbicides have lost
 
04:02:07.110 --> 04:02:07.120 align:start position:0%
their res residual effect by that time
 
04:02:10.070 --> 04:02:10.080 align:start position:0%
buru cber will climb up and canopy out
 
04:02:11.870 --> 04:02:11.880 align:start position:0%
over the top of
 
04:02:15.429 --> 04:02:15.439 align:start position:0%
cornfields right now it's sprayed with
 
04:02:18.189 --> 04:02:18.199 align:start position:0%
what we call a self-propelled sprayer um
 
04:02:20.990 --> 04:02:21.000 align:start position:0%
it's operated on the ground somebody
 
04:02:24.710 --> 04:02:24.720 align:start position:0%
goes in and corn will often be 10 to 12
 
04:02:27.790 --> 04:02:27.800 align:start position:0%
feet high so it's very high the
 
04:02:29.950 --> 04:02:29.960 align:start position:0%
clearance on the sprayer underneath the
 
04:02:33.670 --> 04:02:33.680 align:start position:0%
sprayer itself is maybe four 4 and 1/2
 
04:02:36.269 --> 04:02:36.279 align:start position:0%
ft underneath the booms it can get up to
 
04:02:39.830 --> 04:02:39.840 align:start position:0%
10 or 11 feet but going in with the
 
04:02:42.750 --> 04:02:42.760 align:start position:0%
sprayer you are running some corn over
 
04:02:45.830 --> 04:02:45.840 align:start position:0%
so you are damaging the crop also you
 
04:02:48.830 --> 04:02:48.840 align:start position:0%
cannot see the specific areas of the
 
04:02:52.269 --> 04:02:52.279 align:start position:0%
field that has bur cucumber in it so
 
04:02:53.990 --> 04:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
typically the whole field is being
 
04:02:56.870 --> 04:02:56.880 align:start position:0%
sprayed if it's a 30 acre field you go
 
04:03:00.870 --> 04:03:00.880 align:start position:0%
in and you spray the Whole 30 Acres um
 
04:03:04.070 --> 04:03:04.080 align:start position:0%
using a drone they can determine where
 
04:03:06.990 --> 04:03:07.000 align:start position:0%
the cucumber is that needs to be sprayed
 
04:03:10.349 --> 04:03:10.359 align:start position:0%
and go in and do spot spraying so it
 
04:03:13.309 --> 04:03:13.319 align:start position:0%
will result in less pesticides being
 
04:03:16.269 --> 04:03:16.279 align:start position:0%
used so that's very environmentally
 
04:03:21.110 --> 04:03:21.120 align:start position:0%
friendly um and I realize there's
 
04:03:24.110 --> 04:03:24.120 align:start position:0%
probably some concerns with
 
04:03:26.030 --> 04:03:26.040 align:start position:0%
neonicotinoids okay I believe the
 
04:03:27.790 --> 04:03:27.800 align:start position:0%
beekeepers are
 
04:03:31.950 --> 04:03:31.960 align:start position:0%
concerned so neonix in forage production
 
04:03:35.469 --> 04:03:35.479 align:start position:0%
such as corn silage is basically put on
 
04:03:37.870 --> 04:03:37.880 align:start position:0%
the corn seed when it's before its
 
04:03:41.910 --> 04:03:41.920 align:start position:0%
planted it's a dry powder that goes
 
04:03:45.349 --> 04:03:45.359 align:start position:0%
on the chemicals are herbicides that are
 
04:03:48.349 --> 04:03:48.359 align:start position:0%
used to take care of the bur cucumber do
 
04:03:52.950 --> 04:03:52.960 align:start position:0%
not have any neon in them so that the
 
04:03:56.630 --> 04:03:56.640 align:start position:0%
the concern for neonix being aily
 
04:04:02.910 --> 04:04:02.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:05.469 --> 04:04:05.479 align:start position:0%
concern are there any
 
04:04:08.309 --> 04:04:08.319 align:start position:0%
questions repres Jal thank you Mr chair
 
04:04:11.750 --> 04:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
it's good to see you again yeah uh
 
04:04:15.429 --> 04:04:15.439 align:start position:0%
so I really appreciate the the
 
04:04:17.750 --> 04:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
discussion about uh the neonix because
 
04:04:19.189 --> 04:04:19.199 align:start position:0%
that was yes we have been hearing from
 
04:04:21.349 --> 04:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
beekeeper so that definitely uh
 
04:04:23.349 --> 04:04:23.359 align:start position:0%
clarifies that I appreciate that I just
 
04:04:25.670 --> 04:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
had a question about something you said
 
04:04:27.670 --> 04:04:27.680 align:start position:0%
which does strike me as a really great
 
04:04:29.990 --> 04:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
point about being able to identify
 
04:04:32.189 --> 04:04:32.199 align:start position:0%
specific areas right and so would that
 
04:04:34.349 --> 04:04:34.359 align:start position:0%
be kind of a a just trying to imagine
 
04:04:35.590 --> 04:04:35.600 align:start position:0%
the process would it be kind of a
 
04:04:37.269 --> 04:04:37.279 align:start position:0%
two-stage process in the sense that
 
04:04:38.750 --> 04:04:38.760 align:start position:0%
there would be a preliminary kind of
 
04:04:42.910 --> 04:04:42.920 align:start position:0%
survey with the Drone U I'm just trying
 
04:04:44.710 --> 04:04:44.720 align:start position:0%
to imagine how find those specific
 
04:04:47.269 --> 04:04:47.279 align:start position:0%
places it sounds like the Dr do have
 
04:04:49.710 --> 04:04:49.720 align:start position:0%
cameras on them so you could go up and
 
04:04:51.670 --> 04:04:51.680 align:start position:0%
determine where it is and I expect when
 
04:04:54.510 --> 04:04:54.520 align:start position:0%
he's in transport from spraying one area
 
04:04:57.030 --> 04:04:57.040 align:start position:0%
to spraying another if he goes up to 50
 
04:05:00.510 --> 04:05:00.520 align:start position:0%
feet he will be able to see that and go
 
04:05:03.149 --> 04:05:03.159 align:start position:0%
right to that area may I follow and I'm
 
04:05:04.550 --> 04:05:04.560 align:start position:0%
just so would that would happen during
 
04:05:07.149 --> 04:05:07.159 align:start position:0%
the spraying or would there okay and and
 
04:05:10.389 --> 04:05:10.399 align:start position:0%
typically so I'm scouting fields for I
 
04:05:13.189 --> 04:05:13.199 align:start position:0%
work with about 25,000 acres and I Scout
 
04:05:13.199 --> 04:05:14.149 align:start position:0%
work with about 25,000 acres and I Scout
fields

04:05:14.149 --> 04:05:14.159 align:start position:0%
fields
 
04:05:17.149 --> 04:05:17.159 align:start position:0%
July and August and we really don't
 
04:05:20.149 --> 04:05:20.159 align:start position:0%
start seeing the Cucumber until August
 
04:05:23.349 --> 04:05:23.359 align:start position:0%
when it comes up in canopies so we
 
04:05:25.510 --> 04:05:25.520 align:start position:0%
identify there's cucumber there we
 
04:05:27.510 --> 04:05:27.520 align:start position:0%
identify it really needs to be taken
 
04:05:30.870 --> 04:05:30.880 align:start position:0%
care of because um in some instances
 
04:05:32.870 --> 04:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
it'll canopy over the corn and actually
 
04:05:36.870 --> 04:05:36.880 align:start position:0%
start pulling the corn down okay um and
 
04:05:39.990 --> 04:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
then from there the Drone operator would
 
04:05:41.950 --> 04:05:41.960 align:start position:0%
identify the areas of the field that
 
04:05:44.309 --> 04:05:44.319 align:start position:0%
really needed to be sprayed if you were
 
04:05:47.229 --> 04:05:47.239 align:start position:0%
in a self-propelled sprayer the operator
 
04:05:49.990 --> 04:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
is sitting there about 12 feet in the
 
04:05:51.870 --> 04:05:51.880 align:start position:0%
air but when you're in 12 to 10 foot
 
04:05:53.550 --> 04:05:53.560 align:start position:0%
tall corn all you're seeing is the top
 
04:05:57.510 --> 04:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
of the Corn so okay thank you very much
 
04:05:59.870 --> 04:05:59.880 align:start position:0%
was that muray thank you Mr chair thank
 
04:06:04.189 --> 04:06:04.199 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um not um is
 
04:06:06.750 --> 04:06:06.760 align:start position:0%
it true that not all drones have
 
04:06:11.389 --> 04:06:11.399 align:start position:0%
cameras that is true but this would be a
 
04:06:13.229 --> 04:06:13.239 align:start position:0%
commercial operator that would come in
 
04:06:17.189 --> 04:06:17.199 align:start position:0%
to do it okay and even um if a Dairy
 
04:06:19.550 --> 04:06:19.560 align:start position:0%
Farmer were to get their own drone they
 
04:06:22.149 --> 04:06:22.159 align:start position:0%
would get a camera so they could see it
 
04:06:24.229 --> 04:06:24.239 align:start position:0%
would be useless to go up without having
 
04:06:24.239 --> 04:06:25.269 align:start position:0%
would be useless to go up without having
a

04:06:25.269 --> 04:06:25.279 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:06:29.149 --> 04:06:29.159 align:start position:0%
camera follow up yes ma'am so would it
 
04:06:31.830 --> 04:06:31.840 align:start position:0%
make sense for there to be a requirement
 
04:06:35.550 --> 04:06:35.560 align:start position:0%
however though for there to be usage of
 
04:06:39.389 --> 04:06:39.399 align:start position:0%
a drone with camera capability to avoid
 
04:06:42.510 --> 04:06:42.520 align:start position:0%
the potential of indiscriminate
 
04:06:42.520 --> 04:06:44.990 align:start position:0%
the potential of indiscriminate
application

04:06:44.990 --> 04:06:45.000 align:start position:0%
application
 
04:06:47.950 --> 04:06:47.960 align:start position:0%
um I guess I wouldn't see that as
 
04:06:51.149 --> 04:06:51.159 align:start position:0%
necessary because the Drone operator the
 
04:06:53.550 --> 04:06:53.560 align:start position:0%
only way he is operating that drone is
 
04:06:56.110 --> 04:06:56.120 align:start position:0%
with a camera to know where he is in the
 
04:07:01.590 --> 04:07:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:04.630 --> 04:07:04.640 align:start position:0%
works okay any further
 
04:07:06.349 --> 04:07:06.359 align:start position:0%
questions thank you sir for your
 
04:07:08.229 --> 04:07:08.239 align:start position:0%
testimony I appreciate it thank
 
04:07:12.510 --> 04:07:12.520 align:start position:0%
you I'd like to call Mr Tom saer
 
04:07:12.520 --> 04:07:22.389 align:start position:0%
you I'd like to call Mr Tom saer
please

04:07:22.389 --> 04:07:22.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:24.590 --> 04:07:24.600 align:start position:0%
hi my name's Tom Sawyer I'm a Dairy
 
04:07:27.950 --> 04:07:27.960 align:start position:0%
Farmer from walpool New Hampshire we put
 
04:07:31.830 --> 04:07:31.840 align:start position:0%
in about 250 acres of corn silage and I
 
04:07:33.630 --> 04:07:33.640 align:start position:0%
was one of the ones that was had a
 
04:07:36.590 --> 04:07:36.600 align:start position:0%
problem last year in August I looked
 
04:07:38.950 --> 04:07:38.960 align:start position:0%
into this you know trying to get a drone
 
04:07:41.990 --> 04:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
person from New York to come and spray
 
04:07:45.550 --> 04:07:45.560 align:start position:0%
my Fields because it was August and and
 
04:07:47.830 --> 04:07:47.840 align:start position:0%
uh he was more than willing to come and
 
04:07:49.950 --> 04:07:49.960 align:start position:0%
he was we went back and forth for about
 
04:07:51.750 --> 04:07:51.760 align:start position:0%
a week and he said we just can't do it
 
04:07:54.469 --> 04:07:54.479 align:start position:0%
because of the pesticide rules and and
 
04:07:59.070 --> 04:07:59.080 align:start position:0%
that so that's um the big things that
 
04:07:59.080 --> 04:08:00.830 align:start position:0%
that so that's um the big things that
you

04:08:00.830 --> 04:08:00.840 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:08:03.349 --> 04:08:03.359 align:start position:0%
know we we went in and sprayed it with a
 
04:08:05.469 --> 04:08:05.479 align:start position:0%
land you know drove over a lot of corn
 
04:08:07.149 --> 04:08:07.159 align:start position:0%
and it was better than not spraying it
 
04:08:09.590 --> 04:08:09.600 align:start position:0%
but we lost a you know on the acreage
 
04:08:10.790 --> 04:08:10.800 align:start position:0%
that we had to
 
04:08:14.550 --> 04:08:14.560 align:start position:0%
respray we lost a lot of corn and
 
04:08:17.429 --> 04:08:17.439 align:start position:0%
so we were just hoping to get this you
 
04:08:19.910 --> 04:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
know so we could do it this year if if
 
04:08:21.149 --> 04:08:21.159 align:start position:0%
we need
 
04:08:25.149 --> 04:08:25.159 align:start position:0%
to um I talked with him some and
 
04:08:27.830 --> 04:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
hopefully it'll come to get it through
 
04:08:29.269 --> 04:08:29.279 align:start position:0%
and get this
 
04:08:33.309 --> 04:08:33.319 align:start position:0%
done and uh I'm sorry are are you okay
 
04:08:36.510 --> 04:08:36.520 align:start position:0%
so and this bill meets the requirements
 
04:08:39.109 --> 04:08:39.119 align:start position:0%
um that would allow you to do that if
 
04:08:40.750 --> 04:08:40.760 align:start position:0%
this bill passed would you be allowed to
 
04:08:43.269 --> 04:08:43.279 align:start position:0%
do that as you planned that's what I was
 
04:08:44.990 --> 04:08:45.000 align:start position:0%
hop hoping but now they brought up a
 
04:08:46.950 --> 04:08:46.960 align:start position:0%
couple other things that hopefully we
 
04:08:50.510 --> 04:08:50.520 align:start position:0%
can get worked out but that
 
04:08:54.109 --> 04:08:54.119 align:start position:0%
was yes that's that's what okay the gist
 
04:08:56.630 --> 04:08:56.640 align:start position:0%
of it was cool
 
04:08:59.109 --> 04:08:59.119 align:start position:0%
it's and there there are some different
 
04:09:01.429 --> 04:09:01.439 align:start position:0%
ways you know like this spot spraying
 
04:09:03.750 --> 04:09:03.760 align:start position:0%
there's also some other you know like
 
04:09:07.149 --> 04:09:07.159 align:start position:0%
they come in um the person that I was
 
04:09:09.630 --> 04:09:09.640 align:start position:0%
working with he had uh can't remember
 
04:09:11.389 --> 04:09:11.399 align:start position:0%
how many drones he has but it's like
 
04:09:13.189 --> 04:09:13.199 align:start position:0%
three or four drones and he you know
 
04:09:15.710 --> 04:09:15.720 align:start position:0%
like he sends one up and starts spraying
 
04:09:17.990 --> 04:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
and sends another one up and it's
 
04:09:21.389 --> 04:09:21.399 align:start position:0%
computerized M you know mapped out he
 
04:09:25.550 --> 04:09:25.560 align:start position:0%
can do it different ways with maps um so
 
04:09:26.590 --> 04:09:26.600 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
04:09:29.349 --> 04:09:29.359 align:start position:0%
like if he's doing a you know like a
 
04:09:32.670 --> 04:09:32.680 align:start position:0%
certain field of that square right there
 
04:09:35.269 --> 04:09:35.279 align:start position:0%
it would be computerized and the drones
 
04:09:38.790 --> 04:09:38.800 align:start position:0%
would just spray it and then come
 
04:09:42.229 --> 04:09:42.239 align:start position:0%
home the side of the field whatever but
 
04:09:43.990 --> 04:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
and then if your spa
 
04:09:46.910 --> 04:09:46.920 align:start position:0%
a you can get up there and see where you
 
04:09:50.510 --> 04:09:50.520 align:start position:0%
need to spray and go to that spot and
 
04:09:50.520 --> 04:09:51.590 align:start position:0%
need to spray and go to that spot and
spray

04:09:51.590 --> 04:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
spray
 
04:09:54.229 --> 04:09:54.239 align:start position:0%
it fairly accurate Fair reliable would
 
04:09:56.349 --> 04:09:56.359 align:start position:0%
you say very accurate from what I've
 
04:09:58.189 --> 04:09:58.199 align:start position:0%
read I've never done it
 
04:10:01.269 --> 04:10:01.279 align:start position:0%
and as Tom bodri said I I don't believe
 
04:10:03.269 --> 04:10:03.279 align:start position:0%
that you'll see Farmers themselves doing
 
04:10:05.030 --> 04:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
it because you've got to get licensed to
 
04:10:08.429 --> 04:10:08.439 align:start position:0%
fly the Drone and pesticide application
 
04:10:11.070 --> 04:10:11.080 align:start position:0%
and a lot of farms have gone to hiring
 
04:10:13.309 --> 04:10:13.319 align:start position:0%
it done just because it's probably
 
04:10:14.790 --> 04:10:14.800 align:start position:0%
probably safer they know the rules
 
04:10:17.429 --> 04:10:17.439 align:start position:0%
better and but I know they can like
 
04:10:20.109 --> 04:10:20.119 align:start position:0%
directionally spray so if they're going
 
04:10:22.229 --> 04:10:22.239 align:start position:0%
along instead of just spraying straight
 
04:10:25.790 --> 04:10:25.800 align:start position:0%
down they may tilt a little bit the the
 
04:10:31.030 --> 04:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
nozzles and stuff like that so it's I
 
04:10:33.389 --> 04:10:33.399 align:start position:0%
think from what everything I've been
 
04:10:37.910 --> 04:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
told it's very little drift
 
04:10:41.030 --> 04:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
and that's what we're shooting for oh
 
04:10:43.990 --> 04:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
thank you any represent big yes thank
 
04:10:47.229 --> 04:10:47.239 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um
 
04:10:50.830 --> 04:10:50.840 align:start position:0%
so one of the issues with drift is that
 
04:10:54.830 --> 04:10:54.840 align:start position:0%
if you are um spraying in high wind
 
04:10:56.550 --> 04:10:56.560 align:start position:0%
conditions then drift is much more
 
04:10:59.429 --> 04:10:59.439 align:start position:0%
likely uh would it be the case that if
 
04:11:01.229 --> 04:11:01.239 align:start position:0%
you're flying a drone if you were using
 
04:11:03.630 --> 04:11:03.640 align:start position:0%
a drone you you wouldn't be able to fly
 
04:11:05.070 --> 04:11:05.080 align:start position:0%
the Drone in the conditions that would
 
04:11:07.750 --> 04:11:07.760 align:start position:0%
be problematic for drift correct okay
 
04:11:10.750 --> 04:11:10.760 align:start position:0%
thank you they're more worry more about
 
04:11:12.710 --> 04:11:12.720 align:start position:0%
drift just because the drones the drones
 
04:11:15.469 --> 04:11:15.479 align:start position:0%
are very expensive ensive and so you
 
04:11:17.510 --> 04:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
know you don't want to go up with them
 
04:11:20.349 --> 04:11:20.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:22.630 --> 04:11:22.640 align:start position:0%
windy all right seeing no further
 
04:11:24.790 --> 04:11:24.800 align:start position:0%
questions I'd like to call thank you sir
 
04:11:27.269 --> 04:11:27.279 align:start position:0%
for your testimony we appreciate it and
 
04:11:29.590 --> 04:11:29.600 align:start position:0%
uh Jamie Jamie
 
04:11:32.229 --> 04:11:32.239 align:start position:0%
Robertson my son showed up and I will uh
 
04:11:34.510 --> 04:11:34.520 align:start position:0%
defer to my son I think he put in a card
 
04:11:37.990 --> 04:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
also um because he's the one who
 
04:11:42.590 --> 04:11:42.600 align:start position:0%
has and so you're sigh yes cool so you
 
04:11:44.429 --> 04:11:44.439 align:start position:0%
want me to D destroy
 
04:11:47.189 --> 04:11:47.199 align:start position:0%
this they're all over it he just saved
 
04:11:50.910 --> 04:11:50.920 align:start position:0%
us five minutes s I'd like to call S
 
04:11:50.920 --> 04:11:59.030 align:start position:0%
us five minutes s I'd like to call S
Robinson

04:11:59.030 --> 04:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:02.830 --> 04:12:02.840 align:start position:0%
please hi I'm s Robertson um I farm with
 
04:12:05.349 --> 04:12:05.359 align:start position:0%
my folks milk cows in hawkon New
 
04:12:08.630 --> 04:12:08.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and uh we also raise about 150
 
04:12:11.149 --> 04:12:11.159 align:start position:0%
to 200 acres of corn silage and then a
 
04:12:14.109 --> 04:12:14.119 align:start position:0%
few hundred acres of grass also um
 
04:12:17.510 --> 04:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
just uh speaking in support of the the
 
04:12:20.950 --> 04:12:20.960 align:start position:0%
bill so we can do the Drone spraying um
 
04:12:23.510 --> 04:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
as far as the bur cucumber is a huge
 
04:12:26.109 --> 04:12:26.119 align:start position:0%
headache for us um just to give you an
 
04:12:28.710 --> 04:12:28.720 align:start position:0%
idea you know when we've had issues with
 
04:12:32.990 --> 04:12:33.000 align:start position:0%
it not getting sprayed in time and um on
 
04:12:34.910 --> 04:12:34.920 align:start position:0%
certain Fields we've lost more than
 
04:12:38.149 --> 04:12:38.159 align:start position:0%
2third of the Corn that we we basically
 
04:12:39.990 --> 04:12:40.000 align:start position:0%
have to run it over with the trucks
 
04:12:42.670 --> 04:12:42.680 align:start position:0%
because the the Harvester won't pick it
 
04:12:44.790 --> 04:12:44.800 align:start position:0%
up it plugs the Harvester up so bad that
 
04:12:46.109 --> 04:12:46.119 align:start position:0%
we just end up running it over and
 
04:12:50.750 --> 04:12:50.760 align:start position:0%
leaving it in the field um and uh where
 
04:12:56.070 --> 04:12:56.080 align:start position:0%
we to avoid that we have gotten Uh
 
04:12:58.149 --> 04:12:58.159 align:start position:0%
custom operator in to spray with their
 
04:13:00.389 --> 04:13:00.399 align:start position:0%
self-propelled sprayer like we've heard
 
04:13:03.750 --> 04:13:03.760 align:start position:0%
a few times now um and that's that's
 
04:13:06.109 --> 04:13:06.119 align:start position:0%
saved us saved the corn for the most
 
04:13:07.389 --> 04:13:07.399 align:start position:0%
part but we still have you know the
 
04:13:09.189 --> 04:13:09.199 align:start position:0%
Wheel tracks through the field obviously
 
04:13:11.469 --> 04:13:11.479 align:start position:0%
are knocking down corn and damaging it
 
04:13:14.389 --> 04:13:14.399 align:start position:0%
which is better than 2/3 lost but but
 
04:13:15.990 --> 04:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
still an amount of damage that we could
 
04:13:19.309 --> 04:13:19.319 align:start position:0%
avoid with drones um as far as you know
 
04:13:22.030 --> 04:13:22.040 align:start position:0%
the height with it whether it's more
 
04:13:23.630 --> 04:13:23.640 align:start position:0%
like spraying from the ground or more
 
04:13:25.109 --> 04:13:25.119 align:start position:0%
like spraying from an airplane I think
 
04:13:27.550 --> 04:13:27.560 align:start position:0%
that question was asked earlier where
 
04:13:30.269 --> 04:13:30.279 align:start position:0%
with the custom operator their spray
 
04:13:32.830 --> 04:13:32.840 align:start position:0%
boom is you know around 10 feet off the
 
04:13:34.870 --> 04:13:34.880 align:start position:0%
ground already so it wouldn't be
 
04:13:36.590 --> 04:13:36.600 align:start position:0%
significantly different if we were
 
04:13:40.550 --> 04:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
flying a drone up to 20t you know and um
 
04:13:42.630 --> 04:13:42.640 align:start position:0%
the other thing that I've heard again I
 
04:13:45.950 --> 04:13:45.960 align:start position:0%
haven't like Tom was saying I haven't uh
 
04:13:48.750 --> 04:13:48.760 align:start position:0%
done any drone spraying myself but what
 
04:13:51.550 --> 04:13:51.560 align:start position:0%
talking with folks that do work with it
 
04:13:55.349 --> 04:13:55.359 align:start position:0%
the that down pressure air from the
 
04:13:58.429 --> 04:13:58.439 align:start position:0%
Drone propellers actually helps push the
 
04:14:01.109 --> 04:14:01.119 align:start position:0%
spray down and keep it from drifting
 
04:14:02.670 --> 04:14:02.680 align:start position:0%
away from the field from where you want
 
04:14:06.429 --> 04:14:06.439 align:start position:0%
it directed um I don't know if you guys
 
04:14:07.950 --> 04:14:07.960 align:start position:0%
for I don't know if you guys have seen
 
04:14:10.269 --> 04:14:10.279 align:start position:0%
any Burg cucumber familiar with it but
 
04:14:12.710 --> 04:14:12.720 align:start position:0%
the the corn fields over by the hospital
 
04:14:16.030 --> 04:14:16.040 align:start position:0%
off exit to on Clinton Street those deal
 
04:14:18.309 --> 04:14:18.319 align:start position:0%
those fields have had issues with bur
 
04:14:20.070 --> 04:14:20.080 align:start position:0%
cucumber and you can see it it'll climb
 
04:14:21.990 --> 04:14:22.000 align:start position:0%
right up it's got big wide leaves on it
 
04:14:23.990 --> 04:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
and it'll grow right over the top of it
 
04:14:27.990 --> 04:14:28.000 align:start position:0%
and knock it all down but um yeah so I I
 
04:14:31.550 --> 04:14:31.560 align:start position:0%
think it would be a real uh
 
04:14:34.149 --> 04:14:34.159 align:start position:0%
real important for
 
04:14:37.790 --> 04:14:37.800 align:start position:0%
us uh financially it would help us
 
04:14:40.189 --> 04:14:40.199 align:start position:0%
reduce our pesticide usage for the
 
04:14:42.309 --> 04:14:42.319 align:start position:0%
reasons that have been spoken to um and
 
04:14:44.349 --> 04:14:44.359 align:start position:0%
then the other thing thing is
 
04:14:48.070 --> 04:14:48.080 align:start position:0%
that as New Hampshire has got fewer and
 
04:14:51.950 --> 04:14:51.960 align:start position:0%
fewer dairy farms um there are it's
 
04:14:55.630 --> 04:14:55.640 align:start position:0%
harder for I think it's harder for uh
 
04:14:57.510 --> 04:14:57.520 align:start position:0%
applicators custom applicators to
 
04:15:00.950 --> 04:15:00.960 align:start position:0%
justify buying a three half or 3/4 of a
 
04:15:03.830 --> 04:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
million machine million dollar machine
 
04:15:05.469 --> 04:15:05.479 align:start position:0%
where the drones are much more
 
04:15:09.109 --> 04:15:09.119 align:start position:0%
affordable it they're easier to get um
 
04:15:12.070 --> 04:15:12.080 align:start position:0%
transport on roads you know on a trailer
 
04:15:13.590 --> 04:15:13.600 align:start position:0%
from field to field
 
04:15:15.030 --> 04:15:15.040 align:start position:0%
um I think that would be a really big
 
04:15:17.790 --> 04:15:17.800 align:start position:0%
Advantage too um for that would be
 
04:15:20.670 --> 04:15:20.680 align:start position:0%
specifically ADV advantageous for New
 
04:15:22.750 --> 04:15:22.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um I'll be happy to take any
 
04:15:24.790 --> 04:15:24.800 align:start position:0%
questions oh thank you very much
 
04:15:27.389 --> 04:15:27.399 align:start position:0%
representative viig just a clarification
 
04:15:29.269 --> 04:15:29.279 align:start position:0%
when you're talking about uh the Drone
 
04:15:31.870 --> 04:15:31.880 align:start position:0%
being more affordable than the half to
 
04:15:34.429 --> 04:15:34.439 align:start position:0%
3/4 million machine is that machine
 
04:15:37.030 --> 04:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
you're referring to the self-propelled
 
04:15:40.429 --> 04:15:40.439 align:start position:0%
ground spray rig yeah yeah okay
 
04:15:43.550 --> 04:15:43.560 align:start position:0%
thanks any other questions
 
04:15:45.269 --> 04:15:45.279 align:start position:0%
thank you sir appreciate your testimony
 
04:15:46.950 --> 04:15:46.960 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions and I'd like
 
04:15:48.189 --> 04:15:48.199 align:start position:0%
to call
 
04:15:59.990 --> 04:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:03.309 --> 04:16:03.319 align:start position:0%
creep good afternoon I'm Adam Creek uh
 
04:16:05.469 --> 04:16:05.479 align:start position:0%
got a dairy farm up in bosin New
 
04:16:08.630 --> 04:16:08.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um I grow about 400 acres of
 
04:16:10.870 --> 04:16:10.880 align:start position:0%
corn silage um I'm in support of this
 
04:16:13.269 --> 04:16:13.279 align:start position:0%
bill as I would believe it be
 
04:16:16.990 --> 04:16:17.000 align:start position:0%
advantageous for us um as far as
 
04:16:21.149 --> 04:16:21.159 align:start position:0%
reducing our fuel usage our chemical
 
04:16:23.950 --> 04:16:23.960 align:start position:0%
usage um getting out on the fields when
 
04:16:26.030 --> 04:16:26.040 align:start position:0%
a lot of times you can't with a tractor
 
04:16:27.429 --> 04:16:27.439 align:start position:0%
you know if you get a big rain event
 
04:16:29.990 --> 04:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
which seems like happens a lot lately uh
 
04:16:31.830 --> 04:16:31.840 align:start position:0%
usually could go a week before you can
 
04:16:33.269 --> 04:16:33.279 align:start position:0%
get out there with a tractor you know
 
04:16:34.429 --> 04:16:34.439 align:start position:0%
with a drone you can get out there the
 
04:16:38.990 --> 04:16:39.000 align:start position:0%
next day um it's uh you know be short
 
04:16:40.990 --> 04:16:41.000 align:start position:0%
and sweet but I'm in support of this
 
04:16:42.910 --> 04:16:42.920 align:start position:0%
belt oh that's perfect thank you sir

all
right

04:18:17.349 --> 04:18:17.359 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:18:20.189 --> 04:18:20.199 align:start position:0%
okay I am going to open up the hearing
 
04:18:23.910 --> 04:18:23.920 align:start position:0%
for HB 1703 relative to the sale of
 
04:18:27.349 --> 04:18:27.359 align:start position:0%
kangaroo and Caribou meat and today uh
 
04:18:30.189 --> 04:18:30.199 align:start position:0%
we have representative Granger to
 
04:18:32.870 --> 04:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
introduce the bill to us good afternoon
 
04:18:37.510 --> 04:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:40.910 --> 04:18:40.920 align:start position:0%
agriculture uh thank you madam chair um
 
04:18:42.750 --> 04:18:42.760 align:start position:0%
this bill is pretty simple it uh Le
 
04:18:44.710 --> 04:18:44.720 align:start position:0%
utilizes kangaroo and Caribou farming
 
04:18:47.790 --> 04:18:47.800 align:start position:0%
for meat production um we just uh
 
04:18:50.189 --> 04:18:50.199 align:start position:0%
instead of rewriting a bunch of law we
 
04:18:52.750 --> 04:18:52.760 align:start position:0%
just put kangaroo and Caribou in lists
 
04:18:54.269 --> 04:18:54.279 align:start position:0%
of uh similar animals so they'll be
 
04:18:56.510 --> 04:18:56.520 align:start position:0%
regulated basically the same way I can
 
04:18:59.269 --> 04:18:59.279 align:start position:0%
take any questions okay first of all I
 
04:19:01.109 --> 04:19:01.119 align:start position:0%
want to ask committee members do you all
 
04:19:04.349 --> 04:19:04.359 align:start position:0%
have a copy of the bill took it off the
 
04:19:07.109 --> 04:19:07.119 align:start position:0%
counter you took it off the counter okay
 
04:19:09.950 --> 04:19:09.960 align:start position:0%
uh I don't think I have a copy
 
04:19:14.790 --> 04:19:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:16.990 --> 04:19:17.000 align:start position:0%
all right uh let's see anybody have any
 
04:19:19.710 --> 04:19:19.720 align:start position:0%
questions regarding
 
04:19:22.510 --> 04:19:22.520 align:start position:0%
um representative dsy okay thank you
 
04:19:25.750 --> 04:19:25.760 align:start position:0%
madam chair um representative Granger uh
 
04:19:27.750 --> 04:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
where did this bill come from was it a
 
04:19:32.670 --> 04:19:32.680 align:start position:0%
constituent or um how um was this
 
04:19:35.429 --> 04:19:35.439 align:start position:0%
addressed erased as a problem in New
 
04:19:37.630 --> 04:19:37.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire can you give us any background
 
04:19:39.670 --> 04:19:39.680 align:start position:0%
yeah so uh one of my constituents uh
 
04:19:41.309 --> 04:19:41.319 align:start position:0%
runs a nonprofit called the freest State
 
04:19:44.670 --> 04:19:44.680 align:start position:0%
Food Network and they want to uh have
 
04:19:45.870 --> 04:19:45.880 align:start position:0%
they come from a state where kangaroo
 
04:19:48.510 --> 04:19:48.520 align:start position:0%
farming is legal um also there is
 
04:19:50.349 --> 04:19:50.359 align:start position:0%
another constituent who uh wants to
 
04:19:53.950 --> 04:19:53.960 align:start position:0%
raise Caribou as well and um the we
 
04:19:55.309 --> 04:19:55.319 align:start position:0%
figured the best way to do it is just
 
04:19:57.070 --> 04:19:57.080 align:start position:0%
regulate it the same way similar animals
 
04:19:57.080 --> 04:19:59.830 align:start position:0%
regulate it the same way similar animals
are

04:19:59.830 --> 04:19:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:02.030 --> 04:20:02.040 align:start position:0%
regulated represent
 
04:20:05.070 --> 04:20:05.080 align:start position:0%
Penza so I had no idea that this was a
 
04:20:08.269 --> 04:20:08.279 align:start position:0%
thing and um and it was in a chat that
 
04:20:11.229 --> 04:20:11.239 align:start position:0%
I'm in just recently and a whole group
 
04:20:13.349 --> 04:20:13.359 align:start position:0%
of people were talking about
 
04:20:16.389 --> 04:20:16.399 align:start position:0%
um reps and others about how they
 
04:20:19.790 --> 04:20:19.800 align:start position:0%
purchase um kangaroo meat and um Caribou
 
04:20:21.990 --> 04:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
meat so can you give a little background
 
04:20:24.990 --> 04:20:25.000 align:start position:0%
please because you know this um you know
 
04:20:27.990 --> 04:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
even to me it seemed um a little like
 
04:20:31.389 --> 04:20:31.399 align:start position:0%
out there but about that process and
 
04:20:34.229 --> 04:20:34.239 align:start position:0%
where PE how people are purchasing that
 
04:20:35.750 --> 04:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
meat now can you give a little
 
04:20:38.229 --> 04:20:38.239 align:start position:0%
background please uh certainly uh so
 
04:20:40.670 --> 04:20:40.680 align:start position:0%
right now most meat so kangaroo is a
 
04:20:42.670 --> 04:20:42.680 align:start position:0%
very common thing to eat in Australia
 
04:20:44.990 --> 04:20:45.000 align:start position:0%
because that's where kangaroos are um I
 
04:20:46.710 --> 04:20:46.720 align:start position:0%
would like to say that I know this from
 
04:20:48.990 --> 04:20:49.000 align:start position:0%
firsthand experience but uh I've never
 
04:20:50.269 --> 04:20:50.279 align:start position:0%
actually eaten kangaroo because it's
 
04:20:53.149 --> 04:20:53.159 align:start position:0%
incredibly expensive um supposedly it's
 
04:20:56.030 --> 04:20:56.040 align:start position:0%
kind of like beef mixed with rabbit it's
 
04:20:58.429 --> 04:20:58.439 align:start position:0%
a somewhat gamier version of meat uh
 
04:21:00.750 --> 04:21:00.760 align:start position:0%
beef supposedly it's a lot leaner than
 
04:21:03.149 --> 04:21:03.159 align:start position:0%
beef and uh therefore healthier
 
04:21:06.830 --> 04:21:06.840 align:start position:0%
depending on uh uh on your specific diet
 
04:21:09.590 --> 04:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
uh other parts of the country do have
 
04:21:12.790 --> 04:21:12.800 align:start position:0%
kangaroo as a a legal animal to raise
 
04:21:15.510 --> 04:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
and butcher if you're coming if you're
 
04:21:17.389 --> 04:21:17.399 align:start position:0%
importing uh if you're buying the most
 
04:21:18.870 --> 04:21:18.880 align:start position:0%
commonly available kangaroo which is
 
04:21:22.189 --> 04:21:22.199 align:start position:0%
from Australia um it is a a fairly Hefty
 
04:21:25.389 --> 04:21:25.399 align:start position:0%
tax my understanding is $15 per pound
 
04:21:27.469 --> 04:21:27.479 align:start position:0%
which is uh makes makes it outrageously
 
04:21:29.630 --> 04:21:29.640 align:start position:0%
expensive for anybody to purchase
 
04:21:32.229 --> 04:21:32.239 align:start position:0%
kangaroo meat um I don't know that there
 
04:21:34.469 --> 04:21:34.479 align:start position:0%
is a large demand for kangaroo meat but
 
04:21:35.910 --> 04:21:35.920 align:start position:0%
there certainly is some demand because I
 
04:21:38.349 --> 04:21:38.359 align:start position:0%
demand it and uh so there's at least a
 
04:21:41.389 --> 04:21:41.399 align:start position:0%
little bit and um so if if we did
 
04:21:43.149 --> 04:21:43.159 align:start position:0%
legalize it then
 
04:21:44.750 --> 04:21:44.760 align:start position:0%
not every farmer would be raising
 
04:21:46.710 --> 04:21:46.720 align:start position:0%
kangaroo I'm pretty sure but there's
 
04:21:48.630 --> 04:21:48.640 align:start position:0%
probably a few that will and uh that
 
04:21:50.429 --> 04:21:50.439 align:start position:0%
would just enable that specific Market
 
04:21:52.870 --> 04:21:52.880 align:start position:0%
to exist representative
 
04:21:55.469 --> 04:21:55.479 align:start position:0%
com thank you madam chair and uh thank
 
04:21:56.550 --> 04:21:56.560 align:start position:0%
you representative for taking my
 
04:21:59.149 --> 04:21:59.159 align:start position:0%
question um could you elaborate on what
 
04:22:01.309 --> 04:22:01.319 align:start position:0%
states currently allow the raising of
 
04:22:03.670 --> 04:22:03.680 align:start position:0%
kangaroos my understanding is Wisconsin
 
04:22:09.109 --> 04:22:09.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:12.269 --> 04:22:12.279 align:start position:0%
Texas um well I'll tell you I do know
 
04:22:16.109 --> 04:22:16.119 align:start position:0%
that that uh kangaroo meat is used for
 
04:22:18.550 --> 04:22:18.560 align:start position:0%
um like cat and dog
 
04:22:23.149 --> 04:22:23.159 align:start position:0%
food um I know that in California
 
04:22:27.510 --> 04:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
though um because my daughter has a cat
 
04:22:31.070 --> 04:22:31.080 align:start position:0%
that's allergic to most foods and her
 
04:22:34.990 --> 04:22:35.000 align:start position:0%
vet recommended um that she get some
 
04:22:38.269 --> 04:22:38.279 align:start position:0%
kangaroo meat for the cat um the only
 
04:22:40.790 --> 04:22:40.800 align:start position:0%
problem is that that's banned in
 
04:22:43.109 --> 04:22:43.119 align:start position:0%
California kangaroo meat
 
04:22:46.550 --> 04:22:46.560 align:start position:0%
so um so that's how I know that uh you
 
04:22:51.429 --> 04:22:51.439 align:start position:0%
know there it is a a product that is um
 
04:22:55.149 --> 04:22:55.159 align:start position:0%
used in animal food so um I know that
 
04:22:58.269 --> 04:22:58.279 align:start position:0%
not just people eat it representative
 
04:23:01.870 --> 04:23:01.880 align:start position:0%
ktoa thank you madam chair um having
 
04:23:04.070 --> 04:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
heard a discussion regarding kangaroos
 
04:23:06.349 --> 04:23:06.359 align:start position:0%
just recently in this
 
04:23:06.359 --> 04:23:08.389 align:start position:0%
just recently in this
committee

04:23:08.389 --> 04:23:08.399 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:23:12.590 --> 04:23:12.600 align:start position:0%
um uh but and about their personalities
 
04:23:16.469 --> 04:23:16.479 align:start position:0%
and and things like that um what type of
 
04:23:18.750 --> 04:23:18.760 align:start position:0%
infrastructure uh would you need to
 
04:23:21.469 --> 04:23:21.479 align:start position:0%
raise kangaroos do you have any idea if
 
04:23:24.309 --> 04:23:24.319 align:start position:0%
if if your infrastructure will my
 
04:23:25.550 --> 04:23:25.560 align:start position:0%
understanding is and I'm not I'm not a
 
04:23:28.309 --> 04:23:28.319 align:start position:0%
kangaroo farmer so you know just going
 
04:23:30.469 --> 04:23:30.479 align:start position:0%
to give you the research that I've uh
 
04:23:33.109 --> 04:23:33.119 align:start position:0%
found if you are capable of
 
04:23:35.030 --> 04:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
containing you know some of the animals
 
04:23:36.990 --> 04:23:37.000 align:start position:0%
that are already on the list such as bis
 
04:23:39.469 --> 04:23:39.479 align:start position:0%
you should have absolutely no trouble um
 
04:23:42.469 --> 04:23:42.479 align:start position:0%
with kangaroo they do hop um they are
 
04:23:45.189 --> 04:23:45.199 align:start position:0%
capable of climbing but um they are
 
04:23:46.750 --> 04:23:46.760 align:start position:0%
containable and they are capable of
 
04:23:50.830 --> 04:23:50.840 align:start position:0%
being farmed um at at any rate it is up
 
04:23:53.109 --> 04:23:53.119 align:start position:0%
to the farmer if you're uh worried about
 
04:23:54.990 --> 04:23:55.000 align:start position:0%
them getting out and a nice thing about
 
04:23:57.149 --> 04:23:57.159 align:start position:0%
kangaroos is they have basically zero
 
04:24:00.469 --> 04:24:00.479 align:start position:0%
natural viability in this area um so if
 
04:24:02.790 --> 04:24:02.800 align:start position:0%
they did Escape there's almost no chance
 
04:24:05.109 --> 04:24:05.119 align:start position:0%
that they would become an invasive
 
04:24:07.590 --> 04:24:07.600 align:start position:0%
species um there are other animals that
 
04:24:09.510 --> 04:24:09.520 align:start position:0%
are much more compatible with our
 
04:24:12.550 --> 04:24:12.560 align:start position:0%
natural environment such as Hogs and
 
04:24:14.229 --> 04:24:14.239 align:start position:0%
while they are a small problem in New
 
04:24:15.790 --> 04:24:15.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh they're not that big of a
 
04:24:17.550 --> 04:24:17.560 align:start position:0%
problem because we have very responsible
 
04:24:20.950 --> 04:24:20.960 align:start position:0%
farmers who take care of um escaped pigs
 
04:24:23.109 --> 04:24:23.119 align:start position:0%
uh there is very little chance that
 
04:24:24.710 --> 04:24:24.720 align:start position:0%
kangaroos would be able to survive in
 
04:24:25.990 --> 04:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
the wild in New
 
04:24:28.910 --> 04:24:28.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire represent Murray thank you
 
04:24:30.630 --> 04:24:30.640 align:start position:0%
madam chair um and thank you for taking
 
04:24:32.630 --> 04:24:32.640 align:start position:0%
my question I think that gets um to a
 
04:24:34.229 --> 04:24:34.239 align:start position:0%
question that I was actually wondering
 
04:24:37.830 --> 04:24:37.840 align:start position:0%
about is whether or not
 
04:24:41.149 --> 04:24:41.159 align:start position:0%
um outdoor or indoor environments I
 
04:24:43.149 --> 04:24:43.159 align:start position:0%
guess would have to be EST lished to
 
04:24:46.550 --> 04:24:46.560 align:start position:0%
make sure that like housing or the
 
04:24:48.550 --> 04:24:48.560 align:start position:0%
farming of these animals was compatible
 
04:24:50.550 --> 04:24:50.560 align:start position:0%
with the ability to care for them it
 
04:24:52.910 --> 04:24:52.920 align:start position:0%
seems that you uh I
 
04:24:54.830 --> 04:24:54.840 align:start position:0%
guess the potential was that you
 
04:24:58.389 --> 04:24:58.399 align:start position:0%
indicated that outdoor life for exact
 
04:25:00.109 --> 04:25:00.119 align:start position:0%
kangaroo might not necessarily be
 
04:25:02.109 --> 04:25:02.119 align:start position:0%
compatible so have you given any thought
 
04:25:04.630 --> 04:25:04.640 align:start position:0%
to that so there are certain animals
 
04:25:06.870 --> 04:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
that there's questions of how long it
 
04:25:09.269 --> 04:25:09.279 align:start position:0%
takes before uh you can Slaughter the
 
04:25:12.950 --> 04:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
animal um so for instance um it takes
 
04:25:15.510 --> 04:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
about it takes a fairly long time for a
 
04:25:18.149 --> 04:25:18.159 align:start position:0%
beefer to be something that you can
 
04:25:20.349 --> 04:25:20.359 align:start position:0%
process uh kangaroos my understanding is
 
04:25:22.830 --> 04:25:22.840 align:start position:0%
it's a lot shorter and uh therefore you
 
04:25:25.389 --> 04:25:25.399 align:start position:0%
don't have to have them outside or in a
 
04:25:27.429 --> 04:25:27.439 align:start position:0%
barn in the winter um they are capable
 
04:25:30.109 --> 04:25:30.119 align:start position:0%
of handling cold to a certain degree um
 
04:25:32.389 --> 04:25:32.399 align:start position:0%
but uh they ideally you would get it
 
04:25:35.590 --> 04:25:35.600 align:start position:0%
done before that so you don't have to uh
 
04:25:37.070 --> 04:25:37.080 align:start position:0%
have the kangaroo in the in the winter
 
04:25:38.950 --> 04:25:38.960 align:start position:0%
time and you know ultimately they are
 
04:25:42.830 --> 04:25:42.840 align:start position:0%
they are livestock they are not pets so
 
04:25:47.269 --> 04:25:47.279 align:start position:0%
represent Bixby yeah so uh for um for
 
04:25:51.550 --> 04:25:51.560 align:start position:0%
deer and Elk uh the fish and game rules
 
04:25:56.070 --> 04:25:56.080 align:start position:0%
have specific enclosure requirements and
 
04:25:58.309 --> 04:25:58.319 align:start position:0%
uh I don't see anything in the bill
 
04:26:02.389 --> 04:26:02.399 align:start position:0%
about uh updating fish and game rules to
 
04:26:06.189 --> 04:26:06.199 align:start position:0%
uh to make the uh the enclosure
 
04:26:08.990 --> 04:26:09.000 align:start position:0%
requirements appropriate for kangaroos
 
04:26:11.950 --> 04:26:11.960 align:start position:0%
um I did a little bit of online research
 
04:26:14.229 --> 04:26:14.239 align:start position:0%
there's is a kangaroo Farm in British
 
04:26:17.189 --> 04:26:17.199 align:start position:0%
Columbia that would which would suggest
 
04:26:19.550 --> 04:26:19.560 align:start position:0%
it's probably viable in terms of climate
 
04:26:23.630 --> 04:26:23.640 align:start position:0%
wise here uh but they did talk about an
 
04:26:26.349 --> 04:26:26.359 align:start position:0%
issue being digging so there there would
 
04:26:27.990 --> 04:26:28.000 align:start position:0%
be need to be different rules than what
 
04:26:30.229 --> 04:26:30.239 align:start position:0%
we have now is that something that uh
 
04:26:32.269 --> 04:26:32.279 align:start position:0%
you gave any thought to so I I looked
 
04:26:33.710 --> 04:26:33.720 align:start position:0%
into the fishing game rules uh
 
04:26:37.189 --> 04:26:37.199 align:start position:0%
specifically about uh permitting and uh
 
04:26:39.149 --> 04:26:39.159 align:start position:0%
nothing in this bill as it is right now
 
04:26:41.149 --> 04:26:41.159 align:start position:0%
addresses the permitting aspect of it um
 
04:26:43.149 --> 04:26:43.159 align:start position:0%
I imagine if we have as livestock then
 
04:26:45.349 --> 04:26:45.359 align:start position:0%
fishing game would need to go ahead and
 
04:26:47.189 --> 04:26:47.199 align:start position:0%
update their rules in regards to in
 
04:26:49.389 --> 04:26:49.399 align:start position:0%
regards to that I believe fishing game
 
04:26:50.950 --> 04:26:50.960 align:start position:0%
does have the authority to update their
 
04:26:54.590 --> 04:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
rules um to reflect updates in the
 
04:26:57.790 --> 04:26:57.800 align:start position:0%
rsas um if if there if something needs
 
04:26:59.670 --> 04:26:59.680 align:start position:0%
to be addressed specifically within this
 
04:27:02.469 --> 04:27:02.479 align:start position:0%
bill um I I think an amendment uh would
 
04:27:04.309 --> 04:27:04.319 align:start position:0%
be in order I tried to make sure that we
 
04:27:06.790 --> 04:27:06.800 align:start position:0%
dotted our te's and crossed our eyes but
 
04:27:08.910 --> 04:27:08.920 align:start position:0%
um I when it comes to actually
 
04:27:11.309 --> 04:27:11.319 align:start position:0%
containing the animal um if you're
 
04:27:13.830 --> 04:27:13.840 align:start position:0%
importing an animal from Australia um
 
04:27:16.590 --> 04:27:16.600 align:start position:0%
you don't want it to you you you don't
 
04:27:18.189 --> 04:27:18.199 align:start position:0%
want it to get out so it would be in the
 
04:27:20.750 --> 04:27:20.760 align:start position:0%
farmer's interest to make sure just on
 
04:27:22.349 --> 04:27:22.359 align:start position:0%
their own even without any rules to make
 
04:27:24.670 --> 04:27:24.680 align:start position:0%
sure that the animal doesn't
 
04:27:27.269 --> 04:27:27.279 align:start position:0%
escape uh I have a question and then you
 
04:27:30.149 --> 04:27:30.159 align:start position:0%
so in your bill on page
 
04:27:33.429 --> 04:27:33.439 align:start position:0%
two um line
 
04:27:36.469 --> 04:27:36.479 align:start position:0%
32 um so a copy of s report show a
 
04:27:38.469 --> 04:27:38.479 align:start position:0%
company that bike Elson Red Deer
 
04:27:40.469 --> 04:27:40.479 align:start position:0%
kangaroo Caribou carcass to the
 
04:27:42.469 --> 04:27:42.479 align:start position:0%
processing facility do you know if there
 
04:27:44.070 --> 04:27:44.080 align:start position:0%
are any processing facilities that
 
04:27:48.030 --> 04:27:48.040 align:start position:0%
process kangaroo um I do not uh I I uh
 
04:27:50.630 --> 04:27:50.640 align:start position:0%
we just tried to put the the kangaroo
 
04:27:55.269 --> 04:27:55.279 align:start position:0%
and the Caribou in existing rsas um if
 
04:27:57.710 --> 04:27:57.720 align:start position:0%
uh does the I I'm not entirely sure
 
04:28:01.030 --> 04:28:01.040 align:start position:0%
maybe that would be a a question for uh
 
04:28:02.550 --> 04:28:02.560 align:start position:0%
the I forget his
 
04:28:06.750 --> 04:28:06.760 align:start position:0%
name Mr Jasper okay but um I'm not 100%
 
04:28:09.309 --> 04:28:09.319 align:start position:0%
on that no representative Bixby did you
 
04:28:11.109 --> 04:28:11.119 align:start position:0%
have a question oh you had a question uh
 
04:28:12.630 --> 04:28:12.640 align:start position:0%
representative Murray I'm sorry s you
 
04:28:15.790 --> 04:28:15.800 align:start position:0%
got thank you um I had a a two-part
 
04:28:17.469 --> 04:28:17.479 align:start position:0%
question my first was with regard to
 
04:28:22.149 --> 04:28:22.159 align:start position:0%
marsupi like kangaroos I are there has
 
04:28:23.790 --> 04:28:23.800 align:start position:0%
our state veterinarian waigh in on
 
04:28:26.510 --> 04:28:26.520 align:start position:0%
zoonotic disease transfer or any
 
04:28:30.229 --> 04:28:30.239 align:start position:0%
concerns around um those issues
 
04:28:33.990 --> 04:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
for uh with regard to Kangaroo so we did
 
04:28:36.950 --> 04:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
look into diseases that kangaroos carry
 
04:28:39.269 --> 04:28:39.279 align:start position:0%
and if you'll notice
 
04:28:44.469 --> 04:28:44.479 align:start position:0%
on at the second okay it's on
 
04:28:47.510 --> 04:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
page it's on the third uh page uh line
 
04:28:50.950 --> 04:28:50.960 align:start position:0%
eight uh we didn't include Caribou in uh
 
04:28:54.269 --> 04:28:54.279 align:start position:0%
in sec in area in in K uh or we didn't
 
04:28:56.109 --> 04:28:56.119 align:start position:0%
include kangaroo because they do not get
 
04:28:58.670 --> 04:28:58.680 align:start position:0%
chronic wasting disease um there there
 
04:29:00.189 --> 04:29:00.199 align:start position:0%
may be diseases that they get but I'm
 
04:29:02.950 --> 04:29:02.960 align:start position:0%
not aware of them uh that may be I'm I'm
 
04:29:04.189 --> 04:29:04.199 align:start position:0%
not aware of them and I couldn't find
 
04:29:07.070 --> 04:29:07.080 align:start position:0%
them when I looked looked it
 
04:29:10.550 --> 04:29:10.560 align:start position:0%
up represent Penza
 
04:29:13.550 --> 04:29:13.560 align:start position:0%
okay she have a follow I did go ahead oh
 
04:29:15.189 --> 04:29:15.199 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry go ahead follow up hey and I
 
04:29:17.590 --> 04:29:17.600 align:start position:0%
was just going to say with regard to Ser
 
04:29:21.469 --> 04:29:21.479 align:start position:0%
uh so there most of what is referred to
 
04:29:24.349 --> 04:29:24.359 align:start position:0%
in this bill is Serv a species um prior
 
04:29:27.070 --> 04:29:27.080 align:start position:0%
to your Amendment so the addition of a
 
04:29:30.149 --> 04:29:30.159 align:start position:0%
marsupial into this um that was my other
 
04:29:32.469 --> 04:29:32.479 align:start position:0%
question and it seems that you had kind
 
04:29:34.830 --> 04:29:34.840 align:start position:0%
of answered parts of that
 
04:29:38.870 --> 04:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:42.670 --> 04:29:42.680 align:start position:0%
Penza so I guess my question is um in
 
04:29:44.389 --> 04:29:44.399 align:start position:0%
regards with the bill it's it's
 
04:29:47.630 --> 04:29:47.640 align:start position:0%
basically adding in these two um these
 
04:29:50.990 --> 04:29:51.000 align:start position:0%
two animals to in this process and then
 
04:29:54.149 --> 04:29:54.159 align:start position:0%
fishing game would uh put in rules or
 
04:29:55.790 --> 04:29:55.800 align:start position:0%
whatever for all restrictions and
 
04:29:57.309 --> 04:29:57.319 align:start position:0%
perating do you believe that we could
 
04:30:00.070 --> 04:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
look at another state that's doing this
 
04:30:03.149 --> 04:30:03.159 align:start position:0%
you said Wisconsin for example and um or
 
04:30:05.189 --> 04:30:05.199 align:start position:0%
would you provide that information
 
04:30:07.550 --> 04:30:07.560 align:start position:0%
possibly to the committee so they can
 
04:30:09.469 --> 04:30:09.479 align:start position:0%
kind of see what is happening there
 
04:30:11.389 --> 04:30:11.399 align:start position:0%
another state that is you know currently
 
04:30:13.590 --> 04:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
doing this have as an operation it's
 
04:30:15.870 --> 04:30:15.880 align:start position:0%
working for them would you be willing to
 
04:30:18.229 --> 04:30:18.239 align:start position:0%
do that if if you want I can uh I can I
 
04:30:19.910 --> 04:30:19.920 align:start position:0%
think OS can do a better job at that
 
04:30:21.990 --> 04:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
than I can I I did as you know research
 
04:30:23.429 --> 04:30:23.439 align:start position:0%
for this bill just sort to check in
 
04:30:26.389 --> 04:30:26.399 align:start position:0%
Wisconsin specifically but OS they're
 
04:30:27.870 --> 04:30:27.880 align:start position:0%
probably more efficient at because you
 
04:30:29.429 --> 04:30:29.439 align:start position:0%
know every state has their own way of
 
04:30:30.790 --> 04:30:30.800 align:start position:0%
keeping track of the rules and all that
 
04:30:32.830 --> 04:30:32.840 align:start position:0%
I I could I could do that and I'll give
 
04:30:34.149 --> 04:30:34.159 align:start position:0%
you a copy I'll write down to do that
 
04:30:34.159 --> 04:30:35.469 align:start position:0%
you a copy I'll write down to do that
okay

04:30:35.469 --> 04:30:35.479 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:30:40.030 --> 04:30:40.040 align:start position:0%
okay okay represent Bixby so um I'm I'm
 
04:30:42.309 --> 04:30:42.319 align:start position:0%
glad that you included Caribou in terms
 
04:30:45.349 --> 04:30:45.359 align:start position:0%
of the the testing for uh chronic
 
04:30:48.870 --> 04:30:48.880 align:start position:0%
wasting disease uh but um I did a little
 
04:30:53.590 --> 04:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
bit of research about uh Caribou in uh
 
04:30:55.189 --> 04:30:55.199 align:start position:0%
well it was it was actually in Maine
 
04:30:57.469 --> 04:30:57.479 align:start position:0%
they tried to reestablish Caribou in
 
04:30:58.870 --> 04:30:58.880 align:start position:0%
Maine back in the
 
04:31:02.790 --> 04:31:02.800 align:start position:0%
1980s uh importing animals from Newfound
 
04:31:06.429 --> 04:31:06.439 align:start position:0%
land and one of the pro and the animals
 
04:31:06.439 --> 04:31:07.750 align:start position:0%
land and one of the pro and the animals
they

04:31:07.750 --> 04:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
they
 
04:31:11.389 --> 04:31:11.399 align:start position:0%
reimported uh all died within about a
 
04:31:13.670 --> 04:31:13.680 align:start position:0%
year of the time that they imported them
 
04:31:16.309 --> 04:31:16.319 align:start position:0%
because there were diseases in the
 
04:31:20.550 --> 04:31:20.560 align:start position:0%
native herds that were um basically the
 
04:31:22.469 --> 04:31:22.479 align:start position:0%
the Caribou were not able to deal with
 
04:31:25.030 --> 04:31:25.040 align:start position:0%
like like Rin worms and I'm wondering if
 
04:31:27.950 --> 04:31:27.960 align:start position:0%
you see that as a potential in
 
04:31:30.469 --> 04:31:30.479 align:start position:0%
impediment to this working here in New
 
04:31:32.670 --> 04:31:32.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so I spoke to people who are
 
04:31:36.590 --> 04:31:36.600 align:start position:0%
interested in raising caribou and in the
 
04:31:39.269 --> 04:31:39.279 align:start position:0%
North Country I I believe that Santa's
 
04:31:42.590 --> 04:31:42.600 align:start position:0%
Village has caribou and
 
04:31:45.309 --> 04:31:45.319 align:start position:0%
they uh the problem they're experiencing
 
04:31:48.670 --> 04:31:48.680 align:start position:0%
is they can't import new caribou and so
 
04:31:51.229 --> 04:31:51.239 align:start position:0%
that leads to genetic issues um but the
 
04:31:52.710 --> 04:31:52.720 align:start position:0%
reason that they have them and almost
 
04:31:55.189 --> 04:31:55.199 align:start position:0%
nobody else does is because they were
 
04:31:57.109 --> 04:31:57.119 align:start position:0%
grandfathered in before the current
 
04:31:59.830 --> 04:31:59.840 align:start position:0%
rules were in place and so that means
 
04:32:02.590 --> 04:32:02.600 align:start position:0%
that there's an issue for them and for
 
04:32:04.229 --> 04:32:04.239 align:start position:0%
other people who want to raise
 
04:32:07.830 --> 04:32:07.840 align:start position:0%
Caribou uh getting getting the genetic
 
04:32:11.469 --> 04:32:11.479 align:start position:0%
stock into a a breeding population is is
 
04:32:13.309 --> 04:32:13.319 align:start position:0%
difficult but that does prove that they
 
04:32:15.510 --> 04:32:15.520 align:start position:0%
are uh viable in a farm environment in
 
04:32:15.520 --> 04:32:16.389 align:start position:0%
are uh viable in a farm environment in
New

04:32:16.389 --> 04:32:16.399 align:start position:0%
New
 
04:32:19.710 --> 04:32:19.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire represent so so that actually
 
04:32:22.109 --> 04:32:22.119 align:start position:0%
brings up another question which is
 
04:32:24.590 --> 04:32:24.600 align:start position:0%
actually the sourcing because at this
 
04:32:24.600 --> 04:32:25.870 align:start position:0%
actually the sourcing because at this
point

04:32:25.870 --> 04:32:25.880 align:start position:0%
point
 
04:32:31.469 --> 04:32:31.479 align:start position:0%
um any the the rules have servid day all
 
04:32:34.030 --> 04:32:34.040 align:start position:0%
Ser day that would be farmed are need to
 
04:32:38.030 --> 04:32:38.040 align:start position:0%
be closed herds uh because uh the
 
04:32:40.830 --> 04:32:40.840 align:start position:0%
chronic wasting disease is considered a
 
04:32:44.710 --> 04:32:44.720 align:start position:0%
danger to uh for importing other animals
 
04:32:46.510 --> 04:32:46.520 align:start position:0%
even if they've been certified they've
 
04:32:49.309 --> 04:32:49.319 align:start position:0%
been uh so deer farms and Elk farms in
 
04:32:51.830 --> 04:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
other states have ended up getting
 
04:32:54.590 --> 04:32:54.600 align:start position:0%
chronic wasting disease because of
 
04:32:58.550 --> 04:32:58.560 align:start position:0%
animals they've imported uh so do you
 
04:33:02.189 --> 04:33:02.199 align:start position:0%
are you looking to um somehow change the
 
04:33:06.230 --> 04:33:06.240 align:start position:0%
or relax the restrictions on
 
04:33:08.789 --> 04:33:08.799 align:start position:0%
importing I'm mostly just trying to add
 
04:33:11.990 --> 04:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
so it I I believe that you are current
 
04:33:17.470 --> 04:33:17.480 align:start position:0%
able to import Red Deer and red
 
04:33:19.789 --> 04:33:19.799 align:start position:0%
oh okay we we had a study committee on
 
04:33:26.310 --> 04:33:26.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:29.269 --> 04:33:29.279 align:start position:0%
okay well so the the current RSA not the
 
04:33:32.029 --> 04:33:32.039 align:start position:0%
part that I Chang mentions Red Deer and
 
04:33:34.269 --> 04:33:34.279 align:start position:0%
how how to handle them and make sure
 
04:33:35.349 --> 04:33:35.359 align:start position:0%
that they don't have chronic wasting
 
04:33:37.750 --> 04:33:37.760 align:start position:0%
disease so I if it's in the RSA I mean I
 
04:33:39.869 --> 04:33:39.879 align:start position:0%
could be wrong about this but I assume
 
04:33:41.310 --> 04:33:41.320 align:start position:0%
that if it's in the RSA and it says that
 
04:33:43.709 --> 04:33:43.719 align:start position:0%
this is how handle a red deer um if
 
04:33:46.590 --> 04:33:46.600 align:start position:0%
you're farming Red Deer then you would
 
04:33:48.390 --> 04:33:48.400 align:start position:0%
be able to get a red deer right so the
 
04:33:50.670 --> 04:33:50.680 align:start position:0%
fishing game rules actually have it
 
04:33:53.869 --> 04:33:53.879 align:start position:0%
restricted to being a closed herd with
 
04:33:57.189 --> 04:33:57.199 align:start position:0%
both Red Deer and Elk okay um so in in
 
04:33:59.789 --> 04:33:59.799 align:start position:0%
in that case um I know that fishing game
 
04:34:01.551 --> 04:34:01.561 align:start position:0%
has a separate list they have a they
 
04:34:03.910 --> 04:34:03.920 align:start position:0%
have a they have a license of animals
 
04:34:05.910 --> 04:34:05.920 align:start position:0%
you are allowed to or animals you must
 
04:34:07.990 --> 04:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
have a license to possess and I believe
 
04:34:10.310 --> 04:34:10.320 align:start position:0%
that the uh one complaint that people
 
04:34:11.990 --> 04:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
have with that is that it's they don't
 
04:34:14.551 --> 04:34:14.561 align:start position:0%
issue licenses for certain animals and I
 
04:34:18.629 --> 04:34:18.639 align:start position:0%
believe they also have a list of f FIS
 
04:34:22.269 --> 04:34:22.279 align:start position:0%
803 and FIS 804 of ones you need a
 
04:34:26.510 --> 04:34:26.520 align:start position:0%
license to import and um is it so if you
 
04:34:28.590 --> 04:34:28.600 align:start position:0%
don't mind me asking questions of the
 
04:34:32.949 --> 04:34:32.959 align:start position:0%
committee um well I don't know go go for
 
04:34:35.189 --> 04:34:35.199 align:start position:0%
it okay um
 
04:34:38.750 --> 04:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
so is is is the difficulty in that the
 
04:34:41.390 --> 04:34:41.400 align:start position:0%
fishing game won't issue the licenses
 
04:34:44.230 --> 04:34:44.240 align:start position:0%
for for importing of Red Deer even
 
04:34:46.109 --> 04:34:46.119 align:start position:0%
though it isn't technically illegal per
 
04:34:46.119 --> 04:34:47.910 align:start position:0%
though it isn't technically illegal per
the

04:34:47.910 --> 04:34:47.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:34:52.429 --> 04:34:52.439 align:start position:0%
rsas represent big so uh fishing game is
 
04:34:56.949 --> 04:34:56.959 align:start position:0%
authorized by the rsas to uh make
 
04:34:59.709 --> 04:34:59.719 align:start position:0%
restrictions that are appropriate
 
04:35:04.189 --> 04:35:04.199 align:start position:0%
for uh any disease issues that they
 
04:35:08.230 --> 04:35:08.240 align:start position:0%
identify with any stock of animals so um
 
04:35:10.510 --> 04:35:10.520 align:start position:0%
so they are they are authorized by the
 
04:35:14.029 --> 04:35:14.039 align:start position:0%
rsas to say no you can't import Red Deer
 
04:35:17.310 --> 04:35:17.320 align:start position:0%
no you can't import elk be and the basis
 
04:35:20.789 --> 04:35:20.799 align:start position:0%
for that is that uh is the chronic
 
04:35:23.709 --> 04:35:23.719 align:start position:0%
wasting disease and New Hampshire is
 
04:35:25.869 --> 04:35:25.879 align:start position:0%
currently free of
 
04:35:30.310 --> 04:35:30.320 align:start position:0%
CWD but uh other states not too far from
 
04:35:35.510 --> 04:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
us have had uh CWD enter through farmed
 
04:35:37.349 --> 04:35:37.359 align:start position:0%
animals like New York had an issue with
 
04:35:40.230 --> 04:35:40.240 align:start position:0%
that uh and they want to make sure that
 
04:35:42.390 --> 04:35:42.400 align:start position:0%
we don't get CWD into our native
 
04:35:45.750 --> 04:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
population because it's a bad for people
 
04:35:48.750 --> 04:35:48.760 align:start position:0%
and B it's very hard to get rid of and
 
04:35:52.029 --> 04:35:52.039 align:start position:0%
it's also bad for hunters so I know uh
 
04:35:54.230 --> 04:35:54.240 align:start position:0%
so one of the people that was pushing
 
04:35:58.109 --> 04:35:58.119 align:start position:0%
for this bill has a about a 400 acre set
 
04:36:00.310 --> 04:36:00.320 align:start position:0%
of land and they would like to be able
 
04:36:03.189 --> 04:36:03.199 align:start position:0%
to have caribou and uh he has done a lot
 
04:36:06.429 --> 04:36:06.439 align:start position:0%
more research into this uh than I have
 
04:36:08.750 --> 04:36:08.760 align:start position:0%
and uh he wasn't able to be here today
 
04:36:10.429 --> 04:36:10.439 align:start position:0%
um however I can get him to give written
 
04:36:12.109 --> 04:36:12.119 align:start position:0%
testimony addressing that if you
 
04:36:15.230 --> 04:36:15.240 align:start position:0%
like sure thank you any other questions
 
04:36:16.230 --> 04:36:16.240 align:start position:0%
from the
 
04:36:18.429 --> 04:36:18.439 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you
 
04:36:20.789 --> 04:36:20.799 align:start position:0%
representative Granger and I just called
 
04:36:24.390 --> 04:36:24.400 align:start position:0%
now Don um sorry Dan Burger on from New
 
04:36:36.670 --> 04:36:36.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:39.470 --> 04:36:39.480 align:start position:0%
game good afternoon I'm Dan berron I'm
 
04:36:40.869 --> 04:36:40.879 align:start position:0%
the chief of the wildlife division at
 
04:36:43.629 --> 04:36:43.639 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Fish game um I might be
 
04:36:46.109 --> 04:36:46.119 align:start position:0%
able to add some clarity to some of the
 
04:36:48.429 --> 04:36:48.439 align:start position:0%
questions that were asked um so I'm I'm
 
04:36:50.150 --> 04:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
here to testify on behalf of the
 
04:36:52.310 --> 04:36:52.320 align:start position:0%
department in opposition of this bill um
 
04:36:55.230 --> 04:36:55.240 align:start position:0%
largely due to the inclusion of caribou
 
04:36:57.709 --> 04:36:57.719 align:start position:0%
um so Caribou currently under our
 
04:37:00.349 --> 04:37:00.359 align:start position:0%
administrative rules are prohibited for
 
04:37:02.629 --> 04:37:02.639 align:start position:0%
importation um and as has been discussed
 
04:37:04.789 --> 04:37:04.799 align:start position:0%
here the main concern is chronic wasting
 
04:37:08.990 --> 04:37:09.000 align:start position:0%
disease um how it works is as was
 
04:37:11.109 --> 04:37:11.119 align:start position:0%
referenced the the statute gives the
 
04:37:13.789 --> 04:37:13.799 align:start position:0%
department Authority um to set
 
04:37:16.310 --> 04:37:16.320 align:start position:0%
regulations on importation propagation
 
04:37:19.709 --> 04:37:19.719 align:start position:0%
possession of certain species um
 
04:37:22.551 --> 04:37:22.561 align:start position:0%
currently all servid species so members
 
04:37:24.910 --> 04:37:24.920 align:start position:0%
of the deer family are prohibited under
 
04:37:26.470 --> 04:37:26.480 align:start position:0%
our rules for importation with the
 
04:37:29.429 --> 04:37:29.439 align:start position:0%
exception of phow deer um phow deer is
 
04:37:32.109 --> 04:37:32.119 align:start position:0%
one is is essentially one of the few
 
04:37:35.830 --> 04:37:35.840 align:start position:0%
servid species that um after um you know
 
04:37:38.269 --> 04:37:38.279 align:start position:0%
years of research there's no indication
 
04:37:39.590 --> 04:37:39.600 align:start position:0%
that they're really susceptible to
 
04:37:42.109 --> 04:37:42.119 align:start position:0%
chronic wasting disease um I believe
 
04:37:45.590 --> 04:37:45.600 align:start position:0%
there was one scenario where um they
 
04:37:47.590 --> 04:37:47.600 align:start position:0%
were able to they were able to infect
 
04:37:50.869 --> 04:37:50.879 align:start position:0%
the phow deer after you know injecting
 
04:37:53.510 --> 04:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
the pron into its brain um but even in
 
04:37:55.269 --> 04:37:55.279 align:start position:0%
all those circumstances they didn't they
 
04:37:57.349 --> 04:37:57.359 align:start position:0%
didn't necessarily um contract the
 
04:37:59.670 --> 04:37:59.680 align:start position:0%
disease so that is the one species that
 
04:38:01.869 --> 04:38:01.879 align:start position:0%
appears to not be susceptible to CWD and
 
04:38:04.590 --> 04:38:04.600 align:start position:0%
is allowed for importation um the reason
 
04:38:06.949 --> 04:38:06.959 align:start position:0%
that elk and red deer are included in
 
04:38:10.670 --> 04:38:10.680 align:start position:0%
here is because prior to really prior to
 
04:38:13.750 --> 04:38:13.760 align:start position:0%
CWD becoming a big uh a big concern
 
04:38:16.150 --> 04:38:16.160 align:start position:0%
which which really took off in the early
 
04:38:18.670 --> 04:38:18.680 align:start position:0%
2000s um there were already existing
 
04:38:20.869 --> 04:38:20.879 align:start position:0%
herds in the state um so there's a
 
04:38:22.830 --> 04:38:22.840 align:start position:0%
number of facilities throughout the
 
04:38:26.109 --> 04:38:26.119 align:start position:0%
state that already propagate um Red Deer
 
04:38:28.990 --> 04:38:29.000 align:start position:0%
um elk some have fallow deer um so we
 
04:38:30.869 --> 04:38:30.879 align:start position:0%
wanted to allow those people who
 
04:38:32.990 --> 04:38:33.000 align:start position:0%
currently had those animals to retain
 
04:38:34.750 --> 04:38:34.760 align:start position:0%
possession of those animals what we
 
04:38:36.709 --> 04:38:36.719 align:start position:0%
wanted to prevent was the importation of
 
04:38:39.269 --> 04:38:39.279 align:start position:0%
new animals um because as has been
 
04:38:42.109 --> 04:38:42.119 align:start position:0%
pointed out that is a very big risk of
 
04:38:44.429 --> 04:38:44.439 align:start position:0%
introduction of chronic wasting disease
 
04:38:46.269 --> 04:38:46.279 align:start position:0%
um chronic wasting disease is a preon
 
04:38:48.670 --> 04:38:48.680 align:start position:0%
disease so it's an abnormal protein um
 
04:38:51.869 --> 04:38:51.879 align:start position:0%
it is always fatal and there is no cure
 
04:38:54.230 --> 04:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
um and it is very very expensive to
 
04:38:56.189 --> 04:38:56.199 align:start position:0%
contain the disease once it once it
 
04:38:58.551 --> 04:38:58.561 align:start position:0%
establishes itself um state wildlife
 
04:39:00.230 --> 04:39:00.240 align:start position:0%
agencies end up spending millions of
 
04:39:03.590 --> 04:39:03.600 align:start position:0%
dollars um they usually do drastic herd
 
04:39:06.029 --> 04:39:06.039 align:start position:0%
reductions um this would impact if
 
04:39:07.429 --> 04:39:07.439 align:start position:0%
chronic wasting disease were to get into
 
04:39:09.349 --> 04:39:09.359 align:start position:0%
the state um this would impact our
 
04:39:11.551 --> 04:39:11.561 align:start position:0%
native deer um as well as our MO
 
04:39:14.029 --> 04:39:14.039 align:start position:0%
population which is already um as as
 
04:39:15.670 --> 04:39:15.680 align:start position:0%
most people know facing some pretty
 
04:39:19.349 --> 04:39:19.359 align:start position:0%
serious threats through um the mortality
 
04:39:22.269 --> 04:39:22.279 align:start position:0%
based from Winter tick um so we have we
 
04:39:25.230 --> 04:39:25.240 align:start position:0%
have concerns that um again nothing in
 
04:39:27.590 --> 04:39:27.600 align:start position:0%
this bill would allow the importation um
 
04:39:29.990 --> 04:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
but what it would do is create a market
 
04:39:32.789 --> 04:39:32.799 align:start position:0%
for Caribou and we think a desire for
 
04:39:34.510 --> 04:39:34.520 align:start position:0%
people to try and force us to remove
 
04:39:36.470 --> 04:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
Caribou from that that restricted
 
04:39:39.070 --> 04:39:39.080 align:start position:0%
species list for importation and I'm
 
04:39:41.430 --> 04:39:41.440 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions
 
04:39:44.070 --> 04:39:44.080 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby so do you have any
 
04:39:45.310 --> 04:39:45.320 align:start position:0%
objection to
 
04:39:49.670 --> 04:39:49.680 align:start position:0%
kangaroos um not not I we I don't know a
 
04:39:52.350 --> 04:39:52.360 align:start position:0%
lot about kangaroos I don't not not as
 
04:39:56.350 --> 04:39:56.360 align:start position:0%
pets but as as as as livestock um our
 
04:39:58.910 --> 04:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
main concern is Caribou um it's a little
 
04:40:01.430 --> 04:40:01.440 align:start position:0%
concerning to have it added into our RSA
 
04:40:03.628 --> 04:40:03.638 align:start position:0%
to just say it's it's it would be
 
04:40:05.470 --> 04:40:05.480 align:start position:0%
allowed without a permit we'd like to
 
04:40:08.110 --> 04:40:08.120 align:start position:0%
retain because we within the within the
 
04:40:09.708 --> 04:40:09.718 align:start position:0%
administrative rules that are associated
 
04:40:12.030 --> 04:40:12.040 align:start position:0%
with this RSA we have um different
 
04:40:13.510 --> 04:40:13.520 align:start position:0%
categories of species so there's
 
04:40:15.628 --> 04:40:15.638 align:start position:0%
prohibited species controlled species
 
04:40:18.310 --> 04:40:18.320 align:start position:0%
non-controlled species um we'd like to
 
04:40:20.230 --> 04:40:20.240 align:start position:0%
be able to retain the authority to to
 
04:40:21.708 --> 04:40:21.718 align:start position:0%
put that maybe on a non-controlled
 
04:40:24.190 --> 04:40:24.200 align:start position:0%
species list in the event that a disease
 
04:40:25.910 --> 04:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
were to pop up we could easily move it
 
04:40:27.590 --> 04:40:27.600 align:start position:0%
to a you know prohibited species list
 
04:40:28.910 --> 04:40:28.920 align:start position:0%
but our main concern is certainly with
 
04:40:31.230 --> 04:40:31.240 align:start position:0%
Caribou because of chronic wasting
 
04:40:34.628 --> 04:40:34.638 align:start position:0%
disease representative Murray thank you
 
04:40:36.510 --> 04:40:36.520 align:start position:0%
madam chair um and thank you for taking
 
04:40:38.150 --> 04:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
my question have you had a chance to
 
04:40:39.990 --> 04:40:40.000 align:start position:0%
talk with the state veterinarian or even
 
04:40:41.788 --> 04:40:41.798 align:start position:0%
health and human services around around
 
04:40:44.830 --> 04:40:44.840 align:start position:0%
zoonotic diseases that Caribou uh might
 
04:40:46.350 --> 04:40:46.360 align:start position:0%
carry and
 
04:40:51.230 --> 04:40:51.240 align:start position:0%
pose uh concern or threat yeah there's
 
04:40:54.110 --> 04:40:54.120 align:start position:0%
there's and Kangaroo sorry I don't know
 
04:40:56.030 --> 04:40:56.040 align:start position:0%
if I said caribou and Kangaroo yeah Kang
 
04:40:58.830 --> 04:40:58.840 align:start position:0%
kangaroos I'm not aware of any um I I
 
04:41:02.868 --> 04:41:02.878 align:start position:0%
have um I I do speak fairly routinely
 
04:41:05.350 --> 04:41:05.360 align:start position:0%
with the State Vet um I'm not aware of
 
04:41:07.390 --> 04:41:07.400 align:start position:0%
any that kangaroos carry I'm not aware
 
04:41:09.350 --> 04:41:09.360 align:start position:0%
of any zoonotic diseases that are of
 
04:41:11.910 --> 04:41:11.920 align:start position:0%
great concern with Caribou either um the
 
04:41:14.750 --> 04:41:14.760 align:start position:0%
main concern is chronic wasting disease
 
04:41:17.470 --> 04:41:17.480 align:start position:0%
currently there's no solid evidence that
 
04:41:19.310 --> 04:41:19.320 align:start position:0%
chronic wasting disease is transmissible
 
04:41:20.590 --> 04:41:20.600 align:start position:0%
to people although there has been some
 
04:41:22.310 --> 04:41:22.320 align:start position:0%
research with primates that suggests
 
04:41:24.190 --> 04:41:24.200 align:start position:0%
that it's possible so cdc's current
 
04:41:26.510 --> 04:41:26.520 align:start position:0%
recommendation is that um people do not
 
04:41:30.510 --> 04:41:30.520 align:start position:0%
eat um known known infected um venison
 
04:41:33.190 --> 04:41:33.200 align:start position:0%
or in venison from from um cids that are
 
04:41:34.350 --> 04:41:34.360 align:start position:0%
known to be infected with chronic
 
04:41:37.708 --> 04:41:37.718 align:start position:0%
wasting disease um but as far as
 
04:41:40.550 --> 04:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
zoonotic diseases um you know I know
 
04:41:43.510 --> 04:41:43.520 align:start position:0%
white tailed deer de um you know there
 
04:41:44.788 --> 04:41:44.798 align:start position:0%
was some recent work that showed that
 
04:41:46.590 --> 04:41:46.600 align:start position:0%
white ta deer were capable of of
 
04:41:49.750 --> 04:41:49.760 align:start position:0%
Contracting Corona virus um whether or
 
04:41:51.310 --> 04:41:51.320 align:start position:0%
not that's been documented in Caribou I
 
04:41:54.030 --> 04:41:54.040 align:start position:0%
haven't seen um but again even with even
 
04:41:55.628 --> 04:41:55.638 align:start position:0%
with covid and white tail deer there's
 
04:41:58.150 --> 04:41:58.160 align:start position:0%
no indication that that's a risk to
 
04:42:01.110 --> 04:42:01.120 align:start position:0%
humans right follow up thank you um one
 
04:42:02.470 --> 04:42:02.480 align:start position:0%
of the things that I had recently read
 
04:42:04.070 --> 04:42:04.080 align:start position:0%
was from the University of Texas where
 
04:42:05.830 --> 04:42:05.840 align:start position:0%
there are some herds of kangaroo that
 
04:42:08.310 --> 04:42:08.320 align:start position:0%
they are studying and that was around
 
04:42:12.030 --> 04:42:12.040 align:start position:0%
toxoplasmosis and as a a woman who uh
 
04:42:14.830 --> 04:42:14.840 align:start position:0%
anybody who's pregnant can have the um
 
04:42:17.708 --> 04:42:17.718 align:start position:0%
exposure in cats to toxoplasmosis so a
 
04:42:19.788 --> 04:42:19.798 align:start position:0%
similar concern has been raised uh
 
04:42:22.150 --> 04:42:22.160 align:start position:0%
through the University of Texas about
 
04:42:25.590 --> 04:42:25.600 align:start position:0%
toxoplasmosis in uh study environments
 
04:42:28.350 --> 04:42:28.360 align:start position:0%
um so I I would want to be very careful
 
04:42:30.510 --> 04:42:30.520 align:start position:0%
if we're looking at herds where there's
 
04:42:32.150 --> 04:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
the potential
 
04:42:34.628 --> 04:42:34.638 align:start position:0%
to if there's susceptibility between
 
04:42:37.708 --> 04:42:37.718 align:start position:0%
cats and humans and uh the kangaroos
 
04:42:39.230 --> 04:42:39.240 align:start position:0%
themselves so I I'd like to know a
 
04:42:40.788 --> 04:42:40.798 align:start position:0%
little bit more and I don't know if you
 
04:42:42.550 --> 04:42:42.560 align:start position:0%
could procure any more information on
 
04:42:44.510 --> 04:42:44.520 align:start position:0%
that that would be helpful yeah and I I
 
04:42:46.350 --> 04:42:46.360 align:start position:0%
can certainly coordinate with the State
 
04:42:49.430 --> 04:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
Vet um he would probably be be better to
 
04:42:50.868 --> 04:42:50.878 align:start position:0%
answer some of those questions but we we
 
04:42:52.270 --> 04:42:52.280 align:start position:0%
could work together to look into some of
 
04:42:55.070 --> 04:42:55.080 align:start position:0%
that in terms of what um what zoonotic
 
04:42:58.150 --> 04:42:58.160 align:start position:0%
diseases maybe maybe um kangaroos are
 
04:43:00.670 --> 04:43:00.680 align:start position:0%
susceptible to but again our our main
 
04:43:02.708 --> 04:43:02.718 align:start position:0%
concern from a wildlife perspective and
 
04:43:04.390 --> 04:43:04.400 align:start position:0%
the Department's perspective is chronic
 
04:43:04.400 --> 04:43:05.708 align:start position:0%
the Department's perspective is chronic
wasting

04:43:05.708 --> 04:43:05.718 align:start position:0%
wasting
 
04:43:09.110 --> 04:43:09.120 align:start position:0%
disease okay any other questions
 
04:43:11.350 --> 04:43:11.360 align:start position:0%
representative Penza I just had have a
 
04:43:12.948 --> 04:43:12.958 align:start position:0%
quick question because definitely not
 
04:43:16.270 --> 04:43:16.280 align:start position:0%
educated in chronic wasting disease so
 
04:43:18.230 --> 04:43:18.240 align:start position:0%
um so if you're going to import an
 
04:43:20.830 --> 04:43:20.840 align:start position:0%
animal is is there any way for you to
 
04:43:22.868 --> 04:43:22.878 align:start position:0%
know because I understand I know the
 
04:43:25.310 --> 04:43:25.320 align:start position:0%
duration right I know there's a from
 
04:43:29.230 --> 04:43:29.240 align:start position:0%
exposure so is there any way to know
 
04:43:31.628 --> 04:43:31.638 align:start position:0%
that that animal's clean before coming
 
04:43:34.230 --> 04:43:34.240 align:start position:0%
because if there is what there is not no
 
04:43:36.310 --> 04:43:36.320 align:start position:0%
so there's currently no approved live
 
04:43:38.830 --> 04:43:38.840 align:start position:0%
animal tests for the disease so to to
 
04:43:41.628 --> 04:43:41.638 align:start position:0%
test and feel even remotely confid
 
04:43:44.550 --> 04:43:44.560 align:start position:0%
um the animal has to be has to be dead
 
04:43:48.510 --> 04:43:48.520 align:start position:0%
the um so there's you know animals can
 
04:43:51.230 --> 04:43:51.240 align:start position:0%
take up to 18 months to even exhibit
 
04:43:56.110 --> 04:43:56.120 align:start position:0%
symptoms um the um as was referenced
 
04:43:58.270 --> 04:43:58.280 align:start position:0%
before so USDA does have a herd
 
04:44:00.708 --> 04:44:00.718 align:start position:0%
certification program um that that
 
04:44:04.310 --> 04:44:04.320 align:start position:0%
certain herds um will will take part in
 
04:44:05.830 --> 04:44:05.840 align:start position:0%
U particularly if they're going to move
 
04:44:11.510 --> 04:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
interestate um the uh but you you know
 
04:44:13.990 --> 04:44:14.000 align:start position:0%
that certifies a herd as low risk for
 
04:44:16.590 --> 04:44:16.600 align:start position:0%
CWD but not no risk and there have been
 
04:44:20.350 --> 04:44:20.360 align:start position:0%
multiple herds so typically a a herd has
 
04:44:22.190 --> 04:44:22.200 align:start position:0%
to show that it has not tested any
 
04:44:24.150 --> 04:44:24.160 align:start position:0%
animals positive for CWD over the course
 
04:44:26.350 --> 04:44:26.360 align:start position:0%
of five years there's been numerous
 
04:44:28.470 --> 04:44:28.480 align:start position:0%
cases of herds that after that 5year
 
04:44:30.750 --> 04:44:30.760 align:start position:0%
period have still tested positive and
 
04:44:32.030 --> 04:44:32.040 align:start position:0%
they you know their requirements that
 
04:44:33.590 --> 04:44:33.600 align:start position:0%
they have to be getting animals from
 
04:44:36.110 --> 04:44:36.120 align:start position:0%
other CWD certified herds to retain
 
04:44:39.390 --> 04:44:39.400 align:start position:0%
their certification so um while while
 
04:44:42.430 --> 04:44:42.440 align:start position:0%
the certification program certainly has
 
04:44:45.390 --> 04:44:45.400 align:start position:0%
some benefits and reduces risk it it has
 
04:44:47.708 --> 04:44:47.718 align:start position:0%
not done a good job at removing the risk
 
04:44:49.750 --> 04:44:49.760 align:start position:0%
and there are still states that that end
 
04:44:51.670 --> 04:44:51.680 align:start position:0%
up getting their first positives through
 
04:44:53.230 --> 04:44:53.240 align:start position:0%
importing captive
 
04:44:55.070 --> 04:44:55.080 align:start position:0%
servant follow
 
04:44:59.670 --> 04:44:59.680 align:start position:0%
up so if um if you know let's say we
 
04:45:01.150 --> 04:45:01.160 align:start position:0%
opened it up for let's just say for
 
04:45:05.910 --> 04:45:05.920 align:start position:0%
Caribou for example and um it it it's a
 
04:45:09.030 --> 04:45:09.040 align:start position:0%
it's closed and it you know that happens
 
04:45:10.628 --> 04:45:10.638 align:start position:0%
even though it's you know we basically
 
04:45:12.350 --> 04:45:12.360 align:start position:0%
put in criteria that could only be
 
04:45:16.708 --> 04:45:16.718 align:start position:0%
through this certified USDA certified um
 
04:45:19.750 --> 04:45:19.760 align:start position:0%
grouping and it wipes it out that's
 
04:45:21.510 --> 04:45:21.520 align:start position:0%
really how is that going to impact
 
04:45:23.788 --> 04:45:23.798 align:start position:0%
anything else except for the person that
 
04:45:29.270 --> 04:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
is running this business so um so
 
04:45:33.270 --> 04:45:33.280 align:start position:0%
typically a lot of times the so if if
 
04:45:35.310 --> 04:45:35.320 align:start position:0%
the CWD were to come in on a captive
 
04:45:38.190 --> 04:45:38.200 align:start position:0%
animal um again because there's this
 
04:45:40.430 --> 04:45:40.440 align:start position:0%
there's this dormant period where you
 
04:45:42.750 --> 04:45:42.760 align:start position:0%
may not know that the animal's positive
 
04:45:45.788 --> 04:45:45.798 align:start position:0%
um so the animal the entire time it's in
 
04:45:48.750 --> 04:45:48.760 align:start position:0%
it's it's infected can be shedding these
 
04:45:51.948 --> 04:45:51.958 align:start position:0%
proteins or these um prons and they can
 
04:45:53.990 --> 04:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
get spread out into the environment um
 
04:45:55.628 --> 04:45:55.638 align:start position:0%
you know it could be through
 
04:45:57.788 --> 04:45:57.798 align:start position:0%
contaminated farming equipment that that
 
04:46:00.350 --> 04:46:00.360 align:start position:0%
leaves the farm or um you know fence
 
04:46:03.628 --> 04:46:03.638 align:start position:0%
line contact with with native animals um
 
04:46:07.070 --> 04:46:07.080 align:start position:0%
and the protein can actually remain
 
04:46:09.750 --> 04:46:09.760 align:start position:0%
infective in the soil for um they don't
 
04:46:11.430 --> 04:46:11.440 align:start position:0%
know exactly but there's similar
 
04:46:13.550 --> 04:46:13.560 align:start position:0%
proteins um that impact sheep and it
 
04:46:15.868 --> 04:46:15.878 align:start position:0%
causes a similar disease called Scrapy
 
04:46:18.270 --> 04:46:18.280 align:start position:0%
um those have been remained active in
 
04:46:21.590 --> 04:46:21.600 align:start position:0%
the soil for like 12 years um so the
 
04:46:24.030 --> 04:46:24.040 align:start position:0%
protein itself is almost impossible to
 
04:46:26.230 --> 04:46:26.240 align:start position:0%
deactivate um it can withstand
 
04:46:28.310 --> 04:46:28.320 align:start position:0%
temperatures that you know are over a
 
04:46:31.628 --> 04:46:31.638 align:start position:0%
thousand degrees um it it's it it's
 
04:46:34.990 --> 04:46:35.000 align:start position:0%
resistant against chemicals um it's it's
 
04:46:36.750 --> 04:46:36.760 align:start position:0%
a very scary disease and again the
 
04:46:38.670 --> 04:46:38.680 align:start position:0%
problem is there's
 
04:46:41.548 --> 04:46:41.558 align:start position:0%
been I can think of two jurisdictions
 
04:46:43.708 --> 04:46:43.718 align:start position:0%
New York being one and Quebec being the
 
04:46:46.910 --> 04:46:46.920 align:start position:0%
other um they documented the disease
 
04:46:49.788 --> 04:46:49.798 align:start position:0%
soon enough and were able to put up a
 
04:46:52.030 --> 04:46:52.040 align:start position:0%
containment Zone around those areas and
 
04:46:54.750 --> 04:46:54.760 align:start position:0%
they have yet to detect more positives
 
04:46:57.270 --> 04:46:57.280 align:start position:0%
um but Quebec spent you know millions of
 
04:46:59.110 --> 04:46:59.120 align:start position:0%
dollars in the first couple of years to
 
04:47:01.110 --> 04:47:01.120 align:start position:0%
contain that disease before it spread
 
04:47:03.708 --> 04:47:03.718 align:start position:0%
into wild animals um again because this
 
04:47:05.430 --> 04:47:05.440 align:start position:0%
protein could remain active in the soil
 
04:47:07.110 --> 04:47:07.120 align:start position:0%
there's nothing saying that 5 years from
 
04:47:09.510 --> 04:47:09.520 align:start position:0%
now they might find it in Wild deer but
 
04:47:11.830 --> 04:47:11.840 align:start position:0%
um to date they have not um New York
 
04:47:13.390 --> 04:47:13.400 align:start position:0%
similar millions of dollars in
 
04:47:15.470 --> 04:47:15.480 align:start position:0%
containment um to stop the spread of
 
04:47:17.990 --> 04:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
this disease into into wild
 
04:47:21.788 --> 04:47:21.798 align:start position:0%
animals sure do we have any information
 
04:47:24.030 --> 04:47:24.040 align:start position:0%
that's um specific on New Hampshire and
 
04:47:26.070 --> 04:47:26.080 align:start position:0%
if we do just because I'm interested and
 
04:47:27.830 --> 04:47:27.840 align:start position:0%
I think other members of the committee
 
04:47:31.190 --> 04:47:31.200 align:start position:0%
would be about you know anything um that
 
04:47:32.628 --> 04:47:32.638 align:start position:0%
happened in New Hampshire in regards
 
04:47:35.750 --> 04:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
with chronic waste yes so we do um so
 
04:47:37.590 --> 04:47:37.600 align:start position:0%
the department does annual surveillance
 
04:47:39.350 --> 04:47:39.360 align:start position:0%
for chronic wasting disease we typically
 
04:47:43.150 --> 04:47:43.160 align:start position:0%
get around 400 samples from um um Hunter
 
04:47:45.590 --> 04:47:45.600 align:start position:0%
harvested white tail deer we pull lymph
 
04:47:47.070 --> 04:47:47.080 align:start position:0%
nodes from those animals and we send
 
04:47:50.230 --> 04:47:50.240 align:start position:0%
them to a lab for testing um that gives
 
04:47:53.070 --> 04:47:53.080 align:start position:0%
us some confidence um that if we were to
 
04:47:56.470 --> 04:47:56.480 align:start position:0%
have it we may find it um we also test
 
04:47:58.230 --> 04:47:58.240 align:start position:0%
any suspect animals so if there's any
 
04:47:59.470 --> 04:47:59.480 align:start position:0%
animals that are displaying you know
 
04:48:01.070 --> 04:48:01.080 align:start position:0%
your typical symptoms of chronic wasting
 
04:48:02.510 --> 04:48:02.520 align:start position:0%
disease we'll euthanize those pull
 
04:48:04.910 --> 04:48:04.920 align:start position:0%
samples have those tested um to date
 
04:48:06.190 --> 04:48:06.200 align:start position:0%
we've been doing that testing since
 
04:48:09.430 --> 04:48:09.440 align:start position:0%
about 2002 we've yet to find a positive
 
04:48:12.070 --> 04:48:12.080 align:start position:0%
um however there are uh I I won't
 
04:48:15.230 --> 04:48:15.240 align:start position:0%
remember the state off hand um I want to
 
04:48:19.190 --> 04:48:19.200 align:start position:0%
say it was Iowa or Idaho um about four
 
04:48:20.750 --> 04:48:20.760 align:start position:0%
or five years ago when they first
 
04:48:22.470 --> 04:48:22.480 align:start position:0%
detected chronic wasting disease I don't
 
04:48:24.788 --> 04:48:24.798 align:start position:0%
believe they did annual surveillance um
 
04:48:26.910 --> 04:48:26.920 align:start position:0%
they detected the disease they ramped up
 
04:48:29.390 --> 04:48:29.400 align:start position:0%
their surveillance and it was very
 
04:48:31.150 --> 04:48:31.160 align:start position:0%
evident that that disease had been in
 
04:48:32.708 --> 04:48:32.718 align:start position:0%
that state for quite some time because
 
04:48:34.670 --> 04:48:34.680 align:start position:0%
they were finding it very far from where
 
04:48:37.190 --> 04:48:37.200 align:start position:0%
the first cases showed up um so again it
 
04:48:38.990 --> 04:48:39.000 align:start position:0%
was kind of lingering in the state
 
04:48:40.750 --> 04:48:40.760 align:start position:0%
quietly for a number of years before
 
04:48:42.270 --> 04:48:42.280 align:start position:0%
before they finally found a positive and
 
04:48:43.190 --> 04:48:43.200 align:start position:0%
then when they increased their
 
04:48:45.708 --> 04:48:45.718 align:start position:0%
surveillance they found out they had it
 
04:48:47.150 --> 04:48:47.160 align:start position:0%
far more widespread than they had
 
04:48:47.160 --> 04:48:49.788 align:start position:0%
far more widespread than they had
initially

04:48:49.788 --> 04:48:49.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:52.590 --> 04:48:52.600 align:start position:0%
thought representative Murray you madam
 
04:48:55.230 --> 04:48:55.240 align:start position:0%
faon isn't it true that chronic Wasing
 
04:48:56.430 --> 04:48:56.440 align:start position:0%
disease is
 
04:48:58.910 --> 04:48:58.920 align:start position:0%
neurodegenerative it is
 
04:49:02.230 --> 04:49:02.240 align:start position:0%
yeah okay any other
 
04:49:05.390 --> 04:49:05.400 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Mr burun thank you
 
04:49:07.110 --> 04:49:07.120 align:start position:0%
really appreciate your
 
04:49:10.310 --> 04:49:10.320 align:start position:0%
testimony Joan O'Brien Nation uh New
 
04:49:37.350 --> 04:49:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:39.628 --> 04:49:39.638 align:start position:0%
League good
 
04:49:43.070 --> 04:49:43.080 align:start position:0%
afternoon good afternoon so um on behalf
 
04:49:44.948 --> 04:49:44.958 align:start position:0%
of the nental rights
 
04:49:47.910 --> 04:49:47.920 align:start position:0%
League I would um respectfully request
 
04:49:49.948 --> 04:49:49.958 align:start position:0%
that the committee oppose House Bill
 
04:49:53.310 --> 04:49:53.320 align:start position:0%
1703 to allow the raising butchering and
 
04:49:55.430 --> 04:49:55.440 align:start position:0%
sale of kangaroo Caribou meet in New
 
04:49:57.230 --> 04:49:57.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire big
 
04:50:00.190 --> 04:50:00.200 align:start position:0%
surprise um our concerns center around
 
04:50:02.788 --> 04:50:02.798 align:start position:0%
Animal Welfare but I also want to
 
04:50:04.948 --> 04:50:04.958 align:start position:0%
comment on something that didn't come up
 
04:50:07.270 --> 04:50:07.280 align:start position:0%
when the sponsor introduced the bill but
 
04:50:09.350 --> 04:50:09.360 align:start position:0%
that came up in the Press around the
 
04:50:11.910 --> 04:50:11.920 align:start position:0%
bill I think some people from the Free
 
04:50:13.868 --> 04:50:13.878 align:start position:0%
State Food Network were interviewed and
 
04:50:16.868 --> 04:50:16.878 align:start position:0%
I read some things and what they were
 
04:50:18.310 --> 04:50:18.320 align:start position:0%
saying was that this would be a more
 
04:50:21.948 --> 04:50:21.958 align:start position:0%
sustainable way to farm animals and that
 
04:50:24.190 --> 04:50:24.200 align:start position:0%
that's why they were bringing forth this
 
04:50:25.350 --> 04:50:25.360 align:start position:0%
idea of
 
04:50:28.190 --> 04:50:28.200 align:start position:0%
kangaroos who basically produce no
 
04:50:30.830 --> 04:50:30.840 align:start position:0%
methane as compared to a cow and I guess
 
04:50:32.350 --> 04:50:32.360 align:start position:0%
Caribou are more sustainable because
 
04:50:35.230 --> 04:50:35.240 align:start position:0%
they eat very little so I was expecting
 
04:50:36.670 --> 04:50:36.680 align:start position:0%
some discussion around that since I had
 
04:50:37.990 --> 04:50:38.000 align:start position:0%
read that in the paper and I am going to
 
04:50:40.628 --> 04:50:40.638 align:start position:0%
comment on that but first the welfare
 
04:50:43.708 --> 04:50:43.718 align:start position:0%
concerns um the challenges of kangaroo
 
04:50:47.110 --> 04:50:47.120 align:start position:0%
farming aside um not having been
 
04:50:47.120 --> 04:50:49.190 align:start position:0%
farming aside um not having been
domesticated

04:50:49.190 --> 04:50:49.200 align:start position:0%
domesticated
 
04:50:52.030 --> 04:50:52.040 align:start position:0%
yet Kangaroos and to a lesser extent
 
04:50:54.190 --> 04:50:54.200 align:start position:0%
Caribou have the potential to suffer
 
04:50:56.948 --> 04:50:56.958 align:start position:0%
from the confines and husbandry
 
04:50:59.548 --> 04:50:59.558 align:start position:0%
practices of farm life even more than
 
04:51:02.430 --> 04:51:02.440 align:start position:0%
domesticated farmed animals do for the
 
04:51:04.708 --> 04:51:04.718 align:start position:0%
following reasons kangaroos are
 
04:51:07.110 --> 04:51:07.120 align:start position:0%
accustomed to traveling many miles a day
 
04:51:09.548 --> 04:51:09.558 align:start position:0%
and are known to die of stress when
 
04:51:09.558 --> 04:51:11.230 align:start position:0%
and are known to die of stress when
confined

04:51:11.230 --> 04:51:11.240 align:start position:0%
confined
 
04:51:12.788 --> 04:51:12.798 align:start position:0%
uh climate wise Caribou could
 
04:51:14.430 --> 04:51:14.440 align:start position:0%
conceivably do better in New Hampshire
 
04:51:16.708 --> 04:51:16.718 align:start position:0%
than kangaroos however given that these
 
04:51:18.670 --> 04:51:18.680 align:start position:0%
animals are known for having the longest
 
04:51:21.868 --> 04:51:21.878 align:start position:0%
land migration on the planet they walk
 
04:51:24.670 --> 04:51:24.680 align:start position:0%
2,000 miles a year um between their
 
04:51:27.190 --> 04:51:27.200 align:start position:0%
winter and summer grounds confining them
 
04:51:29.750 --> 04:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
would be unnatural at
 
04:51:34.430 --> 04:51:34.440 align:start position:0%
best so regarding the uh Freestate food
 
04:51:37.470 --> 04:51:37.480 align:start position:0%
networks press around this being a more
 
04:51:39.548 --> 04:51:39.558 align:start position:0%
sustainable way to raise animals for
 
04:51:39.558 --> 04:51:42.708 align:start position:0%
sustainable way to raise animals for
food

04:51:42.708 --> 04:51:42.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:44.708 --> 04:51:44.718 align:start position:0%
I really appreciate that that came up in
 
04:51:46.990 --> 04:51:47.000 align:start position:0%
the Press because it shows that people
 
04:51:49.470 --> 04:51:49.480 align:start position:0%
recognize that animal agriculture is a
 
04:51:52.310 --> 04:51:52.320 align:start position:0%
major source of carbon emissions and
 
04:51:52.320 --> 04:51:54.750 align:start position:0%
major source of carbon emissions and
climate

04:51:54.750 --> 04:51:54.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:57.110 --> 04:51:57.120 align:start position:0%
change which is a topic that was
 
04:51:59.470 --> 04:51:59.480 align:start position:0%
addressed in a recent talk by Dr Allison
 
04:52:02.070 --> 04:52:02.080 align:start position:0%
leech of the UNH sustainability
 
04:52:04.590 --> 04:52:04.600 align:start position:0%
Institute and I've got some some
 
04:52:07.270 --> 04:52:07.280 align:start position:0%
information about that on the back but
 
04:52:09.150 --> 04:52:09.160 align:start position:0%
this bill only allows for Kangaroo
 
04:52:11.030 --> 04:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
farming on a small scale
 
04:52:12.788 --> 04:52:12.798 align:start position:0%
in the same way that deer bison and so
 
04:52:14.510 --> 04:52:14.520 align:start position:0%
are farmed in New Hampshire to serve a
 
04:52:17.150 --> 04:52:17.160 align:start position:0%
niche market it's unrealistic to expect
 
04:52:18.430 --> 04:52:18.440 align:start position:0%
that allowing kangaroo and Caribou
 
04:52:19.750 --> 04:52:19.760 align:start position:0%
farming in New Hampshire would have a
 
04:52:22.030 --> 04:52:22.040 align:start position:0%
significant impact on
 
04:52:24.990 --> 04:52:25.000 align:start position:0%
climate swapping cows for kangaroos on a
 
04:52:27.390 --> 04:52:27.400 align:start position:0%
scale large enough to mitigate climate
 
04:52:30.430 --> 04:52:30.440 align:start position:0%
change would require a complete remodel
 
04:52:33.310 --> 04:52:33.320 align:start position:0%
of the current beef industry from which
 
04:52:35.788 --> 04:52:35.798 align:start position:0%
crops we grow to feed our animals all
 
04:52:38.190 --> 04:52:38.200 align:start position:0%
the way to the design of slaughter
 
04:52:40.830 --> 04:52:40.840 align:start position:0%
houses rather than adding two new
 
04:52:43.190 --> 04:52:43.200 align:start position:0%
animals to the menu the the Free State
 
04:52:46.150 --> 04:52:46.160 align:start position:0%
Food Network and others wishing to
 
04:52:47.868 --> 04:52:47.878 align:start position:0%
reduce carbon emissions could simply eat
 
04:52:51.708 --> 04:52:51.718 align:start position:0%
less meat or none at all thank
 
04:52:54.948 --> 04:52:54.958 align:start position:0%
you okay any questions from the
 
04:52:57.310 --> 04:52:57.320 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you so much
 
04:52:58.708 --> 04:52:58.718 align:start position:0%
for your
 
04:53:01.708 --> 04:53:01.718 align:start position:0%
testimony and I now call um commissioner
 
04:53:09.430 --> 04:53:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:09.440 --> 04:53:19.628 align:start position:0%
 
Agriculture

04:53:19.628 --> 04:53:19.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:21.350 --> 04:53:21.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Madame chairman members of the
 
04:53:23.070 --> 04:53:23.080 align:start position:0%
committee and I am borrowing your
 
04:53:25.788 --> 04:53:25.798 align:start position:0%
statutes here I didn't have enough time
 
04:53:31.830 --> 04:53:31.840 align:start position:0%
to to do my homework on this um so I am
 
04:53:34.548 --> 04:53:34.558 align:start position:0%
concerned um and you know I would
 
04:53:36.628 --> 04:53:36.638 align:start position:0%
suggest to you I I asked to go last
 
04:53:38.310 --> 04:53:38.320 align:start position:0%
because I was waiting to hear from the
 
04:53:42.350 --> 04:53:42.360 align:start position:0%
kangaroo and bison or Caribou Farmers um
 
04:53:43.910 --> 04:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
and I'm always concerned when we just
 
04:53:46.150 --> 04:53:46.160 align:start position:0%
add things in and there's actually
 
04:53:49.390 --> 04:53:49.400 align:start position:0%
nobody who is is here we did hear about
 
04:53:51.628 --> 04:53:51.638 align:start position:0%
somebody who would like to do caribou
 
04:53:53.110 --> 04:53:53.120 align:start position:0%
but we don't have any in the state and
 
04:53:55.548 --> 04:53:55.558 align:start position:0%
they're not going to be allowed to be
 
04:53:58.230 --> 04:53:58.240 align:start position:0%
imported um and I don't think I heard
 
04:54:01.470 --> 04:54:01.480 align:start position:0%
anything about kangaroo Farmers so why
 
04:54:04.030 --> 04:54:04.040 align:start position:0%
would we be adding these things in and
 
04:54:06.510 --> 04:54:06.520 align:start position:0%
and but where my my
 
04:54:09.990 --> 04:54:10.000 align:start position:0%
statutory concern is that if you go to
 
04:54:11.708 --> 04:54:11.718 align:start position:0%
page two of the
 
04:54:16.750 --> 04:54:16.760 align:start position:0%
bill um line eight it talks about
 
04:54:20.230 --> 04:54:20.240 align:start position:0%
Slaughter on a farm so if you actually
 
04:54:24.788 --> 04:54:24.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:28.230 --> 04:54:28.240 align:start position:0%
234a the word in Roman one it talks
 
04:54:33.948 --> 04:54:33.958 align:start position:0%
about livestock you have and it so what
 
04:54:36.230 --> 04:54:36.240 align:start position:0%
does it mean to have livestock well you
 
04:54:36.240 --> 04:54:37.830 align:start position:0%
does it mean to have livestock well you
go

04:54:37.830 --> 04:54:37.840 align:start position:0%
go
 
04:54:40.830 --> 04:54:40.840 align:start position:0%
to back and forth here but
 
04:54:46.628 --> 04:54:46.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:49.390 --> 04:54:49.400 align:start position:0%
4272 this goes way
 
04:54:51.910 --> 04:54:51.920 align:start position:0%
back I don't know where it starts but
 
04:54:55.230 --> 04:54:55.240 align:start position:0%
the definition of livestock under uh 18
 
04:54:58.750 --> 04:54:58.760 align:start position:0%
section 18 of 472a shall include and
 
04:55:02.070 --> 04:55:02.080 align:start position:0%
limits all the things but when we get to
 
04:55:05.230 --> 04:55:05.240 align:start position:0%
like Buffalo it says domestic
 
04:55:09.310 --> 04:55:09.320 align:start position:0%
domesticated strains of Buffalo etc etc
 
04:55:14.390 --> 04:55:14.400 align:start position:0%
etc now we go to the bill and it is not
 
04:55:18.590 --> 04:55:18.600 align:start position:0%
including these animals in livestock but
 
04:55:21.350 --> 04:55:21.360 align:start position:0%
it's saying raised on a farm but Farm
 
04:55:23.510 --> 04:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't include these things so the bill
 
04:55:23.520 --> 04:55:24.990 align:start position:0%
doesn't include these things so the bill
has

04:55:24.990 --> 04:55:25.000 align:start position:0%
has
 
04:55:28.670 --> 04:55:28.680 align:start position:0%
statutory um problems in that you're now
 
04:55:30.868 --> 04:55:30.878 align:start position:0%
saying it's a farm but it's not part of
 
04:55:33.190 --> 04:55:33.200 align:start position:0%
farming it's not part of livestock what
 
04:55:35.750 --> 04:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
are these animals and how are they they
 
04:55:37.670 --> 04:55:37.680 align:start position:0%
controlled if you want to do this I
 
04:55:41.510 --> 04:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
think you need to to fix uh that problem
 
04:55:41.520 --> 04:55:43.030 align:start position:0%
think you need to to fix uh that problem
as

04:55:43.030 --> 04:55:43.040 align:start position:0%
as
 
04:55:46.030 --> 04:55:46.040 align:start position:0%
well um and
 
04:55:50.270 --> 04:55:50.280 align:start position:0%
also the bill itself refers back to um
 
04:55:55.910 --> 04:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
RSA 143 A5 exemptions Roman 9 a farm
 
04:55:58.030 --> 04:55:58.040 align:start position:0%
owned or operated by any person firm or
 
04:56:00.510 --> 04:56:00.520 align:start position:0%
corporation that raises bison elk or Red
 
04:56:02.788 --> 04:56:02.798 align:start position:0%
Deer for human consumption it refers to
 
04:56:05.788 --> 04:56:05.798 align:start position:0%
that section but does not now include
 
04:56:08.708 --> 04:56:08.718 align:start position:0%
kangaroos or Caribou in there so that's
 
04:56:11.270 --> 04:56:11.280 align:start position:0%
very confusing so you would need to
 
04:56:17.628 --> 04:56:17.638 align:start position:0%
adjust that section as as well um so
 
04:56:21.150 --> 04:56:21.160 align:start position:0%
those are my concerns as as commissioner
 
04:56:23.830 --> 04:56:23.840 align:start position:0%
that we're by simply adopting this bill
 
04:56:25.590 --> 04:56:25.600 align:start position:0%
as it you would be creating a a
 
04:56:28.350 --> 04:56:28.360 align:start position:0%
nightmare and I'm not sure exactly how
 
04:56:30.470 --> 04:56:30.480 align:start position:0%
we deal with this but I would certainly
 
04:56:33.548 --> 04:56:33.558 align:start position:0%
be opposed to adding these
 
04:56:36.150 --> 04:56:36.160 align:start position:0%
undomesticated animals into the
 
04:56:38.470 --> 04:56:38.480 align:start position:0%
definition of livestock to solve one
 
04:56:42.750 --> 04:56:42.760 align:start position:0%
part of the problem GL to take any
 
04:56:45.150 --> 04:56:45.160 align:start position:0%
questions okay so basically what you're
 
04:56:46.910 --> 04:56:46.920 align:start position:0%
saying is that there would be
 
04:56:50.070 --> 04:56:50.080 align:start position:0%
conflicts if this was adopted as written
 
04:56:52.150 --> 04:56:52.160 align:start position:0%
there would be conflicts within
 
04:56:55.470 --> 04:56:55.480 align:start position:0%
different parts of the rsas yes and and
 
04:56:58.150 --> 04:56:58.160 align:start position:0%
I think you know for me as the
 
04:57:00.390 --> 04:57:00.400 align:start position:0%
commissioner you know the most
 
04:57:03.990 --> 04:57:04.000 align:start position:0%
problematic part is is saying that these
 
04:57:07.230 --> 04:57:07.240 align:start position:0%
are um you can Farm them but you're not
 
04:57:08.990 --> 04:57:09.000 align:start position:0%
including them in the definition of a
 
04:57:13.590 --> 04:57:13.600 align:start position:0%
farm or livestock so you how are they
 
04:57:16.788 --> 04:57:16.798 align:start position:0%
how are they dealt with it all and
 
04:57:19.708 --> 04:57:19.718 align:start position:0%
um it just I see it as a as a huge
 
04:57:23.190 --> 04:57:23.200 align:start position:0%
problem okay uh representative Bixby so
 
04:57:27.190 --> 04:57:27.200 align:start position:0%
if assuming we were able to um sort out
 
04:57:30.510 --> 04:57:30.520 align:start position:0%
the statutory issues would you have any
 
04:57:32.510 --> 04:57:32.520 align:start position:0%
principled opposition to farming
 
04:57:35.030 --> 04:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
kangaroos in this
 
04:57:35.040 --> 04:57:37.788 align:start position:0%
kangaroos in this
state

04:57:37.788 --> 04:57:37.798 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:57:40.628 --> 04:57:40.638 align:start position:0%
um I I think as with anything you'd have
 
04:57:43.270 --> 04:57:43.280 align:start position:0%
to find I would unless you have a
 
04:57:46.110 --> 04:57:46.120 align:start position:0%
domesticated strain of of kangaroos
 
04:57:49.190 --> 04:57:49.200 align:start position:0%
because to put a wild animal into the
 
04:57:51.990 --> 04:57:52.000 align:start position:0%
definition of of livestock or farming is
 
04:57:52.000 --> 04:57:53.390 align:start position:0%
definition of of livestock or farming is
a

04:57:53.390 --> 04:57:53.400 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:57:56.590 --> 04:57:56.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:01.430 --> 04:58:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:06.430 --> 04:58:06.440 align:start position:0%
committee um did did you have any other
 
04:58:10.788 --> 04:58:10.798 align:start position:0%
um any other comment with regard to what
 
04:58:13.750 --> 04:58:13.760 align:start position:0%
was reported or testified To Us by
 
04:58:16.868 --> 04:58:16.878 align:start position:0%
fishing game regarding car no I I I
 
04:58:18.788 --> 04:58:18.798 align:start position:0%
think you know there there is certainly
 
04:58:20.750 --> 04:58:20.760 align:start position:0%
that issue of of the Caribou I don't
 
04:58:23.990 --> 04:58:24.000 align:start position:0%
think that you can you can or perhaps
 
04:58:25.990 --> 04:58:26.000 align:start position:0%
should even try to solve that by saying
 
04:58:27.350 --> 04:58:27.360 align:start position:0%
oh we're not going to worry about
 
04:58:28.788 --> 04:58:28.798 align:start position:0%
chronic wasting
 
04:58:31.750 --> 04:58:31.760 align:start position:0%
disease um we'll just let them come in
 
04:58:36.310 --> 04:58:36.320 align:start position:0%
and uh I I think that's a problem so uh
 
04:58:38.708 --> 04:58:38.718 align:start position:0%
I I support their their testimony into
 
04:58:41.990 --> 04:58:42.000 align:start position:0%
that in that area um and I think that
 
04:58:44.470 --> 04:58:44.480 align:start position:0%
since we don't have Caribou here why
 
04:58:46.868 --> 04:58:46.878 align:start position:0%
would we want to bring them in I'm told
 
04:58:48.230 --> 04:58:48.240 align:start position:0%
they don't even have any Caribou in
 
04:58:53.510 --> 04:58:53.520 align:start position:0%
Caribou main anymore so um really so I
 
04:58:55.030 --> 04:58:55.040 align:start position:0%
don't know where these would come from
 
04:58:58.750 --> 04:58:58.760 align:start position:0%
and again um I'm not I think we're we're
 
04:59:01.350 --> 04:59:01.360 align:start position:0%
reacting to with this Bild there's a
 
04:59:04.070 --> 04:59:04.080 align:start position:0%
reaction to something that is more gee
 
04:59:06.628 --> 04:59:06.638 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be nice if rather than we
 
04:59:09.390 --> 04:59:09.400 align:start position:0%
have testimony from people who have come
 
04:59:11.270 --> 04:59:11.280 align:start position:0%
in and say well here's a
 
04:59:15.230 --> 04:59:15.240 align:start position:0%
domesticated uh strain of caribou and
 
04:59:18.310 --> 04:59:18.320 align:start position:0%
I've had experience in raising Caribou I
 
04:59:20.030 --> 04:59:20.040 align:start position:0%
here's a domesticated strain of
 
04:59:22.430 --> 04:59:22.440 align:start position:0%
kangaroos I've had experience in doing
 
04:59:24.990 --> 04:59:25.000 align:start position:0%
that I'm uh very concerned about just
 
04:59:26.628 --> 04:59:26.638 align:start position:0%
saying oh well we'll we'll put something
 
04:59:29.310 --> 04:59:29.320 align:start position:0%
in and they will come then who's going
 
04:59:32.750 --> 04:59:32.760 align:start position:0%
to deal with with the Fallout from doing
 
04:59:35.230 --> 04:59:35.240 align:start position:0%
something that is not thought about in
 
04:59:37.670 --> 04:59:37.680 align:start position:0%
terms of how do we regulate this what's
 
04:59:40.230 --> 04:59:40.240 align:start position:0%
the what are the leave the Caribou out
 
04:59:42.510 --> 04:59:42.520 align:start position:0%
and just think about kangaroo you know
 
04:59:44.350 --> 04:59:44.360 align:start position:0%
what are we don't have any native
 
04:59:47.990 --> 04:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
kangaroos so how are we going to um deal
 
04:59:50.190 --> 04:59:50.200 align:start position:0%
with them we they're not defined as
 
04:59:52.628 --> 04:59:52.638 align:start position:0%
livestock I wouldn't want them design
 
04:59:55.270 --> 04:59:55.280 align:start position:0%
defined as livestock uh what are we
 
04:59:56.548 --> 04:59:56.558 align:start position:0%
doing to make sure that we're not
 
04:59:59.150 --> 04:59:59.160 align:start position:0%
bringing diseased animals into the state
 
05:00:01.670 --> 05:00:01.680 align:start position:0%
how are they going to be cared for
 
05:00:03.708 --> 05:00:03.718 align:start position:0%
certainly the state veterinarians don't
 
05:00:06.430 --> 05:00:06.440 align:start position:0%
have any experience in that right now
 
05:00:09.230 --> 05:00:09.240 align:start position:0%
you know we get called in on uh to
 
05:00:11.830 --> 05:00:11.840 align:start position:0%
assist the police with animal abuse
 
05:00:16.548 --> 05:00:16.558 align:start position:0%
cases how would my my people do a body
 
05:00:19.548 --> 05:00:19.558 align:start position:0%
score on kangaroos you know I don't
 
05:00:22.470 --> 05:00:22.480 align:start position:0%
believe that they've had any training on
 
05:00:25.190 --> 05:00:25.200 align:start position:0%
the care and body conditions of
 
05:00:27.390 --> 05:00:27.400 align:start position:0%
kangaroos what are they supposed to look
 
05:00:29.310 --> 05:00:29.320 align:start position:0%
look like if they're healthy what do
 
05:00:31.310 --> 05:00:31.320 align:start position:0%
they look like if they're not how do we
 
05:00:34.510 --> 05:00:34.520 align:start position:0%
do this I mean there is a whole lot of
 
05:00:37.510 --> 05:00:37.520 align:start position:0%
things here that aren't thought about in
 
05:00:39.430 --> 05:00:39.440 align:start position:0%
this bill it's just like okay let's just
 
05:00:41.070 --> 05:00:41.080 align:start position:0%
do this
 
05:00:43.030 --> 05:00:43.040 align:start position:0%
um just just throwing a bomb into the
 
05:00:45.670 --> 05:00:45.680 align:start position:0%
middle of things we actually haven't had
 
05:00:48.590 --> 05:00:48.600 align:start position:0%
any testimony submitted from the state
 
05:00:51.510 --> 05:00:51.520 align:start position:0%
veterinarian and I wonder if um if you
 
05:00:54.190 --> 05:00:54.200 align:start position:0%
may reach out to him and ask uh for him
 
05:00:57.310 --> 05:00:57.320 align:start position:0%
to submit some sort of opinion or
 
05:01:00.948 --> 05:01:00.958 align:start position:0%
thoughts regarding um regarding this
 
05:01:03.430 --> 05:01:03.440 align:start position:0%
bill I mean aside from the Caribou piece
 
05:01:05.910 --> 05:01:05.920 align:start position:0%
which we already understand that there's
 
05:01:05.920 --> 05:01:07.788 align:start position:0%
which we already understand that there's
a

05:01:07.788 --> 05:01:07.798 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:01:10.628 --> 05:01:10.638 align:start position:0%
very possible issue of chronic wasting
 
05:01:13.070 --> 05:01:13.080 align:start position:0%
disease but I'd be interested to know if
 
05:01:15.948 --> 05:01:15.958 align:start position:0%
there if he has any uh if he would like
 
05:01:19.110 --> 05:01:19.120 align:start position:0%
to weigh in at all with any kind of a
 
05:01:22.628 --> 05:01:22.638 align:start position:0%
zootic issue having to do with
 
05:01:25.670 --> 05:01:25.680 align:start position:0%
kangaroo I I can certainly ask him he's
 
05:01:27.868 --> 05:01:27.878 align:start position:0%
very very busy and so if this is
 
05:01:29.910 --> 05:01:29.920 align:start position:0%
something that this committee is
 
05:01:33.868 --> 05:01:33.878 align:start position:0%
seriously considering passing then I
 
05:01:35.788 --> 05:01:35.798 align:start position:0%
could task him with that I would rather
 
05:01:39.470 --> 05:01:39.480 align:start position:0%
not if um if my concerns have haven't
 
05:01:41.990 --> 05:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
been enough to say we need to look at
 
05:01:43.990 --> 05:01:44.000 align:start position:0%
this more if you're saying well
 
05:01:46.390 --> 05:01:46.400 align:start position:0%
commissioner if you know if we don't get
 
05:01:48.230 --> 05:01:48.240 align:start position:0%
testimony from the State Veterinary and
 
05:01:49.708 --> 05:01:49.718 align:start position:0%
we're probably going to pass it okay
 
05:01:52.110 --> 05:01:52.120 align:start position:0%
I'll do it but I really no no that's not
 
05:01:54.628 --> 05:01:54.638 align:start position:0%
my int no I understand I'm just saying
 
05:01:57.390 --> 05:01:57.400 align:start position:0%
he is so backed up with so many things
 
05:02:00.510 --> 05:02:00.520 align:start position:0%
it's an area I know he has no expertise
 
05:02:02.708 --> 05:02:02.718 align:start position:0%
in I can assure you that the state
 
05:02:04.948 --> 05:02:04.958 align:start position:0%
veterinarian has never dealt with a
 
05:02:09.590 --> 05:02:09.600 align:start position:0%
kangaroo and so asking them for for this
 
05:02:12.070 --> 05:02:12.080 align:start position:0%
to to spend time I mean I I appreciate
 
05:02:14.310 --> 05:02:14.320 align:start position:0%
what you're looking for but I really
 
05:02:15.990 --> 05:02:16.000 align:start position:0%
hate to task him with this if I don't
 
05:02:16.000 --> 05:02:17.430 align:start position:0%
hate to task him with this if I don't
have

05:02:17.430 --> 05:02:17.440 align:start position:0%
have
 
05:02:20.590 --> 05:02:20.600 align:start position:0%
to represent Penza I wouldn't have had a
 
05:02:22.430 --> 05:02:22.440 align:start position:0%
question but because you kept having
 
05:02:24.390 --> 05:02:24.400 align:start position:0%
some excellent testimony now I have a
 
05:02:28.948 --> 05:02:28.958 align:start position:0%
question so okay so let's say that um
 
05:02:30.990 --> 05:02:31.000 align:start position:0%
you know a group from let's say it be
 
05:02:34.110 --> 05:02:34.120 align:start position:0%
Texas or Wisconsin and they have been
 
05:02:35.470 --> 05:02:35.480 align:start position:0%
producing this they want to come to the
 
05:02:37.628 --> 05:02:37.638 align:start position:0%
live for your die State whether it be
 
05:02:40.548 --> 05:02:40.558 align:start position:0%
Caribou or whether it be kangaroo would
 
05:02:43.548 --> 05:02:43.558 align:start position:0%
the department um and do you think would
 
05:02:45.830 --> 05:02:45.840 align:start position:0%
fishing game be willing if there's
 
05:02:48.590 --> 05:02:48.600 align:start position:0%
someone that has you know background
 
05:02:50.868 --> 05:02:50.878 align:start position:0%
expertise have done this in another
 
05:02:53.510 --> 05:02:53.520 align:start position:0%
state that is in operation would we be
 
05:02:57.270 --> 05:02:57.280 align:start position:0%
willing to look at it well I'm I'm going
 
05:02:59.310 --> 05:02:59.320 align:start position:0%
to tell you I would put that on fish a
 
05:03:01.430 --> 05:03:01.440 align:start position:0%
game I know the answer to Caribou
 
05:03:03.270 --> 05:03:03.280 align:start position:0%
because of the testimony we've heard
 
05:03:08.470 --> 05:03:08.480 align:start position:0%
here I again would be opposed to putting
 
05:03:11.030 --> 05:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
kangaroo in at
 
05:03:13.868 --> 05:03:13.878 align:start position:0%
livestock um so that would go back to
 
05:03:15.510 --> 05:03:15.520 align:start position:0%
fishing game how would they like to
 
05:03:17.310 --> 05:03:17.320 align:start position:0%
handle it I would just tell you this
 
05:03:20.510 --> 05:03:20.520 align:start position:0%
isn't you know by by talking about Farm
 
05:03:20.520 --> 05:03:21.788 align:start position:0%
isn't you know by by talking about Farm
rais

05:03:21.788 --> 05:03:21.798 align:start position:0%
rais
 
05:03:25.470 --> 05:03:25.480 align:start position:0%
kangaroos um you really need to amend
 
05:03:29.030 --> 05:03:29.040 align:start position:0%
the definition of farming and of
 
05:03:31.390 --> 05:03:31.400 align:start position:0%
livestock which I would oppose because I
 
05:03:34.190 --> 05:03:34.200 align:start position:0%
believe these are wild animals not aware
 
05:03:36.788 --> 05:03:36.798 align:start position:0%
of domestic strains I mean I suppose if
 
05:03:38.548 --> 05:03:38.558 align:start position:0%
somebody oh yeah here's how you
 
05:03:42.350 --> 05:03:42.360 align:start position:0%
domesticate it I we're off to this you
 
05:03:44.910 --> 05:03:44.920 align:start position:0%
know this area that I don't even know
 
05:03:46.070 --> 05:03:46.080 align:start position:0%
why we're going there because you don't
 
05:03:48.150 --> 05:03:48.160 align:start position:0%
have anybody here coming saying Hey I
 
05:03:50.190 --> 05:03:50.200 align:start position:0%
want to start farming Kangaroos and
 
05:03:52.868 --> 05:03:52.878 align:start position:0%
we're taking up this this time and you
 
05:03:53.990 --> 05:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
know I appreciate that's what the
 
05:03:57.670 --> 05:03:57.680 align:start position:0%
legislature does but please unless
 
05:03:59.910 --> 05:03:59.920 align:start position:0%
you're serious about hey we think
 
05:04:03.030 --> 05:04:03.040 align:start position:0%
kangaroo farming is the greatest thing
 
05:04:07.590 --> 05:04:07.600 align:start position:0%
since sliced bread I mean please yeah
 
05:04:10.190 --> 05:04:10.200 align:start position:0%
I'm really more on the Caribou side than
 
05:04:12.190 --> 05:04:12.200 align:start position:0%
kangaroo side but and that that's simply
 
05:04:14.350 --> 05:04:14.360 align:start position:0%
you know I can tell you that Santa's
 
05:04:16.910 --> 05:04:16.920 align:start position:0%
Village they are getting in a in a
 
05:04:20.390 --> 05:04:20.400 align:start position:0%
situation where their genetics is is
 
05:04:23.628 --> 05:04:23.638 align:start position:0%
very questionable and they have some
 
05:04:26.470 --> 05:04:26.480 align:start position:0%
great protocols um they're not going to
 
05:04:29.190 --> 05:04:29.200 align:start position:0%
be allowed to bring um more of those
 
05:04:31.670 --> 05:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
reindeer in and so certainly and they're
 
05:04:33.788 --> 05:04:33.798 align:start position:0%
already here so certainly for fishing
 
05:04:35.230 --> 05:04:35.240 align:start position:0%
game to say oh yeah let's bring
 
05:04:38.190 --> 05:04:38.200 align:start position:0%
something in we don't have so is Santa's
 
05:04:42.670 --> 05:04:42.680 align:start position:0%
Village gonna eventually not have
 
05:04:46.070 --> 05:04:46.080 align:start position:0%
reindeer oh no okay I'm not I I I I
 
05:04:48.350 --> 05:04:48.360 align:start position:0%
can't I can't speak for them I'm telling
 
05:04:50.030 --> 05:04:50.040 align:start position:0%
you it's a concern and I've been
 
05:04:52.548 --> 05:04:52.558 align:start position:0%
involved in in discussions on that and
 
05:04:54.910 --> 05:04:54.920 align:start position:0%
and right now they are not being allowed
 
05:04:57.910 --> 05:04:57.920 align:start position:0%
to import anymore so representative
 
05:05:02.030 --> 05:05:02.040 align:start position:0%
Bixby all right so um just a quick note
 
05:05:04.070 --> 05:05:04.080 align:start position:0%
before I launch into my skeptical end of
 
05:05:06.070 --> 05:05:06.080 align:start position:0%
things which is that when I was visiting
 
05:05:08.070 --> 05:05:08.080 align:start position:0%
Australia I did have kangaroo it was
 
05:05:10.510 --> 05:05:10.520 align:start position:0%
very tasty it was much like venison
 
05:05:13.670 --> 05:05:13.680 align:start position:0%
uh however um what I one of the things
 
05:05:16.430 --> 05:05:16.440 align:start position:0%
that I thought of immediately when this
 
05:05:21.788 --> 05:05:21.798 align:start position:0%
bill came across our um list was uh the
 
05:05:24.548 --> 05:05:24.558 align:start position:0%
study committee that we did last fall on
 
05:05:26.708 --> 05:05:26.718 align:start position:0%
the lack of Slaughter facilities and
 
05:05:29.030 --> 05:05:29.040 align:start position:0%
processing facilities for meat and I'm
 
05:05:31.350 --> 05:05:31.360 align:start position:0%
just wondering what sort of impact this
 
05:05:35.430 --> 05:05:35.440 align:start position:0%
would have on the uh existing problems
 
05:05:38.670 --> 05:05:38.680 align:start position:0%
in Slaughter and processing this is a is
 
05:05:41.708 --> 05:05:41.718 align:start position:0%
listed as a non amable species so it
 
05:05:43.830 --> 05:05:43.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to go through the normal
 
05:05:46.948 --> 05:05:46.958 align:start position:0%
inspection it's got to be the postmortem
 
05:05:49.230 --> 05:05:49.240 align:start position:0%
under the the statute inspected post
 
05:05:51.990 --> 05:05:52.000 align:start position:0%
morning by a veterinarian um again I'm
 
05:05:54.430 --> 05:05:54.440 align:start position:0%
not sure because I'm not a veterinarian
 
05:05:56.830 --> 05:05:56.840 align:start position:0%
never wanted to be a veterinarian um
 
05:05:58.948 --> 05:05:58.958 align:start position:0%
what they would be looking for what they
 
05:06:01.030 --> 05:06:01.040 align:start position:0%
would be trained to look for in kangaroo
 
05:06:03.030 --> 05:06:03.040 align:start position:0%
meat I don't I don't know if that's easy
 
05:06:06.510 --> 05:06:06.520 align:start position:0%
if it's not um so again we don't have a
 
05:06:09.590 --> 05:06:09.600 align:start position:0%
veterinarian here to say oh yeah this is
 
05:06:11.230 --> 05:06:11.240 align:start position:0%
is easy for me to do this because this
 
05:06:14.948 --> 05:06:14.958 align:start position:0%
is about on Farm Slaughter of kangaroos
 
05:06:19.510 --> 05:06:19.520 align:start position:0%
without uh going through the USDA
 
05:06:22.310 --> 05:06:22.320 align:start position:0%
process representative Howard thank you
 
05:06:24.150 --> 05:06:24.160 align:start position:0%
madam chair um I just have one quick
 
05:06:26.390 --> 05:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
question and that is are you surprised
 
05:06:28.270 --> 05:06:28.280 align:start position:0%
to find yourself talking about kangaroos
 
05:06:29.510 --> 05:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
again in this
 
05:06:32.270 --> 05:06:32.280 align:start position:0%
session well I knew it was on the list
 
05:06:34.910 --> 05:06:34.920 align:start position:0%
so I'm not surprised but I was surprised
 
05:06:36.430 --> 05:06:36.440 align:start position:0%
there were two bills dealing with
 
05:06:36.440 --> 05:06:38.510 align:start position:0%
there were two bills dealing with
kangaroos

05:06:38.510 --> 05:06:38.520 align:start position:0%
kangaroos
 
05:06:40.788 --> 05:06:40.798 align:start position:0%
yes any other questions for the

we oh yeah we had at 2:30 scheduled a
 
05:10:21.270 --> 05:10:21.280 align:start position:0%
work session for hb1 1575 HP 1698 and HP
 
05:10:29.390 --> 05:10:29.400 align:start position:0%
1703 um HP 1575 we have already um exact
 
05:10:30.948 --> 05:10:30.958 align:start position:0%
so I don't know if you want to take any
 
05:10:33.910 --> 05:10:33.920 align:start position:0%
time right now to talk about HB
 
05:10:36.390 --> 05:10:36.400 align:start position:0%
1698 or HP
 
05:10:40.230 --> 05:10:40.240 align:start position:0%
1703 we could um
 
05:10:43.788 --> 05:10:43.798 align:start position:0%
add that next week at 10 o'clock we're
 
05:10:47.310 --> 05:10:47.320 align:start position:0%
going to have a work session on the
 
05:10:51.910 --> 05:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
paint recycle Bill and also the Drone
 
05:10:54.788 --> 05:10:54.798 align:start position:0%
bill because I'm planning on working on
 
05:10:57.110 --> 05:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
an amendment to bring to the committee
 
05:11:01.750 --> 05:11:01.760 align:start position:0%
to fix that 55 pound limit for drones
 
05:11:04.830 --> 05:11:04.840 align:start position:0%
and I I think I have a solution for that
 
05:11:08.150 --> 05:11:08.160 align:start position:0%
um referring to a different section of
 
05:11:12.628 --> 05:11:12.638 align:start position:0%
um uh of New Hampshire law actually um
 
05:11:16.030 --> 05:11:16.040 align:start position:0%
there is a a a section below the section
 
05:11:21.590 --> 05:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
that I that's mentioned um instead
 
05:11:23.470 --> 05:11:23.480 align:start position:0%
of let's
 
05:11:26.830 --> 05:11:26.840 align:start position:0%
see where is
 
05:11:26.840 --> 05:11:29.548 align:start position:0%
see where is
it

05:11:29.548 --> 05:11:29.558 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:11:34.510 --> 05:11:34.520 align:start position:0%
yes instead of where I mentioned uh
 
05:11:36.788 --> 05:11:36.798 align:start position:0%
using unmanned aircraft as designed
 
05:11:40.310 --> 05:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
defined in RSA 422 colon 3
 
05:11:44.030 --> 05:11:44.040 align:start position:0%
three Roman numeral 27-a I think it's
 
05:11:48.110 --> 05:11:48.120 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral 30 that we can use that
 
05:11:51.230 --> 05:11:51.240 align:start position:0%
refers to unmanned
 
05:11:56.070 --> 05:11:56.080 align:start position:0%
aircraft not small unmanned aircraft so
 
05:11:59.910 --> 05:11:59.920 align:start position:0%
I think that will fix that issue and um
 
05:12:02.548 --> 05:12:02.558 align:start position:0%
well I'll I'll prepare the amendment um
 
05:12:05.750 --> 05:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
but I'm going to talk to um Farm Bureau
 
05:12:07.788 --> 05:12:07.798 align:start position:0%
and some other folks and see if we can
 
05:12:10.310 --> 05:12:10.320 align:start position:0%
get that straightened out sub to OS and
 
05:12:13.030 --> 05:12:13.040 align:start position:0%
bring that back to us representative com
 
05:12:14.390 --> 05:12:14.400 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I think it's
 
05:12:17.990 --> 05:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
imperative that um we get that the
 
05:12:20.070 --> 05:12:20.080 align:start position:0%
amendment and I think it's uh and we
 
05:12:22.708 --> 05:12:22.718 align:start position:0%
pass that next week uh it will be an
 
05:12:25.350 --> 05:12:25.360 align:start position:0%
absolute useful tool for Farmers uh
 
05:12:26.948 --> 05:12:26.958 align:start position:0%
going forward
 
05:12:30.708 --> 05:12:30.718 align:start position:0%
absolutely so um so in so far as like a
 
05:12:33.190 --> 05:12:33.200 align:start position:0%
work session now I mean I'm just telling
 
05:12:35.350 --> 05:12:35.360 align:start position:0%
you what I'm going to do with that bill
 
05:12:37.788 --> 05:12:37.798 align:start position:0%
and make an amendment representative
 
05:12:41.030 --> 05:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
Bixby so I think uh clearly the the
 
05:12:42.430 --> 05:12:42.440 align:start position:0%
Drone bill is something that we'll want
 
05:12:45.110 --> 05:12:45.120 align:start position:0%
to discuss a little bit further on on
 
05:12:47.750 --> 05:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
next Tuesday and I'm glad that you have
 
05:12:49.830 --> 05:12:49.840 align:start position:0%
a fix that you have in mind for that
 
05:12:52.030 --> 05:12:52.040 align:start position:0%
because I think it's an important bill
 
05:12:56.470 --> 05:12:56.480 align:start position:0%
um and as for other the other bill um
 
05:12:58.190 --> 05:12:58.200 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that we could consider the
 
05:13:01.150 --> 05:13:01.160 align:start position:0%
kangaroo an important bill uh and I'm
 
05:13:03.190 --> 05:13:03.200 align:start position:0%
not sure that we need to spend much time
 
05:13:04.948 --> 05:13:04.958 align:start position:0%
discussing that next Tuesday morning I
 
05:13:07.830 --> 05:13:07.840 align:start position:0%
don't know is there I maybe we could
 
05:13:09.670 --> 05:13:09.680 align:start position:0%
take a poll right now as see if there's
 
05:13:11.948 --> 05:13:11.958 align:start position:0%
anyone who feels that we need to move
 
05:13:14.070 --> 05:13:14.080 align:start position:0%
forward with that either as an OTP
 
05:13:18.830 --> 05:13:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:22.830 --> 05:13:22.840 align:start position:0%
is no I would yeah I would itl it number
 
05:13:25.390 --> 05:13:25.400 align:start position:0%
one first of all even if the bill was
 
05:13:28.190 --> 05:13:28.200 align:start position:0%
amended to remove Caribou I think the
 
05:13:30.350 --> 05:13:30.360 align:start position:0%
issues that the commissioner has brought
 
05:13:33.788 --> 05:13:33.798 align:start position:0%
out with difference of um issues within
 
05:13:36.830 --> 05:13:36.840 align:start position:0%
the statutes do we want to
 
05:13:40.230 --> 05:13:40.240 align:start position:0%
consider uh kangaroo as far Farm uh as a
 
05:13:42.990 --> 05:13:43.000 align:start position:0%
farm animal and and go into that whole
 
05:13:46.150 --> 05:13:46.160 align:start position:0%
thing but mostly I mean we don't see a
 
05:13:48.430 --> 05:13:48.440 align:start position:0%
bunch of people testifying here that say
 
05:13:50.590 --> 05:13:50.600 align:start position:0%
they want to start a kangaroo farm and
 
05:13:53.990 --> 05:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
so I think that it's an issue that you
 
05:13:57.310 --> 05:13:57.320 align:start position:0%
know we really is not something that's
 
05:14:00.430 --> 05:14:00.440 align:start position:0%
uh you know shaking that that's Earth
 
05:14:04.750 --> 05:14:04.760 align:start position:0%
shaking here I would agree okay anybody
 
05:14:08.470 --> 05:14:08.480 align:start position:0%
else okay um I think then our work for
 
05:14:10.230 --> 05:14:10.240 align:start position:0%
this after afternoon is done I want to
 
05:14:11.990 --> 05:14:12.000 align:start position:0%

bills we are done with those today and
 
05:14:18.110 --> 05:14:18.120 align:start position:0%
the next set of hearings we would have
 
05:14:19.990 --> 05:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
is uh any kind of Senate bills that come
 
05:14:22.110 --> 05:14:22.120 align:start position:0%
