00:08:18.149 --> 00:08:18.159 align:start position:0%
me uh yes you might want to speak up
 
00:08:20.469 --> 00:08:20.479 align:start position:0%
just a little bit all right I will do
 
00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:23.960 align:start position:0%
that um good morning everyone um my name
 
00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:27.280 align:start position:0%
is Bob Lynn um I'm the retired Chief
 
00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:28.720 align:start position:0%
Justice of the New Hampshire Supreme
 
00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
Court and I'm now a representative from
 
00:08:33.829 --> 00:08:33.839 align:start position:0%
Windham uh thank you for allowing me to
 
00:08:39.149 --> 00:08:39.159 align:start position:0%
appear today I appear um in support of
 
00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:42.800 align:start position:0%
uh this uh measure which would which
 
00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:46.240 align:start position:0%
proposes uh for I should emphasize right
 
00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:48.720 align:start position:0%
at the beginning this would apply only
 
00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:53.800 align:start position:0%
to judges appointed after uh this bill
 
00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:56.200 align:start position:0%
uh becomes law assuming it assuming it
 
00:08:59.509 --> 00:08:59.519 align:start position:0%
does become law um and it proposes
 
00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
changes to the judicial retirement plan
 
00:09:07.829 --> 00:09:07.839 align:start position:0%
um basically the the Genesis of of this
 
00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:09.440 align:start position:0%
proposal which was
 
00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:11.600 align:start position:0%
originally um brought before the
 
00:09:17.269 --> 00:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
legislature in uh 2019 I believe and um
 
00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
was was not acted upon then there there
 
00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:22.720 align:start position:0%
was at least some talk of having a study
 
00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:24.320 align:start position:0%
committee I I don't believe that that
 
00:09:25.829 --> 00:09:25.839 align:start position:0%
actually ever
 
00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:27.800 align:start position:0%
happened but there was some talk about
 
00:09:30.389 --> 00:09:30.399 align:start position:0%
it at the time at anyway the Genesis of
 
00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:33.480 align:start position:0%
of this proposal is that
 
00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:37.120 align:start position:0%
um the simple fact is that over the long
 
00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
Hall the current structure of the
 
00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:43.880 align:start position:0%
judicial retirement plan is is not
 
00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:47.360 align:start position:0%
sustainable at sort of re at at any kind
 
00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:50.440 align:start position:0%
of reasonable cost and so this proposes
 
00:09:55.630 --> 00:09:55.640 align:start position:0%
to make some changes um to uh the system
 
00:09:59.110 --> 00:09:59.120 align:start position:0%
um and let me let me give you a sort of
 
00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
two two points that I think are very
 
00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:03.680 align:start position:0%
important to understand first one of the
 
00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:05.800 align:start position:0%
pro problems which is kind of inherent I
 
00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:08.120 align:start position:0%
think in the judicial retirement plan is
 
00:10:10.829 --> 00:10:10.839 align:start position:0%
that it's a very small plan and compared
 
00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:12.360 align:start position:0%
to the regular State Employees
 
00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:15.680 align:start position:0%
Retirement System it's a tiny uh plan
 
00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:18.920 align:start position:0%
there just aren't that many uh judges um
 
00:10:22.269 --> 00:10:22.279 align:start position:0%
to give you another uh point which I
 
00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:24.680 align:start position:0%
think kind of brings home part of the
 
00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
problem is that um
 
00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:31.120 align:start position:0%
the uh Mr head from the uh Attorney
 
00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:33.720 align:start position:0%
Richard headed from the uh uh
 
00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:35.160 align:start position:0%
Administrative Office of the courts I
 
00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:36.800 align:start position:0%
believe will be here to testify and he
 
00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:39.000 align:start position:0%
can give you some more recent
 
00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:42.440 align:start position:0%
information but as of the as of the time
 
00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:47.160 align:start position:0%
that um I prepared the initial proposal
 
00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:48.200 align:start position:0%
uh back in
 
00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:51.040 align:start position:0%
2019 at that time there were
 
00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:54.440 align:start position:0%
58 active members of the judicial
 
00:10:56.590 --> 00:10:56.600 align:start position:0%
retirement plan who were contributing to
 
00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:00.720 align:start position:0%
the plan and at that time there were 66
 
00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:04.720 align:start position:0%
people collecting benefits um and that
 
00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:07.600 align:start position:0%
consisted of retired judges judges Who
 
00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:10.720 align:start position:0%
had who had uh uh retired on a
 
00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:13.160 align:start position:0%
disability uh plus the spouses of those
 
00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:14.720 align:start position:0%
judges so in other words there there
 
00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:17.720 align:start position:0%
were more people collecting benefits
 
00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:19.560 align:start position:0%
under the judicial retirement plan than
 
00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:23.480 align:start position:0%
there were people contributing uh to the
 
00:11:26.069 --> 00:11:26.079 align:start position:0%
plan one of the things that the judicial
 
00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:30.160 align:start position:0%
Retirement Board of Trustees um
 
00:11:32.629 --> 00:11:32.639 align:start position:0%
uh sort of brought into the mix on this
 
00:11:32.639 --> 00:11:33.949 align:start position:0%
uh sort of brought into the mix on this
was

00:11:33.949 --> 00:11:33.959 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:37.880 align:start position:0%
that again I'm I'm using 2019 numbers
 
00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:41.120 align:start position:0%
but that at the at the time at that
 
00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
time the state's
 
00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:47.680 align:start position:0%
contribution to the pension uh of every
 
00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:52.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:54.990 --> 00:11:55.000 align:start position:0%
75.4% of the judge's salary so that
 
00:11:58.269 --> 00:11:58.279 align:start position:0%
means that every two weeks um when the
 
00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:00.200 align:start position:0%
when a judge would issue would be issued
 
00:12:02.629 --> 00:12:02.639 align:start position:0%
a paycheck the state would not only pay
 
00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:05.320 align:start position:0%
the the paycheck but would also have to
 
00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:09.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:13.720 align:start position:0%
75.4% to the judicial retirement plan it
 
00:12:16.829 --> 00:12:16.839 align:start position:0%
was projected at that time by Millum
 
00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:19.480 align:start position:0%
that by
 
00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:22.920 align:start position:0%
2035 the percentage contribution by the
 
00:12:27.389 --> 00:12:27.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:31.509 --> 00:12:31.519 align:start position:0%
93.3% um and it and you know and it
 
00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
going out even further likely would come
 
00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:35.360 align:start position:0%
to the point where where it was
 
00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:39.680 align:start position:0%
essentially 100% or maybe even more um
 
00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:41.600 align:start position:0%
this proposal and again I I want to
 
00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:44.320 align:start position:0%
emphasize that Mr headed maybe uh one of
 
00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:45.320 align:start position:0%
the things he's going to tell you I
 
00:12:48.509 --> 00:12:48.519 align:start position:0%
think is that um the judicial branch is
 
00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
is asking the seagull consulting firm
 
00:12:54.110 --> 00:12:54.120 align:start position:0%
which was a a very well respected
 
00:12:56.590 --> 00:12:56.600 align:start position:0%
consulting firm that we had uh retained
 
00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
back in 2019 to give us some numbers um
 
00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:02.760 align:start position:0%
that they've asked them to to provide
 
00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:05.680 align:start position:0%
more recent information on this and I
 
00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:07.560 align:start position:0%
think that's actually a very good idea
 
00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
but seagull uh
 
00:13:13.949 --> 00:13:13.959 align:start position:0%
uh told us that under the proposal that
 
00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:16.720 align:start position:0%
uh that is before you now that would
 
00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:20.760 align:start position:0%
reduce the um uh extent of the state's
 
00:13:24.509 --> 00:13:24.519 align:start position:0%
contribution from by around from uh
 
00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:27.560 align:start position:0%
projected of two 2035 from
 
00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
93% to to 68% now I'm the first to admit
 
00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:33.320 align:start position:0%
that 68% is still a pretty high
 
00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:35.120 align:start position:0%
percentage but it's a lot better than
 
00:13:38.949 --> 00:13:38.959 align:start position:0%
93% and as and as I say I think that if
 
00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:43.160 align:start position:0%
if if you're going to retain a defined
 
00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:46.480 align:start position:0%
benefit um retirement
 
00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:49.760 align:start position:0%
plan with a with a a group that's this
 
00:13:51.189 --> 00:13:51.199 align:start position:0%
small I'm not sure that you're going to
 
00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:53.560 align:start position:0%
be able to do you know significantly
 
00:13:57.230 --> 00:13:57.240 align:start position:0%
better than that if I can just uh U take
 
00:13:58.710 --> 00:13:58.720 align:start position:0%
a couple of minutes and I'll and I'll
 
00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:00.720 align:start position:0%
I'll try to be as brief as possible to
 
00:14:04.069 --> 00:14:04.079 align:start position:0%
go over what um what this proposal would
 
00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:08.160 align:start position:0%
do and I did send a um a memo I don't
 
00:14:09.629 --> 00:14:09.639 align:start position:0%
know if if members of the committee
 
00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:11.880 align:start position:0%
received that I sent it yesterday it was
 
00:14:14.069 --> 00:14:14.079 align:start position:0%
a basically a copy of a of a memo that I
 
00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:16.600 align:start position:0%
had sent to John forella the governor's
 
00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
Council back in
 
00:14:21.389 --> 00:14:21.399 align:start position:0%
2019 summarizing what this proposal
 
00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:23.800 align:start position:0%
would do U but let me just sort of
 
00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:27.680 align:start position:0%
briefly review it um first it would
 
00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:31.000 align:start position:0%
increase the minimum retirement age for
 
00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:34.680 align:start position:0%
judges um with 15 years of service it
 
00:14:38.749 --> 00:14:38.759 align:start position:0%
would increase it from 60 to 62 with 10
 
00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:40.600 align:start position:0%
years of service it would increase it
 
00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:41.470 align:start position:0%
years of service it would increase it
from

00:14:41.470 --> 00:14:41.480 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:14:43.829 --> 00:14:43.839 align:start position:0%
65 uh to
 
00:14:48.949 --> 00:14:48.959 align:start position:0%
67 um it would change the calculation of
 
00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:52.440 align:start position:0%
uh the retirement benefit right
 
00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:56.560 align:start position:0%
now um a judge can retire at age 60 with
 
00:15:00.430 --> 00:15:00.440 align:start position:0%
15 years of service at 70% of the
 
00:15:03.749 --> 00:15:03.759 align:start position:0%
judge's last year salary or can retire
 
00:15:08.629 --> 00:15:08.639 align:start position:0%
at 65 with 10 years of service at 75% of
 
00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:11.720 align:start position:0%
the judge's salary this proposal would
 
00:15:16.069 --> 00:15:16.079 align:start position:0%
change the formula to say that a a judge
 
00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
could retire with 15 years of service at
 
00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
age 62 with 10 years of service at age
 
00:15:27.949 --> 00:15:27.959 align:start position:0%
67 um or with um uh seven years of
 
00:15:31.949 --> 00:15:31.959 align:start position:0%
service at age 70 but the formula would
 
00:15:34.749 --> 00:15:34.759 align:start position:0%
be would be based on
 
00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:37.560 align:start position:0%
4% you the judge would receive a a
 
00:15:38.749 --> 00:15:38.759 align:start position:0%
pension of
 
00:15:42.189 --> 00:15:42.199 align:start position:0%
4% times the number of years of
 
00:15:46.749 --> 00:15:46.759 align:start position:0%
service there are also um some changes
 
00:15:48.829 --> 00:15:48.839 align:start position:0%
under the current system which is which
 
00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
is different from the from the
 
00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:52.920 align:start position:0%
retirement the regular New Hamshire
 
00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
retirement system there is no allowance
 
00:16:00.189 --> 00:16:00.199 align:start position:0%
made uh no differentiation made of
 
00:16:03.749 --> 00:16:03.759 align:start position:0%
whether a judge takes an individual
 
00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:07.360 align:start position:0%
annuity or um a joint annuity with a
 
00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:11.440 align:start position:0%
spouse um and so in in in a
 
00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:15.680 align:start position:0%
sense um that is sort of unfair to a
 
00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:18.800 align:start position:0%
judge uh who is who was unmarried um
 
00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:20.720 align:start position:0%
because there's under under most
 
00:16:22.949 --> 00:16:22.959 align:start position:0%
retirement plans if if a if a judge
 
00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
elects to take a joint annuity there is
 
00:16:29.389 --> 00:16:29.399 align:start position:0%
there is generally some reduction
 
00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
in the amount that the judge gets during
 
00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:34.240 align:start position:0%
his or her lifetime to account for the
 
00:16:36.189 --> 00:16:36.199 align:start position:0%
fact that the the annuity will continue
 
00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:39.160 align:start position:0%
during The spouse's lifetime this would
 
00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:41.120 align:start position:0%
change that to provide that there would
 
00:16:44.309 --> 00:16:44.319 align:start position:0%
be such an Actuarial reduction so it
 
00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:47.480 align:start position:0%
would it would um it would
 
00:16:50.069 --> 00:16:50.079 align:start position:0%
equitably allow for the retirement of of
 
00:16:53.470 --> 00:16:53.480 align:start position:0%
either a single or a or a married um
 
00:16:59.590 --> 00:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
judge it would also change um the uh
 
00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
the manner in which uh uh pensions would
 
00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:07.240 align:start position:0%
be paid to a judge um who who went out
 
00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:08.240 align:start position:0%
on a
 
00:17:12.029 --> 00:17:12.039 align:start position:0%
disability um uh and it would CH and it
 
00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
would also the other important point is
 
00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:19.720 align:start position:0%
it would change the um the way the
 
00:17:22.829 --> 00:17:22.839 align:start position:0%
spousal um benefit is paid right now
 
00:17:25.309 --> 00:17:25.319 align:start position:0%
unlike most pension plans and I believe
 
00:17:27.669 --> 00:17:27.679 align:start position:0%
the including the the regular State
 
00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:32.640 align:start position:0%
retiree Pension Plan um the under normal
 
00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:36.520 align:start position:0%
pension plan it uh a spouse normally
 
00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:37.710 align:start position:0%
pension plan it uh a spouse normally
receives

00:17:37.710 --> 00:17:37.720 align:start position:0%
receives
 
00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:41.480 align:start position:0%
50% of the benefit that the retiree was
 
00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
receiving under the current judicial uh
 
00:17:48.029 --> 00:17:48.039 align:start position:0%
pension plan that the the the spouse
 
00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:49.600 align:start position:0%
actually receives
 
00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:52.640 align:start position:0%
50% of the of the
 
00:17:55.630 --> 00:17:55.640 align:start position:0%
judge's uh last year salary which is
 
00:17:57.149 --> 00:17:57.159 align:start position:0%
which would is considerably more than
 
00:18:01.909 --> 00:18:01.919 align:start position:0%
50% of the judges um pension so that
 
00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:04.520 align:start position:0%
would that would change that it would
 
00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:08.640 align:start position:0%
also provide um another I think sort of
 
00:18:11.149 --> 00:18:11.159 align:start position:0%
pretty important provision is that it
 
00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:15.400 align:start position:0%
would provide that a that if a judge
 
00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:19.120 align:start position:0%
went out on disability the judge would
 
00:18:22.909 --> 00:18:22.919 align:start position:0%
receive um 70% of the judge's last year
 
00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:28.440 align:start position:0%
salary but that 70% would only apply
 
00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
until the judge re reached age 70 at
 
00:18:34.549 --> 00:18:34.559 align:start position:0%
which point the pension would would
 
00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:37.320 align:start position:0%
revert to whatever the pension would
 
00:18:40.669 --> 00:18:40.679 align:start position:0%
have been if the judge had retired at
 
00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
age 70 and I I think this what what this
 
00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
is designed to prevent is this kind of a
 
00:18:49.789 --> 00:18:49.799 align:start position:0%
situation suppose that a judge U went on
 
00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:51.640 align:start position:0%
the bench at
 
00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:55.200 align:start position:0%
60 um and became disabled at
 
00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:00.760 align:start position:0%
61 um well that would that would mean
 
00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:02.600 align:start position:0%
that if there without this the provision
 
00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:03.960 align:start position:0%
I've just discussed what that would mean
 
00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:05.960 align:start position:0%
is that the judge would get 70% of his
 
00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:08.520 align:start position:0%
salary or her salary for the remainder
 
00:19:10.990 --> 00:19:11.000 align:start position:0%
of the judge's life whereas if the judge
 
00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:15.080 align:start position:0%
had served 10 years and had then retired
 
00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:17.960 align:start position:0%
at the mandatory age of 70 the judge
 
00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
under this new formula would only
 
00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:21.640 align:start position:0%
receive a pension of
 
00:19:24.669 --> 00:19:24.679 align:start position:0%
40% so what the what the what this
 
00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:27.880 align:start position:0%
proposal says is yes you you will if you
 
00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:30.400 align:start position:0%
become disabled you will get the 70% of
 
00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:32.720 align:start position:0%
your salary from the time of your
 
00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:35.720 align:start position:0%
disability until you reach the maximum
 
00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:38.640 align:start position:0%
retirement age and at that point you you
 
00:19:40.789 --> 00:19:40.799 align:start position:0%
will get the pension that you would have
 
00:19:43.870 --> 00:19:43.880 align:start position:0%
received um if you had if you had worked
 
00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:46.840 align:start position:0%
through to the maximum retirement age um
 
00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:49.440 align:start position:0%
again I think that that just is a In
 
00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:52.640 align:start position:0%
fairness um that's that's a uh an
 
00:19:56.990 --> 00:19:57.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate U proposal um the other
 
00:19:58.549 --> 00:19:58.559 align:start position:0%
thing that it would do and I think this
 
00:20:02.029 --> 00:20:02.039 align:start position:0%
is really very important under the
 
00:20:05.190 --> 00:20:05.200 align:start position:0%
current retirement system for judges
 
00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:07.000 align:start position:0%
once the judge has
 
00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:09.760 align:start position:0%
worked a sufficient number of years so
 
00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:12.440 align:start position:0%
that he would be eligible or she would
 
00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:15.520 align:start position:0%
be eligible to receive the maximum pen
 
00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:17.240 align:start position:0%
pension benefit which is
 
00:20:20.549 --> 00:20:20.559 align:start position:0%
75% of the last year's salary the judge
 
00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
is no longer required to contribute 10%
 
00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:29.240 align:start position:0%
of his or her pay uh to the to uh his
 
00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:32.000 align:start position:0%
his or her retirement um that's that's
 
00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:34.120 align:start position:0%
been in effect since this since the
 
00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
existing judicial retirement plan came
 
00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:38.840 align:start position:0%
into being in
 
00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:42.120 align:start position:0%
2005 and I mean from you know as someone
 
00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
who who received the benefit of that
 
00:20:46.510 --> 00:20:46.520 align:start position:0%
frankly it was you know it was it it was
 
00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:48.440 align:start position:0%
good for the judge but I'm not sure In
 
00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:50.320 align:start position:0%
fairness that it really that there
 
00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:53.080 align:start position:0%
really is any reason for that provision
 
00:20:54.870 --> 00:20:54.880 align:start position:0%
to exist if you're making it so this
 
00:20:57.390 --> 00:20:57.400 align:start position:0%
changes that and basically says you make
 
00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:00.480 align:start position:0%
10% contributions until you actually
 
00:21:04.909 --> 00:21:04.919 align:start position:0%
retire um there are a few other things
 
00:21:07.710 --> 00:21:07.720 align:start position:0%
um uh in this that are explained in the
 
00:21:09.950 --> 00:21:09.960 align:start position:0%
memo and I know I'm I don't I know there
 
00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:11.200 align:start position:0%
are other people who are interested in
 
00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:13.080 align:start position:0%
speaking and and I want to make sure
 
00:21:15.870 --> 00:21:15.880 align:start position:0%
that I'm I'm not sort of hogging their
 
00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
time so I think that um that is sort of
 
00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:23.320 align:start position:0%
the essence of what is proposed here um
 
00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:26.720 align:start position:0%
I think um the one of in in addition to
 
00:21:29.269 --> 00:21:29.279 align:start position:0%
the sort of financial issues that are
 
00:21:32.590 --> 00:21:32.600 align:start position:0%
that are ex extent here um I think
 
00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:36.400 align:start position:0%
another thing just frankly in in in in
 
00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:40.240 align:start position:0%
all cander we have to say is that for
 
00:21:44.190 --> 00:21:44.200 align:start position:0%
the the current plan particularly for a
 
00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:46.320 align:start position:0%
shortterm judge in other words a judge
 
00:21:50.590 --> 00:21:50.600 align:start position:0%
who serves let's say 10 years is really
 
00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
a very very generous plan um it it
 
00:21:56.990 --> 00:21:57.000 align:start position:0%
essentially says that a judge that
 
00:21:58.630 --> 00:21:58.640 align:start position:0%
serves 10 years can can receive a
 
00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:01.200 align:start position:0%
pension of 75% of his his or her last
 
00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:04.960 align:start position:0%
year's salary that effectively it seems
 
00:22:07.070 --> 00:22:07.080 align:start position:0%
to me is the pension that most people in
 
00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:09.240 align:start position:0%
fact it's probably more than the pension
 
00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:11.320 align:start position:0%
that most people would see receive for a
 
00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:14.960 align:start position:0%
lifetime of work and so this plan
 
00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:17.440 align:start position:0%
essentially says this this proposed
 
00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:21.080 align:start position:0%
change look if you serve 10 years as a
 
00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
judge then you should get a reasonable
 
00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:26.840 align:start position:0%
pension um which under this proposal
 
00:22:29.669 --> 00:22:29.679 align:start position:0%
would be 40% of this of your last year
 
00:22:32.510 --> 00:22:32.520 align:start position:0%
salary but you know for example let's
 
00:22:34.029 --> 00:22:34.039 align:start position:0%
suppose you become a judge at 60 and
 
00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:35.840 align:start position:0%
leave at 70 well that means you've
 
00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:37.720 align:start position:0%
become a judge at the you know sort of
 
00:22:40.789 --> 00:22:40.799 align:start position:0%
at the tail end of your working career
 
00:22:43.789 --> 00:22:43.799 align:start position:0%
and what this says is okay we will give
 
00:22:46.750 --> 00:22:46.760 align:start position:0%
you a fair pension for that service that
 
00:22:48.750 --> 00:22:48.760 align:start position:0%
you performed to the state very valuable
 
00:22:51.149 --> 00:22:51.159 align:start position:0%
service for the last 10 years of your
 
00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:54.480 align:start position:0%
working life but for the earlier part
 
00:22:57.990 --> 00:22:58.000 align:start position:0%
the earlier 40 years or 35 or 45 years
 
00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:00.360 align:start position:0%
years of your working life it really was
 
00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:01.390 align:start position:0%
years of your working life it really was
your

00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:01.400 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:05.080 align:start position:0%
responsibility to to you know provide
 
00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:07.200 align:start position:0%
for your pension for that portion of
 
00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:10.640 align:start position:0%
your working life and it shouldn't be
 
00:23:12.750 --> 00:23:12.760 align:start position:0%
the state's responsibility just because
 
00:23:15.149 --> 00:23:15.159 align:start position:0%
you're a judge to sort of give you the
 
00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:18.240 align:start position:0%
full pension for for 10 years of of
 
00:23:21.149 --> 00:23:21.159 align:start position:0%
service and as I I happen to just speak
 
00:23:23.909 --> 00:23:23.919 align:start position:0%
with uh representative Gordon um over
 
00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:26.840 align:start position:0%
the weekend you know if you compare if
 
00:23:28.549 --> 00:23:28.559 align:start position:0%
you compare
 
00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:31.760 align:start position:0%
the judge's pension plan to a regular
 
00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:34.240 align:start position:0%
state employees pension plan for you
 
00:23:36.149 --> 00:23:36.159 align:start position:0%
know a regular state employee who serves
 
00:23:38.549 --> 00:23:38.559 align:start position:0%
even at a high level in state government
 
00:23:41.669 --> 00:23:41.679 align:start position:0%
who serves 30 years uh receives a
 
00:23:44.789 --> 00:23:44.799 align:start position:0%
pension that's far less than than what a
 
00:23:46.269 --> 00:23:46.279 align:start position:0%
judge would receive for 10 years of
 
00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:48.720 align:start position:0%
service under the current plan under the
 
00:23:51.070 --> 00:23:51.080 align:start position:0%
existing judicial retirement plan so I
 
00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:54.240 align:start position:0%
think for all those reasons this this
 
00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
plan makes sense as I said I want to
 
00:23:58.470 --> 00:23:58.480 align:start position:0%
emphasize that
 
00:24:01.029 --> 00:24:01.039 align:start position:0%
um I am I completely I I believe Mr head
 
00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
is going to indicate that the judicial
 
00:24:06.269 --> 00:24:06.279 align:start position:0%
branch wants to provide more information
 
00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:09.440 align:start position:0%
and would need some some time to do that
 
00:24:11.110 --> 00:24:11.120 align:start position:0%
um and I completely agree with that I
 
00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:13.360 align:start position:0%
think we I think we I absolutely think
 
00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:14.720 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure that we get this
 
00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:16.320 align:start position:0%
right and if there's some you know
 
00:24:18.269 --> 00:24:18.279 align:start position:0%
additional information that seagull can
 
00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:21.960 align:start position:0%
provide um I I I hope the committee will
 
00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:25.080 align:start position:0%
you know will will allow um that to
 
00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:28.320 align:start position:0%
happen so with that I I I'll shut up and
 
00:24:29.909 --> 00:24:29.919 align:start position:0%

00:24:55.870 --> 00:24:55.880 align:start position:0%
directly it only affects perspective

representative
 
00:25:38.669 --> 00:25:38.679 align:start position:0%

00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:41.360 align:start position:0%
one's to the chair am I assuming that
 
00:25:43.549 --> 00:25:43.559 align:start position:0%
this will go to another committee that
 
00:25:47.310 --> 00:25:47.320 align:start position:0%
will look more into the uh the financial
 
00:25:50.549 --> 00:25:50.559 align:start position:0%
aspects of it because I'm an H&amp;R Block
 
00:25:52.909 --> 00:25:52.919 align:start position:0%
kind of guy this will go to a second
 
00:25:55.269 --> 00:25:55.279 align:start position:0%
committee that's why we're hearing the
 
00:25:58.950 --> 00:25:58.960 align:start position:0%
bill okay thank you and and to uh
 
00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:01.840 align:start position:0%

it's a pleasure to see you here and it's
 
00:26:06.630 --> 00:26:06.640 align:start position:0%
a pleasure to work with you in any
 
00:26:09.789 --> 00:26:09.799 align:start position:0%
context a very brief question does this
 
00:26:13.710 --> 00:26:13.720 align:start position:0%
bill as opposed to cacr 6 doeses this
 
00:26:17.430 --> 00:26:17.440 align:start position:0%
Bill affect the retire mandatory
 
00:26:21.789 --> 00:26:21.799 align:start position:0%
retirement age of Judges just in the in
 
00:26:21.799 --> 00:26:23.070 align:start position:0%
retirement age of Judges just in the in
this

00:26:23.070 --> 00:26:23.080 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:26:25.870 --> 00:26:25.880 align:start position:0%
bill you know thank you very much
 
00:26:28.149 --> 00:26:28.159 align:start position:0%
representative buron I I want to say I I
 
00:26:30.990 --> 00:26:31.000 align:start position:0%
I feel the same way about this I uh I
 
00:26:32.389 --> 00:26:32.399 align:start position:0%
very much enjoyed working with you when
 
00:26:34.110 --> 00:26:34.120 align:start position:0%
you're on this supreme court rules
 
00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
committee and I'm delighted to be able
 
00:26:36.990 --> 00:26:37.000 align:start position:0%
to have the opportunity to work with you
 
00:26:39.789 --> 00:26:39.799 align:start position:0%
again in the legislature um I I think
 
00:26:43.430 --> 00:26:43.440 align:start position:0%
that it it doesn't change in any way the
 
00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
the age 70 limitation that all judges
 
00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
must retire at age 70 that would require
 
00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:49.600 align:start position:0%
the Constitutional Amendment which will
 
00:26:52.350 --> 00:26:52.360 align:start position:0%
be the subject of the next um hearing
 
00:26:55.909 --> 00:26:55.919 align:start position:0%
but it does it does raise the retirement
 
00:26:59.669 --> 00:26:59.679 align:start position:0%
age um as I as I said right right now a
 
00:27:01.710 --> 00:27:01.720 align:start position:0%
judge with 15 years of service can
 
00:27:04.430 --> 00:27:04.440 align:start position:0%
retire at age 60 this would raise that
 
00:27:09.909 --> 00:27:09.919 align:start position:0%
to 62 and it also raises the from 65 to
 
00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:13.440 align:start position:0%
67 the um the
 
00:27:16.990 --> 00:27:17.000 align:start position:0%
uh age the minimum age that a judge can
 
00:27:21.389 --> 00:27:21.399 align:start position:0%
retire with 10 years of service thank
 
00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:29.430 align:start position:0%
 
question

00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:29.440 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:27:31.710 --> 00:27:31.720 align:start position:0%
Mr chair would it be possible for you to
 
00:27:34.310 --> 00:27:34.320 align:start position:0%
unmute your computer that you're on or
 
00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:36.080 align:start position:0%
does that give too much feedback with
 
00:27:38.870 --> 00:27:38.880 align:start position:0%
the room because of the
 
00:27:41.389 --> 00:27:41.399 align:start position:0%
feedback but I can try to speak a little
 
00:27:43.950 --> 00:27:43.960 align:start position:0%
louder that would be helpful that'd be
 
00:27:48.310 --> 00:27:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:53.350 --> 00:27:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:58.230 --> 00:27:58.240 align:start position:0%
MC thank you Mr chairman um and I too am
 
00:27:59.870 --> 00:27:59.880 align:start position:0%
having trouble hearing you it's more
 
00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
garbled as opposed to um the the volume
 
00:28:07.750 --> 00:28:07.760 align:start position:0%
but um thank you um I wanted to ask uh
 
00:28:09.909 --> 00:28:09.919 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn the question if it's
 
00:28:12.990 --> 00:28:13.000 align:start position:0%
been considered that um in making these
 
00:28:16.909 --> 00:28:16.919 align:start position:0%
changes that uh some um members of the
 
00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:18.480 align:start position:0%
bar that are going to be appointed to
 
00:28:21.470 --> 00:28:21.480 align:start position:0%
the Judiciary um would be making less in
 
00:28:25.389 --> 00:28:25.399 align:start position:0%
those last few years of their um um
 
00:28:27.070 --> 00:28:27.080 align:start position:0%
career than they would have in private
 
00:28:28.590 --> 00:28:28.600 align:start position:0%
practice and that this might be a
 
00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:32.320 align:start position:0%
disincentive for um some people to um
 
00:28:34.909 --> 00:28:34.919 align:start position:0%
that are you know very qualified to join
 
00:28:38.350 --> 00:28:38.360 align:start position:0%
the bar to join the Judiciary thank you
 
00:28:39.630 --> 00:28:39.640 align:start position:0%
well you know no that's that's a very
 
00:28:40.909 --> 00:28:40.919 align:start position:0%
good point and it's something that I
 
00:28:43.549 --> 00:28:43.559 align:start position:0%
think that you know we we we rightly
 
00:28:47.149 --> 00:28:47.159 align:start position:0%
need to be concerned about um I guess
 
00:28:49.269 --> 00:28:49.279 align:start position:0%
what I what I would say this is my take
 
00:28:52.269 --> 00:28:52.279 align:start position:0%
and I you know I have I I understand
 
00:28:53.870 --> 00:28:53.880 align:start position:0%
that other people might have a different
 
00:28:58.029 --> 00:28:58.039 align:start position:0%
view on this it my take on this is is
 
00:29:01.630 --> 00:29:01.640 align:start position:0%
this right now what the the judicial
 
00:29:05.070 --> 00:29:05.080 align:start position:0%
retirement plan is a very generous plan
 
00:29:06.590 --> 00:29:06.600 align:start position:0%
I mean I I think we have to really be
 
00:29:08.950 --> 00:29:08.960 align:start position:0%
honest about that it's a very generous
 
00:29:13.470 --> 00:29:13.480 align:start position:0%
plan um for judges this will change that
 
00:29:16.710 --> 00:29:16.720 align:start position:0%
from a very generous plan to a generous
 
00:29:19.509 --> 00:29:19.519 align:start position:0%
plan in other words if under under this
 
00:29:22.830 --> 00:29:22.840 align:start position:0%
um under this uh proposal for example
 
00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:26.640 align:start position:0%
you right now you can attain a 70 75%
 
00:29:29.750 --> 00:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
pension with 10 years of service under
 
00:29:31.549 --> 00:29:31.559 align:start position:0%
this proposal you would have I believe
 
00:29:34.149 --> 00:29:34.159 align:start position:0%
it's about 18 and a half years of
 
00:29:37.630 --> 00:29:37.640 align:start position:0%
service that you would have to attain to
 
00:29:41.430 --> 00:29:41.440 align:start position:0%
uh to get a 75% pension um but I think
 
00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:44.240 align:start position:0%
it's it it's it's important to
 
00:29:46.669 --> 00:29:46.679 align:start position:0%
understand that this still is a defined
 
00:29:49.950 --> 00:29:49.960 align:start position:0%
benefit plan lawyers in private practice
 
00:29:52.950 --> 00:29:52.960 align:start position:0%
even in big firms making a lot of money
 
00:29:55.870 --> 00:29:55.880 align:start position:0%
um it's I would think it it is very rare
 
00:29:58.350 --> 00:29:58.360 align:start position:0%
if if if it exists at all to have a
 
00:30:01.509 --> 00:30:01.519 align:start position:0%
defined benefit pension plan I mean I
 
00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
think that really is a pretty
 
00:30:07.070 --> 00:30:07.080 align:start position:0%
valuable um pretty valuable asset for a
 
00:30:10.470 --> 00:30:10.480 align:start position:0%
judge to have um and as I said you know
 
00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:13.440 align:start position:0%
I think it's true that some some judges
 
00:30:14.990 --> 00:30:15.000 align:start position:0%
uh some people who become judges
 
00:30:18.190 --> 00:30:18.200 align:start position:0%
unquestionably take a a pay cut um if
 
00:30:19.909 --> 00:30:19.919 align:start position:0%
they've been in private practice you
 
00:30:23.509 --> 00:30:23.519 align:start position:0%
know um unquestionably they do but I
 
00:30:23.519 --> 00:30:24.909 align:start position:0%
know um unquestionably they do but I
think

00:30:24.909 --> 00:30:24.919 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:27.720 align:start position:0%
that I I suspect that most people who
 
00:30:29.870 --> 00:30:29.880 align:start position:0%
become judges think that there are other
 
00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:32.640 align:start position:0%
benefits to becoming a judge
 
00:30:35.029 --> 00:30:35.039 align:start position:0%
particularly the you know the quality of
 
00:30:37.789 --> 00:30:37.799 align:start position:0%
the work it it is really from my
 
00:30:39.870 --> 00:30:39.880 align:start position:0%
perspective you know maybe I'm biased
 
00:30:42.269 --> 00:30:42.279 align:start position:0%
because I did it for so long but it
 
00:30:45.909 --> 00:30:45.919 align:start position:0%
really is tremendously worthwhile work
 
00:30:48.870 --> 00:30:48.880 align:start position:0%
very rewarding I think having been in
 
00:30:50.830 --> 00:30:50.840 align:start position:0%
private practice for a while I can say
 
00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:53.360 align:start position:0%
you know it it is much more rewarding
 
00:30:56.750 --> 00:30:56.760 align:start position:0%
than I found Private Practice to be um
 
00:30:59.590 --> 00:30:59.600 align:start position:0%
putting aide the financial aspects of it
 
00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:03.200 align:start position:0%
and so I think um my own sense is that
 
00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:05.360 align:start position:0%
there that that there is not a
 
00:31:08.590 --> 00:31:08.600 align:start position:0%
significant risk of reducing the quality
 
00:31:11.190 --> 00:31:11.200 align:start position:0%
of judicial
 
00:31:16.909 --> 00:31:16.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:22.149 --> 00:31:22.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:25.200 align:start position:0%
Horan have to unmute thank you oh thank
 
00:31:26.710 --> 00:31:26.720 align:start position:0%
you very much Mr chair thank you much
 
00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:29.360 align:start position:0%
representative lnn um your your
 
00:31:31.509 --> 00:31:31.519 align:start position:0%
successor was appointed a few days ago
 
00:31:33.870 --> 00:31:33.880 align:start position:0%
and he had um in his case just a few
 
00:31:36.750 --> 00:31:36.760 align:start position:0%
years of service um with the depart with
 
00:31:38.470 --> 00:31:38.480 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's office he
 
00:31:40.789 --> 00:31:40.799 align:start position:0%
actually was the Attorney General so if
 
00:31:44.190 --> 00:31:44.200 align:start position:0%
somebody has been a state employee in
 
00:31:47.070 --> 00:31:47.080 align:start position:0%
the uh executive branch or have even the
 
00:31:51.310 --> 00:31:51.320 align:start position:0%
legislative branch um are there benefits
 
00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:52.720 align:start position:0%
from that affected by the fact that
 
00:31:55.669 --> 00:31:55.679 align:start position:0%
they're also participating in this plan
 
00:31:58.549 --> 00:31:58.559 align:start position:0%
or or is that not make or does it make
 
00:31:59.750 --> 00:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
no difference what it was they were
 
00:32:02.710 --> 00:32:02.720 align:start position:0%
doing before they became a a judge now
 
00:32:05.389 --> 00:32:05.399 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that the plans and
 
00:32:08.110 --> 00:32:08.120 align:start position:0%
again I I I I stand to be corrected on
 
00:32:09.710 --> 00:32:09.720 align:start position:0%
this by Mr head if I'm wrong but I don't
 
00:32:12.789 --> 00:32:12.799 align:start position:0%
think I am I think that these are really
 
00:32:16.190 --> 00:32:16.200 align:start position:0%
completely separate plans so that if you
 
00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:19.240 align:start position:0%
um if if for example someone were were
 
00:32:22.430 --> 00:32:22.440 align:start position:0%
was a regular state employee and was to
 
00:32:25.190 --> 00:32:25.200 align:start position:0%
qualify for a pension they could they
 
00:32:27.750 --> 00:32:27.760 align:start position:0%
could get their pension and if they then
 
00:32:29.509 --> 00:32:29.519 align:start position:0%
became a judge and then qualified for a
 
00:32:30.870 --> 00:32:30.880 align:start position:0%
Judicial pension they could get their
 
00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
judicial pension I think that's right um
 
00:32:36.190 --> 00:32:36.200 align:start position:0%
representative Gordon if I'm if I'm
 
00:32:38.029 --> 00:32:38.039 align:start position:0%
wrong on that please correct me but I
 
00:32:40.350 --> 00:32:40.360 align:start position:0%
think that's
 
00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:49.310 --> 00:32:49.320 align:start position:0%
thanks if there are no more questions uh
 
00:32:50.830 --> 00:32:50.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony represent
 
00:32:53.629 --> 00:32:53.639 align:start position:0%

00:32:58.190 --> 00:32:58.200 align:start position:0%
Lorenzo
 
00:33:00.990 --> 00:33:01.000 align:start position:0%
lenzo uh representative Lynn I have a
 
00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:02.149 align:start position:0%
lenzo uh representative Lynn I have a
question

00:33:02.149 --> 00:33:02.159 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:33:06.310 --> 00:33:06.320 align:start position:0%
and talking about the very generous plan
 
00:33:08.710 --> 00:33:08.720 align:start position:0%
has is there any option of changing from
 
00:33:11.389 --> 00:33:11.399 align:start position:0%
a defined benefit plan to a defined
 
00:33:14.590 --> 00:33:14.600 align:start position:0%
contribution plan or is that totally you
 
00:33:16.350 --> 00:33:16.360 align:start position:0%
know not an
 
00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:19.440 align:start position:0%
option thank you no you know you that
 
00:33:21.070 --> 00:33:21.080 align:start position:0%
that's an excellent question
 
00:33:24.669 --> 00:33:24.679 align:start position:0%
representative D Lorenzo um you know
 
00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
I going forward this is I'm expressing
 
00:33:30.870 --> 00:33:30.880 align:start position:0%
purely my my this is my personal opinion
 
00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:36.960 align:start position:0%
here going forward I think for both the
 
00:33:39.509 --> 00:33:39.519 align:start position:0%
judicial retirement plan and for the
 
00:33:42.590 --> 00:33:42.600 align:start position:0%
state employees you know retirement plan
 
00:33:46.470 --> 00:33:46.480 align:start position:0%
generally I think it would make a lot of
 
00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
sense for new employees to change from a
 
00:33:52.669 --> 00:33:52.679 align:start position:0%
defined benefit to a defined
 
00:33:56.430 --> 00:33:56.440 align:start position:0%
contribution plan but my understanding
 
00:33:58.230 --> 00:33:58.240 align:start position:0%
on that and I'm not I don't profess to
 
00:34:00.310 --> 00:34:00.320 align:start position:0%
be a financial expert in any way my
 
00:34:01.870 --> 00:34:01.880 align:start position:0%
understanding on that is that in order
 
00:34:06.710 --> 00:34:06.720 align:start position:0%
to do that it would take a huge Capital
 
00:34:10.030 --> 00:34:10.040 align:start position:0%
contribution by the state
 
00:34:16.430 --> 00:34:16.440 align:start position:0%
to to make up for the loss in
 
00:34:20.109 --> 00:34:20.119 align:start position:0%
contributions of new employees to the
 
00:34:23.230 --> 00:34:23.240 align:start position:0%
people who were you know who who are
 
00:34:26.310 --> 00:34:26.320 align:start position:0%
existing employees um and I uh so I mean
 
00:34:27.669 --> 00:34:27.679 align:start position:0%
unless you
 
00:34:29.310 --> 00:34:29.320 align:start position:0%
unless you were going to try to make
 
00:34:31.669 --> 00:34:31.679 align:start position:0%
this retroactive and I think that could
 
00:34:34.389 --> 00:34:34.399 align:start position:0%
really you know there would be some real
 
00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:36.560 align:start position:0%
significant fairness questions for
 
00:34:38.990 --> 00:34:39.000 align:start position:0%
people um who are who are under the
 
00:34:41.470 --> 00:34:41.480 align:start position:0%
existing plan so I think that in fact it
 
00:34:43.109 --> 00:34:43.119 align:start position:0%
could even be some constitutional issues
 
00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
on that but but I think uh um although I
 
00:34:48.829 --> 00:34:48.839 align:start position:0%
think it would be a great idea to do it
 
00:34:54.790 --> 00:34:54.800 align:start position:0%
for perspective future employees um I I
 
00:34:56.310 --> 00:34:56.320 align:start position:0%
I I think that there are some huge
 
00:34:58.190 --> 00:34:58.200 align:start position:0%
hurdles that you know it would require a
 
00:35:01.829 --> 00:35:01.839 align:start position:0%
really real care really careful um uh
 
00:35:04.910 --> 00:35:04.920 align:start position:0%
economic study by some experts and I
 
00:35:07.910 --> 00:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
think that the bottom line might end up
 
00:35:09.750 --> 00:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
being that that it would cost so much
 
00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
money such a capital contribution to do
 
00:35:15.750 --> 00:35:15.760 align:start position:0%
that that it it would be hard to
 
00:35:22.510 --> 00:35:22.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:25.990 --> 00:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
you I don't see any more hands being the
 
00:35:28.510 --> 00:35:28.520 align:start position:0%
case thank you
 
00:35:36.790 --> 00:35:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:39.550 --> 00:35:39.560 align:start position:0%
Richard um thank you Mr chairman um
 
00:35:40.950 --> 00:35:40.960 align:start position:0%
thank you members of the committee my
 
00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:43.440 align:start position:0%
name is Richard headed I am the
 
00:35:45.470 --> 00:35:45.480 align:start position:0%
legislative affairs coordinator for the
 
00:35:47.790 --> 00:35:47.800 align:start position:0%
judicial branch um thank you for giving
 
00:35:50.510 --> 00:35:50.520 align:start position:0%
me the opportunity to talk today as
 
00:35:53.309 --> 00:35:53.319 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn uh mentioned in in
 
00:35:56.150 --> 00:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
his testimony um the judicial branch has
 
00:35:59.390 --> 00:35:59.400 align:start position:0%
retained the seagull group um to help us
 
00:36:03.109 --> 00:36:03.119 align:start position:0%
do some uh both evaluating The Proposal
 
00:36:05.630 --> 00:36:05.640 align:start position:0%
that's in representative Lynn's bill but
 
00:36:10.150 --> 00:36:10.160 align:start position:0%
also to evaluate other um scenarios that
 
00:36:11.150 --> 00:36:11.160 align:start position:0%
we would like to bring to the
 
00:36:13.550 --> 00:36:13.560 align:start position:0%
committee's attention as as seagull
 
00:36:16.430 --> 00:36:16.440 align:start position:0%
performs its work um we met with them
 
00:36:18.870 --> 00:36:18.880 align:start position:0%
yesterday uh and ran through some
 
00:36:20.990 --> 00:36:21.000 align:start position:0%
scenarios and they're going to put
 
00:36:23.750 --> 00:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
together um a plan going forward but it
 
00:36:26.030 --> 00:36:26.040 align:start position:0%
will as representative Lynn suggested
 
00:36:29.390 --> 00:36:29.400 align:start position:0%
take us some time time um we do not I'm
 
00:36:31.150 --> 00:36:31.160 align:start position:0%
I'm here to testify for information not
 
00:36:33.589 --> 00:36:33.599 align:start position:0%
to take a position on the bill but at
 
00:36:36.550 --> 00:36:36.560 align:start position:0%
the end of my um my testimony I am going
 
00:36:39.309 --> 00:36:39.319 align:start position:0%
to ask if this bill could be retained in
 
00:36:41.589 --> 00:36:41.599 align:start position:0%
this committee and the reason why we
 
00:36:42.870 --> 00:36:42.880 align:start position:0%
think it should be retained in this
 
00:36:44.349 --> 00:36:44.359 align:start position:0%
committee as opposed to going to the
 
00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
second uh committee over in finance um
 
00:36:50.270 --> 00:36:50.280 align:start position:0%
and be retained there is there are some
 
00:36:52.349 --> 00:36:52.359 align:start position:0%
significant policy implications
 
00:36:56.030 --> 00:36:56.040 align:start position:0%
associated with um whatever retirement
 
00:36:59.069 --> 00:36:59.079 align:start position:0%
plan is developed in this committee you
 
00:37:01.910 --> 00:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
know the the changes and tweaks that you
 
00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:03.520 align:start position:0%
make to the retirement system the
 
00:37:06.670 --> 00:37:06.680 align:start position:0%
judicial retirement system will impact
 
00:37:10.589 --> 00:37:10.599 align:start position:0%
the type of candidates we have for the
 
00:37:14.470 --> 00:37:14.480 align:start position:0%
Judiciary going forward the tweaks um
 
00:37:16.950 --> 00:37:16.960 align:start position:0%
Can impact for example whether or not
 
00:37:19.710 --> 00:37:19.720 align:start position:0%
it's more attractive to a younger lawyer
 
00:37:22.829 --> 00:37:22.839 align:start position:0%
or an older lawyer and as a policy
 
00:37:25.309 --> 00:37:25.319 align:start position:0%
matter do you want to see more
 
00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
experienced older lawy ERS coming in and
 
00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:30.160 align:start position:0%
joining the Judiciary or do you want
 
00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:33.520 align:start position:0%
younger ones it also impacts whether or
 
00:37:38.190 --> 00:37:38.200 align:start position:0%
not um you drawing um potential judges
 
00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:41.200 align:start position:0%
from the public sector whether it be uh
 
00:37:42.910 --> 00:37:42.920 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's office from
 
00:37:45.829 --> 00:37:45.839 align:start position:0%
public defenders from county attorney's
 
00:37:49.270 --> 00:37:49.280 align:start position:0%
offices and whether or not um the
 
00:37:52.630 --> 00:37:52.640 align:start position:0%
retirement system is beneficial to them
 
00:37:55.109 --> 00:37:55.119 align:start position:0%
or potentially could be a financial
 
00:37:57.710 --> 00:37:57.720 align:start position:0%
detriment to them um we had talked
 
00:38:00.630 --> 00:38:00.640 align:start position:0%
earlier about in in the discussion with
 
00:38:03.790 --> 00:38:03.800 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn those employees that
 
00:38:06.750 --> 00:38:06.760 align:start position:0%
are currently in the uh State retirement
 
00:38:10.190 --> 00:38:10.200 align:start position:0%
uh plan for example if those those
 
00:38:12.990 --> 00:38:13.000 align:start position:0%
employees are in for nine years and and
 
00:38:15.390 --> 00:38:15.400 align:start position:0%
moov to the Judiciary they've not yet
 
00:38:17.550 --> 00:38:17.560 align:start position:0%
vested in the in the state retirement
 
00:38:20.150 --> 00:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
system so those folks would not be
 
00:38:22.190 --> 00:38:22.200 align:start position:0%
eligible for a pension out of the state
 
00:38:24.109 --> 00:38:24.119 align:start position:0%
retirement system unlike if they had
 
00:38:27.950 --> 00:38:27.960 align:start position:0%
gotten past 10 years uh so you know you
 
00:38:31.309 --> 00:38:31.319 align:start position:0%
may be attracting a different type of
 
00:38:34.309 --> 00:38:34.319 align:start position:0%
candidate for judicial nomination based
 
00:38:37.190 --> 00:38:37.200 align:start position:0%
upon what the retirement plan ultimately
 
00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:38.030 align:start position:0%
upon what the retirement plan ultimately
uh

00:38:38.030 --> 00:38:38.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:38:39.990 --> 00:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
provides one of the other things I
 
00:38:42.950 --> 00:38:42.960 align:start position:0%
wanted to point out is based on the work
 
00:38:45.390 --> 00:38:45.400 align:start position:0%
that seagull did back in
 
00:38:48.670 --> 00:38:48.680 align:start position:0%
2018 this is not a savings that would
 
00:38:51.750 --> 00:38:51.760 align:start position:0%
occur immediately you have as as
 
00:38:53.430 --> 00:38:53.440 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn said this bill would
 
00:38:56.589 --> 00:38:56.599 align:start position:0%
apply to new judges so you still have
 
00:38:59.109 --> 00:38:59.119 align:start position:0%
have the current cost structure that
 
00:39:01.950 --> 00:39:01.960 align:start position:0%
would be in existence moving forward and
 
00:39:04.030 --> 00:39:04.040 align:start position:0%
really you're not going to see savings
 
00:39:07.390 --> 00:39:07.400 align:start position:0%
out of this proposal for really quite
 
00:39:09.550 --> 00:39:09.560 align:start position:0%
some time and really the significant
 
00:39:12.230 --> 00:39:12.240 align:start position:0%
savings are not until you know 20 or 30
 
00:39:16.030 --> 00:39:16.040 align:start position:0%
years out um as as the current system
 
00:39:19.270 --> 00:39:19.280 align:start position:0%
judges um uh come out of the system and
 
00:39:22.230 --> 00:39:22.240 align:start position:0%
the newer judges are moving into it um
 
00:39:25.309 --> 00:39:25.319 align:start position:0%
so this is not a bill that is going to
 
00:39:28.309 --> 00:39:28.319 align:start position:0%
impact for example the the current Bal
 
00:39:31.829 --> 00:39:31.839 align:start position:0%
budget um this is a really a long-term
 
00:39:34.910 --> 00:39:34.920 align:start position:0%
proposal in one we think really needs to
 
00:39:37.390 --> 00:39:37.400 align:start position:0%
be considered for policy issues and
 
00:39:40.150 --> 00:39:40.160 align:start position:0%
policy considerations before it moves
 
00:39:42.510 --> 00:39:42.520 align:start position:0%
over to uh to
 
00:39:44.790 --> 00:39:44.800 align:start position:0%
finance so at the end of the day you we
 
00:39:47.270 --> 00:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
want we are asking if if this committee
 
00:39:49.230 --> 00:39:49.240 align:start position:0%
would be willing to retain this bill
 
00:39:50.950 --> 00:39:50.960 align:start position:0%
give us an opportunity to work with
 
00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
seagull take any suggestions that this
 
00:39:56.950 --> 00:39:56.960 align:start position:0%
committee may want to uh to ask and and
 
00:39:59.270 --> 00:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
and give you an opportunity to ask any
 
00:40:02.390 --> 00:40:02.400 align:start position:0%
questions um as as we're trying to
 
00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:06.240 align:start position:0%
develop a uh a retirement plan that
 
00:40:09.790 --> 00:40:09.800 align:start position:0%
works for for your ultimate goals for
 
00:40:13.030 --> 00:40:13.040 align:start position:0%
the Jud judiciaries and also makes sense
 
00:40:15.990 --> 00:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
financially um and with that I would be
 
00:40:18.630 --> 00:40:18.640 align:start position:0%
happy to take any
 
00:40:25.349 --> 00:40:25.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:25.359 --> 00:40:34.190 align:start position:0%
 
questions

00:40:34.190 --> 00:40:34.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:37.990 --> 00:40:38.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony um Mr head
 
00:40:39.829 --> 00:40:39.839 align:start position:0%
uh I have a question and this might be
 
00:40:42.550 --> 00:40:42.560 align:start position:0%
something that you know now or something
 
00:40:44.309 --> 00:40:44.319 align:start position:0%
that the seagull group could look into
 
00:40:46.829 --> 00:40:46.839 align:start position:0%
as part of the study but I was wondering
 
00:40:48.950 --> 00:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
what the um I mean you probably do know
 
00:40:51.270 --> 00:40:51.280 align:start position:0%
this but what the gender breakdown of
 
00:40:53.550 --> 00:40:53.560 align:start position:0%
Judges is right now those who are active
 
00:40:56.829 --> 00:40:56.839 align:start position:0%
and those who are retired and
 
00:41:01.589 --> 00:41:01.599 align:start position:0%
whether this um this would we'd be able
 
00:41:03.309 --> 00:41:03.319 align:start position:0%
to look at how this might affect the
 
00:41:06.030 --> 00:41:06.040 align:start position:0%
draw for women candidates whose career
 
00:41:08.510 --> 00:41:08.520 align:start position:0%
trajectories are often different than
 
00:41:11.950 --> 00:41:11.960 align:start position:0%
men's and sometimes um progress at a
 
00:41:14.030 --> 00:41:14.040 align:start position:0%
rate that's higher at the end as opposed
 
00:41:16.109 --> 00:41:16.119 align:start position:0%
to sort of in the middle of their
 
00:41:18.510 --> 00:41:18.520 align:start position:0%
careers it's it's a great question and
 
00:41:20.670 --> 00:41:20.680 align:start position:0%
and truthly I I I have a sense of it but
 
00:41:22.670 --> 00:41:22.680 align:start position:0%
I don't want to guess um off the top of
 
00:41:25.030 --> 00:41:25.040 align:start position:0%
my head there is a a good mix in the
 
00:41:26.790 --> 00:41:26.800 align:start position:0%
Judiciary and actually
 
00:41:28.829 --> 00:41:28.839 align:start position:0%
um representative Lynn may actually know
 
00:41:30.910 --> 00:41:30.920 align:start position:0%
the answer to that from his his ears as
 
00:41:34.309 --> 00:41:34.319 align:start position:0%
a CJ um I don't know but I'm happy to
 
00:41:36.190 --> 00:41:36.200 align:start position:0%
get that information and make sure I get
 
00:41:39.870 --> 00:41:39.880 align:start position:0%
the it accurately to you um and I also
 
00:41:42.910 --> 00:41:42.920 align:start position:0%
knowe that in terms of of the breakdown
 
00:41:44.390 --> 00:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
of Judges you know there's a much
 
00:41:46.589 --> 00:41:46.599 align:start position:0%
different perspective I think on
 
00:41:49.230 --> 00:41:49.240 align:start position:0%
judicial retirement if you go from the
 
00:41:50.990 --> 00:41:51.000 align:start position:0%
circuit courts to the Superior Courts to
 
00:41:53.950 --> 00:41:53.960 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court um and I think that
 
00:41:56.790 --> 00:41:56.800 align:start position:0%
breakdown is important uh and is is
 
00:41:59.069 --> 00:41:59.079 align:start position:0%
useful information so I I I agree we
 
00:42:01.790 --> 00:42:01.800 align:start position:0%
will certainly um include that in in the
 
00:42:04.349 --> 00:42:04.359 align:start position:0%
as we develop the
 
00:42:06.309 --> 00:42:06.319 align:start position:0%
analysis thank
 
00:42:06.319 --> 00:42:10.349 align:start position:0%
analysis thank
you

00:42:10.349 --> 00:42:10.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:16.430 --> 00:42:16.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:18.390 --> 00:42:18.400 align:start position:0%
response yes you know what I I just
 
00:42:21.430 --> 00:42:21.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to say um if it I I agree with Mr
 
00:42:24.589 --> 00:42:24.599 align:start position:0%
head that if it is possible to retain
 
00:42:27.950 --> 00:42:27.960 align:start position:0%
the bill at least for time in this
 
00:42:29.870 --> 00:42:29.880 align:start position:0%
committee I do agree that there are
 
00:42:32.390 --> 00:42:32.400 align:start position:0%
policy issues and I think we you know we
 
00:42:34.069 --> 00:42:34.079 align:start position:0%
to the extent that seagull may be able
 
00:42:36.190 --> 00:42:36.200 align:start position:0%
to give additional information I think
 
00:42:37.990 --> 00:42:38.000 align:start position:0%
that's something that's important to
 
00:42:39.549 --> 00:42:39.559 align:start position:0%
have the other point and I should have
 
00:42:41.349 --> 00:42:41.359 align:start position:0%
made this earlier and I I apologize for
 
00:42:43.910 --> 00:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
not the other thing that I think it it
 
00:42:47.589 --> 00:42:47.599 align:start position:0%
um is is is really important um uh and
 
00:42:49.190 --> 00:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
and I think supports what Mr head has
 
00:42:51.910 --> 00:42:51.920 align:start position:0%
asked for is is this we we do have a
 
00:42:54.190 --> 00:42:54.200 align:start position:0%
brand new Chief Justice of the super of
 
00:42:55.990 --> 00:42:56.000 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court who has who has not even
 
00:42:58.190 --> 00:42:58.200 align:start position:0%
been been sworn in yet and I think it it
 
00:43:00.710 --> 00:43:00.720 align:start position:0%
you know it would make I I have not
 
00:43:02.390 --> 00:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
discussed this with him I don't know
 
00:43:05.109 --> 00:43:05.119 align:start position:0%
that any of the me you know the current
 
00:43:06.829 --> 00:43:06.839 align:start position:0%
members of the court or Mr head has
 
00:43:08.390 --> 00:43:08.400 align:start position:0%
discussed it with him and I think In
 
00:43:10.910 --> 00:43:10.920 align:start position:0%
fairness to him it would make sense to
 
00:43:13.150 --> 00:43:13.160 align:start position:0%
have him have an opportunity to you know
 
00:43:15.390 --> 00:43:15.400 align:start position:0%
to take a look at this and give you his
 
00:43:17.309 --> 00:43:17.319 align:start position:0%
thoughts on it as the as the incoming
 
00:43:20.390 --> 00:43:20.400 align:start position:0%

00:43:23.910 --> 00:43:23.920 align:start position:0%

Tomac who is a representative who also
 
00:43:48.230 --> 00:43:48.240 align:start position:0%
indicated that uh he supported the bill
 
00:43:49.349 --> 00:43:49.359 align:start position:0%
but would not
 
00:43:53.109 --> 00:43:53.119 align:start position:0%
testify and is there anybody else who
 
00:43:55.109 --> 00:43:55.119 align:start position:0%

Bob Lynn again I'm a newly elected
 
00:44:39.630 --> 00:44:39.640 align:start position:0%
representative from Windam and the
 
00:44:42.190 --> 00:44:42.200 align:start position:0%
former Chief Justice of the uh Supreme
 
00:44:46.950 --> 00:44:46.960 align:start position:0%
Court um and I appear here um in support
 
00:44:50.710 --> 00:44:50.720 align:start position:0%
of this uh legislation which would uh
 
00:44:53.790 --> 00:44:53.800 align:start position:0%
which proposes to amend the Constitution
 
00:44:57.109 --> 00:44:57.119 align:start position:0%
to increase the retirement age for
 
00:45:00.790 --> 00:45:00.800 align:start position:0%
judges uh from 70 to
 
00:45:03.309 --> 00:45:03.319 align:start position:0%
75 um as you may
 
00:45:06.589 --> 00:45:06.599 align:start position:0%
know uh part two article 78 which
 
00:45:10.309 --> 00:45:10.319 align:start position:0%
contains the age limitation of 70 for
 
00:45:13.790 --> 00:45:13.800 align:start position:0%
judges and also for sheriffs um has been
 
00:45:16.270 --> 00:45:16.280 align:start position:0%
in the New Hampshire Constitution since
 
00:45:18.990 --> 00:45:19.000 align:start position:0%
its original adoption in
 
00:45:23.710 --> 00:45:23.720 align:start position:0%
1784 um a lot has changed since 1784
 
00:45:26.990 --> 00:45:27.000 align:start position:0%
including as particularly relevant life
 
00:45:29.309 --> 00:45:29.319 align:start position:0%
expectancy my understanding is that you
 
00:45:32.750 --> 00:45:32.760 align:start position:0%
know the life expectancy in 1784 was
 
00:45:36.190 --> 00:45:36.200 align:start position:0%
significantly below 70 so it was you
 
00:45:39.230 --> 00:45:39.240 align:start position:0%
know it wasn't much of a limitation at
 
00:45:42.950 --> 00:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
the time it was initially placed in the
 
00:45:46.790 --> 00:45:46.800 align:start position:0%
Constitution um but now things are
 
00:45:51.510 --> 00:45:51.520 align:start position:0%
considerably different um I had the the
 
00:45:54.109 --> 00:45:54.119 align:start position:0%
honor of as my first job out of law
 
00:45:56.349 --> 00:45:56.359 align:start position:0%
school of clerking for a federal judge
 
00:45:59.069 --> 00:45:59.079 align:start position:0%
in Philadelphia his name was Bill
 
00:46:02.829 --> 00:46:02.839 align:start position:0%
ditter he died last year at age
 
00:46:06.190 --> 00:46:06.200 align:start position:0%
97 he remained in senior status he
 
00:46:08.750 --> 00:46:08.760 align:start position:0%
retired but they have a a system under
 
00:46:10.470 --> 00:46:10.480 align:start position:0%
the federal court federal courts where a
 
00:46:12.950 --> 00:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
judge can REM can take senior status
 
00:46:15.109 --> 00:46:15.119 align:start position:0%
which means you basically are required
 
00:46:18.190 --> 00:46:18.200 align:start position:0%
to maintain sort of a half case load and
 
00:46:20.470 --> 00:46:20.480 align:start position:0%
uh but other than that you continue to
 
00:46:22.470 --> 00:46:22.480 align:start position:0%
uh get the benefits of of an active
 
00:46:25.270 --> 00:46:25.280 align:start position:0%
judge he remained in senior status until
 
00:46:27.829 --> 00:46:27.839 align:start position:0%
he died and I uh I would generally see
 
00:46:30.870 --> 00:46:30.880 align:start position:0%
him once or twice a year he uh when I
 
00:46:32.150 --> 00:46:32.160 align:start position:0%
would go to
 
00:46:34.910 --> 00:46:34.920 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania um And he as as he got
 
00:46:37.349 --> 00:46:37.359 align:start position:0%
older he he definitely got more frail
 
00:46:42.230 --> 00:46:42.240 align:start position:0%
physically but he was as sharp as attack
 
00:46:44.190 --> 00:46:44.200 align:start position:0%
uh until the day he died he was he was
 
00:46:47.990 --> 00:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
just a very very uh brilliant guy and
 
00:46:51.750 --> 00:46:51.760 align:start position:0%
and just a tremendous judge
 
00:46:56.069 --> 00:46:56.079 align:start position:0%
um despite that fact I I have have to
 
00:46:58.470 --> 00:46:58.480 align:start position:0%
say that I do not I would not support I
 
00:47:00.309 --> 00:47:00.319 align:start position:0%
know that there was a there's a proposal
 
00:47:02.589 --> 00:47:02.599 align:start position:0%
in the Senate that would that would
 
00:47:04.630 --> 00:47:04.640 align:start position:0%
simply amend the Constitution to remove
 
00:47:07.670 --> 00:47:07.680 align:start position:0%
the age limit completely for judges I
 
00:47:10.190 --> 00:47:10.200 align:start position:0%
have to say honestly I would not support
 
00:47:13.030 --> 00:47:13.040 align:start position:0%
that I do think that it makes sense to
 
00:47:16.349 --> 00:47:16.359 align:start position:0%
have an age limit because although judge
 
00:47:18.309 --> 00:47:18.319 align:start position:0%
ditter is is you know is is sort of the
 
00:47:23.190 --> 00:47:23.200 align:start position:0%
exception to the rule I suspect that um
 
00:47:25.309 --> 00:47:25.319 align:start position:0%
Mo many people would feel uncomfortable
 
00:47:28.710 --> 00:47:28.720 align:start position:0%
having a judge 97 years old presiding
 
00:47:31.230 --> 00:47:31.240 align:start position:0%
over um their cases and that in many
 
00:47:33.950 --> 00:47:33.960 align:start position:0%
cases that uncomfortableness would would
 
00:47:33.960 --> 00:47:34.670 align:start position:0%
cases that uncomfortableness would would
be

00:47:34.670 --> 00:47:34.680 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:47:38.430 --> 00:47:38.440 align:start position:0%
justified um this this is sort of an
 
00:47:41.990 --> 00:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
incremental proposal it may be that 75
 
00:47:44.430 --> 00:47:44.440 align:start position:0%
also is too young that maybe it should
 
00:47:47.790 --> 00:47:47.800 align:start position:0%
be 80 maybe even 85 but I think that
 
00:47:51.109 --> 00:47:51.119 align:start position:0%
this is an area where it makes sense to
 
00:47:54.870 --> 00:47:54.880 align:start position:0%
be careful to go slowly to take thing
 
00:47:56.630 --> 00:47:56.640 align:start position:0%
you know to take things in in in
 
00:47:59.589 --> 00:47:59.599 align:start position:0%
increments and I think the age 75 is a
 
00:48:04.510 --> 00:48:04.520 align:start position:0%
is a is an appropriate place to start uh
 
00:48:07.510 --> 00:48:07.520 align:start position:0%
you know the what I use as as exhibit a
 
00:48:10.230 --> 00:48:10.240 align:start position:0%
in support of this proposal is is the
 
00:48:11.349 --> 00:48:11.359 align:start position:0%
person who's probably going to be the
 
00:48:13.230 --> 00:48:13.240 align:start position:0%
next witness and that's Justice Carol
 
00:48:15.670 --> 00:48:15.680 align:start position:0%
Convoy um who retired from the Supreme
 
00:48:18.109 --> 00:48:18.119 align:start position:0%
Court at age 70 well it's got to be now
 
00:48:20.870 --> 00:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
maybe uh three and a half almost four
 
00:48:24.870 --> 00:48:24.880 align:start position:0%
years ago she was just an outstanding
 
00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:26.270 align:start position:0%
years ago she was just an outstanding
judge

00:48:26.270 --> 00:48:26.280 align:start position:0%
judge
 
00:48:29.670 --> 00:48:29.680 align:start position:0%
um uh completely capable of continuing
 
00:48:34.630 --> 00:48:34.640 align:start position:0%
to serve um then and now um and it was
 
00:48:38.309 --> 00:48:38.319 align:start position:0%
just a real tragedy that um that she was
 
00:48:40.150 --> 00:48:40.160 align:start position:0%
uh that she was forced to retire at age
 
00:48:41.950 --> 00:48:41.960 align:start position:0%
70 I think that I mean I've she's not
 
00:48:44.910 --> 00:48:44.920 align:start position:0%
the only example um judge Dugen is
 
00:48:48.270 --> 00:48:48.280 align:start position:0%
another uh one I I I hope that that I
 
00:48:51.990 --> 00:48:52.000 align:start position:0%
would fall into that category also um uh
 
00:48:53.950 --> 00:48:53.960 align:start position:0%
as someone who was qualified to continue
 
00:48:57.789 --> 00:48:57.799 align:start position:0%
serving um but but I think that you know
 
00:49:00.430 --> 00:49:00.440 align:start position:0%
the judge Convoy in particular
 
00:49:04.109 --> 00:49:04.119 align:start position:0%
demonstrates um the
 
00:49:07.390 --> 00:49:07.400 align:start position:0%
um the unwisdom if you will of having
 
00:49:11.589 --> 00:49:11.599 align:start position:0%
the the age 70 now this proposal as you
 
00:49:15.349 --> 00:49:15.359 align:start position:0%
will see and I I know uh former speaker
 
00:49:18.270 --> 00:49:18.280 align:start position:0%
Donna scitec is here and uh I had a
 
00:49:19.710 --> 00:49:19.720 align:start position:0%
conversation with her last night in
 
00:49:24.109 --> 00:49:24.119 align:start position:0%
which she um she was uh she was uh not
 
00:49:25.990 --> 00:49:26.000 align:start position:0%
in favor of one aspect of this and
 
00:49:28.829 --> 00:49:28.839 align:start position:0%
that's the aspect that
 
00:49:32.030 --> 00:49:32.040 align:start position:0%
um provides that under the current
 
00:49:35.030 --> 00:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
proposal that if a judge wants to uh ex
 
00:49:36.950 --> 00:49:36.960 align:start position:0%
extend his service be his or her service
 
00:49:40.390 --> 00:49:40.400 align:start position:0%
Beyond 70 there's a process that gives
 
00:49:43.270 --> 00:49:43.280 align:start position:0%
the governor and Council the opportunity
 
00:49:45.829 --> 00:49:45.839 align:start position:0%
to look into the judge's qualific you
 
00:49:47.589 --> 00:49:47.599 align:start position:0%
know continued qualifications to make
 
00:49:49.910 --> 00:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
sure that the judge really hasn't you
 
00:49:51.150 --> 00:49:51.160 align:start position:0%
know had
 
00:49:55.150 --> 00:49:55.160 align:start position:0%
some uh diminution in mental capacity or
 
00:49:55.160 --> 00:49:56.430 align:start position:0%
some uh diminution in mental capacity or
whatever

00:49:56.430 --> 00:49:56.440 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
00:49:59.030 --> 00:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
um and then the the governor and council
 
00:50:00.630 --> 00:50:00.640 align:start position:0%
could hold a hearing on that if they
 
00:50:04.430 --> 00:50:04.440 align:start position:0%
felt it was necessary and um they would
 
00:50:06.150 --> 00:50:06.160 align:start position:0%
have a the governor and Council would
 
00:50:09.789 --> 00:50:09.799 align:start position:0%
have a veto over the judge's request to
 
00:50:13.750 --> 00:50:13.760 align:start position:0%
extend service to age 75 but only if the
 
00:50:16.510 --> 00:50:16.520 align:start position:0%
both the governor and the majority of
 
00:50:19.789 --> 00:50:19.799 align:start position:0%
the council voted to retire the judge at
 
00:50:22.390 --> 00:50:22.400 align:start position:0%
70 would the judge have to retire in
 
00:50:24.190 --> 00:50:24.200 align:start position:0%
other words if they if there was not
 
00:50:27.589 --> 00:50:27.599 align:start position:0%
that affirm vote by V affirmative vote
 
00:50:29.829 --> 00:50:29.839 align:start position:0%
by both the governor and the council the
 
00:50:34.710 --> 00:50:34.720 align:start position:0%
judge could serve till 70 um I have to
 
00:50:36.750 --> 00:50:36.760 align:start position:0%
repres former speaker scitec said that
 
00:50:39.950 --> 00:50:39.960 align:start position:0%
she thought that was a bad idea that it
 
00:50:42.309 --> 00:50:42.319 align:start position:0%
should just be uh the the age should
 
00:50:45.630 --> 00:50:45.640 align:start position:0%
simply be extended to a to 75 and
 
00:50:47.910 --> 00:50:47.920 align:start position:0%
frankly if you know if in a perfect
 
00:50:50.190 --> 00:50:50.200 align:start position:0%
world I would agree with her I think it
 
00:50:53.109 --> 00:50:53.119 align:start position:0%
uh it probably would make sense um I put
 
00:50:54.910 --> 00:50:54.920 align:start position:0%
this in here frankly at the at the
 
00:50:56.910 --> 00:50:56.920 align:start position:0%
suggestion of your chairman
 
00:50:59.670 --> 00:50:59.680 align:start position:0%
representative Gordon who thought and I
 
00:51:00.990 --> 00:51:01.000 align:start position:0%
think he
 
00:51:05.670 --> 00:51:05.680 align:start position:0%
correctly um thought that um to the
 
00:51:08.430 --> 00:51:08.440 align:start position:0%
extent that people had some concern
 
00:51:12.309 --> 00:51:12.319 align:start position:0%
about just extending the age uh by
 
00:51:15.349 --> 00:51:15.359 align:start position:0%
having this this sort of safety valve of
 
00:51:17.109 --> 00:51:17.119 align:start position:0%
the governor and Council
 
00:51:20.430 --> 00:51:20.440 align:start position:0%
review um it would um that would
 
00:51:22.670 --> 00:51:22.680 align:start position:0%
alleviate that concern that there would
 
00:51:27.430 --> 00:51:27.440 align:start position:0%
be some review um and I I you know I I
 
00:51:29.390 --> 00:51:29.400 align:start position:0%
agreed with representative Gordon that
 
00:51:32.589 --> 00:51:32.599 align:start position:0%
that that probably for lack of a better
 
00:51:35.430 --> 00:51:35.440 align:start position:0%
term as a sort of political matter to to
 
00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:36.710 align:start position:0%
term as a sort of political matter to to
uh

00:51:36.710 --> 00:51:36.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:51:40.030 --> 00:51:40.040 align:start position:0%
to assuage any concern that people might
 
00:51:42.510 --> 00:51:42.520 align:start position:0%
have it made sense I discussed it with
 
00:51:44.190 --> 00:51:44.200 align:start position:0%
Justice Convoy who's going to testify in
 
00:51:47.470 --> 00:51:47.480 align:start position:0%
a moment she also felt it was okay but I
 
00:51:50.430 --> 00:51:50.440 align:start position:0%
you know in a perfect world I would say
 
00:51:53.069 --> 00:51:53.079 align:start position:0%
it probably for the reasons that uh
 
00:51:54.589 --> 00:51:54.599 align:start position:0%
speaker scitech is going to tell you
 
00:51:56.630 --> 00:51:56.640 align:start position:0%
about I probably would say it would be
 
00:51:58.710 --> 00:51:58.720 align:start position:0%
better not to have that but to the
 
00:52:00.829 --> 00:52:00.839 align:start position:0%
extent that that that having this sort
 
00:52:03.829 --> 00:52:03.839 align:start position:0%
of safety valve persuades some people
 
00:52:06.829 --> 00:52:06.839 align:start position:0%
who might otherwise not favor the
 
00:52:09.309 --> 00:52:09.319 align:start position:0%
extension then I think um that it's
 
00:52:11.470 --> 00:52:11.480 align:start position:0%
worth doing the other thing I should say
 
00:52:13.230 --> 00:52:13.240 align:start position:0%
I just I I should say this just so that
 
00:52:17.030 --> 00:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
there so that there's no question about
 
00:52:19.470 --> 00:52:19.480 align:start position:0%
this I should emphasize that although
 
00:52:21.630 --> 00:52:21.640 align:start position:0%
Justice Convoy and I would have much
 
00:52:24.510 --> 00:52:24.520 align:start position:0%
preferred not to retire at age 70 I have
 
00:52:27.309 --> 00:52:27.319 align:start position:0%
to emphasize that this proposal is not
 
00:52:32.750 --> 00:52:32.760 align:start position:0%
about her or me uh we are both retired
 
00:52:34.430 --> 00:52:34.440 align:start position:0%
by the time this could ever become a
 
00:52:36.109 --> 00:52:36.119 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment she would be
 
00:52:40.030 --> 00:52:40.040 align:start position:0%
over 75 and although I would not be over
 
00:52:44.230 --> 00:52:44.240 align:start position:0%
75 I'm I'm barred I now I'm now a member
 
00:52:46.870 --> 00:52:46.880 align:start position:0%
of the legislature I could never serve
 
00:52:49.789 --> 00:52:49.799 align:start position:0%
as a judge um so I you know this this is
 
00:52:54.030 --> 00:52:54.040 align:start position:0%
not about her or me it's about future
 
00:52:55.750 --> 00:52:55.760 align:start position:0%
what what happens going forward forward
 
00:52:58.990 --> 00:52:59.000 align:start position:0%
and not depriving the state of people
 
00:53:01.270 --> 00:53:01.280 align:start position:0%
who are very well qualified to continue
 
00:53:03.710 --> 00:53:03.720 align:start position:0%
serving so for all those reasons I hope
 
00:53:06.950 --> 00:53:06.960 align:start position:0%
that you will look favorably upon this
 
00:53:10.349 --> 00:53:10.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:13.470 --> 00:53:13.480 align:start position:0%
you my next speaker will call former
 
00:53:24.150 --> 00:53:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:31.349 align:start position:0%
 
House

00:53:31.349 --> 00:53:31.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:33.150 --> 00:53:33.160 align:start position:0%
okay now that I've unmuted myself can
 
00:53:34.430 --> 00:53:34.440 align:start position:0%
you hear
 
00:53:37.549 --> 00:53:37.559 align:start position:0%
me okay that's a good start uh my name
 
00:53:41.910 --> 00:53:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:45.109 --> 00:53:45.119 align:start position:0%
scitech I'm a private citizen and I
 
00:53:46.589 --> 00:53:46.599 align:start position:0%
didn't know whether to put whether I
 
00:53:48.190 --> 00:53:48.200 align:start position:0%
would support or oppose this bill so I
 
00:53:50.670 --> 00:53:50.680 align:start position:0%
put neutral and as my warm-up act
 
00:53:53.470 --> 00:53:53.480 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn has told you uh I
 
00:53:56.230 --> 00:53:56.240 align:start position:0%
support changing the age of retirement
 
00:53:58.109 --> 00:53:58.119 align:start position:0%
for judges to
 
00:54:02.349 --> 00:54:02.359 align:start position:0%
75 uh without the provision for veto by
 
00:54:04.990 --> 00:54:05.000 align:start position:0%
the executive Council and the governor
 
00:54:07.030 --> 00:54:07.040 align:start position:0%
let me give you a little bit of the the
 
00:54:08.670 --> 00:54:08.680 align:start position:0%
reason that I'm here today because I
 
00:54:11.789 --> 00:54:11.799 align:start position:0%
have a long background on this
 
00:54:14.829 --> 00:54:14.839 align:start position:0%
issue uh I former chairman of the house
 
00:54:17.270 --> 00:54:17.280 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee as uh representative
 
00:54:20.109 --> 00:54:20.119 align:start position:0%
Gordon knows uh I was during the
 
00:54:22.069 --> 00:54:22.079 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Convention I was the
 
00:54:24.069 --> 00:54:24.079 align:start position:0%
chair of the committee on judicial
 
00:54:27.069 --> 00:54:27.079 align:start position:0%
tenure so I got to look at different
 
00:54:31.589 --> 00:54:31.599 align:start position:0%
models of how and how judges are
 
00:54:34.069 --> 00:54:34.079 align:start position:0%
appointed and how long they stay and
 
00:54:36.589 --> 00:54:36.599 align:start position:0%
there are uh a variety of ways of doing
 
00:54:39.349 --> 00:54:39.359 align:start position:0%
it some states they elect their judges
 
00:54:41.190 --> 00:54:41.200 align:start position:0%
periodically I can remember being in
 
00:54:43.950 --> 00:54:43.960 align:start position:0%
Nevada and seeing Billboards elect judge
 
00:54:46.390 --> 00:54:46.400 align:start position:0%
soand so tough on crime and I was
 
00:54:48.230 --> 00:54:48.240 align:start position:0%
horrified at that because in New
 
00:54:52.309 --> 00:54:52.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we have chosen to
 
00:54:56.270 --> 00:54:56.280 align:start position:0%
insulate judges from the vagaries of
 
00:54:58.390 --> 00:54:58.400 align:start position:0%
public opinion and and to allow them to
 
00:55:01.470 --> 00:55:01.480 align:start position:0%
make a correct but unpopular
 
00:55:04.829 --> 00:55:04.839 align:start position:0%
decision at my association with judges
 
00:55:06.549 --> 00:55:06.559 align:start position:0%
uh continued after the
 
00:55:10.710 --> 00:55:10.720 align:start position:0%
concon uh I was a member of the judicial
 
00:55:14.230 --> 00:55:14.240 align:start position:0%
um conduct commission was part of the
 
00:55:16.750 --> 00:55:16.760 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court four or five
 
00:55:20.549 --> 00:55:20.559 align:start position:0%
years uh the legislature in its wisdom
 
00:55:23.589 --> 00:55:23.599 align:start position:0%
established a Judicial conduct committee
 
00:55:25.950 --> 00:55:25.960 align:start position:0%
that also existed
 
00:55:28.230 --> 00:55:28.240 align:start position:0%
um and I chaired that for four years
 
00:55:29.910 --> 00:55:29.920 align:start position:0%
until the Supreme Court said no the
 
00:55:31.510 --> 00:55:31.520 align:start position:0%
legislature can't be in charge of
 
00:55:34.950 --> 00:55:34.960 align:start position:0%
judicial conduct but during that time I
 
00:55:36.950 --> 00:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
I had a chance to associate with with a
 
00:55:40.029 --> 00:55:40.039 align:start position:0%
lot of Judges uh both active and
 
00:55:44.270 --> 00:55:44.280 align:start position:0%
retired so I I have some um connection
 
00:55:46.190 --> 00:55:46.200 align:start position:0%
with it I'm currently a member of the
 
00:55:48.710 --> 00:55:48.720 align:start position:0%
governor's judicial selection commission
 
00:55:51.309 --> 00:55:51.319 align:start position:0%
so I get a chance
 
00:55:54.109 --> 00:55:54.119 align:start position:0%
to understand why people want to become
 
00:55:54.119 --> 00:55:55.710 align:start position:0%
to understand why people want to become
judges

00:55:55.710 --> 00:55:55.720 align:start position:0%
judges
 
00:55:57.870 --> 00:55:57.880 align:start position:0%
um and it's it's pretty
 
00:56:00.910 --> 00:56:00.920 align:start position:0%
enlightening so New Hampshire has had a
 
00:56:03.750 --> 00:56:03.760 align:start position:0%
history since 1784 as representative
 
00:56:07.230 --> 00:56:07.240 align:start position:0%
Lynn said of having a judge appointed
 
00:56:10.990 --> 00:56:11.000 align:start position:0%
for a a specific time without the
 
00:56:13.789 --> 00:56:13.799 align:start position:0%
intrusion to politics this is to allow
 
00:56:15.789 --> 00:56:15.799 align:start position:0%
them to make the
 
00:56:19.230 --> 00:56:19.240 align:start position:0%
correct but unpopular
 
00:56:23.069 --> 00:56:23.079 align:start position:0%
decision the way this cacr is drafted to
 
00:56:25.670 --> 00:56:25.680 align:start position:0%
allow a veto power by governor and
 
00:56:25.680 --> 00:56:26.990 align:start position:0%
allow a veto power by governor and
councel

00:56:26.990 --> 00:56:27.000 align:start position:0%
councel
 
00:56:30.230 --> 00:56:30.240 align:start position:0%
introduces politics into the judicial
 
00:56:32.190 --> 00:56:32.200 align:start position:0%
branch which we
 
00:56:36.789 --> 00:56:36.799 align:start position:0%
have hasn't been an explicit part of the
 
00:56:40.309 --> 00:56:40.319 align:start position:0%
judicial branch uh since since the the
 
00:56:42.150 --> 00:56:42.160 align:start position:0%
our constitution was
 
00:56:45.230 --> 00:56:45.240 align:start position:0%
established consider this so a judge who
 
00:56:46.710 --> 00:56:46.720 align:start position:0%
is age
 
00:56:50.549 --> 00:56:50.559 align:start position:0%
69 has a hot potato case before him he
 
00:56:52.870 --> 00:56:52.880 align:start position:0%
wants to serve until he's
 
00:56:55.870 --> 00:56:55.880 align:start position:0%
75 so he has to make a decision on an
 
00:56:58.910 --> 00:56:58.920 align:start position:0%
issue relating to election law or
 
00:57:01.710 --> 00:57:01.720 align:start position:0%
redistricting or a high-profile murder
 
00:57:05.190 --> 00:57:05.200 align:start position:0%
case and he knows that members of the
 
00:57:07.829 --> 00:57:07.839 align:start position:0%
executive Council may have a stake in
 
00:57:11.190 --> 00:57:11.200 align:start position:0%
this and so he's has to decide for
 
00:57:13.990 --> 00:57:14.000 align:start position:0%
himself or
 
00:57:17.829 --> 00:57:17.839 align:start position:0%
herself how to interpret the
 
00:57:20.190 --> 00:57:20.200 align:start position:0%
law I would I don't think that we should
 
00:57:22.589 --> 00:57:22.599 align:start position:0%
put that pressure on a judge I think
 
00:57:24.390 --> 00:57:24.400 align:start position:0%
they should have the freedom to make the
 
00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:25.630 align:start position:0%
they should have the freedom to make the
correct

00:57:25.630 --> 00:57:25.640 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:57:29.029 --> 00:57:29.039 align:start position:0%
decision based on the laww not on public
 
00:57:33.190 --> 00:57:33.200 align:start position:0%
opinion and so I would support a cacr a
 
00:57:37.950 --> 00:57:37.960 align:start position:0%
clean one that would provide for an uh
 
00:57:41.109 --> 00:57:41.119 align:start position:0%
retirement age for judges to 75 without
 
00:57:42.470 --> 00:57:42.480 align:start position:0%
the veto
 
00:57:44.349 --> 00:57:44.359 align:start position:0%
provision and while you're in that
 
00:57:46.069 --> 00:57:46.079 align:start position:0%
paragraph I think we should do away with
 
00:57:48.710 --> 00:57:48.720 align:start position:0%
the limit on Sheriff's too sheriffs are
 
00:57:50.510 --> 00:57:50.520 align:start position:0%
elected every two years if they're not
 
00:57:52.109 --> 00:57:52.119 align:start position:0%
performing they can be voted out of
 
00:57:54.190 --> 00:57:54.200 align:start position:0%
office Sheriff's are in a different
 
00:57:56.670 --> 00:57:56.680 align:start position:0%
category than judges we've protected our
 
00:57:59.069 --> 00:57:59.079 align:start position:0%
judges from the vagaries of public
 
00:58:01.150 --> 00:58:01.160 align:start position:0%
opinion to allow them to be as impartial
 
00:58:04.870 --> 00:58:04.880 align:start position:0%
as the lot of humanity will allow and so
 
00:58:07.349 --> 00:58:07.359 align:start position:0%
I think having a a clean bill with just
 
00:58:11.069 --> 00:58:11.079 align:start position:0%
age 75 is the way to go so I would be uh
 
00:58:13.950 --> 00:58:13.960 align:start position:0%
willing to answer any questions if you
 
00:58:21.870 --> 00:58:21.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:39.029 --> 00:58:39.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:41.309 --> 00:58:41.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh representative
 
00:58:46.109 --> 00:58:46.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:52.309 --> 00:58:52.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:57.270 --> 00:58:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:01.270 --> 00:59:01.280 align:start position:0%
okay um again representative Israel
 
00:59:03.710 --> 00:59:03.720 align:start position:0%
Pedra I represent Manchester Ward I
 
00:59:06.390 --> 00:59:06.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for allowing me um some time
 
00:59:09.470 --> 00:59:09.480 align:start position:0%
here so I I just wanted to say a few
 
00:59:12.750 --> 00:59:12.760 align:start position:0%
words um I'm I'm an attorney as well as
 
00:59:16.670 --> 00:59:16.680 align:start position:0%
my post in the legislature and
 
00:59:20.630 --> 00:59:20.640 align:start position:0%
um I I'm more neutral on this proposal
 
00:59:22.150 --> 00:59:22.160 align:start position:0%
than anything but I just wanted to point
 
00:59:24.230 --> 00:59:24.240 align:start position:0%
out a couple things that perhaps other
 
00:59:24.240 --> 00:59:25.190 align:start position:0%
out a couple things that perhaps other
speakers

00:59:25.190 --> 00:59:25.200 align:start position:0%
speakers
 
00:59:28.630 --> 00:59:28.640 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be touching on um you know I I
 
00:59:30.950 --> 00:59:30.960 align:start position:0%
appeared before chief justice Lynn and
 
00:59:32.670 --> 00:59:32.680 align:start position:0%
and Justice Convoy when they were on the
 
00:59:35.190 --> 00:59:35.200 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court I was a great honor to do
 
00:59:38.430 --> 00:59:38.440 align:start position:0%
so I think they're both um excellent
 
00:59:40.990 --> 00:59:41.000 align:start position:0%
jurists uh and I think if they were
 
00:59:42.789 --> 00:59:42.799 align:start position:0%
still on the bench they would still be
 
00:59:46.510 --> 00:59:46.520 align:start position:0%
excellent judges um that's only one part
 
00:59:49.630 --> 00:59:49.640 align:start position:0%
of the equation in my mind that I don't
 
00:59:52.109 --> 00:59:52.119 align:start position:0%
disagree at all with Justice chief
 
00:59:55.470 --> 00:59:55.480 align:start position:0%
justice Lynn representative Lynn about
 
00:59:57.589 --> 00:59:57.599 align:start position:0%
um and that's why I'm I consider myself
 
00:59:59.910 --> 00:59:59.920 align:start position:0%
neutral on this bill I agree that judges
 
01:00:02.510 --> 01:00:02.520 align:start position:0%
can continue to do a great job even at
 
01:00:04.870 --> 01:00:04.880 align:start position:0%
age 75 so I don't think that there would
 
01:00:06.630 --> 01:00:06.640 align:start position:0%
be any great harm caused by this
 
01:00:08.829 --> 01:00:08.839 align:start position:0%
proposal but at the same time I don't
 
01:00:10.309 --> 01:00:10.319 align:start position:0%
think it's necessary and it could have
 
01:00:12.270 --> 01:00:12.280 align:start position:0%
some negative ramifications and those
 
01:00:14.029 --> 01:00:14.039 align:start position:0%
are those are what I wanted to talk
 
01:00:17.190 --> 01:00:17.200 align:start position:0%
about um I think it's clear that
 
01:00:19.309 --> 01:00:19.319 align:start position:0%
competence is not the only reason we
 
01:00:22.069 --> 01:00:22.079 align:start position:0%
have a mandatory retirement age
 
01:00:25.150 --> 01:00:25.160 align:start position:0%
otherwise we would say let's let judges
 
01:00:26.990 --> 01:00:27.000 align:start position:0%
serve for life and have compet
 
01:00:28.870 --> 01:00:28.880 align:start position:0%
competency tests every other year once
 
01:00:31.150 --> 01:00:31.160 align:start position:0%
they they reach age 70 there there has
 
01:00:33.109 --> 01:00:33.119 align:start position:0%
to be some other there are other policy
 
01:00:35.190 --> 01:00:35.200 align:start position:0%
reasons for having a mandatory
 
01:00:37.950 --> 01:00:37.960 align:start position:0%
retirement age and in my opinion one of
 
01:00:40.670 --> 01:00:40.680 align:start position:0%
those is the value in regular turnover
 
01:00:45.510 --> 01:00:45.520 align:start position:0%
on the bench um and having uh older
 
01:00:49.109 --> 01:00:49.119 align:start position:0%
judges more longer tenure judges retire
 
01:00:53.549 --> 01:00:53.559 align:start position:0%
and younger uh newer judges take their
 
01:00:56.230 --> 01:00:56.240 align:start position:0%
take their place it guards against the
 
01:00:58.630 --> 01:00:58.640 align:start position:0%
judges who've been on the court
 
01:01:02.150 --> 01:01:02.160 align:start position:0%
sometimes for decades um being from
 
01:01:03.829 --> 01:01:03.839 align:start position:0%
becoming out of touch with the
 
01:01:05.789 --> 01:01:05.799 align:start position:0%
profession or the law through no fault
 
01:01:07.950 --> 01:01:07.960 align:start position:0%
of their own I should say but I think
 
01:01:10.910 --> 01:01:10.920 align:start position:0%
that there can be a danger of that if
 
01:01:12.990 --> 01:01:13.000 align:start position:0%
you are out of the practice of law for
 
01:01:15.990 --> 01:01:16.000 align:start position:0%
that length of time and more importantly
 
01:01:17.910 --> 01:01:17.920 align:start position:0%
I would say it allows for fresh
 
01:01:20.549 --> 01:01:20.559 align:start position:0%
perspectives on the bench from from new
 
01:01:23.309 --> 01:01:23.319 align:start position:0%
voices A diversity of
 
01:01:25.309 --> 01:01:25.319 align:start position:0%
experience um
 
01:01:28.230 --> 01:01:28.240 align:start position:0%
I was just looking at
 
01:01:31.910 --> 01:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
some um statistics I guess or lists on
 
01:01:35.990 --> 01:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch website and with
 
01:01:38.230 --> 01:01:38.240 align:start position:0%
regard to our Superior Court which is
 
01:01:40.069 --> 01:01:40.079 align:start position:0%
the the trial court of General
 
01:01:42.430 --> 01:01:42.440 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction in New Hampshire where
 
01:01:45.510 --> 01:01:45.520 align:start position:0%
civil and criminal jury trials take
 
01:01:48.710 --> 01:01:48.720 align:start position:0%
place currently it looks like from my
 
01:01:51.029 --> 01:01:51.039 align:start position:0%
reading only one quarter of Superior
 
01:01:54.069 --> 01:01:54.079 align:start position:0%
Court judges are are women um there are
 
01:01:56.789 --> 01:01:56.799 align:start position:0%
zero people of color on the Superior
 
01:01:59.430 --> 01:01:59.440 align:start position:0%
Court uh and in fact I don't believe
 
01:02:01.230 --> 01:02:01.240 align:start position:0%
that there's ever been a person of color
 
01:02:03.829 --> 01:02:03.839 align:start position:0%
on the Superior Court in New Hampshire
 
01:02:05.349 --> 01:02:05.359 align:start position:0%
I'm quite sure that there's never been a
 
01:02:07.029 --> 01:02:07.039 align:start position:0%
person of color on the Supreme Court in
 
01:02:09.309 --> 01:02:09.319 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um and I would you know
 
01:02:11.710 --> 01:02:11.720 align:start position:0%
welcome that the justices to correct me
 
01:02:14.029 --> 01:02:14.039 align:start position:0%
if I'm wrong but I'm pretty sure that's
 
01:02:17.190 --> 01:02:17.200 align:start position:0%
the case um currently you know there's
 
01:02:18.750 --> 01:02:18.760 align:start position:0%
only one woman on the New Hampshire
 
01:02:22.069 --> 01:02:22.079 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court and in my opinion that
 
01:02:23.910 --> 01:02:23.920 align:start position:0%
diversity is not going to increase if we
 
01:02:25.589 --> 01:02:25.599 align:start position:0%
just maintain the status
 
01:02:29.230 --> 01:02:29.240 align:start position:0%
quo so although it could mean and I I I
 
01:02:32.589 --> 01:02:32.599 align:start position:0%
know it would mean losing some good
 
01:02:35.510 --> 01:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
honorable judges such as chief justice
 
01:02:38.589 --> 01:02:38.599 align:start position:0%
Lynn and Justice Convoy I think the
 
01:02:40.670 --> 01:02:40.680 align:start position:0%
turnover can also mean gaining good
 
01:02:42.670 --> 01:02:42.680 align:start position:0%
honorable judges that also have
 
01:02:45.029 --> 01:02:45.039 align:start position:0%
diversity of background and
 
01:02:47.309 --> 01:02:47.319 align:start position:0%
experience um so there there are
 
01:02:49.069 --> 01:02:49.079 align:start position:0%
benefits that that haven't been
 
01:02:51.910 --> 01:02:51.920 align:start position:0%
discussed it's not just about competency
 
01:02:52.990 --> 01:02:53.000 align:start position:0%
and I don't think that should be the
 
01:02:55.230 --> 01:02:55.240 align:start position:0%
only part of the calculus I'll I'll also
 
01:02:58.789 --> 01:02:58.799 align:start position:0%
note that New Hampshire isn't alone um
 
01:03:02.670 --> 01:03:02.680 align:start position:0%
with having an age 70 retirement mandate
 
01:03:04.950 --> 01:03:04.960 align:start position:0%
uh it looks Again by my
 
01:03:08.190 --> 01:03:08.200 align:start position:0%
calculation around 17 states have that
 
01:03:10.630 --> 01:03:10.640 align:start position:0%
requirement so New Hampshire isn't alone
 
01:03:13.510 --> 01:03:13.520 align:start position:0%
there and I'll finally say that just
 
01:03:15.309 --> 01:03:15.319 align:start position:0%
because a judge has to retire from the
 
01:03:16.789 --> 01:03:16.799 align:start position:0%
bench doesn't mean that they have to
 
01:03:19.190 --> 01:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
retire from the law or public
 
01:03:21.870 --> 01:03:21.880 align:start position:0%
service you know first of all retired
 
01:03:23.670 --> 01:03:23.680 align:start position:0%
judges are permitted to continue to sit
 
01:03:25.910 --> 01:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
on the benches judicial referees under
 
01:03:28.789 --> 01:03:28.799 align:start position:0%
current statute so an a judge that is
 
01:03:32.309 --> 01:03:32.319 align:start position:0%
forced to retire at 70 can still hear
 
01:03:34.710 --> 01:03:34.720 align:start position:0%
cases can still issue decisions albeit
 
01:03:36.430 --> 01:03:36.440 align:start position:0%
they have to be approved by a full-time
 
01:03:39.069 --> 01:03:39.079 align:start position:0%
judge and from my understanding all
 
01:03:42.190 --> 01:03:42.200 align:start position:0%
retired judges have that option um
 
01:03:44.069 --> 01:03:44.079 align:start position:0%
others become you know respected
 
01:03:46.510 --> 01:03:46.520 align:start position:0%
mediators or return to private practice
 
01:03:48.950 --> 01:03:48.960 align:start position:0%
some like our our the chairman here and
 
01:03:50.910 --> 01:03:50.920 align:start position:0%
chief justice Lynn join us in the house
 
01:03:53.109 --> 01:03:53.119 align:start position:0%
and we benefit greatly from their
 
01:03:56.470 --> 01:03:56.480 align:start position:0%
expertise and wisdom so again with
 
01:03:58.069 --> 01:03:58.079 align:start position:0%
considering all those things and then
 
01:03:59.670 --> 01:03:59.680 align:start position:0%
considering the benefits that we gain
 
01:04:03.069 --> 01:04:03.079 align:start position:0%
from having um fresh perspectives and a
 
01:04:06.430 --> 01:04:06.440 align:start position:0%
diversity of uh experience in the
 
01:04:08.589 --> 01:04:08.599 align:start position:0%
Judiciary I think that those are just
 
01:04:10.829 --> 01:04:10.839 align:start position:0%
considerations that the committee should
 
01:04:13.029 --> 01:04:13.039 align:start position:0%
consider as well as the points that have
 
01:04:15.430 --> 01:04:15.440 align:start position:0%
been made by representative Lynn and
 
01:04:19.230 --> 01:04:19.240 align:start position:0%
some other uh folks who are testifying
 
01:04:23.190 --> 01:04:23.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:27.750 align:start position:0%
 
questions

01:04:27.750 --> 01:04:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:35.710 --> 01:04:35.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:35.720 --> 01:04:53.150 align:start position:0%
 
testimony

01:04:53.150 --> 01:04:53.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:53.160 --> 01:05:02.990 align:start position:0%
 
for

01:05:02.990 --> 01:05:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:05.829 --> 01:05:05.839 align:start position:0%
it's very difficult to hear the chair

75 um we do have
 
01:07:41.309 --> 01:07:41.319 align:start position:0%
reservations um with respect to the uh
 
01:07:46.309 --> 01:07:46.319 align:start position:0%
the governor and Council piece um as as
 
01:07:50.390 --> 01:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
was uh spoken about by former speaker
 
01:07:54.150 --> 01:07:54.160 align:start position:0%
scitec um we would Echo the the comments
 
01:07:58.670 --> 01:07:58.680 align:start position:0%
that the Judge Lynn made um and speaker
 
01:08:02.190 --> 01:08:02.200 align:start position:0%
scitec made and um you know we believe
 
01:08:04.029 --> 01:08:04.039 align:start position:0%
that there are existing checks and
 
01:08:07.510 --> 01:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
balances uh in the judicial system um
 
01:08:10.510 --> 01:08:10.520 align:start position:0%
for evaluating whether or not judges are
 
01:08:12.870 --> 01:08:12.880 align:start position:0%
qualified and that the age limit has
 
01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:14.510 align:start position:0%
qualified and that the age limit has
become

01:08:14.510 --> 01:08:14.520 align:start position:0%
become
 
01:08:18.070 --> 01:08:18.080 align:start position:0%
unnecessary um we do think that uh
 
01:08:21.269 --> 01:08:21.279 align:start position:0%
adding the um the partisan potentially
 
01:08:22.910 --> 01:08:22.920 align:start position:0%
partisan evaluation of governor and
 
01:08:28.269 --> 01:08:28.279 align:start position:0%
councel is um not necessarily the best
 
01:08:31.550 --> 01:08:31.560 align:start position:0%
practice here our suggestion would be
 
01:08:34.669 --> 01:08:34.679 align:start position:0%
that if there is to be an evaluatory
 
01:08:38.149 --> 01:08:38.159 align:start position:0%
mechanism um for a judge serving another
 
01:08:41.030 --> 01:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
five years that it fall upon um the
 
01:08:44.669 --> 01:08:44.679 align:start position:0%
judicial conduct committee um they are
 
01:08:48.030 --> 01:08:48.040 align:start position:0%
specifically and uniquely equipped to
 
01:08:50.229 --> 01:08:50.239 align:start position:0%
evaluate uh judges and judicial
 
01:08:52.550 --> 01:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
performance the there as I understand an
 
01:08:54.950 --> 01:08:54.960 align:start position:0%
11 member panel
 
01:08:58.269 --> 01:08:58.279 align:start position:0%
um with members uh a diverse membership
 
01:09:01.309 --> 01:09:01.319 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan membership and appointed
 
01:09:04.189 --> 01:09:04.199 align:start position:0%
from many different areas of of the
 
01:09:06.430 --> 01:09:06.440 align:start position:0%
state government you know appointed by
 
01:09:08.789 --> 01:09:08.799 align:start position:0%
the the governor or the senate or the or
 
01:09:12.669 --> 01:09:12.679 align:start position:0%
the speaker um and
 
01:09:15.030 --> 01:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
uh We've
 
01:09:18.550 --> 01:09:18.560 align:start position:0%
uh we simply believe that um you know
 
01:09:20.749 --> 01:09:20.759 align:start position:0%
there there are many uh really great
 
01:09:24.110 --> 01:09:24.120 align:start position:0%
very wise uh judges that unfortunately
 
01:09:26.709 --> 01:09:26.719 align:start position:0%
aren't aren't able to serve anymore and
 
01:09:29.749 --> 01:09:29.759 align:start position:0%
and that's very unfortunate so um we
 
01:09:32.110 --> 01:09:32.120 align:start position:0%
believe that increasing the age to
 
01:09:37.990 --> 01:09:38.000 align:start position:0%
75 is um uh is is a positive move um but
 
01:09:39.990 --> 01:09:40.000 align:start position:0%
if there is to be an evaluation
 
01:09:42.390 --> 01:09:42.400 align:start position:0%
mechanism it should fall to the judicial
 
01:09:45.749 --> 01:09:45.759 align:start position:0%
conduct committee um and if uh if there
 
01:09:49.110 --> 01:09:49.120 align:start position:0%
are any questions I'm very happy to
 
01:09:51.630 --> 01:09:51.640 align:start position:0%
address thank you are there any
 
01:09:56.669 --> 01:09:56.679 align:start position:0%

feature because we apparently we have
 
01:11:47.149 --> 01:11:47.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:50.189 --> 01:11:50.199 align:start position:0%

01:12:00.870 --> 01:12:00.880 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
01:12:04.149 --> 01:12:04.159 align:start position:0%
silver thank you Mr chairman uh yes uh I
 
01:12:07.030 --> 01:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
would like to speak in support of the uh
 
01:12:10.430 --> 01:12:10.440 align:start position:0%
proposed cacr as presented uh I'd like
 
01:12:12.470 --> 01:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
to remind the committee that the
 
01:12:14.590 --> 01:12:14.600 align:start position:0%
appointment of Judges is made by the
 
01:12:16.510 --> 01:12:16.520 align:start position:0%
governor and have to has to be approved
 
01:12:19.910 --> 01:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
by the uh executive counsil already so
 
01:12:22.350 --> 01:12:22.360 align:start position:0%
having them involved in this is really
 
01:12:24.070 --> 01:12:24.080 align:start position:0%
part of the checks and balance of the
 
01:12:26.189 --> 01:12:26.199 align:start position:0%
system we have between the three
 
01:12:29.550 --> 01:12:29.560 align:start position:0%
branches of government um I've told
 
01:12:31.470 --> 01:12:31.480 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn several times when
 
01:12:34.510 --> 01:12:34.520 align:start position:0%
I've seen him um that I thought it was a
 
01:12:37.990 --> 01:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
terrible shame that he had was aged out
 
01:12:40.510 --> 01:12:40.520 align:start position:0%
a mandatory retirement age really at the
 
01:12:45.110 --> 01:12:45.120 align:start position:0%
peak of his judicial career and when and
 
01:12:47.070 --> 01:12:47.080 align:start position:0%
I and I believe that we we have a
 
01:12:48.910 --> 01:12:48.920 align:start position:0%
situation for many of our judges as
 
01:12:50.910 --> 01:12:50.920 align:start position:0%
they're approaching age 70 they're
 
01:12:53.950 --> 01:12:53.960 align:start position:0%
really at the peak of their expertise
 
01:12:56.750 --> 01:12:56.760 align:start position:0%
their experience their knowledge and
 
01:12:59.390 --> 01:12:59.400 align:start position:0%
really we we then lose the benefit of
 
01:13:02.070 --> 01:13:02.080 align:start position:0%
that uh basically the default provision
 
01:13:03.950 --> 01:13:03.960 align:start position:0%
in this proposed constitutional
 
01:13:06.709 --> 01:13:06.719 align:start position:0%
amendment is that uh they would continue
 
01:13:08.669 --> 01:13:08.679 align:start position:0%
to age 75 unless the governor and
 
01:13:10.910 --> 01:13:10.920 align:start position:0%
Council found that for whatever reason
 
01:13:12.870 --> 01:13:12.880 align:start position:0%
they they should not so I think it's a
 
01:13:15.430 --> 01:13:15.440 align:start position:0%
sound Bill we lose a lot of very good
 
01:13:16.910 --> 01:13:16.920 align:start position:0%
judicial Talent right at the peak of
 
01:13:19.470 --> 01:13:19.480 align:start position:0%
their careers and um you know I'm
 
01:13:22.709 --> 01:13:22.719 align:start position:0%
certainly uh very very happy to have uh
 
01:13:25.430 --> 01:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
justice and I still call him Judge Lynn
 
01:13:28.110 --> 01:13:28.120 align:start position:0%
when I see him uh we're lucky to have
 
01:13:30.750 --> 01:13:30.760 align:start position:0%
him in the legislature with us but we
 
01:13:32.550 --> 01:13:32.560 align:start position:0%
were also very very lucky to have him on
 
01:13:35.070 --> 01:13:35.080 align:start position:0%
the state supreme court and uh he should
 
01:13:36.910 --> 01:13:36.920 align:start position:0%
have served on there for another five
 
01:13:39.030 --> 01:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
years thank
 
01:13:43.149 --> 01:13:43.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:47.910 --> 01:13:47.920 align:start position:0%
you representative party yes I'm well I
 
01:13:50.149 --> 01:13:50.159 align:start position:0%
don't want this is not the time to I
 
01:13:51.790 --> 01:13:51.800 align:start position:0%
don't think it's time to speak for me to
 
01:13:53.629 --> 01:13:53.639 align:start position:0%
speak to this bill there be a work
 
01:13:56.830 --> 01:13:56.840 align:start position:0%
session or um executive session I did
 
01:13:59.070 --> 01:13:59.080 align:start position:0%
sponsor similar they'll just eliminate
 
01:14:00.750 --> 01:14:00.760 align:start position:0%
the age requirement back 10 years ago
 
01:14:04.229 --> 01:14:04.239 align:start position:0%
and we fell 308 votes short of uh
 
01:14:05.590 --> 01:14:05.600 align:start position:0%
getting it to the house but that was
 
01:14:09.149 --> 01:14:09.159 align:start position:0%
then this was now um I do see one option
 
01:14:12.149 --> 01:14:12.159 align:start position:0%
would be for justice Convoy to uh call
 
01:14:14.590 --> 01:14:14.600 align:start position:0%
in call in Via zoom and we could listen
 
01:14:16.669 --> 01:14:16.679 align:start position:0%
to her on the telephone I mean she has
 
01:14:19.750 --> 01:14:19.760 align:start position:0%
her videos working and her
 
01:14:22.830 --> 01:14:22.840 align:start position:0%
audio I think Jennifer for's uh Jen
 
01:14:25.430 --> 01:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
for's analysis the technical situation
 
01:14:28.030 --> 01:14:28.040 align:start position:0%
is uh the same as mine that she has a
 
01:14:30.709 --> 01:14:30.719 align:start position:0%
working video connection but the audio
 
01:14:32.229 --> 01:14:32.239 align:start position:0%
is not hooked
 
01:14:35.189 --> 01:14:35.199 align:start position:0%
up and wor com worse we can probably
 
01:14:36.830 --> 01:14:36.840 align:start position:0%
recess the hearing until such time as we
 
01:14:37.910 --> 01:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
can hear from her because I think
 
01:14:39.669 --> 01:14:39.679 align:start position:0%
certainly the presentation would be
 
01:14:41.669 --> 01:14:41.679 align:start position:0%
incomplete without her input which is
 
01:14:44.229 --> 01:14:44.239 align:start position:0%
always excellent thank you
 
01:14:44.239 --> 01:14:46.229 align:start position:0%
always excellent thank you
representative

01:14:46.229 --> 01:14:46.239 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:14:48.950 --> 01:14:48.960 align:start position:0%
MC thank you Mr chairman I didn't know
 
01:14:50.790 --> 01:14:50.800 align:start position:0%
if representative
 
01:14:56.350 --> 01:14:56.360 align:start position:0%
um uh p p podio podio is isra is Israel
 
01:14:59.189 --> 01:14:59.199 align:start position:0%
still available I had a question for him
 
01:15:01.790 --> 01:15:01.800 align:start position:0%
um basically I wonder if some of his
 
01:15:03.110 --> 01:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
concerns about
 
01:15:07.870 --> 01:15:07.880 align:start position:0%
diversity um and bringing in um you know
 
01:15:09.550 --> 01:15:09.560 align:start position:0%
couldn't be addressed also through the
 
01:15:11.430 --> 01:15:11.440 align:start position:0%
retirement system similar to what
 
01:15:13.550 --> 01:15:13.560 align:start position:0%
representative Simpson was saying that
 
01:15:15.990 --> 01:15:16.000 align:start position:0%
if we made sure um that we were bringing
 
01:15:17.990 --> 01:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
in new people and we could also maybe
 
01:15:19.750 --> 01:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
discourage people staying so long I mean
 
01:15:21.270 --> 01:15:21.280 align:start position:0%
all of those things could be looked at
 
01:15:23.990 --> 01:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
couldn't they in the retirement system
 
01:15:29.390 --> 01:15:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:32.390 --> 01:15:32.400 align:start position:0%
hour represent representative Pedra you
 
01:15:34.990 --> 01:15:35.000 align:start position:0%
are you still available I am can you
 
01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:35.750 align:start position:0%
are you still available I am can you
hear

01:15:35.750 --> 01:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
hear
 
01:15:40.229 --> 01:15:40.239 align:start position:0%
me you like to respond to that sure I I
 
01:15:42.270 --> 01:15:42.280 align:start position:0%
I didn't catch all of the last hearing
 
01:15:45.470 --> 01:15:45.480 align:start position:0%
so I'm not sure I I fully uh understand
 
01:15:47.629 --> 01:15:47.639 align:start position:0%
the representative's question I would
 
01:15:51.310 --> 01:15:51.320 align:start position:0%
just say um yes I guess to the extent
 
01:15:54.470 --> 01:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
that um we can achieve achieve turnover
 
01:15:57.910 --> 01:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
in other ways then that would
 
01:16:00.750 --> 01:16:00.760 align:start position:0%
essentially um work towards that goal of
 
01:16:03.350 --> 01:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
achieving new voices but at the same
 
01:16:07.790 --> 01:16:07.800 align:start position:0%
time I think the reality is um if judges
 
01:16:10.870 --> 01:16:10.880 align:start position:0%
are able to stay on until 75 a lot of
 
01:16:13.470 --> 01:16:13.480 align:start position:0%
them will stay on till 75 and I think
 
01:16:15.550 --> 01:16:15.560 align:start position:0%
chief justice Lynn and the other judges
 
01:16:17.790 --> 01:16:17.800 align:start position:0%
would agree with that so I'm not sure
 
01:16:20.790 --> 01:16:20.800 align:start position:0%
ultimately that that will achieve the
 
01:16:25.070 --> 01:16:25.080 align:start position:0%
goal that at least I have concerns about
 
01:16:28.110 --> 01:16:28.120 align:start position:0%
um without that mandatory age again
 
01:16:29.830 --> 01:16:29.840 align:start position:0%
although it deprives us of some
 
01:16:32.430 --> 01:16:32.440 align:start position:0%
excellent judges it also gains us some
 
01:16:34.870 --> 01:16:34.880 align:start position:0%
excellent judges um perhaps different
 
01:16:40.149 --> 01:16:40.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:44.030 --> 01:16:44.040 align:start position:0%
there thank you and do we have Justice
 
01:16:44.040 --> 01:16:49.750 align:start position:0%
there thank you and do we have Justice
comboy

01:16:49.750 --> 01:16:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:52.870 --> 01:16:52.880 align:start position:0%
that what there first of all there were
 
01:16:55.470 --> 01:16:55.480 align:start position:0%
two two other people who did sign up uh
 
01:16:58.990 --> 01:16:59.000 align:start position:0%
just indicating that they had an opinion
 
01:17:01.390 --> 01:17:01.400 align:start position:0%
with regard to the bill one was Eric rer
 
01:17:02.790 --> 01:17:02.800 align:start position:0%
and just a member of the public who
 
01:17:05.990 --> 01:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
indicated that he supported he did he
 
01:17:10.189 --> 01:17:10.199 align:start position:0%
did not support the bill and and Alvin C
 
01:17:11.550 --> 01:17:11.560 align:start position:0%
also a member of the public who
 
01:17:14.350 --> 01:17:14.360 align:start position:0%
indicated that he was in opposition to
 
01:17:14.360 --> 01:17:16.950 align:start position:0%
indicated that he was in opposition to
the

01:17:16.950 --> 01:17:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:16.960 --> 01:17:20.910 align:start position:0%
 
bill

01:17:20.910 --> 01:17:20.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:25.750 --> 01:17:25.760 align:start position:0%
and and do not we don't do not so what
 
01:17:28.590 --> 01:17:28.600 align:start position:0%
I'm going to do is I'm going to because
 
01:17:31.110 --> 01:17:31.120 align:start position:0%
I certainly want to give Justice Convoy
 
01:17:32.990 --> 01:17:33.000 align:start position:0%
former Justice Convoy the opportunity to
 
01:17:35.030 --> 01:17:35.040 align:start position:0%

police this is my first time in an
 
01:22:31.990 --> 01:22:32.000 align:start position:0%
administrative role and first time
 
01:22:34.270 --> 01:22:34.280 align:start position:0%
testifying before a legislative
 
01:22:36.350 --> 01:22:36.360 align:start position:0%
committee so if you could bear with me
 
01:22:38.910 --> 01:22:38.920 align:start position:0%
as I know you have heard uh drug asset
 
01:22:40.750 --> 01:22:40.760 align:start position:0%
forfeiture bills in the
 
01:22:44.430 --> 01:22:44.440 align:start position:0%
past so we are opposed to House Bill 420
 
01:22:48.470 --> 01:22:48.480 align:start position:0%
if past as I read it the bill dilutes
 
01:22:51.310 --> 01:22:51.320 align:start position:0%
and redirects funds that were originally
 
01:22:53.629 --> 01:22:53.639 align:start position:0%
designed to to support enforcement
 
01:22:56.189 --> 01:22:56.199 align:start position:0%
efforts against drug loss well I
 
01:22:59.590 --> 01:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
completely understand the need and also
 
01:23:02.430 --> 01:23:02.440 align:start position:0%
the importance to further fund
 
01:23:05.790 --> 01:23:05.800 align:start position:0%
establishments of substance misuse
 
01:23:08.669 --> 01:23:08.679 align:start position:0%
addiction recovery rehabilitation
 
01:23:11.229 --> 01:23:11.239 align:start position:0%
centers programs or other
 
01:23:14.350 --> 01:23:14.360 align:start position:0%
services the funds are taking these
 
01:23:16.990 --> 01:23:17.000 align:start position:0%
funds away from
 
01:23:19.430 --> 01:23:19.440 align:start position:0%
enforcement I think would be
 
01:23:19.440 --> 01:23:21.470 align:start position:0%
enforcement I think would be
counterproductive

01:23:21.470 --> 01:23:21.480 align:start position:0%
counterproductive
 
01:23:24.990 --> 01:23:25.000 align:start position:0%
to to the epidemic the opioid epidemic
 
01:23:27.470 --> 01:23:27.480 align:start position:0%
that we've been dealing with and though
 
01:23:29.590 --> 01:23:29.600 align:start position:0%
we are seeing a slight decrease in that
 
01:23:32.270 --> 01:23:32.280 align:start position:0%
opioid epidemic I think we're now seeing
 
01:23:34.590 --> 01:23:34.600 align:start position:0%
a Resurgence of methamphetamine and the
 
01:23:35.990 --> 01:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
things that those
 
01:23:39.110 --> 01:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
bring the drug forfeiture fund it's been
 
01:23:40.910 --> 01:23:40.920 align:start position:0%
administered by the Attorney General's
 
01:23:43.310 --> 01:23:43.320 align:start position:0%
office it served the granite state well
 
01:23:46.790 --> 01:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
for many years it helps offset the cost
 
01:23:49.430 --> 01:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
of conducting resource intensive drug
 
01:23:51.870 --> 01:23:51.880 align:start position:0%
investigations that quite honestly
 
01:23:54.070 --> 01:23:54.080 align:start position:0%
principally Target drug traffickers not
 
01:23:55.110 --> 01:23:55.120 align:start position:0%
the end
 
01:23:57.709 --> 01:23:57.719 align:start position:0%
user placing the fund outside of law
 
01:23:59.550 --> 01:23:59.560 align:start position:0%
enforcement and allowing These funds to
 
01:24:02.470 --> 01:24:02.480 align:start position:0%
be redirected other to other than law
 
01:24:04.629 --> 01:24:04.639 align:start position:0%
enforcement purposes defeats the purpose
 
01:24:05.709 --> 01:24:05.719 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:24:08.629 --> 01:24:08.639 align:start position:0%
fund and again it dilutes it diminishes
 
01:24:11.030 --> 01:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
the fund and I think that what you would
 
01:24:13.750 --> 01:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
see that would be permanent over time
 
01:24:15.870 --> 01:24:15.880 align:start position:0%
the Departments that rely on the funds
 
01:24:17.629 --> 01:24:17.639 align:start position:0%
that support these
 
01:24:19.629 --> 01:24:19.639 align:start position:0%
investigations which result in the legal
 
01:24:22.030 --> 01:24:22.040 align:start position:0%
seizures of drug traffickers profits
 
01:24:24.229 --> 01:24:24.239 align:start position:0%
would no longer be able to conduct these
 
01:24:26.870 --> 01:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
in investigations and therefore the
 
01:24:30.270 --> 01:24:30.280 align:start position:0%
seizures of the drug profits would be
 
01:24:33.350 --> 01:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
eliminated the bill would cause drug
 
01:24:35.910 --> 01:24:35.920 align:start position:0%
forfeiture fund to eventually go to
 
01:24:35.920 --> 01:24:38.229 align:start position:0%
forfeiture fund to eventually go to
zero

01:24:38.229 --> 01:24:38.239 align:start position:0%
zero
 
01:24:43.149 --> 01:24:43.159 align:start position:0%
and who really would be burdened as the
 
01:24:45.750 --> 01:24:45.760 align:start position:0%
taxpayer if they want us to still
 
01:24:47.870 --> 01:24:47.880 align:start position:0%
investigate into drug
 
01:24:49.830 --> 01:24:49.840 align:start position:0%
traffickers there's only a small amount
 
01:24:51.310 --> 01:24:51.320 align:start position:0%
of task forces left in the state and
 
01:24:53.590 --> 01:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
they're already over burdened and unders
 
01:24:55.550 --> 01:24:55.560 align:start position:0%
supported and I think taking the funds
 
01:24:57.310 --> 01:24:57.320 align:start position:0%
away that are intended to help hold drug
 
01:24:59.669 --> 01:24:59.679 align:start position:0%
dealers accountable is only going to
 
01:25:01.470 --> 01:25:01.480 align:start position:0%
lead to more drug
 
01:25:04.830 --> 01:25:04.840 align:start position:0%
traffickers and just really a larger
 
01:25:07.229 --> 01:25:07.239 align:start position:0%
problem so in closing I would just ask
 
01:25:09.550 --> 01:25:09.560 align:start position:0%
you to find this bill inexpedient to
 
01:25:11.470 --> 01:25:11.480 align:start position:0%
legislate I thank you for your
 
01:25:15.149 --> 01:25:15.159 align:start position:0%
consideration I'm happy to answer any
 
01:25:17.790 --> 01:25:17.800 align:start position:0%
questions I I just had one question and
 
01:25:20.430 --> 01:25:20.440 align:start position:0%
that is how much money is involved on an
 
01:25:24.070 --> 01:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
annual basis
 
01:25:26.310 --> 01:25:26.320 align:start position:0%
would you like me to speak directly to
 
01:25:28.149 --> 01:25:28.159 align:start position:0%
to nashwa Police
 
01:25:28.159 --> 01:25:30.430 align:start position:0%
to nashwa Police
Department

01:25:30.430 --> 01:25:30.440 align:start position:0%
Department
 
01:25:33.950 --> 01:25:33.960 align:start position:0%
yes so the the money varies from year to
 
01:25:37.189 --> 01:25:37.199 align:start position:0%
year it very much depends on on the
 
01:25:37.199 --> 01:25:38.629 align:start position:0%
year it very much depends on on the
investigative

01:25:38.629 --> 01:25:38.639 align:start position:0%
investigative
 
01:25:42.870 --> 01:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
success um so for example last year and
 
01:25:45.390 --> 01:25:45.400 align:start position:0%
and well I don't have a specific number
 
01:25:47.430 --> 01:25:47.440 align:start position:0%
if you want I I'd be happy to get that
 
01:25:52.229 --> 01:25:52.239 align:start position:0%
for you in general um I believe we close
 
01:25:58.070 --> 01:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:59.830 --> 01:25:59.840 align:start position:0%
hundred, thank
 
01:26:04.590 --> 01:26:04.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:07.470 --> 01:26:07.480 align:start position:0%
langle thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:26:09.709 --> 01:26:09.719 align:start position:0%
Josh for testifying this morning I
 
01:26:12.790 --> 01:26:12.800 align:start position:0%
wondered um is the the drug forfeiture
 
01:26:16.590 --> 01:26:16.600 align:start position:0%
money the primary source of funding um
 
01:26:18.390 --> 01:26:18.400 align:start position:0%
for your task
 
01:26:21.709 --> 01:26:21.719 align:start position:0%
force and so that money there wouldn't
 
01:26:23.390 --> 01:26:23.400 align:start position:0%
there wouldn't be the funds for the task
 
01:26:25.990 --> 01:26:26.000 align:start position:0%
force is that what you're
 
01:26:30.229 --> 01:26:30.239 align:start position:0%
saying in in nashwa specifically our
 
01:26:32.629 --> 01:26:32.639 align:start position:0%
narcotics unit is fully funded by
 
01:26:35.109 --> 01:26:35.119 align:start position:0%
forfeiture so it's it's not other than
 
01:26:38.350 --> 01:26:38.360 align:start position:0%
officer salaries uh everything else is
 
01:26:40.629 --> 01:26:40.639 align:start position:0%
covered under the forcher fund and it
 
01:26:43.390 --> 01:26:43.400 align:start position:0%
it's rather EX in order to maintain the
 
01:26:45.470 --> 01:26:45.480 align:start position:0%
drug unit if the fund was diminished I
 
01:26:47.390 --> 01:26:47.400 align:start position:0%
think that would put an incredible
 
01:26:49.310 --> 01:26:49.320 align:start position:0%
burden on the taxpayers of the city of
 
01:26:52.350 --> 01:26:52.360 align:start position:0%
NASA and several units are run like that
 
01:26:55.590 --> 01:26:55.600 align:start position:0%
that thank you Mr
 
01:27:00.870 --> 01:27:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:05.270 --> 01:27:05.280 align:start position:0%
Morgan you have to unmute yourself
 
01:27:07.270 --> 01:27:07.280 align:start position:0%
representative got this thank you very
 
01:27:09.629 --> 01:27:09.639 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair the uh
 
01:27:13.830 --> 01:27:13.840 align:start position:0%
amount of money um addition there's
 
01:27:16.270 --> 01:27:16.280 align:start position:0%
implied tradeoff in this bill between uh
 
01:27:19.550 --> 01:27:19.560 align:start position:0%
treatment services and um and you know
 
01:27:23.470 --> 01:27:23.480 align:start position:0%
street level uh street level enfor M
 
01:27:27.870 --> 01:27:27.880 align:start position:0%
um but uh do you find you find that the
 
01:27:30.070 --> 01:27:30.080 align:start position:0%
like but do you you don't but do you
 
01:27:33.350 --> 01:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
find that um that the uh amount of money
 
01:27:35.709 --> 01:27:35.719 align:start position:0%
even if we did put in treatment programs
 
01:27:38.149 --> 01:27:38.159 align:start position:0%
would make much of a difference um on
 
01:27:40.790 --> 01:27:40.800 align:start position:0%
top of like the large amount of funding
 
01:27:42.870 --> 01:27:42.880 align:start position:0%
that those programs already get or you
 
01:27:45.390 --> 01:27:45.400 align:start position:0%
feel you feel like this is the right way
 
01:27:47.870 --> 01:27:47.880 align:start position:0%
to uh to use this money and also you
 
01:27:49.310 --> 01:27:49.320 align:start position:0%
might could you tell us a little bit
 
01:27:52.590 --> 01:27:52.600 align:start position:0%
more about exactly what it is you do do
 
01:27:55.629 --> 01:27:55.639 align:start position:0%
with the money um I should add a I
 
01:27:57.390 --> 01:27:57.400 align:start position:0%
should add that this exact same bill
 
01:28:00.109 --> 01:28:00.119 align:start position:0%
came last year and I was one of uh I led
 
01:28:03.270 --> 01:28:03.280 align:start position:0%
a group of 21 people who voted against
 
01:28:05.030 --> 01:28:05.040 align:start position:0%
something which otherwise had uh you
 
01:28:07.870 --> 01:28:07.880 align:start position:0%
know Brad bipartisan support although I
 
01:28:10.669 --> 01:28:10.679 align:start position:0%
think the 21 of us were on the right
 
01:28:13.990 --> 01:28:14.000 align:start position:0%
side of it that time but anyway so um
 
01:28:15.790 --> 01:28:15.800 align:start position:0%
just tell us a little more about like
 
01:28:18.030 --> 01:28:18.040 align:start position:0%
about how much money it is whether it
 
01:28:20.430 --> 01:28:20.440 align:start position:0%
would make much of a difference add much
 
01:28:22.070 --> 01:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
to what's already being allocated for
 
01:28:23.430 --> 01:28:23.440 align:start position:0%
treatment in Nashville and then also
 
01:28:26.030 --> 01:28:26.040 align:start position:0%
like what exactly it is that you do with
 
01:28:27.830 --> 01:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
the money thank
 
01:28:30.910 --> 01:28:30.920 align:start position:0%
you sure so
 
01:28:33.590 --> 01:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
uh as it stands now that under the
 
01:28:37.470 --> 01:28:37.480 align:start position:0%
current law um any money that is seized
 
01:28:39.270 --> 01:28:39.280 align:start position:0%
and then forfeited to the state to be
 
01:28:41.910 --> 01:28:41.920 align:start position:0%
managed by the attorney general and I I
 
01:28:43.830 --> 01:28:43.840 align:start position:0%
believe they are here today so I I don't
 
01:28:45.910 --> 01:28:45.920 align:start position:0%
want to steal their Thunder and and I'm
 
01:28:48.430 --> 01:28:48.440 align:start position:0%
I'm going to speak in not as an expert
 
01:28:50.910 --> 01:28:50.920 align:start position:0%
on the subject but more just in general
 
01:28:54.390 --> 01:28:54.400 align:start position:0%
uh as the current L stand right now
 
01:28:58.350 --> 01:28:58.360 align:start position:0%
forfeiture once adjudicated
 
01:29:02.030 --> 01:29:02.040 align:start position:0%
45% is returned to any of the agencies
 
01:29:04.950 --> 01:29:04.960 align:start position:0%
involved in an investigation and that is
 
01:29:07.790 --> 01:29:07.800 align:start position:0%
typically split up equally 45% of the
 
01:29:09.950 --> 01:29:09.960 align:start position:0%
fund is maintained by the Attorney
 
01:29:13.750 --> 01:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
General's office in order to not only uh
 
01:29:15.629 --> 01:29:15.639 align:start position:0%
for processing fees but to also run
 
01:29:18.830 --> 01:29:18.840 align:start position:0%
their task force the remaining
 
01:29:22.870 --> 01:29:22.880 align:start position:0%
10% already goes to to treatment
 
01:29:25.550 --> 01:29:25.560 align:start position:0%
and then as that money that has been
 
01:29:30.109 --> 01:29:30.119 align:start position:0%
seized increases uh more money is is
 
01:29:33.350 --> 01:29:33.360 align:start position:0%
pushed in for those treatments So
 
01:29:36.430 --> 01:29:36.440 align:start position:0%
currently in NASA the the money that we
 
01:29:39.390 --> 01:29:39.400 align:start position:0%
take in and again it it varies wildly
 
01:29:42.750 --> 01:29:42.760 align:start position:0%
from year to year um so it it certainly
 
01:29:44.470 --> 01:29:44.480 align:start position:0%
can't be dependent
 
01:29:47.950 --> 01:29:47.960 align:start position:0%
upon but we typically we contribute at
 
01:29:48.950 --> 01:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
the National Police Department we
 
01:29:52.350 --> 01:29:52.360 align:start position:0%
contribute to several programs um I'm
 
01:29:55.390 --> 01:29:55.400 align:start position:0%
also going to be testifying on the next
 
01:29:58.030 --> 01:29:58.040 align:start position:0%
bill and I get into some of the
 
01:29:59.669 --> 01:29:59.679 align:start position:0%
specifics but I'm happy to share those
 
01:30:02.750 --> 01:30:02.760 align:start position:0%
with you if you would like at this
 
01:30:05.350 --> 01:30:05.360 align:start position:0%
point um
 
01:30:07.669 --> 01:30:07.679 align:start position:0%
well representative
 
01:30:12.350 --> 01:30:12.360 align:start position:0%
Sylvia yeah um thank Mr
 
01:30:16.550 --> 01:30:16.560 align:start position:0%
chairman um so my question is related to
 
01:30:19.030 --> 01:30:19.040 align:start position:0%
the seizures
 
01:30:22.030 --> 01:30:22.040 align:start position:0%
um when you seize money there is a
 
01:30:24.629 --> 01:30:24.639 align:start position:0%
profit to be made for or at least income
 
01:30:28.270 --> 01:30:28.280 align:start position:0%
to be realized for the department when
 
01:30:29.870 --> 01:30:29.880 align:start position:0%
you seize
 
01:30:35.149 --> 01:30:35.159 align:start position:0%
drugs uh that does not produce any
 
01:30:39.950 --> 01:30:39.960 align:start position:0%
um uh Revenue do you see a problem with
 
01:30:43.109 --> 01:30:43.119 align:start position:0%
the incentivization of uh sorry about
 
01:30:47.109 --> 01:30:47.119 align:start position:0%
the word uses the incentive to uh sees
 
01:30:53.390 --> 01:30:53.400 align:start position:0%
uh cash or assets as opposed to uh drugs
 
01:30:55.470 --> 01:30:55.480 align:start position:0%
so I I I have heard that argument in the
 
01:30:57.790 --> 01:30:57.800 align:start position:0%
past and while I I I understand why you
 
01:31:02.350 --> 01:31:02.360 align:start position:0%
make it I I think that the the funding
 
01:31:04.950 --> 01:31:04.960 align:start position:0%
does so much for the individual police
 
01:31:07.350 --> 01:31:07.360 align:start position:0%
departments and allows them to to do
 
01:31:09.990 --> 01:31:10.000 align:start position:0%
many of the things that they otherwise
 
01:31:12.990 --> 01:31:13.000 align:start position:0%
would not be able to do uh for example
 
01:31:15.470 --> 01:31:15.480 align:start position:0%
the the treatment programs that I spoke
 
01:31:19.870 --> 01:31:19.880 align:start position:0%
about um several here within NASA uh it
 
01:31:23.350 --> 01:31:23.360 align:start position:0%
allows us to
 
01:31:25.669 --> 01:31:25.679 align:start position:0%
to further and better
 
01:31:28.070 --> 01:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
investigate uh those traffickers coming
 
01:31:30.229 --> 01:31:30.239 align:start position:0%
into International and into New
 
01:31:32.709 --> 01:31:32.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I mean we are in New Hampshire
 
01:31:34.750 --> 01:31:34.760 align:start position:0%
it's an end State it's not going to be a
 
01:31:37.910 --> 01:31:37.920 align:start position:0%
source state so uh having the resources
 
01:31:41.590 --> 01:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
to expand investigations I think is
 
01:31:43.550 --> 01:31:43.560 align:start position:0%
important it
 
01:31:47.070 --> 01:31:47.080 align:start position:0%
allows items that wouldn't otherwise be
 
01:31:49.990 --> 01:31:50.000 align:start position:0%
covered in a budget but we feel are
 
01:31:52.430 --> 01:31:52.440 align:start position:0%
necessary as a police department
 
01:31:55.030 --> 01:31:55.040 align:start position:0%
uh specifically training or safety
 
01:31:58.030 --> 01:31:58.040 align:start position:0%
equipment uh bullet resistant
 
01:32:01.870 --> 01:32:01.880 align:start position:0%
vests it'll it makes a it's a good
 
01:32:05.950 --> 01:32:05.960 align:start position:0%
option uh and and it
 
01:32:08.310 --> 01:32:08.320 align:start position:0%
places it does not place the burden on
 
01:32:11.870 --> 01:32:11.880 align:start position:0%
the taxpayer and instead it it really
 
01:32:14.229 --> 01:32:14.239 align:start position:0%
inhibits those drug traffickers it
 
01:32:18.830 --> 01:32:18.840 align:start position:0%
inhibits their ability uh and and it
 
01:32:20.430 --> 01:32:20.440 align:start position:0%
keeps them out of the state knowing that
 
01:32:25.189 --> 01:32:25.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:35.390 --> 01:32:35.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:40.590 --> 01:32:40.600 align:start position:0%
foric and represent did I cut you
 
01:32:44.109 --> 01:32:44.119 align:start position:0%
off you all set pretty much all said I
 
01:32:46.189 --> 01:32:46.199 align:start position:0%
was just going to thank uh thank the
 
01:32:49.030 --> 01:32:49.040 align:start position:0%
officer for giving a very excellent
 
01:32:51.229 --> 01:32:51.239 align:start position:0%
brief summary of the fiscal notes so if
 
01:32:53.790 --> 01:32:53.800 align:start position:0%
he ever wants to uh ever gets tired of
 
01:32:56.070 --> 01:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
police work he might have a good there
 
01:32:57.709 --> 01:32:57.719 align:start position:0%
might be future for with the office of
 
01:33:00.310 --> 01:33:00.320 align:start position:0%
legislative Services because that was uh
 
01:33:01.830 --> 01:33:01.840 align:start position:0%
much clearer than what's in the fiscal
 
01:33:03.629 --> 01:33:03.639 align:start position:0%
note not that the fiscal note isn't
 
01:33:05.350 --> 01:33:05.360 align:start position:0%
excellent but so I just wanted to thank
 
01:33:07.229 --> 01:33:07.239 align:start position:0%
him so that's that's about all I had to
 
01:33:08.950 --> 01:33:08.960 align:start position:0%
say I did have a followup but that was
 
01:33:11.030 --> 01:33:11.040 align:start position:0%
pretty much my followup and I could
 
01:33:12.350 --> 01:33:12.360 align:start position:0%
thank you I'd be happy I would you
 
01:33:14.910 --> 01:33:14.920 align:start position:0%
believe to it if you'd like me to thank
 
01:33:18.350 --> 01:33:18.360 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you thank you to the
 
01:33:20.750 --> 01:33:20.760 align:start position:0%
officer it appears to me that
 
01:33:24.350 --> 01:33:24.360 align:start position:0%
representative may have joined
 
01:33:28.669 --> 01:33:28.679 align:start position:0%
us representa Fain are you available at
 
01:33:28.679 --> 01:33:29.669 align:start position:0%
us representa Fain are you available at
this

01:33:29.669 --> 01:33:29.679 align:start position:0%

01:33:33.149 --> 01:33:33.159 align:start position:0%
point I am I'm sorry for being late I
 
01:33:34.629 --> 01:33:34.639 align:start position:0%
did not see the notification come
 
01:33:36.790 --> 01:33:36.800 align:start position:0%
through in my
 
01:33:40.550 --> 01:33:40.560 align:start position:0%
email okay you feel free to
 
01:33:43.510 --> 01:33:43.520 align:start position:0%
testify thank you so much uh Mr chair
 
01:33:46.189 --> 01:33:46.199 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee I I am uh
 
01:33:48.189 --> 01:33:48.199 align:start position:0%
here to talk about my bill as was
 
01:33:50.430 --> 01:33:50.440 align:start position:0%
mentioned previously this bill uh was
 
01:33:52.470 --> 01:33:52.480 align:start position:0%
submitted uh last last term and had
 
01:33:55.310 --> 01:33:55.320 align:start position:0%
broad bipartisan support it did run into
 
01:33:58.790 --> 01:33:58.800 align:start position:0%
some problems in Ways and Means um and
 
01:34:01.030 --> 01:34:01.040 align:start position:0%
we fixed all of those problems with the
 
01:34:04.070 --> 01:34:04.080 align:start position:0%
bill and have put it back in this time
 
01:34:07.390 --> 01:34:07.400 align:start position:0%
with some clarification that shows uh
 
01:34:11.510 --> 01:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
that direct reimbursement for costs to
 
01:34:14.390 --> 01:34:14.400 align:start position:0%
these officers and to the or to any
 
01:34:16.310 --> 01:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
department and to the
 
01:34:18.669 --> 01:34:18.679 align:start position:0%
prosecution shall also include money
 
01:34:22.030 --> 01:34:22.040 align:start position:0%
used for the drug buys and um
 
01:34:23.390 --> 01:34:23.400 align:start position:0%
and for
 
01:34:27.669 --> 01:34:27.679 align:start position:0%
the um time of the officers their
 
01:34:30.149 --> 01:34:30.159 align:start position:0%
payroll also reasonable towing for any
 
01:34:32.189 --> 01:34:32.199 align:start position:0%
forfeited vehicles and any non-personnel
 
01:34:35.709 --> 01:34:35.719 align:start position:0%
operating costs so that we could explain
 
01:34:37.510 --> 01:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
further that these police departments
 
01:34:42.229 --> 01:34:42.239 align:start position:0%
are not going to realize a reduction in
 
01:34:45.750 --> 01:34:45.760 align:start position:0%
funds to conduct their operations in
 
01:34:48.030 --> 01:34:48.040 align:start position:0%
fact that's a a fallacy a lot of these
 
01:34:50.709 --> 01:34:50.719 align:start position:0%
departments may actually get more from
 
01:34:52.350 --> 01:34:52.360 align:start position:0%
this new bill than they were getting
 
01:34:54.790 --> 01:34:54.800 align:start position:0%
previously if they're doing small
 
01:34:57.229 --> 01:34:57.239 align:start position:0%
arrests it's only when the large arrest
 
01:34:59.629 --> 01:34:59.639 align:start position:0%
comes in that they would be not
 
01:34:59.639 --> 01:35:00.430 align:start position:0%
comes in that they would be not
receiving

01:35:00.430 --> 01:35:00.440 align:start position:0%
receiving
 
01:35:03.149 --> 01:35:03.159 align:start position:0%
45% but instead receiving direct
 
01:35:05.470 --> 01:35:05.480 align:start position:0%
reimbursement for all costs that they
 
01:35:08.229 --> 01:35:08.239 align:start position:0%
incurred for all of their personnel both
 
01:35:11.070 --> 01:35:11.080 align:start position:0%
in the arrest in the uh setup and
 
01:35:14.070 --> 01:35:14.080 align:start position:0%
investigation and in the prosecution so
 
01:35:16.070 --> 01:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
they will not lose any money and on
 
01:35:19.910 --> 01:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
smaller amounts where say $1,000 was
 
01:35:22.470 --> 01:35:22.480 align:start position:0%
confiscated there their costs incurred
 
01:35:24.070 --> 01:35:24.080 align:start position:0%
are going to be more than that thousand
 
01:35:25.350 --> 01:35:25.360 align:start position:0%
so they're going to get the whole amount
 
01:35:28.270 --> 01:35:28.280 align:start position:0%
instead of just 45% so they're likely to
 
01:35:30.870 --> 01:35:30.880 align:start position:0%
actually uh find an increase on all of
 
01:35:32.990 --> 01:35:33.000 align:start position:0%
these smaller busts and only on the
 
01:35:34.669 --> 01:35:34.679 align:start position:0%
larger busts would we be sending that
 
01:35:36.109 --> 01:35:36.119 align:start position:0%
money on to Department of Health and
 
01:35:39.070 --> 01:35:39.080 align:start position:0%
Human Services to ensure that we get
 
01:35:42.070 --> 01:35:42.080 align:start position:0%
treatment and prevention for the victims
 
01:35:44.310 --> 01:35:44.320 align:start position:0%
of these people committing the crimes
 
01:35:46.109 --> 01:35:46.119 align:start position:0%
and and selling the
 
01:35:49.229 --> 01:35:49.239 align:start position:0%
drugs we've also included now a uh a
 
01:35:52.790 --> 01:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
line that allows the department to
 
01:35:56.750 --> 01:35:56.760 align:start position:0%
decide not to confiscate a vehicle if
 
01:36:02.270 --> 01:36:02.280 align:start position:0%
it's got a mo a market value of uh
 
01:36:05.310 --> 01:36:05.320 align:start position:0%
$1,500 it's it's Exempted and if if they
 
01:36:07.510 --> 01:36:07.520 align:start position:0%
want to raise that to anything higher to
 
01:36:09.950 --> 01:36:09.960 align:start position:0%
exempt vehicles with a low dollar value
 
01:36:11.430 --> 01:36:11.440 align:start position:0%
they don't have to go through the
 
01:36:14.229 --> 01:36:14.239 align:start position:0%
process of confiscating the vehicle then
 
01:36:17.149 --> 01:36:17.159 align:start position:0%
having to store it than having to sell
 
01:36:19.229 --> 01:36:19.239 align:start position:0%
it and all of that they can just wave it
 
01:36:21.470 --> 01:36:21.480 align:start position:0%
off and say it's not worth us
 
01:36:21.480 --> 01:36:24.629 align:start position:0%
off and say it's not worth us
confiscating

01:36:24.629 --> 01:36:24.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:27.149 --> 01:36:27.159 align:start position:0%
it I'm willing to take any questions if
 
01:36:30.669 --> 01:36:30.679 align:start position:0%
anyone has any any questions for
 
01:36:35.189 --> 01:36:35.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:37.510 --> 01:36:37.520 align:start position:0%
represent thank you very much Mr chair
 
01:36:38.950 --> 01:36:38.960 align:start position:0%
thank you much for the member for taking
 
01:36:40.550 --> 01:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
my question
 
01:36:44.229 --> 01:36:44.239 align:start position:0%
um the uh you have this trade-off here
 
01:36:46.149 --> 01:36:46.159 align:start position:0%
between the uh enforcement and the
 
01:36:48.709 --> 01:36:48.719 align:start position:0%
treatment um
 
01:36:52.470 --> 01:36:52.480 align:start position:0%
so would is there a are those are they
 
01:36:54.990 --> 01:36:55.000 align:start position:0%
actually mutually exclusive or do they
 
01:36:58.310 --> 01:36:58.320 align:start position:0%
um or they uh or is one necessary or do
 
01:37:01.390 --> 01:37:01.400 align:start position:0%
we need or do we need both and if so um
 
01:37:03.870 --> 01:37:03.880 align:start position:0%
why do we have to take money from this
 
01:37:07.629 --> 01:37:07.639 align:start position:0%
to make up for uh make up for make up
 
01:37:09.189 --> 01:37:09.199 align:start position:0%
for like the insufficiency of other
 
01:37:11.189 --> 01:37:11.199 align:start position:0%
sources of funds for treatment so why
 
01:37:14.350 --> 01:37:14.360 align:start position:0%
not uh why not just uh raise the money
 
01:37:16.950 --> 01:37:16.960 align:start position:0%
from uh from from other sources since
 
01:37:18.830 --> 01:37:18.840 align:start position:0%
treatment is not a you know it's not a
 
01:37:21.629 --> 01:37:21.639 align:start position:0%
politically unpopular uh it's not a
 
01:37:24.229 --> 01:37:24.239 align:start position:0%
particularly unpopular program um
 
01:37:27.070 --> 01:37:27.080 align:start position:0%
everybody's everybody's eager to even
 
01:37:28.629 --> 01:37:28.639 align:start position:0%
though we don't have much money but
 
01:37:30.550 --> 01:37:30.560 align:start position:0%
everybody's eager to like send more
 
01:37:33.790 --> 01:37:33.800 align:start position:0%
money to treatment so why is why is
 
01:37:36.149 --> 01:37:36.159 align:start position:0%
there why are you making this trade-off
 
01:37:37.830 --> 01:37:37.840 align:start position:0%
here like are the two mutually why are
 
01:37:40.270 --> 01:37:40.280 align:start position:0%
the two mutually
 
01:37:42.550 --> 01:37:42.560 align:start position:0%
exclusive thank you for the question
 
01:37:44.510 --> 01:37:44.520 align:start position:0%
representative uh I don't consider them
 
01:37:48.109 --> 01:37:48.119 align:start position:0%
mutually exclusive in fact um to answer
 
01:37:49.830 --> 01:37:49.840 align:start position:0%
your one of one part of your question
 
01:37:51.390 --> 01:37:51.400 align:start position:0%
where you ask why we shouldn't raise the
 
01:37:53.669 --> 01:37:53.679 align:start position:0%
money for the treatment in another way
 
01:37:56.270 --> 01:37:56.280 align:start position:0%
um we do that that already but but we
 
01:37:58.589 --> 01:37:58.599 align:start position:0%
are sorely lacking as you can see from
 
01:38:00.229 --> 01:38:00.239 align:start position:0%
the way that we've handled this opioid
 
01:38:02.270 --> 01:38:02.280 align:start position:0%
crisis and people are screaming for us
 
01:38:05.070 --> 01:38:05.080 align:start position:0%
to do something more and I think it's
 
01:38:07.149 --> 01:38:07.159 align:start position:0%
extremely fitting to make the person
 
01:38:09.990 --> 01:38:10.000 align:start position:0%
who's been committing the crimes pay for
 
01:38:13.830 --> 01:38:13.840 align:start position:0%
the recovery and prevention of his
 
01:38:17.310 --> 01:38:17.320 align:start position:0%
victims by taking those assets forfeited
 
01:38:19.750 --> 01:38:19.760 align:start position:0%
from the drug dealing and giving them
 
01:38:21.870 --> 01:38:21.880 align:start position:0%
back to those people who were victimized
 
01:38:24.310 --> 01:38:24.320 align:start position:0%
I think that that's a very wise and just
 
01:38:26.070 --> 01:38:26.080 align:start position:0%
use of the funds that were
 
01:38:29.030 --> 01:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
confiscated and as I mentioned when it's
 
01:38:32.870 --> 01:38:32.880 align:start position:0%
a larger dollar figure or a bust I don't
 
01:38:36.709 --> 01:38:36.719 align:start position:0%
think it is at all justifiable to just
 
01:38:40.149 --> 01:38:40.159 align:start position:0%
give a 45% lump sum to a department even
 
01:38:42.709 --> 01:38:42.719 align:start position:0%
if they did not use that much money in
 
01:38:45.589 --> 01:38:45.599 align:start position:0%
the investigation the prosecution and
 
01:38:47.950 --> 01:38:47.960 align:start position:0%
the arrest I think that it's much more
 
01:38:50.790 --> 01:38:50.800 align:start position:0%
Equitable to say that we will ensure
 
01:38:52.390 --> 01:38:52.400 align:start position:0%
that you continue your operations
 
01:38:53.709 --> 01:38:53.719 align:start position:0%
running by giving you direct
 
01:38:56.510 --> 01:38:56.520 align:start position:0%
reimbursement for all expenses incurred
 
01:38:58.189 --> 01:38:58.199 align:start position:0%
but that when there's a windfall of
 
01:39:00.229 --> 01:39:00.239 align:start position:0%
extra money we make sure that we are

legislative liaison and the senior
 
01:40:20.629 --> 01:40:20.639 align:start position:0%
policy analyst for the division of

behavior Health within

DHHS so thank you for your time today
 
01:40:26.550 --> 01:40:26.560 align:start position:0%
chairman Gordon and members of the
 
01:40:28.510 --> 01:40:28.520 align:start position:0%
committee I'm here to just provide
 
01:40:30.310 --> 01:40:30.320 align:start position:0%
information on behalf of the Department
 
01:40:31.629 --> 01:40:31.639 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human
 
01:40:34.950 --> 01:40:34.960 align:start position:0%
Services DHHS currently has a drug
 
01:40:36.750 --> 01:40:36.760 align:start position:0%
forfeiture fund account in the Bureau of
 
01:40:39.189 --> 01:40:39.199 align:start position:0%
drug and alcohol services and that
 
01:40:41.510 --> 01:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
funding is used for the surveillance of
 
01:40:43.629 --> 01:40:43.639 align:start position:0%
the sale of tobacco and alcohol to
 
01:40:45.229 --> 01:40:45.239 align:start position:0%
miners across the
 
01:40:48.109 --> 01:40:48.119 align:start position:0%
state um there is potential that the
 
01:40:49.430 --> 01:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
division of Behavioral Health could
 
01:40:51.470 --> 01:40:51.480 align:start position:0%
expand or bolster program around
 
01:40:53.350 --> 01:40:53.360 align:start position:0%
substance misuse and addiction
 
01:40:55.550 --> 01:40:55.560 align:start position:0%
prevention intervention and treatment
 
01:40:58.030 --> 01:40:58.040 align:start position:0%
services if proposed changes were to
 
01:40:59.790 --> 01:40:59.800 align:start position:0%
allow for an increased Revenue in this
 
01:41:03.149 --> 01:41:03.159 align:start position:0%
account but the amount is indeterminable
 
01:41:05.990 --> 01:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
at this time and DJJ is not currently
 
01:41:08.109 --> 01:41:08.119 align:start position:0%
reimburse cost of law enforcement
 
01:41:10.030 --> 01:41:10.040 align:start position:0%
agencies and would need to you know
 
01:41:11.750 --> 01:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
establish significant policies and
 
01:41:13.910 --> 01:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
procedures for the management of such a
 
01:41:16.910 --> 01:41:16.920 align:start position:0%
fund um the expansion of the
 
01:41:18.270 --> 01:41:18.280 align:start position:0%
reimbursable activities would
 
01:41:20.070 --> 01:41:20.080 align:start position:0%
necessitate additional staffing needs
 
01:41:22.589 --> 01:41:22.599 align:start position:0%
for the Department to manage a fund like
 
01:41:25.310 --> 01:41:25.320 align:start position:0%
this um so we did put in the fiscal note
 
01:41:28.709 --> 01:41:28.719 align:start position:0%
worksheet the cost of a position at
 
01:41:32.709 --> 01:41:32.719 align:start position:0%
DHHS if we were to manage this fund so I
 
01:41:35.070 --> 01:41:35.080 align:start position:0%
just wanted to make sure to provide
 
01:41:37.149 --> 01:41:37.159 align:start position:0%
information on that and I'd be happy to
 
01:41:39.390 --> 01:41:39.400 align:start position:0%
take any
 
01:41:41.310 --> 01:41:41.320 align:start position:0%
questions thank M

Mr chairman and members of the committee
 
01:42:25.149 --> 01:42:25.159 align:start position:0%
for holding this hearing today for the
 
01:42:27.070 --> 01:42:27.080 align:start position:0%
record my name is Ross Connelly I'm the
 
01:42:29.270 --> 01:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
deputy state director for Americans for
 
01:42:31.870 --> 01:42:31.880 align:start position:0%
Prosperity New Hampshire and on behalf
 
01:42:33.950 --> 01:42:33.960 align:start position:0%
of the thousands of AFP activists across
 
01:42:36.229 --> 01:42:36.239 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I would like to voice our
 
01:42:38.510 --> 01:42:38.520 align:start position:0%
support for
 
01:42:41.109 --> 01:42:41.119 align:start position:0%
hp420 substance abuse and addiction are
 
01:42:42.910 --> 01:42:42.920 align:start position:0%
issues that touch nearly every Granite
 
01:42:45.750 --> 01:42:45.760 align:start position:0%
stator I for one grew up in Hollis and
 
01:42:48.149 --> 01:42:48.159 align:start position:0%
have had multiple friends struggle with
 
01:42:51.589 --> 01:42:51.599 align:start position:0%
opioid and opiate uh use usually through
 
01:42:53.510 --> 01:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
no fault of their own but instead they
 
01:42:56.430 --> 01:42:56.440 align:start position:0%
became addicted from prescriptions given
 
01:42:59.430 --> 01:42:59.440 align:start position:0%
uh for sports Industries and and the
 
01:43:02.390 --> 01:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
addiction continued from there as a
 
01:43:04.189 --> 01:43:04.199 align:start position:0%
state we must be critical of our
 
01:43:06.470 --> 01:43:06.480 align:start position:0%
existing policies to derive what works
 
01:43:08.470 --> 01:43:08.480 align:start position:0%
and what does not work in combating
 
01:43:11.310 --> 01:43:11.320 align:start position:0%
addiction reallocating monies forfeited
 
01:43:13.550 --> 01:43:13.560 align:start position:0%
from Criminal drug convictions as this
 
01:43:17.510 --> 01:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
bill does is a common sense step to take
 
01:43:19.910 --> 01:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
approximately 50% of prisoners in the
 
01:43:21.790 --> 01:43:21.800 align:start position:0%
United States are clinically addicted to
 
01:43:24.270 --> 01:43:24.280 align:start position:0%
one or more drugs according to the
 
01:43:26.629 --> 01:43:26.639 align:start position:0%
Federal Bureau of Prisons in Jun June
 
01:43:30.589 --> 01:43:30.599 align:start position:0%
2017 there were over 175,000 total
 
01:43:33.310 --> 01:43:33.320 align:start position:0%
federal prisoners in the United States
 
01:43:36.109 --> 01:43:36.119 align:start position:0%
out of these prisoners over 81,000 were
 
01:43:39.470 --> 01:43:39.480 align:start position:0%
incarcerated for drug offenses or
 
01:43:42.070 --> 01:43:42.080 align:start position:0%
46.2% of the total federal imprisonments
 
01:43:43.270 --> 01:43:43.280 align:start position:0%
in the United
 
01:43:47.470 --> 01:43:47.480 align:start position:0%
States 12.9 billion could be saved if
 
01:43:50.950 --> 01:43:50.960 align:start position:0%
40% of the inmates with drug offenses
 
01:43:53.030 --> 01:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
were sent to treatment centers rather
 
01:43:53.040 --> 01:43:54.310 align:start position:0%
were sent to treatment centers rather
than

01:43:54.310 --> 01:43:54.320 align:start position:0%
than
 
01:43:57.910 --> 01:43:57.920 align:start position:0%
prison treatment is the best way uh the
 
01:43:59.990 --> 01:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
best Pathway to getting those struggling
 
01:44:02.189 --> 01:44:02.199 align:start position:0%
with addiction into a productive life of
 
01:44:04.669 --> 01:44:04.679 align:start position:0%
recovery there is no magic one that's
 
01:44:06.950 --> 01:44:06.960 align:start position:0%
going to fix this problem but we should
 
01:44:09.350 --> 01:44:09.360 align:start position:0%
make policy changes built around what we
 
01:44:12.510 --> 01:44:12.520 align:start position:0%
know Works using a portion of the money
 
01:44:14.990 --> 01:44:15.000 align:start position:0%
from the state drug forfeiture fund to
 
01:44:17.790 --> 01:44:17.800 align:start position:0%
go towards treatment would set a CLE
 
01:44:20.350 --> 01:44:20.360 align:start position:0%
would send a clear signal that recovery
 
01:44:22.870 --> 01:44:22.880 align:start position:0%
and rehab rehabilitation are the
 
01:44:26.109 --> 01:44:26.119 align:start position:0%
priorities not further doubling down on
 
01:44:27.950 --> 01:44:27.960 align:start position:0%
failed policies of
 
01:44:30.310 --> 01:44:30.320 align:start position:0%
imprisonment for these reasons I urge
 
01:44:33.310 --> 01:44:33.320 align:start position:0%
you to support uh hp420 by recommending
 
01:44:36.270 --> 01:44:36.280 align:start position:0%
a to pass and I I thank you so much for
 
01:44:38.910 --> 01:44:38.920 align:start position:0%
your time and uh I'd be happy to take
 
01:44:38.920 --> 01:44:41.229 align:start position:0%
your time and uh I'd be happy to take
any

01:44:41.229 --> 01:44:41.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:45.189 --> 01:44:45.199 align:start position:0%
questions okay uh representative
 
01:44:47.070 --> 01:44:47.080 align:start position:0%
organ uh
 
01:44:50.390 --> 01:44:50.400 align:start position:0%
yes the the actual mechanism the bill is
 
01:44:50.400 --> 01:44:51.189 align:start position:0%
yes the the actual mechanism the bill is
uh

01:44:51.189 --> 01:44:51.199 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:44:54.950 --> 01:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
we just turned money over to HHS so the
 
01:44:57.149 --> 01:44:57.159 align:start position:0%
uh and so this is a little bit
 
01:44:59.830 --> 01:44:59.840 align:start position:0%
inconsistent with afp's um position on
 
01:45:02.149 --> 01:45:02.159 align:start position:0%
other issues which seems to me were
 
01:45:05.629 --> 01:45:05.639 align:start position:0%
asking um HHS and they do good work but
 
01:45:08.470 --> 01:45:08.480 align:start position:0%
they are be fa unelected bureaucrats as
 
01:45:10.990 --> 01:45:11.000 align:start position:0%
you often remind us and they're also
 
01:45:12.430 --> 01:45:12.440 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of different competing
 
01:45:15.310 --> 01:45:15.320 align:start position:0%
treatment um programs and we're asking
 
01:45:19.629 --> 01:45:19.639 align:start position:0%
them to um pick winners and losers so I
 
01:45:23.030 --> 01:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
just wanted to uh see if you had any uh
 
01:45:26.350 --> 01:45:26.360 align:start position:0%
answer as to like uh why that's an
 
01:45:28.629 --> 01:45:28.639 align:start position:0%
effective uh way to support treatment to
 
01:45:32.189 --> 01:45:32.199 align:start position:0%
like turn over this money to HHS with a
 
01:45:34.629 --> 01:45:34.639 align:start position:0%
out a whole lot of guidance on how to uh
 
01:45:37.589 --> 01:45:37.599 align:start position:0%
on how to expend it and it wouldn't also
 
01:45:40.950 --> 01:45:40.960 align:start position:0%
would this not be a new government
 
01:45:43.070 --> 01:45:43.080 align:start position:0%
program oh thank you for the question
 
01:45:45.629 --> 01:45:45.639 align:start position:0%
representative uh our position on on
 
01:45:48.910 --> 01:45:48.920 align:start position:0%
drug policy is is to look at new new
 
01:45:53.709 --> 01:45:53.719 align:start position:0%
ways to address uh addiction and and uh
 
01:45:55.350 --> 01:45:55.360 align:start position:0%
other criminal justice issues
 
01:45:57.950 --> 01:45:57.960 align:start position:0%
surrounding addiction and and the reason
 
01:46:00.709 --> 01:46:00.719 align:start position:0%
for that is that that we found the the
 
01:46:02.990 --> 01:46:03.000 align:start position:0%
burden of putting someone and the
 
01:46:05.109 --> 01:46:05.119 align:start position:0%
collateral consequences of taking
 
01:46:06.870 --> 01:46:06.880 align:start position:0%
someone that is addicted to drugs and
 
01:46:09.750 --> 01:46:09.760 align:start position:0%
only having prison as the solution uh
 
01:46:13.430 --> 01:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
does not in regards to all all available
 
01:46:16.229 --> 01:46:16.239 align:start position:0%
data does not actually reduce that
 
01:46:19.310 --> 01:46:19.320 align:start position:0%
person's uh ability to re-enter society
 
01:46:21.910 --> 01:46:21.920 align:start position:0%
and and and uh have a productive life of
 
01:46:24.910 --> 01:46:24.920 align:start position:0%
recovery and uh you know doing doing so
 
01:46:28.709 --> 01:46:28.719 align:start position:0%
through HHS uh just seems like the the
 
01:46:31.229 --> 01:46:31.239 align:start position:0%
easiest way to immediately address that
 
01:46:34.030 --> 01:46:34.040 align:start position:0%
issue and start to have uh you know
 
01:46:36.870 --> 01:46:36.880 align:start position:0%
criminal money uh as representative
 
01:46:39.510 --> 01:46:39.520 align:start position:0%
Spain pointed out of having money that
 
01:46:41.629 --> 01:46:41.639 align:start position:0%
that was forfeited by the Dr the the
 
01:46:45.390 --> 01:46:45.400 align:start position:0%
drug dealers uh and going towards uh the
 
01:46:48.589 --> 01:46:48.599 align:start position:0%
recovery of the victims of of that drug
 
01:46:51.589 --> 01:46:51.599 align:start position:0%
uh so I I hope that that answered your
 
01:46:55.030 --> 01:46:55.040 align:start position:0%

Supreme Court I served on the court for
 
01:49:57.510 --> 01:49:57.520 align:start position:0%
eight years prior to that I served on
 
01:50:02.350 --> 01:50:02.360 align:start position:0%
the superior court for 17 years I should
 
01:50:05.790 --> 01:50:05.800 align:start position:0%
note that um as an aside in connection
 
01:50:08.470 --> 01:50:08.480 align:start position:0%
with another bill you've heard testimony
 
01:50:11.830 --> 01:50:11.840 align:start position:0%
this morning on the um ju
 
01:50:15.790 --> 01:50:15.800 align:start position:0%
judicial uh pension retirement plan when
 
01:50:19.030 --> 01:50:19.040 align:start position:0%
I went on the court on the Superior
 
01:50:22.950 --> 01:50:22.960 align:start position:0%
Court I left Private Practice as a
 
01:50:26.470 --> 01:50:26.480 align:start position:0%
partner at the mlan law firm and did in
 
01:50:28.350 --> 01:50:28.360 align:start position:0%
fact take a pay
 
01:50:31.790 --> 01:50:31.800 align:start position:0%
cut um I speak to you today in support
 
01:50:34.229 --> 01:50:34.239 align:start position:0%
of cacr
 
01:50:38.229 --> 01:50:38.239 align:start position:0%
6 in 2017 I was required by our
 
01:50:41.229 --> 01:50:41.239 align:start position:0%
constitution to retire because I had
 
01:50:45.229 --> 01:50:45.239 align:start position:0%
reached age 70 I did not want to
 
01:50:49.030 --> 01:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
retire if uh but for the Constitutional
 
01:50:51.229 --> 01:50:51.239 align:start position:0%
provision I would would still be
 
01:50:54.990 --> 01:50:55.000 align:start position:0%
working uh and I am now 73 I don't mind
 
01:50:58.350 --> 01:50:58.360 align:start position:0%
telling you at that time I felt
 
01:51:01.310 --> 01:51:01.320 align:start position:0%
intellectually and physically capable of
 
01:51:03.669 --> 01:51:03.679 align:start position:0%
continuing my work on the
 
01:51:07.470 --> 01:51:07.480 align:start position:0%
court when the mandatory retirement age
 
01:51:11.430 --> 01:51:11.440 align:start position:0%
was established more than 200 years ago
 
01:51:14.510 --> 01:51:14.520 align:start position:0%
lifespans were decades shorter than they
 
01:51:17.910 --> 01:51:17.920 align:start position:0%
are today I researched it and discovered
 
01:51:21.310 --> 01:51:21.320 align:start position:0%
that the average lifespan in the late
 
01:51:25.550 --> 01:51:25.560 align:start position:0%
1700s was less than 40 years
 
01:51:29.910 --> 01:51:29.920 align:start position:0%
old so at that time the age of 70 surely
 
01:51:32.390 --> 01:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
would have been regarded as
 
01:51:35.430 --> 01:51:35.440 align:start position:0%
ancient obviously today many people are
 
01:51:38.550 --> 01:51:38.560 align:start position:0%
able to work well into their
 
01:51:41.430 --> 01:51:41.440 align:start position:0%
70s we are privileged in New Hampshire
 
01:51:44.189 --> 01:51:44.199 align:start position:0%
to have an extraordinarily experienced
 
01:51:45.790 --> 01:51:45.800 align:start position:0%
and dedicated
 
01:51:48.430 --> 01:51:48.440 align:start position:0%
Judiciary unfortunately the current
 
01:51:52.189 --> 01:51:52.199 align:start position:0%
retirement age leads to unnecessary loss
 
01:51:56.069 --> 01:51:56.079 align:start position:0%
of invaluable judicial expertise and a
 
01:52:01.229 --> 01:52:01.239 align:start position:0%
prime example is that chief justice Lynn
 
01:52:04.750 --> 01:52:04.760 align:start position:0%
who was only uh in his position as chief
 
01:52:07.990 --> 01:52:08.000 align:start position:0%
justice for a year and a half was
 
01:52:10.069 --> 01:52:10.079 align:start position:0%
required to
 
01:52:13.990 --> 01:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
retire uh he is an extremely
 
01:52:19.390 --> 01:52:19.400 align:start position:0%
talented judge and um administrator and
 
01:52:22.550 --> 01:52:22.560 align:start position:0%
so the loss of him only after a year and
 
01:52:26.870 --> 01:52:26.880 align:start position:0%
a half was really uh sorely
 
01:52:31.109 --> 01:52:31.119 align:start position:0%
felt I also note that many other states
 
01:52:33.589 --> 01:52:33.599 align:start position:0%
have recognized the Merit of Judicial
 
01:52:35.629 --> 01:52:35.639 align:start position:0%
Service Beyond age
 
01:52:41.109 --> 01:52:41.119 align:start position:0%
70 by my last count 17 states have no
 
01:52:43.589 --> 01:52:43.599 align:start position:0%
mandatory retirement age and that's
 
01:52:46.270 --> 01:52:46.280 align:start position:0%
consistent with the federal
 
01:52:50.550 --> 01:52:50.560 align:start position:0%
system eight states do have a retirement
 
01:52:54.910 --> 01:52:54.920 align:start position:0%
age of 75 and Vermont stands alone with
 
01:52:59.229 --> 01:52:59.239 align:start position:0%
a retirement mandatory retirement age of
 
01:53:03.830 --> 01:53:03.840 align:start position:0%
90 I believe that cacr 6 provides a
 
01:53:07.589 --> 01:53:07.599 align:start position:0%
reasonable mechanism to address concerns
 
01:53:11.069 --> 01:53:11.079 align:start position:0%
that a particular judge May no longer be
 
01:53:14.030 --> 01:53:14.040 align:start position:0%
fit both governor and Council have the
 
01:53:16.830 --> 01:53:16.840 align:start position:0%
ability to assess the judge's Fitness
 
01:53:19.030 --> 01:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
and decline to allow the judge to
 
01:53:21.830 --> 01:53:21.840 align:start position:0%
continue Beyond since age
 
01:53:25.629 --> 01:53:25.639 align:start position:0%
70 now I must note that I agree with
 
01:53:28.790 --> 01:53:28.800 align:start position:0%
Judge Lynn I should say representative
 
01:53:31.990 --> 01:53:32.000 align:start position:0%
ly Lynn in
 
01:53:35.870 --> 01:53:35.880 align:start position:0%
all possible worlds I would prefer a
 
01:53:41.350 --> 01:53:41.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:48.149 --> 01:53:48.159 align:start position:0%
75 but I agree that perhaps this um sort
 
01:53:52.310 --> 01:53:52.320 align:start position:0%
of compromise will appeal to people who
 
01:53:57.310 --> 01:53:57.320 align:start position:0%
are worried that maybe a judge simply
 
01:53:59.310 --> 01:53:59.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't have it
 
01:54:03.750 --> 01:54:03.760 align:start position:0%
anymore um I also note that I appreciate
 
01:54:06.950 --> 01:54:06.960 align:start position:0%
that if this amendment were to pass I
 
01:54:08.709 --> 01:54:08.719 align:start position:0%
would not be able to
 
01:54:13.629 --> 01:54:13.639 align:start position:0%
unretire so my concern is for the system
 
01:54:17.270 --> 01:54:17.280 align:start position:0%
and the state of New Hampshire um in
 
01:54:20.910 --> 01:54:20.920 align:start position:0%
general this is not a personal
 
01:54:23.870 --> 01:54:23.880 align:start position:0%
um issue for me any
 
01:54:27.310 --> 01:54:27.320 align:start position:0%
longer um so I believe that this will
 
01:54:29.589 --> 01:54:29.599 align:start position:0%
benefit our justice system and that's
 
01:54:33.589 --> 01:54:33.599 align:start position:0%
why I support it I'm happy to take any
 
01:54:37.189 --> 01:54:37.199 align:start position:0%
questions are there any uh questions for
 
01:54:41.189 --> 01:54:41.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:44.189 --> 01:54:44.199 align:start position:0%
Convoy see no questions thank you very
 
01:54:45.510 --> 01:54:45.520 align:start position:0%

01:54:48.109 --> 01:54:48.119 align:start position:0%

appreciate your um allowing me to
 
01:54:54.709 --> 01:54:54.719 align:start position:0%
testify um at this time after after we
 
01:54:56.790 --> 01:54:56.800 align:start position:0%
had our technical problems thank you
 
01:54:59.669 --> 01:54:59.679 align:start position:0%
very much we're very pleased to
 
01:55:03.109 --> 01:55:03.119 align:start position:0%
have and that will close close the
 
01:55:05.709 --> 01:55:05.719 align:start position:0%
hearing on cacr
 
01:55:10.669 --> 01:55:10.679 align:start position:0%
6 and we will move on to House Bill 331
 
01:55:16.830 --> 01:55:16.840 align:start position:0%
FN relative to a forfeiture of personal
 
01:55:20.350 --> 01:55:20.360 align:start position:0%
property and we'll call upon the primary
 
01:55:22.709 --> 01:55:22.719 align:start position:0%

01:55:26.629 --> 01:55:26.639 align:start position:0%

committee's

01:55:46.510 --> 01:55:46.520 align:start position:0%
committee's
 
01:55:48.950 --> 01:55:48.960 align:start position:0%
work that took our civil asset
 
01:55:51.870 --> 01:55:51.880 align:start position:0%
forfeiture law and added a
 
01:55:55.109 --> 01:55:55.119 align:start position:0%
requirement of a conviction in most
 
01:55:57.589 --> 01:55:57.599 align:start position:0%
cases this was a great step towards
 
01:56:00.189 --> 01:56:00.199 align:start position:0%
assuring our citizens due process rights
 
01:56:00.199 --> 01:56:02.390 align:start position:0%
assuring our citizens due process rights
were

01:56:02.390 --> 01:56:02.400 align:start position:0%
were
 
01:56:05.229 --> 01:56:05.239 align:start position:0%
protected we have more work to do to
 
01:56:08.270 --> 01:56:08.280 align:start position:0%
extend those Protections ided in our law
 
01:56:09.910 --> 01:56:09.920 align:start position:0%
the federal government has a program
 
01:56:11.910 --> 01:56:11.920 align:start position:0%
dealing with civil asset forfeiture
 
01:56:16.069 --> 01:56:16.079 align:start position:0%
called Equitable sharing this program
 
01:56:18.910 --> 01:56:18.920 align:start position:0%
does not require a conviction as our
 
01:56:20.069 --> 01:56:20.079 align:start position:0%
state law
 
01:56:23.390 --> 01:56:23.400 align:start position:0%
requires Equitable sharing allows our
 
01:56:26.390 --> 01:56:26.400 align:start position:0%
police to bypass the due process built
 
01:56:28.750 --> 01:56:28.760 align:start position:0%
into our state
 
01:56:31.950 --> 01:56:31.960 align:start position:0%
laws civil asset forfeiture has a number
 
01:56:34.790 --> 01:56:34.800 align:start position:0%
of problems besides the lack of due
 
01:56:38.430 --> 01:56:38.440 align:start position:0%
process it sets up perverse incentives
 
01:56:41.910 --> 01:56:41.920 align:start position:0%
which has had law enforcement at times
 
01:56:44.470 --> 01:56:44.480 align:start position:0%
making arrests when dealers are carrying
 
01:56:48.030 --> 01:56:48.040 align:start position:0%
cash as opposed to when they are hauling
 
01:56:52.109 --> 01:56:52.119 align:start position:0%
drugs drugs get destroyed after the
 
01:56:55.109 --> 01:56:55.119 align:start position:0%
trial note that there is a criminal
 
01:56:59.390 --> 01:56:59.400 align:start position:0%
action there but assets can be forfeited
 
01:57:02.030 --> 01:57:02.040 align:start position:0%
and the cash goes to prosecutors and law
 
01:57:02.040 --> 01:57:02.990 align:start position:0%
and the cash goes to prosecutors and law
law

01:57:02.990 --> 01:57:03.000 align:start position:0%
law
 
01:57:05.629 --> 01:57:05.639 align:start position:0%
enforcement you will hear it's not about
 
01:57:09.750 --> 01:57:09.760 align:start position:0%
the money but you can form your own
 
01:57:12.390 --> 01:57:12.400 align:start position:0%
opinions the Equitable sharing program
 
01:57:15.629 --> 01:57:15.639 align:start position:0%
returns 80% of the value to law
 
01:57:18.790 --> 01:57:18.800 align:start position:0%
enforcement our state's criminal
 
01:57:20.950 --> 01:57:20.960 align:start position:0%
forfeiture gives
 
01:57:24.669 --> 01:57:24.679 align:start position:0%
45% to the attorney general's fund 45%
 
01:57:28.510 --> 01:57:28.520 align:start position:0%
to the local department and 10% to
 
01:57:31.709 --> 01:57:31.719 align:start position:0%
DHHS as you can see that is another
 
01:57:34.910 --> 01:57:34.920 align:start position:0%
incentive to use the Equitable sharing
 
01:57:37.990 --> 01:57:38.000 align:start position:0%
program The Institute for justice just
 
01:57:40.669 --> 01:57:40.679 align:start position:0%
released the Third Edition of policing
 
01:57:44.750 --> 01:57:44.760 align:start position:0%
for profits the abuse of civil asset
 
01:57:47.750 --> 01:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
forfeiture their report states that half
 
01:57:50.470 --> 01:57:50.480 align:start position:0%
of all currency forfeitures are worth
 
01:57:52.669 --> 01:57:52.679 align:start position:0%
less than
 
01:57:55.669 --> 01:57:55.679 align:start position:0%
$1300 at that level there is no way a
 
01:57:57.830 --> 01:57:57.840 align:start position:0%
person can hire an attorney to fight to
 
01:57:58.830 --> 01:57:58.840 align:start position:0%
get it
 
01:58:02.510 --> 01:58:02.520 align:start position:0%
back these are not drug
 
01:58:05.510 --> 01:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
kingpens this brings me to the subject
 
01:58:09.470 --> 01:58:09.480 align:start position:0%
of the $100,000 leap to access Equitable
 
01:58:11.189 --> 01:58:11.199 align:start position:0%
sharing in this
 
01:58:14.870 --> 01:58:14.880 align:start position:0%
bill this level of seizure may be more
 
01:58:18.310 --> 01:58:18.320 align:start position:0%
indicative of an organized crime
 
01:58:21.310 --> 01:58:21.320 align:start position:0%
operation in this case the federal
 
01:58:25.030 --> 01:58:25.040 align:start position:0%
program also brings with it the legal
 
01:58:27.669 --> 01:58:27.679 align:start position:0%
resources that might be needed to
 
01:58:29.310 --> 01:58:29.320 align:start position:0%
prosecute such a
 
01:58:32.109 --> 01:58:32.119 align:start position:0%
case if the committee would prefer I'd
 
01:58:35.510 --> 01:58:35.520 align:start position:0%
be happy to remove or adjust this
 
01:58:38.990 --> 01:58:39.000 align:start position:0%
limit and finally it's the duty of
 
01:58:42.270 --> 01:58:42.280 align:start position:0%
legislative bodies to fund the services
 
01:58:43.830 --> 01:58:43.840 align:start position:0%
they wish to
 
01:58:46.709 --> 01:58:46.719 align:start position:0%
prioritize when we incentivize or allow
 
01:58:48.629 --> 01:58:48.639 align:start position:0%
executive branch agencies to seek their
 
01:58:50.109 --> 01:58:50.119 align:start position:0%
own funding
 
01:58:52.709 --> 01:58:52.719 align:start position:0%
we're sewing the seeds that will tend to
 
01:58:52.719 --> 01:58:53.629 align:start position:0%
we're sewing the seeds that will tend to
grow

01:58:53.629 --> 01:58:53.639 align:start position:0%
grow
 
01:58:56.030 --> 01:58:56.040 align:start position:0%
weeds I ask for your support in
 
01:58:59.149 --> 01:58:59.159 align:start position:0%
recommending autopass on HB 331 and I'd
 
01:59:01.030 --> 01:59:01.040 align:start position:0%
be happy to take any
 
01:59:03.149 --> 01:59:03.159 align:start position:0%
questions thank you are there any
 
01:59:08.790 --> 01:59:08.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:13.669 --> 01:59:13.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:16.790 --> 01:59:16.800 align:start position:0%
bur uh thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:59:18.629 --> 01:59:18.639 align:start position:0%
representative Sylvia you and I have
 
01:59:22.589 --> 01:59:22.599 align:start position:0%
gone many rounds uh together and aart on
 
01:59:24.030 --> 01:59:24.040 align:start position:0%
the issue of
 
01:59:29.030 --> 01:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
forfeiture um so let me ask you pretty
 
01:59:30.950 --> 01:59:30.960 align:start position:0%
much the same question I asked when this
 
01:59:35.310 --> 01:59:35.320 align:start position:0%
bill came around last ter as I
 
01:59:38.390 --> 01:59:38.400 align:start position:0%
understand it and I could be wrong I
 
01:59:41.709 --> 01:59:41.719 align:start position:0%
understand it there's three ways let's
 
01:59:44.550 --> 01:59:44.560 align:start position:0%
say um
 
01:59:48.430 --> 01:59:48.440 align:start position:0%
uh assets can be forfeited there can be
 
01:59:52.149 --> 01:59:52.159 align:start position:0%
a completely State operation there can
 
01:59:55.750 --> 01:59:55.760 align:start position:0%
be a completely Federal operation and
 
01:59:57.790 --> 01:59:57.800 align:start position:0%
there can be a
 
02:00:01.229 --> 02:00:01.239 align:start position:0%
combination uh a joint operation so to
 
02:00:04.990 --> 02:00:05.000 align:start position:0%
speak uh and I gather when we're talking
 
02:00:08.870 --> 02:00:08.880 align:start position:0%
about uh Equitable sharing we're talking
 
02:00:10.589 --> 02:00:10.599 align:start position:0%
about the last
 
02:00:14.589 --> 02:00:14.599 align:start position:0%
category uh because I assume we don't do
 
02:00:18.830 --> 02:00:18.840 align:start position:0%
sharing um it's a completely State uh
 
02:00:24.550 --> 02:00:24.560 align:start position:0%
oper or completely Federal if that's all
 
02:00:29.589 --> 02:00:29.599 align:start position:0%
true it's am I wrong in my understanding
 
02:00:32.510 --> 02:00:32.520 align:start position:0%
that in a joint
 
02:00:36.229 --> 02:00:36.239 align:start position:0%
operation where we're trying to decide
 
02:00:38.270 --> 02:00:38.280 align:start position:0%
what money goes to the feds and what
 
02:00:43.750 --> 02:00:43.760 align:start position:0%
money goes to the to the states or or or
 
02:00:47.430 --> 02:00:47.440 align:start position:0%
municipalities that this is money that
 
02:00:51.510 --> 02:00:51.520 align:start position:0%
is seized leg legally uh as part of a
 
02:00:55.550 --> 02:00:55.560 align:start position:0%
joint operation by the feds and then the
 
02:01:00.830 --> 02:01:00.840 align:start position:0%
state applies to take a share of it and
 
02:01:00.840 --> 02:01:01.950 align:start position:0%
state applies to take a share of it and
if

02:01:01.950 --> 02:01:01.960 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:01:05.589 --> 02:01:05.599 align:start position:0%
so doesn't this bill
 
02:01:07.709 --> 02:01:07.719 align:start position:0%
essentially give
 
02:01:11.430 --> 02:01:11.440 align:start position:0%
up a lot of the state's claims to money
 
02:01:13.750 --> 02:01:13.760 align:start position:0%
for which the feds will be perfectly
 
02:01:17.430 --> 02:01:17.440 align:start position:0%
happy to keep more of the money rather
 
02:01:19.510 --> 02:01:19.520 align:start position:0%
than turning the money over to the
 
02:01:22.709 --> 02:01:22.719 align:start position:0%
states that's my concern when a
 
02:01:27.030 --> 02:01:27.040 align:start position:0%
d71 form is filed by the states to
 
02:01:29.069 --> 02:01:29.079 align:start position:0%
collect some of that money under
 
02:01:31.589 --> 02:01:31.599 align:start position:0%
Equitable sharing if this bill passes
 
02:01:34.270 --> 02:01:34.280 align:start position:0%
and we don't ask for that money then the
 
02:01:37.069 --> 02:01:37.079 align:start position:0%
feds just keep it is that
 
02:01:41.229 --> 02:01:41.239 align:start position:0%
right I must say I think I disagree with
 
02:01:43.910 --> 02:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
where your your premise
 
02:01:47.270 --> 02:01:47.280 align:start position:0%
um if a an organization a police
 
02:01:50.629 --> 02:01:50.639 align:start position:0%
organization within the state solely by
 
02:01:53.790 --> 02:01:53.800 align:start position:0%
itself uh makes a seizure and uh I guess
 
02:01:55.310 --> 02:01:55.320 align:start position:0%
we should clarify you know the
 
02:01:56.589 --> 02:01:56.599 align:start position:0%
difference between seizure and
 
02:01:59.350 --> 02:01:59.360 align:start position:0%
forfeiture of course is uh usually gets
 
02:02:01.910 --> 02:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
a little bit muddled but uh police
 
02:02:04.550 --> 02:02:04.560 align:start position:0%
officers sees things all the time uh on
 
02:02:06.950 --> 02:02:06.960 align:start position:0%
the street either with or without a
 
02:02:12.030 --> 02:02:12.040 align:start position:0%
warrant and that is a process that is uh
 
02:02:12.040 --> 02:02:14.189 align:start position:0%
warrant and that is a process that is uh
solely

02:02:14.189 --> 02:02:14.199 align:start position:0%
solely
 
02:02:19.069 --> 02:02:19.079 align:start position:0%
uh done by them it it just takes the uh
 
02:02:21.589 --> 02:02:21.599 align:start position:0%
property temporarily from uh whoever it
 
02:02:23.830 --> 02:02:23.840 align:start position:0%
is so it might be a car it might be cash
 
02:02:26.669 --> 02:02:26.679 align:start position:0%
it might be drugs which are obviously
 
02:02:29.350 --> 02:02:29.360 align:start position:0%
Contraband um forfeiture on the other
 
02:02:34.990 --> 02:02:35.000 align:start position:0%
hand is the process by which title to
 
02:02:38.229 --> 02:02:38.239 align:start position:0%
assets are transferred and that is a
 
02:02:41.310 --> 02:02:41.320 align:start position:0%
court process it happens after the fact
 
02:02:43.669 --> 02:02:43.679 align:start position:0%
the the police do not get to uh just
 
02:02:45.589 --> 02:02:45.599 align:start position:0%
grab stuff and say yep it's forfeited
 
02:02:48.430 --> 02:02:48.440 align:start position:0%
and uh we're gonna go ahead and keep it
 
02:02:48.440 --> 02:02:49.669 align:start position:0%
and uh we're gonna go ahead and keep it
so

02:02:49.669 --> 02:02:49.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:02:52.229 --> 02:02:52.239 align:start position:0%
just to clarify that
 
02:02:56.629 --> 02:02:56.639 align:start position:0%
now the Equitable sharing program allows
 
02:02:59.189 --> 02:02:59.199 align:start position:0%
as I understand it you know I've looked
 
02:03:01.350 --> 02:03:01.360 align:start position:0%
at it quite a bit you have too so uh
 
02:03:04.350 --> 02:03:04.360 align:start position:0%
maybe uh if we disagree we'll have to
 
02:03:07.589 --> 02:03:07.599 align:start position:0%
iron this out a little further but as I
 
02:03:10.669 --> 02:03:10.679 align:start position:0%
understand it a a a
 
02:03:14.550 --> 02:03:14.560 align:start position:0%
seizure which is a totally State um
 
02:03:16.510 --> 02:03:16.520 align:start position:0%
operation there's no feds involved with
 
02:03:20.910 --> 02:03:20.920 align:start position:0%
it that seizure can be adopted out to
 
02:03:24.550 --> 02:03:24.560 align:start position:0%
the federal Equitable sharing program
 
02:03:27.950 --> 02:03:27.960 align:start position:0%
and then that process is then um
 
02:03:32.350 --> 02:03:32.360 align:start position:0%
prosecuted against the uh asset not the
 
02:03:34.629 --> 02:03:34.639 align:start position:0%
person it's separate from the person
 
02:03:37.189 --> 02:03:37.199 align:start position:0%
because the uh Equitable sharing program
 
02:03:40.030 --> 02:03:40.040 align:start position:0%
is a civil process it's an INR process
 
02:03:43.870 --> 02:03:43.880 align:start position:0%
so it's a claim against the property for
 
02:03:46.430 --> 02:03:46.440 align:start position:0%
being guilty for being associated with
 
02:03:50.109 --> 02:03:50.119 align:start position:0%
some uh either drug activity or money
 
02:03:52.470 --> 02:03:52.480 align:start position:0%
laundering activity
 
02:03:56.950 --> 02:03:56.960 align:start position:0%
so when it goes through this this uh
 
02:03:59.709 --> 02:03:59.719 align:start position:0%
Federal process uh the federal
 
02:04:04.830 --> 02:04:04.840 align:start position:0%
government prosecutes the case and the
 
02:04:07.830 --> 02:04:07.840 align:start position:0%
uh the result of that any any funds that
 
02:04:11.709 --> 02:04:11.719 align:start position:0%
come out of that uh 80% of it is uh
 
02:04:14.990 --> 02:04:15.000 align:start position:0%
given to the department that uh made the
 
02:04:18.229 --> 02:04:18.239 align:start position:0%
seizure you know once the the asset is
 
02:04:18.239 --> 02:04:19.950 align:start position:0%
seizure you know once the the asset is
forfeited

02:04:19.950 --> 02:04:19.960 align:start position:0%
forfeited
 
02:04:24.350 --> 02:04:24.360 align:start position:0%
and uh the feds retain 20% of that for
 
02:04:29.229 --> 02:04:29.239 align:start position:0%
their Prosecuting so the question of the
 
02:04:33.709 --> 02:04:33.719 align:start position:0%
uh joint operations and I I can't say
 
02:04:35.470 --> 02:04:35.480 align:start position:0%
that I'm expert on this I'm sure we've
 
02:04:37.189 --> 02:04:37.199 align:start position:0%
got folks in law enforcement that are
 
02:04:38.310 --> 02:04:38.320 align:start position:0%
going to
 
02:04:40.910 --> 02:04:40.920 align:start position:0%
testify the
 
02:04:44.270 --> 02:04:44.280 align:start position:0%
combined uh seizures there is a lead
 
02:04:46.549 --> 02:04:46.559 align:start position:0%
agency when it comes to that seizure as
 
02:04:49.189 --> 02:04:49.199 align:start position:0%
I understand it there is one either
 
02:04:52.109 --> 02:04:52.119 align:start position:0%
department or Special Operations unit of
 
02:04:57.430 --> 02:04:57.440 align:start position:0%
some sort and that U organization is the
 
02:05:01.589 --> 02:05:01.599 align:start position:0%
lead on that and that if it's a federal
 
02:05:05.870 --> 02:05:05.880 align:start position:0%
operation then it's a federal um seizure
 
02:05:09.830 --> 02:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
if it's a state lead on that then it's a
 
02:05:12.870 --> 02:05:12.880 align:start position:0%
uh a state and local thing which can be
 
02:05:14.870 --> 02:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
adopted out to the Fed so that's the way
 
02:05:16.870 --> 02:05:16.880 align:start position:0%
that I understand it and I hope that
 
02:05:19.229 --> 02:05:19.239 align:start position:0%
covered uh everything you need
 
02:05:22.549 --> 02:05:22.559 align:start position:0%
there I could just briefly follow up
 
02:05:23.709 --> 02:05:23.719 align:start position:0%
just to
 
02:05:27.870 --> 02:05:27.880 align:start position:0%
clarify um and I'm looking at the at the
 
02:05:33.189 --> 02:05:33.199 align:start position:0%
uh uh the manual that the uh that's the
 
02:05:34.990 --> 02:05:35.000 align:start position:0%
guide to Equitable searing for State
 
02:05:38.430 --> 02:05:38.440 align:start position:0%
local and tribal law enforcement
 
02:05:42.069 --> 02:05:42.079 align:start position:0%
agencies and basically it
 
02:05:46.830 --> 02:05:46.840 align:start position:0%
says that um in its summary section
 
02:05:49.350 --> 02:05:49.360 align:start position:0%
federal law authorizes the Ag and the
 
02:05:52.350 --> 02:05:52.360 align:start position:0%
Secretary of Treasury to share federally
 
02:05:54.589 --> 02:05:54.599 align:start position:0%
forfeited property with participating
 
02:05:57.310 --> 02:05:57.320 align:start position:0%
state and local enforcement
 
02:05:59.470 --> 02:05:59.480 align:start position:0%
agencies uh the exercise of this
 
02:06:02.510 --> 02:06:02.520 align:start position:0%
Authority is discretionary limited by
 
02:06:05.589 --> 02:06:05.599 align:start position:0%
Statute uh the attorney general and
 
02:06:08.109 --> 02:06:08.119 align:start position:0%
Secretary of the Treasury shall assure
 
02:06:11.390 --> 02:06:11.400 align:start position:0%
that any property transferred to a state
 
02:06:14.950 --> 02:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
or local law enforcement agency has a
 
02:06:16.629 --> 02:06:16.639 align:start position:0%
value that bears a reasonable
 
02:06:19.310 --> 02:06:19.320 align:start position:0%
resemblance relationship to the degree
 
02:06:21.750 --> 02:06:21.760 align:start position:0%
of participation of the state or local
 
02:06:25.189 --> 02:06:25.199 align:start position:0%
agency in the effort resulting in the
 
02:06:28.030 --> 02:06:28.040 align:start position:0%
forfeiture uh blah blah blah and then
 
02:06:30.270 --> 02:06:30.280 align:start position:0%
list the various federal agencies that
 
02:06:33.390 --> 02:06:33.400 align:start position:0%
that are involved in in sending it this
 
02:06:36.069 --> 02:06:36.079 align:start position:0%
seems to say that at
 
02:06:38.910 --> 02:06:38.920 align:start position:0%
least that's the process by which the
 
02:06:41.149 --> 02:06:41.159 align:start position:0%
state gets it from the feds do you think
 
02:06:41.159 --> 02:06:42.270 align:start position:0%
state gets it from the feds do you think
that's

02:06:42.270 --> 02:06:42.280 align:start position:0%
that's
 
02:06:46.870 --> 02:06:46.880 align:start position:0%
wrong no what it that sounds fine except
 
02:06:49.390 --> 02:06:49.400 align:start position:0%
the it sounds like you're talking about
 
02:06:52.030 --> 02:06:52.040 align:start position:0%
the process after it's been adopted out
 
02:06:54.390 --> 02:06:54.400 align:start position:0%
to the federal government once once the
 
02:06:57.149 --> 02:06:57.159 align:start position:0%
federal government gets it then they uh
 
02:07:01.069 --> 02:07:01.079 align:start position:0%
then they uh forfeit the item and then
 
02:07:03.750 --> 02:07:03.760 align:start position:0%
distribute the uh the proceeds that's
 
02:07:05.390 --> 02:07:05.400 align:start position:0%
that's what it's I'm not not looking at
 
02:07:07.790 --> 02:07:07.800 align:start position:0%
that manual myself right now all right
 
02:07:07.800 --> 02:07:08.990 align:start position:0%
that manual myself right now all right

chairman members of the committee for
 
02:08:09.189 --> 02:08:09.199 align:start position:0%
holding this hearing today again for the
 
02:08:11.990 --> 02:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
record my name is Ross Connelly I'm the
 
02:08:13.990 --> 02:08:14.000 align:start position:0%
deputy state director for Americans for
 
02:08:16.350 --> 02:08:16.360 align:start position:0%
Prosperity New Hampshire here to voice
 
02:08:19.510 --> 02:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
our support for HB 331
 
02:08:22.350 --> 02:08:22.360 align:start position:0%
uh in 2016 this legislature passed a
 
02:08:24.470 --> 02:08:24.480 align:start position:0%
bill which strengthened the due process
 
02:08:27.390 --> 02:08:27.400 align:start position:0%
rights of granite Staters the law
 
02:08:31.149 --> 02:08:31.159 align:start position:0%
specifically RSA 617 colon
 
02:08:34.069 --> 02:08:34.079 align:start position:0%
1-A which was passed into law by a GOP
 
02:08:35.430 --> 02:08:35.440 align:start position:0%
majority in
 
02:08:38.189 --> 02:08:38.199 align:start position:0%
2016 requires a conviction before
 
02:08:40.430 --> 02:08:40.440 align:start position:0%
agencies can start forfeiture
 
02:08:43.069 --> 02:08:43.079 align:start position:0%
proceedings unfortunately the federal
 
02:08:45.750 --> 02:08:45.760 align:start position:0%
Equitable sharing loophole is being used
 
02:08:47.669 --> 02:08:47.679 align:start position:0%
by agencies throughout the state to go
 
02:08:50.310 --> 02:08:50.320 align:start position:0%
around state law but thankfully the
 
02:08:52.069 --> 02:08:52.079 align:start position:0%
legislation before this committee would
 
02:08:54.709 --> 02:08:54.719 align:start position:0%
close that Federal loophole the bill
 
02:08:56.950 --> 02:08:56.960 align:start position:0%
forbids state and local law enforcement
 
02:08:59.750 --> 02:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
from transferring C property to federal
 
02:09:02.270 --> 02:09:02.280 align:start position:0%
agencies unless the property contains at
 
02:09:05.910 --> 02:09:05.920 align:start position:0%
least $100,000 in currency effectively
 
02:09:08.950 --> 02:09:08.960 align:start position:0%
stopping most cases of improper civil
 
02:09:08.960 --> 02:09:10.270 align:start position:0%
stopping most cases of improper civil
asset

02:09:10.270 --> 02:09:10.280 align:start position:0%
asset
 
02:09:12.750 --> 02:09:12.760 align:start position:0%
forfeiture this bill would protect New
 
02:09:15.030 --> 02:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizens property rights it
 
02:09:16.629 --> 02:09:16.639 align:start position:0%
will require Granite State law
 
02:09:18.669 --> 02:09:18.679 align:start position:0%
enforcement to comply with state rules
 
02:09:21.589 --> 02:09:21.599 align:start position:0%
for forfeiture preventing state and
 
02:09:24.310 --> 02:09:24.320 align:start position:0%
local agencies from taking assets for
 
02:09:25.990 --> 02:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
their own use without criminal
 
02:09:28.229 --> 02:09:28.239 align:start position:0%
proceedings or due
 
02:09:31.669 --> 02:09:31.679 align:start position:0%
process a recent poll uh a recent yugov
 
02:09:34.990 --> 02:09:35.000 align:start position:0%
poll conducted in September 2020 showed
 
02:09:38.470 --> 02:09:38.480 align:start position:0%
that 70% of Americans oppose the
 
02:09:41.790 --> 02:09:41.800 align:start position:0%
Equitable sharing program such a divide
 
02:09:44.310 --> 02:09:44.320 align:start position:0%
between law enforcement policy and
 
02:09:46.830 --> 02:09:46.840 align:start position:0%
public opinion is a recipe for the
 
02:09:48.669 --> 02:09:48.679 align:start position:0%
distrust that we see in our criminal
 
02:09:52.430 --> 02:09:52.440 align:start position:0%
justice system today across the country
 
02:09:54.950 --> 02:09:54.960 align:start position:0%
this must be corrected to ensure our
 
02:09:56.950 --> 02:09:56.960 align:start position:0%
justice system has the trust to carry
 
02:09:59.030 --> 02:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
out its most critical business of
 
02:10:01.750 --> 02:10:01.760 align:start position:0%
keeping Granite Staters safe this
 
02:10:03.589 --> 02:10:03.599 align:start position:0%
legislature should continue the long
 
02:10:06.069 --> 02:10:06.079 align:start position:0%
tradition of New Hampshire respecting
 
02:10:09.149 --> 02:10:09.159 align:start position:0%
citizens right to doe process and pass
 
02:10:12.870 --> 02:10:12.880 align:start position:0%
House Bill HB sorry House Bill
 
02:10:15.470 --> 02:10:15.480 align:start position:0%
331 it makes sure our law enforcement
 
02:10:17.709 --> 02:10:17.719 align:start position:0%
sticks to New Hampshire law while still
 
02:10:20.069 --> 02:10:20.079 align:start position:0%
having the resources to combat the
 
02:10:23.709 --> 02:10:23.719 align:start position:0%
opioid and Drug crisis with this bill
 
02:10:26.109 --> 02:10:26.119 align:start position:0%
Property Owners will be safe and due
 
02:10:28.950 --> 02:10:28.960 align:start position:0%
process will be restored and for those
 
02:10:31.790 --> 02:10:31.800 align:start position:0%
reasons we urge the committee to move HB
 
02:10:34.950 --> 02:10:34.960 align:start position:0%
331 ought to pass uh thank you for your
 
02:10:37.510 --> 02:10:37.520 align:start position:0%
time again and I'd be happy to take any
 
02:10:39.950 --> 02:10:39.960 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Mr Conley are there
 
02:10:44.549 --> 02:10:44.559 align:start position:0%

thank you uh and thank you uh Mr or
 
02:10:57.149 --> 02:10:57.159 align:start position:0%
attorney Connelly as the case may be I
 
02:11:01.709 --> 02:11:01.719 align:start position:0%
don't know um I have a question that my
 
02:11:01.719 --> 02:11:02.790 align:start position:0%
don't know um I have a question that my
ear

02:11:02.790 --> 02:11:02.800 align:start position:0%
ear
 
02:11:05.950 --> 02:11:05.960 align:start position:0%
caught that this bill
 
02:11:10.270 --> 02:11:10.280 align:start position:0%
apparently requires for Equitable
 
02:11:13.069 --> 02:11:13.079 align:start position:0%
sharing uh cease property to have at
 
02:11:18.910 --> 02:11:18.920 align:start position:0%
least $100,000 in cash or currency
 
02:11:22.149 --> 02:11:22.159 align:start position:0%
and I'm wondering why the currency
 
02:11:27.990 --> 02:11:28.000 align:start position:0%
aspect is required suppose there's a u a
 
02:11:29.790 --> 02:11:29.800 align:start position:0%
forfeiture or
 
02:11:33.350 --> 02:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
seizure uh of a million doll
 
02:11:36.990 --> 02:11:37.000 align:start position:0%
yacht now that's not currency so you're
 
02:11:39.350 --> 02:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
saying that that would not go into
 
02:11:42.709 --> 02:11:42.719 align:start position:0%
Equitable sharing at
 
02:11:44.870 --> 02:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
all uh thank you for the question
 
02:11:44.880 --> 02:11:46.709 align:start position:0%
all uh thank you for the question

a as representative Sylvia pointed out
 
02:11:53.910 --> 02:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
in his testimony uh the
 
02:11:56.950 --> 02:11:56.960 align:start position:0%
$100,000 in currency would be the
 
02:12:00.589 --> 02:12:00.599 align:start position:0%
highest uh uh threshold for any law such
 
02:12:02.870 --> 02:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
as this across the country I believe the
 
02:12:05.910 --> 02:12:05.920 align:start position:0%
next closest is New
 
02:12:05.920 --> 02:12:08.549 align:start position:0%

the highest threshold which is 50,000 uh
 
02:12:26.189 --> 02:12:26.199 align:start position:0%
$50,000 it may be in currency and assets

that's something we're we're certainly
 
02:12:30.549 --> 02:12:30.559 align:start position:0%
willing to have a discussion on um you
 
02:12:33.229 --> 02:12:33.239 align:start position:0%
know the the intent behind that is is
 
02:12:35.750 --> 02:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
putting a level where you're you're
 
02:12:38.310 --> 02:12:38.320 align:start position:0%
really going after the big time drug
 
02:12:42.549 --> 02:12:42.559 align:start position:0%
dealers I if there is a or or large uh
 
02:12:45.470 --> 02:12:45.480 align:start position:0%
big time criminals I should say uh that
 
02:12:48.470 --> 02:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
that that 100,000 uh current currency
 
02:12:51.030 --> 02:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
threshold is is put in place
 
02:12:53.510 --> 02:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
specifically to to address organized
 
02:12:56.350 --> 02:12:56.360 align:start position:0%
crime and things of that matter but I
 
02:12:58.109 --> 02:12:58.119 align:start position:0%
I'd leave it to the committee whether
 
02:13:00.109 --> 02:13:00.119 align:start position:0%
it'd be appropriate to lower that or
 
02:13:05.669 --> 02:13:05.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:11.990 --> 02:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:14.750 --> 02:13:14.760 align:start position:0%
questions seeing seeing none thank you
 
02:13:19.109 --> 02:13:19.119 align:start position:0%
for your testimony thank you Mr chairman
 
02:13:33.030 --> 02:13:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:38.629 --> 02:13:38.639 align:start position:0%
Alber Mr chairman can you hear me can
 
02:13:40.549 --> 02:13:40.559 align:start position:0%
wonderful chairman and members of the
 
02:13:42.990 --> 02:13:43.000 align:start position:0%
committee just for the record my name is
 
02:13:44.189 --> 02:13:44.199 align:start position:0%
Josh Albert and I'm a detective
 
02:13:45.870 --> 02:13:45.880 align:start position:0%
Lieutenant with the nationville police
 
02:13:48.549 --> 02:13:48.559 align:start position:0%
department I realize we just met so I
 
02:13:51.109 --> 02:13:51.119 align:start position:0%
appreciate the opportunity to appear
 
02:13:53.350 --> 02:13:53.360 align:start position:0%
again before you just so
 
02:13:56.149 --> 02:13:56.159 align:start position:0%
soon I'm here to testify an opposition
 
02:13:58.589 --> 02:13:58.599 align:start position:0%
of House Bill 331 on behalf of my
 
02:14:00.350 --> 02:14:00.360 align:start position:0%
department and also the New Hampshire
 
02:14:03.430 --> 02:14:03.440 align:start position:0%
Association of the chiefs of
 
02:14:06.910 --> 02:14:06.920 align:start position:0%
police we feel the bill is unclear it it
 
02:14:09.549 --> 02:14:09.559 align:start position:0%
doesn't make a lot of sense the majority
 
02:14:11.310 --> 02:14:11.320 align:start position:0%
of the seizures in New Hampshire are
 
02:14:13.910 --> 02:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
going to be less than
 
02:14:17.390 --> 02:14:17.400 align:start position:0%
$100,000 and under the current proposed
 
02:14:19.629 --> 02:14:19.639 align:start position:0%
legisl it would force us to have to use
 
02:14:22.990 --> 02:14:23.000 align:start position:0%
the state forfeiture process which
 
02:14:25.910 --> 02:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
returns less money to the
 
02:14:30.069 --> 02:14:30.079 align:start position:0%
agency than the federal system by nearly
 
02:14:34.069 --> 02:14:34.079 align:start position:0%
half and before I hear any arguments for
 
02:14:36.430 --> 02:14:36.440 align:start position:0%
policing for profit I want to talk about
 
02:14:40.189 --> 02:14:40.199 align:start position:0%
some of what that money goes into it
 
02:14:42.069 --> 02:14:42.079 align:start position:0%
affects things like such as the guest
 
02:14:44.589 --> 02:14:44.599 align:start position:0%
speaker that we bring into all the NASA
 
02:14:47.189 --> 02:14:47.199 align:start position:0%
high schools to speak about being a
 
02:14:48.950 --> 02:14:48.960 align:start position:0%
professional ath athlete and it
 
02:14:50.229 --> 02:14:50.239 align:start position:0%
struggles with
 
02:14:53.189 --> 02:14:53.199 align:start position:0%
addiction it would inhibit donations to
 
02:14:56.790 --> 02:14:56.800 align:start position:0%
Bridges the Child Advocacy Center drug
 
02:14:59.189 --> 02:14:59.199 align:start position:0%
courts within the state of New
 
02:15:01.990 --> 02:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh the Police Athletic League
 
02:15:05.669 --> 02:15:05.679 align:start position:0%
and even the Nash youth Council which
 
02:15:09.589 --> 02:15:09.599 align:start position:0%
screens early on youth that are at risk
 
02:15:12.910 --> 02:15:12.920 align:start position:0%
for substance use
 
02:15:15.390 --> 02:15:15.400 align:start position:0%
misuse if this bill is passed it would
 
02:15:18.790 --> 02:15:18.800 align:start position:0%
force us to terminate all educ ation and
 
02:15:21.709 --> 02:15:21.719 align:start position:0%
diversion programs currently supported
 
02:15:23.709 --> 02:15:23.719 align:start position:0%
by the use of those Federal Equitable
 
02:15:23.719 --> 02:15:25.830 align:start position:0%
by the use of those Federal Equitable
sharing

02:15:25.830 --> 02:15:25.840 align:start position:0%
sharing
 
02:15:28.790 --> 02:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
funds under the federal guidelines we
 
02:15:31.709 --> 02:15:31.719 align:start position:0%
can donate up to $25,000 to these causes
 
02:15:34.229 --> 02:15:34.239 align:start position:0%
on an annual basis and we' no longer be
 
02:15:36.470 --> 02:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
able to provide
 
02:15:40.229 --> 02:15:40.239 align:start position:0%
that again this hits on the the note of
 
02:15:43.830 --> 02:15:43.840 align:start position:0%
potentially being at risk for dissolving
 
02:15:45.069 --> 02:15:45.079 align:start position:0%
the narcotics
 
02:15:47.189 --> 02:15:47.199 align:start position:0%
unit because we need a certain amount of
 
02:15:48.589 --> 02:15:48.599 align:start position:0%
money to maintain main this unit and
 
02:15:51.430 --> 02:15:51.440 align:start position:0%
that that money
 
02:15:54.189 --> 02:15:54.199 align:start position:0%
is completely other than officer
 
02:15:56.830 --> 02:15:56.840 align:start position:0%
salaries the the money that is forfeited
 
02:16:00.549 --> 02:16:00.559 align:start position:0%
completely runs this uh this
 
02:16:02.790 --> 02:16:02.800 align:start position:0%
unit so I have submitted some written
 
02:16:05.510 --> 02:16:05.520 align:start position:0%
testimony with some further facts um for
 
02:16:05.520 --> 02:16:07.109 align:start position:0%
testimony with some further facts um for
your

02:16:07.109 --> 02:16:07.119 align:start position:0%
your
 
02:16:09.229 --> 02:16:09.239 align:start position:0%
consideration I want to hit on a couple
 
02:16:12.030 --> 02:16:12.040 align:start position:0%
points that I that I heard in discussion
 
02:16:16.109 --> 02:16:16.119 align:start position:0%
um mostly relative to to due process and
 
02:16:19.109 --> 02:16:19.119 align:start position:0%
I I just want to make it clear that
 
02:16:22.109 --> 02:16:22.119 align:start position:0%
there's a combination of factors
 
02:16:25.549 --> 02:16:25.559 align:start position:0%
where requiring a criminal conviction
 
02:16:28.669 --> 02:16:28.679 align:start position:0%
well make sense is not always possible
 
02:16:30.790 --> 02:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
uh people are there are times when
 
02:16:33.150 --> 02:16:33.160 align:start position:0%
criminals become fugitives there are
 
02:16:36.509 --> 02:16:36.519 align:start position:0%
times when criminals uh enhance their
 
02:16:39.110 --> 02:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
sophistication and often putting assets
 
02:16:42.870 --> 02:16:42.880 align:start position:0%
and money into third parties names so
 
02:16:46.070 --> 02:16:46.080 align:start position:0%
even even though a criminal proceeding
 
02:16:49.870 --> 02:16:49.880 align:start position:0%
is impossible a civil one would be and
 
02:16:51.830 --> 02:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
just to clarify when we're talking about
 
02:16:51.840 --> 02:16:52.830 align:start position:0%
just to clarify when we're talking about
due

02:16:52.830 --> 02:16:52.840 align:start position:0%
due
 
02:16:56.910 --> 02:16:56.920 align:start position:0%
process at the outset of any case the
 
02:16:58.750 --> 02:16:58.760 align:start position:0%
standard of probable cause needs to be
 
02:17:02.309 --> 02:17:02.319 align:start position:0%
met in order to seize any
 
02:17:05.910 --> 02:17:05.920 align:start position:0%
property so we need to you really need
 
02:17:09.349 --> 02:17:09.359 align:start position:0%
to show a direct link to either property
 
02:17:09.359 --> 02:17:10.830 align:start position:0%
to show a direct link to either property
or

02:17:10.830 --> 02:17:10.840 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:17:14.070 --> 02:17:14.080 align:start position:0%
seizure in order to actually seize those
 
02:17:16.589 --> 02:17:16.599 align:start position:0%
funds and
 
02:17:20.589 --> 02:17:20.599 align:start position:0%
then there are obviously limitations um
 
02:17:22.349 --> 02:17:22.359 align:start position:0%
but that forfeiture is going to be based
 
02:17:24.469 --> 02:17:24.479 align:start position:0%
on the
 
02:17:27.030 --> 02:17:27.040 align:start position:0%
facilitation of someone who is quote
 
02:17:27.040 --> 02:17:28.070 align:start position:0%
facilitation of someone who is quote
unquote

02:17:28.070 --> 02:17:28.080 align:start position:0%
unquote
 
02:17:30.750 --> 02:17:30.760 align:start position:0%
involved um and the government must
 
02:17:33.750 --> 02:17:33.760 align:start position:0%
establish a substantial connection
 
02:17:36.389 --> 02:17:36.399 align:start position:0%
between the property and the crime there
 
02:17:40.309 --> 02:17:40.319 align:start position:0%
are limitations on that uh I wanted to
 
02:17:41.750 --> 02:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
make the point that in under the state
 
02:17:44.110 --> 02:17:44.120 align:start position:0%
system if it's less than $1,000 dollar
 
02:17:48.110 --> 02:17:48.120 align:start position:0%
typically the state will not seize it so
 
02:17:50.990 --> 02:17:51.000 align:start position:0%
the $1,300 number that I had heard
 
02:17:54.110 --> 02:17:54.120 align:start position:0%
earlier it most of the times that's not
 
02:17:56.070 --> 02:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
seized if it's less than $1,000 and it
 
02:17:58.349 --> 02:17:58.359 align:start position:0%
sounds like that is the case but
 
02:17:59.990 --> 02:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
furthering in the due process aspect
 
02:18:03.629 --> 02:18:03.639 align:start position:0%
later on relative to the forfeiture
 
02:18:06.270 --> 02:18:06.280 align:start position:0%
process the government has to establish
 
02:18:09.030 --> 02:18:09.040 align:start position:0%
a preponderance of the evidence that
 
02:18:12.070 --> 02:18:12.080 align:start position:0%
that seized property or asset or
 
02:18:15.429 --> 02:18:15.439 align:start position:0%
currency was connected to the
 
02:18:19.270 --> 02:18:19.280 align:start position:0%
crime the preponderance of the evidence
 
02:18:22.950 --> 02:18:22.960 align:start position:0%
standard is recognized in New Hampshire
 
02:18:26.830 --> 02:18:26.840 align:start position:0%
under current statute and that's
 
02:18:30.790 --> 02:18:30.800 align:start position:0%
recognized in a waste management Solid
 
02:18:33.790 --> 02:18:33.800 align:start position:0%
Waste Management cases that by a perance
 
02:18:36.709 --> 02:18:36.719 align:start position:0%
of the evidence property that was used
 
02:18:38.790 --> 02:18:38.800 align:start position:0%
or intended for the use in violation of
 
02:18:46.190 --> 02:18:46.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:48.389 --> 02:18:48.399 align:start position:0%
colon4 that the Pro owner of the
 
02:18:49.830 --> 02:18:49.840 align:start position:0%
property should have known that the
 
02:18:52.389 --> 02:18:52.399 align:start position:0%
property was used or intended for use in
 
02:18:54.070 --> 02:18:54.080 align:start position:0%
violation of the
 
02:18:57.309 --> 02:18:57.319 align:start position:0%
chapter and or that property constitut
 
02:18:59.110 --> 02:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
the proceeds of a violation therefore
 
02:19:00.910 --> 02:19:00.920 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire State Legislature has
 
02:19:02.870 --> 02:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
acknowledged that a preponderance of the
 
02:19:04.910 --> 02:19:04.920 align:start position:0%
evidence burden of proof which is the
 
02:19:07.870 --> 02:19:07.880 align:start position:0%
standard in civil asset forfeiture cases
 
02:19:12.030 --> 02:19:12.040 align:start position:0%
on the federal side does not violate due
 
02:19:15.509 --> 02:19:15.519 align:start position:0%
process I want to make also the point in
 
02:19:20.230 --> 02:19:20.240 align:start position:0%
terms of some of the language
 
02:19:23.589 --> 02:19:23.599 align:start position:0%
where and and I'm hoping to explain that
 
02:19:26.309 --> 02:19:26.319 align:start position:0%
investigations by and large are fluid
 
02:19:29.150 --> 02:19:29.160 align:start position:0%
and ongoing just because an arrest is
 
02:19:30.990 --> 02:19:31.000 align:start position:0%
made that doesn't mean that the
 
02:19:34.070 --> 02:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
investigation is necessarily over and in
 
02:19:36.110 --> 02:19:36.120 align:start position:0%
fact you could stumble upon certain
 
02:19:37.270 --> 02:19:37.280 align:start position:0%
facts and
 
02:19:39.589 --> 02:19:39.599 align:start position:0%
circumstances that would lead you into a
 
02:19:39.599 --> 02:19:40.589 align:start position:0%
circumstances that would lead you into a
larger

02:19:40.589 --> 02:19:40.599 align:start position:0%
larger
 
02:19:42.509 --> 02:19:42.519 align:start position:0%
investigation and really that's what we
 
02:19:45.150 --> 02:19:45.160 align:start position:0%
do in in the narcotics field especially
 
02:19:47.110 --> 02:19:47.120 align:start position:0%
as I made the point during the last bill
 
02:19:49.270 --> 02:19:49.280 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire is an end State we're
 
02:19:52.790 --> 02:19:52.800 align:start position:0%
not a source state so we start at the
 
02:19:55.510 --> 02:19:55.520 align:start position:0%
end and we work it
 
02:19:57.750 --> 02:19:57.760 align:start position:0%
backwards with those investigations
 
02:20:01.070 --> 02:20:01.080 align:start position:0%
being fluid often time our federal
 
02:20:02.990 --> 02:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
partners are called
 
02:20:05.389 --> 02:20:05.399 align:start position:0%
upon in order to assist with the
 
02:20:08.270 --> 02:20:08.280 align:start position:0%
investigation assist by offering
 
02:20:11.309 --> 02:20:11.319 align:start position:0%
resources and that allows us to
 
02:20:15.389 --> 02:20:15.399 align:start position:0%
then ultimately use those resources to
 
02:20:18.510 --> 02:20:18.520 align:start position:0%
to attack those Source States
 
02:20:21.429 --> 02:20:21.439 align:start position:0%
uh as far as the
 
02:20:24.230 --> 02:20:24.240 align:start position:0%
distribution that representative Burch
 
02:20:27.550 --> 02:20:27.560 align:start position:0%
had mentioned uh I have worked in a t in
 
02:20:29.790 --> 02:20:29.800 align:start position:0%
a federal Task Force and and I can speak
 
02:20:31.070 --> 02:20:31.080 align:start position:0%
to that
 
02:20:34.230 --> 02:20:34.240 align:start position:0%
that there are several local members who
 
02:20:36.030 --> 02:20:36.040 align:start position:0%
typically work in task
 
02:20:39.830 --> 02:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
forces and when it comes time to divvy
 
02:20:46.790 --> 02:20:46.800 align:start position:0%
up that 80% if uh based on the federal
 
02:20:46.800 --> 02:20:48.630 align:start position:0%
up that 80% if uh based on the federal
agency

02:20:48.630 --> 02:20:48.640 align:start position:0%
agency
 
02:20:51.349 --> 02:20:51.359 align:start position:0%
determination that can be separated
 
02:20:53.429 --> 02:20:53.439 align:start position:0%
evenly it can be separated by who put in
 
02:20:57.270 --> 02:20:57.280 align:start position:0%
the most work as oftentimes Task Force
 
02:21:01.230 --> 02:21:01.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:03.349 --> 02:21:03.359 align:start position:0%
investigations in closing I I just want
 
02:21:04.990 --> 02:21:05.000 align:start position:0%
to speak to House Bill 420 and House
 
02:21:07.550 --> 02:21:07.560 align:start position:0%
Bill 331 if they were to pass I think
 
02:21:09.110 --> 02:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
that they would directly lead to the
 
02:21:11.349 --> 02:21:11.359 align:start position:0%
demise of this narcotics unit and our
 
02:21:13.190 --> 02:21:13.200 align:start position:0%
ability to prosecute drug traffickers
 
02:21:16.190 --> 02:21:16.200 align:start position:0%
and keep our citizens safe I would ask
 
02:21:18.030 --> 02:21:18.040 align:start position:0%
that you find this bill expedient to
 
02:21:19.750 --> 02:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
legislate and I thank you for your
 
02:21:23.550 --> 02:21:23.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:25.630 --> 02:21:25.640 align:start position:0%
questions representative Smith did you
 
02:21:28.150 --> 02:21:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:31.190 --> 02:21:31.200 align:start position:0%
question yes I did Mr chair thank you
 
02:21:34.550 --> 02:21:34.560 align:start position:0%
very much and um Mr Albert thank you so
 
02:21:38.790 --> 02:21:38.800 align:start position:0%
much for appearing before us um I have a
 
02:21:40.670 --> 02:21:40.680 align:start position:0%
question and if the chair permits
 
02:21:41.990 --> 02:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
perhaps a
 
02:21:46.790 --> 02:21:46.800 align:start position:0%
followup um when you say that passage of
 
02:21:46.800 --> 02:21:47.750 align:start position:0%
followup um when you say that passage of
this

02:21:47.750 --> 02:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:21:51.429 --> 02:21:51.439 align:start position:0%
these bills the one before us right now
 
02:21:55.910 --> 02:21:55.920 align:start position:0%
um uh 331 and the one that we heard uh
 
02:21:59.389 --> 02:21:59.399 align:start position:0%
previous that it would uh it
 
02:22:04.750 --> 02:22:04.760 align:start position:0%
would uh cause the end of your drug
 
02:22:12.590 --> 02:22:12.600 align:start position:0%
program um can you tell me how much of
 
02:22:14.830 --> 02:22:14.840 align:start position:0%
your total
 
02:22:20.030 --> 02:22:20.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:22.830 --> 02:22:22.840 align:start position:0%
sources So when you say drug program are
 
02:22:25.950 --> 02:22:25.960 align:start position:0%
you referring to the narcotics unit or
 
02:22:29.510 --> 02:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
you referring to the programs that we
 
02:22:32.630 --> 02:22:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:36.790 --> 02:22:36.800 align:start position:0%
to um I want you to tell me what I'm
 
02:22:38.870 --> 02:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
referring to because I was
 
02:22:42.910 --> 02:22:42.920 align:start position:0%
unclear um what you said sounded just
 
02:22:46.630 --> 02:22:46.640 align:start position:0%
awful for those of us who care uh to
 
02:22:46.640 --> 02:22:47.910 align:start position:0%
awful for those of us who care uh to
have

02:22:47.910 --> 02:22:47.920 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:22:50.990 --> 02:22:51.000 align:start position:0%
strong uh drug prevention and support
 
02:22:53.830 --> 02:22:53.840 align:start position:0%
programs in this state so if you were
 
02:22:56.469 --> 02:22:56.479 align:start position:0%
not to have these funds what what of
 
02:22:58.590 --> 02:22:58.600 align:start position:0%
your programs would be affected I'm
 
02:23:01.070 --> 02:23:01.080 align:start position:0%
sorry Mr chair I hope you don't mind
 
02:23:02.510 --> 02:23:02.520 align:start position:0%
that I
 
02:23:05.389 --> 02:23:05.399 align:start position:0%
responded I have similar question go
 
02:23:08.150 --> 02:23:08.160 align:start position:0%
ahead thank
 
02:23:12.670 --> 02:23:12.680 align:start position:0%
you so can you tell me exactly what
 
02:23:17.630 --> 02:23:17.640 align:start position:0%
programs would be um would be eliminated
 
02:23:20.150 --> 02:23:20.160 align:start position:0%
if these bills were to
 
02:23:23.030 --> 02:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
pass so the
 
02:23:25.790 --> 02:23:25.800 align:start position:0%
the there are several different programs
 
02:23:25.800 --> 02:23:27.190 align:start position:0%
the there are several different programs
so

02:23:27.190 --> 02:23:27.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:23:31.870 --> 02:23:31.880 align:start position:0%
um Bridges is is a program that um
 
02:23:35.110 --> 02:23:35.120 align:start position:0%
offers advocacy for victims of uh
 
02:23:36.990 --> 02:23:37.000 align:start position:0%
domestic violence and other other
 
02:23:39.990 --> 02:23:40.000 align:start position:0%
victims of violence the nsha youth
 
02:23:44.190 --> 02:23:44.200 align:start position:0%
council is a a program that screens
 
02:23:47.590 --> 02:23:47.600 align:start position:0%
juveniles who've been arrested and
 
02:23:47.600 --> 02:23:49.110 align:start position:0%
juveniles who've been arrested and
and

02:23:49.110 --> 02:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:23:51.750 --> 02:23:51.760 align:start position:0%
often in that screening process it's
 
02:23:55.349 --> 02:23:55.359 align:start position:0%
learned that uh either alcohol or sub
 
02:23:58.750 --> 02:23:58.760 align:start position:0%
some type of substance misuse is on
 
02:24:02.710 --> 02:24:02.720 align:start position:0%
board um and a percentage they take the
 
02:24:06.389 --> 02:24:06.399 align:start position:0%
money and it offers them the ability to
 
02:24:08.950 --> 02:24:08.960 align:start position:0%
to screen a percentage of of the people
 
02:24:11.950 --> 02:24:11.960 align:start position:0%
that come in uh the Child Advocacy
 
02:24:14.750 --> 02:24:14.760 align:start position:0%
Center is is an
 
02:24:19.190 --> 02:24:19.200 align:start position:0%
institution uh that assist s with any
 
02:24:23.190 --> 02:24:23.200 align:start position:0%
real crime against a child um and they
 
02:24:26.070 --> 02:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
offer their services uh I believe one of
 
02:24:27.830 --> 02:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
the other programs I I spoke about was
 
02:24:31.870 --> 02:24:31.880 align:start position:0%
the Chris Haron project uh he's a a
 
02:24:34.750 --> 02:24:34.760 align:start position:0%
local former uh really outstanding
 
02:24:38.070 --> 02:24:38.080 align:start position:0%
athlete uh all the while in his career
 
02:24:41.230 --> 02:24:41.240 align:start position:0%
suffering from
 
02:24:44.349 --> 02:24:44.359 align:start position:0%
uh uh substance misuse so he comes in
 
02:24:46.309 --> 02:24:46.319 align:start position:0%
and he speaks with the high school
 
02:24:46.319 --> 02:24:47.550 align:start position:0%
and he speaks with the high school
students

02:24:47.550 --> 02:24:47.560 align:start position:0%
students
 
02:24:50.389 --> 02:24:50.399 align:start position:0%
uh here in the city and it's really just
 
02:24:53.110 --> 02:24:53.120 align:start position:0%
a wonderful presentation so all of those
 
02:24:55.389 --> 02:24:55.399 align:start position:0%
things all those donations all of those
 
02:24:58.710 --> 02:24:58.720 align:start position:0%
particular programs obviously cost a
 
02:25:02.230 --> 02:25:02.240 align:start position:0%
great deal of money but we can use these
 
02:25:04.110 --> 02:25:04.120 align:start position:0%
the the funding in general be it the
 
02:25:06.590 --> 02:25:06.600 align:start position:0%
state or or through the federal
 
02:25:09.870 --> 02:25:09.880 align:start position:0%
Equitable sharing program that money is
 
02:25:12.150 --> 02:25:12.160 align:start position:0%
is returned into those programs we also
 
02:25:15.309 --> 02:25:15.319 align:start position:0%
donate money to the drug court here at
 
02:25:18.110 --> 02:25:18.120 align:start position:0%
the Hillsboro County south
 
02:25:20.630 --> 02:25:20.640 align:start position:0%
um so those are the programs I'm
 
02:25:23.790 --> 02:25:23.800 align:start position:0%
speaking of and in is relative to the
 
02:25:27.790 --> 02:25:27.800 align:start position:0%
narcotics unit as I've stated this unit
 
02:25:30.630 --> 02:25:30.640 align:start position:0%
is run solely on the the funds from
 
02:25:34.590 --> 02:25:34.600 align:start position:0%
Equitable sharing and forfeiture those
 
02:25:37.510 --> 02:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
cover things uh like equipment training
 
02:25:39.389 --> 02:25:39.399 align:start position:0%
for the officers and
 
02:25:42.389 --> 02:25:42.399 align:start position:0%
detectives phones
 
02:25:48.990 --> 02:25:49.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:53.990 --> 02:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
and really reducing the amount of of
 
02:25:57.389 --> 02:25:57.399 align:start position:0%
money as in 420 I I had a couple
 
02:25:59.670 --> 02:25:59.680 align:start position:0%
questions on that and I I I realized we
 
02:26:02.550 --> 02:26:02.560 align:start position:0%
probably can't Circle back to that but
 
02:26:02.560 --> 02:26:03.670 align:start position:0%
probably can't Circle back to that but
both

02:26:03.670 --> 02:26:03.680 align:start position:0%
both
 
02:26:07.110 --> 02:26:07.120 align:start position:0%
bills affect will be affect our
 
02:26:10.190 --> 02:26:10.200 align:start position:0%
day-to-day operations in this unit I'm
 
02:26:12.110 --> 02:26:12.120 align:start position:0%
hoping I answered your questions
 
02:26:14.389 --> 02:26:14.399 align:start position:0%
representative uh could I follow up Mr
 
02:26:17.750 --> 02:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
chair you certainly may thank you very
 
02:26:21.150 --> 02:26:21.160 align:start position:0%
much um uh and thank you very much for
 
02:26:25.510 --> 02:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
that information um as to the um the
 
02:26:28.590 --> 02:26:28.600 align:start position:0%
programs you mened Child Advocacy Center
 
02:26:32.349 --> 02:26:32.359 align:start position:0%
uh Bridges youth Council whatever um can
 
02:26:35.830 --> 02:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
you tell me um how much what percentage
 
02:26:41.670 --> 02:26:41.680 align:start position:0%
or how how many dollars come from these
 
02:26:44.990 --> 02:26:45.000 align:start position:0%
sources uh to the those programs and
 
02:26:48.389 --> 02:26:48.399 align:start position:0%
what percentage they are of the total
 
02:26:51.950 --> 02:26:51.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:54.349 --> 02:26:54.359 align:start position:0%
programs I believe I believe the
 
02:26:58.309 --> 02:26:58.319 align:start position:0%
National Youth Council it's a just under
 
02:27:01.269 --> 02:27:01.279 align:start position:0%
50% uh the total dollar amount that can
 
02:27:05.990 --> 02:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
be donated uh on an annual basis is is
 
02:27:10.269 --> 02:27:10.279 align:start position:0%
$25,000 uh relative to the percentage of
 
02:27:12.990 --> 02:27:13.000 align:start position:0%
forfeiture that that varies so much from
 
02:27:15.389 --> 02:27:15.399 align:start position:0%
year to year that that I I couldn't
 
02:27:17.790 --> 02:27:17.800 align:start position:0%
speak to
 
02:27:19.870 --> 02:27:19.880 align:start position:0%
to the percentage of forfeiture that it
 
02:27:23.110 --> 02:27:23.120 align:start position:0%
is going back because if there's a year
 
02:27:23.120 --> 02:27:24.670 align:start position:0%
is going back because if there's a year
where

02:27:24.670 --> 02:27:24.680 align:start position:0%
where
 
02:27:28.070 --> 02:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
$50,000 is seized and forfeited to back
 
02:27:30.910 --> 02:27:30.920 align:start position:0%
to the department well then I guess 50%
 
02:27:33.030 --> 02:27:33.040 align:start position:0%
of forfeiture would go towards those
 
02:27:36.950 --> 02:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
programs but again that that number is
 
02:27:36.960 --> 02:27:37.750 align:start position:0%
programs but again that that number is
I'd

02:27:37.750 --> 02:27:37.760 align:start position:0%
I'd
 
02:27:41.429 --> 02:27:41.439 align:start position:0%
be pure purely speculating and I I I I
 
02:27:43.550 --> 02:27:43.560 align:start position:0%
just don't think it's feasible to to
 
02:27:46.870 --> 02:27:46.880 align:start position:0%
know a amount that a percentage that it
 
02:27:51.070 --> 02:27:51.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:53.950 --> 02:27:53.960 align:start position:0%
up and I know this is not this is the
 
02:27:55.750 --> 02:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee not the finance
 
02:27:57.990 --> 02:27:58.000 align:start position:0%
committee and I understand that and I
 
02:28:00.550 --> 02:28:00.560 align:start position:0%
don't expect you to have all the numbers
 
02:28:03.790 --> 02:28:03.800 align:start position:0%
the reason for my questioning is I'm
 
02:28:08.070 --> 02:28:08.080 align:start position:0%
wondering um how the city of nashwa
 
02:28:13.070 --> 02:28:13.080 align:start position:0%
itself um values these programs um has
 
02:28:15.750 --> 02:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
the city made a determination that the
 
02:28:19.710 --> 02:28:19.720 align:start position:0%
only re reason they would uh or the only
 
02:28:22.269 --> 02:28:22.279 align:start position:0%
way they would support these programs is
 
02:28:27.550 --> 02:28:27.560 align:start position:0%
if funds come in from sources other than
 
02:28:32.710 --> 02:28:32.720 align:start position:0%
um the city budget um and that these
 
02:28:36.269 --> 02:28:36.279 align:start position:0%
would be considered um extraneous uh
 
02:28:38.750 --> 02:28:38.760 align:start position:0%
programs otherwise in terms of what the
 
02:28:42.429 --> 02:28:42.439 align:start position:0%
city of NASA has determined for its
 
02:28:45.230 --> 02:28:45.240 align:start position:0%
policy in this
 
02:28:47.469 --> 02:28:47.479 align:start position:0%
area well I
 
02:28:49.349 --> 02:28:49.359 align:start position:0%
I think that the the city
 
02:28:51.950 --> 02:28:51.960 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly supports the opposition
 
02:28:54.269 --> 02:28:54.279 align:start position:0%
of these bills because the the mayor of

04:00:51.590 --> 04:00:51.600 align:start position:0%
edsman would have um the force of Law
 
04:00:53.590 --> 04:00:53.600 align:start position:0%
and no no it would
 
04:00:58.189 --> 04:00:58.199 align:start position:0%
not however there is a route
 
04:01:04.630 --> 04:01:04.640 align:start position:0%
to deal with the legality of the edsman
 
04:01:07.229 --> 04:01:07.239 align:start position:0%
decision and that would be to Superior
 
04:01:07.239 --> 04:01:12.830 align:start position:0%
decision and that would be to Superior
Court

04:01:12.830 --> 04:01:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:15.189 --> 04:01:15.199 align:start position:0%
any further questions for represent
 
04:01:15.199 --> 04:01:20.229 align:start position:0%
any further questions for represent
yenzo

04:01:20.229 --> 04:01:20.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:23.630 --> 04:01:23.640 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:01:25.630 --> 04:01:25.640 align:start position:0%
representative um I'm trying to find a
 
04:01:28.269 --> 04:01:28.279 align:start position:0%
way to get to yes on this bill so my
 
04:01:33.389 --> 04:01:33.399 align:start position:0%
question is a fairly basic one and maybe
 
04:01:35.429 --> 04:01:35.439 align:start position:0%
you can explain it to me because I'm I'm
 
04:01:38.550 --> 04:01:38.560 align:start position:0%
missing something here let's say let's
 
04:01:40.710 --> 04:01:40.720 align:start position:0%
say I'm at loggerheads with the town of
 
04:01:43.990 --> 04:01:44.000 align:start position:0%
West Milan on getting some information
 
04:01:47.349 --> 04:01:47.359 align:start position:0%
right current route is I go to Superior
 
04:01:50.790 --> 04:01:50.800 align:start position:0%
Court cost me money in time that's right
 
04:01:53.790 --> 04:01:53.800 align:start position:0%
as best I can tell from this
 
04:01:57.149 --> 04:01:57.159 align:start position:0%
bill I could then go to an
 
04:01:59.469 --> 04:01:59.479 align:start position:0%
ombudsman and if the town is still
 
04:02:01.550 --> 04:02:01.560 align:start position:0%
resistant I'm back in Superior Court
 
04:02:03.269 --> 04:02:03.279 align:start position:0%
four months later spending the same
 
04:02:07.189 --> 04:02:07.199 align:start position:0%
amount of money four months later so or
 
04:02:10.070 --> 04:02:10.080 align:start position:0%
five months or whatever it is so where
 
04:02:12.790 --> 04:02:12.800 align:start position:0%
is the savings to me if I'm at
 
04:02:15.389 --> 04:02:15.399 align:start position:0%
loggerheads with the town it's just an
 
04:02:18.149 --> 04:02:18.159 align:start position:0%
extra step then
 
04:02:20.990 --> 04:02:21.000 align:start position:0%
that if if Superior Court starts the
 
04:02:23.429 --> 04:02:23.439 align:start position:0%
whole thing over again denovo which it
 
04:02:26.389 --> 04:02:26.399 align:start position:0%
does uh where's the
 
04:02:29.870 --> 04:02:29.880 align:start position:0%
savings well the savings is would be
 
04:02:32.750 --> 04:02:32.760 align:start position:0%
in the citizen not having to make the
 
04:02:35.790 --> 04:02:35.800 align:start position:0%
initial investment to get on the docket
 
04:02:38.670 --> 04:02:38.680 align:start position:0%
of superior court and and also the
 
04:02:42.349 --> 04:02:42.359 align:start position:0%
superior court docket is pretty busy um
 
04:02:42.359 --> 04:02:43.910 align:start position:0%
superior court docket is pretty busy um
and

04:02:43.910 --> 04:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:02:48.750 --> 04:02:48.760 align:start position:0%
so the time savings would be by running
 
04:02:52.870 --> 04:02:52.880 align:start position:0%
the issue by the um edsman and having
 
04:02:55.830 --> 04:02:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:59.070 --> 04:02:59.080 align:start position:0%
it okay thank you you're welcome thank
 
04:03:01.269 --> 04:03:01.279 align:start position:0%
you thank you for your
 
04:03:04.670 --> 04:03:04.680 align:start position:0%
question yes represent McAn so if I
 
04:03:07.750 --> 04:03:07.760 align:start position:0%
could just follow up then on represent
 
04:03:10.510 --> 04:03:10.520 align:start position:0%
vers question was there any thought
 
04:03:13.429 --> 04:03:13.439 align:start position:0%
given to the fact that maybe the
 
04:03:16.830 --> 04:03:16.840 align:start position:0%
legislation should uh have the force of
 
04:03:20.389 --> 04:03:20.399 align:start position:0%
law why why was why was that left out in
 
04:03:23.030 --> 04:03:23.040 align:start position:0%
other words that they come forth they
 
04:03:25.110 --> 04:03:25.120 align:start position:0%
can bring a decision it doesn't have the
 
04:03:26.790 --> 04:03:26.800 align:start position:0%
force of law was there a reason for
 
04:03:28.590 --> 04:03:28.600 align:start position:0%
having it that way
 
04:03:30.830 --> 04:03:30.840 align:start position:0%
repres I really don't know the answer to
 
04:03:34.269 --> 04:03:34.279 align:start position:0%
that question but I can speculate that
 
04:03:38.790 --> 04:03:38.800 align:start position:0%
at this point um the bill is
 
04:03:43.269 --> 04:03:43.279 align:start position:0%
it's new um it has a sunset Clause if
 
04:03:48.149 --> 04:03:48.159 align:start position:0%
it's not working um and so I think that
 
04:03:50.469 --> 04:03:50.479 align:start position:0%
eventually in time it could have the
 
04:03:52.189 --> 04:03:52.199 align:start position:0%
force of legislation if if the
 
04:03:55.910 --> 04:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
legislature found that um desirable but
 
04:03:58.590 --> 04:03:58.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:01.710 --> 04:04:01.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't thank you representative rice
 
04:04:05.830 --> 04:04:05.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um I really like
 
04:04:10.110 --> 04:04:10.120 align:start position:0%
the idea of this bill my concern is so
 
04:04:14.870 --> 04:04:14.880 align:start position:0%
in in one part it says to um compel
 
04:04:16.710 --> 04:04:16.720 align:start position:0%
interviews with
 
04:04:20.429 --> 04:04:20.439 align:start position:0%
parties but that again it has no force
 
04:04:22.670 --> 04:04:22.680 align:start position:0%
to be able to make someone come in and
 
04:04:25.590 --> 04:04:25.600 align:start position:0%
have an interview is that
 
04:04:28.349 --> 04:04:28.359 align:start position:0%
correct so it seems to me that we're
 
04:04:31.030 --> 04:04:31.040 align:start position:0%
just buting heads again the same way we
 
04:04:33.110 --> 04:04:33.120 align:start position:0%
have been trying to get these these
 
04:04:35.110 --> 04:04:35.120 align:start position:0%
right to know
 
04:04:39.950 --> 04:04:39.960 align:start position:0%
requests um done
 
04:04:42.510 --> 04:04:42.520 align:start position:0%
right um I'm not sure that I'm following
 
04:04:46.630 --> 04:04:46.640 align:start position:0%
you could you talk about um people being
 
04:04:50.469 --> 04:04:50.479 align:start position:0%
are being compelled to meet with the
 
04:04:54.189 --> 04:04:54.199 align:start position:0%
edsman it says in the bill it says
 
04:04:57.510 --> 04:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
compel interviews with the parties it
 
04:05:00.670 --> 04:05:00.680 align:start position:0%
says compel timely delivery of Records
 
04:05:03.750 --> 04:05:03.760 align:start position:0%
within a period not less
 
04:05:06.910 --> 04:05:06.920 align:start position:0%
than I I'm asking you what what
 
04:05:09.110 --> 04:05:09.120 align:start position:0%
Authority would they have to actually
 
04:05:12.550 --> 04:05:12.560 align:start position:0%
compel them to come is it just a request
 
04:05:14.710 --> 04:05:14.720 align:start position:0%
or is there any rule of law that can
 
04:05:17.870 --> 04:05:17.880 align:start position:0%
bring that for them to come
 
04:05:23.790 --> 04:05:23.800 align:start position:0%
in I think I'm sorry go on that's it
 
04:05:27.870 --> 04:05:27.880 align:start position:0%
okay well I see it as um once the
 
04:05:32.189 --> 04:05:32.199 align:start position:0%
citizen agrees to go into um sort of
 
04:05:36.870 --> 04:05:36.880 align:start position:0%
like arbitration with the hitsman
 
04:05:41.790 --> 04:05:41.800 align:start position:0%
then I think that in a in a spirit of
 
04:05:44.510 --> 04:05:44.520 align:start position:0%
cooperation then they would need to you
 
04:05:46.389 --> 04:05:46.399 align:start position:0%
know follow through with producing the
 
04:05:50.229 --> 04:05:50.239 align:start position:0%
documents or whatever the utsman
 
04:05:53.469 --> 04:05:53.479 align:start position:0%
request follow Mr chairman and I
 
04:05:54.670 --> 04:05:54.680 align:start position:0%
understand that the person that has
 
04:05:57.070 --> 04:05:57.080 align:start position:0%
filed the request would probably be more
 
04:05:59.469 --> 04:05:59.479 align:start position:0%
than happy to go in and call interviews
 
04:06:02.870 --> 04:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
I'm referring to the other side of the
 
04:06:06.710 --> 04:06:06.720 align:start position:0%
co oh I see out the right you know you
 
04:06:08.309 --> 04:06:08.319 align:start position:0%
know not giving out
 
04:06:11.269 --> 04:06:11.279 align:start position:0%
information how are they going to compel
 
04:06:15.189 --> 04:06:15.199 align:start position:0%
them to an interview when we can't even
 
04:06:18.790 --> 04:06:18.800 align:start position:0%
compel them to comply with the right to
 
04:06:18.800 --> 04:06:20.389 align:start position:0%
compel them to comply with the right to
no

04:06:20.389 --> 04:06:20.399 align:start position:0%
no
 
04:06:22.389 --> 04:06:22.399 align:start position:0%
request I really don't know the answer
 
04:06:24.630 --> 04:06:24.640 align:start position:0%
to your question maybe one of our
 
04:06:26.830 --> 04:06:26.840 align:start position:0%
Witnesses would be able to help you with
 
04:06:30.550 --> 04:06:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:32.229 --> 04:06:32.239 align:start position:0%
you there
 
04:06:34.630 --> 04:06:34.640 align:start position:0%
any do you have a
 
04:06:36.950 --> 04:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you Mr chairman thank
 
04:06:39.429 --> 04:06:39.439 align:start position:0%
you uh representative for taking my
 
04:06:42.990 --> 04:06:43.000 align:start position:0%
question um because this is going to be
 
04:06:46.269 --> 04:06:46.279 align:start position:0%
very new and the barrier to entry is
 
04:06:47.910 --> 04:06:47.920 align:start position:0%
going to be much
 
04:06:51.189 --> 04:06:51.199 align:start position:0%
lower um what what kind of Provisions or
 
04:06:53.389 --> 04:06:53.399 align:start position:0%
what uh what are we thinking about in
 
04:06:56.830 --> 04:06:56.840 align:start position:0%
terms of uh overwhelming the Ombudsman
 
04:07:00.070 --> 04:07:00.080 align:start position:0%
and uh the size of the office that's
 
04:07:01.750 --> 04:07:01.760 align:start position:0%
going to be needed what what kind of
 
04:07:04.110 --> 04:07:04.120 align:start position:0%
Staffing have uh has there been any
 
04:07:07.229 --> 04:07:07.239 align:start position:0%
Research into uh into those uh
 
04:07:10.349 --> 04:07:10.359 align:start position:0%
particular issues well we actually spoke
 
04:07:13.950 --> 04:07:13.960 align:start position:0%
with the um edsman for the state of
 
04:07:17.910 --> 04:07:17.920 align:start position:0%
Maine and she has been in office for
 
04:07:21.229 --> 04:07:21.239 align:start position:0%
about five or six years and so um
 
04:07:25.790 --> 04:07:25.800 align:start position:0%
initially when the main edsman position
 
04:07:29.229 --> 04:07:29.239 align:start position:0%
was first initiated um there was a
 
04:07:32.550 --> 04:07:32.560 align:start position:0%
flurry of request but
 
04:07:36.429 --> 04:07:36.439 align:start position:0%
um in her view they were
 
04:07:39.670 --> 04:07:39.680 align:start position:0%
manageable and and at this point after a
 
04:07:41.510 --> 04:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
number of years they've slowed down
 
04:07:44.630 --> 04:07:44.640 align:start position:0%
quite a bit and then as far as Staffing
 
04:07:48.309 --> 04:07:48.319 align:start position:0%
and um office
 
04:07:51.309 --> 04:07:51.319 align:start position:0%
space the secretary of state has offered
 
04:07:53.070 --> 04:07:53.080 align:start position:0%
space in his
 
04:07:58.109 --> 04:07:58.119 align:start position:0%
building um and the bill
 
04:08:02.269 --> 04:08:02.279 align:start position:0%
does ask for an appropriation for the
 
04:08:05.870 --> 04:08:05.880 align:start position:0%
salary so we think we've got it got it
 
04:08:09.590 --> 04:08:09.600 align:start position:0%
knocked there thank
 
04:08:12.070 --> 04:08:12.080 align:start position:0%

about the the um the impact of law or
 
04:09:09.149 --> 04:09:09.159 align:start position:0%
the enforcement capacity this doesn't
 
04:09:11.750 --> 04:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
have in in terms of law is it the
 
04:09:14.750 --> 04:09:14.760 align:start position:0%
expectations the Ombudsman would really
 
04:09:17.950 --> 04:09:17.960 align:start position:0%
um negotiate with the parties that are
 
04:09:20.309 --> 04:09:20.319 align:start position:0%
involved so that there's a a settlement
 
04:09:22.910 --> 04:09:22.920 align:start position:0%
that occurs before people get to feeling
 
04:09:24.710 --> 04:09:24.720 align:start position:0%
like they have to go to Superior Court
 
04:09:26.990 --> 04:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
and that the the um resolution of
 
04:09:30.229 --> 04:09:30.239 align:start position:0%
whatever the issues are uh occur
 
04:09:32.910 --> 04:09:32.920 align:start position:0%
beforehand that is the desire that's the
 
04:09:36.630 --> 04:09:36.640 align:start position:0%
why the bill was designed so yes thank

uh thank you I'm Cordell Johnston uh
 
04:10:46.070 --> 04:10:46.080 align:start position:0%
government Affairs Council for the New
 
04:10:47.790 --> 04:10:47.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Municipal
 
04:10:50.189 --> 04:10:50.199 align:start position:0%
Association and uh the municipal
 
04:10:52.030 --> 04:10:52.040 align:start position:0%
Association I guess I would say
 
04:10:56.269 --> 04:10:56.279 align:start position:0%
cautiously supports this bill um we
 
04:10:59.750 --> 04:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
agree with the goal of it which is to
 
04:11:02.189 --> 04:11:02.199 align:start position:0%
make resolution of right to
 
04:11:08.149 --> 04:11:08.159 align:start position:0%
noaw uh issues faster and cheaper we
 
04:11:11.429 --> 04:11:11.439 align:start position:0%
hope that it will be beneficial not only
 
04:11:14.229 --> 04:11:14.239 align:start position:0%
for those requesting uh making right to
 
04:11:17.670 --> 04:11:17.680 align:start position:0%
no requests or complaints but also for
 
04:11:20.349 --> 04:11:20.359 align:start position:0%
municipalities that um
 
04:11:22.950 --> 04:11:22.960 align:start position:0%
frequently are not sure how they should
 
04:11:25.429 --> 04:11:25.439 align:start position:0%
respond because the law is sometimes
 
04:11:28.950 --> 04:11:28.960 align:start position:0%
unclear and if they can get those issues
 
04:11:33.830 --> 04:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
resolved uh in a uh in a less formal
 
04:11:38.269 --> 04:11:38.279 align:start position:0%
process uh that should be beneficial to
 
04:11:42.269 --> 04:11:42.279 align:start position:0%
everyone um I I I say we cautiously
 
04:11:44.710 --> 04:11:44.720 align:start position:0%
support it because uh as representative
 
04:11:48.790 --> 04:11:48.800 align:start position:0%
dorenzo said it it's a new process and
 
04:11:51.229 --> 04:11:51.239 align:start position:0%
so no one can really be sure exactly how
 
04:11:53.229 --> 04:11:53.239 align:start position:0%
it will play out a lot of it will depend
 
04:11:55.990 --> 04:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
on the the competence and The
 
04:11:59.309 --> 04:11:59.319 align:start position:0%
credibility of whoever the Ombudsman
 
04:12:03.710 --> 04:12:03.720 align:start position:0%
is uh and so we we like the idea that it
 
04:12:06.269 --> 04:12:06.279 align:start position:0%
has a Sunset date so that it can be
 
04:12:09.189 --> 04:12:09.199 align:start position:0%
reviewed after a couple of years to see
 
04:12:11.309 --> 04:12:11.319 align:start position:0%
how it's
 
04:12:11.319 --> 04:12:13.990 align:start position:0%
how it's
working

04:12:13.990 --> 04:12:14.000 align:start position:0%
working
 
04:12:17.030 --> 04:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
um like to comment on on a couple of the
 
04:12:20.590 --> 04:12:20.600 align:start position:0%
questions that were asked repres chch
 
04:12:24.630 --> 04:12:24.640 align:start position:0%
asked where are the savings if the if
 
04:12:27.710 --> 04:12:27.720 align:start position:0%
the Ombudsman ombudsman's decision can
 
04:12:30.830 --> 04:12:30.840 align:start position:0%
be appealed to Superior Court and that
 
04:12:32.469 --> 04:12:32.479 align:start position:0%
that's a good point you could end up
 
04:12:36.590 --> 04:12:36.600 align:start position:0%
starting all over but uh I think what
 
04:12:38.950 --> 04:12:38.960 align:start position:0%
we're hoping is that the
 
04:12:42.030 --> 04:12:42.040 align:start position:0%
edsman will as I said be competent and
 
04:12:47.670 --> 04:12:47.680 align:start position:0%
credible and uh that that when he or she
 
04:12:51.550 --> 04:12:51.560 align:start position:0%
issues a decision that the parties will
 
04:12:55.790 --> 04:12:55.800 align:start position:0%
see that the decision make sense and
 
04:12:57.790 --> 04:12:57.800 align:start position:0%
most of the time will not appeal to
 
04:12:59.510 --> 04:12:59.520 align:start position:0%
appeal to Superior Court so that they
 
04:13:03.389 --> 04:13:03.399 align:start position:0%
won't have to incur those costs uh if if
 
04:13:05.830 --> 04:13:05.840 align:start position:0%
if the Ombudsman is no good then then
 
04:13:07.429 --> 04:13:07.439 align:start position:0%
yeah you'll end up in Superior Court a
 
04:13:11.149 --> 04:13:11.159 align:start position:0%
lot but we're hoping that uh that that
 
04:13:14.070 --> 04:13:14.080 align:start position:0%
that will not be the case so ideally
 
04:13:16.950 --> 04:13:16.960 align:start position:0%
those those appeals would be avoided in
 
04:13:18.750 --> 04:13:18.760 align:start position:0%
most cases sure there are going to be
 
04:13:20.950 --> 04:13:20.960 align:start position:0%
complicated or contentious cases that
 
04:13:23.269 --> 04:13:23.279 align:start position:0%
will end up in Superior Court uh no
 
04:13:25.550 --> 04:13:25.560 align:start position:0%
matter what but I think that's always
 
04:13:27.630 --> 04:13:27.640 align:start position:0%
the case and then I think it was
 
04:13:29.910 --> 04:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
representative mlan asked a question
 
04:13:33.309 --> 04:13:33.319 align:start position:0%
about whether the ombudsman's decision
 
04:13:36.469 --> 04:13:36.479 align:start position:0%
would have the force of Law and I guess
 
04:13:39.630 --> 04:13:39.640 align:start position:0%
not exact ly sure
 
04:13:43.389 --> 04:13:43.399 align:start position:0%
um uh what what was meant by that but
 
04:13:45.630 --> 04:13:45.640 align:start position:0%
certainly the ombudsman's decision would
 
04:13:48.030 --> 04:13:48.040 align:start position:0%
be binding on the parties if it's not
 
04:13:52.950 --> 04:13:52.960 align:start position:0%
appealed on page three um line 27 it
 
04:13:55.109 --> 04:13:55.119 align:start position:0%
says the ombudsman's final rulings which
 
04:13:57.750 --> 04:13:57.760 align:start position:0%
are not appealed may be registered in
 
04:14:00.389 --> 04:14:00.399 align:start position:0%
the Superior Court as judgments and
 
04:14:03.109 --> 04:14:03.119 align:start position:0%
enforcable through contempt of court so
 
04:14:05.030 --> 04:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
if the Ombudsman orders a town to
 
04:14:07.389 --> 04:14:07.399 align:start position:0%
disclose some records and and the town
 
04:14:10.750 --> 04:14:10.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't appeal and doesn't disclose the
 
04:14:15.469 --> 04:14:15.479 align:start position:0%
records then the town's in trouble
 
04:14:20.830 --> 04:14:20.840 align:start position:0%
um what it would not be is um the the
 
04:14:23.429 --> 04:14:23.439 align:start position:0%
ombudsman's decisions would not have any
 
04:14:25.149 --> 04:14:25.159 align:start position:0%
precedential value they would not be
 
04:14:27.950 --> 04:14:27.960 align:start position:0%
binding in other cases they would they
 
04:14:30.149 --> 04:14:30.159 align:start position:0%
would only bind the parties to that
 
04:14:34.030 --> 04:14:34.040 align:start position:0%
particular case so uh it's just a
 
04:14:36.070 --> 04:14:36.080 align:start position:0%
there's a distinction
 
04:14:39.750 --> 04:14:39.760 align:start position:0%
there and I don't think I have anything
 
04:14:42.870 --> 04:14:42.880 align:start position:0%
more to say but I'd be happy to answer
 
04:14:45.030 --> 04:14:45.040 align:start position:0%
questions any
 
04:14:45.040 --> 04:14:50.070 align:start position:0%
questions any
questions

04:14:50.070 --> 04:14:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:52.670 --> 04:14:52.680 align:start position:0%

the state at as we are a
 
04:15:41.710 --> 04:15:41.720 align:start position:0%
resource citizens turn to when they feel
 
04:15:44.590 --> 04:15:44.600 align:start position:0%
their public officials may be violating
 
04:15:47.229 --> 04:15:47.239 align:start position:0%
the right to no law for each of the last
 
04:15:49.389 --> 04:15:49.399 align:start position:0%
four years we have averaged over 50
 
04:15:52.109 --> 04:15:52.119 align:start position:0%
inquiries which include complaints and
 
04:15:53.630 --> 04:15:53.640 align:start position:0%
requests for
 
04:15:56.030 --> 04:15:56.040 align:start position:0%
assistance some of the complaints we
 
04:15:58.910 --> 04:15:58.920 align:start position:0%
received were one a public body was not
 
04:16:01.550 --> 04:16:01.560 align:start position:0%
following the governor's executive order
 
04:16:05.429 --> 04:16:05.439 align:start position:0%
for remote electronic meetings two a
 
04:16:08.429 --> 04:16:08.439 align:start position:0%
superintendent quoted six months to fill
 
04:16:10.590 --> 04:16:10.600 align:start position:0%
a right to no request for
 
04:16:13.910 --> 04:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
records three a town was not properly
 
04:16:15.269 --> 04:16:15.279 align:start position:0%
posting meeting
 
04:16:18.149 --> 04:16:18.159 align:start position:0%
notices four a school board made a
 
04:16:19.990 --> 04:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
decision outside of a
 
04:16:22.910 --> 04:16:22.920 align:start position:0%
meeting five a conservation committee
 
04:16:25.189 --> 04:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
refused to provide access to records of
 
04:16:27.670 --> 04:16:27.680 align:start position:0%
proo proposed conservation
 
04:16:29.950 --> 04:16:29.960 align:start position:0%
easements each of these complaints could
 
04:16:31.429 --> 04:16:31.439 align:start position:0%
be addressed by an
 
04:16:34.189 --> 04:16:34.199 align:start position:0%
ombudsman however without an ombudsman
 
04:16:37.070 --> 04:16:37.080 align:start position:0%
they will most likely not be addressed
 
04:16:38.910 --> 04:16:38.920 align:start position:0%
as the individuals does not have the
 
04:16:42.429 --> 04:16:42.439 align:start position:0%
time M or expertise to seek redress of
 
04:16:42.439 --> 04:16:43.229 align:start position:0%
time M or expertise to seek redress of
their

04:16:43.229 --> 04:16:43.239 align:start position:0%
their
 
04:16:47.910 --> 04:16:47.920 align:start position:0%
grievance law in 2017 with the passage
 
04:16:50.309 --> 04:16:50.319 align:start position:0%
of House Bill
 
04:16:52.710 --> 04:16:52.720 align:start position:0%
178 um it established a commission to
 
04:16:55.750 --> 04:16:55.760 align:start position:0%
study processes to resolve right to no
 
04:16:58.910 --> 04:16:58.920 align:start position:0%
complaints after two months of hearings
 
04:17:01.710 --> 04:17:01.720 align:start position:0%
across represent representation of
 
04:17:04.309 --> 04:17:04.319 align:start position:0%
stakeholders unanimously agreed that a
 
04:17:11.630 --> 04:17:11.640 align:start position:0%
citizen needs a faster cheaper grievance
 
04:17:13.990 --> 04:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
process establishing an independent
 
04:17:16.149 --> 04:17:16.159 align:start position:0%
Ombudsman was the recommendation after
 
04:17:21.950 --> 04:17:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:25.309 --> 04:17:25.319 align:start position:0%
Alternatives I was one of the 13 members
 
04:17:27.750 --> 04:17:27.760 align:start position:0%
on that study commission I was also one
 
04:17:30.189 --> 04:17:30.199 align:start position:0%
of the members tasked with writing the
 
04:17:35.109 --> 04:17:35.119 align:start position:0%
study commission's final report which I
 
04:17:37.550 --> 04:17:37.560 align:start position:0%
hope all of you will read
 
04:17:39.790 --> 04:17:39.800 align:start position:0%
uh and I contributed to the drafting of
 
04:17:39.800 --> 04:17:41.950 align:start position:0%
uh and I contributed to the drafting of
this

04:17:41.950 --> 04:17:41.960 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:17:44.710 --> 04:17:44.720 align:start position:0%
bill in New Hampshire the deck is
 
04:17:47.030 --> 04:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
stacked against the citizen while on
 
04:17:48.550 --> 04:17:48.560 align:start position:0%
paper it appears that the right to no
 
04:17:50.349 --> 04:17:50.359 align:start position:0%
law provides an open and transparent
 
04:17:52.790 --> 04:17:52.800 align:start position:0%
government enforcement of this law Falls
 
04:17:55.269 --> 04:17:55.279 align:start position:0%
squarely on the back of the individual
 
04:17:57.910 --> 04:17:57.920 align:start position:0%
citizen who has the financial and
 
04:18:00.030 --> 04:18:00.040 align:start position:0%
emotional Capital to take their
 
04:18:02.030 --> 04:18:02.040 align:start position:0%
government to court to enforce their
 
04:18:04.790 --> 04:18:04.800 align:start position:0%
right to know most citizens simply do
 
04:18:07.510 --> 04:18:07.520 align:start position:0%
not have the time or money to fight for
 
04:18:09.429 --> 04:18:09.439 align:start position:0%
themselves and their fellow
 
04:18:12.510 --> 04:18:12.520 align:start position:0%
citizens public officials in some cases
 
04:18:14.670 --> 04:18:14.680 align:start position:0%
know this and use this barrier to their
 
04:18:16.630 --> 04:18:16.640 align:start position:0%
advantage as they violate the rights of
 
04:18:16.640 --> 04:18:17.429 align:start position:0%
advantage as they violate the rights of
all

04:18:17.429 --> 04:18:17.439 align:start position:0%
all
 
04:18:19.710 --> 04:18:19.720 align:start position:0%
citizens for each right to no petition
 
04:18:21.269 --> 04:18:21.279 align:start position:0%
filed in court there are many more
 
04:18:23.309 --> 04:18:23.319 align:start position:0%
violations which are not pursued by
 
04:18:25.710 --> 04:18:25.720 align:start position:0%
citizens because they cannot afford to
 
04:18:25.720 --> 04:18:26.910 align:start position:0%
citizens because they cannot afford to
do

04:18:26.910 --> 04:18:26.920 align:start position:0%
do
 
04:18:30.349 --> 04:18:30.359 align:start position:0%
so and when a citizen does go to court
 
04:18:32.550 --> 04:18:32.560 align:start position:0%
public officials use the Deep Pockets of
 
04:18:34.830 --> 04:18:34.840 align:start position:0%
taxpayer funding to fight against the
 
04:18:37.189 --> 04:18:37.199 align:start position:0%
very taxpayers who are paying their
 
04:18:40.550 --> 04:18:40.560 align:start position:0%
legal bills this bill creates a lowcost
 
04:18:42.870 --> 04:18:42.880 align:start position:0%
speedy incredible and impartial
 
04:18:45.070 --> 04:18:45.080 align:start position:0%
grievance resolution
 
04:18:50.469 --> 04:18:50.479 align:start position:0%
process um I would like to um respond to
 
04:18:52.550 --> 04:18:52.560 align:start position:0%
a question that was put forth previously
 
04:18:55.109 --> 04:18:55.119 align:start position:0%
about you know where are the savings
 
04:18:57.389 --> 04:18:57.399 align:start position:0%
with the on budsman this has come up a
 
04:19:01.070 --> 04:19:01.080 align:start position:0%
number of times um it has been very
 
04:19:02.830 --> 04:19:02.840 align:start position:0%
difficult we have tried as an
 
04:19:06.710 --> 04:19:06.720 align:start position:0%
organization to um identify the cost
 
04:19:08.950 --> 04:19:08.960 align:start position:0%
that have incurred by various public
 
04:19:14.149 --> 04:19:14.159 align:start position:0%
agencies uh as they um uh are incurring
 
04:19:17.030 --> 04:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
court costs and legal costs uh dealing
 
04:19:19.349 --> 04:19:19.359 align:start position:0%
with right to no issues
 
04:19:21.510 --> 04:19:21.520 align:start position:0%
unfortunately uh the response we've
 
04:19:25.309 --> 04:19:25.319 align:start position:0%
received from many uh public bodies is
 
04:19:29.030 --> 04:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
that uh they don't keep track of that
 
04:19:32.189 --> 04:19:32.199 align:start position:0%
information separately their legal
 
04:19:33.990 --> 04:19:34.000 align:start position:0%
resources that they have at their
 
04:19:37.830 --> 04:19:37.840 align:start position:0%
disposal um don't break out uh the the
 
04:19:39.950 --> 04:19:39.960 align:start position:0%
time or cost for right to know issues
 
04:19:43.389 --> 04:19:43.399 align:start position:0%
versus non-ri to know issues I can say
 
04:19:45.510 --> 04:19:45.520 align:start position:0%
from my experience as president of right
 
04:19:48.429 --> 04:19:48.439 align:start position:0%
to know New Hampshire and dealing with
 
04:19:50.070 --> 04:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
uh complaints that have come into our
 
04:19:54.189 --> 04:19:54.199 align:start position:0%
organization over the last uh five plus
 
04:19:58.750 --> 04:19:58.760 align:start position:0%
years that um there are many complaints
 
04:20:00.910 --> 04:20:00.920 align:start position:0%
that never make it to
 
04:20:03.910 --> 04:20:03.920 align:start position:0%
court uh and that will continue to be
 
04:20:08.590 --> 04:20:08.600 align:start position:0%
the case until we establish some form of
 
04:20:12.349 --> 04:20:12.359 align:start position:0%
independent uh Arbiter that uh allows
 
04:20:17.309 --> 04:20:17.319 align:start position:0%
the citizen at minimal cost to file uh
 
04:20:19.710 --> 04:20:19.720 align:start position:0%
and get resolution of a right to no
 
04:20:22.149 --> 04:20:22.159 align:start position:0%
grievance thank you very much for your
 
04:20:25.309 --> 04:20:25.319 align:start position:0%
time thank you and are there questions
 
04:20:30.189 --> 04:20:30.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:30.199 --> 04:20:32.309 align:start position:0%
 
sad

04:20:32.309 --> 04:20:32.319 align:start position:0%
sad
 
04:20:34.389 --> 04:20:34.399 align:start position:0%
represent representative
 
04:20:36.750 --> 04:20:36.760 align:start position:0%
syia thank you Mr chairman thank you you
 
04:20:40.309 --> 04:20:40.319 align:start position:0%
Mr sad for taking my question um it
 
04:20:42.790 --> 04:20:42.800 align:start position:0%
seems to me that the
 
04:20:46.309 --> 04:20:46.319 align:start position:0%
difficulties with uh enforcing right to
 
04:20:50.149 --> 04:20:50.159 align:start position:0%
know as it is now is a weakness in the
 
04:20:52.990 --> 04:20:53.000 align:start position:0%
right to no
 
04:20:55.510 --> 04:20:55.520 align:start position:0%
law why would
 
04:20:59.349 --> 04:20:59.359 align:start position:0%
we build a new government
 
04:21:04.510 --> 04:21:04.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:07.870 --> 04:21:07.880 align:start position:0%
problem well within the right to no law
 
04:21:09.750 --> 04:21:09.760 align:start position:0%
as it currently exists there is a
 
04:21:10.950 --> 04:21:10.960 align:start position:0%
section on
 
04:21:15.910 --> 04:21:15.920 align:start position:0%
remedies and uh those remedies uh are
 
04:21:18.309 --> 04:21:18.319 align:start position:0%
available to the citizen however those
 
04:21:22.109 --> 04:21:22.119 align:start position:0%
remedies require that the citizen file a
 
04:21:24.830 --> 04:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
petition uh in Superior Court and as
 
04:21:26.349 --> 04:21:26.359 align:start position:0%
I've mentioned that's a very timec
 
04:21:29.910 --> 04:21:29.920 align:start position:0%
consuming costly um proposition for the
 
04:21:32.870 --> 04:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
average citizen the bill for the
 
04:21:36.670 --> 04:21:36.680 align:start position:0%
Ombudsman has included in its language
 
04:21:40.149 --> 04:21:40.159 align:start position:0%
um the um ability for the Ombudsman to
 
04:21:44.109 --> 04:21:44.119 align:start position:0%
make a ruling on any uh right to know
 
04:21:47.030 --> 04:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
complaint and can order any of the
 
04:21:49.710 --> 04:21:49.720 align:start position:0%
remedies that are outlined in that
 
04:21:53.950 --> 04:21:53.960 align:start position:0%
section um so the Ombudsman can make uh
 
04:21:57.630 --> 04:21:57.640 align:start position:0%
an order uh and a ruling to offer up the
 
04:21:57.640 --> 04:21:58.469 align:start position:0%
an order uh and a ruling to offer up the
same

04:21:58.469 --> 04:21:58.479 align:start position:0%
same
 
04:22:02.309 --> 04:22:02.319 align:start position:0%
remedies that the citizen would get by
 
04:22:05.349 --> 04:22:05.359 align:start position:0%
filing a petition in court um
 
04:22:05.359 --> 04:22:06.910 align:start position:0%
filing a petition in court um
additionally

04:22:06.910 --> 04:22:06.920 align:start position:0%
additionally
 
04:22:09.149 --> 04:22:09.159 align:start position:0%
um if
 
04:22:13.229 --> 04:22:13.239 align:start position:0%
the if the citizen or the public body um
 
04:22:16.189 --> 04:22:16.199 align:start position:0%
chose to appeal the ombudsman's decision
 
04:22:21.189 --> 04:22:21.199 align:start position:0%
to court which uh again it we we hope
 
04:22:24.630 --> 04:22:24.640 align:start position:0%
will be few instances of that happening
 
04:22:29.710 --> 04:22:29.720 align:start position:0%
but if they do the the citizen has the
 
04:22:31.630 --> 04:22:31.640 align:start position:0%
added benefit of not having to pay a
 
04:22:31.640 --> 04:22:32.590 align:start position:0%
added benefit of not having to pay a
filing

04:22:32.590 --> 04:22:32.600 align:start position:0%
filing
 
04:22:36.469 --> 04:22:36.479 align:start position:0%
fee um to do so and second that the
 
04:22:40.950 --> 04:22:40.960 align:start position:0%
budman's ruling would be um attached to
 
04:22:44.030 --> 04:22:44.040 align:start position:0%
the petition uh and the judge would have
 
04:22:46.030 --> 04:22:46.040 align:start position:0%
to address the issues that are raised by
 
04:22:49.830 --> 04:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
the Ombudsman um during the ruling that
 
04:22:53.189 --> 04:22:53.199 align:start position:0%
they would make uh as part of that court
 
04:22:57.870 --> 04:22:57.880 align:start position:0%
process um so uh I think there's a
 
04:23:00.429 --> 04:23:00.439 align:start position:0%
there's not really uh while there's been
 
04:23:03.070 --> 04:23:03.080 align:start position:0%
some argument in past that the remedy
 
04:23:05.389 --> 04:23:05.399 align:start position:0%
section of the law could be improved
 
04:23:08.389 --> 04:23:08.399 align:start position:0%
upon um and I think that that's a bill
 
04:23:12.670 --> 04:23:12.680 align:start position:0%
for a future time um the benefit is that
 
04:23:14.910 --> 04:23:14.920 align:start position:0%
they would be able to uh get the same
 
04:23:16.510 --> 04:23:16.520 align:start position:0%
remedies that they can get by going to
 
04:23:18.590 --> 04:23:18.600 align:start position:0%
court followup Mr
 
04:23:22.630 --> 04:23:22.640 align:start position:0%
chair go ahead so you spoke of this
 
04:23:25.550 --> 04:23:25.560 align:start position:0%
Ombudsman as being an impartial
 
04:23:29.590 --> 04:23:29.600 align:start position:0%
arbitrator so to speak um when I look at
 
04:23:31.269 --> 04:23:31.279 align:start position:0%
things I see citizens against the
 
04:23:33.750 --> 04:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
government and uh this is just another
 
04:23:36.630 --> 04:23:36.640 align:start position:0%
government entity that the citizen is uh
 
04:23:38.590 --> 04:23:38.600 align:start position:0%
going up against and that makes it two
 
04:23:41.990 --> 04:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
to one do you not
 
04:23:44.189 --> 04:23:44.199 align:start position:0%
agree um
 
04:23:44.199 --> 04:23:45.950 align:start position:0%
agree um
I

04:23:45.950 --> 04:23:45.960 align:start position:0%
I
 
04:23:49.510 --> 04:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
uh I I I agree that that possibility
 
04:23:51.870 --> 04:23:51.880 align:start position:0%
exists and I think there was a lot of
 
04:23:53.750 --> 04:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
effort that we put into when we had the
 
04:23:56.189 --> 04:23:56.199 align:start position:0%
study commission one of the topics that
 
04:23:58.469 --> 04:23:58.479 align:start position:0%
came up is where was this office of
 
04:24:01.149 --> 04:24:01.159 align:start position:0%
edsman going to be located there were
 
04:24:03.109 --> 04:24:03.119 align:start position:0%
some that suggested the Department of
 
04:24:05.590 --> 04:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
Justice For example uh we had a lot of
 
04:24:07.149 --> 04:24:07.159 align:start position:0%
discussions at that time about where
 
04:24:10.510 --> 04:24:10.520 align:start position:0%
should it be located and it was decided
 
04:24:13.670 --> 04:24:13.680 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state would provide the
 
04:24:16.870 --> 04:24:16.880 align:start position:0%
least uh be the location that would
 
04:24:19.870 --> 04:24:19.880 align:start position:0%
offer up the least conflict of interest
 
04:24:22.790 --> 04:24:22.800 align:start position:0%
um where the citizens may not get you
 
04:24:25.590 --> 04:24:25.600 align:start position:0%
know a fair Shake um I think your
 
04:24:28.750 --> 04:24:28.760 align:start position:0%
concerns there's some um you know that
 
04:24:32.070 --> 04:24:32.080 align:start position:0%
it's it's a valid concern um but I would
 
04:24:35.670 --> 04:24:35.680 align:start position:0%
not um uh I would I would like to be
 
04:24:38.109 --> 04:24:38.119 align:start position:0%
optimistic in the thought that this is
 
04:24:40.429 --> 04:24:40.439 align:start position:0%
going to take us a long way towards the
 
04:24:44.269 --> 04:24:44.279 align:start position:0%
goal of making a grievance process you
 
04:24:46.429 --> 04:24:46.439 align:start position:0%
know fast easy and cheap for the
 
04:24:51.990 --> 04:24:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:55.229 --> 04:24:55.239 align:start position:0%
bur thank you Mr chair and thank you as
 
04:24:58.990 --> 04:24:59.000 align:start position:0%
always uh Mr sad you educate me year
 
04:25:02.269 --> 04:25:02.279 align:start position:0%
after year and I appreciate that
 
04:25:05.109 --> 04:25:05.119 align:start position:0%
um a question that was asked earlier I
 
04:25:11.790 --> 04:25:11.800 align:start position:0%
want to uh revisit and that is the uh
 
04:25:14.070 --> 04:25:14.080 align:start position:0%
the process
 
04:25:17.790 --> 04:25:17.800 align:start position:0%
involves compulsion of bringing
 
04:25:20.149 --> 04:25:20.159 align:start position:0%
in uh
 
04:25:23.830 --> 04:25:23.840 align:start position:0%
mandatorily uh the other side documents
 
04:25:26.229 --> 04:25:26.239 align:start position:0%
and the like they use the word compel
 
04:25:28.830 --> 04:25:28.840 align:start position:0%
timely delivery of Records there's no
 
04:25:32.109 --> 04:25:32.119 align:start position:0%
limitation on what records can be um
 
04:25:33.670 --> 04:25:33.680 align:start position:0%
requested whether they're relevant
 
04:25:35.670 --> 04:25:35.680 align:start position:0%
records whether somebody might oppose
 
04:25:37.309 --> 04:25:37.319 align:start position:0%
them they might be confidential they
 
04:25:39.870 --> 04:25:39.880 align:start position:0%
might have juvenile information who
 
04:25:42.830 --> 04:25:42.840 align:start position:0%
knows uh and then compel interviews with
 
04:25:45.870 --> 04:25:45.880 align:start position:0%
the parties how do you Vision that
 
04:25:49.349 --> 04:25:49.359 align:start position:0%
compulsion being done uh by subpoena
 
04:25:53.830 --> 04:25:53.840 align:start position:0%
court order um by how are you thinking
 
04:25:58.950 --> 04:25:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:04.349 --> 04:26:04.359 align:start position:0%
in uh as I as I think you know is having
 
04:26:08.550 --> 04:26:08.560 align:start position:0%
read the um the bill um it does not
 
04:26:11.830 --> 04:26:11.840 align:start position:0%
provide the level of details around what
 
04:26:14.550 --> 04:26:14.560 align:start position:0%
will be done to compel and again this is
 
04:26:16.670 --> 04:26:16.680 align:start position:0%
an area we had discussions during the
 
04:26:20.790 --> 04:26:20.800 align:start position:0%
commission uh about that topic um the
 
04:26:26.870 --> 04:26:26.880 align:start position:0%
the key here is that um both parties um
 
04:26:30.030 --> 04:26:30.040 align:start position:0%
are going to be compelled to provide the
 
04:26:31.510 --> 04:26:31.520 align:start position:0%
on budsman with the necessary
 
04:26:35.309 --> 04:26:35.319 align:start position:0%
information so that they can so that uh
 
04:26:37.910 --> 04:26:37.920 align:start position:0%
that uh Ombudsman can can make the the
 
04:26:43.189 --> 04:26:43.199 align:start position:0%
proper ruling of course um if they if
 
04:26:46.149 --> 04:26:46.159 align:start position:0%
either side chooses not to
 
04:26:50.550 --> 04:26:50.560 align:start position:0%
comply um then we also have in the bill
 
04:26:53.790 --> 04:26:53.800 align:start position:0%
language that allows the on budsman to
 
04:26:55.189 --> 04:26:55.199 align:start position:0%
draw a
 
04:26:57.750 --> 04:26:57.760 align:start position:0%
negative inference from A party's
 
04:27:00.070 --> 04:27:00.080 align:start position:0%
failure to participate and comply with
 
04:27:00.080 --> 04:27:00.910 align:start position:0%
failure to participate and comply with
the

04:27:00.910 --> 04:27:00.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:27:04.630 --> 04:27:04.640 align:start position:0%
orders Rie process so the resolution for
 
04:27:06.830 --> 04:27:06.840 align:start position:0%
the Ombudsman although they
 
04:27:10.269 --> 04:27:10.279 align:start position:0%
can't um Force asai to
 
04:27:14.109 --> 04:27:14.119 align:start position:0%
compel uh and with the the process if
 
04:27:17.070 --> 04:27:17.080 align:start position:0%
they fail to
 
04:27:21.070 --> 04:27:21.080 align:start position:0%
um uh participate and comply with the
 
04:27:23.910 --> 04:27:23.920 align:start position:0%
ombudsman's orders then the um budsman
 
04:27:26.389 --> 04:27:26.399 align:start position:0%
will draw a negative inference and make
 
04:27:28.750 --> 04:27:28.760 align:start position:0%
a ruling based upon that negative
 
04:27:31.910 --> 04:27:31.920 align:start position:0%
inference and I think that's a very fair
 
04:27:35.670 --> 04:27:35.680 align:start position:0%
thing to do uh if either the citizen who
 
04:27:38.510 --> 04:27:38.520 align:start position:0%
had made the complaint or the public
 
04:27:43.109 --> 04:27:43.119 align:start position:0%
body which is uh the subject of the
 
04:27:48.429 --> 04:27:48.439 align:start position:0%
complaint doesn't wanna um help resolve
 
04:27:53.429 --> 04:27:53.439 align:start position:0%
that problem um then that can be taken
 
04:27:56.109 --> 04:27:56.119 align:start position:0%
as a negative um
 
04:27:58.510 --> 04:27:58.520 align:start position:0%
inference if if I could just briefly
 
04:28:02.550 --> 04:28:02.560 align:start position:0%
follow up uh what what if the town says
 
04:28:06.590 --> 04:28:06.600 align:start position:0%
you want document number 23 and it from
 
04:28:09.750 --> 04:28:09.760 align:start position:0%
our perspective uh under law that's a
 
04:28:11.870 --> 04:28:11.880 align:start position:0%
privileged document or a confidential
 
04:28:15.149 --> 04:28:15.159 align:start position:0%
document and it will cause um a
 
04:28:17.469 --> 04:28:17.479 align:start position:0%
violation of state law to turn it over
 
04:28:20.670 --> 04:28:20.680 align:start position:0%
or or some other grounds there's no way
 
04:28:24.309 --> 04:28:24.319 align:start position:0%
in this to appeal I mean either you you
 
04:28:26.030 --> 04:28:26.040 align:start position:0%
uh refuse to turn it over and get a
 
04:28:28.349 --> 04:28:28.359 align:start position:0%
negative inference or you're forced to
 
04:28:30.309 --> 04:28:30.319 align:start position:0%
turn over something that may be improper
 
04:28:33.030 --> 04:28:33.040 align:start position:0%
to turn over um do you think that needs
 
04:28:34.269 --> 04:28:34.279 align:start position:0%
a little more
 
04:28:39.429 --> 04:28:39.439 align:start position:0%
work uh no I don't um and again there's
 
04:28:42.229 --> 04:28:42.239 align:start position:0%
language in the bill that addresses that
 
04:28:49.469 --> 04:28:49.479 align:start position:0%
um first of all we have excluded from uh
 
04:28:53.510 --> 04:28:53.520 align:start position:0%
uh uh the ability of a citizen to file a
 
04:28:55.349 --> 04:28:55.359 align:start position:0%
right to no request to gain access to
 
04:28:58.750 --> 04:28:58.760 align:start position:0%
any documents which are confidential so
 
04:29:00.830 --> 04:29:00.840 align:start position:0%
even though they're provided to the
 
04:29:03.630 --> 04:29:03.640 align:start position:0%
ombudsman the Ombudsman has to maintain
 
04:29:07.950 --> 04:29:07.960 align:start position:0%
any confidentiality will review those
 
04:29:11.630 --> 04:29:11.640 align:start position:0%
documents um sort of uh in camera like a
 
04:29:15.790 --> 04:29:15.800 align:start position:0%
court would um and then upon completion
 
04:29:19.670 --> 04:29:19.680 align:start position:0%
of their review uh and their ruling they
 
04:29:23.750 --> 04:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
will return those documents to the uh
 
04:29:26.830 --> 04:29:26.840 align:start position:0%
the public body that provided them and
 
04:29:29.030 --> 04:29:29.040 align:start position:0%
while they're in the possession of the
 
04:29:32.070 --> 04:29:32.080 align:start position:0%
Ombudsman uh no one uh they do not have
 
04:29:34.670 --> 04:29:34.680 align:start position:0%
to be provided to anyone else under RSA
 
04:29:37.870 --> 04:29:37.880 align:start position:0%
91a that inclusion is in this
 
04:29:40.269 --> 04:29:40.279 align:start position:0%
bill all right thank
 
04:29:43.109 --> 04:29:43.119 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
04:29:46.830 --> 04:29:46.840 align:start position:0%
Morgan thank you very much Mr chair Mike
 
04:29:48.590 --> 04:29:48.600 align:start position:0%
um I don't know whether you've answered
 
04:29:52.349 --> 04:29:52.359 align:start position:0%
to this to but how is the uh theam
 
04:29:54.510 --> 04:29:54.520 align:start position:0%
buzzin himself or herself and her her
 
04:29:56.149 --> 04:29:56.159 align:start position:0%
office would have to be subed the right
 
04:29:58.429 --> 04:29:58.439 align:start position:0%
to no law so what what happens if
 
04:30:00.750 --> 04:30:00.760 align:start position:0%
somebody BS a right to know request
 
04:30:03.630 --> 04:30:03.640 align:start position:0%
about the EMB budman's office Andor I
 
04:30:05.950 --> 04:30:05.960 align:start position:0%
assume sometimes two people will file
 
04:30:07.870 --> 04:30:07.880 align:start position:0%
peti the um budsman and turned them down
 
04:30:09.429 --> 04:30:09.439 align:start position:0%
and then that'll become like one more
 
04:30:11.389 --> 04:30:11.399 align:start position:0%
issue in the long running dispute that
 
04:30:13.670 --> 04:30:13.680 align:start position:0%
you know needs to be subed the right to
 
04:30:15.990 --> 04:30:16.000 align:start position:0%
know so we find out why the udman really
 
04:30:17.830 --> 04:30:17.840 align:start position:0%
made the decision they made so what how
 
04:30:19.750 --> 04:30:19.760 align:start position:0%
does how's the
 
04:30:22.910 --> 04:30:22.920 align:start position:0%
utsman and is or her office covered by
 
04:30:25.149 --> 04:30:25.159 align:start position:0%
91a themselves in case there's a right
 
04:30:31.070 --> 04:30:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:34.109 --> 04:30:34.119 align:start position:0%
office um well the hearings that the
 
04:30:39.149 --> 04:30:39.159 align:start position:0%
Ombudsman would hold if they are needed
 
04:30:41.550 --> 04:30:41.560 align:start position:0%
um are subject to
 
04:30:46.149 --> 04:30:46.159 align:start position:0%
91a and uh the records um with the
 
04:30:48.510 --> 04:30:48.520 align:start position:0%
exception that I mentioned in the in in
 
04:30:51.750 --> 04:30:51.760 align:start position:0%
answering the previous question um
 
04:30:54.550 --> 04:30:54.560 align:start position:0%
General uh records of the on budsman
 
04:30:56.349 --> 04:30:56.359 align:start position:0%
themselves such as complaints that were
 
04:30:59.590 --> 04:30:59.600 align:start position:0%
filed and the like would be available
 
04:30:59.600 --> 04:31:00.389 align:start position:0%
filed and the like would be available
under

04:31:00.389 --> 04:31:00.399 align:start position:0%
under
 
04:31:03.550 --> 04:31:03.560 align:start position:0%
91a uh so you know it is possible people
 
04:31:06.790 --> 04:31:06.800 align:start position:0%
could request access to that information
 
04:31:10.429 --> 04:31:10.439 align:start position:0%
um I think that's like any government
 
04:31:14.309 --> 04:31:14.319 align:start position:0%
agency uh you know we need that openness
 
04:31:17.109 --> 04:31:17.119 align:start position:0%
and transparency and so I think that's a
 
04:31:19.149 --> 04:31:19.159 align:start position:0%
good thing but yet we've built in the
 
04:31:21.469 --> 04:31:21.479 align:start position:0%
language to make sure that any
 
04:31:25.429 --> 04:31:25.439 align:start position:0%
confidential um exempt records that
 
04:31:27.590 --> 04:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
would not normally be disclosed under
 
04:31:32.870 --> 04:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
91a can't in in in some other manner be
 
04:31:38.469 --> 04:31:38.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:42.070 --> 04:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
follow Mr chair um the other issue is
 
04:31:45.229 --> 04:31:45.239 align:start position:0%
what happens can I ask to follow up Mr
 
04:31:48.309 --> 04:31:48.319 align:start position:0%
chair go go ahead repres oh thank you
 
04:31:51.229 --> 04:31:51.239 align:start position:0%
very much Mr chair so Mr sad what
 
04:31:53.670 --> 04:31:53.680 align:start position:0%
also maybe there's some general
 
04:31:54.950 --> 04:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
Provisions that would apply but I don't
 
04:31:56.349 --> 04:31:56.359 align:start position:0%
see anything here about what to do if
 
04:31:59.269 --> 04:31:59.279 align:start position:0%
Deon budman has a conflict of interest
 
04:32:01.149 --> 04:32:01.159 align:start position:0%
say if they've worked in the past for
 
04:32:02.990 --> 04:32:03.000 align:start position:0%
the public body if that's a subject of
 
04:32:05.750 --> 04:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
the uh of the request so obviously
 
04:32:07.469 --> 04:32:07.479 align:start position:0%
whatever the decision they made
 
04:32:09.030 --> 04:32:09.040 align:start position:0%
situation like that would obvious be at
 
04:32:11.030 --> 04:32:11.040 align:start position:0%
least colored by at least the suspicion
 
04:32:12.590 --> 04:32:12.600 align:start position:0%
that they were favoring their former
 
04:32:15.349 --> 04:32:15.359 align:start position:0%
employer so um is there any what
 
04:32:17.070 --> 04:32:17.080 align:start position:0%
provision is there for an ombudsman to
 
04:32:19.149 --> 04:32:19.159 align:start position:0%
step aside and have an acting Ombudsman
 
04:32:19.159 --> 04:32:20.389 align:start position:0%
step aside and have an acting Ombudsman
when

04:32:20.389 --> 04:32:20.399 align:start position:0%
when
 
04:32:23.389 --> 04:32:23.399 align:start position:0%
needed uh there's nothing in the the
 
04:32:28.109 --> 04:32:28.119 align:start position:0%
language to um that provides for you
 
04:32:32.070 --> 04:32:32.080 align:start position:0%
know a second or or tertiary person to
 
04:32:33.750 --> 04:32:33.760 align:start position:0%
fill in for that
 
04:32:36.109 --> 04:32:36.119 align:start position:0%
role um
 
04:32:38.309 --> 04:32:38.319 align:start position:0%
of course if the citizen felt that the
 
04:32:40.510 --> 04:32:40.520 align:start position:0%
ruling by the
 
04:32:44.469 --> 04:32:44.479 align:start position:0%
Ombudsman um was unfair for reasons due
 
04:32:48.469 --> 04:32:48.479 align:start position:0%
to such as a conflict of interest um
 
04:32:52.229 --> 04:32:52.239 align:start position:0%
they still have preserved in this bill
 
04:32:57.309 --> 04:32:57.319 align:start position:0%
the full ability to go to court so um
 
04:33:00.550 --> 04:33:00.560 align:start position:0%
you know that options still exists and
 
04:33:02.349 --> 04:33:02.359 align:start position:0%
that could be used in the situation
 
04:33:04.869 --> 04:33:04.879 align:start position:0%
where a citizen felt that maybe there
 
04:33:06.590 --> 04:33:06.600 align:start position:0%
was a conflict of interest so the
 
04:33:09.990 --> 04:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
Ombudsman ruling was not fair um and
 
04:33:11.910 --> 04:33:11.920 align:start position:0%
that's how they would deal with
 
04:33:14.189 --> 04:33:14.199 align:start position:0%
that okay yeah thank thank you very much
 
04:33:16.910 --> 04:33:16.920 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you Mr sad so that
 
04:33:18.750 --> 04:33:18.760 align:start position:0%
that's all the questions I have for Mr
 
04:33:22.949 --> 04:33:22.959 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:25.949 --> 04:33:25.959 align:start position:0%
Mr seeing none thank you Mr sad thank

that
 
04:33:49.949 --> 04:33:49.959 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:55.029 --> 04:33:55.039 align:start position:0%
gy hi this is Carla can you hear me good
 
04:33:57.349 --> 04:33:57.359 align:start position:0%
hi guys uh good afternoon honorable
 
04:33:59.310 --> 04:33:59.320 align:start position:0%
committee members thank you for uh
 
04:34:01.310 --> 04:34:01.320 align:start position:0%
giving me the opportunity to testify
 
04:34:05.390 --> 04:34:05.400 align:start position:0%
here today I'm here to ask you um I'm
 
04:34:07.150 --> 04:34:07.160 align:start position:0%
the former Republican state Senate
 
04:34:09.629 --> 04:34:09.639 align:start position:0%
candidate for District 20 I live in
 
04:34:12.150 --> 04:34:12.160 align:start position:0%
Manchester I'm an attorney by training
 
04:34:14.510 --> 04:34:14.520 align:start position:0%
and I serve on several nonprofit boards
 
04:34:16.670 --> 04:34:16.680 align:start position:0%
including right to know New Hampshire
 
04:34:19.230 --> 04:34:19.240 align:start position:0%
we're a nonpartisan Statewide citizens
 
04:34:21.310 --> 04:34:21.320 align:start position:0%
Coalition that works to improve
 
04:34:22.910 --> 04:34:22.920 align:start position:0%
government transparency and
 
04:34:25.189 --> 04:34:25.199 align:start position:0%
accountability as you guys just heard
 
04:34:28.150 --> 04:34:28.160 align:start position:0%
David said uh testified in support of
 
04:34:30.189 --> 04:34:30.199 align:start position:0%
this bill as well so I'm testifying in
 
04:34:34.390 --> 04:34:34.400 align:start position:0%
my personal capacity as a citizen um I
 
04:34:36.470 --> 04:34:36.480 align:start position:0%
think everyone here an agreement that
 
04:34:38.789 --> 04:34:38.799 align:start position:0%
this sounds like a generally pretty good
 
04:34:41.429 --> 04:34:41.439 align:start position:0%
idea uh New Hampshire generally does not
 
04:34:43.709 --> 04:34:43.719 align:start position:0%
rank as well as one would expect in
 
04:34:46.230 --> 04:34:46.240 align:start position:0%
terms of uh public integrity and public
 
04:34:49.029 --> 04:34:49.039 align:start position:0%
access to information so I think we
 
04:34:50.310 --> 04:34:50.320 align:start position:0%
understand there's a problem and we're
 
04:34:51.830 --> 04:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
trying to find a
 
04:34:55.429 --> 04:34:55.439 align:start position:0%
solution um I think the utzman I have to
 
04:34:57.750 --> 04:34:57.760 align:start position:0%
honestly say I was not a fan when we
 
04:34:59.990 --> 04:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
started out with this I think much like
 
04:35:03.269 --> 04:35:03.279 align:start position:0%
uh representative Sylvia I am skeptical
 
04:35:05.470 --> 04:35:05.480 align:start position:0%
when we grow government to try and solve
 
04:35:08.269 --> 04:35:08.279 align:start position:0%
a problem that already exists but I've
 
04:35:10.949 --> 04:35:10.959 align:start position:0%
come around to support this primarily
 
04:35:12.830 --> 04:35:12.840 align:start position:0%
for several reasons all the great
 
04:35:16.189 --> 04:35:16.199 align:start position:0%
reasons David just explained um in terms
 
04:35:18.189 --> 04:35:18.199 align:start position:0%
of what we think this bill can do
 
04:35:20.869 --> 04:35:20.879 align:start position:0%
obviously making things cheaper faster
 
04:35:23.990 --> 04:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
more accessible all that good stuff but
 
04:35:29.551 --> 04:35:29.561 align:start position:0%
also I think um it it it because of the
 
04:35:32.029 --> 04:35:32.039 align:start position:0%
sunset close if we figure out you know a
 
04:35:33.750 --> 04:35:33.760 align:start position:0%
couple of years down the line that this
 
04:35:36.150 --> 04:35:36.160 align:start position:0%
was not a great idea or or that it is
 
04:35:39.349 --> 04:35:39.359 align:start position:0%
indeed just creating more Hoops for a
 
04:35:41.750 --> 04:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
citizen to jump through then we can come
 
04:35:43.910 --> 04:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
back and we can tweak it I was really
 
04:35:45.470 --> 04:35:45.480 align:start position:0%
actually encouraged to hear that
 
04:35:49.109 --> 04:35:49.119 align:start position:0%
statement about the main um bootsman
 
04:35:51.949 --> 04:35:51.959 align:start position:0%
because I suspect something similar will
 
04:35:54.310 --> 04:35:54.320 align:start position:0%
happen here I did want to address
 
04:35:57.029 --> 04:35:57.039 align:start position:0%
something that um Cordell Johnson
 
04:35:59.470 --> 04:35:59.480 align:start position:0%
brought up you know I think with the
 
04:36:01.590 --> 04:36:01.600 align:start position:0%
municipalities a lot of times what's
 
04:36:03.750 --> 04:36:03.760 align:start position:0%
happening with right to know requests
 
04:36:05.429 --> 04:36:05.439 align:start position:0%
it's not so much that there's this
 
04:36:07.670 --> 04:36:07.680 align:start position:0%
pitting of of the citizen against the
 
04:36:10.070 --> 04:36:10.080 align:start position:0%
agency I think a lot of times it
 
04:36:12.349 --> 04:36:12.359 align:start position:0%
genuinely is people don't know what the
 
04:36:14.709 --> 04:36:14.719 align:start position:0%
right answer is anymore they don't know
 
04:36:16.310 --> 04:36:16.320 align:start position:0%
what they can disclose they're not sure
 
04:36:18.269 --> 04:36:18.279 align:start position:0%
what they're supposed to redact and when
 
04:36:20.269 --> 04:36:20.279 align:start position:0%
people are uncertain about things what
 
04:36:22.670 --> 04:36:22.680 align:start position:0%
tends to happen is as we all know if
 
04:36:24.510 --> 04:36:24.520 align:start position:0%
you're a parent you know it's just easy
 
04:36:26.590 --> 04:36:26.600 align:start position:0%
to say no and then to say because I said
 
04:36:29.789 --> 04:36:29.799 align:start position:0%
so so I think what the utzman can create
 
04:36:31.109 --> 04:36:31.119 align:start position:0%
here is an
 
04:36:34.709 --> 04:36:34.719 align:start position:0%
opportunity to actually help train the
 
04:36:37.349 --> 04:36:37.359 align:start position:0%
mun municipalities to instead of having
 
04:36:40.150 --> 04:36:40.160 align:start position:0%
that sort of fears Fear Factor of I
 
04:36:42.349 --> 04:36:42.359 align:start position:0%
don't know so I'm going to say no I
 
04:36:44.470 --> 04:36:44.480 align:start position:0%
think over a course of a couple of years
 
04:36:46.230 --> 04:36:46.240 align:start position:0%
we're going to see a decline in these
 
04:36:47.830 --> 04:36:47.840 align:start position:0%
requests because everyone's kind of
 
04:36:49.230 --> 04:36:49.240 align:start position:0%
going to know what they're supposed to
 
04:36:51.510 --> 04:36:51.520 align:start position:0%
do how they're supposed to redact what's
 
04:36:53.629 --> 04:36:53.639 align:start position:0%
important to redact and what we should
 
04:36:56.709 --> 04:36:56.719 align:start position:0%
be giving to our citizens under New
 
04:36:58.230 --> 04:36:58.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's very beautiful
 
04:37:00.429 --> 04:37:00.439 align:start position:0%
constitutional requirement that requires
 
04:37:02.510 --> 04:37:02.520 align:start position:0%
that our government should be open
 
04:37:06.109 --> 04:37:06.119 align:start position:0%
accessible transparent and respons
 
04:37:08.910 --> 04:37:08.920 align:start position:0%
to the people and so I feel like this is
 
04:37:11.349 --> 04:37:11.359 align:start position:0%
going to create that opportunity to
 
04:37:17.150 --> 04:37:17.160 align:start position:0%
actually be responsive to the people
 
04:37:20.269 --> 04:37:20.279 align:start position:0%
um I know there are costs involved as
 
04:37:22.470 --> 04:37:22.480 align:start position:0%
someone who's a small limited government
 
04:37:24.830 --> 04:37:24.840 align:start position:0%
kind of gal I'm not psyched about that
 
04:37:27.390 --> 04:37:27.400 align:start position:0%
but again I think if we start to compare
 
04:37:29.349 --> 04:37:29.359 align:start position:0%
what we are spending on right to no
 
04:37:31.230 --> 04:37:31.240 align:start position:0%
cases and I think we're going to see an
 
04:37:34.269 --> 04:37:34.279 align:start position:0%
acceleration of that um from a cost
 
04:37:36.869 --> 04:37:36.879 align:start position:0%
benefit anal analysis over time this is
 
04:37:40.390 --> 04:37:40.400 align:start position:0%
going to actually help us um I've been
 
04:37:42.269 --> 04:37:42.279 align:start position:0%
testifying on this bill for at least a
 
04:37:44.830 --> 04:37:44.840 align:start position:0%
couple of years that hearing and the
 
04:37:47.310 --> 04:37:47.320 align:start position:0%
task force took place in
 
04:37:49.910 --> 04:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
2017 that means we're looking at four or
 
04:37:52.551 --> 04:37:52.561 align:start position:0%
five years down the line I really want
 
04:37:56.189 --> 04:37:56.199 align:start position:0%
to encourage you to take this seriously
 
04:37:58.949 --> 04:37:58.959 align:start position:0%
move us in the right direction help us
 
04:38:02.349 --> 04:38:02.359 align:start position:0%
establish a cheap fast easy streamlined
 
04:38:05.670 --> 04:38:05.680 align:start position:0%
credible and impartial way to ensure
 
04:38:07.510 --> 04:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
that our government remains open
 
04:38:10.789 --> 04:38:10.799 align:start position:0%
accessible and account of to us um I'm
 
04:38:13.310 --> 04:38:13.320 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions you may
 
04:38:16.551 --> 04:38:16.561 align:start position:0%
have thank you representing
 
04:38:18.910 --> 04:38:18.920 align:start position:0%
syia thank you Miss Garrick for taking
 
04:38:18.920 --> 04:38:19.949 align:start position:0%
syia thank you Miss Garrick for taking
my

04:38:19.949 --> 04:38:19.959 align:start position:0%
my
 
04:38:21.910 --> 04:38:21.920 align:start position:0%
question how long would it take for you
 
04:38:24.949 --> 04:38:24.959 align:start position:0%
to list the government agencies that
 
04:38:27.470 --> 04:38:27.480 align:start position:0%
went away and I understand there is a
 
04:38:29.590 --> 04:38:29.600 align:start position:0%
sunset clause on this but how long would
 
04:38:29.600 --> 04:38:31.629 align:start position:0%
sunset clause on this but how long would
that

04:38:31.629 --> 04:38:31.639 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:38:36.789 --> 04:38:36.799 align:start position:0%
take not very probably zero
 
04:38:39.750 --> 04:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:43.869 --> 04:38:43.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:47.269 --> 04:38:47.279 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your testimony G
 
04:38:52.269 --> 04:38:52.279 align:start position:0%
thank you and we also have who signed up
 
04:38:53.910 --> 04:38:53.920 align:start position:0%
appears to have her hand raised is
 
04:39:03.830 --> 04:39:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:03.840 --> 04:39:05.349 align:start position:0%
 
Caden

04:39:05.349 --> 04:39:05.359 align:start position:0%
Caden
 
04:39:07.670 --> 04:39:07.680 align:start position:0%
it says I have to unmute I'm not
 
04:39:11.709 --> 04:39:11.719 align:start position:0%
familiar with this we can hear you thank
 
04:39:15.189 --> 04:39:15.199 align:start position:0%
you honorable committee for listening to
 
04:39:18.310 --> 04:39:18.320 align:start position:0%
me this very strange
 
04:39:23.510 --> 04:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
way I want to um say to representative
 
04:39:23.520 --> 04:39:24.789 align:start position:0%
way I want to um say to representative
Mike

04:39:24.789 --> 04:39:24.799 align:start position:0%
Mike
 
04:39:28.269 --> 04:39:28.279 align:start position:0%
Sylvia well it isn't in my
 
04:39:30.830 --> 04:39:30.840 align:start position:0%
responsibility to be able to make
 
04:39:33.869 --> 04:39:33.879 align:start position:0%
committees go away but maybe if the
 
04:39:37.390 --> 04:39:37.400 align:start position:0%
legislature did follow the Sunshine Bill
 
04:39:40.390 --> 04:39:40.400 align:start position:0%
they had they would start looking at
 
04:39:43.430 --> 04:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
what was necessary and what wasn't
 
04:39:46.230 --> 04:39:46.240 align:start position:0%
again that isn't something we've been
 
04:39:48.670 --> 04:39:48.680 align:start position:0%
able to do back
 
04:39:51.750 --> 04:39:51.760 align:start position:0%
to the bill we're
 
04:39:55.270 --> 04:39:55.280 align:start position:0%
on I would like to point out that the
 
04:39:58.070 --> 04:39:58.080 align:start position:0%
cost of having an on
 
04:40:02.190 --> 04:40:02.200 align:start position:0%
budsman will be minimal in comparison to
 
04:40:06.590 --> 04:40:06.600 align:start position:0%
the cost to the community's
 
04:40:10.110 --> 04:40:10.120 align:start position:0%
lawyers the courts having to be open for
 
04:40:14.510 --> 04:40:14.520 align:start position:0%
hearings letters and such sent by them
 
04:40:17.550 --> 04:40:17.560 align:start position:0%
and the sheriff's department delivering
 
04:40:20.788 --> 04:40:20.798 align:start position:0%
rits uh I know myself in the several
 
04:40:23.990 --> 04:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
right to know cases I have done as
 
04:40:27.270 --> 04:40:27.280 align:start position:0%
prosay the average cost would be around
 
04:40:33.390 --> 04:40:33.400 align:start position:0%
$750 to me and to my community around
 
04:40:38.270 --> 04:40:38.280 align:start position:0%
5,000 the Comm the utsman would allow
 
04:40:41.750 --> 04:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
for the community person who said no to
 
04:40:44.830 --> 04:40:44.840 align:start position:0%
a right to no request to appear and
 
04:40:48.110 --> 04:40:48.120 align:start position:0%
explain why they felt they couldn't give
 
04:40:51.030 --> 04:40:51.040 align:start position:0%
the information versus the communities
 
04:40:54.190 --> 04:40:54.200 align:start position:0%
having to hire a lawyer to go to court
 
04:40:56.788 --> 04:40:56.798 align:start position:0%
which is most often the
 
04:40:56.798 --> 04:40:58.510 align:start position:0%
which is most often the
answer

04:40:58.510 --> 04:40:58.520 align:start position:0%
answer
 
04:41:03.030 --> 04:41:03.040 align:start position:0%
secondly um the utsman
 
04:41:05.510 --> 04:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
office uh secretary of State Bill
 
04:41:09.510 --> 04:41:09.520 align:start position:0%
Gardner tells me he's had four or five
 
04:41:12.110 --> 04:41:12.120 align:start position:0%
that has said they would be willing to
 
04:41:12.120 --> 04:41:13.708 align:start position:0%
that has said they would be willing to
work

04:41:13.708 --> 04:41:13.718 align:start position:0%
work
 
04:41:17.070 --> 04:41:17.080 align:start position:0%
free as an ombudsman that would have to
 
04:41:19.430 --> 04:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
be taken into consideration on whether
 
04:41:21.990 --> 04:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
that would be allowed or
 
04:41:25.628 --> 04:41:25.638 align:start position:0%
not if there is an on budsman conflict
 
04:41:25.638 --> 04:41:26.788 align:start position:0%
not if there is an on budsman conflict
of

04:41:26.788 --> 04:41:26.798 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:41:31.628 --> 04:41:31.638 align:start position:0%
interest I assume we could set up a uh
 
04:41:35.230 --> 04:41:35.240 align:start position:0%
alternate for them to hear the case I
 
04:41:37.030 --> 04:41:37.040 align:start position:0%
don't see how it would be hard but I
 
04:41:38.948 --> 04:41:38.958 align:start position:0%
think the bill could have that addition
 
04:41:43.310 --> 04:41:43.320 align:start position:0%
to it if we've got other free
 
04:41:47.708 --> 04:41:47.718 align:start position:0%
services I have 50 years of experience
 
04:41:50.750 --> 04:41:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:53.910 --> 04:41:53.920 align:start position:0%
know I find that the majority of right
 
04:41:57.470 --> 04:41:57.480 align:start position:0%
to know problems occur because the
 
04:42:01.550 --> 04:42:01.560 align:start position:0%
53,000 plus employees of
 
04:42:05.830 --> 04:42:05.840 align:start position:0%
municipalities cities counties
 
04:42:09.750 --> 04:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
do not know their right to know if you
 
04:42:12.628 --> 04:42:12.638 align:start position:0%
look at the training done by
 
04:42:16.788 --> 04:42:16.798 align:start position:0%
nhma it averages about 1,500 of those
 
04:42:20.270 --> 04:42:20.280 align:start position:0%
53,000 plus employees that are members
 
04:42:23.430 --> 04:42:23.440 align:start position:0%
of the New Hampshire Municipal
 
04:42:28.750 --> 04:42:28.760 align:start position:0%
Association I have written to over 20
 
04:42:28.760 --> 04:42:29.868 align:start position:0%
Association I have written to over 20
state

04:42:29.868 --> 04:42:29.878 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:42:33.550 --> 04:42:33.560 align:start position:0%
agencies asking what they estimate they
 
04:42:36.230 --> 04:42:36.240 align:start position:0%
expend on right to no
 
04:42:38.510 --> 04:42:38.520 align:start position:0%
requests the one that shocked me the
 
04:42:41.230 --> 04:42:41.240 align:start position:0%
most was the Attorney General's office
 
04:42:44.070 --> 04:42:44.080 align:start position:0%
who must defend a state agency such as
 
04:42:47.628 --> 04:42:47.638 align:start position:0%
in Hawkins versus Health and Human
 
04:42:52.670 --> 04:42:52.680 align:start position:0%
Services or ATV and Dees there are
 
04:42:57.230 --> 04:42:57.240 align:start position:0%
several others but the Department of
 
04:43:00.788 --> 04:43:00.798 align:start position:0%
Transportation told me their average
 
04:43:04.788 --> 04:43:04.798 align:start position:0%
cost well they told me the actual cost
 
04:43:09.590 --> 04:43:09.600 align:start position:0%
19 for 2016 17 18 and
 
04:43:13.470 --> 04:43:13.480 align:start position:0%
19 and they had a cost of between 26,000
 
04:43:16.190 --> 04:43:16.200 align:start position:0%
and 31,000 each
 
04:43:21.510 --> 04:43:21.520 align:start position:0%
year so the state could incur savings by
 
04:43:24.270 --> 04:43:24.280 align:start position:0%
having this the Shocker was the Attorney
 
04:43:27.590 --> 04:43:27.600 align:start position:0%
General's office who told me they don't
 
04:43:31.910 --> 04:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
spend any cost well since the state law
 
04:43:33.910 --> 04:43:33.920 align:start position:0%
requires the Attorney General's office
 
04:43:35.190 --> 04:43:35.200 align:start position:0%
to defend
 
04:43:38.830 --> 04:43:38.840 align:start position:0%
agencies and I know they have I would
 
04:43:41.470 --> 04:43:41.480 align:start position:0%
assume they have spent money as in
 
04:43:41.480 --> 04:43:42.670 align:start position:0%
assume they have spent money as in

04:43:45.150 --> 04:43:45.160 align:start position:0%

04:43:48.958 --> 04:43:50.948 align:start position:0%
Services or ATV versus
Dees

04:43:50.948 --> 04:43:50.958 align:start position:0%
Dees
 
04:43:55.230 --> 04:43:55.240 align:start position:0%
um I think what I'd like to say the most
 
04:43:58.628 --> 04:43:58.638 align:start position:0%
is the legislature is charged by the
 
04:44:01.110 --> 04:44:01.120 align:start position:0%
Constitution with serving the citizens
 
04:44:03.390 --> 04:44:03.400 align:start position:0%
of the state through
 
04:44:03.400 --> 04:44:05.510 align:start position:0%
of the state through
representative

04:44:05.510 --> 04:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:44:09.470 --> 04:44:09.480 align:start position:0%
elections we send people to the
 
04:44:13.030 --> 04:44:13.040 align:start position:0%
legislature to represent the
 
04:44:16.190 --> 04:44:16.200 align:start position:0%
citizens to look
 
04:44:19.670 --> 04:44:19.680 align:start position:0%
at putting a law in place such as right
 
04:44:23.190 --> 04:44:23.200 align:start position:0%
to know and then leaving it to the
 
04:44:25.310 --> 04:44:25.320 align:start position:0%
citizens to
 
04:44:31.030 --> 04:44:31.040 align:start position:0%
enforce I believe has done half the job
 
04:44:32.070 --> 04:44:32.080 align:start position:0%
of it
 
04:44:34.430 --> 04:44:34.440 align:start position:0%
interpreting article 8 of the new
 
04:44:34.440 --> 04:44:38.270 align:start position:0%

Hampshire

04:44:38.270 --> 04:44:38.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:41.310 --> 04:44:41.320 align:start position:0%
Constitution I did write up testimony
 
04:44:45.030 --> 04:44:45.040 align:start position:0%
which if I can find in my computer where
 
04:44:50.788 --> 04:44:50.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:54.550 --> 04:44:54.560 align:start position:0%
you well thank you for your testimony
 
04:44:58.788 --> 04:44:58.798 align:start position:0%
today thank you hopefully this year you
 
04:45:00.628 --> 04:45:00.638 align:start position:0%
will pass
 
04:45:05.670 --> 04:45:05.680 align:start position:0%
it any questions for Miss Katie
 
04:45:07.750 --> 04:45:07.760 align:start position:0%
can you speak a little louder I'm having
 
04:45:09.830 --> 04:45:09.840 align:start position:0%
a hard time hearing and I've tried to
 
04:45:11.788 --> 04:45:11.798 align:start position:0%
increase the volume and I've got it as
 
04:45:15.948 --> 04:45:15.958 align:start position:0%
high as I can probably
 
04:45:20.350 --> 04:45:20.360 align:start position:0%
just so I will try
 
04:45:23.910 --> 04:45:23.920 align:start position:0%
to the are there any questions
 
04:45:26.590 --> 04:45:26.600 align:start position:0%
for Miss
 
04:45:30.110 --> 04:45:30.120 align:start position:0%
Katie seeing none thank
 
04:45:32.670 --> 04:45:32.680 align:start position:0%
you thank
 
04:45:38.230 --> 04:45:38.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:43.788 --> 04:45:43.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:50.110 --> 04:45:50.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:53.470 --> 04:45:53.480 align:start position:0%
head um thank you Mr chairman uh for the
 
04:45:54.990 --> 04:45:55.000 align:start position:0%
record my name is Richard HED I'm the
 
04:45:57.030 --> 04:45:57.040 align:start position:0%
government Affairs coordinator for the
 
04:45:59.350 --> 04:45:59.360 align:start position:0%
judicial branch uh and I apologize I
 
04:46:01.190 --> 04:46:01.200 align:start position:0%
must have messed up my registration to
 
04:46:04.470 --> 04:46:04.480 align:start position:0%
speak this this afternoon um uh on
 
04:46:06.230 --> 04:46:06.240 align:start position:0%
behalf of the judicial branch we do not
 
04:46:09.110 --> 04:46:09.120 align:start position:0%
take a position on this bill um but
 
04:46:12.070 --> 04:46:12.080 align:start position:0%
simply wanted to make a recommendation
 
04:46:13.750 --> 04:46:13.760 align:start position:0%
that the
 
04:46:17.230 --> 04:46:17.240 align:start position:0%
appeal um from the EMB budsman be
 
04:46:19.110 --> 04:46:19.120 align:start position:0%
directly to the Supreme Court rather
 
04:46:21.150 --> 04:46:21.160 align:start position:0%
than through the superior court with a
 
04:46:21.160 --> 04:46:22.110 align:start position:0%
than through the superior court with a
trial

04:46:22.110 --> 04:46:22.120 align:start position:0%
trial
 
04:46:24.948 --> 04:46:24.958 align:start position:0%
denovo um it seemed just in terms of
 
04:46:27.830 --> 04:46:27.840 align:start position:0%
resources and time that the goal was to
 
04:46:31.270 --> 04:46:31.280 align:start position:0%
speed up the process so if the party
 
04:46:33.350 --> 04:46:33.360 align:start position:0%
elects to go to the EMB budsman which is
 
04:46:35.430 --> 04:46:35.440 align:start position:0%
the process to elect to the beginning
 
04:46:37.590 --> 04:46:37.600 align:start position:0%
either Superior Court or um
 
04:46:39.910 --> 04:46:39.920 align:start position:0%
budsman that if there's an appeal that
 
04:46:42.590 --> 04:46:42.600 align:start position:0%
be rather than Superior Court be to the
 
04:46:42.600 --> 04:46:43.590 align:start position:0%
be rather than Superior Court be to the
Supreme

04:46:43.590 --> 04:46:43.600 align:start position:0%
Supreme
 
04:46:46.270 --> 04:46:46.280 align:start position:0%
Court um and that was my only point and
 
04:46:50.750 --> 04:46:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:55.430 --> 04:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
you yes representative walker uh so if
 
04:46:59.310 --> 04:46:59.320 align:start position:0%
if we chose to put the appeal directly
 
04:47:01.548 --> 04:47:01.558 align:start position:0%
to the Supreme Court we do that with no
 
04:47:06.548 --> 04:47:06.558 align:start position:0%
fing fees as we have with Superior
 
04:47:09.430 --> 04:47:09.440 align:start position:0%
Court obviously that's a a legislative
 
04:47:11.868 --> 04:47:11.878 align:start position:0%
uh right now there is a filing fee for
 
04:47:15.150 --> 04:47:15.160 align:start position:0%
appeal to Supreme Court
 
04:47:18.390 --> 04:47:18.400 align:start position:0%
um so that at least under current law
 
04:47:18.400 --> 04:47:24.510 align:start position:0%
um so that at least under current law
would

04:47:24.510 --> 04:47:24.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:30.750 --> 04:47:30.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:30.760 --> 04:47:32.390 align:start position:0%
 
no

04:47:32.390 --> 04:47:32.400 align:start position:0%
no
 
04:47:35.230 --> 04:47:35.240 align:start position:0%
I represent do you want to ask the
 
04:47:37.948 --> 04:47:37.958 align:start position:0%
question again I'm sorry
 
04:47:41.070 --> 04:47:41.080 align:start position:0%
Mr it sounds like no to
 
04:47:44.110 --> 04:47:44.120 align:start position:0%
Me Maybe I misunderstood at least right
 
04:47:46.788 --> 04:47:46.798 align:start position:0%
now the appeal would be to the spe Court
 
04:47:49.390 --> 04:47:49.400 align:start position:0%
which under the under the current law
 
04:47:53.190 --> 04:47:53.200 align:start position:0%
would be has would have no filing fee uh
 
04:47:54.590 --> 04:47:54.600 align:start position:0%
an appeal from the Superior Court to the
 
04:47:56.470 --> 04:47:56.480 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court would still have a filing
 
04:48:00.030 --> 04:48:00.040 align:start position:0%
fee under the current law um and I'm not
 
04:48:01.628 --> 04:48:01.638 align:start position:0%
I'm not making a recommendation one way
 
04:48:04.190 --> 04:48:04.200 align:start position:0%
or the other relative to the filing fee
 
04:48:10.708 --> 04:48:10.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:14.990 --> 04:48:15.000 align:start position:0%
legislation so uh if I can just
 
04:48:18.230 --> 04:48:18.240 align:start position:0%
ask if if in fact you did away with a
 
04:48:21.548 --> 04:48:21.558 align:start position:0%
denovo hearing in the Superior Court in
 
04:48:24.628 --> 04:48:24.638 align:start position:0%
effect the findings of the armsburg men
 
04:48:27.548 --> 04:48:27.558 align:start position:0%
would be final because the Supreme Court
 
04:48:30.030 --> 04:48:30.040 align:start position:0%
could only review it as a matter of law
 
04:48:32.590 --> 04:48:32.600 align:start position:0%
is that correct that's correct they
 
04:48:34.628 --> 04:48:34.638 align:start position:0%
wouldn't unless the unless there was no
 
04:48:37.510 --> 04:48:37.520 align:start position:0%
basis for a finding a fact the findings
 
04:48:41.270 --> 04:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
of fact would would presumably um the
 
04:48:43.910 --> 04:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
ombudsman's findings of fact would be
 
04:48:45.350 --> 04:48:45.360 align:start position:0%
would be in place and it would be
 
04:48:47.628 --> 04:48:47.638 align:start position:0%
appealed on rulings of law unless there
 
04:48:49.948 --> 04:48:49.958 align:start position:0%
was just no factual basis in the record
 
04:48:52.310 --> 04:48:52.320 align:start position:0%
for the EMB budsman factual
 
04:48:55.350 --> 04:48:55.360 align:start position:0%
findings so so if I could just follow up
 
04:48:58.190 --> 04:48:58.200 align:start position:0%
that would seem that that would make the
 
04:48:59.990 --> 04:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
AMS budman's
 
04:49:05.350 --> 04:49:05.360 align:start position:0%
rulings more effective in terms of of uh
 
04:49:08.670 --> 04:49:08.680 align:start position:0%
having an impact on the parties
 
04:49:10.990 --> 04:49:11.000 align:start position:0%
involved yeah I don't think I I I'm not
 
04:49:12.390 --> 04:49:12.400 align:start position:0%
going to express I don't have an opinion
 
04:49:15.510 --> 04:49:15.520 align:start position:0%
on that per se um as it as under the
 
04:49:17.948 --> 04:49:17.958 align:start position:0%
current language of the bill if it's not
 
04:49:21.030 --> 04:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
appealed the UDS men's decision is is
 
04:49:22.868 --> 04:49:22.878 align:start position:0%
filed in the superior court and can be
 
04:49:26.708 --> 04:49:26.718 align:start position:0%
enforced fully um if it was a direct
 
04:49:29.470 --> 04:49:29.480 align:start position:0%
appeal to the Supreme Court it it would
 
04:49:32.270 --> 04:49:32.280 align:start position:0%
essentially follow the rules of of any
 
04:49:35.110 --> 04:49:35.120 align:start position:0%
sort of normal agency appeal
 
04:49:38.750 --> 04:49:38.760 align:start position:0%
um where the the findings in of the
 
04:49:42.030 --> 04:49:42.040 align:start position:0%
administrative body um remain in place
 
04:49:45.830 --> 04:49:45.840 align:start position:0%
and thus there's no uh factual basis
 
04:49:47.270 --> 04:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
there's nothing to support it on the
 
04:49:50.270 --> 04:49:50.280 align:start position:0%
record um so then it would be a legal
 
04:49:56.868 --> 04:49:56.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:59.548 --> 04:49:59.558 align:start position:0%
correct okay are there other questions
 
04:50:00.788 --> 04:50:00.798 align:start position:0%
for Mr
 
04:50:02.830 --> 04:50:02.840 align:start position:0%
head representative
 
04:50:02.840 --> 04:50:04.470 align:start position:0%
head representative
Bur

04:50:04.470 --> 04:50:04.480 align:start position:0%
Bur
 
04:50:06.590 --> 04:50:06.600 align:start position:0%
yes my question was basically the same
 
04:50:11.510 --> 04:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
as representative Gordon's if I is it my
 
04:50:15.510 --> 04:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
understanding uh Mr head that uh uh a
 
04:50:20.708 --> 04:50:20.718 align:start position:0%
procedure at the uh uh ombudsman's level
 
04:50:24.590 --> 04:50:24.600 align:start position:0%
with no rules of evidence no rules of
 
04:50:28.310 --> 04:50:28.320 align:start position:0%
procedure um an uncertain question about
 
04:50:31.788 --> 04:50:31.798 align:start position:0%
compelling testimony and people that
 
04:50:36.270 --> 04:50:36.280 align:start position:0%
that would lock in the uh the factual
 
04:50:41.230 --> 04:50:41.240 align:start position:0%
portion of the uh proceeding and uh both
 
04:50:44.830 --> 04:50:44.840 align:start position:0%
sides would be so to speak stuck with it
 
04:50:47.350 --> 04:50:47.360 align:start position:0%
again I would just caveat as you know
 
04:50:50.350 --> 04:50:50.360 align:start position:0%
with any most administrative agencies do
 
04:50:54.230 --> 04:50:54.240 align:start position:0%
not follow the the uh rules the The
 
04:50:56.430 --> 04:50:56.440 align:start position:0%
Rules of Evidence or procedure of
 
04:50:58.670 --> 04:50:58.680 align:start position:0%
superior court so it' be a similar
 
04:51:00.670 --> 04:51:00.680 align:start position:0%
appeal to as to any administrative
 
04:51:03.948 --> 04:51:03.958 align:start position:0%
agency uh be based on the record below
 
04:51:06.430 --> 04:51:06.440 align:start position:0%
there is a limited ability to review the
 
04:51:09.788 --> 04:51:09.798 align:start position:0%
factual record as I said before um to
 
04:51:12.230 --> 04:51:12.240 align:start position:0%
make sure it was supported by the record
 
04:51:14.910 --> 04:51:14.920 align:start position:0%
but if supported by the record then it's
 
04:51:18.590 --> 04:51:18.600 align:start position:0%
largely a an appeal of the legal
 
04:51:20.868 --> 04:51:20.878 align:start position:0%
issues thank
 
04:51:28.788 --> 04:51:28.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:32.150 --> 04:51:32.160 align:start position:0%
head well we're not going to let her ask
 
04:51:34.948 --> 04:51:34.958 align:start position:0%
a question but we call up on her again

needed okay and since then each year she
 
04:52:47.310 --> 04:52:47.320 align:start position:0%

the summer campaigning in my town or

city of
 
04:55:41.670 --> 04:55:41.680 align:start position:0%
lonia what happened
 
04:55:46.750 --> 04:55:46.760 align:start position:0%
was uh our city council moved to uh
 
04:55:49.430 --> 04:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
purchase a property it was
 
04:55:53.430 --> 04:55:53.440 align:start position:0%
a uh Church property um in near the
 
04:55:57.070 --> 04:55:57.080 align:start position:0%
center of town and uh they paid I want
 
04:55:59.190 --> 04:55:59.200 align:start position:0%
to say about
 
04:56:03.830 --> 04:56:03.840 align:start position:0%
1.25 million for it uh with zero public
 
04:56:07.510 --> 04:56:07.520 align:start position:0%
zero public input nobody knew uh that it
 
04:56:09.390 --> 04:56:09.400 align:start position:0%
had happened
 
04:56:13.390 --> 04:56:13.400 align:start position:0%
until um somebody had noticed it at the
 
04:56:15.670 --> 04:56:15.680 align:start position:0%
registry of
 
04:56:19.350 --> 04:56:19.360 align:start position:0%
deeds uh when confronted about uh how
 
04:56:23.230 --> 04:56:23.240 align:start position:0%
this went down the city council
 
04:56:26.708 --> 04:56:26.718 align:start position:0%
um our city council uh every year or
 
04:56:29.070 --> 04:56:29.080 align:start position:0%
every couple years when they uh convene
 
04:56:30.708 --> 04:56:30.718 align:start position:0%
much like the House of Representatives
 
04:56:33.270 --> 04:56:33.280 align:start position:0%
down in conquered uh they adopt rules in
 
04:56:35.430 --> 04:56:35.440 align:start position:0%
among the rules uh one of them is for
 
04:56:37.510 --> 04:56:37.520 align:start position:0%
non-public session on under
 
04:56:42.670 --> 04:56:42.680 align:start position:0%
91a uh 91a they uh cited for the reason
 
04:56:45.270 --> 04:56:45.280 align:start position:0%
for them not needing to uh give any
 
04:56:47.510 --> 04:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
notice at all
 
04:56:50.590 --> 04:56:50.600 align:start position:0%
um the problem with
 
04:56:54.548 --> 04:56:54.558 align:start position:0%
this is that also in the budget and this
 
04:56:57.030 --> 04:56:57.040 align:start position:0%
is just a little side note in the budget
 
04:57:00.270 --> 04:57:00.280 align:start position:0%
that they had they uh created a thing
 
04:57:00.280 --> 04:57:01.470 align:start position:0%
that they had they uh created a thing
called

04:57:01.470 --> 04:57:01.480 align:start position:0%
called
 
04:57:04.990 --> 04:57:05.000 align:start position:0%
XYZ um it was
 
04:57:09.190 --> 04:57:09.200 align:start position:0%
to put in a bond of believe around s or
 
04:57:13.590 --> 04:57:13.600 align:start position:0%
$800,000 that Bond uh was not earmarked
 
04:57:14.990 --> 04:57:15.000 align:start position:0%
for any
 
04:57:17.270 --> 04:57:17.280 align:start position:0%
purpose we later found out what the
 
04:57:19.628 --> 04:57:19.638 align:start position:0%
purpose was it was to buy that property
 
04:57:22.110 --> 04:57:22.120 align:start position:0%
so they not only knew well in advance
 
04:57:23.390 --> 04:57:23.400 align:start position:0%
that they were going to purchase the
 
04:57:25.708 --> 04:57:25.718 align:start position:0%
property or at least make an offer on it
 
04:57:28.110 --> 04:57:28.120 align:start position:0%
they also kept that from the public to
 
04:57:29.990 --> 04:57:30.000 align:start position:0%
add insult to injury and this is all in
 
04:57:31.990 --> 04:57:32.000 align:start position:0%
the supporting documents that I I
 
04:57:33.750 --> 04:57:33.760 align:start position:0%
provided um
 
04:57:37.628 --> 04:57:37.638 align:start position:0%
they also uh the city manager had sent a
 
04:57:40.070 --> 04:57:40.080 align:start position:0%
memo to the city council including the
 
04:57:42.628 --> 04:57:42.638 align:start position:0%
mayor instructing them not to mention or
 
04:57:44.150 --> 04:57:44.160 align:start position:0%
speak of the
 
04:57:48.390 --> 04:57:48.400 align:start position:0%
XYZ uh at all to the public so you can
 
04:57:51.230 --> 04:57:51.240 align:start position:0%
imagine the backlash that the folks here
 
04:57:53.708 --> 04:57:53.718 align:start position:0%
in town uh had over that they were not
 
04:57:55.788 --> 04:57:55.798 align:start position:0%
uh very happy about
 
04:57:58.030 --> 04:57:58.040 align:start position:0%
it this is not the only time this has
 
04:58:00.510 --> 04:58:00.520 align:start position:0%
happened I also have one other Link in
 
04:58:03.868 --> 04:58:03.878 align:start position:0%
there um this uh sort of has also
 
04:58:06.030 --> 04:58:06.040 align:start position:0%
happened once before uh with another
 
04:58:08.708 --> 04:58:08.718 align:start position:0%
property in town to the tune of around
 
04:58:10.830 --> 04:58:10.840 align:start position:0%
$350,000 that's also in there for you
 
04:58:15.230 --> 04:58:15.240 align:start position:0%
folks to to check out um to get to the
 
04:58:17.868 --> 04:58:17.878 align:start position:0%
bill itself what I noticed when I read
 
04:58:19.510 --> 04:58:19.520 align:start position:0%
through it and the the section that they
 
04:58:21.390 --> 04:58:21.400 align:start position:0%
were talking about that they cited
 
04:58:24.350 --> 04:58:24.360 align:start position:0%
specifically for their ability to uh to
 
04:58:29.270 --> 04:58:29.280 align:start position:0%
do this is uh is uh what my bill
 
04:58:29.280 --> 04:58:30.628 align:start position:0%
do this is uh is uh what my bill
directly

04:58:30.628 --> 04:58:30.638 align:start position:0%
directly
 
04:58:34.150 --> 04:58:34.160 align:start position:0%
addresses a common phrase or word that's
 
04:58:37.750 --> 04:58:37.760 align:start position:0%
used throughout 91a is the word
 
04:58:40.310 --> 04:58:40.320 align:start position:0%
consideration uh if you'll notice
 
04:58:43.030 --> 04:58:43.040 align:start position:0%
throughout uh 91a it's used I want to
 
04:58:46.628 --> 04:58:46.638 align:start position:0%
say I believe nine times and in uh all
 
04:58:48.470 --> 04:58:48.480 align:start position:0%
the other instances it's the standard
 
04:58:52.350 --> 04:58:52.360 align:start position:0%
use of the word uh the word for you know
 
04:58:53.708 --> 04:58:53.718 align:start position:0%
considering to purchase something
 
04:58:56.788 --> 04:58:56.798 align:start position:0%
considering uh uh maybe uh to talk about
 
04:58:59.190 --> 04:58:59.200 align:start position:0%
something considering firing and hiring
 
04:59:01.708 --> 04:59:01.718 align:start position:0%
folks uh all of these things are kind of
 
04:59:04.430 --> 04:59:04.440 align:start position:0%
in there it occurred to me from my
 
04:59:06.910 --> 04:59:06.920 align:start position:0%
background as a real estate broker years
 
04:59:10.470 --> 04:59:10.480 align:start position:0%
ago that consideration means money it
 
04:59:13.948 --> 04:59:13.958 align:start position:0%
means uh the transfer of or promise of
 
04:59:16.270 --> 04:59:16.280 align:start position:0%
uh something of
 
04:59:19.868 --> 04:59:19.878 align:start position:0%
value so it doesn't mean in this
 
04:59:22.350 --> 04:59:22.360 align:start position:0%
particular instance that they can talk
 
04:59:24.788 --> 04:59:24.798 align:start position:0%
or discuss or decide what they're going
 
04:59:27.590 --> 04:59:27.600 align:start position:0%
to do it just gives them the shield to
 
04:59:30.310 --> 04:59:30.320 align:start position:0%
actually when they've already decided or
 
04:59:33.788 --> 04:59:33.798 align:start position:0%
discussed it um in public
 
04:59:36.270 --> 04:59:36.280 align:start position:0%
that they can then go behind closed
 
04:59:39.110 --> 04:59:39.120 align:start position:0%
doors in a in a p non-public session and
 
04:59:41.750 --> 04:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
decide what kind of offer uh what kind
 
04:59:44.070 --> 04:59:44.080 align:start position:0%
of uh uh money they may or may not want
 
04:59:47.510 --> 04:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
to to decide to use so that's the bill
 
04:59:51.270 --> 04:59:51.280 align:start position:0%
in a in a nutshell and um I'd be happy
 
04:59:52.868 --> 04:59:52.878 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions the committee
 
04:59:56.230 --> 04:59:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:01.948 --> 05:00:01.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:01.958 --> 05:00:12.708 align:start position:0%
 
representative

05:00:12.708 --> 05:00:12.718 align:start position:0%

05:00:38.390 --> 05:00:38.400 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for uh the opportunity to
 
05:00:40.430 --> 05:00:40.440 align:start position:0%
comment and voice my opposition to H
 
05:00:42.350 --> 05:00:42.360 align:start position:0%
Bill HB
 
05:00:45.350 --> 05:00:45.360 align:start position:0%
232 as the bill is currently written uh
 
05:00:47.430 --> 05:00:47.440 align:start position:0%
my name is Dave Karen I am the Town
 
05:00:49.628 --> 05:00:49.638 align:start position:0%
Administrator for the town of dairy and
 
05:00:51.390 --> 05:00:51.400 align:start position:0%
I've been serving uh local governments
 
05:00:54.868 --> 05:00:54.878 align:start position:0%
in the Hampshire for 40 years now you
 
05:00:56.070 --> 05:00:56.080 align:start position:0%
know there are currently few
 
05:00:57.830 --> 05:00:57.840 align:start position:0%
opportunities to empty non-public
 
05:01:00.150 --> 05:01:00.160 align:start position:0%
session pursuant to the right to no law
 
05:01:01.910 --> 05:01:01.920 align:start position:0%
which is good as both local and state
 
05:01:03.590 --> 05:01:03.600 align:start position:0%
governments in New Hampshire
 
05:01:05.990 --> 05:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
strive to maintain account accessibility
 
05:01:06.000 --> 05:01:07.110 align:start position:0%
strive to maintain account accessibility
and

05:01:07.110 --> 05:01:07.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:01:08.830 --> 05:01:08.840 align:start position:0%
transparency one of the current
 
05:01:10.510 --> 05:01:10.520 align:start position:0%
exemptions which is the ability to
 
05:01:12.910 --> 05:01:12.920 align:start position:0%
consider the acquisition sale or lease
 
05:01:15.708 --> 05:01:15.718 align:start position:0%
of real or personal property has served
 
05:01:17.990 --> 05:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
our citizens well and has allowed public
 
05:01:19.548 --> 05:01:19.558 align:start position:0%
bodies to conduct its business as
 
05:01:22.350 --> 05:01:22.360 align:start position:0%
directed by the legislative body in the
 
05:01:24.628 --> 05:01:24.638 align:start position:0%
most efficient and coste effective
 
05:01:27.430 --> 05:01:27.440 align:start position:0%
manner the proposed language in the bill
 
05:01:30.310 --> 05:01:30.320 align:start position:0%
is confusing to me and I suspect others
 
05:01:34.030 --> 05:01:34.040 align:start position:0%
and warrants clarification if the intent
 
05:01:35.590 --> 05:01:35.600 align:start position:0%
of the bill is to require that any
 
05:01:37.708 --> 05:01:37.718 align:start position:0%
binding offers or execution of a
 
05:01:40.390 --> 05:01:40.400 align:start position:0%
purchase and sales agreement be made by
 
05:01:42.868 --> 05:01:42.878 align:start position:0%
the governing body in Open Session then
 
05:01:45.750 --> 05:01:45.760 align:start position:0%
the intent should be made clear our
 
05:01:47.910 --> 05:01:47.920 align:start position:0%
understanding of the law is that this
 
05:01:50.548 --> 05:01:50.558 align:start position:0%
public process is currently required and
 
05:01:52.948 --> 05:01:52.958 align:start position:0%
one which we follow rewriting the
 
05:01:54.708 --> 05:01:54.718 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment to clearly State this
 
05:01:55.788 --> 05:01:55.798 align:start position:0%
intent would
 
05:01:59.190 --> 05:01:59.200 align:start position:0%
suffice my my concern with the current
 
05:02:01.310 --> 05:02:01.320 align:start position:0%
language is its
 
05:02:03.270 --> 05:02:03.280 align:start position:0%
interpretation the Lang language could
 
05:02:05.708 --> 05:02:05.718 align:start position:0%
be construed that a public body could
 
05:02:09.030 --> 05:02:09.040 align:start position:0%
only enter non-public session after it
 
05:02:11.628 --> 05:02:11.638 align:start position:0%
has had a public discussion on the
 
05:02:13.910 --> 05:02:13.920 align:start position:0%
desirability to acquire a specific
 
05:02:16.590 --> 05:02:16.600 align:start position:0%
property and has agreed to proceed with
 
05:02:18.788 --> 05:02:18.798 align:start position:0%
acquisition this interpretation is
 
05:02:21.470 --> 05:02:21.480 align:start position:0%
fraught with risk in our opinion first
 
05:02:23.868 --> 05:02:23.878 align:start position:0%
the M discussion along with the attended
 
05:02:27.190 --> 05:02:27.200 align:start position:0%
benefits of acquisition often results in
 
05:02:29.788 --> 05:02:29.798 align:start position:0%
a higher asking price which is contrary
 
05:02:33.110 --> 05:02:33.120 align:start position:0%
to the public good second during these
 
05:02:36.470 --> 05:02:36.480 align:start position:0%
public discussions a seller may B may
 
05:02:38.708 --> 05:02:38.718 align:start position:0%
better understand the motivations of the
 
05:02:41.030 --> 05:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
buyer which may have not been considered
 
05:02:43.150 --> 05:02:43.160 align:start position:0%
previously by the seller again
 
05:02:46.070 --> 05:02:46.080 align:start position:0%
potentially leading to higher costs due
 
05:02:48.750 --> 05:02:48.760 align:start position:0%
process in government takes time it has
 
05:02:50.110 --> 05:02:50.120 align:start position:0%
occurred in the Hampshire and
 
05:02:52.910 --> 05:02:52.920 align:start position:0%
experienced and witnessed by me that a
 
05:02:55.030 --> 05:02:55.040 align:start position:0%
third party has learned of a potential
 
05:02:57.230 --> 05:02:57.240 align:start position:0%
acquisition by a unit of government and
 
05:02:59.470 --> 05:02:59.480 align:start position:0%
has taken advantage of that due process
 
05:03:01.868 --> 05:03:01.878 align:start position:0%
period by purchasing the property by
 
05:03:04.350 --> 05:03:04.360 align:start position:0%
themselves and not making it available
 
05:03:07.510 --> 05:03:07.520 align:start position:0%
for uh the uh public body to further
 
05:03:10.910 --> 05:03:10.920 align:start position:0%
consider the purchase and lastly my main
 
05:03:13.788 --> 05:03:13.798 align:start position:0%
concern is to is the attempt to separate
 
05:03:15.990 --> 05:03:16.000 align:start position:0%
discussions regarding the advisability
 
05:03:17.990 --> 05:03:18.000 align:start position:0%
of acquisition versus
 
05:03:21.190 --> 05:03:21.200 align:start position:0%
negotiations these activities are
 
05:03:23.948 --> 05:03:23.958 align:start position:0%
inextricably linked as a public body
 
05:03:26.350 --> 05:03:26.360 align:start position:0%
considers price the discussion and
 
05:03:28.150 --> 05:03:28.160 align:start position:0%
variably winds back to the advantages of
 
05:03:30.430 --> 05:03:30.440 align:start position:0%
acquisition with additional discussions
 
05:03:33.948 --> 05:03:33.958 align:start position:0%
on cost and benefits we all if we as we
 
05:03:36.350 --> 05:03:36.360 align:start position:0%
have all learned in Our Lives plaintiffs
 
05:03:39.110 --> 05:03:39.120 align:start position:0%
who disagree with a lawful action resort
 
05:03:41.150 --> 05:03:41.160 align:start position:0%
to attack in the process and this
 
05:03:43.470 --> 05:03:43.480 align:start position:0%
language as currently proposed is right
 
05:03:45.868 --> 05:03:45.878 align:start position:0%
for conflict again thank you for the
 
05:03:49.948 --> 05:03:49.958 align:start position:0%
opportunity to offer comment on HB 232
 
05:03:51.310 --> 05:03:51.320 align:start position:0%
and I urge the committee to either
 
05:03:53.910 --> 05:03:53.920 align:start position:0%
clarify or reaffirm that a public vote
 
05:03:55.948 --> 05:03:55.958 align:start position:0%
is necessary to bind the unit of
 
05:03:58.150 --> 05:03:58.160 align:start position:0%
government when acquiring property or to
 
05:04:00.190 --> 05:04:00.200 align:start position:0%
alternately vote this bill as
 
05:04:02.150 --> 05:04:02.160 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate thank you for
 
05:04:06.110 --> 05:04:06.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:12.270 --> 05:04:12.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:15.270 --> 05:04:15.280 align:start position:0%
mren don't see any
 
05:04:19.670 --> 05:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:22.788 --> 05:04:22.798 align:start position:0%
testimony person who signed up to tesy
 
05:04:28.170 --> 05:04:28.180 align:start position:0%

05:04:33.270 --> 05:04:33.280 align:start position:0%
Johnson thank you uh thank you Mr
 
05:04:35.708 --> 05:04:35.718 align:start position:0%
chairman and committee members um again
 
05:04:37.590 --> 05:04:37.600 align:start position:0%
Cordell Johnston representing the New
 
05:04:39.110 --> 05:04:39.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Municipal
 
05:04:41.948 --> 05:04:41.958 align:start position:0%
Association I I think I may have signed
 
05:04:45.910 --> 05:04:45.920 align:start position:0%
up as neutral um but we are opposed to
 
05:04:49.990 --> 05:04:50.000 align:start position:0%
the bill as written and uh Miss Dave
 
05:04:52.910 --> 05:04:52.920 align:start position:0%
Karen who just spoke I think pretty much
 
05:04:57.230 --> 05:04:57.240 align:start position:0%
said what I would say um I think the
 
05:05:01.670 --> 05:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
bill goes too far uh I was not aware of
 
05:05:03.990 --> 05:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
the situation that the sponsor
 
05:05:08.948 --> 05:05:08.958 align:start position:0%
described um but if if the if if an
 
05:05:13.070 --> 05:05:13.080 align:start position:0%
entire discussion and transaction from
 
05:05:15.270 --> 05:05:15.280 align:start position:0%
beginning to end
 
05:05:17.510 --> 05:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
happens uh
 
05:05:20.350 --> 05:05:20.360 align:start position:0%
entirely outside of public session then
 
05:05:22.430 --> 05:05:22.440 align:start position:0%
I think there then I think there is a
 
05:05:22.440 --> 05:05:24.390 align:start position:0%
I think there then I think there is a
problem

05:05:24.390 --> 05:05:24.400 align:start position:0%
problem
 
05:05:26.788 --> 05:05:26.798 align:start position:0%
there I don't I don't want to comment on
 
05:05:28.708 --> 05:05:28.718 align:start position:0%
a on a situation where I'm not familiar
 
05:05:33.270 --> 05:05:33.280 align:start position:0%
with the facts but um but obviously
 
05:05:36.788 --> 05:05:36.798 align:start position:0%
certainly the final decision to to
 
05:05:39.948 --> 05:05:39.958 align:start position:0%
purchase uh property ought to be ought
 
05:05:43.910 --> 05:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
to be at least uh documented in public
 
05:05:46.788 --> 05:05:46.798 align:start position:0%
session not in not in non-public but I
 
05:05:48.868 --> 05:05:48.878 align:start position:0%
think the bill goes too far in saying
 
05:05:51.390 --> 05:05:51.400 align:start position:0%
that you can't have a
 
05:05:54.708 --> 05:05:54.718 align:start position:0%
discussion uh as to whether to proceed
 
05:05:57.670 --> 05:05:57.680 align:start position:0%
with an acquisition sale or lease of
 
05:06:00.628 --> 05:06:00.638 align:start position:0%
personal property in nonpublic session
 
05:06:03.270 --> 05:06:03.280 align:start position:0%
there are situations that again I think
 
05:06:07.510 --> 05:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
as Mr Karen described where um just
 
05:06:11.070 --> 05:06:11.080 align:start position:0%
discussing the need for for buying a
 
05:06:13.868 --> 05:06:13.878 align:start position:0%
particular piece of property if you dis
 
05:06:16.190 --> 05:06:16.200 align:start position:0%
if you discuss that in public
 
05:06:20.270 --> 05:06:20.280 align:start position:0%
session um that could indicate to the
 
05:06:21.590 --> 05:06:21.600 align:start position:0%
owner of the
 
05:06:25.070 --> 05:06:25.080 align:start position:0%
property that uh this is a that this is
 
05:06:26.948 --> 05:06:26.958 align:start position:0%
considered a highly valuable piece of
 
05:06:30.830 --> 05:06:30.840 align:start position:0%
property and give them a um an incentive
 
05:06:35.708 --> 05:06:35.718 align:start position:0%
to take a very strong position uh in any
 
05:06:39.670 --> 05:06:39.680 align:start position:0%
negotiations so I think I think the
 
05:06:43.270 --> 05:06:43.280 align:start position:0%
statues statute as it currently reads uh
 
05:06:44.430 --> 05:06:44.440 align:start position:0%
if it is
 
05:06:47.390 --> 05:06:47.400 align:start position:0%
followed uh scrupulously covers the
 
05:06:50.350 --> 05:06:50.360 align:start position:0%
problem it allows non-public discussion
 
05:06:54.150 --> 05:06:54.160 align:start position:0%
only if uh the discussion would likely
 
05:06:56.670 --> 05:06:56.680 align:start position:0%
benefit a party or parties whose
 
05:06:58.470 --> 05:06:58.480 align:start position:0%
interests are adverse to those of the
 
05:06:58.480 --> 05:06:59.430 align:start position:0%
interests are adverse to those of the
general

05:06:59.430 --> 05:06:59.440 align:start position:0%
general
 
05:07:03.470 --> 05:07:03.480 align:start position:0%
Community I I think that is adequate to
 
05:07:07.030 --> 05:07:07.040 align:start position:0%
uh protect uh the public interest and at
 
05:07:11.430 --> 05:07:11.440 align:start position:0%
the same time uh protect the uh the
 
05:07:15.190 --> 05:07:15.200 align:start position:0%
public body's ability to negotiate from
 
05:07:19.190 --> 05:07:19.200 align:start position:0%
a position of strength so I think
 
05:07:22.230 --> 05:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
um we would suggest that the language of
 
05:07:24.230 --> 05:07:24.240 align:start position:0%
the statute be left as it is because I
 
05:07:26.590 --> 05:07:26.600 align:start position:0%
think it I think it addresses the
 
05:07:29.270 --> 05:07:29.280 align:start position:0%
situation pretty
 
05:07:33.628 --> 05:07:33.638 align:start position:0%
well got questions for Mr Johnson
 
05:07:36.548 --> 05:07:36.558 align:start position:0%
Yes W thank you Mr
 
05:07:48.190 --> 05:07:48.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:51.390 --> 05:07:51.400 align:start position:0%
Johnson said raise the price of the
 
05:07:53.910 --> 05:07:53.920 align:start position:0%
property isn't that in opposition to the
 
05:07:56.590 --> 05:07:56.600 align:start position:0%
interest of the public and so isn't that
 
05:07:59.150 --> 05:07:59.160 align:start position:0%
always the
 
05:08:01.708 --> 05:08:01.718 align:start position:0%
case I'm sorry I could only hear a
 
05:08:03.470 --> 05:08:03.480 align:start position:0%
little bit uh I don't know whether it's
 
05:08:06.868 --> 05:08:06.878 align:start position:0%
possible to move the microphone closer
 
05:08:06.878 --> 05:08:08.590 align:start position:0%
possible to move the microphone closer
to

05:08:08.590 --> 05:08:08.600 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:08:12.310 --> 05:08:12.320 align:start position:0%
you it seems to me that if the public
 
05:08:15.430 --> 05:08:15.440 align:start position:0%
part is considering buying
 
05:08:20.350 --> 05:08:20.360 align:start position:0%
property and discussion in the in Open
 
05:08:23.350 --> 05:08:23.360 align:start position:0%
Session will drive up the price of that
 
05:08:26.548 --> 05:08:26.558 align:start position:0%
property for Harden the negotiating
 
05:08:28.750 --> 05:08:28.760 align:start position:0%
position of the potential
 
05:08:32.910 --> 05:08:32.920 align:start position:0%
sell then in every transaction
 
05:08:35.750 --> 05:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
would create the situation that
 
05:08:39.150 --> 05:08:39.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:42.830 --> 05:08:42.840 align:start position:0%
not I think I think at some point every
 
05:08:46.150 --> 05:08:46.160 align:start position:0%
situation would would lead to would
 
05:08:48.788 --> 05:08:48.798 align:start position:0%
would lead to a need to to go into
 
05:08:52.750 --> 05:08:52.760 align:start position:0%
non-public session I I don't think every
 
05:08:57.270 --> 05:08:57.280 align:start position:0%
situation would start that way um if
 
05:09:01.030 --> 05:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
it's the if it's simply a discussion
 
05:09:03.030 --> 05:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
that the town
 
05:09:06.110 --> 05:09:06.120 align:start position:0%
uh needs to uh
 
05:09:09.590 --> 05:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
is uh looking for property for a new
 
05:09:09.600 --> 05:09:10.830 align:start position:0%
is uh looking for property for a new
police

05:09:10.830 --> 05:09:10.840 align:start position:0%
police
 
05:09:14.350 --> 05:09:14.360 align:start position:0%
station um I don't think that by itself
 
05:09:16.830 --> 05:09:16.840 align:start position:0%
comes within the current exemption for
 
05:09:16.840 --> 05:09:18.150 align:start position:0%
comes within the current exemption for
non-public

05:09:18.150 --> 05:09:18.160 align:start position:0%
non-public
 
05:09:20.868 --> 05:09:20.878 align:start position:0%
session uh there but there does come a
 
05:09:24.190 --> 05:09:24.200 align:start position:0%
point and you know it's it's not a hard
 
05:09:26.310 --> 05:09:26.320 align:start position:0%
and fast line but there does come a
 
05:09:29.350 --> 05:09:29.360 align:start position:0%
point where uh where the
 
05:09:31.750 --> 05:09:31.760 align:start position:0%
discussions where the discussions need
 
05:09:37.310 --> 05:09:37.320 align:start position:0%
to be in nonpublic to uh to not give the
 
05:09:40.270 --> 05:09:40.280 align:start position:0%
party on the other side um an unfair an
 
05:09:43.590 --> 05:09:43.600 align:start position:0%
unfair advantage and and I I I I can't
 
05:09:46.430 --> 05:09:46.440 align:start position:0%
tell you exactly where that is it's a
 
05:09:51.910 --> 05:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:58.310 --> 05:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:01.230 --> 05:10:01.240 align:start position:0%
Johnston thank you for your testimony
 
05:10:03.948 --> 05:10:03.958 align:start position:0%

representative Huff I had my hand up but

sorry about that I apologize thank you
 
05:10:20.470 --> 05:10:20.480 align:start position:0%
representative H would you like to would
 
05:10:23.270 --> 05:10:23.280 align:start position:0%
you be willing to take a question
 
05:10:25.670 --> 05:10:25.680 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead
 
05:10:27.868 --> 05:10:27.878 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chair and
 
05:10:29.868 --> 05:10:29.878 align:start position:0%
thank you um representative Huff for
 
05:10:32.350 --> 05:10:32.360 align:start position:0%
taking my question you know in your
 
05:10:35.948 --> 05:10:35.958 align:start position:0%
testimony you mentioned um at least two
 
05:10:38.310 --> 05:10:38.320 align:start position:0%
instances in which
 
05:10:41.030 --> 05:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
um there was a
 
05:10:45.788 --> 05:10:45.798 align:start position:0%
cloud over the sale and acquisition of a
 
05:10:48.470 --> 05:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
property and you said that you thought
 
05:10:52.110 --> 05:10:52.120 align:start position:0%
that the RSA 91a uh was
 
05:10:52.120 --> 05:10:54.230 align:start position:0%
that the RSA 91a uh was
violated

05:10:54.230 --> 05:10:54.240 align:start position:0%
violated
 
05:10:56.350 --> 05:10:56.360 align:start position:0%
um is this
 
05:11:00.948 --> 05:11:00.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:05.430 --> 05:11:05.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I have come across um
 
05:11:09.030 --> 05:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
anecdotal evidence um I've I've talked
 
05:11:10.150 --> 05:11:10.160 align:start position:0%
to other
 
05:11:13.830 --> 05:11:13.840 align:start position:0%
Representatives that uh say that it
 
05:11:15.590 --> 05:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
similar circumstances have happened in
 
05:11:18.270 --> 05:11:18.280 align:start position:0%
their town for example one in um
 
05:11:21.030 --> 05:11:21.040 align:start position:0%
sington um the difference was is that
 
05:11:23.670 --> 05:11:23.680 align:start position:0%
the consideration was actually an
 
05:11:26.788 --> 05:11:26.798 align:start position:0%
exchange of property um again this is
 
05:11:29.310 --> 05:11:29.320 align:start position:0%
anecdotal and I don't have any any
 
05:11:32.470 --> 05:11:32.480 align:start position:0%
backup for that um apparently the story
 
05:11:36.750 --> 05:11:36.760 align:start position:0%
was um they wanted oddly enough a police
 
05:11:39.910 --> 05:11:39.920 align:start position:0%
station and they traded that property
 
05:11:41.230 --> 05:11:41.240 align:start position:0%
for a different property for a new
 
05:11:43.670 --> 05:11:43.680 align:start position:0%
police station um I also heard of
 
05:11:45.548 --> 05:11:45.558 align:start position:0%
something uh down in Nashville but I was
 
05:11:48.310 --> 05:11:48.320 align:start position:0%
not able to actually run that one
 
05:11:52.350 --> 05:11:52.360 align:start position:0%
down thank you Mr chairman follow
 
05:11:54.750 --> 05:11:54.760 align:start position:0%
up okay so
 
05:11:58.830 --> 05:11:58.840 align:start position:0%
um and secondly I'm wondering if there
 
05:12:02.430 --> 05:12:02.440 align:start position:0%
is enough if you have any documented
 
05:12:06.150 --> 05:12:06.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:09.948 --> 05:12:09.958 align:start position:0%
issue so that it's large enough to
 
05:12:12.788 --> 05:12:12.798 align:start position:0%
become a new
 
05:12:15.190 --> 05:12:15.200 align:start position:0%
statute um that's a great question and
 
05:12:19.868 --> 05:12:19.878 align:start position:0%
thank you uh I think a million two to
 
05:12:22.708 --> 05:12:22.718 align:start position:0%
the people of lonia is enough and as
 
05:12:25.070 --> 05:12:25.080 align:start position:0%
somebody pointed out in their testimony
 
05:12:28.948 --> 05:12:28.958 align:start position:0%
uh preceding the question um he used the
 
05:12:32.350 --> 05:12:32.360 align:start position:0%
term if if it is followed uh
 
05:12:35.190 --> 05:12:35.200 align:start position:0%
well it hasn't been and when one person
 
05:12:36.910 --> 05:12:36.920 align:start position:0%
or group can figure out that they can
 
05:12:41.470 --> 05:12:41.480 align:start position:0%
circumvent it then others will follow um
 
05:12:44.788 --> 05:12:44.798 align:start position:0%
the purpose and uh Mr chairman if I may
 
05:12:48.110 --> 05:12:48.120 align:start position:0%
expound on this a little bit go ahead
 
05:12:49.910 --> 05:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:12:52.868 --> 05:12:52.878 align:start position:0%
um the the um
 
05:12:52.878 --> 05:12:54.948 align:start position:0%
um the the um
characterization

05:12:54.948 --> 05:12:54.958 align:start position:0%
characterization
 
05:13:00.750 --> 05:13:00.760 align:start position:0%
of the two pre uhe uh previous uh uh
 
05:13:00.760 --> 05:13:02.350 align:start position:0%
of the two pre uhe uh previous uh uh
speakers

05:13:02.350 --> 05:13:02.360 align:start position:0%
speakers
 
05:13:05.270 --> 05:13:05.280 align:start position:0%
isn't quite exactly right um if if you
 
05:13:08.030 --> 05:13:08.040 align:start position:0%
actually read it it's the bill um that
 
05:13:09.910 --> 05:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
I'm proposing says this sub paragraph
 
05:13:12.030 --> 05:13:12.040 align:start position:0%
shall not apply to General discussion or
 
05:13:14.510 --> 05:13:14.520 align:start position:0%
deliberation whether to proceed with an
 
05:13:17.830 --> 05:13:17.840 align:start position:0%
acquisition um they certainly absolutely
 
05:13:20.030 --> 05:13:20.040 align:start position:0%
can get behind closed doors to discuss
 
05:13:24.788 --> 05:13:24.798 align:start position:0%
the finances um and also the idea of it
 
05:13:24.798 --> 05:13:26.430 align:start position:0%
the finances um and also the idea of it
tainting

05:13:26.430 --> 05:13:26.440 align:start position:0%
tainting
 
05:13:29.470 --> 05:13:29.480 align:start position:0%
uh one way or another or influencing one
 
05:13:32.150 --> 05:13:32.160 align:start position:0%
way or another the reality is in real
 
05:13:34.788 --> 05:13:34.798 align:start position:0%
estate it's a an agreement between two
 
05:13:39.350 --> 05:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
people if a seller puts out a a property
 
05:13:42.990 --> 05:13:43.000 align:start position:0%
or it says it's uh available a buyer can
 
05:13:45.868 --> 05:13:45.878 align:start position:0%
can offer the seller can always say uh
 
05:13:48.590 --> 05:13:48.600 align:start position:0%
well I want more or the buyer can say
 
05:13:51.070 --> 05:13:51.080 align:start position:0%
okay or I'm not going to pay it it's a
 
05:13:53.910 --> 05:13:53.920 align:start position:0%
mutual thing it's it's free market and I
 
05:13:56.830 --> 05:13:56.840 align:start position:0%
would just like to end uh my statement
 
05:14:00.670 --> 05:14:00.680 align:start position:0%
real quick here um with the preamble to
 
05:14:00.680 --> 05:14:02.430 align:start position:0%
real quick here um with the preamble to
91a

05:14:02.430 --> 05:14:02.440 align:start position:0%
91a
 
05:14:03.948 --> 05:14:03.958 align:start position:0%
because I think this really hits to to
 
05:14:06.270 --> 05:14:06.280 align:start position:0%
the point of this whole thing openness
 
05:14:08.470 --> 05:14:08.480 align:start position:0%
in the conduct of public business is
 
05:14:12.470 --> 05:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
essential to a uh Democratic Society the
 
05:14:15.070 --> 05:14:15.080 align:start position:0%
purpose of this chapter is to ensure
 
05:14:18.910 --> 05:14:18.920 align:start position:0%
both the greatest possible public access
 
05:14:22.590 --> 05:14:22.600 align:start position:0%
to the actions discussions and records
 
05:14:24.830 --> 05:14:24.840 align:start position:0%
of all public bodies and their
 
05:14:27.948 --> 05:14:27.958 align:start position:0%
accountability to the people and and
 
05:14:31.270 --> 05:14:31.280 align:start position:0%
with that that's that's all I have folks
 
05:14:32.310 --> 05:14:32.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:14:34.470 --> 05:14:34.480 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for the
 
05:14:34.480 --> 05:14:43.830 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for the
question

05:14:43.830 --> 05:14:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:43.840 --> 05:14:47.310 align:start position:0%
 
representative

05:14:47.310 --> 05:14:47.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:49.990 --> 05:14:50.000 align:start position:0%
here there this would be better yes I
 
05:14:51.590 --> 05:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
got a two-part question my first one I
 
05:14:53.830 --> 05:14:53.840 align:start position:0%
guess is direct
 
05:14:56.270 --> 05:14:56.280 align:start position:0%
specific at represent Huff the other is
 
05:14:58.390 --> 05:14:58.400 align:start position:0%
more might be for the chair it's about
 
05:15:01.390 --> 05:15:01.400 align:start position:0%
uh just the documentation that sent to
 
05:15:04.350 --> 05:15:04.360 align:start position:0%
us but the uh so you're talking about
 
05:15:07.548 --> 05:15:07.558 align:start position:0%
the city council and versus the people
 
05:15:10.310 --> 05:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
but and certainly City council's not
 
05:15:11.830 --> 05:15:11.840 align:start position:0%
everybody supports everything the city
 
05:15:13.910 --> 05:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
council does but isn't the city council
 
05:15:16.470 --> 05:15:16.480 align:start position:0%
actually acting on behalf of the people
 
05:15:19.310 --> 05:15:19.320 align:start position:0%
of lonia who elected them or do you see
 
05:15:22.628 --> 05:15:22.638 align:start position:0%
them as uh entire apart from the people
 
05:15:26.230 --> 05:15:26.240 align:start position:0%
so I'm just not sure uh I clarify what
 
05:15:28.310 --> 05:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
you meant by that I mean certainly um I
 
05:15:29.590 --> 05:15:29.600 align:start position:0%
don't know anything think I have no
 
05:15:31.070 --> 05:15:31.080 align:start position:0%
opinion whether this real estate deal is
 
05:15:32.548 --> 05:15:32.558 align:start position:0%
a good good good idea or not but you
 
05:15:34.910 --> 05:15:34.920 align:start position:0%
know City councils and town councils you
 
05:15:36.548 --> 05:15:36.558 align:start position:0%
have to buy property all the time from
 
05:15:39.030 --> 05:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
private sector so you're what sort of
 
05:15:40.350 --> 05:15:40.360 align:start position:0%
Distinction were you making though
 
05:15:43.510 --> 05:15:43.520 align:start position:0%
between the people and the city council
 
05:15:46.470 --> 05:15:46.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:49.708 --> 05:15:49.718 align:start position:0%
but thank you fa thank you
 
05:15:52.708 --> 05:15:52.718 align:start position:0%
representative um I understand your
 
05:15:56.470 --> 05:15:56.480 align:start position:0%
question um it's not a it's not a a US
 
05:16:00.470 --> 05:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
versus them uh scenario the reality is
 
05:16:02.150 --> 05:16:02.160 align:start position:0%
uh once they're elected they are
 
05:16:05.670 --> 05:16:05.680 align:start position:0%
entrusted to uh to carry out the the
 
05:16:09.230 --> 05:16:09.240 align:start position:0%
business uh at hand and as such this
 
05:16:12.708 --> 05:16:12.718 align:start position:0%
will not hamper that literally uh
 
05:16:16.110 --> 05:16:16.120 align:start position:0%
whether the people whether the folks who
 
05:16:18.990 --> 05:16:19.000 align:start position:0%
are afforded something a deal or against
 
05:16:22.430 --> 05:16:22.440 align:start position:0%
it the city council or whatever uh body
 
05:16:24.750 --> 05:16:24.760 align:start position:0%
that's elected to to handle the business
 
05:16:26.548 --> 05:16:26.558 align:start position:0%
is going to choose to do what it is that
 
05:16:28.190 --> 05:16:28.200 align:start position:0%
they're going to do at the end of the
 
05:16:32.270 --> 05:16:32.280 align:start position:0%
day all this does is is allow the folk
 
05:16:34.910 --> 05:16:34.920 align:start position:0%
what it is that's going on before it's
 
05:16:37.990 --> 05:16:38.000 align:start position:0%
already done and that isn't that the
 
05:16:39.990 --> 05:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
entire heart of
 
05:16:40.000 --> 05:16:44.788 align:start position:0%
entire heart of
uh

05:16:44.788 --> 05:16:44.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:48.510 --> 05:16:48.520 align:start position:0%
91a I suppose I suppose to Mr chairman
 
05:16:51.230 --> 05:16:51.240 align:start position:0%
my second question um so representative
 
05:16:53.788 --> 05:16:53.798 align:start position:0%
Huff sent a sent us a uh letter which
 
05:16:55.708 --> 05:16:55.718 align:start position:0%
presumably want to be in the permanent
 
05:16:58.390 --> 05:16:58.400 align:start position:0%
record and guess in the past it's been
 
05:16:59.750 --> 05:16:59.760 align:start position:0%
kind of hard to find these permanent
 
05:17:02.868 --> 05:17:02.878 align:start position:0%
records but thanks to circumstan we uh
 
05:17:06.628 --> 05:17:06.638 align:start position:0%
you Mak some changes how we handle it so
 
05:17:10.990 --> 05:17:11.000 align:start position:0%
should represent Huff or somebody um
 
05:17:14.990 --> 05:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
obtain actual copies of the links to
 
05:17:16.910 --> 05:17:16.920 align:start position:0%
three news articles and a letter to the
 
05:17:18.868 --> 05:17:18.878 align:start position:0%
editor from The lonia Daily Sun which
 
05:17:22.230 --> 05:17:22.240 align:start position:0%
right now is not behind a pay wall um
 
05:17:23.868 --> 05:17:23.878 align:start position:0%
all these articles are still available
 
05:17:26.110 --> 05:17:26.120 align:start position:0%
but would it would it be some value in
 
05:17:29.510 --> 05:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
having res Huffer somebody submit actual
 
05:17:31.548 --> 05:17:31.558 align:start position:0%
like copies of the Articles like show
 
05:17:34.788 --> 05:17:34.798 align:start position:0%
what the link led to at the time of of
 
05:17:38.230 --> 05:17:38.240 align:start position:0%
this hearing um because in the past the
 
05:17:39.470 --> 05:17:39.480 align:start position:0%
past we would have expected him bring in
 
05:17:42.030 --> 05:17:42.040 align:start position:0%
a print out of the articles but that's
 
05:17:45.150 --> 05:17:45.160 align:start position:0%
uh you know that's not practical because
 
05:17:47.708 --> 05:17:47.718 align:start position:0%
he's uh remotely and actually the same
 
05:17:50.670 --> 05:17:50.680 align:start position:0%
issue could apply to the supposedly the
 
05:17:52.590 --> 05:17:52.600 align:start position:0%
document the registry of deeds but that
 
05:17:54.470 --> 05:17:54.480 align:start position:0%
those are expensive and difficult to
 
05:17:57.750 --> 05:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
obtain so I wouldn't fault anyone for
 
05:18:00.750 --> 05:18:00.760 align:start position:0%
just I not just you know taking it
 
05:18:02.310 --> 05:18:02.320 align:start position:0%
Taking the word of the person can count
 
05:18:04.750 --> 05:18:04.760 align:start position:0%
the register Deeds I'm not necessarily
 
05:18:06.190 --> 05:18:06.200 align:start position:0%
the committee needs to see the register
 
05:18:07.670 --> 05:18:07.680 align:start position:0%
Deeds documents but it would be simple
 
05:18:10.110 --> 05:18:10.120 align:start position:0%
at this time to preserve these articles
 
05:18:12.350 --> 05:18:12.360 align:start position:0%
as they are now because they might not
 
05:18:14.150 --> 05:18:14.160 align:start position:0%
be that way you know the next time we
 
05:18:16.270 --> 05:18:16.280 align:start position:0%
have a related Bill and probably in the
 
05:18:17.990 --> 05:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
future it's going to be easier to get
 
05:18:19.390 --> 05:18:19.400 align:start position:0%
hold of these Bill files they're not
 
05:18:21.670 --> 05:18:21.680 align:start position:0%
going to be just hidden either on the
 
05:18:23.350 --> 05:18:23.360 align:start position:0%
second or the fourth floor depending on
 
05:18:25.750 --> 05:18:25.760 align:start position:0%
how long it's been since the hearing and
 
05:18:27.830 --> 05:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
really GNA be easier to find in the
 
05:18:28.990 --> 05:18:29.000 align:start position:0%
future and people are probably going to
 
05:18:32.270 --> 05:18:32.280 align:start position:0%
rely on them more so representative hu
 
05:18:34.708 --> 05:18:34.718 align:start position:0%
is able to send that to the committee as
 
05:18:38.430 --> 05:18:38.440 align:start position:0%
a whole he wishes to do so be
 
05:18:42.670 --> 05:18:42.680 align:start position:0%
happy and if he's unable to do that and
 
05:18:44.390 --> 05:18:44.400 align:start position:0%
he wants to send it to me then I can
 
05:18:46.868 --> 05:18:46.878 align:start position:0%
forward it
 
05:18:49.750 --> 05:18:49.760 align:start position:0%
on sounds thanks sounds yeah sounds good
 
05:18:52.190 --> 05:18:52.200 align:start position:0%
to me thanks Mr chair I know I'm making
 
05:18:53.868 --> 05:18:53.878 align:start position:0%
more work for our we're making more work
 
05:18:55.510 --> 05:18:55.520 align:start position:0%
for ourselves and we're overwhelmed as
 
05:18:57.150 --> 05:18:57.160 align:start position:0%
it is but yeah that that sounds like a
 
05:19:02.708 --> 05:19:02.718 align:start position:0%
good idea thank you I agree yes Mr chair
 
05:19:07.030 --> 05:19:07.040 align:start position:0%
yes I I I can um I can download and get
 
05:19:09.470 --> 05:19:09.480 align:start position:0%
copies of those um if you would like and
 
05:19:11.990 --> 05:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
I can either mail them in or or um drop
 
05:19:14.350 --> 05:19:14.360 align:start position:0%
them off when I come in for my committee
 
05:19:17.750 --> 05:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
uh later in the week think that if you
 
05:19:19.788 --> 05:19:19.798 align:start position:0%
look at the link where you signed up to
 
05:19:22.830 --> 05:19:22.840 align:start position:0%
testify it will have a means of forward
 
05:19:24.830 --> 05:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
testimony as well and that might be your
 
05:19:28.708 --> 05:19:28.718 align:start position:0%
most convenient way without
 
05:19:28.718 --> 05:19:30.230 align:start position:0%
most convenient way without
cop

05:19:30.230 --> 05:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
cop
 
05:19:30.240 --> 05:19:33.590 align:start position:0%
cop
okay

05:19:33.590 --> 05:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:39.868 --> 05:19:39.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:59.948 --> 05:19:59.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:03.390 --> 05:20:03.400 align:start position:0%
breath hi sorry this stupid unmute comes
 
05:20:03.400 --> 05:20:04.270 align:start position:0%
breath hi sorry this stupid unmute comes
up

05:20:04.270 --> 05:20:04.280 align:start position:0%
up
 
05:20:08.270 --> 05:20:08.280 align:start position:0%
after uh the the difference between
 
05:20:10.868 --> 05:20:10.878 align:start position:0%
towns and cities buying L land in
 
05:20:13.868 --> 05:20:13.878 align:start position:0%
comparison to the state is having worked
 
05:20:16.830 --> 05:20:16.840 align:start position:0%
as an appraiser fori way we appraised
 
05:20:19.510 --> 05:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
the land then make an offer that we want
 
05:20:23.510 --> 05:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
to buy it versus a town or city they
 
05:20:26.230 --> 05:20:26.240 align:start position:0%
hide it behind
 
05:20:29.470 --> 05:20:29.480 align:start position:0%
doors and in the long run if they really
 
05:20:31.750 --> 05:20:31.760 align:start position:0%
want only a certain piece
 
05:20:34.190 --> 05:20:34.200 align:start position:0%
they have the right of eminent domain
 
05:20:37.350 --> 05:20:37.360 align:start position:0%
and so in my opinion there should be no
 
05:20:40.628 --> 05:20:40.638 align:start position:0%
exemption for the buying and
 
05:20:45.510 --> 05:20:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:49.510 --> 05:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
you there were other people who did
 
05:20:52.030 --> 05:20:52.040 align:start position:0%
indicate either their support or
 
05:20:53.430 --> 05:20:53.440 align:start position:0%
opposition to the
 
05:20:55.788 --> 05:20:55.798 align:start position:0%
bill uh there were a number of people
 
05:21:01.868 --> 05:21:01.878 align:start position:0%
who supported David sad Carla gy Lewis p
 
05:21:07.628 --> 05:21:07.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:11.628 --> 05:21:11.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:16.390 --> 05:21:16.400 align:start position:0%
silver and Alvin Alvin C there were two
 
05:21:19.030 --> 05:21:19.040 align:start position:0%
people who signed up in opposition who
 
05:21:20.948 --> 05:21:20.958 align:start position:0%
indicated that they did not intend to
 
05:21:23.948 --> 05:21:23.958 align:start position:0%
speak one was Julie Gilman indicated she
 
05:21:27.548 --> 05:21:27.558 align:start position:0%
was an elected official from exor and
 
05:21:27.558 --> 05:21:29.270 align:start position:0%
was an elected official from exor and
Christina

05:21:29.270 --> 05:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
Christina
 
05:21:32.670 --> 05:21:32.680 align:start position:0%
Barrett uh who represents the New
 
05:21:35.830 --> 05:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:38.590 --> 05:21:38.600 align:start position:0%
Association and if there's no further
 
05:21:41.230 --> 05:21:41.240 align:start position:0%
testimony then we'll close the hearing
 
05:21:44.350 --> 05:21:44.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:51.868 --> 05:21:51.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:54.470 --> 05:21:54.480 align:start position:0%
for one of one of the things that we
 
05:21:55.910 --> 05:21:55.920 align:start position:0%
could consider
 
05:21:59.470 --> 05:21:59.480 align:start position:0%
doing uh as opposed to the prior session
 
05:22:02.708 --> 05:22:02.718 align:start position:0%
where you couldn't have any executive
 
05:22:05.910 --> 05:22:05.920 align:start position:0%
session uh on the same day that we heard
 
05:22:05.920 --> 05:22:07.470 align:start position:0%
session uh on the same day that we heard
a

05:22:07.470 --> 05:22:07.480 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:22:10.750 --> 05:22:10.760 align:start position:0%
bill we under the current circumstances
 
05:22:12.590 --> 05:22:12.600 align:start position:0%
we've agreed to do that but I as I
 
05:22:14.868 --> 05:22:14.878 align:start position:0%
indicated when we met before I wouldn't
 
05:22:17.628 --> 05:22:17.638 align:start position:0%
do that unless I felt that was the
 
05:22:19.030 --> 05:22:19.040 align:start position:0%
appropriate thing to do but I was
 
05:22:20.670 --> 05:22:20.680 align:start position:0%
wondering if the committee would be
 
05:22:22.910 --> 05:22:22.920 align:start position:0%
interested with regard to the first bill
 
05:22:24.990 --> 05:22:25.000 align:start position:0%
that we heard today where there seemed
 
05:22:28.510 --> 05:22:28.520 align:start position:0%
to be General agreement even among the
 
05:22:30.750 --> 05:22:30.760 align:start position:0%
sponsors with regard to retaining the
 
05:22:30.760 --> 05:22:31.670 align:start position:0%
sponsors with regard to retaining the
bill

05:22:31.670 --> 05:22:31.680 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:22:35.430 --> 05:22:35.440 align:start position:0%
whether you the committee might consider
 
05:22:38.750 --> 05:22:38.760 align:start position:0%
going into executive session to consider
 
05:22:42.190 --> 05:22:42.200 align:start position:0%
that possibility and I I
 
05:22:45.070 --> 05:22:45.080 align:start position:0%
might first inquire of Representative
 
05:22:47.230 --> 05:22:47.240 align:start position:0%
Smith if she feels that that would be
 
05:22:47.240 --> 05:22:50.390 align:start position:0%
Smith if she feels that that would be
appropriate

05:22:50.390 --> 05:22:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:54.990 --> 05:22:55.000 align:start position:0%
today thank you um U Mr chairman yes I
 
05:22:59.628 --> 05:22:59.638 align:start position:0%
think given the circumstances um of the
 
05:23:01.470 --> 05:23:01.480 align:start position:0%
uh univers
 
05:23:05.110 --> 05:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
belief that this was a bill that um had
 
05:23:08.030 --> 05:23:08.040 align:start position:0%
Merit but would require more work I
 
05:23:09.628 --> 05:23:09.638 align:start position:0%
would think that if you wanted to
 
05:23:12.230 --> 05:23:12.240 align:start position:0%
entertain a motion to
 
05:23:17.470 --> 05:23:17.480 align:start position:0%
retain um House Bill 248 that that would
 
05:23:22.230 --> 05:23:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:25.750 --> 05:23:25.760 align:start position:0%
time and I'm presuming that we have to
 
05:23:28.708 --> 05:23:28.718 align:start position:0%
actually move to go into executive
 
05:23:31.868 --> 05:23:31.878 align:start position:0%
session yes Mr chair
 
05:23:31.878 --> 05:23:34.430 align:start position:0%
session yes Mr chair
and

05:23:34.430 --> 05:23:34.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:23:37.230 --> 05:23:37.240 align:start position:0%
so and was was that a formal motion to
 
05:23:39.590 --> 05:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
do so Mr chair I would if you would
 
05:23:43.310 --> 05:23:43.320 align:start position:0%
entertain a motion I would move that the
 
05:23:46.948 --> 05:23:46.958 align:start position:0%
uh Judiciary Committee go into executive
 
05:23:49.628 --> 05:23:49.638 align:start position:0%
session at this
 
05:23:53.270 --> 05:23:53.280 align:start position:0%
time second okay it's been seconded by
 
05:23:53.280 --> 05:23:54.990 align:start position:0%
time second okay it's been seconded by
representative

05:23:54.990 --> 05:23:55.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:23:59.470 --> 05:23:59.480 align:start position:0%
rice and moved by representative Smith
 
05:24:01.390 --> 05:24:01.400 align:start position:0%
to go into executive session
 
05:24:03.910 --> 05:24:03.920 align:start position:0%
and that requires a roll call vote and
 
05:24:14.230 --> 05:24:14.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:17.470 --> 05:24:17.480 align:start position:0%
rooll got the clerk by
 
05:24:22.310 --> 05:24:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:26.190 --> 05:24:26.200 align:start position:0%
already Mr chair I have a quick question
 
05:24:29.310 --> 05:24:29.320 align:start position:0%
yes uh given that we're about to go into
 
05:24:31.390 --> 05:24:31.400 align:start position:0%
executive session just a reminder that
 
05:24:34.030 --> 05:24:34.040 align:start position:0%
everybody is supposed to be on video

great setup um for my bill this my bill
 
05:42:14.360 --> 05:42:15.468 align:start position:0%
great setup um for my bill this my bill
is

05:42:15.468 --> 05:42:15.478 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:42:22.110 --> 05:42:22.120 align:start position:0%
um trying to address uh the the the
 
05:42:24.670 --> 05:42:24.680 align:start position:0%
right to know law is trying to balance
 
05:42:28.270 --> 05:42:28.280 align:start position:0%
the Public's right to know uh what
 
05:42:32.310 --> 05:42:32.320 align:start position:0%
happens in non-public meetings with the
 
05:42:34.830 --> 05:42:34.840 align:start position:0%
harm that such knowledge could impose on
 
05:42:37.350 --> 05:42:37.360 align:start position:0%
individuals and the community as a whole
 
05:42:40.590 --> 05:42:40.600 align:start position:0%
and only allows the minutes to be kept
 
05:42:43.310 --> 05:42:43.320 align:start position:0%
secret under specific circumstances and
 
05:42:45.868 --> 05:42:45.878 align:start position:0%
states the Public's right to know may
 
05:42:49.468 --> 05:42:49.478 align:start position:0%
only be withheld until the circumstances
 
05:42:52.670 --> 05:42:52.680 align:start position:0%
no longer apply that made them conclude
 
05:42:55.468 --> 05:42:55.478 align:start position:0%
the damage would outweigh the benefits
 
05:42:57.070 --> 05:42:57.080 align:start position:0%
of keeping that information from the
 
05:42:59.670 --> 05:42:59.680 align:start position:0%
public but the law does not set up a
 
05:43:02.110 --> 05:43:02.120 align:start position:0%
method for the boards to
 
05:43:04.910 --> 05:43:04.920 align:start position:0%
re-evaluate the circumstances that might
 
05:43:08.910 --> 05:43:08.920 align:start position:0%
change that cost benefit analysis over
 
05:43:11.830 --> 05:43:11.840 align:start position:0%
time it instead relies on the boards to
 
05:43:14.030 --> 05:43:14.040 align:start position:0%
have the wherewithal to go back and
 
05:43:16.430 --> 05:43:16.440 align:start position:0%
reconsider an issue that is not
 
05:43:19.110 --> 05:43:19.120 align:start position:0%
currently before the board this is not
 
05:43:21.070 --> 05:43:21.080 align:start position:0%
happening as non-public meetings one
 
05:43:23.990 --> 05:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
sealed are often never looked at
 
05:43:26.990 --> 05:43:27.000 align:start position:0%
again I would like to see the boards
 
05:43:28.510 --> 05:43:28.520 align:start position:0%
address whether or not is still
 
05:43:28.520 --> 05:43:30.030 align:start position:0%
address whether or not is still
appropriate

05:43:30.030 --> 05:43:30.040 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
05:43:31.670 --> 05:43:31.680 align:start position:0%
that the public be kept in the dark
 
05:43:33.548 --> 05:43:33.558 align:start position:0%
about what happened in these nonpublic
 
05:43:36.190 --> 05:43:36.200 align:start position:0%
sessions as the law seems to imply that
 
05:43:39.510 --> 05:43:39.520 align:start position:0%
they should however we do not create the
 
05:43:44.230 --> 05:43:44.240 align:start position:0%
rules or incentives to do that um and I
 
05:43:47.510 --> 05:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
propose that we ask these boards um to
 
05:43:50.190 --> 05:43:50.200 align:start position:0%
take a look at these minutes
 
05:43:53.990 --> 05:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
um on a yearly basis is my suggestion
 
05:43:55.990 --> 05:43:56.000 align:start position:0%
and if they don't then the minutes would
 
05:43:59.670 --> 05:43:59.680 align:start position:0%
automatically be unsealed however when I
 
05:44:02.110 --> 05:44:02.120 align:start position:0%
proposed uh a bill to that effect last
 
05:44:05.750 --> 05:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
year there was cons um expressed some
 
05:44:09.548 --> 05:44:09.558 align:start position:0%
concerns with something being unvert
 
05:44:12.910 --> 05:44:12.920 align:start position:0%
unsealed and so it was Pro proposed to
 
05:44:15.910 --> 05:44:15.920 align:start position:0%
only address a sealing of non-public
 
05:44:18.830 --> 05:44:18.840 align:start position:0%
meetings held to to discuss the
 
05:44:21.468 --> 05:44:21.478 align:start position:0%
acquisition sale or lease of real
 
05:44:24.070 --> 05:44:24.080 align:start position:0%
personal property as the damage from
 
05:44:25.628 --> 05:44:25.638 align:start position:0%
such information accidentally being
 
05:44:28.990 --> 05:44:29.000 align:start position:0%
released is just to the risk of that
 
05:44:32.510 --> 05:44:32.520 align:start position:0%
single deal and uh something
 
05:44:34.350 --> 05:44:34.360 align:start position:0%
which is
 
05:44:37.430 --> 05:44:37.440 align:start position:0%
circumstances uh
 
05:44:41.548 --> 05:44:41.558 align:start position:0%
can be changed over time and likely to
 
05:44:43.948 --> 05:44:43.958 align:start position:0%
the um the reasons for sealing such
 
05:44:46.750 --> 05:44:46.760 align:start position:0%
minutes would likely no longer apply you
 
05:44:49.670 --> 05:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
know in the one to three years after
 
05:44:55.270 --> 05:44:55.280 align:start position:0%
that meeting took place so I um was
 
05:44:57.708 --> 05:44:57.718 align:start position:0%
happy to hear that the right to know New
 
05:45:00.070 --> 05:45:00.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire supports my
 
05:45:06.190 --> 05:45:06.200 align:start position:0%
idea uh and but they proposed uh uh an
 
05:45:09.190 --> 05:45:09.200 align:start position:0%
amendment to my to my
 
05:45:12.430 --> 05:45:12.440 align:start position:0%
uh proposed language which I'm sure you
 
05:45:16.468 --> 05:45:16.478 align:start position:0%
will hear about and um their proposal
 
05:45:19.590 --> 05:45:19.600 align:start position:0%
was essentially to just automatically
 
05:45:22.708 --> 05:45:22.718 align:start position:0%
unseal these these minutes once the
 
05:45:24.788 --> 05:45:24.798 align:start position:0%
contract is
 
05:45:27.590 --> 05:45:27.600 align:start position:0%
finalized and I have a couple of issues
 
05:45:31.948 --> 05:45:31.958 align:start position:0%
with with that proposal language and so
 
05:45:35.510 --> 05:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
um in the interest of getting my my
 
05:45:38.510 --> 05:45:38.520 align:start position:0%
comments out there uh so that you don't
 
05:45:40.510 --> 05:45:40.520 align:start position:0%
have to come back to me my my first
 
05:45:45.390 --> 05:45:45.400 align:start position:0%
issue is that is that this is kind of a
 
05:45:49.628 --> 05:45:49.638 align:start position:0%
uh test of the concept of resealing
 
05:45:52.510 --> 05:45:52.520 align:start position:0%
minutes to allow the sealing of minutes
 
05:45:52.520 --> 05:45:54.190 align:start position:0%
minutes to allow the sealing of minutes
to

05:45:54.190 --> 05:45:54.200 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:45:57.510 --> 05:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
um or allowing the ceiling of minutes to
 
05:45:59.948 --> 05:45:59.958 align:start position:0%
expire and expand that concept if it
 
05:46:03.030 --> 05:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
works in this test case so changing the
 
05:46:05.510 --> 05:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
direction of the bill
 
05:46:05.520 --> 05:46:07.230 align:start position:0%
direction of the bill
would

05:46:07.230 --> 05:46:07.240 align:start position:0%
would
 
05:46:10.670 --> 05:46:10.680 align:start position:0%
more make this a one-off solution and
 
05:46:14.150 --> 05:46:14.160 align:start position:0%
not really um help the legislature
 
05:46:14.160 --> 05:46:15.468 align:start position:0%
not really um help the legislature
address

05:46:15.468 --> 05:46:15.478 align:start position:0%
address
 
05:46:20.070 --> 05:46:20.080 align:start position:0%
the bigger issue of of encouraging
 
05:46:22.390 --> 05:46:22.400 align:start position:0%
boards to re-evaluate the ceiling of
 
05:46:22.400 --> 05:46:23.510 align:start position:0%
boards to re-evaluate the ceiling of
minutes

05:46:23.510 --> 05:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
05:46:26.670 --> 05:46:26.680 align:start position:0%
regularly and whether or not that
 
05:46:29.868 --> 05:46:29.878 align:start position:0%
sealing of minutes is still approp roate
 
05:46:33.750 --> 05:46:33.760 align:start position:0%
and secondly um if the committee decides
 
05:46:35.990 --> 05:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
that it would like to address the
 
05:46:37.628 --> 05:46:37.638 align:start position:0%
acquisition of property Alone by
 
05:46:40.150 --> 05:46:40.160 align:start position:0%
adopting the proposed amendment I think
 
05:46:42.510 --> 05:46:42.520 align:start position:0%
that the language has a flaw that the
 
05:46:45.350 --> 05:46:45.360 align:start position:0%
proposal assumes the purchase occurs and
 
05:46:48.150 --> 05:46:48.160 align:start position:0%
does not open up the minute um if the
 
05:46:49.830 --> 05:46:49.840 align:start position:0%
deal ends up falling
 
05:46:54.390 --> 05:46:54.400 align:start position:0%
through and so with those concerns I
 
05:46:56.990 --> 05:46:57.000 align:start position:0%
hope that the uh committee supports the
 
05:46:59.350 --> 05:46:59.360 align:start position:0%
leg legislation as written
 
05:47:02.110 --> 05:47:02.120 align:start position:0%
and I would be happy to take any
 
05:47:09.670 --> 05:47:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:12.948 --> 05:47:12.958 align:start position:0%
representa I don't see any questions
 
05:47:16.030 --> 05:47:16.040 align:start position:0%

05:48:26.670 --> 05:48:26.680 align:start position:0%
bill with an amendment um as was
 
05:48:29.430 --> 05:48:29.440 align:start position:0%
mentioned by rep Yella
 
05:48:31.788 --> 05:48:31.798 align:start position:0%
um and I'll get to those details in a
 
05:48:35.350 --> 05:48:35.360 align:start position:0%
moment um minutes and decisions reached
 
05:48:38.030 --> 05:48:38.040 align:start position:0%
in non-public sessions used to discuss
 
05:48:39.948 --> 05:48:39.958 align:start position:0%
the acquisition sale or lease of
 
05:48:42.150 --> 05:48:42.160 align:start position:0%
property are often sealed because the
 
05:48:44.910 --> 05:48:44.920 align:start position:0%
release of minutes to the public could
 
05:48:47.628 --> 05:48:47.638 align:start position:0%
render the proposed action
 
05:48:49.910 --> 05:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
ineffective in this case the information
 
05:48:52.390 --> 05:48:52.400 align:start position:0%
may be withheld until the circumstances
 
05:48:55.430 --> 05:48:55.440 align:start position:0%
that would render the proposed action
 
05:48:58.628 --> 05:48:58.638 align:start position:0%
ineffective no longer apply this is the
 
05:49:01.150 --> 05:49:01.160 align:start position:0%
current law as it stands
 
05:49:04.070 --> 05:49:04.080 align:start position:0%
today once a contractual commitment to
 
05:49:06.990 --> 05:49:07.000 align:start position:0%
acquire sell or lease property has been
 
05:49:09.628 --> 05:49:09.638 align:start position:0%
signed by all parties the proposed
 
05:49:12.510 --> 05:49:12.520 align:start position:0%
action has been finalized upon contract
 
05:49:15.350 --> 05:49:15.360 align:start position:0%
signing the proposed action has become
 
05:49:18.590 --> 05:49:18.600 align:start position:0%
effective and binding on all parties so
 
05:49:20.230 --> 05:49:20.240 align:start position:0%
the circumstances for sealing the
 
05:49:23.788 --> 05:49:23.798 align:start position:0%
minutes no longer applies and public
 
05:49:25.868 --> 05:49:25.878 align:start position:0%
release of the minutes can no
 
05:49:28.830 --> 05:49:28.840 align:start position:0%
longer consider uh be considered as
 
05:49:32.548 --> 05:49:32.558 align:start position:0%
rendering the proposed action
 
05:49:36.030 --> 05:49:36.040 align:start position:0%
ineffective uh since the preamble to the
 
05:49:42.030 --> 05:49:42.040 align:start position:0%
right to no law states that we have the
 
05:49:44.750 --> 05:49:44.760 align:start position:0%
uh requirement for an open government
 
05:49:46.708 --> 05:49:46.718 align:start position:0%
which is accessible and accountable to
 
05:49:50.788 --> 05:49:50.798 align:start position:0%
the people uh we should interpret the
 
05:49:53.070 --> 05:49:53.080 align:start position:0%
existing law that the release of the
 
05:49:57.150 --> 05:49:57.160 align:start position:0%
minutes should happen after contract
 
05:49:59.510 --> 05:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
finalization uh but often this does not
 
05:50:01.910 --> 05:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
happen I believe the law needs to be
 
05:50:04.270 --> 05:50:04.280 align:start position:0%
clarified to make this requirement
 
05:50:08.190 --> 05:50:08.200 align:start position:0%
clear uh as such we are suggesting an
 
05:50:09.510 --> 05:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
amendment to the
 
05:50:13.310 --> 05:50:13.320 align:start position:0%
language such that it would read uh that
 
05:50:15.310 --> 05:50:15.320 align:start position:0%
an exception shall apply to those
 
05:50:18.948 --> 05:50:18.958 align:start position:0%
minutes generated from subparagraph
 
05:50:22.190 --> 05:50:22.200 align:start position:0%
2D which may be unsealed at any time but
 
05:50:24.788 --> 05:50:24.798 align:start position:0%
which will automatically be unsealed
 
05:50:27.430 --> 05:50:27.440 align:start position:0%
after closing or contract
 
05:50:32.350 --> 05:50:32.360 align:start position:0%
finalization to rep's point uh we could
 
05:50:34.110 --> 05:50:34.120 align:start position:0%
also add
 
05:50:37.030 --> 05:50:37.040 align:start position:0%
termination as well to cover that
 
05:50:41.270 --> 05:50:41.280 align:start position:0%
condition um I do I do appreciate rep
 
05:50:45.510 --> 05:50:45.520 align:start position:0%
y's um sort of uh overarching goal which
 
05:50:48.830 --> 05:50:48.840 align:start position:0%
is to address the problem that does
 
05:50:52.670 --> 05:50:52.680 align:start position:0%
exist around uh minutes getting
 
05:50:55.590 --> 05:50:55.600 align:start position:0%
sealed and then those minutes remaining
 
05:50:59.190 --> 05:50:59.200 align:start position:0%
sealed long after the
 
05:51:02.590 --> 05:51:02.600 align:start position:0%
circumstances no longer apply this is a
 
05:51:04.948 --> 05:51:04.958 align:start position:0%
ongoing problem with the law it is
 
05:51:09.830 --> 05:51:09.840 align:start position:0%
currently written um since his uh bill
 
05:51:12.948 --> 05:51:12.958 align:start position:0%
is really addressing only the
 
05:51:15.990 --> 05:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
acquisition uh uh in purchase sale of
 
05:51:16.000 --> 05:51:17.590 align:start position:0%
acquisition uh uh in purchase sale of
property

05:51:17.590 --> 05:51:17.600 align:start position:0%
property
 
05:51:21.350 --> 05:51:21.360 align:start position:0%
exemption um the amended language that
 
05:51:24.430 --> 05:51:24.440 align:start position:0%
uh we're suggesting kind of fits with
 
05:51:28.390 --> 05:51:28.400 align:start position:0%
that loan um exemption the other thing
 
05:51:34.190 --> 05:51:34.200 align:start position:0%
thing that I would note is that back in
 
05:51:37.910 --> 05:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
2015 uh we drafted a bill which was
 
05:51:39.390 --> 05:51:39.400 align:start position:0%
passed HB
 
05:51:45.628 --> 05:51:45.638 align:start position:0%
108 which uh caused the language uh in
 
05:51:48.590 --> 05:51:48.600 align:start position:0%
this section to be
 
05:51:52.270 --> 05:51:52.280 align:start position:0%
updated uh to require that the
 
05:51:56.468 --> 05:51:56.478 align:start position:0%
vote to seal the minutes is done in a
 
05:51:59.750 --> 05:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
public session and again that's current
 
05:51:59.760 --> 05:52:00.868 align:start position:0%
public session and again that's current
law

05:52:00.868 --> 05:52:00.878 align:start position:0%
law
 
05:52:05.788 --> 05:52:05.798 align:start position:0%
today uh in this amendment it's talking
 
05:52:07.910 --> 05:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
about automatically
 
05:52:09.948 --> 05:52:09.958 align:start position:0%
unsealing uh the
 
05:52:15.110 --> 05:52:15.120 align:start position:0%
records uh after a year but if the uh
 
05:52:18.150 --> 05:52:18.160 align:start position:0%
board were to vote to continue to
 
05:52:21.110 --> 05:52:21.120 align:start position:0%
maintain the cealing of those records
 
05:52:23.270 --> 05:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
the language here says that vote is in
 
05:52:25.948 --> 05:52:25.958 align:start position:0%
non-public session and I would also
 
05:52:28.750 --> 05:52:28.760 align:start position:0%
suggest an amendment that would require
 
05:52:33.430 --> 05:52:33.440 align:start position:0%
the vote to continue to seal the minutes
 
05:52:36.150 --> 05:52:36.160 align:start position:0%
should also be done in a public
 
05:52:39.070 --> 05:52:39.080 align:start position:0%
session again the discussion around
 
05:52:41.390 --> 05:52:41.400 align:start position:0%
whether or not to seal the minutes or to
 
05:52:44.350 --> 05:52:44.360 align:start position:0%
continue to seal the minutes would occur
 
05:52:47.990 --> 05:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
in non-public but the actual vote of
 
05:52:51.750 --> 05:52:51.760 align:start position:0%
cealing minutes in all instances should
 
05:52:54.150 --> 05:52:54.160 align:start position:0%
be done in a public session so that we
 
05:52:57.548 --> 05:52:57.558 align:start position:0%
can have the utmost transparency of how
 
05:53:01.910 --> 05:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
our elected officials are voting on our
 
05:53:05.548 --> 05:53:05.558 align:start position:0%
behalf thank you very much and I um
 
05:53:07.350 --> 05:53:07.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to offer
 
05:53:09.990 --> 05:53:10.000 align:start position:0%
testimony and I'll take any questions
 
05:53:13.628 --> 05:53:13.638 align:start position:0%
represent mlan yeah thank you Mr chair
 
05:53:15.910 --> 05:53:15.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question the
 
05:53:18.628 --> 05:53:18.638 align:start position:0%
original intention of this bill as it
 
05:53:21.590 --> 05:53:21.600 align:start position:0%
was presented in the last term by
 
05:53:23.350 --> 05:53:23.360 align:start position:0%
understanding was
 
05:53:27.310 --> 05:53:27.320 align:start position:0%
that we wanted to release all of the
 
05:53:30.628 --> 05:53:30.638 align:start position:0%
provisions after one year and some of
 
05:53:33.708 --> 05:53:33.718 align:start position:0%
the feedback getting at that time is
 
05:53:36.030 --> 05:53:36.040 align:start position:0%
that you may have very sensitive
 
05:53:37.868 --> 05:53:37.878 align:start position:0%
information that if it's just
 
05:53:40.868 --> 05:53:40.878 align:start position:0%
automatically disclosed to do an
 
05:53:44.230 --> 05:53:44.240 align:start position:0%
enormous amount of harm so my
 
05:53:46.190 --> 05:53:46.200 align:start position:0%
understanding with the intention of this
 
05:53:49.708 --> 05:53:49.718 align:start position:0%
bill was more Broad and that it wanted
 
05:53:51.910 --> 05:53:51.920 align:start position:0%
to pick something that was relatively
 
05:53:54.230 --> 05:53:54.240 align:start position:0%
harmless so that it would give people
 
05:53:56.590 --> 05:53:56.600 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to develop the
 
05:53:59.708 --> 05:53:59.718 align:start position:0%
mechanisms around that un stealing at
 
05:54:03.390 --> 05:54:03.400 align:start position:0%
the end of that year so um I would just
 
05:54:07.628 --> 05:54:07.638 align:start position:0%
say that if the intention is develop
 
05:54:10.350 --> 05:54:10.360 align:start position:0%
mechanisms around ultimately being able
 
05:54:12.788 --> 05:54:12.798 align:start position:0%
to unal more than just this one
 
05:54:15.510 --> 05:54:15.520 align:start position:0%
subparagraph after a year that the
 
05:54:17.990 --> 05:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
language is saying fact but if you were
 
05:54:22.390 --> 05:54:22.400 align:start position:0%
looking to go and just go after you know
 
05:54:25.270 --> 05:54:25.280 align:start position:0%
this targeted self paragraph then I
 
05:54:27.590 --> 05:54:27.600 align:start position:0%
think what you're saying makes sense so
 
05:54:28.628 --> 05:54:28.638 align:start position:0%
I guess
 
05:54:31.628 --> 05:54:31.638 align:start position:0%
just the question is what do you guys
 
05:54:34.350 --> 05:54:34.360 align:start position:0%
see as the intention of this legislation
 
05:54:37.548 --> 05:54:37.558 align:start position:0%
is it to develop this broader mechanism
 
05:54:40.110 --> 05:54:40.120 align:start position:0%
or is it to just go after this specific
 
05:54:40.120 --> 05:54:43.030 align:start position:0%
or is it to just go after this specific
subar

05:54:43.030 --> 05:54:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:45.628 --> 05:54:45.638 align:start position:0%
paragraph well I think most
 
05:54:48.070 --> 05:54:48.080 align:start position:0%
appropriately that's a question for the
 
05:54:50.868 --> 05:54:50.878 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill um if this bill was
 
05:54:53.510 --> 05:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
not uh written by right to know New
 
05:54:57.468 --> 05:54:57.478 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um so I would defer to rep
 
05:55:02.390 --> 05:55:02.400 align:start position:0%
yoka to uh to answer that um what I
 
05:55:05.350 --> 05:55:05.360 align:start position:0%
would like to add is that from our
 
05:55:08.030 --> 05:55:08.040 align:start position:0%
perspective right to know New Hampshire
 
05:55:10.548 --> 05:55:10.558 align:start position:0%
recognizes that there's an ongoing
 
05:55:14.990 --> 05:55:15.000 align:start position:0%
problem with the fact of uh minutes
 
05:55:20.030 --> 05:55:20.040 align:start position:0%
being sealed initially and then uh even
 
05:55:22.150 --> 05:55:22.160 align:start position:0%
though the circumstances for sealing
 
05:55:24.430 --> 05:55:24.440 align:start position:0%
those minutes at some point in the
 
05:55:27.670 --> 05:55:27.680 align:start position:0%
future no longer apply and thus should
 
05:55:32.110 --> 05:55:32.120 align:start position:0%
be made public uh in practice that
 
05:55:35.990 --> 05:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
infrequently takes place because uh what
 
05:55:38.708 --> 05:55:38.718 align:start position:0%
we find happens is you know this the
 
05:55:41.070 --> 05:55:41.080 align:start position:0%
selectman or whatever the public body is
 
05:55:43.708 --> 05:55:43.718 align:start position:0%
they're moving on to other business and
 
05:55:46.390 --> 05:55:46.400 align:start position:0%
they're not bothering to revisit
 
05:55:48.868 --> 05:55:48.878 align:start position:0%
decisions they made six months ago a
 
05:55:54.510 --> 05:55:54.520 align:start position:0%
year ago uh about sealing minutes uh
 
05:55:56.990 --> 05:55:57.000 align:start position:0%
that took place in the past and thus
 
05:56:00.670 --> 05:56:00.680 align:start position:0%
they stay sealed forever and I I would
 
05:56:05.310 --> 05:56:05.320 align:start position:0%
use this opportunity also you know as a
 
05:56:07.548 --> 05:56:07.558 align:start position:0%
um you know to make mention that there
 
05:56:09.310 --> 05:56:09.320 align:start position:0%
is a another bill that's going to be
 
05:56:12.190 --> 05:56:12.200 align:start position:0%
discussed in another session um that
 
05:56:15.910 --> 05:56:15.920 align:start position:0%
does address um keeping a list of
 
05:56:18.030 --> 05:56:18.040 align:start position:0%
minutes that have been sealed so that
 
05:56:19.590 --> 05:56:19.600 align:start position:0%
there's greater
 
05:56:22.150 --> 05:56:22.160 align:start position:0%
visibility towards these minutes that
 
05:56:26.628 --> 05:56:26.638 align:start position:0%
are going unsealed so this is a um a
 
05:56:29.390 --> 05:56:29.400 align:start position:0%
step in the right direction to address
 
05:56:29.400 --> 05:56:30.270 align:start position:0%
step in the right direction to address
the

05:56:30.270 --> 05:56:30.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:56:36.830 --> 05:56:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:39.190 --> 05:56:39.200 align:start position:0%
question okay are there any other
 
05:56:42.910 --> 05:56:42.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:46.430 --> 05:56:46.440 align:start position:0%
sad if not thank you for your testimony
 
05:56:50.830 --> 05:56:50.840 align:start position:0%

05:57:13.868 --> 05:57:13.878 align:start position:0%
Association um and I signed in in
 
05:57:16.788 --> 05:57:16.798 align:start position:0%
opposition to the bill uh actually we
 
05:57:18.670 --> 05:57:18.680 align:start position:0%
support part of the
 
05:57:22.590 --> 05:57:22.600 align:start position:0%
bill um and I
 
05:57:25.548 --> 05:57:25.558 align:start position:0%
guess opposed part of the bill the the
 
05:57:28.190 --> 05:57:28.200 align:start position:0%
first thing I would say is we actually
 
05:57:31.830 --> 05:57:31.840 align:start position:0%
do like section one of the bill which I
 
05:57:33.310 --> 05:57:33.320 align:start position:0%
don't think any anyone has actually
 
05:57:36.070 --> 05:57:36.080 align:start position:0%
talked about yet
 
05:57:39.750 --> 05:57:39.760 align:start position:0%
um this would allow the consideration
 
05:57:43.070 --> 05:57:43.080 align:start position:0%
not the vote but the consideration of
 
05:57:45.430 --> 05:57:45.440 align:start position:0%
whether to unseal
 
05:57:50.390 --> 05:57:50.400 align:start position:0%
minutes um would allow that discussion
 
05:57:55.110 --> 05:57:55.120 align:start position:0%
to occur in nonpublic session and uh we
 
05:57:58.708 --> 05:57:58.718 align:start position:0%
think that that's that that makes sense
 
05:58:00.670 --> 05:58:00.680 align:start position:0%
I I will add and this is a this is a
 
05:58:03.548 --> 05:58:03.558 align:start position:0%
technical thing um although people
 
05:58:06.230 --> 05:58:06.240 align:start position:0%
always talk about sealing or unsealing
 
05:58:09.070 --> 05:58:09.080 align:start position:0%
minutes the right to no
 
05:58:13.190 --> 05:58:13.200 align:start position:0%
law the word the term seal the minutes
 
05:58:16.070 --> 05:58:16.080 align:start position:0%
actually does not appear anywhere in RSA
 
05:58:18.390 --> 05:58:18.400 align:start position:0%
91a if you if you search for the word
 
05:58:24.390 --> 05:58:24.400 align:start position:0%
seal it's not in there the um the what
 
05:58:27.350 --> 05:58:27.360 align:start position:0%
the language is is that minutes must be
 
05:58:27.360 --> 05:58:28.590 align:start position:0%
the language is is that minutes must be
disclosed

05:58:28.590 --> 05:58:28.600 align:start position:0%
disclosed
 
05:58:30.948 --> 05:58:30.958 align:start position:0%
closed non-public minuts must be
 
05:58:34.590 --> 05:58:34.600 align:start position:0%
disclosed unless the board votes not to
 
05:58:38.150 --> 05:58:38.160 align:start position:0%
disclose them so I would actually in
 
05:58:39.708 --> 05:58:39.718 align:start position:0%
section one
 
05:58:42.590 --> 05:58:42.600 align:start position:0%
on line three rather than say
 
05:58:44.868 --> 05:58:44.878 align:start position:0%
consideration of whether to unseal
 
05:58:47.230 --> 05:58:47.240 align:start position:0%
minutes I would say consideration of
 
05:58:51.750 --> 05:58:51.760 align:start position:0%
whether to dis minutes um that's a
 
05:58:53.270 --> 05:58:53.280 align:start position:0%
that's a technical point but I think
 
05:58:54.868 --> 05:58:54.878 align:start position:0%
it's I think we ought to have the
 
05:58:54.878 --> 05:58:56.628 align:start position:0%
it's I think we ought to have the
language

05:58:56.628 --> 05:58:56.638 align:start position:0%
language
 
05:58:59.510 --> 05:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
consistent as far as uh what most of the
 
05:59:00.948 --> 05:59:00.958 align:start position:0%
discussion has
 
05:59:04.310 --> 05:59:04.320 align:start position:0%
been uh we are concerned
 
05:59:08.830 --> 05:59:08.840 align:start position:0%
about uh just selecting one category of
 
05:59:10.750 --> 05:59:10.760 align:start position:0%
of sealed
 
05:59:14.510 --> 05:59:14.520 align:start position:0%
minutes uh and subjecting them to to an
 
05:59:16.788 --> 05:59:16.798 align:start position:0%
arbitrary timeline after which they
 
05:59:18.990 --> 05:59:19.000 align:start position:0%
would automatically be
 
05:59:23.070 --> 05:59:23.080 align:start position:0%
unsealed I if I if I understood the
 
05:59:27.030 --> 05:59:27.040 align:start position:0%
suggestion made made by David sad from
 
05:59:28.990 --> 05:59:29.000 align:start position:0%
right to know Hampshire if I understand
 
05:59:30.350 --> 05:59:30.360 align:start position:0%
his suggestion
 
05:59:33.070 --> 05:59:33.080 align:start position:0%
correctly I think I like it better which
 
05:59:35.390 --> 05:59:35.400 align:start position:0%
is that they would be automatically
 
05:59:37.708 --> 05:59:37.718 align:start position:0%
unsealed and I think the language was
 
05:59:40.070 --> 05:59:40.080 align:start position:0%
something like
 
05:59:45.390 --> 05:59:45.400 align:start position:0%
um upon um upon closing or contract
 
05:59:48.548 --> 05:59:48.558 align:start position:0%
finalization or something like
 
05:59:51.190 --> 05:59:51.200 align:start position:0%
that I don't think they should I don't
 
05:59:54.270 --> 05:59:54.280 align:start position:0%
think they should be automatically
 
05:59:56.670 --> 05:59:56.680 align:start position:0%
unsealed just because a contract has
 
05:59:58.708 --> 05:59:58.718 align:start position:0%
been signed because as we all know a
 
06:00:02.430 --> 06:00:02.440 align:start position:0%
contract can fall apart uh if there's a
 
06:00:05.110 --> 06:00:05.120 align:start position:0%
condition that fails to occur or
 
06:00:08.310 --> 06:00:08.320 align:start position:0%
whatever but if the transaction has
 
06:00:12.788 --> 06:00:12.798 align:start position:0%
actually closed then uh except in very
 
06:00:15.110 --> 06:00:15.120 align:start position:0%
unusual circumstances there would be no
 
06:00:16.750 --> 06:00:16.760 align:start position:0%
reason to keep the
 
06:00:22.270 --> 06:00:22.280 align:start position:0%
minutes uh sealed so you know I although
 
06:00:24.830 --> 06:00:24.840 align:start position:0%
although really we would like to we'd be
 
06:00:28.750 --> 06:00:28.760 align:start position:0%
happy to see the law stay as it is is if
 
06:00:30.868 --> 06:00:30.878 align:start position:0%
there is a proposal to have them be
 
06:00:30.878 --> 06:00:32.430 align:start position:0%
there is a proposal to have them be
automatically

06:00:32.430 --> 06:00:32.440 align:start position:0%
automatically
 
06:00:35.628 --> 06:00:35.638 align:start position:0%
unsealed uh once the transaction has
 
06:00:35.638 --> 06:00:37.310 align:start position:0%
unsealed uh once the transaction has
actually

06:00:37.310 --> 06:00:37.320 align:start position:0%
actually
 
06:00:40.910 --> 06:00:40.920 align:start position:0%
closed um I think I think we could live
 
06:00:43.468 --> 06:00:43.478 align:start position:0%
with that and that would make some sense
 
06:00:45.990 --> 06:00:46.000 align:start position:0%
so long as there Remains the opportunity
 
06:00:49.030 --> 06:00:49.040 align:start position:0%
for the for the board
 
06:00:53.310 --> 06:00:53.320 align:start position:0%
to conclude uh to to vote not to
 
06:00:56.868 --> 06:00:56.878 align:start position:0%
disclose them if for some reason that I
 
06:00:58.510 --> 06:00:58.520 align:start position:0%
can't imagine
 
06:01:02.350 --> 06:01:02.360 align:start position:0%
that would actually uh render the action
 
06:01:04.548 --> 06:01:04.558 align:start position:0%
invalid so I guess I'd be interested in
 
06:01:07.750 --> 06:01:07.760 align:start position:0%
seeing seeing that Amendment uh and that
 
06:01:11.230 --> 06:01:11.240 align:start position:0%
may be a way to to uh get
 
06:01:15.150 --> 06:01:15.160 align:start position:0%
to get to an agreement on
 
06:01:19.230 --> 06:01:19.240 align:start position:0%
this thank you are there questions for
 
06:01:19.240 --> 06:01:23.270 align:start position:0%
this thank you are there questions for
Mr

everybody heard that but during when we
 
06:03:09.190 --> 06:03:09.200 align:start position:0%
are in exec session the cameras have to
 
06:03:12.110 --> 06:03:12.120 align:start position:0%
be on during the entire period of the
 
06:03:12.120 --> 06:03:16.590 align:start position:0%

business we're going to check on the
 
06:03:30.548 --> 06:03:30.558 align:start position:0%
issue of whether or not we need a roll
 
06:03:36.830 --> 06:03:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:40.350 --> 06:03:40.360 align:start position:0%

indicating that representative wber as
 
06:04:20.948 --> 06:04:20.958 align:start position:0%
clerk uh would be able to

obtain uh paper roll call sheets to use
 
06:04:26.750 --> 06:04:26.760 align:start position:0%
rather than having to use the computer
 
06:04:28.750 --> 06:04:28.760 align:start position:0%
might make
 
06:04:30.590 --> 06:04:30.600 align:start position:0%
happen more
 
06:04:33.468 --> 06:04:33.478 align:start position:0%
