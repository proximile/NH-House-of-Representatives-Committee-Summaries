00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:45.840 align:start position:0%
omnibus bills that was
 
00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
vetoed so we're back at it um
 
00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:52.080 align:start position:0%

00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:54.800 align:start position:0%
questions to the tax experts that are on
 
00:07:56.790 --> 00:07:56.800 align:start position:0%

have
 
00:08:08.869 --> 00:08:08.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:11.029 --> 00:08:11.039 align:start position:0%
who has asked for five minutes to speak
 
00:08:13.029 --> 00:08:13.039 align:start position:0%
in support
 
00:08:16.309 --> 00:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:19.189 --> 00:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
hello um my name is marilyn mahoney can
 
00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:20.160 align:start position:0%
you hear me
 
00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:23.280 align:start position:0%
yes okay great um i
 
00:08:26.309 --> 00:08:26.319 align:start position:0%
am speaking on behalf of a group of
 
00:08:27.909 --> 00:08:27.919 align:start position:0%
attorneys who
 
00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:30.720 align:start position:0%
uh we called ourselves the alimony
 
00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:31.680 align:start position:0%
working group
 
00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:34.640 align:start position:0%
um we had met and and developed the
 
00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:35.430 align:start position:0%
um we had met and and developed the
original

00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:35.440 align:start position:0%
original
 
00:08:37.909 --> 00:08:37.919 align:start position:0%
alimony formula for the law that is
 
00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:39.760 align:start position:0%
currently in effect
 
00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:42.080 align:start position:0%
and that bill coincidentally went into
 
00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:45.360 align:start position:0%
effect at the same time that the tax law
 
00:08:49.509 --> 00:08:49.519 align:start position:0%
changed the taxable nature of alimony
 
00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:52.320 align:start position:0%
which through our formula that we had so
 
00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:55.680 align:start position:0%
carefully developed into
 
00:08:58.150 --> 00:08:58.160 align:start position:0%
chaos well not chaos but disarray
 
00:08:58.160 --> 00:08:58.949 align:start position:0%
chaos well not chaos but disarray
because

00:08:58.949 --> 00:08:58.959 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:02.320 align:start position:0%
suddenly payors who were expecting to
 
00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:02.710 align:start position:0%
suddenly payors who were expecting to
have

00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:02.720 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:05.920 align:start position:0%
a deduction
 
00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:08.480 align:start position:0%
for their payment of alimony weren't
 
00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:11.440 align:start position:0%
going to get that deduction
 
00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:14.480 align:start position:0%
and and uh it was completely
 
00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:17.600 align:start position:0%
uh unfair for that
 
00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:20.160 align:start position:0%
those percentages to continue as they
 
00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:21.200 align:start position:0%
were so
 
00:09:24.389 --> 00:09:24.399 align:start position:0%
the alimony working group reconvened
 
00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:26.720 align:start position:0%
and we ran a number of different
 
00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:28.240 align:start position:0%
scenarios to try
 
00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
to determine what percentage
 
00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:35.600 align:start position:0%
would be would result in similar
 
00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
outcomes for both the recipient and the
 
00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
payor of alimony so that the tax
 
00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:46.800 align:start position:0%
consequences would not have a negative
 
00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:50.160 align:start position:0%
or unfairly positive
 
00:09:53.509 --> 00:09:53.519 align:start position:0%
effect on either party
 
00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
after a number of meanings and running a
 
00:09:58.070 --> 00:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
number of different scenarios
 
00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
um we were we came to the determination
 
00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:02.710 align:start position:0%
um we were we came to the determination
that

00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:02.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:06.560 align:start position:0%
uh the 23 of the difference in gross
 
00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:08.069 align:start position:0%
uh the 23 of the difference in gross
incomes

00:10:08.069 --> 00:10:08.079 align:start position:0%
incomes
 
00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:11.200 align:start position:0%
produced similar results to the 30
 
00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:14.800 align:start position:0%
that was in the original law
 
00:10:18.389 --> 00:10:18.399 align:start position:0%
so that is the primary thing that this
 
00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:22.720 align:start position:0%
bill is designed to do it also provides
 
00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:26.320 align:start position:0%
a window for people with alimony orders
 
00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:28.480 align:start position:0%
that were effective
 
00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:31.760 align:start position:0%
on or after january 2019 that is under
 
00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:31.990 align:start position:0%
on or after january 2019 that is under
the

00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:32.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:35.600 align:start position:0%
30 percent to modify
 
00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:38.480 align:start position:0%
their any any alimony orders that were
 
00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:38.870 align:start position:0%
their any any alimony orders that were
made

00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
made
 
00:10:41.829 --> 00:10:41.839 align:start position:0%
using that percentage on the basis of
 
00:10:41.839 --> 00:10:43.670 align:start position:0%
using that percentage on the basis of
the

00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
change in the tax law that window would
 
00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:47.680 align:start position:0%
be open
 
00:10:50.949 --> 00:10:50.959 align:start position:0%
for any orders uh amounting to more than
 
00:10:50.959 --> 00:10:51.670 align:start position:0%
for any orders uh amounting to more than
20

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:51.680 align:start position:0%
20
 
00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:55.040 align:start position:0%
23 percent of the difference and
 
00:10:56.710 --> 00:10:56.720 align:start position:0%
uh we we didn't want that to be an
 
00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
open-ended um
 
00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:03.680 align:start position:0%
a window for anyone to come in and
 
00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:04.310 align:start position:0%
a window for anyone to come in and
modify

00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
modify
 
00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:07.600 align:start position:0%
so we you will see in the bill that the
 
00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:09.760 align:start position:0%
request for modification must be made by
 
00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:11.320 align:start position:0%
july 1st
 
00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:14.320 align:start position:0%
2022 which we felt was a
 
00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
fair enough period of time to allow
 
00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
any modif uh requested modifications
 
00:11:23.509 --> 00:11:23.519 align:start position:0%
on the basis of that percentage change
 
00:11:25.509 --> 00:11:25.519 align:start position:0%
to be made
 
00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
the 30 percent alimony formula
 
00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
took effect on january 1st 2019 as i
 
00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:32.470 align:start position:0%
took effect on january 1st 2019 as i
said

00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:32.480 align:start position:0%
said
 
00:11:36.949 --> 00:11:36.959 align:start position:0%
um prior to that date divorcing parties
 
00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:39.200 align:start position:0%
could under the law choose to use the
 
00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:40.069 align:start position:0%
could under the law choose to use the
formula

00:11:40.069 --> 00:11:40.079 align:start position:0%
formula
 
00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:43.600 align:start position:0%
and many did and um either
 
00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
by court order or in settlement
 
00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:47.030 align:start position:0%
by court order or in settlement
negotiations

00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
negotiations
 
00:11:51.269 --> 00:11:51.279 align:start position:0%
so if the divorce was effective in 2018
 
00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:54.880 align:start position:0%
the 30 formula works as the new tax law
 
00:11:57.030 --> 00:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
continues alimony deductibility for
 
00:11:59.829 --> 00:11:59.839 align:start position:0%
those cases
 
00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:02.800 align:start position:0%
another provision adds the impact of
 
00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
federal tax law
 
00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:07.360 align:start position:0%
on the parties that's a quote impact of
 
00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:09.440 align:start position:0%
federal tax law on the parties if that's
 
00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:11.360 align:start position:0%
gets added to the list of special
 
00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:12.870 align:start position:0%
gets added to the list of special
circumstances

00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:12.880 align:start position:0%
circumstances
 
00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:16.240 align:start position:0%
that judges may use uh to
 
00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
uh make adjustments to the formula so if
 
00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:20.480 align:start position:0%
there were some
 
00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
unfairness uh resulting from the
 
00:12:26.069 --> 00:12:26.079 align:start position:0%
taxability the courts would have the
 
00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
authorization to excuse me to make such
 
00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:30.310 align:start position:0%
authorization to excuse me to make such
modifications

00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:30.320 align:start position:0%
modifications
 
00:12:32.069 --> 00:12:32.079 align:start position:0%
and it also clarifies that any
 
00:12:34.629 --> 00:12:34.639 align:start position:0%
modifications of alimony orders
 
00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:36.720 align:start position:0%
may be retroactive to the date the other
 
00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:38.560 align:start position:0%
party received notice of the
 
00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:40.240 align:start position:0%
modification petition
 
00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
this just is a technical issue that
 
00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:44.480 align:start position:0%
clarifies and makes
 
00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:47.200 align:start position:0%
this law consistent with other similar
 
00:12:48.629 --> 00:12:48.639 align:start position:0%
support laws
 
00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
that it a modification can be made but
 
00:12:53.509 --> 00:12:53.519 align:start position:0%
only back to the date that the
 
00:12:55.509 --> 00:12:55.519 align:start position:0%
modification was
 
00:12:57.269 --> 00:12:57.279 align:start position:0%
requested and the other party was
 
00:12:59.590 --> 00:12:59.600 align:start position:0%
notified in that
 
00:13:02.389 --> 00:13:02.399 align:start position:0%
um this bill also makes very clear that
 
00:13:02.399 --> 00:13:03.509 align:start position:0%
um this bill also makes very clear that
the

00:13:03.509 --> 00:13:03.519 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
original alimony statute for the 2001
 
00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:07.680 align:start position:0%
that went into effect on january 1st
 
00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:09.910 align:start position:0%
that went into effect on january 1st
2019

00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
2019
 
00:13:14.389 --> 00:13:14.399 align:start position:0%
applies only to divorces filed in 2019
 
00:13:17.509 --> 00:13:17.519 align:start position:0%
and not to prior cases
 
00:13:21.269 --> 00:13:21.279 align:start position:0%
uh or modifications that were filed
 
00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:25.200 align:start position:0%
before january 1st 2019 and it
 
00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:27.680 align:start position:0%
adds a provision on retroactivity on any
 
00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:28.629 align:start position:0%
adds a provision on retroactivity on any
alimony

00:13:28.629 --> 00:13:28.639 align:start position:0%
alimony
 
00:13:32.829 --> 00:13:32.839 align:start position:0%
modification that mirrors
 
00:13:34.949 --> 00:13:34.959 align:start position:0%
uh child support
 
00:13:38.069 --> 00:13:38.079 align:start position:0%
law about modification so that
 
00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:41.440 align:start position:0%
it kind of outlines generally
 
00:13:43.829 --> 00:13:43.839 align:start position:0%
what each of the provisions in this bill
 
00:13:43.839 --> 00:13:44.710 align:start position:0%
what each of the provisions in this bill
provides

00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:44.720 align:start position:0%
provides
 
00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
and um i i i'd be
 
00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions uh if if
 
00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:53.600 align:start position:0%
anyone has any but thank you for letting

basically bring um our current alimony
 
00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:11.590 align:start position:0%
basically bring um our current alimony
statute

00:14:11.590 --> 00:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:14:14.389 --> 00:14:14.399 align:start position:0%
um in compliance with federal tax laws
 
00:14:14.399 --> 00:14:15.189 align:start position:0%
um in compliance with federal tax laws
correct

00:14:15.189 --> 00:14:15.199 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
correct that is exactly it yes
 
00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:28.069 --> 00:14:28.079 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair um
 
00:14:31.509 --> 00:14:31.519 align:start position:0%
so miss mahoney uh would this
 
00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:34.720 align:start position:0%
apply for any would this scenario still
 
00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
apply for any
 
00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
further tax law change that would um
 
00:14:42.949 --> 00:14:42.959 align:start position:0%
that would uh have the payer
 
00:14:45.829 --> 00:14:45.839 align:start position:0%
paying more because of the tax liability
 
00:14:45.839 --> 00:14:47.269 align:start position:0%
paying more because of the tax liability
um

00:14:47.269 --> 00:14:47.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
do you understand the question not
 
00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:50.320 align:start position:0%
really i'm sorry
 
00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
yeah so i'm wondering if if the tax law
 
00:14:53.829 --> 00:14:53.839 align:start position:0%
changes again
 
00:14:57.430 --> 00:14:57.440 align:start position:0%
would we have to modify this statute
 
00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
or or does this
 
00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
sort of carry over to whatever whatever
 
00:15:06.949 --> 00:15:06.959 align:start position:0%
um whatever the tax law changes are
 
00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
well it would depend on what the change
 
00:15:10.069 --> 00:15:10.079 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:15:12.949 --> 00:15:12.959 align:start position:0%
but uh the inclusion of the language
 
00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
that i mentioned
 
00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:15.440 align:start position:0%
that the court can take into
 
00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:17.189 align:start position:0%
that the court can take into
consideration

00:15:17.189 --> 00:15:17.199 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
any um tax implications
 
00:15:24.829 --> 00:15:24.839 align:start position:0%
um i think provides some
 
00:15:27.509 --> 00:15:27.519 align:start position:0%
flexibility given the passage of timing
 
00:15:29.509 --> 00:15:29.519 align:start position:0%
so if there were some dramatic change
 
00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
let's say a return to the
 
00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:35.120 align:start position:0%
deductibility of alimony to the payor
 
00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:38.160 align:start position:0%
um there would have we'd have to return
 
00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
to change that percentage again
 
00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:42.320 align:start position:0%
precisely for the same reasons why we're
 
00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:49.749 --> 00:15:49.759 align:start position:0%
the the
 
00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
in the meantime because of the amount of
 
00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:53.120 align:start position:0%
time it takes to
 
00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:56.800 align:start position:0%
amend a bill or to ch amend a statute
 
00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:00.240 align:start position:0%
the court would have the the ability
 
00:16:03.749 --> 00:16:03.759 align:start position:0%
to take that into consideration
 
00:16:07.269 --> 00:16:07.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:09.749 --> 00:16:09.759 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions for miss
 
00:16:09.759 --> 00:16:12.949 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions for miss
mahoney

00:16:12.949 --> 00:16:12.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
i need i see no further hands okay
 
00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:18.000 align:start position:0%

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.030 align:start position:0%

that signed up in testimony
 
00:16:29.829 --> 00:16:29.839 align:start position:0%
is did anybody want to testify in the
 
00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:30.560 align:start position:0%
audience that
 
00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:33.440 align:start position:0%

00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:24.160 align:start position:0%

00:17:45.909 --> 00:17:45.919 align:start position:0%

committees at this time
 
00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:54.480 align:start position:0%
and she again thanks to you for your
 
00:29:56.549 --> 00:29:56.559 align:start position:0%
indulgence this bill grew out of a
 
00:29:58.149 --> 00:29:58.159 align:start position:0%
legislative study committee that was
 
00:30:00.630 --> 00:30:00.640 align:start position:0%
convened in 2019 it's also the
 
00:30:02.230 --> 00:30:02.240 align:start position:0%
recommendation of the new hampshire
 
00:30:04.389 --> 00:30:04.399 align:start position:0%
model court project and it would bring
 
00:30:07.669 --> 00:30:07.679 align:start position:0%
some clarity to the permanence process
 
00:30:09.909 --> 00:30:09.919 align:start position:0%
under the child protection act
 
00:30:11.909 --> 00:30:11.919 align:start position:0%
specifically the bill clarifies that
 
00:30:11.919 --> 00:30:13.029 align:start position:0%
specifically the bill clarifies that
adoption

00:30:13.029 --> 00:30:13.039 align:start position:0%
adoption
 
00:30:14.789 --> 00:30:14.799 align:start position:0%
rather than the termination of parental
 
00:30:17.590 --> 00:30:17.600 align:start position:0%
rights is a potential permanency plan
 
00:30:20.389 --> 00:30:20.399 align:start position:0%
objective clarifies the timing of the
 
00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:22.240 align:start position:0%
12-month permanency hearing
 
00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:24.480 align:start position:0%
and specifies other circumstances for
 
00:30:26.389 --> 00:30:26.399 align:start position:0%
which a subsequent perm
 
00:30:29.269 --> 00:30:29.279 align:start position:0%
permanency hearing may be conducted in
 
00:30:30.870 --> 00:30:30.880 align:start position:0%
some cases it allows for an
 
00:30:32.870 --> 00:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
earlier permanency hearing if the
 
00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:34.640 align:start position:0%
parents are in compliance
 
00:30:36.630 --> 00:30:36.640 align:start position:0%
and the unique needs of the child to
 
00:30:38.389 --> 00:30:38.399 align:start position:0%
present circumstances
 
00:30:41.269 --> 00:30:41.279 align:start position:0%
that justify it and it also gives the
 
00:30:41.279 --> 00:30:41.830 align:start position:0%
that justify it and it also gives the
court

00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:41.840 align:start position:0%
court
 
00:30:44.230 --> 00:30:44.240 align:start position:0%
the ability to modify a permanency plan
 
00:30:45.269 --> 00:30:45.279 align:start position:0%
by agreement
 
00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:48.240 align:start position:0%
at a post permanency hearing this would
 
00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:48.870 align:start position:0%
at a post permanency hearing this would
bring

00:30:48.870 --> 00:30:48.880 align:start position:0%
bring
 
00:30:51.510 --> 00:30:51.520 align:start position:0%
clarity and permanence to the adoption
 
00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:52.310 align:start position:0%
clarity and permanence to the adoption
process

00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:52.320 align:start position:0%

in support of senate bill 93
 
00:32:57.990 --> 00:32:58.000 align:start position:0%
um as introduced this was um
 
00:32:59.909 --> 00:32:59.919 align:start position:0%
arose out of recommendations from a
 
00:33:01.669 --> 00:33:01.679 align:start position:0%
study committee and was a collaborative
 
00:33:03.509 --> 00:33:03.519 align:start position:0%
effort with the model court
 
00:33:05.830 --> 00:33:05.840 align:start position:0%
and representatives of all disciplines
 
00:33:06.870 --> 00:33:06.880 align:start position:0%
that are engaged
 
00:33:10.870 --> 00:33:10.880 align:start position:0%
in child protection hearings um
 
00:33:13.830 --> 00:33:13.840 align:start position:0%
judge ashley's written testimony does a
 
00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
phenomenal job of
 
00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
summarizing the different parts of the
 
00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:19.440 align:start position:0%
bill and i'm not going to
 
00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
walk through each of the parts although
 
00:33:23.110 --> 00:33:23.120 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to take questions
 
00:33:26.950 --> 00:33:26.960 align:start position:0%
on on any of them if members have them
 
00:33:29.430 --> 00:33:29.440 align:start position:0%
um we are in support of this bill
 
00:33:30.389 --> 00:33:30.399 align:start position:0%
because we believe
 
00:33:32.630 --> 00:33:32.640 align:start position:0%
it better meets the needs of children
 
00:33:34.630 --> 00:33:34.640 align:start position:0%
and family who are involved in the child
 
00:33:36.389 --> 00:33:36.399 align:start position:0%
protection system
 
00:33:40.310 --> 00:33:40.320 align:start position:0%
it provides um clarity in the process
 
00:33:43.029 --> 00:33:43.039 align:start position:0%
both at the beginning phase and at the
 
00:33:44.310 --> 00:33:44.320 align:start position:0%
end of the permanency
 
00:33:46.870 --> 00:33:46.880 align:start position:0%
process and explains what to do when the
 
00:33:48.389 --> 00:33:48.399 align:start position:0%
unique needs of the
 
00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
child and family don't fit within the
 
00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:51.990 align:start position:0%
child and family don't fit within the
cookie

00:33:51.990 --> 00:33:52.000 align:start position:0%
cookie
 
00:33:54.710 --> 00:33:54.720 align:start position:0%
cutter 12-month permanency hearing
 
00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:56.789 align:start position:0%
cutter 12-month permanency hearing
process

00:33:56.789 --> 00:33:56.799 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:34:00.310 --> 00:34:00.320 align:start position:0%
if the bill is about
 
00:34:03.029 --> 00:34:03.039 align:start position:0%
meeting their needs early if efforts are
 
00:34:03.990 --> 00:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
not being made
 
00:34:06.710 --> 00:34:06.720 align:start position:0%
that the child can move on through
 
00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:07.909 align:start position:0%
that the child can move on through
permanency

00:34:07.909 --> 00:34:07.919 align:start position:0%
permanency
 
00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
and ultimately adoption um if
 
00:34:14.629 --> 00:34:14.639 align:start position:0%
if that is what is appropriate and gives
 
00:34:15.349 --> 00:34:15.359 align:start position:0%
the court
 
00:34:17.909 --> 00:34:17.919 align:start position:0%

00:34:21.030 --> 00:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
will occur and what the burden is for
 
00:34:22.069 --> 00:34:22.079 align:start position:0%
those hearings
 
00:34:25.510 --> 00:34:25.520 align:start position:0%
that was one of the driving factors in
 
00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
the study committee last year looking at
 
00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:28.560 align:start position:0%
whether or not
 
00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:30.720 align:start position:0%
the 12-month permanency hearing was
 
00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:31.589 align:start position:0%
the 12-month permanency hearing was
appropriate

00:34:31.589 --> 00:34:31.599 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
00:34:34.550 --> 00:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
so we addressed the the committee's
 
00:34:36.230 --> 00:34:36.240 align:start position:0%
needs with providing for
 
00:34:38.470 --> 00:34:38.480 align:start position:0%
a limited exception for early permanency
 
00:34:40.550 --> 00:34:40.560 align:start position:0%
hearings as well as
 
00:34:44.389 --> 00:34:44.399 align:start position:0%
providing detail on the process for the
 
00:34:45.270 --> 00:34:45.280 align:start position:0%
other end
 
00:34:49.109 --> 00:34:49.119 align:start position:0%
when we get to the 12-month mark and
 
00:34:51.909 --> 00:34:51.919 align:start position:0%
whether it's that the folks are almost
 
00:34:51.919 --> 00:34:52.389 align:start position:0%
whether it's that the folks are almost
there

00:34:52.389 --> 00:34:52.399 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:34:54.629 --> 00:34:54.639 align:start position:0%
and reunification looks like a
 
00:34:55.909 --> 00:34:55.919 align:start position:0%
reasonable outcome
 
00:34:59.349 --> 00:34:59.359 align:start position:0%
or whether um it's because of the unique
 
00:35:00.790 --> 00:35:00.800 align:start position:0%
needs of the child
 
00:35:03.510 --> 00:35:03.520 align:start position:0%
that permanent or reunification has not
 
00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
been achieved yet the court will now
 
00:35:05.829 --> 00:35:05.839 align:start position:0%
have direction
 
00:35:09.430 --> 00:35:09.440 align:start position:0%
on providing um one limited extension
 
00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
for a permanency hearing in order to
 
00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:13.829 align:start position:0%
for a permanency hearing in order to
allow

00:35:13.829 --> 00:35:13.839 align:start position:0%
allow
 
00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
the court and dcyf to meet the
 
00:35:20.069 --> 00:35:20.079 align:start position:0%
the best interest of the child um
 
00:35:23.349 --> 00:35:23.359 align:start position:0%
this is particularly good timing to make
 
00:35:25.910 --> 00:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
these changes and revamp this permanency
 
00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
process because it corresponds with all
 
00:35:28.310 --> 00:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
of the other
 
00:35:29.829 --> 00:35:29.839 align:start position:0%
changes that the legislature has
 
00:35:32.390 --> 00:35:32.400 align:start position:0%
supported to the to the service delivery
 
00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:32.870 align:start position:0%
supported to the to the service delivery
system

00:35:32.870 --> 00:35:32.880 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:35:36.550 --> 00:35:36.560 align:start position:0%
including um more preventative services
 
00:35:38.069 --> 00:35:38.079 align:start position:0%
through community-based voluntary
 
00:35:38.079 --> 00:35:39.030 align:start position:0%
through community-based voluntary
services

00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:39.040 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:35:41.510 --> 00:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
as well as the system of care changes
 
00:35:43.109 --> 00:35:43.119 align:start position:0%
for children's behavioral health which
 
00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:44.640 align:start position:0%
will be able to step in
 
00:35:46.150 --> 00:35:46.160 align:start position:0%
for those cases where it's the unique
 
00:35:47.510 --> 00:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
needs of the child preventing
 
00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:48.550 align:start position:0%
needs of the child preventing
reunification

00:35:48.550 --> 00:35:48.560 align:start position:0%
reunification
 
00:35:51.430 --> 00:35:51.440 align:start position:0%
at the the far end of that 12-month
 
00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:52.069 align:start position:0%
at the the far end of that 12-month
process

00:35:52.069 --> 00:35:52.079 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:55.200 align:start position:0%
so we believe that all of the changes in
 
00:35:56.630 --> 00:35:56.640 align:start position:0%
this bill are appropriate
 
00:36:00.550 --> 00:36:00.560 align:start position:0%
will provide clarity and consistency
 
00:36:03.829 --> 00:36:03.839 align:start position:0%
through our courts and to our families
 
00:36:07.510 --> 00:36:07.520 align:start position:0%
and um is consistent with
 
00:36:09.910 --> 00:36:09.920 align:start position:0%
the the service delivery changes that
 
00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
are being made and will be very helpful
 
00:36:13.829 --> 00:36:13.839 align:start position:0%
in supporting families accessing those
 
00:36:15.910 --> 00:36:15.920 align:start position:0%
services and meeting the best interests
 
00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:16.640 align:start position:0%
of children
 
00:36:18.390 --> 00:36:18.400 align:start position:0%

my name is marsha sink and i am the ceo
 
00:37:44.710 --> 00:37:44.720 align:start position:0%
of casa of new hampshire
 
00:37:46.150 --> 00:37:46.160 align:start position:0%
and i've been with casa since its
 
00:37:48.390 --> 00:37:48.400 align:start position:0%
inception in 1989.
 
00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:51.280 align:start position:0%
casa is statutorily mandated to serve as
 
00:37:52.390 --> 00:37:52.400 align:start position:0%
guardian ad litem
 
00:37:55.430 --> 00:37:55.440 align:start position:0%
on cases of child abuse and neglect in
 
00:37:57.630 --> 00:37:57.640 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 2020
 
00:38:01.910 --> 00:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
630 casa volunteer guardian zed litem

advocated for 1450 of our state's abused

and neglected children
 
00:38:10.870 --> 00:38:10.880 align:start position:0%
casa fully supports senate bill 93
 
00:38:13.910 --> 00:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
judge ashley's written testimony
 
00:38:16.310 --> 00:38:16.320 align:start position:0%
explains quite well the proposed changes
 
00:38:17.510 --> 00:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
to the statute
 
00:38:19.349 --> 00:38:19.359 align:start position:0%
which will better support children and
 
00:38:22.230 --> 00:38:22.240 align:start position:0%
families as it continues to encourage
 
00:38:24.870 --> 00:38:24.880 align:start position:0%
timely permanency for children and youth
 
00:38:27.430 --> 00:38:27.440 align:start position:0%
whose best interest is paramount
 
00:38:30.069 --> 00:38:30.079 align:start position:0%
casa supports the bill and it's entirely
 
00:38:32.069 --> 00:38:32.079 align:start position:0%
but i'd like to focus on the impact
 
00:38:34.310 --> 00:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
of extensions and delays and how this
 
00:38:35.589 --> 00:38:35.599 align:start position:0%
bill addresses
 
00:38:39.030 --> 00:38:39.040 align:start position:0%
the necessity to allow at times and
 
00:38:43.109 --> 00:38:43.119 align:start position:0%
with limits uh those extensions and
 
00:38:45.670 --> 00:38:45.680 align:start position:0%
all too often we see significant delays
 
00:38:46.950 --> 00:38:46.960 align:start position:0%
in permanency
 
00:38:48.630 --> 00:38:48.640 align:start position:0%
for children and the damage and
 
00:38:51.589 --> 00:38:51.599 align:start position:0%
additional trauma our system can inflict
 
00:38:53.670 --> 00:38:53.680 align:start position:0%
on these already traumatized children
 
00:38:56.470 --> 00:38:56.480 align:start position:0%
and youth as they wait for closure
 
00:38:59.030 --> 00:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
even when children and youth are in
 
00:39:01.190 --> 00:39:01.200 align:start position:0%
their pre-adoptive homes
 
00:39:03.510 --> 00:39:03.520 align:start position:0%
we have seen disrupted placements as
 
00:39:05.270 --> 00:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
these victims wait for months
 
00:39:08.150 --> 00:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
or years for the court and the parties
 
00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:08.710 align:start position:0%
or years for the court and the parties
to

00:39:08.710 --> 00:39:08.720 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
come to final decisions about their
 
00:39:12.950 --> 00:39:12.960 align:start position:0%
lives waiting to be adopted
 
00:39:16.310 --> 00:39:16.320 align:start position:0%
or waiting to go home last june i had
 
00:39:18.310 --> 00:39:18.320 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to virtually
 
00:39:21.790 --> 00:39:21.800 align:start position:0%
attend a nashua area celebration of
 
00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:23.349 align:start position:0%
attend a nashua area celebration of
reunification

00:39:23.349 --> 00:39:23.359 align:start position:0%
reunification
 
00:39:25.829 --> 00:39:25.839 align:start position:0%
it was attended by dcauif workers
 
00:39:28.470 --> 00:39:28.480 align:start position:0%
supervisors casa volunteers and others
 
00:39:30.230 --> 00:39:30.240 align:start position:0%
but most importantly it was attended by
 
00:39:31.510 --> 00:39:31.520 align:start position:0%
families that had been
 
00:39:35.430 --> 00:39:35.440 align:start position:0%
successfully reunified i'll never forget
 
00:39:37.270 --> 00:39:37.280 align:start position:0%
i mean this has just stuck with me one
 
00:39:38.550 --> 00:39:38.560 align:start position:0%
mom on this zoom
 
00:39:40.630 --> 00:39:40.640 align:start position:0%
call with her two children sort of
 
00:39:42.310 --> 00:39:42.320 align:start position:0%
hanging over her shoulders
 
00:39:43.990 --> 00:39:44.000 align:start position:0%
who were laughing and smiling so they
 
00:39:47.430 --> 00:39:47.440 align:start position:0%
could get their faces into the screen
 
00:39:50.950 --> 00:39:50.960 align:start position:0%
to be seen and this mom called out judge
 
00:39:53.910 --> 00:39:53.920 align:start position:0%
leary who took the time to be with them
 
00:39:55.589 --> 00:39:55.599 align:start position:0%
that evening
 
00:39:57.589 --> 00:39:57.599 align:start position:0%
and she said to judge leary if you had
 
00:39:58.630 --> 00:39:58.640 align:start position:0%
not given me
 
00:40:01.270 --> 00:40:01.280 align:start position:0%
more time i would not be sitting here
 
00:40:04.309 --> 00:40:04.319 align:start position:0%
right now with my children home with me
 
00:40:06.550 --> 00:40:06.560 align:start position:0%
and this was an example of how one mom
 
00:40:08.710 --> 00:40:08.720 align:start position:0%
working hard in recovery
 
00:40:10.870 --> 00:40:10.880 align:start position:0%
was given the additional time and
 
00:40:13.030 --> 00:40:13.040 align:start position:0%
enabled the opportunity for her children
 
00:40:15.190 --> 00:40:15.200 align:start position:0%
to come home
 
00:40:16.870 --> 00:40:16.880 align:start position:0%
we believe that it's in the best
 
00:40:18.870 --> 00:40:18.880 align:start position:0%
interest of our casa kids as we call
 
00:40:20.230 --> 00:40:20.240 align:start position:0%
them to be entitled
 
00:40:22.230 --> 00:40:22.240 align:start position:0%
to the reassurance that this bill will
 
00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:24.720 align:start position:0%
provide for timely permanency
 
00:40:27.510 --> 00:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
one little nine-year-old boy whose case
 
00:40:29.510 --> 00:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
had been open for several years
 
00:40:32.069 --> 00:40:32.079 align:start position:0%
said to his casabob you better hurry up
 
00:40:33.829 --> 00:40:33.839 align:start position:0%
and get me adopted because i'm not going
 
00:40:36.870 --> 00:40:36.880 align:start position:0%
to be cute much longer
 
00:40:39.829 --> 00:40:39.839 align:start position:0%
when reunification is not the plan then
 
00:40:41.670 --> 00:40:41.680 align:start position:0%
seemingly endless days
 
00:40:43.990 --> 00:40:44.000 align:start position:0%
to children waiting can cause
 
00:40:46.230 --> 00:40:46.240 align:start position:0%
irreparable and permanent harm
 
00:40:48.309 --> 00:40:48.319 align:start position:0%
timely permanency is critical to the
 
00:40:50.230 --> 00:40:50.240 align:start position:0%
well-being of children and their
 
00:40:52.870 --> 00:40:52.880 align:start position:0%
families and senate bill 93 will provide
 
00:40:55.349 --> 00:40:55.359 align:start position:0%
clarification in the statute and

um so just to reiterate some very
 
00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:22.790 align:start position:0%
um so just to reiterate some very
important

00:42:22.790 --> 00:42:22.800 align:start position:0%
important
 
00:42:26.069 --> 00:42:26.079 align:start position:0%
um points that she made
 
00:42:29.109 --> 00:42:29.119 align:start position:0%
senate bill 93 does an incredible job at
 
00:42:32.790 --> 00:42:32.800 align:start position:0%
clarifying compelling reasons
 
00:42:37.670 --> 00:42:37.680 align:start position:0%
as to why early permanency or extensions
 
00:42:41.670 --> 00:42:41.680 align:start position:0%
can be important in permanency hearings
 
00:42:43.910 --> 00:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
a study conducted in 2018 found that
 
00:42:45.589 --> 00:42:45.599 align:start position:0%
over 37
 
00:42:48.150 --> 00:42:48.160 align:start position:0%
000 youths are emancipated from the from
 
00:42:49.750 --> 00:42:49.760 align:start position:0%
the foster care system
 
00:42:52.630 --> 00:42:52.640 align:start position:0%
without any kind of permanency plan the
 
00:42:55.349 --> 00:42:55.359 align:start position:0%
study also talked about the impacts that
 
00:42:57.349 --> 00:42:57.359 align:start position:0%
this has on the mental health of
 
00:43:00.790 --> 00:43:00.800 align:start position:0%
children and youth in our system
 
00:43:04.470 --> 00:43:04.480 align:start position:0%
as they wait you know
 
00:43:06.790 --> 00:43:06.800 align:start position:0%
an endless amount of time whether that's
 
00:43:08.150 --> 00:43:08.160 align:start position:0%
months or a year
 
00:43:11.430 --> 00:43:11.440 align:start position:0%
or even the 12 months even that's
 
00:43:13.349 --> 00:43:13.359 align:start position:0%
12 months that children are in our
 
00:43:15.190 --> 00:43:15.200 align:start position:0%
system wondering
 
00:43:17.829 --> 00:43:17.839 align:start position:0%
what their future looks like and a lot
 
00:43:19.670 --> 00:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
of these children
 
00:43:22.790 --> 00:43:22.800 align:start position:0%
feel hopeless at times especially as
 
00:43:24.309 --> 00:43:24.319 align:start position:0%
they begin to age
 
00:43:27.109 --> 00:43:27.119 align:start position:0%
um because unfortunately there is this
 
00:43:28.870 --> 00:43:28.880 align:start position:0%
thought and a stigma around the fact
 
00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:29.510 align:start position:0%
thought and a stigma around the fact
that

00:43:29.510 --> 00:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:43:33.190 --> 00:43:33.200 align:start position:0%
older youth are unadoptable
 
00:43:35.910 --> 00:43:35.920 align:start position:0%
in these cases i think early permanency
 
00:43:37.910 --> 00:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
hearings can make a great difference in
 
00:43:39.109 --> 00:43:39.119 align:start position:0%
the mental health
 
00:43:40.470 --> 00:43:40.480 align:start position:0%
of our children and youth in the state
 
00:43:41.910 --> 00:43:41.920 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire and i urge you to take
 
00:43:43.670 --> 00:43:43.680 align:start position:0%
that into consideration
 
00:43:47.190 --> 00:43:47.200 align:start position:0%
um no one wants to be taken out of an
 
00:43:49.750 --> 00:43:49.760 align:start position:0%
abuse or neglect situation just to feel
 
00:43:51.670 --> 00:43:51.680 align:start position:0%
neglected by the system that's
 
00:43:54.790 --> 00:43:54.800 align:start position:0%
there to support them um so
 
00:43:56.470 --> 00:43:56.480 align:start position:0%
i thank you for your time today i don't
 
00:43:57.829 --> 00:43:57.839 align:start position:0%

hampshire's child advocate

and i'm happy to speak in support of
 
00:44:48.230 --> 00:44:48.240 align:start position:0%
senate bill 93
 
00:44:50.069 --> 00:44:50.079 align:start position:0%
relative to permanency planning under
 
00:44:51.910 --> 00:44:51.920 align:start position:0%
the child protection act
 
00:44:54.470 --> 00:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
we do absolutely support the bill i
 
00:44:56.550 --> 00:44:56.560 align:start position:0%
don't think i can add
 
00:44:58.790 --> 00:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
to the eloquence of mahdi singh from
 
00:45:00.630 --> 00:45:00.640 align:start position:0%
casa new hampshire and what this means
 
00:45:03.190 --> 00:45:03.200 align:start position:0%
in terms of the concept of permanency
 
00:45:05.109 --> 00:45:05.119 align:start position:0%
i will point out that one of my staff
 
00:45:07.190 --> 00:45:07.200 align:start position:0%
noticed last summer
 
00:45:08.870 --> 00:45:08.880 align:start position:0%
in the midst of all the angst around
 
00:45:10.630 --> 00:45:10.640 align:start position:0%
covert 19
 
00:45:13.510 --> 00:45:13.520 align:start position:0%
that our experience of the pandemic and
 
00:45:14.309 --> 00:45:14.319 align:start position:0%
the lockdown
 
00:45:16.069 --> 00:45:16.079 align:start position:0%
was very much like the experience of a
 
00:45:18.390 --> 00:45:18.400 align:start position:0%
child awaiting permanency
 
00:45:20.950 --> 00:45:20.960 align:start position:0%
we now know all about the impact of
 
00:45:22.870 --> 00:45:22.880 align:start position:0%
being separated from loved ones and not
 
00:45:24.069 --> 00:45:24.079 align:start position:0%
knowing what's going to happen
 
00:45:26.470 --> 00:45:26.480 align:start position:0%
next and so i hope that we use that
 
00:45:28.309 --> 00:45:28.319 align:start position:0%
shared experience to inform decisions
 
00:45:29.990 --> 00:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
going forward
 
00:45:33.109 --> 00:45:33.119 align:start position:0%
as i said we do support the bill um and
 
00:45:34.470 --> 00:45:34.480 align:start position:0%
its intent for smooth
 
00:45:36.790 --> 00:45:36.800 align:start position:0%
uh transitions when natural parents are
 
00:45:39.190 --> 00:45:39.200 align:start position:0%
unable or unwilling to be parents
 
00:45:42.230 --> 00:45:42.240 align:start position:0%
um we do however want to take advantage
 
00:45:44.150 --> 00:45:44.160 align:start position:0%
of your time if you'll be so generous to
 
00:45:44.790 --> 00:45:44.800 align:start position:0%
just make
 
00:45:46.950 --> 00:45:46.960 align:start position:0%
one comment on something that we're we
 
00:45:49.190 --> 00:45:49.200 align:start position:0%
we have a concern and we want to share
 
00:45:51.109 --> 00:45:51.119 align:start position:0%
should this bill pass and become part of
 
00:45:53.589 --> 00:45:53.599 align:start position:0%
the legal fabric of families lives
 
00:45:55.270 --> 00:45:55.280 align:start position:0%
we want to urge the division for
 
00:45:56.790 --> 00:45:56.800 align:start position:0%

lives of children who are removed from
 
00:46:06.230 --> 00:46:06.240 align:start position:0%
their parents to be mindful
 
00:46:08.630 --> 00:46:08.640 align:start position:0%
of the extent of loss involved when
 
00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:09.990 align:start position:0%

permanency
 
00:46:15.510 --> 00:46:15.520 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be exclusive of important
 
00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:17.430 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be exclusive of important
relationships

00:46:17.430 --> 00:46:17.440 align:start position:0%

in the office of the child advocate
 
00:46:20.630 --> 00:46:20.640 align:start position:0%
we've observed children who had
 
00:46:22.550 --> 00:46:22.560 align:start position:0%
meaningful relationships with parents
 
00:46:23.349 --> 00:46:23.359 align:start position:0%
who were just
 
00:46:26.150 --> 00:46:26.160 align:start position:0%
unable to parent the office of the child
 
00:46:27.910 --> 00:46:27.920 align:start position:0%

children's cases including the case of
 
00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:33.750 align:start position:0%
children's cases including the case of
joseph

00:46:33.750 --> 00:46:33.760 align:start position:0%
joseph
 
00:46:35.910 --> 00:46:35.920 align:start position:0%
joseph lost a deep relationship with his
 
00:46:37.990 --> 00:46:38.000 align:start position:0%
mother who visited him regularly
 
00:46:40.390 --> 00:46:40.400 align:start position:0%
and whom he never saw again after her
 
00:46:42.069 --> 00:46:42.079 align:start position:0%
rights were terminated
 
00:46:43.750 --> 00:46:43.760 align:start position:0%
he later lost a relationship with a
 
00:46:45.829 --> 00:46:45.839 align:start position:0%
foster mother and then his aunt and
 
00:46:48.390 --> 00:46:48.400 align:start position:0%
uncle well we don't disagree that those
 
00:46:49.910 --> 00:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
four people may not have been able to
 
00:46:52.230 --> 00:46:52.240 align:start position:0%
meet his needs as permanent caregivers
 
00:46:54.790 --> 00:46:54.800 align:start position:0%
they did and still do mean something to
 
00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:55.670 align:start position:0%
they did and still do mean something to
him

00:46:55.670 --> 00:46:55.680 align:start position:0%
him
 
00:46:57.190 --> 00:46:57.200 align:start position:0%
he's left with trying to understand
 
00:46:59.109 --> 00:46:59.119 align:start position:0%
whether they failed him or he failed
 
00:46:59.119 --> 00:47:00.150 align:start position:0%
whether they failed him or he failed
them

00:47:00.150 --> 00:47:00.160 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:47:02.710 --> 00:47:02.720 align:start position:0%
so these relationships in whatever form
 
00:47:04.069 --> 00:47:04.079 align:start position:0%
they might end up being
 
00:47:06.230 --> 00:47:06.240 align:start position:0%
are integral to a child's self-worth and
 
00:47:08.230 --> 00:47:08.240 align:start position:0%
ability to bond with others
 
00:47:09.990 --> 00:47:10.000 align:start position:0%
one of the most common calls that we
 
00:47:11.109 --> 00:47:11.119 align:start position:0%
receive at the office of the child
 
00:47:12.870 --> 00:47:12.880 align:start position:0%
advocate is from a grandparent
 
00:47:15.510 --> 00:47:15.520 align:start position:0%
aunt or uncle who just want to be a part
 
00:47:17.270 --> 00:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
of a child's life
 
00:47:19.190 --> 00:47:19.200 align:start position:0%
often they have strong bonded
 
00:47:21.190 --> 00:47:21.200 align:start position:0%
relationships with the child
 
00:47:23.190 --> 00:47:23.200 align:start position:0%
some are fighting to be parents when
 
00:47:24.710 --> 00:47:24.720 align:start position:0%
actually they would be best
 
00:47:27.030 --> 00:47:27.040 align:start position:0%
suited to remain the child's grandparent
 
00:47:28.470 --> 00:47:28.480 align:start position:0%
or aunt or uncle
 
00:47:30.630 --> 00:47:30.640 align:start position:0%
unfortunately those opportunities are
 
00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:31.990 align:start position:0%
unfortunately those opportunities are
rare

00:47:31.990 --> 00:47:32.000 align:start position:0%
rare
 
00:47:33.750 --> 00:47:33.760 align:start position:0%
so we understand that you cannot
 
00:47:33.760 --> 00:47:35.030 align:start position:0%
so we understand that you cannot
legislate

00:47:35.030 --> 00:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
legislate
 
00:47:37.270 --> 00:47:37.280 align:start position:0%
or force relationships amongst families
 
00:47:38.069 --> 00:47:38.079 align:start position:0%
and foster
 
00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:40.400 align:start position:0%
adoptive families however we would be
 
00:47:42.390 --> 00:47:42.400 align:start position:0%
remiss if we didn't take this request
 
00:47:45.109 --> 00:47:45.119 align:start position:0%
and put it on record that as we take a
 
00:47:46.390 --> 00:47:46.400 align:start position:0%
close look at the law
 
00:47:48.309 --> 00:47:48.319 align:start position:0%
to be sure children are able to rest in
 
00:47:48.319 --> 00:47:49.430 align:start position:0%
to be sure children are able to rest in
permanency

00:47:49.430 --> 00:47:49.440 align:start position:0%
permanency
 
00:47:51.270 --> 00:47:51.280 align:start position:0%
that the people who influence children's
 
00:47:53.030 --> 00:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
relationships do whatever they can to
 
00:47:53.040 --> 00:47:53.750 align:start position:0%
relationships do whatever they can to
promote

00:47:53.750 --> 00:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
promote
 
00:47:56.069 --> 00:47:56.079 align:start position:0%
and support the salvaging of relative
 
00:47:58.790 --> 00:47:58.800 align:start position:0%
relative relationships in whatever form
 
00:48:00.950 --> 00:48:00.960 align:start position:0%
in the best interest of children so the
 
00:48:02.470 --> 00:48:02.480 align:start position:0%
office of child advocate urges the
 
00:48:05.190 --> 00:48:05.200 align:start position:0%
committee to pass senate bill 93
 
00:48:06.950 --> 00:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
and we also asked consideration from
 
00:48:09.190 --> 00:48:09.200 align:start position:0%
those involved to be sure
 
00:48:11.109 --> 00:48:11.119 align:start position:0%
the importance of family relationships
 
00:48:13.030 --> 00:48:13.040 align:start position:0%
for children in all decisions rendered
 
00:48:14.549 --> 00:48:14.559 align:start position:0%
on their behalf so thank you very much
 
00:48:16.390 --> 00:48:16.400 align:start position:0%
for giving me that time to
 
00:48:18.950 --> 00:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
just say that i'm happy to take
 
00:48:20.790 --> 00:48:20.800 align:start position:0%
questions if you have them
 
00:48:23.430 --> 00:48:23.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very much miss o'neill i i
 
00:48:25.109 --> 00:48:25.119 align:start position:0%
have to agree with your points
 
00:48:28.069 --> 00:48:28.079 align:start position:0%
thank you for bringing those up um any
 
00:48:29.030 --> 00:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
questions for
 
00:48:31.670 --> 00:48:31.680 align:start position:0%
uh miss o'neal representative lewicki
 
00:48:33.190 --> 00:48:33.200 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you ms
 
00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:34.470 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you ms
o'neill

00:48:34.470 --> 00:48:34.480 align:start position:0%
o'neill
 
00:48:35.589 --> 00:48:35.599 align:start position:0%
one of the things i'm not really
 
00:48:37.109 --> 00:48:37.119 align:start position:0%
familiar with the process and if you
 
00:48:38.790 --> 00:48:38.800 align:start position:0%
could give a brief overview of how the
 
00:48:40.470 --> 00:48:40.480 align:start position:0%
schedule works and so forth
 
00:48:42.150 --> 00:48:42.160 align:start position:0%
it might be very helpful to me and
 
00:48:44.950 --> 00:48:44.960 align:start position:0%
possibly other members of the committee
 
00:48:46.549 --> 00:48:46.559 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for that question i
 
00:48:48.309 --> 00:48:48.319 align:start position:0%
really regret that judge ashley wasn't
 
00:48:49.670 --> 00:48:49.680 align:start position:0%
available today
 
00:48:51.829 --> 00:48:51.839 align:start position:0%
and i would refer you to her testimony
 
00:48:53.589 --> 00:48:53.599 align:start position:0%
as she understands the
 
00:48:55.670 --> 00:48:55.680 align:start position:0%
details of it and can explain it so much
 
00:48:55.680 --> 00:48:56.710 align:start position:0%
details of it and can explain it so much
better

00:48:56.710 --> 00:48:56.720 align:start position:0%
better
 
00:48:59.750 --> 00:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
in general there's when a child comes
 
00:49:00.630 --> 00:49:00.640 align:start position:0%
into care there's
 
00:49:02.790 --> 00:49:02.800 align:start position:0%
there's an expectation for permanency
 
00:49:04.950 --> 00:49:04.960 align:start position:0%
within 12 months
 
00:49:07.109 --> 00:49:07.119 align:start position:0%
and so what this law does is give some
 
00:49:07.119 --> 00:49:08.069 align:start position:0%
and so what this law does is give some
flexibility

00:49:08.069 --> 00:49:08.079 align:start position:0%
flexibility
 
00:49:10.309 --> 00:49:10.319 align:start position:0%
sometimes for that 12 months to be
 
00:49:10.319 --> 00:49:11.270 align:start position:0%
sometimes for that 12 months to be
shorter

00:49:11.270 --> 00:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
shorter
 
00:49:14.390 --> 00:49:14.400 align:start position:0%
and sometimes for that to be longer
 
00:49:17.190 --> 00:49:17.200 align:start position:0%
the the 12 months is based on sort of
 
00:49:19.270 --> 00:49:19.280 align:start position:0%
the idea around the developmental needs
 
00:49:20.710 --> 00:49:20.720 align:start position:0%
of a child the bonding
 
00:49:23.430 --> 00:49:23.440 align:start position:0%
relationships necessary for children um
 
00:49:25.190 --> 00:49:25.200 align:start position:0%
and the idea that permanency is so
 
00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:26.150 align:start position:0%
and the idea that permanency is so
important

00:49:26.150 --> 00:49:26.160 align:start position:0%
important
 
00:49:28.790 --> 00:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it doesn't always align
 
00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:29.349 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it doesn't always align
with

00:49:29.349 --> 00:49:29.359 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:49:32.390 --> 00:49:32.400 align:start position:0%
treatment um schedules so the
 
00:49:35.589 --> 00:49:35.599 align:start position:0%
the the availability of someone to be
 
00:49:36.630 --> 00:49:36.640 align:start position:0%
ready for
 
00:49:39.030 --> 00:49:39.040 align:start position:0%
say for example substance use treatment
 
00:49:41.430 --> 00:49:41.440 align:start position:0%
um to be willing and able and to access
 
00:49:41.440 --> 00:49:42.150 align:start position:0%
um to be willing and able and to access
services

00:49:42.150 --> 00:49:42.160 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:49:44.069 --> 00:49:44.079 align:start position:0%
sometimes don't align with that and may
 
00:49:45.589 --> 00:49:45.599 align:start position:0%
take longer
 
00:49:48.069 --> 00:49:48.079 align:start position:0%
there are also times when um it's very
 
00:49:48.790 --> 00:49:48.800 align:start position:0%
clear that
 
00:49:51.910 --> 00:49:51.920 align:start position:0%
a child's not going to be able to be
 
00:49:54.630 --> 00:49:54.640 align:start position:0%
reunited with a with parents because of
 
00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:55.750 align:start position:0%
reunited with a with parents because of
incarceration

00:49:55.750 --> 00:49:55.760 align:start position:0%
incarceration
 
00:49:59.910 --> 00:49:59.920 align:start position:0%
or severe illness or or other factors
 
00:50:01.829 --> 00:50:01.839 align:start position:0%
and in that case that child may be
 
00:50:04.390 --> 00:50:04.400 align:start position:0%
waiting for a long period of time
 
00:50:06.549 --> 00:50:06.559 align:start position:0%
for that decision to make because of the
 
00:50:09.030 --> 00:50:09.040 align:start position:0%
expectation around the 12 months
 
00:50:10.390 --> 00:50:10.400 align:start position:0%
so this just gives a little bit of
 
00:50:12.630 --> 00:50:12.640 align:start position:0%
flexibility in the courts so that
 
00:50:15.030 --> 00:50:15.040 align:start position:0%
um all of those persons who are working
 
00:50:16.230 --> 00:50:16.240 align:start position:0%
in the best interest of the child will
 
00:50:17.430 --> 00:50:17.440 align:start position:0%
be able to
 
00:50:19.430 --> 00:50:19.440 align:start position:0%
make that child feel as though they
 
00:50:20.630 --> 00:50:20.640 align:start position:0%
they're at home
 
00:50:26.790 --> 00:50:26.800 align:start position:0%
and um and they have some permanency
 
00:50:28.950 --> 00:50:28.960 align:start position:0%
thank you great thank you very much are
 
00:50:30.309 --> 00:50:30.319 align:start position:0%

00:50:30.319 --> 00:50:32.150 align:start position:0%

community service and this is also
 
01:17:11.430 --> 01:17:11.440 align:start position:0%
to be seen as an extension of our
 
01:17:13.750 --> 01:17:13.760 align:start position:0%
current system of care
 
01:17:16.630 --> 01:17:16.640 align:start position:0%
and so really what we'd want to do is
 
01:17:17.590 --> 01:17:17.600 align:start position:0%
try to get
 
01:17:20.149 --> 01:17:20.159 align:start position:0%

01:17:27.510 --> 01:17:27.520 align:start position:0%

good morning madam chair michael skibby

i do not have written testimony and i'll
 
01:18:25.189 --> 01:18:25.199 align:start position:0%
just testify briefly
 
01:18:28.550 --> 01:18:28.560 align:start position:0%
this is a bill that um um i think
 
01:18:30.470 --> 01:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
um well let me let me just stop for a
 
01:18:31.830 --> 01:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
moment and and thank
 
01:18:34.870 --> 01:18:34.880 align:start position:0%
um senator carson uh for her sponsorship
 
01:18:36.470 --> 01:18:36.480 align:start position:0%
of this bill
 
01:18:41.030 --> 01:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
um and um i think uh thanks also go to
 
01:18:44.149 --> 01:18:44.159 align:start position:0%
uh mr ribson and his staff and
 
01:18:47.030 --> 01:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
the the other members of his of his
 
01:18:49.270 --> 01:18:49.280 align:start position:0%
working group for reaching out to me
 
01:18:50.709 --> 01:18:50.719 align:start position:0%
and to other members of the juvenile
 
01:18:53.830 --> 01:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
reform project such as waypoint and
 
01:18:55.189 --> 01:18:55.199 align:start position:0%
the aclu and new hampshire legal
 
01:18:56.950 --> 01:18:56.960 align:start position:0%
assistance a group that i think you're
 
01:18:58.870 --> 01:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
all familiar with on our juvenile reform
 
01:18:58.880 --> 01:19:00.550 align:start position:0%
all familiar with on our juvenile reform
efforts

01:19:00.550 --> 01:19:00.560 align:start position:0%
efforts
 
01:19:03.590 --> 01:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
they um engaged with us in i think a
 
01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:04.149 align:start position:0%
they um engaged with us in i think a
very

01:19:04.149 --> 01:19:04.159 align:start position:0%
very
 
01:19:06.630 --> 01:19:06.640 align:start position:0%
constructive and productive way and i
 
01:19:07.990 --> 01:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
think that the result was
 
01:19:11.350 --> 01:19:11.360 align:start position:0%
a bill that is deserving of your support
 
01:19:12.709 --> 01:19:12.719 align:start position:0%
it's certainly
 
01:19:15.669 --> 01:19:15.679 align:start position:0%
something that i support um i think that
 
01:19:15.679 --> 01:19:15.990 align:start position:0%
something that i support um i think that
that

01:19:15.990 --> 01:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:19:18.950 --> 01:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
one of the challenges of of um of
 
01:19:20.870 --> 01:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
juvenile justice
 
01:19:23.590 --> 01:19:23.600 align:start position:0%
is sort of a paradox that um as the
 
01:19:24.470 --> 01:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
system reform
 
01:19:27.830 --> 01:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
as the system responds to um misconduct
 
01:19:29.110 --> 01:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
on the part of youth
 
01:19:32.870 --> 01:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
um it it oftentimes um
 
01:19:35.830 --> 01:19:35.840 align:start position:0%
makes things worse not better um through
 
01:19:37.270 --> 01:19:37.280 align:start position:0%
no bad intention but
 
01:19:39.830 --> 01:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
the the fact of the matter is is that
 
01:19:40.950 --> 01:19:40.960 align:start position:0%
the more deeply
 
01:19:42.950 --> 01:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
um a child gets pulled into the juvenile
 
01:19:44.470 --> 01:19:44.480 align:start position:0%
delinquency system
 
01:19:48.229 --> 01:19:48.239 align:start position:0%
um the more uh often um the recidivism
 
01:19:50.950 --> 01:19:50.960 align:start position:0%
rate goes up not down
 
01:19:55.110 --> 01:19:55.120 align:start position:0%
and you know oftentimes that is most
 
01:19:56.950 --> 01:19:56.960 align:start position:0%
apparent when you're talking about very
 
01:19:58.550 --> 01:19:58.560 align:start position:0%
minor offenses
 
01:20:01.910 --> 01:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
the more formal the and um
 
01:20:04.149 --> 01:20:04.159 align:start position:0%
and firm if you will the response on the
 
01:20:05.669 --> 01:20:05.679 align:start position:0%
part of law enforcement on the part of
 
01:20:07.110 --> 01:20:07.120 align:start position:0%
courts on the part of
 
01:20:10.310 --> 01:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
uh the other elements of the system uh
 
01:20:12.550 --> 01:20:12.560 align:start position:0%
the more likely it is that the child
 
01:20:13.350 --> 01:20:13.360 align:start position:0%
will um
 
01:20:15.669 --> 01:20:15.679 align:start position:0%
will return again and again um
 
01:20:16.950 --> 01:20:16.960 align:start position:0%
oftentimes that's because of
 
01:20:16.960 --> 01:20:18.310 align:start position:0%
oftentimes that's because of
self-labeling

01:20:18.310 --> 01:20:18.320 align:start position:0%
self-labeling
 
01:20:20.870 --> 01:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
oftentimes it's because of stigma in
 
01:20:22.310 --> 01:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
their community
 
01:20:24.149 --> 01:20:24.159 align:start position:0%
oftentimes it's because of the weakening
 
01:20:25.590 --> 01:20:25.600 align:start position:0%
of protective
 
01:20:28.470 --> 01:20:28.480 align:start position:0%
connections that are extremely important
 
01:20:28.480 --> 01:20:28.870 align:start position:0%
connections that are extremely important
for

01:20:28.870 --> 01:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:20:30.830 --> 01:20:30.840 align:start position:0%
children who are at risk of future
 
01:20:30.840 --> 01:20:32.070 align:start position:0%
children who are at risk of future
delinquency

01:20:32.070 --> 01:20:32.080 align:start position:0%
delinquency
 
01:20:34.550 --> 01:20:34.560 align:start position:0%
and so it's very important if possible
 
01:20:35.990 --> 01:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
and if it can be done safely
 
01:20:38.070 --> 01:20:38.080 align:start position:0%
to have as therapeutic response as
 
01:20:38.080 --> 01:20:39.030 align:start position:0%
to have as therapeutic response as
possible

01:20:39.030 --> 01:20:39.040 align:start position:0%
possible
 
01:20:41.270 --> 01:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
and to have that response be outside the
 
01:20:42.629 --> 01:20:42.639 align:start position:0%
court and
 
01:20:44.149 --> 01:20:44.159 align:start position:0%
the other elements of the formal justice
 
01:20:45.990 --> 01:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
system and i think senate bill 94 does
 
01:20:48.870 --> 01:20:48.880 align:start position:0%
that and it and it effectively balances
 
01:20:51.430 --> 01:20:51.440 align:start position:0%
the needs of the formal system
 
01:20:54.550 --> 01:20:54.560 align:start position:0%
uh with the treatment needs of of the
 
01:20:55.910 --> 01:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
system and what it's really trying to
 
01:20:57.590 --> 01:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
accomplish in terms of therapeutic
 
01:20:57.600 --> 01:20:58.629 align:start position:0%
accomplish in terms of therapeutic
responses

01:20:58.629 --> 01:20:58.639 align:start position:0%
responses
 
01:21:02.149 --> 01:21:02.159 align:start position:0%
um i won't go into detail into sort of
 
01:21:03.189 --> 01:21:03.199 align:start position:0%
describing the
 
01:21:05.669 --> 01:21:05.679 align:start position:0%
the bill i'm sure that mr ribson or one
 
01:21:07.110 --> 01:21:07.120 align:start position:0%
of one of his colleagues will do that
 
01:21:07.990 --> 01:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
for you but
 
01:21:10.070 --> 01:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
i think that one of the concerns that we
 
01:21:11.910 --> 01:21:11.920 align:start position:0%
had was to make sure that
 
01:21:15.510 --> 01:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
if early in a child's
 
01:21:18.149 --> 01:21:18.159 align:start position:0%
encounter with uh with law enforcement
 
01:21:18.629 --> 01:21:18.639 align:start position:0%
and with
 
01:21:20.390 --> 01:21:20.400 align:start position:0%
the juvenile justice system they're
 
01:21:21.669 --> 01:21:21.679 align:start position:0%
being asked questions about their
 
01:21:23.189 --> 01:21:23.199 align:start position:0%
treatment needs there are certain risks
 
01:21:24.629 --> 01:21:24.639 align:start position:0%
that come with that
 
01:21:27.189 --> 01:21:27.199 align:start position:0%
that can be important for the fairness
 
01:21:29.270 --> 01:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
of the adjudicatory system that is
 
01:21:30.629 --> 01:21:30.639 align:start position:0%
you know is a child going to be asked
 
01:21:32.310 --> 01:21:32.320 align:start position:0%
questions that could later
 
01:21:35.990 --> 01:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
be used to um against them in court
 
01:21:38.390 --> 01:21:38.400 align:start position:0%
and and that's a very difficult and
 
01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:39.510 align:start position:0%
and and that's a very difficult and
challenging

01:21:39.510 --> 01:21:39.520 align:start position:0%
challenging
 
01:21:42.870 --> 01:21:42.880 align:start position:0%
um issue to deal with in a way that both
 
01:21:46.310 --> 01:21:46.320 align:start position:0%
gets the information to frame services
 
01:21:48.950 --> 01:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
um in an accurate and effective way but
 
01:21:50.550 --> 01:21:50.560 align:start position:0%
also protects the child's rights
 
01:21:52.629 --> 01:21:52.639 align:start position:0%
if in fact the formal system proceeds
 
01:21:54.070 --> 01:21:54.080 align:start position:0%
and i think that this bill does that
 
01:21:55.669 --> 01:21:55.679 align:start position:0%
very effectively
 
01:21:57.750 --> 01:21:57.760 align:start position:0%
and again i want to thank mr ripson and
 
01:21:59.270 --> 01:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
his colleagues for
 
01:22:01.510 --> 01:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
being willing to engage on that issue
 
01:22:02.629 --> 01:22:02.639 align:start position:0%
and other issues that
 
01:22:04.790 --> 01:22:04.800 align:start position:0%
were of concern to us i'd be happy to
 
01:22:07.350 --> 01:22:07.360 align:start position:0%
answer any questions thank you
 
01:22:09.189 --> 01:22:09.199 align:start position:0%
great thank you very much representative
 
01:22:09.199 --> 01:22:11.750 align:start position:0%
great thank you very much representative
long

01:22:11.750 --> 01:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
long
 
01:22:14.950 --> 01:22:14.960 align:start position:0%
thank you uh thank you madam chair uh
 
01:22:16.709 --> 01:22:16.719 align:start position:0%
mr skippy do you have the bill in front
 
01:22:19.110 --> 01:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
of you by any chance i do
 
01:22:22.629 --> 01:22:22.639 align:start position:0%
um i i'm not sure if you'd be the one
 
01:22:23.510 --> 01:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
answered or maybe
 
01:22:26.950 --> 01:22:26.960 align:start position:0%
mr ripson but uh when you look on page
 
01:22:26.960 --> 01:22:27.669 align:start position:0%
mr ripson but uh when you look on page
uh

01:22:27.669 --> 01:22:27.679 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:22:31.669 --> 01:22:31.679 align:start position:0%
when you look on page 2 line 15
 
01:22:34.709 --> 01:22:34.719 align:start position:0%
yes the the department shall obtain the
 
01:22:36.229 --> 01:22:36.239 align:start position:0%
consent of the minor
 
01:22:39.350 --> 01:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
and the miner's parent and guardian then
 
01:22:40.149 --> 01:22:40.159 align:start position:0%
when you look at
 
01:22:43.110 --> 01:22:43.120 align:start position:0%
b and there's two other places in this
 
01:22:45.270 --> 01:22:45.280 align:start position:0%
bill where it says if the miner
 
01:22:49.189 --> 01:22:49.199 align:start position:0%
or the miner's parent does not consent
 
01:22:53.669 --> 01:22:53.679 align:start position:0%
do you see a possible misunderstanding
 
01:22:56.870 --> 01:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
where it first starts off saying
 
01:23:00.229 --> 01:23:00.239 align:start position:0%
both need to consent and then it's
 
01:23:05.510 --> 01:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
um it leaves it up to one or the other
 
01:23:07.270 --> 01:23:07.280 align:start position:0%
do i see that as a as a practical
 
01:23:09.189 --> 01:23:09.199 align:start position:0%
problem is that the question
 
01:23:12.550 --> 01:23:12.560 align:start position:0%
yes um well i can certainly imagine
 
01:23:14.229 --> 01:23:14.239 align:start position:0%
circumstances where
 
01:23:17.510 --> 01:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
um that could be challenging
 
01:23:21.030 --> 01:23:21.040 align:start position:0%
um and and i suppose you know i think
 
01:23:24.229 --> 01:23:24.239 align:start position:0%
we would all have to live with um the
 
01:23:24.239 --> 01:23:24.790 align:start position:0%
we would all have to live with um the
one

01:23:24.790 --> 01:23:24.800 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:23:27.270 --> 01:23:27.280 align:start position:0%
the one possibility which is that the
 
01:23:27.280 --> 01:23:28.790 align:start position:0%
the one possibility which is that the
minor

01:23:28.790 --> 01:23:28.800 align:start position:0%
minor
 
01:23:30.950 --> 01:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
um wants to go one way and the parents
 
01:23:32.870 --> 01:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
want to go the other and the
 
01:23:34.629 --> 01:23:34.639 align:start position:0%
the parent have to remain in the
 
01:23:36.550 --> 01:23:36.560 align:start position:0%
driver's seat in within with regard
 
01:23:37.830 --> 01:23:37.840 align:start position:0%
let's say that the minor
 
01:23:41.189 --> 01:23:41.199 align:start position:0%
objects and the parents want to proceed
 
01:23:42.870 --> 01:23:42.880 align:start position:0%
or let me put it the other way the minor
 
01:23:44.229 --> 01:23:44.239 align:start position:0%
the minor
 
01:23:46.550 --> 01:23:46.560 align:start position:0%
um doesn't want to proceed with the but
 
01:23:48.310 --> 01:23:48.320 align:start position:0%
the parents want to proceed
 
01:23:51.110 --> 01:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
i think that that's pretty problematic
 
01:23:51.120 --> 01:23:52.070 align:start position:0%
i think that that's pretty problematic
um

01:23:52.070 --> 01:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:54.950 --> 01:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
well let me just let me start over i
 
01:23:56.550 --> 01:23:56.560 align:start position:0%
think that one of the problems that we
 
01:23:57.750 --> 01:23:57.760 align:start position:0%
have is that
 
01:24:00.870 --> 01:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
for this for this process to work um you
 
01:24:02.629 --> 01:24:02.639 align:start position:0%
have to live with
 
01:24:05.830 --> 01:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
the sort of tradition and the legal um
 
01:24:09.270 --> 01:24:09.280 align:start position:0%
framework that we have that minors um
 
01:24:11.270 --> 01:24:11.280 align:start position:0%
are really subject to the wishes of
 
01:24:12.870 --> 01:24:12.880 align:start position:0%
their parents or guardian and so you
 
01:24:12.880 --> 01:24:13.669 align:start position:0%
their parents or guardian and so you
can't

01:24:13.669 --> 01:24:13.679 align:start position:0%
can't
 
01:24:17.350 --> 01:24:17.360 align:start position:0%
subject a minor to involuntary medical
 
01:24:19.110 --> 01:24:19.120 align:start position:0%
treatment without the consent of
 
01:24:20.950 --> 01:24:20.960 align:start position:0%
of the parent or guardian or an
 
01:24:22.229 --> 01:24:22.239 align:start position:0%
assessment without the consent of the
 
01:24:23.750 --> 01:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
parent regard and i just think i don't
 
01:24:25.189 --> 01:24:25.199 align:start position:0%
think there's any way around that
 
01:24:28.229 --> 01:24:28.239 align:start position:0%
unless you're part of some sort of
 
01:24:29.830 --> 01:24:29.840 align:start position:0%
legal proceeding so i think that's
 
01:24:31.270 --> 01:24:31.280 align:start position:0%
really the problem
 
01:24:34.870 --> 01:24:34.880 align:start position:0%
um but it would be unfortunate if
 
01:24:38.149 --> 01:24:38.159 align:start position:0%
um if the parents
 
01:24:40.550 --> 01:24:40.560 align:start position:0%
are wanting well i can i can imagine
 
01:24:41.830 --> 01:24:41.840 align:start position:0%
circumstances where
 
01:24:42.790 --> 01:24:42.800 align:start position:0%
where there would be a lot of
 
01:24:44.550 --> 01:24:44.560 align:start position:0%
frustration about you know the parents
 
01:24:46.149 --> 01:24:46.159 align:start position:0%
wanting to proceed the system wanting to
 
01:24:46.159 --> 01:24:46.790 align:start position:0%
wanting to proceed the system wanting to
proceed

01:24:46.790 --> 01:24:46.800 align:start position:0%
proceed
 
01:24:48.390 --> 01:24:48.400 align:start position:0%
and because the minor's objections it's
 
01:24:51.270 --> 01:24:51.280 align:start position:0%
not going to go forward
 
01:24:55.030 --> 01:24:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:56.830 --> 01:24:56.840 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions for mr
 
01:24:56.840 --> 01:25:00.149 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions for mr
skivy

01:25:00.149 --> 01:25:00.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:02.149 --> 01:25:02.159 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
01:25:02.159 --> 01:25:03.669 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
you

01:25:03.669 --> 01:25:03.679 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:25:05.750 --> 01:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
i'm going to go a little out of order
 
01:25:08.229 --> 01:25:08.239 align:start position:0%
right now so that we can um
 
01:25:12.070 --> 01:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
hear from um joe ribson the director
 
01:25:15.510 --> 01:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
of dcyf because i think he he um
 
01:25:18.709 --> 01:25:18.719 align:start position:0%
or mrs ross may be able to answer um
 
01:25:23.669 --> 01:25:23.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:27.189 --> 01:25:27.199 align:start position:0%
great thank you uh madam chair
 
01:25:31.030 --> 01:25:31.040 align:start position:0%

i am in my office in concord alone um
 
01:25:39.350 --> 01:25:39.360 align:start position:0%
just a bit of warning they're doing work
 
01:25:40.629 --> 01:25:40.639 align:start position:0%
on our fire
 
01:25:42.390 --> 01:25:42.400 align:start position:0%
alarm system today so hopefully that
 
01:25:43.910 --> 01:25:43.920 align:start position:0%
won't happen in the middle of
 
01:25:47.430 --> 01:25:47.440 align:start position:0%
my testimony but it could um
 
01:25:49.270 --> 01:25:49.280 align:start position:0%
and thank you senator carson and thank
 
01:25:50.870 --> 01:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
you representative belanger for bringing
 
01:25:52.470 --> 01:25:52.480 align:start position:0%
this forward for us this is really
 
01:25:55.910 --> 01:25:55.920 align:start position:0%
important work i'm very very grateful to
 
01:25:57.430 --> 01:25:57.440 align:start position:0%
the host of stakeholders who have been
 
01:25:59.110 --> 01:25:59.120 align:start position:0%
involved in this process and very very
 
01:26:00.870 --> 01:26:00.880 align:start position:0%
grateful to the host of stakeholders
 
01:26:02.229 --> 01:26:02.239 align:start position:0%
who are going to continue to be involved
 
01:26:04.310 --> 01:26:04.320 align:start position:0%
in this process this is just one part of
 
01:26:04.320 --> 01:26:05.189 align:start position:0%
in this process this is just one part of
a

01:26:05.189 --> 01:26:05.199 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:26:07.990 --> 01:26:08.000 align:start position:0%
of a of a very ambitious project to
 
01:26:08.950 --> 01:26:08.960 align:start position:0%
really kind of
 
01:26:10.550 --> 01:26:10.560 align:start position:0%
redefine the way the juvenile justice
 
01:26:12.070 --> 01:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
works in this state and we're trying to
 
01:26:13.750 --> 01:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
do it by including
 
01:26:16.229 --> 01:26:16.239 align:start position:0%
um all the voices that have a stake in
 
01:26:18.390 --> 01:26:18.400 align:start position:0%
this you know parents and family voice
 
01:26:21.669 --> 01:26:21.679 align:start position:0%
youth voice all of the professional
 
01:26:21.679 --> 01:26:22.870 align:start position:0%
youth voice all of the professional
stakeholders

01:26:22.870 --> 01:26:22.880 align:start position:0%
stakeholders
 
01:26:25.030 --> 01:26:25.040 align:start position:0%
um and that's not always easy sometimes
 
01:26:27.030 --> 01:26:27.040 align:start position:0%
folks have disagreements about some of
 
01:26:27.910 --> 01:26:27.920 align:start position:0%
these things and we
 
01:26:29.750 --> 01:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
we try to wrestle with them but we're
 
01:26:31.350 --> 01:26:31.360 align:start position:0%
trying to take all concerns seriously
 
01:26:33.030 --> 01:26:33.040 align:start position:0%
and move forward in a way that
 
01:26:36.550 --> 01:26:36.560 align:start position:0%
that makes sense for everybody so
 
01:26:38.790 --> 01:26:38.800 align:start position:0%
as uh representative cars or as senator
 
01:26:40.790 --> 01:26:40.800 align:start position:0%
carson shared this bill was
 
01:26:43.189 --> 01:26:43.199 align:start position:0%
um crafted by the what we're calling the
 
01:26:44.790 --> 01:26:44.800 align:start position:0%
juvenile justice transformation group
 
01:26:45.669 --> 01:26:45.679 align:start position:0%
which was a
 
01:26:48.310 --> 01:26:48.320 align:start position:0%
group of folks who in november of 2019
 
01:26:51.270 --> 01:26:51.280 align:start position:0%
were awarded a grant to join a project
 
01:26:53.590 --> 01:26:53.600 align:start position:0%
down at georgetown university with the
 
01:26:56.709 --> 01:26:56.719 align:start position:0%
support of the annie e casey foundation
 
01:26:58.310 --> 01:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of really thinking about
 
01:26:59.910 --> 01:26:59.920 align:start position:0%
juvenile probation and what works and
 
01:27:01.350 --> 01:27:01.360 align:start position:0%
what doesn't work
 
01:27:04.550 --> 01:27:04.560 align:start position:0%
and for the purpose of you know really
 
01:27:05.750 --> 01:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
trying to make sure that
 
01:27:07.350 --> 01:27:07.360 align:start position:0%
kids who end up in that system are the
 
01:27:08.790 --> 01:27:08.800 align:start position:0%
kids who need that system and that there
 
01:27:10.470 --> 01:27:10.480 align:start position:0%
are lots of kids who don't need that
 
01:27:12.070 --> 01:27:12.080 align:start position:0%
depth of intervention who could be
 
01:27:13.270 --> 01:27:13.280 align:start position:0%
served in a
 
01:27:16.629 --> 01:27:16.639 align:start position:0%
in a more voluntary um more voluntary
 
01:27:18.390 --> 01:27:18.400 align:start position:0%
fashion without having to get deeply
 
01:27:20.310 --> 01:27:20.320 align:start position:0%
into that system it's smart for kids
 
01:27:21.910 --> 01:27:21.920 align:start position:0%
i think it makes it makes kids have
 
01:27:24.070 --> 01:27:24.080 align:start position:0%
better outcomes but it's also smart from
 
01:27:26.229 --> 01:27:26.239 align:start position:0%
a resource perspective where you
 
01:27:28.070 --> 01:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
uh currently have a lot of kids going
 
01:27:29.270 --> 01:27:29.280 align:start position:0%
through the formal system who probably
 
01:27:30.470 --> 01:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
didn't need to be there
 
01:27:32.070 --> 01:27:32.080 align:start position:0%
and that takes up attorney time it takes
 
01:27:34.310 --> 01:27:34.320 align:start position:0%
up precious bench time which is a
 
01:27:36.149 --> 01:27:36.159 align:start position:0%
commodity that's that's hard to find
 
01:27:37.430 --> 01:27:37.440 align:start position:0%
across um
 
01:27:40.070 --> 01:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
our state and it takes up time of
 
01:27:41.910 --> 01:27:41.920 align:start position:0%
juvenile probation staff
 
01:27:43.830 --> 01:27:43.840 align:start position:0%
and you know what this bill seeks to do
 
01:27:45.030 --> 01:27:45.040 align:start position:0%
is to kind of shift
 
01:27:46.149 --> 01:27:46.159 align:start position:0%
part of the role of our juvenile
 
01:27:48.149 --> 01:27:48.159 align:start position:0%
probation staff to make them more
 
01:27:50.709 --> 01:27:50.719 align:start position:0%
proactive and preventative in their work
 
01:27:52.310 --> 01:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
instead of having to only be reactive to
 
01:27:53.990 --> 01:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
court cases so now let me go into a
 
01:27:55.189 --> 01:27:55.199 align:start position:0%
little bit about what this bill
 
01:27:56.870 --> 01:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
actually you know how this is supposed
 
01:27:58.310 --> 01:27:58.320 align:start position:0%
to work
 
01:28:01.590 --> 01:28:01.600 align:start position:0%
um so what this does is it really
 
01:28:04.229 --> 01:28:04.239 align:start position:0%
quite simply creates a process by which
 
01:28:06.229 --> 01:28:06.239 align:start position:0%
whenever a child has contact with law
 
01:28:08.310 --> 01:28:08.320 align:start position:0%
enforcement be it an arrest or not
 
01:28:09.830 --> 01:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
they don't we don't want to force people
 
01:28:11.430 --> 01:28:11.440 align:start position:0%
to arrest kids but if they have contact
 
01:28:12.709 --> 01:28:12.719 align:start position:0%
with law enforcement
 
01:28:14.470 --> 01:28:14.480 align:start position:0%
law enforcement may refer to the
 
01:28:16.229 --> 01:28:16.239 align:start position:0%
department to have a strength and needs
 
01:28:18.470 --> 01:28:18.480 align:start position:0%
assessment conducted
 
01:28:20.229 --> 01:28:20.239 align:start position:0%
the family and the youth do have to
 
01:28:21.990 --> 01:28:22.000 align:start position:0%
consent to having that conducted this is
 
01:28:23.669 --> 01:28:23.679 align:start position:0%
not supposed to be a compulsory thing
 
01:28:25.350 --> 01:28:25.360 align:start position:0%
it's a way to try to voluntarily get
 
01:28:27.590 --> 01:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
kids out of the system
 
01:28:29.270 --> 01:28:29.280 align:start position:0%
we will then conduct that assessment and
 
01:28:30.629 --> 01:28:30.639 align:start position:0%
we'll make a recommendation as to
 
01:28:32.390 --> 01:28:32.400 align:start position:0%
whether there's community-based services
 
01:28:33.669 --> 01:28:33.679 align:start position:0%
that could help
 
01:28:35.189 --> 01:28:35.199 align:start position:0%
things like fast-forward perhaps if
 
01:28:37.350 --> 01:28:37.360 align:start position:0%
there's a behavioral health intervention
 
01:28:39.830 --> 01:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
that needs to be provided or even a
 
01:28:41.270 --> 01:28:41.280 align:start position:0%
voluntary case with
 
01:28:42.709 --> 01:28:42.719 align:start position:0%
juvenile justice there's what we call
 
01:28:44.390 --> 01:28:44.400 align:start position:0%
voluntary chins which don't have to go
 
01:28:45.750 --> 01:28:45.760 align:start position:0%
through the formal court process but
 
01:28:45.760 --> 01:28:47.189 align:start position:0%
through the formal court process but
allows

01:28:47.189 --> 01:28:47.199 align:start position:0%
allows
 
01:28:48.709 --> 01:28:48.719 align:start position:0%
families and youth to access all the
 
01:28:50.550 --> 01:28:50.560 align:start position:0%
services that dcyf can pay for and
 
01:28:51.590 --> 01:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
provide if they're clinically
 
01:28:51.600 --> 01:28:53.350 align:start position:0%
provide if they're clinically
appropriate

01:28:53.350 --> 01:28:53.360 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
01:28:55.830 --> 01:28:55.840 align:start position:0%
so the idea is to conduct that voluntary
 
01:28:57.189 --> 01:28:57.199 align:start position:0%
assessment and then at the end of that
 
01:28:58.470 --> 01:28:58.480 align:start position:0%
voluntary assessment
 
01:29:00.070 --> 01:29:00.080 align:start position:0%
we'll provide a recommendation back to
 
01:29:01.669 --> 01:29:01.679 align:start position:0%
the referring entity typically a law
 
01:29:03.590 --> 01:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
enforcement prosecution
 
01:29:06.470 --> 01:29:06.480 align:start position:0%
about you know what types of services
 
01:29:07.669 --> 01:29:07.679 align:start position:0%
we've recommended and whether we
 
01:29:07.679 --> 01:29:08.470 align:start position:0%
we've recommended and whether we
recommend

01:29:08.470 --> 01:29:08.480 align:start position:0%
recommend
 
01:29:10.550 --> 01:29:10.560 align:start position:0%
that a formal case needs to continue to
 
01:29:12.229 --> 01:29:12.239 align:start position:0%
be filed and move forward
 
01:29:13.750 --> 01:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
it's really important to note that
 
01:29:15.669 --> 01:29:15.679 align:start position:0%
that's not it's a recommendation
 
01:29:17.830 --> 01:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
it's not mandatory nobody you know no
 
01:29:19.669 --> 01:29:19.679 align:start position:0%
prosecutor is required
 
01:29:21.910 --> 01:29:21.920 align:start position:0%
to follow our recommendation but they
 
01:29:24.470 --> 01:29:24.480 align:start position:0%
will have our recommendation um and i do
 
01:29:26.229 --> 01:29:26.239 align:start position:0%
think that's an important part to
 
01:29:28.550 --> 01:29:28.560 align:start position:0%
ensure that they have some um some
 
01:29:30.149 --> 01:29:30.159 align:start position:0%
independence in their decision making as
 
01:29:30.159 --> 01:29:30.550 align:start position:0%
independence in their decision making as
well

01:29:30.550 --> 01:29:30.560 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:29:32.629 --> 01:29:32.639 align:start position:0%
so we're conducting an evaluation we're
 
01:29:34.229 --> 01:29:34.239 align:start position:0%
making a recommendation
 
01:29:35.750 --> 01:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
we think for many youth they're gonna
 
01:29:38.070 --> 01:29:38.080 align:start position:0%
voluntarily engage and be able to be
 
01:29:39.669 --> 01:29:39.679 align:start position:0%
diverted from the formal system
 
01:29:42.629 --> 01:29:42.639 align:start position:0%
but if they choose not to and if a
 
01:29:44.550 --> 01:29:44.560 align:start position:0%
prosecutor decides that for the purposes
 
01:29:45.830 --> 01:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
of community safety or whatever that
 
01:29:47.270 --> 01:29:47.280 align:start position:0%
they want to proceed they'll be able to
 
01:29:51.669 --> 01:29:51.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:53.750 --> 01:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
the other big piece of this is in
 
01:29:55.350 --> 01:29:55.360 align:start position:0%
addition to that assessment being able
 
01:29:57.030 --> 01:29:57.040 align:start position:0%
to be used at that front end
 
01:29:58.550 --> 01:29:58.560 align:start position:0%
to be able to determine whether there
 
01:30:00.149 --> 01:30:00.159 align:start position:0%
are services that can be provided before
 
01:30:01.430 --> 01:30:01.440 align:start position:0%
kids go to court
 
01:30:03.750 --> 01:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
it also is useful if kids actually do go
 
01:30:04.629 --> 01:30:04.639 align:start position:0%
to court
 
01:30:08.310 --> 01:30:08.320 align:start position:0%
so what happens today in many many cases
 
01:30:10.470 --> 01:30:10.480 align:start position:0%
is that kids end up going through court
 
01:30:11.990 --> 01:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
and the dispositions have been filed
 
01:30:13.590 --> 01:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
without anybody ever actually assessing
 
01:30:15.350 --> 01:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
what the kids needs were
 
01:30:16.709 --> 01:30:16.719 align:start position:0%
and you end up in a situation where
 
01:30:18.470 --> 01:30:18.480 align:start position:0%
largely attorneys
 
01:30:21.030 --> 01:30:21.040 align:start position:0%
are making what are clinical decisions
 
01:30:22.870 --> 01:30:22.880 align:start position:0%
you know whether that be judges or
 
01:30:26.149 --> 01:30:26.159 align:start position:0%
defense counsel or um prosecutors making
 
01:30:27.430 --> 01:30:27.440 align:start position:0%
clinical decisions about what kids
 
01:30:28.629 --> 01:30:28.639 align:start position:0%
really need without ever going through
 
01:30:29.430 --> 01:30:29.440 align:start position:0%
an assessment
 
01:30:30.550 --> 01:30:30.560 align:start position:0%
and that doesn't make a whole lot of
 
01:30:32.870 --> 01:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
sense to me um you really need the
 
01:30:34.790 --> 01:30:34.800 align:start position:0%
advice of the people who understand kids
 
01:30:36.870 --> 01:30:36.880 align:start position:0%
needs to be able to make those plans
 
01:30:38.310 --> 01:30:38.320 align:start position:0%
so the other big piece of this is that
 
01:30:39.990 --> 01:30:40.000 align:start position:0%
when that assessment occurs even if the
 
01:30:41.270 --> 01:30:41.280 align:start position:0%
kid ends up going through the court
 
01:30:41.280 --> 01:30:41.830 align:start position:0%
kid ends up going through the court
process

01:30:41.830 --> 01:30:41.840 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:30:43.990 --> 01:30:44.000 align:start position:0%
that that information could be used to
 
01:30:45.910 --> 01:30:45.920 align:start position:0%
develop better recommendations for youth
 
01:30:47.510 --> 01:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
who do need to go through the formal
 
01:30:47.520 --> 01:30:48.310 align:start position:0%
who do need to go through the formal
system

01:30:48.310 --> 01:30:48.320 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:30:49.510 --> 01:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the things that we're
 
01:30:51.030 --> 01:30:51.040 align:start position:0%
providing actually make sense for what
 
01:30:55.030 --> 01:30:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:57.189 --> 01:30:57.199 align:start position:0%
again i just want to you know speak a
 
01:30:58.870 --> 01:30:58.880 align:start position:0%
little bit to representative long's
 
01:31:00.550 --> 01:31:00.560 align:start position:0%
question around the
 
01:31:03.830 --> 01:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
um voluntary nature of the
 
01:31:07.990 --> 01:31:08.000 align:start position:0%
the assessment process it's voluntary
 
01:31:09.590 --> 01:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
it requires both the parent and the
 
01:31:11.189 --> 01:31:11.199 align:start position:0%
youth to consent largely for the reasons
 
01:31:13.910 --> 01:31:13.920 align:start position:0%
that mr skivy put forward
 
01:31:15.350 --> 01:31:15.360 align:start position:0%
i don't think the two sections are
 
01:31:16.950 --> 01:31:16.960 align:start position:0%
irreconcilable because
 
01:31:19.590 --> 01:31:19.600 align:start position:0%
it requires an a that both parties
 
01:31:21.669 --> 01:31:21.679 align:start position:0%
consent for us to conduct the assessment
 
01:31:23.350 --> 01:31:23.360 align:start position:0%
and then b it switches to the negative
 
01:31:25.270 --> 01:31:25.280 align:start position:0%
so if either party objects we cannot
 
01:31:26.790 --> 01:31:26.800 align:start position:0%
then share that assessment information
 
01:31:26.800 --> 01:31:27.910 align:start position:0%
then share that assessment information
further

01:31:27.910 --> 01:31:27.920 align:start position:0%
further
 
01:31:30.390 --> 01:31:30.400 align:start position:0%
um so i think i i do think that they're
 
01:31:32.070 --> 01:31:32.080 align:start position:0%
they can be read together to work as
 
01:31:33.270 --> 01:31:33.280 align:start position:0%
currently written
 
01:31:35.510 --> 01:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
um because we're requiring in the first
 
01:31:37.030 --> 01:31:37.040 align:start position:0%
instance both to consent to start and
 
01:31:38.870 --> 01:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
then the second instance both to consent
 
01:31:40.950 --> 01:31:40.960 align:start position:0%
to um to proceed with sharing that
 
01:31:40.960 --> 01:31:41.910 align:start position:0%
to um to proceed with sharing that
information

01:31:41.910 --> 01:31:41.920 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:31:43.910 --> 01:31:43.920 align:start position:0%
as mr skibby pointed out there were some
 
01:31:45.430 --> 01:31:45.440 align:start position:0%
additional protections put in place
 
01:31:47.030 --> 01:31:47.040 align:start position:0%
and you know it was never our intent to
 
01:31:48.629 --> 01:31:48.639 align:start position:0%
use this as a way to get information
 
01:31:49.590 --> 01:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
from youth to
 
01:31:51.830 --> 01:31:51.840 align:start position:0%
to be able to have that be used against
 
01:31:53.590 --> 01:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
them in an adjudicatory process it's
 
01:31:55.750 --> 01:31:55.760 align:start position:0%
really about identifying needs
 
01:31:57.910 --> 01:31:57.920 align:start position:0%
um so with the help of mr skibby and
 
01:31:59.270 --> 01:31:59.280 align:start position:0%
some of the other stakeholders were able
 
01:32:01.990 --> 01:32:02.000 align:start position:0%
to craft some language to make sure that
 
01:32:04.229 --> 01:32:04.239 align:start position:0%
you don't have to worry about anything
 
01:32:05.990 --> 01:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
that a youth discloses
 
01:32:07.510 --> 01:32:07.520 align:start position:0%
during that assessment process being
 
01:32:09.830 --> 01:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
used against them in a delinquency
 
01:32:11.990 --> 01:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
process through the courts
 
01:32:13.669 --> 01:32:13.679 align:start position:0%
so that information is only allowed to
 
01:32:15.030 --> 01:32:15.040 align:start position:0%
be used
 
01:32:17.110 --> 01:32:17.120 align:start position:0%
again with the consent of the youth and
 
01:32:18.070 --> 01:32:18.080 align:start position:0%
the family
 
01:32:20.310 --> 01:32:20.320 align:start position:0%
and again this is all really about
 
01:32:21.910 --> 01:32:21.920 align:start position:0%
identifying needs sooner
 
01:32:23.510 --> 01:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
getting kids what they need sooner
 
01:32:24.709 --> 01:32:24.719 align:start position:0%
keeping them from getting deeper into
 
01:32:25.990 --> 01:32:26.000 align:start position:0%
the system
 
01:32:28.070 --> 01:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
and with that i'm happy to take any
 
01:32:31.189 --> 01:32:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:33.189 --> 01:32:33.199 align:start position:0%
great thank you so i have a quick
 
01:32:35.910 --> 01:32:35.920 align:start position:0%
question uh
 
01:32:38.310 --> 01:32:38.320 align:start position:0%
27 people signed in in opposition to
 
01:32:40.229 --> 01:32:40.239 align:start position:0%
this and a lot of them seem to be
 
01:32:42.950 --> 01:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
from police departments so i'm curious
 
01:32:44.070 --> 01:32:44.080 align:start position:0%
as to
 
01:32:45.910 --> 01:32:45.920 align:start position:0%
if you would have because no one signed
 
01:32:47.830 --> 01:32:47.840 align:start position:0%
up to speak against it
 
01:32:50.950 --> 01:32:50.960 align:start position:0%
but what their issue would be
 
01:32:53.669 --> 01:32:53.679 align:start position:0%
with this yeah you know i don't want to
 
01:32:55.110 --> 01:32:55.120 align:start position:0%
i don't want to speculate too much i
 
01:32:55.669 --> 01:32:55.679 align:start position:0%
will say
 
01:32:58.790 --> 01:32:58.800 align:start position:0%
as part of this project we have been um
 
01:33:00.470 --> 01:33:00.480 align:start position:0%
holding a host of meetings i think i
 
01:33:01.990 --> 01:33:02.000 align:start position:0%
think representative wong was at some of
 
01:33:03.669 --> 01:33:03.679 align:start position:0%
them i think um a few other folks were
 
01:33:05.350 --> 01:33:05.360 align:start position:0%
at some of them as well
 
01:33:07.830 --> 01:33:07.840 align:start position:0%
um where we've walked through what were
 
01:33:09.030 --> 01:33:09.040 align:start position:0%
what the plan is
 
01:33:10.310 --> 01:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
with this work and then had what we
 
01:33:11.669 --> 01:33:11.679 align:start position:0%
called affinity groups where all the
 
01:33:13.030 --> 01:33:13.040 align:start position:0%
different stakeholders could come in
 
01:33:13.040 --> 01:33:13.990 align:start position:0%
different stakeholders could come in
groups

01:33:13.990 --> 01:33:14.000 align:start position:0%
groups
 
01:33:16.790 --> 01:33:16.800 align:start position:0%
like themselves and share their feedback
 
01:33:18.229 --> 01:33:18.239 align:start position:0%
and we did have some law enforcement
 
01:33:18.239 --> 01:33:19.030 align:start position:0%
and we did have some law enforcement
folks

01:33:19.030 --> 01:33:19.040 align:start position:0%
folks
 
01:33:20.550 --> 01:33:20.560 align:start position:0%
show up at the law enforcement affinity
 
01:33:22.629 --> 01:33:22.639 align:start position:0%
group who expressed some concerns
 
01:33:26.310 --> 01:33:26.320 align:start position:0%
um largely around i think frustration
 
01:33:27.510 --> 01:33:27.520 align:start position:0%
that a lot of the changes that have
 
01:33:28.870 --> 01:33:28.880 align:start position:0%
taken place in the juvenile justice
 
01:33:30.390 --> 01:33:30.400 align:start position:0%
system over the past decade have taken
 
01:33:32.390 --> 01:33:32.400 align:start position:0%
place without their voice at the table
 
01:33:33.669 --> 01:33:33.679 align:start position:0%
and there might be more specific
 
01:33:35.590 --> 01:33:35.600 align:start position:0%
concerns than that but that was a lot of
 
01:33:36.629 --> 01:33:36.639 align:start position:0%
what we heard
 
01:33:39.750 --> 01:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
and i think a lot of skepticism um
 
01:33:42.790 --> 01:33:42.800 align:start position:0%
that that this will actually work
 
01:33:44.070 --> 01:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
um because i think it's one of their
 
01:33:45.990 --> 01:33:46.000 align:start position:0%
experiences they've not seen
 
01:33:48.870 --> 01:33:48.880 align:start position:0%
diversion programs be as successful as
 
01:33:48.880 --> 01:33:49.270 align:start position:0%
diversion programs be as successful as
as

01:33:49.270 --> 01:33:49.280 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:33:51.189 --> 01:33:51.199 align:start position:0%
they'd like them to be and i think you
 
01:33:52.950 --> 01:33:52.960 align:start position:0%
know again i i don't want to set up a
 
01:33:54.550 --> 01:33:54.560 align:start position:0%
straw man they can certainly speak
 
01:33:55.990 --> 01:33:56.000 align:start position:0%
for themselves as to what their concerns
 
01:33:57.270 --> 01:33:57.280 align:start position:0%
were but that's those are the concerns
 
01:33:58.470 --> 01:33:58.480 align:start position:0%
that i heard
 
01:34:00.390 --> 01:34:00.400 align:start position:0%
um and in response to both of those
 
01:34:01.510 --> 01:34:01.520 align:start position:0%
things i think my
 
01:34:03.590 --> 01:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
my response would be one we want
 
01:34:04.790 --> 01:34:04.800 align:start position:0%
everybody at the table
 
01:34:06.149 --> 01:34:06.159 align:start position:0%
you know we've we've been trying to get
 
01:34:07.350 --> 01:34:07.360 align:start position:0%
rid of the table there are a host of
 
01:34:08.550 --> 01:34:08.560 align:start position:0%
sessions coming up about how to
 
01:34:10.229 --> 01:34:10.239 align:start position:0%
implement this work going forward that
 
01:34:10.239 --> 01:34:10.790 align:start position:0%
implement this work going forward that
certainly

01:34:10.790 --> 01:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
01:34:12.790 --> 01:34:12.800 align:start position:0%
anybody and everybody who's concerned
 
01:34:14.149 --> 01:34:14.159 align:start position:0%
can be part of that
 
01:34:15.510 --> 01:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
in order for us to make sure that this
 
01:34:18.149 --> 01:34:18.159 align:start position:0%
works and secondarily we're trying
 
01:34:19.189 --> 01:34:19.199 align:start position:0%
something new that's
 
01:34:21.030 --> 01:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
not the same as how these things work
 
01:34:22.229 --> 01:34:22.239 align:start position:0%
today in this state
 
01:34:24.790 --> 01:34:24.800 align:start position:0%
right so you can't really compare how
 
01:34:26.310 --> 01:34:26.320 align:start position:0%
the current system works to what we're
 
01:34:27.350 --> 01:34:27.360 align:start position:0%
talking about doing here
 
01:34:28.870 --> 01:34:28.880 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about doing here is
 
01:34:31.510 --> 01:34:31.520 align:start position:0%
is totally new and totally different
 
01:34:33.430 --> 01:34:33.440 align:start position:0%
and then lastly just to emphasize as i
 
01:34:36.470 --> 01:34:36.480 align:start position:0%
said in my testimony at the start
 
01:34:37.910 --> 01:34:37.920 align:start position:0%
nothing that we decide through an
 
01:34:39.590 --> 01:34:39.600 align:start position:0%
assessment process is going to tie their
 
01:34:41.669 --> 01:34:41.679 align:start position:0%
hands in terms of what they decide to do
 
01:34:43.270 --> 01:34:43.280 align:start position:0%
moving forward with the court process
 
01:34:45.430 --> 01:34:45.440 align:start position:0%
this is about providing alternatives
 
01:34:46.790 --> 01:34:46.800 align:start position:0%
providing information
 
01:34:49.669 --> 01:34:49.679 align:start position:0%
and what i think is going to happen is
 
01:34:50.709 --> 01:34:50.719 align:start position:0%
that we'll find
 
01:34:53.189 --> 01:34:53.199 align:start position:0%
that those folks who are skeptical will
 
01:34:54.790 --> 01:34:54.800 align:start position:0%
find that youth are doing better
 
01:34:57.830 --> 01:34:57.840 align:start position:0%
and at the end of the day they'll be
 
01:34:59.590 --> 01:34:59.600 align:start position:0%
happy with having another opportunity to
 
01:35:01.030 --> 01:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
have somebody else take a look at a kid
 
01:35:02.629 --> 01:35:02.639 align:start position:0%
and try to solve the problem
 
01:35:04.709 --> 01:35:04.719 align:start position:0%
but change is hard and i think that's
 
01:35:06.790 --> 01:35:06.800 align:start position:0%
part of what we're hearing
 
01:35:08.149 --> 01:35:08.159 align:start position:0%
right because we can't we can't be
 
01:35:09.830 --> 01:35:09.840 align:start position:0%
afraid to try new things
 
01:35:12.390 --> 01:35:12.400 align:start position:0%
you know then we're just stuck in the
 
01:35:13.990 --> 01:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
same old ruts
 
01:35:16.920 --> 01:35:16.930 align:start position:0%
great um okay representative long
 
01:35:16.930 --> 01:35:19.830 align:start position:0%
great um okay representative long
[Music]

01:35:19.830 --> 01:35:19.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:35:22.149 --> 01:35:22.159 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um actually that
 
01:35:23.990 --> 01:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
was one of my questions with respect to
 
01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:24.950 align:start position:0%
was one of my questions with respect to
police

01:35:24.950 --> 01:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
police
 
01:35:28.149 --> 01:35:28.159 align:start position:0%
it it appeared in the bill that they
 
01:35:30.149 --> 01:35:30.159 align:start position:0%
had a little more responsibility but
 
01:35:32.470 --> 01:35:32.480 align:start position:0%
then when i keep rereading it
 
01:35:35.270 --> 01:35:35.280 align:start position:0%
i mean it appears that they am i correct
 
01:35:36.950 --> 01:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
joe that they would
 
01:35:39.990 --> 01:35:40.000 align:start position:0%
uh the arresting officer would revert
 
01:35:41.990 --> 01:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
this to the agency which is
 
01:35:45.030 --> 01:35:45.040 align:start position:0%
the uh to to uh health and human
 
01:35:46.470 --> 01:35:46.480 align:start position:0%
services correct
 
01:35:48.550 --> 01:35:48.560 align:start position:0%
yeah yep their only responsibility is
 
01:35:49.830 --> 01:35:49.840 align:start position:0%
that um
 
01:35:51.669 --> 01:35:51.679 align:start position:0%
they can make a referral for any kid
 
01:35:53.270 --> 01:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
they come into contact with
 
01:35:54.870 --> 01:35:54.880 align:start position:0%
and if they think they're go if they
 
01:35:56.950 --> 01:35:56.960 align:start position:0%
plan to go to court then they shall make
 
01:35:58.550 --> 01:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
a referral before they go to court
 
01:36:00.070 --> 01:36:00.080 align:start position:0%
there is an exception for emergency
 
01:36:01.750 --> 01:36:01.760 align:start position:0%
situations right if you have something
 
01:36:01.760 --> 01:36:02.229 align:start position:0%
situations right if you have something
really

01:36:02.229 --> 01:36:02.239 align:start position:0%
really
 
01:36:03.830 --> 01:36:03.840 align:start position:0%
extreme that happens for which a kid
 
01:36:05.109 --> 01:36:05.119 align:start position:0%
requires immediate placement or
 
01:36:05.119 --> 01:36:05.990 align:start position:0%
requires immediate placement or
detention

01:36:05.990 --> 01:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
detention
 
01:36:07.510 --> 01:36:07.520 align:start position:0%
they don't need to wait for that process
 
01:36:08.470 --> 01:36:08.480 align:start position:0%
they can move forward with that and
 
01:36:10.229 --> 01:36:10.239 align:start position:0%
we'll do the assessment later
 
01:36:14.229 --> 01:36:14.239 align:start position:0%
um but that's a very very slim
 
01:36:15.990 --> 01:36:16.000 align:start position:0%
number of the cases that we get the vast
 
01:36:17.590 --> 01:36:17.600 align:start position:0%
majority of times
 
01:36:19.830 --> 01:36:19.840 align:start position:0%
um you know kids kids get arrested they
 
01:36:21.510 --> 01:36:21.520 align:start position:0%
get in trouble and it's a month or so
 
01:36:23.189 --> 01:36:23.199 align:start position:0%
before the case actually goes to court
 
01:36:24.950 --> 01:36:24.960 align:start position:0%
and the plan with this is that
 
01:36:26.550 --> 01:36:26.560 align:start position:0%
this intervention is going to occur
 
01:36:28.149 --> 01:36:28.159 align:start position:0%
within the first 30 days
 
01:36:29.669 --> 01:36:29.679 align:start position:0%
so that people have the opportunity to
 
01:36:30.870 --> 01:36:30.880 align:start position:0%
have this information when they make
 
01:36:31.830 --> 01:36:31.840 align:start position:0%
their decisions
 
01:36:33.189 --> 01:36:33.199 align:start position:0%
so yeah their only responsibility is
 
01:36:34.550 --> 01:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
gonna be to make a referral and then to
 
01:36:36.310 --> 01:36:36.320 align:start position:0%
get the feedback from us
 
01:36:37.750 --> 01:36:37.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you could i get a follow-up
 
01:36:39.910 --> 01:36:39.920 align:start position:0%
madam chair certainly
 
01:36:41.830 --> 01:36:41.840 align:start position:0%
uh actually joe do you have the bill in
 
01:36:43.030 --> 01:36:43.040 align:start position:0%
front of you by any chance
 
01:36:46.070 --> 01:36:46.080 align:start position:0%
yes uh actually
 
01:36:49.430 --> 01:36:49.440 align:start position:0%
on my same question that i had with
 
01:36:53.109 --> 01:36:53.119 align:start position:0%
mr skibby um which i'm
 
01:36:54.950 --> 01:36:54.960 align:start position:0%
becoming a little more comfortable that
 
01:36:56.310 --> 01:36:56.320 align:start position:0%
it's not a conflict but
 
01:37:00.470 --> 01:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
just to be clear on page 3
 
01:37:03.750 --> 01:37:03.760 align:start position:0%
line 16 it refers to the minor
 
01:37:06.470 --> 01:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
or the minor's parents or guardian not
 
01:37:08.790 --> 01:37:08.800 align:start position:0%
consenting to the assessment
 
01:37:12.310 --> 01:37:12.320 align:start position:0%
do you see i you know
 
01:37:15.510 --> 01:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
i i just don't want well i you know i
 
01:37:18.310 --> 01:37:18.320 align:start position:0%
don't want to see a parent coming to us
 
01:37:21.750 --> 01:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
down a line saying you know my rights
 
01:37:23.830 --> 01:37:23.840 align:start position:0%
were taken away from me because
 
01:37:25.750 --> 01:37:25.760 align:start position:0%
i thought this was in the best interest
 
01:37:27.750 --> 01:37:27.760 align:start position:0%
of my child my child didn't think so
 
01:37:31.830 --> 01:37:31.840 align:start position:0%
you know um so you don't you don't see
 
01:37:35.590 --> 01:37:35.600 align:start position:0%
um you don't see an issue with
 
01:37:38.790 --> 01:37:38.800 align:start position:0%
the beginning it starts with an end and
 
01:37:40.310 --> 01:37:40.320 align:start position:0%
in two spots it's an
 
01:37:43.590 --> 01:37:43.600 align:start position:0%
or i i don't think the ends are the ors
 
01:37:45.510 --> 01:37:45.520 align:start position:0%
are the challenge because the two ors
 
01:37:47.510 --> 01:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
are where it's a negative right
 
01:37:49.030 --> 01:37:49.040 align:start position:0%
if either party does not consent it
 
01:37:50.629 --> 01:37:50.639 align:start position:0%
can't proceed where the first one is an
 
01:37:51.910 --> 01:37:51.920 align:start position:0%
affirmative in order to start the
 
01:37:54.070 --> 01:37:54.080 align:start position:0%
process both parties must consent
 
01:37:55.910 --> 01:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
um i do think the issue they're raising
 
01:37:57.590 --> 01:37:57.600 align:start position:0%
is something that could happen
 
01:37:59.350 --> 01:37:59.360 align:start position:0%
right and and that's that's something
 
01:38:00.950 --> 01:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
that i think is going to have to need to
 
01:38:02.790 --> 01:38:02.800 align:start position:0%
remain in the bill the idea that we are
 
01:38:02.800 --> 01:38:03.990 align:start position:0%
remain in the bill the idea that we are
requiring

01:38:03.990 --> 01:38:04.000 align:start position:0%
requiring
 
01:38:06.310 --> 01:38:06.320 align:start position:0%
youth and parents to consent and part of
 
01:38:07.910 --> 01:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
that's because
 
01:38:10.070 --> 01:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
what we're doing here which is which
 
01:38:11.750 --> 01:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
isn't entirely natural but it's part of
 
01:38:13.510 --> 01:38:13.520 align:start position:0%
the evolution of juvenile justice
 
01:38:15.350 --> 01:38:15.360 align:start position:0%
is that we're kind of overlaying a
 
01:38:17.430 --> 01:38:17.440 align:start position:0%
treatment model into what's historically
 
01:38:19.109 --> 01:38:19.119 align:start position:0%
been a correctional model
 
01:38:21.189 --> 01:38:21.199 align:start position:0%
and in a correctional model right youth
 
01:38:23.189 --> 01:38:23.199 align:start position:0%
have attorneys and they have rights
 
01:38:26.550 --> 01:38:26.560 align:start position:0%
um even if parents disagree and i think
 
01:38:27.910 --> 01:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
that's that's really what's the
 
01:38:29.910 --> 01:38:29.920 align:start position:0%
discomfort in this space
 
01:38:31.510 --> 01:38:31.520 align:start position:0%
and maybe someday we move to a place
 
01:38:33.750 --> 01:38:33.760 align:start position:0%
where the systems are are more treatment
 
01:38:36.390 --> 01:38:36.400 align:start position:0%
based and those tensions go away but
 
01:38:38.229 --> 01:38:38.239 align:start position:0%
but as we are in the evolution of a
 
01:38:40.070 --> 01:38:40.080 align:start position:0%
system today i think we have to
 
01:38:41.750 --> 01:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
we have to structure in a way that that
 
01:38:43.669 --> 01:38:43.679 align:start position:0%
keeps youth rights in place
 
01:38:45.109 --> 01:38:45.119 align:start position:0%
with their council they're they have
 
01:38:46.470 --> 01:38:46.480 align:start position:0%
attorneys to represent them in these
 
01:38:46.480 --> 01:38:47.270 align:start position:0%
attorneys to represent them in these
matters

01:38:47.270 --> 01:38:47.280 align:start position:0%
matters
 
01:38:49.270 --> 01:38:49.280 align:start position:0%
um as well as parental rights in place
 
01:38:51.430 --> 01:38:51.440 align:start position:0%
to make these decisions
 
01:38:53.189 --> 01:38:53.199 align:start position:0%
may i have one more uh amount of chair
 
01:38:53.199 --> 01:38:54.629 align:start position:0%
may i have one more uh amount of chair
yeah

01:38:54.629 --> 01:38:54.639 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:38:58.390 --> 01:38:58.400 align:start position:0%
thank you uh now at this point
 
01:39:00.950 --> 01:39:00.960 align:start position:0%
there's not an attorney assigned correct
 
01:39:02.470 --> 01:39:02.480 align:start position:0%
because there hasn't been any filing
 
01:39:03.270 --> 01:39:03.280 align:start position:0%
with the courts
 
01:39:05.590 --> 01:39:05.600 align:start position:0%
am i correct in that yeah at the point
 
01:39:07.270 --> 01:39:07.280 align:start position:0%
of the initial assessment there would be
 
01:39:09.109 --> 01:39:09.119 align:start position:0%
no counsel yet assigned okay
 
01:39:11.109 --> 01:39:11.119 align:start position:0%
okay thank you yep and that's part of
 
01:39:12.950 --> 01:39:12.960 align:start position:0%
the reason why we put this later consent
 
01:39:14.709 --> 01:39:14.719 align:start position:0%
provision in before it can go to court
 
01:39:16.870 --> 01:39:16.880 align:start position:0%
um to to address that situation right i
 
01:39:19.590 --> 01:39:19.600 align:start position:0%
think an ideal system without regard to
 
01:39:21.270 --> 01:39:21.280 align:start position:0%
cost you would have an attorney assigned
 
01:39:22.550 --> 01:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
at the point of an assessment but that
 
01:39:23.669 --> 01:39:23.679 align:start position:0%
would really drive up
 
01:39:25.030 --> 01:39:25.040 align:start position:0%
the cost of a bill and you know i
 
01:39:26.470 --> 01:39:26.480 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be opposed to that but that's a
 
01:39:27.830 --> 01:39:27.840 align:start position:0%
that's another that's a much bigger

01:40:59.590 --> 01:40:59.600 align:start position:0%
center we all
 
01:41:01.350 --> 01:41:01.360 align:start position:0%
are working towards a common purpose of
 
01:41:03.510 --> 01:41:03.520 align:start position:0%
improving services for juveniles
 
01:41:05.030 --> 01:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
and new hampshire public defender
 
01:41:07.189 --> 01:41:07.199 align:start position:0%
supports all initiatives with that
 
01:41:07.199 --> 01:41:08.310 align:start position:0%
supports all initiatives with that
agenda

01:41:08.310 --> 01:41:08.320 align:start position:0%
agenda
 
01:41:11.030 --> 01:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
we support the passing of sb 94 in
 
01:41:11.040 --> 01:41:12.070 align:start position:0%
we support the passing of sb 94 in
particular

01:41:12.070 --> 01:41:12.080 align:start position:0%
particular
 
01:41:15.109 --> 01:41:15.119 align:start position:0%
because the goal of sb 94 is to decrease
 
01:41:17.990 --> 01:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
the number of system-involved youth to
 
01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:18.629 align:start position:0%
the number of system-involved youth to
divert

01:41:18.629 --> 01:41:18.639 align:start position:0%
divert
 
01:41:20.870 --> 01:41:20.880 align:start position:0%
formally and informally youth away from
 
01:41:22.149 --> 01:41:22.159 align:start position:0%
the system
 
01:41:24.229 --> 01:41:24.239 align:start position:0%
to offer services that are indeed
 
01:41:25.590 --> 01:41:25.600 align:start position:0%
individualized and
 
01:41:28.470 --> 01:41:28.480 align:start position:0%
to the youth specific needs for those
 
01:41:30.149 --> 01:41:30.159 align:start position:0%
reasons we support the bill
 
01:41:32.070 --> 01:41:32.080 align:start position:0%
we support it because it comes from a
 
01:41:34.149 --> 01:41:34.159 align:start position:0%
place of understanding adolescent brain
 
01:41:34.159 --> 01:41:35.270 align:start position:0%
place of understanding adolescent brain
development

01:41:35.270 --> 01:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
development
 
01:41:39.030 --> 01:41:39.040 align:start position:0%
and and that youths brains are not fully
 
01:41:40.709 --> 01:41:40.719 align:start position:0%
developed until they are 25
 
01:41:42.870 --> 01:41:42.880 align:start position:0%
making them less culpable and more
 
01:41:42.880 --> 01:41:43.750 align:start position:0%
making them less culpable and more
likely

01:41:43.750 --> 01:41:43.760 align:start position:0%
likely
 
01:41:46.149 --> 01:41:46.159 align:start position:0%
to grow out of behavior that leads to
 
01:41:46.159 --> 01:41:47.990 align:start position:0%
to grow out of behavior that leads to
delinquency

01:41:47.990 --> 01:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
delinquency
 
01:41:50.149 --> 01:41:50.159 align:start position:0%
we know that keeping kids out of the
 
01:41:51.830 --> 01:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
juvenile justice system
 
01:41:54.629 --> 01:41:54.639 align:start position:0%
makes it so they grow into mature
 
01:41:57.030 --> 01:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
law-abiding adults as opposed
 
01:41:59.030 --> 01:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
to higher recidivism rates that we've
 
01:42:01.910 --> 01:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
seen for kids who are in the system
 
01:42:04.629 --> 01:42:04.639 align:start position:0%
sb 94 provides for kids who must come
 
01:42:07.109 --> 01:42:07.119 align:start position:0%
into the system and who do need services
 
01:42:09.109 --> 01:42:09.119 align:start position:0%
to have an assessment that will inform
 
01:42:11.030 --> 01:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
all of those needs
 
01:42:13.750 --> 01:42:13.760 align:start position:0%
and strengths of the youth and result
 
01:42:15.750 --> 01:42:15.760 align:start position:0%
hopefully in a more developmentally and
 
01:42:19.430 --> 01:42:19.440 align:start position:0%
individualized plan for the youth
 
01:42:22.550 --> 01:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
the hope is through sb 94 and the
 
01:42:23.830 --> 01:42:23.840 align:start position:0%
collection of data
 
01:42:26.629 --> 01:42:26.639 align:start position:0%
that the racial inequities that are that
 
01:42:28.310 --> 01:42:28.320 align:start position:0%
are apparent in the juvenile justice
 
01:42:29.830 --> 01:42:29.840 align:start position:0%
system will be addressed
 
01:42:31.510 --> 01:42:31.520 align:start position:0%
as we know black and brown youth are
 
01:42:33.109 --> 01:42:33.119 align:start position:0%
over represented in the system
 
01:42:34.950 --> 01:42:34.960 align:start position:0%
across the board from the point of
 
01:42:37.750 --> 01:42:37.760 align:start position:0%
arrest to disposition and commitment to
 
01:42:37.760 --> 01:42:39.030 align:start position:0%
arrest to disposition and commitment to
sysc

01:42:39.030 --> 01:42:39.040 align:start position:0%
sysc
 
01:42:41.189 --> 01:42:41.199 align:start position:0%
for all of these reasons the public
 
01:42:41.199 --> 01:42:42.070 align:start position:0%
for all of these reasons the public
defender

01:42:42.070 --> 01:42:42.080 align:start position:0%
defender
 
01:42:45.350 --> 01:42:45.360 align:start position:0%
supports the passing of sb 94. i support
 
01:42:47.189 --> 01:42:47.199 align:start position:0%
the passing of sb94
 
01:42:51.030 --> 01:42:51.040 align:start position:0%

01:42:52.550 --> 01:42:52.560 align:start position:0%

01:42:58.550 --> 01:42:58.560 align:start position:0%

01:42:58.560 --> 01:42:59.910 align:start position:0%
uh representative long has a question
certainly

01:42:59.910 --> 01:42:59.920 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
01:43:02.629 --> 01:43:02.639 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh and thank you
 
01:43:03.189 --> 01:43:03.199 align:start position:0%
for your
 
01:43:05.350 --> 01:43:05.360 align:start position:0%
due diligence on this uh thank you for
 
01:43:06.390 --> 01:43:06.400 align:start position:0%
your involvement
 
01:43:10.709 --> 01:43:10.719 align:start position:0%
uh absolutely
 
01:43:14.390 --> 01:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
the ac applicability um is there a
 
01:43:15.910 --> 01:43:15.920 align:start position:0%
reason why
 
01:43:18.950 --> 01:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
where you know it goes from
 
01:43:23.430 --> 01:43:23.440 align:start position:0%
january of 22 to july of 22 to october
 
01:43:27.030 --> 01:43:27.040 align:start position:0%
of 22 for different courts is was there
 
01:43:30.229 --> 01:43:30.239 align:start position:0%
some reasoning behind that i i think if
 
01:43:30.239 --> 01:43:31.590 align:start position:0%
some reasoning behind that i i think if
i'm

01:43:31.590 --> 01:43:31.600 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
01:43:33.430 --> 01:43:33.440 align:start position:0%
if i'm correct on this and of course joe
 
01:43:35.109 --> 01:43:35.119 align:start position:0%
can um answer this better
 
01:43:37.669 --> 01:43:37.679 align:start position:0%
but i don't think he's still here but um
 
01:43:38.629 --> 01:43:38.639 align:start position:0%
the idea was
 
01:43:41.270 --> 01:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
that this is a lot to implement um it's
 
01:43:43.590 --> 01:43:43.600 align:start position:0%
going to take a lot of
 
01:43:45.430 --> 01:43:45.440 align:start position:0%
details and so the thought was that we
 
01:43:47.189 --> 01:43:47.199 align:start position:0%
would implement it slowly and we would
 
01:43:49.270 --> 01:43:49.280 align:start position:0%
start in one you know one place to the
 
01:43:50.470 --> 01:43:50.480 align:start position:0%
next to the next
 
01:43:51.669 --> 01:43:51.679 align:start position:0%
and really it's simply about
 
01:43:53.830 --> 01:43:53.840 align:start position:0%
implementation you know to make it
 
01:43:56.870 --> 01:43:56.880 align:start position:0%
smooth and frankly i think the the
 
01:43:58.629 --> 01:43:58.639 align:start position:0%
places that were contemplated were
 
01:44:01.270 --> 01:44:01.280 align:start position:0%
because there are heavy juvenile dockets
 
01:44:03.189 --> 01:44:03.199 align:start position:0%
there are very involved juvenile judges
 
01:44:04.149 --> 01:44:04.159 align:start position:0%
in those
 
01:44:06.790 --> 01:44:06.800 align:start position:0%
areas and you know they will be ready to
 
01:44:08.629 --> 01:44:08.639 align:start position:0%
take this on and so then it
 
01:44:10.870 --> 01:44:10.880 align:start position:0%
will figure out the kinks and then when
 
01:44:12.950 --> 01:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
we get to the other courts it'll be
 
01:44:14.790 --> 01:44:14.800 align:start position:0%
much smoother at that point so i think i
 
01:44:16.950 --> 01:44:16.960 align:start position:0%
believe that was the primary reasoning
 
01:44:17.830 --> 01:44:17.840 align:start position:0%
for that
 
01:44:21.030 --> 01:44:21.040 align:start position:0%
okay thank you you're welcome
 
01:44:24.470 --> 01:44:24.480 align:start position:0%
i think that was a good reason yes
 
01:44:29.109 --> 01:44:29.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:30.550 --> 01:44:30.560 align:start position:0%
all right saying none thank you very
 
01:44:34.310 --> 01:44:34.320 align:start position:0%
much miss jones thank you
 
01:44:40.870 --> 01:44:40.880 align:start position:0%

01:45:08.310 --> 01:45:08.320 align:start position:0%

01:45:12.149 --> 01:45:12.159 align:start position:0%
try to research them but
 
01:45:13.510 --> 01:45:13.520 align:start position:0%
we just wanted to say we support the
 
01:45:16.629 --> 01:45:16.639 align:start position:0%
bill as presented thank you i'd be happy
 
01:45:17.910 --> 01:45:17.920 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions or
 
01:45:19.750 --> 01:45:19.760 align:start position:0%
at least try to in judge ashley's
 
01:45:19.760 --> 01:45:21.030 align:start position:0%
at least try to in judge ashley's
absence

01:45:21.030 --> 01:45:21.040 align:start position:0%
absence
 
01:45:25.830 --> 01:45:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:29.590 --> 01:45:29.600 align:start position:0%
all right oh representative
 
01:45:31.990 --> 01:45:32.000 align:start position:0%
take long out of chair just just it
 
01:45:33.910 --> 01:45:33.920 align:start position:0%
would be helpful because i'm looking
 
01:45:37.750 --> 01:45:37.760 align:start position:0%
at the aqua um when they go into an
 
01:45:39.590 --> 01:45:39.600 align:start position:0%
effect and i see manchester has
 
01:45:42.149 --> 01:45:42.159 align:start position:0%
one of the last ones um you know which
 
01:45:44.149 --> 01:45:44.159 align:start position:0%
is okay but i'm wondering mr head if you
 
01:45:45.669 --> 01:45:45.679 align:start position:0%
would have
 
01:45:49.109 --> 01:45:49.119 align:start position:0%
uh case numbers i mean you know
 
01:45:53.109 --> 01:45:53.119 align:start position:0%
the amount of cases in the nine circuits
 
01:45:55.270 --> 01:45:55.280 align:start position:0%
because i'm thinking maybe that's why
 
01:45:57.350 --> 01:45:57.360 align:start position:0%
they separated it too
 
01:45:59.430 --> 01:45:59.440 align:start position:0%
uh because i see nashua has one of the
 
01:46:01.350 --> 01:46:01.360 align:start position:0%
first so there's probably a lot of
 
01:46:02.790 --> 01:46:02.800 align:start position:0%
caseload there
 
01:46:06.070 --> 01:46:06.080 align:start position:0%
um so would you have that by
 
01:46:09.109 --> 01:46:09.119 align:start position:0%
i mean not today but could the committee
 
01:46:12.470 --> 01:46:12.480 align:start position:0%
get that breakdown i can certainly um
 
01:46:14.709 --> 01:46:14.719 align:start position:0%
uh see what i can get for you and and
 
01:46:16.629 --> 01:46:16.639 align:start position:0%
get that to the committee we do also
 
01:46:16.639 --> 01:46:17.270 align:start position:0%
get that to the committee we do also
have

01:46:17.270 --> 01:46:17.280 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:46:20.950 --> 01:46:20.960 align:start position:0%
um some number of statistics on our um
 
01:46:22.870 --> 01:46:22.880 align:start position:0%
on the website so it may just be
 
01:46:24.310 --> 01:46:24.320 align:start position:0%
publicly available too but either which
 
01:46:26.149 --> 01:46:26.159 align:start position:0%
way i will get you either a link or the
 
01:46:26.159 --> 01:46:27.109 align:start position:0%
way i will get you either a link or the
data

01:46:27.109 --> 01:46:27.119 align:start position:0%
data
 
01:46:29.830 --> 01:46:29.840 align:start position:0%
um regarding number of cases okay thank
 
01:46:29.840 --> 01:46:31.990 align:start position:0%
um regarding number of cases okay thank
you

01:46:31.990 --> 01:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:46:33.750 --> 01:46:33.760 align:start position:0%
representative long if you like i can
 
01:46:35.109 --> 01:46:35.119 align:start position:0%
see if director rips and
 
01:46:37.590 --> 01:46:37.600 align:start position:0%
come back on so he can answer that that
 
01:46:39.350 --> 01:46:39.360 align:start position:0%
question for you
 
01:46:41.669 --> 01:46:41.679 align:start position:0%
you know that that that'd be great
 
01:46:42.390 --> 01:46:42.400 align:start position:0%
because i i
 
01:46:45.270 --> 01:46:45.280 align:start position:0%
you know i i don't even know if they can
 
01:46:46.229 --> 01:46:46.239 align:start position:0%
get a number
 
01:46:48.470 --> 01:46:48.480 align:start position:0%
um because this is unique you know
 
01:46:50.229 --> 01:46:50.239 align:start position:0%
they've got to agree to assessments and
 
01:46:51.430 --> 01:46:51.440 align:start position:0%
all that stuff so
 
01:46:53.510 --> 01:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
okay so represent so are there any
 
01:46:56.709 --> 01:46:56.719 align:start position:0%
further questions for mr head
 
01:46:58.790 --> 01:46:58.800 align:start position:0%
okay see none thank you very much mr
 
01:47:00.229 --> 01:47:00.239 align:start position:0%
head and i'm going to call
 
01:47:02.229 --> 01:47:02.239 align:start position:0%
director ribson back up so that he can
 
01:47:05.750 --> 01:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
address representative long's questions
 
01:47:09.030 --> 01:47:09.040 align:start position:0%
he is unmuted yeah you're unmuted
 
01:47:12.070 --> 01:47:12.080 align:start position:0%
director great thank you madam chair um
 
01:47:13.669 --> 01:47:13.679 align:start position:0%
yes i don't have the exact numbers in
 
01:47:15.270 --> 01:47:15.280 align:start position:0%
front of me although probably in five
 
01:47:16.950 --> 01:47:16.960 align:start position:0%
minutes i could pull up some numbers
 
01:47:18.950 --> 01:47:18.960 align:start position:0%
um i just have to go into our data
 
01:47:20.709 --> 01:47:20.719 align:start position:0%
system um but yes
 
01:47:23.430 --> 01:47:23.440 align:start position:0%
the part of the rationale for for the
 
01:47:24.229 --> 01:47:24.239 align:start position:0%
rollout was
 
01:47:27.669 --> 01:47:27.679 align:start position:0%
as as ms jones explained um one having
 
01:47:29.030 --> 01:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
appropriate time to implement it in
 
01:47:31.109 --> 01:47:31.119 align:start position:0%
different places um part of this
 
01:47:33.270 --> 01:47:33.280 align:start position:0%
is we're shifting the role of some of
 
01:47:35.350 --> 01:47:35.360 align:start position:0%
our staff so staff who historically have
 
01:47:37.030 --> 01:47:37.040 align:start position:0%
only done probation and parole
 
01:47:38.950 --> 01:47:38.960 align:start position:0%
oversight for open court cases are going
 
01:47:40.310 --> 01:47:40.320 align:start position:0%
to move into this new role of doing
 
01:47:42.310 --> 01:47:42.320 align:start position:0%
these assessments up front
 
01:47:44.149 --> 01:47:44.159 align:start position:0%
and we're we're counting on the reality
 
01:47:45.590 --> 01:47:45.600 align:start position:0%
that we're going to have fewer deep end
 
01:47:47.109 --> 01:47:47.119 align:start position:0%
cases meaning we have more
 
01:47:49.030 --> 01:47:49.040 align:start position:0%
workforce to do the front-end work right
 
01:47:50.870 --> 01:47:50.880 align:start position:0%
so we have to move it over time so that
 
01:47:52.310 --> 01:47:52.320 align:start position:0%
we can shift staff
 
01:47:53.750 --> 01:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
from one end of the system to the other
 
01:47:55.669 --> 01:47:55.679 align:start position:0%
end of the system and then
 
01:47:57.109 --> 01:47:57.119 align:start position:0%
so that was the reason why we had to
 
01:47:58.790 --> 01:47:58.800 align:start position:0%
implement slowly over time
 
01:48:00.470 --> 01:48:00.480 align:start position:0%
i mean it's not that slowly it's over i
 
01:48:02.229 --> 01:48:02.239 align:start position:0%
think three different quarters
 
01:48:05.189 --> 01:48:05.199 align:start position:0%
but then the the choice of where to set
 
01:48:06.870 --> 01:48:06.880 align:start position:0%
that up was based on
 
01:48:08.870 --> 01:48:08.880 align:start position:0%
uh making sure of a couple different
 
01:48:10.229 --> 01:48:10.239 align:start position:0%
things um
 
01:48:12.390 --> 01:48:12.400 align:start position:0%
one that we weren't overwhelming the
 
01:48:13.910 --> 01:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
system by having you know the two
 
01:48:15.669 --> 01:48:15.679 align:start position:0%
biggest parts of the state combined at
 
01:48:16.950 --> 01:48:16.960 align:start position:0%
the same time which would be as you
 
01:48:19.109 --> 01:48:19.119 align:start position:0%
alluded to nashua and manchester
 
01:48:21.590 --> 01:48:21.600 align:start position:0%
um and two the places where it seemed
 
01:48:22.790 --> 01:48:22.800 align:start position:0%
like we had
 
01:48:24.870 --> 01:48:24.880 align:start position:0%
um the easiest choosing for the very
 
01:48:26.149 --> 01:48:26.159 align:start position:0%
first one the places where we seemed
 
01:48:27.430 --> 01:48:27.440 align:start position:0%
that we had the easiest collaboration
 
01:48:28.950 --> 01:48:28.960 align:start position:0%
between public defenders
 
01:48:32.070 --> 01:48:32.080 align:start position:0%
prosecutors jppos courts
 
01:48:34.390 --> 01:48:34.400 align:start position:0%
who were kind of naturally on the same
 
01:48:35.189 --> 01:48:35.199 align:start position:0%
page around this
 
01:48:36.629 --> 01:48:36.639 align:start position:0%
so that we can kind of test it out with
 
01:48:38.229 --> 01:48:38.239 align:start position:0%
them work out the kinks with them before
 
01:48:39.990 --> 01:48:40.000 align:start position:0%
we rolled into other places
 
01:48:41.189 --> 01:48:41.199 align:start position:0%
um where maybe those relationships
 
01:48:43.270 --> 01:48:43.280 align:start position:0%
weren't quite as strong yet um so those
 
01:48:44.070 --> 01:48:44.080 align:start position:0%
were the reasons
 
01:48:45.510 --> 01:48:45.520 align:start position:0%
although i like i said at the end of the
 
01:48:47.430 --> 01:48:47.440 align:start position:0%
day i think this is i think this is
 
01:48:48.870 --> 01:48:48.880 align:start position:0%
going to be good for everybody
 
01:48:50.629 --> 01:48:50.639 align:start position:0%
but um we tried to structure in a way
 
01:48:51.990 --> 01:48:52.000 align:start position:0%
that it would be successful and didn't
 
01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:52.870 align:start position:0%
that it would be successful and didn't
just

01:48:52.870 --> 01:48:52.880 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:48:54.790 --> 01:48:54.800 align:start position:0%
just open up the doors and not be ready
 
01:48:58.470 --> 01:48:58.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:00.790 --> 01:49:00.800 align:start position:0%
okay great thank you so much does that
 
01:49:01.910 --> 01:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
does that help you out
 
01:49:04.950 --> 01:49:04.960 align:start position:0%
representative long it does immensely
 
01:49:05.750 --> 01:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:49:08.950 --> 01:49:08.960 align:start position:0%
right thanks okay up next
 
01:49:12.790 --> 01:49:12.800 align:start position:0%
is um moira o'neil the director of the
 
01:49:15.270 --> 01:49:15.280 align:start position:0%
office of the child advocate
 
01:49:17.109 --> 01:49:17.119 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um thank you
 
01:49:18.310 --> 01:49:18.320 align:start position:0%
committee for um
 
01:49:20.470 --> 01:49:20.480 align:start position:0%
for hearing my testimony for the record
 
01:49:22.070 --> 01:49:22.080 align:start position:0%
my name is moira o'neil
 
01:49:23.589 --> 01:49:23.599 align:start position:0%
i am the new hampshire state child
 
01:49:26.070 --> 01:49:26.080 align:start position:0%
advocate and i am happy to support
 
01:49:28.070 --> 01:49:28.080 align:start position:0%
senate bill 94 relative to juvenile
 
01:49:30.709 --> 01:49:30.719 align:start position:0%
diversion programs i am also a member of
 
01:49:32.070 --> 01:49:32.080 align:start position:0%
the juvenile
 
01:49:34.470 --> 01:49:34.480 align:start position:0%
transformation team um and just to give
 
01:49:35.669 --> 01:49:35.679 align:start position:0%
you a little context
 
01:49:38.149 --> 01:49:38.159 align:start position:0%
since we all went together to washington
 
01:49:40.870 --> 01:49:40.880 align:start position:0%
dc pre pandemic for an entire week
 
01:49:43.589 --> 01:49:43.599 align:start position:0%
the most intensive week of my life of
 
01:49:45.430 --> 01:49:45.440 align:start position:0%
training and education
 
01:49:47.430 --> 01:49:47.440 align:start position:0%
we have been meeting sometimes three and
 
01:49:48.790 --> 01:49:48.800 align:start position:0%
four times a week
 
01:49:51.270 --> 01:49:51.280 align:start position:0%
since then working on this project and
 
01:49:52.709 --> 01:49:52.719 align:start position:0%
it's been a phenomenally
 
01:49:55.189 --> 01:49:55.199 align:start position:0%
interdisciplinary process
 
01:49:58.229 --> 01:49:58.239 align:start position:0%
and we've come to really appreciate both
 
01:50:01.109 --> 01:50:01.119 align:start position:0%
each other and um and the the commitment
 
01:50:01.669 --> 01:50:01.679 align:start position:0%
for this
 
01:50:03.189 --> 01:50:03.199 align:start position:0%
for for the for the broader
 
01:50:05.510 --> 01:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
transformation of juvenile justice so
 
01:50:07.189 --> 01:50:07.199 align:start position:0%
i'm very pleased to be able to support
 
01:50:08.790 --> 01:50:08.800 align:start position:0%
this bill um and
 
01:50:10.790 --> 01:50:10.800 align:start position:0%
i just want to emphasize a little bit
 
01:50:11.910 --> 01:50:11.920 align:start position:0%
that senate bill
 
01:50:15.270 --> 01:50:15.280 align:start position:0%
94 is about prevention it provides for a
 
01:50:16.550 --> 01:50:16.560 align:start position:0%
child to obtain this
 
01:50:18.070 --> 01:50:18.080 align:start position:0%
voluntary strengths-based needs
 
01:50:20.709 --> 01:50:20.719 align:start position:0%
assessment before the petition is filed
 
01:50:23.270 --> 01:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
um and just to give a little context
 
01:50:25.189 --> 01:50:25.199 align:start position:0%
when it when a child breaks a law or a
 
01:50:25.199 --> 01:50:25.589 align:start position:0%
when it when a child breaks a law or a
rule

01:50:25.589 --> 01:50:25.599 align:start position:0%
rule
 
01:50:27.669 --> 01:50:27.679 align:start position:0%
there are potentially four conditions
 
01:50:30.149 --> 01:50:30.159 align:start position:0%
one it may be youthful in discretion
 
01:50:31.990 --> 01:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
which is more about immaturity than
 
01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:33.189 align:start position:0%
which is more about immaturity than
criminality

01:50:33.189 --> 01:50:33.199 align:start position:0%
criminality
 
01:50:35.430 --> 01:50:35.440 align:start position:0%
um there may be developmental disability
 
01:50:36.950 --> 01:50:36.960 align:start position:0%
or mental illness which is about
 
01:50:39.030 --> 01:50:39.040 align:start position:0%
disruption and development or an illness
 
01:50:39.830 --> 01:50:39.840 align:start position:0%
and a resulting
 
01:50:41.830 --> 01:50:41.840 align:start position:0%
incapacity for the insight about what
 
01:50:43.109 --> 01:50:43.119 align:start position:0%
the child's doing
 
01:50:44.629 --> 01:50:44.639 align:start position:0%
there may be adverse childhood
 
01:50:46.709 --> 01:50:46.719 align:start position:0%
experiences in which children's actions
 
01:50:49.109 --> 01:50:49.119 align:start position:0%
are influenced by the adverse factors
 
01:50:51.750 --> 01:50:51.760 align:start position:0%
of their lives such as poverty hunger
 
01:50:53.750 --> 01:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
exposure to substance abuse and family
 
01:50:53.760 --> 01:50:55.189 align:start position:0%
exposure to substance abuse and family
dysfunction

01:50:55.189 --> 01:50:55.199 align:start position:0%
dysfunction
 
01:50:57.350 --> 01:50:57.360 align:start position:0%
and there may be a social pathology or
 
01:50:58.950 --> 01:50:58.960 align:start position:0%
an intentional criminology which is
 
01:51:01.030 --> 01:51:01.040 align:start position:0%
actually fairly rare amongst young
 
01:51:05.189 --> 01:51:05.199 align:start position:0%
young children so under senate bill 94
 
01:51:08.070 --> 01:51:08.080 align:start position:0%
a police officer can still address
 
01:51:10.390 --> 01:51:10.400 align:start position:0%
youthful indiscretion by counseling that
 
01:51:11.669 --> 01:51:11.679 align:start position:0%
child and sending them home
 
01:51:14.149 --> 01:51:14.159 align:start position:0%
to his parents um and you know for
 
01:51:15.510 --> 01:51:15.520 align:start position:0%
lessons learned
 
01:51:17.189 --> 01:51:17.199 align:start position:0%
but for those children who are not
 
01:51:19.109 --> 01:51:19.119 align:start position:0%
immediately sent home with disability
 
01:51:20.790 --> 01:51:20.800 align:start position:0%
or an adverse influence will be
 
01:51:23.669 --> 01:51:23.679 align:start position:0%
identified in this assessment process
 
01:51:25.350 --> 01:51:25.360 align:start position:0%
and through that process solutions will
 
01:51:27.430 --> 01:51:27.440 align:start position:0%
be sorted out to best help the child in
 
01:51:28.310 --> 01:51:28.320 align:start position:0%
the family
 
01:51:30.149 --> 01:51:30.159 align:start position:0%
whether it will be clinical help
 
01:51:31.830 --> 01:51:31.840 align:start position:0%
educational help or perhaps some
 
01:51:31.840 --> 01:51:32.390 align:start position:0%
educational help or perhaps some
targeted

01:51:32.390 --> 01:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
targeted
 
01:51:35.350 --> 01:51:35.360 align:start position:0%
social supports and i want to emphasize
 
01:51:37.430 --> 01:51:37.440 align:start position:0%
that the purpose of assessing
 
01:51:40.310 --> 01:51:40.320 align:start position:0%
needs is to determine whether if you
 
01:51:41.750 --> 01:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
mitigate that need
 
01:51:43.910 --> 01:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
you can also mitigate the risk of the
 
01:51:45.910 --> 01:51:45.920 align:start position:0%
child's behavior towards the community
 
01:51:46.470 --> 01:51:46.480 align:start position:0%
so this
 
01:51:48.870 --> 01:51:48.880 align:start position:0%
is an essentially a sort of law
 
01:51:50.870 --> 01:51:50.880 align:start position:0%
enforcement effort and that we're trying
 
01:51:51.990 --> 01:51:52.000 align:start position:0%
to make sure that
 
01:51:53.830 --> 01:51:53.840 align:start position:0%
um when children's needs are met so that
 
01:51:55.430 --> 01:51:55.440 align:start position:0%
they're so that they're not at risk for
 
01:51:55.440 --> 01:51:56.629 align:start position:0%
they're so that they're not at risk for
society

01:51:56.629 --> 01:51:56.639 align:start position:0%
society
 
01:51:59.189 --> 01:51:59.199 align:start position:0%
and while probation may feel intuitively
 
01:52:00.149 --> 01:52:00.159 align:start position:0%
like it's going to stop
 
01:52:02.470 --> 01:52:02.480 align:start position:0%
problem behavior what we've learned in
 
01:52:03.830 --> 01:52:03.840 align:start position:0%
the past year and a half
 
01:52:06.950 --> 01:52:06.960 align:start position:0%
is that it actually doesn't um in
 
01:52:08.950 --> 01:52:08.960 align:start position:0%
any involvement in fact in the juvenile
 
01:52:11.510 --> 01:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
justice system is a primary indicator of
 
01:52:11.520 --> 01:52:12.790 align:start position:0%
justice system is a primary indicator of
reoffending

01:52:12.790 --> 01:52:12.800 align:start position:0%
reoffending
 
01:52:14.950 --> 01:52:14.960 align:start position:0%
of poor school performance and of other
 
01:52:16.470 --> 01:52:16.480 align:start position:0%
negative outcomes
 
01:52:18.629 --> 01:52:18.639 align:start position:0%
in fact children who are diverted from
 
01:52:20.550 --> 01:52:20.560 align:start position:0%
the system are far less likely to be
 
01:52:22.550 --> 01:52:22.560 align:start position:0%
suspended from school
 
01:52:23.990 --> 01:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
so when their needs are met the
 
01:52:26.870 --> 01:52:26.880 align:start position:0%
incidence of reoffending is lowered
 
01:52:29.350 --> 01:52:29.360 align:start position:0%
and this is consistent with what you've
 
01:52:30.229 --> 01:52:30.239 align:start position:0%
heard from me
 
01:52:32.070 --> 01:52:32.080 align:start position:0%
about children's brain development and
 
01:52:33.270 --> 01:52:33.280 align:start position:0%
past hearings
 
01:52:35.830 --> 01:52:35.840 align:start position:0%
and attorney joan jones mentioned that
 
01:52:37.030 --> 01:52:37.040 align:start position:0%
brain development
 
01:52:39.030 --> 01:52:39.040 align:start position:0%
is in the context of culpability that
 
01:52:40.629 --> 01:52:40.639 align:start position:0%
children don't understand
 
01:52:42.310 --> 01:52:42.320 align:start position:0%
but equally as important is the
 
01:52:44.070 --> 01:52:44.080 align:start position:0%
malleability of the child's brain
 
01:52:46.390 --> 01:52:46.400 align:start position:0%
means that they can learn and they can
 
01:52:48.629 --> 01:52:48.639 align:start position:0%
adjust their antisocial behavior in the
 
01:52:50.390 --> 01:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
right conditions so we're trying to
 
01:52:52.070 --> 01:52:52.080 align:start position:0%
create the right conditions for these
 
01:52:52.080 --> 01:52:53.270 align:start position:0%
create the right conditions for these
kids

01:52:53.270 --> 01:52:53.280 align:start position:0%
kids
 
01:52:55.589 --> 01:52:55.599 align:start position:0%
and as you also know and i think that
 
01:52:57.350 --> 01:52:57.360 align:start position:0%
attorney skippy mentioned
 
01:52:59.510 --> 01:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
about the majority of children coming
 
01:53:01.189 --> 01:53:01.199 align:start position:0%
into the system
 
01:53:03.430 --> 01:53:03.440 align:start position:0%
more not because of serious offenses but
 
01:53:05.109 --> 01:53:05.119 align:start position:0%
because of a lack of understanding about
 
01:53:07.189 --> 01:53:07.199 align:start position:0%
their needs or the inability to access
 
01:53:07.199 --> 01:53:07.990 align:start position:0%
their needs or the inability to access
services

01:53:07.990 --> 01:53:08.000 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:53:09.350 --> 01:53:09.360 align:start position:0%
you know there's too many kids in the
 
01:53:11.990 --> 01:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
system who have mental health disorders
 
01:53:14.550 --> 01:53:14.560 align:start position:0%
identified um so this will address those
 
01:53:14.560 --> 01:53:15.350 align:start position:0%
identified um so this will address those
without

01:53:15.350 --> 01:53:15.360 align:start position:0%
without
 
01:53:18.629 --> 01:53:18.639 align:start position:0%
encumbering the system quite frankly our
 
01:53:20.229 --> 01:53:20.239 align:start position:0%
office the office of the child advocate
 
01:53:22.229 --> 01:53:22.239 align:start position:0%
encounters children regularly who could
 
01:53:23.910 --> 01:53:23.920 align:start position:0%
benefit from the proposed needs
 
01:53:26.390 --> 01:53:26.400 align:start position:0%
assessment in senate bill 94
 
01:53:28.149 --> 01:53:28.159 align:start position:0%
and certainly from avoiding the system
 
01:53:29.910 --> 01:53:29.920 align:start position:0%
involvement that they're in once we
 
01:53:33.910 --> 01:53:33.920 align:start position:0%
we've met them children themselves
 
01:53:35.750 --> 01:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
know that their parents need mental
 
01:53:37.430 --> 01:53:37.440 align:start position:0%
health or substance use treatment in
 
01:53:39.669 --> 01:53:39.679 align:start position:0%
addition to whatever their needs are
 
01:53:41.830 --> 01:53:41.840 align:start position:0%
to your question madam chair about law
 
01:53:44.390 --> 01:53:44.400 align:start position:0%
enforcement objecting to this bill
 
01:53:46.390 --> 01:53:46.400 align:start position:0%
one police officer recently told us in
 
01:53:48.550 --> 01:53:48.560 align:start position:0%
one of our affinity groups that
 
01:53:50.550 --> 01:53:50.560 align:start position:0%
children are better off in the juvenile
 
01:53:52.390 --> 01:53:52.400 align:start position:0%
justice system because their parents are
 
01:53:53.669 --> 01:53:53.679 align:start position:0%
so dysfunctional
 
01:53:56.229 --> 01:53:56.239 align:start position:0%
and unable to help them and and we know
 
01:53:57.589 --> 01:53:57.599 align:start position:0%
this is an ineffective way to do
 
01:53:59.910 --> 01:53:59.920 align:start position:0%
juvenile justice or child welfare
 
01:54:02.550 --> 01:54:02.560 align:start position:0%
but it does reflect the reality that the
 
01:54:03.750 --> 01:54:03.760 align:start position:0%
police encounter
 
01:54:06.950 --> 01:54:06.960 align:start position:0%
on the street every day so they actually
 
01:54:07.990 --> 01:54:08.000 align:start position:0%
may not even have a
 
01:54:10.709 --> 01:54:10.719 align:start position:0%
vision for what a child looks like when
 
01:54:11.510 --> 01:54:11.520 align:start position:0%
he or she
 
01:54:13.830 --> 01:54:13.840 align:start position:0%
and his family are being supported the
 
01:54:15.030 --> 01:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
way that they need to be
 
01:54:16.870 --> 01:54:16.880 align:start position:0%
so hopefully we're going to be able to
 
01:54:18.629 --> 01:54:18.639 align:start position:0%
transform a lot of that thinking
 
01:54:21.669 --> 01:54:21.679 align:start position:0%
as this plays out it's far more likely
 
01:54:23.750 --> 01:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
that a child will get back on track
 
01:54:26.229 --> 01:54:26.239 align:start position:0%
if their needs are identified and met
 
01:54:28.629 --> 01:54:28.639 align:start position:0%
and the family is supported in a way
 
01:54:30.229 --> 01:54:30.239 align:start position:0%
that they can grow strong and gain
 
01:54:32.070 --> 01:54:32.080 align:start position:0%
capacity to manage their family's
 
01:54:32.080 --> 01:54:33.109 align:start position:0%
capacity to manage their family's
challenges

01:54:33.109 --> 01:54:33.119 align:start position:0%
challenges
 
01:54:35.430 --> 01:54:35.440 align:start position:0%
so yesterday i had a conversation with a
 
01:54:37.910 --> 01:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
boy at the sununu youth services center
 
01:54:40.390 --> 01:54:40.400 align:start position:0%
who told me that what young people need
 
01:54:42.390 --> 01:54:42.400 align:start position:0%
if they're old enough is help getting a
 
01:54:42.400 --> 01:54:43.589 align:start position:0%
if they're old enough is help getting a
job

01:54:43.589 --> 01:54:43.599 align:start position:0%
job
 
01:54:45.510 --> 01:54:45.520 align:start position:0%
and then he said if they're not old
 
01:54:47.990 --> 01:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
enough it may be that their parents need
 
01:54:49.589 --> 01:54:49.599 align:start position:0%
help getting a job
 
01:54:51.589 --> 01:54:51.599 align:start position:0%
and it's wonderful when you propose a
 
01:54:53.589 --> 01:54:53.599 align:start position:0%
need for a policy that a child actually
 
01:54:54.709 --> 01:54:54.719 align:start position:0%
confirms for you
 
01:54:56.629 --> 01:54:56.639 align:start position:0%
and never underestimate how smart these
 
01:54:57.750 --> 01:54:57.760 align:start position:0%
kids are
 
01:55:00.550 --> 01:55:00.560 align:start position:0%
um so i suspect were he to undergo that
 
01:55:00.560 --> 01:55:01.510 align:start position:0%
um so i suspect were he to undergo that
assessment

01:55:01.510 --> 01:55:01.520 align:start position:0%
assessment
 
01:55:03.669 --> 01:55:03.679 align:start position:0%
that need in their family for employment
 
01:55:05.830 --> 01:55:05.840 align:start position:0%
for family economic stability would
 
01:55:07.350 --> 01:55:07.360 align:start position:0%
probably be identified and we could
 
01:55:08.790 --> 01:55:08.800 align:start position:0%
address it and he wouldn't be in the
 
01:55:11.669 --> 01:55:11.679 align:start position:0%
high end of the system where he is today
 
01:55:13.189 --> 01:55:13.199 align:start position:0%
so for those reasons i encourage you to
 
01:55:15.430 --> 01:55:15.440 align:start position:0%
support senate bill 94
 
01:55:16.950 --> 01:55:16.960 align:start position:0%
and i thank you very much for taking my
 
01:55:18.550 --> 01:55:18.560 align:start position:0%
testimony if you have questions i
 
01:55:20.470 --> 01:55:20.480 align:start position:0%
welcome them
 
01:55:24.149 --> 01:55:24.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:27.990 --> 01:55:28.000 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh miss o'neill
 
01:55:31.430 --> 01:55:31.440 align:start position:0%
um are you aware of any police training
 
01:55:32.470 --> 01:55:32.480 align:start position:0%
with reference
 
01:55:35.750 --> 01:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:38.950 --> 01:55:38.960 align:start position:0%
with reference to this bill well yeah
 
01:55:41.270 --> 01:55:41.280 align:start position:0%
well specifically the actions of this
 
01:55:41.280 --> 01:55:42.070 align:start position:0%
well specifically the actions of this
bill

01:55:42.070 --> 01:55:42.080 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:55:44.709 --> 01:55:44.719 align:start position:0%
yeah so i think that director ribson did
 
01:55:45.990 --> 01:55:46.000 align:start position:0%
explain that we
 
01:55:47.990 --> 01:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
that that's been part of the work that
 
01:55:49.270 --> 01:55:49.280 align:start position:0%
we're doing
 
01:55:51.510 --> 01:55:51.520 align:start position:0%
we've been having these gatherings um
 
01:55:52.870 --> 01:55:52.880 align:start position:0%
and we have some com
 
01:55:55.030 --> 01:55:55.040 align:start position:0%
i mean we have we've reached out to so
 
01:55:56.870 --> 01:55:56.880 align:start position:0%
far we've spoken to probably
 
01:55:59.430 --> 01:55:59.440 align:start position:0%
five or six hundred people on this issue
 
01:56:01.109 --> 01:56:01.119 align:start position:0%
many stakeholders many people who are
 
01:56:01.119 --> 01:56:02.149 align:start position:0%
many stakeholders many people who are
interested

01:56:02.149 --> 01:56:02.159 align:start position:0%
interested
 
01:56:04.390 --> 01:56:04.400 align:start position:0%
um and if you attended the affinity
 
01:56:05.750 --> 01:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
groups you know that we actually went
 
01:56:05.760 --> 01:56:06.629 align:start position:0%
groups you know that we actually went
into

already testified i'll let you if you
 
01:57:07.830 --> 01:57:07.840 align:start position:0%
wanted to add
 
01:57:09.830 --> 01:57:09.840 align:start position:0%
input to a question but i really don't
 
01:57:11.910 --> 01:57:11.920 align:start position:0%
want to get into debate back and forth
 
01:57:13.910 --> 01:57:13.920 align:start position:0%

chair

01:57:17.350 --> 01:57:17.360 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:57:19.109 --> 01:57:19.119 align:start position:0%
and i appreciate that i was um just
 
01:57:20.470 --> 01:57:20.480 align:start position:0%
wanted to loop back on
 
01:57:22.709 --> 01:57:22.719 align:start position:0%
representative long's question regarding
 
01:57:24.390 --> 01:57:24.400 align:start position:0%
the numbers if they were i did
 
01:57:27.030 --> 01:57:27.040 align:start position:0%
manage to find it and pull it up and
 
01:57:28.310 --> 01:57:28.320 align:start position:0%
really what it looks like
 
01:57:32.149 --> 01:57:32.159 align:start position:0%
is the the groupings are really to
 
01:57:33.589 --> 01:57:33.599 align:start position:0%
distribute them so
 
01:57:36.070 --> 01:57:36.080 align:start position:0%
they're not top heavy so that we have
 
01:57:37.750 --> 01:57:37.760 align:start position:0%
sort of an even distribution
 
01:57:39.750 --> 01:57:39.760 align:start position:0%
of cases among the circuits as it's
 
01:57:41.189 --> 01:57:41.199 align:start position:0%
being rolled out
 
01:57:43.669 --> 01:57:43.679 align:start position:0%
rather than just doing all light ones or
 
01:57:46.310 --> 01:57:46.320 align:start position:0%
all very heavy districts
 
01:57:48.709 --> 01:57:48.719 align:start position:0%
they're really balancing the numbers
 
01:57:50.470 --> 01:57:50.480 align:start position:0%
throughout the various districts so that
 
01:57:54.310 --> 01:57:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:56.790 --> 01:57:56.800 align:start position:0%
excellent thank you so much for that
 
01:57:57.990 --> 01:57:58.000 align:start position:0%

could it be sent to the entire committee
 
02:01:41.589 --> 02:01:41.599 align:start position:0%
i don't know if that
 
02:01:43.510 --> 02:01:43.520 align:start position:0%
that was what i was hoping she was going
 
02:01:46.070 --> 02:01:46.080 align:start position:0%
to do thank you
 
02:02:00.229 --> 02:02:00.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:03.350 --> 02:02:03.360 align:start position:0%
go madam chair yes yeah
 
02:02:06.629 --> 02:02:06.639 align:start position:0%
i don't i mean as far as you know as far
 
02:02:07.830 --> 02:02:07.840 align:start position:0%
as i'm concerned
 
02:02:10.390 --> 02:02:10.400 align:start position:0%
um i i already know where i am with this
 
02:02:10.400 --> 02:02:11.189 align:start position:0%
um i i already know where i am with this
bill

02:02:11.189 --> 02:02:11.199 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:02:14.870 --> 02:02:14.880 align:start position:0%
yeah and i i'm positive on it
 
02:02:18.149 --> 02:02:18.159 align:start position:0%
um you know i needed to know who so that
 
02:02:20.950 --> 02:02:20.960 align:start position:0%
afterwards i could call them i certainly
 
02:02:20.960 --> 02:02:21.830 align:start position:0%
afterwards i could call them i certainly
understand

02:02:21.830 --> 02:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
understand
 
02:02:25.350 --> 02:02:25.360 align:start position:0%
the uncertainty of opposition from law
 
02:02:25.360 --> 02:02:27.510 align:start position:0%
the uncertainty of opposition from law
enforcement

02:02:27.510 --> 02:02:27.520 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
02:02:30.229 --> 02:02:30.239 align:start position:0%
however with training or whatever i i
 
02:02:31.189 --> 02:02:31.199 align:start position:0%
don't think it's going to be
 
02:02:32.790 --> 02:02:32.800 align:start position:0%
an issue so i don't know if the
 
02:02:35.589 --> 02:02:35.599 align:start position:0%
committee needs that
 
02:02:38.870 --> 02:02:38.880 align:start position:0%
list prior to executing
 
02:02:41.030 --> 02:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
uh or i mean i just want to see whose
 
02:02:42.709 --> 02:02:42.719 align:start position:0%
names are on that so i'm going to give
 
02:02:45.030 --> 02:02:45.040 align:start position:0%
them a call after we exact
 
02:02:49.189 --> 02:02:49.199 align:start position:0%
uh to right right because
 
02:02:51.669 --> 02:02:51.679 align:start position:0%
i i think that it's again at the fear of
 
02:02:53.910 --> 02:02:53.920 align:start position:0%
the unknown maybe and the change
 
02:02:55.510 --> 02:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
which is something you know we have to
 
02:02:57.589 --> 02:02:57.599 align:start position:0%
get used to because clearly what
 
02:02:59.270 --> 02:02:59.280 align:start position:0%
was being done before really isn't
 
02:03:01.189 --> 02:03:01.199 align:start position:0%
working in the best interest of the kids
 
02:03:01.199 --> 02:03:02.149 align:start position:0%
working in the best interest of the kids
so

02:03:02.149 --> 02:03:02.159 align:start position:0%
so
