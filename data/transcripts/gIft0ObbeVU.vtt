347
00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:14.500
To the Committee of Conference on HB 542.

348
00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:20.500
My name is Representative McLean and I'll be chairing the Committee Conference.

349
00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:25.000
And so things are a little bit less formal.

350
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:47.500
We're not taking minutes and we're not taking the role, but what we will do, especially for those who may be watching remotely in the audience, I just go around the table and just ask everybody to introduce themselves and, you know, who they represent.

351
00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:49.500
represent.

352
00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:59.000
I'll start with myself, Mark McLean, representing Hillsborough District 44, which is Southern Manchester and the town of Litchfield.

353
00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:08.500
And I'm Representative Kurt Welker, I represent Stratford District 3, which is the towns of Stratford and New York.

354
00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:15.000
I'm Representative Joe Alexander, I represent Hillsborough District 6, the town of Gostown.

355
00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000
Mike Sylvia, Representative from Belmont, Belmont District 6.

356
00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.500
And I'm Senator Becky Whitley.

357
00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:29.000
I represent District 15, which is Concord and I put Connecticut Hopkins in the corner.

358
00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
All right.

359
00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.500
Thank you and welcome everybody.

360
00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:40.000
So, um, HB 542, an act relative to the protection of religious liberty.

361
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:50.000
So, the bill went over to the Senate, and the Senate did quite a little bit of work to it.

362
00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:58.500
And so, I thought we'd just kind of start off, since, unfortunately, you're the only senator here.

363
00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:04.000
Maybe you could kind of go through some of the changes.

364
00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:09.500
I see you did take out quite a bit of stuff.

365
00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:11.500
Sure.

366
00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:18.500
Maybe of walk us through that and some of the thinking, was it redundancy?

367
00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:20.500
Was it not needed?

368
00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:29.500
But just kind of some of the thought process as to why some of those things were all.

369
00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:31.500
Yeah.

370
00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:51.000
So the committee heard a lot of testimony, mostly about the first portion of the bill and heard that most notably from the attorney general's office that the broad definitions in the bill might have some unintended unintended consequences.

371
00:15:51.000 --> 00:16:14.500
So, you know, everyone fully recognized, of course, the importance of free exercise of religion and, you know, the importance of our religious communities, but felt like the language was so broad that it would just have these unintended consequences of having businesses being able to discriminate.

372
00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:23.000
So we had, you know, we have a current anti-discrimination law in New Hampshire, RSA 354A, right?

373
00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:32.000
And this currently exempts houses of worship and religiously affiliated organizations from compliance with the state's inter-discrimination law.

374
00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:49.500
But this bill, the portion that the Senate Judiciary Committee eliminated, the Senate eliminated, would take it further and extend that exemption to all individuals and businesses, regardless of whether they are religious or secular.

375
00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:59.000
So that's the portion that we had concerns with and heard significant testimony, including from the attorney general's office.

376
00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:04.000
That was why the decision from that portion was made.

377
00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:12.500
So that portion, you know, are you speaking about the definition section here where you took out.

378
00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:29.000
A person, for example, the Senate version I just i'm just looking at the side by side, so the Senate version, the definition is removed specifically were person and for state action so.

379
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.000
So specifically, let's just look at the person.

380
00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.500
Person means any individual association, partnership, corporation.

381
00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:42.500
So is that the part that they were saying was too broad?

382
00:17:42.500 --> 00:18:20.000
So looking at the bill as amended by the House, basically the full sections full um uh sections one two three were all removed so the remainder of the bill the protection of religious liberty is the one that that remained so those were all so those sections were all primarily uh the finding section so so all the findings were removed So I think, you know, for the most part, we're okay with that.

383
00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.500
It's getting into the definitions.

384
00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:31.500
So, and specifically you were saying where we think it's too broad and that it might apply to.

385
00:18:31.500 --> 00:19:08.000
So I'm just looking at the person as it exists in the house version says any individual association partnership corporation church or the institution etc or other legal entity um so that was legal counsel felt that that was too broad correct okay and what was it that they want tied more into an individual or because we we do define person and religious organization so but they left religious organization in there.

386
00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000
And they were okay with that.

387
00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:26.000
Yeah, so I will say that, you know, in when we voted on the entire house, you know, I was in the minority with the voting on the entire bill.

388
00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000
Okay.

389
00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:50.500
You know, I actually think that the definition for religious organization is also incredibly broad because it includes, you know, not just houses of worship, but religious schools and societies and businesses, you know, nearly anyone can claim to be organizing for a religious purpose.

390
00:19:50.500 --> 00:20:00.000
I think we're going to request a break if that's okay so we can wait for our Senate colleagues.

391
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000
Okay.

392
00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000
Thank you.

393
00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000
Thank you.

394
00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.000
Thank you.

395
00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000
Thank you.

396
00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000
Thank you.

397
00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000
Thank you.

398
00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.000
Senator Whitley was just went around.

399
00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.500
We did some quick introductions.

400
00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:22.500
Senator Whitley kind of went through.

401
00:20:22.500 --> 00:21:05.500
She had discussed the findings had been taken out and she also was up to the point talking about some of the definitions were removed specifically person and state action so she was just kind of going through some of the concerns with the definition of person and some of the consequences that that might bring so not everybody's back maybe we just kind of pick up we're just kind of going through the thing and just because you guys did take quite a bit out.

402
00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:11.000
I'm just trying to understand what were some of the concerns.

403
00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:21.000
OK, some of the initial concerns, the what we were really looking for was a very clear, very concise statement.

404
00:21:21.000 --> 00:22:11.000
And the front of the bill was loaded with purpose statements and we said okay we're not going to deal with this we wanted to make sure that religion and the ability to worship was considered to be an essential service that people needed to go to their church to be allowed to worship as they saw fit, because as we all know during COVID, how awful it was, how people were isolated, and people could receive solace from church, from going to church, listening to their ministers, being able to be with their fellow congregants, how important that was.

405
00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:29.000
And so we wanted to make sure that if we should ever go through anything like this again, religion would be considered essential to the well being of the people in the state of New Hampshire.

406
00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:34.500
So we got rid of all that stuff in the front.

407
00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:37.500
And that's what we concentrated on.

408
00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:43.000
So so and so that so we got to that part.

409
00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:56.500
Some of the definitions, person state action, she was discussing some of the consequences with applying personhood to the state's trusts, foundations, legal entities, all that stuff.

410
00:22:56.500 --> 00:23:00.500
So I'm assuming that was just taken out.

411
00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:05.000
So that would fall back on the common person.

412
00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:11.000
What we hold in common is this is what a person is.

413
00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:16.500
And state action, do you know why that was taken out?

414
00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:22.000
Did you feel that was addressed later on in the bill?

415
00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.500
But that definition was taken care of.

416
00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:28.500
What do you mean state action?

417
00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:33.500
Because I'm looking here at as amended by the House.

418
00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:40.000
So the yeah, as amended by the Senate, the definition of state action.

419
00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:45.500
So those two definitions were taken up person and state action.

420
00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:48.500
So page five, side by side.

421
00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:51.500
Oh, I'm looking at the middle.

422
00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:53.500
Okay.

423
00:23:53.500 --> 00:24:12.000
Yes, if you go down, if you guys have a side by side side and you go to page five, and if you look down to Rowland five on the house version, it just defined state action.

424
00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.500
It was removed in the Senate version.

425
00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:22.500
So we were just looking to, were you seeing other complications relative to that?

426
00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:39.000
To be quite honest with you, Representative, I believe that we got rid of that particular part because the ability for a person to worship in their church goes well beyond state action.

427
00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:52.500
And the state shouldn't be able to mandate when you're going to be able to go to church and how you're going to be able to church.

428
00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:57.000
That is under the Constitution, under freedom of religion.

429
00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:02.000
So the thinking was then that that definition was right.

430
00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:28.500
Well, there is provision in here that says that state government, it says, shall not enforce any health, safety, or occupancy requirement that imposes a substantial burden on a religious service unless the government demonstrates that the burden to the religious service in this particular instance is essential to further compelling government interests.

431
00:25:28.500 --> 00:26:11.000
So the state, if it had early on deemed religion as being essential and allowing and not even allowing, but they could have imposed the mask mandate or the six feet apart social distancing and ask the churches to do that okay i'm not understanding what what you just said senator because it seems to me that 546 on page 754 16 three state emergency protection roman one has been removed okay i'm looking here Okay, you're're gonna have to point that out to me.

432
00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.000
It's on page 16.

433
00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.000
It's on page 16.

434
00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.500
Okay, okay, I'm looking at.

435
00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:21.500
Right, that first section is gone, I believe.

436
00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:24.500
So 546 C is also out.

437
00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:27.500
But 546 C is also out.

438
00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:29.500
And so, right.

439
00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:31.500
Okay.

440
00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:41.000
The prohibitions that I see begin on page 7 in the Senate bill with Roman 1 notwithstanding RSA 445.

441
00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.000
Right.

442
00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:55.000
When you look at the state of emergency protections that I'm looking at set on page 7, it says shall not prohibit in-person gatherings.

443
00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:05.500
But the senate language says the state government shall permit a religious organization to continue to operate, engage in religious services.

444
00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:13.500
So I think they're the same thing, but they're just coming at it from different ways.

445
00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:17.000
The House version said shall not prohibit.

446
00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:21.500
And this side says shall permit a religious organization.

447
00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:26.000
So I think there's, they accomplished the same thing.

448
00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.000
You will follow up?

449
00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.000
I will prefer.

450
00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.500
Yeah, so I don't think I agree.

451
00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:36.500
And I guess it's two parts.

452
00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:42.500
So in 546, if we're just looking at the emergency protections, right?

453
00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:44.500
Mm-hmm.

454
00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:47.000
The intent of Roman one.

455
00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.000
Thank you.

456
00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:53.500
was to assure that in-person gatherings could be held.

457
00:27:53.500 --> 00:28:06.500
And when you say that you can't do it in any greater extent in other organizations or businesses, maybe that's the same thing, but maybe not.

458
00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:08.500
So...

459
00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:14.000
Well, it says shall permit religious organizations to continue to operate.

460
00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.500
Yes, and continue to operate.

461
00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:18.500
Shall rather than may.

462
00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:23.500
It says that they're required to allow them to continue.

463
00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:28.000
What we dealt with, Representative, was the term essential.

464
00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:39.500
I think that's one thing we've heard throughout this whole pandemic of COVID was these businesses, these entities, were considered to be essential.

465
00:28:39.500 --> 00:29:01.000
And we argued, in fact, I argued on the floor that my goodness, if Home Depot was considered to be essential, then the ability of a person to go to church and worship as they see fit should also be deemed as essential.

466
00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:05.000
And that our piece here speaks to that.

467
00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:38.500
If there are going to be differentiation between what's going to be open, what's going to be closed, who's going to be allowed to do this and who's going to be allowed to do that, this speaks that the state government shall permit a religious organization to continue operating and to engage in religious services to the same or greater extent that any other organization or business.

468
00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:43.000
So they're not going to be treated any differently.

469
00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:47.500
If all businesses are closed for whatever reason, okay.

470
00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:54.500
But if they're going to start picking and choosing, churches are right up there.

471
00:29:54.500 --> 00:30:07.000
So I suppose that the state in a state of emergency, the state has an emergency order that says there will be no in-person shopping.

472
00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:18.500
And if you want to go to the grocery store or you want to go to any other essential store or liquor stores.

473
00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:21.500
No, liquor stores were considered essential.

474
00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:23.500
I know.

475
00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:25.500
We had that testimony.

476
00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:35.500
If you want to go to the grocery store, you can do that, but you have to do curbside pickup.

477
00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:47.500
By this, that would mean the church could not have people together in their service because gatherings of people was prohibited to everybody else.

478
00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:50.000
I don't think so, Representative.

479
00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.000
I don't see that.

480
00:30:52.000 --> 00:31:10.000
What I'm saying is that the order could be issued that would prevent even two people from going into the same place, which would pretty much exclude any religious service, but it wouldn't explicitly do that.

481
00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:48.500
in the in the reading of a neutral way it would but it would it would i representative i don't read it that way um what i read it as saying that a religious organization the church is going to be treated like everyone else, that they are not going to be prohibited from allowing mass or whatever type of religious service that you go to, they're not gonna be able to say you can't do it.

482
00:31:48.500 --> 00:32:03.000
So in the existing state of emergency, the governor alluded to groups of people to attend, if I recall, who couldn't do it by saying it won't be yet?

483
00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:10.000
Well, I, along with Senator Guyton, sat on the Reopen New Hampshire Task Force.

484
00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:27.000
And so Senator Guyton worked very, very closely with a lot of the religious organizations in order for them to open, in order for them to be able to reach out to their congregants.

485
00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:37.000
And what I thought was interesting was that churches had some pretty ingenious ways of reaching out to their followers.

486
00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:41.000
They found a way to make it work.

487
00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:53.500
And so that is what this amendment really our amendment speaks to is that you've got to enable religious organizations to be able to meet.

488
00:32:53.500 --> 00:33:11.000
And it's important that we do so, that they would, they will always be considered to be an essential part of our society and will allow people to meet and to worship as they choose.

489
00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:25.000
So with that in mind, I mean, there may be situations like, let's say you have Ebola times 10, where it's so contagious that five minutes of contact.

490
00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:33.500
So, you know, the next three days, we've got to absolutely shut down and that means nothing.

491
00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:38.000
So that would be a very compelling state interest.

492
00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:54.500
So in that case, moving on just a little bit, C46, if you go to the side by side, the free exercise of religion protected portion, which again goes to the substantial burden.

493
00:33:54.500 --> 00:34:00.000
Yeah, sorry, page six on the left side of the house.

494
00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:05.000
Patrick O' So this gets into kind of detailing out.

495
00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:20.500
Patrick O' essential to furthering a compelling government interest might be a case, for example, where the governor would say no, you can't have any at all that might be Ebola.

496
00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:22.500
times 10 or whatever.

497
00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:33.000
So that kind of preserves, there might be a situation where that's absolutely necessary, and even math aren't going to work.

498
00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:43.000
But that language was taken out as well, which I think might have kind of covered that a little bit.

499
00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:47.000
So was there any thought as to why?

500
00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:53.500
I kind of think that lends something to it, that 546C, colon, 2.

501
00:34:53.500 --> 00:35:00.000
Well, as I said, we just focused on the state of emergency protections.

502
00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:05.000
We felt that that was the really compelling interest here.

503
00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:17.500
It was the real sense of dissatisfaction from so many people across the state that they were not allowed initially to worship in their churches.

504
00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:21.500
And that's what we focused our efforts on.

505
00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:35.500
So why couldn't we just keep one that said any power that's made to proceed to the state of emergency to not permit any person to have it?

506
00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:37.500
If in fact...

507
00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:40.000
Three, one hour or two.

508
00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:43.000
I'm right where it was before.

509
00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:57.000
If in fact, what you said, the way you're interpreting the only one of your bill means that, why is it so important that we don't say it?

510
00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:01.500
Because I think it's inherent in that first section.

511
00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:10.000
So we have two people here who disagree about whether or not it's inherent in that section.

512
00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:17.500
My question is why is it so important that the adults don't say it, right?

513
00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:27.000
In black and white, any power that's ready shall not go in person gatherings and establish houses of worship.

514
00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:33.000
because I think, and I believe it's Representative McClain, am I correct?

515
00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.000
Yes.

516
00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:53.500
Brought up the point of Ebola times 10, that there might be a situation where they're just going to say, look, we have to close everything down because this is so, I don't know, the Black Death.

517
00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:57.500
I don't know what you will call it.

518
00:36:57.500 --> 00:37:00.500
Something that is just so contagious.

519
00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:10.000
And for the health, the safety and welfare of the people of the state, we need to do this.

520
00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:15.500
We need to do it for a short period of time.

521
00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:30.500
And hopefully with the work that's being done on 4-17, that's going to get further defined and confined in as far as time, as to how long that can happen.

522
00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:40.500
But I would hope that we would never, ever, ever run into a situation where something like this would happen.

523
00:37:40.500 --> 00:38:00.000
Or what happens if a nuclear bomb was set up, a dirty bomb, or some other sort of extremely catastrophic event where, you know, the governor has to come out and say, listen, we're going to shut everything down.

524
00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:05.500
We have to, but we're going to let churches still go.

525
00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:10.500
I mean, that's where I think that there's a problem.

526
00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:29.000
Again, what we focused on was the fact that early on when decisions were being made about what was considered to be essential, religion and your ability to practice your religion was not considered to be essential.

527
00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:33.500
And the Senate by majority vote disagreed with that.

528
00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:45.500
That we felt that it was important that the ability for people to worship, to go to church, worship however they choose was preserved.

529
00:38:45.500 --> 00:39:04.500
But we also understand that there's hopefully not in my lifetime, not in your lifetime, not in anyone's lifetime, will we ever encounter a situation where everything has to shut down because of some sort of catastrophic event.

530
00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:09.500
So with that in mind, and that's a good point.

531
00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:36.500
So if we were to go back and leave that section then and to go back on to page six, which is the free exercise of religion protected, this is where the kind of making the case for furthering a compelling government interest such as you know Ebola times 10 or something like that.

532
00:39:36.500 --> 00:39:46.000
So what would your thoughts be about putting that section back in, or maybe a part of that section?

533
00:39:46.000 --> 00:40:13.000
I think that section 546 C2 Roman 1, I think is a good clarifying sentence um the uh roman 2 we might want to talk about because there's some other stuff further on when you're talking about qualifying um but i think i think roman one enrollment three may actually provide some some clarity.

534
00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:16.500
Do you have any thoughts on that?

535
00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:22.000
Well, I'd like to look at it a little more closely.

536
00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.000
Okay.

537
00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:37.000
Because I want to make this is again this is something that is extremely important, and I want to make sure that we get it right.

538
00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:39.000
Sure.

539
00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:44.000
And that we provide a very clear and concise statement.

540
00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:54.000
So we can consult with the Senate attorney to make sure that that language reflects exactly what we're looking for.

541
00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:58.500
Is there anything else in our version that you...

542
00:40:58.500 --> 00:41:09.500
Well, I think putting one and three and two might be problematic just because I don't understand if you go further on.

543
00:41:09.500 --> 00:41:15.000
You did take out the section on qualified immunity later on.

544
00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:24.000
And so I didn't know how enrollment to in that particular section, maybe interconnected with that later section.

545
00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:26.000
section.

546
00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:48.000
So, but just on that waving of immunity, I guess the concern that some folks had was if you go and you look on the Senate version on page eight, Roman three and Roman four, this is basically laying out what the remedy is.

547
00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:58.500
And so that's basically saying, if there's something that goes against the provisions of this law, this is where it is.

548
00:41:58.500 --> 00:42:01.000
And I think that's good.

549
00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:34.500
The concern some people had was if you look on the House version, where you've eliminated at the bottom of page 8 546 c colon four so the question is um does the elimination of that section take the teeth out of the senate version roman three and roman four no i don't believe so um If you think about immunity waves, who are you actually suing?

550
00:42:34.500 --> 00:42:38.500
Are you going to be suing the governor?

551
00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:42.500
Are you going to be suing the legislature?

552
00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:46.000
Who are you going to be suing?

553
00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:52.000
So I think we need to be very, very careful about that.

554
00:42:52.000 --> 00:43:27.000
I do think that our section here in three and four, Roman 3 and Roman 4, that they can assert a violation of this section as a claim against the state government in any judicial or administrative proceeding, or as a defense in any judicial or administrative proceeding, without regard to whether the proceeding is brought by or in the name of state government, any private person or other party.

555
00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:30.000
I think that that covers it.

556
00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:34.500
It still allows them to bring forward a claim.

557
00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:37.500
We don't have to waive immunity.

558
00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:47.500
And then finally, any religious organization that successfully inserts a claim may recover appropriate relief, including but not limited to.

559
00:43:47.500 --> 00:44:21.000
And it tells you inductive relief, declaratory relief, compensatory compensatory damages costs and attorney fees so i think that that's already addressed so we that's why we took that out also let's say this is role played for a little bit if i'm um a church and i'm a small church um and i've been kind of sidelined so i'm out six of collections, let's just say.

560
00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:30.500
So I do want to get some compensatory relief because I got to fix the roof on my church.

561
00:44:30.500 --> 00:44:35.000
So where would I pursue damages in that case?

562
00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:42.500
Say, you know, I want to, would those compensatory damages come from the state or?

563
00:44:42.500 --> 00:44:46.000
That would be up to the judge.

564
00:44:46.000 --> 00:45:17.000
That, I mean, we can't micromanage that yeah i mean you have every everybody has the right to file a suit and you would be able to file a suit in court and again you it says here you could uh injunctive relief you said you know six months without your collections yeah you could go before and ask for injunctive relief.

565
00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:20.000
You know, you're killing my church.

566
00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:22.500
I'm not getting any money.

567
00:45:22.500 --> 00:45:26.000
How long is this going to last?

568
00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:30.000
We need to be, we need relief here.

569
00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:35.000
Or declaratory relief, compensatory, compensatory, it's been a long day.

570
00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:38.000
Compensatory damages, costs, and attorney fees.

571
00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:44.000
So you would have the ability to sue for all of those.

572
00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:49.500
Did anybody else want to get a fine tip for Xanathonia?

573
00:45:49.500 --> 00:45:51.500
Thank you, Mr.

574
00:45:51.500 --> 00:45:53.500
Chair.

575
00:45:53.500 --> 00:45:58.500
I think the Senate's position is pretty clear on this.

576
00:45:58.500 --> 00:46:00.500
Just one question.

577
00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:05.000
The title, does that really need to be removed?

578
00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:07.000
What's the title removed?

579
00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:09.000
Or Was it renamed?

580
00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:11.000
The title.

581
00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:18.000
This act may be known and cited as the New Hampshire Religious Liberty Act.

582
00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:25.000
Yeah, we just took out that whole section of the protection of religious thing.

583
00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:30.000
If you're opposed to restoring the name of the bill.

584
00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:32.000
No.

585
00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:34.000
I'm okay with that.

586
00:46:34.000 --> 00:47:26.000
So the only thing I have is the 546 scene, colon two, that those sentences just to clarify what we talked about before what the page six, just section one if we can add that language in essential government interests I support me doing that I think and I understand how C colon 2 Roman 2 of that you know might be problematic given some of the other discussions that we've had but i think and you can talk to your council that one and three actually clarify and and may be a benefit um so i don't know how long you know that.

587
00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:28.000
We can.

588
00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:30.000
Right there.

589
00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:38.500
The room in the back, maybe we can go to the back and discuss this and okay.

590
00:47:38.500 --> 00:47:40.500
Mr Chairman.

591
00:47:40.500 --> 00:47:47.500
Yes, just one thing to note that that paragraph was attached to the definition.

592
00:47:47.500 --> 00:47:51.000
So we'll have to take a look.

593
00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:59.000
If you include the state action, the language on the state action, the state action definitions.

594
00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:02.500
Do you want to speak about it?

595
00:48:02.500 --> 00:48:04.500
But state action.

596
00:48:04.500 --> 00:48:06.500
Because state actions.

597
00:48:06.500 --> 00:48:08.500
OK.

598
00:48:08.500 --> 00:48:10.500
You're the same thing.

599
00:48:10.500 --> 00:48:12.500
You're taking out person.

600
00:48:12.500 --> 00:48:15.500
You took out person too, right?

601
00:48:15.500 --> 00:48:17.500
Yeah.

602
00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:19.500
that's okay.

603
00:48:19.500 --> 00:48:29.500
But you don't need those because what's in the bill is so different than common understanding of what state action.

604
00:48:29.500 --> 00:48:32.500
State action applies all its subsidiaries.

605
00:48:32.500 --> 00:48:34.500
That's right.

606
00:48:34.500 --> 00:48:38.000
And that was a question to represent.

607
00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:41.500
We'll go back and talk to Rick.

608
00:48:41.500 --> 00:48:44.000
Let's see what's going on.

609
00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:46.000
Gracias.

610
00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:48.000
Thank you.

611
00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:50.000
Thank you.

612
00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:52.000
Thank you.

613
00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:54.000
Thank you.

614
00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:56.000
Thank you.

615
00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:58.000
Thank you.

616
00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:00.000
Thank you.

617
00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:02.000
Thank you.

618
00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:04.000
.

619
00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:24.500
Those particular sections we had a lot of pushback on because it could have been construed as being discriminatory in that someone would be allowed to discriminate against another and use the argument that it was based on freedom of religion.

620
00:49:24.500 --> 00:49:27.500
And that's why we discarded that.

621
00:49:27.500 --> 00:49:36.000
And that was testimony that we had had from numerous organizations as well as the Attorney General.

622
00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:42.000
So that is why we so this was so this was good.

623
00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:44.000
The state action.

624
00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:56.000
Yes, that's why I took for the life of me I couldn't remember why we took down the Bible person unless the person was.

625
00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:58.000
Because.

626
00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:04.000
Because state action would also include, let's say, the Human Rights Commission.

627
00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:57.000
So if someone made a complaint to the human rights commission um they could bring action so for example if you is the thinking that say you're a catholic and obviously the catholic church doesn't ordain women so this is this kind of thing the fear was around something like that as the church is discriminating against me well it was um there were a number of issues of discrimination that had been brought up where people felt it was not very clear and so that's one reason that was the reason why we disregarded that um i the life of me, I couldn't remember why.

628
00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:04.500
Because just on the face of it, you're reading it, you're like, oh, yeah, okay.

629
00:51:04.500 --> 00:51:14.500
Isn't that, to me, this is just a state of religious groups in our country for a very long time.

630
00:51:14.500 --> 00:51:18.500
This is the standard that all of our...

631
00:51:18.500 --> 00:51:24.500
This is the intersection of the court, the legal system, and religion.

632
00:51:24.500 --> 00:51:29.500
Sometimes it doesn't really make a lot of sense, unfortunately.

633
00:51:29.500 --> 00:51:44.500
It can be construed in a lot of different ways, and that's why- I mean, to me, the interaction is no more right to substantially burden with religious freedom freedom.

634
00:51:44.500 --> 00:52:09.500
But if someone came forward and said, well, you know, I don't particularly like so-and-so because of their lifestyle, and my religion allows me to discriminate against that person, whether it's for a job, for housing, for any other reason, that would be in direct conflict with our anti-discrimination laws.

635
00:52:09.500 --> 00:52:26.000
If that could happen right now, you could just walk into court and say, if you're charged with a discrimination complaint, you could just walk into court right now and make that defense.

636
00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:41.000
But we felt that again that we just really wanted to focus on the what we felt was the real emergent issue here was about the emergency protections for religion.

637
00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:49.500
That's what we decided we wanted to focus on based on the testimony that we had received.

638
00:52:49.500 --> 00:52:58.000
So, Representative Sylvia, you had made a recommendation which was to add in Section 1 the title.

639
00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:14.500
Add Section 1 the title and section one title we're just gonna put the title back in yep so this this would go back um i think we're we're fine with that Okay.

640
00:53:14.500 --> 00:53:17.000
So, well, I'll go down.

641
00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:19.000
Okay.

642
00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:22.000
Nothing about this was easy peasy.

643
00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:24.000
I'll have you know.

644
00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:33.000
This was a very I think this was one of the longest hearings that we had on this.

645
00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:50.500
Yeah, no, we heard from people across the state, and that's why it was important that we came up with something that we felt that everyone could support because this was such an important issue.

646
00:53:50.500 --> 00:53:54.000
We've had over 15 people sign up.

647
00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:58.000
It was a lot for a Zoom meeting.

648
00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:00.500
It really, really, truly was.

649
00:54:00.500 --> 00:54:03.500
Anybody else had anything else in?

650
00:54:03.500 --> 00:54:06.500
No, just thank you very much.

651
00:54:06.500 --> 00:54:10.000
We've enjoyed working with all of you.

652
00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:12.000
Well, thank you.

653
00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:14.000
Thank you very much.

654
00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:16.000
It was a pleasure.

655
00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:24.500
And then with that, I will close the hearing on HB 542 and run down to OLX.

656
00:54:24.500 --> 00:54:26.500
Okay.

657
00:54:26.500 --> 00:54:28.500
Thank you.

658
00:54:28.500 --> 00:54:30.500
Thank you.

659
00:54:30.500 --> 00:54:32.500
Thank you.

660
00:54:32.500 --> 00:54:34.500
Thank you.

661

Thank you.

662

Thank you.

663

Thank you.

664
00:54:40.500 --> 00:54:42.500
Thank you.

665
00:54:42.500 --> 00:54:44.500

00:56:04.500 --> 00:56:07.500
Yeah, Senator, I think you're muted.

684
00:56:07.500 --> 00:56:09.500
Yeah, you're muted.

685
00:56:09.500 --> 00:56:11.500
We can't hear you.

686
00:56:11.500 --> 00:56:14.000
I don't show as muted.

687
00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:34.500
You may have headphones, maybe, plugged into your device, because it's's not on mute but we're not hearing you I don't have any headphones or anything plugged in can you guys hear me now I'm so glad we're done with this.

688
00:56:34.500 --> 00:56:36.500
Yeah, I know.

689
00:56:36.500 --> 00:56:39.500
I believe, can you hear us?

690
00:56:39.500 --> 00:56:41.500
I can hear you.

691
00:56:41.500 --> 00:56:45.000
Okay, we can't hear you at all.

692
00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:47.000
Okay.

693
00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:51.000
I know I had this problem last night.

694
00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:53.000
Ah.

695
00:56:53.000 --> 00:57:00.000
I was having this problem when I have to have my daughter with me.

696
00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:03.500
It's like one of those generational things.

697
00:57:03.500 --> 00:57:05.500
I just...

698
00:57:05.500 --> 00:57:10.000
The fourth problem I got is I did that.

699
00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:12.000
Oh.

700
00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:14.500
And eventually fixed my tissue.

701
00:57:14.500 --> 00:57:16.500
Right?

702
00:57:16.500 --> 00:57:21.000
And might come unplugged or maybe it's our speaker.

703
00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:23.000
And this is on.

704
00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:25.000
Is there?

705
00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:27.000
Sure.

706
00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:29.000
Oh, excuse me.

707
00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:31.000
Oh.

708
00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:33.000
Oh.

709
00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:35.000
Oh, my God.

710
00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:37.000
There we go.

711
00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:39.000
Yeah.

712
00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:42.000
Can we call the section here?

713
00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:44.000
Yeah.

714
00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:46.500
Can I turn it off?

715
00:57:46.500 --> 00:57:50.000
I turned it off on the speaker.

716
00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:53.500
Are you able to hear me now?

717
00:57:53.500 --> 00:58:01.000
He's left on Mars and he's trying to communicate with Earth and it's a disaster.

718
00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:04.500
I have to use some obscure language.

719
00:58:04.500 --> 00:58:07.500
This is only communicating with Portsmouth.

720
00:58:07.500 --> 00:58:10.000
It's not quite as easy.

721
00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:12.000
Hey Cam.

722
00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:16.500
Would it be possible to follow the tech team?

723
00:58:16.500 --> 00:58:20.000
I could our discussion we're going to.

724
00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:22.000
Yes, she's like, okay.

725
00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:35.000
So the house passed the house bill 108 and it had a specific provision with regard to non public sessions under the right to know law.

726
00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:41.000
And the Senate added a an amendment on to that one provision.

727
00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:45.500
it also added two additional provisions to the bill.

728
00:58:45.500 --> 00:58:59.000
And I think probably the best way to address it or begin is to have the Senate explain what its intent was in adding those two provisions.

729
00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:01.000
The last two provisions?

730
00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:03.000
The last two provisions.

731
00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:05.000
Okay.

732
00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:10.500
The last two provisions, which was, one was Senate Bill 95.

733
00:59:10.500 --> 00:59:22.000
We added it because it was something that passed, language that passed in the Senate, but unfortunately the House, ITL did, I believe.

734
00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:39.500
And we felt that it had merit, so we wanted to be able to go to a committee of conference so we could have a fuller, more robust discussion between the House and the Senate.

735
00:59:39.500 --> 00:59:58.500
The second provision that was passed, which is on page four, beginning on line one, number 12, records protected under the attorney client privilege of attorney attorney work product doctrine that again was an amendment that we adopted.

736
00:59:58.500 --> 01:00:09.500
JoAnne Hanrahan- unanimously in the Senate in the Community and on the floor, and that is in regards to the Hampstead decision.

737
01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:34.500
There was a lot of consternation across the legal community with that decision, and they felt that additional protections needed to be in place so that their work and their work product, which had traditionally been left out of 91A, was going to now continue to be exempt from 91A.

738
01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:49.500
A few of the commissioners got together with the Attorney General's Office, and this was the language that the Attorney General's Office felt would have been appropriate to protect that.

739
01:00:49.500 --> 01:00:52.000
And so we adopted that.

740
01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
Questions from the committee?

741
01:00:54.000 --> 01:01:12.500
So if the Board of Automated Manchester is meeting and they decide to go into non-public to just discuss some things with their lawyer, that would still be privileged, but it would still go on the list.

742
01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:14.500
It would still be.

743
01:01:14.500 --> 01:01:16.500
Yes.

744
01:01:16.500 --> 01:01:23.000
Well, we felt we expanded it a little bit and made it clearer.

745
01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:48.000
And again, it says for all meetings held in non-public sessions where the minutes or decisions were determined to not be subject to full public disclosure, a list of such minutes and decisions shall be kept, and this list should be made available as soon as practicable for public disclosure.

746
01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:55.000
Because the testimony that we had was that oftentimes they close these public hearings.

747
01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
We agree on that.

748
01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
Oh, you do?

749
01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
Okay.

750
01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
That's the same way.

751
01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:15.000
The only thing you changed in that section was we had the word promptly, and you put in the phrase, as soon as practical.

752
01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
Right.

753
01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:20.500
And that's just because, okay, okay, good.

754
01:02:20.500 --> 01:02:23.000
I'm so prepared to explore.

755
01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:27.500
I don't want to waste my time on that.

756
01:02:27.500 --> 01:02:30.500
There are arguments to do here.

757
01:02:30.500 --> 01:02:32.500
Yeah.

758
01:02:32.500 --> 01:02:34.500
We're fine with that.

759
01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:36.500
Okay.

760
01:02:36.500 --> 01:02:47.500
I think the issue for me is the part two that you added, and that is with regard to continuing the remote.

761
01:02:47.500 --> 01:02:49.500
remotely.

762
01:02:49.500 --> 01:03:14.000
And I think the House has clearly taken a position in that regard on a couple of occasions, actually, and indicated that it did not want to continue the meetings, at least not in the manner in which they were currently being held, pursuant to the governor's executive orders.

763
01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:27.500
And for some fairly obvious reasons, one of the things that is included in there is that a physical location is not even required for the meeting.

764
01:03:27.500 --> 01:03:41.500
And there are many people in this state that do not have the technology to be able to participate in a meeting that doesn't have a physical location.

765
01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:50.500
And we didn't feel that that was appropriate to basically disenfranchise a part of the New Hampshire population.

766
01:03:50.500 --> 01:04:03.000
I believe that Senate Bill 95, as it was amended, actually addressed that because there was a requirement that there be at least a telephone.

767
01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:15.000
And I was and I would be interested to hearing from the House as to why you didn't think that we should continue it.

768
01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:20.500
I mean, from what I read, you wanted to study further.

769
01:04:20.500 --> 01:04:28.000
And, you know, I'm looking at it, we've just had 15 months of studying it.

770
01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:38.000
And, you know, from being on the on the board of select from the Milford, we've had to make adjustments.

771
01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:53.000
Now and then we have the equipment that we can set up and let people join our meeting via Zoom before they watched from cable TV and they couldn't participate.

772
01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:58.500
Going forward, even when we're back together, we've got the equipment.

773
01:04:58.500 --> 01:05:47.000
We know that participation increases because we've gone from about two to three people that show up for a physical meeting to 35 to 45 on a selectman meeting and up to 150 on the school board uh at your hearing you had 102 people that supported that bill and two that opposed we went back and we tried we worked with the nhma to try to address those various various things so we made it we made it so that there was not a requirement that you had to have any kind of video type thing.

774
01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:57.500
The only requirement was that if you were going to have a virtual meeting, then you had to have a telephone.

775
01:05:57.500 --> 01:06:01.000
So somebody could call in via conference.

776
01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:10.000
We know that not everybody had cameras and things like that, but pretty much everybody has a telephone.

777
01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:29.000
they can go down in person and and sit because i mean there is a location uh that be at the board of slackman or room or something like that that uh someone would be able to go.

778
01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:33.500
So if you took out the physical vocation requirements.

779
01:06:33.500 --> 01:06:39.500
Could you help me work through something that I'm having trouble with?

780
01:06:39.500 --> 01:06:57.500
And that is the difference between the members of a public body and the public so that I know in Durham, the numbers of participation have increased exponentially in planning board, zoning, town council, all that.

781
01:06:57.500 --> 01:07:02.500
And I believe that's been replicated all across the state.

782
01:07:02.500 --> 01:07:11.000
And I think that that is the best thing we can do in a democratic small society.

783
01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:36.500
Is there a way, and am I missing something quite obvious, to differentiate between the location of the official meeting and where there would have to be at least a quorum present of the members on that board body and everybody else, everyone in addition to a quorum and the public.

784
01:07:36.500 --> 01:07:42.500
Am I saying that, Senator, in a way that makes any sense?

785
01:07:42.500 --> 01:07:46.000
I think I know what you're saying.

786
01:07:46.000 --> 01:08:10.500
If you have five people in five different locations, you need one designated location where if somebody doesn't have a TV or doesn't have a phone, that they would be able to go and maybe watch what's going on, whether it's someplace that has a screen, something like that.

787
01:08:10.500 --> 01:08:14.000
And it may be a select one.

788
01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
If you're allowing center.

789
01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
Yes.

790
01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:22.500
I don't think that's where Representative Smith is going.

791
01:08:22.500 --> 01:08:24.500
Okay.

792
01:08:24.500 --> 01:08:27.500
She's trying to draw a distinction.

793
01:08:27.500 --> 01:08:36.000
Right now, the right to know like that does says nothing about how boards allow public participation.

794
01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:39.000
They just have to do it.

795
01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:42.000
They can do anything they want.

796
01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:45.000
They talk to how they meet.

797
01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:51.500
And it says they have to be in person except in an emergency.

798
01:08:51.500 --> 01:08:53.500
This bill said no.

799
01:08:53.500 --> 01:08:56.500
And that's the big overthrow here.

800
01:08:56.500 --> 01:09:07.500
It's not the participation, everybody agrees to that and there's nothing standing between the public and that ability to participate right now.

801
01:09:07.500 --> 01:09:15.000
Question is, does the board need to have an actual meeting or is it virtual?

802
01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:25.500
Do the select board, do the school board, do the planning board, do they have to actually come together to meet?

803
01:09:25.500 --> 01:09:43.000
That's the only question that we have and one of the things that I said when we were executing this bill is that emergency provision was put in the law long before I got there.

804
01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:48.000
I think it's a serious thing for us to contemplate.

805
01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:55.500
It's just a reason why people meet in person, witness what we're doing right here.

806
01:09:55.500 --> 01:09:57.500
OK.

807
01:09:57.500 --> 01:10:02.000
And I think Representative Smith's point is well taken.

808
01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:12.500
There's a distinction between the public participation and the active participation of the members of whatever governmental unit might use this.

809
01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:18.500
And I think that's where our discussion has gone in the past.

810
01:10:18.500 --> 01:10:26.000
And that is, I think I agree with everybody in terms of the public participation.

811
01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:30.500
We should have as much public participation as possible.

812
01:10:30.500 --> 01:10:32.500
We should continue that.

813
01:10:32.500 --> 01:10:37.000
But there's nothing that precludes that from doing technology.

814
01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:44.000
It's the question of whether or not you want remote participation by board members.

815
01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:55.000
And that gets into issues with regard to right to know and people's ability to observe and their governmental units doing business.

816
01:10:55.000 --> 01:11:21.000
And I'm speaking now as an individual and clearly without agreement in advance from my colleagues from the House, but I'm wondering if we could find a middle ground here in which we say that for those who serve on a body, there would have to be quarm present at one location.

817
01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:24.500
Justice, we have one senator not here.

818
01:11:24.500 --> 01:11:33.500
I mean, we could have, you know, in the planning board, the zoning board, whatever, in local government.

819
01:11:33.500 --> 01:11:40.500
They'd have to be a quorum present, but not everyone would have to be..

820
01:11:40.500 --> 01:11:47.000
Other members of the board could be virtual, which gives some flexibility there.

821
01:11:47.000 --> 01:12:33.500
And then that there must be everything that we've done so far to be able to have the public observe, but at least there'd be a clear home base whether it's in town hall or in the library or this there's a there's a home base for each meeting not a hundred percent attendance required in person for the people who are on the body and as I think an acknowledgement of what we've learned in the last 15 months, that it can work and that we can conduct public business this way.

822
01:12:33.500 --> 01:12:51.000
And then also along with that, everything that we can do to encourage not only the ability of the public to observe, but the ability of the public to participate because they can be recognized.

823
01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
They can ask questions.

824
01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:59.000
They can give a speech in the appropriate time in the agenda.

825
01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:16.500
And that is very different from what we've had in the past where people could turn on their televisions and from one system or another observe what the public body is doing, but couldn't participate.

826
01:13:16.500 --> 01:13:25.000
And I think the participation is a fair or the opportunity for participation is very, very important.

827
01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:43.500
And I would hope that I could convince my House colleagues that there was a way to provide some middle ground between what the Senate has in terms of 95 and what we know the public values.

828
01:13:43.500 --> 01:13:59.500
So would you be willing to go to a compromise to a requirement that at least two members of the board have to be in one location as opposed to a majority.

829
01:13:59.500 --> 01:14:02.000
As opposed to a bar?

830
01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:28.000
I don't think so and the thing and uh I think Representative Smith is on to something and I think that's a direction that we might want to go but I'm just not sure we can get that done in the seven minutes we have left to on our committee of conference.

831
01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
Yeo, little faith.

832
01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:41.000
And so my, and in fact, it was the Senate that proposed in Senate Bill 95 that there'd be a study committee.

833
01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:45.000
Well, we did that actually as a compromise.

834
01:14:45.000 --> 01:15:04.000
Yeah, well, I mean, after hearing from the House, if there was a study and so on and said, okay, in real life, we've lived through this, we are studying it and making changes as we go along.

835
01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:20.500
But by adding the study committee on for, you know, three, four months, then you get that feedback so that coming into the next year, you have that ability to make further tweaks.

836
01:15:20.500 --> 01:15:27.500
I mean, from my perspective, either we believe in local control or we don't.

837
01:15:27.500 --> 01:15:37.500
I'm not really sure why we at the state level feel that we need to control the local governing boards.

838
01:15:37.500 --> 01:15:42.000
No, we don't have local control in this state.

839
01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
We know it.

840
01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
Well, we don't.

841
01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:55.500
I mean, state has to give the local community any less of things that they state, we know it.

842
01:15:55.500 --> 01:15:57.500
We don't.

843
01:15:57.500 --> 01:16:08.000
I mean, the state has to give the local community how to do any blessed thing that they want to do.

844
01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:22.500
I would propose this, part one of the bill, which we sent over to you to begin with, and with your amendment, I think it's fine from my perspective.

845
01:16:22.500 --> 01:16:31.500
The last part with regard to the attorney client privilege, making that an exemption, makes sense Thank you.

846
01:16:31.500 --> 01:16:33.500
my perspective.

847
01:16:33.500 --> 01:16:45.500
The last part with regard to the attorney-client privilege, making that an exemption makes sense, and I think we could probably agree to that.

848
01:16:45.500 --> 01:16:55.000
The middle piece, I have to say that we killed 95 in our last session, including the study committee.

849
01:16:55.000 --> 01:17:19.500
What I think we might be able to do is take out what you have here for your second piece and replace it with the study committee again to put that in place so that we could look at that and look at what Representative Smith was talking about.

850
01:17:19.500 --> 01:18:38.500
I think we all on this side agreed that there is value, but we want to make sure that it's right and what venue does it work, what venue does it not work, as you mentioned, the Hillsborough County delegation is a shamble still i mean it's just too many people so we could change the hillsborough delegation we think that we think that there's value in studying it so that we we have a solid product but we really feel that if we don't have a break if we just allow what you're saying let's just keep it going then inertia is going to shape that final product as opposed to having that break so that we're looking at all the good all the bad and crafting a solid product and not allowing inertia to influence what that final product would be so i think that we would be more than welcome to look for the study.

851
01:18:38.500 --> 01:18:43.000
I don't know if you guys can hear me.

852
01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:46.000
Well, that was a nice cheer.

853
01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:50.000
I so appreciate everything that's been said today.

854
01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:55.000
And for the record, Senator Rebecca Perkins-Kuoka from District 21.

855
01:18:55.000 --> 01:19:00.500
And I do appreciate the spirit in which it's being offered.

856
01:19:00.500 --> 01:19:17.500
I do just want to make the additional point, just as a counterpoint to what was just said, Representative, that I think our municipalities, they have their operations set up under the current structure.

857
01:19:17.500 --> 01:19:54.500
And so out of consideration for what they're doing in their ongoing operations and us supporting them and doing their job as easily as possible, there's also logic in allowing that operation to continue and let them do what they've been doing to the extent that it's convenient or in a compromise with one or two members present and study it, you know, and allow us to make those changes going into next year.

858
01:19:54.500 --> 01:19:58.000
So I completely hear all your concerns.

859
01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:10.000
I just wanted to also raise that additional point since I know they're discussing now how to meet in June and July, you know.

860
01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:16.500
Because I believe with the expiration of the emergency orders, it's gone away.

861
01:20:16.500 --> 01:20:19.000
I mean, we're basically back.

862
01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:22.500
I happen to meet in person now.

863
01:20:22.500 --> 01:20:50.500
I mean, I guess one question I have that has come out of this, and I don't know the answer to, if I as chair of the board said, you know, I will be down at town hall for the meeting, and I had four people call in with extenuating circumstances why they couldn't be there.

864
01:20:50.500 --> 01:20:52.500
Is that allowed?

865
01:20:52.500 --> 01:20:56.500
Or would I have to cancel the meeting?

866
01:20:56.500 --> 01:21:02.500
Because the law allows people to be absent or come in via...

867
01:21:02.500 --> 01:21:06.500
We were in the same problem with the...

868
01:21:06.500 --> 01:21:44.500
we're coming up now uh the kind of delegation at hillsborough is going to be shortly we run into this problem all the time getting people physically present for a quorum and we're calling people um so it is a problem but yeah we have had to suspend meetings and reconvene for just that reason but i will say there is a difference between trying to get together 150 people versus five for a board meeting.

869
01:21:44.500 --> 01:22:36.500
But doesn't that make the case, Mark and Kurt, as to why we should keep things going as they are while we study, rather than stop study and then have to start again because it's the same principle of physics and inertia you know a moving body you know keeps on moving a stop body is much harder to start again and i think if we could keep if we could consider this as an interim period where we keep things as they are while we study them and then change, but instead of stop, start, stop, start, which is what you're proposing, Mark.

870
01:22:36.500 --> 01:22:38.500
And I understand that.

871
01:22:38.500 --> 01:22:42.000
I mean, you're a scientist, I'm not.

872
01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:51.000
I don't want to allow a short-term inconvenience, which this will be, to short circuit our long-term goals.

873
01:22:51.000 --> 01:23:02.500
And we've had this problem at the county delegation and bodies all over the state have had this problem for a long time.

874
01:23:02.500 --> 01:23:45.000
This is not a new problem so we're going to have we're going to have a break and will it be inconvenient yes but the goal is what is going to be our end product is it necessary is it necessary that is my question you know my my concern and i've used some people amazon so amazon comes in and it's so more convenient, but you don't understand where Amazon is ultimately going to take you and how it's going to alter the landscape.

875
01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:48.500
So I would say, is it necessary?

876
01:23:48.500 --> 01:23:58.000
Maybe it is, because I don't know that we fully understand where we're going to be in the future.

877
01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:05.000
How do you understand or determine what isn't working if you shut it down?

878
01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:09.000
You don't need to shut down public participation.

879
01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:24.500
I think that's the issue is you say, well, we're going to change this and go back the the way we were if people organizations allowing public participation there's no reason.

880
01:24:24.500 --> 01:24:36.000
John Lundberg, continue to allow public participation to through technology, the question is for board members should board members be present at me.

881
01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:45.000
and that may be some convenience for a board member, but basically you take the job with that.

882
01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:49.500
And that's the some convenience for a board member.

883
01:24:49.500 --> 01:24:53.500
But basically, you take the job with that.

884
01:24:53.500 --> 01:24:59.500
And that's the way it was a year and a half ago.

885
01:24:59.500 --> 01:25:03.000
I mean, you had to be there.

886
01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:29.000
That's why when we, because we amended Senegal's on 95 and Senator Daniels and I had some pretty good conversations and we had agreed that we would allow the meetings to continue, that we would put together the study committee and the study committee would have to issue a report in November.

887
01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:42.000
So that legislation could be filed reflecting the findings of that study committee, but leave things the way that they are until June of next year.

888
01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:51.000
And that way, any potential legislation would get, would work its way through the House and the Senate.

889
01:25:51.000 --> 01:26:03.000
And the ability to do that the way that they're doing it right now would end, I think it was June 30th of 2022.

890
01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:16.000
So that way, you're not going to get the stock from the start, you're going to get this continuance, you're going to get the study committee.

891
01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:27.000
You're going to get legislation filed, go through the House and the Senate, not as an omnibus bill, as a standalone bill.

892
01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000
No more omnibus bills.

893
01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:33.500
And then there would be some sort of disposition.

894
01:26:33.500 --> 01:26:43.500
No matter what happens at the end of June of 2022, the way that it's being done now is over.

895
01:26:43.500 --> 01:26:45.500
It's done.

896
01:26:45.500 --> 01:26:49.000
So something is going to replace it.

897
01:26:49.000 --> 01:27:08.500
Either you're going to go back to the old way of the requirement of, you know, you've got a board of five, all five members have to be there, or you're going to have some sort of a hybrid.

898
01:27:08.500 --> 01:27:12.500
And what is that going to look like?

899
01:27:12.500 --> 01:27:17.500
Because I really think we need to do the study.

900
01:27:17.500 --> 01:27:24.000
We need to look at this and say, what did we do right?

901
01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.500
What did we do wrong?

902
01:27:26.500 --> 01:27:34.000
And I just think it's very important that we at least, at least do that.

903
01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:38.500
So that was the thinking behind Senate Bill 95.

904
01:27:38.500 --> 01:27:46.000
So I think we might, and I know, but I think that's what we're offering.

905
01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:52.500
It's a compromise here rather than just trying to delete the second card.

906
01:27:52.500 --> 01:27:54.500
Senator Nantles?

907
01:27:54.500 --> 01:27:56.500
I don't know.

908
01:27:56.500 --> 01:28:05.000
I'm frustrated because I think we're taking three steps back and we're doing a disservice to people.

909
01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:11.500
I mean, they've gotten used to doing things over the last 14 months.

910
01:28:11.500 --> 01:28:17.500
I don't know that anyone could say that it hasn't been successful.

911
01:28:17.500 --> 01:28:20.000
We've seen that with participation.

912
01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:23.500
We've seen it with the board members.

913
01:28:23.500 --> 01:28:33.000
And my board, there's at least three of us who feel we like to be down at town hall.

914
01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:39.500
There are a couple others that were more concerned about the COVID stuff.

915
01:28:39.500 --> 01:28:43.000
They wanted to do things via Zoom.

916
01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:53.500
But I mean, I don't know why we can't allow the boards to function as they feel is the best way.

917
01:28:53.500 --> 01:29:20.500
If they start getting yelled at by the local residents who want to see the board in public, or even to say that, let this go until the next meeting, and then have the local public decide whether they want the board to continue with the old way or do things the new way.

918
01:29:20.500 --> 01:29:25.000
I mean, so, I mean, there's another compromise there.

919
01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:35.000
It's just let this go to the next annual meetings in March and let the public decide how they want.

920
01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.500
We need to wrap up.

921
01:29:37.500 --> 01:29:41.000
We do agree to what we do.

922
01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
Thank you.

923
01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
Oh, they won't.

924
01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.500
We need to wrap up.

925
01:29:47.500 --> 01:29:49.500
Mr.

926
01:29:49.500 --> 01:29:54.000
Chair, could you clarify exactly what your proposal is?

927
01:29:54.000 --> 01:30:00.000
It was to go with part one as amended by the Senate.

928
01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:13.000
Part two, which was continuing meetings as they are currently held under the executive orders that be replaced with the study committee, which was in 95.

929
01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:19.500
And part, and that's part two and part three, I think it is.

930
01:30:19.500 --> 01:30:26.500
And part four, which is the right to know, we would agree with that.

931
01:30:26.500 --> 01:30:29.500
Do you have that, Senator Perkins-Colpac?

932
01:30:29.500 --> 01:30:32.000
I understand what's being proposed.

933
01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
Yes, thank you.

934
01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:37.500
And that is that with the U.A.G.s?

935
01:30:37.500 --> 01:30:39.500
Yes, that's Adriana signage.

936
01:30:39.500 --> 01:30:41.500
The second part four.

937
01:30:41.500 --> 01:30:43.500
Yep.

938
01:30:43.500 --> 01:30:46.500
And the effective dates as appropriate.

939
01:30:46.500 --> 01:30:48.500
Yes.

940
01:30:48.500 --> 01:30:58.000
um this study is better than nothing i'm not sure Senator Daniels has expressed all of my emotions exactly.

941
01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:03.500
Okay, so it looks like we do have a relevant compromise.

942
01:31:03.500 --> 01:31:05.500
Okay.

943
01:31:05.500 --> 01:31:07.500
Thank you very much.

944
01:31:07.500 --> 01:31:12.000
I wish I could have voted with the Senate.

945
01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
I don't want to.

946
01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
Oh, come on.

947
01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000
You did fun.

948
01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000
Oh, oh, never.

949
01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000
Okay.

950
01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000
Thank you, Gary.

951
01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.000
Senator.

952
01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000
Thank you, everyone.

953
01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.000
Thank you, Senator.

954
01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000
Good to see you.

955
01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:38.500
I thought we had a good cover, otherwise I'm going to be fine.

956
01:31:38.500 --> 01:31:40.500
Thank you.

957
01:31:40.500 --> 01:31:42.500
Thank you.

958
01:31:42.500 --> 01:31:44.500
Thank you.

959
01:31:44.500 --> 01:31:46.500
I'm House Bill 566.

960
01:31:46.500 --> 01:31:49.000
My name is Ned Gordon.

961
01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:55.000
I work as a conferee for the House to chair the committee.

962
01:31:55.000 --> 01:32:02.000
And I represent Grafton County District 9, 5s, Alexandria, Bridgewater, Bristol, Ashland, and Grafton.

963
01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:05.500
And if anyone else would introduce themselves.

964
01:32:05.500 --> 01:32:13.500
I'm Representative Kurt Walfer, I represent Stratford District 3, the town of Stratford and New Durham.

965
01:32:13.500 --> 01:32:19.000
Mark McLean, Hillsborough District 44, which is Southern Manchester and Richmond.

966
01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:28.000
Senator Sharon Carson, I represent London, I represent District 14, comprising of townships, Auburn, London, Derry, and Hudson.

967
01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:42.500
I'm Senator Bill Gannon, I represent the Great District 23, it is the wine country of New Hampshire, in case you ever want to visit, I'll show you around.

968
01:32:42.500 --> 01:32:46.500
Sandown, Thienville, Bremont, Kingston, East Kingston, Bratwood, Exeter.

969
01:32:46.500 --> 01:32:49.000
I know I forgot someone.

970
01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.500
I'll be in big trouble.

971
01:32:51.500 --> 01:32:54.000
I'd like to promote our...

972
01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:57.000
I thought it was sunny sandown.

973
01:32:57.000 --> 01:33:02.000
Sunny sandown in the heart of New Hampshire wine country.

974
01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000
We missed a part.

975
01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:07.000
His colleague stepped in for it.

976
01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:15.000
And I live on Phillips Pond, named after King Phillips, the famous Indian king, from sandown.

977
01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
That's tough to follow.

978
01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
Thank you everyone.

979
01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:26.000
And I think everybody has a comparison between the two versions of the bill.

980
01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:36.000
The bill passed by the House, which dealt specifically with no issues and what was eventually passed by the Senate.

981
01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:41.000
I note that part one of the bill is identical.

982
01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:45.000
Both parties made agreements in regard to that.

983
01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:51.500
Part two of the bill seems to have been deleted by the Senate.

984
01:33:51.500 --> 01:34:00.500
And then there were a number of parts that were added, which constitute what was sent until 143.

985
01:34:00.500 --> 01:34:02.500
And Mr.

986
01:34:02.500 --> 01:34:06.500
Chairman, we're going to recede from that position.

987
01:34:06.500 --> 01:34:13.500
Although Senator Whitley brought up something that we neglected to talk about this morning.

988
01:34:13.500 --> 01:34:19.000
There was a request from the Department of Corrections Municipal Association.

989
01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.500
Was it the Municipal Association?

990
01:34:21.500 --> 01:34:26.000
I thought it was from the Department of Corrections.

991
01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:29.500
Well, what was the department of corrections?

992
01:34:29.500 --> 01:34:31.500
Municipal Association.

993
01:34:31.500 --> 01:34:34.000
Was it the Municipal Association?

994
01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:38.500
I thought it was from the department of corrections.

995
01:34:38.500 --> 01:34:40.500
What was the request?

996
01:34:40.500 --> 01:34:47.000
There was some language that they had requested to eliminate any unintended consequences.

997
01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:53.500
I can either read the email or read the language that Johnson said.

998
01:34:53.500 --> 01:35:08.000
I thought because I got that same email from Miss Burns, and I thought that we had taken care of that in an amendment in the in our discussions.

999
01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:12.000
So that's why I didn't bring it forward.

1000
01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:21.000
Oh, I'm pretty sure we took care of that as you suggested, or as Margaret suggested that one.

1001
01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.500
to get that music yet.

1002
01:35:23.500 --> 01:35:37.500
Could you point that clarification out because i left my um senate bill 143 downstairs just exactly where it is Oh, we didn't even deal with the cybersecurity.

1003
01:35:37.500 --> 01:35:44.500
We understood why they took it out, so we didn't do anything with it.

1004
01:35:44.500 --> 01:35:46.500
We left it out.

1005
01:35:46.500 --> 01:35:54.000
So because it was left out there was no reason to bring that language forward.

1006
01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000
So we're good.

1007
01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000
So we've done right.

1008
01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:06.000
So well how about so part two it appears that you may have deleted part two.

1009
01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:14.000
Part two we deleted because we focused on House Bill 108 and 108 covers that section.

1010
01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:22.500
And that's why we said we need to get 156 with just the first part of that.

1011
01:36:22.500 --> 01:36:27.000
And it will work together with House Bill 108.

1012
01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:35.000
So in acceding to the position, you're acceding to just paragraph part one of the bill.

1013
01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:38.000
Yeah, we're just not part two.

1014
01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000
Right.

1015
01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000
Everything else is gone.

1016
01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000
Oh, so.

1017
01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
Many members.

1018
01:36:46.000 --> 01:37:00.500
to the discussion on public session in the 10th subparagraph to show the data available to the public and send us a practical yeah and after the transaction Yeah.

1019
01:37:00.500 --> 01:37:09.000
And That's where we got the language that we sent to you is in one way now.

1020
01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000
Yes.

1021
01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000
Yes.

1022
01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000
Okay.

1023
01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000
So that's right.

1024
01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000
That was literally.

1025
01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000
Yep.

1026
01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000
That was the language.

1027
01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
Except for that.

1028
01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
So, so, no one.

1029
01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000
That's right.

1030
01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.500
We already discussed that one.

1031
01:37:31.500 --> 01:37:34.500
Yeah, there it is right there.

1032
01:37:34.500 --> 01:37:36.500
Yeah.

1033
01:37:36.500 --> 01:37:40.500
We still have our one away from them.

1034
01:37:40.500 --> 01:37:42.500
Yeah.

1035
01:37:42.500 --> 01:37:44.500
So, that's right.

1036
01:37:44.500 --> 01:37:48.000
I just compared it work for word.

1037
01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:55.500
And the only difference was we had, that's interesting, because this one we had immediately.

1038
01:37:55.500 --> 01:37:58.500
As soon as talking about that.

1039
01:37:58.500 --> 01:38:00.500
Yeah.

1040
01:38:00.500 --> 01:38:02.500
Yeah.

1041
01:38:02.500 --> 01:38:04.500
Okay.

1042
01:38:04.500 --> 01:38:07.000
We have an agreement, everybody?

1043
01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000
Yep.

1044
01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000
Yes.

1045
01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000
Sounds good.

1046
01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000
Great.

1047
01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000
Thank you.

1048

Thank you.

1049
01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000
Thank you.

1050
01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:24.000
You've got to know the word.

1051
01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000
Thank you.

1052
01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.500
I didn't know about that.

1053
01:38:28.500 --> 01:38:30.500
So, oh, Mr.

1054
01:38:30.500 --> 01:38:33.500
