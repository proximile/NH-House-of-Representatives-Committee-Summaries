representative edwards
 
00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:45.440 align:start position:0%
uh i i only have one question but it
 
00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:51.200 align:start position:0%
covers two items it covers uh fis 22 172
 
00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:52.310 align:start position:0%
covers two items it covers uh fis 22 172
and

00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:55.600 align:start position:0%
173 but they could be addressed in just
 
00:11:05.269 --> 00:11:05.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:08.389 --> 00:11:08.399 align:start position:0%
so you would ask that we take those two
 
00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:11.360 align:start position:0%
off the table or off consent if it's
 
00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:14.160 align:start position:0%
easier we could just do one
 
00:11:16.069 --> 00:11:16.079 align:start position:0%
i i don't know if it makes any
 
00:11:17.829 --> 00:11:17.839 align:start position:0%
difference but it's the same question
 
00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:19.360 align:start position:0%
for both
 
00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
items okay if we don't take both of them
 
00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:23.920 align:start position:0%
off and you don't like the answer that
 
00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:25.680 align:start position:0%
you receive
 
00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:26.630 align:start position:0%
you receive
then

00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:26.640 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:30.160 align:start position:0%
then you can't you can't retract it okay
 
00:11:32.069 --> 00:11:32.079 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am i'd like to pull both off all

there's some mention about the easy pass
 
00:13:17.829 --> 00:13:17.839 align:start position:0%
system as you know there's been some
 
00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:20.320 align:start position:0%
concern by fiscal the number of people
 
00:13:21.269 --> 00:13:21.279 align:start position:0%
that are
 
00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:24.320 align:start position:0%
sliding through easy pass and
 
00:13:26.069 --> 00:13:26.079 align:start position:0%
not paying has there been any more
 
00:13:26.079 --> 00:13:27.590 align:start position:0%

progress

00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
progress
 
00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:28.550 align:start position:0%
progress
on

00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:13:32.389 --> 00:13:32.399 align:start position:0%
collection or enforcement or
 
00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:34.160 align:start position:0%
it says in this particular case i have
 
00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
no immediate effect on revenue however
 
00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:39.680 align:start position:0%
may improve the ability of system to
 
00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:42.560 align:start position:0%
collect transactions other than ezpass
 
00:13:44.949 --> 00:13:44.959 align:start position:0%
so it kind of caught my attention yeah
 
00:13:44.959 --> 00:13:45.670 align:start position:0%
so it kind of caught my attention yeah
so

00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:45.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
so this particular transfer request is
 
00:13:49.189 --> 00:13:49.199 align:start position:0%
with our
 
00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:51.920 align:start position:0%

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:52.790 align:start position:0%
interstate iag group
and

00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:13:55.269 --> 00:13:55.279 align:start position:0%
that's with easy pass and so this hub
 
00:13:57.350 --> 00:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
that they're creating
 
00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:00.240 align:start position:0%
will make it easier for us to connect
 
00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:02.320 align:start position:0%
with other ezpass agencies across the
 
00:14:04.389 --> 00:14:04.399 align:start position:0%
country so currently we connect with
 
00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
those on the east coast
 
00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:07.600 align:start position:0%
and this hub that's being created will
 
00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
allow us to connect with the midwest the
 
00:14:12.949 --> 00:14:12.959 align:start position:0%
west coast and those
 
00:14:14.949 --> 00:14:14.959 align:start position:0%
agencies that use ezpass there so when
 
00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
someone from another state is coming
 
00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:18.720 align:start position:0%
through our easy pass we'll be able to
 
00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:20.480 align:start position:0%
automatically collect those fees without
 
00:14:23.269 --> 00:14:23.279 align:start position:0%
having to send out invoices and things
 
00:14:25.189 --> 00:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
so that so that's one that's why it's
 
00:14:26.629 --> 00:14:26.639 align:start position:0%
not immediate
 
00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
building that hub will take a few years
 
00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
and then once that's built we'll be able
 
00:14:32.069 --> 00:14:32.079 align:start position:0%
to do that
 
00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:34.160 align:start position:0%
but we've also implemented several of
 
00:14:37.269 --> 00:14:37.279 align:start position:0%
other areas um we we've added some
 
00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
additional staff in our collections we
 
00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:41.440 align:start position:0%
have about 15 staff in our easy pass
 
00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:42.800 align:start position:0%
collections group
 
00:14:45.269 --> 00:14:45.279 align:start position:0%
that are going after and collecting
 
00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
against violators
 
00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
we've also had a bill this session sb
 
00:14:51.829 --> 00:14:51.839 align:start position:0%
442 that has been passed by both the
 
00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:54.560 align:start position:0%
house and senate to try to uh restrict
 
00:14:56.829 --> 00:14:56.839 align:start position:0%
some of the
 
00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
the folks who violate that go into a dmv
 
00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:00.949 align:start position:0%
the folks who violate that go into a dmv
hold

00:15:00.949 --> 00:15:00.959 align:start position:0%
hold
 
00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:03.440 align:start position:0%
to be able to um
 
00:15:05.269 --> 00:15:05.279 align:start position:0%
restrict their ability to kind of a
 
00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
loophole if they were able to transfer
 
00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
their title to a family member or
 
00:15:11.509 --> 00:15:11.519 align:start position:0%
someone else and avoid paying the fees
 
00:15:12.949 --> 00:15:12.959 align:start position:0%
before they were able to re-register
 
00:15:13.990 --> 00:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
their car
 
00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:16.240 align:start position:0%
so that bill once the governor signs it
 
00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
will eliminate that loophole and allow
 
00:15:19.829 --> 00:15:19.839 align:start position:0%
us to be able to collect
 
00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
from these violators sooner and not have
 
00:15:24.069 --> 00:15:24.079 align:start position:0%
that loophole for them so we we're
 
00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:26.240 align:start position:0%
always looking at those ways and trying
 
00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:27.680 align:start position:0%
to prevent the violators in the first
 
00:15:29.269 --> 00:15:29.279 align:start position:0%
place so we're always looking at
 
00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:30.560 align:start position:0%
different things we can do to try to
 
00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:32.480 align:start position:0%
improve the collections on that thank
 
00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:40.160 align:start position:0%
are there any uh senator d'alessandro
 
00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:42.160 align:start position:0%
thank you very much madam chair and just
 
00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:44.560 align:start position:0%
to follow up with the representative
 
00:15:46.389 --> 00:15:46.399 align:start position:0%
leachman i looked at the little report
 
00:15:49.269 --> 00:15:49.279 align:start position:0%
that you sent us on delinquencies
 
00:15:50.790 --> 00:15:50.800 align:start position:0%
and it looked as if
 
00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:53.120 align:start position:0%
there's five million outstanding is that
 
00:15:54.629 --> 00:15:54.639 align:start position:0%
still the case
 
00:15:57.189 --> 00:15:57.199 align:start position:0%
yes that was as of april 30th okay so
 
00:15:59.590 --> 00:15:59.600 align:start position:0%
five million delinquencies and then on
 
00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:02.160 align:start position:0%
the other side you've collected
 
00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
collected over 11 million
 
00:16:06.069 --> 00:16:06.079 align:start position:0%
and that was over that four year time
 
00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
frame that's over a four-year time frame
 
00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:09.440 align:start position:0%
or nearly four years because we're not
 
00:16:11.189 --> 00:16:11.199 align:start position:0%
done with this fiscal year yet
 
00:16:13.590 --> 00:16:13.600 align:start position:0%
that was on 463 million dollars of
 
00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:15.680 align:start position:0%
revenue that was collected so that turns
 
00:16:17.189 --> 00:16:17.199 align:start position:0%
out to be it's about one percent
 
00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:18.800 align:start position:0%
outstanding right now
 
00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
of total revenues that we've brought in
 
00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:21.749 align:start position:0%
of total revenues that we've brought in
so

00:16:21.749 --> 00:16:21.759 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
so this collections is about one percent
 
00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:25.360 align:start position:0%
and we're still we still pursue those
 
00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
because in the law we're not allowed to
 
00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:29.440 align:start position:0%
um let people
 
00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:30.880 align:start position:0%
you know we're not allowed to release
 
00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:32.480 align:start position:0%
the tolls we have to collect the tolls
 
00:16:33.829 --> 00:16:33.839 align:start position:0%
it's in the law that they're required to
 
00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:35.600 align:start position:0%
pay so
 
00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:37.600 align:start position:0%
okay just wanted to make sure everyone
 
00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:39.680 align:start position:0%
was aware of the fact that there are
 
00:16:41.829 --> 00:16:41.839 align:start position:0%
significant delinquencies people are
 
00:16:43.829 --> 00:16:43.839 align:start position:0%
avoiding the tools
 
00:16:45.509 --> 00:16:45.519 align:start position:0%
and just one if i might one further
 
00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:47.360 align:start position:0%
question the fact that
 
00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:49.440 align:start position:0%
the fact that we don't have
 
00:16:51.829 --> 00:16:51.839 align:start position:0%
the ability to to uh
 
00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
go through after 10 o'clock at night
 
00:16:57.350 --> 00:16:57.360 align:start position:0%
you have
 
00:16:59.110 --> 00:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
you have to
 
00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:01.120 align:start position:0%
use there's nobody there's nobody at the
 
00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:02.800 align:start position:0%
toe boat
 
00:17:05.189 --> 00:17:05.199 align:start position:0%
right so so it's all electronics holding
 
00:17:06.549 --> 00:17:06.559 align:start position:0%
and that's part of this invoice the
 
00:17:08.549 --> 00:17:08.559 align:start position:0%
invoicing process so there are there are
 
00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:10.400 align:start position:0%
multiple ways that folks you know we've
 
00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
tried to make it easier for them to set
 
00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:12.630 align:start position:0%
tried to make it easier for them to set
up

00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:12.640 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:14.480 align:start position:0%
um so there's non-cash payments which
 
00:17:17.029 --> 00:17:17.039 align:start position:0%
have come out and at 7 11 and cbs folks
 
00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:20.400 align:start position:0%
can go and pay cash and just get a
 
00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:22.480 align:start position:0%
rechargeable card so their name and
 
00:17:24.549 --> 00:17:24.559 align:start position:0%
everything isn't associated with it
 
00:17:26.789 --> 00:17:26.799 align:start position:0%
they can get an easy pass and with that
 
00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:28.400 align:start position:0%
you get a discount so if you're a state
 
00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:30.160 align:start position:0%
resident you get a 30 percent discount
 
00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:32.080 align:start position:0%
if you have an easy pass so we try to
 
00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:33.760 align:start position:0%
encourage folks to do that because they
 
00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:36.880 align:start position:0%
get a discount paying cash or
 
00:17:38.549 --> 00:17:38.559 align:start position:0%
paying through this invoice process you
 
00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
get invoice and you get another 50 cent
 
00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:42.880 align:start position:0%
fee on top of the dollar so if they were
 
00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:44.320 align:start position:0%
to get an easy pass they would actually
 
00:17:45.669 --> 00:17:45.679 align:start position:0%
have a discount and be paying less for
 
00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
the tolls so so is it
 
00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:50.720 align:start position:0%
is it proving to be a worthy use to
 
00:17:52.789 --> 00:17:52.799 align:start position:0%
eliminate the total collectors from
 
00:17:54.549 --> 00:17:54.559 align:start position:0%
tenant in the evening until six in the
 
00:17:54.559 --> 00:17:55.590 align:start position:0%
tenant in the evening until six in the
morning

00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:55.600 align:start position:0%
morning
 
00:17:56.950 --> 00:17:56.960 align:start position:0%
is is it
 
00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:00.720 align:start position:0%
is it a zero-sum game or is it a plus
 
00:18:02.549 --> 00:18:02.559 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean when when we looked at that
 
00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:04.960 align:start position:0%
we were actually saving money by doing
 
00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:06.880 align:start position:0%
that the the the volume of traffic
 
00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:09.520 align:start position:0%
during those hours was not as was not
 
00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
significant enough to warrant the the
 
00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:14.480 align:start position:0%
salaries benefits and all the other
 
00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
electricity and other costs so we found
 
00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
it to be a cost savings and that's why
 
00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:20.400 align:start position:0%
we implemented that
 
00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:29.120 align:start position:0%
uh could i have a mo uh

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:52.470 align:start position:0%
the
uh

00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:52.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:53.350 align:start position:0%
uh
the

00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:53.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:55.200 align:start position:0%
the one question i have
 
00:19:57.669 --> 00:19:57.679 align:start position:0%
for this and the next
 
00:19:59.110 --> 00:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
is uh
 
00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:01.280 align:start position:0%
we're moving
 
00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
software money 221 thousand dollars to
 
00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:06.320 align:start position:0%
pay for consultants i don't doubt that
 
00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:08.640 align:start position:0%
you could use some consultants given all
 
00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:10.720 align:start position:0%
the work that's going on but
 
00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:13.200 align:start position:0%
i i'm just curious
 
00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
the 355
 
00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:16.149 align:start position:0%
the 355
000

00:20:16.149 --> 00:20:16.159 align:start position:0%
000
 
00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:18.320 align:start position:0%
between software
 
00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
licenses not being needed
 
00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
uh i'm
 
00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:24.240 align:start position:0%
i must be making a bad assumption about
 
00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
your process i i would think that we're
 
00:20:28.789 --> 00:20:28.799 align:start position:0%
still in the first year of the budget
 
00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:31.840 align:start position:0%
and uh we we should have pretty good
 
00:20:34.390 --> 00:20:34.400 align:start position:0%
estimates going into a budget on what
 
00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:36.720 align:start position:0%
our software licenses are going to cost
 
00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
us and in this case it seems like maybe
 
00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:41.840 align:start position:0%
we're off a lot or i just don't
 
00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:44.320 align:start position:0%
understand the scale so so could you
 
00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:46.880 align:start position:0%
maybe just explain
 
00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:48.880 align:start position:0%
how we found the money
 
00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:50.960 align:start position:0%
sure um there's two sides to the
 
00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:52.480 align:start position:0%
equation and i'll start with the
 
00:20:55.590 --> 00:20:55.600 align:start position:0%
department of safety item um
 
00:20:58.549 --> 00:20:58.559 align:start position:0%
that that item we did um we were in the
 
00:21:00.549 --> 00:21:00.559 align:start position:0%
process of re you know getting ready to
 
00:21:00.559 --> 00:21:01.590 align:start position:0%
process of re you know getting ready to
re-bid

00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
re-bid
 
00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
those services during the planning
 
00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
horizon for the budget so we didn't know
 
00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
and and honestly the
 
00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:10.640 align:start position:0%
the wage inflation inside the it sector
 
00:21:13.029 --> 00:21:13.039 align:start position:0%
has has been pretty steep so i think
 
00:21:15.669 --> 00:21:15.679 align:start position:0%
that contributed to the the bid coming
 
00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:17.600 align:start position:0%
in higher than we expected
 
00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:20.240 align:start position:0%
the two areas where we actually had
 
00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
things come in lower than expected and
 
00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:24.720 align:start position:0%
allowed us to to do this move
 
00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:25.510 align:start position:0%
allowed us to to do this move
where

00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:27.200 align:start position:0%
one was we actually were ahead of
 
00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:28.880 align:start position:0%
schedule on a retirement which saved us
 
00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
some money and licensing money in that
 
00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:33.440 align:start position:0%
and then the other is a project that was
 
00:21:34.789 --> 00:21:34.799 align:start position:0%
actually delayed so that we're not
 
00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:36.400 align:start position:0%
spending it in this fiscal year we'll
 
00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:38.080 align:start position:0%
start spending it next fiscal year so
 
00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:40.320 align:start position:0%
that covers the department of safety in
 
00:21:43.909 --> 00:21:43.919 align:start position:0%
transportation the largest part of that
 
00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
not spend was scope reduction that
 
00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
reduced cost of project and and gave us
 
00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:51.760 align:start position:0%
headroom in order to invest in the in
 
00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:54.320 align:start position:0%
the wiring
 
00:21:55.909 --> 00:21:55.919 align:start position:0%
uh there's there's a
 
00:21:58.390 --> 00:21:58.400 align:start position:0%
additional one where we did a oracle
 
00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:00.400 align:start position:0%
came in to do an audit
 
00:22:02.390 --> 00:22:02.400 align:start position:0%
usually that goes the wrong way you end
 
00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:04.000 align:start position:0%
up spending more money but we actually
 
00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
found ways to save the state money via
 
00:22:09.029 --> 00:22:09.039 align:start position:0%
that audit and then so that actually
 
00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:10.840 align:start position:0%
reduced the cost at
 
00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:13.840 align:start position:0%
dot did you ever follow it
 
00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
yes yes ma'am uh i i think mr glade uh
 
00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:20.240 align:start position:0%
wandered into 173 which i kind of
 
00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:24.640 align:start position:0%
invited him to but with 173 open i would
 
00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:26.720 align:start position:0%
want to also know
 
00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:27.590 align:start position:0%
want to also know
if

00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:30.080 align:start position:0%
because of the supply chain issues
 
00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:32.480 align:start position:0%
do we do you want to tell us
 
00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
whether or not we have any
 
00:22:36.149 --> 00:22:36.159 align:start position:0%
vulnerabilities to replacing key
 
00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:38.840 align:start position:0%
hardware infrastructure due to the
 
00:22:41.909 --> 00:22:41.919 align:start position:0%
unanticipated supply shortages or do you
 
00:22:44.390 --> 00:22:44.400 align:start position:0%
think we're actually okay even if things
 
00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
are delayed a bit
 
00:22:48.549 --> 00:22:48.559 align:start position:0%
uh great question um so
 
00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:51.760 align:start position:0%
this this committee did approve some
 
00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:54.320 align:start position:0%
harpa funding in a prior meeting that
 
00:22:55.590 --> 00:22:55.600 align:start position:0%
allowed us to
 
00:22:57.669 --> 00:22:57.679 align:start position:0%
really essentially replace the major
 
00:22:59.430 --> 00:22:59.440 align:start position:0%
part of the executive branch network
 
00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
we've got a significant percentage of it
 
00:23:02.789 --> 00:23:02.799 align:start position:0%
i think it's
 
00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
like four-fifths of it came in pretty
 
00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:06.230 align:start position:0%
like four-fifths of it came in pretty
quickly

00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
quickly
 
00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
that last fifth is hung up in the supply
 
00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:12.320 align:start position:0%
chain um problems
 
00:23:14.590 --> 00:23:14.600 align:start position:0%
with respect to the uh
 
00:23:17.350 --> 00:23:17.360 align:start position:0%
fis-173 and the wiring that we would
 
00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
want to do the the wiring is definitely
 
00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:22.880 align:start position:0%
particularly fiber optics which we won't
 
00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:25.280 align:start position:0%
we won't need much of is definitely a
 
00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:27.520 align:start position:0%
supply chain issue partly because of
 
00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
supply chain and partly because fiber is
 
00:23:31.669 --> 00:23:31.679 align:start position:0%
in incredible demand right now and so
 
00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
it's it's being bought up as quickly as
 
00:23:34.789 --> 00:23:34.799 align:start position:0%
it shows up
 
00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:36.320 align:start position:0%
so that could take longer than we want
 
00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:37.840 align:start position:0%
it to
 
00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:40.480 align:start position:0%
so so just a little follow-up
 
00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:41.909 align:start position:0%
so so just a little follow-up
yes

00:23:41.909 --> 00:23:41.919 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:23:41.919 --> 00:23:42.710 align:start position:0%
yes
so

00:23:42.710 --> 00:23:42.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:23:45.269 --> 00:23:45.279 align:start position:0%
to get to the the one point
 
00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:47.360 align:start position:0%
you're not ready to tell us that we have
 
00:23:48.789 --> 00:23:48.799 align:start position:0%
any critical
 
00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:51.760 align:start position:0%
shortfalls or risks associated with the
 
00:23:53.190 --> 00:23:53.200 align:start position:0%
supply chain
 
00:23:55.510 --> 00:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
i don't anticipate any i what we've done
 
00:23:57.029 --> 00:23:57.039 align:start position:0%
is we've changed our approach our
 
00:23:58.870 --> 00:23:58.880 align:start position:0%
project approach so that we can continue
 
00:24:01.830 --> 00:24:01.840 align:start position:0%
to move forward and and benefit the
 
00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:02.789 align:start position:0%

00:24:02.789 --> 00:24:02.799 align:start position:0%

uh thanks madam cheer uh thanks for
 
00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:41.360 align:start position:0%
appearing so i had some questions on
 
00:26:44.549 --> 00:26:44.559 align:start position:0%
your explanation certainly i
 
00:26:48.710 --> 00:26:48.720 align:start position:0%
you mentioned uh acquiring uh more space
 
00:26:52.390 --> 00:26:52.400 align:start position:0%
uh developing public kiosks however
 
00:26:53.909 --> 00:26:53.919 align:start position:0%
it goes on to say in the second
 
00:26:56.390 --> 00:26:56.400 align:start position:0%
paragraph that you've already outgrown
 
00:26:58.870 --> 00:26:58.880 align:start position:0%
or grown your space so i was kind of
 
00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:00.480 align:start position:0%
confused on
 
00:27:02.470 --> 00:27:02.480 align:start position:0%
the whole structure there
 
00:27:04.630 --> 00:27:04.640 align:start position:0%
yes i agree that we probably could have
 
00:27:06.549 --> 00:27:06.559 align:start position:0%
made that more clear i think we've
 
00:27:06.559 --> 00:27:07.590 align:start position:0%
made that more clear i think we've
certainly

00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:07.600 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
grown the space the way it's currently
 
00:27:12.070 --> 00:27:12.080 align:start position:0%
structured um as you may recall
 
00:27:15.190 --> 00:27:15.200 align:start position:0%
we originally moved from philbrook um
 
00:27:18.549 --> 00:27:18.559 align:start position:0%
back in i think it was july of 2020.
 
00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:22.480 align:start position:0%
the initial move was on a 30-day lease
 
00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:23.510 align:start position:0%
the initial move was on a 30-day lease
to

00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:26.080 align:start position:0%
approximately i want to say 3 000 square
 
00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:27.909 align:start position:0%
approximately i want to say 3 000 square
feet

00:27:27.909 --> 00:27:27.919 align:start position:0%
feet
 
00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
as that was the only floor that was
 
00:27:31.029 --> 00:27:31.039 align:start position:0%
available at that time at seven eagle
 
00:27:31.039 --> 00:27:32.470 align:start position:0%
available at that time at seven eagle
square

00:27:32.470 --> 00:27:32.480 align:start position:0%
square
 
00:27:34.389 --> 00:27:34.399 align:start position:0%
and also um
 
00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:36.880 align:start position:0%
allowed us to actually execute the lease
 
00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:38.389 align:start position:0%
allowed us to actually execute the lease
um

00:27:38.389 --> 00:27:38.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:40.240 align:start position:0%
expeditiously um because we needed to
 
00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:42.080 align:start position:0%
get out of the building um we
 
00:27:44.310 --> 00:27:44.320 align:start position:0%
subsequently amended the lease or
 
00:27:46.470 --> 00:27:46.480 align:start position:0%
entered into a full 10-year lease with
 
00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:48.880 align:start position:0%
the first second and
 
00:27:50.470 --> 00:27:50.480 align:start position:0%
third floors
 
00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:51.430 align:start position:0%
third floors
and

00:27:51.430 --> 00:27:51.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:27:53.029 --> 00:27:53.039 align:start position:0%
if my memory served me correctly that
 
00:27:56.710 --> 00:27:56.720 align:start position:0%
was approximately uh 20 000 ish square
 
00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:58.070 align:start position:0%
was approximately uh 20 000 ish square
feet

00:27:58.070 --> 00:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
feet
 
00:28:00.070 --> 00:28:00.080 align:start position:0%
which was substantially less than what
 
00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
we had had at philbrook which was
 
00:28:03.909 --> 00:28:03.919 align:start position:0%
approximately 30 000 square feet um so
 
00:28:05.669 --> 00:28:05.679 align:start position:0%
we moved into the building with addition
 
00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:07.360 align:start position:0%
you know with additional staff and we
 
00:28:09.029 --> 00:28:09.039 align:start position:0%
had when we first moved in phil brook in
 
00:28:09.039 --> 00:28:10.470 align:start position:0%
had when we first moved in phil brook in
2015

00:28:10.470 --> 00:28:10.480 align:start position:0%
2015
 
00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:12.640 align:start position:0%
um and we had fewer space so when
 
00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:14.720 align:start position:0%
deloitte vacated that space on the
 
00:28:17.110 --> 00:28:17.120 align:start position:0%
fourth floor of seven eagle square
 
00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:20.080 align:start position:0%
we again saw an amendment to our
 
00:28:22.389 --> 00:28:22.399 align:start position:0%
existing space
 
00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:25.200 align:start position:0%
or our existing lease to
 
00:28:27.029 --> 00:28:27.039 align:start position:0%
acquire that space and that was approved
 
00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:28.840 align:start position:0%
by governor and council of last year
 
00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:31.360 align:start position:0%
september i want to say it was 15th of
 
00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:32.950 align:start position:0%
september i want to say it was 15th of
2021.

00:28:32.950 --> 00:28:32.960 align:start position:0%
2021.
 
00:28:34.549 --> 00:28:34.559 align:start position:0%
the way the space was originally
 
00:28:34.559 --> 00:28:36.230 align:start position:0%
the way the space was originally
configured

00:28:36.230 --> 00:28:36.240 align:start position:0%
configured
 
00:28:38.389 --> 00:28:38.399 align:start position:0%
it doesn't it doesn't allow us to use
 
00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
the space effectively so i would say
 
00:28:42.870 --> 00:28:42.880 align:start position:0%
that there's sufficient space but it's
 
00:28:45.029 --> 00:28:45.039 align:start position:0%
not configured in a way that allows us
 
00:28:47.350 --> 00:28:47.360 align:start position:0%
to effectively utilize the space
 
00:28:49.750 --> 00:28:49.760 align:start position:0%
i will also say that i think of the
 
00:28:53.430 --> 00:28:53.440 align:start position:0%
requests uh the renovation line items i
 
00:28:55.269 --> 00:28:55.279 align:start position:0%
think are in class one
 
00:28:55.279 --> 00:28:56.870 align:start position:0%
think are in class one
103

00:28:56.870 --> 00:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
103
 
00:28:58.389 --> 00:28:58.399 align:start position:0%
which is
 
00:29:01.029 --> 00:29:01.039 align:start position:0%
not a significant amount of construction
 
00:29:03.029 --> 00:29:03.039 align:start position:0%
um that needs to be done in the amount
 
00:29:08.070 --> 00:29:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:10.950 --> 00:29:10.960 align:start position:0%
further question madam cheer yes please
 
00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:13.200 align:start position:0%
so with these additional
 
00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
acquisitions or floors you now have
 
00:29:18.389 --> 00:29:18.399 align:start position:0%
adequate space at eagle square
 
00:29:20.710 --> 00:29:20.720 align:start position:0%
i would say with our current uh with our
 
00:29:22.950 --> 00:29:22.960 align:start position:0%
current staffing we have adequate space
 
00:29:25.269 --> 00:29:25.279 align:start position:0%
um of course we continue to take on
 
00:29:27.510 --> 00:29:27.520 align:start position:0%
additional boards
 
00:29:30.310 --> 00:29:30.320 align:start position:0%
as time goes on so i'm not sure that
 
00:29:32.470 --> 00:29:32.480 align:start position:0%
that will be the case
 
00:29:34.149 --> 00:29:34.159 align:start position:0%
you know in the future
 
00:29:36.149 --> 00:29:36.159 align:start position:0%
if if we can continue to take on
 
00:29:36.159 --> 00:29:37.510 align:start position:0%
if if we can continue to take on
additional

00:29:37.510 --> 00:29:37.520 align:start position:0%
additional
 
00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:40.320 align:start position:0%
agencies but for right now if we were to
 
00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:42.320 align:start position:0%
do the construction that is planned and
 
00:29:44.470 --> 00:29:44.480 align:start position:0%
it really is just to make
 
00:29:46.230 --> 00:29:46.240 align:start position:0%
two additional conference rooms because
 
00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:47.600 align:start position:0%
our boards are required to meet in
 
00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:49.029 align:start position:0%
our boards are required to meet in
person

00:29:49.029 --> 00:29:49.039 align:start position:0%
person
 
00:29:51.110 --> 00:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
as well as to
 
00:29:54.630 --> 00:29:54.640 align:start position:0%
create a planned customer service space
 
00:29:57.430 --> 00:29:57.440 align:start position:0%
our space should be sufficient
 
00:29:59.430 --> 00:29:59.440 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you madam chair
 
00:30:01.590 --> 00:30:01.600 align:start position:0%
are there any uh
 
00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
senator rosenwald thank you i think
 
00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:05.840 align:start position:0%
that's more question for commissioner
 
00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:08.310 align:start position:0%
that's more question for commissioner

oh don't don't leave right
[Laughter]

00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:30:22.870 --> 00:30:22.880 align:start position:0%
thank you good morning um to both of you
 
00:30:26.149 --> 00:30:26.159 align:start position:0%
um director um courtney sent us some
 
00:30:28.870 --> 00:30:28.880 align:start position:0%
information indicating that the
 
00:30:32.310 --> 00:30:32.320 align:start position:0%
cost per square foot at eagle square was
 
00:30:35.430 --> 00:30:35.440 align:start position:0%
something like 22.50
 
00:30:36.389 --> 00:30:36.399 align:start position:0%
or something
 
00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
my question is what is the average
 
00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:41.440 align:start position:0%
state cost
 
00:30:43.430 --> 00:30:43.440 align:start position:0%
per square foot for
 
00:30:46.630 --> 00:30:46.640 align:start position:0%
office space how i mean
 
00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:48.720 align:start position:0%
is it
 
00:30:50.950 --> 00:30:50.960 align:start position:0%
ever is this on the average side or this
 
00:30:53.269 --> 00:30:53.279 align:start position:0%
is probably not on the average side um i
 
00:30:55.029 --> 00:30:55.039 align:start position:0%
so i don't have an average cost with me
 
00:30:58.470 --> 00:30:58.480 align:start position:0%
and it depends a lot on on uh
 
00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:00.720 align:start position:0%
you know a lot of the space we lease is
 
00:31:03.029 --> 00:31:03.039 align:start position:0%
in um
 
00:31:04.389 --> 00:31:04.399 align:start position:0%
uh is out and about
 
00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
courthouses for example um and so with
 
00:31:09.430 --> 00:31:09.440 align:start position:0%
something like we lease something like
 
00:31:12.470 --> 00:31:12.480 align:start position:0%
15 court houses around the state and you
 
00:31:14.389 --> 00:31:14.399 align:start position:0%
know the leasing cost is a lot less than
 
00:31:16.389 --> 00:31:16.399 align:start position:0%
at least in salem for example that kind
 
00:31:18.470 --> 00:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
of thing so it depends on the location
 
00:31:20.149 --> 00:31:20.159 align:start position:0%
uh the type of fit up
 
00:31:23.909 --> 00:31:23.919 align:start position:0%
uh that that's required this space
 
00:31:26.789 --> 00:31:26.799 align:start position:0%
is downtown concord so it's higher than
 
00:31:29.509 --> 00:31:29.519 align:start position:0%
the statewide average would be
 
00:31:32.549 --> 00:31:32.559 align:start position:0%
but when we when we bid the space it was
 
00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:35.360 align:start position:0%
the lowest available space at the time
 
00:31:37.430 --> 00:31:37.440 align:start position:0%
and so what what typically happens is
 
00:31:39.110 --> 00:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
when uh when we have a need for space
 
00:31:41.029 --> 00:31:41.039 align:start position:0%
and uh this space was originally created
 
00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
by the
 
00:31:43.990 --> 00:31:44.000 align:start position:0%
uh the need to close phil brook or not
 
00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
closed phil brook but to reconvert phil
 
00:31:49.029 --> 00:31:49.039 align:start position:0%
brook back to its prior use um and so we
 
00:31:51.909 --> 00:31:51.919 align:start position:0%
moved everybody out and we we um
 
00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
we looked at space in the city of
 
00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:54.789 align:start position:0%
we looked at space in the city of
concord

00:31:54.789 --> 00:31:54.799 align:start position:0%
concord
 
00:31:57.029 --> 00:31:57.039 align:start position:0%
um anywhere in the city of concord and
 
00:31:58.630 --> 00:31:58.640 align:start position:0%
and i think
 
00:31:59.990 --> 00:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
and don't hold me to this because it's
 
00:32:01.590 --> 00:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
been a couple years but
 
00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:02.470 align:start position:0%
been a couple years but
uh

00:32:02.470 --> 00:32:02.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:32:04.470 --> 00:32:04.480 align:start position:0%
something like three or four spaces um
 
00:32:06.389 --> 00:32:06.399 align:start position:0%
gail rucker at the time was our was our
 
00:32:07.750 --> 00:32:07.760 align:start position:0%
lease coordinator
 
00:32:09.269 --> 00:32:09.279 align:start position:0%
um that she looked at and this was the
 
00:32:11.029 --> 00:32:11.039 align:start position:0%
cheapest of the
 
00:32:11.039 --> 00:32:14.070 align:start position:0%
cheapest of the
three

00:32:14.070 --> 00:32:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:15.110 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:32:17.590 --> 00:32:17.600 align:start position:0%
relative to other space we lease and
 
00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:19.350 align:start position:0%
relative to other space we lease and
conquered

00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:19.360 align:start position:0%
conquered
 
00:32:22.630 --> 00:32:22.640 align:start position:0%
then it's higher it's higher downtown
 
00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:25.909 align:start position:0%
then it's higher it's higher downtown
um

00:32:25.909 --> 00:32:25.919 align:start position:0%

00:37:45.910 --> 00:37:45.920 align:start position:0%
about what you're really going to do
 
00:37:48.630 --> 00:37:48.640 align:start position:0%
what standard is are we short in
 
00:37:50.790 --> 00:37:50.800 align:start position:0%

representative edwards so this

component speaks to fire stopping in
 
00:38:07.839 --> 00:38:08.950 align:start position:0%
component speaks to fire stopping in
particular

00:38:08.950 --> 00:38:08.960 align:start position:0%
particular
 
00:38:10.790 --> 00:38:10.800 align:start position:0%
as you may be aware in healthcare
 
00:38:12.550 --> 00:38:12.560 align:start position:0%
settings we have to have secure
 
00:38:14.790 --> 00:38:14.800 align:start position:0%
firewalls and fire barriers within the
 
00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:16.069 align:start position:0%
firewalls and fire barriers within the
facility

00:38:16.069 --> 00:38:16.079 align:start position:0%
facility
 
00:38:18.310 --> 00:38:18.320 align:start position:0%
so new hampshire hospital does currently
 
00:38:20.390 --> 00:38:20.400 align:start position:0%
have some penetrations is what they're
 
00:38:22.870 --> 00:38:22.880 align:start position:0%
referred to by joint commission within
 
00:38:25.589 --> 00:38:25.599 align:start position:0%
our ceilings and in our walls that could
 
00:38:28.150 --> 00:38:28.160 align:start position:0%
be of smoke and fire concern if there
 
00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:29.440 align:start position:0%
ever was
 
00:38:31.109 --> 00:38:31.119 align:start position:0%
that type of issue within new hampshire
 
00:38:34.550 --> 00:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
hospital so this component would
 
00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:35.670 align:start position:0%
hospital so this component would
address

00:38:35.670 --> 00:38:35.680 align:start position:0%
address
 
00:38:38.390 --> 00:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
those areas within the hospital and sure
 
00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:39.349 align:start position:0%
those areas within the hospital and sure
up

00:38:39.349 --> 00:38:39.359 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:38:41.349 --> 00:38:41.359 align:start position:0%
fire stopping capabilities within the
 
00:38:44.310 --> 00:38:44.320 align:start position:0%
organization it also speaks to some door
 
00:38:46.870 --> 00:38:46.880 align:start position:0%
closers which also have pertinence in
 
00:38:49.190 --> 00:38:49.200 align:start position:0%
regards to fire stopping
 
00:38:50.470 --> 00:38:50.480 align:start position:0%
all right all right thank you that
 
00:38:52.390 --> 00:38:52.400 align:start position:0%
that's good information
 
00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
we might want to include that level of
 
00:38:57.270 --> 00:38:57.280 align:start position:0%
detail in future requests may i ask a
 
00:38:59.829 --> 00:38:59.839 align:start position:0%
follow-up on yes you may
 
00:39:02.310 --> 00:39:02.320 align:start position:0%
retain a consulting firm to advise the
 
00:39:04.069 --> 00:39:04.079 align:start position:0%
department on key aspects of the
 
00:39:07.109 --> 00:39:07.119 align:start position:0%
forensic hospital operation this doesn't
 
00:39:10.310 --> 00:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
say how much we're going to spend and
 
00:39:13.910 --> 00:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
and which which particular key issues we
 
00:39:15.670 --> 00:39:15.680 align:start position:0%
think they're going to be looking at
 
00:39:18.230 --> 00:39:18.240 align:start position:0%
because i i believe we funded
 
00:39:20.630 --> 00:39:20.640 align:start position:0%
the forensic hospital in the last budget
 
00:39:22.790 --> 00:39:22.800 align:start position:0%
and it was a bunch of money to include
 
00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:24.230 align:start position:0%
and it was a bunch of money to include
consulting

00:39:24.230 --> 00:39:24.240 align:start position:0%
consulting
 
00:39:26.829 --> 00:39:26.839 align:start position:0%
correct um
 
00:39:32.470 --> 00:39:32.480 align:start position:0%
so sorry that's okay um so uh
 
00:39:34.790 --> 00:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
from a dollar figure perspective i
 
00:39:37.030 --> 00:39:37.040 align:start position:0%
believe we were estimating something
 
00:39:38.310 --> 00:39:38.320 align:start position:0%
i want to say it was around a hundred
 
00:39:40.390 --> 00:39:40.400 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars for this this is really
 
00:39:42.390 --> 00:39:42.400 align:start position:0%
for the operations so we do have the
 
00:39:45.270 --> 00:39:45.280 align:start position:0%
funding necessary to build a facility we
 
00:39:47.430 --> 00:39:47.440 align:start position:0%
do have an architecture firm who has
 
00:39:49.670 --> 00:39:49.680 align:start position:0%
experience in constructing forensic
 
00:39:51.910 --> 00:39:51.920 align:start position:0%
hospitals but we have no experience in
 
00:39:53.349 --> 00:39:53.359 align:start position:0%
operating one
 
00:39:55.510 --> 00:39:55.520 align:start position:0%
and so we're really looking for somebody
 
00:39:57.829 --> 00:39:57.839 align:start position:0%
to have on retainer who has operated one
 
00:39:59.510 --> 00:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
of these before to help provide us some
 
00:40:01.270 --> 00:40:01.280 align:start position:0%
insight as to
 
00:40:03.190 --> 00:40:03.200 align:start position:0%
things to watch out for
 
00:40:05.510 --> 00:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
and as well as maybe design
 
00:40:07.190 --> 00:40:07.200 align:start position:0%
considerations that they would have
 
00:40:08.790 --> 00:40:08.800 align:start position:0%
changed in the facilities that they had
 
00:40:10.230 --> 00:40:10.240 align:start position:0%
worked in that we have not yet thought
 
00:40:11.430 --> 00:40:11.440 align:start position:0%
of so
 
00:40:15.349 --> 00:40:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:16.550 --> 00:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
uh yes
 
00:40:18.390 --> 00:40:18.400 align:start position:0%
uh thank you and thank you for the
 
00:40:21.349 --> 00:40:21.359 align:start position:0%
answer i uh will you be asking them to
 
00:40:24.150 --> 00:40:24.160 align:start position:0%
specifically take a look at
 
00:40:26.550 --> 00:40:26.560 align:start position:0%
operationally what the impact might be
 
00:40:28.870 --> 00:40:28.880 align:start position:0%
on the virtualization of some of the
 
00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:31.030 align:start position:0%
on the virtualization of some of the
services

00:40:31.030 --> 00:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:40:32.230 --> 00:40:32.240 align:start position:0%
such as
 
00:40:36.150 --> 00:40:36.160 align:start position:0%
remote cons counseling
 
00:40:38.470 --> 00:40:38.480 align:start position:0%
those sorts of things are you kind of
 
00:40:39.910 --> 00:40:39.920 align:start position:0%
speaking in regards to telehealth
 
00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:42.550 align:start position:0%
speaking in regards to telehealth
capabilities

00:40:42.550 --> 00:40:42.560 align:start position:0%
capabilities
 
00:40:45.750 --> 00:40:45.760 align:start position:0%
yes to have telehealth built into it so
 
00:40:47.990 --> 00:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
that we have flexibility in the manpower
 
00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:48.790 align:start position:0%
that we have flexibility in the manpower
side

00:40:48.790 --> 00:40:48.800 align:start position:0%
side
 
00:40:50.630 --> 00:40:50.640 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:40:52.790 --> 00:40:52.800 align:start position:0%
in our experience during the pandemic
 
00:40:54.550 --> 00:40:54.560 align:start position:0%
we've actually
 
00:40:56.550 --> 00:40:56.560 align:start position:0%
tried some telehealth with new hampshire
 
00:40:56.560 --> 00:40:57.829 align:start position:0%
tried some telehealth with new hampshire
hospital

00:40:57.829 --> 00:40:57.839 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
00:40:59.829 --> 00:40:59.839 align:start position:0%
it's very challenging in an inpatient
 
00:41:01.589 --> 00:41:01.599 align:start position:0%
psychiatric setting to use telehealth
 
00:41:01.599 --> 00:41:02.870 align:start position:0%
psychiatric setting to use telehealth
services

00:41:02.870 --> 00:41:02.880 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:41:04.390 --> 00:41:04.400 align:start position:0%
part of that face-to-face interaction
 
00:41:05.910 --> 00:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
and rapport that you build with patients
 
00:41:07.430 --> 00:41:07.440 align:start position:0%
is actually very important to the care
 
00:41:08.950 --> 00:41:08.960 align:start position:0%
that we deliver
 
00:41:10.069 --> 00:41:10.079 align:start position:0%
so i
 
00:41:11.750 --> 00:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
that's not something we've necessarily
 
00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:13.109 align:start position:0%
that's not something we've necessarily
considered

00:41:13.109 --> 00:41:13.119 align:start position:0%
considered
 
00:41:14.950 --> 00:41:14.960 align:start position:0%
relative to to this consulting
 
00:41:16.230 --> 00:41:16.240 align:start position:0%
engagement just because in our
 
00:41:17.670 --> 00:41:17.680 align:start position:0%
experience at new hampshire hospital
 
00:41:21.030 --> 00:41:21.040 align:start position:0%
it's been very challenging to implement
 
00:41:23.190 --> 00:41:23.200 align:start position:0%
so so i'd like to just make a comment on
 
00:41:25.630 --> 00:41:25.640 align:start position:0%
that telemedicine started in
 
00:41:27.470 --> 00:41:27.480 align:start position:0%
telepsychiatry in
 
00:41:30.230 --> 00:41:30.240 align:start position:0%
1962 at the nebraska medical center and
 
00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
dartmouth started doing it if there's
 
00:41:34.710 --> 00:41:34.720 align:start position:0%
one telemedicine clinical application
 
00:41:36.790 --> 00:41:36.800 align:start position:0%
that's really been proven it's in the
 
00:41:40.150 --> 00:41:40.160 align:start position:0%
mental health area so i i would i would
 
00:41:43.349 --> 00:41:43.359 align:start position:0%
encourage you to push on that because we
 
00:41:46.790 --> 00:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
could see to a new hampshire hospital as
 
00:41:51.030 --> 00:41:51.040 align:start position:0%
being both a catcher's mitt for
 
00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:52.630 align:start position:0%
being both a catcher's mitt for
telepsychiatry

00:41:52.630 --> 00:41:52.640 align:start position:0%
telepsychiatry
 
00:41:56.069 --> 00:41:56.079 align:start position:0%
and as a support agency to to promote
 
00:41:59.109 --> 00:41:59.119 align:start position:0%
out into the community and so i'd really
 
00:42:00.150 --> 00:42:00.160 align:start position:0%
like to
 
00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
see y'all
 
00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
yourselves on the operational side to
 
00:42:06.870 --> 00:42:06.880 align:start position:0%
play a bigger role in a virtual health
 
00:42:08.309 --> 00:42:08.319 align:start position:0%
care system
 
00:42:08.319 --> 00:42:09.430 align:start position:0%
care system
so

00:42:09.430 --> 00:42:09.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:42:12.309 --> 00:42:12.319 align:start position:0%
i have a different question yes but i
 
00:42:13.670 --> 00:42:13.680 align:start position:0%
have a question
 
00:42:20.630 --> 00:42:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:22.630 --> 00:42:22.640 align:start position:0%
maybe i'm confused
 
00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:23.750 align:start position:0%
maybe i'm confused
um

00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:26.390 --> 00:42:26.400 align:start position:0%
you said that you had no experience in
 
00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:27.349 align:start position:0%
you said that you had no experience in
running

00:42:27.349 --> 00:42:27.359 align:start position:0%
running
 
00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:34.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:36.390 --> 00:42:36.400 align:start position:0%
hospital maybe that is whatever the term
 
00:42:39.030 --> 00:42:39.040 align:start position:0%
is i want to know who's been in charge
 
00:42:41.190 --> 00:42:41.200 align:start position:0%
of the forensic hospital that's
 
00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:43.520 align:start position:0%
currently located in the prison i mean
 
00:42:45.990 --> 00:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
you can't tell me you have no experience
 
00:42:47.750 --> 00:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
when i thought
 
00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:48.630 align:start position:0%
when i thought
that

00:42:48.630 --> 00:42:48.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:42:52.309 --> 00:42:52.319 align:start position:0%
your agency was the one that managed
 
00:42:54.870 --> 00:42:54.880 align:start position:0%
what went on within
 
00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:56.069 align:start position:0%
what went on within
the

00:42:56.069 --> 00:42:56.079 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:42:59.910 --> 00:42:59.920 align:start position:0%
men's prison so the secure psychiatric
 
00:43:02.390 --> 00:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
unit is that what you're referring to
 
00:43:05.270 --> 00:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
is part of the department of corrections
 
00:43:08.390 --> 00:43:08.400 align:start position:0%
so new hampshire hospital does have some
 
00:43:11.270 --> 00:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
forensic patients within our h unit
 
00:43:14.230 --> 00:43:14.240 align:start position:0%
however the population that
 
00:43:16.150 --> 00:43:16.160 align:start position:0%
will be coming to new hampshire hospital
 
00:43:18.309 --> 00:43:18.319 align:start position:0%
into the forensic facility currently
 
00:43:20.870 --> 00:43:20.880 align:start position:0%
residing at spu are overseen by
 
00:43:23.430 --> 00:43:23.440 align:start position:0%
department of corrections
 
00:43:26.790 --> 00:43:26.800 align:start position:0%
okay sorry i had
 
00:43:28.550 --> 00:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
had that wrong thank you
 
00:43:31.109 --> 00:43:31.119 align:start position:0%
uh senator rosenwald you had a question
 
00:43:32.790 --> 00:43:32.800 align:start position:0%
i did on a
 
00:43:34.950 --> 00:43:34.960 align:start position:0%
kind of a different
 
00:43:36.550 --> 00:43:36.560 align:start position:0%
line if i could
 
00:43:37.589 --> 00:43:37.599 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:43:39.510 --> 00:43:39.520 align:start position:0%
two of the items
 
00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:40.550 align:start position:0%
two of the items
number

00:43:40.550 --> 00:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
number
 
00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:42.230 align:start position:0%
number
seven

00:43:42.230 --> 00:43:42.240 align:start position:0%
seven
 
00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:43.109 align:start position:0%
seven
and

00:43:43.109 --> 00:43:43.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:43:44.710 --> 00:43:44.720 align:start position:0%
number 12
 
00:43:48.790 --> 00:43:48.800 align:start position:0%
talk about new furniture in the cafe and
 
00:43:51.589 --> 00:43:51.599 align:start position:0%
in non-specifically in the hospital
 
00:43:54.230 --> 00:43:54.240 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering what the current balance
 
00:43:57.109 --> 00:43:57.119 align:start position:0%
is in the patient trust fund
 
00:43:59.750 --> 00:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
account and whether
 
00:44:02.390 --> 00:44:02.400 align:start position:0%
you had considered
 
00:44:05.030 --> 00:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
covering these costs with that as i
 
00:44:07.750 --> 00:44:07.760 align:start position:0%
think we've done in the past
 
00:44:09.270 --> 00:44:09.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question and it's a
 
00:44:12.230 --> 00:44:12.240 align:start position:0%
very good one so um the patient trust
 
00:44:15.270 --> 00:44:15.280 align:start position:0%
fund uh balance or principle overall
 
00:44:17.750 --> 00:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
stands at around eight million dollars
 
00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:19.990 align:start position:0%
stands at around eight million dollars
we

00:44:19.990 --> 00:44:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:22.150 --> 00:44:22.160 align:start position:0%
purchasing furniture through the trust
 
00:44:24.550 --> 00:44:24.560 align:start position:0%
fund is is
 
00:44:26.630 --> 00:44:26.640 align:start position:0%
not advised i guess is the best way to
 
00:44:29.349 --> 00:44:29.359 align:start position:0%
to put it we've done so in the past
 
00:44:33.270 --> 00:44:33.280 align:start position:0%
really only after a request for
 
00:44:35.430 --> 00:44:35.440 align:start position:0%
that funding through the legislature
 
00:44:37.670 --> 00:44:37.680 align:start position:0%
did not make it through the budget cycle
 
00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
and we felt there was kind of a
 
00:44:41.910 --> 00:44:41.920 align:start position:0%
significant need to replace those items
 
00:44:44.630 --> 00:44:44.640 align:start position:0%
in a timely fashion most of the time
 
00:44:46.069 --> 00:44:46.079 align:start position:0%
it's because there a lot of wood
 
00:44:48.150 --> 00:44:48.160 align:start position:0%
furniture is still in the hospital wood
 
00:44:49.589 --> 00:44:49.599 align:start position:0%
is not up to
 
00:44:52.150 --> 00:44:52.160 align:start position:0%
current standards for infection control
 
00:44:53.670 --> 00:44:53.680 align:start position:0%
and that furniture can also be broken
 
00:44:55.910 --> 00:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
and used for object aggression
 
00:44:58.550 --> 00:44:58.560 align:start position:0%
so we have not gone to the trust fund
 
00:45:00.309 --> 00:45:00.319 align:start position:0%
for this just because it's really not
 
00:45:01.829 --> 00:45:01.839 align:start position:0%
been advised
 
00:45:03.109 --> 00:45:03.119 align:start position:0%
could i follow
 
00:45:05.510 --> 00:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
certainly thank you so i think the last
 
00:45:07.910 --> 00:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
time we we looked at this trust fund in
 
00:45:10.550 --> 00:45:10.560 align:start position:0%
the budget process the balance was about
 
00:45:12.150 --> 00:45:12.160 align:start position:0%
4 million
 
00:45:15.030 --> 00:45:15.040 align:start position:0%
dollars it's now doubled
 
00:45:17.510 --> 00:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
what do we spend that
 
00:45:20.870 --> 00:45:20.880 align:start position:0%
money on i know it's to benefit
 
00:45:23.510 --> 00:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
patient experience but
 
00:45:25.430 --> 00:45:25.440 align:start position:0%
that's a lot of money
 
00:45:28.309 --> 00:45:28.319 align:start position:0%
absolutely um i think in my three years
 
00:45:30.230 --> 00:45:30.240 align:start position:0%
here the trust fund has been around
 
00:45:33.190 --> 00:45:33.200 align:start position:0%
seven million it's now grown to eight um
 
00:45:35.109 --> 00:45:35.119 align:start position:0%
and the majority of what we we spend
 
00:45:37.270 --> 00:45:37.280 align:start position:0%
trust fund may fund money on we try to
 
00:45:39.430 --> 00:45:39.440 align:start position:0%
live on the interest earned every year
 
00:45:41.109 --> 00:45:41.119 align:start position:0%
and not necessarily touch a lot of the
 
00:45:43.190 --> 00:45:43.200 align:start position:0%
principle and we do that because we use
 
00:45:44.630 --> 00:45:44.640 align:start position:0%
a lot of that funding to help with
 
00:45:47.030 --> 00:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
discharge means for patients so if we're
 
00:45:48.390 --> 00:45:48.400 align:start position:0%
discharging a patient and they don't
 
00:45:50.390 --> 00:45:50.400 align:start position:0%
have a pair of shoes or they don't have
 
00:45:52.710 --> 00:45:52.720 align:start position:0%
a set of clothing or they might need
 
00:45:54.950 --> 00:45:54.960 align:start position:0%
first month's rent to get them into a
 
00:45:57.349 --> 00:45:57.359 align:start position:0%
new apartment that's the majority of
 
00:45:59.270 --> 00:45:59.280 align:start position:0%
what we use the trust fund for today is
 
00:46:00.390 --> 00:46:00.400 align:start position:0%
to try to help
 
00:46:02.309 --> 00:46:02.319 align:start position:0%
those transitions into the community for
 
00:46:03.430 --> 00:46:03.440 align:start position:0%
for patients who don't have the
 
00:46:07.589 --> 00:46:07.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:10.230 --> 00:46:10.240 align:start position:0%
represent edwards
 
00:46:13.589 --> 00:46:13.599 align:start position:0%
thank you man i'm sure i'm down now on
 
00:46:16.550 --> 00:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
item five project five on the learning
 
00:46:18.470 --> 00:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
management system
 
00:46:21.589 --> 00:46:21.599 align:start position:0%
and uh i i don't know if mr kane was
 
00:46:23.670 --> 00:46:23.680 align:start position:0%
able to get some information on this for
 
00:46:27.109 --> 00:46:27.119 align:start position:0%
us but we had talked uh in prep for this
 
00:46:29.750 --> 00:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
that um i believe that the the
 
00:46:32.069 --> 00:46:32.079 align:start position:0%
department of administrative services
 
00:46:34.470 --> 00:46:34.480 align:start position:0%
ought to have a learning management
 
00:46:36.069 --> 00:46:36.079 align:start position:0%
system already
 
00:46:38.630 --> 00:46:38.640 align:start position:0%
and so it made me wonder when i saw this
 
00:46:41.270 --> 00:46:41.280 align:start position:0%
as a separate standalone project
 
00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:42.630 align:start position:0%
as a separate standalone project
if

00:46:42.630 --> 00:46:42.640 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:46:45.109 --> 00:46:45.119 align:start position:0%
you shouldn't be trying to leverage an
 
00:46:48.150 --> 00:46:48.160 align:start position:0%
existing lms system that's already
 
00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:49.430 align:start position:0%
existing lms system that's already
in-house

00:46:49.430 --> 00:46:49.440 align:start position:0%
in-house
 
00:46:51.109 --> 00:46:51.119 align:start position:0%
and then you can expand it if you have
 
00:46:52.950 --> 00:46:52.960 align:start position:0%
special training that you want included
 
00:46:55.750 --> 00:46:55.760 align:start position:0%
that's not there today but i i'd hate to
 
00:46:58.150 --> 00:46:58.160 align:start position:0%
see us going out and procuring another
 
00:47:05.190 --> 00:47:05.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:07.270 --> 00:47:07.280 align:start position:0%
mr allen house yeah
 
00:47:09.589 --> 00:47:09.599 align:start position:0%
mr owlinghouse if you
 
00:47:09.599 --> 00:47:10.390 align:start position:0%
mr owlinghouse if you
prefer

00:47:10.390 --> 00:47:10.400 align:start position:0%
prefer
 
00:47:13.910 --> 00:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
you can use that mic
 
00:47:16.870 --> 00:47:16.880 align:start position:0%
yeah that's that's fine
 
00:47:18.710 --> 00:47:18.720 align:start position:0%
i think they're all working no i didn't
 
00:47:20.790 --> 00:47:20.800 align:start position:0%
realize they all worked um
 
00:47:22.950 --> 00:47:22.960 align:start position:0%
and i apologize i think mike probably
 
00:47:25.349 --> 00:47:25.359 align:start position:0%
emailed me and i blew him off and so
 
00:47:27.829 --> 00:47:27.839 align:start position:0%
sorry um
 
00:47:29.589 --> 00:47:29.599 align:start position:0%
you're quite correct that the bureau of
 
00:47:31.190 --> 00:47:31.200 align:start position:0%
education and training ought to have a
 
00:47:33.510 --> 00:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
learning management system
 
00:47:37.030 --> 00:47:37.040 align:start position:0%
um that doesn't mean we do
 
00:47:38.390 --> 00:47:38.400 align:start position:0%
we've asked for one in the capital
 
00:47:40.950 --> 00:47:40.960 align:start position:0%
budget for a few years and uh
 
00:47:42.069 --> 00:47:42.079 align:start position:0%
so far
 
00:47:44.470 --> 00:47:44.480 align:start position:0%
no takers uh we're asking again this
 
00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:45.510 align:start position:0%
no takers uh we're asking again this
year

00:47:45.510 --> 00:47:45.520 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:47:46.790 --> 00:47:46.800 align:start position:0%
and we're hoping somebody might be
 
00:47:49.109 --> 00:47:49.119 align:start position:0%
interested in us having one but we don't
 
00:47:51.109 --> 00:47:51.119 align:start position:0%
have an lms that can piggyback because
 
00:47:53.030 --> 00:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
uh so far the governor and the
 
00:47:55.109 --> 00:47:55.119 align:start position:0%
legislature have not
 
00:47:56.950 --> 00:47:56.960 align:start position:0%
have decided other priorities are more
 
00:48:00.309 --> 00:48:00.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:00.319 --> 00:48:01.190 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:48:01.190 --> 00:48:01.200 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:48:03.510 --> 00:48:03.520 align:start position:0%
okay okay that's that's surprising and
 
00:48:05.990 --> 00:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
lms's core i think to
 
00:48:10.309 --> 00:48:10.319 align:start position:0%
hr development we we think so too so um
 
00:48:12.870 --> 00:48:12.880 align:start position:0%
so so given that we're we are probably
 
00:48:15.589 --> 00:48:15.599 align:start position:0%
on the verge of authorizing an lms at a
 
00:48:17.750 --> 00:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
departmental level
 
00:48:19.829 --> 00:48:19.839 align:start position:0%
buried in the bowels of new hampshire
 
00:48:22.390 --> 00:48:22.400 align:start position:0%
hospital are you able to work with them
 
00:48:24.950 --> 00:48:24.960 align:start position:0%
on requirements so that we can maybe
 
00:48:27.430 --> 00:48:27.440 align:start position:0%
expand on their license instead of
 
00:48:29.349 --> 00:48:29.359 align:start position:0%
finding out in a year when you get some
 
00:48:31.910 --> 00:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
money for one that we're unhappy and now
 
00:48:33.589 --> 00:48:33.599 align:start position:0%
we have two
 
00:48:35.430 --> 00:48:35.440 align:start position:0%
i i think that would actually be ideal
 
00:48:36.950 --> 00:48:36.960 align:start position:0%
we would love to we would love to work
 
00:48:38.230 --> 00:48:38.240 align:start position:0%
with them on it
 
00:48:39.589 --> 00:48:39.599 align:start position:0%
particularly because i'm if i'm a
 
00:48:41.030 --> 00:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
betting man i bet we don't get it this
 
00:48:42.549 --> 00:48:42.559 align:start position:0%
year either so
 
00:48:42.559 --> 00:48:45.030 align:start position:0%
year either so
absolutely

00:48:45.030 --> 00:48:45.040 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:47.270 align:start position:0%
absolutely
okay

00:48:47.270 --> 00:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:48:51.109 --> 00:48:51.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:52.950 --> 00:48:52.960 align:start position:0%
you're saying that it has to go through
 
00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:54.150 align:start position:0%
you're saying that it has to go through
capital

00:48:54.150 --> 00:48:54.160 align:start position:0%
capital
 
00:48:54.160 --> 00:48:54.950 align:start position:0%
capital
it

00:48:54.950 --> 00:48:54.960 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:48:57.270 --> 00:48:57.280 align:start position:0%
it has it's a it's a very large expense
 
00:48:59.349 --> 00:48:59.359 align:start position:0%
and the odds of anybody adding it to our
 
00:49:01.589 --> 00:49:01.599 align:start position:0%
operating budget are very slim but
 
00:49:03.589 --> 00:49:03.599 align:start position:0%
you know new modules of the erp and
 
00:49:05.030 --> 00:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
things like that are always done through
 
00:49:07.109 --> 00:49:07.119 align:start position:0%
capital yeah i mean what i get what i
 
00:49:08.630 --> 00:49:08.640 align:start position:0%
can do and i don't mean to be smart
 
00:49:12.230 --> 00:49:12.240 align:start position:0%
alecky about this um what i can do is um
 
00:49:14.870 --> 00:49:14.880 align:start position:0%
is that um we'll talk to them and we'll
 
00:49:17.270 --> 00:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
uh all of us will talk to dennis
 
00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:18.470 align:start position:0%
uh all of us will talk to dennis
okay

00:49:18.470 --> 00:49:18.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:49:22.710 --> 00:49:22.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:24.069 --> 00:49:24.079 align:start position:0%
mike my question
 
00:49:27.030 --> 00:49:27.040 align:start position:0%
my next one was on uh 12 and senator
 
00:49:27.040 --> 00:49:28.630 align:start position:0%
my next one was on uh 12 and senator
rosenwald

00:49:28.630 --> 00:49:28.640 align:start position:0%
rosenwald
 
00:49:30.630 --> 00:49:30.640 align:start position:0%
sort of teed it up a little bit
 
00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:31.910 align:start position:0%
sort of teed it up a little bit
um

00:49:31.910 --> 00:49:31.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:35.030 --> 00:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
my challenge is i i work on the low on
 
00:49:36.950 --> 00:49:36.960 align:start position:0%
the rockingham county long-term nursing
 
00:49:40.390 --> 00:49:40.400 align:start position:0%
home and and on division iii and so i'm
 
00:49:43.190 --> 00:49:43.200 align:start position:0%
confused uh because i don't remember in
 
00:49:44.470 --> 00:49:44.480 align:start position:0%
which budget
 
00:49:47.990 --> 00:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
we made a point of adding money for new
 
00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:49.190 align:start position:0%
we made a point of adding money for new
furniture

00:49:49.190 --> 00:49:49.200 align:start position:0%
furniture
 
00:49:51.829 --> 00:49:51.839 align:start position:0%
um what did did we did we not in
 
00:49:54.630 --> 00:49:54.640 align:start position:0%
division three add money specifically
 
00:49:57.589 --> 00:49:57.599 align:start position:0%
for new furniture
 
00:50:01.750 --> 00:50:01.760 align:start position:0%
not in the most recent budget cycle no
 
00:50:02.950 --> 00:50:02.960 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
00:50:05.109 --> 00:50:05.119 align:start position:0%
um i'm just confused then
 
00:50:07.270 --> 00:50:07.280 align:start position:0%
um and then if i could just make an
 
00:50:10.390 --> 00:50:10.400 align:start position:0%
editorial comment on page three
 
00:50:13.589 --> 00:50:13.599 align:start position:0%
sort of in the middle there the phrase
 
00:50:16.470 --> 00:50:16.480 align:start position:0%
reimbursement is typically a fraction of
 
00:50:17.829 --> 00:50:17.839 align:start position:0%
the cost
 
00:50:17.839 --> 00:50:18.470 align:start position:0%
the cost
i

00:50:18.470 --> 00:50:18.480 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:50:20.309 --> 00:50:20.319 align:start position:0%
just being literal everything is a
 
00:50:22.870 --> 00:50:22.880 align:start position:0%
fraction of a cost whether it's greater
 
00:50:24.870 --> 00:50:24.880 align:start position:0%
than 100 percent or lower than 100
 
00:50:27.109 --> 00:50:27.119 align:start position:0%
percent so that phrase means nothing
 
00:50:30.069 --> 00:50:30.079 align:start position:0%
except it frustrates people like me if
 
00:50:32.230 --> 00:50:32.240 align:start position:0%
if if instead of writing that sort of
 
00:50:34.790 --> 00:50:34.800 align:start position:0%
language if you could maybe insert a
 
00:50:34.800 --> 00:50:36.069 align:start position:0%
language if you could maybe insert a
percentage

00:50:36.069 --> 00:50:36.079 align:start position:0%
percentage
 
00:50:37.829 --> 00:50:37.839 align:start position:0%
of course all right so that's just
 
00:50:41.109 --> 00:50:41.119 align:start position:0%
editorial thank you
 
00:50:43.910 --> 00:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
00:50:46.150 --> 00:50:46.160 align:start position:0%
represent or senator d'alessandro thank
 
00:50:48.150 --> 00:50:48.160 align:start position:0%
you mr while they're here what what's
 
00:50:49.990 --> 00:50:50.000 align:start position:0%
the status of
 
00:50:51.829 --> 00:50:51.839 align:start position:0%
the hospital at this point what's the
 
00:50:54.790 --> 00:50:54.800 align:start position:0%
wait list at this at this point in time
 
00:50:56.950 --> 00:50:56.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question so currently
 
00:50:59.030 --> 00:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
our waitlist as of this morning our
 
00:51:02.309 --> 00:51:02.319 align:start position:0%
queue was at 25 patients
 
00:51:05.670 --> 00:51:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:08.870 --> 00:51:08.880 align:start position:0%
let me recover from that answer please
 
00:51:10.390 --> 00:51:10.400 align:start position:0%
it's a tough one
 
00:51:12.390 --> 00:51:12.400 align:start position:0%
and and the the monies that have been
 
00:51:15.910 --> 00:51:15.920 align:start position:0%
appropriated to renovate the building so
 
00:51:19.190 --> 00:51:19.200 align:start position:0%
that we could accommodate more patients
 
00:51:21.589 --> 00:51:21.599 align:start position:0%
where do they stand that was in the last
 
00:51:24.390 --> 00:51:24.400 align:start position:0%
operating budget before this one
 
00:51:26.710 --> 00:51:26.720 align:start position:0%
we put we put 5 million in there for
 
00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:28.630 align:start position:0%
we put we put 5 million in there for
renovations

00:51:28.630 --> 00:51:28.640 align:start position:0%
renovations
 
00:51:30.870 --> 00:51:30.880 align:start position:0%
so we currently have not had the ability
 
00:51:33.430 --> 00:51:33.440 align:start position:0%
to utilize those funds to start
 
00:51:35.349 --> 00:51:35.359 align:start position:0%
renovation projects are you you're
 
00:51:39.990 --> 00:51:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:43.030 --> 00:51:43.040 align:start position:0%
further question about upgrading
 
00:51:45.430 --> 00:51:45.440 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure i understood your answer
 
00:51:45.440 --> 00:51:46.470 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure i understood your answer
okay

00:51:46.470 --> 00:51:46.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:51:47.430 --> 00:51:47.440 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
00:51:47.440 --> 00:51:48.630 align:start position:0%
i mean
to

00:51:48.630 --> 00:51:48.640 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:51:50.950 --> 00:51:50.960 align:start position:0%
senator d'alessandro's question you said
 
00:51:52.630 --> 00:51:52.640 align:start position:0%
you haven't been able to utilize those
 
00:51:54.870 --> 00:51:54.880 align:start position:0%
funds not yet we haven't been able to
 
00:51:58.069 --> 00:51:58.079 align:start position:0%
start renovation projects however the
 
00:52:00.309 --> 00:52:00.319 align:start position:0%
so we do have a unit um that isn't being
 
00:52:03.349 --> 00:52:03.359 align:start position:0%
occupied within enf help but the other
 
00:52:05.349 --> 00:52:05.359 align:start position:0%
half of the unit is being occupied right
 
00:52:08.549 --> 00:52:08.559 align:start position:0%
now by adults and is full
 
00:52:11.349 --> 00:52:11.359 align:start position:0%
this has been a a concern of mine for
 
00:52:13.349 --> 00:52:13.359 align:start position:0%
for years now
 
00:52:15.270 --> 00:52:15.280 align:start position:0%
just one further question what's what's
 
00:52:17.910 --> 00:52:17.920 align:start position:0%
the length of time with the wait list at
 
00:52:19.589 --> 00:52:19.599 align:start position:0%
this point um well
 
00:52:21.030 --> 00:52:21.040 align:start position:0%
through a lot of really great work
 
00:52:23.190 --> 00:52:23.200 align:start position:0%
lately we've been able to get our wait
 
00:52:25.670 --> 00:52:25.680 align:start position:0%
list down um in the past in the two
 
00:52:27.109 --> 00:52:27.119 align:start position:0%
years that i've been there i've seen
 
00:52:29.670 --> 00:52:29.680 align:start position:0%
folks waiting on the list for upwards of
 
00:52:32.069 --> 00:52:32.079 align:start position:0%
two weeks however more recently we've
 
00:52:35.190 --> 00:52:35.200 align:start position:0%
been able to get patients in within um
 
00:52:37.829 --> 00:52:37.839 align:start position:0%
three to i mean sometimes even two but
 
00:52:40.630 --> 00:52:40.640 align:start position:0%
probably two to five days
 
00:52:43.109 --> 00:52:43.119 align:start position:0%
it would further question
 
00:52:43.119 --> 00:52:45.430 align:start position:0%
it would further question
um

00:52:45.430 --> 00:52:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:45.440 --> 00:52:48.470 align:start position:0%
 
it's

00:52:48.470 --> 00:52:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:50.710 --> 00:52:50.720 align:start position:0%
kind of escaped my mind as we as we
 
00:52:52.790 --> 00:52:52.800 align:start position:0%
watch going through this
 
00:52:54.790 --> 00:52:54.800 align:start position:0%
but um yes it
 
00:52:57.910 --> 00:52:57.920 align:start position:0%
if you were able to hire
 
00:53:00.950 --> 00:53:00.960 align:start position:0%
all of the vacancies that you hire i was
 
00:53:03.670 --> 00:53:03.680 align:start position:0%
told by your precursor that we would
 
00:53:05.510 --> 00:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
have no wait list
 
00:53:07.589 --> 00:53:07.599 align:start position:0%
is that still a correct statement yes
 
00:53:09.349 --> 00:53:09.359 align:start position:0%
that's still accurate
 
00:53:15.589 --> 00:53:15.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:18.150 --> 00:53:18.160 align:start position:0%
senator rosenwald thank you
 
00:53:20.470 --> 00:53:20.480 align:start position:0%
when i look at
 
00:53:23.349 --> 00:53:23.359 align:start position:0%
the waitlist data that the department
 
00:53:23.359 --> 00:53:24.470 align:start position:0%
the waitlist data that the department
keeps

00:53:24.470 --> 00:53:24.480 align:start position:0%
keeps
 
00:53:27.670 --> 00:53:27.680 align:start position:0%
sometimes i see that the cypress center
 
00:53:30.230 --> 00:53:30.240 align:start position:0%
has half of its beds
 
00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:31.589 align:start position:0%
has half of its beds
available

00:53:31.589 --> 00:53:31.599 align:start position:0%
available
 
00:53:34.549 --> 00:53:34.559 align:start position:0%
and still we run a wait list of right
 
00:53:37.910 --> 00:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
now it's 25 last week i think it was
 
00:53:41.190 --> 00:53:41.200 align:start position:0%
10 more maybe higher than that
 
00:53:42.390 --> 00:53:42.400 align:start position:0%
why are
 
00:53:45.510 --> 00:53:45.520 align:start position:0%
the those patients not appropriate for
 
00:53:48.390 --> 00:53:48.400 align:start position:0%
the cypress center um
 
00:53:48.400 --> 00:53:49.190 align:start position:0%
the cypress center um
i'm

00:53:49.190 --> 00:53:49.200 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
00:53:51.030 --> 00:53:51.040 align:start position:0%
well i can't i can't speak specifically
 
00:53:53.190 --> 00:53:53.200 align:start position:0%
to cypress center but i think my
 
00:53:55.030 --> 00:53:55.040 align:start position:0%
understanding of what makes it
 
00:53:56.630 --> 00:53:56.640 align:start position:0%
challenging for those other admitting
 
00:53:59.109 --> 00:53:59.119 align:start position:0%
facilities is also a staffing issue so
 
00:54:01.270 --> 00:54:01.280 align:start position:0%
when we see some of their beds come
 
00:54:02.870 --> 00:54:02.880 align:start position:0%
offline it's because they're having
 
00:54:04.470 --> 00:54:04.480 align:start position:0%
staffing challenges that they have to
 
00:54:06.470 --> 00:54:06.480 align:start position:0%
work through before they're able to take
 
00:54:14.230 --> 00:54:14.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:16.710 --> 00:54:16.720 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
00:54:18.790 --> 00:54:18.800 align:start position:0%
representative leishman thanks madam
 
00:54:20.870 --> 00:54:20.880 align:start position:0%
chair i would just wonder if you could
 
00:54:23.109 --> 00:54:23.119 align:start position:0%
tell us why the renovations you said
 
00:54:25.430 --> 00:54:25.440 align:start position:0%
they you haven't gotten to them but why
 
00:54:25.440 --> 00:54:27.190 align:start position:0%
they you haven't gotten to them but why
not

00:54:27.190 --> 00:54:27.200 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:54:29.829 --> 00:54:29.839 align:start position:0%
um well we've had difficulty from a
 
00:54:31.910 --> 00:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
census perspective trying to maintain
 
00:54:33.589 --> 00:54:33.599 align:start position:0%
the balance between
 
00:54:35.349 --> 00:54:35.359 align:start position:0%
admitting in the queue
 
00:54:36.390 --> 00:54:36.400 align:start position:0%
and really
 
00:54:38.150 --> 00:54:38.160 align:start position:0%
making sure that patients are able to
 
00:54:39.589 --> 00:54:39.599 align:start position:0%
get into new hampshire hospital as
 
00:54:41.190 --> 00:54:41.200 align:start position:0%
quickly as possible
 
00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:42.230 align:start position:0%
quickly as possible
while

00:54:42.230 --> 00:54:42.240 align:start position:0%
while
 
00:54:44.150 --> 00:54:44.160 align:start position:0%
then also moving forward with a
 
00:54:45.910 --> 00:54:45.920 align:start position:0%
renovation so we haven't been able to
 
00:54:48.230 --> 00:54:48.240 align:start position:0%
find that balance yet of being able to
 
00:54:50.309 --> 00:54:50.319 align:start position:0%
renovate the unit and still maintain
 
00:54:51.990 --> 00:54:52.000 align:start position:0%
where we need to be from a cue
 
00:55:02.150 --> 00:55:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:04.230 --> 00:55:04.240 align:start position:0%
represent blinn
 
00:55:05.910 --> 00:55:05.920 align:start position:0%
can i just follow up on representative
 
00:55:07.349 --> 00:55:07.359 align:start position:0%
leachman's uh
 
00:55:09.910 --> 00:55:09.920 align:start position:0%
uh question i guess i'm not i'm not sure
 
00:55:12.710 --> 00:55:12.720 align:start position:0%
i understand the connection of
 
00:55:14.230 --> 00:55:14.240 align:start position:0%
i mean i understand the two things that
 
00:55:16.950 --> 00:55:16.960 align:start position:0%
you're talking about but it seems like
 
00:55:19.030 --> 00:55:19.040 align:start position:0%
the people who would
 
00:55:20.549 --> 00:55:20.559 align:start position:0%
would be you know
 
00:55:22.950 --> 00:55:22.960 align:start position:0%
doing the work to
 
00:55:25.510 --> 00:55:25.520 align:start position:0%
get a renovation in place would be
 
00:55:25.520 --> 00:55:26.630 align:start position:0%
get a renovation in place would be
different

00:55:26.630 --> 00:55:26.640 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:55:28.630 --> 00:55:28.640 align:start position:0%
from the people who would be trying to
 
00:55:31.910 --> 00:55:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:33.750 --> 00:55:33.760 align:start position:0%
make sure that there are
 
00:55:35.829 --> 00:55:35.839 align:start position:0%
make sure that people are getting that
 
00:55:37.910 --> 00:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
for the facilities that are currently
 
00:55:40.230 --> 00:55:40.240 align:start position:0%
available people are getting in
 
00:55:43.270 --> 00:55:43.280 align:start position:0%
as quickly as possible i mean i
 
00:55:45.430 --> 00:55:45.440 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm i guess i'm not sure i see
 
00:55:46.789 --> 00:55:46.799 align:start position:0%
the connection between those two and i'm
 
00:55:47.990 --> 00:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
wondering if you could elaborate a
 
00:55:49.109 --> 00:55:49.119 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
00:55:52.150 --> 00:55:52.160 align:start position:0%
um sure i can i can give it a try it's
 
00:55:52.160 --> 00:55:53.190 align:start position:0%
um sure i can i can give it a try it's
really

00:55:53.190 --> 00:55:53.200 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:55:57.109 --> 00:55:57.119 align:start position:0%
about capacity and if we are
 
00:55:59.109 --> 00:55:59.119 align:start position:0%
taking a unit offline to be able to
 
00:56:01.430 --> 00:56:01.440 align:start position:0%
perform the renovation then we
 
00:56:03.990 --> 00:56:04.000 align:start position:0%
are taking beds offline that currently
 
00:56:07.990 --> 00:56:08.000 align:start position:0%
are being filled and occupied by adults
 
00:56:09.750 --> 00:56:09.760 align:start position:0%
okay i'm sorry i thought you had said
 
00:56:11.589 --> 00:56:11.599 align:start position:0%
earlier that there was a unit that was
 
00:56:11.599 --> 00:56:12.390 align:start position:0%
earlier that there was a unit that was
not

00:56:12.390 --> 00:56:12.400 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:56:14.549 --> 00:56:14.559 align:start position:0%
being used and i guess i was just sort
 
00:56:15.990 --> 00:56:16.000 align:start position:0%
of assuming that that would be one of
 
00:56:17.589 --> 00:56:17.599 align:start position:0%
the places where the renovations were
 
00:56:19.829 --> 00:56:19.839 align:start position:0%
made and if if that sounds like that
 
00:56:21.910 --> 00:56:21.920 align:start position:0%
assumption was incorrect
 
00:56:23.670 --> 00:56:23.680 align:start position:0%
we do have a unit offline and that's due
 
00:56:26.950 --> 00:56:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:26.960 --> 00:56:27.829 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:56:27.829 --> 00:56:27.839 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:56:29.190 --> 00:56:29.200 align:start position:0%
which might
 
00:56:30.870 --> 00:56:30.880 align:start position:0%
again might suggest to me that maybe
 
00:56:32.710 --> 00:56:32.720 align:start position:0%
since that you can't staff that that
 
00:56:34.549 --> 00:56:34.559 align:start position:0%
that might be the place where somebody
 
00:56:37.109 --> 00:56:37.119 align:start position:0%
who knew about renovations would be
 
00:56:38.630 --> 00:56:38.640 align:start position:0%
doing the renovations
 
00:56:40.069 --> 00:56:40.079 align:start position:0%
so i can take that back to the
 
00:56:41.750 --> 00:56:41.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner and talk a little bit more
 
00:56:45.270 --> 00:56:45.280 align:start position:0%
about the status of that project
 
00:56:47.109 --> 00:56:47.119 align:start position:0%
you know i think any renovation project
 
00:56:48.710 --> 00:56:48.720 align:start position:0%
new hampshire hospital would be very
 
00:56:50.710 --> 00:56:50.720 align:start position:0%
grateful for and as of right now we just
 
00:56:52.390 --> 00:56:52.400 align:start position:0%
haven't been able to find that balance
 
00:56:54.630 --> 00:56:54.640 align:start position:0%
with the q management
 
00:56:58.390 --> 00:56:58.400 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much
 
00:57:01.910 --> 00:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:05.270 --> 00:57:05.280 align:start position:0%
i do have oh yes go ahead
 
00:57:06.630 --> 00:57:06.640 align:start position:0%
part of what we
 
00:57:07.910 --> 00:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
did in the
 
00:57:10.069 --> 00:57:10.079 align:start position:0%
budget a few years ago
 
00:57:13.510 --> 00:57:13.520 align:start position:0%
was not only to fund renovations of
 
00:57:16.150 --> 00:57:16.160 align:start position:0%
that unit but also to increase
 
00:57:16.160 --> 00:57:17.589 align:start position:0%
that unit but also to increase
transitional

00:57:17.589 --> 00:57:17.599 align:start position:0%

the status of those transitional beds
 
00:57:30.069 --> 00:57:30.079 align:start position:0%
across the state i know we opened the

ones at philbrook
 
00:57:32.319 --> 00:57:33.190 align:start position:0%

00:57:36.150 --> 00:57:36.160 align:start position:0%
have we funded all of the
 
00:57:40.870 --> 00:57:40.880 align:start position:0%
i think 30 or 40 beds that we funded
 
00:57:40.880 --> 00:57:41.750 align:start position:0%
i think 30 or 40 beds that we funded

funding
 
00:58:29.829 --> 00:58:29.839 align:start position:0%
that was afforded to the department for
 
00:58:31.510 --> 00:58:31.520 align:start position:0%
that purpose
 
00:58:33.829 --> 00:58:33.839 align:start position:0%

00:58:55.190 --> 00:58:55.200 align:start position:0%
one other question i have
 
00:58:59.109 --> 00:58:59.119 align:start position:0%
and that is the five million
 
00:58:59.119 --> 00:59:00.230 align:start position:0%
and that is the five million
i

00:59:00.230 --> 00:59:00.240 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:59:03.430 --> 00:59:03.440 align:start position:0%
was that out of capital or was that out
 
00:59:03.440 --> 00:59:04.789 align:start position:0%
was that out of capital or was that out
of

00:59:04.789 --> 00:59:04.799 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:59:08.870 --> 00:59:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:08.880 --> 00:59:09.910 align:start position:0%
 
the

00:59:09.910 --> 00:59:09.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:59:11.990 --> 00:59:12.000 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry the 5 million in
 
00:59:13.829 --> 00:59:13.839 align:start position:0%
relative to this item
 
00:59:20.309 --> 00:59:20.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:22.309 --> 00:59:22.319 align:start position:0%
it was general funds okay the the
 
00:59:25.510 --> 00:59:25.520 align:start position:0%
renovation of the unit yeah yes okay
 
00:59:28.309 --> 00:59:28.319 align:start position:0%
so we have
 
00:59:33.829 --> 00:59:33.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:36.470 --> 00:59:36.480 align:start position:0%
so we best get moving
 
00:59:39.190 --> 00:59:39.200 align:start position:0%
we we have um begun all of the design
 
00:59:42.950 --> 00:59:42.960 align:start position:0%
work around those projects so we we um
 
00:59:44.150 --> 00:59:44.160 align:start position:0%
although the construction hasn't
 
00:59:45.910 --> 00:59:45.920 align:start position:0%
necessarily started a lot of the design
 
00:59:48.069 --> 00:59:48.079 align:start position:0%
and architectural work has has begun and
 
00:59:51.910 --> 00:59:51.920 align:start position:0%
connects well thank you but you need to
 
00:59:54.069 --> 00:59:54.079 align:start position:0%
you need to get to the construction so
 
00:59:56.789 --> 00:59:56.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:58.470 --> 00:59:58.480 align:start position:0%
save it off for
 
01:00:00.069 --> 01:00:00.079 align:start position:0%
the next budget because i don't want
 
01:00:01.910 --> 01:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
that to lapse
 
01:00:05.030 --> 01:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
you know understood
 
01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:06.150 align:start position:0%
you know understood
okay

01:00:06.150 --> 01:00:06.160 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:00:07.910 --> 01:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
all right are there any further
 
01:00:10.789 --> 01:00:10.799 align:start position:0%
questions on um
 
01:00:12.950 --> 01:00:12.960 align:start position:0%
this particular item
 
01:00:14.710 --> 01:00:14.720 align:start position:0%
i know we kind of
 
01:00:17.430 --> 01:00:17.440 align:start position:0%
went all over the place but uh
 
01:00:19.750 --> 01:00:19.760 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
01:00:21.270 --> 01:00:21.280 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure
 
01:00:23.190 --> 01:00:23.200 align:start position:0%
it's been a long time since we've had
 
01:00:24.549 --> 01:00:24.559 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
01:00:27.510 --> 01:00:27.520 align:start position:0%
the hospital in to talk to us so
 
01:00:31.349 --> 01:00:31.359 align:start position:0%
we probably had a lot of questions that
 
01:00:31.359 --> 01:00:33.670 align:start position:0%
we probably had a lot of questions that
yes

01:00:33.670 --> 01:00:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:35.510 --> 01:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
did you have another question uh yes
 
01:00:38.710 --> 01:00:38.720 align:start position:0%
please okay uh item 10 uh just caught my
 
01:00:41.109 --> 01:00:41.119 align:start position:0%
eye as you were talking
 
01:00:42.870 --> 01:00:42.880 align:start position:0%
it looks like we're going to spend money
 
01:00:45.990 --> 01:00:46.000 align:start position:0%
on uh improving signage to make them ada
 
01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:47.190 align:start position:0%
on uh improving signage to make them ada
compliant

01:00:47.190 --> 01:00:47.200 align:start position:0%
compliant
 
01:00:50.150 --> 01:00:50.160 align:start position:0%
um given that we're building a uh a new
 
01:00:52.710 --> 01:00:52.720 align:start position:0%
facility is this just wasted money i
 
01:00:55.589 --> 01:00:55.599 align:start position:0%
mean it it brings us to into compliance
 
01:00:55.599 --> 01:00:56.390 align:start position:0%
mean it it brings us to into compliance
for

01:00:56.390 --> 01:00:56.400 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:00:59.349 --> 01:00:59.359 align:start position:0%
a few months but but signage is unique
 
01:01:01.589 --> 01:01:01.599 align:start position:0%
to the structure so i'm just wondering
 
01:01:03.990 --> 01:01:04.000 align:start position:0%
if this is a waste of money thank you
 
01:01:06.549 --> 01:01:06.559 align:start position:0%
for the question um so no
 
01:01:08.630 --> 01:01:08.640 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't be a waste and really the
 
01:01:10.309 --> 01:01:10.319 align:start position:0%
current signage within new hampshire
 
01:01:10.319 --> 01:01:11.349 align:start position:0%
current signage within new hampshire
hospital

01:01:11.349 --> 01:01:11.359 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
01:01:13.670 --> 01:01:13.680 align:start position:0%
is not sufficient to even our current
 
01:01:15.510 --> 01:01:15.520 align:start position:0%
state we still have signage within the
 
01:01:17.109 --> 01:01:17.119 align:start position:0%
facility that refers to the anna
 
01:01:18.630 --> 01:01:18.640 align:start position:0%
philbrook center
 
01:01:20.309 --> 01:01:20.319 align:start position:0%
that used to reside within new hampshire
 
01:01:22.470 --> 01:01:22.480 align:start position:0%
hospital so it's greatly needed
 
01:01:25.190 --> 01:01:25.200 align:start position:0%
throughout the facility and then
 
01:01:27.750 --> 01:01:27.760 align:start position:0%
signage that is specific to the forensic
 
01:01:29.589 --> 01:01:29.599 align:start position:0%
portion of the hospital would be
 
01:01:32.309 --> 01:01:32.319 align:start position:0%
incorporated within the construction and
 
01:01:38.309 --> 01:01:38.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:42.069 --> 01:01:42.079 align:start position:0%

01:04:08.950 --> 01:04:08.960 align:start position:0%
so so this this is a bit of a unique
 
01:04:10.710 --> 01:04:10.720 align:start position:0%
scenario where
 
01:04:13.190 --> 01:04:13.200 align:start position:0%
the the prescription drug monitoring
 
01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:14.230 align:start position:0%
the the prescription drug monitoring
program

01:04:14.230 --> 01:04:14.240 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:04:16.309 --> 01:04:16.319 align:start position:0%
was transferred over to the department
 
01:04:17.910 --> 01:04:17.920 align:start position:0%
of health and human services during the
 
01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:18.950 align:start position:0%
of health and human services during the
budget

01:04:18.950 --> 01:04:18.960 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:04:21.750 --> 01:04:21.760 align:start position:0%
um the the second year
 
01:04:24.470 --> 01:04:24.480 align:start position:0%
uh was not budgeted uh completely it was
 
01:04:27.589 --> 01:04:27.599 align:start position:0%
only budgeted at 255 000
 
01:04:30.230 --> 01:04:30.240 align:start position:0%
um and what we're seeking to do here is
 
01:04:32.630 --> 01:04:32.640 align:start position:0%
the we're seeking to sure up the entire
 
01:04:34.390 --> 01:04:34.400 align:start position:0%
budget for the full state fiscal year
 
01:04:36.069 --> 01:04:36.079 align:start position:0%
similar to what we would do
 
01:04:37.349 --> 01:04:37.359 align:start position:0%
throughout throughout the course of the
 
01:04:39.589 --> 01:04:39.599 align:start position:0%
normal budget process
 
01:04:41.829 --> 01:04:41.839 align:start position:0%
i can't really speak to why the original
 
01:04:44.789 --> 01:04:44.799 align:start position:0%
budget was only 255 000 and not the not
 
01:04:45.750 --> 01:04:45.760 align:start position:0%
the full
 
01:04:51.190 --> 01:04:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:53.750 --> 01:04:53.760 align:start position:0%
so if i could man i'm cheering if if i'm
 
01:04:55.109 --> 01:04:55.119 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
01:04:58.309 --> 01:04:58.319 align:start position:0%
there is a surveillance prevention
 
01:05:02.390 --> 01:05:02.400 align:start position:0%
and it's like 3.6 and again
 
01:05:04.789 --> 01:05:04.799 align:start position:0%
you're only requesting 1.2 with the
 
01:05:08.470 --> 01:05:08.480 align:start position:0%
request so i'm still not quite
 
01:05:13.270 --> 01:05:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:15.670 --> 01:05:15.680 align:start position:0%
sure sure um
 
01:05:18.309 --> 01:05:18.319 align:start position:0%
so so so just from uh
 
01:05:19.910 --> 01:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
maybe it helps us to kind of almost take
 
01:05:22.230 --> 01:05:22.240 align:start position:0%
a further step back so for state fiscal
 
01:05:24.390 --> 01:05:24.400 align:start position:0%
year 2022
 
01:05:27.349 --> 01:05:27.359 align:start position:0%
for this program we received the the
 
01:05:30.549 --> 01:05:30.559 align:start position:0%
budget was appropriate and it was full
 
01:05:32.470 --> 01:05:32.480 align:start position:0%
what what we're seeking to do here is
 
01:05:34.549 --> 01:05:34.559 align:start position:0%
add the additional one point
 
01:05:36.630 --> 01:05:36.640 align:start position:0%
1.2 million dollars here
 
01:05:39.190 --> 01:05:39.200 align:start position:0%
to to make the the budget for state
 
01:05:41.670 --> 01:05:41.680 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 2023 what it should have
 
01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:42.470 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 2023 what it should have
been

01:05:42.470 --> 01:05:42.480 align:start position:0%
been
 
01:05:44.710 --> 01:05:44.720 align:start position:0%
in the original budget
 
01:05:47.109 --> 01:05:47.119 align:start position:0%
we received the budget from oplc it was
 
01:05:48.789 --> 01:05:48.799 align:start position:0%
transferred over during the budget
 
01:05:51.589 --> 01:05:51.599 align:start position:0%
process and and it was not completely
 
01:05:51.599 --> 01:05:55.190 align:start position:0%
process and and it was not completely
funded

01:05:55.190 --> 01:05:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:56.950 --> 01:05:56.960 align:start position:0%
i i guess i'm still
 
01:05:59.589 --> 01:05:59.599 align:start position:0%
i had a loss of madam chair but okay i
 
01:06:01.430 --> 01:06:01.440 align:start position:0%

01:06:13.510 --> 01:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
june 30th of 23. so that's that's what
 
01:06:15.029 --> 01:06:15.039 align:start position:0%
caught my attention understood i
 
01:06:17.910 --> 01:06:17.920 align:start position:0%
apologize uh representative leishman yes
 
01:06:21.270 --> 01:06:21.280 align:start position:0%
so we we have received notice um from
 
01:06:23.190 --> 01:06:23.200 align:start position:0%
from the federal awarding agency that we
 
01:06:26.230 --> 01:06:26.240 align:start position:0%
will be receiving the second award here
 
01:06:28.870 --> 01:06:28.880 align:start position:0%
uh it should be happening next month uh
 
01:06:31.270 --> 01:06:31.280 align:start position:0%
if not in july you're referring to the
 
01:06:34.309 --> 01:06:34.319 align:start position:0%
award that that ends in august included
 
01:06:36.230 --> 01:06:36.240 align:start position:0%

request yes yeah and that other award
 
01:06:40.150 --> 01:06:40.160 align:start position:0%
will be coming so what what we're
 
01:06:42.470 --> 01:06:42.480 align:start position:0%
seeking to do here is is following the
 
01:06:43.910 --> 01:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
same approach that we would follow
 
01:06:46.390 --> 01:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
during the budget where we would budget
 
01:06:49.029 --> 01:06:49.039 align:start position:0%
the the appropriate amount um for the
 
01:06:51.029 --> 01:06:51.039 align:start position:0%
year and then we would receive those
 
01:06:52.710 --> 01:06:52.720 align:start position:0%
funds at a later date
 
01:06:54.150 --> 01:06:54.160 align:start position:0%

june 2022
 
01:08:28.159 --> 01:08:29.110 align:start position:0%
june 2022
so

01:08:29.110 --> 01:08:29.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:08:30.630 --> 01:08:30.640 align:start position:0%
i am
 
01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:31.669 align:start position:0%
i am
not

01:08:31.669 --> 01:08:31.679 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:08:34.950 --> 01:08:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:36.789 --> 01:08:36.799 align:start position:0%
think about those
 
01:08:39.910 --> 01:08:39.920 align:start position:0%
i'm asking you to think about how you're
 
01:08:44.789 --> 01:08:44.799 align:start position:0%
going to do that in the next 45 days
 
01:08:44.799 --> 01:08:45.990 align:start position:0%

okay
so

01:08:48.070 --> 01:08:48.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:08:52.070 --> 01:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
because there were a lot of requests
 
01:08:54.229 --> 01:08:54.239 align:start position:0%

01:08:58.149 --> 01:08:58.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:09:00.309 --> 01:09:00.319 align:start position:0%

01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:34.229 align:start position:0%
the state
so

01:10:34.229 --> 01:10:34.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:10:36.630 --> 01:10:36.640 align:start position:0%
some people with disabilities would get
 
01:10:38.630 --> 01:10:38.640 align:start position:0%
support from the area agency but the
 
01:10:40.229 --> 01:10:40.239 align:start position:0%
service links
 
01:10:42.070 --> 01:10:42.080 align:start position:0%
or their managed care organizations or
 
01:10:44.870 --> 01:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
whoever is serving them but the service
 
01:10:47.510 --> 01:10:47.520 align:start position:0%
links serve a broad range of individuals
 
01:10:50.149 --> 01:10:50.159 align:start position:0%
and families with disabilities um
 
01:10:52.709 --> 01:10:52.719 align:start position:0%
and who are aging there's about 70 000
 
01:10:54.229 --> 01:10:54.239 align:start position:0%
people a year so this is really
 
01:10:54.239 --> 01:10:55.750 align:start position:0%
people a year so this is really
broad-based

01:10:55.750 --> 01:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
broad-based
 
01:10:58.870 --> 01:10:58.880 align:start position:0%
across the community for those seniors
 
01:11:01.030 --> 01:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
that do not have the support of another
 
01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:04.709 align:start position:0%
that do not have the support of another
organization

01:11:04.709 --> 01:11:04.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:08.630 --> 01:11:08.640 align:start position:0%

01:12:17.350 --> 01:12:17.360 align:start position:0%
i man i'm sure yes i i think edwards i
 
01:12:20.870 --> 01:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
think what we wanted to do in pre-fiscal
 
01:12:25.189 --> 01:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
was just uh just to hear the dialogue on
 
01:12:27.430 --> 01:12:27.440 align:start position:0%
the process of how we received this
 
01:12:30.950 --> 01:12:30.960 align:start position:0%
money how we got the profit and and how
 
01:12:33.030 --> 01:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
we're teeing it up for reuse in a
 
01:12:35.910 --> 01:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
subsequent time frame i i think we
 
01:12:37.669 --> 01:12:37.679 align:start position:0%
wanted the story
 
01:12:37.679 --> 01:12:38.470 align:start position:0%
wanted the story
yes

01:12:38.470 --> 01:12:38.480 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:12:44.149 --> 01:12:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:45.750 --> 01:12:45.760 align:start position:0%
good morning uh for the record my name
 
01:12:47.350 --> 01:12:47.360 align:start position:0%
is ian watt i'm the deputy director for
 
01:12:49.350 --> 01:12:49.360 align:start position:0%
the division of public health services
 
01:12:52.149 --> 01:12:52.159 align:start position:0%
so when we had initially requested
 
01:12:54.790 --> 01:12:54.800 align:start position:0%
funding for this item we
 
01:12:56.550 --> 01:12:56.560 align:start position:0%
were in the middle of the omicron surge
 
01:13:00.149 --> 01:13:00.159 align:start position:0%
this winter and had worked with a vendor
 
01:13:01.270 --> 01:13:01.280 align:start position:0%
and a series of vendors there was a
 
01:13:02.790 --> 01:13:02.800 align:start position:0%
competitive bid to
 
01:13:05.750 --> 01:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
obtain antigen tests for sale at the new
 
01:13:07.510 --> 01:13:07.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire liquor stores
 
01:13:09.830 --> 01:13:09.840 align:start position:0%
we had anticipated being able to sell
 
01:13:11.350 --> 01:13:11.360 align:start position:0%
all of the tests in the liquor stores
 
01:13:13.750 --> 01:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
there was an immense shortage nationally
 
01:13:15.189 --> 01:13:15.199 align:start position:0%
and in the state they weren't available
 
01:13:16.550 --> 01:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
anywhere at the time
 
01:13:18.790 --> 01:13:18.800 align:start position:0%
we actually initially wanted a smaller
 
01:13:20.709 --> 01:13:20.719 align:start position:0%
uh procurement but we weren't able to
 
01:13:22.070 --> 01:13:22.080 align:start position:0%
get a competitive bid for a smaller
 
01:13:23.270 --> 01:13:23.280 align:start position:0%
number which is why we were able to
 
01:13:25.910 --> 01:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
procure or ultimately procure a million
 
01:13:29.030 --> 01:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
tests uh those tests have been for sale
 
01:13:32.149 --> 01:13:32.159 align:start position:0%
since january in the liquor stores what
 
01:13:34.709 --> 01:13:34.719 align:start position:0%
happened was simultaneous to the award
 
01:13:36.870 --> 01:13:36.880 align:start position:0%
and receipt of those tests there was a
 
01:13:39.270 --> 01:13:39.280 align:start position:0%
confluence of a few events first of all
 
01:13:41.669 --> 01:13:41.679 align:start position:0%
the federal government initiated their
 
01:13:43.990 --> 01:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
free to your front door test program
 
01:13:45.990 --> 01:13:46.000 align:start position:0%
which was good news for people's front
 
01:13:47.590 --> 01:13:47.600 align:start position:0%
door but not good news for demand for
 
01:13:50.229 --> 01:13:50.239 align:start position:0%
these tests uh there was also a shoring
 
01:13:52.149 --> 01:13:52.159 align:start position:0%
up of the national uh supply chain and
 
01:13:54.229 --> 01:13:54.239 align:start position:0%
tests so they became available at big
 
01:13:55.990 --> 01:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
box stores and retailers and pharmacies
 
01:13:57.590 --> 01:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
where they weren't otherwise so as a
 
01:13:59.510 --> 01:13:59.520 align:start position:0%
result we did not see the demand that we
 
01:14:01.830 --> 01:14:01.840 align:start position:0%
were anticipating
 
01:14:03.030 --> 01:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
the tests have been on sale at the
 
01:14:05.350 --> 01:14:05.360 align:start position:0%
liquor commission since since january
 
01:14:07.430 --> 01:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
and as a result we're looking to
 
01:14:08.870 --> 01:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
reallocate and reappropriate some of
 
01:14:11.270 --> 01:14:11.280 align:start position:0%
those resources to other known audiences
 
01:14:12.630 --> 01:14:12.640 align:start position:0%
that have demand that we've been
 
01:14:15.110 --> 01:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
providing tests to uh to support their
 
01:14:21.189 --> 01:14:21.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:23.990 --> 01:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
uh yes representative edwards
 
01:14:25.910 --> 01:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the
 
01:14:28.790 --> 01:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
explanation i i'm just curious as you're
 
01:14:30.950 --> 01:14:30.960 align:start position:0%
looking at other potential buyers for
 
01:14:33.350 --> 01:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
the excess inventory that we have
 
01:14:35.830 --> 01:14:35.840 align:start position:0%
um could you could you like tick off a
 
01:14:37.590 --> 01:14:37.600 align:start position:0%
few of them um
 
01:14:39.669 --> 01:14:39.679 align:start position:0%
i i'm just i just want to make sure that
 
01:14:43.669 --> 01:14:43.679 align:start position:0%
we aren't um disposing of them or
 
01:14:46.550 --> 01:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
reselling them to some nerdy well
 
01:14:46.560 --> 01:14:48.070 align:start position:0%
reselling them to some nerdy well
organization

01:14:48.070 --> 01:14:48.080 align:start position:0%
organization
 
01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:48.870 align:start position:0%
organization
so

01:14:48.870 --> 01:14:48.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:14:50.470 --> 01:14:50.480 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the question so the
 
01:14:52.790 --> 01:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
intent is actually not to uh sell the
 
01:14:54.950 --> 01:14:54.960 align:start position:0%
items the intent is to use them for some
 
01:14:56.390 --> 01:14:56.400 align:start position:0%
of our audiences to whom we've been
 
01:14:58.229 --> 01:14:58.239 align:start position:0%
providing tests
 
01:14:59.510 --> 01:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
for public health
 
01:15:01.350 --> 01:15:01.360 align:start position:0%
and safety reasons so the audiences that
 
01:15:03.510 --> 01:15:03.520 align:start position:0%
we're proposing as are noted in the
 
01:15:04.870 --> 01:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
letter are
 
01:15:07.590 --> 01:15:07.600 align:start position:0%
federally qualified health centers fqhcs
 
01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:08.870 align:start position:0%
federally qualified health centers fqhcs
hospitals

01:15:08.870 --> 01:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
hospitals
 
01:15:11.189 --> 01:15:11.199 align:start position:0%
camps to ensure the safe operation of
 
01:15:13.990 --> 01:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
camps this summer our schools as well as
 
01:15:15.510 --> 01:15:15.520 align:start position:0%
the public health networks who support
 
01:15:17.510 --> 01:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
first responders and others so these are
 
01:15:19.110 --> 01:15:19.120 align:start position:0%
audiences that we the state have been
 
01:15:22.870 --> 01:15:22.880 align:start position:0%
providing these antigen tests to um via
 
01:15:24.790 --> 01:15:24.800 align:start position:0%
via federal allocation and other funding
 
01:15:26.470 --> 01:15:26.480 align:start position:0%
sources so the intent would be to
 
01:15:29.350 --> 01:15:29.360 align:start position:0%
repurpose these uh for a known need uh
 
01:15:31.110 --> 01:15:31.120 align:start position:0%
that we have and have been providing
 
01:15:33.110 --> 01:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
throughout the pandemic
 
01:15:35.189 --> 01:15:35.199 align:start position:0%
so one other yes following
 
01:15:38.790 --> 01:15:38.800 align:start position:0%
so um i i i heard the confluence of
 
01:15:41.350 --> 01:15:41.360 align:start position:0%
events and i understand all that i i
 
01:15:43.110 --> 01:15:43.120 align:start position:0%
just wondering if in
 
01:15:45.830 --> 01:15:45.840 align:start position:0%
retrospect if you think
 
01:15:48.229 --> 01:15:48.239 align:start position:0%
that we uh that there was anything
 
01:15:50.149 --> 01:15:50.159 align:start position:0%
fundamentally wrong with our estimation
 
01:15:52.709 --> 01:15:52.719 align:start position:0%
process to begin with or just stuff
 
01:15:52.719 --> 01:15:53.990 align:start position:0%
process to begin with or just stuff
happened

01:15:53.990 --> 01:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
happened
 
01:15:55.910 --> 01:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
yeah i think it's a good question thank
 
01:15:55.920 --> 01:15:56.950 align:start position:0%
yeah i think it's a good question thank
you

01:15:56.950 --> 01:15:56.960 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:15:58.950 --> 01:15:58.960 align:start position:0%
you know we
 
01:16:00.550 --> 01:16:00.560 align:start position:0%
hindsight has been very valuable
 
01:16:03.189 --> 01:16:03.199 align:start position:0%
throughout the pandemic as we know um we
 
01:16:05.270 --> 01:16:05.280 align:start position:0%
at the time did have the question both
 
01:16:07.270 --> 01:16:07.280 align:start position:0%
internally and and i believe even from
 
01:16:09.030 --> 01:16:09.040 align:start position:0%
this committee of if a smaller number
 
01:16:10.550 --> 01:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
would make more sense as a starting
 
01:16:12.790 --> 01:16:12.800 align:start position:0%
point what we found when we went out to
 
01:16:14.149 --> 01:16:14.159 align:start position:0%
the vendor community is that no one
 
01:16:16.070 --> 01:16:16.080 align:start position:0%
would entertain a smaller number and
 
01:16:18.070 --> 01:16:18.080 align:start position:0%
that was because the competition was not
 
01:16:20.870 --> 01:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
just our state many states and other big
 
01:16:22.390 --> 01:16:22.400 align:start position:0%
corporate entities that we're trying to
 
01:16:24.470 --> 01:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
procure for them their own sake um you
 
01:16:26.470 --> 01:16:26.480 align:start position:0%
know again competition has been been
 
01:16:28.790 --> 01:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
fierce and when that's been fierce um
 
01:16:30.950 --> 01:16:30.960 align:start position:0%
you know vendors have been able to to
 
01:16:32.790 --> 01:16:32.800 align:start position:0%
leverage to to turn to the numbers they
 
01:16:32.800 --> 01:16:33.590 align:start position:0%
leverage to to turn to the numbers they
want

01:16:33.590 --> 01:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
want
 
01:16:36.310 --> 01:16:36.320 align:start position:0%
so we picked a number that we thought
 
01:16:39.030 --> 01:16:39.040 align:start position:0%
and do still see demand for it just
 
01:16:41.189 --> 01:16:41.199 align:start position:0%
didn't didn't materialize in the liquor
 
01:16:41.199 --> 01:16:44.310 align:start position:0%
didn't didn't materialize in the liquor
stores

01:16:44.310 --> 01:16:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:46.790 --> 01:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
01:16:48.790 --> 01:16:48.800 align:start position:0%

always uh just wanted an update on the
 
01:22:06.070 --> 01:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
hatcheries what's going on there how
 
01:22:08.709 --> 01:22:08.719 align:start position:0%
many hatcheries are we going to save
 
01:22:11.189 --> 01:22:11.199 align:start position:0%
and how we gonna do it
 
01:22:12.870 --> 01:22:12.880 align:start position:0%
well we have uh
 
01:22:15.189 --> 01:22:15.199 align:start position:0%
a plot we received the 55 million for
 
01:22:17.750 --> 01:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
money uh we are currently
 
01:22:20.149 --> 01:22:20.159 align:start position:0%
working with hdr they're an engineering
 
01:22:22.310 --> 01:22:22.320 align:start position:0%
firm and we're going through a study
 
01:22:24.709 --> 01:22:24.719 align:start position:0%
process and looking at our hatcheries
 
01:22:26.950 --> 01:22:26.960 align:start position:0%
trying to inventory resources to make
 
01:22:28.229 --> 01:22:28.239 align:start position:0%
that decision
 
01:22:30.149 --> 01:22:30.159 align:start position:0%
on exactly how many we'll keep and where
 
01:22:32.310 --> 01:22:32.320 align:start position:0%
they'll be
 
01:22:34.310 --> 01:22:34.320 align:start position:0%
for the question and what will we have
 
01:22:35.669 --> 01:22:35.679 align:start position:0%
with the answer
 
01:22:38.390 --> 01:22:38.400 align:start position:0%
um we should we're hopefully going to be
 
01:22:42.550 --> 01:22:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:43.910 --> 01:22:43.920 align:start position:0%
the completed
 
01:22:46.229 --> 01:22:46.239 align:start position:0%
study won't be done until december but
 
01:22:47.590 --> 01:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
we do believe we're going to be able to
 
01:22:49.590 --> 01:22:49.600 align:start position:0%
identify assets that we could begin the
 
01:22:53.030 --> 01:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
process of designing um replacement
 
01:22:55.430 --> 01:22:55.440 align:start position:0%
hatcheries in those locations
 
01:22:56.870 --> 01:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
prior to that
 
01:22:56.880 --> 01:22:57.590 align:start position:0%
prior to that
it

01:22:57.590 --> 01:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:23:01.270 --> 01:23:01.280 align:start position:0%
went for the question now how about uh
 
01:23:02.950 --> 01:23:02.960 align:start position:0%
the production of the hatcheries for
 
01:23:05.110 --> 01:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
this for this season people love fishing
 
01:23:07.669 --> 01:23:07.679 align:start position:0%
licenses want to know if stocking is
 
01:23:09.590 --> 01:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
going to take place is that going to
 
01:23:10.790 --> 01:23:10.800 align:start position:0%
take place
 
01:23:13.590 --> 01:23:13.600 align:start position:0%
our goal um our goal is to try to
 
01:23:15.750 --> 01:23:15.760 align:start position:0%
maintain production as best we can
 
01:23:17.830 --> 01:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
through the construction process
 
01:23:19.510 --> 01:23:19.520 align:start position:0%
um we
 
01:23:21.350 --> 01:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
will probably be staggering our
 
01:23:24.470 --> 01:23:24.480 align:start position:0%
construction so that uh we can try to
 
01:23:26.550 --> 01:23:26.560 align:start position:0%
maintain you know maybe beef up a little
 
01:23:27.830 --> 01:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
bit of extra production at some of the
 
01:23:29.510 --> 01:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
other hatcheries while we're working on
 
01:23:32.709 --> 01:23:32.719 align:start position:0%
on one on the hatchery we're working on
 
01:23:33.590 --> 01:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:23:35.590 --> 01:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you but but there's no
 
01:23:40.149 --> 01:23:40.159 align:start position:0%
effect on fit there's no effect on fish
 
01:23:43.110 --> 01:23:43.120 align:start position:0%
those who have bought licenses obviously
 
01:23:45.270 --> 01:23:45.280 align:start position:0%
but but there's no no effect this year
 
01:23:49.590 --> 01:23:49.600 align:start position:0%
there'll be no effect this year um

um just just a moment
 
01:29:00.470 --> 01:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:02.870 --> 01:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
good morning again
 
01:29:06.149 --> 01:29:06.159 align:start position:0%
go ahead so so i'll admit that given
 
01:29:08.149 --> 01:29:08.159 align:start position:0%
that this was a late breaking item i've
 
01:29:10.390 --> 01:29:10.400 align:start position:0%
not read it and so
 
01:29:13.430 --> 01:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
what i'd appreciate mr gilley doing is
 
01:29:15.430 --> 01:29:15.440 align:start position:0%
just walking us through what this
 
01:29:17.590 --> 01:29:17.600 align:start position:0%
request is and and why we're receiving
 
01:29:19.270 --> 01:29:19.280 align:start position:0%
it now
 
01:29:20.310 --> 01:29:20.320 align:start position:0%
sure thing
 
01:29:20.320 --> 01:29:21.350 align:start position:0%
sure thing
um

01:29:21.350 --> 01:29:21.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:23.830 --> 01:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
so this was this request was driven by a
 
01:29:26.709 --> 01:29:26.719 align:start position:0%
couple of a couple of things one one was
 
01:29:26.719 --> 01:29:27.990 align:start position:0%
couple of a couple of things one one was
that

01:29:27.990 --> 01:29:28.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:29:29.270 --> 01:29:29.280 align:start position:0%
during our
 
01:29:32.870 --> 01:29:32.880 align:start position:0%
coveted response and recovery activities
 
01:29:34.310 --> 01:29:34.320 align:start position:0%
we really could have used this
 
01:29:37.270 --> 01:29:37.280 align:start position:0%
capability we were standing up sites
 
01:29:39.430 --> 01:29:39.440 align:start position:0%
really quickly and in some cases we were
 
01:29:41.510 --> 01:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
trying to operate without
 
01:29:45.110 --> 01:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
very good network connectivity at all
 
01:29:45.120 --> 01:29:46.950 align:start position:0%
very good network connectivity at all
so

01:29:46.950 --> 01:29:46.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:29:48.870 --> 01:29:48.880 align:start position:0%
when looking at
 
01:29:50.390 --> 01:29:50.400 align:start position:0%
when looking at the ability on the
 
01:29:52.390 --> 01:29:52.400 align:start position:0%
public health space to do this
 
01:29:53.830 --> 01:29:53.840 align:start position:0%
we thought it was important to have this
 
01:29:55.669 --> 01:29:55.679 align:start position:0%
capability we could stand up a very high
 
01:29:55.679 --> 01:29:57.350 align:start position:0%
capability we could stand up a very high
quality

01:29:57.350 --> 01:29:57.360 align:start position:0%
quality
 
01:29:59.910 --> 01:29:59.920 align:start position:0%
wi-fi network that could span over a
 
01:30:02.390 --> 01:30:02.400 align:start position:0%
large geographical area and handle a
 
01:30:05.510 --> 01:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
very very dense population of users
 
01:30:07.510 --> 01:30:07.520 align:start position:0%
for that purpose so that's that was one
 
01:30:09.590 --> 01:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
of the design criteria
 
01:30:09.600 --> 01:30:10.709 align:start position:0%
of the design criteria
um

01:30:10.709 --> 01:30:10.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:12.149 --> 01:30:12.159 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:30:14.629 --> 01:30:14.639 align:start position:0%
iran or not ironically coincidentally
 
01:30:18.310 --> 01:30:18.320 align:start position:0%
that very same design criteria
 
01:30:22.149 --> 01:30:22.159 align:start position:0%
is a perfect fit for some um non-state
 
01:30:23.990 --> 01:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
events that we could potentially support
 
01:30:26.149 --> 01:30:26.159 align:start position:0%
the one that we are targeting and
 
01:30:29.030 --> 01:30:29.040 align:start position:0%
highlighting in the request is the um
 
01:30:30.629 --> 01:30:30.639 align:start position:0%
the craft fair at centipede that's run
 
01:30:32.870 --> 01:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
by the league of new hampshire craftsmen
 
01:30:35.590 --> 01:30:35.600 align:start position:0%
they've gone from
 
01:30:37.830 --> 01:30:37.840 align:start position:0%
historically the
 
01:30:40.790 --> 01:30:40.800 align:start position:0%
uh the entity that was leasing the
 
01:30:42.870 --> 01:30:42.880 align:start position:0%
centerpiece space had pretty high
 
01:30:45.030 --> 01:30:45.040 align:start position:0%
quality wi-fi that was covering that
 
01:30:46.229 --> 01:30:46.239 align:start position:0%
area and so
 
01:30:48.390 --> 01:30:48.400 align:start position:0%
it wasn't required as an additional
 
01:30:48.400 --> 01:30:49.430 align:start position:0%
it wasn't required as an additional
thing

01:30:49.430 --> 01:30:49.440 align:start position:0%
thing
 
01:30:52.950 --> 01:30:52.960 align:start position:0%
um with the the veil um lease
 
01:30:55.030 --> 01:30:55.040 align:start position:0%
part of their shtick or how they like to
 
01:30:57.030 --> 01:30:57.040 align:start position:0%
operate is to not actually have wi-fi
 
01:30:58.790 --> 01:30:58.800 align:start position:0%
there have to be an outdoor activity so
 
01:31:00.149 --> 01:31:00.159 align:start position:0%
they actually pulled all that stuff out
 
01:31:02.550 --> 01:31:02.560 align:start position:0%
of there which was you know i'm not
 
01:31:04.390 --> 01:31:04.400 align:start position:0%
aware that it impacted much except for
 
01:31:06.229 --> 01:31:06.239 align:start position:0%
the craft fair it impacted extremely
 
01:31:06.239 --> 01:31:07.189 align:start position:0%
the craft fair it impacted extremely
heavily

01:31:07.189 --> 01:31:07.199 align:start position:0%
heavily
 
01:31:09.430 --> 01:31:09.440 align:start position:0%
so i ended up
 
01:31:11.189 --> 01:31:11.199 align:start position:0%
getting a reach out from them and asking
 
01:31:13.189 --> 01:31:13.199 align:start position:0%
for help with that particularly after

what you're doing
but

01:33:09.590 --> 01:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:33:11.430 --> 01:33:11.440 align:start position:0%

some way that we can
 
01:33:23.030 --> 01:33:23.040 align:start position:0%
make this report
 
01:33:24.790 --> 01:33:24.800 align:start position:0%
a little better
 
01:33:27.189 --> 01:33:27.199 align:start position:0%
than what it is today
 
01:33:29.510 --> 01:33:29.520 align:start position:0%
i don't know how many
 
01:33:34.149 --> 01:33:34.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:34.159 --> 01:33:37.110 align:start position:0%

employee health insurance
 
01:34:03.990 --> 01:34:04.000 align:start position:0%

um
 
01:34:21.510 --> 01:34:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:24.629 --> 01:34:24.639 align:start position:0%

01:34:55.590 --> 01:34:55.600 align:start position:0%
for the record frank edelblut
 
01:34:57.669 --> 01:34:57.679 align:start position:0%
commissioner of education
 
01:34:59.189 --> 01:34:59.199 align:start position:0%
and brandon kernan administrator of the
 
01:35:00.629 --> 01:35:00.639 align:start position:0%
drinking water and groundwater bureau at
 
01:35:03.270 --> 01:35:03.280 align:start position:0%
des moines thank you
 
01:35:06.310 --> 01:35:06.320 align:start position:0%
as i read through the report
 
01:35:09.189 --> 01:35:09.199 align:start position:0%
i am very disappointed
 
01:35:09.199 --> 01:35:11.109 align:start position:0%
i am very disappointed
in

01:35:11.109 --> 01:35:11.119 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:35:14.629 --> 01:35:14.639 align:start position:0%
the schools that are reporting
 
01:35:18.390 --> 01:35:18.400 align:start position:0%
you know i didn't i didn't see a lot of
 
01:35:21.270 --> 01:35:21.280 align:start position:0%
movement on that and i know that this is
 
01:35:23.910 --> 01:35:23.920 align:start position:0%
an issue that we've had for
 
01:35:26.390 --> 01:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
several years we've put money into it
 
01:35:28.470 --> 01:35:28.480 align:start position:0%
any number of things
 
01:35:28.480 --> 01:35:30.390 align:start position:0%
any number of things
so

01:35:30.390 --> 01:35:30.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:35:36.070 --> 01:35:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:39.430 --> 01:35:39.440 align:start position:0%
we need to we need to try to up the
 
01:35:41.990 --> 01:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
number of schools and day care centers
 
01:35:43.990 --> 01:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
did we pass that bill
 
01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:45.510 align:start position:0%
did we pass that bill
on

01:35:45.510 --> 01:35:45.520 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:35:47.830 --> 01:35:47.840 align:start position:0%
unlead and reporting
 
01:35:49.510 --> 01:35:49.520 align:start position:0%
and that's the one that
 
01:35:52.550 --> 01:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
that requires the schools to report
 
01:35:58.629 --> 01:35:58.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:00.550 --> 01:36:00.560 align:start position:0%
i think they've already been to work
 
01:36:03.350 --> 01:36:03.360 align:start position:0%
right but i had to report the test and
 
01:36:06.390 --> 01:36:06.400 align:start position:0%
yeah report that that bill
 
01:36:08.070 --> 01:36:08.080 align:start position:0%
lowers the
 
01:36:12.070 --> 01:36:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:14.310 --> 01:36:14.320 align:start position:0%
yeah go ahead i'm just
 
01:36:17.669 --> 01:36:17.679 align:start position:0%
i just think it's unconscionable
 
01:36:21.430 --> 01:36:21.440 align:start position:0%
that our schools and uh daycare centers
 
01:36:21.440 --> 01:36:23.350 align:start position:0%
that our schools and uh daycare centers
are

01:36:23.350 --> 01:36:23.360 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:36:23.360 --> 01:36:24.709 align:start position:0%
are
just

01:36:24.709 --> 01:36:24.719 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:36:27.830 --> 01:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
not doing a good job with this but
 
01:36:30.790 --> 01:36:30.800 align:start position:0%
thank you representative yes
 
01:36:30.800 --> 01:36:32.390 align:start position:0%
thank you representative yes
[Music]

01:36:32.390 --> 01:36:32.400 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:36:34.470 --> 01:36:34.480 align:start position:0%
house bill 1421 did go through
 
01:36:36.070 --> 01:36:36.080 align:start position:0%
conference committee in addition to
 
01:36:38.629 --> 01:36:38.639 align:start position:0%
lowing the action level for schools and
 
01:36:40.870 --> 01:36:40.880 align:start position:0%
child care facilities from 15 to 5 parts
 
01:36:41.990 --> 01:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
per billion
 
01:36:44.070 --> 01:36:44.080 align:start position:0%
it really strengthens a couple things
 
01:36:46.310 --> 01:36:46.320 align:start position:0%
that i think will inspire people to
 
01:36:48.310 --> 01:36:48.320 align:start position:0%
react and also make the department more
 
01:36:50.390 --> 01:36:50.400 align:start position:0%
aware if they do
 
01:36:52.229 --> 01:36:52.239 align:start position:0%
one thing it does is it has very
 
01:36:52.239 --> 01:36:53.510 align:start position:0%
one thing it does is it has very
explicit

01:36:53.510 --> 01:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
explicit
 
01:36:55.430 --> 01:36:55.440 align:start position:0%
parental notification requirements now
 
01:36:56.950 --> 01:36:56.960 align:start position:0%
instead of just a general statement you
 
01:36:58.950 --> 01:36:58.960 align:start position:0%
shall notify guardians and parents it
 
01:37:01.270 --> 01:37:01.280 align:start position:0%
talks about direct notification
 
01:37:02.550 --> 01:37:02.560 align:start position:0%
and also
 
01:37:02.560 --> 01:37:03.830 align:start position:0%
and also
posting

01:37:03.830 --> 01:37:03.840 align:start position:0%
posting
 
01:37:06.070 --> 01:37:06.080 align:start position:0%
but it also now says clearly that you
 
01:37:08.390 --> 01:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
have to report all sampling data to the
 
01:37:10.310 --> 01:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
department environmental services prior
 
01:37:12.709 --> 01:37:12.719 align:start position:0%
to that we only had to see
 
01:37:15.830 --> 01:37:15.840 align:start position:0%
the results that were exceedances um and
 
01:37:18.709 --> 01:37:18.719 align:start position:0%
so now we'll have access to all the data
 
01:37:21.669 --> 01:37:21.679 align:start position:0%
another thing to remember is although
 
01:37:23.350 --> 01:37:23.360 align:start position:0%
the legislation and funding was
 
01:37:25.669 --> 01:37:25.679 align:start position:0%
established a few years ago it was only
 
01:37:27.669 --> 01:37:27.679 align:start position:0%
staffed about a year ago with a
 
01:37:29.590 --> 01:37:29.600 align:start position:0%
part-time person funded by a federal
 
01:37:31.510 --> 01:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
grant and then a contractor just came on
 
01:37:33.510 --> 01:37:33.520 align:start position:0%
board the last few months
 
01:37:35.830 --> 01:37:35.840 align:start position:0%
and so there's a lot of activity now in
 
01:37:37.510 --> 01:37:37.520 align:start position:0%
getting the word out to schools and
 
01:37:39.510 --> 01:37:39.520 align:start position:0%
child care facilities we're learning a
 
01:37:41.669 --> 01:37:41.679 align:start position:0%
few things though the number of grants
 
01:37:44.229 --> 01:37:44.239 align:start position:0%
here don't reflect necessarily
 
01:37:46.229 --> 01:37:46.239 align:start position:0%
inactivity from schools and child care
 
01:37:46.239 --> 01:37:47.590 align:start position:0%
inactivity from schools and child care
facilities

01:37:47.590 --> 01:37:47.600 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
01:37:49.189 --> 01:37:49.199 align:start position:0%
the way the law reads is they have to
 
01:37:51.189 --> 01:37:51.199 align:start position:0%
sample pretty much any fixture that
 
01:37:53.189 --> 01:37:53.199 align:start position:0%
could be available for drinking water
 
01:37:55.030 --> 01:37:55.040 align:start position:0%
and sometimes they're just sort of
 
01:37:56.950 --> 01:37:56.960 align:start position:0%
abandoned sinks in a classroom that's
 
01:37:59.510 --> 01:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
not really used and so it's easier just
 
01:38:01.510 --> 01:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
turn off the water into the sink because
 
01:38:02.870 --> 01:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
no one's using it and that's why the
 
01:38:05.350 --> 01:38:05.360 align:start position:0%
result might be high because it's a sink
 
01:38:07.270 --> 01:38:07.280 align:start position:0%
that hasn't that has stagnant water in
 
01:38:07.280 --> 01:38:07.990 align:start position:0%
that hasn't that has stagnant water in
it

01:38:07.990 --> 01:38:08.000 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:38:10.070 --> 01:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
and that's the kind of data that we're
 
01:38:11.830 --> 01:38:11.840 align:start position:0%
trying to capture with our contractor
 
01:38:14.470 --> 01:38:14.480 align:start position:0%
now there's no reporting mechanism built
 
01:38:17.590 --> 01:38:17.600 align:start position:0%
in necessarily to show that
 
01:38:18.629 --> 01:38:18.639 align:start position:0%
but now
 
01:38:20.470 --> 01:38:20.480 align:start position:0%
we're going to get all the data we will
 
01:38:23.590 --> 01:38:23.600 align:start position:0%
be able to respond to those exceedances
 
01:38:25.270 --> 01:38:25.280 align:start position:0%
the other thing that's happening
 
01:38:27.430 --> 01:38:27.440 align:start position:0%
is that this and i think it's on admin
 
01:38:29.430 --> 01:38:29.440 align:start position:0%
services website now there's a request
 
01:38:32.070 --> 01:38:32.080 align:start position:0%
for proposals to establish free testing
 
01:38:34.790 --> 01:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
services for lead for schools and child
 
01:38:36.229 --> 01:38:36.239 align:start position:0%
care facilities
 
01:38:38.390 --> 01:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
and that's again funded with a federal
 
01:38:40.790 --> 01:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
epa grant and so that'll make it more
 
01:38:42.629 --> 01:38:42.639 align:start position:0%
accessible for those facilities to
 
01:38:45.109 --> 01:38:45.119 align:start position:0%
readily sample and not worry about costs
 
01:38:46.550 --> 01:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
and budgets
 
01:38:46.560 --> 01:38:47.590 align:start position:0%
and budgets
and

01:38:47.590 --> 01:38:47.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:38:48.790 --> 01:38:48.800 align:start position:0%
i guess the
 
01:38:51.109 --> 01:38:51.119 align:start position:0%
the last thing that we're contemplating
 
01:38:53.030 --> 01:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
and still having discussions is
 
01:38:55.510 --> 01:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
wondering about possibly tweaking the
 
01:38:57.669 --> 01:38:57.679 align:start position:0%
parameters of the grant we know some
 
01:38:59.510 --> 01:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
facilities are opting to
 
01:39:02.790 --> 01:39:02.800 align:start position:0%
address a 500 1 000 problem without
 
01:39:04.870 --> 01:39:04.880 align:start position:0%
seeking reimbursement through the grant
 
01:39:06.629 --> 01:39:06.639 align:start position:0%
just because of the extra administrative
 
01:39:08.709 --> 01:39:08.719 align:start position:0%
work it's not worth their while
 
01:39:08.719 --> 01:39:09.750 align:start position:0%
work it's not worth their while
so

01:39:09.750 --> 01:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:39:12.149 --> 01:39:12.159 align:start position:0%
you know i'm pretty optimistic about
 
01:39:13.430 --> 01:39:13.440 align:start position:0%
them that these facilities are
 
01:39:15.189 --> 01:39:15.199 align:start position:0%
responding to the data
 
01:39:17.350 --> 01:39:17.360 align:start position:0%
because you know
 
01:39:18.470 --> 01:39:18.480 align:start position:0%
they're in the businesses they care
 
01:39:20.390 --> 01:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
about children i just don't think we
 
01:39:22.550 --> 01:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
have the mechanism until now and we
 
01:39:23.990 --> 01:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
still need to figure out the staffing
 
01:39:26.310 --> 01:39:26.320 align:start position:0%
because house bill 1421
 
01:39:28.070 --> 01:39:28.080 align:start position:0%
didn't include money to administer it so
 
01:39:29.430 --> 01:39:29.440 align:start position:0%
we're going to try using more federal
 
01:39:31.030 --> 01:39:31.040 align:start position:0%
funds to hire
 
01:39:33.189 --> 01:39:33.199 align:start position:0%
another part-time person
 
01:39:35.750 --> 01:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
or more contractors because at the end
 
01:39:38.149 --> 01:39:38.159 align:start position:0%
of the day we have 1500 new entities we
 
01:39:39.830 --> 01:39:39.840 align:start position:0%
have to essentially regulate and about
 
01:39:42.070 --> 01:39:42.080 align:start position:0%
30 000 compliance points and we're doing
 
01:39:44.229 --> 01:39:44.239 align:start position:0%
with a three-fourths of a staff person
 
01:39:46.790 --> 01:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
and a contractor so a lot of this is
 
01:39:48.470 --> 01:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
really needing the schools and child
 
01:39:51.350 --> 01:39:51.360 align:start position:0%
care facilities to cooperate and do the
 
01:39:52.310 --> 01:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
work because we're not going to have
 
01:39:54.149 --> 01:39:54.159 align:start position:0%
this big regulatory regime in place over
 
01:39:54.159 --> 01:39:56.390 align:start position:0%
this big regulatory regime in place over
them

01:39:56.390 --> 01:39:56.400 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:39:58.149 --> 01:39:58.159 align:start position:0%
let's hope not
 
01:40:00.390 --> 01:40:00.400 align:start position:0%
representative or senator rosenwald
 
01:40:02.310 --> 01:40:02.320 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:40:06.870 --> 01:40:06.880 align:start position:0%
um so for about three years or so
 
01:40:10.310 --> 01:40:10.320 align:start position:0%
schools um and child care facilities
 
01:40:10.320 --> 01:40:11.350 align:start position:0%
schools um and child care facilities
that

01:40:11.350 --> 01:40:11.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:40:13.910 --> 01:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
have tested
 
01:40:16.629 --> 01:40:16.639 align:start position:0%
and and found that their drinking water
 
01:40:19.510 --> 01:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
has greater than 15 parts per billion of
 
01:40:21.830 --> 01:40:21.840 align:start position:0%
lead in it have been required to
 
01:40:26.149 --> 01:40:26.159 align:start position:0%
remediate why is it that only 51
 
01:40:27.550 --> 01:40:27.560 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:40:27.560 --> 01:40:29.350 align:start position:0%
of the
219

01:40:29.350 --> 01:40:29.360 align:start position:0%
219
 
01:40:32.790 --> 01:40:32.800 align:start position:0%
schools that you list above that
 
01:40:35.270 --> 01:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
led content
 
01:40:38.470 --> 01:40:38.480 align:start position:0%
have remediated
 
01:40:40.950 --> 01:40:40.960 align:start position:0%
and i i asked this knowing that we took
 
01:40:43.510 --> 01:40:43.520 align:start position:0%
the enforcement provision
 
01:40:47.590 --> 01:40:47.600 align:start position:0%
out of house bill 1421.
 
01:40:49.830 --> 01:40:49.840 align:start position:0%
so i'll let des comment as well but what
 
01:40:52.550 --> 01:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
i can tell you is that in many cases um
 
01:40:54.709 --> 01:40:54.719 align:start position:0%
when the schools have had a hit
 
01:40:56.870 --> 01:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
so they've identified a
 
01:40:56.880 --> 01:40:57.750 align:start position:0%
so they've identified a
um

01:40:57.750 --> 01:40:57.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:59.830 --> 01:40:59.840 align:start position:0%
you know some water source that had and
 
01:41:01.030 --> 01:41:01.040 align:start position:0%
it may or may not have been used for
 
01:41:02.070 --> 01:41:02.080 align:start position:0%
drinking water so i just want to be
 
01:41:03.189 --> 01:41:03.199 align:start position:0%
careful because sometimes it's the
 
01:41:05.270 --> 01:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
janitor's closet as well
 
01:41:07.750 --> 01:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
but sometimes when they discovered it
 
01:41:10.550 --> 01:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
they just remediated them it remediated
 
01:41:12.709 --> 01:41:12.719 align:start position:0%
that themselves many of our schools have
 
01:41:14.149 --> 01:41:14.159 align:start position:0%
switched over to water bottle filling
 
01:41:15.590 --> 01:41:15.600 align:start position:0%
stations as opposed to drinking
 
01:41:16.790 --> 01:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
fountains they had already had those
 
01:41:18.310 --> 01:41:18.320 align:start position:0%
projects in place and they went through
 
01:41:18.320 --> 01:41:19.270 align:start position:0%
projects in place and they went through
that

01:41:19.270 --> 01:41:19.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:41:20.870 --> 01:41:20.880 align:start position:0%
and that would have solved that problem
 
01:41:23.109 --> 01:41:23.119 align:start position:0%
but rather than go through the process
 
01:41:24.790 --> 01:41:24.800 align:start position:0%
of applying through des for the
 
01:41:27.109 --> 01:41:27.119 align:start position:0%
remediation plan they just did it
 
01:41:29.270 --> 01:41:29.280 align:start position:0%
so a lot of that remediation has taken
 
01:41:31.430 --> 01:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
place even though it doesn't reflect in
 
01:41:33.830 --> 01:41:33.840 align:start position:0%
the reported numbers and i think des
 
01:41:36.550 --> 01:41:36.560 align:start position:0%
should comment as well
 
01:41:39.109 --> 01:41:39.119 align:start position:0%
yeah that that's correct i i'm
 
01:41:40.629 --> 01:41:40.639 align:start position:0%
pretty confident the majority of the
 
01:41:42.390 --> 01:41:42.400 align:start position:0%
exceedances have been addressed and
 
01:41:42.400 --> 01:41:43.430 align:start position:0%
exceedances have been addressed and
again

01:41:43.430 --> 01:41:43.440 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:41:45.669 --> 01:41:45.679 align:start position:0%
not everyone felt the grant program was
 
01:41:47.270 --> 01:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
worth their while that they could it was
 
01:41:49.189 --> 01:41:49.199 align:start position:0%
just easier to mitigate the problem
 
01:41:50.870 --> 01:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
without the state funding and the state
 
01:41:53.189 --> 01:41:53.199 align:start position:0%
paperwork involved i mean one thing we
 
01:41:54.470 --> 01:41:54.480 align:start position:0%
can do
 
01:41:56.149 --> 01:41:56.159 align:start position:0%
and again we have very limited staff is
 
01:41:58.870 --> 01:41:58.880 align:start position:0%
reach out to the exceedances and ask
 
01:42:00.470 --> 01:42:00.480 align:start position:0%
where they haven't told us
 
01:42:02.470 --> 01:42:02.480 align:start position:0%
how they've mitigated it or if they've
 
01:42:05.669 --> 01:42:05.679 align:start position:0%
deactivated that that fixture and we can
 
01:42:07.910 --> 01:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
try reporting that back to you
 
01:42:07.920 --> 01:42:08.790 align:start position:0%
try reporting that back to you
um

01:42:08.790 --> 01:42:08.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:10.870 --> 01:42:10.880 align:start position:0%
thank you so
 
01:42:10.880 --> 01:42:11.669 align:start position:0%
thank you so
how

01:42:11.669 --> 01:42:11.679 align:start position:0%
how
 
01:42:13.590 --> 01:42:13.600 align:start position:0%
if they're not reporting that they've
 
01:42:13.600 --> 01:42:16.470 align:start position:0%
if they're not reporting that they've
remediated

01:42:16.470 --> 01:42:16.480 align:start position:0%
remediated
 
01:42:19.430 --> 01:42:19.440 align:start position:0%
what makes you confident
 
01:42:19.440 --> 01:42:20.390 align:start position:0%
what makes you confident
that

01:42:20.390 --> 01:42:20.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:42:22.470 --> 01:42:22.480 align:start position:0%
the majority of them
 
01:42:24.709 --> 01:42:24.719 align:start position:0%
have remediated
 
01:42:24.719 --> 01:42:25.910 align:start position:0%
have remediated
those

01:42:25.910 --> 01:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:42:30.950 --> 01:42:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:33.430 --> 01:42:33.440 align:start position:0%
well i have a lot of confidence in the
 
01:42:35.669 --> 01:42:35.679 align:start position:0%
education system and the people that
 
01:42:37.109 --> 01:42:37.119 align:start position:0%
work in it
 
01:42:37.119 --> 01:42:38.149 align:start position:0%
work in it
i

01:42:38.149 --> 01:42:38.159 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:42:40.070 --> 01:42:40.080 align:start position:0%
actually have two brother-in-laws a
 
01:42:42.629 --> 01:42:42.639 align:start position:0%
spouse and a sister-in-law all work in
 
01:42:42.639 --> 01:42:43.669 align:start position:0%
spouse and a sister-in-law all work in
school

01:42:43.669 --> 01:42:43.679 align:start position:0%
school
 
01:42:45.350 --> 01:42:45.360 align:start position:0%
systems and
 
01:42:46.709 --> 01:42:46.719 align:start position:0%
have seen when there's a water quality
 
01:42:49.030 --> 01:42:49.040 align:start position:0%
issue be a high fluoride level or a lead
 
01:42:50.550 --> 01:42:50.560 align:start position:0%
level and seeing that they've take
 
01:42:52.790 --> 01:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
actions to notify people
 
01:42:55.189 --> 01:42:55.199 align:start position:0%
and to mitigate the problem
 
01:42:56.470 --> 01:42:56.480 align:start position:0%
yeah there's probably somebody out there
 
01:42:58.310 --> 01:42:58.320 align:start position:0%
that needs a little more oversight and
 
01:43:00.550 --> 01:43:00.560 align:start position:0%
nudge but i'm confident in general the
 
01:43:03.270 --> 01:43:03.280 align:start position:0%
people in this the sector are addressing
 
01:43:05.270 --> 01:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
a high lead level they unders they if
 
01:43:07.030 --> 01:43:07.040 align:start position:0%
anyone understands what lead can do to
 
01:43:07.040 --> 01:43:09.030 align:start position:0%
anyone understands what lead can do to
children

01:43:09.030 --> 01:43:09.040 align:start position:0%
children
 
01:43:11.189 --> 01:43:11.199 align:start position:0%
so the only and i would just comment um
 
01:43:13.590 --> 01:43:13.600 align:start position:0%
senator relative to that is that
 
01:43:14.870 --> 01:43:14.880 align:start position:0%
you know um
 
01:43:17.109 --> 01:43:17.119 align:start position:0%
again i don't i'm not sure that sort of
 
01:43:19.189 --> 01:43:19.199 align:start position:0%
that but another perspective might also
 
01:43:21.189 --> 01:43:21.199 align:start position:0%
be i mean i know at the department of
 
01:43:23.189 --> 01:43:23.199 align:start position:0%
education we have repeatedly brought
 
01:43:24.709 --> 01:43:24.719 align:start position:0%
this to the attention of our school
 
01:43:24.719 --> 01:43:25.990 align:start position:0%
this to the attention of our school
leadership

01:43:25.990 --> 01:43:26.000 align:start position:0%
leadership
 
01:43:27.830 --> 01:43:27.840 align:start position:0%
you know through written notifications
 
01:43:29.590 --> 01:43:29.600 align:start position:0%
and you know over a number of years
 
01:43:31.109 --> 01:43:31.119 align:start position:0%
through superintendent conferences
 
01:43:32.870 --> 01:43:32.880 align:start position:0%
through superintendent meetings so we
 
01:43:34.950 --> 01:43:34.960 align:start position:0%
continue to say to them and we have
 
01:43:37.430 --> 01:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
grant money grant funds available to you
 
01:43:38.870 --> 01:43:38.880 align:start position:0%
if you have an issue that needs to be
 
01:43:40.310 --> 01:43:40.320 align:start position:0%
remediated so while they weren't
 
01:43:42.070 --> 01:43:42.080 align:start position:0%
required to report that information to
 
01:43:43.830 --> 01:43:43.840 align:start position:0%
us we were very active in terms of
 
01:43:45.590 --> 01:43:45.600 align:start position:0%
pushing this out to them
 
01:43:47.510 --> 01:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
and we work directly i mean i know you
 
01:43:49.590 --> 01:43:49.600 align:start position:0%
know amy clark as well works very
 
01:43:51.189 --> 01:43:51.199 align:start position:0%
closely with the facilities folks to
 
01:43:53.430 --> 01:43:53.440 align:start position:0%
make sure that they as well know as
 
01:43:54.950 --> 01:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
we're going through kind of the building
 
01:43:58.149 --> 01:43:58.159 align:start position:0%
inspection process they know that uh you
 
01:44:00.870 --> 01:44:00.880 align:start position:0%
know there are if if there's any barrier
 
01:44:00.880 --> 01:44:01.590 align:start position:0%
know there are if if there's any barrier
to

01:44:01.590 --> 01:44:01.600 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:44:03.350 --> 01:44:03.360 align:start position:0%
you know remediation that we have
 
01:44:05.430 --> 01:44:05.440 align:start position:0%
solutions to that
 
01:44:07.669 --> 01:44:07.679 align:start position:0%
um but if i could just follow up i don't
 
01:44:09.590 --> 01:44:09.600 align:start position:0%
want to over promise i mean we are not
 
01:44:11.030 --> 01:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
staff to
 
01:44:13.430 --> 01:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
have a comprehensive regulatory
 
01:44:15.270 --> 01:44:15.280 align:start position:0%
oversight of this law and all these
 
01:44:17.669 --> 01:44:17.679 align:start position:0%
entities for these provisions we are
 
01:44:19.189 --> 01:44:19.199 align:start position:0%
getting the word out we're getting the
 
01:44:21.510 --> 01:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
data responding to high levels
 
01:44:23.510 --> 01:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
but an ideal world we'd have several
 
01:44:25.510 --> 01:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
staff in a database that takes the flow
 
01:44:27.350 --> 01:44:27.360 align:start position:0%
of data sends out letters requiring
 
01:44:29.430 --> 01:44:29.440 align:start position:0%
notification making schools prove they
 
01:44:31.030 --> 01:44:31.040 align:start position:0%
did a notification
 
01:44:34.070 --> 01:44:34.080 align:start position:0%
showing the schools they have violations
 
01:44:35.430 --> 01:44:35.440 align:start position:0%
making them show they have corrective
 
01:44:35.440 --> 01:44:36.470 align:start position:0%
making them show they have corrective
action

01:44:36.470 --> 01:44:36.480 align:start position:0%
action
 
01:44:38.390 --> 01:44:38.400 align:start position:0%
we just can't do that with a federally
 
01:44:39.990 --> 01:44:40.000 align:start position:0%
funded three-fourth of the time staff
 
01:44:42.870 --> 01:44:42.880 align:start position:0%
position so we are really trying to
 
01:44:45.669 --> 01:44:45.679 align:start position:0%
leverage our partnerships with hhs and
 
01:44:47.430 --> 01:44:47.440 align:start position:0%
department of education and our
 
01:44:50.390 --> 01:44:50.400 align:start position:0%
contractor to do the best we can
 
01:44:52.070 --> 01:44:52.080 align:start position:0%
we there were fiscal notes to all these
 
01:44:53.830 --> 01:44:53.840 align:start position:0%
bills and the funds weren't there but i
 
01:44:55.350 --> 01:44:55.360 align:start position:0%
think we're still doing a very effective
 
01:44:58.149 --> 01:44:58.159 align:start position:0%
job with the approach we're taking
 
01:44:59.750 --> 01:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
so i mean
 
01:45:02.390 --> 01:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
i think schools are great too
 
01:45:06.550 --> 01:45:06.560 align:start position:0%
but i'm not hearing that beyond
 
01:45:08.709 --> 01:45:08.719 align:start position:0%
your confidence and the fact that you
 
01:45:11.109 --> 01:45:11.119 align:start position:0%
know people who work in schools
 
01:45:14.790 --> 01:45:14.800 align:start position:0%
that we're actually getting reports from
 
01:45:16.709 --> 01:45:16.719 align:start position:0%
this schools
 
01:45:19.510 --> 01:45:19.520 align:start position:0%
that they are remediating
 
01:45:23.109 --> 01:45:23.119 align:start position:0%
a problem that we know poisons hundreds
 
01:45:24.470 --> 01:45:24.480 align:start position:0%
of children
 
01:45:26.629 --> 01:45:26.639 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire is there more
 
01:45:28.629 --> 01:45:28.639 align:start position:0%
legislative action we're going to need
 
01:45:33.270 --> 01:45:33.280 align:start position:0%
to take to require that when the schools
 
01:45:34.470 --> 01:45:34.480 align:start position:0%
that have
 
01:45:37.750 --> 01:45:37.760 align:start position:0%
right now 15 parts per billion
 
01:45:39.030 --> 01:45:39.040 align:start position:0%
starting in
 
01:45:40.709 --> 01:45:40.719 align:start position:0%
you know a few months
 
01:45:43.350 --> 01:45:43.360 align:start position:0%
hopefully it'll be five parts per
 
01:45:46.229 --> 01:45:46.239 align:start position:0%
billion are we going to need to
 
01:45:46.239 --> 01:45:48.070 align:start position:0%
billion are we going to need to
require

01:45:48.070 --> 01:45:48.080 align:start position:0%
require
 
01:45:52.149 --> 01:45:52.159 align:start position:0%
the schools to report to in des that
 
01:45:54.550 --> 01:45:54.560 align:start position:0%
they have remediated
 
01:45:56.709 --> 01:45:56.719 align:start position:0%
the problems
 
01:45:59.830 --> 01:45:59.840 align:start position:0%
we can keep establishing requirements
 
01:46:02.310 --> 01:46:02.320 align:start position:0%
for schools and child care facilities on
 
01:46:04.310 --> 01:46:04.320 align:start position:0%
what they have to do
 
01:46:06.390 --> 01:46:06.400 align:start position:0%
but if you want des to be able to say
 
01:46:08.310 --> 01:46:08.320 align:start position:0%
like we can for water systems here's
 
01:46:10.229 --> 01:46:10.239 align:start position:0%
exactly where each water system stands
 
01:46:11.510 --> 01:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
they collected the sample here's the
 
01:46:13.109 --> 01:46:13.119 align:start position:0%
result here's the notification here's
 
01:46:14.629 --> 01:46:14.639 align:start position:0%
the treatment that was installed if you
 
01:46:16.390 --> 01:46:16.400 align:start position:0%
want to do that we're going to need more
 
01:46:16.400 --> 01:46:17.990 align:start position:0%
want to do that we're going to need more
than

01:46:17.990 --> 01:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
than
 
01:46:20.310 --> 01:46:20.320 align:start position:0%
a year-to-year part-time person funded
 
01:46:22.149 --> 01:46:22.159 align:start position:0%
to administer the program
 
01:46:23.510 --> 01:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
and i'm just trying to be transparent
 
01:46:25.030 --> 01:46:25.040 align:start position:0%
with you i mean we're trying as hard as
 
01:46:28.229 --> 01:46:28.239 align:start position:0%
we can trying to find resources
 
01:46:30.790 --> 01:46:30.800 align:start position:0%
to implement the law but there's
 
01:46:32.790 --> 01:46:32.800 align:start position:0%
limitations um when there's funding
 
01:46:32.800 --> 01:46:34.229 align:start position:0%
limitations um when there's funding
limitations

01:46:34.229 --> 01:46:34.239 align:start position:0%
limitations
 
01:46:36.310 --> 01:46:36.320 align:start position:0%
a lot of requirements without
 
01:46:38.629 --> 01:46:38.639 align:start position:0%
really a lot of budgeting and financing
 
01:46:40.390 --> 01:46:40.400 align:start position:0%
for it at this point and so we're i'm
 
01:46:41.669 --> 01:46:41.679 align:start position:0%
trying essentially saying we're doing
 
01:46:43.990 --> 01:46:44.000 align:start position:0%
the best we can i can't over promise
 
01:46:46.310 --> 01:46:46.320 align:start position:0%
based on the resources that we we have
 
01:46:47.669 --> 01:46:47.679 align:start position:0%
been given for this
 
01:46:47.679 --> 01:46:49.189 align:start position:0%
been given for this
statute

01:46:49.189 --> 01:46:49.199 align:start position:0%
statute
 
01:46:51.750 --> 01:46:51.760 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah i would i would hope that
 
01:46:54.950 --> 01:46:54.960 align:start position:0%
you could convince your leadership
 
01:46:59.990 --> 01:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
in des to uh request that for the 2425
 
01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:01.109 align:start position:0%
in des to uh request that for the 2425
budget

01:47:01.109 --> 01:47:01.119 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:47:03.270 --> 01:47:03.280 align:start position:0%
i mean there's obviously a line item
 
01:47:05.109 --> 01:47:05.119 align:start position:0%
there for it
 
01:47:07.590 --> 01:47:07.600 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:47:11.109 --> 01:47:11.119 align:start position:0%
i would ask that you
 
01:47:13.350 --> 01:47:13.360 align:start position:0%
pursue that with uh
 
01:47:15.830 --> 01:47:15.840 align:start position:0%
with leadership thank you we can pretty
 
01:47:17.430 --> 01:47:17.440 align:start position:0%
much draw from our fiscal notes and put
 
01:47:19.990 --> 01:47:20.000 align:start position:0%
it right in there okay well
 
01:47:22.470 --> 01:47:22.480 align:start position:0%
then we gotta move up but that's a
 
01:47:26.950 --> 01:47:26.960 align:start position:0%
anyhow hopefully we'll see some um
 
01:47:30.629 --> 01:47:30.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:32.950 --> 01:47:32.960 align:start position:0%
okay uh
 
01:47:36.070 --> 01:47:36.080 align:start position:0%
are there any questions on the uh
 
01:47:36.080 --> 01:47:40.390 align:start position:0%
are there any questions on the uh
dashboard

01:47:40.390 --> 01:47:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:45.350 --> 01:47:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:45.360 --> 01:47:46.149 align:start position:0%
 
oh

um
 
01:48:29.030 --> 01:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
i believe this whole item was addressed
 
01:48:33.030 --> 01:48:33.040 align:start position:0%
by fiscal back in december there's 27
 
01:48:35.910 --> 01:48:35.920 align:start position:0%
roughly 28 million dollars
 
01:48:35.920 --> 01:48:37.109 align:start position:0%
roughly 28 million dollars
and

01:48:37.109 --> 01:48:37.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:48:41.030 --> 01:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
further down and see it talks about um
 
01:48:43.270 --> 01:48:43.280 align:start position:0%
the department is working with cms to
 
01:48:44.950 --> 01:48:44.960 align:start position:0%
obtain approvals for
 
01:48:48.390 --> 01:48:48.400 align:start position:0%
distributing the 2.8 million i kind of
 
01:48:48.400 --> 01:48:49.189 align:start position:0%
distributing the 2.8 million i kind of
thought

01:48:49.189 --> 01:48:49.199 align:start position:0%
thought
 
01:48:51.910 --> 01:48:51.920 align:start position:0%
that was part of the request
 
01:48:54.629 --> 01:48:54.639 align:start position:0%
in december is that like a separate item
 
01:48:59.669 --> 01:48:59.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:01.189 --> 01:49:01.199 align:start position:0%

this is a school that's the same
yeah

01:49:25.830 --> 01:49:25.840 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:49:26.830 --> 01:49:26.840 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:49:29.350 --> 01:49:29.360 align:start position:0%
the chris santaniello associate
 
01:49:31.709 --> 01:49:31.719 align:start position:0%
commissioner are you asking about the
 
01:49:31.719 --> 01:49:33.350 align:start position:0%
commissioner are you asking about the
2.8

01:49:33.350 --> 01:49:33.360 align:start position:0%
2.8
 
01:49:36.790 --> 01:49:36.800 align:start position:0%
there's in c there's two
 
01:49:38.950 --> 01:49:38.960 align:start position:0%
it's the 2.8 for
 
01:49:40.629 --> 01:49:40.639 align:start position:0%
private duty nursing
 
01:49:43.830 --> 01:49:43.840 align:start position:0%
yes i guess i'm asking so the managed
 
01:49:45.750 --> 01:49:45.760 align:start position:0%
care organizations
 
01:49:47.430 --> 01:49:47.440 align:start position:0%
and the
 
01:49:50.470 --> 01:49:50.480 align:start position:0%
private nurses etc have those funds been
 
01:49:52.790 --> 01:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
distributed yet or
 
01:49:54.629 --> 01:49:54.639 align:start position:0%
how is that working out because it was a
 
01:49:56.790 --> 01:49:56.800 align:start position:0%
concern back in december that
 
01:49:59.109 --> 01:49:59.119 align:start position:0%
the case managers weren't receiving
 
01:50:01.510 --> 01:50:01.520 align:start position:0%
money and i'm just curious whether they
 
01:50:03.990 --> 01:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
have received any of that 2.8 million or
 
01:50:05.430 --> 01:50:05.440 align:start position:0%
is this
 
01:50:07.589 --> 01:50:07.599 align:start position:0%
you're still working with cms to get
 
01:50:09.350 --> 01:50:09.360 align:start position:0%
that money
 
01:50:10.790 --> 01:50:10.800 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the question
 
01:50:12.790 --> 01:50:12.800 align:start position:0%
clarifications because now i'm tracking
 
01:50:15.830 --> 01:50:15.840 align:start position:0%
what you're asking about um so the the
 
01:50:17.830 --> 01:50:17.840 align:start position:0%
approximate 28 million that was for
 
01:50:19.109 --> 01:50:19.119 align:start position:0%
managed care
 
01:50:21.669 --> 01:50:21.679 align:start position:0%
um we got approval for that subsequent
 
01:50:24.550 --> 01:50:24.560 align:start position:0%
to um and i think it was probably in
 
01:50:24.560 --> 01:50:25.830 align:start position:0%
to um and i think it was probably in
january

01:50:25.830 --> 01:50:25.840 align:start position:0%
january
 
01:50:28.709 --> 01:50:28.719 align:start position:0%
for the for the approach then we needed
 
01:50:30.870 --> 01:50:30.880 align:start position:0%
to get approval for the claiming
 
01:50:33.510 --> 01:50:33.520 align:start position:0%
methodology meaning how we actually
 
01:50:36.390 --> 01:50:36.400 align:start position:0%
would um draw the money down
 
01:50:39.910 --> 01:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
we it took us until um
 
01:50:41.910 --> 01:50:41.920 align:start position:0%
we thought we had had clearance based on
 
01:50:44.790 --> 01:50:44.800 align:start position:0%
regional office approval um
 
01:50:47.990 --> 01:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
and mid-march but then we got a stop if
 
01:50:49.589 --> 01:50:49.599 align:start position:0%
you will from the
 
01:50:51.510 --> 01:50:51.520 align:start position:0%
from the central office
 
01:50:54.070 --> 01:50:54.080 align:start position:0%
we cleared that up recently
 
01:50:57.030 --> 01:50:57.040 align:start position:0%
i think it was the end of april
 
01:50:59.830 --> 01:50:59.840 align:start position:0%
we're now in process of if you remember
 
01:51:01.750 --> 01:51:01.760 align:start position:0%
part of the process is getting
 
01:51:04.470 --> 01:51:04.480 align:start position:0%
the agencies to sign an attestation
 
01:51:06.550 --> 01:51:06.560 align:start position:0%
recognizing that this is one-time money
 
01:51:08.390 --> 01:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
and etcetera and that how they're going
 
01:51:11.830 --> 01:51:11.840 align:start position:0%
to use it were um i'd say by the end of
 
01:51:14.390 --> 01:51:14.400 align:start position:0%
the month that 28 million
 
01:51:17.109 --> 01:51:17.119 align:start position:0%
um assuming that the agencies have
 
01:51:19.030 --> 01:51:19.040 align:start position:0%
submitted and all their attestations
 
01:51:21.270 --> 01:51:21.280 align:start position:0%
will be out the door
 
01:51:23.990 --> 01:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
it's we had probably a we expected that
 
01:51:25.830 --> 01:51:25.840 align:start position:0%
was going to happen in march but we got
 
01:51:27.750 --> 01:51:27.760 align:start position:0%
held up with respect to the claiming
 
01:51:29.910 --> 01:51:29.920 align:start position:0%
methodology approval
 
01:51:31.669 --> 01:51:31.679 align:start position:0%
and that's why today we're just
 
01:51:33.990 --> 01:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
reporting generally that we haven't used
 
01:51:37.750 --> 01:51:37.760 align:start position:0%
the whole 72 that we came in for we do
 
01:51:40.070 --> 01:51:40.080 align:start position:0%
expect that will all the money that we
 
01:51:41.910 --> 01:51:41.920 align:start position:0%
talked about um
 
01:51:44.470 --> 01:51:44.480 align:start position:0%
being within there will go out with
 
01:51:46.149 --> 01:51:46.159 align:start position:0%
respect to the case managers which i
 
01:51:48.149 --> 01:51:48.159 align:start position:0%
think was senator guida had that
 
01:51:50.149 --> 01:51:50.159 align:start position:0%
question in particular and possibly
 
01:51:50.159 --> 01:51:51.750 align:start position:0%
question in particular and possibly
yourself

01:51:51.750 --> 01:51:51.760 align:start position:0%
yourself
 
01:51:54.310 --> 01:51:54.320 align:start position:0%
we have received approval under the
 
01:51:56.870 --> 01:51:56.880 align:start position:0%
appendix k authority
 
01:52:00.149 --> 01:52:00.159 align:start position:0%
just this earlier this month and we have
 
01:52:02.709 --> 01:52:02.719 align:start position:0%
submitted the state plan to be able to
 
01:52:02.719 --> 01:52:03.589 align:start position:0%
submitted the state plan to be able to
also

01:52:03.589 --> 01:52:03.599 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:52:05.830 --> 01:52:05.840 align:start position:0%
do the cfi case managers
 
01:52:07.510 --> 01:52:07.520 align:start position:0%
um i think we're going to be able to get
 
01:52:10.790 --> 01:52:10.800 align:start position:0%
that money out in the month of june
 
01:52:13.910 --> 01:52:13.920 align:start position:0%
so the 2.8 million roughly will be you
 
01:52:17.189 --> 01:52:17.199 align:start position:0%
think sometime in june right okay thanks
 
01:52:19.270 --> 01:52:19.280 align:start position:0%
thanks madam chair
 
01:52:21.589 --> 01:52:21.599 align:start position:0%
so we'll follow up on that in our july
 
01:52:21.599 --> 01:52:25.109 align:start position:0%
so we'll follow up on that in our july
meeting

01:52:25.109 --> 01:52:25.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:28.149 --> 01:52:28.159 align:start position:0%
represent edwards
 
01:52:31.189 --> 01:52:31.199 align:start position:0%
uh thank you i i was with gaida and uh
 
01:52:34.310 --> 01:52:34.320 align:start position:0%
leishman curious about the case managers
 
01:52:35.669 --> 01:52:35.679 align:start position:0%
and i
 
01:52:37.510 --> 01:52:37.520 align:start position:0%
i think i recall
 
01:52:37.520 --> 01:52:39.270 align:start position:0%
i think i recall
that

01:52:39.270 --> 01:52:39.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:52:40.709 --> 01:52:40.719 align:start position:0%
the department said this would be
 
01:52:42.470 --> 01:52:42.480 align:start position:0%
resolved by april
 
01:52:45.350 --> 01:52:45.360 align:start position:0%
or may and now we're into june what
 
01:52:47.589 --> 01:52:47.599 align:start position:0%
could is my memory faulty are we
 
01:52:49.430 --> 01:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
slipping what's what's going on there
 
01:52:51.510 --> 01:52:51.520 align:start position:0%
based on what we understood at the time
 
01:52:53.109 --> 01:52:53.119 align:start position:0%
when we came in that was i think a
 
01:52:55.109 --> 01:52:55.119 align:start position:0%
reasonable time frame in fact we thought
 
01:52:57.750 --> 01:52:57.760 align:start position:0%
it was reasonable until mid-march until
 
01:53:00.550 --> 01:53:00.560 align:start position:0%
we got what we we understood to be an
 
01:53:02.629 --> 01:53:02.639 align:start position:0%
approval to draw the federal funds for
 
01:53:02.639 --> 01:53:03.350 align:start position:0%
approval to draw the federal funds for
this

01:53:03.350 --> 01:53:03.360 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:53:05.510 --> 01:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
and then we got a second
 
01:53:06.629 --> 01:53:06.639 align:start position:0%
just as we were about to pull the
 
01:53:09.030 --> 01:53:09.040 align:start position:0%
trigger we got a second email saying hey
 
01:53:11.589 --> 01:53:11.599 align:start position:0%
wait a minute we want to look at
 
01:53:13.109 --> 01:53:13.119 align:start position:0%
not only new hampshire but how other
 
01:53:14.470 --> 01:53:14.480 align:start position:0%
states are doing this
 
01:53:17.189 --> 01:53:17.199 align:start position:0%
and so we had to wait until
 
01:53:19.510 --> 01:53:19.520 align:start position:0%
they the central office at cms looked at
 
01:53:22.310 --> 01:53:22.320 align:start position:0%
it and we you know we had it we felt we
 
01:53:24.950 --> 01:53:24.960 align:start position:0%
always had a solid methodology and we
 
01:53:27.030 --> 01:53:27.040 align:start position:0%
got the green light as soon as possible
 
01:53:29.990 --> 01:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
and we were on them pretty much uh i met
 
01:53:30.950 --> 01:53:30.960 align:start position:0%
with the
 
01:53:33.270 --> 01:53:33.280 align:start position:0%
the head of cms financial management
 
01:53:35.750 --> 01:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
group the head of the managed care group
 
01:53:38.709 --> 01:53:38.719 align:start position:0%
um you know on a telephone conversation
 
01:53:40.070 --> 01:53:40.080 align:start position:0%
to make sure it wasn't something
 
01:53:42.470 --> 01:53:42.480 align:start position:0%
specific to new hampshire and it wasn't
 
01:53:44.790 --> 01:53:44.800 align:start position:0%
um they just wanted to make sure they
 
01:53:46.709 --> 01:53:46.719 align:start position:0%
were doing consistently among states and
 
01:53:48.950 --> 01:53:48.960 align:start position:0%
it just took us about another
 
01:53:51.830 --> 01:53:51.840 align:start position:0%
45 to 60 days longer than anticipated as
 
01:53:54.790 --> 01:53:54.800 align:start position:0%
a result of that
 
01:53:58.390 --> 01:53:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:00.229 --> 01:54:00.239 align:start position:0%
okay on this report
 
01:54:01.510 --> 01:54:01.520 align:start position:0%
on this report
 
01:54:02.550 --> 01:54:02.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:54:02.560 --> 01:54:03.510 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

01:54:03.510 --> 01:54:03.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:05.990 --> 01:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
on the uh paragraph three medicaid to
 
01:54:08.790 --> 01:54:08.800 align:start position:0%
schools providers i think fiscal
 
01:54:10.629 --> 01:54:10.639 align:start position:0%
committee approved
 
01:54:11.910 --> 01:54:11.920 align:start position:0%
a request
 
01:54:14.629 --> 01:54:14.639 align:start position:0%
where the school's part of it was just a
 
01:54:17.030 --> 01:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
couple of words in a three or four page
 
01:54:17.040 --> 01:54:18.870 align:start position:0%
couple of words in a three or four page
document

01:54:18.870 --> 01:54:18.880 align:start position:0%
document
 
01:54:20.870 --> 01:54:20.880 align:start position:0%
seven million dollars in federal money
 
01:54:23.270 --> 01:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
was was being moved
 
01:54:25.430 --> 01:54:25.440 align:start position:0%
i've since talked to
 
01:54:25.440 --> 01:54:26.229 align:start position:0%
i've since talked to
um

01:54:26.229 --> 01:54:26.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:27.510 --> 01:54:27.520 align:start position:0%
miss tilly
 
01:54:29.510 --> 01:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
and she says that
 
01:54:31.990 --> 01:54:32.000 align:start position:0%
this program is going to require 1
 
01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:34.550 align:start position:0%
this program is going to require 1
million

01:54:34.550 --> 01:54:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:37.030 --> 01:54:37.040 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm curious if if we're talking
 
01:54:38.870 --> 01:54:38.880 align:start position:0%
about the same program or if there's a
 
01:54:41.750 --> 01:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
different program she's she's trying to
 
01:54:43.910 --> 01:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
set out an rfa
 
01:54:45.589 --> 01:54:45.599 align:start position:0%
so that the schools can say whether or
 
01:54:47.270 --> 01:54:47.280 align:start position:0%
not they want to participate in this
 
01:54:47.280 --> 01:54:48.149 align:start position:0%
not they want to participate in this
program

01:54:48.149 --> 01:54:48.159 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:54:49.510 --> 01:54:49.520 align:start position:0%
is that what this is or is this
 
01:54:50.950 --> 01:54:50.960 align:start position:0%
something different thank you for the
 
01:54:53.430 --> 01:54:53.440 align:start position:0%
question it is something different um
 
01:54:55.669 --> 01:54:55.679 align:start position:0%
schools today can
 
01:54:57.990 --> 01:54:58.000 align:start position:0%
claim under certified public
 
01:54:58.000 --> 01:54:59.589 align:start position:0%
claim under certified public
expenditures

01:54:59.589 --> 01:54:59.599 align:start position:0%
expenditures
 
01:55:02.310 --> 01:55:02.320 align:start position:0%
additional you know matching funds what
 
01:55:04.390 --> 01:55:04.400 align:start position:0%
we've been doing all along is the
 
01:55:08.470 --> 01:55:08.480 align:start position:0%
enhanced 6.2 percent um that has existed
 
01:55:10.790 --> 01:55:10.800 align:start position:0%
um we've passed that along then this
 
01:55:12.790 --> 01:55:12.800 align:start position:0%
hcbs the home and coming based service
 
01:55:15.910 --> 01:55:15.920 align:start position:0%
component we can pass on an extra 10 for
 
01:55:18.709 --> 01:55:18.719 align:start position:0%
rehab oriented services and so we're
 
01:55:20.870 --> 01:55:20.880 align:start position:0%
we're in the process of putting that
 
01:55:22.709 --> 01:55:22.719 align:start position:0%
money out too and i think that will be
 
01:55:28.550 --> 01:55:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:29.750 --> 01:55:29.760 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
01:55:29.760 --> 01:55:31.270 align:start position:0%
okay so
um

01:55:31.270 --> 01:55:31.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:33.350 --> 01:55:33.360 align:start position:0%
in miss tilly's effort
 
01:55:36.550 --> 01:55:36.560 align:start position:0%
she's thinking that about three or four
 
01:55:39.589 --> 01:55:39.599 align:start position:0%
schools in the major population centers
 
01:55:42.149 --> 01:55:42.159 align:start position:0%
are going to expand behavioral health
 
01:55:45.589 --> 01:55:45.599 align:start position:0%
services in schools
 
01:55:48.629 --> 01:55:48.639 align:start position:0%
is this to i'm sorry to what extent
 
01:55:51.270 --> 01:55:51.280 align:start position:0%
is this related to that program are are
 
01:55:54.229 --> 01:55:54.239 align:start position:0%
these for services offered in the school
 
01:55:54.239 --> 01:55:55.109 align:start position:0%
these for services offered in the school
or

01:55:55.109 --> 01:55:55.119 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:55:57.589 --> 01:55:57.599 align:start position:0%
or something else so for this particular
 
01:55:59.990 --> 01:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
program it's only goes for services that
 
01:56:03.109 --> 01:56:03.119 align:start position:0%
were provided between april 1 of 21 and
 
01:56:06.629 --> 01:56:06.639 align:start position:0%
march 31st of of 22. so
 
01:56:08.709 --> 01:56:08.719 align:start position:0%
if it's not online yet it's not subject
 
01:56:10.310 --> 01:56:10.320 align:start position:0%

i was um
 
01:56:35.990 --> 01:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
particularly upset that
 
01:56:38.629 --> 01:56:38.639 align:start position:0%
scratch tickets are down
 
01:56:38.639 --> 01:56:40.790 align:start position:0%

um

01:56:42.870 --> 01:56:42.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:44.950 --> 01:56:44.960 align:start position:0%
for some reason or other
 
01:56:44.960 --> 01:56:45.830 align:start position:0%
for some reason or other
uh

01:56:45.830 --> 01:56:45.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:56:47.830 --> 01:56:47.840 align:start position:0%
mr mcintyre told me not to worry about
 
01:56:50.709 --> 01:56:50.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:54.830 --> 01:56:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:58.310 --> 01:56:58.320 align:start position:0%
uh it does have an effect on our
 
01:56:59.990 --> 01:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
education trust fund
 
01:57:02.629 --> 01:57:02.639 align:start position:0%
not a lot but with some
 
01:57:02.639 --> 01:57:03.830 align:start position:0%
not a lot but with some
so

01:57:03.830 --> 01:57:03.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:57:08.149 --> 01:57:08.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:10.390 --> 01:57:10.400 align:start position:0%
uh you're uh your mike's not on thank
 
01:57:12.310 --> 01:57:12.320 align:start position:0%
you thank you for having me jim durris
 
01:57:14.790 --> 01:57:14.800 align:start position:0%
the cfo for the lottery commission
 
01:57:14.800 --> 01:57:15.910 align:start position:0%
the cfo for the lottery commission
um

01:57:15.910 --> 01:57:15.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:17.830 --> 01:57:17.840 align:start position:0%
being the cfo i sometimes look at things
 
01:57:19.830 --> 01:57:19.840 align:start position:0%
differently than charlie does he's he's
 
01:57:22.709 --> 01:57:22.719 align:start position:0%
sales side i'm accounting side
 
01:57:25.350 --> 01:57:25.360 align:start position:0%
uh but i you know the obviously we're
 
01:57:27.510 --> 01:57:27.520 align:start position:0%
having a lot of financial pressures it's
 
01:57:30.310 --> 01:57:30.320 align:start position:0%
not a non-essential item gas prices
 
01:57:31.990 --> 01:57:32.000 align:start position:0%
grocery prices and everything certainly
 
01:57:33.750 --> 01:57:33.760 align:start position:0%
you're gonna have an effect
 
01:57:35.430 --> 01:57:35.440 align:start position:0%
but when you really look at the overall
 
01:57:35.440 --> 01:57:36.390 align:start position:0%
but when you really look at the overall
picture

01:57:36.390 --> 01:57:36.400 align:start position:0%
picture
 
01:57:36.400 --> 01:57:37.270 align:start position:0%
picture
um

01:57:37.270 --> 01:57:37.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:40.070 --> 01:57:40.080 align:start position:0%
we're still up overall for the year
 
01:57:41.830 --> 01:57:41.840 align:start position:0%
um this is really the first quarter
 
01:57:43.750 --> 01:57:43.760 align:start position:0%
we're feeling that pressure i do expect
 
01:57:45.589 --> 01:57:45.599 align:start position:0%
to see it in this upcoming quarter as
 
01:57:45.599 --> 01:57:46.709 align:start position:0%
to see it in this upcoming quarter as
well

01:57:46.709 --> 01:57:46.719 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:57:49.589 --> 01:57:49.599 align:start position:0%
uh but when you look at also over a you
 
01:57:51.830 --> 01:57:51.840 align:start position:0%
know two year
 
01:57:54.950 --> 01:57:54.960 align:start position:0%
uh we're still overall up year-to-date
 
01:57:57.350 --> 01:57:57.360 align:start position:0%
100 million dollars in revenues i mean
 
01:58:00.470 --> 01:58:00.480 align:start position:0%
excuse me sales during a two-year span
 
01:58:03.270 --> 01:58:03.280 align:start position:0%
so yes we saw record highs last year can
 
01:58:05.270 --> 01:58:05.280 align:start position:0%
you sustain those record highs forever
 
01:58:06.470 --> 01:58:06.480 align:start position:0%
of course not
 
01:58:07.589 --> 01:58:07.599 align:start position:0%
so we're seeing a little bit of
 
01:58:09.510 --> 01:58:09.520 align:start position:0%
flattening out but in my my opinion
 
01:58:10.870 --> 01:58:10.880 align:start position:0%
that's what really what we're seeing is
 
01:58:13.109 --> 01:58:13.119 align:start position:0%
just a little correction and flattening
 
01:58:13.119 --> 01:58:14.149 align:start position:0%
just a little correction and flattening
out

01:58:14.149 --> 01:58:14.159 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:58:15.589 --> 01:58:15.599 align:start position:0%
over the pressed
 
01:58:17.510 --> 01:58:17.520 align:start position:0%
incredible growth to over the last two
 
01:58:17.520 --> 01:58:20.550 align:start position:0%
incredible growth to over the last two
years

01:58:20.550 --> 01:58:20.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:23.910 --> 01:58:23.920 align:start position:0%
okay so i will watch it next quarter
 
01:58:26.470 --> 01:58:26.480 align:start position:0%
very good okay thank you very much
 
01:58:29.430 --> 01:58:29.440 align:start position:0%

that we'll use to facilitate our
conversation

01:59:23.030 --> 01:59:23.040 align:start position:0%

01:59:28.709 --> 01:59:28.719 align:start position:0%
information by individual school
 
01:59:31.350 --> 01:59:31.360 align:start position:0%
districts that we assumed individuals
 
01:59:34.709 --> 01:59:34.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:38.390 --> 01:59:38.400 align:start position:0%
what i can tell you as well is that

you uh called for us to come before you

i was like a month ago or something like
 
01:59:44.629 --> 01:59:44.639 align:start position:0%
that and i had been hoping my fingers
 
01:59:45.589 --> 01:59:45.599 align:start position:0%
were crossed because we're in the
 
01:59:48.310 --> 01:59:48.320 align:start position:0%
process of building an interactive
 
01:59:50.709 --> 01:59:50.719 align:start position:0%
website that will just make all of this
 
01:59:53.189 --> 01:59:53.199 align:start position:0%
information transparent and through data
 
01:59:54.790 --> 01:59:54.800 align:start position:0%
visualization people can just click and
 
01:59:56.149 --> 01:59:56.159 align:start position:0%
they'll be able to see what's going on
 
01:59:57.750 --> 01:59:57.760 align:start position:0%
at the state level at the district level
 
01:59:59.750 --> 01:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
in terms of the use of the funds so that
 
02:00:01.589 --> 02:00:01.599 align:start position:0%
will be forthcoming we are close to
 
02:00:02.950 --> 02:00:02.960 align:start position:0%
getting that done but we weren't there
 
02:00:05.109 --> 02:00:05.119 align:start position:0%
yet um i needed one more month but i
 
02:00:06.470 --> 02:00:06.480 align:start position:0%
just figured i'd come in and give you
 
02:00:08.310 --> 02:00:08.320 align:start position:0%
your update now
 
02:00:10.470 --> 02:00:10.480 align:start position:0%
if you turn to the first slide which is
 
02:00:12.629 --> 02:00:12.639 align:start position:0%
on the back of the cover slide there
 
02:00:15.030 --> 02:00:15.040 align:start position:0%
this is just to level set you in terms
 
02:00:17.830 --> 02:00:17.840 align:start position:0%
of the funds um that we are bringing to
 
02:00:19.109 --> 02:00:19.119 align:start position:0%
you today
 
02:00:21.350 --> 02:00:21.360 align:start position:0%
in fact the and um we might have
 
02:00:23.030 --> 02:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
expanded the scope of this a little bit
 
02:00:24.390 --> 02:00:24.400 align:start position:0%
we could have expanded it more but i
 
02:00:26.149 --> 02:00:26.159 align:start position:0%
wanted to be as responsive as i can the
 
02:00:28.950 --> 02:00:28.960 align:start position:0%
request was for information relative
 
02:00:31.430 --> 02:00:31.440 align:start position:0%
relative to arp funds but there's a lot
 
02:00:33.189 --> 02:00:33.199 align:start position:0%
of other grants that are out there so
 
02:00:35.430 --> 02:00:35.440 align:start position:0%
we've so what i brought to you today was
 
02:00:37.990 --> 02:00:38.000 align:start position:0%
sr1 which is often referred to as the
 
02:00:39.430 --> 02:00:39.440 align:start position:0%
cares act
 
02:00:41.910 --> 02:00:41.920 align:start position:0%
sr2 which is often referred to as
 
02:00:45.350 --> 02:00:45.360 align:start position:0%
carissa and then arp esser which was the
 
02:00:48.229 --> 02:00:48.239 align:start position:0%
specific request that you made to us
 
02:00:51.589 --> 02:00:51.599 align:start position:0%
there are other funds out there as well
 
02:00:54.310 --> 02:00:54.320 align:start position:0%
we have received we received 45 million
 
02:00:56.950 --> 02:00:56.960 align:start position:0%
dollars through the initial
 
02:00:58.870 --> 02:00:58.880 align:start position:0%
covert relief funds that the state
 
02:00:58.880 --> 02:01:00.310 align:start position:0%
covert relief funds that the state
received

02:01:00.310 --> 02:01:00.320 align:start position:0%
received
 
02:01:02.870 --> 02:01:02.880 align:start position:0%
we also received funding relative to
 
02:01:02.880 --> 02:01:04.229 align:start position:0%
we also received funding relative to
idea

02:01:04.229 --> 02:01:04.239 align:start position:0%
idea
 
02:01:05.589 --> 02:01:05.599 align:start position:0%
so we received about 10 million dollars
 
02:01:07.510 --> 02:01:07.520 align:start position:0%
of pass-through funds relative to idea
 
02:01:09.109 --> 02:01:09.119 align:start position:0%
which is not on here as well as we
 
02:01:11.350 --> 02:01:11.360 align:start position:0%
received about three million dollars for
 
02:01:13.510 --> 02:01:13.520 align:start position:0%
um homeless funds but today we are
 
02:01:15.990 --> 02:01:16.000 align:start position:0%
focusing on what i think was the main
 
02:01:17.270 --> 02:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
thing that you were looking for which
 
02:01:19.750 --> 02:01:19.760 align:start position:0%
was kind of the esser related funds
 
02:01:22.470 --> 02:01:22.480 align:start position:0%
which is the cares carissa and
 
02:01:24.310 --> 02:01:24.320 align:start position:0%
arp funds
 
02:01:25.910 --> 02:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
and you can see the award amounts that
 
02:01:27.430 --> 02:01:27.440 align:start position:0%
we have there
 
02:01:29.270 --> 02:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
the amounts that are allocated to the
 
02:01:31.990 --> 02:01:32.000 align:start position:0%
lea so it's a 90 pass-through grant so
 
02:01:34.070 --> 02:01:34.080 align:start position:0%
basically 90 of those funds pass through
 
02:01:36.070 --> 02:01:36.080 align:start position:0%
to the districts and we'll give you some
 
02:01:37.589 --> 02:01:37.599 align:start position:0%
information on that we're also going to
 
02:01:39.510 --> 02:01:39.520 align:start position:0%
give you some information today on the
 
02:01:42.709 --> 02:01:42.719 align:start position:0%
10 state level activities as well
 
02:01:44.629 --> 02:01:44.639 align:start position:0%
and then you can see the amount and and
 
02:01:46.229 --> 02:01:46.239 align:start position:0%
really what i wanted to describe to you
 
02:01:47.510 --> 02:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
is kind of the process that it goes
 
02:01:50.229 --> 02:01:50.239 align:start position:0%
through so what happens is a school so
 
02:01:51.830 --> 02:01:51.840 align:start position:0%
we get the grants
 
02:01:54.310 --> 02:01:54.320 align:start position:0%
then we make the allocations to the
 
02:01:56.550 --> 02:01:56.560 align:start position:0%
schools in our gms which is our grant
 
02:01:58.390 --> 02:01:58.400 align:start position:0%
management system
 
02:02:00.550 --> 02:02:00.560 align:start position:0%
the schools then go in and complete a
 
02:02:02.550 --> 02:02:02.560 align:start position:0%
budget for how they're going to use
 
02:02:03.910 --> 02:02:03.920 align:start position:0%
those funds
 
02:02:07.189 --> 02:02:07.199 align:start position:0%
that budget is approved in terms of
 
02:02:09.350 --> 02:02:09.360 align:start position:0%
whether those funding activities the
 
02:02:11.270 --> 02:02:11.280 align:start position:0%
budgeted activities are authorized
 
02:02:13.589 --> 02:02:13.599 align:start position:0%
activities under the grant
 
02:02:15.750 --> 02:02:15.760 align:start position:0%
once those budgets are approved then the
 
02:02:17.510 --> 02:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
schools go out and they spend those
 
02:02:19.750 --> 02:02:19.760 align:start position:0%
funds after they spend those funds then
 
02:02:21.750 --> 02:02:21.760 align:start position:0%
they submit the documentation to
 
02:02:23.270 --> 02:02:23.280 align:start position:0%
indicate that they've spent their funds
 
02:02:25.030 --> 02:02:25.040 align:start position:0%
according to their budget
 
02:02:27.990 --> 02:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
that approval process kicks off a
 
02:02:30.550 --> 02:02:30.560 align:start position:0%
a payment to them and so it comes out
 
02:02:32.149 --> 02:02:32.159 align:start position:0%
through the typical state payment
 
02:02:34.629 --> 02:02:34.639 align:start position:0%
process and simultaneously what that
 
02:02:36.310 --> 02:02:36.320 align:start position:0%
does is allows us to draw down those
 
02:02:38.149 --> 02:02:38.159 align:start position:0%
funds from the g5 system at the federal
 
02:02:40.070 --> 02:02:40.080 align:start position:0%
government level so that we reimburse
 
02:02:42.310 --> 02:02:42.320 align:start position:0%
the state so we simultaneously push the
 
02:02:44.229 --> 02:02:44.239 align:start position:0%
funds out and we draw the funds down
 
02:02:46.310 --> 02:02:46.320 align:start position:0%
from the federal government and so that
 
02:02:49.109 --> 02:02:49.119 align:start position:0%
is the process that happens um and i can
 
02:02:50.870 --> 02:02:50.880 align:start position:0%
tell you have a question go ahead yes
 
02:02:50.880 --> 02:02:52.550 align:start position:0%
tell you have a question go ahead yes
yeah

02:02:52.550 --> 02:02:52.560 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:02:55.669 --> 02:02:55.679 align:start position:0%
so you allocate the money
 
02:02:58.229 --> 02:02:58.239 align:start position:0%
the schools have to spend their own
 
02:02:58.239 --> 02:03:00.070 align:start position:0%
the schools have to spend their own
money

02:03:00.070 --> 02:03:00.080 align:start position:0%
money
 
02:03:01.589 --> 02:03:01.599 align:start position:0%
correct we have we are a reimbursement
 
02:03:03.109 --> 02:03:03.119 align:start position:0%
grant system which is the way that most
 
02:03:05.510 --> 02:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
of the states operate and so this is
 
02:03:07.910 --> 02:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
reimbursement yes i just wanted to be
 
02:03:07.920 --> 02:03:08.950 align:start position:0%
reimbursement yes i just wanted to be
sure

02:03:08.950 --> 02:03:08.960 align:start position:0%
sure
 
02:03:10.390 --> 02:03:10.400 align:start position:0%
that that's what it was it is
 
02:03:12.790 --> 02:03:12.800 align:start position:0%
reimbursement right so right they budget
 
02:03:15.109 --> 02:03:15.119 align:start position:0%
it they spend it they report that
 
02:03:16.950 --> 02:03:16.960 align:start position:0%
they've spend it then they get
 
02:03:20.870 --> 02:03:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:22.550 --> 02:03:22.560 align:start position:0%
thank you great
 
02:03:25.109 --> 02:03:25.119 align:start position:0%
um and then what you'll find is that um
 
02:03:27.189 --> 02:03:27.199 align:start position:0%
sometimes with so when they budget the
 
02:03:28.950 --> 02:03:28.960 align:start position:0%
funds it doesn't mean it's necessarily a
 
02:03:31.189 --> 02:03:31.199 align:start position:0%
locked in number they're able to
 
02:03:33.669 --> 02:03:33.679 align:start position:0%
oftentimes reopen anytime they want they
 
02:03:35.669 --> 02:03:35.679 align:start position:0%
can reopen the grant so they might have
 
02:03:37.109 --> 02:03:37.119 align:start position:0%
planned like we're going to budget these
 
02:03:40.310 --> 02:03:40.320 align:start position:0%
funds on x activity they go out and they
 
02:03:42.229 --> 02:03:42.239 align:start position:0%
do a bid on that activity and they
 
02:03:44.070 --> 02:03:44.080 align:start position:0%
realize it's going to cost us less so
 
02:03:46.310 --> 02:03:46.320 align:start position:0%
then what happens is the the
 
02:03:48.470 --> 02:03:48.480 align:start position:0%
the grant gets returned to us is what
 
02:03:50.229 --> 02:03:50.239 align:start position:0%
it's called it's kind of an odd name but
 
02:03:52.149 --> 02:03:52.159 align:start position:0%
it's returned to us
 
02:03:54.390 --> 02:03:54.400 align:start position:0%
to then so it's now they're able to
 
02:03:55.990 --> 02:03:56.000 align:start position:0%
update the budget status and then it
 
02:03:58.390 --> 02:03:58.400 align:start position:0%
gets reapproved and then they're off and
 
02:04:00.550 --> 02:04:00.560 align:start position:0%
doing their updated budget so so there's
 
02:04:02.149 --> 02:04:02.159 align:start position:0%
a lot of pushing back and forth as the
 
02:04:05.589 --> 02:04:05.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:05.599 --> 02:04:06.950 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:04:06.950 --> 02:04:06.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:04:10.709 --> 02:04:10.719 align:start position:0%
any questions on that slide
 
02:04:13.109 --> 02:04:13.119 align:start position:0%
so on the next slide
 
02:04:14.870 --> 02:04:14.880 align:start position:0%
what i did is
 
02:04:17.910 --> 02:04:17.920 align:start position:0%
outline for the leas
 
02:04:20.229 --> 02:04:20.239 align:start position:0%
some of the common uses
 
02:04:22.310 --> 02:04:22.320 align:start position:0%
based on the how they've been spending
 
02:04:23.589 --> 02:04:23.599 align:start position:0%
those funds
 
02:04:25.430 --> 02:04:25.440 align:start position:0%
and i indicated both the budgeted as
 
02:04:27.109 --> 02:04:27.119 align:start position:0%
well as the amount that's spent to date
 
02:04:28.310 --> 02:04:28.320 align:start position:0%
and the reason i did that is because
 
02:04:29.990 --> 02:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of stuff budgeted that
 
02:04:31.990 --> 02:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
hasn't been spent and spent means when
 
02:04:33.350 --> 02:04:33.360 align:start position:0%
the state
 
02:04:36.149 --> 02:04:36.159 align:start position:0%
reimburses to the lea not necessarily
 
02:04:38.310 --> 02:04:38.320 align:start position:0%
when they spend it themselves so that's
 
02:04:40.310 --> 02:04:40.320 align:start position:0%
what spent means
 
02:04:41.910 --> 02:04:41.920 align:start position:0%
and so you can see that the big
 
02:04:44.470 --> 02:04:44.480 align:start position:0%
categories are salaries and benefits
 
02:04:46.390 --> 02:04:46.400 align:start position:0%
construction and maintenance equipment
 
02:04:47.750 --> 02:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
and technology
 
02:04:49.750 --> 02:04:49.760 align:start position:0%
supplies non-instructional which would
 
02:04:51.830 --> 02:04:51.840 align:start position:0%
be primarily your coveted response type
 
02:04:54.310 --> 02:04:54.320 align:start position:0%
supplies and then support services as
 
02:04:54.320 --> 02:04:55.430 align:start position:0%
supplies and then support services as
well

02:04:55.430 --> 02:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:04:56.709 --> 02:04:56.719 align:start position:0%
and then you can see where they have
 
02:04:59.669 --> 02:04:59.679 align:start position:0%
spent across those various categories
 
02:05:00.950 --> 02:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
you can see that there's a little bit of
 
02:05:02.709 --> 02:05:02.719 align:start position:0%
difference software licensing is in the
 
02:05:04.229 --> 02:05:04.239 align:start position:0%
top five
 
02:05:06.870 --> 02:05:06.880 align:start position:0%
relative to spend but it is not in terms
 
02:05:08.629 --> 02:05:08.639 align:start position:0%
of the budgeted but that is something
 
02:05:09.830 --> 02:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
that oftentimes when you're buying
 
02:05:11.109 --> 02:05:11.119 align:start position:0%
software you have those upfront
 
02:05:12.950 --> 02:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
licensing fees so those probably just
 
02:05:15.109 --> 02:05:15.119 align:start position:0%
came through a little bit more quickly
 
02:05:17.910 --> 02:05:17.920 align:start position:0%
and and that is reflected in that
 
02:05:19.669 --> 02:05:19.679 align:start position:0%
so these are the places where those
 
02:05:21.750 --> 02:05:21.760 align:start position:0%
funds have been budgeted by the schools
 
02:05:23.750 --> 02:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
to be used
 
02:05:25.910 --> 02:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
and this basically this was a top five
 
02:05:27.990 --> 02:05:28.000 align:start position:0%
and we cut it off at top five because
 
02:05:30.470 --> 02:05:30.480 align:start position:0%
there was a fairly substantive
 
02:05:32.470 --> 02:05:32.480 align:start position:0%
gap between number five like i'd rather
 
02:05:34.069 --> 02:05:34.079 align:start position:0%
than go give you the top 10. it's kind
 
02:05:35.350 --> 02:05:35.360 align:start position:0%
of like this was a natural breaking
 
02:05:37.109 --> 02:05:37.119 align:start position:0%
point event you know we have all of the
 
02:05:38.470 --> 02:05:38.480 align:start position:0%
data all the way down to the smallest
 
02:05:40.149 --> 02:05:40.159 align:start position:0%
one but i just thought that was a good
 
02:05:41.669 --> 02:05:41.679 align:start position:0%
place to break it so that you can see
 
02:05:43.430 --> 02:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
where the numbers are
 
02:05:45.510 --> 02:05:45.520 align:start position:0%
i think for example on the spend is the
 
02:05:47.669 --> 02:05:47.679 align:start position:0%
next lowest level was like a million
 
02:05:47.679 --> 02:05:48.390 align:start position:0%
next lowest level was like a million
yeah

02:05:48.390 --> 02:05:48.400 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:05:49.910 --> 02:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
so it went from like five to down to a
 
02:05:51.189 --> 02:05:51.199 align:start position:0%
million so we thought that was a pretty
 
02:05:54.709 --> 02:05:54.719 align:start position:0%
big jump and we cut it off there
 
02:05:56.310 --> 02:05:56.320 align:start position:0%
and then on is that any other questions
 
02:05:57.910 --> 02:05:57.920 align:start position:0%
on that page
 
02:05:59.830 --> 02:05:59.840 align:start position:0%
and so then on the left yes it appears
 
02:06:01.270 --> 02:06:01.280 align:start position:0%
we have one okay
 
02:06:03.189 --> 02:06:03.199 align:start position:0%
go ahead thank you
 
02:06:05.750 --> 02:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
uh using using the money on salaries and
 
02:06:08.950 --> 02:06:08.960 align:start position:0%
benefits and being one-time money
 
02:06:10.870 --> 02:06:10.880 align:start position:0%
type things do we
 
02:06:12.950 --> 02:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
see a problem coming on down down the
 
02:06:14.709 --> 02:06:14.719 align:start position:0%
road in the local communities when
 
02:06:14.719 --> 02:06:15.589 align:start position:0%
road in the local communities when
they're

02:06:15.589 --> 02:06:15.599 align:start position:0%
they're
 
02:06:18.149 --> 02:06:18.159 align:start position:0%
using it for ongoing expenses yeah so we
 
02:06:19.589 --> 02:06:19.599 align:start position:0%
have been encouraging our districts to
 
02:06:21.990 --> 02:06:22.000 align:start position:0%
recognize that this is one-time money
 
02:06:23.830 --> 02:06:23.840 align:start position:0%
depending on which grant the last grant
 
02:06:26.709 --> 02:06:26.719 align:start position:0%
is going to expire on september 24
 
02:06:28.709 --> 02:06:28.719 align:start position:0%
and unless it's extended by the federal
 
02:06:30.709 --> 02:06:30.719 align:start position:0%
government but even so we're encouraging
 
02:06:33.270 --> 02:06:33.280 align:start position:0%
everybody to work to utilize the funds
 
02:06:36.390 --> 02:06:36.400 align:start position:0%
by that current uh finalized date so
 
02:06:38.149 --> 02:06:38.159 align:start position:0%
some of that salary and benefits is
 
02:06:40.149 --> 02:06:40.159 align:start position:0%
going to be associated with the current
 
02:06:41.669 --> 02:06:41.679 align:start position:0%
teacher force that they have it could be
 
02:06:43.910 --> 02:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
overtime could be stipends could be you
 
02:06:46.149 --> 02:06:46.159 align:start position:0%
know uh bonuses to try and retention
 
02:06:48.149 --> 02:06:48.159 align:start position:0%
bonuses or something like that some of
 
02:06:50.310 --> 02:06:50.320 align:start position:0%
it is interventionists that are being
 
02:06:51.990 --> 02:06:52.000 align:start position:0%
hired to be able to
 
02:06:54.149 --> 02:06:54.159 align:start position:0%
respond to some of the the learning
 
02:06:57.589 --> 02:06:57.599 align:start position:0%
disruption that's taking place so um
 
02:06:59.430 --> 02:06:59.440 align:start position:0%
in in theory
 
02:07:01.750 --> 02:07:01.760 align:start position:0%
uh senator if uh the learning loss is
 
02:07:03.589 --> 02:07:03.599 align:start position:0%
caught up over the period of the grant
 
02:07:05.910 --> 02:07:05.920 align:start position:0%
then you wouldn't need that learning
 
02:07:07.430 --> 02:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
interventionist at that point in time
 
02:07:09.189 --> 02:07:09.199 align:start position:0%
because you've made up the deficit that
 
02:07:11.109 --> 02:07:11.119 align:start position:0%
resulted from coven and so that wouldn't
 
02:07:12.390 --> 02:07:12.400 align:start position:0%
have to continue
 
02:07:13.990 --> 02:07:14.000 align:start position:0%
but certainly it is something that all
 
02:07:16.229 --> 02:07:16.239 align:start position:0%
districts need to be paying attention to
 
02:07:18.149 --> 02:07:18.159 align:start position:0%
in terms of making sure that we haven't
 
02:07:21.109 --> 02:07:21.119 align:start position:0%
created a cliff for ourselves um and and
 
02:07:22.790 --> 02:07:22.800 align:start position:0%
quite frankly there was a bit of a cliff
 
02:07:24.950 --> 02:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
through the if you go back to the
 
02:07:27.350 --> 02:07:27.360 align:start position:0%
through 2008-2012 recession there was a
 
02:07:29.510 --> 02:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
lot of federal funds that came in and
 
02:07:31.430 --> 02:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
that did result in some of that cliff
 
02:07:35.750 --> 02:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:38.149 --> 02:07:38.159 align:start position:0%
and then on the last page this is the
 
02:07:40.790 --> 02:07:40.800 align:start position:0%
state funding so what the the the way
 
02:07:42.870 --> 02:07:42.880 align:start position:0%
the grant is laid out it allows uh the
 
02:07:45.830 --> 02:07:45.840 align:start position:0%
state to set aside a certain percentage
 
02:07:48.470 --> 02:07:48.480 align:start position:0%
for administration of the grant and then
 
02:07:50.550 --> 02:07:50.560 align:start position:0%
it includes what's referred to as sl or
 
02:07:52.870 --> 02:07:52.880 align:start position:0%
state level activities
 
02:07:55.589 --> 02:07:55.599 align:start position:0%
some of the grants in particular under
 
02:07:58.709 --> 02:07:58.719 align:start position:0%
the arp funds the grant specifies how
 
02:08:00.149 --> 02:08:00.159 align:start position:0%
we're supposed to use it like we have
 
02:08:02.390 --> 02:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
we're required to spend at least uh 20
 
02:08:04.149 --> 02:08:04.159 align:start position:0%
percent on learning loss we're supposed
 
02:08:06.390 --> 02:08:06.400 align:start position:0%
to spend five percent on summer
 
02:08:07.910 --> 02:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
programming and five percent on
 
02:08:09.830 --> 02:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
after-school programming so they narrow
 
02:08:11.990 --> 02:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
down the scope of what we can do and so
 
02:08:14.149 --> 02:08:14.159 align:start position:0%
in here what i did is i just outlined a
 
02:08:15.430 --> 02:08:15.440 align:start position:0%
number of the contracts that we've
 
02:08:17.910 --> 02:08:17.920 align:start position:0%
entered into relative to
 
02:08:20.149 --> 02:08:20.159 align:start position:0%
various state-level activities uh the
 
02:08:21.910 --> 02:08:21.920 align:start position:0%
goal of the state-level activities was
 
02:08:23.830 --> 02:08:23.840 align:start position:0%
try and invest in programs that are
 
02:08:25.830 --> 02:08:25.840 align:start position:0%
universal in terms of supporting the
 
02:08:25.840 --> 02:08:26.790 align:start position:0%
universal in terms of supporting the
schools

02:08:26.790 --> 02:08:26.800 align:start position:0%
schools
 
02:08:29.350 --> 02:08:29.360 align:start position:0%
and not supplanting activities that they
 
02:08:30.709 --> 02:08:30.719 align:start position:0%
may have
 
02:08:33.270 --> 02:08:33.280 align:start position:0%
so for example the ilearn which is a
 
02:08:35.030 --> 02:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
canvas learning management system that
 
02:08:36.950 --> 02:08:36.960 align:start position:0%
was made available to all the schools
 
02:08:38.390 --> 02:08:38.400 align:start position:0%
many of our schools were using that
 
02:08:39.910 --> 02:08:39.920 align:start position:0%
system already so
 
02:08:42.790 --> 02:08:42.800 align:start position:0%
to senator um daniel's point so we were
 
02:08:45.669 --> 02:08:45.679 align:start position:0%
able to just you know supplement that uh
 
02:08:47.350 --> 02:08:47.360 align:start position:0%
the cost of their learning management
 
02:08:49.109 --> 02:08:49.119 align:start position:0%
system during for several years but that
 
02:08:51.109 --> 02:08:51.119 align:start position:0%
would then transfer back over
 
02:08:54.149 --> 02:08:54.159 align:start position:0%
discovery education is universal
 
02:08:55.830 --> 02:08:55.840 align:start position:0%
you know curricular high quality
 
02:08:57.350 --> 02:08:57.360 align:start position:0%
instructional materials for students so
 
02:08:59.270 --> 02:08:59.280 align:start position:0%
essentially saying you know every
 
02:09:01.430 --> 02:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
student in new hampshire
 
02:09:02.550 --> 02:09:02.560 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:09:04.470 --> 02:09:04.480 align:start position:0%
has a high quality learning management
 
02:09:06.069 --> 02:09:06.079 align:start position:0%
system which means that they can
 
02:09:07.990 --> 02:09:08.000 align:start position:0%
organize the teachers can organize the
 
02:09:10.470 --> 02:09:10.480 align:start position:0%
instruction in an effective way
 
02:09:11.910 --> 02:09:11.920 align:start position:0%
and then fill that with high quality
 
02:09:13.589 --> 02:09:13.599 align:start position:0%
instructional materials so students
 
02:09:15.990 --> 02:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
whether you live in bedford or in a
 
02:09:17.750 --> 02:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
less affluent community you're going to
 
02:09:18.790 --> 02:09:18.800 align:start position:0%
have access to high quality
 
02:09:20.709 --> 02:09:20.719 align:start position:0%
instructional materials
 
02:09:23.669 --> 02:09:23.679 align:start position:0%
eens is a bit of an odd name that is
 
02:09:25.350 --> 02:09:25.360 align:start position:0%
emergency relief to our non-public
 
02:09:25.360 --> 02:09:26.470 align:start position:0%
emergency relief to our non-public
schools

02:09:26.470 --> 02:09:26.480 align:start position:0%
schools
 
02:09:28.870 --> 02:09:28.880 align:start position:0%
so there's a separate category of
 
02:09:32.390 --> 02:09:32.400 align:start position:0%
funding that we pass through to ends
 
02:09:33.430 --> 02:09:33.440 align:start position:0%
many of you are familiar with the
 
02:09:35.109 --> 02:09:35.119 align:start position:0%
learning pod program that we've stood up
 
02:09:37.589 --> 02:09:37.599 align:start position:0%
the rekindling curiosity is our summer
 
02:09:39.669 --> 02:09:39.679 align:start position:0%
camp program yes every student is our
 
02:09:41.750 --> 02:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
tutoring program how we've got another
 
02:09:43.030 --> 02:09:43.040 align:start position:0%
tutoring program that we're going to be
 
02:09:44.790 --> 02:09:44.800 align:start position:0%
bringing online again these are
 
02:09:47.189 --> 02:09:47.199 align:start position:0%
universal programs to help the teachers
 
02:09:48.870 --> 02:09:48.880 align:start position:0%
in the schools across the state who are
 
02:09:50.310 --> 02:09:50.320 align:start position:0%
trying to work with students who have
 
02:09:51.589 --> 02:09:51.599 align:start position:0%
learning loss
 
02:09:52.950 --> 02:09:52.960 align:start position:0%
one of the things that i think is
 
02:09:54.709 --> 02:09:54.719 align:start position:0%
interesting as well is the way that
 
02:09:58.229 --> 02:09:58.239 align:start position:0%
these grants kind of rolled out
 
02:10:01.350 --> 02:10:01.360 align:start position:0%
the first funds came to us in may of
 
02:10:04.629 --> 02:10:04.639 align:start position:0%
2020. uh that would have been the gear
 
02:10:07.430 --> 02:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
one and the esser one funds and
 
02:10:08.790 --> 02:10:08.800 align:start position:0%
obviously the circumstance of the
 
02:10:11.189 --> 02:10:11.199 align:start position:0%
pandemic kind of evolved over time uh
 
02:10:13.270 --> 02:10:13.280 align:start position:0%
and so to see i can tell you quite
 
02:10:14.550 --> 02:10:14.560 align:start position:0%
frankly sometimes there were decisions
 
02:10:17.350 --> 02:10:17.360 align:start position:0%
that you made in may of 2020 that if you
 
02:10:19.510 --> 02:10:19.520 align:start position:0%
knew where you would be 18 months later
 
02:10:20.229 --> 02:10:20.239 align:start position:0%
like you didn't know where you were
 
02:10:21.350 --> 02:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
going to be maybe you would have done
 
02:10:24.229 --> 02:10:24.239 align:start position:0%
something a little bit differently
 
02:10:25.350 --> 02:10:25.360 align:start position:0%
so i don't know if there's i can go
 
02:10:26.870 --> 02:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
through all the lists and explain the
 
02:10:28.709 --> 02:10:28.719 align:start position:0%
various programs or if everybody's all
 
02:10:30.470 --> 02:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
set then or i can answer specific
 
02:10:32.229 --> 02:10:32.239 align:start position:0%
questions yeah i i just want to make
 
02:10:32.239 --> 02:10:34.790 align:start position:0%
questions yeah i i just want to make
sure

02:10:34.790 --> 02:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:34.800 --> 02:10:35.910 align:start position:0%
 
that

02:10:35.910 --> 02:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:10:39.270 --> 02:10:39.280 align:start position:0%
doe has contracted all of these things
 
02:10:40.790 --> 02:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
is that what i heard you say that's
 
02:10:43.910 --> 02:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
correct and then it's
 
02:10:45.750 --> 02:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
given down to the school system correct
 
02:10:47.990 --> 02:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
and then we pass through to the schools
 
02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:49.189 align:start position:0%
and then we pass through to the schools
okay

02:10:49.189 --> 02:10:49.199 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:10:49.199 --> 02:10:51.109 align:start position:0%
okay
okay

02:10:51.109 --> 02:10:51.119 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:10:52.950 --> 02:10:52.960 align:start position:0%
uh represent leashman
 
02:10:54.390 --> 02:10:54.400 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
02:10:55.669 --> 02:10:55.679 align:start position:0%
thanks for your
 
02:10:55.679 --> 02:10:57.030 align:start position:0%
thanks for your
information

02:10:57.030 --> 02:10:57.040 align:start position:0%
information
 
02:10:57.040 --> 02:10:58.149 align:start position:0%
information
uh

02:10:58.149 --> 02:10:58.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:11:00.310 --> 02:11:00.320 align:start position:0%
i was hoping maybe in the future that
 
02:11:03.990 --> 02:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
you could give us what like gear eens
 
02:11:06.550 --> 02:11:06.560 align:start position:0%
esther all these things mean because a
 
02:11:09.669 --> 02:11:09.679 align:start position:0%
lot of it i guess looks greek to me but
 
02:11:12.069 --> 02:11:12.079 align:start position:0%
so actual titles yes so what they
 
02:11:13.510 --> 02:11:13.520 align:start position:0%
actually are
 
02:11:14.390 --> 02:11:14.400 align:start position:0%
some of them
 
02:11:15.750 --> 02:11:15.760 align:start position:0%
it's pretty straightforward like i mean
 
02:11:17.109 --> 02:11:17.119 align:start position:0%
and i i may not even get them all
 
02:11:19.109 --> 02:11:19.119 align:start position:0%
correct because i'm so used to using it
 
02:11:21.510 --> 02:11:21.520 align:start position:0%
forward to you it's not necessarily
 
02:11:23.589 --> 02:11:23.599 align:start position:0%
straightforward to uh
 
02:11:27.270 --> 02:11:27.280 align:start position:0%
to do people that are not familiar with
 
02:11:30.550 --> 02:11:30.560 align:start position:0%
all of those weird acronyms in d.o.e
 
02:11:33.270 --> 02:11:33.280 align:start position:0%
right so yeah it just send it to us no
 
02:11:34.550 --> 02:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
problem yeah
 
02:11:36.229 --> 02:11:36.239 align:start position:0%
but as an example like gear is
 
02:11:38.390 --> 02:11:38.400 align:start position:0%
governor's emergency education relief
 
02:11:38.400 --> 02:11:39.270 align:start position:0%
governor's emergency education relief
fund

02:11:39.270 --> 02:11:39.280 align:start position:0%
fund
 
02:11:40.950 --> 02:11:40.960 align:start position:0%
so they all mean something associated
 
02:11:42.709 --> 02:11:42.719 align:start position:0%
with that yeah
 
02:11:44.149 --> 02:11:44.159 align:start position:0%
and just to follow up if i could have
 
02:11:45.990 --> 02:11:46.000 align:start position:0%
made them chair
 
02:11:47.910 --> 02:11:47.920 align:start position:0%
on the
 
02:11:50.550 --> 02:11:50.560 align:start position:0%
allocations and budgeted spent i'm just
 
02:11:51.990 --> 02:11:52.000 align:start position:0%
kind of curious because some of these
 
02:11:54.629 --> 02:11:54.639 align:start position:0%
are i'll just take dairy cooperative as
 
02:11:56.950 --> 02:11:56.960 align:start position:0%
an example on page one
 
02:11:59.350 --> 02:11:59.360 align:start position:0%
allocated 3.5
 
02:12:01.510 --> 02:12:01.520 align:start position:0%
budgeted 3.4
 
02:12:04.709 --> 02:12:04.719 align:start position:0%
approved 3.4 and there's nothing can you
 
02:12:05.990 --> 02:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
just tell me what grant you're looking
 
02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:06.709 align:start position:0%
just tell me what grant you're looking
at

02:12:06.709 --> 02:12:06.719 align:start position:0%
at
 
02:12:08.310 --> 02:12:08.320 align:start position:0%
uh that was there's all three grants
 
02:12:10.229 --> 02:12:10.239 align:start position:0%
right i'm sorry uh
 
02:12:11.750 --> 02:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
easter two
 
02:12:15.109 --> 02:12:15.119 align:start position:0%
yes or two got it okay
 
02:12:17.990 --> 02:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
on very cooperative 3.5 right budgeted
 
02:12:20.470 --> 02:12:20.480 align:start position:0%
and i just kind of curious you got the
 
02:12:22.709 --> 02:12:22.719 align:start position:0%
budgeted approved and yet nothing has
 
02:12:25.030 --> 02:12:25.040 align:start position:0%
been paid is there why has nothing been
 
02:12:26.550 --> 02:12:26.560 align:start position:0%
paid for instance to that school
 
02:12:27.990 --> 02:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
district so it could be that they've
 
02:12:29.589 --> 02:12:29.599 align:start position:0%
simply not um
 
02:12:31.750 --> 02:12:31.760 align:start position:0%
you know either spent it's not paid at
 
02:12:32.870 --> 02:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
this point because they haven't asked
 
02:12:34.390 --> 02:12:34.400 align:start position:0%
for reimbursement once they ask for
 
02:12:35.910 --> 02:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
reimbursement then it will show up in
 
02:12:38.069 --> 02:12:38.079 align:start position:0%
the paid column but it could be that
 
02:12:39.350 --> 02:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
they are you know maybe they're
 
02:12:41.189 --> 02:12:41.199 align:start position:0%
allocating those funds for a
 
02:12:42.550 --> 02:12:42.560 align:start position:0%
construction project and they haven't
 
02:12:44.709 --> 02:12:44.719 align:start position:0%
started yet and so once they get started
 
02:12:46.870 --> 02:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
then we'll get the invoices for that all
 
02:12:48.550 --> 02:12:48.560 align:start position:0%
right thanks
 
02:12:51.030 --> 02:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
thanks madam chair uh thank you
 
02:12:51.040 --> 02:12:55.350 align:start position:0%
thanks madam chair uh thank you
uh

02:12:55.360 --> 02:12:56.069 align:start position:0%
 
i

02:12:56.069 --> 02:12:56.079 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:12:57.910 --> 02:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
i'm also
 
02:13:00.790 --> 02:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
when does the s for one money run out
 
02:13:04.550 --> 02:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
to one expires in september 22.
 
02:13:06.629 --> 02:13:06.639 align:start position:0%
so like that's three months away that is
 
02:13:09.350 --> 02:13:09.360 align:start position:0%
three months away okay
 
02:13:11.830 --> 02:13:11.840 align:start position:0%
do the schools understand that they do
 
02:13:13.910 --> 02:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
we continuously are providing that
 
02:13:15.669 --> 02:13:15.679 align:start position:0%
information and reporting to them yeah
 
02:13:18.390 --> 02:13:18.400 align:start position:0%
well obviously they
 
02:13:19.990 --> 02:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
okay because they're pretty i mean you
 
02:13:21.669 --> 02:13:21.679 align:start position:0%
know spent they've already drawn down
 
02:13:23.910 --> 02:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
you know 30 out of 33 and it could be
 
02:13:25.189 --> 02:13:25.199 align:start position:0%
that they're sitting on reimbursements
 
02:13:26.390 --> 02:13:26.400 align:start position:0%
and those are gonna you know in
 
02:13:27.589 --> 02:13:27.599 align:start position:0%
september we'll get a whole bunch of
 
02:13:31.270 --> 02:13:31.280 align:start position:0%
bills to put to process okay okay
 
02:13:33.350 --> 02:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
okay and melissa is just pointing out uh
 
02:13:34.709 --> 02:13:34.719 align:start position:0%
that many of them are using that for
 
02:13:36.470 --> 02:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
summer programming and and i have to
 
02:13:38.470 --> 02:13:38.480 align:start position:0%
apologize i failed to introduce who was
 
02:13:40.790 --> 02:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
with me today so melissa white and by
 
02:13:42.149 --> 02:13:42.159 align:start position:0%
the way i'm happy to introduce her is
 
02:13:45.189 --> 02:13:45.199 align:start position:0%
our uh newly minted uh director of the
 
02:13:47.270 --> 02:13:47.280 align:start position:0%
division of learner support
 
02:13:49.189 --> 02:13:49.199 align:start position:0%
and jessica lescarbo is our program
 
02:13:51.589 --> 02:13:51.599 align:start position:0%
administrator for our kobe relief funds
 
02:13:53.830 --> 02:13:53.840 align:start position:0%
okay thank you and i apologize for not
 
02:13:55.669 --> 02:13:55.679 align:start position:0%
introducing them in the beginning no no
 
02:13:58.470 --> 02:13:58.480 align:start position:0%
problem i'm apologizing to them oh okay
 
02:14:03.750 --> 02:14:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:07.750 --> 02:14:07.760 align:start position:0%
i realize that our esra 3 money
 
02:14:10.830 --> 02:14:10.840 align:start position:0%
that doesn't expire until 24
 
02:14:13.350 --> 02:14:13.360 align:start position:0%
24 so
 
02:14:15.189 --> 02:14:15.199 align:start position:0%
i understand that the school systems
 
02:14:16.870 --> 02:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
supposedly are
 
02:14:19.830 --> 02:14:19.840 align:start position:0%
spending their one one and two money
 
02:14:22.149 --> 02:14:22.159 align:start position:0%
and then will
 
02:14:24.069 --> 02:14:24.079 align:start position:0%
that is what we're encouraging yes yeah
 
02:14:24.079 --> 02:14:24.950 align:start position:0%
that is what we're encouraging yes yeah
okay

02:14:24.950 --> 02:14:24.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:14:24.960 --> 02:14:27.350 align:start position:0%
okay
okay

02:14:27.350 --> 02:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:14:28.390 --> 02:14:28.400 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:14:30.950 --> 02:14:30.960 align:start position:0%
and then all of this just shows
 
02:14:32.149 --> 02:14:32.159 align:start position:0%
where they
 
02:14:33.669 --> 02:14:33.679 align:start position:0%
where they are
 
02:14:35.270 --> 02:14:35.280 align:start position:0%
right and then i just broke down by each
 
02:14:36.950 --> 02:14:36.960 align:start position:0%
grant you have a consolidated is the
 
02:14:38.950 --> 02:14:38.960 align:start position:0%
first page of the hand the school
 
02:14:40.550 --> 02:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
district handout and then a separate
 
02:14:42.229 --> 02:14:42.239 align:start position:0%
page for each of the individual grants
 
02:14:44.069 --> 02:14:44.079 align:start position:0%
if you want to see it by school district
 
02:14:44.079 --> 02:14:45.109 align:start position:0%
if you want to see it by school district
okay

02:14:45.109 --> 02:14:45.119 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:14:45.119 --> 02:14:47.270 align:start position:0%
okay
okay

02:14:47.270 --> 02:14:47.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:14:50.069 --> 02:14:50.079 align:start position:0%
so you you allocate this then they use
 
02:14:52.550 --> 02:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
this money correct whatever it is and
 
02:14:54.629 --> 02:14:54.639 align:start position:0%
what your allocation formula
 
02:14:56.790 --> 02:14:56.800 align:start position:0%
it's basic we get the allocations from
 
02:14:58.229 --> 02:14:58.239 align:start position:0%
the federal government it's based on a
 
02:14:59.830 --> 02:14:59.840 align:start position:0%
title one formula
 
02:15:01.910 --> 02:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
oh so the same title one formula that
 
02:15:03.350 --> 02:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
same formula that's used to allocate
 
02:15:05.109 --> 02:15:05.119 align:start position:0%
title one funds to the schools is the
 
02:15:06.950 --> 02:15:06.960 align:start position:0%
same formula so that's how the esra
 
02:15:08.870 --> 02:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
money was passed through to the school
 
02:15:12.069 --> 02:15:12.079 align:start position:0%
pass through based on title one yes okay
 
02:15:14.069 --> 02:15:14.079 align:start position:0%
i didn't know that sorry about that yeah
 
02:15:16.149 --> 02:15:16.159 align:start position:0%
that's quite all right
 
02:15:19.669 --> 02:15:19.679 align:start position:0%
okay are there any further questions
 
02:15:22.550 --> 02:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
seeing none we will uh i thank you for
 
02:15:24.149 --> 02:15:24.159 align:start position:0%
this and
 
02:15:26.629 --> 02:15:26.639 align:start position:0%
i'm sure we'll have an opportunity for
 
02:15:28.390 --> 02:15:28.400 align:start position:0%
an update later on that would be great
 
02:15:29.830 --> 02:15:29.840 align:start position:0%
and hopefully the website will be online
 
02:15:31.510 --> 02:15:31.520 align:start position:0%
at that point in time and you can just
 
02:15:33.669 --> 02:15:33.679 align:start position:0%
go browse it yeah like i have nothing
 
02:15:39.270 --> 02:15:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:42.149 --> 02:15:42.159 align:start position:0%
okay department of transportation
 
02:15:44.229 --> 02:15:44.239 align:start position:0%
looking forward to
 
02:16:14.069 --> 02:16:14.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:15.750 --> 02:16:15.760 align:start position:0%
oh you don't have to leave you might
 
02:16:18.709 --> 02:16:18.719 align:start position:0%
want to hear about diode
 
02:16:19.990 --> 02:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:16:22.629 --> 02:16:22.639 align:start position:0%
you probably have a pothole in your road
 
02:16:25.990 --> 02:16:26.000 align:start position:0%
someplace so all right nope no fixing
 
02:16:28.470 --> 02:16:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:29.990 --> 02:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
i know they'll be watching online this
 
02:16:34.150 --> 02:16:34.160 align:start position:0%
is must-see tv so you know
 
02:16:37.349 --> 02:16:37.359 align:start position:0%
as much as you make fun you would not
 
02:16:37.359 --> 02:16:38.709 align:start position:0%
as much as you make fun you would not
believe

02:16:38.709 --> 02:16:38.719 align:start position:0%
believe
 
02:16:40.549 --> 02:16:40.559 align:start position:0%
the number of people
 
02:16:40.559 --> 02:16:41.349 align:start position:0%
the number of people
that

02:16:41.349 --> 02:16:41.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:16:43.990 --> 02:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
tune into this we have an engaged
 
02:16:47.270 --> 02:16:47.280 align:start position:0%
electorate yes we do yes we do madam
 
02:16:49.270 --> 02:16:49.280 align:start position:0%
chair uh thank you for inviting us here

unfortunately she is under the weather
 
02:17:03.669 --> 02:17:03.679 align:start position:0%
but i'm sure she is watching
 
02:17:05.190 --> 02:17:05.200 align:start position:0%
so good afternoon to commissioner
 
02:17:06.870 --> 02:17:06.880 align:start position:0%
sheehan out there
 
02:17:09.349 --> 02:17:09.359 align:start position:0%
i also brought our director of finance
 
02:17:11.349 --> 02:17:11.359 align:start position:0%
marie mullen who's to my left and she'll
 
02:17:13.750 --> 02:17:13.760 align:start position:0%
be talking about specific numbers as
 
02:17:15.190 --> 02:17:15.200 align:start position:0%
well as
 
02:17:17.589 --> 02:17:17.599 align:start position:0%
representatives from our aviation and
 
02:17:20.070 --> 02:17:20.080 align:start position:0%
transit bureaus
 
02:17:22.230 --> 02:17:22.240 align:start position:0%
who are right behind me and they're here
 
02:17:24.230 --> 02:17:24.240 align:start position:0%
to answer any specific questions about
 
02:17:26.389 --> 02:17:26.399 align:start position:0%
spending in those areas
 
02:17:29.589 --> 02:17:29.599 align:start position:0%
of their responsibility uh but overall
 
02:17:32.709 --> 02:17:32.719 align:start position:0%
our arpa cares and chris expenditures
 
02:17:36.070 --> 02:17:36.080 align:start position:0%
are all responsive to the very real uh
 
02:17:39.190 --> 02:17:39.200 align:start position:0%
decrease in uh ridership passenger
 
02:17:39.200 --> 02:17:40.389 align:start position:0%
decrease in uh ridership passenger
volume

02:17:40.389 --> 02:17:40.399 align:start position:0%
volume
 
02:17:43.030 --> 02:17:43.040 align:start position:0%
uh as well as impacts to our highway
 
02:17:44.469 --> 02:17:44.479 align:start position:0%
fund that we experienced through the
 
02:17:44.479 --> 02:17:45.910 align:start position:0%
fund that we experienced through the
pandemic

02:17:45.910 --> 02:17:45.920 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
02:17:47.750 --> 02:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
on the transit side were roughly
 
02:17:50.070 --> 02:17:50.080 align:start position:0%
two-thirds of the passenger volume that
 
02:17:52.790 --> 02:17:52.800 align:start position:0%
we were pre-pandemic that's very uneven
 
02:17:55.030 --> 02:17:55.040 align:start position:0%
there are certain segments that are as
 
02:17:58.150 --> 02:17:58.160 align:start position:0%
low as a third of the ridership still
 
02:18:00.950 --> 02:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
on the aviation side tsa tells us we're
 
02:18:02.790 --> 02:18:02.800 align:start position:0%
about 88
 
02:18:04.790 --> 02:18:04.800 align:start position:0%
of pre-pandemic passenger volume that
 
02:18:08.070 --> 02:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
seems to be recovering much quicker
 
02:18:11.589 --> 02:18:11.599 align:start position:0%
but each of these uh types of money is
 
02:18:13.750 --> 02:18:13.760 align:start position:0%
allocated in slightly different ways and
 
02:18:15.669 --> 02:18:15.679 align:start position:0%
at slightly different levels of
 
02:18:18.230 --> 02:18:18.240 align:start position:0%
expenditure so for details on that i'm
 
02:18:19.830 --> 02:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
going to pass it to my colleague marie
 
02:18:19.840 --> 02:18:23.429 align:start position:0%
going to pass it to my colleague marie
mullen

02:18:23.429 --> 02:18:23.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:28.549 --> 02:18:28.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:31.429 --> 02:18:31.439 align:start position:0%
are we expecting
 
02:18:31.439 --> 02:18:33.589 align:start position:0%
are we expecting
ridership

02:18:33.589 --> 02:18:33.599 align:start position:0%
ridership
 
02:18:36.230 --> 02:18:36.240 align:start position:0%
on buses to increase
 
02:18:39.110 --> 02:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
with the gas
 
02:18:41.190 --> 02:18:41.200 align:start position:0%
traditionally uh madam chair that's what
 
02:18:44.950 --> 02:18:44.960 align:start position:0%
we see uh and we met not too uh long ago
 
02:18:46.870 --> 02:18:46.880 align:start position:0%
with uh leadership from boston express
 
02:18:48.389 --> 02:18:48.399 align:start position:0%
that was a specific question i asked
 
02:18:51.110 --> 02:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
them is the previous iteration of this
 
02:18:53.030 --> 02:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
really back in the 08 time frame what
 
02:18:54.150 --> 02:18:54.160 align:start position:0%
did you see
 
02:18:55.429 --> 02:18:55.439 align:start position:0%
in terms of ridership and it was a
 
02:18:57.349 --> 02:18:57.359 align:start position:0%
dramatic increase
 
02:18:57.359 --> 02:18:58.469 align:start position:0%
dramatic increase
so

02:18:58.469 --> 02:18:58.479 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:18:59.830 --> 02:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
there have been some trend lines that
 
02:19:02.950 --> 02:19:02.960 align:start position:0%
are encouraging um we
 
02:19:05.429 --> 02:19:05.439 align:start position:0%
you never hope for high gas prices but
 
02:19:07.270 --> 02:19:07.280 align:start position:0%
the one area that it can benefit is
 
02:19:09.190 --> 02:19:09.200 align:start position:0%
transit ridership so we do
 
02:19:11.509 --> 02:19:11.519 align:start position:0%
uh hope and expect to see an impact from
 
02:19:13.910 --> 02:19:13.920 align:start position:0%
that whether it goes all the way is just
 
02:19:15.669 --> 02:19:15.679 align:start position:0%
remains to be seen and we'll we'll see
 
02:19:16.950 --> 02:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
over time
 
02:19:19.669 --> 02:19:19.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:22.150 --> 02:19:22.160 align:start position:0%
all right thank you and good afternoon
 
02:19:25.190 --> 02:19:25.200 align:start position:0%
so the first page of our presentation
 
02:19:27.910 --> 02:19:27.920 align:start position:0%
is a review of our federal highway fund
 
02:19:30.709 --> 02:19:30.719 align:start position:0%
so these funds were apportioned
 
02:19:32.549 --> 02:19:32.559 align:start position:0%
to the state of new hampshire based on
 
02:19:35.190 --> 02:19:35.200 align:start position:0%
the federal highway allocation so
 
02:19:37.830 --> 02:19:37.840 align:start position:0%
as division ii is well aware the state
 
02:19:39.830 --> 02:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire has the lowest
 
02:19:41.669 --> 02:19:41.679 align:start position:0%
allocation of federal highway funds in
 
02:19:44.389 --> 02:19:44.399 align:start position:0%
the country so again our stimulus funds
 
02:19:46.629 --> 02:19:46.639 align:start position:0%
were the lowest in the country but we
 
02:19:49.750 --> 02:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
were apportioned 41 million dollars and
 
02:19:51.670 --> 02:19:51.680 align:start position:0%
those on division two also remember the
 
02:19:53.590 --> 02:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
during the budget process
 
02:19:56.710 --> 02:19:56.720 align:start position:0%
these funds were budgeted in our 2223
 
02:19:59.270 --> 02:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
budget to supplant highway funds
 
02:20:01.190 --> 02:20:01.200 align:start position:0%
as the highway funds had some
 
02:20:03.750 --> 02:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
significant revenue shortages there
 
02:20:03.760 --> 02:20:04.950 align:start position:0%
significant revenue shortages there
so

02:20:04.950 --> 02:20:04.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:20:07.510 --> 02:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
those were input to cover our highway
 
02:20:10.070 --> 02:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
maintenance costs so approximately 41
 
02:20:13.030 --> 02:20:13.040 align:start position:0%
million over 22 and 23. and so you can
 
02:20:15.110 --> 02:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
see here what we've expended so far
 
02:20:17.349 --> 02:20:17.359 align:start position:0%
through fiscal year 22
 
02:20:19.910 --> 02:20:19.920 align:start position:0%
is about 31 million dollars and we
 
02:20:21.830 --> 02:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
anticipate the rest of the remaining
 
02:20:24.309 --> 02:20:24.319 align:start position:0%
balance to be drawn down uh in the
 
02:20:25.910 --> 02:20:25.920 align:start position:0%
within the first quarter of fiscal year
 
02:20:28.790 --> 02:20:28.800 align:start position:0%
23 and then we'll have
 
02:20:31.429 --> 02:20:31.439 align:start position:0%
drawn down the full 41 million of these
 
02:20:33.990 --> 02:20:34.000 align:start position:0%
this allocation
 
02:20:36.309 --> 02:20:36.319 align:start position:0%
of chris of funds any questions on the
 
02:20:40.790 --> 02:20:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:43.030 --> 02:20:43.040 align:start position:0%
yes represent senator rosenwald thank
 
02:20:46.230 --> 02:20:46.240 align:start position:0%
you i've had constituents asking me
 
02:20:46.240 --> 02:20:47.670 align:start position:0%
you i've had constituents asking me
recently

02:20:47.670 --> 02:20:47.680 align:start position:0%
recently
 
02:20:51.270 --> 02:20:51.280 align:start position:0%
when concord coach is going to restart
 
02:20:54.230 --> 02:20:54.240 align:start position:0%
their bus service to new york city
 
02:20:56.150 --> 02:20:56.160 align:start position:0%
and i wonder if
 
02:21:02.389 --> 02:21:02.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:03.349 --> 02:21:03.359 align:start position:0%
in the public transportation
 
02:21:03.359 --> 02:21:05.910 align:start position:0%
in the public transportation
administration

02:21:05.910 --> 02:21:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:07.990 --> 02:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
so that commissioner sheehan can hear it
 
02:21:14.950 --> 02:21:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:17.110 --> 02:21:17.120 align:start position:0%
the only reason you need to use the mic
 
02:21:19.910 --> 02:21:19.920 align:start position:0%
is because it is on the streaming
 
02:21:19.920 --> 02:21:21.110 align:start position:0%
is because it is on the streaming
streaming

02:21:21.110 --> 02:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
streaming
 
02:21:23.349 --> 02:21:23.359 align:start position:0%
and if you're not using the mic
 
02:21:26.230 --> 02:21:26.240 align:start position:0%
out there they can't hear you i
 
02:21:27.990 --> 02:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
understand yes um
 
02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:28.950 align:start position:0%
understand yes um
yes

02:21:28.950 --> 02:21:28.960 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:21:28.960 --> 02:21:29.830 align:start position:0%
yes
coach

02:21:29.830 --> 02:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
coach
 
02:21:31.670 --> 02:21:31.680 align:start position:0%
it is it is on their radar they have
 
02:21:33.190 --> 02:21:33.200 align:start position:0%
plans to
 
02:21:35.030 --> 02:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
reinstate that service to new york city
 
02:21:36.950 --> 02:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
they don't have a
 
02:21:39.510 --> 02:21:39.520 align:start position:0%
i'm not aware of a definite date
 
02:21:39.520 --> 02:21:40.389 align:start position:0%
i'm not aware of a definite date
um

02:21:40.389 --> 02:21:40.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:21:42.230 --> 02:21:42.240 align:start position:0%
they are
 
02:21:44.309 --> 02:21:44.319 align:start position:0%
they're hedging that against a lot of
 
02:21:44.319 --> 02:21:46.870 align:start position:0%
they're hedging that against a lot of
other

02:21:46.870 --> 02:21:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:48.950 --> 02:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
their core service what they consider
 
02:21:50.870 --> 02:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
going down to boston and
 
02:21:53.190 --> 02:21:53.200 align:start position:0%
uh but it is it is in the works as far
 
02:21:56.230 --> 02:21:56.240 align:start position:0%
as i know thank you i hope you can
 
02:21:58.630 --> 02:21:58.640 align:start position:0%
try to pin them down on yeah we'll do
 
02:22:00.150 --> 02:22:00.160 align:start position:0%
our data and later we'll follow up and
 
02:22:02.309 --> 02:22:02.319 align:start position:0%
get a more definite answer as well sure
 
02:22:04.790 --> 02:22:04.800 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and if i could add
 
02:22:07.270 --> 02:22:07.280 align:start position:0%
one thing to that answer and that is uh
 
02:22:08.630 --> 02:22:08.640 align:start position:0%
it's a good i'm sorry but you don't need
 
02:22:11.429 --> 02:22:11.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:13.670 --> 02:22:13.680 align:start position:0%
there is a kind of a multi-headed hydra
 
02:22:16.230 --> 02:22:16.240 align:start position:0%
here right so it's not just decreased
 
02:22:17.670 --> 02:22:17.680 align:start position:0%
ridership that we're dealing with with
 
02:22:19.670 --> 02:22:19.680 align:start position:0%
our transit providers also
 
02:22:21.270 --> 02:22:21.280 align:start position:0%
as the committee is well aware a
 
02:22:23.990 --> 02:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
shortage of cdl drivers
 
02:22:26.230 --> 02:22:26.240 align:start position:0%
and the increasingly competitive market
 
02:22:28.550 --> 02:22:28.560 align:start position:0%
for those drivers in our region so those
 
02:22:30.630 --> 02:22:30.640 align:start position:0%
are really the two things that that
 
02:22:32.790 --> 02:22:32.800 align:start position:0%
they're struggling with and
 
02:22:34.550 --> 02:22:34.560 align:start position:0%
and i know every transit provider is in
 
02:22:36.550 --> 02:22:36.560 align:start position:0%
that same boat so they're they're going
 
02:22:38.630 --> 02:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
to operate just as quickly as they can
 
02:22:42.469 --> 02:22:42.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:44.309 --> 02:22:44.319 align:start position:0%
senator d'alessandro did you have a
 
02:22:44.319 --> 02:22:45.590 align:start position:0%
senator d'alessandro did you have a
question

02:22:45.590 --> 02:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:22:47.750 --> 02:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah i would if by not by not
 
02:22:49.990 --> 02:22:50.000 align:start position:0%
having complete service do we anyway
 
02:22:51.990 --> 02:22:52.000 align:start position:0%
mitigate the mitigation plan that we
 
02:22:53.349 --> 02:22:53.359 align:start position:0%
have in place i mean that's why these
 
02:22:55.190 --> 02:22:55.200 align:start position:0%
buses are running right that's why the
 
02:22:57.110 --> 02:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
federal government's paying us
 
02:22:59.750 --> 02:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
we're mitigating
 
02:23:03.990 --> 02:23:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:05.750 --> 02:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
thanks for the question senator so yeah
 
02:23:07.190 --> 02:23:07.200 align:start position:0%
i mean in terms of
 
02:23:08.790 --> 02:23:08.800 align:start position:0%
i guess in the sense of if you build it
 
02:23:10.309 --> 02:23:10.319 align:start position:0%
they will come if you have if you have
 
02:23:11.429 --> 02:23:11.439 align:start position:0%
the service you're going to get more
 
02:23:13.670 --> 02:23:13.680 align:start position:0%
ridership if you limit that service
 
02:23:15.910 --> 02:23:15.920 align:start position:0%
you turn off ridership and yeah that's a
 
02:23:17.830 --> 02:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
that's a dynamic that our transit
 
02:23:20.070 --> 02:23:20.080 align:start position:0%
providers are well aware of which is why
 
02:23:21.510 --> 02:23:21.520 align:start position:0%
they're they're trying to maximize
 
02:23:23.590 --> 02:23:23.600 align:start position:0%
routes they've done a pretty darn good
 
02:23:26.230 --> 02:23:26.240 align:start position:0%
job through the pandemic uh some heroic
 
02:23:29.030 --> 02:23:29.040 align:start position:0%
efforts uh to maintain those routes they
 
02:23:31.270 --> 02:23:31.280 align:start position:0%
continue to do so but but yeah they're
 
02:23:34.550 --> 02:23:34.560 align:start position:0%
very sensitive to and cognizant of
 
02:23:36.150 --> 02:23:36.160 align:start position:0%
decreased services and trying to
 
02:23:38.150 --> 02:23:38.160 align:start position:0%
minimize those and and uh expand
 
02:23:40.790 --> 02:23:40.800 align:start position:0%
services as quickly as they can
 
02:23:42.389 --> 02:23:42.399 align:start position:0%
for the point of change certainly
 
02:23:45.110 --> 02:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
because we did the golfer committee did
 
02:23:47.429 --> 02:23:47.439 align:start position:0%
allocate seven million dollars of
 
02:23:49.830 --> 02:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
subsidy for that program you know to
 
02:23:52.150 --> 02:23:52.160 align:start position:0%
keep it going
 
02:23:54.070 --> 02:23:54.080 align:start position:0%
yeah private the private inner city bus
 
02:23:57.750 --> 02:23:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:57.760 --> 02:23:59.030 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:23:59.030 --> 02:23:59.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:24:00.550 --> 02:24:00.560 align:start position:0%
oh one more yes
 
02:24:04.150 --> 02:24:04.160 align:start position:0%
represent senator roosevelt um some
 
02:24:07.510 --> 02:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
number of fiscal meetings ago we
 
02:24:11.429 --> 02:24:11.439 align:start position:0%
approved money to pay like an incentive
 
02:24:15.110 --> 02:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
to um cdl drivers
 
02:24:17.510 --> 02:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
do you know what the impact or the
 
02:24:23.750 --> 02:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:25.750 --> 02:24:25.760 align:start position:0%
uh i don't think that that went through
 
02:24:25.760 --> 02:24:27.429 align:start position:0%
uh i don't think that that went through
d.o.t

02:24:27.429 --> 02:24:27.439 align:start position:0%
d.o.t
 
02:24:29.270 --> 02:24:29.280 align:start position:0%
yeah those are those are your not for
 
02:24:31.270 --> 02:24:31.280 align:start position:0%
the transit cdl's are you taught you're
 
02:24:33.670 --> 02:24:33.680 align:start position:0%
talking about for for the uh we have a
 
02:24:36.230 --> 02:24:36.240 align:start position:0%
cdl training program that has been uh
 
02:24:39.190 --> 02:24:39.200 align:start position:0%
very successful in in training our folks
 
02:24:39.990 --> 02:24:40.000 align:start position:0%
and that
 
02:24:41.510 --> 02:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
and i want to make sure i'm i'm
 
02:24:42.950 --> 02:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
addressing the same thing that you're
 
02:24:44.630 --> 02:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
asking but this was
 
02:24:47.349 --> 02:24:47.359 align:start position:0%
you're talking about the program to uh
 
02:24:48.550 --> 02:24:48.560 align:start position:0%
to help our winner maintenance by
 
02:24:50.550 --> 02:24:50.560 align:start position:0%
training cdl drivers and establishing
 
02:24:53.030 --> 02:24:53.040 align:start position:0%
that training program no no something
 
02:24:55.110 --> 02:24:55.120 align:start position:0%
different no okay i think it was an
 
02:24:58.230 --> 02:24:58.240 align:start position:0%
incentive it was a program to recruit
 
02:24:58.240 --> 02:24:59.429 align:start position:0%
incentive it was a program to recruit
new

02:24:59.429 --> 02:24:59.439 align:start position:0%
new
 
02:24:59.439 --> 02:25:00.790 align:start position:0%
new
cdl

02:25:00.790 --> 02:25:00.800 align:start position:0%
cdl
 
02:25:04.950 --> 02:25:04.960 align:start position:0%
applicants to increase the pool of
 
02:25:07.990 --> 02:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
cdl that did not go through d.o.t it
 
02:25:11.750 --> 02:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
must have gone through another agency
 
02:25:14.070 --> 02:25:14.080 align:start position:0%
or another agency that so i mean we
 
02:25:15.830 --> 02:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
could okay follow up but i don't believe
 
02:25:18.150 --> 02:25:18.160 align:start position:0%
that's through dot yeah well maybe we
 
02:25:20.870 --> 02:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
could have mr kane follow up with safety
 
02:25:21.990 --> 02:25:22.000 align:start position:0%
and see
 
02:25:24.309 --> 02:25:24.319 align:start position:0%
what that progress is because it
 
02:25:28.550 --> 02:25:28.560 align:start position:0%
obviously they go hand in hand
 
02:25:32.230 --> 02:25:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:34.710 --> 02:25:34.720 align:start position:0%
all right so to continue the second page
 
02:25:36.630 --> 02:25:36.640 align:start position:0%
is a summary of our
 
02:25:36.640 --> 02:25:38.630 align:start position:0%
is a summary of our
transit

02:25:38.630 --> 02:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
transit
 
02:25:40.230 --> 02:25:40.240 align:start position:0%
funds so these
 
02:25:42.070 --> 02:25:42.080 align:start position:0%
come through the federal transit
 
02:25:44.550 --> 02:25:44.560 align:start position:0%
administration fta again these are
 
02:25:46.950 --> 02:25:46.960 align:start position:0%
apportioned funds that come to the state
 
02:25:49.429 --> 02:25:49.439 align:start position:0%
except for the the first column there
 
02:25:51.750 --> 02:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
the gopher funds those were part of the
 
02:25:53.990 --> 02:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
the cares act distribution that came
 
02:25:55.990 --> 02:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
directly to the state as senator
 
02:25:59.030 --> 02:25:59.040 align:start position:0%
rosenwald was indicating um or maybe it
 
02:26:00.710 --> 02:26:00.720 align:start position:0%
was senator d'alessandro seven and a
 
02:26:03.510 --> 02:26:03.520 align:start position:0%
half million from that gopher account
 
02:26:05.270 --> 02:26:05.280 align:start position:0%
for the cares act funds
 
02:26:07.830 --> 02:26:07.840 align:start position:0%
were provided to uh inter-city and
 
02:26:10.070 --> 02:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
commuter bus operators to assist them in
 
02:26:12.630 --> 02:26:12.640 align:start position:0%
resuming services and these were spent
 
02:26:15.830 --> 02:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
by the deadline in december of 2020
 
02:26:17.110 --> 02:26:17.120 align:start position:0%
and so you can see the three bus
 
02:26:20.150 --> 02:26:20.160 align:start position:0%
operators there that receive those funds
 
02:26:22.710 --> 02:26:22.720 align:start position:0%
the so this was the the your first your
 
02:26:25.190 --> 02:26:25.200 align:start position:0%
gopher column is cares
 
02:26:30.870 --> 02:26:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:33.190 --> 02:26:33.200 align:start position:0%
and then the the next column over were
 
02:26:35.830 --> 02:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
the cares act funds that were directly
 
02:26:38.309 --> 02:26:38.319 align:start position:0%
apportioned to dot through the ft
 
02:26:40.150 --> 02:26:40.160 align:start position:0%
through fta
 
02:26:41.349 --> 02:26:41.359 align:start position:0%
and those
 
02:26:43.750 --> 02:26:43.760 align:start position:0%
funds were apportioned and allocated by
 
02:26:45.990 --> 02:26:46.000 align:start position:0%
state again to support operating capital
 
02:26:48.309 --> 02:26:48.319 align:start position:0%
and other expenses to help mitigate the
 
02:26:50.230 --> 02:26:50.240 align:start position:0%
effects of the pandemic on transit
 
02:26:50.240 --> 02:26:51.670 align:start position:0%
effects of the pandemic on transit
services

02:26:51.670 --> 02:26:51.680 align:start position:0%
services
 
02:26:53.910 --> 02:26:53.920 align:start position:0%
funds have been utilized to supplement
 
02:26:56.710 --> 02:26:56.720 align:start position:0%
losses in net operating expenses as well
 
02:26:59.670 --> 02:26:59.680 align:start position:0%
as support to covert related ppe
 
02:27:01.510 --> 02:27:01.520 align:start position:0%
cleaning and other
 
02:27:04.309 --> 02:27:04.319 align:start position:0%
necessities during the the covid crisis
 
02:27:04.319 --> 02:27:05.190 align:start position:0%
necessities during the the covid crisis
so

02:27:05.190 --> 02:27:05.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:27:06.710 --> 02:27:06.720 align:start position:0%
um and
 
02:27:09.190 --> 02:27:09.200 align:start position:0%
so the cares act the krisa and the arp
 
02:27:12.309 --> 02:27:12.319 align:start position:0%
funds are are all apportioned and used
 
02:27:14.230 --> 02:27:14.240 align:start position:0%
for those purposes to
 
02:27:16.150 --> 02:27:16.160 align:start position:0%
assist with their operating expenses as
 
02:27:19.030 --> 02:27:19.040 align:start position:0%
well as ppe and those type of things and
 
02:27:21.110 --> 02:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
so we have the breakdown here
 
02:27:24.309 --> 02:27:24.319 align:start position:0%
by transit agency um and how much
 
02:27:27.110 --> 02:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
they've received um what's programmed
 
02:27:29.190 --> 02:27:29.200 align:start position:0%
and then expended and they do need to
 
02:27:29.200 --> 02:27:30.870 align:start position:0%
and then expended and they do need to
provide

02:27:30.870 --> 02:27:30.880 align:start position:0%
provide
 
02:27:30.880 --> 02:27:31.990 align:start position:0%
provide
backup

02:27:31.990 --> 02:27:32.000 align:start position:0%
backup
 
02:27:33.830 --> 02:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
to these
 
02:27:36.630 --> 02:27:36.640 align:start position:0%
expenditures for these to be distributed
 
02:27:38.150 --> 02:27:38.160 align:start position:0%
back to them so
 
02:27:38.160 --> 02:27:39.270 align:start position:0%
back to them so
um

02:27:39.270 --> 02:27:39.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:27:41.030 --> 02:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
you could see the the bottom line there
 
02:27:43.990 --> 02:27:44.000 align:start position:0%
there's a reserve for future eligible
 
02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:45.030 align:start position:0%
there's a reserve for future eligible
commuter

02:27:45.030 --> 02:27:45.040 align:start position:0%
commuter
 
02:27:47.750 --> 02:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
city bus services so these are funds
 
02:27:49.590 --> 02:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
right now that haven't been identified
 
02:27:52.630 --> 02:27:52.640 align:start position:0%
but they have to be spent by 2029 so
 
02:27:55.270 --> 02:27:55.280 align:start position:0%
these are funds that are there and as
 
02:27:57.750 --> 02:27:57.760 align:start position:0%
the bus providers you know we're looking
 
02:28:00.389 --> 02:28:00.399 align:start position:0%
at ridership their operating expenses
 
02:28:03.110 --> 02:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
um those will be allocated at that point
 
02:28:04.950 --> 02:28:04.960 align:start position:0%
once it's been determined that the need
 
02:28:06.950 --> 02:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
is there
 
02:28:09.510 --> 02:28:09.520 align:start position:0%
and so your your column is called cares
 
02:28:10.830 --> 02:28:10.840 align:start position:0%
act when is
 
02:28:13.670 --> 02:28:13.680 align:start position:0%
that expire
 
02:28:15.830 --> 02:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
so the cares act um
 
02:28:17.910 --> 02:28:17.920 align:start position:0%
goes until expended but we believe we'll
 
02:28:20.150 --> 02:28:20.160 align:start position:0%
have expended those by 2024 so the
 
02:28:22.150 --> 02:28:22.160 align:start position:0%
additional 11 million dollar balance
 
02:28:23.750 --> 02:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
there those will be expended in the next
 
02:28:26.469 --> 02:28:26.479 align:start position:0%
two years so transportation is different
 
02:28:28.950 --> 02:28:28.960 align:start position:0%
than everybody else
 
02:28:30.790 --> 02:28:30.800 align:start position:0%
yeah these these were specifically
 
02:28:33.270 --> 02:28:33.280 align:start position:0%
broken out in the act going directly to
 
02:28:35.910 --> 02:28:35.920 align:start position:0%
fta and part of the apportioned programs
 
02:28:37.590 --> 02:28:37.600 align:start position:0%
and there's several different programs
 
02:28:39.590 --> 02:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
within you know the elderly no i just
 
02:28:41.349 --> 02:28:41.359 align:start position:0%
met that i meant the deadline for
 
02:28:44.230 --> 02:28:44.240 align:start position:0%
spending yes yes this is wonderful thank
 
02:28:48.710 --> 02:28:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:50.710 --> 02:28:50.720 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions on the the
 
02:28:56.150 --> 02:28:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:56.160 --> 02:28:57.030 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:28:57.030 --> 02:28:57.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:28:59.190 --> 02:28:59.200 align:start position:0%
so then uh the next page the next five
 
02:29:01.510 --> 02:29:01.520 align:start position:0%
pages are related to our
 
02:29:04.150 --> 02:29:04.160 align:start position:0%
aviation and aeronautics program so
 
02:29:06.630 --> 02:29:06.640 align:start position:0%
again these are funds uh directly
 
02:29:09.110 --> 02:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
apportioned to this to the state and to
 
02:29:11.510 --> 02:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
dot through faa through the federal
 
02:29:13.429 --> 02:29:13.439 align:start position:0%
aviation administration
 
02:29:17.110 --> 02:29:17.120 align:start position:0%
um this first page here details out um
 
02:29:20.070 --> 02:29:20.080 align:start position:0%
cares act funds um in indicates group
 
02:29:23.110 --> 02:29:23.120 align:start position:0%
one which means these were for
 
02:29:24.230 --> 02:29:24.240 align:start position:0%
the 10
 
02:29:26.150 --> 02:29:26.160 align:start position:0%
match that is required on federal funds
 
02:29:28.389 --> 02:29:28.399 align:start position:0%
for capital projects so
 
02:29:31.750 --> 02:29:31.760 align:start position:0%
in in faa capital projects five percent
 
02:29:33.830 --> 02:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
match is required by the airport five
 
02:29:36.790 --> 02:29:36.800 align:start position:0%
percent is paid by the state so these
 
02:29:39.910 --> 02:29:39.920 align:start position:0%
funds um covered that state and local
 
02:29:42.630 --> 02:29:42.640 align:start position:0%
share of those capital projects and you
 
02:29:43.670 --> 02:29:43.680 align:start position:0%
can see
 
02:29:45.830 --> 02:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
um the amount of money and what's been
 
02:29:47.910 --> 02:29:47.920 align:start position:0%
expended and encumbered related to the
 
02:29:47.920 --> 02:29:48.710 align:start position:0%
expended and encumbered related to the
those

02:29:48.710 --> 02:29:48.720 align:start position:0%
those
 
02:29:50.070 --> 02:29:50.080 align:start position:0%
capital projects that have been
 
02:29:50.080 --> 02:29:52.630 align:start position:0%
capital projects that have been
identified

02:29:52.630 --> 02:29:52.640 align:start position:0%
identified
 
02:29:55.110 --> 02:29:55.120 align:start position:0%
those are cares act funds the next page
 
02:29:58.070 --> 02:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
are also cares act funds
 
02:29:59.590 --> 02:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
and these
 
02:30:01.910 --> 02:30:01.920 align:start position:0%
we have as group two to four these were
 
02:30:04.469 --> 02:30:04.479 align:start position:0%
issued for operations and maintenance
 
02:30:04.479 --> 02:30:05.349 align:start position:0%
issued for operations and maintenance
so

02:30:05.349 --> 02:30:05.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:30:07.830 --> 02:30:07.840 align:start position:0%
these are pass-through amounts that were
 
02:30:10.469 --> 02:30:10.479 align:start position:0%
specified by faa allocation so they had
 
02:30:10.479 --> 02:30:11.110 align:start position:0%
specified by faa allocation so they had
a

02:30:11.110 --> 02:30:11.120 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:30:13.349 --> 02:30:13.359 align:start position:0%
an allocation that they came up with
 
02:30:15.830 --> 02:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
and each airport was given a specific
 
02:30:18.550 --> 02:30:18.560 align:start position:0%
amount based on the allocation
 
02:30:20.550 --> 02:30:20.560 align:start position:0%
and they've had to identify the eligible
 
02:30:20.560 --> 02:30:21.830 align:start position:0%
and they've had to identify the eligible
expenses

02:30:21.830 --> 02:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
expenses
 
02:30:23.670 --> 02:30:23.680 align:start position:0%
and submit those
 
02:30:25.750 --> 02:30:25.760 align:start position:0%
and once they did they they received
 
02:30:27.990 --> 02:30:28.000 align:start position:0%
these funds that were apportioned by the
 
02:30:28.000 --> 02:30:31.670 align:start position:0%
these funds that were apportioned by the
faa

02:30:31.670 --> 02:30:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:33.910 --> 02:30:33.920 align:start position:0%
so you can see here nearly the nearly
 
02:30:36.710 --> 02:30:36.720 align:start position:0%
all of the 15.2 million has been
 
02:30:45.510 --> 02:30:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:47.510 --> 02:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
okay if there's no questions on that one
 
02:30:49.030 --> 02:30:49.040 align:start position:0%
the next um
 
02:30:52.950 --> 02:30:52.960 align:start position:0%
page are chrisa act funds for from faa
 
02:30:54.469 --> 02:30:54.479 align:start position:0%
um and these
 
02:30:56.790 --> 02:30:56.800 align:start position:0%
were a portion for operations
 
02:30:58.710 --> 02:30:58.720 align:start position:0%
maintenance and concessions
 
02:31:01.030 --> 02:31:01.040 align:start position:0%
so you can see a couple of the airports
 
02:31:02.870 --> 02:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
lebanon on the second line and
 
02:31:05.429 --> 02:31:05.439 align:start position:0%
manchester boston regional airport on
 
02:31:07.349 --> 02:31:07.359 align:start position:0%
the fifth line
 
02:31:10.070 --> 02:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
have indicated that they they're look
 
02:31:11.830 --> 02:31:11.840 align:start position:0%
they will be looking for some
 
02:31:14.630 --> 02:31:14.640 align:start position:0%
reimbursement for concessions and then
 
02:31:16.309 --> 02:31:16.319 align:start position:0%
operations maintenance on all of the
 
02:31:17.750 --> 02:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
other airports
 
02:31:19.510 --> 02:31:19.520 align:start position:0%
and again
 
02:31:21.110 --> 02:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
they need to provide
 
02:31:23.429 --> 02:31:23.439 align:start position:0%
you know eligible expenditures for these
 
02:31:24.870 --> 02:31:24.880 align:start position:0%
to go out so
 
02:31:26.870 --> 02:31:26.880 align:start position:0%
again it's been a portion by airport the
 
02:31:28.389 --> 02:31:28.399 align:start position:0%
amount that they're eligible for and
 
02:31:29.910 --> 02:31:29.920 align:start position:0%
once they provide those eligible
 
02:31:32.550 --> 02:31:32.560 align:start position:0%
expenditures those will be
 
02:31:34.550 --> 02:31:34.560 align:start position:0%
submitted submitted and reimbursed to
 
02:31:43.349 --> 02:31:43.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:47.590 --> 02:31:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:51.750 --> 02:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
is the arp funds and these were um also
 
02:31:53.190 --> 02:31:53.200 align:start position:0%
for operations maintenance and
 
02:31:53.200 --> 02:31:54.790 align:start position:0%
for operations maintenance and
concessions

02:31:54.790 --> 02:31:54.800 align:start position:0%
concessions
 
02:31:58.389 --> 02:31:58.399 align:start position:0%
so the arp funds are are newer um and
 
02:32:00.070 --> 02:32:00.080 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to do is draw down the
 
02:32:02.150 --> 02:32:02.160 align:start position:0%
funds from the cares act and chris first
 
02:32:04.230 --> 02:32:04.240 align:start position:0%
so you'll see you know not as much of
 
02:32:06.150 --> 02:32:06.160 align:start position:0%
this fun these funds have been
 
02:32:09.670 --> 02:32:09.680 align:start position:0%
expended to date um but um
 
02:32:12.630 --> 02:32:12.640 align:start position:0%
that that's the plan and so um we have
 
02:32:13.750 --> 02:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:32:16.389 --> 02:32:16.399 align:start position:0%
up through 2024 just to obligate the
 
02:32:19.429 --> 02:32:19.439 align:start position:0%
grants and then to spend it so um these
 
02:32:21.910 --> 02:32:21.920 align:start position:0%
airports um have additional allocations
 
02:32:24.469 --> 02:32:24.479 align:start position:0%
that they're eligible for
 
02:32:27.110 --> 02:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
as as they provide as they as we draw
 
02:32:28.870 --> 02:32:28.880 align:start position:0%
down the cares in chrisa then we'll move
 
02:32:30.710 --> 02:32:30.720 align:start position:0%
to these arp funds
 
02:32:37.590 --> 02:32:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:39.349 --> 02:32:39.359 align:start position:0%
okay can i just
 
02:32:40.870 --> 02:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
on the uh
 
02:32:42.950 --> 02:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
mount washington regional airport is
 
02:32:45.990 --> 02:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
that the one in freiburg or is that
 
02:32:47.910 --> 02:32:47.920 align:start position:0%
someplace else
 
02:32:50.830 --> 02:32:50.840 align:start position:0%
freiburg i believe this is whitefield
 
02:32:52.950 --> 02:32:52.960 align:start position:0%
whitefield oh okay
 
02:32:55.590 --> 02:32:55.600 align:start position:0%
so we didn't give any money to fryeburg
 
02:32:55.600 --> 02:32:56.630 align:start position:0%
so we didn't give any money to fryeburg
okay

02:32:56.630 --> 02:32:56.640 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:33:04.830 --> 02:33:04.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:04.840 --> 02:33:06.469 align:start position:0%
 
pardon

02:33:06.469 --> 02:33:06.479 align:start position:0%
pardon
 
02:33:08.550 --> 02:33:08.560 align:start position:0%
yeah i know
 
02:33:08.560 --> 02:33:09.429 align:start position:0%
yeah i know
yes

02:33:09.429 --> 02:33:09.439 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:33:09.439 --> 02:33:10.309 align:start position:0%
yes
okay

02:33:10.309 --> 02:33:10.319 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:33:13.270 --> 02:33:13.280 align:start position:0%
so i guess i need to uh talk to d.o.t
 
02:33:16.550 --> 02:33:16.560 align:start position:0%
and maine okay thank you
 
02:33:19.349 --> 02:33:19.359 align:start position:0%
and then um on the last page um again
 
02:33:22.469 --> 02:33:22.479 align:start position:0%
these are arp funds and these are for
 
02:33:25.110 --> 02:33:25.120 align:start position:0%
the 10 match again for the capital
 
02:33:25.120 --> 02:33:26.630 align:start position:0%
the 10 match again for the capital
grants

02:33:26.630 --> 02:33:26.640 align:start position:0%
grants
 
02:33:28.790 --> 02:33:28.800 align:start position:0%
so this would cover the local and the
 
02:33:31.510 --> 02:33:31.520 align:start position:0%
state share on these capital grants and
 
02:33:33.110 --> 02:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
you can see the the grants that have
 
02:33:35.910 --> 02:33:35.920 align:start position:0%
been identified to date
 
02:33:38.469 --> 02:33:38.479 align:start position:0%
and you know once the the work has been
 
02:33:40.070 --> 02:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
done then they would get reimbursed from
 
02:33:48.630 --> 02:33:48.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:48.640 --> 02:33:49.910 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:33:49.910 --> 02:33:49.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:33:49.920 --> 02:33:52.150 align:start position:0%
okay
so

02:33:52.150 --> 02:33:52.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:33:54.150 --> 02:33:54.160 align:start position:0%
what's going on with
 
02:33:54.160 --> 02:33:55.429 align:start position:0%
what's going on with
roads

02:33:55.429 --> 02:33:55.439 align:start position:0%
roads
 
02:33:55.439 --> 02:33:57.030 align:start position:0%
roads
bridges

02:33:57.030 --> 02:33:57.040 align:start position:0%
bridges
 
02:33:58.950 --> 02:33:58.960 align:start position:0%
you know aren't we supposed to get money
 
02:34:01.190 --> 02:34:01.200 align:start position:0%
for that
 
02:34:03.510 --> 02:34:03.520 align:start position:0%
the the the funds related to roads and
 
02:34:05.429 --> 02:34:05.439 align:start position:0%
bridges are not coveted relief funds
 
02:34:08.309 --> 02:34:08.319 align:start position:0%
those were part of the um
 
02:34:11.590 --> 02:34:11.600 align:start position:0%
the reauthorization of the
 
02:34:14.309 --> 02:34:14.319 align:start position:0%
so that's the iija that came out so
 
02:34:16.230 --> 02:34:16.240 align:start position:0%
those are not covid related funds those
 
02:34:17.670 --> 02:34:17.680 align:start position:0%
are it's the
 
02:34:19.830 --> 02:34:19.840 align:start position:0%
natural authorization of our
 
02:34:19.840 --> 02:34:21.429 align:start position:0%
natural authorization of our
transportation

02:34:21.429 --> 02:34:21.439 align:start position:0%
transportation
 
02:34:23.670 --> 02:34:23.680 align:start position:0%
um budget so before that it was a fast
 
02:34:26.469 --> 02:34:26.479 align:start position:0%
act it was a five years and then
 
02:34:28.550 --> 02:34:28.560 align:start position:0%
they've now implemented the iija which
 
02:34:30.870 --> 02:34:30.880 align:start position:0%
will be over the next five years
 
02:34:33.429 --> 02:34:33.439 align:start position:0%
okay and that's the one
 
02:34:36.550 --> 02:34:36.560 align:start position:0%
so they're no special funds
 
02:34:38.070 --> 02:34:38.080 align:start position:0%
for d.o.t
 
02:34:40.870 --> 02:34:40.880 align:start position:0%
no the the iija are
 
02:34:42.550 --> 02:34:42.560 align:start position:0%
part of that federal reauthorization
 
02:34:44.070 --> 02:34:44.080 align:start position:0%
it's part of the 10-year plan we've
 
02:34:45.270 --> 02:34:45.280 align:start position:0%
brought that forward through the
 
02:34:45.280 --> 02:34:46.550 align:start position:0%
brought that forward through the
legislature

02:34:46.550 --> 02:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
02:34:49.110 --> 02:34:49.120 align:start position:0%
and hb 2022 is now with the legislature
 
02:34:51.270 --> 02:34:51.280 align:start position:0%
so all of those funds are included in
 
02:34:53.670 --> 02:34:53.680 align:start position:0%
the 10-year plan and as we go through
 
02:34:55.270 --> 02:34:55.280 align:start position:0%
the budget will be included in the
 
02:34:57.590 --> 02:34:57.600 align:start position:0%
budget going forward okay
 
02:35:00.469 --> 02:35:00.479 align:start position:0%
are there any questions yes uh represent
 
02:35:00.479 --> 02:35:01.429 align:start position:0%
are there any questions yes uh represent
leishman

02:35:01.429 --> 02:35:01.439 align:start position:0%
leishman
 
02:35:04.150 --> 02:35:04.160 align:start position:0%
thanks senator chair just first uh
 
02:35:06.230 --> 02:35:06.240 align:start position:0%
good job was nice to see start dates
 
02:35:08.389 --> 02:35:08.399 align:start position:0%
completion days yes and
 
02:35:11.190 --> 02:35:11.200 align:start position:0%
very complete reports so that was nice
 
02:35:13.670 --> 02:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
um we're engineers sir so oh there you
 
02:35:13.680 --> 02:35:15.110 align:start position:0%
um we're engineers sir so oh there you
go

02:35:15.110 --> 02:35:15.120 align:start position:0%
go
 
02:35:17.510 --> 02:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
so maybe a non-engineer question if i
 
02:35:19.910 --> 02:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
could madam chair so i i have a friend
 
02:35:21.590 --> 02:35:21.600 align:start position:0%
in the asphalt business and he said
 
02:35:23.750 --> 02:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
asphalt is going up just as fast as
 
02:35:25.510 --> 02:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
diesel how is that
 
02:35:28.150 --> 02:35:28.160 align:start position:0%
asphalt increase impacting like your
 
02:35:29.990 --> 02:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
highway projects because don't you have
 
02:35:31.910 --> 02:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
like a claws in there that some of it's
 
02:35:33.110 --> 02:35:33.120 align:start position:0%
based on
 
02:35:35.270 --> 02:35:35.280 align:start position:0%
costs so are you still able to pave the
 
02:35:37.270 --> 02:35:37.280 align:start position:0%
amount of roads that you anticipated or
 
02:35:38.790 --> 02:35:38.800 align:start position:0%
is that going to impact
 
02:35:40.950 --> 02:35:40.960 align:start position:0%
the amount of road mileage paved well
 
02:35:42.309 --> 02:35:42.319 align:start position:0%
that's that's a great question sir and
 
02:35:43.990 --> 02:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
we're seeing that and what you refer to
 
02:35:46.790 --> 02:35:46.800 align:start position:0%
that's the contingency uh that's this in
 
02:35:49.830 --> 02:35:49.840 align:start position:0%
every contract we're seeing uh inflation
 
02:35:51.190 --> 02:35:51.200 align:start position:0%
is really
 
02:35:53.590 --> 02:35:53.600 align:start position:0%
um proceeding unevenly certain things
 
02:35:56.070 --> 02:35:56.080 align:start position:0%
like petroleum-based steel things like
 
02:35:58.070 --> 02:35:58.080 align:start position:0%
this we're seeing significant increases
 
02:36:00.150 --> 02:36:00.160 align:start position:0%
in that inflation rate and we're just
 
02:36:01.670 --> 02:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
starting to see
 
02:36:03.990 --> 02:36:04.000 align:start position:0%
the impact of that on bids and contracts
 
02:36:06.309 --> 02:36:06.319 align:start position:0%
the contracts that exist already are
 
02:36:09.349 --> 02:36:09.359 align:start position:0%
are set um and a lot of the larger
 
02:36:11.990 --> 02:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
uh contractors who who do our work you
 
02:36:13.110 --> 02:36:13.120 align:start position:0%
know have
 
02:36:15.349 --> 02:36:15.359 align:start position:0%
big yards with a lot of materials that
 
02:36:16.950 --> 02:36:16.960 align:start position:0%
they've already secured over the last
 
02:36:18.230 --> 02:36:18.240 align:start position:0%
couple years
 
02:36:22.150 --> 02:36:22.160 align:start position:0%
so it's going to be a very gradual
 
02:36:24.550 --> 02:36:24.560 align:start position:0%
appearance of that inflation
 
02:36:27.190 --> 02:36:27.200 align:start position:0%
as far as in project cost increases
 
02:36:29.349 --> 02:36:29.359 align:start position:0%
things like that that's paid attention
 
02:36:29.359 --> 02:36:30.309 align:start position:0%
things like that that's paid attention
to

02:36:30.309 --> 02:36:30.319 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:36:32.870 --> 02:36:32.880 align:start position:0%
at the microscopic level by our by our
 
02:36:35.190 --> 02:36:35.200 align:start position:0%
project management office
 
02:36:37.270 --> 02:36:37.280 align:start position:0%
and uh we're just starting to see it i
 
02:36:39.110 --> 02:36:39.120 align:start position:0%
guess it's it's often referred to as a
 
02:36:41.190 --> 02:36:41.200 align:start position:0%
snake you know you see it
 
02:36:43.349 --> 02:36:43.359 align:start position:0%
uh you know kind of coming through the
 
02:36:46.710 --> 02:36:46.720 align:start position:0%
system and and as these contractors are
 
02:36:48.469 --> 02:36:48.479 align:start position:0%
you know even the smaller contractors
 
02:36:50.070 --> 02:36:50.080 align:start position:0%
that don't have the luxury of large
 
02:36:51.590 --> 02:36:51.600 align:start position:0%
yards full of materials and are doing
 
02:36:53.429 --> 02:36:53.439 align:start position:0%
just in time procurement
 
02:36:54.950 --> 02:36:54.960 align:start position:0%
they're seeing those results right now
 
02:36:58.550 --> 02:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
so yeah inflation's a concern it sure is
 
02:36:58.560 --> 02:37:02.150 align:start position:0%
so yeah inflation's a concern it sure is
expenditure

02:37:02.150 --> 02:37:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:03.830 --> 02:37:03.840 align:start position:0%
so i think the bottom line there is
 
02:37:06.309 --> 02:37:06.319 align:start position:0%
we're keeping our fingers crossed hoping
 
02:37:09.910 --> 02:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:13.349 --> 02:37:13.359 align:start position:0%
from an engineering point of view
 
02:37:13.359 --> 02:37:14.389 align:start position:0%
from an engineering point of view
okay

02:37:14.389 --> 02:37:14.399 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:37:16.950 --> 02:37:16.960 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
02:37:19.750 --> 02:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
i sincerely thank you and i
 
02:37:22.389 --> 02:37:22.399 align:start position:0%
i appreciate all of the work that uh
 
02:37:24.309 --> 02:37:24.319 align:start position:0%
that you do so thank you thank you very
 
02:37:24.319 --> 02:37:25.830 align:start position:0%
that you do so thank you thank you very
much

02:37:25.830 --> 02:37:25.840 align:start position:0%
much
 
02:37:25.840 --> 02:37:26.870 align:start position:0%
much
okay

02:37:26.870 --> 02:37:26.880 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:37:30.630 --> 02:37:30.640 align:start position:0%
uh i just want to pass out the or give
 
02:37:31.750 --> 02:37:31.760 align:start position:0%
you the
 
02:37:35.270 --> 02:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
dates over the next uh
 
02:37:37.349 --> 02:37:37.359 align:start position:0%
