00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 align:start position:0%

minute to call it up we will start with
 
00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 align:start position:0%
that few housekeeping things first uh
 
00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 align:start position:0%
this is for the members of the committee
 
00:03:19.149 --> 00:03:19.159 align:start position:0%
um right now I'm working on setting up a
 
00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:20.879 align:start position:0%
meeting with the Chief Justice of the
 
00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court to discuss our bill issues

and keeping with my commitment to make
 
00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 align:start position:0%
sure this is a nonpartisan event I will
 
00:03:31.869 --> 00:03:31.879 align:start position:0%
be taking uh a member probably I'm going
 
00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 align:start position:0%
to ask representative gathri to attend
 
00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
or representative
 
00:03:38.429 --> 00:03:38.439 align:start position:0%
Muse um I'm also working on a meeting
 
00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 align:start position:0%
hopefully next week with the attorney
 
00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
general same thing applies I've asked
 
00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 align:start position:0%
the um that the um attorneys for the
 
00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239 align:start position:0%
county uh come and join us and I've also
 
00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 align:start position:0%
extending an invitation to the public
 
00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 align:start position:0%
defenders to come and talk to
 
00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 align:start position:0%
us um each of these things that I've
 
00:04:02.589 --> 00:04:02.599 align:start position:0%
mentioned are all part of this bail
 
00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 align:start position:0%
reform there's so many moving parts so
 
00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:08.799 align:start position:0%
we all have to keep in mind that any
 
00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 align:start position:0%
change we do however small to this
 
00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 align:start position:0%
affects four or five different parts of
 
00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 align:start position:0%
our criminal justice system and each one
 
00:04:19.189 --> 00:04:19.199 align:start position:0%
of those within their agencies are
 
00:04:21.749 --> 00:04:21.759 align:start position:0%
affected so it's very complex a lot of
 
00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 align:start position:0%
moving parts so we have to be very
 
00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 align:start position:0%
deliberative in what we do for
 
00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 align:start position:0%
example if we contemplate having judges
 
00:04:33.749 --> 00:04:33.759 align:start position:0%
hear cases on a weekend you think okay
 
00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 align:start position:0%
judge has to be able to come in or do a
 
00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 align:start position:0%
zoom hearing on the
 
00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 align:start position:0%
weekend well not just the judge it's
 
00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.320 align:start position:0%
also the
 
00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.000 align:start position:0%
clerks the clerks have to be able to
 
00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 align:start position:0%
take take notes of the of everything
 
00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:48.600 align:start position:0%
that's happening to enter into their
 
00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 align:start position:0%
systems the clerks are union to have
 
00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600 align:start position:0%
them work on a weekend it's going to
 
00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.320 align:start position:0%
cause impa bargaining to open up their
 
00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440 align:start position:0%
contract very complex stuff so that's
 
00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.320 align:start position:0%
why it's important that we disc discuss
 
00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:02.720 align:start position:0%
and invite as many people as we can so
 
00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 align:start position:0%
that we understand the long range
 
00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:06.680 align:start position:0%
implications of every little change we
 
00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 align:start position:0%
make so let's talk about
 
00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:28.469 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:28.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:31.309 --> 00:05:31.319 align:start position:0%
list is that the one from the
 
00:05:31.319 --> 00:05:34.629 align:start position:0%
list is that the one from the
sen

00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:34.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:40.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:43.000 align:start position:0%
much all right so I'm going to be
 
00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:46.360 align:start position:0%
working off uh
 
00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:49.360 align:start position:0%
s252 as proposed by the
 
00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:51.520 align:start position:0%
Senate and we're going to look at their
 
00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:53.800 align:start position:0%
list of crimes that they would like to
 
00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
be not bailable by a bail
 
00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:00.400 align:start position:0%
commissioner and the first on the list
 
00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:02.120 align:start position:0%
this person charged with
 
00:06:04.189 --> 00:06:04.199 align:start position:0%
homicide I don't think we really have to
 
00:06:05.469 --> 00:06:05.479 align:start position:0%
include that because it's already got
 
00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:08.120 align:start position:0%
its own statute and it's not bailable so
 
00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:09.840 align:start position:0%
we can probably just cross that one off
 
00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:12.919 align:start position:0%
anyone have any thoughts on
 
00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:14.909 align:start position:0%
anyone have any thoughts on
that

00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:14.919 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:17.080 align:start position:0%
anyone is there a disadvantage to
 
00:06:19.029 --> 00:06:19.039 align:start position:0%
putting it on there making it
 
00:06:22.469 --> 00:06:22.479 align:start position:0%
redundant um no there's not um other
 
00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:24.120 align:start position:0%
than the fact that it's it makes looked
 
00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:25.840 align:start position:0%
like we didn't know it was already there
 
00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:28.280 align:start position:0%
but um we can we can leave it for now
 
00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:29.560 align:start position:0%
and put a pin in it and talk about about
 
00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:31.720 align:start position:0%
it when we draft the final one if you
 
00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:33.950 align:start position:0%
it when we draft the final one if you
want

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:33.960 align:start position:0%
want
 
00:06:37.589 --> 00:06:37.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:41.240 align:start position:0%
that no he has2 SB
 
00:06:45.029 --> 00:06:45.039 align:start position:0%
252 uh the next one we talk about is um
 
00:06:48.909 --> 00:06:48.919 align:start position:0%
first degree assault under RSA 631 can
 
00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:50.560 align:start position:0%
you call that statute up so as we go
 
00:06:53.629 --> 00:06:53.639 align:start position:0%
along I can we can actually read
 
00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:56.120 align:start position:0%
it RSA
 
00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:58.390 align:start position:0%
it RSA
631

00:06:58.390 --> 00:06:58.400 align:start position:0%
631
 
00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:06.510 align:start position:0%
631
one

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:06.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:11.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:15.909 --> 00:07:15.919 align:start position:0%
y um RSA 6311 first degree assault a
 
00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:18.440 align:start position:0%
person is guilty of a class a felony if
 
00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:21.440 align:start position:0%
he or she I will go ahead and add that
 
00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:23.400 align:start position:0%
purposely cause a serious bodily injury
 
00:07:25.309 --> 00:07:25.319 align:start position:0%
to another or purposely or knowingly
 
00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:27.240 align:start position:0%
causes bodily injury to another by means
 
00:07:28.309 --> 00:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
of a deadly
 
00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
weapon except that if that deadly weapon
 
00:07:32.629 --> 00:07:32.639 align:start position:0%
is a firearm he shall be sentenced in
 
00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:38.280 align:start position:0%
6512 purposely or knowingly causes
 
00:07:39.629 --> 00:07:39.639 align:start position:0%
injury to another resulting in a
 
00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:41.360 align:start position:0%
miscarriage or a still birth or
 
00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:43.120 align:start position:0%
knowingly or recklessly causes serious
 
00:07:45.029 --> 00:07:45.039 align:start position:0%
bodily injury to a person under 13 years
 
00:07:47.469 --> 00:07:47.479 align:start position:0%
of age in this section and then it goes
 
00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
birth thank you so the question for us
 
00:07:59.550 --> 00:07:59.560 align:start position:0%
is does does that crime in and of itself
 
00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:03.080 align:start position:0%
um characterize or or um lead one to
 
00:08:04.589 --> 00:08:04.599 align:start position:0%
believe that that person were they
 
00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:07.360 align:start position:0%
released would be a danger to the public
 
00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:10.800 align:start position:0%
um I I I I tend to agree that that's a
 
00:08:13.149 --> 00:08:13.159 align:start position:0%
very serious and violent crime and it
 
00:08:15.469 --> 00:08:15.479 align:start position:0%
should be heard by a judge and not
 
00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:18.240 align:start position:0%
released by a bail commissioner um what
 
00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
are the committee's
 
00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:22.120 align:start position:0%
thoughts uh representative
 
00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:25.080 align:start position:0%
Muse yes as we go through this it would
 
00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:27.080 align:start position:0%
be very helpful uh if when we're looking
 
00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:29.720 align:start position:0%
at the statute we could just uh ALS Alo
 
00:08:33.029 --> 00:08:33.039 align:start position:0%
mention uh what the the penalty is so
 
00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
for this one it's obviously a felony uh
 
00:08:38.149 --> 00:08:38.159 align:start position:0%
some of the others it's not so obvious
 
00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:39.640 align:start position:0%
uh so it would just be helpful if we
 
00:08:41.269 --> 00:08:41.279 align:start position:0%
just mentioned that going
 
00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:43.680 align:start position:0%
forward agreed we will make sure we call
 
00:08:45.829 --> 00:08:45.839 align:start position:0%
out whether it's a felony or not or if a
 
00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:48.120 align:start position:0%
certain degree of it is a felony because
 
00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:50.040 align:start position:0%
some of them for example stalking have a
 
00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor level and a felony level so
 
00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:55.480 align:start position:0%
we we'll call that out um as we go um
 
00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:57.160 align:start position:0%
with regard to this one so anyone else
 
00:08:59.670 --> 00:08:59.680 align:start position:0%
representative Stone Mr Mr chairman I
 
00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:08.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:11.200 align:start position:0%
it everyone seems in agreement that
 
00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:13.640 align:start position:0%
one's pretty clearcut uh the next one is
 
00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:17.160 align:start position:0%
uh RSA excuse me second degree assault
 
00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:28.110 align:start position:0%
uh RSA excuse me second degree assault
RSA

00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:28.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:47.110 align:start position:0%
 
6312

00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:50.000 align:start position:0%
okay 6312 second degree assault a person
 
00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:52.320 align:start position:0%

00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:26.440 align:start position:0%
miscarriage or stillbirth or purposely
 
00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:29.320 align:start position:0%
or knowingly engages in the strength
 
00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
ation of another in this section and
 
00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:33.160 align:start position:0%
then it goes on to describe miscarriage
 
00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:35.000 align:start position:0%
sto birth and
 
00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:37.480 align:start position:0%
strangulation um Mr chairman it does go
 
00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:38.920 align:start position:0%
on to say upon proof that the victim and
 
00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:40.360 align:start position:0%
defendant were intimate Partners or
 
00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:41.720 align:start position:0%
family of household members or those
 
00:10:44.509 --> 00:10:44.519 align:start position:0%
terms are defined in RSA
 
00:10:47.509 --> 00:10:47.519 align:start position:0%
632b um shall be recorded as second
 
00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:50.120 align:start position:0%
deegree assault under the domestic
 
00:10:52.829 --> 00:10:52.839 align:start position:0%
violence thank you so that it seems to
 
00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:55.320 align:start position:0%
me the the element um that's different
 
00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
in this one is it's
 
00:10:59.670 --> 00:10:59.680 align:start position:0%
Reckless versus um
 
00:11:02.509 --> 00:11:02.519 align:start position:0%
intentional can you read that part again
 
00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
indifference yeah hold on one second let
 
00:11:23.389 --> 00:11:23.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:27.949 --> 00:11:27.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:32.920 align:start position:0%
hold wait I can't find it now
 
00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
oh okay it's under C recklessly causes
 
00:11:37.629 --> 00:11:37.639 align:start position:0%
bodily injury to another under
 
00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:39.880 align:start position:0%
circumstances manifesting extreme
 
00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:47.629 --> 00:11:47.639 align:start position:0%
life thank you any uh thoughts on this
 
00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:50.480 align:start position:0%
one um so this this also seems very
 
00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
serious um versus apparently versus um
 
00:11:56.670 --> 00:11:56.680 align:start position:0%
planning it out or intentionally someone
 
00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:01.120 align:start position:0%
did something so reckless that that um
 
00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:03.480 align:start position:0%
that a normal person would would never
 
00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:05.800 align:start position:0%
um contemplate doing something like that
 
00:12:07.949 --> 00:12:07.959 align:start position:0%
and in doing such an act they caused
 
00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:10.760 align:start position:0%
serious bodily injury to another person
 
00:12:13.629 --> 00:12:13.639 align:start position:0%
again um someone who was so reckless
 
00:12:15.389 --> 00:12:15.399 align:start position:0%
that they caused such serious bodily
 
00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:17.560 align:start position:0%
injury in my mind raises serious
 
00:12:21.069 --> 00:12:21.079 align:start position:0%
questions about their um ability to um
 
00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:22.760 align:start position:0%
maintain themselves in good order and
 
00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:24.440 align:start position:0%
not be a danger to the public due to
 
00:12:27.189 --> 00:12:27.199 align:start position:0%
their recklessness in in whatever the
 
00:12:29.829 --> 00:12:29.839 align:start position:0%
case is it's a felon
 
00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:33.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:36.440 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
00:12:39.389 --> 00:12:39.399 align:start position:0%
Muse one of the things as we as we go
 
00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:41.440 align:start position:0%
through this list I think pretty much
 
00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:43.360 align:start position:0%
looking at this list I mean I think we
 
00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:45.120 align:start position:0%
would probably come to the conclusion
 
00:12:47.389 --> 00:12:47.399 align:start position:0%
that all of these are are pretty pretty
 
00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:51.320 align:start position:0%
serious offenses I think the question is
 
00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:55.120 align:start position:0%
um um what do we do with this list you
 
00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:56.560 align:start position:0%
know and kind of Where Do We Go From
 
00:12:59.629 --> 00:12:59.639 align:start position:0%
Here uh and and so
 
00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:01.800 align:start position:0%
if you look at it if you know I mean if
 
00:13:04.189 --> 00:13:04.199 align:start position:0%
you if you look at it one way you know
 
00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:06.800 align:start position:0%
at the end of this process we might have
 
00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:08.680 align:start position:0%
the same list of very serious crimes
 
00:13:11.269 --> 00:13:11.279 align:start position:0%
that we had when we when we started if
 
00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:14.680 align:start position:0%
we look at it from from a from a
 
00:13:17.269 --> 00:13:17.279 align:start position:0%
different perspective so so for for
 
00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:20.920 align:start position:0%
example if um the maximum time a person
 
00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:23.880 align:start position:0%
could be held without uh a hearing
 
00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:26.760 align:start position:0%
before a judge was significantly
 
00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:32.240 align:start position:0%
significantly reduced then uh it becomes
 
00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:35.440 align:start position:0%
a lot easier to have uh a more
 
00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
comprehensive list um but if if there's
 
00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:42.360 align:start position:0%
no movement on something like that then
 
00:13:46.389 --> 00:13:46.399 align:start position:0%
you really would want to make a an
 
00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:50.120 align:start position:0%
effort to filter this down to a list of
 
00:13:52.509 --> 00:13:52.519 align:start position:0%
the the most serious of the serious
 
00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:55.720 align:start position:0%
crimes I tend to agree and I think we're
 
00:13:57.910 --> 00:13:57.920 align:start position:0%
we're probably thinking along the same
 
00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:00.040 align:start position:0%
um same
 
00:14:03.829 --> 00:14:03.839 align:start position:0%
track um I I I look at the whole list
 
00:14:06.389 --> 00:14:06.399 align:start position:0%
and I see you know these are all very
 
00:14:06.399 --> 00:14:07.870 align:start position:0%
and I see you know these are all very
serious

00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:07.880 align:start position:0%
serious
 
00:14:11.189 --> 00:14:11.199 align:start position:0%
crimes that um speak for themselves
 
00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:12.680 align:start position:0%
about someone being dangerous if they
 
00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:15.560 align:start position:0%
would do one of them however I I also
 
00:14:17.949 --> 00:14:17.959 align:start position:0%
agree that they are innocent to proven
 
00:14:19.949 --> 00:14:19.959 align:start position:0%
guilty so we have to make sure that if
 
00:14:22.629 --> 00:14:22.639 align:start position:0%
they are held it's for a limited period
 
00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:26.800 align:start position:0%
of time with that in mind um I had
 
00:14:28.189 --> 00:14:28.199 align:start position:0%
contemplated discussing with the
 
00:14:28.199 --> 00:14:29.189 align:start position:0%
contemplated discussing with the
committee

00:14:29.189 --> 00:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:31.680 align:start position:0%
setting a um a requirement on the courts
 
00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
to hold a a hearing on a weekend be it
 
00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:38.160 align:start position:0%
via Zoom electronically however so that
 
00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:40.680 align:start position:0%
someone's not held more than 24 hours
 
00:14:43.749 --> 00:14:43.759 align:start position:0%
without having access to a judge to at
 
00:14:46.629 --> 00:14:46.639 align:start position:0%
least listen to their their case um I
 
00:14:49.509 --> 00:14:49.519 align:start position:0%
know our sister state to the South
 
00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts they have something
 
00:14:52.509 --> 00:14:52.519 align:start position:0%
similar called the Jenkins rule if
 
00:14:54.350 --> 00:14:54.360 align:start position:0%
someone's going to be held one in 24
 
00:14:56.910 --> 00:14:56.920 align:start position:0%
hours they have to run it by a judge on
 
00:14:59.910 --> 00:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
the weekend to phone callers Zoom call
 
00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:02.240 align:start position:0%
that way the defendant has at least had
 
00:15:04.389 --> 00:15:04.399 align:start position:0%
a set of eyes on it besides the
 
00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:06.720 align:start position:0%
commissioner um and then he just makes a
 
00:15:08.350 --> 00:15:08.360 align:start position:0%
quick decision yeah hold him and then
 
00:15:09.749 --> 00:15:09.759 align:start position:0%
they arraign him and deal with it on
 
00:15:12.189 --> 00:15:12.199 align:start position:0%
Monday or he says n you know that's kind
 
00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
of weak let him go so at least I feel
 
00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
like I agree with you that if we're
 
00:15:17.829 --> 00:15:17.839 align:start position:0%
going to keep a comprehensive list then
 
00:15:19.189 --> 00:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
we need to make sure that people have
 
00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:20.880 align:start position:0%
access to someone besides just in the
 
00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:23.920 align:start position:0%
police station any further thoughts
 
00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:25.560 align:start position:0%
representative Pratt I agree with the
 
00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:29.560 align:start position:0%
chairman uh salt should be on the list
 
00:15:32.829 --> 00:15:32.839 align:start position:0%
any other thoughts that's it I know that
 
00:15:34.309 --> 00:15:34.319 align:start position:0%
we have a representative here from the
 
00:15:36.069 --> 00:15:36.079 align:start position:0%
police today would you like to give
 
00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:56.800 align:start position:0%
this uh Dan Conley from the gtown police
 
00:15:58.829 --> 00:15:58.839 align:start position:0%
department uh specifically you just
 
00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:01.720 align:start position:0%
asking about the second degree assault
 
00:16:04.269 --> 00:16:04.279 align:start position:0%
or or the whole if if you would mind
 
00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
just I'm sure you've had a chance to
 
00:16:07.749 --> 00:16:07.759 align:start position:0%
look at the list of crimes what are your
 
00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
thoughts on on the on the crimes we have
 
00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:11.880 align:start position:0%
listed is it comprehensive enough or do
 
00:16:13.309 --> 00:16:13.319 align:start position:0%
you feel like some of them may be not
 
00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:15.920 align:start position:0%
necessary I believe they're all um
 
00:16:18.949 --> 00:16:18.959 align:start position:0%
necessary to be in there they're if you
 
00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
look at the crimes there they all are
 
00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:22.920 align:start position:0%
either violent
 
00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:25.560 align:start position:0%
felonies um the the two that aren't
 
00:16:29.069 --> 00:16:29.079 align:start position:0%
felonies it's it's domestic violence and
 
00:16:29.079 --> 00:16:30.189 align:start position:0%
felonies it's it's domestic violence and
um

00:16:30.189 --> 00:16:30.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:33.269 --> 00:16:33.279 align:start position:0%
stalking and those are two very serious
 
00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:35.920 align:start position:0%
crimes with a you know high percentage
 
00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:40.920 align:start position:0%
for lethality just due to the um danger
 
00:16:43.509 --> 00:16:43.519 align:start position:0%
that these crimes pose to the victims of
 
00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
those crimes of domestic violence and
 
00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:49.120 align:start position:0%
stalking and stalking if it is it can be
 
00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:49.829 align:start position:0%
stalking and stalking if it is it can be
a

00:16:49.829 --> 00:16:49.839 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:52.680 align:start position:0%
felony the misdemeanor the majority of
 
00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:55.560 align:start position:0%
ones um that you see prosecuted as a
 
00:16:59.269 --> 00:16:59.279 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor it's usually for
 
00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
violating a no contact order within a
 
00:17:06.590 --> 00:17:06.600 align:start position:0%
previous bail um so if you look at a
 
00:17:08.669 --> 00:17:08.679 align:start position:0%
stalking a majority of the charges for
 
00:17:11.669 --> 00:17:11.679 align:start position:0%
violating that no contact provision from
 
00:17:14.949 --> 00:17:14.959 align:start position:0%
uh bail under 597
 
00:17:17.789 --> 00:17:17.799 align:start position:0%
so they're already out on bail and then
 
00:17:18.909 --> 00:17:18.919 align:start position:0%
they're being charged with stalking
 
00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:20.760 align:start position:0%
because they're contacting the victim
 
00:17:23.949 --> 00:17:23.959 align:start position:0%
that they're usually under for um
 
00:17:25.549 --> 00:17:25.559 align:start position:0%
domestic violence and that's just the
 
00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:27.400 align:start position:0%
district court part of
 
00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:29.470 align:start position:0%
district court part of
it

00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:29.480 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:31.520 align:start position:0%
and and the other ones you know the of
 
00:17:33.669 --> 00:17:33.679 align:start position:0%
course the sexual assaults and the uh
 
00:17:36.190 --> 00:17:36.200 align:start position:0%
kidnapping and trafficking they're just
 
00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
um we we believe uh from the Chiefs
 
00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:41.440 align:start position:0%
Association and just my personal thing I
 
00:17:43.669 --> 00:17:43.679 align:start position:0%
believe they all are pose a huge danger
 
00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:45.960 align:start position:0%
to victim in the
 
00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:49.520 align:start position:0%
public thank you um can have can you
 
00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
tell us what if any experience you've
 
00:17:53.950 --> 00:17:53.960 align:start position:0%
had working with the bail Commissioners
 
00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:55.480 align:start position:0%
on these crimes have you seen people
 
00:17:57.390 --> 00:17:57.400 align:start position:0%
being let go on
 
00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:01.360 align:start position:0%
these just from the I I'll I'll speak
 
00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:05.440 align:start position:0%
just on the domestic violence and
 
00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
stalking as misdemeanor yes um majority
 
00:18:12.270 --> 00:18:12.280 align:start position:0%
of times more likely than not they're
 
00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:14.960 align:start position:0%
getting the pr bail under domestic
 
00:18:16.190 --> 00:18:16.200 align:start position:0%
violence if you are charged with
 
00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:17.840 align:start position:0%
domestic violence they will get a
 
00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:22.880 align:start position:0%
quicker arraignment date than a um you
 
00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:26.320 align:start position:0%
know say a regular ndv simple assault
 
00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:27.960 align:start position:0%
they'll be arraigned within you know
 
00:18:31.990 --> 00:18:32.000 align:start position:0%
within Pro usually the next um available
 
00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:34.280 align:start position:0%
Court dat but in some some courts that
 
00:18:35.789 --> 00:18:35.799 align:start position:0%
could be a week or two just because
 
00:18:36.789 --> 00:18:36.799 align:start position:0%
there's no
 
00:18:40.149 --> 00:18:40.159 align:start position:0%
judge um you don't often
 
00:18:40.159 --> 00:18:41.789 align:start position:0%
judge um you don't often
see

00:18:41.789 --> 00:18:41.799 align:start position:0%
see
 
00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:44.600 align:start position:0%
um it's very rare to see someone held on
 
00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:47.080 align:start position:0%
a misdemeanor domestic violence or
 
00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:48.390 align:start position:0%
a misdemeanor domestic violence or
misdemeanor

00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:48.400 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor
 
00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:51.360 align:start position:0%
stalking and when stalking is
 
00:18:54.029 --> 00:18:54.039 align:start position:0%
charged for violating a no contact
 
00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
provision within a
 
00:18:58.310 --> 00:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
bail um it's very similar to VI
 
00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:00.120 align:start position:0%
violation of protection order in
 
00:19:02.149 --> 00:19:02.159 align:start position:0%
violation protection order there's no
 
00:19:06.190 --> 00:19:06.200 align:start position:0%
bail but for stalking they get bail so
 
00:19:10.669 --> 00:19:10.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:12.880 align:start position:0%
PR thank you does anyone have any
 
00:19:14.669 --> 00:19:14.679 align:start position:0%
questions for the
 
00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:17.480 align:start position:0%
captain representative
 
00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:20.280 align:start position:0%
Stone thank you Mr chairman in your
 
00:19:22.789 --> 00:19:22.799 align:start position:0%
experience uh when someone's released on
 
00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:25.280 align:start position:0%
PR bail for domestic misdemeanor say
 
00:19:26.990 --> 00:19:27.000 align:start position:0%
simple assault how often do you see them
 
00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:29.360 align:start position:0%
violating the bail on those cases in
 
00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:30.830 align:start position:0%
violating the bail on those cases in
your

00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:30.840 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:19:33.909 --> 00:19:33.919 align:start position:0%
experience I I I don't have a a number
 
00:19:37.029 --> 00:19:37.039 align:start position:0%
for you or a percentage but it
 
00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
it's it's
 
00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:40.830 align:start position:0%
it's it's
common

00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:40.840 align:start position:0%
common
 
00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:43.840 align:start position:0%
because they have a
 
00:19:46.149 --> 00:19:46.159 align:start position:0%
relationship and and and more often than
 
00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:49.360 align:start position:0%
not they try to contact them somehow um
 
00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:50.720 align:start position:0%
so it's
 
00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:53.240 align:start position:0%
not I I wouldn't say it's every single
 
00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
one I wouldn't say it's every other one
 
00:19:57.029 --> 00:19:57.039 align:start position:0%
but it's it's it's more common than not
 
00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:05.669 --> 00:20:05.679 align:start position:0%
teely thank you is it is it true that um
 
00:20:08.669 --> 00:20:08.679 align:start position:0%
the most dangerous time for a victim of
 
00:20:10.149 --> 00:20:10.159 align:start position:0%
domestic violence is when they try to
 
00:20:12.789 --> 00:20:12.799 align:start position:0%
leave their abuser and which usually
 
00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:14.720 align:start position:0%
starts with the first arrest like
 
00:20:17.830 --> 00:20:17.840 align:start position:0%
this yes and domestic violence charges
 
00:20:19.789 --> 00:20:19.799 align:start position:0%
just they pose a huge danger to the
 
00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:23.360 align:start position:0%
victim because um speaking from my
 
00:20:25.630 --> 00:20:25.640 align:start position:0%
experience and working with victims when
 
00:20:27.149 --> 00:20:27.159 align:start position:0%
the police are finally at the house
 
00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:29.120 align:start position:0%
making an arrest it's not the first time
 
00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:32.080 align:start position:0%
that that victim has experienced um
 
00:20:34.510 --> 00:20:34.520 align:start position:0%
violence from their partner by the time
 
00:20:36.190 --> 00:20:36.200 align:start position:0%
we get there it's it's been it's usually
 
00:20:38.110 --> 00:20:38.120 align:start position:0%
an ongoing thing and the victim finally
 
00:20:42.190 --> 00:20:42.200 align:start position:0%
had enough to call
 
00:20:45.190 --> 00:20:45.200 align:start position:0%
and I I I'm not a domestic violence
 
00:20:47.549 --> 00:20:47.559 align:start position:0%
expert I'm not you know I don't work for
 
00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
um one of the organizations that deal
 
00:20:50.789 --> 00:20:50.799 align:start position:0%
specifically with victims that's just
 
00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:53.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:56.080 align:start position:0%
experience thank you um is there
 
00:20:57.390 --> 00:20:57.400 align:start position:0%
anything you'd like to oh excuse me go
 
00:20:59.549 --> 00:20:59.559 align:start position:0%
ahead thank you Mr
 
00:21:02.149 --> 00:21:02.159 align:start position:0%
chairman you had mentioned when you go
 
00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
when you go to a home you know it's not
 
00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:05.480 align:start position:0%
the first time that that this has
 
00:21:07.669 --> 00:21:07.679 align:start position:0%
happened it just escalated to this point
 
00:21:10.789 --> 00:21:10.799 align:start position:0%
how many times do you have to go to a
 
00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
home when a concerned neighbor or
 
00:21:15.870 --> 00:21:15.880 align:start position:0%
somebody you know just happens to be
 
00:21:18.909 --> 00:21:18.919 align:start position:0%
maybe going past that house and can hear
 
00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:20.720 align:start position:0%
obviously something is not right when
 
00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:22.840 align:start position:0%
the victim themselves is not able to
 
00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:25.480 align:start position:0%
call that that happens a lot uh
 
00:21:27.029 --> 00:21:27.039 align:start position:0%
especially in you know we have a you
 
00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:29.240 align:start position:0%
know come uh apartment complexes the
 
00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
neighbor will call um because they can
 
00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:33.400 align:start position:0%
hear the damage being done in the house
 
00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:35.440 align:start position:0%
or they see something or hear something
 
00:21:40.269 --> 00:21:40.279 align:start position:0%
that that happens often times and um you
 
00:21:42.430 --> 00:21:42.440 align:start position:0%
know that is the victims you often when
 
00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:44.480 align:start position:0%
we show up they're very nervous because
 
00:21:46.029 --> 00:21:46.039 align:start position:0%
someone else called and they you know
 
00:21:47.269 --> 00:21:47.279 align:start position:0%
they're they're nervous of what's going
 
00:21:53.029 --> 00:21:53.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:55.640 align:start position:0%
leave represent
 
00:21:59.190 --> 00:21:59.200 align:start position:0%
Muse yeah to
 
00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:04.320 align:start position:0%
to what ex to what extent um you know
 
00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:06.320 align:start position:0%
when you take a look at at sort of like
 
00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:09.200 align:start position:0%
the kind of like all all of these cases
 
00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:11.240 align:start position:0%
you kind of you kind of put them all
 
00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:13.950 align:start position:0%
you kind of you kind of put them all
together

00:22:13.950 --> 00:22:13.960 align:start position:0%
together
 
00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:17.720 align:start position:0%
um one of the things that I'm um trying
 
00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
to work through in in in my own head are
 
00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:24.880 align:start position:0%
the the percentage of of people who or
 
00:22:30.149 --> 00:22:30.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
um let's say released uh after a
 
00:22:36.110 --> 00:22:36.120 align:start position:0%
domestic violence charge so maybe a
 
00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
firsttime or some something like that
 
00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
and and who go back and and who are are
 
00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
almost immediately in contact uh with
 
00:22:48.269 --> 00:22:48.279 align:start position:0%
their spouse again or with whoever they
 
00:22:50.029 --> 00:22:50.039 align:start position:0%
committed the act of domestic violence
 
00:22:53.669 --> 00:22:53.679 align:start position:0%
again so I guess my question is is how
 
00:22:56.230 --> 00:22:56.240 align:start position:0%
common is it for somebody who's been
 
00:22:59.029 --> 00:22:59.039 align:start position:0%
charged to just go right back to the
 
00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:01.440 align:start position:0%
well and do it all over again very
 
00:23:04.190 --> 00:23:04.200 align:start position:0%
common very and a lot of times the
 
00:23:08.750 --> 00:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
victims will not notify us that either
 
00:23:10.510 --> 00:23:10.520 align:start position:0%
the defendant has come
 
00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:14.240 align:start position:0%
home to where they are or um is
 
00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
contacting them in some sort of way the
 
00:23:22.510 --> 00:23:22.520 align:start position:0%
majority of time um we end up you know
 
00:23:24.909 --> 00:23:24.919 align:start position:0%
arresting them for violating the bail
 
00:23:26.789 --> 00:23:26.799 align:start position:0%
order or charging them with stalking as
 
00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:28.480 align:start position:0%
usually we see them
 
00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:30.400 align:start position:0%
with them or we see them at the house or
 
00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:32.200 align:start position:0%
we get called there again for another
 
00:23:34.909 --> 00:23:34.919 align:start position:0%
crime and he's there or she's there and
 
00:23:36.990 --> 00:23:37.000 align:start position:0%
they bail against being at that person's
 
00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
house or within contact with them you
 
00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:42.480 align:start position:0%
what when they get on we see it a lot of
 
00:23:44.789 --> 00:23:44.799 align:start position:0%
times is when you start going for
 
00:23:47.110 --> 00:23:47.120 align:start position:0%
domestic cause you you end up going to
 
00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:48.600 align:start position:0%
that same
 
00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:51.440 align:start position:0%
address repeatedly because they're in a
 
00:23:54.909 --> 00:23:54.919 align:start position:0%
cycle of violence and you're just going
 
00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
Time After Time After Time and it's the
 
00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:58.470 align:start position:0%
Time After Time After Time and it's the
same

00:23:58.470 --> 00:23:58.480 align:start position:0%
same
 
00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:00.720 align:start position:0%
people it's the same victims it's the
 
00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:02.269 align:start position:0%
people it's the same victims it's the
same

00:24:02.269 --> 00:24:02.279 align:start position:0%
same
 
00:24:06.029 --> 00:24:06.039 align:start position:0%
defendant thank you Cam do you for the
 
00:24:07.269 --> 00:24:07.279 align:start position:0%
benefit of the members of the committee
 
00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
who don't have a lot of criminal law
 
00:24:11.230 --> 00:24:11.240 align:start position:0%
experience could you tell us about the
 
00:24:15.070 --> 00:24:15.080 align:start position:0%
power of of of the police to charge um
 
00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:18.640 align:start position:0%
even if the victim doesn't want a a case
 
00:24:22.149 --> 00:24:22.159 align:start position:0%
brought yeah we we can
 
00:24:26.190 --> 00:24:26.200 align:start position:0%
um based on what the officers observe if
 
00:24:28.990 --> 00:24:29.000 align:start position:0%
they observe injuries um you know they
 
00:24:30.750 --> 00:24:30.760 align:start position:0%
observe a you know a red mark on the
 
00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
face even if the victim is not going to
 
00:24:34.950 --> 00:24:34.960 align:start position:0%
you know the the police officers can
 
00:24:37.990 --> 00:24:38.000 align:start position:0%
kind of put some some evidence together
 
00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:40.760 align:start position:0%
you know but you can still go forward
 
00:24:42.909 --> 00:24:42.919 align:start position:0%
with a charge where the victim is uh
 
00:24:45.669 --> 00:24:45.679 align:start position:0%
unwilling to you know testify against
 
00:24:50.070 --> 00:24:50.080 align:start position:0%
that defendant due to um you know mostly
 
00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:52.880 align:start position:0%
what the officer observes when he gets
 
00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:54.840 align:start position:0%
he or she gets to that scene you know if
 
00:24:56.470 --> 00:24:56.480 align:start position:0%
there's there is an injury if there's
 
00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:00.840 align:start position:0%
marks um you can still make a charge go
 
00:25:04.830 --> 00:25:04.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:08.590 --> 00:25:08.600 align:start position:0%
cooperation thank you
 
00:25:11.389 --> 00:25:11.399 align:start position:0%
um since I have you here I'm going to um
 
00:25:12.990 --> 00:25:13.000 align:start position:0%
ask you a few other questions regarding
 
00:25:16.669 --> 00:25:16.679 align:start position:0%
the bail in general um with regard to
 
00:25:19.230 --> 00:25:19.240 align:start position:0%
what we're discussing though right now
 
00:25:23.029 --> 00:25:23.039 align:start position:0%
the um so bail Commissioners will let
 
00:25:28.950 --> 00:25:28.960 align:start position:0%
people go on PR in your experience um
 
00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:30.840 align:start position:0%
but that is also in keeping with the way
 
00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:33.360 align:start position:0%
the current statute's written is it not
 
00:25:36.669 --> 00:25:36.679 align:start position:0%
ye yes we rarely see a cash bail unless
 
00:25:40.630 --> 00:25:40.640 align:start position:0%
it's um by Statute for violation of uh
 
00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:45.360 align:start position:0%
protection order excuse me or
 
00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:49.080 align:start position:0%
um you you know it's such a it's very
 
00:25:51.909 --> 00:25:51.919 align:start position:0%
very rare to see a cash bail um very
 
00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
rare even on these felonies even on
 
00:25:55.310 --> 00:25:55.320 align:start position:0%
these violent felonies first degree
 
00:25:58.710 --> 00:25:58.720 align:start position:0%
assault second degree assault um
 
00:26:01.389 --> 00:26:01.399 align:start position:0%
barring some you know exceptional
 
00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
situation they're going to get PR
 
00:26:07.230 --> 00:26:07.240 align:start position:0%
bail and just so the committee
 
00:26:09.549 --> 00:26:09.559 align:start position:0%
understands it's it's not the bail
 
00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:11.120 align:start position:0%
commissioner's fault I mean this is the
 
00:26:12.909 --> 00:26:12.919 align:start position:0%
stat this is why we have to change the
 
00:26:16.750 --> 00:26:16.760 align:start position:0%
statute right I I agree and you know
 
00:26:19.870 --> 00:26:19.880 align:start position:0%
I I would I would actually like to you
 
00:26:22.029 --> 00:26:22.039 align:start position:0%
know felony Reckless conduct we see
 
00:26:24.310 --> 00:26:24.320 align:start position:0%
oftentimes with involving
 
00:26:27.870 --> 00:26:27.880 align:start position:0%
Firearms um and and they're not getting
 
00:26:30.510 --> 00:26:30.520 align:start position:0%
cash bill could you describe that what
 
00:26:31.950 --> 00:26:31.960 align:start position:0%
what that would look like a felony
 
00:26:34.549 --> 00:26:34.559 align:start position:0%
Reckless conduct um someone fires a
 
00:26:38.149 --> 00:26:38.159 align:start position:0%
firearm um at a house doesn't hit anyone
 
00:26:40.549 --> 00:26:40.559 align:start position:0%
you know but it's they fired it
 
00:26:42.789 --> 00:26:42.799 align:start position:0%
recklessly and it went through someone's
 
00:26:44.389 --> 00:26:44.399 align:start position:0%
uh it could go through your neighbor's
 
00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:47.480 align:start position:0%
you know door um you know we just had
 
00:26:50.990 --> 00:26:51.000 align:start position:0%
one in gtown end of August that you know
 
00:26:54.590 --> 00:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
we had uh we still still in AC of
 
00:26:57.230 --> 00:26:57.240 align:start position:0%
Investigation but a house was shot shot
 
00:26:57.240 --> 00:26:58.430 align:start position:0%
Investigation but a house was shot shot
at

00:26:58.430 --> 00:26:58.440 align:start position:0%
at
 
00:27:01.269 --> 00:27:01.279 align:start position:0%
um you're not talking about though
 
00:27:03.269 --> 00:27:03.279 align:start position:0%
someone recklessly target shooting
 
00:27:05.710 --> 00:27:05.720 align:start position:0%
you're talking about like a driveby or
 
00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:07.600 align:start position:0%
just someone you being an idiot driving
 
00:27:11.909 --> 00:27:11.919 align:start position:0%
around Sho yes yep okay yeah no and
 
00:27:15.669 --> 00:27:15.679 align:start position:0%
um just firing it happens and it happens
 
00:27:18.389 --> 00:27:18.399 align:start position:0%
happens in Manchester all the time um
 
00:27:20.269 --> 00:27:20.279 align:start position:0%
and and absence some like I said some
 
00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:22.360 align:start position:0%
exceptional circumstances they're not
 
00:27:24.590 --> 00:27:24.600 align:start position:0%
going to be held on cash
 
00:27:27.669 --> 00:27:27.679 align:start position:0%
bail I think anyone who lives in the
 
00:27:30.990 --> 00:27:31.000 align:start position:0%
sure can take a look at um any number of
 
00:27:34.350 --> 00:27:34.360 align:start position:0%
street signs and see the holes and we
 
00:27:35.710 --> 00:27:35.720 align:start position:0%
know that there's a little bit of recous
 
00:27:37.470 --> 00:27:37.480 align:start position:0%
shooting going on so the committee will
 
00:27:39.669 --> 00:27:39.679 align:start position:0%
take that um that that crime under
 
00:27:39.679 --> 00:27:41.230 align:start position:0%
take that um that that crime under
advisement

00:27:41.230 --> 00:27:41.240 align:start position:0%
advisement
 
00:27:46.029 --> 00:27:46.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:50.470 --> 00:27:50.480 align:start position:0%
um do you see the value in making having
 
00:27:52.549 --> 00:27:52.559 align:start position:0%
a judge have to take a second look at
 
00:27:54.750 --> 00:27:54.760 align:start position:0%
these in other words lifting it from the
 
00:27:57.070 --> 00:27:57.080 align:start position:0%
bail commissioner and and making it go
 
00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:01.960 align:start position:0%
to a judge I do and I and the a a
 
00:28:04.549 --> 00:28:04.559 align:start position:0%
benefit of that is that the prosecutor
 
00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:06.480 align:start position:0%
will also get to go in front of the
 
00:28:08.350 --> 00:28:08.360 align:start position:0%
judge and and whether that person's held
 
00:28:10.389 --> 00:28:10.399 align:start position:0%
or not there they can recommend
 
00:28:13.470 --> 00:28:13.480 align:start position:0%
conditions of bail to the judge whereas
 
00:28:15.789 --> 00:28:15.799 align:start position:0%
you know if someone's arrested at night
 
00:28:19.110 --> 00:28:19.120 align:start position:0%
uh the bail commissioner comes in uh the
 
00:28:21.269 --> 00:28:21.279 align:start position:0%
the state the prosecutor they're not
 
00:28:24.310 --> 00:28:24.320 align:start position:0%
going to find out about this until you
 
00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:26.760 align:start position:0%
know yeah and and and if those
 
00:28:28.669 --> 00:28:28.679 align:start position:0%
conditions aren't correct or there's
 
00:28:30.070 --> 00:28:30.080 align:start position:0%
conditions that they would like added in
 
00:28:31.870 --> 00:28:31.880 align:start position:0%
there you're looking at a couple weeks
 
00:28:32.909 --> 00:28:32.919 align:start position:0%
before they're going to get a bail
 
00:28:34.430 --> 00:28:34.440 align:start position:0%
hearing because that person's released
 
00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:37.360 align:start position:0%
on PR so it's not a they're not going to
 
00:28:40.630 --> 00:28:40.640 align:start position:0%
have a a bill hearing on that um you
 
00:28:42.070 --> 00:28:42.080 align:start position:0%
know exponentially it's going to be it's
 
00:28:43.789 --> 00:28:43.799 align:start position:0%
going to be some time so you could go a
 
00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:45.880 align:start position:0%
couple weeks you could go a month with
 
00:28:49.269 --> 00:28:49.279 align:start position:0%
you know and if there's I've seen it
 
00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:50.760 align:start position:0%
happen before with there you know it's a
 
00:28:52.549 --> 00:28:52.559 align:start position:0%
DV arrest but there was never checked
 
00:28:54.149 --> 00:28:54.159 align:start position:0%
off the box for no
 
00:28:57.750 --> 00:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
contact UM and in a lot of lot of times
 
00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
we don't have a correct address where's
 
00:29:01.950 --> 00:29:01.960 align:start position:0%
that person staying now that they can't
 
00:29:04.789 --> 00:29:04.799 align:start position:0%
go back to where they were living with
 
00:29:09.230 --> 00:29:09.240 align:start position:0%
their partner and that leads down the
 
00:29:10.509 --> 00:29:10.519 align:start position:0%
you know the Court's sending them
 
00:29:12.430 --> 00:29:12.440 align:start position:0%
notices but they're sending it to the
 
00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
the address where he's not at and then
 
00:29:15.909 --> 00:29:15.919 align:start position:0%
you're racking up failure to appear is
 
00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
because they're not so there's a benefit
 
00:29:19.710 --> 00:29:19.720 align:start position:0%
of going in front of the
 
00:29:22.830 --> 00:29:22.840 align:start position:0%
judge not just to hold someone but to
 
00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:24.480 align:start position:0%
get the correct bail conditions and have
 
00:29:27.990 --> 00:29:28.000 align:start position:0%
the prosecutor have a a chance to to
 
00:29:31.350 --> 00:29:31.360 align:start position:0%
weigh in on the bill conditions with the
 
00:29:33.470 --> 00:29:33.480 align:start position:0%
judge thank you I'm going to have
 
00:29:34.830 --> 00:29:34.840 align:start position:0%
another question but I want to kind of
 
00:29:36.750 --> 00:29:36.760 align:start position:0%
set the stage for the committee
 
00:29:39.789 --> 00:29:39.799 align:start position:0%
first it's my understanding the way it
 
00:29:42.549 --> 00:29:42.559 align:start position:0%
works is the bail commissioner will will
 
00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
set bail and there will be conditions
 
00:29:48.830 --> 00:29:48.840 align:start position:0%
but when he's finished or she's finished
 
00:29:50.950 --> 00:29:50.960 align:start position:0%
they they have to take a paper
 
00:29:53.669 --> 00:29:53.679 align:start position:0%
form Fold It Up put an envelope put a
 
00:29:55.669 --> 00:29:55.679 align:start position:0%
stamp on it and mail it to the
 
00:29:59.110 --> 00:29:59.120 align:start position:0%
court so before the court even knows
 
00:30:01.669 --> 00:30:01.679 align:start position:0%
this person's out on bail it could be a
 
00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
week before the the document gets to the
 
00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:05.440 align:start position:0%
court before the court has time to open
 
00:30:07.750 --> 00:30:07.760 align:start position:0%
the envelope and enter it into a system
 
00:30:09.870 --> 00:30:09.880 align:start position:0%
so you've got people floating around for
 
00:30:12.630 --> 00:30:12.640 align:start position:0%
up to a week or more on bail with
 
00:30:16.230 --> 00:30:16.240 align:start position:0%
conditions that only he or she and the
 
00:30:19.389 --> 00:30:19.399 align:start position:0%
police that arrested them know exist so
 
00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:22.440 align:start position:0%
that person goes to another town or even
 
00:30:25.710 --> 00:30:25.720 align:start position:0%
perhaps another County um nobody knows
 
00:30:27.310 --> 00:30:27.320 align:start position:0%
about any of this and this is why
 
00:30:28.389 --> 00:30:28.399 align:start position:0%
were're taking a look at this
 
00:30:30.110 --> 00:30:30.120 align:start position:0%
comprehensively instead of just saying
 
00:30:32.029 --> 00:30:32.039 align:start position:0%
oh these crimes can't be what good does
 
00:30:35.789 --> 00:30:35.799 align:start position:0%
that do if nobody knows about it so
 
00:30:39.990 --> 00:30:40.000 align:start position:0%
um in your experience U Captain how long
 
00:30:42.590 --> 00:30:42.600 align:start position:0%
does it take and and a follow on
 
00:30:45.029 --> 00:30:45.039 align:start position:0%
question would be do you have the
 
00:30:47.029 --> 00:30:47.039 align:start position:0%
ability to arrest based on your
 
00:30:49.789 --> 00:30:49.799 align:start position:0%
knowledge of bail conditions if you see
 
00:30:53.389 --> 00:30:53.399 align:start position:0%
someone violating it for example um no
 
00:30:55.669 --> 00:30:55.679 align:start position:0%
no going to a bar or whatever and you
 
00:30:57.549 --> 00:30:57.559 align:start position:0%
see someone blatantly violing condition
 
00:31:00.190 --> 00:31:00.200 align:start position:0%
of bail that you know about personally
 
00:31:02.549 --> 00:31:02.559 align:start position:0%
if you had that that knowledge you it
 
00:31:03.990 --> 00:31:04.000 align:start position:0%
would even have to be firsthand
 
00:31:06.149 --> 00:31:06.159 align:start position:0%
knowledge that you saw that bail you saw
 
00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:08.960 align:start position:0%
that bail condition you saw the the bail
 
00:31:12.149 --> 00:31:12.159 align:start position:0%
paperwork um you bring up a good point
 
00:31:14.149 --> 00:31:14.159 align:start position:0%
because if someone's arrested in
 
00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:16.720 align:start position:0%
gtown um for domestic violence and
 
00:31:20.909 --> 00:31:20.919 align:start position:0%
they're given um conditions of bail from
 
00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
the bail commissioner um and then they
 
00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:25.200 align:start position:0%
go to
 
00:31:27.549 --> 00:31:27.559 align:start position:0%
Manchester they go that same night the
 
00:31:29.269 --> 00:31:29.279 align:start position:0%
next morning and they're in a restaurant
 
00:31:30.909 --> 00:31:30.919 align:start position:0%
with that person and the police come in
 
00:31:34.070 --> 00:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
contact with them unless they know to
 
00:31:36.149 --> 00:31:36.159 align:start position:0%
call over to gown to check they're not
 
00:31:39.070 --> 00:31:39.080 align:start position:0%
going to know that that person has
 
00:31:41.470 --> 00:31:41.480 align:start position:0%
bail and does that apply to protective
 
00:31:43.509 --> 00:31:43.519 align:start position:0%
orders as well I mean if someone in your
 
00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:44.960 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction in golf town gets a
 
00:31:47.350 --> 00:31:47.360 align:start position:0%
protective order against their spouse
 
00:31:49.870 --> 00:31:49.880 align:start position:0%
and they get into a domestic altercation
 
00:31:52.909 --> 00:31:52.919 align:start position:0%
in Manchester you know 3 4 days later
 
00:31:54.549 --> 00:31:54.559 align:start position:0%
does the Manchester police even know
 
00:31:56.870 --> 00:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
that a protective order exists if it's
 
00:32:00.190 --> 00:32:00.200 align:start position:0%
in the system and I can't speak to the
 
00:32:03.549 --> 00:32:03.559 align:start position:0%
for the court as to what the timeline is
 
00:32:05.990 --> 00:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
or when that is entered into the system
 
00:32:09.190 --> 00:32:09.200 align:start position:0%
so uh I do know in
 
00:32:11.669 --> 00:32:11.679 align:start position:0%
um well it does wouldn't happen too much
 
00:32:14.310 --> 00:32:14.320 align:start position:0%
but if we do if we you know gwn police
 
00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:15.350 align:start position:0%
but if we do if we you know gwn police
will

00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
will
 
00:32:17.990 --> 00:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
notify you know if the person lives in
 
00:32:20.509 --> 00:32:20.519 align:start position:0%
Manchester you know we may zip like a
 
00:32:23.669 --> 00:32:23.679 align:start position:0%
fax over but often times I I don't know
 
00:32:26.509 --> 00:32:26.519 align:start position:0%
how quick that gets in the system well
 
00:32:29.389 --> 00:32:29.399 align:start position:0%
what we know let's just talk about not
 
00:32:31.430 --> 00:32:31.440 align:start position:0%
let's not talk about orders issued in
 
00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
the court because that should
 
00:32:34.509 --> 00:32:34.519 align:start position:0%
theoretically be in the system right
 
00:32:36.549 --> 00:32:36.559 align:start position:0%
away but let's talk about emergency
 
00:32:38.430 --> 00:32:38.440 align:start position:0%
orders that are issued over a weekend or
 
00:32:41.149 --> 00:32:41.159 align:start position:0%
holiday or a Friday
 
00:32:43.950 --> 00:32:43.960 align:start position:0%
night is there any way for another
 
00:32:47.350 --> 00:32:47.360 align:start position:0%
department barring you faxing around the
 
00:32:48.950 --> 00:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
state for them to know that there's a
 
00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:52.669 align:start position:0%
state for them to know that there's a
protective

00:32:52.669 --> 00:32:52.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:56.029 --> 00:32:56.039 align:start position:0%
order I'm unaware of
 
00:32:56.039 --> 00:32:59.029 align:start position:0%
order I'm unaware of
that

00:32:59.029 --> 00:32:59.039 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:33:01.269 --> 00:33:01.279 align:start position:0%
that's all I had a minut representative
 
00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
Stone thank you Mr chairman one of the
 
00:33:05.549 --> 00:33:05.559 align:start position:0%
questions I have is that your agency
 
00:33:07.470 --> 00:33:07.480 align:start position:0%
when a bail commissioner comes in do you
 
00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
provide them with a probable cause
 
00:33:12.269 --> 00:33:12.279 align:start position:0%
affidavit or supportive
 
00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:15.720 align:start position:0%
arrest um they
 
00:33:18.070 --> 00:33:18.080 align:start position:0%
will have
 
00:33:21.389 --> 00:33:21.399 align:start position:0%
the by the when the bail commissioner is
 
00:33:24.310 --> 00:33:24.320 align:start position:0%
there often times the the the guy is
 
00:33:26.110 --> 00:33:26.120 align:start position:0%
arrested he brought in he goes into
 
00:33:27.750 --> 00:33:27.760 align:start position:0%
booking the bail commit will come and
 
00:33:29.430 --> 00:33:29.440 align:start position:0%
say what are the
 
00:33:31.990 --> 00:33:32.000 align:start position:0%
charges but there's no report done at
 
00:33:35.830 --> 00:33:35.840 align:start position:0%
that point so we we for domestic
 
00:33:37.950 --> 00:33:37.960 align:start position:0%
violence they're brought in their arrest
 
00:33:40.070 --> 00:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
they go into booking the officer is
 
00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:43.440 align:start position:0%
there booking him or her
 
00:33:45.750 --> 00:33:45.760 align:start position:0%
and they'll call the bail
 
00:33:48.750 --> 00:33:48.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner while he's doing his you
 
00:33:50.350 --> 00:33:50.360 align:start position:0%
know getting the fingerprints going
 
00:33:53.669 --> 00:33:53.679 align:start position:0%
through the list of um you know his
 
00:33:56.110 --> 00:33:56.120 align:start position:0%
background and name and running they'll
 
00:33:57.470 --> 00:33:57.480 align:start position:0%
run his
 
00:34:00.269 --> 00:34:00.279 align:start position:0%
um criminal record and we have a
 
00:34:02.710 --> 00:34:02.720 align:start position:0%
dispatch right in our Police Department
 
00:34:05.470 --> 00:34:05.480 align:start position:0%
so dispatch will run that criminal
 
00:34:07.350 --> 00:34:07.360 align:start position:0%
record and give it to the officer so the
 
00:34:09.510 --> 00:34:09.520 align:start position:0%
bail commissioner will really only have
 
00:34:10.629 --> 00:34:10.639 align:start position:0%
and we're lucky enough to have a
 
00:34:13.710 --> 00:34:13.720 align:start position:0%
dispatch in our um Police Department so
 
00:34:17.990 --> 00:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
we have access to um run a criminal
 
00:34:20.270 --> 00:34:20.280 align:start position:0%
record 24 hours seven days a week
 
00:34:21.430 --> 00:34:21.440 align:start position:0%
there's police departments that don't
 
00:34:23.710 --> 00:34:23.720 align:start position:0%
have that luxury so all the baill
 
00:34:24.750 --> 00:34:24.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner is going to see is the
 
00:34:27.589 --> 00:34:27.599 align:start position:0%
charges and his criminal history
 
00:34:27.599 --> 00:34:28.669 align:start position:0%
charges and his criminal history
follow

00:34:28.669 --> 00:34:28.679 align:start position:0%
follow
 
00:34:31.349 --> 00:34:31.359 align:start position:0%
up in addition uh is it typical for a
 
00:34:32.829 --> 00:34:32.839 align:start position:0%
bill commissioner or the officer to kind
 
00:34:34.909 --> 00:34:34.919 align:start position:0%
of give a quick uh rundown of the
 
00:34:38.190 --> 00:34:38.200 align:start position:0%
charges that are pending at that time he
 
00:34:42.149 --> 00:34:42.159 align:start position:0%
be having Bill Set uh previous charges
 
00:34:43.430 --> 00:34:43.440 align:start position:0%
or no no the current charges when
 
00:34:44.669 --> 00:34:44.679 align:start position:0%
someone's arrested and they're in the
 
00:34:46.349 --> 00:34:46.359 align:start position:0%
booking area and the bail commission
 
00:34:48.270 --> 00:34:48.280 align:start position:0%
comes in does typically the officer of
 
00:34:50.230 --> 00:34:50.240 align:start position:0%
your department that you may or may not
 
00:34:52.190 --> 00:34:52.200 align:start position:0%
be aware of kind of give a synopsis of
 
00:34:54.629 --> 00:34:54.639 align:start position:0%
what brought that person into
 
00:34:57.430 --> 00:34:57.440 align:start position:0%
custody not all the time
 
00:35:00.270 --> 00:35:00.280 align:start position:0%
um if there's extending circumstances
 
00:35:02.109 --> 00:35:02.119 align:start position:0%
they made but there really only the bill
 
00:35:04.589 --> 00:35:04.599 align:start position:0%
commission is only seeing the charge in
 
00:35:04.599 --> 00:35:06.230 align:start position:0%
commission is only seeing the charge in
his

00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:06.240 align:start position:0%
his
 
00:35:09.510 --> 00:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
history so they don't give them for
 
00:35:10.990 --> 00:35:11.000 align:start position:0%
example you have a domestic violence
 
00:35:12.910 --> 00:35:12.920 align:start position:0%
arrest the the bill commissioner only
 
00:35:14.710 --> 00:35:14.720 align:start position:0%
sees domestic violence arrest he doesn't
 
00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
say you don't explain okay yeah he he
 
00:35:19.870 --> 00:35:19.880 align:start position:0%
actually we saw him beating up his wife
 
00:35:22.230 --> 00:35:22.240 align:start position:0%
or there's no background at all they
 
00:35:23.710 --> 00:35:23.720 align:start position:0%
will give a quick background but they're
 
00:35:26.910 --> 00:35:26.920 align:start position:0%
not going to have a full out G or prob
 
00:35:29.109 --> 00:35:29.119 align:start position:0%
cost affidavit and you know they'll ask
 
00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
for um you know what was the victim's
 
00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:35.560 align:start position:0%
name should be no contact and um and and
 
00:35:38.190 --> 00:35:38.200 align:start position:0%
in those questions they'll ask but
 
00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:40.480 align:start position:0%
they're not um the officer hasn't even
 
00:35:41.950 --> 00:35:41.960 align:start position:0%
sat at the computer yet and started
 
00:35:44.069 --> 00:35:44.079 align:start position:0%
typing until usually the bail
 
00:35:46.190 --> 00:35:46.200 align:start position:0%
commissioner has left and and that uh
 
00:35:48.870 --> 00:35:48.880 align:start position:0%
defendant has been released and that's
 
00:35:50.309 --> 00:35:50.319 align:start position:0%
assuming the officer wasn't injured
 
00:35:52.069 --> 00:35:52.079 align:start position:0%
during the arrest what do you do in a
 
00:35:54.390 --> 00:35:54.400 align:start position:0%
case where that happens I mean that
 
00:35:57.550 --> 00:35:57.560 align:start position:0%
won't that wouldn't um you know if he's
 
00:35:58.829 --> 00:35:58.839 align:start position:0%
if the officer is you know at the
 
00:36:01.589 --> 00:36:01.599 align:start position:0%
hospital they not you go to you know
 
00:36:04.030 --> 00:36:04.040 align:start position:0%
City's Nashville Manchester that officer
 
00:36:05.670 --> 00:36:05.680 align:start position:0%
that makes the
 
00:36:07.710 --> 00:36:07.720 align:start position:0%
arrest you know they may not even
 
00:36:09.670 --> 00:36:09.680 align:start position:0%
transport them back to the police
 
00:36:12.230 --> 00:36:12.240 align:start position:0%
department if they go in the the wagon
 
00:36:13.990 --> 00:36:14.000 align:start position:0%
or they bring him to the booking they
 
00:36:15.109 --> 00:36:15.119 align:start position:0%
drop them off and there's a booking
 
00:36:19.829 --> 00:36:19.839 align:start position:0%
officer then will take down here's his
 
00:36:21.829 --> 00:36:21.839 align:start position:0%
charges and then the bail commissioner
 
00:36:23.109 --> 00:36:23.119 align:start position:0%
will come in and speak to the booking
 
00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:25.720 align:start position:0%
officer who wasn't even at the
 
00:36:28.870 --> 00:36:28.880 align:start position:0%
scene and it can take a while for the
 
00:36:30.670 --> 00:36:30.680 align:start position:0%
officer to get have an opportunity to
 
00:36:32.510 --> 00:36:32.520 align:start position:0%
write the report right if he has to go
 
00:36:34.430 --> 00:36:34.440 align:start position:0%
to hospital first or it could still be
 
00:36:39.470 --> 00:36:39.480 align:start position:0%
at the scene yeah yeah okay excellent
 
00:36:42.150 --> 00:36:42.160 align:start position:0%
um hold on a second I had a few other
 
00:36:44.430 --> 00:36:44.440 align:start position:0%
questions that this this line has
 
00:36:47.870 --> 00:36:47.880 align:start position:0%
brought up um so we're we're
 
00:36:49.910 --> 00:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
contemplating and we've just discussed
 
00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
um possibly um if if we have this list
 
00:36:56.390 --> 00:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
of crimes and the person is non-bailable
 
00:36:58.710 --> 00:36:58.720 align:start position:0%
by bail commissioner and we were to
 
00:37:01.270 --> 00:37:01.280 align:start position:0%
require a judge to do a hearing on on a
 
00:37:03.870 --> 00:37:03.880 align:start position:0%
weekend do do you have any other
 
00:37:06.270 --> 00:37:06.280 align:start position:0%
instances where you contact uh judicial
 
00:37:10.069 --> 00:37:10.079 align:start position:0%
system over the weekend we do um for you
 
00:37:10.079 --> 00:37:11.030 align:start position:0%
system over the weekend we do um for you
know

00:37:11.030 --> 00:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:37:13.589 --> 00:37:13.599 align:start position:0%
emergency um protective
 
00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
orders uh emergency um you know search
 
00:37:20.150 --> 00:37:20.160 align:start position:0%
warrants uh judges are available by
 
00:37:22.910 --> 00:37:22.920 align:start position:0%

00:37:24.470 --> 00:37:24.480 align:start position:0%
emergency arrest warrants search
 
00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
warrants protective orders would you
 
00:37:29.790 --> 00:37:29.800 align:start position:0%
give us just an example uh just a kind
 
00:37:31.750 --> 00:37:31.760 align:start position:0%
of a rundown how that would work do you
 
00:37:33.750 --> 00:37:33.760 align:start position:0%
fax them do you guys Zoom how do you do
 
00:37:36.870 --> 00:37:36.880 align:start position:0%
it so we we have a would' be a would
 
00:37:40.710 --> 00:37:40.720 align:start position:0%
call the on call Judge we have a list um
 
00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:42.640 align:start position:0%
they the county will give us of the
 
00:37:46.670 --> 00:37:46.680 align:start position:0%
judges that are on call and they'll ask
 
00:37:48.550 --> 00:37:48.560 align:start position:0%
you know for instance say it's a felony
 
00:37:50.589 --> 00:37:50.599 align:start position:0%
domestic violence and we need an arrest
 
00:37:52.950 --> 00:37:52.960 align:start position:0%
warrant um and we can't you know you're
 
00:37:54.990 --> 00:37:55.000 align:start position:0%
not going to wait because you're not
 
00:37:56.950 --> 00:37:56.960 align:start position:0%
going to wait till Monday because of the
 
00:38:00.030 --> 00:38:00.040 align:start position:0%
danger it poses to the victim so the the
 
00:38:03.470 --> 00:38:03.480 align:start position:0%
judge will um you officer would call the
 
00:38:06.710 --> 00:38:06.720 align:start position:0%
judge say this is what we
 
00:38:11.309 --> 00:38:11.319 align:start position:0%
have here excuse me here she would say
 
00:38:14.150 --> 00:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
you know can you either email majority
 
00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:15.760 align:start position:0%
of time it's email they don't have fax
 
00:38:18.270 --> 00:38:18.280 align:start position:0%
machines at their house but email or fax
 
00:38:21.829 --> 00:38:21.839 align:start position:0%
me um your affidavit and warrant and
 
00:38:23.910 --> 00:38:23.920 align:start position:0%
stay on the phone and the judge will
 
00:38:26.950 --> 00:38:26.960 align:start position:0%
read that have any questions asked and
 
00:38:31.190 --> 00:38:31.200 align:start position:0%
then you know zip it back to the officer
 
00:38:33.030 --> 00:38:33.040 align:start position:0%
um electronically and now that the they
 
00:38:36.109 --> 00:38:36.119 align:start position:0%
do have a new the court does have an new
 
00:38:38.470 --> 00:38:38.480 align:start position:0%
electronic system of signing those but
 
00:38:40.710 --> 00:38:40.720 align:start position:0%
they will call the judge to bring it to
 
00:38:43.030 --> 00:38:43.040 align:start position:0%
their attention
 
00:38:45.150 --> 00:38:45.160 align:start position:0%
immediately okay so the court does have
 
00:38:47.510 --> 00:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
some experience with exchanging evidence
 
00:38:49.109 --> 00:38:49.119 align:start position:0%
with the officers and talking to them
 
00:38:52.030 --> 00:38:52.040 align:start position:0%
over the weekend sure so adding um very
 
00:38:53.950 --> 00:38:53.960 align:start position:0%
serious crimes that would require them
 
00:38:56.790 --> 00:38:56.800 align:start position:0%
to make a decision on bail wouldn't be
 
00:38:59.390 --> 00:38:59.400 align:start position:0%
that big of a stretch or or at least not
 
00:39:02.109 --> 00:39:02.119 align:start position:0%
totally alien to them I don't want to
 
00:39:03.950 --> 00:39:03.960 align:start position:0%
speak for them but we do contact judges
 
00:39:05.309 --> 00:39:05.319 align:start position:0%
on nights and
 
00:39:08.150 --> 00:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
weekends thank you
 
00:39:11.470 --> 00:39:11.480 align:start position:0%
um back to yeah how often does that
 
00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:13.190 align:start position:0%
um back to yeah how often does that
occur

00:39:13.190 --> 00:39:13.200 align:start position:0%
occur
 
00:39:16.870 --> 00:39:16.880 align:start position:0%
roughly once a week couple times a I I
 
00:39:20.950 --> 00:39:20.960 align:start position:0%
would I would say um Ju Just for go
 
00:39:23.309 --> 00:39:23.319 align:start position:0%
towns yeah maybe once a week you know a
 
00:39:26.589 --> 00:39:26.599 align:start position:0%
few times a month if you were to ask
 
00:39:30.030 --> 00:39:30.040 align:start position:0%
aldenberg and Manchester I would say
 
00:39:32.990 --> 00:39:33.000 align:start position:0%
daily okay um something else you brought
 
00:39:34.670 --> 00:39:34.680 align:start position:0%
up that that's interesting in the
 
00:39:36.470 --> 00:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
committee I I I know it but the
 
00:39:38.510 --> 00:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
committee I think needs to know it there
 
00:39:40.550 --> 00:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
are police departments and I want you to
 
00:39:43.230 --> 00:39:43.240 align:start position:0%
correct my statements that in this state
 
00:39:45.589 --> 00:39:45.599 align:start position:0%
that cannot sit down and run uh someone
 
00:39:47.270 --> 00:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
they just arrested they cannot run their
 
00:39:50.190 --> 00:39:50.200 align:start position:0%
criminal record is that is that accurate
 
00:39:52.109 --> 00:39:52.119 align:start position:0%
uh I yeah I have heard that if they
 
00:39:53.710 --> 00:39:53.720 align:start position:0%
don't have a Dispatch Center they don't
 
00:39:57.750 --> 00:39:57.760 align:start position:0%
have um access to do that um yeah
 
00:39:58.670 --> 00:39:58.680 align:start position:0%
they're not going to be able to run a
 
00:40:01.349 --> 00:40:01.359 align:start position:0%
triple ey or a criminal history and do
 
00:40:03.150 --> 00:40:03.160 align:start position:0%
you run a a triple ey for the committee
 
00:40:05.230 --> 00:40:05.240 align:start position:0%
is a is a federal check with the FBI
 
00:40:06.630 --> 00:40:06.640 align:start position:0%
that shows their record across the
 
00:40:08.829 --> 00:40:08.839 align:start position:0%
country um do you run a triple I on
 
00:40:12.430 --> 00:40:12.440 align:start position:0%
everyd yes okay um and you run an
 
00:40:15.670 --> 00:40:15.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire record check as well yes okay
 
00:40:17.589 --> 00:40:17.599 align:start position:0%
so there are departments as best of your
 
00:40:19.950 --> 00:40:19.960 align:start position:0%
knowledge um probably in more Rural and
 
00:40:21.950 --> 00:40:21.960 align:start position:0%
Northern sections of the state that
 
00:40:23.790 --> 00:40:23.800 align:start position:0%
don't even have a computer terminal
 
00:40:25.790 --> 00:40:25.800 align:start position:0%
where they can sit down and check the
 
00:40:28.710 --> 00:40:28.720 align:start position:0%
record the person they have in custody
 
00:40:30.910 --> 00:40:30.920 align:start position:0%
meaning that they could potentially be a
 
00:40:32.990 --> 00:40:33.000 align:start position:0%
fugitive from Justice from the state
 
00:40:34.230 --> 00:40:34.240 align:start position:0%
they could be there could be any number
 
00:40:35.670 --> 00:40:35.680 align:start position:0%
of things yeah that the police just
 
00:40:37.349 --> 00:40:37.359 align:start position:0%
don't have access to is that accurate
 
00:40:39.030 --> 00:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
yeah they they if they they have a
 
00:40:41.550 --> 00:40:41.560 align:start position:0%
Dispatch Center outside Dispatch Center
 
00:40:44.710 --> 00:40:44.720 align:start position:0%
like a county or and they they're
 
00:40:47.270 --> 00:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
not their Dispatch Center is probably
 
00:40:49.109 --> 00:40:49.119 align:start position:0%
running that for them and then they're
 
00:40:51.030 --> 00:40:51.040 align:start position:0%
going to have to make their way at some
 
00:40:53.670 --> 00:40:53.680 align:start position:0%
point over there to pick it up um there
 
00:40:57.109 --> 00:40:57.119 align:start position:0%
are a a triple eyes you know you can't
 
00:41:00.030 --> 00:41:00.040 align:start position:0%
email them there's very strict um
 
00:41:03.670 --> 00:41:03.680 align:start position:0%
security measures um with the records so
 
00:41:06.069 --> 00:41:06.079 align:start position:0%
I I would assume that they have to would
 
00:41:07.990 --> 00:41:08.000 align:start position:0%
have to drive to that Dispatch Center
 
00:41:10.190 --> 00:41:10.200 align:start position:0%
wherever it is wherever it was printed
 
00:41:11.910 --> 00:41:11.920 align:start position:0%
to get it and that that may not be that
 
00:41:14.309 --> 00:41:14.319 align:start position:0%
shift that may not be that day um they
 
00:41:16.430 --> 00:41:16.440 align:start position:0%
may just make a trip once a week I don't
 
00:41:18.990 --> 00:41:19.000 align:start position:0%
know I don't we don't but I have heard
 
00:41:21.069 --> 00:41:21.079 align:start position:0%
that that if they don't have a Dispatch
 
00:41:22.990 --> 00:41:23.000 align:start position:0%
Center they're they're not running it in
 
00:41:24.309 --> 00:41:24.319 align:start position:0%
house and they're not going to have it
 
00:41:28.190 --> 00:41:28.200 align:start position:0%
on hand and if there are many police
 
00:41:29.470 --> 00:41:29.480 align:start position:0%
departments in the state that may only
 
00:41:30.950 --> 00:41:30.960 align:start position:0%
have one officer on it night is that
 
00:41:33.910 --> 00:41:33.920 align:start position:0%
correct a lot so you've got one officer
 
00:41:35.230 --> 00:41:35.240 align:start position:0%
with somebody in
 
00:41:39.030 --> 00:41:39.040 align:start position:0%
custody it's um not really reasonable to
 
00:41:40.430 --> 00:41:40.440 align:start position:0%
assume he's going to be able to drive to
 
00:41:42.829 --> 00:41:42.839 align:start position:0%
a Dispatch Center that maybe you know 20
 
00:41:45.630 --> 00:41:45.640 align:start position:0%
miles away now go gtown police our
 
00:41:47.589 --> 00:41:47.599 align:start position:0%
Dispatch Center also dispatches for New
 
00:41:50.270 --> 00:41:50.280 align:start position:0%
Boston police um wear police and
 
00:41:52.870 --> 00:41:52.880 align:start position:0%
Dunbarton police
 
00:41:56.589 --> 00:41:56.599 align:start position:0%
um New Boston and and Dunbarton often
 
00:41:58.829 --> 00:41:58.839 align:start position:0%
only have one officer on I don't think
 
00:42:00.270 --> 00:42:00.280 align:start position:0%
if they have two it's during the day
 
00:42:02.910 --> 00:42:02.920 align:start position:0%
because the chief is there when they
 
00:42:05.190 --> 00:42:05.200 align:start position:0%
make an arrest our Dispatch Center runs
 
00:42:08.390 --> 00:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
their triple ey we may not see them they
 
00:42:10.870 --> 00:42:10.880 align:start position:0%
may go to their own you know they may
 
00:42:13.109 --> 00:42:13.119 align:start position:0%
write you know do the booking at their
 
00:42:15.470 --> 00:42:15.480 align:start position:0%
place not come and we you know we'll put
 
00:42:17.069 --> 00:42:17.079 align:start position:0%
it aside for them when they come to pick
 
00:42:19.630 --> 00:42:19.640 align:start position:0%
it up are you allowed to broadcast over
 
00:42:22.109 --> 00:42:22.119 align:start position:0%
the radio if there's the the contents of
 
00:42:24.030 --> 00:42:24.040 align:start position:0%
the triple ey to tell the officer this
 
00:42:25.150 --> 00:42:25.160 align:start position:0%
is what you
 
00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:27.270 align:start position:0%
is what you
got

00:42:27.270 --> 00:42:27.280 align:start position:0%
got
 
00:42:31.349 --> 00:42:31.359 align:start position:0%
I I don't know the par I I don't know
 
00:42:34.910 --> 00:42:34.920 align:start position:0%
that um you don't hear it but I don't
 
00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:35.870 align:start position:0%
that um you don't hear it but I don't
know

00:42:35.870 --> 00:42:35.880 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:42:38.630 --> 00:42:38.640 align:start position:0%
if I don't know if that is uh breaches
 
00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
any security things with there it might
 
00:42:43.390 --> 00:42:43.400 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure could you check on it check
 
00:42:46.270 --> 00:42:46.280 align:start position:0%
that y also what about um out of state
 
00:42:47.910 --> 00:42:47.920 align:start position:0%
warrants you know you got your fugitive
 
00:42:49.790 --> 00:42:49.800 align:start position:0%
from justice warrants you could have
 
00:42:51.230 --> 00:42:51.240 align:start position:0%
someone you pick up who's got a warrant
 
00:42:54.270 --> 00:42:54.280 align:start position:0%
out of Illinois um uh is the Dispatch
 
00:42:56.190 --> 00:42:56.200 align:start position:0%
Center allowed to say that to us you're
 
00:42:58.069 --> 00:42:58.079 align:start position:0%
knowledge say this guy's got uh he's
 
00:43:01.390 --> 00:43:01.400 align:start position:0%
wanted from yes and that happens often
 
00:43:03.190 --> 00:43:03.200 align:start position:0%
now in that case how how do you handle
 
00:43:04.870 --> 00:43:04.880 align:start position:0%
fugitive from justices with regard to
 
00:43:07.589 --> 00:43:07.599 align:start position:0%
the bail Commissioners in the bail
 
00:43:11.390 --> 00:43:11.400 align:start position:0%
system it um it depends if it's
 
00:43:13.390 --> 00:43:13.400 align:start position:0%
extraditable um you know often times
 
00:43:15.510 --> 00:43:15.520 align:start position:0%
they'll have a warrant that isn't in New
 
00:43:18.390 --> 00:43:18.400 align:start position:0%
England uh could be out of Texas but it
 
00:43:21.309 --> 00:43:21.319 align:start position:0%
it says only surrounding states um so we
 
00:43:23.670 --> 00:43:23.680 align:start position:0%
won't be able to we won't be able to
 
00:43:25.349 --> 00:43:25.359 align:start position:0%
take them into custody on that if it's
 
00:43:27.109 --> 00:43:27.119 align:start position:0%
one that we can take them into custody
 
00:43:30.390 --> 00:43:30.400 align:start position:0%
say it's um it says you know arrestable
 
00:43:32.470 --> 00:43:32.480 align:start position:0%
in New England states that's often what
 
00:43:36.790 --> 00:43:36.800 align:start position:0%
you see um we'll take them into custody
 
00:43:41.230 --> 00:43:41.240 align:start position:0%
uh we will hold them um contact the
 
00:43:44.549 --> 00:43:44.559 align:start position:0%
agency with their warrant is out of to
 
00:43:46.829 --> 00:43:46.839 align:start position:0%
see if they're going to come get them
 
00:43:48.510 --> 00:43:48.520 align:start position:0%
because that's a question the judge will
 
00:43:50.950 --> 00:43:50.960 align:start position:0%
ask is this agency going to come get
 
00:43:52.109 --> 00:43:52.119 align:start position:0%
them because I'm not going to hold them
 
00:43:55.829 --> 00:43:55.839 align:start position:0%
if they're not um so that that's the the
 
00:43:59.790 --> 00:43:59.800 align:start position:0%
way we go with that um and it when the
 
00:44:01.190 --> 00:44:01.200 align:start position:0%
agency says they're going to come up the
 
00:44:02.829 --> 00:44:02.839 align:start position:0%
judge usually wants them within seven
 
00:44:06.549 --> 00:44:06.559 align:start position:0%
days to come pick this um defending up
 
00:44:09.829 --> 00:44:09.839 align:start position:0%
so for example for the committee you
 
00:44:12.910 --> 00:44:12.920 align:start position:0%
could have somebody um with a warrant
 
00:44:14.950 --> 00:44:14.960 align:start position:0%
out of California for failure to pay a
 
00:44:17.230 --> 00:44:17.240 align:start position:0%
fine generally speaking that state is
 
00:44:19.589 --> 00:44:19.599 align:start position:0%
not going to spend thousands of dollars
 
00:44:21.990 --> 00:44:22.000 align:start position:0%
for several officers to fly to New
 
00:44:23.950 --> 00:44:23.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to pick up someone who owes a
 
00:44:26.670 --> 00:44:26.680 align:start position:0%
$100 fine that's I think what the what
 
00:44:27.910 --> 00:44:27.920 align:start position:0%
you're trying to no they're not going to
 
00:44:29.750 --> 00:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
to you we'll see it a lot a lot of time
 
00:44:32.990 --> 00:44:33.000 align:start position:0%
out of New York um and you exactly or
 
00:44:35.950 --> 00:44:35.960 align:start position:0%
low you know a lowlevel crime and and
 
00:44:37.309 --> 00:44:37.319 align:start position:0%
they're just like we're not we're not
 
00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
coming you know if they get picked up in
 
00:44:40.750 --> 00:44:40.760 align:start position:0%
state they'd hold them but they're not
 
00:44:42.270 --> 00:44:42.280 align:start position:0%
going to come out of state to pick that
 
00:44:45.150 --> 00:44:45.160 align:start position:0%
person up do you know if New Hampshire
 
00:44:48.270 --> 00:44:48.280 align:start position:0%
um as a state do we have any policy on
 
00:44:49.670 --> 00:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
um people that are running around our
 
00:44:51.829 --> 00:44:51.839 align:start position:0%
state with warrants out of other states
 
00:44:54.750 --> 00:44:54.760 align:start position:0%
do do we anyway do anything about it or
 
00:44:58.750 --> 00:44:58.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:03.630 --> 00:45:03.640 align:start position:0%
um it when we so say I enter a
 
00:45:07.390 --> 00:45:07.400 align:start position:0%
warrant and I put it in
 
00:45:10.630 --> 00:45:10.640 align:start position:0%
NCI that you have to check off do you
 
00:45:13.349 --> 00:45:13.359 align:start position:0%
want this person arrested out of state
 
00:45:16.230 --> 00:45:16.240 align:start position:0%
you know in how you know do you can
 
00:45:18.589 --> 00:45:18.599 align:start position:0%
check off Nationwide New England or
 
00:45:22.670 --> 00:45:22.680 align:start position:0%
neighboring states so if we have people
 
00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:24.880 align:start position:0%
running around New Hampshire with States
 
00:45:28.109 --> 00:45:28.119 align:start position:0%
from out with warrants from out of state
 
00:45:31.390 --> 00:45:31.400 align:start position:0%
we can only arrest them if it says that
 
00:45:33.630 --> 00:45:33.640 align:start position:0%
we're able to so for instance it's
 
00:45:35.630 --> 00:45:35.640 align:start position:0%
California and it says neighboring
 
00:45:37.829 --> 00:45:37.839 align:start position:0%
states we can run them he could have a
 
00:45:39.510 --> 00:45:39.520 align:start position:0%
felony warrant out of California we
 
00:45:43.030 --> 00:45:43.040 align:start position:0%
can't arrest them but if it says um you
 
00:45:44.829 --> 00:45:44.839 align:start position:0%
know Massachusetts they get a warrant
 
00:45:47.030 --> 00:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
out of Massachusetts and it says
 
00:45:50.109 --> 00:45:50.119 align:start position:0%
extraditable for neighboring states we
 
00:45:53.630 --> 00:45:53.640 align:start position:0%
can arrest it it depends on the issuing
 
00:45:55.430 --> 00:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
agency what they do with the warrant
 
00:45:57.870 --> 00:45:57.880 align:start position:0%
that will dictate how we can take them
 
00:46:00.990 --> 00:46:01.000 align:start position:0%
into custody many states and correct me
 
00:46:04.109 --> 00:46:04.119 align:start position:0%
again if I'm wrong have a system whereby
 
00:46:06.589 --> 00:46:06.599 align:start position:0%
if you have a warrant at some point your
 
00:46:09.069 --> 00:46:09.079 align:start position:0%
driver's license gets attached and you
 
00:46:12.910 --> 00:46:12.920 align:start position:0%
lose your they they suspend it um if
 
00:46:15.109 --> 00:46:15.119 align:start position:0%
someone's license is suspended in
 
00:46:18.109 --> 00:46:18.119 align:start position:0%
California for a warrant or failure to
 
00:46:20.829 --> 00:46:20.839 align:start position:0%
pay a child support or something we do
 
00:46:22.829 --> 00:46:22.839 align:start position:0%
recognize that and their New Hampshire
 
00:46:24.710 --> 00:46:24.720 align:start position:0%
license would also be suspended is that
 
00:46:26.309 --> 00:46:26.319 align:start position:0%
is that your understanding
 
00:46:28.829 --> 00:46:28.839 align:start position:0%
yes they would be you could arrest them
 
00:46:30.710 --> 00:46:30.720 align:start position:0%
for you know operating without a valid
 
00:46:32.710 --> 00:46:32.720 align:start position:0%
license but you you know if the unless
 
00:46:35.549 --> 00:46:35.559 align:start position:0%
that charge is extraditable we can't
 
00:46:38.150 --> 00:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
arrest it to that okay any other any
 
00:46:41.230 --> 00:46:41.240 align:start position:0%
other questions for the captain based on
 
00:46:43.349 --> 00:46:43.359 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to call him representative
 
00:46:44.589 --> 00:46:44.599 align:start position:0%
scitech did you want to ask a question
 
00:46:54.790 --> 00:46:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:57.750 align:start position:0%
 
yourself

00:46:57.750 --> 00:46:57.760 align:start position:0%
yourself
 
00:47:00.750 --> 00:47:00.760 align:start position:0%
so to just to add some more to the to
 
00:47:03.150 --> 00:47:03.160 align:start position:0%
the cabin's testimony if they picked up
 
00:47:05.030 --> 00:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
someone from
 
00:47:07.309 --> 00:47:07.319 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts which said neighboring
 
00:47:09.390 --> 00:47:09.400 align:start position:0%
states they wouldn't even have to call
 
00:47:11.230 --> 00:47:11.240 align:start position:0%
the bill commissioner because it's not
 
00:47:17.589 --> 00:47:17.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:19.510 --> 00:47:19.520 align:start position:0%
says that's where we go in front of the
 
00:47:21.230 --> 00:47:21.240 align:start position:0%
judge and that that's the questions the
 
00:47:23.870 --> 00:47:23.880 align:start position:0%
judge will ask okay I was talking about
 
00:47:28.589 --> 00:47:28.599 align:start position:0%
repres thank you for question um so the
 
00:47:31.069 --> 00:47:31.079 align:start position:0%
uh nonviolent crimes are down violent
 
00:47:35.349 --> 00:47:35.359 align:start position:0%
crimes are up how how longer the are the
 
00:47:37.950 --> 00:47:37.960 align:start position:0%
um uh defendants being held you know
 
00:47:39.750 --> 00:47:39.760 align:start position:0%
during the week they're probably in and
 
00:47:42.510 --> 00:47:42.520 align:start position:0%
out within 24 hours but what's your
 
00:47:45.589 --> 00:47:45.599 align:start position:0%
experience with you know how long is an
 
00:47:49.510 --> 00:47:49.520 align:start position:0%
average hold for a person with a charge
 
00:47:52.470 --> 00:47:52.480 align:start position:0%
with a violent crime are they in and out
 
00:47:54.910 --> 00:47:54.920 align:start position:0%
what how long is the told that's getting
 
00:47:56.910 --> 00:47:56.920 align:start position:0%
PR bailed or that's going in front of a
 
00:47:59.510 --> 00:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
judge so so somebody gets arrested for
 
00:48:02.710 --> 00:48:02.720 align:start position:0%
um carjacking with a weapon or
 
00:48:05.030 --> 00:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
whatever that you get arrested uh
 
00:48:07.270 --> 00:48:07.280 align:start position:0%
charged with a violent crime with a
 
00:48:11.349 --> 00:48:11.359 align:start position:0%
weapon and it's a Friday how long is is
 
00:48:14.309 --> 00:48:14.319 align:start position:0%
that person held are they just are you
 
00:48:15.829 --> 00:48:15.839 align:start position:0%
talking about they're not making bail
 
00:48:16.950 --> 00:48:16.960 align:start position:0%
they're not getting PR bail they're
 
00:48:19.549 --> 00:48:19.559 align:start position:0%
going to go in front of a judge could so
 
00:48:21.470 --> 00:48:21.480 align:start position:0%
there's no way they can get bail so if
 
00:48:23.109 --> 00:48:23.119 align:start position:0%
they don't go okay so so if they get
 
00:48:25.750 --> 00:48:25.760 align:start position:0%
arrested Friday they would be um
 
00:48:28.670 --> 00:48:28.680 align:start position:0%
arraigned the next court day Monday so
 
00:48:31.349 --> 00:48:31.359 align:start position:0%
is that common I mean do you see most
 
00:48:35.069 --> 00:48:35.079 align:start position:0%
people held greater than 24 hours or are
 
00:48:38.390 --> 00:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
most people released within 24 hours is
 
00:48:42.270 --> 00:48:42.280 align:start position:0%
the 24hour hold or greater common
 
00:48:44.750 --> 00:48:44.760 align:start position:0%
place they're usually released that next
 
00:48:47.430 --> 00:48:47.440 align:start position:0%
court date so it it would be less than
 
00:48:49.750 --> 00:48:49.760 align:start position:0%
24 hours if they were arrested on a
 
00:48:52.069 --> 00:48:52.079 align:start position:0%
Thursday night but if they're arrested
 
00:48:54.390 --> 00:48:54.400 align:start position:0%
on a Friday they're going it could be
 
00:48:56.470 --> 00:48:56.480 align:start position:0%
Monday or Tuesday depending on if it's a
 
00:48:58.430 --> 00:48:58.440 align:start position:0%
holiday but they will get the next court
 
00:49:02.270 --> 00:49:02.280 align:start position:0%
date right right okay thank you and just
 
00:49:03.750 --> 00:49:03.760 align:start position:0%
I think what the representative was
 
00:49:06.430 --> 00:49:06.440 align:start position:0%
asking is violent crimes that are the
 
00:49:07.910 --> 00:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
decision is made either by the bail
 
00:49:10.390 --> 00:49:10.400 align:start position:0%
commissioner or by Statute that they're
 
00:49:13.230 --> 00:49:13.240 align:start position:0%
not bailable over the weekend how how
 
00:49:16.510 --> 00:49:16.520 align:start position:0%
often did you see that um in other words
 
00:49:17.829 --> 00:49:17.839 align:start position:0%
how often do you have to feed people
 
00:49:20.789 --> 00:49:20.799 align:start position:0%
over a whole weekend yeah in that that
 
00:49:23.030 --> 00:49:23.040 align:start position:0%
would be a a great question for uh the
 
00:49:25.150 --> 00:49:25.160 align:start position:0%
county jails um because we won't hold
 
00:49:27.349 --> 00:49:27.359 align:start position:0%
them we'll we'll bring them to the
 
00:49:31.990 --> 00:49:32.000 align:start position:0%
county jail um but I can speak for gos
 
00:49:34.630 --> 00:49:34.640 align:start position:0%
town we don't often have anyone that
 
00:49:38.190 --> 00:49:38.200 align:start position:0%
gets held um they're all usually PR bail
 
00:49:40.150 --> 00:49:40.160 align:start position:0%
I I would assume the city would have a
 
00:49:42.870 --> 00:49:42.880 align:start position:0%
lot more um that are being held but I
 
00:49:45.109 --> 00:49:45.119 align:start position:0%
don't know what the numbers are on
 
00:49:49.069 --> 00:49:49.079 align:start position:0%
that so it's really a demographic issue
 
00:49:50.870 --> 00:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
the wherever you have more violent crime
 
00:49:52.910 --> 00:49:52.920 align:start position:0%
you're more likely to have people held
 
00:49:55.309 --> 00:49:55.319 align:start position:0%
at what time in the process that someone
 
00:49:57.750 --> 00:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
is is being held does does they do they
 
00:50:00.069 --> 00:50:00.079 align:start position:0%
get transferred to the county
 
00:50:02.710 --> 00:50:02.720 align:start position:0%
jail we if they're being held we we'll
 
00:50:04.990 --> 00:50:05.000 align:start position:0%
have them at the county jail within an
 
00:50:07.390 --> 00:50:07.400 align:start position:0%
hour or two they're only going to be at
 
00:50:09.309 --> 00:50:09.319 align:start position:0%
the Golf Town Police Department enough
 
00:50:11.829 --> 00:50:11.839 align:start position:0%
to get the booking procedure done and
 
00:50:13.030 --> 00:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
then we're going to drive them over to
 
00:50:15.150 --> 00:50:15.160 align:start position:0%
Valley Street jail in Manchester within
 
00:50:17.670 --> 00:50:17.680 align:start position:0%
I'd say an hour maybe two
 
00:50:21.589 --> 00:50:21.599 align:start position:0%
Max thank you any representative Pratt
 
00:50:23.670 --> 00:50:23.680 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that they would be um go
 
00:50:26.270 --> 00:50:26.280 align:start position:0%
to court the next court day are there
 
00:50:27.630 --> 00:50:27.640 align:start position:0%
holidays for the
 
00:50:30.230 --> 00:50:30.240 align:start position:0%
court the court does have holidays yes
 
00:50:32.829 --> 00:50:32.839 align:start position:0%
the so it might not be Monday no it
 
00:50:35.069 --> 00:50:35.079 align:start position:0%
could be Tuesday if there is a Monday
 
00:50:37.870 --> 00:50:37.880 align:start position:0%
holiday okay that's it thank you
 
00:50:42.670 --> 00:50:42.680 align:start position:0%
yeah um back to the the technology just
 
00:50:46.069 --> 00:50:46.079 align:start position:0%
real quick does and I'll ask you to put
 
00:50:47.870 --> 00:50:47.880 align:start position:0%
on your Chiefs of police I know that
 
00:50:49.390 --> 00:50:49.400 align:start position:0%
you're just kind of loosely representing
 
00:50:52.109 --> 00:50:52.119 align:start position:0%
him today but do you see value in
 
00:50:53.870 --> 00:50:53.880 align:start position:0%
ensuring that every Police Department in
 
00:50:56.470 --> 00:50:56.480 align:start position:0%
the state has a connection to check
 
00:50:59.470 --> 00:50:59.480 align:start position:0%
records in want and warrant yes it would
 
00:50:59.480 --> 00:51:01.630 align:start position:0%
records in want and warrant yes it would
be

00:51:01.630 --> 00:51:01.640 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:51:04.710 --> 00:51:04.720 align:start position:0%
um it it's really really helpful to have
 
00:51:08.430 --> 00:51:08.440 align:start position:0%
a cross agency check and that is not
 
00:51:11.150 --> 00:51:11.160 align:start position:0%
running a a criminal record but you
 
00:51:12.950 --> 00:51:12.960 align:start position:0%
could run you know we have an internal
 
00:51:15.549 --> 00:51:15.559 align:start position:0%
system so if they're in gown we run them
 
00:51:17.190 --> 00:51:17.200 align:start position:0%
we may see that oh they were just
 
00:51:20.230 --> 00:51:20.240 align:start position:0%
arrested last night um or we were just
 
00:51:23.349 --> 00:51:23.359 align:start position:0%
there for um a domestic situation where
 
00:51:24.829 --> 00:51:24.839 align:start position:0%
there was an arrest but I can see that
 
00:51:27.109 --> 00:51:27.119 align:start position:0%
there was a report from yesterday
 
00:51:28.670 --> 00:51:28.680 align:start position:0%
Manchester won't see that because it's
 
00:51:31.789 --> 00:51:31.799 align:start position:0%
only in our system nsha State Police
 
00:51:33.150 --> 00:51:33.160 align:start position:0%
they won't see that because it's only in
 
00:51:35.710 --> 00:51:35.720 align:start position:0%
our system if there was a way to cross
 
00:51:37.750 --> 00:51:37.760 align:start position:0%
agency check everything that would be
 
00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:39.190 align:start position:0%
agency check everything that would be
extremely

00:51:39.190 --> 00:51:39.200 align:start position:0%
extremely
 
00:51:43.430 --> 00:51:43.440 align:start position:0%
helpful and if you know um just for the
 
00:51:45.829 --> 00:51:45.839 align:start position:0%
committee correct me if I'm wrong most
 
00:51:47.990 --> 00:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
of our surrounding states have this and
 
00:51:50.069 --> 00:51:50.079 align:start position:0%
have had it for decades is is that not
 
00:51:52.670 --> 00:51:52.680 align:start position:0%
your understanding as well I I can't
 
00:51:55.150 --> 00:51:55.160 align:start position:0%
speak to that I don't know that's fine
 
00:51:55.160 --> 00:51:56.670 align:start position:0%
speak to that I don't know that's fine
um

00:51:56.670 --> 00:51:56.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:58.030 --> 00:51:58.040 align:start position:0%
is there anything else you'd like the
 
00:52:00.150 --> 00:52:00.160 align:start position:0%
committee to know while you're
 
00:52:03.230 --> 00:52:03.240 align:start position:0%
here no okay any further questions
 
00:52:05.190 --> 00:52:05.200 align:start position:0%
before we let know no thank you for your
 
00:52:08.829 --> 00:52:08.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:11.150 --> 00:52:11.160 align:start position:0%
you I just have a comment for you Mr
 
00:52:13.270 --> 00:52:13.280 align:start position:0%
chair if I could yes go ahead so I'm
 
00:52:16.109 --> 00:52:16.119 align:start position:0%
just wondering if before we make a firm
 
00:52:19.030 --> 00:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
decision on what in this list we include
 
00:52:21.069 --> 00:52:21.079 align:start position:0%
if we could hear from the public
 
00:52:23.390 --> 00:52:23.400 align:start position:0%
defenders and victims first just so we
 
00:52:26.230 --> 00:52:26.240 align:start position:0%
make it clear what the effects of a
 
00:52:27.789 --> 00:52:27.799 align:start position:0%
crime like stalking even if it is a
 
00:52:29.510 --> 00:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor or something or the other
 
00:52:32.349 --> 00:52:32.359 align:start position:0%
would be on somebody uh whether they're
 
00:52:34.349 --> 00:52:34.359 align:start position:0%
being charged with it or if it's a
 
00:52:36.390 --> 00:52:36.400 align:start position:0%
victim of one of those crimes yeah
 
00:52:38.670 --> 00:52:38.680 align:start position:0%
that's that's um that is my intent I
 
00:52:40.750 --> 00:52:40.760 align:start position:0%
have invited the um domestic violence
 
00:52:42.710 --> 00:52:42.720 align:start position:0%
Coalition and the public defender office
 
00:52:46.230 --> 00:52:46.240 align:start position:0%
to come in um it's my intent that we
 
00:52:48.109 --> 00:52:48.119 align:start position:0%
don't vote on anything firmly until
 
00:52:50.150 --> 00:52:50.160 align:start position:0%
we're just about finished um we're going
 
00:52:51.990 --> 00:52:52.000 align:start position:0%
to have informal votes so we kind of
 
00:52:53.670 --> 00:52:53.680 align:start position:0%
don't have any surprises when we start
 
00:52:56.870 --> 00:52:56.880 align:start position:0%
putting this package together um so uh I
 
00:52:58.670 --> 00:52:58.680 align:start position:0%
want to have every possible bit of
 
00:53:00.270 --> 00:53:00.280 align:start position:0%
knowledge that we can get before we make
 
00:53:02.349 --> 00:53:02.359 align:start position:0%
a final vote on anything I appreciate
 
00:53:05.390 --> 00:53:05.400 align:start position:0%
that but I think the committee um some
 
00:53:07.589 --> 00:53:07.599 align:start position:0%
of us may be shocked by the fact that
 
00:53:09.430 --> 00:53:09.440 align:start position:0%
where we are technology-wise in this
 
00:53:11.710 --> 00:53:11.720 align:start position:0%
state we make a lot of assumptions based
 
00:53:14.309 --> 00:53:14.319 align:start position:0%
on what we watch on TV and you some of
 
00:53:18.630 --> 00:53:18.640 align:start position:0%
us sadly aren't shocked but um it it's
 
00:53:21.190 --> 00:53:21.200 align:start position:0%
not that way um it should be but it's
 
00:53:23.230 --> 00:53:23.240 align:start position:0%
not um you know you see on television
 
00:53:24.430 --> 00:53:24.440 align:start position:0%
someone getting picked up and they're in
 
00:53:26.549 --> 00:53:26.559 align:start position:0%
their car doing a quick and they know
 
00:53:29.630 --> 00:53:29.640 align:start position:0%
the guy's you know credit history here
 
00:53:31.750 --> 00:53:31.760 align:start position:0%
our officers are asked to and our bail
 
00:53:34.069 --> 00:53:34.079 align:start position:0%
Commissioners frankly to make
 
00:53:36.430 --> 00:53:36.440 align:start position:0%
decisions based on no information and
 
00:53:38.030 --> 00:53:38.040 align:start position:0%
other that's what sits in front of them
 
00:53:40.150 --> 00:53:40.160 align:start position:0%
right then and whether or not that's
 
00:53:42.589 --> 00:53:42.599 align:start position:0%
true um you know that's anyone's guess
 
00:53:44.910 --> 00:53:44.920 align:start position:0%
they ask are you out on bail well maybe
 
00:53:47.150 --> 00:53:47.160 align:start position:0%
the guy will say yes and maybe he won't
 
00:53:49.789 --> 00:53:49.799 align:start position:0%
um we heard before from the state police
 
00:53:51.549 --> 00:53:51.559 align:start position:0%
that they would often find out someone
 
00:53:53.349 --> 00:53:53.359 align:start position:0%
was on bail because when they were
 
00:53:55.630 --> 00:53:55.640 align:start position:0%
arrested and inventory of the car they
 
00:53:58.270 --> 00:53:58.280 align:start position:0%
found bail slips in the in the in the
 
00:54:00.710 --> 00:54:00.720 align:start position:0%
car so um I don't think that's a way to
 
00:54:03.390 --> 00:54:03.400 align:start position:0%
run a criminal justice system and I hope
 
00:54:06.870 --> 00:54:06.880 align:start position:0%
everyone agrees um representative GA
 
00:54:12.390 --> 00:54:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:14.870 --> 00:54:14.880 align:start position:0%
me officer would you mind taking the um
 
00:54:17.349 --> 00:54:17.359 align:start position:0%
one more time for a moment and I saw you
 
00:54:19.430 --> 00:54:19.440 align:start position:0%
uh Professor sheer would you mind we
 
00:54:24.069 --> 00:54:24.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:24.079 --> 00:54:27.349 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:54:27.349 --> 00:54:27.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:29.150 --> 00:54:29.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question I you
 
00:54:31.589 --> 00:54:31.599 align:start position:0%
know I just want to make sure that I
 
00:54:33.549 --> 00:54:33.559 align:start position:0%
truly understand stood what you said
 
00:54:36.030 --> 00:54:36.040 align:start position:0%
when you talked in terms of you have
 
00:54:39.349 --> 00:54:39.359 align:start position:0%
access to a judge um under certain
 
00:54:41.230 --> 00:54:41.240 align:start position:0%
circumstances is that correct that's
 
00:54:44.150 --> 00:54:44.160 align:start position:0%
correct okay so if someone's arrested
 
00:54:47.670 --> 00:54:47.680 align:start position:0%
and the bail people Commissioners say um
 
00:54:49.549 --> 00:54:49.559 align:start position:0%
we're going to bail them but you don't
 
00:54:53.309 --> 00:54:53.319 align:start position:0%
feel they should be bailed you can call
 
00:54:55.789 --> 00:54:55.799 align:start position:0%
on call judge no we canot call Judge for
 
00:54:58.670 --> 00:54:58.680 align:start position:0%
that okay so if it's a bail issue you
 
00:55:01.510 --> 00:55:01.520 align:start position:0%
can't no but anything else you could not
 
00:55:04.069 --> 00:55:04.079 align:start position:0%
anything else it's it's really strictly
 
00:55:06.990 --> 00:55:07.000 align:start position:0%
for emergency situations where warrants
 
00:55:08.870 --> 00:55:08.880 align:start position:0%
warrants search warrants arrest warrants
 
00:55:11.510 --> 00:55:11.520 align:start position:0%
emergency protection orders okay thank
 
00:55:12.750 --> 00:55:12.760 align:start position:0%
you very
 
00:55:16.789 --> 00:55:16.799 align:start position:0%
much along that that just gave me um an
 
00:55:19.670 --> 00:55:19.680 align:start position:0%
idea also would there be any value in
 
00:55:21.270 --> 00:55:21.280 align:start position:0%
giving the police the opportunity to
 
00:55:24.190 --> 00:55:24.200 align:start position:0%
appeal a bail commissioner's decision if
 
00:55:27.670 --> 00:55:27.680 align:start position:0%
say um on a Thursday somebody was
 
00:55:29.910 --> 00:55:29.920 align:start position:0%
arrested no make it a Friday someone's
 
00:55:31.549 --> 00:55:31.559 align:start position:0%
arrested the bail commissioner say I
 
00:55:33.589 --> 00:55:33.599 align:start position:0%
think I'm going to let him go and based
 
00:55:35.230 --> 00:55:35.240 align:start position:0%
on your experience with this particular
 
00:55:36.710 --> 00:55:36.720 align:start position:0%
individual that the bail commissioner
 
00:55:38.349 --> 00:55:38.359 align:start position:0%
might not be aware of or the background
 
00:55:40.309 --> 00:55:40.319 align:start position:0%
situation you think you know gez I'm
 
00:55:41.430 --> 00:55:41.440 align:start position:0%
just not going to feel good tonight
 
00:55:43.430 --> 00:55:43.440 align:start position:0%
letting this guy go would there be any
 
00:55:45.150 --> 00:55:45.160 align:start position:0%
value in allowing you to appeal it to a
 
00:55:47.270 --> 00:55:47.280 align:start position:0%
judge there there would be because the
 
00:55:49.430 --> 00:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
only Avenue that we would have at that
 
00:55:51.789 --> 00:55:51.799 align:start position:0%
point the state would have is the bail
 
00:55:54.990 --> 00:55:55.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner leasum you know prosecutor
 
00:55:56.870 --> 00:55:56.880 align:start position:0%
police don't you know they have some
 
00:55:58.230 --> 00:55:58.240 align:start position:0%
circumstance they don't believe that
 
00:55:59.910 --> 00:55:59.920 align:start position:0%
we'd have to file a motion to have a
 
00:56:03.750 --> 00:56:03.760 align:start position:0%
bail hearing and it could be a week it
 
00:56:05.150 --> 00:56:05.160 align:start position:0%
could be two weeks it could be three
 
00:56:07.510 --> 00:56:07.520 align:start position:0%
weeks that it gets scheduled because the
 
00:56:10.670 --> 00:56:10.680 align:start position:0%
priority isn't for um non-incarcerated
 
00:56:13.950 --> 00:56:13.960 align:start position:0%
um defendants if he's not incarcerated
 
00:56:15.349 --> 00:56:15.359 align:start position:0%
the court is not going to schedule that
 
00:56:17.309 --> 00:56:17.319 align:start position:0%
the next day that's the only way they're
 
00:56:18.829 --> 00:56:18.839 align:start position:0%
going to schedule the next day if he's
 
00:56:21.589 --> 00:56:21.599 align:start position:0%
incarcerated so if he's not incarcerated
 
00:56:23.029 --> 00:56:23.039 align:start position:0%
you're looking at weeks before you get
 
00:56:25.150 --> 00:56:25.160 align:start position:0%
in front of there to address your
 
00:56:27.670 --> 00:56:27.680 align:start position:0%
concern so he's he or she is out for a
 
00:56:29.430 --> 00:56:29.440 align:start position:0%
couple weeks it could be three it could
 
00:56:31.510 --> 00:56:31.520 align:start position:0%
be almost a month at some points if the
 
00:56:33.510 --> 00:56:33.520 align:start position:0%
judge if there's no judge time or that
 
00:56:35.390 --> 00:56:35.400 align:start position:0%
you know you're in a court that you know
 
00:56:37.589 --> 00:56:37.599 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a judge every day and
 
00:56:39.349 --> 00:56:39.359 align:start position:0%
that's kind of gambling because you know
 
00:56:40.789 --> 00:56:40.799 align:start position:0%
either he's going to do something or
 
00:56:43.910 --> 00:56:43.920 align:start position:0%
he's not in that time period right right
 
00:56:48.109 --> 00:56:48.119 align:start position:0%
um okay often times when we see uh bail
 
00:56:50.710 --> 00:56:50.720 align:start position:0%
being violated it's
 
00:56:54.349 --> 00:56:54.359 align:start position:0%
fairly um close to the time that they're
 
00:56:54.359 --> 00:56:55.789 align:start position:0%
fairly um close to the time that they're
released

00:56:55.789 --> 00:56:55.799 align:start position:0%
released
 
00:56:58.230 --> 00:56:58.240 align:start position:0%
the the time right after a domestic a
 
00:57:00.390 --> 00:57:00.400 align:start position:0%
time you know that they're
 
00:57:03.510 --> 00:57:03.520 align:start position:0%
usually um it's those days after it that
 
00:57:06.430 --> 00:57:06.440 align:start position:0%
that we see that they're violating the
 
00:57:09.710 --> 00:57:09.720 align:start position:0%
contact thank you any other
 
00:57:21.549 --> 00:57:21.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:25.109 --> 00:57:25.119 align:start position:0%
Sher thank thank you I'll be uh really
 
00:57:29.069 --> 00:57:29.079 align:start position:0%
brief uh one uh I was just talking to uh
 
00:57:31.589 --> 00:57:31.599 align:start position:0%
one of the baill Commissioners uh they
 
00:57:33.870 --> 00:57:33.880 align:start position:0%
don't put the court order in the the the
 
00:57:37.230 --> 00:57:37.240 align:start position:0%
bail order in the mail what happens is
 
00:57:40.470 --> 00:57:40.480 align:start position:0%
once the bail order gets signed they fax
 
00:57:46.309 --> 00:57:46.319 align:start position:0%
it to the court um so it's it's not as
 
00:57:50.349 --> 00:57:50.359 align:start position:0%
uh it there's it's not as long a period
 
00:57:52.190 --> 00:57:52.200 align:start position:0%
between the time the bail order is
 
00:57:54.069 --> 00:57:54.079 align:start position:0%
issued by the bail commissioner and the
 
00:57:56.190 --> 00:57:56.200 align:start position:0%
time it gets the cour court it's my
 
00:57:57.789 --> 00:57:57.799 align:start position:0%
understanding I had heard that um some
 
00:57:59.190 --> 00:57:59.200 align:start position:0%
bail Commissioners don't have fax
 
00:58:03.430 --> 00:58:03.440 align:start position:0%
machines um so yeah um and and and maybe
 
00:58:04.670 --> 00:58:04.680 align:start position:0%
I'll hear for some I'll hear from the
 
00:58:06.029 --> 00:58:06.039 align:start position:0%
bail commission
 
00:58:09.069 --> 00:58:09.079 align:start position:0%
um the the hard topic is domestic
 
00:58:12.190 --> 00:58:12.200 align:start position:0%
violence issue and bail and and you know
 
00:58:15.069 --> 00:58:15.079 align:start position:0%
I fully appreciate having known
 
00:58:17.950 --> 00:58:17.960 align:start position:0%
personally people who've been victims of
 
00:58:20.910 --> 00:58:20.920 align:start position:0%
domestic violence uh about what I would
 
00:58:23.150 --> 00:58:23.160 align:start position:0%
call the scorge of domestic
 
00:58:26.069 --> 00:58:26.079 align:start position:0%
violence um
 
00:58:27.589 --> 00:58:27.599 align:start position:0%
as with
 
00:58:31.309 --> 00:58:31.319 align:start position:0%
addiction um and mental health issues
 
00:58:34.430 --> 00:58:34.440 align:start position:0%
it's really dangerous to try and use the
 
00:58:36.549 --> 00:58:36.559 align:start position:0%
bail system not the whole criminal legal
 
00:58:39.910 --> 00:58:39.920 align:start position:0%
system but the bail system to sort out
 
00:58:44.230 --> 00:58:44.240 align:start position:0%
too much about domestic violence um the
 
00:58:49.390 --> 00:58:49.400 align:start position:0%
perfect example is this whether um
 
00:58:51.829 --> 00:58:51.839 align:start position:0%
whether you hold a person even on a
 
00:58:55.029 --> 00:58:55.039 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor domestic violence uh for up
 
00:58:59.510 --> 00:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
to 24 hours or you hold them for 4 days
 
00:59:01.710 --> 00:59:01.720 align:start position:0%
uh my understanding in talking to any
 
00:59:04.349 --> 00:59:04.359 align:start position:0%
number of people they're not going to be
 
00:59:07.309 --> 00:59:07.319 align:start position:0%
any more cooled down uh when they get
 
00:59:10.309 --> 00:59:10.319 align:start position:0%
out of jail after that hold than they
 
00:59:13.870 --> 00:59:13.880 align:start position:0%
would be if they get out on PR bail um
 
00:59:15.390 --> 00:59:15.400 align:start position:0%
and you
 
00:59:18.270 --> 00:59:18.280 align:start position:0%
know it that's easy for me to say I
 
00:59:20.309 --> 00:59:20.319 align:start position:0%
think it's actually quite true but I
 
00:59:24.230 --> 00:59:24.240 align:start position:0%
don't know what the answer is um but uh
 
00:59:25.190 --> 00:59:25.200 align:start position:0%
I just
 
00:59:27.270 --> 00:59:27.280 align:start position:0%
caution the committee
 
00:59:31.750 --> 00:59:31.760 align:start position:0%
in feeling they can address the issue of
 
00:59:34.710 --> 00:59:34.720 align:start position:0%
people who are charged with domestic
 
00:59:37.150 --> 00:59:37.160 align:start position:0%
violence and once they get out either
 
00:59:40.549 --> 00:59:40.559 align:start position:0%
immediately on PR Baal or 24 hours later
 
00:59:43.190 --> 00:59:43.200 align:start position:0%
uh after seeing a judge or four days
 
00:59:48.309 --> 00:59:48.319 align:start position:0%
later um uh that the likelihood of them
 
00:59:50.430 --> 00:59:50.440 align:start position:0%
violating a protective order or going
 
00:59:55.150 --> 00:59:55.160 align:start position:0%
back uh to where they were and and uh um
 
00:59:58.309 --> 00:59:58.319 align:start position:0%
becoming involved in negative ways with
 
01:00:01.829 --> 01:00:01.839 align:start position:0%
uh uh the the victim um it's still
 
01:00:03.670 --> 01:00:03.680 align:start position:0%
pretty high
 
01:00:07.150 --> 01:00:07.160 align:start position:0%
so um I don't have a neat and tidy
 
01:00:08.829 --> 01:00:08.839 align:start position:0%
answer you know the the neat and tidy
 
01:00:11.829 --> 01:00:11.839 align:start position:0%
answer is one that we can't do it's like
 
01:00:14.190 --> 01:00:14.200 align:start position:0%
we can't hold everybody who's charged
 
01:00:15.870 --> 01:00:15.880 align:start position:0%
with misdemeanor or felony domestic
 
01:00:17.670 --> 01:00:17.680 align:start position:0%
violence until they have a trial you
 
01:00:20.670 --> 01:00:20.680 align:start position:0%
know I me that's not realistic uh I
 
01:00:23.630 --> 01:00:23.640 align:start position:0%
don't I wish I could offer the committee
 
01:00:28.270 --> 01:00:28.280 align:start position:0%
an answer but I I caution you uh about
 
01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:30.510 align:start position:0%
an answer but I I caution you uh about
thinking

01:00:30.510 --> 01:00:30.520 align:start position:0%
thinking
 
01:00:33.829 --> 01:00:33.839 align:start position:0%
that the bail system as it is or making
 
01:00:36.309 --> 01:00:36.319 align:start position:0%
changes in the bail system is going to
 
01:00:39.670 --> 01:00:39.680 align:start position:0%
deal in a in a realistic way with the
 
01:00:42.150 --> 01:00:42.160 align:start position:0%
substance of this problem that's a
 
01:00:46.190 --> 01:00:46.200 align:start position:0%
depressing thing to say but um uh last
 
01:00:49.910 --> 01:00:49.920 align:start position:0%
um oh second to last
 
01:00:52.430 --> 01:00:52.440 align:start position:0%
uh the difference between calling up a
 
01:00:53.750 --> 01:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
judge and getting a search warrant or
 
01:00:55.910 --> 01:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
going to a judge's house knocking on the
 
01:00:58.470 --> 01:00:58.480 align:start position:0%
door at 6:00 in the morning after
 
01:01:00.549 --> 01:01:00.559 align:start position:0%
alerting the judge and getting the judge
 
01:01:02.150 --> 01:01:02.160 align:start position:0%
to sign a search warrant because you
 
01:01:05.309 --> 01:01:05.319 align:start position:0%
need it on the weekend uh and uh having
 
01:01:07.750 --> 01:01:07.760 align:start position:0%
a bail hearing is at a bail hearing
 
01:01:09.430 --> 01:01:09.440 align:start position:0%
you're going to need to have
 
01:01:14.349 --> 01:01:14.359 align:start position:0%
counsel um and and uh uh with all that
 
01:01:15.589 --> 01:01:15.599 align:start position:0%
comes with a you know particularly if
 
01:01:16.950 --> 01:01:16.960 align:start position:0%
it's a bail hearing where you're looking
 
01:01:18.710 --> 01:01:18.720 align:start position:0%
to detain somebody without bail you're
 
01:01:21.430 --> 01:01:21.440 align:start position:0%
going to have to have you it's a
 
01:01:23.990 --> 01:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
significant event that can't be done in
 
01:01:26.829 --> 01:01:26.839 align:start position:0%
the same way that uh getting a search
 
01:01:30.789 --> 01:01:30.799 align:start position:0%
warrant sign can be done that said yes
 
01:01:34.069 --> 01:01:34.079 align:start position:0%
judges sometimes do weekend Duty you
 
01:01:36.950 --> 01:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
know I I've talked to judges who
 
01:01:40.309 --> 01:01:40.319 align:start position:0%
particularly in more busy uh areas
 
01:01:42.829 --> 01:01:42.839 align:start position:0%
counties in the state where they they
 
01:01:45.029 --> 01:01:45.039 align:start position:0%
frequently are signing warrant the
 
01:01:46.510 --> 01:01:46.520 align:start position:0%
police are coming to their house to get
 
01:01:49.390 --> 01:01:49.400 align:start position:0%
them to sign a warrant or
 
01:01:54.510 --> 01:01:54.520 align:start position:0%
uh more in so-called modern times um
 
01:01:56.789 --> 01:01:56.799 align:start position:0%
significantly after I finished
 
01:01:58.789 --> 01:01:58.799 align:start position:0%
practicing um they can do it
 
01:02:02.710 --> 01:02:02.720 align:start position:0%
electronically but um it's uh judges
 
01:02:04.109 --> 01:02:04.119 align:start position:0%
work on the
 
01:02:06.390 --> 01:02:06.400 align:start position:0%
weekends but they haven't been doing
 
01:02:08.470 --> 01:02:08.480 align:start position:0%
things as significant as bail
 
01:02:10.630 --> 01:02:10.640 align:start position:0%
hearings uh quick question before you go
 
01:02:14.230 --> 01:02:14.240 align:start position:0%
to your next um from a constitutional
 
01:02:18.069 --> 01:02:18.079 align:start position:0%
perspective if if someone's arrested and
 
01:02:19.470 --> 01:02:19.480 align:start position:0%
you have a bail
 
01:02:22.430 --> 01:02:22.440 align:start position:0%
commissioner um making a decision with
 
01:02:25.069 --> 01:02:25.079 align:start position:0%
in a non-adversarial uh
 
01:02:27.750 --> 01:02:27.760 align:start position:0%
type of situation why could a judge not
 
01:02:31.309 --> 01:02:31.319 align:start position:0%
do the same thing in in replace assume
 
01:02:32.990 --> 01:02:33.000 align:start position:0%
we had no bail Commissioners and only
 
01:02:35.349 --> 01:02:35.359 align:start position:0%
judges made that quick decision
 
01:02:38.510 --> 01:02:38.520 align:start position:0%
regarding bail why would you need to
 
01:02:41.670 --> 01:02:41.680 align:start position:0%
have a full hearing with a full panoply
 
01:02:43.670 --> 01:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
of of all the the
 
01:02:46.549 --> 01:02:46.559 align:start position:0%
actors and and make it an adversarial
 
01:02:48.910 --> 01:02:48.920 align:start position:0%
versus where the commissioner does is it
 
01:02:52.630 --> 01:02:52.640 align:start position:0%
just by virtue of their office uh no I
 
01:02:55.630 --> 01:02:55.640 align:start position:0%
no um
 
01:02:57.190 --> 01:02:57.200 align:start position:0%
when you're seeing a
 
01:03:01.029 --> 01:03:01.039 align:start position:0%
judge about bail the judge is setting
 
01:03:05.870 --> 01:03:05.880 align:start position:0%
bail for the entire time up to the trial
 
01:03:08.470 --> 01:03:08.480 align:start position:0%
occurring so potentially somebody can be
 
01:03:10.430 --> 01:03:10.440 align:start position:0%
held if if if they're seeking to hold
 
01:03:15.230 --> 01:03:15.240 align:start position:0%
somebody without bail um uh the
 
01:03:17.630 --> 01:03:17.640 align:start position:0%
significance of how long somebody can be
 
01:03:20.430 --> 01:03:20.440 align:start position:0%
held the the significance of the dep the
 
01:03:22.950 --> 01:03:22.960 align:start position:0%
extent of the deprivation of Liberty is
 
01:03:25.549 --> 01:03:25.559 align:start position:0%
such that you're entitled to to that
 
01:03:28.069 --> 01:03:28.079 align:start position:0%
array of due process rights clear and
 
01:03:30.630 --> 01:03:30.640 align:start position:0%
convincing evidence standard uh counsel
 
01:03:32.349 --> 01:03:32.359 align:start position:0%
the right to call witnesses to cross
 
01:03:34.349 --> 01:03:34.359 align:start position:0%
examine you know that's that's
 
01:03:36.150 --> 01:03:36.160 align:start position:0%
constitutionally a case called us versus
 
01:03:39.230 --> 01:03:39.240 align:start position:0%
solo has laid that down when somebody is
 
01:03:41.190 --> 01:03:41.200 align:start position:0%
seeing a bail commissioner who has the
 
01:03:44.470 --> 01:03:44.480 align:start position:0%
power to detain somebody without
 
01:03:47.470 --> 01:03:47.480 align:start position:0%
bail but even under the system as it is
 
01:03:49.990 --> 01:03:50.000 align:start position:0%
it can't be any longer than you know
 
01:03:53.150 --> 01:03:53.160 align:start position:0%
right now the system can be as long as 4
 
01:03:56.630 --> 01:03:56.640 align:start position:0%
days uh um that's a shorter period of
 
01:03:58.549 --> 01:03:58.559 align:start position:0%
time the long you know the the extent to
 
01:04:00.510 --> 01:04:00.520 align:start position:0%
which you get Beyond 4 days you start to
 
01:04:03.750 --> 01:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
run into constitutional uh problems the
 
01:04:05.750 --> 01:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
the extent to which the deprivation of
 
01:04:08.510 --> 01:04:08.520 align:start position:0%
Liberty gets longer than that
 
01:04:11.750 --> 01:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
constitutionally you start to run into
 
01:04:15.870 --> 01:04:15.880 align:start position:0%
let's call them solerno problems um so a
 
01:04:17.829 --> 01:04:17.839 align:start position:0%
bail commissioner is only deciding to
 
01:04:22.309 --> 01:04:22.319 align:start position:0%
hold them until they see a judge uh a
 
01:04:24.870 --> 01:04:24.880 align:start position:0%
judge is deciding to hold them
 
01:04:27.950 --> 01:04:27.960 align:start position:0%
until trial a big difference between
 
01:04:29.710 --> 01:04:29.720 align:start position:0%
deprivation of Liberty and those two
 
01:04:34.470 --> 01:04:34.480 align:start position:0%
could we not craft a statute that said a
 
01:04:37.750 --> 01:04:37.760 align:start position:0%
judge on a weekend hearing can only
 
01:04:40.670 --> 01:04:40.680 align:start position:0%
decide and this would be a dangerousness
 
01:04:43.789 --> 01:04:43.799 align:start position:0%
Flight Risk hearing or decision only
 
01:04:45.829 --> 01:04:45.839 align:start position:0%
until the next court business day where
 
01:04:47.349 --> 01:04:47.359 align:start position:0%
they would be entitled to their full
 
01:04:49.549 --> 01:04:49.559 align:start position:0%
solo hearing
 
01:04:53.710 --> 01:04:53.720 align:start position:0%
uh to be a little too cute I don't want
 
01:04:54.829 --> 01:04:54.839 align:start position:0%
you to tell me if the court would like
 
01:04:56.630 --> 01:04:56.640 align:start position:0%
that or not I just no no no no I'm not
 
01:04:57.950 --> 01:04:57.960 align:start position:0%
going to say that's essentially what the
 
01:04:59.950 --> 01:04:59.960 align:start position:0%
system is
 
01:05:02.789 --> 01:05:02.799 align:start position:0%
now but we have a a Commissioners doing
 
01:05:04.309 --> 01:05:04.319 align:start position:0%
it and holding them till they can get to
 
01:05:07.029 --> 01:05:07.039 align:start position:0%
court changing it to a judge to hold
 
01:05:10.750 --> 01:05:10.760 align:start position:0%
them until they get to court uh six to
 
01:05:12.750 --> 01:05:12.760 align:start position:0%
one half dozen of the other it it's the
 
01:05:12.760 --> 01:05:14.190 align:start position:0%
one half dozen of the other it it's the
same

01:05:14.190 --> 01:05:14.200 align:start position:0%
same
 
01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:16.470 align:start position:0%
same
thing

01:05:16.470 --> 01:05:16.480 align:start position:0%
thing
 
01:05:18.549 --> 01:05:18.559 align:start position:0%
um what was your next
 
01:05:22.069 --> 01:05:22.079 align:start position:0%
Point um
 
01:05:24.549 --> 01:05:24.559 align:start position:0%
actually I'm sorry I didn't see you and
 
01:05:28.150 --> 01:05:28.160 align:start position:0%
Stu thank you Mr chair I guess my
 
01:05:30.829 --> 01:05:30.839 align:start position:0%
question to you is do you think it would
 
01:05:32.710 --> 01:05:32.720 align:start position:0%
be beneficial for more information to be
 
01:05:34.549 --> 01:05:34.559 align:start position:0%
available to a bill
 
01:05:36.230 --> 01:05:36.240 align:start position:0%
commissioner with the facts and
 
01:05:38.470 --> 01:05:38.480 align:start position:0%
circumstances of individual cases when
 
01:05:40.269 --> 01:05:40.279 align:start position:0%
it comes to weighing out Public Safety
 
01:05:40.279 --> 01:05:41.230 align:start position:0%
it comes to weighing out Public Safety
versus

01:05:41.230 --> 01:05:41.240 align:start position:0%
versus
 
01:05:44.230 --> 01:05:44.240 align:start position:0%
Liberty you know I I think it depends on
 
01:05:47.390 --> 01:05:47.400 align:start position:0%
the uh uh the jurisdiction the chief you
 
01:05:49.109 --> 01:05:49.119 align:start position:0%
heard from is is
 
01:05:52.269 --> 01:05:52.279 align:start position:0%
gtwn um uh you know I
 
01:05:56.789 --> 01:05:56.799 align:start position:0%
think it varies tremendously from Police
 
01:05:59.150 --> 01:05:59.160 align:start position:0%
Department to police department and bail
 
01:06:03.309 --> 01:06:03.319 align:start position:0%
commissioner and at how much information
 
01:06:05.829 --> 01:06:05.839 align:start position:0%
they have you know sometimes the police
 
01:06:08.829 --> 01:06:08.839 align:start position:0%
are arresting somebody who they know you
 
01:06:11.710 --> 01:06:11.720 align:start position:0%
know and it's not unusual and and they
 
01:06:13.710 --> 01:06:13.720 align:start position:0%
have tons of information you know that's
 
01:06:15.589 --> 01:06:15.599 align:start position:0%
the ca I know that's very frequently the
 
01:06:20.549 --> 01:06:20.559 align:start position:0%
case in Portsmouth um um other times in
 
01:06:22.150 --> 01:06:22.160 align:start position:0%
the bigger police departments they have
 
01:06:24.789 --> 01:06:24.799 align:start position:0%
easy access to more information
 
01:06:28.549 --> 01:06:28.559 align:start position:0%
I don't uh
 
01:06:33.230 --> 01:06:33.240 align:start position:0%
um it's always good for anyone who's
 
01:06:35.470 --> 01:06:35.480 align:start position:0%
making a decision about depriving
 
01:06:37.230 --> 01:06:37.240 align:start position:0%
somebody of their Liberty to have as
 
01:06:39.789 --> 01:06:39.799 align:start position:0%
much information or and prot making a
 
01:06:41.430 --> 01:06:41.440 align:start position:0%
decision whether to deprive someone of
 
01:06:44.309 --> 01:06:44.319 align:start position:0%
Liberty and protect their Public Safety
 
01:06:46.870 --> 01:06:46.880 align:start position:0%
or not to have as much information as
 
01:06:49.910 --> 01:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
possible um uh I think as the chair has
 
01:06:52.829 --> 01:06:52.839 align:start position:0%
made clear you know I too am a very
 
01:06:55.470 --> 01:06:55.480 align:start position:0%
strong advocate of improving the
 
01:06:57.390 --> 01:06:57.400 align:start position:0%
communication and the access to
 
01:06:59.670 --> 01:06:59.680 align:start position:0%
information uh in the state because I
 
01:07:04.029 --> 01:07:04.039 align:start position:0%
think that'll make a big difference for
 
01:07:08.109 --> 01:07:08.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:11.269 --> 01:07:11.279 align:start position:0%
you again from a from a constitutional
 
01:07:13.990 --> 01:07:14.000 align:start position:0%
perspective is there less of an issue
 
01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:14.950 align:start position:0%
perspective is there less of an issue
with

01:07:14.950 --> 01:07:14.960 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:07:19.589 --> 01:07:19.599 align:start position:0%
including um domestic violence uh in a
 
01:07:22.230 --> 01:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
list of crimes like this if we're only
 
01:07:25.349 --> 01:07:25.359 align:start position:0%
talking about 24 hours or less to hear
 
01:07:28.789 --> 01:07:28.799 align:start position:0%
to to see a judge versus more than 24
 
01:07:33.109 --> 01:07:33.119 align:start position:0%
hours or are there other reasons why um
 
01:07:35.750 --> 01:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
from a constitutional perspective it's a
 
01:07:40.510 --> 01:07:40.520 align:start position:0%
good idea to to not include a crime like
 
01:07:42.829 --> 01:07:42.839 align:start position:0%
that in this
 
01:07:48.190 --> 01:07:48.200 align:start position:0%
list I think if somebody who ail who is
 
01:07:50.789 --> 01:07:50.799 align:start position:0%
included on this list and therefore
 
01:07:53.430 --> 01:07:53.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't see a bail commissioner and they
 
01:08:00.190 --> 01:08:00.200 align:start position:0%
wait to to see a judge um I think yes uh
 
01:08:02.029 --> 01:08:02.039 align:start position:0%
I would have
 
01:08:05.710 --> 01:08:05.720 align:start position:0%
some different feelings about what's on
 
01:08:09.069 --> 01:08:09.079 align:start position:0%
the list now as to domestic violence you
 
01:08:11.430 --> 01:08:11.440 align:start position:0%
know I go back to what I said earlier if
 
01:08:15.109 --> 01:08:15.119 align:start position:0%
if you hold somebody uh for uh 24 hours
 
01:08:16.990 --> 01:08:17.000 align:start position:0%
who's charged with even a misdemeanor
 
01:08:19.349 --> 01:08:19.359 align:start position:0%
domestic violence yeah I just don't in
 
01:08:23.390 --> 01:08:23.400 align:start position:0%
terms of them going back and and causing
 
01:08:25.870 --> 01:08:25.880 align:start position:0%
trouble with their victim uh I just
 
01:08:27.829 --> 01:08:27.839 align:start position:0%
don't think holding them for 24 hours is
 
01:08:30.950 --> 01:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
really going to change that so domestic
 
01:08:32.709 --> 01:08:32.719 align:start position:0%
violence is
 
01:08:37.550 --> 01:08:37.560 align:start position:0%
a it's just a difficult problem and it's
 
01:08:40.749 --> 01:08:40.759 align:start position:0%
really hard to use the it's even harder
 
01:08:43.390 --> 01:08:43.400 align:start position:0%
to use the bill system to make any
 
01:08:45.269 --> 01:08:45.279 align:start position:0%
progress in solving the problem with
 
01:08:47.229 --> 01:08:47.239 align:start position:0%
domestic violence crimes than it is with
 
01:08:49.590 --> 01:08:49.600 align:start position:0%
addiction or mental health it's just a
 
01:08:53.510 --> 01:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
really hard problem that said a separate
 
01:08:55.269 --> 01:08:55.279 align:start position:0%
issue issue with
 
01:08:58.789 --> 01:08:58.799 align:start position:0%
including misdemeanors at all on this
 
01:09:02.149 --> 01:09:02.159 align:start position:0%
list is it means there's going to be a
 
01:09:05.870 --> 01:09:05.880 align:start position:0%
heck of a lot more hearings on Saturday
 
01:09:08.430 --> 01:09:08.440 align:start position:0%
and Sunday and I think you've heard from
 
01:09:11.349 --> 01:09:11.359 align:start position:0%
the court system before on the the list
 
01:09:15.189 --> 01:09:15.199 align:start position:0%
that was in uh Senator susi's Bill has
 
01:09:17.510 --> 01:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
been in Senator Bradley's bill in the
 
01:09:21.590 --> 01:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
past that most comprehensive list uh
 
01:09:25.149 --> 01:09:25.159 align:start position:0%
would involve 3 to 4,000 more hearings
 
01:09:27.749 --> 01:09:27.759 align:start position:0%
than there would otherwise be because it
 
01:09:31.910 --> 01:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
has misdemeanors on it so put us it's an
 
01:09:33.349 --> 01:09:33.359 align:start position:0%
odd thing to say but putting aside the
 
01:09:35.950 --> 01:09:35.960 align:start position:0%
Constitutional issues there's a real
 
01:09:39.470 --> 01:09:39.480 align:start position:0%
Court expense to having misdemeanors on
 
01:09:42.309 --> 01:09:42.319 align:start position:0%
that list rather than just having
 
01:09:44.630 --> 01:09:44.640 align:start position:0%
felonies and and it's a balancing you
 
01:09:46.789 --> 01:09:46.799 align:start position:0%
know it's not there's not a nice simple
 
01:09:50.630 --> 01:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
answer um you know I the last just
 
01:09:52.189 --> 01:09:52.199 align:start position:0%
transition to the last thing I want to
 
01:09:55.270 --> 01:09:55.280 align:start position:0%
say is I'm an advocate for having
 
01:09:58.830 --> 01:09:58.840 align:start position:0%
felonious stalking felonious uh domestic
 
01:10:04.270 --> 01:10:04.280 align:start position:0%
violence on the list um uh and uh
 
01:10:07.510 --> 01:10:07.520 align:start position:0%
because you know those are particularly
 
01:10:11.790 --> 01:10:11.800 align:start position:0%
serious domestic violence related crimes
 
01:10:14.510 --> 01:10:14.520 align:start position:0%
not to suggest that other misdemeanor
 
01:10:17.070 --> 01:10:17.080 align:start position:0%
domestic violence isn't serious but in
 
01:10:20.709 --> 01:10:20.719 align:start position:0%
terms of you know at least a 24-hour
 
01:10:22.950 --> 01:10:22.960 align:start position:0%
hold if we have a system where there's
 
01:10:25.750 --> 01:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
they're going to see in 24 hours I think
 
01:10:29.950 --> 01:10:29.960 align:start position:0%
that's really important um uh you
 
01:10:34.110 --> 01:10:34.120 align:start position:0%
know um so uh that's what that's what I
 
01:10:35.630 --> 01:10:35.640 align:start position:0%
advocate I understand there's different
 
01:10:39.990 --> 01:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
views on that but I I I I think the the
 
01:10:42.630 --> 01:10:42.640 align:start position:0%
committee is is really beginning to
 
01:10:44.790 --> 01:10:44.800 align:start position:0%
understand there's not a neat and tidy
 
01:10:46.910 --> 01:10:46.920 align:start position:0%
answer to this that it involves a
 
01:10:49.110 --> 01:10:49.120 align:start position:0%
balancing of court costs it involves a
 
01:10:50.950 --> 01:10:50.960 align:start position:0%
balancing of constitutional rights it
 
01:10:54.430 --> 01:10:54.440 align:start position:0%
involves a balancing of Public Safety
 
01:10:56.550 --> 01:10:56.560 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:11:00.910 --> 01:11:00.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:04.430 --> 01:11:04.440 align:start position:0%
box yeah when it when it comes
 
01:11:08.750 --> 01:11:08.760 align:start position:0%
to one of the things um an impression I
 
01:11:10.550 --> 01:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
I get every time I hear testimony from
 
01:11:13.350 --> 01:11:13.360 align:start position:0%
Bill Commissioners is that there do seem
 
01:11:15.430 --> 01:11:15.440 align:start position:0%
to be a different set of personal
 
01:11:17.470 --> 01:11:17.480 align:start position:0%
standards that people use in in making
 
01:11:21.470 --> 01:11:21.480 align:start position:0%
these decisions so if we don't put
 
01:11:23.110 --> 01:11:23.120 align:start position:0%
something like misdemeanor domestic
 
01:11:25.790 --> 01:11:25.800 align:start position:0%
violence you know on this list then
 
01:11:27.709 --> 01:11:27.719 align:start position:0%
basically it would go back and be
 
01:11:29.030 --> 01:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
something where we would be really
 
01:11:31.270 --> 01:11:31.280 align:start position:0%
dependent on bail Commissioners to make
 
01:11:33.870 --> 01:11:33.880 align:start position:0%
a really good decision so with that in
 
01:11:36.790 --> 01:11:36.800 align:start position:0%
mind should we do something like that do
 
01:11:40.590 --> 01:11:40.600 align:start position:0%
you think part of whatever we wind up
 
01:11:45.470 --> 01:11:45.480 align:start position:0%
proposing uh should include um training
 
01:11:47.350 --> 01:11:47.360 align:start position:0%
and perhaps mandatory training for bail
 
01:11:50.229 --> 01:11:50.239 align:start position:0%
Commissioners specifically in these in
 
01:11:53.950 --> 01:11:53.960 align:start position:0%
areas things that maybe on this list now
 
01:11:55.550 --> 01:11:55.560 align:start position:0%
that might not wind up being on the
 
01:11:58.830 --> 01:11:58.840 align:start position:0%
final list or some of the things that we
 
01:12:00.149 --> 01:12:00.159 align:start position:0%
we've actually already talked about one
 
01:12:01.709 --> 01:12:01.719 align:start position:0%
crime that's not on the list that maybe
 
01:12:04.990 --> 01:12:05.000 align:start position:0%
should be uh I'm I'm I'm always an
 
01:12:07.390 --> 01:12:07.400 align:start position:0%
advocate of uh training not only for
 
01:12:10.070 --> 01:12:10.080 align:start position:0%
bail Commissioners but for judges you
 
01:12:13.229 --> 01:12:13.239 align:start position:0%
know if I were I will be very blunt with
 
01:12:15.830 --> 01:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
the committee on domestic violence
 
01:12:19.229 --> 01:12:19.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:22.229 --> 01:12:22.239 align:start position:0%
judges make any better set of decisions
 
01:12:24.510 --> 01:12:24.520 align:start position:0%
as to bail on domestic violence crimes
 
01:12:27.350 --> 01:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
than bail Commissioners do you know so I
 
01:12:29.870 --> 01:12:29.880 align:start position:0%
think it's training across the board and
 
01:12:34.229 --> 01:12:34.239 align:start position:0%
and and I know uh the uh spiran district
 
01:12:36.830 --> 01:12:36.840 align:start position:0%
courts have made aggressive efforts to
 
01:12:40.149 --> 01:12:40.159 align:start position:0%
do better training um
 
01:12:40.159 --> 01:12:43.430 align:start position:0%
do better training um
um

01:12:43.430 --> 01:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:46.870 --> 01:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
again I I hate to be so end on such a
 
01:12:49.629 --> 01:12:49.639 align:start position:0%
Negative note the problem of domestic
 
01:12:51.470 --> 01:12:51.480 align:start position:0%
violence in the criminal justice system
 
01:12:54.709 --> 01:12:54.719 align:start position:0%
is a big one and uh it's really hard to
 
01:12:59.990 --> 01:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
manage it's and the bail is
 
01:13:02.870 --> 01:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
just there's not that much other than
 
01:13:04.790 --> 01:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
holding anyone charged with domestic
 
01:13:06.750 --> 01:13:06.760 align:start position:0%
violence until they see
 
01:13:10.629 --> 01:13:10.639 align:start position:0%
trial um there's no easy solution and
 
01:13:12.910 --> 01:13:12.920 align:start position:0%
you know for the reasons I've described
 
01:13:16.830 --> 01:13:16.840 align:start position:0%
it's just really hard problem I hate
 
01:13:21.070 --> 01:13:21.080 align:start position:0%
to I hate to be so negative but that's
 
01:13:25.030 --> 01:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
what I've seen over 40 years thank you
 
01:13:26.590 --> 01:13:26.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
01:13:29.629 --> 01:13:29.639 align:start position:0%
Professor um hold on
 
01:13:32.270 --> 01:13:32.280 align:start position:0%
um we've heard uh we've heard quite a
 
01:13:37.189 --> 01:13:37.199 align:start position:0%
bit of testimony um and my intent is um
 
01:13:38.590 --> 01:13:38.600 align:start position:0%
we're going to take a probably a
 
01:13:40.870 --> 01:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
15minute vir break in a minute and when
 
01:13:43.350 --> 01:13:43.360 align:start position:0%
I come back we've heard a lot of
 
01:13:46.270 --> 01:13:46.280 align:start position:0%
testimony and we've we've mostly been
 
01:13:49.350 --> 01:13:49.360 align:start position:0%
talking about bail Commissioners um and
 
01:13:50.910 --> 01:13:50.920 align:start position:0%
and right in front of their faces so
 
01:13:52.470 --> 01:13:52.480 align:start position:0%
we're going to let them talk to us when
 
01:13:54.229 --> 01:13:54.239 align:start position:0%
we come back I want to hear from the
 
01:13:56.750 --> 01:13:56.760 align:start position:0%
bail Commissioners all including um
 
01:13:59.189 --> 01:13:59.199 align:start position:0%
representative scitec if you'd like to
 
01:14:01.070 --> 01:14:01.080 align:start position:0%
add something real quick right now this
 
01:14:03.270 --> 01:14:03.280 align:start position:0%
would be very quick I yearned to say
 
01:14:06.229 --> 01:14:06.239 align:start position:0%
many things but let me stick to one fact
 
01:14:07.310 --> 01:14:07.320 align:start position:0%
there was
 
01:14:10.430 --> 01:14:10.440 align:start position:0%
almost horror talked about because the
 
01:14:13.510 --> 01:14:13.520 align:start position:0%
papers are so long getting to the court
 
01:14:15.669 --> 01:14:15.679 align:start position:0%
the bail commissioner's handbook written
 
01:14:17.629 --> 01:14:17.639 align:start position:0%
by the judicial branch gives bail
 
01:14:20.470 --> 01:14:20.480 align:start position:0%
Commissioners two two days to get the
 
01:14:24.229 --> 01:14:24.239 align:start position:0%
papers back to the court that's the fact
 
01:14:25.750 --> 01:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
are you aware of how long it takes the
 
01:14:26.950 --> 01:14:26.960 align:start position:0%
court to get them entered into the
 
01:14:28.790 --> 01:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
system so that everyone else knows about
 
01:14:32.070 --> 01:14:32.080 align:start position:0%
them I have no idea but I wholeheartedly
 
01:14:34.590 --> 01:14:34.600 align:start position:0%
support your idea of Greater and
 
01:14:36.149 --> 01:14:36.159 align:start position:0%
everybody's idea of Greater
 
01:14:38.229 --> 01:14:38.239 align:start position:0%
communication that baale in Manchester
 
01:14:41.110 --> 01:14:41.120 align:start position:0%
should be known throughout the state but
 
01:14:43.830 --> 01:14:43.840 align:start position:0%
that's I that's in a different I'm
 
01:14:45.629 --> 01:14:45.639 align:start position:0%
talking Beyond
 
01:14:49.070 --> 01:14:49.080 align:start position:0%
facts um representative did you want to
 
01:14:51.629 --> 01:14:51.639 align:start position:0%
add something yes I did Mr chairman
 
01:14:55.590 --> 01:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
thank you so we came here last week and
 
01:14:57.430 --> 01:14:57.440 align:start position:0%
we heard a lot of testimony we are we're
 
01:14:59.310 --> 01:14:59.320 align:start position:0%
sitting here again this morning and
 
01:15:01.149 --> 01:15:01.159 align:start position:0%
we're hearing a lot of
 
01:15:05.550 --> 01:15:05.560 align:start position:0%
testimony and the one thing that I think
 
01:15:08.390 --> 01:15:08.400 align:start position:0%
that we as a committee understand
 
01:15:12.149 --> 01:15:12.159 align:start position:0%
is the victims of these crimes should
 
01:15:14.990 --> 01:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
never under any circumstances be blamed
 
01:15:17.070 --> 01:15:17.080 align:start position:0%
for being the victim of a
 
01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:18.669 align:start position:0%
for being the victim of a
crime

01:15:18.669 --> 01:15:18.679 align:start position:0%
crime
 
01:15:22.189 --> 01:15:22.199 align:start position:0%
and I can appreciate the testimony we're
 
01:15:25.430 --> 01:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
hearing but I also know that when you
 
01:15:28.950 --> 01:15:28.960 align:start position:0%
have a domestic violence
 
01:15:32.390 --> 01:15:32.400 align:start position:0%
victim these human beings are either
 
01:15:36.189 --> 01:15:36.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:39.430 --> 01:15:39.440 align:start position:0%
or they're just being degraded into
 
01:15:43.350 --> 01:15:43.360 align:start position:0%
submission so maybe holding them for 24
 
01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:44.270 align:start position:0%
submission so maybe holding them for 24
hours

01:15:44.270 --> 01:15:44.280 align:start position:0%
hours
 
01:15:47.310 --> 01:15:47.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't give the perpetrator a cool down
 
01:15:49.229 --> 01:15:49.239 align:start position:0%
period but what it does
 
01:15:52.430 --> 01:15:52.440 align:start position:0%
do it gives that victim and those
 
01:15:55.709 --> 01:15:55.719 align:start position:0%
children a chance to get to a safe house
 
01:15:58.510 --> 01:15:58.520 align:start position:0%
it gives them a chance to get some funds
 
01:16:01.510 --> 01:16:01.520 align:start position:0%
and get away and I think that we need to
 
01:16:03.270 --> 01:16:03.280 align:start position:0%
get back to focus on the victims of
 
01:16:03.280 --> 01:16:04.270 align:start position:0%
get back to focus on the victims of
these

01:16:04.270 --> 01:16:04.280 align:start position:0%
these
 
01:16:08.110 --> 01:16:08.120 align:start position:0%
crimes not protecting the perpetrator
 
01:16:09.790 --> 01:16:09.800 align:start position:0%
and finding an
 
01:16:13.030 --> 01:16:13.040 align:start position:0%
excuse I I wholeheartedly agree except
 
01:16:16.110 --> 01:16:16.120 align:start position:0%
for a very small alleged perpetrator and
 
01:16:18.030 --> 01:16:18.040 align:start position:0%
we always have to keep that in mind even
 
01:16:21.669 --> 01:16:21.679 align:start position:0%
even even though it hurts I I agree that
 
01:16:24.709 --> 01:16:24.719 align:start position:0%
um that period of time does does give uh
 
01:16:27.070 --> 01:16:27.080 align:start position:0%
the victims a chance to collect
 
01:16:31.310 --> 01:16:31.320 align:start position:0%
themselves and and get some protection
 
01:16:33.110 --> 01:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
but we always have to keep in mind it's
 
01:16:35.830 --> 01:16:35.840 align:start position:0%
aend as much as we know it may be not be
 
01:16:38.070 --> 01:16:38.080 align:start position:0%
in and however we feel personally but I
 
01:16:40.189 --> 01:16:40.199 align:start position:0%
I wholeheartedly agree that a certain
 
01:16:42.550 --> 01:16:42.560 align:start position:0%
period of time isn't necessarily only
 
01:16:46.030 --> 01:16:46.040 align:start position:0%
for the defendant um to cool down but
 
01:16:48.830 --> 01:16:48.840 align:start position:0%
also exactly to your point for the
 
01:16:51.390 --> 01:16:51.400 align:start position:0%
victim to um to get themselves someplace
 
01:16:53.229 --> 01:16:53.239 align:start position:0%
safe and the help they need for them fam
 
01:16:55.950 --> 01:16:55.960 align:start position:0%
and their children um with that being
 
01:16:58.550 --> 01:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
said we're going to take a um 15 did you
 
01:17:00.590 --> 01:17:00.600 align:start position:0%
have I represent did you need to add
 
01:17:01.870 --> 01:17:01.880 align:start position:0%
something you we're going to take a
 
01:17:05.270 --> 01:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
15minute break um so we'll be back here
 
01:17:09.149 --> 01:17:09.159 align:start position:0%
at um 20 let's just break until 20 till
 
01:17:10.790 --> 01:17:10.800 align:start position:0%
at which time I'm going to ask the bail
 
01:17:14.470 --> 01:17:14.480 align:start position:0%
Commissioners to um address us and maybe
 
01:17:17.070 --> 01:17:17.080 align:start position:0%
take some questions and then we'll end
 
01:17:19.070 --> 01:17:19.080 align:start position:0%
the day with um some discussion on the
 
01:17:20.669 --> 01:17:20.679 align:start position:0%
committee about everything we've heard
 
01:17:23.870 --> 01:17:23.880 align:start position:0%
is everybody okay with that okay we will
 
01:17:51.990 --> 01:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:52.000 --> 01:36:50.270 align:start position:0%
 
minutes

01:36:50.270 --> 01:36:50.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:50.280 --> 01:39:50.030 align:start position:0%
 
e

01:39:50.030 --> 01:39:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:50.040 --> 01:45:03.950 align:start position:0%
 
e

01:45:03.950 --> 01:45:03.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:06.550 --> 01:45:06.560 align:start position:0%
and we are back I apologize for the
 
01:45:08.750 --> 01:45:08.760 align:start position:0%
delay but fortuitously I ran into into
 
01:45:11.109 --> 01:45:11.119 align:start position:0%
one of the finance chairman um because
 
01:45:12.430 --> 01:45:12.440 align:start position:0%
we have been talking about spending a
 
01:45:15.589 --> 01:45:15.599 align:start position:0%
lot of money in here and um he is going
 
01:45:18.470 --> 01:45:18.480 align:start position:0%
to come next Thursday represent wer and
 
01:45:20.790 --> 01:45:20.800 align:start position:0%
we're going to pitch Loosely some of the
 
01:45:23.750 --> 01:45:23.760 align:start position:0%
ideas we have and uh he's going to tell
 
01:45:26.350 --> 01:45:26.360 align:start position:0%
us whether or not um there's even money
 
01:45:28.070 --> 01:45:28.080 align:start position:0%
for it before we get too far down the
 
01:45:30.109 --> 01:45:30.119 align:start position:0%
street and then we'll have them come
 
01:45:31.870 --> 01:45:31.880 align:start position:0%
back again when we have some more hard
 
01:45:34.270 --> 01:45:34.280 align:start position:0%
numbers for him so I think that that's a
 
01:45:36.229 --> 01:45:36.239 align:start position:0%
good start as far as making sure we're
 
01:45:39.870 --> 01:45:39.880 align:start position:0%
not contemplating Pie in the Sky
 
01:45:43.990 --> 01:45:44.000 align:start position:0%
um and um I don't have any control over
 
01:45:48.229 --> 01:45:48.239 align:start position:0%
that so at this point I would really
 
01:45:50.870 --> 01:45:50.880 align:start position:0%
like to hear from the bail commissioners
 
01:45:55.189 --> 01:45:55.199 align:start position:0%
um I'll start um with um Mr far you you
 
01:45:56.950 --> 01:45:56.960 align:start position:0%
you are no longer officially a bail
 
01:45:58.910 --> 01:45:58.920 align:start position:0%
commissioner but you have more years
 
01:46:02.350 --> 01:46:02.360 align:start position:0%
doing it than most of us have um on this
 
01:46:04.750 --> 01:46:04.760 align:start position:0%
committee or any other so we'll start
 
01:46:06.709 --> 01:46:06.719 align:start position:0%
with you and then we'll move down to
 
01:46:09.830 --> 01:46:09.840 align:start position:0%
whoever who else would like to
 
01:46:12.109 --> 01:46:12.119 align:start position:0%
testify for the record I do not believe
 
01:46:14.510 --> 01:46:14.520 align:start position:0%
representative scitec will be testifying
 
01:46:16.669 --> 01:46:16.679 align:start position:0%
he's more of a uh more of a source for
 
01:46:19.589 --> 01:46:19.599 align:start position:0%
us to tap when we're in our discussions
 
01:46:21.350 --> 01:46:21.360 align:start position:0%
um and we will certainly be utilizing
 
01:46:23.310 --> 01:46:23.320 align:start position:0%
him so with that I give you the floor
 
01:46:25.470 --> 01:46:25.480 align:start position:0%
thank you my name is Trixie lefave I had
 
01:46:27.709 --> 01:46:27.719 align:start position:0%
been a bail commissioner for 14 years
 
01:46:29.990 --> 01:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
and resigned effective August 31st of
 
01:46:32.270 --> 01:46:32.280 align:start position:0%
this year committee is on the right
 
01:46:34.390 --> 01:46:34.400 align:start position:0%
track and I really appreciate that some
 
01:46:35.950 --> 01:46:35.960 align:start position:0%
of the things that I heard this morning
 
01:46:37.589 --> 01:46:37.599 align:start position:0%
though that I just wanted
 
01:46:41.629 --> 01:46:41.639 align:start position:0%
to um clarify from my experience I can
 
01:46:45.070 --> 01:46:45.080 align:start position:0%
only speak to my experience but um it
 
01:46:47.430 --> 01:46:47.440 align:start position:0%
was mentioned that we possibly as a bail
 
01:46:48.790 --> 01:46:48.800 align:start position:0%
commissioner when we're meeting with a
 
01:46:50.750 --> 01:46:50.760 align:start position:0%
defendant do not have access access to
 
01:46:52.390 --> 01:46:52.400 align:start position:0%
their criminal history in the smaller
 
01:46:54.310 --> 01:46:54.320 align:start position:0%
departments especially because they
 
01:46:56.550 --> 01:46:56.560 align:start position:0%
don't have a dispatcher I do know that
 
01:46:58.870 --> 01:46:58.880 align:start position:0%
when I was working for the Derry Circuit
 
01:47:01.510 --> 01:47:01.520 align:start position:0%
Court uh if I would respond to Sandown
 
01:47:04.510 --> 01:47:04.520 align:start position:0%
or Chester the sheriff's department was
 
01:47:05.990 --> 01:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
responsible for getting the criminal
 
01:47:08.669 --> 01:47:08.679 align:start position:0%
history to the police department via
 
01:47:11.750 --> 01:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
fact and then I would review it never
 
01:47:14.109 --> 01:47:14.119 align:start position:0%
should a bail commissioner and I did not
 
01:47:15.709 --> 01:47:15.719 align:start position:0%
but never should a bail commissioner
 
01:47:18.070 --> 01:47:18.080 align:start position:0%
process an individual without having the
 
01:47:19.950 --> 01:47:19.960 align:start position:0%
criminal history in front of them it's
 
01:47:22.990 --> 01:47:23.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely Ely important on that same
 
01:47:25.149 --> 01:47:25.159 align:start position:0%
note there is also information if there
 
01:47:27.350 --> 01:47:27.360 align:start position:0%
are restraining orders against this
 
01:47:30.189 --> 01:47:30.199 align:start position:0%
particular person that we're processing
 
01:47:33.510 --> 01:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
um which then takes me over to the
 
01:47:37.109 --> 01:47:37.119 align:start position:0%
criminal bail protective order um those
 
01:47:38.950 --> 01:47:38.960 align:start position:0%
are sent up to New Hampshire State
 
01:47:40.589 --> 01:47:40.599 align:start position:0%
Police immediately when I worked for
 
01:47:41.990 --> 01:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
Manchester and it's in the bail
 
01:47:43.669 --> 01:47:43.679 align:start position:0%
commissioner's handbook that we must
 
01:47:45.950 --> 01:47:45.960 align:start position:0%
send it up to them immediately that's
 
01:47:47.430 --> 01:47:47.440 align:start position:0%
facts from the Manchester Police
 
01:47:50.030 --> 01:47:50.040 align:start position:0%
Department so the state of New Hampshire
 
01:47:52.149 --> 01:47:52.159 align:start position:0%
every law enforcement agency should be
 
01:47:54.910 --> 01:47:54.920 align:start position:0%
aware of that within a half hour of our
 
01:47:57.430 --> 01:47:57.440 align:start position:0%
booking and processing the individual I
 
01:48:00.990 --> 01:48:01.000 align:start position:0%
should say uh because it's in the
 
01:48:03.430 --> 01:48:03.440 align:start position:0%
system with regard to what you're
 
01:48:05.990 --> 01:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
thinking with your charges that um an
 
01:48:08.229 --> 01:48:08.239 align:start position:0%
individual would not see a bail
 
01:48:10.430 --> 01:48:10.440 align:start position:0%
commissioner you speak of domestic
 
01:48:12.790 --> 01:48:12.800 align:start position:0%
violence I'm not pitching one way or
 
01:48:15.629 --> 01:48:15.639 align:start position:0%
another What charges would not be seen
 
01:48:17.109 --> 01:48:17.119 align:start position:0%
by a bail commissioner and what would go
 
01:48:19.870 --> 01:48:19.880 align:start position:0%
to a judge I just want this committee to
 
01:48:20.750 --> 01:48:20.760 align:start position:0%
understand that
 
01:48:22.750 --> 01:48:22.760 align:start position:0%
when a person has been charged with
 
01:48:25.510 --> 01:48:25.520 align:start position:0%
domestic violence you have a victim if
 
01:48:27.510 --> 01:48:27.520 align:start position:0%
they do not see a bail commissioner or
 
01:48:29.270 --> 01:48:29.280 align:start position:0%
if they are not processed immediately
 
01:48:31.790 --> 01:48:31.800 align:start position:0%
but taken to a county jail and held
 
01:48:34.510 --> 01:48:34.520 align:start position:0%
whether it's for 24 hours or 48 hours
 
01:48:36.790 --> 01:48:36.800 align:start position:0%
there is no order of protection for that
 
01:48:40.390 --> 01:48:40.400 align:start position:0%
victim so that that alleged perpetrator
 
01:48:43.229 --> 01:48:43.239 align:start position:0%
could reach out to that victim from jail
 
01:48:45.830 --> 01:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
to continue with acts of intimidation
 
01:48:47.870 --> 01:48:47.880 align:start position:0%
could call a friend to have acts of
 
01:48:50.189 --> 01:48:50.199 align:start position:0%
intimidation so when this committee
 
01:48:52.470 --> 01:48:52.480 align:start position:0%
makes that decision Please be aware that
 
01:48:54.990 --> 01:48:55.000 align:start position:0%
there has there should be an order of
 
01:48:57.870 --> 01:48:57.880 align:start position:0%
protection for that victim immediately
 
01:48:59.629 --> 01:48:59.639 align:start position:0%
when the decision is made whether this
 
01:49:02.070 --> 01:49:02.080 align:start position:0%
defendant is going to go to jail or be
 
01:49:04.950 --> 01:49:04.960 align:start position:0%
seen by a bail commissioner may I just
 
01:49:06.270 --> 01:49:06.280 align:start position:0%
interrup I don't want to interrupt but I
 
01:49:08.990 --> 01:49:09.000 align:start position:0%
have to I I need to know so is it
 
01:49:12.390 --> 01:49:12.400 align:start position:0%
possible though for for example say um
 
01:49:13.910 --> 01:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
the police arrest someone on domestic
 
01:49:16.870 --> 01:49:16.880 align:start position:0%
violence charge and it's one that in the
 
01:49:19.030 --> 01:49:19.040 align:start position:0%
contemplated would not be um bailable by
 
01:49:21.310 --> 01:49:21.320 align:start position:0%
a bail commissioner can they not call
 
01:49:23.629 --> 01:49:23.639 align:start position:0%
the judge to get an emergency
 
01:49:26.149 --> 01:49:26.159 align:start position:0%
order they can call for an emergency
 
01:49:26.159 --> 01:49:28.109 align:start position:0%
order they can call for an emergency
order

01:49:28.109 --> 01:49:28.119 align:start position:0%
order
 
01:49:32.109 --> 01:49:32.119 align:start position:0%
but the emergency order is and you know
 
01:49:34.830 --> 01:49:34.840 align:start position:0%
have to I'm not I'm not part of that
 
01:49:36.589 --> 01:49:36.599 align:start position:0%
process with an emergency order I hadn't
 
01:49:38.310 --> 01:49:38.320 align:start position:0%
been I should
 
01:49:40.830 --> 01:49:40.840 align:start position:0%
say I am assuming that the answer to
 
01:49:45.270 --> 01:49:45.280 align:start position:0%
that is yes um but the alleged
 
01:49:47.709 --> 01:49:47.719 align:start position:0%
perpetrator is not being charged with
 
01:49:51.629 --> 01:49:51.639 align:start position:0%
any well is not being processed for the
 
01:49:56.310 --> 01:49:56.320 align:start position:0%
crimes so the bail order or the bail
 
01:49:59.870 --> 01:49:59.880 align:start position:0%
process would take place days later so I
 
01:50:01.390 --> 01:50:01.400 align:start position:0%
guess there you would need to seek
 
01:50:03.030 --> 01:50:03.040 align:start position:0%
clarification on that so there's two
 
01:50:06.070 --> 01:50:06.080 align:start position:0%
tracks there's the bail conditions which
 
01:50:08.629 --> 01:50:08.639 align:start position:0%
would set no contact with the victim Etc
 
01:50:09.950 --> 01:50:09.960 align:start position:0%
which you are saying if we didn't have a
 
01:50:11.310 --> 01:50:11.320 align:start position:0%
bail commissioner and they get sent to
 
01:50:14.270 --> 01:50:14.280 align:start position:0%
Valley Street they could contact because
 
01:50:16.189 --> 01:50:16.199 align:start position:0%
there's no bail conditions on the
 
01:50:18.270 --> 01:50:18.280 align:start position:0%
alternative though the judge an
 
01:50:19.910 --> 01:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
emergency order could be issued as far
 
01:50:22.030 --> 01:50:22.040 align:start position:0%
as you know that would do the same thing
 
01:50:24.550 --> 01:50:24.560 align:start position:0%
it just would require the judge correct
 
01:50:26.270 --> 01:50:26.280 align:start position:0%
and that would mean possibly for the
 
01:50:28.550 --> 01:50:28.560 align:start position:0%
committee two calls to a judge one for
 
01:50:30.510 --> 01:50:30.520 align:start position:0%
the emergency order and then within 24
 
01:50:32.790 --> 01:50:32.800 align:start position:0%
hours another for the whether or not to
 
01:50:34.430 --> 01:50:34.440 align:start position:0%
hold or let them go for the actual
 
01:50:36.390 --> 01:50:36.400 align:start position:0%
arraignment okay please continue re and
 
01:50:38.990 --> 01:50:39.000 align:start position:0%
I apologize that's thank you um and my
 
01:50:41.709 --> 01:50:41.719 align:start position:0%
final note is um as you are joining
 
01:50:44.990 --> 01:50:45.000 align:start position:0%
other members of the um of this Pro of
 
01:50:48.030 --> 01:50:48.040 align:start position:0%
the process of defendants is um you know
 
01:50:50.270 --> 01:50:50.280 align:start position:0%
processing defendants there are are
 
01:50:52.149 --> 01:50:52.159 align:start position:0%
times when these individuals are on
 
01:50:54.350 --> 01:50:54.360 align:start position:0%
probation or parole and that you should
 
01:50:56.550 --> 01:50:56.560 align:start position:0%
be able to pick up in the criminal order
 
01:50:57.790 --> 01:50:57.800 align:start position:0%
that you're looking at you know their
 
01:51:00.870 --> 01:51:00.880 align:start position:0%
the criminal history I have to tell you
 
01:51:05.790 --> 01:51:05.800 align:start position:0%
that in my 14 years of trying to contact
 
01:51:07.830 --> 01:51:07.840 align:start position:0%
probation of parole officer to determine
 
01:51:12.550 --> 01:51:12.560 align:start position:0%
if they want a 72-hour hold um probably
 
01:51:15.189 --> 01:51:15.199 align:start position:0%
1% of the time and it could be a Friday
 
01:51:17.069 --> 01:51:17.079 align:start position:0%
afternoon and I have someone in front of
 
01:51:18.790 --> 01:51:18.800 align:start position:0%
me and trying to reach their parole
 
01:51:20.229 --> 01:51:20.239 align:start position:0%
officer or their probation offer office
 
01:51:23.910 --> 01:51:23.920 align:start position:0%
to determine what they want to do um is
 
01:51:26.310 --> 01:51:26.320 align:start position:0%
darn near impossible so I think that as
 
01:51:29.030 --> 01:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
you look at all of this as well you need
 
01:51:32.109 --> 01:51:32.119 align:start position:0%
to pull into the the grand scheme of
 
01:51:34.149 --> 01:51:34.159 align:start position:0%
things the probation of parole should be
 
01:51:36.430 --> 01:51:36.440 align:start position:0%
as accessible as the judges are after
 
01:51:38.669 --> 01:51:38.679 align:start position:0%
hours thank you actually I was
 
01:51:42.350 --> 01:51:42.360 align:start position:0%
contemplating um this I know that in in
 
01:51:44.550 --> 01:51:44.560 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and I hate to use them as
 
01:51:47.750 --> 01:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
an example but um some things they have
 
01:51:50.910 --> 01:51:50.920 align:start position:0%
right if if someone even if a police
 
01:51:53.470 --> 01:51:53.480 align:start position:0%
department even runs a record check on
 
01:51:55.589 --> 01:51:55.599 align:start position:0%
one of their parole e the system
 
01:51:57.430 --> 01:51:57.440 align:start position:0%
automatically pings that parole officer
 
01:52:00.109 --> 01:52:00.119 align:start position:0%
and says someone's run your guy which
 
01:52:01.669 --> 01:52:01.679 align:start position:0%
point it triggers him to call the police
 
01:52:03.589 --> 01:52:03.599 align:start position:0%
and say why'd you run my guy if he's
 
01:52:05.910 --> 01:52:05.920 align:start position:0%
violating his Pearl at that point so I I
 
01:52:07.510 --> 01:52:07.520 align:start position:0%
think you're you're absolutely on the
 
01:52:09.270 --> 01:52:09.280 align:start position:0%
Mark we need to make sure we tie in all
 
01:52:10.870 --> 01:52:10.880 align:start position:0%
these and even if it's only an
 
01:52:12.629 --> 01:52:12.639 align:start position:0%
electronic notification that their
 
01:52:14.750 --> 01:52:14.760 align:start position:0%
person has been held they get it on the
 
01:52:16.950 --> 01:52:16.960 align:start position:0%
weekend and whatever time of night it is
 
01:52:18.470 --> 01:52:18.480 align:start position:0%
they they get notified because I know
 
01:52:20.709 --> 01:52:20.719 align:start position:0%
parole officers I I believe are you know
 
01:52:22.470 --> 01:52:22.480 align:start position:0%
technically 24 hours a day they're
 
01:52:25.990 --> 01:52:26.000 align:start position:0%
supposed to be um on the job so to speak
 
01:52:28.270 --> 01:52:28.280 align:start position:0%
um that is what we are told so we have
 
01:52:30.030 --> 01:52:30.040 align:start position:0%
never seen that as a practice but that
 
01:52:32.910 --> 01:52:32.920 align:start position:0%
is what we are told indeed
 
01:52:34.910 --> 01:52:34.920 align:start position:0%
representative go ahead thank you Mr
 
01:52:36.790 --> 01:52:36.800 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
01:52:39.350 --> 01:52:39.360 align:start position:0%
question I I would like to clarify
 
01:52:42.910 --> 01:52:42.920 align:start position:0%
something we had heard that that bill
 
01:52:45.189 --> 01:52:45.199 align:start position:0%
Commissioners have is it 48 hours I
 
01:52:47.870 --> 01:52:47.880 align:start position:0%
believe to get to get the bail order to
 
01:52:47.880 --> 01:52:48.589 align:start position:0%
believe to get to get the bail order to
the

01:52:48.589 --> 01:52:48.599 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:52:51.229 --> 01:52:51.239 align:start position:0%
court and we're talking about having an
 
01:52:52.709 --> 01:52:52.719 align:start position:0%
electronic system you know we're kind of
 
01:52:54.629 --> 01:52:54.639 align:start position:0%
stuck in the 70s 80s over here in New
 
01:52:58.550 --> 01:52:58.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so would it be helpful or did
 
01:53:00.950 --> 01:53:00.960 align:start position:0%
the bail Commissioners have access to I
 
01:53:02.990 --> 01:53:03.000 align:start position:0%
I know I used to use a online it was
 
01:53:05.790 --> 01:53:05.800 align:start position:0%
called doc you sign and the document the
 
01:53:07.830 --> 01:53:07.840 align:start position:0%
legal documents were already uploaded
 
01:53:09.629 --> 01:53:09.639 align:start position:0%
into that you you know kind of filled it
 
01:53:10.990 --> 01:53:11.000 align:start position:0%
out and sent to the person and it kind
 
01:53:13.270 --> 01:53:13.280 align:start position:0%
of walks them right through so would
 
01:53:14.430 --> 01:53:14.440 align:start position:0%
that be helpful if the bail
 
01:53:15.910 --> 01:53:15.920 align:start position:0%
Commissioners had access to something
 
01:53:17.550 --> 01:53:17.560 align:start position:0%
like that and then they literally could
 
01:53:19.270 --> 01:53:19.280 align:start position:0%
just hit the submit button and go right
 
01:53:20.830 --> 01:53:20.840 align:start position:0%
to the court instead of having to wait
 
01:53:23.069 --> 01:53:23.079 align:start position:0%
for it to kind of wander around and
 
01:53:24.910 --> 01:53:24.920 align:start position:0%
snail mail I'm sure that that would be
 
01:53:27.629 --> 01:53:27.639 align:start position:0%
very helpful um but I do know that when
 
01:53:30.189 --> 01:53:30.199 align:start position:0%
we were just as a aside as when we were
 
01:53:32.149 --> 01:53:32.159 align:start position:0%
talking during coid of doing telephonic
 
01:53:34.390 --> 01:53:34.400 align:start position:0%
bailes there were areas of the North
 
01:53:36.350 --> 01:53:36.360 align:start position:0%
Country especially over in the ACP area
 
01:53:38.350 --> 01:53:38.360 align:start position:0%
that they did not have good service good
 
01:53:40.790 --> 01:53:40.800 align:start position:0%
internet service so that was a
 
01:53:43.189 --> 01:53:43.199 align:start position:0%
consideration and then you also then are
 
01:53:45.229 --> 01:53:45.239 align:start position:0%
requiring every bail commissioner to
 
01:53:49.390 --> 01:53:49.400 align:start position:0%
have access to a fax machine or if even
 
01:53:53.030 --> 01:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
if it's um a scanner to scan an email so
 
01:53:54.550 --> 01:53:54.560 align:start position:0%
that would be something that every bail
 
01:53:56.109 --> 01:53:56.119 align:start position:0%
commissioner would have to consider when
 
01:53:57.990 --> 01:53:58.000 align:start position:0%
they were taking their appointment and
 
01:54:00.030 --> 01:54:00.040 align:start position:0%
and which phrases it would be it would
 
01:54:02.830 --> 01:54:02.840 align:start position:0%
automatically be in the system they just
 
01:54:04.470 --> 01:54:04.480 align:start position:0%
hit the button have access to the
 
01:54:06.830 --> 01:54:06.840 align:start position:0%
internet if they had a button um which
 
01:54:09.149 --> 01:54:09.159 align:start position:0%
brings is
 
01:54:11.430 --> 01:54:11.440 align:start position:0%
that okay
 
01:54:14.310 --> 01:54:14.320 align:start position:0%
um I have a this brings a what what kind
 
01:54:16.390 --> 01:54:16.400 align:start position:0%
of equipment U are you are you issued
 
01:54:19.310 --> 01:54:19.320 align:start position:0%
are you issued anything or oh no we're
 
01:54:21.870 --> 01:54:21.880 align:start position:0%
not issued anything no our equipment is
 
01:54:24.830 --> 01:54:24.840 align:start position:0%
pen and paper so if if every bail
 
01:54:27.709 --> 01:54:27.719 align:start position:0%
commissioner were were issued a a laptop
 
01:54:30.109 --> 01:54:30.119 align:start position:0%
with a cell card
 
01:54:33.430 --> 01:54:33.440 align:start position:0%
um would that not and access to criminal
 
01:54:35.149 --> 01:54:35.159 align:start position:0%
records themselves would that not make
 
01:54:40.270 --> 01:54:40.280 align:start position:0%
sense well um I may I answer something
 
01:54:42.390 --> 01:54:42.400 align:start position:0%
I'm I'd like to go to First subject then
 
01:54:45.750 --> 01:54:45.760 align:start position:0%
answer your question is um we during
 
01:54:48.270 --> 01:54:48.280 align:start position:0%
coid we were told tele Bales so we could
 
01:54:50.510 --> 01:54:50.520 align:start position:0%
do those um during during my period of
 
01:54:52.310 --> 01:54:52.320 align:start position:0%
time with Manchester Police Department
 
01:54:54.750 --> 01:54:54.760 align:start position:0%
in order to uh I did try to do some
 
01:54:57.990 --> 01:54:58.000 align:start position:0%
telephonic bailing through them um I was
 
01:54:59.709 --> 01:54:59.719 align:start position:0%
told that I could not get a criminal
 
01:55:01.589 --> 01:55:01.599 align:start position:0%
history because it was coming to a
 
01:55:03.790 --> 01:55:03.800 align:start position:0%
personal email and it has to go to
 
01:55:06.589 --> 01:55:06.599 align:start position:0%
a.gov I brought this subject up to the
 
01:55:09.069 --> 01:55:09.079 align:start position:0%
administrative office of the courts on
 
01:55:10.750 --> 01:55:10.760 align:start position:0%
three separate occasions and I have
 
01:55:13.790 --> 01:55:13.800 align:start position:0%
still not received a response from them
 
01:55:16.510 --> 01:55:16.520 align:start position:0%
so that being said a desktop I'm sure
 
01:55:19.109 --> 01:55:19.119 align:start position:0%
but you may possibly if we can't get an
 
01:55:22.390 --> 01:55:22.400 align:start position:0%
answer from Judiciary in terms of if a
 
01:55:25.030 --> 01:55:25.040 align:start position:0%
personal email can get a criminal
 
01:55:27.310 --> 01:55:27.320 align:start position:0%
background then you may have to issue
 
01:55:29.830 --> 01:55:29.840 align:start position:0%
Dogo addresses to all of your bail
 
01:55:32.430 --> 01:55:32.440 align:start position:0%
Commissioners to bypass that problem if
 
01:55:35.270 --> 01:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
you want to get into tele bailing well
 
01:55:37.669 --> 01:55:37.679 align:start position:0%
that more importantly I think what I'm
 
01:55:39.870 --> 01:55:39.880 align:start position:0%
what I'm contemplating is why would a
 
01:55:41.990 --> 01:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
bail commissioner who has by law the
 
01:55:44.550 --> 01:55:44.560 align:start position:0%
right to see criminal record information
 
01:55:46.669 --> 01:55:46.679 align:start position:0%
not have direct access to criminal
 
01:55:48.990 --> 01:55:49.000 align:start position:0%
offend record information so if you got
 
01:55:53.149 --> 01:55:53.159 align:start position:0%
a call you got to come bail um Joe Smith
 
01:55:54.950 --> 01:55:54.960 align:start position:0%
and you before you even got there could
 
01:55:57.149 --> 01:55:57.159 align:start position:0%
call up Joe Smith's record and and know
 
01:55:59.589 --> 01:55:59.599 align:start position:0%
you know this is what I doesn't make any
 
01:56:01.910 --> 01:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
sense that you are allowed to have it
 
01:56:03.629 --> 01:56:03.639 align:start position:0%
but you can't have it unless I show it
 
01:56:05.470 --> 01:56:05.480 align:start position:0%
to you it does it seems we're
 
01:56:07.950 --> 01:56:07.960 align:start position:0%
hamstringing our own our own system yeah
 
01:56:10.950 --> 01:56:10.960 align:start position:0%
um any any questions for Miss
 
01:56:12.950 --> 01:56:12.960 align:start position:0%
LEF is there anything else you wanted to
 
01:56:15.350 --> 01:56:15.360 align:start position:0%
add uh no I know I think I've covered
 
01:56:17.310 --> 01:56:17.320 align:start position:0%
what I needed to cover so thank you very
 
01:56:19.830 --> 01:56:19.840 align:start position:0%
much I appreciate it thank you um next I
 
01:56:20.870 --> 01:56:20.880 align:start position:0%
don't know your name so I'm just going
 
01:56:22.550 --> 01:56:22.560 align:start position:0%
to say Madam bail commissioner until you
 
01:56:33.629 --> 01:56:33.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:37.270 --> 01:56:37.280 align:start position:0%
are uh my name is Judy cook I bail out
 
01:56:40.030 --> 01:56:40.040 align:start position:0%
of Milford District Court I've been a
 
01:56:42.350 --> 01:56:42.360 align:start position:0%
bail commissioner since
 
01:56:45.669 --> 01:56:45.679 align:start position:0%
1998 and I have gone through more
 
01:56:48.030 --> 01:56:48.040 align:start position:0%
iterations of being a bail commissioner
 
01:56:50.270 --> 01:56:50.280 align:start position:0%
than probably anyone else it's still a
 
01:56:50.280 --> 01:56:52.790 align:start position:0%
than probably anyone else it's still a
bail

01:56:52.790 --> 01:56:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:55.270 --> 01:56:55.280 align:start position:0%
commissioner what and by that you mean
 
01:56:57.790 --> 01:56:57.800 align:start position:0%
the laws have changed so many
 
01:57:02.270 --> 01:57:02.280 align:start position:0%
times um couple things um I have a
 
01:57:04.310 --> 01:57:04.320 align:start position:0%
suggestion to make to your
 
01:57:07.950 --> 01:57:07.960 align:start position:0%
committee um there is a website called
 
01:57:11.790 --> 01:57:11.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire judicial branch and then

forms

01:57:16.189 --> 01:57:16.199 align:start position:0%
forms
 
01:57:18.790 --> 01:57:18.800 align:start position:0%
and I think you would understand this
 
01:57:22.750 --> 01:57:22.760 align:start position:0%
process a lot better if you went on that
 
01:57:25.310 --> 01:57:25.320 align:start position:0%
website and
 
01:57:28.629 --> 01:57:28.639 align:start position:0%
downloaded the major forms that we use
 
01:57:31.550 --> 01:57:31.560 align:start position:0%
which are the circuit and Superior Court
 
01:57:31.560 --> 01:57:32.470 align:start position:0%
which are the circuit and Superior Court
bail

01:57:32.470 --> 01:57:32.480 align:start position:0%
bail
 
01:57:36.270 --> 01:57:36.280 align:start position:0%
orders um the cpb which is the criminal
 
01:57:39.030 --> 01:57:39.040 align:start position:0%
bail protective order uh the what you
 
01:57:41.910 --> 01:57:41.920 align:start position:0%
need to know form the request for an
 
01:57:44.629 --> 01:57:44.639 align:start position:0%
attorney form those uh and there's also
 
01:57:47.229 --> 01:57:47.239 align:start position:0%
the bond form those are the ones that we
 
01:57:50.350 --> 01:57:50.360 align:start position:0%
use there's a few others in there that
 
01:57:54.390 --> 01:57:54.400 align:start position:0%
are kind of obsolete at this point
 
01:57:57.149 --> 01:57:57.159 align:start position:0%
because you will then
 
01:58:00.709 --> 01:58:00.719 align:start position:0%
understand what we fill out and what
 
01:58:03.470 --> 01:58:03.480 align:start position:0%
information we have to get to fill these
 
01:58:03.480 --> 01:58:05.189 align:start position:0%
information we have to get to fill these
forms

01:58:05.189 --> 01:58:05.199 align:start position:0%
forms
 
01:58:09.870 --> 01:58:09.880 align:start position:0%
out um I've been doing telephonic baales
 
01:58:13.069 --> 01:58:13.079 align:start position:0%
since the beginning of coid and it
 
01:58:15.750 --> 01:58:15.760 align:start position:0%
became very clear to me that the police
 
01:58:18.430 --> 01:58:18.440 align:start position:0%
departments had no idea of what
 
01:58:20.910 --> 01:58:20.920 align:start position:0%
information the bail Commissioners
 
01:58:23.310 --> 01:58:23.320 align:start position:0%
needed so I developed this little
 
01:58:28.229 --> 01:58:28.239 align:start position:0%
two-page form that when they email me
 
01:58:29.830 --> 01:58:29.840 align:start position:0%
well first they call me and wake me up
 
01:58:32.470 --> 01:58:32.480 align:start position:0%
at like 3 in the morning and then I ask
 
01:58:35.229 --> 01:58:35.239 align:start position:0%
them to email me give them my email
 
01:58:39.830 --> 01:58:39.840 align:start position:0%
address with their arrest
 
01:58:42.750 --> 01:58:42.760 align:start position:0%
form so when I get
 
01:58:46.310 --> 01:58:46.320 align:start position:0%
that I send them a copy of this with the
 
01:58:49.350 --> 01:58:49.360 align:start position:0%
note any information that is not
 
01:58:51.310 --> 01:58:51.320 align:start position:0%
contained on your arrest
 
01:58:55.189 --> 01:58:55.199 align:start position:0%
form please fill it out or just put it
 
01:58:59.350 --> 01:58:59.360 align:start position:0%
in an email very simple I said the most
 
01:59:01.870 --> 01:59:01.880 align:start position:0%
important thing is is if it's District
 
01:59:04.950 --> 01:59:04.960 align:start position:0%
Court I need your court date because I
 
01:59:06.990 --> 01:59:07.000 align:start position:0%
don't have court dates for the whole
 
01:59:10.030 --> 01:59:10.040 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire I do for Superior
 
01:59:12.830 --> 01:59:12.840 align:start position:0%
Courts but not district
 
01:59:12.840 --> 01:59:14.870 align:start position:0%
Courts but not district
courts

01:59:14.870 --> 01:59:14.880 align:start position:0%
courts
 
01:59:17.510 --> 01:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
so that's kind of number one I think you
 
01:59:19.750 --> 01:59:19.760 align:start position:0%
will understand a lot more and once you
 
01:59:22.589 --> 01:59:22.599 align:start position:0%
read over because you seem to be focused
 
01:59:25.030 --> 01:59:25.040 align:start position:0%
in right now on domestic
 
01:59:29.030 --> 01:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
violence once you look at the criminal
 
01:59:31.950 --> 01:59:31.960 align:start position:0%
bail protective order you will perhaps
 
01:59:35.030 --> 01:59:35.040 align:start position:0%
understand better how the whole system
 
01:59:38.950 --> 01:59:38.960 align:start position:0%
works we fill out there's like a heading
 
01:59:43.030 --> 01:59:43.040 align:start position:0%
which is filled out by the court there's
 
01:59:44.669 --> 01:59:44.679 align:start position:0%
the whole rest of the form which is a
 
01:59:48.470 --> 01:59:48.480 align:start position:0%
four-page form that we fill out now if
 
01:59:50.470 --> 01:59:50.480 align:start position:0%
I'm doing it tell telephonically all
 
01:59:54.270 --> 01:59:54.280 align:start position:0%
these forms are available in PDF
 
01:59:57.910 --> 01:59:57.920 align:start position:0%
fillable forms so I will just sit down
 
02:00:00.910 --> 02:00:00.920 align:start position:0%
and I will fill them out as I
 
02:00:00.920 --> 02:00:03.790 align:start position:0%
and I will fill them out as I
go

02:00:03.790 --> 02:00:03.800 align:start position:0%
go
 
02:00:06.830 --> 02:00:06.840 align:start position:0%
um even if I'm at the police station
 
02:00:08.750 --> 02:00:08.760 align:start position:0%
sometimes and nobody's using the
 
02:00:10.510 --> 02:00:10.520 align:start position:0%
computer I'll do it that way because
 
02:00:12.669 --> 02:00:12.679 align:start position:0%
they can read the forms better than
 
02:00:14.870 --> 02:00:14.880 align:start position:0%
trying to read my handwriting at 3:00
 
02:00:14.880 --> 02:00:16.629 align:start position:0%
trying to read my handwriting at 3:00
a.m.

02:00:16.629 --> 02:00:16.639 align:start position:0%
a.m.
 
02:00:16.639 --> 02:00:18.149 align:start position:0%
a.m.
okay

02:00:18.149 --> 02:00:18.159 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:00:18.159 --> 02:00:20.229 align:start position:0%
okay
um

02:00:20.229 --> 02:00:20.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:23.310 --> 02:00:23.320 align:start position:0%
the only other question I or answer I
 
02:00:26.669 --> 02:00:26.679 align:start position:0%
would like to give you on the domestic
 
02:00:26.679 --> 02:00:27.830 align:start position:0%
would like to give you on the domestic
violence

02:00:27.830 --> 02:00:27.840 align:start position:0%
violence
 
02:00:31.350 --> 02:00:31.360 align:start position:0%
issue is I'm really not
 
02:00:33.430 --> 02:00:33.440 align:start position:0%
sure how
 
02:00:37.589 --> 02:00:37.599 align:start position:0%
much more a judge is going to be able to
 
02:00:37.599 --> 02:00:40.470 align:start position:0%
much more a judge is going to be able to
do

02:00:40.470 --> 02:00:40.480 align:start position:0%
do
 
02:00:43.709 --> 02:00:43.719 align:start position:0%
with with the perpetrator of domestic
 
02:00:48.830 --> 02:00:48.840 align:start position:0%
violence than I can do because a it's
 
02:00:51.470 --> 02:00:51.480 align:start position:0%
going to be a longer period of time as
 
02:00:51.480 --> 02:00:53.069 align:start position:0%
going to be a longer period of time as
Trixie

02:00:53.069 --> 02:00:53.079 align:start position:0%
Trixie
 
02:00:57.310 --> 02:00:57.320 align:start position:0%
said and B when I when I see and I see
 
02:01:00.709 --> 02:01:00.719 align:start position:0%
domestic violence all the time in my
 
02:01:02.870 --> 02:01:02.880 align:start position:0%
work as a bail
 
02:01:06.910 --> 02:01:06.920 align:start position:0%
commissioner I make absolutely sure that
 
02:01:10.830 --> 02:01:10.840 align:start position:0%
they understand that if they transgress
 
02:01:14.149 --> 02:01:14.159 align:start position:0%
any of any of the things and I read
 
02:01:16.310 --> 02:01:16.320 align:start position:0%
every single bit of each form to them
 
02:01:18.669 --> 02:01:18.679 align:start position:0%
because half the time alcohol plays a
 
02:01:22.390 --> 02:01:22.400 align:start position:0%
big role and I'm really not sure that
 
02:01:24.950 --> 02:01:24.960 align:start position:0%
they're going to be able to read this
 
02:01:27.709 --> 02:01:27.719 align:start position:0%
and I stress the points about no
 
02:01:29.990 --> 02:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
communication and all the different ways
 
02:01:31.510 --> 02:01:31.520 align:start position:0%
they are not going to
 
02:01:34.229 --> 02:01:34.239 align:start position:0%
communicate and then at the end I tell
 
02:01:38.149 --> 02:01:38.159 align:start position:0%
them if you find it necessary to go back
 
02:01:39.270 --> 02:01:39.280 align:start position:0%
to that
 
02:01:42.390 --> 02:01:42.400 align:start position:0%
residence because your car is there or
 
02:01:45.030 --> 02:01:45.040 align:start position:0%
your clothing is there or your dog is
 
02:01:45.040 --> 02:01:46.550 align:start position:0%
your clothing is there or your dog is
there

02:01:46.550 --> 02:01:46.560 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:01:50.069 --> 02:01:50.079 align:start position:0%
whatever you ask the police police
 
02:01:54.069 --> 02:01:54.079 align:start position:0%
officer to accompany you and that is the
 
02:01:55.790 --> 02:01:55.800 align:start position:0%
only time that you were going to go back
 
02:01:58.229 --> 02:01:58.239 align:start position:0%
to that residence until you are seen in
 
02:02:01.950 --> 02:02:01.960 align:start position:0%
court and the court trial whatever is
 
02:02:04.990 --> 02:02:05.000 align:start position:0%
finished and I I don't know that too
 
02:02:07.510 --> 02:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
many of mine have transgressed that I've
 
02:02:10.550 --> 02:02:10.560 align:start position:0%
never heard back from the court that you
 
02:02:13.510 --> 02:02:13.520 align:start position:0%
know and I I kind of keep an eye on my
 
02:02:16.510 --> 02:02:16.520 align:start position:0%
court um especially the one that's my
 
02:02:16.520 --> 02:02:17.589 align:start position:0%
court um especially the one that's my
home

02:02:17.589 --> 02:02:17.599 align:start position:0%
home
 
02:02:22.189 --> 02:02:22.199 align:start position:0%
court but you know I mean i' I I had one
 
02:02:25.629 --> 02:02:25.639 align:start position:0%
in Hudson one time when I was bailing
 
02:02:29.830 --> 02:02:29.840 align:start position:0%
over there and it was this kid and
 
02:02:34.350 --> 02:02:34.360 align:start position:0%
he' his girlfriend told him bye-bye and
 
02:02:36.629 --> 02:02:36.639 align:start position:0%
so he threw her into the bathroom and
 
02:02:37.950 --> 02:02:37.960 align:start position:0%
nailed the door
 
02:02:42.149 --> 02:02:42.159 align:start position:0%
shut okay so she's yelling out the
 
02:02:44.790 --> 02:02:44.800 align:start position:0%
window the police come they release her
 
02:02:46.589 --> 02:02:46.599 align:start position:0%
they bring him to be
 
02:02:50.950 --> 02:02:50.960 align:start position:0%
bailed I at that point in time it was um
 
02:02:50.960 --> 02:02:52.270 align:start position:0%
bailed I at that point in time it was um
bail

02:02:52.270 --> 02:02:52.280 align:start position:0%
bail
 
02:02:55.510 --> 02:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
reform and no cash bail because we were
 
02:02:57.950 --> 02:02:57.960 align:start position:0%
actually told that about five or six
 
02:03:02.430 --> 02:03:02.440 align:start position:0%
years ago when that started okay so I
 
02:03:04.390 --> 02:03:04.400 align:start position:0%
couldn't give him a cash
 
02:03:08.390 --> 02:03:08.400 align:start position:0%
bail and I wasn't going to detain
 
02:03:11.950 --> 02:03:11.960 align:start position:0%
him so I gave him the paperwork I pr him
 
02:03:13.149 --> 02:03:13.159 align:start position:0%
gave him the
 
02:03:16.030 --> 02:03:16.040 align:start position:0%
paperwork he went right out the door
 
02:03:18.109 --> 02:03:18.119 align:start position:0%
depositing my paperwork in the circular
 
02:03:20.830 --> 02:03:20.840 align:start position:0%
file on his way out went back to the
 
02:03:23.310 --> 02:03:23.320 align:start position:0%
apartment grabbed her again because she
 
02:03:23.320 --> 02:03:24.229 align:start position:0%
apartment grabbed her again because she
hadn't

02:03:24.229 --> 02:03:24.239 align:start position:0%
hadn't
 
02:03:26.510 --> 02:03:26.520 align:start position:0%
left and tried to do the same thing
 
02:03:29.470 --> 02:03:29.480 align:start position:0%
again now the police were on to him they
 
02:03:31.950 --> 02:03:31.960 align:start position:0%
followed him back there he didn't even
 
02:03:33.510 --> 02:03:33.520 align:start position:0%
get so far as
 
02:03:37.589 --> 02:03:37.599 align:start position:0%
to enter the apartment and
 
02:03:41.589 --> 02:03:41.599 align:start position:0%
they arrested him again for I guess
 
02:03:44.990 --> 02:03:45.000 align:start position:0%
stalking was the crime that time and so
 
02:03:46.390 --> 02:03:46.400 align:start position:0%
I asked him I
 
02:03:48.870 --> 02:03:48.880 align:start position:0%
said why did you throw the paperwork
 
02:03:51.030 --> 02:03:51.040 align:start position:0%
work in the in the trash as you were
 
02:03:54.109 --> 02:03:54.119 align:start position:0%
leaving the the police station he said
 
02:03:55.870 --> 02:03:55.880 align:start position:0%
oh well I wasn't going to go to court
 
02:03:57.549 --> 02:03:57.559 align:start position:0%
anyway I mean you can't tell me what to
 
02:03:59.669 --> 02:03:59.679 align:start position:0%
do you're never going to be a judge
 
02:04:01.149 --> 02:04:01.159 align:start position:0%
isn't going to be able to tell that
 
02:04:01.159 --> 02:04:02.430 align:start position:0%
isn't going to be able to tell that
person

02:04:02.430 --> 02:04:02.440 align:start position:0%
person
 
02:04:05.149 --> 02:04:05.159 align:start position:0%
anything you know and I don't really see
 
02:04:07.030 --> 02:04:07.040 align:start position:0%
the difference between what bail
 
02:04:11.350 --> 02:04:11.360 align:start position:0%
Commissioners do now and what judges do
 
02:04:13.189 --> 02:04:13.199 align:start position:0%
except that we do it quicker because
 
02:04:15.589 --> 02:04:15.599 align:start position:0%
we're 247
 
02:04:19.549 --> 02:04:19.559 align:start position:0%
365 and if you rely on court time from
 
02:04:21.189 --> 02:04:21.199 align:start position:0%
8:00 a.m. to
 
02:04:23.470 --> 02:04:23.480 align:start position:0%
4: what are you going to do with all the
 
02:04:26.790 --> 02:04:26.800 align:start position:0%
rest of that I have two towns in Milford
 
02:04:29.990 --> 02:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
District Court area that when I go to
 
02:04:32.629 --> 02:04:32.639 align:start position:0%
bail people there there is a
 
02:04:36.350 --> 02:04:36.360 align:start position:0%
bench in the chief's office there is a
 
02:04:41.470 --> 02:04:41.480 align:start position:0%
radiator with a steam pipe and the the
 
02:04:44.669 --> 02:04:44.679 align:start position:0%
defendant is Shackled to the to the
 
02:04:49.030 --> 02:04:49.040 align:start position:0%
steam pipe and you know I have to bail
 
02:04:52.149 --> 02:04:52.159 align:start position:0%
him that way they usually do it with his
 
02:04:55.910 --> 02:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
non-dominant hands so he can sign the
 
02:04:58.990 --> 02:04:59.000 align:start position:0%
paperwork but I mean they're lucky they
 
02:05:01.910 --> 02:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
have a computer in that police station
 
02:05:06.629 --> 02:05:06.639 align:start position:0%
and if you look at the sort of Kinds Of
 
02:05:09.669 --> 02:05:09.679 align:start position:0%
Towns New Hampshire has especially up
 
02:05:13.270 --> 02:05:13.280 align:start position:0%
north you're you're lucky to have a room
 
02:05:14.709 --> 02:05:14.719 align:start position:0%
for the police
 
02:05:17.149 --> 02:05:17.159 align:start position:0%
station much
 
02:05:22.189 --> 02:05:22.199 align:start position:0%
less sell holding cells booking areas I
 
02:05:25.950 --> 02:05:25.960 align:start position:0%
mean those are things that
 
02:05:29.350 --> 02:05:29.360 align:start position:0%
medium sized towns sometimes don't even
 
02:05:32.870 --> 02:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
have you know my town I live in Brooklyn
 
02:05:34.790 --> 02:05:34.800 align:start position:0%
and and my town only got a police
 
02:05:34.800 --> 02:05:36.669 align:start position:0%
and and my town only got a police
station

02:05:36.669 --> 02:05:36.679 align:start position:0%
station
 
02:05:40.790 --> 02:05:40.800 align:start position:0%
probably maybe 15 years
 
02:05:44.669 --> 02:05:44.679 align:start position:0%
ago and it's been revised since
 
02:05:47.669 --> 02:05:47.679 align:start position:0%
then but I I think you know you have to
 
02:05:50.629 --> 02:05:50.639 align:start position:0%
understand what what we do because I
 
02:05:52.990 --> 02:05:53.000 align:start position:0%
really I think only Mr Psyduck really
 
02:05:55.270 --> 02:05:55.280 align:start position:0%
knows what we do the these aren't those
 
02:05:57.510 --> 02:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
p p papers but it would might be helpful
 
02:05:59.790 --> 02:05:59.800 align:start position:0%
for us to see your what you made if if
 
02:06:01.270 --> 02:06:01.280 align:start position:0%
you if you want to share it you don't
 
02:06:04.750 --> 02:06:04.760 align:start position:0%
have to no it's fine um I'll bring it up
 
02:06:07.030 --> 02:06:07.040 align:start position:0%
when I'm you can just hand it to Mr
 
02:06:10.069 --> 02:06:10.079 align:start position:0%
s you know I keep track I keep good
 
02:06:14.030 --> 02:06:14.040 align:start position:0%
track of my bails whether I who I bail
 
02:06:17.270 --> 02:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
whether I'm paid what courts they go to
 
02:06:20.149 --> 02:06:20.159 align:start position:0%
and right now now
 
02:06:23.910 --> 02:06:23.920 align:start position:0%
um I do a I do a lot of telephonic
 
02:06:27.669 --> 02:06:27.679 align:start position:0%
bailes because I'm willing to do that
 
02:06:29.990 --> 02:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
and I'm
 
02:06:33.870 --> 02:06:33.880 align:start position:0%
running less than 50% on fees
 
02:06:36.229 --> 02:06:36.239 align:start position:0%
collected because of the telephonic
 
02:06:39.950 --> 02:06:39.960 align:start position:0%
bails I don't want to take square or any
 
02:06:42.350 --> 02:06:42.360 align:start position:0%
of those other electronic means of
 
02:06:44.830 --> 02:06:44.840 align:start position:0%
getting cash from people because all
 
02:06:46.510 --> 02:06:46.520 align:start position:0%
they have to do is they walk out the
 
02:06:49.229 --> 02:06:49.239 align:start position:0%
door and they can cancel that
 
02:06:53.069 --> 02:06:53.079 align:start position:0%
so I would rather and we were told
 
02:06:58.109 --> 02:06:58.119 align:start position:0%
probably before coid uh judge king sort
 
02:07:01.310 --> 02:07:01.320 align:start position:0%
of told us that we
 
02:07:01.320 --> 02:07:03.350 align:start position:0%
of told us that we
would

02:07:03.350 --> 02:07:03.360 align:start position:0%
would
 
02:07:06.709 --> 02:07:06.719 align:start position:0%
um if if we noted on our bail paperwork
 
02:07:08.430 --> 02:07:08.440 align:start position:0%
that we weren't paid that the courts
 
02:07:10.470 --> 02:07:10.480 align:start position:0%
would try to collect that for
 
02:07:14.069 --> 02:07:14.079 align:start position:0%
us and they've been very good about
 
02:07:16.470 --> 02:07:16.480 align:start position:0%
doing that
 
02:07:19.390 --> 02:07:19.400 align:start position:0%
um but I have to
 
02:07:22.069 --> 02:07:22.079 align:start position:0%
I have to make a a big asterisk on the
 
02:07:23.750 --> 02:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
part because they they've put another
 
02:07:28.030 --> 02:07:28.040 align:start position:0%
little line there that says bail fee $40
 
02:07:30.470 --> 02:07:30.480 align:start position:0%
paid unpaid other
 
02:07:33.270 --> 02:07:33.280 align:start position:0%
arrangements and then I write in there
 
02:07:35.510 --> 02:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
you know pay at
 
02:07:39.030 --> 02:07:39.040 align:start position:0%
court and I've been collecting because
 
02:07:41.510 --> 02:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
of doing that but Milford district court
 
02:07:43.830 --> 02:07:43.840 align:start position:0%
has always done that they've always been
 
02:07:47.270 --> 02:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
very good about collecting but out of my
 
02:07:49.910 --> 02:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
22 Superior Court bails I've done this
 
02:07:52.310 --> 02:07:52.320 align:start position:0%
year only one has
 
02:07:55.149 --> 02:07:55.159 align:start position:0%
paid which I find very
 
02:07:57.549 --> 02:07:57.559 align:start position:0%
disappointing you um you you said you
 
02:08:00.430 --> 02:08:00.440 align:start position:0%
were less than 50% total is is that
 
02:08:03.109 --> 02:08:03.119 align:start position:0%
total so Milford Court's good but some
 
02:08:04.830 --> 02:08:04.840 align:start position:0%
of the others not so much I'm talking
 
02:08:08.549 --> 02:08:08.559 align:start position:0%
about circuit core level right
 
02:08:11.030 --> 02:08:11.040 align:start position:0%
um Portsmouth has been pretty good
 
02:08:13.390 --> 02:08:13.400 align:start position:0%
Manchester's starting to get
 
02:08:13.400 --> 02:08:15.750 align:start position:0%
Manchester's starting to get
good

02:08:15.750 --> 02:08:15.760 align:start position:0%
good
 
02:08:19.549 --> 02:08:19.559 align:start position:0%
um Dover I've had money from
 
02:08:22.229 --> 02:08:22.239 align:start position:0%
them um but other than the Milford
 
02:08:24.149 --> 02:08:24.159 align:start position:0%
district court
 
02:08:27.470 --> 02:08:27.480 align:start position:0%
and I usually don't do
 
02:08:32.109 --> 02:08:32.119 align:start position:0%
gtown or miramac which are in that
 
02:08:35.669 --> 02:08:35.679 align:start position:0%
circuit um because they have bail
 
02:08:40.109 --> 02:08:40.119 align:start position:0%
Commissioners right now I'm 77 years old
 
02:08:44.470 --> 02:08:44.480 align:start position:0%
and it's me and Dick cave who's 90 and
 
02:08:45.870 --> 02:08:45.880 align:start position:0%
we are the two bail Commissioners in
 
02:08:48.149 --> 02:08:48.159 align:start position:0%
Milford district court and Dick can't
 
02:08:50.350 --> 02:08:50.360 align:start position:0%
drive drive at night
 
02:08:52.589 --> 02:08:52.599 align:start position:0%
so guess
 
02:08:57.950 --> 02:08:57.960 align:start position:0%
who you know but I I it it's not only
 
02:09:01.950 --> 02:09:01.960 align:start position:0%
that it's very unattractive to try to
 
02:09:04.790 --> 02:09:04.800 align:start position:0%
recruit people to be bail Commissioners
 
02:09:06.430 --> 02:09:06.440 align:start position:0%
when they find out you get paid about
 
02:09:08.189 --> 02:09:08.199 align:start position:0%
50% of the
 
02:09:11.549 --> 02:09:11.559 align:start position:0%
time and you have a limited supply of
 
02:09:13.990 --> 02:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
people because people with full-time
 
02:09:16.109 --> 02:09:16.119 align:start position:0%
jobs aren't going to want to do this
 
02:09:17.430 --> 02:09:17.440 align:start position:0%
because they don't want to be up all
 
02:09:20.310 --> 02:09:20.320 align:start position:0%
night and they have a job during the day
 
02:09:22.430 --> 02:09:22.440 align:start position:0%
so you're going to
 
02:09:22.440 --> 02:09:24.470 align:start position:0%
so you're going to
have

02:09:24.470 --> 02:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:09:27.629 --> 02:09:27.639 align:start position:0%
retirees people that are self-employed
 
02:09:30.270 --> 02:09:30.280 align:start position:0%
that have the kind of self-employed jobs
 
02:09:33.229 --> 02:09:33.239 align:start position:0%
that they can run off and be a fireman
 
02:09:34.510 --> 02:09:34.520 align:start position:0%
or a
 
02:09:37.390 --> 02:09:37.400 align:start position:0%
whatever you know it's a volunteer job
 
02:09:41.990 --> 02:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
sort of just like your jobs but our jobs
 
02:09:45.030 --> 02:09:45.040 align:start position:0%
involve a lot more
 
02:09:49.030 --> 02:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
travel um you know I spent one whole day
 
02:09:51.669 --> 02:09:51.679 align:start position:0%
I did a a good thing and you know how
 
02:09:53.589 --> 02:09:53.599 align:start position:0%
good things are they always come back to
 
02:09:53.599 --> 02:09:54.430 align:start position:0%
good things are they always come back to
bite

02:09:54.430 --> 02:09:54.440 align:start position:0%
bite
 
02:09:58.430 --> 02:09:58.440 align:start position:0%
you I got two calls from Manchester one
 
02:10:02.589 --> 02:10:02.599 align:start position:0%
night around 3 in the morning that they
 
02:10:07.549 --> 02:10:07.559 align:start position:0%
had an arreste that had cash bail on an
 
02:10:09.549 --> 02:10:09.559 align:start position:0%
electronic bench warrant and they
 
02:10:11.390 --> 02:10:11.400 align:start position:0%
couldn't find a bail commissioner and
 
02:10:13.069 --> 02:10:13.079 align:start position:0%
they needed a bail commissioner to go
 
02:10:14.149 --> 02:10:14.159 align:start position:0%
pick up that
 
02:10:18.510 --> 02:10:18.520 align:start position:0%
money okay so finally the second time
 
02:10:20.830 --> 02:10:20.840 align:start position:0%
they called I said all right I will
 
02:10:23.270 --> 02:10:23.280 align:start position:0%
drive up to Manchester and I will bail
 
02:10:28.629 --> 02:10:28.639 align:start position:0%
this guy I get up there he has three
 
02:10:33.470 --> 02:10:33.480 align:start position:0%
Cash Bales out of North
 
02:10:37.629 --> 02:10:37.639 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro out of miramac which is
 
02:10:41.109 --> 02:10:41.119 align:start position:0%
conquered and one out of um it was
 
02:10:44.510 --> 02:10:44.520 align:start position:0%
supposed on the on the electronic bench
 
02:10:46.149 --> 02:10:46.159 align:start position:0%
warrant we get which are very hard to
 
02:10:50.430 --> 02:10:50.440 align:start position:0%
read to begin with it said it was out of
 
02:10:52.910 --> 02:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
Auburn so there's no Auburn district
 
02:10:54.350 --> 02:10:54.360 align:start position:0%
court now it's
 
02:10:57.470 --> 02:10:57.480 align:start position:0%
Candia okay so I go to
 
02:11:00.350 --> 02:11:00.360 align:start position:0%
Candia and The woman there the clerk she
 
02:11:02.310 --> 02:11:02.320 align:start position:0%
says oh well we're only doing civil
 
02:11:05.149 --> 02:11:05.159 align:start position:0%
cases now you'll have to go to
 
02:11:08.310 --> 02:11:08.320 align:start position:0%
Dairy so I truck myself down to
 
02:11:11.310 --> 02:11:11.320 align:start position:0%
Dairy and they don't want to take the
 
02:11:12.990 --> 02:11:13.000 align:start position:0%
money because it's
 
02:11:16.069 --> 02:11:16.079 align:start position:0%
says Auburn which is now Candia and I
 
02:11:18.790 --> 02:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
said but the clerk in Candia told me to
 
02:11:21.709 --> 02:11:21.719 align:start position:0%
give it to you so finally she took the
 
02:11:24.750 --> 02:11:24.760 align:start position:0%
money but you know it's like that was a
 
02:11:27.350 --> 02:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
whole day my whole Monday was totally
 
02:11:31.430 --> 02:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
shot trying to get rid of $1,200 worth
 
02:11:35.229 --> 02:11:35.239 align:start position:0%
of there were two 500s and a
 
02:11:38.069 --> 02:11:38.079 align:start position:0%
200 you know I mean it's not like we're
 
02:11:38.079 --> 02:11:39.229 align:start position:0%
200 you know I mean it's not like we're
having

02:11:39.229 --> 02:11:39.239 align:start position:0%
having
 
02:11:42.589 --> 02:11:42.599 align:start position:0%
fun and I don't know any Veil
 
02:11:46.270 --> 02:11:46.280 align:start position:0%
commissioner that hasn't been
 
02:11:49.350 --> 02:11:49.360 align:start position:0%
trained um
 
02:11:51.189 --> 02:11:51.199 align:start position:0%
I mean we get trained once a year at
 
02:11:53.750 --> 02:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
court that's kind of like a catchup they
 
02:11:57.109 --> 02:11:57.119 align:start position:0%
now require people to Shadow another
 
02:11:58.790 --> 02:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
bail commissioner for a certain amount
 
02:11:58.800 --> 02:11:59.750 align:start position:0%
bail commissioner for a certain amount
of

02:11:59.750 --> 02:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:12:02.750 --> 02:12:02.760 align:start position:0%
time um when I started this I was just
 
02:12:04.109 --> 02:12:04.119 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
02:12:07.069 --> 02:12:07.079 align:start position:0%
handed my predecessor's bail bag with
 
02:12:11.430 --> 02:12:11.440 align:start position:0%
some forms in it and a few of their bail
 
02:12:15.669 --> 02:12:15.679 align:start position:0%
forms that they' filled out and said do
 
02:12:18.390 --> 02:12:18.400 align:start position:0%
it you know and I had to kind of self
 
02:12:20.950 --> 02:12:20.960 align:start position:0%
Trin Myself by talking to the police
 
02:12:24.990 --> 02:12:25.000 align:start position:0%
departments and talking to the court so
 
02:12:27.189 --> 02:12:27.199 align:start position:0%
you know you guys are the ones that are
 
02:12:29.430 --> 02:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
making the rules we're the ones that are
 
02:12:31.149 --> 02:12:31.159 align:start position:0%
following them and I don't know anybody
 
02:12:34.549 --> 02:12:34.559 align:start position:0%
that's not following them and not only
 
02:12:34.559 --> 02:12:36.030 align:start position:0%
that's not following them and not only
because

02:12:36.030 --> 02:12:36.040 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:12:39.229 --> 02:12:39.239 align:start position:0%
of I fax
 
02:12:41.990 --> 02:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
everything and not only do I fax it
 
02:12:45.470 --> 02:12:45.480 align:start position:0%
because I'm I'm never sure of the facts
 
02:12:47.629 --> 02:12:47.639 align:start position:0%
okay I stick it in the mail too so
 
02:12:49.270 --> 02:12:49.280 align:start position:0%
they're going to get two copies of
 
02:12:50.750 --> 02:12:50.760 align:start position:0%
everything that I
 
02:12:54.950 --> 02:12:54.960 align:start position:0%
do so you know I don't know how much how
 
02:12:58.790 --> 02:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
much better we could be doing it um on
 
02:13:01.549 --> 02:13:01.559 align:start position:0%
the criminal bail protective order Karen
 
02:13:04.790 --> 02:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
Gorman from Superior Court she did a
 
02:13:06.229 --> 02:13:06.239 align:start position:0%
whole training
 
02:13:08.950 --> 02:13:08.960 align:start position:0%
session in each of the Superior Courts
 
02:13:13.950 --> 02:13:13.960 align:start position:0%
for those catchman areas around them um
 
02:13:17.030 --> 02:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
all about that so I I just don't know
 
02:13:21.589 --> 02:13:21.599 align:start position:0%
what more can be done done if I could um
 
02:13:24.109 --> 02:13:24.119 align:start position:0%
I know in previous legislatures um the
 
02:13:26.109 --> 02:13:26.119 align:start position:0%
bail Commissioners have have come under
 
02:13:28.950 --> 02:13:28.960 align:start position:0%
attack and I feel like um a little bit
 
02:13:30.990 --> 02:13:31.000 align:start position:0%
of your testimony is defensive and it
 
02:13:32.350 --> 02:13:32.360 align:start position:0%
needn't be because I don't believe
 
02:13:33.990 --> 02:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
anyone in this committee blames Bill
 
02:13:35.830 --> 02:13:35.840 align:start position:0%
Commissioners or what's going on here
 
02:13:37.870 --> 02:13:37.880 align:start position:0%
you are doing what we told you to do we
 
02:13:39.470 --> 02:13:39.480 align:start position:0%
just don't think what we told you to do
 
02:13:42.350 --> 02:13:42.360 align:start position:0%
was the right the right way to do it so
 
02:13:44.709 --> 02:13:44.719 align:start position:0%
we want your input so that this time
 
02:13:47.470 --> 02:13:47.480 align:start position:0%
it's done right and we understand so I
 
02:13:48.830 --> 02:13:48.840 align:start position:0%
appreciate you you pointing us to those
 
02:13:51.750 --> 02:13:51.760 align:start position:0%
forms and we make your job easier and
 
02:13:55.109 --> 02:13:55.119 align:start position:0%
not harder um at at the same time as we
 
02:13:57.669 --> 02:13:57.679 align:start position:0%
take into account the whole the whole
 
02:14:00.030 --> 02:14:00.040 align:start position:0%
system globally um because it's not just
 
02:14:01.589 --> 02:14:01.599 align:start position:0%
B Commissioners to your point it's the
 
02:14:03.430 --> 02:14:03.440 align:start position:0%
courts it's probation it's parole it's
 
02:14:06.310 --> 02:14:06.320 align:start position:0%
police it's we're dealing with u it's
 
02:14:08.589 --> 02:14:08.599 align:start position:0%
defense Council we're dealing and and
 
02:14:11.229 --> 02:14:11.239 align:start position:0%
also very importantly it's the defendant
 
02:14:14.390 --> 02:14:14.400 align:start position:0%
um in in victims so there's so many
 
02:14:17.030 --> 02:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
aspects to this which is why this time
 
02:14:18.790 --> 02:14:18.800 align:start position:0%
we decided we were going to look at it
 
02:14:20.549 --> 02:14:20.559 align:start position:0%
holistically instead of trying to patch
 
02:14:22.270 --> 02:14:22.280 align:start position:0%
all these little leaks we're going to
 
02:14:25.030 --> 02:14:25.040 align:start position:0%
fix it and and so I appreciate it I just
 
02:14:26.549 --> 02:14:26.559 align:start position:0%
don't want you to feel or any other Bill
 
02:14:29.149 --> 02:14:29.159 align:start position:0%
commissioner to feel like this committee
 
02:14:30.910 --> 02:14:30.920 align:start position:0%
feels like any of this is the bill
 
02:14:33.430 --> 02:14:33.440 align:start position:0%
commissioner's fault at all I I just
 
02:14:36.149 --> 02:14:36.159 align:start position:0%
want to leave you with one thought that
 
02:14:38.310 --> 02:14:38.320 align:start position:0%
I've come to this conclusion over years
 
02:14:39.430 --> 02:14:39.440 align:start position:0%
of doing
 
02:14:43.990 --> 02:14:44.000 align:start position:0%
this and it it happened when bail reform
 
02:14:46.870 --> 02:14:46.880 align:start position:0%
first started to come into New
 
02:14:49.870 --> 02:14:49.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I thought to myself
 
02:14:53.589 --> 02:14:53.599 align:start position:0%
because I'm I'm a child of my father
 
02:14:55.390 --> 02:14:55.400 align:start position:0%
being in the military and moving every
 
02:14:57.390 --> 02:14:57.400 align:start position:0%
two years so I've lived everywhere in
 
02:14:57.400 --> 02:14:58.510 align:start position:0%
two years so I've lived everywhere in
this

02:14:58.510 --> 02:14:58.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:14:58.520 --> 02:15:00.189 align:start position:0%
this
country

02:15:00.189 --> 02:15:00.199 align:start position:0%
country
 
02:15:05.549 --> 02:15:05.559 align:start position:0%
and the south is not noted for its
 
02:15:08.510 --> 02:15:08.520 align:start position:0%
fairness shall we say in judicial kinds
 
02:15:08.520 --> 02:15:09.589 align:start position:0%
fairness shall we say in judicial kinds
of

02:15:09.589 --> 02:15:09.599 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:15:13.430 --> 02:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
things the north has been a lot more
 
02:15:15.669 --> 02:15:15.679 align:start position:0%
kind I think over the
 
02:15:18.510 --> 02:15:18.520 align:start position:0%
years but I think new Hampshire when
 
02:15:22.030 --> 02:15:22.040 align:start position:0%
they brought in the bail reform they
 
02:15:23.950 --> 02:15:23.960 align:start position:0%
were fixing a problem that we didn't
 
02:15:27.189 --> 02:15:27.199 align:start position:0%
have we might have had one or two
 
02:15:30.990 --> 02:15:31.000 align:start position:0%
examples of the problem but it wasn't a
 
02:15:35.069 --> 02:15:35.079 align:start position:0%
widespread thing that was polluting our
 
02:15:38.870 --> 02:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
state and all it did
 
02:15:42.950 --> 02:15:42.960 align:start position:0%
was um create a problem that we didn't
 
02:15:45.270 --> 02:15:45.280 align:start position:0%
have and I really don't want your
 
02:15:48.270 --> 02:15:48.280 align:start position:0%
committee to be creating problem s that
 
02:15:50.950 --> 02:15:50.960 align:start position:0%
we don't have and solving them with
 
02:15:53.030 --> 02:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
things that only become
 
02:15:56.229 --> 02:15:56.239 align:start position:0%
problems because I think an example of
 
02:15:59.109 --> 02:15:59.119 align:start position:0%
that was felony first which they are now
 
02:16:00.950 --> 02:16:00.960 align:start position:0%
getting rid of in
 
02:16:03.470 --> 02:16:03.480 align:start position:0%
January that was a problem that didn't
 
02:16:07.109 --> 02:16:07.119 align:start position:0%
need fixing and it got fixed in a way
 
02:16:10.109 --> 02:16:10.119 align:start position:0%
that it only caused more confusion and
 
02:16:11.790 --> 02:16:11.800 align:start position:0%
now they're going to throw it
 
02:16:15.189 --> 02:16:15.199 align:start position:0%
out you know so I just think think hard
 
02:16:17.390 --> 02:16:17.400 align:start position:0%
about what you're you're doing because
 
02:16:19.709 --> 02:16:19.719 align:start position:0%
the ramifications of it
 
02:16:22.870 --> 02:16:22.880 align:start position:0%
are any change little change that gets
 
02:16:25.830 --> 02:16:25.840 align:start position:0%
made is a ramification that can grow
 
02:16:29.310 --> 02:16:29.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:31.870 --> 02:16:31.880 align:start position:0%
problem and I I appreciate that and I
 
02:16:33.150 --> 02:16:33.160 align:start position:0%
think every member of this committee
 
02:16:35.669 --> 02:16:35.679 align:start position:0%
does as well we understand that ripples
 
02:16:37.950 --> 02:16:37.960 align:start position:0%
in that pond um I believe we have a
 
02:16:39.309 --> 02:16:39.319 align:start position:0%
question before you just really quickly
 
02:16:40.750 --> 02:16:40.760 align:start position:0%
I don't have a question just a comment
 
02:16:42.790 --> 02:16:42.800 align:start position:0%
for you miss cook I just wanted to say
 
02:16:44.629 --> 02:16:44.639 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony and your
 
02:16:45.950 --> 02:16:45.960 align:start position:0%
experience and your wisdom and bringing
 
02:16:47.190 --> 02:16:47.200 align:start position:0%
it before our committee I really
 
02:16:49.150 --> 02:16:49.160 align:start position:0%
appreciate you and your time that you
 
02:16:51.230 --> 02:16:51.240 align:start position:0%
have spent being a bail commissioner
 
02:16:53.910 --> 02:16:53.920 align:start position:0%
here in our state it's a volunteer role
 
02:16:56.270 --> 02:16:56.280 align:start position:0%
more so than what we do here I mean all
 
02:16:57.990 --> 02:16:58.000 align:start position:0%
we do here is sit at a table and ask
 
02:17:00.270 --> 02:17:00.280 align:start position:0%
questions you're on the ground actually
 
02:17:01.910 --> 02:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
doing the work and I really appreciate
 
02:17:03.469 --> 02:17:03.479 align:start position:0%
you doing that so I just wanted to say
 
02:17:06.469 --> 02:17:06.479 align:start position:0%
thank you but don't forget you might be
 
02:17:08.469 --> 02:17:08.479 align:start position:0%
volunteers that are sitting at the table
 
02:17:11.389 --> 02:17:11.399 align:start position:0%
asking questions but the outcome of what
 
02:17:15.750 --> 02:17:15.760 align:start position:0%
you do is what affects everybody in this
 
02:17:19.150 --> 02:17:19.160 align:start position:0%
state because it will somehow become a
 
02:17:22.709 --> 02:17:22.719 align:start position:0%
rule or an RSA or something that is
 
02:17:24.910 --> 02:17:24.920 align:start position:0%
going to
 
02:17:27.389 --> 02:17:27.399 align:start position:0%
cause a trickle down
 
02:17:31.309 --> 02:17:31.319 align:start position:0%
effect and it'll land in my lap and we
 
02:17:33.070 --> 02:17:33.080 align:start position:0%
appreciate that thank you very much for
 
02:17:37.509 --> 02:17:37.519 align:start position:0%
your testimony yeah yes uh go
 
02:17:39.629 --> 02:17:39.639 align:start position:0%
ahead thank you for taking my question
 
02:17:40.990 --> 02:17:41.000 align:start position:0%
you touched on something that I wanted
 
02:17:43.150 --> 02:17:43.160 align:start position:0%
to ask and clarify is there any
 
02:17:44.790 --> 02:17:44.800 align:start position:0%
direction given by either judicial
 
02:17:46.429 --> 02:17:46.439 align:start position:0%
branch or by the district court that you
 
02:17:48.709 --> 02:17:48.719 align:start position:0%
work for involving uh parameters of
 
02:17:50.469 --> 02:17:50.479 align:start position:0%
which you set bail on somebody who is
 
02:17:53.790 --> 02:17:53.800 align:start position:0%
intoxicated with either drugs or and or
 
02:17:56.429 --> 02:17:56.439 align:start position:0%
alcohol like what we do with them how we
 
02:17:57.709 --> 02:17:57.719 align:start position:0%
bail them like if somebody's picked up
 
02:18:00.709 --> 02:18:00.719 align:start position:0%
and they're determined to be say DWI and
 
02:18:04.150 --> 02:18:04.160 align:start position:0%
it's a uh say a Class A misdemeanor is
 
02:18:05.509 --> 02:18:05.519 align:start position:0%
there a level of intoxication that you
 
02:18:07.429 --> 02:18:07.439 align:start position:0%
will not set bail on and they need to go
 
02:18:09.030 --> 02:18:09.040 align:start position:0%
sober up before you'll set bail or do
 
02:18:13.190 --> 02:18:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:16.589 --> 02:18:16.599 align:start position:0%
gate well I have to set bail that's why
 
02:18:17.830 --> 02:18:17.840 align:start position:0%
I've been called to the police police
 
02:18:21.830 --> 02:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
department but usually on on arrests
 
02:18:21.840 --> 02:18:23.070 align:start position:0%
department but usually on on arrests
like

02:18:23.070 --> 02:18:23.080 align:start position:0%
like
 
02:18:27.349 --> 02:18:27.359 align:start position:0%
that they the police department has
 
02:18:29.910 --> 02:18:29.920 align:start position:0%
already um made sure that whoever's
 
02:18:33.070 --> 02:18:33.080 align:start position:0%
coming to pick them up a isn't
 
02:18:36.309 --> 02:18:36.319 align:start position:0%
intoxicated themselves has a valid
 
02:18:40.230 --> 02:18:40.240 align:start position:0%
license so when I when I set the bail
 
02:18:43.669 --> 02:18:43.679 align:start position:0%
for that person they are given a time
 
02:18:47.110 --> 02:18:47.120 align:start position:0%
under the other section as to when
 
02:18:49.990 --> 02:18:50.000 align:start position:0%
they're a able to drive again and
 
02:18:52.230 --> 02:18:52.240 align:start position:0%
depending on how intoxicated they are
 
02:18:56.509 --> 02:18:56.519 align:start position:0%
and what what I because I always ask the
 
02:18:58.629 --> 02:18:58.639 align:start position:0%
police department because they see these
 
02:19:00.509 --> 02:19:00.519 align:start position:0%
people a lot more than I
 
02:19:04.389 --> 02:19:04.399 align:start position:0%
do um what their recommendation is and
 
02:19:07.870 --> 02:19:07.880 align:start position:0%
it's either 12 hours or 24 hours before
 
02:19:09.950 --> 02:19:09.960 align:start position:0%
they're allowed to drive again now they
 
02:19:12.509 --> 02:19:12.519 align:start position:0%
might get out there they might go home
 
02:19:14.469 --> 02:19:14.479 align:start position:0%
they might take their wife's car and
 
02:19:19.270 --> 02:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
drive again the next two hours later
 
02:19:21.469 --> 02:19:21.479 align:start position:0%
nobody can control that they'll just get
 
02:19:23.830 --> 02:19:23.840 align:start position:0%
picked up again if they're weaving and
 
02:19:25.750 --> 02:19:25.760 align:start position:0%
then if they get arrested the second
 
02:19:27.790 --> 02:19:27.800 align:start position:0%
time it's much more
 
02:19:31.509 --> 02:19:31.519 align:start position:0%
serious but if you if you see the forms
 
02:19:34.190 --> 02:19:34.200 align:start position:0%
that I'm talking about you will see that
 
02:19:37.230 --> 02:19:37.240 align:start position:0%
there's all kinds of conditions and
 
02:19:37.240 --> 02:19:38.469 align:start position:0%
there's all kinds of conditions and
there's

02:19:38.469 --> 02:19:38.479 align:start position:0%
there's
 
02:19:43.150 --> 02:19:43.160 align:start position:0%
always um no excessive use of alcohol no
 
02:19:45.389 --> 02:19:45.399 align:start position:0%
use of narcotic drugs or Controlled
 
02:19:48.750 --> 02:19:48.760 align:start position:0%
Substances I always check those off and
 
02:19:50.790 --> 02:19:50.800 align:start position:0%
I always give them a time limit as to
 
02:19:53.710 --> 02:19:53.720 align:start position:0%
when they can drive again and that's
 
02:19:55.790 --> 02:19:55.800 align:start position:0%
that's what I could do that's what a
 
02:19:57.710 --> 02:19:57.720 align:start position:0%
judge could do there's really nothing
 
02:19:59.030 --> 02:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
more you can
 
02:20:04.110 --> 02:20:04.120 align:start position:0%
do unless you you and I for for an a DWI
 
02:20:08.870 --> 02:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
offense especially if it's like a first
 
02:20:10.910 --> 02:20:10.920 align:start position:0%
offense I'm not going to be sending him
 
02:20:13.870 --> 02:20:13.880 align:start position:0%
to jail for 12 hours that would I think
 
02:20:18.309 --> 02:20:18.319 align:start position:0%
be frowned upon by the court and that no
 
02:20:21.590 --> 02:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
judge would do that is is that what you
 
02:20:23.309 --> 02:20:23.319 align:start position:0%
is that what you are thinking yes that
 
02:20:26.670 --> 02:20:26.680 align:start position:0%
answer my question thank you because our
 
02:20:28.750 --> 02:20:28.760 align:start position:0%
our jails aren't that big we can't hold
 
02:20:30.030 --> 02:20:30.040 align:start position:0%
that many
 
02:20:33.110 --> 02:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
people thank you um representative Stone
 
02:20:36.550 --> 02:20:36.560 align:start position:0%
if you if you could just in um in New
 
02:20:38.910 --> 02:20:38.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we have a a protective custody
 
02:20:40.870 --> 02:20:40.880 align:start position:0%
statute that allows the police to hold
 
02:20:42.910 --> 02:20:42.920 align:start position:0%
them until they're sober and safe is
 
02:20:45.230 --> 02:20:45.240 align:start position:0%
that not the case I was just curious to
 
02:20:47.830 --> 02:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
see if we have a policy or directive
 
02:20:49.950 --> 02:20:49.960 align:start position:0%
that if someone's intoxicated or
 
02:20:52.870 --> 02:20:52.880 align:start position:0%
incapacitated by drugs are they actually
 
02:20:53.750 --> 02:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
understanding what they're doing at the
 
02:20:54.910 --> 02:20:54.920 align:start position:0%
time they're bailed and if they take
 
02:20:56.270 --> 02:20:56.280 align:start position:0%
their conditions and throw them in the
 
02:20:58.550 --> 02:20:58.560 align:start position:0%
circular file and later on are they
 
02:20:59.990 --> 02:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
going to claim that they didn't know
 
02:21:01.270 --> 02:21:01.280 align:start position:0%
what they were doing and had no
 
02:21:02.910 --> 02:21:02.920 align:start position:0%
knowledge of it I guess that's an issue
 
02:21:05.150 --> 02:21:05.160 align:start position:0%
some other states have faced and uh
 
02:21:06.630 --> 02:21:06.640 align:start position:0%
sometimes I know at least in the state
 
02:21:08.910 --> 02:21:08.920 align:start position:0%
of Vermont they end up not setting bail
 
02:21:12.110 --> 02:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
until the individual is coherent unable
 
02:21:14.510 --> 02:21:14.520 align:start position:0%
to understand their conditions represent
 
02:21:16.670 --> 02:21:16.680 align:start position:0%
Muse one of one of the things that we've
 
02:21:18.349 --> 02:21:18.359 align:start position:0%
heard uh several times from Bill
 
02:21:22.630 --> 02:21:22.640 align:start position:0%
Commissioners is the the uh the claim
 
02:21:25.070 --> 02:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
that the current statute ties their
 
02:21:28.349 --> 02:21:28.359 align:start position:0%
hands so i' I've heard a number of of
 
02:21:31.429 --> 02:21:31.439 align:start position:0%
folks who testified say that you know I
 
02:21:34.870 --> 02:21:34.880 align:start position:0%
must do a PR bail in in this
 
02:21:38.429 --> 02:21:38.439 align:start position:0%
situation as as I read uh as I read the
 
02:21:41.469 --> 02:21:41.479 align:start position:0%
statute though uh it seems like a person
 
02:21:45.630 --> 02:21:45.640 align:start position:0%
can be held if uh it's felt that the
 
02:21:50.190 --> 02:21:50.200 align:start position:0%
court um uh feels that there's a danger
 
02:21:51.950 --> 02:21:51.960 align:start position:0%
uh to the safety of the public if this
 
02:21:53.349 --> 02:21:53.359 align:start position:0%
person is
 
02:21:56.150 --> 02:21:56.160 align:start position:0%
released so you know I've I've got kind
 
02:21:58.110 --> 02:21:58.120 align:start position:0%
of a conflict I keep hearing on the one
 
02:22:00.309 --> 02:22:00.319 align:start position:0%
hand that folks don't have discretion to
 
02:22:02.309 --> 02:22:02.319 align:start position:0%
hold people on the other hand I see in
 
02:22:06.830 --> 02:22:06.840 align:start position:0%
the statute um that they do and what I'm
 
02:22:09.590 --> 02:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
what I'm curious about
 
02:22:12.990 --> 02:22:13.000 align:start position:0%
is what's what's the filter that causes
 
02:22:16.910 --> 02:22:16.920 align:start position:0%
you to exercise that level of discretion
 
02:22:19.469 --> 02:22:19.479 align:start position:0%
in some cases but not in others and I'm
 
02:22:22.309 --> 02:22:22.319 align:start position:0%
you know I'm thinking that you know
 
02:22:24.389 --> 02:22:24.399 align:start position:0%
nailing the door shut with a woman in
 
02:22:26.270 --> 02:22:26.280 align:start position:0%
the bathroom and shoving her in there
 
02:22:28.990 --> 02:22:29.000 align:start position:0%
that that seems to be a case where you
 
02:22:31.429 --> 02:22:31.439 align:start position:0%
might want to exercise the discretion to
 
02:22:34.030 --> 02:22:34.040 align:start position:0%
hold a person over to see a judge rather
 
02:22:36.630 --> 02:22:36.640 align:start position:0%
than just PR bailing them and it looks
 
02:22:39.030 --> 02:22:39.040 align:start position:0%
like the statute gives you the ability
 
02:22:43.990 --> 02:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
to do that and so why
 
02:22:46.469 --> 02:22:46.479 align:start position:0%
not yes and especially if you have
 
02:22:48.590 --> 02:22:48.600 align:start position:0%
directions from the court not to because
 
02:22:50.590 --> 02:22:50.600 align:start position:0%
that's who you answer to so let if we
 
02:22:53.150 --> 02:22:53.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:57.030 --> 02:22:57.040 align:start position:0%
that that would not happen now
 
02:23:01.510 --> 02:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
because they have added a
 
02:23:03.910 --> 02:23:03.920 align:start position:0%
section the that's why I want you to
 
02:23:05.830 --> 02:23:05.840 align:start position:0%
look at the forms because there's now a
 
02:23:08.670 --> 02:23:08.680 align:start position:0%
section where if you
 
02:23:13.590 --> 02:23:13.600 align:start position:0%
are if you want to hold someone in jail
 
02:23:16.630 --> 02:23:16.640 align:start position:0%
I can now do that but I have to kind of
 
02:23:20.349 --> 02:23:20.359 align:start position:0%
hold a hearing with myself and then
 
02:23:24.790 --> 02:23:24.800 align:start position:0%
write in my reasons for holding them
 
02:23:28.910 --> 02:23:28.920 align:start position:0%
because everything kind of defaults to
 
02:23:35.950 --> 02:23:35.960 align:start position:0%
release and if you want to hold or
 
02:23:38.830 --> 02:23:38.840 align:start position:0%
um do something other than do a PR
 
02:23:41.790 --> 02:23:41.800 align:start position:0%
release you you kind of have to do an
 
02:23:45.750 --> 02:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
exp a wordy explanation of
 
02:23:48.870 --> 02:23:48.880 align:start position:0%
why and I I do hold
 
02:23:52.030 --> 02:23:52.040 align:start position:0%
people you
 
02:23:54.750 --> 02:23:54.760 align:start position:0%
know but there was a period of time when
 
02:23:56.590 --> 02:23:56.600 align:start position:0%
bail reform came in that we were
 
02:23:59.389 --> 02:23:59.399 align:start position:0%
specifically told that ba PR bail was
 
02:24:03.389 --> 02:24:03.399 align:start position:0%
zero dollar and there would be no cash
 
02:24:06.510 --> 02:24:06.520 align:start position:0%
bail and that unless something were
 
02:24:06.520 --> 02:24:07.750 align:start position:0%
bail and that unless something were
really

02:24:07.750 --> 02:24:07.760 align:start position:0%
really
 
02:24:10.469 --> 02:24:10.479 align:start position:0%
drastic they weren't to be sent up to
 
02:24:12.750 --> 02:24:12.760 align:start position:0%
Valley Street or wherever the county
 
02:24:15.710 --> 02:24:15.720 align:start position:0%
court is but that changed again it's
 
02:24:19.230 --> 02:24:19.240 align:start position:0%
it's fluid things have been you know I
 
02:24:22.150 --> 02:24:22.160 align:start position:0%
think Co had a big big effect on that
 
02:24:24.349 --> 02:24:24.359 align:start position:0%
because we couldn't go into police
 
02:24:26.269 --> 02:24:26.279 align:start position:0%
stations for a while and the court was
 
02:24:29.790 --> 02:24:29.800 align:start position:0%
closed for months you know it was it was
 
02:24:31.590 --> 02:24:31.600 align:start position:0%
like a scramble and now we're kind of
 
02:24:34.510 --> 02:24:34.520 align:start position:0%
coming out of that and the rules change
 
02:24:36.950 --> 02:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
every every year when I go to a bail
 
02:24:39.389 --> 02:24:39.399 align:start position:0%
Commissioners meeting which there's one
 
02:24:40.790 --> 02:24:40.800 align:start position:0%
coming up in
 
02:24:43.910 --> 02:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
October um we hear
 
02:24:47.429 --> 02:24:47.439 align:start position:0%
about something new you you know I
 
02:24:49.750 --> 02:24:49.760 align:start position:0%
remember judge Derby saying to us at one
 
02:24:53.590 --> 02:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
of the meetings if somebody has
 
02:24:57.269 --> 02:24:57.279 align:start position:0%
transgressed the same thing like if
 
02:24:59.910 --> 02:24:59.920 align:start position:0%
they've if they've been arrested for
 
02:25:01.870 --> 02:25:01.880 align:start position:0%
whatever it is three times in a row
 
02:25:04.389 --> 02:25:04.399 align:start position:0%
within five
 
02:25:08.110 --> 02:25:08.120 align:start position:0%
years go directly to jail and wait wait
 
02:25:11.550 --> 02:25:11.560 align:start position:0%
to be bailed by the judge actually I
 
02:25:13.070 --> 02:25:13.080 align:start position:0%
think what you're referring to is if
 
02:25:16.710 --> 02:25:16.720 align:start position:0%
someone has failed to appear no it's he
 
02:25:20.870 --> 02:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
was was beyond that it was
 
02:25:23.750 --> 02:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
if well it was he had
 
02:25:23.760 --> 02:25:25.550 align:start position:0%
if well it was he had
said

02:25:25.550 --> 02:25:25.560 align:start position:0%
said
 
02:25:29.670 --> 02:25:29.680 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah or assaults I mean you know
 
02:25:32.150 --> 02:25:32.160 align:start position:0%
like domestic violence assaults what's
 
02:25:33.830 --> 02:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
interesting is I don't believe the
 
02:25:37.469 --> 02:25:37.479 align:start position:0%
statute has changed um since 2018 but
 
02:25:39.269 --> 02:25:39.279 align:start position:0%
your instructions in the court seem to
 
02:25:41.349 --> 02:25:41.359 align:start position:0%
be what is fluid and and that seems to
 
02:25:45.349 --> 02:25:45.359 align:start position:0%
change um the other thing is two years
 
02:25:47.429 --> 02:25:47.439 align:start position:0%
ago when I started started doing
 
02:25:50.830 --> 02:25:50.840 align:start position:0%
telephonic baales for do and
 
02:25:54.830 --> 02:25:54.840 align:start position:0%
Rochester I had already gone to my once
 
02:25:57.950 --> 02:25:57.960 align:start position:0%
a year October bail Commissioners
 
02:26:02.910 --> 02:26:02.920 align:start position:0%
meeting in miramac because that's in our
 
02:26:05.590 --> 02:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
circuit and then I got an invitation to
 
02:26:09.510 --> 02:26:09.520 align:start position:0%
go to the one in over so I responded and
 
02:26:14.230 --> 02:26:14.240 align:start position:0%
said that yes I will go so I went
 
02:26:17.429 --> 02:26:17.439 align:start position:0%
and it was just
 
02:26:20.510 --> 02:26:20.520 align:start position:0%
very enlightening to me the different
 
02:26:23.590 --> 02:26:23.600 align:start position:0%
ways that the different courts actually
 
02:26:26.269 --> 02:26:26.279 align:start position:0%
perceive what we are supposed to be
 
02:26:26.279 --> 02:26:28.150 align:start position:0%
perceive what we are supposed to be
doing

02:26:28.150 --> 02:26:28.160 align:start position:0%
doing
 
02:26:30.910 --> 02:26:30.920 align:start position:0%
and for instance one thing that stuck
 
02:26:34.870 --> 02:26:34.880 align:start position:0%
out in my head is there's a line and
 
02:26:37.269 --> 02:26:37.279 align:start position:0%
this goes back to bail commissioner fees
 
02:26:41.230 --> 02:26:41.240 align:start position:0%
but it says bail commissioner fee $40
 
02:26:44.030 --> 02:26:44.040 align:start position:0%
and then it has a box to check off paid
 
02:26:48.070 --> 02:26:48.080 align:start position:0%
unpaid and then there's a couple other
 
02:26:51.630 --> 02:26:51.640 align:start position:0%
things so I brought this up to the judge
 
02:26:53.950 --> 02:26:53.960 align:start position:0%
in do because I hadn't ever been paid
 
02:26:56.190 --> 02:26:56.200 align:start position:0%
for any of my telephonic ones out of DOA
 
02:27:00.990 --> 02:27:01.000 align:start position:0%
or or Rochester which is her kind of
 
02:27:04.269 --> 02:27:04.279 align:start position:0%
circuit and she said oh I never noticed
 
02:27:08.190 --> 02:27:08.200 align:start position:0%
that and I said oh that's surprising
 
02:27:09.550 --> 02:27:09.560 align:start position:0%
because it's right next to where you
 
02:27:11.389 --> 02:27:11.399 align:start position:0%
have to sign off on the
 
02:27:15.550 --> 02:27:15.560 align:start position:0%
paperwork you know it's it's like so now
 
02:27:17.870 --> 02:27:17.880 align:start position:0%
I make a great big ass is the size of a
 
02:27:22.590 --> 02:27:22.600 align:start position:0%
quarter and I write pay fee at court in
 
02:27:26.230 --> 02:27:26.240 align:start position:0%
handwriting and now I start to get
 
02:27:28.950 --> 02:27:28.960 align:start position:0%
paid you know but it's
 
02:27:32.389 --> 02:27:32.399 align:start position:0%
like aren't they supposed to read these
 
02:27:35.830 --> 02:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
this paperwork you know if I may ask how
 
02:27:37.590 --> 02:27:37.600 align:start position:0%
do you get paid from the court do they
 
02:27:39.429 --> 02:27:39.439 align:start position:0%
they send you a check from the the state
 
02:27:40.710 --> 02:27:40.720 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire how does that work if
 
02:27:42.870 --> 02:27:42.880 align:start position:0%
if the court collects the
 
02:27:46.710 --> 02:27:46.720 align:start position:0%
fee then they remit it to New hampsh
 
02:27:49.750 --> 02:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
ampire judicial branch administrative
 
02:27:53.510 --> 02:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
whatever and that all gets
 
02:27:57.389 --> 02:27:57.399 align:start position:0%
aggregated and I get a check and
 
02:27:58.990 --> 02:27:59.000 align:start position:0%
sometimes I'll get it's interesting
 
02:28:01.150 --> 02:28:01.160 align:start position:0%
because sometimes I'll get a check for
 
02:28:03.830 --> 02:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
$40 or sometimes I'll get two of them on
 
02:28:06.150 --> 02:28:06.160 align:start position:0%
the same check sometimes I'll get two
 
02:28:08.309 --> 02:28:08.319 align:start position:0%
checks in the same
 
02:28:12.269 --> 02:28:12.279 align:start position:0%
envelope I mean and and the other thing
 
02:28:14.950 --> 02:28:14.960 align:start position:0%
you talk about communication all
 
02:28:17.910 --> 02:28:17.920 align:start position:0%
right I recently L changed my post
 
02:28:17.920 --> 02:28:20.269 align:start position:0%
right I recently L changed my post
office

02:28:20.269 --> 02:28:20.279 align:start position:0%
office
 
02:28:24.349 --> 02:28:24.359 align:start position:0%
box and I advised the administrative
 
02:28:28.030 --> 02:28:28.040 align:start position:0%
court and I asked Vicki day I said who
 
02:28:30.750 --> 02:28:30.760 align:start position:0%
should I tell its Superior Court and she
 
02:28:33.269 --> 02:28:33.279 align:start position:0%
said well she said you're going to have
 
02:28:36.790 --> 02:28:36.800 align:start position:0%
to tell every Court you do business
 
02:28:39.429 --> 02:28:39.439 align:start position:0%
with what your change of address is and
 
02:28:41.990 --> 02:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
I said well why I said the checks all
 
02:28:43.830 --> 02:28:43.840 align:start position:0%
come out of one
 
02:28:46.950 --> 02:28:46.960 align:start position:0%
place she said because when they do the
 
02:28:50.150 --> 02:28:50.160 align:start position:0%
paperwork and they send the money
 
02:28:52.790 --> 02:28:52.800 align:start position:0%
in your
 
02:28:57.389 --> 02:28:57.399 align:start position:0%
$40 has to be directed by them to go to
 
02:28:59.550 --> 02:28:59.560 align:start position:0%
a specific
 
02:29:02.030 --> 02:29:02.040 align:start position:0%
address so the and they never get rid of
 
02:29:04.349 --> 02:29:04.359 align:start position:0%
the old address so so the finance people
 
02:29:06.389 --> 02:29:06.399 align:start position:0%
who cut the check don't maintain your
 
02:29:08.309 --> 02:29:08.319 align:start position:0%
information they just each individual
 
02:29:09.830 --> 02:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
it's crazy
 
02:29:12.590 --> 02:29:12.600 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean this whole system needs an
 
02:29:15.790 --> 02:29:15.800 align:start position:0%
organizational person more than a rules
 
02:29:18.670 --> 02:29:18.680 align:start position:0%
person yeah yeah well sometimes the rule
 
02:29:20.269 --> 02:29:20.279 align:start position:0%
will make an organizational person
 
02:29:23.389 --> 02:29:23.399 align:start position:0%
appear thank you um any further
 
02:29:24.630 --> 02:29:24.640 align:start position:0%
questions this witness has got up
 
02:29:27.630 --> 02:29:27.640 align:start position:0%
several times right thank you uh and
 
02:29:29.910 --> 02:29:29.920 align:start position:0%
next thank you very much now I'm going
 
02:29:32.309 --> 02:29:32.319 align:start position:0%
to ask you to start because I believe
 
02:29:33.870 --> 02:29:33.880 align:start position:0%
you and I had a discussion is where I
 
02:29:35.550 --> 02:29:35.560 align:start position:0%
got this concept of having to mail some
 
02:29:37.630 --> 02:29:37.640 align:start position:0%
paperwork in so if you could begin with
 
02:29:40.030 --> 02:29:40.040 align:start position:0%
that I'd appreciate it it might help my
 
02:29:40.040 --> 02:29:43.150 align:start position:0%
that I'd appreciate it it might help my
my

02:29:43.150 --> 02:29:43.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:45.550 --> 02:29:45.560 align:start position:0%
reputation good afternoon Mr chairman
 
02:29:46.990 --> 02:29:47.000 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee thank you
 
02:29:48.910 --> 02:29:48.920 align:start position:0%
for allowing me the opportunity my name
 
02:29:51.349 --> 02:29:51.359 align:start position:0%
is Paul liry I live in Franklin New
 
02:29:53.389 --> 02:29:53.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'm appointed as a bail
 
02:29:55.030 --> 02:29:55.040 align:start position:0%
commissioner out of the Franklin Circuit
 
02:29:57.230 --> 02:29:57.240 align:start position:0%
Court which at the time was a Franklin
 
02:29:58.950 --> 02:29:58.960 align:start position:0%
District Court which was only this much
 
02:30:00.870 --> 02:30:00.880 align:start position:0%
room rather than this much room
 
02:30:02.349 --> 02:30:02.359 align:start position:0%
currently when we have to write the
 
02:30:05.469 --> 02:30:05.479 align:start position:0%
checks that's a story for another
 
02:30:08.269 --> 02:30:08.279 align:start position:0%
day one of the things that I keep
 
02:30:11.469 --> 02:30:11.479 align:start position:0%
hearing is people forget bail
 
02:30:13.990 --> 02:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
Commissioners are directed to do two
 
02:30:16.630 --> 02:30:16.640 align:start position:0%
things in the paperwork that we hand out
 
02:30:19.990 --> 02:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
I'm supposed to reasonably assure that
 
02:30:22.990 --> 02:30:23.000 align:start position:0%
the defendant will appear in court and
 
02:30:25.429 --> 02:30:25.439 align:start position:0%
then by clear and convincing evidence
 
02:30:28.070 --> 02:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
that he won't
 
02:30:30.550 --> 02:30:30.560 align:start position:0%
reoffend if he's going to be in that
 
02:30:32.750 --> 02:30:32.760 align:start position:0%
reoffending mode that's when we check
 
02:30:35.269 --> 02:30:35.279 align:start position:0%
off preventative detention and they go
 
02:30:38.630 --> 02:30:38.640 align:start position:0%
down to the jail and they see the judge
 
02:30:41.389 --> 02:30:41.399 align:start position:0%
within 24 to 48 hours depending if it's
 
02:30:43.429 --> 02:30:43.439 align:start position:0%
District of superior
 
02:30:45.990 --> 02:30:46.000 align:start position:0%
court at least in the Circuit Court bail
 
02:30:48.070 --> 02:30:48.080 align:start position:0%
La of form forms we have room to write
 
02:30:50.349 --> 02:30:50.359 align:start position:0%
My reasonings down so the judge would
 
02:30:52.830 --> 02:30:52.840 align:start position:0%
see why I did what I did and the
 
02:30:55.030 --> 02:30:55.040 align:start position:0%
superior court it's just a checkbox and
 
02:30:57.550 --> 02:30:57.560 align:start position:0%
the county attorney's office takes that
 
02:31:01.510 --> 02:31:01.520 align:start position:0%
over so the thing is I've been almost 35
 
02:31:03.190 --> 02:31:03.200 align:start position:0%
years in law enforcement and Public
 
02:31:05.710 --> 02:31:05.720 align:start position:0%
Safety and I'm 7 and a half years as a
 
02:31:08.110 --> 02:31:08.120 align:start position:0%
bail commissioner so about 43 and a half
 
02:31:09.590 --> 02:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
years of playing the
 
02:31:12.269 --> 02:31:12.279 align:start position:0%
game and I have a lot of repeat
 
02:31:14.389 --> 02:31:14.399 align:start position:0%
customers I am seeing children
 
02:31:16.070 --> 02:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
grandchildren and great grandchildren of
 
02:31:17.710 --> 02:31:17.720 align:start position:0%
people that I dealt with out on the
 
02:31:20.590 --> 02:31:20.600 align:start position:0%
street and I'm now working with children
 
02:31:22.710 --> 02:31:22.720 align:start position:0%
and grandchildren of police officers
 
02:31:25.349 --> 02:31:25.359 align:start position:0%
that I worked for when I was out there
 
02:31:28.630 --> 02:31:28.640 align:start position:0%
so I've been around I've seen a lot and
 
02:31:31.150 --> 02:31:31.160 align:start position:0%
the biggest thing that happened and uh
 
02:31:34.429 --> 02:31:34.439 align:start position:0%
Judy kind of alluded to it was in 2018
 
02:31:36.070 --> 02:31:36.080 align:start position:0%
when we had the big bail
 
02:31:38.469 --> 02:31:38.479 align:start position:0%
reform everyone slammed the brakes on
 
02:31:41.070 --> 02:31:41.080 align:start position:0%
and everyone was afraid to do something
 
02:31:42.870 --> 02:31:42.880 align:start position:0%
well I'm old school because I spent the
 
02:31:44.710 --> 02:31:44.720 align:start position:0%
time in law enforcement when you got a
 
02:31:46.630 --> 02:31:46.640 align:start position:0%
question where do you go back to the
 
02:31:49.870 --> 02:31:49.880 align:start position:0%
rules you know go look at the reason why
 
02:31:51.670 --> 02:31:51.680 align:start position:0%
the legislature did what they did what
 
02:31:54.630 --> 02:31:54.640 align:start position:0%
does the RSA say how did it
 
02:31:57.349 --> 02:31:57.359 align:start position:0%
affect and then we also had to follow
 
02:32:00.190 --> 02:32:00.200 align:start position:0%
what the court was giving us for
 
02:32:03.190 --> 02:32:03.200 align:start position:0%
direction and was correct all we had was
 
02:32:05.830 --> 02:32:05.840 align:start position:0%
PR bail before it used to be PR bail and
 
02:32:07.550 --> 02:32:07.560 align:start position:0%
there was room for an amount there was a
 
02:32:10.309 --> 02:32:10.319 align:start position:0%
period at the end of PR bail they didn't
 
02:32:12.030 --> 02:32:12.040 align:start position:0%
want a number amount on it because
 
02:32:14.230 --> 02:32:14.240 align:start position:0%
before we do PR bailing we'd set an
 
02:32:16.590 --> 02:32:16.600 align:start position:0%
amount just to let them know that if it
 
02:32:18.710 --> 02:32:18.720 align:start position:0%
ever ended up as a cash situation that's
 
02:32:19.750 --> 02:32:19.760 align:start position:0%
what it could
 
02:32:23.110 --> 02:32:23.120 align:start position:0%
be and the days that the $25,000 and
 
02:32:25.349 --> 02:32:25.359 align:start position:0%
$50,000 cash bails
 
02:32:28.070 --> 02:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
disappeared and we started seeing people
 
02:32:31.790 --> 02:32:31.800 align:start position:0%
that I was bailing out for $25 $50
 
02:32:35.950 --> 02:32:35.960 align:start position:0%
$100 and if it was civil $121
 
02:32:39.510 --> 02:32:39.520 align:start position:0%
123 and you try to find pennies nickels
 
02:32:42.190 --> 02:32:42.200 align:start position:0%
and dimes since I was a paper boy back
 
02:32:44.790 --> 02:32:44.800 align:start position:0%
about 60 years ago I haven't carried
 
02:32:47.030 --> 02:32:47.040 align:start position:0%
that little change thing on my my my
 
02:32:49.309 --> 02:32:49.319 align:start position:0%
belt so I mean there's a lot of things
 
02:32:52.790 --> 02:32:52.800 align:start position:0%
that are out there that go into it but I
 
02:32:54.750 --> 02:32:54.760 align:start position:0%
think some of the things that I've heard
 
02:32:56.590 --> 02:32:56.600 align:start position:0%
a lot of them are
 
02:32:58.870 --> 02:32:58.880 align:start position:0%
communication it's like I heard talk
 
02:33:01.710 --> 02:33:01.720 align:start position:0%
about probation and parole well because
 
02:33:03.750 --> 02:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
I was police officer I understand if I
 
02:33:05.309 --> 02:33:05.319 align:start position:0%
couldn't get a hold of the probation and
 
02:33:07.469 --> 02:33:07.479 align:start position:0%
parole officer I would call prison
 
02:33:09.830 --> 02:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
control and I would leave a message with
 
02:33:13.990 --> 02:33:14.000 align:start position:0%
prison control to let the uh po or the
 
02:33:17.309 --> 02:33:17.319 align:start position:0%
probate the parole officer know that
 
02:33:19.630 --> 02:33:19.640 align:start position:0%
there was requesting a 72-hour hold from
 
02:33:22.230 --> 02:33:22.240 align:start position:0%
the bail commissioner and it would be
 
02:33:25.230 --> 02:33:25.240 align:start position:0%
done and I have usually we'll tell the
 
02:33:26.910 --> 02:33:26.920 align:start position:0%
police departments if we want to hold
 
02:33:29.750 --> 02:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
them on a 72-hour hold to reach out to
 
02:33:31.469 --> 02:33:31.479 align:start position:0%
prison control and make that phone call
 
02:33:33.830 --> 02:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
and leave the message once it's done we
 
02:33:38.309 --> 02:33:38.319 align:start position:0%
can check the box off so we've had some
 
02:33:41.230 --> 02:33:41.240 align:start position:0%
you know luck with doing things like
 
02:33:43.710 --> 02:33:43.720 align:start position:0%
that uh a few things that I've heard
 
02:33:47.469 --> 02:33:47.479 align:start position:0%
here about mailing stuff uh faxing stuff
 
02:33:49.790 --> 02:33:49.800 align:start position:0%
and uh snail
 
02:33:52.429 --> 02:33:52.439 align:start position:0%
mail snail mail when I used to be able
 
02:33:54.349 --> 02:33:54.359 align:start position:0%
to send a letter out of Franklin in of
 
02:33:56.070 --> 02:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
the day I could get it into lonia
 
02:33:58.550 --> 02:33:58.560 align:start position:0%
conquer or Manchester without a problem
 
02:34:00.910 --> 02:34:00.920 align:start position:0%
it's now four to six days to get it to
 
02:34:05.910 --> 02:34:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:08.830 --> 02:34:08.840 align:start position:0%
mind in other words when I do the bail
 
02:34:11.389 --> 02:34:11.399 align:start position:0%
paperwork I take the bail paperwork Fold
 
02:34:13.070 --> 02:34:13.080 align:start position:0%
It Up put it in an envelope that I have
 
02:34:16.710 --> 02:34:16.720 align:start position:0%
to buy on paper that I had to buy with
 
02:34:18.870 --> 02:34:18.880 align:start position:0%
ink that I had to pay for to make the
 
02:34:21.389 --> 02:34:21.399 align:start position:0%
form to send it out and then put the
 
02:34:22.990 --> 02:34:23.000 align:start position:0%
stamp on it and the stamp keeps getting
 
02:34:25.110 --> 02:34:25.120 align:start position:0%
more and more expensive and then that
 
02:34:27.910 --> 02:34:27.920 align:start position:0%
goes to the court now that's for almost
 
02:34:30.750 --> 02:34:30.760 align:start position:0%
everything however if I have someone
 
02:34:32.230 --> 02:34:32.240 align:start position:0%
that I'm holding
 
02:34:34.670 --> 02:34:34.680 align:start position:0%
overnight I
 
02:34:38.469 --> 02:34:38.479 align:start position:0%
email to the courts now the problem is
 
02:34:41.750 --> 02:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
for all the Superior Courts we have a
 
02:34:45.550 --> 02:34:45.560 align:start position:0%
direct one from Bales at in the name of
 
02:34:47.870 --> 02:34:47.880 align:start position:0%
the Court and we send it to them so they
 
02:34:49.110 --> 02:34:49.120 align:start position:0%
have it so first thing in the morning
 
02:34:51.550 --> 02:34:51.560 align:start position:0%
when they get in there it's there with
 
02:34:53.710 --> 02:34:53.720 align:start position:0%
the circuit CAU they do everything by
 
02:34:56.630 --> 02:34:56.640 align:start position:0%
facts well I haven't had an analog phone
 
02:34:59.550 --> 02:34:59.560 align:start position:0%
line in my house in over 10 years so I'm
 
02:35:02.389 --> 02:35:02.399 align:start position:0%
not paying $40 to $80 a month to have a
 
02:35:05.630 --> 02:35:05.640 align:start position:0%
service so I can send a fax to the court
 
02:35:08.870 --> 02:35:08.880 align:start position:0%
because again I only get paid 62 to 68%
 
02:35:10.950 --> 02:35:10.960 align:start position:0%
of the time but I do take credit card
 
02:35:12.910 --> 02:35:12.920 align:start position:0%
for bail and pay the
 
02:35:16.710 --> 02:35:16.720 align:start position:0%
$149 I looked at it this way $38 51
 
02:35:19.630 --> 02:35:19.640 align:start position:0%
cents was better than no cense at all so
 
02:35:21.269 --> 02:35:21.279 align:start position:0%
you know it's one of those things that
 
02:35:24.269 --> 02:35:24.279 align:start position:0%
you just start balancing if I may just
 
02:35:27.870 --> 02:35:27.880 align:start position:0%
pause for a sec so we heard some people
 
02:35:29.990 --> 02:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
um say that well no no no you it's not
 
02:35:32.750 --> 02:35:32.760 align:start position:0%
mailed it's fax that's not mandatory so
 
02:35:35.590 --> 02:35:35.600 align:start position:0%
if you don't have a fact uh no I that's
 
02:35:38.190 --> 02:35:38.200 align:start position:0%
why I email in other words you learn how
 
02:35:40.070 --> 02:35:40.080 align:start position:0%
to get around what has to be done to
 
02:35:42.870 --> 02:35:42.880 align:start position:0%
make it happen and if not sometimes what
 
02:35:44.269 --> 02:35:44.279 align:start position:0%
I'll do is I'll have the police
 
02:35:47.349 --> 02:35:47.359 align:start position:0%
department fax the form for me to the
 
02:35:49.990 --> 02:35:50.000 align:start position:0%
court to make sure that it's there when
 
02:35:52.070 --> 02:35:52.080 align:start position:0%
it's domestic violence it's pretty much
 
02:35:56.190 --> 02:35:56.200 align:start position:0%
spelled out I'm required to send to the
 
02:35:58.870 --> 02:35:58.880 align:start position:0%
court that and I send the ones that I
 
02:36:00.750 --> 02:36:00.760 align:start position:0%
know by email the others I have the
 
02:36:03.790 --> 02:36:03.800 align:start position:0%
police department if it's on Friday
 
02:36:07.510 --> 02:36:07.520 align:start position:0%
night until Monday morning or Tuesday
 
02:36:10.389 --> 02:36:10.399 align:start position:0%
morning if it's a holiday at 8: a.m. the
 
02:36:12.389 --> 02:36:12.399 align:start position:0%
police departments are supposed to fax
 
02:36:14.950 --> 02:36:14.960 align:start position:0%
that information to State Police and
 
02:36:17.030 --> 02:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
state police will atically put it into
 
02:36:19.190 --> 02:36:19.200 align:start position:0%
the National Registry on domestic
 
02:36:20.750 --> 02:36:20.760 align:start position:0%
violence and that's one of the first
 
02:36:22.750 --> 02:36:22.760 align:start position:0%
things that shows up on the criminal
 
02:36:25.349 --> 02:36:25.359 align:start position:0%
records that we have an opportunity to
 
02:36:27.670 --> 02:36:27.680 align:start position:0%
see part of the things that you're
 
02:36:29.550 --> 02:36:29.560 align:start position:0%
talking about having access there's a
 
02:36:31.710 --> 02:36:31.720 align:start position:0%
thing called sieges it's the federal
 
02:36:35.269 --> 02:36:35.279 align:start position:0%
regulations that say we're not sworn
 
02:36:38.309 --> 02:36:38.319 align:start position:0%
officers of the you know law enforcement
 
02:36:40.469 --> 02:36:40.479 align:start position:0%
so we're not entitled to it however
 
02:36:43.110 --> 02:36:43.120 align:start position:0%
there is an exception in seis as a bail
 
02:36:45.950 --> 02:36:45.960 align:start position:0%
commissioner I can review but I can't
 
02:36:48.389 --> 02:36:48.399 align:start position:0%
keep they give me it I read it take my
 
02:36:50.510 --> 02:36:50.520 align:start position:0%
notes I give it back or they read it to
 
02:36:51.950 --> 02:36:51.960 align:start position:0%
me over the phone so I can have the
 
02:36:54.670 --> 02:36:54.680 align:start position:0%
information I need so the thing is
 
02:36:56.830 --> 02:36:56.840 align:start position:0%
that's happening but where it gets
 
02:36:58.630 --> 02:36:58.640 align:start position:0%
problematic is right now I'm bailing in
 
02:37:02.349 --> 02:37:02.359 align:start position:0%
nine counties because of Co I've done
 
02:37:04.670 --> 02:37:04.680 align:start position:0%
over a thousand of the remote or tele
 
02:37:07.150 --> 02:37:07.160 align:start position:0%
baings and you finally work around them
 
02:37:08.950 --> 02:37:08.960 align:start position:0%
and you make it work some of them we do
 
02:37:11.309 --> 02:37:11.319 align:start position:0%
FaceTime some of them we do Zoom but
 
02:37:13.429 --> 02:37:13.439 align:start position:0%
some of them don't have the connectivity
 
02:37:15.550 --> 02:37:15.560 align:start position:0%
so we do it over the telephone in other
 
02:37:18.510 --> 02:37:18.520 align:start position:0%
words there is a way to make it work but
 
02:37:20.389 --> 02:37:20.399 align:start position:0%
it becomes a challenge the smaller
 
02:37:22.469 --> 02:37:22.479 align:start position:0%
police departments don't have access
 
02:37:24.670 --> 02:37:24.680 align:start position:0%
directly to any of that if they go
 
02:37:26.630 --> 02:37:26.640 align:start position:0%
through a larger Police Department or a
 
02:37:29.309 --> 02:37:29.319 align:start position:0%
county because of sieges requirements
 
02:37:31.230 --> 02:37:31.240 align:start position:0%
they can't fax it to them they can't
 
02:37:34.389 --> 02:37:34.399 align:start position:0%
email it to them they can read it to
 
02:37:36.349 --> 02:37:36.359 align:start position:0%
them but the problem is if there's only
 
02:37:39.550 --> 02:37:39.560 align:start position:0%
one dispatcher on they don't have the
 
02:37:42.269 --> 02:37:42.279 align:start position:0%
time to be able to do that so that
 
02:37:43.630 --> 02:37:43.640 align:start position:0%
becomes a catch
 
02:37:46.830 --> 02:37:46.840 align:start position:0%
22 and so sometimes the quick way to
 
02:37:49.349 --> 02:37:49.359 align:start position:0%
skirt it is because about roughly 95% of
 
02:37:50.750 --> 02:37:50.760 align:start position:0%
the people when you ask them straightly
 
02:37:52.870 --> 02:37:52.880 align:start position:0%
are you a convicted felon yeah you on
 
02:37:55.429 --> 02:37:55.439 align:start position:0%
probation appr Pro yeah and they'll
 
02:37:57.710 --> 02:37:57.720 align:start position:0%
answer and you know when you're going
 
02:37:59.510 --> 02:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
like it that pretty much you got a
 
02:38:01.830 --> 02:38:01.840 align:start position:0%
pretty good idea when you start checking
 
02:38:04.510 --> 02:38:04.520 align:start position:0%
off conditions that you're going to want
 
02:38:06.349 --> 02:38:06.359 align:start position:0%
and the thing is it's nice to have your
 
02:38:07.630 --> 02:38:07.640 align:start position:0%
hand on the
 
02:38:10.190 --> 02:38:10.200 align:start position:0%
criminal record but the thing is
 
02:38:12.590 --> 02:38:12.600 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's just not available so you
 
02:38:14.790 --> 02:38:14.800 align:start position:0%
figure out other ways to do it if the
 
02:38:16.830 --> 02:38:16.840 align:start position:0%
statute changed that you did have to
 
02:38:20.510 --> 02:38:20.520 align:start position:0%
swear not for in whatever capacity you
 
02:38:22.990 --> 02:38:23.000 align:start position:0%
would then be able to your understanding
 
02:38:26.590 --> 02:38:26.600 align:start position:0%
access sieges the sieges has to do with
 
02:38:28.950 --> 02:38:28.960 align:start position:0%
Federal that's that's all the federal
 
02:38:31.870 --> 02:38:31.880 align:start position:0%
agencies that State Police signs off and
 
02:38:33.710 --> 02:38:33.720 align:start position:0%
then the police department sign off to
 
02:38:35.790 --> 02:38:35.800 align:start position:0%
be able to right get that but parole
 
02:38:37.870 --> 02:38:37.880 align:start position:0%
information officers have access to it
 
02:38:39.950 --> 02:38:39.960 align:start position:0%
correct I'm not sure yeah I believe they
 
02:38:42.309 --> 02:38:42.319 align:start position:0%
are so if if we were to make sure that
 
02:38:44.269 --> 02:38:44.279 align:start position:0%
the statute provided you with the
 
02:38:47.190 --> 02:38:47.200 align:start position:0%
necessary um access access or or
 
02:38:48.990 --> 02:38:49.000 align:start position:0%
necessary to fulfill the federal
 
02:38:51.429 --> 02:38:51.439 align:start position:0%
requirement for you to access it I guess
 
02:38:53.030 --> 02:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
I'm getting at is it would it be better
 
02:38:55.030 --> 02:38:55.040 align:start position:0%
if you could just have those see it in
 
02:38:56.910 --> 02:38:56.920 align:start position:0%
real time because I know if you got a an
 
02:38:59.269 --> 02:38:59.279 align:start position:0%
arreste from say MK because that's one
 
02:39:00.670 --> 02:39:00.680 align:start position:0%
of our closest states with the most
 
02:39:02.550 --> 02:39:02.560 align:start position:0%
population you could have someone with a
 
02:39:04.790 --> 02:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
10-page record and no one's reading you
 
02:39:08.150 --> 02:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
that over the phone and and each record
 
02:39:11.190 --> 02:39:11.200 align:start position:0%
each each um line on the record will
 
02:39:13.590 --> 02:39:13.600 align:start position:0%
have information like default default
 
02:39:16.190 --> 02:39:16.200 align:start position:0%
picked up you'll know their history of
 
02:39:18.429 --> 02:39:18.439 align:start position:0%
it does and it doesn't because each one
 
02:39:20.269 --> 02:39:20.279 align:start position:0%
of the states are different and I'm
 
02:39:22.110 --> 02:39:22.120 align:start position:0%
telling you when you read some of those
 
02:39:24.190 --> 02:39:24.200 align:start position:0%
I have no clue when they were arrested
 
02:39:26.030 --> 02:39:26.040 align:start position:0%
if they ever saw a judge what the
 
02:39:28.830 --> 02:39:28.840 align:start position:0%
outcome was or anything because it's not
 
02:39:31.389 --> 02:39:31.399 align:start position:0%
spelled out as neatly as Oz is but it
 
02:39:33.269 --> 02:39:33.279 align:start position:0%
took o a long time to get so when you
 
02:39:34.830 --> 02:39:34.840 align:start position:0%
looked at the criminal record you could
 
02:39:42.230 --> 02:39:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:44.630 --> 02:39:44.640 align:start position:0%
on but
 
02:39:44.640 --> 02:39:47.190 align:start position:0%
on but
uh

02:39:47.190 --> 02:39:47.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:39:49.349 --> 02:39:49.359 align:start position:0%
and the thing is with the uh requirement
 
02:39:52.269 --> 02:39:52.279 align:start position:0%
to 24 to 48 hours holding that's
 
02:39:55.309 --> 02:39:55.319 align:start position:0%
excluding weekends and holidays but yet
 
02:39:57.309 --> 02:39:57.319 align:start position:0%
if like for Thanksgiving where they have
 
02:39:59.389 --> 02:39:59.399 align:start position:0%
Thanksgiving and the Friday off the
 
02:40:01.590 --> 02:40:01.600 align:start position:0%
court is required to hold bail hearings
 
02:40:04.110 --> 02:40:04.120 align:start position:0%
on the Saturday because of the amount of
 
02:40:05.469 --> 02:40:05.479 align:start position:0%
time that they'd be
 
02:40:09.230 --> 02:40:09.240 align:start position:0%
held so and that's at the courthouse is
 
02:40:11.550 --> 02:40:11.560 align:start position:0%
open on Saturday during those occas I
 
02:40:13.429 --> 02:40:13.439 align:start position:0%
don't know what they do I'm having a
 
02:40:15.590 --> 02:40:15.600 align:start position:0%
funny feeling that that's probably all
 
02:40:17.950 --> 02:40:17.960 align:start position:0%
On video okay in other words they have
 
02:40:20.670 --> 02:40:20.680 align:start position:0%
the ability to do it and I think what
 
02:40:21.950 --> 02:40:21.960 align:start position:0%
the committee is picking up is there's a
 
02:40:22.990 --> 02:40:23.000 align:start position:0%
lot of
 
02:40:24.990 --> 02:40:25.000 align:start position:0%
compartmentalization in other words you
 
02:40:28.110 --> 02:40:28.120 align:start position:0%
know what you guys do and but beyond
 
02:40:29.950 --> 02:40:29.960 align:start position:0%
that that's really you know their what
 
02:40:31.790 --> 02:40:31.800 align:start position:0%
they do and then before what happens
 
02:40:34.110 --> 02:40:34.120 align:start position:0%
before they see you is something else
 
02:40:35.910 --> 02:40:35.920 align:start position:0%
and then what you each do is a little
 
02:40:37.630 --> 02:40:37.640 align:start position:0%
bit different absolutely and if you
 
02:40:40.030 --> 02:40:40.040 align:start position:0%
listen to us each one of us came on at a
 
02:40:42.429 --> 02:40:42.439 align:start position:0%
different time frame when I came on my
 
02:40:44.750 --> 02:40:44.760 align:start position:0%
training was I had to follow a bail
 
02:40:47.389 --> 02:40:47.399 align:start position:0%
commissioner to see two baales first one
 
02:40:49.790 --> 02:40:49.800 align:start position:0%
was a be misdemeanor which is a non-
 
02:40:52.070 --> 02:40:52.080 align:start position:0%
jailable offense doesn't need a lawyer
 
02:40:53.550 --> 02:40:53.560 align:start position:0%
so you what you need to know in a
 
02:40:56.349 --> 02:40:56.359 align:start position:0%
circuit court bail order four pages the
 
02:40:59.190 --> 02:40:59.200 align:start position:0%
next one was a civil bond which was a
 
02:41:02.510 --> 02:41:02.520 align:start position:0%
one page at that point I was blessed go
 
02:41:05.590 --> 02:41:05.600 align:start position:0%
forth and have fun and it was a School
 
02:41:06.590 --> 02:41:06.600 align:start position:0%
of Hard
 
02:41:09.309 --> 02:41:09.319 align:start position:0%
Knocks the training was catches catch
 
02:41:11.429 --> 02:41:11.439 align:start position:0%
can some of it was good used to be when
 
02:41:13.150 --> 02:41:13.160 align:start position:0%
they changed the paperwork that's when
 
02:41:14.950 --> 02:41:14.960 align:start position:0%
we'd get training and we'd be trained on
 
02:41:17.349 --> 02:41:17.359 align:start position:0%
how the paperwork what the court was
 
02:41:19.710 --> 02:41:19.720 align:start position:0%
looking for in the paperwork and that
 
02:41:22.190 --> 02:41:22.200 align:start position:0%
was what they were concerned about after
 
02:41:24.349 --> 02:41:24.359 align:start position:0%
the legislature put in that we required
 
02:41:26.630 --> 02:41:26.640 align:start position:0%
training the first training we had
 
02:41:30.269 --> 02:41:30.279 align:start position:0%
lasted 21 minutes it was over a video I
 
02:41:31.750 --> 02:41:31.760 align:start position:0%
sat at the conquered District Court
 
02:41:34.750 --> 02:41:34.760 align:start position:0%
Judge Kelly was presiding and
 
02:41:37.630 --> 02:41:37.640 align:start position:0%
the hookup or link didn't
 
02:41:41.269 --> 02:41:41.279 align:start position:0%
work so needless to say it was a
 
02:41:43.750 --> 02:41:43.760 align:start position:0%
disaster and then we at least had two
 
02:41:45.990 --> 02:41:46.000 align:start position:0%
judges sitting there and says well guys
 
02:41:49.269 --> 02:41:49.279 align:start position:0%
we're here do you have any questions and
 
02:41:53.469 --> 02:41:53.479 align:start position:0%
then some training happened uh and
 
02:41:56.030 --> 02:41:56.040 align:start position:0%
particularly where I'm in Franklin I'm
 
02:41:58.670 --> 02:41:58.680 align:start position:0%
the only bail Commissioner of wrecked
 
02:42:02.150 --> 02:42:02.160 align:start position:0%
that was basically came out of Franklin
 
02:42:03.830 --> 02:42:03.840 align:start position:0%
the others are out of Lone or out of
 
02:42:05.429 --> 02:42:05.439 align:start position:0%
conquer that they're coming up and
 
02:42:08.309 --> 02:42:08.319 align:start position:0%
helping and covering so the thing is I
 
02:42:10.670 --> 02:42:10.680 align:start position:0%
usually end up either in conquer or in
 
02:42:14.230 --> 02:42:14.240 align:start position:0%
Laconia now last year lon's training we
 
02:42:17.030 --> 02:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
had the clerk two Deputy clerks because
 
02:42:19.389 --> 02:42:19.399 align:start position:0%
it was both Franklin and and lonia but
 
02:42:22.030 --> 02:42:22.040 align:start position:0%
they share the same clerk two judges and
 
02:42:23.590 --> 02:42:23.600 align:start position:0%
the bail Commissioners we went for
 
02:42:25.990 --> 02:42:26.000 align:start position:0%
almost two hours and it was the best
 
02:42:27.510 --> 02:42:27.520 align:start position:0%
training that I've had in basically
 
02:42:31.110 --> 02:42:31.120 align:start position:0%
seven years so the thing is it's again
 
02:42:34.269 --> 02:42:34.279 align:start position:0%
catches catch can depends upon the
 
02:42:36.670 --> 02:42:36.680 align:start position:0%
clerks and sometimes we get the
 
02:42:38.469 --> 02:42:38.479 align:start position:0%
administrative office of the Court where
 
02:42:40.110 --> 02:42:40.120 align:start position:0%
either the administrator of the superior
 
02:42:42.309 --> 02:42:42.319 align:start position:0%
court or of the circuit court gets
 
02:42:43.990 --> 02:42:44.000 align:start position:0%
involved in the training and a little
 
02:42:46.030 --> 02:42:46.040 align:start position:0%
bit more actually happens
 
02:42:47.910 --> 02:42:47.920 align:start position:0%
it's like the ID card you said we were
 
02:42:51.070 --> 02:42:51.080 align:start position:0%
supposed to get I got it in an an 8 and
 
02:42:54.230 --> 02:42:54.240 align:start position:0%
a half by 11 page with this little tiny
 
02:42:56.150 --> 02:42:56.160 align:start position:0%
thing up in the corner that looked like
 
02:42:58.190 --> 02:42:58.200 align:start position:0%
someone in the kindergarten had done it
 
02:42:59.910 --> 02:42:59.920 align:start position:0%
and I was told to use that as my
 
02:43:02.389 --> 02:43:02.399 align:start position:0%
identification as a bail commissioner
 
02:43:04.309 --> 02:43:04.319 align:start position:0%
with all due respect my business card
 
02:43:07.030 --> 02:43:07.040 align:start position:0%
looked more professional than that so
 
02:43:09.030 --> 02:43:09.040 align:start position:0%
the thing is just because the law is
 
02:43:11.349 --> 02:43:11.359 align:start position:0%
made doesn't mean when it finally gets
 
02:43:12.670 --> 02:43:12.680 align:start position:0%
down to
 
02:43:14.790 --> 02:43:14.800 align:start position:0%
the people that are doing the work on
 
02:43:15.990 --> 02:43:16.000 align:start position:0%
the ground
 
02:43:17.830 --> 02:43:17.840 align:start position:0%
that it has the effect that you want it
 
02:43:20.349 --> 02:43:20.359 align:start position:0%
to have the things that I think you
 
02:43:23.710 --> 02:43:23.720 align:start position:0%
heard Judy mention and uh others you
 
02:43:25.670 --> 02:43:25.680 align:start position:0%
want to think of the
 
02:43:28.030 --> 02:43:28.040 align:start position:0%
consequences if you take and add
 
02:43:29.710 --> 02:43:29.720 align:start position:0%
domestic violence on there and you're
 
02:43:32.590 --> 02:43:32.600 align:start position:0%
talking about the misdemeanor side of it
 
02:43:34.349 --> 02:43:34.359 align:start position:0%
sometimes that's telling you the nature
 
02:43:37.910 --> 02:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
of the the offense take for instance I'm
 
02:43:40.389 --> 02:43:40.399 align:start position:0%
in Bristol and I'm bailing someone and I
 
02:43:42.910 --> 02:43:42.920 align:start position:0%
decide to hold
 
02:43:47.510 --> 02:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
them or not there's that chance but the
 
02:43:50.429 --> 02:43:50.439 align:start position:0%
way you you excuse
 
02:43:53.790 --> 02:43:53.800 align:start position:0%
me the way you've written the law it
 
02:43:57.429 --> 02:43:57.439 align:start position:0%
says sha so it's a snowy night one
 
02:43:59.590 --> 02:43:59.600 align:start position:0%
officer on and he's got to go all the
 
02:44:02.150 --> 02:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
way up to North haval to where the
 
02:44:05.110 --> 02:44:05.120 align:start position:0%
county jail is or if you get someone in
 
02:44:07.550 --> 02:44:07.560 align:start position:0%
the bottom of Coos County in the middle
 
02:44:09.349 --> 02:44:09.359 align:start position:0%
of a snowstorm they got to go all the
 
02:44:10.830 --> 02:44:10.840 align:start position:0%
way up to the top of Stewart's toown
 
02:44:12.910 --> 02:44:12.920 align:start position:0%
almost up to the Pittsburgh Town Line
 
02:44:15.910 --> 02:44:15.920 align:start position:0%
where the county jail is there is impact
 
02:44:19.269 --> 02:44:19.279 align:start position:0%
on the rural side of this in the small
 
02:44:20.830 --> 02:44:20.840 align:start position:0%
police departments where there's only
 
02:44:24.389 --> 02:44:24.399 align:start position:0%
one officer out if you're lucky and if
 
02:44:26.990 --> 02:44:27.000 align:start position:0%
it's after 11:00 1:00 in the morning
 
02:44:29.349 --> 02:44:29.359 align:start position:0%
they may be on call covered by State
 
02:44:30.910 --> 02:44:30.920 align:start position:0%
Police and we know they're severely
 
02:44:34.389 --> 02:44:34.399 align:start position:0%
under staff as is the county there may
 
02:44:36.389 --> 02:44:36.399 align:start position:0%
not be anything until that officer gets
 
02:44:39.550 --> 02:44:39.560 align:start position:0%
called out and finally gets there so
 
02:44:41.349 --> 02:44:41.359 align:start position:0%
there's there's a lot of things in play
 
02:44:44.510 --> 02:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
that you want to take a look at the list
 
02:44:47.150 --> 02:44:47.160 align:start position:0%
I would have referred you back to the uh
 
02:44:49.150 --> 02:44:49.160 align:start position:0%
the website for bail Commissioners there
 
02:44:51.070 --> 02:44:51.080 align:start position:0%
used to be a bail Commissioners manual
 
02:44:54.510 --> 02:44:54.520 align:start position:0%
out there I still have my 2016 that I
 
02:44:56.590 --> 02:44:56.600 align:start position:0%
printed off but I knew I could get the
 
02:44:59.870 --> 02:44:59.880 align:start position:0%
2020 that was out on the website well
 
02:45:01.389 --> 02:45:01.399 align:start position:0%
probably about four or five months ago
 
02:45:03.469 --> 02:45:03.479 align:start position:0%
they took that down so I'm still using
 
02:45:03.479 --> 02:45:04.349 align:start position:0%
they took that down so I'm still using
my

02:45:04.349 --> 02:45:04.359 align:start position:0%
my
 
02:45:07.429 --> 02:45:07.439 align:start position:0%
2016 but inside that book there are four
 
02:45:08.670 --> 02:45:08.680 align:start position:0%
things that are listed that we can't
 
02:45:11.590 --> 02:45:11.600 align:start position:0%
write bail for and some of it's the
 
02:45:14.030 --> 02:45:14.040 align:start position:0%
homicide and some of those things and AR
 
02:45:16.510 --> 02:45:16.520 align:start position:0%
rest is left to our discretion and I
 
02:45:18.670 --> 02:45:18.680 align:start position:0%
think the key to it and everyone keeps
 
02:45:20.309 --> 02:45:20.319 align:start position:0%
coming back to it it's
 
02:45:22.309 --> 02:45:22.319 align:start position:0%
training and so that there is a
 
02:45:25.110 --> 02:45:25.120 align:start position:0%
consistency throughout the state I'll
 
02:45:26.830 --> 02:45:26.840 align:start position:0%
just throw this in here just to add a
 
02:45:28.150 --> 02:45:28.160 align:start position:0%
monkey wrench in since you're going to
 
02:45:29.590 --> 02:45:29.600 align:start position:0%
talk to
 
02:45:32.510 --> 02:45:32.520 align:start position:0%
finance there was a thing to put on 15
 
02:45:34.670 --> 02:45:34.680 align:start position:0%
magistrates to replace 100 bail
 
02:45:36.830 --> 02:45:36.840 align:start position:0%
Commissioners that do do it basically
 
02:45:39.230 --> 02:45:39.240 align:start position:0%
for nothing and provide all their own
 
02:45:42.750 --> 02:45:42.760 align:start position:0%
equipment uh and there was a caveat that
 
02:45:46.269 --> 02:45:46.279 align:start position:0%
you would hire someone to train the
 
02:45:48.750 --> 02:45:48.760 align:start position:0%
magistrates the money has already been
 
02:45:51.269 --> 02:45:51.279 align:start position:0%
talked about so if you took that
 
02:45:54.590 --> 02:45:54.600 align:start position:0%
money use that person to train the bail
 
02:45:56.550 --> 02:45:56.560 align:start position:0%
Commissioners and then they got I think
 
02:46:00.389 --> 02:46:00.399 align:start position:0%
$1.6 million to pay for the 15
 
02:46:03.910 --> 02:46:03.920 align:start position:0%
magistrates the support staff and their
 
02:46:06.190 --> 02:46:06.200 align:start position:0%
benefits and all of that stuff and gave
 
02:46:09.110 --> 02:46:09.120 align:start position:0%
that a seed money to go into the court
 
02:46:10.950 --> 02:46:10.960 align:start position:0%
system so that they could pay pay the
 
02:46:12.590 --> 02:46:12.600 align:start position:0%
bail commissioner for everything we
 
02:46:15.349 --> 02:46:15.359 align:start position:0%
wrote every two weeks send us a check at
 
02:46:17.429 --> 02:46:17.439 align:start position:0%
the end of the year give us a $199 we're
 
02:46:19.870 --> 02:46:19.880 align:start position:0%
still an agent we're not an employee and
 
02:46:22.429 --> 02:46:22.439 align:start position:0%
everyone's happy and your bail
 
02:46:23.830 --> 02:46:23.840 align:start position:0%
Commissioners are getting paid at
 
02:46:26.510 --> 02:46:26.520 align:start position:0%
whatever the statutory rate is but with
 
02:46:28.429 --> 02:46:28.439 align:start position:0%
the postage keep going up and gas keep
 
02:46:29.510 --> 02:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
going up you're probably going to have
 
02:46:31.830 --> 02:46:31.840 align:start position:0%
to look at that $40 rate because you
 
02:46:33.750 --> 02:46:33.760 align:start position:0%
stop and think we're not getting it 100%
 
02:46:36.710 --> 02:46:36.720 align:start position:0%
of the time at this point and you speak
 
02:46:40.190 --> 02:46:40.200 align:start position:0%
about equipment I'm now on my second
 
02:46:43.429 --> 02:46:43.439 align:start position:0%
iPad 12 you know the iPad Pro that I do
 
02:46:44.990 --> 02:46:45.000 align:start position:0%
my bailing on with the you know the
 
02:46:47.510 --> 02:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
fancy keyboard I've had to buy two I'm
 
02:46:49.230 --> 02:46:49.240 align:start position:0%
on my second portable printer because I
 
02:46:51.790 --> 02:46:51.800 align:start position:0%
burned my first one out so the thing is
 
02:46:55.030 --> 02:46:55.040 align:start position:0%
those go at450 and the iPads are almost
 
02:46:57.269 --> 02:46:57.279 align:start position:0%
$1,000 so the thing is this these are
 
02:46:59.469 --> 02:46:59.479 align:start position:0%
all things that we provide for ourselves
 
02:47:01.110 --> 02:47:01.120 align:start position:0%
I'm always going out and getting a case
 
02:47:03.429 --> 02:47:03.439 align:start position:0%
of you know 10 RS of paper so that I
 
02:47:04.950 --> 02:47:04.960 align:start position:0%
have the paper on hand to print all the
 
02:47:06.750 --> 02:47:06.760 align:start position:0%
forms that I use because I print them as
 
02:47:10.309 --> 02:47:10.319 align:start position:0%
I go so I mean you got a dedicated group
 
02:47:12.750 --> 02:47:12.760 align:start position:0%
out here but all of a sudden we start
 
02:47:14.590 --> 02:47:14.600 align:start position:0%
reading that the legislature wants to do
 
02:47:16.389 --> 02:47:16.399 align:start position:0%
away with with the bail
 
02:47:19.389 --> 02:47:19.399 align:start position:0%
Commissioners uh Judge Lynn who was the
 
02:47:21.349 --> 02:47:21.359 align:start position:0%
Chief Justice of the Supreme Court the
 
02:47:23.950 --> 02:47:23.960 align:start position:0%
superior court now legislature wanted to
 
02:47:26.269 --> 02:47:26.279 align:start position:0%
put on three Circuit
 
02:47:28.830 --> 02:47:28.840 align:start position:0%
Court judges and do away with bail
 
02:47:29.990 --> 02:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
Commissioners because that'd be enough
 
02:47:33.950 --> 02:47:33.960 align:start position:0%
to handle it so and it gets kind of
 
02:47:36.150 --> 02:47:36.160 align:start position:0%
discouraging for those of us that get up
 
02:47:36.160 --> 02:47:37.670 align:start position:0%
discouraging for those of us that get up
247

02:47:37.670 --> 02:47:37.680 align:start position:0%
247
 
02:47:39.950 --> 02:47:39.960 align:start position:0%
365 it's like this morning I got a call
 
02:47:43.030 --> 02:47:43.040 align:start position:0%
at 3:15 in the morning to do a bail and
 
02:47:44.910 --> 02:47:44.920 align:start position:0%
I still had to get up to be here because
 
02:47:46.389 --> 02:47:46.399 align:start position:0%
I thought it was important enough to be
 
02:47:48.750 --> 02:47:48.760 align:start position:0%
here to give you information that I
 
02:47:50.429 --> 02:47:50.439 align:start position:0%
think that you need before you make
 
02:47:52.110 --> 02:47:52.120 align:start position:0%
decisions about what bail Commissioners
 
02:47:54.309 --> 02:47:54.319 align:start position:0%
are and I'm glad to see you haven't
 
02:47:56.870 --> 02:47:56.880 align:start position:0%
called us bail bondsman that's the first
 
02:47:58.990 --> 02:47:59.000 align:start position:0%
time in several years coming down here
 
02:48:01.590 --> 02:48:01.600 align:start position:0%
since 2019 that we haven't been referred
 
02:48:04.030 --> 02:48:04.040 align:start position:0%
to that because it was one put in by a
 
02:48:06.830 --> 02:48:06.840 align:start position:0%
senator of one of the bail Commissioners
 
02:48:08.230 --> 02:48:08.240 align:start position:0%
specifically to help the bail
 
02:48:09.950 --> 02:48:09.960 align:start position:0%
Commissioners and it said an act
 
02:48:11.950 --> 02:48:11.960 align:start position:0%
relative to bail
 
02:48:16.030 --> 02:48:16.040 align:start position:0%
bondsman and then it was amended and
 
02:48:18.590 --> 02:48:18.600 align:start position:0%
Commissioners I um I can't I can't speak
 
02:48:20.389 --> 02:48:20.399 align:start position:0%
to that but I can tell you that we at
 
02:48:22.510 --> 02:48:22.520 align:start position:0%
least uh read the law before we start
 
02:48:24.670 --> 02:48:24.680 align:start position:0%
talking about changing it so he won't be
 
02:48:27.910 --> 02:48:27.920 align:start position:0%
called a bondsman in here um and we
 
02:48:29.429 --> 02:48:29.439 align:start position:0%
appreciate it and I hope that you heard
 
02:48:31.469 --> 02:48:31.479 align:start position:0%
my earlier statement this committee has
 
02:48:32.830 --> 02:48:32.840 align:start position:0%
no interest in attacking the
 
02:48:34.110 --> 02:48:34.120 align:start position:0%
Commissioners we don't blame the
 
02:48:36.830 --> 02:48:36.840 align:start position:0%
Commissioners this is a systemic issue
 
02:48:38.830 --> 02:48:38.840 align:start position:0%
um the Commissioners are a huge part of
 
02:48:41.309 --> 02:48:41.319 align:start position:0%
it but it's not just the Commissioners
 
02:48:43.150 --> 02:48:43.160 align:start position:0%
it's the it's all the other agencies as
 
02:48:44.630 --> 02:48:44.640 align:start position:0%
well and that and that's the PO when you
 
02:48:46.870 --> 02:48:46.880 align:start position:0%
go go into you have to remember as a
 
02:48:48.950 --> 02:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
bail commissioner I'm making a decision
 
02:48:51.830 --> 02:48:51.840 align:start position:0%
at that point in time that's a snapshot
 
02:48:53.550 --> 02:48:53.560 align:start position:0%
of what I'm seeing what I've read what
 
02:48:55.550 --> 02:48:55.560 align:start position:0%
I've heard from the officers and I've
 
02:48:57.510 --> 02:48:57.520 align:start position:0%
gathered sometimes it's like pulling ey
 
02:48:59.990 --> 02:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
teeth out of a saber-tooth tiger to get
 
02:49:02.429 --> 02:49:02.439 align:start position:0%
the information you need to really do a
 
02:49:03.790 --> 02:49:03.800 align:start position:0%
good job with the
 
02:49:06.870 --> 02:49:06.880 align:start position:0%
bail and then it goes to the
 
02:49:10.110 --> 02:49:10.120 align:start position:0%
court the prosecutor the judge the
 
02:49:12.269 --> 02:49:12.279 align:start position:0%
County Attorney they're all involved in
 
02:49:14.429 --> 02:49:14.439 align:start position:0%
that process I hold them in preventative
 
02:49:16.790 --> 02:49:16.800 align:start position:0%
detection mention because I'm hoping
 
02:49:18.469 --> 02:49:18.479 align:start position:0%
that the judge will hold them and in the
 
02:49:20.349 --> 02:49:20.359 align:start position:0%
circuit court at least I've been able to
 
02:49:24.670 --> 02:49:24.680 align:start position:0%
tell the judge why I held them in the
 
02:49:29.590 --> 02:49:29.600 align:start position:0%
past pre 20108 if I held someone they'd
 
02:49:31.630 --> 02:49:31.640 align:start position:0%
usually be a week anyway before they had
 
02:49:34.750 --> 02:49:34.760 align:start position:0%
a bail hearing schedule to change that
 
02:49:37.429 --> 02:49:37.439 align:start position:0%
now they're usually out the next morning
 
02:49:39.269 --> 02:49:39.279 align:start position:0%
so the thing is it becomes a revolving
 
02:49:41.510 --> 02:49:41.520 align:start position:0%
door and the bail Commissioners always
 
02:49:43.110 --> 02:49:43.120 align:start position:0%
seemed to be the punching bag because we
 
02:49:45.309 --> 02:49:45.319 align:start position:0%
were the one that did the paperwork
 
02:49:48.269 --> 02:49:48.279 align:start position:0%
and it's like paperwork is the paperwork
 
02:49:49.830 --> 02:49:49.840 align:start position:0%
as she said and if you actually got to
 
02:49:52.790 --> 02:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
see the forms you might understand is
 
02:49:54.429 --> 02:49:54.439 align:start position:0%
this is the paperwork that we have to
 
02:49:56.710 --> 02:49:56.720 align:start position:0%
give to the court and that's all we send
 
02:49:59.110 --> 02:49:59.120 align:start position:0%
them and like I say in the circuit court
 
02:50:00.710 --> 02:50:00.720 align:start position:0%
at least we have the opportunity on the
 
02:50:02.830 --> 02:50:02.840 align:start position:0%
bottom of the page to say why we put
 
02:50:05.389 --> 02:50:05.399 align:start position:0%
them but it's only four lines and it's
 
02:50:07.469 --> 02:50:07.479 align:start position:0%
hard to get everything in in four
 
02:50:10.710 --> 02:50:10.720 align:start position:0%
lines agreed and um we do appreciate the
 
02:50:12.790 --> 02:50:12.800 align:start position:0%
reference we will be circulating those
 
02:50:14.750 --> 02:50:14.760 align:start position:0%
documents among we're going to make sure
 
02:50:16.349 --> 02:50:16.359 align:start position:0%
sure that we see what it is that you
 
02:50:18.389 --> 02:50:18.399 align:start position:0%
actually just make sure you leave T Bale
 
02:50:20.590 --> 02:50:20.600 align:start position:0%
in there that's a good thing yeah
 
02:50:22.349 --> 02:50:22.359 align:start position:0%
because otherwise it'd be police
 
02:50:23.990 --> 02:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
departments that would be still making
 
02:50:27.110 --> 02:50:27.120 align:start position:0%
phone calls I got a call from one over
 
02:50:29.830 --> 02:50:29.840 align:start position:0%
in Rochester I was the 20th call they
 
02:50:32.389 --> 02:50:32.399 align:start position:0%
placed for find a bail commissioner so
 
02:50:33.830 --> 02:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
bail Commissioners as a bail
 
02:50:35.550 --> 02:50:35.560 align:start position:0%
commissioner you can just say n not
 
02:50:37.309 --> 02:50:37.319 align:start position:0%
tonight I'm not I'm not taking it you
 
02:50:40.269 --> 02:50:40.279 align:start position:0%
can decline yeah um so yeah well some
 
02:50:42.110 --> 02:50:42.120 align:start position:0%
just don't answer the phone but I was
 
02:50:45.110 --> 02:50:45.120 align:start position:0%
always taught I know what it is I answer
 
02:50:48.110 --> 02:50:48.120 align:start position:0%
the phone and I'll tell them why and are
 
02:50:51.349 --> 02:50:51.359 align:start position:0%
you on call um
 
02:50:54.389 --> 02:50:54.399 align:start position:0%
247365 so on a holiday if you decide you
 
02:50:55.630 --> 02:50:55.640 align:start position:0%
know what I'm going to have a I'm going
 
02:50:58.590 --> 02:50:58.600 align:start position:0%
to have a couple Elations to celebrate
 
02:50:59.990 --> 02:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
you've kind of Taken yourself off the
 
02:51:02.670 --> 02:51:02.680 align:start position:0%
market and no one knows if someone else
 
02:51:06.070 --> 02:51:06.080 align:start position:0%
is there to fill it and yeah as the
 
02:51:08.429 --> 02:51:08.439 align:start position:0%
expression goes that's not my problem
 
02:51:10.950 --> 02:51:10.960 align:start position:0%
yeah other words I was set to bail out
 
02:51:13.070 --> 02:51:13.080 align:start position:0%
at a Franklin
 
02:51:16.429 --> 02:51:16.439 align:start position:0%
District it's small area but it kind of
 
02:51:18.990 --> 02:51:19.000 align:start position:0%
got up into Grafton County went into a
 
02:51:20.830 --> 02:51:20.840 align:start position:0%
little bit more in belnap County a
 
02:51:23.229 --> 02:51:23.239 align:start position:0%
little further out in meramac county and
 
02:51:25.070 --> 02:51:25.080 align:start position:0%
then it kind of became the six circuit
 
02:51:27.030 --> 02:51:27.040 align:start position:0%
which goes out into Hillsboro down into
 
02:51:29.510 --> 02:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
hookit and kind of taking that out and
 
02:51:31.910 --> 02:51:31.920 align:start position:0%
then Co hit and it became Statewide
 
02:51:33.469 --> 02:51:33.479 align:start position:0%
because once state troopers start to
 
02:51:35.309 --> 02:51:35.319 align:start position:0%
learn that someone is willing to do the
 
02:51:37.910 --> 02:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
paperwork and set up and figure it out
 
02:51:39.590 --> 02:51:39.600 align:start position:0%
they passed the word and it gets into
 
02:51:41.870 --> 02:51:41.880 align:start position:0%
police departments dispatch centers and
 
02:51:43.550 --> 02:51:43.560 align:start position:0%
your phone keeps
 
02:51:45.870 --> 02:51:45.880 align:start position:0%
ringing the punishment for doing your
 
02:51:49.429 --> 02:51:49.439 align:start position:0%
job yeah any questions oh I see a few
 
02:51:52.429 --> 02:51:52.439 align:start position:0%
okay represent will oh represent Stone
 
02:51:53.550 --> 02:51:53.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
02:51:55.870 --> 02:51:55.880 align:start position:0%
my question from an operational
 
02:51:57.309 --> 02:51:57.319 align:start position:0%
standpoint since you've been doing this
 
02:51:59.710 --> 02:51:59.720 align:start position:0%
for a while do you think it's feasible
 
02:52:01.670 --> 02:52:01.680 align:start position:0%
that since Hamshire has 13 cities and
 
02:52:03.750 --> 02:52:03.760 align:start position:0%
over 200 Towns at 15 magistrates will be
 
02:52:06.150 --> 02:52:06.160 align:start position:0%
able to keep up with the case load of
 
02:52:07.710 --> 02:52:07.720 align:start position:0%
what you currently have is approximately
 
02:52:09.070 --> 02:52:09.080 align:start position:0%
100 bail
 
02:52:11.750 --> 02:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
Commissioners well here's this the cold
 
02:52:14.150 --> 02:52:14.160 align:start position:0%
hard fact you got 15 people that have
 
02:52:15.790 --> 02:52:15.800 align:start position:0%
gone to work Monday through Friday from
 
02:52:18.349 --> 02:52:18.359 align:start position:0%
8:00 to 4: and you got 100 people that
 
02:52:21.190 --> 02:52:21.200 align:start position:0%
are working 24/7 365 and doesn't cost
 
02:52:22.790 --> 02:52:22.800 align:start position:0%
the state
 
02:52:25.630 --> 02:52:25.640 align:start position:0%
anything run the
 
02:52:29.309 --> 02:52:29.319 align:start position:0%
numbers we are cost effective and the
 
02:52:32.710 --> 02:52:32.720 align:start position:0%
thing is everything that I hear is one
 
02:52:34.590 --> 02:52:34.600 align:start position:0%
part of misinformation because people
 
02:52:37.670 --> 02:52:37.680 align:start position:0%
don't understand the biggest problem for
 
02:52:40.830 --> 02:52:40.840 align:start position:0%
us is communication with the court and
 
02:52:43.110 --> 02:52:43.120 align:start position:0%
being able to get a hold of somebody at
 
02:52:45.070 --> 02:52:45.080 align:start position:0%
3:00 in the morning when I've got
 
02:52:48.030 --> 02:52:48.040 align:start position:0%
something that makes absolutely no sense
 
02:52:49.790 --> 02:52:49.800 align:start position:0%
because I can't read what the judge
 
02:52:51.870 --> 02:52:51.880 align:start position:0%
wrote that's why I went out and I got
 
02:52:55.030 --> 02:52:55.040 align:start position:0%
the iPad so there was no thing so I
 
02:52:56.990 --> 02:52:57.000 align:start position:0%
can't tell the defendant what when I'm
 
02:52:59.190 --> 02:52:59.200 align:start position:0%
trying to release him what that is
 
02:53:01.870 --> 02:53:01.880 align:start position:0%
because I can't read it and yes we've
 
02:53:04.030 --> 02:53:04.040 align:start position:0%
complained up through the administrative
 
02:53:06.150 --> 02:53:06.160 align:start position:0%
office of the court and numerous times
 
02:53:08.990 --> 02:53:09.000 align:start position:0%
and we don't get phone calls back they
 
02:53:11.309 --> 02:53:11.319 align:start position:0%
just plain don't answer us I know we're
 
02:53:12.830 --> 02:53:12.840 align:start position:0%
lower than whale crap we're at the
 
02:53:14.229 --> 02:53:14.239 align:start position:0%
bottom of the peack and order we
 
02:53:15.950 --> 02:53:15.960 align:start position:0%
understand understand that and we deal
 
02:53:18.990 --> 02:53:19.000 align:start position:0%
with it but you know the thing is the
 
02:53:20.790 --> 02:53:20.800 align:start position:0%
only time I think I'll hear from them if
 
02:53:23.469 --> 02:53:23.479 align:start position:0%
I screw something up
 
02:53:26.150 --> 02:53:26.160 align:start position:0%
maybe so um that brings up an
 
02:53:29.630 --> 02:53:29.640 align:start position:0%
interesting question is the very fact
 
02:53:31.070 --> 02:53:31.080 align:start position:0%
that you're having to decipher
 
02:53:33.510 --> 02:53:33.520 align:start position:0%
handwriting um it's that it's not
 
02:53:35.750 --> 02:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
electronically printed out you're
 
02:53:37.309 --> 02:53:37.319 align:start position:0%
actually reading like doctor's
 
02:53:39.469 --> 02:53:39.479 align:start position:0%
prescriptions uh at 3 in the morning uh
 
02:53:41.670 --> 02:53:41.680 align:start position:0%
no doctor's prescriptions I can usually
 
02:53:43.030 --> 02:53:43.040 align:start position:0%
figure out because it looks like my
 
02:53:45.750 --> 02:53:45.760 align:start position:0%
handwriting this is even more worse I
 
02:53:48.389 --> 02:53:48.399 align:start position:0%
mean it's just it's like a pen just
 
02:53:50.830 --> 02:53:50.840 align:start position:0%
pencil one writes in pencil and it lays
 
02:53:53.469 --> 02:53:53.479 align:start position:0%
it on the side and it's kind of Flowery
 
02:53:55.349 --> 02:53:55.359 align:start position:0%
and it just becomes a smudge across the
 
02:53:57.950 --> 02:53:57.960 align:start position:0%
paper you can't read anything we had six
 
02:53:59.269 --> 02:53:59.279 align:start position:0%
people trying to figure it out at the
 
02:54:01.950 --> 02:54:01.960 align:start position:0%
jail one night and it was someone that
 
02:54:03.910 --> 02:54:03.920 align:start position:0%
we really didn't want to
 
02:54:06.429 --> 02:54:06.439 align:start position:0%
release but we couldn't tell them what
 
02:54:07.990 --> 02:54:08.000 align:start position:0%
they were supposed to do and where they
 
02:54:11.110 --> 02:54:11.120 align:start position:0%
couldn't go because we couldn't read
 
02:54:13.550 --> 02:54:13.560 align:start position:0%
it so we went back to the police
 
02:54:15.269 --> 02:54:15.279 align:start position:0%
department and we got the original
 
02:54:17.070 --> 02:54:17.080 align:start position:0%
information we're able to in other words
 
02:54:19.389 --> 02:54:19.399 align:start position:0%
we made it happen because we know that
 
02:54:22.389 --> 02:54:22.399 align:start position:0%
there's other ways to do it but it's not
 
02:54:24.630 --> 02:54:24.640 align:start position:0%
it's a great straightforward way we
 
02:54:26.990 --> 02:54:27.000 align:start position:0%
should have basically a clerk available
 
02:54:30.070 --> 02:54:30.080 align:start position:0%
to us or a judge available to us 247
 
02:54:31.750 --> 02:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
like the police do so if we get
 
02:54:34.110 --> 02:54:34.120 align:start position:0%
something that's never happened before
 
02:54:35.590 --> 02:54:35.600 align:start position:0%
or how to deal with it we at least have
 
02:54:37.990 --> 02:54:38.000 align:start position:0%
someone to run something by we used to
 
02:54:39.670 --> 02:54:39.680 align:start position:0%
have that with the older judges that
 
02:54:42.910 --> 02:54:42.920 align:start position:0%
have since retired the newer
 
02:54:45.590 --> 02:54:45.600 align:start position:0%
judges they no hey that's your job you
 
02:54:47.510 --> 02:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
set the bail we don't do that so I can't
 
02:54:49.510 --> 02:54:49.520 align:start position:0%
advise you I'm not looking for
 
02:54:51.269 --> 02:54:51.279 align:start position:0%
advisement on what I'm going to do I'm
 
02:54:54.030 --> 02:54:54.040 align:start position:0%
looking for process and you deal deal
 
02:54:56.429 --> 02:54:56.439 align:start position:0%
with process so that's some of the
 
02:54:59.030 --> 02:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
challenges that we've had not everyone
 
02:55:01.870 --> 02:55:01.880 align:start position:0%
has it but I'm also an advocate for in
 
02:55:03.550 --> 02:55:03.560 align:start position:0%
other words when I go down when
 
02:55:05.190 --> 02:55:05.200 align:start position:0%
someone's coming into the jail with you
 
02:55:08.349 --> 02:55:08.359 align:start position:0%
know cash bail they wait an hour usually
 
02:55:10.550 --> 02:55:10.560 align:start position:0%
before someone gets there but they've
 
02:55:12.950 --> 02:55:12.960 align:start position:0%
had to wait until they've processed all
 
02:55:14.590 --> 02:55:14.600 align:start position:0%
the money through made sure everything
 
02:55:16.110 --> 02:55:16.120 align:start position:0%
was there that they weren't the
 
02:55:17.670 --> 02:55:17.680 align:start position:0%
protected party or someone they had to
 
02:55:20.269 --> 02:55:20.279 align:start position:0%
stay away with before they call us so
 
02:55:21.670 --> 02:55:21.680 align:start position:0%
once we get down there so I'm more
 
02:55:23.269 --> 02:55:23.279 align:start position:0%
concerned about the bailing party that's
 
02:55:25.630 --> 02:55:25.640 align:start position:0%
come down or driven up we've had them
 
02:55:27.630 --> 02:55:27.640 align:start position:0%
come up from Massachusetts and they
 
02:55:29.630 --> 02:55:29.640 align:start position:0%
couldn't get a bail commissioner and
 
02:55:30.910 --> 02:55:30.920 align:start position:0%
they had to go away and come back
 
02:55:33.710 --> 02:55:33.720 align:start position:0%
another day because of that you know
 
02:55:34.910 --> 02:55:34.920 align:start position:0%
there's all kinds of things that are
 
02:55:36.550 --> 02:55:36.560 align:start position:0%
going on out there that shouldn't but
 
02:55:39.990 --> 02:55:40.000 align:start position:0%
they do and it's like it's the totality
 
02:55:42.349 --> 02:55:42.359 align:start position:0%
of what you need to look at but I think
 
02:55:44.349 --> 02:55:44.359 align:start position:0%
what you've heard from some take a a
 
02:55:46.190 --> 02:55:46.200 align:start position:0%
good hard look at the laws and see how
 
02:55:47.750 --> 02:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
they're going to affect anything north
 
02:55:47.760 --> 02:55:48.750 align:start position:0%
they're going to affect anything north
of

02:55:48.750 --> 02:55:48.760 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:55:51.309 --> 02:55:51.319 align:start position:0%
hookit because as you start to go up
 
02:55:53.150 --> 02:55:53.160 align:start position:0%
north or you get over to the western
 
02:55:54.910 --> 02:55:54.920 align:start position:0%
side of the state or the Eastern going
 
02:55:57.950 --> 02:55:57.960 align:start position:0%
up things change dramatically once the
 
02:56:00.510 --> 02:56:00.520 align:start position:0%
population goes down is the tax baces
 
02:56:01.990 --> 02:56:02.000 align:start position:0%
that are supporting those police
 
02:56:04.710 --> 02:56:04.720 align:start position:0%
departments they're not very large and
 
02:56:06.229 --> 02:56:06.239 align:start position:0%
some of the courts are not full-time
 
02:56:08.429 --> 02:56:08.439 align:start position:0%
courts they're part-time courts so they
 
02:56:10.269 --> 02:56:10.279 align:start position:0%
don't have a regular
 
02:56:13.190 --> 02:56:13.200 align:start position:0%
schedule at least with Superior Court we
 
02:56:15.790 --> 02:56:15.800 align:start position:0%
know but the we have to guess especially
 
02:56:18.269 --> 02:56:18.279 align:start position:0%
if the police officers don't know that
 
02:56:20.429 --> 02:56:20.439 align:start position:0%
becomes challenging so you could set a
 
02:56:22.990 --> 02:56:23.000 align:start position:0%
court date for a defendant to appear
 
02:56:25.110 --> 02:56:25.120 align:start position:0%
that there may not even be a judge there
 
02:56:28.429 --> 02:56:28.439 align:start position:0%
that day so what I do is I cheat I find
 
02:56:31.670 --> 02:56:31.680 align:start position:0%
the biggest town that's 24 hours in that
 
02:56:33.750 --> 02:56:33.760 align:start position:0%
court and I call and give me a valid
 
02:56:36.349 --> 02:56:36.359 align:start position:0%
court date so at least I know that on
 
02:56:37.790 --> 02:56:37.800 align:start position:0%
that date there's going to be a judge
 
02:56:40.750 --> 02:56:40.760 align:start position:0%
there there may be an unhappy prosecutor
 
02:56:42.750 --> 02:56:42.760 align:start position:0%
but at least we get them in to see the
 
02:56:46.070 --> 02:56:46.080 align:start position:0%
judge on a valid court date or sometimes
 
02:56:48.070 --> 02:56:48.080 align:start position:0%
what the court will do is they'll mail a
 
02:56:50.269 --> 02:56:50.279 align:start position:0%
new court date to the person because
 
02:56:52.429 --> 02:56:52.439 align:start position:0%
they'll realize that there is no judge
 
02:56:55.910 --> 02:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
available it sounds like um perhaps new
 
02:56:58.110 --> 02:56:58.120 align:start position:0%
judges need to Shadow a bail
 
02:57:01.070 --> 02:57:01.080 align:start position:0%
commissioner instead of it goes back to
 
02:57:03.269 --> 02:57:03.279 align:start position:0%
the thing it's it's training for all of
 
02:57:06.750 --> 02:57:06.760 align:start position:0%
us so that we all understand and then
 
02:57:08.790 --> 02:57:08.800 align:start position:0%
sometimes it maybe is the old addage
 
02:57:10.550 --> 02:57:10.560 align:start position:0%
years to go you get the judges the bail
 
02:57:11.910 --> 02:57:11.920 align:start position:0%
Commissioners and the police and the
 
02:57:14.830 --> 02:57:14.840 align:start position:0%
prosecutors together and have the
 
02:57:16.910 --> 02:57:16.920 align:start position:0%
conversation and so that that way
 
02:57:19.389 --> 02:57:19.399 align:start position:0%
everybody gets to hear the same thing at
 
02:57:21.510 --> 02:57:21.520 align:start position:0%
the same time and it makes things a lot
 
02:57:35.630 --> 02:57:35.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:38.190 --> 02:57:38.200 align:start position:0%
everyone don't worry you'll be back
 
02:57:40.110 --> 02:57:40.120 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler thank you Mr
 
02:57:43.990 --> 02:57:44.000 align:start position:0%
chair um this seems like such a
 
02:57:47.150 --> 02:57:47.160 align:start position:0%
thankless job I'm curious as to what
 
02:57:49.550 --> 02:57:49.560 align:start position:0%
initially attracted you to want to
 
02:57:51.349 --> 02:57:51.359 align:start position:0%
become a bail commissioner and how we
 
02:57:54.190 --> 02:57:54.200 align:start position:0%
could get truth younger or more people
 
02:57:56.870 --> 02:57:56.880 align:start position:0%
to to do what you have served the public
 
02:57:59.429 --> 02:57:59.439 align:start position:0%
to do for the the other last however
 
02:58:03.429 --> 02:58:03.439 align:start position:0%
many years honest nothing actually
 
02:58:05.950 --> 02:58:05.960 align:start position:0%
attracted me to being a bail
 
02:58:09.190 --> 02:58:09.200 align:start position:0%
commissioner I'm a retired police chief
 
02:58:11.309 --> 02:58:11.319 align:start position:0%
and I had three police Chiefs come to me
 
02:58:13.349 --> 02:58:13.359 align:start position:0%
and say we need a bail commissioner
 
02:58:16.389 --> 02:58:16.399 align:start position:0%
you've been retire a year can you help
 
02:58:20.030 --> 02:58:20.040 align:start position:0%
us how could I say no because having
 
02:58:22.550 --> 02:58:22.560 align:start position:0%
been a police chief I was at the mercy
 
02:58:24.590 --> 02:58:24.600 align:start position:0%
of bail Commissioners because they were
 
02:58:27.309 --> 02:58:27.319 align:start position:0%
unavailable so it was like well yeah
 
02:58:30.349 --> 02:58:30.359 align:start position:0%
that's how I did it but on the flip side
 
02:58:33.070 --> 02:58:33.080 align:start position:0%
I'm getting older this forces me to keep
 
02:58:36.269 --> 02:58:36.279 align:start position:0%
my brain active I have to stay up on the
 
02:58:39.030 --> 02:58:39.040 align:start position:0%
statutes I like to read them so that I
 
02:58:41.510 --> 02:58:41.520 align:start position:0%
understand the nuances and the things is
 
02:58:44.190 --> 02:58:44.200 align:start position:0%
what I can do and after the bus settled
 
02:58:47.429 --> 02:58:47.439 align:start position:0%
on the 2018 bail reform I went back and
 
02:58:49.670 --> 02:58:49.680 align:start position:0%
I looked at the law the law hadn't
 
02:58:51.870 --> 02:58:51.880 align:start position:0%
really changed it was the attitude of
 
02:58:53.710 --> 02:58:53.720 align:start position:0%
how we were looking at things had
 
02:58:56.309 --> 02:58:56.319 align:start position:0%
changed and we just started sliding
 
02:58:58.750 --> 02:58:58.760 align:start position:0%
things in because I was asked to go down
 
02:59:02.190 --> 02:59:02.200 align:start position:0%
to Manchester to bail and one night I
 
02:59:04.510 --> 02:59:04.520 align:start position:0%
was there I sent I think three people
 
02:59:06.309 --> 02:59:06.319 align:start position:0%
preventative detention to Valley Street
 
02:59:09.110 --> 02:59:09.120 align:start position:0%
jail sent one on 5,000 cash and one on
 
02:59:09.120 --> 02:59:10.750 align:start position:0%
jail sent one on 5,000 cash and one on
10,000

02:59:10.750 --> 02:59:10.760 align:start position:0%
10,000
 
02:59:13.910 --> 02:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
cash and I didn't get a note from the
 
02:59:15.229 --> 02:59:15.239 align:start position:0%
caught or
 
02:59:18.670 --> 02:59:18.680 align:start position:0%
anything so the thing is it's you know
 
02:59:23.150 --> 02:59:23.160 align:start position:0%
it's doable but the thing is we have to
 
02:59:26.469 --> 02:59:26.479 align:start position:0%
justify what we've done and I have to be
 
02:59:28.710 --> 02:59:28.720 align:start position:0%
able to explain if I get called by the
 
02:59:31.710 --> 02:59:31.720 align:start position:0%
judge why I did what I did so the thing
 
02:59:34.070 --> 02:59:34.080 align:start position:0%
is everything we do is you got to do it
 
02:59:35.830 --> 02:59:35.840 align:start position:0%
objectively you can't be subjective
 
02:59:37.870 --> 02:59:37.880 align:start position:0%
about it you got to have the facts in
 
02:59:40.190 --> 02:59:40.200 align:start position:0%
front of you and based on those facts
 
02:59:43.429 --> 02:59:43.439 align:start position:0%
you make the condition that certain
 
02:59:45.950 --> 02:59:45.960 align:start position:0%
things need to be done and if you can't
 
02:59:47.790 --> 02:59:47.800 align:start position:0%
quite get them to jail it might be cash
 
02:59:49.990 --> 02:59:50.000 align:start position:0%
bail might be the better way to do it
 
02:59:52.110 --> 02:59:52.120 align:start position:0%
because if they can raise the money they
 
02:59:53.950 --> 02:59:53.960 align:start position:0%
don't but if they can't they still go to
 
02:59:57.070 --> 02:59:57.080 align:start position:0%
jail then they see the judge so the
 
02:59:59.190 --> 02:59:59.200 align:start position:0%
thing is the end result you get almost
 
03:00:01.910 --> 03:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:04.429 --> 03:00:04.439 align:start position:0%
thing I appreciate your testimony and
 
03:00:06.550 --> 03:00:06.560 align:start position:0%
I'm more sure we'll be conducting these
 
03:00:08.590 --> 03:00:08.600 align:start position:0%
hearings first and next month so I'm
 
03:00:10.590 --> 03:00:10.600 align:start position:0%
sure we'll see you again and uh we'll
 
03:00:13.030 --> 03:00:13.040 align:start position:0%
have more questions oh oh I'm sorry
 
03:00:15.070 --> 03:00:15.080 align:start position:0%
representative gaff
 
03:00:18.110 --> 03:00:18.120 align:start position:0%
right thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
03:00:20.670 --> 03:00:20.680 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I'm just curious
 
03:00:22.630 --> 03:00:22.640 align:start position:0%
because I remember that there was a bill
 
03:00:25.910 --> 03:00:25.920 align:start position:0%
from the Senate um where they wanted to
 
03:00:28.070 --> 03:00:28.080 align:start position:0%
make sure that the Commissioners got
 
03:00:30.550 --> 03:00:30.560 align:start position:0%
paid and I know that the Commissioners
 
03:00:33.590 --> 03:00:33.600 align:start position:0%
came and basically told us not to vote
 
03:00:37.070 --> 03:00:37.080 align:start position:0%
for the bill which we did listen and um
 
03:00:39.790 --> 03:00:39.800 align:start position:0%
we basically killed the bill but I'm
 
03:00:43.030 --> 03:00:43.040 align:start position:0%
just not trying to understand why was it
 
03:00:46.429 --> 03:00:46.439 align:start position:0%
that the commissioner did not want um
 
03:00:48.710 --> 03:00:48.720 align:start position:0%
the state to intervene to make sure you
 
03:01:12.630 --> 03:01:12.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:12.640 --> 03:01:15.229 align:start position:0%
 
$40

03:01:15.229 --> 03:01:15.239 align:start position:0%
$40
 
03:01:19.750 --> 03:01:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:19.760 --> 03:01:30.030 align:start position:0%
 
beached

03:01:30.030 --> 03:01:30.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:33.590 --> 03:01:33.600 align:start position:0%
notun let's fix and get us paid first
 
03:01:36.110 --> 03:01:36.120 align:start position:0%
before you start increasing fees or
 
03:01:39.590 --> 03:01:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:42.550 --> 03:01:42.560 align:start position:0%
we so um you felt like it was going to
 
03:01:44.110 --> 03:01:44.120 align:start position:0%
jeopardize getting being paid for your
 
03:01:46.429 --> 03:01:46.439 align:start position:0%
bail fees in the first place by asking
 
03:01:49.990 --> 03:01:50.000 align:start position:0%
for even more um and then then they also
 
03:01:52.110 --> 03:01:52.120 align:start position:0%
the flip side was can we bring it up to
 
03:01:55.429 --> 03:01:55.439 align:start position:0%
$50 no leave it at $40 just pay us the
 
03:01:58.990 --> 03:01:59.000 align:start position:0%
$40 but that was that was before the
 
03:02:02.950 --> 03:02:02.960 align:start position:0%
last three years of extreme expenses so
 
03:02:04.630 --> 03:02:04.640 align:start position:0%
the thing is you probably going to have
 
03:02:06.429 --> 03:02:06.439 align:start position:0%
to revisit that if this thing doesn't
 
03:02:09.030 --> 03:02:09.040 align:start position:0%
change there's a post postage when I
 
03:02:11.830 --> 03:02:11.840 align:start position:0%
started I think was 40 some OD cents
 
03:02:14.830 --> 03:02:14.840 align:start position:0%
it's now 66 cents and the thing is you
 
03:02:17.550 --> 03:02:17.560 align:start position:0%
talk about nickel and diamond where I've
 
03:02:20.030 --> 03:02:20.040 align:start position:0%
showed you that I'm over $51,000 in the
 
03:02:21.990 --> 03:02:22.000 align:start position:0%
hole since I've been doing this so the
 
03:02:23.830 --> 03:02:23.840 align:start position:0%
thing is plus supplies and everything
 
03:02:27.269 --> 03:02:27.279 align:start position:0%
else that $40 isn't $40 in
 
03:02:29.910 --> 03:02:29.920 align:start position:0%
reality and then when you figure only 60
 
03:02:33.229 --> 03:02:33.239 align:start position:0%
to 62 to 68% collecting that's part of
 
03:02:36.030 --> 03:02:36.040 align:start position:0%
the challenge so to go back to your
 
03:02:38.990 --> 03:02:39.000 align:start position:0%
question again we're the only ones in
 
03:02:41.229 --> 03:02:41.239 align:start position:0%
the Judiciary that don't get paid on a
 
03:02:43.630 --> 03:02:43.640 align:start position:0%
regular basis and when we go out to to
 
03:02:45.630 --> 03:02:45.640 align:start position:0%
do the work we don't know whether we
 
03:02:48.389 --> 03:02:48.399 align:start position:0%
will or we won't because we I was told
 
03:02:50.510 --> 03:02:50.520 align:start position:0%
at least I can't ask do they have the
 
03:02:53.830 --> 03:02:53.840 align:start position:0%
bail fee because that's grounds from my
 
03:02:56.670 --> 03:02:56.680 align:start position:0%
termination I was told however I know
 
03:02:58.389 --> 03:02:58.399 align:start position:0%
that there are bail Commissioners that
 
03:03:01.110 --> 03:03:01.120 align:start position:0%
ask and say no I'm not coming out and
 
03:03:02.790 --> 03:03:02.800 align:start position:0%
they hang
 
03:03:05.070 --> 03:03:05.080 align:start position:0%
up just so I do it I want to do a
 
03:03:07.870 --> 03:03:07.880 align:start position:0%
listening check you have been doing this
 
03:03:09.750 --> 03:03:09.760 align:start position:0%
for seven years just the baill seven and
 
03:03:12.469 --> 03:03:12.479 align:start position:0%
a half seven and A2 and in seven and A2
 
03:03:16.710 --> 03:03:16.720 align:start position:0%
years you are 50 $1,000 in the whole in
 
03:03:18.790 --> 03:03:18.800 align:start position:0%
just bail fees not talking about your
 
03:03:20.830 --> 03:03:20.840 align:start position:0%
own expenses and mileage or anything
 
03:03:23.349 --> 03:03:23.359 align:start position:0%
else $5
 
03:03:27.990 --> 03:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
51,3 to be exact and that was as of uh
 
03:03:28.000 --> 03:03:29.510 align:start position:0%
51,3 to be exact and that was as of uh
913

03:03:29.510 --> 03:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
913
 
03:03:32.150 --> 03:03:32.160 align:start position:0%
23 it's gone up since
 
03:03:35.229 --> 03:03:35.239 align:start position:0%
then thank you represent GA did you have
 
03:03:35.239 --> 03:03:35.470 align:start position:0%
then thank you represent GA did you have
a

03:03:35.470 --> 03:03:35.480 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:03:35.480 --> 03:03:37.469 align:start position:0%
a
[Music]

03:03:37.469 --> 03:03:37.479 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:03:41.389 --> 03:03:41.399 align:start position:0%
followup so with that said um have you
 
03:03:44.429 --> 03:03:44.439 align:start position:0%
um actually talked to to anyone in the
 
03:03:46.510 --> 03:03:46.520 align:start position:0%
senate about that
 
03:03:51.030 --> 03:03:51.040 align:start position:0%
$40 fee in terms of a bill to address
 
03:03:53.590 --> 03:03:53.600 align:start position:0%
that issue since you did not want the
 
03:03:56.309 --> 03:03:56.319 align:start position:0%
one that you said was related to um
 
03:03:58.429 --> 03:03:58.439 align:start position:0%
traveling that was mileage yes we were
 
03:04:01.309 --> 03:04:01.319 align:start position:0%
told that it would be taken care
 
03:04:05.070 --> 03:04:05.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:08.030 --> 03:04:08.040 align:start position:0%
out see that was the nicest way I think
 
03:04:10.070 --> 03:04:10.080 align:start position:0%
I could put it and not put my foot in up
 
03:04:16.110 --> 03:04:16.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:27.630 --> 03:04:27.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:30.910 --> 03:04:30.920 align:start position:0%
melie she was faor of getting us our
 
03:04:35.790 --> 03:04:35.800 align:start position:0%
money but it was just trying
 
03:04:39.429 --> 03:04:39.439 align:start position:0%
to you know get it through the
 
03:04:42.349 --> 03:04:42.359 align:start position:0%
committee the committee
 
03:04:42.359 --> 03:04:44.229 align:start position:0%
committee the committee
just

03:04:44.229 --> 03:04:44.239 align:start position:0%
just
 
03:04:50.070 --> 03:04:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:53.550 --> 03:04:53.560 align:start position:0%
concentrating other exous things I
 
03:04:57.150 --> 03:04:57.160 align:start position:0%
remember the chief in Rochester was on
 
03:04:58.870 --> 03:04:58.880 align:start position:0%
and he
 
03:05:01.670 --> 03:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
testified what was he said something
 
03:05:03.429 --> 03:05:03.439 align:start position:0%
about we might as well turn this whole
 
03:05:03.439 --> 03:05:04.750 align:start position:0%
about we might as well turn this whole
thing

03:05:04.750 --> 03:05:04.760 align:start position:0%
thing
 
03:05:08.790 --> 03:05:08.800 align:start position:0%
over cash and I'll never
 
03:05:15.510 --> 03:05:15.520 align:start position:0%
forget because it is I mean somebody he
 
03:05:19.030 --> 03:05:19.040 align:start position:0%
they some guy that was doing bur eight
 
03:05:22.870 --> 03:05:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:26.070 --> 03:05:26.080 align:start position:0%
and and that's when it
 
03:05:33.750 --> 03:05:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:37.150 --> 03:05:37.160 align:start position:0%
times thank you
 
03:05:41.070 --> 03:05:41.080 align:start position:0%
just it's not you know it's not ever
 
03:05:43.790 --> 03:05:43.800 align:start position:0%
been I don't think well out
 
03:05:45.910 --> 03:05:45.920 align:start position:0%
that's what we're trying to do just just
 
03:05:45.920 --> 03:05:51.630 align:start position:0%
that's what we're trying to do just just
so

03:05:51.630 --> 03:05:51.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:55.030 --> 03:05:55.040 align:start position:0%
you but but again A lot has to do too is
 
03:05:57.269 --> 03:05:57.279 align:start position:0%
the police departments if they happen to
 
03:06:00.389 --> 03:06:00.399 align:start position:0%
ask can you hold this person and then
 
03:06:03.070 --> 03:06:03.080 align:start position:0%
actually tell you why and not have to
 
03:06:05.429 --> 03:06:05.439 align:start position:0%
fight to get it out of them because I
 
03:06:08.990 --> 03:06:09.000 align:start position:0%
had a one where I bailed up in havil
 
03:06:11.910 --> 03:06:11.920 align:start position:0%
gentlemen had all kinds of stuff and
 
03:06:14.229 --> 03:06:14.239 align:start position:0%
they wanted PR bail
 
03:06:16.710 --> 03:06:16.720 align:start position:0%
had no criminal record had nothing so I
 
03:06:19.110 --> 03:06:19.120 align:start position:0%
mean there was you know just nothing
 
03:06:20.510 --> 03:06:20.520 align:start position:0%
that you could say that you could meet
 
03:06:23.150 --> 03:06:23.160 align:start position:0%
the requirements to hold him well the
 
03:06:25.269 --> 03:06:25.279 align:start position:0%
nice thing was after I let him out on
 
03:06:28.110 --> 03:06:28.120 align:start position:0%
conditions he must have found a spot to
 
03:06:30.110 --> 03:06:30.120 align:start position:0%
hang out until he could go pick up his
 
03:06:32.950 --> 03:06:32.960 align:start position:0%
vehicle which was on a 24-hour hold or
 
03:06:35.269 --> 03:06:35.279 align:start position:0%
12-hour hold and he got in the car and
 
03:06:37.469 --> 03:06:37.479 align:start position:0%
left havil and went into
 
03:06:40.429 --> 03:06:40.439 align:start position:0%
pedmont and he got stopped
 
03:06:42.790 --> 03:06:42.800 align:start position:0%
there and the chief happened to stop and
 
03:06:44.790 --> 03:06:44.800 align:start position:0%
he noticed he saw the bail paperwork so
 
03:06:47.630 --> 03:06:47.640 align:start position:0%
he called me he says I've got this
 
03:06:49.750 --> 03:06:49.760 align:start position:0%
person said for
 
03:06:52.670 --> 03:06:52.680 align:start position:0%
what and he said would you be open to
 
03:06:54.750 --> 03:06:54.760 align:start position:0%
holding him I said well there was no
 
03:06:56.590 --> 03:06:56.600 align:start position:0%
doubt about that I just told him he
 
03:06:58.349 --> 03:06:58.359 align:start position:0%
couldn't do all of that and we haven't
 
03:06:59.990 --> 03:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
even got 12 hours
 
03:07:03.389 --> 03:07:03.399 align:start position:0%
here so he went up to the Grafton County
 
03:07:06.309 --> 03:07:06.319 align:start position:0%
jail so the thing is it a lot of times
 
03:07:06.319 --> 03:07:07.590 align:start position:0%
jail so the thing is it a lot of times
it's

03:07:07.590 --> 03:07:07.600 align:start position:0%
it's
 
03:07:10.150 --> 03:07:10.160 align:start position:0%
situational it sounds like that was luck
 
03:07:12.110 --> 03:07:12.120 align:start position:0%
I mean had he not seen the bail
 
03:07:14.710 --> 03:07:14.720 align:start position:0%
paperwork to know that that guy was on
 
03:07:17.710 --> 03:07:17.720 align:start position:0%
bail that where he called me so I mean
 
03:07:19.309 --> 03:07:19.319 align:start position:0%
otherwise so another bail commissioner
 
03:07:20.830 --> 03:07:20.840 align:start position:0%
would have been in the same thing
 
03:07:23.750 --> 03:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
there's no record with no record it's
 
03:07:27.229 --> 03:07:27.239 align:start position:0%
hard to but then again within 12 hours
 
03:07:29.229 --> 03:07:29.239 align:start position:0%
you got a little bit to build something
 
03:07:30.950 --> 03:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
depending upon the nature of the crimes
 
03:07:33.550 --> 03:07:33.560 align:start position:0%
too and you know some things there
 
03:07:35.110 --> 03:07:35.120 align:start position:0%
they're what you call
 
03:07:36.950 --> 03:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
no-brainers you know like the door
 
03:07:39.229 --> 03:07:39.239 align:start position:0%
nailed up you know that that's kind of
 
03:07:41.630 --> 03:07:41.640 align:start position:0%
like no you definitely need to see
 
03:07:44.030 --> 03:07:44.040 align:start position:0%
somebody and it's above my pay grade so
 
03:07:46.790 --> 03:07:46.800 align:start position:0%
preventative detention and it seems that
 
03:07:48.349 --> 03:07:48.359 align:start position:0%
he was going to go back and try it again
 
03:07:51.150 --> 03:07:51.160 align:start position:0%
so that goes to show that yeah okay no
 
03:07:53.469 --> 03:07:53.479 align:start position:0%
would have been a right call thank you
 
03:07:54.910 --> 03:07:54.920 align:start position:0%
you're welcome all right thank you for
 
03:07:57.309 --> 03:07:57.319 align:start position:0%
your testimony um I believe that's it
 
03:07:59.510 --> 03:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
for the bail Commissioners um and I
 
03:08:02.070 --> 03:08:02.080 align:start position:0%
think um you'll agree with me we've had
 
03:08:04.590 --> 03:08:04.600 align:start position:0%
a lot of enlightening testimony and a
 
03:08:07.670 --> 03:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
lot of information um so I'm going to
 
03:08:09.750 --> 03:08:09.760 align:start position:0%
give everybody a little homework before
 
03:08:11.830 --> 03:08:11.840 align:start position:0%
we meet again
 
03:08:15.830 --> 03:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
um yeah yes please um have a have a this
 
03:08:17.750 --> 03:08:17.760 align:start position:0%
is what you can copy it if you want
 
03:08:19.110 --> 03:08:19.120 align:start position:0%
that's what we're going to do it's just
 
03:08:22.349 --> 03:08:22.359 align:start position:0%
what I give out to all the telic towns
 
03:08:23.990 --> 03:08:24.000 align:start position:0%

03:08:33.710 --> 03:08:33.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:33.720 --> 03:08:36.070 align:start position:0%
 
circuits

03:08:36.070 --> 03:08:36.080 align:start position:0%
circuits
 
03:08:41.990 --> 03:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:42.000 --> 03:08:45.030 align:start position:0%
 
emails

03:08:45.030 --> 03:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:48.429 --> 03:08:48.439 align:start position:0%
so yeah they have a fax machine spit
 
03:08:50.190 --> 03:08:50.200 align:start position:0%
somebody has to pick it up okay thank
 
03:08:53.469 --> 03:08:53.479 align:start position:0%

03:08:55.110 --> 03:08:55.120 align:start position:0%
everyone please if you could go to that
 
03:08:56.990 --> 03:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
website and look at those forms so that
 
03:08:59.269 --> 03:08:59.279 align:start position:0%
we can have an intelligent discussion uh
 
03:09:02.910 --> 03:09:02.920 align:start position:0%
tomorrow about about those forms and and
 
03:09:05.429 --> 03:09:05.439 align:start position:0%
um I'll I'll figure out tonight where to
 
03:09:07.030 --> 03:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
take us tomorrow I think we've heard
 
03:09:09.229 --> 03:09:09.239 align:start position:0%
enough about the the crimes I think we
 
03:09:10.630 --> 03:09:10.640 align:start position:0%
need to one thing we haven't discussed
 
03:09:12.269 --> 03:09:12.279 align:start position:0%
is flight we've talked a lot about
 
03:09:12.279 --> 03:09:13.670 align:start position:0%
is flight we've talked a lot about
dangerousness

03:09:13.670 --> 03:09:13.680 align:start position:0%
dangerousness
 
03:09:15.790 --> 03:09:15.800 align:start position:0%
I'd like to discuss Flight Risk of
 
03:09:17.309 --> 03:09:17.319 align:start position:0%
flight there's the two grounds someone
 
03:09:19.269 --> 03:09:19.279 align:start position:0%
could be held on that they're a danger
 
03:09:21.269 --> 03:09:21.279 align:start position:0%
to themselves or the community or their
 
03:09:23.710 --> 03:09:23.720 align:start position:0%
risk of flight so we haven't heard much
 
03:09:25.070 --> 03:09:25.080 align:start position:0%
about flight so tomorrow we're going to
 
03:09:26.910 --> 03:09:26.920 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit about that and we'll
 
03:09:28.269 --> 03:09:28.279 align:start position:0%
see where that starts that that
 
03:09:30.830 --> 03:09:30.840 align:start position:0%
conversation takes us tomorrow um as I
 
03:09:32.550 --> 03:09:32.560 align:start position:0%
said next Thursday um we have a
 
03:09:34.229 --> 03:09:34.239 align:start position:0%
representative from Finance is going to
 
03:09:36.349 --> 03:09:36.359 align:start position:0%
come in here so I'd like to have a kind
 
03:09:39.790 --> 03:09:39.800 align:start position:0%
of a a conceptual idea of how much money
 
03:09:42.590 --> 03:09:42.600 align:start position:0%
we may need and what for so far we know
 
03:09:44.790 --> 03:09:44.800 align:start position:0%
that we are going to definitely and I
 
03:09:46.070 --> 03:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
hope you all agree with me that we're
 
03:09:48.469 --> 03:09:48.479 align:start position:0%
not leaving here unless we we have these
 
03:09:51.469 --> 03:09:51.479 align:start position:0%
these people paid um that I'm done with
 
03:09:54.710 --> 03:09:54.720 align:start position:0%
that um so that's going to be um part of
 
03:09:58.309 --> 03:09:58.319 align:start position:0%
it and um I we're going to be asking for
 
03:10:01.910 --> 03:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
some money um for the technology piece I
 
03:10:04.030 --> 03:10:04.040 align:start position:0%
think we may have to temporarily fund a
 
03:10:06.190 --> 03:10:06.200 align:start position:0%
few positions in the court and the way
 
03:10:07.870 --> 03:10:07.880 align:start position:0%
that would work is we would ask them to
 
03:10:09.790 --> 03:10:09.800 align:start position:0%
tell us how much it would cost for X Y
 
03:10:11.790 --> 03:10:11.800 align:start position:0%
and Z employees until your next budget
 
03:10:13.830 --> 03:10:13.840 align:start position:0%
year and then it's up to you to put it
 
03:10:17.070 --> 03:10:17.080 align:start position:0%
in your budget to to redo it right so
 
03:10:18.190 --> 03:10:18.200 align:start position:0%
we're going to we're going to have to
 
03:10:20.550 --> 03:10:20.560 align:start position:0%
put together a ballpark and then as we
 
03:10:22.030 --> 03:10:22.040 align:start position:0%
get towards the end of the process at
 
03:10:24.670 --> 03:10:24.680 align:start position:0%
the end of October I hope to put some um
 
03:10:27.389 --> 03:10:27.399 align:start position:0%
some real numbers together to ask for
 
03:10:30.870 --> 03:10:30.880 align:start position:0%
and justify and um let's let's leave
 
03:10:33.110 --> 03:10:33.120 align:start position:0%
this better than we we found it um and
 
03:10:34.590 --> 03:10:34.600 align:start position:0%
so we don't have to talk about it
 
03:10:36.950 --> 03:10:36.960 align:start position:0%
anymore um really next year we could
 
03:10:38.830 --> 03:10:38.840 align:start position:0%
just maybe deal with
 
03:10:42.110 --> 03:10:42.120 align:start position:0%
crime homework homework yeah the
 
03:10:43.590 --> 03:10:43.600 align:start position:0%
