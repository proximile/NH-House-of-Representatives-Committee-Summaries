00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
during the committee meetings now keep
 
00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.440 align:start position:0%
in mind that
 
00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:00.800 align:start position:0%
during the committee meetings it's uh
 
00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800 align:start position:0%
this virtual thing is going to be kind
 
00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 align:start position:0%
of tough
 
00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:05.759 align:start position:0%
you know on asking the questions i've
 
00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 align:start position:0%
been on a few meetings like this
 
00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:10.320 align:start position:0%
and it it it's hard especially when
 
00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680 align:start position:0%
you've got veterans
 
00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
that are homeless that call in for a um
 
00:05:15.029 --> 00:05:15.039 align:start position:0%
bill that i
 
00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:17.360 align:start position:0%
sponsored before it was tough on them
 
00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.000 align:start position:0%
they lost the signal they got cut off
 
00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 align:start position:0%

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:24.880 align:start position:0%
heather is right it doesn't look like
 
00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:26.560 align:start position:0%
she's on now okay
 
00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:29.840 align:start position:0%
heather is a long time um committee
 
00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
assistant's been up there for years i
 
00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:32.720 align:start position:0%
think she's the senior

takes care of uh the
 
00:06:41.909 --> 00:06:41.919 align:start position:0%
the committee uh reports that we write
 
00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:43.120 align:start position:0%
on each bill that we
 
00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
uh move forward with or against
 
00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:48.160 align:start position:0%

responsibilities like uh what we're
 
00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
going to be doing for the hybrid
 
00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:29.350 align:start position:0%
going to be doing for the hybrid
committee

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:29.360 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:08:31.749 --> 00:08:31.759 align:start position:0%
if you take a look at what i posted here
 
00:08:33.509 --> 00:08:33.519 align:start position:0%
the the hybrid committees are going to
 
00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:35.120 align:start position:0%
be like i said earlier
 
00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
are going to be zoomed and hopefully we
 
00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
have somebody who's technically
 
00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:40.070 align:start position:0%
have somebody who's technically
proficient

00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
proficient
 
00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:42.560 align:start position:0%
that will be able to assist us in moving
 
00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
forward on putting things up
 
00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
uh you know on the web so other people
 
00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:48.720 align:start position:0%
can see it
 
00:08:52.389 --> 00:08:52.399 align:start position:0%
the um tv screens are being set in the
 
00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:54.880 align:start position:0%
in the rooms the double rooms there'll
 
00:08:56.949 --> 00:08:56.959 align:start position:0%
be plenty of space in between for social
 
00:08:56.959 --> 00:08:58.470 align:start position:0%
be plenty of space in between for social
distancing

00:08:58.470 --> 00:08:58.480 align:start position:0%
distancing
 
00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
there will be a uh what they call
 
00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:05.440 align:start position:0%
air exchanges uh prior to cdc
 
00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:07.350 align:start position:0%
air exchanges uh prior to cdc
requirements

00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:07.360 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
00:09:08.949 --> 00:09:08.959 align:start position:0%
right now they're trying to get three or
 
00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
four times
 
00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:12.880 align:start position:0%
or two more times of what the cdc
 
00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:14.720 align:start position:0%
requires don't ask me about
 
00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:17.360 align:start position:0%
how these air exchanges work in my
 
00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
office here i have an air exchanger but
 
00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:20.160 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:22.880 align:start position:0%
heat pump type takes in air blows out
 
00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:23.509 align:start position:0%
heat pump type takes in air blows out
here

00:09:23.509 --> 00:09:23.519 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
for heat and also uh air conditioning so
 
00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:28.320 align:start position:0%
i imagine that that would be something
 
00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:29.190 align:start position:0%
i imagine that that would be something
similar

00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:29.200 align:start position:0%
similar
 
00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:32.080 align:start position:0%
to what these heat exchangers do or
 
00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:32.389 align:start position:0%
to what these heat exchangers do or
these

00:09:32.389 --> 00:09:32.399 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
air exchanges along with they're going
 
00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:35.440 align:start position:0%
to have uv
 
00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:38.240 align:start position:0%
system put in place there for um our
 
00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:40.000 align:start position:0%
safety at the state house
 
00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:43.600 align:start position:0%
or in the yellow beam so
 
00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:47.200 align:start position:0%
our um assistant uh
 
00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
secretary i will be the one that will be
 
00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:51.680 align:start position:0%
putting name plates in place on the
 
00:09:53.269 --> 00:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
tables and the committee rooms after
 
00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:54.800 align:start position:0%
when you come in
 
00:09:57.269 --> 00:09:57.279 align:start position:0%
i will be setting up once i identify
 
00:09:58.790 --> 00:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
who's going to be sitting where in the
 
00:09:58.800 --> 00:09:59.829 align:start position:0%
who's going to be sitting where in the
committee

00:09:59.829 --> 00:09:59.839 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
i will be identifying somebody who's
 
00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
closest to the door
 
00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:06.560 align:start position:0%
will be a kind of of our emergency
 
00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:08.560 align:start position:0%
response person
 
00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
who if there's something that's going on
 
00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:12.160 align:start position:0%
in the state house or we're having a
 
00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:13.600 align:start position:0%
problem there
 
00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:15.040 align:start position:0%
they will have the number for the
 
00:10:17.829 --> 00:10:17.839 align:start position:0%
security and
 
00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
you know or i will let them know hey we
 
00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:22.160 align:start position:0%
need to call security we have an unruly
 
00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:22.550 align:start position:0%
need to call security we have an unruly
uh

00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:10:24.949 --> 00:10:24.959 align:start position:0%
guest in our uh committee room once we
 
00:10:26.949 --> 00:10:26.959 align:start position:0%
start bringing the public back in
 
00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:29.360 align:start position:0%
so we'll get into that a little bit more
 
00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:31.600 align:start position:0%
as we move forward
 
00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:35.120 align:start position:0%
now if the schedules on the hearings we
 
00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:36.880 align:start position:0%
have nine bills right now as of
 
00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:38.320 align:start position:0%
yesterday at two o'clock
 
00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:41.360 align:start position:0%
the committee two of them are bills that
 
00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:41.910 align:start position:0%
the committee two of them are bills that
are

00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:10:44.949 --> 00:10:44.959 align:start position:0%
uh veterans bills that i believe
 
00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:47.200 align:start position:0%
both of them have already passed before
 
00:10:48.389 --> 00:10:48.399 align:start position:0%
but because of the
 
00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
colvin and they were stuck on senate
 
00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:52.880 align:start position:0%
bills they end up dying
 
00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
so they're pretty simple veterans bills
 
00:10:58.150 --> 00:10:58.160 align:start position:0%
the rest of them uh the seven other
 
00:10:59.430 --> 00:10:59.440 align:start position:0%

00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:01.120 align:start position:0%
resolutions and i'm not going to bring
 
00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:02.720 align:start position:0%

you'll be able to go to the state page
 
00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:07.200 align:start position:0%
you'll be able to click on committees
 
00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:09.760 align:start position:0%
standing committees go down to state and
 
00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:11.680 align:start position:0%

okay because i have like a half hour
 
00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:25.040 align:start position:0%
then we're going to go right into the
 
00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:27.040 align:start position:0%

lsas into the hp status uh once they're
 
00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:41.200 align:start position:0%
entered into the system
 
00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:43.600 align:start position:0%

not a marital asset
 
00:12:02.949 --> 00:12:02.959 align:start position:0%
so that's gonna go to another committee
 
00:12:04.949 --> 00:12:04.959 align:start position:0%

00:12:13.829 --> 00:12:13.839 align:start position:0%

and there's certain bills that i i will
 
00:12:18.949 --> 00:12:18.959 align:start position:0%
request as the chair

that they come to us as a second
 
00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:23.600 align:start position:0%
committee okay so but i have to try to
 
00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:25.200 align:start position:0%
you know keep an eye on those bills that
 
00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:26.800 align:start position:0%
are in other committees
 
00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
now i will be scheduling all the
 
00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:31.190 align:start position:0%
now i will be scheduling all the
hearings

00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:31.200 align:start position:0%

we will have assisted with brad and
 
00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:38.480 align:start position:0%
there's another technical staff
 
00:12:40.069 --> 00:12:40.079 align:start position:0%
that will help us set up on the zoom
 
00:12:41.829 --> 00:12:41.839 align:start position:0%
meetings there to get them in place and
 
00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:42.720 align:start position:0%

calendar
 
00:12:48.949 --> 00:12:48.959 align:start position:0%
so everyone can see it i talked earlier
 
00:12:50.629 --> 00:12:50.639 align:start position:0%
about the blue sheets
 
00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
they're working on that system there to
 
00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
where somebody can just go into our
 
00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:55.200 align:start position:0%
standing committee
 
00:12:58.230 --> 00:12:58.240 align:start position:0%
sign in to support or against or sign in
 
00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:01.200 align:start position:0%
to speak for the committee
 
00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:03.440 align:start position:0%
if you look on the set up that
 
00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:04.310 align:start position:0%
if you look on the set up that
registration

00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
registration
 
00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:06.560 align:start position:0%
page for members of the public like i
 
00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:08.560 align:start position:0%
said that's in development
 
00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:11.600 align:start position:0%
under the committee assistance here you
 
00:13:12.069 --> 00:13:12.079 align:start position:0%
look at
 
00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:15.200 align:start position:0%
on the bill filing um where
 
00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:17.600 align:start position:0%
the committee assistant is the one who
 
00:13:18.629 --> 00:13:18.639 align:start position:0%
will type up
 
00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:21.920 align:start position:0%
our uh committee reports we used to call
 
00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:22.880 align:start position:0%
them blurbs
 
00:13:24.629 --> 00:13:24.639 align:start position:0%
i still call them blurbs but they
 
00:13:26.069 --> 00:13:26.079 align:start position:0%
changed the name for some reason the
 
00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
last term
 
00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
the committee reports so and then she
 
00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:31.600 align:start position:0%
will sign him
 
00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
i'm one chairman who writes after a
 
00:13:36.069 --> 00:13:36.079 align:start position:0%
executive session
 
00:13:38.629 --> 00:13:38.639 align:start position:0%
before close a business to get the uh
 
00:13:38.639 --> 00:13:39.509 align:start position:0%
before close a business to get the uh
report

00:13:39.509 --> 00:13:39.519 align:start position:0%
report
 
00:13:41.509 --> 00:13:41.519 align:start position:0%
whether it be a minority report against
 
00:13:43.829 --> 00:13:43.839 align:start position:0%
a bill or a majority bill
 
00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
for the bill okay to get it in so i can
 
00:13:48.069 --> 00:13:48.079 align:start position:0%
get it filled out
 
00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:50.320 align:start position:0%
uh signed off on it and then get it
 
00:13:52.069 --> 00:13:52.079 align:start position:0%
turned in so we can move on to bigger
 
00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:53.440 align:start position:0%
and better things
 
00:13:55.189 --> 00:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
so keep that in mind there on when
 
00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
you're making the motions
 
00:13:59.910 --> 00:13:59.920 align:start position:0%
to move forward to pass a bill
 
00:14:03.189 --> 00:14:03.199 align:start position:0%
uh you know again itl bill or interim
 
00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
study would ever be
 
00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:07.120 align:start position:0%
i will need to be prepared to have those
 
00:14:08.389 --> 00:14:08.399 align:start position:0%
reports in
 
00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:10.880 align:start position:0%
now linda who is pretty uh massive
 
00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:12.160 align:start position:0%
representative there
 
00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:14.320 align:start position:0%
was pretty sharp on having a game plan
 
00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:16.000 align:start position:0%
when she comes into an executive
 
00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:18.800 align:start position:0%
session and knowing exactly what her
 
00:14:20.389 --> 00:14:20.399 align:start position:0%
committee's doing just like i
 
00:14:23.269 --> 00:14:23.279 align:start position:0%
am as far as on the republicans and
 
00:14:25.189 --> 00:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
making sure that i have blurbs and other
 
00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:26.560 align:start position:0%
stuff ready to roll
 
00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
so that way there we can get our stuff
 
00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:29.600 align:start position:0%
turned in
 
00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:31.600 align:start position:0%
so we can go up to the clerk's office so
 
00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:32.880 align:start position:0%
we can get ready to go
 
00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:36.720 align:start position:0%
onto the calendar then to the floor
 
00:14:42.389 --> 00:14:42.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:45.189 --> 00:14:45.199 align:start position:0%
the committee assistance also uh will
 
00:14:45.199 --> 00:14:46.949 align:start position:0%
the committee assistance also uh will
handle

00:14:46.949 --> 00:14:46.959 align:start position:0%
handle
 
00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:48.880 align:start position:0%
uh pretty much anything like uh that
 
00:14:50.389 --> 00:14:50.399 align:start position:0%
comes in and out of the committee
 
00:14:53.189 --> 00:14:53.199 align:start position:0%
she also is non-partisan the committee
 
00:14:53.199 --> 00:14:53.670 align:start position:0%
she also is non-partisan the committee
clerk

00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:53.680 align:start position:0%
clerk
 
00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:56.240 align:start position:0%
um the committee rather assistant has so
 
00:14:57.750 --> 00:14:57.760 align:start position:0%
many committees i think she's got like
 
00:14:59.189 --> 00:14:59.199 align:start position:0%
three or four committees
 
00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:02.480 align:start position:0%
she's responsible for in her office or
 
00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
in another
 
00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
area there'll be a more likely in her
 
00:15:07.509 --> 00:15:07.519 align:start position:0%
office there'll be a section you can
 
00:15:08.629 --> 00:15:08.639 align:start position:0%
grab the bills
 
00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:10.720 align:start position:0%
copies of the bills when we're there and
 
00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:12.720 align:start position:0%
you will also have them on the table
 
00:15:14.629 --> 00:15:14.639 align:start position:0%
uh a folder that we put out there with
 
00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:16.000 align:start position:0%
the bills
 
00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:17.440 align:start position:0%
she's the one that makes sure that all
 
00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:19.600 align:start position:0%
this is done for you
 
00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:23.360 align:start position:0%
the committee assistant
 
00:15:25.750 --> 00:15:25.760 align:start position:0%
works for us to make it easy she's
 
00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:28.240 align:start position:0%
non-partisan also so keep that in mind
 
00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
she does not get involved
 
00:15:33.430 --> 00:15:33.440 align:start position:0%
in any politics and she's there to
 
00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
assist you and she's been there for
 
00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:36.880 align:start position:0%
years heather and she's a great help to
 
00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:37.110 align:start position:0%
years heather and she's a great help to
us

00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:37.120 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
uh you know she'll make a big difference
 
00:15:41.189 --> 00:15:41.199 align:start position:0%
for our committee
 
00:15:43.269 --> 00:15:43.279 align:start position:0%
now the researcher and he's already
 
00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
talked about him if you look and see
 
00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:47.120 align:start position:0%
where i posted on the researcher
 
00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:50.320 align:start position:0%
you know he takes care you know on uh
 
00:15:51.749 --> 00:15:51.759 align:start position:0%
the whole statuses there for the
 
00:15:51.759 --> 00:15:52.949 align:start position:0%
the whole statuses there for the
committee

00:15:52.949 --> 00:15:52.959 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
uh he makes them sure that we're um
 
00:15:57.749 --> 00:15:57.759 align:start position:0%
you know if there's something we need
 
00:16:00.069 --> 00:16:00.079 align:start position:0%
for the committee he'll be he's on the
 
00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
ball to make sure that we get it there
 
00:16:04.949 --> 00:16:04.959 align:start position:0%
a lot of times any bills that come up
 
00:16:06.629 --> 00:16:06.639 align:start position:0%
into the committee
 
00:16:09.189 --> 00:16:09.199 align:start position:0%
uh that have been heard before i like to
 
00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
have the history
 
00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
of that bill to come forward so we can
 
00:16:14.949 --> 00:16:14.959 align:start position:0%
get a copy to each one of the members
 
00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
so they know what has happened what
 
00:16:18.949 --> 00:16:18.959 align:start position:0%
happened with that bill in the past
 
00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
and what has been done on it whether it
 
00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:22.480 align:start position:0%
passed the field
 
00:16:24.949 --> 00:16:24.959 align:start position:0%
okay so hopefully uh you know we'll be
 
00:16:26.389 --> 00:16:26.399 align:start position:0%
able to get that on
 
00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:27.920 align:start position:0%
on whatever bills that we're in our
 
00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:29.600 align:start position:0%
committee before that are coming back
 
00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:30.230 align:start position:0%
committee before that are coming back
for

00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:30.240 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:16:33.509 --> 00:16:33.519 align:start position:0%
another vote okay and then of course
 
00:16:36.069 --> 00:16:36.079 align:start position:0%
uh we follow up with the clerk you know
 
00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
to get the minutes you know for the file
 
00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:38.230 align:start position:0%
to get the minutes you know for the file
or

00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:38.240 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:41.440 align:start position:0%
in the past let me see here
 
00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:44.320 align:start position:0%
the researcher as i was stating area if
 
00:16:45.509 --> 00:16:45.519 align:start position:0%
i sound a little confused
 
00:16:46.949 --> 00:16:46.959 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to read myself from the
 
00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:48.880 align:start position:0%
computer so i can stay
 
00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:52.000 align:start position:0%
in order the researcher
 
00:16:55.350 --> 00:16:55.360 align:start position:0%
plays a big part in our committee okay
 
00:16:59.590 --> 00:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
um and we will need his assistance here
 
00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:01.600 align:start position:0%
like if there's amendments or stuff that
 
00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
needs to be done
 
00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:04.160 align:start position:0%
we're trying to figure out how we're
 
00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
going to handle this here
 
00:17:08.789 --> 00:17:08.799 align:start position:0%
being virtual okay because uh the
 
00:17:10.870 --> 00:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
legislative services
 
00:17:12.870 --> 00:17:12.880 align:start position:0%
uh they're not in there full-time so i
 
00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:14.160 align:start position:0%
don't know how that's going to work
 
00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:16.480 align:start position:0%
yet when we're in committee hearings
 
00:17:18.789 --> 00:17:18.799 align:start position:0%
especially executive sessions
 
00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:21.280 align:start position:0%
when we need to do an alt amendment to a
 
00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:21.990 align:start position:0%
when we need to do an alt amendment to a
bill

00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:25.760 align:start position:0%
in order to get it passed okay
 
00:17:27.029 --> 00:17:27.039 align:start position:0%
i'm going to move down to the tech
 
00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
support uh staff
 
00:17:31.029 --> 00:17:31.039 align:start position:0%
uh earlier i was trying to get on here
 
00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:33.520 align:start position:0%
at 9 30 and i made a phone call
 
00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:34.640 align:start position:0%
you know because we wanted to get
 
00:17:36.789 --> 00:17:36.799 align:start position:0%
legislators on here prior
 
00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:39.440 align:start position:0%
to uh 10 o'clock cause like i said i'd
 
00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
like to start right on the
 
00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
10 o'clock if i am not in the room at 10
 
00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:45.280 align:start position:0%
o'clock when we're having a public
 
00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:46.150 align:start position:0%
o'clock when we're having a public
hearing

00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:46.160 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
for some reason sometimes the chairman
 
00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:49.200 align:start position:0%
is tied up
 
00:17:50.789 --> 00:17:50.799 align:start position:0%
then the vice chair should open up the
 
00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
meeting okay whether i'm there or not
 
00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:55.600 align:start position:0%
that meeting will start at 10 o'clock in
 
00:17:57.590 --> 00:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
the morning unless you know
 
00:18:00.789 --> 00:18:00.799 align:start position:0%
i am there to postpone it for a few
 
00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
minutes or whatever
 
00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
but like i said our meetings will start
 
00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
um let's go to committee members
 
00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
well before committee members for the
 
00:18:18.549 --> 00:18:18.559 align:start position:0%
republicans uh
 
00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:21.760 align:start position:0%
in the democrats when we do an executive
 
00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:22.310 align:start position:0%
in the democrats when we do an executive
session

00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:22.320 align:start position:0%
session
 
00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:25.440 align:start position:0%
uh we like to caucus what i mean by we
 
00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:27.440 align:start position:0%
caucus here we wanna we have to get
 
00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:28.640 align:start position:0%
together identify
 
00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
a game plan for each one of our parties
 
00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
on the certain pieces of legislation
 
00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
like i said earlier when it comes to
 
00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:37.200 align:start position:0%
veterans most time we're pretty much
 
00:18:39.490 --> 00:18:39.500 align:start position:0%
clear but when it comes to
 
00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:41.029 align:start position:0%
clear but when it comes to
[Music]

00:18:41.029 --> 00:18:41.039 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:44.400 align:start position:0%
resolutions then we have to uh
 
00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:46.640 align:start position:0%
each each party has a game plan on
 
00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:48.640 align:start position:0%
whether they support or don't support
 
00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:52.880 align:start position:0%
so that's why we we caucus prior to a
 
00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:55.360 align:start position:0%
executive session starting so keep that
 
00:18:56.470 --> 00:18:56.480 align:start position:0%
in mind
 
00:18:58.950 --> 00:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
if your hearing starts at 10 o'clock
 
00:18:58.960 --> 00:18:59.830 align:start position:0%
if your hearing starts at 10 o'clock
exact

00:18:59.830 --> 00:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
exact
 
00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:02.080 align:start position:0%
that means you might want to caucus at 9
 
00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:03.110 align:start position:0%
that means you might want to caucus at 9
30

00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
30
 
00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:06.400 align:start position:0%
okay in order to get a game plan okay
 
00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:08.840 align:start position:0%
let me see we're out here
 
00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:11.510 align:start position:0%
let me see we're out here
reading

00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
reading
 
00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:14.320 align:start position:0%
okay if you look at where the chairman
 
00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:15.430 align:start position:0%
okay if you look at where the chairman
responsibilities

00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:15.440 align:start position:0%
responsibilities
 
00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
are there there's a opening script
 
00:19:19.029 --> 00:19:19.039 align:start position:0%
that's at the bottom of this here that
 
00:19:20.789 --> 00:19:20.799 align:start position:0%
i'm required to read
 
00:19:24.549 --> 00:19:24.559 align:start position:0%
okay prior to opening up a um
 
00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:26.160 align:start position:0%
any type of meeting confirming
 
00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:28.240 align:start position:0%
compliance with executive orders
 
00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:31.200 align:start position:0%
with the governor's executive order okay
 
00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
because in 91a it's important that we
 
00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
make demo sure that we have the
 
00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
right information put out there to the
 
00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:38.789 align:start position:0%
right information put out there to the
public

00:19:38.789 --> 00:19:38.799 align:start position:0%
public
 
00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:40.400 align:start position:0%
and exactly we're going to pause to
 
00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:42.880 align:start position:0%
ensure that we all have video on in our
 
00:19:44.549 --> 00:19:44.559 align:start position:0%
in their chairs before calling the
 
00:19:44.559 --> 00:19:45.830 align:start position:0%
in their chairs before calling the
question

00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
the clerk will call a roll call
 
00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:52.960 align:start position:0%
prior okay and you will let her know
 
00:19:55.990 --> 00:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
uh if you're you know if you're
 
00:19:57.669 --> 00:19:57.679 align:start position:0%
i hope to have everyone in the room for
 
00:19:59.510 --> 00:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
executive sessions
 
00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
okay so that's my game plan anyways but
 
00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
if for some ungodly reason
 
00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:07.280 align:start position:0%
we can't uh then
 
00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:09.360 align:start position:0%
we have to change the way we do business
 
00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
here on exec
 
00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
because i prefer face-to-face when it
 
00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
comes to voting
 
00:20:17.190 --> 00:20:17.200 align:start position:0%
okay but most of the time if you're
 
00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:18.080 align:start position:0%
doing a
 
00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:20.480 align:start position:0%
zoom meeting you want to say who you're
 
00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
with uh if there's anyone else in the
 
00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:22.720 align:start position:0%
room uh
 
00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
for public reasons for 91a reasons
 
00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
now brad do we do are the zoo meetings
 
00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:31.840 align:start position:0%
going to be recruited
 
00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
uh yes they will be and they'll be
 
00:20:35.029 --> 00:20:35.039 align:start position:0%
recorded and um
 
00:20:39.029 --> 00:20:39.039 align:start position:0%

00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:48.240 align:start position:0%
these areas um
 
00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:50.640 align:start position:0%

00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:29.360 align:start position:0%
once we get the roll call um her other
 
00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:31.760 align:start position:0%
duties will be to take the minutes
 
00:21:34.549 --> 00:21:34.559 align:start position:0%

uh
 
00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:37.120 align:start position:0%
she'll she will be sent roll call sheets
 
00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
for exec sessions
 
00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:41.360 align:start position:0%
okay that will be given to her but uh
 
00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:41.909 align:start position:0%
okay that will be given to her but uh
more

00:21:41.909 --> 00:21:41.919 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
like i said i plan on holding exec
 
00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:46.400 align:start position:0%
sessions in the committee hearings
 
00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:48.880 align:start position:0%
if for some reason you cannot make an
 
00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:50.320 align:start position:0%
exec session
 
00:21:52.470 --> 00:21:52.480 align:start position:0%
if you're a democrat you need to let the
 
00:21:54.149 --> 00:21:54.159 align:start position:0%
ranking member know
 
00:21:56.390 --> 00:21:56.400 align:start position:0%
so she can work with your team to get
 
00:21:58.230 --> 00:21:58.240 align:start position:0%
you replaced
 
00:21:59.990 --> 00:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
okay and that has to be done the day
 
00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:02.480 align:start position:0%
before the executive session
 
00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
not i'm not sure if they're going to
 
00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
change that policy because of uh what's
 
00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:08.240 align:start position:0%
going on with the covert stuff
 
00:22:11.270 --> 00:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
as far as the republicans very important
 
00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:13.840 align:start position:0%
i need you to get with my vice chair
 
00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:16.480 align:start position:0%
if you cannot make an executive session
 
00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
very important
 
00:22:20.149 --> 00:22:20.159 align:start position:0%
for one reason another you have to let
 
00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
him know
 
00:22:23.590 --> 00:22:23.600 align:start position:0%
and then we will get the message to the
 
00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:25.200 align:start position:0%
republican side
 
00:22:27.029 --> 00:22:27.039 align:start position:0%
so we have a replacement for your
 
00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
executive in the executive session
 
00:22:31.669 --> 00:22:31.679 align:start position:0%
so keep that in mind because i mean for
 
00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:33.280 align:start position:0%
republican democrats
 
00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:36.080 align:start position:0%
it's very important for us to make sure
 
00:22:37.909 --> 00:22:37.919 align:start position:0%
that we have a quorum
 
00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
in order to do business in the committee
 
00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:41.190 align:start position:0%
in order to do business in the committee
hearing

00:22:41.190 --> 00:22:41.200 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
now keep in mind when we have committee
 
00:22:45.669 --> 00:22:45.679 align:start position:0%
hearings we do not use robert rules
 
00:22:49.669 --> 00:22:49.679 align:start position:0%
we use masons okay and
 
00:22:51.909 --> 00:22:51.919 align:start position:0%
that those are the rules that we use in
 
00:22:51.919 --> 00:22:52.950 align:start position:0%
that those are the rules that we use in
committee

00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:52.960 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:55.440 align:start position:0%
so i recommend some of you is to uh
 
00:22:56.470 --> 00:22:56.480 align:start position:0%
educate yourself
 
00:22:59.029 --> 00:22:59.039 align:start position:0%
on masons on the committees on how to
 
00:23:00.789 --> 00:23:00.799 align:start position:0%
perform you know and run a committee
 
00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:02.720 align:start position:0%
and you know and what you can do and
 
00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:04.240 align:start position:0%
what you can't do
 
00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:06.320 align:start position:0%
one of the things i found out throughout
 
00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:07.520 align:start position:0%
the years
 
00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:09.200 align:start position:0%
there's always somebody in there that's
 
00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:11.280 align:start position:0%
always trying to silence the majority of
 
00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:12.320 align:start position:0%
the minority
 
00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:14.960 align:start position:0%
and they try to move the question that
 
00:23:16.789 --> 00:23:16.799 align:start position:0%
is unauthorized you cannot move the
 
00:23:19.510 --> 00:23:19.520 align:start position:0%
question in the committee during debate
 
00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:22.880 align:start position:0%
okay until the last person speaks or
 
00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:25.200 align:start position:0%
if the chairman decides it's repetitious
 
00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:26.310 align:start position:0%
if the chairman decides it's repetitious
then

00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:26.320 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:23:29.029 --> 00:23:29.039 align:start position:0%
he will move for a vote but i'm a
 
00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:30.720 align:start position:0%
freedom of speech guy and i
 
00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:32.480 align:start position:0%
every representative in the committee
 
00:23:34.310 --> 00:23:34.320 align:start position:0%
has the right to speak
 
00:23:36.149 --> 00:23:36.159 align:start position:0%
and we are civil to each and every one
 
00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
of us together
 
00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
because we're in this we're a team and
 
00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:41.360 align:start position:0%
we have to work this together whether we
 
00:23:43.029 --> 00:23:43.039 align:start position:0%
agree or disagree
 
00:23:46.390 --> 00:23:46.400 align:start position:0%
we do it in a civil manner
 
00:23:49.029 --> 00:23:49.039 align:start position:0%
all members okay keep in mind must
 
00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:50.480 align:start position:0%

make sure that the clerk uh knows
 
00:24:00.149 --> 00:24:00.159 align:start position:0%
like for instance i have two emails i
 
00:24:01.830 --> 00:24:01.840 align:start position:0%
had to answer an email and tell them
 
00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:04.320 align:start position:0%
i'll use my legislative email
 
00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:06.720 align:start position:0%
okay so that has to be sent in uh to
 
00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
make sure that they have the right email
 
00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:11.760 align:start position:0%

receipt that they're setting up
 
00:24:25.669 --> 00:24:25.679 align:start position:0%

00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:26.640 align:start position:0%
hopefully uh
 
00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:28.720 align:start position:0%
they'll be set up soon where it's an
 
00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:30.480 align:start position:0%
automatic receipt that you received it
 
00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:32.640 align:start position:0%

00:24:34.789 --> 00:24:34.799 align:start position:0%
members must inform their cheers if they
 
00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:37.200 align:start position:0%

important

00:24:38.070 --> 00:24:38.080 align:start position:0%
important
 
00:24:41.669 --> 00:24:41.679 align:start position:0%
we need to know this if participating by
 
00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:42.640 align:start position:0%
phone provide
 
00:24:45.430 --> 00:24:45.440 align:start position:0%
phone numbers so they can be recognized
 
00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
also when you log in by phone make sure
 
00:24:48.870 --> 00:24:48.880 align:start position:0%

00:24:54.310 --> 00:24:54.320 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:24:56.710 --> 00:24:56.720 align:start position:0%
that's uh keeping an eye on who's
 
00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:57.750 align:start position:0%
that's uh keeping an eye on who's
calling

00:24:57.750 --> 00:24:57.760 align:start position:0%
calling
 
00:25:00.149 --> 00:25:00.159 align:start position:0%
you know in in whether it's the public
 
00:25:00.789 --> 00:25:00.799 align:start position:0%
or not
 
00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:04.480 align:start position:0%
you know instructed not to share
 
00:25:09.029 --> 00:25:09.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:11.269 --> 00:25:11.279 align:start position:0%
well you know i'm going to disregard
 
00:25:13.110 --> 00:25:13.120 align:start position:0%
that because i don't know why
 
00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
like myself i shared the zoom uh
 
00:25:18.549 --> 00:25:18.559 align:start position:0%
with the public and i put it on with
 
00:25:20.230 --> 00:25:20.240 align:start position:0%
other representatives because it wasn't
 
00:25:21.990 --> 00:25:22.000 align:start position:0%
in the calendar
 
00:25:24.549 --> 00:25:24.559 align:start position:0%
normally our resume meetings our
 
00:25:26.549 --> 00:25:26.559 align:start position:0%
committee meetings are in the calendar
 
00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
for some reason this one didn't get in
 
00:25:30.870 --> 00:25:30.880 align:start position:0%
uh but because it was posted
 
00:25:32.310 --> 00:25:32.320 align:start position:0%
it was sent out to each one he is
 
00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:34.640 align:start position:0%
normally they posted on the door
 
00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
um you know 72 hours prior
 
00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:40.480 align:start position:0%
then we're protected so and i did call
 
00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:42.720 align:start position:0%
on why it wasn't in the calendar just to
 
00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:25:46.549 --> 00:25:46.559 align:start position:0%
get an idea on this here so
 
00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
i don't know why that that is there you
 
00:25:50.230 --> 00:25:50.240 align:start position:0%
know i'm not sharing the uh
 
00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:52.880 align:start position:0%
zoom invitation back can you touch on
 
00:25:56.070 --> 00:25:56.080 align:start position:0%
that one
 
00:25:59.190 --> 00:25:59.200 align:start position:0%
mainly for um okay so
 
00:26:03.510 --> 00:26:03.520 align:start position:0%
um each link it's set for having your
 
00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
name on it and we don't want
 
00:26:09.269 --> 00:26:09.279 align:start position:0%
um other we want representatives to
 
00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:10.640 align:start position:0%
share it with members of the public so
 
00:26:11.190 --> 00:26:11.200 align:start position:0%
they are
 
00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
allowed so they come into the as a
 
00:26:16.230 --> 00:26:16.240 align:start position:0%
panelist and not as an attendee
 
00:26:18.390 --> 00:26:18.400 align:start position:0%
okay now like for instance the page of
 
00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:20.480 align:start position:0%
the uh the invite that i receive
 
00:26:23.510 --> 00:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
uh the schedule from heather i cut and
 
00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:23.990 align:start position:0%
uh the schedule from heather i cut and
pasted

00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
pasted
 
00:26:27.510 --> 00:26:27.520 align:start position:0%
that into a uh like a republican page
 
00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:28.720 align:start position:0%
that we have
 
00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
so other republican reps would know and
 
00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:33.200 align:start position:0%
i'm sure linda would want to do the same
 
00:26:35.190 --> 00:26:35.200 align:start position:0%
thing represent
 
00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:38.400 align:start position:0%
uh is that proper uh so the notice that
 
00:26:39.909 --> 00:26:39.919 align:start position:0%
she sent out i believe that had the
 
00:26:41.269 --> 00:26:41.279 align:start position:0%
public link on it
 
00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:43.360 align:start position:0%
and um i believe that that should be
 
00:26:44.470 --> 00:26:44.480 align:start position:0%
that should be fine
 
00:26:46.149 --> 00:26:46.159 align:start position:0%
okay so that's the one that we can share
 
00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
then okay that's what we wanted to clear
 
00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:49.840 align:start position:0%
up then
 
00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:52.000 align:start position:0%
okay uh if it is like i said if
 
00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:53.360 align:start position:0%
participating by phone
 
00:26:55.909 --> 00:26:55.919 align:start position:0%
uh please make sure we recognize that we
 
00:26:59.990 --> 00:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:02.470 --> 00:27:02.480 align:start position:0%
you'll notify the chairman uh you know
 
00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:04.320 align:start position:0%
the vice you'll let me know and then
 
00:27:05.909 --> 00:27:05.919 align:start position:0%
uh the ranking member will let me know
 
00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:08.080 align:start position:0%
and who will not be able to attend
 
00:27:10.149 --> 00:27:10.159 align:start position:0%
if in fact it'll be as a replacement for
 
00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
the system will automatically resend
 
00:27:17.350 --> 00:27:17.360 align:start position:0%
invitations on the morning of the
 
00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:19.029 align:start position:0%
invitations on the morning of the
hearing

00:27:19.029 --> 00:27:19.039 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
00:27:21.669 --> 00:27:21.679 align:start position:0%
okay so you should get another uh
 
00:27:24.230 --> 00:27:24.240 align:start position:0%
invitation but don't count on it
 
00:27:26.470 --> 00:27:26.480 align:start position:0%
uh like myself when the invitations come
 
00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
in for zoom because i have so many
 
00:27:31.990 --> 00:27:32.000 align:start position:0%
this is my second zoom meeting today i
 
00:27:34.149 --> 00:27:34.159 align:start position:0%
put in a certain folder so i know on
 
00:27:35.909 --> 00:27:35.919 align:start position:0%
certain date that i clicked that on
 
00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:38.080 align:start position:0%
for that meeting so keep that in mind
 
00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:39.520 align:start position:0%
this is going to be tough there because
 
00:27:41.590 --> 00:27:41.600 align:start position:0%
if you're like us republicans
 
00:27:43.350 --> 00:27:43.360 align:start position:0%
you know we have caucus zooms we have
 
00:27:44.950 --> 00:27:44.960 align:start position:0%
systems that zoom
 
00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:47.440 align:start position:0%
we're zooming everything so it's uh
 
00:27:47.990 --> 00:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
tough to keep
 
00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
up with there on and plus other uh
 
00:27:54.389 --> 00:27:54.399 align:start position:0%
you know meetings that we do so but
 
00:27:57.430 --> 00:27:57.440 align:start position:0%
this is your priority is our hearings
 
00:28:00.549 --> 00:28:00.559 align:start position:0%
in our executive sessions
 
00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
now if we end up with nine bills i can
 
00:28:05.830 --> 00:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
tell you right now nine bills to me
 
00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:07.840 align:start position:0%
that's probably two days of um
 
00:28:11.430 --> 00:28:11.440 align:start position:0%
hearings and maybe two days of executive
 
00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:12.389 align:start position:0%
hearings and maybe two days of executive
sessions

00:28:12.389 --> 00:28:12.399 align:start position:0%
sessions
 
00:28:15.510 --> 00:28:15.520 align:start position:0%
now the chair reserves the right to hold
 
00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:18.480 align:start position:0%
an executive session
 
00:28:21.110 --> 00:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
um after a bill is heard that's going to
 
00:28:24.149 --> 00:28:24.159 align:start position:0%
be put on the calendar every time
 
00:28:27.430 --> 00:28:27.440 align:start position:0%
okay so um keep that in mind
 
00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:30.480 align:start position:0%
during the um the hearings we want to
 
00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:32.640 align:start position:0%
make sure you decorum you're properly
 
00:28:34.710 --> 00:28:34.720 align:start position:0%
dressed when you come into the hearing
 
00:28:37.269 --> 00:28:37.279 align:start position:0%
um you usually raise the hand features
 
00:28:39.190 --> 00:28:39.200 align:start position:0%
do not speak unless recognized
 
00:28:40.549 --> 00:28:40.559 align:start position:0%
i'm going through quick because i got
 
00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:42.480 align:start position:0%
about one minute to go here before
 
00:28:44.789 --> 00:28:44.799 align:start position:0%
our first speaker you're going to notify
 
00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:46.320 align:start position:0%
the chairman if i'm able
 
00:28:49.669 --> 00:28:49.679 align:start position:0%
uh to attend where am i at here
 
00:28:49.679 --> 00:28:54.389 align:start position:0%
uh to attend where am i at here
um

00:28:54.389 --> 00:28:54.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:56.950 --> 00:28:56.960 align:start position:0%
okay you're gonna mute and unmute
 
00:28:59.350 --> 00:28:59.360 align:start position:0%
themselves because that return zoom
 
00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
meeting is very important to stay muted
 
00:29:03.510 --> 00:29:03.520 align:start position:0%
and then if you want to speak you just
 
00:29:05.909 --> 00:29:05.919 align:start position:0%
click it real quick and then you know
 
00:29:07.669 --> 00:29:07.679 align:start position:0%
or there's a hand system here and i
 
00:29:09.269 --> 00:29:09.279 align:start position:0%
haven't figured out how i'm going to
 
00:29:11.190 --> 00:29:11.200 align:start position:0%
handle that yet on raising the hand to
 
00:29:13.029 --> 00:29:13.039 align:start position:0%
speak i have to
 
00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:15.760 align:start position:0%
there's a uh have video on when they are
 
00:29:18.149 --> 00:29:18.159 align:start position:0%
in the meetings turn off when away from
 
00:29:19.350 --> 00:29:19.360 align:start position:0%

00:36:59.829 --> 00:36:59.839 align:start position:0%
which is what we are here uh and you
 
00:37:01.589 --> 00:37:01.599 align:start position:0%
know dr richard stone
 
00:37:04.150 --> 00:37:04.160 align:start position:0%
the executive in charge of vha is the
 
00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
one who
 
00:37:08.550 --> 00:37:08.560 align:start position:0%
has uh oversight and responsibility for
 
00:37:10.870 --> 00:37:10.880 align:start position:0%
you know the 150 plus medical centers
 
00:37:12.150 --> 00:37:12.160 align:start position:0%
throughout the country
 
00:37:14.069 --> 00:37:14.079 align:start position:0%
and all the policies and the delivery of
 
00:37:15.910 --> 00:37:15.920 align:start position:0%
health care to veterans
 
00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
second up just understanding we have the
 
00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:19.680 align:start position:0%
veterans benefits administration
 
00:37:21.589 --> 00:37:21.599 align:start position:0%
i ended up by dr paul lawrence who's the
 
00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
under secretary for benefits
 
00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:26.560 align:start position:0%
and that takes care of all the uh you
 
00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
know the veteran benefits whether it be
 
00:37:31.750 --> 00:37:31.760 align:start position:0%
the home loans uh education benefits
 
00:37:34.310 --> 00:37:34.320 align:start position:0%
everything to do with everything that
 
00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:35.270 align:start position:0%
everything to do with everything that
veterans

00:37:35.270 --> 00:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
veterans
 
00:37:37.589 --> 00:37:37.599 align:start position:0%
uh are entitled to from a from a benefit
 
00:37:37.599 --> 00:37:38.550 align:start position:0%
uh are entitled to from a from a benefit
standpoint

00:37:38.550 --> 00:37:38.560 align:start position:0%
standpoint
 
00:37:40.870 --> 00:37:40.880 align:start position:0%
and then thirdly is uh the arm is the
 
00:37:42.950 --> 00:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
national cemetery administration
 
00:37:45.589 --> 00:37:45.599 align:start position:0%
headed up by mr randy reeves who's the
 
00:37:46.790 --> 00:37:46.800 align:start position:0%
under secretary for
 
00:37:49.270 --> 00:37:49.280 align:start position:0%
for memorial affairs i bring this up
 
00:37:49.990 --> 00:37:50.000 align:start position:0%
just to understand
 
00:37:52.550 --> 00:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
that we really look at ourselves as one
 
00:37:54.150 --> 00:37:54.160 align:start position:0%
organization here
 
00:37:57.270 --> 00:37:57.280 align:start position:0%
and you know veterans don't uh i think
 
00:37:58.870 --> 00:37:58.880 align:start position:0%
really kind of discriminate between the
 
00:38:00.390 --> 00:38:00.400 align:start position:0%
three of us you know they can come into
 
00:38:01.510 --> 00:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
the medical center
 
00:38:04.710 --> 00:38:04.720 align:start position:0%
at any time and have questions about
 
00:38:07.670 --> 00:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
their benefits or about cemetery uh
 
00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:08.470 align:start position:0%
their benefits or about cemetery uh
benefits

00:38:08.470 --> 00:38:08.480 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
00:38:10.790 --> 00:38:10.800 align:start position:0%
and we do our best you know where we're
 
00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:12.400 align:start position:0%
networked with vba
 
00:38:14.950 --> 00:38:14.960 align:start position:0%
here in the state to be able to kind of
 
00:38:16.870 --> 00:38:16.880 align:start position:0%
serve as a one-stop shop
 
00:38:18.870 --> 00:38:18.880 align:start position:0%
or at least get them to the right folks
 
00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:20.069 align:start position:0%
or at least get them to the right folks
um

00:38:20.069 --> 00:38:20.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:22.069 --> 00:38:22.079 align:start position:0%
to be able to answer their questions and
 
00:38:23.270 --> 00:38:23.280 align:start position:0%
serve them uh
 
00:38:25.910 --> 00:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
so you know generally you know we we
 
00:38:27.670 --> 00:38:27.680 align:start position:0%
don't like to think of ourselves as
 
00:38:30.470 --> 00:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
just handling the healthcare arm of the
 
00:38:32.390 --> 00:38:32.400 align:start position:0%
va here we want to be inclusive to all
 
00:38:34.710 --> 00:38:34.720 align:start position:0%
veterans for all their needs
 
00:38:37.030 --> 00:38:37.040 align:start position:0%
just a little bit about eligibility as
 
00:38:38.870 --> 00:38:38.880 align:start position:0%
this comes up is understanding
 
00:38:40.950 --> 00:38:40.960 align:start position:0%
you know veterans not all veterans are
 
00:38:43.109 --> 00:38:43.119 align:start position:0%
eligible for for health care
 
00:38:45.109 --> 00:38:45.119 align:start position:0%
um what we do when we get out of the
 
00:38:47.109 --> 00:38:47.119 align:start position:0%
service is you know you're evaluated for
 
00:38:49.270 --> 00:38:49.280 align:start position:0%
service connected conditions and you're
 
00:38:51.829 --> 00:38:51.839 align:start position:0%
a that's done through the vba the
 
00:38:53.589 --> 00:38:53.599 align:start position:0%
benefits administration
 
00:38:56.230 --> 00:38:56.240 align:start position:0%
and there's you're assigned a percentage
 
00:38:58.310 --> 00:38:58.320 align:start position:0%
uh of disability and that determines
 
00:39:00.950 --> 00:39:00.960 align:start position:0%
what health care benefits you are
 
00:39:03.349 --> 00:39:03.359 align:start position:0%
entitled to so we all go through this
 
00:39:03.359 --> 00:39:04.470 align:start position:0%
entitled to so we all go through this
eligibility

00:39:04.470 --> 00:39:04.480 align:start position:0%
eligibility
 
00:39:07.030 --> 00:39:07.040 align:start position:0%
uh process as we get out of the service
 
00:39:08.550 --> 00:39:08.560 align:start position:0%
and that's really what drives
 
00:39:11.990 --> 00:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
you know our uh our veteran population
 
00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire and who we take
 
00:39:15.030 --> 00:39:15.040 align:start position:0%
care of
 
00:39:19.589 --> 00:39:19.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:22.069 --> 00:39:22.079 align:start position:0%
you know generally every person who
 
00:39:23.670 --> 00:39:23.680 align:start position:0%
served in the active military and is
 
00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:24.470 align:start position:0%
served in the active military and is
separated

00:39:24.470 --> 00:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
separated
 
00:39:26.470 --> 00:39:26.480 align:start position:0%
um you know is eligible for certain
 
00:39:27.990 --> 00:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
benefits and even in certain
 
00:39:31.030 --> 00:39:31.040 align:start position:0%
conditions and other than uh
 
00:39:33.030 --> 00:39:33.040 align:start position:0%
other than dishonorable there's certain
 
00:39:34.470 --> 00:39:34.480 align:start position:0%
benefits that apply
 
00:39:36.310 --> 00:39:36.320 align:start position:0%
uh you know like certain mental health
 
00:39:37.829 --> 00:39:37.839 align:start position:0%
benefits and we just want to make sure
 
00:39:39.670 --> 00:39:39.680 align:start position:0%
that we're here to take care of those
 
00:39:41.030 --> 00:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
veterans in need
 
00:39:42.710 --> 00:39:42.720 align:start position:0%
and then certainly the last piece we
 
00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:44.480 align:start position:0%
look at is you know current former
 
00:39:46.390 --> 00:39:46.400 align:start position:0%
members of the reserve national guards
 
00:39:46.950 --> 00:39:46.960 align:start position:0%
who are called
 
00:39:49.670 --> 00:39:49.680 align:start position:0%
active duty and deployed and you know
 
00:39:51.589 --> 00:39:51.599 align:start position:0%
since the beginning of uh
 
00:39:53.270 --> 00:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
you know operation iraqi freedom
 
00:39:55.270 --> 00:39:55.280 align:start position:0%
enduring freedom you know as
 
00:39:58.790 --> 00:39:58.800 align:start position:0%
as uh reserves and guardsmen return um
 
00:40:01.270 --> 00:40:01.280 align:start position:0%
stateside here you know we provide that
 
00:40:03.109 --> 00:40:03.119 align:start position:0%
care there's certain eligibility to
 
00:40:03.910 --> 00:40:03.920 align:start position:0%
provide that
 
00:40:07.030 --> 00:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
out um you know for for up to five years
 
00:40:09.829 --> 00:40:09.839 align:start position:0%
in certain uh cases so that's really who
 
00:40:11.510 --> 00:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
we take care of and how that's
 
00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:12.950 align:start position:0%
we take care of and how that's
determined

00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
determined
 
00:40:14.470 --> 00:40:14.480 align:start position:0%
just to know how we're arrayed
 
00:40:16.150 --> 00:40:16.160 align:start position:0%
throughout the state here
 
00:40:19.270 --> 00:40:19.280 align:start position:0%
um these are our locations i'll tell you
 
00:40:20.309 --> 00:40:20.319 align:start position:0%
there's you know about a hundred
 
00:40:22.309 --> 00:40:22.319 align:start position:0%
thousand veterans in new hampshire here
 
00:40:24.950 --> 00:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
of which we have about 25 000 enrolled
 
00:40:26.710 --> 00:40:26.720 align:start position:0%
to the manchester va
 
00:40:29.670 --> 00:40:29.680 align:start position:0%
there's another 10 000 or so enrolled to
 
00:40:31.750 --> 00:40:31.760 align:start position:0%
uh the white river junction va
 
00:40:33.430 --> 00:40:33.440 align:start position:0%
and that's predominantly those veterans
 
00:40:35.190 --> 00:40:35.200 align:start position:0%
that live up in the uh
 
00:40:37.030 --> 00:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
you know the hanover lebanon area up
 
00:40:38.790 --> 00:40:38.800 align:start position:0%
there where the white river junction va
 
00:40:40.470 --> 00:40:40.480 align:start position:0%
is closer but we have a very close
 
00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:41.589 align:start position:0%
is closer but we have a very close
relationship

00:40:41.589 --> 00:40:41.599 align:start position:0%
relationship
 
00:40:43.270 --> 00:40:43.280 align:start position:0%
with the uh with the white river
 
00:40:44.630 --> 00:40:44.640 align:start position:0%
junction va
 
00:40:46.790 --> 00:40:46.800 align:start position:0%
and uh and sharing services and taking
 
00:40:47.990 --> 00:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
care of veterans
 
00:40:49.750 --> 00:40:49.760 align:start position:0%
you can see just you know with the gap
 
00:40:51.990 --> 00:40:52.000 align:start position:0%
there of like 35 000 veterans
 
00:40:53.750 --> 00:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
enrolled and a hundred thousand veterans
 
00:40:55.910 --> 00:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire we have outreach
 
00:40:58.069 --> 00:40:58.079 align:start position:0%
programs where we continually go out
 
00:40:59.670 --> 00:40:59.680 align:start position:0%
and look for those other veterans who
 
00:41:01.349 --> 00:41:01.359 align:start position:0%
may not be aware that they're eligible
 
00:41:02.470 --> 00:41:02.480 align:start position:0%
for services
 
00:41:03.990 --> 00:41:04.000 align:start position:0%
and we spend a lot of time trying to
 
00:41:06.390 --> 00:41:06.400 align:start position:0%
bring them in and giving that they're
 
00:41:08.069 --> 00:41:08.079 align:start position:0%
giving them the option of letting them
 
00:41:09.589 --> 00:41:09.599 align:start position:0%
know that we are here
 
00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
uh to provide those services you know
 
00:41:13.270 --> 00:41:13.280 align:start position:0%
they earned you know they earned that
 
00:41:14.790 --> 00:41:14.800 align:start position:0%
that health care and those benefits and
 
00:41:16.470 --> 00:41:16.480 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure that that they're
 
00:41:18.150 --> 00:41:18.160 align:start position:0%
aware of them
 
00:41:20.630 --> 00:41:20.640 align:start position:0%
just our locations throughout the state
 
00:41:21.910 --> 00:41:21.920 align:start position:0%
you'll see you know certainly the main
 
00:41:24.470 --> 00:41:24.480 align:start position:0%
medical center and manchester va
 
00:41:26.950 --> 00:41:26.960 align:start position:0%
and then we have four what are uh
 
00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:27.990 align:start position:0%
and then we have four what are uh
community-based

00:41:27.990 --> 00:41:28.000 align:start position:0%
community-based
 
00:41:29.990 --> 00:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
outpatient clinics may hear these
 
00:41:31.990 --> 00:41:32.000 align:start position:0%
referred to as cbox
 
00:41:35.190 --> 00:41:35.200 align:start position:0%
uh we've got two over in the uh seacoast
 
00:41:37.510 --> 00:41:37.520 align:start position:0%
area in portsmouth and somersworth
 
00:41:39.510 --> 00:41:39.520 align:start position:0%
and then we've got two up north one in
 
00:41:40.550 --> 00:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
in tilton
 
00:41:42.309 --> 00:41:42.319 align:start position:0%
and then another up in conway in the
 
00:41:44.069 --> 00:41:44.079 align:start position:0%
mount washington valley
 
00:41:47.349 --> 00:41:47.359 align:start position:0%
uh we also have
 
00:41:49.190 --> 00:41:49.200 align:start position:0%
lease space down to the brady sullivan
 
00:41:51.430 --> 00:41:51.440 align:start position:0%
tower in downtown manchester here
 
00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
where we've got some of the support
 
00:41:55.510 --> 00:41:55.520 align:start position:0%
elements for manchester um
 
00:41:57.349 --> 00:41:57.359 align:start position:0%
and the non-clinical elements but we
 
00:41:59.430 --> 00:41:59.440 align:start position:0%
also offer our whole health program to
 
00:42:01.030 --> 00:42:01.040 align:start position:0%
veterans down there so
 
00:42:03.750 --> 00:42:03.760 align:start position:0%
these are the locations where we provide
 
00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:05.109 align:start position:0%
these are the locations where we provide
services

00:42:05.109 --> 00:42:05.119 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:42:07.510 --> 00:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
just to give you an idea of what we
 
00:42:08.630 --> 00:42:08.640 align:start position:0%
provide here
 
00:42:11.990 --> 00:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
i've got a a summarized list here but
 
00:42:13.990 --> 00:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
certainly primary care
 
00:42:16.150 --> 00:42:16.160 align:start position:0%
is big and our home-based primary care
 
00:42:18.550 --> 00:42:18.560 align:start position:0%
where our staff goes out to homebound
 
00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
veterans to make sure that they get the
 
00:42:21.430 --> 00:42:21.440 align:start position:0%
care that they need
 
00:42:24.390 --> 00:42:24.400 align:start position:0%
we have an urgent care facility here and
 
00:42:26.470 --> 00:42:26.480 align:start position:0%
a strong

off opioids
 
00:43:39.270 --> 00:43:39.280 align:start position:0%
uh and a lot of of uh partnership
 
00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
between the pain management
 
00:43:42.870 --> 00:43:42.880 align:start position:0%
pain management and mental health care
 
00:43:44.589 --> 00:43:44.599 align:start position:0%

audiology speech therapy geriatric care
 
00:43:56.550 --> 00:43:56.560 align:start position:0%
we have a community living center which
 
00:43:58.069 --> 00:43:58.079 align:start position:0%
is long-term care facility
 
00:43:59.910 --> 00:43:59.920 align:start position:0%
in the manchester va so we currently
 
00:44:01.349 --> 00:44:01.359 align:start position:0%
have 41 beds
 
00:44:03.510 --> 00:44:03.520 align:start position:0%
where we serve veterans both who need
 
00:44:05.430 --> 00:44:05.440 align:start position:0%
rehab coming out of a hospital
 
00:44:07.510 --> 00:44:07.520 align:start position:0%

nursing home care
 
00:44:10.950 --> 00:44:10.960 align:start position:0%
you know and also i'll just finish up
 
00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
with social work and prosthetics and
 
00:44:14.710 --> 00:44:14.720 align:start position:0%
then certainly our ancillary services
 
00:44:16.230 --> 00:44:16.240 align:start position:0%
which serve veterans
 
00:44:19.270 --> 00:44:19.280 align:start position:0%
needing uh clinical services uh here
 
00:44:21.349 --> 00:44:21.359 align:start position:0%
at the medical center i will say that
 
00:44:23.510 --> 00:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
what is not on here is dental services
 
00:44:25.670 --> 00:44:25.680 align:start position:0%
this is always a big one with veterans
 
00:44:28.150 --> 00:44:28.160 align:start position:0%
um we've had to close our dental clinic
 
00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
with um
 
00:44:30.710 --> 00:44:30.720 align:start position:0%
with covid and we're looking at trying
 
00:44:32.550 --> 00:44:32.560 align:start position:0%
to get that opened back up but we've got
 
00:44:35.270 --> 00:44:35.280 align:start position:0%
some facility
 
00:44:36.790 --> 00:44:36.800 align:start position:0%
construction to do to make that
 
00:44:39.030 --> 00:44:39.040 align:start position:0%
compliant in a coveted environment
 
00:44:41.430 --> 00:44:41.440 align:start position:0%
but just knowing for you that you know
 
00:44:43.670 --> 00:44:43.680 align:start position:0%
there's very strict eligibility criteria
 
00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:43.990 align:start position:0%
there's very strict eligibility criteria
for

00:44:43.990 --> 00:44:44.000 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:44:47.349 --> 00:44:47.359 align:start position:0%
dental um for dental
 
00:44:50.710 --> 00:44:50.720 align:start position:0%
uh being a hundred percent um service
 
00:44:52.069 --> 00:44:52.079 align:start position:0%
connected disability and
 
00:44:54.470 --> 00:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
and that that's that comes up a lot with
 
00:44:56.550 --> 00:44:56.560 align:start position:0%
uh with veterans and different groups of
 
00:44:59.750 --> 00:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
wanting to expand dental services
 
00:45:03.270 --> 00:45:03.280 align:start position:0%
all right just to know um al if you can
 
00:45:05.190 --> 00:45:05.200 align:start position:0%
send out the the slides here
 
00:45:07.510 --> 00:45:07.520 align:start position:0%
um this shows kind of what we offer at
 
00:45:09.270 --> 00:45:09.280 align:start position:0%
this c box but in the interest of time
 
00:45:10.950 --> 00:45:10.960 align:start position:0%
here i'll i'll go through this real
 
00:45:12.069 --> 00:45:12.079 align:start position:0%
quick and
 
00:45:15.349 --> 00:45:15.359 align:start position:0%
and uh um see box generally it's primary
 
00:45:16.870 --> 00:45:16.880 align:start position:0%
care mental health and we do a lot of
 
00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:17.589 align:start position:0%
care mental health and we do a lot of
telehealth

00:45:17.589 --> 00:45:17.599 align:start position:0%
telehealth
 
00:45:19.349 --> 00:45:19.359 align:start position:0%
so that veterans don't have to drive all
 
00:45:21.190 --> 00:45:21.200 align:start position:0%
the way to manchester
 
00:45:23.750 --> 00:45:23.760 align:start position:0%
you can see our expansion updates we've
 
00:45:24.950 --> 00:45:24.960 align:start position:0%
got a lot going on
 
00:45:26.950 --> 00:45:26.960 align:start position:0%
with uh expanding for services here
 
00:45:28.630 --> 00:45:28.640 align:start position:0%
we've got a new building out front which
 
00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:29.190 align:start position:0%
we've got a new building out front which
will

00:45:29.190 --> 00:45:29.200 align:start position:0%
will
 
00:45:31.670 --> 00:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
be completed in the summer of of this
 
00:45:33.510 --> 00:45:33.520 align:start position:0%
year and then opening up a new urgent
 
00:45:35.190 --> 00:45:35.200 align:start position:0%
care and mental health
 
00:45:38.790 --> 00:45:38.800 align:start position:0%
facility uh as well as a new women's
 
00:45:40.630 --> 00:45:40.640 align:start position:0%
health clinic which will break ground
 
00:45:40.640 --> 00:45:41.670 align:start position:0%
health clinic which will break ground
here

00:45:41.670 --> 00:45:41.680 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:45:43.670 --> 00:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of compliance factors we
 
00:45:45.109 --> 00:45:45.119 align:start position:0%
look at to make care
 
00:45:47.430 --> 00:45:47.440 align:start position:0%
safe and accommodating for women
 
00:45:48.950 --> 00:45:48.960 align:start position:0%
veterans you know you've got to think we
 
00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:49.430 align:start position:0%
veterans you know you've got to think we
have

00:45:49.430 --> 00:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:45:50.790 --> 00:45:50.800 align:start position:0%
women veterans that come in that have
 
00:45:53.349 --> 00:45:53.359 align:start position:0%
been subjected to military sexual trauma
 
00:45:55.030 --> 00:45:55.040 align:start position:0%
and things like that and we want a safe
 
00:45:57.270 --> 00:45:57.280 align:start position:0%
environment where they feel comfortable
 
00:45:59.270 --> 00:45:59.280 align:start position:0%
coming in for their care and then just
 
00:46:01.430 --> 00:46:01.440 align:start position:0%
some other construction projects
 
00:46:04.150 --> 00:46:04.160 align:start position:0%
coming down the pike here and another
 
00:46:05.030 --> 00:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
year here
 
00:46:06.710 --> 00:46:06.720 align:start position:0%
to help with our to help with our
 
00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:09.270 align:start position:0%
to help with our to help with our
infrastructure

00:46:09.270 --> 00:46:09.280 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
00:46:10.790 --> 00:46:10.800 align:start position:0%
let's hear from an urgent care
 
00:46:12.230 --> 00:46:12.240 align:start position:0%
standpoint just important to know we
 
00:46:14.069 --> 00:46:14.079 align:start position:0%
have an urgent care that's open seven
 
00:46:15.750 --> 00:46:15.760 align:start position:0%
days a week here from eight to four
 
00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:16.470 align:start position:0%
days a week here from eight to four
thirty

00:46:16.470 --> 00:46:16.480 align:start position:0%
thirty
 
00:46:19.190 --> 00:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
uh the only days it's closed is uh our
 
00:46:20.550 --> 00:46:20.560 align:start position:0%
federal holidays
 
00:46:23.030 --> 00:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
um but this you know mirrored up with
 
00:46:25.030 --> 00:46:25.040 align:start position:0%
the mission act and veterans having the
 
00:46:27.030 --> 00:46:27.040 align:start position:0%
ability to go out on the community to
 
00:46:30.069 --> 00:46:30.079 align:start position:0%
like a clear choice or convenient md
 
00:46:32.630 --> 00:46:32.640 align:start position:0%
uh really gives veterans often uh
 
00:46:34.790 --> 00:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
veterans options of urgent care both
 
00:46:37.670 --> 00:46:37.680 align:start position:0%
at the medical center here as well as in
 
00:46:38.950 --> 00:46:38.960 align:start position:0%
the in the network
 
00:46:41.030 --> 00:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
then we always uh just make sure that
 
00:46:43.430 --> 00:46:43.440 align:start position:0%
they know you know if it is an emergency
 
00:46:44.950 --> 00:46:44.960 align:start position:0%
that they are covered in new hampshire
 
00:46:46.710 --> 00:46:46.720 align:start position:0%
and they need to go to an emergency room
 
00:46:48.390 --> 00:46:48.400 align:start position:0%
and not one of the urgent care so they
 
00:46:49.990 --> 00:46:50.000 align:start position:0%
get the right level of care that they
 
00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:50.790 align:start position:0%
get the right level of care that they
need

00:46:50.790 --> 00:46:50.800 align:start position:0%
need
 
00:46:52.790 --> 00:46:52.800 align:start position:0%
um and then we make sure that those are
 
00:46:53.990 --> 00:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
bills are paid
 
00:46:55.910 --> 00:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
uh making sure that the notifications
 
00:46:57.430 --> 00:46:57.440 align:start position:0%
are done after an ed
 
00:47:00.069 --> 00:47:00.079 align:start position:0%
visit just a little bit here about the
 
00:47:02.230 --> 00:47:02.240 align:start position:0%
women veteran and sexual gender minority
 
00:47:03.190 --> 00:47:03.200 align:start position:0%
health services
 
00:47:05.670 --> 00:47:05.680 align:start position:0%
programs you know i had mentioned us
 
00:47:07.589 --> 00:47:07.599 align:start position:0%
doing the special women's veteran clinic
 
00:47:09.030 --> 00:47:09.040 align:start position:0%
that we're breaking ground on
 
00:47:12.390 --> 00:47:12.400 align:start position:0%
but you know we focus on women's health
 
00:47:14.069 --> 00:47:14.079 align:start position:0%
primary care and mental health
 
00:47:16.550 --> 00:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
all within the scope of this women
 
00:47:18.230 --> 00:47:18.240 align:start position:0%
veteran program clinic
 
00:47:21.510 --> 00:47:21.520 align:start position:0%
and then we offer an lgbt service clinic
 
00:47:23.510 --> 00:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
for those veterans
 
00:47:26.230 --> 00:47:26.240 align:start position:0%
possibly in transition or identifying
 
00:47:28.069 --> 00:47:28.079 align:start position:0%
themselves as lgbt
 
00:47:29.990 --> 00:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
so we give them a safe place to receive
 
00:47:31.990 --> 00:47:32.000 align:start position:0%
that that care and just knowing that you
 
00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:32.309 align:start position:0%
that that care and just knowing that you
know

00:47:32.309 --> 00:47:32.319 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:47:35.030 --> 00:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
everybody every veteran is welcome at
 
00:47:38.230 --> 00:47:38.240 align:start position:0%
the manchester va for their care
 
00:47:40.069 --> 00:47:40.079 align:start position:0%
just note that we can't do it alone and
 
00:47:42.390 --> 00:47:42.400 align:start position:0%
we are reliant on care in the community
 
00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:42.710 align:start position:0%
we are reliant on care in the community
and

00:47:42.710 --> 00:47:42.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:47:45.030 --> 00:47:45.040 align:start position:0%
and so we are not a full service
 
00:47:46.549 --> 00:47:46.559 align:start position:0%
hospital so we have
 
00:47:48.630 --> 00:47:48.640 align:start position:0%
uh you know partnerships both with the
 
00:47:50.549 --> 00:47:50.559 align:start position:0%
other va's in
 
00:47:53.190 --> 00:47:53.200 align:start position:0%
in new england here as well as using our
 
00:47:55.109 --> 00:47:55.119 align:start position:0%
local providers out here and veterans
 
00:47:56.549 --> 00:47:56.559 align:start position:0%
move back and forth between these
 
00:47:58.870 --> 00:47:58.880 align:start position:0%
systems to get the care that they need
 
00:48:01.270 --> 00:48:01.280 align:start position:0%
um this has been you know a big learning
 
00:48:03.270 --> 00:48:03.280 align:start position:0%
curve over the last few years with the
 
00:48:04.870 --> 00:48:04.880 align:start position:0%
initiation of the choice act and then
 
00:48:06.790 --> 00:48:06.800 align:start position:0%
the mission act but we do a pretty good
 
00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:07.430 align:start position:0%
the mission act but we do a pretty good
job

00:48:07.430 --> 00:48:07.440 align:start position:0%
job
 
00:48:09.270 --> 00:48:09.280 align:start position:0%
of getting folks out there for the care
 
00:48:12.069 --> 00:48:12.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:13.750 --> 00:48:13.760 align:start position:0%
just note that we also have like a
 
00:48:15.990 --> 00:48:16.000 align:start position:0%
homeless veteran program where we
 
00:48:17.670 --> 00:48:17.680 align:start position:0%
have a lot of partnership community
 
00:48:19.430 --> 00:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
partners that we work with
 
00:48:21.109 --> 00:48:21.119 align:start position:0%
all looking to make sure that every
 
00:48:22.870 --> 00:48:22.880 align:start position:0%
veteran has a place to live
 
00:48:24.630 --> 00:48:24.640 align:start position:0%
and we take care of their homeless needs
 
00:48:26.870 --> 00:48:26.880 align:start position:0%
so there's some some context here for
 
00:48:27.589 --> 00:48:27.599 align:start position:0%
you but
 
00:48:29.430 --> 00:48:29.440 align:start position:0%
you know we also have a primary care
 
00:48:31.030 --> 00:48:31.040 align:start position:0%
team that provides care
 
00:48:34.230 --> 00:48:34.240 align:start position:0%
to homeless just veterans let you know
 
00:48:34.870 --> 00:48:34.880 align:start position:0%
the last
 
00:48:36.710 --> 00:48:36.720 align:start position:0%
thing i've got here is just some of our
 
00:48:38.390 --> 00:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
big challenges now we continue to look
 
00:48:39.670 --> 00:48:39.680 align:start position:0%
at reimbursement
 
00:48:41.670 --> 00:48:41.680 align:start position:0%
making sure that the hospitals out there
 
00:48:43.190 --> 00:48:43.200 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire are paid
 
00:48:44.790 --> 00:48:44.800 align:start position:0%
for the care that we provide and we've
 
00:48:46.870 --> 00:48:46.880 align:start position:0%
alert worked a lot with the legislature
 
00:48:47.430 --> 00:48:47.440 align:start position:0%
with that
 
00:48:50.230 --> 00:48:50.240 align:start position:0%
to make sure that as we've gone so fast
 
00:48:51.270 --> 00:48:51.280 align:start position:0%
with these different
 
00:48:53.589 --> 00:48:53.599 align:start position:0%
uh programs with care in the community
 
00:48:54.790 --> 00:48:54.800 align:start position:0%
that we need to make sure that people
 
00:48:55.430 --> 00:48:55.440 align:start position:0%
are paid
 
00:48:57.430 --> 00:48:57.440 align:start position:0%
and so we've worked a lot with that and
 
00:48:59.349 --> 00:48:59.359 align:start position:0%
just know that you know right now
 
00:49:01.670 --> 00:49:01.680 align:start position:0%
i mean all of our efforts as well as
 
00:49:03.270 --> 00:49:03.280 align:start position:0%
every other healthcare organization has
 
00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:03.750 align:start position:0%
every other healthcare organization has
been

00:49:03.750 --> 00:49:03.760 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:49:06.309 --> 00:49:06.319 align:start position:0%
covet operations taking care of patients
 
00:49:07.910 --> 00:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
while being able to balance that of
 
00:49:09.430 --> 00:49:09.440 align:start position:0%
taking care of their other health care
 
00:49:09.440 --> 00:49:10.069 align:start position:0%
taking care of their other health care
needs

00:49:10.069 --> 00:49:10.079 align:start position:0%
needs
 
00:49:11.510 --> 00:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
and then we've been full steam ahead
 
00:49:13.109 --> 00:49:13.119 align:start position:0%
with our vaccination clinics
 
00:49:15.510 --> 00:49:15.520 align:start position:0%
and see that moving you know throughout
 
00:49:16.790 --> 00:49:16.800 align:start position:0%
2021 here
 
00:49:18.790 --> 00:49:18.800 align:start position:0%
of making sure that every veteran who
 
00:49:20.390 --> 00:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
wants a vaccination
 
00:49:22.150 --> 00:49:22.160 align:start position:0%
gets one it's all part of our fight
 
00:49:24.150 --> 00:49:24.160 align:start position:0%
against covent here
 
00:49:26.069 --> 00:49:26.079 align:start position:0%
the last part i'll bring up here is just
 
00:49:27.349 --> 00:49:27.359 align:start position:0%
understanding you know
 
00:49:30.230 --> 00:49:30.240 align:start position:0%
veteran suicide is still the secretary's
 
00:49:32.230 --> 00:49:32.240 align:start position:0%
number one clinical priority
 
00:49:34.790 --> 00:49:34.800 align:start position:0%
and i you know what i would ask of any
 
00:49:36.710 --> 00:49:36.720 align:start position:0%
of you out there is that veteran crisis
 
00:49:37.829 --> 00:49:37.839 align:start position:0%
line number
 
00:49:39.910 --> 00:49:39.920 align:start position:0%
uh is to put that into your cell phone
 
00:49:42.150 --> 00:49:42.160 align:start position:0%
and keep that that you never know
 
00:49:44.150 --> 00:49:44.160 align:start position:0%
uh when you're out there on a saturday
 
00:49:45.910 --> 00:49:45.920 align:start position:0%
night or whatever and seeing a veteran
 
00:49:46.790 --> 00:49:46.800 align:start position:0%
in crisis
 
00:49:48.630 --> 00:49:48.640 align:start position:0%
it could be that phone call away and
 
00:49:50.069 --> 00:49:50.079 align:start position:0%
helping them out
 
00:49:52.950 --> 00:49:52.960 align:start position:0%
and so i i never uh i always take the
 
00:49:54.950 --> 00:49:54.960 align:start position:0%
chance every every audience i get to
 
00:49:56.950 --> 00:49:56.960 align:start position:0%
to promote the veterans crisis line and
 
00:49:58.549 --> 00:49:58.559 align:start position:0%
know that it's out there
 
00:50:00.150 --> 00:50:00.160 align:start position:0%
sorry al i know we got a little hiccup
 
00:50:02.390 --> 00:50:02.400 align:start position:0%
of uh getting going here but
 
00:50:04.390 --> 00:50:04.400 align:start position:0%
uh i'll stop for any any questions and
 
00:50:05.670 --> 00:50:05.680 align:start position:0%
try to keep us on track
 
00:50:07.589 --> 00:50:07.599 align:start position:0%
director forest you've done a great job
 
00:50:09.030 --> 00:50:09.040 align:start position:0%
as usual um
 
00:50:11.109 --> 00:50:11.119 align:start position:0%
brad do we have any questions uh from
 
00:50:13.670 --> 00:50:13.680 align:start position:0%
any of our representatives sorry
 
00:50:15.270 --> 00:50:15.280 align:start position:0%
looks like uh representative the shades
 
00:50:17.190 --> 00:50:17.200 align:start position:0%
has their hand raised
 
00:50:21.589 --> 00:50:21.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:23.349 --> 00:50:23.359 align:start position:0%
i was just wondering if you go back one
 
00:50:24.950 --> 00:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
slide so we could read the phone number
 
00:50:26.630 --> 00:50:26.640 align:start position:0%
again i'm trying to i missed the last
 
00:50:28.230 --> 00:50:28.240 align:start position:0%
two numbers of it just so i can save
 
00:50:29.829 --> 00:50:29.839 align:start position:0%
that in my phone
 
00:50:38.150 --> 00:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
or it is 1-800-273-8255
 
00:50:40.710 --> 00:50:40.720 align:start position:0%
and then you press one just note that is
 
00:50:41.990 --> 00:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
the national
 
00:50:45.190 --> 00:50:45.200 align:start position:0%
uh suicide uh crisis line and then
 
00:50:46.950 --> 00:50:46.960 align:start position:0%
there's a press one option
 
00:50:48.790 --> 00:50:48.800 align:start position:0%
that triggers into the veterans crisis
 
00:50:50.309 --> 00:50:50.319 align:start position:0%
line but it's all networked into the
 
00:50:51.349 --> 00:50:51.359 align:start position:0%
same thing
 
00:50:54.790 --> 00:50:54.800 align:start position:0%
okay okay thank you okay anyone knows
 
00:50:54.800 --> 00:50:55.430 align:start position:0%
okay okay thank you okay anyone knows
brad

00:50:55.430 --> 00:50:55.440 align:start position:0%
brad
 
00:50:58.150 --> 00:50:58.160 align:start position:0%
representative bedford what's up henry's
 
00:50:58.160 --> 00:50:58.790 align:start position:0%
representative bedford what's up henry's
yeah

00:50:58.790 --> 00:50:58.800 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:50:59.829 --> 00:50:59.839 align:start position:0%
i was wondering if you could just
 
00:51:01.910 --> 00:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
clarify i know there is a cboc
 
00:51:04.150 --> 00:51:04.160 align:start position:0%
located in littleton i'm assuming that
 
00:51:05.430 --> 00:51:05.440 align:start position:0%
falls under the white river junction
 
00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:06.549 align:start position:0%
falls under the white river junction
jurisdiction

00:51:06.549 --> 00:51:06.559 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction
 
00:51:09.670 --> 00:51:09.680 align:start position:0%
it does
 
00:51:11.270 --> 00:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
is that just because of geographical
 
00:51:13.430 --> 00:51:13.440 align:start position:0%
location closer to white river junction
 
00:51:14.950 --> 00:51:14.960 align:start position:0%
versus manchester
 
00:51:16.549 --> 00:51:16.559 align:start position:0%
it is and when they looked at that i
 
00:51:18.309 --> 00:51:18.319 align:start position:0%
know they've divided up you
 
00:51:20.470 --> 00:51:20.480 align:start position:0%
the keane seebach is also under white
 
00:51:23.030 --> 00:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
river junctions uh command and control
 
00:51:24.790 --> 00:51:24.800 align:start position:0%
there and i think it's just for that
 
00:51:26.790 --> 00:51:26.800 align:start position:0%
specialty care when they need it you
 
00:51:28.230 --> 00:51:28.240 align:start position:0%
know in in uh
 
00:51:30.150 --> 00:51:30.160 align:start position:0%
kind of the i-91 corridor there of
 
00:51:31.829 --> 00:51:31.839 align:start position:0%
easier to do that referral back to white
 
00:51:33.270 --> 00:51:33.280 align:start position:0%
river junction so
 
00:51:34.870 --> 00:51:34.880 align:start position:0%
it's been arrayed that way since since
 
00:51:38.230 --> 00:51:38.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:40.230 --> 00:51:40.240 align:start position:0%
just wanted to make sure that the folks
 
00:51:41.430 --> 00:51:41.440 align:start position:0%
here knew that there
 
00:51:43.990 --> 00:51:44.000 align:start position:0%
were others within new hampshire they
 
00:51:45.430 --> 00:51:45.440 align:start position:0%
just don't necessarily fault under the
 
00:51:47.910 --> 00:51:47.920 align:start position:0%
manchester jurisdiction versus the white
 
00:51:50.230 --> 00:51:50.240 align:start position:0%
redemption and just to be clear you know
 
00:51:52.230 --> 00:51:52.240 align:start position:0%
when when we get those questions
 
00:51:53.910 --> 00:51:53.920 align:start position:0%
if someone calls you know we do our best
 
00:51:55.270 --> 00:51:55.280 align:start position:0%
to answer just do a
 
00:51:57.430 --> 00:51:57.440 align:start position:0%
soft you know hand off to to the right
 
00:51:58.710 --> 00:51:58.720 align:start position:0%
folks it's not like we say
 
00:52:00.630 --> 00:52:00.640 align:start position:0%
oh that's a vermont thing and you know
 
00:52:02.150 --> 00:52:02.160 align:start position:0%
you have to call them you know we're
 
00:52:06.630 --> 00:52:06.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:09.910 align:start position:0%
 
questions

i'm not going to read the slides i'm
 
00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:33.280 align:start position:0%
just going to try to give you a broad
 
00:54:34.950 --> 00:54:34.960 align:start position:0%
overview of what the new hampshire
 
00:54:36.470 --> 00:54:36.480 align:start position:0%
national guard and the department of
 
00:54:38.069 --> 00:54:38.079 align:start position:0%
military affairs and veterans services
 
00:54:41.829 --> 00:54:41.839 align:start position:0%
is so you know going down memory
 
00:54:44.150 --> 00:54:44.160 align:start position:0%
lane taking a look in the past about two
 
00:54:45.670 --> 00:54:45.680 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
00:54:49.030 --> 00:54:49.040 align:start position:0%
senate bill 209 changed the adjutant
 
00:54:50.950 --> 00:54:50.960 align:start position:0%
general's department into the department
 
00:54:52.309 --> 00:54:52.319 align:start position:0%
of military affairs and veterans
 
00:54:52.319 --> 00:54:53.750 align:start position:0%
of military affairs and veterans
services

00:54:53.750 --> 00:54:53.760 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:54:57.030 --> 00:54:57.040 align:start position:0%
i codified into law to sort of um
 
00:54:59.829 --> 00:54:59.839 align:start position:0%
bring all this disparate veteran sort of
 
00:54:59.839 --> 00:55:00.870 align:start position:0%
bring all this disparate veteran sort of
groups

00:55:00.870 --> 00:55:00.880 align:start position:0%
groups
 
00:55:03.750 --> 00:55:03.760 align:start position:0%
underneath our umbrella i just like to
 
00:55:04.549 --> 00:55:04.559 align:start position:0%
tell people that
 
00:55:07.430 --> 00:55:07.440 align:start position:0%
you know we're everything but healthcare
 
00:55:08.950 --> 00:55:08.960 align:start position:0%
we're not the manchester va
 
00:55:10.549 --> 00:55:10.559 align:start position:0%
you just heard from karen uh kevin
 
00:55:12.870 --> 00:55:12.880 align:start position:0%
forrest and we are not the veterans home
 
00:55:15.270 --> 00:55:15.280 align:start position:0%
we're everything in between so what it
 
00:55:16.789 --> 00:55:16.799 align:start position:0%
did was it brought three different sort
 
00:55:18.549 --> 00:55:18.559 align:start position:0%
of organizations underneath our umbrella
 
00:55:20.549 --> 00:55:20.559 align:start position:0%
and they changed our name
 
00:55:21.990 --> 00:55:22.000 align:start position:0%
when you look at the military affairs
 
00:55:23.750 --> 00:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
aspect of our organization it's
 
00:55:25.670 --> 00:55:25.680 align:start position:0%
primarily the new hampshire army and air
 
00:55:28.470 --> 00:55:28.480 align:start position:0%
national guard when you look across the
 
00:55:30.710 --> 00:55:30.720 align:start position:0%
number of uniformed service members
 
00:55:32.549 --> 00:55:32.559 align:start position:0%
federal civilians and state employees we
 
00:55:35.109 --> 00:55:35.119 align:start position:0%
number just over three thousand
 
00:55:37.270 --> 00:55:37.280 align:start position:0%
now the national guard mission we call
 
00:55:39.910 --> 00:55:39.920 align:start position:0%
it a mission triad it's quite simple
 
00:55:41.270 --> 00:55:41.280 align:start position:0%
our federal mission is to fight and win
 
00:55:43.349 --> 00:55:43.359 align:start position:0%
our nation's wars you know our state
 
00:55:45.109 --> 00:55:45.119 align:start position:0%
mission is to secure the homeland
 
00:55:46.630 --> 00:55:46.640 align:start position:0%
and we talk about securing the homeland
 
00:55:48.390 --> 00:55:48.400 align:start position:0%
is quite simple you'll save lives
 
00:55:50.150 --> 00:55:50.160 align:start position:0%
mitigate human suffering
 
00:55:53.589 --> 00:55:53.599 align:start position:0%
and we also build partnerships yo if you
 
00:55:54.710 --> 00:55:54.720 align:start position:0%
want to talk later on during the
 
00:55:56.069 --> 00:55:56.079 align:start position:0%
question and answer period i can answer
 
00:55:57.270 --> 00:55:57.280 align:start position:0%
any questions you may have about our
 
00:55:58.789 --> 00:55:58.799 align:start position:0%
coveted response or anything we have
 
00:56:00.630 --> 00:56:00.640 align:start position:0%
going on today
 
00:56:02.150 --> 00:56:02.160 align:start position:0%
so let's now go into the military
 
00:56:03.829 --> 00:56:03.839 align:start position:0%
affairs aspect of it all
 
00:56:06.390 --> 00:56:06.400 align:start position:0%
um as i alluded to earlier this myself
 
00:56:07.670 --> 00:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
is the adjutant general
 
00:56:09.750 --> 00:56:09.760 align:start position:0%
and my deputy adjutant general um
 
00:56:11.349 --> 00:56:11.359 align:start position:0%
representative baldesaro knows quite
 
00:56:14.069 --> 00:56:14.079 align:start position:0%
well as a colonel retired warren perry
 
00:56:17.190 --> 00:56:17.200 align:start position:0%
you're with the big two and what this um
 
00:56:19.990 --> 00:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
legislation did when it made the dmavs
 
00:56:21.910 --> 00:56:21.920 align:start position:0%
is it allowed commissioner and deputy
 
00:56:21.920 --> 00:56:23.589 align:start position:0%
is it allowed commissioner and deputy
commissioner-level

00:56:23.589 --> 00:56:23.599 align:start position:0%
commissioner-level
 
00:56:26.150 --> 00:56:26.160 align:start position:0%
advocacy for veterans across a portfolio
 
00:56:27.230 --> 00:56:27.240 align:start position:0%
of different
 
00:56:30.309 --> 00:56:30.319 align:start position:0%
organizations committees for us to
 
00:56:32.390 --> 00:56:32.400 align:start position:0%
advocate for those veterans
 
00:56:35.030 --> 00:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
um the big three that we now do we've
 
00:56:36.470 --> 00:56:36.480 align:start position:0%
always had the veterans
 
00:56:38.870 --> 00:56:38.880 align:start position:0%
cemetery and we're now in charge of the
 
00:56:40.630 --> 00:56:40.640 align:start position:0%
division of veterans services
 
00:56:42.150 --> 00:56:42.160 align:start position:0%
and the division of community-based
 
00:56:44.150 --> 00:56:44.160 align:start position:0%
military programs
 
00:56:46.309 --> 00:56:46.319 align:start position:0%
so those are the big three things so as
 
00:56:47.990 --> 00:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
you scroll down
 
00:56:49.430 --> 00:56:49.440 align:start position:0%
let's just briefly talk about the
 
00:56:51.430 --> 00:56:51.440 align:start position:0%
division of veterans services
 
00:56:53.190 --> 00:56:53.200 align:start position:0%
and these guys are on survivors island
 
00:56:54.950 --> 00:56:54.960 align:start position:0%
uh they're a stand-alone department
 
00:56:57.190 --> 00:56:57.200 align:start position:0%
with no really no overhead or
 
00:56:59.589 --> 00:56:59.599 align:start position:0%
administrative support
 
00:57:01.510 --> 00:57:01.520 align:start position:0%
there's ten of them we have seven
 
00:57:04.309 --> 00:57:04.319 align:start position:0%
full-time veteran service officers
 
00:57:06.630 --> 00:57:06.640 align:start position:0%
it's all about veteran benefits and as
 
00:57:08.069 --> 00:57:08.079 align:start position:0%
you look at the slide you can see the
 
00:57:09.910 --> 00:57:09.920 align:start position:0%
things that they do the services they
 
00:57:09.920 --> 00:57:10.950 align:start position:0%
things that they do the services they
provide

00:57:10.950 --> 00:57:10.960 align:start position:0%
provide
 
00:57:13.510 --> 00:57:13.520 align:start position:0%
but it's all about providing veterans
 
00:57:14.710 --> 00:57:14.720 align:start position:0%
with the appropriate
 
00:57:16.150 --> 00:57:16.160 align:start position:0%
benefits that they have earned through
 
00:57:19.190 --> 00:57:19.200 align:start position:0%
their military service
 
00:57:21.510 --> 00:57:21.520 align:start position:0%
the beauty of this reorganization is
 
00:57:23.910 --> 00:57:23.920 align:start position:0%
you're the human resources the financial
 
00:57:25.910 --> 00:57:25.920 align:start position:0%
the administrative support behind the
 
00:57:25.920 --> 00:57:26.950 align:start position:0%
the administrative support behind the
curtain

00:57:26.950 --> 00:57:26.960 align:start position:0%
curtain
 
00:57:29.190 --> 00:57:29.200 align:start position:0%
is now covered so they can spend more
 
00:57:31.910 --> 00:57:31.920 align:start position:0%
time dealing and helping veterans
 
00:57:33.270 --> 00:57:33.280 align:start position:0%
you can look and see what their
 
00:57:34.710 --> 00:57:34.720 align:start position:0%
throughput is you know they're averaging
 
00:57:37.270 --> 00:57:37.280 align:start position:0%
over 300 appointments a month
 
00:57:39.430 --> 00:57:39.440 align:start position:0%
they do exceptional work and they will
 
00:57:41.109 --> 00:57:41.119 align:start position:0%
rotate and travel throughout the
 
00:57:43.109 --> 00:57:43.119 align:start position:0%
state you know unfortunately right now
 
00:57:44.150 --> 00:57:44.160 align:start position:0%
because of covad
 
00:57:45.670 --> 00:57:45.680 align:start position:0%
most appointments or all appointments
 
00:57:47.829 --> 00:57:47.839 align:start position:0%
are virtual but it really hasn't stopped
 
00:57:49.270 --> 00:57:49.280 align:start position:0%
then with the volume of what they're
 
00:57:52.950 --> 00:57:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:54.150 --> 00:57:54.160 align:start position:0%
when you look at the what's called the
 
00:57:56.150 --> 00:57:56.160 align:start position:0%
division of community-based military
 
00:57:56.160 --> 00:57:57.109 align:start position:0%
division of community-based military
programs

00:57:57.109 --> 00:57:57.119 align:start position:0%
programs
 
00:58:00.230 --> 00:58:00.240 align:start position:0%
it's two state employees they used to be
 
00:58:01.829 --> 00:58:01.839 align:start position:0%
a part of department of health and human
 
00:58:01.839 --> 00:58:03.030 align:start position:0%
a part of department of health and human
services

00:58:03.030 --> 00:58:03.040 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:58:06.069 --> 00:58:06.079 align:start position:0%
they now fall underneath us to dmavs and
 
00:58:08.069 --> 00:58:08.079 align:start position:0%
they are primarily our community
 
00:58:11.190 --> 00:58:11.200 align:start position:0%
outreach uh organization and i'll give
 
00:58:12.549 --> 00:58:12.559 align:start position:0%
you two things and you'll see about a
 
00:58:13.430 --> 00:58:13.440 align:start position:0%
little bit later on
 
00:58:15.990 --> 00:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
is um but let's take this thread about
 
00:58:17.510 --> 00:58:17.520 align:start position:0%
the number of veterans there's a hundred
 
00:58:19.030 --> 00:58:19.040 align:start position:0%
thousand veterans in the state of new
 
00:58:19.040 --> 00:58:20.230 align:start position:0%
thousand veterans in the state of new
hampshire

00:58:20.230 --> 00:58:20.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:58:21.990 --> 00:58:22.000 align:start position:0%
you just heard from the manchester va
 
00:58:23.910 --> 00:58:23.920 align:start position:0%
that 25 000 veterans get care from the
 
00:58:25.670 --> 00:58:25.680 align:start position:0%
manchester va
 
00:58:27.349 --> 00:58:27.359 align:start position:0%
10 000 veterans get care from the white
 
00:58:29.270 --> 00:58:29.280 align:start position:0%
river junction va
 
00:58:31.750 --> 00:58:31.760 align:start position:0%
that leaves 65 000 veterans getting care
 
00:58:34.150 --> 00:58:34.160 align:start position:0%
through their primary care provider
 
00:58:36.069 --> 00:58:36.079 align:start position:0%
so one of the initiatives we have and
 
00:58:37.510 --> 00:58:37.520 align:start position:0%
we've and you'll see it in a subsequent
 
00:58:38.390 --> 00:58:38.400 align:start position:0%
slide is this
 
00:58:41.750 --> 00:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
ask the question campaign so if you're
 
00:58:43.030 --> 00:58:43.040 align:start position:0%
if you're a veteran you go to a primary
 
00:58:45.270 --> 00:58:45.280 align:start position:0%
care provider you can simply ask that
 
00:58:46.710 --> 00:58:46.720 align:start position:0%
what's supposed to happen is that
 
00:58:49.109 --> 00:58:49.119 align:start position:0%
the primary care care provider says you
 
00:58:50.710 --> 00:58:50.720 align:start position:0%
know are you a veteran
 
00:58:53.829 --> 00:58:53.839 align:start position:0%
and if it's yes it then
 
00:58:55.670 --> 00:58:55.680 align:start position:0%
puts you into a set of subsequent
 
00:58:58.150 --> 00:58:58.160 align:start position:0%
questions to tailor the response to that
 
00:58:59.990 --> 00:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
care for that veteran different
 
00:59:01.430 --> 00:59:01.440 align:start position:0%
you know part of us getting after mental
 
00:59:02.710 --> 00:59:02.720 align:start position:0%
health issues part of us trying to
 
00:59:03.990 --> 00:59:04.000 align:start position:0%
tackle suicide
 
00:59:05.510 --> 00:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
so it's really sort of a whole of
 
00:59:07.430 --> 00:59:07.440 align:start position:0%
government approach
 
00:59:09.430 --> 00:59:09.440 align:start position:0%
to you know trying to take care and um
 
00:59:11.510 --> 00:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
advocate for our veterans
 
00:59:13.670 --> 00:59:13.680 align:start position:0%
um so there's two of them the two
 
00:59:15.990 --> 00:59:16.000 align:start position:0%
employees and now they report to us
 
00:59:17.670 --> 00:59:17.680 align:start position:0%
and finally last but not least is the
 
00:59:19.030 --> 00:59:19.040 align:start position:0%
veterans cemetery
 
00:59:21.270 --> 00:59:21.280 align:start position:0%
and uh i think its mission statement is
 
00:59:21.280 --> 00:59:22.230 align:start position:0%
and uh i think its mission statement is
um

00:59:22.230 --> 00:59:22.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:24.710 --> 00:59:24.720 align:start position:0%
is quite obvious to maintain and provide
 
00:59:25.670 --> 00:59:25.680 align:start position:0%
a dignified
 
00:59:27.349 --> 00:59:27.359 align:start position:0%
final resting place to honor all
 
00:59:29.190 --> 00:59:29.200 align:start position:0%
veterans and their families
 
00:59:31.430 --> 00:59:31.440 align:start position:0%
um again we're a rather lean state
 
00:59:31.440 --> 00:59:32.710 align:start position:0%
um again we're a rather lean state
organization

00:59:32.710 --> 00:59:32.720 align:start position:0%
organization
 
00:59:34.870 --> 00:59:34.880 align:start position:0%
we have about 10 state employees nine
 
00:59:36.630 --> 00:59:36.640 align:start position:0%
full-time one part-time at the state
 
00:59:38.230 --> 00:59:38.240 align:start position:0%
veterans cemetery
 
00:59:42.150 --> 00:59:42.160 align:start position:0%
and based upon the demographics and the
 
00:59:45.750 --> 00:59:45.760 align:start position:0%
age of our state's veteran population
 
00:59:48.630 --> 00:59:48.640 align:start position:0%
we are seeing like a large or high
 
00:59:50.230 --> 00:59:50.240 align:start position:0%
number of interments
 
00:59:53.030 --> 00:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
through last year and this year so i
 
00:59:54.549 --> 00:59:54.559 align:start position:0%
think the month of december
 
00:59:56.710 --> 00:59:56.720 align:start position:0%
we had the largest amount of internments
 
00:59:58.230 --> 00:59:58.240 align:start position:0%
for casket burials
 
01:00:01.109 --> 01:00:01.119 align:start position:0%
ever in the uh cemetery's history so
 
01:00:02.549 --> 01:00:02.559 align:start position:0%
it's a lean organization
 
01:00:04.230 --> 01:00:04.240 align:start position:0%
um you know unfortunately because of the
 
01:00:05.910 --> 01:00:05.920 align:start position:0%
age of our world war ii and korea
 
01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:06.630 align:start position:0%
age of our world war ii and korea
veterans

01:00:06.630 --> 01:00:06.640 align:start position:0%
veterans
 
01:00:10.069 --> 01:00:10.079 align:start position:0%
um it's just they are very very busy at
 
01:00:12.950 --> 01:00:12.960 align:start position:0%
um at that location at the cemetery you
 
01:00:14.470 --> 01:00:14.480 align:start position:0%
can see from the slide that a couple of
 
01:00:15.190 --> 01:00:15.200 align:start position:0%
the um
 
01:00:17.670 --> 01:00:17.680 align:start position:0%
you know signature events that we host
 
01:00:19.270 --> 01:00:19.280 align:start position:0%
there at memorial day the hundred nights
 
01:00:20.150 --> 01:00:20.160 align:start position:0%
of remembrance
 
01:00:23.349 --> 01:00:23.359 align:start position:0%
and the reach across bosca win
 
01:00:24.710 --> 01:00:24.720 align:start position:0%
and finally i don't want to belabor it
 
01:00:26.150 --> 01:00:26.160 align:start position:0%
is the state business administration
 
01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:27.030 align:start position:0%
is the state business administration
office

01:00:27.030 --> 01:00:27.040 align:start position:0%
office
 
01:00:29.270 --> 01:00:29.280 align:start position:0%
that's like i said alluded to earlier
 
01:00:31.750 --> 01:00:31.760 align:start position:0%
that's the administrative or support
 
01:00:33.829 --> 01:00:33.839 align:start position:0%
that helps these leaner organizations
 
01:00:35.670 --> 01:00:35.680 align:start position:0%
tackle and get after the veteran aspect
 
01:00:36.390 --> 01:00:36.400 align:start position:0%
of uh
 
01:00:39.670 --> 01:00:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:41.349 --> 01:00:41.359 align:start position:0%
finally hopefully you're seeing slide
 
01:00:43.430 --> 01:00:43.440 align:start position:0%
for this titled initiatives
 
01:00:45.030 --> 01:00:45.040 align:start position:0%
i won't go through all of them i covered
 
01:00:47.270 --> 01:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
one of them the ask the question ask
 
01:00:50.549 --> 01:00:50.559 align:start position:0%
link collaborate 2.0 and the beauty of
 
01:00:52.069 --> 01:00:52.079 align:start position:0%
that is um
 
01:00:54.789 --> 01:00:54.799 align:start position:0%
like i alluded to earlier you now have
 
01:00:57.910 --> 01:00:57.920 align:start position:0%
department level advocacy for veterans
 
01:00:59.990 --> 01:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
so i sit on the governor's commission of
 
01:01:01.829 --> 01:01:01.839 align:start position:0%
alcohol and other drugs of which i
 
01:01:04.390 --> 01:01:04.400 align:start position:0%
chair the joint military task force it
 
01:01:05.990 --> 01:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
allows us to advocate for
 
01:01:08.549 --> 01:01:08.559 align:start position:0%
you know we have three lines of effort
 
01:01:10.150 --> 01:01:10.160 align:start position:0%
it's always service members
 
01:01:12.710 --> 01:01:12.720 align:start position:0%
families and the veteran community and
 
01:01:14.950 --> 01:01:14.960 align:start position:0%
we advocate for you know how can we help
 
01:01:16.789 --> 01:01:16.799 align:start position:0%
each one of those sort of groups of uh
 
01:01:16.799 --> 01:01:18.230 align:start position:0%
each one of those sort of groups of uh
constituents

01:01:18.230 --> 01:01:18.240 align:start position:0%
constituents
 
01:01:19.829 --> 01:01:19.839 align:start position:0%
and then with warren also sits as my
 
01:01:21.589 --> 01:01:21.599 align:start position:0%
delegate on the council of housing
 
01:01:21.599 --> 01:01:22.710 align:start position:0%
delegate on the council of housing
stability

01:01:22.710 --> 01:01:22.720 align:start position:0%
stability
 
01:01:24.470 --> 01:01:24.480 align:start position:0%
so like i said like you know we are
 
01:01:26.390 --> 01:01:26.400 align:start position:0%
present at a lot of places you know
 
01:01:27.430 --> 01:01:27.440 align:start position:0%
we're always president
 
01:01:29.829 --> 01:01:29.839 align:start position:0%
uh when representative baldesaro sits on
 
01:01:32.950 --> 01:01:32.960 align:start position:0%
this uh state veterans advisory council
 
01:01:35.829 --> 01:01:35.839 align:start position:0%
so we believe we're at the appropriate
 
01:01:35.839 --> 01:01:36.390 align:start position:0%
so we believe we're at the appropriate
level

01:01:36.390 --> 01:01:36.400 align:start position:0%
level
 
01:01:39.030 --> 01:01:39.040 align:start position:0%
meetings to advocate for the veterans
 
01:01:40.549 --> 01:01:40.559 align:start position:0%
throughout the state for
 
01:01:43.589 --> 01:01:43.599 align:start position:0%
any issue other than health care
 
01:01:45.750 --> 01:01:45.760 align:start position:0%
and then we're you know we work quite
 
01:01:47.510 --> 01:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
we're really in tune and um
 
01:01:49.190 --> 01:01:49.200 align:start position:0%
with kevin force in the manchester va
 
01:01:51.510 --> 01:01:51.520 align:start position:0%
and peggy lebreck from the veterans home
 
01:01:54.630 --> 01:01:54.640 align:start position:0%
and i think we tied all together one
 
01:01:56.069 --> 01:01:56.079 align:start position:0%
initiative i'd like to before i get to
 
01:01:57.270 --> 01:01:57.280 align:start position:0%
the final slide is to just
 
01:01:59.430 --> 01:01:59.440 align:start position:0%
you know discuss a little bit about is
 
01:02:01.430 --> 01:02:01.440 align:start position:0%
um it's called the veterans friendly
 
01:02:04.390 --> 01:02:04.400 align:start position:0%
business recognition program
 
01:02:05.750 --> 01:02:05.760 align:start position:0%
and if you don't remember anything of
 
01:02:07.829 --> 01:02:07.839 align:start position:0%
which i say today please remember this
 
01:02:09.430 --> 01:02:09.440 align:start position:0%
one line
 
01:02:12.230 --> 01:02:12.240 align:start position:0%
service member for life you know that's
 
01:02:13.750 --> 01:02:13.760 align:start position:0%
why we are so passionate about those of
 
01:02:15.109 --> 01:02:15.119 align:start position:0%
us in uniform for those
 
01:02:17.829 --> 01:02:17.839 align:start position:0%
that came before us but it's all about
 
01:02:20.069 --> 01:02:20.079 align:start position:0%
being a service member soldier for life
 
01:02:22.230 --> 01:02:22.240 align:start position:0%
um you know the day you take off that
 
01:02:23.510 --> 01:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
uniform doesn't make
 
01:02:25.270 --> 01:02:25.280 align:start position:0%
make you lose those values you're still
 
01:02:26.789 --> 01:02:26.799 align:start position:0%
a valuable contributing member of
 
01:02:28.630 --> 01:02:28.640 align:start position:0%
communities in our society and we
 
01:02:30.069 --> 01:02:30.079 align:start position:0%
advocate for that
 
01:02:31.670 --> 01:02:31.680 align:start position:0%
you know one initiative we started this
 
01:02:32.950 --> 01:02:32.960 align:start position:0%
past year through our division of
 
01:02:35.430 --> 01:02:35.440 align:start position:0%
community-based military programs
 
01:02:36.870 --> 01:02:36.880 align:start position:0%
was his veterans friendly business
 
01:02:38.549 --> 01:02:38.559 align:start position:0%
recognition event
 
01:02:41.589 --> 01:02:41.599 align:start position:0%
and we've got it from scratch and we had
 
01:02:43.029 --> 01:02:43.039 align:start position:0%
a virtual event
 
01:02:45.910 --> 01:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
about a month ago in partnership with
 
01:02:48.150 --> 01:02:48.160 align:start position:0%
employment security
 
01:02:50.710 --> 01:02:50.720 align:start position:0%
to acknowledge 19 businesses throughout
 
01:02:52.470 --> 01:02:52.480 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:02:55.270 --> 01:02:55.280 align:start position:0%
who provide services or resources that
 
01:02:58.309 --> 01:02:58.319 align:start position:0%
support veterans in our state
 
01:02:59.990 --> 01:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
it was exceptional it was the first
 
01:03:01.829 --> 01:03:01.839 align:start position:0%
event ever and we're we're really
 
01:03:04.150 --> 01:03:04.160 align:start position:0%
excited and rolling that out and seeing
 
01:03:05.990 --> 01:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
what's falling with more to come for
 
01:03:08.710 --> 01:03:08.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:10.309 --> 01:03:10.319 align:start position:0%
then finally my last slide that
 
01:03:11.670 --> 01:03:11.680 align:start position:0%
hopefully you can see it's called
 
01:03:14.829 --> 01:03:14.839 align:start position:0%
current legislative priorities
 
01:03:16.870 --> 01:03:16.880 align:start position:0%
um there's a lot of things in the
 
01:03:18.710 --> 01:03:18.720 align:start position:0%
legislature right now
 
01:03:20.549 --> 01:03:20.559 align:start position:0%
those are the some one some of the ones
 
01:03:21.910 --> 01:03:21.920 align:start position:0%
that you know we are
 
01:03:24.230 --> 01:03:24.240 align:start position:0%
you know say focused on and if i would
 
01:03:26.390 --> 01:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
have to ask it would be for your support
 
01:03:28.309 --> 01:03:28.319 align:start position:0%
in some of these endeavors
 
01:03:30.710 --> 01:03:30.720 align:start position:0%
and the first one is it's uh you know
 
01:03:32.910 --> 01:03:32.920 align:start position:0%
senator carson put an lsr
 
01:03:36.470 --> 01:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
1066 for us and what we're trying to do
 
01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:36.870 align:start position:0%
1066 for us and what we're trying to do
is

01:03:36.870 --> 01:03:36.880 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:03:40.230 --> 01:03:40.240 align:start position:0%
you know we have well the ultimate
 
01:03:41.109 --> 01:03:41.119 align:start position:0%
challenge for us
 
01:03:44.390 --> 01:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
is the biggest challenge for the
 
01:03:46.309 --> 01:03:46.319 align:start position:0%
department of defense
 
01:03:49.270 --> 01:03:49.280 align:start position:0%
as an all-volunteer force is to maintain
 
01:03:51.270 --> 01:03:51.280 align:start position:0%
the future sessions of people joining
 
01:03:53.510 --> 01:03:53.520 align:start position:0%
our force
 
01:03:57.750 --> 01:03:57.760 align:start position:0%
today 71 of today's youth is ineligible
 
01:03:57.760 --> 01:03:57.990 align:start position:0%
today 71 of today's youth is ineligible
for

01:03:57.990 --> 01:03:58.000 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:04:02.230 --> 01:04:02.240 align:start position:0%
military service eighty percent of
 
01:04:04.390 --> 01:04:04.400 align:start position:0%
our new recruits come from a military
 
01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:05.670 align:start position:0%
our new recruits come from a military
family

01:04:05.670 --> 01:04:05.680 align:start position:0%
family
 
01:04:08.150 --> 01:04:08.160 align:start position:0%
we are the dire consequences from trying
 
01:04:09.990 --> 01:04:10.000 align:start position:0%
to fill our formations to get that next
 
01:04:12.789 --> 01:04:12.799 align:start position:0%
generation to serve
 
01:04:14.789 --> 01:04:14.799 align:start position:0%
last year we changed the statute that
 
01:04:14.799 --> 01:04:15.829 align:start position:0%
last year we changed the statute that
allowed

01:04:15.829 --> 01:04:15.839 align:start position:0%
allowed
 
01:04:18.789 --> 01:04:18.799 align:start position:0%
um soldiers and airmen when they joined
 
01:04:20.549 --> 01:04:20.559 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire national guard get
 
01:04:22.950 --> 01:04:22.960 align:start position:0%
free tuition at a state university it's
 
01:04:25.430 --> 01:04:25.440 align:start position:0%
a tuition waiver
 
01:04:26.870 --> 01:04:26.880 align:start position:0%
usually occurred after they completed
 
01:04:28.630 --> 01:04:28.640 align:start position:0%
their basic and advanced military
 
01:04:30.789 --> 01:04:30.799 align:start position:0%
training or their tech school
 
01:04:33.430 --> 01:04:33.440 align:start position:0%
we changed that statute to now be that
 
01:04:35.109 --> 01:04:35.119 align:start position:0%
the day you raise your hand and you
 
01:04:36.549 --> 01:04:36.559 align:start position:0%
swear into the new hampshire national
 
01:04:36.559 --> 01:04:37.109 align:start position:0%
swear into the new hampshire national
guard

01:04:37.109 --> 01:04:37.119 align:start position:0%
guard
 
01:04:39.190 --> 01:04:39.200 align:start position:0%
with this army or air you're now
 
01:04:40.870 --> 01:04:40.880 align:start position:0%
entitled to that benefit of a tuition
 
01:04:43.190 --> 01:04:43.200 align:start position:0%
waiver in state university
 
01:04:44.470 --> 01:04:44.480 align:start position:0%
so that helps us with sort of the
 
01:04:46.710 --> 01:04:46.720 align:start position:0%
recruiting and accessions um
 
01:04:49.750 --> 01:04:49.760 align:start position:0%
it's not enough um there's no line at
 
01:04:50.710 --> 01:04:50.720 align:start position:0%
our door
 
01:04:52.630 --> 01:04:52.640 align:start position:0%
uh we are constantly struggling to
 
01:04:53.829 --> 01:04:53.839 align:start position:0%
recruit that next generation
 
01:04:55.430 --> 01:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
specifically in the army
 
01:04:58.870 --> 01:04:58.880 align:start position:0%
and what this legislation does is
 
01:05:00.390 --> 01:05:00.400 align:start position:0%
we would change what was a state
 
01:05:02.230 --> 01:05:02.240 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund to an
 
01:05:05.270 --> 01:05:05.280 align:start position:0%
enlistment incentive program that would
 
01:05:07.349 --> 01:05:07.359 align:start position:0%
allow a financial incentive to a
 
01:05:07.359 --> 01:05:08.069 align:start position:0%
allow a financial incentive to a
guardsmen

01:05:08.069 --> 01:05:08.079 align:start position:0%
guardsmen
 
01:05:10.309 --> 01:05:10.319 align:start position:0%
of the lower ranks can get another
 
01:05:12.870 --> 01:05:12.880 align:start position:0%
person to join our formation
 
01:05:15.349 --> 01:05:15.359 align:start position:0%
that's why it's so important the house
 
01:05:15.359 --> 01:05:16.069 align:start position:0%
that's why it's so important the house
bill

01:05:16.069 --> 01:05:16.079 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:05:19.190 --> 01:05:19.200 align:start position:0%
117 that's really it was approved last
 
01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:20.150 align:start position:0%
117 that's really it was approved last
legislative

01:05:20.150 --> 01:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
legislative
 
01:05:22.230 --> 01:05:22.240 align:start position:0%
cycle it was unfortunately vetoed in an
 
01:05:23.670 --> 01:05:23.680 align:start position:0%
on the bus package
 
01:05:25.349 --> 01:05:25.359 align:start position:0%
and representative graham i think is
 
01:05:26.710 --> 01:05:26.720 align:start position:0%
advocating for that one on our behalf
 
01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:28.150 align:start position:0%
advocating for that one on our behalf
again

01:05:28.150 --> 01:05:28.160 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:05:32.870 --> 01:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
lsr 353 self-explanatory
 
01:05:35.270 --> 01:05:35.280 align:start position:0%
and finally the last legislative cycle
 
01:05:37.029 --> 01:05:37.039 align:start position:0%
um veterans there was a veterans bill of
 
01:05:39.190 --> 01:05:39.200 align:start position:0%
right that was proposed and approved and
 
01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:40.309 align:start position:0%
right that was proposed and approved and
passed

01:05:40.309 --> 01:05:40.319 align:start position:0%
passed
 
01:05:42.390 --> 01:05:42.400 align:start position:0%
um you know it mandated certain things
 
01:05:44.230 --> 01:05:44.240 align:start position:0%
for us to do
 
01:05:47.109 --> 01:05:47.119 align:start position:0%
um the fiscal note that we provided said
 
01:05:48.630 --> 01:05:48.640 align:start position:0%
you know we can't do without the
 
01:05:50.150 --> 01:05:50.160 align:start position:0%
resources and we require
 
01:05:52.069 --> 01:05:52.079 align:start position:0%
three additional staff if you want us to
 
01:05:53.910 --> 01:05:53.920 align:start position:0%
do the things that are listed on the
 
01:05:55.990 --> 01:05:56.000 align:start position:0%
the slide so i would just say that as
 
01:05:57.109 --> 01:05:57.119 align:start position:0%
you take a look uh
 
01:05:58.549 --> 01:05:58.559 align:start position:0%
and you have to make decisions this
 
01:06:00.950 --> 01:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
legislative cycle
 
01:06:03.190 --> 01:06:03.200 align:start position:0%
would be honored to do it uh we just
 
01:06:04.549 --> 01:06:04.559 align:start position:0%
don't have the depth to do it
 
01:06:06.950 --> 01:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
without the resources and subject to
 
01:06:11.349 --> 01:06:11.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:13.990 --> 01:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
okay um brad do we have any questions
 
01:06:18.309 --> 01:06:18.319 align:start position:0%
for the general
 
01:06:21.589 --> 01:06:21.599 align:start position:0%
anonymous panelists but does look like
 
01:06:23.990 --> 01:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
um edwards and attendees does have his
 
01:06:25.510 --> 01:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
hand raised i'm not sure if you want to
 
01:06:26.309 --> 01:06:26.319 align:start position:0%
recognize him
 
01:06:28.870 --> 01:06:28.880 align:start position:0%
yeah i recognize the colonel lieutenant
 
01:06:30.710 --> 01:06:30.720 align:start position:0%
colonel i should say in the army
 
01:06:33.990 --> 01:06:34.000 align:start position:0%
he can complained to the general uh uh
 
01:06:35.270 --> 01:06:35.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:06:38.870 --> 01:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
um i i am currently serving as the uh
 
01:06:39.990 --> 01:06:40.000 align:start position:0%
chair of the
 
01:06:43.829 --> 01:06:43.839 align:start position:0%
uh veterans affairs caucus
 
01:06:46.789 --> 01:06:46.799 align:start position:0%
of the house and and in that position i
 
01:06:48.950 --> 01:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
would like to ask the general
 
01:06:52.309 --> 01:06:52.319 align:start position:0%
if he's uh thinks that they may support
 
01:06:54.390 --> 01:06:54.400 align:start position:0%
or have a position on
 
01:06:58.150 --> 01:06:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:01.430 --> 01:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
have new hampshire law become consistent
 
01:07:03.109 --> 01:07:03.119 align:start position:0%
with federal law
 
01:07:05.910 --> 01:07:05.920 align:start position:0%
when it comes to having veterans
 
01:07:08.069 --> 01:07:08.079 align:start position:0%
disability pay
 
01:07:13.190 --> 01:07:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:16.950 --> 01:07:16.960 align:start position:0%
currently federal law says that
 
01:07:20.950 --> 01:07:20.960 align:start position:0%
that disability pay is meant to go
 
01:07:23.990 --> 01:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
directly to the veteran and is not to be
 
01:07:26.950 --> 01:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
divided amongst family members but in
 
01:07:28.470 --> 01:07:28.480 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
01:07:31.910 --> 01:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
they are uh the courts are are
 
01:07:35.430 --> 01:07:35.440 align:start position:0%
garnishing disability pay and i'm just
 
01:07:36.789 --> 01:07:36.799 align:start position:0%
curious if uh
 
01:07:38.870 --> 01:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
if you all will be taking a position on
 
01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:41.510 align:start position:0%
if you all will be taking a position on
that

01:07:41.510 --> 01:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:43.430 --> 01:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
sir i assume we will i'm just not
 
01:07:44.789 --> 01:07:44.799 align:start position:0%
familiar enough with this
 
01:07:47.109 --> 01:07:47.119 align:start position:0%
this uh legislation to comment on it
 
01:07:48.230 --> 01:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
right now i'm gonna have to do some
 
01:07:49.349 --> 01:07:49.359 align:start position:0%
research with warren
 
01:07:52.710 --> 01:07:52.720 align:start position:0%
to see what its impacts are okay and
 
01:07:55.670 --> 01:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
and as a follow-up will mr perry be
 
01:07:57.510 --> 01:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
sticking around for the full year you
 
01:07:57.520 --> 01:07:58.069 align:start position:0%
sticking around for the full year you
think

01:07:58.069 --> 01:07:58.079 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:07:59.829 --> 01:07:59.839 align:start position:0%
is he getting ready to retire from his
 
01:07:59.839 --> 01:08:01.109 align:start position:0%
is he getting ready to retire from his
retiring

01:08:01.109 --> 01:08:01.119 align:start position:0%
retiring
 
01:08:02.630 --> 01:08:02.640 align:start position:0%
uh i hope he's saying i hope he's
 
01:08:04.789 --> 01:08:04.799 align:start position:0%
sticking around for the full year
 
01:08:06.630 --> 01:08:06.640 align:start position:0%
okay because he's been great to work
 
01:08:09.190 --> 01:08:09.200 align:start position:0%
with oh yeah he's exceptional
 
01:08:11.750 --> 01:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
thank you ron's not going nowhere he's
 
01:08:14.230 --> 01:08:14.240 align:start position:0%
here to stay
 
01:08:16.630 --> 01:08:16.640 align:start position:0%
general um i'm actually the sponsor of
 
01:08:17.430 --> 01:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
that bill
 
01:08:20.070 --> 01:08:20.080 align:start position:0%
uh and of course i'm sure you'll see
 
01:08:21.910 --> 01:08:21.920 align:start position:0%
more about it because it's causing some
 
01:08:23.990 --> 01:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
of our veterans to be homeless
 
01:08:25.829 --> 01:08:25.839 align:start position:0%
and for the federal law it's not a
 
01:08:27.269 --> 01:08:27.279 align:start position:0%
marital asset
 
01:08:30.550 --> 01:08:30.560 align:start position:0%
but somehow uh the judges have put that
 
01:08:33.669 --> 01:08:33.679 align:start position:0%
disability into the formula when it
 
01:08:34.309 --> 01:08:34.319 align:start position:0%
comes to
 
01:08:37.349 --> 01:08:37.359 align:start position:0%
child support in other and the federal
 
01:08:39.110 --> 01:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
law states that there's an apportionment
 
01:08:40.709 --> 01:08:40.719 align:start position:0%
that's a requirement
 
01:08:42.550 --> 01:08:42.560 align:start position:0%
to be sent to the va the department of
 
01:08:44.789 --> 01:08:44.799 align:start position:0%
veterans are fierce for approval
 
01:08:47.829 --> 01:08:47.839 align:start position:0%
through the courts to the va uh and not
 
01:08:49.510 --> 01:08:49.520 align:start position:0%
just automatically take the money out
 
01:08:50.950 --> 01:08:50.960 align:start position:0%
but that's another day
 
01:08:52.709 --> 01:08:52.719 align:start position:0%
but i uh are there any other questions
 
01:08:55.349 --> 01:08:55.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:57.590 --> 01:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
i'm not saying any hands raised okay
 
01:08:59.189 --> 01:08:59.199 align:start position:0%

are known as the welch or the tar units
 
01:10:16.070 --> 01:10:16.080 align:start position:0%
and those are for veterans pretty much
 
01:10:19.350 --> 01:10:19.360 align:start position:0%

heavily medical
 
01:10:23.189 --> 01:10:23.199 align:start position:0%
but they do not have um a risk of
 
01:10:23.199 --> 01:10:25.590 align:start position:0%
but they do not have um a risk of
wandering

01:10:25.590 --> 01:10:25.600 align:start position:0%
wandering
 
01:10:28.149 --> 01:10:28.159 align:start position:0%
um a hundred of those beds live on our
 
01:10:30.470 --> 01:10:30.480 align:start position:0%

and they are only behind those doors
 
01:10:47.189 --> 01:10:47.199 align:start position:0%
if they are a danger to themselves of

as long as they were gowned up
 
01:13:02.070 --> 01:13:02.080 align:start position:0%
and had mass on and be able to visit
 
01:13:04.870 --> 01:13:04.880 align:start position:0%

01:13:42.870 --> 01:13:42.880 align:start position:0%
the other thing i wanted to go into is
 
01:13:45.270 --> 01:13:45.280 align:start position:0%
eligibility for our veterans
 
01:13:47.590 --> 01:13:47.600 align:start position:0%
each state across the nation is
 
01:13:49.510 --> 01:13:49.520 align:start position:0%
different on our eligibility
 
01:13:53.270 --> 01:13:53.280 align:start position:0%
we are enabled by our um are established
 
01:13:55.590 --> 01:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
under chapter 119
 
01:13:58.709 --> 01:13:58.719 align:start position:0%

under defined under 38 usc section 101
 
01:14:09.350 --> 01:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
but what new hampshire does that's very
 
01:14:10.790 --> 01:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
different than other states is we've
 
01:14:13.030 --> 01:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
included our reserve units
 
01:14:15.750 --> 01:14:15.760 align:start position:0%
for our army and our air national guard
 
01:14:16.550 --> 01:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
as long as they
 
01:14:19.189 --> 01:14:19.199 align:start position:0%
were honorably discharged they are
 
01:14:20.790 --> 01:14:20.800 align:start position:0%

each one of these veterans must have
 
01:14:27.189 --> 01:14:27.199 align:start position:0%
lived for one year in the state of new
 
01:14:27.199 --> 01:14:28.229 align:start position:0%

01:14:28.229 --> 01:14:28.239 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:14:30.550 --> 01:14:30.560 align:start position:0%
or as i would call be a son or a
 
01:14:32.229 --> 01:14:32.239 align:start position:0%
daughter of new hampshire
 
01:14:34.709 --> 01:14:34.719 align:start position:0%
where their dd214 states they went into
 
01:14:36.550 --> 01:14:36.560 align:start position:0%
the service from new hampshire or they
 
01:14:37.830 --> 01:14:37.840 align:start position:0%
returned home
 
01:14:41.110 --> 01:14:41.120 align:start position:0%
from to new hampshire to be eligible
 
01:14:43.669 --> 01:14:43.679 align:start position:0%

home
 
01:14:47.830 --> 01:14:47.840 align:start position:0%
and of course the final eligibility is
 
01:14:49.350 --> 01:14:49.360 align:start position:0%
that the fact that the new hampshire
 
01:14:51.270 --> 01:14:51.280 align:start position:0%
veterans home are actually able to care
 
01:14:51.280 --> 01:14:51.910 align:start position:0%
veterans home are actually able to care
for

01:14:51.910 --> 01:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:14:54.630 --> 01:14:54.640 align:start position:0%
that veteran and one instance that i
 
01:14:55.430 --> 01:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
will um
 
01:14:58.470 --> 01:14:58.480 align:start position:0%
tell you is the only time in the last
 
01:14:59.430 --> 01:14:59.440 align:start position:0%
probably year
 
01:15:02.070 --> 01:15:02.080 align:start position:0%
um is if we feel that that veteran is a
 
01:15:04.630 --> 01:15:04.640 align:start position:0%
danger to himself or others and not able
 
01:15:06.470 --> 01:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
to live in community
 
01:15:07.990 --> 01:15:08.000 align:start position:0%
all of our neighborhoods are open
 
01:15:09.510 --> 01:15:09.520 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods where
 
01:15:13.350 --> 01:15:13.360 align:start position:0%
the smallest number is approximately 14
 
01:15:15.430 --> 01:15:15.440 align:start position:0%
veterans living on a neighborhood and so
 
01:15:17.030 --> 01:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
we would not want to have
 
01:15:18.709 --> 01:15:18.719 align:start position:0%
someone admitted to that neighborhood
 
01:15:23.590 --> 01:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:25.510 --> 01:15:25.520 align:start position:0%
uh some of our initiatives that we have
 
01:15:27.030 --> 01:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
been working on the last
 
01:15:29.510 --> 01:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
year uh we are putting in a new brand
 
01:15:31.590 --> 01:15:31.600 align:start position:0%
new nurse call stations throughout the
 
01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:32.470 align:start position:0%
new nurse call stations throughout the
home

01:15:32.470 --> 01:15:32.480 align:start position:0%
home
 
01:15:35.830 --> 01:15:35.840 align:start position:0%
um that has been um
 
01:15:38.709 --> 01:15:38.719 align:start position:0%
kind of delayed due to the covid
 
01:15:38.719 --> 01:15:39.990 align:start position:0%
kind of delayed due to the covid
pandemic

01:15:39.990 --> 01:15:40.000 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
01:15:42.550 --> 01:15:42.560 align:start position:0%
but that it has been input into all
 
01:15:43.910 --> 01:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
areas that are not residential
 
01:15:43.920 --> 01:15:44.790 align:start position:0%
areas that are not residential
neighborhoods

01:15:44.790 --> 01:15:44.800 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods
 
01:15:47.030 --> 01:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
and we are waiting until we can get the
 
01:15:48.950 --> 01:15:48.960 align:start position:0%
um that wrapped up
 
01:15:50.790 --> 01:15:50.800 align:start position:0%
we have a sprinkler system upgrade and
 
01:15:52.550 --> 01:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
repair being done
 
01:15:54.709 --> 01:15:54.719 align:start position:0%
again they're working around the areas
 
01:15:57.110 --> 01:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
where the residents live in
 
01:15:59.590 --> 01:15:59.600 align:start position:0%
we have a heat bump heat pump
 
01:16:01.189 --> 01:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
replacement out to bid
 
01:16:04.149 --> 01:16:04.159 align:start position:0%
currently with public works we've done
 
01:16:05.990 --> 01:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
many security upgrades around the
 
01:16:10.070 --> 01:16:10.080 align:start position:0%
home as well as cameras in common areas
 
01:16:12.070 --> 01:16:12.080 align:start position:0%
and cameras in the parking lots
 
01:16:14.470 --> 01:16:14.480 align:start position:0%
to maintain the safety of both our staff
 
01:16:16.790 --> 01:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
and residents
 
01:16:18.149 --> 01:16:18.159 align:start position:0%
one of the other initiatives that we're
 
01:16:20.550 --> 01:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
working on currently is we have
 
01:16:22.950 --> 01:16:22.960 align:start position:0%
a staffing issues we currently are
 
01:16:24.149 --> 01:16:24.159 align:start position:0%
looking for
 
01:16:26.350 --> 01:16:26.360 align:start position:0%
18 lnas
 
01:16:26.360 --> 01:16:29.189 align:start position:0%
18 lnas
[Music]

01:16:29.189 --> 01:16:29.199 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:16:33.270 --> 01:16:33.280 align:start position:0%
two lpns eight rns over a variety of
 
01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:34.149 align:start position:0%
two lpns eight rns over a variety of
shifts

01:16:34.149 --> 01:16:34.159 align:start position:0%
shifts
 
01:16:35.990 --> 01:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
so what we're doing is we've actually
 
01:16:37.350 --> 01:16:37.360 align:start position:0%
are working with
 
01:16:39.910 --> 01:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
the licensing bureau of licensing to
 
01:16:41.430 --> 01:16:41.440 align:start position:0%
provide our own education
 
01:16:43.669 --> 01:16:43.679 align:start position:0%
and training program to anybody who's
 
01:16:45.590 --> 01:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
interested in becoming an lna
 
01:16:48.310 --> 01:16:48.320 align:start position:0%
and so we are doing a grassroots effort
 
01:16:49.669 --> 01:16:49.679 align:start position:0%
to grow our own
 
01:16:51.669 --> 01:16:51.679 align:start position:0%
so if we have dietary housekeeping or
 
01:16:53.110 --> 01:16:53.120 align:start position:0%
laundry staff who would like to take
 
01:16:54.310 --> 01:16:54.320 align:start position:0%
that training
 
01:16:56.470 --> 01:16:56.480 align:start position:0%
we are going to be providing that and we
 
01:16:58.229 --> 01:16:58.239 align:start position:0%
will be a licensed facility
 
01:17:01.510 --> 01:17:01.520 align:start position:0%
in order to get more lnas
 
01:17:04.950 --> 01:17:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:07.189 --> 01:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
one of the other of our initiatives that
 
01:17:09.030 --> 01:17:09.040 align:start position:0%
i did not include
 
01:17:11.110 --> 01:17:11.120 align:start position:0%
on this list was we are enhancing our
 
01:17:12.790 --> 01:17:12.800 align:start position:0%
electronic medical record
 
01:17:15.270 --> 01:17:15.280 align:start position:0%
which currently we are doing business
 
01:17:16.070 --> 01:17:16.080 align:start position:0%
with point click
 
01:17:19.110 --> 01:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
care we would like our lab that we do at
 
01:17:20.630 --> 01:17:20.640 align:start position:0%
different locations able to be
 
01:17:22.709 --> 01:17:22.719 align:start position:0%
downloaded directly into that electronic
 
01:17:24.229 --> 01:17:24.239 align:start position:0%
medical record
 
01:17:25.910 --> 01:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
currently right now our medical records
 
01:17:27.830 --> 01:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
staff have to scan them in
 
01:17:31.830 --> 01:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
to the records um
 
01:17:35.750 --> 01:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
and that is my update um
 
01:17:38.470 --> 01:17:38.480 align:start position:0%
and al our representative baldassaro sir
 
01:17:40.070 --> 01:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
i'll turn it over to you if you have any
 
01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:40.870 align:start position:0%
i'll turn it over to you if you have any
questions

01:17:40.870 --> 01:17:40.880 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:17:43.030 --> 01:17:43.040 align:start position:0%
yeah um i'm sure somebody's gonna have
 
01:17:45.189 --> 01:17:45.199 align:start position:0%
some questions but before we go to the
 
01:17:48.229 --> 01:17:48.239 align:start position:0%
the committee i remember a few years ago
 
01:17:49.990 --> 01:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
there was a study that was done and when
 
01:17:51.669 --> 01:17:51.679 align:start position:0%
you were speaking it popped in my brain
 
01:17:51.679 --> 01:17:52.709 align:start position:0%
you were speaking it popped in my brain
there

01:17:52.709 --> 01:17:52.719 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:17:55.189 --> 01:17:55.199 align:start position:0%
um did the nursing home the veterans
 
01:17:58.709 --> 01:17:58.719 align:start position:0%
home ever get certified
 
01:18:01.669 --> 01:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
certified with hoosier with the state or
 
01:18:03.430 --> 01:18:03.440 align:start position:0%
like other nursing homes are required to
 
01:18:04.870 --> 01:18:04.880 align:start position:0%
be certified
 
01:18:06.709 --> 01:18:06.719 align:start position:0%
uh we get certified every year through
 
01:18:08.310 --> 01:18:08.320 align:start position:0%
the va um
 
01:18:11.350 --> 01:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
va central office we are not certified
 
01:18:12.390 --> 01:18:12.400 align:start position:0%
through the central
 
01:18:14.790 --> 01:18:14.800 align:start position:0%
um medicare or medicaid services is that
 
01:18:15.590 --> 01:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
what you
 
01:18:18.950 --> 01:18:18.960 align:start position:0%
see right now is there any benefit to
 
01:18:20.950 --> 01:18:20.960 align:start position:0%
being certified to the medicare you know
 
01:18:22.310 --> 01:18:22.320 align:start position:0%
to these other programs
 
01:18:24.470 --> 01:18:24.480 align:start position:0%
that they have there when we looked into
 
01:18:25.510 --> 01:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
it there was not
 
01:18:28.070 --> 01:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
in fact we have um we are in a better
 
01:18:28.080 --> 01:18:28.630 align:start position:0%
in fact we have um we are in a better
position

01:18:28.630 --> 01:18:28.640 align:start position:0%
position
 
01:18:31.990 --> 01:18:32.000 align:start position:0%
as we sit because as a state agency
 
01:18:34.149 --> 01:18:34.159 align:start position:0%
we can get into some of their programs
 
01:18:35.350 --> 01:18:35.360 align:start position:0%
through cms
 
01:18:38.790 --> 01:18:38.800 align:start position:0%
but are not um have as many and actually
 
01:18:42.070 --> 01:18:42.080 align:start position:0%
the va survey process mirrors the cms
 
01:18:43.750 --> 01:18:43.760 align:start position:0%
process like jayco
 
01:18:46.550 --> 01:18:46.560 align:start position:0%
and so all the care standards of care
 
01:18:47.750 --> 01:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
are the same
 
01:18:50.390 --> 01:18:50.400 align:start position:0%
um so they're really when we looked at
 
01:18:51.750 --> 01:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
it monetarily
 
01:18:55.189 --> 01:18:55.199 align:start position:0%
um there was not a um
 
01:18:58.310 --> 01:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
not a good reason to we don't lose no
 
01:19:00.149 --> 01:19:00.159 align:start position:0%
money from medicare or medicaid or
 
01:19:01.030 --> 01:19:01.040 align:start position:0%
anything because you're still getting
 
01:19:02.870 --> 01:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
this burdened for the va right
 
01:19:04.870 --> 01:19:04.880 align:start position:0%
that is correct we have we receive per
 
01:19:06.630 --> 01:19:06.640 align:start position:0%
diem from the va
 
01:19:08.790 --> 01:19:08.800 align:start position:0%
for every resident that is in bed per
 
01:19:10.390 --> 01:19:10.400 align:start position:0%
day and then
 
01:19:12.229 --> 01:19:12.239 align:start position:0%
we get a higher per diem for any
 
01:19:14.470 --> 01:19:14.480 align:start position:0%
residents that are 70 to 100 percent
 
01:19:17.669 --> 01:19:17.679 align:start position:0%
it's known as the full pay so based on
 
01:19:19.110 --> 01:19:19.120 align:start position:0%
their rug scores
 
01:19:21.189 --> 01:19:21.199 align:start position:0%
we receive a certain dollar per resident
 
01:19:22.149 --> 01:19:22.159 align:start position:0%
per bed
 
01:19:24.870 --> 01:19:24.880 align:start position:0%
um so it's two different um calculations
 
01:19:27.030 --> 01:19:27.040 align:start position:0%
based on the days in bed
 
01:19:29.030 --> 01:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
okay thank you my last question for you
 
01:19:30.310 --> 01:19:30.320 align:start position:0%
is i know
 
01:19:32.070 --> 01:19:32.080 align:start position:0%
not only you but other nursing homes
 
01:19:34.950 --> 01:19:34.960 align:start position:0%
having problems with hiring staff
 
01:19:37.830 --> 01:19:37.840 align:start position:0%
rockingham county we just raised the um
 
01:19:39.830 --> 01:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
you know the hour the wages
 
01:19:43.030 --> 01:19:43.040 align:start position:0%
and for nurses lpns and everyone else in
 
01:19:46.310 --> 01:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
that the category uh have you i did
 
01:19:48.550 --> 01:19:48.560 align:start position:0%
did we do that recently for the for you
 
01:19:48.560 --> 01:19:51.030 align:start position:0%
did we do that recently for the for you
uh

01:19:51.030 --> 01:19:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:53.270 --> 01:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
at governor and council we went forward
 
01:19:53.280 --> 01:19:54.630 align:start position:0%
at governor and council we went forward
approximately

01:19:54.630 --> 01:19:54.640 align:start position:0%
approximately
 
01:19:56.070 --> 01:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
i want to say five years ago
 
01:19:58.070 --> 01:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
representative and got a 20
 
01:20:01.270 --> 01:20:01.280 align:start position:0%
enhancement for our nursing um level
 
01:20:01.280 --> 01:20:02.229 align:start position:0%
enhancement for our nursing um level
employees

01:20:02.229 --> 01:20:02.239 align:start position:0%
employees
 
01:20:05.430 --> 01:20:05.440 align:start position:0%
so those are licensed nurses and lpns
 
01:20:07.669 --> 01:20:07.679 align:start position:0%
the um people that we feel that probably
 
01:20:09.350 --> 01:20:09.360 align:start position:0%
are lagging behind in that
 
01:20:11.510 --> 01:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
is that um licensed nursing assistants
 
01:20:12.790 --> 01:20:12.800 align:start position:0%
do not qualify
 
01:20:16.390 --> 01:20:16.400 align:start position:0%
to be on the same scout salary scale
 
01:20:19.990 --> 01:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
as nurses so that's where we've had
 
01:20:23.510 --> 01:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
a little bit of lag on the salaries
 
01:20:26.310 --> 01:20:26.320 align:start position:0%
we have worked with both the governor's
 
01:20:28.310 --> 01:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
office and the union to try to see what
 
01:20:29.110 --> 01:20:29.120 align:start position:0%
we can do
 
01:20:32.390 --> 01:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
to look at that via an enhancement
 
01:20:35.510 --> 01:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
and or a shift differential for those
 
01:20:37.750 --> 01:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
staff members all right thank you
 
01:20:41.910 --> 01:20:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:44.550 --> 01:20:44.560 align:start position:0%
representative uh buckowitz has their
 
01:20:45.510 --> 01:20:45.520 align:start position:0%
hand up
 
01:20:48.390 --> 01:20:48.400 align:start position:0%
okay representative thank you for taking
 
01:20:49.189 --> 01:20:49.199 align:start position:0%
my question
 
01:20:52.550 --> 01:20:52.560 align:start position:0%
i'm just wondering with the shortage in
 
01:20:55.350 --> 01:20:55.360 align:start position:0%
staffing um has there been any
 
01:20:56.950 --> 01:20:56.960 align:start position:0%
connection with say
 
01:20:59.030 --> 01:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
for example the state nursing programs
 
01:21:00.870 --> 01:21:00.880 align:start position:0%
like keene state college
 
01:21:04.229 --> 01:21:04.239 align:start position:0%
as a nursing program should be ahead of
 
01:21:05.830 --> 01:21:05.840 align:start position:0%
that program be
 
01:21:09.270 --> 01:21:09.280 align:start position:0%
supplying students who are close to
 
01:21:09.280 --> 01:21:10.229 align:start position:0%
supplying students who are close to
being

01:21:10.229 --> 01:21:10.239 align:start position:0%
being
 
01:21:14.149 --> 01:21:14.159 align:start position:0%
rnas rns rather
 
01:21:17.430 --> 01:21:17.440 align:start position:0%
um to help out we do have
 
01:21:20.470 --> 01:21:20.480 align:start position:0%
a um an agreement with both unh
 
01:21:23.270 --> 01:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
plymouth state and so whenever they have
 
01:21:24.870 --> 01:21:24.880 align:start position:0%
nursing students that need to do their
 
01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:25.990 align:start position:0%
nursing students that need to do their
clinicals

01:21:25.990 --> 01:21:26.000 align:start position:0%
clinicals
 
01:21:28.149 --> 01:21:28.159 align:start position:0%
prior to the coven 19 we've had them
 
01:21:29.030 --> 01:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
come in
 
01:21:30.870 --> 01:21:30.880 align:start position:0%
and been very fortunate that many of
 
01:21:32.470 --> 01:21:32.480 align:start position:0%
them will work
 
01:21:34.390 --> 01:21:34.400 align:start position:0%
whether it's on you know school
 
01:21:36.550 --> 01:21:36.560 align:start position:0%
vacations and weekends and nights when
 
01:21:37.430 --> 01:21:37.440 align:start position:0%
they can
 
01:21:39.590 --> 01:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
um and we've been very fortunate with
 
01:21:42.070 --> 01:21:42.080 align:start position:0%
the social worker program as well that
 
01:21:42.080 --> 01:21:42.550 align:start position:0%
the social worker program as well that
we

01:21:42.550 --> 01:21:42.560 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:21:45.110 --> 01:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
again we did internships here so we were
 
01:21:46.470 --> 01:21:46.480 align:start position:0%
able to what i would call
 
01:21:48.790 --> 01:21:48.800 align:start position:0%
cherry pick um some wonderful students
 
01:21:50.149 --> 01:21:50.159 align:start position:0%
from those
 
01:21:52.470 --> 01:21:52.480 align:start position:0%
in the last year we've seen less of that
 
01:21:53.350 --> 01:21:53.360 align:start position:0%
due to the
 
01:21:57.030 --> 01:21:57.040 align:start position:0%
um i would say the covid19 scare
 
01:22:01.189 --> 01:22:01.199 align:start position:0%
that many of the students um were
 
01:22:03.990 --> 01:22:04.000 align:start position:0%
less less willing to come into it under
 
01:22:05.830 --> 01:22:05.840 align:start position:0%
the nursing home
 
01:22:09.189 --> 01:22:09.199 align:start position:0%

organizations within the state
 
01:30:29.110 --> 01:30:29.120 align:start position:0%
potential actions by the u.s congress
 
01:30:30.950 --> 01:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
which will have a major impact on the
 
01:30:32.149 --> 01:30:32.159 align:start position:0%
state in the new
 
01:30:34.629 --> 01:30:34.639 align:start position:0%

01:30:38.870 --> 01:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
the congress are any matter to maintain
 
01:30:38.880 --> 01:30:40.149 align:start position:0%
the congress are any matter to maintain
communications

01:30:40.149 --> 01:30:40.159 align:start position:0%
communications
 
01:30:41.990 --> 01:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
with the congressional delegation to
 
01:30:44.149 --> 01:30:44.159 align:start position:0%
serve as a liaison between
 
01:30:45.750 --> 01:30:45.760 align:start position:0%
new hampshire house and the united
 
01:30:48.470 --> 01:30:48.480 align:start position:0%
states congress emergency management and
 
01:30:51.189 --> 01:30:51.199 align:start position:0%
such other matters as may be referred to
 
01:30:51.199 --> 01:30:52.229 align:start position:0%
such other matters as may be referred to
it

01:30:52.229 --> 01:30:52.239 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:30:54.709 --> 01:30:54.719 align:start position:0%
okay and that isn't within our rules of
 
01:30:55.669 --> 01:30:55.679 align:start position:0%
the house
 
01:30:57.750 --> 01:30:57.760 align:start position:0%
and every year that when we vote on our
 
01:30:57.760 --> 01:30:59.510 align:start position:0%
and every year that when we vote on our
rules

01:30:59.510 --> 01:30:59.520 align:start position:0%
rules
 
01:31:02.550 --> 01:31:02.560 align:start position:0%
that is what goes on now
 
01:31:04.629 --> 01:31:04.639 align:start position:0%
if you go down to the bottom real quick
 
01:31:05.990 --> 01:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
and you'll see
 
01:31:09.270 --> 01:31:09.280 align:start position:0%
uh where i get up here on the different
 
01:31:10.470 --> 01:31:10.480 align:start position:0%
types of
 
01:31:13.430 --> 01:31:13.440 align:start position:0%
resolutions that come forward let me see
 
01:31:14.310 --> 01:31:14.320 align:start position:0%
if i can get them all
 
01:31:17.590 --> 01:31:17.600 align:start position:0%
in here okay
 
01:31:19.510 --> 01:31:19.520 align:start position:0%
uh that we deal with on the four types
 
01:31:22.390 --> 01:31:22.400 align:start position:0%
of uh resolutions
 
01:31:24.470 --> 01:31:24.480 align:start position:0%
um this we're gonna have a problem with
 
01:31:26.390 --> 01:31:26.400 align:start position:0%
resolutions and the reason why
 
01:31:29.910 --> 01:31:29.920 align:start position:0%
is when years ago the house and senate
 
01:31:32.149 --> 01:31:32.159 align:start position:0%
boat heard resolutions
 
01:31:34.070 --> 01:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
over the last five years four or five
 
01:31:35.430 --> 01:31:35.440 align:start position:0%
years or so the senate
 
01:31:38.390 --> 01:31:38.400 align:start position:0%
refused to hear resolutions from the
 
01:31:40.629 --> 01:31:40.639 align:start position:0%
house and they have a policy there
 
01:31:43.270 --> 01:31:43.280 align:start position:0%
where it will take only a certain
 
01:31:44.790 --> 01:31:44.800 align:start position:0%
percentage of the senators
 
01:31:46.870 --> 01:31:46.880 align:start position:0%
agree and then they will take on a
 
01:31:46.880 --> 01:31:48.310 align:start position:0%
agree and then they will take on a
resolution

01:31:48.310 --> 01:31:48.320 align:start position:0%
resolution
 
01:31:50.790 --> 01:31:50.800 align:start position:0%
so even though we pass a resolution in
 
01:31:50.800 --> 01:31:51.910 align:start position:0%
so even though we pass a resolution in
committee

01:31:51.910 --> 01:31:51.920 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:31:55.030 --> 01:31:55.040 align:start position:0%
that does not mean that um it's going to
 
01:31:57.430 --> 01:31:57.440 align:start position:0%
happen it's going to go forward
 
01:31:59.910 --> 01:31:59.920 align:start position:0%
okay um now you all you should have got
 
01:32:01.830 --> 01:32:01.840 align:start position:0%
that that i sent you on the rules of the
 
01:32:01.840 --> 01:32:03.830 align:start position:0%
that that i sent you on the rules of the
committee

01:32:03.830 --> 01:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:32:07.030 --> 01:32:07.040 align:start position:0%
okay um so you have an idea
 
01:32:08.790 --> 01:32:08.800 align:start position:0%
on what goes on in the committee or
 
01:32:10.550 --> 01:32:10.560 align:start position:0%
what's required by
 
01:32:14.070 --> 01:32:14.080 align:start position:0%
the house we work off rules
 
01:32:17.270 --> 01:32:17.280 align:start position:0%
okay and i'm a i'm a process guy i'm a
 
01:32:19.510 --> 01:32:19.520 align:start position:0%
stickler on the roof as linda
 
01:32:21.270 --> 01:32:21.280 align:start position:0%
mastermiller will tell you
 
01:32:23.189 --> 01:32:23.199 align:start position:0%
and uh you know and make sure that the
 
01:32:24.790 --> 01:32:24.800 align:start position:0%
committee is in compliance with the
 
01:32:24.800 --> 01:32:25.669 align:start position:0%
committee is in compliance with the
rules

01:32:25.669 --> 01:32:25.679 align:start position:0%
rules
 
01:32:28.149 --> 01:32:28.159 align:start position:0%
very focused on mason rules also for our
 
01:32:28.159 --> 01:32:29.270 align:start position:0%
very focused on mason rules also for our
committee

01:32:29.270 --> 01:32:29.280 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:32:31.750 --> 01:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
so if you see something that's going not
 
01:32:32.390 --> 01:32:32.400 align:start position:0%
being done
 
01:32:35.430 --> 01:32:35.440 align:start position:0%
properly bring it up
 
01:32:37.590 --> 01:32:37.600 align:start position:0%
you know bring it up uh do not be as you
 
01:32:40.629 --> 01:32:40.639 align:start position:0%
know uh set back
 
01:32:42.870 --> 01:32:42.880 align:start position:0%
and you know let it go if you know
 
01:32:44.149 --> 01:32:44.159 align:start position:0%
something's being done
 
01:32:46.709 --> 01:32:46.719 align:start position:0%
wrong because even though i've been on
 
01:32:47.910 --> 01:32:47.920 align:start position:0%
that committee for years been the
 
01:32:49.830 --> 01:32:49.840 align:start position:0%
chairman before vice chair
 
01:32:52.390 --> 01:32:52.400 align:start position:0%
i'm not perfect and i'm far from perfect
 
01:32:54.709 --> 01:32:54.719 align:start position:0%
so i'll be the first one to tell you
 
01:32:56.629 --> 01:32:56.639 align:start position:0%
okay but we're a team and we'll work
 
01:32:58.149 --> 01:32:58.159 align:start position:0%
together we'll make sure we're in the
 
01:32:58.159 --> 01:32:59.270 align:start position:0%
together we'll make sure we're in the
requirement

01:32:59.270 --> 01:32:59.280 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
01:33:02.310 --> 01:33:02.320 align:start position:0%
you know in accordance with the rules
 
01:33:15.110 --> 01:33:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:17.510 --> 01:33:17.520 align:start position:0%

issues
 
01:33:46.470 --> 01:33:46.480 align:start position:0%
with you having a pad at the desk
 
01:33:48.229 --> 01:33:48.239 align:start position:0%
but i don't what we don't want to see is

time or somebody's speaking
 
01:33:57.910 --> 01:33:57.920 align:start position:0%

have a reputation
 
01:34:07.189 --> 01:34:07.199 align:start position:0%
of uh when somebody says something and i
 
01:34:10.470 --> 01:34:10.480 align:start position:0%
believe it's true or being able to be
 
01:34:13.590 --> 01:34:13.600 align:start position:0%
brought out the wrong way i always look
 
01:34:13.600 --> 01:34:14.709 align:start position:0%
brought out the wrong way i always look
up

01:34:14.709 --> 01:34:14.719 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:34:17.030 --> 01:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
trust i believe in trust by verify see
 
01:34:18.950 --> 01:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
linda laffin over there
 
01:34:22.070 --> 01:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
okay so uh you know that's me and to
 
01:34:23.750 --> 01:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
make sure that you get the right
 
01:34:25.189 --> 01:34:25.199 align:start position:0%
information because there's certain
 
01:34:27.350 --> 01:34:27.360 align:start position:0%
times i will ask questions
 
01:34:30.070 --> 01:34:30.080 align:start position:0%
that i i already know the answers but i
 
01:34:32.229 --> 01:34:32.239 align:start position:0%
only ask those questions so the freshmen
 
01:34:33.910 --> 01:34:33.920 align:start position:0%
on up will understand and know what's
 
01:34:34.709 --> 01:34:34.719 align:start position:0%
going on
 
01:34:37.830 --> 01:34:37.840 align:start position:0%
or what the correct answer is so
 
01:34:40.149 --> 01:34:40.159 align:start position:0%
if you see me asking questions at times
 
01:34:41.430 --> 01:34:41.440 align:start position:0%
it's only for the benefit of the
 
01:34:43.189 --> 01:34:43.199 align:start position:0%
committee basically
 
01:34:45.030 --> 01:34:45.040 align:start position:0%
and to see you know what the answer is
 
01:34:47.350 --> 01:34:47.360 align:start position:0%
of the person testifying
 
01:34:50.390 --> 01:34:50.400 align:start position:0%
okay because it's only fear
 
01:34:52.950 --> 01:34:52.960 align:start position:0%
that you know what i know and you know
 
01:34:54.709 --> 01:34:54.719 align:start position:0%
since i've been on there for 14 years
 
01:34:55.750 --> 01:34:55.760 align:start position:0%
and you know
 
01:34:57.430 --> 01:34:57.440 align:start position:0%
what representative master miller knows
 
01:34:59.590 --> 01:34:59.600 align:start position:0%
because she's been on there for years
 
01:35:01.590 --> 01:35:01.600 align:start position:0%
okay so we don't mind sharing the
 
01:35:02.709 --> 01:35:02.719 align:start position:0%
knowledge there and
 
01:35:05.830 --> 01:35:05.840 align:start position:0%
making it uh important what i just
 
01:35:09.830 --> 01:35:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:12.629 --> 01:35:12.639 align:start position:0%
remember one sec here i just noticed
 
01:35:12.639 --> 01:35:13.030 align:start position:0%
remember one sec here i just noticed
that

01:35:13.030 --> 01:35:13.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:35:18.310 --> 01:35:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:22.470 --> 01:35:22.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:25.350 --> 01:35:25.360 align:start position:0%
yeah here we go are you seeing my screen
 
01:35:25.360 --> 01:35:27.270 align:start position:0%
yeah here we go are you seeing my screen
now

01:35:27.270 --> 01:35:27.280 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:35:29.109 --> 01:35:29.119 align:start position:0%
all right see now there's a temporary
 
01:35:30.709 --> 01:35:30.719 align:start position:0%
setback right there because somebody
 
01:35:31.990 --> 01:35:32.000 align:start position:0%
should have said they represented where
 
01:35:33.990 --> 01:35:34.000 align:start position:0%
the hell is your screen
 
01:35:37.109 --> 01:35:37.119 align:start position:0%
it's not up there can you all hear me
 
01:35:39.910 --> 01:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
yes sir i got we can hear you okay good
 
01:35:39.920 --> 01:35:40.390 align:start position:0%
yes sir i got we can hear you okay good
i

01:35:40.390 --> 01:35:40.400 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:35:42.070 --> 01:35:42.080 align:start position:0%
i thought i screwed up for a second
 
01:35:44.070 --> 01:35:44.080 align:start position:0%
there all right i
 
01:35:45.430 --> 01:35:45.440 align:start position:0%
i thought it might have been just my
 
01:35:47.109 --> 01:35:47.119 align:start position:0%
screen but now uh
 
01:35:48.870 --> 01:35:48.880 align:start position:0%
i see it was everybody so we're good
 
01:35:50.790 --> 01:35:50.800 align:start position:0%
we're good now i did tell you i'm not
 
01:35:52.550 --> 01:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
perfect right
 
01:35:54.629 --> 01:35:54.639 align:start position:0%
okay so i'm not scared to say that but
 
01:35:56.709 --> 01:35:56.719 align:start position:0%
anyways um
 
01:35:59.669 --> 01:35:59.679 align:start position:0%
those are the rules and the um per the
 
01:36:01.910 --> 01:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
rules on the resolutions and other stuff
 
01:36:04.229 --> 01:36:04.239 align:start position:0%
study those and learn them so that way
 
01:36:06.790 --> 01:36:06.800 align:start position:0%
you know what goes on in committee
 
01:36:09.030 --> 01:36:09.040 align:start position:0%
it is very important on the one rule
 
01:36:10.070 --> 01:36:10.080 align:start position:0%
they're under 105
 
01:36:13.030 --> 01:36:13.040 align:start position:0%
that are require a quorum is required to
 
01:36:14.709 --> 01:36:14.719 align:start position:0%
transact business now what does that
 
01:36:14.719 --> 01:36:15.830 align:start position:0%
transact business now what does that
mean

01:36:15.830 --> 01:36:15.840 align:start position:0%
mean
 
01:36:17.910 --> 01:36:17.920 align:start position:0%
it does not mean that you need a quorum
 
01:36:20.550 --> 01:36:20.560 align:start position:0%
for a um
 
01:36:23.030 --> 01:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
hearing although it should it's
 
01:36:24.550 --> 01:36:24.560 align:start position:0%
disrespectful if we don't have
 
01:36:24.560 --> 01:36:25.910 align:start position:0%
disrespectful if we don't have
representatives

01:36:25.910 --> 01:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
01:36:29.189 --> 01:36:29.199 align:start position:0%
um a majority in the committee room uh
 
01:36:30.709 --> 01:36:30.719 align:start position:0%
for these people that are taking the
 
01:36:32.629 --> 01:36:32.639 align:start position:0%
time out to come and speak
 
01:36:35.030 --> 01:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
we owe that to the public to make sure
 
01:36:36.870 --> 01:36:36.880 align:start position:0%
that we're there to listen
 
01:36:38.709 --> 01:36:38.719 align:start position:0%
if for some reason you're going to be
 
01:36:41.270 --> 01:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
late okay very quietly
 
01:36:43.590 --> 01:36:43.600 align:start position:0%
if we're in the uh committee room walk
 
01:36:45.430 --> 01:36:45.440 align:start position:0%
in and just go take a seat
 
01:36:47.590 --> 01:36:47.600 align:start position:0%
some chairman rather where you wait and
 
01:36:49.510 --> 01:36:49.520 align:start position:0%
stand and wait until the speaker who's
 
01:36:50.390 --> 01:36:50.400 align:start position:0%
sitting there
 
01:36:53.109 --> 01:36:53.119 align:start position:0%
gets done speaking i have no issue with
 
01:36:53.119 --> 01:36:53.590 align:start position:0%
gets done speaking i have no issue with
you

01:36:53.590 --> 01:36:53.600 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:36:56.310 --> 01:36:56.320 align:start position:0%
walking in quietly and go sit down if
 
01:36:57.510 --> 01:36:57.520 align:start position:0%
you have to make a
 
01:36:59.990 --> 01:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
uh a head call if you've got a bathroom
 
01:37:01.590 --> 01:37:01.600 align:start position:0%
call or you gotta
 
01:37:02.950 --> 01:37:02.960 align:start position:0%
you know for some reason you don't feel
 
01:37:05.109 --> 01:37:05.119 align:start position:0%
too good or whatever just get up and
 
01:37:05.990 --> 01:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
walk you walk out
 
01:37:08.950 --> 01:37:08.960 align:start position:0%
of the committee room okay uh you will
 
01:37:11.590 --> 01:37:11.600 align:start position:0%
notice at times i will stand
 
01:37:14.310 --> 01:37:14.320 align:start position:0%
okay uh and stand behind my chair and
 
01:37:14.320 --> 01:37:14.629 align:start position:0%
okay uh and stand behind my chair and
and

01:37:14.629 --> 01:37:14.639 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:37:16.149 --> 01:37:16.159 align:start position:0%
the reason for that because i have
 
01:37:18.550 --> 01:37:18.560 align:start position:0%
arthritis in my pelvis people think i'm
 
01:37:20.790 --> 01:37:20.800 align:start position:0%
an active guy but i have no
 
01:37:23.270 --> 01:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
choice because i don't take medication
 
01:37:25.030 --> 01:37:25.040 align:start position:0%
while i'm up at the state house there so
 
01:37:27.590 --> 01:37:27.600 align:start position:0%
i do stand a lot so you will see me
 
01:37:29.350 --> 01:37:29.360 align:start position:0%
get up out of my chair but that don't
 
01:37:31.109 --> 01:37:31.119 align:start position:0%
mean i'm leaving the room i'm just
 
01:37:33.669 --> 01:37:33.679 align:start position:0%
standing because i have little issues
 
01:37:35.590 --> 01:37:35.600 align:start position:0%
with my spine
 
01:37:37.350 --> 01:37:37.360 align:start position:0%
uh and that's the same thing with others
 
01:37:38.870 --> 01:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
if you you know because some
 
01:37:41.430 --> 01:37:41.440 align:start position:0%
some committee hearings are going to get
 
01:37:43.910 --> 01:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
repetitious some are going to get boring
 
01:37:45.750 --> 01:37:45.760 align:start position:0%
or some are going to be you know that
 
01:37:47.510 --> 01:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
you're in go for an hour or two
 
01:37:49.109 --> 01:37:49.119 align:start position:0%
depending on how many people show up to
 
01:37:49.119 --> 01:37:50.709 align:start position:0%
depending on how many people show up to
testify

01:37:50.709 --> 01:37:50.719 align:start position:0%
testify
 
01:37:53.990 --> 01:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
so if you need to get up like uh to go
 
01:37:55.830 --> 01:37:55.840 align:start position:0%
take a break whatever you do that and
 
01:37:57.030 --> 01:37:57.040 align:start position:0%
you come back in
 
01:37:59.030 --> 01:37:59.040 align:start position:0%
but now the executive sessions are the
 
01:37:59.040 --> 01:38:00.709 align:start position:0%
but now the executive sessions are the
key

01:38:00.709 --> 01:38:00.719 align:start position:0%
key
 
01:38:03.350 --> 01:38:03.360 align:start position:0%
when we call for a vote in the executive
 
01:38:04.390 --> 01:38:04.400 align:start position:0%
session on a bill
 
01:38:07.510 --> 01:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
you have to be present if you walk
 
01:38:10.629 --> 01:38:10.639 align:start position:0%
in after we call for a vote then you
 
01:38:13.669 --> 01:38:13.679 align:start position:0%
will not be able to vote on that bill
 
01:38:15.750 --> 01:38:15.760 align:start position:0%
so keep that in mind there when you're
 
01:38:17.430 --> 01:38:17.440 align:start position:0%
getting up to walk out or where we're in
 
01:38:18.550 --> 01:38:18.560 align:start position:0%
executive session
 
01:38:20.390 --> 01:38:20.400 align:start position:0%
or when we're debating a bill if you had
 
01:38:21.590 --> 01:38:21.600 align:start position:0%
a run to the head
 
01:38:23.990 --> 01:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
if you let me know ahead of time and i
 
01:38:25.590 --> 01:38:25.600 align:start position:0%
know that's where you're going and
 
01:38:27.109 --> 01:38:27.119 align:start position:0%
you'll be back in a minute
 
01:38:29.510 --> 01:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
then i will out of respect for democrats
 
01:38:32.390 --> 01:38:32.400 align:start position:0%
and republicans i will hold up the vote
 
01:38:35.750 --> 01:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
okay until you get back into the room
 
01:38:37.910 --> 01:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
okay as i don't have to but i will do
 
01:38:39.510 --> 01:38:39.520 align:start position:0%
that because i believe it's a team
 
01:38:41.030 --> 01:38:41.040 align:start position:0%
effort that we're doing
 
01:38:42.950 --> 01:38:42.960 align:start position:0%
and i at one time because a couple of
 
01:38:44.950 --> 01:38:44.960 align:start position:0%
democrats have made a mistake on their
 
01:38:44.960 --> 01:38:45.750 align:start position:0%
democrats have made a mistake on their
vote

01:38:45.750 --> 01:38:45.760 align:start position:0%
vote
 
01:38:47.350 --> 01:38:47.360 align:start position:0%
and i didn't want to see him get picked
 
01:38:49.189 --> 01:38:49.199 align:start position:0%
on with their other democrats
 
01:38:52.629 --> 01:38:52.639 align:start position:0%
i re considered a bill for them even
 
01:38:53.669 --> 01:38:53.679 align:start position:0%
because they were supporting the
 
01:38:55.750 --> 01:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
republican position
 
01:38:56.790 --> 01:38:56.800 align:start position:0%
but i think i don't know if
 
01:38:58.470 --> 01:38:58.480 align:start position:0%
representative massa miller was with us
 
01:39:00.950 --> 01:39:00.960 align:start position:0%
at the time but i reconsidered the bill
 
01:39:03.430 --> 01:39:03.440 align:start position:0%
so they can vote the right way and would
 
01:39:03.440 --> 01:39:04.070 align:start position:0%
so they can vote the right way and would
not

01:39:04.070 --> 01:39:04.080 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:39:06.709 --> 01:39:06.719 align:start position:0%
catch hell from others because they
 
01:39:07.750 --> 01:39:07.760 align:start position:0%
didn't they thought they should have
 
01:39:09.109 --> 01:39:09.119 align:start position:0%
voted a certain way
 
01:39:10.629 --> 01:39:10.639 align:start position:0%
so that's the type of guy i am just so
 
01:39:13.990 --> 01:39:14.000 align:start position:0%
you know that yeah now
 
01:39:15.590 --> 01:39:15.600 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to see now i'm going to go
 
01:39:17.990 --> 01:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
around uh one at a time here and we'll
 
01:39:21.109 --> 01:39:21.119 align:start position:0%
if somebody introduce yourself and
 
01:39:22.629 --> 01:39:22.639 align:start position:0%
you know we can get ready to close us
 
01:39:24.790 --> 01:39:24.800 align:start position:0%
out if and tell us a little bit about
 
01:39:26.070 --> 01:39:26.080 align:start position:0%
yourself if you're a veteran
 
01:39:29.510 --> 01:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
let us know that you're a veteran and um
 
01:39:32.070 --> 01:39:32.080 align:start position:0%
that you you've been with the committee
 
01:39:32.080 --> 01:39:32.870 align:start position:0%
that you you've been with the committee
um

01:39:32.870 --> 01:39:32.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:35.510 --> 01:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
okay so give everyone a chance here uh
 
01:39:39.990 --> 01:39:40.000 align:start position:0%
dave lundgren you there
 
01:39:41.990 --> 01:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
dave i know i've seen him on earlier
 
01:39:43.350 --> 01:39:43.360 align:start position:0%
dave is a doctor
 
01:39:46.229 --> 01:39:46.239 align:start position:0%
uh chiropractor so he told me he was
 
01:39:47.990 --> 01:39:48.000 align:start position:0%

office while he was working on patients
 
01:39:49.840 --> 01:39:50.790 align:start position:0%
office while he was working on patients
so

01:39:50.790 --> 01:39:50.800 align:start position:0%

01:39:52.470 --> 01:39:52.480 align:start position:0%

um i just have a couple of questions
 
01:51:15.270 --> 01:51:15.280 align:start position:0%
just to clarify
 
01:51:18.550 --> 01:51:18.560 align:start position:0%
um as far as hearings and executive
 
01:51:18.560 --> 01:51:19.430 align:start position:0%
um as far as hearings and executive
sessions

01:51:19.430 --> 01:51:19.440 align:start position:0%
sessions
 
01:51:22.470 --> 01:51:22.480 align:start position:0%
they are going to be hybrid both
 
01:51:25.910 --> 01:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
or now no the um
 
01:51:28.390 --> 01:51:28.400 align:start position:0%
the regular hearings with the public
 
01:51:29.669 --> 01:51:29.679 align:start position:0%
first of all right now the way it's
 
01:51:31.189 --> 01:51:31.199 align:start position:0%
designed is the public
 
01:51:33.109 --> 01:51:33.119 align:start position:0%
will not be coming into the state house
 
01:51:34.150 --> 01:51:34.160 align:start position:0%
they'll be um
 
01:51:34.160 --> 01:51:35.430 align:start position:0%
they'll be um
[Music]

01:51:35.430 --> 01:51:35.440 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:51:38.149 --> 01:51:38.159 align:start position:0%
a hybrid as far as the state reps right
 
01:51:38.159 --> 01:51:38.709 align:start position:0%
a hybrid as far as the state reps right
now

01:51:38.709 --> 01:51:38.719 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:51:40.470 --> 01:51:40.480 align:start position:0%
if they cannot come in or they're scared
 
01:51:42.310 --> 01:51:42.320 align:start position:0%
of the covet they're
 
01:51:45.189 --> 01:51:45.199 align:start position:0%
going to give them a break on the um the
 
01:51:47.669 --> 01:51:47.679 align:start position:0%
regular committee hearings then
 
01:51:50.709 --> 01:51:50.719 align:start position:0%
we will do hybrid with them but
 
01:51:52.629 --> 01:51:52.639 align:start position:0%
the executive sessions if you're scared
 
01:51:54.470 --> 01:51:54.480 align:start position:0%
and can't come in then i want you there
 
01:51:55.669 --> 01:51:55.679 align:start position:0%
to do your job
 
01:51:58.470 --> 01:51:58.480 align:start position:0%
as you're elected to do then you'll have
 
01:52:00.550 --> 01:52:00.560 align:start position:0%
to get a replacement
 
01:52:03.510 --> 01:52:03.520 align:start position:0%
because my executive sessions will be a
 
01:52:04.870 --> 01:52:04.880 align:start position:0%
face to face
 
01:52:07.350 --> 01:52:07.360 align:start position:0%
okay okay and then the other question
 
01:52:08.070 --> 01:52:08.080 align:start position:0%
that um
 
01:52:11.189 --> 01:52:11.199 align:start position:0%
some of the members had um asked me
 
01:52:11.199 --> 01:52:11.669 align:start position:0%
some of the members had um asked me
about

01:52:11.669 --> 01:52:11.679 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:52:15.270 --> 01:52:15.280 align:start position:0%
was um if you come in for in-person
 
01:52:18.550 --> 01:52:18.560 align:start position:0%
session will you have to wear masks um
 
01:52:23.510 --> 01:52:23.520 align:start position:0%
yes uh right now my understanding is yes
 
01:52:26.149 --> 01:52:26.159 align:start position:0%
uh i'll be straightforward with you now
 
01:52:26.790 --> 01:52:26.800 align:start position:0%
i have
 
01:52:29.189 --> 01:52:29.199 align:start position:0%
just had an operation two months ago on
 
01:52:31.189 --> 01:52:31.199 align:start position:0%
my vocal voice box
 
01:52:34.149 --> 01:52:34.159 align:start position:0%
um i have sinus issues from the military
 
01:52:34.159 --> 01:52:34.470 align:start position:0%
um i have sinus issues from the military
uh

01:52:34.470 --> 01:52:34.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:52:36.629 --> 01:52:36.639 align:start position:0%
my drainage it's tough for me to wear a
 
01:52:38.470 --> 01:52:38.480 align:start position:0%
mask all the time
 
01:52:40.629 --> 01:52:40.639 align:start position:0%
okay so uh but there's supposed to be
 
01:52:40.639 --> 01:52:41.589 align:start position:0%
okay so uh but there's supposed to be
shields

01:52:41.589 --> 01:52:41.599 align:start position:0%
shields
 
01:52:43.030 --> 01:52:43.040 align:start position:0%
that they're gonna put you know like
 
01:52:45.510 --> 01:52:45.520 align:start position:0%
plexiglas in between and everything else
 
01:52:48.310 --> 01:52:48.320 align:start position:0%
and then with the air duct system um
 
01:52:49.910 --> 01:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
it's probably going to be pretty safe
 
01:52:52.870 --> 01:52:52.880 align:start position:0%
uh you know in social distancing but
 
01:52:53.669 --> 01:52:53.679 align:start position:0%
like i said
 
01:52:55.189 --> 01:52:55.199 align:start position:0%
you're not going to see me with a mask
 
01:52:57.510 --> 01:52:57.520 align:start position:0%
all the time because i just can't do it
 
01:52:59.669 --> 01:52:59.679 align:start position:0%
okay but in general they will be
 
01:53:02.310 --> 01:53:02.320 align:start position:0%
required but in general yes
 
01:53:04.870 --> 01:53:04.880 align:start position:0%
that's been a medical reason but yes
 
01:53:04.880 --> 01:53:05.750 align:start position:0%
that's been a medical reason but yes
okay

01:53:05.750 --> 01:53:05.760 align:start position:0%

scheduling and once i
 
01:54:06.870 --> 01:54:06.880 align:start position:0%
once i find out the dates that we're
 
01:54:08.709 --> 01:54:08.719 align:start position:0%
going to have the hearings of when
 
01:54:10.950 --> 01:54:10.960 align:start position:0%
that we're going to be scheduled in
 
01:54:12.709 --> 01:54:12.719 align:start position:0%
certain room with a room number
 
01:54:14.149 --> 01:54:14.159 align:start position:0%
then i will put that out and let you
 
01:54:15.750 --> 01:54:15.760 align:start position:0%
know what's going on i will try to keep
 
01:54:17.030 --> 01:54:17.040 align:start position:0%

as what i know i want you to know okay
 
01:54:20.159 --> 01:54:20.629 align:start position:0%
as what i know i want you to know okay
so

01:54:20.629 --> 01:54:20.639 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:54:23.030 --> 01:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
um as i get the information i will put
 
01:54:24.629 --> 01:54:24.639 align:start position:0%
it out to you all
 
01:54:27.030 --> 01:54:27.040 align:start position:0%
and then hopefully uh we can get this
 
01:54:29.109 --> 01:54:29.119 align:start position:0%
done but i can guarantee you now one of
 
01:54:30.470 --> 01:54:30.480 align:start position:0%
the benefits of being on state and
 
01:54:32.870 --> 01:54:32.880 align:start position:0%
federal asian veterans affairs
 
01:54:36.310 --> 01:54:36.320 align:start position:0%
is like normally we get 15 to 20 bills
 
01:54:39.189 --> 01:54:39.199 align:start position:0%
the most i have esteem was 30. uh with
 
01:54:41.189 --> 01:54:41.199 align:start position:0%
only nine bills right now
 
01:54:42.790 --> 01:54:42.800 align:start position:0%
that gives each and every one of you an
 
01:54:44.629 --> 01:54:44.639 align:start position:0%
opportunity to help out on other
 
01:54:44.639 --> 01:54:45.990 align:start position:0%
opportunity to help out on other
committees

01:54:45.990 --> 01:54:46.000 align:start position:0%
committees
 
01:54:47.430 --> 01:54:47.440 align:start position:0%
you know which makes a difference like
 
01:54:49.030 --> 01:54:49.040 align:start position:0%
me i'm involved in a lot of bills not
 
01:54:50.709 --> 01:54:50.719 align:start position:0%
just veterans
 
01:54:53.910 --> 01:54:53.920 align:start position:0%
okay uh so you know this makes life a
 
01:54:55.109 --> 01:54:55.119 align:start position:0%
lot easier there
 
01:54:56.790 --> 01:54:56.800 align:start position:0%
i wish we had more lead pieces of
 
01:54:56.800 --> 01:54:58.229 align:start position:0%
i wish we had more lead pieces of
legislation

01:54:58.229 --> 01:54:58.239 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:55:00.070 --> 01:55:00.080 align:start position:0%
i wish we had more veterans bills than
 
01:55:02.229 --> 01:55:02.239 align:start position:0%
resolutions because then we can all
 
01:55:04.390 --> 01:55:04.400 align:start position:0%
hang out and be nice to each other you
 
01:55:06.870 --> 01:55:06.880 align:start position:0%

know it's just when the resolutions come
forward
