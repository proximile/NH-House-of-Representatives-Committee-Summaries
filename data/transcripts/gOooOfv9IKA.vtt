00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:12.320 align:start position:0%
um we'll get started
 
00:14:15.389 --> 00:14:15.399 align:start position:0%
um uh yesterday worked really good for
 
00:14:18.269 --> 00:14:18.279 align:start position:0%
me to find out which bills people care
 
00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:21.240 align:start position:0%
about and then we could talk about them
 
00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
um so just for the audience but most of
 
00:14:26.749 --> 00:14:26.759 align:start position:0%
them everybody was here yesterday but
 
00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:29.600 align:start position:0%
that um every bill
 
00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:31.880 align:start position:0%
is going the the motion is either
 
00:14:33.829 --> 00:14:33.839 align:start position:0%
recommended or not recommended for
 
00:14:37.069 --> 00:14:37.079 align:start position:0%
future legislation but they took away
 
00:14:39.269 --> 00:14:39.279 align:start position:0%
the recommended with Amendment we don't
 
00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:42.560 align:start position:0%
have that option anymore so therefore um
 
00:14:44.629 --> 00:14:44.639 align:start position:0%
every bill has to be that we have right
 
00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:47.000 align:start position:0%
now has to be perfect ready for prime
 
00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:49.360 align:start position:0%
time for us to recommend for future
 
00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
legislation which of course none of them
 
00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:53.480 align:start position:0%
would be that's why they were intered
 
00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:56.480 align:start position:0%
them studied in the first place so um
 
00:14:58.350 --> 00:14:58.360 align:start position:0%
what we are going to say and I do want
 
00:15:00.389 --> 00:15:00.399 align:start position:0%
to do as a chairman of this committee is
 
00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:02.680 align:start position:0%
that these are some issues that we need
 
00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:04.720 align:start position:0%
to drill down we need to understand more
 
00:15:07.749 --> 00:15:07.759 align:start position:0%
we need to do more homework on and so
 
00:15:10.069 --> 00:15:10.079 align:start position:0%
that we will have subcommittees and I'm
 
00:15:12.629 --> 00:15:12.639 align:start position:0%
going to tell you right now even before
 
00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:15.320 align:start position:0%
we talk about anything that Senate Bill
 
00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:16.550 align:start position:0%
we talk about anything that Senate Bill

353 relative to the autism spectrum and
 
00:15:25.389 --> 00:15:25.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:28.480 align:start position:0%
1571 uh the glucose are two bills that
 
00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:30.040 align:start position:0%
we are definitely going to be doing
 
00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
subcommittees going forward on so the
 
00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:33.680 align:start position:0%
only thing we'll be discussing today is
 
00:15:34.949 --> 00:15:34.959 align:start position:0%

00:15:38.829 --> 00:15:38.839 align:start position:0%

00:17:34.750 --> 00:17:34.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to comment I know the bill was
 
00:17:36.669 --> 00:17:36.679 align:start position:0%
sent to interim study and in the the
 
00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:41.880 align:start position:0%
final session before um that vote uh uh
 
00:17:43.950 --> 00:17:43.960 align:start position:0%
Chief armaganian and the the the
 
00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:47.600 align:start position:0%
chairman of uh the State Liquor
 
00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:50.320 align:start position:0%
Commission basically agreed to create a
 
00:17:54.549 --> 00:17:54.559 align:start position:0%
voluntarily create a um a video to run
 
00:17:56.470 --> 00:17:56.480 align:start position:0%
in all of the state liquor stores on a
 
00:17:59.870 --> 00:17:59.880 align:start position:0%
on a loop um and committed to doing that
 
00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:04.120 align:start position:0%
within six months and that uh has come
 
00:18:09.669 --> 00:18:09.679 align:start position:0%
to pass um it was uh it was I think a a
 
00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:12.840 align:start position:0%
great outcome for for the bill that I
 
00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:14.240 align:start position:0%
had submitted even though it wasn't the
 
00:18:16.510 --> 00:18:16.520 align:start position:0%
outcome that I had uh intended in the
 
00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:19.280 align:start position:0%
legislation so I wanted to make sure it
 
00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:23.440 align:start position:0%
was clear that this I see um and and and
 
00:18:25.669 --> 00:18:25.679 align:start position:0%
uh to commend chairman hunt he original
 
00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:27.400 align:start position:0%
his original reaction to me when we
 
00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:29.320 align:start position:0%
first discussed this was love to do this
 
00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:32.960 align:start position:0%
without legislation um and so something
 
00:18:34.909 --> 00:18:34.919 align:start position:0%
significant happened without legislation
 
00:18:37.669 --> 00:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
so um thanks for sort of sparking that
 
00:18:39.909 --> 00:18:39.919 align:start position:0%
um you know the video that was created
 
00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:42.320 align:start position:0%
was was I think quite good it was
 
00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:44.640 align:start position:0%
empowering it was hopeful it was
 
00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:47.600 align:start position:0%
non-stigmatizing it was action oriented
 
00:18:49.470 --> 00:18:49.480 align:start position:0%
um you know I hope I hope it makes a
 
00:18:50.789 --> 00:18:50.799 align:start position:0%
difference and I I just wanted to say
 
00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:52.440 align:start position:0%
the the best part of that video for me
 
00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:55.200 align:start position:0%
is the last line of that video which
 
00:18:57.190 --> 00:18:57.200 align:start position:0%
says this message brought to you by the
 
00:18:59.390 --> 00:18:59.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire State Liquor Commission
 
00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:01.320 align:start position:0%
you know it's a mission it's a it's a
 
00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:03.720 align:start position:0%
message about seeking help and the
 
00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
availability of help coming directly
 
00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:08.520 align:start position:0%
paired from the groups that that uh from
 
00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:10.360 align:start position:0%
from the the agency within the state
 
00:19:12.029 --> 00:19:12.039 align:start position:0%
that distributes liquor and I feel like
 
00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
both of those um phenomenon the distri
 
00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:18.320 align:start position:0%
the the use of of alcohol in our society
 
00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:20.400 align:start position:0%
and the inevitable problems that a small
 
00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:22.880 align:start position:0%
portion of people have with alcohol you
 
00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:25.200 align:start position:0%
know are really inextricably paired
 
00:19:26.830 --> 00:19:26.840 align:start position:0%
together and I love I love seeing that
 
00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:29.880 align:start position:0%
we are for the first time time sort of
 
00:19:32.029 --> 00:19:32.039 align:start position:0%
finding ways to use our state's
 
00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:34.360 align:start position:0%
connection directly with the people who
 
00:19:36.669 --> 00:19:36.679 align:start position:0%
you know would be coming in possibly on
 
00:19:39.669 --> 00:19:39.679 align:start position:0%
the most frequent basis to to um you
 
00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:42.760 align:start position:0%
know to make sure that they know um that
 
00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:45.360 align:start position:0%
help is available and where to get it um
 
00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:47.440 align:start position:0%
you know I I I will end with saying I
 
00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
hope it's a first step um
 
00:19:52.390 --> 00:19:52.400 align:start position:0%
because I feel like there's there's a
 
00:19:54.270 --> 00:19:54.280 align:start position:0%
great opportunity you know there there's
 
00:19:56.230 --> 00:19:56.240 align:start position:0%
many people who work trying to Market in
 
00:19:58.710 --> 00:19:58.720 align:start position:0%
general these Concepts to the public
 
00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:00.400 align:start position:0%
trying to find the people who need them
 
00:20:01.990 --> 00:20:02.000 align:start position:0%
when we have this opportunity of folks
 
00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:04.760 align:start position:0%
coming through the door um of state
 
00:20:06.669 --> 00:20:06.679 align:start position:0%
liquor stores on a routine basis and
 
00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:08.240 align:start position:0%
that's probably the vast majority of
 
00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:11.200 align:start position:0%
those that need to be reached um you
 
00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
know i' I'd love to think that there
 
00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:14.720 align:start position:0%
could be more obviously the bill that I
 
00:20:17.710 --> 00:20:17.720 align:start position:0%
brought forward had the concept of
 
00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:19.720 align:start position:0%
something that people take out of the
 
00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
store you know be it on the back of
 
00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
receipts or or many of the ideas that
 
00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:25.840 align:start position:0%
sort of were floated on a very lowc cost
 
00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:29.320 align:start position:0%
low um effort basis just to make sure
 
00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:31.280 align:start position:0%
that it's not just those 30 seconds
 
00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:33.760 align:start position:0%
while that person you know is in the
 
00:20:35.669 --> 00:20:35.679 align:start position:0%
store for uh you know to purchase
 
00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:37.320 align:start position:0%
something but that something will go
 
00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:39.760 align:start position:0%
home and even if it gets thrown away a
 
00:20:43.029 --> 00:20:43.039 align:start position:0%
100 200 times maybe one day they will
 
00:20:46.789 --> 00:20:46.799 align:start position:0%
see it pick it up you know think about
 
00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:48.880 align:start position:0%
these these Quest you know these issues
 
00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:50.840 align:start position:0%
and and and take action because re
 
00:20:52.510 --> 00:20:52.520 align:start position:0%
really that's the goal for me is you
 
00:20:54.350 --> 00:20:54.360 align:start position:0%
know getting people to recognize the
 
00:20:56.950 --> 00:20:56.960 align:start position:0%
problem and and Avail themselves of the
 
00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
existing resources um again I think it
 
00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:02.840 align:start position:0%
you know as was discussed very low cost
 
00:21:05.630 --> 00:21:05.640 align:start position:0%
um to to the state to implement some of
 
00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:07.320 align:start position:0%
these things and and doesn't even
 
00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:09.320 align:start position:0%
require sort of an active role of anyone
 
00:21:11.630 --> 00:21:11.640 align:start position:0%
within the liquor stores to to achieve
 
00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
so I'm hoping that there could be a way
 
00:21:17.549 --> 00:21:17.559 align:start position:0%
forward for this um you know and again
 
00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:20.240 align:start position:0%
unclear uh still to this day what does
 
00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:22.640 align:start position:0%
and doesn't require legislation how much
 
00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:24.880 align:start position:0%
needs to be done by authorization how
 
00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:27.960 align:start position:0%
much can be done voluntarily how to lock
 
00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
in these Concepts I know it's funded by
 
00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:32.760 align:start position:0%
a grant from outside the state currently
 
00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
love to see what's been achieved sort of
 
00:21:38.830 --> 00:21:38.840 align:start position:0%
uh you know be become part of the
 
00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:40.760 align:start position:0%
operating standard operating procedure
 
00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:42.520 align:start position:0%
so that that's that's my thought I'm
 
00:21:44.669 --> 00:21:44.679 align:start position:0%
again very grateful for what happened
 
00:21:47.710 --> 00:21:47.720 align:start position:0%
and hopeful that uh it's the beginning
 
00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:50.840 align:start position:0%
of you know a new way forward where you
 
00:21:52.470 --> 00:21:52.480 align:start position:0%
know I'd love to see our state be sort
 
00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:54.640 align:start position:0%
of recognized as as one of the states
 
00:21:57.830 --> 00:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
that is most proactive and most um on
 
00:21:59.029 --> 00:21:59.039 align:start position:0%
top of this
 
00:22:01.669 --> 00:22:01.679 align:start position:0%
connection between between alcohol and
 
00:22:03.870 --> 00:22:03.880 align:start position:0%
um and the inevitable issues so that's
 
00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
that's my thoughts I'm glad to answer
 
00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:08.600 align:start position:0%
anything if anyone has has a question I
 
00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
don't know if that's appropriate y I'd
 
00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:13.720 align:start position:0%
like to add uh thank you very much
 
00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
representative I'd like to add that um I
 
00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:18.320 align:start position:0%
haven't I haven't seen the video in any
 
00:22:21.269 --> 00:22:21.279 align:start position:0%
of the stores at any time but I do hear
 
00:22:24.789 --> 00:22:24.799 align:start position:0%
a a public service announcement um on
 
00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:26.840 align:start position:0%
you know on the on radio playing in you
 
00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:28.200 align:start position:0%
know in the liquor stores and I think
 
00:22:29.029 --> 00:22:29.039 align:start position:0%
that is
 
00:22:31.549 --> 00:22:31.559 align:start position:0%
more effective than the video because
 
00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
you hear it while you're in the store
 
00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:36.480 align:start position:0%
and you're not standing in front of a
 
00:22:39.430 --> 00:22:39.440 align:start position:0%
screen so kudos to the uh Liquor
 
00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:42.080 align:start position:0%
Commission for doing that as well yep
 
00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:44.120 align:start position:0%
and I I I visited the store with several
 
00:22:46.190 --> 00:22:46.200 align:start position:0%
people who are are very interested in
 
00:22:47.909 --> 00:22:47.919 align:start position:0%
this and and the reaction of all of them
 
00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:50.000 align:start position:0%
was that that it's very good you know
 
00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:52.200 align:start position:0%
again I think the most difficult part is
 
00:22:54.909 --> 00:22:54.919 align:start position:0%
you know you're it's a limited contact
 
00:22:57.269 --> 00:22:57.279 align:start position:0%
with with someone you know at a time
 
00:22:59.390 --> 00:22:59.400 align:start position:0%
when they have another agenda which is
 
00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:01.360 align:start position:0%
to purchase something you know and I'd
 
00:23:02.669 --> 00:23:02.679 align:start position:0%
love to find a way to extend that but
 
00:23:04.190 --> 00:23:04.200 align:start position:0%
that that's a great thought thank you
 
00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:05.549 align:start position:0%
that that's a great thought thank you
for

00:23:05.549 --> 00:23:05.559 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:23:09.230 --> 00:23:09.240 align:start position:0%
that representative Gibbs thank you and
 
00:23:12.909 --> 00:23:12.919 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming in this morning um
 
00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:18.440 align:start position:0%
my question uh is about the usefulness
 
00:23:22.669 --> 00:23:22.679 align:start position:0%
of putting something on the receipts uh
 
00:23:24.269 --> 00:23:24.279 align:start position:0%
when people buy liquor in the state
 
00:23:25.909 --> 00:23:25.919 align:start position:0%
liquor stores I know that was a major
 
00:23:27.710 --> 00:23:27.720 align:start position:0%
part of the discussion during the
 
00:23:29.909 --> 00:23:29.919 align:start position:0%
original hearing on the bill whether it
 
00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:31.760 align:start position:0%
was practical how much it would cost and
 
00:23:36.549 --> 00:23:36.559 align:start position:0%
so forth um but my question is based on
 
00:23:38.190 --> 00:23:38.200 align:start position:0%
the fact that I've been in a state
 
00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:41.840 align:start position:0%
liquor store a couple of times um fairly
 
00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:43.350 align:start position:0%
liquor store a couple of times um fairly
recently

00:23:43.350 --> 00:23:43.360 align:start position:0%
recently
 
00:23:48.149 --> 00:23:48.159 align:start position:0%
and uh sometimes the cashier says do you
 
00:23:50.269 --> 00:23:50.279 align:start position:0%
want the receipt and a lot of the time I
 
00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:52.320 align:start position:0%
just say no so I don't even see the
 
00:23:54.870 --> 00:23:54.880 align:start position:0%
receipt at all and even when I take the
 
00:23:57.230 --> 00:23:57.240 align:start position:0%
receipt I have to tell you it's that
 
00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
long and so far as I can recall I have
 
00:24:04.909 --> 00:24:04.919 align:start position:0%
never ever actually looked at it um and
 
00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:07.360 align:start position:0%
I imagine that's true for most people so
 
00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:09.520 align:start position:0%
my question is do you still think that
 
00:24:11.029 --> 00:24:11.039 align:start position:0%
putting something on the receipt would
 
00:24:11.039 --> 00:24:12.390 align:start position:0%
putting something on the receipt would
be

00:24:12.390 --> 00:24:12.400 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:24:15.549 --> 00:24:15.559 align:start position:0%
useful thank thanks as that's a great
 
00:24:18.390 --> 00:24:18.400 align:start position:0%
thought um the way I originally drafted
 
00:24:20.990 --> 00:24:21.000 align:start position:0%
this bill it left it quite open in terms
 
00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
of how the liquor stores would
 
00:24:24.750 --> 00:24:24.760 align:start position:0%
distribute this information and and the
 
00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:27.480 align:start position:0%
information would include in my in in my
 
00:24:30.590 --> 00:24:30.600 align:start position:0%
vision of that two parts one is a Ser a
 
00:24:32.510 --> 00:24:32.520 align:start position:0%
short series of questions to help you
 
00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:34.480 align:start position:0%
consider whether or not you are someone
 
00:24:37.710 --> 00:24:37.720 align:start position:0%
who might need help um that's always
 
00:24:39.549 --> 00:24:39.559 align:start position:0%
step one in someone seeking help is
 
00:24:41.470 --> 00:24:41.480 align:start position:0%
recognizing it and then the second part
 
00:24:43.549 --> 00:24:43.559 align:start position:0%
was the referral system you know at the
 
00:24:45.430 --> 00:24:45.440 align:start position:0%
time it was up and air between 988 and
 
00:24:49.549 --> 00:24:49.559 align:start position:0%
211 but either of those um you know
 
00:24:51.510 --> 00:24:51.520 align:start position:0%
mechanisms already exist and the
 
00:24:53.669 --> 00:24:53.679 align:start position:0%
programs behind it or exist the idea
 
00:24:55.549 --> 00:24:55.559 align:start position:0%
behind something like receipt and I
 
00:24:57.950 --> 00:24:57.960 align:start position:0%
totally agree every time I go to CVS I I
 
00:25:01.269 --> 00:25:01.279 align:start position:0%
leave with you know six feet of paper um
 
00:25:04.350 --> 00:25:04.360 align:start position:0%
is that the people who most need this uh
 
00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:06.360 align:start position:0%
are probably coming in on a very
 
00:25:08.909 --> 00:25:08.919 align:start position:0%
frequent basis you know so the this
 
00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:10.880 align:start position:0%
won't be one receipt it will be many
 
00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
many receipts um and it might not be the
 
00:25:15.710 --> 00:25:15.720 align:start position:0%
person who purchases it it might be a
 
00:25:17.909 --> 00:25:17.919 align:start position:0%
family member or a friend who picks that
 
00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:21.200 align:start position:0%
up and says hey you know this this is
 
00:25:23.470 --> 00:25:23.480 align:start position:0%
something that sounds like you the the
 
00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:25.240 align:start position:0%
other question is if they don't take the
 
00:25:29.909 --> 00:25:29.919 align:start position:0%
receipt um you know
 
00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:31.760 align:start position:0%
there's electronic receipts if they if
 
00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:33.120 align:start position:0%
if they're distributed that way if
 
00:25:35.549 --> 00:25:35.559 align:start position:0%
there's not electronic receipts you know
 
00:25:37.590 --> 00:25:37.600 align:start position:0%
so be it um you know I know there was
 
00:25:39.470 --> 00:25:39.480 align:start position:0%
some resistance to the idea of including
 
00:25:41.789 --> 00:25:41.799 align:start position:0%
some sort of a card um there's a couple
 
00:25:43.630 --> 00:25:43.640 align:start position:0%
other folks here who might have some
 
00:25:45.630 --> 00:25:45.640 align:start position:0%
ideas of other materials that are that
 
00:25:48.909 --> 00:25:48.919 align:start position:0%
are very low impact or low low cost that
 
00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
already exist that could be that could
 
00:25:53.430 --> 00:25:53.440 align:start position:0%
be utilized to to further lessen the
 
00:25:55.669 --> 00:25:55.679 align:start position:0%
burden on on the state the idea is just
 
00:25:58.549 --> 00:25:58.559 align:start position:0%
to put something in someone's hand that
 
00:26:00.510 --> 00:26:00.520 align:start position:0%
you know with repeated messaging and
 
00:26:02.190 --> 00:26:02.200 align:start position:0%
repeated use could could lead them to
 
00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:05.630 align:start position:0%
repeated use could could lead them to
take

00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:05.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:08.149 --> 00:26:08.159 align:start position:0%
action representative M thank you
 
00:26:10.710 --> 00:26:10.720 align:start position:0%
chairman ju just a quick question you is
 
00:26:13.070 --> 00:26:13.080 align:start position:0%
this um video playing in all liquor
 
00:26:14.830 --> 00:26:14.840 align:start position:0%
stores because I've never seen it and
 
00:26:16.350 --> 00:26:16.360 align:start position:0%
maybe I'm just not going into the liquor
 
00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
store enough I I don't know I I won't
 
00:26:23.830 --> 00:26:23.840 align:start position:0%
comment on the second part um but but uh
 
00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:26.600 align:start position:0%
um it is it is playing um on all stores
 
00:26:28.590 --> 00:26:28.600 align:start position:0%
that have screens which is not all
 
00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:31.240 align:start position:0%
stores from what I understand but um in
 
00:26:32.909 --> 00:26:32.919 align:start position:0%
the stores that I've visited there there
 
00:26:35.029 --> 00:26:35.039 align:start position:0%
are multiple screens and it alternates
 
00:26:38.430 --> 00:26:38.440 align:start position:0%
between sort of promotional um roughly
 
00:26:41.389 --> 00:26:41.399 align:start position:0%
30 seconds I can see of promotional um
 
00:26:43.669 --> 00:26:43.679 align:start position:0%
content around sales or other other
 
00:26:45.470 --> 00:26:45.480 align:start position:0%
items and then it alternates back and
 
00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:48.640 align:start position:0%
forth to this 30- second um video and
 
00:26:50.590 --> 00:26:50.600 align:start position:0%
the video does not call out in any way
 
00:26:53.149 --> 00:26:53.159 align:start position:0%
alcohol specifically it's about you know
 
00:26:54.950 --> 00:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
reaching out for help in in in the
 
00:26:58.350 --> 00:26:58.360 align:start position:0%
broader sense um and again I I think
 
00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:00.720 align:start position:0%
that maybe why I'm I'm speaking here is
 
00:27:02.149 --> 00:27:02.159 align:start position:0%
that you know I would I would love to
 
00:27:05.350 --> 00:27:05.360 align:start position:0%
find a way that that content could could
 
00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:07.600 align:start position:0%
stay with the customer as they as they
 
00:27:10.230 --> 00:27:10.240 align:start position:0%
leave in a way that gives them other
 
00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
opportunities to to to
 
00:27:16.590 --> 00:27:16.600 align:start position:0%
connect representative pusk thank you Mr
 
00:27:18.110 --> 00:27:18.120 align:start position:0%
chair thank you representative for
 
00:27:21.389 --> 00:27:21.399 align:start position:0%
bringing this bill uh I live in Dair we
 
00:27:24.549 --> 00:27:24.559 align:start position:0%
have a new liquor store and uh I took
 
00:27:26.950 --> 00:27:26.960 align:start position:0%
the opportunity a couple of weeks ago to
 
00:27:29.470 --> 00:27:29.480 align:start position:0%
spend some time just viewing what's
 
00:27:33.190 --> 00:27:33.200 align:start position:0%
going on uh I saw the video I was there
 
00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
for like 15 20 minutes I saw the video
 
00:27:38.830 --> 00:27:38.840 align:start position:0%
twice M uh and the
 
00:27:41.909 --> 00:27:41.919 align:start position:0%
audio will be great because it kind of
 
00:27:44.350 --> 00:27:44.360 align:start position:0%
works into your subconscious whether you
 
00:27:46.750 --> 00:27:46.760 align:start position:0%
know it or not you're listening to it
 
00:27:49.070 --> 00:27:49.080 align:start position:0%
and I counted the number of people at
 
00:27:53.710 --> 00:27:53.720 align:start position:0%
two registers that took receipts over 15
 
00:27:56.509 --> 00:27:56.519 align:start position:0%
minutes it's three people Y and
 
00:27:58.389 --> 00:27:58.399 align:start position:0%
everybody was offered them nobody told
 
00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:00.480 align:start position:0%
accept three people I always take mine
 
00:28:03.470 --> 00:28:03.480 align:start position:0%
my wife will kill me if I don't uh but
 
00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:06.600 align:start position:0%
what you brought forward I believe is
 
00:28:10.750 --> 00:28:10.760 align:start position:0%
working uh from my point of view and uh
 
00:28:12.990 --> 00:28:13.000 align:start position:0%
with the Liquor Commission and I think
 
00:28:14.789 --> 00:28:14.799 align:start position:0%
new Futures might have had a little
 
00:28:18.149 --> 00:28:18.159 align:start position:0%
piece of it uh thank you very much would
 
00:28:20.789 --> 00:28:20.799 align:start position:0%
you believe and thank thank you for
 
00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:22.720 align:start position:0%
offering the receipt uh pre-printed
 
00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:24.600 align:start position:0%
receipt idea as a would you believe
 
00:28:26.990 --> 00:28:27.000 align:start position:0%
initially on on this um again I'm I'm
 
00:28:29.230 --> 00:28:29.240 align:start position:0%
totally agnostic to how this content
 
00:28:32.870 --> 00:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
gets distributed um you know I I think
 
00:28:35.710 --> 00:28:35.720 align:start position:0%
the receipts were an idea they may be an
 
00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:38.760 align:start position:0%
idea of a bygone era um you know again
 
00:28:40.909 --> 00:28:40.919 align:start position:0%
hopeful hopefully we can we can find
 
00:28:43.470 --> 00:28:43.480 align:start position:0%
ways to further deepen this kind of
 
00:28:46.269 --> 00:28:46.279 align:start position:0%
collaboration follow up sure just for a
 
00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:49.200 align:start position:0%
minute thir question thank you Mr and if
 
00:28:52.870 --> 00:28:52.880 align:start position:0%
you save one life it's worth it thank
 
00:28:56.350 --> 00:28:56.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:59.549 --> 00:28:59.559 align:start position:0%
more okay uh we'll wrap it up I I I
 
00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
guess I only have one comment yes and uh
 
00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
it's related to a different issue which
 
00:29:09.630 --> 00:29:09.640 align:start position:0%
is the marijuana that this is only
 
00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
possible because we have a control state
 
00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:16.600 align:start position:0%
with State liqu Stores also also
 
00:29:18.350 --> 00:29:18.360 align:start position:0%
completely agree it gives us a
 
00:29:21.149 --> 00:29:21.159 align:start position:0%
absolutely unique opportunity to go
 
00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:23.440 align:start position:0%
further than many other states can go in
 
00:29:26.149 --> 00:29:26.159 align:start position:0%
terms of addressing sort of the known
 
00:29:28.870 --> 00:29:28.880 align:start position:0%
consequences of alcohol call for small
 
00:29:31.389 --> 00:29:31.399 align:start position:0%
segment of society that that that
 
00:29:33.710 --> 00:29:33.720 align:start position:0%
experiences difficulty thanks and I
 
00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:34.960 align:start position:0%
there there may be a couple other folks
 
00:29:37.509 --> 00:29:37.519 align:start position:0%
that came today but um if if that's all
 
00:29:39.310 --> 00:29:39.320 align:start position:0%
all right thank you thank you for your
 
00:29:42.870 --> 00:29:42.880 align:start position:0%
time y so is anybody else would like to
 
00:29:46.230 --> 00:29:46.240 align:start position:0%
weigh in and tell how great 1571 turned
 
00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:50.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:54.909 --> 00:29:54.919 align:start position:0%
down since representative pusk mentioned
 
00:29:56.630 --> 00:29:56.640 align:start position:0%
new Futures you probably want to tell us
 
00:29:59.430 --> 00:29:59.440 align:start position:0%
what new futures did for this good
 
00:30:01.549 --> 00:30:01.559 align:start position:0%
morning my name is Kate fry from new F
 
00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
uh new Futures I'm so sorry I'm not in
 
00:30:06.110 --> 00:30:06.120 align:start position:0%
back to school mode I forgot my badge
 
00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:08.640 align:start position:0%
today I'm very sorry about that I'll be
 
00:30:10.389 --> 00:30:10.399 align:start position:0%
very brief I want to thank
 
00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:12.840 align:start position:0%
representative tour for introducing the
 
00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:15.760 align:start position:0%
legislation and for uh this committee to
 
00:30:18.190 --> 00:30:18.200 align:start position:0%
helping find uh a non-legislative
 
00:30:21.230 --> 00:30:21.240 align:start position:0%
solution and particularly for the Liquor
 
00:30:23.549 --> 00:30:23.559 align:start position:0%
Commission I have to say new Futures uh
 
00:30:25.830 --> 00:30:25.840 align:start position:0%
didn't have as big a role as the Liquor
 
00:30:27.110 --> 00:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
Commission and the Department of Health
 
00:30:29.029 --> 00:30:29.039 align:start position:0%
and Human Services is incorporating the
 
00:30:31.230 --> 00:30:31.240 align:start position:0%
strong as Granite campaign so that we
 
00:30:33.230 --> 00:30:33.240 align:start position:0%
know it's evidence-based and that the
 
00:30:36.029 --> 00:30:36.039 align:start position:0%
messaging is spot on my only request
 
00:30:37.830 --> 00:30:37.840 align:start position:0%
down the line and it doesn't necessarily
 
00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
have to be legislation is that we do
 
00:30:41.710 --> 00:30:41.720 align:start position:0%
think about the sustainability of this
 
00:30:43.310 --> 00:30:43.320 align:start position:0%
The Liquor Commission was very grateful
 
00:30:45.750 --> 00:30:45.760 align:start position:0%
to offer this uh to do this but we don't
 
00:30:48.990 --> 00:30:49.000 align:start position:0%
know if that will be forever or so I I
 
00:30:50.509 --> 00:30:50.519 align:start position:0%
think it'd be helpful to see the
 
00:30:52.430 --> 00:30:52.440 align:start position:0%
effectiveness and consider this in
 
00:30:58.029 --> 00:30:58.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:59.789 --> 00:30:59.799 align:start position:0%
you could take that up with Finance when
 
00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:02.760 align:start position:0%
they do their budget yeah I I if
 
00:31:04.590 --> 00:31:04.600 align:start position:0%
anything I would say we want to expand
 
00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:07.840 align:start position:0%
it to include 988 make sure have 988 is
 
00:31:10.669 --> 00:31:10.679 align:start position:0%
being presented so I will I will pass
 
00:31:14.669 --> 00:31:14.679 align:start position:0%
that on to the commission so uh we G
 
00:31:17.669 --> 00:31:17.679 align:start position:0%
make a motion no we're gonna we'll take
 
00:31:19.669 --> 00:31:19.679 align:start position:0%
everything on one day when we bam them
 
00:31:23.549 --> 00:31:23.559 align:start position:0%
all out some of the time okay that's it

00:31:43.509 --> 00:31:43.519 align:start position:0%
subcommittee for these two bills I
 
00:31:45.029 --> 00:31:45.039 align:start position:0%
assume you want to be on the
 
00:31:48.350 --> 00:31:48.360 align:start position:0%

00:31:51.909 --> 00:31:51.919 align:start position:0%
okay yes you put your mic on please
 
00:31:53.470 --> 00:31:53.480 align:start position:0%
comment I want to make a I want to make
 
00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:54.350 align:start position:0%
comment I want to make a I want to make
a

00:31:54.350 --> 00:31:54.360 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:31:57.149 --> 00:31:57.159 align:start position:0%
comment uh in researching in doing some
 
00:31:59.230 --> 00:31:59.240 align:start position:0%
research on the situation with Down
 
00:32:01.470 --> 00:32:01.480 align:start position:0%
syndrome kids I went to the National
 
00:32:05.029 --> 00:32:05.039 align:start position:0%
Institutes of Health and also the CDC
 
00:32:07.710 --> 00:32:07.720 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire has 1800 a population
 
00:32:10.190 --> 00:32:10.200 align:start position:0%
of 1,800 people with Down Syndrome
 
00:32:12.990 --> 00:32:13.000 align:start position:0%
that's the total population we get about
 
00:32:15.990 --> 00:32:16.000 align:start position:0%
20 Down syndrome kids a
 
00:32:18.909 --> 00:32:18.919 align:start position:0%
year that's the total we are not talking
 
00:32:22.149 --> 00:32:22.159 align:start position:0%
about a huge number of
 
00:32:25.230 --> 00:32:25.240 align:start position:0%
people of the kids that have Downs
 
00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:26.720 align:start position:0%
according to the National Institutes of
 
00:32:32.149 --> 00:32:32.159 align:start position:0%
Health 16% % have also a a co-diagnosis
 
00:32:32.159 --> 00:32:33.350 align:start position:0%
Health 16% % have also a a co-diagnosis
of

00:32:33.350 --> 00:32:33.360 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
autism that's 16% another 16% have
 
00:32:40.629 --> 00:32:40.639 align:start position:0%
autism like symptoms in other words they
 
00:32:42.509 --> 00:32:42.519 align:start position:0%
have symptoms but they're not severe
 
00:32:45.990 --> 00:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
enough to be considered
 
00:32:48.870 --> 00:32:48.880 align:start position:0%
autistic those are the kids that we
 
00:32:50.389 --> 00:32:50.399 align:start position:0%
having that are that were having a
 
00:32:53.710 --> 00:32:53.720 align:start position:0%
problem and also other behavioral issues
 
00:32:56.870 --> 00:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
the other problem that I saw so the rest
 
00:32:59.110 --> 00:32:59.120 align:start position:0%
of the Down Syndrome population of young
 
00:33:01.149 --> 00:33:01.159 align:start position:0%
people and and this adaptive Behavior
 
00:33:02.950 --> 00:33:02.960 align:start position:0%
kind of things only work for young
 
00:33:04.789 --> 00:33:04.799 align:start position:0%
people it doesn't work for older people
 
00:33:06.549 --> 00:33:06.559 align:start position:0%
when we get I mean I can't picture
 
00:33:08.950 --> 00:33:08.960 align:start position:0%
somebody changing me at all it's too
 
00:33:11.509 --> 00:33:11.519 align:start position:0%
late for me but you know it only works
 
00:33:14.110 --> 00:33:14.120 align:start position:0%
for young people so it's not we're not
 
00:33:18.269 --> 00:33:18.279 align:start position:0%
talking about a large population and I
 
00:33:21.310 --> 00:33:21.320 align:start position:0%
think it is our responsibility to do
 
00:33:24.509 --> 00:33:24.519 align:start position:0%
something about these kids and help them
 
00:33:26.950 --> 00:33:26.960 align:start position:0%
as best we can because if we don't help
 
00:33:28.509 --> 00:33:28.519 align:start position:0%
them now
 
00:33:30.430 --> 00:33:30.440 align:start position:0%
when they become adults and they have
 
00:33:33.029 --> 00:33:33.039 align:start position:0%
not received the proper training or
 
00:33:35.549 --> 00:33:35.559 align:start position:0%
anything we can do then we're stuck with
 
00:33:38.629 --> 00:33:38.639 align:start position:0%
a much worse problem and so I think it's
 
00:33:40.509 --> 00:33:40.519 align:start position:0%
it's very important that we extend this
 
00:33:42.909 --> 00:33:42.919 align:start position:0%
legislation eventually and get this
 
00:33:44.669 --> 00:33:44.679 align:start position:0%
covered and the other thing I I've
 
00:33:49.269 --> 00:33:49.279 align:start position:0%
spoken to uh the medical director of uh
 
00:33:53.549 --> 00:33:53.559 align:start position:0%
Anthem and and the application of
 
00:33:55.549 --> 00:33:55.559 align:start position:0%
whether or not there's efficacy re
 
00:33:57.990 --> 00:33:58.000 align:start position:0%
evolving this kind of Behavioral analys
 
00:34:01.629 --> 00:34:01.639 align:start position:0%
say it hasn't been updated in quite some
 
00:34:01.639 --> 00:34:04.149 align:start position:0%
say it hasn't been updated in quite some
time

00:34:04.149 --> 00:34:04.159 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:34:07.549 --> 00:34:07.559 align:start position:0%
and so I'm I'm not clear on how valid
 
00:34:10.389 --> 00:34:10.399 align:start position:0%
that is you know so and kids are being
 
00:34:12.829 --> 00:34:12.839 align:start position:0%
turned away and massach and this is
 
00:34:14.589 --> 00:34:14.599 align:start position:0%
another Point massachusett has done a
 
00:34:16.349 --> 00:34:16.359 align:start position:0%
study because they're they're working on
 
00:34:18.710 --> 00:34:18.720 align:start position:0%
a law very similar to ours and it comes
 
00:34:20.470 --> 00:34:20.480 align:start position:0%
out to about 18
 
00:34:23.389 --> 00:34:23.399 align:start position:0%
cents so for 18
 
00:34:27.069 --> 00:34:27.079 align:start position:0%
cents it's a very good bang for the buck
 
00:34:28.669 --> 00:34:28.679 align:start position:0%
so I'm hoping that we can put together
 
00:34:30.389 --> 00:34:30.399 align:start position:0%
some kind of legislation that works when
 
00:34:32.750 --> 00:34:32.760 align:start position:0%
you say turned away who who's turning
 
00:34:34.589 --> 00:34:34.599 align:start position:0%
away I we have someone here who can talk
 
00:34:36.669 --> 00:34:36.679 align:start position:0%
about that there are there are kids who
 
00:34:38.869 --> 00:34:38.879 align:start position:0%
are not being covered under uh their
 
00:34:40.589 --> 00:34:40.599 align:start position:0%
insurance is not covered they applied
 
00:34:42.190 --> 00:34:42.200 align:start position:0%
for the insurance the insurance didn't
 
00:34:46.030 --> 00:34:46.040 align:start position:0%
cover it got it okay and as I say if you
 
00:34:47.550 --> 00:34:47.560 align:start position:0%
don't cover them now we're going to have
 
00:34:50.069 --> 00:34:50.079 align:start position:0%
a much worse problem later because the
 
00:34:52.510 --> 00:34:52.520 align:start position:0%
kids aren't going to get
 
00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:54.030 align:start position:0%
kids aren't going to get
better

00:34:54.030 --> 00:34:54.040 align:start position:0%
better
 
00:34:57.750 --> 00:34:57.760 align:start position:0%
okay all right so we will um I will
 
00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
appoint who else would like to be on the
 
00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:04.990 align:start position:0%
appoint who else would like to be on the
subcommittee

00:35:04.990 --> 00:35:05.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:12.190 --> 00:35:12.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:21.630 --> 00:35:21.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:24.829 --> 00:35:24.839 align:start position:0%
else I will be running the subcommittees
 
00:35:28.310 --> 00:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:30.390 --> 00:35:30.400 align:start position:0%
and two it's right now we're right now
 
00:35:33.550 --> 00:35:33.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:35.910 --> 00:35:35.920 align:start position:0%
two uh well I would just have to find
 
00:35:38.589 --> 00:35:38.599 align:start position:0%
another Republican so but you can
 
00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
obviously show up you mean subcommittees
 
00:35:42.750 --> 00:35:42.760 align:start position:0%
does not
 
00:35:45.870 --> 00:35:45.880 align:start position:0%
limit you know you know obviously there
 
00:35:47.390 --> 00:35:47.400 align:start position:0%
will be print in the calendar when you
 
00:35:50.309 --> 00:35:50.319 align:start position:0%
urge everyone to to show up and be
 
00:35:50.319 --> 00:35:53.990 align:start position:0%
urge everyone to to show up and be
informed

00:35:53.990 --> 00:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:56.910 --> 00:35:56.920 align:start position:0%
so Mr chair the other uh the liquor
 
00:35:59.309 --> 00:35:59.319 align:start position:0%
bills that are at the bottom of the list
 
00:36:03.910 --> 00:36:03.920 align:start position:0%
yeah um could we just um what happened
 
00:36:05.829 --> 00:36:05.839 align:start position:0%
to these bills I mean they're interm
 
00:36:07.430 --> 00:36:07.440 align:start position:0%
studies so we no longer need them if
 
00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:09.760 align:start position:0%
we're not discussing them or I I don't
 
00:36:12.710 --> 00:36:12.720 align:start position:0%

00:36:14.030 --> 00:36:14.040 align:start position:0%
was yeah
 
00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:15.910 align:start position:0%
was yeah
right

00:36:15.910 --> 00:36:15.920 align:start position:0%

walz okay so yes we're done with that so
 
00:36:47.630 --> 00:36:47.640 align:start position:0%
now we're just uh going
 
00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:49.270 align:start position:0%
now we're just uh going
through

00:36:49.270 --> 00:36:49.280 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:51.680 align:start position:0%
um okay well the terms of relative
 
00:36:53.230 --> 00:36:53.240 align:start position:0%
oversight Liquor Commission funding and
 
00:36:55.510 --> 00:36:55.520 align:start position:0%
repealing the Liquor Commission fund is
 
00:36:56.870 --> 00:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
no I'm good with that does anybody want
 
00:36:58.309 --> 00:36:58.319 align:start position:0%
to do that
 
00:37:03.030 --> 00:37:03.040 align:start position:0%
okay didn't think so okay um 1582 oh
 
00:37:05.150 --> 00:37:05.160 align:start position:0%
relative to allowing for consumption of
 
00:37:06.910 --> 00:37:06.920 align:start position:0%
alcohol and artist performance areas we
 
00:37:09.109 --> 00:37:09.119 align:start position:0%
did address that in a different build
 
00:37:11.790 --> 00:37:11.800 align:start position:0%
yeah we did address that okay yeah and
 
00:37:13.790 --> 00:37:13.800 align:start position:0%
then uh that was us where we killed we
 
00:37:16.589 --> 00:37:16.599 align:start position:0%
killed several birds with one stone okay
 
00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:19.280 align:start position:0%
and then the labeling of uh
 
00:37:23.829 --> 00:37:23.839 align:start position:0%
THC where the the last one okay um was
 
00:37:25.589 --> 00:37:25.599 align:start position:0%
do we have a similar bill as that Dad
 
00:37:28.109 --> 00:37:28.119 align:start position:0%
Dad got taken care of a different
 
00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:32.240 align:start position:0%
legislation the um it it is labeled now
 
00:37:35.230 --> 00:37:35.240 align:start position:0%
it was it was about the delta8 and Delta
 
00:37:38.589 --> 00:37:38.599 align:start position:0%
9 yeah you know what's did it yeah it
 
00:37:40.470 --> 00:37:40.480 align:start position:0%
got it stuck in they got stuck in in a
 
00:37:42.829 --> 00:37:42.839 align:start position:0%
different Bill and so they are believe
 
00:37:44.910 --> 00:37:44.920 align:start position:0%
you me anything that says Senate bill
 
00:37:48.069 --> 00:37:48.079 align:start position:0%
you know they tenant took care yeah but
 
00:37:54.910 --> 00:37:54.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:58.430 --> 00:37:58.440 align:start position:0%
yes the sunset was appeal exactly that's
 
00:38:01.470 --> 00:38:01.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:06.349 --> 00:38:06.359 align:start position:0%
was and uh then cannabis I just assume
 
00:38:07.710 --> 00:38:07.720 align:start position:0%
there'll be other people putting new
 
00:38:11.910 --> 00:38:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:15.550 --> 00:38:15.560 align:start position:0%
so whether we this committee will will
 
00:38:17.309 --> 00:38:17.319 align:start position:0%
get it anyway
 
00:38:20.230 --> 00:38:20.240 align:start position:0%
so we we'll get it hopefully but you
 
00:38:21.510 --> 00:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
never know they might send it to another
 
00:38:25.990 --> 00:38:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:29.630 --> 00:38:29.640 align:start position:0%

00:38:31.910 --> 00:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
okay is everybody else feel comfortable
 
00:38:34.510 --> 00:38:34.520 align:start position:0%
