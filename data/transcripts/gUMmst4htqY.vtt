i want to speak to you in motion uh yes

well first of all
 
00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:17.360 align:start position:0%
i'd like to thank representative
 
00:08:19.909 --> 00:08:19.919 align:start position:0%
aaron for bringing this bill forward
 
00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
um but you know the more we melt we
 
00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
think about this that there's a this is
 
00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:27.680 align:start position:0%
a major change we're talking about doing
 
00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:28.710 align:start position:0%
a major change we're talking about doing
here

00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:28.720 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:08:30.869 --> 00:08:30.879 align:start position:0%
in changing the percentages that go to
 
00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
the this has to do with the opioid
 
00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
settlement money
 
00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:36.240 align:start position:0%
and that that part of money's growing
 
00:08:38.149 --> 00:08:38.159 align:start position:0%
every week in terms of the settlements
 
00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:40.880 align:start position:0%
that are coming in and
 
00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:43.680 align:start position:0%
i for one wanted actually to see more
 
00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
but after after further discussion with
 
00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:51.910 align:start position:0%
but after after further discussion with
rep

00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
rep
 
00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
a g buffet
 
00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:55.760 align:start position:0%
it's clear that there was a lot that
 
00:08:57.990 --> 00:08:58.000 align:start position:0%
went on behind the scenes to establish
 
00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
the allocations the way they were
 
00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:02.320 align:start position:0%
and i think we need to let those settle
 
00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:03.670 align:start position:0%
and i think we need to let those settle
in

00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:03.680 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:05.120 align:start position:0%
before we start changing the
 
00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
distribution formulas
 
00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:10.240 align:start position:0%
what we just decided uh i i think i
 
00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:11.920 align:start position:0%
think the best thing for us to do so to
 
00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:13.360 align:start position:0%
keep this alive
 
00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
i have no problem changing this down the
 
00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:16.070 align:start position:0%
i have no problem changing this down the
road

00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
road
 
00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:17.030 align:start position:0%
road
uh

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
to to a new formula or at least to
 
00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
recommend a new formula
 
00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:22.640 align:start position:0%
but for now let's let this get off the
 
00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:23.829 align:start position:0%
but for now let's let this get off the
ground

00:09:23.829 --> 00:09:23.839 align:start position:0%
ground
 
00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:26.880 align:start position:0%
um it's not going to be until march the
 
00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:28.640 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
rules are going to be heard on march
 
00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:31.509 align:start position:0%
rules are going to be heard on march
15th

00:09:31.509 --> 00:09:31.519 align:start position:0%
15th
 
00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:32.800 align:start position:0%
and then shortly hopefully shortly
 
00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:34.480 align:start position:0%
thereafter they'll be going to jail car
 
00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:36.080 align:start position:0%
so that we could start spending some of
 
00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:40.320 align:start position:0%
that first 2.7 million at opioid money
 
00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
but since then we've had another
 
00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:44.320 align:start position:0%
settlement for another 115 million then
 
00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:46.320 align:start position:0%
we had another settlement for another 46
 
00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
million and there's others that are
 
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.430 align:start position:0%
million and there's others that are
coming

00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:49.440 align:start position:0%
coming
 
00:09:52.389 --> 00:09:52.399 align:start position:0%
so uh with that we i think it'd be
 
00:09:55.829 --> 00:09:55.839 align:start position:0%
prudent uh to keep this alive by via
 
00:09:57.269 --> 00:09:57.279 align:start position:0%
interim study
 
00:09:59.829 --> 00:09:59.839 align:start position:0%
uh and not not i think we really do need
 
00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:01.680 align:start position:0%
more conversation on this bill before we
 
00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:04.640 align:start position:0%
start tampering with the formula so
 
00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
i hope everybody joins me in an interim
 
00:10:08.389 --> 00:10:08.399 align:start position:0%
study thank you
 
00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:14.480 align:start position:0%
saying none i'm not going to ask the
 
00:10:16.949 --> 00:10:16.959 align:start position:0%

representative romney
 
00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
so everybody knows
 
00:12:25.829 --> 00:12:25.839 align:start position:0%
the senate has five of our bills or four
 
00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:27.440 align:start position:0%
of our bills being
 
00:12:28.949 --> 00:12:28.959 align:start position:0%
heard right now
 
00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
representative lang is over there and
 
00:12:33.269 --> 00:12:33.279 align:start position:0%
representative schaumburger is over
 
00:12:34.389 --> 00:12:34.399 align:start position:0%
there we knew this vote was going to be
 
00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:36.560 align:start position:0%
unanimous that's why we voted without
 
00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:37.430 align:start position:0%
unanimous that's why we voted without
them

00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:39.680 align:start position:0%
i have to go over it about 20 after and
 
00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:41.600 align:start position:0%
then i have to go up i have to go over
 
00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:43.200 align:start position:0%
like 22.
 
00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:45.440 align:start position:0%
so there may be some bumps in this uh
 
00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
process here
 
00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:48.800 align:start position:0%
um because what can i say it was
 
00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:50.800 align:start position:0%
supposed to be nine o'clock
 
00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
and then they change their schedule to
 
00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:55.360 align:start position:0%
10 o'clock and so we've got conflicts
 
00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
some of us have to go defend our bells
 
00:13:04.829 --> 00:13:04.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:20.949 --> 00:14:20.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:20.959 --> 00:14:22.230 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:22.240 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:14:24.069 --> 00:14:24.079 align:start position:0%
we're going to
 
00:14:26.949 --> 00:14:26.959 align:start position:0%
go out of executive session
 
00:14:29.829 --> 00:14:29.839 align:start position:0%
and go into a work session on house bill
 
00:14:29.839 --> 00:14:38.310 align:start position:0%
and go into a work session on house bill
1097

00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:38.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:48.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:01.189 --> 00:15:01.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
an act relative to taxation of income of
 
00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:05.920 align:start position:0%
new hampshire residents
 
00:15:08.069 --> 00:15:08.079 align:start position:0%
when working remotely for an out of
 
00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:09.760 align:start position:0%
state employer
 
00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:19.509 --> 00:15:19.519 align:start position:0%
on 1097
 
00:15:24.829 --> 00:15:24.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
1037h yes that is the only amendment
 
00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
that's before us and it was distributed
 
00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
last evening so uh okay that's uh
 
00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
representative spillsbury it's your
 
00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:36.800 align:start position:0%
amendment we want to
 
00:15:38.629 --> 00:15:38.639 align:start position:0%
explain your amendment
 
00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:41.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:43.120 align:start position:0%
so i believe
 
00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:46.240 align:start position:0%
in the discussion uh during several work
 
00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:48.320 align:start position:0%
sessions it was generally agreed that
 
00:15:50.069 --> 00:15:50.079 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire needs to do
 
00:15:50.079 --> 00:15:51.189 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire needs to do
something

00:15:51.189 --> 00:15:51.199 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:15:53.189 --> 00:15:53.199 align:start position:0%
to counter the
 
00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:55.120 align:start position:0%
actions of the state of massachusetts
 
00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:56.800 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic
 
00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:57.990 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic
asserting

00:15:57.990 --> 00:15:58.000 align:start position:0%
asserting
 
00:15:59.509 --> 00:15:59.519 align:start position:0%
the power
 
00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:02.160 align:start position:0%
to assess real estate taxes and i mean
 
00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
excuse me income taxes and withholdings
 
00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:08.720 align:start position:0%
on new hampshire residents
 
00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:11.680 align:start position:0%
who previously commuted to work
 
00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:12.470 align:start position:0%
who previously commuted to work
in

00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:14.720 align:start position:0%
massachusetts but were then working from
 
00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
home despite that all the work was being
 
00:16:19.509 --> 00:16:19.519 align:start position:0%
done within the state of new hampshire
 
00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:22.720 align:start position:0%
the original bill as drafted
 
00:16:24.389 --> 00:16:24.399 align:start position:0%
takes the stance
 
00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
that we are going to assert that no
 
00:16:30.069 --> 00:16:30.079 align:start position:0%
other state has the power to do this
 
00:16:32.310 --> 00:16:32.320 align:start position:0%
we don't directly have the ability to
 
00:16:34.389 --> 00:16:34.399 align:start position:0%
define the power of another state or to
 
00:16:37.829 --> 00:16:37.839 align:start position:0%
control it so we decided that we should
 
00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
reframe this so that we can take some
 
00:16:42.629 --> 00:16:42.639 align:start position:0%
action that's meaningful
 
00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:44.320 align:start position:0%
with the idea
 
00:16:47.269 --> 00:16:47.279 align:start position:0%
that if our attorney general again has
 
00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:48.800 align:start position:0%
to litigate
 
00:16:51.749 --> 00:16:51.759 align:start position:0%
we want to give them all the armament
 
00:16:52.949 --> 00:16:52.959 align:start position:0%
they need
 
00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:56.800 align:start position:0%
so that they can cite to a direct
 
00:16:59.110 --> 00:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
position of the state
 
00:17:01.509 --> 00:17:01.519 align:start position:0%
and lay the foundation for a strong
 
00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:04.079 align:start position:0%
claim of standing
 
00:17:06.549 --> 00:17:06.559 align:start position:0%
and in effect it puts us in a position
 
00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:08.240 align:start position:0%
to say
 
00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:10.160 align:start position:0%
while we can't control massachusetts we
 
00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
can defend
 
00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:14.640 align:start position:0%
an infringement on our sovereignty
 
00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
so the bill has three parts
 
00:17:19.909 --> 00:17:19.919 align:start position:0%
the working part is f
 
00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:22.240 align:start position:0%
78f1 purpose
 
00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:24.240 align:start position:0%
this makes the assertion
 
00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:25.669 align:start position:0%
this makes the assertion
that

00:17:25.669 --> 00:17:25.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:28.000 align:start position:0%
we john genegion and i
 
00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:30.720 align:start position:0%
have worked out with sam garland
 
00:17:32.789 --> 00:17:32.799 align:start position:0%
assistant attorney general and king wong
 
00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:34.960 align:start position:0%
at the dra
 
00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:38.000 align:start position:0%
and we're very pleased with it it says
 
00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:39.760 align:start position:0%
in order to promote the health of its
 
00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
economy and the welfare of its citizens
 
00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
by preserving an environment in which
 
00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:46.160 align:start position:0%
labor is not unduly penalized it is
 
00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
declared to be the sovereign interest of
 
00:17:49.029 --> 00:17:49.039 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire that the
 
00:17:51.029 --> 00:17:51.039 align:start position:0%
income earned and received by residents
 
00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:52.720 align:start position:0%
of the state of new hampshire for
 
00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:54.720 align:start position:0%
services entirely performed within the
 
00:17:56.150 --> 00:17:56.160 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire
 
00:17:58.470 --> 00:17:58.480 align:start position:0%
may not be subject to taxation as earned
 
00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:01.360 align:start position:0%
income in any other state
 
00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
the f2 and the f3
 
00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:07.440 align:start position:0%
are qualifiers that are just designed by
 
00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:08.720 align:start position:0%
the dra
 
00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:10.640 align:start position:0%
to ensure that nobody can make an
 
00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:12.630 align:start position:0%
to ensure that nobody can make an
interpretation

00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:12.640 align:start position:0%
interpretation
 
00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
that business taxes uh
 
00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:18.240 align:start position:0%
cannot take account of all business
 
00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:20.240 align:start position:0%
activity wherever it's been done across
 
00:18:22.390 --> 00:18:22.400 align:start position:0%
the for the 50 states or worldwide in
 
00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:23.510 align:start position:0%
the for the 50 states or worldwide in
fact

00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
fact
 
00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:28.640 align:start position:0%
this is just
 
00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
qualify our language to make sure that
 
00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:36.230 align:start position:0%
 
i

00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:36.240 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:38.160 align:start position:0%
wouldn't ordinarily read a blurb but
 
00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
this is fairly technical stuff and so if
 
00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:43.280 align:start position:0%
you'll indulge me i think you probably
 
00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:44.640 align:start position:0%
would benefit from just getting a
 
00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:50.720 align:start position:0%
this bill addresses an issue that arose
 
00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:53.120 align:start position:0%
during the covet 19 pandemic when the
 
00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
commonwealth of massachusetts required
 
00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
that certain new hampshire residents
 
00:18:58.870 --> 00:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
who customarily commuted to work and
 
00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:01.120 align:start position:0%
employer sites within massachusetts but
 
00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:02.960 align:start position:0%
who instead were working exclusively
 
00:19:04.549 --> 00:19:04.559 align:start position:0%
from home in new hampshire
 
00:19:05.909 --> 00:19:05.919 align:start position:0%
should continue to be subject to
 
00:19:07.669 --> 00:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
massachusetts personal income tax and
 
00:19:09.430 --> 00:19:09.440 align:start position:0%
withholding requirements
 
00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:11.600 align:start position:0%
governor sununu immediately lodged
 
00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:13.600 align:start position:0%
objection to this assertion of taxation
 
00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:15.760 align:start position:0%
power across state lines
 
00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:19.360 align:start position:0%
but massachusetts did not back off
 
00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:20.960 align:start position:0%
subsequently new hampshire through its
 
00:19:22.630 --> 00:19:22.640 align:start position:0%
attorney general filed suit before the
 
00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:24.400 align:start position:0%
united states supreme court
 
00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:26.160 align:start position:0%
invoking the court's
 
00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
original jurisdiction quote unquote
 
00:19:30.310 --> 00:19:30.320 align:start position:0%
under the u.s constitution to resolve
 
00:19:32.549 --> 00:19:32.559 align:start position:0%
legal disputes arising directly between
 
00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:34.720 align:start position:0%
two states
 
00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:37.360 align:start position:0%
the court decided to not take the case
 
00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:39.200 align:start position:0%
despite assertions that it was required
 
00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:40.640 align:start position:0%
to do so
 
00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:42.160 align:start position:0%
dismissing the complaint without
 
00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:45.280 align:start position:0%
explanation as is common
 
00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:47.440 align:start position:0%
one can speculate as to why the justice
 
00:19:49.669 --> 00:19:49.679 align:start position:0%
is elected not to take up the case
 
00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:51.440 align:start position:0%
knowing that this is a power that they
 
00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:53.360 align:start position:0%
are reluctant to invoke
 
00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:55.120 align:start position:0%
and knowing that they often seek to
 
00:19:56.710 --> 00:19:56.720 align:start position:0%
avoid further burdening their calendar
 
00:19:58.310 --> 00:19:58.320 align:start position:0%
when they do not believe a particular
 
00:20:01.029 --> 00:20:01.039 align:start position:0%
controversy demands resolution by them
 
00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:03.200 align:start position:0%
at that juncture
 
00:20:05.029 --> 00:20:05.039 align:start position:0%
one possibility is that they did not
 
00:20:07.029 --> 00:20:07.039 align:start position:0%
detect that the state of new hampshire
 
00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:09.760 align:start position:0%
had a sovereign interest to protect
 
00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
independent of the claims of the
 
00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
individually aggrieved taxpayer who
 
00:20:15.029 --> 00:20:15.039 align:start position:0%
might conceivably be asked to litigate
 
00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:16.320 align:start position:0%
in his own right
 
00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
thus drawing into question the issue of
 
00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:20.320 align:start position:0%
standing on the part of the state
 
00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:22.400 align:start position:0%
alternatively they may have conjectured
 
00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
that the dispute was temporary
 
00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:26.400 align:start position:0%
likely to disappear soon as the
 
00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
emergency receded
 
00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:31.600 align:start position:0%
indeed more recently in october 2022
 
00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:33.520 align:start position:0%
massachusetts led its emergency order in
 
00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
this regard lapse as the pandemic was
 
00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:38.480 align:start position:0%
lessening in urgency thus rendering the
 
00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:40.640 align:start position:0%
pending dispute moot
 
00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
even so the committee took up the bill
 
00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:45.440 align:start position:0%
with an eye on preventing a recurrence
 
00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:48.400 align:start position:0%
as originally drafted hb 1097 asserted
 
00:20:51.029 --> 00:20:51.039 align:start position:0%
that quote no state has the power to tax
 
00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:52.720 align:start position:0%
value earned outside of its borders

00:20:57.190 --> 00:20:57.200 align:start position:0%
means of enforcing such an admonishment
 
00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:58.470 align:start position:0%
means of enforcing such an admonishment
directly

00:20:58.470 --> 00:20:58.480 align:start position:0%
directly
 
00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:00.640 align:start position:0%
against any other offending state
 
00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
and it potentially created ambiguities
 
00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:04.880 align:start position:0%
over the term quote value earned close
 
00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:05.830 align:start position:0%

00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
the committee believes that hb
 
00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:10.880 align:start position:0%
1097 addresses a very important issue
 
00:21:12.390 --> 00:21:12.400 align:start position:0%
that was offensive to new hampshire's
 
00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:14.240 align:start position:0%
independent sovereignty and that this
 
00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
issue must still be addressed
 
00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:18.320 align:start position:0%
preemptively lest it arise again without
 
00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:19.830 align:start position:0%
preemptively lest it arise again without
recourse

00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:19.840 align:start position:0%
recourse
 
00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:22.640 align:start position:0%
but the bill needs to be reframed in
 
00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
concert with the attorney general the
 
00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
department of revenue services the
 
00:21:27.669 --> 00:21:27.679 align:start position:0%
committee's amendment seeks to address
 
00:21:30.149 --> 00:21:30.159 align:start position:0%
that weakness by re-aiming the bill
 
00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:32.640 align:start position:0%
towards firmly and unequivocally
 
00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:34.310 align:start position:0%
towards firmly and unequivocally
unequivocally

00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
unequivocally
 
00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:36.640 align:start position:0%
establishing an explicit claim of policy
 
00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:38.480 align:start position:0%
and sovereign interest that will put
 
00:21:40.950 --> 00:21:40.960 align:start position:0%
other states on notice and clearly lay
 
00:21:42.789 --> 00:21:42.799 align:start position:0%
the foundation for successful litigation
 
00:21:47.029 --> 00:21:47.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:58.390 --> 00:21:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:03.669 --> 00:22:03.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:04.960 align:start position:0%
well thank you representative
 
00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
spillsberry for your hard work on this
 
00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:10.240 align:start position:0%
and uh thanks as well to the agencies
 
00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:11.430 align:start position:0%
and uh thanks as well to the agencies
for

00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:11.440 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:13.120 align:start position:0%
working on this with
 
00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
you and whoever else worked on it
 
00:22:18.149 --> 00:22:18.159 align:start position:0%
uh it's a complicated matter i
 
00:22:21.669 --> 00:22:21.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:22.789 --> 00:22:22.799 align:start position:0%
here's my
 
00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
question however
 
00:22:27.990 --> 00:22:28.000 align:start position:0%
uh the concern that i think
 
00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:30.080 align:start position:0%
lies behind in
 
00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:33.280 align:start position:0%
adding the two additional
 
00:22:36.149 --> 00:22:36.159 align:start position:0%
parts about business taxes
 
00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:38.240 align:start position:0%
is that in fact
 
00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:40.320 align:start position:0%
with our business tax and particularly
 
00:22:42.230 --> 00:22:42.240 align:start position:0%
with the adoption of the single sales
 
00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:44.710 align:start position:0%
with the adoption of the single sales
factor

00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:44.720 align:start position:0%
factor
 
00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:46.480 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:22:49.029 --> 00:22:49.039 align:start position:0%
is and will be
 
00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:52.000 align:start position:0%
taxing income
 
00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:54.880 align:start position:0%
earned and received by residents of
 
00:22:57.669 --> 00:22:57.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
who are part of
 
00:23:02.070 --> 00:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
a business enterprise whether it's a
 
00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:03.510 align:start position:0%
a business enterprise whether it's a
partnership

00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
partnership
 
00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:05.840 align:start position:0%
a sales proprietor
 
00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
or a corporation that is selling into
 
00:23:11.029 --> 00:23:11.039 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:23:14.149 --> 00:23:14.159 align:start position:0%
where the services are
 
00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:17.280 align:start position:0%
that are taxed are entirely performed
 
00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:24.320 align:start position:0%
and we want to continue taxing
 
00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:25.990 align:start position:0%
and we want to continue taxing
that

00:23:25.990 --> 00:23:26.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:28.640 align:start position:0%
uh those sales that income is produced
 
00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:31.360 align:start position:0%
by those sales so we didn't i believe
 
00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:33.440 align:start position:0%
these sections are in there
 
00:23:34.789 --> 00:23:34.799 align:start position:0%
to make clear that we want to keep
 
00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:37.440 align:start position:0%
taxing them well so do other states want
 
00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:40.480 align:start position:0%
to keep taxing us
 
00:23:43.430 --> 00:23:43.440 align:start position:0%
as we sell our businesses sell
 
00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:45.360 align:start position:0%
into those other states
 
00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:46.960 align:start position:0%
so it seems to me you're setting up a
 
00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
double standard
 
00:23:52.549 --> 00:23:52.559 align:start position:0%
and a situation that's uh
 
00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:54.640 align:start position:0%
very unlikely
 
00:23:57.590 --> 00:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
uh and i haven't researched this i
 
00:23:59.830 --> 00:23:59.840 align:start position:0%
no other lawyers may have
 
00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
to survive an undue burden challenge
 
00:24:05.029 --> 00:24:05.039 align:start position:0%
under the commerce clause
 
00:24:10.870 --> 00:24:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:12.640 align:start position:0%
thank you representative ames as you
 
00:24:14.470 --> 00:24:14.480 align:start position:0%
said it's a complicated
 
00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:15.830 align:start position:0%
said it's a complicated
topic

00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
topic
 
00:24:17.669 --> 00:24:17.679 align:start position:0%
part of what complicates it is
 
00:24:17.679 --> 00:24:19.750 align:start position:0%
part of what complicates it is
distinguishing

00:24:19.750 --> 00:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
distinguishing
 
00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:22.400 align:start position:0%
income taxes from other taxes
 
00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:24.149 align:start position:0%
income taxes from other taxes
distinguishing

00:24:24.149 --> 00:24:24.159 align:start position:0%
distinguishing
 
00:24:26.789 --> 00:24:26.799 align:start position:0%
income tax on personal income versus
 
00:24:28.549 --> 00:24:28.559 align:start position:0%
business income
 
00:24:28.559 --> 00:24:30.390 align:start position:0%
business income
distinguishing

00:24:30.390 --> 00:24:30.400 align:start position:0%
distinguishing
 
00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:32.640 align:start position:0%
income that may be earned as a w-2
 
00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:36.480 align:start position:0%
employee versus as a 1099 contractor
 
00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
versus as a pass-through
 
00:24:40.390 --> 00:24:40.400 align:start position:0%
business entity
 
00:24:42.149 --> 00:24:42.159 align:start position:0%
using the benefit of
 
00:24:45.029 --> 00:24:45.039 align:start position:0%
sub-chapter s or llc
 
00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
or sole proprietorship so it's a very
 
00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:49.760 align:start position:0%
complicated area
 
00:24:52.149 --> 00:24:52.159 align:start position:0%
i don't know whether we have solved it
 
00:24:54.310 --> 00:24:54.320 align:start position:0%
i hope that we have come as close to the
 
00:24:57.350 --> 00:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:57.360 --> 00:24:58.789 align:start position:0%
 
it's

00:24:58.789 --> 00:24:58.799 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:24:58.799 --> 00:25:00.390 align:start position:0%
it's
intended

00:25:00.390 --> 00:25:00.400 align:start position:0%
intended
 
00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:02.720 align:start position:0%
to clearly refer to
 
00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
taxation of personally earned income
 
00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:08.720 align:start position:0%
and the purpose of the second and third
 
00:25:10.710 --> 00:25:10.720 align:start position:0%
paragraphs is to make a distinction with
 
00:25:12.549 --> 00:25:12.559 align:start position:0%
the business tax
 
00:25:14.390 --> 00:25:14.400 align:start position:0%
where i don't think it's so much that we
 
00:25:16.470 --> 00:25:16.480 align:start position:0%
tax activity elsewhere it's that we take
 
00:25:18.149 --> 00:25:18.159 align:start position:0%
account of all activity and we use
 
00:25:19.909 --> 00:25:19.919 align:start position:0%
certainly certain formulas and
 
00:25:21.590 --> 00:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
proportions which are in common use
 
00:25:23.350 --> 00:25:23.360 align:start position:0%
across the country
 
00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:24.310 align:start position:0%
across the country
so

00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:24.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:26.640 align:start position:0%
time will tell
 
00:25:30.149 --> 00:25:30.159 align:start position:0%
how successful we we are
 
00:25:31.909 --> 00:25:31.919 align:start position:0%
but at the moment there is nothing in
 
00:25:34.390 --> 00:25:34.400 align:start position:0%
our law that would uh help lay the
 
00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:36.720 align:start position:0%
foundation for a similar lawsuit if the
 
00:25:41.669 --> 00:25:41.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:45.669 --> 00:25:45.679 align:start position:0%
we have a representation from the dra
 
00:25:48.630 --> 00:25:48.640 align:start position:0%
does the dra have any comments on what
 
00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:51.520 align:start position:0%
representative ames and representative
 
00:26:06.149 --> 00:26:06.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:09.269 --> 00:26:09.279 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is king ming wong
 
00:26:10.870 --> 00:26:10.880 align:start position:0%
tax policy council from the department
 
00:26:13.669 --> 00:26:13.679 align:start position:0%
of revenue agency administration
 
00:26:18.149 --> 00:26:18.159 align:start position:0%
we haven't specifically looked into the
 
00:26:20.310 --> 00:26:20.320 align:start position:0%
commerce clause consequences of this
 
00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:21.350 align:start position:0%
commerce clause consequences of this
bill

00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:21.360 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:26:24.549 --> 00:26:24.559 align:start position:0%
our main objective was to ensure that
 
00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:26.960 align:start position:0%
any language that was proposed in this
 
00:26:30.549 --> 00:26:30.559 align:start position:0%
bill would not negatively impact the the
 
00:26:32.549 --> 00:26:32.559 align:start position:0%
operations and the administration of the
 
00:26:32.559 --> 00:26:33.430 align:start position:0%
operations and the administration of the
business

00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:33.440 align:start position:0%
business
 
00:26:35.590 --> 00:26:35.600 align:start position:0%
taxes that we currently have
 
00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:36.710 align:start position:0%
taxes that we currently have
so

00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:36.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:26:38.950 --> 00:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
that's the purpose of the the additional
 
00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
two chapter additional two sections
 
00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:48.640 align:start position:0%
representative army
 
00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:52.320 align:start position:0%
oh representative ames
 
00:26:56.789 --> 00:26:56.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:59.669 --> 00:26:59.679 align:start position:0%
the difficulty that uh we face as a
 
00:27:02.789 --> 00:27:02.799 align:start position:0%
committee right now is that uh
 
00:27:06.070 --> 00:27:06.080 align:start position:0%
we've just received this amendment
 
00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:12.240 align:start position:0%
and although it's just three
 
00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:14.240 align:start position:0%
long sentences or maybe there's a couple
 
00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
more in there
 
00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:16.549 align:start position:0%
more in there
it's

00:27:16.549 --> 00:27:16.559 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:27:19.669 --> 00:27:19.679 align:start position:0%
complicated as you just said and
 
00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
if indeed the
 
00:27:24.310 --> 00:27:24.320 align:start position:0%
objective is to
 
00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:26.640 align:start position:0%
narrow the scope to
 
00:27:29.590 --> 00:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
income that's subject to income taxes
 
00:27:30.950 --> 00:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
per se
 
00:27:33.430 --> 00:27:33.440 align:start position:0%
and not business taxes
 
00:27:38.549 --> 00:27:38.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:40.549 --> 00:27:40.559 align:start position:0%
we could work on this language to
 
00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
improve it
 
00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
if we had time
 
00:27:46.630 --> 00:27:46.640 align:start position:0%
i gather we don't have time
 
00:27:49.110 --> 00:27:49.120 align:start position:0%
because we're here and uh i think this
 
00:27:51.269 --> 00:27:51.279 align:start position:0%
afternoon is the deadline for
 
00:27:53.909 --> 00:27:53.919 align:start position:0%
filing reports on bills like this
 
00:27:57.110 --> 00:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
so we've run out of time and an option
 
00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:00.240 align:start position:0%
is interim study i imagine that's not
 
00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:02.640 align:start position:0%
uh that's frowned on um
 
00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:03.669 align:start position:0%
uh that's frowned on um
or

00:28:03.669 --> 00:28:03.679 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:28:06.230 --> 00:28:06.240 align:start position:0%
may be objected to um
 
00:28:08.710 --> 00:28:08.720 align:start position:0%
but that to me would be preferable
 
00:28:11.669 --> 00:28:11.679 align:start position:0%
there's no urgency to this whatsoever
 
00:28:13.909 --> 00:28:13.919 align:start position:0%
that i know of as you've pointed out
 
00:28:16.630 --> 00:28:16.640 align:start position:0%
massachusetts has backed away from
 
00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:17.430 align:start position:0%
massachusetts has backed away from
the

00:28:17.430 --> 00:28:17.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:28:20.870 --> 00:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
initiative during covid that
 
00:28:23.510 --> 00:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
led to litigation and so that's not on
 
00:28:26.149 --> 00:28:26.159 align:start position:0%
the table anymore no one is trying to
 
00:28:30.549 --> 00:28:30.559 align:start position:0%
tax the personal income earned by
 
00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:32.720 align:start position:0%
new hampshire residents
 
00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:35.840 align:start position:0%
for doing work in new hampshire
 
00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:38.880 align:start position:0%
for out of state firms and then being
 
00:28:41.190 --> 00:28:41.200 align:start position:0%
taxed by the out of state
 
00:28:43.269 --> 00:28:43.279 align:start position:0%
by that state
 
00:28:45.909 --> 00:28:45.919 align:start position:0%
so i i don't think there's any urgency i
 
00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:48.720 align:start position:0%
know interim study right now means
 
00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
a year of study and then a bill and a
 
00:28:54.389 --> 00:28:54.399 align:start position:0%
new legislature next year and that may
 
00:28:55.830 --> 00:28:55.840 align:start position:0%
not be uh
 
00:28:57.830 --> 00:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
what you want but
 
00:28:59.190 --> 00:28:59.200 align:start position:0%
why not
 
00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:02.000 align:start position:0%
do a good job with the language
 
00:29:06.070 --> 00:29:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:07.840 align:start position:0%
thank you representative ames
 
00:29:10.389 --> 00:29:10.399 align:start position:0%
representative alani
 
00:29:12.389 --> 00:29:12.399 align:start position:0%
thank you uh
 
00:29:15.510 --> 00:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
i have a question for
 
00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:16.960 align:start position:0%
attorney wong
 
00:29:19.029 --> 00:29:19.039 align:start position:0%
but first i wanted to
 
00:29:20.549 --> 00:29:20.559 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:23.440 align:start position:0%
that purpose
 
00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:24.389 align:start position:0%
that purpose
is

00:29:24.389 --> 00:29:24.399 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:29:24.399 --> 00:29:25.669 align:start position:0%
is
um

00:29:25.669 --> 00:29:25.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:28.389 --> 00:29:28.399 align:start position:0%
something that they usually take out of
 
00:29:30.630 --> 00:29:30.640 align:start position:0%
the bills when they put them into the
 
00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:31.669 align:start position:0%
the bills when they put them into the
law

00:29:31.669 --> 00:29:31.679 align:start position:0%
law
 
00:29:34.149 --> 00:29:34.159 align:start position:0%
and i can't remember if we've ever put
 
00:29:36.549 --> 00:29:36.559 align:start position:0%
purpose into the law
 
00:29:37.990 --> 00:29:38.000 align:start position:0%
in which case
 
00:29:40.149 --> 00:29:40.159 align:start position:0%
if it was taken out this wouldn't make
 
00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
any sense so
 
00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:44.310 align:start position:0%
any sense so
uh

00:29:44.310 --> 00:29:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:47.750 --> 00:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
has anyone looked into that
 
00:29:50.389 --> 00:29:50.399 align:start position:0%
um representative olerie seems to
 
00:29:50.399 --> 00:29:51.669 align:start position:0%
um representative olerie seems to
think

00:29:51.669 --> 00:29:51.679 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:29:51.679 --> 00:29:52.710 align:start position:0%
think
yeah

00:29:52.710 --> 00:29:52.720 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:54.080 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:55.520 align:start position:0%
uh representative all me there are
 
00:29:57.590 --> 00:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
several instances where the the general
 
00:29:57.600 --> 00:29:58.389 align:start position:0%
several instances where the the general
court

00:29:58.389 --> 00:29:58.399 align:start position:0%
court
 
00:30:01.830 --> 00:30:01.840 align:start position:0%
has put in the purpose or intent
 
00:30:04.310 --> 00:30:04.320 align:start position:0%
uh when you say uh purpose in this uh
 
00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:07.360 align:start position:0%
section it's actually an intense section
 
00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
yeah so that's
 
00:30:12.630 --> 00:30:12.640 align:start position:0%
yeah that we've done that before on a
 
00:30:16.710 --> 00:30:16.720 align:start position:0%
wide range laws mostly criminal but
 
00:30:19.029 --> 00:30:19.039 align:start position:0%
you know this is tax law so might as
 
00:30:21.350 --> 00:30:21.360 align:start position:0%
well say what it's about thank you
 
00:30:23.110 --> 00:30:23.120 align:start position:0%
thank you could i
 
00:30:27.269 --> 00:30:27.279 align:start position:0%
first the second question though on
 
00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:29.840 align:start position:0%
representative hollery has seen this so
 
00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:30.870 align:start position:0%
representative hollery has seen this so
um

00:30:30.870 --> 00:30:30.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:33.909 --> 00:30:33.919 align:start position:0%
i wanted to ask attorney wong
 
00:30:33.919 --> 00:30:34.870 align:start position:0%
i wanted to ask attorney wong
if

00:30:34.870 --> 00:30:34.880 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:30:37.269 --> 00:30:37.279 align:start position:0%
you see any chance
 
00:30:37.279 --> 00:30:39.269 align:start position:0%
you see any chance
that

00:30:39.269 --> 00:30:39.279 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:30:43.029 --> 00:30:43.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:45.029 --> 00:30:45.039 align:start position:0%
could take
 
00:30:48.070 --> 00:30:48.080 align:start position:0%
sections two and three of this versus
 
00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
section one and start a lawsuit about
 
00:30:59.269 --> 00:30:59.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:01.750 --> 00:31:01.760 align:start position:0%
i don't expect that the that the issues
 
00:31:05.029 --> 00:31:05.039 align:start position:0%
would arise from sections two and three
 
00:31:06.549 --> 00:31:06.559 align:start position:0%
because the sections two entries
 
00:31:09.509 --> 00:31:09.519 align:start position:0%
specifically just um says that
 
00:31:10.630 --> 00:31:10.640 align:start position:0%
uh to
 
00:31:15.110 --> 00:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
to maintain the integrity of our uh bptn
 
00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:16.830 align:start position:0%
to maintain the integrity of our uh bptn
bet

00:31:16.830 --> 00:31:16.840 align:start position:0%
bet
 
00:31:19.909 --> 00:31:19.919 align:start position:0%
chapters so um
 
00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:22.320 align:start position:0%
so if any i really don't expect that
 
00:31:23.430 --> 00:31:23.440 align:start position:0%
there's any
 
00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:25.600 align:start position:0%
any tax practitioner
 
00:31:27.909 --> 00:31:27.919 align:start position:0%
would just parse out
 
00:31:29.750 --> 00:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
sections two and three
 
00:31:32.389 --> 00:31:32.399 align:start position:0%
and make a challenge
 
00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:34.480 align:start position:0%
there's no language in there that would
 
00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:35.909 align:start position:0%
there's no language in there that would
contradict

00:31:35.909 --> 00:31:35.919 align:start position:0%
contradict
 
00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:38.240 align:start position:0%
our existing statutes
 
00:31:40.870 --> 00:31:40.880 align:start position:0%
could i clarify
 
00:31:44.830 --> 00:31:44.840 align:start position:0%
don't don't two and three acknowledge
 
00:31:48.870 --> 00:31:48.880 align:start position:0%
that we are doing something
 
00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:51.840 align:start position:0%
related and together with section one
 
00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that we are doing something
 
00:31:56.789 --> 00:31:56.799 align:start position:0%
that is uh
 
00:31:59.509 --> 00:31:59.519 align:start position:0%
opposed to what we're asking others to
 
00:31:59.519 --> 00:32:11.269 align:start position:0%
opposed to what we're asking others to
do

00:32:11.269 --> 00:32:11.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:13.669 --> 00:32:13.679 align:start position:0%
are you saying that i'm so
 
00:32:15.990 --> 00:32:16.000 align:start position:0%
section so the issues with with section
 
00:32:17.509 --> 00:32:17.519 align:start position:0%
one then
 
00:32:20.149 --> 00:32:20.159 align:start position:0%
well with the combination combination
 
00:32:20.159 --> 00:32:21.110 align:start position:0%
well with the combination combination
thereof

00:32:21.110 --> 00:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
thereof
 
00:32:22.950 --> 00:32:22.960 align:start position:0%
maybe if we'd hidden two and three
 
00:32:26.149 --> 00:32:26.159 align:start position:0%
somewhere else oh okay
 
00:32:26.159 --> 00:32:27.029 align:start position:0%
somewhere else oh okay
um

00:32:27.029 --> 00:32:27.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
yes so with without two and three um
 
00:32:33.909 --> 00:32:33.919 align:start position:0%
section one
 
00:32:36.389 --> 00:32:36.399 align:start position:0%
still still works but i was just so our
 
00:32:38.389 --> 00:32:38.399 align:start position:0%
concern is that tax partition
 
00:32:39.990 --> 00:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
practitioners that we've seen in the
 
00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:40.950 align:start position:0%
practitioners that we've seen in the
past

00:32:40.950 --> 00:32:40.960 align:start position:0%
past
 
00:32:43.509 --> 00:32:43.519 align:start position:0%
would potentially could potentially read
 
00:32:45.669 --> 00:32:45.679 align:start position:0%
section one
 
00:32:45.679 --> 00:32:46.470 align:start position:0%
section one
so

00:32:46.470 --> 00:32:46.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:32:48.149 --> 00:32:48.159 align:start position:0%
usually the
 
00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:50.640 align:start position:0%
statutory interpretation is to read the
 
00:32:52.230 --> 00:32:52.240 align:start position:0%
statute as it is
 
00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:53.590 align:start position:0%
statute as it is
and

00:32:53.590 --> 00:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:32:56.310 --> 00:32:56.320 align:start position:0%
and apply it as it is but we have seen
 
00:32:59.509 --> 00:32:59.519 align:start position:0%
in in our practice that um
 
00:33:01.830 --> 00:33:01.840 align:start position:0%
in our agency that some tax
 
00:33:03.430 --> 00:33:03.440 align:start position:0%
practitioners would read a certain
 
00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:07.440 align:start position:0%
statute and somehow read the inverse
 
00:33:10.389 --> 00:33:10.399 align:start position:0%
to be accurate and to be law as well so
 
00:33:13.590 --> 00:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
what the statute might say okay uh
 
00:33:15.990 --> 00:33:16.000 align:start position:0%
text might be not applicable to this
 
00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
situation and then they will read it
 
00:33:19.909 --> 00:33:19.919 align:start position:0%
okay so the inverse would be
 
00:33:20.950 --> 00:33:20.960 align:start position:0%
true then
 
00:33:23.509 --> 00:33:23.519 align:start position:0%
so that's the purpose of having uh
 
00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:25.760 align:start position:0%
sections two and three so to avoid any
 
00:33:30.549 --> 00:33:30.559 align:start position:0%
kind of inverse reading of section one
 
00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
i don't know if that answers a question
 
00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
not really because it's such a
 
00:33:39.110 --> 00:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
complicated area behind this
 
00:33:42.389 --> 00:33:42.399 align:start position:0%
fairly simple language thank you
 
00:33:42.399 --> 00:33:46.149 align:start position:0%
fairly simple language thank you
representative

00:33:46.149 --> 00:33:46.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:33:50.230 --> 00:33:50.240 align:start position:0%
i want to call everyone's attention to
 
00:33:53.830 --> 00:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
line 10 of the amendment
 
00:33:56.070 --> 00:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
and if we look at line 10
 
00:33:57.909 --> 00:33:57.919 align:start position:0%
the end of that
 
00:34:00.070 --> 00:34:00.080 align:start position:0%
line where it says
 
00:34:02.470 --> 00:34:02.480 align:start position:0%
for services entirely performed within
 
00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:05.360 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire may
 
00:34:07.509 --> 00:34:07.519 align:start position:0%
not be subject so the word may
 
00:34:09.349 --> 00:34:09.359 align:start position:0%
i want to call attention to that word
 
00:34:12.710 --> 00:34:12.720 align:start position:0%
because previously the word was shall
 
00:34:13.909 --> 00:34:13.919 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:34:15.270 --> 00:34:15.280 align:start position:0%
one of the things that the attorney
 
00:34:17.030 --> 00:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
general's office
 
00:34:18.950 --> 00:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
wanted to change was the word from shall
 
00:34:21.750 --> 00:34:21.760 align:start position:0%
to may to soften this
 
00:34:24.470 --> 00:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:26.069 --> 00:34:26.079 align:start position:0%
it would be less likely that someone
 
00:34:27.909 --> 00:34:27.919 align:start position:0%
misinterprets this
 
00:34:27.919 --> 00:34:28.790 align:start position:0%
misinterprets this
but

00:34:28.790 --> 00:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:29.669 align:start position:0%
but
still

00:34:29.669 --> 00:34:29.679 align:start position:0%
still
 
00:34:31.349 --> 00:34:31.359 align:start position:0%
moving this forward gives them the
 
00:34:33.349 --> 00:34:33.359 align:start position:0%
ability if they have to to go back to
 
00:34:35.430 --> 00:34:35.440 align:start position:0%
the supreme court and so i think that
 
00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:36.720 align:start position:0%
word may
 
00:34:38.470 --> 00:34:38.480 align:start position:0%
softens it and
 
00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:39.190 align:start position:0%
softens it and
and

00:34:39.190 --> 00:34:39.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:40.310 align:start position:0%
and
should

00:34:40.310 --> 00:34:40.320 align:start position:0%
should
 
00:34:41.990 --> 00:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
make this less
 
00:34:43.589 --> 00:34:43.599 align:start position:0%
much less of a concern than when the
 
00:34:45.430 --> 00:34:45.440 align:start position:0%
word shall was there
 
00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
and just as a further comment i'd like
 
00:34:49.909 --> 00:34:49.919 align:start position:0%
to say that while massachusetts has
 
00:34:52.950 --> 00:34:52.960 align:start position:0%
backed off and right this minute there
 
00:34:55.990 --> 00:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:58.630 --> 00:34:58.640 align:start position:0%
the issue is if some other problem comes
 
00:35:00.870 --> 00:35:00.880 align:start position:0%
up who knows where this
 
00:35:03.750 --> 00:35:03.760 align:start position:0%
whole energy issue is going maybe it
 
00:35:05.510 --> 00:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
gets to the point where people don't
 
00:35:07.190 --> 00:35:07.200 align:start position:0%
want to drive people are at home again
 
00:35:09.190 --> 00:35:09.200 align:start position:0%
massachusetts comes back again and says
 
00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
hey we're back to that same thing again
 
00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
and we don't have the time
 
00:35:15.430 --> 00:35:15.440 align:start position:0%
we can't react who knows how long it's
 
00:35:16.550 --> 00:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
going to take us to react it's going to
 
00:35:18.630 --> 00:35:18.640 align:start position:0%
be at least a year until we can react to
 
00:35:21.190 --> 00:35:21.200 align:start position:0%
that so i would i would propose that we
 
00:35:23.589 --> 00:35:23.599 align:start position:0%
move forward uh with this
 
00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:26.240 align:start position:0%
and we and we take note of the word may
 
00:35:29.670 --> 00:35:29.680 align:start position:0%
in line 10. thank you
 
00:35:33.190 --> 00:35:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:35.910 --> 00:35:35.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um thank you for
 
00:35:37.990 --> 00:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
pointing out the word may which makes
 
00:35:43.349 --> 00:35:43.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:45.670 --> 00:35:45.680 align:start position:0%
rubbed on ames
 
00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:48.150 align:start position:0%
rubbed on ames
yeah

00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:48.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:50.950 --> 00:35:50.960 align:start position:0%
representative uhler is always uh
 
00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:52.470 align:start position:0%
representative uhler is always uh
so

00:35:52.470 --> 00:35:52.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:35:54.550 --> 00:35:54.560 align:start position:0%
precise in his wording
 
00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:56.470 align:start position:0%
precise in his wording
uh

00:35:56.470 --> 00:35:56.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:35:59.430 --> 00:35:59.440 align:start position:0%
that i uh i'm left scratching my head
 
00:36:00.790 --> 00:36:00.800 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:02.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for that um
 
00:36:05.270 --> 00:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
and it really i think is uh is the
 
00:36:08.390 --> 00:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
question i was going to raise uh
 
00:36:10.150 --> 00:36:10.160 align:start position:0%
if you
 
00:36:13.109 --> 00:36:13.119 align:start position:0%
emphasize that word may
 
00:36:15.349 --> 00:36:15.359 align:start position:0%
which is
 
00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:17.680 align:start position:0%
apparently uh
 
00:36:21.109 --> 00:36:21.119 align:start position:0%
a critical component of this redraft
 
00:36:21.119 --> 00:36:21.990 align:start position:0%
a critical component of this redraft
um

00:36:21.990 --> 00:36:22.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:23.430 --> 00:36:23.440 align:start position:0%
then you've taken haven't you taken the
 
00:36:25.750 --> 00:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
guts out of this whole thing and the
 
00:36:27.990 --> 00:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
supreme court
 
00:36:30.630 --> 00:36:30.640 align:start position:0%
is not going to go forward on a
 
00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:33.200 align:start position:0%
matter where
 
00:36:35.430 --> 00:36:35.440 align:start position:0%
where it's sort of discretionary whether
 
00:36:37.349 --> 00:36:37.359 align:start position:0%
the state will do something it's only if
 
00:36:41.589 --> 00:36:41.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
if new hampshire interprets this as a
 
00:36:46.710 --> 00:36:46.720 align:start position:0%
shell in a particular context
 
00:36:50.470 --> 00:36:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:52.950 --> 00:36:52.960 align:start position:0%
does something to some corporation
 
00:36:54.950 --> 00:36:54.960 align:start position:0%
that there'll be an issue sufficient for
 
00:36:57.109 --> 00:36:57.119 align:start position:0%
the supreme court to take it on
 
00:36:59.670 --> 00:36:59.680 align:start position:0%
and uh so i think that uh
 
00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:02.480 align:start position:0%
that understanding further
 
00:37:05.190 --> 00:37:05.200 align:start position:0%
uh persuades me that this bill
 
00:37:11.510 --> 00:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:13.910 --> 00:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
representative spillsbury
 
00:37:16.150 --> 00:37:16.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:37:17.430 --> 00:37:17.440 align:start position:0%
i'd like to
 
00:37:18.950 --> 00:37:18.960 align:start position:0%
respond to several different comments
 
00:37:21.270 --> 00:37:21.280 align:start position:0%
that have been made
 
00:37:22.870 --> 00:37:22.880 align:start position:0%
first of all
 
00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
i do not understand this may shell
 
00:37:27.829 --> 00:37:27.839 align:start position:0%
distinction the same way it's just been
 
00:37:27.839 --> 00:37:29.270 align:start position:0%
distinction the same way it's just been
described

00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
described
 
00:37:31.510 --> 00:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
you may not do something means you can't
 
00:37:35.750 --> 00:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:37.109 align:start position:0%
 
second

00:37:37.109 --> 00:37:37.119 align:start position:0%
second
 
00:37:39.349 --> 00:37:39.359 align:start position:0%
i acknowledge the tension
 
00:37:42.470 --> 00:37:42.480 align:start position:0%
between the personal income tax position
 
00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:43.750 align:start position:0%
between the personal income tax position
and

00:37:43.750 --> 00:37:43.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:37:45.190 --> 00:37:45.200 align:start position:0%
perhaps it would be better to have the
 
00:37:46.870 --> 00:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
word position
 
00:37:49.030 --> 00:37:49.040 align:start position:0%
instead of purpose at the beginning of
 
00:37:51.910 --> 00:37:51.920 align:start position:0%
paragraph 78 f1 position is the word
 
00:37:54.390 --> 00:37:54.400 align:start position:0%
that's used in line three describing the
 
00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:55.750 align:start position:0%
that's used in line three describing the
chapter

00:37:55.750 --> 00:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
chapter
 
00:37:58.550 --> 00:37:58.560 align:start position:0%
and again in line six in the caption
 
00:38:00.390 --> 00:38:00.400 align:start position:0%
so i don't think that's really ambiguous
 
00:38:02.829 --> 00:38:02.839 align:start position:0%
what's being done here
 
00:38:07.430 --> 00:38:07.440 align:start position:0%
the tension is inherent in the problem
 
00:38:09.750 --> 00:38:09.760 align:start position:0%
and i had preferred that we not have the
 
00:38:11.670 --> 00:38:11.680 align:start position:0%
second and third paragraphs but i
 
00:38:14.310 --> 00:38:14.320 align:start position:0%
consider them to be essentially harmless
 
00:38:17.829 --> 00:38:17.839 align:start position:0%
they don't detract from paragraph one
 
00:38:17.839 --> 00:38:19.109 align:start position:0%
they don't detract from paragraph one
and

00:38:19.109 --> 00:38:19.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:38:21.109 --> 00:38:21.119 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:22.480 align:start position:0%
one could
 
00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
potentially critique or handicap
 
00:38:28.230 --> 00:38:28.240 align:start position:0%
the potency of paragraph one if the
 
00:38:30.710 --> 00:38:30.720 align:start position:0%
situation arises i would rather have
 
00:38:36.950 --> 00:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:39.910 --> 00:38:39.920 align:start position:0%
representative tucker
 
00:38:41.270 --> 00:38:41.280 align:start position:0%
yeah i
 
00:38:42.790 --> 00:38:42.800 align:start position:0%
i'm afraid
 
00:38:45.030 --> 00:38:45.040 align:start position:0%
representative genegan got to my point
 
00:38:48.390 --> 00:38:48.400 align:start position:0%
uh but i wanted to amplify it and that
 
00:38:50.550 --> 00:38:50.560 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:38:52.950 --> 00:38:52.960 align:start position:0%
because of the particular time now in
 
00:38:56.310 --> 00:38:56.320 align:start position:0%
international relations with russia and
 
00:38:56.320 --> 00:38:57.589 align:start position:0%
international relations with russia and
uh

00:38:57.589 --> 00:38:57.599 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:39:00.390 --> 00:39:00.400 align:start position:0%
the invasion of ukraine
 
00:39:03.190 --> 00:39:03.200 align:start position:0%
it certainly has made us much more aware
 
00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:04.310 align:start position:0%
it certainly has made us much more aware
of

00:39:04.310 --> 00:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:06.720 align:start position:0%
the rapidity with which
 
00:39:09.030 --> 00:39:09.040 align:start position:0%
energy prices can arise
 
00:39:11.510 --> 00:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
just the way two years ago we learned
 
00:39:13.349 --> 00:39:13.359 align:start position:0%
about the rapidity
 
00:39:15.109 --> 00:39:15.119 align:start position:0%
of how
 
00:39:17.430 --> 00:39:17.440 align:start position:0%
the reaction to the pandemic
 
00:39:19.750 --> 00:39:19.760 align:start position:0%
and the vast changes that have taken
 
00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:20.790 align:start position:0%
and the vast changes that have taken
place

00:39:20.790 --> 00:39:20.800 align:start position:0%
place
 
00:39:24.390 --> 00:39:24.400 align:start position:0%
so it's true that
 
00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:26.640 align:start position:0%
we first were thinking of this in terms
 
00:39:29.430 --> 00:39:29.440 align:start position:0%
of the pandemic and that we had time to
 
00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:31.190 align:start position:0%
of the pandemic and that we had time to
react

00:39:31.190 --> 00:39:31.200 align:start position:0%
react
 
00:39:33.270 --> 00:39:33.280 align:start position:0%
and it there was no rush
 
00:39:35.589 --> 00:39:35.599 align:start position:0%
but i'm thinking that really the last
 
00:39:37.190 --> 00:39:37.200 align:start position:0%
couple of years have taught us that
 
00:39:39.430 --> 00:39:39.440 align:start position:0%
things happen rapidly
 
00:39:42.470 --> 00:39:42.480 align:start position:0%
and we need to be prepared
 
00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:43.750 align:start position:0%
and we need to be prepared
presumably

00:39:43.750 --> 00:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
presumably
 
00:39:46.230 --> 00:39:46.240 align:start position:0%
as this goes forward to the senate
 
00:39:48.150 --> 00:39:48.160 align:start position:0%
there'd be chances to
 
00:39:50.069 --> 00:39:50.079 align:start position:0%
tweak some language
 
00:39:52.870 --> 00:39:52.880 align:start position:0%
but i would feel more comfortable
 
00:39:55.190 --> 00:39:55.200 align:start position:0%
if we had a reaction
 
00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:56.390 align:start position:0%
if we had a reaction
now

00:39:56.390 --> 00:39:56.400 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:58.150 align:start position:0%
now
and

00:39:58.150 --> 00:39:58.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:40:01.510 --> 00:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
i'm interested in seeing whether we can
 
00:40:09.990 --> 00:40:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
represented hacking phillips
 
00:40:14.870 --> 00:40:14.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
00:40:17.190 --> 00:40:17.200 align:start position:0%
i think it's just an important moment
 
00:40:19.910 --> 00:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
for the committee to reflect possibly on
 
00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:22.720 align:start position:0%
the general hypothetical
 
00:40:26.309 --> 00:40:26.319 align:start position:0%
confronting us as a state if we set up a
 
00:40:28.950 --> 00:40:28.960 align:start position:0%
law that tries to tell other states what
 
00:40:30.630 --> 00:40:30.640 align:start position:0%
it can and cannot do
 
00:40:32.309 --> 00:40:32.319 align:start position:0%
does that open the door for a
 
00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
neighboring state to set up a law
 
00:40:38.950 --> 00:40:38.960 align:start position:0%
to tell us what we can and cannot do and
 
00:40:41.190 --> 00:40:41.200 align:start position:0%
uh you know just going through that
 
00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:42.720 align:start position:0%
exercise in your own mind right now i'm
 
00:40:44.550 --> 00:40:44.560 align:start position:0%
sure we can all come up with scenarios
 
00:40:46.710 --> 00:40:46.720 align:start position:0%
that would be really unpleasant
 
00:40:48.870 --> 00:40:48.880 align:start position:0%
for all of us and i think
 
00:40:51.589 --> 00:40:51.599 align:start position:0%
you know the the tax consequences to our
 
00:40:54.870 --> 00:40:54.880 align:start position:0%
taxpayers for proposing laws
 
00:40:56.950 --> 00:40:56.960 align:start position:0%
that are known to be
 
00:40:56.960 --> 00:40:58.710 align:start position:0%
that are known to be
litigated

00:40:58.710 --> 00:40:58.720 align:start position:0%
litigated
 
00:41:01.190 --> 00:41:01.200 align:start position:0%
on such a premise
 
00:41:02.790 --> 00:41:02.800 align:start position:0%
is probably
 
00:41:06.150 --> 00:41:06.160 align:start position:0%
not expedient at this moment and i do
 
00:41:08.710 --> 00:41:08.720 align:start position:0%
think that the idea is valuable
 
00:41:11.750 --> 00:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
to research further and i i definitely
 
00:41:15.190 --> 00:41:15.200 align:start position:0%
side with representative ames in this
 
00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:16.309 align:start position:0%
side with representative ames in this
position

00:41:16.309 --> 00:41:16.319 align:start position:0%
position
 
00:41:18.150 --> 00:41:18.160 align:start position:0%
uh that more
 
00:41:19.670 --> 00:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
more needs to be done
 
00:41:22.470 --> 00:41:22.480 align:start position:0%
at the ag's office to assure us that the
 
00:41:26.069 --> 00:41:26.079 align:start position:0%
language we're proposing is worth um
 
00:41:27.589 --> 00:41:27.599 align:start position:0%
you know backing
 
00:41:29.430 --> 00:41:29.440 align:start position:0%
fully in this lang you know in this
 
00:41:31.030 --> 00:41:31.040 align:start position:0%
amendment if this is the law that we'd
 
00:41:33.030 --> 00:41:33.040 align:start position:0%
like to move forward with
 
00:41:35.670 --> 00:41:35.680 align:start position:0%
i i do think that the timing is just too
 
00:41:38.230 --> 00:41:38.240 align:start position:0%
quick to reach that um
 
00:41:40.710 --> 00:41:40.720 align:start position:0%
level of comfortability at this moment
 
00:41:44.069 --> 00:41:44.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:45.589 --> 00:41:45.599 align:start position:0%
you know i think we're setting ourselves
 
00:41:46.710 --> 00:41:46.720 align:start position:0%
up for
 
00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:48.720 align:start position:0%
quite a fight and i'm not sure we're
 
00:41:50.550 --> 00:41:50.560 align:start position:0%
putting ourselves in the best position
 
00:41:53.109 --> 00:41:53.119 align:start position:0%
to make that fight successful so those
 
00:41:54.630 --> 00:41:54.640 align:start position:0%
are my those are my thoughts thank you

00:42:08.950 --> 00:42:08.960 align:start position:0%
states tell people
 
00:42:11.190 --> 00:42:11.200 align:start position:0%
of other states what they can and can't
 
00:42:13.750 --> 00:42:13.760 align:start position:0%
do all the time for example you can't
 
00:42:16.150 --> 00:42:16.160 align:start position:0%
drive in massachusetts without putting
 
00:42:18.870 --> 00:42:18.880 align:start position:0%
your seat belt on
 
00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:19.910 align:start position:0%
your seat belt on
that's

00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:42:21.270 --> 00:42:21.280 align:start position:0%
part of
 
00:42:23.910 --> 00:42:23.920 align:start position:0%
the federal system we have is that
 
00:42:25.990 --> 00:42:26.000 align:start position:0%
various different activities can be
 
00:42:28.470 --> 00:42:28.480 align:start position:0%
controlled in this particular
 
00:42:31.030 --> 00:42:31.040 align:start position:0%
uh situation
 
00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:31.990 align:start position:0%
uh situation
area

00:42:31.990 --> 00:42:32.000 align:start position:0%
area
 
00:42:33.990 --> 00:42:34.000 align:start position:0%
we're telling a state that they can't
 
00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:35.109 align:start position:0%
we're telling a state that they can't
tax

00:42:35.109 --> 00:42:35.119 align:start position:0%
tax
 
00:42:35.119 --> 00:42:36.150 align:start position:0%
tax
somebody

00:42:36.150 --> 00:42:36.160 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
00:42:38.950 --> 00:42:38.960 align:start position:0%
for work that they've done an individual
 
00:42:41.109 --> 00:42:41.119 align:start position:0%
for work that they have done
 
00:42:43.910 --> 00:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
with within the confines of this state
 
00:42:46.630 --> 00:42:46.640 align:start position:0%
even if it is engaged in international
 
00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:47.750 align:start position:0%
even if it is engaged in international
activity

00:42:47.750 --> 00:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
activity
 
00:42:50.150 --> 00:42:50.160 align:start position:0%
i'm kind of reminded of my father who
 
00:42:51.430 --> 00:42:51.440 align:start position:0%
worked for
 
00:42:53.430 --> 00:42:53.440 align:start position:0%
hugh greg more than
 
00:42:56.829 --> 00:42:56.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:56.839 --> 00:42:58.470 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:42:58.470 --> 00:42:58.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:43:00.470 --> 00:43:00.480 align:start position:0%
when they were sold to tripac
 
00:43:02.230 --> 00:43:02.240 align:start position:0%
he was being paid out of pennsylvania
 
00:43:05.190 --> 00:43:05.200 align:start position:0%
which had an income tax
 
00:43:07.109 --> 00:43:07.119 align:start position:0%
but no income tax was taken out because
 
00:43:11.030 --> 00:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:13.589 --> 00:43:13.599 align:start position:0%
it's triangle pacific um what's the name
 
00:43:15.349 --> 00:43:15.359 align:start position:0%
of the company and i think what we're
 
00:43:17.109 --> 00:43:17.119 align:start position:0%
trying to do here is to reassert
 
00:43:20.630 --> 00:43:20.640 align:start position:0%
long-standing irs regulations
 
00:43:22.950 --> 00:43:22.960 align:start position:0%
or rules
 
00:43:24.390 --> 00:43:24.400 align:start position:0%
which state
 
00:43:28.230 --> 00:43:28.240 align:start position:0%
the work done within the state is taxed
 
00:43:30.309 --> 00:43:30.319 align:start position:0%
on is taxed by the state where the work
 
00:43:31.910 --> 00:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
was done
 
00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:33.670 align:start position:0%
was done
not

00:43:33.670 --> 00:43:33.680 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:43:38.069 --> 00:43:38.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:39.829 --> 00:43:39.839 align:start position:0%
what we're saying is if you're doing the
 
00:43:39.839 --> 00:43:41.109 align:start position:0%
what we're saying is if you're doing the
work

00:43:41.109 --> 00:43:41.119 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:43:45.349 --> 00:43:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:48.950 --> 00:43:48.960 align:start position:0%
and maybe for a in this case
 
00:43:51.270 --> 00:43:51.280 align:start position:0%
massachusetts company you still can't
 
00:43:54.230 --> 00:43:54.240 align:start position:0%
tax it because all the work was done in
 
00:43:56.550 --> 00:43:56.560 align:start position:0%
new hampshire even if you were entering
 
00:43:59.990 --> 00:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
it on a spreadsheet that got sent
 
00:44:02.470 --> 00:44:02.480 align:start position:0%
someplace else when you finished doing
 
00:44:05.109 --> 00:44:05.119 align:start position:0%
your analysis of whatever whatever
 
00:44:06.870 --> 00:44:06.880 align:start position:0%
you were doing in that time
 
00:44:09.750 --> 00:44:09.760 align:start position:0%
making sales calls or
 
00:44:12.150 --> 00:44:12.160 align:start position:0%
doing customer service work on an hourly
 
00:44:13.750 --> 00:44:13.760 align:start position:0%
basis or whatever
 
00:44:15.829 --> 00:44:15.839 align:start position:0%
so long as the work was done in new
 
00:44:15.839 --> 00:44:17.030 align:start position:0%
so long as the work was done in new
hampshire

00:44:17.030 --> 00:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:44:19.430 --> 00:44:19.440 align:start position:0%
and i do agree with representative ames
 
00:44:21.190 --> 00:44:21.200 align:start position:0%
that the word may
 
00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:22.710 align:start position:0%
that the word may
um

00:44:22.710 --> 00:44:22.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:23.670 --> 00:44:23.680 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
00:44:26.550 --> 00:44:26.560 align:start position:0%
moves us to nothingness
 
00:44:30.309 --> 00:44:30.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:32.390 --> 00:44:32.400 align:start position:0%
when you say
 
00:44:34.950 --> 00:44:34.960 align:start position:0%
excuse me may not do
 
00:44:36.470 --> 00:44:36.480 align:start position:0%
is one thing
 
00:44:38.470 --> 00:44:38.480 align:start position:0%
but this is not saying that that you may
 
00:44:39.829 --> 00:44:39.839 align:start position:0%
not do
 
00:44:41.030 --> 00:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
it says
 
00:44:44.230 --> 00:44:44.240 align:start position:0%
in this case the word may has its
 
00:44:46.069 --> 00:44:46.079 align:start position:0%
alternative meaning
 
00:44:48.790 --> 00:44:48.800 align:start position:0%
which there's a permissiveness element
 
00:44:51.349 --> 00:44:51.359 align:start position:0%
maybe it can be maybe you can't we don't
 
00:44:53.589 --> 00:44:53.599 align:start position:0%
know we don't care we're gonna
 
00:44:55.510 --> 00:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
that's why it becomes moved because it's
 
00:44:56.710 --> 00:44:56.720 align:start position:0%
not saying
 
00:44:58.790 --> 00:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
you shall not
 
00:45:01.910 --> 00:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
tax and if you try to that gives new
 
00:45:04.870 --> 00:45:04.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire standing to
 
00:45:07.270 --> 00:45:07.280 align:start position:0%
defend the individual against the
 
00:45:10.710 --> 00:45:10.720 align:start position:0%
encroachment of a foreign state
 
00:45:12.790 --> 00:45:12.800 align:start position:0%
thank you sir thank you representative
 
00:45:15.910 --> 00:45:15.920 align:start position:0%
and representative nunes
 
00:45:19.750 --> 00:45:19.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um i read it
 
00:45:21.910 --> 00:45:21.920 align:start position:0%
i read it as if it gives the state of
 
00:45:25.589 --> 00:45:25.599 align:start position:0%
new hampshire the right to defend itself
 
00:45:27.510 --> 00:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
as a sovereign state period that's the
 
00:45:28.790 --> 00:45:28.800 align:start position:0%
way i read it
 
00:45:31.670 --> 00:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
and uh and i would think that that the
 
00:45:34.390 --> 00:45:34.400 align:start position:0%
other two sections that are in there um
 
00:45:35.990 --> 00:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
are only in there as protectionism
 
00:45:38.309 --> 00:45:38.319 align:start position:0%
against those two those those two types
 
00:45:39.430 --> 00:45:39.440 align:start position:0%
of taxes
 
00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:41.829 align:start position:0%
of taxes
um

00:45:41.829 --> 00:45:41.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:43.990 --> 00:45:44.000 align:start position:0%
so if we think about giving uh giving
 
00:45:45.349 --> 00:45:45.359 align:start position:0%
the state the right to defend itself
 
00:45:48.230 --> 00:45:48.240 align:start position:0%
against what i would call an outside tax
 
00:45:50.950 --> 00:45:50.960 align:start position:0%
an outside attack on its tax system then
 
00:45:52.950 --> 00:45:52.960 align:start position:0%
um and maybe we should look at it that
 
00:45:57.030 --> 00:45:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:00.550 --> 00:46:00.560 align:start position:0%
represents uh long
 
00:46:02.470 --> 00:46:02.480 align:start position:0%
lachman thank you
 
00:46:04.390 --> 00:46:04.400 align:start position:0%
i agree with representative uluri about
 
00:46:07.190 --> 00:46:07.200 align:start position:0%
uh the word may taking the teeth right
 
00:46:08.710 --> 00:46:08.720 align:start position:0%
out of it and i think you know we can
 
00:46:10.710 --> 00:46:10.720 align:start position:0%
look to the attorney general making that
 
00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:12.069 align:start position:0%
look to the attorney general making that
suggestion

00:46:12.069 --> 00:46:12.079 align:start position:0%
suggestion
 
00:46:14.470 --> 00:46:14.480 align:start position:0%
um as you know an indication that there
 
00:46:16.069 --> 00:46:16.079 align:start position:0%
is a distinct difference between shall
 
00:46:17.430 --> 00:46:17.440 align:start position:0%
not and may not
 
00:46:19.430 --> 00:46:19.440 align:start position:0%
um i agree with that
 
00:46:21.510 --> 00:46:21.520 align:start position:0%
i think if we want
 
00:46:23.349 --> 00:46:23.359 align:start position:0%
uh a right to defend ourselves if we
 
00:46:26.230 --> 00:46:26.240 align:start position:0%
want the power to uh enforce it we're
 
00:46:27.589 --> 00:46:27.599 align:start position:0%
gonna need a court ruling and if we want
 
00:46:29.349 --> 00:46:29.359 align:start position:0%
a court ruling i agree with
 
00:46:31.349 --> 00:46:31.359 align:start position:0%
representative ames that this would have
 
00:46:33.190 --> 00:46:33.200 align:start position:0%
to have teeth and i think using the word
 
00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:34.230 align:start position:0%
to have teeth and i think using the word
may

00:46:34.230 --> 00:46:34.240 align:start position:0%
may
 
00:46:36.470 --> 00:46:36.480 align:start position:0%
uh nullifies it a little bit i don't
 
00:46:38.470 --> 00:46:38.480 align:start position:0%
think we'll get to that stage with that
 
00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:42.470 align:start position:0%
think we'll get to that stage with that
language

00:46:42.470 --> 00:46:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:43.510 align:start position:0%
 
anybody

00:46:43.510 --> 00:46:43.520 align:start position:0%
anybody
 
00:46:43.520 --> 00:46:46.870 align:start position:0%
anybody
knew

00:46:46.870 --> 00:46:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:48.230 --> 00:46:48.240 align:start position:0%
representative followed by
 
00:46:51.270 --> 00:46:51.280 align:start position:0%
representative spillsbury
 
00:46:52.710 --> 00:46:52.720 align:start position:0%
thank you i
 
00:46:54.790 --> 00:46:54.800 align:start position:0%
do think i think all of us
 
00:46:58.230 --> 00:46:58.240 align:start position:0%
think that this is a really important
 
00:47:01.589 --> 00:47:01.599 align:start position:0%
issue with a very long time horizon at
 
00:47:04.069 --> 00:47:04.079 align:start position:0%
this point well very long
 
00:47:07.910 --> 00:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
maybe two years three years five years
 
00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:09.190 align:start position:0%
maybe two years three years five years
because

00:47:09.190 --> 00:47:09.200 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:47:11.030 --> 00:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
more and more people are going to be
 
00:47:12.790 --> 00:47:12.800 align:start position:0%
going remote
 
00:47:15.510 --> 00:47:15.520 align:start position:0%
and that creates other problems more
 
00:47:17.910 --> 00:47:17.920 align:start position:0%
problems even than the ones that this is
 
00:47:19.430 --> 00:47:19.440 align:start position:0%
trying to address certainly than the
 
00:47:22.710 --> 00:47:22.720 align:start position:0%
very narrow massachusetts law
 
00:47:25.910 --> 00:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:29.589 --> 00:47:29.599 align:start position:0%
and i think that if we want to get this
 
00:47:31.910 --> 00:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
to a point where the supreme court would
 
00:47:33.190 --> 00:47:33.200 align:start position:0%
be forced
 
00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:33.910 align:start position:0%
be forced
to

00:47:33.910 --> 00:47:33.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:47:36.829 --> 00:47:36.839 align:start position:0%
uh the u.s supreme court would be forced
 
00:47:39.990 --> 00:47:40.000 align:start position:0%
to on
 
00:47:42.710 --> 00:47:42.720 align:start position:0%
work with us on this and figure out how
 
00:47:45.030 --> 00:47:45.040 align:start position:0%
to do this nationally we need more
 
00:47:47.829 --> 00:47:47.839 align:start position:0%
allies than just ourselves to try to go
 
00:47:50.069 --> 00:47:50.079 align:start position:0%
there especially
 
00:47:50.079 --> 00:47:52.230 align:start position:0%
there especially
on

00:47:52.230 --> 00:47:52.240 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:47:53.910 --> 00:47:53.920 align:start position:0%
with well
 
00:47:57.030 --> 00:47:57.040 align:start position:0%
especially no just with a bill that one
 
00:47:59.750 --> 00:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
state with an odd tax system
 
00:48:01.670 --> 00:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
uh is asking
 
00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:02.390 align:start position:0%
uh is asking
for

00:48:02.390 --> 00:48:02.400 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:48:06.150 --> 00:48:06.160 align:start position:0%
it is a very odd tax system
 
00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:08.230 align:start position:0%
it is a very odd tax system
would

00:48:08.230 --> 00:48:08.240 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:10.710 align:start position:0%
would
be

00:48:10.710 --> 00:48:10.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:13.670 --> 00:48:13.680 align:start position:0%
asking to have resolved i think that we
 
00:48:18.150 --> 00:48:18.160 align:start position:0%
need the dra needs time to talk with tax
 
00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:20.230 align:start position:0%
need the dra needs time to talk with tax
attorneys

00:48:20.230 --> 00:48:20.240 align:start position:0%
attorneys
 
00:48:20.240 --> 00:48:21.109 align:start position:0%
attorneys
from

00:48:21.109 --> 00:48:21.119 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:48:23.430 --> 00:48:23.440 align:start position:0%
other revenue departments all across the
 
00:48:27.030 --> 00:48:27.040 align:start position:0%
country about this issue
 
00:48:28.950 --> 00:48:28.960 align:start position:0%
of on
 
00:48:31.510 --> 00:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
more and more people living in one place
 
00:48:34.470 --> 00:48:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:36.309 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:48:36.309 --> 00:48:36.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:48:39.270 --> 00:48:39.280 align:start position:0%
try to see if there are allies to bring
 
00:48:39.280 --> 00:48:41.430 align:start position:0%
try to see if there are allies to bring
forward

00:48:41.430 --> 00:48:41.440 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:48:43.430 --> 00:48:43.440 align:start position:0%
forward on
 
00:48:46.230 --> 00:48:46.240 align:start position:0%
something that is going to allow
 
00:48:48.549 --> 00:48:48.559 align:start position:0%
this uh force the supreme court to take
 
00:48:49.990 --> 00:48:50.000 align:start position:0%
up an issue that they probably aren't
 
00:48:51.990 --> 00:48:52.000 align:start position:0%
going to want to take up because it's
 
00:48:54.870 --> 00:48:54.880 align:start position:0%
very very complicated
 
00:48:56.950 --> 00:48:56.960 align:start position:0%
so okay
 
00:48:59.750 --> 00:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
representative spillsbury
 
00:49:01.670 --> 00:49:01.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:49:04.710 --> 00:49:04.720 align:start position:0%
this this of course is a case of people
 
00:49:04.720 --> 00:49:05.750 align:start position:0%
this this of course is a case of people
living

00:49:05.750 --> 00:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
living
 
00:49:07.990 --> 00:49:08.000 align:start position:0%
and working in the same place
 
00:49:10.390 --> 00:49:10.400 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
00:49:11.829 --> 00:49:11.839 align:start position:0%
the essential
 
00:49:13.349 --> 00:49:13.359 align:start position:0%
distinction between the bill is
 
00:49:15.270 --> 00:49:15.280 align:start position:0%
originally drafted
 
00:49:17.750 --> 00:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
and this amendment is that the bills are
 
00:49:19.589 --> 00:49:19.599 align:start position:0%
originally drafted
 
00:49:22.390 --> 00:49:22.400 align:start position:0%
was aimed at massachusetts or any other
 
00:49:24.950 --> 00:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
state that would take a similar position
 
00:49:27.670 --> 00:49:27.680 align:start position:0%
and it's because we don't have the power
 
00:49:28.950 --> 00:49:28.960 align:start position:0%
to control
 
00:49:31.910 --> 00:49:31.920 align:start position:0%
their actions that it got reframed the
 
00:49:33.670 --> 00:49:33.680 align:start position:0%
purpose of it as drafted in the
 
00:49:33.680 --> 00:49:35.510 align:start position:0%
purpose of it as drafted in the
amendment

00:49:35.510 --> 00:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:49:36.710 --> 00:49:36.720 align:start position:0%
is to
 
00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:38.870 align:start position:0%
is to
unequivocally

00:49:38.870 --> 00:49:38.880 align:start position:0%
unequivocally
 
00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:39.910 align:start position:0%
unequivocally
state

00:49:39.910 --> 00:49:39.920 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:49:42.870 --> 00:49:42.880 align:start position:0%
the policy and the sovereign interest
 
00:49:44.790 --> 00:49:44.800 align:start position:0%
so that it can be defended and so i just
 
00:49:46.950 --> 00:49:46.960 align:start position:0%
want to echo representative nunez's
 
00:49:48.790 --> 00:49:48.800 align:start position:0%
comments that the purpose of the
 
00:49:51.030 --> 00:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
amendment is not so much to tell
 
00:49:53.190 --> 00:49:53.200 align:start position:0%
massachusetts what it can and cannot do
 
00:49:55.190 --> 00:49:55.200 align:start position:0%
it's to tell new hampshire
 
00:49:57.030 --> 00:49:57.040 align:start position:0%
that we are going to defend
 
00:49:59.990 --> 00:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
this sovereign interest as as enunciated
 
00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:01.030 align:start position:0%
this sovereign interest as as enunciated
here

00:50:01.030 --> 00:50:01.040 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:50:04.390 --> 00:50:04.400 align:start position:0%
as far as you know may versus shao
 
00:50:06.390 --> 00:50:06.400 align:start position:0%
i don't read it that way but i would be
 
00:50:08.790 --> 00:50:08.800 align:start position:0%
glad to work with the senate to put the
 
00:50:11.750 --> 00:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
word shaolin in place of may and remove
 
00:50:12.710 --> 00:50:12.720 align:start position:0%
all doubt
 
00:50:14.150 --> 00:50:14.160 align:start position:0%
the last comment i just want to make the
 
00:50:15.670 --> 00:50:15.680 align:start position:0%
observation so that the committee is
 
00:50:15.680 --> 00:50:16.790 align:start position:0%
observation so that the committee is
aware

00:50:16.790 --> 00:50:16.800 align:start position:0%
aware
 
00:50:19.190 --> 00:50:19.200 align:start position:0%
that when this language was
 
00:50:22.549 --> 00:50:22.559 align:start position:0%
worked out yesterday morning
 
00:50:24.790 --> 00:50:24.800 align:start position:0%
assistant attorney general sam garland
 
00:50:27.990 --> 00:50:28.000 align:start position:0%
personally took it to reviewed it with
 
00:50:30.309 --> 00:50:30.319 align:start position:0%
attorney general formella and got his
 
00:50:31.750 --> 00:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
sign off
 
00:50:33.750 --> 00:50:33.760 align:start position:0%
so i would like us to go ahead and if
 
00:50:35.430 --> 00:50:35.440 align:start position:0%
there are reservations let's work with
 
00:50:39.030 --> 00:50:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:40.630 --> 00:50:40.640 align:start position:0%
thank you representative spellsbury
 
00:50:42.790 --> 00:50:42.800 align:start position:0%
representing you
 
00:50:44.069 --> 00:50:44.079 align:start position:0%
yes i just want to echo what
 
00:50:46.630 --> 00:50:46.640 align:start position:0%
representative spillsbury just said we
 
00:50:49.109 --> 00:50:49.119 align:start position:0%
the two of us worked with dra and the
 
00:50:51.030 --> 00:50:51.040 align:start position:0%
attorney general's office and
 
00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:52.230 align:start position:0%
attorney general's office and
um

00:50:52.230 --> 00:50:52.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:53.910 --> 00:50:53.920 align:start position:0%
that's absolutely true we worked with
 
00:50:55.829 --> 00:50:55.839 align:start position:0%
sam garland he took it to the attorney
 
00:50:58.069 --> 00:50:58.079 align:start position:0%
general yesterday the attorney general
 
00:50:59.990 --> 00:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
approved of this language so
 
00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:01.670 align:start position:0%
approved of this language so
um

00:51:01.670 --> 00:51:01.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:04.549 --> 00:51:04.559 align:start position:0%
it's i think it's and they would prefer
 
00:51:06.950 --> 00:51:06.960 align:start position:0%
something as to rather than nothing and
 
00:51:08.710 --> 00:51:08.720 align:start position:0%
they would prefer this in case something
 
00:51:11.349 --> 00:51:11.359 align:start position:0%
else comes up they're ready to go
 
00:51:13.109 --> 00:51:13.119 align:start position:0%
and we still have the possibility of
 
00:51:14.790 --> 00:51:14.800 align:start position:0%
improving it further in the senate so i
 
00:51:16.950 --> 00:51:16.960 align:start position:0%
also would say let's uh move ahead with
 
00:51:18.950 --> 00:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
this thank you
 
00:51:21.109 --> 00:51:21.119 align:start position:0%
thank you representation eugene
 
00:51:23.670 --> 00:51:23.680 align:start position:0%
any further questions or comments i have
 
00:51:27.589 --> 00:51:27.599 align:start position:0%
a question for representative ames
 
00:51:29.750 --> 00:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
representative ames from the discussion
 
00:51:32.069 --> 00:51:32.079 align:start position:0%
that we had this morning
 
00:51:36.069 --> 00:51:36.079 align:start position:0%
all the reasons for and and not
 
00:51:38.790 --> 00:51:38.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:40.790 --> 00:51:40.800 align:start position:0%
in your opinion
 
00:51:43.430 --> 00:51:43.440 align:start position:0%
is there a fix
 
00:51:45.829 --> 00:51:45.839 align:start position:0%
that you would like to see immediately
 
00:51:48.069 --> 00:51:48.079 align:start position:0%
that can be addressed immediately
 
00:51:50.470 --> 00:51:50.480 align:start position:0%
because we must exact this today
 
00:51:55.670 --> 00:51:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:57.670 --> 00:51:57.680 align:start position:0%
i'm not prepared to do that right now
 
00:52:00.790 --> 00:52:00.800 align:start position:0%
that's uh this is as has been said by
 
00:52:02.069 --> 00:52:02.079 align:start position:0%
many people
 
00:52:04.470 --> 00:52:04.480 align:start position:0%
complicated it looks simple but it's
 
00:52:06.790 --> 00:52:06.800 align:start position:0%
complicated and uh
 
00:52:08.950 --> 00:52:08.960 align:start position:0%
you know what i i'd love to have the
 
00:52:11.349 --> 00:52:11.359 align:start position:0%
opportunity to do is what we did if
 
00:52:13.270 --> 00:52:13.280 align:start position:0%
you'll recall you were here
 
00:52:15.670 --> 00:52:15.680 align:start position:0%
when we dealt with the uh wayfarer
 
00:52:18.790 --> 00:52:18.800 align:start position:0%
matter and uh if you'll remember
 
00:52:20.630 --> 00:52:20.640 align:start position:0%
those who were around
 
00:52:22.710 --> 00:52:22.720 align:start position:0%
uh that all started in
 
00:52:24.790 --> 00:52:24.800 align:start position:0%
the summer of one year i don't remember
 
00:52:27.750 --> 00:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
which years we're at with a special
 
00:52:30.549 --> 00:52:30.559 align:start position:0%
session on a special committee
 
00:52:32.150 --> 00:52:32.160 align:start position:0%
focus on the bill i was on that
 
00:52:33.990 --> 00:52:34.000 align:start position:0%
committee a number of others
 
00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:35.030 align:start position:0%
committee a number of others
uh

00:52:35.030 --> 00:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:52:38.150 --> 00:52:38.160 align:start position:0%
at then council for the governor
 
00:52:38.160 --> 00:52:38.950 align:start position:0%
at then council for the governor
uh

00:52:38.950 --> 00:52:38.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:52:41.910 --> 00:52:41.920 align:start position:0%
formella was uh a key person and
 
00:52:44.630 --> 00:52:44.640 align:start position:0%
drafting a bill that went before the
 
00:52:47.430 --> 00:52:47.440 align:start position:0%
house and the senate and failed it
 
00:52:50.309 --> 00:52:50.319 align:start position:0%
wasn't ready it wasn't quite right we
 
00:52:52.309 --> 00:52:52.319 align:start position:0%
all reckon well we didn't all recognize
 
00:52:53.829 --> 00:52:53.839 align:start position:0%
it i think the house voted for it but
 
00:52:56.069 --> 00:52:56.079 align:start position:0%
the senate voted it down
 
00:52:58.950 --> 00:52:58.960 align:start position:0%
and then another bill was introduced
 
00:53:01.190 --> 00:53:01.200 align:start position:0%
and i came to this committee
 
00:53:03.190 --> 00:53:03.200 align:start position:0%
and we worked if you'll remember we had
 
00:53:05.670 --> 00:53:05.680 align:start position:0%
several work sessions on that bill
 
00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:06.470 align:start position:0%
several work sessions on that bill
with

00:53:06.470 --> 00:53:06.480 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:53:09.349 --> 00:53:09.359 align:start position:0%
attorney formula and with bill lardinger
 
00:53:11.430 --> 00:53:11.440 align:start position:0%
a well-known tax attorney and
 
00:53:13.750 --> 00:53:13.760 align:start position:0%
constitutional attorney law
 
00:53:15.829 --> 00:53:15.839 align:start position:0%
constitutional law attorney
 
00:53:18.790 --> 00:53:18.800 align:start position:0%
and we made substantial changes in that
 
00:53:21.030 --> 00:53:21.040 align:start position:0%
bill as we work through it the goal
 
00:53:21.040 --> 00:53:22.150 align:start position:0%
bill as we work through it the goal
being

00:53:22.150 --> 00:53:22.160 align:start position:0%
being
 
00:53:24.950 --> 00:53:24.960 align:start position:0%
to set up a system that would enable new
 
00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:26.069 align:start position:0%
to set up a system that would enable new
hampshire

00:53:26.069 --> 00:53:26.079 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:53:28.309 --> 00:53:28.319 align:start position:0%
to go forward to the supreme court much
 
00:53:30.710 --> 00:53:30.720 align:start position:0%
like this bill is being developed
 
00:53:33.270 --> 00:53:33.280 align:start position:0%
uh in a way that could uh make a
 
00:53:35.109 --> 00:53:35.119 align:start position:0%
difference for new hampshire
 
00:53:37.190 --> 00:53:37.200 align:start position:0%
if in fact uh
 
00:53:39.990 --> 00:53:40.000 align:start position:0%
sales tax activity in that case what was
 
00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:41.510 align:start position:0%
sales tax activity in that case what was
involved

00:53:41.510 --> 00:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
involved
 
00:53:43.270 --> 00:53:43.280 align:start position:0%
threatened new hampshire's sovereign
 
00:53:43.280 --> 00:53:44.390 align:start position:0%
threatened new hampshire's sovereign
interests

00:53:44.390 --> 00:53:44.400 align:start position:0%
interests
 
00:53:47.109 --> 00:53:47.119 align:start position:0%
we worked out a good system a good bill
 
00:53:49.190 --> 00:53:49.200 align:start position:0%
we were all happy with that it went
 
00:53:51.349 --> 00:53:51.359 align:start position:0%
through and was enacted but it was
 
00:53:53.589 --> 00:53:53.599 align:start position:0%
substantially different from what came
 
00:53:57.109 --> 00:53:57.119 align:start position:0%
to us that fall that's the kind of work
 
00:53:59.030 --> 00:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
we need in this case and
 
00:54:01.109 --> 00:54:01.119 align:start position:0%
i appreciate that
 
00:54:02.870 --> 00:54:02.880 align:start position:0%
the attorney general now attorney
 
00:54:04.470 --> 00:54:04.480 align:start position:0%
general formula
 
00:54:07.270 --> 00:54:07.280 align:start position:0%
took a look at this and said yes
 
00:54:08.950 --> 00:54:08.960 align:start position:0%
he supported this
 
00:54:11.430 --> 00:54:11.440 align:start position:0%
but that's very different from sitting
 
00:54:11.440 --> 00:54:12.309 align:start position:0%
but that's very different from sitting
down

00:54:12.309 --> 00:54:12.319 align:start position:0%
down
 
00:54:14.150 --> 00:54:14.160 align:start position:0%
working through the complexities and
 
00:54:16.230 --> 00:54:16.240 align:start position:0%
making sure we've got something
 
00:54:18.150 --> 00:54:18.160 align:start position:0%
it's not cheap to go to the supreme
 
00:54:20.390 --> 00:54:20.400 align:start position:0%
court it costs a lot of money
 
00:54:20.400 --> 00:54:21.670 align:start position:0%
court it costs a lot of money
and

00:54:21.670 --> 00:54:21.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:54:24.950 --> 00:54:24.960 align:start position:0%
to go forward with litigation
 
00:54:27.910 --> 00:54:27.920 align:start position:0%
is something you don't do lightly so uh
 
00:54:30.230 --> 00:54:30.240 align:start position:0%
i think you want to go forward with us
 
00:54:33.910 --> 00:54:33.920 align:start position:0%
with litigation with a strong hand and
 
00:54:36.309 --> 00:54:36.319 align:start position:0%
that's the way i'd prefer to do it and
 
00:54:40.150 --> 00:54:40.160 align:start position:0%
not rely on maybe negotiating a fix with
 
00:54:40.160 --> 00:54:41.030 align:start position:0%
not rely on maybe negotiating a fix with
the

00:54:41.030 --> 00:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:54:42.470 --> 00:54:42.480 align:start position:0%
state senate
 
00:54:45.109 --> 00:54:45.119 align:start position:0%
so that's my response to that
 
00:54:47.109 --> 00:54:47.119 align:start position:0%
thank you representative ames we're
 
00:54:48.390 --> 00:54:48.400 align:start position:0%
going to take a
 
00:54:51.510 --> 00:54:51.520 align:start position:0%
five minute recess at this point
 
00:54:53.190 --> 00:54:53.200 align:start position:0%
uh well we're gonna
 
00:54:56.230 --> 00:54:56.240 align:start position:0%
want to caucus i think but i just if i
 
00:54:59.109 --> 00:54:59.119 align:start position:0%
could make a final comment on this
 
00:54:59.119 --> 00:55:00.069 align:start position:0%
could make a final comment on this
on

00:55:00.069 --> 00:55:00.079 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:55:03.349 --> 00:55:03.359 align:start position:0%
what i'm really worried about is that
 
00:55:07.510 --> 00:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
you pass this the way it is which is
 
00:55:10.630 --> 00:55:10.640 align:start position:0%
fairly innocuous because um
 
00:55:13.190 --> 00:55:13.200 align:start position:0%
attorney general formella didn't want to
 
00:55:17.349 --> 00:55:17.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:17.359 --> 00:55:19.190 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:55:19.190 --> 00:55:19.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:55:20.870 --> 00:55:20.880 align:start position:0%
and then we forget about it we don't
 
00:55:23.030 --> 00:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
bother to do anything with it
 
00:55:26.549 --> 00:55:26.559 align:start position:0%
on we do have wayfarer totally set up
 
00:55:27.670 --> 00:55:27.680 align:start position:0%
for when
 
00:55:30.870 --> 00:55:30.880 align:start position:0%
the big state this big sales tax states
 
00:55:35.430 --> 00:55:35.440 align:start position:0%
start going after the smallest sellers
 
00:55:36.470 --> 00:55:36.480 align:start position:0%
in other
 
00:55:36.480 --> 00:55:38.789 align:start position:0%
in other
states

00:55:38.789 --> 00:55:38.799 align:start position:0%
states
 
00:55:40.069 --> 00:55:40.079 align:start position:0%
but and
 
00:55:42.150 --> 00:55:42.160 align:start position:0%
that's why you don't hear much about it
 
00:55:44.870 --> 00:55:44.880 align:start position:0%
today they aren't doing it yet at least
 
00:55:48.230 --> 00:55:48.240 align:start position:0%
that's what the businesses tell us
 
00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:49.750 align:start position:0%
that's what the businesses tell us
and

00:55:49.750 --> 00:55:49.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:55:49.760 --> 00:55:50.950 align:start position:0%
and
but

00:55:50.950 --> 00:55:50.960 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:55:50.960 --> 00:55:51.829 align:start position:0%
but
we

00:55:51.829 --> 00:55:51.839 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:55:54.309 --> 00:55:54.319 align:start position:0%
this is not
 
00:55:57.190 --> 00:55:57.200 align:start position:0%
sufficient to be able to get the supreme
 
00:56:01.190 --> 00:56:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:03.030 --> 00:56:03.040 align:start position:0%
okay we're going to take a
 
00:56:05.829 --> 00:56:05.839 align:start position:0%
five-minute break and uh
 
00:56:07.990 --> 00:56:08.000 align:start position:0%
can we have at least 10 minutes we need
 
00:56:10.150 --> 00:56:10.160 align:start position:0%
to have a caucus
 
00:56:12.150 --> 00:56:12.160 align:start position:0%
we do too
 
00:56:14.789 --> 00:56:14.799 align:start position:0%
15 minutes maybe um
 
00:56:16.549 --> 00:56:16.559 align:start position:0%
we'll be back we'll be back in ten
 
00:56:22.789 --> 00:56:22.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:24.789 --> 00:56:24.799 align:start position:0%
we're gonna go find the room on this
 
00:56:27.349 --> 00:56:27.359 align:start position:0%
floor i think we can when we finish when
 
00:56:30.950 --> 00:56:30.960 align:start position:0%
we finish this we'll have that here
 
00:56:32.789 --> 00:56:32.799 align:start position:0%
okay the republicans want to stay in
 
00:56:32.799 --> 01:13:26.229 align:start position:0%
okay the republicans want to stay in
here

01:13:26.229 --> 01:13:26.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:28.630 --> 01:13:28.640 align:start position:0%
i just want to uh apologize for holding
 
01:13:30.149 --> 01:13:30.159 align:start position:0%
everything up here
 
01:13:32.550 --> 01:13:32.560 align:start position:0%
uh i'll just say we was we're defending
 
01:13:35.030 --> 01:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
the house position in the senate
 
01:13:35.040 --> 01:13:35.830 align:start position:0%
the house position in the senate
so

01:13:35.830 --> 01:13:35.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:13:39.270 --> 01:13:39.280 align:start position:0%

um
 
01:18:20.870 --> 01:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
situation shown a bright light on the
 
01:18:22.390 --> 01:18:22.400 align:start position:0%
issue of
 
01:18:24.149 --> 01:18:24.159 align:start position:0%
other states
 
01:18:26.550 --> 01:18:26.560 align:start position:0%

within the state
 
01:18:30.870 --> 01:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
the state of new york has had this
 
01:18:34.470 --> 01:18:34.480 align:start position:0%
policy in a very aggressive way for many
 
01:18:36.630 --> 01:18:36.640 align:start position:0%
many years and there are many people
 
01:18:38.630 --> 01:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
that work remotely
 
01:18:41.110 --> 01:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
in this state that are associated with
 
01:18:43.110 --> 01:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
new york corporations that have had to
 
01:18:44.950 --> 01:18:44.960 align:start position:0%
pay the income tax
 
01:18:47.590 --> 01:18:47.600 align:start position:0%

01:24:27.189 --> 01:24:27.199 align:start position:0%
i want to speak to your motion on the
 
01:24:30.310 --> 01:24:30.320 align:start position:0%
amendment yeah yes thank you mr chairman
 
01:24:33.510 --> 01:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
so this amendment the original bill
 
01:24:33.520 --> 01:24:34.709 align:start position:0%
so this amendment the original bill
um

01:24:34.709 --> 01:24:34.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:34.719 --> 01:24:35.990 align:start position:0%
um
basically

01:24:35.990 --> 01:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
basically
 
01:24:38.149 --> 01:24:38.159 align:start position:0%
lowered the business profits tax from
 
01:24:41.990 --> 01:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
7.6 percent to 7.5 percent and the bet
 
01:24:43.830 --> 01:24:43.840 align:start position:0%
business enterprise tax
 
01:24:47.430 --> 01:24:47.440 align:start position:0%
from 0.55 to 0.5
 
01:24:50.550 --> 01:24:50.560 align:start position:0%
there was a concern that given the tax
 
01:24:52.470 --> 01:24:52.480 align:start position:0%
cuts in the previous year
 
01:24:53.910 --> 01:24:53.920 align:start position:0%
the um
 
01:24:56.149 --> 01:24:56.159 align:start position:0%
while business profits are up tax
 
01:24:59.030 --> 01:24:59.040 align:start position:0%
revenues to the state are up
 
01:24:59.040 --> 01:25:00.149 align:start position:0%
revenues to the state are up
the

01:25:00.149 --> 01:25:00.159 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:25:02.709 --> 01:25:02.719 align:start position:0%
impact of the ppp loans
 
01:25:04.629 --> 01:25:04.639 align:start position:0%
and the stimulus packages
 
01:25:06.390 --> 01:25:06.400 align:start position:0%
make it a little bit difficult to know
 
01:25:08.149 --> 01:25:08.159 align:start position:0%
exactly where we stand
 
01:25:08.159 --> 01:25:09.430 align:start position:0%
exactly where we stand
so

01:25:09.430 --> 01:25:09.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:25:12.390 --> 01:25:12.400 align:start position:0%
the amendment basically takes out the
 
01:25:15.030 --> 01:25:15.040 align:start position:0%
reduction in the bet tax
 
01:25:16.950 --> 01:25:16.960 align:start position:0%
and moves forward only with the lowering
 
01:25:18.870 --> 01:25:18.880 align:start position:0%
of the bpt tax
 
01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:20.070 align:start position:0%
of the bpt tax
so

01:25:20.070 --> 01:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:25:21.510 --> 01:25:21.520 align:start position:0%
the amendment basically lowers the
 
01:25:25.189 --> 01:25:25.199 align:start position:0%
business profits tax from 7.6 to 7.5
 
01:25:25.199 --> 01:25:26.470 align:start position:0%
business profits tax from 7.6 to 7.5
percent

01:25:26.470 --> 01:25:26.480 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:25:27.669 --> 01:25:27.679 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:25:30.310 --> 01:25:30.320 align:start position:0%
it's it's basically um we become very
 
01:25:31.990 --> 01:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
competitive it was a
 
01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:33.270 align:start position:0%
competitive it was a
um

01:25:33.270 --> 01:25:33.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:35.270 --> 01:25:35.280 align:start position:0%
a goal that was put forth approximately
 
01:25:37.189 --> 01:25:37.199 align:start position:0%
six years ago when
 
01:25:40.790 --> 01:25:40.800 align:start position:0%
the business profits tax was 8.5 it's
 
01:25:42.709 --> 01:25:42.719 align:start position:0%
the goal back then was to get it down to
 
01:25:45.830 --> 01:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
7.5 we are at 7.6 this would be the
 
01:25:47.910 --> 01:25:47.920 align:start position:0%
final 0.1
 
01:25:47.920 --> 01:25:49.030 align:start position:0%
final 0.1
reduction

01:25:49.030 --> 01:25:49.040 align:start position:0%
reduction
 
01:25:51.669 --> 01:25:51.679 align:start position:0%
and we will compare very favorably with
 
01:25:53.510 --> 01:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
our neighbors in massachusetts that have
 
01:25:55.750 --> 01:25:55.760 align:start position:0%
an eight percent business profits tax
 
01:25:58.870 --> 01:25:58.880 align:start position:0%
and our neighbors in vermont whose tax
 
01:26:00.950 --> 01:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
varies between six and eight and a half
 
01:26:02.629 --> 01:26:02.639 align:start position:0%
percent and it gets to eight and a half
 
01:26:04.390 --> 01:26:04.400 align:start position:0%
percent as soon as it's over twenty five
 
01:26:06.790 --> 01:26:06.800 align:start position:0%
thousand so for all practical purposes
 
01:26:09.189 --> 01:26:09.199 align:start position:0%
they would be virtually a percent higher
 
01:26:11.830 --> 01:26:11.840 align:start position:0%
so i would urge um
 
01:26:13.350 --> 01:26:13.360 align:start position:0%
passage of this amendment for those
 
01:26:13.360 --> 01:26:14.550 align:start position:0%
passage of this amendment for those
reasons

01:26:14.550 --> 01:26:14.560 align:start position:0%
reasons
 
01:26:16.149 --> 01:26:16.159 align:start position:0%
further comments on the amendment
 
01:26:16.159 --> 01:26:19.030 align:start position:0%

weeks it's tough to remember any names
 
01:26:26.709 --> 01:26:26.719 align:start position:0%
uh rip uh a question for the
 
01:26:29.750 --> 01:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
representative canadian
 
01:26:31.990 --> 01:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
you said this was a goal
 
01:26:33.510 --> 01:26:33.520 align:start position:0%
you've reached that goal is that the
 
01:26:35.030 --> 01:26:35.040 align:start position:0%
position of the party now not to go
 
01:26:40.629 --> 01:26:40.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:42.470 --> 01:26:42.480 align:start position:0%
i'm not gonna i'm not going to speak to
 
01:26:44.470 --> 01:26:44.480 align:start position:0%
further goals at this point right now
 
01:26:46.870 --> 01:26:46.880 align:start position:0%
this is the this is the goal at hand and
 
01:26:48.310 --> 01:26:48.320 align:start position:0%
this is um
 
01:26:50.709 --> 01:26:50.719 align:start position:0%
what we're what we're uh aiming for
 
01:26:52.550 --> 01:26:52.560 align:start position:0%
thank you sir
 
01:26:53.830 --> 01:26:53.840 align:start position:0%
further questions and comments
 
01:26:55.270 --> 01:26:55.280 align:start position:0%
representative me
 
01:26:57.590 --> 01:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
thank you bye representative
 
01:26:57.600 --> 01:26:58.550 align:start position:0%
thank you bye representative
on

01:26:58.550 --> 01:26:58.560 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:27:00.790 --> 01:27:00.800 align:start position:0%
i would also like to know
 
01:27:00.800 --> 01:27:01.830 align:start position:0%
i would also like to know
uh

01:27:01.830 --> 01:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:27:05.110 --> 01:27:05.120 align:start position:0%
well point out actually on
 
01:27:06.870 --> 01:27:06.880 align:start position:0%
that it is
 
01:27:08.950 --> 01:27:08.960 align:start position:0%
already impossible so this probably
 
01:27:11.830 --> 01:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
won't make it any worse to
 
01:27:14.390 --> 01:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
estimate our revenues because the single
 
01:27:17.110 --> 01:27:17.120 align:start position:0%
sales factor is hitting next year we
 
01:27:18.950 --> 01:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
have no idea what it's going to do
 
01:27:20.950 --> 01:27:20.960 align:start position:0%
except that the largest corporations are
 
01:27:25.110 --> 01:27:25.120 align:start position:0%
probably no longer going to pay bpt
 
01:27:28.629 --> 01:27:28.639 align:start position:0%
and the manufacturing corporations
 
01:27:28.639 --> 01:27:29.910 align:start position:0%
and the manufacturing corporations
on

01:27:29.910 --> 01:27:29.920 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:27:32.070 --> 01:27:32.080 align:start position:0%
and we have a lot of other things that
 
01:27:33.669 --> 01:27:33.679 align:start position:0%
we've done that
 
01:27:35.990 --> 01:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
make it we still don't we'll never know
 
01:27:38.950 --> 01:27:38.960 align:start position:0%
what market-based sourcing did
 
01:27:38.960 --> 01:27:39.910 align:start position:0%
what market-based sourcing did
so

01:27:39.910 --> 01:27:39.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:27:43.189 --> 01:27:43.199 align:start position:0%
we are now in complete i i
 
01:27:46.629 --> 01:27:46.639 align:start position:0%
i just want to tell dra that on
 
01:27:48.550 --> 01:27:48.560 align:start position:0%
that we know you're going to have an
 
01:27:50.390 --> 01:27:50.400 align:start position:0%
impossible time trying to estimate
 
01:27:52.950 --> 01:27:52.960 align:start position:0%
revenues and so are we
 
01:27:56.229 --> 01:27:56.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:56.239 --> 01:27:58.709 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:27:58.709 --> 01:27:58.719 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:28:01.430 --> 01:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um i'd just like to
 
01:28:03.270 --> 01:28:03.280 align:start position:0%
reiterate what i've said in the past two
 
01:28:05.189 --> 01:28:05.199 align:start position:0%
work sessions that you're giving a break
 
01:28:07.110 --> 01:28:07.120 align:start position:0%
to the multinationals
 
01:28:10.070 --> 01:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
and not to our small businesses
 
01:28:12.149 --> 01:28:12.159 align:start position:0%
and the small businesses are the ones
 
01:28:13.669 --> 01:28:13.679 align:start position:0%
that went through hell the last two
 
01:28:17.510 --> 01:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:19.830 --> 01:28:19.840 align:start position:0%
and i realized the impact on revenue is
 
01:28:22.669 --> 01:28:22.679 align:start position:0%
greater giving that
 
01:28:22.679 --> 01:28:24.629 align:start position:0%
greater giving that
0.05

01:28:24.629 --> 01:28:24.639 align:start position:0%
0.05
 
01:28:27.430 --> 01:28:27.440 align:start position:0%
reduction to the small businesses
 
01:28:29.990 --> 01:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
versus the 0.1 percent to the bigger
 
01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:31.669 align:start position:0%
versus the 0.1 percent to the bigger
businesses

01:28:31.669 --> 01:28:31.679 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
01:28:31.679 --> 01:28:32.629 align:start position:0%
businesses
but

01:28:32.629 --> 01:28:32.639 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:28:34.310 --> 01:28:34.320 align:start position:0%
i think the dollars that are saved by
 
01:28:35.990 --> 01:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
those smaller businesses will stay here
 
01:28:37.590 --> 01:28:37.600 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire versus what you're
 
01:28:40.310 --> 01:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
giving to the big businesses that
 
01:28:42.709 --> 01:28:42.719 align:start position:0%
have admitted they don't always notice
 
01:28:43.990 --> 01:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
what they're paying for their business
 
01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:45.110 align:start position:0%
what they're paying for their business
taxes

01:28:45.110 --> 01:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
01:28:46.870 --> 01:28:46.880 align:start position:0%
so are they going to notice their 0.1
 
01:28:48.870 --> 01:28:48.880 align:start position:0%
percent reduction whereas a small
 
01:28:50.470 --> 01:28:50.480 align:start position:0%
business in new hampshire
 
01:28:53.830 --> 01:28:53.840 align:start position:0%
would notice their 0.05 reduction
 
01:28:53.840 --> 01:28:54.830 align:start position:0%
would notice their 0.05 reduction
thank

01:28:54.830 --> 01:28:54.840 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:28:58.149 --> 01:28:58.159 align:start position:0%
you further comments
 
01:29:00.149 --> 01:29:00.159 align:start position:0%
representative elmi i mean
 
01:29:03.669 --> 01:29:03.679 align:start position:0%
romney followed by representation
 
01:29:05.270 --> 01:29:05.280 align:start position:0%
i just want to i just want to speak for
 
01:29:07.990 --> 01:29:08.000 align:start position:0%
the majority caucus here
 
01:29:09.830 --> 01:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
that i think this caucus has shown a lot
 
01:29:11.590 --> 01:29:11.600 align:start position:0%
of restraint this year we had an
 
01:29:13.510 --> 01:29:13.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity to
 
01:29:13.520 --> 01:29:14.629 align:start position:0%
opportunity to
to

01:29:14.629 --> 01:29:14.639 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:29:16.709 --> 01:29:16.719 align:start position:0%
get rid of the car rental tax
 
01:29:18.550 --> 01:29:18.560 align:start position:0%
we chose not to
 
01:29:19.750 --> 01:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
we had a chance to get rid of the
 
01:29:21.430 --> 01:29:21.440 align:start position:0%
communication tax
 
01:29:23.350 --> 01:29:23.360 align:start position:0%
we chose not to
 
01:29:25.830 --> 01:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
and we also had a chance to lower the
 
01:29:29.189 --> 01:29:29.199 align:start position:0%
bet tax and we chose not to
 
01:29:29.199 --> 01:29:29.910 align:start position:0%
bet tax and we chose not to
so

01:29:29.910 --> 01:29:29.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:29:32.070 --> 01:29:32.080 align:start position:0%
i think we're being very prudent
 
01:29:33.669 --> 01:29:33.679 align:start position:0%
this this is not
 
01:29:36.310 --> 01:29:36.320 align:start position:0%
uh the reason we this was a goal from
 
01:29:39.270 --> 01:29:39.280 align:start position:0%
years ago that we i think symbolically
 
01:29:40.550 --> 01:29:40.560 align:start position:0%
is important
 
01:29:43.270 --> 01:29:43.280 align:start position:0%
to to get this tax down to 7.5 percent
 
01:29:44.790 --> 01:29:44.800 align:start position:0%
and it's only going to cost i think i
 
01:29:45.910 --> 01:29:45.920 align:start position:0%
don't have the
 
01:29:48.950 --> 01:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
i think it's is it 8 million 8 million
 
01:29:50.550 --> 01:29:50.560 align:start position:0%
right but
 
01:29:52.709 --> 01:29:52.719 align:start position:0%
we understand representative uh the
 
01:29:54.310 --> 01:29:54.320 align:start position:0%
minority leader
 
01:29:54.320 --> 01:29:55.350 align:start position:0%
minority leader
position

01:29:55.350 --> 01:29:55.360 align:start position:0%
position
 
01:29:57.350 --> 01:29:57.360 align:start position:0%
about and we we understand all the
 
01:29:59.189 --> 01:29:59.199 align:start position:0%
things you mentioned and we that's why
 
01:30:00.870 --> 01:30:00.880 align:start position:0%
we've shown restraint
 
01:30:02.470 --> 01:30:02.480 align:start position:0%
and not not lowering some of these other
 
01:30:05.270 --> 01:30:05.280 align:start position:0%
taxes at this point in time thank you
 
01:30:05.280 --> 01:30:07.990 align:start position:0%
taxes at this point in time thank you
representative

01:30:07.990 --> 01:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:09.830 --> 01:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman yeah i would just
 
01:30:12.390 --> 01:30:12.400 align:start position:0%
like to make the point that the uh the
 
01:30:16.790 --> 01:30:16.800 align:start position:0%
bpt tax and the bet tax are paid by both
 
01:30:19.510 --> 01:30:19.520 align:start position:0%
businesses both large and small
 
01:30:20.950 --> 01:30:20.960 align:start position:0%
it's not as though
 
01:30:23.270 --> 01:30:23.280 align:start position:0%
somehow the big businesses avoid the be
 
01:30:25.350 --> 01:30:25.360 align:start position:0%
tax so
 
01:30:28.310 --> 01:30:28.320 align:start position:0%
this is a this is a tax lowering
 
01:30:31.910 --> 01:30:31.920 align:start position:0%
to 7.5 will help small business as well
 
01:30:33.430 --> 01:30:33.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:30:36.629 --> 01:30:36.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:38.790 --> 01:30:38.800 align:start position:0%
yeah i just want to
 
01:30:38.800 --> 01:30:40.310 align:start position:0%
yeah i just want to
well

01:30:40.310 --> 01:30:40.320 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:30:43.030 --> 01:30:43.040 align:start position:0%
first i i want to uh uh
 
01:30:45.430 --> 01:30:45.440 align:start position:0%
acknowledge representative romney's
 
01:30:49.510 --> 01:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
point that the majority has shown
 
01:30:51.590 --> 01:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
shown restraint
 
01:30:53.189 --> 01:30:53.199 align:start position:0%
dealing with
 
01:30:55.510 --> 01:30:55.520 align:start position:0%
bills that call for
 
01:30:58.229 --> 01:30:58.239 align:start position:0%
tax cuts in this
 
01:30:58.239 --> 01:31:00.390 align:start position:0%
tax cuts in this
year's

01:31:00.390 --> 01:31:00.400 align:start position:0%
year's
 
01:31:03.189 --> 01:31:03.199 align:start position:0%
work on bills so i appreciate that but
 
01:31:05.189 --> 01:31:05.199 align:start position:0%
nonetheless we are faced with a bill
 
01:31:06.790 --> 01:31:06.800 align:start position:0%
that does
 
01:31:06.800 --> 01:31:07.910 align:start position:0%
that does
uh

01:31:07.910 --> 01:31:07.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:31:10.709 --> 01:31:10.719 align:start position:0%
add another increment to the cuts and
 
01:31:13.030 --> 01:31:13.040 align:start position:0%
taxes that have been made
 
01:31:16.310 --> 01:31:16.320 align:start position:0%
of about 8 million once it gets up to
 
01:31:18.390 --> 01:31:18.400 align:start position:0%
full speed uh
 
01:31:20.709 --> 01:31:20.719 align:start position:0%
per year and uh
 
01:31:20.719 --> 01:31:22.070 align:start position:0%
per year and uh
that's

01:31:22.070 --> 01:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:31:24.870 --> 01:31:24.880 align:start position:0%
a significant amount of money uh when
 
01:31:28.310 --> 01:31:28.320 align:start position:0%
added to all the other amounts of money
 
01:31:30.550 --> 01:31:30.560 align:start position:0%
that are
 
01:31:31.590 --> 01:31:31.600 align:start position:0%
that are
 
01:31:34.790 --> 01:31:34.800 align:start position:0%
lost through the other cuts
 
01:31:34.800 --> 01:31:36.870 align:start position:0%
lost through the other cuts
and

01:31:36.870 --> 01:31:36.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:31:38.870 --> 01:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
this effort needs to be
 
01:31:41.590 --> 01:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
viewed in the context of uh
 
01:31:43.990 --> 01:31:44.000 align:start position:0%
what's happening on the property tax
 
01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:45.030 align:start position:0%
what's happening on the property tax
front

01:31:45.030 --> 01:31:45.040 align:start position:0%
front
 
01:31:47.510 --> 01:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
we have to look at all taxes
 
01:31:50.070 --> 01:31:50.080 align:start position:0%
and uh although it's uneven and that's
 
01:31:53.189 --> 01:31:53.199 align:start position:0%
why i think each of us sees a different
 
01:31:55.110 --> 01:31:55.120 align:start position:0%
uh picture
 
01:31:56.950 --> 01:31:56.960 align:start position:0%
you look at it from where you sit and
 
01:31:58.950 --> 01:31:58.960 align:start position:0%
stand and live
 
01:32:00.550 --> 01:32:00.560 align:start position:0%
so if you're in a
 
01:32:02.709 --> 01:32:02.719 align:start position:0%
town that's
 
01:32:02.719 --> 01:32:04.390 align:start position:0%
town that's
got

01:32:04.390 --> 01:32:04.400 align:start position:0%
got
 
01:32:07.430 --> 01:32:07.440 align:start position:0%
a high property to property taxable
 
01:32:07.440 --> 01:32:08.550 align:start position:0%
a high property to property taxable
wealth

01:32:08.550 --> 01:32:08.560 align:start position:0%
wealth
 
01:32:10.790 --> 01:32:10.800 align:start position:0%
you're likely going to have low property
 
01:32:13.430 --> 01:32:13.440 align:start position:0%
taxes and maybe even have benefited in
 
01:32:16.229 --> 01:32:16.239 align:start position:0%
the last two years from the
 
01:32:18.470 --> 01:32:18.480 align:start position:0%
efforts that have been made to send
 
01:32:20.629 --> 01:32:20.639 align:start position:0%
money down to municipalities but if
 
01:32:23.030 --> 01:32:23.040 align:start position:0%
you're in a low property wealth
 
01:32:26.149 --> 01:32:26.159 align:start position:0%
town and some of us are
 
01:32:28.390 --> 01:32:28.400 align:start position:0%
we've seen a different picture and our
 
01:32:31.430 --> 01:32:31.440 align:start position:0%
businesses and our residential owner our
 
01:32:33.910 --> 01:32:33.920 align:start position:0%
owners of uh homes
 
01:32:37.110 --> 01:32:37.120 align:start position:0%
are facing property tax increases
 
01:32:37.120 --> 01:32:38.870 align:start position:0%
are facing property tax increases
that

01:32:38.870 --> 01:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:32:38.880 --> 01:32:39.750 align:start position:0%
that
that

01:32:39.750 --> 01:32:39.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:32:42.709 --> 01:32:42.719 align:start position:0%
i'd say without exaggeration in some
 
01:32:44.709 --> 01:32:44.719 align:start position:0%
cases dwarf
 
01:32:46.629 --> 01:32:46.639 align:start position:0%
the business tax
 
01:32:46.639 --> 01:32:48.229 align:start position:0%
the business tax
cuts

01:32:48.229 --> 01:32:48.239 align:start position:0%
cuts
 
01:32:48.239 --> 01:32:49.270 align:start position:0%
cuts
uh

01:32:49.270 --> 01:32:49.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:32:52.390 --> 01:32:52.400 align:start position:0%
just uh a couple of days ago
 
01:32:56.149 --> 01:32:56.159 align:start position:0%
last friday uh at the
 
01:32:59.110 --> 01:32:59.120 align:start position:0%
forum economic forum that
 
01:33:01.510 --> 01:33:01.520 align:start position:0%
was convened by representative major and
 
01:33:01.520 --> 01:33:02.629 align:start position:0%
was convened by representative major and
others

01:33:02.629 --> 01:33:02.639 align:start position:0%
others
 
01:33:05.990 --> 01:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
uh a business owner from jeffrey from my
 
01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:07.030 align:start position:0%
uh a business owner from jeffrey from my
town

01:33:07.030 --> 01:33:07.040 align:start position:0%
town
 
01:33:09.910 --> 01:33:09.920 align:start position:0%
spoke and when asked
 
01:33:12.390 --> 01:33:12.400 align:start position:0%
said that what he worries about when he
 
01:33:15.350 --> 01:33:15.360 align:start position:0%
looks at earth property tax
 
01:33:18.790 --> 01:33:18.800 align:start position:0%
uh consequences and costs
 
01:33:20.709 --> 01:33:20.719 align:start position:0%
and that the business tax really isn't
 
01:33:23.750 --> 01:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
something he he pays much attention to
 
01:33:27.990 --> 01:33:28.000 align:start position:0%
he runs a manufacturing facility small
 
01:33:30.390 --> 01:33:30.400 align:start position:0%
that's his perspective
 
01:33:32.390 --> 01:33:32.400 align:start position:0%
so we're cutting the wrong tax we should
 
01:33:32.400 --> 01:33:33.669 align:start position:0%
so we're cutting the wrong tax we should
be

01:33:33.669 --> 01:33:33.679 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:33:36.870 --> 01:33:36.880 align:start position:0%
thinking about uh state aid to
 
01:33:39.430 --> 01:33:39.440 align:start position:0%
school districts and
 
01:33:41.350 --> 01:33:41.360 align:start position:0%
towns that really need it making sure
 
01:33:43.669 --> 01:33:43.679 align:start position:0%
we've got formulas that send it to the
 
01:33:45.189 --> 01:33:45.199 align:start position:0%
right place
 
01:33:47.590 --> 01:33:47.600 align:start position:0%
and i think a bill like this it's just
 
01:33:49.590 --> 01:33:49.600 align:start position:0%
an increment but it's eight million
 
01:33:52.310 --> 01:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
dollars goes in the wrong direction and
 
01:33:53.750 --> 01:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
so that's why i'm going to vote against
 
01:33:53.760 --> 01:33:55.430 align:start position:0%
so that's why i'm going to vote against
it

01:33:55.430 --> 01:33:55.440 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:33:57.430 --> 01:33:57.440 align:start position:0%
thank you representatives any further
 
01:34:00.550 --> 01:34:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:02.070 --> 01:34:02.080 align:start position:0%
representative romney
 
01:34:03.669 --> 01:34:03.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
01:34:04.709 --> 01:34:04.719 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:34:06.870 --> 01:34:06.880 align:start position:0%
this this past budget
 
01:34:08.310 --> 01:34:08.320 align:start position:0%
they were let me mention two things that
 
01:34:11.350 --> 01:34:11.360 align:start position:0%
we did in that budget first
 
01:34:15.189 --> 01:34:15.199 align:start position:0%
for for years the state aid to the towns
 
01:34:16.870 --> 01:34:16.880 align:start position:0%
was in the
 
01:34:19.430 --> 01:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
low 20s
 
01:34:21.510 --> 01:34:21.520 align:start position:0%
this year in the budget
 
01:34:23.430 --> 01:34:23.440 align:start position:0%
we had to compromise we've increased it
 
01:34:23.440 --> 01:34:24.310 align:start position:0%
we had to compromise we've increased it
to

01:34:24.310 --> 01:34:24.320 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:34:26.629 --> 01:34:26.639 align:start position:0%
30 percent so the towns are going to get
 
01:34:29.189 --> 01:34:29.199 align:start position:0%
more more stated than they ever have
 
01:34:29.199 --> 01:34:30.550 align:start position:0%
more more stated than they ever have
before

01:34:30.550 --> 01:34:30.560 align:start position:0%
before
 
01:34:32.709 --> 01:34:32.719 align:start position:0%
some wanted to be 40. i was actually a
 
01:34:34.950 --> 01:34:34.960 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor for the bill to make it 40
 
01:34:38.390 --> 01:34:38.400 align:start position:0%
but the compromise was was 30
 
01:34:40.629 --> 01:34:40.639 align:start position:0%
then we did something rather unique in
 
01:34:42.709 --> 01:34:42.719 align:start position:0%
the second year of the budget
 
01:34:45.189 --> 01:34:45.199 align:start position:0%
is that we took 100 million dollars
 
01:34:47.430 --> 01:34:47.440 align:start position:0%
because we had such a surplus
 
01:34:48.950 --> 01:34:48.960 align:start position:0%
we wanted to make sure there was true
 
01:34:51.669 --> 01:34:51.679 align:start position:0%
tax relief to the to taxpayers property
 
01:34:54.470 --> 01:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
taxpayers we took 100 million dollars
 
01:34:56.550 --> 01:34:56.560 align:start position:0%
and we put that over from the general
 
01:34:59.030 --> 01:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
fund into the education trust fund
 
01:35:01.030 --> 01:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
but when the dra
 
01:35:03.590 --> 01:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
did their calculation instead of the
 
01:35:06.390 --> 01:35:06.400 align:start position:0%
three 361 million
 
01:35:07.669 --> 01:35:07.679 align:start position:0%
that's swept
 
01:35:10.709 --> 01:35:10.719 align:start position:0%
they're basing that calculation on 261.
 
01:35:12.550 --> 01:35:12.560 align:start position:0%
and that guarantees that everybody's
 
01:35:14.550 --> 01:35:14.560 align:start position:0%
it's not big number when you when you
 
01:35:16.229 --> 01:35:16.239 align:start position:0%
look at all the communities but it's
 
01:35:17.510 --> 01:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
still something
 
01:35:20.950 --> 01:35:20.960 align:start position:0%
that we did to reduce property tax rates
 
01:35:23.590 --> 01:35:23.600 align:start position:0%
for for folks so we're trying
 
01:35:23.600 --> 01:35:24.470 align:start position:0%
for for folks so we're trying
uh

01:35:24.470 --> 01:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:35:27.350 --> 01:35:27.360 align:start position:0%
and yes we have a ways to go to try to
 
01:35:30.550 --> 01:35:30.560 align:start position:0%
find ways to continue to do that
 
01:35:30.560 --> 01:35:31.750 align:start position:0%
find ways to continue to do that
but

01:35:31.750 --> 01:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:35:34.310 --> 01:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
that last way was unique in that we made
 
01:35:36.870 --> 01:35:36.880 align:start position:0%
sure that that money
 
01:35:38.470 --> 01:35:38.480 align:start position:0%
went back to
 
01:35:38.480 --> 01:35:39.270 align:start position:0%

the school districts that had the most
 
01:36:02.470 --> 01:36:02.480 align:start position:0%
the highest
 
01:36:04.149 --> 01:36:04.159 align:start position:0%

most
 
01:36:13.830 --> 01:36:13.840 align:start position:0%
this hundred million went to the
 
01:36:16.470 --> 01:36:16.480 align:start position:0%
communities which had the greatest
 
01:36:18.470 --> 01:36:18.480 align:start position:0%

on my
 
01:36:26.629 --> 01:36:26.639 align:start position:0%
community of lebanon
 
01:36:26.639 --> 01:36:29.109 align:start position:0%
community of lebanon
has

01:36:29.109 --> 01:36:29.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:30.790 --> 01:36:30.800 align:start position:0%
a huge
 
01:36:33.350 --> 01:36:33.360 align:start position:0%
amount of
 
01:36:36.470 --> 01:36:36.480 align:start position:0%
commercial property industrial property
 
01:36:38.709 --> 01:36:38.719 align:start position:0%
and um and
 
01:36:40.550 --> 01:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
our housing prices are going up but
 
01:36:42.629 --> 01:36:42.639 align:start position:0%
they're nowhere near hanovers
 
01:36:42.639 --> 01:36:43.510 align:start position:0%
they're nowhere near hanovers
uh

01:36:43.510 --> 01:36:43.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:36:43.520 --> 01:36:44.629 align:start position:0%
uh
and

01:36:44.629 --> 01:36:44.639 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:36:49.189 --> 01:36:49.199 align:start position:0%
on our property taxes are
 
01:36:52.070 --> 01:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
pretty high but because of that wealth
 
01:36:54.470 --> 01:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
we balanced out this year
 
01:36:56.550 --> 01:36:56.560 align:start position:0%
people aren't noticing that when they
 
01:36:57.669 --> 01:36:57.679 align:start position:0%
they are
 
01:37:01.430 --> 01:37:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:01.440 --> 01:37:02.790 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:37:02.790 --> 01:37:02.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:37:02.800 --> 01:37:03.750 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:37:03.750 --> 01:37:03.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:06.709 --> 01:37:06.719 align:start position:0%
but the communities around me
 
01:37:09.030 --> 01:37:09.040 align:start position:0%
have our bedroom communities they have a
 
01:37:10.709 --> 01:37:10.719 align:start position:0%
lot less
 
01:37:14.550 --> 01:37:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:17.830 --> 01:37:17.840 align:start position:0%
only hanover is wealthy but on
 
01:37:21.669 --> 01:37:21.679 align:start position:0%

01:37:22.870 --> 01:37:22.880 align:start position:0%
low and middle
 
01:37:22.880 --> 01:37:24.390 align:start position:0%
low and middle

mostly and they
 
01:37:28.709 --> 01:37:28.719 align:start position:0%
they suffer more and of course claremont
 
01:37:31.189 --> 01:37:31.199 align:start position:0%

01:43:43.510 --> 01:43:43.520 align:start position:0%
taken up and
 
01:43:45.430 --> 01:43:45.440 align:start position:0%
representative schomburg representative
 
01:43:45.440 --> 01:43:46.390 align:start position:0%

01:43:46.390 --> 01:43:46.400 align:start position:0%

01:43:48.390 --> 01:43:48.400 align:start position:0%
you're a delight to work with
 
01:43:48.400 --> 01:43:49.270 align:start position:0%
you're a delight to work with
so

01:43:49.270 --> 01:43:49.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:43:52.790 --> 01:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
i have appreciated that this has been
 
01:43:54.709 --> 01:43:54.719 align:start position:0%
something that we've discussed a fair
 
01:43:54.719 --> 01:43:55.430 align:start position:0%
something that we've discussed a fair
bit

01:43:55.430 --> 01:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
bit
 
01:43:57.350 --> 01:43:57.360 align:start position:0%
outside of committee session
 
01:44:00.229 --> 01:44:00.239 align:start position:0%
and certainly was my hope
 
01:44:00.239 --> 01:44:01.270 align:start position:0%
and certainly was my hope
to

01:44:01.270 --> 01:44:01.280 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:44:04.229 --> 01:44:04.239 align:start position:0%
clarify any critiques that i had made
 
01:44:05.430 --> 01:44:05.440 align:start position:0%
and to
 
01:44:07.510 --> 01:44:07.520 align:start position:0%
give you know full opportunity for them
 
01:44:09.750 --> 01:44:09.760 align:start position:0%
to be addressed and in fact i think that
 
01:44:11.270 --> 01:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
through four amendments there have been
 
01:44:14.229 --> 01:44:14.239 align:start position:0%
steady improvements the bill is
 
01:44:16.470 --> 01:44:16.480 align:start position:0%
far better off um
 
01:44:18.870 --> 01:44:18.880 align:start position:0%
with the most recent
 
01:44:20.870 --> 01:44:20.880 align:start position:0%
amendment from representative murphy and
 
01:44:22.310 --> 01:44:22.320 align:start position:0%
i would suggest
 
01:44:25.510 --> 01:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
that regardless of the final outcome on
 
01:44:26.790 --> 01:44:26.800 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:44:28.790 --> 01:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
that we should adopt the amendments so
 
01:44:33.109 --> 01:44:33.119 align:start position:0%
that the bill is in its best position
 
01:44:33.119 --> 01:44:34.709 align:start position:0%
that the bill is in its best position
nevertheless

01:44:34.709 --> 01:44:34.719 align:start position:0%
nevertheless
 
01:44:36.550 --> 01:44:36.560 align:start position:0%
i think the bill still has
 
01:44:37.910 --> 01:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
some serious
 
01:44:37.920 --> 01:44:39.030 align:start position:0%
some serious
flaws

01:44:39.030 --> 01:44:39.040 align:start position:0%
flaws
 
01:44:41.590 --> 01:44:41.600 align:start position:0%
and and i say this with full respect to
 
01:44:41.600 --> 01:44:42.550 align:start position:0%
and and i say this with full respect to
the

01:44:42.550 --> 01:44:42.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:44:45.030 --> 01:44:45.040 align:start position:0%
quality of those individuals who choose
 
01:44:47.270 --> 01:44:47.280 align:start position:0%
to serve in the peace corps and
 
01:44:49.830 --> 01:44:49.840 align:start position:0%
americorps and
 
01:44:51.189 --> 01:44:51.199 align:start position:0%
to use the term of the bill
 
01:44:53.109 --> 01:44:53.119 align:start position:0%
satisfactorily complete their terms of
 
01:44:53.119 --> 01:44:55.430 align:start position:0%
satisfactorily complete their terms of
service

01:44:55.430 --> 01:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
service
 
01:44:56.709 --> 01:44:56.719 align:start position:0%
they of course
 
01:44:59.109 --> 01:44:59.119 align:start position:0%
have an arrangement
 
01:45:01.109 --> 01:45:01.119 align:start position:0%
through that program
 
01:45:01.119 --> 01:45:03.109 align:start position:0%
through that program
stipend

01:45:03.109 --> 01:45:03.119 align:start position:0%
stipend
 
01:45:05.189 --> 01:45:05.199 align:start position:0%
they get an enormous amount of valuable
 
01:45:07.830 --> 01:45:07.840 align:start position:0%
experience from a work
 
01:45:09.830 --> 01:45:09.840 align:start position:0%
force development perspective
 
01:45:12.629 --> 01:45:12.639 align:start position:0%
i believe that they emerge from their
 
01:45:14.550 --> 01:45:14.560 align:start position:0%
two years in peace corps of their year
 
01:45:14.560 --> 01:45:15.590 align:start position:0%
two years in peace corps of their year
in

01:45:15.590 --> 01:45:15.600 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:45:18.790 --> 01:45:18.800 align:start position:0%
in americorps um much better positioned
 
01:45:20.790 --> 01:45:20.800 align:start position:0%
to join the workforce
 
01:45:22.550 --> 01:45:22.560 align:start position:0%
so there's a there's certainly a
 
01:45:24.870 --> 01:45:24.880 align:start position:0%
sympathetic position behind the bill in
 
01:45:26.950 --> 01:45:26.960 align:start position:0%
terms of supporting those who go on for
 
01:45:28.550 --> 01:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
further education or those who seek
 
01:45:31.830 --> 01:45:31.840 align:start position:0%
employment and i understand that it's a
 
01:45:33.830 --> 01:45:33.840 align:start position:0%
principally a retention program for
 
01:45:36.470 --> 01:45:36.480 align:start position:0%
out-of-state employees
 
01:45:39.510 --> 01:45:39.520 align:start position:0%
but it still lacks a lot in terms of
 
01:45:41.430 --> 01:45:41.440 align:start position:0%
describing the mechanics it's not clear
 
01:45:44.390 --> 01:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
to me what action it is that the
 
01:45:46.229 --> 01:45:46.239 align:start position:0%
educational institution
 
01:45:48.709 --> 01:45:48.719 align:start position:0%
or the employer
 
01:45:51.910 --> 01:45:51.920 align:start position:0%
has to take to and to trigger the match
 
01:45:53.990 --> 01:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
or how it's demonstrated
 
01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:54.950 align:start position:0%
or how it's demonstrated
uh

01:45:54.950 --> 01:45:54.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:45:56.950 --> 01:45:56.960 align:start position:0%
it's been clarified
 
01:45:59.510 --> 01:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
that the
 
01:45:59.520 --> 01:46:00.950 align:start position:0%
that the
amount

01:46:00.950 --> 01:46:00.960 align:start position:0%
amount
 
01:46:03.189 --> 01:46:03.199 align:start position:0%
of up to three thousand and potentially
 
01:46:05.669 --> 01:46:05.679 align:start position:0%
six thousand is based on per term of
 
01:46:05.679 --> 01:46:06.950 align:start position:0%
six thousand is based on per term of
service

01:46:06.950 --> 01:46:06.960 align:start position:0%
service
 
01:46:08.709 --> 01:46:08.719 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in the bill that
 
01:46:11.189 --> 01:46:11.199 align:start position:0%
indicates how these payments are
 
01:46:14.629 --> 01:46:14.639 align:start position:0%
extended in relation to terms of study
 
01:46:17.430 --> 01:46:17.440 align:start position:0%
whether that's a semester or a year or
 
01:46:19.189 --> 01:46:19.199 align:start position:0%
a multi-year program
 
01:46:21.189 --> 01:46:21.199 align:start position:0%
there's no criteria
 
01:46:23.510 --> 01:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
really for
 
01:46:25.510 --> 01:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
the the variance
 
01:46:29.109 --> 01:46:29.119 align:start position:0%
in discretion of granting 300 to 3 000
 
01:46:31.109 --> 01:46:31.119 align:start position:0%
unless perhaps it's meant that that
 
01:46:33.189 --> 01:46:33.199 align:start position:0%
depends entirely on
 
01:46:35.590 --> 01:46:35.600 align:start position:0%
how much is being matched that's not
 
01:46:36.870 --> 01:46:36.880 align:start position:0%
even clear
 
01:46:38.470 --> 01:46:38.480 align:start position:0%
i think one of the other
 
01:46:41.830 --> 01:46:41.840 align:start position:0%
unfortunate things in the bill is that
 
01:46:43.830 --> 01:46:43.840 align:start position:0%
it's been represented as a three-year
 
01:46:43.840 --> 01:46:44.950 align:start position:0%
it's been represented as a three-year
pilot

01:46:44.950 --> 01:46:44.960 align:start position:0%
pilot
 
01:46:44.960 --> 01:46:46.149 align:start position:0%
pilot
um

01:46:46.149 --> 01:46:46.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:49.030 --> 01:46:49.040 align:start position:0%
program but there's no sunset
 
01:46:52.229 --> 01:46:52.239 align:start position:0%
it's been represented as requiring 750
 
01:46:54.229 --> 01:46:54.239 align:start position:0%
000 over three years at two hundred
 
01:46:55.910 --> 01:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
fifty thousand a year
 
01:46:58.229 --> 01:46:58.239 align:start position:0%
but it seeks to uh
 
01:46:59.910 --> 01:46:59.920 align:start position:0%
uh have seven hundred fifty thousand
 
01:47:01.910 --> 01:47:01.920 align:start position:0%
dollars of funds set aside all at once
 
01:47:04.629 --> 01:47:04.639 align:start position:0%
in fy23
 
01:47:07.669 --> 01:47:07.679 align:start position:0%
which is unbudgeted of course
 
01:47:07.679 --> 01:47:09.350 align:start position:0%
which is unbudgeted of course
and

01:47:09.350 --> 01:47:09.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:47:11.750 --> 01:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
it it seems to me the way it's written
 
01:47:14.470 --> 01:47:14.480 align:start position:0%
that it suggests to the governor that he
 
01:47:15.990 --> 01:47:16.000 align:start position:0%
might look to see if there's available
 
01:47:17.590 --> 01:47:17.600 align:start position:0%
our upper funds but it doesn't require
 
01:47:19.270 --> 01:47:19.280 align:start position:0%
him to find the funds there
 
01:47:22.470 --> 01:47:22.480 align:start position:0%
therefore it appears to me to be a
 
01:47:26.629 --> 01:47:26.639 align:start position:0%
unbudgeted unappropriated
 
01:47:29.189 --> 01:47:29.199 align:start position:0%
expenditure so i just think that the
 
01:47:31.350 --> 01:47:31.360 align:start position:0%
bill has too many flaws to allow it to
 
01:47:32.870 --> 01:47:32.880 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
01:47:35.350 --> 01:47:35.360 align:start position:0%
and i say that with total respect for
 
01:47:38.550 --> 01:47:38.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:40.950 --> 01:47:40.960 align:start position:0%
thank you representative spillsbury

thank you mr chairman and uh thank you
 
01:47:53.350 --> 01:47:53.360 align:start position:0%
representative spillsbury um
 
01:47:55.990 --> 01:47:56.000 align:start position:0%
certainly in an era of really
 
01:47:59.030 --> 01:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
partisan politics it's been a pleasure
 
01:48:00.950 --> 01:48:00.960 align:start position:0%
to pass back and forth uh some of the
 
01:48:02.470 --> 01:48:02.480 align:start position:0%
comments and the amendments that have
 
01:48:07.030 --> 01:48:07.040 align:start position:0%
been worked on um i i think as talking
 
01:48:09.350 --> 01:48:09.360 align:start position:0%
to representative wilhelm about the bill
 
01:48:11.430 --> 01:48:11.440 align:start position:0%
the intent was not to get too deeply
 
01:48:13.830 --> 01:48:13.840 align:start position:0%
into the weed so to speak as to the
 
01:48:13.840 --> 01:48:15.430 align:start position:0%
into the weed so to speak as to the
details

01:48:15.430 --> 01:48:15.440 align:start position:0%
details
 
01:48:17.910 --> 01:48:17.920 align:start position:0%
but in an effort within the amendment it
 
01:48:20.310 --> 01:48:20.320 align:start position:0%
was made to basically state that
 
01:48:22.950 --> 01:48:22.960 align:start position:0%
a term of service was a term of service
 
01:48:24.870 --> 01:48:24.880 align:start position:0%
either in the americorps peace corps not
 
01:48:26.310 --> 01:48:26.320 align:start position:0%
necessarily related to anything
 
01:48:28.950 --> 01:48:28.960 align:start position:0%
regarding a term in a college or
 
01:48:28.960 --> 01:48:31.350 align:start position:0%
regarding a term in a college or
university

01:48:31.350 --> 01:48:31.360 align:start position:0%
university
 
01:48:33.910 --> 01:48:33.920 align:start position:0%
the intent was also that the peace corps
 
01:48:35.590 --> 01:48:35.600 align:start position:0%
americorps have different lengths of
 
01:48:37.830 --> 01:48:37.840 align:start position:0%
time in service
 
01:48:39.510 --> 01:48:39.520 align:start position:0%
that length of time and service may be
 
01:48:41.830 --> 01:48:41.840 align:start position:0%
compromised by a geopolitical problem
 
01:48:43.669 --> 01:48:43.679 align:start position:0%
say if you are in the peace corps in
 
01:48:45.510 --> 01:48:45.520 align:start position:0%
ukraine right now that may you know
 
01:48:47.990 --> 01:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
interrupt your time of service and they
 
01:48:49.510 --> 01:48:49.520 align:start position:0%
shorten it substantially and therefore
 
01:48:50.950 --> 01:48:50.960 align:start position:0%
there was a certain
 
01:48:50.960 --> 01:48:51.830 align:start position:0%
there was a certain
uh

01:48:51.830 --> 01:48:51.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:48:53.669 --> 01:48:53.679 align:start position:0%
laxity in the amount of monies that
 
01:48:55.990 --> 01:48:56.000 align:start position:0%
would be matched to
 
01:48:59.270 --> 01:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
support these individuals
 
01:49:01.510 --> 01:49:01.520 align:start position:0%
but satisfactory completion of service
 
01:49:03.669 --> 01:49:03.679 align:start position:0%
is actually determined by the rules and
 
01:49:05.430 --> 01:49:05.440 align:start position:0%
certifications of both americorps and
 
01:49:06.550 --> 01:49:06.560 align:start position:0%
peace corps
 
01:49:08.390 --> 01:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
and we were trying to leave it at that
 
01:49:11.590 --> 01:49:11.600 align:start position:0%
point to have them determine who has or
 
01:49:14.070 --> 01:49:14.080 align:start position:0%
who has not completed a successful term
 
01:49:16.310 --> 01:49:16.320 align:start position:0%
of service
 
01:49:18.310 --> 01:49:18.320 align:start position:0%
it was also the intent that again
 
01:49:20.149 --> 01:49:20.159 align:start position:0%
without becoming
 
01:49:20.159 --> 01:49:21.270 align:start position:0%
without becoming
too

01:49:21.270 --> 01:49:21.280 align:start position:0%
too
 
01:49:23.350 --> 01:49:23.360 align:start position:0%
heavily detailed
 
01:49:25.430 --> 01:49:25.440 align:start position:0%
and prescriptive in its
 
01:49:25.440 --> 01:49:26.470 align:start position:0%
and prescriptive in its
rollout

01:49:26.470 --> 01:49:26.480 align:start position:0%
rollout
 
01:49:29.189 --> 01:49:29.199 align:start position:0%
that an eligible student had to have
 
01:49:31.750 --> 01:49:31.760 align:start position:0%
received a grant or a
 
01:49:33.910 --> 01:49:33.920 align:start position:0%
scholarship from a university
 
01:49:36.390 --> 01:49:36.400 align:start position:0%
or have spent at least one year of
 
01:49:38.310 --> 01:49:38.320 align:start position:0%
service in the employment of the
 
01:49:40.950 --> 01:49:40.960 align:start position:0%
employer's business
 
01:49:42.870 --> 01:49:42.880 align:start position:0%
uh those were stipulations that were
 
01:49:44.629 --> 01:49:44.639 align:start position:0%
made in whatever the college or
 
01:49:47.430 --> 01:49:47.440 align:start position:0%
university or the employer gave in debt
 
01:49:50.149 --> 01:49:50.159 align:start position:0%
relief for college and education
 
01:49:53.030 --> 01:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
that monies would be matched um out of
 
01:49:55.910 --> 01:49:55.920 align:start position:0%
opera funds without any implication or
 
01:49:57.910 --> 01:49:57.920 align:start position:0%
any impact on the general fund or the
 
01:49:59.669 --> 01:49:59.679 align:start position:0%
educational trust fund
 
01:50:01.750 --> 01:50:01.760 align:start position:0%
uh to the same dollar amount not to
 
01:50:03.189 --> 01:50:03.199 align:start position:0%
exceed in the lifetime of their
 
01:50:05.030 --> 01:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
participation any more than six thousand
 
01:50:05.040 --> 01:50:06.470 align:start position:0%
participation any more than six thousand
dollars

01:50:06.470 --> 01:50:06.480 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:50:06.480 --> 01:50:07.350 align:start position:0%
dollars
um

01:50:07.350 --> 01:50:07.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:09.510 --> 01:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
so i think the amendment again with
 
01:50:10.629 --> 01:50:10.639 align:start position:0%
representative spillsbury's
 
01:50:13.109 --> 01:50:13.119 align:start position:0%
encouragement uh we did put a finer
 
01:50:15.109 --> 01:50:15.119 align:start position:0%
point on some of the questions that were
 
01:50:15.119 --> 01:50:17.109 align:start position:0%
point on some of the questions that were
raised

01:50:17.109 --> 01:50:17.119 align:start position:0%
raised
 
01:50:20.149 --> 01:50:20.159 align:start position:0%
i i also reflect on this in a sense of
 
01:50:22.550 --> 01:50:22.560 align:start position:0%
the intent of the build you know at the
 
01:50:24.950 --> 01:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
at a 50 000 foot level is really the
 
01:50:28.149 --> 01:50:28.159 align:start position:0%
intent to recruit and retain what i
 
01:50:29.589 --> 01:50:29.599 align:start position:0%
would consider i think we would all
 
01:50:31.669 --> 01:50:31.679 align:start position:0%
agree are very qualified
 
01:50:34.390 --> 01:50:34.400 align:start position:0%
quality high valued committed
 
01:50:36.790 --> 01:50:36.800 align:start position:0%
individuals whether they are in graduate
 
01:50:38.550 --> 01:50:38.560 align:start position:0%
studies or in
 
01:50:40.390 --> 01:50:40.400 align:start position:0%
in their employment
 
01:50:41.510 --> 01:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
we know
 
01:50:44.149 --> 01:50:44.159 align:start position:0%
by a lot of the data that we see from
 
01:50:46.470 --> 01:50:46.480 align:start position:0%
various organizations in the state
 
01:50:48.390 --> 01:50:48.400 align:start position:0%
people graduating from high school tend
 
01:50:51.350 --> 01:50:51.360 align:start position:0%
to leave the state and do not return if
 
01:50:53.990 --> 01:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
they do come back into graduate studies
 
01:50:55.750 --> 01:50:55.760 align:start position:0%
college or employment bring in their
 
01:50:55.760 --> 01:50:56.709 align:start position:0%
college or employment bring in their
family

01:50:56.709 --> 01:50:56.719 align:start position:0%
family
 
01:50:58.629 --> 01:50:58.639 align:start position:0%
there's a much greater chance that these
 
01:51:01.109 --> 01:51:01.119 align:start position:0%
folks will stay in the state
 
01:51:04.470 --> 01:51:04.480 align:start position:0%
last week we heard from
 
01:51:06.470 --> 01:51:06.480 align:start position:0%
dan white from moody's and also phil
 
01:51:07.830 --> 01:51:07.840 align:start position:0%
slatten from the
 
01:51:10.629 --> 01:51:10.639 align:start position:0%
fiscal policy institute
 
01:51:12.470 --> 01:51:12.480 align:start position:0%
since we have been involved in the
 
01:51:14.950 --> 01:51:14.960 align:start position:0%
pandemic our number of the jobs have
 
01:51:17.990 --> 01:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
returned to the state but shockingly
 
01:51:20.629 --> 01:51:20.639 align:start position:0%
we have lagged way behind in job
 
01:51:23.350 --> 01:51:23.360 align:start position:0%
participation we are at 97 where the
 
01:51:25.589 --> 01:51:25.599 align:start position:0%
country is at around 99
 
01:51:27.430 --> 01:51:27.440 align:start position:0%
that's a huge problem for our state with
 
01:51:29.270 --> 01:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
an aging population
 
01:51:31.030 --> 01:51:31.040 align:start position:0%
increasing retirement
 
01:51:33.350 --> 01:51:33.360 align:start position:0%
and young individuals leaving the state
 
01:51:35.270 --> 01:51:35.280 align:start position:0%
and not returning we are setting
 
01:51:37.589 --> 01:51:37.599 align:start position:0%
ourselves up to have a very significant
 
01:51:39.669 --> 01:51:39.679 align:start position:0%
job force problem
 
01:51:42.629 --> 01:51:42.639 align:start position:0%
the intent of the bill
 
01:51:44.390 --> 01:51:44.400 align:start position:0%
is is really in somebody actually
 
01:51:45.830 --> 01:51:45.840 align:start position:0%
brought up in the committee in one of
 
01:51:47.830 --> 01:51:47.840 align:start position:0%
the work sessions why do we want to be
 
01:51:49.990 --> 01:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
the first in the country to establish
 
01:51:52.470 --> 01:51:52.480 align:start position:0%
this sort of program i would argue if
 
01:51:54.790 --> 01:51:54.800 align:start position:0%
you're number 50 in the country with
 
01:51:56.229 --> 01:51:56.239 align:start position:0%
regard to
 
01:51:58.790 --> 01:51:58.800 align:start position:0%
job participation we ought to be looking
 
01:52:00.470 --> 01:52:00.480 align:start position:0%
at those numbers and really addressing
 
01:52:02.790 --> 01:52:02.800 align:start position:0%
those with any program we can
 
01:52:05.510 --> 01:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
if in fact we are putting forward opera
 
01:52:07.669 --> 01:52:07.679 align:start position:0%
monies without any implication to the
 
01:52:09.990 --> 01:52:10.000 align:start position:0%
general trust fund the educational trust
 
01:52:12.790 --> 01:52:12.800 align:start position:0%
fund if we are bringing back mature
 
01:52:14.870 --> 01:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
qualif quality people
 
01:52:17.830 --> 01:52:17.840 align:start position:0%
to study here and or work here
 
01:52:20.229 --> 01:52:20.239 align:start position:0%
if we are doing this without any impact
 
01:52:22.709 --> 01:52:22.719 align:start position:0%
to the general fund or any other or any
 
01:52:24.629 --> 01:52:24.639 align:start position:0%
other funding here
 
01:52:26.870 --> 01:52:26.880 align:start position:0%
why would we not do that yes it is a
 
01:52:28.470 --> 01:52:28.480 align:start position:0%
three-year trial
 
01:52:31.030 --> 01:52:31.040 align:start position:0%
if it is successful then i think the
 
01:52:33.030 --> 01:52:33.040 align:start position:0%
next step logical step would be to look
 
01:52:35.189 --> 01:52:35.199 align:start position:0%
for alternative funding
 
01:52:36.709 --> 01:52:36.719 align:start position:0%
to help you know support this whether
 
01:52:38.709 --> 01:52:38.719 align:start position:0%
it's public or private that could be
 
01:52:40.470 --> 01:52:40.480 align:start position:0%
determined later but i think we will not
 
01:52:43.990 --> 01:52:44.000 align:start position:0%
know that unless we actually trial it so
 
01:52:46.390 --> 01:52:46.400 align:start position:0%
i i appreciate that i think what the
 
01:52:48.550 --> 01:52:48.560 align:start position:0%
intent was and again i i'm respectful of
 
01:52:51.030 --> 01:52:51.040 align:start position:0%
your comments we were trying not to get
 
01:52:53.430 --> 01:52:53.440 align:start position:0%
so deeply involved in the wordage but i
 
01:52:55.669 --> 01:52:55.679 align:start position:0%
think it is clear that these are arpa
 
01:52:55.679 --> 01:52:56.950 align:start position:0%
think it is clear that these are arpa
funds

01:52:56.950 --> 01:52:56.960 align:start position:0%
funds
 
01:52:58.870 --> 01:52:58.880 align:start position:0%
that if a
 
01:53:00.950 --> 01:53:00.960 align:start position:0%
school or university pro is working
 
01:53:03.589 --> 01:53:03.599 align:start position:0%
within the coverdell fellowship programs
 
01:53:05.510 --> 01:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
or the americorps schools of service
 
01:53:08.390 --> 01:53:08.400 align:start position:0%
program or if an employer is enrolled in
 
01:53:10.149 --> 01:53:10.159 align:start position:0%
the employers of national service
 
01:53:12.470 --> 01:53:12.480 align:start position:0%
program there are certain guidelines
 
01:53:14.070 --> 01:53:14.080 align:start position:0%
with which they are working within in
 
01:53:15.990 --> 01:53:16.000 align:start position:0%
order to give grants and or monies to
 
01:53:17.830 --> 01:53:17.840 align:start position:0%
these individuals
 
01:53:19.990 --> 01:53:20.000 align:start position:0%
i think in this state we are clearly at
 
01:53:21.990 --> 01:53:22.000 align:start position:0%
a point where we need to focus on our
 
01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:23.109 align:start position:0%
a point where we need to focus on our
workforce

01:53:23.109 --> 01:53:23.119 align:start position:0%
workforce
 
01:53:25.589 --> 01:53:25.599 align:start position:0%
we focus on housing but we don't have a
 
01:53:26.870 --> 01:53:26.880 align:start position:0%
housing problem if we don't have a
 
01:53:29.589 --> 01:53:29.599 align:start position:0%
workforce so unless we really start
 
01:53:31.910 --> 01:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
thinking about this in starting to
 
01:53:33.830 --> 01:53:33.840 align:start position:0%
initiate programs
 
01:53:35.430 --> 01:53:35.440 align:start position:0%
i i think we're going to find ourselves
 
01:53:36.870 --> 01:53:36.880 align:start position:0%
in a very difficult position going
 
01:53:38.310 --> 01:53:38.320 align:start position:0%
forward so i would
 
01:53:39.830 --> 01:53:39.840 align:start position:0%
i would encourage and hope that people
 
01:53:41.750 --> 01:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
would support this bill uh
 
01:53:43.270 --> 01:53:43.280 align:start position:0%
representative wilhelm has put a lot of
 
01:53:45.910 --> 01:53:45.920 align:start position:0%
effort into this and i think as will you
 
01:53:47.589 --> 01:53:47.599 align:start position:0%
as we all agree and as you mentioned
 
01:53:49.750 --> 01:53:49.760 align:start position:0%
representative bill is very the the
 
01:53:51.510 --> 01:53:51.520 align:start position:0%
motion or the motive behind this is
 
01:53:53.430 --> 01:53:53.440 align:start position:0%
laudatory and i think that we ought to
 
01:53:54.550 --> 01:53:54.560 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:53:56.629 --> 01:53:56.639 align:start position:0%
step forward to help our uh universities
 
01:53:59.189 --> 01:53:59.199 align:start position:0%
and colleges and our employers bring in
 
01:54:01.350 --> 01:54:01.360 align:start position:0%
excellent people into these systems
 
01:54:02.709 --> 01:54:02.719 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:54:04.470 --> 01:54:04.480 align:start position:0%
thank you representative murphy
 
01:54:06.550 --> 01:54:06.560 align:start position:0%
representative longman
 
01:54:09.830 --> 01:54:09.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman you know
 
01:54:11.669 --> 01:54:11.679 align:start position:0%
just within the hour we execute a bill
 
01:54:14.229 --> 01:54:14.239 align:start position:0%
that we believed in and its intent and
 
01:54:15.830 --> 01:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
it wasn't perfect but we knew we could
 
01:54:18.149 --> 01:54:18.159 align:start position:0%
fix it in the senate uh we agreed on
 
01:54:18.159 --> 01:54:19.109 align:start position:0%
fix it in the senate uh we agreed on
that

01:54:19.109 --> 01:54:19.119 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:54:21.350 --> 01:54:21.360 align:start position:0%
um and the last bill we talked about you
 
01:54:22.870 --> 01:54:22.880 align:start position:0%
know how we can help business and we
 
01:54:22.880 --> 01:54:23.910 align:start position:0%
know how we can help business and we
thought

01:54:23.910 --> 01:54:23.920 align:start position:0%
thought
 
01:54:26.229 --> 01:54:26.239 align:start position:0%
yet another shaving of a fraction off of
 
01:54:28.310 --> 01:54:28.320 align:start position:0%
a business profits tax was the best way
 
01:54:30.070 --> 01:54:30.080 align:start position:0%
to help business but
 
01:54:31.990 --> 01:54:32.000 align:start position:0%
when i talk to business
 
01:54:34.390 --> 01:54:34.400 align:start position:0%
every single time the first and foremost
 
01:54:37.189 --> 01:54:37.199 align:start position:0%
issue that comes up is workforce
 
01:54:39.189 --> 01:54:39.199 align:start position:0%
this bill actually does address that
 
01:54:40.550 --> 01:54:40.560 align:start position:0%
problem so
 
01:54:41.669 --> 01:54:41.679 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:54:44.310 --> 01:54:44.320 align:start position:0%
if we can focus and prioritize
 
01:54:44.320 --> 01:54:45.589 align:start position:0%
if we can focus and prioritize
initiatives

01:54:45.589 --> 01:54:45.599 align:start position:0%
initiatives
 
01:54:48.229 --> 01:54:48.239 align:start position:0%
efforts bills like this that help to
 
01:54:50.470 --> 01:54:50.480 align:start position:0%
attract and retain workforce in this
 
01:54:50.480 --> 01:54:51.910 align:start position:0%
attract and retain workforce in this
state

01:54:51.910 --> 01:54:51.920 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:54:53.270 --> 01:54:53.280 align:start position:0%
that's going to go
 
01:54:55.510 --> 01:54:55.520 align:start position:0%
a lot farther in my opinion and i i
 
01:54:58.550 --> 01:54:58.560 align:start position:0%
would wager many business owners opinion
 
01:55:01.430 --> 01:55:01.440 align:start position:0%
than yet another fraction of a point
 
01:55:03.910 --> 01:55:03.920 align:start position:0%
off of attacks that they didn't ask for
 
01:55:05.430 --> 01:55:05.440 align:start position:0%
now how you feel about that doesn't
 
01:55:07.350 --> 01:55:07.360 align:start position:0%
matter but i'd say
 
01:55:09.750 --> 01:55:09.760 align:start position:0%
workforce related uh initiatives like
 
01:55:12.310 --> 01:55:12.320 align:start position:0%
this is huge for business and
 
01:55:13.669 --> 01:55:13.679 align:start position:0%
and that's why i'm going to support it
 
01:55:15.189 --> 01:55:15.199 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:55:15.199 --> 01:55:17.669 align:start position:0%
thank you
representative

01:55:17.669 --> 01:55:17.679 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:55:20.149 --> 01:55:20.159 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman on what the
 
01:55:23.189 --> 01:55:23.199 align:start position:0%
employer has to do to trigger this
 
01:55:25.430 --> 01:55:25.440 align:start position:0%
is in the bill
 
01:55:29.109 --> 01:55:29.119 align:start position:0%
on they have to enroll in a national
 
01:55:29.119 --> 01:55:31.189 align:start position:0%
on they have to enroll in a national
program

01:55:31.189 --> 01:55:31.199 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:55:34.709 --> 01:55:34.719 align:start position:0%
called on several of them employers of
 
01:55:36.550 --> 01:55:36.560 align:start position:0%
national service
 
01:55:38.790 --> 01:55:38.800 align:start position:0%
and the americorps schools of service or
 
01:55:42.070 --> 01:55:42.080 align:start position:0%
the peace corps cover dell fellows
 
01:55:42.080 --> 01:55:43.189 align:start position:0%
the peace corps cover dell fellows
program

01:55:43.189 --> 01:55:43.199 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:55:46.629 --> 01:55:46.639 align:start position:0%
on i think one of the intents of what
 
01:55:49.109 --> 01:55:49.119 align:start position:0%
they want to do besides
 
01:55:51.589 --> 01:55:51.599 align:start position:0%
proving this concept
 
01:55:53.350 --> 01:55:53.360 align:start position:0%
is to get
 
01:55:55.189 --> 01:55:55.199 align:start position:0%
more businesses in new hampshire
 
01:55:56.870 --> 01:55:56.880 align:start position:0%
involved in
 
01:55:59.430 --> 01:55:59.440 align:start position:0%
the these retention and training
 
01:56:01.189 --> 01:56:01.199 align:start position:0%
programs that will give them the
 
01:56:03.189 --> 01:56:03.199 align:start position:0%
workforce they need
 
01:56:03.199 --> 01:56:03.990 align:start position:0%
workforce they need
and

01:56:03.990 --> 01:56:04.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:05.030 align:start position:0%
and
on

01:56:05.030 --> 01:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:56:08.149 --> 01:56:08.159 align:start position:0%
and in enrolling in those programs as
 
01:56:10.149 --> 01:56:10.159 align:start position:0%
business owners
 
01:56:10.159 --> 01:56:12.070 align:start position:0%
business owners
on

01:56:12.070 --> 01:56:12.080 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:56:12.080 --> 01:56:13.030 align:start position:0%
on
the

01:56:13.030 --> 01:56:13.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:56:14.629 --> 01:56:14.639 align:start position:0%
the other
 
01:56:16.149 --> 01:56:16.159 align:start position:0%
there is no
 
01:56:19.669 --> 01:56:19.679 align:start position:0%
sunset because the idea was
 
01:56:21.830 --> 01:56:21.840 align:start position:0%
that they figured that they would go
 
01:56:25.430 --> 01:56:25.440 align:start position:0%
through about 250 000 a year
 
01:56:25.440 --> 01:56:27.430 align:start position:0%
through about 250 000 a year
uh

01:56:27.430 --> 01:56:27.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:56:29.350 --> 01:56:29.360 align:start position:0%
seven hundred and fifty thousand over
 
01:56:32.310 --> 01:56:32.320 align:start position:0%
three years versus eight million that we
 
01:56:34.629 --> 01:56:34.639 align:start position:0%
just spent per year
 
01:56:37.589 --> 01:56:37.599 align:start position:0%
on this one percent point one percent
 
01:56:37.599 --> 01:56:38.790 align:start position:0%
on this one percent point one percent
concept

01:56:38.790 --> 01:56:38.800 align:start position:0%
concept
 
01:56:38.800 --> 01:56:40.229 align:start position:0%
concept
um

01:56:40.229 --> 01:56:40.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:42.390 --> 01:56:42.400 align:start position:0%
and it sets the 700
 
01:56:44.629 --> 01:56:44.639 align:start position:0%
the way we've rewritten it
 
01:56:48.470 --> 01:56:48.480 align:start position:0%
it sets the 750 000
 
01:56:52.149 --> 01:56:52.159 align:start position:0%
aside at this at one time
 
01:56:54.709 --> 01:56:54.719 align:start position:0%
and no there is no sunset the sunset
 
01:56:58.470 --> 01:56:58.480 align:start position:0%
would be if they cannot attract funding
 
01:57:01.669 --> 01:57:01.679 align:start position:0%
later probably from business groups
 
01:57:04.229 --> 01:57:04.239 align:start position:0%
to keep this going because it is a
 
01:57:07.030 --> 01:57:07.040 align:start position:0%
reliable source of new labor
 
01:57:08.470 --> 01:57:08.480 align:start position:0%
that is
 
01:57:13.589 --> 01:57:13.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:18.229 --> 01:57:18.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:21.669 --> 01:57:21.679 align:start position:0%
yes it is unbudgeted but the way this
 
01:57:24.950 --> 01:57:24.960 align:start position:0%
legislature has always worked is that it
 
01:57:27.589 --> 01:57:27.599 align:start position:0%
to put that money in
 
01:57:27.599 --> 01:57:28.870 align:start position:0%
to put that money in
and

01:57:28.870 --> 01:57:28.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:57:31.189 --> 01:57:31.199 align:start position:0%
in this particular case
 
01:57:31.199 --> 01:57:33.589 align:start position:0%
in this particular case
because

01:57:33.589 --> 01:57:33.599 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:57:34.870 --> 01:57:34.880 align:start position:0%
it would
 
01:57:38.470 --> 01:57:38.480 align:start position:0%
the idea the sponsor's idea was never to
 
01:57:41.189 --> 01:57:41.199 align:start position:0%
take it out of the general fund it was
 
01:57:44.790 --> 01:57:44.800 align:start position:0%
to go after money that is in arpa that
 
01:57:46.470 --> 01:57:46.480 align:start position:0%
covers this
 
01:57:46.480 --> 01:57:47.669 align:start position:0%
covers this
and

01:57:47.669 --> 01:57:47.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:57:49.109 --> 01:57:49.119 align:start position:0%
the governor
 
01:57:51.189 --> 01:57:51.199 align:start position:0%
has control of the arpa funds the
 
01:57:53.990 --> 01:57:54.000 align:start position:0%
governor would have to decide whether
 
01:57:56.390 --> 01:57:56.400 align:start position:0%
he's actually going to appropriate that
 
01:57:59.669 --> 01:57:59.679 align:start position:0%
money out of the arpa fund
 
01:58:02.229 --> 01:58:02.239 align:start position:0%
if this bill passes it seems likely he
 
01:58:05.030 --> 01:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
would since he has a representative on
 
01:58:07.350 --> 01:58:07.360 align:start position:0%
volunteer new hampshire
 
01:58:07.360 --> 01:58:08.870 align:start position:0%

01:58:11.109 --> 01:58:11.119 align:start position:0%
he also
 
01:58:14.310 --> 01:58:14.320 align:start position:0%
cares about the workforce
 
01:58:17.030 --> 01:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
i wanted also there there was an email
 
01:58:18.709 --> 01:58:18.719 align:start position:0%
that you got
 
01:58:22.070 --> 01:58:22.080 align:start position:0%

02:05:51.189 --> 02:05:51.199 align:start position:0%
so i'd like to introduce 1584 for the
 
02:05:53.350 --> 02:05:53.360 align:start position:0%

behavioral that's in new hampshire not
 
02:05:58.069 --> 02:05:58.079 align:start position:0%
the one in the south of us in
 
02:05:58.079 --> 02:05:59.830 align:start position:0%
the one in the south of us in
massachusetts

02:05:59.830 --> 02:05:59.840 align:start position:0%
massachusetts
 
02:06:02.550 --> 02:06:02.560 align:start position:0%
1584 was submitted to establish an
 
02:06:04.550 --> 02:06:04.560 align:start position:0%
improvement grant capital improvement
 
02:06:07.030 --> 02:06:07.040 align:start position:0%
grant program for the state fairs which
 
02:06:08.709 --> 02:06:08.719 align:start position:0%
exist in our state
 
02:06:12.069 --> 02:06:12.079 align:start position:0%
and the state fair association has
 
02:06:14.069 --> 02:06:14.079 align:start position:0%
approximately 11 state fairs now
 
02:06:15.510 --> 02:06:15.520 align:start position:0%
currently operating within that
 
02:06:18.149 --> 02:06:18.159 align:start position:0%
association and within that association
 
02:06:19.430 --> 02:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
there's definite
 
02:06:21.430 --> 02:06:21.440 align:start position:0%
rules and criteria for being member i
 
02:06:22.870 --> 02:06:22.880 align:start position:0%
won't go into that
 
02:06:24.790 --> 02:06:24.800 align:start position:0%
this bill was
 
02:06:26.550 --> 02:06:26.560 align:start position:0%
we want to continue
 
02:06:28.550 --> 02:06:28.560 align:start position:0%
supporting our fares to promote
 
02:06:30.950 --> 02:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
agriculture in our state which is a key
 
02:06:33.830 --> 02:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
industry and a key economic driver in
 
02:06:35.750 --> 02:06:35.760 align:start position:0%
many locations
 
02:06:37.910 --> 02:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
throughout north south east and west
 
02:06:41.109 --> 02:06:41.119 align:start position:0%
it's also a rural economic development
 
02:06:43.189 --> 02:06:43.199 align:start position:0%
factor that we need to look at and
 
02:06:45.510 --> 02:06:45.520 align:start position:0%
maintain and it's an education factor
 
02:06:47.350 --> 02:06:47.360 align:start position:0%
and this is why from the education side
 
02:06:49.430 --> 02:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
of things i got very involved with it
 
02:06:51.270 --> 02:06:51.280 align:start position:0%
and working with our future farmers of
 
02:06:53.990 --> 02:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
america and with the 4-h
 
02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:54.790 align:start position:0%
america and with the 4-h
so

02:06:54.790 --> 02:06:54.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:06:56.629 --> 02:06:56.639 align:start position:0%
what we're looking at is the are these
 
02:06:59.030 --> 02:06:59.040 align:start position:0%
fares and during the past several years
 
02:07:01.910 --> 02:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
i would say the next last 20 years or so
 
02:07:03.910 --> 02:07:03.920 align:start position:0%
there has been no support for these
 
02:07:06.069 --> 02:07:06.079 align:start position:0%
fares other than what you can get at the
 
02:07:07.990 --> 02:07:08.000 align:start position:0%
gate as revenue coming in
 
02:07:10.550 --> 02:07:10.560 align:start position:0%
or what they pay once they're inside
 
02:07:14.470 --> 02:07:14.480 align:start position:0%
and and to keep these fares operational
 
02:07:16.149 --> 02:07:16.159 align:start position:0%
due to the
 
02:07:18.550 --> 02:07:18.560 align:start position:0%
numerous code changes we've had in terms
 
02:07:20.950 --> 02:07:20.960 align:start position:0%
of health life and safety in terms of
 
02:07:22.950 --> 02:07:22.960 align:start position:0%
the amount of energy has to be used in
 
02:07:24.550 --> 02:07:24.560 align:start position:0%
these with three phase having to be
 
02:07:28.390 --> 02:07:28.400 align:start position:0%
brought in it's been very very difficult
 
02:07:28.400 --> 02:07:29.189 align:start position:0%
brought in it's been very very difficult
so

02:07:29.189 --> 02:07:29.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:07:31.189 --> 02:07:31.199 align:start position:0%
the overall purpose is to try to
 
02:07:33.270 --> 02:07:33.280 align:start position:0%
establish an improvement grant program
 
02:07:34.550 --> 02:07:34.560 align:start position:0%
that's under the management of the
 
02:07:36.550 --> 02:07:36.560 align:start position:0%
department of agriculture
 
02:07:39.510 --> 02:07:39.520 align:start position:0%
and and marketing uh commissioner jasper
 
02:07:43.030 --> 02:07:43.040 align:start position:0%
and to have a non-lapsing fund available
 
02:07:45.430 --> 02:07:45.440 align:start position:0%
in which folks could apply for a grant
 
02:07:46.629 --> 02:07:46.639 align:start position:0%
to help them with their capital
 
02:07:48.709 --> 02:07:48.719 align:start position:0%
improvements now there is certain psych
 
02:07:48.719 --> 02:07:49.990 align:start position:0%
improvements now there is certain psych
criteria

02:07:49.990 --> 02:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
criteria
 
02:07:52.229 --> 02:07:52.239 align:start position:0%
and conditions that must be met and i'm
 
02:07:53.189 --> 02:07:53.199 align:start position:0%
not going to go through them you can
 
02:07:55.030 --> 02:07:55.040 align:start position:0%
read the bill just as well as i can and
 
02:07:56.709 --> 02:07:56.719 align:start position:0%
i know you're busy so i won't go through
 
02:07:58.870 --> 02:07:58.880 align:start position:0%
those conditions and criteria
 
02:08:00.790 --> 02:08:00.800 align:start position:0%
five percent of the grant money
 
02:08:03.350 --> 02:08:03.360 align:start position:0%
appropriate can be left behind for
 
02:08:05.189 --> 02:08:05.199 align:start position:0%
administration of the program at
 
02:08:08.790 --> 02:08:08.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:11.189 --> 02:08:11.199 align:start position:0%
where we got the idea for putting this
 
02:08:12.550 --> 02:08:12.560 align:start position:0%
forward was from numerous states
 
02:08:14.470 --> 02:08:14.480 align:start position:0%
throughout this country from washington
 
02:08:17.430 --> 02:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
uh state vermont utah kansas so it's a
 
02:08:19.350 --> 02:08:19.360 align:start position:0%
bit of everything in it
 
02:08:23.030 --> 02:08:23.040 align:start position:0%
back in 1939 in this date through 1987
 
02:08:25.189 --> 02:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
we had rockingham
 
02:08:27.189 --> 02:08:27.199 align:start position:0%
and from that we from the para mutual
 
02:08:29.830 --> 02:08:29.840 align:start position:0%
pools distribution to the fairs from a
 
02:08:31.750 --> 02:08:31.760 align:start position:0%
portion of the tax gained from these
 
02:08:35.030 --> 02:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
pools was used in support of the affairs
 
02:08:37.270 --> 02:08:37.280 align:start position:0%
and in 1979
 
02:08:41.990 --> 02:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
that generated approximately 275 000
 
02:08:43.990 --> 02:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
and and for the agricultural affairs of
 
02:08:46.790 --> 02:08:46.800 align:start position:0%
which 50 000 dollars
 
02:08:49.669 --> 02:08:49.679 align:start position:0%
was for fair improvements
 
02:08:52.390 --> 02:08:52.400 align:start position:0%
the fair improvements are going on in
 
02:08:54.629 --> 02:08:54.639 align:start position:0%
the ferris right now it's very very
 
02:08:57.510 --> 02:08:57.520 align:start position:0%
costly to as i mentioned to upgrade
 
02:08:59.910 --> 02:08:59.920 align:start position:0%
these buildings and grounds
 
02:09:01.030 --> 02:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:09:03.030 --> 02:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
the fares are trying to deal with this
 
02:09:04.870 --> 02:09:04.880 align:start position:0%
through just they have jacked up their
 
02:09:06.390 --> 02:09:06.400 align:start position:0%
admittance rates to get into the
 
02:09:09.830 --> 02:09:09.840 align:start position:0%
fairgrounds and it's really at a very
 
02:09:12.149 --> 02:09:12.159 align:start position:0%
uh low rate in terms about 15 bucks
 
02:09:13.910 --> 02:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
ahead thereabouts give and take the
 
02:09:15.430 --> 02:09:15.440 align:start position:0%
various fair weather in rochester
 
02:09:16.550 --> 02:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
whether you're up in north haverhill
 
02:09:17.750 --> 02:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
where i hail from where we have the
 
02:09:19.830 --> 02:09:19.840 align:start position:0%
north haverford prayer
 
02:09:22.149 --> 02:09:22.159 align:start position:0%
the the affairs generate
 
02:09:24.470 --> 02:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
and from what i've gotten through the
 
02:09:26.390 --> 02:09:26.400 align:start position:0%
plymouth state university where they
 
02:09:28.310 --> 02:09:28.320 align:start position:0%
have done research on this
 
02:09:30.790 --> 02:09:30.800 align:start position:0%
is that back i'll go back the farthest i
 
02:09:33.109 --> 02:09:33.119 align:start position:0%
could get was in 2002
 
02:09:35.430 --> 02:09:35.440 align:start position:0%
visitors exhibitors and operators spent
 
02:09:39.589 --> 02:09:39.599 align:start position:0%
an estimated for 40.6 million dollars at
 
02:09:42.550 --> 02:09:42.560 align:start position:0%
or near the fairgrounds during the fairs
 
02:09:44.390 --> 02:09:44.400 align:start position:0%
including four hundred thousand dollars
 
02:09:46.950 --> 02:09:46.960 align:start position:0%
in direct purchases from those on the
 
02:09:46.960 --> 02:09:48.550 align:start position:0%
in direct purchases from those on the
grounds

02:09:48.550 --> 02:09:48.560 align:start position:0%
grounds
 
02:09:51.430 --> 02:09:51.440 align:start position:0%
so it is as it is a revenue generator it
 
02:09:56.149 --> 02:09:56.159 align:start position:0%
slipped in 2011 to 37.1 million dollars
 
02:09:58.470 --> 02:09:58.480 align:start position:0%
of which
 
02:10:01.030 --> 02:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
those fares back then had an
 
02:10:04.550 --> 02:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
approximately 907 jobs that they were
 
02:10:04.560 --> 02:10:05.350 align:start position:0%
approximately 907 jobs that they were
there

02:10:05.350 --> 02:10:05.360 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:10:07.669 --> 02:10:07.679 align:start position:0%
needed to make their fares operate since
 
02:10:09.270 --> 02:10:09.280 align:start position:0%
then the number of people that are paid
 
02:10:11.669 --> 02:10:11.679 align:start position:0%
to do these fares has shrunk
 
02:10:11.679 --> 02:10:13.189 align:start position:0%
to do these fares has shrunk
significantly

02:10:13.189 --> 02:10:13.199 align:start position:0%
significantly
 
02:10:15.669 --> 02:10:15.679 align:start position:0%
and in haverhill for example 300
 
02:10:17.990 --> 02:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
volunteers are used each year to make
 
02:10:20.310 --> 02:10:20.320 align:start position:0%
that fair grounds work
 
02:10:22.310 --> 02:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
they're also using the buildings and
 
02:10:24.950 --> 02:10:24.960 align:start position:0%
their folks here for storage during the
 
02:10:26.709 --> 02:10:26.719 align:start position:0%
winter months so that there is revenue
 
02:10:28.629 --> 02:10:28.639 align:start position:0%
coming year round in order to be
 
02:10:30.310 --> 02:10:30.320 align:start position:0%
qualifying for these grants should be
 
02:10:31.910 --> 02:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
had to be operational at least three
 
02:10:33.910 --> 02:10:33.920 align:start position:0%
days in which there is a fair offer of
 
02:10:35.990 --> 02:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
which there's eight hours per day
 
02:10:37.910 --> 02:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
and that's that's generally speaking
 
02:10:39.510 --> 02:10:39.520 align:start position:0%
what you will see not generally that is
 
02:10:40.950 --> 02:10:40.960 align:start position:0%
what you're seeing for anybody that
 
02:10:43.350 --> 02:10:43.360 align:start position:0%
would be applying for a grant
 
02:10:46.390 --> 02:10:46.400 align:start position:0%
from you they're all non-profits
 
02:10:49.030 --> 02:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
some of the fairgrounds are currently
 
02:10:52.390 --> 02:10:52.400 align:start position:0%
paying their property tax others are
 
02:10:54.470 --> 02:10:54.480 align:start position:0%
in their paying that property tax not
 
02:10:56.709 --> 02:10:56.719 align:start position:0%
looking for an exclusion or an exception
 
02:10:58.790 --> 02:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
from the town simply because they do not
 
02:11:00.790 --> 02:11:00.800 align:start position:0%
want to pass that burden on
 
02:11:03.270 --> 02:11:03.280 align:start position:0%
to the taxpayer
 
02:11:05.910 --> 02:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
that's that's a mixed bag on amongst our
 
02:11:07.910 --> 02:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
fares right now they are trying
 
02:11:10.149 --> 02:11:10.159 align:start position:0%
everything they can however the capital
 
02:11:12.950 --> 02:11:12.960 align:start position:0%
improvements uh the the budgets which
 
02:11:15.270 --> 02:11:15.280 align:start position:0%
they have have that built in
 
02:11:17.109 --> 02:11:17.119 align:start position:0%
however it can't keep up with some of
 
02:11:19.669 --> 02:11:19.679 align:start position:0%
the code restrictions that we must have
 
02:11:21.910 --> 02:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
in affairs and i hate to see new
 
02:11:24.470 --> 02:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire's fares which are a draw when
 
02:11:26.790 --> 02:11:26.800 align:start position:0%
i was coming to the north available fair
 
02:11:29.109 --> 02:11:29.119 align:start position:0%

02:11:31.109 --> 02:11:31.119 align:start position:0%
new york state out in niagara falls and
 
02:11:33.830 --> 02:11:33.840 align:start position:0%

represent i believe it was
 
02:13:07.830 --> 02:13:07.840 align:start position:0%
representative dutsy who
 
02:13:10.310 --> 02:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
was was asking the question of why
 
02:13:11.910 --> 02:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
wouldn't we have
 
02:13:13.990 --> 02:13:14.000 align:start position:0%
local businesses
 
02:13:15.430 --> 02:13:15.440 align:start position:0%
be paying
 
02:13:15.440 --> 02:13:16.550 align:start position:0%
be paying
towards

02:13:16.550 --> 02:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
towards
 
02:13:19.189 --> 02:13:19.199 align:start position:0%
uh the upkeep or capital improvements of
 
02:13:21.910 --> 02:13:21.920 align:start position:0%
these properties if they are
 
02:13:25.990 --> 02:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
receiving such a benefit of uh increase
 
02:13:27.910 --> 02:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
of their business because of all the
 
02:13:29.350 --> 02:13:29.360 align:start position:0%
visitors that come
 
02:13:31.030 --> 02:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
i hate looking around this doing here
 
02:13:32.629 --> 02:13:32.639 align:start position:0%
but um
 
02:13:34.870 --> 02:13:34.880 align:start position:0%
we have the local businesses in the area
 
02:13:36.790 --> 02:13:36.800 align:start position:0%
that i live in right now that are paying
 
02:13:38.709 --> 02:13:38.719 align:start position:0%
to be exhibitors there within the
 
02:13:40.149 --> 02:13:40.159 align:start position:0%
fairgrounds so that's a revenue that
 
02:13:41.109 --> 02:13:41.119 align:start position:0%
comes in
 
02:13:42.629 --> 02:13:42.639 align:start position:0%
they're also providing support
 
02:13:44.229 --> 02:13:44.239 align:start position:0%
throughout the school year not school
 
02:13:47.350 --> 02:13:47.360 align:start position:0%
yet the annual year to uh support our
 
02:13:49.589 --> 02:13:49.599 align:start position:0%
fairs through their volunteer services
 
02:13:51.589 --> 02:13:51.599 align:start position:0%
and providing supplemental uh
 
02:13:54.550 --> 02:13:54.560 align:start position:0%
uh equipment etc to help do some of
 
02:13:56.470 --> 02:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
these jobs that's how we put a parking
 
02:13:57.830 --> 02:13:57.840 align:start position:0%
up there in the haverhill area we did
 
02:13:59.510 --> 02:13:59.520 align:start position:0%
that in conjunction with our business
 
02:14:02.149 --> 02:14:02.159 align:start position:0%
community and that was a free service
 
02:14:03.430 --> 02:14:03.440 align:start position:0%
that they were providing that we're
 
02:14:05.350 --> 02:14:05.360 align:start position:0%
getting that out of folks like the agway
 
02:14:07.750 --> 02:14:07.760 align:start position:0%
uh folks right there in haverhill so yes
 
02:14:10.069 --> 02:14:10.079 align:start position:0%
we're going down that road but the

expenses the costs are are exceeding
 
02:14:14.790 --> 02:14:14.800 align:start position:0%
what our revenue is thank you i'm glad
 
02:14:16.629 --> 02:14:16.639 align:start position:0%
you clarified that thank you

02:14:23.830 --> 02:14:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:25.430 --> 02:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
next is
 
02:14:28.229 --> 02:14:28.239 align:start position:0%
commissioner of agriculture
 
02:14:30.310 --> 02:14:30.320 align:start position:0%
sean jasper
 
02:14:35.589 --> 02:14:35.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:37.109 --> 02:14:37.119 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman members of the
 
02:14:39.109 --> 02:14:39.119 align:start position:0%
committee i am sean jasper commissioner
 
02:14:41.109 --> 02:14:41.119 align:start position:0%
of department of agriculture markets and
 
02:14:42.790 --> 02:14:42.800 align:start position:0%
food and i
 
02:14:45.510 --> 02:14:45.520 align:start position:0%
am here in support of of the bill
 
02:14:46.950 --> 02:14:46.960 align:start position:0%
now i'm
 
02:14:48.629 --> 02:14:48.639 align:start position:0%
the chairman has reminded me that i
 
02:14:50.709 --> 02:14:50.719 align:start position:0%
should stick with the issue of
 
02:14:54.390 --> 02:14:54.400 align:start position:0%
of the uh of the fund because the policy
 
02:14:56.709 --> 02:14:56.719 align:start position:0%
uh has been adopted by the house on a
 
02:14:59.830 --> 02:14:59.840 align:start position:0%
vote of 236 to 105. so
 
02:15:02.310 --> 02:15:02.320 align:start position:0%
the house has has spoken very strongly
 
02:15:04.390 --> 02:15:04.400 align:start position:0%
that they are in support of this
 
02:15:06.709 --> 02:15:06.719 align:start position:0%
this concept um
 
02:15:08.950 --> 02:15:08.960 align:start position:0%
i do want to just deviate from that a
 
02:15:09.910 --> 02:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
02:15:11.910 --> 02:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
so the history of
 
02:15:14.629 --> 02:15:14.639 align:start position:0%
state support for our fairs actually
 
02:15:15.830 --> 02:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
goes back
 
02:15:18.229 --> 02:15:18.239 align:start position:0%
uh well before the civil war
 
02:15:20.470 --> 02:15:20.480 align:start position:0%
there have been starts and stops but the
 
02:15:23.830 --> 02:15:23.840 align:start position:0%
state has had a general policy
 
02:15:25.669 --> 02:15:25.679 align:start position:0%
over the years of supporting our fairs
 
02:15:28.550 --> 02:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
recognizing the importance to
 
02:15:30.069 --> 02:15:30.079 align:start position:0%
to new hampshire and to promoting
 
02:15:34.149 --> 02:15:34.159 align:start position:0%
agriculture and actually through 4-h and
 
02:15:36.310 --> 02:15:36.320 align:start position:0%
many of the other youth organizations
 
02:15:38.470 --> 02:15:38.480 align:start position:0%
getting the youth involved and this is
 
02:15:40.390 --> 02:15:40.400 align:start position:0%
an opportunity for them to show and to
 
02:15:43.430 --> 02:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
learn and for obviously kids who do not
 
02:15:44.629 --> 02:15:44.639 align:start position:0%
come from
 
02:15:44.639 --> 02:15:45.510 align:start position:0%
come from
um

02:15:45.510 --> 02:15:45.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:47.750 --> 02:15:47.760 align:start position:0%
rural areas to to learn about
 
02:15:47.760 --> 02:15:49.589 align:start position:0%
rural areas to to learn about
agriculture

02:15:49.589 --> 02:15:49.599 align:start position:0%
agriculture
 
02:15:51.270 --> 02:15:51.280 align:start position:0%
so i'll i'll stop there of course i'll
 
02:15:52.950 --> 02:15:52.960 align:start position:0%
be glad to answer questions moving
 
02:15:55.430 --> 02:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
forward but why a
 
02:15:57.830 --> 02:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
a non-lapsing fund well these expenses
 
02:15:59.910 --> 02:15:59.920 align:start position:0%
are not lineal you're not going to have
 
02:16:02.310 --> 02:16:02.320 align:start position:0%
the same needs every year
 
02:16:05.430 --> 02:16:05.440 align:start position:0%
as many of you may know tragically
 
02:16:07.510 --> 02:16:07.520 align:start position:0%
rochester fair which has been struggling
 
02:16:08.950 --> 02:16:08.960 align:start position:0%
and actually was closed for a year
 
02:16:10.790 --> 02:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
before reorganization
 
02:16:14.470 --> 02:16:14.480 align:start position:0%
lost a horse barn just last week to fire
 
02:16:14.480 --> 02:16:15.270 align:start position:0%
lost a horse barn just last week to fire
um

02:16:15.270 --> 02:16:15.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:17.589 --> 02:16:17.599 align:start position:0%
so there's a real need there and that is
 
02:16:19.270 --> 02:16:19.280 align:start position:0%
not going to be something that hopefully
 
02:16:21.270 --> 02:16:21.280 align:start position:0%
we see every year
 
02:16:23.830 --> 02:16:23.840 align:start position:0%
we do have the component of matching
 
02:16:25.589 --> 02:16:25.599 align:start position:0%
we do want to see in
 
02:16:27.189 --> 02:16:27.199 align:start position:0%
community involvement there there are
 
02:16:29.510 --> 02:16:29.520 align:start position:0%
going to be times when the needs are
 
02:16:32.389 --> 02:16:32.399 align:start position:0%
going to far exceed a 250
 
02:16:34.870 --> 02:16:34.880 align:start position:0%
000 a year appropriation these these
 
02:16:37.349 --> 02:16:37.359 align:start position:0%
improvements are getting very expensive
 
02:16:39.349 --> 02:16:39.359 align:start position:0%
uh many of the life safety codes some of
 
02:16:41.509 --> 02:16:41.519 align:start position:0%
which i find to be ridiculous given the
 
02:16:43.669 --> 02:16:43.679 align:start position:0%
nature of the structures are still
 
02:16:46.469 --> 02:16:46.479 align:start position:0%
putting a tremendous burden on the fares
 
02:16:47.990 --> 02:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
that's something that we as government
 
02:16:49.990 --> 02:16:50.000 align:start position:0%
are doing to the fairs
 
02:16:52.549 --> 02:16:52.559 align:start position:0%
um and so i think this is important it
 
02:16:52.559 --> 02:16:53.509 align:start position:0%
um and so i think this is important it
does

02:16:53.509 --> 02:16:53.519 align:start position:0%
does
 
02:16:56.389 --> 02:16:56.399 align:start position:0%
continue a a tradition that has existed
 
02:16:59.270 --> 02:16:59.280 align:start position:0%
albeit has been a lapse now of
 
02:17:01.790 --> 02:17:01.800 align:start position:0%
of over 40 years but if you look at that
 
02:17:05.110 --> 02:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
275 000 roughly that that went to the
 
02:17:07.990 --> 02:17:08.000 align:start position:0%
fairs 43 years ago
 
02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:09.110 align:start position:0%
fairs 43 years ago
um

02:17:09.110 --> 02:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:17:11.349 --> 02:17:11.359 align:start position:0%
that that number would be what well over
 
02:17:13.110 --> 02:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
half a million at this point we're
 
02:17:14.549 --> 02:17:14.559 align:start position:0%
asking for
 
02:17:17.110 --> 02:17:17.120 align:start position:0%
a quarter million so i'll i'll end my
 
02:17:18.629 --> 02:17:18.639 align:start position:0%
testimony there but be glad to answer
 
02:17:20.070 --> 02:17:20.080 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
02:17:23.190 --> 02:17:23.200 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner jasper
 
02:17:23.200 --> 02:17:25.990 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner jasper

02:17:25.990 --> 02:17:26.000 align:start position:0%

remember my name here thank you mr
chairman

02:17:34.070 --> 02:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
02:17:36.389 --> 02:17:36.399 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my questions i do
 
02:17:38.150 --> 02:17:38.160 align:start position:0%
have some follow-ups on this
 
02:17:40.830 --> 02:17:40.840 align:start position:0%
coming from the state of ohio
 
02:17:43.270 --> 02:17:43.280 align:start position:0%
originally every county has a fair how
 
02:17:43.280 --> 02:17:44.230 align:start position:0%
originally every county has a fair how
many

02:17:44.230 --> 02:17:44.240 align:start position:0%
many
 
02:17:46.870 --> 02:17:46.880 align:start position:0%
fairs are there presently being run in
 
02:17:49.429 --> 02:17:49.439 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire i believe the
 
02:17:50.870 --> 02:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
number is
 
02:17:53.910 --> 02:17:53.920 align:start position:0%
11. we have lost
 
02:17:56.469 --> 02:17:56.479 align:start position:0%
a couple of fares since the state has
 
02:17:56.479 --> 02:17:57.830 align:start position:0%
a couple of fares since the state has
stopped

02:17:57.830 --> 02:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
stopped
 
02:18:00.070 --> 02:18:00.080 align:start position:0%
most recently stratum
 
02:18:01.750 --> 02:18:01.760 align:start position:0%
has stopped they may try to do something
 
02:18:04.309 --> 02:18:04.319 align:start position:0%
but it's not going to be a full-blown
 
02:18:04.319 --> 02:18:05.270 align:start position:0%
but it's not going to be a full-blown
fare

02:18:05.270 --> 02:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
fare
 
02:18:07.509 --> 02:18:07.519 align:start position:0%
plymouth actually did not survive the
 
02:18:09.669 --> 02:18:09.679 align:start position:0%
transition and i think very quickly
 
02:18:11.830 --> 02:18:11.840 align:start position:0%
after the state stopped supporting
 
02:18:14.549 --> 02:18:14.559 align:start position:0%
plymouth went away and other as i said
 
02:18:16.950 --> 02:18:16.960 align:start position:0%
rochester has struggled others have and
 
02:18:19.509 --> 02:18:19.519 align:start position:0%
unfortunately with affairs much like
 
02:18:21.750 --> 02:18:21.760 align:start position:0%
agriculture in general very dependent on
 
02:18:23.270 --> 02:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
the weather
 
02:18:25.110 --> 02:18:25.120 align:start position:0%
if we could guarantee that every fair
 
02:18:27.509 --> 02:18:27.519 align:start position:0%
had sunny weather for their their runs i
 
02:18:28.790 --> 02:18:28.800 align:start position:0%
don't think we'd be
 
02:18:30.709 --> 02:18:30.719 align:start position:0%
asking for this but um
 
02:18:32.870 --> 02:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
that's a problem and i do do think that
 
02:18:35.030 --> 02:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
most every state does
 
02:18:36.830 --> 02:18:36.840 align:start position:0%
support their fares
 
02:18:39.750 --> 02:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
recognizing uh the value to the state
 
02:18:41.830 --> 02:18:41.840 align:start position:0%

02:18:41.840 --> 02:18:42.549 align:start position:0%

02:18:54.629 --> 02:18:54.639 align:start position:0%
uh number
 
02:18:56.469 --> 02:18:56.479 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry it's

seven and eight under that
 
02:19:01.190 --> 02:19:01.200 align:start position:0%
however the commissioner may make

exceptions to the above conditions and

02:19:08.389 --> 02:19:08.399 align:start position:0%
uh is there a report that you would or
 
02:19:10.230 --> 02:19:10.240 align:start position:0%
the agricultural commissioner would send
 
02:19:10.240 --> 02:19:11.750 align:start position:0%
the agricultural commissioner would send
out

02:19:11.750 --> 02:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
out
 
02:19:11.760 --> 02:19:12.039 align:start position:0%

the state legislature
 
02:19:20.549 --> 02:19:20.559 align:start position:0%
page page two i'm sorry commissioner no
 
02:19:22.950 --> 02:19:22.960 align:start position:0%
line five and then it goes
 
02:19:24.709 --> 02:19:24.719 align:start position:0%

02:19:24.719 --> 02:19:26.870 align:start position:0%

02:19:26.870 --> 02:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:19:29.750 --> 02:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
the commissioner may make exceptions
 
02:19:32.389 --> 02:19:32.399 align:start position:0%
all right um
 
02:19:33.910 --> 02:19:33.920 align:start position:0%
i just like know who does the
 
02:19:35.509 --> 02:19:35.519 align:start position:0%
commissioner report to when they make
 
02:19:38.070 --> 02:19:38.080 align:start position:0%
exceptions well i don't think that's in
 
02:19:40.070 --> 02:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
in the bill and certainly that would be
 
02:19:41.509 --> 02:19:41.519 align:start position:0%
a reasonable
 
02:19:43.509 --> 02:19:43.519 align:start position:0%
amendment in my opinion to the bill to
 
02:19:43.519 --> 02:19:44.469 align:start position:0%
amendment in my opinion to the bill to
have

02:19:44.469 --> 02:19:44.479 align:start position:0%

02:19:45.910 --> 02:19:45.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:19:48.389 --> 02:19:48.399 align:start position:0%
the commissioner give a give a report of
 
02:19:50.150 --> 02:19:50.160 align:start position:0%
the expenditures to someone obviously
 
02:19:52.309 --> 02:19:52.319 align:start position:0%
those expenditures will be out there in
 
02:19:54.469 --> 02:19:54.479 align:start position:0%
general as part of
 
02:19:56.870 --> 02:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
the process but i think to have a
 
02:19:56.880 --> 02:19:57.990 align:start position:0%
the process but i think to have a
specific

02:19:57.990 --> 02:19:58.000 align:start position:0%
specific
 
02:19:59.670 --> 02:19:59.680 align:start position:0%
report go to a
 
02:20:01.190 --> 02:20:01.200 align:start position:0%
committee of the legislature would not
 
02:20:03.510 --> 02:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
be unreasonable in the least bit
 
02:20:05.429 --> 02:20:05.439 align:start position:0%
and my final question follow-up mr
 
02:20:10.389 --> 02:20:10.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:12.389 --> 02:20:12.399 align:start position:0%
do you feel that these organizations
 
02:20:14.389 --> 02:20:14.399 align:start position:0%
maybe should create
 
02:20:17.750 --> 02:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
a foundation and raise money through
 
02:20:20.230 --> 02:20:20.240 align:start position:0%
the vehicle the foundation
 
02:20:21.750 --> 02:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
i don't think they need to have a
 
02:20:24.309 --> 02:20:24.319 align:start position:0%
foundation they're already able to to
 
02:20:25.590 --> 02:20:25.600 align:start position:0%
raise money
 
02:20:28.230 --> 02:20:28.240 align:start position:0%
um but it is very difficult i will say
 
02:20:30.550 --> 02:20:30.560 align:start position:0%
that the um
 
02:20:30.560 --> 02:20:31.510 align:start position:0%
that the um
cornish

02:20:31.510 --> 02:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
cornish
 
02:20:33.429 --> 02:20:33.439 align:start position:0%
yes the cornish fair
 
02:20:36.150 --> 02:20:36.160 align:start position:0%
had a very successful
 
02:20:38.150 --> 02:20:38.160 align:start position:0%
fundraising for a uh
 
02:20:40.309 --> 02:20:40.319 align:start position:0%
for a livestock pavilion i was at the
 
02:20:40.319 --> 02:20:41.590 align:start position:0%
for a livestock pavilion i was at the
dedication

02:20:41.590 --> 02:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
dedication
 
02:20:44.150 --> 02:20:44.160 align:start position:0%
this past summer but they had some very
 
02:20:46.630 --> 02:20:46.640 align:start position:0%
very generous local tradesmen who
 
02:20:49.030 --> 02:20:49.040 align:start position:0%
participated in that and it did take a
 
02:20:50.870 --> 02:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
long time to do that but cornish is one
 
02:20:53.110 --> 02:20:53.120 align:start position:0%
of the the smaller fares and you look at
 
02:20:55.349 --> 02:20:55.359 align:start position:0%
some of the the needs and some of the
 
02:20:55.359 --> 02:20:56.950 align:start position:0%
some of the the needs and some of the
neglect

02:20:56.950 --> 02:20:56.960 align:start position:0%
neglect
 
02:20:59.190 --> 02:20:59.200 align:start position:0%
that has has gone on
 
02:21:02.309 --> 02:21:02.319 align:start position:0%
just for for lack of resources
 
02:21:04.550 --> 02:21:04.560 align:start position:0%
that i think this small amount
 
02:21:07.190 --> 02:21:07.200 align:start position:0%
uh is something that that the state
 
02:21:09.510 --> 02:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
hopefully and certainly
 
02:21:11.270 --> 02:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
indicated by the vote of the legislature
 
02:21:12.550 --> 02:21:12.560 align:start position:0%
is willing to
 
02:21:14.469 --> 02:21:14.479 align:start position:0%
to assist because if we lose our fares
 
02:21:17.110 --> 02:21:17.120 align:start position:0%
we do lose a very important part of
 
02:21:19.190 --> 02:21:19.200 align:start position:0%
who we are
 
02:21:21.270 --> 02:21:21.280 align:start position:0%
representative romney
 
02:21:22.870 --> 02:21:22.880 align:start position:0%
thanks chair
 
02:21:25.190 --> 02:21:25.200 align:start position:0%
thank you uh commissioner jasper
 
02:21:25.200 --> 02:21:26.870 align:start position:0%
thank you uh commissioner jasper
so

02:21:26.870 --> 02:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:21:29.349 --> 02:21:29.359 align:start position:0%
ways and means no problem us looking at
 
02:21:31.590 --> 02:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
capital improvement grant program fund
 
02:21:33.429 --> 02:21:33.439 align:start position:0%
establishing that fund that's our and
 
02:21:34.870 --> 02:21:34.880 align:start position:0%
our belly wick
 
02:21:36.389 --> 02:21:36.399 align:start position:0%
what's not on our bailiwick is the
 
02:21:38.870 --> 02:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
appropriation of the 250 000
 
02:21:40.710 --> 02:21:40.720 align:start position:0%
a year so
 
02:21:43.429 --> 02:21:43.439 align:start position:0%
now this bill is effective
 
02:21:46.150 --> 02:21:46.160 align:start position:0%
july 1st so beginning of the second year
 
02:21:50.550 --> 02:21:50.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:51.990 --> 02:21:52.000 align:start position:0%
my understanding from
 
02:21:55.030 --> 02:21:55.040 align:start position:0%
speaking to the chair of finance
 
02:21:57.270 --> 02:21:57.280 align:start position:0%
that she's already has a list of 300
 
02:21:58.710 --> 02:21:58.720 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
02:21:58.720 --> 02:21:59.510 align:start position:0%
million dollars
of

02:21:59.510 --> 02:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:22:02.070 --> 02:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
ass in first committee bills
 
02:22:04.790 --> 02:22:04.800 align:start position:0%
about 200 plus another 100 million that
 
02:22:06.710 --> 02:22:06.720 align:start position:0%
they want to set aside for the sununu
 
02:22:08.870 --> 02:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
center or lawsuits
 
02:22:11.030 --> 02:22:11.040 align:start position:0%
so i don't know procedurally how we're
 
02:22:13.110 --> 02:22:13.120 align:start position:0%
going to do this but we passed a bill
 
02:22:15.750 --> 02:22:15.760 align:start position:0%
with the 250 in it
 
02:22:16.950 --> 02:22:16.960 align:start position:0%
i don't know if it goes to fiscal
 
02:22:18.389 --> 02:22:18.399 align:start position:0%
committee to try to get that
 
02:22:21.190 --> 02:22:21.200 align:start position:0%
appropriated down the road
 
02:22:23.030 --> 02:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
yeah i think you're well versed in this
 
02:22:24.870 --> 02:22:24.880 align:start position:0%
uh what's your take on how this will
 
02:22:27.750 --> 02:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
work to get the actual money in it
 
02:22:30.389 --> 02:22:30.399 align:start position:0%
well i i think generally
 
02:22:32.630 --> 02:22:32.640 align:start position:0%
um speaking the money has to be there
 
02:22:34.630 --> 02:22:34.640 align:start position:0%
for something like this to be
 
02:22:36.790 --> 02:22:36.800 align:start position:0%
to be funded now
 
02:22:38.790 --> 02:22:38.800 align:start position:0%
i i was somewhat surprised that it came
 
02:22:40.070 --> 02:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
here and not
 
02:22:42.550 --> 02:22:42.560 align:start position:0%
to finance that's my point that's my
 
02:22:42.560 --> 02:22:43.349 align:start position:0%
to finance that's my point that's my
point

02:22:43.349 --> 02:22:43.359 align:start position:0%
point
 
02:22:46.070 --> 02:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
however this is the beginning of the the
 
02:22:49.510 --> 02:22:49.520 align:start position:0%
process it's certainly going to go to
 
02:22:51.190 --> 02:22:51.200 align:start position:0%
the senate
 
02:22:52.710 --> 02:22:52.720 align:start position:0%
and no doubt
 
02:22:54.710 --> 02:22:54.720 align:start position:0%
after the policy committee
 
02:22:54.720 --> 02:22:55.670 align:start position:0%
after the policy committee
to

02:22:55.670 --> 02:22:55.680 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:22:57.429 --> 02:22:57.439 align:start position:0%
senate finance
 
02:23:00.150 --> 02:23:00.160 align:start position:0%
where that would probably be more
 
02:23:00.160 --> 02:23:02.309 align:start position:0%
where that would probably be more
appropriately

02:23:02.309 --> 02:23:02.319 align:start position:0%
appropriately
 
02:23:02.319 --> 02:23:03.750 align:start position:0%
appropriately
discussed

02:23:03.750 --> 02:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
discussed
 
02:23:06.309 --> 02:23:06.319 align:start position:0%
but um
 
02:23:08.630 --> 02:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
you know we are we are where we are and
 
02:23:11.590 --> 02:23:11.600 align:start position:0%
have have the the timing i mean i
 
02:23:14.710 --> 02:23:14.720 align:start position:0%
certainly you know if it were to go to
 
02:23:16.389 --> 02:23:16.399 align:start position:0%
um house
 
02:23:18.309 --> 02:23:18.319 align:start position:0%
finance i i don't know what the the
 
02:23:20.710 --> 02:23:20.720 align:start position:0%
timing of that is but it would be
 
02:23:22.950 --> 02:23:22.960 align:start position:0%
somewhat unusual to have they'll go
 
02:23:27.670 --> 02:23:27.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:29.590 --> 02:23:29.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman good to see you mr
 
02:23:29.600 --> 02:23:32.070 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman good to see you mr
commissioner

02:23:32.070 --> 02:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
02:23:33.750 --> 02:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
i have a question for you going back to
 
02:23:35.190 --> 02:23:35.200 align:start position:0%
the funding the sort of leans off of
 
02:23:36.790 --> 02:23:36.800 align:start position:0%
what representative schomburg said just
 
02:23:38.870 --> 02:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
a few minutes ago uh in in other
 
02:23:41.510 --> 02:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
verticals or industries we've seen uh
 
02:23:43.910 --> 02:23:43.920 align:start position:0%
public and private partnerships uh
 
02:23:46.710 --> 02:23:46.720 align:start position:0%
happen where endowments were made
 
02:23:46.720 --> 02:23:47.429 align:start position:0%
happen where endowments were made
in

02:23:47.429 --> 02:23:47.439 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:23:49.590 --> 02:23:49.600 align:start position:0%
healthcare in the arts
 
02:23:51.990 --> 02:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
where larger corporations came in to
 
02:23:55.590 --> 02:23:55.600 align:start position:0%
help support and fund in a handshake and
 
02:23:57.750 --> 02:23:57.760 align:start position:0%
a contractual agreement with
 
02:24:00.469 --> 02:24:00.479 align:start position:0%
with the state or other areas do were
 
02:24:02.630 --> 02:24:02.640 align:start position:0%
there any conversations uh in the past
 
02:24:04.469 --> 02:24:04.479 align:start position:0%
with any of our
 
02:24:06.389 --> 02:24:06.399 align:start position:0%
new hampshire larger businesses to see
 
02:24:08.389 --> 02:24:08.399 align:start position:0%
if they would help create endowments to
 
02:24:10.230 --> 02:24:10.240 align:start position:0%
help out with this i i think the
 
02:24:12.070 --> 02:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
unfortunate part i guess the simple
 
02:24:13.429 --> 02:24:13.439 align:start position:0%
question is
 
02:24:13.439 --> 02:24:14.389 align:start position:0%
question is
no

02:24:14.389 --> 02:24:14.399 align:start position:0%
no
 
02:24:16.550 --> 02:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
or probably not
 
02:24:18.710 --> 02:24:18.720 align:start position:0%
but i think the reality is that most of
 
02:24:20.630 --> 02:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
the larger corporations don't have any
 
02:24:23.510 --> 02:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
interest in in agriculture agriculture
 
02:24:25.950 --> 02:24:25.960 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire is a
 
02:24:28.469 --> 02:24:28.479 align:start position:0%
unfortunately for the most part a a
 
02:24:30.309 --> 02:24:30.319 align:start position:0%
contracting industry
 
02:24:33.510 --> 02:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
um we're losing uh equipment dealers
 
02:24:35.349 --> 02:24:35.359 align:start position:0%
they already are as supportive as they
 
02:24:36.309 --> 02:24:36.319 align:start position:0%
can be
 
02:24:37.910 --> 02:24:37.920 align:start position:0%
uh and they're stretched then you know
 
02:24:41.110 --> 02:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
we have 4h we have ffa we
 
02:24:43.110 --> 02:24:43.120 align:start position:0%
the few that we have who really care
 
02:24:45.270 --> 02:24:45.280 align:start position:0%
about agriculture
 
02:24:47.990 --> 02:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
are constantly being asked for money and
 
02:24:50.469 --> 02:24:50.479 align:start position:0%
and generally speaking they are very
 
02:24:52.309 --> 02:24:52.319 align:start position:0%
supportive but when you get into these
 
02:24:55.670 --> 02:24:55.680 align:start position:0%
big asks there are fewer and fewer
 
02:24:55.680 --> 02:24:56.790 align:start position:0%
big asks there are fewer and fewer
businesses

02:24:56.790 --> 02:24:56.800 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
02:24:58.309 --> 02:24:58.319 align:start position:0%
who we can ask
 
02:25:00.950 --> 02:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
and that's that's the problem because i
 
02:25:02.710 --> 02:25:02.720 align:start position:0%
know that all the fair associations are
 
02:25:04.870 --> 02:25:04.880 align:start position:0%
constantly struggling with this very
 
02:25:06.790 --> 02:25:06.800 align:start position:0%
question how do we get the funding and
 
02:25:08.389 --> 02:25:08.399 align:start position:0%
and this is why we're here because it's
 
02:25:08.399 --> 02:25:09.670 align:start position:0%
and this is why we're here because it's
simply

02:25:09.670 --> 02:25:09.680 align:start position:0%
simply
 
02:25:11.110 --> 02:25:11.120 align:start position:0%
not there
 
02:25:12.870 --> 02:25:12.880 align:start position:0%
thanks sir welcome
 
02:25:15.270 --> 02:25:15.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:25:17.349 --> 02:25:17.359 align:start position:0%
any further questions representing elmi
 
02:25:21.270 --> 02:25:21.280 align:start position:0%
and we have five more pink cards oh my
 
02:25:26.230 --> 02:25:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:29.910 --> 02:25:29.920 align:start position:0%
we there are two places in
 
02:25:33.270 --> 02:25:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:36.870 --> 02:25:36.880 align:start position:0%
from which on the governor could take
 
02:25:40.950 --> 02:25:40.960 align:start position:0%
money for a one-time
 
02:25:40.960 --> 02:25:42.070 align:start position:0%
money for a one-time

just voted against doing that for
 
02:25:53.910 --> 02:25:53.920 align:start position:0%
another thing that
 
02:25:55.750 --> 02:25:55.760 align:start position:0%
is probably higher on the governor's

02:26:35.270 --> 02:26:35.280 align:start position:0%
ranging from 25 million dollars
 
02:26:39.750 --> 02:26:39.760 align:start position:0%
allocated so far down to 84 000.
 
02:26:41.349 --> 02:26:41.359 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:26:42.950 --> 02:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
it's spent
 
02:26:46.469 --> 02:26:46.479 align:start position:0%
almost 50 million now but there is
 
02:26:49.110 --> 02:26:49.120 align:start position:0%
still money available
 
02:26:52.710 --> 02:26:52.720 align:start position:0%
that the governor hasn't allocated yet
 
02:26:52.720 --> 02:26:55.030 align:start position:0%
that the governor hasn't allocated yet
and

02:26:55.030 --> 02:26:55.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:26:56.630 --> 02:26:56.640 align:start position:0%
my question on
 
02:26:58.469 --> 02:26:58.479 align:start position:0%
this side of it
 
02:27:01.190 --> 02:27:01.200 align:start position:0%
is um
 
02:27:01.200 --> 02:27:02.469 align:start position:0%
is um
if

02:27:02.469 --> 02:27:02.479 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:27:02.479 --> 02:27:04.230 align:start position:0%
if
on

02:27:04.230 --> 02:27:04.240 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:27:09.590 --> 02:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:11.190 --> 02:27:11.200 align:start position:0%
from arpa
 
02:27:14.469 --> 02:27:14.479 align:start position:0%
to a non-lapsing fund
 
02:27:14.479 --> 02:27:15.990 align:start position:0%
to a non-lapsing fund
on

02:27:15.990 --> 02:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:27:18.950 --> 02:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
that would give some
 
02:27:22.870 --> 02:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
ability for the state to
 
02:27:25.750 --> 02:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
figure out a way to recover its revenue
 
02:27:28.070 --> 02:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
position which is
 
02:27:30.950 --> 02:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
very peculiar right now we have no idea
 
02:27:33.510 --> 02:27:33.520 align:start position:0%
whether we have a surplus or not we
 
02:27:35.510 --> 02:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
don't have a surplus in terms of what
 
02:27:39.910 --> 02:27:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:43.030 --> 02:27:43.040 align:start position:0%
immediately this year or is told by
 
02:27:44.870 --> 02:27:44.880 align:start position:0%
others that we ought to be doing
 
02:27:47.670 --> 02:27:47.680 align:start position:0%
immediately this year
 
02:27:50.309 --> 02:27:50.319 align:start position:0%
with the general funds so my question is
 
02:27:53.670 --> 02:27:53.680 align:start position:0%
i thought i'd made that clear was on
 
02:27:56.550 --> 02:27:56.560 align:start position:0%
do you see that being
 
02:27:59.670 --> 02:27:59.680 align:start position:0%
at least a temporary solution that could
 
02:28:03.910 --> 02:28:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:06.309 --> 02:28:06.319 align:start position:0%
i i suppose it could but i will ask you
 
02:28:09.270 --> 02:28:09.280 align:start position:0%
that i have an ask into arpa for
 
02:28:09.280 --> 02:28:10.870 align:start position:0%
that i have an ask into arpa for
um

02:28:10.870 --> 02:28:10.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:10.880 --> 02:28:12.550 align:start position:0%
um
capital

02:28:12.550 --> 02:28:12.560 align:start position:0%
capital
 
02:28:16.070 --> 02:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
already relative to food sustainability
 
02:28:20.070 --> 02:28:20.080 align:start position:0%
um we have many food hubs and and co-ops
 
02:28:21.349 --> 02:28:21.359 align:start position:0%
and i have
 
02:28:23.750 --> 02:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
working with with folks at
 
02:28:26.469 --> 02:28:26.479 align:start position:0%
uh unh and in all of these organizations
 
02:28:29.510 --> 02:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
we put in an ask for money for
 
02:28:32.230 --> 02:28:32.240 align:start position:0%
processing refrigeration packing
 
02:28:34.870 --> 02:28:34.880 align:start position:0%
transportation to be able to allow our
 
02:28:37.670 --> 02:28:37.680 align:start position:0%
small farms to come together and have an
 
02:28:40.309 --> 02:28:40.319 align:start position:0%
impact because right now in order to get
 
02:28:42.630 --> 02:28:42.640 align:start position:0%
into a market basket or demoulas or
 
02:28:45.270 --> 02:28:45.280 align:start position:0%
shaw's you need to have the the quantity
 
02:28:46.710 --> 02:28:46.720 align:start position:0%
of products
 
02:28:48.469 --> 02:28:48.479 align:start position:0%
and the ability to
 
02:28:48.479 --> 02:28:49.830 align:start position:0%
and the ability to
um

02:28:49.830 --> 02:28:49.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:52.150 --> 02:28:52.160 align:start position:0%
supply that throughout the year so
 
02:28:55.190 --> 02:28:55.200 align:start position:0%
that's where my focus has been um
 
02:28:58.230 --> 02:28:58.240 align:start position:0%
in this this particular case um
 
02:29:00.070 --> 02:29:00.080 align:start position:0%
you know currently
 
02:29:01.349 --> 02:29:01.359 align:start position:0%
on the books
 
02:29:02.950 --> 02:29:02.960 align:start position:0%
there is already
 
02:29:05.750 --> 02:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
a funding of the fairs
 
02:29:08.389 --> 02:29:08.399 align:start position:0%
but it's not been appropriated so my
 
02:29:10.870 --> 02:29:10.880 align:start position:0%
feeling is that if the legislature
 
02:29:12.389 --> 02:29:12.399 align:start position:0%
gets to the point where they feel we
 
02:29:14.309 --> 02:29:14.319 align:start position:0%
can't sustain this program
 
02:29:16.150 --> 02:29:16.160 align:start position:0%
they'll do exactly
 
02:29:17.910 --> 02:29:17.920 align:start position:0%
what's been done in the past and not
 
02:29:19.910 --> 02:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
appropriate anything in this statute
 
02:29:19.920 --> 02:29:21.270 align:start position:0%
appropriate anything in this statute
notwithstanding

02:29:21.270 --> 02:29:21.280 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding
 
02:29:24.550 --> 02:29:24.560 align:start position:0%
we'll have have a change as many do i
 
02:29:26.870 --> 02:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
think it's it's time to look to the long
 
02:29:26.880 --> 02:29:27.910 align:start position:0%
think it's it's time to look to the long
term

02:29:27.910 --> 02:29:27.920 align:start position:0%
term
 
02:29:29.830 --> 02:29:29.840 align:start position:0%
and not just the short term and so my
 
02:29:31.750 --> 02:29:31.760 align:start position:0%
ask is for a long term
 
02:29:34.070 --> 02:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
solution to a long-term product
 
02:29:36.230 --> 02:29:36.240 align:start position:0%
problem unlike my other ask which i
 
02:29:38.309 --> 02:29:38.319 align:start position:0%
think actually gets us off the ground
 
02:29:40.790 --> 02:29:40.800 align:start position:0%
provides what we need to establish that
 
02:29:42.710 --> 02:29:42.720 align:start position:0%
and then that in and of itself can be
 
02:29:44.710 --> 02:29:44.720 align:start position:0%
self-sustaining this is never something
 
02:29:47.910 --> 02:29:47.920 align:start position:0%
that will be self-sustaining
 
02:29:52.230 --> 02:29:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:53.670 --> 02:29:53.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you mr
 
02:29:55.590 --> 02:29:55.600 align:start position:0%
commissioner for taking my question i i
 
02:29:57.110 --> 02:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
guess my question
 
02:29:59.590 --> 02:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
comes around the idea of the fact that
 
02:30:01.190 --> 02:30:01.200 align:start position:0%
what we're really it sounds like what
 
02:30:02.950 --> 02:30:02.960 align:start position:0%
we're really asking is a reinvestment
 
02:30:05.030 --> 02:30:05.040 align:start position:0%
back in that the state benefits through
 
02:30:07.190 --> 02:30:07.200 align:start position:0%
tourism dollars through rooms and meals
 
02:30:08.870 --> 02:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
taxes that are collected
 
02:30:09.910 --> 02:30:09.920 align:start position:0%
i don't know how much you guys like
 
02:30:11.750 --> 02:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
funnel cake but i spent plenty of my
 
02:30:14.150 --> 02:30:14.160 align:start position:0%
fair share of money on funnel cake um
 
02:30:16.389 --> 02:30:16.399 align:start position:0%
even though it doesn't show i suppose um
 
02:30:17.910 --> 02:30:17.920 align:start position:0%
but anyway what we're really asking
 
02:30:19.830 --> 02:30:19.840 align:start position:0%
about is a reinvestment into these
 
02:30:21.270 --> 02:30:21.280 align:start position:0%
industries that are that are already
 
02:30:23.510 --> 02:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
providing tourism dollars into our state
 
02:30:25.510 --> 02:30:25.520 align:start position:0%
and and rooms and meals dollars into our
 
02:30:27.110 --> 02:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
state and to finally support them as
 
02:30:28.870 --> 02:30:28.880 align:start position:0%
part of the state program as they're
 
02:30:30.070 --> 02:30:30.080 align:start position:0%
sending money to the state is that what
 
02:30:31.670 --> 02:30:31.680 align:start position:0%
we're looking to
 
02:30:33.190 --> 02:30:33.200 align:start position:0%
i think you said that much better than i
 
02:30:35.670 --> 02:30:35.680 align:start position:0%
did thank you
 
02:30:38.389 --> 02:30:38.399 align:start position:0%
any further questions if not thank you

02:31:37.750 --> 02:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
where the food comes from exposure to a
 
02:31:40.150 --> 02:31:40.160 align:start position:0%
number of agricultural and forestry
 
02:31:41.990 --> 02:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
types of uh
 
02:31:44.710 --> 02:31:44.720 align:start position:0%
exhibits rule ways that type of thing
 
02:31:47.030 --> 02:31:47.040 align:start position:0%
but i think most importantly
 
02:31:48.630 --> 02:31:48.640 align:start position:0%
what the fears do
 
02:31:50.469 --> 02:31:50.479 align:start position:0%
is that they showcase
 
02:31:52.469 --> 02:31:52.479 align:start position:0%
the work of our youth
 
02:31:54.150 --> 02:31:54.160 align:start position:0%
which is very important it's very
 
02:31:56.309 --> 02:31:56.319 align:start position:0%
important to to our youngsters to have
 
02:31:58.230 --> 02:31:58.240 align:start position:0%
that exposure and it's something the
 
02:32:01.670 --> 02:32:01.680 align:start position:0%
fares do maybe better than anything
 
02:32:04.309 --> 02:32:04.319 align:start position:0%
again specifically to the bill is what
 
02:32:06.550 --> 02:32:06.560 align:start position:0%
we support and and representative lane
 
02:32:08.469 --> 02:32:08.479 align:start position:0%
can just basically just said it i guess
 
02:32:10.150 --> 02:32:10.160 align:start position:0%
is that it provides uh
 
02:32:11.990 --> 02:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
some funds a little part there that the
 
02:32:13.750 --> 02:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
fares can leverage
 
02:32:16.630 --> 02:32:16.640 align:start position:0%
for the purposes as as we've heard uh to
 
02:32:19.190 --> 02:32:19.200 align:start position:0%
make uh capital improvements
 
02:32:21.590 --> 02:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
uh uh deal with the challenges of many
 
02:32:23.110 --> 02:32:23.120 align:start position:0%
of them now operate basically on
 
02:32:26.230 --> 02:32:26.240 align:start position:0%
volunteer staffs that are
 
02:32:29.510 --> 02:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
more challenging to up to to obtain all
 
02:32:31.270 --> 02:32:31.280 align:start position:0%
the time
 
02:32:32.870 --> 02:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
in the interest of time mr cha i'll
 
02:32:35.110 --> 02:32:35.120 align:start position:0%
leave it at that but just
 
02:32:38.309 --> 02:32:38.319 align:start position:0%
with your permission i have a handout uh
 
02:32:39.830 --> 02:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
business new hampshire magazine about
 
02:32:41.830 --> 02:32:41.840 align:start position:0%
five years ago wrote a very pretty short
 
02:32:44.070 --> 02:32:44.080 align:start position:0%
piece and it does a good job i think of
 
02:32:45.830 --> 02:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
speaking to the challenges that we've
 
02:32:47.270 --> 02:32:47.280 align:start position:0%
mentioned here and i'll leave it at that
 
02:32:49.110 --> 02:32:49.120 align:start position:0%
and thank you for the opportunity well
 
02:32:50.950 --> 02:32:50.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony you take
 
02:32:50.960 --> 02:32:55.429 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony you take
questions

02:32:55.429 --> 02:32:55.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:55.439 --> 02:32:56.950 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:32:56.950 --> 02:32:56.960 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:33:01.510 --> 02:33:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:07.429 --> 02:33:07.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:09.190 --> 02:33:09.200 align:start position:0%
the next is
 
02:33:11.510 --> 02:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
a bob allen new hampshire fair
 
02:33:11.520 --> 02:33:12.950 align:start position:0%
a bob allen new hampshire fair
association

02:33:12.950 --> 02:33:12.960 align:start position:0%
association
 
02:33:21.270 --> 02:33:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:24.469 --> 02:33:24.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:27.429 --> 02:33:27.439 align:start position:0%
i did not come here with a
 
02:33:29.750 --> 02:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
prepared speech but i did want to speak
 
02:33:32.150 --> 02:33:32.160 align:start position:0%
to the committee i am currently the
 
02:33:34.150 --> 02:33:34.160 align:start position:0%
president of the new hampshire fair
 
02:33:34.160 --> 02:33:35.510 align:start position:0%
president of the new hampshire fair
association

02:33:35.510 --> 02:33:35.520 align:start position:0%
association
 
02:33:36.790 --> 02:33:36.800 align:start position:0%
which makes up
 
02:33:39.510 --> 02:33:39.520 align:start position:0%
the 11 fairs that we've talked about
 
02:33:42.950 --> 02:33:42.960 align:start position:0%
plus one festival i believe
 
02:33:45.910 --> 02:33:45.920 align:start position:0%
and i do know for a fact that each of
 
02:33:49.990 --> 02:33:50.000 align:start position:0%
the fairs that are able to qualify
 
02:33:51.750 --> 02:33:51.760 align:start position:0%
for these funds
 
02:33:55.110 --> 02:33:55.120 align:start position:0%
certainly have needs and uses for them
 
02:33:57.750 --> 02:33:57.760 align:start position:0%
and not all of them are here today
 
02:34:00.550 --> 02:34:00.560 align:start position:0%
i'm very familiar with cheshire
 
02:34:03.270 --> 02:34:03.280 align:start position:0%
cornish and i am a director and
 
02:34:05.429 --> 02:34:05.439 align:start position:0%
treasurer of huffington so i'm familiar
 
02:34:06.870 --> 02:34:06.880 align:start position:0%
with that fair
 
02:34:08.550 --> 02:34:08.560 align:start position:0%
very well as
 
02:34:10.550 --> 02:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
very well as well
 
02:34:13.270 --> 02:34:13.280 align:start position:0%
i have talked with some of the people at
 
02:34:15.590 --> 02:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
the fairs that are not represented today
 
02:34:17.590 --> 02:34:17.600 align:start position:0%
and they are certainly supportive of
 
02:34:18.790 --> 02:34:18.800 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:34:20.550 --> 02:34:20.560 align:start position:0%
although they couldn't all be here to
 
02:34:20.560 --> 02:34:22.389 align:start position:0%
although they couldn't all be here to
speak

02:34:22.389 --> 02:34:22.399 align:start position:0%
speak
 
02:34:22.399 --> 02:34:23.110 align:start position:0%
speak
so

02:34:23.110 --> 02:34:23.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:34:25.030 --> 02:34:25.040 align:start position:0%
in that regard i'm not going to speak
 
02:34:27.110 --> 02:34:27.120 align:start position:0%
for those fairs because i don't know
 
02:34:28.790 --> 02:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
their individual
 
02:34:31.349 --> 02:34:31.359 align:start position:0%
issues and problems but i can speak to
 
02:34:31.359 --> 02:34:32.230 align:start position:0%
issues and problems but i can speak to
the

02:34:32.230 --> 02:34:32.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:34:35.110 --> 02:34:35.120 align:start position:0%
issues at cheshire a little bit they are
 
02:34:38.070 --> 02:34:38.080 align:start position:0%
in dire need of some electrical upgrades
 
02:34:40.309 --> 02:34:40.319 align:start position:0%
they are in dire need of some bathroom
 
02:34:40.319 --> 02:34:41.910 align:start position:0%
they are in dire need of some bathroom
facilities

02:34:41.910 --> 02:34:41.920 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
02:34:44.469 --> 02:34:44.479 align:start position:0%
and probably other projects but those
 
02:34:46.630 --> 02:34:46.640 align:start position:0%
are two that i talked with gary davis
 
02:34:48.230 --> 02:34:48.240 align:start position:0%
who is the president
 
02:34:51.110 --> 02:34:51.120 align:start position:0%
about just recently this week
 
02:34:52.550 --> 02:34:52.560 align:start position:0%
at hopkinton
 
02:34:55.750 --> 02:34:55.760 align:start position:0%
a few years ago we did a very extensive
 
02:34:58.950 --> 02:34:58.960 align:start position:0%
electrical upgrade to the grounds
 
02:35:01.270 --> 02:35:01.280 align:start position:0%
it was somewhere in the vicinity of a
 
02:35:03.030 --> 02:35:03.040 align:start position:0%
half a million dollars
 
02:35:05.670 --> 02:35:05.680 align:start position:0%
we're still paying off that loan as we
 
02:35:07.030 --> 02:35:07.040 align:start position:0%
speak today
 
02:35:10.550 --> 02:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
but it was necessary to do in order to
 
02:35:13.590 --> 02:35:13.600 align:start position:0%
create safety through the electrical
 
02:35:15.670 --> 02:35:15.680 align:start position:0%
grid at hopkinton
 
02:35:16.870 --> 02:35:16.880 align:start position:0%
we have
 
02:35:19.830 --> 02:35:19.840 align:start position:0%
a project going right now that involves
 
02:35:23.110 --> 02:35:23.120 align:start position:0%
changing the lighting to led lights
 
02:35:25.750 --> 02:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
to help with the energy costs at the
 
02:35:27.429 --> 02:35:27.439 align:start position:0%
hopkinton fair
 
02:35:31.190 --> 02:35:31.200 align:start position:0%
and we do have a major issue with our
 
02:35:33.190 --> 02:35:33.200 align:start position:0%
bleachers i'll call them bleachers some
 
02:35:35.030 --> 02:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
people call them grandstands but they're
 
02:35:37.429 --> 02:35:37.439 align:start position:0%
really bleachers
 
02:35:40.630 --> 02:35:40.640 align:start position:0%
in meeting the codes and it's probably
 
02:35:42.550 --> 02:35:42.560 align:start position:0%
probably the only way that we're going
 
02:35:42.560 --> 02:35:43.590 align:start position:0%
probably the only way that we're going
to

02:35:43.590 --> 02:35:43.600 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:35:46.230 --> 02:35:46.240 align:start position:0%
meet those codes is to
 
02:35:47.510 --> 02:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
remove them
 
02:35:51.030 --> 02:35:51.040 align:start position:0%
and build new or do extensive
 
02:35:54.469 --> 02:35:54.479 align:start position:0%
renovations to the existing bleachers
 
02:35:57.190 --> 02:35:57.200 align:start position:0%
i've had a quote to replace the
 
02:35:57.200 --> 02:35:58.710 align:start position:0%
i've had a quote to replace the
bleachers

02:35:58.710 --> 02:35:58.720 align:start position:0%
bleachers
 
02:35:58.720 --> 02:36:00.150 align:start position:0%
bleachers
entirely

02:36:00.150 --> 02:36:00.160 align:start position:0%
entirely
 
02:36:02.309 --> 02:36:02.319 align:start position:0%
it's over a million dollars that's
 
02:36:04.469 --> 02:36:04.479 align:start position:0%
something that we can't afford and we
 
02:36:04.479 --> 02:36:05.349 align:start position:0%
something that we can't afford and we
can't

02:36:05.349 --> 02:36:05.359 align:start position:0%
can't
 
02:36:08.790 --> 02:36:08.800 align:start position:0%
you know even attempt to do so we will
 
02:36:08.800 --> 02:36:10.550 align:start position:0%
you know even attempt to do so we will
downsize

02:36:10.550 --> 02:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
downsize
 
02:36:11.670 --> 02:36:11.680 align:start position:0%
we will
 
02:36:14.790 --> 02:36:14.800 align:start position:0%
modify when and if necessary
 
02:36:17.349 --> 02:36:17.359 align:start position:0%
in order to meet the codes and hopefully
 
02:36:19.670 --> 02:36:19.680 align:start position:0%
we'll be able to continue to
 
02:36:22.710 --> 02:36:22.720 align:start position:0%
have a show
 
02:36:25.110 --> 02:36:25.120 align:start position:0%
large show in front of a
 
02:36:29.429 --> 02:36:29.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:31.830 --> 02:36:31.840 align:start position:0%
that said i don't have anything prepared
 
02:36:33.750 --> 02:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
but i would take any questions that you
 
02:36:36.550 --> 02:36:36.560 align:start position:0%
might have and turn it over to someone
 
02:36:36.560 --> 02:36:39.429 align:start position:0%
might have and turn it over to someone
else

02:36:39.429 --> 02:36:39.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:41.429 --> 02:36:41.439 align:start position:0%

yeah i'm from stratham so i understand
 
02:36:54.710 --> 02:36:54.720 align:start position:0%
what's going on in stratham um
 
02:36:56.630 --> 02:36:56.640 align:start position:0%
it's a tough it's a tough it gets
 
02:36:58.550 --> 02:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
tougher and tougher every year for fares
 
02:37:00.150 --> 02:37:00.160 align:start position:0%
i understand
 
02:37:00.160 --> 02:37:01.030 align:start position:0%
i understand
and

02:37:01.030 --> 02:37:01.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:37:03.429 --> 02:37:03.439 align:start position:0%
some years it's all about the weather
 
02:37:05.510 --> 02:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
right it's all about the weather if it's
 
02:37:08.950 --> 02:37:08.960 align:start position:0%
if it's rainy couple days you lose money
 
02:37:10.550 --> 02:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
if it's too hot
 
02:37:12.710 --> 02:37:12.720 align:start position:0%
you lose money if it's a little better
 
02:37:14.950 --> 02:37:14.960 align:start position:0%
than that you actually can
 
02:37:16.790 --> 02:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
make a few bucks and obviously that
 
02:37:19.349 --> 02:37:19.359 align:start position:0%
money gets reinvested into the fares
 
02:37:21.110 --> 02:37:21.120 align:start position:0%
uh i just want you to speak to that real
 
02:37:22.389 --> 02:37:22.399 align:start position:0%
quick i mean
 
02:37:24.710 --> 02:37:24.720 align:start position:0%
the efforts that are made i mean
 
02:37:26.870 --> 02:37:26.880 align:start position:0%
these aren't big profit making fares
 
02:37:28.870 --> 02:37:28.880 align:start position:0%
correct i mean they make some a good
 
02:37:28.880 --> 02:37:29.750 align:start position:0%
correct i mean they make some a good
year

02:37:29.750 --> 02:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
year
 
02:37:31.830 --> 02:37:31.840 align:start position:0%
they make some money they'll and there's
 
02:37:33.670 --> 02:37:33.680 align:start position:0%
boards i know that run these fairs that
 
02:37:35.270 --> 02:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
will make judgments as to where to put
 
02:37:36.230 --> 02:37:36.240 align:start position:0%
the money
 
02:37:37.910 --> 02:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
and making improvements because
 
02:37:39.670 --> 02:37:39.680 align:start position:0%
obviously improvements do happen without
 
02:37:40.630 --> 02:37:40.640 align:start position:0%
it but
 
02:37:41.910 --> 02:37:41.920 align:start position:0%
it just seems the last bunch of years
 
02:37:43.590 --> 02:37:43.600 align:start position:0%
it's been well first we didn't have a
 
02:37:45.750 --> 02:37:45.760 align:start position:0%
fair couple years because the covert
 
02:37:47.670 --> 02:37:47.680 align:start position:0%
and we decided not to reopen as a full
 
02:37:49.270 --> 02:37:49.280 align:start position:0%
fare we're not going to have the kearney
 
02:37:51.190 --> 02:37:51.200 align:start position:0%
rides this coming year we're going to
 
02:37:53.349 --> 02:37:53.359 align:start position:0%
have we want we want to preserve it for
 
02:37:54.550 --> 02:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
the 4-h
 
02:37:56.389 --> 02:37:56.399 align:start position:0%
folks still have all those all those
 
02:37:58.630 --> 02:37:58.640 align:start position:0%
things for the 4-h kids and all that but
 
02:38:00.550 --> 02:38:00.560 align:start position:0%
anyway but in terms of
 
02:38:02.550 --> 02:38:02.560 align:start position:0%
other sources of money namely the the
 
02:38:04.150 --> 02:38:04.160 align:start position:0%
fares making money
 
02:38:05.750 --> 02:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
to then put back into capital
 
02:38:07.910 --> 02:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
investments you can you speak to that
 
02:38:11.990 --> 02:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
uh yeah i can uh and to your points uh
 
02:38:13.190 --> 02:38:13.200 align:start position:0%
the weather
 
02:38:16.389 --> 02:38:16.399 align:start position:0%
a few years ago at hopkinton
 
02:38:18.550 --> 02:38:18.560 align:start position:0%
the weather forecast i believe it was
 
02:38:20.870 --> 02:38:20.880 align:start position:0%
for sunday was supposed to be in the 90s
 
02:38:22.870 --> 02:38:22.880 align:start position:0%
with high humidity
 
02:38:25.910 --> 02:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
on saturday of that day the crowds were
 
02:38:27.750 --> 02:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
enormous because they knew they were not
 
02:38:29.830 --> 02:38:29.840 align:start position:0%
going to be able to come on sundays so
 
02:38:31.910 --> 02:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
you've got a beautiful day it's hot and
 
02:38:34.630 --> 02:38:34.640 align:start position:0%
it's humid but people don't come the
 
02:38:36.710 --> 02:38:36.720 align:start position:0%
flip side of that is
 
02:38:38.950 --> 02:38:38.960 align:start position:0%
the weather forecasters can be our
 
02:38:42.550 --> 02:38:42.560 align:start position:0%
biggest enemies when they forecast rain
 
02:38:44.790 --> 02:38:44.800 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't occur people don't plan
 
02:38:46.950 --> 02:38:46.960 align:start position:0%
on coming so they don't come
 
02:38:49.830 --> 02:38:49.840 align:start position:0%
but in in terms of making money or
 
02:38:51.830 --> 02:38:51.840 align:start position:0%
reinvesting that money
 
02:38:54.630 --> 02:38:54.640 align:start position:0%
uh it's very difficult
 
02:38:57.990 --> 02:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
to spend all the money that you may make
 
02:39:00.150 --> 02:39:00.160 align:start position:0%
in any one year
 
02:39:03.270 --> 02:39:03.280 align:start position:0%
even though you know you have a capital
 
02:39:05.429 --> 02:39:05.439 align:start position:0%
project that needs to be done you have a
 
02:39:07.270 --> 02:39:07.280 align:start position:0%
barn roof that needs to be repaired
 
02:39:09.190 --> 02:39:09.200 align:start position:0%
whatever the case might be
 
02:39:10.389 --> 02:39:10.399 align:start position:0%
you're always
 
02:39:13.510 --> 02:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
looking at the coming year and we start
 
02:39:16.150 --> 02:39:16.160 align:start position:0%
this the month after our fair ends
 
02:39:19.190 --> 02:39:19.200 align:start position:0%
all right we need to be sure we can open
 
02:39:22.389 --> 02:39:22.399 align:start position:0%
the grounds next year so what can we do
 
02:39:24.469 --> 02:39:24.479 align:start position:0%
in the meantime between now and next
 
02:39:24.479 --> 02:39:25.349 align:start position:0%
in the meantime between now and next
year

02:39:25.349 --> 02:39:25.359 align:start position:0%
year
 
02:39:25.359 --> 02:39:26.389 align:start position:0%
year
to

02:39:26.389 --> 02:39:26.399 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:39:28.630 --> 02:39:28.640 align:start position:0%
to support the infrastructure that we
 
02:39:31.429 --> 02:39:31.439 align:start position:0%
already have and that's a difficult call
 
02:39:33.670 --> 02:39:33.680 align:start position:0%
to make because you never know what the
 
02:39:36.710 --> 02:39:36.720 align:start position:0%
weather's going to be come 2023 for
 
02:39:36.720 --> 02:39:38.389 align:start position:0%
weather's going to be come 2023 for
example

02:39:38.389 --> 02:39:38.399 align:start position:0%
example
 
02:39:38.399 --> 02:39:39.590 align:start position:0%
example
so

02:39:39.590 --> 02:39:39.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:39:39.600 --> 02:39:41.990 align:start position:0%
so
it's

02:39:41.990 --> 02:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:44.550 --> 02:39:44.560 align:start position:0%
it's something that you have to do but
 
02:39:46.230 --> 02:39:46.240 align:start position:0%
it's something that you have to be very
 
02:39:48.950 --> 02:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
cautious in doing as well because if you
 
02:39:51.190 --> 02:39:51.200 align:start position:0%
spend all of the funds that you make
 
02:39:52.710 --> 02:39:52.720 align:start position:0%
this year
 
02:39:55.429 --> 02:39:55.439 align:start position:0%
there may not be enough funds to to
 
02:39:57.910 --> 02:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
support the fair in the
 
02:40:00.070 --> 02:40:00.080 align:start position:0%
coming year in the following year
 
02:40:02.230 --> 02:40:02.240 align:start position:0%
because there are certain fixed expenses
 
02:40:04.550 --> 02:40:04.560 align:start position:0%
which have been talked about real estate
 
02:40:06.630 --> 02:40:06.640 align:start position:0%
taxes insurance
 
02:40:08.550 --> 02:40:08.560 align:start position:0%
payroll and things like that you have to
 
02:40:10.630 --> 02:40:10.640 align:start position:0%
be prepared to cover that
 
02:40:12.469 --> 02:40:12.479 align:start position:0%

02:40:31.030 --> 02:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
is there a town in each of the counties
 
02:40:33.429 --> 02:40:33.439 align:start position:0%

your knowledge do you know
i

02:40:37.110 --> 02:40:37.120 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:40:42.630 --> 02:40:42.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:44.950 --> 02:40:44.960 align:start position:0%
i don't know that i know that there is
 
02:40:47.670 --> 02:40:47.680 align:start position:0%
sandwich that's fair north available
 
02:40:50.469 --> 02:40:50.479 align:start position:0%

02:40:53.830 --> 02:40:53.840 align:start position:0%
fine all right and follow sir
 
02:40:56.870 --> 02:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
is there a state fair
 
02:41:01.030 --> 02:41:01.040 align:start position:0%
well the hopkinton state fair
 
02:41:04.710 --> 02:41:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:04.720 --> 02:41:05.750 align:start position:0%
 
however

02:41:05.750 --> 02:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
however
 
02:41:08.309 --> 02:41:08.319 align:start position:0%
people have said and thought that we
 
02:41:11.269 --> 02:41:11.279 align:start position:0%
received monies from the state that's
 
02:41:15.750 --> 02:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
not true it's simply a name that we
 
02:41:18.469 --> 02:41:18.479 align:start position:0%
you might say pirated once the plymouth
 
02:41:21.429 --> 02:41:21.439 align:start position:0%
state fair folded up
 
02:41:24.070 --> 02:41:24.080 align:start position:0%
we applied for that immediately
 
02:41:25.910 --> 02:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
the directors at the time i wasn't on
 
02:41:27.590 --> 02:41:27.600 align:start position:0%
the board but the directors at the time
 
02:41:30.309 --> 02:41:30.319 align:start position:0%
immediately applied for that designation
 
02:41:33.910 --> 02:41:33.920 align:start position:0%
but there is no money that goes with it
 
02:41:35.750 --> 02:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
from the state
 
02:41:35.760 --> 02:41:38.550 align:start position:0%
from the state
representative

02:41:38.550 --> 02:41:38.560 align:start position:0%

02:41:44.550 --> 02:41:44.560 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
02:41:46.710 --> 02:41:46.720 align:start position:0%
my question to you is actually i'm
 
02:41:50.870 --> 02:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
interested to hear your thoughts on
 
02:41:50.880 --> 02:41:51.990 align:start position:0%
interested to hear your thoughts on
how

02:41:51.990 --> 02:41:52.000 align:start position:0%
how
 
02:41:54.309 --> 02:41:54.319 align:start position:0%
any of these fairs
 
02:41:55.990 --> 02:41:56.000 align:start position:0%
may struggle
 
02:41:59.910 --> 02:41:59.920 align:start position:0%
with the expenses to incorporate
 
02:42:02.230 --> 02:42:02.240 align:start position:0%
ada accessibility
 
02:42:03.990 --> 02:42:04.000 align:start position:0%
on the fairgrounds
 
02:42:08.230 --> 02:42:08.240 align:start position:0%
and the costs associated with doing that
 
02:42:10.870 --> 02:42:10.880 align:start position:0%
well again i i can't speak for every
 
02:42:13.269 --> 02:42:13.279 align:start position:0%
fair and and what they're doing but i
 
02:42:13.279 --> 02:42:14.150 align:start position:0%
fair and and what they're doing but i
know

02:42:14.150 --> 02:42:14.160 align:start position:0%
know
 
02:42:16.550 --> 02:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
again at the hopkinton fair
 
02:42:21.110 --> 02:42:21.120 align:start position:0%
uh we have made all of our buildings uh
 
02:42:23.830 --> 02:42:23.840 align:start position:0%
handicapped accessible as much as we can
 
02:42:26.550 --> 02:42:26.560 align:start position:0%
we have provided in some of the enclosed
 
02:42:26.560 --> 02:42:28.790 align:start position:0%
we have provided in some of the enclosed
buildings

02:42:28.790 --> 02:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
buildings
 
02:42:28.800 --> 02:42:29.830 align:start position:0%
buildings
special

02:42:29.830 --> 02:42:29.840 align:start position:0%
special
 
02:42:31.990 --> 02:42:32.000 align:start position:0%
seating for the
 
02:42:35.510 --> 02:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
handicapped impaired wheelchair areas as
 
02:42:38.150 --> 02:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
well as lower seating on the bleachers
 
02:42:38.160 --> 02:42:38.950 align:start position:0%
well as lower seating on the bleachers
for

02:42:38.950 --> 02:42:38.960 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:42:41.269 --> 02:42:41.279 align:start position:0%
people that are mobile but can't climb a
 
02:42:44.150 --> 02:42:44.160 align:start position:0%
set of bleachers or stairs or whatever
 
02:42:47.510 --> 02:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
so i know at our fair we are
 
02:42:49.910 --> 02:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
i think we are 100
 
02:42:53.349 --> 02:42:53.359 align:start position:0%
compliant with with people being able to
 
02:42:55.429 --> 02:42:55.439 align:start position:0%
access all of the buildings
 
02:42:57.590 --> 02:42:57.600 align:start position:0%
uh there and i'm sure the other fairs
 
02:42:59.750 --> 02:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
are are doing similar things
 
02:43:02.309 --> 02:43:02.319 align:start position:0%
but i can't speak to them directly
 
02:43:04.150 --> 02:43:04.160 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
02:43:07.429 --> 02:43:07.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:09.990 --> 02:43:10.000 align:start position:0%
the neck thank you very much okay
 
02:43:11.349 --> 02:43:11.359 align:start position:0%
next is
 
02:43:19.030 --> 02:43:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:23.990 --> 02:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:26.070 --> 02:43:26.080 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you
 
02:43:28.150 --> 02:43:28.160 align:start position:0%
you would all probably know us better as
 
02:43:30.550 --> 02:43:30.560 align:start position:0%
rochester fair
 
02:43:33.510 --> 02:43:33.520 align:start position:0%
last week we lost a 40-stall barn to
 
02:43:33.520 --> 02:43:34.870 align:start position:0%
last week we lost a 40-stall barn to
fire

02:43:34.870 --> 02:43:34.880 align:start position:0%
fire
 
02:43:37.269 --> 02:43:37.279 align:start position:0%
it was uninsured
 
02:43:37.279 --> 02:43:38.150 align:start position:0%
it was uninsured
and

02:43:38.150 --> 02:43:38.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:43:39.349 --> 02:43:39.359 align:start position:0%
we are going to have to do some
 
02:43:39.359 --> 02:43:41.030 align:start position:0%
we are going to have to do some
rebuilding

02:43:41.030 --> 02:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
rebuilding
 
02:43:41.040 --> 02:43:42.790 align:start position:0%
rebuilding
however

02:43:42.790 --> 02:43:42.800 align:start position:0%
however
 
02:43:45.110 --> 02:43:45.120 align:start position:0%
when you rebuild something you have to
 
02:43:48.870 --> 02:43:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:50.550 --> 02:43:50.560 align:start position:0%
and that's going to involve
 
02:43:53.110 --> 02:43:53.120 align:start position:0%
in our town putting a sprinkler system
 
02:43:53.120 --> 02:43:53.910 align:start position:0%
in our town putting a sprinkler system
in

02:43:53.910 --> 02:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:43:55.910 --> 02:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
which is going to cost more
 
02:43:58.469 --> 02:43:58.479 align:start position:0%
than the barn will itself
 
02:44:00.230 --> 02:44:00.240 align:start position:0%
these are challenges
 
02:44:02.950 --> 02:44:02.960 align:start position:0%
that the fares face
 
02:44:04.550 --> 02:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
you know um
 
02:44:06.389 --> 02:44:06.399 align:start position:0%
the fairs have
 
02:44:09.349 --> 02:44:09.359 align:start position:0%
only a couple real sources of revenue
 
02:44:10.870 --> 02:44:10.880 align:start position:0%
your admission is usually your number
 
02:44:10.880 --> 02:44:12.550 align:start position:0%
your admission is usually your number
one

02:44:12.550 --> 02:44:12.560 align:start position:0%
one
 
02:44:15.830 --> 02:44:15.840 align:start position:0%
your carnival is your second
 
02:44:18.710 --> 02:44:18.720 align:start position:0%
you have to take that money and that's
 
02:44:22.950 --> 02:44:22.960 align:start position:0%
what funds things like exhibitions
 
02:44:26.790 --> 02:44:26.800 align:start position:0%
the crafts the animals all of those are
 
02:44:28.630 --> 02:44:28.640 align:start position:0%
expenses to the fair
 
02:44:31.349 --> 02:44:31.359 align:start position:0%
we have very little income
 
02:44:34.550 --> 02:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
that is reaching out to pay
 
02:44:37.030 --> 02:44:37.040 align:start position:0%
all of the outgo of maintaining old
 
02:44:37.040 --> 02:44:38.150 align:start position:0%
all of the outgo of maintaining old
buildings

02:44:38.150 --> 02:44:38.160 align:start position:0%
buildings
 
02:44:41.510 --> 02:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
we have a large old victorian style
 
02:44:43.190 --> 02:44:43.200 align:start position:0%
exhibition building
 
02:44:45.510 --> 02:44:45.520 align:start position:0%
and it's a constant work
 
02:44:48.150 --> 02:44:48.160 align:start position:0%
in progress to maintain
 
02:44:50.950 --> 02:44:50.960 align:start position:0%
and to bring up to codes
 
02:44:53.030 --> 02:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
for many years the fairs
 
02:44:53.040 --> 02:44:54.070 align:start position:0%
for many years the fairs
didn't

02:44:54.070 --> 02:44:54.080 align:start position:0%
didn't
 
02:44:54.080 --> 02:44:55.670 align:start position:0%
didn't
necessarily

02:44:55.670 --> 02:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
necessarily
 
02:44:57.110 --> 02:44:57.120 align:start position:0%
have to
 
02:44:59.110 --> 02:44:59.120 align:start position:0%
bring stuff up to code that was kind of
 
02:44:59.120 --> 02:45:00.389 align:start position:0%
bring stuff up to code that was kind of
ignored

02:45:00.389 --> 02:45:00.399 align:start position:0%
ignored
 
02:45:02.790 --> 02:45:02.800 align:start position:0%
and now there's been a real push for
 
02:45:05.590 --> 02:45:05.600 align:start position:0%
handicap accessibility electrical work
 
02:45:08.630 --> 02:45:08.640 align:start position:0%
we've all we've all faced that
 
02:45:10.790 --> 02:45:10.800 align:start position:0%
many parts of the country
 
02:45:13.190 --> 02:45:13.200 align:start position:0%
you hear the talk of county fair or
 
02:45:14.469 --> 02:45:14.479 align:start position:0%
state fair
 
02:45:17.429 --> 02:45:17.439 align:start position:0%
that usually designates a fair that gets
 
02:45:19.910 --> 02:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
financial support from the county or the
 
02:45:19.920 --> 02:45:21.030 align:start position:0%
financial support from the county or the
state

02:45:21.030 --> 02:45:21.040 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:45:22.950 --> 02:45:22.960 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire the fairs are
 
02:45:22.960 --> 02:45:25.349 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire the fairs are
self-supporting

02:45:25.349 --> 02:45:25.359 align:start position:0%
self-supporting
 
02:45:26.389 --> 02:45:26.399 align:start position:0%
and it's
 
02:45:29.670 --> 02:45:29.680 align:start position:0%
just something that you're not able to
 
02:45:32.469 --> 02:45:32.479 align:start position:0%
sustain anymore
 
02:45:34.150 --> 02:45:34.160 align:start position:0%
most of the
 
02:45:37.750 --> 02:45:37.760 align:start position:0%
help and sponsorship of the fairs
 
02:45:39.269 --> 02:45:39.279 align:start position:0%
came from
 
02:45:41.830 --> 02:45:41.840 align:start position:0%
the agricultural industries
 
02:45:45.110 --> 02:45:45.120 align:start position:0%
because we were agricultural fares
 
02:45:46.790 --> 02:45:46.800 align:start position:0%
i'm a dairy farmer in the state of new
 
02:45:46.800 --> 02:45:48.070 align:start position:0%
i'm a dairy farmer in the state of new
hampshire

02:45:48.070 --> 02:45:48.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:45:51.510 --> 02:45:51.520 align:start position:0%
when i started in 1974 there were 650
 
02:45:55.510 --> 02:45:55.520 align:start position:0%
dairy farms shipping milk less than 100
 
02:45:55.520 --> 02:45:57.510 align:start position:0%
dairy farms shipping milk less than 100
today

02:45:57.510 --> 02:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
today
 
02:45:59.910 --> 02:45:59.920 align:start position:0%
that pool of people who are going to
 
02:46:01.990 --> 02:46:02.000 align:start position:0%
sponsor the fares has gotten smaller and
 
02:46:02.000 --> 02:46:03.030 align:start position:0%
sponsor the fares has gotten smaller and
smaller

02:46:03.030 --> 02:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
smaller
 
02:46:06.870 --> 02:46:06.880 align:start position:0%
and we reach out to whoever we have
 
02:46:09.429 --> 02:46:09.439 align:start position:0%
but there's just so many dollars
 
02:46:11.910 --> 02:46:11.920 align:start position:0%
and with agriculture exiting
 
02:46:14.790 --> 02:46:14.800 align:start position:0%
the northeast as rapidly as it is
 
02:46:17.110 --> 02:46:17.120 align:start position:0%
we no longer have the pool of people to
 
02:46:19.910 --> 02:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
go after for sponsorship
 
02:46:22.469 --> 02:46:22.479 align:start position:0%
i am old enough to remember
 
02:46:25.349 --> 02:46:25.359 align:start position:0%
when the fairs had a stipend fund and it
 
02:46:27.190 --> 02:46:27.200 align:start position:0%
was very helpful
 
02:46:27.200 --> 02:46:28.230 align:start position:0%
was very helpful
um

02:46:28.230 --> 02:46:28.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:46:30.630 --> 02:46:30.640 align:start position:0%
you know other states do
 
02:46:33.110 --> 02:46:33.120 align:start position:0%
maine and vermont have have a program
 
02:46:36.469 --> 02:46:36.479 align:start position:0%
similar and it's been very beneficial
 
02:46:37.990 --> 02:46:38.000 align:start position:0%
so i hope you i hope you folks can
 
02:46:39.830 --> 02:46:39.840 align:start position:0%
support that
 
02:46:41.269 --> 02:46:41.279 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for testimony
 
02:46:43.429 --> 02:46:43.439 align:start position:0%

02:46:51.030 --> 02:46:51.040 align:start position:0%
other fairs that have prairie mutual
 
02:46:53.429 --> 02:46:53.439 align:start position:0%

02:46:56.710 --> 02:46:56.720 align:start position:0%
we ended uh paramutual in 2007 after
 
02:46:59.670 --> 02:46:59.680 align:start position:0%
it's been a while losing years okay
 
02:47:02.230 --> 02:47:02.240 align:start position:0%
we were only we were one of only three
 
02:47:04.870 --> 02:47:04.880 align:start position:0%
fairs in the state of new hampshire that
 
02:47:07.429 --> 02:47:07.439 align:start position:0%
ever had paramutual
 
02:47:09.830 --> 02:47:09.840 align:start position:0%
and that was plymouth and at one time
 
02:47:12.309 --> 02:47:12.319 align:start position:0%
there was a fair in pittsfield that had
 
02:47:14.550 --> 02:47:14.560 align:start position:0%
paramutual okay thank you so that's not
 
02:47:16.550 --> 02:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
a revenue stream at all okay thank you
 
02:47:18.070 --> 02:47:18.080 align:start position:0%

if the state were to go ahead with this
 
02:47:29.439 --> 02:47:31.750 align:start position:0%
if the state were to go ahead with this
appropriation

02:47:31.750 --> 02:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
appropriation
 
02:47:33.670 --> 02:47:33.680 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that your barn was
 
02:47:33.680 --> 02:47:34.870 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that your barn was
uninsured

02:47:34.870 --> 02:47:34.880 align:start position:0%
uninsured
 
02:47:37.190 --> 02:47:37.200 align:start position:0%
will the county will these
 
02:47:39.429 --> 02:47:39.439 align:start position:0%
fairgrounds have to have insurance i
 
02:47:41.110 --> 02:47:41.120 align:start position:0%
don't know if the other ones have
 
02:47:43.830 --> 02:47:43.840 align:start position:0%
insurance on their property
 
02:47:45.830 --> 02:47:45.840 align:start position:0%
like your buildings
 
02:47:47.510 --> 02:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
i can speak to the insurance in
 
02:47:47.520 --> 02:47:48.550 align:start position:0%
i can speak to the insurance in
rochester

02:47:48.550 --> 02:47:48.560 align:start position:0%
rochester
 
02:47:50.150 --> 02:47:50.160 align:start position:0%
all of our
 
02:47:53.269 --> 02:47:53.279 align:start position:0%
newer buildings are insured some of the
 
02:47:55.269 --> 02:47:55.279 align:start position:0%
older barns they deemed
 
02:47:57.429 --> 02:47:57.439 align:start position:0%
uninsurable because they're hard to
 
02:47:57.439 --> 02:47:59.670 align:start position:0%
uninsurable because they're hard to
secure

02:47:59.670 --> 02:47:59.680 align:start position:0%
secure
 
02:48:01.510 --> 02:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
we do shut the electricity off in the
 
02:48:04.070 --> 02:48:04.080 align:start position:0%
winter but thank you um most of our
 
02:48:06.070 --> 02:48:06.080 align:start position:0%
newer buildings are insured
 
02:48:08.550 --> 02:48:08.560 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
02:48:10.630 --> 02:48:10.640 align:start position:0%

kirk i live in the town of where but i'm
 
02:48:33.349 --> 02:48:33.359 align:start position:0%
here representing granite state
 
02:48:35.510 --> 02:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
taxpayers some of you may know that i
 
02:48:37.110 --> 02:48:37.120 align:start position:0%
was a state representative for many
 
02:48:37.120 --> 02:48:40.870 align:start position:0%
was a state representative for many
years

02:48:40.870 --> 02:48:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:42.469 --> 02:48:42.479 align:start position:0%
granite state taxpayers is new
 
02:48:44.710 --> 02:48:44.720 align:start position:0%
hampshire's oldest statewide taxpayer
 
02:48:46.630 --> 02:48:46.640 align:start position:0%
advocacy group
 
02:48:49.110 --> 02:48:49.120 align:start position:0%
it was founded in 1990 by the
 
02:48:50.870 --> 02:48:50.880 align:start position:0%
late governor mel thompson and the late
 
02:48:55.269 --> 02:48:55.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:57.349 --> 02:48:57.359 align:start position:0%
granite state taxpayers opposes this
 
02:49:00.150 --> 02:49:00.160 align:start position:0%
bill for four reasons
 
02:49:02.710 --> 02:49:02.720 align:start position:0%
first it's special interest legislation
 
02:49:04.870 --> 02:49:04.880 align:start position:0%
taxpayers are being asked to subsidize a
 
02:49:07.030 --> 02:49:07.040 align:start position:0%
specific set of businesses
 
02:49:07.040 --> 02:49:08.070 align:start position:0%
specific set of businesses
although

02:49:08.070 --> 02:49:08.080 align:start position:0%
although
 
02:49:10.309 --> 02:49:10.319 align:start position:0%
largely non-profit and serving a very
 
02:49:12.150 --> 02:49:12.160 align:start position:0%
important agricultural industry in our
 
02:49:13.590 --> 02:49:13.600 align:start position:0%
state these fares
 
02:49:16.070 --> 02:49:16.080 align:start position:0%
do in fact have a source of income and
 
02:49:18.469 --> 02:49:18.479 align:start position:0%
should be self-supporting
 
02:49:20.550 --> 02:49:20.560 align:start position:0%
those fares that are profitable such as
 
02:49:20.560 --> 02:49:21.830 align:start position:0%
those fares that are profitable such as
deerfield

02:49:21.830 --> 02:49:21.840 align:start position:0%
deerfield
 
02:49:23.750 --> 02:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
can finance their capital improvements
 
02:49:26.150 --> 02:49:26.160 align:start position:0%
through bank loans they needn't rely on
 
02:49:26.160 --> 02:49:27.910 align:start position:0%
through bank loans they needn't rely on
taxpayers

02:49:27.910 --> 02:49:27.920 align:start position:0%
taxpayers
 
02:49:29.750 --> 02:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
those fares that are not profitable
 
02:49:32.550 --> 02:49:32.560 align:start position:0%
should raise their admission and other
 
02:49:34.309 --> 02:49:34.319 align:start position:0%
sources of income

or sad to say
 
02:49:38.710 --> 02:49:38.720 align:start position:0%
cease operations
 
02:49:42.150 --> 02:49:42.160 align:start position:0%
number two a state subsidy for a dying
 
02:49:45.030 --> 02:49:45.040 align:start position:0%
business even those that may enjoy
 
02:49:46.950 --> 02:49:46.960 align:start position:0%
and help an industry that's important to
 
02:49:50.070 --> 02:49:50.080 align:start position:0%
our state is not in the public interest
 
02:49:52.070 --> 02:49:52.080 align:start position:0%
unless the proponents can demonstrate
 
02:49:53.830 --> 02:49:53.840 align:start position:0%
that the capital improvements will
 
02:49:56.790 --> 02:49:56.800 align:start position:0%
generate an increase in state tax
 
02:49:56.800 --> 02:49:57.910 align:start position:0%
generate an increase in state tax
revenues

02:49:57.910 --> 02:49:57.920 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
02:49:59.670 --> 02:49:59.680 align:start position:0%
over their useful life
 
02:50:02.550 --> 02:50:02.560 align:start position:0%
exceeding the cost to the state of the
 
02:50:02.560 --> 02:50:05.830 align:start position:0%
exceeding the cost to the state of the
project

02:50:05.830 --> 02:50:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:08.469 --> 02:50:08.479 align:start position:0%
three the grant program will do nothing
 
02:50:10.389 --> 02:50:10.399 align:start position:0%
to deal with the fundamental problem
 
02:50:12.550 --> 02:50:12.560 align:start position:0%
facing agricultural fares their
 
02:50:14.230 --> 02:50:14.240 align:start position:0%
diminishing appeal to the younger
 
02:50:16.710 --> 02:50:16.720 align:start position:0%
generation and the challenge of keeping
 
02:50:19.030 --> 02:50:19.040 align:start position:0%
fares relevant amidst trends of
 
02:50:22.150 --> 02:50:22.160 align:start position:0%
declining involvement in agriculture
 
02:50:25.590 --> 02:50:25.600 align:start position:0%
there are many studies to this effect
 
02:50:25.600 --> 02:50:26.550 align:start position:0%
there are many studies to this effect
fourth

02:50:26.550 --> 02:50:26.560 align:start position:0%
fourth
 
02:50:28.950 --> 02:50:28.960 align:start position:0%
beyond all of those basic points there
 
02:50:30.790 --> 02:50:30.800 align:start position:0%
are some practical and constitutional
 
02:50:34.469 --> 02:50:34.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:36.950 --> 02:50:36.960 align:start position:0%
the bill delegates rulemaking to the
 
02:50:36.960 --> 02:50:38.950 align:start position:0%
the bill delegates rulemaking to the
commissioner

02:50:38.950 --> 02:50:38.960 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
02:50:40.550 --> 02:50:40.560 align:start position:0%
but under our constitution in the
 
02:50:42.389 --> 02:50:42.399 align:start position:0%
federal constitution
 
02:50:43.830 --> 02:50:43.840 align:start position:0%
where we have
 
02:50:46.150 --> 02:50:46.160 align:start position:0%
separation of powers the three branches
 
02:50:47.429 --> 02:50:47.439 align:start position:0%
of government
 
02:50:50.550 --> 02:50:50.560 align:start position:0%
the legislative branch cannot delegate
 
02:50:52.630 --> 02:50:52.640 align:start position:0%
legislative authority to the executive
 
02:50:57.110 --> 02:50:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:00.550 --> 02:51:00.560 align:start position:0%
house bill 1584 violates this precept in
 
02:51:02.150 --> 02:51:02.160 align:start position:0%
two provisions
 
02:51:04.469 --> 02:51:04.479 align:start position:0%
first with respect to the basic grant
 
02:51:06.550 --> 02:51:06.560 align:start position:0%
that's the one for buildings
 
02:51:10.070 --> 02:51:10.080 align:start position:0%
the criteria are laid out in section 426
 
02:51:12.150 --> 02:51:12.160 align:start position:0%
b 5 2
 
02:51:14.309 --> 02:51:14.319 align:start position:0%
but not their weights
 
02:51:15.830 --> 02:51:15.840 align:start position:0%
so for example
 
02:51:18.550 --> 02:51:18.560 align:start position:0%
is having high gate receipts gate
 
02:51:20.550 --> 02:51:20.560 align:start position:0%
receipts being one of the criteria that
 
02:51:23.190 --> 02:51:23.200 align:start position:0%
the commissioners to consider a positive
 
02:51:24.870 --> 02:51:24.880 align:start position:0%
or a negative
 
02:51:26.150 --> 02:51:26.160 align:start position:0%
that depends upon whether the
 
02:51:29.349 --> 02:51:29.359 align:start position:0%
commissioner not the legislature
 
02:51:31.750 --> 02:51:31.760 align:start position:0%
decides that the grant program is to be
 
02:51:34.469 --> 02:51:34.479 align:start position:0%
income tested
 
02:51:36.790 --> 02:51:36.800 align:start position:0%
that's a legislative decision
 
02:51:38.550 --> 02:51:38.560 align:start position:0%
you folks need to decide that you can't
 
02:51:40.790 --> 02:51:40.800 align:start position:0%
leave it the way it is in the bill
 
02:51:44.230 --> 02:51:44.240 align:start position:0%
and then the commissioner is given
 
02:51:47.190 --> 02:51:47.200 align:start position:0%
the exception power that's on page two
 
02:51:48.790 --> 02:51:48.800 align:start position:0%
line seven and eight it was discussed
 
02:51:48.800 --> 02:51:50.070 align:start position:0%
line seven and eight it was discussed
before

02:51:50.070 --> 02:51:50.080 align:start position:0%
before
 
02:51:52.230 --> 02:51:52.240 align:start position:0%
without any criteria
 
02:51:54.630 --> 02:51:54.640 align:start position:0%
so the commissioner in effect is being
 
02:51:56.630 --> 02:51:56.640 align:start position:0%
granted the power that the legislator
 
02:51:58.710 --> 02:51:58.720 align:start position:0%
legislature has and must use to
 
02:52:02.790 --> 02:52:02.800 align:start position:0%
legislate that can't stand without
 
02:52:05.349 --> 02:52:05.359 align:start position:0%
some sort of criteria indicating
 
02:52:07.269 --> 02:52:07.279 align:start position:0%
exceptions for what based on what
 
02:52:07.279 --> 02:52:08.790 align:start position:0%
exceptions for what based on what
criteria

02:52:08.790 --> 02:52:08.800 align:start position:0%
criteria
 
02:52:08.800 --> 02:52:09.910 align:start position:0%
criteria
secondly

02:52:09.910 --> 02:52:09.920 align:start position:0%
secondly
 
02:52:12.150 --> 02:52:12.160 align:start position:0%
there's a second part of this uh grant
 
02:52:14.870 --> 02:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
program called the health improvements
 
02:52:16.469 --> 02:52:16.479 align:start position:0%
part of the program
 
02:52:16.479 --> 02:52:18.950 align:start position:0%
part of the program
that's

02:52:18.950 --> 02:52:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:21.030 --> 02:52:21.040 align:start position:0%
426 b
 
02:52:21.040 --> 02:52:23.269 align:start position:0%
426 b

02:52:23.269 --> 02:52:23.279 align:start position:0%

02:52:25.750 --> 02:52:25.760 align:start position:0%
comma i

02:52:43.830 --> 02:52:43.840 align:start position:0%
two that would be page two lines
 
02:52:43.840 --> 02:52:47.670 align:start position:0%
two that would be page two lines
um

02:52:47.670 --> 02:52:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:52.389 --> 02:52:52.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:54.870 --> 02:52:54.880 align:start position:0%
ah yes thank you page three
 
02:52:54.880 --> 02:52:56.870 align:start position:0%
ah yes thank you page three
um

02:52:56.870 --> 02:52:56.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:53:00.469 --> 02:53:00.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:03.910 --> 02:53:03.920 align:start position:0%
yes page three lines four through six
 
02:53:05.670 --> 02:53:05.680 align:start position:0%
subject to the availability of funds the
 
02:53:07.830 --> 02:53:07.840 align:start position:0%
department may provide grant funds on a
 
02:53:09.750 --> 02:53:09.760 align:start position:0%
competitive basis to support capital
 
02:53:12.389 --> 02:53:12.399 align:start position:0%
projects that make health and safety
 
02:53:16.230 --> 02:53:16.240 align:start position:0%
improvements to agricultural fares etc
 
02:53:17.990 --> 02:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
there are absolutely no criteria
 
02:53:23.190 --> 02:53:23.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:25.269 --> 02:53:25.279 align:start position:0%
if the bill is to go forward and granite
 
02:53:27.590 --> 02:53:27.600 align:start position:0%
state taxpayers does not wish it to go
 
02:53:27.600 --> 02:53:28.790 align:start position:0%
state taxpayers does not wish it to go
forward

02:53:28.790 --> 02:53:28.800 align:start position:0%
forward
 
02:53:30.309 --> 02:53:30.319 align:start position:0%
somebody needs to figure out what the
 
02:53:32.710 --> 02:53:32.720 align:start position:0%
criteria are and put them into the bill
 
02:53:35.269 --> 02:53:35.279 align:start position:0%
otherwise i think you've delegated
 
02:53:37.590 --> 02:53:37.600 align:start position:0%
legislative authority unconstitutionally
 
02:53:40.309 --> 02:53:40.319 align:start position:0%
to the executive branch
 
02:53:44.070 --> 02:53:44.080 align:start position:0%
for these reasons mr chairman
 
02:53:46.309 --> 02:53:46.319 align:start position:0%
granite state taxpayers asks that you
 
02:53:46.319 --> 02:53:47.190 align:start position:0%
granite state taxpayers asks that you
either

02:53:47.190 --> 02:53:47.200 align:start position:0%
either
 
02:53:49.750 --> 02:53:49.760 align:start position:0%
itl the bill or refer it for interim
 
02:53:49.760 --> 02:53:50.710 align:start position:0%
itl the bill or refer it for interim
study

02:53:50.710 --> 02:53:50.720 align:start position:0%
study
 
02:53:52.630 --> 02:53:52.640 align:start position:0%
that concludes my testimony mr chairman
 
02:53:55.429 --> 02:53:55.439 align:start position:0%
i'd be pleased to answer any questions
 
02:53:58.870 --> 02:53:58.880 align:start position:0%

02:54:15.200 --> 02:54:16.230 align:start position:0%
workforce
um

02:54:16.230 --> 02:54:16.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:54:18.309 --> 02:54:18.319 align:start position:0%
oh you're always you're the honorable it
 
02:54:19.750 --> 02:54:19.760 align:start position:0%
never goes away
 
02:54:21.910 --> 02:54:21.920 align:start position:0%
so that first read the first on the
 
02:54:23.670 --> 02:54:23.680 align:start position:0%
constitutional thing you mentioned can
 
02:54:25.190 --> 02:54:25.200 align:start position:0%
you tell us again page and i missed that
 
02:54:26.790 --> 02:54:26.800 align:start position:0%
one page and uh
 
02:54:26.800 --> 02:54:28.950 align:start position:0%
one page and uh
and

02:54:28.950 --> 02:54:28.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:54:28.960 --> 02:54:29.910 align:start position:0%
and
um

02:54:29.910 --> 02:54:29.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:54:32.710 --> 02:54:32.720 align:start position:0%
426 b52
 
02:54:36.309 --> 02:54:36.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:39.269 --> 02:54:39.279 align:start position:0%
4 26
 
02:54:39.279 --> 02:54:40.150 align:start position:0%
4 26
5

02:54:40.150 --> 02:54:40.160 align:start position:0%
5
 
02:54:42.790 --> 02:54:42.800 align:start position:0%
2. that starts on
 
02:54:42.800 --> 02:54:46.950 align:start position:0%
2. that starts on
29

02:54:46.950 --> 02:54:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:49.510 --> 02:54:49.520 align:start position:0%
and specifically
 
02:54:51.830 --> 02:54:51.840 align:start position:0%
line 31 this merit rating shall take
 
02:54:53.910 --> 02:54:53.920 align:start position:0%
into account such factors as and there's
 
02:54:55.910 --> 02:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
a whole list of things there
 
02:54:55.920 --> 02:54:57.030 align:start position:0%
a whole list of things there
including

02:54:57.030 --> 02:54:57.040 align:start position:0%
including
 
02:55:01.750 --> 02:55:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:04.389 --> 02:55:04.399 align:start position:0%
so with what you've done is to say uh
 
02:55:06.230 --> 02:55:06.240 align:start position:0%
commissioner jasper you have to consider
 
02:55:07.830 --> 02:55:07.840 align:start position:0%
all of these things
 
02:55:09.990 --> 02:55:10.000 align:start position:0%
but the bill doesn't say what waits to
 
02:55:11.670 --> 02:55:11.680 align:start position:0%
give and what the meaning is and the
 
02:55:13.910 --> 02:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
commissioner can make this program
 
02:55:16.790 --> 02:55:16.800 align:start position:0%
an income-tested program or open to
 
02:55:17.990 --> 02:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
everybody regardless of the
 
02:55:20.070 --> 02:55:20.080 align:start position:0%
profitability of the fair
 
02:55:22.469 --> 02:55:22.479 align:start position:0%
there are just no criteria for him to
 
02:55:23.910 --> 02:55:23.920 align:start position:0%
make a decision
 
02:55:25.910 --> 02:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
and therefore um
 
02:55:28.710 --> 02:55:28.720 align:start position:0%
that's unconstitutional you you folks as
 
02:55:30.630 --> 02:55:30.640 align:start position:0%
legislators have to say
 
02:55:33.030 --> 02:55:33.040 align:start position:0%
what it is you you can't give the
 
02:55:36.469 --> 02:55:36.479 align:start position:0%
executive branch um regulation writing
 
02:55:39.990 --> 02:55:40.000 align:start position:0%
authority and create the program
 
02:55:41.510 --> 02:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
on its own
 
02:55:43.590 --> 02:55:43.600 align:start position:0%
you've you've got to be more specific
 
02:55:45.670 --> 02:55:45.680 align:start position:0%
and set the criteria what is the program
 
02:55:48.550 --> 02:55:48.560 align:start position:0%
to be can the deerfield fair get money
 
02:55:50.389 --> 02:55:50.399 align:start position:0%
even if it's profitable or do you want
 
02:55:52.710 --> 02:55:52.720 align:start position:0%
to reserve the money just affairs that
 
02:55:54.870 --> 02:55:54.880 align:start position:0%
are losing money and that are might go
 
02:55:56.870 --> 02:55:56.880 align:start position:0%
out of existence
 
02:55:59.030 --> 02:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
whatever whatever the decision is it's a
 
02:56:01.190 --> 02:56:01.200 align:start position:0%
legislative decision and not an
 
02:56:03.190 --> 02:56:03.200 align:start position:0%
executive branch decision the way the
 
02:56:04.710 --> 02:56:04.720 align:start position:0%
bill is set up
 
02:56:06.309 --> 02:56:06.319 align:start position:0%
the decision is left to the executive
 
02:56:06.319 --> 02:56:07.429 align:start position:0%
the decision is left to the executive
branch

02:56:07.429 --> 02:56:07.439 align:start position:0%
branch
 
02:56:13.510 --> 02:56:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:15.590 --> 02:56:15.600 align:start position:0%
thank you honorable kirk for taking my
 
02:56:17.590 --> 02:56:17.600 align:start position:0%
question and thank you mr chair i guess
 
02:56:19.269 --> 02:56:19.279 align:start position:0%
my question is around the discussion
 
02:56:21.830 --> 02:56:21.840 align:start position:0%
around 541a and rulemaking authority
 
02:56:24.870 --> 02:56:24.880 align:start position:0%
that's giving to agencies and and not
 
02:56:26.309 --> 02:56:26.319 align:start position:0%
just in this particular case but i guess
 
02:56:27.830 --> 02:56:27.840 align:start position:0%
in general to understand your philosophy
 
02:56:28.950 --> 02:56:28.960 align:start position:0%
and what you're thinking are you saying
 
02:56:30.550 --> 02:56:30.560 align:start position:0%
that whenever we give
 
02:56:32.389 --> 02:56:32.399 align:start position:0%
agencies rulemaking authorities say with
 
02:56:34.389 --> 02:56:34.399 align:start position:0%
the efa programs that that's
 
02:56:36.389 --> 02:56:36.399 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional and we have to be more
 
02:56:37.750 --> 02:56:37.760 align:start position:0%
detailed the more specific and
 
02:56:39.670 --> 02:56:39.680 align:start position:0%
everything we send to the to through the
 
02:56:39.680 --> 02:56:41.830 align:start position:0%
everything we send to the to through the
house

02:56:41.830 --> 02:56:41.840 align:start position:0%
house
 
02:56:42.710 --> 02:56:42.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
02:56:44.389 --> 02:56:44.399 align:start position:0%
representative lang
 
02:56:47.269 --> 02:56:47.279 align:start position:0%
i think the answer is yes
 
02:56:49.590 --> 02:56:49.600 align:start position:0%
the legislature frequently in my
 
02:56:52.630 --> 02:56:52.640 align:start position:0%
experience has set up programs and
 
02:56:54.630 --> 02:56:54.640 align:start position:0%
basically left it to the executive
 
02:56:57.110 --> 02:56:57.120 align:start position:0%
branch to really decide what the program
 
02:56:59.990 --> 02:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
is we we the legislature decides you
 
02:57:01.830 --> 02:57:01.840 align:start position:0%
know there's a problem and it'll cost
 
02:57:05.030 --> 02:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
250 000 to fix it but we'll let the
 
02:57:06.550 --> 02:57:06.560 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
02:57:08.790 --> 02:57:08.800 align:start position:0%
figure out the rules as to how to make
 
02:57:11.750 --> 02:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
that money fix the problem
 
02:57:13.830 --> 02:57:13.840 align:start position:0%
i think that is a failure on the part of
 
02:57:15.670 --> 02:57:15.680 align:start position:0%
the legislature and if it were
 
02:57:17.510 --> 02:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
challenged in court and it rarely is
 
02:57:19.510 --> 02:57:19.520 align:start position:0%
admittedly but if it were challenged in
 
02:57:22.630 --> 02:57:22.640 align:start position:0%
court those rules would fail for the
 
02:57:25.830 --> 02:57:25.840 align:start position:0%
legislature's failure to create the
 
02:57:28.230 --> 02:57:28.240 align:start position:0%
criteria for the program that enabled
 
02:57:30.150 --> 02:57:30.160 align:start position:0%
the rules to implement it
 
02:57:32.230 --> 02:57:32.240 align:start position:0%
and it's always debatable as to how far
 
02:57:34.070 --> 02:57:34.080 align:start position:0%
you have to go to do that
 
02:57:36.230 --> 02:57:36.240 align:start position:0%
but i think this is pretty clear that
 
02:57:38.389 --> 02:57:38.399 align:start position:0%
while you've established criteria the
 
02:57:40.550 --> 02:57:40.560 align:start position:0%
program could go in so many different
 
02:57:42.630 --> 02:57:42.640 align:start position:0%
directions based on the administrative
 
02:57:45.110 --> 02:57:45.120 align:start position:0%
discretion that the legislature if this
 
02:57:47.510 --> 02:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
bill were to become law has failed to go
 
02:57:49.429 --> 02:57:49.439 align:start position:0%
far enough to meet its constitutional
 
02:57:52.469 --> 02:57:52.479 align:start position:0%
responsibility to delegate authority to
 
02:57:54.790 --> 02:57:54.800 align:start position:0%
the executive branch
 
02:57:56.309 --> 02:57:56.319 align:start position:0%
thank you one follow-up question
 
02:57:56.319 --> 02:57:57.830 align:start position:0%
thank you one follow-up question
follow-up

02:57:57.830 --> 02:57:57.840 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
02:58:00.230 --> 02:58:00.240 align:start position:0%
so you don't think that the job car
 
02:58:00.240 --> 02:58:01.190 align:start position:0%
so you don't think that the job car
process

02:58:01.190 --> 02:58:01.200 align:start position:0%
process
 
02:58:02.870 --> 02:58:02.880 align:start position:0%
in using the administration reviewing
 
02:58:05.190 --> 02:58:05.200 align:start position:0%
and approving administrative rules as a
 
02:58:07.590 --> 02:58:07.600 align:start position:0%
legislative body both senate and house
 
02:58:10.309 --> 02:58:10.319 align:start position:0%
doesn't meet that criteria
 
02:58:12.870 --> 02:58:12.880 align:start position:0%
as i understand djelkar its purpose is
 
02:58:15.429 --> 02:58:15.439 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the intent of the
 
02:58:15.439 --> 02:58:16.870 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the intent of the
legislature

02:58:16.870 --> 02:58:16.880 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
02:58:19.510 --> 02:58:19.520 align:start position:0%
is implemented by the rules
 
02:58:22.070 --> 02:58:22.080 align:start position:0%
but where ion gel car were you on jail
 
02:58:23.349 --> 02:58:23.359 align:start position:0%
car i think you would have a very
 
02:58:25.710 --> 02:58:25.720 align:start position:0%
difficult time of saying what the
 
02:58:28.070 --> 02:58:28.080 align:start position:0%
legislat whether the rules met that
 
02:58:30.230 --> 02:58:30.240 align:start position:0%
criteria because the legislature hasn't
 
02:58:33.910 --> 02:58:33.920 align:start position:0%
set it out now gelcar could make its own
 
02:58:35.590 --> 02:58:35.600 align:start position:0%
decision and in effect become a mini
 
02:58:37.990 --> 02:58:38.000 align:start position:0%
legislature but my understanding is that
 
02:58:39.510 --> 02:58:39.520 align:start position:0%
wasn't the
 
02:58:42.070 --> 02:58:42.080 align:start position:0%
wasn't the basis for granting gelcar the
 
02:58:43.910 --> 02:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
review authority it has
 
02:58:47.269 --> 02:58:47.279 align:start position:0%
thank you and i do serve on gelcar
 
02:58:48.790 --> 02:58:48.800 align:start position:0%
and i'm sure you're aware of some of the
 
02:58:48.800 --> 02:58:50.469 align:start position:0%
and i'm sure you're aware of some of the
issues

02:58:50.469 --> 02:58:50.479 align:start position:0%
issues
 
02:58:52.150 --> 02:58:52.160 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
02:58:54.630 --> 02:58:54.640 align:start position:0%
not thank you uh
 
02:58:54.640 --> 02:58:55.830 align:start position:0%
not thank you uh
honorable

02:58:55.830 --> 02:58:55.840 align:start position:0%
honorable
 
02:58:57.590 --> 02:58:57.600 align:start position:0%
you know kirk
 
02:58:59.190 --> 02:58:59.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman it's a pleasure to
 
02:59:01.510 --> 02:59:01.520 align:start position:0%
be here and to see you folks someone
 
02:59:03.190 --> 02:59:03.200 align:start position:0%
said before that this bill probably
 
02:59:05.190 --> 02:59:05.200 align:start position:0%
should have gone to finance
 
02:59:05.200 --> 02:59:05.910 align:start position:0%
should have gone to finance
and

02:59:05.910 --> 02:59:05.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:59:08.389 --> 02:59:08.399 align:start position:0%
that probably is the case but right it's
 
02:59:12.950 --> 02:59:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:16.309 --> 02:59:16.319 align:start position:0%
yeah okay the last pink card
 
02:59:18.710 --> 02:59:18.720 align:start position:0%
is from david lackey
 
02:59:20.469 --> 02:59:20.479 align:start position:0%
uh from north
 
02:59:22.230 --> 02:59:22.240 align:start position:0%
haverhill fair
 
02:59:28.630 --> 02:59:28.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:30.630 --> 02:59:30.640 align:start position:0%
well thanks for having us here today and
 
02:59:32.309 --> 02:59:32.319 align:start position:0%
it's getting late so we're trying not to
 
02:59:34.950 --> 02:59:34.960 align:start position:0%
keep moving on here um
 
02:59:37.830 --> 02:59:37.840 align:start position:0%
i support this bill uh north havel fair
 
02:59:40.550 --> 02:59:40.560 align:start position:0%
um we same as everybody else we struggle
 
02:59:45.030 --> 02:59:45.040 align:start position:0%
with all the new rules and regulations
 
02:59:47.510 --> 02:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
probably for the last 10 12 years
 
02:59:48.950 --> 02:59:48.960 align:start position:0%
printing everything we've had to spend
 
02:59:50.710 --> 02:59:50.720 align:start position:0%
has been into electrical upgrades that
 
02:59:52.150 --> 02:59:52.160 align:start position:0%
are required
 
02:59:54.550 --> 02:59:54.560 align:start position:0%
and if you don't know electrical is huge
 
02:59:56.309 --> 02:59:56.319 align:start position:0%
dollars and you really don't get much
 
02:59:56.319 --> 02:59:59.190 align:start position:0%
dollars and you really don't get much
back

02:59:59.190 --> 02:59:59.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:00.389 --> 03:00:00.399 align:start position:0%
we're probably better than some
 
03:00:03.030 --> 03:00:03.040 align:start position:0%
fairgrounds as we moved to our location
 
03:00:05.990 --> 03:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
in 1980 and built some new buildings but
 
03:00:07.750 --> 03:00:07.760 align:start position:0%
as time goes on they're all in buildings
 
03:00:09.110 --> 03:00:09.120 align:start position:0%
and needing
 
03:00:11.590 --> 03:00:11.600 align:start position:0%
repairs upgrades
 
03:00:13.750 --> 03:00:13.760 align:start position:0%
same as hopping on our bleachers are not
 
03:00:15.190 --> 03:00:15.200 align:start position:0%
in good shape
 
03:00:17.429 --> 03:00:17.439 align:start position:0%
and every year when we get done the fare
 
03:00:19.670 --> 03:00:19.680 align:start position:0%
we're okay we did okay we broke even we
 
03:00:21.349 --> 03:00:21.359 align:start position:0%
might have made a little money
 
03:00:23.030 --> 03:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
um i think we're like a lot of other
 
03:00:25.429 --> 03:00:25.439 align:start position:0%
fears our off-season rentals
 
03:00:27.510 --> 03:00:27.520 align:start position:0%
is huge to us with we have a lot of
 
03:00:30.950 --> 03:00:30.960 align:start position:0%
wedding receptions in the building
 
03:00:33.830 --> 03:00:33.840 align:start position:0%
storage is is big but it still does not
 
03:00:35.590 --> 03:00:35.600 align:start position:0%
give us enough money
 
03:00:37.349 --> 03:00:37.359 align:start position:0%
to do our capital improvements that we
 
03:00:39.590 --> 03:00:39.600 align:start position:0%
need to do
 
03:00:41.670 --> 03:00:41.680 align:start position:0%
somebody made the comment
 
03:00:43.750 --> 03:00:43.760 align:start position:0%
why don't you guys do more
 
03:00:46.710 --> 03:00:46.720 align:start position:0%
fundraising type stuff on your own
 
03:00:48.389 --> 03:00:48.399 align:start position:0%
i'm here to say we're the fair that has
 
03:00:50.790 --> 03:00:50.800 align:start position:0%
the 300 volunteers
 
03:00:53.030 --> 03:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
and with what we do
 
03:00:55.030 --> 03:00:55.040 align:start position:0%
it just doesn't work to ask our people
 
03:00:57.030 --> 03:00:57.040 align:start position:0%
to do any more for free
 
03:01:03.110 --> 03:01:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:04.950 --> 03:01:04.960 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm probably old enough i've only
 
03:01:06.389 --> 03:01:06.399 align:start position:0%
heard the stories about what used to
 
03:01:08.150 --> 03:01:08.160 align:start position:0%
come when rockingham park was going and
 
03:01:11.110 --> 03:01:11.120 align:start position:0%
it was a huge asset to the fares and uh
 
03:01:12.710 --> 03:01:12.720 align:start position:0%
you know whatever we could get is going
 
03:01:14.710 --> 03:01:14.720 align:start position:0%
to be a huge asset now no matter how big
 
03:01:17.030 --> 03:01:17.040 align:start position:0%
or how small it is it just
 
03:01:18.870 --> 03:01:18.880 align:start position:0%
it's a struggle
 
03:01:21.510 --> 03:01:21.520 align:start position:0%
i our ferris by-laws are
 
03:01:23.269 --> 03:01:23.279 align:start position:0%
to support the 4-h
 
03:01:25.030 --> 03:01:25.040 align:start position:0%
luckily up in grafton county we still
 
03:01:26.870 --> 03:01:26.880 align:start position:0%
have a large 4-h
 
03:01:29.110 --> 03:01:29.120 align:start position:0%
group we have the kids come in
 
03:01:31.269 --> 03:01:31.279 align:start position:0%
and that's what drives me is to see
 
03:01:34.870 --> 03:01:34.880 align:start position:0%
these kids in there doing their projects
 
03:01:36.230 --> 03:01:36.240 align:start position:0%
what the adults get out of it for
 
03:01:38.550 --> 03:01:38.560 align:start position:0%
happiness is great but the kids is what
 
03:01:40.309 --> 03:01:40.319 align:start position:0%
drives drives me
 
03:01:40.319 --> 03:01:41.190 align:start position:0%
drives drives me
so

03:01:41.190 --> 03:01:41.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:01:44.389 --> 03:01:44.399 align:start position:0%
any support would be appreciated and
 
03:01:47.030 --> 03:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
i'll take any questions
 
03:01:48.790 --> 03:01:48.800 align:start position:0%

03:02:14.630 --> 03:02:14.640 align:start position:0%
what percentage of your
 
03:02:17.590 --> 03:02:17.600 align:start position:0%
income annually is from your
 
03:02:20.790 --> 03:02:20.800 align:start position:0%
off season rentals and 4-h participation
 
03:02:20.800 --> 03:02:21.830 align:start position:0%
off season rentals and 4-h participation
and

03:02:21.830 --> 03:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:02:25.190 --> 03:02:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:27.190 --> 03:02:27.200 align:start position:0%
i guess i really i don't have that info
 
03:02:30.389 --> 03:02:30.399 align:start position:0%
to answer um
 
03:02:33.269 --> 03:02:33.279 align:start position:0%
no i know i know it's a decent number
 
03:02:33.279 --> 03:02:36.389 align:start position:0%
no i know i know it's a decent number
um

03:02:36.389 --> 03:02:36.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:38.309 --> 03:02:38.319 align:start position:0%
i know our storage alone is like thirty
 
03:02:40.230 --> 03:02:40.240 align:start position:0%
to forty thousand dollars
 
03:02:42.469 --> 03:02:42.479 align:start position:0%
so as a percentage though what you don't
 
03:02:42.479 --> 03:02:43.269 align:start position:0%
so as a percentage though what you don't
know

03:02:43.269 --> 03:02:43.279 align:start position:0%
know
 
03:02:45.190 --> 03:02:45.200 align:start position:0%
okay thank you i'm the president not the
 
03:02:47.990 --> 03:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
treasurer okay
 
03:02:49.990 --> 03:02:50.000 align:start position:0%
representative romney uh this is a
 
03:02:51.910 --> 03:02:51.920 align:start position:0%
curiosity question now you mentioned you
 
03:02:53.670 --> 03:02:53.680 align:start position:0%
mentioned rockingham park and in its
 
03:02:56.150 --> 03:02:56.160 align:start position:0%
heyday it really did it was
 
03:02:58.630 --> 03:02:58.640 align:start position:0%
generated a lot of money for the state
 
03:02:58.640 --> 03:02:59.830 align:start position:0%
generated a lot of money for the state
so

03:02:59.830 --> 03:02:59.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:03:01.910 --> 03:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
was there an earmark when in those days
 
03:03:03.030 --> 03:03:03.040 align:start position:0%
that some of that money went from
 
03:03:05.269 --> 03:03:05.279 align:start position:0%
rockingham to the affairs or did you
 
03:03:06.790 --> 03:03:06.800 align:start position:0%
mention if you wrenching that i wasn't
 
03:03:08.389 --> 03:03:08.399 align:start position:0%
sure what you meant i believe i'm in the
 
03:03:10.469 --> 03:03:10.479 align:start position:0%
impression back in the day one quarter
 
03:03:13.190 --> 03:03:13.200 align:start position:0%
of one percent of their income or their
 
03:03:13.200 --> 03:03:14.630 align:start position:0%
of one percent of their income or their
take

03:03:14.630 --> 03:03:14.640 align:start position:0%
take
 
03:03:16.550 --> 03:03:16.560 align:start position:0%
went to the fairs okay so that's the
 
03:03:18.790 --> 03:03:18.800 align:start position:0%
source of yes
 
03:03:20.710 --> 03:03:20.720 align:start position:0%
and the commissioner is putting a thumbs
 
03:03:23.110 --> 03:03:23.120 align:start position:0%
up so you got it right thank you
 
03:03:24.550 --> 03:03:24.560 align:start position:0%
i just i was just at that time that was
 
03:03:26.870 --> 03:03:26.880 align:start position:0%
big money yeah i'm sure rocky and
 
03:03:28.550 --> 03:03:28.560 align:start position:0%
parkland and his day generated a lot of
 
03:03:30.630 --> 03:03:30.640 align:start position:0%
revenue so thank you representative
 
03:03:30.640 --> 03:03:32.790 align:start position:0%
revenue so thank you representative
tucker

03:03:32.790 --> 03:03:32.800 align:start position:0%
tucker
 
03:03:36.150 --> 03:03:36.160 align:start position:0%
so i'm thinking what would be comparable
 
03:03:36.160 --> 03:03:37.910 align:start position:0%
so i'm thinking what would be comparable
to

03:03:37.910 --> 03:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:03:40.230 --> 03:03:40.240 align:start position:0%
that kind of arrangement were we working
 
03:03:42.230 --> 03:03:42.240 align:start position:0%
with sports betting
 
03:03:44.870 --> 03:03:44.880 align:start position:0%
or casinos or
 
03:03:47.590 --> 03:03:47.600 align:start position:0%
in other words they had this minute
 
03:03:49.590 --> 03:03:49.600 align:start position:0%
amount of money from
 
03:03:52.950 --> 03:03:52.960 align:start position:0%
a betting situation is that correct yes
 
03:03:55.910 --> 03:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
that supported the fares
 
03:03:55.920 --> 03:03:56.790 align:start position:0%
that supported the fares
so

03:03:56.790 --> 03:03:56.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:03:58.469 --> 03:03:58.479 align:start position:0%
we're a big group here what is
 
03:04:00.790 --> 03:04:00.800 align:start position:0%
comparable now in the state
 
03:04:03.110 --> 03:04:03.120 align:start position:0%
to that that we could tag in as an
 
03:04:03.120 --> 03:04:05.190 align:start position:0%
to that that we could tag in as an
arrangement

03:04:05.190 --> 03:04:05.200 align:start position:0%
arrangement
 
03:04:07.030 --> 03:04:07.040 align:start position:0%
uh that i don't know i do know what i
 
03:04:09.510 --> 03:04:09.520 align:start position:0%
think we were setting on was if the
 
03:04:11.269 --> 03:04:11.279 align:start position:0%
state and new hampshire have had ever
 
03:04:13.349 --> 03:04:13.359 align:start position:0%
approved the casino
 
03:04:15.349 --> 03:04:15.359 align:start position:0%
that's where we were going to go
 
03:04:17.269 --> 03:04:17.279 align:start position:0%
to do the same thing to get a percentage
 
03:04:18.550 --> 03:04:18.560 align:start position:0%
of their take
 
03:04:20.230 --> 03:04:20.240 align:start position:0%
what's out there now i
 
03:04:21.670 --> 03:04:21.680 align:start position:0%
i really don't know
 
03:04:23.429 --> 03:04:23.439 align:start position:0%
so there are probably people on this
 
03:04:31.190 --> 03:04:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:33.030 --> 03:04:33.040 align:start position:0%
go ahead and answer the question and
 
03:04:34.870 --> 03:04:34.880 align:start position:0%
then yeah i mean the closest thing would
 
03:04:37.510 --> 03:04:37.520 align:start position:0%
be trying to somehow tap into charitable
 
03:04:37.520 --> 03:04:38.550 align:start position:0%
be trying to somehow tap into charitable
gaming

03:04:38.550 --> 03:04:38.560 align:start position:0%
gaming
 
03:04:39.830 --> 03:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
in a way that
 
03:04:41.990 --> 03:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
allows the
 
03:04:44.469 --> 03:04:44.479 align:start position:0%
affairs to participate in some fashion
 
03:04:46.550 --> 03:04:46.560 align:start position:0%
it's the the closest i could see how
 
03:04:49.110 --> 03:04:49.120 align:start position:0%
about the sports spreading online sport
 
03:04:50.710 --> 03:04:50.720 align:start position:0%
again that would be a different bill i
 
03:04:50.720 --> 03:04:52.630 align:start position:0%
again that would be a different bill i
mean

03:04:52.630 --> 03:04:52.640 align:start position:0%
mean
 
03:04:56.150 --> 03:04:56.160 align:start position:0%
it's a comparability in today's world
 
03:04:58.070 --> 03:04:58.080 align:start position:0%
yeah oh yeah i mean it used to be funded
 
03:05:00.469 --> 03:05:00.479 align:start position:0%
by rockingham park i mean it was racing
 
03:05:02.389 --> 03:05:02.399 align:start position:0%
so that's why charitable gaming with
 
03:05:03.830 --> 03:05:03.840 align:start position:0%
historic racing coming i know a lot of
 
03:05:05.269 --> 03:05:05.279 align:start position:0%
you didn't like that but
 
03:05:05.279 --> 03:05:06.150 align:start position:0%
you didn't like that but
um

03:05:06.150 --> 03:05:06.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:05:07.830 --> 03:05:07.840 align:start position:0%
with historic racing coming that would
 
03:05:09.269 --> 03:05:09.279 align:start position:0%
even be closer to it because it's
 
03:05:11.190 --> 03:05:11.200 align:start position:0%
equivalent to what it used to be
 
03:05:13.910 --> 03:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
so i'm very keen as a member someone
 
03:05:16.950 --> 03:05:16.960 align:start position:0%
from colus county
 
03:05:19.429 --> 03:05:19.439 align:start position:0%
who has enjoyed the lancaster fair
 
03:05:21.429 --> 03:05:21.439 align:start position:0%
most of my life
 
03:05:24.790 --> 03:05:24.800 align:start position:0%
and now uh from time to time take
 
03:05:27.750 --> 03:05:27.760 align:start position:0%
photographs for a magazine of a
 
03:05:30.150 --> 03:05:30.160 align:start position:0%
newspaper called country folks
 
03:05:32.469 --> 03:05:32.479 align:start position:0%
uh of fairs so i've been
 
03:05:32.479 --> 03:05:33.910 align:start position:0%
uh of fairs so i've been
around

03:05:33.910 --> 03:05:33.920 align:start position:0%
around
 
03:05:36.389 --> 03:05:36.399 align:start position:0%
to take photographs of fares there's
 
03:05:39.110 --> 03:05:39.120 align:start position:0%
just no question in my mind that
 
03:05:41.590 --> 03:05:41.600 align:start position:0%
the importance of our affairs to youth
 
03:05:44.230 --> 03:05:44.240 align:start position:0%
is very very high it's the highlight of
 
03:05:46.550 --> 03:05:46.560 align:start position:0%
their year of raising animals those who
 
03:05:47.990 --> 03:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
are into that
 
03:05:50.150 --> 03:05:50.160 align:start position:0%
and then those who do the more crafts
 
03:05:51.910 --> 03:05:51.920 align:start position:0%
and things i'm not quite as interested
 
03:05:51.920 --> 03:05:52.870 align:start position:0%
and things i'm not quite as interested
in

03:05:52.870 --> 03:05:52.880 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:05:56.150 --> 03:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a target of being prepared
 
03:05:57.510 --> 03:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
for something
 
03:05:59.750 --> 03:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
in lancaster at the lancaster fair
 
03:06:01.750 --> 03:06:01.760 align:start position:0%
there's a close relationship between the
 
03:06:03.590 --> 03:06:03.600 align:start position:0%
regional high school
 
03:06:06.469 --> 03:06:06.479 align:start position:0%
and its uh cte program
 
03:06:07.670 --> 03:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
and they
 
03:06:10.230 --> 03:06:10.240 align:start position:0%
operate and run
 
03:06:10.240 --> 03:06:11.670 align:start position:0%
operate and run
exhibits

03:06:11.670 --> 03:06:11.680 align:start position:0%
exhibits
 
03:06:13.349 --> 03:06:13.359 align:start position:0%
where they deal with the public with
 
03:06:15.990 --> 03:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
younger children they teach them about
 
03:06:16.000 --> 03:06:17.429 align:start position:0%
younger children they teach them about
agriculture

03:06:17.429 --> 03:06:17.439 align:start position:0%
agriculture
 
03:06:20.150 --> 03:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of maple sugaring and they
 
03:06:22.309 --> 03:06:22.319 align:start position:0%
have a sugaring program at the cte
 
03:06:22.319 --> 03:06:23.429 align:start position:0%
have a sugaring program at the cte
program

03:06:23.429 --> 03:06:23.439 align:start position:0%
program
 
03:06:25.349 --> 03:06:25.359 align:start position:0%
at white men's
 
03:06:26.870 --> 03:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
regional high school
 
03:06:29.190 --> 03:06:29.200 align:start position:0%
so there's a close relationship between
 
03:06:31.349 --> 03:06:31.359 align:start position:0%
education from the youngest
 
03:06:33.590 --> 03:06:33.600 align:start position:0%
in 4-h the little clover buds or
 
03:06:33.600 --> 03:06:34.630 align:start position:0%
in 4-h the little clover buds or
whatever

03:06:34.630 --> 03:06:34.640 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
03:06:40.230 --> 03:06:40.240 align:start position:0%
up to high school so i'm keen to find a
 
03:06:43.910 --> 03:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
revenue source but i on the other hand
 
03:06:46.950 --> 03:06:46.960 align:start position:0%
realize that representative kirk
 
03:06:49.269 --> 03:06:49.279 align:start position:0%
does know a lot about how things work
 
03:06:51.110 --> 03:06:51.120 align:start position:0%
and we need to find something else
 
03:06:53.030 --> 03:06:53.040 align:start position:0%
perhaps than the arrangement that's in
 
03:06:54.830 --> 03:06:54.840 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
03:06:58.630 --> 03:06:58.640 align:start position:0%
um i think it's a very worthwhile aim
 
03:07:00.230 --> 03:07:00.240 align:start position:0%
but we need to find something that
 
03:07:02.309 --> 03:07:02.319 align:start position:0%
actually will work and that's what you
 
03:07:04.469 --> 03:07:04.479 align:start position:0%
believe right what that's what you
 
03:07:04.479 --> 03:07:07.510 align:start position:0%
believe right what that's what you
believe

03:07:07.510 --> 03:07:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:09.670 --> 03:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
and and will produce the kind of money
 
03:07:11.990 --> 03:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
because we're talking about
 
03:07:13.590 --> 03:07:13.600 align:start position:0%
a lot of money
 
03:07:15.429 --> 03:07:15.439 align:start position:0%
and this is just a little bit that we're
 
03:07:17.110 --> 03:07:17.120 align:start position:0%
talking about but when you talk about
 
03:07:17.120 --> 03:07:18.950 align:start position:0%
talking about but when you talk about
electrical

03:07:18.950 --> 03:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
electrical
 
03:07:22.309 --> 03:07:22.319 align:start position:0%
uh work at fairgrounds it's a major
 
03:07:25.429 --> 03:07:25.439 align:start position:0%
problem first on the
 
03:07:28.870 --> 03:07:28.880 align:start position:0%
on the codes and then
 
03:07:28.880 --> 03:07:29.750 align:start position:0%
on the codes and then
on

03:07:29.750 --> 03:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:07:31.670 --> 03:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
energy saving
 
03:07:34.550 --> 03:07:34.560 align:start position:0%
so it's just a huge problem i can see
 
03:07:34.560 --> 03:07:35.269 align:start position:0%
so it's just a huge problem i can see
that

03:07:35.269 --> 03:07:35.279 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:07:35.279 --> 03:07:36.150 align:start position:0%
that
and

03:07:36.150 --> 03:07:36.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:07:40.790 --> 03:07:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:42.630 --> 03:07:42.640 align:start position:0%
find solutions
 
03:07:43.910 --> 03:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
that are
 
03:07:45.830 --> 03:07:45.840 align:start position:0%
perhaps more realistic than what has
 
03:07:52.070 --> 03:07:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:55.590 --> 03:07:55.600 align:start position:0%
okay um i think the commissioner
 
03:07:57.910 --> 03:07:57.920 align:start position:0%
jasper wanted to say something
 
03:07:59.030 --> 03:07:59.040 align:start position:0%
with me
 
03:08:00.710 --> 03:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
i think there's another question for you
 
03:08:03.510 --> 03:08:03.520 align:start position:0%
but i i just wanted to to make it clear
 
03:08:06.710 --> 03:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
that what happened when the paramutual
 
03:08:08.309 --> 03:08:08.319 align:start position:0%
went to support the fairs it wasn't
 
03:08:10.150 --> 03:08:10.160 align:start position:0%
because everybody thought or even
 
03:08:12.230 --> 03:08:12.240 align:start position:0%
rockingham park thought this was the
 
03:08:13.750 --> 03:08:13.760 align:start position:0%
right thing to do it was actually a
 
03:08:16.230 --> 03:08:16.240 align:start position:0%
hostage situation
 
03:08:18.710 --> 03:08:18.720 align:start position:0%
so rockingham park which wished to
 
03:08:21.030 --> 03:08:21.040 align:start position:0%
expand to night racing they needed
 
03:08:23.429 --> 03:08:23.439 align:start position:0%
legislative approval to do that it came
 
03:08:25.190 --> 03:08:25.200 align:start position:0%
down to a situation
 
03:08:25.200 --> 03:08:26.070 align:start position:0%
down to a situation
where

03:08:26.070 --> 03:08:26.080 align:start position:0%
where
 
03:08:29.590 --> 03:08:29.600 align:start position:0%
um one senator was the person who
 
03:08:31.830 --> 03:08:31.840 align:start position:0%
in 24-24 it seems like there must have
 
03:08:35.750 --> 03:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
been somebody else involved i guess
 
03:08:37.670 --> 03:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
that's not the important part it's the
 
03:08:39.030 --> 03:08:39.040 align:start position:0%
important part is
 
03:08:41.030 --> 03:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
that he said the only way i'm going to
 
03:08:42.630 --> 03:08:42.640 align:start position:0%
allow this to happen
 
03:08:45.830 --> 03:08:45.840 align:start position:0%
is if there is support for the fairs
 
03:08:48.309 --> 03:08:48.319 align:start position:0%
and since rockingham park was there on
 
03:08:49.510 --> 03:08:49.520 align:start position:0%
the table
 
03:08:51.750 --> 03:08:51.760 align:start position:0%
he grabbed that quarter of a percent so
 
03:08:52.950 --> 03:08:52.960 align:start position:0%
it really
 
03:08:54.630 --> 03:08:54.640 align:start position:0%
that's how that came about it didn't
 
03:08:55.990 --> 03:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
have anything
 
03:08:57.750 --> 03:08:57.760 align:start position:0%
to do with oh everybody thinks this is
 
03:09:00.309 --> 03:09:00.319 align:start position:0%
the way to fund the fairs it just was
 
03:09:03.910 --> 03:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
that convenient hostage to take and so
 
03:09:07.910 --> 03:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:10.150 --> 03:09:10.160 align:start position:0%
questions for mr
 
03:09:10.160 --> 03:09:11.830 align:start position:0%
questions for mr
blacky

03:09:11.830 --> 03:09:11.840 align:start position:0%
blacky
 
03:09:13.830 --> 03:09:13.840 align:start position:0%
represent schamberg
 
03:09:15.830 --> 03:09:15.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
03:09:17.510 --> 03:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
taking this
 
03:09:19.510 --> 03:09:19.520 align:start position:0%
would you believe
 
03:09:21.590 --> 03:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
that i think it would behoove this
 
03:09:25.590 --> 03:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
committee to move this to interim study
 
03:09:27.030 --> 03:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
for this bill
 
03:09:30.870 --> 03:09:30.880 align:start position:0%
to make it work because our future
 
03:09:33.110 --> 03:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
depends upon
 
03:09:35.269 --> 03:09:35.279 align:start position:0%
the farmers and the people that grow and
 
03:09:37.510 --> 03:09:37.520 align:start position:0%
produce our food would you believe that
 
03:09:37.520 --> 03:09:38.950 align:start position:0%
produce our food would you believe that
yep

03:09:38.950 --> 03:09:38.960 align:start position:0%
yep
 
03:09:41.990 --> 03:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
i like your short answer
 
03:09:44.950 --> 03:09:44.960 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
03:09:46.469 --> 03:09:46.479 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time thank you i'm
 
03:09:50.389 --> 03:09:50.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:53.590 --> 03:09:53.600 align:start position:0%
right if anybody else have anything
 
03:09:55.750 --> 03:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
that they want to say for or against
 
03:09:58.229 --> 03:09:58.239 align:start position:0%
house bill 1584
 
03:09:59.910 --> 03:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
if not then i'm closing the public
 
03:10:03.030 --> 03:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
hearing on house bill 1584. thank you
 
03:10:03.040 --> 03:10:03.910 align:start position:0%
hearing on house bill 1584. thank you
for

03:10:03.910 --> 03:10:03.920 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:10:07.750 --> 03:10:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:07.760 --> 03:10:09.670 align:start position:0%
 
representative

03:10:09.670 --> 03:10:09.680 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:10:12.790 --> 03:10:12.800 align:start position:0%
so uh for everybody mr chair
 
03:10:14.710 --> 03:10:14.720 align:start position:0%
the way i look at the calendar we have
 
03:10:17.269 --> 03:10:17.279 align:start position:0%
two weeks left
 
03:10:20.950 --> 03:10:20.960 align:start position:0%
next week we have three session days
 
03:10:22.550 --> 03:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
but the big bill before us is the
 
03:10:25.830 --> 03:10:25.840 align:start position:0%
marijuana bill the cannabis bill
 
03:10:28.070 --> 03:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
and if if we don't
 
03:10:29.349 --> 03:10:29.359 align:start position:0%
we i guess the question is are we
 
03:10:31.830 --> 03:10:31.840 align:start position:0%
planning on a monday or a friday to do
 
03:10:34.309 --> 03:10:34.319 align:start position:0%
something on the marijuana bill
 
03:10:36.309 --> 03:10:36.319 align:start position:0%
or we're going to leave it all to the
 
03:10:38.710 --> 03:10:38.720 align:start position:0%
last week because of the calendar
 
03:10:40.630 --> 03:10:40.640 align:start position:0%
we have to have this thing voted out
 
03:10:43.110 --> 03:10:43.120 align:start position:0%
that last week
 
03:10:44.309 --> 03:10:44.319 align:start position:0%
and i think it's going to take more than
 
03:10:46.870 --> 03:10:46.880 align:start position:0%
one day to my time schedule to figure
 
03:10:49.429 --> 03:10:49.439 align:start position:0%
out the rest of the calendar
 
03:10:52.070 --> 03:10:52.080 align:start position:0%
and work around the
 
03:10:52.080 --> 03:10:54.070 align:start position:0%
and work around the
sessions

03:10:54.070 --> 03:10:54.080 align:start position:0%
sessions
 
03:10:56.150 --> 03:10:56.160 align:start position:0%
is within the next hour i've got to make
 
03:10:59.750 --> 03:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:59.760 --> 03:11:00.790 align:start position:0%
 
yes

03:11:00.790 --> 03:11:00.800 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:11:03.190 --> 03:11:03.200 align:start position:0%
so i i will say there's a group of uh
 
03:11:05.349 --> 03:11:05.359 align:start position:0%
legislators that are trying to work out
 
03:11:07.830 --> 03:11:07.840 align:start position:0%
what we can fix in the in that um
 
03:11:09.830 --> 03:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
marijuana bill to make it work
 
03:11:11.510 --> 03:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
um and i'm happy to take anybody who
 
03:11:13.349 --> 03:11:13.359 align:start position:0%
wants to come and join us i know a
 
03:11:14.630 --> 03:11:14.640 align:start position:0%
couple of us are going to lunch today to
 
03:11:16.550 --> 03:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
have a discussion about it and i also
 
03:11:17.910 --> 03:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
have already asked the governor for an
 
03:11:19.910 --> 03:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
appointment to chat with him about any
 
03:11:21.510 --> 03:11:21.520 align:start position:0%
proposed amendments we have to see how
 
03:11:23.429 --> 03:11:23.439 align:start position:0%
that's going to work with his office to
 
03:11:25.429 --> 03:11:25.439 align:start position:0%
make sure that we don't uh poison pill
 
03:11:28.150 --> 03:11:28.160 align:start position:0%
the bill um if he's in favor in favor of
 
03:11:30.469 --> 03:11:30.479 align:start position:0%
it so um i'd ask for a little bit of
 
03:11:32.309 --> 03:11:32.319 align:start position:0%
time so we can work together we've had a
 
03:11:33.830 --> 03:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
couple industry experts we've had
 
03:11:36.710 --> 03:11:36.720 align:start position:0%
conversations with um but and and we'd
 
03:11:37.910 --> 03:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
like to see a bill that we could move
 
03:11:39.429 --> 03:11:39.439 align:start position:0%
forward with i just had a conversation
 
03:11:41.510 --> 03:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
with finance about their asks and all
 
03:11:43.110 --> 03:11:43.120 align:start position:0%
the asks in the bill
 
03:11:45.269 --> 03:11:45.279 align:start position:0%
so just if i could have some time to try
 
03:11:46.950 --> 03:11:46.960 align:start position:0%
to put together a laundry list of
 
03:11:49.030 --> 03:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
changes to the bill that that might make
 
03:11:50.950 --> 03:11:50.960 align:start position:0%
it more palatable to people to be able
 
03:11:52.870 --> 03:11:52.880 align:start position:0%
to go through it
 
03:11:57.110 --> 03:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:59.190 --> 03:11:59.200 align:start position:0%
thank you i think
 
03:12:01.190 --> 03:12:01.200 align:start position:0%
we've got a big problem with this in
 
03:12:01.200 --> 03:12:02.150 align:start position:0%
we've got a big problem with this in
that

03:12:02.150 --> 03:12:02.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:12:05.349 --> 03:12:05.359 align:start position:0%
on the sponsor's view of how much
 
03:12:07.190 --> 03:12:07.200 align:start position:0%
revenue there is
 
03:12:10.229 --> 03:12:10.239 align:start position:0%
is extremely different from
 
03:12:12.550 --> 03:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
anything that we've been given from
 
03:12:14.309 --> 03:12:14.319 align:start position:0%
anywhere else
 
03:12:17.590 --> 03:12:17.600 align:start position:0%
and that they've put policy in there
 
03:12:19.910 --> 03:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
that spends all that revenue that he
 
03:12:22.309 --> 03:12:22.319 align:start position:0%
thinks is coming in
 
03:12:23.990 --> 03:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
and we're not supposed to deal with
 
03:12:24.000 --> 03:12:26.790 align:start position:0%
and we're not supposed to deal with
policy

03:12:26.790 --> 03:12:26.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:26.800 --> 03:12:27.750 align:start position:0%
 
on

03:12:27.750 --> 03:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:12:31.190 --> 03:12:31.200 align:start position:0%
we're trying to get some other ways of
 
03:12:33.349 --> 03:12:33.359 align:start position:0%
figuring out
 
03:12:34.870 --> 03:12:34.880 align:start position:0%
the revenue
 
03:12:39.510 --> 03:12:39.520 align:start position:0%
to have a few more triangulations there
 
03:12:41.830 --> 03:12:41.840 align:start position:0%
but it looks like it's around
 
03:12:44.870 --> 03:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
40 to 50 million at the most and with
 
03:12:48.790 --> 03:12:48.800 align:start position:0%
the edibles cut out of it less
 
03:12:48.800 --> 03:12:49.670 align:start position:0%
the edibles cut out of it less
so

03:12:49.670 --> 03:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:12:51.190 --> 03:12:51.200 align:start position:0%
again i i think that was if you talk
 
03:12:53.190 --> 03:12:53.200 align:start position:0%
about the net revenue to the state yes
 
03:12:54.790 --> 03:12:54.800 align:start position:0%
uh that was the number we were working
 
03:12:56.870 --> 03:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
basing our our amendments and our
 
03:12:59.269 --> 03:12:59.279 align:start position:0%
conversations around was i think i don't
 
03:13:00.710 --> 03:13:00.720 align:start position:0%
remember be honest with who presented
 
03:13:02.870 --> 03:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
this the sheet to us that had that
 
03:13:05.269 --> 03:13:05.279 align:start position:0%
number was 49 million based on uh
 
03:13:06.630 --> 03:13:06.640 align:start position:0%
revenue to the state is what they were
 
03:13:08.309 --> 03:13:08.319 align:start position:0%
estimating and i'm using that as kind of
 
03:13:10.150 --> 03:13:10.160 align:start position:0%
a basis to
 
03:13:12.389 --> 03:13:12.399 align:start position:0%
establish policy around that was the
 
03:13:13.990 --> 03:13:14.000 align:start position:0%
liquor commission yeah that's what i
 
03:13:15.349 --> 03:13:15.359 align:start position:0%
thought it was so i'm using the liquor
 
03:13:17.110 --> 03:13:17.120 align:start position:0%
commission's number not anybody else's
 
03:13:19.190 --> 03:13:19.200 align:start position:0%
number because i feel that it included
 
03:13:19.200 --> 03:13:20.309 align:start position:0%
number because i feel that it included
edibles

03:13:20.309 --> 03:13:20.319 align:start position:0%
edibles
 
03:13:22.469 --> 03:13:22.479 align:start position:0%
it included portion of edibles yes
 
03:13:24.950 --> 03:13:24.960 align:start position:0%
well a very small portion
 
03:13:27.110 --> 03:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
so anyway i just asked for some time to
 
03:13:28.710 --> 03:13:28.720 align:start position:0%
you know don't schedule this for monday
 
03:13:31.510 --> 03:13:31.520 align:start position:0%
you know give us some time to to meet
 
03:13:33.590 --> 03:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
and try to develop an amendment and i'm
 
03:13:35.110 --> 03:13:35.120 align:start position:0%
happy to work with anybody from either
 
03:13:37.190 --> 03:13:37.200 align:start position:0%
either side of the aisle to try to get
 
03:13:38.790 --> 03:13:38.800 align:start position:0%
you know something that a majority of
 
03:13:41.510 --> 03:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
the committee can support
 
03:13:42.790 --> 03:13:42.800 align:start position:0%
but can
 
03:13:45.030 --> 03:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
can the chair think about
 
03:13:45.040 --> 03:13:46.469 align:start position:0%
can the chair think about
this

03:13:46.469 --> 03:13:46.479 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:13:48.790 --> 03:13:48.800 align:start position:0%
conundrum we've got of not supposed to
 
03:13:54.150 --> 03:13:54.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:57.110 --> 03:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
that's going to be tough
 
03:13:58.550 --> 03:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:13:58.560 --> 03:13:59.910 align:start position:0%
thank you
well

03:13:59.910 --> 03:13:59.920 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:14:02.309 --> 03:14:02.319 align:start position:0%
i i get well i guess you could say that
 
03:14:04.229 --> 03:14:04.239 align:start position:0%
i guess changing the policy would be
 
03:14:08.389 --> 03:14:08.399 align:start position:0%
making edibles in the build completely
 
03:14:10.309 --> 03:14:10.319 align:start position:0%
or we could say it's a revenue thing
 
03:14:11.750 --> 03:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
because we're adding more revenue by
 
03:14:12.870 --> 03:14:12.880 align:start position:0%
doing so
 
03:14:15.190 --> 03:14:15.200 align:start position:0%
so i don't know that's it i will skirt
 
03:14:17.750 --> 03:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
that line as close as i can i promise mr
 
03:14:19.429 --> 03:14:19.439 align:start position:0%
vice chairman
 
03:14:21.590 --> 03:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
because the revenue
 
03:14:23.830 --> 03:14:23.840 align:start position:0%
is going to be changed dramatically if
 
03:14:25.030 --> 03:14:25.040 align:start position:0%
you can do
 
03:14:26.630 --> 03:14:26.640 align:start position:0%
the animals
 
03:14:29.510 --> 03:14:29.520 align:start position:0%
again not the edibles as as
 
03:14:31.990 --> 03:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
bill says now because that's just the
 
03:14:32.000 --> 03:14:33.429 align:start position:0%
bill says now because that's just the
condition

03:14:33.429 --> 03:14:33.439 align:start position:0%
condition
 
03:14:35.190 --> 03:14:35.200 align:start position:0%
again i i understand mr chair we're
 
03:14:36.950 --> 03:14:36.960 align:start position:0%
going to try and not change
 
03:14:38.309 --> 03:14:38.319 align:start position:0%
a significant portion of the policy
 
03:14:39.670 --> 03:14:39.680 align:start position:0%
there is some that will be some minor
 
03:14:41.110 --> 03:14:41.120 align:start position:0%
change but again it's around revenue
 
03:14:42.389 --> 03:14:42.399 align:start position:0%
that we're having the conversation and
 
03:14:44.790 --> 03:14:44.800 align:start position:0%
the changes in policy so i'm not sure
 
03:14:46.389 --> 03:14:46.399 align:start position:0%
that'll change the underlying
 
03:14:48.150 --> 03:14:48.160 align:start position:0%
legalization aspect of the bill it
 
03:14:51.349 --> 03:14:51.359 align:start position:0%
doesn't say anything about the regular
 
03:14:51.359 --> 03:14:54.150 align:start position:0%
doesn't say anything about the regular
edibles

03:14:54.150 --> 03:14:54.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:55.670 --> 03:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
you could
 
03:14:57.830 --> 03:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
there is a segment about
 
03:14:59.830 --> 03:14:59.840 align:start position:0%
edibles in the bill i can't even say the
 
03:15:02.229 --> 03:15:02.239 align:start position:0%
word i don't even use this stuff but um
 
03:15:03.830 --> 03:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
again uh
 
03:15:05.190 --> 03:15:05.200 align:start position:0%
there is some language in the bill
 
03:15:06.710 --> 03:15:06.720 align:start position:0%
already about edibles and allowing
 
03:15:08.710 --> 03:15:08.720 align:start position:0%
edibles in the retail locations for the
 
03:15:10.150 --> 03:15:10.160 align:start position:0%
state and
 
03:15:11.830 --> 03:15:11.840 align:start position:0%
it's just about how we deal with some of
 
03:15:13.830 --> 03:15:13.840 align:start position:0%
that and what that looks like so again
 
03:15:16.229 --> 03:15:16.239 align:start position:0%
it's already in the bill um we're just
 
03:15:18.950 --> 03:15:18.960 align:start position:0%
trying to skirt and clean up some
 
03:15:21.429 --> 03:15:21.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:23.910 --> 03:15:23.920 align:start position:0%
regular animals right and again one of
 
03:15:25.110 --> 03:15:25.120 align:start position:0%
the like one of the big we're taking
 
03:15:26.630 --> 03:15:26.640 align:start position:0%
some of the easy swings at stuff like
 
03:15:27.830 --> 03:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
one of the conversation points was
 
03:15:29.510 --> 03:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
around banking right it was clear that
 
03:15:31.030 --> 03:15:31.040 align:start position:0%
the banking language just seemed like to
 
03:15:33.190 --> 03:15:33.200 align:start position:0%
everybody was unworkable right so that
 
03:15:34.469 --> 03:15:34.479 align:start position:0%
was like one of the first amendments i
 
03:15:36.070 --> 03:15:36.080 align:start position:0%
wrote down strike all the banking
 
03:15:38.229 --> 03:15:38.239 align:start position:0%
language right so that's a simple change
 
03:15:40.229 --> 03:15:40.239 align:start position:0%
that that you know creating a state bank
 
03:15:41.750 --> 03:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
isn't reasonable we heard that banking
 
03:15:43.349 --> 03:15:43.359 align:start position:0%
is available these agencies so it's not
 
03:15:45.349 --> 03:15:45.359 align:start position:0%
needed in the bill clean language that
 
03:15:47.110 --> 03:15:47.120 align:start position:0%
would help again bring some people into
 
03:15:48.550 --> 03:15:48.560 align:start position:0%
the mix and into the fold that might
 
03:15:49.830 --> 03:15:49.840 align:start position:0%
have objected to the bill for that
 
03:15:52.070 --> 03:15:52.080 align:start position:0%
reason um there was a conversation
 
03:15:53.190 --> 03:15:53.200 align:start position:0%
around the
 
03:15:53.200 --> 03:15:54.389 align:start position:0%
around the
the

03:15:54.389 --> 03:15:54.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:15:56.309 --> 03:15:56.319 align:start position:0%
the funding and how the funding is split
 
03:15:58.550 --> 03:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
up and cleaning up that language to make
 
03:15:59.990 --> 03:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
it again a little more palatable to
 
03:16:01.830 --> 03:16:01.840 align:start position:0%
people because as i read that bill i had
 
03:16:03.910 --> 03:16:03.920 align:start position:0%
to go to daryl representative abbas
 
03:16:05.830 --> 03:16:05.840 align:start position:0%
three times to try to understand what he
 
03:16:07.670 --> 03:16:07.680 align:start position:0%
was trying to do because of the way that
 
03:16:09.269 --> 03:16:09.279 align:start position:0%
bill was worded and we were trying to
 
03:16:11.670 --> 03:16:11.680 align:start position:0%
clean up some of that language as well
 
03:16:14.229 --> 03:16:14.239 align:start position:0%
um and then it was the we had the simple
 
03:16:17.429 --> 03:16:17.439 align:start position:0%
error that was market consultants versus
 
03:16:19.269 --> 03:16:19.279 align:start position:0%
investigators that was a mistake in the
 
03:16:21.349 --> 03:16:21.359 align:start position:0%
bill i have a language to clean that
 
03:16:22.630 --> 03:16:22.640 align:start position:0%
portion of the amendment to clean that
 
03:16:25.349 --> 03:16:25.359 align:start position:0%
up um but and again we're we're meeting
 
03:16:27.030 --> 03:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
the ideas around the biggest
 
03:16:29.510 --> 03:16:29.520 align:start position:0%
conversation point is around cultivation
 
03:16:32.150 --> 03:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
and whether or not we'll allow the atc
 
03:16:33.910 --> 03:16:33.920 align:start position:0%
cultivators to be able to sell to the
 
03:16:35.910 --> 03:16:35.920 align:start position:0%
state and what that implications that
 
03:16:37.750 --> 03:16:37.760 align:start position:0%
are because under the current
 
03:16:37.760 --> 03:16:38.710 align:start position:0%
are because under the current
bill

03:16:38.710 --> 03:16:38.720 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:16:40.790 --> 03:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
under the current law the cultivators
 
03:16:42.950 --> 03:16:42.960 align:start position:0%
can't sell to the state and so we'd have
 
03:16:45.190 --> 03:16:45.200 align:start position:0%
to play with that language to allow
 
03:16:47.349 --> 03:16:47.359 align:start position:0%
those atc cultivators to be able to sell
 
03:16:49.349 --> 03:16:49.359 align:start position:0%
to the state to create a market that's
 
03:16:50.870 --> 03:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
already readily available for the state
 
03:16:53.030 --> 03:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
to kick off from day one
 
03:16:54.469 --> 03:16:54.479 align:start position:0%
so those are just some of the ideas that
 
03:16:56.070 --> 03:16:56.080 align:start position:0%
are floating around trying to deal with
 
03:16:58.309 --> 03:16:58.319 align:start position:0%
okay we have to report the bill out on
 
03:17:00.229 --> 03:17:00.239 align:start position:0%
the 24th
 
03:17:02.630 --> 03:17:02.640 align:start position:0%
today is the ninth
 
03:17:07.510 --> 03:17:07.520 align:start position:0%
the 24th is two weeks from tomorrow
 
03:17:08.790 --> 03:17:08.800 align:start position:0%
next week
 
03:17:10.790 --> 03:17:10.800 align:start position:0%
is blown apart
 
03:17:15.269 --> 03:17:15.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:16.630 --> 03:17:16.640 align:start position:0%
so we have
 
03:17:19.429 --> 03:17:19.439 align:start position:0%
friday the 18th
 
03:17:21.349 --> 03:17:21.359 align:start position:0%
and then
 
03:17:25.429 --> 03:17:25.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:27.910 --> 03:17:27.920 align:start position:0%
and possibly
 
03:17:27.920 --> 03:17:31.030 align:start position:0%
and possibly
thursday

03:17:31.030 --> 03:17:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:31.040 --> 03:17:33.110 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:17:33.110 --> 03:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:17:34.950 --> 03:17:34.960 align:start position:0%
so mr j if you give me until wednesday
 
03:17:34.960 --> 03:17:35.990 align:start position:0%
so mr j if you give me until wednesday
of

03:17:35.990 --> 03:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:17:37.590 --> 03:17:37.600 align:start position:0%
next week i'll give you some dates that
 
03:17:39.030 --> 03:17:39.040 align:start position:0%
might work and we'll have amendments we
 
03:17:41.190 --> 03:17:41.200 align:start position:0%
can do a work session if you want
 
03:17:42.389 --> 03:17:42.399 align:start position:0%
but i think we should still have a work
 
03:17:44.389 --> 03:17:44.399 align:start position:0%
session on the 18th whether you're right
 
03:17:45.750 --> 03:17:45.760 align:start position:0%
now yeah
 
03:17:47.429 --> 03:17:47.439 align:start position:0%
we're going to have a meeting
 
03:17:47.439 --> 03:17:48.630 align:start position:0%
we're going to have a meeting
okay

03:17:48.630 --> 03:17:48.640 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:17:50.150 --> 03:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
i'll have something ready by then to
 
03:17:52.830 --> 03:17:52.840 align:start position:0%
have a discussion but i need to
 
03:17:56.070 --> 03:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
schedule something on
 
03:17:57.750 --> 03:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
by the 16th
 
03:18:01.510 --> 03:18:01.520 align:start position:0%
at 2 o'clock for the following
 
03:18:03.510 --> 03:18:03.520 align:start position:0%
if i don't schedule it so i'd put a
 
03:18:05.190 --> 03:18:05.200 align:start position:0%
placeholder in pick a date pick a time
 
03:18:06.950 --> 03:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
we'll show up and if it's not needed
 
03:18:08.550 --> 03:18:08.560 align:start position:0%
we'll if we finish it all on the 18th we
 
03:18:09.910 --> 03:18:09.920 align:start position:0%
can just cancel it i don't think we're
 
03:18:11.510 --> 03:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
going to finish it all in the 18th but
 
03:18:16.790 --> 03:18:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:19.750 --> 03:18:19.760 align:start position:0%
that would be great and i suggest i i
 
03:18:21.670 --> 03:18:21.680 align:start position:0%
suggest i suppose i've spoken to the
 
03:18:24.229 --> 03:18:24.239 align:start position:0%
governor about this twice
 
03:18:25.910 --> 03:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
and he's adamant
 
03:18:27.830 --> 03:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
he doesn't want edibles in the bill
 
03:18:29.670 --> 03:18:29.680 align:start position:0%
now he does not he doesn't want edible
 
03:18:31.510 --> 03:18:31.520 align:start position:0%
stuff that's why it's such a convoluted
 
03:18:33.750 --> 03:18:33.760 align:start position:0%
bill the way they wrote it
 
03:18:33.760 --> 03:18:35.349 align:start position:0%
bill the way they wrote it
so

03:18:35.349 --> 03:18:35.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:18:37.750 --> 03:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
in terms of the intervals so you talk to
 
03:18:39.670 --> 03:18:39.680 align:start position:0%
the governor if he says he's changed his
 
03:18:39.680 --> 03:18:41.110 align:start position:0%
the governor if he says he's changed his
mind

03:18:41.110 --> 03:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
mind
 
03:18:42.950 --> 03:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
if you want to save a lot of work but
 
03:18:44.710 --> 03:18:44.720 align:start position:0%
he's assuming there's no that there's no
 
03:18:46.229 --> 03:18:46.239 align:start position:0%
edibles in the bill
 
03:18:47.830 --> 03:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
again that's my reason for meeting with
 
03:19:01.349 --> 03:19:01.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:02.870 --> 03:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
do you want to create a subcommittee and
 
03:19:04.790 --> 03:19:04.800 align:start position:0%
just we can work through that or do you
 
03:19:10.670 --> 03:19:10.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:22.389 --> 03:19:22.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:25.030 --> 03:19:25.040 align:start position:0%
but we are having a session on tuesday
 
03:19:27.429 --> 03:19:27.439 align:start position:0%
because i haven't heard that oh yeah i
 
03:19:29.990 --> 03:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
mean i've i've been told second hand but
 
03:19:31.670 --> 03:19:31.680 align:start position:0%
no no it's in the calendar it's in the
 
03:19:35.110 --> 03:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
calendar wednesday wednesday thursday
 
03:19:37.190 --> 03:19:37.200 align:start position:0%
that came out a week or so ago
 
03:19:39.110 --> 03:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
yeah that's kind of screws us up i think
 
03:19:42.790 --> 03:19:42.800 align:start position:0%
i read a week to last week's morning
 
03:19:42.800 --> 03:19:44.229 align:start position:0%
i read a week to last week's morning
susan

03:19:59.670 --> 03:19:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:02.550 --> 03:20:02.560 align:start position:0%
that really makes it impossible to do
 
03:20:04.469 --> 03:20:04.479 align:start position:0%

mr chairman
 
03:20:23.429 --> 03:20:23.439 align:start position:0%
yes i really do think that subcommittee
 
03:20:25.750 --> 03:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
ought to be an official subcommittee i
 
03:20:27.670 --> 03:20:27.680 align:start position:0%
think on this topic
 
03:20:30.550 --> 03:20:30.560 align:start position:0%
transparency is very important i don't
 
03:20:31.990 --> 03:20:32.000 align:start position:0%
think it will change anything that
 
03:20:34.150 --> 03:20:34.160 align:start position:0%
happens but i really think it should be
 
03:20:36.469 --> 03:20:36.479 align:start position:0%
an official subcommittee of ways and
 
03:20:36.479 --> 03:20:50.950 align:start position:0%
an official subcommittee of ways and
means

03:20:50.950 --> 03:20:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:54.870 --> 03:20:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:56.389 --> 03:20:56.399 align:start position:0%
who are the members
 
03:21:02.870 --> 03:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:04.229 --> 03:21:04.239 align:start position:0%
and whoever they want
 
03:21:05.349 --> 03:21:05.359 align:start position:0%
because the problem is we can't get it
 
03:21:48.070 --> 03:21:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:48.080 --> 03:21:50.160 align:start position:0%
