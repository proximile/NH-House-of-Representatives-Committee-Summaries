so let's uh here so here here here's the
 
00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 align:start position:0%
game plan uh we're probably going to
 
00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 align:start position:0%
meet two more time uh one more time
 
00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 align:start position:0%
after this um so anything we don't like
 
00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 align:start position:0%
finish finish today uh we've got a
 
00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.080 align:start position:0%
non-gain Amendment um which I did
 
00:03:42.429 --> 00:03:42.439 align:start position:0%
schedule for next week and then I was
 
00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
kindly instructed to not schedule things
 
00:03:45.869 --> 00:03:45.879 align:start position:0%
during school vacation week uh so we're
 
00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 align:start position:0%
going to go the week after um there's
 
00:03:50.429 --> 00:03:50.439 align:start position:0%
going to be a non Amendment from
 
00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 align:start position:0%
representative walner uh we have to so
 
00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 align:start position:0%
non we have to do a hearing um so what
 
00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 align:start position:0%
we'll do is we'll do the hearing and
 
00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 align:start position:0%
exec on the same day for that bill so we
 
00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 align:start position:0%
have to meet one more time uh regard L
 
00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 align:start position:0%
um so anything that we don't come to
 
00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:04.239 align:start position:0%
consensus today we'll do in two weeks
 
00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 align:start position:0%
and that will probably be the finality
 
00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 align:start position:0%
of uh our work um assuming we don't get
 
00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:12.799 align:start position:0%
anything from the Senate um we might
 
00:04:15.869 --> 00:04:15.879 align:start position:0%
which we might very well do so um that's
 
00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 align:start position:0%
kind of the game plan so today I'm
 
00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:20.479 align:start position:0%
thinking will'll be very short
 
00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 align:start position:0%
um and if I can bring up my schedule
 
00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 align:start position:0%
here um because I want to start with the
 
00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.350 align:start position:0%
here um because I want to start with the
um

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 align:start position:0%
here we
 
00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 align:start position:0%
go I want to start with the ratios
 
00:04:38.749 --> 00:04:38.759 align:start position:0%
because representative walner has
 
00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.280 align:start position:0%

like to speak to your Amendment yes I
 
00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:54.080 align:start position:0%
brought the amendment in and talked to
 
00:05:58.469 --> 00:05:58.479 align:start position:0%
um our chairman about it last week
 
00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:00.629 align:start position:0%
um our chairman about it last week
um

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:00.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
I I really brought it in for us to talk
 
00:06:06.309 --> 00:06:06.319 align:start position:0%
about in case there's ways that people
 
00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:09.000 align:start position:0%
think that they need to change it in
 
00:06:11.589 --> 00:06:11.599 align:start position:0%
some way we may need to take a look at
 
00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:14.720 align:start position:0%
this to be sure that it works um the
 
00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:17.160 align:start position:0%
original bill is about changing the
 
00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
ratios in child care allowing an extra
 
00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:23.160 align:start position:0%
child when there are two providers with
 
00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:25.280 align:start position:0%
um infants and
 
00:06:30.189 --> 00:06:30.199 align:start position:0%
toddlers And what I did was um
 
00:06:34.589 --> 00:06:34.599 align:start position:0%
Turn part of this into a waiver system
 
00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
so that if you decide at your child care
 
00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:40.520 align:start position:0%
facility that you would like to do this
 
00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:43.280 align:start position:0%
add the extra child then you would apply
 
00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:46.120 align:start position:0%
to the state to the uh Licensing Bureau
 
00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:50.800 align:start position:0%
for a waiver to allow you to um have the
 
00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:53.080 align:start position:0%
extra child
 
00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:56.280 align:start position:0%
um the waiver is down I think you can if
 
00:07:00.629 --> 00:07:00.639 align:start position:0%
you go to uh line 25 say section
 
00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:04.560 align:start position:0%
4 um it talks about the waiver and how
 
00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:08.680 align:start position:0%
it would work the department would
 
00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:13.240 align:start position:0%
um promate rules around any
 
00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:17.160 align:start position:0%
refusal uh for waivers um and there
 
00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:19.840 align:start position:0%
would not be any limit on the number of
 
00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:23.080 align:start position:0%
waivers so if there are 700 childcare
 
00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:25.720 align:start position:0%
providers in the state there would not
 
00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:28.520 align:start position:0%
be a limit on the number they couldn't
 
00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:31.000 align:start position:0%
say we only going to give a 100 waivers
 
00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:32.520 align:start position:0%
they would have to it would have to be
 
00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:35.240 align:start position:0%
open to every child care provider to
 
00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:38.680 align:start position:0%
apply and um that there could be no fee
 
00:07:41.629 --> 00:07:41.639 align:start position:0%
for the application of a waiver if you
 
00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:42.440 align:start position:0%
or the
 
00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:44.189 align:start position:0%
or the
renewal

00:07:44.189 --> 00:07:44.199 align:start position:0%
renewal
 
00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:48.280 align:start position:0%
um it calls for in section five it calls
 
00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:51.080 align:start position:0%
for the Department to
 
00:07:55.589 --> 00:07:55.599 align:start position:0%
report twice during this period um about
 
00:07:58.390 --> 00:07:58.400 align:start position:0%
the number of waivers the number of
 
00:08:00.909 --> 00:08:00.919 align:start position:0%
waiver denials there were so that we
 
00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:02.680 align:start position:0%
would have some information about how it
 
00:08:05.589 --> 00:08:05.599 align:start position:0%
was working and um whether people were
 
00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:07.720 align:start position:0%
using it what kinds of things the
 
00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
department was finding um as the process
 
00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:17.360 align:start position:0%
went on and the waiver process and ends
 
00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:23.000 align:start position:0%
and sunsets in uh November 1 no December
 
00:08:26.189 --> 00:08:26.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:29.400 align:start position:0%
2026 okay are questions uh further
 
00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:31.720 align:start position:0%
statements questions on the way on the
 
00:08:33.829 --> 00:08:33.839 align:start position:0%
amendment yes represented MC Williams uh
 
00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
thank you so much chair Barry um so I I
 
00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:39.760 align:start position:0%
think that this is a reasonable approach
 
00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:42.200 align:start position:0%
without having a study committee and the
 
00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:44.320 align:start position:0%
whole study process to look at this
 
00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:45.920 align:start position:0%
because I know we're in a childcare
 
00:08:48.269 --> 00:08:48.279 align:start position:0%
emergency um I think that doing this as
 
00:08:51.269 --> 00:08:51.279 align:start position:0%
sort of a pilot with a an end date
 
00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:53.120 align:start position:0%
allows us to collect the same data that
 
00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:54.640 align:start position:0%
we may be able to collect by doing a
 
00:08:57.230 --> 00:08:57.240 align:start position:0%
study but actually handson with real
 
00:08:59.870 --> 00:08:59.880 align:start position:0%
life examples of how it's working
 
00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:01.480 align:start position:0%
um and I really like this because I
 
00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:03.680 align:start position:0%
think that this is a potential uh
 
00:09:05.949 --> 00:09:05.959 align:start position:0%
Revenue stream for facilities that
 
00:09:08.509 --> 00:09:08.519 align:start position:0%
already have the demand for one more um
 
00:09:11.389 --> 00:09:11.399 align:start position:0%
infant or toddler and so they could free
 
00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:13.240 align:start position:0%
up and have that space and get the
 
00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:15.720 align:start position:0%
additional uh tuition for the infant or
 
00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:18.120 align:start position:0%
toddler without having to hire more
 
00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:20.760 align:start position:0%
staff so IT addresses that desire to be
 
00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:22.600 align:start position:0%
able to flex and take more kids that are
 
00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:25.480 align:start position:0%
on waiting lists right now um without
 
00:09:28.269 --> 00:09:28.279 align:start position:0%
making it um you know a a permanent
 
00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:29.680 align:start position:0%
thing because we're not really sure
 
00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:31.480 align:start position:0%
about the data so I like this because I
 
00:09:33.509 --> 00:09:33.519 align:start position:0%
see this as an interim step to getting
 
00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
to something permanent without diving
 
00:09:38.949 --> 00:09:38.959 align:start position:0%
right off the deep end um and I and so
 
00:09:40.069 --> 00:09:40.079 align:start position:0%
the centr interest in me thinks that
 
00:09:42.269 --> 00:09:42.279 align:start position:0%
this is a really nice clean approach um
 
00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:45.000 align:start position:0%
to to get the data further questions
 
00:09:47.829 --> 00:09:47.839 align:start position:0%
comments on the amendment um okay I'll
 
00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:50.760 align:start position:0%
give mine um I agree and I want to thank
 
00:09:52.509 --> 00:09:52.519 align:start position:0%
uh representative walner for working
 
00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:54.880 align:start position:0%
with me on this as you guys know this is
 
00:09:57.310 --> 00:09:57.320 align:start position:0%
kind of the thing that um was my
 
00:09:58.870 --> 00:09:58.880 align:start position:0%
immediate solution or at least first
 
00:10:00.949 --> 00:10:00.959 align:start position:0%
thought Solution on this um and I
 
00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
believe this was done in good faith um I
 
00:10:05.069 --> 00:10:05.079 align:start position:0%
am totally fine with the auto repal
 
00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:07.240 align:start position:0%
after 2 years um and the reason I'm
 
00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:08.560 align:start position:0%
totally fine with the auto repeal after
 
00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:10.760 align:start position:0%
two years is if I am wrong we can it
 
00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:12.880 align:start position:0%
goes away and if I'm right there will be
 
00:10:15.949 --> 00:10:15.959 align:start position:0%
a push to keep it um so I'm totally I'm
 
00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:17.480 align:start position:0%
totally fine to pick up the dice and
 
00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
roll them because I feel like they're
 
00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:22.160 align:start position:0%
going to land my way um you know it
 
00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:24.440 align:start position:0%
could come up seven you never know but
 
00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:27.800 align:start position:0%
uh I'm totally fine with this uh I think
 
00:10:29.389 --> 00:10:29.399 align:start position:0%
I think it actually does strike a very
 
00:10:31.389 --> 00:10:31.399 align:start position:0%
cous approach right and I appreciate
 
00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:32.920 align:start position:0%
representative walner addressing my
 
00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:35.000 align:start position:0%
concerns about not limiting the number
 
00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
of people that can apply not limiting
 
00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:37.880 align:start position:0%
the number of people that can be taken
 
00:10:39.829 --> 00:10:39.839 align:start position:0%
um I think it does give the department
 
00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:41.480 align:start position:0%
the flexibility if they see something
 
00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:44.040 align:start position:0%
that maybe a center is not operating at
 
00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:45.480 align:start position:0%
this level appropriately or there's a
 
00:10:47.069 --> 00:10:47.079 align:start position:0%
long history of safety violations and
 
00:10:48.509 --> 00:10:48.519 align:start position:0%
they go hey look you can barely handle
 
00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
four you really won't be able to handle
 
00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:53.680 align:start position:0%
four and a half um you know um I think
 
00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:55.880 align:start position:0%
that's actually very reasonable so I do
 
00:10:57.629 --> 00:10:57.639 align:start position:0%
appreciate the good faith effort on it
 
00:10:58.710 --> 00:10:58.720 align:start position:0%
um I look forward to voting for the
 
00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:00.160 align:start position:0%
amendment and then hopefully the passage
 
00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:01.680 align:start position:0%
of the underlying
 
00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:03.800 align:start position:0%

00:17:02.949 --> 00:17:02.959 align:start position:0%
doubled because of the insurance company
 
00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:06.640 align:start position:0%
going and pulling uh the
 
00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:11.640 align:start position:0%
report uh the violations report um and I
 
00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:12.760 align:start position:0%
never looked at her VI for the full
 
00:17:13.590 --> 00:17:13.600 align:start position:0%
disclosure I never looked at her
 
00:17:15.029 --> 00:17:15.039 align:start position:0%
violations report I'm taking on her word
 
00:17:16.110 --> 00:17:16.120 align:start position:0%
she said there wasn't there wasn't
 
00:17:18.189 --> 00:17:18.199 align:start position:0%
safety violations in
 
00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:21.160 align:start position:0%
there take her word on it um I can't I
 
00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:22.480 align:start position:0%
didn't I didn't I didn't trust but
 
00:17:25.669 --> 00:17:25.679 align:start position:0%
verify um so I I think what I want to
 
00:17:28.029 --> 00:17:28.039 align:start position:0%
say on this is I think there's more work
 
00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:30.200 align:start position:0%
to be done in this space I think the
 
00:17:31.630 --> 00:17:31.640 align:start position:0%
department needs to take a healthy look
 
00:17:34.029 --> 00:17:34.039 align:start position:0%
at how they're doing violations um these
 
00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:36.440 align:start position:0%
things are real um but that being said
 
00:17:37.789 --> 00:17:37.799 align:start position:0%
we did hear this would endanger the
 
00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:41.640 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund um and as much as I
 
00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:45.960 align:start position:0%
enjoy telling the feds where to go um
 
00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
it's not the juice is not worth the
 
00:17:51.549 --> 00:17:51.559 align:start position:0%
squeeze to endanger the fund for this so
 
00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:52.960 align:start position:0%
uh that's why I'm making an iil motion
 
00:17:55.390 --> 00:17:55.400 align:start position:0%
on my own bill but I do kind of want to
 
00:17:57.390 --> 00:17:57.400 align:start position:0%
have that said
 
00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:58.990 align:start position:0%
have that said
of

00:17:58.990 --> 00:17:59.000 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:18:00.669 --> 00:18:00.679 align:start position:0%
a a future solution to this problem
 
00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:03.200 align:start position:0%
would be awesome um this unfortunately
 
00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
is not it so um with that are there
 
00:18:09.029 --> 00:18:09.039 align:start position:0%
further discussions on the bill rest MC
 
00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:11.200 align:start position:0%
Williams thank you chair Barry just to
 
00:18:14.549 --> 00:18:14.559 align:start position:0%
comment that this special committee can
 
00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:17.240 align:start position:0%
and has the ability to create a working
 
00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:19.440 align:start position:0%
subcommittee on specific issues and this
 
00:18:22.390 --> 00:18:22.400 align:start position:0%
may be one that is worthwhile yeah it
 
00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:23.840 align:start position:0%
totally is and like I said I I would I
 
00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
would re I would I would have made the
 
00:18:28.789 --> 00:18:28.799 align:start position:0%
motion for is if I believed in is um but
 
00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:30.960 align:start position:0%
I don't um but I'm definitely down if we
 
00:18:32.669 --> 00:18:32.679 align:start position:0%
want to meet and discuss it for the next
 
00:18:35.149 --> 00:18:35.159 align:start position:0%
legislature to figure something out um
 
00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:37.440 align:start position:0%
it this just in my opinion once again
 
00:18:40.789 --> 00:18:40.799 align:start position:0%
I'm the sponsor uh it just wasn't it so
 
00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
uh further yes represent mean um I'll
 
00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
just add we did hear from the Department
 
00:18:47.789 --> 00:18:47.799 align:start position:0%
that they were in contact with um the
 
00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:49.440 align:start position:0%
insurance commissioner and trying to
 
00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
work some things out um that way and
 
00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:54.120 align:start position:0%
felt that those discussions were were
 
00:18:56.430 --> 00:18:56.440 align:start position:0%
being fruitful so hopefully we'll get
 
00:18:58.470 --> 00:18:58.480 align:start position:0%
some action on that even without our our
 
00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:01.000 align:start position:0%
committee meeting if it could be solved
 
00:19:02.669 --> 00:19:02.679 align:start position:0%
without legislation even
 
00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
better okay um any other
 
00:19:08.950 --> 00:19:08.960 align:start position:0%

it uh we'll open up that close the
 
00:20:57.870 --> 00:20:57.880 align:start position:0%
executive session of 405 I'm going to
 
00:21:00.549 --> 00:21:00.559 align:start position:0%
open the execution T from 1409 uh
 
00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
relative to review by The Advisory
 
00:21:04.909 --> 00:21:04.919 align:start position:0%
Council on child care of child care
 
00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
center violations um uh I'll make a
 
00:21:09.990 --> 00:21:10.000 align:start position:0%
motion of inexpedient to legislate on
 
00:21:12.590 --> 00:21:12.600 align:start position:0%
this um but is there a
 
00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
second second uh I would love to discuss
 
00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:19.200 align:start position:0%
it just so you know um and because I do
 
00:21:21.149 --> 00:21:21.159 align:start position:0%
think you know this bill is not ready
 
00:21:22.190 --> 00:21:22.200 align:start position:0%
for prime time I knew that when I
 
00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:23.360 align:start position:0%
submitted it nobody seemed to really
 
00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:25.880 align:start position:0%
want to work on it other than me um that
 
00:21:28.190 --> 00:21:28.200 align:start position:0%
being said I do think there needs to be
 
00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:30.320 align:start position:0%
some sort of a Jud
 
00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:33.400 align:start position:0%
uh uh appeals process that doesn't go
 
00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:35.720 align:start position:0%
through the same judge jury and
 
00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:39.240 align:start position:0%
executioner um and you know if we wanted
 
00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:40.720 align:start position:0%
to take another hack at this I'm happy
 
00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:42.400 align:start position:0%
to pull back the itl motion and we can
 
00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:44.960 align:start position:0%
take another hack at it but um nobody
 
00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:49.480 align:start position:0%
approached me on it so I put in the
 
00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:52.520 align:start position:0%
child care advisory committee um without
 
00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:53.549 align:start position:0%
child care advisory committee um without
asking

00:21:53.549 --> 00:21:53.559 align:start position:0%
asking
 
00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
them um because they were the most
 
00:21:58.830 --> 00:21:58.840 align:start position:0%
logical body to go to um so you know
 
00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:00.320 align:start position:0%
it's just one of those deals during LSR
 
00:22:01.789 --> 00:22:01.799 align:start position:0%
filing I was like well I hope they like
 
00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:06.360 align:start position:0%
this maybe they won't who knows um but I
 
00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:09.240 align:start position:0%
there is a legitimate concern I think
 
00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:10.590 align:start position:0%
there is a legitimate concern I think
with

00:22:10.590 --> 00:22:10.600 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
DHHS making a finding you appeal that
 
00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:17.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:22.480 align:start position:0%
that uh licensers supervisor who then is
 
00:22:24.269 --> 00:22:24.279 align:start position:0%
let's be honest probably predisposed to
 
00:22:26.909 --> 00:22:26.919 align:start position:0%
backup their licenser they're going to
 
00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:28.520 align:start position:0%
refute that statement but we all live in
 
00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:32.440 align:start position:0%
reality and we know that's the truth um
 
00:22:34.269 --> 00:22:34.279 align:start position:0%
and then after that you kind of exhaust
 
00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
your options and then you might have to
 
00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:37.880 align:start position:0%
go to court um which no childcare
 
00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:38.840 align:start position:0%
Center's going to do they're just going
 
00:22:41.230 --> 00:22:41.240 align:start position:0%
to be like all right take it and move on
 
00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:43.640 align:start position:0%
um but I do hear about in my
 
00:22:46.269 --> 00:22:46.279 align:start position:0%
conversations with owners there's like a
 
00:22:48.269 --> 00:22:48.279 align:start position:0%
legitimate I wouldn't say legi maybe
 
00:22:49.669 --> 00:22:49.679 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a real we heard about
 
00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:52.000 align:start position:0%
it in our public our public listening
 
00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
session in Manchester um when we
 
00:22:57.070 --> 00:22:57.080 align:start position:0%
actually had the most owners operators
 
00:22:58.190 --> 00:22:58.200 align:start position:0%
show up that was the one where we had
 
00:22:59.669 --> 00:22:59.679 align:start position:0%
the most operators show up um and the
 
00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:00.720 align:start position:0%
reason we had the most operators there
 
00:23:04.909 --> 00:23:04.919 align:start position:0%
was because I invited 330 of them
 
00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:08.400 align:start position:0%
um there is when I talk to childcare
 
00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:12.640 align:start position:0%
workers who are in management or owners
 
00:23:15.029 --> 00:23:15.039 align:start position:0%
they fear the department there's they
 
00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:16.480 align:start position:0%
fear them they they tell me they're
 
00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
scared um and this was my thought
 
00:23:23.710 --> 00:23:23.720 align:start position:0%
process solution of well here's a way to
 
00:23:26.149 --> 00:23:26.159 align:start position:0%
make the boogeyman not so bad um you'll
 
00:23:27.669 --> 00:23:27.679 align:start position:0%
have you can go in front of somebody who
 
00:23:30.029 --> 00:23:30.039 align:start position:0%
is like you uh and they can determine if
 
00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:32.320 align:start position:0%
it was legitimate um doesn't mean by the
 
00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
way you're going to get off um it just
 
00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:36.240 align:start position:0%
means that you have in a process that's
 
00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:38.640 align:start position:0%
outside of the judge jury and
 
00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:40.760 align:start position:0%
executioner um that's not a condemnation
 
00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:43.720 align:start position:0%
of DHHS that's not they're the bad
 
00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:44.960 align:start position:0%
people they're the bad guys I'm not
 
00:23:46.029 --> 00:23:46.039 align:start position:0%
saying that I'm just saying the
 
00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
perception is reality and that's how
 
00:23:50.549 --> 00:23:50.559 align:start position:0%
they perceive it um I'll speak from
 
00:23:53.390 --> 00:23:53.400 align:start position:0%
personal um experience having the
 
00:23:54.669 --> 00:23:54.679 align:start position:0%
government come into your business is
 
00:23:57.149 --> 00:23:57.159 align:start position:0%
very invasive I get it I'm not saying
 
00:23:58.789 --> 00:23:58.799 align:start position:0%
DHHS should shouldn't inspect in fact I
 
00:24:00.669 --> 00:24:00.679 align:start position:0%
think there was a survey I want to say
 
00:24:02.190 --> 00:24:02.200 align:start position:0%
was it last week that they that's one of
 
00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
the advocacy groups sent out about DHHS
 
00:24:05.470 --> 00:24:05.480 align:start position:0%
is proposing a rule right right now they
 
00:24:08.029 --> 00:24:08.039 align:start position:0%
do one unsupervised one unannounced
 
00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:09.200 align:start position:0%
visit a year and they're going to
 
00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:10.960 align:start position:0%
they're talking about moving to a system
 
00:24:13.549 --> 00:24:13.559 align:start position:0%
of one announced visit um and one
 
00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:15.240 align:start position:0%
unannounced visit the announced visit
 
00:24:17.029 --> 00:24:17.039 align:start position:0%
being for the purposes of of uh
 
00:24:19.149 --> 00:24:19.159 align:start position:0%
paperwork compliance um so you guys know
 
00:24:20.310 --> 00:24:20.320 align:start position:0%
I voted against it just because I was
 
00:24:22.350 --> 00:24:22.360 align:start position:0%
like you're just coming in one more time
 
00:24:24.269 --> 00:24:24.279 align:start position:0%
uh but I totally actually appreciate D
 
00:24:26.350 --> 00:24:26.360 align:start position:0%
hhs's idea there of hey we're going to
 
00:24:27.909 --> 00:24:27.919 align:start position:0%
come and look at paperwork on this dat
 
00:24:28.870 --> 00:24:28.880 align:start position:0%
and then we're going to come by and do
 
00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
our random on the other date um so I
 
00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:32.640 align:start position:0%
think that that I think that that will
 
00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
be helpful I just could in good faith
 
00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:36.240 align:start position:0%
vote to have the government come in like
 
00:24:38.070 --> 00:24:38.080 align:start position:0%
guaranteed one more time um even though
 
00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:41.360 align:start position:0%
I know they're already doing it twice um
 
00:24:43.950 --> 00:24:43.960 align:start position:0%
but I I think that this committee needs
 
00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
to and maybe it's something else that we
 
00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
can do a working group on and study
 
00:24:48.990 --> 00:24:49.000 align:start position:0%
because you actually public hearing I
 
00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
didn't even realize this the Realtors
 
00:24:52.669 --> 00:24:52.679 align:start position:0%
kind of have some
 
00:24:55.070 --> 00:24:55.080 align:start position:0%
self-regulation um obviously real
 
00:24:57.990 --> 00:24:58.000 align:start position:0%
estate's a lot different than childcare
 
00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:00.480 align:start position:0%
but uh I do think that with the
 
00:25:03.269 --> 00:25:03.279 align:start position:0%
legislator would be wise to if not now
 
00:25:05.950 --> 00:25:05.960 align:start position:0%
but in the future find something that
 
00:25:09.070 --> 00:25:09.080 align:start position:0%
addresses this concern from operators um
 
00:25:11.190 --> 00:25:11.200 align:start position:0%
at a minimum just to let's call it
 
00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:14.520 align:start position:0%
increase a level of perceived fairness
 
00:25:16.190 --> 00:25:16.200 align:start position:0%
um so that'll be my monologue on this
 
00:25:17.909 --> 00:25:17.919 align:start position:0%
subject I'm happy to hear from anyone
 
00:25:21.070 --> 00:25:21.080 align:start position:0%
else uh representative wner so I think
 
00:25:23.070 --> 00:25:23.080 align:start position:0%
that we heard
 
00:25:27.070 --> 00:25:27.080 align:start position:0%
um that right now as the rules are the
 
00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
childcare rules are being looked at and
 
00:25:32.149 --> 00:25:32.159 align:start position:0%
uh worked on that this is something that
 
00:25:34.909 --> 00:25:34.919 align:start position:0%
they are considering within the rules so
 
00:25:37.710 --> 00:25:37.720 align:start position:0%
I think before we pass any sort of law
 
00:25:39.789 --> 00:25:39.799 align:start position:0%
it might be good to see what happens in
 
00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:41.640 align:start position:0%
the rules and maybe have them come back
 
00:25:44.590 --> 00:25:44.600 align:start position:0%
and tell us exactly how they you know
 
00:25:47.310 --> 00:25:47.320 align:start position:0%
how the new rules address this issue
 
00:25:49.630 --> 00:25:49.640 align:start position:0%
yeah I I think that would be good um and
 
00:25:51.549 --> 00:25:51.559 align:start position:0%
I I'll Circle up with DHHS afterwards
 
00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:52.880 align:start position:0%
and figure out where we are and I know
 
00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:54.840 align:start position:0%
they're approaching the finality of that
 
00:25:59.590 --> 00:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
process um and we've said before for
 
00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
are Subs uh basically DHHS in the
 
00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:05.240 align:start position:0%
process of going through all of the
 
00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:07.520 align:start position:0%
child care rules right now um and
 
00:26:09.070 --> 00:26:09.080 align:start position:0%
producing a more streamlined version of
 
00:26:10.950 --> 00:26:10.960 align:start position:0%
it and I'm very very thankful that they
 
00:26:14.350 --> 00:26:14.360 align:start position:0%
are doing that um so but anyways so we
 
00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
we'll Circle back on this we're going to
 
00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:17.360 align:start position:0%
iil this bill right now uh wait for the
 
00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
rules U or at least I'm going to vote
 
00:26:22.710 --> 00:26:22.720 align:start position:0%
for iil what you do is your business but
 
00:26:25.029 --> 00:26:25.039 align:start position:0%
uh but I think that needs to be said I
 
00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
think the department should hear that um
 
00:26:31.029 --> 00:26:31.039 align:start position:0%
because like I'll say it but you know
 
00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:32.760 align:start position:0%
your average operator your average
 
00:26:34.389 --> 00:26:34.399 align:start position:0%
director won't have the courage to say
 
00:26:36.029 --> 00:26:36.039 align:start position:0%
it but they'll say it they won't say it
 
00:26:37.909 --> 00:26:37.919 align:start position:0%
to you but they'll say it to me um and
 
00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
they're not wrong so with that the cler
 
00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
sorry represent MC Williams I apologize
 
00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
that's okay I'll be very brief um I
 
00:26:45.269 --> 00:26:45.279 align:start position:0%
agree with everything that you've said
 
00:26:47.630 --> 00:26:47.640 align:start position:0%
and this Echoes exactly the testimony we
 
00:26:49.269 --> 00:26:49.279 align:start position:0%
received when we did a study on the
 
00:26:50.789 --> 00:26:50.799 align:start position:0%
success of the business of child care
 
00:26:52.909 --> 00:26:52.919 align:start position:0%
about six years ago um do you think that
 
00:26:54.590 --> 00:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
the board of realtors is a good model
 
00:26:57.269 --> 00:26:57.279 align:start position:0%
for um an internal review uh there are
 
00:26:57.279 --> 00:26:58.149 align:start position:0%
for um an internal review uh there are
other

00:26:58.149 --> 00:26:58.159 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:27:00.830 --> 00:27:00.840 align:start position:0%
uh groups that have something similar um
 
00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
so I think that uh perhaps having a
 
00:27:06.350 --> 00:27:06.360 align:start position:0%
presentation by DHHS uh as part of one
 
00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:07.840 align:start position:0%
of our upcoming meetings would be
 
00:27:10.630 --> 00:27:10.640 align:start position:0%
helpful perhaps when after crossover uh
 
00:27:12.990 --> 00:27:13.000 align:start position:0%
we could ask for that presentation on an
 
00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:16.200 align:start position:0%
update uh and I also think that um we
 
00:27:18.750 --> 00:27:18.760 align:start position:0%
could ask for some research on what
 
00:27:21.470 --> 00:27:21.480 align:start position:0%
other agencies do for appeals from our
 
00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
uh researcher I think that's actually a
 
00:27:25.990 --> 00:27:26.000 align:start position:0%
great idea yeah so I don't want to give
 
00:27:28.029 --> 00:27:28.039 align:start position:0%
up on this bill I understand the itl
 
00:27:31.789 --> 00:27:31.799 align:start position:0%
motion but I I completely champion this
 
00:27:33.669 --> 00:27:33.679 align:start position:0%
having an appeal that's outside of judge
 
00:27:36.669 --> 00:27:36.679 align:start position:0%
jury and executioner so do you want to
 
00:27:38.950 --> 00:27:38.960 align:start position:0%
do you want to pull it back and we just
 
00:27:40.990 --> 00:27:41.000 align:start position:0%
sit on it for a minute or do you want to
 
00:27:43.029 --> 00:27:43.039 align:start position:0%
kill it I I don't want to kill it I want
 
00:27:46.509 --> 00:27:46.519 align:start position:0%
to fight for it um I I I would rather
 
00:27:48.269 --> 00:27:48.279 align:start position:0%
interim study but you don't do interim
 
00:27:50.269 --> 00:27:50.279 align:start position:0%
study uh I think that this is the sort
 
00:27:51.669 --> 00:27:51.679 align:start position:0%
of thing we want to keep alive so that
 
00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:54.240 align:start position:0%
it's top of mind um and certainly keep
 
00:27:55.389 --> 00:27:55.399 align:start position:0%
on the list of things that we are
 
00:27:57.149 --> 00:27:57.159 align:start position:0%
studying as a committee whether or not
 
00:27:59.230 --> 00:27:59.240 align:start position:0%
there's a Bill assigned to it it's nice
 
00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:01.960 align:start position:0%
to have an empty vehicle to shove some
 
00:28:04.110 --> 00:28:04.120 align:start position:0%
stuff in at the last minute um this
 
00:28:05.470 --> 00:28:05.480 align:start position:0%
might be one of those things we hang on
 
00:28:08.029 --> 00:28:08.039 align:start position:0%
to so if we were to not execute today
 
00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
that would not be such a bad thing uh
 
00:28:11.549 --> 00:28:11.559 align:start position:0%
but also I think that there really are
 
00:28:13.149 --> 00:28:13.159 align:start position:0%
legs and there's something going on here
 
00:28:15.470 --> 00:28:15.480 align:start position:0%
that I don't want to give up on today I
 
00:28:16.830 --> 00:28:16.840 align:start position:0%
don't I don't we'll have we'll hear from
 
00:28:18.149 --> 00:28:18.159 align:start position:0%
representative creation and then I
 
00:28:19.190 --> 00:28:19.200 align:start position:0%
will'll see what your ranking member
 
00:28:20.269 --> 00:28:20.279 align:start position:0%
says because she I don't know if she
 
00:28:23.950 --> 00:28:23.960 align:start position:0%
fully agrees but that's okay sure um
 
00:28:26.230 --> 00:28:26.240 align:start position:0%
again just looking back at the minutes
 
00:28:29.070 --> 00:28:29.080 align:start position:0%
from the last meeting um Melissa Clement
 
00:28:32.509 --> 00:28:32.519 align:start position:0%
said uh they're already looking at doing
 
00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:34.240 align:start position:0%
something like this modeling it after
 
00:28:36.350 --> 00:28:36.360 align:start position:0%
their adult process and that the child
 
00:28:39.029 --> 00:28:39.039 align:start position:0%
care advisory panel is helping them seat
 
00:28:41.789 --> 00:28:41.799 align:start position:0%
the panel um but not be the panel um and
 
00:28:44.750 --> 00:28:44.760 align:start position:0%
so they they all seem to agree that we
 
00:28:48.750 --> 00:28:48.760 align:start position:0%
don't need anything in statute um right
 
00:28:51.669 --> 00:28:51.679 align:start position:0%
now I I don't have very strong feelings
 
00:28:54.269 --> 00:28:54.279 align:start position:0%
on keeping an empty vehicle alive I
 
00:28:56.590 --> 00:28:56.600 align:start position:0%
guess but just wanted to just wanted to
 
00:28:58.630 --> 00:28:58.640 align:start position:0%
make sure that I read iterated what was
 
00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
said representative representative
 
00:29:05.669 --> 00:29:05.679 align:start position:0%
wner well just to say what I said before
 
00:29:07.509 --> 00:29:07.519 align:start position:0%
what I'd like to do is I I would like to
 
00:29:10.230 --> 00:29:10.240 align:start position:0%
just itl the bill at this point let the
 
00:29:12.669 --> 00:29:12.679 align:start position:0%
department and the child care advisory
 
00:29:16.110 --> 00:29:16.120 align:start position:0%
committee um work through a proposal
 
00:29:17.350 --> 00:29:17.360 align:start position:0%
that they're going to put in they're
 
00:29:20.990 --> 00:29:21.000 align:start position:0%
going to suggest for rules and then have
 
00:29:24.950 --> 00:29:24.960 align:start position:0%
them come in and describe to us how
 
00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
they're going to move forward um with
 
00:29:31.350 --> 00:29:31.360 align:start position:0%
this idea and um
 
00:29:34.350 --> 00:29:34.360 align:start position:0%
then if doesn't seem like it's something
 
00:29:35.870 --> 00:29:35.880 align:start position:0%
that's workable we might bring in
 
00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:40.200 align:start position:0%
legislation for um next year
 
00:29:43.950 --> 00:29:43.960 align:start position:0%
I I think what I'm going to do I think
 
00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:45.360 align:start position:0%
I'm changing my mind I'm going to what
 
00:29:46.509 --> 00:29:46.519 align:start position:0%
I'm going to do is I'm going to recess
 
00:29:49.430 --> 00:29:49.440 align:start position:0%
this bill I I uh I I appreciate the
 
00:29:52.310 --> 00:29:52.320 align:start position:0%
ranking member I like the idea if if
 
00:29:54.310 --> 00:29:54.320 align:start position:0%
there's going to be genuine work on it I
 
00:29:55.950 --> 00:29:55.960 align:start position:0%
like the idea of keeping a vehicle out
 
00:29:59.909 --> 00:29:59.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:02.630 --> 00:30:02.640 align:start position:0%
because I don't if we don't
 
00:30:05.029 --> 00:30:05.039 align:start position:0%
have if I was to predict the future I
 
00:30:06.389 --> 00:30:06.399 align:start position:0%
would I predict I'm going to regret
 
00:30:07.430 --> 00:30:07.440 align:start position:0%
doing this and I'm gonna have to come
 
00:30:09.310 --> 00:30:09.320 align:start position:0%
back in two months and I all the bill so
 
00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:10.960 align:start position:0%
let me just start off with I believe
 
00:30:12.590 --> 00:30:12.600 align:start position:0%
that that's where it's going to go that
 
00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:13.669 align:start position:0%
that that's where it's going to go that
being

00:30:13.669 --> 00:30:13.679 align:start position:0%
being
 
00:30:18.070 --> 00:30:18.080 align:start position:0%
said if DHHS is almost done and we see
 
00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:20.480 align:start position:0%
something that needs to be changed this
 
00:30:23.909 --> 00:30:23.919 align:start position:0%
gives us an option um so I think what
 
00:30:25.470 --> 00:30:25.480 align:start position:0%
I'm going to do is I'm going to recess
 
00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
the bill and we'll leave the vehicle
 
00:30:30.830 --> 00:30:30.840 align:start position:0%
alive I understand we're going to
 
00:30:33.310 --> 00:30:33.320 align:start position:0%
probably itl It Anyways um but I like
 
00:30:34.549 --> 00:30:34.559 align:start position:0%
the idea of having something there in
 
00:30:36.950 --> 00:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
case the HHS finds something that they
 
00:30:39.669 --> 00:30:39.679 align:start position:0%
say hey we actually need to change this
 
00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:41.360 align:start position:0%
um or the advisory Council comes forward
 
00:30:43.350 --> 00:30:43.360 align:start position:0%
and says hey uh this is how we want this
 
00:30:44.909 --> 00:30:44.919 align:start position:0%
is how we want this to look and DHHS
 
00:30:46.509 --> 00:30:46.519 align:start position:0%
doesn't agree and we can go okay well we
 
00:30:48.789 --> 00:30:48.799 align:start position:0%
agree so we move forward um so I'm going
 
00:30:50.990 --> 00:30:51.000 align:start position:0%
to recess that I'm going to recess the
 
00:30:52.549 --> 00:30:52.559 align:start position:0%
bill we we' never entered the voting
 
00:30:54.669 --> 00:30:54.679 align:start position:0%
mode so when we when we come back from
 
00:30:56.669 --> 00:30:56.679 align:start position:0%
recess we will be on an itl motion just
 
00:30:58.590 --> 00:30:58.600 align:start position:0%
so you guys know know the the the the
 
00:30:59.950 --> 00:30:59.960 align:start position:0%
stance of the committee will be on an
 
00:31:04.830 --> 00:31:04.840 align:start position:0%
itl motion um but we won't uh we won't
 
00:31:07.190 --> 00:31:07.200 align:start position:0%
do it today um and maybe we'll come back
 
00:31:09.190 --> 00:31:09.200 align:start position:0%
in two we can handle in two weeks if we
 
00:31:11.870 --> 00:31:11.880 align:start position:0%
Circle up and talk privately and and
 
00:31:13.549 --> 00:31:13.559 align:start position:0%
decide we're not going we can we're
 
00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
meeting in two weeks anyway so it's it's
 
00:31:18.389 --> 00:31:18.399 align:start position:0%
it doesn't matter um all right and then
 
00:31:21.509 --> 00:31:21.519 align:start position:0%
I'll open uh I'll open up I'll close the
