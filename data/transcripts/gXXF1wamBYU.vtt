00:13:57.910 --> 00:13:57.920 align:start position:0%
mr speaker we have passed house bill 52
 
00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:00.320 align:start position:0%
and i understand that it's on your desk
 
00:14:02.629 --> 00:14:02.639 align:start position:0%
somewheres and we could find it and blow
 
00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:04.880 align:start position:0%
the dust off it
 
00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:06.800 align:start position:0%
and send it to the governor's desk for
 
00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:08.160 align:start position:0%
his signature
 
00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:10.160 align:start position:0%
and no court involvement would have to
 
00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:12.870 align:start position:0%
and no court involvement would have to
happen

00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:16.389 --> 00:14:16.399 align:start position:0%
house bill 52 is available to us
 
00:14:19.269 --> 00:14:19.279 align:start position:0%
if this fails
 
00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
for that reason mr speaker
 
00:14:24.389 --> 00:14:24.399 align:start position:0%
you will be forever
 
00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
in my heart if you join me in pressing
 
00:14:29.509 --> 00:14:29.519 align:start position:0%
the bright red button
 
00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:32.240 align:start position:0%
as i will be doing mr speaker and i
 
00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
would like a division vote
 
00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:38.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:46.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:48.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:50.480 align:start position:0%
mr speaker i originally
 
00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
spoke against this bill it was changed
 
00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
in the state senate and i was going to
 
00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:55.189 align:start position:0%
in the state senate and i was going to
come

00:14:55.189 --> 00:14:55.199 align:start position:0%
come
 
00:14:58.069 --> 00:14:58.079 align:start position:0%
here today and speak against it again
 
00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:00.720 align:start position:0%
however in the the spirit of compromise
 
00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:02.240 align:start position:0%
and recognizing that certain changes
 
00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:04.240 align:start position:0%
were made to make the district
 
00:15:06.069 --> 00:15:06.079 align:start position:0%
map more compact
 
00:15:08.629 --> 00:15:08.639 align:start position:0%
uh using a shorter line making it more
 
00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:10.480 align:start position:0%
even and i think more fair and putting
 
00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:12.800 align:start position:0%
the voters back in control
 
00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
i'm i will be voting in favor of this so
 
00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:17.600 align:start position:0%
i wore the red the wrong color today i
 
00:15:19.189 --> 00:15:19.199 align:start position:0%

00:15:20.629 --> 00:15:20.639 align:start position:0%
next time i'll remember to wear a green
 
00:15:20.639 --> 00:15:21.590 align:start position:0%
next time i'll remember to wear a green
shirt

00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
shirt
 
00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:24.560 align:start position:0%
thank you please press the green button
 
00:15:32.389 --> 00:15:32.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:34.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker i rise today in
 
00:15:36.069 --> 00:15:36.079 align:start position:0%
opposition to the committee of
 
00:15:38.949 --> 00:15:38.959 align:start position:0%
conference report on senate bill 200.
 
00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:40.720 align:start position:0%
during the redistricting process the
 
00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:42.720 align:start position:0%
house special committee on redistricting
 
00:15:45.509 --> 00:15:45.519 align:start position:0%
held listing sessions in all 10 counties
 
00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:46.880 align:start position:0%
and conducted a number of public
 
00:15:49.509 --> 00:15:49.519 align:start position:0%
hearings on redistricting proposals
 
00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:51.440 align:start position:0%
at no time did members of the committee
 
00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:52.880 align:start position:0%
hear calls for the congressional
 
00:15:56.470 --> 00:15:56.480 align:start position:0%
districts to undergo radical changes
 
00:15:57.829 --> 00:15:57.839 align:start position:0%
the committee of conference report
 
00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:00.880 align:start position:0%
proposes moving 34 cities and towns from
 
00:16:03.189 --> 00:16:03.199 align:start position:0%
one district to another with a total
 
00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:06.040 align:start position:0%
population of 314
 
00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:10.880 align:start position:0%
755 people being moved between districts
 
00:16:12.629 --> 00:16:12.639 align:start position:0%
it places new hampshire's three largest
 
00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:14.560 align:start position:0%
cities into district two
 
00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
which will disenfranchise less populated
 
00:16:19.749 --> 00:16:19.759 align:start position:0%
and more rural areas of the state
 
00:16:21.269 --> 00:16:21.279 align:start position:0%
proponents have argued that this plan is
 
00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:23.360 align:start position:0%
a good one because there is a population
 
00:16:24.949 --> 00:16:24.959 align:start position:0%
difference between the two congressional
 
00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:27.680 align:start position:0%
districts of only 53 people but the
 
00:16:29.749 --> 00:16:29.759 align:start position:0%
house has already rejected a proposal
 
00:16:32.949 --> 00:16:32.959 align:start position:0%
with a difference of just 51 people
 
00:16:34.389 --> 00:16:34.399 align:start position:0%
proponents have argued that it doesn't
 
00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:36.160 align:start position:0%
matter if our two congressional
 
00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
representatives would now be living in
 
00:16:39.749 --> 00:16:39.759 align:start position:0%
the same district because a candidate
 
00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:41.360 align:start position:0%
for congress does not need to live in
 
00:16:43.749 --> 00:16:43.759 align:start position:0%
the district in which he is a candidate
 
00:16:45.509 --> 00:16:45.519 align:start position:0%
but the last person who ran for congress
 
00:16:47.509 --> 00:16:47.519 align:start position:0%
who did not live in the district in
 
00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:49.360 align:start position:0%
which he was running received less than
 
00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:52.000 align:start position:0%
two percent of the vote
 
00:16:53.509 --> 00:16:53.519 align:start position:0%
the proposed plan shifts the first
 
00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:55.040 align:start position:0%
congressional district about three
 
00:16:57.030 --> 00:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
percentage points towards republicans in
 
00:16:59.189 --> 00:16:59.199 align:start position:0%
the second congressional district about
 
00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:02.240 align:start position:0%
three percentage points toward democrats
 
00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:04.160 align:start position:0%
by trying to pack republican votes into
 
00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
one district the proposal makes the
 
00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:08.640 align:start position:0%
other district more democratic
 
00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:10.640 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is a purple state we have
 
00:17:12.789 --> 00:17:12.799 align:start position:0%
a republican governor who carried both
 
00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:14.400 align:start position:0%
congressional districts in previous
 
00:17:16.309 --> 00:17:16.319 align:start position:0%
elections and we have democratic
 
00:17:18.069 --> 00:17:18.079 align:start position:0%
congressional representatives in each of
 
00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:19.520 align:start position:0%
the two districts
 
00:17:21.429 --> 00:17:21.439 align:start position:0%
over the past 10 years the legislature
 
00:17:23.590 --> 00:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
has shifted back and forth between
 
00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:26.400 align:start position:0%
democratic and republican control
 
00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:28.400 align:start position:0%
the districts have been competitive the
 
00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
people of new hampshire deserve to keep
 
00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:31.520 align:start position:0%
both of their congressional districts
 
00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:33.760 align:start position:0%
competitive there is no overriding
 
00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
interest in making such massive changes
 
00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:38.000 align:start position:0%
to the congressional districts i would
 
00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:39.760 align:start position:0%
ask therefore that you vote against this
 
00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
report by pressing the red note button
 
00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:48.640 align:start position:0%

00:18:00.310 --> 00:18:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:03.520 align:start position:0%
i rise today to support the committee of
 
00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:04.880 align:start position:0%
conference report
 
00:18:06.789 --> 00:18:06.799 align:start position:0%
sometimes how things look depends on
 
00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:08.320 align:start position:0%
where you're standing when you look at
 
00:18:11.029 --> 00:18:11.039 align:start position:0%
them i live in cd too
 
00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:13.120 align:start position:0%
contrary to what you heard before i have
 
00:18:15.029 --> 00:18:15.039 align:start position:0%
been advocating for radical change
 
00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:16.720 align:start position:0%
throughout this process because it
 
00:18:19.029 --> 00:18:19.039 align:start position:0%
doesn't look great from where i live
 
00:18:20.549 --> 00:18:20.559 align:start position:0%
about a third of the way up the vermont
 
00:18:20.559 --> 00:18:21.510 align:start position:0%
about a third of the way up the vermont
border

00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:21.520 align:start position:0%
border
 
00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:22.640 align:start position:0%
the current
 
00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:25.280 align:start position:0%
horrifically gerrymandered map that we
 
00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:26.150 align:start position:0%
horrifically gerrymandered map that we
have

00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
reaches all the way down under cd1 over
 
00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:32.480 align:start position:0%
to atkinson and then up to canada
 
00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:34.880 align:start position:0%
what kind of sense does that make
 
00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
it's the district of the rest of us
 
00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:40.240 align:start position:0%
i get that the bulk of the population is
 
00:18:42.150 --> 00:18:42.160 align:start position:0%
packed into the bottom right corner of
 
00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:43.840 align:start position:0%
the state and it's probably going to
 
00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:46.240 align:start position:0%
stay that way but can't we do better
 
00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:48.720 align:start position:0%
this map does better it gets rid of the
 
00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:50.720 align:start position:0%
ridiculous fingers that we have reaching
 
00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:53.120 align:start position:0%
across the street the state creates a
 
00:18:55.590 --> 00:18:55.600 align:start position:0%
more sensible shape and i know we're not
 
00:18:57.350 --> 00:18:57.360 align:start position:0%
allowed to use props but try to
 
00:18:59.190 --> 00:18:59.200 align:start position:0%
visualize this with me
 
00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:01.200 align:start position:0%
turn the map that we have 90 degrees
 
00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
clockwise what do you get on the left
 
00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:05.840 align:start position:0%
you have the horseshoe or starfleet
 
00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:08.080 align:start position:0%
emblem that everybody derided on the
 
00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:10.400 align:start position:0%
other map that we passed it's not quite
 
00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:12.640 align:start position:0%
as big and that's because it is joined
 
00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:14.480 align:start position:0%
by the all the other little horseshoes
 
00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:16.400 align:start position:0%
to the right i mean you drive towards
 
00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:18.400 align:start position:0%
vermont for 45 minutes or an hour
 
00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:20.640 align:start position:0%
depending on the traffic you bang a uae
 
00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:22.400 align:start position:0%
and head back to the coast for a half
 
00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:23.270 align:start position:0%
and head back to the coast for a half
hour

00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
hour
 
00:19:25.029 --> 00:19:25.039 align:start position:0%
does that make sense
 
00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:26.960 align:start position:0%
just because it's always been that way
 
00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
should we support it no
 
00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:31.360 align:start position:0%
every ten years it is the job of the
 
00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:34.160 align:start position:0%
legislature to come up with a plan
 
00:19:36.789 --> 00:19:36.799 align:start position:0%
not figure out if the old plan's okay
 
00:19:38.549 --> 00:19:38.559 align:start position:0%
can we maybe you know just tweak it a
 
00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:41.200 align:start position:0%
little but to come up with a plan that
 
00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
makes sense today
 
00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
i heard somebody say the original
 
00:19:46.789 --> 00:19:46.799 align:start position:0%
districts have been pretty much the same
 
00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:48.640 align:start position:0%
since the 1800s
 
00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:50.400 align:start position:0%
when we were moving stuff around the
 
00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:54.320 align:start position:0%
state by steam train horse and wagon
 
00:19:56.950 --> 00:19:56.960 align:start position:0%
and and riverboats come on the state has
 
00:19:58.789 --> 00:19:58.799 align:start position:0%
changed this plan makes sense what does
 
00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
it do we don't reach around city under
 
00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:03.110 align:start position:0%
it do we don't reach around city under
cd1

00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
cd1
 
00:20:05.029 --> 00:20:05.039 align:start position:0%
all the way to atkinson we have a more
 
00:20:07.669 --> 00:20:07.679 align:start position:0%
sensible east-west barrier i'd like to
 
00:20:10.789 --> 00:20:10.799 align:start position:0%
see districts that were almost east-west
 
00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:12.400 align:start position:0%
i didn't get that
 
00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:14.720 align:start position:0%
but we didn't have a step towards making
 
00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:16.320 align:start position:0%
better progress
 
00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:18.320 align:start position:0%
so for those reasons that's why i'm
 
00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
going to vote for this today it's a step
 
00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
in the right direction the districts are
 
00:20:23.909 --> 00:20:23.919 align:start position:0%
certainly competitive
 
00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
we're not supposed to talk about the
 
00:20:27.190 --> 00:20:27.200 align:start position:0%
political stuff i'm going to
 
00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
if you take the results of the 2020
 
00:20:31.669 --> 00:20:31.679 align:start position:0%
election and put it in here
 
00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:34.480 align:start position:0%
mr mowers still would have lost so this
 
00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:37.600 align:start position:0%
is into trying to stilt it to cheat to
 
00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:40.320 align:start position:0%
win to give the republicans a guaranteed
 
00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:43.600 align:start position:0%
victory that is not the case
 
00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:45.440 align:start position:0%
52 is dead
 
00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:47.360 align:start position:0%
your job today is to press a green
 
00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:49.200 align:start position:0%
button or a red button here's the only
 
00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:51.360 align:start position:0%
difference between those two buttons
 
00:20:52.549 --> 00:20:52.559 align:start position:0%
you can
 
00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:54.320 align:start position:0%
press the green button and fulfill your
 
00:20:57.270 --> 00:20:57.280 align:start position:0%
constitutional obligation to redistrict
 
00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:00.320 align:start position:0%
or you can press the red button and this
 
00:21:02.789 --> 00:21:02.799 align:start position:0%

00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:12.320 align:start position:0%

00:33:02.870 --> 00:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
that neither side democrats republicans
 
00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:04.480 align:start position:0%

00:33:06.230 --> 00:33:06.240 align:start position:0%
and we shook hands on it and terry
 
00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:07.840 align:start position:0%
narelly would give us heck for not
 
00:33:09.509 --> 00:33:09.519 align:start position:0%
caucusing but
 
00:33:11.190 --> 00:33:11.200 align:start position:0%

00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:13.440 align:start position:0%
come first one to raise a hand that's
 
00:33:14.950 --> 00:33:14.960 align:start position:0%

and david were such mentors to me
 
00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
and i know if not for the advice and
 
00:33:31.430 --> 00:33:31.440 align:start position:0%
counsel and guidance they gave me
 
00:33:33.669 --> 00:33:33.679 align:start position:0%
as a new member a fairly new member of
 
00:33:36.389 --> 00:33:36.399 align:start position:0%
the house and chairing
 
00:33:39.669 --> 00:33:39.679 align:start position:0%
a committee i never would have ever
 
00:33:42.389 --> 00:33:42.399 align:start position:0%
risen to be a speaker of this body
 
00:33:46.230 --> 00:33:46.240 align:start position:0%
it all started in that 2008 session
 
00:33:48.310 --> 00:33:48.320 align:start position:0%
and with laura it was almost like we
 
00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:51.200 align:start position:0%
were good cop in bad cop
 
00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:53.200 align:start position:0%
i tend to be a little more diplomatic
 
00:33:55.750 --> 00:33:55.760 align:start position:0%
than my good friend from portsmouth
 
00:33:57.350 --> 00:33:57.360 align:start position:0%
and i can remember before we had a
 
00:33:59.269 --> 00:33:59.279 align:start position:0%
committee hearing a criminal justice and
 
00:34:01.110 --> 00:34:01.120 align:start position:0%
there was one person that came before
 
00:34:02.710 --> 00:34:02.720 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
00:34:05.029 --> 00:34:05.039 align:start position:0%
who would represent a
 
00:34:07.509 --> 00:34:07.519 align:start position:0%
contingency and speak on every bill that
 
00:34:10.310 --> 00:34:10.320 align:start position:0%
affected that group that he represented
 
00:34:11.909 --> 00:34:11.919 align:start position:0%
and would go on he's a little bit
 
00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:14.320 align:start position:0%
pompous too to tell you the truth
 
00:34:16.310 --> 00:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
and so he gave this long dissertation
 
00:34:18.149 --> 00:34:18.159 align:start position:0%
why we the committee should do one thing
 
00:34:19.669 --> 00:34:19.679 align:start position:0%
or another
 
00:34:21.669 --> 00:34:21.679 align:start position:0%
and laura said to me i got a question
 
00:34:23.829 --> 00:34:23.839 align:start position:0%
for him i said i recognized laura she
 
00:34:23.839 --> 00:34:24.869 align:start position:0%
for him i said i recognized laura she
says

00:34:24.869 --> 00:34:24.879 align:start position:0%

00:34:26.310 --> 00:34:26.320 align:start position:0%

00:34:30.149 --> 00:34:30.159 align:start position:0%

registered as a lobbyist you hear all
 
00:34:33.829 --> 00:34:33.839 align:start position:0%
that and then she gives the guy in the

pajama just speechless
 
00:34:37.990 --> 00:34:38.000 align:start position:0%

00:34:46.869 --> 00:34:46.879 align:start position:0%

propose that as the elected leaders of

this state it is imperative
 
00:41:55.910 --> 00:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
that we act and act now
 
00:41:58.390 --> 00:41:58.400 align:start position:0%
to curb the flow of blood running
 
00:42:00.790 --> 00:42:00.800 align:start position:0%
towards us
 
00:42:03.430 --> 00:42:03.440 align:start position:0%
it is the purpose and intent
 
00:42:06.390 --> 00:42:06.400 align:start position:0%
of the general court
 
00:42:08.790 --> 00:42:08.800 align:start position:0%
to require commercial firearm sales in
 
00:42:10.870 --> 00:42:10.880 align:start position:0%

00:42:21.430 --> 00:42:21.440 align:start position:0%
i propose that the general court
 
00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
believes this law will protect public
 
00:42:27.430 --> 00:42:27.440 align:start position:0%

65
 
00:42:43.190 --> 00:42:43.200 align:start position:0%
actually it's a little more than 65
 
00:42:46.710 --> 00:42:46.720 align:start position:0%
percent of granite staters support
 
00:42:50.390 --> 00:42:50.400 align:start position:0%
this gun violence prevention measure
 
00:42:53.510 --> 00:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
we must act now
 
00:42:55.510 --> 00:42:55.520 align:start position:0%
we cannot wait
 
00:42:58.390 --> 00:42:58.400 align:start position:0%

00:43:29.750 --> 00:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
the house will be in order it has been

the house will be in order it has been
said

00:43:31.750 --> 00:43:31.760 align:start position:0%
said
 
00:43:33.670 --> 00:43:33.680 align:start position:0%
by people
 
00:43:36.950 --> 00:43:36.960 align:start position:0%
do not let a good tragedy go to waste
 
00:43:39.270 --> 00:43:39.280 align:start position:0%
i suggest to you today
 
00:43:41.829 --> 00:43:41.839 align:start position:0%
that the people of this state have
 
00:43:45.430 --> 00:43:45.440 align:start position:0%
spoken over and over and over
 
00:43:49.190 --> 00:43:49.200 align:start position:0%
on what they want for gun legislation
 
00:43:51.349 --> 00:43:51.359 align:start position:0%
and if we were to
 
00:43:53.430 --> 00:43:53.440 align:start position:0%
move for new legislation the people of
 
00:43:56.150 --> 00:43:56.160 align:start position:0%
the state have a right to be heard in a
 
00:43:57.990 --> 00:43:58.000 align:start position:0%
hearing process
 
00:44:00.230 --> 00:44:00.240 align:start position:0%
they do not want bills snuck in at the
 
00:44:01.829 --> 00:44:01.839 align:start position:0%
last minute
 
00:44:01.839 --> 00:44:03.109 align:start position:0%
last minute
and

00:44:03.109 --> 00:44:03.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:44:04.870 --> 00:44:04.880 align:start position:0%
with no hearing
 
00:44:07.510 --> 00:44:07.520 align:start position:0%
and it's just not going to happen and
 
00:44:10.150 --> 00:44:10.160 align:start position:0%
we're not going to do it we will
 
00:44:12.309 --> 00:44:12.319 align:start position:0%
comply with the hearing process of this
 
00:44:14.470 --> 00:44:14.480 align:start position:0%
house and not
 
00:44:17.430 --> 00:44:17.440 align:start position:0%
force legislation on the people
 
00:44:19.750 --> 00:44:19.760 align:start position:0%
even when we were in the minority and it
 
00:44:22.470 --> 00:44:22.480 align:start position:0%
went to the governor it was vetoed
 
00:44:25.430 --> 00:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
so everybody has spoken on it now next
 
00:44:27.829 --> 00:44:27.839 align:start position:0%
year we're happy to address it again and
 
00:44:29.430 --> 00:44:29.440 align:start position:0%
maybe it'll change
 
00:44:29.440 --> 00:44:30.390 align:start position:0%
maybe it'll change
but

00:44:30.390 --> 00:44:30.400 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:44:32.950 --> 00:44:32.960 align:start position:0%
we will not be throwing aside the
 
00:44:34.829 --> 00:44:34.839 align:start position:0%
process we use to make
 
00:44:37.750 --> 00:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
laws and that is that
 
00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:38.550 align:start position:0%
laws and that is that
this

00:44:38.550 --> 00:44:38.560 align:start position:0%

00:44:40.630 --> 00:44:40.640 align:start position:0%

00:46:44.870 --> 00:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
there have been more mass shootings in

2022
 
00:46:49.190 --> 00:46:49.200 align:start position:0%
than there have been days
 
00:46:51.670 --> 00:46:51.680 align:start position:0%
in the calendar
 
00:46:53.589 --> 00:46:53.599 align:start position:0%
and if i know
 
00:46:54.829 --> 00:46:54.839 align:start position:0%
we are
 
00:46:57.829 --> 00:46:57.839 align:start position:0%
only we are only
 
00:47:01.430 --> 00:47:01.440 align:start position:0%
one of 16 states
 
00:47:02.790 --> 00:47:02.800 align:start position:0%
so far
 
00:47:06.069 --> 00:47:06.079 align:start position:0%
in just the first five months to have
 
00:47:06.079 --> 00:47:06.870 align:start position:0%
in just the first five months to have
not

00:47:06.870 --> 00:47:06.880 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:47:09.990 --> 00:47:10.000 align:start position:0%
experienced a mass shooting and that
 
00:47:12.230 --> 00:47:12.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't make us special
 
00:47:14.550 --> 00:47:14.560 align:start position:0%
nor does it make us house will be in
 
00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:18.630 align:start position:0%
nor does it make us house will be in
order

00:47:18.630 --> 00:47:18.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:21.109 --> 00:47:21.119 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry perhaps i could be a little
 
00:47:26.069 --> 00:47:26.079 align:start position:0%
louder if i know that we are only one of
 
00:47:30.150 --> 00:47:30.160 align:start position:0%
16 states that have not experienced a
 
00:47:35.109 --> 00:47:35.119 align:start position:0%
mass shooting so far in 2022
 
00:47:36.829 --> 00:47:36.839 align:start position:0%
and if i
 
00:47:40.230 --> 00:47:40.240 align:start position:0%
know that stepping over the bodies of
 
00:47:44.790 --> 00:47:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:47.109 --> 00:47:47.119 align:start position:0%
the member will suspend state your point
 
00:47:49.430 --> 00:47:49.440 align:start position:0%
of order
 
00:47:51.349 --> 00:47:51.359 align:start position:0%
mr speaker this is a question to you
 
00:47:52.950 --> 00:47:52.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for hearing me
 
00:47:55.589 --> 00:47:55.599 align:start position:0%
this sounds like a horrible
 
00:47:57.589 --> 00:47:57.599 align:start position:0%
perhaps unintended invitation to
 
00:47:59.589 --> 00:47:59.599 align:start position:0%
disaster in the state of new hampshire
 
00:48:01.510 --> 00:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
and i that's
 
00:48:02.870 --> 00:48:02.880 align:start position:0%
it's a question that's
 
00:48:04.870 --> 00:48:04.880 align:start position:0%
that's that's not a that's not a point
 
00:48:08.150 --> 00:48:08.160 align:start position:0%
of order well i'm my point of order
 
00:48:09.910 --> 00:48:09.920 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:48:11.990 --> 00:48:12.000 align:start position:0%
under these circumstances
 
00:48:13.270 --> 00:48:13.280 align:start position:0%
can a
 
00:48:15.990 --> 00:48:16.000 align:start position:0%
speaker's speech be suspended
 
00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:18.150 align:start position:0%

00:48:20.230 --> 00:48:20.240 align:start position:0%
the member is delivering a parliamentary
 
00:48:20.240 --> 00:48:21.000 align:start position:0%
the member is delivering a parliamentary

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:21.010 align:start position:0%

and she is i'm sure she is going to wrap
 
00:48:26.790 --> 00:48:26.800 align:start position:0%
up very soon
 
00:48:29.030 --> 00:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
thank you very much

00:48:43.270 --> 00:48:43.280 align:start position:0%
i'll repeat my last two phrases and i
 
00:48:46.549 --> 00:48:46.559 align:start position:0%
will wrap up no i was talked over if i
 
00:48:50.870 --> 00:48:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:52.630 --> 00:48:52.640 align:start position:0%
this is a parliamentary inquiry not a
 
00:48:55.190 --> 00:48:55.200 align:start position:0%
speech if i know
 
00:48:58.069 --> 00:48:58.079 align:start position:0%
that stepping over the bodies of dead
 
00:49:01.030 --> 00:49:01.040 align:start position:0%
children is an unacceptable way
 
00:49:02.549 --> 00:49:02.559 align:start position:0%
to live
 
00:49:04.549 --> 00:49:04.559 align:start position:0%
and if i know
 
00:49:06.870 --> 00:49:06.880 align:start position:0%
the house will be in order
 
00:49:10.069 --> 00:49:10.079 align:start position:0%
finally if i know
 
00:49:14.069 --> 00:49:14.079 align:start position:0%
that we can do hard things
 
00:49:19.349 --> 00:49:19.359 align:start position:0%
and we can make a change so that we
 
00:49:23.430 --> 00:49:23.440 align:start position:0%
don't have to live like this will i now
 
00:49:27.190 --> 00:49:27.200 align:start position:0%

accurately predicted at the start of
 
01:15:48.070 --> 01:15:48.080 align:start position:0%
their life
 
01:15:49.750 --> 01:15:49.760 align:start position:0%
a family that may start out looking
 
01:15:51.910 --> 01:15:51.920 align:start position:0%
stable on the outside may later need
 
01:15:53.669 --> 01:15:53.679 align:start position:0%
assistance being able to care for their
 
01:15:55.669 --> 01:15:55.679 align:start position:0%
children and that may include foster
 
01:15:57.590 --> 01:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
care of some kind
 
01:15:59.910 --> 01:15:59.920 align:start position:0%
until we can eliminate the factors that
 
01:16:02.070 --> 01:16:02.080 align:start position:0%
go into parents being able
 
01:16:03.669 --> 01:16:03.679 align:start position:0%
to best care for their children the
 
01:16:05.430 --> 01:16:05.440 align:start position:0%
foster care system is here to stay
 
01:16:07.189 --> 01:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
despite all the strong emotions that
 
01:16:08.950 --> 01:16:08.960 align:start position:0%
come up where whenever we hear of the
 
01:16:10.950 --> 01:16:10.960 align:start position:0%
mischie treatment of children within the
 
01:16:10.960 --> 01:16:13.270 align:start position:0%
mischie treatment of children within the
system

01:16:13.270 --> 01:16:13.280 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:16:15.189 --> 01:16:15.199 align:start position:0%
we have to get this right
 
01:16:17.189 --> 01:16:17.199 align:start position:0%
we invest so much in our children both
 
01:16:19.590 --> 01:16:19.600 align:start position:0%
personally and as a society in funding
 
01:16:22.070 --> 01:16:22.080 align:start position:0%
their education and well-being that it's
 
01:16:25.750 --> 01:16:25.760 align:start position:0%
bad fiscal sense to give up on any child
 
01:16:27.830 --> 01:16:27.840 align:start position:0%
i once had dinner with the swiss
 
01:16:29.590 --> 01:16:29.600 align:start position:0%
ambassador to the united states and we
 
01:16:31.990 --> 01:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
discussed one of my favorite topics
 
01:16:34.390 --> 01:16:34.400 align:start position:0%
vocational education in switzerland
 
01:16:36.470 --> 01:16:36.480 align:start position:0%
versus vocational education in the
 
01:16:38.790 --> 01:16:38.800 align:start position:0%
united states and societal attitudes
 
01:16:41.910 --> 01:16:41.920 align:start position:0%
surrounding all aspects of it yes
 
01:16:43.270 --> 01:16:43.280 align:start position:0%
i happened to read a book about it
 
01:16:45.430 --> 01:16:45.440 align:start position:0%
before i happened to meet him
 
01:16:47.510 --> 01:16:47.520 align:start position:0%
he told me that since they do not have
 
01:16:49.910 --> 01:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
any natural resources you know except
 
01:16:51.510 --> 01:16:51.520 align:start position:0%
for tourism
 
01:16:53.510 --> 01:16:53.520 align:start position:0%
to speak of they consider their children
 
01:16:55.189 --> 01:16:55.199 align:start position:0%
to be their most precious natural
 
01:16:57.510 --> 01:16:57.520 align:start position:0%
resource and that has always resonated
 
01:16:59.669 --> 01:16:59.679 align:start position:0%
with me
 
01:17:01.750 --> 01:17:01.760 align:start position:0%
we cannot risk throwing people away or
 
01:17:03.669 --> 01:17:03.679 align:start position:0%
having them feel thrown away and
 
01:17:03.679 --> 01:17:04.870 align:start position:0%
having them feel thrown away and
unwanted

01:17:04.870 --> 01:17:04.880 align:start position:0%
unwanted
 
01:17:07.270 --> 01:17:07.280 align:start position:0%
a child a child's worth and value is not
 
01:17:09.350 --> 01:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
and should not be dependent upon a few
 
01:17:11.590 --> 01:17:11.600 align:start position:0%
people who are able or unwilling to care
 
01:17:13.669 --> 01:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
for them or who simply don't want them
 
01:17:16.390 --> 01:17:16.400 align:start position:0%
whether they are related by blood or not
 
01:17:18.310 --> 01:17:18.320 align:start position:0%
when children feel unvalued rejected and
 
01:17:19.990 --> 01:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
thrown away this creates dysfunction
 
01:17:22.229 --> 01:17:22.239 align:start position:0%
that reverberates all over our society
 
01:17:24.870 --> 01:17:24.880 align:start position:0%
and into the next generations it's not
 
01:17:26.950 --> 01:17:26.960 align:start position:0%
just unhealthy it's a sort of
 
01:17:30.390 --> 01:17:30.400 align:start position:0%
slow-motion societal suicide we simply
 
01:17:33.110 --> 01:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
cannot afford to treat people this way
 
01:17:34.950 --> 01:17:34.960 align:start position:0%
there are many wonderful foster parents
 
01:17:36.630 --> 01:17:36.640 align:start position:0%
and they are worthy of our utmost praise
 
01:17:38.870 --> 01:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
and respect and i thank you to all who
 
01:17:41.110 --> 01:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
have become foster and adoptive parents
 
01:17:43.430 --> 01:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
for all the right reasons i've met you
 
01:17:45.350 --> 01:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
and some of you are with us in this
 
01:17:49.070 --> 01:17:49.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:49.080 --> 01:17:50.310 align:start position:0%
 
[Applause]

01:17:50.310 --> 01:17:50.320 align:start position:0%
[Applause]
 
01:17:53.510 --> 01:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
i have i have more but we also have time
 
01:17:54.870 --> 01:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
since we're waiting for the senate under
 
01:17:57.030 --> 01:17:57.040 align:start position:0%
the best of circumstances foster care is
 
01:17:59.350 --> 01:17:59.360 align:start position:0%
a sort of culture shock it takes
 
01:18:01.350 --> 01:18:01.360 align:start position:0%
adjustment that can be hard
 
01:18:02.870 --> 01:18:02.880 align:start position:0%
when they're already when there is
 
01:18:05.110 --> 01:18:05.120 align:start position:0%
already a lot of baggage
 
01:18:07.110 --> 01:18:07.120 align:start position:0%
to bring to the new home so to speak
 
01:18:08.870 --> 01:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
when foster care doesn't work out for a
 
01:18:11.189 --> 01:18:11.199 align:start position:0%
child if they feel unwanted or if they
 
01:18:12.870 --> 01:18:12.880 align:start position:0%
feel the providers are not in it for the
 
01:18:16.070 --> 01:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
right reasons it's the end of the line
 
01:18:18.390 --> 01:18:18.400 align:start position:0%
where do you go after that trust is gone
 
01:18:23.990 --> 01:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:26.390 --> 01:18:26.400 align:start position:0%
you feel like all hope is gone
 
01:18:28.149 --> 01:18:28.159 align:start position:0%
my social workers
 
01:18:30.149 --> 01:18:30.159 align:start position:0%
looked for a placement for me for months
 
01:18:31.510 --> 01:18:31.520 align:start position:0%
and months but few people wanted
 
01:18:34.070 --> 01:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
teenagers teenagers have baggage and i
 
01:18:35.750 --> 01:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
didn't have much at the time literally
 
01:18:38.550 --> 01:18:38.560 align:start position:0%
and figuratively just one black trash
 
01:18:42.070 --> 01:18:42.080 align:start position:0%
trash bag as an aside a friend suggested
 
01:18:44.310 --> 01:18:44.320 align:start position:0%
that since we are unaware of any flag
 
01:18:47.510 --> 01:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
that is used for foster care awareness
 
01:18:50.070 --> 01:18:50.080 align:start position:0%
that a trash bag be used
 
01:18:50.080 --> 01:18:51.189 align:start position:0%
that a trash bag be used
ouch

01:18:51.189 --> 01:18:51.199 align:start position:0%
ouch
 
01:18:53.590 --> 01:18:53.600 align:start position:0%
but it makes the point
 
01:18:55.350 --> 01:18:55.360 align:start position:0%
all these years later i'm still feeling
 
01:18:57.750 --> 01:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
pretty bad about this and maybe i may be
 
01:19:00.630 --> 01:19:00.640 align:start position:0%
a big important state representative now
 
01:19:01.990 --> 01:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
which is a little bit of a joke because
 
01:19:04.310 --> 01:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
you know but this perceived earlier
 
01:19:06.630 --> 01:19:06.640 align:start position:0%
rejection by my entire community lingers
 
01:19:08.149 --> 01:19:08.159 align:start position:0%
and i know my life would be different
 
01:19:10.070 --> 01:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
now had i had more confidence in myself
 
01:19:11.270 --> 01:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
early on
 
01:19:13.030 --> 01:19:13.040 align:start position:0%
i'm sure someone would have wanted me if
 
01:19:14.470 --> 01:19:14.480 align:start position:0%
they knew me and if they knew i was a
 
01:19:16.390 --> 01:19:16.400 align:start position:0%
nice kid if they knew i had never been
 
01:19:17.910 --> 01:19:17.920 align:start position:0%
in trouble with the police that my
 
01:19:19.910 --> 01:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
teachers liked me and
 
01:19:22.390 --> 01:19:22.400 align:start position:0%
but none of that mattered at all
 
01:19:23.669 --> 01:19:23.679 align:start position:0%
it felt like none of that mattered
 
01:19:25.669 --> 01:19:25.679 align:start position:0%
because before the world saw me as any
 
01:19:27.430 --> 01:19:27.440 align:start position:0%
of those good things they saw me as a
 
01:19:27.440 --> 01:19:30.070 align:start position:0%
of those good things they saw me as a
kid

01:19:30.070 --> 01:19:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:32.390 --> 01:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
as a kid from a family with with
 
01:19:34.709 --> 01:19:34.719 align:start position:0%
problems and an at-risk kid
 
01:19:36.709 --> 01:19:36.719 align:start position:0%
and i'll be honest with you there was
 
01:19:38.470 --> 01:19:38.480 align:start position:0%
rage and there was anger and there was
 
01:19:40.229 --> 01:19:40.239 align:start position:0%
extreme jealousy of the other kids who
 
01:19:42.310 --> 01:19:42.320 align:start position:0%
were simply born and to people who
 
01:19:44.550 --> 01:19:44.560 align:start position:0%
wanted them and could care for them
 
01:19:47.350 --> 01:19:47.360 align:start position:0%
or who chose them
 
01:19:48.790 --> 01:19:48.800 align:start position:0%
i wish i could tell you i found a safe
 
01:19:51.030 --> 01:19:51.040 align:start position:0%
foster care placement but i never did i
 
01:19:52.630 --> 01:19:52.640 align:start position:0%
had wonderful social workers who were
 
01:19:54.390 --> 01:19:54.400 align:start position:0%
very kind and professional and they did
 
01:19:56.790 --> 01:19:56.800 align:start position:0%
their best in impossible circumstances
 
01:19:59.590 --> 01:19:59.600 align:start position:0%
and for that i am forever grateful
 
01:20:01.910 --> 01:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
placement i had was not safe and i went
 
01:20:04.390 --> 01:20:04.400 align:start position:0%
from one nightmare to another and i had
 
01:20:06.550 --> 01:20:06.560 align:start position:0%
to play a lot of insane games to have a
 
01:20:08.229 --> 01:20:08.239 align:start position:0%
safe place to live and i was never
 
01:20:09.910 --> 01:20:09.920 align:start position:0%
really safe but i had a door that i
 
01:20:11.750 --> 01:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
could barricade at night and that was as
 
01:20:13.590 --> 01:20:13.600 align:start position:0%
good as it was going to get
 
01:20:15.590 --> 01:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
at age 13 i saw that my whole life was
 
01:20:17.270 --> 01:20:17.280 align:start position:0%
precarious so i signed up to attend
 
01:20:18.709 --> 01:20:18.719 align:start position:0%
vocational high school and learn to
 
01:20:20.070 --> 01:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
trade so i can start taking care of
 
01:20:22.149 --> 01:20:22.159 align:start position:0%
myself as soon as possible i am still in
 
01:20:24.149 --> 01:20:24.159 align:start position:0%
awe of how practical that was for a 13
 
01:20:25.830 --> 01:20:25.840 align:start position:0%
year old to do
 
01:20:27.510 --> 01:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
rents were very high labor laws
 
01:20:29.430 --> 01:20:29.440 align:start position:0%
prevented me from working enough hours
 
01:20:30.629 --> 01:20:30.639 align:start position:0%
running machines that i had already
 
01:20:32.149 --> 01:20:32.159 align:start position:0%
learned how to operate at school to pay
 
01:20:33.910 --> 01:20:33.920 align:start position:0%
the rent so that plan never worked out
 
01:20:35.110 --> 01:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
for me
 
01:20:37.030 --> 01:20:37.040 align:start position:0%
the state i then lived in protected me
 
01:20:39.270 --> 01:20:39.280 align:start position:0%
so much on one facet of life and not at
 
01:20:40.870 --> 01:20:40.880 align:start position:0%
all on another more important one of
 
01:20:43.110 --> 01:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
helping me find a safe place to live
 
01:20:44.629 --> 01:20:44.639 align:start position:0%
to say i felt thrown away is an
 
01:20:44.639 --> 01:20:46.550 align:start position:0%
to say i felt thrown away is an
understatement

01:20:46.550 --> 01:20:46.560 align:start position:0%
understatement
 
01:20:48.629 --> 01:20:48.639 align:start position:0%
it gets worse if i had gone to live on
 
01:20:50.229 --> 01:20:50.239 align:start position:0%
the streets or under a bridge and i did
 
01:20:52.550 --> 01:20:52.560 align:start position:0%
have a bridge i was considering i would
 
01:20:53.990 --> 01:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
have been at very high risk for being
 
01:20:55.590 --> 01:20:55.600 align:start position:0%
trafficked sexually
 
01:20:57.350 --> 01:20:57.360 align:start position:0%
looking back there were people that
 
01:21:00.070 --> 01:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
tried that scam on me
 
01:21:02.470 --> 01:21:02.480 align:start position:0%
and i told them to do anatomically
 
01:21:08.629 --> 01:21:08.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:11.110 --> 01:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
a 2014 department of justice report
 
01:21:12.950 --> 01:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
estimated that 85 percent of girls
 
01:21:14.390 --> 01:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
involved in sex trafficking were
 
01:21:16.310 --> 01:21:16.320 align:start position:0%
previously involved in the child welfare
 
01:21:16.320 --> 01:21:17.990 align:start position:0%
previously involved in the child welfare
system

01:21:17.990 --> 01:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:21:19.669 --> 01:21:19.679 align:start position:0%
eighty-five percent
 
01:21:21.510 --> 01:21:21.520 align:start position:0%
the other terrible outcomes are measured
 
01:21:23.910 --> 01:21:23.920 align:start position:0%
in huge drawdown dropping
 
01:21:25.590 --> 01:21:25.600 align:start position:0%
dropping percentages
 
01:21:27.350 --> 01:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
half of former foster youth are involved
 
01:21:29.189 --> 01:21:29.199 align:start position:0%
in the criminal justice system about
 
01:21:31.110 --> 01:21:31.120 align:start position:0%
that same percentage graduate from high
 
01:21:33.750 --> 01:21:33.760 align:start position:0%
school that number increases to 75

percent will not graduate from high
 
01:21:37.510 --> 01:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
school if they age out of the foster
 
01:21:39.590 --> 01:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
care system age out means that they stay
 
01:21:41.590 --> 01:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
in the foster care system until age 18
 
01:21:44.310 --> 01:21:44.320 align:start position:0%
or when their state services end
 
01:21:46.229 --> 01:21:46.239 align:start position:0%
former foster youth are seven times more
 
01:21:49.110 --> 01:21:49.120 align:start position:0%
likely to experience drug dependency
 
01:21:50.870 --> 01:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
fifty percent of homeless people have
 
01:21:53.750 --> 01:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
spent time in foster care only between
 
01:21:55.510 --> 01:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
three and ten percent of former foster
 
01:21:57.669 --> 01:21:57.679 align:start position:0%
youth ever graduate from college i got
 
01:22:00.790 --> 01:22:00.800 align:start position:0%
my degree in 2014.
 
01:22:02.629 --> 01:22:02.639 align:start position:0%
i don't know what the suicide rates are
 
01:22:04.790 --> 01:22:04.800 align:start position:0%
for former foster youth but i think that
 
01:22:06.390 --> 01:22:06.400 align:start position:0%
they are hard to determine with so many
 
01:22:08.149 --> 01:22:08.159 align:start position:0%
other factors like drug dependency and
 
01:22:09.830 --> 01:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
the abuse and neglect that first brings
 
01:22:12.310 --> 01:22:12.320 align:start position:0%
them into the system
 
01:22:13.750 --> 01:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
i still get very sad when i think of
 
01:22:15.910 --> 01:22:15.920 align:start position:0%
parts of my childhood and the sadness
 
01:22:17.910 --> 01:22:17.920 align:start position:0%
can be life-threatening for people and i
 
01:22:20.070 --> 01:22:20.080 align:start position:0%
will be brutally honest with you here
 
01:22:21.830 --> 01:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
i consider it like a sort of cancer that
 
01:22:25.830 --> 01:22:25.840 align:start position:0%
i might i must fight on an ongoing basis
 
01:22:27.590 --> 01:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
i have people in my life who love me and
 
01:22:29.189 --> 01:22:29.199 align:start position:0%
they tell me i'm special i found one of
 
01:22:31.350 --> 01:22:31.360 align:start position:0%
my old social workers he runs a home for
 
01:22:34.870 --> 01:22:34.880 align:start position:0%
at-risk teens in this state
 
01:22:36.550 --> 01:22:36.560 align:start position:0%
and he told me that i was his success
 
01:22:39.350 --> 01:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
story now i refuse to believe that
 
01:22:41.270 --> 01:22:41.280 align:start position:0%
and i reject that
 
01:22:43.189 --> 01:22:43.199 align:start position:0%
and i reject that i'm special and i
 
01:22:45.110 --> 01:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
reject that because i will not be his
 
01:22:47.110 --> 01:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
only success story
 
01:22:48.790 --> 01:22:48.800 align:start position:0%
i want other kids in foster care today
 
01:22:50.149 --> 01:22:50.159 align:start position:0%
to know that they are going to do this
 
01:22:51.910 --> 01:22:51.920 align:start position:0%
too and that they will be okay and that
 
01:22:53.430 --> 01:22:53.440 align:start position:0%
they will be success stories and they
 
01:22:55.830 --> 01:22:55.840 align:start position:0%
will grow up to have people who see them
 
01:22:57.350 --> 01:22:57.360 align:start position:0%
for who they are and the value they
 
01:22:59.590 --> 01:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
bring to the world i have a right to
 
01:22:59.600 --> 01:23:01.510 align:start position:0%
bring to the world i have a right to
exist

01:23:01.510 --> 01:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
exist
 
01:23:04.229 --> 01:23:04.239 align:start position:0%
i have paid taxes for many decades and i
 
01:23:07.350 --> 01:23:07.360 align:start position:0%
have far surpassed what was spent on me
 
01:23:09.350 --> 01:23:09.360 align:start position:0%
i didn't abuse other people i didn't
 
01:23:10.870 --> 01:23:10.880 align:start position:0%
commit any crimes i didn't do anything
 
01:23:12.950 --> 01:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
horrible in my life my friends who also
 
01:23:14.550 --> 01:23:14.560 align:start position:0%
spent time in foster care are amazing
 
01:23:17.830 --> 01:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:19.189 --> 01:23:19.199 align:start position:0%
i worked a job making some of the
 
01:23:20.550 --> 01:23:20.560 align:start position:0%
world's most beautiful musical
 
01:23:22.149 --> 01:23:22.159 align:start position:0%
instruments and i raised two wonderful
 
01:23:23.590 --> 01:23:23.600 align:start position:0%
children who are also valuable
 
01:23:25.990 --> 01:23:26.000 align:start position:0%
contributing members to society but even
 
01:23:27.990 --> 01:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
if i didn't do those things i still have
 
01:23:29.510 --> 01:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
a right to exist and i have a right to
 
01:23:29.520 --> 01:23:30.629 align:start position:0%
a right to exist and i have a right to
life

01:23:30.629 --> 01:23:30.639 align:start position:0%
life
 
01:23:32.470 --> 01:23:32.480 align:start position:0%
there has been a recent reignition of a
 
01:23:33.910 --> 01:23:33.920 align:start position:0%
debate that i feel i should say
 
01:23:35.750 --> 01:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
something about as it pertains to this
 
01:23:35.760 --> 01:23:37.350 align:start position:0%
something about as it pertains to this
issue

01:23:37.350 --> 01:23:37.360 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:23:38.790 --> 01:23:38.800 align:start position:0%
the conditions that bring children into
 
01:23:41.590 --> 01:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
foster care cannot be solved by abortion
 
01:23:43.590 --> 01:23:43.600 align:start position:0%
because if they could have been foster
 
01:23:45.669 --> 01:23:45.679 align:start position:0%
care would have gone away in 1973 please
 
01:23:47.110 --> 01:23:47.120 align:start position:0%
don't assume that we are only
 
01:23:49.590 --> 01:23:49.600 align:start position:0%
experiencing the muted the member will
 
01:23:51.750 --> 01:23:51.760 align:start position:0%
suspend for what reason does the member
 
01:23:51.760 --> 01:24:02.229 align:start position:0%
suspend for what reason does the member
rise

01:24:02.229 --> 01:24:02.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:06.070 --> 01:24:06.080 align:start position:0%
thank you may continue thank you
 
01:24:07.510 --> 01:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
please don't assume we are only
 
01:24:09.510 --> 01:24:09.520 align:start position:0%
experiencing the muted effects of social
 
01:24:10.950 --> 01:24:10.960 align:start position:0%
problems that would have been worsened
 
01:24:12.550 --> 01:24:12.560 align:start position:0%
by fewer abortions i believe it's
 
01:24:14.310 --> 01:24:14.320 align:start position:0%
respect and value
 
01:24:15.830 --> 01:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
for individual lives that are the
 
01:24:17.510 --> 01:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
foundation for how we overcome the
 
01:24:19.430 --> 01:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
problems that lead to child neglect
 
01:24:20.950 --> 01:24:20.960 align:start position:0%
child abuse and substance abuse that
 
01:24:22.629 --> 01:24:22.639 align:start position:0%
brings so many children into the foster
 
01:24:25.669 --> 01:24:25.679 align:start position:0%
care system in the first place
 
01:24:27.510 --> 01:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
i've had otherwise well-meaning people
 
01:24:29.110 --> 01:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
tell me i should never have been born
 
01:24:31.430 --> 01:24:31.440 align:start position:0%
because of the struggles i endured right
 
01:24:33.270 --> 01:24:33.280 align:start position:0%
in front of me they argue that if it
 
01:24:35.110 --> 01:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
seems like a child may one day be in
 
01:24:36.790 --> 01:24:36.800 align:start position:0%
foster care that the child should be
 
01:24:38.709 --> 01:24:38.719 align:start position:0%
aborted instead and society will be
 
01:24:40.390 --> 01:24:40.400 align:start position:0%
better for it
 
01:24:42.790 --> 01:24:42.800 align:start position:0%
can you imagine saying such things to
 
01:24:44.709 --> 01:24:44.719 align:start position:0%
someone struggling because of their race
 
01:24:46.790 --> 01:24:46.800 align:start position:0%
or ethnic background or a developmental
 
01:24:48.790 --> 01:24:48.800 align:start position:0%
delay or other unchangeable factor of
 
01:24:50.070 --> 01:24:50.080 align:start position:0%
who they are
 
01:24:51.430 --> 01:24:51.440 align:start position:0%
what if they belong to a group that
 
01:24:53.270 --> 01:24:53.280 align:start position:0%
tends to have a higher than average
 
01:24:56.390 --> 01:24:56.400 align:start position:0%
incarceration rates
 
01:24:58.470 --> 01:24:58.480 align:start position:0%
than other groups do we ever argue that
 
01:24:59.990 --> 01:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
they should never never have been born
 
01:25:00.950 --> 01:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
at all
 
01:25:00.960 --> 01:25:03.430 align:start position:0%
at all
no

01:25:03.430 --> 01:25:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:05.189 --> 01:25:05.199 align:start position:0%
because we rightly grant them a higher
 
01:25:07.030 --> 01:25:07.040 align:start position:0%
level of respect than to ever say that
 
01:25:08.390 --> 01:25:08.400 align:start position:0%
they should not have been born for those
 
01:25:08.400 --> 01:25:09.350 align:start position:0%
they should not have been born for those
reasons

01:25:09.350 --> 01:25:09.360 align:start position:0%
reasons
 
01:25:11.350 --> 01:25:11.360 align:start position:0%
i ask that we please grant the same
 
01:25:14.149 --> 01:25:14.159 align:start position:0%
kindness and respect to future possible
 
01:25:16.229 --> 01:25:16.239 align:start position:0%
foster youth as well so instead of
 
01:25:17.669 --> 01:25:17.679 align:start position:0%
saying the world would be better off
 
01:25:19.669 --> 01:25:19.679 align:start position:0%
without them let's work together to more
 
01:25:21.990 --> 01:25:22.000 align:start position:0%
explicitly appreciate their inherent
 
01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:23.510 align:start position:0%
explicitly appreciate their inherent
humanity

01:25:23.510 --> 01:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
humanity
 
01:25:25.030 --> 01:25:25.040 align:start position:0%
and value them and make the world a
 
01:25:26.709 --> 01:25:26.719 align:start position:0%
better place for all of them in ways
 
01:25:29.189 --> 01:25:29.199 align:start position:0%
that and all the ways that we can thank
 
01:25:30.790 --> 01:25:30.800 align:start position:0%

01:25:44.470 --> 01:25:44.480 align:start position:0%

for me to highlight this important

01:32:56.950 --> 01:32:56.960 align:start position:0%
holiday
 
01:32:59.189 --> 01:32:59.199 align:start position:0%
this holiday isn't significant just to
 
01:33:01.430 --> 01:33:01.440 align:start position:0%
quebec in the future independent nation
 
01:33:02.629 --> 01:33:02.639 align:start position:0%
of quebec
 
01:33:05.189 --> 01:33:05.199 align:start position:0%
but for quebecers around the world
 
01:33:07.270 --> 01:33:07.280 align:start position:0%
in which we celebrate our unique culture
 
01:33:08.470 --> 01:33:08.480 align:start position:0%
in history
 
01:33:11.830 --> 01:33:11.840 align:start position:0%
our fourth of july you could say
 
01:33:13.350 --> 01:33:13.360 align:start position:0%
the people
 
01:33:15.350 --> 01:33:15.360 align:start position:0%
of quebec have a unique history marked
 
01:33:17.990 --> 01:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
of oppression by great britain and the
 
01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:19.750 align:start position:0%
of oppression by great britain and the
anglophones

01:33:19.750 --> 01:33:19.760 align:start position:0%
anglophones
 
01:33:22.470 --> 01:33:22.480 align:start position:0%
this history as we know started in 1763
 
01:33:25.350 --> 01:33:25.360 align:start position:0%
when great britain conquered new france
 
01:33:27.030 --> 01:33:27.040 align:start position:0%
since then the anglophones have always
 
01:33:29.510 --> 01:33:29.520 align:start position:0%
dominated the people of quebec
 
01:33:31.510 --> 01:33:31.520 align:start position:0%
the anglophones controlled the economy
 
01:33:33.110 --> 01:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
in all managerial and leadership
 
01:33:35.510 --> 01:33:35.520 align:start position:0%
positions and enterprises
 
01:33:36.950 --> 01:33:36.960 align:start position:0%
and treated their french-speaking
 
01:33:40.310 --> 01:33:40.320 align:start position:0%
employees as second-class citizens
 
01:33:42.870 --> 01:33:42.880 align:start position:0%
the anglophones never wanted to let
 
01:33:45.430 --> 01:33:45.440 align:start position:0%
quebecers have self-determination
 
01:33:47.990 --> 01:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
and control their own destiny
 
01:33:50.550 --> 01:33:50.560 align:start position:0%
a perfect example of this is the october
 
01:33:52.870 --> 01:33:52.880 align:start position:0%
crisis of 1970
 
01:33:54.390 --> 01:33:54.400 align:start position:0%
when the canadian fellow federal
 
01:33:56.790 --> 01:33:56.800 align:start position:0%
government of prime minister pierre
 
01:33:58.149 --> 01:33:58.159 align:start position:0%
elliot trudeau
 
01:34:01.189 --> 01:34:01.199 align:start position:0%
used the war measures act
 
01:34:03.510 --> 01:34:03.520 align:start position:0%
to declare martial law in quebec and to
 
01:34:06.470 --> 01:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
occupy the territory of quebec
 
01:34:09.510 --> 01:34:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:11.110 --> 01:34:11.120 align:start position:0%
the federal government used this power
 
01:34:14.310 --> 01:34:14.320 align:start position:0%
to arrest and detain without warrant or
 
01:34:15.750 --> 01:34:15.760 align:start position:0%
any charges
 
01:34:18.629 --> 01:34:18.639 align:start position:0%
journalists activists actors singers and
 
01:34:20.950 --> 01:34:20.960 align:start position:0%
intellectuals who supported the movement
 
01:34:24.229 --> 01:34:24.239 align:start position:0%
for independence of quebec
 
01:34:25.709 --> 01:34:25.719 align:start position:0%
in total
 
01:34:28.390 --> 01:34:28.400 align:start position:0%
497 people were arrested
 
01:34:30.790 --> 01:34:30.800 align:start position:0%
many of them for weeks and even months
 
01:34:33.430 --> 01:34:33.440 align:start position:0%
without cause and over three thousand
 
01:34:35.110 --> 01:34:35.120 align:start position:0%
warrantless searches and seizures of
 
01:34:37.270 --> 01:34:37.280 align:start position:0%
homes occurred
 
01:34:39.270 --> 01:34:39.280 align:start position:0%
even after the october crisis and the
 
01:34:41.430 --> 01:34:41.440 align:start position:0%
rescinding of the war powers act
 
01:34:42.950 --> 01:34:42.960 align:start position:0%
the federal government continued to
 
01:34:45.270 --> 01:34:45.280 align:start position:0%
illegally spy on pro-independence
 
01:34:45.280 --> 01:34:47.990 align:start position:0%
illegally spy on pro-independence
activists

01:34:47.990 --> 01:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:51.590 --> 01:34:51.600 align:start position:0%
a few a few years later in 1995 quebec
 
01:34:54.070 --> 01:34:54.080 align:start position:0%
voted on a referendum from india for
 
01:34:55.990 --> 01:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
independence from canada
 
01:34:57.709 --> 01:34:57.719 align:start position:0%
the final result
 
01:35:01.990 --> 01:35:02.000 align:start position:0%
50.58 percent against and 49.42
 
01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:03.510 align:start position:0%
50.58 percent against and 49.42
opposed

01:35:03.510 --> 01:35:03.520 align:start position:0%
opposed
 
01:35:05.590 --> 01:35:05.600 align:start position:0%
with a total difference of around only
 
01:35:10.629 --> 01:35:10.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:12.470 --> 01:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
sadly though the federal government
 
01:35:14.229 --> 01:35:14.239 align:start position:0%
illegally interfered in this referendum
 
01:35:16.229 --> 01:35:16.239 align:start position:0%
as well
 
01:35:18.629 --> 01:35:18.639 align:start position:0%
first they illegally funded the no side
 
01:35:20.149 --> 01:35:20.159 align:start position:0%
of the referendum to a sum of four
 
01:35:22.950 --> 01:35:22.960 align:start position:0%
million dollars against both quebec and
 
01:35:24.870 --> 01:35:24.880 align:start position:0%
federal law
 
01:35:26.550 --> 01:35:26.560 align:start position:0%
secondly months leading up to the
 
01:35:28.229 --> 01:35:28.239 align:start position:0%
referendum the federal government sent
 
01:35:30.229 --> 01:35:30.239 align:start position:0%
immigration judges from across the
 
01:35:31.910 --> 01:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
country to quebec
 
01:35:34.950 --> 01:35:34.960 align:start position:0%
to accelerate the naturalization process
 
01:35:36.550 --> 01:35:36.560 align:start position:0%
and give many the right to vote in that
 
01:35:36.560 --> 01:35:38.790 align:start position:0%
and give many the right to vote in that
referendum

01:35:38.790 --> 01:35:38.800 align:start position:0%

01:35:41.109 --> 01:35:41.119 align:start position:0%
in total 43 000 individuals received

citizenship in the months prior to the
 
01:35:46.149 --> 01:35:46.159 align:start position:0%
referendum with a quarter occurring in
 
01:35:49.510 --> 01:35:49.520 align:start position:0%

01:35:52.950 --> 01:35:52.960 align:start position:0%

01:35:55.189 --> 01:35:55.199 align:start position:0%
when i say that i mean the true
 
01:35:57.910 --> 01:35:57.920 align:start position:0%
french-speaking and ethnic quebecers
 
01:35:59.669 --> 01:35:59.679 align:start position:0%

thank you mr speaker i guess i really
 
03:26:46.870 --> 03:26:46.880 align:start position:0%

03:26:48.389 --> 03:26:48.399 align:start position:0%
rise in support
 
03:26:50.229 --> 03:26:50.239 align:start position:0%
of the committee of conference
 
03:26:53.750 --> 03:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
recommendation on house bill 1431.
 
03:26:56.469 --> 03:26:56.479 align:start position:0%
the republican platform simply says on
 
03:26:59.110 --> 03:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
education to promote education freedom
 
03:27:00.870 --> 03:27:00.880 align:start position:0%
and parental rights to control the
 
03:27:02.870 --> 03:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
education of their children
 
03:27:04.550 --> 03:27:04.560 align:start position:0%
but the republican party is not the only
 
03:27:05.910 --> 03:27:05.920 align:start position:0%
one that says that so does the
 
03:27:08.469 --> 03:27:08.479 align:start position:0%
constitution party so does the
 
03:27:10.469 --> 03:27:10.479 align:start position:0%
uh reform party in the green party and
 
03:27:12.150 --> 03:27:12.160 align:start position:0%
almost all the independent political
 
03:27:13.990 --> 03:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
parties and political movements in
 
03:27:15.750 --> 03:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
groups that are formed out of grassroots
 
03:27:17.990 --> 03:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
ordinary people around the country they
 
03:27:19.429 --> 03:27:19.439 align:start position:0%
have all supported
 
03:27:20.790 --> 03:27:20.800 align:start position:0%
parental rights
 
03:27:23.349 --> 03:27:23.359 align:start position:0%
and to very extense parental
 
03:27:25.830 --> 03:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
notification this bill in my opinion is
 
03:27:27.590 --> 03:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
simply a parental notification that if
 
03:27:29.590 --> 03:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
something is going on in the schools if
 
03:27:34.710 --> 03:27:34.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:36.950 --> 03:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
admission with with with other students
 
03:27:38.389 --> 03:27:38.399 align:start position:0%
and if there's any official activity
 
03:27:39.830 --> 03:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
involving the school district and its
 
03:27:42.389 --> 03:27:42.399 align:start position:0%
employees that they that
 
03:27:44.790 --> 03:27:44.800 align:start position:0%
the parents simply be notified
 
03:27:47.510 --> 03:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
so i absolutely not only support this
 
03:27:49.429 --> 03:27:49.439 align:start position:0%
bill i think that that this is one of
 
03:27:51.830 --> 03:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
the most important sorry this is one of
 
03:27:53.830 --> 03:27:53.840 align:start position:0%
the most important bills that we take on
 
03:27:56.229 --> 03:27:56.239 align:start position:0%
this session i've said for years to my
 
03:27:58.950 --> 03:27:58.960 align:start position:0%
constituents when i ran that i believe
 
03:28:00.630 --> 03:28:00.640 align:start position:0%
that parents have the right to raise and
 
03:28:02.710 --> 03:28:02.720 align:start position:0%
educate their own children that it's not
 
03:28:05.190 --> 03:28:05.200 align:start position:0%
up to the state to make those decisions
 
03:28:07.349 --> 03:28:07.359 align:start position:0%
especially very personal very intimate
 
03:28:08.950 --> 03:28:08.960 align:start position:0%
and decisions about their development
 
03:28:11.269 --> 03:28:11.279 align:start position:0%
their emotional and sexual development
 
03:28:13.429 --> 03:28:13.439 align:start position:0%
and it's it's therefore my opinion that
 
03:28:14.950 --> 03:28:14.960 align:start position:0%
after having read this bill and listen
 
03:28:16.229 --> 03:28:16.239 align:start position:0%
to both sides and look through the
 
03:28:18.630 --> 03:28:18.640 align:start position:0%
issues and receive the emails of course
 
03:28:20.630 --> 03:28:20.640 align:start position:0%
and heard the uh the responses from
 
03:28:22.710 --> 03:28:22.720 align:start position:0%
members of the other side that i still
 
03:28:24.550 --> 03:28:24.560 align:start position:0%
believe that parents need to be the ones
 
03:28:26.550 --> 03:28:26.560 align:start position:0%
who are notified by the school
 
03:28:28.389 --> 03:28:28.399 align:start position:0%
and and make the important decisions
 
03:28:30.469 --> 03:28:30.479 align:start position:0%
themselves please ignore the color of my
 
03:28:33.990 --> 03:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
shirt today and press the green button
 
03:28:40.950 --> 03:28:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:42.630 --> 03:28:42.640 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
03:28:44.790 --> 03:28:44.800 align:start position:0%
mr speaker i would like to begin by
 
03:28:46.630 --> 03:28:46.640 align:start position:0%
dispelling some of the propaganda
 
03:28:48.550 --> 03:28:48.560 align:start position:0%
surrounding this bill
 
03:28:50.469 --> 03:28:50.479 align:start position:0%
critics say that this bill requires
 
03:28:53.670 --> 03:28:53.680 align:start position:0%
educators to inform parents of a child's
 
03:28:55.830 --> 03:28:55.840 align:start position:0%
gender identity or expression thus
 
03:28:59.349 --> 03:28:59.359 align:start position:0%
requiring them to out the child
 
03:29:00.950 --> 03:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
that is not what the language of this
 
03:29:04.150 --> 03:29:04.160 align:start position:0%
bill says it says a parent has the right
 
03:29:06.469 --> 03:29:06.479 align:start position:0%
to be notified when a school employee
 
03:29:09.349 --> 03:29:09.359 align:start position:0%
initiates investigates or finds the need
 
03:29:11.990 --> 03:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
for action relating to the school's
 
03:29:12.000 --> 03:29:13.429 align:start position:0%
for action relating to the school's
policy

03:29:13.429 --> 03:29:13.439 align:start position:0%
policy
 
03:29:14.950 --> 03:29:14.960 align:start position:0%
regarding the student's gender
 
03:29:17.349 --> 03:29:17.359 align:start position:0%
expression and identity nowhere in this
 
03:29:19.670 --> 03:29:19.680 align:start position:0%
bill does it say that if a student
 
03:29:21.990 --> 03:29:22.000 align:start position:0%
confides in their teacher about their
 
03:29:23.670 --> 03:29:23.680 align:start position:0%
gender identity that the teacher must
 
03:29:26.070 --> 03:29:26.080 align:start position:0%
immediately call the parent to divulge
 
03:29:27.750 --> 03:29:27.760 align:start position:0%
that information
 
03:29:29.830 --> 03:29:29.840 align:start position:0%
in addition there is nothing in current
 
03:29:32.550 --> 03:29:32.560 align:start position:0%
law that prevents a teacher from outing
 
03:29:35.590 --> 03:29:35.600 align:start position:0%
a child to a parent now
 
03:29:37.269 --> 03:29:37.279 align:start position:0%
the concern i've heard expressed is that
 
03:29:39.429 --> 03:29:39.439 align:start position:0%
the parent would be told that they
 
03:29:41.349 --> 03:29:41.359 align:start position:0%
perhaps have a transgender child and
 
03:29:43.190 --> 03:29:43.200 align:start position:0%
that the child would be endangered
 
03:29:45.750 --> 03:29:45.760 align:start position:0%
because the parent might abuse them
 
03:29:48.550 --> 03:29:48.560 align:start position:0%
we cannot presume that all parents are
 
03:29:51.190 --> 03:29:51.200 align:start position:0%
guilty until proven innocent
 
03:29:53.110 --> 03:29:53.120 align:start position:0%
if we presume that parents are all
 
03:29:55.670 --> 03:29:55.680 align:start position:0%
abusive then schools would never inform
 
03:29:58.309 --> 03:29:58.319 align:start position:0%
the parents of any number of issues with
 
03:30:01.269 --> 03:30:01.279 align:start position:0%
the child including poor behavior as it
 
03:30:03.750 --> 03:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
might result in an abusive situation at
 
03:30:03.760 --> 03:30:04.870 align:start position:0%
might result in an abusive situation at
home

03:30:04.870 --> 03:30:04.880 align:start position:0%
home
 
03:30:06.389 --> 03:30:06.399 align:start position:0%
we have never operated under this
 
03:30:08.870 --> 03:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
thought process before and we should not
 
03:30:10.710 --> 03:30:10.720 align:start position:0%
begin now
 
03:30:12.309 --> 03:30:12.319 align:start position:0%
as this bill is written there are
 
03:30:14.229 --> 03:30:14.239 align:start position:0%
several ways a school could withhold the
 
03:30:16.469 --> 03:30:16.479 align:start position:0%
information about the student if there
 
03:30:18.229 --> 03:30:18.239 align:start position:0%
is evidence that it would endanger the
 
03:30:18.239 --> 03:30:19.830 align:start position:0%
is evidence that it would endanger the
child

03:30:19.830 --> 03:30:19.840 align:start position:0%
child
 
03:30:22.229 --> 03:30:22.239 align:start position:0%
the good supportive parents have every
 
03:30:25.030 --> 03:30:25.040 align:start position:0%
right to know if there are actions taken
 
03:30:28.309 --> 03:30:28.319 align:start position:0%
in school that include their children
 
03:30:30.710 --> 03:30:30.720 align:start position:0%
i equate parental rights to firearm
 
03:30:30.720 --> 03:30:31.910 align:start position:0%
i equate parental rights to firearm
rights

03:30:31.910 --> 03:30:31.920 align:start position:0%
rights
 
03:30:34.309 --> 03:30:34.319 align:start position:0%
there are criminals yes
 
03:30:35.910 --> 03:30:35.920 align:start position:0%
and one of the primary purposes of
 
03:30:38.950 --> 03:30:38.960 align:start position:0%
government is to punish wrongdoings
 
03:30:41.190 --> 03:30:41.200 align:start position:0%
but restricting rights from law-abiding
 
03:30:43.510 --> 03:30:43.520 align:start position:0%
parents and gun owners does not prevent
 
03:30:46.070 --> 03:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
criminals from participating in criminal
 
03:30:46.080 --> 03:30:47.830 align:start position:0%
criminals from participating in criminal
activities

03:30:47.830 --> 03:30:47.840 align:start position:0%
activities
 
03:30:49.990 --> 03:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
parents are programmed to love and care
 
03:30:52.710 --> 03:30:52.720 align:start position:0%
for their children like no other adult
 
03:30:54.950 --> 03:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
and we should be supporting parents so
 
03:30:56.550 --> 03:30:56.560 align:start position:0%
they can protect their children from
 
03:30:59.349 --> 03:30:59.359 align:start position:0%
potential bad actors and influences
 
03:31:01.590 --> 03:31:01.600 align:start position:0%
outside of the home please press the
 
03:31:04.070 --> 03:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
green button to support this moderate
 
03:31:08.710 --> 03:31:08.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:10.630 --> 03:31:10.640 align:start position:0%
house will be in order
 
03:31:18.950 --> 03:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:21.269 --> 03:31:21.279 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
03:31:22.950 --> 03:31:22.960 align:start position:0%
mr speaker
 
03:31:25.110 --> 03:31:25.120 align:start position:0%
in my previous life
 
03:31:26.389 --> 03:31:26.399 align:start position:0%
my job
 
03:31:28.550 --> 03:31:28.560 align:start position:0%
was to be in charge of investigations
 
03:31:32.150 --> 03:31:32.160 align:start position:0%
for educator misconduct
 
03:31:33.830 --> 03:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
as part of that
 
03:31:35.429 --> 03:31:35.439 align:start position:0%
we learned
 
03:31:37.590 --> 03:31:37.600 align:start position:0%
that there are certain behaviors
 
03:31:39.590 --> 03:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
in the field
 
03:31:42.229 --> 03:31:42.239 align:start position:0%
that needed to be addressed
 
03:31:44.790 --> 03:31:44.800 align:start position:0%
and part of that was was
 
03:31:47.429 --> 03:31:47.439 align:start position:0%
how these relationships developed there
 
03:31:49.190 --> 03:31:49.200 align:start position:0%
are a lot of words to use for it one of
 
03:31:51.349 --> 03:31:51.359 align:start position:0%
them is grooming
 
03:31:53.910 --> 03:31:53.920 align:start position:0%
well what if we were here today talking
 
03:31:53.920 --> 03:31:55.110 align:start position:0%
well what if we were here today talking
about

03:31:55.110 --> 03:31:55.120 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:31:57.349 --> 03:31:57.359 align:start position:0%
allowing police officers to have secret
 
03:31:57.359 --> 03:31:58.790 align:start position:0%
allowing police officers to have secret
relationships

03:31:58.790 --> 03:31:58.800 align:start position:0%
relationships
 
03:32:00.710 --> 03:32:00.720 align:start position:0%
with your child
 
03:32:00.720 --> 03:32:01.830 align:start position:0%
with your child
where

03:32:01.830 --> 03:32:01.840 align:start position:0%
where
 
03:32:03.429 --> 03:32:03.439 align:start position:0%
the parent had no right to know what was
 
03:32:04.550 --> 03:32:04.560 align:start position:0%
going on
 
03:32:06.469 --> 03:32:06.479 align:start position:0%
and they could talk about sex or
 
03:32:08.710 --> 03:32:08.720 align:start position:0%
anything gender whatever and you
 
03:32:10.790 --> 03:32:10.800 align:start position:0%
couldn't find out what that was
 
03:32:12.550 --> 03:32:12.560 align:start position:0%
i don't think we'd be having this debate
 
03:32:13.670 --> 03:32:13.680 align:start position:0%
because we would all think it's
 
03:32:13.680 --> 03:32:15.670 align:start position:0%
because we would all think it's
ludicrous

03:32:15.670 --> 03:32:15.680 align:start position:0%
ludicrous
 
03:32:17.830 --> 03:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
as part of my job we looked at trends
 
03:32:19.510 --> 03:32:19.520 align:start position:0%
and studies
 
03:32:19.520 --> 03:32:20.550 align:start position:0%
and studies
and

03:32:20.550 --> 03:32:20.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:32:22.150 --> 03:32:22.160 align:start position:0%
teachers are no different than police
 
03:32:24.309 --> 03:32:24.319 align:start position:0%
officers or state representatives we're
 
03:32:26.710 --> 03:32:26.720 align:start position:0%
all made up of the same population
 
03:32:28.469 --> 03:32:28.479 align:start position:0%
there's not a special island somewhere
 
03:32:29.990 --> 03:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
where we grow police officers or
 
03:32:30.000 --> 03:32:30.950 align:start position:0%
where we grow police officers or
teachers

03:32:30.950 --> 03:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
teachers
 
03:32:32.870 --> 03:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
they're all just like you and me
 
03:32:35.190 --> 03:32:35.200 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately among all of us there
 
03:32:37.190 --> 03:32:37.200 align:start position:0%
are a few bad apples that we have to
 
03:32:39.670 --> 03:32:39.680 align:start position:0%
watch and protect children from
 
03:32:41.429 --> 03:32:41.439 align:start position:0%
now if i'm the type of person who has
 
03:32:44.070 --> 03:32:44.080 align:start position:0%
that affliction that i am attracted to
 
03:32:46.229 --> 03:32:46.239 align:start position:0%
children what kind of field would i get
 
03:32:48.710 --> 03:32:48.720 align:start position:0%
into as my career
 
03:32:48.720 --> 03:32:49.750 align:start position:0%
into as my career
now

03:32:49.750 --> 03:32:49.760 align:start position:0%
now
 
03:32:52.150 --> 03:32:52.160 align:start position:0%
that's the tiny minority
 
03:32:57.910 --> 03:32:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:59.910 --> 03:32:59.920 align:start position:0%
there's no doubt that teachers have a
 
03:33:02.309 --> 03:33:02.319 align:start position:0%
profound effect on the lives of their
 
03:33:02.319 --> 03:33:03.429 align:start position:0%
profound effect on the lives of their
students

03:33:03.429 --> 03:33:03.439 align:start position:0%
students
 
03:33:05.510 --> 03:33:05.520 align:start position:0%
the student teacher connection can be
 
03:33:07.750 --> 03:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
positive transforming
 
03:33:10.229 --> 03:33:10.239 align:start position:0%
opening possibilities for the student
 
03:33:12.469 --> 03:33:12.479 align:start position:0%
conversely the power imbalance presented
 
03:33:14.389 --> 03:33:14.399 align:start position:0%
in this influential relationship may be
 
03:33:17.110 --> 03:33:17.120 align:start position:0%
abused resulting in long-term trauma to
 
03:33:19.670 --> 03:33:19.680 align:start position:0%
the student this particularly the case
 
03:33:21.349 --> 03:33:21.359 align:start position:0%
for some sex offenders who use the
 
03:33:24.469 --> 03:33:24.479 align:start position:0%
profession of teaching to target victims
 
03:33:26.790 --> 03:33:26.800 align:start position:0%
the case of mary kayla turno captured
 
03:33:28.469 --> 03:33:28.479 align:start position:0%
national attention when she was
 
03:33:30.309 --> 03:33:30.319 align:start position:0%

let's all remember the name pamela smart
 
03:33:49.510 --> 03:33:49.520 align:start position:0%
grooming is a term used to describe the
 
03:33:51.190 --> 03:33:51.200 align:start position:0%
process by which a sex offender
 
03:33:52.790 --> 03:33:52.800 align:start position:0%
carefully initiates and maintains
 
03:33:54.389 --> 03:33:54.399 align:start position:0%
sexually abusive relationships with
 
03:33:56.630 --> 03:33:56.640 align:start position:0%
children grooming is a conscious
 
03:33:58.630 --> 03:33:58.640 align:start position:0%
deliberate and carefully orchestrated
 
03:34:01.510 --> 03:34:01.520 align:start position:0%
approach used by an offender the goal of
 
03:34:03.830 --> 03:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
grooming is to permit a sexual encounter
 
03:34:05.510 --> 03:34:05.520 align:start position:0%
and keep it secret
 
03:34:07.349 --> 03:34:07.359 align:start position:0%
the grooming process encompasses a
 
03:34:10.229 --> 03:34:10.239 align:start position:0%
variety of methods used by the offender
 
03:34:12.070 --> 03:34:12.080 align:start position:0%
in addition the method helped maintain
 
03:34:13.990 --> 03:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
the abusive relationship by encouraging
 
03:34:17.750 --> 03:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
complicity and secrecy of the victim
 
03:34:20.469 --> 03:34:20.479 align:start position:0%
here are just a quick few of the things
 
03:34:22.229 --> 03:34:22.239 align:start position:0%
that we watch out for when we look for
 
03:34:25.590 --> 03:34:25.600 align:start position:0%
grooming behavior among educators
 
03:34:28.389 --> 03:34:28.399 align:start position:0%
adults parents any profession when
 
03:34:30.229 --> 03:34:30.239 align:start position:0%

targeting
 
03:34:33.990 --> 03:34:34.000 align:start position:0%
they look for vulnerable children
 
03:34:37.190 --> 03:34:37.200 align:start position:0%
for example those with low self-esteem
 
03:34:39.750 --> 03:34:39.760 align:start position:0%
low self-confidence
 
03:34:41.429 --> 03:34:41.439 align:start position:0%
children with less parental oversight
 
03:34:42.950 --> 03:34:42.960 align:start position:0%
whose parents really aren't involved in
 
03:34:44.630 --> 03:34:44.640 align:start position:0%
their lives
 
03:34:47.349 --> 03:34:47.359 align:start position:0%

children
 
03:34:50.550 --> 03:34:50.560 align:start position:0%
it sounds awful like like the children
 
03:34:52.630 --> 03:34:52.640 align:start position:0%
we're trying to protect
 
03:34:55.510 --> 03:34:55.520 align:start position:0%
by allowing this kind of behavior
 
03:34:58.389 --> 03:34:58.399 align:start position:0%

03:35:02.469 --> 03:35:02.479 align:start position:0%
become welcome
 
03:35:05.429 --> 03:35:05.439 align:start position:0%
they give them gifts games special times
 
03:35:07.030 --> 03:35:07.040 align:start position:0%
they isolate the children from their
 
03:35:08.550 --> 03:35:08.560 align:start position:0%
family and friends
 
03:35:10.630 --> 03:35:10.640 align:start position:0%
they seize on feelings of being unloved

things of this nature
 
03:35:24.710 --> 03:35:24.720 align:start position:0%
use pretense of teaching and exploring
 
03:35:26.150 --> 03:35:26.160 align:start position:0%
in closeness
 
03:35:28.389 --> 03:35:28.399 align:start position:0%
they exploit the victims natural sexual
 
03:35:28.399 --> 03:35:29.750 align:start position:0%
they exploit the victims natural sexual
curiosity

03:35:29.750 --> 03:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
curiosity
 
03:35:31.750 --> 03:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
at that age
 
03:35:33.990 --> 03:35:34.000 align:start position:0%
then they use maintenance bribes gifts
 
03:35:36.150 --> 03:35:36.160 align:start position:0%
to ensure continued compliance threaten
 
03:35:39.429 --> 03:35:39.439 align:start position:0%
dire consequences to ensure secrecy
 
03:35:41.429 --> 03:35:41.439 align:start position:0%
threaten to blame the victim
 
03:35:44.229 --> 03:35:44.239 align:start position:0%
losing the loss of a loving relationship
 
03:35:46.229 --> 03:35:46.239 align:start position:0%
these are the exact kind of behaviors
 
03:35:49.110 --> 03:35:49.120 align:start position:0%
that we discourage and punish and send
 
03:35:50.790 --> 03:35:50.800 align:start position:0%
people to jail for
 
03:35:50.800 --> 03:35:52.550 align:start position:0%
people to jail for
yet

03:35:52.550 --> 03:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
yet
 
03:35:54.150 --> 03:35:54.160 align:start position:0%
opponents of this bill are saying we
 
03:35:55.429 --> 03:35:55.439 align:start position:0%
should allow
 
03:35:56.950 --> 03:35:56.960 align:start position:0%
and encourage
 
03:36:01.110 --> 03:36:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:03.750 --> 03:36:03.760 align:start position:0%
that when we say that this will be in
 
03:36:03.760 --> 03:36:04.830 align:start position:0%
that when we say that this will be in
order

03:36:04.830 --> 03:36:04.840 align:start position:0%
order
 
03:36:07.510 --> 03:36:07.520 align:start position:0%
people that people should be allowed to
 
03:36:14.469 --> 03:36:14.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:14.479 --> 03:36:15.349 align:start position:0%
 
how

03:36:15.349 --> 03:36:15.359 align:start position:0%
how
 
03:36:19.030 --> 03:36:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:19.040 --> 03:36:21.510 align:start position:0%
 
if

03:36:21.510 --> 03:36:21.520 align:start position:0%
if
 
03:36:21.520 --> 03:36:23.990 align:start position:0%
if
if

03:36:23.990 --> 03:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:26.070 --> 03:36:26.080 align:start position:0%
oh there is a motive it's clearly the
 
03:36:28.309 --> 03:36:28.319 align:start position:0%
motive is that you say that should not
 
03:36:30.469 --> 03:36:30.479 align:start position:0%
be able to have the representative the
 
03:36:32.790 --> 03:36:32.800 align:start position:0%
representative will stop
 
03:36:34.630 --> 03:36:34.640 align:start position:0%
i didn't hear the complete statement but
 
03:36:36.950 --> 03:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
i understand you were semi-implying
 
03:36:39.110 --> 03:36:39.120 align:start position:0%
motive which we don't do
 
03:36:41.190 --> 03:36:41.200 align:start position:0%
agreed mr speaker i'm not implying
 
03:36:42.710 --> 03:36:42.720 align:start position:0%
motive i'm saying
 
03:36:42.720 --> 03:36:44.870 align:start position:0%
motive i'm saying
that

03:36:44.870 --> 03:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:36:47.750 --> 03:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
to say that teachers should be able to
 
03:36:49.910 --> 03:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
have a secret with a child
 
03:36:51.590 --> 03:36:51.600 align:start position:0%
that's not a motive that's a fact that's
 
03:36:53.670 --> 03:36:53.680 align:start position:0%
what you're saying
 
03:36:58.150 --> 03:36:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:59.910 --> 03:36:59.920 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day
 
03:37:01.830 --> 03:37:01.840 align:start position:0%
the parents have a right to know
 
03:37:03.830 --> 03:37:03.840 align:start position:0%
remember the member will suspend
 
03:37:07.830 --> 03:37:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:09.590 --> 03:37:09.600 align:start position:0%
well in addition to what the previous
 
03:37:11.510 --> 03:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
member said i think he's not addressing
 
03:37:13.349 --> 03:37:13.359 align:start position:0%
the bill that this behavior he talks
 
03:37:15.670 --> 03:37:15.680 align:start position:0%
about is already illegal under existing
 
03:37:17.510 --> 03:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
law and this is uh
 
03:37:19.349 --> 03:37:19.359 align:start position:0%
not the main focus of
 
03:37:21.750 --> 03:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
what's before us so i think he's gone
 
03:37:24.150 --> 03:37:24.160 align:start position:0%
off topic thank you
 
03:37:24.160 --> 03:37:25.590 align:start position:0%
off topic thank you
i

03:37:25.590 --> 03:37:25.600 align:start position:0%
i
 
03:37:27.429 --> 03:37:27.439 align:start position:0%
how how's it been
 
03:37:32.550 --> 03:37:32.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:35.670 --> 03:37:35.680 align:start position:0%
my my instructions to the member are
 
03:37:38.790 --> 03:37:38.800 align:start position:0%
not into implied motive and and to talk
 
03:37:40.790 --> 03:37:40.800 align:start position:0%
about the bill
 
03:37:40.800 --> 03:37:42.630 align:start position:0%
about the bill
okay

03:37:42.630 --> 03:37:42.640 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:37:46.550 --> 03:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
to be clear i do not think that there is
 
03:37:49.429 --> 03:37:49.439 align:start position:0%
a motive for
 
03:37:51.910 --> 03:37:51.920 align:start position:0%
improper relationships
 
03:37:54.550 --> 03:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
what i am saying is that
 
03:37:57.429 --> 03:37:57.439 align:start position:0%
this kind of behavior is what allows it
 
03:37:58.870 --> 03:37:58.880 align:start position:0%
to happen
 
03:38:00.790 --> 03:38:00.800 align:start position:0%
and we know this
 
03:38:03.990 --> 03:38:04.000 align:start position:0%
it's been proven time and time again
 
03:38:05.830 --> 03:38:05.840 align:start position:0%
keeping secrets
 
03:38:07.269 --> 03:38:07.279 align:start position:0%
with children
 
03:38:09.110 --> 03:38:09.120 align:start position:0%
that their parents are not allowed to
 
03:38:11.510 --> 03:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
know about is classically proven
 
03:38:13.190 --> 03:38:13.200 align:start position:0%
behavior that leads to this type of
 
03:38:15.429 --> 03:38:15.439 align:start position:0%
thing and we always have to be on guard
 
03:38:17.429 --> 03:38:17.439 align:start position:0%
for it yes it makes you uncomfortable it
 
03:38:19.030 --> 03:38:19.040 align:start position:0%
makes me uncomfortable to have to talk
 
03:38:21.110 --> 03:38:21.120 align:start position:0%
about it but it should not be happening
 
03:38:24.550 --> 03:38:24.560 align:start position:0%
the parents should always be in the loop
 
03:38:25.510 --> 03:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:38:29.030 --> 03:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:31.349 --> 03:38:31.359 align:start position:0%
no member does not yield
 
03:38:39.429 --> 03:38:39.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:43.349 --> 03:38:43.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:46.309 --> 03:38:46.319 align:start position:0%
mr speaker today i rise in opposition to
 
03:38:49.110 --> 03:38:49.120 align:start position:0%
house bill 1431
 
03:38:51.590 --> 03:38:51.600 align:start position:0%
the parents bill of rights which may
 
03:38:53.670 --> 03:38:53.680 align:start position:0%
seem ironic given the fact that i'm a
 
03:38:56.550 --> 03:38:56.560 align:start position:0%
parent myself
 
03:38:58.630 --> 03:38:58.640 align:start position:0%
i believe wholeheartedly in parents
 
03:39:00.469 --> 03:39:00.479 align:start position:0%
taking responsibility for their
 
03:39:03.830 --> 03:39:03.840 align:start position:0%
children's education and medical care
 
03:39:06.070 --> 03:39:06.080 align:start position:0%
i also support school districts and
 
03:39:08.630 --> 03:39:08.640 align:start position:0%
health care facilities doing everything
 
03:39:11.349 --> 03:39:11.359 align:start position:0%
they can to engage with parents in
 
03:39:13.630 --> 03:39:13.640 align:start position:0%
building relationships built on
 
03:39:17.110 --> 03:39:17.120 align:start position:0%
transparency and trust
 
03:39:19.110 --> 03:39:19.120 align:start position:0%
but this bill isn't about building
 
03:39:19.120 --> 03:39:20.870 align:start position:0%
but this bill isn't about building
relationships

03:39:20.870 --> 03:39:20.880 align:start position:0%
relationships
 
03:39:23.750 --> 03:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
this bill is about a lack of trust that
 
03:39:27.110 --> 03:39:27.120 align:start position:0%
robs kids of the opportunity to connect
 
03:39:30.070 --> 03:39:30.080 align:start position:0%
with caring supportive adults
 
03:39:31.910 --> 03:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
at the time in their lives when many
 
03:39:35.110 --> 03:39:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:37.510 --> 03:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
many of the rights outlined in house
 
03:39:41.269 --> 03:39:41.279 align:start position:0%
bill 1431 are already law
 
03:39:43.510 --> 03:39:43.520 align:start position:0%
the right to enroll a child in a public
 
03:39:45.429 --> 03:39:45.439 align:start position:0%
private or home school the right to
 
03:39:47.349 --> 03:39:47.359 align:start position:0%
review school records
 
03:39:49.429 --> 03:39:49.439 align:start position:0%
the right to opt out of certain
 
03:39:51.910 --> 03:39:51.920 align:start position:0%
topics of instruction the right to
 
03:39:54.070 --> 03:39:54.080 align:start position:0%
review and object to particular
 
03:39:56.309 --> 03:39:56.319 align:start position:0%
instructional materials
 
03:39:59.590 --> 03:39:59.600 align:start position:0%
the right to access state standards
 
03:40:02.469 --> 03:40:02.479 align:start position:0%
services via an individual educational
 
03:40:02.479 --> 03:40:04.309 align:start position:0%
services via an individual educational
plan

03:40:04.309 --> 03:40:04.319 align:start position:0%
plan
 
03:40:06.710 --> 03:40:06.720 align:start position:0%
the right to enroll in title one or
 
03:40:09.349 --> 03:40:09.359 align:start position:0%
medicaid services
 
03:40:11.510 --> 03:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
all of these provisions are already
 
03:40:14.150 --> 03:40:14.160 align:start position:0%
defined and defended under state and
 
03:40:15.750 --> 03:40:15.760 align:start position:0%
federal statute
 
03:40:17.670 --> 03:40:17.680 align:start position:0%
so they are don't appear to be the
 
03:40:19.670 --> 03:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
rights that a parent would need to fight
 
03:40:19.680 --> 03:40:21.750 align:start position:0%
rights that a parent would need to fight
for

03:40:21.750 --> 03:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:40:23.030 --> 03:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
in addition
 
03:40:25.349 --> 03:40:25.359 align:start position:0%
there are some rights in this bill
 
03:40:28.469 --> 03:40:28.479 align:start position:0%
that don't seem right at all
 
03:40:31.990 --> 03:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
house bill 1431 would require schools to
 
03:40:34.950 --> 03:40:34.960 align:start position:0%
track and notify parents every time a
 
03:40:37.030 --> 03:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
student changed their extracurricular
 
03:40:39.670 --> 03:40:39.680 align:start position:0%
activities or joined a club
 
03:40:41.110 --> 03:40:41.120 align:start position:0%
like theater
 
03:40:43.750 --> 03:40:43.760 align:start position:0%
or destination imagination
 
03:40:46.550 --> 03:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
or the gay straight alliance
 
03:40:49.110 --> 03:40:49.120 align:start position:0%
schools would be required to report all
 
03:40:51.910 --> 03:40:51.920 align:start position:0%
discipline imposed by school authorities
 
03:40:54.950 --> 03:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
without defining either discipline or
 
03:40:57.429 --> 03:40:57.439 align:start position:0%
school authority
 
03:40:59.670 --> 03:40:59.680 align:start position:0%
does that mean if chatty seventh grade
 
03:40:59.680 --> 03:41:01.349 align:start position:0%
does that mean if chatty seventh grade
susie

03:41:01.349 --> 03:41:01.359 align:start position:0%
susie
 
03:41:03.429 --> 03:41:03.439 align:start position:0%
needs to have her seat changed that a
 
03:41:05.349 --> 03:41:05.359 align:start position:0%
call will be made home at the end of the
 
03:41:05.359 --> 03:41:06.710 align:start position:0%
call will be made home at the end of the
day

03:41:06.710 --> 03:41:06.720 align:start position:0%
day
 
03:41:09.349 --> 03:41:09.359 align:start position:0%
what if active alan throws a tater tot
 
03:41:12.150 --> 03:41:12.160 align:start position:0%
in the cafeteria is mr vice principal
 
03:41:15.750 --> 03:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
expected to call mom if he requires al
 
03:41:26.790 --> 03:41:26.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:30.790 --> 03:41:30.800 align:start position:0%
i spent 12 years as a 5th grade teacher
 
03:41:32.710 --> 03:41:32.720 align:start position:0%
and i can assure you
 
03:41:35.349 --> 03:41:35.359 align:start position:0%
that dealing with student discipline
 
03:41:38.950 --> 03:41:38.960 align:start position:0%
is a major portion of every day
 
03:41:41.110 --> 03:41:41.120 align:start position:0%
what will happen when teachers have 15
 
03:41:42.710 --> 03:41:42.720 align:start position:0%
phone calls to make at the end of the
 
03:41:42.720 --> 03:41:43.910 align:start position:0%
phone calls to make at the end of the
day

03:41:43.910 --> 03:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
day
 
03:41:46.070 --> 03:41:46.080 align:start position:0%
i can guess that fewer teachers will
 
03:41:48.950 --> 03:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
report loving their jobs and loving your
 
03:41:51.750 --> 03:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
job is exactly what makes a great
 
03:41:51.760 --> 03:41:53.590 align:start position:0%
job is exactly what makes a great
teacher

03:41:53.590 --> 03:41:53.600 align:start position:0%
teacher
 
03:41:55.830 --> 03:41:55.840 align:start position:0%
and how about the conversations the kids
 
03:41:58.070 --> 03:41:58.080 align:start position:0%
have with the principal or the assistant
 
03:42:00.150 --> 03:42:00.160 align:start position:0%
that are meant to redirect or inspire
 
03:42:03.030 --> 03:42:03.040 align:start position:0%
them our administrators are well loved
 
03:42:04.630 --> 03:42:04.640 align:start position:0%
by the students
 
03:42:06.950 --> 03:42:06.960 align:start position:0%
as a teacher i would frequently ask one
 
03:42:09.510 --> 03:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
of them to intervene who's making that
 
03:42:09.520 --> 03:42:10.469 align:start position:0%
of them to intervene who's making that
call

03:42:10.469 --> 03:42:10.479 align:start position:0%
call
 
03:42:12.790 --> 03:42:12.800 align:start position:0%
and how long might it be before the
 
03:42:14.710 --> 03:42:14.720 align:start position:0%
taxpayer is on the hook
 
03:42:17.030 --> 03:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
for the additional staff that it takes
 
03:42:21.750 --> 03:42:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:24.309 --> 03:42:24.319 align:start position:0%
the most meaningful professional work i
 
03:42:27.830 --> 03:42:27.840 align:start position:0%
did was as a school counselor
 
03:42:30.389 --> 03:42:30.399 align:start position:0%
for 27 years i had the privilege of
 
03:42:32.710 --> 03:42:32.720 align:start position:0%
assisting students and families during
 
03:42:36.630 --> 03:42:36.640 align:start position:0%
the most difficult times of their lives
 
03:42:39.189 --> 03:42:39.199 align:start position:0%
i have held students as they cried over
 
03:42:42.150 --> 03:42:42.160 align:start position:0%
the loss of a parent
 
03:42:44.870 --> 03:42:44.880 align:start position:0%
i have held parents who lost children to
 
03:42:44.880 --> 03:42:45.910 align:start position:0%
i have held parents who lost children to
illness

03:42:45.910 --> 03:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
illness
 
03:42:49.349 --> 03:42:49.359 align:start position:0%
to drugs to depression
 
03:42:51.910 --> 03:42:51.920 align:start position:0%
my door was always open and my office a
 
03:42:54.630 --> 03:42:54.640 align:start position:0%
refuge for kids and adults who needed a
 
03:42:55.910 --> 03:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
listening ear
 
03:42:58.469 --> 03:42:58.479 align:start position:0%
and a compassionate heart to navigate
 
03:43:00.630 --> 03:43:00.640 align:start position:0%
the challenges that come to all of us
 
03:43:03.030 --> 03:43:03.040 align:start position:0%
sooner or later
 
03:43:05.429 --> 03:43:05.439 align:start position:0%
as i stand here today i'm the voice of
 
03:43:08.710 --> 03:43:08.720 align:start position:0%
every dedicated school counselor
 
03:43:12.389 --> 03:43:12.399 align:start position:0%
why would you want to silence me
 
03:43:15.429 --> 03:43:15.439 align:start position:0%
sometimes advocating for a student meant
 
03:43:17.429 --> 03:43:17.439 align:start position:0%
taking on the school
 
03:43:20.309 --> 03:43:20.319 align:start position:0%
the teacher really was being mean the
 
03:43:23.189 --> 03:43:23.199 align:start position:0%
current plan just wasn't working
 
03:43:24.870 --> 03:43:24.880 align:start position:0%
the student couldn't get their homework
 
03:43:27.750 --> 03:43:27.760 align:start position:0%
done because nobody at home could help
 
03:43:29.590 --> 03:43:29.600 align:start position:0%
and if you think i'm kidding try doing
 
03:43:31.750 --> 03:43:31.760 align:start position:0%
your 7th grade students math homework
 
03:43:35.750 --> 03:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
and see how well you do
 
03:43:37.670 --> 03:43:37.680 align:start position:0%
sometimes i needed to address the
 
03:43:37.680 --> 03:43:39.349 align:start position:0%
sometimes i needed to address the
parents

03:43:39.349 --> 03:43:39.359 align:start position:0%
parents
 
03:43:41.990 --> 03:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
he's worried about your drinking
 
03:43:45.590 --> 03:43:45.600 align:start position:0%
the divorce has her totally distracted
 
03:43:47.590 --> 03:43:47.600 align:start position:0%
maybe something's interfering with his
 
03:43:49.429 --> 03:43:49.439 align:start position:0%
learning did either one of you have
 
03:43:52.070 --> 03:43:52.080 align:start position:0%
trouble in school
 
03:43:53.830 --> 03:43:53.840 align:start position:0%
sometimes i needed to confront the
 
03:43:53.840 --> 03:43:55.269 align:start position:0%
sometimes i needed to confront the
student

03:43:55.269 --> 03:43:55.279 align:start position:0%
student
 
03:43:55.279 --> 03:43:56.309 align:start position:0%
student
well

03:43:56.309 --> 03:43:56.319 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:43:58.229 --> 03:43:58.239 align:start position:0%
what are you doing if you're not doing
 
03:44:00.469 --> 03:44:00.479 align:start position:0%
your homework
 
03:44:02.389 --> 03:44:02.399 align:start position:0%
what did you expect would happen if you
 
03:44:06.389 --> 03:44:06.399 align:start position:0%
waited until the day before it was due
 
03:44:09.189 --> 03:44:09.199 align:start position:0%
what made you think that was an opinion
 
03:44:12.070 --> 03:44:12.080 align:start position:0%
that you should share
 
03:44:14.630 --> 03:44:14.640 align:start position:0%
like every dedicated school counselor i
 
03:44:18.469 --> 03:44:18.479 align:start position:0%
based my work on honesty and compassion
 
03:44:22.550 --> 03:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
why would you want to silence me
 
03:44:24.870 --> 03:44:24.880 align:start position:0%
during my career i had multiple students
 
03:44:26.469 --> 03:44:26.479 align:start position:0%
disclosed to me that they had been
 
03:44:28.950 --> 03:44:28.960 align:start position:0%
sexually abused
 
03:44:30.630 --> 03:44:30.640 align:start position:0%
another that his mother was being
 
03:44:30.640 --> 03:44:32.550 align:start position:0%
another that his mother was being
assaulted

03:44:32.550 --> 03:44:32.560 align:start position:0%
assaulted
 
03:44:34.469 --> 03:44:34.479 align:start position:0%
one that a sibling was in trouble with
 
03:44:35.670 --> 03:44:35.680 align:start position:0%
the law
 
03:44:38.550 --> 03:44:38.560 align:start position:0%
one that a parent was going to jail and
 
03:44:40.389 --> 03:44:40.399 align:start position:0%
more than one that they had tried to
 
03:44:41.910 --> 03:44:41.920 align:start position:0%
take their own life because they didn't
 
03:44:45.030 --> 03:44:45.040 align:start position:0%
know what else to do
 
03:44:46.870 --> 03:44:46.880 align:start position:0%
some of these disclosures came
 
03:44:49.349 --> 03:44:49.359 align:start position:0%
relatively quickly but most of them were
 
03:44:52.870 --> 03:44:52.880 align:start position:0%
the result of a tested relationship
 
03:44:56.710 --> 03:44:56.720 align:start position:0%
victimized kids need time
 
03:44:59.830 --> 03:44:59.840 align:start position:0%
kids with a secret are frequently scared
 
03:45:01.189 --> 03:45:01.199 align:start position:0%
to death
 
03:45:04.070 --> 03:45:04.080 align:start position:0%
that speaking the truth will result in
 
03:45:06.790 --> 03:45:06.800 align:start position:0%
something even more horrifying than the
 
03:45:10.229 --> 03:45:10.239 align:start position:0%
reality of what they're living
 
03:45:12.309 --> 03:45:12.319 align:start position:0%
if that school counselor is the
 
03:45:15.110 --> 03:45:15.120 align:start position:0%
difference between hell or survival
 
03:45:18.950 --> 03:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
why would you want to silence them
 
03:45:21.189 --> 03:45:21.199 align:start position:0%
but we already know all of this new
 
03:45:23.349 --> 03:45:23.359 align:start position:0%
hampshire has been studying adverse
 
03:45:26.870 --> 03:45:26.880 align:start position:0%
childhood experiences for decades now
 
03:45:29.110 --> 03:45:29.120 align:start position:0%
we know that the single most protective
 
03:45:31.670 --> 03:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
factor in building resilient kids is
 
03:45:34.790 --> 03:45:34.800 align:start position:0%
engaging them in healthy relationships
 
03:45:37.510 --> 03:45:37.520 align:start position:0%
and we know that schools are an ideal
 
03:45:40.870 --> 03:45:40.880 align:start position:0%
place to lay the foundation of trust the
 
03:45:43.750 --> 03:45:43.760 align:start position:0%
kids need to thrive

offered me some vice some advice that
 
03:48:40.950 --> 03:48:40.960 align:start position:0%
has proven to be very valuable
 
03:48:42.389 --> 03:48:42.399 align:start position:0%

your point of view
 
03:48:57.830 --> 03:48:57.840 align:start position:0%
it is helpful
 
03:49:00.070 --> 03:49:00.080 align:start position:0%
to begin with a presumption that
 
03:49:02.469 --> 03:49:02.479 align:start position:0%
everyone at the table is motivated in
 
03:49:03.590 --> 03:49:03.600 align:start position:0%
some way
 
03:49:07.030 --> 03:49:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:08.710 --> 03:49:08.720 align:start position:0%
that has served me well
 
03:49:11.269 --> 03:49:11.279 align:start position:0%
here it has served me well elsewhere in
 
03:49:12.870 --> 03:49:12.880 align:start position:0%
my life
 
03:49:14.469 --> 03:49:14.479 align:start position:0%
and i believe that it would especially
 
03:49:16.710 --> 03:49:16.720 align:start position:0%
serve us well in the case of house bill
 
03:49:16.720 --> 03:49:19.590 align:start position:0%
serve us well in the case of house bill
1431.

03:49:19.590 --> 03:49:19.600 align:start position:0%
1431.
 
03:49:22.710 --> 03:49:22.720 align:start position:0%
this bill affirms the primacy
 
03:49:24.870 --> 03:49:24.880 align:start position:0%
of parents
 
03:49:27.030 --> 03:49:27.040 align:start position:0%
in raising their children to be happy
 
03:49:29.269 --> 03:49:29.279 align:start position:0%
healthy productive adults
 
03:49:30.950 --> 03:49:30.960 align:start position:0%
who can grow up and contribute
 
03:49:34.389 --> 03:49:34.399 align:start position:0%
positively to society
 
03:49:36.950 --> 03:49:36.960 align:start position:0%
the bill is five pages long it includes
 
03:49:38.950 --> 03:49:38.960 align:start position:0%
a number of different provisions
 
03:49:40.630 --> 03:49:40.640 align:start position:0%
including things like
 
03:49:42.630 --> 03:49:42.640 align:start position:0%
parents have the right to inspect the
 
03:49:44.070 --> 03:49:44.080 align:start position:0%
curriculum and know what their kids are
 
03:49:45.910 --> 03:49:45.920 align:start position:0%
learning in school
 
03:49:47.830 --> 03:49:47.840 align:start position:0%
it includes parents have a right to see
 
03:49:50.630 --> 03:49:50.640 align:start position:0%
the child's report card and to know
 
03:49:52.950 --> 03:49:52.960 align:start position:0%
why they're being promoted to the next
 
03:49:55.030 --> 03:49:55.040 align:start position:0%
grade or not or why they're being
 
03:49:58.309 --> 03:49:58.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:00.389 --> 03:50:00.399 align:start position:0%
it reaffirms some of the rights that are
 
03:50:02.469 --> 03:50:02.479 align:start position:0%
already outlined in statute such as the
 
03:50:02.479 --> 03:50:03.269 align:start position:0%
already outlined in statute such as the
right

03:50:03.269 --> 03:50:03.279 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:50:05.429 --> 03:50:05.439 align:start position:0%
to exempt your child from certain
 
03:50:05.439 --> 03:50:09.670 align:start position:0%
to exempt your child from certain
immunizations

03:50:09.670 --> 03:50:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:11.670 --> 03:50:11.680 align:start position:0%
in the five pages of this bill the term
 
03:50:15.510 --> 03:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
gender expression is used exactly once
 
03:50:17.429 --> 03:50:17.439 align:start position:0%
and yet
 
03:50:19.590 --> 03:50:19.600 align:start position:0%
that has become the pivot point upon
 
03:50:21.910 --> 03:50:21.920 align:start position:0%
which the passage or failure of this
 
03:50:25.510 --> 03:50:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:31.349 --> 03:50:31.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:34.150 --> 03:50:34.160 align:start position:0%
we all know someone who has struggled
 
03:50:37.189 --> 03:50:37.199 align:start position:0%
with their sexual orientation
 
03:50:39.830 --> 03:50:39.840 align:start position:0%
or their gender identity
 
03:50:42.630 --> 03:50:42.640 align:start position:0%
in who has suffered emotional pain as a
 
03:50:42.640 --> 03:50:44.229 align:start position:0%
in who has suffered emotional pain as a
result

03:50:44.229 --> 03:50:44.239 align:start position:0%
result
 
03:50:46.229 --> 03:50:46.239 align:start position:0%
we all know someone who has been
 
03:50:48.710 --> 03:50:48.720 align:start position:0%
rejected ostracized
 
03:50:56.070 --> 03:50:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:58.229 --> 03:50:58.239 align:start position:0%
so in keeping with the words of the
 
03:51:01.189 --> 03:51:01.199 align:start position:0%
chairman of my committee i think that we
 
03:51:04.710 --> 03:51:04.720 align:start position:0%
ought to to honor the concerns and fears
 
03:51:09.990 --> 03:51:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:12.070 --> 03:51:12.080 align:start position:0%
i can't imagine what it is like to
 
03:51:14.830 --> 03:51:14.840 align:start position:0%
suffer that kind of
 
03:51:17.990 --> 03:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
difficulty especially as a teenager
 
03:51:19.910 --> 03:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry that it happens
 
03:51:22.630 --> 03:51:22.640 align:start position:0%
and i wish i could wave a magic wand and
 
03:51:25.110 --> 03:51:25.120 align:start position:0%
make it go away
 
03:51:27.510 --> 03:51:27.520 align:start position:0%
whether this bill passes or fails
 
03:51:30.950 --> 03:51:30.960 align:start position:0%
will not change that
 
03:51:34.070 --> 03:51:34.080 align:start position:0%
what this bill will do
 
03:51:37.750 --> 03:51:37.760 align:start position:0%
is recognize that parents are the
 
03:51:39.429 --> 03:51:39.439 align:start position:0%
primary agents
 
03:51:42.830 --> 03:51:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:48.790 --> 03:51:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:50.950 --> 03:51:50.960 align:start position:0%
this would also constitute a very
 
03:51:53.590 --> 03:51:53.600 align:start position:0%
meaningful step toward restoring trust
 
03:51:55.990 --> 03:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
in our schools
 
03:51:58.150 --> 03:51:58.160 align:start position:0%
public schools across the country have
 
03:52:00.710 --> 03:52:00.720 align:start position:0%
faced a litany of criticism over the
 
03:52:03.670 --> 03:52:03.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:05.750 --> 03:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
and much of that criticism although we
 
03:52:07.429 --> 03:52:07.439 align:start position:0%
ought not to paint with too broad a
 
03:52:07.439 --> 03:52:08.229 align:start position:0%
ought not to paint with too broad a
brush

03:52:08.229 --> 03:52:08.239 align:start position:0%
brush
 
03:52:10.229 --> 03:52:10.239 align:start position:0%
much of that criticism
 
03:52:12.229 --> 03:52:12.239 align:start position:0%
has been deserved
 
03:52:14.229 --> 03:52:14.239 align:start position:0%
how do we build trust
 
03:52:18.309 --> 03:52:18.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:20.150 --> 03:52:20.160 align:start position:0%
one of the essential elements in the
 
03:52:22.389 --> 03:52:22.399 align:start position:0%
process of restoring trust
 
03:52:25.910 --> 03:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
is to extend some measure of trust to
 
03:52:25.920 --> 03:52:32.950 align:start position:0%
is to extend some measure of trust to
another

03:52:32.950 --> 03:52:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:35.269 --> 03:52:35.279 align:start position:0%
the fundamental question that we answer
 
03:52:40.070 --> 03:52:40.080 align:start position:0%
when we vote yes or no on this bill
 
03:52:42.070 --> 03:52:42.080 align:start position:0%
you intend this or not
 
03:52:44.630 --> 03:52:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:48.229 --> 03:52:48.239 align:start position:0%
do we trust parents
 
03:52:50.070 --> 03:52:50.080 align:start position:0%
do we believe that the vast majority of
 
03:52:52.469 --> 03:52:52.479 align:start position:0%
parents love their children
 
03:52:56.070 --> 03:52:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:59.269 --> 03:52:59.279 align:start position:0%
not necessarily that it's easy
 
03:53:01.990 --> 03:53:02.000 align:start position:0%
not that there isn't some
 
03:53:04.229 --> 03:53:04.239 align:start position:0%
difficulty and some tough conversations
 
03:53:06.630 --> 03:53:06.640 align:start position:0%
along the way but do we believe that the
 
03:53:08.550 --> 03:53:08.560 align:start position:0%
vast majority of parents
 
03:53:10.550 --> 03:53:10.560 align:start position:0%
love their children enough to support
 
03:53:10.560 --> 03:53:11.349 align:start position:0%
love their children enough to support
them

03:53:11.349 --> 03:53:11.359 align:start position:0%
them
 
03:53:15.590 --> 03:53:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:17.590 --> 03:53:17.600 align:start position:0%
this bill does not
 
03:53:20.070 --> 03:53:20.080 align:start position:0%
require a school to take action
 
03:53:22.710 --> 03:53:22.720 align:start position:0%
simply because a student is questioning
 
03:53:24.389 --> 03:53:24.399 align:start position:0%
their sexual orientation or gender
 
03:53:24.399 --> 03:53:26.469 align:start position:0%
their sexual orientation or gender
identity

03:53:26.469 --> 03:53:26.479 align:start position:0%
identity
 
03:53:27.910 --> 03:53:27.920 align:start position:0%
it does not
 
03:53:31.189 --> 03:53:31.199 align:start position:0%
prevent a student from confiding
 
03:53:35.030 --> 03:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
in a trusted adult at school
 
03:53:37.910 --> 03:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
and it does not compel an adult to
 
03:53:40.469 --> 03:53:40.479 align:start position:0%
violate that confidence
 
03:53:43.189 --> 03:53:43.199 align:start position:0%
what it does require
 
03:53:45.429 --> 03:53:45.439 align:start position:0%
is that if a student asks to be
 
03:53:48.710 --> 03:53:48.720 align:start position:0%
addressed by a differently gendered name
 
03:53:50.870 --> 03:53:50.880 align:start position:0%
or by different pronouns
 
03:53:53.990 --> 03:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
or to otherwise make a request to be
 
03:53:55.429 --> 03:53:55.439 align:start position:0%
treated differently
 
03:53:57.990 --> 03:53:58.000 align:start position:0%
in this in the public context of the
 
03:53:58.000 --> 03:54:00.309 align:start position:0%
in this in the public context of the
school

03:54:00.309 --> 03:54:00.319 align:start position:0%
school
 
03:54:02.469 --> 03:54:02.479 align:start position:0%
or in a way that triggers
 
03:54:05.510 --> 03:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
the school to act on a related policy
 
03:54:09.990 --> 03:54:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:11.590 --> 03:54:11.600 align:start position:0%
there was an article in this morning's
 
03:54:12.870 --> 03:54:12.880 align:start position:0%
union leader
 
03:54:15.110 --> 03:54:15.120 align:start position:0%
highlighting the story of a mother
 
03:54:16.950 --> 03:54:16.960 align:start position:0%
whose child in the manchester school
 
03:54:20.229 --> 03:54:20.239 align:start position:0%
system came out as transgender
 
03:54:22.710 --> 03:54:22.720 align:start position:0%
she was not notified and she has filed
 
03:54:22.720 --> 03:54:25.590 align:start position:0%
she was not notified and she has filed
suit

03:54:25.590 --> 03:54:25.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:27.990 --> 03:54:28.000 align:start position:0%
she was quoted in that article as saying
 
03:54:30.070 --> 03:54:30.080 align:start position:0%
if her not being told what's going on in
 
03:54:32.469 --> 03:54:32.479 align:start position:0%
their personal life in school things
 
03:54:34.309 --> 03:54:34.319 align:start position:0%
could take a turn for the worse if we
 
03:54:36.870 --> 03:54:36.880 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
03:54:38.870 --> 03:54:38.880 align:start position:0%
this came from somebody who has been
 
03:54:41.990 --> 03:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
teaching for 25 years
 
03:54:45.830 --> 03:54:45.840 align:start position:0%
has been teaching for 17 years
 
03:54:49.349 --> 03:54:49.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:53.110 --> 03:54:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:55.349 --> 03:54:55.359 align:start position:0%
this bill is a necessary and important
 
03:54:55.359 --> 03:54:56.150 align:start position:0%
this bill is a necessary and important
step

03:54:56.150 --> 03:54:56.160 align:start position:0%
step
 
03:54:57.990 --> 03:54:58.000 align:start position:0%
toward acknowledging the primary
 
03:54:59.590 --> 03:54:59.600 align:start position:0%
importance of parents
 
03:55:01.269 --> 03:55:01.279 align:start position:0%
in their children's lives
 
03:55:03.910 --> 03:55:03.920 align:start position:0%
and i ask my colleagues to vote yes on
 
03:55:05.110 --> 03:55:05.120 align:start position:0%

no remember does not yield
 
03:55:14.550 --> 03:55:14.560 align:start position:0%
roll call has been requested by
 
03:55:16.309 --> 03:55:16.319 align:start position:0%
representative silber is that sufficient
 
03:55:18.150 --> 03:55:18.160 align:start position:0%

so

03:56:15.189 --> 03:56:15.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:15.199 --> 03:56:28.469 align:start position:0%
 
clearer

03:56:28.469 --> 03:56:28.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:30.710 --> 03:56:30.720 align:start position:0%
we just put the question so
 
03:56:30.720 --> 03:56:32.070 align:start position:0%
we just put the question so
no

no
 
03:56:49.590 --> 03:56:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:51.670 --> 03:56:51.680 align:start position:0%
the motion before us
 
03:56:53.750 --> 03:56:53.760 align:start position:0%
is the committee conference report on h
 
03:56:55.670 --> 03:56:55.680 align:start position:0%

this is going to be a roll call vote
 
03:57:00.229 --> 03:57:00.239 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative long
 
03:57:04.630 --> 03:57:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:07.110 --> 03:57:07.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker mr speaker if i
 
03:57:08.469 --> 03:57:08.479 align:start position:0%
know that the issues that were brought
 
03:57:10.950 --> 03:57:10.960 align:start position:0%
up in the debate was not brought up

thank you mr speaker
 
04:02:59.910 --> 04:02:59.920 align:start position:0%
i rise to speak in opposition to the
 
04:03:01.510 --> 04:03:01.520 align:start position:0%
committee conference report on house
 
04:03:04.229 --> 04:03:04.239 align:start position:0%
bill 1567.
 
04:03:05.830 --> 04:03:05.840 align:start position:0%
the bill is originally amended by the
 
04:03:08.070 --> 04:03:08.080 align:start position:0%
house proposed fining a municipality if
 
04:03:10.950 --> 04:03:10.960 align:start position:0%
an election official negligently
 
04:03:12.950 --> 04:03:12.960 align:start position:0%
failed to perform his duties
 
04:03:14.710 --> 04:03:14.720 align:start position:0%
the minority of the committee opposed
 
04:03:16.229 --> 04:03:16.239 align:start position:0%
the amendment because we were concerned
 
04:03:18.389 --> 04:03:18.399 align:start position:0%
about a lack of due process
 
04:03:20.309 --> 04:03:20.319 align:start position:0%
the committee of conference report
 
04:03:23.670 --> 04:03:23.680 align:start position:0%
however did address that concern
 
04:03:25.590 --> 04:03:25.600 align:start position:0%
it now provides that
 
04:03:27.269 --> 04:03:27.279 align:start position:0%
communities would have an opportunity to
 
04:03:27.279 --> 04:03:28.630 align:start position:0%
communities would have an opportunity to
respond

04:03:28.630 --> 04:03:28.640 align:start position:0%
respond
 
04:03:30.389 --> 04:03:30.399 align:start position:0%
upon receipt of the attorney general's
 
04:03:30.399 --> 04:03:31.590 align:start position:0%
upon receipt of the attorney general's
notice

04:03:31.590 --> 04:03:31.600 align:start position:0%
notice
 
04:03:34.229 --> 04:03:34.239 align:start position:0%
of intent to seek a civil penalty as to
 
04:03:37.429 --> 04:03:37.439 align:start position:0%
why the penalty should not be imposed
 
04:03:38.950 --> 04:03:38.960 align:start position:0%
and if that was the only change that was
 
04:03:41.030 --> 04:03:41.040 align:start position:0%
made to the bill i wouldn't be standing
 
04:03:44.790 --> 04:03:44.800 align:start position:0%
here in opposition to the report
 
04:03:46.229 --> 04:03:46.239 align:start position:0%
but the committee conference added
 
04:03:48.229 --> 04:03:48.239 align:start position:0%
language which should concern anyone who
 
04:03:50.469 --> 04:03:50.479 align:start position:0%
works at the polling place on election
 
04:03:50.479 --> 04:03:51.750 align:start position:0%
works at the polling place on election
day

04:03:51.750 --> 04:03:51.760 align:start position:0%
day
 
04:03:54.309 --> 04:03:54.319 align:start position:0%
the proposed amendment provides that any
 
04:03:56.229 --> 04:03:56.239 align:start position:0%
election official
 
04:03:58.229 --> 04:03:58.239 align:start position:0%
who knowingly fails to perform his
 
04:03:58.239 --> 04:03:59.189 align:start position:0%
who knowingly fails to perform his
duties

04:03:59.189 --> 04:03:59.199 align:start position:0%
duties
 
04:04:09.910 --> 04:04:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:11.830 --> 04:04:11.840 align:start position:0%
it's all getting awful noisy in here the
 
04:04:14.070 --> 04:04:14.080 align:start position:0%
member has a right to speak
 
04:04:17.269 --> 04:04:17.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:18.790 --> 04:04:18.800 align:start position:0%
the bill does not give the election
 
04:04:21.830 --> 04:04:21.840 align:start position:0%
official 45 days to explain why he
 
04:04:24.150 --> 04:04:24.160 align:start position:0%
should not be prosecuted he doesn't have
 
04:04:26.469 --> 04:04:26.479 align:start position:0%
the same
 
04:04:30.070 --> 04:04:30.080 align:start position:0%
opportunities that the municipality has
 
04:04:31.429 --> 04:04:31.439 align:start position:0%
there are several legal terms that are
 
04:04:33.910 --> 04:04:33.920 align:start position:0%
used to describe the mental state of a
 
04:04:37.030 --> 04:04:37.040 align:start position:0%
person who allegedly commits a crime
 
04:04:39.510 --> 04:04:39.520 align:start position:0%
words like intentionally knowingly
 
04:04:41.830 --> 04:04:41.840 align:start position:0%
willfully recklessly
 
04:04:44.070 --> 04:04:44.080 align:start position:0%
or negligent negligently all have
 
04:04:46.150 --> 04:04:46.160 align:start position:0%
different meanings
 
04:04:48.309 --> 04:04:48.319 align:start position:0%
the constitution provides that a person
 
04:04:49.910 --> 04:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
may lose his right to vote if he
 
04:04:49.920 --> 04:04:51.269 align:start position:0%
may lose his right to vote if he
willfully

04:04:51.269 --> 04:04:51.279 align:start position:0%
willfully
 
04:04:54.229 --> 04:04:54.239 align:start position:0%
violates the election laws of this state
 
04:04:56.870 --> 04:04:56.880 align:start position:0%
by definition an act is done willfully
 
04:04:59.189 --> 04:04:59.199 align:start position:0%
if done voluntarily and intentionally
 
04:05:01.510 --> 04:05:01.520 align:start position:0%
and with a specific intent to do
 
04:05:04.309 --> 04:05:04.319 align:start position:0%
something the law forbids
 
04:05:06.309 --> 04:05:06.319 align:start position:0%
this report proposes taking away a
 
04:05:09.030 --> 04:05:09.040 align:start position:0%
person's right to vote if he knowingly
 
04:05:12.229 --> 04:05:12.239 align:start position:0%
fails to perform an election duty
 
04:05:14.469 --> 04:05:14.479 align:start position:0%
knowingly with respect to conduct means
 
04:05:16.389 --> 04:05:16.399 align:start position:0%
that a person has actual knowledge or
 
04:05:18.150 --> 04:05:18.160 align:start position:0%
should have known
 
04:05:21.349 --> 04:05:21.359 align:start position:0%
of the conduct or the circumstances
 
04:05:22.469 --> 04:05:22.479 align:start position:0%
i know that there are a number of
 
04:05:24.710 --> 04:05:24.720 align:start position:0%
members of this chamber who have served
 
04:05:26.469 --> 04:05:26.479 align:start position:0%
as election officials
 
04:05:28.710 --> 04:05:28.720 align:start position:0%
as supervisors of the checklist
 
04:05:32.309 --> 04:05:32.319 align:start position:0%
selectmen moderators ballot clerks
 
04:05:33.990 --> 04:05:34.000 align:start position:0%
and i wonder how many of them on their
 
04:05:35.830 --> 04:05:35.840 align:start position:0%
first day of working at the polls knew
 
04:05:37.349 --> 04:05:37.359 align:start position:0%
all the laws that are contained in the
 
04:05:40.469 --> 04:05:40.479 align:start position:0%
400 page election law book and the 400
 
04:05:42.950 --> 04:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
page election procedure manual and the
 
04:05:44.870 --> 04:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
content of all the memoranda and
 
04:05:44.880 --> 04:05:46.070 align:start position:0%
content of all the memoranda and
opinions

04:05:46.070 --> 04:05:46.080 align:start position:0%
opinions
 
04:05:48.309 --> 04:05:48.319 align:start position:0%
that are distributed by the secretary of
 
04:05:49.990 --> 04:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
state in the eternal attorney general's
 
04:05:53.189 --> 04:05:53.199 align:start position:0%
office during an election cycle
 
04:05:54.870 --> 04:05:54.880 align:start position:0%
but under this bill
 
04:05:56.389 --> 04:05:56.399 align:start position:0%
they should know all that material
 
04:05:58.150 --> 04:05:58.160 align:start position:0%
because if they make a mistake have an
 
04:06:00.150 --> 04:06:00.160 align:start position:0%
accident or have some other innocent
 
04:06:01.590 --> 04:06:01.600 align:start position:0%
reason for not handling election
 
04:06:04.389 --> 04:06:04.399 align:start position:0%
procedures a hundred percent accurately
 
04:06:07.590 --> 04:06:07.600 align:start position:0%
they could lose their right to vote
 
04:06:09.429 --> 04:06:09.439 align:start position:0%
secretary of state does provide some
 
04:06:11.189 --> 04:06:11.199 align:start position:0%
training to election officials every two
 
04:06:11.199 --> 04:06:12.550 align:start position:0%
training to election officials every two
years

04:06:12.550 --> 04:06:12.560 align:start position:0%
years
 
04:06:14.309 --> 04:06:14.319 align:start position:0%
but that those training sessions are
 
04:06:16.229 --> 04:06:16.239 align:start position:0%
mostly overviews and summaries of
 
04:06:18.550 --> 04:06:18.560 align:start position:0%
changes in election law and procedures
 
04:06:20.550 --> 04:06:20.560 align:start position:0%
they don't get into every nitty gritty
 
04:06:22.150 --> 04:06:22.160 align:start position:0%
detail of what a supervisor the
 
04:06:24.150 --> 04:06:24.160 align:start position:0%
checklist needs to do what a selectmen
 
04:06:27.030 --> 04:06:27.040 align:start position:0%
needs to do what a moderator needs to do
 
04:06:29.910 --> 04:06:29.920 align:start position:0%
or what a ballot clerk needs to do
 
04:06:32.150 --> 04:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
their attorney general's office recruits
 
04:06:33.910 --> 04:06:33.920 align:start position:0%
and then sends representatives out
 
04:06:35.670 --> 04:06:35.680 align:start position:0%
during state elections to examine the
 
04:06:37.590 --> 04:06:37.600 align:start position:0%
polling places see how they're set up
 
04:06:39.349 --> 04:06:39.359 align:start position:0%
and provides them with checklists and
 
04:06:41.830 --> 04:06:41.840 align:start position:0%
worksheets to evaluate what's being done
 
04:06:43.750 --> 04:06:43.760 align:start position:0%
at the polling places
 
04:06:45.189 --> 04:06:45.199 align:start position:0%
but many of these people have less
 
04:06:46.550 --> 04:06:46.560 align:start position:0%
training and experience than the
 
04:06:50.150 --> 04:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:52.710 --> 04:06:52.720 align:start position:0%
and frankly they make mistakes
 
04:06:54.630 --> 04:06:54.640 align:start position:0%
as an example a number of years ago one
 
04:06:56.150 --> 04:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
representative of the attorney general's
 
04:06:58.630 --> 04:06:58.640 align:start position:0%
office came to a polling place in nashua
 
04:07:00.229 --> 04:07:00.239 align:start position:0%
and on that checklist they wrote that
 
04:07:02.790 --> 04:07:02.800 align:start position:0%
there was no american flag outside of
 
04:07:04.710 --> 04:07:04.720 align:start position:0%
the polling place
 
04:07:06.229 --> 04:07:06.239 align:start position:0%
we got a report in nashua that
 
04:07:07.910 --> 04:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
complained about that violation from the
 
04:07:10.309 --> 04:07:10.319 align:start position:0%
attorney general's office well the fact
 
04:07:10.319 --> 04:07:11.110 align:start position:0%
attorney general's office well the fact
is

04:07:11.110 --> 04:07:11.120 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:07:12.950 --> 04:07:12.960 align:start position:0%
there was a flag outside the polling
 
04:07:15.510 --> 04:07:15.520 align:start position:0%
place all the polling places are held in
 
04:07:17.510 --> 04:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
schools in nashua all the schools have
 
04:07:19.429 --> 04:07:19.439 align:start position:0%
flag poles near the entrance and all the
 
04:07:21.670 --> 04:07:21.680 align:start position:0%
flag poles had flags on them someone
 
04:07:23.910 --> 04:07:23.920 align:start position:0%
made a mistake
 
04:07:25.990 --> 04:07:26.000 align:start position:0%
but that checklist under this law could
 
04:07:28.469 --> 04:07:28.479 align:start position:0%
have been used by the attorney general
 
04:07:30.469 --> 04:07:30.479 align:start position:0%
as sufficient documentation to try and
 
04:07:34.870 --> 04:07:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:37.590 --> 04:07:37.600 align:start position:0%
i spent 16 years as a city clerk in
 
04:07:39.510 --> 04:07:39.520 align:start position:0%
nashua running elections and five years
 
04:07:41.349 --> 04:07:41.359 align:start position:0%
before that in the city of manchester as
 
04:07:43.910 --> 04:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
deputy clerk running elections
 
04:07:46.389 --> 04:07:46.399 align:start position:0%
i never had anyone of the hundreds of
 
04:07:49.670 --> 04:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
election officials that i worked with
 
04:07:51.830 --> 04:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
the state's election laws
 
04:07:53.670 --> 04:07:53.680 align:start position:0%
but i can assure you that not all of
 
04:07:55.590 --> 04:07:55.600 align:start position:0%
them came into their positions knowing
 
04:07:57.510 --> 04:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
everything that they needed to know to
 
04:07:59.429 --> 04:07:59.439 align:start position:0%
perform their duties
 
04:08:01.429 --> 04:08:01.439 align:start position:0%
and that some of those people may have
 
04:08:04.469 --> 04:08:04.479 align:start position:0%
inadvertently made some mistakes
 
04:08:06.550 --> 04:08:06.560 align:start position:0%
we don't need a law that's going to take
 
04:08:09.269 --> 04:08:09.279 align:start position:0%
their right or vote away because they
 
04:08:11.110 --> 04:08:11.120 align:start position:0%
made a mistake
 
04:08:12.469 --> 04:08:12.479 align:start position:0%
the proposed amendment is bad
 
04:08:14.870 --> 04:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
legislation the language in the bill is
 
04:08:16.630 --> 04:08:16.640 align:start position:0%
inconsistent with terminology in the
 
04:08:16.640 --> 04:08:18.229 align:start position:0%
inconsistent with terminology in the
constitution

04:08:18.229 --> 04:08:18.239 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
04:08:19.910 --> 04:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
less due process has afforded
 
04:08:21.429 --> 04:08:21.439 align:start position:0%
individuals than is provided for
 
04:08:21.439 --> 04:08:23.110 align:start position:0%
individuals than is provided for
municipalities

04:08:23.110 --> 04:08:23.120 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
04:08:24.790 --> 04:08:24.800 align:start position:0%
many municipalities are already
 
04:08:26.630 --> 04:08:26.640 align:start position:0%
experiencing difficulty in recruiting
 
04:08:28.389 --> 04:08:28.399 align:start position:0%
sufficient numbers of volunteer election
 
04:08:31.110 --> 04:08:31.120 align:start position:0%
officials to staff their polling places
 
04:08:32.870 --> 04:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
and the threats of additional potential
 
04:08:34.870 --> 04:08:34.880 align:start position:0%
litigation of those officials
 
04:08:37.110 --> 04:08:37.120 align:start position:0%
due to a mistake or accident or some
 
04:08:39.750 --> 04:08:39.760 align:start position:0%
other innocent reason is unnecessary and
 
04:08:39.760 --> 04:08:41.349 align:start position:0%
other innocent reason is unnecessary and
counterproductive

04:08:41.349 --> 04:08:41.359 align:start position:0%
counterproductive
 
04:08:43.030 --> 04:08:43.040 align:start position:0%
i would therefore ask that you vote
 
04:08:44.870 --> 04:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
against this report by pressing the red
 
04:08:48.710 --> 04:08:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:50.149 --> 04:08:50.159 align:start position:0%
geo recognizer
 
04:08:55.030 --> 04:08:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:58.469 --> 04:08:58.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:00.389 --> 04:09:00.399 align:start position:0%
this bill is an attempt to provide
 
04:09:02.630 --> 04:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
remedies in regards to misconduct at
 
04:09:04.710 --> 04:09:04.720 align:start position:0%
polling places by election officials let
 
04:09:07.590 --> 04:09:07.600 align:start position:0%
me first address the last points raised
 
04:09:10.550 --> 04:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
by the previous speaker from nashua
 
04:09:13.110 --> 04:09:13.120 align:start position:0%
the reality is the law as you heard and
 
04:09:14.389 --> 04:09:14.399 align:start position:0%
the constitution
 
04:09:17.189 --> 04:09:17.199 align:start position:0%
all already provides that upon a
 
04:09:19.750 --> 04:09:19.760 align:start position:0%
criminal conviction
 
04:09:19.760 --> 04:09:20.469 align:start position:0%
criminal conviction
an

04:09:20.469 --> 04:09:20.479 align:start position:0%
an
 
04:09:23.429 --> 04:09:23.439 align:start position:0%
election official can lose their right
 
04:09:26.469 --> 04:09:26.479 align:start position:0%
to vote as can someone convicted of
 
04:09:28.309 --> 04:09:28.319 align:start position:0%
violation of election law we've all
 
04:09:29.830 --> 04:09:29.840 align:start position:0%
heard of people voting twice in
 
04:09:32.229 --> 04:09:32.239 align:start position:0%
elections they lose their right to vote
 
04:09:34.309 --> 04:09:34.319 align:start position:0%
this is not a new provision
 
04:09:36.790 --> 04:09:36.800 align:start position:0%
and it's not inconsistent
 
04:09:40.790 --> 04:09:40.800 align:start position:0%
this was the provision that the senate
 
04:09:44.389 --> 04:09:44.399 align:start position:0%
when it received the bill from the house
 
04:09:47.389 --> 04:09:47.399 align:start position:0%
placed in the bill and
 
04:09:51.189 --> 04:09:51.199 align:start position:0%
replaced what we had done with the house
 
04:09:53.189 --> 04:09:53.199 align:start position:0%
so the conferees
 
04:09:55.910 --> 04:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
accepted what had been done by the
 
04:09:55.920 --> 04:09:57.030 align:start position:0%
accepted what had been done by the
senate

04:09:57.030 --> 04:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
senate
 
04:09:58.149 --> 04:09:58.159 align:start position:0%
and then
 
04:10:00.550 --> 04:10:00.560 align:start position:0%
added and were able to merge the two
 
04:10:02.550 --> 04:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
with what we had done in this body in
 
04:10:03.830 --> 04:10:03.840 align:start position:0%
the house
 
04:10:06.149 --> 04:10:06.159 align:start position:0%
and this bill is somewhat of an example
 
04:10:07.990 --> 04:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
of something that i think we can all
 
04:10:11.189 --> 04:10:11.199 align:start position:0%
agree we run into when we propose a bill
 
04:10:13.189 --> 04:10:13.199 align:start position:0%
there are certain things that when we
 
04:10:15.429 --> 04:10:15.439 align:start position:0%
propose them in a bill we know we are
 
04:10:18.070 --> 04:10:18.080 align:start position:0%
going to get objection to them
 
04:10:19.990 --> 04:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
one of them is when we have a bill that
 
04:10:23.030 --> 04:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
proposes officials of any kind or any
 
04:10:25.110 --> 04:10:25.120 align:start position:0%
person do more work
 
04:10:27.510 --> 04:10:27.520 align:start position:0%
right in addition to taking
 
04:10:29.990 --> 04:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
these three data points we now want you
 
04:10:31.830 --> 04:10:31.840 align:start position:0%
to take five
 
04:10:33.510 --> 04:10:33.520 align:start position:0%
we know that in our personal life when
 
04:10:35.429 --> 04:10:35.439 align:start position:0%
we have staff and we ask them to do more
 
04:10:36.870 --> 04:10:36.880 align:start position:0%
they don't want to do it
 
04:10:39.429 --> 04:10:39.439 align:start position:0%
so this bill has a little bit of that in
 
04:10:41.910 --> 04:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
it so people didn't like it
 
04:10:44.229 --> 04:10:44.239 align:start position:0%
we also know as the body that we hear
 
04:10:46.309 --> 04:10:46.319 align:start position:0%
all the time when there's anything in a
 
04:10:49.750 --> 04:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
bill in regards to penalties
 
04:10:52.710 --> 04:10:52.720 align:start position:0%
criminal penalties or civil penalties
 
04:10:57.590 --> 04:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:00.229 --> 04:11:00.239 align:start position:0%
and when it involves fines
 
04:11:03.510 --> 04:11:03.520 align:start position:0%
there's even more pushback
 
04:11:06.469 --> 04:11:06.479 align:start position:0%
but at a certain point there needs to be
 
04:11:08.630 --> 04:11:08.640 align:start position:0%
some ability
 
04:11:11.590 --> 04:11:11.600 align:start position:0%
for accountability
 
04:11:13.830 --> 04:11:13.840 align:start position:0%
and in regards to the elections that
 
04:11:16.630 --> 04:11:16.640 align:start position:0%
have been conducted we know now just in
 
04:11:19.590 --> 04:11:19.600 align:start position:0%
the elections in 2020
 
04:11:22.469 --> 04:11:22.479 align:start position:0%
that the communities of bedford laconia
 
04:11:23.910 --> 04:11:23.920 align:start position:0%
and windham
 
04:11:26.149 --> 04:11:26.159 align:start position:0%
had substantial problems with the
 
04:11:28.790 --> 04:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
conduct of their elections
 
04:11:30.149 --> 04:11:30.159 align:start position:0%
due to
 
04:11:33.429 --> 04:11:33.439 align:start position:0%
the performance of people at the polls
 
04:11:36.309 --> 04:11:36.319 align:start position:0%
and some of that performance
 
04:11:39.830 --> 04:11:39.840 align:start position:0%
was in violation of law
 
04:11:43.030 --> 04:11:43.040 align:start position:0%
and contrary to what was sworn to under
 
04:11:43.040 --> 04:11:43.910 align:start position:0%
and contrary to what was sworn to under
oath

04:11:43.910 --> 04:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
oath
 
04:11:45.910 --> 04:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
by some of the workers at the ballot law
 
04:11:45.920 --> 04:11:47.670 align:start position:0%
by some of the workers at the ballot law
commission

04:11:47.670 --> 04:11:47.680 align:start position:0%
commission
 
04:11:49.830 --> 04:11:49.840 align:start position:0%
and no one was held accountable
 
04:11:52.389 --> 04:11:52.399 align:start position:0%
and the state
 
04:11:54.550 --> 04:11:54.560 align:start position:0%
bears the expense of the attorney
 
04:11:56.550 --> 04:11:56.560 align:start position:0%
general's investigation in windham it
 
04:11:59.349 --> 04:11:59.359 align:start position:0%
was an 11-page letter bedford laconia
 
04:12:01.030 --> 04:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
further letters
 
04:12:03.990 --> 04:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
other communities further letters
 
04:12:06.630 --> 04:12:06.640 align:start position:0%
every election there is a stack of
 
04:12:09.110 --> 04:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
letters generated in regards to
 
04:12:10.870 --> 04:12:10.880 align:start position:0%
allegations that things are not done
 
04:12:13.670 --> 04:12:13.680 align:start position:0%
properly at the polls
 
04:12:17.189 --> 04:12:17.199 align:start position:0%
at a certain point we need to say to the
 
04:12:19.670 --> 04:12:19.680 align:start position:0%
persons casting the ballots there will
 
04:12:22.070 --> 04:12:22.080 align:start position:0%
be accountability for making sure that
 
04:12:24.149 --> 04:12:24.159 align:start position:0%
job is done right
 
04:12:27.910 --> 04:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
and that's what 1567 seeks to do
 
04:12:30.309 --> 04:12:30.319 align:start position:0%
in a conversation with the enforcing
 
04:12:32.710 --> 04:12:32.720 align:start position:0%
agency of our election laws attorney
 
04:12:34.630 --> 04:12:34.640 align:start position:0%
general's the question was made why
 
04:12:36.309 --> 04:12:36.319 align:start position:0%
isn't there i made the question why
 
04:12:37.830 --> 04:12:37.840 align:start position:0%
isn't there anything ever done about
 
04:12:40.469 --> 04:12:40.479 align:start position:0%
this i have an 11-page letter why isn't
 
04:12:42.550 --> 04:12:42.560 align:start position:0%
anything being done
 
04:12:44.389 --> 04:12:44.399 align:start position:0%
because the reality of getting a
 
04:12:48.309 --> 04:12:48.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:51.429 --> 04:12:51.439 align:start position:0%
is that it is very hard to do
 
04:12:53.429 --> 04:12:53.439 align:start position:0%
no one wants to find people criminally
 
04:12:53.439 --> 04:12:54.870 align:start position:0%
no one wants to find people criminally
liable

04:12:54.870 --> 04:12:54.880 align:start position:0%
liable
 
04:12:56.790 --> 04:12:56.800 align:start position:0%
if they didn't understand what they were
 
04:12:59.269 --> 04:12:59.279 align:start position:0%
doing but at a certain point people in
 
04:13:01.349 --> 04:13:01.359 align:start position:0%
our community need to be responsible for
 
04:13:03.590 --> 04:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
making sure jobs are done correctly as a
 
04:13:05.349 --> 04:13:05.359 align:start position:0%
former member of the board of selectmen
 
04:13:07.110 --> 04:13:07.120 align:start position:0%
i was required to be at the polls all
 
04:13:07.120 --> 04:13:08.790 align:start position:0%
i was required to be at the polls all
day

04:13:08.790 --> 04:13:08.800 align:start position:0%
day
 
04:13:12.950 --> 04:13:12.960 align:start position:0%
my signature went on the tape on the box
 
04:13:15.590 --> 04:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
i there was some responsibility given to
 
04:13:17.750 --> 04:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
me by the voters of goffstown to ensure
 
04:13:20.469 --> 04:13:20.479 align:start position:0%
that the election was done properly
 
04:13:22.590 --> 04:13:22.600 align:start position:0%
and what we are finding is is that in
 
04:13:24.790 --> 04:13:24.800 align:start position:0%
municipalities there is simply no one
 
04:13:26.229 --> 04:13:26.239 align:start position:0%
stepping to the plate to take
 
04:13:26.239 --> 04:13:28.070 align:start position:0%
stepping to the plate to take
responsibility

04:13:28.070 --> 04:13:28.080 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
04:13:31.110 --> 04:13:31.120 align:start position:0%
so how do we get them to do that well
 
04:13:34.950 --> 04:13:34.960 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the answer is
 
04:13:37.590 --> 04:13:37.600 align:start position:0%
you suggest that they might be fined
 
04:13:39.510 --> 04:13:39.520 align:start position:0%
you give the attorney general's office
 
04:13:41.990 --> 04:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
the ability to seek penalties that does
 
04:13:45.189 --> 04:13:45.199 align:start position:0%
not require a criminal conviction
 
04:13:47.830 --> 04:13:47.840 align:start position:0%
because they are reluctant to begin that
 
04:13:50.229 --> 04:13:50.239 align:start position:0%
process for the time expense and
 
04:13:52.870 --> 04:13:52.880 align:start position:0%
likelihood the most important thing
 
04:13:54.469 --> 04:13:54.479 align:start position:0%
is to make sure our elections are
 
04:13:57.030 --> 04:13:57.040 align:start position:0%
conducted properly and all legal ballots
 
04:13:59.189 --> 04:13:59.199 align:start position:0%
are counted properly
 
04:14:01.110 --> 04:14:01.120 align:start position:0%
and we get there by making sure the
 
04:14:02.550 --> 04:14:02.560 align:start position:0%
people that are there are doing their
 
04:14:04.389 --> 04:14:04.399 align:start position:0%
job i have no dispute with the
 
04:14:07.910 --> 04:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
representative from nashua who i i hold
 
04:14:10.309 --> 04:14:10.319 align:start position:0%
great admiration for in his at in his
 
04:14:12.229 --> 04:14:12.239 align:start position:0%
administration of our election laws and
 
04:14:14.229 --> 04:14:14.239 align:start position:0%
and knowledge of them but what i'm
 
04:14:16.229 --> 04:14:16.239 align:start position:0%
talking about is the administration of
 
04:14:18.309 --> 04:14:18.319 align:start position:0%
laws and the people who are working
 
04:14:21.030 --> 04:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
there and if you are choosing to be a
 
04:14:22.950 --> 04:14:22.960 align:start position:0%
part of this process
 
04:14:25.990 --> 04:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
i am simply asking them in this bill
 
04:14:28.710 --> 04:14:28.720 align:start position:0%
on behalf of my constituents to pay
 
04:14:28.720 --> 04:14:30.070 align:start position:0%
on behalf of my constituents to pay
attention

04:14:30.070 --> 04:14:30.080 align:start position:0%
attention
 
04:14:32.229 --> 04:14:32.239 align:start position:0%
to make sure it's done right
 
04:14:34.870 --> 04:14:34.880 align:start position:0%
and maybe next time when a community
 
04:14:39.110 --> 04:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
gets a letter that's 11 pages long
 
04:14:41.670 --> 04:14:41.680 align:start position:0%
in regards to what was done wrong
 
04:14:43.590 --> 04:14:43.600 align:start position:0%
they won't simply say
 
04:14:44.950 --> 04:14:44.960 align:start position:0%
oh well
 
04:14:46.550 --> 04:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
you want to come and monitor our next
 
04:14:48.710 --> 04:14:48.720 align:start position:0%
election fine
 
04:14:51.269 --> 04:14:51.279 align:start position:0%
maybe next time the community will do
 
04:14:53.269 --> 04:14:53.279 align:start position:0%
something this bill is not about
 
04:14:55.429 --> 04:14:55.439 align:start position:0%
collecting fines or penalties or taking
 
04:14:57.429 --> 04:14:57.439 align:start position:0%
away anybody's right to vote
 
04:14:59.750 --> 04:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
it's about communicating that we all
 
04:15:03.750 --> 04:15:03.760 align:start position:0%
have a responsibility in our elections
 
04:15:06.790 --> 04:15:06.800 align:start position:0%
and we need to give everyone the tools
 
04:15:08.790 --> 04:15:08.800 align:start position:0%
to know what they're supposed to do and
 
04:15:10.950 --> 04:15:10.960 align:start position:0%
to be able to enforce them
 
04:15:12.790 --> 04:15:12.800 align:start position:0%

04:15:12.800 --> 04:15:14.550 align:start position:0%
thank you does the member yield to

04:15:14.550 --> 04:15:14.560 align:start position:0%

yield
 
04:15:20.469 --> 04:15:20.479 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is the committee
 
04:15:27.030 --> 04:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:29.349 --> 04:15:29.359 align:start position:0%
a roll call has been requested by
 
04:15:31.030 --> 04:15:31.040 align:start position:0%
representative o'brien is that
 
04:15:33.269 --> 04:15:33.279 align:start position:0%
sufficiently seconded
 
04:15:35.269 --> 04:15:35.279 align:start position:0%
it is sufficiently seconded this will be
 
04:15:36.870 --> 04:15:36.880 align:start position:0%
a roll call vote
 
04:16:39.189 --> 04:16:39.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:41.670 --> 04:16:41.680 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is the committee of
 
04:16:45.510 --> 04:16:45.520 align:start position:0%
conference reporter in hb 1567
 
04:16:49.429 --> 04:16:49.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:51.110 --> 04:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
 
04:16:57.110 --> 04:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:59.189 --> 04:16:59.199 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
04:17:01.429 --> 04:17:01.439 align:start position:0%
if i know the terms used in the proposed
 
04:17:03.670 --> 04:17:03.680 align:start position:0%
law are in conflict conflict with
 
04:17:06.550 --> 04:17:06.560 align:start position:0%
terminology in the state constitution
 
04:17:08.070 --> 04:17:08.080 align:start position:0%
and if i know that many of the people
 
04:17:09.590 --> 04:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
recruited by the attorney general's
 
04:17:11.030 --> 04:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
office to conduct polling site
 
04:17:13.429 --> 04:17:13.439 align:start position:0%
inspections on election day have less
 
04:17:14.790 --> 04:17:14.800 align:start position:0%
training and experience than the
 
04:17:17.670 --> 04:17:17.680 align:start position:0%
election officials working at the polls
 
04:17:19.830 --> 04:17:19.840 align:start position:0%
and if i know that his existing law
 
04:17:21.429 --> 04:17:21.439 align:start position:0%
provides that someone who knowingly
 
04:17:23.830 --> 04:17:23.840 align:start position:0%
fails to perform his duties is guilty of
 
04:17:25.830 --> 04:17:25.840 align:start position:0%
a misdemeanor and that our state
 
04:17:27.670 --> 04:17:27.680 align:start position:0%
constitution provides that someone who
 
04:17:29.510 --> 04:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
willfully violates the election laws of
 
04:17:32.229 --> 04:17:32.239 align:start position:0%
the state can lose his right to vote and
 
04:17:34.149 --> 04:17:34.159 align:start position:0%
that therefore this proposed law is
 
04:17:36.630 --> 04:17:36.640 align:start position:0%
unnecessary would i then press the red
 
04:17:38.630 --> 04:17:38.640 align:start position:0%
no button to reject the committee of
 
04:17:41.590 --> 04:17:41.600 align:start position:0%
conference report thank you
 
04:17:43.030 --> 04:17:43.040 align:start position:0%
chair i recognize representative barbara
 
04:17:45.670 --> 04:17:45.680 align:start position:0%
griffin for parliamentary inquiry
 
04:17:47.349 --> 04:17:47.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
04:17:50.550 --> 04:17:50.560 align:start position:0%
if i know that our election officials do
 
04:17:52.870 --> 04:17:52.880 align:start position:0%
great work and the best that they can
 
04:17:55.030 --> 04:17:55.040 align:start position:0%
and that they deserve the support and
 
04:17:57.110 --> 04:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
attention of our communities
 
04:17:59.189 --> 04:17:59.199 align:start position:0%
and their boards of selectmen and town
 
04:18:01.750 --> 04:18:01.760 align:start position:0%
councils and aldermen
 
04:18:03.830 --> 04:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
and if i know that there are repeated
 
04:18:06.790 --> 04:18:06.800 align:start position:0%
instances unfortunately of communities
 
04:18:08.710 --> 04:18:08.720 align:start position:0%
where ballots are not being properly
 
04:18:11.750 --> 04:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
handled and the ability to do follow-up
 
04:18:14.229 --> 04:18:14.239 align:start position:0%
and attention to those issues has been
 
04:18:16.950 --> 04:18:16.960 align:start position:0%
limited based on the
 
04:18:16.960 --> 04:18:18.229 align:start position:0%
limited based on the
constraints

04:18:18.229 --> 04:18:18.239 align:start position:0%
constraints
 
04:18:20.070 --> 04:18:20.080 align:start position:0%
for the attorney general and what can be
 
04:18:22.149 --> 04:18:22.159 align:start position:0%
done in current statute
 
04:18:23.750 --> 04:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
and if i know that the current
 
04:18:26.149 --> 04:18:26.159 align:start position:0%
provisions in statute relate only to
 
04:18:28.870 --> 04:18:28.880 align:start position:0%
criminal conduct with the ag has
 
04:18:31.590 --> 04:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
informed us is difficult to prove and
 
04:18:35.189 --> 04:18:35.199 align:start position:0%
leaves no recourse for certain civil
 
04:18:35.199 --> 04:18:36.229 align:start position:0%
leaves no recourse for certain civil
errors

04:18:36.229 --> 04:18:36.239 align:start position:0%
errors
 
04:18:38.630 --> 04:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
and that those investigations or costs
 
04:18:41.349 --> 04:18:41.359 align:start position:0%
that the entire state bears both in
 
04:18:43.590 --> 04:18:43.600 align:start position:0%
finances and in the integrity of our
 
04:18:46.149 --> 04:18:46.159 align:start position:0%
elections would i now press the green
 
04:18:48.870 --> 04:18:48.880 align:start position:0%

to print the remarks of 1431.
 
04:20:51.830 --> 04:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
this will be a division vote members
 
04:21:32.870 --> 04:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:36.389 --> 04:21:36.399 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is to print the
 
04:21:38.229 --> 04:21:38.239 align:start position:0%
remarks of the previous debate in a
 
04:21:50.070 --> 04:21:50.080 align:start position:0%

04:21:57.110 --> 04:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
again the motion before us is to print
 
04:21:59.990 --> 04:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
the remarks on the debate on 1431 in the

thank you mr speaker
 
04:22:17.750 --> 04:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
this committee report is a
 
04:22:21.349 --> 04:22:21.359 align:start position:0%
monster of a bill with 79 sections
 
04:22:23.670 --> 04:22:23.680 align:start position:0%
i'll highlight a couple for you
 
04:22:26.229 --> 04:22:26.239 align:start position:0%
section 78 and 79 of this bill
 
04:22:28.149 --> 04:22:28.159 align:start position:0%
deal with financial investments and
 
04:22:28.159 --> 04:22:29.349 align:start position:0%
deal with financial investments and
incentives

04:22:29.349 --> 04:22:29.359 align:start position:0%
incentives
 
04:22:32.070 --> 04:22:32.080 align:start position:0%
for affordable housing development by
 
04:22:32.080 --> 04:22:33.510 align:start position:0%
for affordable housing development by
municipalities

04:22:33.510 --> 04:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
04:22:35.750 --> 04:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
what this bill attempts to do is change
 
04:22:38.389 --> 04:22:38.399 align:start position:0%
the definition of public use
 
04:22:41.030 --> 04:22:41.040 align:start position:0%
to encourage local municipalities to buy
 
04:22:43.670 --> 04:22:43.680 align:start position:0%
land for housing or actually get in the
 
04:22:45.910 --> 04:22:45.920 align:start position:0%
business of building apartments that's a
 
04:22:47.510 --> 04:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
terrible idea
 
04:22:49.590 --> 04:22:49.600 align:start position:0%
why on earth would think government is
 
04:22:51.510 --> 04:22:51.520 align:start position:0%
the answer to the housing problem
 
04:22:53.429 --> 04:22:53.439 align:start position:0%
government causes the problem in many
 
04:22:55.670 --> 04:22:55.680 align:start position:0%
instances through onerous zoning
 
04:22:57.910 --> 04:22:57.920 align:start position:0%
regulations unreasonable wetlands
 
04:23:01.030 --> 04:23:01.040 align:start position:0%
restrictions expensive fire sprinklers a
 
04:23:03.910 --> 04:23:03.920 align:start position:0%
lengthy approval and permitting process
 
04:23:05.590 --> 04:23:05.600 align:start position:0%
and myriad more intrusions on the
 
04:23:08.309 --> 04:23:08.319 align:start position:0%
marketplace that lead to the shortage of
 
04:23:10.630 --> 04:23:10.640 align:start position:0%
inventory we have
 
04:23:13.429 --> 04:23:13.439 align:start position:0%
workforce housing is a misnomer it's
 
04:23:15.429 --> 04:23:15.439 align:start position:0%
just housing if high-end luxury
 
04:23:17.590 --> 04:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
apartments are built
 
04:23:19.510 --> 04:23:19.520 align:start position:0%
higher income tenants will move to the
 
04:23:21.510 --> 04:23:21.520 align:start position:0%
move out of the old drafty noisy
 
04:23:24.790 --> 04:23:24.800 align:start position:0%
buildings into the nice fancy new ones
 
04:23:26.389 --> 04:23:26.399 align:start position:0%
thereby providing more available and
 
04:23:28.710 --> 04:23:28.720 align:start position:0%
affordable housing in the vacating units
 
04:23:31.670 --> 04:23:31.680 align:start position:0%
it's simple supply and demand
 
04:23:34.070 --> 04:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
the market needs more supply right now
 
04:23:36.469 --> 04:23:36.479 align:start position:0%
so what we need to do is get state and
 
04:23:38.469 --> 04:23:38.479 align:start position:0%
town bureaucracies and regulations out
 
04:23:40.870 --> 04:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
of the way that is the solution not
 
04:23:42.469 --> 04:23:42.479 align:start position:0%
giving more money and powers to
 
04:23:42.479 --> 04:23:44.149 align:start position:0%
giving more money and powers to
government

04:23:44.149 --> 04:23:44.159 align:start position:0%
government
 
04:23:46.149 --> 04:23:46.159 align:start position:0%
by giving towns the authoritarian
 
04:23:51.110 --> 04:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
ability to acquire land for or build
 
04:23:51.120 --> 04:23:52.229 align:start position:0%
ability to acquire land for or build
housing

04:23:52.229 --> 04:23:52.239 align:start position:0%
housing
 
04:23:54.389 --> 04:23:54.399 align:start position:0%
you're not only spitting in the faces of
 
04:23:57.269 --> 04:23:57.279 align:start position:0%
private sector developers and investors
 
04:23:59.269 --> 04:23:59.279 align:start position:0%
who already took the risks raised
 
04:24:01.349 --> 04:24:01.359 align:start position:0%
capital and jumped through all the hoops
 
04:24:03.189 --> 04:24:03.199 align:start position:0%
but didn't get subsidies
 
04:24:05.189 --> 04:24:05.199 align:start position:0%
but you're also perverting the idea of
 
04:24:06.630 --> 04:24:06.640 align:start position:0%
public use
 
04:24:09.269 --> 04:24:09.279 align:start position:0%
that is meant for things like utilities
 
04:24:12.630 --> 04:24:12.640 align:start position:0%
roads parks and recreational areas
 
04:24:15.030 --> 04:24:15.040 align:start position:0%
town buildings and schools
 
04:24:17.830 --> 04:24:17.840 align:start position:0%
when local governments become developers
 
04:24:20.229 --> 04:24:20.239 align:start position:0%
it invariably leads to even more
 
04:24:20.239 --> 04:24:21.510 align:start position:0%
it invariably leads to even more
cronyism

04:24:21.510 --> 04:24:21.520 align:start position:0%
cronyism
 
04:24:24.229 --> 04:24:24.239 align:start position:0%
insider trading corporate greed and
 
04:24:24.239 --> 04:24:25.510 align:start position:0%
insider trading corporate greed and
graft

04:24:25.510 --> 04:24:25.520 align:start position:0%
graft
 
04:24:27.990 --> 04:24:28.000 align:start position:0%
without market risks and pricing signals
 
04:24:30.149 --> 04:24:30.159 align:start position:0%
government projects always cost more
 
04:24:32.790 --> 04:24:32.800 align:start position:0%
than projected and take longer than
 
04:24:35.349 --> 04:24:35.359 align:start position:0%
promised and the taxpayers are the
 
04:24:35.359 --> 04:24:36.870 align:start position:0%
promised and the taxpayers are the
victims

04:24:36.870 --> 04:24:36.880 align:start position:0%
victims
 
04:24:39.030 --> 04:24:39.040 align:start position:0%
nobody in this body should endorse more
 
04:24:41.590 --> 04:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
public housing product projects which is
 
04:24:42.790 --> 04:24:42.800 align:start position:0%
what we're going to get with this
 
04:24:46.229 --> 04:24:46.239 align:start position:0%
ill-conceived legislation
 
04:24:47.750 --> 04:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
another section of the proposed
 
04:24:50.550 --> 04:24:50.560 align:start position:0%
legislation has to do with lead hazards
 
04:24:52.469 --> 04:24:52.479 align:start position:0%
in residential units
 
04:24:54.550 --> 04:24:54.560 align:start position:0%
this bill drastically lowers the
 
04:24:57.750 --> 04:24:57.760 align:start position:0%
threshold by which dhhs can swoop in and
 
04:25:00.149 --> 04:25:00.159 align:start position:0%
force a landlord or property owner to a
 
04:25:02.070 --> 04:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
bait lead in a residential unit
 
04:25:05.110 --> 04:25:05.120 align:start position:0%
regardless of where the child contracted
 
04:25:07.590 --> 04:25:07.600 align:start position:0%
or ate or ingested the lead
 
04:25:09.990 --> 04:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
the actual source could be at school or
 
04:25:12.790 --> 04:25:12.800 align:start position:0%
in daycare or grandma's house or eating
 
04:25:12.800 --> 04:25:13.990 align:start position:0%
in daycare or grandma's house or eating
toys

04:25:13.990 --> 04:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
toys
 
04:25:16.469 --> 04:25:16.479 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with the living unit
 
04:25:17.990 --> 04:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
the problem here is that the property
 
04:25:19.830 --> 04:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
owner could be forced to spend tens of
 
04:25:22.229 --> 04:25:22.239 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars on abatement even
 
04:25:25.189 --> 04:25:25.199 align:start position:0%
when the housing unit isn't the cause
 
04:25:27.510 --> 04:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
abatement orders are a gigantic expense
 
04:25:29.429 --> 04:25:29.439 align:start position:0%
for property owners ultimately leading
 
04:25:31.349 --> 04:25:31.359 align:start position:0%
to higher rents and less affordable
 
04:25:33.110 --> 04:25:33.120 align:start position:0%
housing if that's what you want that's
 
04:25:35.510 --> 04:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
what you're going to get with this bill
 
04:25:38.229 --> 04:25:38.239 align:start position:0%
nobody is arguing that lead poisoning
 
04:25:40.389 --> 04:25:40.399 align:start position:0%
isn't a very serious problem
 
04:25:42.269 --> 04:25:42.279 align:start position:0%
we all know that but this
 
04:25:44.630 --> 04:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
one-size-fits-all legislation is not the
 
04:25:44.640 --> 04:25:45.670 align:start position:0%
one-size-fits-all legislation is not the
answer

04:25:45.670 --> 04:25:45.680 align:start position:0%
answer
 
04:25:47.429 --> 04:25:47.439 align:start position:0%
it's more feel-good legislation that
 
04:25:50.469 --> 04:25:50.479 align:start position:0%
will cause more problems than it fixes
 
04:25:53.110 --> 04:25:53.120 align:start position:0%
for these reasons i'm a big red button
 
04:25:55.349 --> 04:25:55.359 align:start position:0%
no on this bill and i hope the
 
04:25:57.590 --> 04:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
independent thinkers in this body will
 
04:25:59.349 --> 04:25:59.359 align:start position:0%
join me
 
04:26:01.349 --> 04:26:01.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
04:26:11.910 --> 04:26:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:13.110 --> 04:26:13.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:26:17.590 --> 04:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:21.990 --> 04:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:22.000 --> 04:26:23.269 align:start position:0%
 
welcome

04:26:23.269 --> 04:26:23.279 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
04:26:30.469 --> 04:26:30.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:33.269 --> 04:26:33.279 align:start position:0%
mr speaker
 
04:26:37.510 --> 04:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
house bill 1661 has had 16 and now i
 
04:26:39.670 --> 04:26:39.680 align:start position:0%
heard it only has 10
 
04:26:44.870 --> 04:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:47.110 --> 04:26:47.120 align:start position:0%
we've always voted against these ominous
 
04:26:47.120 --> 04:26:49.510 align:start position:0%
we've always voted against these ominous
bills

04:26:49.510 --> 04:26:49.520 align:start position:0%
bills
 
04:26:55.750 --> 04:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:57.990 --> 04:26:58.000 align:start position:0%
so let me get house will be in order
 
04:27:00.070 --> 04:27:00.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
04:27:02.229 --> 04:27:02.239 align:start position:0%
so let me get down to the crutch that i
 
04:27:06.070 --> 04:27:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:10.110 --> 04:27:10.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:12.630 --> 04:27:12.640 align:start position:0%
9.35 million dollars is going to go to
 
04:27:14.710 --> 04:27:14.720 align:start position:0%
that parking garage
 
04:27:16.710 --> 04:27:16.720 align:start position:0%
let me explain some of it
 
04:27:20.229 --> 04:27:20.239 align:start position:0%
and you tell me if this sounds right
 
04:27:23.349 --> 04:27:23.359 align:start position:0%
design and engineer of a 450 space
 
04:27:25.349 --> 04:27:25.359 align:start position:0%
parking garage is going to be 1.4
 
04:27:27.750 --> 04:27:27.760 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
04:27:30.710 --> 04:27:30.720 align:start position:0%
not one brick is going to be laid
 
04:27:32.870 --> 04:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
but 1.4 million just to draw it on a
 
04:27:37.030 --> 04:27:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:40.469 --> 04:27:40.479 align:start position:0%
design and engineer cost to demolish
 
04:27:43.269 --> 04:27:43.279 align:start position:0%
store street garage is 1.5
 
04:27:47.429 --> 04:27:47.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:49.110 --> 04:27:49.120 align:start position:0%
just to draw it on a piece of paper how
 
04:27:50.950 --> 04:27:50.960 align:start position:0%
they're going to tear the thing down a
 
04:27:55.030 --> 04:27:55.040 align:start position:0%
hundred and five thousand dollars
 
04:27:56.870 --> 04:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
and then thirty five thousand dollars is
 
04:27:58.870 --> 04:27:58.880 align:start position:0%
going to go to demolish just to draw on
 
04:28:01.990 --> 04:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
a piece of paper demolish the dog ga
 
04:28:03.990 --> 04:28:04.000 align:start position:0%
building over there
 
04:28:04.000 --> 04:28:04.950 align:start position:0%
building over there
um

04:28:04.950 --> 04:28:04.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:28:08.469 --> 04:28:08.479 align:start position:0%
25 000 i don't understand this one to
 
04:28:10.870 --> 04:28:10.880 align:start position:0%
abandon capital street so i'm assuming
 
04:28:12.870 --> 04:28:12.880 align:start position:0%
they're going to close a street but it
 
04:28:15.510 --> 04:28:15.520 align:start position:0%
costs 25 000 to put up
 
04:28:17.670 --> 04:28:17.680 align:start position:0%
a couple do not enter signs
 
04:28:21.510 --> 04:28:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:24.229 --> 04:28:24.239 align:start position:0%
so now here comes the good part
 
04:28:29.030 --> 04:28:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:31.830 --> 04:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
cost of demolition of the bill doj
 
04:28:34.830 --> 04:28:34.840 align:start position:0%
building is going to be 1.1 million
 
04:28:39.750 --> 04:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:45.110 --> 04:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
of the doj prep site is 535 000
 
04:28:47.910 --> 04:28:47.920 align:start position:0%
just to level the dirt out once the
 
04:28:50.070 --> 04:28:50.080 align:start position:0%
building's gone probably throw a little
 
04:28:52.510 --> 04:28:52.520 align:start position:0%
grass seed down
 
04:28:55.030 --> 04:28:55.040 align:start position:0%
535 dollars
 
04:28:57.349 --> 04:28:57.359 align:start position:0%
now this is one that really gets me and
 
04:28:59.349 --> 04:28:59.359 align:start position:0%
i'm going to help here
 
04:29:02.469 --> 04:29:02.479 align:start position:0%
cost to move the department of justice
 
04:29:03.990 --> 04:29:04.000 align:start position:0%
i guess down by where the j or the
 
04:29:06.349 --> 04:29:06.359 align:start position:0%
prison is
 
04:29:09.830 --> 04:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
1.2 million dollars
 
04:29:12.149 --> 04:29:12.159 align:start position:0%
mr speaker i'll tell you right now i'll
 
04:29:16.710 --> 04:29:16.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:18.550 --> 04:29:18.560 align:start position:0%
because that's a lot of money to move
 
04:29:20.630 --> 04:29:20.640 align:start position:0%
some desk
 
04:29:22.389 --> 04:29:22.399 align:start position:0%
approximate cost
 
04:29:24.950 --> 04:29:24.960 align:start position:0%
for a 50 000 square foot because i heard
 
04:29:26.630 --> 04:29:26.640 align:start position:0%
the building they're going to
 
04:29:29.189 --> 04:29:29.199 align:start position:0%
the ag is going to is huge so they're
 
04:29:32.149 --> 04:29:32.159 align:start position:0%
going to have 50 000 square feet of it
 
04:29:32.159 --> 04:29:33.429 align:start position:0%
going to have 50 000 square feet of it
renovated

04:29:33.429 --> 04:29:33.439 align:start position:0%
renovated
 
04:29:35.189 --> 04:29:35.199 align:start position:0%
to accommodate
 
04:29:40.550 --> 04:29:40.560 align:start position:0%
the ag at a cost of 3.7 million dollars
 
04:29:41.830 --> 04:29:41.840 align:start position:0%
and then
 
04:29:43.910 --> 04:29:43.920 align:start position:0%
to lease the building
 
04:29:46.389 --> 04:29:46.399 align:start position:0%
is going to be 1.2 million dollars a
 
04:29:46.399 --> 04:29:48.469 align:start position:0%
is going to be 1.2 million dollars a
year

04:29:48.469 --> 04:29:48.479 align:start position:0%
year
 
04:29:50.630 --> 04:29:50.640 align:start position:0%
a hundred thousand dollars a month i'm
 
04:29:52.469 --> 04:29:52.479 align:start position:0%
wondering whose friend is getting rich
 
04:29:55.670 --> 04:29:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:58.070 --> 04:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
so representative
 
04:30:00.870 --> 04:30:00.880 align:start position:0%
that was out of line
 
04:30:06.469 --> 04:30:06.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:07.830 --> 04:30:07.840 align:start position:0%
the member will
 
04:30:11.110 --> 04:30:11.120 align:start position:0%
conduct himself properly before making
 
04:30:14.550 --> 04:30:14.560 align:start position:0%
accusations that have no merit all right
 
04:30:16.309 --> 04:30:16.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
04:30:18.710 --> 04:30:18.720 align:start position:0%
i was thinking the same thing myself
 
04:30:26.229 --> 04:30:26.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:29.110 --> 04:30:29.120 align:start position:0%
so lastly mr speaker
 
04:30:31.590 --> 04:30:31.600 align:start position:0%
what message is this send in
 
04:30:34.950 --> 04:30:34.960 align:start position:0%
with gas heading to six dollars a gallon
 
04:30:37.110 --> 04:30:37.120 align:start position:0%
someone has to stand up and represent
 
04:30:39.189 --> 04:30:39.199 align:start position:0%
the hard-working families and seniors of
 
04:30:41.590 --> 04:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
new hampshire mr speaker that's going to
 
04:30:46.149 --> 04:30:46.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:49.349 --> 04:30:49.359 align:start position:0%
we at this time mr speaker do not need a
 
04:30:52.309 --> 04:30:52.319 align:start position:0%
35 million dollar parking garage so
 
04:30:54.830 --> 04:30:54.840 align:start position:0%
representatives can save a two block
 
04:30:58.149 --> 04:30:58.159 align:start position:0%
walk that's right mr speaker this 35
 
04:30:59.830 --> 04:30:59.840 align:start position:0%
million dollar legislative parking
 
04:31:03.030 --> 04:31:03.040 align:start position:0%
garage with fancy granite faced pillars
 
04:31:06.389 --> 04:31:06.399 align:start position:0%
will save us about two blocks of walk-in
 
04:31:08.950 --> 04:31:08.960 align:start position:0%
mr speaker i am speaking strictly for
 
04:31:13.349 --> 04:31:13.359 align:start position:0%
myself i need those two blocks
 
04:31:16.630 --> 04:31:16.640 align:start position:0%
if we have all this extra money kicking
 
04:31:19.670 --> 04:31:19.680 align:start position:0%
around mr speaker we should
 
04:31:22.309 --> 04:31:22.319 align:start position:0%
give every residential homeowner a four
 
04:31:24.550 --> 04:31:24.560 align:start position:0%
or five hundred dollar gift card instead
 
04:31:27.910 --> 04:31:27.920 align:start position:0%
of spending 9.3 million dollars to prep
 
04:31:30.189 --> 04:31:30.199 align:start position:0%
and design this
 
04:31:33.429 --> 04:31:33.439 align:start position:0%
450 car parking garage before even one
 
04:31:35.910 --> 04:31:35.920 align:start position:0%
brick is laid
 
04:31:38.550 --> 04:31:38.560 align:start position:0%
and not and that's not even included in
 
04:31:41.030 --> 04:31:41.040 align:start position:0%
the tens of millions and mr speaker i
 
04:31:43.510 --> 04:31:43.520 align:start position:0%
mean tens of millions of dollars that
 
04:31:45.349 --> 04:31:45.359 align:start position:0%
was added into this
 
04:31:48.469 --> 04:31:48.479 align:start position:0%
uh pet project that we added into house
 
04:31:50.710 --> 04:31:50.720 align:start position:0%
bill 1661.
 
04:31:54.070 --> 04:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
just like washington dc does to us
 
04:32:00.149 --> 04:32:00.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:03.110 --> 04:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
lastly mr speaker
 
04:32:05.189 --> 04:32:05.199 align:start position:0%
when it comes to this washington dc
 
04:32:06.630 --> 04:32:06.640 align:start position:0%
style pork
 
04:32:08.710 --> 04:32:08.720 align:start position:0%
that was added into this new hampshire
 
04:32:11.830 --> 04:32:11.840 align:start position:0%
35 million dollar parking garage i only
 
04:32:15.030 --> 04:32:15.040 align:start position:0%
have a few words
 
04:32:21.990 --> 04:32:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:25.429 --> 04:32:25.439 align:start position:0%
does a member yield to questions
 
04:32:29.189 --> 04:32:29.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:42.630 --> 04:32:42.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:44.070 --> 04:32:44.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
04:32:46.790 --> 04:32:46.800 align:start position:0%
let me start off with apologizing for
 
04:32:49.269 --> 04:32:49.279 align:start position:0%
confusing my entitlement programs
 
04:32:51.590 --> 04:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
there's so many that it's really hard to
 
04:32:53.110 --> 04:32:53.120 align:start position:0%
keep track of but
 
04:32:57.110 --> 04:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
i i know that when my my tax my paycheck
 
04:32:58.950 --> 04:32:58.960 align:start position:0%
came through it had this fica on it and
 
04:33:01.429 --> 04:33:01.439 align:start position:0%
i was like confused as to what it was
 
04:33:01.439 --> 04:33:02.710 align:start position:0%
i was like confused as to what it was
and

04:33:02.710 --> 04:33:02.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:33:04.709 --> 04:33:04.719 align:start position:0%
it didn't say medicare medicaid social
 
04:33:06.310 --> 04:33:06.320 align:start position:0%
security and all that
 
04:33:06.320 --> 04:33:07.349 align:start position:0%
security and all that
so

04:33:07.349 --> 04:33:07.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:33:10.949 --> 04:33:10.959 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:12.949 --> 04:33:12.959 align:start position:0%
we have
 
04:33:14.869 --> 04:33:14.879 align:start position:0%
a problem with
 
04:33:14.879 --> 04:33:16.629 align:start position:0%
a problem with
housing

04:33:16.629 --> 04:33:16.639 align:start position:0%
housing
 
04:33:17.910 --> 04:33:17.920 align:start position:0%
there aren't enough
 
04:33:19.990 --> 04:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
rental units
 
04:33:21.990 --> 04:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
there's a tremendous problem and we're
 
04:33:23.830 --> 04:33:23.840 align:start position:0%
going to make it worse with this and yes
 
04:33:26.070 --> 04:33:26.080 align:start position:0%
i'm speaking about the
 
04:33:28.310 --> 04:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
lead paint poisoning prevention and
 
04:33:28.320 --> 04:33:29.429 align:start position:0%
lead paint poisoning prevention and
control

04:33:29.429 --> 04:33:29.439 align:start position:0%
control
 
04:33:31.189 --> 04:33:31.199 align:start position:0%
this has to do with the investigation
 
04:33:34.310 --> 04:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
what this section 29 does
 
04:33:34.320 --> 04:33:35.990 align:start position:0%
what this section 29 does
is

04:33:35.990 --> 04:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:33:38.629 --> 04:33:38.639 align:start position:0%
it strikes a part where two tests are
 
04:33:38.639 --> 04:33:40.150 align:start position:0%
it strikes a part where two tests are
required

04:33:40.150 --> 04:33:40.160 align:start position:0%
required
 
04:33:44.629 --> 04:33:44.639 align:start position:0%
so currently as i understand it
 
04:33:46.709 --> 04:33:46.719 align:start position:0%
first test
 
04:33:49.269 --> 04:33:49.279 align:start position:0%
would signal that there's a problem
 
04:33:49.279 --> 04:33:50.230 align:start position:0%
would signal that there's a problem
and

04:33:50.230 --> 04:33:50.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:33:52.230 --> 04:33:52.240 align:start position:0%
investigation would be done to try and
 
04:33:55.189 --> 04:33:55.199 align:start position:0%
track down the source as opposed to what
 
04:33:57.429 --> 04:33:57.439 align:start position:0%
is going to happen is the assumption
 
04:33:58.949 --> 04:33:58.959 align:start position:0%
will be that the
 
04:34:01.750 --> 04:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
apartment needs to be abated
 
04:34:01.760 --> 04:34:02.869 align:start position:0%
apartment needs to be abated
so

04:34:02.869 --> 04:34:02.879 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:34:04.709 --> 04:34:04.719 align:start position:0%
there are many different
 
04:34:04.719 --> 04:34:05.830 align:start position:0%
there are many different
causes

04:34:05.830 --> 04:34:05.840 align:start position:0%
causes
 
04:34:08.629 --> 04:34:08.639 align:start position:0%
of increased lead levels in children and
 
04:34:10.869 --> 04:34:10.879 align:start position:0%
perhaps i i messed up on the the
 
04:34:13.109 --> 04:34:13.119 align:start position:0%
medicare medicaid thing because i grew
 
04:34:15.990 --> 04:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
up before 78 and it was leading the gas
 
04:34:17.929 --> 04:34:17.939 align:start position:0%
and there was lead in the paint so
 
04:34:17.939 --> 04:34:19.349 align:start position:0%
and there was lead in the paint so
[Music]

04:34:19.349 --> 04:34:19.359 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:34:19.359 --> 04:34:20.551 align:start position:0%
[Music]
so

04:34:20.551 --> 04:34:20.561 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:34:23.269 --> 04:34:23.279 align:start position:0%
we are going to
 
04:34:25.109 --> 04:34:25.119 align:start position:0%
cause more trouble
 
04:34:28.470 --> 04:34:28.480 align:start position:0%
in rental housing we are going to
 
04:34:31.029 --> 04:34:31.039 align:start position:0%
increase the price of rentals
 
04:34:32.949 --> 04:34:32.959 align:start position:0%
we are going to drive
 
04:34:35.510 --> 04:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
some homeowners and some building owners
 
04:34:37.990 --> 04:34:38.000 align:start position:0%
to convert their units to something
 
04:34:40.230 --> 04:34:40.240 align:start position:0%
other than rentals it's anything but
 
04:34:40.240 --> 04:34:41.349 align:start position:0%
other than rentals it's anything but
affordable

04:34:41.349 --> 04:34:41.359 align:start position:0%
affordable
 
04:34:43.349 --> 04:34:43.359 align:start position:0%
and the workforce housing stuff is not
 
04:34:46.789 --> 04:34:46.799 align:start position:0%
going to help as we've heard previously
 
04:34:49.269 --> 04:34:49.279 align:start position:0%
another section of this bill
 
04:34:51.990 --> 04:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
that concerns me
 
04:34:55.750 --> 04:34:55.760 align:start position:0%
is section 68 child protection act
 
04:34:55.760 --> 04:34:58.230 align:start position:0%

04:35:42.949 --> 04:35:42.959 align:start position:0%
that doesn't sound very good to me
 
04:35:42.959 --> 04:35:43.750 align:start position:0%
that doesn't sound very good to me
so

04:35:43.750 --> 04:35:43.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:35:46.390 --> 04:35:46.400 align:start position:0%
there are no numerous reasons to vote
 
04:35:48.470 --> 04:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
against this bill and i'll ask for a
 
04:35:49.670 --> 04:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
roll call
 
04:35:53.750 --> 04:35:53.760 align:start position:0%

was uh written for

mr speaker
 
04:38:16.551 --> 04:38:16.561 align:start position:0%
this bill is the worst idea
 
04:38:18.230 --> 04:38:18.240 align:start position:0%
and putting it all together as one
 
04:38:20.551 --> 04:38:20.561 align:start position:0%
gigantic omnibus bill is the worst idea
 
04:38:22.390 --> 04:38:22.400 align:start position:0%
since congress spent three million
 
04:38:24.949 --> 04:38:24.959 align:start position:0%
dollars injecting hamsters with steroids
 
04:38:26.230 --> 04:38:26.240 align:start position:0%

northwestern university study
 
04:38:31.269 --> 04:38:31.279 align:start position:0%
i ask members to press the red button
 
04:38:33.029 --> 04:38:33.039 align:start position:0%
and vote this bill down and we can bring
 
04:38:35.189 --> 04:38:35.199 align:start position:0%
these 29 issues up again next session
 
04:38:39.990 --> 04:38:40.000 align:start position:0%

and we went through it bit by bit and
 
04:40:11.990 --> 04:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
i'm going to try to do that right now
 
04:40:13.750 --> 04:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
with you
 
04:40:16.390 --> 04:40:16.400 align:start position:0%

1661
 
04:40:23.910 --> 04:40:23.920 align:start position:0%
is a result of five to six years of hard
 
04:40:25.670 --> 04:40:25.680 align:start position:0%
work and planning
 
04:40:27.590 --> 04:40:27.600 align:start position:0%
by those from north to south east to
 
04:40:29.430 --> 04:40:29.440 align:start position:0%
west in the state to have something to
 
04:40:31.510 --> 04:40:31.520 align:start position:0%
do with career and technical education
 
04:40:34.230 --> 04:40:34.240 align:start position:0%
including parents including directors
 
04:40:36.708 --> 04:40:36.718 align:start position:0%
including advisory councils including
 
04:40:38.948 --> 04:40:38.958 align:start position:0%
folks like the new hampshire automobile
 
04:40:41.750 --> 04:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
association all working towards trying
 
04:40:44.470 --> 04:40:44.480 align:start position:0%
to double the number of kids that we're
 
04:40:46.470 --> 04:40:46.480 align:start position:0%
going to have graduating from our high
 
04:40:47.750 --> 04:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
schools here
 
04:40:50.550 --> 04:40:50.560 align:start position:0%
and preparing them for career
 
04:40:53.510 --> 04:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
that we urgently need to maintain our
 
04:40:55.430 --> 04:40:55.440 align:start position:0%
economy in this state
 
04:40:58.230 --> 04:40:58.240 align:start position:0%
this bill is probably if i were to name
 
04:41:00.550 --> 04:41:00.560 align:start position:0%
two bills or three bills in education
 
04:41:03.030 --> 04:41:03.040 align:start position:0%
which are top priority this is one of
 
04:41:06.868 --> 04:41:06.878 align:start position:0%
them and it's a bipartisan bill 1661.
 
04:41:12.070 --> 04:41:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:14.310 --> 04:41:14.320 align:start position:0%
i don't park my car there anymore
 
04:41:17.830 --> 04:41:17.840 align:start position:0%
and even i would i wouldn't
 
04:41:20.628 --> 04:41:20.638 align:start position:0%
i have seen cement on the floor of that
 
04:41:24.390 --> 04:41:24.400 align:start position:0%
garage that has come from the ceiling
 
04:41:25.990 --> 04:41:26.000 align:start position:0%
and there are staff working in this
 
04:41:30.230 --> 04:41:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:33.110 --> 04:41:33.120 align:start position:0%
this bill will provide the 9.35 million
 
04:41:35.750 --> 04:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
dollars necessary for design
 
04:41:37.670 --> 04:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
and preparing for engineering and
 
04:41:41.030 --> 04:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
raising the building and getting us into
 
04:41:43.990 --> 04:41:44.000 align:start position:0%
a place that's needed that's safe and
 
04:41:46.868 --> 04:41:46.878 align:start position:0%
will provide up a location to put our
 
04:41:46.878 --> 04:41:48.230 align:start position:0%
will provide up a location to put our
vehicles

04:41:48.230 --> 04:41:48.240 align:start position:0%
vehicles
 
04:41:50.230 --> 04:41:50.240 align:start position:0%
we're well beyond the lifespan of that
 
04:41:52.788 --> 04:41:52.798 align:start position:0%
garage down in store street well beyond
 
04:41:55.830 --> 04:41:55.840 align:start position:0%
the lifespan and now we're at a point
 
04:41:59.350 --> 04:41:59.360 align:start position:0%
where such disrepair
 
04:42:00.948 --> 04:42:00.958 align:start position:0%
there's going to be an accident if we
 
04:42:03.510 --> 04:42:03.520 align:start position:0%
let it go much longer we cannot kick
 
04:42:06.230 --> 04:42:06.240 align:start position:0%
this can down the road any further it's
 
04:42:08.708 --> 04:42:08.718 align:start position:0%
time to do something and that time
 
04:42:11.190 --> 04:42:11.200 align:start position:0%
is now
 
04:42:12.470 --> 04:42:12.480 align:start position:0%
when you're looking at the third
 
04:42:14.868 --> 04:42:14.878 align:start position:0%
component of this bill
 
04:42:17.110 --> 04:42:17.120 align:start position:0%
the health and human services
 
04:42:18.868 --> 04:42:18.878 align:start position:0%
there has been a whole lot of discussion

content in this building which is going
 
04:49:52.470 --> 04:49:52.480 align:start position:0%
to be best for our state
 
04:49:54.868 --> 04:49:54.878 align:start position:0%

if i know that this omnibus bill is a

and will burden local services and raise
 
04:57:31.030 --> 04:57:31.040 align:start position:0%

04:58:17.750 --> 04:58:17.760 align:start position:0%
the garage because the property is

remember it may continue
 
05:02:26.310 --> 05:02:26.320 align:start position:0%
so 20 years ago i had a conversation
 
05:02:28.230 --> 05:02:28.240 align:start position:0%
with representative steve allencourt he
 
05:02:31.030 --> 05:02:31.040 align:start position:0%
was the first legislator i ever
 
05:02:32.708 --> 05:02:32.718 align:start position:0%
spoke with and had a conversation with
 
05:02:34.230 --> 05:02:34.240 align:start position:0%
about legislative issues and the issue
 
05:02:36.470 --> 05:02:36.480 align:start position:0%
that came up with was whether or not to
 
05:02:38.788 --> 05:02:38.798 align:start position:0%
lower the drinking age in new hampshire
 
05:02:41.430 --> 05:02:41.440 align:start position:0%
to 18.
 
05:02:43.670 --> 05:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
and that's a bill that that as he said
 
05:02:47.510 --> 05:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
comes up every almost every session
 
05:02:49.270 --> 05:02:49.280 align:start position:0%
but when i came up to the legislature as
 
05:02:51.030 --> 05:02:51.040 align:start position:0%
a private citizen
 
05:02:52.470 --> 05:02:52.480 align:start position:0%
several members mentioned the national
 
05:02:54.390 --> 05:02:54.400 align:start position:0%
minimum drinking age act which is a
 
05:02:56.390 --> 05:02:56.400 align:start position:0%
federal bill
 
05:02:58.150 --> 05:02:58.160 align:start position:0%
uh which includes a couple of different
 
05:03:00.150 --> 05:03:00.160 align:start position:0%
exceptions but there's there's only one
 
05:03:02.230 --> 05:03:02.240 align:start position:0%
operative sentence in it the whole the
 
05:03:04.310 --> 05:03:04.320 align:start position:0%
whole law is five sentences long but
 
05:03:06.310 --> 05:03:06.320 align:start position:0%
i'll just read the one the secretary
 
05:03:07.990 --> 05:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
shall withhold 10
 
05:03:09.990 --> 05:03:10.000 align:start position:0%
percent of the amount required to be
 
05:03:12.230 --> 05:03:12.240 align:start position:0%
apportioned by any state under each of
 
05:03:14.310 --> 05:03:14.320 align:start position:0%
the sections in 104
 
05:03:15.670 --> 05:03:15.680 align:start position:0%
of this title
 
05:03:17.750 --> 05:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
on the first day of each fiscal year
 
05:03:19.350 --> 05:03:19.360 align:start position:0%
after the second fiscal year beginning
 
05:03:22.070 --> 05:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
in september 1985 in which the purchase
 
05:03:23.910 --> 05:03:23.920 align:start position:0%
or sale
 
05:03:25.830 --> 05:03:25.840 align:start position:0%
sorry the purchase or public possession
 
05:03:27.510 --> 05:03:27.520 align:start position:0%
in any such state of any alcoholic
 
05:03:29.990 --> 05:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
beverage by a person who is less than 21
 
05:03:32.230 --> 05:03:32.240 align:start position:0%
years of age is lawful every time this
 
05:03:32.240 --> 05:03:35.510 align:start position:0%
years of age is lawful every time this
feels

05:03:35.510 --> 05:03:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:37.270 --> 05:03:37.280 align:start position:0%
every time this bill has come up we hear
 
05:03:40.310 --> 05:03:40.320 align:start position:0%
the national minimum drinking age act as
 
05:03:42.150 --> 05:03:42.160 align:start position:0%
that being the reason that we would lose
 
05:03:43.670 --> 05:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
10 percent of our federal highway
 
05:03:47.190 --> 05:03:47.200 align:start position:0%
funding but 45 state legislatures
 
05:03:49.510 --> 05:03:49.520 align:start position:0%
45 state legislatures make exceptions
 
05:03:51.510 --> 05:03:51.520 align:start position:0%
for religious reasons or family reasons
 
05:03:53.350 --> 05:03:53.360 align:start position:0%
or others
 
05:03:56.150 --> 05:03:56.160 align:start position:0%
what what vallencourt told me was that
 
05:03:57.910 --> 05:03:57.920 align:start position:0%
even if you have to be
 
05:04:00.390 --> 05:04:00.400 align:start position:0%
abrasive even if you
 
05:04:02.230 --> 05:04:02.240 align:start position:0%
upset people's opinions even if you
 
05:04:04.470 --> 05:04:04.480 align:start position:0%
offend people to tell the truth at the
 
05:04:04.480 --> 05:04:05.430 align:start position:0%
offend people to tell the truth at the
well

05:04:05.430 --> 05:04:05.440 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:04:07.190 --> 05:04:07.200 align:start position:0%
and i i've learned over the years in
 
05:04:09.670 --> 05:04:09.680 align:start position:0%
three terms as a state representative
 
05:04:11.590 --> 05:04:11.600 align:start position:0%
that your integrity is really all you
 
05:04:13.350 --> 05:04:13.360 align:start position:0%
have is we're just one of four hundred
 
05:04:13.360 --> 05:04:15.190 align:start position:0%
have is we're just one of four hundred
members

05:04:15.190 --> 05:04:15.200 align:start position:0%
members
 
05:04:18.550 --> 05:04:18.560 align:start position:0%
and if members here do support alcohol
 
05:04:21.030 --> 05:04:21.040 align:start position:0%
prohibition marijuana prohibition gun
 
05:04:23.030 --> 05:04:23.040 align:start position:0%
prohibition gambling prohibition or any
 
05:04:25.030 --> 05:04:25.040 align:start position:0%
other prohibition policy then by all
 
05:04:27.990 --> 05:04:28.000 align:start position:0%
means say so but don't hide behind
 
05:04:30.310 --> 05:04:30.320 align:start position:0%
a a federal law that
 
05:04:32.390 --> 05:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
everyone has to go refer to and go read
 
05:04:33.590 --> 05:04:33.600 align:start position:0%
to find out
 
05:04:35.830 --> 05:04:35.840 align:start position:0%
that state legislatures do in fact have
 
05:04:37.590 --> 05:04:37.600 align:start position:0%
the right to include religious and
 
05:04:40.550 --> 05:04:40.560 align:start position:0%
family exemptions to the drinking age 45
 
05:04:42.470 --> 05:04:42.480 align:start position:0%
states have different exceptions and not
 
05:04:44.150 --> 05:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
a single one has lost a dollar in
 
05:04:47.270 --> 05:04:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:50.708 --> 05:04:50.718 align:start position:0%
90 years ago in in the other room
 
05:04:52.948 --> 05:04:52.958 align:start position:0%
at a state ratifying convention nine
 
05:04:54.628 --> 05:04:54.638 align:start position:0%
delegates met
 
05:04:57.510 --> 05:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
to ratify the 21st amendment bringing an
 
05:04:59.110 --> 05:04:59.120 align:start position:0%
end to alcohol prohibition in our
 
05:04:59.120 --> 05:05:01.270 align:start position:0%
end to alcohol prohibition in our
society

05:05:01.270 --> 05:05:01.280 align:start position:0%
society
 
05:05:03.830 --> 05:05:03.840 align:start position:0%
and they meant for only a single purpose
 
05:05:06.550 --> 05:05:06.560 align:start position:0%
they had a very very short discussion
 
05:05:08.868 --> 05:05:08.878 align:start position:0%
and like 30 somewhat other states they
 
05:05:10.150 --> 05:05:10.160 align:start position:0%
finally brought an end to alcohol
 
05:05:15.190 --> 05:05:15.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:18.390 --> 05:05:18.400 align:start position:0%
the member has a right to speak
 
05:05:20.550 --> 05:05:20.560 align:start position:0%
we're almost done
 
05:05:27.590 --> 05:05:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:29.910 --> 05:05:29.920 align:start position:0%
so i have only one point to make
 
05:05:32.070 --> 05:05:32.080 align:start position:0%
in case i don't get reelected for the
 
05:05:33.990 --> 05:05:34.000 align:start position:0%
next term and this is if this is the
 
05:05:35.830 --> 05:05:35.840 align:start position:0%
last time you ever hear me
 
05:05:37.910 --> 05:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
prohibition never works
 
05:05:39.990 --> 05:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
it always has always made crime worse
 
05:05:41.750 --> 05:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
whether it was drug prohibition alcohol
 
05:05:43.510 --> 05:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
prohibition gun prohibition or any other
 
05:05:45.510 --> 05:05:45.520 align:start position:0%
type it always breaks down respect for
 
05:05:47.670 --> 05:05:47.680 align:start position:0%
the rule of law it always results in a
 
05:05:49.350 --> 05:05:49.360 align:start position:0%
loss of civil liberties it always
 
05:05:51.110 --> 05:05:51.120 align:start position:0%
results in swat rates and mass
 
05:05:53.750 --> 05:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
incarceration and wasting juries time
 
05:05:56.150 --> 05:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
and wasting people's time and money it
 
05:05:57.750 --> 05:05:57.760 align:start position:0%
has always contributed to a breakdown
 
05:05:59.750 --> 05:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
and respect for the rule of law in any
 
05:06:01.750 --> 05:06:01.760 align:start position:0%
society every time congress has stepped
 
05:06:04.708 --> 05:06:04.718 align:start position:0%
up drug prohibition crime has gone up
 
05:06:06.550 --> 05:06:06.560 align:start position:0%
every time congress stepped up alcohol
 
05:06:08.310 --> 05:06:08.320 align:start position:0%
prohibition crime went up every time
 
05:06:11.270 --> 05:06:11.280 align:start position:0%
congress stepped up the
 
05:06:13.110 --> 05:06:13.120 align:start position:0%
gun prohibition crime has gone up and we
 
05:06:14.628 --> 05:06:14.638 align:start position:0%
don't have much control over what
 
05:06:17.510 --> 05:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
congress does as other members have said
 
05:06:19.190 --> 05:06:19.200 align:start position:0%
but we can at least set an example that
 
05:06:20.230 --> 05:06:20.240 align:start position:0%
we will be
 
05:06:22.070 --> 05:06:22.080 align:start position:0%
careful not only with the laws that we
 
05:06:22.080 --> 05:06:23.510 align:start position:0%
careful not only with the laws that we
enact

05:06:23.510 --> 05:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
enact
 
05:06:25.030 --> 05:06:25.040 align:start position:0%
but also with the statements that we
 
05:06:26.470 --> 05:06:26.480 align:start position:0%
make on the floor you've heard me
 
05:06:28.708 --> 05:06:28.718 align:start position:0%
apologize a number of times this session
 
05:06:30.390 --> 05:06:30.400 align:start position:0%
for statements that i made

the member will suspend for a minute
 
05:11:27.750 --> 05:11:27.760 align:start position:0%
we need to keep members in the chamber
 
05:11:29.190 --> 05:11:29.200 align:start position:0%
so we can have
 
05:11:31.430 --> 05:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
enough of a quorum to finish our
 
05:11:35.910 --> 05:11:35.920 align:start position:0%

the member will continue
 
05:11:40.230 --> 05:11:40.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker yesterday i was in
 
05:11:42.550 --> 05:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
a seacoast area high school talking with
 
05:11:44.150 --> 05:11:44.160 align:start position:0%
the head of counseling
 
05:11:46.310 --> 05:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
and they told me that that school used
 
05:11:49.190 --> 05:11:49.200 align:start position:0%
to have nine scheduled fire drills
 
05:11:51.830 --> 05:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
during the school year and now
 
05:11:55.750 --> 05:11:55.760 align:start position:0%
they have five fire drills and four
 
05:11:58.390 --> 05:11:58.400 align:start position:0%
active shooter drills instead
 
05:12:01.590 --> 05:12:01.600 align:start position:0%
like many of you here i have worked both
 
05:12:03.990 --> 05:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
in a school and for me it was a seacoast
 
05:12:05.990 --> 05:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
elementary school where i
 
05:12:08.628 --> 05:12:08.638 align:start position:0%
um was a paraprofessional in the special
 
05:12:09.910 --> 05:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
ed department
 
05:12:11.910 --> 05:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
and i also volunteered as many of you
 
05:12:14.230 --> 05:12:14.240 align:start position:0%
did as a room parent a coach a scout
 
05:12:17.110 --> 05:12:17.120 align:start position:0%
leader and an activity chaperone
 
05:12:18.868 --> 05:12:18.878 align:start position:0%
it was the best
 
05:12:21.270 --> 05:12:21.280 align:start position:0%
when as an adult though you participate
 
05:12:23.990 --> 05:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
in one of these active shooter drills it
 
05:12:26.628 --> 05:12:26.638 align:start position:0%
is really painful to be with the
 
05:12:28.470 --> 05:12:28.480 align:start position:0%
students as they huddle
 
05:12:30.628 --> 05:12:30.638 align:start position:0%
against a cement wall away from the
 
05:12:32.550 --> 05:12:32.560 align:start position:0%
windows and the doors
 
05:12:36.868 --> 05:12:36.878 align:start position:0%
and as a parent i have felt the panic
 
05:12:39.750 --> 05:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
and the fear of calling my child's cell
 
05:12:42.788 --> 05:12:42.798 align:start position:0%
phone to hear their voice when i got
 
05:12:42.798 --> 05:12:43.990 align:start position:0%
phone to hear their voice when i got
word

05:12:43.990 --> 05:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
word
 
05:12:46.070 --> 05:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
that there was a gunman waving a gun
 
05:12:47.670 --> 05:12:47.680 align:start position:0%
around in the parking lot of the
 
05:12:52.230 --> 05:12:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:55.030 --> 05:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
we don't have gun policies in this state
 
05:12:58.550 --> 05:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
we leave our fate to chance
 
05:13:00.948 --> 05:13:00.958 align:start position:0%
leaving our fate to chance means that
 
05:13:03.190 --> 05:13:03.200 align:start position:0%
anything is possible
 
05:13:05.430 --> 05:13:05.440 align:start position:0%
anything can happen
 
05:13:09.110 --> 05:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
we roll the dice every day with our
 
05:13:10.788 --> 05:13:10.798 align:start position:0%
children's safety
 
05:13:14.310 --> 05:13:14.320 align:start position:0%
our policy on gun violence prevention
 
05:13:18.550 --> 05:13:18.560 align:start position:0%
is to depend on luck
 
05:13:21.590 --> 05:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
and i don't think it's a good policy to
 
05:13:24.390 --> 05:13:24.400 align:start position:0%
depend on luck because luck is
 
05:13:24.400 --> 05:13:26.470 align:start position:0%
depend on luck because luck is
capricious

05:13:26.470 --> 05:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
capricious
 
05:13:29.430 --> 05:13:29.440 align:start position:0%
we are only five months into this year
 
05:13:33.030 --> 05:13:33.040 align:start position:0%
and 27 american schools have experienced
 
05:13:33.040 --> 05:13:34.708 align:start position:0%

05:13:34.708 --> 05:13:34.718 align:start position:0%

last year
 
05:13:38.948 --> 05:13:38.958 align:start position:0%
there were 34 over the whole school year
 
05:13:41.030 --> 05:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
and schools were closed for a
 
05:13:43.110 --> 05:13:43.120 align:start position:0%
significant portion of the year because
 
05:13:46.788 --> 05:13:46.798 align:start position:0%
of a covid19 pandemic
 
05:13:48.470 --> 05:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
eight more school shootings this year
 
05:13:51.190 --> 05:13:51.200 align:start position:0%
and we break the record
 
05:13:53.270 --> 05:13:53.280 align:start position:0%
but the unlucky
 
05:13:56.070 --> 05:13:56.080 align:start position:0%
aren't only limited to schools you can
 
05:13:58.868 --> 05:13:58.878 align:start position:0%

05:14:01.510 --> 05:14:01.520 align:start position:0%
you can be unlucky praying in a
 
05:14:04.070 --> 05:14:04.080 align:start position:0%
synagogue or at a church
 
05:14:06.230 --> 05:14:06.240 align:start position:0%
you can be unlucky playing ball at the
 
05:14:08.708 --> 05:14:08.718 align:start position:0%
field attending a music festival or
 
05:14:10.628 --> 05:14:10.638 align:start position:0%

you can be unlucky at the movies the
 
05:14:16.390 --> 05:14:16.400 align:start position:0%
possibilities are just endless
 
05:14:19.430 --> 05:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
particularly in new hampshire in america

the police who race into places
 
05:15:47.190 --> 05:15:47.200 align:start position:0%
people should be racing out of
 
05:15:49.430 --> 05:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
securing crime scenes and bearing the
 
05:15:51.350 --> 05:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
burden of having to try to quickly
 
05:15:54.948 --> 05:15:54.958 align:start position:0%
discern who is friend or foe during

05:16:03.350 --> 05:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
let's think about the emts working to

restart hearts that have stopped
 
05:16:06.400 --> 05:16:07.270 align:start position:0%

gaping wounds
 
05:16:12.390 --> 05:16:12.400 align:start position:0%
tighten tourniquets to save limbs
 
05:16:15.430 --> 05:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
and encourage our loved ones to just
 
05:16:17.030 --> 05:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
hang on
 
05:16:19.990 --> 05:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
as they are raced to the hospital
 
05:16:22.230 --> 05:16:22.240 align:start position:0%
we thank you
 
05:16:24.390 --> 05:16:24.400 align:start position:0%
the emergency room staff who whisk the
 
05:16:26.628 --> 05:16:26.638 align:start position:0%
gurneys of the bleeding and broken into
 
05:16:28.708 --> 05:16:28.718 align:start position:0%
sterile rooms and use all of their
 
05:16:31.750 --> 05:16:31.760 align:start position:0%
medical education and training to fix
 
05:16:34.070 --> 05:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
what has been blown apart
 
05:16:36.390 --> 05:16:36.400 align:start position:0%
the doctors and nurses who work
 
05:16:39.510 --> 05:16:39.520 align:start position:0%
valiantly to save lives and keep us
 
05:16:41.990 --> 05:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
updated in waiting rooms where we
 
05:16:42.000 --> 05:16:43.270 align:start position:0%
updated in waiting rooms where we
suffocate

05:16:43.270 --> 05:16:43.280 align:start position:0%
suffocate
 
05:16:46.628 --> 05:16:46.638 align:start position:0%
from worry and despair
 
05:16:48.550 --> 05:16:48.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:16:51.030 --> 05:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
let's remember the custodians who have
 
05:16:54.150 --> 05:16:54.160 align:start position:0%
to pick up the computers backpacks lunch
 
05:16:57.350 --> 05:16:57.360 align:start position:0%
boxes overturned shopping carts and
 
05:16:59.030 --> 05:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
prayer books
 
05:17:01.030 --> 05:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
so that the crime scene cleaners can
 
05:17:04.150 --> 05:17:04.160 align:start position:0%
come in and scoop up mounds of flesh and
 
05:17:06.948 --> 05:17:06.958 align:start position:0%
wipe blood stains off the walls and the
 
05:17:06.958 --> 05:17:08.390 align:start position:0%
wipe blood stains off the walls and the
floors

05:17:08.390 --> 05:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
floors
 
05:17:11.750 --> 05:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
i i would remind the member that graphic
 
05:17:13.590 --> 05:17:13.600 align:start position:0%
stuff like that i have ruled against
 
05:17:16.230 --> 05:17:16.240 align:start position:0%
before and keep that in mind that that
 
05:17:18.948 --> 05:17:18.958 align:start position:0%
is unappropriate
 
05:17:23.750 --> 05:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:25.990 --> 05:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
think of the unlucky journalists who
 
05:17:29.190 --> 05:17:29.200 align:start position:0%
cover the scenes of the unlucky over and
 
05:17:32.150 --> 05:17:32.160 align:start position:0%
over again the words they write seem
 
05:17:34.310 --> 05:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
insufficient and the photos just
 
05:17:36.788 --> 05:17:36.798 align:start position:0%
shockingly familiar
 
05:17:38.788 --> 05:17:38.798 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:17:40.868 --> 05:17:40.878 align:start position:0%
if the ones left behind are lucky enough
 
05:17:43.510 --> 05:17:43.520 align:start position:0%
to access mental health care will they
 
05:17:46.150 --> 05:17:46.160 align:start position:0%
be lucky enough to find someone who can
 
05:17:49.670 --> 05:17:49.680 align:start position:0%
shine just a little bit of light into
 
05:17:53.270 --> 05:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
the deep and enveloping pain of the dark
 
05:17:57.910 --> 05:17:57.920 align:start position:0%
places that survivors are thrust into
 
05:17:59.830 --> 05:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
some survivors are lucky enough to be
 
05:18:02.310 --> 05:18:02.320 align:start position:0%
the recipients of meal trains where
 
05:18:04.948 --> 05:18:04.958 align:start position:0%
friends and neighbors bring food
 
05:18:08.788 --> 05:18:08.798 align:start position:0%
and even the most lovingly prepared meal
 
05:18:13.030 --> 05:18:13.040 align:start position:0%
cannot fill the empty place at the table
 
05:18:16.948 --> 05:18:16.958 align:start position:0%
teachers eva moreless and irma garcia
 
05:18:20.150 --> 05:18:20.160 align:start position:0%
came to school two days ago to teach
 
05:18:22.310 --> 05:18:22.320 align:start position:0%
and drew their last breath trying to
 
05:18:24.390 --> 05:18:24.400 align:start position:0%
protect their students
 
05:18:26.070 --> 05:18:26.080 align:start position:0%
from the unluckiness
 
05:18:28.390 --> 05:18:28.400 align:start position:0%
of being in the classroom chosen by a
 
05:18:30.230 --> 05:18:30.240 align:start position:0%
mass shooter

the tragedies we see every day show how
 
05:18:42.948 --> 05:18:42.958 align:start position:0%
the odds are stacked against us and we
 
05:18:44.788 --> 05:18:44.798 align:start position:0%
need to act

need to act
we

05:18:45.590 --> 05:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
we
 
05:18:48.628 --> 05:18:48.638 align:start position:0%
have passed gun violence legislation
 
05:18:52.150 --> 05:18:52.160 align:start position:0%
prevention measures in this house before
 
05:18:54.390 --> 05:18:54.400 align:start position:0%

drowned out by gunfire
 
05:19:00.628 --> 05:19:00.638 align:start position:0%
it wasn't luck it was hard work
 
05:19:03.750 --> 05:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
we can do hard things
 
05:19:06.470 --> 05:19:06.480 align:start position:0%
we need more people to work to make our
 
05:19:09.670 --> 05:19:09.680 align:start position:0%
community safe from gun violence to lead
 
05:19:12.310 --> 05:19:12.320 align:start position:0%
to stand up for safe schools and
 
05:19:15.110 --> 05:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
communities so that teachers
 
05:19:17.750 --> 05:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
grocery store clerks
 
05:19:19.430 --> 05:19:19.440 align:start position:0%
and clergy
 
05:19:22.230 --> 05:19:22.240 align:start position:0%
don't have to defend themselves as if
 
05:19:24.868 --> 05:19:24.878 align:start position:0%
they are in the theater of war

our schools places of worship stores

this house

be gunned down in senseless slaughter
 
05:20:06.708 --> 05:20:06.718 align:start position:0%
we can reduce that chance of tragedy
 
05:20:11.830 --> 05:20:11.840 align:start position:0%
we can turn around our own luck but only
 
05:20:14.788 --> 05:20:14.798 align:start position:0%
