have yes excuse me representative Brown
 
00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 align:start position:0%
for planning purposes no committee
 
00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 align:start position:0%
meetings next week two hear two days of
 
00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 align:start position:0%
hearings on the Senate bills we already
 
00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 align:start position:0%
have on the 3D and the 10th those will
 
00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 align:start position:0%
be full days but it'll get rid of all
 
00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 align:start position:0%
the Senate bills we have
 
00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 align:start position:0%
already and uh
 
00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 align:start position:0%
and then we'll we'll go on from there it
 
00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 align:start position:0%
looks like most of the Senate bills are
 
00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:39.079 align:start position:0%
much easier than the house bills thank
 
00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 align:start position:0%
goodness oh and for planning purposes if
 
00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 align:start position:0%
anybody has something they want to bring
 
00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 align:start position:0%
in as an a uh non- gerain Amendment we
 
00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 align:start position:0%
have a Senate bill that is identical to
 
00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 align:start position:0%
the social worker compact we have
 
00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 align:start position:0%
already dealt with and I'd love to stick
 
00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 align:start position:0%
an on Germaine Amendment on that one so
 
00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 align:start position:0%
know well it is by definition identical
 
00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 align:start position:0%
to the house
 
00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 align:start position:0%
paper that's why I said that's it will
 
00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 align:start position:0%
be much less controversial than any
 
00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 align:start position:0%
other bill that we would want to gut and
 
00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519 align:start position:0%
replace so let me know all right we are
 
00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 align:start position:0%

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 align:start position:0%
second represent do you wish to speak to
 
00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 align:start position:0%
your motion yes so um last year when we
 
00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 align:start position:0%
passed house bills uh 655 and other um
 
00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 align:start position:0%
bills that that concerned the
 
00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 align:start position:0%
administration of
 
00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 align:start position:0%
oplc um we
 
00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 align:start position:0%
left existing statute regarding fees and
 
00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.630 align:start position:0%
left existing statute regarding fees and
um

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:32.319 align:start position:0%
uh sorry
 
00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 align:start position:0%
investigations licensing under the
 
00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:35.990 align:start position:0%
investigations licensing under the
board's

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
board's
 
00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 align:start position:0%
responsibility so this amendment moves
 
00:03:42.149 --> 00:03:42.159 align:start position:0%
for all the boards that responsibility
 
00:03:46.149 --> 00:03:46.159 align:start position:0%
from the board to the office so and so
 
00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 align:start position:0%
right now this amendment as it stands
 
00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 align:start position:0%
would correct all the conflicts between
 
00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 align:start position:0%
oplc and the boards on not only uh
 
00:04:00.149 --> 00:04:00.159 align:start position:0%
licensing setting fees for licens is an
 
00:04:03.149 --> 00:04:03.159 align:start position:0%
application recordkeeping and
 
00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 align:start position:0%
investigations it leaves with the with
 
00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 align:start position:0%
the board the credentialing the um
 
00:04:11.589 --> 00:04:11.599 align:start position:0%
adjudication of
 
00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:15.599 align:start position:0%
complaints and um the the the components
 
00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 align:start position:0%
of Licensing that the that really lie
 
00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:21.079 align:start position:0%
with the board as far as its specialty
 
00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 align:start position:0%
field okay and I'd like to add
 
00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 align:start position:0%
administratively that this completely
 
00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 align:start position:0%
replaces the contents of the bill the
 
00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
proper pronunciation of conquered and
 
00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:38.479 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire which we didn't see much
 
00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:41.479 align:start position:0%
support from the committee or the public
 
00:04:44.749 --> 00:04:44.759 align:start position:0%
at the hearing so if anyone objects to
 
00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 align:start position:0%
that speak up N I won't object but I
 
00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000 align:start position:0%
just was hoping to find out the proper
 
00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280 align:start position:0%
pronunciation for no hamsha and
 
00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 align:start position:0%
coner exactly actually there is an there
 
00:04:58.629 --> 00:04:58.639 align:start position:0%
is an r and
 
00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:03.629 align:start position:0%
is an r and
conquer

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:03.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 align:start position:0%
representative schz as a conquered rep
 
00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:13.029 --> 00:05:13.039 align:start position:0%
conquered ah thank you that's a good way
 
00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000 align:start position:0%
to put it
 
00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 align:start position:0%
anyway um so and this this is cleanup of
 
00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:23.400 align:start position:0%
conflicting statutes this is a large
 
00:05:25.749 --> 00:05:25.759 align:start position:0%
part of what we pulled out of House Bill
 
00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240 align:start position:0%
2 last year because we didn't have time
 
00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:31.280 align:start position:0%
to work on it representative grota has
 
00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:33.440 align:start position:0%
done a tremendous amount of
 
00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:37.800 align:start position:0%
work this is down to 90 96 pages she's
 
00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:41.080 align:start position:0%
taken about 30 pages out of it and it
 
00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:42.390 align:start position:0%
taken about 30 pages out of it and it
it's

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:42.400 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:44.680 align:start position:0%
all it is
 
00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:47.240 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly technical Corrections
 
00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
with no policy changes is that cor
 
00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:52.560 align:start position:0%
that's yeah so that's what it is and I
 
00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:54.600 align:start position:0%
might add representative um chair
 
00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:58.440 align:start position:0%
McGuire that the the um boards that are
 
00:06:02.749 --> 00:06:02.759 align:start position:0%
in 1271 one which is um the the board
 
00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:05.840 align:start position:0%
the bill that these those boards were
 
00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:08.639 align:start position:0%
taken out of this amendment so there'd
 
00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:10.680 align:start position:0%
be no
 
00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
conflict yeah we only want to deal with

each board once representative like meny
 
00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:19.360 align:start position:0%

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:27.720 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair so the question
 
00:06:30.909 --> 00:06:30.919 align:start position:0%
you partially answered my question that
 
00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:34.680 align:start position:0%
was coming with the are these amendments
 
00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:37.720 align:start position:0%
or changes both for Advisory Board as
 
00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
well as uh for um statute uh rul making
 
00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:44.639 align:start position:0%
board right no any board that was
 
00:06:48.189 --> 00:06:48.199 align:start position:0%
changed to an Advisory Board is in
 
00:06:51.469 --> 00:06:51.479 align:start position:0%
1271 uh this is only and has been
 
00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:55.160 align:start position:0%
removed from this amendment thank
 
00:06:58.510 --> 00:06:58.520 align:start position:0%
you anyone else have a representative
 
00:07:01.629 --> 00:07:01.639 align:start position:0%
goalie thank you madam chair and just
 
00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:04.680 align:start position:0%
one quick question I know we discussed
 
00:07:05.629 --> 00:07:05.639 align:start position:0%
when we were going through this
 
00:07:08.589 --> 00:07:08.599 align:start position:0%
amendment about numerous
 
00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:11.240 align:start position:0%
places that site office of professional
 
00:07:14.029 --> 00:07:14.039 align:start position:0%
licensure versus just office and I see a
 
00:07:18.309 --> 00:07:18.319 align:start position:0%
lot of the oplc still in here as versus
 
00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:20.560 align:start position:0%
just office and I thought to be
 
00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:22.720 align:start position:0%
consistent we were looking at cleaning
 
00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:24.400 align:start position:0%
that up and I just want to
 
00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:27.120 align:start position:0%
representative yes I spoke with OS about
 
00:07:29.189 --> 00:07:29.199 align:start position:0%
that and they specifically called me and
 
00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
they said said that they would like it
 
00:07:33.909 --> 00:07:33.919 align:start position:0%
to be office of license of they would
 
00:07:36.029 --> 00:07:36.039 align:start position:0%
like it to be license of uh office of
 
00:07:36.039 --> 00:07:37.510 align:start position:0%
like it to be license of uh office of
Licensing

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:37.520 align:start position:0%
Licensing
 
00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:41.400 align:start position:0%
certification because in um in
 
00:07:43.309 --> 00:07:43.319 align:start position:0%
legislation where they talk about
 
00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:46.680 align:start position:0%
departments they say the department of
 
00:07:50.469 --> 00:07:50.479 align:start position:0%
and they specify so you'll see that the
 
00:07:53.469 --> 00:07:53.479 align:start position:0%
beginning they they say office of
 
00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:55.800 align:start position:0%
professional license certification and
 
00:07:58.110 --> 00:07:58.120 align:start position:0%
then if the amendment I mean if the
 
00:08:00.029 --> 00:08:00.039 align:start position:0%
paragraph is long enough they'll use
 
00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:08.680 align:start position:0%
paragraph yeah I'm not I mean I'm not
 
00:08:10.029 --> 00:08:10.039 align:start position:0%
going to vote against this because of
 
00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:11.560 align:start position:0%
that but I see a lot of places where
 
00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:13.560 align:start position:0%
they're still very inconsistent and I'm
 
00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:16.960 align:start position:0%
not sure you know it is as
 
00:08:18.909 --> 00:08:18.919 align:start position:0%
representative groa said that if it
 
00:08:21.749 --> 00:08:21.759 align:start position:0%
deals with a section with multiple
 
00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:23.560 align:start position:0%
references the first reference is
 
00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:25.680 align:start position:0%
spelled out in detail and then the
 
00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:28.440 align:start position:0%
subsequent references just say
 
00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:30.110 align:start position:0%
subsequent references just say
office

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:30.120 align:start position:0%
office
 
00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
you could for example I just opened to
 
00:08:34.469 --> 00:08:34.479 align:start position:0%
page 58 and about
 
00:08:37.310 --> 00:08:37.320 align:start position:0%
Architects paragraph one has the office
 
00:08:40.589 --> 00:08:40.599 align:start position:0%
of professional license certification
 
00:08:44.509 --> 00:08:44.519 align:start position:0%
and then down you know five page five
 
00:08:47.509 --> 00:08:47.519 align:start position:0%
lines down it just says office and I'll
 
00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:50.360 align:start position:0%
just site where I'm making my question
 
00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:53.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:56.080 align:start position:0%
eight they start off with the office of
 
00:08:58.750 --> 00:08:58.760 align:start position:0%
professional lure in Roman number one
 
00:09:00.069 --> 00:09:00.079 align:start position:0%
and then you get down two when they're
 
00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:01.560 align:start position:0%
still using the office of professional
 
00:09:04.949 --> 00:09:04.959 align:start position:0%
lur so it's inconsistent you're so
 
00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:08.040 align:start position:0%
correct and that was asked to them to
 
00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
make it consistent and they still cannot
 
00:09:12.509 --> 00:09:12.519 align:start position:0%
correct it appropriately and that's just
 
00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:13.640 align:start position:0%
a point I want to make I'm not going to
 
00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:15.560 align:start position:0%
vote against it on nitpicking on that
 
00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:17.560 align:start position:0%
but they were asked to change and they
 
00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:19.560 align:start position:0%
didn't do it all right thank you I
 
00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:21.320 align:start position:0%

director and all of our other bills that
 
00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:30.360 align:start position:0%

consistent with this and you'll see that
 
00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:49.200 align:start position:0%
in the amendment probably the next most
 
00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:52.680 align:start position:0%
weighty Amendment changing from

comment even though the oplc is spelled
 
00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:50.480 align:start position:0%
out and but the consistency of office
 
00:11:53.069 --> 00:11:53.079 align:start position:0%
referring to oplc is a big improvement
 
00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
from what it was before thank you yes
 
00:11:58.509 --> 00:11:58.519 align:start position:0%
it's not perfect but it's better than it
 
00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
was so so we
 
00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:05.440 align:start position:0%
will we just don't want to deal with it
 
00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:07.360 align:start position:0%
and we don't we don't have time to deal
 
00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:10.000 align:start position:0%
with it anymore or get another iteration
 
00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
of of
 
00:12:13.629 --> 00:12:13.639 align:start position:0%
amendment all right anyone
 
00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:16.760 align:start position:0%
else well we should just follow it to
 
00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
make sure that the enrolled
 
00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:22.360 align:start position:0%
bills perfects it because everything
 
00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:26.320 align:start position:0%
You' said is exactly accurate uh and and
 
00:12:28.189 --> 00:12:28.199 align:start position:0%
I agree with representative goalie too
 
00:12:30.389 --> 00:12:30.399 align:start position:0%
that it should be consider IST the way
 
00:12:34.509 --> 00:12:34.519 align:start position:0%
we want it okay we will uh see what we
 
00:12:34.519 --> 00:12:36.870 align:start position:0%
we want it okay we will uh see what we
can

00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:40.120 align:start position:0%
do all right anyone else represented
 
00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
leus yeah and just uh the Senate will
 
00:12:43.509 --> 00:12:43.519 align:start position:0%
have their shot at it so if there's
 
00:12:45.269 --> 00:12:45.279 align:start position:0%
stuff like that to clean up they could
 
00:12:47.509 --> 00:12:47.519 align:start position:0%
take care of it if people want to bring
 
00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
that to them yes we will certainly
 
00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:53.920 align:start position:0%
expect them to
 
00:12:57.750 --> 00:12:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
else okay seeing none the motion is
 
00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:02.760 align:start position:0%

1248
 
00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:09.440 align:start position:0%
H all right moved by representative lais
 
00:14:12.189 --> 00:14:12.199 align:start position:0%
second by representative gold
 
00:14:15.629 --> 00:14:15.639 align:start position:0%
representative laus okay so this um does
 
00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
a number of
 
00:14:20.069 --> 00:14:20.079 align:start position:0%
things um I'll deal with kind of the it
 
00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:22.440 align:start position:0%
does some of the cleanup that was uh
 
00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:24.440 align:start position:0%
taken care of in the amendment we just
 
00:14:26.269 --> 00:14:26.279 align:start position:0%
voted for because the sections for these
 
00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
boards was removed from there so that
 
00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:30.880 align:start position:0%
should be similar but the substantive it
 
00:14:33.269 --> 00:14:33.279 align:start position:0%
does uh the substantive thing is it
 
00:14:36.189 --> 00:14:36.199 align:start position:0%
changes a number of boards from um
 
00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:40.040 align:start position:0%
regulatory boards to advisory boards and
 
00:14:43.269 --> 00:14:43.279 align:start position:0%
the the difference is that um the
 
00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:45.720 align:start position:0%
regulatory board has the authority they
 
00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:48.600 align:start position:0%
handle the ru making and while the
 
00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:51.440 align:start position:0%
administrative stuff is handled by
 
00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:54.160 align:start position:0%
oplc um the administrative board makes
 
00:14:56.949 --> 00:14:56.959 align:start position:0%
the decisions any decisions necessary on
 
00:14:59.590 --> 00:14:59.600 align:start position:0%
licenses and um they don't do the
 
00:15:02.069 --> 00:15:02.079 align:start position:0%
investigation on complaints but they do
 
00:15:05.509 --> 00:15:05.519 align:start position:0%
the adjudication on it an Advisory
 
00:15:08.829 --> 00:15:08.839 align:start position:0%
Board um The Authority for doing the
 
00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:10.920 align:start position:0%
rules and all that is with the office uh
 
00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:13.160 align:start position:0%
the office is required to consult with
 
00:15:14.590 --> 00:15:14.600 align:start position:0%
the board on all of
 
00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:16.509 align:start position:0%
the board on all of
that

00:15:16.509 --> 00:15:16.519 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:19.680 align:start position:0%
um but um you know once they once the
 
00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:22.480 align:start position:0%
rules are in place then the uh
 
00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:24.320 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy the gears turned there
 
00:15:26.189 --> 00:15:26.199 align:start position:0%
following the rules and Grant licenses
 
00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:29.720 align:start position:0%
or not you know as as appropriate
 
00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:32.240 align:start position:0%
and they uh they handle the uh the
 
00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
hearings and dealing with
 
00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:37.560 align:start position:0%
complaints um there's a one of the
 
00:15:39.629 --> 00:15:39.639 align:start position:0%
biggest arguments for having an Advisory
 
00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:42.600 align:start position:0%
Board is in situations where you have
 
00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
relatively few lies and the ones that
 
00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:49.120 align:start position:0%
affected here are you know on the lower
 
00:15:51.629 --> 00:15:51.639 align:start position:0%
end as far as the number of lenes
 
00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:54.440 align:start position:0%
there's a problem when you have um a
 
00:15:56.069 --> 00:15:56.079 align:start position:0%
small group you've got the market
 
00:15:59.110 --> 00:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
participants um making decisions on who
 
00:16:01.309 --> 00:16:01.319 align:start position:0%
can get licensed and what sanctions
 
00:16:04.189 --> 00:16:04.199 align:start position:0%
exist if somebody is alleged to you know
 
00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:07.480 align:start position:0%
commit some offense and there are um
 
00:16:10.110 --> 00:16:10.120 align:start position:0%
antitrust problems with that I mean the
 
00:16:11.829 --> 00:16:11.839 align:start position:0%
the most extreme example that's in this
 
00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:15.040 align:start position:0%
bill are the midwives there are uh 33
 
00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:17.800 align:start position:0%
currently licensed midwives in the State
 
00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:19.040 align:start position:0%
uh with three being on the board You'
 
00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
got almost 10% of all licensed midwives
 
00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:22.440 align:start position:0%
serving on the board and they know all
 
00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
know each other and so you know even if
 
00:16:28.509 --> 00:16:28.519 align:start position:0%
everybody is acting in a completely
 
00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
ethical manner there can be the
 
00:16:31.949 --> 00:16:31.959 align:start position:0%
appearance of a conflict of interest
 
00:16:34.749 --> 00:16:34.759 align:start position:0%
because they're making um you know
 
00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:37.000 align:start position:0%
decisions on people who are arguably
 
00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:39.680 align:start position:0%
potentially competitors and we heard
 
00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:44.040 align:start position:0%
that there was a um a lawsuit in uh it
 
00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:47.600 align:start position:0%
was North Carolina I believe where um
 
00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:49.160 align:start position:0%
the state was sued over this sort of
 
00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:53.120 align:start position:0%
thing and U the State lost and actually
 
00:16:54.749 --> 00:16:54.759 align:start position:0%
the board and the members on the board
 
00:16:56.269 --> 00:16:56.279 align:start position:0%
were actually held personally
 
00:16:59.629 --> 00:16:59.639 align:start position:0%
financially liable for damages for doing
 
00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:04.079 align:start position:0%
this and so there are reasons to make it
 
00:17:06.309 --> 00:17:06.319 align:start position:0%
clear that things are being handled in a
 
00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:09.280 align:start position:0%
a fair Manner and to remove some
 
00:17:11.309 --> 00:17:11.319 align:start position:0%
liability from the state and actually
 
00:17:13.110 --> 00:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
from the members on the
 
00:17:16.949 --> 00:17:16.959 align:start position:0%
boards um and I can go and what the the
 
00:17:20.870 --> 00:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
bill is drafted had uh there were some I
 
00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:23.240 align:start position:0%
think cursory decisions on the
 
00:17:24.669 --> 00:17:24.679 align:start position:0%
membership of the boards the boards were
 
00:17:27.069 --> 00:17:27.079 align:start position:0%
generally reduced in size somewhat I
 
00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:29.480 align:start position:0%
think mostly down to three and the
 
00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:31.120 align:start position:0%
subcommittee I like to thank everybody
 
00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:33.720 align:start position:0%
on it did an awful lot of work uh
 
00:17:35.669 --> 00:17:35.679 align:start position:0%
especially looking at that and we made
 
00:17:37.789 --> 00:17:37.799 align:start position:0%
quite a few changes in the amendment to
 
00:17:40.669 --> 00:17:40.679 align:start position:0%
membership of the uh the boards and the
 
00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
Midwife example um we changed the
 
00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:45.720 align:start position:0%
membership basically to what what the
 
00:17:48.789 --> 00:17:48.799 align:start position:0%
midwives wanted which was um you know
 
00:17:52.029 --> 00:17:52.039 align:start position:0%
several three midwives and um one OB
 
00:17:53.789 --> 00:17:53.799 align:start position:0%
doctor and one
 
00:17:56.190 --> 00:17:56.200 align:start position:0%
pediatrician um and various changes like
 
00:17:58.149 --> 00:17:58.159 align:start position:0%
that to to others and the membership of
 
00:17:59.149 --> 00:17:59.159 align:start position:0%
the other boards which is which is
 
00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:01.120 align:start position:0%
actually where we spent a lot of the
 
00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:03.080 align:start position:0%
time on it to try
 
00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:05.880 align:start position:0%
and come up with membership on the board
 
00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:07.280 align:start position:0%
that that have we thought had the
 
00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:09.240 align:start position:0%
expertise and represented the the groups
 
00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
that were interested and um you know
 
00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:13.200 align:start position:0%
went along with the feedback we heard
 
00:18:15.430 --> 00:18:15.440 align:start position:0%
from people that provided
 
00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:17.430 align:start position:0%
from people that provided
input

00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:17.440 align:start position:0%
input
 
00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:20.520 align:start position:0%
okay representative G and do you wish to
 
00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
speak to your
 
00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:24.480 align:start position:0%
second um no I think Tony said it all
 
00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair okay
 
00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:26.750 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair okay
representative

00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:26.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
Schmidt thank you madam chair well as we
 
00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:31.360 align:start position:0%
all know or some of the others may not
 
00:18:34.149 --> 00:18:34.159 align:start position:0%
know but we're on the record here and I
 
00:18:36.789 --> 00:18:36.799 align:start position:0%
think it's I agree with everything that
 
00:18:39.310 --> 00:18:39.320 align:start position:0%
representative leus just said uh and
 
00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:41.320 align:start position:0%
some of these small boards uh they just
 
00:18:43.029 --> 00:18:43.039 align:start position:0%
don't have the Manpower in addition to
 
00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:45.960 align:start position:0%
the liability aspects that you reference
 
00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
representative uh they just don't have
 
00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:50.120 align:start position:0%
the Manpower and and a number of these
 
00:18:53.029 --> 00:18:53.039 align:start position:0%
small boards they're only meeting once a
 
00:18:55.909 --> 00:18:55.919 align:start position:0%
quarter uh and that that's just not
 
00:18:59.870 --> 00:18:59.880 align:start position:0%
often enough to be on top of the the the
 
00:19:01.909 --> 00:19:01.919 align:start position:0%
little nitpicking details that make the
 
00:19:03.909 --> 00:19:03.919 align:start position:0%
difference whether you got a bearing
 
00:19:05.710 --> 00:19:05.720 align:start position:0%
that's running smoothly or whether you
 
00:19:09.789 --> 00:19:09.799 align:start position:0%
got a bearing that's got sand in it um
 
00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:12.240 align:start position:0%
and and and so forth and it's it's very
 
00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:15.400 align:start position:0%
important I can't emphasize too much
 
00:19:17.789 --> 00:19:17.799 align:start position:0%
that we are not taking the authority
 
00:19:20.549 --> 00:19:20.559 align:start position:0%
away from these smaller professions or
 
00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
any professions in terms of scope of
 
00:19:26.789 --> 00:19:26.799 align:start position:0%
practice and the the operation of the
 
00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:29.360 align:start position:0%
profession itself except ad
 
00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:32.240 align:start position:0%
administratively uh and that's what the
 
00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:33.310 align:start position:0%
administratively uh and that's what the
the

00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:33.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
these none of the boards can be can be
 
00:19:38.669 --> 00:19:38.679 align:start position:0%
absolutely assured that they are
 
00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:43.600 align:start position:0%
completely on top of all the 91a aspects
 
00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:45.880 align:start position:0%
and that that that type of thing that
 
00:19:48.549 --> 00:19:48.559 align:start position:0%
are important for making sure you don't
 
00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:53.080 align:start position:0%
step all over those statutes um and and
 
00:19:54.669 --> 00:19:54.679 align:start position:0%
but we're not taking them away so
 
00:19:56.230 --> 00:19:56.240 align:start position:0%
they're going to be standing out on the
 
00:19:58.950 --> 00:19:58.960 align:start position:0%
street so to speak looking into the
 
00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:02.240 align:start position:0%
window while the oplc runs Ru shod over
 
00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:04.400 align:start position:0%
their profession that was never Our
 
00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
intention I know that when the midwives
 
00:20:10.549 --> 00:20:10.559 align:start position:0%
were before us a couple of years ago
 
00:20:12.669 --> 00:20:12.679 align:start position:0%
those of us who were here remember they
 
00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
were very afraid that we were going to
 
00:20:18.149 --> 00:20:18.159 align:start position:0%
take away their profession and and let
 
00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
the OBGYNs for example have the have the
 
00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
the majority on the board so all those
 
00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:26.840 align:start position:0%
kinds of things are not what we intended
 
00:20:29.149 --> 00:20:29.159 align:start position:0%
we said it at the time but
 
00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:31.840 align:start position:0%
so those aspects are very important and
 
00:20:34.510 --> 00:20:34.520 align:start position:0%
that's why this executive session where
 
00:20:36.990 --> 00:20:37.000 align:start position:0%
they we're saying we're we're not taking
 
00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:39.520 align:start position:0%
away your profession we're only taking
 
00:20:44.669 --> 00:20:44.679 align:start position:0%
away the nitty-gritty of of relicensing
 
00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:47.120 align:start position:0%
and so forth so thank you very much for
 
00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:49.640 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to address this okay
 
00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:52.480 align:start position:0%
represent man py and then leus thank you
 
00:20:55.390 --> 00:20:55.400 align:start position:0%
madam chair having served on this uh
 
00:20:58.350 --> 00:20:58.360 align:start position:0%
subcommittee we spent hours and hours on
 
00:21:00.870 --> 00:21:00.880 align:start position:0%
it which was great great learning
 
00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:04.480 align:start position:0%
experience but I came out with the
 
00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
thought that there were nine boards that
 
00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:11.200 align:start position:0%
were listed to say going from regulatory
 
00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:17.320 align:start position:0%
board to um Advisory Board and um my
 
00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:20.640 align:start position:0%
understanding was that the regulatory
 
00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:24.720 align:start position:0%
board set the scope and um you know and
 
00:21:27.269 --> 00:21:27.279 align:start position:0%
The Advisory Board was recommending to
 
00:21:31.470 --> 00:21:31.480 align:start position:0%
OPC the shift of the
 
00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
professional uh um decision making moved
 
00:21:40.110 --> 00:21:40.120 align:start position:0%
from the board to OPC and there were um
 
00:21:43.310 --> 00:21:43.320 align:start position:0%
few boards that uh people who are very
 
00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
well respected in uh their field uh were
 
00:21:51.269 --> 00:21:51.279 align:start position:0%
very against it and I understand where
 
00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:55.760 align:start position:0%
the uh um opposition came from and I do
 
00:21:58.029 --> 00:21:58.039 align:start position:0%
respect that these people have done a
 
00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:01.320 align:start position:0%
lot of work work on the board and we
 
00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
have to listen to it so I will support
 
00:22:08.029 --> 00:22:08.039 align:start position:0%
the amendment but I will not be able to
 
00:22:08.039 --> 00:22:10.750 align:start position:0%
the amendment but I will not be able to
support

00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:10.760 align:start position:0%
support
 
00:22:16.269 --> 00:22:16.279 align:start position:0%
the bill as amended uh so there was I
 
00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:19.440 align:start position:0%
still have concerns in terms of it so
 
00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
thank you madam thank you representative
 
00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:24.600 align:start position:0%
lus thank you um few points first I I
 
00:22:27.230 --> 00:22:27.240 align:start position:0%
want to emphasize I agree with what
 
00:22:29.390 --> 00:22:29.400 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt said and want to
 
00:22:30.990 --> 00:22:31.000 align:start position:0%
emphasize the fact that nothing in here
 
00:22:32.990 --> 00:22:33.000 align:start position:0%
changes the scope of practice for any of
 
00:22:35.630 --> 00:22:35.640 align:start position:0%
these um one of one thing I neglected to
 
00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:38.200 align:start position:0%
mention is one of the things this does
 
00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:40.480 align:start position:0%
is combine the exist the what were
 
00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:42.640 align:start position:0%
existing advisory Boards of massage
 
00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:44.600 align:start position:0%
therapists with the existing Advisory
 
00:22:47.149 --> 00:22:47.159 align:start position:0%
Board of refle reflexology structural
 
00:22:49.909 --> 00:22:49.919 align:start position:0%
integration and aging bodyw work therapy
 
00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:51.520 align:start position:0%
that was done at the request of those
 
00:22:54.149 --> 00:22:54.159 align:start position:0%
boards that wasn't controversial uh but
 
00:22:59.149 --> 00:22:59.159 align:start position:0%
it is in here and on the the issue of
 
00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:01.080 align:start position:0%
um the authority of the board um we did
 
00:23:04.549 --> 00:23:04.559 align:start position:0%
add language requiring um oplc to
 
00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:06.880 align:start position:0%
consult with the board on the rul making
 
00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:09.200 align:start position:0%
which I understand doesn't require them
 
00:23:14.110 --> 00:23:14.120 align:start position:0%
to go along with the board um but the uh
 
00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
the members of the board also if they
 
00:23:18.590 --> 00:23:18.600 align:start position:0%
don't like the rules that oplc comes up
 
00:23:21.149 --> 00:23:21.159 align:start position:0%
with can be involved in the whole rul
 
00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:24.240 align:start position:0%
making process everything from the uh
 
00:23:25.789 --> 00:23:25.799 align:start position:0%
you know the public hearing written
 
00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
input and I mean if they don't get
 
00:23:33.070 --> 00:23:33.080 align:start position:0%
adjust they want their jail car so um
 
00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:37.200 align:start position:0%
you know if if oplc does something that
 
00:23:40.510 --> 00:23:40.520 align:start position:0%
is significantly counter to what the
 
00:23:42.909 --> 00:23:42.919 align:start position:0%
boards want and the Bo and but and
 
00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:44.640 align:start position:0%
they're being unreasonable then there's
 
00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:46.960 align:start position:0%
plenty of places for members of the
 
00:23:50.029 --> 00:23:50.039 align:start position:0%
board to or the board as a whole to
 
00:23:53.950 --> 00:23:53.960 align:start position:0%
intervene and uh and I think that is I
 
00:23:56.470 --> 00:23:56.480 align:start position:0%
mean I I you I think oplc is going to
 
00:23:57.870 --> 00:23:57.880 align:start position:0%
want the expertise from the boards
 
00:23:57.880 --> 00:23:58.990 align:start position:0%
want the expertise from the boards
anyway

00:23:58.990 --> 00:23:59.000 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
00:24:01.789 --> 00:24:01.799 align:start position:0%
but the fact that oplc isn't like the
 
00:24:03.870 --> 00:24:03.880 align:start position:0%
dictator it can do whatever they want
 
00:24:06.510 --> 00:24:06.520 align:start position:0%
with no remedy I think will be another
 
00:24:10.269 --> 00:24:10.279 align:start position:0%
Force to push them to um you know to
 
00:24:12.070 --> 00:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
work well with the boards and come up
 
00:24:14.190 --> 00:24:14.200 align:start position:0%
with rules that I think will work for
 
00:24:17.149 --> 00:24:17.159 align:start position:0%
both of them okay represent
 
00:24:20.669 --> 00:24:20.679 align:start position:0%
goie thank you madam chair and first I
 
00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:22.240 align:start position:0%
want to thank uh representative licas
 
00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
and the subcommittee for the work they
 
00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:26.960 align:start position:0%
did on this amendment um I'll support
 
00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:28.720 align:start position:0%
the amendment but unfortunately I won't
 
00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:31.080 align:start position:0%
support the bill um as
 
00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:33.240 align:start position:0%
amended um I've been around here long
 
00:24:37.990 --> 00:24:38.000 align:start position:0%
enough to know that when oplc was
 
00:24:39.909 --> 00:24:39.919 align:start position:0%
created it was
 
00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
to put together a place where
 
00:24:46.990 --> 00:24:47.000 align:start position:0%
we we're going to take the office
 
00:24:50.070 --> 00:24:50.080 align:start position:0%
functions that all the boards had
 
00:24:52.350 --> 00:24:52.360 align:start position:0%
duplicative that they were doing with
 
00:24:55.269 --> 00:24:55.279 align:start position:0%
printers staff answering phones whatever
 
00:24:57.870 --> 00:24:57.880 align:start position:0%
it was when this was created with the
 
00:25:00.549 --> 00:25:00.559 align:start position:0%
boards all had their own
 
00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
separate board and separate
 
00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:08.640 align:start position:0%
staff this was to create something that
 
00:25:10.430 --> 00:25:10.440 align:start position:0%
would take those functions and
 
00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:11.870 align:start position:0%
would take those functions and
centralize

00:25:11.870 --> 00:25:11.880 align:start position:0%
centralize
 
00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:16.000 align:start position:0%
them and what I'm seeing here is the
 
00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:20.120 align:start position:0%
office trying to continually grow away
 
00:25:21.990 --> 00:25:22.000 align:start position:0%
from what it was originally intended for
 
00:25:23.470 --> 00:25:23.480 align:start position:0%
when we put this
 
00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:26.960 align:start position:0%
together and I'm not
 
00:25:29.070 --> 00:25:29.080 align:start position:0%
sure back when when these changes were
 
00:25:31.269 --> 00:25:31.279 align:start position:0%
made if I would have agreed with it if I
 
00:25:34.590 --> 00:25:34.600 align:start position:0%
knew where we were going from
 
00:25:37.269 --> 00:25:37.279 align:start position:0%
there because I'm watching
 
00:25:41.389 --> 00:25:41.399 align:start position:0%
as the functions keep
 
00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:45.200 align:start position:0%
growing out of this office
 
00:25:48.909 --> 00:25:48.919 align:start position:0%
and I think we all when we did this were
 
00:25:51.870 --> 00:25:51.880 align:start position:0%
adamant that the boards stayed separate
 
00:25:56.990 --> 00:25:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:59.549 --> 00:25:59.559 align:start position:0%
functions and had their own autonomy as
 
00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
to what they were doing going
 
00:26:05.310 --> 00:26:05.320 align:start position:0%
forward and starting to slowly make
 
00:26:07.870 --> 00:26:07.880 align:start position:0%
these boards into advisory boards I I I
 
00:26:11.070 --> 00:26:11.080 align:start position:0%
can't agree with so I I'll support the
 
00:26:14.110 --> 00:26:14.120 align:start position:0%
amendment but not the bill as
 
00:26:17.669 --> 00:26:17.679 align:start position:0%
amended representative leus yeah um I
 
00:26:18.990 --> 00:26:19.000 align:start position:0%
understand that I just want to point out
 
00:26:20.389 --> 00:26:20.399 align:start position:0%
that first of all the concept of
 
00:26:22.990 --> 00:26:23.000 align:start position:0%
advisory boards isn't new with this bill
 
00:26:24.310 --> 00:26:24.320 align:start position:0%
I don't know when it started but there
 
00:26:27.230 --> 00:26:27.240 align:start position:0%
are a number of existing advisory boards
 
00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:29.149 align:start position:0%
are a number of existing advisory boards
um

00:26:29.149 --> 00:26:29.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:32.830 --> 00:26:32.840 align:start position:0%
and and it's a you know having them have
 
00:26:36.029 --> 00:26:36.039 align:start position:0%
autonomy in one sense makes sense but um
 
00:26:38.029 --> 00:26:38.039 align:start position:0%
it also especially for a small number of
 
00:26:40.029 --> 00:26:40.039 align:start position:0%
lenses presents real problems of
 
00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:42.640 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest and that was uh
 
00:26:44.230 --> 00:26:44.240 align:start position:0%
this was intended to
 
00:26:48.029 --> 00:26:48.039 align:start position:0%
address and the other thing is that um
 
00:26:49.470 --> 00:26:49.480 align:start position:0%
there are actually quite a few states
 
00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:50.640 align:start position:0%
where they don't even have advisory
 
00:26:52.669 --> 00:26:52.679 align:start position:0%
boards the whole licensing schemes in
 
00:26:55.909 --> 00:26:55.919 align:start position:0%
the bureaucracy and the rul making
 
00:26:59.190 --> 00:26:59.200 align:start position:0%
process um and so New Hampshire
 
00:27:01.029 --> 00:27:01.039 align:start position:0%
actually more towards regulatory boards
 
00:27:02.710 --> 00:27:02.720 align:start position:0%
and even advisory boards in quite a
 
00:27:04.830 --> 00:27:04.840 align:start position:0%
number of other states it's kind of a
 
00:27:07.669 --> 00:27:07.679 align:start position:0%
compromise and especially again for the
 
00:27:07.679 --> 00:27:08.750 align:start position:0%
compromise and especially again for the
um

00:27:08.750 --> 00:27:08.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:11.310 --> 00:27:11.320 align:start position:0%
smaller um professions I mean we're not
 
00:27:13.070 --> 00:27:13.080 align:start position:0%
looking at doing this for the Board of
 
00:27:14.710 --> 00:27:14.720 align:start position:0%
Medicine or nursing or anything like
 
00:27:17.269 --> 00:27:17.279 align:start position:0%
that because for one thing the potential
 
00:27:19.510 --> 00:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
for conflict is dramatically less there
 
00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:22.000 align:start position:0%
just because the large number of lenses
 
00:27:25.269 --> 00:27:25.279 align:start position:0%
so that that was what was behind this
 
00:27:32.110 --> 00:27:32.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:35.440 align:start position:0%
it thank you madam chair um
 
00:27:37.630 --> 00:27:37.640 align:start position:0%
representative lake has made reference
 
00:27:41.389 --> 00:27:41.399 align:start position:0%
to ways that board members can make
 
00:27:44.149 --> 00:27:44.159 align:start position:0%
objections that they have known I assume
 
00:27:46.750 --> 00:27:46.760 align:start position:0%
part of what he's referring to is the
 
00:27:50.509 --> 00:27:50.519 align:start position:0%
oplc oversight committee that this this
 
00:27:54.430 --> 00:27:54.440 align:start position:0%
committee was instrumental in creating
 
00:27:56.990 --> 00:27:57.000 align:start position:0%
however we heard from some of the boards
 
00:27:59.630 --> 00:27:59.640 align:start position:0%
who were involved in this bill that
 
00:28:01.990 --> 00:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
until they got involved in this bill
 
00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:04.240 align:start position:0%
they were unaware that that venue
 
00:28:07.590 --> 00:28:07.600 align:start position:0%
existed and I'm not sure if how many of
 
00:28:10.110 --> 00:28:10.120 align:start position:0%
the other boards are aware that they
 
00:28:12.430 --> 00:28:12.440 align:start position:0%
have that
 
00:28:15.070 --> 00:28:15.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity um one other thing and I
 
00:28:18.750 --> 00:28:18.760 align:start position:0%
apologize for this because uh I was not
 
00:28:20.870 --> 00:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
able to make many of your subcommittee
 
00:28:24.070 --> 00:28:24.080 align:start position:0%
meetings and I realized that this was in
 
00:28:27.070 --> 00:28:27.080 align:start position:0%
the bill itself but in the amendment on
 
00:28:32.389 --> 00:28:32.399 align:start position:0%
page five down lines 23 through
 
00:28:35.470 --> 00:28:35.480 align:start position:0%
27 I'm I'm just curious if your
 
00:28:38.269 --> 00:28:38.279 align:start position:0%
subcommittee investigated how it's
 
00:28:41.029 --> 00:28:41.039 align:start position:0%
possible for someone to do acupuncture
 
00:28:45.230 --> 00:28:45.240 align:start position:0%
by tele medicine that just kind of blew
 
00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:47.430 align:start position:0%
by tele medicine that just kind of blew
my

00:28:47.430 --> 00:28:47.440 align:start position:0%
my
 
00:28:51.029 --> 00:28:51.039 align:start position:0%
mind I believe that's more into the the
 
00:28:53.669 --> 00:28:53.679 align:start position:0%
tone of dietary nutritional and herbal
 
00:28:56.549 --> 00:28:56.559 align:start position:0%
therapies and lifestyle counseling than
 
00:28:58.630 --> 00:28:58.640 align:start position:0%
actual acupuncture
 
00:29:02.590 --> 00:29:02.600 align:start position:0%
just those just those items well that's
 
00:29:04.750 --> 00:29:04.760 align:start position:0%
that's part of the scope of practice
 
00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:07.320 align:start position:0%
okay I mean yeah I mean doctors can do
 
00:29:09.070 --> 00:29:09.080 align:start position:0%
tele medicine but I think nobody
 
00:29:10.389 --> 00:29:10.399 align:start position:0%
believes they're going to do surgery
 
00:29:12.190 --> 00:29:12.200 align:start position:0%
that way at least at this
 
00:29:15.909 --> 00:29:15.919 align:start position:0%
point robot surger consultation but
 
00:29:18.750 --> 00:29:18.760 align:start position:0%
acupuncture to me is much more physical
 
00:29:20.990 --> 00:29:21.000 align:start position:0%
yeah I think it it largely is but there
 
00:29:22.990 --> 00:29:23.000 align:start position:0%
are other aspects as the chair uh
 
00:29:25.909 --> 00:29:25.919 align:start position:0%
mentioned if I could uh there those are
 
00:29:27.549 --> 00:29:27.559 align:start position:0%
those items are specifically mentioned
 
00:29:31.669 --> 00:29:31.679 align:start position:0%
in the scope of practice on that page so
 
00:29:34.190 --> 00:29:34.200 align:start position:0%
yeah representative laus yeah well when
 
00:29:35.870 --> 00:29:35.880 align:start position:0%
I made my comments actually I wasn't
 
00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:39.760 align:start position:0%
thinking of the um the op oplc oversight
 
00:29:40.950 --> 00:29:40.960 align:start position:0%
committee although that is definitely
 
00:29:43.789 --> 00:29:43.799 align:start position:0%
another venue what I was thinking of was
 
00:29:49.710 --> 00:29:49.720 align:start position:0%
the um you 541 541a process of uh public
 
00:29:52.990 --> 00:29:53.000 align:start position:0%
comment public hearing and then jel car
 
00:29:54.590 --> 00:29:54.600 align:start position:0%
and um I don't think the board would
 
00:29:56.549 --> 00:29:56.559 align:start position:0%
want to be I mean I don't you never know
 
00:29:57.590 --> 00:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
who's going to be running the board in
 
00:29:59.149 --> 00:29:59.159 align:start position:0%
the future I understand that but I don't
 
00:30:01.630 --> 00:30:01.640 align:start position:0%
think any Board office I'm sorry office
 
00:30:03.630 --> 00:30:03.640 align:start position:0%
of oplc is going to want to be in the
 
00:30:07.149 --> 00:30:07.159 align:start position:0%
position of having a strong unified
 
00:30:09.669 --> 00:30:09.679 align:start position:0%
opposition from a board on the rules
 
00:30:11.070 --> 00:30:11.080 align:start position:0%
they're creating related to that
 
00:30:13.269 --> 00:30:13.279 align:start position:0%
profession unless they've got an awfully
 
00:30:17.190 --> 00:30:17.200 align:start position:0%
good argument for it um and so I think
 
00:30:19.470 --> 00:30:19.480 align:start position:0%
and I understand the
 
00:30:21.789 --> 00:30:21.799 align:start position:0%
concern of you know feeling that you're
 
00:30:23.870 --> 00:30:23.880 align:start position:0%
ging up control and that you have
 
00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:25.200 align:start position:0%
somebody up there that'll do whatever
 
00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:26.760 align:start position:0%
they want but I don't think that's
 
00:30:28.870 --> 00:30:28.880 align:start position:0%
actually a realistic
 
00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:32.240 align:start position:0%
concern because um you know oplc is
 
00:30:33.630 --> 00:30:33.640 align:start position:0%
going to be constrained on what they can
 
00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
do and what they can get adopted that
 
00:30:38.590 --> 00:30:38.600 align:start position:0%
was that was what I was thinking of
 
00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:43.120 align:start position:0%
okay representative Schmid
 
00:30:47.909 --> 00:30:47.919 align:start position:0%
Gro thank you madam chair so um I I I've
 
00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:50.080 align:start position:0%
been on this board on this committee for
 
00:30:53.950 --> 00:30:53.960 align:start position:0%
18 years okay I I was here before o PLC
 
00:30:57.549 --> 00:30:57.559 align:start position:0%
was here um I wasn't here before Noah
 
00:30:59.990 --> 00:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
was here but it sometimes it seems that
 
00:31:03.509 --> 00:31:03.519 align:start position:0%
way but the bottom line is that I share
 
00:31:05.389 --> 00:31:05.399 align:start position:0%
the concern that representative goalie
 
00:31:09.389 --> 00:31:09.399 align:start position:0%
addressed that we we on were
 
00:31:12.110 --> 00:31:12.120 align:start position:0%
already we were apprehensive about the
 
00:31:15.029 --> 00:31:15.039 align:start position:0%
idea that the oplc was kind of being
 
00:31:17.310 --> 00:31:17.320 align:start position:0%
given more and more and more Authority
 
00:31:20.029 --> 00:31:20.039 align:start position:0%
and especially the executive director
 
00:31:21.789 --> 00:31:21.799 align:start position:0%
when everybody was saying well the
 
00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:24.240 align:start position:0%
executive director may be very
 
00:31:26.430 --> 00:31:26.440 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable about this profession or
 
00:31:27.909 --> 00:31:27.919 align:start position:0%
that profession but certainly not about
 
00:31:30.830 --> 00:31:30.840 align:start position:0%
about all professions so how is he or
 
00:31:33.509 --> 00:31:33.519 align:start position:0%
she going to be able to write the rules
 
00:31:36.950 --> 00:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
and so forth and so on so uh and we
 
00:31:39.350 --> 00:31:39.360 align:start position:0%
didn't know how that was going to work
 
00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:42.240 align:start position:0%
out but I I think doing this at this
 
00:31:46.149 --> 00:31:46.159 align:start position:0%
time is the right thing to do because uh
 
00:31:48.350 --> 00:31:48.360 align:start position:0%
some of us who've been here for a long
 
00:31:51.549 --> 00:31:51.559 align:start position:0%
time and and had these concerns and see
 
00:31:55.350 --> 00:31:55.360 align:start position:0%
this very fine product uh and an
 
00:31:56.950 --> 00:31:56.960 align:start position:0%
understanding of where we're trying to
 
00:31:59.590 --> 00:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
go um and maybe we're going to be around
 
00:32:03.190 --> 00:32:03.200 align:start position:0%
for a little bit longer I hope so anyway
 
00:32:05.549 --> 00:32:05.559 align:start position:0%
and the thing is it's time to do it now
 
00:32:09.470 --> 00:32:09.480 align:start position:0%
while we have the people here that have
 
00:32:12.430 --> 00:32:12.440 align:start position:0%
a b the past experience and are going to
 
00:32:15.870 --> 00:32:15.880 align:start position:0%
be here to nurse made this operation a
 
00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
little bit longer about how it will work
 
00:32:21.990 --> 00:32:22.000 align:start position:0%
out and and I think we have to do it
 
00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:25.840 align:start position:0%
because uh otherwise we're taking the
 
00:32:28.509 --> 00:32:28.519 align:start position:0%
risk that new people will come in won't
 
00:32:31.149 --> 00:32:31.159 align:start position:0%
know anything about this uh won't have
 
00:32:34.909 --> 00:32:34.919 align:start position:0%
our past experience and the the and
 
00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
won't have the the sense of doing this
 
00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:40.440 align:start position:0%
thing right and
 
00:32:45.389 --> 00:32:45.399 align:start position:0%
having a this is a compromise and more
 
00:32:49.590 --> 00:32:49.600 align:start position:0%
than a compromise it is a marriage of um
 
00:32:52.830 --> 00:32:52.840 align:start position:0%
of two concepts uh that I think can and
 
00:32:55.750 --> 00:32:55.760 align:start position:0%
will work if we if we are here to guide
 
00:32:59.909 --> 00:32:59.919 align:start position:0%
it and and keep an eye on it as it as it
 
00:33:03.669 --> 00:33:03.679 align:start position:0%
goes through the first um months or
 
00:33:08.750 --> 00:33:08.760 align:start position:0%
years of doing this so let's do it now
 
00:33:11.350 --> 00:33:11.360 align:start position:0%
and um and if there are problems let's
 
00:33:13.909 --> 00:33:13.919 align:start position:0%
we will we'll be here to fix it uh for a
 
00:33:16.750 --> 00:33:16.760 align:start position:0%
couple of more years thank you
 
00:33:19.230 --> 00:33:19.240 align:start position:0%
represent thank you I wish was I was as
 
00:33:21.350 --> 00:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
optimistic as repes representative
 
00:33:22.629 --> 00:33:22.639 align:start position:0%
Schmidt that we're going to be able to
 
00:33:25.590 --> 00:33:25.600 align:start position:0%
guide anything after this um because I
 
00:33:27.950 --> 00:33:27.960 align:start position:0%
can tell you that's not going to happen
 
00:33:30.590 --> 00:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
um and I will vote for the amendment I
 
00:33:32.830 --> 00:33:32.840 align:start position:0%
will not support the bill because there
 
00:33:35.070 --> 00:33:35.080 align:start position:0%
is disagreement in two of the boards as
 
00:33:36.310 --> 00:33:36.320 align:start position:0%
to whether or not they should be
 
00:33:38.669 --> 00:33:38.679 align:start position:0%
advisory boards I've received phone
 
00:33:40.710 --> 00:33:40.720 align:start position:0%
calls from acupuncturist who do not want
 
00:33:42.870 --> 00:33:42.880 align:start position:0%
this to be an Advisory Board I think
 
00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:45.240 align:start position:0%
some of us have also receive those calls
 
00:33:47.149 --> 00:33:47.159 align:start position:0%
I don't want to force anything onto
 
00:33:49.750 --> 00:33:49.760 align:start position:0%
anybody which is why we have an oplc
 
00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:51.760 align:start position:0%
oversight committee and I think they
 
00:33:54.629 --> 00:33:54.639 align:start position:0%
should be part of that and I recognize
 
00:33:56.509 --> 00:33:56.519 align:start position:0%
the amount of work that this that this
 
00:33:58.549 --> 00:33:58.559 align:start position:0%
represents it's not easy to do the
 
00:34:01.710 --> 00:34:01.720 align:start position:0%
things that you have to do um and I also
 
00:34:04.830 --> 00:34:04.840 align:start position:0%
find it ironic that oplc can take all
 
00:34:08.149 --> 00:34:08.159 align:start position:0%
this on and there's no fiscal note but
 
00:34:09.790 --> 00:34:09.800 align:start position:0%
we want music
 
00:34:12.310 --> 00:34:12.320 align:start position:0%
therapy um license and they need a
 
00:34:14.629 --> 00:34:14.639 align:start position:0%
person so I have there's a big
 
00:34:17.909 --> 00:34:17.919 align:start position:0%
discrepancy there and lastly this bill
 
00:34:20.909 --> 00:34:20.919 align:start position:0%
did not come from oplc or from the
 
00:34:23.550 --> 00:34:23.560 align:start position:0%
boards it came from somewhere else and
 
00:34:27.030 --> 00:34:27.040 align:start position:0%
I'm not particularly keen on having that
 
00:34:28.909 --> 00:34:28.919 align:start position:0%
as the reason that we're going to do
 
00:34:31.790 --> 00:34:31.800 align:start position:0%
something so that's that's where I'm
 
00:34:33.310 --> 00:34:33.320 align:start position:0%
going so I support the amendment I will
 
00:34:35.710 --> 00:34:35.720 align:start position:0%
not support the
 
00:34:39.149 --> 00:34:39.159 align:start position:0%
bill represent leus thank you uh just on
 
00:34:41.109 --> 00:34:41.119 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note part oplc is already
 
00:34:41.119 --> 00:34:42.589 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note part oplc is already
responsible

00:34:42.589 --> 00:34:42.599 align:start position:0%
responsible
 
00:34:46.190 --> 00:34:46.200 align:start position:0%
for um all the investigation the
 
00:34:48.149 --> 00:34:48.159 align:start position:0%
administrative part preparing everything
 
00:34:51.030 --> 00:34:51.040 align:start position:0%
for the board hearings and all of that
 
00:34:52.950 --> 00:34:52.960 align:start position:0%
um the only additional thing they would
 
00:34:56.069 --> 00:34:56.079 align:start position:0%
really have would be um working on the
 
00:34:57.310 --> 00:34:57.320 align:start position:0%
rul making but they would have been
 
00:34:58.870 --> 00:34:58.880 align:start position:0%
consult in with the even if it was a
 
00:35:01.069 --> 00:35:01.079 align:start position:0%
regulatory board they'd have to work the
 
00:35:03.230 --> 00:35:03.240 align:start position:0%
board with the board on the rul making
 
00:35:05.870 --> 00:35:05.880 align:start position:0%
even if the board had the authority so I
 
00:35:07.829 --> 00:35:07.839 align:start position:0%
think that you know the basic idea is it
 
00:35:09.670 --> 00:35:09.680 align:start position:0%
would it's not going to take them any
 
00:35:11.470 --> 00:35:11.480 align:start position:0%
significant amount may you know whether
 
00:35:13.349 --> 00:35:13.359 align:start position:0%
it's May almost be less work if there's
 
00:35:15.270 --> 00:35:15.280 align:start position:0%
fewer board meetings I don't know that
 
00:35:20.589 --> 00:35:20.599 align:start position:0%
there will be um so there's that and um
 
00:35:24.270 --> 00:35:24.280 align:start position:0%
as far as the acupuncturist go you know
 
00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:25.800 align:start position:0%
we had a few people that were actually
 
00:35:27.109 --> 00:35:27.119 align:start position:0%
nobody showed up for the subcommittee
 
00:35:28.470 --> 00:35:28.480 align:start position:0%
meetings and opposition they were all
 
00:35:31.230 --> 00:35:31.240 align:start position:0%
for it vast majority of the email I got
 
00:35:33.430 --> 00:35:33.440 align:start position:0%
was actually in support there was some
 
00:35:36.990 --> 00:35:37.000 align:start position:0%
opposed um you know I I don't know that
 
00:35:39.750 --> 00:35:39.760 align:start position:0%
we require unanimity in the profession
 
00:35:42.670 --> 00:35:42.680 align:start position:0%
before we do something like this because
 
00:35:45.190 --> 00:35:45.200 align:start position:0%
again it's it's to make sure that the
 
00:35:47.069 --> 00:35:47.079 align:start position:0%
license the the professions licens
 
00:35:48.630 --> 00:35:48.640 align:start position:0%
appropriately and the board operates
 
00:35:50.670 --> 00:35:50.680 align:start position:0%
well and they don't necessarily all
 
00:35:53.470 --> 00:35:53.480 align:start position:0%
agree on how to go about that either
 
00:35:56.910 --> 00:35:56.920 align:start position:0%
so representative goalie and then Brown
 
00:36:00.550 --> 00:36:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:04.030 --> 00:36:04.040 align:start position:0%
here I look back at the testimony when
 
00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
The Honorable Ned Gordon came here and
 
00:36:08.069 --> 00:36:08.079 align:start position:0%
testified in opposition to the guardian
 
00:36:12.150 --> 00:36:12.160 align:start position:0%
at Liam he had some great
 
00:36:14.750 --> 00:36:14.760 align:start position:0%
points as to why they shouldn't
 
00:36:17.030 --> 00:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
be this is someone who's been around a
 
00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
long time I have great respect
 
00:36:22.870 --> 00:36:22.880 align:start position:0%
for and I just look
 
00:36:25.750 --> 00:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
and I look at the changes representative
 
00:36:28.550 --> 00:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
Schmidt I look and I say
 
00:36:29.910 --> 00:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
if it ain't
 
00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
broke try and fix it we tried that
 
00:36:35.910 --> 00:36:35.920 align:start position:0%
numerous times as we all know with the
 
00:36:38.470 --> 00:36:38.480 align:start position:0%
retirement system and look where it took
 
00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:41.200 align:start position:0%
us it took a long time to get it back to
 
00:36:43.589 --> 00:36:43.599 align:start position:0%
where it needed to
 
00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
be so and looking at this I say if it
 
00:36:52.150 --> 00:36:52.160 align:start position:0%
ain't broke don't try and fix it I'm not
 
00:36:53.750 --> 00:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
gonna I I'll vote for the amendment but
 
00:36:55.230 --> 00:36:55.240 align:start position:0%
not the
 
00:36:58.109 --> 00:36:58.119 align:start position:0%
bill representative Brown
 
00:37:00.510 --> 00:37:00.520 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um I appreciate
 
00:37:02.190 --> 00:37:02.200 align:start position:0%
what representative goalie said because
 
00:37:04.510 --> 00:37:04.520 align:start position:0%
some of us don't know the history in
 
00:37:06.910 --> 00:37:06.920 align:start position:0%
here and sometimes that would be nice to
 
00:37:09.109 --> 00:37:09.119 align:start position:0%
know maybe a little earlier than
 
00:37:12.349 --> 00:37:12.359 align:start position:0%
today that's not you personally of
 
00:37:12.359 --> 00:37:14.630 align:start position:0%
today that's not you personally of
course

00:37:14.630 --> 00:37:14.640 align:start position:0%
course
 
00:37:16.990 --> 00:37:17.000 align:start position:0%
um in the subcommittee we did have quite
 
00:37:18.470 --> 00:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
a bit of conversation as representative
 
00:37:20.950 --> 00:37:20.960 align:start position:0%
Lea said about the potential liabilities
 
00:37:22.510 --> 00:37:22.520 align:start position:0%
for the boards as they stand because of
 
00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
that court case that happened elsewhere
 
00:37:25.950 --> 00:37:25.960 align:start position:0%
in the country and I think that there
 
00:37:27.870 --> 00:37:27.880 align:start position:0%
was I think there was pretty much
 
00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:30.160 align:start position:0%
agreement that it wasn't a bad thing to
 
00:37:33.390 --> 00:37:33.400 align:start position:0%
try to uh fix that so that the The
 
00:37:34.910 --> 00:37:34.920 align:start position:0%
Volunteers in these boards wouldn't be
 
00:37:37.790 --> 00:37:37.800 align:start position:0%
subject to that kind of H lawsuit and
 
00:37:39.309 --> 00:37:39.319 align:start position:0%
that's part of why going to advisory
 
00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:42.720 align:start position:0%
boards uh would eliminate
 
00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
that the other piece was we re I think
 
00:37:48.589 --> 00:37:48.599 align:start position:0%
we did a really good balance
 
00:37:51.510 --> 00:37:51.520 align:start position:0%
on saying we have too many Market
 
00:37:53.430 --> 00:37:53.440 align:start position:0%
participants on the board versus having
 
00:37:56.750 --> 00:37:56.760 align:start position:0%
no expertise in the field on the board I
 
00:37:59.510 --> 00:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
think we balance that pretty well um we
 
00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
didn't stick with the uh uh the numbers
 
00:38:04.150 --> 00:38:04.160 align:start position:0%
of three as it came down it was
 
00:38:06.069 --> 00:38:06.079 align:start position:0%
represented when the build the bill was
 
00:38:08.150 --> 00:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
presented I think we pushed them all up
 
00:38:10.710 --> 00:38:10.720 align:start position:0%
to five as opposed to maybe seven or 11
 
00:38:14.349 --> 00:38:14.359 align:start position:0%
because of Quorum issues and we did try
 
00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:17.280 align:start position:0%
to keep it I think pretty fair on the
 
00:38:19.390 --> 00:38:19.400 align:start position:0%
balance as I said between Market
 
00:38:22.510 --> 00:38:22.520 align:start position:0%
participants and and those that may uh
 
00:38:24.230 --> 00:38:24.240 align:start position:0%
that aren't in the market and to get a
 
00:38:26.309 --> 00:38:26.319 align:start position:0%
balance on opinions in there so I think
 
00:38:27.990 --> 00:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
we did well with that
 
00:38:30.470 --> 00:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
I think I said that twice yes
 
00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:31.790 align:start position:0%
I think I said that twice yes
representative

00:38:31.790 --> 00:38:31.800 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:38:35.309 --> 00:38:35.319 align:start position:0%
gold you madam chair um having been on
 
00:38:38.550 --> 00:38:38.560 align:start position:0%
the committee I really appreciate the
 
00:38:41.829 --> 00:38:41.839 align:start position:0%
comments made by representative goalie
 
00:38:43.670 --> 00:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
and representative Schmidt in terms of
 
00:38:45.910 --> 00:38:45.920 align:start position:0%
the history and I'm thankful for the
 
00:38:48.109 --> 00:38:48.119 align:start position:0%
institutional knowledge they carry and
 
00:38:53.790 --> 00:38:53.800 align:start position:0%
and share with us all I also um
 
00:38:56.870 --> 00:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
experienced a great deal of listening
 
00:38:57.990 --> 00:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
and negot
 
00:39:01.349 --> 00:39:01.359 align:start position:0%
negotiating to meet the needs
 
00:39:04.390 --> 00:39:04.400 align:start position:0%
of of of the situation I mean we have to
 
00:39:06.550 --> 00:39:06.560 align:start position:0%
remember that this amendment started out
 
00:39:09.069 --> 00:39:09.079 align:start position:0%
with a bill that was repealing
 
00:39:11.270 --> 00:39:11.280 align:start position:0%
everything and we had to get through all
 
00:39:14.109 --> 00:39:14.119 align:start position:0%
the how to repeal the repeals and for
 
00:39:15.910 --> 00:39:15.920 align:start position:0%
this dyslexic mind that was an
 
00:39:19.030 --> 00:39:19.040 align:start position:0%
incredible activity of keeping it all
 
00:39:23.790 --> 00:39:23.800 align:start position:0%
straight but um at the end of the
 
00:39:27.030 --> 00:39:27.040 align:start position:0%
day I just have to say that I agree that
 
00:39:29.270 --> 00:39:29.280 align:start position:0%
ad advisory or
 
00:39:32.190 --> 00:39:32.200 align:start position:0%
regulatory are words more than their
 
00:39:35.710 --> 00:39:35.720 align:start position:0%
power and that uh I really appreciate
 
00:39:39.030 --> 00:39:39.040 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt's words and his
 
00:39:41.030 --> 00:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
admonition excuse me that it's not the
 
00:39:42.710 --> 00:39:42.720 align:start position:0%
intent of this committee or any of the
 
00:39:45.109 --> 00:39:45.119 align:start position:0%
legislation we send forward to strip
 
00:39:48.030 --> 00:39:48.040 align:start position:0%
power away from people who are doing
 
00:39:49.790 --> 00:39:49.800 align:start position:0%
such an important task and I know
 
00:39:52.750 --> 00:39:52.760 align:start position:0%
representative mangipudi has pointed out
 
00:39:54.990 --> 00:39:55.000 align:start position:0%
uh in regards to this in the past that
 
00:39:57.550 --> 00:39:57.560 align:start position:0%
these people on these boards are vol
 
00:40:00.630 --> 00:40:00.640 align:start position:0%
teers and they're not paid to do so and
 
00:40:04.430 --> 00:40:04.440 align:start position:0%
um but in terms of it's not broken why
 
00:40:08.270 --> 00:40:08.280 align:start position:0%
fix it uh I was going through the the
 
00:40:11.870 --> 00:40:11.880 align:start position:0%
audit of the legislative budget audit
 
00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:12.870 align:start position:0%
audit of the legislative budget audit
something

00:40:12.870 --> 00:40:12.880 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:40:17.030 --> 00:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
something yes yesterday and um a lot of
 
00:40:19.270 --> 00:40:19.280 align:start position:0%
recommendations in there of delays
 
00:40:21.430 --> 00:40:21.440 align:start position:0%
things that are happening that are
 
00:40:24.430 --> 00:40:24.440 align:start position:0%
making the licensing process not go as
 
00:40:27.390 --> 00:40:27.400 align:start position:0%
smoothly as it can go and a lot of that
 
00:40:30.630 --> 00:40:30.640 align:start position:0%
has to do with functions that oplc can
 
00:40:34.550 --> 00:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
can do and does do and you know I just
 
00:40:37.109 --> 00:40:37.119 align:start position:0%
keep coming back to that change is hard
 
00:40:39.589 --> 00:40:39.599 align:start position:0%
for people and that the changes we've
 
00:40:43.470 --> 00:40:43.480 align:start position:0%
put the boards through with creating the
 
00:40:45.750 --> 00:40:45.760 align:start position:0%
office which my colleagues have all
 
00:40:47.990 --> 00:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
shared about the incredible work and
 
00:40:50.589 --> 00:40:50.599 align:start position:0%
thought that went into doing that it's a
 
00:40:53.390 --> 00:40:53.400 align:start position:0%
lot for people to go through and you
 
00:40:55.390 --> 00:40:55.400 align:start position:0%
know I think this committee's made a
 
00:40:57.309 --> 00:40:57.319 align:start position:0%
commitment to not keep pushing these
 
00:40:59.870 --> 00:40:59.880 align:start position:0%
changes but we did have this big Bill
 
00:41:02.309 --> 00:41:02.319 align:start position:0%
asking us to do some pretty serious
 
00:41:04.150 --> 00:41:04.160 align:start position:0%
changes and I think we've done our best
 
00:41:06.710 --> 00:41:06.720 align:start position:0%
to temper that and to make it reasonable
 
00:41:09.349 --> 00:41:09.359 align:start position:0%
for the boards and I will say that I did
 
00:41:11.670 --> 00:41:11.680 align:start position:0%
have an opportunity to follow up with
 
00:41:13.069 --> 00:41:13.079 align:start position:0%
the woman who did come to the
 
00:41:15.710 --> 00:41:15.720 align:start position:0%
subcommittee from the Midwifery board
 
00:41:18.430 --> 00:41:18.440 align:start position:0%
after that part of the exec session was
 
00:41:22.430 --> 00:41:22.440 align:start position:0%
done and she felt much better about the
 
00:41:24.630 --> 00:41:24.640 align:start position:0%
compromise process that we went through
 
00:41:26.750 --> 00:41:26.760 align:start position:0%
with her and adding some of those seats
 
00:41:29.349 --> 00:41:29.359 align:start position:0%
back in and making changes that um that
 
00:41:31.309 --> 00:41:31.319 align:start position:0%
would work well for
 
00:41:35.790 --> 00:41:35.800 align:start position:0%
them thank you everybody all right any
 
00:41:39.030 --> 00:41:39.040 align:start position:0%
representative us just on the point of
 
00:41:41.950 --> 00:41:41.960 align:start position:0%
um The Guardian mlam board uh you know
 
00:41:44.030 --> 00:41:44.040 align:start position:0%
we we saw what the bill originally
 
00:41:45.589 --> 00:41:45.599 align:start position:0%
proposed it's my understanding that was
 
00:41:47.510 --> 00:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
actually created in consultation with
 
00:41:50.589 --> 00:41:50.599 align:start position:0%
oplc but
 
00:41:54.390 --> 00:41:54.400 align:start position:0%
um and you know that didn't look right
 
00:41:56.870 --> 00:41:56.880 align:start position:0%
what was in there and um a lot of work
 
00:41:59.270 --> 00:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
went into that and I know uh member of
 
00:42:00.790 --> 00:42:00.800 align:start position:0%
the committee representative Gul who had
 
00:42:03.030 --> 00:42:03.040 align:start position:0%
experience in that area provided a lot
 
00:42:05.790 --> 00:42:05.800 align:start position:0%
of input on the changes we made to the
 
00:42:08.470 --> 00:42:08.480 align:start position:0%
board membership to try and do the right
 
00:42:12.630 --> 00:42:12.640 align:start position:0%
thing and I think we did so just on that
 
00:42:14.870 --> 00:42:14.880 align:start position:0%
point anyone
 
00:42:18.190 --> 00:42:18.200 align:start position:0%
else okay the motion yes represent
 
00:42:20.230 --> 00:42:20.240 align:start position:0%
goalie thank you madam chair I hate to
 
00:42:23.510 --> 00:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
drag the cell but just one last point is
 
00:42:24.990 --> 00:42:25.000 align:start position:0%
and I was looking for it I can't find it
 
00:42:28.230 --> 00:42:28.240 align:start position:0%
right offand that we were given
 
00:42:31.630 --> 00:42:31.640 align:start position:0%
some information from oplc on boards and
 
00:42:37.150 --> 00:42:37.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:39.790 --> 00:42:39.800 align:start position:0%
and in their criteria as to what they
 
00:42:43.390 --> 00:42:43.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:45.390 --> 00:42:45.400 align:start position:0%
boards and looking at the number of
 
00:42:48.190 --> 00:42:48.200 align:start position:0%
lenses and a number of those boards
 
00:42:50.990 --> 00:42:51.000 align:start position:0%
there were a lot more boards that met
 
00:42:54.030 --> 00:42:54.040 align:start position:0%
the criteria of having a small number of
 
00:42:58.430 --> 00:42:58.440 align:start position:0%
lenses in them I just have to question
 
00:43:00.790 --> 00:43:00.800 align:start position:0%
why if it's so
 
00:43:03.790 --> 00:43:03.800 align:start position:0%
important to convert these boards to
 
00:43:05.190 --> 00:43:05.200 align:start position:0%
advisory because we're worried about
 
00:43:07.670 --> 00:43:07.680 align:start position:0%
legal actions that only a handful of
 
00:43:10.829 --> 00:43:10.839 align:start position:0%
boards were chosen out of those numerous
 
00:43:12.990 --> 00:43:13.000 align:start position:0%
boards that met the criteria of the
 
00:43:14.950 --> 00:43:14.960 align:start position:0%
numbers that they had talked about
 
00:43:16.470 --> 00:43:16.480 align:start position:0%
during the
 
00:43:19.589 --> 00:43:19.599 align:start position:0%
hearing why it was stopped there and not
 
00:43:21.790 --> 00:43:21.800 align:start position:0%
just include every single board that was
 
00:43:25.790 --> 00:43:25.800 align:start position:0%
with so many members or below so many
 
00:43:28.309 --> 00:43:28.319 align:start position:0%
members and make them all advisory at
 
00:43:31.150 --> 00:43:31.160 align:start position:0%
the same time and it wasn't done so I'm
 
00:43:32.750 --> 00:43:32.760 align:start position:0%
not sure where the motive is or what's
 
00:43:37.630 --> 00:43:37.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:41.950 --> 00:43:41.960 align:start position:0%
think that us being liable for lawsuits
 
00:43:46.309 --> 00:43:46.319 align:start position:0%
because of having a few number of lenes
 
00:43:46.319 --> 00:43:48.510 align:start position:0%
because of having a few number of lenes
per

00:43:48.510 --> 00:43:48.520 align:start position:0%
per
 
00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:50.349 align:start position:0%
per
board

00:43:50.349 --> 00:43:50.359 align:start position:0%
board
 
00:43:53.710 --> 00:43:53.720 align:start position:0%
um it's feasible because there's a lot
 
00:43:56.510 --> 00:43:56.520 align:start position:0%
more Boards out there and if this was
 
00:43:57.750 --> 00:43:57.760 align:start position:0%
really the ISS isue they would have
 
00:43:59.710 --> 00:43:59.720 align:start position:0%
brought all those boards forward Under
 
00:44:02.870 --> 00:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
One Roof um represent go I think at
 
00:44:05.309 --> 00:44:05.319 align:start position:0%
least some of the boards with smaller
 
00:44:07.390 --> 00:44:07.400 align:start position:0%
memberships that were not converted to
 
00:44:11.470 --> 00:44:11.480 align:start position:0%
advisory in this bill were combined with
 
00:44:13.950 --> 00:44:13.960 align:start position:0%
other boards in another bill and we
 
00:44:17.150 --> 00:44:17.160 align:start position:0%
rejected that uh the board of Podiatry
 
00:44:19.670 --> 00:44:19.680 align:start position:0%
for example would have qualified for
 
00:44:23.230 --> 00:44:23.240 align:start position:0%
this bill but it was intent the U the
 
00:44:25.230 --> 00:44:25.240 align:start position:0%
first pass was to combine it with the
 
00:44:28.150 --> 00:44:28.160 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine and we rejected that
 
00:44:31.390 --> 00:44:31.400 align:start position:0%
and so I would expect that a conversion
 
00:44:33.710 --> 00:44:33.720 align:start position:0%
to an Advisory Board would be considered
 
00:44:37.230 --> 00:44:37.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:40.430 --> 00:44:40.440 align:start position:0%
year there may be others I'm I don't
 
00:44:42.390 --> 00:44:42.400 align:start position:0%
know all of them off the top of my head
 
00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:43.710 align:start position:0%
know all of them off the top of my head
representative

00:44:43.710 --> 00:44:43.720 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:44:46.510 --> 00:44:46.520 align:start position:0%
schmit thank you madam chair well this
 
00:44:49.190 --> 00:44:49.200 align:start position:0%
is a very thought thoughtful disc uh
 
00:44:52.270 --> 00:44:52.280 align:start position:0%
discussion I really respect uh my
 
00:44:55.589 --> 00:44:55.599 align:start position:0%
colleagues uh and and I think that it's
 
00:44:58.630 --> 00:44:58.640 align:start position:0%
not a bad idea it's not one way or the
 
00:45:00.710 --> 00:45:00.720 align:start position:0%
other in terms of whether the the
 
00:45:03.549 --> 00:45:03.559 align:start position:0%
concept that we're trying here uh is the
 
00:45:06.829 --> 00:45:06.839 align:start position:0%
right idea uh uh but I think it
 
00:45:09.109 --> 00:45:09.119 align:start position:0%
certainly makes more sense to start with
 
00:45:13.910 --> 00:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
a few uh where we where we realize that
 
00:45:17.150 --> 00:45:17.160 align:start position:0%
we have problems of what's typically
 
00:45:19.710 --> 00:45:19.720 align:start position:0%
referred to as Manpower although it's
 
00:45:22.190 --> 00:45:22.200 align:start position:0%
it's not has anything do with men and
 
00:45:28.190 --> 00:45:28.200 align:start position:0%
women um and I I I remember that we had
 
00:45:30.309 --> 00:45:30.319 align:start position:0%
um quite a fight a couple of years ago
 
00:45:32.069 --> 00:45:32.079 align:start position:0%
with regard to court
 
00:45:35.109 --> 00:45:35.119 align:start position:0%
reporters um these are skilled
 
00:45:37.270 --> 00:45:37.280 align:start position:0%
professionals and those of us who sit on
 
00:45:40.349 --> 00:45:40.359 align:start position:0%
jail car or some other uh committees
 
00:45:43.670 --> 00:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
know what it's like to have a St court
 
00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:45.109 align:start position:0%
know what it's like to have a St court
reporter

00:45:45.109 --> 00:45:45.119 align:start position:0%
reporter
 
00:45:48.950 --> 00:45:48.960 align:start position:0%
stenographer uh uh making notes making
 
00:45:52.270 --> 00:45:52.280 align:start position:0%
the record and having a tape recorder
 
00:45:54.829 --> 00:45:54.839 align:start position:0%
the the work product difference is quite
 
00:45:57.470 --> 00:45:57.480 align:start position:0%
considerable in terms of quality
 
00:46:00.390 --> 00:46:00.400 align:start position:0%
and a court record that's got that's
 
00:46:02.270 --> 00:46:02.280 align:start position:0%
filled with
 
00:46:05.870 --> 00:46:05.880 align:start position:0%
inaudibles uh uh in the in the record it
 
00:46:07.790 --> 00:46:07.800 align:start position:0%
says inaudible what well what was the
 
00:46:10.349 --> 00:46:10.359 align:start position:0%
word that couldn't be heard that's the
 
00:46:11.950 --> 00:46:11.960 align:start position:0%
that's the only record that the court
 
00:46:14.549 --> 00:46:14.559 align:start position:0%
has in terms of somebody's life their
 
00:46:17.710 --> 00:46:17.720 align:start position:0%
profession whatever um but the bottom
 
00:46:19.510 --> 00:46:19.520 align:start position:0%
line is there aren't very many court
 
00:46:21.349 --> 00:46:21.359 align:start position:0%
reporters anymore because we took them
 
00:46:22.430 --> 00:46:22.440 align:start position:0%
out of the
 
00:46:25.390 --> 00:46:25.400 align:start position:0%
courts well we didn't do it but it was
 
00:46:29.190 --> 00:46:29.200 align:start position:0%
done by the legisl nature um and by the
 
00:46:30.670 --> 00:46:30.680 align:start position:0%
well I'm not sure about that as a matter
 
00:46:32.589 --> 00:46:32.599 align:start position:0%
of fact maybe in the courts the courts
 
00:46:35.309 --> 00:46:35.319 align:start position:0%
got rid of them to the to their own
 
00:46:39.190 --> 00:46:39.200 align:start position:0%
Peril um so I I I think it that this
 
00:46:41.549 --> 00:46:41.559 align:start position:0%
again is on the record and and we're
 
00:46:44.710 --> 00:46:44.720 align:start position:0%
we're we're creating a background
 
00:46:46.109 --> 00:46:46.119 align:start position:0%
against which we're doing this
 
00:46:48.829 --> 00:46:48.839 align:start position:0%
legislation so I think that if we're not
 
00:46:50.870 --> 00:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
doing all of them at the moment it's
 
00:46:53.710 --> 00:46:53.720 align:start position:0%
probably not a bad idea let's try it out
 
00:46:57.030 --> 00:46:57.040 align:start position:0%
and see how it works if it doesn't work
 
00:46:59.470 --> 00:46:59.480 align:start position:0%
well then we can fix it won't be the
 
00:47:02.069 --> 00:47:02.079 align:start position:0%
first time that we two steps forward one
 
00:47:02.079 --> 00:47:03.230 align:start position:0%
first time that we two steps forward one
step

00:47:03.230 --> 00:47:03.240 align:start position:0%
step
 
00:47:06.510 --> 00:47:06.520 align:start position:0%
backward when I was in the Marine Corps
 
00:47:08.829 --> 00:47:08.839 align:start position:0%
walking the walking my post in the
 
00:47:10.710 --> 00:47:10.720 align:start position:0%
middle of the night with nobody around
 
00:47:13.549 --> 00:47:13.559 align:start position:0%
for Miles sometimes I would do two steps
 
00:47:16.230 --> 00:47:16.240 align:start position:0%
forward one step backward anything to
 
00:47:19.349 --> 00:47:19.359 align:start position:0%
keep just doing it for four more hours
 
00:47:22.750 --> 00:47:22.760 align:start position:0%
so the thing is I I we're we're going to
 
00:47:25.589 --> 00:47:25.599 align:start position:0%
I'm going to support this I'm I'm sure
 
00:47:27.510 --> 00:47:27.520 align:start position:0%
I'm going to antagonize some of my
 
00:47:29.790 --> 00:47:29.800 align:start position:0%
Democratic colleagues because they think
 
00:47:33.630 --> 00:47:33.640 align:start position:0%
we're doing doing the wrong thing but
 
00:47:35.710 --> 00:47:35.720 align:start position:0%
I'm willing to give it a try because I
 
00:47:37.710 --> 00:47:37.720 align:start position:0%
don't think we can just go
 
00:47:39.990 --> 00:47:40.000 align:start position:0%
forward without any
 
00:47:42.710 --> 00:47:42.720 align:start position:0%
changes we don't have the Manpower in
 
00:47:45.630 --> 00:47:45.640 align:start position:0%
many of these small boards and we got to
 
00:47:48.430 --> 00:47:48.440 align:start position:0%
got to supplement that taking away all
 
00:47:51.190 --> 00:47:51.200 align:start position:0%
the administrative stuff all the simple
 
00:47:53.390 --> 00:47:53.400 align:start position:0%
stuff and letting them run their
 
00:47:57.390 --> 00:47:57.400 align:start position:0%
profession let's do that thank you other
 
00:47:59.790 --> 00:47:59.800 align:start position:0%
comments representative Brown uh thank
 
00:48:02.030 --> 00:48:02.040 align:start position:0%
you madam chair uh following up on what
 
00:48:05.630 --> 00:48:05.640 align:start position:0%
representative goalie said here uh I I
 
00:48:06.870 --> 00:48:06.880 align:start position:0%
don't know the answer to this I'm going
 
00:48:08.910 --> 00:48:08.920 align:start position:0%
to throw it out there for
 
00:48:12.069 --> 00:48:12.079 align:start position:0%
discussion uh so there the conversation
 
00:48:14.790 --> 00:48:14.800 align:start position:0%
was as I said some of these boards we
 
00:48:16.430 --> 00:48:16.440 align:start position:0%
went to advisory so that maybe they
 
00:48:19.430 --> 00:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be subject to uh
 
00:48:21.630 --> 00:48:21.640 align:start position:0%
liability as has happened in the rest of
 
00:48:24.910 --> 00:48:24.920 align:start position:0%
the country but why weren't why wasn't
 
00:48:26.950 --> 00:48:26.960 align:start position:0%
that consideration taken for every board
 
00:48:28.750 --> 00:48:28.760 align:start position:0%
or was I don't know if representative
 
00:48:30.630 --> 00:48:30.640 align:start position:0%
leus can follow up on that or anyone
 
00:48:32.990 --> 00:48:33.000 align:start position:0%
else just for discussion purposes
 
00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:34.390 align:start position:0%
else just for discussion purposes
representative

00:48:34.390 --> 00:48:34.400 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:48:37.349 --> 00:48:37.359 align:start position:0%
leus I can't um answer for all the
 
00:48:39.870 --> 00:48:39.880 align:start position:0%
boards I mean uh there was a one on the
 
00:48:42.030 --> 00:48:42.040 align:start position:0%
pediatrist that the chair mentioned but
 
00:48:44.870 --> 00:48:44.880 align:start position:0%
similarly for the land surveyors there
 
00:48:47.950 --> 00:48:47.960 align:start position:0%
was an attempt to merge them with uh
 
00:48:49.270 --> 00:48:49.280 align:start position:0%
Board of engineering which we thought
 
00:48:52.190 --> 00:48:52.200 align:start position:0%
didn't make any sense but um I would
 
00:48:54.829 --> 00:48:54.839 align:start position:0%
suggest uh in the future to have them be
 
00:48:56.270 --> 00:48:56.280 align:start position:0%
in an Advisory Board would would
 
00:48:58.390 --> 00:48:58.400 align:start position:0%
probably be appropriate and and I agree
 
00:48:59.710 --> 00:48:59.720 align:start position:0%
with representative Schmidt I mean there
 
00:49:02.510 --> 00:49:02.520 align:start position:0%
are some advantages not to try and do
 
00:49:04.589 --> 00:49:04.599 align:start position:0%
too large a chunk at one time and then
 
00:49:08.190 --> 00:49:08.200 align:start position:0%
and then you know see what happens thank
 
00:49:11.710 --> 00:49:11.720 align:start position:0%
you I'd like to say that it's very
 
00:49:14.510 --> 00:49:14.520 align:start position:0%
possible that these boards are the ones
 
00:49:17.230 --> 00:49:17.240 align:start position:0%
that had trouble getting enough people
 
00:49:19.750 --> 00:49:19.760 align:start position:0%
appointed to the board they had trouble
 
00:49:21.630 --> 00:49:21.640 align:start position:0%
meeting because they couldn't get a
 
00:49:24.710 --> 00:49:24.720 align:start position:0%
quorum and those were therefore selected
 
00:49:27.230 --> 00:49:27.240 align:start position:0%
for the first round of uh
 
00:49:30.910 --> 00:49:30.920 align:start position:0%
conversion to advisory because that that
 
00:49:34.030 --> 00:49:34.040 align:start position:0%
was a major issue for a number of boards
 
00:49:34.040 --> 00:49:35.910 align:start position:0%
was a major issue for a number of boards
representative

00:49:35.910 --> 00:49:35.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:49:39.230 --> 00:49:39.240 align:start position:0%
sh thank you madam chair I'm I'm
 
00:49:43.069 --> 00:49:43.079 align:start position:0%
listening to all of these points and uh
 
00:49:46.829 --> 00:49:46.839 align:start position:0%
reminded that regarding the guardian ad
 
00:49:50.069 --> 00:49:50.079 align:start position:0%
Liam board which was left in this
 
00:49:52.630 --> 00:49:52.640 align:start position:0%
amendment uh this full committee during
 
00:49:57.109 --> 00:49:57.119 align:start position:0%
the hearing heard from a very esteemed
 
00:49:59.190 --> 00:49:59.200 align:start position:0%
former member of both bodies of the
 
00:50:02.270 --> 00:50:02.280 align:start position:0%
legislature who served on the guardian
 
00:50:05.589 --> 00:50:05.599 align:start position:0%
at lien board that he felt that this was
 
00:50:08.750 --> 00:50:08.760 align:start position:0%
absolutely the wrong thing to do uh with
 
00:50:13.390 --> 00:50:13.400 align:start position:0%
that particular board um and I um I
 
00:50:16.430 --> 00:50:16.440 align:start position:0%
think I agree with most of my colleagues
 
00:50:19.470 --> 00:50:19.480 align:start position:0%
that um I will vote for the amendment
 
00:50:20.990 --> 00:50:21.000 align:start position:0%
because of all the hard work that went
 
00:50:24.950 --> 00:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
into it but I'm sad to see that in it
 
00:50:27.030 --> 00:50:27.040 align:start position:0%
and therefore I will not support the
 
00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:29.870 align:start position:0%
and therefore I will not support the
bill

00:50:29.870 --> 00:50:29.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:33.230 --> 00:50:33.240 align:start position:0%
finally pres goalie thank you madam
 
00:50:35.430 --> 00:50:35.440 align:start position:0%
chair I just want to thank
 
00:50:36.710 --> 00:50:36.720 align:start position:0%
representative Brown for the one of the
 
00:50:38.710 --> 00:50:38.720 align:start position:0%
pieces of paper that we received uh to
 
00:50:41.910 --> 00:50:41.920 align:start position:0%
look at and when I look at when we talk
 
00:50:44.870 --> 00:50:44.880 align:start position:0%
about number of meetings or number of
 
00:50:48.670 --> 00:50:48.680 align:start position:0%
lenses and I look at acupuncture has 190
 
00:50:51.750 --> 00:50:51.760 align:start position:0%
lenses which I think is more than enough
 
00:50:55.630 --> 00:50:55.640 align:start position:0%
to not say that there's a conflict six
 
00:50:55.640 --> 00:50:57.430 align:start position:0%
to not say that there's a conflict six
times

00:50:57.430 --> 00:50:57.440 align:start position:0%
times
 
00:50:59.470 --> 00:50:59.480 align:start position:0%
light them they met three
 
00:51:02.510 --> 00:51:02.520 align:start position:0%
times referee met 12 times this is all
 
00:51:05.510 --> 00:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
during fiscal year 23 that we received
 
00:51:05.520 --> 00:51:06.950 align:start position:0%
during fiscal year 23 that we received
from

00:51:06.950 --> 00:51:06.960 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:51:11.109 --> 00:51:11.119 align:start position:0%
oplc um so I would say they are
 
00:51:13.349 --> 00:51:13.359 align:start position:0%
meeting I would say
 
00:51:16.349 --> 00:51:16.359 align:start position:0%
that there are a few here
 
00:51:19.470 --> 00:51:19.480 align:start position:0%
that have more than enough lenses to say
 
00:51:21.109 --> 00:51:21.119 align:start position:0%
there's not a
 
00:51:25.309 --> 00:51:25.319 align:start position:0%
conflict um so once again for that
 
00:51:27.870 --> 00:51:27.880 align:start position:0%
reason I mean
 
00:51:29.549 --> 00:51:29.559 align:start position:0%
I'll support the amendment but not as
 
00:51:29.559 --> 00:51:32.510 align:start position:0%
I'll support the amendment but not as
amended

00:51:32.510 --> 00:51:32.520 align:start position:0%
amended
 
00:51:35.230 --> 00:51:35.240 align:start position:0%
okay all right on that note the motion
 
00:51:38.950 --> 00:51:38.960 align:start position:0%

is there a second I'll second Madam
chair

01:03:01.750 --> 01:03:01.760 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:03:04.710 --> 01:03:04.720 align:start position:0%
okay you wish to speak to your motion um
 
01:03:06.670 --> 01:03:06.680 align:start position:0%
I think we said most of what needs to be
 
01:03:08.750 --> 01:03:08.760 align:start position:0%
said the only thing
 
01:03:12.230 --> 01:03:12.240 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll say is that um you know I
 
01:03:14.670 --> 01:03:14.680 align:start position:0%
don't see this as a power grab the the
 
01:03:17.510 --> 01:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
right now um oplc we've gave them the
 
01:03:19.870 --> 01:03:19.880 align:start position:0%
authority to do the investigation I mean
 
01:03:21.710 --> 01:03:21.720 align:start position:0%
they don't have expertise in all of the
 
01:03:23.950 --> 01:03:23.960 align:start position:0%
uh professions but they hire people or
 
01:03:27.349 --> 01:03:27.359 align:start position:0%
consult with people to provide that um
 
01:03:28.670 --> 01:03:28.680 align:start position:0%
and they'll be Consulting treating the
 
01:03:30.150 --> 01:03:30.160 align:start position:0%
boards that way Consulting with them on
 
01:03:31.589 --> 01:03:31.599 align:start position:0%
rule making and I think there's
 
01:03:33.230 --> 01:03:33.240 align:start position:0%
mechanisms in place to make sure they
 
01:03:35.670 --> 01:03:35.680 align:start position:0%
don't go run a muck and do something
 
01:03:37.950 --> 01:03:37.960 align:start position:0%
bizarre as I mentioned and the other
 
01:03:39.349 --> 01:03:39.359 align:start position:0%
thing is
 
01:03:42.750 --> 01:03:42.760 align:start position:0%
that um they're kind of the what we
 
01:03:44.510 --> 01:03:44.520 align:start position:0%
heard and other other things I've seen
 
01:03:46.990 --> 01:03:47.000 align:start position:0%
the the way the courts are handling
 
01:03:49.470 --> 01:03:49.480 align:start position:0%
antitrust has changed somewhat and I
 
01:03:50.829 --> 01:03:50.839 align:start position:0%
think there really is you know part of
 
01:03:52.269 --> 01:03:52.279 align:start position:0%
this is risk
 
01:03:54.230 --> 01:03:54.240 align:start position:0%
mitigation partly to the state and
 
01:03:56.029 --> 01:03:56.039 align:start position:0%
partly to the boards I mean the the one
 
01:03:59.109 --> 01:03:59.119 align:start position:0%
down in the um Carolinas there was some
 
01:04:01.349 --> 01:04:01.359 align:start position:0%
uh hundreds of thousands on judgment
 
01:04:03.309 --> 01:04:03.319 align:start position:0%
against uh against the individual
 
01:04:05.670 --> 01:04:05.680 align:start position:0%
members of the board and uh I don't want
 
01:04:07.630 --> 01:04:07.640 align:start position:0%
to see that here and I think there's
 
01:04:09.029 --> 01:04:09.039 align:start position:0%
something you know there's risk of that
 
01:04:11.549 --> 01:04:11.559 align:start position:0%
and I think that risk has grown so
 
01:04:14.789 --> 01:04:14.799 align:start position:0%
that's all I have to say representative
 
01:04:17.190 --> 01:04:17.200 align:start position:0%
Simon uh nothing to add I think we've
 
01:04:19.950 --> 01:04:19.960 align:start position:0%
discussed it at length Okay anyone else
 
01:04:21.470 --> 01:04:21.480 align:start position:0%
have a comment
 
01:04:23.430 --> 01:04:23.440 align:start position:0%
question all right in that case the
 
01:04:25.269 --> 01:04:25.279 align:start position:0%
motion is ought to pass with Amendment
 
01:04:28.109 --> 01:04:28.119 align:start position:0%

gold any
 
01:05:44.789 --> 01:05:44.799 align:start position:0%
discussion sure um I'd like I I do think
 
01:05:46.309 --> 01:05:46.319 align:start position:0%
that we should look at this I think it's
 
01:05:48.309 --> 01:05:48.319 align:start position:0%
an important
 
01:05:48.319 --> 01:05:49.910 align:start position:0%
an important
um

01:05:49.910 --> 01:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:53.430 --> 01:05:53.440 align:start position:0%
evaluation and I'd like this do an inim
 
01:05:56.670 --> 01:05:56.680 align:start position:0%
study with the other Bill to to discuss
 
01:06:00.109 --> 01:06:00.119 align:start position:0%
with the oplc oversight committee as to
 
01:06:03.230 --> 01:06:03.240 align:start position:0%
what we can do Al together including the
 
01:06:05.870 --> 01:06:05.880 align:start position:0%
boards and including the office of of a
 
01:06:07.829 --> 01:06:07.839 align:start position:0%
liur and certification so I think it
 
01:06:10.150 --> 01:06:10.160 align:start position:0%
should be a group effort and I'm hoping
 
01:06:12.269 --> 01:06:12.279 align:start position:0%
that the committee will see this as a
 
01:06:17.150 --> 01:06:17.160 align:start position:0%
good faith measure to get this done in a
 
01:06:20.309 --> 01:06:20.319 align:start position:0%
more amicable way thank you
 
01:06:22.390 --> 01:06:22.400 align:start position:0%
representative gold thank you madam
 
01:06:26.950 --> 01:06:26.960 align:start position:0%
chair yes I um
 
01:06:29.549 --> 01:06:29.559 align:start position:0%
I was very happy to hear the commitment
 
01:06:31.510 --> 01:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
that this will be an interim study this
 
01:06:34.470 --> 01:06:34.480 align:start position:0%
is not a a polite way to make this all
 
01:06:38.109 --> 01:06:38.119 align:start position:0%
go away and that my colleagues are
 
01:06:41.789 --> 01:06:41.799 align:start position:0%
committed to making it happen and and
 
01:06:45.630 --> 01:06:45.640 align:start position:0%
working with those um those people who
 
01:06:47.750 --> 01:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
are opposed to anything left in this
 
01:06:50.789 --> 01:06:50.799 align:start position:0%
bill and and giving it the time it needs
 
01:06:52.470 --> 01:06:52.480 align:start position:0%
so that we come out of this with a good
 
01:06:54.589 --> 01:06:54.599 align:start position:0%
situation because we do support the work
 
01:06:56.510 --> 01:06:56.520 align:start position:0%
that went into it
 
01:06:59.150 --> 01:06:59.160 align:start position:0%
anyone else representative
 
01:07:01.549 --> 01:07:01.559 align:start position:0%
Schmid thank you madam
 
01:07:04.789 --> 01:07:04.799 align:start position:0%
chair well as I said
 
01:07:07.309 --> 01:07:07.319 align:start position:0%
before I've been on this committee for
 
01:07:07.319 --> 01:07:08.549 align:start position:0%
before I've been on this committee for
18

01:07:08.549 --> 01:07:08.559 align:start position:0%
18
 
01:07:11.230 --> 01:07:11.240 align:start position:0%
years okay I've been on the Jael car for
 
01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:12.430 align:start position:0%
years okay I've been on the Jael car for
18

01:07:12.430 --> 01:07:12.440 align:start position:0%
18
 
01:07:15.670 --> 01:07:15.680 align:start position:0%
years I've seen committees that work
 
01:07:18.349 --> 01:07:18.359 align:start position:0%
hard that care about one another as well
 
01:07:19.950 --> 01:07:19.960 align:start position:0%
as about the work they're
 
01:07:23.309 --> 01:07:23.319 align:start position:0%
doing uh and I'm I'm persuaded that
 
01:07:26.190 --> 01:07:26.200 align:start position:0%
there there are aspects of of this
 
01:07:28.910 --> 01:07:28.920 align:start position:0%
situation that we have not explored
 
01:07:31.750 --> 01:07:31.760 align:start position:0%
enough and I don't want to dive off the
 
01:07:33.750 --> 01:07:33.760 align:start position:0%
diving board and have this go to the
 
01:07:36.309 --> 01:07:36.319 align:start position:0%
house where it'll just be a partisan
 
01:07:39.589 --> 01:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
situation I have a lot of respect for
 
01:07:41.670 --> 01:07:41.680 align:start position:0%
the conversation we've had where we have
 
01:07:44.510 --> 01:07:44.520 align:start position:0%
really worked and it where we're not
 
01:07:46.710 --> 01:07:46.720 align:start position:0%
bashing one another's politics or
 
01:07:50.470 --> 01:07:50.480 align:start position:0%
whatever uh and and and I I I think
 
01:07:54.789 --> 01:07:54.799 align:start position:0%
there's there's too much Merit to the
 
01:07:54.799 --> 01:07:56.549 align:start position:0%
there's there's too much Merit to the
continued

01:07:56.549 --> 01:07:56.559 align:start position:0%
continued
 
01:08:01.069 --> 01:08:01.079 align:start position:0%
cooperation uh to to turn it into a
 
01:08:04.549 --> 01:08:04.559 align:start position:0%
straight um vote in the house and God
 
01:08:06.190 --> 01:08:06.200 align:start position:0%
knows what will happen in the Senate and
 
01:08:08.670 --> 01:08:08.680 align:start position:0%
so forth so I think interim study where
 
01:08:12.230 --> 01:08:12.240 align:start position:0%
we can really get at this uh is the way
 
01:08:16.189 --> 01:08:16.199 align:start position:0%
to go so I'm going to vote for in study
 
01:08:18.829 --> 01:08:18.839 align:start position:0%
anyone else representative laus so I
 
01:08:20.749 --> 01:08:20.759 align:start position:0%
appreciate the comments I don't see this
 
01:08:23.430 --> 01:08:23.440 align:start position:0%
as a political issue I'm going to oppose
 
01:08:26.470 --> 01:08:26.480 align:start position:0%
an N study and we'll see what happens um
 
01:08:30.309 --> 01:08:30.319 align:start position:0%
um you know if it were to pass the house
 
01:08:31.550 --> 01:08:31.560 align:start position:0%
and if there are things that need to
 
01:08:33.630 --> 01:08:33.640 align:start position:0%
come out of it I mean you could make
 
01:08:35.030 --> 01:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
that argument to the Senate they might
 
01:08:38.390 --> 01:08:38.400 align:start position:0%
very well go along with it um but the
 
01:08:40.189 --> 01:08:40.199 align:start position:0%
thing bottom line is I think it is the
 
01:08:43.870 --> 01:08:43.880 align:start position:0%
right way to go and and that's my view
 
01:08:47.870 --> 01:08:47.880 align:start position:0%
okay anyone else representative Brown uh
 
01:08:49.189 --> 01:08:49.199 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair for for my

1226 no no this is a revised Amendment
 
01:12:04.189 --> 01:12:04.199 align:start position:0%
1254 which is hot off the press and it
 
01:12:07.110 --> 01:12:07.120 align:start position:0%
should be making its way around oh okay
 
01:12:10.470 --> 01:12:10.480 align:start position:0%
there may be two you may have to uh I
 
01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:11.550 align:start position:0%
there may be two you may have to uh I
divided

01:12:11.550 --> 01:12:11.560 align:start position:0%
divided
 
01:12:14.189 --> 01:12:14.199 align:start position:0%
it so this
 
01:12:14.199 --> 01:12:16.510 align:start position:0%
it so this
amendment

01:12:16.510 --> 01:12:16.520 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:12:20.430 --> 01:12:20.440 align:start position:0%
does a couple of things first it takes
 
01:12:24.510 --> 01:12:24.520 align:start position:0%
the definitions of AI and makes them
 
01:12:27.270 --> 01:12:27.280 align:start position:0%
exactly the the same as in other bills
 
01:12:29.950 --> 01:12:29.960 align:start position:0%
that we've got this year there's one in
 
01:12:31.590 --> 01:12:31.600 align:start position:0%
criminal justice there's one in
 
01:12:33.470 --> 01:12:33.480 align:start position:0%
judiciary and there's one in election
 
01:12:37.229 --> 01:12:37.239 align:start position:0%
law so we have made sure that the
 
01:12:39.350 --> 01:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
definition is the
 
01:12:43.430 --> 01:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
same okay on under the
 
01:12:47.110 --> 01:12:47.120 align:start position:0%
prohibitions it eliminates a couple of
 
01:12:47.120 --> 01:12:48.070 align:start position:0%
prohibitions it eliminates a couple of
the

01:12:48.070 --> 01:12:48.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:12:51.270 --> 01:12:51.280 align:start position:0%
prohibitions that were flagged uh one at
 
01:12:53.790 --> 01:12:53.800 align:start position:0%
the hearing one at another meeting I was
 
01:12:57.790 --> 01:12:57.800 align:start position:0%
at as might be problematic because we
 
01:13:00.030 --> 01:13:00.040 align:start position:0%
don't have the time to really deal with
 
01:13:04.229 --> 01:13:04.239 align:start position:0%
them um that's the prohibition on uh uh
 
01:13:06.229 --> 01:13:06.239 align:start position:0%
counseling I think it
 
01:13:08.350 --> 01:13:08.360 align:start position:0%
was cognitive
 
01:13:12.149 --> 01:13:12.159 align:start position:0%
behavior changes and
 
01:13:15.350 --> 01:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
um look at the original bill
 
01:13:19.270 --> 01:13:19.280 align:start position:0%
on right right that that was considered
 
01:13:21.149 --> 01:13:21.159 align:start position:0%
problematic by some people at the
 
01:13:21.159 --> 01:13:23.669 align:start position:0%
problematic by some people at the
hearing

01:13:23.669 --> 01:13:23.679 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
01:13:26.629 --> 01:13:26.639 align:start position:0%
and I didn't want to include
 
01:13:29.629 --> 01:13:29.639 align:start position:0%
problematical issues the other was the
 
01:13:31.709 --> 01:13:31.719 align:start position:0%
disparate impact
 
01:13:36.270 --> 01:13:36.280 align:start position:0%
which uh several people at the meeting
 
01:13:37.990 --> 01:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
where we talked about the definition
 
01:13:39.750 --> 01:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
said that might be an
 
01:13:45.350 --> 01:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
issue so we said fine we'll we'll just
 
01:13:48.669 --> 01:13:48.679 align:start position:0%
identify prohibit
 
01:13:51.870 --> 01:13:51.880 align:start position:0%
unlawful classifying persons to result
 
01:13:54.030 --> 01:13:54.040 align:start position:0%
in unlawful
 
01:13:56.790 --> 01:13:56.800 align:start position:0%
discrimination real uh biometric
 
01:13:59.430 --> 01:13:59.440 align:start position:0%
identification systems for
 
01:14:04.430 --> 01:14:04.440 align:start position:0%
surveillance um facial recognition voice
 
01:14:07.510 --> 01:14:07.520 align:start position:0%
recognition except with a
 
01:14:11.510 --> 01:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
warrant and deep fakes for any deceptive
 
01:14:14.110 --> 01:14:14.120 align:start position:0%
purpose which seems
 
01:14:19.950 --> 01:14:19.960 align:start position:0%
fine um then it uh goes on to say that
 
01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:21.629 align:start position:0%
fine um then it uh goes on to say that
the

01:14:21.629 --> 01:14:21.639 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:14:25.310 --> 01:14:25.320 align:start position:0%
agency use of AI must comply with with
 
01:14:29.470 --> 01:14:29.480 align:start position:0%
this chapter and the doit code of
 
01:14:32.790 --> 01:14:32.800 align:start position:0%
ethics that is available it's on their
 
01:14:35.310 --> 01:14:35.320 align:start position:0%
website it's on the fact it's on the top
 
01:14:38.390 --> 01:14:38.400 align:start position:0%
of their their website and it covers a
 
01:14:42.070 --> 01:14:42.080 align:start position:0%
lot of uh points in more detail than
 
01:14:43.270 --> 01:14:43.280 align:start position:0%
should be in
 
01:14:46.390 --> 01:14:46.400 align:start position:0%
statute so
 
01:14:49.950 --> 01:14:49.960 align:start position:0%
um that's now complying with that is a
 
01:14:53.229 --> 01:14:53.239 align:start position:0%
requirement and then it requires doit to
 
01:14:56.470 --> 01:14:56.480 align:start position:0%
one-time report on these
 
01:14:58.629 --> 01:14:58.639 align:start position:0%
systems the
 
01:15:01.990 --> 01:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
uh uh Professor Corman who worked with
 
01:15:04.629 --> 01:15:04.639 align:start position:0%
us on this amendment put also added the
 
01:15:06.830 --> 01:15:06.840 align:start position:0%
severability clause which I don't think
 
01:15:10.110 --> 01:15:10.120 align:start position:0%
is necessary but it can't
 
01:15:14.669 --> 01:15:14.679 align:start position:0%
hurt so and this is an amendment from
 
01:15:16.870 --> 01:15:16.880 align:start position:0%
myself representative groto who worked
 
01:15:19.070 --> 01:15:19.080 align:start position:0%
with the subcommittee on it and
 
01:15:21.189 --> 01:15:21.199 align:start position:0%
representative Corman who is the author
 
01:15:24.310 --> 01:15:24.320 align:start position:0%
of the bill it is also not opposed by
 
01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:26.229 align:start position:0%
of the bill it is also not opposed by
DOI

01:15:26.229 --> 01:15:26.239 align:start position:0%
DOI
 
01:15:32.149 --> 01:15:32.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:36.550 --> 01:15:36.560 align:start position:0%
um it it simplifies the bill a little it
 
01:15:39.310 --> 01:15:39.320 align:start position:0%
makes it the definitions
 
01:15:44.270 --> 01:15:44.280 align:start position:0%
identical and puts the U ethics
 
01:15:47.030 --> 01:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
requirements um into into
 
01:15:49.709 --> 01:15:49.719 align:start position:0%
law representative
 
01:15:51.870 --> 01:15:51.880 align:start position:0%
Bara thank you madam chair I have
 
01:15:55.030 --> 01:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
nothing to add okay question represent
 
01:15:56.750 --> 01:15:56.760 align:start position:0%
BL us yep I was just wondering if you
 
01:15:58.470 --> 01:15:58.480 align:start position:0%
were someone could say a little more
 
01:16:00.550 --> 01:16:00.560 align:start position:0%
about what the concerns around cognitive
 
01:16:03.310 --> 01:16:03.320 align:start position:0%
behavioral manipulation was just uh
 
01:16:05.070 --> 01:16:05.080 align:start position:0%
because it's used for counseling in some
 
01:16:07.110 --> 01:16:07.120 align:start position:0%
cases the suicide
 
01:16:09.390 --> 01:16:09.400 align:start position:0%
hotline okay they're trying to convince
 
01:16:13.189 --> 01:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
people not to uh uh commit
 
01:16:16.430 --> 01:16:16.440 align:start position:0%
suicide so rather than give them an
 
01:16:18.430 --> 01:16:18.440 align:start position:0%
exception or try and figure out how to
 
01:16:21.790 --> 01:16:21.800 align:start position:0%
phrase it that we just say that's that's
 
01:16:26.870 --> 01:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
too complicated for today okay
 
01:16:30.669 --> 01:16:30.679 align:start position:0%
so and I believe okay anyone else
 
01:16:33.189 --> 01:16:33.199 align:start position:0%
questions comments
 
01:16:37.390 --> 01:16:37.400 align:start position:0%
representative thank you madam chair so
 
01:16:42.709 --> 01:16:42.719 align:start position:0%
uh this is you know coming up like
 
01:16:42.719 --> 01:16:44.310 align:start position:0%
uh this is you know coming up like
uh

01:16:44.310 --> 01:16:44.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:16:46.110 --> 01:16:46.120 align:start position:0%
um like
 
01:16:51.510 --> 01:16:51.520 align:start position:0%
a ballistic missile fired from someplace
 
01:16:56.470 --> 01:16:56.480 align:start position:0%
that's portending Doom but uh
 
01:17:00.510 --> 01:17:00.520 align:start position:0%
uh I I'm pleased to see that uh sponsors
 
01:17:04.070 --> 01:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
are um people I respect and bipartisan
 
01:17:07.030 --> 01:17:07.040 align:start position:0%
and so forth because I certainly think
 
01:17:09.790 --> 01:17:09.800 align:start position:0%
that this is an issue that is becoming
 
01:17:16.149 --> 01:17:16.159 align:start position:0%
more and more uh um more scary uh and
 
01:17:19.470 --> 01:17:19.480 align:start position:0%
threatening than uh than I I thought it
 
01:17:23.750 --> 01:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
was at the very beginning um and and I
 
01:17:26.669 --> 01:17:26.679 align:start position:0%
think it's it's it's it's going to
 
01:17:32.149 --> 01:17:32.159 align:start position:0%
be very much worse very fast so I'm I'll
 
01:17:32.159 --> 01:17:33.149 align:start position:0%
be very much worse very fast so I'm I'll
support

01:17:33.149 --> 01:17:33.159 align:start position:0%
support
 
01:17:36.790 --> 01:17:36.800 align:start position:0%
this represent R py thank you madam
 
01:17:39.629 --> 01:17:39.639 align:start position:0%
chair um I think that this is a step in
 
01:17:42.149 --> 01:17:42.159 align:start position:0%
the right direction whether we like it
 
01:17:46.470 --> 01:17:46.480 align:start position:0%
or not it's here and it's going to be
 
01:17:49.750 --> 01:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
part of our lives and to take a
 
01:17:52.189 --> 01:17:52.199 align:start position:0%
proactive step in the right direction
 
01:17:55.470 --> 01:17:55.480 align:start position:0%
and not be um
 
01:17:58.830 --> 01:17:58.840 align:start position:0%
respon reactive and knee-jerk reaction
 
01:18:01.110 --> 01:18:01.120 align:start position:0%
to say how we have to do it we have to
 
01:18:03.189 --> 01:18:03.199 align:start position:0%
do something because it's here at our
 
01:18:08.030 --> 01:18:08.040 align:start position:0%
doorstep and I think it is really um was
 
01:18:10.790 --> 01:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
I had the opportunity to sit through the
 
01:18:12.750 --> 01:18:12.760 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and
 
01:18:16.189 --> 01:18:16.199 align:start position:0%
that problem solving came through and
 
01:18:20.390 --> 01:18:20.400 align:start position:0%
this is really a good move and I commend
 
01:18:22.830 --> 01:18:22.840 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee for coming together
 
01:18:25.830 --> 01:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
with the very appropriate
 
01:18:28.149 --> 01:18:28.159 align:start position:0%

motion uh yes thank you madam chair
 
01:21:39.030 --> 01:21:39.040 align:start position:0%
after our discussion last time um I did
 
01:21:41.510 --> 01:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
some work on this um taking some of the
 
01:21:42.830 --> 01:21:42.840 align:start position:0%
language out of
 
01:21:45.629 --> 01:21:45.639 align:start position:0%
1521 um placing it into amendment to uh
 
01:21:47.310 --> 01:21:47.320 align:start position:0%
be added to
 
01:21:51.790 --> 01:21:51.800 align:start position:0%
1622 um lines 4 through 12 deal with uh
 
01:21:53.830 --> 01:21:53.840 align:start position:0%
much of the material that was in
 
01:21:53.840 --> 01:21:55.550 align:start position:0%
much of the material that was in
paragraph

01:21:55.550 --> 01:21:55.560 align:start position:0%
paragraph
 
01:21:58.030 --> 01:21:58.040 align:start position:0%
um making sure that public comment um is
 
01:21:59.950 --> 01:21:59.960 align:start position:0%
posted when it's received
 
01:22:04.709 --> 01:22:04.719 align:start position:0%
electronically um and then also uh as
 
01:22:06.790 --> 01:22:06.800 align:start position:0%
resources would allow uh anything
 
01:22:08.790 --> 01:22:08.800 align:start position:0%
submitted by regular mail would also be
 
01:22:11.470 --> 01:22:11.480 align:start position:0%
scanned and added um to the web page for
 
01:22:13.149 --> 01:22:13.159 align:start position:0%
electronic documents it does require
 
01:22:16.270 --> 01:22:16.280 align:start position:0%
that each rule has its own specific page
 
01:22:18.110 --> 01:22:18.120 align:start position:0%
uh where those comments would be would
 
01:22:21.229 --> 01:22:21.239 align:start position:0%
be posted so that's the um so that the
 
01:22:23.030 --> 01:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
public can find it easier that's the
 
01:22:24.830 --> 01:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
gist of the first section there and then
 
01:22:30.590 --> 01:22:30.600 align:start position:0%
13- 17 um this section here um it's
 
01:22:34.790 --> 01:22:34.800 align:start position:0%
actually already in statute RSA 541
 
01:22:38.470 --> 01:22:38.480 align:start position:0%
a12e um the concept is anyway we're just
 
01:22:38.480 --> 01:22:39.390 align:start position:0%
a12e um the concept is anyway we're just
kind

01:22:39.390 --> 01:22:39.400 align:start position:0%
kind
 
01:22:42.550 --> 01:22:42.560 align:start position:0%
of um giving greater detail kind of
 
01:22:44.629 --> 01:22:44.639 align:start position:0%
expanding on it a little bit um so it
 
01:22:46.350 --> 01:22:46.360 align:start position:0%
presently reads a report of the public
 
01:22:48.070 --> 01:22:48.080 align:start position:0%
comment shall uh received on the rule
 
01:22:49.990 --> 01:22:50.000 align:start position:0%
shall be created the report shall
 
01:22:51.189 --> 01:22:51.199 align:start position:0%
indicate how the comment was
 
01:22:53.270 --> 01:22:53.280 align:start position:0%
incorporated into the final rule if the
 
01:22:54.709 --> 01:22:54.719 align:start position:0%
comment was not incorporated into to the
 
01:22:56.350 --> 01:22:56.360 align:start position:0%
final rule a substantive explanation of
 
01:22:58.390 --> 01:22:58.400 align:start position:0%
the adopting Authority overrall relevant
 
01:23:00.110 --> 01:23:00.120 align:start position:0%
arguments and considerations made in the
 
01:23:02.070 --> 01:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
comment shall be included so just
 
01:23:03.750 --> 01:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
basically saying if you didn't take the
 
01:23:05.590 --> 01:23:05.600 align:start position:0%
rule uh you didn't take the comment into
 
01:23:07.430 --> 01:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
the rule why didn't you take the comment
 
01:23:08.950 --> 01:23:08.960 align:start position:0%
into the rule and having to give some
 
01:23:11.270 --> 01:23:11.280 align:start position:0%
sort of uh substantive explanation for
 
01:23:14.470 --> 01:23:14.480 align:start position:0%
that so that's the gist of the amendment
 
01:23:20.070 --> 01:23:20.080 align:start position:0%
okay and Al this is the a large part of
 
01:23:21.510 --> 01:23:21.520 align:start position:0%
what was in
 
01:23:26.910 --> 01:23:26.920 align:start position:0%
1521 other than the problematic delays
 
01:23:30.189 --> 01:23:30.199 align:start position:0%
and um time phasing that would would
 
01:23:32.790 --> 01:23:32.800 align:start position:0%
have required the total rewrite of the
 
01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:35.790 align:start position:0%
have required the total rewrite of the
uh

01:23:35.790 --> 01:23:35.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:23:39.629 --> 01:23:39.639 align:start position:0%
uh of the of the entire rul making
 
01:23:44.510 --> 01:23:44.520 align:start position:0%
process but these um and this expands on
 
01:23:46.950 --> 01:23:46.960 align:start position:0%
the the how the public comments are
 
01:23:50.270 --> 01:23:50.280 align:start position:0%
reported to we already require a report
 
01:23:53.790 --> 01:23:53.800 align:start position:0%
that is was newly in newly effective
 
01:23:55.990 --> 01:23:56.000 align:start position:0%
this past October so we haven't seen a
 
01:24:00.550 --> 01:24:00.560 align:start position:0%
lot of them but this will expand how the
 
01:24:03.110 --> 01:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
agency responds to comments and that was
 
01:24:04.990 --> 01:24:05.000 align:start position:0%
a big part of the concerns that
 
01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:06.390 align:start position:0%
a big part of the concerns that
generated

01:24:06.390 --> 01:24:06.400 align:start position:0%
generated
 
01:24:09.550 --> 01:24:09.560 align:start position:0%
1521 representative leus um thank you
 
01:24:10.709 --> 01:24:10.719 align:start position:0%
that's just to make sure I understand
 
01:24:13.629 --> 01:24:13.639 align:start position:0%
what we're doing here um am I correct
 
01:24:16.110 --> 01:24:16.120 align:start position:0%
that this amendment just adds to 1622
 
01:24:17.950 --> 01:24:17.960 align:start position:0%
and does not change anything already
 
01:24:20.430 --> 01:24:20.440 align:start position:0%
there that's the first part and second
 
01:24:23.070 --> 01:24:23.080 align:start position:0%
is um forget exactly what we did in the
 
01:24:26.270 --> 01:24:26.280 align:start position:0%
last exact session of the bill but um is
 
01:24:28.229 --> 01:24:28.239 align:start position:0%
anything that we might have done there
 
01:24:31.629 --> 01:24:31.639 align:start position:0%
included in what we're in the bill or no
 
01:24:35.110 --> 01:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
this this bill adds the the new
 
01:24:38.629 --> 01:24:38.639 align:start position:0%
paragraph Y and then it amends another
 
01:24:42.149 --> 01:24:42.159 align:start position:0%
section of 541a that was not included in
 
01:24:45.070 --> 01:24:45.080 align:start position:0%
1622 okay all right so it'll be the bill
 
01:24:47.189 --> 01:24:47.199 align:start position:0%
as introduced plus the amendment plus
 
01:24:48.910 --> 01:24:48.920 align:start position:0%
the amendment we did last time okay
 
01:24:50.430 --> 01:24:50.440 align:start position:0%
that's what I trying to all right that's
 
01:24:52.790 --> 01:24:52.800 align:start position:0%
what I was asking about we adopt this
 
01:24:54.950 --> 01:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
amendment we will
 
01:24:57.229 --> 01:24:57.239 align:start position:0%
our uh our researcher will have to make
 
01:24:58.950 --> 01:24:58.960 align:start position:0%
sure we get a single amendment that
 
01:25:01.430 --> 01:25:01.440 align:start position:0%
includes both of them okay thank you
 
01:25:03.709 --> 01:25:03.719 align:start position:0%
okay representative Schmid thank you
 
01:25:06.070 --> 01:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
madam chair uh
 
01:25:08.669 --> 01:25:08.679 align:start position:0%
so just as a general comment I'm very
 
01:25:10.510 --> 01:25:10.520 align:start position:0%
supportive because I think this is step
 
01:25:12.990 --> 01:25:13.000 align:start position:0%
in the right direction uh but my
 
01:25:16.910 --> 01:25:16.920 align:start position:0%
question is um line
 
01:25:21.070 --> 01:25:21.080 align:start position:0%
16 the language um it becomes somewhat
 
01:25:23.070 --> 01:25:23.080 align:start position:0%
opaque in terms of what is actually
 
01:25:25.470 --> 01:25:25.480 align:start position:0%
intended by by the
 
01:25:28.470 --> 01:25:28.480 align:start position:0%
phrase explanation of the adopting
 
01:25:31.669 --> 01:25:31.679 align:start position:0%
Authority overrule relevant
 
01:25:35.629 --> 01:25:35.639 align:start position:0%
arguments um because I'm not sure I
 
01:25:41.109 --> 01:25:41.119 align:start position:0%
understand that um uh as a former German
 
01:25:44.629 --> 01:25:44.639 align:start position:0%
Professor I look at and say directly
 
01:25:47.990 --> 01:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
translated from the German I think uh
 
01:25:49.950 --> 01:25:49.960 align:start position:0%
because it seems like a
 
01:25:52.950 --> 01:25:52.960 align:start position:0%
long representative Simon do you wish to
 
01:25:55.510 --> 01:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
explain the uh thank you madam chair uh
 
01:25:56.870 --> 01:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
first I would say that's not how I wrote
 
01:25:59.750 --> 01:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
it um and I get it at about 10:15 right
 
01:26:00.950 --> 01:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
before the meeting started so I didn't
 
01:26:02.870 --> 01:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
have time to R but I think I understand
 
01:26:05.030 --> 01:26:05.040 align:start position:0%
what they're saying um they have to give
 
01:26:07.350 --> 01:26:07.360 align:start position:0%
a substantive explanation the adopting
 
01:26:09.550 --> 01:26:09.560 align:start position:0%
Authority would be the the group who's
 
01:26:13.470 --> 01:26:13.480 align:start position:0%
writing got that that part was um so
 
01:26:16.070 --> 01:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
they overrule to the relevant arguments
 
01:26:17.149 --> 01:26:17.159 align:start position:0%
there should be another word in there
 
01:26:19.629 --> 01:26:19.639 align:start position:0%
probably to the relevant arguments and
 
01:26:21.030 --> 01:26:21.040 align:start position:0%
considerations made in the comment
 
01:26:22.590 --> 01:26:22.600 align:start position:0%
section but I think we can probably get
 
01:26:26.350 --> 01:26:26.360 align:start position:0%
that polished up after I I just we we
 
01:26:28.149 --> 01:26:28.159 align:start position:0%
want to understand what we're saying
 
01:26:29.590 --> 01:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
there because it certainly is not a
 
01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:30.550 align:start position:0%
there because it certainly is not a
common

01:26:30.550 --> 01:26:30.560 align:start position:0%
common
 
01:26:35.350 --> 01:26:35.360 align:start position:0%
construction uh and uh so let yes if I'm
 
01:26:37.669 --> 01:26:37.679 align:start position:0%
not misten could we say when we're
 
01:26:39.830 --> 01:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
getting the SEC the final amendment that
 
01:26:41.550 --> 01:26:41.560 align:start position:0%
instead of
 
01:26:45.109 --> 01:26:45.119 align:start position:0%
overrule we should say decision to
 
01:26:48.109 --> 01:26:48.119 align:start position:0%
overrule that's what was there before
 
01:26:50.229 --> 01:26:50.239 align:start position:0%
they they changed the language to this I
 
01:26:52.149 --> 01:26:52.159 align:start position:0%
think decision to overrule makes much
 
01:26:52.159 --> 01:26:53.229 align:start position:0%
think decision to overrule makes much
more

01:26:53.229 --> 01:26:53.239 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:26:53.239 --> 01:26:55.390 align:start position:0%
more
sense

01:26:55.390 --> 01:26:55.400 align:start position:0%
sense
 
01:26:56.990 --> 01:26:57.000 align:start position:0%
representative Brown you have a comment
 
01:26:58.750 --> 01:26:58.760 align:start position:0%
well actually I do understand it is
 
01:27:01.709 --> 01:27:01.719 align:start position:0%
written there you go
 
01:27:05.030 --> 01:27:05.040 align:start position:0%
so overrule relevant arguments is a
 
01:27:08.590 --> 01:27:08.600 align:start position:0%
single noun right that's
 
01:27:11.750 --> 01:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
an adopting the our Authority or
 
01:27:13.629 --> 01:27:13.639 align:start position:0%
authority you could change
 
01:27:19.189 --> 01:27:19.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:22.550 --> 01:27:22.560 align:start position:0%
uh you almost killed him
 
01:27:24.990 --> 01:27:25.000 align:start position:0%
Carol it's an effect they have on people
 
01:27:27.790 --> 01:27:27.800 align:start position:0%
apparently well I have to admit that
 
01:27:29.950 --> 01:27:29.960 align:start position:0%
isn't something that the naive reader
 
01:27:34.229 --> 01:27:34.239 align:start position:0%
would immediately accept so uh I think
 
01:27:34.239 --> 01:27:39.109 align:start position:0%
would immediately accept so uh I think
we

01:27:39.109 --> 01:27:39.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:42.910 --> 01:27:42.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:45.070 --> 01:27:45.080 align:start position:0%
right that's that's something I can fix
 
01:27:47.350 --> 01:27:47.360 align:start position:0%
after a vote on it though correct okay I
 
01:27:49.910 --> 01:27:49.920 align:start position:0%
if it doesn't change the substance right
 
01:27:51.310 --> 01:27:51.320 align:start position:0%
I think so since we're going to need
 
01:28:00.470 --> 01:28:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:03.750 --> 01:28:03.760 align:start position:0%
M yes representative PL I'm reading this
 
01:28:06.030 --> 01:28:06.040 align:start position:0%
and if this if it struck out adopting
 
01:28:07.990 --> 01:28:08.000 align:start position:0%
Authority overrule and just said
 
01:28:09.870 --> 01:28:09.880 align:start position:0%
incorporate in the final rule of subst
 
01:28:11.390 --> 01:28:11.400 align:start position:0%
explanation of the relevant arguments
 
01:28:13.350 --> 01:28:13.360 align:start position:0%
and considerations made in the comment
 
01:28:14.790 --> 01:28:14.800 align:start position:0%
shall be
 
01:28:17.830 --> 01:28:17.840 align:start position:0%
included that makes makes sense because
 
01:28:20.910 --> 01:28:20.920 align:start position:0%
of the my English at work and I didn't
 
01:28:22.750 --> 01:28:22.760 align:start position:0%
take German I took
 
01:28:25.669 --> 01:28:25.679 align:start position:0%
French of the relevant arguments and
 
01:28:27.990 --> 01:28:28.000 align:start position:0%
considerations made in the yeah that
 
01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:29.550 align:start position:0%
considerations made in the yeah that
that

01:28:29.550 --> 01:28:29.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:28:33.350 --> 01:28:33.360 align:start position:0%
makes excellent I think we will uh
 
01:28:37.310 --> 01:28:37.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:39.830 --> 01:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
approval yes
 
01:28:42.350 --> 01:28:42.360 align:start position:0%
our no I mean because that's what they
 
01:28:45.950 --> 01:28:45.960 align:start position:0%
want they want the com the a substantive
 
01:28:48.550 --> 01:28:48.560 align:start position:0%
explanation of the relevant arguments
 
01:28:50.390 --> 01:28:50.400 align:start position:0%
and considerations
 
01:28:52.390 --> 01:28:52.400 align:start position:0%
okay is that agreeable to you
 
01:28:54.270 --> 01:28:54.280 align:start position:0%
representative Simon um I think that I
 
01:28:55.629 --> 01:28:55.639 align:start position:0%
think that the
 
01:28:58.590 --> 01:28:58.600 align:start position:0%
overrule part of it is important I'm not
 
01:28:59.709 --> 01:28:59.719 align:start position:0%
sure if he said that that was in there
 
01:29:03.189 --> 01:29:03.199 align:start position:0%
or not explanation of the of overruling
 
01:29:06.189 --> 01:29:06.199 align:start position:0%
Rel of the authorities I don't know I
 
01:29:07.790 --> 01:29:07.800 align:start position:0%
think the overrule was part of the point
 
01:29:09.790 --> 01:29:09.800 align:start position:0%
if we leave that word out I think that
 
01:29:11.910 --> 01:29:11.920 align:start position:0%
um because that's the that's the bigger
 
01:29:13.550 --> 01:29:13.560 align:start position:0%
concern the bigger concern is when they
 
01:29:17.070 --> 01:29:17.080 align:start position:0%
don't incorporate the comment why didn't
 
01:29:18.350 --> 01:29:18.360 align:start position:0%
they incorporate the comment that would
 
01:29:21.510 --> 01:29:21.520 align:start position:0%
be the overrule on it so all right
 
01:29:23.669 --> 01:29:23.679 align:start position:0%
represent Madam chair I think it's clear
 
01:29:25.830 --> 01:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
to begin with because if the if comment
 
01:29:27.950 --> 01:29:27.960 align:start position:0%
was not
 
01:29:29.830 --> 01:29:29.840 align:start position:0%
Incorporated that that just says it
 
01:29:31.430 --> 01:29:31.440 align:start position:0%
right there if the comment was not
 
01:29:34.229 --> 01:29:34.239 align:start position:0%
incorporated then a substance in the
 
01:29:36.629 --> 01:29:36.639 align:start position:0%
final rule subst explanation relevant of
 
01:29:39.709 --> 01:29:39.719 align:start position:0%
relevant arguments and considerations
 
01:29:42.350 --> 01:29:42.360 align:start position:0%
made in the comment shall be included
 
01:29:44.470 --> 01:29:44.480 align:start position:0%
because so the whole point the whole
 
01:29:47.470 --> 01:29:47.480 align:start position:0%
point it wasn't adopted therefore right
 
01:29:51.550 --> 01:29:51.560 align:start position:0%
yeah right and having seen some of these
 
01:29:54.709 --> 01:29:54.719 align:start position:0%
um against the adoption well well I mean
 
01:29:57.830 --> 01:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
the the in some cases they say you know
 
01:29:59.229 --> 01:29:59.239 align:start position:0%
yes we agree with this comment we've
 
01:30:01.669 --> 01:30:01.679 align:start position:0%
included it in the rule which is easy
 
01:30:04.109 --> 01:30:04.119 align:start position:0%
but they need to put substantive
 
01:30:06.550 --> 01:30:06.560 align:start position:0%
explanations of when they are
 
01:30:09.990 --> 01:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
disagreeing represent gr maybe I've just
 
01:30:12.629 --> 01:30:12.639 align:start position:0%
read too many amendments
 
01:30:14.870 --> 01:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
but I don't think that this needs
 
01:30:18.229 --> 01:30:18.239 align:start position:0%
clarification this makes this is very
 
01:30:20.750 --> 01:30:20.760 align:start position:0%
clear to me it says that public comments
 
01:30:25.189 --> 01:30:25.199 align:start position:0%
have to be created for the rule and if
 
01:30:28.270 --> 01:30:28.280 align:start position:0%
the report doesn't incorporate the
 
01:30:32.109 --> 01:30:32.119 align:start position:0%
comment they have to be able to explain
 
01:30:36.550 --> 01:30:36.560 align:start position:0%
why and how they can how their consider
 
01:30:38.950 --> 01:30:38.960 align:start position:0%
and how that that consideration was
 
01:30:41.390 --> 01:30:41.400 align:start position:0%
incorporated in their decision so this
 
01:30:43.430 --> 01:30:43.440 align:start position:0%
to me is is very clear I don't think we
 
01:30:45.030 --> 01:30:45.040 align:start position:0%
need to change
 
01:30:47.430 --> 01:30:47.440 align:start position:0%
anything all right
 
01:30:50.550 --> 01:30:50.560 align:start position:0%
well as the as the grammar mavens are
 
01:30:56.149 --> 01:30:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:57.990 --> 01:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:31:01.070 --> 01:31:01.080 align:start position:0%
so do you want to try and tweak the
 
01:31:03.709 --> 01:31:03.719 align:start position:0%
language or let's have a vote on but
 
01:31:06.709 --> 01:31:06.719 align:start position:0%
show of hands those who are in favor of
 
01:31:11.270 --> 01:31:11.280 align:start position:0%
the language as presented raise your
 
01:31:18.189 --> 01:31:18.199 align:start position:0%
hand two four six seven eight 10 12 14
 
01:31:22.470 --> 01:31:22.480 align:start position:0%
16 okay those who that's a majority so
 
01:31:25.350 --> 01:31:25.360 align:start position:0%
we will let the uh the grammar
 
01:31:31.030 --> 01:31:31.040 align:start position:0%
mavens argue about it be if it's go if
 
01:31:34.390 --> 01:31:34.400 align:start position:0%
it's totally clear to at least two
 
01:31:37.270 --> 01:31:37.280 align:start position:0%
random members of the committee who are
 
01:31:37.280 --> 01:31:38.109 align:start position:0%
random members of the committee who are
not

01:31:38.109 --> 01:31:38.119 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:31:41.750 --> 01:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
lawyers I think it makes sense
 
01:31:44.350 --> 01:31:44.360 align:start position:0%
then I think I think it's good
 
01:31:46.830 --> 01:31:46.840 align:start position:0%
enough all right Senate can always tweak
 
01:31:50.550 --> 01:31:50.560 align:start position:0%
it if I want you all right so any uh any
 
01:31:53.229 --> 01:31:53.239 align:start position:0%
other comments other than the uh the
 
01:31:53.239 --> 01:31:56.870 align:start position:0%
other comments other than the uh the
grammar

01:31:56.870 --> 01:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:59.070 --> 01:31:59.080 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none the motion is to
 
01:32:03.030 --> 01:32:03.040 align:start position:0%
