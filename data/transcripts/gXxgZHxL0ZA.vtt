being one of the first people to testify
 
00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much i am the vice
 
00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:14.799 align:start position:0%
chair of the school board here in
 
00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 align:start position:0%
manchester new hampshire
 
00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 align:start position:0%
and i wanted to um just sort of make the
 
00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 align:start position:0%
committee aware
 
00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 align:start position:0%
of some of the challenges that the
 
00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 align:start position:0%
school district faces here in manchester
 
00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:29.439 align:start position:0%
as you know because of the
 
00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 align:start position:0%
fewer number of students due to covet 19
 
00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 align:start position:0%
we will be
 
00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:36.079 align:start position:0%
losing um some
 
00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040 align:start position:0%
money coming to us because of the amount
 
00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 align:start position:0%
of money given per
 
00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
student and um that i'm just looking at
 
00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 align:start position:0%
my thing here i
 
00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 align:start position:0%
just i was expecting to be called so
 
00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
soon um
 
00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 align:start position:0%
we're looking at a retirement increase
 
00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:52.479 align:start position:0%
of two and a half million dollars
 
00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 align:start position:0%
we're looking at um
 
00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399 align:start position:0%
a reduction in fewer students of 1.2
 
00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 align:start position:0%
and um a four million dollar decrease in
 
00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:06.799 align:start position:0%
funding due to uh the free
 
00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 align:start position:0%
lunch applications and um so that's
 
00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 align:start position:0%
a total of 7.8 million dollars lost to
 
00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 align:start position:0%
the manchester school district
 
00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 align:start position:0%
students over this coming year
 
00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 align:start position:0%
and um so i would ask you please to take
 
00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 align:start position:0%
all of that into consideration as you
 
00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 align:start position:0%
as you put your budget together this
 
00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:26.879 align:start position:0%
year and
 
00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 align:start position:0%
anything you can do to forego um
 
00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 align:start position:0%
those um cuts to us
 
00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 align:start position:0%
this year would be very helpful
 
00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 align:start position:0%
as you know manchester has a great
 
00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 align:start position:0%
number of students with a lot of need we
 
00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 align:start position:0%
have a greater percentage of
 
00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 align:start position:0%
students with free reduced lunch than
 
00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 align:start position:0%
any other district in the state
 
00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 align:start position:0%
we also have the highest number of
 
00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 align:start position:0%
uh el learners um so
 
00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of needs here and
 
00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 align:start position:0%
certainly the pandemic has
 
00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 align:start position:0%
increased those needs tremendously and
 
00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 align:start position:0%
this is not the year
 
00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:06.800 align:start position:0%
to cut our budget so anything
 
00:03:10.149 --> 00:03:10.159 align:start position:0%
you can do to help out manchester
 
00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 align:start position:0%
would be in this budget would be greatly
 
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.750 align:start position:0%
would be in this budget would be greatly
appreciated

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 align:start position:0%
appreciated
 
00:03:16.869 --> 00:03:16.879 align:start position:0%
and i think that wraps it up for me and
 
00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 align:start position:0%
i wanted to say that originally i signed
 
00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 align:start position:0%
up opposed to this bill
 
00:03:22.149 --> 00:03:22.159 align:start position:0%
but that was i clicked the wrong button
 
00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 align:start position:0%
so that was a mistake i'm
 
00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 align:start position:0%
strongly support of um anything you can
 
00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 align:start position:0%
do to help out
 
00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 align:start position:0%
um our education system here in
 
00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.390 align:start position:0%
um our education system here in
manchester

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
manchester
 
00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony uh we've
 
00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 align:start position:0%
been given word that there is more money
 
00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:37.270 align:start position:0%
been given word that there is more money
coming

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 align:start position:0%
coming
 
00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 align:start position:0%
but what we are restricted by now is
 
00:03:41.589 --> 00:03:41.599 align:start position:0%
what the ways and means committee gave
 
00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:42.149 align:start position:0%
what the ways and means committee gave
us

00:03:42.149 --> 00:03:42.159 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:03:44.149 --> 00:03:44.159 align:start position:0%
for revenue estimates which was quite a
 
00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 align:start position:0%
bit lower than what the governor had
 
00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 align:start position:0%
and we have got to pass a budget that
 
00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:50.319 align:start position:0%
fits within the figures that the ways
 
00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 align:start position:0%
and means
 
00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
committee gave us however there is hope
 
00:03:54.869 --> 00:03:54.879 align:start position:0%
that more money is coming from the cares
 
00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:55.270 align:start position:0%
that more money is coming from the cares
act

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 align:start position:0%
act
 
00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 align:start position:0%
we don't know when it will arrive but
 
00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 align:start position:0%

i am here to uh testify in opposition of

section one i know that you just stated

there is an amendment
 
00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:21.360 align:start position:0%
amendment made but we have not seen it
 
00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:22.240 align:start position:0%
yet so
 
00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:25.120 align:start position:0%
i would still like to uh submit the
 
00:08:28.469 --> 00:08:28.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:31.120 align:start position:0%
for the reimbursements of sheriff's
 
00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:32.310 align:start position:0%
for the reimbursements of sheriff's
office

00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:32.320 align:start position:0%
office
 
00:08:33.829 --> 00:08:33.839 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the new hampshire sheriff's

on behalf of the new hampshire sheriff's
association

association
 
00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:37.360 align:start position:0%
we respectfully ask that you delete the
 
00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
section in the proposed hb2
 
00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:44.080 align:start position:0%
which regards the rsa-104
 
00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:47.120 align:start position:0%
colon 31 roman numerals 10
 
00:08:51.269 --> 00:08:51.279 align:start position:0%
and 11 in section 12 that's been added
 
00:08:52.949 --> 00:08:52.959 align:start position:0%
this would drastically reduce the rate
 
00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
of pay that has provided sheriff's
 
00:08:55.269 --> 00:08:55.279 align:start position:0%
payless with the
 
00:08:57.829 --> 00:08:57.839 align:start position:0%
judicial budget this amendment will
 
00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:00.240 align:start position:0%
possibly reduce the per diem rate
 
00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
from the current 108 to the rate of 2016
 
00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:05.680 align:start position:0%
of 80 dollars
 
00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:07.200 align:start position:0%
rates currently established in the
 
00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:09.120 align:start position:0%

whom the bailiffs work alongside of in
 
00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:18.240 align:start position:0%
many of the courts around the state
 
00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:19.680 align:start position:0%
this agreement was made by the
 
00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining unit
 
00:09:24.949 --> 00:09:24.959 align:start position:0%
of the aoc in the judicial branch
 
00:09:26.949 --> 00:09:26.959 align:start position:0%
some counties do provide a subsidy on
 
00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:28.560 align:start position:0%

which we need to provide under rsa 104
 
00:09:39.269 --> 00:09:39.279 align:start position:0%
5 number three states the bailouts shall
 
00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:40.880 align:start position:0%
provide or the sheriffs
 
00:09:43.509 --> 00:09:43.519 align:start position:0%
shall provide adequate security in all
 
00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
state courts
 
00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:48.080 align:start position:0%
except the supreme court
 
00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
we are all having trouble define current
 
00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:52.240 align:start position:0%
bailiffs to work this
 
00:09:55.509 --> 00:09:55.519 align:start position:0%
this would be about a 26.47
 
00:09:58.870 --> 00:09:58.880 align:start position:0%
rate cut if this were to pass
 
00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:00.640 align:start position:0%
this proposed bill could force sheriffs
 
00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:02.160 align:start position:0%
to place full-time deputies in the
 
00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:03.030 align:start position:0%
to place full-time deputies in the
courts

00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
courts
 
00:10:05.269 --> 00:10:05.279 align:start position:0%
and provide it to provide the adequate
 
00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
security needed
 
00:10:10.069 --> 00:10:10.079 align:start position:0%
and will be cost to the taxpayers in the
 
00:10:14.069 --> 00:10:14.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:17.120 align:start position:0%
and also possibly lose police services
 
00:10:18.949 --> 00:10:18.959 align:start position:0%
around the towns that have no police in
 
00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:20.240 align:start position:0%
these counties
 
00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:22.640 align:start position:0%
we respectfully ask that this section
 
00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:25.600 align:start position:0%
and amendments be removed from hb2
 
00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:27.440 align:start position:0%
as we see it as a cost shift to the
 
00:10:29.269 --> 00:10:29.279 align:start position:0%
counties and
 
00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:34.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:37.829 --> 00:10:37.839 align:start position:0%
thank you for consideration
 
00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:40.240 align:start position:0%
thank you sheriff um we did pass an
 
00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:41.110 align:start position:0%
thank you sheriff um we did pass an
amendment

00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:41.120 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:43.360 align:start position:0%
about an hour ago that will be
 
00:10:45.269 --> 00:10:45.279 align:start position:0%
publicized soon and you will get a look
 
00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:46.240 align:start position:0%
at it when it's
 
00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:48.880 align:start position:0%
available on the lba website uh an
 
00:10:50.069 --> 00:10:50.079 align:start position:0%
amendment to
 
00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:53.600 align:start position:0%
section one of hb2 and we believe it has
 
00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
solved the problem
 
00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:56.640 align:start position:0%
and as you point out it's been a
 
00:10:58.230 --> 00:10:58.240 align:start position:0%
long-standing problem
 
00:11:00.389 --> 00:11:00.399 align:start position:0%
going forward we think we fixed it so
 
00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:01.760 align:start position:0%
take a look at that we've
 
00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:03.440 align:start position:0%
changed where the fund sources were and
 
00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:04.880 align:start position:0%
things like that so
 
00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
we think we fixed everything we hope we
 
00:11:08.949 --> 00:11:08.959 align:start position:0%
can go back to uh
 
00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:12.880 align:start position:0%
camera arrangements again
 
00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:14.480 align:start position:0%
but we've got to convince the court of
 
00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
that that should save a lot of
 
00:11:17.509 --> 00:11:17.519 align:start position:0%
transportation money that you have to
 
00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:19.600 align:start position:0%
spend so
 
00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
take a look at it we think we fixed it
 
00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:23.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming before us
 
00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:28.640 align:start position:0%
what do we have here we have the nashua
 
00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:30.150 align:start position:0%
what do we have here we have the nashua
mayor

00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:30.160 align:start position:0%
mayor
 
00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:40.630 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:40.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:43.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um thank you for
 
00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:44.560 align:start position:0%
hearing me
 
00:11:46.949 --> 00:11:46.959 align:start position:0%
um i'm here to testify i guess in
 
00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:48.560 align:start position:0%
opposition of the bill
 
00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:52.000 align:start position:0%
because of the 73 million dollar
 
00:11:55.509 --> 00:11:55.519 align:start position:0%
gap in education funding between the
 
00:11:58.310 --> 00:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
last last fiscal year and the fiscal
 
00:11:58.320 --> 00:11:59.350 align:start position:0%
last last fiscal year and the fiscal
year

00:11:59.350 --> 00:11:59.360 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:12:02.629 --> 00:12:02.639 align:start position:0%
coming up this is the worst time to hit
 
00:12:04.389 --> 00:12:04.399 align:start position:0%
school districts across the state with
 
00:12:04.399 --> 00:12:05.750 align:start position:0%
school districts across the state with
this

00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:09.200 align:start position:0%
funding gap because the
 
00:12:11.509 --> 00:12:11.519 align:start position:0%
challenges caused by the pandemic are
 
00:12:13.269 --> 00:12:13.279 align:start position:0%
really unprecedented
 
00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:15.920 align:start position:0%
a lot of kids who have tried to try to
 
00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:17.440 align:start position:0%
learn remotely and
 
00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:20.320 align:start position:0%
all the problems associated with that
 
00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
also it really
 
00:12:24.629 --> 00:12:24.639 align:start position:0%
the the loss in education aid reflects
 
00:12:24.639 --> 00:12:25.590 align:start position:0%
the the loss in education aid reflects
some

00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:25.600 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:12:28.949 --> 00:12:28.959 align:start position:0%
artificial reductions in uh
 
00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:32.320 align:start position:0%
the so-called the free and reduced lunch
 
00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
kids and
 
00:12:36.629 --> 00:12:36.639 align:start position:0%
in attendance uh the those are the two
 
00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:38.320 align:start position:0%
main drivers of the reduction in the
 
00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:40.000 align:start position:0%
education costs
 
00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:44.560 align:start position:0%
two minutes the free and reduced lunch
 
00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:47.360 align:start position:0%
reduction has been caused by the fact
 
00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:48.069 align:start position:0%
reduction has been caused by the fact
that

00:12:48.069 --> 00:12:48.079 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
the department of agriculture federal
 
00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:54.560 align:start position:0%
made all free lunches all lunches free
 
00:12:57.269 --> 00:12:57.279 align:start position:0%
so there's no real incentive anymore for
 
00:12:58.949 --> 00:12:58.959 align:start position:0%
there's certainly much less incentive
 
00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:01.120 align:start position:0%
for families to qualify for free and
 
00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:02.800 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch
 
00:13:05.509 --> 00:13:05.519 align:start position:0%
we know that low-income families
 
00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:07.200 align:start position:0%
moderate income families have been hit
 
00:13:08.949 --> 00:13:08.959 align:start position:0%
very hard by the pandemic
 
00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:11.440 align:start position:0%
we expect we think that there are more
 
00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:13.680 align:start position:0%
free and reduced lunch qualifiers
 
00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:15.440 align:start position:0%
but that people just haven't had to
 
00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
haven't filled out the paperwork so
 
00:13:18.389 --> 00:13:18.399 align:start position:0%
that's an artificial
 
00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
reduction also the reduction in
 
00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:25.200 align:start position:0%
enrollments is also artificial
 
00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:26.560 align:start position:0%
i'm just telling you nashville's
 
00:13:28.629 --> 00:13:28.639 align:start position:0%
experience because i think it's typical
 
00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:31.120 align:start position:0%
almost all the reduction comes from the
 
00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:31.829 align:start position:0%
almost all the reduction comes from the
pre-k

00:13:31.829 --> 00:13:31.839 align:start position:0%
pre-k
 
00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
and kindergarten levels where when the
 
00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:37.120 align:start position:0%
schools were remote
 
00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
uh they're moving and they've moved into
 
00:13:41.509 --> 00:13:41.519 align:start position:0%
hybrid now but when they were
 
00:13:43.509 --> 00:13:43.519 align:start position:0%
there was no particular you know it was
 
00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:45.680 align:start position:0%
easy for a parent to say look i'm not
 
00:13:46.949 --> 00:13:46.959 align:start position:0%
going to send my kid to a remote
 
00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:49.680 align:start position:0%
kindergarten or remote pre-k
 
00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
so that caused an artificial reduction
 
00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:53.750 align:start position:0%
so that caused an artificial reduction
there

00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:13:55.670 --> 00:13:55.680 align:start position:0%
this comes at the same time when state
 
00:13:57.430 --> 00:13:57.440 align:start position:0%
retirement costs have been
 
00:13:59.430 --> 00:13:59.440 align:start position:0%
elevated for all cities and towns very
 
00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:01.110 align:start position:0%
elevated for all cities and towns very
dramatically

00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:01.120 align:start position:0%
dramatically
 
00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:04.240 align:start position:0%
so this this hit on the tax the property
 
00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:05.680 align:start position:0%
taxpayers is one
 
00:14:08.629 --> 00:14:08.639 align:start position:0%
that i don't believe can be afforded and
 
00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:09.440 align:start position:0%
i'm hoping
 
00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:12.800 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman members of the committee
 
00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:16.160 align:start position:0%
will at least equalize the education
 
00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:19.680 align:start position:0%
aid for the coming year with the
 
00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
coming fiscal year with the current
 
00:14:23.509 --> 00:14:23.519 align:start position:0%
fiscal year until we work out these
 
00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:26.720 align:start position:0%
pandemic related problems thank you for
 
00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:28.000 align:start position:0%
hearing me
 
00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:30.160 align:start position:0%
thank you we're we're aware of that
 
00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:31.760 align:start position:0%
problem we've heard about it several
 
00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:32.550 align:start position:0%
problem we've heard about it several
times

00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:32.560 align:start position:0%
times
 
00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:35.920 align:start position:0%
um this is this is a
 
00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
only on uh march 16th this budget won't
 
00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:41.680 align:start position:0%
be completed until sometime in june
 
00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
there is some possibility of more funds
 
00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
coming in in the cares act
 
00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
and some of them will be dead dedicated
 
00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
to education
 
00:14:50.389 --> 00:14:50.399 align:start position:0%
in the interim we don't have that much
 
00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
money that for
 
00:14:53.189 --> 00:14:53.199 align:start position:0%
what's been asked but we're hoping that
 
00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
there'll be some in that and also
 
00:14:58.310 --> 00:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
the if in fact the revenue picture
 
00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:00.800 align:start position:0%
improves which some people think
 
00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
uh march and april being big months for
 
00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:04.389 align:start position:0%
uh march and april being big months for
revenue

00:15:04.389 --> 00:15:04.399 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:06.720 align:start position:0%
then we will have more figures to work
 
00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:08.160 align:start position:0%
with but we're stuck with what
 
00:15:10.949 --> 00:15:10.959 align:start position:0%
the figures we got in february so but
 
00:15:12.949 --> 00:15:12.959 align:start position:0%
i'm looking forward to rosie days and
 
00:15:14.949 --> 00:15:14.959 align:start position:0%
hopefully we're all out well hopefully
 
00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:16.160 align:start position:0%
hopefully they will come
 
00:15:19.189 --> 00:15:19.199 align:start position:0%

00:15:38.949 --> 00:15:38.959 align:start position:0%
new hampshire the national alliance on
 
00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:40.160 align:start position:0%
mental illness
 
00:15:41.749 --> 00:15:41.759 align:start position:0%
our mission is to improve the lives of
 
00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:43.680 align:start position:0%
all people impacted by mental illness
 
00:15:45.189 --> 00:15:45.199 align:start position:0%
and or suicide
 
00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:47.680 align:start position:0%
during governor sununu budget address he
 
00:15:49.269 --> 00:15:49.279 align:start position:0%
once again stated that new hampshire is
 
00:15:50.949 --> 00:15:50.959 align:start position:0%
in a mental health crisis
 
00:15:52.629 --> 00:15:52.639 align:start position:0%
and i'm here to ask you to fully fund
 
00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
mental health services as proposed in
 
00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget
 
00:15:57.990 --> 00:15:58.000 align:start position:0%
the crisis has been exacerbated by the
 
00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:00.160 align:start position:0%
pandemic with significant increases in
 
00:16:01.749 --> 00:16:01.759 align:start position:0%
stress anxiety
 
00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
and depression across all ages though
 
00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
particularly impacting children and
 
00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:06.790 align:start position:0%
particularly impacting children and
youth

00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:06.800 align:start position:0%
youth
 
00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
the most visible symptom of the board is
 
00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
the boarding of individuals in a mental
 
00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
health crisis in emergency departments
 
00:16:14.069 --> 00:16:14.079 align:start position:0%
while waiting for an inpatient bed
 
00:16:15.749 --> 00:16:15.759 align:start position:0%
this is a practice nami new hampshire
 
00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:17.360 align:start position:0%
has long described as wrong
 
00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
medically legally ethically morally and
 
00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:22.160 align:start position:0%
economically during the past month we've
 
00:16:24.069 --> 00:16:24.079 align:start position:0%
exceeded previous highs
 
00:16:25.829 --> 00:16:25.839 align:start position:0%
of the numbers of people being boarded
 
00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:27.920 align:start position:0%
with 51 children being boarded on
 
00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:29.600 align:start position:0%
february 14th
 
00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
and a combined high of 89 children and
 
00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:32.790 align:start position:0%
and a combined high of 89 children and
adults

00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:32.800 align:start position:0%
adults
 
00:16:35.829 --> 00:16:35.839 align:start position:0%
on february 17th emergency department
 
00:16:37.509 --> 00:16:37.519 align:start position:0%
boarding is the tip of the proverbial
 
00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
iceberg relative to costly access to
 
00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
mental health care
 
00:16:42.389 --> 00:16:42.399 align:start position:0%
there are long waits for outpatient
 
00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:44.480 align:start position:0%
treatment as well workforce shortages
 
00:16:46.389 --> 00:16:46.399 align:start position:0%
pose an ongoing challenge
 
00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:48.320 align:start position:0%
to addressing this crisis and fully
 
00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
funding the state's loan repayment
 
00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:50.790 align:start position:0%
funding the state's loan repayment
program

00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:50.800 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:16:52.629 --> 00:16:52.639 align:start position:0%
is critical to addressing mental health
 
00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:54.800 align:start position:0%
and other health related fields
 
00:16:56.870 --> 00:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
suicide continues to be a significant
 
00:16:59.269 --> 00:16:59.279 align:start position:0%
public health issue in our state as well
 
00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:01.120 align:start position:0%
with suicide being the second leading
 
00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:02.320 align:start position:0%
cause of death after
 
00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
accidental injury in new hampshire for
 
00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:06.640 align:start position:0%
those ages 10 through 34.
 
00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
we anticipate that the mental health
 
00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:10.400 align:start position:0%
impacts of the pandemic will continue
 
00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
for some time to come
 
00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:14.400 align:start position:0%
and will impact children parents older
 
00:17:16.309 --> 00:17:16.319 align:start position:0%
adults and across many sectors of our
 
00:17:16.319 --> 00:17:17.270 align:start position:0%
adults and across many sectors of our
workforce

00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
workforce
 
00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
we're already seeing evidence of this we
 
00:17:21.189 --> 00:17:21.199 align:start position:0%
must continue the work begun during the
 
00:17:23.669 --> 00:17:23.679 align:start position:0%
2019 legislative session of implementing
 
00:17:25.590 --> 00:17:25.600 align:start position:0%
the key recommendations of the
 
00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:28.000 align:start position:0%
2019 10-year mental health plan this
 
00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:29.440 align:start position:0%
includes continuing
 
00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
to focus on developing a continuum of
 
00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
community-based services for mental
 
00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:35.360 align:start position:0%

services
 
00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:46.880 align:start position:0%
we must also move ahead with building a
 
00:17:48.789 --> 00:17:48.799 align:start position:0%
new forensic hospital in order to end
 
00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:50.240 align:start position:0%

the hhs

thank you i'm calling to
 
00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:55.360 align:start position:0%
ask the committee to i'm in favor of hb1
 
00:20:57.270 --> 00:20:57.280 align:start position:0%
particularly all the line items under
 
00:20:59.669 --> 00:20:59.679 align:start position:0%
the bureau of developmental services
 
00:21:02.149 --> 00:21:02.159 align:start position:0%
i'm asking you to support fully funding
 
00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:03.200 align:start position:0%
those and
 
00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:06.320 align:start position:0%
if if you're feeling you know generous
 
00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
increasing those amounts i am the parent
 
00:21:13.029 --> 00:21:13.039 align:start position:0%
of a 39 year old adult young woman with
 
00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
developmental disability disabilities
 
00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
significant disabilities she requires
 
00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
full care
 
00:21:24.149 --> 00:21:24.159 align:start position:0%
my angle on this is i'm 63 years old now
 
00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:27.200 align:start position:0%
she's getting very heavy to carry around
 
00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:30.640 align:start position:0%
and i don't anticipate that my physical
 
00:21:33.909 --> 00:21:33.919 align:start position:0%
ability is going to improve
 
00:21:36.789 --> 00:21:36.799 align:start position:0%
so more and more and more the demands of
 
00:21:36.799 --> 00:21:37.270 align:start position:0%
so more and more and more the demands of
her

00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:37.280 align:start position:0%
her
 
00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:40.400 align:start position:0%
care needs to fall to staff she's got
 
00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:41.840 align:start position:0%
wonderful staff
 
00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:44.720 align:start position:0%
but they're getting older too and i'm
 
00:21:46.549 --> 00:21:46.559 align:start position:0%
sure you're all aware of the workforce
 
00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:48.240 align:start position:0%
shortage we have
 
00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:51.440 align:start position:0%
because we just can't pay people enough
 
00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:53.200 align:start position:0%
or we haven't been paying people enough
 
00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:54.080 align:start position:0%
to become just
 
00:21:56.310 --> 00:21:56.320 align:start position:0%
direct support professionals and do this
 
00:21:59.590 --> 00:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
very challenging work
 
00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:01.440 align:start position:0%
so one of the things that i worry about
 
00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:03.200 align:start position:0%
as i'm getting older is what in the name
 
00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:04.720 align:start position:0%
of heaven is going to happen to my
 
00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:05.350 align:start position:0%
of heaven is going to happen to my
daughter

00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:05.360 align:start position:0%
daughter
 
00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:08.480 align:start position:0%
when i'm not here anymore to provide the
 
00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
many hours
 
00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
that i still do provide in addition to
 
00:22:14.149 --> 00:22:14.159 align:start position:0%
working full-time
 
00:22:17.270 --> 00:22:17.280 align:start position:0%
we really need to fund these services
 
00:22:19.669 --> 00:22:19.679 align:start position:0%
and consider giving direct support
 
00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
professionals enough of a living wage to
 
00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:24.400 align:start position:0%
attract people to the field
 
00:22:27.029 --> 00:22:27.039 align:start position:0%
that's one of the biggest problems um
 
00:22:28.549 --> 00:22:28.559 align:start position:0%
that we have
 
00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
implementing services our loved ones are
 
00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:32.960 align:start position:0%
eligible for
 
00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:35.840 align:start position:0%
so again i'm asking you to fully fund
 
00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:36.880 align:start position:0%
the line items
 
00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
under developmental services and
 
00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:40.000 align:start position:0%
increase them if
 
00:22:50.390 --> 00:22:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:52.310 --> 00:22:52.320 align:start position:0%
hhs has told us one of the biggest
 
00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:53.840 align:start position:0%
problems is finding space
 
00:22:55.990 --> 00:22:56.000 align:start position:0%
and finding people but we'll be working
 
00:22:57.830 --> 00:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
on that continuously but thank you for
 
00:22:58.870 --> 00:22:58.880 align:start position:0%

00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:01.360 align:start position:0%

00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
don't start a wait list
 
00:24:53.830 --> 00:24:53.840 align:start position:0%
for folks who are lower income and need
 
00:24:55.909 --> 00:24:55.919 align:start position:0%
this little bit of state assistance to
 
00:24:55.919 --> 00:24:57.029 align:start position:0%
this little bit of state assistance to
afford

00:24:57.029 --> 00:24:57.039 align:start position:0%
afford
 
00:25:00.549 --> 00:25:00.559 align:start position:0%
child care to keep working this is the
 
00:25:03.669 --> 00:25:03.679 align:start position:0%
very specifically for folks who are
 
00:25:04.950 --> 00:25:04.960 align:start position:0%
income eligible right now they're
 
00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
working hard
 
00:25:08.310 --> 00:25:08.320 align:start position:0%
and they need this child care the
 
00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:11.120 align:start position:0%
governor's budget does propose a cut
 
00:25:13.590 --> 00:25:13.600 align:start position:0%
of up to 20 percent here and the
 
00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
department has
 
00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
explained it's because there has been
 
00:25:20.789 --> 00:25:20.799 align:start position:0%
um uh expenditures haven't kept
 
00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:23.840 align:start position:0%
pace but um we really
 
00:25:26.230 --> 00:25:26.240 align:start position:0%
believe with the with the pandemic with
 
00:25:28.549 --> 00:25:28.559 align:start position:0%
all sorts of ways that you can support
 
00:25:31.029 --> 00:25:31.039 align:start position:0%
families who qualify for child care
 
00:25:32.870 --> 00:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
there could be very many more that are
 
00:25:35.190 --> 00:25:35.200 align:start position:0%
qualifying we ask that you
 
00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:37.360 align:start position:0%
have some kind of mechanism in place to
 
00:25:40.149 --> 00:25:40.159 align:start position:0%
make sure we don't start a wait list
 
00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:43.840 align:start position:0%
back in 2008 2009 during the last
 
00:25:45.990 --> 00:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
recession we did start a wait list in
 
00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:47.600 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and
 
00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
we found that many families were
 
00:25:53.430 --> 00:25:53.440 align:start position:0%
had to turn down jobs they were offered
 
00:25:55.269 --> 00:25:55.279 align:start position:0%
or leave a job they were currently
 
00:25:57.430 --> 00:25:57.440 align:start position:0%
in because they just couldn't find a
 
00:25:59.029 --> 00:25:59.039 align:start position:0%
child care that they afforded without
 
00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:00.240 align:start position:0%
this assistance
 
00:26:02.710 --> 00:26:02.720 align:start position:0%
so a wait list really hurts those
 
00:26:03.990 --> 00:26:04.000 align:start position:0%
families who are
 
00:26:07.029 --> 00:26:07.039 align:start position:0%
working hard to get ahead we hope you
 
00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:11.120 align:start position:0%
pay um special attention to 536
 
00:26:14.149 --> 00:26:14.159 align:start position:0%
and the other quick thing that i would
 
00:26:14.159 --> 00:26:14.710 align:start position:0%
and the other quick thing that i would
mention

00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:14.720 align:start position:0%
mention
 
00:26:18.269 --> 00:26:18.279 align:start position:0%
is that the right below 536 is
 
00:26:22.230 --> 00:26:22.240 align:start position:0%
564 protecting and preventing
 
00:26:24.549 --> 00:26:24.559 align:start position:0%
preventative child care this helps those
 
00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
families that are
 
00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:28.720 align:start position:0%
um children who have been victims of
 
00:26:29.909 --> 00:26:29.919 align:start position:0%
abuse or neglect
 
00:26:32.390 --> 00:26:32.400 align:start position:0%
or are at risk to make sure they have
 
00:26:34.390 --> 00:26:34.400 align:start position:0%
stable reliable child care
 
00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:36.240 align:start position:0%
and the department has asked for another
 
00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
2 million per year there and we
 
00:26:40.630 --> 00:26:40.640 align:start position:0%
support that as well so thank you very
 
00:26:42.149 --> 00:26:42.159 align:start position:0%

00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:16.480 align:start position:0%
good afternoon mr chairman and members
 
00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
of the committee
 
00:27:19.510 --> 00:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
my name is christina darling and i live
 
00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
in nashua new hampshire with my two boys
 
00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
caden and brennan both of whom receive
 
00:27:26.950 --> 00:27:26.960 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire child care scholarship
 
00:27:28.789 --> 00:27:28.799 align:start position:0%
allow me to start by saying that when i
 
00:27:31.269 --> 00:27:31.279 align:start position:0%
was a kid it was never my intention or
 
00:27:33.110 --> 00:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
desire to need to receive state
 
00:27:35.110 --> 00:27:35.120 align:start position:0%
assistance to survive
 
00:27:37.510 --> 00:27:37.520 align:start position:0%
however when i found myself suddenly a
 
00:27:38.789 --> 00:27:38.799 align:start position:0%
single mom
 
00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:41.360 align:start position:0%
with no local family support and two
 
00:27:43.350 --> 00:27:43.360 align:start position:0%
small boys who depended on me for
 
00:27:45.190 --> 00:27:45.200 align:start position:0%
absolutely everything
 
00:27:46.630 --> 00:27:46.640 align:start position:0%
survival was the only thing that
 
00:27:49.269 --> 00:27:49.279 align:start position:0%
mattered survival meant paying the bills
 
00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
which means i needed to work in order to
 
00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:53.440 align:start position:0%
work i needed child care
 
00:27:55.909 --> 00:27:55.919 align:start position:0%
to get child care i needed money it's a
 
00:27:57.990 --> 00:27:58.000 align:start position:0%
terrifying loop that i wouldn't wish on
 
00:28:00.789 --> 00:28:00.799 align:start position:0%
anyone without the new hampshire child
 
00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:02.960 align:start position:0%
care scholarship i'd still be stuck in
 
00:28:03.990 --> 00:28:04.000 align:start position:0%
that loop
 
00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
the scholarship allowed me to find
 
00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:07.360 align:start position:0%
full-time employment and keep my
 
00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:08.389 align:start position:0%
full-time employment and keep my
apartment

00:28:08.389 --> 00:28:08.399 align:start position:0%
apartment
 
00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:10.240 align:start position:0%
while also ensuring my children were
 
00:28:12.310 --> 00:28:12.320 align:start position:0%
safe and cared for while i was gone
 
00:28:13.909 --> 00:28:13.919 align:start position:0%
during the day
 
00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
you see i have big dreams for my family
 
00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:20.320 align:start position:0%
someday i hope to buy a house and take
 
00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:22.240 align:start position:0%
my kids on a vacation to experience a
 
00:28:23.909 --> 00:28:23.919 align:start position:0%
different culture and pay for them to go
 
00:28:26.149 --> 00:28:26.159 align:start position:0%
to college
 
00:28:27.990 --> 00:28:28.000 align:start position:0%
but even with my full-time job where i
 
00:28:30.230 --> 00:28:30.240 align:start position:0%
provide essential services and resources
 
00:28:32.470 --> 00:28:32.480 align:start position:0%
to families in affordable housing
 
00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:34.240 align:start position:0%
in a perfect month where no bills go
 
00:28:36.950 --> 00:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
over and my food cost stays down
 
00:28:39.190 --> 00:28:39.200 align:start position:0%
i can walk away with 75 dollars a month
 
00:28:40.870 --> 00:28:40.880 align:start position:0%
to put in savings
 
00:28:42.149 --> 00:28:42.159 align:start position:0%
believe it or not that's more than i
 
00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:44.240 align:start position:0%
ever have before
 
00:28:45.669 --> 00:28:45.679 align:start position:0%
if i didn't have access to the child
 
00:28:47.909 --> 00:28:47.919 align:start position:0%
care scholarship i'd be back to juggling
 
00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:49.360 align:start position:0%
my bills and trying to explain to my
 
00:28:51.029 --> 00:28:51.039 align:start position:0%
kids why we don't have power when all of
 
00:28:52.870 --> 00:28:52.880 align:start position:0%
our neighbors do
 
00:28:54.310 --> 00:28:54.320 align:start position:0%
i want to take a moment just to tell you
 
00:28:55.990 --> 00:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
about my sister she's an essential

income she made
 
00:29:07.669 --> 00:29:07.679 align:start position:0%
working with our most vulnerable was
 
00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:09.760 align:start position:0%

for 20 years i've experienced the impact
 
00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:49.440 align:start position:0%
of the employment related child care
 
00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:50.389 align:start position:0%
of the employment related child care
scholarship

00:30:50.389 --> 00:30:50.399 align:start position:0%
scholarship
 
00:30:52.389 --> 00:30:52.399 align:start position:0%
and in coast especially it's not
 
00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:54.720 align:start position:0%
uncommon to consistently have 50 percent
 
00:30:55.510 --> 00:30:55.520 align:start position:0%
of our children
 
00:30:58.549 --> 00:30:58.559 align:start position:0%
qualifying for child care scholarship
 
00:31:00.870 --> 00:31:00.880 align:start position:0%
i remember a time when when employment
 
00:31:02.070 --> 00:31:02.080 align:start position:0%
related child care
 
00:31:04.950 --> 00:31:04.960 align:start position:0%
scholarship was underfunded and that had
 
00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:05.669 align:start position:0%
scholarship was underfunded and that had
created

00:31:05.669 --> 00:31:05.679 align:start position:0%
created
 
00:31:08.789 --> 00:31:08.799 align:start position:0%
a waiting list i recall on many
 
00:31:10.470 --> 00:31:10.480 align:start position:0%
occasions a mom
 
00:31:13.029 --> 00:31:13.039 align:start position:0%
being ready to re-enter the workforce
 
00:31:14.149 --> 00:31:14.159 align:start position:0%
after being home with their young
 
00:31:15.509 --> 00:31:15.519 align:start position:0%
children only to find
 
00:31:17.509 --> 00:31:17.519 align:start position:0%
that they were wait listed and to
 
00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:19.120 align:start position:0%
receive child care assistance
 
00:31:22.710 --> 00:31:22.720 align:start position:0%
they had to defer the job and inform
 
00:31:25.990 --> 00:31:26.000 align:start position:0%
their potential employer who was eager
 
00:31:26.870 --> 00:31:26.880 align:start position:0%
to hire
 
00:31:28.310 --> 00:31:28.320 align:start position:0%
that they would not be rejoining the
 
00:31:30.389 --> 00:31:30.399 align:start position:0%
workforce after all
 
00:31:32.310 --> 00:31:32.320 align:start position:0%
currently in co-op specifically in
 
00:31:34.549 --> 00:31:34.559 align:start position:0%
colebrook we're experiencing an increase
 
00:31:35.990 --> 00:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
in manufacturing
 
00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:38.640 align:start position:0%
and a workforce shortage it is critical
 
00:31:39.590 --> 00:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
that families
 
00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:41.440 align:start position:0%
continue to be able to access high
 
00:31:43.590 --> 00:31:43.600 align:start position:0%
quality child care
 
00:31:45.509 --> 00:31:45.519 align:start position:0%
and without that access the workforce
 
00:31:47.269 --> 00:31:47.279 align:start position:0%
will continue to be stifled
 
00:31:48.870 --> 00:31:48.880 align:start position:0%
and this economic growth opportunity
 
00:31:51.269 --> 00:31:51.279 align:start position:0%
will be seriously interrupted
 
00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:52.960 align:start position:0%
access to child care is critical in
 
00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:54.720 align:start position:0%
rebuilding new hampshire's economy
 
00:31:56.630 --> 00:31:56.640 align:start position:0%
and up here in coast we have
 
00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:57.909 align:start position:0%
and up here in coast we have
opportunities

00:31:57.909 --> 00:31:57.919 align:start position:0%
opportunities
 
00:32:01.269 --> 00:32:01.279 align:start position:0%
now to rebuild but these opportunities
 
00:32:03.269 --> 00:32:03.279 align:start position:0%
can only be realized when parents have
 
00:32:04.950 --> 00:32:04.960 align:start position:0%
access to child care
 
00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:06.720 align:start position:0%
a fully funded employment related
 
00:32:08.070 --> 00:32:08.080 align:start position:0%
assistance budget is
 
00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:11.200 align:start position:0%
key to this rebuild thank you
 
00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:28.789 --> 00:32:28.799 align:start position:0%

00:32:36.789 --> 00:32:36.799 align:start position:0%

00:37:24.310 --> 00:37:24.320 align:start position:0%
formerly incarcerated individuals
 
00:37:26.390 --> 00:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
i paroled from the prison system in 2019
 
00:37:29.109 --> 00:37:29.119 align:start position:0%
and over the 13 years i was incarcerated
 
00:37:31.030 --> 00:37:31.040 align:start position:0%
i met and saw many people parole from
 
00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
the prison system
 
00:37:34.069 --> 00:37:34.079 align:start position:0%
i don't personally know every individual
 
00:37:36.069 --> 00:37:36.079 align:start position:0%
who's paroled from the prison system but
 
00:37:37.990 --> 00:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
everyone i personally know that has been
 
00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:40.240 align:start position:0%
rehabilitated has participated
 
00:37:41.910 --> 00:37:41.920 align:start position:0%
in the educational opportunities
 
00:37:44.069 --> 00:37:44.079 align:start position:0%
provided at the dlc
 
00:37:45.750 --> 00:37:45.760 align:start position:0%
the education department provides an
 
00:37:46.950 --> 00:37:46.960 align:start position:0%
environment where people learn a
 
00:37:48.630 --> 00:37:48.640 align:start position:0%
rehabilitative mode of thinking
 
00:37:51.030 --> 00:37:51.040 align:start position:0%
and it's a place where uh hope is
 
00:37:52.310 --> 00:37:52.320 align:start position:0%
instilled in others to see
 
00:37:53.990 --> 00:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
opportunities available through
 
00:37:56.150 --> 00:37:56.160 align:start position:0%
education and that is so important
 
00:37:57.670 --> 00:37:57.680 align:start position:0%
because we live in a society where the
 
00:37:59.829 --> 00:37:59.839 align:start position:0%
value of education is underscored by the
 
00:38:00.630 --> 00:38:00.640 align:start position:0%
fact that
 
00:38:02.470 --> 00:38:02.480 align:start position:0%
this information is required on every
 
00:38:04.390 --> 00:38:04.400 align:start position:0%
job application i can think of
 
00:38:05.589 --> 00:38:05.599 align:start position:0%
so i don't understand how this
 
00:38:07.750 --> 00:38:07.760 align:start position:0%
legislator could consider removing one
 
00:38:09.430 --> 00:38:09.440 align:start position:0%
of the most critical tools used to
 
00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:10.150 align:start position:0%
of the most critical tools used to
helping

00:38:10.150 --> 00:38:10.160 align:start position:0%
helping
 
00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:12.400 align:start position:0%
re-entering society members succeed in
 
00:38:14.069 --> 00:38:14.079 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire community
 
00:38:15.670 --> 00:38:15.680 align:start position:0%
and this leads to the second component
 
00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:17.200 align:start position:0%
of re-entry which is transitional
 
00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:18.710 align:start position:0%
of re-entry which is transitional
housing

00:38:18.710 --> 00:38:18.720 align:start position:0%
housing
 
00:38:20.550 --> 00:38:20.560 align:start position:0%
eliminating transitional housing from
 
00:38:22.390 --> 00:38:22.400 align:start position:0%
the budget closes the doors both
 
00:38:24.470 --> 00:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
literally and figuratively on those
 
00:38:25.829 --> 00:38:25.839 align:start position:0%
residents who are
 
00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:29.440 align:start position:0%
in those housing units the transitional
 
00:38:30.390 --> 00:38:30.400 align:start position:0%
housing system
 
00:38:33.670 --> 00:38:33.680 align:start position:0%
is a system that is built to help people
 
00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
continue their rehabilitative path back
 
00:38:36.950 --> 00:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
into the community
 
00:38:39.030 --> 00:38:39.040 align:start position:0%
as they experience the shock of going
 
00:38:40.630 --> 00:38:40.640 align:start position:0%
from one world to the next
 
00:38:42.630 --> 00:38:42.640 align:start position:0%
as well as preparing them for the
 
00:38:44.390 --> 00:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
challenges that they're going to
 
00:38:47.109 --> 00:38:47.119 align:start position:0%
go through when they parole so i
 
00:38:49.109 --> 00:38:49.119 align:start position:0%
respectfully ask that this
 
00:38:52.230 --> 00:38:52.240 align:start position:0%
committee places both the education
 
00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:53.190 align:start position:0%
committee places both the education
department

00:38:53.190 --> 00:38:53.200 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:38:55.190 --> 00:38:55.200 align:start position:0%
and the transitional housing back into
 
00:38:58.710 --> 00:38:58.720 align:start position:0%
the budget and approves it
 
00:39:01.349 --> 00:39:01.359 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire thank you i have
 
00:39:02.390 --> 00:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
good news for you
 
00:39:04.950 --> 00:39:04.960 align:start position:0%
about 11 30 we restored the education
 
00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:06.720 align:start position:0%
for the corrections department
 
00:39:09.190 --> 00:39:09.200 align:start position:0%
however long-term transitional housing
 
00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
which we've been asked for in many
 
00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:11.349 align:start position:0%
which we've been asked for in many
different

00:39:11.349 --> 00:39:11.359 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:39:13.190 --> 00:39:13.200 align:start position:0%
is a long-term effect and it's very
 
00:39:15.030 --> 00:39:15.040 align:start position:0%
difficult to either build it or locate
 
00:39:16.550 --> 00:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
it but we'll keep working on it thank

this is true every day and that resolve
 
00:40:34.309 --> 00:40:34.319 align:start position:0%
has certainly been
 
00:40:36.550 --> 00:40:36.560 align:start position:0%
demonstrated throughout the past year
 
00:40:38.390 --> 00:40:38.400 align:start position:0%
but hospitals have been challenged over
 
00:40:40.390 --> 00:40:40.400 align:start position:0%
the past year as we have responded to
 
00:40:41.750 --> 00:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
the kobit 19
 
00:40:44.470 --> 00:40:44.480 align:start position:0%
pandemic when cobit 19 arrived in new
 
00:40:46.390 --> 00:40:46.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire hospitals became the front
 
00:40:48.390 --> 00:40:48.400 align:start position:0%
lines of defense against the highly

our hospitals have responded with great

00:41:11.750 --> 00:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
and care to ensure that their patients

were able to get the care that they
 
00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:14.230 align:start position:0%
were able to get the care that they

needed
 
00:41:16.710 --> 00:41:16.720 align:start position:0%
the pandemic has challenged us all and
 
00:41:18.069 --> 00:41:18.079 align:start position:0%
working together we believe we can
 
00:41:20.069 --> 00:41:20.079 align:start position:0%
emerge from this crisis
 
00:41:22.309 --> 00:41:22.319 align:start position:0%
but it will take great care to ensure
 
00:41:23.670 --> 00:41:23.680 align:start position:0%
that the new hampshire
 
00:41:26.390 --> 00:41:26.400 align:start position:0%
does have does so in ensuring that we

does have does so in ensuring that we
are

00:41:26.710 --> 00:41:26.720 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:41:28.550 --> 00:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
able to serve the citizens across the
 
00:41:30.069 --> 00:41:30.079 align:start position:0%
state we are
 
00:41:32.470 --> 00:41:32.480 align:start position:0%
also very focused on the medicaid
 
00:41:33.990 --> 00:41:34.000 align:start position:0%
program and it is absolutely
 
00:41:35.910 --> 00:41:35.920 align:start position:0%
essential that we have a robust and
 
00:41:37.829 --> 00:41:37.839 align:start position:0%
effective medicaid program that helps to
 
00:41:39.270 --> 00:41:39.280 align:start position:0%
ensure recipients
 
00:41:41.349 --> 00:41:41.359 align:start position:0%
are getting the right care at the right
 
00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:43.280 align:start position:0%
time in the right place
 
00:41:45.910 --> 00:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
and we are appreciative that the house
 
00:41:46.790 --> 00:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
bill one
 
00:41:49.270 --> 00:41:49.280 align:start position:0%
put forth by governor sununu includes
 
00:41:50.309 --> 00:41:50.319 align:start position:0%
the medicaid
 
00:41:52.309 --> 00:41:52.319 align:start position:0%
enhancement tax and medicaid
 
00:41:53.670 --> 00:41:53.680 align:start position:0%

program settlement agreement provisions
 
00:41:57.030 --> 00:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
that were
 
00:41:59.349 --> 00:41:59.359 align:start position:0%
negotiated years ago and we appreciate
 
00:42:01.589 --> 00:42:01.599 align:start position:0%
that we are also very appreciative of
 
00:42:01.599 --> 00:42:02.630 align:start position:0%
that we are also very appreciative of
this

00:42:02.630 --> 00:42:02.640 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
rate increase that were included in the
 
00:42:07.109 --> 00:42:07.119 align:start position:0%
last budget and maintained in the state
 
00:42:09.670 --> 00:42:09.680 align:start position:0%
in the budget before the house the a
 
00:42:11.430 --> 00:42:11.440 align:start position:0%
budget is designed to address
 
00:42:13.109 --> 00:42:13.119 align:start position:0%
key priorities in the state and there
 
00:42:15.430 --> 00:42:15.440 align:start position:0%
are many that we navigate
 
00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:18.240 align:start position:0%
through the coveted 19 pandemic however
 
00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:19.200 align:start position:0%
there is no more
 
00:42:21.270 --> 00:42:21.280 align:start position:0%
urgent and pressing priority than the
 
00:42:23.190 --> 00:42:23.200 align:start position:0%
addressing the behavioral health crisis
 
00:42:24.790 --> 00:42:24.800 align:start position:0%
facing new hampshire
 
00:42:27.270 --> 00:42:27.280 align:start position:0%
as we have said before any plan that is
 
00:42:29.430 --> 00:42:29.440 align:start position:0%
focused on solving the totality of the
 
00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:29.990 align:start position:0%
focused on solving the totality of the
behavioral

00:42:29.990 --> 00:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
behavioral
 
00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
health crisis must be a clear focus on
 
00:42:34.710 --> 00:42:34.720 align:start position:0%
addressing the challenge of patients
 
00:42:37.030 --> 00:42:37.040 align:start position:0%
waiting in the emergency rooms today
 
00:42:39.750 --> 00:42:39.760 align:start position:0%
tomorrow next week and next year it

essential workers
 
00:43:57.270 --> 00:43:57.280 align:start position:0%
so that they could continue working
 
00:43:59.829 --> 00:43:59.839 align:start position:0%
historically around 40 percent of

true of a town
 
00:44:11.910 --> 00:44:11.920 align:start position:0%
like meredith but that need is
 
00:44:13.430 --> 00:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
absolutely there
 
00:44:16.230 --> 00:44:16.240 align:start position:0%
in a tourist town many of the people who
 
00:44:16.870 --> 00:44:16.880 align:start position:0%
live here

we're now getting more and more families
 
00:44:23.589 --> 00:44:23.599 align:start position:0%
calling who
 
00:44:25.829 --> 00:44:25.839 align:start position:0%
aren't uh sorry who are going back to

work and who qualify for the child care
 
00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:28.630 align:start position:0%

scholarship
 
00:44:30.790 --> 00:44:30.800 align:start position:0%
we believe the need for those families
 
00:44:31.750 --> 00:44:31.760 align:start position:0%
to be able
 
00:44:33.990 --> 00:44:34.000 align:start position:0%
to access affordable childcare is going
 
00:44:35.270 --> 00:44:35.280 align:start position:0%
to be
 
00:44:38.390 --> 00:44:38.400 align:start position:0%
it was before if not a greater need if
 
00:44:39.670 --> 00:44:39.680 align:start position:0%
there ends up being a waitlist for
 
00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:40.390 align:start position:0%
there ends up being a waitlist for
scholarships

00:44:40.390 --> 00:44:40.400 align:start position:0%
scholarships
 
00:44:42.630 --> 00:44:42.640 align:start position:0%
these parents can't work uh when this
 
00:44:43.910 --> 00:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
happened a few
 
00:44:46.470 --> 00:44:46.480 align:start position:0%
years back we know that it means that
 
00:44:48.550 --> 00:44:48.560 align:start position:0%
they needed to qualify for higher levels
 
00:44:50.550 --> 00:44:50.560 align:start position:0%
of state assistance
 
00:44:53.190 --> 00:44:53.200 align:start position:0%
through the years i personally have seen
 
00:44:54.870 --> 00:44:54.880 align:start position:0%
the scholarship program help families
 
00:44:56.309 --> 00:44:56.319 align:start position:0%
get ahead
 
00:44:57.750 --> 00:44:57.760 align:start position:0%
these families are able to afford
 
00:44:59.270 --> 00:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
childcare to grow in their job and
 
00:45:01.589 --> 00:45:01.599 align:start position:0%
contribute to the economy
 
00:45:03.750 --> 00:45:03.760 align:start position:0%
i would like to tell you about one of
 
00:45:05.910 --> 00:45:05.920 align:start position:0%
our former parents
 
00:45:08.309 --> 00:45:08.319 align:start position:0%
she was a single mom she had a toddler
 
00:45:10.390 --> 00:45:10.400 align:start position:0%
and she had told us that she wanted to
 
00:45:12.710 --> 00:45:12.720 align:start position:0%
own her own business someday that she
 
00:45:13.910 --> 00:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
had known from the time she was a
 
00:45:15.910 --> 00:45:15.920 align:start position:0%
teenager what she wanted to do in life
 
00:45:18.390 --> 00:45:18.400 align:start position:0%
and that's what she was working toward
 
00:45:19.750 --> 00:45:19.760 align:start position:0%
she qualified for the scholarship
 
00:45:21.750 --> 00:45:21.760 align:start position:0%
program and her son attended our program
 
00:45:23.589 --> 00:45:23.599 align:start position:0%
while she worked
 
00:45:25.670 --> 00:45:25.680 align:start position:0%
we got to see her start her business and
 
00:45:27.510 --> 00:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
then grow it year after year
 
00:45:29.349 --> 00:45:29.359 align:start position:0%
and she is now a successful
 
00:45:30.870 --> 00:45:30.880 align:start position:0%
businesswoman who
 
00:45:33.510 --> 00:45:33.520 align:start position:0%
not only is incredibly successful in her
 
00:45:34.230 --> 00:45:34.240 align:start position:0%
field but
 
00:45:37.349 --> 00:45:37.359 align:start position:0%
also now gives back to the community she
 
00:45:40.150 --> 00:45:40.160 align:start position:0%
um has taught classes and she regularly
 
00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:41.030 align:start position:0%
um has taught classes and she regularly
donates

00:45:41.030 --> 00:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
donates
 
00:45:42.870 --> 00:45:42.880 align:start position:0%
to local charities using her business

to local charities using her business
profits

00:45:44.069 --> 00:45:44.079 align:start position:0%
profits
 
00:45:46.390 --> 00:45:46.400 align:start position:0%
if she hadn't been able to access this
 
00:45:48.309 --> 00:45:48.319 align:start position:0%
scholarship i don't think that she would
 
00:45:49.589 --> 00:45:49.599 align:start position:0%
be where she is today
 
00:45:52.309 --> 00:45:52.319 align:start position:0%

i'm an executive director
 
00:46:48.630 --> 00:46:48.640 align:start position:0%
at a nationally accredited child care
 
00:46:50.790 --> 00:46:50.800 align:start position:0%
center in kingston new hampshire

00:46:54.390 --> 00:46:54.400 align:start position:0%
keep enough funding
 
00:46:57.670 --> 00:46:57.680 align:start position:0%
in the new hampshire child care budget
 
00:47:00.870 --> 00:47:00.880 align:start position:0%
for scholarships because families
 
00:47:02.630 --> 00:47:02.640 align:start position:0%
this gives them that initial boost to
 
00:47:03.910 --> 00:47:03.920 align:start position:0%
get back to work
 
00:47:06.470 --> 00:47:06.480 align:start position:0%
and i seen so many families use this be
 
00:47:07.750 --> 00:47:07.760 align:start position:0%
able to get back to work
 
00:47:10.710 --> 00:47:10.720 align:start position:0%
start providing for their family and
 
00:47:11.670 --> 00:47:11.680 align:start position:0%
then later be
 
00:47:14.069 --> 00:47:14.079 align:start position:0%
able to self-sufficiently pay their
 
00:47:15.270 --> 00:47:15.280 align:start position:0%
child care
 
00:47:19.109 --> 00:47:19.119 align:start position:0%
and one of my examples is
 
00:47:22.630 --> 00:47:22.640 align:start position:0%
some an employee that is here at the
 
00:47:24.470 --> 00:47:24.480 align:start position:0%
kingston children's center
 
00:47:26.790 --> 00:47:26.800 align:start position:0%

care scholarship
 
00:47:30.870 --> 00:47:30.880 align:start position:0%
and without her here and without others
 
00:47:31.750 --> 00:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
like her here
 
00:47:35.270 --> 00:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
we would be short-staffed um
 
00:47:37.190 --> 00:47:37.200 align:start position:0%
and she has been able to go back to
 
00:47:39.670 --> 00:47:39.680 align:start position:0%
school since having her children
 
00:47:41.910 --> 00:47:41.920 align:start position:0%
attending here and using that child care
 
00:47:43.349 --> 00:47:43.359 align:start position:0%
scholarship and she
 
00:47:45.589 --> 00:47:45.599 align:start position:0%

childcare

00:47:46.790 --> 00:47:46.800 align:start position:0%
childcare
 
00:47:49.670 --> 00:47:49.680 align:start position:0%
but it was just a tremendous boost for
 
00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:50.069 align:start position:0%
but it was just a tremendous boost for
her

00:47:50.069 --> 00:47:50.079 align:start position:0%

00:48:32.950 --> 00:48:32.960 align:start position:0%
domestic and sexual violence
 
00:48:35.270 --> 00:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
i'm here today in support of house bill
 
00:48:37.109 --> 00:48:37.119 align:start position:0%
1 and the allocation for domestic
 
00:48:39.910 --> 00:48:39.920 align:start position:0%
violence and sexual assault services
 
00:48:41.670 --> 00:48:41.680 align:start position:0%
this allocation would ensure that the
 
00:48:43.510 --> 00:48:43.520 align:start position:0%
state budget adequately funds the
 
00:48:45.270 --> 00:48:45.280 align:start position:0%
life-saving services that are provided
 
00:48:47.030 --> 00:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
by our 13 crisis centers
 
00:48:48.790 --> 00:48:48.800 align:start position:0%
to address sexual assault and domestic
 
00:48:51.270 --> 00:48:51.280 align:start position:0%
violence across our state
 
00:48:52.870 --> 00:48:52.880 align:start position:0%
over the last two years new hampshire's
 
00:48:54.870 --> 00:48:54.880 align:start position:0%
crisis center served nearly thirty
 
00:48:57.349 --> 00:48:57.359 align:start position:0%
thousand individual victims including
 
00:48:59.190 --> 00:48:59.200 align:start position:0%
providing shelter to just over one
 
00:49:01.430 --> 00:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
thousand adults and children in our 12
 
00:49:03.750 --> 00:49:03.760 align:start position:0%
emergency domestic violence shelters
 
00:49:07.990 --> 00:49:08.000 align:start position:0%
for a total of over 86 000 bed nights
 
00:49:11.990 --> 00:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
yet at the same time 1 672 adults and
 
00:49:14.470 --> 00:49:14.480 align:start position:0%
740 children had to seek shelter
 
00:49:15.910 --> 00:49:15.920 align:start position:0%
elsewhere because we just didn't have
 
00:49:18.150 --> 00:49:18.160 align:start position:0%
the capacity in our programs
 
00:49:20.390 --> 00:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
as a state we have worked tirelessly to
 
00:49:22.309 --> 00:49:22.319 align:start position:0%
respond to the opioid crisis
 
00:49:23.990 --> 00:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
the lack of mental health services which
 
00:49:25.349 --> 00:49:25.359 align:start position:0%
you've heard about today
 
00:49:27.430 --> 00:49:27.440 align:start position:0%
to improve child protection and to
 
00:49:28.950 --> 00:49:28.960 align:start position:0%
address the shortages we are
 
00:49:31.430 --> 00:49:31.440 align:start position:0%
experiencing in adequate housing
 
00:49:33.910 --> 00:49:33.920 align:start position:0%
however we must continue to recognize
 
00:49:35.990 --> 00:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
that many individuals are in need of
 
00:49:38.630 --> 00:49:38.640 align:start position:0%
all of these services as a direct result
 
00:49:40.870 --> 00:49:40.880 align:start position:0%
of family violence domestic abuse and
 
00:49:42.630 --> 00:49:42.640 align:start position:0%
sexual assault
 
00:49:44.870 --> 00:49:44.880 align:start position:0%
when we as a state begin to respond
 
00:49:47.190 --> 00:49:47.200 align:start position:0%
earlier and more comprehensively
 
00:49:49.349 --> 00:49:49.359 align:start position:0%
to victimization and trauma we will
 
00:49:51.430 --> 00:49:51.440 align:start position:0%
reduce the impact and the cost of these
 
00:49:53.829 --> 00:49:53.839 align:start position:0%
crimes in our communities
 
00:49:55.430 --> 00:49:55.440 align:start position:0%
the essential role that crisis centers
 
00:49:57.270 --> 00:49:57.280 align:start position:0%
play in our communities to respond to
 
00:49:59.510 --> 00:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
trauma has become increasingly apparent
 
00:50:01.349 --> 00:50:01.359 align:start position:0%
over the last year as we have witnessed
 
00:50:02.870 --> 00:50:02.880 align:start position:0%
the devastating impact
 
00:50:05.030 --> 00:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
that the covet 19 pandemic has had in
 
00:50:06.710 --> 00:50:06.720 align:start position:0%
the granite state
 
00:50:08.950 --> 00:50:08.960 align:start position:0%
imagine the terror of being asked to
 
00:50:10.950 --> 00:50:10.960 align:start position:0%
shelter at home with the person who is
 
00:50:12.309 --> 00:50:12.319 align:start position:0%
battering or raping you
 
00:50:15.030 --> 00:50:15.040 align:start position:0%
every single day despite the added
 
00:50:16.870 --> 00:50:16.880 align:start position:0%
barriers that made it really challenging
 
00:50:18.790 --> 00:50:18.800 align:start position:0%
for victims to reach out to advocates
 
00:50:22.150 --> 00:50:22.160 align:start position:0%
crisis centers received nearly 100 000
 
00:50:23.670 --> 00:50:23.680 align:start position:0%
emergency calls
 
00:50:27.430 --> 00:50:27.440 align:start position:0%
through their crisis 2020 representing
 
00:50:32.549 --> 00:50:32.559 align:start position:0%
almost a 40 increase in calls from 2019.
 
00:50:34.150 --> 00:50:34.160 align:start position:0%
so what i hope this committee will
 
00:50:35.670 --> 00:50:35.680 align:start position:0%
consider is that when victims don't
 
00:50:36.710 --> 00:50:36.720 align:start position:0%
receive support
 
00:50:39.270 --> 00:50:39.280 align:start position:0%
especially as children the long-term
 
00:50:41.510 --> 00:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
effects of trauma manifest in a variety
 
00:50:42.069 --> 00:50:42.079 align:start position:0%
of ways
 
00:50:43.990 --> 00:50:44.000 align:start position:0%
including chronic physical and mental
 
00:50:45.109 --> 00:50:45.119 align:start position:0%
health issues
 
00:50:47.589 --> 00:50:47.599 align:start position:0%
depression suicide substance abuse
 
00:50:47.599 --> 00:50:48.390 align:start position:0%
depression suicide substance abuse
disorders

00:50:48.390 --> 00:50:48.400 align:start position:0%
disorders
 
00:50:51.589 --> 00:50:51.599 align:start position:0%
and difficulty maintaining employment
 
00:50:53.510 --> 00:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
when we as a state work to reduce
 
00:50:55.430 --> 00:50:55.440 align:start position:0%
domestic and sexual violence we will
 
00:50:55.440 --> 00:50:55.990 align:start position:0%
domestic and sexual violence we will
reduce

00:50:55.990 --> 00:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
reduce
 
00:50:57.670 --> 00:50:57.680 align:start position:0%
these negative impacts on new
 
00:50:59.190 --> 00:50:59.200 align:start position:0%
hampshire's communities
 
00:51:01.190 --> 00:51:01.200 align:start position:0%

and keep my employment
 
00:52:44.829 --> 00:52:44.839 align:start position:0%

as a child care administrator i know the
 
00:53:21.510 --> 00:53:21.520 align:start position:0%
impact having child care assistance has
 
00:53:24.790 --> 00:53:24.800 align:start position:0%
on our families and

pre-covered it was 175 members
 
00:53:37.990 --> 00:53:38.000 align:start position:0%
it is the assistance for families that
 
00:53:39.750 --> 00:53:39.760 align:start position:0%
makes it so they can continue
 
00:53:41.990 --> 00:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
employment and send their children to a
 
00:53:43.910 --> 00:53:43.920 align:start position:0%

we all know that in a stable nurturing
 
00:53:47.200 --> 00:53:49.589 align:start position:0%
we all know that in a stable nurturing
environment

00:53:49.589 --> 00:53:49.599 align:start position:0%
environment
 
00:53:51.750 --> 00:53:51.760 align:start position:0%
surrounded by attentive caregivers
 
00:53:53.670 --> 00:53:53.680 align:start position:0%
children are better able to acquire the

children are better able to acquire the
social

00:53:54.230 --> 00:53:54.240 align:start position:0%
social
 
00:53:57.190 --> 00:53:57.200 align:start position:0%
cognitive language and life skills that
 
00:54:00.549 --> 00:54:00.559 align:start position:0%
are so vital for future success
 
00:54:03.190 --> 00:54:03.200 align:start position:0%
such children are far more likely to
 
00:54:04.309 --> 00:54:04.319 align:start position:0%
grow into healthy
 
00:54:07.430 --> 00:54:07.440 align:start position:0%
happy and responsible adults they're
 
00:54:09.589 --> 00:54:09.599 align:start position:0%
more likely to succeed in school
 
00:54:11.510 --> 00:54:11.520 align:start position:0%
and on the job and raise healthy
 
00:54:13.589 --> 00:54:13.599 align:start position:0%
families of their own
 
00:54:15.510 --> 00:54:15.520 align:start position:0%
in other words if we want to be
 
00:54:17.030 --> 00:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
surrounded by great neighbors
 
00:54:19.190 --> 00:54:19.200 align:start position:0%
in a great community twenty years from
 
00:54:21.510 --> 00:54:21.520 align:start position:0%
now we need to lay the foundation for
 
00:54:22.549 --> 00:54:22.559 align:start position:0%
them today

state
 
00:55:30.789 --> 00:55:30.799 align:start position:0%
particularly in the rental market this
 
00:55:31.990 --> 00:55:32.000 align:start position:0%
is causing
 
00:55:35.030 --> 00:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
a financial hardship among many
 
00:55:37.750 --> 00:55:37.760 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire families who are paying
 
00:55:39.670 --> 00:55:39.680 align:start position:0%
more than 50
 
00:55:41.829 --> 00:55:41.839 align:start position:0%
of their monthly income towards their
 
00:55:41.839 --> 00:55:42.710 align:start position:0%
of their monthly income towards their
rent

00:55:42.710 --> 00:55:42.720 align:start position:0%
rent
 
00:55:44.630 --> 00:55:44.640 align:start position:0%
in fact over half of our renter
 
00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:45.750 align:start position:0%
in fact over half of our renter
population

00:55:45.750 --> 00:55:45.760 align:start position:0%
population
 
00:55:48.150 --> 00:55:48.160 align:start position:0%
which makes up about a third of all
 
00:55:49.750 --> 00:55:49.760 align:start position:0%
residents of new hampshire
 
00:55:52.390 --> 00:55:52.400 align:start position:0%
are paying too much when you pay too
 
00:55:53.750 --> 00:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
much for your rent it means you don't
 
00:55:54.710 --> 00:55:54.720 align:start position:0%
have money
 
00:55:57.510 --> 00:55:57.520 align:start position:0%
to put in the rest of your local economy
 
00:55:59.349 --> 00:55:59.359 align:start position:0%
in an otherwise strong economy before
 
00:56:01.109 --> 00:56:01.119 align:start position:0%
the pandemic
 
00:56:04.710 --> 00:56:04.720 align:start position:0%
housing was a weak spot for our state
 
00:56:06.549 --> 00:56:06.559 align:start position:0%
continues to challenge us i'd like to
 
00:56:08.230 --> 00:56:08.240 align:start position:0%
bring to the attention of this committee
 
00:56:10.069 --> 00:56:10.079 align:start position:0%
three aspects in the budget
 
00:56:13.750 --> 00:56:13.760 align:start position:0%
uh uh to consider as you consider hb1
 
00:56:15.109 --> 00:56:15.119 align:start position:0%
and hb2
 
00:56:18.069 --> 00:56:18.079 align:start position:0%
and as the when the budget comes back to
 
00:56:19.510 --> 00:56:19.520 align:start position:0%
you from the senate and you have a
 
00:56:19.520 --> 00:56:20.309 align:start position:0%
you from the senate and you have a
chance

00:56:20.309 --> 00:56:20.319 align:start position:0%
chance
 
00:56:22.069 --> 00:56:22.079 align:start position:0%
to consider appropriations in the
 
00:56:24.630 --> 00:56:24.640 align:start position:0%
committee of conference
 
00:56:25.910 --> 00:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
first i ask that you look at the
 
00:56:27.430 --> 00:56:27.440 align:start position:0%
affordable housing fund this is new
 
00:56:29.510 --> 00:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire's state housing trust fund
 
00:56:31.910 --> 00:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
where public dollars leverage private
 
00:56:31.920 --> 00:56:32.870 align:start position:0%
where public dollars leverage private
capital

00:56:32.870 --> 00:56:32.880 align:start position:0%
capital
 
00:56:36.390 --> 00:56:36.400 align:start position:0%
to build more affordable housing second
 
00:56:39.430 --> 00:56:39.440 align:start position:0%
ask you to consider funding for
 
00:56:41.990 --> 00:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
homeless shelter operations it cost
 
00:56:43.990 --> 00:56:44.000 align:start position:0%
about 47 dollars per person per
 
00:56:45.270 --> 00:56:45.280 align:start position:0%
night to shelter someone in new
 
00:56:47.670 --> 00:56:47.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire the state currently reimburses
 
00:56:49.670 --> 00:56:49.680 align:start position:0%
that service at eight dollars and eighty
 
00:56:49.680 --> 00:56:50.470 align:start position:0%
that service at eight dollars and eighty
cents

00:56:50.470 --> 00:56:50.480 align:start position:0%
cents
 
00:56:52.789 --> 00:56:52.799 align:start position:0%
uh so increased money for homeless
 
00:56:54.309 --> 00:56:54.319 align:start position:0%
shelter operations
 
00:56:56.950 --> 00:56:56.960 align:start position:0%
can provide at least some sustainability
 
00:56:58.390 --> 00:56:58.400 align:start position:0%
and help
 
00:57:00.470 --> 00:57:00.480 align:start position:0%
those shelters address the increase in
 
00:57:02.309 --> 00:57:02.319 align:start position:0%
homelessness and the rise in encampments
 
00:57:03.349 --> 00:57:03.359 align:start position:0%
in our state
 
00:57:06.069 --> 00:57:06.079 align:start position:0%
and finally i would just ask that you uh
 
00:57:06.079 --> 00:57:07.030 align:start position:0%
and finally i would just ask that you uh
consider

00:57:07.030 --> 00:57:07.040 align:start position:0%
consider
 
00:57:08.950 --> 00:57:08.960 align:start position:0%
um to keep the funding for the housing
 
00:57:10.470 --> 00:57:10.480 align:start position:0%
appeals board that the governor has
 
00:57:12.230 --> 00:57:12.240 align:start position:0%
included in his budget and with that
 
00:57:13.910 --> 00:57:13.920 align:start position:0%
i'll conclude my testimony thank you
 
00:57:15.190 --> 00:57:15.200 align:start position:0%

00:57:18.549 --> 00:57:18.559 align:start position:0%

representative oregon you want to mute
 
00:57:33.280 --> 00:57:34.789 align:start position:0%
representative oregon you want to mute

00:57:34.789 --> 00:57:34.799 align:start position:0%

not to not that you would have been
 
00:57:41.910 --> 00:57:41.920 align:start position:0%
missing much if you couldn't so i'm
 
00:57:43.670 --> 00:57:43.680 align:start position:0%
president timothy horrigan i represent
 
00:57:45.430 --> 00:57:45.440 align:start position:0%
stratfor county district six the towns
 
00:57:47.190 --> 00:57:47.200 align:start position:0%
of durham and madbury
 
00:57:49.589 --> 00:57:49.599 align:start position:0%
and of course the durham is very uh
 
00:57:51.349 --> 00:57:51.359 align:start position:0%
durham is significant that's the home of
 
00:57:51.359 --> 00:57:51.990 align:start position:0%
durham is significant that's the home of
unh

00:57:51.990 --> 00:57:52.000 align:start position:0%
unh
 
00:57:54.309 --> 00:57:54.319 align:start position:0%
and first i'm gonna say i'm not sure if
 
00:57:54.319 --> 00:57:55.109 align:start position:0%
and first i'm gonna say i'm not sure if
i'm

00:57:55.109 --> 00:57:55.119 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
00:57:56.789 --> 00:57:56.799 align:start position:0%
going to before against the version of
 
00:57:58.470 --> 00:57:58.480 align:start position:0%
hp 1 and 2 which will come to the floor
 
00:57:59.750 --> 00:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
of the house it's on april 7th
 
00:58:01.109 --> 00:58:01.119 align:start position:0%
i'm sure it's going to be different than
 
00:58:02.789 --> 00:58:02.799 align:start position:0%
what the governor do so that's what i'm
 
00:58:04.470 --> 00:58:04.480 align:start position:0%
working off of
 
00:58:07.589 --> 00:58:07.599 align:start position:0%
i'm certainly opposed to that and um
 
00:58:09.030 --> 00:58:09.040 align:start position:0%
and also of course he introduced a few
 
00:58:10.789 --> 00:58:10.799 align:start position:0%
days late on march 2nd i'm not sure if
 
00:58:12.230 --> 00:58:12.240 align:start position:0%
the significance of this but we are
 
00:58:13.670 --> 00:58:13.680 align:start position:0%
behind schedule so
 
00:58:15.829 --> 00:58:15.839 align:start position:0%
the u.s first thing about where durham
 
00:58:16.990 --> 00:58:17.000 align:start position:0%
comes in
 
00:58:20.109 --> 00:58:20.119 align:start position:0%
usnhcc nh merger i know there's lots of
 
00:58:22.950 --> 00:58:22.960 align:start position:0%
advantages different that are supposedly
 
00:58:23.750 --> 00:58:23.760 align:start position:0%
to lead to
 
00:58:25.589 --> 00:58:25.599 align:start position:0%
those good things are already being done
 
00:58:27.109 --> 00:58:27.119 align:start position:0%
um even without the merger
 
00:58:29.589 --> 00:58:29.599 align:start position:0%
i think the experience the past shows
 
00:58:30.950 --> 00:58:30.960 align:start position:0%
that the merger is pointless and
 
00:58:33.670 --> 00:58:33.680 align:start position:0%
unnecessary um
 
00:58:35.910 --> 00:58:35.920 align:start position:0%
also probably more importantly there's a
 
00:58:37.670 --> 00:58:37.680 align:start position:0%
small business development center
 
00:58:39.349 --> 00:58:39.359 align:start position:0%
the governor proposed smashing its
 
00:58:40.950 --> 00:58:40.960 align:start position:0%
budget um that's
 
00:58:42.309 --> 00:58:42.319 align:start position:0%
probably the most productive money we
 
00:58:44.789 --> 00:58:44.799 align:start position:0%
spent um the tax cut rates
 
00:58:45.750 --> 00:58:45.760 align:start position:0%
pointless you're going to have no
 
00:58:47.510 --> 00:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
stimulus effect that's a fantasy that
 
00:58:48.069 --> 00:58:48.079 align:start position:0%
there's going to be
 
00:58:49.750 --> 00:58:49.760 align:start position:0%
credible economic growth the tax cut
 
00:58:51.270 --> 00:58:51.280 align:start position:0%
it's going to make no difference
 
00:58:52.950 --> 00:58:52.960 align:start position:0%
to anybody's spending or investment
 
00:58:54.549 --> 00:58:54.559 align:start position:0%
decisions none because they're just
 
00:58:58.150 --> 00:58:58.160 align:start position:0%
small tax cuts and reducing revenues
 
00:58:59.510 --> 00:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
not necessarily a good thing if it does
 
00:59:01.109 --> 00:59:01.119 align:start position:0%
reduce spending it's actually not bad
 
00:59:02.630 --> 00:59:02.640 align:start position:0%
for the economy and actually especially
 
00:59:03.910 --> 00:59:03.920 align:start position:0%
not when we do the things we're always
 
00:59:05.589 --> 00:59:05.599 align:start position:0%
making tough choices like
 
00:59:06.710 --> 00:59:06.720 align:start position:0%
you hear a lot about helping the
 
00:59:08.309 --> 00:59:08.319 align:start position:0%
vulnerable um that's actually good for
 
00:59:10.950 --> 00:59:10.960 align:start position:0%
the economy helping you vulnerable um
 
00:59:13.349 --> 00:59:13.359 align:start position:0%
so finally on a happier note the
 
00:59:14.630 --> 00:59:14.640 align:start position:0%
governor proposed it definitely
 
00:59:16.069 --> 00:59:16.079 align:start position:0%
enhancing the legislative branch's
 
00:59:16.789 --> 00:59:16.799 align:start position:0%
budget i
 
00:59:19.270 --> 00:59:19.280 align:start position:0%
i think that's long overdue we need a
 
00:59:20.630 --> 00:59:20.640 align:start position:0%
lot more resources to our
 
00:59:22.630 --> 00:59:22.640 align:start position:0%
job more staff more infrastructure more
 
00:59:23.750 --> 00:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
everything i know that's
 
00:59:25.910 --> 00:59:25.920 align:start position:0%
not fastable but we need to spend more
 
00:59:27.670 --> 00:59:27.680 align:start position:0%
than we've been spending and
 
00:59:29.109 --> 00:59:29.119 align:start position:0%
running the legislative branch from the
 
00:59:31.030 --> 00:59:31.040 align:start position:0%
cheap minimally staffed using automotive
 
00:59:32.789 --> 00:59:32.799 align:start position:0%
processing technology it didn't work
 
00:59:34.230 --> 00:59:34.240 align:start position:0%
pretty pandemic
 
00:59:35.910 --> 00:59:35.920 align:start position:0%
i thought we were pretty outmoded even
 
00:59:38.150 --> 00:59:38.160 align:start position:0%
when um i got here that was 12 years ago
 
00:59:39.910 --> 00:59:39.920 align:start position:0%
we made no changes
 
00:59:42.069 --> 00:59:42.079 align:start position:0%
one minute okay i thought zero minutes
 
00:59:44.069 --> 00:59:44.079 align:start position:0%
okay so running the legislative ranch
 
00:59:44.079 --> 00:59:44.630 align:start position:0%
okay so running the legislative ranch
minimally

00:59:44.630 --> 00:59:44.640 align:start position:0%
minimally
 
00:59:46.069 --> 00:59:46.079 align:start position:0%
staffed using outlet of processing
 
00:59:47.349 --> 00:59:47.359 align:start position:0%
technology it didn't work for the
 
00:59:48.549 --> 00:59:48.559 align:start position:0%
pandemic um
 
00:59:49.990 --> 00:59:50.000 align:start position:0%
it's not working during the pandemic
 
00:59:51.910 --> 00:59:51.920 align:start position:0%
although we we've made some good changes
 
00:59:53.030 --> 00:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
and you know we're
 
00:59:54.710 --> 00:59:54.720 align:start position:0%
we're still here we're still running and
 
00:59:57.430 --> 00:59:57.440 align:start position:0%
it won't work uh
 
01:00:00.470 --> 01:00:00.480 align:start position:0%
post pandemic so that's basically why
 
01:00:01.589 --> 01:00:01.599 align:start position:0%
basically i'm playing to vote against
 
01:00:03.670 --> 01:00:03.680 align:start position:0%

01:00:05.910 --> 01:00:05.920 align:start position:0%
to go to the senate there's also
 
01:00:07.990 --> 01:00:08.000 align:start position:0%
you may have to hold it over the summer
 
01:00:10.069 --> 01:00:10.079 align:start position:0%
and so but uh right now hb1
 
01:00:12.230 --> 01:00:12.240 align:start position:0%
hb2 as i understand that i'm i'm voting
 
01:00:13.750 --> 01:00:13.760 align:start position:0%
against it so
 
01:00:15.670 --> 01:00:15.680 align:start position:0%

consistently since april 2020 about one
 
01:01:38.470 --> 01:01:38.480 align:start position:0%
in every twenty households in new
 
01:01:39.670 --> 01:01:39.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire indicated
 
01:01:42.549 --> 01:01:42.559 align:start position:0%
there was either sometimes or not enough
 
01:01:42.559 --> 01:01:43.109 align:start position:0%
there was either sometimes or not enough
or

01:01:43.109 --> 01:01:43.119 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:01:45.349 --> 01:01:45.359 align:start position:0%
often not enough food to eat in the last
 
01:01:47.270 --> 01:01:47.280 align:start position:0%
several days
 
01:01:49.349 --> 01:01:49.359 align:start position:0%
new hampshire has a seventh highest per
 
01:01:51.030 --> 01:01:51.040 align:start position:0%
capita number of millionaires
 
01:01:52.630 --> 01:01:52.640 align:start position:0%
in the country and according to forbes
 
01:01:54.789 --> 01:01:54.799 align:start position:0%
magazine people in the highest income
 
01:01:56.470 --> 01:01:56.480 align:start position:0%
levels have seen their wealth increase
 
01:01:59.270 --> 01:01:59.280 align:start position:0%
by 1.3 trillion since
 
01:02:03.190 --> 01:02:03.200 align:start position:0%
march 2020 an increase of 44 percent
 
01:02:05.670 --> 01:02:05.680 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget proposes those
 
01:02:08.230 --> 01:02:08.240 align:start position:0%
least impacted by the pandemic
 
01:02:10.870 --> 01:02:10.880 align:start position:0%
of getting a tax break these are the two
 
01:02:12.230 --> 01:02:12.240 align:start position:0%
point four percent of new hampshire
 
01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:13.270 align:start position:0%
point four percent of new hampshire
taxpayers

01:02:13.270 --> 01:02:13.280 align:start position:0%
taxpayers
 
01:02:14.710 --> 01:02:14.720 align:start position:0%
will report at least two hundred
 
01:02:17.029 --> 01:02:17.039 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars in taxable interest
 
01:02:19.109 --> 01:02:19.119 align:start position:0%
dividend and distribution income
 
01:02:22.549 --> 01:02:22.559 align:start position:0%
i can assure you i am not one of them
 
01:02:24.630 --> 01:02:24.640 align:start position:0%
the budget proposes reducing the rate of
 
01:02:26.230 --> 01:02:26.240 align:start position:0%
and eventually eliminating the interest
 
01:02:28.309 --> 01:02:28.319 align:start position:0%
in dividends tax over five years
 
01:02:29.829 --> 01:02:29.839 align:start position:0%
and again giving a handout to the
 
01:02:31.750 --> 01:02:31.760 align:start position:0%
state's wealthiest households
 
01:02:35.190 --> 01:02:35.200 align:start position:0%
this tax revenue source generated 125.7
 
01:02:36.789 --> 01:02:36.799 align:start position:0%
million for the general fund
 
01:02:40.470 --> 01:02:40.480 align:start position:0%
in state fiscal year 2020 or 8.2 percent
 
01:02:42.470 --> 01:02:42.480 align:start position:0%
of all general fund revenue collected
 
01:02:44.950 --> 01:02:44.960 align:start position:0%
that year a repeal of the tax would lead
 
01:02:47.270 --> 01:02:47.280 align:start position:0%
to significant revenue losses
 
01:02:50.870 --> 01:02:50.880 align:start position:0%
relevant relative to current policy
 
01:02:52.309 --> 01:02:52.319 align:start position:0%
our economy is recovery from the
 
01:02:55.109 --> 01:02:55.119 align:start position:0%
pandemic and budget restructure
 
01:02:56.470 --> 01:02:56.480 align:start position:0%
reductions have been proposed the
 
01:02:58.309 --> 01:02:58.319 align:start position:0%
department of safety department of
 
01:03:00.630 --> 01:03:00.640 align:start position:0%
transportation department of education
 
01:03:02.309 --> 01:03:02.319 align:start position:0%
under fighting of child care services
 
01:03:03.750 --> 01:03:03.760 align:start position:0%
we've heard from other speakers
 
01:03:05.430 --> 01:03:05.440 align:start position:0%
by millions which could dramatically
 
01:03:06.870 --> 01:03:06.880 align:start position:0%
increase the wait list
 
01:03:09.109 --> 01:03:09.119 align:start position:0%
and discontinuation of over 40 million
 
01:03:10.789 --> 01:03:10.799 align:start position:0%
dollars in municipal aid funding
 
01:03:12.470 --> 01:03:12.480 align:start position:0%
in the 2020 budget which could lead to
 
01:03:14.390 --> 01:03:14.400 align:start position:0%
substantial property tax
 
01:03:16.549 --> 01:03:16.559 align:start position:0%
increases the priorities of this budget
 
01:03:18.230 --> 01:03:18.240 align:start position:0%
are misguided and should be amended by
 
01:03:19.349 --> 01:03:19.359 align:start position:0%
the legislature
 
01:03:20.950 --> 01:03:20.960 align:start position:0%
at a time when our nation and our state
 
01:03:22.470 --> 01:03:22.480 align:start position:0%
are moving towards recovery
 
01:03:23.990 --> 01:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
from the greatest economic downturn
 
01:03:25.589 --> 01:03:25.599 align:start position:0%
since the great depression when
 
01:03:26.950 --> 01:03:26.960 align:start position:0%
thousands of our neighbors are in the
 
01:03:28.470 --> 01:03:28.480 align:start position:0%
midst of economic peril
 
01:03:30.390 --> 01:03:30.400 align:start position:0%
giving the wealthiest among us a tax
 
01:03:33.109 --> 01:03:33.119 align:start position:0%
break does not pass the moral test
 
01:03:37.349 --> 01:03:37.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:41.190 --> 01:03:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:44.630 --> 01:03:44.640 align:start position:0%
next we have christine stoddard
 
01:03:46.549 --> 01:03:46.559 align:start position:0%
because i do not see mr barry's hand
 
01:03:47.990 --> 01:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
we've skipped him
 
01:03:49.829 --> 01:03:49.839 align:start position:0%
followed by laura gifford and doug
 
01:03:51.670 --> 01:03:51.680 align:start position:0%
mcnutt and if those two individuals
 
01:03:52.789 --> 01:03:52.799 align:start position:0%
could raise their hand
 
01:03:55.829 --> 01:03:55.839 align:start position:0%

01:04:11.589 --> 01:04:11.599 align:start position:0%
the state budget
 
01:04:13.430 --> 01:04:13.440 align:start position:0%
we did sign in as neutral and i will
 
01:04:15.430 --> 01:04:15.440 align:start position:0%
submit written testimony but i wanted to
 
01:04:17.349 --> 01:04:17.359 align:start position:0%
draw your attention to two issues that
 
01:04:20.150 --> 01:04:20.160 align:start position:0%
were raised last week in division three
 
01:04:22.150 --> 01:04:22.160 align:start position:0%
one of them was the state loan repayment
 
01:04:23.829 --> 01:04:23.839 align:start position:0%
program and the second issue that i
 
01:04:25.910 --> 01:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
wanted to discuss with you today is the
 
01:04:27.910 --> 01:04:27.920 align:start position:0%
family planning program
 
01:04:30.150 --> 01:04:30.160 align:start position:0%
bi-state is a non-profit organization

that's located in beau
 
01:04:34.150 --> 01:04:34.160 align:start position:0%
and we advocate for access to primary
 
01:04:35.750 --> 01:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
and preventive care
 
01:04:37.430 --> 01:04:37.440 align:start position:0%
for all new hampshire residents with a
 
01:04:39.109 --> 01:04:39.119 align:start position:0%
special emphasis on the medically
 
01:04:39.119 --> 01:04:39.990 align:start position:0%
special emphasis on the medically
underserved

01:04:39.990 --> 01:04:40.000 align:start position:0%
underserved
 
01:04:43.589 --> 01:04:43.599 align:start position:0%
we also represent new hampshire's 14
 
01:04:44.950 --> 01:04:44.960 align:start position:0%
community health centers which are
 
01:04:47.670 --> 01:04:47.680 align:start position:0%
located in medically underserved areas
 
01:04:50.150 --> 01:04:50.160 align:start position:0%
and those health centers provide
 
01:04:51.829 --> 01:04:51.839 align:start position:0%
integrated substance use disorder
 
01:04:53.349 --> 01:04:53.359 align:start position:0%
treatment behavioral health
 
01:04:56.470 --> 01:04:56.480 align:start position:0%
primary care and oral health services

patients one of five who
 
01:05:02.630 --> 01:05:02.640 align:start position:0%
are enrolled in the medicaid program
 
01:05:04.309 --> 01:05:04.319 align:start position:0%
last week in division three
 
01:05:07.029 --> 01:05:07.039 align:start position:0%
dhhs testified that there is a program
 
01:05:08.789 --> 01:05:08.799 align:start position:0%
within house bill 2
 
01:05:10.710 --> 01:05:10.720 align:start position:0%
that is intended to replace the state
 
01:05:12.549 --> 01:05:12.559 align:start position:0%
loan repayment program
 
01:05:14.150 --> 01:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
and we would ask that instead of
 
01:05:16.630 --> 01:05:16.640 align:start position:0%
replacing slurp as it's affectionately
 
01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:17.109 align:start position:0%
replacing slurp as it's affectionately
known

01:05:17.109 --> 01:05:17.119 align:start position:0%
known
 
01:05:19.069 --> 01:05:19.079 align:start position:0%
that these programs operate
 
01:05:19.079 --> 01:05:20.630 align:start position:0%
that these programs operate
simultaneously

01:05:20.630 --> 01:05:20.640 align:start position:0%
simultaneously
 
01:05:22.549 --> 01:05:22.559 align:start position:0%
they are designed to meet very different
 
01:05:23.670 --> 01:05:23.680 align:start position:0%
needs and
 
01:05:26.309 --> 01:05:26.319 align:start position:0%
serve very different purposes and it's
 
01:05:28.069 --> 01:05:28.079 align:start position:0%
my understanding that they were speaking
 
01:05:29.190 --> 01:05:29.200 align:start position:0%
to the
 
01:05:31.109 --> 01:05:31.119 align:start position:0%
workforce development debt relief
 
01:05:34.549 --> 01:05:34.559 align:start position:0%
program that begins on page 70.
 
01:05:36.390 --> 01:05:36.400 align:start position:0%
we would ask that the state loan
 
01:05:37.990 --> 01:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
repayment program continue
 
01:05:40.230 --> 01:05:40.240 align:start position:0%
as it is and as it was funded in the
 
01:05:42.710 --> 01:05:42.720 align:start position:0%
2019 budget which was at six and a half
 
01:05:44.470 --> 01:05:44.480 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
01:05:46.630 --> 01:05:46.640 align:start position:0%
um as you know this program provides
 
01:05:48.549 --> 01:05:48.559 align:start position:0%
partial payment towards educational
 
01:05:50.150 --> 01:05:50.160 align:start position:0%
loans of qualified health care
 
01:05:50.160 --> 01:05:51.589 align:start position:0%
loans of qualified health care
professionals

01:05:51.589 --> 01:05:51.599 align:start position:0%
professionals
 
01:05:53.349 --> 01:05:53.359 align:start position:0%
in exchange for working in medically
 
01:05:55.109 --> 01:05:55.119 align:start position:0%
underserved areas
 
01:05:56.710 --> 01:05:56.720 align:start position:0%
so we would ask that that program
 
01:05:59.109 --> 01:05:59.119 align:start position:0%
continue we also
 
01:06:01.910 --> 01:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
respectfully request that an additional
 
01:06:04.069 --> 01:06:04.079 align:start position:0%
1.2 million dollars be added to the
 
01:06:06.069 --> 01:06:06.079 align:start position:0%
family planning program
 
01:06:09.430 --> 01:06:09.440 align:start position:0%
because as many of you know there is a
 
01:06:11.589 --> 01:06:11.599 align:start position:0%
change at the federal level that affects
 
01:06:13.589 --> 01:06:13.599 align:start position:0%
who can participate in this program
 
01:06:15.750 --> 01:06:15.760 align:start position:0%
and participate in the federal funding
 
01:06:17.109 --> 01:06:17.119 align:start position:0%
for that program
 
01:06:19.829 --> 01:06:19.839 align:start position:0%
and we would like that the general funds
 
01:06:21.829 --> 01:06:21.839 align:start position:0%
be added so that there are no gaps in
 
01:06:24.710 --> 01:06:24.720 align:start position:0%
services in the family planning program
 
01:06:26.309 --> 01:06:26.319 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time and i am happy
 
01:06:33.589 --> 01:06:33.599 align:start position:0%

01:09:44.950 --> 01:09:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:47.990 --> 01:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
uh hi members of the committee my name
 
01:09:51.590 --> 01:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
is doug mcnutt can you hear me yes
 
01:09:54.229 --> 01:09:54.239 align:start position:0%
okay great um so i am the associate
 
01:09:56.630 --> 01:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
state director for advocacy for aarp new
 
01:09:58.669 --> 01:09:58.679 align:start position:0%
hampshire and we represent over
 
01:10:02.229 --> 01:10:02.239 align:start position:0%
215 000 members statewide
 
01:10:03.750 --> 01:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that is always
 
01:10:05.270 --> 01:10:05.280 align:start position:0%
clear about our members although they
 
01:10:07.189 --> 01:10:07.199 align:start position:0%
don't agree on everything
 
01:10:09.110 --> 01:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
over 90 percent of them believe that
 
01:10:10.790 --> 01:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
they want to stay at home as long as
 
01:10:11.590 --> 01:10:11.600 align:start position:0%
they can
 
01:10:15.110 --> 01:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
in their communities as they age and my
 
01:10:17.030 --> 01:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
focus today is really going to be on one
 
01:10:18.630 --> 01:10:18.640 align:start position:0%
issue and that is the choices for
 
01:10:20.390 --> 01:10:20.400 align:start position:0%
independence waiver
 
01:10:22.550 --> 01:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
which is the program that is designed
 
01:10:24.310 --> 01:10:24.320 align:start position:0%
for those who are eligible to be in a
 
01:10:25.830 --> 01:10:25.840 align:start position:0%
nursing home
 
01:10:28.870 --> 01:10:28.880 align:start position:0%
but uh can be taken care of at home
 
01:10:30.390 --> 01:10:30.400 align:start position:0%
and the reason it's important is it
 
01:10:32.149 --> 01:10:32.159 align:start position:0%
allows people to stay at home
 
01:10:34.950 --> 01:10:34.960 align:start position:0%
it is less expensive and as we've seen
 
01:10:37.270 --> 01:10:37.280 align:start position:0%
in this pandemic it is safer for people
 
01:10:38.950 --> 01:10:38.960 align:start position:0%
to stay at home
 
01:10:41.270 --> 01:10:41.280 align:start position:0%
one of the things that i would point out
 
01:10:42.709 --> 01:10:42.719 align:start position:0%
is there's a report that
 
01:10:44.390 --> 01:10:44.400 align:start position:0%
just has been released by the department
 
01:10:46.390 --> 01:10:46.400 align:start position:0%
of health and human services
 
01:10:49.110 --> 01:10:49.120 align:start position:0%
which shows that because of on your
 
01:10:50.229 --> 01:10:50.239 align:start position:0%
payments a lot of
 
01:10:52.310 --> 01:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
services that have been authorized for
 
01:10:54.310 --> 01:10:54.320 align:start position:0%
people to be taken care of at home can't
 
01:10:54.320 --> 01:10:54.630 align:start position:0%
people to be taken care of at home can't
be

01:10:54.630 --> 01:10:54.640 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:10:56.550 --> 01:10:56.560 align:start position:0%
filled and really that's part of the
 
01:10:57.990 --> 01:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
workforce crisis that
 
01:11:00.870 --> 01:11:00.880 align:start position:0%
has caused the difficulties that we have
 
01:11:03.270 --> 01:11:03.280 align:start position:0%
so i have submitted written testimony
 
01:11:05.830 --> 01:11:05.840 align:start position:0%
and i just would speak to you today and
 
01:11:08.149 --> 01:11:08.159 align:start position:0%
urge you to fully support
 
01:11:10.390 --> 01:11:10.400 align:start position:0%
uh increases in the choices for
 
01:11:12.229 --> 01:11:12.239 align:start position:0%
independence programs so that we can do
 
01:11:14.229 --> 01:11:14.239 align:start position:0%
a better job of taking care of our
 
01:11:16.550 --> 01:11:16.560 align:start position:0%

01:12:10.390 --> 01:12:10.400 align:start position:0%
responsibility to educate
 
01:12:12.390 --> 01:12:12.400 align:start position:0%
raise awareness and lead policy change
 
01:12:14.310 --> 01:12:14.320 align:start position:0%
related to health and well-being
 
01:12:16.470 --> 01:12:16.480 align:start position:0%
and in that vein this past summer new
 
01:12:18.070 --> 01:12:18.080 align:start position:0%
futures surveyed hundreds of new
 
01:12:19.350 --> 01:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
hampshire residents
 
01:12:21.350 --> 01:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
across the state to try to gain a better
 
01:12:23.510 --> 01:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
understanding of community needs during
 
01:12:25.510 --> 01:12:25.520 align:start position:0%
this unprecedented time
 
01:12:27.350 --> 01:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
and from this feedback we formed new
 
01:12:29.430 --> 01:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
features five-point plan for a healthy
 
01:12:31.990 --> 01:12:32.000 align:start position:0%
budget which we have provided copies of
 
01:12:34.149 --> 01:12:34.159 align:start position:0%
with more detail to the committee we
 
01:12:35.510 --> 01:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
believe that the five areas i'm just
 
01:12:35.990 --> 01:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
going to quickly
 
01:12:37.990 --> 01:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
run through um if fully funded in new
 
01:12:39.990 --> 01:12:40.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire state budget would go far to
 
01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:40.470 align:start position:0%
hampshire state budget would go far to
address

01:12:40.470 --> 01:12:40.480 align:start position:0%
address
 
01:12:42.470 --> 01:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
issues resulting from the covet 19
 
01:12:42.480 --> 01:12:44.070 align:start position:0%
issues resulting from the covet 19
pandemic

01:12:44.070 --> 01:12:44.080 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
01:12:46.229 --> 01:12:46.239 align:start position:0%
as well as overcoming health disparities
 
01:12:47.750 --> 01:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
for historically marginalized
 
01:12:50.149 --> 01:12:50.159 align:start position:0%
marginalized groups and new hampshire's
 
01:12:51.510 --> 01:12:51.520 align:start position:0%
children and families
 
01:12:53.270 --> 01:12:53.280 align:start position:0%
so quickly those five points are
 
01:12:55.189 --> 01:12:55.199 align:start position:0%
supporting local and public health
 
01:12:57.830 --> 01:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
programs and services ensuring access to
 
01:12:59.510 --> 01:12:59.520 align:start position:0%
health care by supporting a strong
 
01:13:01.189 --> 01:13:01.199 align:start position:0%
healthcare workforce
 
01:13:03.189 --> 01:13:03.199 align:start position:0%
supporting efforts to sustain and grow
 
01:13:04.790 --> 01:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
behavioral health services in our
 
01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:05.910 align:start position:0%
behavioral health services in our
communities

01:13:05.910 --> 01:13:05.920 align:start position:0%
communities
 
01:13:07.350 --> 01:13:07.360 align:start position:0%
sustaining investments that help
 
01:13:09.430 --> 01:13:09.440 align:start position:0%
mitigate and prevent childhood trauma
 
01:13:10.709 --> 01:13:10.719 align:start position:0%
to help grant state children and
 
01:13:12.870 --> 01:13:12.880 align:start position:0%
families and protecting children's
 
01:13:15.030 --> 01:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
behavioral health programs to ensure
 
01:13:16.870 --> 01:13:16.880 align:start position:0%
coordinated and timely care for new
 
01:13:18.470 --> 01:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire's youth
 
01:13:20.470 --> 01:13:20.480 align:start position:0%
the governor's proposed budget did cover
 
01:13:22.310 --> 01:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
numerous provisions in our five-point
 
01:13:24.070 --> 01:13:24.080 align:start position:0%
plan but there are a few areas we want
 
01:13:26.470 --> 01:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
to specifically call out
 
01:13:29.110 --> 01:13:29.120 align:start position:0%
for attention by the committee so the
 
01:13:29.120 --> 01:13:30.070 align:start position:0%
for attention by the committee so the
first

01:13:30.070 --> 01:13:30.080 align:start position:0%
first
 
01:13:31.590 --> 01:13:31.600 align:start position:0%
is something that christine daughter
 
01:13:33.270 --> 01:13:33.280 align:start position:0%
just mentioned
 
01:13:35.350 --> 01:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
from buy state primary care on the new
 
01:13:37.669 --> 01:13:37.679 align:start position:0%
hampshire state loan repayment program
 
01:13:40.310 --> 01:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
horrible acronym slurp but these funds
 
01:13:41.830 --> 01:13:41.840 align:start position:0%
do represent a critical
 
01:13:43.990 --> 01:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
investment to helping recruit and retain
 
01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:45.270 align:start position:0%
investment to helping recruit and retain
workers

01:13:45.270 --> 01:13:45.280 align:start position:0%
workers
 
01:13:46.950 --> 01:13:46.960 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire and we would encourage
 
01:13:49.669 --> 01:13:49.679 align:start position:0%
the committee to preserve those funds
 
01:13:51.669 --> 01:13:51.679 align:start position:0%
i also want to call out adolescent
 
01:13:53.990 --> 01:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
tobacco and sud prevention
 
01:13:56.310 --> 01:13:56.320 align:start position:0%
the dhhs tobacco prevention and
 
01:13:58.390 --> 01:13:58.400 align:start position:0%
cessation unit did request an additional
 
01:13:58.400 --> 01:13:59.350 align:start position:0%
cessation unit did request an additional
220

01:13:59.350 --> 01:13:59.360 align:start position:0%
220
 
01:14:02.310 --> 01:14:02.320 align:start position:0%
000 in a prioritized need we would
 
01:14:04.790 --> 01:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
encourage the committee to consider
 
01:14:07.270 --> 01:14:07.280 align:start position:0%
funding that request early childhood
 
01:14:08.390 --> 01:14:08.400 align:start position:0%
this is something that many people
 
01:14:10.550 --> 01:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
before us have also spoke about
 
01:14:13.110 --> 01:14:13.120 align:start position:0%
unfortunately 1.3 million dollars per
 
01:14:14.630 --> 01:14:14.640 align:start position:0%
year from the department of health and
 
01:14:16.149 --> 01:14:16.159 align:start position:0%
human service budget
 
01:14:18.149 --> 01:14:18.159 align:start position:0%
for primary prevention programming was
 
01:14:20.390 --> 01:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
cut we would like to see that restored
 
01:14:21.750 --> 01:14:21.760 align:start position:0%
it's something the governor also
 
01:14:23.750 --> 01:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
encouraged the committee to do um in his
 
01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:24.149 align:start position:0%
encouraged the committee to do um in his
march

01:14:24.149 --> 01:14:24.159 align:start position:0%
march
 
01:14:26.790 --> 01:14:26.800 align:start position:0%
4th letter and then finally new features
 
01:14:28.149 --> 01:14:28.159 align:start position:0%
would really be remiss if we did not
 
01:14:29.910 --> 01:14:29.920 align:start position:0%
clearly and unequivocally state our
 
01:14:31.030 --> 01:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
support for the governor's
 
01:14:32.950 --> 01:14:32.960 align:start position:0%
appropriations for children's behavioral
 
01:14:32.960 --> 01:14:33.590 align:start position:0%

01:14:33.590 --> 01:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
health
 
01:14:35.590 --> 01:14:35.600 align:start position:0%
on march 14th new hampshire set a really
 
01:14:37.510 --> 01:14:37.520 align:start position:0%
unfortunate record we had 51 kids
 
01:14:39.189 --> 01:14:39.199 align:start position:0%
boarding in hospital emergency rooms
 
01:14:40.870 --> 01:14:40.880 align:start position:0%
across the state
 
01:14:42.470 --> 01:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
and i should have mentioned that the
 
01:14:44.550 --> 01:14:44.560 align:start position:0%
children and families that are there
 
01:14:46.550 --> 01:14:46.560 align:start position:0%

hampshire
 
01:15:13.030 --> 01:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
at save the children action network we
 
01:15:14.709 --> 01:15:14.719 align:start position:0%
believe all children deserve access to
 
01:15:16.950 --> 01:15:16.960 align:start position:0%
high quality early childhood education
 
01:15:19.350 --> 01:15:19.360 align:start position:0%
since 2014 we have worked in partnership
 
01:15:20.950 --> 01:15:20.960 align:start position:0%
with community volunteers policy
 
01:15:22.550 --> 01:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
advocates and state legislators to

improve accessibility and quality of new
 
01:15:25.590 --> 01:15:25.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire's child care and early
 
01:15:26.790 --> 01:15:26.800 align:start position:0%
learning programs
 
01:15:29.030 --> 01:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
i'm here today to oppose cuts to
 
01:15:31.189 --> 01:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
employment related child care funding in
 
01:15:33.030 --> 01:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
house bill 1 which can be found
 
01:15:36.550 --> 01:15:36.560 align:start position:0%
on page 950 of your budget book
 
01:15:38.229 --> 01:15:38.239 align:start position:0%
employment related child care funds
 
01:15:39.669 --> 01:15:39.679 align:start position:0%
grant assistance to hard-working
 
01:15:41.270 --> 01:15:41.280 align:start position:0%
families with young children
 
01:15:42.950 --> 01:15:42.960 align:start position:0%
parents who are income eligible for this
 
01:15:44.950 --> 01:15:44.960 align:start position:0%
assistance benefit by having the ability
 
01:15:46.550 --> 01:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
to continue to work and earn
 
01:15:47.990 --> 01:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
a living while their children receive
 
01:15:49.990 --> 01:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
high quality care and education
 
01:15:51.669 --> 01:15:51.679 align:start position:0%
without this assistance new hampshire
 
01:15:53.110 --> 01:15:53.120 align:start position:0%
children will miss out on high quality
 
01:15:54.390 --> 01:15:54.400 align:start position:0%
foundational education
 
01:15:55.990 --> 01:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
and their parents are likely to miss out
 
01:15:57.669 --> 01:15:57.679 align:start position:0%
on earnings and or career advancement
 
01:15:59.669 --> 01:15:59.679 align:start position:0%
while staying home with kids
 
01:16:01.510 --> 01:16:01.520 align:start position:0%
employment related child care assistance
 
01:16:03.110 --> 01:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
is essential not only for child
 
01:16:04.950 --> 01:16:04.960 align:start position:0%
well-being but for working parents and
 
01:16:06.310 --> 01:16:06.320 align:start position:0%
their ability to earn
 
01:16:08.790 --> 01:16:08.800 align:start position:0%
money for basic costs of survival two
 
01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:09.750 align:start position:0%
money for basic costs of survival two
minutes

01:16:09.750 --> 01:16:09.760 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
01:16:11.510 --> 01:16:11.520 align:start position:0%
it is not unlikely for an income
 
01:16:13.270 --> 01:16:13.280 align:start position:0%
eligible family to wind up qualifying
 
01:16:14.870 --> 01:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
for increased state assistance
 
01:16:16.630 --> 01:16:16.640 align:start position:0%
when denied child care scholarship due
 
01:16:18.229 --> 01:16:18.239 align:start position:0%
to insufficient funds
 
01:16:20.149 --> 01:16:20.159 align:start position:0%
when considering the essential nature of
 
01:16:22.229 --> 01:16:22.239 align:start position:0%
these funds coupled with the impact kova
 
01:16:24.390 --> 01:16:24.400 align:start position:0%
19 has had on working families i cannot
 
01:16:25.750 --> 01:16:25.760 align:start position:0%
think of a worse time
 
01:16:27.750 --> 01:16:27.760 align:start position:0%
to make the proposed cuts to this
 
01:16:29.990 --> 01:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
funding while we cannot predict how many
 
01:16:31.110 --> 01:16:31.120 align:start position:0%
working parents will be
 
01:16:32.790 --> 01:16:32.800 align:start position:0%
income eligible for these scholarships
 
01:16:34.630 --> 01:16:34.640 align:start position:0%
in the coming fiscal year
 
01:16:37.110 --> 01:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
trends of pandemic related job loss and
 
01:16:37.120 --> 01:16:38.229 align:start position:0%
trends of pandemic related job loss and
unemployment

01:16:38.229 --> 01:16:38.239 align:start position:0%
unemployment
 
01:16:40.470 --> 01:16:40.480 align:start position:0%
suggest that more families will require
 
01:16:42.630 --> 01:16:42.640 align:start position:0%
child care assistance in coming years
 
01:16:44.550 --> 01:16:44.560 align:start position:0%
i urge you to prioritize these families
 
01:16:46.470 --> 01:16:46.480 align:start position:0%
and the efficiency of state dollars by
 
01:16:47.990 --> 01:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
providing at least level funding
 
01:16:49.510 --> 01:16:49.520 align:start position:0%
for employment related child care for
 
01:16:53.350 --> 01:16:53.360 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 2022-2023
 
01:16:55.110 --> 01:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
in conclusion i urge members of this
 
01:16:56.790 --> 01:16:56.800 align:start position:0%
committee to amend house bill 1 to
 
01:16:58.149 --> 01:16:58.159 align:start position:0%
include sufficient funding of
 
01:16:59.669 --> 01:16:59.679 align:start position:0%
employment-related child care
 
01:17:01.189 --> 01:17:01.199 align:start position:0%
it's a smart investment for the future
 
01:17:03.830 --> 01:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
of our state uh while we focus on covet
 
01:17:05.430 --> 01:17:05.440 align:start position:0%
19 recovery and beyond
 
01:17:06.790 --> 01:17:06.800 align:start position:0%
thanks for your time today and for
 
01:17:08.870 --> 01:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
letting me testify i'm happy to answer
 
01:17:10.630 --> 01:17:10.640 align:start position:0%

dunham
 
01:17:33.350 --> 01:17:33.360 align:start position:0%
good afternoon um i'm scott marion
 
01:17:35.270 --> 01:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
i live in ryan new hampshire i've been
 
01:17:36.709 --> 01:17:36.719 align:start position:0%
on this vermont school board i've been
 
01:17:38.790 --> 01:17:38.800 align:start position:0%
on the school board for eight years
 
01:17:42.830 --> 01:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
and i uh i'll be short i uh nice to see
 
01:17:42.840 --> 01:17:45.510 align:start position:0%
and i uh i'll be short i uh nice to see
representatives

01:17:45.510 --> 01:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
01:17:49.350 --> 01:17:49.360 align:start position:0%
um i just want to uh
 
01:17:52.310 --> 01:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
emphasize and i know that you guys
 
01:17:53.750 --> 01:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
between the rock and roll
 
01:17:56.830 --> 01:17:56.840 align:start position:0%
but i just want to emphasize uh the the
 
01:17:56.840 --> 01:17:58.310 align:start position:0%
but i just want to emphasize uh the the
downshifting

01:17:58.310 --> 01:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
downshifting
 
01:18:02.149 --> 01:18:02.159 align:start position:0%
that's in um governor's budget
 
01:18:04.550 --> 01:18:04.560 align:start position:0%
and uh that will likely have to carry
 
01:18:05.590 --> 01:18:05.600 align:start position:0%
through to
 
01:18:08.390 --> 01:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
this bill unless you protect it but just
 
01:18:10.950 --> 01:18:10.960 align:start position:0%
a very simple case now a little
 
01:18:13.110 --> 01:18:13.120 align:start position:0%
uh budget relatively little compared to
 
01:18:14.790 --> 01:18:14.800 align:start position:0%
earthquakes in the state
 
01:18:17.830 --> 01:18:17.840 align:start position:0%
but not so little to us um there was a
 
01:18:19.270 --> 01:18:19.280 align:start position:0%
significant increase
 
01:18:22.470 --> 01:18:22.480 align:start position:0%
last year in our share of
 
01:18:28.709 --> 01:18:28.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:31.669 --> 01:18:31.679 align:start position:0%
downshifted those costs to the locals
 
01:18:33.910 --> 01:18:33.920 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:18:36.630 --> 01:18:36.640 align:start position:0%
when you're trying to i need to balance
 
01:18:38.070 --> 01:18:38.080 align:start position:0%
these budgets and i know you're driven
 
01:18:39.189 --> 01:18:39.199 align:start position:0%
by revenue
 
01:18:42.950 --> 01:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
and negotiations with the governor
 
01:18:44.950 --> 01:18:44.960 align:start position:0%
but you have to recognize that the same
 
01:18:46.550 --> 01:18:46.560 align:start position:0%
people are paying
 
01:18:49.189 --> 01:18:49.199 align:start position:0%
whether you downshift into the towns and
 
01:18:50.790 --> 01:18:50.800 align:start position:0%
oftentimes it makes it worse when you
 
01:18:52.070 --> 01:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
downshift it to the towns
 
01:18:54.310 --> 01:18:54.320 align:start position:0%
than when the state takes responsibility
 
01:18:54.320 --> 01:18:55.189 align:start position:0%
than when the state takes responsibility
so

01:18:55.189 --> 01:18:55.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:18:57.270 --> 01:18:57.280 align:start position:0%
education funding is a mess of the state
 
01:18:58.229 --> 01:18:58.239 align:start position:0%
in general
 
01:19:01.350 --> 01:19:01.360 align:start position:0%
and so i urge you to consider the total
 
01:19:01.360 --> 01:19:02.470 align:start position:0%
and so i urge you to consider the total
cost

01:19:02.470 --> 01:19:02.480 align:start position:0%
cost
 
01:19:05.510 --> 01:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
to taxpayers not just the state tab
 
01:19:11.350 --> 01:19:11.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:14.709 --> 01:19:14.719 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony next we
 
01:19:14.719 --> 01:19:15.030 align:start position:0%

you are unmuted sir good afternoon
 
01:19:42.070 --> 01:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
chairman wyler and members of the house
 
01:19:43.669 --> 01:19:43.679 align:start position:0%
finance committee
 
01:19:46.390 --> 01:19:46.400 align:start position:0%
my name is roger derosier i'm the chair
 
01:19:48.830 --> 01:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
of the capital city task force for
 
01:19:51.990 --> 01:19:52.000 align:start position:0%
aarp and i'm from concord
 
01:19:54.470 --> 01:19:54.480 align:start position:0%
i'm a baby boomer in my 70s who is
 
01:19:56.149 --> 01:19:56.159 align:start position:0%
looking down the road
 
01:19:59.030 --> 01:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
at my possible future my possible future
 
01:19:59.669 --> 01:19:59.679 align:start position:0%
need for
 
01:20:02.709 --> 01:20:02.719 align:start position:0%
in-home services all of my friends and
 
01:20:04.709 --> 01:20:04.719 align:start position:0%
fellow aarp members
 
01:20:06.790 --> 01:20:06.800 align:start position:0%
share the same desire to remain in their
 
01:20:08.950 --> 01:20:08.960 align:start position:0%
home when possible
 
01:20:11.030 --> 01:20:11.040 align:start position:0%
it concerns me that the budget does not
 
01:20:12.470 --> 01:20:12.480 align:start position:0%
include a raise
 
01:20:15.430 --> 01:20:15.440 align:start position:0%
for all services in the state's choices
 
01:20:17.189 --> 01:20:17.199 align:start position:0%
for independence program
 
01:20:20.550 --> 01:20:20.560 align:start position:0%
cfi the services in this program
 
01:20:23.270 --> 01:20:23.280 align:start position:0%
as i understand them allows individuals
 
01:20:25.030 --> 01:20:25.040 align:start position:0%
to remain in their own home
 
01:20:27.750 --> 01:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
versus a nursing home certainly i would
 
01:20:29.910 --> 01:20:29.920 align:start position:0%
prefer to say in my own home that i have
 
01:20:31.189 --> 01:20:31.199 align:start position:0%
known for years
 
01:20:33.430 --> 01:20:33.440 align:start position:0%
and maintain my independence as long as
 
01:20:33.440 --> 01:20:34.870 align:start position:0%
and maintain my independence as long as
possible

01:20:34.870 --> 01:20:34.880 align:start position:0%
possible
 
01:20:36.870 --> 01:20:36.880 align:start position:0%
this can happen only if a comprehensive
 
01:20:39.110 --> 01:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
array of in-home services are available
 
01:20:41.030 --> 01:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
to residents in need
 
01:20:42.629 --> 01:20:42.639 align:start position:0%
two minutes the governor's proposed
 
01:20:44.709 --> 01:20:44.719 align:start position:0%
budget does provide
 
01:20:47.270 --> 01:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
some increases for some services to keep
 
01:20:48.709 --> 01:20:48.719 align:start position:0%
people at home
 
01:20:51.830 --> 01:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't go far enough the rate
 
01:20:52.709 --> 01:20:52.719 align:start position:0%
increases for
 
01:20:55.750 --> 01:20:55.760 align:start position:0%
some cfi services are not adequate
 
01:20:58.790 --> 01:20:58.800 align:start position:0%
to attract and expand the needed
 
01:21:02.390 --> 01:21:02.400 align:start position:0%
number of providers of these services
 
01:21:06.070 --> 01:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
other services such as adult medical day
 
01:21:06.080 --> 01:21:06.870 align:start position:0%
other services such as adult medical day
care

01:21:06.870 --> 01:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
care
 
01:21:09.669 --> 01:21:09.679 align:start position:0%
have not received an increase even when
 
01:21:12.149 --> 01:21:12.159 align:start position:0%
this service is currently reimbursed
 
01:21:15.590 --> 01:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
via medicaid at about half of the actual
 
01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:16.390 align:start position:0%
via medicaid at about half of the actual
cost

01:21:16.390 --> 01:21:16.400 align:start position:0%
cost
 
01:21:20.149 --> 01:21:20.159 align:start position:0%
of 112 dollars per day as a result
 
01:21:23.270 --> 01:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
many adult day care agencies have closed
 
01:21:25.189 --> 01:21:25.199 align:start position:0%
in the last five to 10 years
 
01:21:27.350 --> 01:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
cutting off services to medicaid and
 
01:21:28.390 --> 01:21:28.400 align:start position:0%
private pay
 
01:21:31.830 --> 01:21:31.840 align:start position:0%
individuals alike this is bad news for
 
01:21:32.669 --> 01:21:32.679 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's
 
01:21:36.950 --> 01:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
177 thousand unpaid family caregivers
 
01:21:40.070 --> 01:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
many of whom could would and did use
 
01:21:41.110 --> 01:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
this service
 
01:21:43.510 --> 01:21:43.520 align:start position:0%
for needed respite without burden
 
01:21:43.520 --> 01:21:44.470 align:start position:0%
for needed respite without burden
burgeoning

01:21:44.470 --> 01:21:44.480 align:start position:0%
burgeoning
 
01:21:47.510 --> 01:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
the state budgets now
 
01:21:50.149 --> 01:21:50.159 align:start position:0%
is the time to make budget increases for
 
01:21:51.510 --> 01:21:51.520 align:start position:0%
an array of adult
 
01:21:54.629 --> 01:21:54.639 align:start position:0%
in-home services as an alternative
 
01:21:57.669 --> 01:21:57.679 align:start position:0%
to much more expensive nursing home care
 
01:22:00.629 --> 01:22:00.639 align:start position:0%
as my generation ages the need for
 
01:22:02.149 --> 01:22:02.159 align:start position:0%
in-home services
 
01:22:06.470 --> 01:22:06.480 align:start position:0%
will increase geometrically by 2030
 
01:22:10.390 --> 01:22:10.400 align:start position:0%
all baby boomers will be 65 or older
 
01:22:13.750 --> 01:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
according to the u.s census baby boomers
 
01:22:15.430 --> 01:22:15.440 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire will make up about a
 
01:22:18.070 --> 01:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
quarter of its population
 
01:22:20.629 --> 01:22:20.639 align:start position:0%
so it's imperative to make in-home
 
01:22:22.709 --> 01:22:22.719 align:start position:0%
services available now
 
01:22:25.669 --> 01:22:25.679 align:start position:0%
and prepare for the future growth thank
 
01:22:28.550 --> 01:22:28.560 align:start position:0%

going on for over eight years
 
01:23:42.709 --> 01:23:42.719 align:start position:0%
hundreds perhaps thousands of granite

staters of all ages have faced
 
01:23:46.870 --> 01:23:46.880 align:start position:0%
this unacceptable delay in accessing

might be suicidal
 
01:24:13.270 --> 01:24:13.280 align:start position:0%

i get calls from people who know me and
 
01:24:41.189 --> 01:24:41.199 align:start position:0%

01:24:42.870 --> 01:24:42.880 align:start position:0%
how to direct them for help for a loved

how to direct them for help for a loved
one

01:24:44.310 --> 01:24:44.320 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:24:46.870 --> 01:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
faced with my son in crisis over 500
 
01:24:47.910 --> 01:24:47.920 align:start position:0%
miles away
 
01:24:50.629 --> 01:24:50.639 align:start position:0%
i was terrified one minute i have
 
01:24:52.550 --> 01:24:52.560 align:start position:0%
already sat at the bad side of a child
 
01:24:54.470 --> 01:24:54.480 align:start position:0%
after a suicide attempt in that moment
 
01:24:55.669 --> 01:24:55.679 align:start position:0%
when my second child
 
01:24:58.149 --> 01:24:58.159 align:start position:0%
i was on the phone i was afraid for his
 
01:25:00.870 --> 01:25:00.880 align:start position:0%
safety with him alone in the house
 
01:25:03.030 --> 01:25:03.040 align:start position:0%
but i was also afraid for his safety
 
01:25:04.550 --> 01:25:04.560 align:start position:0%
should he wind up boarding an emergency
 
01:25:06.629 --> 01:25:06.639 align:start position:0%
department without an advocate at hand
 
01:25:09.110 --> 01:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
he's sick sick not violent but highly
 
01:25:10.709 --> 01:25:10.719 align:start position:0%
sensitive and emotional
 
01:25:12.709 --> 01:25:12.719 align:start position:0%
he'd never had an inpatient psychiatric
 
01:25:12.719 --> 01:25:14.390 align:start position:0%
he'd never had an inpatient psychiatric
admission

01:25:14.390 --> 01:25:14.400 align:start position:0%
admission
 
01:25:17.110 --> 01:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
i feared that if he was stuck in an
 
01:25:18.709 --> 01:25:18.719 align:start position:0%
emergency department for days
 
01:25:20.790 --> 01:25:20.800 align:start position:0%
would he become upset would someone find
 
01:25:23.990 --> 01:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
him threatening because of his size
 
01:25:26.470 --> 01:25:26.480 align:start position:0%
in the hardest decision of my life i
 
01:25:27.830 --> 01:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
told him no
 
01:25:30.390 --> 01:25:30.400 align:start position:0%
do not go to the emergency department i
 
01:25:32.149 --> 01:25:32.159 align:start position:0%
was able to access family support for
 
01:25:33.990 --> 01:25:34.000 align:start position:0%
him and returned home the next day
 
01:25:35.910 --> 01:25:35.920 align:start position:0%
we successfully managed his crisis with
 
01:25:37.350 --> 01:25:37.360 align:start position:0%
his doctor
 
01:25:40.709 --> 01:25:40.719 align:start position:0%

really happy to pay taxes because he
 
01:26:52.390 --> 01:26:52.400 align:start position:0%

our town is better because sean lives
 
01:27:04.070 --> 01:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
here sean is also
 
01:27:06.149 --> 01:27:06.159 align:start position:0%
an enthusiastic consumer he makes sure
 
01:27:07.590 --> 01:27:07.600 align:start position:0%
that he spends some of his paycheck
 
01:27:08.550 --> 01:27:08.560 align:start position:0%

01:27:15.669 --> 01:27:15.679 align:start position:0%
so good that way too well sean is a
 
01:27:17.590 --> 01:27:17.600 align:start position:0%
happy fully participating member of our
 
01:27:17.600 --> 01:27:18.550 align:start position:0%
happy fully participating member of our
community

01:27:18.550 --> 01:27:18.560 align:start position:0%
community
 
01:27:20.310 --> 01:27:20.320 align:start position:0%
without the services he receives from
 
01:27:22.149 --> 01:27:22.159 align:start position:0%
gateway's community services which is
 
01:27:23.750 --> 01:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
our local area agency
 
01:27:26.390 --> 01:27:26.400 align:start position:0%
his quality of life would be in jeopardy
 
01:27:28.390 --> 01:27:28.400 align:start position:0%
john needs full-time one-on-one support
 
01:27:29.350 --> 01:27:29.360 align:start position:0%
and supervision
 
01:27:31.430 --> 01:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
my my husband and i provide that every
 
01:27:32.950 --> 01:27:32.960 align:start position:0%
morning evening overnight and on the
 
01:27:32.960 --> 01:27:33.910 align:start position:0%
morning evening overnight and on the
weekends

01:27:33.910 --> 01:27:33.920 align:start position:0%
weekends
 
01:27:35.430 --> 01:27:35.440 align:start position:0%
gateways provide shawn with direct
 
01:27:37.669 --> 01:27:37.679 align:start position:0%
supports on weekday hours and provide
 
01:27:39.270 --> 01:27:39.280 align:start position:0%
some respite so that my husband and i
 
01:27:40.709 --> 01:27:40.719 align:start position:0%
can sleep through the night every now
 
01:27:41.910 --> 01:27:41.920 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:27:44.709 --> 01:27:44.719 align:start position:0%
and get an occasional break we adore our
 
01:27:46.950 --> 01:27:46.960 align:start position:0%
son he makes our life joyful and it's
 
01:27:48.470 --> 01:27:48.480 align:start position:0%
never dull in our house
 
01:27:51.510 --> 01:27:51.520 align:start position:0%
but without the services we gateways
 
01:27:53.430 --> 01:27:53.440 align:start position:0%
we could not continue to support sean in
 
01:27:55.590 --> 01:27:55.600 align:start position:0%
our home and in his community activities
 
01:27:57.350 --> 01:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
which is a tremendous cost savings to
 
01:27:58.950 --> 01:27:58.960 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:28:00.790 --> 01:28:00.800 align:start position:0%
so as you consider the budget please
 
01:28:01.910 --> 01:28:01.920 align:start position:0%
include full funding for the
 
01:28:03.750 --> 01:28:03.760 align:start position:0%
developmental services budget
 
01:28:05.910 --> 01:28:05.920 align:start position:0%
my son my family and many others like us
 
01:28:07.270 --> 01:28:07.280 align:start position:0%
will thank you for it
 
01:28:09.830 --> 01:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
and if i could add one more thing i i
 
01:28:11.590 --> 01:28:11.600 align:start position:0%
had two more things one was the
 
01:28:13.669 --> 01:28:13.679 align:start position:0%
department of corrections educational
 
01:28:15.750 --> 01:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
programming so thank you for that
 
01:28:18.070 --> 01:28:18.080 align:start position:0%
but the other one is that i hope you
 
01:28:18.080 --> 01:28:19.110 align:start position:0%

proposed a very responsible budget which
 
01:29:17.270 --> 01:29:17.280 align:start position:0%

very strong
 
01:29:21.030 --> 01:29:21.040 align:start position:0%

funding and
 
01:31:44.149 --> 01:31:44.159 align:start position:0%
if possible increasing funding

for the choices for independence program
 
01:31:49.030 --> 01:31:49.040 align:start position:0%
not only does it serve
 
01:31:51.510 --> 01:31:51.520 align:start position:0%
those who are aging but it also serves
 
01:31:52.149 --> 01:31:52.159 align:start position:0%
many of us
 
01:31:54.229 --> 01:31:54.239 align:start position:0%

01:31:59.350 --> 01:31:59.360 align:start position:0%
like myself to get assistance with

activities of daily living and things
 
01:32:03.110 --> 01:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
that we're not physically able to do
 
01:32:03.120 --> 01:32:04.149 align:start position:0%
that we're not physically able to do
ourselves

01:32:04.149 --> 01:32:04.159 align:start position:0%
ourselves
 
01:32:07.030 --> 01:32:07.040 align:start position:0%
but that are required for us to you know
 
01:32:09.669 --> 01:32:09.679 align:start position:0%
live our lives like everybody else would
 
01:32:13.830 --> 01:32:13.840 align:start position:0%
i would also ask to

fully fund and increase funding if you
 
01:32:17.189 --> 01:32:17.199 align:start position:0%

those are not under the cfi waiver those
 
01:32:26.310 --> 01:32:26.320 align:start position:0%
are actually under the
 
01:32:29.189 --> 01:32:29.199 align:start position:0%
medicaid state plan services and those
 
01:32:29.199 --> 01:32:29.910 align:start position:0%
medicaid state plan services and those
are

01:32:29.910 --> 01:32:29.920 align:start position:0%

01:32:32.870 --> 01:32:32.880 align:start position:0%

who would otherwise be need to be in a
 
01:32:39.110 --> 01:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
nursing home
 
01:32:41.910 --> 01:32:41.920 align:start position:0%
and it basically provides services that
 
01:32:43.990 --> 01:32:44.000 align:start position:0%
they may get a nursing home
 
01:32:47.189 --> 01:32:47.199 align:start position:0%
in their own homes where
 
01:32:50.390 --> 01:32:50.400 align:start position:0%
generally a lot of us would prefer to be
 
01:32:53.590 --> 01:32:53.600 align:start position:0%

01:32:56.390 --> 01:32:56.400 align:start position:0%

01:33:17.510 --> 01:33:17.520 align:start position:0%
much for
 
01:33:20.550 --> 01:33:20.560 align:start position:0%
listening to me today i am a private
 
01:33:22.470 --> 01:33:22.480 align:start position:0%
citizen i'm not speaking on behalf of
 
01:33:24.790 --> 01:33:24.800 align:start position:0%
any particular organization i am now
 
01:33:24.800 --> 01:33:26.229 align:start position:0%
any particular organization i am now
retired

01:33:26.229 --> 01:33:26.239 align:start position:0%
retired
 
01:33:31.270 --> 01:33:31.280 align:start position:0%
um but i have always had paid sick leave
 
01:33:35.189 --> 01:33:35.199 align:start position:0%
in my jobs because i was a retired
 
01:33:36.870 --> 01:33:36.880 align:start position:0%
i'm now a retired teacher and i was
 
01:33:39.270 --> 01:33:39.280 align:start position:0%
fortunate in that respect
 
01:33:42.870 --> 01:33:42.880 align:start position:0%
but i would like to speak about
 
01:33:45.590 --> 01:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
the governor's paid family leave line
 
01:33:47.030 --> 01:33:47.040 align:start position:0%
item in the budget
 
01:33:49.430 --> 01:33:49.440 align:start position:0%
which i think simply maintains the
 
01:33:49.440 --> 01:33:50.070 align:start position:0%
which i think simply maintains the
status

01:33:50.070 --> 01:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
status
 
01:33:53.350 --> 01:33:53.360 align:start position:0%
quo it upholds the system where
 
01:33:55.990 --> 01:33:56.000 align:start position:0%
businesses who choose to provide leave
 
01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:56.470 align:start position:0%
businesses who choose to provide leave
time

01:33:56.470 --> 01:33:56.480 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:33:59.750 --> 01:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
sick care will do so and those who
 
01:34:03.350 --> 01:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
choose not to won't and i think
 
01:34:05.669 --> 01:34:05.679 align:start position:0%
this will cause small businesses to
 
01:34:07.590 --> 01:34:07.600 align:start position:0%
struggle against larger
 
01:34:10.070 --> 01:34:10.080 align:start position:0%
employers and i've been listening for
 
01:34:10.709 --> 01:34:10.719 align:start position:0%
the last
 
01:34:13.750 --> 01:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
almost hour and 40 minutes to many
 
01:34:15.990 --> 01:34:16.000 align:start position:0%

people speaking on a whole host of
issues

01:34:17.030 --> 01:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
issues
 
01:34:19.750 --> 01:34:19.760 align:start position:0%
about the importance of whether it's
 
01:34:19.760 --> 01:34:20.709 align:start position:0%
about the importance of whether it's
aarp

01:34:20.709 --> 01:34:20.719 align:start position:0%
aarp
 
01:34:22.470 --> 01:34:22.480 align:start position:0%
about providing the opportunity for
 
01:34:23.830 --> 01:34:23.840 align:start position:0%
people to stay at home
 
01:34:26.629 --> 01:34:26.639 align:start position:0%
or workers that provide services for
 
01:34:27.270 --> 01:34:27.280 align:start position:0%

01:34:31.030 --> 01:34:31.040 align:start position:0%
mental illness with developmental issues
 
01:34:34.070 --> 01:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
those workers those are the people who

those workers those are the people who
need

01:34:34.870 --> 01:34:34.880 align:start position:0%

01:34:38.310 --> 01:34:38.320 align:start position:0%
this family leave plan who need
 
01:34:41.270 --> 01:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
the supports that we can give them in
 
01:34:42.470 --> 01:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
the budget
 
01:34:45.510 --> 01:34:45.520 align:start position:0%
i feel strongly enough about this issue
 
01:34:47.990 --> 01:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
despite my privilege and because of my
 
01:34:50.390 --> 01:34:50.400 align:start position:0%
privilege to have had that benefit
 
01:34:52.709 --> 01:34:52.719 align:start position:0%
that i have attended hearings in both
 
01:34:53.430 --> 01:34:53.440 align:start position:0%
the house
 
01:34:56.310 --> 01:34:56.320 align:start position:0%
and the senate about the family leave

with life's overwhelming struggles and
also

01:50:08.470 --> 01:50:08.480 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:50:11.109 --> 01:50:11.119 align:start position:0%
invest in bipac black indigenous people
 
01:50:12.950 --> 01:50:12.960 align:start position:0%

they are the most impacted by injustice
 
01:50:17.270 --> 01:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
and that as a state we must write our
 
01:50:18.790 --> 01:50:18.800 align:start position:0%
wrongs and discontinue
 
01:50:21.430 --> 01:50:21.440 align:start position:0%

truth and reconciliation for black
 
01:50:25.109 --> 01:50:25.119 align:start position:0%
indigenous and immigrant communities is

a necessary first step
 
01:50:29.750 --> 01:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
um uh the next thing is invest in
 
01:50:31.669 --> 01:50:31.679 align:start position:0%
survivors by supporting social services
 
01:50:33.189 --> 01:50:33.199 align:start position:0%

survivors and last thing i'll say is i
 
01:50:36.870 --> 01:50:36.880 align:start position:0%
personally don't support
 
01:50:38.390 --> 01:50:38.400 align:start position:0%
any increase in the criminal justice and
 
01:50:40.709 --> 01:50:40.719 align:start position:0%

being made
 
01:50:46.790 --> 01:50:46.800 align:start position:0%
um in the criminal justice system in the
 
01:50:48.390 --> 01:50:48.400 align:start position:0%

jeffrey dickinson's comments in relation

to the choices for independence waiver
 
01:51:44.870 --> 01:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
we need to encourage provision of
 
01:51:47.030 --> 01:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
services at home and in community rather
 
01:51:49.589 --> 01:51:49.599 align:start position:0%
than in long-term care facilities there
 
01:51:50.950 --> 01:51:50.960 align:start position:0%
are many good considerations in the
 
01:51:52.550 --> 01:51:52.560 align:start position:0%
budget proposed by the governor
 
01:51:54.310 --> 01:51:54.320 align:start position:0%
i will take the moment to highlight just
 
01:51:55.669 --> 01:51:55.679 align:start position:0%
one missed opportunity that is
 
01:51:56.950 --> 01:51:56.960 align:start position:0%
critically important
 
01:51:58.950 --> 01:51:58.960 align:start position:0%
the bureau of elderly adult services
 
01:52:01.270 --> 01:52:01.280 align:start position:0%
options system modernization
 
01:52:03.350 --> 01:52:03.360 align:start position:0%
the current baas option system was
 
01:52:05.189 --> 01:52:05.199 align:start position:0%
developed in 1998 and initially
 
01:52:06.950 --> 01:52:06.960 align:start position:0%
installed in 1999
 
01:52:09.669 --> 01:52:09.679 align:start position:0%
which makes it a 23 year old system it
 
01:52:11.109 --> 01:52:11.119 align:start position:0%
is truly anachronistic
 
01:52:13.030 --> 01:52:13.040 align:start position:0%
and not suited to achieve the efficiency
 
01:52:15.510 --> 01:52:15.520 align:start position:0%
you need to realize in state government
 
01:52:17.990 --> 01:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
it is used to manage beas social work
 
01:52:20.390 --> 01:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
caseloads the adult protection program
 
01:52:22.229 --> 01:52:22.239 align:start position:0%
and service authorization and provider
 
01:52:24.070 --> 01:52:24.080 align:start position:0%
payments related to the social services
 
01:52:26.229 --> 01:52:26.239 align:start position:0%
block grant and the older americans
 
01:52:28.950 --> 01:52:28.960 align:start position:0%
act services the current system is not
 
01:52:30.790 --> 01:52:30.800 align:start position:0%
web-based and does not allow for remote
 
01:52:30.800 --> 01:52:31.510 align:start position:0%
web-based and does not allow for remote
access

01:52:31.510 --> 01:52:31.520 align:start position:0%
access
 
01:52:33.510 --> 01:52:33.520 align:start position:0%
offline access or any of the needed
 
01:52:35.510 --> 01:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
enhanced system functionality required
 
01:52:37.270 --> 01:52:37.280 align:start position:0%
for the variety of locations and user
 
01:52:38.950 --> 01:52:38.960 align:start position:0%
types that the beas
 
01:52:42.550 --> 01:52:42.560 align:start position:0%
business model currently utilizes beas
 
01:52:43.589 --> 01:52:43.599 align:start position:0%
social workers
 
01:52:45.270 --> 01:52:45.280 align:start position:0%
service link personnel and contract
 
01:52:47.350 --> 01:52:47.360 align:start position:0%
agencies now do significant field work
 
01:52:49.189 --> 01:52:49.199 align:start position:0%
realizing efficiencies that benefit both
 
01:52:50.790 --> 01:52:50.800 align:start position:0%
the residents of our state
 
01:52:53.510 --> 01:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
and the state budget bottom line covet
 
01:52:55.270 --> 01:52:55.280 align:start position:0%
has only highlighted the increased value
 
01:52:57.030 --> 01:52:57.040 align:start position:0%
of staff nimbleness to conduct remote
 
01:52:57.990 --> 01:52:58.000 align:start position:0%
meetings and to enter
 
01:53:00.790 --> 01:53:00.800 align:start position:0%
and access data remotely if this
 
01:53:02.229 --> 01:53:02.239 align:start position:0%
modernization project which was
 
01:53:04.149 --> 01:53:04.159 align:start position:0%
submitted as part of the capital request
 
01:53:05.990 --> 01:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
is not funded then the department
 
01:53:08.310 --> 01:53:08.320 align:start position:0%
will need to hire an additional 4.5
 
01:53:10.149 --> 01:53:10.159 align:start position:0%
full-time employees to maintain current
 
01:53:11.990 --> 01:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
work capacity
 
01:53:14.709 --> 01:53:14.719 align:start position:0%
in summary the the options system is 23
 
01:53:16.390 --> 01:53:16.400 align:start position:0%
year old is a 23 year old system that
 
01:53:18.310 --> 01:53:18.320 align:start position:0%
needs to be updated to help eas better
 
01:53:20.070 --> 01:53:20.080 align:start position:0%
manage va's social work
 
01:53:23.270 --> 01:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
or caseload without the upgrade improved
 
01:53:25.430 --> 01:53:25.440 align:start position:0%
business processes are not supported
 
01:53:26.629 --> 01:53:26.639 align:start position:0%
customer services
 
01:53:28.229 --> 01:53:28.239 align:start position:0%
could decline an additional personnel
 
01:53:29.510 --> 01:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
will be needed for data entry and
 
01:53:29.520 --> 01:53:30.790 align:start position:0%
will be needed for data entry and
manipulation

01:53:30.790 --> 01:53:30.800 align:start position:0%
manipulation
 
01:53:32.229 --> 01:53:32.239 align:start position:0%
if funded new hampshire will not have to
 
01:53:33.830 --> 01:53:33.840 align:start position:0%
bear the price tag of the modernization
 
01:53:34.950 --> 01:53:34.960 align:start position:0%

during this pandemic we need to

01:55:53.030 --> 01:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
programs for people in our community
 
01:55:54.629 --> 01:55:54.639 align:start position:0%
especially the mental health
 
01:55:57.669 --> 01:55:57.679 align:start position:0%
illness is some of the programs that we
 
01:55:57.679 --> 01:55:58.310 align:start position:0%
illness is some of the programs that we
need

01:55:58.310 --> 01:55:58.320 align:start position:0%
need
 
01:56:01.669 --> 01:56:01.679 align:start position:0%
to get more money and then we need to
 
01:56:04.149 --> 01:56:04.159 align:start position:0%
get more programs to our communities to
 
01:56:05.109 --> 01:56:05.119 align:start position:0%
be honest
 
01:56:07.669 --> 01:56:07.679 align:start position:0%
i see the struggles in my own community
 
01:56:08.229 --> 01:56:08.239 align:start position:0%
i see
 
01:56:10.470 --> 01:56:10.480 align:start position:0%
younger generations losing their life
 
01:56:12.470 --> 01:56:12.480 align:start position:0%

01:56:15.510 --> 01:56:15.520 align:start position:0%

myself

01:56:23.270 --> 01:56:23.280 align:start position:0%
myself
 
01:56:26.470 --> 01:56:26.480 align:start position:0%
and i i was part of
 
01:56:29.910 --> 01:56:29.920 align:start position:0%
part of the people who uh witness what
 
01:56:32.229 --> 01:56:32.239 align:start position:0%
happened in manchester with a a
 
01:56:35.589 --> 01:56:35.599 align:start position:0%
homeless community thank you
 
01:56:37.750 --> 01:56:37.760 align:start position:0%

going they're struggling with a homeless
 
01:56:40.950 --> 01:56:40.960 align:start position:0%
situation right now
 
01:56:43.589 --> 01:56:43.599 align:start position:0%
and uh this budget up is not going to
 
01:56:45.669 --> 01:56:45.679 align:start position:0%
help our community is going to make it
 
01:56:47.350 --> 01:56:47.360 align:start position:0%
harder for our communities especially
 
01:56:49.830 --> 01:56:49.840 align:start position:0%
the ones who have been loose on the jobs
 
01:56:52.709 --> 01:56:52.719 align:start position:0%
because of the pandemic we have to
 
01:56:54.310 --> 01:56:54.320 align:start position:0%
provide them with with a
 
01:56:55.990 --> 01:56:56.000 align:start position:0%
help necessary to make sure that we
 
01:56:57.430 --> 01:56:57.440 align:start position:0%
don't have any more people
 
01:56:59.830 --> 01:56:59.840 align:start position:0%
getting into the homeless situation and
 
01:57:01.990 --> 01:57:02.000 align:start position:0%

and i believe during this pandemic we
 
01:57:09.189 --> 01:57:09.199 align:start position:0%
see more cases of people
 
01:57:12.310 --> 01:57:12.320 align:start position:0%
especially people in our minority groups
 
01:57:14.470 --> 01:57:14.480 align:start position:0%
they're not getting the proper help we
 
01:57:16.550 --> 01:57:16.560 align:start position:0%
need to make sure that
 
01:57:18.950 --> 01:57:18.960 align:start position:0%
in this budget we get enough money to
 
01:57:20.070 --> 01:57:20.080 align:start position:0%

i am the director of the campaign for a
 
01:58:33.109 --> 01:58:33.119 align:start position:0%
family friendly economy we are working
 
01:58:33.990 --> 01:58:34.000 align:start position:0%
to help working
 
01:58:35.910 --> 01:58:35.920 align:start position:0%

obligations
 
01:58:41.189 --> 01:58:41.199 align:start position:0%
i want to address two items in the
 
01:58:42.149 --> 01:58:42.159 align:start position:0%
budget first
 
01:58:45.669 --> 01:58:45.679 align:start position:0%
hb1 inadequately funds and in fact makes
 
01:58:47.189 --> 01:58:47.199 align:start position:0%
significant cuts
 
01:58:49.109 --> 01:58:49.119 align:start position:0%
to the child care scholarship program
 
01:58:50.870 --> 01:58:50.880 align:start position:0%
that helps working families to afford
 
01:58:50.880 --> 01:58:51.270 align:start position:0%
that helps working families to afford
child

01:58:51.270 --> 01:58:51.280 align:start position:0%
child
 
01:58:54.470 --> 01:58:54.480 align:start position:0%
care second we are opposed to section
 
01:58:57.750 --> 01:58:57.760 align:start position:0%
69 to 74 of hb2
 
01:59:00.229 --> 01:59:00.239 align:start position:0%
related to paid family leave the
 
01:59:02.070 --> 01:59:02.080 align:start position:0%
pandemic has highlighted the financial
 
01:59:03.189 --> 01:59:03.199 align:start position:0%
insecurity that
 
01:59:05.189 --> 01:59:05.199 align:start position:0%
unexpected health threats and related
 
01:59:06.629 --> 01:59:06.639 align:start position:0%
time away from work
 
01:59:09.750 --> 01:59:09.760 align:start position:0%
can cause for working families right now
 
01:59:11.510 --> 01:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
more than two-thirds of working people
 
01:59:13.430 --> 01:59:13.440 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire lack access to paid
 
01:59:14.950 --> 01:59:14.960 align:start position:0%
family and medical leave
 
01:59:16.709 --> 01:59:16.719 align:start position:0%
and there is significant disparity
 
01:59:19.669 --> 01:59:19.679 align:start position:0%
between who has and who lacks paid leave
 
01:59:21.189 --> 01:59:21.199 align:start position:0%
women and people with caregiving
 
01:59:23.910 --> 01:59:23.920 align:start position:0%
responsibilities including families with
 
01:59:26.470 --> 01:59:26.480 align:start position:0%
a person experiencing disability
 
01:59:28.470 --> 01:59:28.480 align:start position:0%
are far less likely to have paid family
 
01:59:29.589 --> 01:59:29.599 align:start position:0%
and medical leave
 
01:59:31.430 --> 01:59:31.440 align:start position:0%
and these same working people are more
 
01:59:33.189 --> 01:59:33.199 align:start position:0%
likely to have a need for time away from
 
01:59:35.270 --> 01:59:35.280 align:start position:0%
work to meet caregiving needs
 
01:59:37.030 --> 01:59:37.040 align:start position:0%
low-income workers and families making
 
01:59:39.030 --> 01:59:39.040 align:start position:0%
less than sixty thousand per year
 
01:59:41.270 --> 01:59:41.280 align:start position:0%
are also less likely to have paid family
 
01:59:42.550 --> 01:59:42.560 align:start position:0%
and medical leave
 
01:59:45.030 --> 01:59:45.040 align:start position:0%
nothing in the sections of hb2 dealing
 
01:59:46.790 --> 01:59:46.800 align:start position:0%
with paid leave would relieve these
 
01:59:46.800 --> 01:59:48.709 align:start position:0%
with paid leave would relieve these
disparities

01:59:48.709 --> 01:59:48.719 align:start position:0%
disparities
 
01:59:51.109 --> 01:59:51.119 align:start position:0%
the proposal that is in hb2 is also
 
01:59:51.119 --> 01:59:51.750 align:start position:0%
the proposal that is in hb2 is also
unfunded

01:59:51.750 --> 01:59:51.760 align:start position:0%
unfunded
 
01:59:53.430 --> 01:59:53.440 align:start position:0%
there are no estimates of what the cost
 
01:59:55.109 --> 01:59:55.119 align:start position:0%
of the program will be to the general
 
01:59:55.119 --> 01:59:55.910 align:start position:0%
of the program will be to the general
fund

01:59:55.910 --> 01:59:55.920 align:start position:0%
fund
 
01:59:58.070 --> 01:59:58.080 align:start position:0%
today before division one the governor's
 
02:00:00.070 --> 02:00:00.080 align:start position:0%
office indicated there are no new funds
 
02:00:01.669 --> 02:00:01.679 align:start position:0%
included in hb1
 
02:00:03.430 --> 02:00:03.440 align:start position:0%
to cover the costs of state employee
 
02:00:05.589 --> 02:00:05.599 align:start position:0%
premiums which could be in the ballpark
 
02:00:08.229 --> 02:00:08.239 align:start position:0%
of 2.6 million dollars per year
 
02:00:10.310 --> 02:00:10.320 align:start position:0%
or staffing for the department of admin
 
02:00:13.109 --> 02:00:13.119 align:start position:0%
services or employment security
 
02:00:14.790 --> 02:00:14.800 align:start position:0%
when the language in these sections were
 
02:00:17.750 --> 02:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
in a standalone bill senate bill 730
 
02:00:20.390 --> 02:00:20.400 align:start position:0%
last year the fiscal note indicated that
 
02:00:22.310 --> 02:00:22.320 align:start position:0%
the costs associated with that language
 
02:00:23.990 --> 02:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
would be three million dollars to build
 
02:00:25.109 --> 02:00:25.119 align:start position:0%
the individual pool
 
02:00:28.870 --> 02:00:28.880 align:start position:0%
premium collection system and 1.7
 
02:00:30.790 --> 02:00:30.800 align:start position:0%
million annually for administration
 
02:00:32.709 --> 02:00:32.719 align:start position:0%
but those are not included in hb1 are
 
02:00:34.790 --> 02:00:34.800 align:start position:0%
detailed in hb2
 
02:00:36.229 --> 02:00:36.239 align:start position:0%
private businesses that choose to
 
02:00:37.750 --> 02:00:37.760 align:start position:0%
contract with a private insurance
 
02:00:39.430 --> 02:00:39.440 align:start position:0%
company would get a significant public
 
02:00:41.750 --> 02:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
benefit in the form of tax credits
 
02:00:45.270 --> 02:00:45.280 align:start position:0%
if uh this is not also not indicated in
 
02:00:46.310 --> 02:00:46.320 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
02:00:49.669 --> 02:00:49.679 align:start position:0%
if 50 of our employees were covered by
 
02:00:51.669 --> 02:00:51.679 align:start position:0%
businesses that chose that tax credit
 
02:00:54.790 --> 02:00:54.800 align:start position:0%
the cost to the bet could equal 29.29
 
02:00:56.629 --> 02:00:56.639 align:start position:0%
million dollars per year
 
02:00:58.550 --> 02:00:58.560 align:start position:0%
and that revenue loss is not indicated
 
02:01:01.030 --> 02:01:01.040 align:start position:0%
in the budget not including any of these
 
02:01:02.790 --> 02:01:02.800 align:start position:0%
costs or revenue implications for the
 
02:01:02.800 --> 02:01:03.510 align:start position:0%
costs or revenue implications for the
program

02:01:03.510 --> 02:01:03.520 align:start position:0%
program
 
02:01:04.950 --> 02:01:04.960 align:start position:0%
make it hard to believe there is any
 
02:01:06.550 --> 02:01:06.560 align:start position:0%
real commitment to seeing the sections
 
02:01:08.470 --> 02:01:08.480 align:start position:0%
of this bill realized
 
02:01:10.149 --> 02:01:10.159 align:start position:0%
there are also far too many policy
 
02:01:11.990 --> 02:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
implications that should have been dealt
 
02:01:13.589 --> 02:01:13.599 align:start position:0%
with in a policy committee
 
02:01:15.669 --> 02:01:15.679 align:start position:0%
including that this lacks any real
 
02:01:17.990 --> 02:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
protection for retaliation or job loss
 
02:01:19.430 --> 02:01:19.440 align:start position:0%
for individuals in the pool that would
 
02:01:21.270 --> 02:01:21.280 align:start position:0%
be administered by the state
 
02:01:24.149 --> 02:01:24.159 align:start position:0%
or for employers with under 20 employees
 
02:01:26.229 --> 02:01:26.239 align:start position:0%
there's no process for appeals of denied
 
02:01:26.239 --> 02:01:27.830 align:start position:0%
there's no process for appeals of denied
claims

we would also like you to support the

it's time to reverse pennywise and pound
foolish

02:02:46.070 --> 02:02:46.080 align:start position:0%
foolish
 
02:02:48.550 --> 02:02:48.560 align:start position:0%
health care policies which significantly
 
02:02:50.950 --> 02:02:50.960 align:start position:0%
contribute to people with disabilities
 
02:02:53.189 --> 02:02:53.199 align:start position:0%
experiencing the poorest health outcomes
 
02:02:55.189 --> 02:02:55.199 align:start position:0%
of any identified population
 
02:02:58.149 --> 02:02:58.159 align:start position:0%
in america as you have previously heard
 
02:02:59.669 --> 02:02:59.679 align:start position:0%
from abel
 
02:03:01.830 --> 02:03:01.840 align:start position:0%
in other years and other sessions the
 
02:03:04.149 --> 02:03:04.159 align:start position:0%
data is clear that people with poor oral
 
02:03:06.310 --> 02:03:06.320 align:start position:0%
health struggle to secure employment
 
02:03:09.189 --> 02:03:09.199 align:start position:0%
among the many consequences of poor oral
 
02:03:09.199 --> 02:03:09.910 align:start position:0%
among the many consequences of poor oral
health

02:03:09.910 --> 02:03:09.920 align:start position:0%
health
 
02:03:12.310 --> 02:03:12.320 align:start position:0%
people with disabilities already face
 
02:03:14.070 --> 02:03:14.080 align:start position:0%
discrimination from potential
 
02:03:15.589 --> 02:03:15.599 align:start position:0%
employers who believe the myth that
 
02:03:17.270 --> 02:03:17.280 align:start position:0%
people with disabilities are not quite
 
02:03:18.870 --> 02:03:18.880 align:start position:0%
worthwhile employees
 
02:03:20.470 --> 02:03:20.480 align:start position:0%
and as a population people with
 
02:03:22.070 --> 02:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
disabilities experience the highest
 
02:03:23.189 --> 02:03:23.199 align:start position:0%
rates of poverty of
 
02:03:25.750 --> 02:03:25.760 align:start position:0%
any identified group in part due to
 
02:03:27.109 --> 02:03:27.119 align:start position:0%
these kinds of myths
 
02:03:29.189 --> 02:03:29.199 align:start position:0%
so which kind of employer is going to
 
02:03:31.030 --> 02:03:31.040 align:start position:0%
hire a person with a disability whose
 
02:03:32.390 --> 02:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
mouth is full of decay
 
02:03:34.950 --> 02:03:34.960 align:start position:0%
and in periods of pain if new hampshire
 
02:03:36.470 --> 02:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
is interested in raising the rates of
 
02:03:37.510 --> 02:03:37.520 align:start position:0%
employment as well
 
02:03:39.350 --> 02:03:39.360 align:start position:0%
as improving health outcomes and
 
02:03:41.669 --> 02:03:41.679 align:start position:0%
lowering health care costs
 
02:03:43.750 --> 02:03:43.760 align:start position:0%
for people with disabilities and other
 
02:03:46.070 --> 02:03:46.080 align:start position:0%
vulnerable citizens on medicaid
 
02:03:49.030 --> 02:03:49.040 align:start position:0%
we must finally make providing fiscally
 
02:03:51.030 --> 02:03:51.040 align:start position:0%
sound and comprehensive oral health care
 
02:03:51.910 --> 02:03:51.920 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
02:03:55.270 --> 02:03:55.280 align:start position:0%
the law and we have to pay for it
 
02:04:00.229 --> 02:04:00.239 align:start position:0%
and in closing rsa rsa 171a
 
02:04:01.910 --> 02:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
mandates that the new hampshire
 
02:04:04.870 --> 02:04:04.880 align:start position:0%
legislature fully fund the adult

developmental disability service system
 
02:04:09.910 --> 02:04:09.920 align:start position:0%
people with disabilities must have the

to do

i am a consumer on mental health i have
 
02:17:23.270 --> 02:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
worked with
 
02:17:26.549 --> 02:17:26.559 align:start position:0%
nami new hampshire but i am a member of
 
02:17:27.349 --> 02:17:27.359 align:start position:0%
the general
 
02:17:30.629 --> 02:17:30.639 align:start position:0%
public i am completely worried
 
02:17:33.910 --> 02:17:33.920 align:start position:0%
i have seen what um governor sununu has
 
02:17:36.709 --> 02:17:36.719 align:start position:0%
proposed as far as mental health
 
02:17:39.750 --> 02:17:39.760 align:start position:0%
for the budget um i'm just concerned
 
02:17:42.150 --> 02:17:42.160 align:start position:0%
because of covid we had you know we were
 
02:17:44.790 --> 02:17:44.800 align:start position:0%
so prepared with a covid surge
 
02:17:48.070 --> 02:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
um that we turned nh to uh nhti's
 
02:17:52.629 --> 02:17:52.639 align:start position:0%
um gym for a like a covid surge
 
02:17:55.190 --> 02:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
area and what i'm wondering is if
 
02:17:57.190 --> 02:17:57.200 align:start position:0%
there's any way we can do that for
 
02:17:58.469 --> 02:17:58.479 align:start position:0%
mental health
 
02:18:01.030 --> 02:18:01.040 align:start position:0%
especially because there are 55 adults
 
02:18:01.669 --> 02:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
this is
 
02:18:04.389 --> 02:18:04.399 align:start position:0%
susan stearns mentioned as well as 22
 
02:18:04.399 --> 02:18:04.950 align:start position:0%
susan stearns mentioned as well as 22
children

02:18:04.950 --> 02:18:04.960 align:start position:0%
children
 
02:18:07.910 --> 02:18:07.920 align:start position:0%
waiting in er for a bed i don't know if
 
02:18:09.990 --> 02:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
you have a family member
 
02:18:14.150 --> 02:18:14.160 align:start position:0%
who has ever been at a hospital
 
02:18:16.870 --> 02:18:16.880 align:start position:0%
sitting in vr waiting for a bed and it
 
02:18:18.309 --> 02:18:18.319 align:start position:0%
is not fun i can tell you from
 
02:18:19.910 --> 02:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
experience you're along with your
 
02:18:20.709 --> 02:18:20.719 align:start position:0%
thoughts and
 
02:18:22.469 --> 02:18:22.479 align:start position:0%
thoughts aren't pretty if you're already
 
02:18:24.870 --> 02:18:24.880 align:start position:0%
at the hospital
 
02:18:28.389 --> 02:18:28.399 align:start position:0%
my other thought was since covid
 
02:18:30.549 --> 02:18:30.559 align:start position:0%
is i mean it's getting a little better
 
02:18:32.389 --> 02:18:32.399 align:start position:0%
here in the state but i was wondering if
 
02:18:34.309 --> 02:18:34.319 align:start position:0%
there was any way that we could
 
02:18:37.030 --> 02:18:37.040 align:start position:0%
try to identify a way to maybe put
 
02:18:38.469 --> 02:18:38.479 align:start position:0%
mental health
 
02:18:40.150 --> 02:18:40.160 align:start position:0%
i don't know what they're doing with the
 
02:18:41.669 --> 02:18:41.679 align:start position:0%
gym at nhgi
 
02:18:45.669 --> 02:18:45.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:47.429 --> 02:18:47.439 align:start position:0%
phase out some of the people that are
 
02:18:49.349 --> 02:18:49.359 align:start position:0%
stuck in the er right now
 
02:18:51.910 --> 02:18:51.920 align:start position:0%
um and maybe opening up the gym for them
 
02:18:53.750 --> 02:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
so that they have a place to talk about
 
02:18:54.790 --> 02:18:54.800 align:start position:0%
how they're feeling
 
02:18:59.030 --> 02:18:59.040 align:start position:0%
and maybe get that turnaround going um
 
02:19:01.830 --> 02:19:01.840 align:start position:0%
and then the other thing i've always
 
02:19:02.549 --> 02:19:02.559 align:start position:0%
said too
 
02:19:04.309 --> 02:19:04.319 align:start position:0%
we've been talking about this for so
 
02:19:07.110 --> 02:19:07.120 align:start position:0%
long the 10-year plan i would
 
02:19:09.349 --> 02:19:09.359 align:start position:0%
love to see that fully funded but more
 
02:19:09.359 --> 02:19:10.309 align:start position:0%
love to see that fully funded but more
importantly

02:19:10.309 --> 02:19:10.319 align:start position:0%
importantly
 
02:19:12.830 --> 02:19:12.840 align:start position:0%
medicaid reimbursement i can tell you in
 
02:19:12.840 --> 02:19:14.469 align:start position:0%
medicaid reimbursement i can tell you in
2019

02:19:14.469 --> 02:19:14.479 align:start position:0%
2019
 
02:19:17.509 --> 02:19:17.519 align:start position:0%
i had three of my mental health care
 
02:19:17.519 --> 02:19:18.830 align:start position:0%
i had three of my mental health care
providers

02:19:18.830 --> 02:19:18.840 align:start position:0%
providers
 
02:19:21.589 --> 02:19:21.599 align:start position:0%
retire and i know that that
 
02:19:25.910 --> 02:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
happened but it was all in the same year
 
02:19:28.870 --> 02:19:28.880 align:start position:0%
and it's very unnerving to have to start
 
02:19:28.880 --> 02:19:30.070 align:start position:0%
and it's very unnerving to have to start
over

02:19:30.070 --> 02:19:30.080 align:start position:0%
over
 
02:19:33.110 --> 02:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
with new doctors since then i've had to
 
02:19:35.830 --> 02:19:35.840 align:start position:0%
start with four new psychiatrists
 
02:19:38.790 --> 02:19:38.800 align:start position:0%
and it is never easy and you think
 
02:19:39.429 --> 02:19:39.439 align:start position:0%
you've got
 
02:19:41.750 --> 02:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
one and then oh look i'm leaving i'm
 
02:19:42.870 --> 02:19:42.880 align:start position:0%
going here
 
02:19:45.509 --> 02:19:45.519 align:start position:0%
oh look well i had to move out of state
 
02:19:46.469 --> 02:19:46.479 align:start position:0%
my family
 
02:19:48.870 --> 02:19:48.880 align:start position:0%
had to go somewhere else and the latest
 
02:19:48.880 --> 02:19:49.590 align:start position:0%
had to go somewhere else and the latest
one

02:19:49.590 --> 02:19:49.600 align:start position:0%
one
 
02:19:52.150 --> 02:19:52.160 align:start position:0%
accused me of not taking my meds and i
 
02:19:53.510 --> 02:19:53.520 align:start position:0%

one of the things that are people um
 
02:21:14.790 --> 02:21:14.800 align:start position:0%

um last weekend i was in the emergency
 
02:21:17.840 --> 02:21:18.630 align:start position:0%
um last weekend i was in the emergency
room

02:21:18.630 --> 02:21:18.640 align:start position:0%
room
 
02:21:21.510 --> 02:21:21.520 align:start position:0%
and i went witness people with mental
 
02:21:21.520 --> 02:21:22.630 align:start position:0%
and i went witness people with mental
illness

02:21:22.630 --> 02:21:22.640 align:start position:0%
illness
 
02:21:25.990 --> 02:21:26.000 align:start position:0%
needing help and then the hospital
 
02:21:29.429 --> 02:21:29.439 align:start position:0%
didn't have a place for people to to get
 
02:21:29.439 --> 02:21:29.990 align:start position:0%
didn't have a place for people to to get
the

02:21:29.990 --> 02:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:21:34.550 --> 02:21:34.560 align:start position:0%
that um needed a treatment from menthol
 
02:21:38.469 --> 02:21:38.479 align:start position:0%
so i will i will ask all of you to
 
02:21:42.150 --> 02:21:42.160 align:start position:0%
think about ways that we can uh provide
 
02:21:44.389 --> 02:21:44.399 align:start position:0%
more i know that probably we don't have
 
02:21:46.469 --> 02:21:46.479 align:start position:0%
enough people we don't have that uh
 
02:21:48.389 --> 02:21:48.399 align:start position:0%
the room necessary in our hospital but
 
02:21:50.150 --> 02:21:50.160 align:start position:0%
we have to figure it out
 
02:21:52.309 --> 02:21:52.319 align:start position:0%
because we're losing a lot of lives in
 
02:21:54.309 --> 02:21:54.319 align:start position:0%
our communities especially during the
 
02:21:54.319 --> 02:21:55.030 align:start position:0%
our communities especially during the
pandemic

02:21:55.030 --> 02:21:55.040 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
02:21:57.349 --> 02:21:57.359 align:start position:0%
we see more people struggling in mental
 
02:21:58.550 --> 02:21:58.560 align:start position:0%
health illness
 
02:22:01.270 --> 02:22:01.280 align:start position:0%
it's huge we don't we don't think that
 
02:22:03.030 --> 02:22:03.040 align:start position:0%
it is a big deal but it is
 
02:22:06.070 --> 02:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
and and and i believe that we have we
 
02:22:08.230 --> 02:22:08.240 align:start position:0%
have the potential to save more lives
 
02:22:09.990 --> 02:22:10.000 align:start position:0%
but we have to be open to
 
02:22:13.349 --> 02:22:13.359 align:start position:0%
listen to to the struggle that hospitals
 
02:22:14.870 --> 02:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
and people in our community are going
 
02:22:15.750 --> 02:22:15.760 align:start position:0%
through right now
 
02:22:19.110 --> 02:22:19.120 align:start position:0%

increase in mental illness
 
02:22:32.870 --> 02:22:32.880 align:start position:0%

last fiscal year
 
02:22:36.550 --> 02:22:36.560 align:start position:0%
