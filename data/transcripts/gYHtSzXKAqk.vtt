that one as
 
00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:24.800 align:start position:0%

well so
 
00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:41.880 align:start position:0%
representative representative Schmidt

Professional
 
00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:58.680 align:start position:0%
Engineers f and g which are the
 
00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:00.479 align:start position:0%
department of energy
 
00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:02.960 align:start position:0%
and K which is the board of dental
 
00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:04.680 align:start position:0%
examiners thank
 
00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:07.120 align:start position:0%
you I'll second the
 
00:06:10.029 --> 00:06:10.039 align:start position:0%
postponement okay I
 
00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
believe any
 
00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:15.680 align:start position:0%
discussion all right seeing none those
 
00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:19.120 align:start position:0%
in favor I I
 
00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:23.000 align:start position:0%
opposed then that leaves us to deal with
 
00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:25.120 align:start position:0%
the department of safety items B and
 
00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:28.680 align:start position:0%
then C okay um so the first item which
 
00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:30.680 align:start position:0%
is 202 23
 
00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
163 um has to do with non-resident
 
00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:37.000 align:start position:0%
pistol revolver license I did have a
 
00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:39.280 align:start position:0%
couple substantial comments on this
 
00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:41.240 align:start position:0%
however I did also have a conversation
 
00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:43.160 align:start position:0%
with the Department yesterday that
 
00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:46.520 align:start position:0%
clarified some of these comments um so
 
00:06:48.909 --> 00:06:48.919 align:start position:0%
for example the first one on page one of
 
00:06:50.749 --> 00:06:50.759 align:start position:0%
the rule text I had a legislative
 
00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:53.960 align:start position:0%
unclear comment because the agency had
 
00:06:57.790 --> 00:06:57.800 align:start position:0%
deleted the paragraph applicability from
 
00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:00.840 align:start position:0%
the final proposal text text and it was
 
00:07:02.589 --> 00:07:02.599 align:start position:0%
unclear why they did that especially
 
00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:05.680 align:start position:0%
because it talked about the exemption in
 
00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:07.029 align:start position:0%
because it talked about the exemption in
RSA

00:07:07.029 --> 00:07:07.039 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
00:07:07.039 --> 00:07:08.550 align:start position:0%
RSA
159

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:08.560 align:start position:0%
159
 
00:07:12.629 --> 00:07:12.639 align:start position:0%
6D um for non-residents in reciprocal
 
00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:14.360 align:start position:0%
states but when I talked to the
 
00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:16.440 align:start position:0%
department they clarified that this was
 
00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:18.280 align:start position:0%
done due to some public comment that
 
00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
they had received and additionally when
 
00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:23.840 align:start position:0%
you look at the purpose section it makes
 
00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:27.400 align:start position:0%
uh it clear that this application is is
 
00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:29.560 align:start position:0%
really optional so the purpose itself
 
00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:32.240 align:start position:0%
for non-residents who wish to obtain not
 
00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:34.960 align:start position:0%
that they have to obtain So based on
 
00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:36.840 align:start position:0%
that language and the fact that this was
 
00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:38.440 align:start position:0%
based on some public comment they
 
00:07:40.909 --> 00:07:40.919 align:start position:0%
received um I would say that addresses
 
00:07:40.919 --> 00:07:41.749 align:start position:0%
received um I would say that addresses
that

00:07:41.749 --> 00:07:41.759 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:45.080 align:start position:0%
comment the next comment was on page two
 
00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:48.280 align:start position:0%
it's an unclear comment um this has to
 
00:07:51.029 --> 00:07:51.039 align:start position:0%
do with the written notice the
 
00:07:52.589 --> 00:07:52.599 align:start position:0%
Department is supposed to provide a
 
00:07:54.909 --> 00:07:54.919 align:start position:0%
lensey when they suspend or revoke a
 
00:07:57.469 --> 00:07:57.479 align:start position:0%
rule uh it's required by Statute that
 
00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:01.080 align:start position:0%
they provide that uh under our RSA 159
 
00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:04.440 align:start position:0%
6B but in the sections for revocation
 
00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:06.400 align:start position:0%
and suspension they did not mention
 
00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:09.240 align:start position:0%
anything about notice uh when I talked
 
00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:11.400 align:start position:0%
to the department they said that the
 
00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:15.720 align:start position:0%
notice is provided as is required by 541
 
00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
a30 and my recommendation is that they
 
00:08:21.469 --> 00:08:21.479 align:start position:0%
include that somewhere in the rules so
 
00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:23.400 align:start position:0%
that someone who's looking at them knows
 
00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
to look to RSA 541 a30 to know that they
 
00:08:29.909 --> 00:08:29.919 align:start position:0%
will receive notice
 
00:08:32.949 --> 00:08:32.959 align:start position:0%
um and that they will receive notice if
 
00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:35.360 align:start position:0%
it's an emergency
 
00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:37.800 align:start position:0%
revocation um that they're entitled to a
 
00:08:39.509 --> 00:08:39.519 align:start position:0%
hearing within 10
 
00:08:42.709 --> 00:08:42.719 align:start position:0%
days the next comment I had is also on
 
00:08:44.509 --> 00:08:44.519 align:start position:0%
page two it's an unclear legislative
 
00:08:44.519 --> 00:08:45.550 align:start position:0%
page two it's an unclear legislative
intent

00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:45.560 align:start position:0%
intent
 
00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:48.240 align:start position:0%
comment um the statute specifically
 
00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:50.600 align:start position:0%
allows a license to remain in effect
 
00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
until it expires when a license C uh
 
00:08:57.829 --> 00:08:57.839 align:start position:0%
ceases to be a resident of the community
 
00:08:59.829 --> 00:08:59.839 align:start position:0%
in which the license C was
 
00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:02.920 align:start position:0%
the license was issued after notifying
 
00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:05.200 align:start position:0%
the issuing authority of the lenes new
 
00:09:06.269 --> 00:09:06.279 align:start position:0%
place of
 
00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:08.920 align:start position:0%
residence um however the rule text says
 
00:09:11.069 --> 00:09:11.079 align:start position:0%
that once a lensey moves to New
 
00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:13.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire their license is automatically
 
00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:16.480 align:start position:0%
revoked so the legislative intent for
 
00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:18.800 align:start position:0%
that statute is a bit unclear when it
 
00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:21.160 align:start position:0%
comes to non-residents whether that is
 
00:09:23.269 --> 00:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
an automatic revocation or if the
 
00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:26.240 align:start position:0%
license would continue as long as that
 
00:09:28.389 --> 00:09:28.399 align:start position:0%
non-resident gave notice to the
 
00:09:28.399 --> 00:09:30.710 align:start position:0%
non-resident gave notice to the
Department

00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:30.720 align:start position:0%
Department
 
00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:33.480 align:start position:0%
and the final comment I had is at the
 
00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
bottom of page two with regard to the um
 
00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:41.480 align:start position:0%
venue for non-residents should they wish
 
00:09:43.509 --> 00:09:43.519 align:start position:0%
to appeal a revocation or suspension of
 
00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:46.360 align:start position:0%
their license the rule text says
 
00:09:49.509 --> 00:09:49.519 align:start position:0%
specifically that the venue would be the
 
00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:52.360 align:start position:0%
conquered District Court which does have
 
00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:54.760 align:start position:0%
personal jurisdiction over the
 
00:09:58.710 --> 00:09:58.720 align:start position:0%
department um however the statute
 
00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:01.200 align:start position:0%
specific specifically says that a person
 
00:10:03.269 --> 00:10:03.279 align:start position:0%
must petition the district or M
 
00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
Municipal Court in the jurisdiction in
 
00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:08.120 align:start position:0%
which such person resides so there is
 
00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
just a little bit of some unclear
 
00:10:15.509 --> 00:10:15.519 align:start position:0%
legislative intent there says person not
 
00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:19.160 align:start position:0%
resident and you know as I'm sure uh
 
00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:20.920 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn is aware personal
 
00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:23.200 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over state agencies um you
 
00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:25.160 align:start position:0%
can't really sue them outside of their
 
00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:27.640 align:start position:0%
own state court so just might need a
 
00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:29.640 align:start position:0%
little clarification on that point
 
00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:30.880 align:start position:0%
but that's all the comments I had on
 
00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:32.069 align:start position:0%
but that's all the comments I had on
this

00:10:32.069 --> 00:10:32.079 align:start position:0%

representing the department of safety I
 
00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:54.680 align:start position:0%
have Lieutenant U Mary Bia from the
 
00:10:57.629 --> 00:10:57.639 align:start position:0%
division of State Police with me as well
 
00:11:01.509 --> 00:11:01.519 align:start position:0%

she pretty much represented um our
 
00:11:12.069 --> 00:11:12.079 align:start position:0%
position here we do conform with RSA 541
 
00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:15.320 align:start position:0%
a30 for any um suspensions or and
 
00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:17.320 align:start position:0%
notices of revocation we think the
 
00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
statute is very clear of what is
 
00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:21.680 align:start position:0%
required of the agency before taking any
 
00:11:27.949 --> 00:11:27.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:31.949 --> 00:11:31.959 align:start position:0%
24.02 um with regards to when a li a
 
00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
non-resident pistol permit that we've
 
00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:37.000 align:start position:0%
issued pursuant to statute and rules
 
00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:40.880 align:start position:0%
once the um leny becomes a resident we
 
00:11:43.509 --> 00:11:43.519 align:start position:0%
believe that they're required by Statute
 
00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
to go to the chief of police and get
 
00:11:49.389 --> 00:11:49.399 align:start position:0%
their resident concealed carry from that
 
00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:53.560 align:start position:0%
um that town um and
 
00:11:56.110 --> 00:11:56.120 align:start position:0%
so and then of course the last one we
 
00:11:58.910 --> 00:11:58.920 align:start position:0%
just don't agree that we can submit to
 
00:12:04.269 --> 00:12:04.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:09.870 align:start position:0%
 
questions

00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:09.880 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:12.200 align:start position:0%
Senator we have some public comment

please
 
00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:32.189 align:start position:0%
please
sorry

00:12:32.189 --> 00:12:32.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:34.120 align:start position:0%
certainly that's exactly what I intended
 
00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:35.310 align:start position:0%
certainly that's exactly what I intended
to

00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:35.320 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:12:38.629 --> 00:12:38.639 align:start position:0%
do what I see here at least the rule I
 
00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:39.880 align:start position:0%
have that's
 
00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:42.760 align:start position:0%
published that was published um by jel
 
00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
car on the website has a several
 
00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:48.920 align:start position:0%
problems um first of
 
00:12:54.110 --> 00:12:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:56.509 align:start position:0%
 
2104

00:12:56.509 --> 00:12:56.519 align:start position:0%
2104
 
00:12:59.550 --> 00:12:59.560 align:start position:0%
.01 um the lensey is under indictment
 
00:13:01.629 --> 00:13:01.639 align:start position:0%
for a crime punishable by imprisonment
 
00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:04.720 align:start position:0%
for a term exceeding one
 
00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:07.800 align:start position:0%
year that's something new that's not
 
00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:09.560 align:start position:0%
what federal law actually provides they
 
00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:11.320 align:start position:0%
provide you can't purchase anymore but
 
00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:13.560 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say anymore about possession
 
00:13:15.069 --> 00:13:15.079 align:start position:0%
or anything else so what they're doing
 
00:13:17.389 --> 00:13:17.399 align:start position:0%
is adding to the law
 
00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:20.120 align:start position:0%
now okay that's a that's a very clear
 
00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:22.440 align:start position:0%
statement M miglani do you wish to
 
00:13:25.069 --> 00:13:25.079 align:start position:0%
address that I was going to continue
 
00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:27.880 align:start position:0%
ma'am sorry just because I think that
 
00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:29.480 align:start position:0%
here's what someone is going to say next
 
00:13:32.389 --> 00:13:32.399 align:start position:0%
so I want to address all of those things
 
00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:34.880 align:start position:0%
uh as a please wait till she actually
 
00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:38.320 align:start position:0%
says it if that's okay no well I will
 
00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:40.040 align:start position:0%
wait but I think it would be helpful to
 
00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:42.920 align:start position:0%
the committee to hear the rest of it
 
00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:46.040 align:start position:0%
but m m Leana do you have any response
 
00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:50.910 align:start position:0%
but m m Leana do you have any response
to

00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:50.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:55.320 align:start position:0%
that okay then then please continue yes
 
00:13:57.870 --> 00:13:57.880 align:start position:0%
as a practical matter I understand that
 
00:13:59.389 --> 00:13:59.399 align:start position:0%
some judges
 
00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:01.360 align:start position:0%
will make a condition of bail that you
 
00:14:03.069 --> 00:14:03.079 align:start position:0%
not be allowed to have firearms in many
 
00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
instances but not all instances I've had
 
00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:08.040 align:start position:0%
clients indicted for felonies including
 
00:14:10.509 --> 00:14:10.519 align:start position:0%
felony of allegedly pointing a firearm
 
00:14:12.269 --> 00:14:12.279 align:start position:0%
at someone where the police promptly
 
00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:14.120 align:start position:0%
returned their firearms and the court
 
00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:15.880 align:start position:0%
did not make as a condition of their
 
00:14:17.949 --> 00:14:17.959 align:start position:0%
bail that they couldn't have firearms
 
00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:20.480 align:start position:0%
and and the low normal things which is
 
00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
Edge weapons and they go down the
 
00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:24.720 align:start position:0%
laundry list that's something that would
 
00:14:27.269 --> 00:14:27.279 align:start position:0%
depend in some states depending on
 
00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:29.440 align:start position:0%
statutory law or in this case depending
 
00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:31.480 align:start position:0%
on the trial judge and to a certain
 
00:14:33.509 --> 00:14:33.519 align:start position:0%
degree the prosecutor so what you're
 
00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:37.240 align:start position:0%
doing is making non-residents have
 
00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:40.600 align:start position:0%
additional um conditions that a resident
 
00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:44.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't have and I argue that 1596 is
 
00:14:45.749 --> 00:14:45.759 align:start position:0%
very clear and that's that if you
 
00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:48.560 align:start position:0%
lawfully can own guns you get a license
 
00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:50.240 align:start position:0%
and I don't see anything in the
 
00:14:52.949 --> 00:14:52.959 align:start position:0%
statutory law that allows them to revoke
 
00:14:55.389 --> 00:14:55.399 align:start position:0%
based on this new condition that's
 
00:14:59.030 --> 00:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
number one and then may a continue with
 
00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:01.360 align:start position:0%
the rest the let ma'am or
 
00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:03.670 align:start position:0%
the rest the let ma'am or
chairman

00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:03.680 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:06.110 align:start position:0%
chairman
um

00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:06.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:09.160 align:start position:0%
21301 I don't believe the laundry list
 
00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:11.720 align:start position:0%
is statutorily correct because again I
 
00:15:13.749 --> 00:15:13.759 align:start position:0%
go back to the fact that we are not to
 
00:15:15.509 --> 00:15:15.519 align:start position:0%
be treat exuse me
 
00:15:15.519 --> 00:15:17.590 align:start position:0%
be treat exuse me
2301

00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:17.600 align:start position:0%
2301
 
00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:22.040 align:start position:0%
21301 I apologize 21301 that says that
 
00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
there are two items a license shall be
 
00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:27.240 align:start position:0%
denied if the applicant is prohibited by
 
00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:30.360 align:start position:0%
federal law or the applicant is
 
00:15:33.430 --> 00:15:33.440 align:start position:0%
prohibited by New Hampshire statute it
 
00:15:36.550 --> 00:15:36.560 align:start position:0%
it says period becomes a resident of New
 
00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:39.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is what the here's what I read
 
00:15:43.629 --> 00:15:43.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:45.880 align:start position:0%
2104 oh I'm sorry
 
00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:48.240 align:start position:0%
02 um
 
00:15:51.269 --> 00:15:51.279 align:start position:0%
21402 conditions for revocation yes
 
00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
thank you that that was the one that we
 
00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:54.800 align:start position:0%
questioned earlier go please please
 
00:15:59.389 --> 00:15:59.399 align:start position:0%
continue yes um and so
 
00:16:01.949 --> 00:16:01.959 align:start position:0%
the other Pro let me look at the form
 
00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:04.120 align:start position:0%
because I wanted to make a specific
 
00:16:07.389 --> 00:16:07.399 align:start position:0%
comment on the form
 
00:16:12.309 --> 00:16:12.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:12.319 --> 00:16:13.829 align:start position:0%
 
me

00:16:13.829 --> 00:16:13.839 align:start position:0%
me
 
00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:17.680 align:start position:0%
the other issue is the suspension or
 
00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:20.710 align:start position:0%
the other issue is the suspension or
revocation

00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:23.069 --> 00:16:23.079 align:start position:0%
hearings I
 
00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:29.000 align:start position:0%
believe that a lensey is not required to
 
00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:30.880 align:start position:0%
provide a reason for contesting the
 
00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:33.720 align:start position:0%
suspension or revocation if someone ask
 
00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:36.440 align:start position:0%
for a hearing or contesting it under 15
 
00:16:38.590 --> 00:16:38.600 align:start position:0%
1596 normally they simply asked for a
 
00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:41.600 align:start position:0%
hearing and I apologize I didn't bring
 
00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:44.040 align:start position:0%
my water up they don't have to provide
 
00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:47.440 align:start position:0%
what's found in safc
 
00:16:51.829 --> 00:16:51.839 align:start position:0%
21051 form of request B4 it says the
 
00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:54.440 align:start position:0%
reason for contesting the suspension or
 
00:16:56.710 --> 00:16:56.720 align:start position:0%
revocation that's not required if one's
 
00:16:58.910 --> 00:16:58.920 align:start position:0%
a resident and I don't believe that the
 
00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:00.880 align:start position:0%
law gives them the authority to add
 
00:17:02.949 --> 00:17:02.959 align:start position:0%
conditions like this to a
 
00:17:05.350 --> 00:17:05.360 align:start position:0%
non-resident I think the law is very
 
00:17:08.350 --> 00:17:08.360 align:start position:0%
clear um the other thing and I think
 
00:17:12.309 --> 00:17:12.319 align:start position:0%
this is a really big issue safc
 
00:17:15.829 --> 00:17:15.839 align:start position:0%
21052 time of request all requests for
 
00:17:17.669 --> 00:17:17.679 align:start position:0%
hearings shall be addressed to the
 
00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:20.160 align:start position:0%
commissioner and shall be postmarked or
 
00:17:21.870 --> 00:17:21.880 align:start position:0%
otherwise received in the office of the
 
00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:25.480 align:start position:0%
commissioner within 7 days from the date
 
00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
of the suspension or
 
00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:29.720 align:start position:0%
revocation I in conquered and there's
 
00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:31.520 align:start position:0%
things from one town over that I
 
00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:33.240 align:start position:0%
sometimes get depending on my mail
 
00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:36.760 align:start position:0%
service up to seven days and so you're
 
00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:38.600 align:start position:0%
talking about a non-resonant where we're
 
00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:40.400 align:start position:0%
going to be mailing something to another
 
00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:42.880 align:start position:0%
state who California Oregon who who
 
00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:45.280 align:start position:0%
knows where even if we're mailing it to
 
00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:49.720 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts they may not
 
00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:54.360 align:start position:0%
um receive it in time to even file that
 
00:17:56.270 --> 00:17:56.280 align:start position:0%
request and I think you're going to get
 
00:17:57.909 --> 00:17:57.919 align:start position:0%
people just giving up saying well gee I
 
00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:01.120 align:start position:0%
can't file it was in 7 days because this
 
00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
21052 time request says shall be
 
00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
addressed to the commissioner and shall
 
00:18:08.350 --> 00:18:08.360 align:start position:0%
be postmarked or otherwise received in
 
00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
the office of the commissioner with
 
00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
postmark being the easiest one to make
 
00:18:14.549 --> 00:18:14.559 align:start position:0%
within seven days from the DAT of
 
00:18:15.669 --> 00:18:15.679 align:start position:0%
suspension or
 
00:18:17.669 --> 00:18:17.679 align:start position:0%
revocation if
 
00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:21.480 align:start position:0%
you revoke something today even in good
 
00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:23.840 align:start position:0%
faith I've talked more than once at the
 
00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:25.240 align:start position:0%
people of the Department of Safety and
 
00:18:28.750 --> 00:18:28.760 align:start position:0%
DMV they put it in a giant mailbox in
 
00:18:30.430 --> 00:18:30.440 align:start position:0%
excuse me to just grab my water so I
 
00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:38.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:41.909 --> 00:18:41.919 align:start position:0%
you even if the employee there didn't
 
00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:43.840 align:start position:0%
put it in the mail carrier service to go
 
00:18:45.789 --> 00:18:45.799 align:start position:0%
out it may be a day or so before it
 
00:18:49.270 --> 00:18:49.280 align:start position:0%
leaves a state agency and I don't think
 
00:18:51.909 --> 00:18:51.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:54.880 align:start position:0%
possible in many cases that it may be
 
00:18:58.029 --> 00:18:58.039 align:start position:0%
received by the person within seven days
 
00:18:59.789 --> 00:18:59.799 align:start position:0%
and furthermore if a person's on
 
00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:02.520 align:start position:0%
vacation or away on a business trip they
 
00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:05.320 align:start position:0%
may not receive that that seven days is
 
00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:06.870 align:start position:0%
may not receive that that seven days is
patently

00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:06.880 align:start position:0%
patently
 
00:19:09.669 --> 00:19:09.679 align:start position:0%
unreasonable period of time and I think
 
00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:12.240 align:start position:0%
it's it's a DEA facto for most people
 
00:19:13.789 --> 00:19:13.799 align:start position:0%
they're not going to make the
 
00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
timeline the safc
 
00:19:21.029 --> 00:19:21.039 align:start position:0%
21053 procedure for hearings
 
00:19:23.710 --> 00:19:23.720 align:start position:0%
um that is going to be subject to
 
00:19:25.789 --> 00:19:25.799 align:start position:0%
changes over time so I think that may or
 
00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:29.640 align:start position:0%
may not be a problem um
 
00:19:31.789 --> 00:19:31.799 align:start position:0%
the other thing is there's no further
 
00:19:34.029 --> 00:19:34.039 align:start position:0%
rules about how long the hearing can
 
00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:35.640 align:start position:0%
last or anything like that and I think
 
00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:38.120 align:start position:0%
it's subject to
 
00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:42.320 align:start position:0%
whim what it essentially is saying too
 
00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:44.480 align:start position:0%
is that if someone's license is revoked
 
00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:46.840 align:start position:0%
if they don't essentially or suspension
 
00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:49.360 align:start position:0%
or revocation if they essentially don't
 
00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:52.120 align:start position:0%
meet the first time
 
00:19:55.870 --> 00:19:55.880 align:start position:0%
period they may or may not be arguably
 
00:19:58.230 --> 00:19:58.240 align:start position:0%
able to appeal from the decision
 
00:20:02.110 --> 00:20:02.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:07.710 --> 00:20:07.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:10.070 align:start position:0%
 
is

00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:20:13.950 --> 00:20:13.960 align:start position:0%
replication the next
 
00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:15.789 align:start position:0%
replication the next
problem

00:20:15.789 --> 00:20:15.799 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:18.440 align:start position:0%
sorry the next problem that we have
 
00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
still is that nonresidents are I believe
 
00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:26.320 align:start position:0%
still being treated differently than
 
00:20:28.510 --> 00:20:28.520 align:start position:0%
residents are going to be treated and I
 
00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:30.400 align:start position:0%
think under the statute that's not
 
00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
allowed I think Department of Safety is
 
00:20:34.990 --> 00:20:35.000 align:start position:0%
reaching above and beyond the authority
 
00:20:36.669 --> 00:20:36.679 align:start position:0%
they have under the
 
00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:38.760 align:start position:0%
law and
 
00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:41.390 align:start position:0%
law and
so

00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:41.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:44.000 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much and I'm happy to
 
00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:45.640 align:start position:0%
answer practical
 
00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:49.200 align:start position:0%
questions are questions representative
 
00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:50.720 align:start position:0%
yes sir I just want to make sure I'm
 
00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:53.120 align:start position:0%
understanding does the
 
00:20:57.190 --> 00:20:57.200 align:start position:0%
um are there is there another section of
 
00:20:58.990 --> 00:20:59.000 align:start position:0%
the regulations it says when the
 
00:21:01.909 --> 00:21:01.919 align:start position:0%
department sends out a notice saying we
 
00:21:01.919 --> 00:21:02.590 align:start position:0%
department sends out a notice saying we
we

00:21:02.590 --> 00:21:02.600 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:06.760 align:start position:0%
are suspending or revoking your license
 
00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:08.360 align:start position:0%
this is the reason we're doing it do
 
00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:10.640 align:start position:0%
they have to tell the person the reason
 
00:21:12.549 --> 00:21:12.559 align:start position:0%
absolutely all right so if they have to
 
00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:14.360 align:start position:0%
tell the person the reason what's the
 
00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:17.400 align:start position:0%
problem with with asking somebody who
 
00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:19.320 align:start position:0%
who wants to contest that to say this is
 
00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:21.760 align:start position:0%
the reason I contest it I'll tell you
 
00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:24.320 align:start position:0%
what the reason is um when a person says
 
00:21:27.029 --> 00:21:27.039 align:start position:0%
not guilty they don't have to say
 
00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
what ciled it's not a criminal
 
00:21:32.669 --> 00:21:32.679 align:start position:0%
proceeding this is a civil or yes sir I
 
00:21:35.909 --> 00:21:35.919 align:start position:0%
understand that um I think the problem
 
00:21:39.350 --> 00:21:39.360 align:start position:0%
is still that there's no reason you are
 
00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:41.880 align:start position:0%
not required to under state law if
 
00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:43.720 align:start position:0%
you're a resident and what you're doing
 
00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:45.440 align:start position:0%
is adding more conditions to
 
00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
non-resident and I don't believe that
 
00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:49.240 align:start position:0%
the law
 
00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
1596 gives them the authority to treat
 
00:21:53.789 --> 00:21:53.799 align:start position:0%
non-residents differently if I were a
 
00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:56.200 align:start position:0%
resident and my license was suspended or
 
00:21:59.070 --> 00:21:59.080 align:start position:0%
revoked I file for a hearing
 
00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:01.960 align:start position:0%
um in conquer District Court I don't
 
00:22:03.710 --> 00:22:03.720 align:start position:0%
have to provide that right right but
 
00:22:05.870 --> 00:22:05.880 align:start position:0%
isn't the isn't the I'm I'm just trying
 
00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:08.240 align:start position:0%
to be practical here is so let's so
 
00:22:10.029 --> 00:22:10.039 align:start position:0%
let's suppose we say you don't have to
 
00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:12.360 align:start position:0%
provide the reason so now you get to
 
00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:16.640 align:start position:0%
court and the the the department says um
 
00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:18.400 align:start position:0%
or you get to the hearing the department
 
00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:20.200 align:start position:0%
says we want to suspend we're going to
 
00:22:23.029 --> 00:22:23.039 align:start position:0%
suspend you for this reason and you come
 
00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:25.640 align:start position:0%
in with some novel
 
00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:28.200 align:start position:0%
response um isn't it very likely the was
 
00:22:29.029 --> 00:22:29.039 align:start position:0%
going to say okay we're going to
 
00:22:30.549 --> 00:22:30.559 align:start position:0%
continue the hearing we're going to
 
00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:32.480 align:start position:0%
continue the hearing because we the the
 
00:22:33.909 --> 00:22:33.919 align:start position:0%
state didn't have notice that you were
 
00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:36.240 align:start position:0%
going to raise this novel response
 
00:22:38.149 --> 00:22:38.159 align:start position:0%
whereas if you had if you had told them
 
00:22:40.029 --> 00:22:40.039 align:start position:0%
in the beginning they would then then
 
00:22:41.390 --> 00:22:41.400 align:start position:0%
they couldn't make that argument so it
 
00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:42.840 align:start position:0%
just seems like it's you're you're just
 
00:22:45.789 --> 00:22:45.799 align:start position:0%
delaying things unreasonably I don't
 
00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:47.480 align:start position:0%
understand that I don't believe you're
 
00:22:49.269 --> 00:22:49.279 align:start position:0%
delaying things unreasonably I think
 
00:22:51.710 --> 00:22:51.720 align:start position:0%
what likely is even more important to me
 
00:22:54.950 --> 00:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
is that I don't want the person to
 
00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:56.950 align:start position:0%
is that I don't want the person to
face

00:22:56.950 --> 00:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
face
 
00:22:59.870 --> 00:22:59.880 align:start position:0%
um what may may or may not later be a
 
00:23:02.070 --> 00:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
fuic victory because the person an
 
00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
average person is not going to be able
 
00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:06.840 align:start position:0%
to give a lawyer response about
 
00:23:11.149 --> 00:23:11.159 align:start position:0%
why the Department's reason
 
00:23:14.149 --> 00:23:14.159 align:start position:0%
for revoking their license is incorrect
 
00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:16.000 align:start position:0%
I think what's very common that a lot of
 
00:23:17.909 --> 00:23:17.919 align:start position:0%
people when they get notices like this
 
00:23:20.029 --> 00:23:20.039 align:start position:0%
will file a response and they'll later
 
00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:22.440 align:start position:0%
on second thought or talking to friends
 
00:23:24.510 --> 00:23:24.520 align:start position:0%
or family will say gee I need to get a
 
00:23:27.669 --> 00:23:27.679 align:start position:0%
lawyer for this and the question is and
 
00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
I I think the answer a lot of times is
 
00:23:31.870 --> 00:23:31.880 align:start position:0%
unfortunate is will the lawyer be able
 
00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
to amend that reason because the
 
00:23:35.390 --> 00:23:35.400 align:start position:0%
department out of hand says well this
 
00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:38.600 align:start position:0%
reason's not the right reason or it's
 
00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:39.549 align:start position:0%
reason's not the right reason or it's
not

00:23:39.549 --> 00:23:39.559 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:43.120 align:start position:0%
adequate and the question is the lawyer
 
00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:45.240 align:start position:0%
says well I know the person wrote that
 
00:23:48.149 --> 00:23:48.159 align:start position:0%
reason but that's not the actual reason
 
00:23:49.710 --> 00:23:49.720 align:start position:0%
that this is incorrect the person was a
 
00:23:51.870 --> 00:23:51.880 align:start position:0%
lay person and they didn't
 
00:23:54.070 --> 00:23:54.080 align:start position:0%
understand and I think that's an issue
 
00:23:55.470 --> 00:23:55.480 align:start position:0%
that you're talking about right back
 
00:23:57.870 --> 00:23:57.880 align:start position:0%
going around that Circle um is that
 
00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
lawyer later going to be allowed to
 
00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.950 align:start position:0%
lawyer later going to be allowed to
amend

00:24:01.950 --> 00:24:01.960 align:start position:0%
amend
 
00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
that all right or or further
 
00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:08.320 align:start position:0%
sir is the department going to say we
 
00:24:10.029 --> 00:24:10.039 align:start position:0%
have no reason for hearing because his
 
00:24:13.310 --> 00:24:13.320 align:start position:0%
reason doesn't cut mustard and this is
 
00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
not a reason to contest the
 
00:24:17.669 --> 00:24:17.679 align:start position:0%
suspension they're going to say it's an
 
00:24:20.990 --> 00:24:21.000 align:start position:0%
issue of law we decided his reason wrong
 
00:24:22.549 --> 00:24:22.559 align:start position:0%
is there a provision that allows them to
 
00:24:22.559 --> 00:24:24.230 align:start position:0%
is there a provision that allows them to
do

00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:24.240 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:26.520 align:start position:0%
that I don't think that here's what I've
 
00:24:28.549 --> 00:24:28.559 align:start position:0%
heard them say more than one there's not
 
00:24:30.750 --> 00:24:30.760 align:start position:0%
a provision that says I can't I've had
 
00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:33.480 align:start position:0%
more than one chief of police smirk when
 
00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
we had the fingerprint and photograph
 
00:24:38.110 --> 00:24:38.120 align:start position:0%
issue until we added that to the statute
 
00:24:39.510 --> 00:24:39.520 align:start position:0%
and they would smirk and say the law
 
00:24:43.269 --> 00:24:43.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:46.950 --> 00:24:46.960 align:start position:0%
can't okay thank you um
 
00:24:49.830 --> 00:24:49.840 align:start position:0%
direct just really quickly with regard
 
00:24:53.110 --> 00:24:53.120 align:start position:0%
to the timeline for regard for notice of
 
00:24:58.990 --> 00:24:59.000 align:start position:0%
suspension RSA 159 6B one specifically
 
00:25:01.669 --> 00:25:01.679 align:start position:0%
says that a lensey Whose license has
 
00:25:03.549 --> 00:25:03.559 align:start position:0%
been suspended or revoked shall be
 
00:25:05.549 --> 00:25:05.559 align:start position:0%
permitted a hearing on such suspension
 
00:25:08.510 --> 00:25:08.520 align:start position:0%
or revocation if a hearing is requested
 
00:25:11.190 --> 00:25:11.200 align:start position:0%
by the Len to the issuing authority
 
00:25:13.149 --> 00:25:13.159 align:start position:0%
within 7 Days of the suspension or
 
00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
revocation so it seems like the rule
 
00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:18.360 align:start position:0%
text is quoting directly from the
 
00:25:21.510 --> 00:25:21.520 align:start position:0%
statute but it doesn't say it doesn't
 
00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:24.320 align:start position:0%
say where it goes specifically here
 
00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:26.640 align:start position:0%
postm marker received within seven days
 
00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:30.720 align:start position:0%
of and I think that's the issue that
 
00:25:32.590 --> 00:25:32.600 align:start position:0%
we're looking at here is when you're out
 
00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
of state it's different if you mail
 
00:25:36.190 --> 00:25:36.200 align:start position:0%
things from con I'm sorry if you mail
 
00:25:38.110 --> 00:25:38.120 align:start position:0%
things from conquered or another area in
 
00:25:40.590 --> 00:25:40.600 align:start position:0%
the state even then it's more likely to
 
00:25:41.950 --> 00:25:41.960 align:start position:0%
be received you're
 
00:25:44.789 --> 00:25:44.799 align:start position:0%
talking a person can in theory can have
 
00:25:46.789 --> 00:25:46.799 align:start position:0%
a license a non-resident license for any
 
00:25:49.190 --> 00:25:49.200 align:start position:0%
one of the other 49 states which include
 
00:25:50.830 --> 00:25:50.840 align:start position:0%
Alaska Hawaii and
 
00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:52.830 align:start position:0%
Alaska Hawaii and
California

00:25:52.830 --> 00:25:52.840 align:start position:0%
California
 
00:25:55.230 --> 00:25:55.240 align:start position:0%
and there's some places you can't even
 
00:25:57.070 --> 00:25:57.080 align:start position:0%
get overnight service to even if you go
 
00:25:59.669 --> 00:25:59.679 align:start position:0%
to FedEx or or whatever um with letters
 
00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:01.360 align:start position:0%
the Postal Service in conquered New
 
00:26:02.669 --> 00:26:02.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire no longer has certain
 
00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:06.840 align:start position:0%
overnight Services well I see your point
 
00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:11.440 align:start position:0%
but if the statute says that it the the
 
00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:14.320 align:start position:0%
request for a hearing must be done
 
00:26:16.750 --> 00:26:16.760 align:start position:0%
within seven days I don't think the rule
 
00:26:19.230 --> 00:26:19.240 align:start position:0%
should contradict
 
00:26:23.549 --> 00:26:23.559 align:start position:0%
that yeah and this might need to be
 
00:26:25.830 --> 00:26:25.840 align:start position:0%
Senator gray the question for the
 
00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:28.880 align:start position:0%
witness are over I think lot
 
00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:32.760 align:start position:0%
turn your mic on that need to happen um
 
00:26:35.430 --> 00:26:35.440 align:start position:0%
and I'm prepared to make motion that
 
00:26:37.909 --> 00:26:37.919 align:start position:0%
this rule be accepted uh with the
 
00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:40.440 align:start position:0%
provision that the department seek res
 
00:26:43.070 --> 00:26:43.080 align:start position:0%
uh resolution uh through the legislature
 
00:26:46.190 --> 00:26:46.200 align:start position:0%
for the conflicts that were noted and
 
00:26:50.549 --> 00:26:50.559 align:start position:0%
that will give the witness time to um
 
00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:53.200 align:start position:0%
pursue uh the things that she is trying
 
00:26:57.230 --> 00:26:57.240 align:start position:0%
to do uh when that uh uh Amendment comes
 
00:26:59.389 --> 00:26:59.399 align:start position:0%
up full legislature I'll second I'll
 
00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:00.880 align:start position:0%
second that
 
00:27:02.990 --> 00:27:03.000 align:start position:0%
motion okay are there any other
 
00:27:05.350 --> 00:27:05.360 align:start position:0%
questions yeah I I do have a concern
 
00:27:07.750 --> 00:27:07.760 align:start position:0%
about this I I'm
 
00:27:13.510 --> 00:27:13.520 align:start position:0%
the I guess I'm I I share the the
 
00:27:16.789 --> 00:27:16.799 align:start position:0%
staff's uh concern about the legislative
 
00:27:21.549 --> 00:27:21.559 align:start position:0%
intent of of um sort of
 
00:27:24.230 --> 00:27:24.240 align:start position:0%
automatically providing for suspension
 
00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
of a non-resident license if the person
 
00:27:28.389 --> 00:27:28.399 align:start position:0%
becomes a licensed becomes a New
 
00:27:30.789 --> 00:27:30.799 align:start position:0%
Hampshire resident I'm not I mean it
 
00:27:34.310 --> 00:27:34.320 align:start position:0%
seems to me that if the legis if the if
 
00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
the statute
 
00:27:40.549 --> 00:27:40.559 align:start position:0%
allows a license a a an instate liy to
 
00:27:43.350 --> 00:27:43.360 align:start position:0%
keep their license if they move from one
 
00:27:46.269 --> 00:27:46.279 align:start position:0%
town to another as long as they provide
 
00:27:49.470 --> 00:27:49.480 align:start position:0%
notice it's not clear to me why it would
 
00:27:53.190 --> 00:27:53.200 align:start position:0%
be why that same and same thing wouldn't
 
00:27:56.149 --> 00:27:56.159 align:start position:0%
apply to a non-resident person who moved
 
00:27:57.990 --> 00:27:58.000 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire why why why shouldn't
 
00:28:00.789 --> 00:28:00.799 align:start position:0%
it simply be if I live if I have a if I
 
00:28:02.350 --> 00:28:02.360 align:start position:0%
live in Rhode Island and I have a New
 
00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:03.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire permit and I move to New
 
00:28:06.389 --> 00:28:06.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I just have to notify New
 
00:28:08.669 --> 00:28:08.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh that I've now I've now
 
00:28:10.830 --> 00:28:10.840 align:start position:0%
moved to New Hampshire and presumably
 
00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:12.640 align:start position:0%
that the next time my permit comes up
 
00:28:13.950 --> 00:28:13.960 align:start position:0%
for Renewal I have to get a New
 
00:28:16.549 --> 00:28:16.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire permit but to just suspend it
 
00:28:18.789 --> 00:28:18.799 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm not quite sure why that makes
 
00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:21.760 align:start position:0%
sense director Mor I'm thinking one
 
00:28:24.909 --> 00:28:24.919 align:start position:0%
thing is this is a non-resident license
 
00:28:27.509 --> 00:28:27.519 align:start position:0%
if you're no longer a non-resident then
 
00:28:30.149 --> 00:28:30.159 align:start position:0%
it seems like the license would be void
 
00:28:31.990 --> 00:28:32.000 align:start position:0%
uh I think there could be an argument
 
00:28:34.389 --> 00:28:34.399 align:start position:0%
that it should convert to a resident
 
00:28:37.430 --> 00:28:37.440 align:start position:0%
license in you know absent to anything
 
00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:43.230 --> 00:28:43.240 align:start position:0%
contrary okay okay all right I see your
 
00:28:45.470 --> 00:28:45.480 align:start position:0%
point Senator GRE but even that would
 
00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:49.360 align:start position:0%
take a legislative solution and so my
 
00:28:52.389 --> 00:28:52.399 align:start position:0%
motion still stands that many of these
 
00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:54.480 align:start position:0%
issues can't be dealt with in this
 
00:28:56.990 --> 00:28:57.000 align:start position:0%
committee and need to be dealt with you
 
00:29:01.870 --> 00:29:01.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:04.480 align:start position:0%
legislature yeah no I I I think I I I
 
00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:06.640 align:start position:0%
see the point actually
 
00:29:09.149 --> 00:29:09.159 align:start position:0%
right any other
 
00:29:11.269 --> 00:29:11.279 align:start position:0%
questions all right thank you Miss Dean
 
00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:12.760 align:start position:0%
for bringing these issues to our
 
00:29:15.269 --> 00:29:15.279 align:start position:0%
attention offer one final thought please
 
00:29:18.470 --> 00:29:18.480 align:start position:0%
please um when a person applies for a
 
00:29:21.350 --> 00:29:21.360 align:start position:0%
license to carry in any other state of
 
00:29:23.549 --> 00:29:23.559 align:start position:0%
every application I've ever seen one of
 
00:29:25.549 --> 00:29:25.559 align:start position:0%
the questions they always ask that I've
 
00:29:28.750 --> 00:29:28.760 align:start position:0%
read is have you LIC had a license in
 
00:29:30.950 --> 00:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
this or any other state revoked denied
 
00:29:32.669 --> 00:29:32.679 align:start position:0%
rescinded it has a whole bunch of lawyer
 
00:29:35.269 --> 00:29:35.279 align:start position:0%
words if this happens if this is in
 
00:29:36.830 --> 00:29:36.840 align:start position:0%
place you're going to have to say yes
 
00:29:38.509 --> 00:29:38.519 align:start position:0%
and explain
 
00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
why and the minute you say yes on most
 
00:29:44.190 --> 00:29:44.200 align:start position:0%
applications it puts you in a category
 
00:29:45.549 --> 00:29:45.559 align:start position:0%
that you get scrutinized and you're
 
00:29:46.830 --> 00:29:46.840 align:start position:0%
going to have to say yes the rest of
 
00:29:48.789 --> 00:29:48.799 align:start position:0%
your life and yes you'll be able to
 
00:29:51.230 --> 00:29:51.240 align:start position:0%
point to the statute and say you moved
 
00:29:52.990 --> 00:29:53.000 align:start position:0%
but I can tell you that Massachusetts
 
00:29:55.110 --> 00:29:55.120 align:start position:0%
and other places when you move as long
 
00:29:57.389 --> 00:29:57.399 align:start position:0%
as you notify them within 30 days
 
00:30:00.110 --> 00:30:00.120 align:start position:0%
certified mail your license remains
 
00:30:01.789 --> 00:30:01.799 align:start position:0%
valid for the end of the term even when
 
00:30:03.870 --> 00:30:03.880 align:start position:0%
you move out of Massachusetts so long as
 
00:30:06.909 --> 00:30:06.919 align:start position:0%
you notify them so this is again going
 
00:30:08.389 --> 00:30:08.399 align:start position:0%
to cause all sorts of problems that I
 
00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:10.960 align:start position:0%
don't think just to reiterate what you
 
00:30:16.909 --> 00:30:16.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:20.389 --> 00:30:20.399 align:start position:0%
allowed okay thank you for that date
 
00:30:22.630 --> 00:30:22.640 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman direct if I may
 
00:30:26.029 --> 00:30:26.039 align:start position:0%
uh again to representative Lynn I I see
 
00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:29.440 align:start position:0%
where saying automatic suspension um if
 
00:30:30.950 --> 00:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
you move to New Hampshire could be a
 
00:30:33.509 --> 00:30:33.519 align:start position:0%
problem because if you have to note to
 
00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
some other state that you have been
 
00:30:38.269 --> 00:30:38.279 align:start position:0%
suspended uh I mean r had a license
 
00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:40.720 align:start position:0%
revoked then that could create
 
00:30:43.269 --> 00:30:43.279 align:start position:0%
problems so perhaps a legislative
 
00:30:46.070 --> 00:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
solution really is right no I I agree I
 
00:30:47.710 --> 00:30:47.720 align:start position:0%
think I think what you and Senator gray
 
00:30:49.230 --> 00:30:49.240 align:start position:0%
have said is make make sense it probably
 
00:30:50.710 --> 00:30:50.720 align:start position:0%
should be a solution a legislative
 
00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:54.320 align:start position:0%
solution okay any other questions or
 
00:30:57.830 --> 00:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
comments all right the uh the motion is
 
00:30:59.830 --> 00:30:59.840 align:start position:0%
to approve the rule with the
 
00:31:02.430 --> 00:31:02.440 align:start position:0%
recommendation that the department seek
 
00:31:05.029 --> 00:31:05.039 align:start position:0%
legislative clarification of these
 
00:31:10.149 --> 00:31:10.159 align:start position:0%
issues those in favor I any opposed all
 
00:31:18.669 --> 00:31:18.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:21.789 --> 00:31:21.799 align:start position:0%
much next is 2023
 
00:31:26.149 --> 00:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:29.870 --> 00:31:29.880 align:start position:0%
um Mobile Service Garage rules and
 
00:31:31.789 --> 00:31:31.799 align:start position:0%
there's a couple of
 
00:31:35.389 --> 00:31:35.399 align:start position:0%
unclear one uh the agency uses the word
 
00:31:38.750 --> 00:31:38.760 align:start position:0%
will and will is not Lang uh rule
 
00:31:40.990 --> 00:31:41.000 align:start position:0%
language it should be shall and that
 
00:31:42.789 --> 00:31:42.799 align:start position:0%
makes it clear what the acttion the
 
00:31:45.629 --> 00:31:45.639 align:start position:0%
action is mandatory and the other issue
 
00:31:50.350 --> 00:31:50.360 align:start position:0%
with this one is um there's a line in in
 
00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:51.110 align:start position:0%
with this one is um there's a line in in
the

00:31:51.110 --> 00:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:31:53.149 --> 00:31:53.159 align:start position:0%
form on the
 
00:31:55.470 --> 00:31:55.480 align:start position:0%
certification that is not in the rule
 
00:31:57.830 --> 00:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
text so both of the these things could
 
00:32:00.470 --> 00:32:00.480 align:start position:0%
actually be fixed with an oral uh
 
00:32:02.470 --> 00:32:02.480 align:start position:0%
conditional approval just to change that
 
00:32:04.830 --> 00:32:04.840 align:start position:0%
will to shall and to add that sentence
 
00:32:07.669 --> 00:32:07.679 align:start position:0%
in so if the agency is willing to do
 
00:32:09.870 --> 00:32:09.880 align:start position:0%
that oral conditional approval then that
 
00:32:11.870 --> 00:32:11.880 align:start position:0%
that's all the comments I
 
00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:13.830 align:start position:0%
that's all the comments I
have

00:32:13.830 --> 00:32:13.840 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:32:16.509 --> 00:32:16.519 align:start position:0%
okay good morning um attorney Dave Hills

00:32:47.909 --> 00:32:47.919 align:start position:0%
Department comments concerns all right

then the motion is to approve the rule
 
00:32:49.919 --> 00:32:50.950 align:start position:0%
then the motion is to approve the rule
with

00:32:50.950 --> 00:32:50.960 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:32:54.190 --> 00:32:54.200 align:start position:0%
the uh conditions as
 
00:32:58.509 --> 00:32:58.519 align:start position:0%
stated those in favor I
 
00:33:08.669 --> 00:33:08.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:10.950 --> 00:33:10.960 align:start position:0%
much item
 
00:33:15.470 --> 00:33:15.480 align:start position:0%
e uh so item e is 2023 177 from
 
00:33:16.950 --> 00:33:16.960 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:33:18.590 --> 00:33:18.600 align:start position:0%
on General payment
 
00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:21.480 align:start position:0%
information the department did submit an
 
00:33:23.310 --> 00:33:23.320 align:start position:0%
amended conditional approval that
 
00:33:24.950 --> 00:33:24.960 align:start position:0%
addressed all of the substantive
 
00:33:27.389 --> 00:33:27.399 align:start position:0%
comments except for one and that is that
 
00:33:29.789 --> 00:33:29.799 align:start position:0%
this rule has been expired since August
 
00:33:32.029 --> 00:33:32.039 align:start position:0%
31st of
 
00:33:36.830 --> 00:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
2000 um so that is a legislative intent
 
00:33:39.909 --> 00:33:39.919 align:start position:0%
comment um Regarding why this rule has
 
00:33:41.950 --> 00:33:41.960 align:start position:0%
been expired and whether or not the
 
00:33:44.230 --> 00:33:44.240 align:start position:0%
department has been enforcing the rules
 
00:33:46.950 --> 00:33:46.960 align:start position:0%
while they've been expired um and I also
 
00:33:48.269 --> 00:33:48.279 align:start position:0%
wanted to just bring to the committee's
 
00:33:50.470 --> 00:33:50.480 align:start position:0%
attention that late yesterday afternoon
 
00:33:53.350 --> 00:33:53.360 align:start position:0%
we did received some public testimony
 
00:33:54.629 --> 00:33:54.639 align:start position:0%
from the New Hampshire Hospital
 
00:33:56.509 --> 00:33:56.519 align:start position:0%
Association which I've put a copy on
 
00:33:57.830 --> 00:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
your desk
 
00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:00.960 align:start position:0%
um but this is in support of the rule
 
00:34:04.029 --> 00:34:04.039 align:start position:0%
um but we haven't received any testimony
 
00:34:06.789 --> 00:34:06.799 align:start position:0%
um against the rule at this
 
00:34:10.909 --> 00:34:10.919 align:start position:0%
time okay thank you uh good morning
 
00:34:12.950 --> 00:34:12.960 align:start position:0%
Nicole Valena uh from Department of
 
00:34:14.389 --> 00:34:14.399 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services administrative
 
00:34:16.990 --> 00:34:17.000 align:start position:0%
rules unit and I have uh Rob Barry legal
 
00:34:19.589 --> 00:34:19.599 align:start position:0%
counsel for Medicaid with me uh first
 
00:34:21.430 --> 00:34:21.440 align:start position:0%
and foremost the department is honestly
 
00:34:22.829 --> 00:34:22.839 align:start position:0%
just taking full ownership that this
 
00:34:25.149 --> 00:34:25.159 align:start position:0%
rule has been uh expired for an
 
00:34:27.629 --> 00:34:27.639 align:start position:0%
egregious amount of time none of us were
 
00:34:31.349 --> 00:34:31.359 align:start position:0%
here at that time of course uh it was
 
00:34:34.149 --> 00:34:34.159 align:start position:0%
discovered in some recent years and work
 
00:34:35.790 --> 00:34:35.800 align:start position:0%
did begin on this Rule and has been
 
00:34:36.909 --> 00:34:36.919 align:start position:0%
worked on
 
00:34:39.149 --> 00:34:39.159 align:start position:0%
intermittently uh honestly the rule
 
00:34:41.109 --> 00:34:41.119 align:start position:0%
hasn't been enforced in the past 23
 
00:34:43.470 --> 00:34:43.480 align:start position:0%
years the department has just relied
 
00:34:46.669 --> 00:34:46.679 align:start position:0%
upon sort of the framework of applicable
 
00:34:49.310 --> 00:34:49.320 align:start position:0%
cfrs rsas and any other administrative
 
00:34:52.230 --> 00:34:52.240 align:start position:0%
rules so really we're here to correct
 
00:34:55.030 --> 00:34:55.040 align:start position:0%
this Implement a rule that is very much
 
00:34:58.390 --> 00:34:58.400 align:start position:0%
needed um
 
00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:00.720 align:start position:0%
which will you know flush out and give
 
00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:02.880 align:start position:0%
detail to the requirements necessary in
 
00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:03.950 align:start position:0%
detail to the requirements necessary in
the

00:35:03.950 --> 00:35:03.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:35:07.390 --> 00:35:07.400 align:start position:0%
rule that's honestly where we
 
00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
are representative gr so if the rule
 
00:35:13.870 --> 00:35:13.880 align:start position:0%
hasn't been used in 23 years yet you say
 
00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:21.349 --> 00:35:21.359 align:start position:0%
that yeah I
 
00:35:23.990 --> 00:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
don't good morning robberry General
 
00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
Council of the division of Medicaid um
 
00:35:30.030 --> 00:35:30.040 align:start position:0%
so as uh Nicole mentioned that we have
 
00:35:33.390 --> 00:35:33.400 align:start position:0%
been relying on federal Authority State
 
00:35:36.109 --> 00:35:36.119 align:start position:0%
statutes and other administrative rules
 
00:35:38.190 --> 00:35:38.200 align:start position:0%
what this does is really fill in some
 
00:35:41.950 --> 00:35:41.960 align:start position:0%
gaps that those uh statutes and rules
 
00:35:45.270 --> 00:35:45.280 align:start position:0%
don't cover so this is a general payment
 
00:35:47.349 --> 00:35:47.359 align:start position:0%
rule the other rules we have in place
 
00:35:49.069 --> 00:35:49.079 align:start position:0%
are more specific to this so this is
 
00:35:50.750 --> 00:35:50.760 align:start position:0%
just to really add some belts and
 
00:35:54.589 --> 00:35:54.599 align:start position:0%
suspenders to those um those rules thank
 
00:35:58.990 --> 00:35:59.000 align:start position:0%
you that makes sense anyone
 
00:36:02.349 --> 00:36:02.359 align:start position:0%
else it still strikes me as bizarre that
 
00:36:04.790 --> 00:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
you could have had had it expired for
 
00:36:09.470 --> 00:36:09.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:12.390 --> 00:36:12.400 align:start position:0%
notice I mean yes we again
 
00:36:14.910 --> 00:36:14.920 align:start position:0%
we uh acknowledge that and take
 
00:36:16.790 --> 00:36:16.800 align:start position:0%
ownership and again it was discovered
 
00:36:19.309 --> 00:36:19.319 align:start position:0%
within the past maybe seven years with
 
00:36:21.309 --> 00:36:21.319 align:start position:0%
the current leadership in place and they
 
00:36:23.630 --> 00:36:23.640 align:start position:0%
did Begin work on that um and it's been
 
00:36:25.309 --> 00:36:25.319 align:start position:0%
worked on intermittently and this rule
 
00:36:27.589 --> 00:36:27.599 align:start position:0%
was actually a complete over Hall to get
 
00:36:29.190 --> 00:36:29.200 align:start position:0%
up to date with current
 
00:36:32.829 --> 00:36:32.839 align:start position:0%
processes um so it's it's been a taxing
 
00:36:35.109 --> 00:36:35.119 align:start position:0%
situation but we are here to correct
 
00:36:39.150 --> 00:36:39.160 align:start position:0%
that uh and put again some necessary uh
 
00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
items in place thank
 
00:36:46.829 --> 00:36:46.839 align:start position:0%
you I'll move to approve second time to
 
00:36:50.550 --> 00:36:50.560 align:start position:0%
fix it now Senator gr um there is at
 
00:36:53.430 --> 00:36:53.440 align:start position:0%
least one unfair note
 
00:36:59.030 --> 00:36:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:01.510 --> 00:37:01.520 align:start position:0%
um was that on the conditional approval
 
00:37:03.430 --> 00:37:03.440 align:start position:0%
because they did submit an amended
 
00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:04.800 align:start position:0%
conditional approval that addressed that
 
00:37:06.710 --> 00:37:06.720 align:start position:0%
unclear um they
 
00:37:15.069 --> 00:37:15.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:17.270 --> 00:37:17.280 align:start position:0%
yeah I would
 
00:37:20.230 --> 00:37:20.240 align:start position:0%
uh like to comment that if there are
 
00:37:22.750 --> 00:37:22.760 align:start position:0%
other expired rules I certainly hope
 
00:37:26.069 --> 00:37:26.079 align:start position:0%
they are being worked on a little faster
 
00:37:28.950 --> 00:37:28.960 align:start position:0%
than this one has
 
00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:31.440 align:start position:0%
been all right any further comments
 
00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:33.670 align:start position:0%
been all right any further comments
questions

00:37:33.670 --> 00:37:33.680 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:37:36.309 --> 00:37:36.319 align:start position:0%
concerns seeing none the motion is to
 
00:37:37.510 --> 00:37:37.520 align:start position:0%
approve the
 
00:37:41.349 --> 00:37:41.359 align:start position:0%
rule those in favor I I
 
00:37:44.109 --> 00:37:44.119 align:start position:0%
opposed all right thank you very
 
00:37:47.910 --> 00:37:47.920 align:start position:0%
much thank you thank you all right
 
00:37:50.950 --> 00:37:50.960 align:start position:0%
Lottery we do have public comment on
 
00:37:56.109 --> 00:37:56.119 align:start position:0%
that yes this is uh two 2023 206 a
 
00:37:56.119 --> 00:37:57.430 align:start position:0%
that yes this is uh two 2023 206 a
lottery

00:37:57.430 --> 00:37:57.440 align:start position:0%
lottery
 
00:38:00.910 --> 00:38:00.920 align:start position:0%
7100 and um there's an unclear
 
00:38:03.790 --> 00:38:03.800 align:start position:0%
comment that uh public testimony has
 
00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:06.160 align:start position:0%
been submitted that expresses concern
 
00:38:09.470 --> 00:38:09.480 align:start position:0%
that it is subjective um it is unclear
 
00:38:11.470 --> 00:38:11.480 align:start position:0%
if the agency can provide a couple
 
00:38:13.550 --> 00:38:13.560 align:start position:0%
examples for what take demonstrable
 
00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:17.280 align:start position:0%
measures means um it would be good if
 
00:38:19.470 --> 00:38:19.480 align:start position:0%
that was clarified uh the agency
 
00:38:21.589 --> 00:38:21.599 align:start position:0%
responded however saying that the rule
 
00:38:24.910 --> 00:38:24.920 align:start position:0%
does not dictate exact measures um to be
 
00:38:27.430 --> 00:38:27.440 align:start position:0%
taken because every situation is unique
 
00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
and the language is intentionally left
 
00:38:31.790 --> 00:38:31.800 align:start position:0%
vague to allow for flexibility and
 
00:38:34.150 --> 00:38:34.160 align:start position:0%
compliance I'm not sure if the agency
 
00:38:36.910 --> 00:38:36.920 align:start position:0%
wants to respond to that one um there's
 
00:38:39.670 --> 00:38:39.680 align:start position:0%
an unclear comment um so the
 
00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner can cancel and vacate or
 
00:38:43.829 --> 00:38:43.839 align:start position:0%
modify the approval of dispensing
 
00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:46.640 align:start position:0%
devices but um it does not lay out the
 
00:38:48.349 --> 00:38:48.359 align:start position:0%
criteria the commission will use to
 
00:38:50.150 --> 00:38:50.160 align:start position:0%
determine when and which approvals the
 
00:38:53.309 --> 00:38:53.319 align:start position:0%
cancel or to to cancel or modify and
 
00:38:55.230 --> 00:38:55.240 align:start position:0%
then there's a couple of unclear that
 
00:38:57.510 --> 00:38:57.520 align:start position:0%
have to deal with a misspelled citation
 
00:39:01.109 --> 00:39:01.119 align:start position:0%
and incorrect citation and uh some some
 
00:39:03.550 --> 00:39:03.560 align:start position:0%
web links that are not working other
 
00:39:05.109 --> 00:39:05.119 align:start position:0%
than that I have no comments but there
 
00:39:07.430 --> 00:39:07.440 align:start position:0%
is public testimony on
 
00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:11.750 align:start position:0%
is public testimony on
this

00:39:11.750 --> 00:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:13.910 --> 00:39:13.920 align:start position:0%

up
 
00:39:55.390 --> 00:39:55.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:55.400 --> 00:40:04.790 align:start position:0%
 
M

00:40:04.790 --> 00:40:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:06.030 --> 00:40:06.040 align:start position:0%
good morning Madam chair and members of
 
00:40:07.710 --> 00:40:07.720 align:start position:0%
the committee uh my name is Michael mof
 
00:40:09.829 --> 00:40:09.839 align:start position:0%
represent Community Bingo in Manchester
 
00:40:12.630 --> 00:40:12.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and filed a written uh
 
00:40:15.510 --> 00:40:15.520 align:start position:0%
notice about some parts of the lottery
 
00:40:17.870 --> 00:40:17.880 align:start position:0%
7100 want to thank Valerie first for all
 
00:40:19.910 --> 00:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
the hard work she put into this program
 
00:40:23.069 --> 00:40:23.079 align:start position:0%
but as my written submission points out
 
00:40:26.470 --> 00:40:26.480 align:start position:0%
one of the um sections in the revised
 
00:40:29.390 --> 00:40:29.400 align:start position:0%
Lottery 7100 is putting new requirements
 
00:40:31.069 --> 00:40:31.079 align:start position:0%
on what are called gaming
 
00:40:33.510 --> 00:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
Consultants the gaming Consultants have
 
00:40:35.750 --> 00:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
uh evolved over the last decade to help
 
00:40:38.589 --> 00:40:38.599 align:start position:0%
Charities conduct Bingo and Lucky 7
 
00:40:41.910 --> 00:40:41.920 align:start position:0%
games Bingo and Lucky 7 uh sound like
 
00:40:43.710 --> 00:40:43.720 align:start position:0%
two different products but in certain
 
00:40:45.230 --> 00:40:45.240 align:start position:0%
environments particularly the Bingo
 
00:40:46.630 --> 00:40:46.640 align:start position:0%
commercial Hall environment they're one
 
00:40:50.349 --> 00:40:50.359 align:start position:0%
and the same so when a uh charity has
 
00:40:52.630 --> 00:40:52.640 align:start position:0%
signed up to play a bingo game what the
 
00:40:54.710 --> 00:40:54.720 align:start position:0%
bingo game does is bring in the foot
 
00:40:57.309 --> 00:40:57.319 align:start position:0%
traffic to sell the Lucky 7 tickets the
 
00:40:59.670 --> 00:40:59.680 align:start position:0%
gaming Consultants function as a
 
00:41:02.270 --> 00:41:02.280 align:start position:0%
resource to the Charities and as we know
 
00:41:04.829 --> 00:41:04.839 align:start position:0%
the uh volunteers for Charities have
 
00:41:07.829 --> 00:41:07.839 align:start position:0%
evaporating quickly over the last decade
 
00:41:10.589 --> 00:41:10.599 align:start position:0%
our objection to uh laot
 
00:41:13.309 --> 00:41:13.319 align:start position:0%
71033 is is putting specific
 
00:41:16.829 --> 00:41:16.839 align:start position:0%
requirements on the lucky s uh
 
00:41:19.470 --> 00:41:19.480 align:start position:0%
consultant that are different than the
 
00:41:21.550 --> 00:41:21.560 align:start position:0%
requirements on the Bingo consultant
 
00:41:23.390 --> 00:41:23.400 align:start position:0%
when in fact the games are conducted at
 
00:41:27.109 --> 00:41:27.119 align:start position:0%
the same time secondarily we feel the um
 
00:41:31.309 --> 00:41:31.319 align:start position:0%
language in the revised
 
00:41:34.230 --> 00:41:34.240 align:start position:0%
71303 is U very subjective and going to
 
00:41:36.950 --> 00:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
be impossible for a consultant to be
 
00:41:41.990 --> 00:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
able to uh uh comply with uh the words
 
00:41:46.470 --> 00:41:46.480 align:start position:0%
in 7103 E1 a a demonstrable measure and
 
00:41:49.190 --> 00:41:49.200 align:start position:0%
that's a very subjective uh term that I
 
00:41:51.670 --> 00:41:51.680 align:start position:0%
don't know how you'd go into a facility
 
00:41:53.390 --> 00:41:53.400 align:start position:0%
and say what measures have you taken is
 
00:41:56.750 --> 00:41:56.760 align:start position:0%
that measure so demonstrable that uh a
 
00:41:59.069 --> 00:41:59.079 align:start position:0%
lack of demonstrable that it violates
 
00:42:01.750 --> 00:42:01.760 align:start position:0%
the the law itself could you repeat that
 
00:42:04.870 --> 00:42:04.880 align:start position:0%
citation uh
 
00:42:10.630 --> 00:42:10.640 align:start position:0%
7103 yes uh sub paragraph e is that
 
00:42:14.550 --> 00:42:14.560 align:start position:0%
71301 or 03
 
00:42:18.470 --> 00:42:18.480 align:start position:0%
71033 03 thank you no wonder
 
00:42:22.990 --> 00:42:23.000 align:start position:0%
e paragraph e subparagraph one requests
 
00:42:26.470 --> 00:42:26.480 align:start position:0%
a demonstrable measure to be taken to
 
00:42:28.190 --> 00:42:28.200 align:start position:0%
mitigate all possible conflicts of
 
00:42:31.069 --> 00:42:31.079 align:start position:0%
interest uh I don't know how that can be
 
00:42:31.079 --> 00:42:33.109 align:start position:0%
interest uh I don't know how that can be
met

00:42:33.109 --> 00:42:33.119 align:start position:0%
met
 
00:42:36.790 --> 00:42:36.800 align:start position:0%
um further down in 7103 E3 there's a
 
00:42:39.910 --> 00:42:39.920 align:start position:0%
request for to keep a detailed log uh
 
00:42:41.950 --> 00:42:41.960 align:start position:0%
and there's no further definition in
 
00:42:45.870 --> 00:42:45.880 align:start position:0%
anywhere of the of the um of 7100 what a
 
00:42:48.549 --> 00:42:48.559 align:start position:0%
detail log is and you've got to look at
 
00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
this in the uh relationship of the uh
 
00:42:55.030 --> 00:42:55.040 align:start position:0%
bingo consultant and the application
 
00:42:56.950 --> 00:42:56.960 align:start position:0%
that they file with the Lottery
 
00:42:58.630 --> 00:42:58.640 align:start position:0%
Commission the application is approved
 
00:42:59.829 --> 00:42:59.839 align:start position:0%
by the Lottery Commission the
 
00:43:02.549 --> 00:43:02.559 align:start position:0%
application covers both Bingo and Lucky
 
00:43:04.549 --> 00:43:04.559 align:start position:0%
7 it's the same application the same
 
00:43:06.990 --> 00:43:07.000 align:start position:0%
piece of paper but what
 
00:43:10.750 --> 00:43:10.760 align:start position:0%
7103 uh 03 does is create a difference
 
00:43:12.430 --> 00:43:12.440 align:start position:0%
between a bingo consultant and a Lucky
 
00:43:15.470 --> 00:43:15.480 align:start position:0%
Seven consultant so the same consultant
 
00:43:17.750 --> 00:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
on the same evening will have two sets
 
00:43:20.030 --> 00:43:20.040 align:start position:0%
of rules uh they'll have to have a
 
00:43:22.390 --> 00:43:22.400 align:start position:0%
demonstrable uh effort to mitigate all
 
00:43:24.190 --> 00:43:24.200 align:start position:0%
conflicts but the Bingo consultant won't
 
00:43:25.670 --> 00:43:25.680 align:start position:0%
but they're actually one and the same
 
00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:26.829 align:start position:0%
but they're actually one and the same
person

00:43:26.829 --> 00:43:26.839 align:start position:0%
person
 
00:43:28.190 --> 00:43:28.200 align:start position:0%
ah well that would certainly be
 
00:43:29.190 --> 00:43:29.200 align:start position:0%
difficult to
 
00:43:31.030 --> 00:43:31.040 align:start position:0%
manage and that's that's where our
 
00:43:32.829 --> 00:43:32.839 align:start position:0%
objection Lies We agree with rest the
 
00:43:34.030 --> 00:43:34.040 align:start position:0%
rest of what the lottery presented and
 
00:43:35.510 --> 00:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
they did a great job but this one seemed
 
00:43:39.030 --> 00:43:39.040 align:start position:0%
to create a conflict that the um the
 
00:43:42.390 --> 00:43:42.400 align:start position:0%
conflict arose in in the U some issues
 
00:43:44.190 --> 00:43:44.200 align:start position:0%
that arose between some Bingo
 
00:43:46.710 --> 00:43:46.720 align:start position:0%
consultants and the certain Bingo
 
00:43:49.470 --> 00:43:49.480 align:start position:0%
Consultants actually uh work for the
 
00:43:52.510 --> 00:43:52.520 align:start position:0%
hall but it's impossible to separate
 
00:43:55.069 --> 00:43:55.079 align:start position:0%
that relationship and I don't think 71
 
00:43:58.510 --> 00:43:58.520 align:start position:0%
0303 uh does anything to help that it
 
00:44:02.750 --> 00:44:02.760 align:start position:0%
adds in more confusion uh if you as the
 
00:44:04.430 --> 00:44:04.440 align:start position:0%
um and pretty much that's all we have to
 
00:44:06.870 --> 00:44:06.880 align:start position:0%
say is that we'd like to see the similar
 
00:44:08.910 --> 00:44:08.920 align:start position:0%
uh similar rules for both sides of the
 
00:44:11.349 --> 00:44:11.359 align:start position:0%
games because they come at the same time
 
00:44:13.470 --> 00:44:13.480 align:start position:0%
uh and that will conclude my testimony
 
00:44:16.750 --> 00:44:16.760 align:start position:0%
okay are questions I think we need to
 
00:44:19.349 --> 00:44:19.359 align:start position:0%
hear the agency answer to the that
 
00:44:24.990 --> 00:44:25.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:29.750 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:44:29.750 --> 00:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:31.390 --> 00:44:31.400 align:start position:0%
morning again my name is Valerie King
 
00:44:33.670 --> 00:44:33.680 align:start position:0%
with New Hampshire lottery um I just
 
00:44:36.430 --> 00:44:36.440 align:start position:0%
want to let you know that it Bingo and
 
00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
Lucky 7 are pretty intertwined but they
 
00:44:42.030 --> 00:44:42.040 align:start position:0%
are separate rules but it's difficult to
 
00:44:45.750 --> 00:44:45.760 align:start position:0%
do promulgation at the same time um so I
 
00:44:48.150 --> 00:44:48.160 align:start position:0%
am in the process of doing the bingo so
 
00:44:50.870 --> 00:44:50.880 align:start position:0%
it'll be Lucky Seven Bingo coming right
 
00:44:53.030 --> 00:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
in behind it um I've already sent out
 
00:44:56.109 --> 00:44:56.119 align:start position:0%
the draft Bingo rules for stakeholder
 
00:44:59.750 --> 00:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
pre ruem comments so we'll take what we
 
00:45:02.309 --> 00:45:02.319 align:start position:0%
receive from that and we'll begin the um
 
00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
Bingo Ru making subsequent to
 
00:45:09.150 --> 00:45:09.160 align:start position:0%
this um as for the demonstrable um
 
00:45:11.990 --> 00:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
measures we we can add language to give
 
00:45:13.950 --> 00:45:13.960 align:start position:0%
some examples of that but some that I
 
00:45:15.630 --> 00:45:15.640 align:start position:0%
can think of off the top of my head
 
00:45:18.069 --> 00:45:18.079 align:start position:0%
would would be number one making sure
 
00:45:22.030 --> 00:45:22.040 align:start position:0%
that Charities um are clearly allowed to
 
00:45:24.829 --> 00:45:24.839 align:start position:0%
have Consultants that are not employees
 
00:45:27.150 --> 00:45:27.160 align:start position:0%
of the hall would be one measure that
 
00:45:30.430 --> 00:45:30.440 align:start position:0%
they could take policies um clearly
 
00:45:33.549 --> 00:45:33.559 align:start position:0%
defining what those uh services are that
 
00:45:37.470 --> 00:45:37.480 align:start position:0%
are for the employer the hall versus
 
00:45:39.670 --> 00:45:39.680 align:start position:0%
what they're doing as a consultant which
 
00:45:43.150 --> 00:45:43.160 align:start position:0%
is uh their independent
 
00:45:45.710 --> 00:45:45.720 align:start position:0%
license the other thing would of course
 
00:45:48.150 --> 00:45:48.160 align:start position:0%
be to maintain that log that log that
 
00:45:50.309 --> 00:45:50.319 align:start position:0%
tells the Charities exactly what
 
00:45:53.309 --> 00:45:53.319 align:start position:0%
services were provided on their behalf
 
00:45:55.069 --> 00:45:55.079 align:start position:0%
this is something that um a lot of
 
00:45:57.430 --> 00:45:57.440 align:start position:0%
different type of Consulting uh
 
00:45:59.829 --> 00:45:59.839 align:start position:0%
occupations would do they' keep a log of
 
00:46:02.109 --> 00:46:02.119 align:start position:0%
the services they actually provided so
 
00:46:04.150 --> 00:46:04.160 align:start position:0%
that if the charity has any questions
 
00:46:06.069 --> 00:46:06.079 align:start position:0%
they know what services were actually
 
00:46:07.790 --> 00:46:07.800 align:start position:0%
provided on their
 
00:46:10.510 --> 00:46:10.520 align:start position:0%
behalf um and then we we did leave it
 
00:46:12.109 --> 00:46:12.119 align:start position:0%
somewhat vague because there are some
 
00:46:14.990 --> 00:46:15.000 align:start position:0%
unique situations that um might be
 
00:46:16.870 --> 00:46:16.880 align:start position:0%
unique to a particular hall or a
 
00:46:18.589 --> 00:46:18.599 align:start position:0%
particular charity so we didn't want to
 
00:46:20.030 --> 00:46:20.040 align:start position:0%
confine it too
 
00:46:25.030 --> 00:46:25.040 align:start position:0%
much okay is and this relationship of
 
00:46:28.190 --> 00:46:28.200 align:start position:0%
this section is only about a gaming
 
00:46:29.870 --> 00:46:29.880 align:start position:0%
consultant who is
 
00:46:33.230 --> 00:46:33.240 align:start position:0%
also involved with the facility if
 
00:46:36.309 --> 00:46:36.319 align:start position:0%
there's an independent consultant this
 
00:46:43.990 --> 00:46:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:47.470 --> 00:46:47.480 align:start position:0%
correct any other questions yeah Madam
 
00:46:49.630 --> 00:46:49.640 align:start position:0%
chair yes thank you represent haen
 
00:46:51.470 --> 00:46:51.480 align:start position:0%
Phillips thank you for taking my
 
00:46:52.990 --> 00:46:53.000 align:start position:0%
question I just wanted to make sure that
 
00:46:54.829 --> 00:46:54.839 align:start position:0%
I understood correctly that the new set
 
00:46:56.910 --> 00:46:56.920 align:start position:0%
of rules that will be coming com uh that
 
00:46:58.470 --> 00:46:58.480 align:start position:0%
you're currently working on that will be
 
00:47:00.790 --> 00:47:00.800 align:start position:0%
coming in later I can't remember if it
 
00:47:03.950 --> 00:47:03.960 align:start position:0%
must be Bingo next is it your intention
 
00:47:07.510 --> 00:47:07.520 align:start position:0%
that they should reflect or mirror the
 
00:47:09.190 --> 00:47:09.200 align:start position:0%
the Lucky Seven rules that we're
 
00:47:11.829 --> 00:47:11.839 align:start position:0%
reviewing now yes exactly there was a
 
00:47:13.790 --> 00:47:13.800 align:start position:0%
lot of intertwining so I wanted to make
 
00:47:16.990 --> 00:47:17.000 align:start position:0%
sure I got one through before I did the
 
00:47:18.670 --> 00:47:18.680 align:start position:0%
other otherwise I might end up with
 
00:47:20.069 --> 00:47:20.079 align:start position:0%
conflicts if I tried to do them at the
 
00:47:23.309 --> 00:47:23.319 align:start position:0%
same time thank you thank you other
 
00:47:26.270 --> 00:47:26.280 align:start position:0%
questions all right thank you very much
 
00:47:28.309 --> 00:47:28.319 align:start position:0%
we do have another person who wishes to
 
00:47:38.589 --> 00:47:38.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:41.069 --> 00:47:41.079 align:start position:0%
Kung good morning I'm Karen kiring I'm
 
00:47:42.549 --> 00:47:42.559 align:start position:0%
the executive director for uach
 
00:47:44.190 --> 00:47:44.200 align:start position:0%
therapeutic Equestrian Center in
 
00:47:47.230 --> 00:47:47.240 align:start position:0%
Goffstown New Hampshire and we have been
 
00:47:50.150 --> 00:47:50.160 align:start position:0%
a charity a charity sorry a charitable
 
00:47:52.270 --> 00:47:52.280 align:start position:0%
organization who has been benefiting um
 
00:47:54.270 --> 00:47:54.280 align:start position:0%
through Bingo and Lucky 7 for well over
 
00:47:58.030 --> 00:47:58.040 align:start position:0%
30 years um so I wanted to share some
 
00:48:00.589 --> 00:48:00.599 align:start position:0%
insight from the charity lens um first
 
00:48:03.870 --> 00:48:03.880 align:start position:0%
of all I concur with what um I believe
 
00:48:06.790 --> 00:48:06.800 align:start position:0%
it was Mike had said in the beginning
 
00:48:09.030 --> 00:48:09.040 align:start position:0%
that it is going to be hard to separate
 
00:48:11.069 --> 00:48:11.079 align:start position:0%
the lucky s and the Bingo and it is
 
00:48:13.349 --> 00:48:13.359 align:start position:0%
important that the the rules for gaming
 
00:48:16.630 --> 00:48:16.640 align:start position:0%
Consultants um with respect to Hall
 
00:48:19.349 --> 00:48:19.359 align:start position:0%
managers Etc do overlap and align
 
00:48:21.270 --> 00:48:21.280 align:start position:0%
otherwise there is going to be a
 
00:48:23.309 --> 00:48:23.319 align:start position:0%
division of Duty and
 
00:48:25.790 --> 00:48:25.800 align:start position:0%
responsibility I also want to say that
 
00:48:28.309 --> 00:48:28.319 align:start position:0%
um I recognize the amount of volume uh
 
00:48:30.670 --> 00:48:30.680 align:start position:0%
rule changes and updating takes but I
 
00:48:32.470 --> 00:48:32.480 align:start position:0%
have a copy of the latest Bingo rules
 
00:48:35.750 --> 00:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
that were submitted for draft review for
 
00:48:39.430 --> 00:48:39.440 align:start position:0%
comment um so the current language is
 
00:48:42.670 --> 00:48:42.680 align:start position:0%
different in the currently proposed
 
00:48:44.910 --> 00:48:44.920 align:start position:0%
revisions that are under review for
 
00:48:46.630 --> 00:48:46.640 align:start position:0%
Bingo so we will want to make sure we
 
00:48:50.710 --> 00:48:50.720 align:start position:0%
align those two as a charity that's a
 
00:48:52.789 --> 00:48:52.799 align:start position:0%
small charity but an impactful charity
 
00:48:54.309 --> 00:48:54.319 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire I also
 
00:48:58.030 --> 00:48:58.040 align:start position:0%
feel that there is Clarity and division
 
00:49:00.270 --> 00:49:00.280 align:start position:0%
of Duties and understanding of the
 
00:49:02.430 --> 00:49:02.440 align:start position:0%
perceived conflict of interest in the
 
00:49:04.829 --> 00:49:04.839 align:start position:0%
contracts that are signed when you do
 
00:49:06.390 --> 00:49:06.400 align:start position:0%
business with a charitable gaming
 
00:49:08.230 --> 00:49:08.240 align:start position:0%
consultant and then you have your
 
00:49:09.750 --> 00:49:09.760 align:start position:0%
contract that clearly defines what the
 
00:49:11.430 --> 00:49:11.440 align:start position:0%
roles and responsibilities of the hall
 
00:49:13.630 --> 00:49:13.640 align:start position:0%
and the hall manager are so there is a
 
00:49:16.190 --> 00:49:16.200 align:start position:0%
division of Duty and there is Clarity in
 
00:49:17.829 --> 00:49:17.839 align:start position:0%
the contractual Arrangements that are
 
00:49:20.030 --> 00:49:20.040 align:start position:0%
raised there as an employer um
 
00:49:22.630 --> 00:49:22.640 align:start position:0%
Consulting hiring standpoint so I feel
 
00:49:25.069 --> 00:49:25.079 align:start position:0%
it's important to not dismiss the level
 
00:49:26.910 --> 00:49:26.920 align:start position:0%
of knowledge that a charity brings to
 
00:49:28.710 --> 00:49:28.720 align:start position:0%
the table in understanding employment
 
00:49:31.990 --> 00:49:32.000 align:start position:0%
law and conflict of interest and
 
00:49:33.150 --> 00:49:33.160 align:start position:0%
understanding how they need to measure
 
00:49:35.750 --> 00:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
and mitigate the two I support that the
 
00:49:37.549 --> 00:49:37.559 align:start position:0%
language should clarify that there could
 
00:49:40.549 --> 00:49:40.559 align:start position:0%
be a perceived conflict of interest um I
 
00:49:42.910 --> 00:49:42.920 align:start position:0%
don't think that the rule itself should
 
00:49:46.030 --> 00:49:46.040 align:start position:0%
indicate log keeping or demonstrable
 
00:49:48.150 --> 00:49:48.160 align:start position:0%
what to because there are going to be
 
00:49:50.589 --> 00:49:50.599 align:start position:0%
differences charity to charity um with
 
00:49:52.470 --> 00:49:52.480 align:start position:0%
respect to knowledge about Bingo and
 
00:49:54.430 --> 00:49:54.440 align:start position:0%
what the charity wants to own and their
 
00:49:55.910 --> 00:49:55.920 align:start position:0%
role and responsibility and that should
 
00:49:57.549 --> 00:49:57.559 align:start position:0%
be defined contractually it should not
 
00:50:01.069 --> 00:50:01.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:03.670 --> 00:50:03.680 align:start position:0%
legislation I have
 
00:50:07.670 --> 00:50:07.680 align:start position:0%
been doing business in the charitable
 
00:50:10.190 --> 00:50:10.200 align:start position:0%
gaming world for many years and it's
 
00:50:12.710 --> 00:50:12.720 align:start position:0%
complex and without the support of a
 
00:50:16.230 --> 00:50:16.240 align:start position:0%
hall manager who happens to also be our
 
00:50:17.990 --> 00:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
gaming consultant with the number of
 
00:50:19.670 --> 00:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
years that they have had in the industry
 
00:50:21.190 --> 00:50:21.200 align:start position:0%
to understand the rule making and the
 
00:50:24.470 --> 00:50:24.480 align:start position:0%
rule changes I have never once had a
 
00:50:26.829 --> 00:50:26.839 align:start position:0%
concern that their lens wasn't to
 
00:50:28.829 --> 00:50:28.839 align:start position:0%
benefit the charity rather than
 
00:50:30.589 --> 00:50:30.599 align:start position:0%
themselves in fact they have
 
00:50:32.910 --> 00:50:32.920 align:start position:0%
specifically indicated that they have
 
00:50:36.829 --> 00:50:36.839 align:start position:0%
declined comment or have moved away from
 
00:50:38.990 --> 00:50:39.000 align:start position:0%
legislation that would benefit them as
 
00:50:40.910 --> 00:50:40.920 align:start position:0%
the consultant or the hall manager
 
00:50:42.670 --> 00:50:42.680 align:start position:0%
versus what the overarching good of the
 
00:50:45.150 --> 00:50:45.160 align:start position:0%
charity is and I will just close by
 
00:50:47.309 --> 00:50:47.319 align:start position:0%
reminding everyone that without a
 
00:50:49.789 --> 00:50:49.799 align:start position:0%
charitable organization none of the
 
00:50:52.870 --> 00:50:52.880 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming would happen so it's
 
00:50:55.589 --> 00:50:55.599 align:start position:0%
important to listen to the charity and
 
00:50:57.549 --> 00:50:57.559 align:start position:0%
what the Charity's needs are and how you
 
00:50:59.630 --> 00:50:59.640 align:start position:0%
can support the charitable work through
 
00:51:02.309 --> 00:51:02.319 align:start position:0%
your legislation of charitable
 
00:51:06.470 --> 00:51:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:10.309 --> 00:51:10.319 align:start position:0%
you so so you take exception to your
 
00:51:12.670 --> 00:51:12.680 align:start position:0%
consultant keeping a log of what he did
 
00:51:17.670 --> 00:51:17.680 align:start position:0%
for you the consultant already discloses
 
00:51:19.390 --> 00:51:19.400 align:start position:0%
and clarifies what their rules and
 
00:51:22.230 --> 00:51:22.240 align:start position:0%
responsibility are in our contract for
 
00:51:24.510 --> 00:51:24.520 align:start position:0%
engagement and that should be sufficient
 
00:51:26.990 --> 00:51:27.000 align:start position:0%
without having an overarching or an
 
00:51:30.150 --> 00:51:30.160 align:start position:0%
additional responsibility or task that
 
00:51:32.109 --> 00:51:32.119 align:start position:0%
they need to do I'd rather they focused
 
00:51:34.190 --> 00:51:34.200 align:start position:0%
on doing the task rather than telling me
 
00:51:35.670 --> 00:51:35.680 align:start position:0%
they've done the task that I know that
 
00:51:37.589 --> 00:51:37.599 align:start position:0%
they're doing and it will be evident to
 
00:51:39.789 --> 00:51:39.799 align:start position:0%
me in the outcomes of the reporting and
 
00:51:42.190 --> 00:51:42.200 align:start position:0%
the way B the way Bingo is being run and
 
00:51:44.109 --> 00:51:44.119 align:start position:0%
Lucky 7 is being handled if they are not
 
00:51:45.990 --> 00:51:46.000 align:start position:0%
doing the task they are responsible for
 
00:51:48.750 --> 00:51:48.760 align:start position:0%
doing thank
 
00:51:48.760 --> 00:51:50.630 align:start position:0%
doing thank
you

00:51:50.630 --> 00:51:50.640 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:51:54.950 --> 00:51:54.960 align:start position:0%
good yes you have a you're you yes
 
00:51:54.960 --> 00:52:02.670 align:start position:0%
good yes you have a you're you yes
please

00:52:02.670 --> 00:52:02.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:03.549 --> 00:52:03.559 align:start position:0%
again good
 
00:52:05.470 --> 00:52:05.480 align:start position:0%
morning I think it's important for the
 
00:52:07.230 --> 00:52:07.240 align:start position:0%
committee to realize that the the
 
00:52:09.990 --> 00:52:10.000 align:start position:0%
commercial Hall in a bingo Lucky 7
 
00:52:13.470 --> 00:52:13.480 align:start position:0%
operation has only one form of Revenue
 
00:52:15.230 --> 00:52:15.240 align:start position:0%
they take a collection on the foot
 
00:52:18.150 --> 00:52:18.160 align:start position:0%
traffic they get five to s or $10 per
 
00:52:21.230 --> 00:52:21.240 align:start position:0%
head that's all they get so the conflict
 
00:52:24.829 --> 00:52:24.839 align:start position:0%
of interest um sometimes arises in this
 
00:52:28.030 --> 00:52:28.040 align:start position:0%
bingo commercial lucky S type of a world
 
00:52:29.670 --> 00:52:29.680 align:start position:0%
because there's not enough room for all
 
00:52:32.309 --> 00:52:32.319 align:start position:0%
the Charities so you have Charities that
 
00:52:34.150 --> 00:52:34.160 align:start position:0%
want to get in who can't get in but the
 
00:52:36.349 --> 00:52:36.359 align:start position:0%
commercial only has one Revenue stream
 
00:52:37.829 --> 00:52:37.839 align:start position:0%
so it's hard to find a conflict of
 
00:52:40.109 --> 00:52:40.119 align:start position:0%
interest uh in a financial sense when
 
00:52:42.190 --> 00:52:42.200 align:start position:0%
they can only collect that money so the
 
00:52:43.990 --> 00:52:44.000 align:start position:0%
this whole
 
00:52:47.549 --> 00:52:47.559 align:start position:0%
um new paragraph is kind of based on the
 
00:52:49.150 --> 00:52:49.160 align:start position:0%
inherent conflict of interest which we
 
00:52:51.430 --> 00:52:51.440 align:start position:0%
believe does not exist and again the I
 
00:52:54.470 --> 00:52:54.480 align:start position:0%
think I submitted the lucky uh the um
 
00:52:57.470 --> 00:52:57.480 align:start position:0%
gaming consult in form with my uh
 
00:52:59.789 --> 00:52:59.799 align:start position:0%
comments and you'll notice that not only
 
00:53:01.670 --> 00:53:01.680 align:start position:0%
does it have Bingo lucky s it also has
 
00:53:03.789 --> 00:53:03.799 align:start position:0%
all the particular duties that the
 
00:53:05.390 --> 00:53:05.400 align:start position:0%
consultant is going to do and they check
 
00:53:08.030 --> 00:53:08.040 align:start position:0%
them off bookkeeping this and that it's
 
00:53:10.230 --> 00:53:10.240 align:start position:0%
so it's a um we feel it's a little over
 
00:53:10.240 --> 00:53:11.230 align:start position:0%
so it's a um we feel it's a little over
the

00:53:11.230 --> 00:53:11.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:53:17.030 --> 00:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:19.990 --> 00:53:20.000 align:start position:0%
you all right Miss King you have a
 
00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:23.829 align:start position:0%
you all right Miss King you have a
further

00:53:23.829 --> 00:53:23.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:27.390 --> 00:53:27.400 align:start position:0%
comment hi just want to clarify that the
 
00:53:29.990 --> 00:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
application and the con contract just
 
00:53:33.030 --> 00:53:33.040 align:start position:0%
say the types of Duties they may provide
 
00:53:36.069 --> 00:53:36.079 align:start position:0%
it doesn't actually de detail what was
 
00:53:38.230 --> 00:53:38.240 align:start position:0%
provided and a charity should be able to
 
00:53:40.349 --> 00:53:40.359 align:start position:0%
know what was actually provided on their
 
00:53:42.710 --> 00:53:42.720 align:start position:0%
behalf I'd also like to point out that
 
00:53:45.309 --> 00:53:45.319 align:start position:0%
while there is the one stream for the
 
00:53:48.789 --> 00:53:48.799 align:start position:0%
commercial Hall it's um up to $10 per
 
00:53:51.349 --> 00:53:51.359 align:start position:0%
player that they can receive as rent
 
00:53:54.150 --> 00:53:54.160 align:start position:0%
however if that owner is also a
 
00:53:58.150 --> 00:53:58.160 align:start position:0%
consultant they receive additional
 
00:54:01.309 --> 00:54:01.319 align:start position:0%
Revenue as a consultant and
 
00:54:04.789 --> 00:54:04.799 align:start position:0%
if there has been questions of what
 
00:54:06.910 --> 00:54:06.920 align:start position:0%
services are actually being provided for
 
00:54:09.549 --> 00:54:09.559 align:start position:0%
that consulting
 
00:54:15.710 --> 00:54:15.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:18.910 --> 00:54:18.920 align:start position:0%
you comments
 
00:54:22.630 --> 00:54:22.640 align:start position:0%
concerns gr I'll move what would be the
 
00:54:25.549 --> 00:54:25.559 align:start position:0%
appropriate because I do believe that
 
00:54:28.030 --> 00:54:28.040 align:start position:0%
consultant should confirm what they've
 
00:54:30.390 --> 00:54:30.400 align:start position:0%
done whether or not the evidence is
 
00:54:33.230 --> 00:54:33.240 align:start position:0%
there I think it needs to be done so and
 
00:54:35.990 --> 00:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
that's included in the rules correct the
 
00:54:38.789 --> 00:54:38.799 align:start position:0%
uh that's the detailed log right so it's
 
00:54:40.789 --> 00:54:40.799 align:start position:0%
a conditional approval so I'll move
 
00:54:40.799 --> 00:54:45.670 align:start position:0%
a conditional approval so I'll move
conditional

00:54:45.670 --> 00:54:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:48.390 --> 00:54:48.400 align:start position:0%
approval is that the correct motion is
 
00:54:52.870 --> 00:54:52.880 align:start position:0%
that a would this be a uh full approval
 
00:54:57.190 --> 00:54:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:59.430 --> 00:54:59.440 align:start position:0%
it's it would be a conditional approval
 
00:55:02.750 --> 00:55:02.760 align:start position:0%
a conditional would be if I'm it's
 
00:55:04.950 --> 00:55:04.960 align:start position:0%
currently written that
 
00:55:09.390 --> 00:55:09.400 align:start position:0%
the um only if they're a consultant and
 
00:55:12.829 --> 00:55:12.839 align:start position:0%
a game Hall that they that they do the
 
00:55:15.870 --> 00:55:15.880 align:start position:0%
log I am open to a conditional approval
 
00:55:18.829 --> 00:55:18.839 align:start position:0%
to make the log required for all
 
00:55:21.510 --> 00:55:21.520 align:start position:0%
consultant but currently the final
 
00:55:26.150 --> 00:55:26.160 align:start position:0%
proposal just requires the log for the
 
00:55:28.549 --> 00:55:28.559 align:start position:0%
um uh Consultants who are also
 
00:55:31.309 --> 00:55:31.319 align:start position:0%
associated with the hall oh okay then
 
00:55:33.430 --> 00:55:33.440 align:start position:0%
I'll move to approve regular approval
 
00:55:35.309 --> 00:55:35.319 align:start position:0%
I'll move to approve thank you thank you
 
00:55:37.510 --> 00:55:37.520 align:start position:0%
for the
 
00:55:40.309 --> 00:55:40.319 align:start position:0%
correction okay is there a
 
00:55:46.349 --> 00:55:46.359 align:start position:0%
second hack any discussion comments
 
00:55:49.510 --> 00:55:49.520 align:start position:0%
questions those can I well I'm sorry
 
00:55:53.589 --> 00:55:53.599 align:start position:0%
this is time to discuss so I I guess I
 
00:55:55.549 --> 00:55:55.559 align:start position:0%
wonder if we could ask the could we ask
 
00:55:57.470 --> 00:55:57.480 align:start position:0%
the person that from the Lottery
 
00:55:58.910 --> 00:55:58.920 align:start position:0%
Commission to come up one more time Miss
 
00:56:01.990 --> 00:56:02.000 align:start position:0%
King you know I'm sorry I I have to
 
00:56:04.109 --> 00:56:04.119 align:start position:0%
confess at the outset that I am I really
 
00:56:06.309 --> 00:56:06.319 align:start position:0%
am pretty ignorant about the way all of
 
00:56:09.029 --> 00:56:09.039 align:start position:0%
this stuff works but I'm I just want to
 
00:56:12.910 --> 00:56:12.920 align:start position:0%
as I read the the rule am I
 
00:56:15.789 --> 00:56:15.799 align:start position:0%
understanding that someone can be the
 
00:56:18.230 --> 00:56:18.240 align:start position:0%
owner of a hall where the charitable
 
00:56:20.910 --> 00:56:20.920 align:start position:0%
gaming takes place that's correct right
 
00:56:22.910 --> 00:56:22.920 align:start position:0%
and so I just want to make sure I'm
 
00:56:25.670 --> 00:56:25.680 align:start position:0%
understand how this operates if the
 
00:56:28.029 --> 00:56:28.039 align:start position:0%
you you mentioned that the owner will
 
00:56:31.870 --> 00:56:31.880 align:start position:0%
get a stream of Revenue of uh of rent
 
00:56:33.589 --> 00:56:33.599 align:start position:0%
what do you call rent from from people
 
00:56:36.510 --> 00:56:36.520 align:start position:0%
who come in to gamble right correct all
 
00:56:40.829 --> 00:56:40.839 align:start position:0%
right and then what and then that's the
 
00:56:43.630 --> 00:56:43.640 align:start position:0%
only source of Revenue that the owner
 
00:56:46.950 --> 00:56:46.960 align:start position:0%
gets as the owner if it's he's also a
 
00:56:49.029 --> 00:56:49.039 align:start position:0%
consultant he can receive a consulting
 
00:56:51.829 --> 00:56:51.839 align:start position:0%
fee which has no guidelines on how much
 
00:56:54.190 --> 00:56:54.200 align:start position:0%
can be charged right but does he get
 
00:56:57.829 --> 00:56:57.839 align:start position:0%
does does the owner get any take any
 
00:57:00.870 --> 00:57:00.880 align:start position:0%
percentage of what is gambled no so all
 
00:57:03.710 --> 00:57:03.720 align:start position:0%
of that money goes to the charity or
 
00:57:05.230 --> 00:57:05.240 align:start position:0%
what part goes to the charity and what
 
00:57:06.990 --> 00:57:07.000 align:start position:0%
part goes to who El who who gets the
 
00:57:08.150 --> 00:57:08.160 align:start position:0%
rest of
 
00:57:11.829 --> 00:57:11.839 align:start position:0%
it so from the charity would receive
 
00:57:13.870 --> 00:57:13.880 align:start position:0%
their revenue from Bingo from that the
 
00:57:16.430 --> 00:57:16.440 align:start position:0%
rent would be taken out the Consulting
 
00:57:18.190 --> 00:57:18.200 align:start position:0%
fees would be taken out any
 
00:57:20.029 --> 00:57:20.039 align:start position:0%
reimbursements they have for their
 
00:57:22.309 --> 00:57:22.319 align:start position:0%
member volunteers would be taken out
 
00:57:25.270 --> 00:57:25.280 align:start position:0%
there's also a a certain um and not with
 
00:57:28.029 --> 00:57:28.039 align:start position:0%
Lucky 7 but it with Bingo there would be
 
00:57:30.510 --> 00:57:30.520 align:start position:0%
um a certain tax on certain types of
 
00:57:33.870 --> 00:57:33.880 align:start position:0%
games not in Lucky 7 but um and then
 
00:57:36.390 --> 00:57:36.400 align:start position:0%
what remains is for the
 
00:57:39.150 --> 00:57:39.160 align:start position:0%
charity okay so in other words is other
 
00:57:41.430 --> 00:57:41.440 align:start position:0%
than the expenses that are red that are
 
00:57:43.270 --> 00:57:43.280 align:start position:0%
taken out of the proceeds of the
 
00:57:46.870 --> 00:57:46.880 align:start position:0%
gambling there's all of all of the net
 
00:57:49.069 --> 00:57:49.079 align:start position:0%
after those expenses are taken out goes
 
00:57:51.309 --> 00:57:51.319 align:start position:0%
to the charity there's not some cut that
 
00:57:54.349 --> 00:57:54.359 align:start position:0%
goes to the owner no okay okay all right
 
00:57:56.670 --> 00:57:56.680 align:start position:0%
all right thank thank you for CLA thank
 
00:57:59.510 --> 00:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
you for clarifying
 
00:58:01.589 --> 00:58:01.599 align:start position:0%
that if I could just follow with the
 
00:58:04.510 --> 00:58:04.520 align:start position:0%
comment on that um I know from my time
 
00:58:06.230 --> 00:58:06.240 align:start position:0%
serving on ways and means in the house
 
00:58:08.069 --> 00:58:08.079 align:start position:0%
that um the interest there's an
 
00:58:10.190 --> 00:58:10.200 align:start position:0%
interesting breakdown like a wheel that
 
00:58:12.309 --> 00:58:12.319 align:start position:0%
the Lottery Commission provides us to
 
00:58:13.910 --> 00:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
show us that breakdown exactly that
 
00:58:16.309 --> 00:58:16.319 align:start position:0%
you're talking about the the charitable
 
00:58:20.230 --> 00:58:20.240 align:start position:0%
um distribution um it's it ends up to be
 
00:58:22.470 --> 00:58:22.480 align:start position:0%
something like 133% I think the
 
00:58:23.990 --> 00:58:24.000 align:start position:0%
Charities take home something like that
 
00:58:26.029 --> 00:58:26.039 align:start position:0%
it depends upon what game you're looking
 
00:58:29.109 --> 00:58:29.119 align:start position:0%
at um the wheel was probably more
 
00:58:31.390 --> 00:58:31.400 align:start position:0%
associated with um games of chance and
 
00:58:32.430 --> 00:58:32.440 align:start position:0%
historical question I think that is
 
00:58:36.109 --> 00:58:36.119 align:start position:0%
correct um thank you for reminding me
 
00:58:38.990 --> 00:58:39.000 align:start position:0%
yes and I'd like to mention there are
 
00:58:42.109 --> 00:58:42.119 align:start position:0%
great many small Charities that don't
 
00:58:44.750 --> 00:58:44.760 align:start position:0%
have the people that
 
00:58:47.150 --> 00:58:47.160 align:start position:0%
can deal with this and having a
 
00:58:49.870 --> 00:58:49.880 align:start position:0%
consultant might be very
 
00:58:53.309 --> 00:58:53.319 align:start position:0%
worthwhile so any further comments
 
00:58:58.549 --> 00:58:58.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:00.870 --> 00:59:00.880 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so it seems very
 
00:59:03.349 --> 00:59:03.359 align:start position:0%
clear from the discussion that that when
 
00:59:05.789 --> 00:59:05.799 align:start position:0%
you have that a lot of this
 
00:59:09.430 --> 00:59:09.440 align:start position:0%
is not so much written down as when you
 
00:59:11.549 --> 00:59:11.559 align:start position:0%
have people who are very knowledgeable
 
00:59:14.349 --> 00:59:14.359 align:start position:0%
very expert very
 
00:59:17.549 --> 00:59:17.559 align:start position:0%
experienced as in life so often it works
 
00:59:19.309 --> 00:59:19.319 align:start position:0%
a lot better because it's not all
 
00:59:24.270 --> 00:59:24.280 align:start position:0%
written down it is learned and skilled
 
00:59:26.990 --> 00:59:27.000 align:start position:0%
play ERS and the skilled not literally
 
00:59:29.230 --> 00:59:29.240 align:start position:0%
the players but uh players in the
 
00:59:32.670 --> 00:59:32.680 align:start position:0%
colloquial sense uh they they make it
 
00:59:34.910 --> 00:59:34.920 align:start position:0%
work much better than having it all
 
00:59:34.920 --> 00:59:35.990 align:start position:0%
work much better than having it all
written

00:59:35.990 --> 00:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
written
 
00:59:38.510 --> 00:59:38.520 align:start position:0%
down because then it's kind of like it
 
00:59:41.150 --> 00:59:41.160 align:start position:0%
all works unless it's a Tuesday right
 
00:59:45.109 --> 00:59:45.119 align:start position:0%
thank you representative sh any other
 
00:59:45.119 --> 00:59:48.109 align:start position:0%
thank you representative sh any other
comments

00:59:48.109 --> 00:59:48.119 align:start position:0%
comments
 
00:59:53.630 --> 00:59:53.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:53.640 --> 00:59:57.670 align:start position:0%
 
ma'am

00:59:57.670 --> 00:59:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:59.510 --> 00:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
while I understand the heart and the
 
01:00:01.910 --> 01:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
intention I think it's important to note
 
01:00:06.630 --> 01:00:06.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:09.789 --> 01:00:09.799 align:start position:0%
license there's nothing in the gaming
 
01:00:12.910 --> 01:00:12.920 align:start position:0%
consultant license that proves any true
 
01:00:16.029 --> 01:00:16.039 align:start position:0%
history or competency for being able to
 
01:00:18.470 --> 01:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
run the
 
01:00:21.950 --> 01:00:21.960 align:start position:0%
game so by just having a licensed gaming
 
01:00:25.390 --> 01:00:25.400 align:start position:0%
consultant it does not necessarily give
 
01:00:27.150 --> 01:00:27.160 align:start position:0%
a charitable
 
01:00:30.230 --> 01:00:30.240 align:start position:0%
organization any benefit on their
 
01:00:32.710 --> 01:00:32.720 align:start position:0%
knowledge of the Bingo rules and the
 
01:00:35.270 --> 01:00:35.280 align:start position:0%
lucky s rules and laws and how a game
 
01:00:37.069 --> 01:00:37.079 align:start position:0%
should be effectively run to support the
 
01:00:39.549 --> 01:00:39.559 align:start position:0%
charity and stay in compliance
 
01:00:42.430 --> 01:00:42.440 align:start position:0%
with we have been fortunate that because
 
01:00:44.109 --> 01:00:44.119 align:start position:0%
our hall
 
01:00:47.309 --> 01:00:47.319 align:start position:0%
manager as well not owner but hall
 
01:00:50.589 --> 01:00:50.599 align:start position:0%
manager as well as also a gaming
 
01:00:54.109 --> 01:00:54.119 align:start position:0%
consultant to provide us the best depth
 
01:00:57.910 --> 01:00:57.920 align:start position:0%
and coverage to make sure the charity is
 
01:00:57.920 --> 01:00:59.549 align:start position:0%
and coverage to make sure the charity is
protected

01:00:59.549 --> 01:00:59.559 align:start position:0%
protected
 
01:01:02.150 --> 01:01:02.160 align:start position:0%
again I think it's important to note
 
01:01:03.670 --> 01:01:03.680 align:start position:0%
that there needs to still be
 
01:01:05.910 --> 01:01:05.920 align:start position:0%
responsibility on behalf of each of the
 
01:01:09.390 --> 01:01:09.400 align:start position:0%
Charities to understand as we would with
 
01:01:11.870 --> 01:01:11.880 align:start position:0%
any of our business understand who we're
 
01:01:15.309 --> 01:01:15.319 align:start position:0%
doing business with is it effective is
 
01:01:17.950 --> 01:01:17.960 align:start position:0%
it cost efficient is it legally and
 
01:01:21.309 --> 01:01:21.319 align:start position:0%
morally and ethically correct there is
 
01:01:23.549 --> 01:01:23.559 align:start position:0%
responsibility for the charity to do
 
01:01:26.150 --> 01:01:26.160 align:start position:0%
that and I feel like it's an overreach
 
01:01:28.829 --> 01:01:28.839 align:start position:0%
for the Lottery Commission to expect
 
01:01:31.430 --> 01:01:31.440 align:start position:0%
that we don't know and that we're we're
 
01:01:33.589 --> 01:01:33.599 align:start position:0%
uninformed and we can't manage that
 
01:01:35.870 --> 01:01:35.880 align:start position:0%
piece of our business so again I stand
 
01:01:38.390 --> 01:01:38.400 align:start position:0%
in clarifying that there is a perceived
 
01:01:40.510 --> 01:01:40.520 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest that should be
 
01:01:43.630 --> 01:01:43.640 align:start position:0%
mitigated take out demonstrable and then
 
01:01:45.470 --> 01:01:45.480 align:start position:0%
it's the responsibility of the charity
 
01:01:47.190 --> 01:01:47.200 align:start position:0%
to do
 
01:01:50.470 --> 01:01:50.480 align:start position:0%
that thank you for your for your
 
01:01:53.430 --> 01:01:53.440 align:start position:0%
testimony anyone any other comments
 
01:01:57.029 --> 01:01:57.039 align:start position:0%
questions so the only the only I mean I
 
01:01:59.349 --> 01:01:59.359 align:start position:0%
was going to say I I'm I mean I'm I am
 
01:02:01.230 --> 01:02:01.240 align:start position:0%
going to support the motion the motion
 
01:02:02.829 --> 01:02:02.839 align:start position:0%
that's been made the only thing I would
 
01:02:05.750 --> 01:02:05.760 align:start position:0%
say is I do think Mr mlin has a has a
 
01:02:08.589 --> 01:02:08.599 align:start position:0%
point that the language of demon take
 
01:02:11.109 --> 01:02:11.119 align:start position:0%
demonstrable steps that is you know it
 
01:02:12.230 --> 01:02:12.240 align:start position:0%
seems to me it is a little bit
 
01:02:15.230 --> 01:02:15.240 align:start position:0%
wishy-washy but nonetheless I think the
 
01:02:19.710 --> 01:02:19.720 align:start position:0%
point is is a good one and you know I I
 
01:02:22.470 --> 01:02:22.480 align:start position:0%
I I hadn't heard nobody said Mr mcclin
 
01:02:24.510 --> 01:02:24.520 align:start position:0%
didn't say nobody else said that that
 
01:02:27.510 --> 01:02:27.520 align:start position:0%
that for example Mr mlin came to you and
 
01:02:30.150 --> 01:02:30.160 align:start position:0%
said instead of using this language here
 
01:02:31.990 --> 01:02:32.000 align:start position:0%
would be some more specific language
 
01:02:34.589 --> 01:02:34.599 align:start position:0%
that we think is good I didn't hear that
 
01:02:37.230 --> 01:02:37.240 align:start position:0%
um and so in the absence of that I you
 
01:02:40.549 --> 01:02:40.559 align:start position:0%
know I I think this is is good enough so
 
01:02:43.269 --> 01:02:43.279 align:start position:0%
to speak so I'm prepar to support it
 
01:02:43.279 --> 01:02:49.910 align:start position:0%
to speak so I'm prepar to support it

Indulgence we the uh Department of
Justice

01:11:24.590 --> 01:11:24.600 align:start position:0%
Justice
 
01:11:27.030 --> 01:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
um so this is
 
01:11:28.910 --> 01:11:28.920 align:start position:0%
2023 uh
 
01:11:32.310 --> 01:11:32.320 align:start position:0%
239 and I have a couple notes to the
 
01:11:34.229 --> 01:11:34.239 align:start position:0%
committee on this one I wasn't sure if
 
01:11:35.870 --> 01:11:35.880 align:start position:0%
the committee wanted to hear each of
 
01:11:37.430 --> 01:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
them or if you just wanted to deal with
 
01:11:40.709 --> 01:11:40.719 align:start position:0%
the one substantive comment let's start
 
01:11:43.390 --> 01:11:43.400 align:start position:0%
with that okay so the only substantive
 
01:11:46.430 --> 01:11:46.440 align:start position:0%
comment I have um after the agency
 
01:11:49.030 --> 01:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
submitted a conditional approval request
 
01:11:52.270 --> 01:11:52.280 align:start position:0%
was uh edit unclear on page four of the
 
01:11:54.070 --> 01:11:54.080 align:start position:0%
conditional approval request
 
01:11:57.189 --> 01:11:57.199 align:start position:0%
text uh the agency had put a requirement
 
01:12:00.910 --> 01:12:00.920 align:start position:0%
in the rule text for a dissolution
 
01:12:03.550 --> 01:12:03.560 align:start position:0%
provision but they put it in the wrong
 
01:12:05.910 --> 01:12:05.920 align:start position:0%
section on the wrong form it should have
 
01:12:09.750 --> 01:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
been on form NC
 
01:12:17.590 --> 01:12:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:21.870 align:start position:0%
 
402.4903

01:12:21.870 --> 01:12:21.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:26.669 --> 01:12:26.679 align:start position:0%
CA C1 a so the conditional approval
 
01:12:29.149 --> 01:12:29.159 align:start position:0%
request can be orally amended to just
 
01:12:31.310 --> 01:12:31.320 align:start position:0%
change that to the correct section and
 
01:12:33.070 --> 01:12:33.080 align:start position:0%
then after that I didn't have any
 
01:12:35.910 --> 01:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
substantive comments I just had um some
 
01:12:38.830 --> 01:12:38.840 align:start position:0%
informational comments for the committee
 
01:12:42.229 --> 01:12:42.239 align:start position:0%
um all right thank
 
01:12:44.270 --> 01:12:44.280 align:start position:0%

01:12:46.189 --> 01:12:46.199 align:start position:0%

Department of Justice um as attorney
 
01:12:55.709 --> 01:12:55.719 align:start position:0%
card had mentioned um Our intention was
 
01:12:58.390 --> 01:12:58.400 align:start position:0%
to adopt all of the comments that um she
 
01:13:00.470 --> 01:13:00.480 align:start position:0%
had made on our final proposal I just
 
01:13:02.910 --> 01:13:02.920 align:start position:0%
made the change to the wrong section on
 
01:13:05.350 --> 01:13:05.360 align:start position:0%
one of them so we would request to amend
 
01:13:06.669 --> 01:13:06.679 align:start position:0%
that conditional approval to make the
 
01:13:09.189 --> 01:13:09.199 align:start position:0%
change in the correct location all right
 
01:13:13.310 --> 01:13:13.320 align:start position:0%
that's very good to know any comments
 
01:13:15.790 --> 01:13:15.800 align:start position:0%

seems fine so I just wanted to yeah I'm
 
01:13:31.510 --> 01:13:31.520 align:start position:0%
glancing at one of them it says that the
 
01:13:34.070 --> 01:13:34.080 align:start position:0%
you need to update the date well that's
 
01:13:35.669 --> 01:13:35.679 align:start position:0%
that will
 
01:13:39.030 --> 01:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
happen all right representative Len no I
 
01:13:41.590 --> 01:13:41.600 align:start position:0%
I I just made the motion to to approve
 
01:13:44.270 --> 01:13:44.280 align:start position:0%
it all right that's the conditional
 
01:13:46.750 --> 01:13:46.760 align:start position:0%
approval with the uh staff comments and
 
01:13:46.760 --> 01:13:47.870 align:start position:0%
approval with the uh staff comments and
the

01:13:47.870 --> 01:13:47.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:13:50.390 --> 01:13:50.400 align:start position:0%
additional reference
 
01:13:54.510 --> 01:13:54.520 align:start position:0%
correction okay Mary you seconded
 
01:13:58.390 --> 01:13:58.400 align:start position:0%
okay any comments
 
01:14:00.629 --> 01:14:00.639 align:start position:0%
questions okay seeing none those in
 
01:14:03.350 --> 01:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
favor I
 
01:14:07.270 --> 01:14:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:09.590 --> 01:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
much is there anyone here from oh yes
 
01:14:12.470 --> 01:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
there is someone from agriculture
 
01:14:17.510 --> 01:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
excellent okay this is uh 2022 or 2023
 
01:14:20.590 --> 01:14:20.600 align:start position:0%
243 on acquisition of agricultural land
 
01:14:23.350 --> 01:14:23.360 align:start position:0%
development rights and there's one com
 
01:14:25.870 --> 01:14:25.880 align:start position:0%
comment and it's an unclear wording
 
01:14:28.590 --> 01:14:28.600 align:start position:0%
comment because the rule requires the
 
01:14:30.669 --> 01:14:30.679 align:start position:0%
owner of the site to submit a request
 
01:14:32.669 --> 01:14:32.679 align:start position:0%
for approval for construction or
 
01:14:35.270 --> 01:14:35.280 align:start position:0%
alteration to the commissioner but the
 
01:14:38.110 --> 01:14:38.120 align:start position:0%
next paragraph states that it is it it
 
01:14:40.149 --> 01:14:40.159 align:start position:0%
is the committee who will hold the
 
01:14:41.870 --> 01:14:41.880 align:start position:0%
public hearing and make the decision on
 
01:14:43.750 --> 01:14:43.760 align:start position:0%
the approval so it's
 
01:14:46.110 --> 01:14:46.120 align:start position:0%
unclear why the request is submitted to
 
01:14:48.510 --> 01:14:48.520 align:start position:0%
the commissioner and if the commissioner
 
01:14:50.669 --> 01:14:50.679 align:start position:0%
remains involved in the decision making
 
01:14:52.870 --> 01:14:52.880 align:start position:0%
and it really is a matter of the the
 
01:14:54.669 --> 01:14:54.679 align:start position:0%
person is already submitting this to the
 
01:14:57.470 --> 01:14:57.480 align:start position:0%
commissioner and to the municipality so
 
01:14:59.910 --> 01:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
why would they not also submit it to the
 
01:15:02.669 --> 01:15:02.679 align:start position:0%
committee um it's it's just an unclear
 
01:15:05.750 --> 01:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
written uh like paragraph so that's my
 
01:15:09.310 --> 01:15:09.320 align:start position:0%
only comment on this all right thank
 
01:15:12.590 --> 01:15:12.600 align:start position:0%
you good morning um committee Patricia
 
01:15:14.990 --> 01:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
Benner for the Department of Agriculture
 
01:15:19.709 --> 01:15:19.719 align:start position:0%
markets and food um and I can clarify
 
01:15:23.550 --> 01:15:23.560 align:start position:0%
that by saying that um in the definition
 
01:15:26.870 --> 01:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
the commissioner is the chairperson for
 
01:15:29.709 --> 01:15:29.719 align:start position:0%
the committee so what the rule is saying
 
01:15:33.070 --> 01:15:33.080 align:start position:0%
is that the commissioner receives the
 
01:15:36.070 --> 01:15:36.080 align:start position:0%
request and then but the public hearing
 
01:15:39.110 --> 01:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
is held by the committee so that's the
 
01:15:42.310 --> 01:15:42.320 align:start position:0%
distinction um so with that
 
01:15:46.229 --> 01:15:46.239 align:start position:0%
clarification um we're okay with the
 
01:15:47.750 --> 01:15:47.760 align:start position:0%
rest of the comments so that
 
01:15:50.110 --> 01:15:50.120 align:start position:0%
clarification it's the the request goes
 
01:15:52.709 --> 01:15:52.719 align:start position:0%
to the commissioner in His function as
 
01:15:55.550 --> 01:15:55.560 align:start position:0%
chair of the commission if that makes
 
01:15:59.910 --> 01:15:59.920 align:start position:0%
more sense conclude that that
 
01:16:03.470 --> 01:16:03.480 align:start position:0%
language clear no that the the
 
01:16:05.830 --> 01:16:05.840 align:start position:0%
explanation makes the current language
 
01:16:09.229 --> 01:16:09.239 align:start position:0%
make sense now okay thank you are there
 
01:16:12.189 --> 01:16:12.199 align:start position:0%
any other questions or comments from the
 
01:16:16.550 --> 01:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:20.390 --> 01:16:20.400 align:start position:0%
motion I'll move to approve second okay
 
01:16:23.750 --> 01:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
seconded by Senator Ward
 
01:16:23.760 --> 01:16:26.550 align:start position:0%
seconded by Senator Ward
any

01:16:26.550 --> 01:16:26.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:30.310 --> 01:16:30.320 align:start position:0%
discussion all right those in favor I
 
01:16:33.310 --> 01:16:33.320 align:start position:0%
opposed and and thank you for uh
 
01:16:36.030 --> 01:16:36.040 align:start position:0%
clarifying that I trust we had a waiver
 
01:16:38.510 --> 01:16:38.520 align:start position:0%
when we postponed it to this
 
01:16:40.790 --> 01:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
meeting okay thank
 
01:16:43.790 --> 01:16:43.800 align:start position:0%
you all
 
01:16:46.830 --> 01:16:46.840 align:start position:0%
right on to Senator production and
 
01:16:51.550 --> 01:16:51.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:54.510 --> 01:16:54.520 align:start position:0%
food right this is 2023
 
01:16:58.310 --> 01:16:58.320 align:start position:0%
256 and the only issue I have is uh it's
 
01:17:02.830 --> 01:17:02.840 align:start position:0%
a legislative intent um because the
 
01:17:06.750 --> 01:17:06.760 align:start position:0%
statute um States exemptions and it does
 
01:17:09.270 --> 01:17:09.280 align:start position:0%
not include retail food stores in the
 
01:17:11.390 --> 01:17:11.400 align:start position:0%
Exempted Homestead food
 
01:17:14.790 --> 01:17:14.800 align:start position:0%
operation but um another statute
 
01:17:16.910 --> 01:17:16.920 align:start position:0%
excludes the retail stores from
 
01:17:19.830 --> 01:17:19.840 align:start position:0%
licensing so it's it's like it excludes
 
01:17:22.189 --> 01:17:22.199 align:start position:0%
it in one place and then doesn't exclude
 
01:17:23.990 --> 01:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
it in another place
 
01:17:26.110 --> 01:17:26.120 align:start position:0%
um and so it's a little confusing so it
 
01:17:29.149 --> 01:17:29.159 align:start position:0%
really this needs a legislative fix is
 
01:17:29.159 --> 01:17:30.950 align:start position:0%
really this needs a legislative fix is
the

01:17:30.950 --> 01:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:17:34.470 --> 01:17:34.480 align:start position:0%
issue all right thank you good morning
 
01:17:36.229 --> 01:17:36.239 align:start position:0%
Allison radme administrator for the
 
01:17:37.430 --> 01:17:37.440 align:start position:0%
administrative rules unit at the
 
01:17:39.750 --> 01:17:39.760 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human
 
01:17:42.310 --> 01:17:42.320 align:start position:0%
Services good morning Colleen Smith
 
01:17:43.870 --> 01:17:43.880 align:start position:0%
administrator for the food protection
 
01:17:45.390 --> 01:17:45.400 align:start position:0%
section within the Department of Health
 
01:17:47.270 --> 01:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
and Human
 
01:17:47.280 --> 01:17:51.990 align:start position:0%
and Human
Services

01:17:51.990 --> 01:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:55.510 --> 01:17:55.520 align:start position:0%
okay so if you could explain the uh the
 
01:17:58.950 --> 01:17:58.960 align:start position:0%
concern sure so I think it it was a a
 
01:18:00.790 --> 01:18:00.800 align:start position:0%
oversight when that legislation was
 
01:18:04.510 --> 01:18:04.520 align:start position:0%
passed in 2015 that the other reference
 
01:18:07.990 --> 01:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
to an exempt Homestead wasn't corrected
 
01:18:09.910 --> 01:18:09.920 align:start position:0%
um there would be an opportunity in this
 
01:18:11.830 --> 01:18:11.840 align:start position:0%
legislative session because there is a
 
01:18:16.110 --> 01:18:16.120 align:start position:0%
bill HB 1565 that is amending the
 
01:18:20.149 --> 01:18:20.159 align:start position:0%
homestead rule or sorry law so we could
 
01:18:21.669 --> 01:18:21.679 align:start position:0%
possibly make that fix in this
 
01:18:23.709 --> 01:18:23.719 align:start position:0%
legislative session with an Amendment to
 
01:18:27.030 --> 01:18:27.040 align:start position:0%
the that bill okay that be good that
 
01:18:28.550 --> 01:18:28.560 align:start position:0%
would thank
 
01:18:30.510 --> 01:18:30.520 align:start position:0%
you all
 
01:18:33.149 --> 01:18:33.159 align:start position:0%
right so may I ask what the bill number
 
01:18:34.790 --> 01:18:34.800 align:start position:0%
was again
 
01:18:37.110 --> 01:18:37.120 align:start position:0%
1565 was what I
 
01:18:40.669 --> 01:18:40.679 align:start position:0%
heard I heard too and that
 
01:18:44.350 --> 01:18:44.360 align:start position:0%
is presum well we can find it Madam
 
01:18:46.750 --> 01:18:46.760 align:start position:0%
chairperson yes yeah we had this in in
 
01:18:49.430 --> 01:18:49.440 align:start position:0%
Carmer just uh couple weeks ago and or
 
01:18:51.110 --> 01:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
last week I think and they fixed a
 
01:18:52.149 --> 01:18:52.159 align:start position:0%
section on dealing with bed and
 
01:18:53.950 --> 01:18:53.960 align:start position:0%
breakfast anyway as far as snacks was
 
01:18:55.830 --> 01:18:55.840 align:start position:0%
concerned because that was something
 
01:18:57.070 --> 01:18:57.080 align:start position:0%
that they weren't allowed to give a
 
01:18:59.590 --> 01:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
snack after lunchtime you
 
01:19:03.910 --> 01:19:03.920 align:start position:0%
know okay so be careful so
 
01:19:05.910 --> 01:19:05.920 align:start position:0%
representative grassy is that bill still
 
01:19:08.030 --> 01:19:08.040 align:start position:0%
in the possession of the committee if
 
01:19:10.669 --> 01:19:10.679 align:start position:0%
I'm if I remember correctly yes it is
 
01:19:13.390 --> 01:19:13.400 align:start position:0%
all right in that case I would move to
 
01:19:15.709 --> 01:19:15.719 align:start position:0%
approve the rule with the recommendation
 
01:19:18.470 --> 01:19:18.480 align:start position:0%
that the department work with
 
01:19:20.350 --> 01:19:20.360 align:start position:0%
representative grassy to make the
 
01:19:24.510 --> 01:19:24.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate legislative fix
 
01:19:25.709 --> 01:19:25.719 align:start position:0%
is there a
 
01:19:28.270 --> 01:19:28.280 align:start position:0%
second representative Schmidt is
 
01:19:30.709 --> 01:19:30.719 align:start position:0%
seconding any further discussion
 
01:19:33.709 --> 01:19:33.719 align:start position:0%
comments questions representative Lynn
 
01:19:36.830 --> 01:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
no no no I'm just getting ready to vote
 
01:19:39.149 --> 01:19:39.159 align:start position:0%
ah okay and that I don't
 
01:19:42.550 --> 01:19:42.560 align:start position:0%
know in that case the motion is to
 
01:19:45.990 --> 01:19:46.000 align:start position:0%
approve with the legislative fix those
 
01:19:48.350 --> 01:19:48.360 align:start position:0%
in favor I
 
01:19:50.990 --> 01:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
opposed all right thank you very
 
01:19:55.070 --> 01:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:57.310 --> 01:19:57.320 align:start position:0%
representative the Board of

Education okay this is an interim rule
 
01:20:00.199 --> 01:20:01.310 align:start position:0%
Education okay this is an interim rule
uh

01:20:01.310 --> 01:20:01.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:20:05.950 --> 01:20:05.960 align:start position:0%
224-1 uh for visual arts teachers and um

there has been a conditional approval
 
01:20:10.550 --> 01:20:10.560 align:start position:0%
filed the only issue that remains with
 
01:20:12.910 --> 01:20:12.920 align:start position:0%
the rules is that they just expired on
 
01:20:16.390 --> 01:20:16.400 align:start position:0%
January 17th and so the agency filed an
 
01:20:18.750 --> 01:20:18.760 align:start position:0%
in rule to minimize the time period in
 
01:20:21.910 --> 01:20:21.920 align:start position:0%
which the rules um were expired and um
 
01:20:24.470 --> 01:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
that's the only common I have on this
 
01:20:26.640 --> 01:20:26.650 align:start position:0%
proposal okay this is this
 
01:20:26.650 --> 01:20:31.149 align:start position:0%

you all right and back to
 
01:21:32.709 --> 01:21:32.719 align:start position:0%
safety yes so this is um the objection
 
01:21:35.790 --> 01:21:35.800 align:start position:0%
response for 2023 72 which is the
 
01:21:39.990 --> 01:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
watercraft safety rules um after
 
01:21:42.149 --> 01:21:42.159 align:start position:0%
reviewing the objection response I did
 
01:21:44.149 --> 01:21:44.159 align:start position:0%
still have a number of substantive
 
01:21:46.669 --> 01:21:46.679 align:start position:0%
comments I had a very long discussion
 
01:21:49.430 --> 01:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
with the Department um yesterday or the
 
01:21:52.390 --> 01:21:52.400 align:start position:0%
day before where we discussed how some
 
01:21:54.070 --> 01:21:54.080 align:start position:0%
of the may be resolved but there still
 
01:21:57.390 --> 01:21:57.400 align:start position:0%
are some outstanding issues some that
 
01:22:00.390 --> 01:22:00.400 align:start position:0%
might need a legislative fix um the
 
01:22:03.390 --> 01:22:03.400 align:start position:0%
first is on page three of the objection
 
01:22:07.030 --> 01:22:07.040 align:start position:0%
response text it's an unclear comment um
 
01:22:08.910 --> 01:22:08.920 align:start position:0%
this is one of the ones the
 
01:22:11.189 --> 01:22:11.199 align:start position:0%
department represented that should they
 
01:22:13.229 --> 01:22:13.239 align:start position:0%
ask for a revised objection response
 
01:22:15.229 --> 01:22:15.239 align:start position:0%
that they would just delete this
 
01:22:17.229 --> 01:22:17.239 align:start position:0%
language from the role text which would
 
01:22:21.669 --> 01:22:21.679 align:start position:0%
address the comment because they have uh
 
01:22:23.110 --> 01:22:23.120 align:start position:0%
language in there that is not rule
 
01:22:25.790 --> 01:22:25.800 align:start position:0%
language uh they had changed the
 
01:22:28.070 --> 01:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
language from recommendations which is
 
01:22:30.390 --> 01:22:30.400 align:start position:0%
not rule language to for informational
 
01:22:32.709 --> 01:22:32.719 align:start position:0%
purposes only which is also not rule
 
01:22:35.390 --> 01:22:35.400 align:start position:0%
language so just deleting that from the
 
01:22:38.669 --> 01:22:38.679 align:start position:0%
text would address uh my comment as it's
 
01:22:41.070 --> 01:22:41.080 align:start position:0%
not something substantive that is needed
 
01:22:42.790 --> 01:22:42.800 align:start position:0%
for the rule it's not a requirement so
 
01:22:45.910 --> 01:22:45.920 align:start position:0%
taking it out will not be a problem the
 
01:22:47.990 --> 01:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
next is on page five it's an unclear
 
01:22:51.550 --> 01:22:51.560 align:start position:0%
legislative intent comment um the
 
01:22:54.149 --> 01:22:54.159 align:start position:0%
statute specific ically
 
01:22:57.709 --> 01:22:57.719 align:start position:0%
exempts people who possess a valid
 
01:23:00.510 --> 01:23:00.520 align:start position:0%
license issued by the federal government
 
01:23:04.110 --> 01:23:04.120 align:start position:0%
from complying with the requirements for
 
01:23:06.790 --> 01:23:06.800 align:start position:0%
a commercial boating
 
01:23:08.750 --> 01:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
license and
 
01:23:11.310 --> 01:23:11.320 align:start position:0%
specifically exempts them from passing
 
01:23:14.189 --> 01:23:14.199 align:start position:0%
an examination administered by the
 
01:23:17.110 --> 01:23:17.120 align:start position:0%
department in this rule text the
 
01:23:20.189 --> 01:23:20.199 align:start position:0%
department is adding in a practical
 
01:23:23.390 --> 01:23:23.400 align:start position:0%
examination in addition to a written
 
01:23:25.470 --> 01:23:25.480 align:start position:0%
examination the written examination was
 
01:23:27.510 --> 01:23:27.520 align:start position:0%
in the rules previously and that's what
 
01:23:32.070 --> 01:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
was Exempted from uh what the exemption
 
01:23:35.790 --> 01:23:35.800 align:start position:0%
applied to however now we have two tests
 
01:23:37.189 --> 01:23:37.199 align:start position:0%
that are administered by the department
 
01:23:39.310 --> 01:23:39.320 align:start position:0%
and it's not clear if the legislative
 
01:23:42.390 --> 01:23:42.400 align:start position:0%
intent was to exempt these people who
 
01:23:45.270 --> 01:23:45.280 align:start position:0%
have Federal licenses from both these
 
01:23:49.149 --> 01:23:49.159 align:start position:0%
exams as the statutes from 2009 this is
 
01:23:51.830 --> 01:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
a new requirement in the rules um
 
01:23:53.430 --> 01:23:53.440 align:start position:0%
however in talk with the Department it
 
01:23:54.830 --> 01:23:54.840 align:start position:0%
seems as though this practical
 
01:23:56.550 --> 01:23:56.560 align:start position:0%
examination has been something that
 
01:23:58.709 --> 01:23:58.719 align:start position:0%
they've been doing even though it's not
 
01:24:01.870 --> 01:24:01.880 align:start position:0%
in the rule text and it may have dated
 
01:24:04.229 --> 01:24:04.239 align:start position:0%
back to 2009 so if it's a practice
 
01:24:06.870 --> 01:24:06.880 align:start position:0%
that's been implemented since 2009 once
 
01:24:08.830 --> 01:24:08.840 align:start position:0%
again there's a issue of legislative
 
01:24:12.189 --> 01:24:12.199 align:start position:0%
intent of what exactly is being Exempted
 
01:24:15.950 --> 01:24:15.960 align:start position:0%
so for the purposes of these rules even
 
01:24:18.590 --> 01:24:18.600 align:start position:0%
though it's it's past bad behavior that
 
01:24:20.270 --> 01:24:20.280 align:start position:0%
obviously we don't condone it's not
 
01:24:22.030 --> 01:24:22.040 align:start position:0%
something objectionable at this time in
 
01:24:24.110 --> 01:24:24.120 align:start position:0%
fact prefer it to be in the rules at
 
01:24:25.990 --> 01:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
this time it's just whether the statute
 
01:24:28.950 --> 01:24:28.960 align:start position:0%
needs to be fixed to clarify what is
 
01:24:30.950 --> 01:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
being Exempted because the
 
01:24:32.910 --> 01:24:32.920 align:start position:0%
Department's position is that the
 
01:24:35.510 --> 01:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
Practical exam is not Exempted that is
 
01:24:37.669 --> 01:24:37.679 align:start position:0%
something these individuals will have to
 
01:24:39.390 --> 01:24:39.400 align:start position:0%
take even though they don't have to take
 
01:24:40.629 --> 01:24:40.639 align:start position:0%
the written
 
01:24:43.310 --> 01:24:43.320 align:start position:0%
exam the next comment's on page eight
 
01:24:45.109 --> 01:24:45.119 align:start position:0%
it's an unclear legislative intent
 
01:24:47.590 --> 01:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
comment about not using the statutory
 
01:24:51.550 --> 01:24:51.560 align:start position:0%
definition for a raft um this is a
 
01:24:51.560 --> 01:24:52.910 align:start position:0%
definition for a raft um this is a
technicality

01:24:52.910 --> 01:24:52.920 align:start position:0%
technicality
 
01:24:56.390 --> 01:24:56.400 align:start position:0%
as the manual requires agencies to use
 
01:24:58.350 --> 01:24:58.360 align:start position:0%
the statutory definition when there is a
 
01:24:58.360 --> 01:24:59.550 align:start position:0%
the statutory definition when there is a
statutory

01:24:59.550 --> 01:24:59.560 align:start position:0%
statutory
 
01:25:02.990 --> 01:25:03.000 align:start position:0%
definition in this case the agency does
 
01:25:05.709 --> 01:25:05.719 align:start position:0%
use the statutory definition in the
 
01:25:08.390 --> 01:25:08.400 align:start position:0%
first section that has definitions but
 
01:25:11.270 --> 01:25:11.280 align:start position:0%
this limited section they expand on that
 
01:25:15.149 --> 01:25:15.159 align:start position:0%
definition it's to put lights on rafts
 
01:25:19.470 --> 01:25:19.480 align:start position:0%
which they Define as um something more
 
01:25:22.870 --> 01:25:22.880 align:start position:0%
than what the statutory definition is
 
01:25:26.189 --> 01:25:26.199 align:start position:0%
the committee could not object if it
 
01:25:28.470 --> 01:25:28.480 align:start position:0%
feels as though this is an
 
01:25:31.790 --> 01:25:31.800 align:start position:0%
appropriate policy um even though it is
 
01:25:34.709 --> 01:25:34.719 align:start position:0%
an objectional basis um but as far as
 
01:25:36.669 --> 01:25:36.679 align:start position:0%
we're concerned as I said it's more of a
 
01:25:39.310 --> 01:25:39.320 align:start position:0%
technicality than anything we're
 
01:25:40.950 --> 01:25:40.960 align:start position:0%
extremely concerned
 
01:25:44.870 --> 01:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
about there are a number of comments
 
01:25:47.550 --> 01:25:47.560 align:start position:0%
about uh discrepancies between the rule
 
01:25:51.310 --> 01:25:51.320 align:start position:0%
text and the forms starting on page 19
 
01:25:54.790 --> 01:25:54.800 align:start position:0%
um they also go on on to page 21 22 24
 
01:25:58.030 --> 01:25:58.040 align:start position:0%
25 and 30 I will not get into all of
 
01:25:59.790 --> 01:25:59.800 align:start position:0%
those at this time unless someone has a
 
01:26:01.830 --> 01:26:01.840 align:start position:0%
specific question because once again the
 
01:26:04.430 --> 01:26:04.440 align:start position:0%
agency represented to me should they
 
01:26:08.310 --> 01:26:08.320 align:start position:0%
request a revised objection um today
 
01:26:10.109 --> 01:26:10.119 align:start position:0%
that they will go in and they will fix
 
01:26:11.990 --> 01:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
all those
 
01:26:16.470 --> 01:26:16.480 align:start position:0%
discrepancies um so uh in the home
 
01:26:19.870 --> 01:26:19.880 align:start position:0%
stretch here page 30 there's another
 
01:26:23.149 --> 01:26:23.159 align:start position:0%
unclear legisl legislative intent
 
01:26:26.750 --> 01:26:26.760 align:start position:0%
comment uh the agency has established a
 
01:26:31.950 --> 01:26:31.960 align:start position:0%
$20 fee to replace a lost decal for
 
01:26:35.030 --> 01:26:35.040 align:start position:0%
Moorings and in the statute the statute
 
01:26:40.590 --> 01:26:40.600 align:start position:0%
lays out fees for renewals um and other
 
01:26:43.990 --> 01:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
items but it does not say that there is
 
01:26:48.830 --> 01:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
a fee to replace a lost decal um so it
 
01:26:50.870 --> 01:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
seems to us that the agency does not
 
01:26:53.910 --> 01:26:53.920 align:start position:0%
have statutory Authority before this fee
 
01:26:55.390 --> 01:26:55.400 align:start position:0%
uh it was represented to me that this
 
01:27:00.109 --> 01:27:00.119 align:start position:0%
fee has been uh in place since the early
 
01:27:02.990 --> 01:27:03.000 align:start position:0%
2000s and was put into place as part of
 
01:27:05.709 --> 01:27:05.719 align:start position:0%
an initiative to reduce the fraudulent
 
01:27:07.830 --> 01:27:07.840 align:start position:0%
practice of obtaining a free decal and
 
01:27:10.990 --> 01:27:11.000 align:start position:0%
placing it on an illegal
 
01:27:13.750 --> 01:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
moing however the statute was never
 
01:27:16.990 --> 01:27:17.000 align:start position:0%
amended to include the fee so once again
 
01:27:18.990 --> 01:27:19.000 align:start position:0%
it would still be an objectional basis
 
01:27:20.669 --> 01:27:20.679 align:start position:0%
because there's no statutory Authority
 
01:27:23.550 --> 01:27:23.560 align:start position:0%
for the fee regardless the reason for
 
01:27:26.189 --> 01:27:26.199 align:start position:0%
it um and the final comment is an
 
01:27:28.030 --> 01:27:28.040 align:start position:0%
unclear comment on page
 
01:27:31.990 --> 01:27:32.000 align:start position:0%
30 um with regard to the decal renewal
 
01:27:33.950 --> 01:27:33.960 align:start position:0%
forms they had mentioned something about
 
01:27:36.070 --> 01:27:36.080 align:start position:0%
a special exemp
 
01:27:38.709 --> 01:27:38.719 align:start position:0%
exception which I had commented that
 
01:27:41.910 --> 01:27:41.920 align:start position:0%
there was no form submitted for that
 
01:27:43.990 --> 01:27:44.000 align:start position:0%
particular item however in talking with
 
01:27:46.550 --> 01:27:46.560 align:start position:0%
the department they clarified that there
 
01:27:48.990 --> 01:27:49.000 align:start position:0%
it's because there is no re renewal form
 
01:27:52.910 --> 01:27:52.920 align:start position:0%
for a special exception decal
 
01:27:54.709 --> 01:27:54.719 align:start position:0%
um because what happens is at the
 
01:27:56.950 --> 01:27:56.960 align:start position:0%
initial application a person will
 
01:27:59.470 --> 01:27:59.480 align:start position:0%
request that special exception which
 
01:28:01.390 --> 01:28:01.400 align:start position:0%
would allow them between two and four
 
01:28:04.070 --> 01:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
Moorings on their
 
01:28:06.270 --> 01:28:06.280 align:start position:0%
shorefront and when a person goes to
 
01:28:08.149 --> 01:28:08.159 align:start position:0%
renew they just use the regular renewal
 
01:28:10.149 --> 01:28:10.159 align:start position:0%
form and just put the number of Moorings
 
01:28:11.950 --> 01:28:11.960 align:start position:0%
they wish to renew so at this time that
 
01:28:13.950 --> 01:28:13.960 align:start position:0%
comment has been clarified and is no
 
01:28:13.960 --> 01:28:15.669 align:start position:0%
comment has been clarified and is no
longer

01:28:15.669 --> 01:28:15.679 align:start position:0%
longer
 
01:28:19.790 --> 01:28:19.800 align:start position:0%
valid I'm glad you got one confirmed all
 
01:28:23.070 --> 01:28:23.080 align:start position:0%
right Department good
 
01:28:25.270 --> 01:28:25.280 align:start position:0%
morning good morning uh attorney Dave
 
01:28:27.030 --> 01:28:27.040 align:start position:0%
hilts again for the Department of Safety
 
01:28:28.950 --> 01:28:28.960 align:start position:0%
uh with me today I have Captain uh Tim
 
01:28:31.510 --> 01:28:31.520 align:start position:0%
dun Levy of the uh Marine Patrol
 
01:28:34.430 --> 01:28:34.440 align:start position:0%
Division um so what I'd like to do is
 
01:28:36.229 --> 01:28:36.239 align:start position:0%
I'd like to address all of these you
 
01:28:37.830 --> 01:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
know at a higher level and I have the
 
01:28:39.510 --> 01:28:39.520 align:start position:0%
captain here if we need to delve into
 
01:28:41.709 --> 01:28:41.719 align:start position:0%
the you know background the facts of any
 
01:28:45.830 --> 01:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
particular uh one of these topics um as
 
01:28:48.350 --> 01:28:48.360 align:start position:0%
attorney Ricard uh stated our ultimate
 
01:28:51.229 --> 01:28:51.239 align:start position:0%
goal here today is to ask um for a
 
01:28:53.990 --> 01:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
revised objective from the committee um
 
01:28:55.310 --> 01:28:55.320 align:start position:0%
you know we'd like to we're going to
 
01:28:58.310 --> 01:28:58.320 align:start position:0%
address all of these comments um but um
 
01:29:00.189 --> 01:29:00.199 align:start position:0%
we think that a revised objection would
 
01:29:02.709 --> 01:29:02.719 align:start position:0%
give us the vehicle to address the
 
01:29:05.310 --> 01:29:05.320 align:start position:0%
things that can can be addressed without
 
01:29:07.510 --> 01:29:07.520 align:start position:0%
a legislative clarification which we do
 
01:29:11.030 --> 01:29:11.040 align:start position:0%
believe needs to happen on two of these
 
01:29:15.390 --> 01:29:15.400 align:start position:0%
um just going down the list um we do
 
01:29:18.390 --> 01:29:18.400 align:start position:0%
agree on the page three comment to um
 
01:29:19.910 --> 01:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
safe C
 
01:29:22.510 --> 01:29:22.520 align:start position:0%
40203 regarding personal flotation
 
01:29:25.830 --> 01:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
devices to Simply remove the blurbs that
 
01:29:27.790 --> 01:29:27.800 align:start position:0%
are really not rules that are just for
 
01:29:29.669 --> 01:29:29.679 align:start position:0%
informational purposes only so we'll
 
01:29:32.830 --> 01:29:32.840 align:start position:0%
delete those in a response to a revised
 
01:29:36.270 --> 01:29:36.280 align:start position:0%
objection um on the I'm just going to
 
01:29:38.990 --> 01:29:39.000 align:start position:0%
skip skip one uh if we could go to the
 
01:29:42.950 --> 01:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
page eight comment on the use of the
 
01:29:42.960 --> 01:29:44.229 align:start position:0%
page eight comment on the use of the
word

01:29:44.229 --> 01:29:44.239 align:start position:0%
word
 
01:29:48.830 --> 01:29:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:48.840 --> 01:29:50.910 align:start position:0%
 
safy

01:29:50.910 --> 01:29:50.920 align:start position:0%
safy
 
01:29:53.870 --> 01:29:53.880 align:start position:0%
40217 so the issue with this is that the
 
01:29:57.350 --> 01:29:57.360 align:start position:0%
statutory definition of raft means
 
01:30:01.189 --> 01:30:01.199 align:start position:0%
multiple boats attached together and the
 
01:30:04.189 --> 01:30:04.199 align:start position:0%
point of this particular section
 
01:30:09.109 --> 01:30:09.119 align:start position:0%
40217 is what types of lighting is safe
 
01:30:13.109 --> 01:30:13.119 align:start position:0%
um for the um you know voting uh public
 
01:30:14.790 --> 01:30:14.800 align:start position:0%
and and everybody else if you have
 
01:30:16.430 --> 01:30:16.440 align:start position:0%
something that you've attached to to
 
01:30:19.310 --> 01:30:19.320 align:start position:0%
your boat that floats so it doesn't have
 
01:30:21.950 --> 01:30:21.960 align:start position:0%
to be another boat it could be something
 
01:30:23.870 --> 01:30:23.880 align:start position:0%
else that you've attached to the boat
 
01:30:26.270 --> 01:30:26.280 align:start position:0%
that also floats that sort of expands
 
01:30:28.310 --> 01:30:28.320 align:start position:0%
the you know footprint of your boat and
 
01:30:30.030 --> 01:30:30.040 align:start position:0%
you really need to have some lights on
 
01:30:33.550 --> 01:30:33.560 align:start position:0%
that extra stuff um so that's that's why
 
01:30:35.709 --> 01:30:35.719 align:start position:0%
we have the different definition in here
 
01:30:37.990 --> 01:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
and that it's restricted by its own
 
01:30:41.990 --> 01:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
terms to that section only um if that's
 
01:30:43.590 --> 01:30:43.600 align:start position:0%
acceptable to the committee we'd like to
 
01:30:45.910 --> 01:30:45.920 align:start position:0%
keep that one that way so this is sort
 
01:30:47.750 --> 01:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
of like a trailer behind your boat
 
01:30:49.910 --> 01:30:49.920 align:start position:0%
that's exactly
 
01:30:53.149 --> 01:30:53.159 align:start position:0%
I good morning thank you um there's a
 
01:30:55.270 --> 01:30:55.280 align:start position:0%
lot of history to the de to to the the
 
01:30:58.030 --> 01:30:58.040 align:start position:0%
common applicable term of raft in the
 
01:31:00.229 --> 01:31:00.239 align:start position:0%
old days it could have been a log raft
 
01:31:02.390 --> 01:31:02.400 align:start position:0%
uh with the practice we see now on Squam
 
01:31:04.390 --> 01:31:04.400 align:start position:0%
Lake is when everybody brings their swim
 
01:31:05.750 --> 01:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
floats down into the river for the
 
01:31:08.270 --> 01:31:08.280 align:start position:0%
winter and they're towed multiple swim
 
01:31:10.510 --> 01:31:10.520 align:start position:0%
floats are being towed behind a boat for
 
01:31:12.270 --> 01:31:12.280 align:start position:0%
storage in the open water during the
 
01:31:15.109 --> 01:31:15.119 align:start position:0%
wintertime if they were Towing those
 
01:31:17.189 --> 01:31:17.199 align:start position:0%
rafts they would need a light if it was
 
01:31:20.070 --> 01:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
after dark the current definition in
 
01:31:22.430 --> 01:31:22.440 align:start position:0%
statute however was created
 
01:31:24.790 --> 01:31:24.800 align:start position:0%
when the legislature wanted to address
 
01:31:27.669 --> 01:31:27.679 align:start position:0%
the activity of rafting on sandbars
 
01:31:29.270 --> 01:31:29.280 align:start position:0%
where people would tie their boats
 
01:31:31.870 --> 01:31:31.880 align:start position:0%
together and drop anchor the legislature
 
01:31:34.669 --> 01:31:34.679 align:start position:0%
came up with a definition called a raft
 
01:31:37.510 --> 01:31:37.520 align:start position:0%
so it's really apples and oranges using
 
01:31:38.750 --> 01:31:38.760 align:start position:0%
the same
 
01:31:42.310 --> 01:31:42.320 align:start position:0%
term we've had that happen before
 
01:31:45.510 --> 01:31:45.520 align:start position:0%
yes questions okay thank you that seems
 
01:31:47.669 --> 01:31:47.679 align:start position:0%
clear enough and that is specifically to
 
01:31:50.470 --> 01:31:50.480 align:start position:0%
this section which makes sense all right
 
01:31:51.750 --> 01:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
please continue all right thank you
 
01:31:53.870 --> 01:31:53.880 align:start position:0%
thank you um I'm going to tackle the one
 
01:31:57.430 --> 01:31:57.440 align:start position:0%
on page two now um I'm sorry not page
 
01:32:01.709 --> 01:32:01.719 align:start position:0%
two the page five about the Practical
 
01:32:04.270 --> 01:32:04.280 align:start position:0%
exam um
 
01:32:06.870 --> 01:32:06.880 align:start position:0%
so I talked to the captain a lot about
 
01:32:09.030 --> 01:32:09.040 align:start position:0%
this um it sort of has a lot of history
 
01:32:11.550 --> 01:32:11.560 align:start position:0%
to it and I did learn a couple more
 
01:32:13.310 --> 01:32:13.320 align:start position:0%
things I think since I spoke to attorney
 
01:32:14.990 --> 01:32:15.000 align:start position:0%
Ricard and so I'll share that with the
 
01:32:17.870 --> 01:32:17.880 align:start position:0%
committee so you know this statute and
 
01:32:19.669 --> 01:32:19.679 align:start position:0%
it's um
 
01:32:22.990 --> 01:32:23.000 align:start position:0%
27022 uh was first enacted in 1990 and
 
01:32:26.790 --> 01:32:26.800 align:start position:0%
it was also amended in 2009 so 2009 is
 
01:32:29.229 --> 01:32:29.239 align:start position:0%
like a touch Point uh but it really goes
 
01:32:31.910 --> 01:32:31.920 align:start position:0%
back to 1990 and in speaking with the
 
01:32:35.750 --> 01:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
captain um he's been employed with the
 
01:32:39.270 --> 01:32:39.280 align:start position:0%
division of uh Marine Patrol pretty much
 
01:32:42.149 --> 01:32:42.159 align:start position:0%
that entire time and um what his memory
 
01:32:44.510 --> 01:32:44.520 align:start position:0%
is is that as far back as that
 
01:32:47.510 --> 01:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
legislation's been around when it says
 
01:32:50.590 --> 01:32:50.600 align:start position:0%
you can't operate a a commercial vessel
 
01:32:52.790 --> 01:32:52.800 align:start position:0%
without having taken an
 
01:32:56.189 --> 01:32:56.199 align:start position:0%
examination um that since the beginning
 
01:32:58.109 --> 01:32:58.119 align:start position:0%
they've implemented that with both a
 
01:33:01.430 --> 01:33:01.440 align:start position:0%
written and a practical exam and you
 
01:33:02.990 --> 01:33:03.000 align:start position:0%
know the reason is you know the written
 
01:33:05.030 --> 01:33:05.040 align:start position:0%
test okay yes you need to demonstrate
 
01:33:06.830 --> 01:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
that you know these things but on top of
 
01:33:09.229 --> 01:33:09.239 align:start position:0%
that the Practical part is that you have
 
01:33:11.149 --> 01:33:11.159 align:start position:0%
to demonstrate that you can actually
 
01:33:13.990 --> 01:33:14.000 align:start position:0%
operate the boat that you want to you
 
01:33:16.229 --> 01:33:16.239 align:start position:0%
know be a commercial operator of and
 
01:33:18.830 --> 01:33:18.840 align:start position:0%
it's that additional level of of Public
 
01:33:22.189 --> 01:33:22.199 align:start position:0%
Safety that the Practical exam affords
 
01:33:26.470 --> 01:33:26.480 align:start position:0%
um so when um I wasn't involved when the
 
01:33:30.149 --> 01:33:30.159 align:start position:0%
uh when this rule set went in um but we
 
01:33:35.910 --> 01:33:35.920 align:start position:0%
put in the blurb in 40207 e uh
 
01:33:37.910 --> 01:33:37.920 align:start position:0%
referencing the Practical exam so it was
 
01:33:41.750 --> 01:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
new to the rules but not new to Marine
 
01:33:45.109 --> 01:33:45.119 align:start position:0%
Patrol and neither was the written exam
 
01:33:47.030 --> 01:33:47.040 align:start position:0%
and you know the way that we've got it
 
01:33:49.790 --> 01:33:49.800 align:start position:0%
here in our objection response you know
 
01:33:52.590 --> 01:33:52.600 align:start position:0%
would specify that the part of the
 
01:33:55.109 --> 01:33:55.119 align:start position:0%
statute that exempts a person from the
 
01:33:57.470 --> 01:33:57.480 align:start position:0%
statute's requirements would exempt them
 
01:33:59.669 --> 01:33:59.679 align:start position:0%
from the written exam but not the
 
01:34:02.830 --> 01:34:02.840 align:start position:0%
Practical and again that goes back to
 
01:34:04.590 --> 01:34:04.600 align:start position:0%
the degree of Public Safety that we
 
01:34:06.990 --> 01:34:07.000 align:start position:0%
think is required so you you show us a
 
01:34:09.189 --> 01:34:09.199 align:start position:0%
federal license okay you obviously know
 
01:34:11.270 --> 01:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
enough where you know we don't have to
 
01:34:13.030 --> 01:34:13.040 align:start position:0%
be concerned about you taking the
 
01:34:15.030 --> 01:34:15.040 align:start position:0%
Practical exam but can you still drive
 
01:34:19.990 --> 01:34:20.000 align:start position:0%
that boat um and um so that's why from a
 
01:34:22.790 --> 01:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
policy um angle we we think it's
 
01:34:22.800 --> 01:34:25.350 align:start position:0%
policy um angle we we think it's
important

01:34:25.350 --> 01:34:25.360 align:start position:0%
important
 
01:34:28.629 --> 01:34:28.639 align:start position:0%
um I the way that it it's been written
 
01:34:30.950 --> 01:34:30.960 align:start position:0%
mentions both the written knowledge exam
 
01:34:33.470 --> 01:34:33.480 align:start position:0%
and the Practical exam and since I spoke
 
01:34:35.590 --> 01:34:35.600 align:start position:0%
to attorney Ricard I actually couldn't
 
01:34:38.590 --> 01:34:38.600 align:start position:0%
find a reference to the written exam in
 
01:34:40.550 --> 01:34:40.560 align:start position:0%
the rules maybe it's in there maybe I
 
01:34:43.430 --> 01:34:43.440 align:start position:0%
missed it but um so I just wanted to
 
01:34:45.790 --> 01:34:45.800 align:start position:0%
clarify that because that may not be
 
01:34:47.270 --> 01:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
accurate that the written exam was
 
01:34:50.109 --> 01:34:50.119 align:start position:0%
mentioned in the rules before too so um
 
01:34:51.950 --> 01:34:51.960 align:start position:0%
I think this is an opportunity for some
 
01:34:53.590 --> 01:34:53.600 align:start position:0%
legislative clarification if the
 
01:34:56.189 --> 01:34:56.199 align:start position:0%
committee agrees with the Department on
 
01:34:59.109 --> 01:34:59.119 align:start position:0%
the policy so that you know the statute
 
01:35:02.109 --> 01:35:02.119 align:start position:0%
can specify that the examination that's
 
01:35:05.270 --> 01:35:05.280 align:start position:0%
required has a written component has a
 
01:35:08.189 --> 01:35:08.199 align:start position:0%
practical component and if you agree
 
01:35:10.550 --> 01:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
that the exemption should cover one but
 
01:35:12.189 --> 01:35:12.199 align:start position:0%
not the other then that can be in the
 
01:35:14.550 --> 01:35:14.560 align:start position:0%
statute and it would put everybody on
 
01:35:16.629 --> 01:35:16.639 align:start position:0%
clear notice
 
01:35:20.350 --> 01:35:20.360 align:start position:0%
um the uh the next I'm sorry any
 
01:35:24.070 --> 01:35:24.080 align:start position:0%
comments yeah I mean I I I I don't
 
01:35:25.790 --> 01:35:25.800 align:start position:0%
disagree at all with what you say and my
 
01:35:27.510 --> 01:35:27.520 align:start position:0%
only concern though
 
01:35:30.750 --> 01:35:30.760 align:start position:0%
is until there's a legislative change I
 
01:35:32.709 --> 01:35:32.719 align:start position:0%
guess I have some question about the
 
01:35:34.629 --> 01:35:34.639 align:start position:0%
authority to I guess I have some
 
01:35:36.030 --> 01:35:36.040 align:start position:0%
question about the
 
01:35:39.109 --> 01:35:39.119 align:start position:0%
authority to to make this distinction in
 
01:35:41.109 --> 01:35:41.119 align:start position:0%
the in the
 
01:35:44.350 --> 01:35:44.360 align:start position:0%
regulations that's um did you yes did
 
01:35:46.990 --> 01:35:47.000 align:start position:0%
particularly since the uh people with
 
01:35:49.950 --> 01:35:49.960 align:start position:0%
Federal licenses are explicitly Exempted
 
01:35:53.790 --> 01:35:53.800 align:start position:0%
from the exam and and it doesn't specify
 
01:35:57.109 --> 01:35:57.119 align:start position:0%
which exam is
 
01:35:58.830 --> 01:35:58.840 align:start position:0%
involved thank you that's a good
 
01:36:02.070 --> 01:36:02.080 align:start position:0%
question and and I think what
 
01:36:05.350 --> 01:36:05.360 align:start position:0%
procedurally we've always considered the
 
01:36:07.109 --> 01:36:07.119 align:start position:0%
Practical exam an extension of the
 
01:36:09.310 --> 01:36:09.320 align:start position:0%
written or an extension of the process
 
01:36:11.390 --> 01:36:11.400 align:start position:0%
to get your credential because it only
 
01:36:14.510 --> 01:36:14.520 align:start position:0%
applies to certain boats um of s
 
01:36:17.550 --> 01:36:17.560 align:start position:0%
significant size uh we are not concerned
 
01:36:19.430 --> 01:36:19.440 align:start position:0%
about the person who's getting their
 
01:36:22.510 --> 01:36:22.520 align:start position:0%
commercial license to tow at a kids camp
 
01:36:26.149 --> 01:36:26.159 align:start position:0%
on on tubes um what we are concerned
 
01:36:28.910 --> 01:36:28.920 align:start position:0%
about is someone that applies for a
 
01:36:30.750 --> 01:36:30.760 align:start position:0%
commercial license in New Hampshire to
 
01:36:33.629 --> 01:36:33.639 align:start position:0%
drive the Mount Washington the Practical
 
01:36:36.669 --> 01:36:36.679 align:start position:0%
exam applies to the Mount Washington
 
01:36:38.310 --> 01:36:38.320 align:start position:0%
when someone comes to us with a federal
 
01:36:39.990 --> 01:36:40.000 align:start position:0%
credential perhaps it's a 100 ton
 
01:36:41.990 --> 01:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
captain's license or maybe it's just a
 
01:36:44.790 --> 01:36:44.800 align:start position:0%
six-pack license from the Sea Coast
 
01:36:46.629 --> 01:36:46.639 align:start position:0%
where they're they're a fishing
 
01:36:50.550 --> 01:36:50.560 align:start position:0%
charter um and they come to us with with
 
01:36:53.430 --> 01:36:53.440 align:start position:0%
book knowledge which we are readily
 
01:36:55.790 --> 01:36:55.800 align:start position:0%
accepting however they're looking to
 
01:36:57.629 --> 01:36:57.639 align:start position:0%
make that jump and drive the Mount
 
01:36:57.639 --> 01:36:59.189 align:start position:0%
make that jump and drive the Mount
Washington

01:36:59.189 --> 01:36:59.199 align:start position:0%
Washington
 
01:37:01.229 --> 01:37:01.239 align:start position:0%
conversely um you might have someone
 
01:37:03.709 --> 01:37:03.719 align:start position:0%
that's very capable of operating a a
 
01:37:05.510 --> 01:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
have a commercial pilot's license drives
 
01:37:07.070 --> 01:37:07.080 align:start position:0%
a operates a
 
01:37:11.709 --> 01:37:11.719 align:start position:0%
747 and now they want to do a uh um
 
01:37:15.109 --> 01:37:15.119 align:start position:0%
drive or a pilot a Cessna and just do c
 
01:37:17.270 --> 01:37:17.280 align:start position:0%
plane tours while that's not in the
 
01:37:19.149 --> 01:37:19.159 align:start position:0%
Boating realm it's an example of
 
01:37:21.790 --> 01:37:21.800 align:start position:0%
somebody with tremendous capability
 
01:37:24.149 --> 01:37:24.159 align:start position:0%
but can they go from from a large
 
01:37:27.629 --> 01:37:27.639 align:start position:0%
aircraft to a small Cessna that operates
 
01:37:29.510 --> 01:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
completely different and all we're
 
01:37:31.830 --> 01:37:31.840 align:start position:0%
concerned about is making sure that the
 
01:37:33.870 --> 01:37:33.880 align:start position:0%
vessel they're operating of of of a
 
01:37:36.189 --> 01:37:36.199 align:start position:0%
certain size they're capable of of
 
01:37:38.510 --> 01:37:38.520 align:start position:0%
operating uh in a practical sense rather
 
01:37:40.510 --> 01:37:40.520 align:start position:0%
than the book
 
01:37:43.870 --> 01:37:43.880 align:start position:0%
sense thank you totally agree yeah no I
 
01:37:46.350 --> 01:37:46.360 align:start position:0%
I mean I I I'm not I I completely
 
01:37:47.310 --> 01:37:47.320 align:start position:0%
understand what you're saying and I
 
01:37:50.470 --> 01:37:50.480 align:start position:0%
agree with you completely I that I don't
 
01:37:51.589 --> 01:37:51.599 align:start position:0%
think it still does doesn't really
 
01:37:54.830 --> 01:37:54.840 align:start position:0%
answer the question that it you know the
 
01:37:57.189 --> 01:37:57.199 align:start position:0%
to do that in this regulation does seem
 
01:38:00.950 --> 01:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
inconsistent with the statute and so I I
 
01:38:03.149 --> 01:38:03.159 align:start position:0%
you know I mean it would it really would
 
01:38:05.550 --> 01:38:05.560 align:start position:0%
be I think adding on to the statute
 
01:38:08.629 --> 01:38:08.639 align:start position:0%
which I don't I don't think the rules
 
01:38:10.030 --> 01:38:10.040 align:start position:0%
are supposed to do
 
01:38:12.950 --> 01:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
so you know what that says to us is we
 
01:38:14.470 --> 01:38:14.480 align:start position:0%
need to change we ought to change the
 
01:38:16.270 --> 01:38:16.280 align:start position:0%
statute and we ought to try to do that
 
01:38:18.430 --> 01:38:18.440 align:start position:0%
you know as soon as possible so if I
 
01:38:20.149 --> 01:38:20.159 align:start position:0%
could respond I I'd like to try to take
 
01:38:22.790 --> 01:38:22.800 align:start position:0%
another stab directly answering your
 
01:38:26.550 --> 01:38:26.560 align:start position:0%
question and um you know it's not a
 
01:38:28.189 --> 01:38:28.199 align:start position:0%
perfect solution I do think that the
 
01:38:29.669 --> 01:38:29.679 align:start position:0%
perfect solution would be to
 
01:38:32.510 --> 01:38:32.520 align:start position:0%
legislatively clarify this area as I've
 
01:38:36.629 --> 01:38:36.639 align:start position:0%
discussed but um one of the facts here
 
01:38:39.149 --> 01:38:39.159 align:start position:0%
is that um the department has rulemaking
 
01:38:43.350 --> 01:38:43.360 align:start position:0%
Authority in RSA 270 colon 11 uh and at
 
01:38:46.350 --> 01:38:46.360 align:start position:0%
Roman 1C uh gives the commissioner the
 
01:38:49.070 --> 01:38:49.080 align:start position:0%
authority to adopt rules relative to the
 
01:38:51.350 --> 01:38:51.360 align:start position:0%
classification examination and
 
01:38:53.390 --> 01:38:53.400 align:start position:0%
certification of captains Masters
 
01:38:55.790 --> 01:38:55.800 align:start position:0%
engineers and Pilots which are all the
 
01:38:57.830 --> 01:38:57.840 align:start position:0%
categories of who can operate
 
01:39:00.430 --> 01:39:00.440 align:start position:0%
commercially um operated or used on any
 
01:39:02.990 --> 01:39:03.000 align:start position:0%
public Waters of the state so that Ru
 
01:39:05.109 --> 01:39:05.119 align:start position:0%
making Authority is sitting there and
 
01:39:08.109 --> 01:39:08.119 align:start position:0%
it's on this subject so you know is it
 
01:39:10.189 --> 01:39:10.199 align:start position:0%
the cleanest thing no it's not the
 
01:39:13.430 --> 01:39:13.440 align:start position:0%
cleanest thing but we do have statutory
 
01:39:15.470 --> 01:39:15.480 align:start position:0%
Authority in this rulemaking to rule
 
01:39:18.350 --> 01:39:18.360 align:start position:0%
make on this topic so you know we could
 
01:39:21.709 --> 01:39:21.719 align:start position:0%
say that you know that the that that's
 
01:39:23.870 --> 01:39:23.880 align:start position:0%
the authority that we're exercising to
 
01:39:25.870 --> 01:39:25.880 align:start position:0%
cover this you know what we feel is an
 
01:39:28.750 --> 01:39:28.760 align:start position:0%
important Public Safety uh practice
 
01:39:31.030 --> 01:39:31.040 align:start position:0%
until the legislative clarification is
 
01:39:34.229 --> 01:39:34.239 align:start position:0%
made well thank you for that information
 
01:39:35.910 --> 01:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
but I don't think the commissioner's
 
01:39:38.629 --> 01:39:38.639 align:start position:0%
broad rulemaking Authority should be
 
01:39:41.550 --> 01:39:41.560 align:start position:0%
used to overwrite a specific statutory
 
01:39:44.070 --> 01:39:44.080 align:start position:0%
exemption which is what people with a
 
01:39:45.470 --> 01:39:45.480 align:start position:0%
federal license
 
01:39:49.629 --> 01:39:49.639 align:start position:0%
have and no I that's that's my take too
 
01:39:51.709 --> 01:39:51.719 align:start position:0%
I think it's uh it's un you know I mean
 
01:39:54.550 --> 01:39:54.560 align:start position:0%
you've got this specifically says this
 
01:39:57.750 --> 01:39:57.760 align:start position:0%
statute a person uh a person who has a
 
01:40:00.629 --> 01:40:00.639 align:start position:0%
federal license shall be deemed so
 
01:40:03.109 --> 01:40:03.119 align:start position:0%
that's um I think that's hard to get
 
01:40:05.550 --> 01:40:05.560 align:start position:0%
around that
 
01:40:09.109 --> 01:40:09.119 align:start position:0%
exactly right comments director moral uh
 
01:40:12.430 --> 01:40:12.440 align:start position:0%
one way to address that if the committee
 
01:40:14.790 --> 01:40:14.800 align:start position:0%
uh as a whole believes that they
 
01:40:17.310 --> 01:40:17.320 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have this right now uh but
 
01:40:20.990 --> 01:40:21.000 align:start position:0%
there is the agency wants to do a re
 
01:40:23.950 --> 01:40:23.960 align:start position:0%
rised objection to clean up other things
 
01:40:26.950 --> 01:40:26.960 align:start position:0%
you could Grant the revised objection
 
01:40:29.310 --> 01:40:29.320 align:start position:0%
and then with this issue remaining in
 
01:40:32.189 --> 01:40:32.199 align:start position:0%
the uh revised objection response you
 
01:40:34.189 --> 01:40:34.199 align:start position:0%
could if you wish enter a final
 
01:40:36.189 --> 01:40:36.199 align:start position:0%
objection they would still be able to
 
01:40:38.589 --> 01:40:38.599 align:start position:0%
adopt the rule but uh it would be over
 
01:40:40.910 --> 01:40:40.920 align:start position:0%
the committee's objection and if anyone
 
01:40:43.990 --> 01:40:44.000 align:start position:0%
challenged then uh the burden of proof
 
01:40:46.189 --> 01:40:46.199 align:start position:0%
would lay with the
 
01:40:48.030 --> 01:40:48.040 align:start position:0%
Department well we certainly want to
 
01:40:51.589 --> 01:40:51.599 align:start position:0%
Grant the Revis objections yes I think
 
01:40:54.109 --> 01:40:54.119 align:start position:0%
that that is the way to go
 
01:40:56.390 --> 01:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
because we'd love to get all the other
 
01:40:58.669 --> 01:40:58.679 align:start position:0%
details fixed but this one line
 
01:41:01.510 --> 01:41:01.520 align:start position:0%
specifically needs a legislative
 
01:41:03.669 --> 01:41:03.679 align:start position:0%
clarification that the exemption
 
01:41:07.189 --> 01:41:07.199 align:start position:0%
includes the entire gamut of testing or
 
01:41:09.270 --> 01:41:09.280 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't include the entire gam
 
01:41:11.470 --> 01:41:11.480 align:start position:0%
of testing whichever the way the
 
01:41:16.709 --> 01:41:16.719 align:start position:0%
legislation goes so I'll move to had to
 
01:41:20.030 --> 01:41:20.040 align:start position:0%
Revis the objection request okay is
 
01:41:22.669 --> 01:41:22.679 align:start position:0%
there Mo second second
 
01:41:26.830 --> 01:41:26.840 align:start position:0%
second do we need yeah attorney Hills
 
01:41:29.870 --> 01:41:29.880 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm sorry to um interrupt um that
 
01:41:31.310 --> 01:41:31.320 align:start position:0%
just the one thing I wanted to touch on
 
01:41:32.830 --> 01:41:32.840 align:start position:0%
too that needed a legislative
 
01:41:35.589 --> 01:41:35.599 align:start position:0%
clarification is that um replacement
 
01:41:38.350 --> 01:41:38.360 align:start position:0%
decal fee um oh we haven't even touched
 
01:41:40.830 --> 01:41:40.840 align:start position:0%
on the repl decal let's talk about that
 
01:41:42.870 --> 01:41:42.880 align:start position:0%
I was happy to get the uh the revised
 
01:41:45.470 --> 01:41:45.480 align:start position:0%
objection but I yeah we haven't got it
 
01:41:47.669 --> 01:41:47.679 align:start position:0%
yet so please continue about this Revis
 
01:41:49.189 --> 01:41:49.199 align:start position:0%
can I just can I just before I forget
 
01:41:51.070 --> 01:41:51.080 align:start position:0%
about can I just raise one issue I'm not
 
01:41:52.550 --> 01:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
sure whether how this would work out I
 
01:41:54.109 --> 01:41:54.119 align:start position:0%
certainly have this is the first thing
 
01:41:57.790 --> 01:41:57.800 align:start position:0%
that came up but in terms of changing
 
01:42:00.830 --> 01:42:00.840 align:start position:0%
legislation I have a bill that's before
 
01:42:03.910 --> 01:42:03.920 align:start position:0%
Transportation U that deals with uh
 
01:42:05.950 --> 01:42:05.960 align:start position:0%
trying to create an exemption for
 
01:42:09.229 --> 01:42:09.239 align:start position:0%
certain certain commercial uh the need
 
01:42:11.350 --> 01:42:11.360 align:start position:0%
for a commercial license it's it has
 
01:42:14.589 --> 01:42:14.599 align:start position:0%
nothing really to do with this but um it
 
01:42:16.270 --> 01:42:16.280 align:start position:0%
it's not it hasn't cleared
 
01:42:18.430 --> 01:42:18.440 align:start position:0%
Transportation yet and it might be that
 
01:42:22.109 --> 01:42:22.119 align:start position:0%
you could um work with uh uh
 
01:42:24.830 --> 01:42:24.840 align:start position:0%
representative Walsh to do a non-gain
 
01:42:26.950 --> 01:42:26.960 align:start position:0%
amendment to that bill that would that
 
01:42:29.790 --> 01:42:29.800 align:start position:0%
would include the changes that we're
 
01:42:31.270 --> 01:42:31.280 align:start position:0%
talking about here and that might be a
 
01:42:33.550 --> 01:42:33.560 align:start position:0%
way of getting that done now you know
 
01:42:37.470 --> 01:42:37.480 align:start position:0%
pretty quickly okay I believe so we will
 
01:42:39.750 --> 01:42:39.760 align:start position:0%
we'll do it that way representative Lynn
 
01:42:42.030 --> 01:42:42.040 align:start position:0%
will take the lead with the Department
 
01:42:44.310 --> 01:42:44.320 align:start position:0%
on getting the clarification on this
 
01:42:47.030 --> 01:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
testing requirement all right now about
 
01:42:50.189 --> 01:42:50.199 align:start position:0%
those uh replacement decals okay thank
 
01:42:51.270 --> 01:42:51.280 align:start position:0%
you very much
 
01:42:54.750 --> 01:42:54.760 align:start position:0%
um so as attorney Ricard uh teed up for
 
01:42:57.629 --> 01:42:57.639 align:start position:0%
the committee um what I've been able to
 
01:43:00.750 --> 01:43:00.760 align:start position:0%
find out about the fee is um as she said
 
01:43:03.229 --> 01:43:03.239 align:start position:0%
it's been around since the early 2000s
 
01:43:05.390 --> 01:43:05.400 align:start position:0%
that the captain can speak more to this
 
01:43:07.830 --> 01:43:07.840 align:start position:0%
but you know in terms of the why it
 
01:43:11.070 --> 01:43:11.080 align:start position:0%
exists and why we think it's important
 
01:43:17.109 --> 01:43:17.119 align:start position:0%
that it continue um is um to First deter
 
01:43:19.669 --> 01:43:19.679 align:start position:0%
the abuse of you know the ease of
 
01:43:21.910 --> 01:43:21.920 align:start position:0%
getting these decal and then you know
 
01:43:24.270 --> 01:43:24.280 align:start position:0%
like it was said putting it on illegal
 
01:43:26.950 --> 01:43:26.960 align:start position:0%
Moorings I don't like that at
 
01:43:30.629 --> 01:43:30.639 align:start position:0%
all the the other piece is excuse me
 
01:43:32.550 --> 01:43:32.560 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt you don't want
 
01:43:35.390 --> 01:43:35.400 align:start position:0%
what well we don't want this abuse that
 
01:43:37.510 --> 01:43:37.520 align:start position:0%
they're getting the the decal and then
 
01:43:41.550 --> 01:43:41.560 align:start position:0%
they're applying it on a right that's so
 
01:43:44.310 --> 01:43:44.320 align:start position:0%
the so the question is oh I've got other
 
01:43:46.510 --> 01:43:46.520 align:start position:0%
questions but please continue thank you
 
01:43:48.510 --> 01:43:48.520 align:start position:0%
um the the other piece is not just a
 
01:43:51.750 --> 01:43:51.760 align:start position:0%
pure deterrence but um the the amount of
 
01:43:54.990 --> 01:43:55.000 align:start position:0%
the fee covers the cost of Marine Patrol
 
01:43:58.070 --> 01:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
Personnel to physically go out on a boat
 
01:44:00.950 --> 01:44:00.960 align:start position:0%
and confirm that the issued replacement
 
01:44:04.310 --> 01:44:04.320 align:start position:0%
decal is put on a legal Mooring um so
 
01:44:06.709 --> 01:44:06.719 align:start position:0%
there's actually two parts to why we
 
01:44:08.470 --> 01:44:08.480 align:start position:0%
think that um you know it's important to
 
01:44:11.030 --> 01:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
continue to have that I think by this
 
01:44:14.629 --> 01:44:14.639 align:start position:0%
time it's clear that there's no existing
 
01:44:17.669 --> 01:44:17.679 align:start position:0%
uh statutory Authority for the fee um
 
01:44:20.430 --> 01:44:20.440 align:start position:0%
and there should be um so you know we
 
01:44:23.510 --> 01:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
would would love to um you know partner
 
01:44:25.870 --> 01:44:25.880 align:start position:0%
with member of Jil car for sponsorship
 
01:44:27.750 --> 01:44:27.760 align:start position:0%
or go out and seek another sponsor to
 
01:44:29.629 --> 01:44:29.639 align:start position:0%
get that legislative clarification to
 
01:44:32.229 --> 01:44:32.239 align:start position:0%
continue what we think is an important
 
01:44:34.510 --> 01:44:34.520 align:start position:0%
practice I have a question how many
 
01:44:36.750 --> 01:44:36.760 align:start position:0%
replacement decals are issued over the
 
01:44:39.070 --> 01:44:39.080 align:start position:0%
course of a year is that a large
 
01:44:41.870 --> 01:44:41.880 align:start position:0%
percentage of the total um it it varies
 
01:44:45.870 --> 01:44:45.880 align:start position:0%
from year to year um I would say that
 
01:44:48.790 --> 01:44:48.800 align:start position:0%
this past year we had something like 150
 
01:44:53.589 --> 01:44:53.599 align:start position:0%
of about 55 500 that we issue every year
 
01:44:56.229 --> 01:44:56.239 align:start position:0%
prior to the replacement fee being added
 
01:45:00.430 --> 01:45:00.440 align:start position:0%
in the rules uh we were seeing hundreds
 
01:45:03.430 --> 01:45:03.440 align:start position:0%
uh every year and and It ultimately
 
01:45:05.350 --> 01:45:05.360 align:start position:0%
would be a neighbor complaining that hey
 
01:45:07.709 --> 01:45:07.719 align:start position:0%
this morning's popped up in front of my
 
01:45:07.719 --> 01:45:09.030 align:start position:0%
this morning's popped up in front of my
neighbor's

01:45:09.030 --> 01:45:09.040 align:start position:0%
neighbor's
 
01:45:09.040 --> 01:45:10.830 align:start position:0%
neighbor's
Frontage

01:45:10.830 --> 01:45:10.840 align:start position:0%
Frontage
 
01:45:13.149 --> 01:45:13.159 align:start position:0%
anyway for whatever reason we would go
 
01:45:15.390 --> 01:45:15.400 align:start position:0%
down and find that that Not only was the
 
01:45:17.109 --> 01:45:17.119 align:start position:0%
replacement decal being displayed on a
 
01:45:19.270 --> 01:45:19.280 align:start position:0%
morning the original decal was being
 
01:45:21.589 --> 01:45:21.599 align:start position:0%
displayed on a second morning
 
01:45:24.589 --> 01:45:24.599 align:start position:0%
and so uh when when you look at the the
 
01:45:26.870 --> 01:45:26.880 align:start position:0%
value in being able to have your boat on
 
01:45:29.830 --> 01:45:29.840 align:start position:0%
the water often times it becomes a
 
01:45:31.870 --> 01:45:31.880 align:start position:0%
revenue stream for a person with
 
01:45:33.629 --> 01:45:33.639 align:start position:0%
shorefront property to be able to
 
01:45:37.189 --> 01:45:37.199 align:start position:0%
provide Moorings to people and so uh the
 
01:45:40.109 --> 01:45:40.119 align:start position:0%
legislative uh uh language in the
 
01:45:42.510 --> 01:45:42.520 align:start position:0%
statute says they are not for rent this
 
01:45:44.750 --> 01:45:44.760 align:start position:0%
is not to be a money-making uh
 
01:45:47.430 --> 01:45:47.440 align:start position:0%
Enterprise in in in providing Mings to
 
01:45:51.470 --> 01:45:51.480 align:start position:0%
people so uh there is value in those DEC
 
01:45:54.430 --> 01:45:54.440 align:start position:0%
and so it it requires us to go out and
 
01:45:56.709 --> 01:45:56.719 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're truly seeing the
 
01:45:59.629 --> 01:45:59.639 align:start position:0%
replacement decal uh being used uh in
 
01:46:01.790 --> 01:46:01.800 align:start position:0%
the spirit of a
 
01:46:06.830 --> 01:46:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:08.709 --> 01:46:08.719 align:start position:0%
enlightening all right any other
 
01:46:10.990 --> 01:46:11.000 align:start position:0%
questions C can I just raise a question
 
01:46:12.470 --> 01:46:12.480 align:start position:0%
about this is one that has not been
 
01:46:15.270 --> 01:46:15.280 align:start position:0%
referenced earlier but I saw on page one
 
01:46:22.390 --> 01:46:22.400 align:start position:0%
of the proposed change in the in saf C4
 
01:46:25.629 --> 01:46:25.639 align:start position:0%
01.03 the commercial vessel
 
01:46:29.109 --> 01:46:29.119 align:start position:0%
definition and I I guess this is sort of
 
01:46:30.790 --> 01:46:30.800 align:start position:0%
along the lines of of a comment that was
 
01:46:33.589 --> 01:46:33.599 align:start position:0%
made earlier by the staff regarding
 
01:46:36.189 --> 01:46:36.199 align:start position:0%
something later but where the last
 
01:46:38.510 --> 01:46:38.520 align:start position:0%
sentence of that says this term includes
 
01:46:41.390 --> 01:46:41.400 align:start position:0%
any vessel carrying passengers for
 
01:46:44.790 --> 01:46:44.800 align:start position:0%
hire as a common carrier of passengers
 
01:46:49.390 --> 01:46:49.400 align:start position:0%
or property that seems to me to
 
01:46:53.310 --> 01:46:53.320 align:start position:0%
be really confused so if I have a vessel
 
01:46:53.320 --> 01:46:56.390 align:start position:0%
be really confused so if I have a vessel
that

01:46:56.390 --> 01:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:59.470 --> 01:46:59.480 align:start position:0%
carries that commonly carries property
 
01:47:03.470 --> 01:47:03.480 align:start position:0%
only is that covered by this or
 
01:47:05.750 --> 01:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
not ultimately sir it would depend on
 
01:47:07.910 --> 01:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
the length of the vessel being used
 
01:47:09.750 --> 01:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
we're not concerned about the gentleman
 
01:47:12.709 --> 01:47:12.719 align:start position:0%
who is for higher higher hauling plywood
 
01:47:13.950 --> 01:47:13.960 align:start position:0%
out to an island for someone on a
 
01:47:16.510 --> 01:47:16.520 align:start position:0%
pontoon booat but if you've got a 60ft
 
01:47:18.510 --> 01:47:18.520 align:start position:0%
barge with an excavator hauling sand for
 
01:47:22.510 --> 01:47:22.520 align:start position:0%
a septic system then then it would
 
01:47:26.030 --> 01:47:26.040 align:start position:0%
apply if I understood question so that a
 
01:47:29.070 --> 01:47:29.080 align:start position:0%
small boat that carries passengers for H
 
01:47:32.950 --> 01:47:32.960 align:start position:0%
would qualify as commercial but carrying
 
01:47:36.990 --> 01:47:37.000 align:start position:0%
Freight in on a small boat would not
 
01:47:39.790 --> 01:47:39.800 align:start position:0%
apply it would still meet the definition
 
01:47:41.270 --> 01:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
of commercial and they would need to
 
01:47:43.070 --> 01:47:43.080 align:start position:0%
have a commercial license but they would
 
01:47:46.430 --> 01:47:46.440 align:start position:0%
not have to have the Practical exam ah
 
01:47:49.310 --> 01:47:49.320 align:start position:0%
thank you but okay thank
 
01:47:52.550 --> 01:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
you um and and just on that point as
 
01:47:56.310 --> 01:47:56.320 align:start position:0%
well uh the statute statutory definition
 
01:47:58.950 --> 01:47:58.960 align:start position:0%
also kind of includes it anyway um it
 
01:48:01.390 --> 01:48:01.400 align:start position:0%
says a commercial vessel means any
 
01:48:03.589 --> 01:48:03.599 align:start position:0%
vessel used as a common carrier of
 
01:48:06.430 --> 01:48:06.440 align:start position:0%
passengers or property operating on a
 
01:48:10.189 --> 01:48:10.199 align:start position:0%
reg regular schedule so this just
 
01:48:13.550 --> 01:48:13.560 align:start position:0%
clarifies that that also applies for
 
01:48:17.390 --> 01:48:17.400 align:start position:0%
those boats that Do it For Hire not just
 
01:48:18.750 --> 01:48:18.760 align:start position:0%
as part of their own business but also
 
01:48:20.669 --> 01:48:20.679 align:start position:0%
for hire so it's also kind of
 
01:48:22.870 --> 01:48:22.880 align:start position:0%
implemented in the statute itself so
 
01:48:25.669 --> 01:48:25.679 align:start position:0%
that includes water taxes as well as
 
01:48:31.070 --> 01:48:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:34.550 --> 01:48:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:37.270 --> 01:48:37.280 align:start position:0%
right so
 
01:48:41.910 --> 01:48:41.920 align:start position:0%
um director we do have a uh motion on
 
01:48:47.350 --> 01:48:47.360 align:start position:0%

requirements and this bill with don't we
 
01:49:18.030 --> 01:49:18.040 align:start position:0%
also need something on the fee I was
 
01:49:21.030 --> 01:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
just about to get to that sorry sorry
 
01:49:22.870 --> 01:49:22.880 align:start position:0%

01:49:26.390 --> 01:49:26.400 align:start position:0%
in taking on the issue of the authorized
 
01:49:33.149 --> 01:49:33.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:36.550 --> 01:49:36.560 align:start position:0%

01:49:39.350 --> 01:49:39.360 align:start position:0%
okay thank you that that would require
 
01:49:39.360 --> 01:49:40.669 align:start position:0%
okay thank you that that would require
an

01:49:40.669 --> 01:49:40.679 align:start position:0%
an
 
01:49:43.030 --> 01:49:43.040 align:start position:0%
amendment preferably somewhere on
 
01:49:46.390 --> 01:49:46.400 align:start position:0%
something in ways and means but U work

01:49:54.109 --> 01:49:54.119 align:start position:0%
is it it sounds like it's a very
 
01:49:56.870 --> 01:49:56.880 align:start position:0%
reasonable fee and in fact that $25 may
 
01:49:57.830 --> 01:49:57.840 align:start position:0%
not be
 
01:50:00.550 --> 01:50:00.560 align:start position:0%
enough so Madam chair just to clarify
 
01:50:03.950 --> 01:50:03.960 align:start position:0%
the motion is is to
 
01:50:07.149 --> 01:50:07.159 align:start position:0%

which did go into effect last year but
 
01:51:19.149 --> 01:51:19.159 align:start position:0%

builders asso ation is still talking
 
01:51:23.189 --> 01:51:23.199 align:start position:0%
with the Department about the issues
 
01:51:26.390 --> 01:51:26.400 align:start position:0%
that he had concerns about yes I I heard
 
01:51:29.390 --> 01:51:29.400 align:start position:0%
that also other than that it would just
 
01:51:32.390 --> 01:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
be if the committee wish to
 
01:51:35.390 --> 01:51:35.400 align:start position:0%
uh vote to not hold its uh public
 
01:51:38.350 --> 01:51:38.360 align:start position:0%
